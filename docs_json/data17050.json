Fine roots also play a major role in the global carbon (C) cycle, mainly \nthrough production, respiration, exudation and decomposition processes. Improving \nour understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of fine roots and greenhouse gases \nin deep soil layers is a key component to identify more sustainable silvicultural \npractices for planted forests in a context of climate change and to improve the current \nbiogeochemical models.  \n\nOur study aimed to assess the effect of clear-cutting and drought on fine-root \nproduction, soil CO2, CH4 and N2O effluxes and production throughout deep soil \nprofiles down to the water table in Brazilian coppice-managed Eucalyptus plantations. \nFine roots (i.e. diameter &lt;2 mm) were sampled down to a depth of 17 m in a throughfall \nexclusion experiment comparing stands with 37% of throughfall excluded by plastic \nsheets (-W) and stands without rain exclusion (+W). Root dynamics were studied using \nminirhizotron in two permanent pits down to a depth of 17 m in treatments -W and +W, \nover 1 year before clear-cutting, then over 2 years in coppice, as well as down to a \ndepth of 4 m in a non-harvested plot (NH) serving as a control. CO2, CH4 and N2O \nsurface effluxes were measured over three years using the closed-chamber method in \ntreatments -W, +W and NH. CO2, CH4 and N2O concentrations in the soil were \nmeasured from the pits down to a depth of 15.5 m in treatments -W, +W and NH over \n3 months before the clear-cut and 1.5 years after in coppice. \n\nAfter harvesting, spectacular fine root growth of trees conducted in coppice occurred \nin very deep soil layers (> 13 m) and, surprisingly, root mortality remained extremely \nlow whatever the depth and the treatment. Total fine-root biomass in coppice down to \na depth of 17 m was 1266 and 1017 g m-2 in treatments +W and -W, respectively, at \n1.5 years after the clear-cut and was 1078 g m-2 in NH 7.5 years after planting. Specific \nroot length and specific root area were about 15% higher in -W than in +W. CO2, CH4, \nand N2O effluxes were not significantly different between treatments -W and +W and \ndid not change after clear-cutting in the coppice-managed stands compared to non-\nharvested stand. CO2 and CH4 concentrations greatly increased with depth and N2O \nconcentrations remained roughly constant from the soil surface down to a depth of \n15.5 m. Mean CO2 and N2O concentrations in -W were 20.7% and 7.6% lower than in \n+W, respectively, and CH4 concentrations in -W were 44.4% higher than in +W \nthroughout the soil profiles. A diffusivity model showed that CO2, N2O and CH4 \nproduction and consumption occurred at great depths and were similar in treatments \n+W, -W and NH. Clear-cutting did not increase CO2, CH4 and N2O effluxes and \nproductions, whatever the water supply regime. \n\nEstablishing deep root systems in tropical planted forests could help trees withstand \nthe long drought periods expected under climate change in many tropical regions. Our \nstudy suggested that coppice management might be an interesting option in tropical \nEucalyptus plantations, both to improve tree tolerance to drought and store carbon at \ngreat depth in the soil. Consequences of climate changes on greenhouse gas \nemissions could be minor when tropical Eucalyptus plantations are coppice managed.  \n\nKeywords: Brazil.

A ra\u00edzes finas foram amostradas at\u00e9 17 m de profundidade num \nexperimento de exclus\u00e3o de chuva comparando parcelas com 37% de precipita\u00e7\u00e3o \nexclu\u00edda (-W) e sem exclus\u00e3o de chuva (+ W). A din\u00e2mica das ra\u00edzes foi estudada \nusando minirhizotron em duas trincheiras permanentes at\u00e9 17 m de profundidade nos \ntratamentos -W e + W, durante 1 ano antes do corte raso e 2 anos depois do corte em \ntalhadia, e tambem at\u00e9 4 m de profundidade numa parcela sem corte (NH), servindo \ncomo controle. Os efluxos de CO2, CH4 e N2O na superf\u00edcie do solo foram medidos ao \nlongo de tr\u00eas anos utilizando o m\u00e9todo de c\u00e2mara manual nos tratamentos -W, + W e \nNH. As concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de CO2, CH4 e N2O no solo foram medidas a partir das \ntrincheiras at\u00e9 uma profundidade de 15.5 m nos tratamentos -W, + W e NH durante 3 \nmeses antes do corte raso e 1.5 ano depois em talhadia.  \n\nAp\u00f3s o corte, ocorreu um grande crescimento radicular das \u00e1rvores conduzidas em \ntalhadia nas camadas muito profundas do solo (> 13 m) e, surpreendentemente, a \nmortalidade das ra\u00edzes permaneceu extremamente baixa, independentemente da \nprofundidade e do tratamento. A biomassa total de ra\u00edzes finas em talhadia at\u00e9 17 m \nde profundidade foi de 1266 e 1017 g m-2 em + W e -W, respectivamente, 1.5 ano \nap\u00f3s o corte raso, e 1078 g m-2 em NH 7.5 anos ap\u00f3s o plantio. O comprimento \nespec\u00edfico e a \u00e1rea espec\u00edfica das ra\u00edzes foram cerca de 15% maiores em -W do que \nem + W. Os efluxos de CO2, CH4 e N2O n\u00e3o foram significativamente diferentes entre \n-W e + W e n\u00e3o alteraram ap\u00f3s o corte raso nas parcelas manejadas por talhadia em \ncompara\u00e7\u00e3o com o povoamento n\u00e3o colhido. As concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de CO2 e CH4 \naumentaram muito com a profundidade e as concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de N2O permaneceram \naproximadamente constantes na superf\u00edcie do solo at\u00e9 uma profundidade de 15.5 m. \nAs concentra\u00e7\u00f5es m\u00e9dias de CO2 e N2O em -W foram 20.7% e 7.6% menores que em \n+ W, respectivamente, e as concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de CH4 em -W foram 44.4% maiores que \nem + W em todo o perfil de solo. Um modelo de difusividade mostrou que a produ\u00e7\u00e3o \ne o consumo de CO2, N2O e CH4 ocorreram em grandes profundidades e foram \nsimilares nos tratamentos + W, -W e NH. O corte raso n\u00e3o aumentou os efluxos e as \nprodu\u00e7\u00f5es de CO2, CH4 e N2O, independentemente do regime de abastecimento de \n\u00e1gua.  \n\nO estabelecimento de sistemas radiculares profundos em florestas tropicais plantadas \npode ajudar as \u00e1rvores a resistir aos longos per\u00edodos de seca esperados pelas \nmudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas em muitas regi\u00f5es tropicais Nosso estudo em planta\u00e7\u00f5es de \neucaliptos manejados em talhadia, representativas de grandes \u00e1reas tropicais, sugere \nque as emiss\u00f5es de gases de efeito estufa podem ser pouco influenciadas pelas \nmudan\u00e7as nos padr\u00f5es de precipita\u00e7\u00e3o devido \u00e0s mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas. \n\nPalavras-chave: Brazil.

Ra\u00edzes finas tamb\u00e9m desempenham um papel \n\nimportante no ciclo global de carbono (C), principalmente nos processos de produ\u00e7\u00e3o, \n\nrespira\u00e7\u00e3o, exsuda\u00e7\u00e3o e decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o. Melhorar a compreens\u00e3o da din\u00e2mica \n\nespa\u00e7o-temporal de ra\u00edzes finas ao longo de todo o perfil do solo at\u00e9 o len\u00e7ol fre\u00e1tico \n\n\u00e9 importante para identificar pr\u00e1ticas silviculturais mais sustent\u00e1veis para as florestas \n\nplantadas. Ap\u00f3s uma forte expans\u00e3o nos \u00faltimos 20 anos, as planta\u00e7\u00f5es florestais \n\nrepresentam 7% da \u00e1rea florestal total do mundo (KEENAN et al., 2015). Em regi\u00f5es \n\ntropicais e subtropicais, as planta\u00e7\u00f5es industriais de eucalipto de r\u00e1pido crescimento, \n\nparticipam no armazenamento de carbono atmosf\u00e9rico e ajudam a reduzir a \n\nexplora\u00e7\u00e3o das florestas naturais fornecendo um propor\u00e7\u00e3o crescente da demanda \n\nmundial em madeira (KEENAN et al., 2015). As planta\u00e7\u00f5es de eucalipto de r\u00e1pido \n\ncrescimento cobrem cerca de 20 milh\u00f5es de hectares em todo o mundo (BOOTH, \n\n2013), incluindo cerca de 5.67 milh\u00f5es de hectares no Brasil (IBA, 2016). As florestas \n\ntropicais t\u00eam uma forte influ\u00eancia nas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de di\u00f3xido de carbono (CO2), \n\n\u00f3xido nitroso (N2O) e metano (CH4) na atmosfera. As pr\u00e1ticas silviculturais nas \n\nflorestas plantadas afetam os fluxos de gases de efeito estufa na superf\u00edcie do solo e \n\nos principais determinantes da produ\u00e7\u00e3o de gases de efeito estufa nos solos florestais \n\n(substrato, temperatura, teor de \u00e1gua) variam em fun\u00e7\u00e3o da profundidade do solo. No \n\nBrasil, a maioria das planta\u00e7\u00f5es de eucalipto s\u00e3o estabelecidas em solos com baixa \n\nfertilidade e submetidas a per\u00edodos de seca de at\u00e9 6 meses (GON\u00c7ALVES et al., \n\n2013). Apesar das proje\u00e7\u00f5es sobre o futuro das precipita\u00e7\u00f5es ainda sejam dif\u00edceis de \n\nprever em n\u00edvel local, estudos mostraram que o aquecimento global ser\u00e1 associado a \n\numa intensifica\u00e7\u00e3o das esta\u00e7\u00f5es secas em muitas partes do globo (SOLOMON et al., \n\n2009). especialmente em regi\u00f5es subtropicais j\u00e1 sujeitas a secas severas (MEEHL et \n\nal., 2007). Neste contexto, o manejo do Eucalyptus atrav\u00e9s da talhadia tem sido \n\npraticado por empresas do setor florestal no Brasil e pode ser uma vantagem contra \n\no estresse h\u00eddrico, uma vez que as brota\u00e7\u00f5es do Eucalyptus j\u00e1 possuem um sistema \n\nradicular formado em camadas profundas, onde as quantidades de \u00e1gua dispon\u00edveis \n\npodem ser maiores. As conseq\u00fc\u00eancias do corte raso das \u00e1rvores na din\u00e2mica \n\nradicular no primeiro ano de rota\u00e7\u00e3o de planta\u00e7\u00f5es em talhadia implicam quest\u00f5es \n\n\n\n \n \n\n        \n \n\nespec\u00edficas nunca estudadas nas camadas profundas do solo. Al\u00e9m disso, o corte da \n\nparte a\u00e9rea das \u00e1rvores tem um impacto significativo na sa\u00edda de carbono do \n\necossistema e nas emiss\u00f5es de gases de efeito estufa. Ap\u00f3s o corte, a mortalidade \n\ndas ra\u00edzes leva \u00e0 um suprimento de mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica fresca em diferentes \n\nprofundidades (BERHONGARAY et al., 2015). A decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o da mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica \n\nfresca pode promover a degrada\u00e7\u00e3o da mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica existente (DERRIEN et al., \n\n2014; FONTAINE et al., 2007) com um \"efeito priming\" (KUZYAKOV et al., 2000). O \n\n\"efeito priming\" pode afetar o armazenamento de carbono pelo ecossistema e afetar \n\nindiretamente o ciclo do nitrog\u00eanio. Existe pouca pesquisa sobre os ciclos \n\nbiogeoqu\u00edmicos em planta\u00e7\u00f5es florestais manejadas em talhadia, e nenhuma \n\ncomparando experimentalmente estresse h\u00eddrico (exclus\u00e3o de chuva) e precipita\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nnormal. A avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da contribui\u00e7\u00e3o das ra\u00edzes finas profundas e da din\u00e2mica espa\u00e7o-\n\ntemporal das concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de gases de efeito estufa nas camadas profundas do solo \n\n\u00e9 um verdadeiro desafio metrol\u00f3gico e uma grande barreira cient\u00edfica, a qual \u00e9 \n\nimportante levantar para estudar a sustentabilidade das planta\u00e7\u00f5es florestais e sua \n\nresili\u00eancia no contexto das mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas globais. O objetivo principal da tese \n\n\u00e9 avaliar o efeito do corte e da redu\u00e7\u00e3o de chuva na produ\u00e7\u00e3o das ra\u00edzes finas, CO2, \n\nCH4 e N2O ao longo do perfil do solo at\u00e9 o len\u00e7ol fre\u00e1tico. Estes efeitos foram \n\nacompanhados antes e ap\u00f3s o corte raso das \u00e1rvores em uma planta\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nEucalyptus grandis conduzida em talhadia e submetida \u00e0 dois regimes h\u00eddricos \n\ncontrastantes. \n\nOs objetivos espec\u00edficos da tese s\u00e3o: \n\n- Melhorar a compreens\u00e3o da influ\u00eancia das chuvas sobre a mortalidade e a \n\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o de ra\u00edzes finas em fun\u00e7\u00e3o da profundidade do solo em planta\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nconduzidas por talhadia; \n\n- Avaliar o efeito do corte raso e do manejo em talhadia sobre a din\u00e2mica das \n\nra\u00edzes finas at\u00e9 17 m de profundidade; \n\n- Avaliar a din\u00e2mica de ra\u00edzes finas, CO2, CH4 e N2O pr\u00f3xima ao len\u00e7ol fre\u00e1tico \n\n(17 m de profundidade) em tratamentos com dois n\u00edveis de pluviosidade \n\ncontrastantes; \n\n- Determinar o perfil vertical das taxas de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de CO2, CH4 e N2O a partir \n\nda superf\u00edcie at\u00e9 uma profundidade de 17 m, atrav\u00e9s de amostragens dos \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\ngases, seguida de an\u00e1lises por cromatografia gasosa e modelagem da \n\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o e do transporte no solo. \n\nEstrat\u00e9gia de pesquisa \n\nOs experimentos deste doutorado ocorreram no Brasil, na Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Experimental de \n\nItatinga (Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo), destinada \u00e0 descri\u00e7\u00e3o, quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o e modelagem do \n\nfuncionamento dos ecossistemas florestais tropicais. A precipita\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e9dia anual nesta \n\n\u00e1rea \u00e9 de 1390 mm; a vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o dominante \u00e9 o eucalipto; o solo \u00e9 muito profundo (> \n\n15m) do tipo arenoso ferral\u00edtico (LACLAU et al., 2010). Uma planta\u00e7\u00e3o de Eucalyptus \n\ngrandis de mais de dois hectares foi instalada em 2010 em um delineamento em \n\nparcelas subdivididas (split-plot) com 3 blocos. O principal fator estudado \u00e9 a redu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nda chuva e o fator secund\u00e1rio \u00e9 a fertiliza\u00e7\u00e3o pot\u00e1ssica. O trabalho de tese concentra-\n\nse em modalidades com aduba\u00e7\u00e3o pot\u00e1ssica n\u00e3o limitante como em planta\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ncomerciais no Brasil, comparando chuvas n\u00e3o perturbadas e exclus\u00e3o parcial por um \n\nsistema de calhas para coletar e excluir 37% das chuvas.  \n\nDuas trincheiras profundas (17 m de profundidade x 1.5 m de di\u00e2metro) foram \n\nescavadas no in\u00edcio de 2014 em tratamentos com e sem exclus\u00e3o de chuva e est\u00e3o \n\nequipadas com plataformas que facilitam a manipula\u00e7\u00e3o e medi\u00e7\u00f5es em \n\nprofundidades diferentes. \n\nAs \u00e1rvores foram cortadas no experimento em junho de 2016, com a idade de 6 anos, \n\ne a planta\u00e7\u00e3o foi conduzida em talhadia ap\u00f3s o corte raso. No entanto, uma parcela \n\nde refer\u00eancia (NH) foi mantida com as \u00e1rvores existentes (fertiliza\u00e7\u00e3o e chuvas n\u00e3o \n\nperturbadas). Nesta parcela, uma terceira trincheira de 3 m de profundidade foi \n\nescavada e preparada. \n\nDesde sua cria\u00e7\u00e3o em 2014, as duas trincheiras profundas foram equipadas com \n\nminirhizotrons para monitorar a din\u00e2mica das ra\u00edzes (MAEGHT et al., 2013). Vinte e \n\nquatro tubos transparentes de 180 cm de comprimento foram instalados a 45\u00b0 dentro \n\ndas trincheiras permanentes (12 por trincheira) e permitiram a observa\u00e7\u00e3o das ra\u00edzes \n\n130 cm abaixo de cada ponto de instala\u00e7\u00e3o (na superf\u00edcie, 1.0, 3.5, 5.5, 7.5, 9.5, 11.5, \n\n13.5 e 15.5 m). Sete tubos foram instalados na parcela de refer\u00eancia (superf\u00edcie, 1 e \n\n3.5 m). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n        \n \n\nA observa\u00e7\u00e3o das ra\u00edzes foi realizada por aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de imagem por meio de um \n\nscanner circular (CI-600 Root Growth Monitoring System, CID, EUA). Oito imagens \n\n(21.59 cm x 19.56 cent\u00edmetros) no tubo foram tomadas a cada duas semanas desde \n\nMaio de 2015: um ano antes do corte das \u00e1rvores e durante 2 anos ap\u00f3s o corte das \n\n\u00e1rvores, em Junho de 2016. As imagens foram analisadas usando o software \n\nWinRHIZOtron (Regent, Canad\u00e1) para tra\u00e7ar as ra\u00edzes, marcando o comprimento e \n\ndi\u00e2metro para estimar o crescimento ao longo do tempo.  \n\nRa\u00edzes finas (di\u00e2metro&lt;2 mm) foram amostradas at\u00e9 a profundidade de 17 m para \n\nestimar a biomassa (ra\u00edzes vivas) e necromassa em todo o perfil do solo, 1.5 anos \n\nap\u00f3s o corte nos tratamentos + W, -W e 7.5 anos ap\u00f3s o plantio no tratamento NH. \n\nAs emiss\u00f5es de gases do solo  foram medidas colocando um sino (di\u00e2metro de 40 \n\ncm, altura de 10 cm) sobre uma base de amostragem instalada no local experimental. \n\nQuatro c\u00e2maras foram colocadas aleatoriamente \u00e0 quatro dist\u00e2ncias das \u00e1rvores em \n\ncada tratamento. As c\u00e2maras foram fechadas cada vez por 30 minutos. Uma al\u00edquota \n\nde ar ambiente foi\u00e9 coletada com uma seringa quatro vezes consecutivas (0, 10 min, \n\n20 min e 30 min) ap\u00f3s o fechamento. As medi\u00e7\u00f5es foram feitas a cada duas semanas: \n\ntr\u00eas meses antes do corte e 1.5 anos ap\u00f3s o corte. C\u00e2maras de respira\u00e7\u00e3o no solo (9 \n\npor tratamento e bloco) tamb\u00e9m foram conectadas \u00e0 um analisador Li-Cor 8100 (Li-\n\ncor, Lincoln, Ne, EUA) para monitorar as emiss\u00f5es de CO2 na superf\u00edcie do solo \n\nmedido a cada duas semanas. Para coletar regularmente os gases do solo (duas \n\nvezes por m\u00eas: tr\u00eas meses antes do corte e 1.5 anos ap\u00f3s o corte), as trincheiras \n\nforam equipadas com seringas instaladas em profundidades (METAY et al., 2007) \n\ntamb\u00e9m cobertas por imagens de minirhizotrons (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 3.5, 7.5, 11.5 e 15.5 \n\nm). As concentra\u00e7\u00f5es dos gases foram determinadas por cromatografia gasosa (GC-\n\nECD). Os dados foram aplicados \u00e0 um modelo de difusividade para estimar os fluxos \n\nde CO2, N2O e CH4, bem como a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de cada camada de solo a partir das \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00f5es medidas nas trincheiras. \n\nPrincipais resultados \n\nO sistema de redu\u00e7\u00e3o de chuva implantado resultou em uma diminui\u00e7\u00e3o significativa \n\ndo conte\u00fado de \u00e1gua do solo, em m\u00e9dia uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o de 12.9% em -W em \n\ncompara\u00e7\u00e3o ao + W, da superf\u00edcie a uma profundidade de 16 m. Este dispositivo \n\nmostrou-se eficaz para estudar dois regimes de precipita\u00e7\u00e3o contrastante. Ap\u00f3s o \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\ncorte das \u00e1rvores houve uma interrup\u00e7\u00e3o da transpira\u00e7\u00e3o da parte a\u00e9rea, e \n\nconsequentemente o solo foi recarregado com \u00e1gua. O teor de \u00e1gua no solo foi menor \n\nno tratamento -W em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao tratamento + W antes do corte, essa diferen\u00e7a entre \n\nos dois tratamentos persistiu um ano e meio ap\u00f3s o corte. \n\nEm primeiro lugar investigamos o impacto da redu\u00e7\u00e3o de chuvas e do corte raso das \n\n\u00e1rvores na din\u00e2mica radicular em uma planta\u00e7\u00e3o de eucalipto conduzida em talhadia. \n\nNossos resultados mostraram que as taxas di\u00e1rias de crescimento radicular foram \n\nfortemente dependentes da profundidade e da esta\u00e7\u00e3o nos tratamentos + W e -W. \n\nAp\u00f3s o corte das \u00e1rvores, o crescimento de ra\u00edzes finas come\u00e7ou nas camadas \n\nsuperiores do solo e foi crescendo ao longo do tempo em profundidade em ambos os \n\ntratamentos + W e -W. Assim, quando a planta\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 conduzida em talhadia, ap\u00f3s o \n\ncorte das \u00e1rvores, o in\u00edcio do crecimento radicular foi observado pela primeira vez 6 \n\nmeses ap\u00f3s o corte na superf\u00edcie. Na profundidade 3.5-4.8 m do solo 12 meses ap\u00f3s \n\no corte e na profundidade 13.5-14.8 m do solo 16 meses ap\u00f3s o corte, nos tratamentos \n\n+ W e -W. As taxas di\u00e1rias de crecimento alongamento das ra\u00edzes atingiram o pico no \n\nfinal da esta\u00e7\u00e3o seca para todas as camadas do solo nas profundidades > 6 m, quando \n\no teor de \u00e1gua no solo diminuiu nas camadas superficiais. Assim, os valores di\u00e1rios \n\nde alongamento das ra\u00edzes n\u00e3o foram necessariamente correlacionados com os n\u00edveis \n\nde umidade do solo para uma dada camada de solo. Observamos uma sincroniza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nentre a diminui\u00e7\u00e3o da quantidade de \u00e1gua extra\u00edvel na camada superficial e os picos \n\nde alongamento das ra\u00edzes ap\u00f3s o corte no tratamento -W. Al\u00e9m disso, vimos que a \n\ndensidade das ra\u00edzes finas reduz abaixo de 20 cm de profundidade, depois diminui \n\ngradualmente at\u00e9 o len\u00e7ol fre\u00e1tico nos tr\u00eas tratamentos NH, + W e -W. A biomassa \n\ntotal de ra\u00edzes finas em talhadia at\u00e9 17 m de profundidade foi de 1266 e 1017 g m-2 \n\nem + W e -W, respectivamente, 1.5 ano ap\u00f3s o corte raso, e 1078 g m-2 em NH 7.5 \n\nanos ap\u00f3s o plantio. A densidade de ra\u00edzes finas foi cerca de 25% maior em -W do \n\nque em + W e NH na maioria das camadas do solo. Em profundidades > 7 m, as \n\ndensidades de ra\u00edzes finas foram pelo menos duas vezes maiores em -W que em + \n\nW e NH, respectivamente. \n\nAl\u00e9m disso, est\u00e1vamos tamb\u00e9m interessados no efeito da redu\u00e7\u00e3o de chuva sobre a \n\nadapta\u00e7\u00e3o morfol\u00f3gica das ra\u00edzes finas em todo o perfil do solo. Nos tratamentos NH, \n\n+ W e -W, mostramos que a profundidade teve pouco efeito no comprimento \n\nespec\u00edfico das ra\u00edzes (SRL), na \u00e1rea espec\u00edfico das ra\u00edzes (SRA) e no di\u00e2metro das \n\n\n\n \n \n\n        \n \n\nra\u00edzes finas. SRL e SRA foram significativamente maiores em -W que em + W, e \n\nvalores semelhantes foram observados em + W e NH. At\u00e9 17 m de profundidade, os \n\nvalores m\u00e9dios de SRL foram 28.8, 30.6 e 34.4 m g-1, os valores m\u00e9dios de SRA de \n\n258.8, 267.5 e 305.3 cm2 g-1 e os di\u00e2metros m\u00e9dios das ra\u00edzes finas de 0.31, 0.32 e \n\n0.36 mm nos tratamentos NH, + W e -W, respectivamente. Durante todo o per\u00edodo de \n\nestudo (3 anos) o comprimento acumulado de ra\u00edzes mortas representou 6-7% do \n\ncomprimento total de ra\u00edzes produzido em todo o perfil do solo at\u00e9 17 m de \n\nprofundidade em ambos os tratamentos W e -W. Surpreendentemente, o comprimento \n\ndas ra\u00edzes finas mortas n\u00e3o aumentou ap\u00f3s o corte raso das \u00e1rvores e n\u00e3o diferiu \n\nentre as profundidades do solo e entre os tratamentos + W e -W. \n\nEm seguida, analisamos o impacto do corte raso das \u00e1rvores e da redu\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nprecipita\u00e7\u00e3o nas emiss\u00f5es de gases de efeito estufa, bem como sua produ\u00e7\u00e3o / \n\nconsumo em todo o perfil do solo. Os fluxos cumulativos de CO2 medidos nos \n\ntratamentos + W e -W foram 136.5 \u00b1 21.8 mol m-2 e 130.3 \u00b1 24.8 mol m-2 ano-1 no \n\n\u00faltimo ano antes do corte raso das \u00e1rvores e 108.0 \u00b1 15.8 e 119.3 \u00b1 22.5 mol m-2 ano-\n\n1 no primeiro ano ap\u00f3s o corte raso quando a planta\u00e7\u00e3o foi conduzida em talhadia. \n\nN\u00e3o encontramos diferen\u00e7as significativas entre as emiss\u00e3o de CO2, CH4 e N2O entre \n\nos dois tratamentos + W e -W. Os fluxos de CH4 foram negativos ao longo do per\u00edodo \n\nde estudo, de mar\u00e7o de 2016 a dezembro de 2017, indicando um consumo l\u00edquido de \n\nCH4 atmosf\u00e9rico pelo solo. N\u00e3o foram observadas diferen\u00e7as significativas entre os \n\ntratamentos NH e + W nas emiss\u00f5es de CO2, CH4 e N2O mostrando nenhum efeito do \n\ncorte das \u00e1rvores. \n\nOs efluxos de CO2, CH4, e N2O n\u00e3o foram significativamente diferentes entre -W e + \n\nW e n\u00e3o mudaram ap\u00f3s o corte das \u00e1rvores nas parcelas manejadas em talhadia \n\ncomparado \u00e0s parcelas sem corte raso. As concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de CO2 e CH4 aumentaram \n\nsignificativamente com a profundidade e as concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de N2O permaneceram \n\nconstantes da superf\u00edcie a uma profundidade de 15.5 m. As concentra\u00e7\u00f5es m\u00e9dias de \n\nCO2 e N2O em -W foram, respectivamente, inferior de 20.7% e 7.6% a os de +W e as \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00f5es de CH4 foram 44.4% superior em -W do que em + W sobre a totalidade \n\ndo perfil do solo. O modelo de difusividade mostrou que a produ\u00e7\u00e3o e o consumo de \n\nCO2, N2O e CH4 ocorreu em grandes profundidades e foram semelhantes nos \n\ntratamentos + W, W, e NH. O corte raso das \u00e1rvores n\u00e3o aumentou os efluxos e as \n\nprodu\u00e7\u00f5es de CO2, CH4 e N2O independentemente do regime de \u00e1gua. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nAs produ\u00e7\u00f5es de CO2, CH4, e N2O entre 0.1 e 15.5 m de profundidade, n\u00e3o foram \n\nsignificativamente diferentes entre + W e -W. As produ\u00e7\u00f5es mais elevadas de CO2 e \n\nN2O e a menor produ\u00e7\u00e3o de CH4 foram estimadas na superficie do solo devido ao \n\nforte gradiente de concentra\u00e7\u00f5es e a maior difusividade efetiva calculada na camada \n\nsuperficial do solo. A produ\u00e7\u00e3o de CO2 e N2O e o consumo de CH4 ocorreu \n\nprincipalmente na superf\u00edcie e uma parte da produ\u00e7\u00e3o de CO2 e CH4 atingiu uma \n\nprofundidade de at\u00e9 15.5 m. \n\nDiscuss\u00e3o geral \n\nA principal novidade dos nossos resultados est\u00e1 na primeira observa\u00e7\u00e3o direta da \n\nfenologia das ra\u00edzes finas, bem como nas primeiras medi\u00e7\u00f5es in situ das \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00f5es de CO2, N2O e CH4 em profundidades \u00e0 mais de 10 m em uma \n\nplanta\u00e7\u00e3o de eucalipto conduzida em talhadia. As conseq\u00fc\u00eancias do corte raso das \n\n\u00e1rvores e da redu\u00e7\u00e3o das chuvas na din\u00e2mica da produ\u00e7\u00e3o de ra\u00edzes finas e dos gases \n\nde efeito estufa em planta\u00e7\u00f5es florestais levantam quest\u00f5es espec\u00edficas que nunca \n\nforam estudadas em um perfil de solo profundo em clima tropical. \n\nEfeito da redu\u00e7\u00e3o de chuva \n\nDiante de uma seca induzida, o eucalipto aumentou a densidade de ra\u00edzes finas em \n\ngrande profundidade. O crescimento das ra\u00edzes em camadas profundas do solo pode \n\naumentar a quantidade de \u00e1gua dispon\u00edvel necess\u00e1ria para o crecimento das \u00e1rvores, \n\no que poderia ser um benef\u00edcio cr\u00edtico para as \u00e1rvores em condi\u00e7\u00f5es severas de seca \n\n(CHRISTINA et al., 2017). Ap\u00f3s o corte, observou-se um grande crescimento das \n\nra\u00edzes \u00e0 mais de 4 m de profundidade no final da temporada seca, independentemente \n\ndo tratamento. O crescimento das ra\u00edzes finas nas camadas profundas do solo \n\ncome\u00e7ou quando o teor de \u00e1gua na camada de 0-2 m caiu abaixo de um limiar de \n\ncerca de 80 mm, sugerindo que o teor de umidade no solo, em uma determinada \n\ncamada do solo, n\u00e3o foi o principal fator respons\u00e1vel pelo crescimento das ra\u00edzes \n\nfinas. Sucessivos afrouxamentos no crescimento radicular da superf\u00edcie do solo para \n\nsuas camadas mais profundas, no final da temporada seca e nos primeiros meses \n\nap\u00f3s o in\u00edcio da temporada chuvosa nos tratamentos + W e \u2013W, seria devido ao r\u00e1pido \n\nesgotamento dos recursos h\u00eddricos superficiais, o que induziria as ra\u00edzes das \u00e1rvores \n\na buscarem as camadas mais profundas do solo (BILLINGS, 2015; SCHENK E \n\nJACKSON, 2002). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n        \n \n\nAl\u00e9m disso, mostramos que os eucaliptos em condi\u00e7\u00f5es de seca adaptaram sua \n\nmorfologia radicular para maximizar a superf\u00edcie das ra\u00edzes em contato com o solo \n\npara absorver os recursos limitados. Os valores de SRL e SRA foram maiores em -W \n\nque em + W, o que combinado com maiores densidades de ra\u00edzes finas levaria \u00e0 um \n\n\u00edndice de superf\u00edcie de raiz muito maior. Nosso estudo mostrou que o eucalipto pode \n\nmodificar as caracter\u00edsticas das ra\u00edzes finas para melhorar a captura de recursos e a \n\nexplora\u00e7\u00e3o de camadas muitas profundas do solo, a fim de sua sobreviv\u00eancia em um \n\ncontexto de mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas ajudando assim, a manter a absor\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua \n\ndurante per\u00edodos secos (BRUNNER et al., 2015; CHRISTINA et al., 2017). \n\nA exclus\u00e3o da chuva n\u00e3o teve efeito nos fluxos de CO2, N2O e CH4 medidos na \n\nsuperf\u00edcie ou calculados em profundidade com um modelo de difusividade. As \n\ndiferen\u00e7as na concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de g\u00e1s no solo, medidas entre + W e -W, s\u00e3o \n\nprovavelmente devido ao maior teor de \u00e1gua do solo em + W que poderia reduzir a \n\ndifusividade dos gases, enquanto as emiss\u00f5es n\u00e3o foram afetadas. No tratamento + \n\nW, o alto teor de \u00e1gua no perfil do solo pode induzir a satura\u00e7\u00e3o do espa\u00e7o intersticial \n\npela \u00e1gua e causar uma lenta difus\u00e3o dos gases de efeito estufa para a atmosfera \n\n(MAIER et al., 2017; WANG et al., 2018). A estrutura de poros e agregados do solo \n\nest\u00e1 diretamente relacionada \u00e0 libera\u00e7\u00e3o de gases de efeito estufa, mas tamb\u00e9m ao \n\narmazenamento de carbono (MANGALASSERY et al., 2013; SMITH et al., 2004). \n\nAs produ\u00e7\u00f5es de CO2, CH4 e N2O n\u00e3o foram significativamente diferentes entre os \n\ntratamentos + W e -W at\u00e9 uma profundidade de 15.5 m. No entanto, observamos que \n\na produ\u00e7\u00e3o pode diminuir nas camadas superiores e aumentar nas camadas \n\nprofundas. N\u00f3s mostramos que a biomassa de ra\u00edzes e o \u00edndice de \u00e1rea de raiz \n\naumentaram em aproximadamente 25% e 24%, respectivamente, no tratamento de \n\nexclus\u00e3o de chuva comparado com a parcela de controle a uma profundidade de 17 \n\nm, e que a biomassa das ra\u00edzes aumentou principalmente nas profundidades > 7 m. \n\nPortanto, a mudan\u00e7a nas produ\u00e7\u00f5es de CO2 nas camadas mais profundas observadas \n\nem nosso estudo pode ser devido \u00e0 uma mudan\u00e7a nas atividades das ra\u00edzes para \n\nhorizontes mais profundos, indicando um aumento da capta\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua na \n\nprofundidade pelas ra\u00edzes (SCHWENDENMANN et al., 2010; SOTTA et al., 2007). \n\nTamb\u00e9m observamos uma mudan\u00e7a no consumo de CH4 nas camadas profundas no \n\ntratamento de exclus\u00e3o de chuva. A mudan\u00e7a no consumo de CH4 para camadas mais \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nprofundas pode ser devido \u00e0s condi\u00e7\u00f5es do solo mais favor\u00e1veis \u00e0 metanotrofia, mas \n\nmenos \u00e0 metanog\u00eanese. Mais estudos s\u00e3o necess\u00e1rios para avaliar os efeitos da \n\nexclus\u00e3o de chuva nas comunidades microbianas, suas atividades e intera\u00e7\u00f5es, e \n\nparticularmente nas camadas profundas do solo. \n\nEfeito do corte raso das \u00e1rvores \n\nDescobrimos que poucas ra\u00edzes foram perdidas pela mortalidade (<10% de todas as \n\nra\u00edzes observadas ao longo de 3 anos), sugerindo que a maior parte do sistema \n\nradicular permanece funcional ap\u00f3s o corte raso das \u00e1rvores conduzidas em talhadia. \n\nO nosso estudo sugere que \u00e1rvores de Eucalyptus grandis de 6 anos de idade t\u00eam \n\nreservas suficientes no sistema radicular e que as condi\u00e7\u00f5es apropriadas do solo para \n\nmanter a biomassa radicular estabelecida at\u00e9 o len\u00e7ol fr\u00e9atico ap\u00f3s o corte tenha, \n\nprovavelmente, tamb\u00e9m contribu\u00eddo para o crescimento inicial das rebrotas \n\n(BRUNNER et al., 2015; DRAKE et al., 2013). \n\nA assincronia no sistema radicular, atrasando o crescimento das ra\u00edzes nas camadas \n\nmais profundas do solo poderia ser uma estrat\u00e9gia para maximizar a absor\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\n\u00e1gua e nutrientes necess\u00e1rias para atender a alta demanda das \u00e1rvores de r\u00e1pido \n\ncrescimento. O crescimento das ra\u00edzes ocorreu a uma profundidade de 14 m em \n\nmenos de um ano ap\u00f3s o corte das \u00e1rvores conduzidas em talhadia, enquanto a \n\nprofundidade m\u00e1xima atingida pelas ra\u00edzes de E. grandis \u00e9 de aproximadamente 7 m \n\num ano ap\u00f3s o plantio em solos muito profundos (CHRISTINA et al., 2011; LACLAU \n\net al., 2013). As ra\u00edzes profundas permitem o acesso \u00e0 grandes quantidades de \u00e1gua \n\narmazenada no subsolo ap\u00f3s o corte e, apesar da baixa densidade de ra\u00edzes finas \n\nnas camadas mais profundas do solo, s\u00e3o suficientes para absorver grandes \n\nquantidades de \u00e1gua (CHRISTINA et al., 2017). A baixa mortalidade de ra\u00edzes finas \n\nap\u00f3s o corte sugerem que o manejo em talhadia das planta\u00e7\u00f5es de eucalipto pode ser \n\numa op\u00e7\u00e3o promissora para lidar com a seca, uma vez que o sistema de radicular \n\nexistente permite o acesso \u00e0 \u00e1gua armazenada nos horizontes profundos. \n\nContrariamente \u00e0s nossas expectativas, o corte das \u00e1rvores n\u00e3o levou ao aumento de \n\nemiss\u00f5es e produ\u00e7\u00e3o de CO2, CH4 e N2O, independentemente do regime h\u00eddrico. A \n\ncolheita de eucaliptos em planta\u00e7\u00f5es manejadas em rota\u00e7\u00f5es curtas leva a grandes \n\naltera\u00e7\u00f5es no ambiente do solo, provavelmente aumentando o processo de \n\ndecomposi\u00e7\u00e3o da mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica, como o aumento da temperatura do solo e \n\n\n\n \n \n\n        \n \n\numidade do solo, bem como ac\u00famulo de res\u00edduos de colheita na superf\u00edcie do solo \n\n(CHRISTINA et al., 2017; MENDHAM et al., 2002; O'CONNELL et al., 2004; ROCHA \n\net al., 2016). N\u00f3s mostramos que o corte das \u00e1rvores n\u00e3o levou \u00e0 um aumento da \n\nmortalidade das ra\u00edzes no primeiro ano ap\u00f3s o corte, quando a planta\u00e7\u00e3o foi conduzida \n\nem talhadia, independentemente do regime h\u00eddrico. Portanto, assumimos que o corte \n\nraso resultando em emiss\u00f5es da mesma intendisidade que antes do corte das arvores \n\nem nosso experimento pode resultar de uma diminui\u00e7\u00e3o na respira\u00e7\u00e3o das ra\u00edzes ap\u00f3s \n\na colheita, compensa-se a um aumento na decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o da mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica na \n\nsuperf\u00edcie do solo. \n\nConclus\u00e3o geral \n\nA fenologia das ra\u00edzes finas do eucalipto em talhadia submetidas \u00e0 regimes h\u00eddricos \n\ncontrastantes revelou taxas de mortalidade muito baixas. O crescimento inicial da \n\nparte a\u00e9rea ap\u00f3s o corte das \u00e1rvores beneficiou-se do sistema radicular estabelecido \n\nna rota\u00e7\u00e3o anterior, e o crescimento ass\u00edncrono das ra\u00edzes finas com a profundidade \n\nrevelou a plasticidade das \u00e1rvores em resposta \u00e0s condi\u00e7\u00f5es do solo. O \n\nestabelecimento de sistemas radiculares profundos em florestas tropicais plantadas \n\npoderia ajudar as \u00e1rvores a resistir aos longos per\u00edodos de seca esperados em muitas \n\nregi\u00f5es tropicais num contexto de mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas. \n\nAl\u00e9m disso, mostramos que o corte raso das \u00e1rvores n\u00e3o aumentou significativamente \n\nas emiss\u00f5es de CO2, N2O e CH4 quando o plantio \u00e9 conduzido em talhadia em \n\ncompara\u00e7\u00e3o com uma planta\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o cortada. As emiss\u00f5es de gases p\u00f3s-corte s\u00e3o \n\nconsistentes com as baixas taxas de mortalidade de ra\u00edzes observadas. Por outro \n\nlado, ra\u00edzes profundas tamb\u00e9m poderiam contribuir para sequestrar grandes \n\nquantidades de C no solo.

Les racines \nfines, d\u2019un diam\u00e8tre inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 2 millim\u00e8tres, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9chantillonn\u00e9es jusqu\u2019\u00e0 une \nprofondeur de 17 m sur un dispositif d\u2019exclusion de pluie comparant des peuplements \nsoumis \u00e0 une exclusion de 37% des pluies (-W) et des peuplements sans exclusion (+ \nW). La dynamique des racines a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tudi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019aide de minirhizotrons install\u00e9s dans \ndeux fosses permanentes d\u2019une profondeur de 17 m dans les traitement -W et + W, \npendant un an avant la coupe des arbres, puis pendant deux ans en taillis, et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 \n4 m de profondeur dans un peuplement non r\u00e9colt\u00e9 (NH) servant de t\u00e9moin. Les efflux \nde CO2, CH4 et N2O \u00e0 la surface du sol ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mesur\u00e9s durant trois ans dans les \ntraitements -W, + W et NH. Les concentrations en CO2, CH4 et N2O dans le sol ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \nmesur\u00e9es \u00e0 partir de fosses permanentes jusqu'\u00e0 une profondeur de 15.5 m dans les \ntraitements -W, + W et NH durant 3 mois avant la coupe des arbres et 1.5 ans apr\u00e8s \nla coupe, en taillis. \nLa croissance des racines fines \u00e9tait consid\u00e9rable \u00e0 grande profondeur (> 13 m) chez \nles arbres men\u00e9s en taillis et, \u00e9tonnamment, la mortalit\u00e9 des racines fines \u00e9tait \nextr\u00eamement faible quelle que soit la profondeur et le traitement. La biomasse totale \nde racines fines jusqu\u2019\u00e0 17 m de profondeur \u00e9tait de 1266 et 1017 g m-2 dans les \ntraitements - W et +W, respectivement, 1.5 an apr\u00e8s la coupe des arbres et de 1078 g \nm-2 dans le traitement NH, 7.5 ans apr\u00e8s la plantation. La longueur sp\u00e9cifique et la \nsurface sp\u00e9cifique des racines fines \u00e9taient environ 15% plus \u00e9lev\u00e9es dans les \npeuplements -W que dans les peuplements +W. Les \u00e9missions de CO2, CH4 et N2O \u00e0 \nla surface du sol ne diff\u00e9raient pas significativement entre -W et + W et ne changeaient \npas apr\u00e8s la coupe des arbres dans les peuplements men\u00e9s en taillis par rapport aux \npeuplements non exploit\u00e9s. Alors que les concentrations en CO2 et CH4 augmentaient \nfortement avec la profondeur, les concentrations en N2O \u00e9taient pratiquement \nconstantes de la surface du sol jusqu'\u00e0 une profondeur de 15.5 m. Les concentrations \nmoyennes en CO2 et en N2O dans les sols -W \u00e9taient respectivement inf\u00e9rieures de \n20.7% et 7.6% \u00e0 celles dans les sols +W et les concentrations en CH4 dans les sols -\nW \u00e9taient de 44.4% sup\u00e9rieures \u00e0 celles dans les sols +W. Un mod\u00e8le de diffusivit\u00e9 a \nmontr\u00e9 que les productions de CO2, N2O et CH4 \u00e9taient similaires dans les traitements \n+ W, -W et NH. La coupe des arbres n'a pas augment\u00e9 les \u00e9missions de CO2, de CH4 \net de N2O, quel que soit le r\u00e9gime hydrique. \nLa mise en place de syst\u00e8mes racinaires profonds dans les for\u00eats tropicales plant\u00e9es \npourrait permettre aux arbres de r\u00e9sister aux p\u00e9riodes de s\u00e9cheresse attendues dans \nun contexte de changement climatique. Notre \u00e9tude r\u00e9alis\u00e9e dans des peuplements \nd'eucalyptus g\u00e9r\u00e9s en taillis, repr\u00e9sentatifs de vastes zones tropicales, sugg\u00e8re que \nles \u00e9missions de gaz \u00e0 effet de serre pourraient \u00eatre peu influenc\u00e9es par les \nmodifications de r\u00e9gimes de pr\u00e9cipitations dus au changement climatique. \n \n\nMots cl\u00e9s : Br\u00e9sil. Eucalyptus grandis. croissance racinaire en profondeur. gaz \u00e0 effet \nde serre. exclusion de pluie. sol tropical tr\u00e8s profond. taillis. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nContexte \n\nLa croissance des arbres d\u00e9pend fortement de la fonction d'absorption des racines \n\nfines pour l'eau et les nutriments. Les racines fines jouent \u00e9galement un r\u00f4le important \n\ndans le cycle global du carbone (C), principalement dans les processus de production, \n\nde respiration, d'exsudation et de d\u00e9composition. Am\u00e9liorer la compr\u00e9hension de la \n\ndynamique spatio-temporelle des racines fines sur tout le profil de sol jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la nappe \n\nphr\u00e9atique est important pour identifier des pratiques sylvicoles plus durables pour les \n\nfor\u00eats plant\u00e9es.  \n\nApr\u00e8s une forte expansion au cours des 20 derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, les plantations \n\nforesti\u00e8res repr\u00e9sentent 7% de la superficie foresti\u00e8re totale du monde (KEENAN et \n\nal., 2015). Dans les r\u00e9gions tropicales et subtropicales, les plantations d'essences \u00e0 \n\ncroissance rapide stockent de grandes quantit\u00e9s de carbone et contribuent \u00e0 r\u00e9duire \n\nl'exploitation des for\u00eats naturelles en fournissant une proportion croissante de la \n\ndemande mondiale en bois (KEENAN et al., 2015). Les plantations d'eucalyptus \u00e0 \n\ncroissance rapide couvrent environ 20 millions d'hectares dans le monde (BOOTH, \n\n2013), dont environ 5.67 millions d'hectares au Br\u00e9sil (IBA, 2016). Les for\u00eats tropicales \n\nont une forte influence sur les concentrations de dioxyde de carbone (CO2), d\u2019oxyde \n\nnitreux (N2O) et de m\u00e9thane (CH4) dans l\u2019atmosph\u00e8re. Les pratiques sylvicoles dans \n\nles for\u00eats plant\u00e9es affectent les efflux de gaz \u00e0 effet de serre \u00e0 la surface du sol parce \n\nqu\u2019elles modifient les principaux facteurs qui d\u00e9terminent la production de gaz \u00e0 effet \n\nde serre dans les sols forestiers (substrat, temp\u00e9rature, teneur en eau) qui varient en \n\nfonction de la profondeur.  \n\nAu Br\u00e9sil, la plupart des plantations foresti\u00e8res sont \u00e9tablies dans des zones \u00e0 faible \n\nfertilit\u00e9 du sol et caract\u00e9ris\u00e9es par de longues p\u00e9riodes de s\u00e9cheresse. Les projections \n\nclimatiques futures pr\u00e9voient des p\u00e9riodes s\u00e8ches plus longues et plus fortes en \n\nAm\u00e9rique du Sud (SOLOMON et al., 2009). Dans ce contexte, la gestion sylvicole en \n\ntaillis des plantations d\u2019Eucalyptus peut \u00eatre un avantage contre le stress hydrique \n\nparce que les arbres b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d'un syst\u00e8me racinaire d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 et explorant \n\nles couches profondes du sol o\u00f9 l\u2019eau y est plus disponible. Les cons\u00e9quences de la \n\ncoupe des arbres sur la dynamique des racines lors de la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e de rotation \n\ndes plantations men\u00e9e en taillis posent des questions sp\u00e9cifiques jamais \u00e9tudi\u00e9es, \n\nnotamment sur les effets dans les couches profondes du sol. De plus, la r\u00e9colte des \n\n\n\n \n \n\n        \n \n\nparties a\u00e9riennes des arbres a un impact important sur le bilan de carbone et les \n\n\u00e9missions de gaz \u00e0 effet de serre de l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me. Apr\u00e8s la coupe, la mortalit\u00e9 \n\nracinaire conduit \u00e0 un apport de mati\u00e8re organique fraiche \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes profondeurs \n\n(BERHONGARAY et al., 2015). La d\u00e9composition de la mati\u00e8re organique fra\u00eeche peut \n\nfavoriser la d\u00e9gradation de la mati\u00e8re organique pr\u00e9existante (DERRIEN et al., 2014; \n\nFONTAINE et al., 2007) gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 un \"priming effect\" (KUZYAKOV et al., 2000). Le \n\n\"priming effect\" pourrait affecter le stockage de carbone par l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me et influer \n\nindirectement sur le cycle de l'azote. Peu d\u2019\u00e9tudes portent sur les cycles \n\nbiog\u00e9ochimiques dans des plantations foresti\u00e8res avec une gestion sylvicole en taillis, \n\net aucune comparant exp\u00e9rimentalement un stress hydrique (exclusion de pluie) et \n\nune pluviom\u00e9trie non perturb\u00e9e sous climat tropical. L\u2019\u00e9valuation de la contribution des \n\nracines fines profondes et de la dynamique spatio-temporelle des concentrations de \n\ngaz \u00e0 effet de serre dans les couches profondes du sol est un v\u00e9ritable d\u00e9fi \n\nm\u00e9trologique et un verrou scientifique majeur qu\u2019il est important de lever pour \u00e9tudier \n\nla durabilit\u00e9 des plantations foresti\u00e8res, ainsi que leur r\u00e9silience dans le contexte des \n\nchangements globaux. L'objectif principal de la th\u00e8se est d'\u00e9valuer l'effet de la coupe \n\net d\u2019une r\u00e9duction de pluie sur la production de racines fines, de CO2, de CH4 et de \n\nN2O le long du profil du sol jusqu'\u00e0 la nappe phr\u00e9atique. Ces effets ont \u00e9t\u00e9 suivis avant \n\net apr\u00e8s la coupe des arbres dans une plantation d\u2019Eucalyptus grandis men\u00e9e en taillis, \n\nsoumis \u00e0 deux r\u00e9gimes hydrique contrast\u00e9s.  \n\nLes objectifs sp\u00e9cifiques de la th\u00e8se sont : \n\n- D\u2019am\u00e9liorer la compr\u00e9hension de l'influence des pr\u00e9cipitations sur la production \n\net la mortalit\u00e9 des racines fines sur l'ensemble du profil de sol dans les \n\nplantations men\u00e9es en taillis ; \n\n- D\u2019\u00e9valuer l'effet de la coupe et d\u2019une gestion en taillis sur la dynamique des \n\nracines fines jusqu'\u00e0 17 m de profondeur ; \n\n- D\u2019\u00e9valuer la dynamique des racines fines, du CO2, du CH4 et du N2O pr\u00e8s de la \n\nnappe phr\u00e9atique (17 m de profondeur) soumis \u00e0 deux niveaux de pr\u00e9cipitations \n\ncontrast\u00e9s ; \n\n- D\u00e9terminer la production de CO2, de CH4 et de N2O de la surface \u00e0 une \n\nprofondeur de 17 m \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nStrat\u00e9gie de recherche \n\nLes exp\u00e9rimentations de ce doctorat se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9es au Br\u00e9sil sur la station \n\nexp\u00e9rimentale d\u2019Itatinga (Etat de S\u00e3o Paulo). Ce site exp\u00e9rimental est destin\u00e9 \u00e0 la \n\ndescription, la quantification et la mod\u00e9lisation du fonctionnement des \u00e9cosyst\u00e8mes \n\nforestier tropicaux. Les pr\u00e9cipitations annuelles moyennes sur cette zone sont de 1390 \n\nmm, la v\u00e9g\u00e9tation dominante est l\u2019eucalyptus, le sol est tr\u00e8s profond (> 15m) et de type \n\nferralitique sableux (LACLAU et al., 2010). Une plantation d\u2019Eucalyptus grandis de plus \n\nde deux hectares a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en place en 2010 sur un dispositif en parcelles divis\u00e9es \n\n(split plot) avec 3 blocs. Le facteur principal \u00e9tudi\u00e9 est la r\u00e9duction de pluie. Les travaux \n\nde th\u00e8se se sont focalis\u00e9s sur les modalit\u00e9s avec fertilisation potassique non limitante \n\ncomme dans les plantations commerciales au Br\u00e9sil, en comparant pluviom\u00e9trie non \n\nperturb\u00e9e et exclusion partielle par un syst\u00e8me de goutti\u00e8re permettant de r\u00e9colter et \n\nd\u2019exclure 37% des pluviolessivats. \n\nDeux fosses profondes de 17 m de profondeur et 1.5m de diam\u00e8tre ont \u00e9t\u00e9 creus\u00e9es \n\nd\u00e9but 2014 sur les traitements avec et sans exclusion de pluies, et \u00e9quip\u00e9es de paliers \n\nfacilitant l\u2019instrumentation et les mesures \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes profondeurs.  \n\nLes arbres ont \u00e9t\u00e9 coup\u00e9s sur le dispositif en Juin 2016 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 6 ans, et la plantation \n\na \u00e9t\u00e9 ensuite men\u00e9e en taillis. Une parcelle de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence (NH) est toutefois maintenue \n\navec les arbres en place (fertilisation et pluies non perturb\u00e9es). Sur cette parcelle une \n\ntroisi\u00e8me fosse de 3 m de profondeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 creus\u00e9e et instrument\u00e9e.  \n\nDepuis leur cr\u00e9ation en 2014, les deux fosses profondes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9quip\u00e9es de \n\nminirhizotrons pour le suivi de la dynamique racinaire (MAEGHT et al., 2013). 24 tubes \n\ntransparents de 180 cm de longueur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 install\u00e9s \u00e0 45\u00b0 depuis l\u2019int\u00e9rieur des fosses \n\npermanentes (12 par fosse) et permettent l\u2019observations des racines sur 130 cm en \n\ndessous de chaque point d\u2019installation en surface, et \u00e0 1, 3.5, 5.5, 7.5, 9 .5, 11.5, 13.5, \n\n15.5 m de profondeur. Sept tubes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 install\u00e9s dans la parcelle de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence en \n\nsurface, et \u00e0 1 et 3.5 m.   \n\nL\u2019observation des racines est r\u00e9alis\u00e9e par acquisition d\u2019images par un scanner \n\ncirculaire (CI-600 Root Growth Monitoring System, CID, USA). Huit images (21.59 cm \n\nx 19.56 cm) par tube sont prises toutes les deux semaines depuis Mai 2015 : pendant \n\n1 an avant la coupe des arbres et pendant 2 ans en taillis apr\u00e8s la coupe des arbres \n\n\n\n \n \n\n        \n \n\nen Juin 2016. Les images ont \u00e9t\u00e9 analys\u00e9es en utilisant le logiciel WinRHIZO tron \n\n(R\u00e9gent, Canada) pour tracer les racines en marquant leur longueur et leur diam\u00e8tre \n\nafin d\u2019estimer la croissance au cours du temps. \n\nLes racines fines, d\u2019un diam\u00e8tre inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 2 mm, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9chantillonn\u00e9es jusqu\u2019\u00e0 17m \n\nde profondeur afin d\u2019estimer la biomasse (racines vivantes) et la n\u00e9cromasse sur \n\nl\u2019ensemble du profil de sol \u00e0 1.5 an apr\u00e8s coupe dans les traitements +W, -W et 7.5 \n\nans apr\u00e8s la plantation dans le traitement NH.  \n\nLes \u00e9missions de gaz \u00e0 la surface du sol ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mesur\u00e9es en pla\u00e7ant une cloche \n\n(diam\u00e8tre 40 cm, hauteur 10 cm) sur une base de pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement install\u00e9e sur le site \n\nexp\u00e9rimental. Quatre chambres ont \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9es al\u00e9atoirement \u00e0 quatre distances des \n\narbres sur chaque traitement. Les chambres sont ferm\u00e9es pendant 30 min. Une \n\naliquote de l\u2019air de la chambre est collect\u00e9 avec une seringue, \u00e0 4 temps cons\u00e9cutifs \n\n(0, 10 min, 20 min et 30 min) apr\u00e8s la fermeture. Les mesures ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9 toutes \n\nles deux semaines : 3 mois avant la coupe et 1.5 ans apr\u00e8s la coupe. Des chambres \n\nde respiration du sol (9 par traitements et par blocs) ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 connect\u00e9es \u00e0 \n\nun analyseur Li-Cor 8100 (Li-cor, Lincoln, Ne, USA) permettant le suivi des \u00e9missions \n\nde CO2 \u00e0 la surface du sol, avec une mesure toutes les deux semaines. Afin de \n\ncollecter r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement les gaz du sol, les fosses ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9quip\u00e9es de micro-enceintes \n\ninstall\u00e9es aux m\u00eames profondeurs que les minirhizotrons (0.1, 0.5, 1, 3.5, 7.5, 11.5 et \n\n15.5m), et mesur\u00e9es deux fois par mois depuis 3 mois avant la coupe jusqu\u2019\u00e0 1.5 an \n\napr\u00e8s la coupe. Les concentrations en gaz sont d\u00e9termin\u00e9es par chromatographie en \n\nphase gazeuse (CPG-ECD). Un mod\u00e8le de diffusivit\u00e9 a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 partir des \n\ndonn\u00e9es pour estimer les efflux de CO2, N2O et CH4, ainsi que la production de chaque \n\ncouche de sol \u00e0 partir des concentrations mesur\u00e9es dans les fosses. \n\nPrincipaux r\u00e9sultats \n\nLe dispositif de r\u00e9duction de pluie mis en place a entrain\u00e9 une forte diminution du \n\ncontenu en eau du sol avec en moyenne une r\u00e9duction de 12.9% dans -W par rapport \n\n\u00e0 +W depuis la surface jusqu\u2019\u00e0 une profondeur de 16 m. Ce dispositif s\u2019est av\u00e9r\u00e9 \n\nefficace pour \u00e9tudier deux r\u00e9gimes de pr\u00e9cipitations contrast\u00e9s. Les sols se sont \n\nrecharg\u00e9s en eau suite \u00e0 une interruption de la transpiration de la partie a\u00e9rienne apr\u00e8s \n\nla coupe des arbres. Le contenu en eau du sol \u00e9tait inf\u00e9rieur dans le traitement -W par \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nrapport au traitement +W avant la coupe, et cette diff\u00e9rence a persist\u00e9 un an et demi \n\napr\u00e8s la coupe. \n\nDans un premier temps, nous nous sommes int\u00e9ress\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019impact de la r\u00e9duction de \n\npluie et de la coupe des arbres sur la dynamique racinaire dans une plantation \n\nd\u2019Eucalyptus men\u00e9e en taillis. Nos r\u00e9sultats ont montr\u00e9 que le taux journalier \n\nd\u2019\u00e9longation racinaire \u00e9tait fortement d\u00e9pendant de la couche de sol et de la saison \n\ndans les traitements +W et -W. En effet apr\u00e8s la coupe des arbres, la croissance des \n\nracines fines a d\u00e9but\u00e9 dans les couches superficielles du sol et s\u2019est propag\u00e9 de plus \n\nen plus en profondeur au fil du temps dans les deux traitements +W et -W.  Ainsi, apr\u00e8s \n\nla coupe des arbres le d\u00e9marrage des cohortes racinaires s\u2019est d\u2019abord observ\u00e9 6 mois \n\napr\u00e8s la coupe en superficie, 12 mois apr\u00e8s la coupe dans la couche 3.5-4.8 m de sol \n\net 16 mois apr\u00e8s la coupe dans la couche 13.5-14.8 m de sol dans les deux traitements \n\n+W et -W quand la plantation est men\u00e9e en taillis. Les valeurs du taux d\u2019\u00e9longation \n\nracinaire journalier ont culmin\u00e9es \u00e0 la fin de la saison s\u00e8che dans toutes les couches \n\nde sol \u00e0 des profondeurs sup\u00e9rieures \u00e0 6 m, lorsque le contenu en eau du sol \u00e9tait \u00e0 \n\nson minimum dans les couches superficielles. Ainsi, les valeurs d\u2019\u00e9longation racinaire \n\njournali\u00e8res n'\u00e9taient pas n\u00e9cessairement corr\u00e9l\u00e9es avec les teneurs en eau du sol \n\npour une couche de sol donn\u00e9e. Nous avons observ\u00e9 une synchronisation entre la \n\ndiminution de la quantit\u00e9 d\u2019eau extractible dans la couche superficielle et les pics \n\nd\u2019\u00e9longations racinaires apr\u00e8s la coupe dans le traitement -W. De plus nous avons \n\nobserv\u00e9s que la densit\u00e9 des racines fines chute en dessous de 20 cm de profondeur, \n\npuis diminue progressivement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la nappe phr\u00e9atique dans les trois traitements \n\nNH, +W et -W. La biomasse totale des racines fines jusqu'\u00e0 17 m de profondeur \u00e9tait \n\nde 1078 g m-2 dans NH, 1017 \u00b1 301 g m-\u00b2 dans +W et 1266 \u00b1 363 g m-\u00b2 dans -W. La \n\ndensit\u00e9 des racines fines \u00e9tait environ 25% plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e dans -W que dans +W et NH \n\ndans la plupart des couches de sol. \u00c0 des profondeurs sup\u00e9rieures \u00e0 7 m, les densit\u00e9s \n\nde racines fines \u00e9taient au moins deux fois plus \u00e9lev\u00e9es dans -W que dans + W et NH. \n\nDe plus, nous nous sommes int\u00e9ress\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019effet de la r\u00e9duction de pluie sur l\u2019adaptation \n\nmorphologique des racines fines sur tout le profil de sol. Dans les traitements NH, +W \n\net -W, nous avons montr\u00e9s que la profondeur avait peu d'effet sur la longueur \n\nsp\u00e9cifique racinaire (SRL), la surface sp\u00e9cifique racinaire (SRA) et le diam\u00e8tre des \n\nracines fines. SRL et SRA \u00e9taient significativement plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s dans -W que dans + \n\nW, et des valeurs similaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9es dans + W et NH. Sur tout le profil de sol \n\n\n\n \n \n\n        \n \n\njusqu\u2019\u00e0 17 m de profondeur, les valeurs moyennes de SRL \u00e9taient de 28.8, 30.6 et \n\n34.4 m g-1, les valeurs moyennes de SRA de 258.8, 267.5 et 305.3 cm2 g-1 et les \n\ndiam\u00e8tres moyens des racines fines de 0.31, 0.32 et 0.36 mm dans les traitements \n\nNH, +W et -W respectivement. Sur toute la p\u00e9riode d\u2019\u00e9tude (3 ans), la longueur \n\ncumul\u00e9e de racines mortes ne repr\u00e9sentait que 6-7% de la longueur cumul\u00e9e de \n\nracines produite sur tout le profil de sol jusqu\u2019\u00e0 17 m de profondeur dans les deux \n\ntraitements +W et -W. Etonnamment, la longueur des racines fines mortes n'a pas \n\naugment\u00e9 apr\u00e8s la coupe de la plantation et n'\u00e9tait pas diff\u00e9rentes entre les \n\nprofondeurs de sol et entre les traitements +W et -W. \n\nEnsuite, nous nous sommes int\u00e9ress\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019impact de la coupe des arbres et d\u2019une \n\nr\u00e9duction de pr\u00e9cipitation sur les \u00e9missions de gaz \u00e0 effet de serre ainsi que sur leur \n\nproduction/consommation sur tout le profil de sol. Les efflux cumul\u00e9s de CO2 mesur\u00e9s \n\ndans les traitements +W et -W \u00e9taient respectivement de 136. 5 \u00b1 21.8 mol m-2 et de \n\n130.3 \u00b1 24.8 mol m-2 an-1 la derni\u00e8re ann\u00e9e avant la coupe des arbres et de 108.0 \u00b1 \n\n15.8 et de 119.3 \u00b1 22.5 mol m-2 an-1 la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e apr\u00e8s la coupe quand la \n\nplantation est men\u00e9e en taillis. Nous avons observ\u00e9 aucune diff\u00e9rence significative \n\nentre les cumuls d\u2019\u00e9missions de CO2, CH4 et N2O entre les deux traitements +W et -\n\nW. Les efflux de CH4 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9gatifs pendant toute la p\u00e9riode d'\u00e9tude de mars 2016 \n\n\u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 2017, indiquant une consommation nette de CH4 atmosph\u00e9rique par le \n\nsol. Aucunes diff\u00e9rences significatives ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9s entre les \n\ntraitements NH et +W sur les \u00e9missions de CO2, CH4 et N2O, signifiant que la coupe \n\ndes arbres n\u2019a eu aucun effet.  \n\nLes efflux de CO2, de CH4 et de N2O ne diff\u00e9raient pas significativement entre -W et \n\n+W et ne changeaient pas apr\u00e8s la coupe des arbres dans les peuplements men\u00e9s en \n\ntaillis par rapport aux peuplements non exploit\u00e9s. Les concentrations de CO2 et de \n\nCH4 augmentaient fortement avec la profondeur et les concentrations de N2O restaient \n\n\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s constantes de la surface du sol jusqu'\u00e0 une profondeur de 15.5 m. Les \n\nconcentrations moyennes de CO2 et de N2O dans -W \u00e9taient respectivement \n\ninf\u00e9rieures de 20.7% et 7.6% \u00e0 celles de +W et celles de CH4 dans -W de 44.4% \n\nsup\u00e9rieures \u00e0 celles de +W sur tout le profil de sol. Un mod\u00e8le de diffusivit\u00e9 a montr\u00e9 \n\nque la production et la consommation de CO2, de N2O et de CH4 se produisaient \u00e0 de \n\ngrandes profondeurs et \u00e9taient similaires dans les traitements +W, -W et NH. La coupe \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\ndes arbres n'a pas augment\u00e9 les efflux et les productions de CO2, de CH4 et de N2O, \n\nquel que soit le r\u00e9gime hydrique. \n\nLes productions de CO2, CH4 et N2O entre 0.1 et 15.5 m de profondeur n'\u00e9taient pas \n\nsignificativement diff\u00e9rentes entre +W et -W. Les estimations de production dans le \n\npremier m\u00e8tre de sol ont montr\u00e9 les valeurs les plus \u00e9lev\u00e9es de CO2 et de N2O et les \n\nplus faibles de CH4 en raison d\u2019un fort gradient de concentration et d\u2019une diffusivit\u00e9 \n\neffective calcul\u00e9e particuli\u00e8rement \u00e9lev\u00e9e pour la couche de sol superficielle. La \n\nproduction de CO2 et de N2O et la consommation de CH4 se sont produites \n\nprincipalement dans le premier m\u00e8tre, mais au moins une partie de la production de \n\nCO2 et de CH4 a atteint une profondeur allant jusqu'\u00e0 15.5 m. \n\nDiscussion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \n\nDans cette th\u00e8se, nous avons r\u00e9alis\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois des mesures in situ de \n\nph\u00e9nologie des racines fines et de concentrations de CO2, N2O et CH4 \u00e0 des \n\nprofondeurs de plus de 10 m dans une plantation d\u2019eucalyptus men\u00e9e en taillis. Les \n\ncons\u00e9quences de la coupe des arbres ainsi qu\u2019une r\u00e9duction de pluie sur la dynamique \n\nde production des racines fines et des gaz \u00e0 effet de serre dans des plantations men\u00e9e \n\nen taillis soul\u00e8vent des questions sp\u00e9cifiques qui n\u2019ont jamais \u00e9tudi\u00e9es auparavant sur \n\nun profil de sol profond en climat tropical. \n\nEffet de la r\u00e9duction de pluie \n\nFace \u00e0 une s\u00e9cheresse induite, les Eucalyptus ont augment\u00e9 la densit\u00e9 de leurs \n\nracines fines en grande profondeur. La croissance des racines dans les couches \n\nprofondes du sol augmente l\u2019espace explor\u00e9 par les arbres, et peut donc augmenter \n\nla quantit\u00e9 d'eau disponible n\u00e9cessaire pour assurer leur croissance. Cet effet pourrait \n\nconstituer un avantage essentiel pour les arbres en cas de s\u00e9cheresse intense \n\n(CHRISTINA et al., 2017). Apr\u00e8s la coupe, une croissance racinaire spectaculaire a \n\n\u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9 \u00e0 plus de 4 m de profondeur \u00e0 la fin de la saison s\u00e8che, peu importe le \n\ntraitement. La croissance des racines fines dans les couches profondes du sol a \n\ncommenc\u00e9 lorsque la teneur en eau dans la couche de sol de 0-2 m est tomb\u00e9e en \n\ndessous d'un seuil d'environ 80 mm, ce qui sugg\u00e8re que la teneur en eau du sol dans \n\nune couche de sol particuli\u00e8re n'\u00e9tait pas le principal facteur responsable de la \n\ncroissance des racines fines. Les flushs successifs de croissance des racines de la \n\n\n\n \n \n\n        \n \n\ncouche superficielle jusqu'aux couches les plus profondes du sol \u00e0 la fin de la saison \n\ns\u00e8che et dans les premiers mois qui ont suivi le d\u00e9but de la saison des pluies dans les \n\ntraitements + W et -W seraient dus \u00e0 un \u00e9puisement rapide des ressources en eau de \n\nla couche superficielle, qui induirait les racines des arbres \u00e0 s\u2019enfoncer plus \n\nprofond\u00e9ment dans le sol (BILLINGS, 2015; SCHENK E JACKSON, 2002). \n\nDe plus nous avons montr\u00e9 que les eucalyptus confront\u00e9s \u00e0 la s\u00e9cheresse ont adapt\u00e9 \n\nleur morphologie racinaire afin de maximiser la surface racinaire en contact avec le sol \n\npour absorber les ressources limit\u00e9es. Les valeurs de SRL et SRA \u00e9taient plus \u00e9lev\u00e9es \n\ndans \u2013W par rapport \u00e0 +W, ce qui, combin\u00e9 \u00e0 des densit\u00e9s de racines fines plus \n\n\u00e9lev\u00e9es, conduirait \u00e0 un indice de surface racinaire beaucoup plus \u00e9lev\u00e9. Notre \u00e9tude \n\na montr\u00e9 que les eucalyptus peuvent modifier les traits des racines fines pour am\u00e9liorer \n\nla capture des ressources et l'exploration de couches de sol tr\u00e8s profondes afin de \n\nsurvivre dans un contexte de changement climatique en contribuant au maintien de \n\nl'absorption d'eau pendant les p\u00e9riodes s\u00e8ches (BRUNNER et al., 2015; CHRISTINA \n\net al., 2017). \n\nDe plus, l'exclusion de pluie n\u2019a eu aucun effet sur les efflux de CO2, N2O et CH4 \n\nmesur\u00e9s \u00e0 la surface ou calcul\u00e9s en profondeur avec le mod\u00e8le de diffusivit\u00e9. Les \n\ndiff\u00e9rences de concentration de gaz dans le sol, mesur\u00e9es entre +W et \u2013W proviennent \n\nprobablement de la teneur plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e en eau dans le sol en +W, ce qui pourrait par \n\nla suite r\u00e9duire la diffusivit\u00e9 des gaz du sol alors que les \u00e9missions n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \n\naffect\u00e9s. Dans le traitement +W, la teneur \u00e9lev\u00e9e en eau dans le profil de sol pourrait \n\ninduire une saturation de l'espace interstitiel par l\u2019eau et entra\u00eener une lente diffusion \n\ndes gaz \u00e0 effet de serre vers l'atmosph\u00e8re (MAIER et al., 2017; WANG et al., 2018). \n\nLa structure des pores et des agr\u00e9gats du sol est directement li\u00e9e \u00e0 la lib\u00e9ration de \n\ngaz \u00e0 effet de serre mais \u00e9galement au stockage de carbone (MANGALASSERY et \n\nal., 2013; SMITH et al., 2004). \n\nLa production de CO2, de CH4 et de N2O n'\u00e9tait pas significativement diff\u00e9rente entre \n\nles traitements +W et -W jusqu'\u00e0 une profondeur de 15.5 m. Cependant, nous avons \n\nobserv\u00e9 que la production peut diminuer dans les couches sup\u00e9rieures et augmenter \n\ndans les couches profondes. Nous avons montr\u00e9 que la biomasse racinaire ainsi que \n\nl\u2019indice de surface racinaire augmentaient d'environ 25% et 24% respectivement dans \n\nle traitement d'exclusion de pluie par rapport \u00e0 la parcelle t\u00e9moin jusqu'\u00e0 une \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nprofondeur de 17 m, et que la biomasse racinaire augmentait principalement \u00e0 des \n\nprofondeurs sup\u00e9rieures \u00e0 7 m. Par cons\u00e9quent, le d\u00e9placement de la production de \n\nCO2 vers la couche plus profonde observ\u00e9 dans notre \u00e9tude pourrait \u00eatre d\u00fb \u00e0 un \n\nd\u00e9placement de l'activit\u00e9 racinaire vers les horizons plus profond, indiquant une \n\naugmentation de l'absorption d'eau par les racines profondes (SCHWENDENMANN \n\net al., 2010; SOTTA et al., 2007). \n\nNous avons \u00e9galement observ\u00e9 un d\u00e9placement de la consommation de CH4 vers les \n\ncouches profondes du traitement d\u2019exclusion de pluie. Le d\u00e9placement de la \n\nconsommation de CH4 vers les couches plus profondes pourrait \u00eatre d\u00fb \u00e0 des \n\nconditions de sol plus favorables \u00e0 la m\u00e9thanotrophie mais d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 la \n\nm\u00e9thanog\u00e9n\u00e8se. Des \u00e9tudes compl\u00e9mentaires sont n\u00e9cessaires pour \u00e9valuer les \n\neffets de l\u2019exclusion de pluie sur les communaut\u00e9s microbiennes, leur activit\u00e9 ainsi que \n\nleurs interactions, en particulier dans les couches profondes du sol. \n\nEffet de la coupe des arbres \n\nNous avons mis en \u00e9vidence que relativement peu de racines ont \u00e9t\u00e9 perdues par \n\nmortalit\u00e9, avec moins de 10% de mortalit\u00e9 sur toutes les racines observ\u00e9es sur 3 ans, \n\nce qui sugg\u00e8re que la plus grande partie du syst\u00e8me racinaire reste fonctionnelle apr\u00e8s \n\nla coupe des arbres quand la plantation est men\u00e9e en taillis. Notre \u00e9tude sugg\u00e8re que \n\nles Eucalyptus grandis \u00e2g\u00e9s de 6 ans disposent de r\u00e9serves suffisantes dans le \n\nsyst\u00e8me racinaire pour maintenir la biomasse racinaire \u00e9tablie jusqu'\u00e0 la nappe \n\nphr\u00e9atique apr\u00e8s la coupe, ce qui a probablement contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la croissance pr\u00e9coce \n\ndes rejets (BRUNNER et al., 2015; DRAKE et al., 2013). \n\nL'asynchronisme au sein du syst\u00e8me racinaire, retardant la croissance des racines \n\ndans les couches profondes du sol, pourrait \u00eatre une strat\u00e9gie employ\u00e9e pour \n\nmaximiser l'absorption d'eau et de nutriments n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la forte \n\ndemande de ces arbres \u00e0 croissance rapide. La croissance des racines s'est produite \n\n\u00e0 une profondeur de 14 m moins d'un an apr\u00e8s la coupe des arbres quand ils sont \n\nmen\u00e9s en taillis, tandis que la profondeur maximale atteinte par les racines de E. \n\ngrandis est d'environ 7 m un an apr\u00e8s la plantation dans des sols tr\u00e8s profonds \n\n(CHRISTINA et al., 2017; LACLAU et al., 2013). Les racines profondes permettent un \n\nacc\u00e8s \u00e0 de grandes quantit\u00e9s d'eau stock\u00e9es dans le sous-sol apr\u00e8s la coupe et \n\nmalgr\u00e9 la faible densit\u00e9 de racines fines dans les couches profondes du sol, elles \n\n\n\n \n \n\n        \n \n\nsuffisent \u00e0 absorber des quantit\u00e9s importantes d'eau (CHRISTINA et al., 2017). Les \n\nfaibles taux de mortalit\u00e9 des racines fines apr\u00e8s la coupe sugg\u00e8rent que la gestion en \n\ntaillis des plantations d\u2019Eucalyptus peut \u00eatre une option prometteuse pour faire face \u00e0 \n\nla s\u00e9cheresse, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le syst\u00e8me racinaire pr\u00e9existant permet un acc\u00e8s \u00e0 \n\nl\u2019eau stock\u00e9e dans les horizons profonds. \n\nContrairement \u00e0 ce que nous esp\u00e9rions, la coupe des arbres n'a pas entra\u00een\u00e9 \n\nd'augmentation des \u00e9missions et de la production de CO2, de CH4 et de N2O, quel que \n\nsoit le r\u00e9gime hydrique. La r\u00e9colte de la biomasse a\u00e9rienne entra\u00eene une r\u00e9duction de \n\nl'absorption de carbone par la photosynth\u00e8se imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s la coupe, mais \n\n\u00e9galement des modifications substantielles de l'environnement physique du sol, telles \n\nqu'une augmentation de la temp\u00e9rature (SMETHURST E NAMBIAR, 1990) et de \n\nl'humidit\u00e9 (CORTINA E VALLEJO, 1994), qui influencent les processus de \n\nd\u00e9composition. En effet, nous avons montr\u00e9 que la coupe des arbres n'entra\u00eenait pas \n\nd'augmentation de la mortalit\u00e9 racinaire la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e apr\u00e8s la coupe lorsque la \n\nplantation \u00e9tait men\u00e9e en taillis. Par cons\u00e9quent, nous supposons que la \n\nd\u00e9composition des racines mortes ne s\u2019est pas acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9e apr\u00e8s la coupe. Nous \n\npouvons supposer que la diminution de la respiration des racines apr\u00e8s la coupe, \n\nassoci\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019augmentation de la d\u00e9composition des liti\u00e8res \u00e0 la surface du sol se \n\ncompensent, entra\u00eenant des \u00e9missions similaires \u00e0 celles d\u2019avant la coupe. \n\nConclusion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \n\nLa ph\u00e9nologie des racines fines d'eucalyptus men\u00e9e en taillis soumis \u00e0 des r\u00e9gimes \n\nhydriques contrast\u00e9s a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 des taux de mortalit\u00e9 tr\u00e8s faible. La croissance pr\u00e9coce \n\ndes pousses apr\u00e8s la coupe des arbres a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me racinaire \u00e9tabli au \n\ncours de la rotation pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, et l'asynchronisme de la croissance des racines fines \n\nen fonction de la profondeur a mis en \u00e9vidence la plasticit\u00e9 des arbres en r\u00e9ponse aux \n\nconditions du sol. La mise en place de syst\u00e8mes racinaires profonds dans les for\u00eats \n\ntropicales plant\u00e9es pourrait aider les arbres \u00e0 r\u00e9sister aux longues p\u00e9riodes de \n\ns\u00e9cheresse attendues dans de nombreuses r\u00e9gions tropicales dans un contexte de \n\nchangement climatique.  \n\nDe plus, nous avons montr\u00e9 que la coupe des arbres n\u2019entraine pas de mani\u00e8re \n\nsignificative l\u2019augmentation des \u00e9missions de CO2 et de CH4 quand la plantation est \n\nmen\u00e9e en taillis par rapport \u00e0 une plantation non exploit\u00e9e. Les \u00e9missions de gaz apr\u00e8s \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nla coupe sont coh\u00e9rentes avec les faibles taux de mortalit\u00e9 racinaire observ\u00e9s. D'autre \n\npart, les racines profondes pourraient \u00e9galement contribuer \u00e0 la s\u00e9questration de \n\ngrandes quantit\u00e9s de C dans le sol. Les allocations de carbone vers les parties \n\nsouterraines repr\u00e9sentent environ 20 \u00e0 30% de la productivit\u00e9 primaire brute dans les \n\nplantations d\u2019Eucalyptus (EPRON et al., 2012; NOUVELLON et al., 2012; RYAN et al., \n\n2010). Le C des racines est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement retenu plus longtemps dans le sol que celui \n\nde la liti\u00e8re a\u00e9rienne, qui est davantage affect\u00e9e par les processus physico-chimiques \n\net qui comporte une composition structurelle diff\u00e9rente (MENICHETTI et al., 2015; \n\nRASSE et al., 2005; SCHMIDT et al., 2011).

The research work of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel \n\non Climate Change), created in 1988, highlights the impact of climate change, mainly \n\nanthropogenic, on ecosystems (METZ et al., 2007). The Kyoto treaty was signed in \n\n1997 to fight against the increase in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse \n\ngases. The increase of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases (GHG) \n\ncontents in the atmosphere, mainly methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), and their \n\nrole in global warming are undeniable (GRAEFE et al., 2008; SOLOMON et al., 2009). \n\nReducing those emissions to avoid a temperature increase of more than 2\u00b0C above \n\npre-industrial era is a real challenge recognized by the entire scientific community \n\n(IPCC, 2014). In this perspective, the emission of greenhouse gases into the \n\natmosphere can be directly reduced (or offset) by the sequestration of carbon in some \n\ncompartments participating in its cycle. Soil represents the largest reservoir of \n\ncontinental organic carbon (JACOBSON et al., 2000). It is estimated that soil sequester \n\napproximately 800 Gt over the first 30 cm and about 1500 Gt when considering the \n\nfirst meter (BATJES, 1996; ESWARAN et al., 1993; POST et al., 1982). Therefore, a \n\ntiny variation of those stocks can have a strong effect on the global atmospheric \n\ncarbon. In this context, the French Minister of Agriculture launched the \u201c4 per 1000\u201d \n\ninitiative whose objective is to develop agronomic research in order to increase soil \n\norganic carbon stocks by 4\u2030 per year. Such an increase would make it possible to \n\noffset greenhouse gases emissions and mitigate climate change (CHABBI et al., 2017; \n\nCORBEELS et al., 2019; DIGNAC et al., 2017; LAL, 2016; MINASNY et al., 2017).  \n\nAgriculture is the first source of greenhouse gas emissions (FAO, 2015) when \n\ncombined with land-use change and forestry, which both represent approximately \n\n17.4% of worldwide GHG emissions. While many studies have been carried out to \n\nestimate the carbon balance in boreal and temperate forests (BALDOCCHI et al., \n\n2005; FALGE et al., 2002), comprehensive studies quantifying the main fluxes of the \n\nC cycle are scarce in tropical forest ecosystems. More study cases accounting for the \n\ninteractive effects of (future) climate, soil, and management practices are needed in \n\ntropical regions to improve global biogeochemical models (PENUELAS et al., 2013). \n\n\n\n52 \n \n\n \n \n\nHence, it is important to assess the feasibility, timeliness, and effectiveness of a \n\npotential use of planted forests as a strategy to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. \n\nForest plantations \n\nThe area of forest plantations has increased sharply in recent decades in response to \n\nthe increase in global demand for timber, mainly as a result of population growth, rising \n\nliving standards, and the emergence of new markets for wood products, such as the \n\nuse of wood as a substitute for fossil fuels (e.g. iron and steel industry). A study based \n\non the Global Forest Products Model (BUONGIORNO et al., 2003) predicts a 20% \n\nincrease in world demand for wood by 2060, mainly driven by the increasing \n\nconsumption of paper and wood for buildings (ELIAS E BOUCHER, 2014). While \n\nnatural forests areas decreased from 3961 million hectares in 1990 to 3721 million \n\nhectares in 2015, forest plantation areas increased from 168 to 278 million hectares \n\nduring the same period (KEENAN et al., 2015; PAYN et al., 2015). Thus, forest \n\nplantations account for 7% of the total of forest area in the world in 2015, compared to \n\n4.1% in 1990. In 2000, they accounted for 5% of the global forest cover but provided \n\n33% of roundwood harvested and reached 46% in 2012, with large disparities between \n\nregions in the world: 65% in tropical and subtropical regions, 45% in temperate regions \n\nand only 14% in boreal regions. In tropical and subtropical regions, plantations of fast-\n\ngrowing species (mainly Eucalyptus, Pinus and Acacia genera) store large amounts of \n\ncarbon and contribute to reducing the exploitation of natural forests by providing an \n\nincreasing proportion of the global demand of wood (KEENAN et al., 2015), and \n\naccounted for 29% of global forest plantation areas (PAYN et al., 2015). Highest \n\nproductivities are reached in tropical and subtropical regions. Plantation productivity is \n\non average 4.6 m3 ha-1 year-1 and greatly vary around the world from 1.4 m3 ha-1 year-\n\n1 on average in boreal regions to 8.4 m3 ha-1 year-1 in tropical regions (PAYN et al., \n\n2015). South America with an average productivity of 24 m3 ha-1 year-1 is the area with \n\nthe highest productivity. Indeed, in 2012, Brazil\u2019s forest plantations, despite an area of \n\nonly 7.7 million hectares, produced 132 million m3, as much as the United States with \n\nan area of 79 million hectares that produced 141 million m3. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n53 \n \n\n        \n \n\nEucalyptus plantations \n\nFast-growing Eucalyptus plantations cover about 20 million hectares throughout the \n\nworld (BOOTH, 2013) and are the most planted tree species in Brazil with about 5.6 \n\nmillion hectares, which represents 72.3% of the area of Brazilian forest plantations and \n\n81% of the Brazilian wood production (IBA, 2016). Eucalyptus plantations play an \n\nimportant role in the supply of pulp, paper and power generation in Brazil, accounting \n\nfor 5% of the country's GDP, in addition to 2.4 million direct and indirect jobs (IBA, \n\n2016). These forests of great economic interest have a mean annual increment of 40 \n\nm3 ha-1 year-1 on rotations of 6-8 years, ranging between 25 and 60 m3 ha-1 year-1 \n\ndepending on forest management practices and regions (OLIVEIRA et al., 1999). With \n\na gross primary productivity that can exceed 3500 g C m-2 year-1 (NOUVELLON et al., \n\n2012; RYAN et al., 2010), Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil are among the most \n\nproductive forests in the world (LUYSSAERT et al., 2007). The significant productivity \n\ngains over the last 25 years, from 25 m3 ha-1 year-1 in the early 1990s to more than 40 \n\nm3 ha-1 year-1 nowadays, resulted from improvements in silvicultural practices and \n\nbreeding programs making it possible to identify highly performant clones from some \n\nEucalyptus species and hybrids, in particular E. grandis, E. urophylla, E. saligna and \n\nE. camaldulensis. The diversity of Eucalyptus species planted in tropical regions has \n\nled to a wide range of products and management practices (GON\u00c7ALVES et al., 2013). \n\nAlthough many Eucalyptus plantations are intensively managed to produce raw \n\nmaterials for industry (mainly pulp and paper, but also solid-wood products, fiberboards \n\nand charcoal for steel production), energy production from wood for domestic use also \n\ncontributes to alleviating poverty in developing countries (COSSALTER E PYE-SMITH, \n\n2003; NAMBIAR E HARWOOD, 2014). The development of industries that use wood \n\nas raw materials has generated more attention from researchers to develop new \n\ntechniques oriented towards the increase of productivity and wood quality. Highly \n\nproductive industrial plantations are generally perceived as a threat to biodiversity, \n\nwater resources or soil fertility. The environmental impact of those highly productive \n\nforest plantations has raised many concerns in recent decades (COSSALTER E PYE-\n\nSMITH, 2003). Nevertheless, the problems associated with these plantations are often \n\nsite-specific, and how they are managed is of paramount importance. \n\n \n\n\n\n54 \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1 - Eucalyptus plantation located in the southeastern region of Brazil, in \nS\u00e3o Paulo state.  \n\n \n\n \n\nConsequences of climate change on the forest plantations management \n\nIn Brazil, most of Eucalyptus plantations are settled in areas with very deep soils (> \n\n5m), low soil fertility and prolonged drought periods (GON\u00c7ALVES et al., 2013). Even \n\nif future precipitation distributions are still difficult to predict at the local scale, studies \n\nhave shown that global warming will be associated with an intensification of dry periods \n\nin many parts of the globe (Figure 2)(SOLOMON et al., 2009), especially in sub-tropical \n\nareas already subject to severe droughts (MEEHL et al., 2007). A throughfall exclusion \n\nexperiment in the Amazon showed that a decrease in precipitation can have a \n\nconsiderable influence on the functioning of forest ecosystems (BRANDO et al., 2008). \n\nThe dynamics of fine roots, litter fall, soil organic matter decomposition and nutrient \n\nmineralization, as well as soil aeration (affecting the diffusion of gases and microbial \n\nprocesses in the soil) are highly sensitive to rainfall (MAIER et al., 2017; VAN \n\nSTRAATEN et al., 2010). In this context, it is important to better understand the factors \n\n\n\n55 \n \n\n        \n \n\ninfluencing the response of forest ecosystems and their ability to improve their \n\nadaptation to drought conditions (CHOAT et al., 2012). \n\nIn tropical and subtropical regions, the productivity of intensively-managed Eucalyptus \n\nplantations is mainly controlled by water availability in the soil (GON\u00c7ALVES et al., \n\n2013; SMETHURST, 2010). The management of fast-growing Eucalyptus plantations \n\nshould be adapted in the future to more frequent drought conditions to avoid tree \n\nmortality (BATTIE?LACLAU, LACLAU, DOMEC, et al., 2014; WHITE et al., 2009; \n\nWHITE et al., 2014). The selection of drought-tolerant clones and hybrids will be \n\nnecessary to reduce tree water requirements, as well as a possible adjustment in \n\nplanting density, fertilization regime and rotation duration (BOOTH, 2013). \n\nFigure 2 - Average forecasts of changes in global rainfall distribution. Rainfall \nvariations are expressed as a percentage change in precipitation per degree of \nwarming. Predictions are made for decadal precipitation variations from 1900-1950 \nas the reference period (SOLOMON et al., 2009). \n\n  \n\n\n\n56 \n \n\n \n \n\nFurthermore, the main criticism of industrial Eucalyptus plantations is their high-water \n\nconsumption, which can affect the water resources of the regions concerned by large \n\nareas of afforestation (JACKSON et al., 2005). Soil moisture monitoring down to a \n\ndepth of 10 m in Brazilian eucalypt plantations showed no drainage beyond the root \n\nsystem, from the third year after planting onward, even though the annual \n\nprecipitations was relatively high (about 1400 mm year-1) (CHRISTINA et al., 2011; \n\nLACLAU et al., 2013). Silvicultural management also has a significant impact on the \n\nwater cycle. The clear-cut of the trees allows a recharge of the deep horizons of the \n\nsoil with a rise of several meters of the water table (ALMEIDA et al., 2007; CHRISTINA \n\net al., 2017). Improving our understanding of soil water transfers after cutting the trees \n\nand their impact on the microbial processes involved in C and nutrient cycling is \n\nimportant for the management of these planted forests in a context of climate change \n\n(IPCC, 2014; SHEFFIELD E WOOD, 2008; SOLOMON et al., 2009). \n\nThe importance of fine roots for tree growth \n\nBeing the main organ for water and nutrient uptake by plants, fine roots (diameter ? 2 \n\nmm) play an essential role in plant growth (BRUNNER et al., 2013; HINSINGER, 2001; \n\nUPSON E BURGESS, 2013). The establishment of a deep root system can be a \n\nstrategy for plant species to adapt to water stress. In poor soils, most of the fertility is \n\nconcentrated in the surface horizon as a result of deposition and decomposition of \n\naboveground litter, soil organic matter mineralization and fine root decomposition. The \n\nhigh root growth rate of Eucalyptus trees allows them to explore both the superficial \n\nsoil layers and very deep soil horizons at early stages. Fine roots in eucalypt \n\nplantations can reach a depth of 7 m the first year after planting when there is no barrier \n\nfor root growth (CHRISTINA et al., 2011; LACLAU et al., 2013). However, the relative \n\ncontribution of deep roots to mineral nutrition is still poorly documented in these \n\nplantations (BORDRON et al., 2018; DA SILVA et al., 2011). \n\nPlant species use a large range of rooting patterns to cope with periodic drought, from \n\n\u201cdrought tolerant strategies\u201d with fine roots surviving in periodically dry soil, to \u201cdrought \n\navoiding strategies\u201d shedding fine roots from dry soil horizons while rapidly developing \n\nroots in moister areas (BRISTIEL et al., 2018; BRUNNER et al., 2015; VRIES et al., \n\n2016). Drought can increase the root-to-shoot ratio, the root area or root length-to-leaf \n\narea ratio, as well as the proportion of fine roots in deep soil layers and/or the specific \n\n\n\n57 \n \n\n        \n \n\nroot area (MA et al., 2018; MARKESTEIJN E POORTER, 2009; ZHOU et al., 2018). \n\nRoot growth peaks have been shown in deep soil layers during or the first months just \n\nafter dry periods for eucalypt and rubber trees in tropical soils (LAMBAIS et al., 2017; \n\nMAEGHT et al., 2015). Drought tolerance strategies are common for herbaceous \n\nplants, while drought avoiding strategies are often adopted by trees in evergreen \n\ntropical forests (BRUNNER et al., 2015). Despite the crucial role of fine roots to cope \n\nwith drought, root phenology remains poorly understood in comparison to leaf \n\necophysiology (RADVILLE et al., 2016). \n\nFine root dynamics and turnover depend on the plant species, but also on biotic and \n\nabiotic parameters. For example, soil water contents and soil properties, such as pH, \n\nnitrogen and oxygen concentrations can strongly influence fine root dynamics (GUO et \n\nal., 2008; SATOMURA et al., 2007; VOGT et al., 1995). Indeed, observations in \n\nEucalyptus plantations suggest a link between the vertical distribution of fine roots and \n\nnutrient acquisition by the trees (BOUILLET et al., 2002; DA SILVA et al., 2011; \n\nLACLAU et al., 2013), which can itself develop a high plasticity of its root system to \n\ncolonize preferentially nutrient-rich areas (HODGE, 2004). \n\nHow to study fine root dynamics \n\nThere is no consensus on the best method to measure fine root production in forest \n\necosystems, and most studies conclude that a combination of different methods gives \n\nthe most reliable results (HENDRICKS et al., 2006; HERTEL E LEUSCHNER, 2002; \n\nJOURDAN et al., 2008; VOGT et al., 1995). Successive soil sampling with a sequential \n\ncoring measurement is the most commonly used method to study fine root production \n\nin natural or planted forest ecosystems (JOURDAN et al., 2008; MELLO et al., 2007; \n\nPERSSON, 1978). It is frequently associated with the installation of \u201cingrowth cores\u201d, \n\nboth techniques are based on destructive soil samplings. In the last method, new fine \n\nroots produced in a root-free soil volume are regularly collected and quantified within \n\nmesh bags every month or more, during an entire year, to estimate the annual fine root \n\nproduction (HENDRICKS et al., 2006). However, several studies have shown that soil \n\ndisturbances (in particular fine root cutting) that occurred during the installation of the \n\nmesh bags significantly changes fine root dynamics (HERTEL E LEUSCHNER, 2002; \n\nJOURDAN et al., 2008; VOGT et al., 1998). Since the 1980s, the minirhizotron \n\ntechnique is widely used to study fine root dynamics and turnover (GRAEFE et al., \n\n\n\n58 \n \n\n \n \n\n2008; MAEGHT et al., 2013; WITHINGTON et al., 2003). This technique allows direct \n\nobservation and measurement of fine root dynamics while minimizing soil disturbance \n\nif a long period of recovery is observed prior to root measurements. It is a non-\n\ndestructive method that involves the installation of transparent tubes, called \n\nminirhizotrons, in the soil near the studied plants (MAJDI et al., 2001; TIERNEY E \n\nFAHEY, 2001; WITHINGTON et al., 2003). With this transparent interface, fine roots \n\ncan be measured at successive dates to study the dynamics of growth and mortality \n\n(ANDERSON et al., 2003; HENDRICK E PREGITZER, 1996). The opportunity to study \n\nfine roots in a mildly disturbed environment is an important asset of this method (MAJDI \n\net al., 2001). \n\nSpecificities of fine roots in deep soil layers \n\nDeep fine roots are fundamental organs for the growth and survival of plants. They \n\nhelp to avoid nutrient losses through deep drainage (LACLAU et al., 2010; \n\nMARESCHAL et al., 2013), and to withdraw water at great depth during dry periods \n\n(BATTIE?LACLAU, LACLAU, DOMEC, et al., 2014; CHRISTINA et al., 2015; \n\nSCHWENDENMANN et al., 2010). Fine root dynamics at the vicinity of very deep water \n\ntables have been little studied (SOYLU et al., 2014), mainly due to technical difficulties, \n\nalthough the fine root behavior can be essential for plant survival during severe drought \n\nevents (IVANOV et al., 2012; MALHI et al., 2009; MARKEWITZ et al., 2010; NEPSTAD \n\net al., 2007). Fine root lifespan depends on many factors such as root order (GUO et \n\nal., 2008), diameter (JOSLIN et al., 2006) and soil depth (BADDELEY E WATSON, \n\n2005; GERMON et al., 2016; HENDRICK E PREGITZER, 1996). Most of the studies \n\ndealing with fine root production and turnover have been carried out in the upper soil \n\nlayers (depth&lt;1 m) mainly due to the difficulty to realize such measurements at great \n\ndepth (BILLINGS, 2015). Improving our understanding of water and nutrient uptake \n\nprocesses at great depth will become more important for forest management in a \n\ncontext of climate change (MALHI et al., 2009; NEPSTAD et al., 1994). \n\nStudies carried out in Brazil showed that about 10% of the total fine root biomass is \n\ndistributed below 3 m of depth in eucalypt plantations (CHRISTINA et al., 2011). \n\nLACLAU et al. (2013) showed that the proportion of fine roots below 4 m deep \n\nincreased with the age of Eucalyptus trees: fine roots below 4 m deep represented 5%, \n\n10% and 20% of the fine root intersects on vertical pit walls in plantations of 1, 3.5 and \n\n\n\n59 \n \n\n        \n \n\n6 years old, respectively. In Brazil, the first estimates of the production and turnover of \n\nEucalyptus fine roots were conducted in topsoil horizons limited to a depth of 1 m \n\n(JOURDAN et al., 2008; MELLO et al., 2007), while little is known about these \n\nprocesses at depth. LAMBAIS et al. (2017) studied root production and mortality during \n\nthe first rotation of Eucalyptus plantation down to a depth of 6 m. They showed that \n\nEucalyptus fine roots colonized quickly the very deep soil horizons (depth > 5 m) and \n\nthat the root elongation rate was higher between the depths of 5 and 6 m compared to \n\nthe top soil from 2 to 4 years after planting. In addition, there was only 3.4% of root \n\nlength lost by mortality in the 5-6 m soil layer during the 2 years of study, whereas \n\n22.7% of the fine roots had died in the superficial layer. There is little quantitative data \n\non deep fine root dynamics (> 6 m) and literature tends to underestimate the depth of \n\nthe root system distribution as well as its importance in ecosystems functioning and \n\nproductivity (FREYCON et al., 2015; MARKEWITZ et al., 2010; SCHENK E JACKSON, \n\n2002). \n\nRelationships between fine root dynamics and GHG fluxes  \n\nFine roots participate actively in the C fluxes in forest soils through the emission of C \n\nto atmosphere by respiratory processes and C storage in the soil from root mortality \n\nand exudation of carbonic compounds (BALESDENT E BALABANE, 1996; STRAND \n\net al., 2008). Then, it is challenging to compare the observations of fine root production \n\nand mortality with the dynamics of CO2, CH4 and N2O throughout deep soil profiles in \n\nthe context of climate change. Eucalyptus trees allocate about 30% of their gross \n\nprimary productivity to root maintenance and production in highly productive \n\nplantations managed in short rotations (RYAN et al., 2010), but the difficulty to estimate \n\nfine root dynamics throughout the entire soil profile limits the estimation of the global \n\nsoil carbon cycle and the total emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), as well as the \n\nunderstanding of factors controlling them (WANG et al., 2013).  \n\nGreenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from soils are the result of complex production, \n\nconsumption and transport processes (Figure 3), and are affected by many factors \n\nsuch as microclimate, substrate availability for soil micro-organisms, aboveground \n\nphotosynthetic supply to roots and management factors (METAY et al., 2007). CO2 \n\neffluxes at soil surface come from root respiration, anaerobic and aerobic microbial \n\nrespiration and soil organic matter decomposition (Figure 3) (OERTEL et al., 2016; \n\n\n\n60 \n \n\n \n \n\nVERSINI et al., 2013). CH4 effluxes depend on the balance between production by \n\nmethanogenesis under anaerobic conditions and consumption by methanotrophic \n\nmicroorganisms (DUTAUR E VERCHOT, 2007; TATE, 2015) (Figure 3). N2O \n\nemissions from soil are driven by microbial nitrification (oxidation of NH4+ to NO3-) \n\nand denitrification (reduction of NO3- to N2O) (Figure 3) (BAI et al., 2014; ORTIZ-\n\nGONZALO et al., 2018; ZHONG et al., 2014).  \n\nProduction of greenhouse gases by soil microorganisms and roots can change rapidly \n\ntemporally and spatially, which makes modeling efforts challenging (COURTOIS et al., \n\n2018; DREWITT et al., 2005). While most studies dealing with soil greenhouse gas \n\neffluxes addressed the spatial and temporal variations, the vertical distribution of soil \n\nrespiration is still little documented in very deep soils (DREWITT et al., 2005). Trees \n\nwith roots at depths of more than 10 m are common in tropical forests (BROEDEL et \n\nal., 2017; NEPSTAD et al., 1994; SALESKA et al., 2007). In a Brazilian Amazon forest, \n\nthe consumption of CH4 occurred mainly in the upper 10 cm of the soil profile, the \n\nproduction of N2O mainly in the 0-25 cm soil layer whereas CO2 was produced down \n\nto at least a soil depth of 11 m (DAVIDSON et al., 2004). In another Amazonian forest, \n\nCO2 production in the 0.5-3 m soil layer accounted for 17 % of the total soil CO2 \n\nproduction (SOTTA et al., 2007). Even if microbial activity is low in deep soil layers \n\n(FONTAINE et al., 2007), the huge soil volume explored by fine roots might lead to \n\nsignificant CO2, N2O and CH4 productions within the entire rooting soil profile.  \n\nMeasurements of GHG emissions at the soil surface provide an integrative estimate of \n\nthe net production in the soil, but information on the patterns of production, \n\nconsumption and transport of CO2, CH4 and N2O within the soil profile remain poorly \n\nunderstood (DAVIDSON et al., 2006; HASHIMOTO et al., 2007; WIAUX et al., 2015). \n\nUnderstanding these patterns can provide insights into the possibilities of reducing \n\nGHG emissions. Data on the time course of GHG concentrations throughout soil \n\nprofiles can provide additional information on heterogeneous gaseous exchange \n\nprocesses at depth that may be involved in the control of such surface fluxes. The \n\ncomparison between the dynamics of CO2 contents at various depths and the \n\ndynamics of production and mortality of fine roots throughout the soil profile observed \n\nwith minirhizotrons could help us to better estimate and characterize the origin of the \n\norganic C emitted at the soil surface.\n\n\n\n61 \n \n\n        \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3 - Schematic representation of belowground production, consumption and transport processes for Eucalyptus \nplantations.\n\n\n\n62 \n \n\n \n \n\nRoot dynamics in forest stands conducted in coppice \n\nCoppice management could be an interesting option to face water deficit because the \n\ntrees are likely to benefit from a root system already established preserving living \n\nbiomass for the next generation and making it possible to access the deep soil layers \n\nwhere water availability can be higher than in the topsoil. Coppice-managed \n\nplantations, letting regenerate one or two shoots from the stump after the harvest, are \n\ncommon due to lower production costs, shorter cycle times and faster financial returns \n\ncompared to replanting (GON\u00c7ALVES et al., 2014). The proportion of coppice-\n\nmanaged plantations has increased from 10 % of the total area of Eucalyptus \n\nplantations in 2008 to 25-35% in 2010. The effects of clear-cutting on fine root \n\ndynamics in coppiced-managed forest plantations are poorly documented and the \n\ntrends are not clear. Sequential coring in Brazilian eucalypt plantations conducted in \n\ncoppice showed that fine root density decreased in the 0-1 m soil layer the first 60 days \n\nafter harvesting while fine root decomposition was accelerated (MELLO et al., 2007). \n\nLess intense root growth was observed in the first 10 cm of the soil at 90 days after \n\ncutting the trees. In addition, this study showed that the decomposition of fine roots \n\nwas accelerated after the clear-cut (MELLO et al., 2007). An earlier study suggested \n\nthat the growth of fine roots continues during the period after the harvest of trees in \n\ncoppice-managed plantations of E. camaldulensis Dehn in Morocco; however, radial \n\nroot growth was interrupted after cutting the trees (RIEDACKER, 1973). The most \n\ncomplete studies on root dynamics after regrowth have been carried out in coppice-\n\nmanaged Populus plantations. DICKMANN et al. (1996) observed little changes in fine \n\nroot production and mortality after clear-cutting down to a depth of 1 m. \n\nBERHONGARAY et al. (2015) showed that before cutting the trees, the mortality of \n\nfine roots was much lower than the production, while after the harvest, mortality \n\nexceeded the root production. However, these results were obtained only in the upper \n\n80 cm of the soil, while studies carried out in eucalypt plantations in the state of S\u00e3o \n\nPaulo showed that approximately 50% of the roots of diameter&lt;1 mm were located \n\nbelow 1 m (LACLAU et al., 2013). Cutting the trees leads to a significant production of \n\norganic matter via necromass and carbon compound exudates and therefore could be \n\nconsiderable at great depth (BERHONGARAY et al., 2015; WERNER E SCHNYDER, \n\n2012) due to the amount of fine roots produced in these soil depths (LACLAU et al., \n\n2013). \n\n\n\n63 \n \n\n        \n \n\nRoot inputs and changes in soil organic matter dynamics in coppice-managed \n\nstands \n\nCoppice management may influence carbon sequestration in the superficial soil layers \n\nin Eucalyptus plantations, but also in very deep soil horizons where the influence of \n\nfresh organic matter inputs on carbon storage is still poorly understood (DERRIEN et \n\nal., 2014; FONTAINE et al., 2007). Removing the aboveground parts of trees can have \n\na great impact on the ecosystem carbon balance and greenhouses gases emissions. \n\nClear-cutting increases the solar radiation transmitted to the soil, raising the soil \n\ntemperature and soil water contents through an interruption of stand transpiration \n\n(LONDO et al., 1999; MELLO et al., 2007). This may induce an increase in microbial \n\nactivity, the decomposition of harvest residues left at the soil surface and enhance fine \n\nroot mortality and decomposition (MELLO et al., 2007; PARFITT et al., 2001). When \n\ndecomposed, a part of the former tissues from the roots is incorporated into the soil \n\norganic matter (STRAND et al., 2008). Microorganisms are reactivated in response of \n\nthe input of fresh organic matter. Specialized microorganisms develop rapidly and \n\nbreak down fresh organic matter. Their metabolites can activate a second class of \n\nspecialized microorganisms, in dormancy, which can degrade the organic matter \n\ninitially present and stored in the soil: this is the \"priming effect\" (FONTAINE et al., \n\n2003). KUZYAKOV et al. (2000) emphasizes the importance of characterizing \n\nmicrobial communities, their biomass but also their functioning (e.g. catabolic profile or \n\nenzymatic activity), and their structure (e.g. bacteria / fungi ratio) as a prerequisite for \n\nthe evaluation of the underlying mechanisms. The consumption of soil organic matter \n\nby microbes results in the emission of CO2 in aerobic conditions and CH4 in anaerobic \n\nconditions. The \u201cpriming effect\u201d could affect carbon storage in the soil and indirectly \n\ninfluence the nitrogen cycle. Indeed, CO2 emissions in the soil profile influence the \n\noxygen partial pressure, which is one of the factors controlling the transformation \n\nreactions of nitrogen substrates in the soil. Furthermore, the availability of carbon \n\nsubstrates is one of the main regulatory factors of the denitrification reaction \n\n(GROFFMAN, 1991). Diffusion and transport of gases are inversely proportional to the \n\nwater-filled pore space (WFPS%). Therefore, when the soil water content decreases, \n\nCO2, CH4 and N2O reaches the surface quickly, the oxygen diffuses better throughout \n\nthe soil profile, which influences important production and consumption processes \n\n(CLOUGH et al., 2005; HEINCKE E KAUPENJOHANN, 1999). Most of the studies \n\n\n\n64 \n \n\n \n \n\ndealing with soil carbon storage and greenhouse gas concentrations are limited to the \n\nupper meter of the soil profile (HARPER E TIBBETT, 2013). The consequences of tree \n\nharvesting on root dynamics and greenhouse gases production and consumption over \n\nthe first year of the rotation in coppice-managed plantations ask specific questions \n\nnever studied within the entire rooting profile in deep tropical soils. \n\nA literature review pointed out the importance of fine roots in deep soil layers for the \n\ngrowth and survival of plants and their ability to adapt to biotic and abiotic stresses. \n\nThe foraging strategy adopted by root systems is influenced by water availability, so \n\nplants tend to develop deeper root systems when they are subject to water stress \n\n(BRISTIEL et al., 2018; CHRISTINA et al., 2011). Coppice management could be an \n\ninteresting option to face water deficit because the trees are likely to benefit from a \n\ndeep root system already established before harvesting the previous stand to produce \n\nnew shoots. Despite recent insights highlighting the importance of fine roots at great \n\ndepth, current knowledge of their dynamics is still extremely limited. Furthermore, root \n\nmortality supply organic matter at different soil depths, which is likely to affect \n\ngreenhouse gas production and consumption processes. Therefore, improving our \n\nunderstanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of GHG concentrations throughout \n\ndeep soil profiles is an important issue to assess the environmental impact of \n\nsilvicultural practices in tropical planted forests in a context of climate change. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n65 \n \n\n        \n \n\nResearch question and specific objectives \n\nThe evaluation of the contribution of deep fine roots to the spatiotemporal dynamics of \n\nGHG concentrations throughout deep soil profiles is a metrological challenge and, in \n\nfact, a major scientific lock. The general objective of the thesis is to gain insight into \n\nfine root production and mortality in deep soil profiles with a joint characterization of \n\ngreenhouse gases consumption and production. These effects have been monitored \n\nbefore and after harvesting all the trees in a highly productive Eucalyptus grandis \n\nplantation managed in coppice after clear-cutting, under two contrasting water supply \n\nregimes in S\u00e3o Paulo state, Brazil.  \n\nThe specific objectives of the thesis are: \n\n- To gain insight into the influence of rainfall reduction on fine root production and \n\nmortality throughout the soil profile in coppice-managed plantations; \n\n- To assess the effect of clear-cutting and coppice management on fine roots \n\ndynamics down to the water table, here located at a depth of 17 m;  \n\n- To determine the vertical profile of CO2, CH4, and N2O production rates from the \n\ntopsoil to a depth of 17 m under two contrasting rainfall regimes. \n\nThe results obtained in this thesis are presented as three scientific articles and the \n\norganization of the different parts are summarized in Figure 4: \n\n?

Hill ex Maiden located in the southeastern region of Brazil, in S\u00e3o Paulo state. Very \n\nsimplified forest ecosystems such as monoclonal plantations offer interesting \n\nopportunities to understand more precisely some ecophysiological and \n\nbiogeochemical processes impacting carbon and nutrient cycling. The studied field trial \n\nis particularly of interest to answer our questions because Eucalyptus trees exhibit a \n\nremarkable deep root system in homogeneous tropical soils, and they have the \n\ncapability to be coppice managed.  \n\nCharacteristics of the experimental area  \n\nThe work presented in this thesis was performed between 2015 and 2017 in Brazil at \n\nthe Itatinga Forest Science Experimental Station owned by the Agricultural Superior \n\nSchool of Luiz de Quieroz (ESALQ) of S\u00e3o Paulo State University (USP). This \n\nexperimental station, of an area of 2120 hectares, is located on the western plateau of \n\nS\u00e3o Paulo (23\u00b002\u2019S 48\u00b038\u2019W) at 300 km from the sea. This experimental site was \n\nheavily instrumented to quantify the dynamics of C, water and nutrient fluxes and to \n\nmodel the functioning of highly productive eucalypt plantations. \n\nThe climate of this region was humid subtropical with a dry winter (Cwa) according to \n\nthe K\u00f6ppen classification. Over the 15 years prior to this study, the mean annual rainfall \n\nwas 1390 mm, the mean air temperature was 20\u00b0C and the mean relative humidity \n\nwas 77%. Two seasons can be distinguished, a dry and cold season from June to \n\nSeptember with a mean monthly temperature of 15\u00b0C, and a wet and hot season from \n\nOctober to May, with a mean monthly temperature of 25\u00b0C and heavy rainfalls (about \n\n75% of the total annual rainfall). \n\nThe experiment was located on the upper part of a hill (slope&lt;3%) at an altitude of \n\n850 m. From 1945 to 1998, the area was planted with Eucalyptus saligna and since \n\n1998 wooded with a highly productive plantation of Eucalyptus grandis W. Hill ex \n\nMaiden. E. grandis are native from the east coast of Australia, between latitudes 33\u00b0S \n\n(New South Wales) and 16\u00b0S (northern Queensland), in areas where precipitations are \n\ngreater than 1000 m. In Brazil, the Eucalyptus grandis species is widely used due to \n\n\n\n68 \n \n\n \n \n\nthe high quality of pulpwood, rapid growth and high productivity, and its suitability for \n\ncoppice-management. \n\nThe soils were very deep (> 15 m) Ferralsols (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015) \n\ndeveloped on Cretaceous sandstone of medium texture. Clay contents were ranging \n\nfrom 160 mg g-1 in the topsoil to about 250 mg g-1 at a depth of 15 m. Soil mineralogy \n\nis dominated by quartz, kaolinite and oxyhydroxides.

A split-plot experimental design was set up in June \n\n2010 with a Eucalyptus grandis clone used in commercial plantation by the Suzano \n\nCompany (S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil), to evaluate the impact of rainfall reduction and \n\ncontrasting fertilizations on the productivity and adaptability of Eucalyptus plantations. \n\nThe experimental layout contained six treatments (three types of nutrient supply x two \n\nwater regimes) replicated in three blocks. The whole-plot factor was the water supply \n\nregime (\u2018\u2018exclusion\u201d plots, -W, vs \u2018\u2018non-exclusion\u201d plots, +W) and the split-plot factor \n\nwas the fertilization regime. In this thesis, we studied two treatments out of all those \n\navailable in the experimental design: one treatment with undisturbed rainfall (+W) and \n\n\n\n69 \n \n\n        \n \n\none treatment with throughfall exclusion (-W). Treatments -W and +W were used to \n\ndetermine the water deficit effect. \n\nThe individual plots area was about 864 m2. Trees were planted in June 2010 at a \n\nspacing of 3 m x 2 m with a stocking density of 1666 trees per hectare, e.g. 144 trees \n\nper plot totalizing 432 trees per treatment per 3 blocks. All the plots were fertilized at \n\nplanting with 3.3 g P m-2, 200 g m-2 of dolomitic lime and trace elements, and at 3 \n\nmonths of age 12 g N m-2 and 0.45 mol K m-2 were applied as KCl. Field trials at the \n\nstudy site and in nearby areas on the same type of soil showed that the amounts of N, \n\nP, Ca, Mg and micronutrients applied in this experiment were not limiting for tree \n\ngrowth (GON\u00c7ALVES et al., 2007; LACLAU et al., 2009). Herbicides were applied to \n\navoid the presence of understory species. \n\nSince September 2010, throughfall was partially excluded in -W plots, using panels \n\nmade of clear greenhouse plastic sheets mounted on wooden frames at heights \n\nranging between 0.5 m and 1.6 m. Plastic sheets covered 37% of the area in the -W \n\nplots. A 50 cm deep trench was dug around the -W plots to limit the lateral development \n\nof Eucalyptus roots between + W and -W treatments. The dead leaves, branches and \n\nbark that fell on the plastic sheets were collected weekly and scattered under the \n\ngutters during the entire study. Water excluded from the gutters was collected weekly \n\nand samples were analyzed monthly to estimate the amounts of nutrients excluded \n\nduring the study period. These amounts of dissolved nutrients in the water were \n\nreplaced each year in each -W treatment (ammonium sulphate, KCl, NaCl, phosphorus \n\n...) to distinguish the effect of water exclusion and nutrient deficiency. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n70 \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 5 - Throughfall exclusion experiment located in the southeastern region \nof Brazil, at the Itatinga Forest Science Experimental Station in S\u00e3o Paulo state.  \n\n \n\nIn +W and -W, the eucalypt stands were harvested six years after planting, in June \n\n2016, and the plantation was coppice-managed thereafter. Several new shoots were \n\nregenerated from the stumps after the clear-cut and 1 or 2 shoots per stump were \n\nselected to maintain the same stocking density and prevent the growth of additional \n\nnew shoots. A third treatment served as a control, with undisturbed rainfall and no \n\nharvest (NH), to assess the clear-cutting effect. \n\nTwo deep permanent pits were excavated in +W and -W to gain access to the complete \n\nsoil profile from the top soil down to the water table. A third pit was excavated in the \n\nnon-harvested treatment (NH) down to 3.5 m to determine the clear-cut effect.  \n\nRoot dynamics were studied using minirhizotron over 1 year before clear-cutting, then \n\nover 2 years in coppice, as well as in the non-harvested plot (NH) serving as a control, \n\nand fine roots (i.e. diameter &lt;2 mm) were sampled down to 17 m in +W, -W and NH. \n\nMore complete descriptions of the methods used as well as the results obtained are \n\npresented in Chapter 2 \u00ab Consequences of clear-cutting and drought on fine root \n\ndynamics down to 17 m in coppice-managed eucalypt plantations \u00bb \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n71 \n \n\n        \n \n\nFigure 6 - Deep permanent pit down to a depth of 17 m in throughfall exclusion \nexperiment at the Itatinga Forest Science Experimental Station in S\u00e3o Paulo \nstate. \n\n \n\n \n\nCO2, CH4 and N2O surface effluxes at soil surface were measured over three years \n\nusing the closed-chamber method in -W, +W and NH.

The incorporation of these results in \n\nprocess-based models, as well as further studies dealing with long-term effect of water \n\navailability on soil properties might contribute to evaluate adaptive changes induced \n\nby global changes in tropical Eucalyptus plantations. \n\nK deficiency and water deficit affect traits involved in catching light resources, traits \n\ncontrolling CO2 assimilation, traits related to transport via xylem and phloem and soil \n\nwater and nutrient resources (Table 3). Indeed, K fertilization through drastic \n\n\n\n74 \n \n\n \n \n\nmodifications in leaves physiology greatly increased gross primary productivity and \n\nabove ground biomass production. A modeling approach revealed that soil water \n\nuptake parameters and leaf photosynthetic parameters were the main drivers of gross \n\nprimary productivity and light-use efficiency for carbon assimilation. Photosynthesis, \n\nanatomical and biochemical leaf treats in E. grandis had a functional relationship \n\nbetween K and Na supply. Osmotic adjustment, stomatal closure, higher phloem sugar \n\nconcentration, higher velocity of C transfer in phloem and a decrease in leaf area index \n\nwere observed when trees were subjected to water restriction and K deficiency. K \n\nfertilization and water availability modified xylem metabolome and transcriptome and \n\nimpacts greatly wood structure, and notably vessel properties. Water deficiency also \n\nincreased the mean soil depth of water withdrawal, decreased the residual soil water \n\ncontent in deep soil layers and lead to a drop in the water table.  \n\nFurthermore, reduced rainfall significantly increase exchangeable K and H3O+ within \n\nthe rhizosphere and enhanced at great depth. A complementary study showed for the \n\nfirst-time ectomycorrhizal symbiosis in deep soil layers and the population of Pisolithus \n\nsp., the dominated genus, was strongly dependent on soil depth (ROBIN et al., 2019). \n\nThose results combined suggest a different root functioning in response to drought \n\ncondition and especially in deep soil layers.  \n\nHowever, the influence of nutrient and water availability on root traits and root \n\ndynamics at depth remains poorly known despite its role in: i) microclimate, ii) tree \n\ngrowth during drought periods, iii) the potential for carbon sequestration in the deep \n\nlayers of tropical soils, iv) the recycling of nutrients. Improving the understanding of the \n\nenvironmental control of rooting strategies in trees is of interest beyond the scope of \n\nEucalyptus plantations in Brazil. Furthermore, the huge soil volume explored by fine \n\nroots might lead to significant CO2, N2O and CH4 productions, and improving our \n\nunderstanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of gas concentrations in deep soil layers \n\nis essential to quantify more accurately C source/sink fluxes in tropical soils. \n\nComprehensive experimental studies are needed to improve the current \n\nbiogeochemical models used to predict the effect of drought periods on greenhouse \n\ngas effluxes.  \n\n\n\n75 \n \n\n        \n \n\nTable 3 - Main results obtained in the experimental set up on the effects of \n\ndrought, Na deficit and K deficit on soil parameters, tree biomass and anatomy, \n\non the traits involved in the capture of light resources and/or controlling CO2 \n\nassimilation and traits controlling the transport of water into the plant and \n\ntranspiration.  indicates a positive effect,  indicates a negative trend and   \n\nindicates predominantly no effect. \n\n Na \ndeficit \n\nK \ndeficit \n\nWater \ndeficit \n\nReferences \n\nSoil parameters \n    \n\nSoil water content    BATTIE-LACLAU et al. \n2014; \n\nCHRISTINA et al. 2015; \nCHRISTINA et al. 2018 \n\nAmount of water stored in ground    CHRISTINA et al. 2018 \n\nDeep seepage    CHRISTINA et al. 2018 \n\nH3O+ rhizo/ H3O+ bulk    PRADIER 2016 \n\nKech rhizo / Kech bulk    PRADIER 2016 \n\nC rhizo/ C bulk    PRADIER 2016 \n\nH+ Al3+ rhizo    PRADIER 2016 \n\nBiomass and Anatomy \n\nTree height    CHRISTINA et al. 2015; \nEPRON et al. 2015 \n\nTrunk circumference at breast height    CHRISTINA et al. 2015 \n\nAboveground biomass    BATTIE-LACLAU et al. \n2016; BATTIE-LACLAU et \n\nal. 2014 \n\nStem wood biomass    BATTIE-LACLAU et al. 2016 \n\nWood production    BATTIE-LACLAU et al. 2016 \n\nWood density    PLOYET 2017 \n\nLeaf area    BATTIE-LACLAU et al. \n2013; \n\nBATTIE-LACLAU et al. \n2014; \n\nEPRON et al. 2015 \n\nLeaf thickness    BATTIE-LACLAU et al. 2014 \n\nLeaf biomass    EPRON et al. 2015 \n\nChlorophyll content    BATTIE-LACLAU et al. 2014 \n\nLeaves palisade    BATTIE-LACLAU et al. 2014 \n\nLeaves spongy    BATTIE-LACLAU et al. 2014 \n\nLeaves intercellular space    BATTIE-LACLAU et al. 2014 \n\nLeaves paracytic stomata    BATTIE-LACLAU et al. 2014 \n\nTraits involved in the capture of light resources and/or controlling CO2 assimilation \n\nLAI: Leaf area index    BATTIE-LACLAU et al. 2014 \n\nLeaf water potential at predown    BATTIE-LACLAU et al. \n2014; \nEPRON et al. 2015 \n\nLeaf water potential at midday    BATTIE-LACLAU et al. \n2014; \nEPRON et al. 2015 \n\n\n\n76 \n \n\n \n \n\nLeaf gas exchange    BATTIE-LACLAU et al. 2014 \n\nLeaf net primary production    BATTIE-LACLAU et al. 2016 \n\nAboveground net primary production    BATTIE-LACLAU et al. 2016 \n\nStomatal conductance    BATTIE-LACLAU et al. 2016 \n\nCanopy conductance     \n\nCrown CO2 uptake    EPRON et al. 2015 \n\n Na \ndeficit \n\nK \ndeficit \n\nWater \ndeficit \n\nReferences \n\nSoil parameters     \n\nTraits involved in the capture of light resources and/or controlling CO2 assimilation \n\nMaximum rate of photosynthetic \nelectron transport at 25\u00b0C \n\n   CHRISTINA et al. 2015 \n\nMaximum rate of rubisco \ncarboxylase activity at 25\u00b0C \n\n   CHRISTINA et al. 2015 \n\nGPP: Gross primary production    CHRISTINA et al. 2015 \n\nLUE: Light use efficiency    CHRISTINA et al. 2015 \n\naPar: absorbed photosynthetically \nactive radiation \n\n   CHRISTINA et al. 2015 \n\nWUE: Water use efficiency    BATTIE-LACLAU et al. 2016 \n\nTraits controlling the transport of water into the plant and transpiration \n\nSapwood cross section area    EPRON et al. 2015 \n\nXylem sap flux    EPRON et al. 2015 \n\nCambial activity    PLOYET 2017 \n\nCanopy transpiration    CHRISTINA et al. 2018 \n\nSoil water stress index    CHRISTINA et al. 2018 \n\nVessel diameter    PLOYET 2017 \n\nHydraulic conductivity    PLOYET 2017 \n\nTraits involved in the capture of water and nutrient resources \n\nSRL   ?

While knowledge on deep root \n\ndynamics is constantly expending, our understanding of the phenology, morphology, \n\nanatomy and role of deep fine roots is still largely incomplete. In this review, the current \n\nknowledge about fine root production, mortality and longevity in deep soil layers, and \n\nthe magnitude of the impacts and significance of deep fine root on carbon and nutrient \n\ncycling were discussed and highlighted. Deep fine roots are highly plastic in response \n\nto environmental conditions and soil resources. They present contrasting functional \n\ntraits and functional specializations compared to shallow roots and are mainly oriented \n\ntoward water acquisition and transport. Deep roots have a large impact on plant \n\ndevelopment and biogeochemical cycles through water and nutrient uptake, carbon \n\nallocation and sequestration in the soil. Therefore, modeling processes need to \n\nconsider deep root functioning and dynamics accurately to better estimate net \n\necosystem productivity and nutrients, carbon and water cycles.  \n\n \n\nKey words: fine root growth, root traits, root longevity, root production, root mortality, \n\ncarbon sequestration, tree plantations \n\n\n\n78 \n \n\n \n \n\n1. 1 Introduction \n\nRoots are plant's underground organs responsible for anchorage in the soil and \n\nabsorption of water and nutrients needed for plant development. The anchorage \n\nfunction is provided by the largest roots and mainly involves physical interactions \n\nbetween roots and the soil. The absorptive function is more complex as it involves \n\nbiogeochemical, biochemical and biological interactions between fine roots, soil, but \n\nalso soil microorganism. Roots develop often symbiosis with soil bacteria and fungi. \n\nFine roots have the ability to adapt to different environments to facilitate the \n\ndevelopment of the plant. Fine roots link plant metabolism to soil nutrient cycles, they \n\nare ephemeral and frequently replaced. They can modify the physical, chemical and \n\nbiotic soil properties by their activities which can have repercussions not only at the \n\nplant scale but also at the ecosystem level (McCormack et al., 2015). Indeed, fine roots \n\nplay a major role in the global carbon (C) cycle, representing significant C input into \n\nthe soil by the incorporation of exudates and root necromass, and generating a return \n\nof C to the atmosphere through respiration and decomposition processes (Balesdent \n\nand Balabane, 1996; Strand et al., 2008). Root systems are known to be very \n\nheterogeneous and plastic, both architecturally and functionally, depending on plant \n\nage and its phenology, soil conditions and climate (Hodge et al., 2009). Roots have \n\nthe capacity to expand over large soil volume, particularly with shrubs and trees, and \n\ncan be found at very great depths in xeric and drought ecosystems (Canadell et al., \n\n1996; Schenk and Jackson, 2002).  \n\nFine root dynamics are defined as fine root production and mortality (Hendrick and \n\nPregitzer, 1993; McCormack and Guo, 2014), finer root turnover and survivorship \n\n(Anderson et al., 2003), senescence (Huck et al., 1987) and fine root elongation rate \n\n(Germon et al., 2016; Lambais et al., 2017). Fine root dynamics are driven by both \n\nendogenous and exogenous factors like soil temperature and water content (Coll et \n\nal., 2012), hormones (McAdam et al., 2016), photosynthate and nutrient availability \n\n(Tierney and Fahey, 2002; Sloan et al., 2016), which may be considerably \n\nheterogeneous along the soil profile (Figure 1). However, deep fine root dynamics, \n\nfunctional significance and contribution to the water cycles and biogeochemistry \n\nprocesses at plant and ecosystem scale, are still poorly known. The objective of this \n\nstudy is to provide an up-to-date literature review on deep fine roots through their root \n\ntraits, morphology and phenology, and through the biotic and abiotic interactions with \n\n\n\n79 \n \n\n        \n \n\nthe soil environment. Previous studies on deep fine root production, mortality and \n\nlongevity, belowground C sequestration, symbiosis with mycorrhizae, and nutrient \n\nuptake will be reviewed more specifically.  \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - Conceptual model illustrating the relative magnitude of different controls on \nfine-root dynamics (according to Coleman et al. 2018). The width of the pyramid and \nshading reflects the relative magnitude of each factor. As the width narrows and \nshading decreases, the magnitude of the response decreases. \n\n1. 2 Defining deep fine roots \n\nThe importance of deep root system has been highlighted in several reviews (Canadell \n\net al., 1996; Maeght et al., 2013; Pierret et al., 2016) , but their dynamics and \n\nspecificities are still poorly known. Numerous rooting depth characteristics have been \n\nexamined since those studies, yet studies often claim that physiological and \n\nmorphological characteristics of deep root systems are poorly understood. Recently \n\ndefined by Maeght et al. (2013), deep roots are roots growing below a depth of 1 m. \n\nMore and more studies highlight that rooting depth has been underestimated, \n\nparticularly for shrubs and trees (Canadell et al., 1996). Even if a small number of roots \n\nare found at great depth, deep roots likely have a key role in many processes of plant \n\nphysiology, community ecology and geochemical cycles. Studies have demonstrated \n\nthat deep roots are found in many biomes, where drought conditions are commonly \n\nexhibited (Nepstad et al., 1994; Canadell et al., 1996; Jackson et al., 2000; Schenk \n\nand Jackson, 2002), but maximum rooting depth reported in the scientific literature is \n\nunderestimated because few studies have focused on deeper horizons (Schenk and \n\n\n\n80 \n \n\n \n \n\nJackson, 2002) and have artificially truncated the root distribution. Stone and Kalisz \n\n(1991) reported 37 examples of tree root colonization between 10 and 60 m below the \n\nsoil surface, indicating that the maximum rooting depth varies considerably with \n\nclimatic and soil conditions and between species. Canadell et al. (1996) reviewed that \n\nroots under different vegetation systems extend in deep horizons down to 9.5\u00b12.4 m \n\nin deserts, 7.3\u00b12.8 m in tropical evergreen forest and 15.0\u00b15.4 m in tropical grassland \n\nand savannah, with maximum rooting depths of 68 m for Eucalyptus trees.  \n\nOnce that considerable rooting depth has been highlighted, deep root distribution and \n\ndynamics need to be better described as it is still poorly studied compared to shallow \n\nroot distribution. Indeed, deep root studies are scarce despite the recent technical \n\nadvances and innovations because it is still difficult to access, time-consuming, \n\nexpensive and requires a combination of several methods to obtain the most reliable \n\nresults (Maeght et al., 2013). Methods for monitoring deep roots are grouped into direct \n\nand indirect techniques depending on the equipment needed, research aim and their \n\nrespective advantages and drawbacks (Vogt et al., 1998; Hendricks et al., 2006). N \n\nbudget, ecosystem carbon balance, starch and carbon fluxes approaches have been \n\nused to study and quantify indirectly deep root functioning at considerable soil depths \n\nand are described in detail by Vogt et al. (1998). As for the direct methods, excavation, \n\ntrenches, sequential coring, ingrowth cores, rhizotron, and minirhizotrons have been \n\nused to monitor root dynamics in situ and have been described in detail by Maeght et \n\nal. (2013). Both indirect and direct approaches present potential biases leading to \n\noverestimation or underestimation of root growth and decomposition. Despite all these \n\nmethods, there is no scientific consensus on which the most effective and reliable \n\nmethod is determining the dynamics of fine roots. Understanding spatial and temporal \n\nfine root distribution and functioning in deep soil layers is crucial for a better \n\nunderstanding of biosphere-atmosphere interactions (Zeng et al., 1998; Kleidon and \n\nHeimann, 2000), and hence for terrestrial biosphere models. Deep roots improve tree \n\ntolerance to drought (McDowell et al., 2008; Nardini et al., 2016) and store C in deep \n\nsoil layers (Laclau et al., 2013). Their importance in the C cycle and water flow has \n\nbeen demonstrated through modeling simulations (Saleska et al., 2007; Christoffersen \n\net al., 2014). Therefore, to understand and predict in the proper way water cycles, C \n\nsequestration, and primary production and many others ecosystem services we should \n\n\n\n81 \n \n\n        \n \n\nconsider deep soil layers as dynamics and functional systems where fine roots may be \n\ndifferent along the soil profile.  \n\n1. 3 Deep fine root morphology, architecture and anatomy  \n\nRoot morphology and architecture are important in determining a plant's availability to \n\nsurvive in stressful soil conditions and can influence considerably tree growth and \n\necosystem processes. Root system morphology and architecture vary largely between \n\nspecies but also within species (Cannon, 1949; Nibau et al., 2008). Functional traits \n\nalso vary with environmental conditions and resource distribution (Ostonen et al., \n\n2007). Root diameter and root length are two of the main criteria taken into account to \n\nevaluate root function and behavior. Fine roots have been classified into distinct \n\nclasses for different functions and metabolic activity: i) root for acquisition and uptake \n\nof soil resources, therefore classified as absorptive roots are extremely fine and are \n\nthe most distal roots; ii) root for transport and storage of nutrients are larger roots \n\nhigher up in the branching order, which are the main structural part of the fine root \n\nsystem. The high variability of the environmental conditions such as soil moisture and \n\ntemperature or nutrient availability along the soil depth result in contrasting fine root \n\nfunctional traits among depths. \n\nDeep fine root exploration also leads to an important metabolic cost for plants (Iversen, \n\n2010) which affect changes in fine root traits (Prieto et al., 2015). The specific root \n\nlength (SRL) and specific root area (SRA) are the two main root traits affected by depth \n\n(Maurice et al., 2010; Prieto et al., 2015; Pinheiro et al., 2016). They represent together \n\nthe volume of the root in contact with the soil, and indirectly describe the capacity to \n\ntake up limited soil resources by the plant (Maurice et al., 2010). There are few studies \n\non the variation of specific root length and specific root area according to soil depth \n\n(Makita et al., 2011; Prieto et al., 2015; Pinheiro et al., 2016), but the trends are still \n\nnot clear. Indeed, Pinheiro et al. (2016) found a slight increase in SRL and SRA with \n\nsoil depth down to 13.5 m for 4 different genotypes of Eucalyptus in Brazil. Maurice et \n\nal. (2010) also found that SRL increased down to a depth of 3 m in Eucalyptus \n\nplantations of different ages. Adriano et al. (2017) found no significant changes in SRL \n\nwith soil depth down to 8 m in Citrus sinensis plantations, but they observed a tendency \n\ntoward an increase in mean fine root diameters. Gwenzi et al. (2011) found that roots \n\ntended to be thicker down to a depth of 1.4 m in Acacia rostellifera and Melaleuca \n\n\n\n82 \n \n\n \n \n\nnesophila plantations in Western Australia. Prieto et al. (2015) measured root \n\nfunctional traits in 20 plant communities in 3 climatic zones: tropical climate, montane \n\nclimate, and sub-humid Mediterranean climate. They found that fine roots were thicker \n\nin deep soil layer down to a depth of 1.6 m compared to the shallow layers. On the \n\ncontrary, Sochacki et al. (2017) observed that root diameter decreased systematically \n\nwith depth down to 6 m in Eucalyptus globulus plantations in southwest Australia, and \n\nBakker et al. (2009) found that SRL decreased with depth down to 1.2 m in Pinus \n\npinaster plantations in the southwest of France. Fast-growing species require a rapid \n\nand efficient acquisition of above and belowground resources; therefore, they generally \n\nhave a higher specific root area and specific root length compared to slow growing \n\nspecies particularly in deep soil layers (Ryser, 2006; Reich, 2014; Jo et al., 2015). \n\nRoots of high SRL and thinner diameter are often associated with a better exploitation \n\ncapacity (Hodge, 2004), and they increase the amount of root surface area in contact \n\nwith soil water. Establishing a deep root system with a high surface area allows the \n\nextraction of water from a larger soil volume (Jackson et al., 2000). Deep roots are \n\nmainly oriented toward water acquisition and transport. Indeed, McElrone et al. (2004) \n\nfound that deep roots of Juniperus ashei, Bumelia lanuginosa, Quercus fusiformis and \n\nQuercus sinuate had higher vessel diameter and larger tracheid than shallow roots in \n\ndeep soil layers down to 18-20 m (Figure 2). They also found that deep roots had a \n\ngreater hydraulic conductivity. In line with those results, Pate et al. (1995) reported that \n\nroots at a depth of 2 m had larger xylem conduits, higher length, specific area, and \n\nhydraulic conductivities, up to 15 times higher than roots in shallow layers for Australian \n\nspecies. Physiological and anatomical adjustment of fine roots in deep soil seems to \n\nbe developed by plants to maximize hydraulic efficiency. Despite those results, studies \n\non fine root morphology and anatomy at great depth are still scarce.   \n\n\n\n83 \n \n\n        \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 - Scanning electron micrographs of stems (top row), shallow roots (middle \nrow) and deep roots (bottom row, 18-20 m) for Quercus fusiformis, Juniperus ashei \nBuchh., Quercus sinuata (Torr.) C.H. Mull and Bumelia lanuginosa tree species from \nthe Edward\u2019s Plateau region of central Texas (According to McElrone et al. 2004). \n\n1. 4 Deep fine roots phenology \n\nFine roots in deep soil layers present contrasting phenology compared to roots in \n\nshallow soil layers. Indeed, several studies have shown an asynchrony between \n\nshallow and deep root emergence. Maeght et al. (2015) observed that shallow fine root \n\nemergence of Hevea brasiliensis was synchronized with rainfall events and ceased \n\nduring the dry season. On the contrary deep fine root emergence occurred at the end \n\nof the wet season and continued during the dry season below a depth of 2.5 m. Germon \n\net al. (2016) also observed an asynchrony between shallow and deep roots in an \n\nagroforestry system in the south of France. They found that summer season was \n\ndominated by shallow root growth and winter season by deep root growth (> 2.5m). \n\nSimilar results were observed in Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil, where root growth \n\npeaked below a depth of 3 m at the end of the dry season (Lambais et al., 2017; \n\nGermon et al., 2019). Germon et al. (2019) even found a negative correlation between \n\nthe amount of extractable water in the topsoil and the flushes of growth in deep soil \n\nlayers. Deep root growth seems to be related to overall tree water demand and \n\ncontrolled by the need for trees to use increasingly deeper water resources when water \n\nin the topsoil becomes scarce. Studies have shown that fine root elongation rates in \n\n\n\n84 \n \n\n \n \n\ndeep soil are more intense than in the topsoil, reaching several centimeters per day \n\n(Laclau et al., 2013; Germon et al., 2016; Lambais et al., 2017; Germon et al., 2019). \n\nA near-symmetrical above and below ground growth rates were observed by Christina \n\net al. (2011) in Eucalyptus plantations reaching 10.4 and 19.2 m in height and a \n\nmaximum rooting depth of 9.2 and 15.8 m at ages of 1.5 and 3.5 years, respectively. \n\nThose results are in line with the growth rates of Eucalyptus observed by Lambais et \n\nal. (2017) in nutrient-poor soil of Brazil with a mean fine root elongation rate increasing \n\nwith soil depth up to 3.6 cm day-1 below a depth of 3 m. Increasing root growth rate is \n\noften seen as another feature of drought adaptation (Annerose and Cornaire, 1994). \n\nThis high root elongation rate in deep soil layers could be a response to improve water \n\nand nutrients uptake, which confirm the positive feedback from developing roots to \n\ndevelop shoot (Friend et al., 1994). Fast root growth requires fast and efficient nutrient \n\nand water acquisition and thus a fast exploration of the deep soil layer. Environmental \n\nconditions and plant growth regulators may control those mechanisms (L\u00f3pez-Bucio \n\net al., 2003). Deep soil layers are assumed to have higher soil water content and low-\n\ntemperature variations compared to shallow layers (Du and Fang, 2014; Radville et al., \n\n2016). Thus, climatic factors being more buffered in the deep soil layer, fluctuating less \n\nduring day and season, are not affecting equally root phenology along with the soil \n\nprofile. Deep fine root phenology could be also controlled by other factors. Indeed, \n\ndeep roots are more distant from the shoot and the time to receive photosynthates \n\nwould take longer to occur. A slow process phloem transport could also explain the \n\ndelay between shallow and deep root growth currently observed. Yet there are still \n\nmajor uncertainties about the mechanisms controlling fine root phenology in deep soil \n\nlayers.  \n\n1. 5 Mycorrhizal associations \n\nRoot systems are also characterized by their likelihood of association with mycorrhizal \n\nfungi. Interactions between plant root system and mycorrhizal fungi have many \n\nbeneficial effects. It can provide a source of C for mycorrhizal respiration in exchange \n\nfor increased exploitation and transfer of water and nutrient from soil to the plant. Soil \n\ndepth influence the diversity of microorganism and community composition as nutrient \n\nsupply and oxygen is less favorable for microbial decomposition (Eilers et al., 2012; \n\nSantos et al., 2016). However, an abundant and diverse microbial community and high \n\nlevel of bacterial biomass have been found in very deep soil layers (Dodds et al., 1996; \n\n\n\n85 \n \n\n        \n \n\nGocke et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2017). Stone et al. (2014) studied microbial community \n\ncharacteristics down to a depth of 1.4 m in a tropical soil of northeastern Puerto Rico. \n\nThey unexpectedly found that extracellular microbial activity decreased in deep soil \n\nlayers but C acquiring enzymes activities increased with depth. Recently, Robin et al. \n\n(2019) observed ectomycorrhizal roots down to a depth of 4 meters in a deeply \n\nweathered soil under Eucalyptus trees in Brazil. Deep root symbiosis with \n\nmicroorganism could potentially impact nutrient acquisition in deep soil layers and may \n\nenhance the exploitation of nutrient stock throughout the entire soil profile. Indeed, \n\nsome studies highlighted that deep root and shallow roots had a different form of \n\nmycorrhizal symbioses (Rosling et al., 2003; Clemmensen et al., 2013). However, as \n\nfor deep root functioning, studies on mycorrhizal symbiosis in deep soil are still very \n\nlimited partly due to the difficulty to collect soil at such depths. Studying biological \n\nactivities in deep soil layers is crucial for the scientific community and become \n\nincreasingly important to address in future studies, yet it remains a methodological and \n\ntechnical challenge (Gocke et al., 2017).  \n\n1. 6 Influence of soil resources and environmental parameters \n\nSoil resources and environment parameters are constantly changing. Deep roots are \n\nhighly plastic in response to heterogeneous resource distributions (Hodge et al., 2009). \n\nThey have the ability to adapt to changing resource availability and in particular to \n\nwater availability, nutrients availability, soil texture, and atmospheric constituents. The \n\nvariability of environmental factors affecting root growth are buffered in deep soil \n\ncondition compared to the considerable variability observed at the soil surface \n\n(Voroney, 2007). Differences in root structure, architecture, and production in deep soil \n\nlayers might be attributed to differences in soil resources and physical properties.  \n\nSoil water content is maybe the main driver for root production in the deep soil layers. \n\nAdriano et al. (2017) observed that fine root mass of Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck \n\nincreased in drought conditions, particularly in deep soil layers. Schenk and Jackson \n\n(2002) reported that rooting depths were correlated with the length of the dry season \n\nand annual precipitation in tropical climates. The longer dry season and lower annual \n\nprecipitation, the deeper was the root system. Wang et al. (2015) also found a strong \n\ncorrelation between root mass and soil water content down to a depth of 21 m in \n\nplanted grassland and shrubland in China. Drought can increase the proportion of fine \n\n\n\n86 \n \n\n \n \n\nroots in deep soil layers and/or the specific root area (Markesteijn and Poorter, 2009; \n\nMa et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2018). In a survey of 62 tropical tree species, Markesteijn \n\nand Poorter (2009) showed that trees increase the belowground biomass and the \n\nproportion of deep roots in response to dry conditions. Germon et al. (2019) showed \n\nan increase in SRL and SRA under drought conditions for Eucalyptus trees in Brazil. \n\nRoot growth peaks have been shown in deep soil layers during dry periods for eucalypt \n\nand rubber trees in tropical soils (Maeght et al., 2015; Lambais et al., 2017). Plant \n\nspecies use a large range of rooting patterns to cope with periodic drought, from \n\n\"drought tolerant strategies\" with fine roots surviving in periodically dry soil to \"drought \n\navoiding strategies\" shedding fine roots from dry soil horizons while rapidly developing \n\nroots in moister areas (Brunner et al., 2015; Vries et al., 2016; Bristiel et al., 2018). \n\nRoot dynamics are also strongly correlated to the depth of the water table. Li et al. \n\n(2015) found a higher root growth rate when the water table was artificially deeper for \n\nAlhagi sparsifolia Shap. (Leguminosae). They found a root front growth of 0.66 cm d-1 \n\nwhen the water table was at a depth of 0.8 m and 1.5 cm d-1 when the water table was \n\nat a depth of 2.2 m. Canham et al. (2012) found a seasonal distribution of fine root \n\nbiomass in deep soil layers following the fluctuations of the depth of the water table. A \n\ndeeper water table level might induce a higher root elongation downwards (Stave et \n\nal., 2005; Canham, 2011). \n\nSoil texture also influences morphological acclimation of a deep root system. Root \n\ndistribution has been showed to be shallower in sandy soils than in soil with a finer \n\ntexture as shown in a tropical evergreen forest by Schenk and Jackson (2002). Xu and \n\nLi (2009) observed that root of Haloxyolon ammodendron C.A. Mey penetrated down \n\nto a depth of 10 m in a sandy soil, while it only reached 3 m in a heavy soil.  Roots had \n\na higher root surface area in the sandy soil compared to roots growing in the heavy \n\nsoil. Freycon et al. (2015) also compared root distribution down to 6 m for \n\nEntandrophragma cylindricum Sprague (Meliaceae) grown in two different soil types: \n\nArenosols and Ferralsols in an African semi-deciduous rainforest. They found that fine \n\nroot intersects on vertical pit walls were lower in coarse-textured soils (e.g. Arenosols) \n\nthan in fine-textured soils (e.g. Ferralsols). However, Canadell et al. (1996) cited some \n\nexamples of roots reaching great depths in rocky soils.  \n\n\n\n87 \n \n\n        \n \n\nIn most plant-soil systems, the amount of available nutrients is a growth-limiting factor. \n\nIndeed, McCulley et al. (2004) studied fine roots and nutrient distribution down to a \n\ndepth of 10 m in five semi-arid and arid sites in the southwestern USA. They found that \n\nroots responded through morphological and physiological adjustment in response to \n\nnutrient availability within the soil profile. Bordron et al. (2019) found that fertilization \n\nincreased the capacity of fine roots of Eucalyptus grandis to take up nutrients down to \n\na depth of 3.2 m. They also found that adding nutrients increased root mass density, \n\nspecific root length and specific root area along with the soil profile down to 3 m. On \n\nthe contrary, Jourdan et al. (2008) showed that an increase in N content did not \n\ninfluence fine root biomass down to 3.0 m. Root growth and functioning are inhibited \n\nby high pH values due to nutrient deficiencies and specific ion toxicities (Hinsinger, \n\n2001; Hinsinger et al., 2003; Jacobs and Timmer, 2005). The response of fine root \n\nproduction and mortality on nutrient availability in deep soil layers is not completely \n\nunderstood and further studies are needed.   \n\nMany studies have focused on the impact of elevated CO2 concentrations in the \n\natmosphere on plant growth. Fine root responses in changing CO2 conditions are still \n\npoorly known but some trends have emerged. Iversen (2010) reviewed that rising \n\natmospheric CO2 concentration tends to deeper rooting distributions of forested \n\necosystems. However, the set of studies used to focus on the upper soil profile down \n\nto usually a depth of 1 m. To our knowledge, only one study reached the threshold of \n\n1 m depth concerning the influence of elevated atmospheric CO2 on root properties. \n\nIndeed, Duursma et al. (2011) found that root water uptake of Eucalyptus saligna \n\nplantation in Australia was higher at depth > 1 m when trees are subjected to higher \n\natmospheric CO2 concentrations. Studies on the influence of elevated CO2 on root \n\nbiomass production and distribution need to be carried in much greater detail, and \n\nparticularly in deep soil layers.  \n\n1. 7 Deep fine root biomass and carbon sequestration \n\nIt is essential to assess more precisely the capacity of ecosystems to store carbon to \n\npredict their potential role on the mitigation of the future economic and ecological \n\nchallenges linked to climate changes. More and more research effort focused on C \n\naccounting across ecosystems. Fine roots play a major role in the global carbon cycle. \n\nThey represent a significant C input to the soil by the incorporation of exudates and \n\n\n\n88 \n \n\n \n \n\nroot necromass and generate a return of C to the atmosphere through respiration and \n\ndecomposition processes (Balesdent and Balabane, 1996; Strand et al., 2008). \n\nEstimating fine root production, biomass and turnover throughout the entire soil profile \n\nis therefore compulsory in this context.  \n\nEven if root density decrease with depth, some studies evidenced that total root \n\nbiomass below the threshold of 1 m depth can account for more than currently \n\nadmitted. Indeed, Maeght et al. (2015) found that more than 50% of the overall fine \n\nroot biomass was below 1 m depth in a rubber plantation in Thailand. Fine root biomass \n\nbetween 1.0 and 4.0 m was 5.8 t ha-1 and was only 4.8 t ha-1 in the soil layer 0-1 m. In \n\nline with those results, Pinheiro et al. (2016) found that fine root length below 0.5 m \n\nrepresented 61-77% of the total fine root length down to the root front in Eucalyptus \n\nplantations. In an agroforestry system in the south of France, Cardinael et al. (2015) \n\nfound that 35% of the total fine root intersection densities of walnut trees were below \n\na depth of 2 m. In the same site, using the minirhizotron technique, Germon et al. \n\n(2016) measured that 25% of total fine root production was observed below a depth of \n\n4 m. Falkiner et al. (2006) observed that Eucalyptus grandis root proliferation resulted \n\nin equal root length densities between 0-0.5 m and 2.4-2.8 m soil layers in another \n\nagroforestry system in south-eastern Australia. Germon et al. (2018) observed fine root \n\nbiomass represented 31% of total biomass in Eucalyptus grandis monospecific stands, \n\n52% in Acacia mangium monospecific stands and 37% in a mixture stands with 50% \n\nof both species in the 0-1 m soil layers. Furthermore, the proportion of roots at great \n\ndepth increase with stand age: Ma et al. (2013) found that fine roots below 1 m \n\nrepresented 10.54 %, 29.62% and 42.42% of the total roots in 2 years, 4 years and 12 \n\nyears of Ziziphus jujube Mill. CV. Lizao plantation in China, and Laclau et al. (2013) \n\nfound that fine roots below a depth of 4 m represented 5%, 10% and 15% of total fine \n\nroots in year 1, 3.5 and 6 after planting of Eucalyptus plantation in Brazil. Li et al. (2019) \n\nobserved that rooting depth increased with increasing stand age, reaching 23.2 m in a \n\n22-year-old apple orchard stand in a sub-humid region of China, and roots below a \n\ndepth of 1 m accounted for 49% of the total root biomass. Therefore, deep roots \n\nrepresent a high proportion of the total root system and might contribute to \n\nsequestrating large amounts of C in soil (Matamala et al., 2003; Rasse et al., 2005) \n\nespecially in deep soil layers (Kell, 2012).  \n\n\n\n89 \n \n\n        \n \n\nSeveral studies have shown that root lifespan generally increases with soil depth \n\n(Hendrick and Pregitzer, 1996; Baddeley and Watson, 2005). Wells et al. (2002) found \n\nthat root longevity of Prunus persica L. significantly increased with soil depth down to \n\n1.6 m. Germon et al. (2016) also found a higher proportion of walnut root mortality in \n\nthe topsoil that in the deep soil layers with a median life span of 167 days within the \n\nfirst soil meter and 208 days at 2.5-4.7 m depth in an agroforestry system in the south \n\nof France. But on the contrary, Maeght et al. (2015) found that root life span decreased \n\nwith soil depth down to a depth of 4.5 m in a rubber tree plantation in Thailand. Maeght \n\net al. (2015) found that roots between the depth of 1 and 2.5 m had a turnover of about \n\n180-250 days and roots below 3 m of soil depth had a turnover of about 120 days. \n\nLambais et al. (2017) found no significant differences in root lifespan of Eucalyptus \n\ntrees between the topsoil and a depth of 6 m in Brazil, but root mortality represented \n\nalmost 20% in the topsoil and only 3.4 % between 5 and 6 m depth. It is known that \n\nenvironmental parameters (e.g., temperature, water content, N availability, CO2 and \n\nprobably O2 partial pressure) influence fine root turnover to variable degrees (Vogt et \n\nal. 1996), which could explain the opposite trends observed by those studies. Fine root \n\ndecomposition rate affects the ability of ecosystems to store organic C and act as a \n\nsink for CO2. The capacity of a different ecosystem to sequestrate carbon is related to \n\nthe depth where roots are being decomposed. When roots are decomposed, parts of \n\nthe former tissues are incorporated into the soil organic matter (Strand et al., 2008). \n\nDe Camargo et al. (1999) found that fine roots were being decomposed at least down \n\nto a depth of 5 m in eastern Amazon. Nepstad et al. (1994) estimated using isotopic \n\ntracers that C stocks below a depth of 1 m exceed organic soil C in the topsoil layer \n\ndown to 1 m and the above-ground organic C in an Amazonian tropical forest. Indeed, \n\nthe deep root system of this Amazonian forest input a large amount of organic carbon \n\ninto the soil by root exudations, mycorrhizal associations and dead root tissues \n\n(Nepstad et al., 1994). Moreover, the microbial biomass is lower in deep soil layers \n\nthan in the topsoil, which in combination with oxygen limitations could enhance organic \n\nC sequestration as a result of low mineralization rates (Taylor et al., 2002; Rumpel and \n\nK\u00f6gel-Knabner, 2011). Organic C derived from roots is generally more sequestered in \n\nthe soil than organic C coming from the aboveground litter. The latter is more affected \n\nby physicochemical processes and has a different structural composition (Rasse et al., \n\n2005; Schmidt et al., 2011; Menichetti et al., 2015). It is therefore essential to estimate \n\nfine root production, biomass and turnover, and associated microbial communities \n\n\n\n90 \n \n\n \n \n\nthroughout the entire soil profile according to its environment to estimate adequately \n\nthe overall C sequestration. \n\n1. 8 Deep fine root functioning and nutrient mobilization \n\nIn addition to their importance for water uptake, deep fine roots may be essential to \n\nsupply trees\u2019 nutrient requirements. Yet deep root functioning may vary over soil depth \n\nand the presence of roots in a given soil layer may not always correspond to root \n\nactivity (Phillips et al., 2016). Indeed, G\u00f6ransson et al. (2006) showed that equal root \n\nabundance does not mean equal uptake of nutrients in Quercus robur L. plantations \n\nand that there is a contrasting potential uptake between deep and shallow layers. The \n\ndepth of nutrient uptake performed by tree roots is commonly estimated using tracers. \n\nBordron et al. (2019) showed a functional specialization of Eucalyptus fine roots to take \n\nup cations varying over depth from 15NO3?, Rb+ (K+ analog) and Sr2+ (Ca2+ analog) \n\ntracers injected at depths of 10, 50, 150 and 300 cm in a sandy Ferralsol soil in Brazil. \n\nThey demonstrated that potential uptake of fine roots of 2-year-old Eucalyptus trees \n\nwas significantly higher at a depth of 3 m than in the topsoil for Rb+ and Sr2+. Da Silva \n\net al. (2011) also found an increase of the uptake rates at depth for K+ and Ca2+ analogs \n\ncompared to the topsoil in a 6-year-old Eucalyptus plantation, and on the contrary, they \n\nfound that NO3- uptake was higher in the topsoil than at 3 m. Therefore, trees show \n\ngreat flexibility in root development and on their capability to adjust resource uptake in \n\nlayers where the resources are available (Jackson et al., 1990; Hutchings and de \n\nKroon, 1994; Robinson, 1996). The functional specialization of deep roots is important \n\nto reduced nutrient losses through deep drainage (Laclau et al., 2010). The previous \n\nestimations of nutrient leaching may therefore be over-estimated, as they were not \n\nconsidering nutrient uptake by deep roots when measuring only soil water \n\nconcentration and fluxes at depth. \n\nDeep roots strongly influence the water cycles and are essential to sustain high tree \n\ntranspiration in the dry season (Kleidon and Heimann, 2000; Saleska et al., 2007). Soil \n\nwater content monitoring and the use of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes allow to \n\nestimate at which depth root water uptake is performed (Guderle and Hildebrandt, \n\n2015; Beyer et al., 2016; Koeniger et al., 2016; Trogisch et al., 2016; Beyer et al., \n\n2018). Stahl et al. (2013) showed that 46.1% of the trees were extracting water at or \n\nbelow a depth of 1.2 m in a tropical rainforest. Trees developed efficient strategies for \n\n\n\n91 \n \n\n        \n \n\nwater resource acquisition in deep soil layers using deep roots, which may also help \n\nsustain shallow root functioning during drought through hydraulic redistribution \n\n(Burgess et al., 1998; Domec et al., 2004; Bleby et al., 2010). Burgess et al. (2001) \n\nhave demonstrated that Eucalyptus species have the capacity to redistribute water \n\nfrom wetter deep layers into shallow soil layers through roots. Furthermore, a modeling \n\napproach showed that the occurrence of rainfall events, changing from a week to \n\nanother, had a strong impact on which depth water uptake occurs (Christina et al., \n\n2017). Recently, Li et al. (2019) showed that the extraction of deep soil water by the \n\nroot system of apple orchard stands was mainly occurring at depths below 12 m in a \n\nsub-humid region of China. They also found that roots in the 1-12 m layer remained \n\nalive mainly to transport the water absorbed below 12 m as they might not extract \n\nadditional water (Li et al., 2019). Therefore, modeling processes need to consider deep \n\nroot functioning to estimate net ecosystem productivity as a deep-water loss might \n\ncontribute equivalently to the evaporation at the global scale than sallow soil water \n\nloss.   \n\n1. 9 Deep fine root and modeling approaches \n\nModeling architecture development and dynamics of the deep fine roots is hindered by \n\nthe limited data available in the literature, yet indispensable to parametrize and \n\nevaluate the models. Root number, root diameter, root volume, and root radial \n\ndistances are the main parameters of root system biomechanics (Nicoll and Ray, 1996; \n\nDanquechin Dorval et al., 2016), varying considerably with soil layers. Soil depth \n\nstrongly influences the root system architecture due to the heterogeneity of its \n\nenvironment. Root architectural models could simulate accurately spatial and temporal \n\ndynamics through a simulation of the root system in 3D. Integrating a vertically \n\ndiscretized soil into a model is particularly important as shallow and deep roots present \n\ndifferent spatial and temporal dynamics. Model parametrization needs to consider \n\nshallow and deeper-rooted systems behaving differently according to the \n\nenvironmental factors and soil conditions. Indeed, these models are parametrized \n\naccording to the definition of root types (e.g. RootTyp from Pag\u00e8s et al. (2004) or DigR \n\nfrom Barczi et al. (2018)) or by branching order (e.g. OpenSimRoot from Postma et al. \n\n(2017)) or through parametric L-system modeling (Leitner et al., 2010) which also might \n\nvary with soil layer. Such a model without discretized processes by soil layers is not \n\ncapable to simulate accurately the impact of environmental conditions and soil \n\n\n\n92 \n \n\n \n \n\nresources on root development. Models devoted to simulating water and nutrient \n\nuptake dynamics need to integrate the functional specialization of deep roots and root \n\ngrowth plasticity in response to environmental conditions, in particular in deep soil \n\nlayers. However, most root functioning rules are still not completely understood, \n\nespecially for the ones occurring at great depth due to the extreme difficulty of \n\nmeasuring those processes in situ. Therefore, model calibration must cope with this \n\nknowledge and experimental limits. Architectural models can also be coupled with \n\nmodels simulating nutrient uptake (Mayer, 1999; Bonneu et al., 2012; Mayer et al., \n\n2012), water transport (Doussan et al., 1998) or rhizospheric processes (Kim and Silk, \n\n1999) or even reactive transport model (Mayer, 1999; Mayer et al., 2012; G\u00e9rard et al., \n\n2017). Nevertheless, it can be convenient to simulate accurately the overall \n\narchitecture and any specialized functions of deep roots compared to shallow roots.  \n\nFurthermore, deep roots have a strong influence on deep carbon stocks, which \n\nrepresent a significant amount of carbon (Jobb\u00e1gy and Jackson, 2004) and can be \n\npartially renewed at the 10-year scale (Baisden and Parfitt, 2007; Koarashi et al., \n\n2012). Models predicting soil organic carbon stocks through a single soil layer \n\nmodeling approach (Hansen et al., 1991; Sallih and Pansu, 1993; Petersen et al., 2005; \n\nPansu et al., 2010; Oelbermann and Voroney, 2011) are therefore not considering \n\ndeep soil and their roots that play an active role in carbon cycling. In recent years, an \n\nawareness of the importance of deep carbon stocks by the modeling community has \n\nled to the development of different discretized models depending on the soil depth \n\n(Braakhekke et al., 2011; Braakhekke et al., 2013; Guenet et al., 2013; Taghizadeh-\n\nToosi et al., 2014). However, modeling accurately deep root dynamics and their active \n\nrole for carbon allocation, nutrient and water uptake according to the plant \n\ndevelopment over time remains a major challenge for the next decades. \n\n  \n\n\n\n93 \n \n\n        \n \n\n1. 10 Conclusion \n\nDeep root systems are complex components of ecosystems. Deep roots display \n\ndifferent functional specialization, anatomy and morphology and are mainly oriented \n\ntoward water acquisition and transport (Table 1 - Root traits at depth compared to the \n\ntopsoil.  indicates a predominantly positive trend,  indicates a predominantly \n\nnegative trend and indicates predominantly no effect. Categories of root traits and \n\nindividual root traits are adapted from Brunner et al. 2015, Brunner et al. 2009, \n\nMcCormack et al. 2012, Prieto et al. 2015. \n\n). Climatic factors affect differently root phenology along with the soil profile as there \n\nare more buffered in deep soil layers. Research devoted to deep fine root dynamics \n\nlinking anatomical, architectural and functional characteristics along very deep soil \n\nprofiles to site characteristics, species and soil conditions should be carried out to gain \n\ninsight into their impact on C, water and nutrient cycles. Deep fine root display plasticity \n\nby responding to changing soil conditions and have an important role for ecosystem \n\nfunctioning. It is then crucial to focus the research efforts on the understanding of deep \n\nroot dynamics and associated functions which could have a significant influence on \n\nclimate change mitigation.  \n\nTable 1 - Root traits at depth compared to the topsoil.  indicates a predominantly \n\npositive trend,  indicates a predominantly negative trend and indicates \npredominantly no effect.

The evaluation \n\nof the contribution of fine roots in deep soil layers is a real metrological challenge and, \n\nin fact, a major scientific lock, which is important to raise to study the sustainability of \n\nagroecosystems and forest plantation, as well as their resilience, in the context of \n\nglobal changes. \n\nThe central objective of this following chapter is to assess the effect of clear-cutting \n\nand drought on fine-root production throughout deep soil profiles down to the water \n\ntable in coppice-managed Brazilian eucalypt plantations. These effects were monitored \n\nbefore and after trees harvest in a coppice-managed Eucalyptus grandis plantation \n\nunder two contrasting water supply regimes.  \n\nThis chapter presents the results of 3 years of root dynamics monitoring and was \n\npublished in the journal Forest Ecology and Management as scientific article with the \n\ntitle: \u201cConsequences of clear-cutting and drought on fine root dynamics down to 17 m \n\nin coppice-managed eucalypt plantations\u201d.

Our study aimed to assess the effect of clear-cutting and drought on fine-root \n\ndynamics down to the water table in Brazilian ferralsol under eucalypt plantations \n\nconducted in coppice. Fine roots (i.e. diameter &lt;2 mm) were sampled down to 17 m \n\ndeep in a throughfall exclusion experiment comparing stands with 37% of throughfall \n\nexcluded by plastic sheets (-W) and stands without rain exclusion (+W). Root dynamics \n\nwere studied using minirhizotron in two permanent pits down to 17 m deep, over 1 year \n\nbefore clear-cutting, then over 2 years in coppice, as well as down to 4 m deep in a \n\nnon-harvested plot (NH) serving as a control. After harvesting, a spectacular fine root \n\ngrowth of trees conducted in coppice occurred in very deep soil layers (> 13 m) and, \n\nsurprisingly, root mortality remained extremely low whatever the depth and the \n\ntreatment. Total fine-root biomass in coppice down to 17 m depth was 1266 and 1017 \n\ng m-2 in +W and -W, respectively, at 1.5 year after the clear-cut and was 1078 g m-2 in \n\nNH 7.5 years after planting. Specific root length and specific root area were about 15% \n\nhigher in -W than in +W. Proliferation of fine roots at great depths could be an adaptive \n\nmechanism for tree survival, enhancing the access to water stored in the subsoil. The \n\nroot system established before clear-cutting provides access to water stored in very \n\ndeep layers that probably contribute to mitigate the risk of tree mortality during \n\nprolonged drought periods when the eucalypt plantations is conducted in coppice after \n\nthe clear-cut. \n\nKey words: Brazil, coppice, deep ferralsol profile, deep root growth, Eucalyptus \n\ngrandis, minirhizotron, throughfall exclusion \n\n  \n\n\n\n110 \n \n\n \n \n\n2.1 Introduction  \n\nFuture climate projections predict longer and more severe dry periods in tropical and \n\nsubtropical regions (Dai, 2011; He &amp; Soden, 2017; Solomon et al., 2009). Extensive \n\ntree mortality triggered by drought and changes in rainfall patterns has been reported \n\nworldwide (Allen, 2009; McDowell et al., 2018; Williams et al., 2013). Tree survival \n\ngreatly depends on rooting system behavior and functioning (Christina et al., 2017b; \n\nMarkewitz et al., 2010; Nepstad et al., 1994; Pierik  &amp; Testerink, 2014), as plant growth \n\nis highly dependent on the absorptive function of fine roots for water and nutrients \n\n(Hinsinger, 2001). Fine roots also play a major role in the global carbon (C) cycle, \n\nrepresenting significant C input into the soil by the incorporation of exudates and root \n\nnecromass, and also generating a return of C to the atmosphere through respiration \n\nand decomposition processes (Balesdent &amp; Balabane, 1996; Strand et al., 2008). \n\nImproving our understanding of how root systems respond to drought is therefore \n\ncrucial for terrestrial biosphere models to predict the effect of climate change on tree \n\nsurvival and carbon sequestration in forest and tree-based ecosystems.  \n\nPlant species use a large range of rooting patterns to cope with periodic drought, from \n\n\u201cdrought tolerant strategies\u201d with fine roots surviving in periodically dry soil, to \u201cdrought \n\navoiding strategies\u201d shedding fine roots from dry soil horizons while rapidly developing \n\nroots in moister areas (Bristiel et al., 2018; Brunner et al., 2015; Vries et al., 2016). \n\nDrought can increase the root-to-shoot ratio, the root area or root length-to-leaf area \n\nratio, as well as the proportion of fine roots in deep soil layers and/or the specific root \n\narea (Ma et al., 2018; Markesteijn &amp; Poorter, 2009; Zhou et al., 2018). Root growth \n\npeaks have been shown in deep soil layers during dry periods for eucalypt and rubber \n\ntrees in tropical soils (Lambais et al., 2017; Maeght et al., 2015a). Drought tolerance \n\nstrategies are common for herbaceous plants, while drought avoiding strategies are \n\noften adopted by trees in evergreen tropical forests (Brunner et al., 2015). Despite the \n\ncrucial role of fine roots in coping with drought, root phenology remains poorly \n\nunderstood in comparison to leaf ecophysiology (Radville et al., 2016a).  \n\nDeep roots commonly reported as roots growing beyond 1 m in depth can play an \n\nimportant role in supplying water to trees (Kell, 2012; Pierret et al., 2016a). Trees can \n\nbe deeply rooted (Canadell et al., 1996; Schenk &amp; Jackson, 2002), and some studies \n\nsuggest that very deep roots (at depths > 10 m) are common in highly weathered \n\n\n\n111 \n \n\n        \n \n\ntropical soils (Broedel et al., 2017; Nepstad et al., 1994; Saleska et al., 2007). Even \n\nthough low fine root densities are generally found at great depth (Pierret et al., 2016a), \n\nthey can take up substantial amounts of water needed for tree survival during drought \n\nperiods (McDowell et al., 2008; Nardini et al., 2016). Deep roots can also contribute to \n\nclosing the biogeochemical cycles in tropical forests through nutrient uptake in deep \n\nsoil layers (Bordron et al., 2018; Da Silva et al., 2011; Jobb\u00e1gy  &amp; Jackson, 2004; \n\nLehmann, 2003), which reduces nutrient losses by deep leaching (Laclau et al., 2010; \n\nLehmann  &amp; Schroth, 2003). While many studies show that the role of very deep roots \n\nin tropical forest functioning and productivity has been greatly underestimated \n\n(Freycon et al., 2015; Jackson et al., 2000; Markewitz et al., 2010), as far as we are \n\naware, fine root dynamics and mortality have never been studied at depths > 10 m. \n\nEucalyptus plantations cover more than 20 million hectares and account for around \n\n8% of forest plantations in the world (Booth, 2013). The diversity of Eucalyptus species \n\nplanted in tropical regions has led to a wide range of products and management \n\npractices (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2013). Although many Eucalyptus plantations are \n\nintensively managed to produce raw materials for industry (mainly pulp and paper, but \n\nalso solid-wood products, fiberboards and charcoal for steel production), used as a \n\ndomestic source of energy and also contributes to alleviating poverty in developing \n\ncountries (Cossalter &amp; Pye-Smith, 2003). Most eucalypt plantations are located in \n\nareas with low soil fertility and prolonged drought periods (Keenan et al., 2015). \n\nCoppice management could be an adaptive solution to cope with water deficit in these \n\nplantations, because the sprouts growing on stumps are likely to benefit from the pre-\n\nexisting root system that explores deep soil layers where water availability is generally \n\nhigher than in the topsoil. The effects of clear-cutting on fine root dynamics in coppiced-\n\nmanaged forest plantations are poorly documented and tendencies are not clear. \n\nSequential coring in Brazilian coppiced-managed eucalypt plantations showed that fine \n\nroot density decreased in the 0-1 m soil layer in the first 60 days after harvesting, while \n\nfine root decomposition was accelerated (Mello et al., 2007). Fine root mortality \n\nexceeded fine root production after clear-cutting in Populus stands (Berhongaray et \n\nal., 2015). In contrast, Dickmann et al. (1996) observed little change in fine root \n\nproduction and mortality in the 0-1 m soil layer after clear-cutting in other Populus \n\nstands. While 50% of fine root biomass can be found below a depth of 1 m in tropical \n\neucalypt plantations (Christina et al., 2011b; Laclau et al., 2013a), fine root dynamics \n\n\n\n112 \n \n\n \n \n\nin coppice-managed forests have only been studied in the upper meter of the soil \n\nprofile. \n\nOur study was carried out in Eucalyptus grandis (Hill ex. Maid) stands planted in a \n\nthroughfall exclusion experiment in Brazil (Battie?Laclau et al., 2014b). We aimed to \n\ngain insight into the effects of contrasting rainfall regimes on fine root dynamics in \n\ncoppice-managed eucalypt plantations after tree clear-cutting in very deep tropical \n\nsoils. We put forward the hypothesis that trees invest in belowground biomass in \n\nresponse to throughfall exclusion, in order to increase the exploration of fine roots in \n\ndeep soil layers (H1), and that they adjust fine root traits to increase the specific root \n\narea, in order to capture more resources per gram of C invested in fine roots (H2). In \n\naddition, we put forward the hypothesis that Eucalyptus grandis stands with clear-\n\ncutting and tree regrowth in coppices stimulate fine root growth in both shallow and \n\ndeep soil layers (H3) and increase root mortality throughout the soil profile (H4). \n\n2.2 Materials and Methods \n\n2.2.1 Study site \n\nThe experiments were conducted at the research station owned by the Luiz de Queiroz \n\nCollege of Agriculture (ESALQ) near Itatinga (S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, 23\u00b002?S 48\u00b038?W). \n\nThe study area, located 300 km from the sea, has a relief typical of the S\u00e3o Paulo \n\nWestern Plateau, with a topography varying from flat to hilly (slopes &lt;3%). The altitude \n\nis 850 m, and the climate is humid subtropical with a dry winter (Cwa) according to the \n\nK\u00f6ppen classification. Over the 15 years prior to this study, the mean annual rainfall \n\nwas 1390 mm (with 74% between October and May), and the mean air temperature \n\nand relative humidity were 20\u00b0C and 77%, respectively. A dry and cool (15\u00b0C) season \n\noccurs between June and September. The total rainfall over the study period (from \n\nMay 2015 to July 2018) was 5629 mm. The annual rainfall was 1,557 mm and 2,303 \n\nmm in 2016 and 2017, respectively. The soils are very deep Ferralsols (IUSS Working \n\nGroup WRB, 2015) developed on Cretaceous sandstone. Clay content ranges from \n\n160 mg g-1 soil in the topsoil to about 250 mg g-1 soil at a depth of 15 m, and clay \n\nminerals are mainly kaolinite (Christina et al., 2015). \n\n \n\n\n\n113 \n \n\n        \n \n\n2.2.2 Experimental layout \n\nA split-plot experimental design was set up in June 2010 with a Eucalyptus grandis \n\nclone used in commercial plantations by the Suzano Company (S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil). \n\nThe experimental layout with 6 treatments and 3 blocks was described in detail by \n\nBattie?Laclau et al. (2014b). We studied two treatments out of all those available in the \n\nexperimental design: one treatment with undisturbed rainfall (+W) and one treatment \n\nwith throughfall exclusion (-W), which was equipped with plastic sheets installed since \n\nSeptember 2010, allowing the exclusion of 37% of throughfall (Battie?Laclau et al., \n\n2014b). Treatments -W and +W were used to determine the water deficit effect. The \n\ntrees were planted in June 2010 at a spacing of 3 m x 2 m with a stocking density of \n\n1666 trees per hectare. The plots received a standard commercial fertilizer (at planting: \n\n3.3 g P m-2, 200 g m-2 of dolomitic lime and trace elements; at 3 months of age: 12 g \n\nN m-2, 0.45 mol K m-2 applied as KCl) and herbicides were applied to avoid the \n\npresence of other understory species. In +W and -W, the eucalypt stands were \n\nharvested six years after planting, in June 2016, and the plantation was coppice-\n\nmanaged thereafter. Several new shoots were regenerated from the stumps after the \n\nclear-cut and 1 or 2 shoots per stump were selected to maintain the same stocking \n\ndensity and prevent the growth of additional new shoots. A third treatment served as a \n\ncontrol, with undisturbed rainfall and no harvest (NH), to assess the clear-cutting effect. \n\nTree height and circumference at breast height were recorded each year after the \n\nclear-cut on 36 central trees per plot during the first rotation (May 2010 - June 2016) \n\nand during the second rotation in coppice (starting in June 2016). \n\n2.2.3 Soil water monitoring \n\nThe volumetric soil water content (SWC) was monitored in the +W and -W treatments \n\nthroughout the study period at half-hourly intervals using CS616 probes (Campbell \n\nScientific Inc., Logan, UT, USA) installed at the following depths: 0.15, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, \n\n6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 m, with 3 probes at each depth in block 1. Extractable water \n\n(mm) was calculated as the difference between the current soil water stock (mm) and \n\nthe minimum soil water stock (i.e. lower limit of soil water content in mm) (Granier et \n\nal., 1999). \n\n2.2.4 Deep permanent pits for root phenology observations \n\n\n\n114 \n \n\n \n \n\nBetween February and March 2014, two deep permanent pits were excavated in +W \n\nand -W in block 1 to gain access to the complete soil profile from the top soil down to \n\nthe water table. The pits were 1.5 m in diameter and reached a depth of 17 m and were \n\nlocated between four Eucalyptus trees (Figure 1) at a distance of 90 cm, 90 cm, 130 \n\ncm and 130 cm from each four trees respectively. The pit walls were made of concrete \n\nrings in direct contact with the soil. Clear-colored roofs of the same diameter as the \n\npits were used to prevent light and rain entering the pits. Platforms were set up at two-\n\nmeter intervals in the pits, equipped with artificial lighting and fans used during working \n\nsessions, allowing access and safe work down to the water table (Figure 1). The high \n\ncost of opening up and securing these pits prevented further replications in the other \n\ntwo blocks. However, other measurements, including deep fine root sampling and tree \n\ngrowth were carried out in all three blocks, making it possible to extrapolate some of \n\nthe observations made in the two deep pits. In October 2015, a third pit was excavated \n\nin the non-harvested treatment (NH) down to 3.5 m to determine the clear-cut effect. \n\n \n\n2.2.5 Minirhizotrons  \n\nFine root dynamics were studied through transparent polyvinyl chloride tubes \n\n(length:180  cm; inner diameter: 6.5 cm), commonly called minirhizotrons (Maeght et \n\nal., 2013). In October 2014, twenty-four transparent minirhizotrons were installed using \n\na powerhead drill in the +W and -W treatments of block 1. Outside the pits, three \n\nminirhizotrons were inserted into the soil surface in the same plots a minimum of 10 m \n\napart and at a distance of 90 cm from the trunk (Figure 1). Nine tubes were inserted \n\ninto the pit walls down to a depth of 17 m: two tubes at a depth of 1 m and one tube at \n\ndepths of 3.5, 5.5, 7.5, 9.5, 11.5, 13.5, 15.5 m (Figure 1). The tubes were inserted at a \n\n45-degree angle and allowed an observation depth of 1.3 m below the depth at which \n\nthey were inserted into the soil profile. In October 2015, 3 additional tubes were \n\ninstalled at the soil surface in the +W and -W treatments of blocks 2 and 3 (12 tubes in \n\ntotal) to increase the number of replications in the top meter. In October 2015, seven \n\ntubes were installed in the NH treatments (3 into the soil surface, 2 tubes inserted at \n\ndepths of 1 m and 3.5 m into the pit walls).  \n\n\n\n115 \n \n\n        \n \n\nRoot dynamics were recorded using a circular scanner system (CI-600 Root Growth \n\nMonitoring System, CID, USA). This scanner was selected for the quality of the images \n\nit produces, an essential element for the analysis (Graefe et al., 2008). In order to have \n\na significant stabilization period after soil disturbance from the installation, fine root \n\nmonitoring began eight months after minirhizotron installation (Germon et al., 2016; \n\nGraefe et al., 2008). Eight images (21.59 x 19.56 cm, 100 dpi) per tube (43 tubes in \n\ntotal) were taken every two weeks for more than three consecutive years from May \n\n2015 to July 2018: over one year before the clear-cut and two years after harvesting, \n\nin a coppice. Images were taken at a resolution of 100 dpi, as we obtained the same \n\nroot lengths and diameter compared to images of 300 dpi and 600 dpi, and it was less \n\ntime-consuming in the field than with a higher resolution.  \n\n\n\n116 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - Layout of the position of the pit in the +W treatment of block 1 and distribution of minirhizotron tubes at the soil surface \n(n=3) and in the permanent pit from 1 m (n=2) down 17 m (n=1 per m in depth). The same set-up was used for the -W treatment.\n\n\n\n117 \n \n\n        \n \n\n2.2.6 Root image processing  \n\nWinRhizoTron\u2122 software (R\u00e9gent Instrument Inc., Quebec, Canada) was used to \n\nanalyze more than 24,000 root images taken in the minirhizotrons. This software was \n\nchosen as it allowed the analysis of large number of images and overlayed the images \n\nto visualize the time evolution of the roots throughout the tubes. This manual root \n\nmeasurement program estimated the length and diameter of each root observed and \n\nstored each data item in a text file. By comparing two consecutive images \n\nchronologically, it was possible to estimate changes in root length and phenology \n\nfeatures. Root mortality was evaluated based on the absence of growth over the entire \n\nstudy period up to the last images, when roots turned black and presented clear signs \n\nof decomposition (Germon et al., 2016; Lambais et al., 2017). For each fine root \n\n(diameter &lt;2 mm) we recorded the time of the first appearance, the diameter, the \n\nlength over time, and the time of disappearance. In this study, we considered only root \n\nappearing during the study period.  \n\n2.2.7 Root length calculations \n\nAs described in Germon et al. (2016) and Lambais et al. (2017) the following metrics \n\nwere used to estimate root production and the root elongation rate: living and dead \n\nroot length production (LP, cm m-2) was calculated for each root as the individual root \n\nlength (living or dead) at time t divided by the observed soil area of each image. The \n\ncumulative living or dead root length production (CLP, cm m-2) was calculated \n\nsumming, at each time t, the individual length of all the roots observed, divided by the \n\nobserved soil area of each image. The individual root elongation rate (RER, cm day-1) \n\nwas calculated as the difference in individual root length observed between two \n\nconsecutive sessions (t and t-1) divided by the time in days between t and t-1. The daily \n\nroot elongation rate (DRER, cm m-2 day-1) was calculated by summing, at each time t, \n\neach individual root elongation rate of all the roots observed, divided by the observed \n\nsoil area of each image. The mean root elongation rate (MeanRER, cm day-1) and the \n\nmaximum root elongation rate (MaxRER, cm day-1) were calculated as the mean and \n\nthe maximum of individual root elongation rates considering all the roots growing \n\nduring the study period. LLP, CLP, RER, DRER, MeanRER and MaxRER were \n\nestimated for each treatment (+W, -W and NH), each soil layer and between \n\nconsecutive image sessions over the entire study period. \n\n\n\n118 \n \n\n \n \n\n2.2.8 Root sampling \n\nIn order to check the consistency of fine root dynamics in deep soil layers observed by \n\nthe minirhizotron method, total fine root biomass, fine root length and fine root area \n\ndown to the water table were measured in October 2017, i.e. 1.5 years after the clear-\n\ncut in the coppices (+W and -W) and 7.5 years after planting in NH. Fine roots \n\n(diameter &lt;2 mm) were sampled down to 17 m in the two treatments (+W and -W) \n\ninside the three blocks and in the non-harvested (NH) treatment inside one block. Four \n\ntrees were randomly selected in each plot and soil samples were collected around \n\neach tree between the topsoil and a depth of  2 m and around 2 other trees between \n\ndepths of 2 and 17 m (i.e. 12 sampling points down to a depth of 2 m and 6 further \n\ndown to a depth of 17 m in the +W and -W treatments and 4 sampling points down to \n\na depth of 2 m and 2 down to a depth of 17 m in the NH treatment). At each sampling \n\nposition, soil layers at 0-0.2, 0.2-0.5, 0.5-1, 1-1.5, 1.5-2 m were collected using a \n\ncylindrical auger with an inner diameter of 4.5 cm. The Brazilian \u201ccavadeira\u201d tool, a \n\ncylindrical auger with an inner diameter of 9 cm and a length of 30 cm, was used to \n\ncollect soil cores every 50 cm from 2 m down to a depth of 17 m. From each soil core, \n\nabout 1.5 and 2 kg of soil was collected using the same methodology as described in \n\nGermon et al. (2018) and Christina et al. (2011b). To avoid contamination of the \n\ncollected soil samples, only soil blocks from the inner part of the auger were \n\nconsidered. Total fresh soil mass was measured, and a sub-sample of 5 g was weighed \n\nin the laboratory to estimate the soil water content by drying the sample at 105\u00b0C for \n\n72 h. Each soil sample was identified and stored at 4\u00b0C before being processed a \n\nmaximum of 1 week after sampling. Living roots (i.e. living stele, bright color and \n\nelasticity) and dead roots (i.e. by sight, touch and flotation) > 1 cm long were carefully \n\nseparated by hand after gentle washing away of the soil with tap water on a sieve with \n\na mesh size of 0.5 mm. For the 0-0.2, 0.2-0.5 and 0.5-1 m soil layers, 10 % of the \n\nweight of each soil sample was used to estimate the mass of extremely fine roots (i.e. \n\nlength &lt;1 cm). For the other soil layers 100% of the weight was considered. Living \n\nand dead roots more than 1 cm in length were scanned using a double-sided scanning \n\nprocedure at a resolution of 800 dpi. Then, living roots and dead roots over > 1 cm in \n\nlength and fragments of living and dead roots less than 1 cm in length were dried for \n\n72h at 65\u00b0 C and weighed (\u00b10.1 mg). For the upper layers where only 10% of the \n\nweight of the soil was screened for living and dead roots &lt;1 cm in length, the mass of \n\n\n\n119 \n \n\n        \n \n\nfragments was multiplied by 10 to estimate the mass of fragments of the whole soil \n\nsample. Root weight was then obtained for each soil layer, sampling position, \n\ntreatment and block.  \n\n2.2.9 Root trait calculations \n\nThe fine root scans obtained where analyzed using WinRhizo Version Pro V. 2009c \n\nsoftware (R\u00e9gent Instruments Inc., Quebec, Canada) to estimate root lengths and \n\nareas per soil layer, sampling position, treatments (+W, -W and NH) and blocks. As \n\ndescribed in Germon et al. (2018) the following metrics were used to estimate fine root \n\ntraits. The specific root length (SRL, m g-1, i.e. total length of scanned roots divided by \n\ntheir dry mass) and specific root area (SRA, cm2 g-1, i.e. total area of scanned roots \n\ndivided by their dry mass) were calculated for each soil sample. Fine root mass density \n\n(g kg-1 soil) was calculated as the total root dry mass divided by the dry weight of the \n\nsoil used for root separation. Fine root density (FRD, g dm-3 soil) was obtained by \n\nmultiplying fine root mass density by the soil bulk densities (measured by the standard \n\ncore method down to a depth of 17 m in each treatment). Fine root biomasses (FRB, \n\ng m-2) were calculated in each soil layer multiplying the mean fine root density by the \n\nsoil layer volume (dm3). The root area index (RAI, m2 m-2) was calculated as the \n\nsurface area and length of fine roots divided by the sampled soil area respectively. \n\nFRD, FRB, SRL, SRA, and RAI were obtained for each soil layer from the soil surface \n\ndown to a depth of 17 m, for the sampling position, +W, -W and NH treatments, and \n\nblocks. \n\n2.2.10 Statistical analyses \n\nLinear mixed-effect models were used to test the effect of soil depth, treatment and the \n\ninteraction between depth and treatment on cumulative length production (CLP), root \n\nelongation rate (RER), daily root elongation rate (DRER), mean root elongation rate \n\n(MeanRER), maximum root elongation rate (MaxRER), fine root density (FRD), fine \n\nroot biomass (FRB), specific root length (SRL), specific root area (SRA), root area \n\nindex (RAI) and root diameter for the whole soil profile. Blocks were considered as \n\nrandom effects and residues were modeled by a first-order autoregressive correlation \n\nmodel to account for the correlations between soil depths. Two-way analyses of \n\nvariance (ANOVAs) were used to assess the effect of treatments and blocks for \n\n\n\n120 \n \n\n \n \n\nindividual soil layers on CLP, RER, DRER, MeanRER, MaxRER, FRD, FRB, SRL, \n\nSRA, RAI and root diameter. Measurements within a given soil layer were considered \n\nindependent, since the sampling positions were located near different trees in each \n\ntreatment and plot. The homogeneity of variances was verified, and log-\n\ntransformations were used when the residuals did not follow a normal distribution. \n\nTukey\u2019s post-hoc Honest Significant Difference (HSD) was used to determine the \n\nsignificant differences between treatments. R software version 3.4.4 (Team R 2013) \n\nwas used for all the calculations and statistical analyses with a 5% significance level. \n\nThe \u201clmerTest\u201d package was used to perform the linear mixed-effect models \n\n(Kuznetsova et al., 2017).  \n\n2.3 Results \n\n2.3.1 Tree growth \n\nInitial vertical growth was faster in the coppices than in the replanting: nine months \n\nafter harvesting (in February 2011 for the replanting, and February 2017 for the \n\ncoppices), mean tree height was 1.3 m and 1.5 m in the +W and -W replanted plots \n\nand was 2.7 m and 3.1 m in the +W and -W coppice plots, respectively (Figure 2 - ). \n\nThere were no significant differences in vertical growth between the +W and -W \n\ntreatments for either replanting or coppice in the first 3 years after harvesting.   \n\n\n\n121 \n \n\n        \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 - Vertical growth (m) over the first 2.5 years after harvesting of the previous \nstands for the replanting (June 2010-June 2016) and the coppice (from June 2016) in \nthe undisturbed rainfall plots (+W, blue) and in the plots with 37% of throughfall \nexcluded by plastic sheets (-W, orange). Standard errors are shown (shaded area). \n\n \n\n2.3.2 Volumetric soil water contents (SWCs) \n\nIn both the +W and -W treatments, rainfall events led to large variations in SWC (Figure \n\n3 ). At a depth of 0.5 m, SWC ranged from 5.9% to 15.8% in -W and from 7% to 19.4% \n\nin +W. At a depth of 14 m, SWC ranged from 9.9% to 10.9% in -W and from 11.3% to \n\n18.1% in +W.  Over the study period, throughfall reduction led to a sharp decrease in \n\nSWC, on average, by 12.9 \u00b1 4.9% from the topsoil to a depth of 16 m. The design \n\nturned out to be efficient in mimicking two contrasting rainfall regimes. At the end of \n\nthe rainy season, the mean SWC values of the soil profile in April 2016, i.e. 2 months \n\nbefore the clear-cut, were 12.5% and 14.0% in -W and +W, respectively and in April \n\n2017, i.e. 10 months after the clear-cut, there were 14.4% and 16.2% in -W and +W, \n\nrespectively. After clear-cutting, the soil profiles were recharged with water due to the \n\n\n\n122 \n \n\n \n \n\ninterruption of tree transpiration. In +W, the gravitational soil solutions reached a depth \n\nof 16 m only 10 months after clear-cutting, while in -W they reached a maximum depth \n\nof only 12 m 13 months after clear-cutting. Gravitational soil solutions did not reach the \n\nwater table in -W over the study period (one year before the clear-cut and the first 2 \n\nyears of coppice management).  \n\n2.3.3 Fine root length production  \n\nThe highest cumulative root length production (CLP) over the study period was at \n\ndepths > 4 m, in both +W and -W (Figure 4 ). In \u2013W, CLP reached about 19 m m-2 at a \n\ndepth of 13.5-14.8 m, and only 3.9 m m-2 in the upper 2.3 m of the soil profile. In +W, \n\nthe highest CLP was found in an intermediate soil layer (5.5-6.8 m deep) with a CLP \n\nof 18.9 m m-2. CLP reached about 12 m m-2 in very deep soil layers (13.5-14.8 m deep) \n\nand only about 2 m m-2 in the upper 2.3 m of the soil profile in +W. \n\n\n\n123 \n \n\n        \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3 - Daily rainfall (A) and soil water content (SWC, %) within the soil profiles down to a depth of 16 m in the undisturbed rainfall \nplots (+W, B) and in the plots with 37% of throughfall excluded by plastic sheets (-W, C) from May 2015 to January 2018.

The monitoring of DRER started in May 2015 in the +W and -W plots, and in March 2016 \nin the NH stand, where only the first three layers (0-1.3 m, 1-2.3 m and 3.5-4.5 m) were sampled. \n\n\n\n128 \n \n\n \n \n\n2.3.4 Fine root elongation rates \n\nDaily root elongation rates (DRERs) were highly variable between the soil layer and \n\nthe season, in both +W and -W (Figure 5 ). Fine root growth started in the top soil after \n\nthe clear-cut and occurred more and more deeply over time in +W and -W. The \n\nintensity (measured as the maximum DRER) and the period of fine root growth differed \n\ndepending on soil depth. DRER measured during flushes of root growth was much \n\nlower in the topsoil than at great depth in +W, -W and NH (no observation below 4.8 m \n\nin NH). At a depth of 3.5-4.8 m, flushes of DRER in NH came earlier than in clear-cut \n\nplots. In the coppices, the first flush of DRER occurred about 6 months after clear-\n\ncutting in the topsoil, 12 months after clear-cutting in the 3.5-4.8 m soil layer and 16 \n\nmonths after clear-cutting in the 13.5-14.8 m soil layer, in both +W and -W. Moreover, \n\nDRER sharply increased in the 15.5-16.8 m layer of +W 18 months after clear-cutting.  \n\nDRER peaks ranged from 1.5 cm m-2 day-1 in the topsoil to 94.7 cm m-2 day-1 at a depth \n\nof about 12 m in +W, and from 3.5 cm m-2 day-1 in the topsoil to 83.7 cm m-2 day-1 at a \n\ndepth of about 14 m in -W. The maximum elongation rate of individual roots (MaxRER) \n\nreached 4.3 cm day-1 in -W and 3.0 cm day-1 in +W (Table 1) and was much higher at \n\ngreat depths than in the topsoil (data not shown). DRER values peaked at the end of \n\nthe dry season in all the soil layers at depths > 6 m when SWC decreased in the upper \n\nsoil layers (Figure 3 , Figure 5 ). Thus, DRER values were not necessarily correlated \n\nwith soil water contents for a given soil layer. A synchrony between the decrease in \n\ncumulated extractable water in the topsoil and DRER peaks was observed in -W \n\n(Figure 6 ) after the clear-cut. Successive DRER peaks appeared more and more \n\ndeeply at the end of the dry season when the extractable water stocks in the 0-2 m \n\nlayer fell below about 80 mm.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n129 \n \n\n \n\nTable 1 - Mean diameter (mm), maximum elongation rate of individual roots (cm day-\n1), number of roots observed and root mortality over 3 years in the minirhizotron images \nacross all the soil layers, from the surface to the water table at a depth of about 17 m, \nin the undisturbed rainfall plot (+W) and the plot with 37% of throughfall excluded by \nplastic sheets (-W). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6 - A) Time course of soil extractable water (mm) in soil layers 0-1 m and 1-2 \nm, in the -W (37% of throughfall excluded by plastic sheets) coppice of block 1, from \n\n   +W -W \n\nMean diameter (mm)   0.61 \u00b1 0.31 0.52 \u00b1 0.28  \n\nMaximum root elongation rate (cm day-1)   3.0 4.3  \n\nNumber of roots observed   12,247 14,118 \n\nMortality (%)   7.4  5.7 \n\n\n\n130 \n \n\n \n \n\nMarch 2017 (10 months after the clear-cut) to December 2017.

Fine root densities dropped below a depth of 20 cm, \n\nthen decreased gradually down to the water table in NH, +W and -W. Fine roots where \n\nfound down to 17 m in all treatments. Total fine root biomass down to a depth of 17 m \n\nwas 1,078 g m-2 in NH, 1,017 \u00b1 301 g m-2 in +W and 1,266 \u00b1 363 g m-2 in -W (Table \n\n2). Fine root densities were about 25% higher in -W than in +W and NH in most of the \n\nsoil layers. At depths > 7 m, fine root densities were at least twice as high in -W as in \n\n+W and NH. \n\n\n\n131 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7 - Mean fine root densities down to the root front in the undisturbed rainfall \nplots (+W, blue), in the plots with 37% of throughfall excluded by plastic sheets (-W, \norange) and in the non-harvested plot (NH, gray).

NH was not included in \nstatistical analyses because the three soil coring replicates were located in the same \nplot. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.6 Fine root traits \n\nThe total root area index (RAI) was significantly higher in \u2013W (32.8 m2 m-2) than in +W \n\n(26.5 m2 m-2) (Figure 8 ). Similar RAI values in the NH stand (26.8 m2 m-2) and in the \n\n+W coppice suggested that the effect of clear-cutting on fine root dynamics was low, \n\nin agreement with elongation and mortality rates observed in the upper 4 m on \n\nminirhizotron tubes. RAI in the 0-1 m surface soil layer accounted for only one third of \n\nthe total RAI down to the water table in NH, +W and -W (about 11 m2 m-2 on average). \n\nSignificant differences between +W and -W were found at depths > 5 m (Figure 8 ). In \n\nthe 5-10 m soil layers, RAI was 5.0 m2 m-2 in -W and 2.8 m2 m-2 in +W. At depths > 10 \n\nm, RAI was 3.2 m2 m-2 in -W and only 0.4 m2 m-2 in +W. \n\nIn the NH, +W and -W treatments, depth had little effect on specific root length (SRL), \n\nspecific root area (SRA) and fine root diameter (data not shown). SRL and SRA were \n\nsignificantly higher in -W than in +W, and similar values were observed in +W and NH, \n\nalthough the sampling in NH (pseudo-replication on one block) did not allow a \n\nconfirmation with statistics (Table 2).

Surprisingly, dead fine root length did not \n\nincrease after clear-cutting and did not differ between depths and between the +W and \n\n-W treatments. Dead fine root mass estimated 1.5 years after clear-cutting amounted \n\nto 163.2 g m-2 in +W and 167.9 g m-2 in -W (Table 2). \n\n\n\n134 \n \n\n \n \n\n2.4 Discussion \n\nThe main novelty of our results lies in the first direct observation of fine root phenology \n\nat depths of more than 10 m and derived knowledge raised from a comparison between \n\nthe treatments. The consequences of tree harvesting on fine root dynamics in coppice-\n\nmanaged plantations raise specific questions never studied before along a deep \n\ntropical soil profile. Since the 1980s, the minirhizotron technique has been widely used \n\nto study fine root dynamics and turnover (Graefe et al., 2008; Maeght et al., 2013). \n\nMany studies have shown that the soil environment close to minirhizotrons can be \n\nmodified relative to undisturbed soil (Majdi &amp; Nylund, 1996), which is likely to influence \n\nfine root dynamics. However, in our study the very low root mortality rates after clear-\n\ncutting revealed by minirhizotron monitoring was consistent with the small amounts of \n\ndead fine roots measured by soil coring. Despite some unavoidable limitations, direct \n\nobservations from minirhizotron tubes or field rhizotrons is for now the most accurate \n\nway of studying fine root phenology in situ (Dipesh  &amp; Schuler, 2013; Radville et al., \n\n2016a). \n\n2.4.1 Root behavior in response to drought \n\nThe main purpose of our study was to investigate whether fine roots explore very deep \n\nsoil layers and do so more intensively when trees are subjected to prolonged drought \n\nperiods. This study, carried out in a throughfall exclusion experiment and including a \n\nnon-harvested plot, made it possible to assess the effect of clear-cutting under two \n\ncontrasting rainfall regimes. In agreement with our first hypothesis, Eucalyptus trees \n\nresponded to drought by increasing fine root densities at great depth. Previous studies \n\nin Brazil showed that Eucalyptus trees have the ability to explore very deep layers in \n\nsoils without hindrance to root growth (Christina et al., 2011b; Pinheiro et al., 2016b). \n\nIn a survey of 62 tropical tree species, Markesteijn and Poorter (2009) showed that \n\ntrees increase belowground biomass and the proportion of deep roots in response to \n\ndry conditions. Root growth in deep soil layers can increase the amount of water \n\navailable to sustain tree growth, which could be a key advantage for eucalypt trees in \n\ncoping with severe drought events (Christina et al., 2017b).   \n\nAfter clear-cutting, fine root growth at more than 4 m deep was spectacular at the end \n\nof the dry season, whatever the water supply regime. Lambais et al. (2017) also \n\n\n\n135 \n \n\n \n\nshowed flushes of fine root growth down to a depth of 6 m at the end of dry periods in \n\na Brazilian eucalypt plantation. Fine root growth in deep soil layers was initiated when \n\nthe extractable water content in the 0-2 m soil layer fell below a threshold of about 80 \n\nmm, which suggests that soil water content in a particular soil layer was not the main \n\ndriver of fine root growth. Endogenous and exogenous factors are major drivers of fine \n\nroot phenology (Abramoff &amp; Finzi, 2015; Moroni et al., 2003; Tierney et al., 2003), but \n\nare difficult to disentangle in deep soil layers. The successive flushes of fine root \n\ngrowth from the topsoil to the deepest soil layers at the end of the dry season and the \n\nfirst months after the onset of the rainy season in +W and -W might have resulted from \n\na rapid exhaustion of water resources in the topsoil, inducing tree roots to grow deeper \n\nin the soil (Billings, 2015; Schenk &amp; Jackson, 2002). Furthermore, a strong increase in \n\nsugar sap concentration and sugar allocation belowground has been shown in forests \n\nduring dry periods (Pate &amp; Arthur, 1998; Scartazza et al., 2015), which could be a \n\nphysiological response to a rapid exhaustion of water in the top soil and could help to \n\nexplain the root growth in deep soil layers at the end of dry periods in our study.  \n\nIn agreement with our second hypothesis, Eucalyptus trees facing drought adapted \n\ntheir root morphology to maximize the root surface area to take up limited resources. \n\nSRL and SRA were higher in \u2013W than in +W, which in combination with higher fine root \n\ndensities led to a much higher root area index. In a meta-analysis, Ostonen et al. \n\n(2007b) showed that SRL response to drought varies greatly between species. While \n\nArend et al. (2011) did not observe any significant change in SRL, root area index and \n\nroot tissue density for oak trees (Quercus sp.) exposed to drought, Olmo et al. (2014) \n\nshowed an increase in SRL and root tissue density under drought conditions for 10 \n\ntree species. Eucalyptus grandis trees coped with drought in our experiment by \n\nincreasing their capacity to take up soil resources for a relatively low investment in \n\nbelowground biomass. A large increase in SRL and SRA was recently shown \n\nthroughout deep soil profiles down to 17 m deep for Acacia mangium Wild and E. \n\ngrandis roots in response to the mixture relative to monospecific stands (Germon et \n\nal., 2018). Our study showed that Eucalyptus trees can modify fine root traits to \n\nenhance resource capture and the exploration of very deep soil layers to survive in a \n\ncontext of climate change, which contributes to maintaining water uptake during dry \n\nperiods (Brunner et al., 2015; Christina et al., 2017b).  \n\n \n\n\n\n136 \n \n\n \n \n\n2.4.2 Key role of deep roots in coppice management \n\nContrary to our fourth hypothesis, relatively few roots were lost by mortality (&lt;10% out \n\nof all the roots observed over 3 years), which suggested that most of the root system \n\nremained functional after clear-cutting. The effect of clear-cutting on fine root mortality \n\nremains unclear in coppice-managed forest plantations. Unlike our observations, \n\nsequential coring in the 0-1 m soil layer showed a decrease in fine root density after \n\nharvesting coppice-managed E. grandis stands in Brazil (Mello et al., 2007). Wildy and \n\nPate (2002) also showed high fine root mortality rates after cutting the trees in \n\nplantations of Eucalyptus kochii Maiden &amp; Blakely subsp. plenissima Gardner \n\n(Brooker), but the root system superstructure was sustained down to a depth of at least \n\n4 m. Teixeira et al. (2002) showed from sequential coring in the 0-0.6 m soil layer that \n\nfine-, medium- and coarse-root biomasses increased over time after harvesting \n\ncoppice-managed Eucalyptus urophylla S. T. Blake trees. Using the minirhizotron \n\ntechnique, Dickmann et al. (1996) showed an absence of root mortality for coppice-\n\nmanaged poplar clones. Our study suggested that 6-year-old Eucalyptus grandis trees \n\nhave enough reserves within the root system and the appropriate edaphic surrounding \n\nconditions to maintain the fine root biomass established down to the water table after \n\nclear-cutting, which probably contributed to promoting early shoot growth (Brunner et \n\nal., 2015; Drake et al., 2013).  \n\nFine root growth after clear-cutting started in the topsoil, then continued successively \n\nin deeper and deeper soil layers, which confirmed our third hypothesis, even though \n\nthe lapse of several months after clear-cutting was not expected. This pattern might \n\nhave resulted from high nutrient and water availabilities in the upper layers after \n\nharvesting Eucalyptus stands due to an interruption of tree water uptake and fertilizer \n\napplication (Laclau et al., 2010). The asynchrony within the root system, delaying root \n\ngrowth in deep soil layers, might be a strategy for maximizing the water and nutrient \n\nuptake needed to meet the high demand of these fast-growing trees. Root growth \n\noccurred at a depth of 14 m less than one year after clear-cutting of coppice-managed \n\nE. grandis trees, while the maximum depth reached by E. grandis roots one year after \n\nplanting is about 7 m in very deep soils (Christina et al., 2011b; Laclau et al., 2013a). \n\nDeep roots can provide access to large amounts of water stored in the subsoil after \n\nclear-cutting and small fine root densities in deep soil layers can be sufficient to take \n\n\n\n137 \n \n\n \n\nup substantial amounts of water (Christina et al., 2017b). Low fine root mortality rates \n\nafter clear-cutting suggest that coppice-management of Eucalyptus plantations might \n\nbe a promising option for coping with water scarcity, since the pre-existing root system \n\ncan provide access to water stored throughout deep soil profiles.  \n\n \n\n2.4.3 Carbon sequestration and implication for the management of eucalypt \n\nplantations  \n\nSurprisingly, cutting the trees did not lead to an increase in root mortality throughout \n\nthe soil profile, whatever the water supply regime. Fine roots play an active role in \n\ncarbon (C) cycling in forest ecosystems, through respiratory processes, exudation and \n\nroot mortality (Balesdent &amp; Balabane, 1996; Marsden et al., 2008; Strand et al., 2008). \n\nThe consequences of deep rooting on subsoil C stocks in tropical planted forests and \n\nother forest ecosystems remain poorly known (Gao et al., 2018; Harper &amp; Tibbett, \n\n2013; Meyer et al., 2018; Nepstad et al., 1994). On the one hand, the supply of fresh \n\ncarbon might promote the activity of microbes and affect the stability of pre-existing \n\norganic matter through a \u201cpriming effect\u201d (Derrien et al., 2014a; Fontaine et al., 2007; \n\nKuzyakov et al., 2000). Promoting the mineralization of ancient C would result in high \n\nemissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) under aerobic conditions and of methane (CH4) \n\nunder anaerobic conditions. However, a complementary study in our plots showed that \n\nCO2 and CH4 emissions did not increase significantly after clear-cutting in the coppice-\n\nmanaged stands compared to the non-harvested stand (Germon et al. in prep.). Gas \n\nemission rates after clear-cutting in our experiment were therefore consistent with the \n\nlow rates of root mortality observed. On the other hand, deep roots might also \n\ncontribute to sequestrating large amounts of C in soil. Total below-ground carbon \n\nallocations account for about 20-30% of gross primary production in Eucalyptus \n\nplantations (Epron et al., 2012; Nouvellon et al., 2012a; Ryan et al., 2010). Fine root \n\nelongation rates were higher at great depth compared to the topsoil, with an increase \n\nin fine root density after the clear-cut in very deep horizons. Moreover, microbial \n\nbiomass is lower in deep soil layers than in the topsoil, which in combination with \n\noxygen limitations could enhance C sequestration as a result of low mineralization \n\nrates (Rumpel &amp; K\u00f6gel-Knabner, 2011; Taylor et al., 2002). C from roots is generally \n\nretained more in the soil than C from aboveground litter, which is more affected by \n\n\n\n138 \n \n\n \n \n\nphysicochemical processes and also due to structural composition differences \n\nbetween leaves and roots (Menichetti et al., 2015; Rasse et al., 2005; Schmidt et al., \n\n2011). Further studies are needed to assess whether the management of Eucalyptus \n\nplantations in very deep soils could be an effective option to help mitigate the increase \n\nin CO2 in the atmosphere.  \n\n2.5 Conclusions \n\nThe fine root phenology of coppice-managed Eucalyptus trees under contrasting water \n\nsupply regimes revealed unexpected low rates of root mortality. The early growth of \n\nthe sprouts after cutting the trees benefited from the root system established over the \n\nprevious rotation cycle, and the asynchrony of fine root growth depending on depth \n\nhighlighted tree plasticity in response to soil conditions. Establishing deep root systems \n\nin tropical planted forests could help trees withstand the long drought periods expected \n\nunder climate change in many tropical regions. Our study suggested that coppice \n\nmanagement might be an interesting option in tropical Eucalyptus plantations, both to \n\nimprove tree tolerance to drought and store carbon at great depth in the soil.  \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThe study was funded by S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP, Project \n\n2015/24911-8), Centre de cooperation Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour \n\nle D\u00e9veloppement (CIRAD) and S\u00e3o Paulo University.

Fine root biomass and \n\nroot area index increased about 25 and 24 % respectively in the throughfall exclusion \n\nplot compared to the control plot down to a depth of 17 m. The changes in root \n\ndistribution occurred mainly at depth > 7m. Therefore, the huge soil volume explored \n\nby fine roots might lead to significant CO2, N2O and CH4 productions within the entire \n\nrooting soil profile. A deeper root system could increase greenhouse gases emissions \n\nthrough an increase in production, respiration, exudation and decomposition \n\nprocesses. \n\nThe central objective of this following chapter is to assess the effect of clear-cutting \n\nand drought on greenhouse gases production throughout deep soil profiles down to \n\nthe water table in coppice-managed Brazilian eucalypt plantations. These effects were \n\nmonitored before and after trees harvest in a coppice-managed Eucalyptus grandis \n\nplantation under two contrasting water supply regimes.  \n\nThis chapter presents the results of 1.8 years of greenhouse gases monitoring and is \n\ntitled is \u201cConsequences of clear-cutting and drought on CO2, CH4 and N2O productions \n\nthroughout deep soil profiles in coppice-managed eucalypt plantations\u201d.

Our study aimed to \n\nassess the effects of clear-cutting and drought on the temporal variability of CO2, CH4 \n\nand N2O fluxes throughout very deep soil profiles in Brazilian coppice-managed \n\neucalypt plantations. CO2, CH4 and N2O surface effluxes at soil surface were \n\nmeasured over three years using the closed-chamber method in a throughfall \n\nexclusion experiment comparing stands with 37% of throughfall exclusion (-W) and \n\nstands without rain exclusion (+W). CO2, CH4 and N2O concentrations in the soil were \n\nmeasured from two permanent pits down to a depth of 15.5 m in -W and +W, as well \n\nas down to a depth of 4 m in a non-harvested control plot (NH). Measurements were \n\ncarried out every 2 weeks over 3 months before clear-cutting, then over 19 months in \n\ncoppice. CO2, CH4 and N2O effluxes were not significantly different between -W and \n\n+W and did not change after clear-cutting in the coppice-managed stands compared \n\nto non-harvested stand. CO2 and CH4 concentrations greatly increased with depth and \n\nN2O concentrations remained roughly constant from the soil surface down to a depth \n\nof 15.5 m. Mean CO2 and N2O concentrations in -W were 20.7% and 7.6% lower than \n\nin +W, respectively, and CH4 concentrations in -W where 44.4% higher than in +W \n\nthroughout the soil profiles. A diffusivity model showed that CO2, N2O and CH4 \n\nproduction and consumption occurred at great depths and were similar in +W, -W and \n\nNH plots. Clear-cutting did not increase CO2, CH4 and N2O effluxes and productions, \n\nwhatever the water supply regime. Our study suggests that the consequences of \n\nchanges in rainfall regimes and silvicultural practices on greenhouse gas emissions \n\ncould be minor in tropical eucalypt plantations. \n\n  \n\n\n\n156 \n \n\n \n \n\n3.1 Introduction  \n\nClimate changes are expected to increase the contrast between dry and wet seasons \n\nin tropical and subtropical regions (Dai, 2011; He &amp; Soden, 2017; Solomon et al., \n\n2009). Climate models predict longer and more severe seasonal droughts in the future, \n\nas well as more frequent extreme rainfall events during rainy seasons (Chen et al., \n\n2017). Changes in precipitation regimes may also have important feedback effects on \n\nclimate through a modification of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous \n\noxide (N2O) fluxes in forest soils (Davidson et al., 2004; Hashimoto et al., 2007). \n\nUnderstanding how precipitation changes, and especially extended drought periods, \n\ninfluence greenhouse gas effluxes in forest soils is crucial to improve the prediction of \n\nterrestrial biosphere models.  \n\nThe balance between production and consumption of CO2, CH4 and N2O in forest soils \n\ncan be greatly affected by precipitation changes (Davidson et al., 2000b). Throughfall \n\nexclusion in tropical and subtropical forests has either decreased (Cleveland et al., \n\n2010) or increased (Van Straaten et al., 2011; Wood &amp; Silver, 2012) soil CO2 \n\nemissions, either increased consumption (Wood &amp; Silver, 2012) and production \n\n(Catt\u00e2nio et al., 2002) of CH4 and either lowered (Davidson et al., 2004) and increased \n\n(Catt\u00e2nio et al., 2002) soil N2O emissions. An increase in soil water contents inhibits \n\ngas diffusion within soil profiles to the atmosphere as well as microbial production and \n\nconsumption of greenhouse gases (Qi et al., 2018; Sotta et al., 2007). Root:shoot ratios \n\ngenerally increase in response to dry conditions as well as the proportion of deep roots \n\n(Germon et al., 2019; Markesteijn &amp; Poorter, 2009), which can increase CO2 production \n\ndue to higher root respiration.  \n\nProduction of greenhouse gases by soil microorganisms and roots can change rapidly \n\ntemporally and spatially, which makes modelling efforts challenging (Courtois et al., \n\n2018; Drewitt et al., 2005). While most studies dealing with soil greenhouse gases \n\neffluxes address the spatial and temporal variations, the vertical distribution of soil \n\nrespiration is little documented in very deep soils (Drewitt et al., 2005). Trees with roots \n\nat depths of more than 10 m are common in tropical forests (Broedel et al., 2017; \n\nNepstad et al., 1994; Saleska et al., 2007). In a Brazilian Amazon forest, the \n\nconsumption of CH4 occurred mainly in the upper 10 cm, the production of N2O mainly \n\nin the 0-25 cm soil layer whereas CO2 was produced down to at least a depth of 11 m \n\n\n\n157 \n \n\n \n\n(Davidson et al., 2004) . In another Amazonian forest, CO2 production in the 0.5-3 m \n\nsoil layer accounted for 17 % of the total soil CO2 production (Sotta et al., 2007). Even \n\nif microbial activity is low in deep soil layers (Fontaine et al., 2007), the huge soil \n\nvolume explored by fine roots might lead to non-neglectable CO2, N2O and CH4 \n\nproductions.  \n\nFast-growing Eucalyptus plantations cover more than 20 million hectares  and are \n\nexpanding rapidly to produced raw material for the industry (paper, wood panels, and \n\nbiofuel) as well as firewood and charcoal in developing countries (Booth, 2013). In \n\nBrazil, Eucalyptus plantations cover about 5.6 million hectares and are mainly \n\nestablished on deep soils with low fertility and many plantation areas are subjected to \n\nprolonged drought periods (Keenan et al., 2015). The management of Eucalyptus \n\nplantations through coppice has been practiced by forestry companies due to lower \n\nproduction costs, shorter rotations and faster financial returns compared to replanted \n\nstands (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2013). The root system established during previous rotations \n\nmakes possible a rapid regrowth from the stump after harvesting. Eucalyptus fine roots \n\ncan explore rapidly after planting both the superficial soil layers and very deep soil \n\nhorizons (Germon et al., 2019; Laclau et al., 2013) and allocate about 30% of the gross \n\nprimary productivity belowground, for root growth, root respiration and C exudation \n\n(Epron et al., 2012; Nouvellon et al., 2012; Ryan et al., 2010). Coppice management \n\nconstitutes an advantage over sites with pronounced stress conditions, as the \n\nestablished root system preserves carbon for the next generation. However, removing \n\nthe aboveground parts of trees has a great impact on carbon balance and greenhouses \n\ngases emissions of the ecosystem. Clear-cutting  increases the solar radiation \n\ntransmitted to the soil, raising the soil temperature and soil water contents through an \n\ninterruption of stand transpiration (Londo et al., 1999; Mello et al., 2007). This may \n\ninduce an increase in microbial activity, the decomposition of harvest residues left at \n\nthe soil surface and enhance fine root mortality and decomposition (Mello et al., 2007; \n\nParfitt et al., 2001).As far as we know, concentrations of greenhouse gas in deep soil \n\nlayers have never been quantified in tropical planted forests in response to throughfall \n\nexclusion and coppice management. \n\nOur study aimed to assess the consequences of contrasting rainfall regimes on CO2, \n\nCH4 and N2O fluxes throughout very deep tropical soils in coppice-managed \n\nEucalyptus grandis (Hill ex. Maid) stands after clear-cutting. We put forward three \n\n\n\n158 \n \n\n \n \n\nhypotheses: (H1) throughfall exclusion lower soil water contents, which increases gas \n\ndiffusivity and modify greenhouse gases production and consumption, (H2) throughfall \n\nexclusion increases the partition of C to deep roots, which increases the production of \n\nCO2 in deep soil layers, and (H3) fine root mortality and slash decomposition after \n\nharvesting Eucalyptus grandis trees managed in coppice increase substrate availability \n\nfor microbes throughout the soil profile, which increases CO2, CH4 and N2O effluxes at \n\nsoil surface.  \n\n3.2 Materials and Methods \n\n3.2.1 Study site \n\nOur study was carried out at the research station owned by the Luiz de Quieroz College \n\nof Agriculture (ESALQ) near Itatinga (S\u00e3o Paulo state, Brazil, 23\u00b002?S 48\u00b038?W), at an \n\naltitude of 850 m. The relief is typical of the S\u00e3o Paulo Western Plateau, with a \n\ntopography varying from flat to hilly (slopes &lt;3%). The soils are very deep Ferralsols \n\naccording to the ISS Working Group WRB (2015) developed on Cretaceous \n\nsandstone. Clay contents range from 160 mg g-1 in the topsoil to about 250 mg g-1 at \n\na depth of 15 m (Christina et al., 2015). The local climate is humid subtropical (Cwa \n\naccording to the K\u00f6ppen classification) with a rainy season from October to May and \n\na dry and slightly cold season from June to September. Over the last 15 years, the \n\nmean air temperature was 20\u00b0C, the relative humidity was 77% and the mean annual \n\nprecipitation was 1390 mm.  \n\n3.2.2 Experimental Layout \n\nA split-splot experimental design was installed on 2 hectares in June 2010, with the \n\nplanting of a Eucalyptus grandis clone used in commercial plantations (Suzano \n\nCompany). Three fertilization regimes and two rainfall regimes were compared in 3 \n\nblocks to gain insight into the interaction between tree nutrition and water availability \n\non tree functioning (Battie?Laclau et al., 2014a; Christina et al., 2015; Christina et al., \n\n2018; Ployet et al., 2019). The experimental layout was described in detail in Battie?\n\nLaclau et al. (2014b). Each plot was made of 144 trees (12 rows with 12 trees per row, \n\nspacing 3 x 2 m) and each experimental unit consisted of 36 trees (excluding 3 buffer \n\n\n\n159 \n \n\n \n\nrows to avoid bordure effect). We studied two treatments out of the 6 treatments in the \n\nexperimental design as well as a non-harvested control plot in the same stand: \n\n\u2022 -W: plots were equipped with plastic sheets in September 2010 to exclude 37% \n\nof throughfall and fertilizers were applied to avoid any nutritional limitation of \n\ntree growth. \n\n\u2022 +W: undisturbed rainfall and same fertilization as in -W plots \n\n\u2022 NH: undisturbed rainfall and same fertilization as in -W and +W plots. Contrary \n\nto -W and +W, the trees were not harvested in June 2016. \n\nTrees were planted in June 2010 and received at planting 3.3 g P m-2 and 200 g m-2 of \n\ndolomitic lime and trace elements. At 3 months of age, 0.45 mol K m-2 were applied as \n\nKCl and 12 g N m-2. These fertilizers inputs are not limiting for the tree growth (Laclau \n\net al., 2009). Herbicides were applied to avoid the presence of understory species. The \n\nEucalyptus stands were harvested six years after planting, in June 2016, and coppice-\n\nmanaged thereafter. Several new shoots were regenerated from the stumps after the \n\nclear-cut and 1 or 2 shoots per stump were selected to maintain the same stocking \n\ndensity and prevent the growth of additional new shoots.  \n\n3.2.3 Soil water monitoring and soil bulk density \n\nBetween February and March 2014, two deep permanent pits were excavated in the \n\n+W and -W treatments to set up sensors and to measure soil properties from the top \n\nsoil down to the water table (Germon et al., 2019). The volumetric soil water content \n\n(SWC, m3 water m-3 soil) was monitored through the study period at half-hourly \n\nintervals using CS616 probes (Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT, USA). Probes were \n\ninstalled in the +W and -W treatments at a depth of 0.15, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, \n\n14 and 16 m, with 3 probes at each depth in block 1. Soil bulk densities were measured \n\nby the standard core method down to a depth of 17 m in the +W and -W treatments. \n\nThe total porosity was calculated from bulk density: \n\n????? ???????? = 1 ?\n??\n\n??\n \n\nwhere BD is measured bulk density and PD is an assumed particle density of 2.65 g \n\ncm-3 (Davidson et al., 2006; Oerter et al., 2018; Sotta et al., 2007). The soil water \n\ncontent was expressed as the percentage of water filled pore space (WFPS, %) and \n\n\n\n160 \n \n\n \n \n\nwas calculated for each depth as the volumetric water content (SWC) divided by the \n\ntotal porosity. \n\n3.2.4 Gas sampling at the soil surface \n\nSoil CO2 efflux was monitored in the +W and -W treatments using a dynamic closed-\n\npath Li8100 system equipped with a 20 cm diameter Li8100-103 respiration chamber \n\n(LiCor Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). 54 PVC collars (9 per plot in treatments +W and -W \n\nand 3 blocks) were installed in May 2010 to sample different distances from the tree \n\n(Figure 1 ), using the methodology described in Nouvellon et al. (2008). Soil CO2 efflux \n\nwas measured every 14 days over 3 years from December 2014 to December 2017, \n\nwhich represented 1.5 year before the clear-cut and 1.5 year after the clear-cut. In \n\nOctober 2016, 27 PVC collars were installed in the NH treatment to measure soil CO2 \n\nefflux from November 2016 to December 2017. \n\nSoil CO2, N2O and CH4 fluxes were measured simultaneously to the Li8100 \n\nmeasurements in the same plots. Chamber (diameter 40 cm, height 10 cm) collars \n\nwere permanently set up in the +W, -W and NH plots (Metay et al., 2007). Four anchors \n\nwere placed randomly in each plot at four distance from the trees, one month before \n\nthe beginning of greenhouse gas efflux measurements (Figure 1 ). Anchors were \n\ntemporarily removed during stand harvest, then they were returned to the same \n\nlocation. Measurements were made every 14 days over one year from March 2015 to \n\nMarch 2016, then once a month between April 2016 and December 2017. Soil CO2, \n\nN2O and CH4 fluxes were monitored over 3 months before the clear-cut and over 19 \n\nmonths after the clear-cut in the coppice-managed treatments +W and -W, as well as \n\nover 22 months in the NH treatment. The chamber atmosphere was sampled 4 \n\nconsecutive times (0, 10 min, 20 min and 30 min after closure) during this period with \n\n5 mL syringes previously purged.  \n\nGas samples were analyzed using electron capture gas chromatography (CPG-ECD, \n\nat the Plant Production Department - FCA, UNESP, Botucatu, Brazil). Gas samples \n\nwere analyzed in less than 36 hours after sampling (the validity of this period was \n\nverified in a preliminary study). Concentrations of CO2, N2O and CH4 in soil air were \n\ncalculated by comparison of integrated peak areas of samples with standard gases, \n\n\n\n161 \n \n\n \n\nwhich were used to make a four-point calibration. Calibration was done for each \n\nsampling date. More than 4000 gas samples have been analyzed in our study. \n\nGas fluxes at the soil surface were calculated from the following equation: \n\n?? =  \n?[???]\n\n??\n\u00d7\n\n1\n\n?\n\u00d7\n\n??\n\n??\n \n\nwhere Fs is gas flux (\u00b5mol m-2 s-1 or nmol m-2 s-1), \n?[???]\n\n??\n is the slope of the regression \n\nline of gas concentrations (ppm or ppb) over time (s), S is the chamber surface (m2), \n\nV the chamber volume (m3), P the atmospheric pressure (Pa), R the perfect gas \n\nconstant (8.3143 J K-1 mol-1) and T the temperature (K). \n\nCumulative soil CO2, N2O and CH4 fluxes were estimated for each PVC collar and each \n\nchamber using linear interpolations of fluxes between each measurement date for all \n\ntreatments.  Gana et al. (2018) checked in a nearby eucalypt stand the validity of this \n\nmethod for CO2 effluxes in comparison with monitoring every hour using automatic Li-\n\ncor chambers. Annual estimates of gas fluxes were made for each individual flux \n\nchamber.     \n\n \n\n3.2.5 Gas sampling at different soil depths \n\nThe permanent pits in the +W and -W treatments were 1.5 m in diameter and reached \n\na depth of 17 m (Figure 1 ). They were maintained by concrete rings to reduce potential \n\nsoil collapse and disturbances of the soil system. To prevent light and rain entering the \n\npits, clear-colored roofs of the same diameter as the pits were used. Platforms were \n\nset up at two-meter intervals in the pits, equipped with artificial lighting and fans used \n\nduring working sessions, allowing access and safe work down to the water table \n\n(Germon et al., 2019). The high cost of opening and securing these pits prevented \n\nfurther replications in the other two blocks. However, other measurements, including \n\nCO2, N2O and CH4 effluxes, were made in the three blocks, making it possible to \n\nextrapolate some of the observations made in the two deep pits. In October 2015, a \n\nthird pit was excavated in the non-harvested treatment (NH) down to a depth of 3.5 m \n\nto study the clear-cut effect. \n\n\n\n162 \n \n\n \n \n\nSoil CO2, N2O and CH4 concentrations were measured at a depth of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 3.5, \n\n7.5, 11.5 and 15.5 m (3 repetitions per depth, Figure 1 ) in the +W and -W treatments \n\nand at 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 3.5 m depths (3 repetitions per depth) in the NH treatment. \n\nSoil-gas samples were collected using a passive method: a 20 mL syringe was driven \n\ninto the ground at 1.2 m from the lateral pit wall for each sampling depth (to be sure to \n\nsample an undisturbed soil area) and remained permanently in the soil throughout the \n\nstudy period (Chapuis-Lardy et al., 2009; Metay et al., 2007). Additional 1 m deep pits \n\n(3 per treatment in +W, -W and NH) were excavated to collect soil-gas samples at \n\ndepths of 0.1, 0.5 and 1 m to increase the number of replications in the top meter, and \n\nthen backfilled with soil horizons in their correct order. Soil gas was pumped from the \n\ninside of the pit (for permanent deep pits) or from the soil surface into a 5 mL syringe \n\n(after several \u201cmicropurge\u201d to prevent gas sample from contamination). This equipment \n\nwas installed into the soil more than one month prior to the first soil gas measurement \n\nto allow for passive diffusion from the soil into the syringe. Soil CO2, N2O and CH4 \n\nconcentrations were measured on the same days as CO2, N2O and CH4 effluxes at the \n\nsoil surface from March 2016 to December 2017: over 3 months before clear-cutting \n\nand 19 months after the clear-cut in the coppice-managed +W and -W treatments and \n\nover 22 months in the NH treatment. \n\n\n\n163 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - A) Layout of the position of the pit in the +W treatment of block 1 and distribution of the PVC collars for closed-path Li8100 \nLicor system (n=9) and anchors for closed-chamber method (n=4). B) Layout of the position of the syringes for soil-gas sampling from \nthe soil surface at 0.1, 0.5 and 1 m (n=3 per depth) and in the permanent pit at the depths of 3.5, 7.5, 11.5 and 15.5 m (n=3 per \ndepth). The same set-up was used in the -W treatment.  The photographs show a view from the bottom of each pit, the top of one pit \nand the tube used to sample soil gas.  \n\n\n\n164 \n \n\n \n \n\n3.2.6 Modeling effective diffusivity of CO2, N2O and CH4 1 \n\nGas production at each depth was calculated as the difference between the flux across 2 \n\nsoil layers (Risk et al., 2002). To estimate soil gas fluxes within the soil profile we used 3 \n\nCO2, N2O and CH4 concentrations, soil physical properties and soil textural properties. 4 \n\nInterlayer flux was determined from Fick\u2019s Lax in one dimension. 5 \n\n?(???) = ??? \n??\n\n??\n 6 \n\nwhere Ds is the gas diffusivity in the soil, C is the concentration and z is the depth. This 7 \n\napproach assumes that the concentration profile is momentarily at steady state. This 8 \n\nmodel provides an estimate of the production that occurred below the depth of the 9 \n\ncalculated flux. The flux rates from soil gas concentrations depend on the soil gas 10 \n\ndiffusion coefficient. Effective diffusivity was estimated using the model of Moldrup et 11 \n\nal. (1999), recommended for soils with clay contents &lt;30%: 12 \n\n??\n\n??\n=  \n\n2.5\n\n??\n 13 \n\nwhere Do is the diffusivity of gas in air assumed to be 0.138, 0.144 and 0.195 cm2 s-1 14 \n\nfor CO2, N2O and CH4, respectively, according to Massman (1998),  is air-filled 15 \n\nporosity and ? is the total porosity (Moldrup et al., 1999; Oerter et al., 2018). Air-filled 16 \n\nporosity was calculated by difference between total porosity and soil volumetric water 17 \n\ncontent at each depth.     18 \n\n3.2.7 Statistical analyses  19 \n\nLinear mixed-effect models were used to test the effects of soil depth, treatment (+W 20 \n\nand -W) and the interaction between depth and treatment on CO2, N2O and CH4 21 \n\nconcentrations in soil air, as well as CO2, N2O and CH4 productions for the whole soil 22 \n\nprofile at each measurement date. Blocks were considered as random effects and 23 \n\nresidues were modelled by a first-order autoregressive correlation model to account 24 \n\nfor the correlations between soil depths. Two-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) 25 \n\nwere used to assess the effect of treatments (+W, -W and NH) for individual soil layers 26 \n\non CO2, N2O and CH4 soil concentrations. CO2, N2O and CH4 fluxes at the soil surface 27 \n\nwere tested for statistical significance at each measurement date. The same analysis 28 \n\n\n\n165 \n \n\n \n\nwas made for cumulative CO2, N2O and CH4 fluxes over the study period. The 29 \n\nhomogeneity of variances was verified, and log-transformation were used when the 30 \n\nresiduals did not follow a normal distribution. Tuckey\u2019s post-hoc Honest Significant 31 \n\nDifference (HSD) were used to determine the significant differences between 32 \n\ntreatments. Linear regressions were used to identify the correlation between CO2 33 \n\nproduction and root biomass as well as soil CO2 effluxes measured with the closed 34 \n\nchamber method and the close-path Li8100 system. R software version 3.4.4 (Team 35 \n\nR 2013) was used for all the calculations and statistical analyses with a level of 36 \n\nsignificance of 5%. The lmerTest package was used to perform the linear mixed-effect 37 \n\nmodels (Kuznetsova et al., 2017). 38 \n\n3.3 Results 39 \n\n3.3.1 Water filled pore space (WFPS) 40 \n\nWFPS values throughout the soil profiles were strongly influenced by throughfall 41 \n\nexclusion and reflected the distribution of rainfall events (Figure 2 ). Mean WFPS from 42 \n\nMarch 2016 to December 2017 was 38.5 \u00b1 12.7 % in the +W treatment and 31.7 \u00b1 8.5 43 \n\n% in the -W treatment. At a depth of 0.5 m, WFPS ranged from 15.6% to 41.1% in the 44 \n\n+W treatment and from 14.0% to 34.0% in the -W treatment. At a depth of 14 m, WFPS 45 \n\nranged from 34.7% to 53.7% in treatment +W and from 28.5% to 30.9% in treatment -46 \n\nW. At the end of the rainy season, mean WFPS in the 0-14 m soil layer were 37.9% 47 \n\nand 30.7% in the +W and -W treatments, just before the clear-cut (June 2016), 48 \n\nrespectively, and 42.1% and 36.1%, 1 year after the clear-cut (June 2017). The soil 49 \n\nprofiles were refilled with water after the clear-cut as a result of an interruption in tree 50 \n\ntranspiration in coppice-managed stands.

Soil CO2 effluxes over the study period ranged from 1.5 to 7.0 \u00b5mol m-2 s-\n\n1 in treatment -W and from 1.5 to 7.3 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1 in treatment +W.

At a depth of \n\n0.1 m, CO2 concentrations ranged from 2438 to 9560 ppm in treatment -W (4774 ppm \n\non average), and from 1700 to 9844 ppm in treatment +W (4178 ppm on average). At \n\na depth of 15.5 m, CO2 concentrations ranged from 9174 to 21784 ppm in treatment -\n\nW (13467 ppm on average), and from 13220 to 23938 ppm in treatment +W (18303 \n\nppm on average).  \n\n \n\nMean CH4 concentrations from March 2016 to December 2017 were 37.5% lower in \n\ntreatment +W than in treatment -W across the sampling depths (Figure 5  C, D).

CO2 and N2O productions at depths of more than 4 m were close \n\nto 0 throughout the study period, and CH4 productions were generally slightly positive \n\nin very deep soil layers (Figure 6). At a depth of 0.1 m, CO2 production ranged from \n\n0.4 to 4.6 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1 in treatment -W and from 0.9 to 6.7 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1 in treatment \n\n+W, CH4 production ranged from -26.4 to 21.3 nmol m-2 s-1 in treatment -W and from -\n\n41.1 to 5.2 nmol m-2 s-1 in treatment +W, and N2O production ranged from -5.2 to 3.8 \n\nnmol m-2 s-1 in treatment -W and from -4.4 to 6.4 nmol m-2 s-1 in treatment +W. At a \n\ndepth of 11.5 m, CO2 production ranged from -0.06 to 0.08 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1 in -W and from \n\n-0.04 to 0.03 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1 in +W, CH4 production ranged from -0.63 to 1.41 nmol m-2 s-\n\n1 in -W and from -0.13 to 0.41 nmol m-2 s-1 in +W and N2O production ranged from -\n\n0.20 to 0.04 nmol m-2 s-1 in -W and from -0.04 to 0.04 nmol m-2 s-1 in +W.  CO2 \n\nproduction and fine root biomass (diameter &lt;2 mm) were strongly positively correlated \n\nacross the soil layers (r2= 0.76 for +W and r2= 0.56 for -W) (Appendix 2 ). \n\nWhatever the soil layer, cumulated CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes over the first year after \n\nthe clear-cut in coppice-managed stands were not significatively different in treatments \n\n+W and -W (Figure 7 ). The cumulative CO2 flux through the 0.1-0.5 m soil layer \n\naccounted for 76% and 53% of the cumulative CO2 efflux at the soil surface in \n\ntreatments +W and -W, respectively. The cumulative CH4 flux through this soil layer \n\naccounted for 55% and 53% of the cumulative CH4 efflux at the soil surface in \n\ntreatments +W and -W, respectively. The cumulative N2O flux through this soil layer \n\naccounted for 80% and 58% of the cumulative N2O efflux at the soil surface in \n\ntreatments +W and -W, respectively. The CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes through the soil \n\nlayers dropped below a depth of 1 m. The small CO2, CH4 and N2O productions in deep \n\nsoil layers corresponded to high soil water contents (Figure 8 ). The temporal variability \n\nof CO2, CH4 and N2O production was high when the water filled pore space was below \n\na threshold of 40%, with either CH4 consumption or production in the upper soil layers \n\ndepending on the sampling period.  \n\n\n\n178 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n179 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 6: Time course of CO2 production (\u00b5mol m-2 s-1) calculated with the diffusivity model within the soil profile down to a depth of \n16 m (A) in the undisturbed rainfall treatment (+W) and (B) in the treatment with 37% of throughfall excluded by plastic sheets (-W), \nfrom March 2016 to December 2017.

While CO2 and \n\nCH4 concentrations increased sharply with depth throughout the soil profile, N2O \n\nconcentrations where much less influenced by the depth. A strong increase in soil CO2 \n\nconcentration with depth has been reported in deep tropical soils with an order of \n\nmagnitude consistent with our results. Soil CO2 concentrations reached 80,000 ppm in \n\na Brazilian Amazon rainforest (Davidson et al., 2004; Sotta et al., 2007; Trumbore et \n\nal., 1995), 30,000 ppm in a tropical rainforest in Costa Rica (Schwendenmann &amp; \n\nVeldkamp, 2006) and 140,000 ppm in an agroforestry system in Indonesia (Van \n\nStraaten et al., 2010). The highest soil CO2 concentration reached 25,000 ppm in our \n\nstudy at a depth of 15.5 m. Physical, chemical, mineralogical and biological properties \n\ncan change considerably throughout deep soil profiles (Davidson et al., 2006; Fierer \n\net al., 2003; Oerter et al., 2018; Wiaux et al., 2015). In our study, higher soil water \n\ncontents in deep soil layers than in the topsoil led to a low proportion of air-filled pore \n\nspace in deep soil layers and therefore a slow diffusion rate of the greenhouse gases \n\nto the atmosphere. Eucalyptus fine roots have been found down to the water table at \n\na depth of 17 m in our experiment (Germon et al., 2019), and the deepest roots have \n\nan important functional role to withdraw water during dry periods (Christina et al., \n\n2018). The sharp increase in CO2 concentrations with soil depth might therefore reflect \n\nboth CO2 production in deep soil layers through root respiration and microbial \n\ndecomposition of organic matter (dead roots, exudates, dissolved organic matter,\u2026) \n\nand slow upward diffusion rates of gas in soil layers with a high proportion of water-\n\nfilled pore space (Davidson et al., 2004; Schwendenmann &amp; Veldkamp, 2006; Sotta et \n\nal., 2007). CO2 production estimates from Fick\u2019s law highlighted that CO2 production \n\noccurs mainly in the upper soil layers but small production rates occur down to a depth \n\nof 15 m. A low availability of microbial available C, very small nutrient concentrations \n\nin soil solutions and very low fine root densities in deep soil layers in our experiment \n\n(Germon et al., 2019; Laclau et al., 2010; Pradier, 2016) contributed to limiting the \n\n\n\n183 \n \n\n \n\nmicrobial activity (Fierer et al., 2003). The strong positive correlation between CO2 \n\nproduction and fine root biomass along the soil profiles suggest that Eucalyptus roots \n\nare probably the main source of CO2 in deep soil layers, both through root respiration \n\nand organic inputs decomposed by microbes. The same pattern was shown down to a \n\ndepth of 7 m in a moist tropical forest (Davidson et al., 2004). The seasonality of CO2 \n\nproduction was stronger in the topsoil than in deep soil layers. CO2 production was \n\nclose to 0 above a threshold of water filled pore space of 45% and small negative \n\nvalues of CO2 production were estimated in some deep soil layers. Negative values for \n\nCO2 production in deep soil layers have been reported in other studies (Davidson et \n\nal., 2004; De Jong &amp; Schappert, 1972; Risk et al., 2002). We speculate that high \n\ntranspiration rates of E. grandis trees in our experiment (Christina et al., 2018) might \n\nlead to a withdrawal of dissolved CO2 from deep soil layers to leaves through sap flow \n\n(Aubrey &amp; Teskey, 2009; Bloemen et al., 2013; Ford et al., 2007; Hanson &amp; Gunderson, \n\n2009). Further studies are needed to quantify the flux of dissolved CO2 via the xylem \n\nas Eucalyptus transform almost all incoming energy into latent heat flux through \n\ntranspiration (Vezy et al., 2018).  \n\nCH4 concentrations increase with soil depth in our study but they usually remain below \n\nthe concentration in ambient air. CH4 concentrations higher than in ambient air were \n\nmeasured at a few sampling dates in deep soil layers. As in our study, Davidson et al. \n\n(2004) found some soil areas with high CH4 productions down to a depth of 11 m in a \n\nmoist tropical forest. Spikes of CH4 concentration within the soil profile suggested that \n\nCH4 production occurred at various depths (down to 8 m) in a forest of the eastern \n\nAmazonia (Verchot et al., 2000). We show a CH4 consumption in the topsoil and a \n\nweak CH4 production in deep soil layers whatever the water supply regime in our \n\nexperiment. CH4 production primarily depends on the balance between two \n\nsimultaneously occurring processes, production by methanogens and consumption by \n\nmethanotrophic microorganisms (Dutaur &amp; Verchot, 2007; Tate, 2015). Diffusion of \n\ngases are inversely proportional to the water-filled pore space. When the water-filled \n\npore space decreases, the oxygen diffuses better and small changes in oxygen \n\navailability impact the balance between the two processes (Sanz-Cobena et al., 2014; \n\nWang et al., 2018). Indeed, drier soil condition enhance CH4 consumption whereas \n\nCH4 production is favored by microsites deprived of O2 in wet soil (Davidson, 1995).  \n\n\n\n184 \n \n\n \n \n\nSurprisingly, soil N2O concentrations were little influenced by the depth in our eucalypt \n\nstands. By contrast, Verchot et al. (1999) showed a sharp gradient of N2O \n\nconcentrations down to a depth of 8 m in a tropical forest of the eastern Amazonia, \n\nwhich suggested a low production in deep soil layers. N2O production in soils is driven \n\nby microbial nitrification (i.e. oxidation of NH4+ to NO3-) and denitrification (i.e. reduction \n\nof NO3- to N2O) (Bai et al., 2014; Ortiz-Gonzalo et al., 2018; Zhong et al., 2014). Soil \n\nmicrobes consuming N2O have been identified recently (Jones et al., 2013; Jones et \n\nal., 2014; Orellana et al., 2014; Sanford et al., 2012), and the low changes in N2O \n\nconcentrations with depth in our study might result from a simultaneous production and \n\nconsumption throughout the soil profile. The diffusivity model estimated slightly \n\nnegative N2O productions in some soil areas, which might a result of a reduction from \n\ndissolved N2O to N2 and/or a withdrawal from deep soil layers to leaves through sap \n\nflow (Chapuis?Lardy et al., 2007).  \n\n3.4.2 Effect of throughfall exclusion on soil CO2, CH4 and N2O productions \n\nContrary to our first hypothesis, throughfall exclusion did not significantly influence \n\nCO2, N2O and CH4 effluxes at the soil surface as well as the production throughout the \n\nsoil profile estimated with the diffusivity model. In both treatments +W and -W, soil CO2 \n\neffluxes were within the range of measurements in tropical forest ecosystems (Catt\u00e2nio \n\net al., 2002; Davidson et al., 2004; Davidson et al., 2008; Nouvellon et al., 2012; Sotta \n\net al., 2007). Higher CO2 effluxes in wet season than in dry season suggest that soil \n\nmoisture could be a strong driver of soil CO2 emissions, as pointed out in other tropical \n\nand subtropical forests (Courtois et al., 2018; Davidson et al., 2010; Davidson et al., \n\n2004; Sotta et al., 2007). Davidson et al. (2008) also found strong seasonal variations \n\nand no significant differences between control and throughfall exclusion treatments on \n\nCO2 effluxes in an Amazonian forest. Unlike our observations, Sotta et al. (2007) \n\nshowed in an Amazonian forest that CO2 effluxes were lower in a throughfall exclusion \n\nplot than in the control plot during the dry season, and no differences were found \n\nbetween the control plot and the throughfall exclusion plot during the wet season. Fine \n\nroot area index in treatment -W (32.8 m2 m-2) was significantly higher than in treatment \n\n+W (26.5 m2 m-2) in our 1.5-year-old coppice-managed Eucalyptus plantation (Germon \n\net al., 2019), which may have offset the depressive effect of throughfall exclusion on \n\nmicrobial activity via a decrease in soil moisture.  \n\n\n\n185 \n \n\n \n\nIn both treatments +W and -W, CH4 effluxes at soil surface were strongly negative over \n\nthe entire study period, which shows a net consumption of atmospheric CH4 by the \n\nsoil. CH4 consumption is common in nearly all types of aerated soils: in forests \n\n(Davidson et al., 2004; Davidson et al., 2008; Nakano et al., 2004), deserts (Hou et al., \n\n2012; McLain &amp; Martens, 2006; Oerter et al., 2018), grasslands (Fang et al., 2014; \n\nMosier et al., 1991) and tundra (Whalen &amp; Reeburgh, 1990). A wide diversity of \n\nmethanotrophs in tropical soils might account for steady CH4 effluxes at the soil \n\nsurface in treatments +W and -W despite strong seasonal changes in soil water \n\ncontents (Knief et al., 2005). N2O effluxes at the soil surface were also similar in \n\ntreatments +W and -W, with low seasonal variations. N2O effluxes were generally lower \n\nin dry season than in wet season in an Amazonian forest, and throughfall exclusion \n\ndecreased the seasonal variability (Davidson et al., 2004). N2O production is favored \n\nin wet soils while dry conditions favor the production of NO (Davidson et al., 2000a; \n\nFirestone &amp; Davidson, 1989). Interruption of tree transpiration after cutting the trees in \n\nour experiment led to high soil water contents in the topsoil over most of the study \n\nperiod, which might explain the low influence of treatments +W and -W on greenhouse \n\ngas effluxes.  \n\nWhile CO2, N2O and CH4 effluxes at the soil surface were not influenced by throughfall \n\nexclusion in our study, the concentrations of CO2 and N2O were 18.1 and 6.9% lower, \n\nrespectively, and  CH4 concentrations were 60% higher in treatment -W than in \n\ntreatment +W. Modeling effective diffusivity showed that the cumulated production \n\nrates of CO2, N2O and CH4 in each soil layer were similar in the two treatments. The \n\neffects of throughfall exclusion on gas concentrations throughout the soil profiles were \n\nmainly a result of the influence of soil water contents on soil gas diffusivity. High soil \n\nwater contents in the +W treatment lead to a saturation of the pore-space with water, \n\nwhich results in a slow diffusion of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere also pointed \n\nout in other studies (Maier et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018). Throughfall exclusion \n\nexperiments in tropical and subtropical forests show site-dependent responses to a \n\ndecrease in throughfall for CO2, N2O and CH4 concentrations in very deep soil profiles \n\n(4 m deep or more). Throughfall exclusion can either decrease (Catt\u00e2nio et al., 2002) \n\nor increase (Davidson et al., 2004), N2O concentrations in deep soil profiles and can \n\nlead to either similar (Davidson et al., 2004) or lower (Sotta et al., 2007; Van Straaten \n\net al., 2011), CO2 concentrations than in control plots. CH4 concentrations in deep soil \n\n\n\n186 \n \n\n \n \n\nprofiles were either similar (Davidson et al., 2004) or higher (Catt\u00e2nio et al., 2002) in \n\nresponse to throughfall exclusion than in control plots.  \n\n3.4.3 Effect of harvesting trees on soil CO2, CH4 and N2O effluxes \n\nContrary to our third hypothesis, cutting all the trees did not lead to an increase in CO2, \n\nCH4 and N2O effluxes, whatever the water supply regime. Harvesting Eucalyptus trees \n\nin plantations managed in short rotations lead to huge changes in soil environment \n\nlikely to enhance organic matter decomposition, with an increase in soil temperature \n\nand soil moisture as well as accumulation of harvest residues at soil surface (Christina \n\net al., 2017; Mendham et al., 2002; O'connell et al., 2004; Rocha et al., 2016). Another \n\nstudy in our experiment showed that harvesting did not lead to an increase in root \n\nmortality in the stands managed in coppice, whatever the water supply regime \n\n(Germon et al., 2019). We speculate that the lack of effect of clearcutting on CO2 \n\neffluxes in our experiment may result from a decrease in root respiration after the \n\nharvest offsetting an increase in decomposition of organic matter at the soil surface.  \n\nReplanting present several drawbacks. Parfitt et al. (2001) showed that harvesting and \n\nreplanting Pinus radiata resulted in a reduction of N status in soil, a loss of organic \n\nmatter and an increase in soil respiration because roots from the previous rotation are \n\ndecomposed and surface-soil microbial activity is enhanced following the clear-cut. \n\nFurthermore, harvesting and replanting are usually accompanied by considerable soil \n\ndisturbance and also are longer exposed to wind and to erosion (Berhongaray et al., \n\n2017). Coppice management might be an interesting option in Eucalyptus plantations \n\nmanaged in short rotation, to help mitigate the increase in CO2, CH4 and N2O in the \n\natmosphere and to limit soil erosion compared to systematic replanting.  \n\nVery deep tropical soils cover large areas worldwide and improving our understanding \n\nof soil- plant interactions throughout deep soil profiles is needed to improve the \n\nbiogeochemical models used to predict the consequences of climate change on \n\ngreenhouse gas effluxes in tropical planted forests. The dynamics of greenhouse gas \n\nconcentrations in soil profiles result from the activity of microbial communities and can \n\nhelp gaining insight into the factors controlling biological activity in deep soil layers. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n187 \n \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThe study was funded by S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP, Project \n\n2015/24911-8 and Project 2017/13572-3), Centre de cooperation Internationale en \n\nRecherche Agronomique pour le D\u00e9veloppement (CIRAD) and S\u00e3o Paulo University. \n\nThis study belongs to SOERE F-ORE-T, which is supported annually by Ecofor, Allenvi \n\nand the French National Research Infrastructure ANAEE-F (http://www.anaee-\n\nfrance.fr/fr/).

The \n\ncentral objective of this additional work is to present the advances on a modeling \n\napproach carried out in this thesis in order to gain insight into the processes governing \n\nCO2 transfer at a local scale. We aimed to couple a Numerical Model for the Analysis \n\nof the Geochemical Evolution of Mineral-Water-Air Systems (Min3P) with a simple root \n\narchitecture model, Root-Typ. \n\nTo consider the distribution of eucalypt fine roots within the entire root profile, including \n\nthe deep soil horizons, we first tried to calibrate the Root-Typ model (Part 1) with \n\neucalypt root data measured at Itatinga, then we tried to include fine root dynamics in \n\nMin3P (Part 2). \n\nThis additional will not be published in a scientific journal because the development \n\ninitiated in this thesis could not lead to exploitable results. \n\nHowever, the following co-authors are associated with and involved in the work: Loic \n\nPag\u00e8s, Christophe Jourdan, Jean-Paul Laclau and C\u00e9line Blitz-Frayret for the \n\ncalibration and parametrization of the Root-Typ Model, and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gerard, Guerric \n\nLe Maire, Jean-Paul Laclau and particularly C\u00e9line Blitz-Frayret for the calibration and \n\nparametrization of the Min3P model. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n200 \n \n\n \n \n\n4.1  Introduction \n\nAfter a strong expansion in the last 20 years, forest plantations account for 7% of the \n\ntotal forest area in the world (Keenan et al., 2015). In tropical and subtropical regions, \n\nplantations of fast-growing tree species store large amounts of carbon and contribute \n\nto reducing the exploitation of natural forests by providing an increasing proportion of \n\nthe global demand of wood (Keenan et al., 2015). Fast-growing Eucalyptus plantations \n\ncover about 20 million hectares throughout the world (Booth, 2013) with about 5.6 \n\nmillion hectares in Brazil (IBA, 2016). In Brazil, most of Eucalyptus plantations are \n\nsettled in areas with very deep soils (> 5m) with low fertility and prolonged drought \n\nperiods (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2013). \n\nFuture climate projections predict longer and stronger dry periods for eastern-south \n\nAmerica (Solomon et al., 2009). In this context, coppice management of eucalypt \n\nplantations could be an interesting option to face water deficit because, after the \n\nharvest, the trees are likely to benefit from an already installed root system making it \n\npossible to access to deep soil layers where water availability is higher than in the \n\ntopsoil. Our aim was to gain insight into the consequences of drought on fine root \n\nproduction and mortality as well as on the production of greenhouse gases down to \n\nthe water table (at a depth of 17 m). These effects have been monitored before and \n\nafter harvesting in a coppice-managed Eucalyptus grandis stand under two contrasting \n\nwater supply regimes: the undisturbed rainfall as a control and 37% throughfall \n\nreduction to assess the effects of water deficit on tree and soil functioning.  \n\nThe consequences of tree harvesting on root dynamics the first year of the rotation in \n\ncoppice-managed plantations ask specific questions never studied, particularly in deep \n\nsoil layers. After the harvest, fine root mortality leads to an input of organic matter at \n\ndifferent depths (Berhongaray et al., 2015). Decomposition of fresh organic matter may \n\nenhance the degradation of pre-existing organic matter, stabilized or not (Fontaine et \n\nal., 2007; Derrien et al., 2014) through a \"priming effect\" (Kuzyakov et al., 2000). The \n\n\"priming effect\" could affect carbon storage by the ecosystem and indirectly influence \n\nthe nitrogen cycle. Most of the studies dealing with soil carbon storage are limited to \n\nthe upper meter of the soil profile (Harper and Tibbett, 2013). The dynamics of CO2 \n\nconcentrations across soil profiles down to a depth of more than 10 m have never been \n\nstudied in tropical forest plantations. \n\n\n\n201 \n \n\n \n\nWe have studied fine root dynamics (production and mortality) using the minirhizotrons \n\ntechnique and measured the concentrations of CO2 down to the water table in the \n\nchapters 2 and 3. Root dynamics and gas concentrations were monitored before and \n\nafter the harvest of Eucalyptus grandis trees in a throughfall exclusion experiment, \n\ncomparing plots with 37% of throughfall excluded by plastic sheets (-W), and plots \n\nwithout rain exclusion (+W). The main results obtained over 3 months before clear-\n\ncutting, then over 18 months in coppice, showed that CO2 concentrations increased on \n\naverage from 4475 \u00b1 2180 ppm at a soil depth of 10 cm to 15885 \u00b1 3538 ppm at a \n\ndepth of 15.5 m across the two water supply regimes. CO2 concentrations measured \n\nin treatment -W were on average 20.7% lower than in treatment +W, across the \n\nsampling depths.  \n\nWe intended to go beyond the current measurements of gas concentrations at different \n\ndepths in the soil profile through a mechanistic modeling approach making it possible \n\nto assess the production of gas throughout the soil profiles and to infer the sensibility \n\nof gas production to environmental factors. To better understand the dynamics of \n\norganic matter in deep tropical soils and to improve the modeling of element flows, it \n\nis necessary to quantify in situ the carbon (CO2 as well as dissolved inorganic and \n\norganic C) concentrations throughout entire soil profiles (down to the root front), and \n\nto characterize the carbon stabilization/destabilization processes, as well as the main \n\nregulatory factors. A modeling approach was required to (i) quantify the production of \n\nCO2 in different soil horizons from soil properties, root growth and gas concentration \n\nmeasurements throughout the profile, and (ii) to improve our understanding of transfer \n\nprocesses and the contribution of CO2 deep production mechanisms to soil surface \n\nemissions (Maier and Schack-Kirchner, 2014).   \n\nReactive transport models derived from Darcy\u2019s law allows a dynamic description of \n\ntransient water flow in soils but also chemical processes controlling soil solution \n\nchemical composition (Feyen et al., 1998; Simunek et al., 2006; Samou\u00eblian et al., \n\n2007; Steefel et al., 2015). Reactive transport models require a vast number of input \n\nparameters and careful calibration procedures. Steefel et al. (2015) compared the key \n\nflow and transport features of the most commonly used reactive transport models: \n\nPHT3D, OpenGeoSys (OGS), ORCHESTRA, TOUGHREACT, eSTOMP, \n\nHYDROGEOCHEM, Crunch-Flow and MIN3P (Table 1). \n\n\n\n202 \n \n\n \n \n\nTable 1 - Comparison of the key flow and transport features of reactive transport models (adapted from Steefel et al.

This model was used in order to try to \n\ncarry out simulations of the biogeochemical processes coupled with the transport of \n\nwater, solutes and gases in soil (Mayer et al., 2012). Indeed, gas transport is highly \n\ndependent on soil moisture and modeling soil water fluxes is therefore compulsory. \n\nThe fate of organic matter in very deep soil horizons remains poorly documented, \n\nwhich is a serious concern of the current modeling approaches of soil carbon dynamics \n\n(Fontaine et al., 2007; Rumpel and K\u00f6gel-Knabner, 2011; Mathieu et al., 2015). \n\nA modeling approach was needed to answer to the following questions: \n\n- What are the main transport and reaction processes accounting for the \n\nobserved CO2 concentrations in a deep tropical soil explored by roots in \n\neucalypt plantations? \n\n- What is the contribution of fine roots in CO2 effluxes at the soil surface? \n\n- What are the consequences of drought periods on CO2 production and efflux in \n\neucalypt plantations established in deep Ferralsols? \n\n- What are the consequences of future climatic scenarios on CO2 production in \n\ndeep soil layers and the effluxes at the soil surface? \n\nProcess-based models are needed to gain insight into the biogeochemical processes \n\ndriving the concentrations of greenhouse gases measured at a few dates in soil \n\nprofiles. \n\nModeling root architecture development is important to simulate temporal and spatial \n\ndynamics of the root system architecture. Root architectural models are also useful to \n\nestimate global root variables like biomass or surface over depth and time. They are \n\nparameterized by root type (e.g. RootTyp, Pag\u00e8s et al. (2004); ArchiSimple, Pag\u00e8s et \n\nal. (2014); DigR, Barczi et al. (2018)) or by branching order (e.g. OpenSimRoot; \n\nPostma et al. (2017);  parametric L-system modeling; Leitner et al. (2010)). The \n\nnumber of parameters needed to simulate root architecture vary among models and \n\ninfer their level of complexity (Dunbabin et al., 2013). Root number, root diameter, root \n\nvolume, and root radial distances are the main parameters of root system \n\nbiomechanics (Nicoll and Ray, 1996; Danquechin Dorval et al., 2016). RootTyp model \n\n\n\n204 \n \n\n \n \n\nshowed promising efficiency in modeling root system development of Quercu petraea \n\n(Collet et al., 2006) but also several species with various structures (Bingham and Wu, \n\n2011; Chen et al., 2011; Couvreur et al., 2012). RootTyp model is easy to calibrate \n\nwhile combining many processes of root system development: (1) emission of new \n\nroots from the shoot system, (2) elongation, (3) branching, (4) radial growth and (5) \n\ndecay and self-pruning of existing roots. This architectural model can also be coupled \n\nwith models simulating nutrient uptake (Mayer, 1999; Bonneu et al., 2012; Mayer et \n\nal., 2012), water transport (Doussan et al., 1998) or rhizospheric processes (Kim and \n\nSilk, 1999) or even reactive transport model (Mayer, 1999; Mayer et al., 2012). \n\nWe aimed to couple a Numerical Model for the Analysis of the Geochemical Evolution \n\nof Mineral-Water-Air Systems (Min3P) with a simple root architecture model, Root-Typ \n\n(Pag\u00e8s et al., 2004), to gain insight into the processes governing CO2 transfer at a \n\nlocal scale. To consider the distribution of eucalypt fine roots within the entire root \n\nprofile, including the deep soil horizons, we first tried to calibrate the Root-Typ model \n\n(Part 1) with eucalypt root data measured at Itatinga, then we tried to include fine root \n\ndynamics in Min3P (Part 2). \n\n4.2 Part 1: The Root Typ model \n\n4.2.1 Calibration and parameterization of the Root Typ model \n\nDescription and parameterization of the Root Typ model \n\nThe Root Typ model (Pag\u00e8s et al., 2004) simulates root growth processes at a daily \n\ntime step: emission of new roots, elongation, branching and radial growth of various \n\nplant species by computing at each time step the root segments and the corresponding \n\nroot length densities on a Cartesian grid. The model implements several \n\ndevelopmental processes including root emission, axial and radial growth, sequential \n\nbranching, reiteration, transition, decay and abscission. To simulate tree root systems, \n\nadditional parameters are needed to simulate reiteration, senescence and late \n\nemission processes. All the parameters of Root Typ model are indexed to the apical \n\ndiameter of all roots without distinction of root typology, which is impossible to assume \n\nin order to simulate growth and distribution of all types of roots of Eucalyptus trees \n\nwithin the soil profile. The issue was thus to adapt the Root Typ model to Eucalyptus \n\ntrees. \n\n\n\n205 \n \n\n \n\nDefinition of root types \n\nThe Root Typ parametrization started with the definition of root types. In order to \n\nrepresent the most accurately Eucalyptus root systems we defined 6 root types. They \n\nare described and listed below (Figure 1 ). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - Schematic representation of Eucalyptus root system in vertical view, with \nthe different root types and their characteristics. \n\n \n\nThe root segments are not indexed to the position, so we had to create each time \n\nintermediate types for the macrostructure to distinguish between proximal and distal \n\nsystems. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Type 1: Juvenile tap root, orthotropic root from the radicle.  \n\n\u2022 Type 2: Mature tap root, orthotropic root that follow the juvenile tap root by \n\ntransformation, can be carried by plagiotropic roots.  \n\n\u2022 Type 3:  Juvenile plagiotropic macrorhize, plagiotropic root from the juvenile tap \n\nroot. \n\n\u2022 Type 4:  Mature plagiotropic macrorhize, plagiotropic root that follow the juvenile \n\nplagiotropic roots by transformation. \n\n\u2022 Type 5: Intermediate roots between macrorhizes and brachyrhizes \n\n\n\n206 \n \n\n \n \n\n\u2022 Type 6: brachyrhizes. Extremely fine roots.  \n\n \n\nParameters needed for modeling \n\nFor each root type, several root parameters are needed for this dynamic developmental \n\nmodel. There are listed below: \n\n\u2022 Average and standard deviation of the insertion angle \n\n\u2022 Duration before emergence  \n\n\u2022 Growth parameters: maximum, average and standard deviation of growth rate  \n\n\u2022 Inter-branch distance along the root  \n\n\u2022 Indicator of tropism type and tropism intensity \n\n\u2022 Sensibility to mechanical constraint \n\n\u2022 Apical diameter  \n\n\u2022 Necrosis duration  \n\n\u2022 Dates of reiterations and probability for reiteration at the reiteration dates \n\n\u2022 Minimal and maximal number of reiterated roots \n\n\u2022 Age from which transition may happen and daily probability of transition \n\n\u2022 Proportions of type among the branches  \n\n \n\nA literature review made it possible to estimate all the parameters needed for the \n\nsimulations. We mainly used data obtained in Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil and \n\nCongo. Most of the data dealing with root architecture came from the PhD thesis \u201cStudy \n\nof the root system of Eucalyptus in tropical plantation: architectural analysis, growth \n\nand respiration\u201d of Armel Thongo M\u2019Bou in Congo (Thongo M\u2019Bou, 2008). \n\nThe next step was to include for each root type a coefficient for diameter increases \n\nthroughout tree growth. Then we included into the code the possibility of choosing the \n\nseed to start the simulation. Those changes were important to represent accurately \n\nEucalyptus root systems and to validate the output simulations made.     \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n207 \n \n\n \n\nSetting up a R routine for calculation of root length per volume of soil \n\nIn order to represent an accurate root system, we had to estimate the root length \n\nsimulated per volume of soil. A R routine was coded using the output of the Root Typ \n\nmodel to compare the results simulated with the data obtained in the field.  \n\n \n\nModification of root density and ramification varying within the soil profile \n\nWe modified the soil profile component of the Root Typ model to include changes in \n\nroot density and ramification within the soil profile. We also increased the soil profile \n\ndepth down to 17 m.  \n\n \n\n4.2.2  Main results obtained by simulations using the Root Typ model \n\nWe succeeded in simulating realistic root systems throughout the development of \n\nEucalyptus trees (Figure 2 , Figure 3 , Figure 5 ). \n\n \n\nFigure 2 - Simulated Eucalyptus root system using the Root Typ model at age 6 \nmonths, in a XZ orientation and representation within the soil profile (left) and traced \nviewing from above the soil surface (XY) orientation (right). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n208 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n209 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3 - Simulated Eucalyptus root system using the Root Typ model at age 1 year \n(a), 2 years (b) and 3 years (c), in a XZ orientation representation within the soil profile \n(left) and traced viewing from above the soil surface (XY). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 - Fine root length (m m-2) per soil layer simulated using the Root Typ model \n(blue) and measured (collected in the field) for Eucalyptus plantations of age 3 years \n\nTotal root length obtained with the simulations using Root Typ Model were consistent \n\nwith the measured data (observed in the field) for Eucalyptus plantations of 3 years of \n\nage, but the distribution throughout the different soil layers were not accurately \n\nsimulated (Figure 4 ).  \n\n \n\n\n\n210 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5 - Simulated Eucalyptus root system using the Root Typ model at age 6 years, \nin a XZ orientation and representation within the soil profile (left) and traced viewing \nfrom above the soil surface (XY) (right). \n\n \n\n4.2.3 Discussion and perspectives \n\nDespite several attempts of simulations and 6 different modified versions of the Root \n\nTyp model, we did not succeed in designing simulated fine root densities close to the \n\nvalues measured in the field, especially between layers within the soil profile.  \n\nParticularly, we did not manage to simulate the measured dynamics (too sharp \n\nmortality, high variability between the simulations). Therefore, we decided to force \n\nmeasured values as input values for root length density into the Min3P model in order \n\nto achieve the objectives of the project. \n\nHowever, the improvement we made for the Root Typ model were important and more \n\ntime is needed to parametrize and calibrate this model to tree root system development \n\nthroughout an entire rotation. This work showed that the Root Typ model can be used \n\nto simulate tree root development over short period (up to 1-2 years) but more research \n\nis needed to simulate an entire rotation, as planned in our study. The two main issues \n\nrose in our project are listed and discussed here after. \n\n  \n\n\n\n211 \n \n\n \n\nToo much variability between seeds (simulations) \n\nThis is indeed a problem with stochastic models, when an event arriving early is very \n\nstructuring for the future. In reality, compensating regulations operate, which are \n\ndifficult to account for in this type of model. We should avoid in the setting up of the \n\nmodel, the very unlikely events that have a strong impact. For example, there must be \n\na sufficient number of plagiotropic roots, varying their asymptotic lengths.  \n\nExclusive pruning \n\nAll root branches have shorter root longevity than the bearing roots, therefore when \n\nbranches are pruned the bearing axes become bare, which is never the case in the \n\nfield. Therefore, a gap in the root length density was observed according to soil depth \n\nin the output simulations that we did not observe in field measurements within the entire \n\nsoil profile.  \n\nIndeed, the fact of having a fixed lifespan for all roots belonging to the same diameter \n\nclass generates unrealistic simulations. Several options could be tested in further \n\nstudies, not necessarily exclusive: \n\n\u2022 To create a root type that does not grow too fast with a wide range of length. \n\nSome will be pruned quickly and other should stay longer throughout the soil \n\nprofile simulated \n\n\u2022 To include into the code the possibility to have little branches (small branching \n\ndensities) in such way that the longer roots carry some branches and therefore \n\ndo not prune.   \n\n\u2022 To create a new root type of extremely fine roots that grow for longer period and \n\nbranch or live longer than extremely fine roots that are pruned quickly. \n\n\u2022 Include into the code a proximal reiteration regularly, to keep alive roots \n\neverywhere. \n\n\u2022 Include into the code for a root lifespan different within the soil profile and for \n\neach root type. \n\nModeling architecture development and dynamics of deep fine roots are hindered by \n\nthe limited data available in the literature yet indispensable to parametrize and evaluate \n\n\n\n212 \n \n\n \n \n\nthe models. Root number, root diameter, root volume, and root radial distances are the \n\nmain parameters of root system biomechanics (Nicoll and Ray, 1996; Danquechin \n\nDorval et al., 2016), varying considerably with soil layers. The plasticity of root system \n\narchitecture development responding to their environment is strongly influenced by soil \n\ndepth. Root architectural models through a simulation in 3D space of the root system \n\ncould simulate accurately spatial and temporal dynamics. But integrate into a model a \n\nvertically discretized soils is particularly important as shallow and deep roots present \n\ndifferent spatial and temporal dynamics. Model parametrization needs to consider \n\nshallow and deeper-rooted root system behaving differently to environmental factors \n\nand soil conditions. \n\n4.3 Part 2 : Min3P model \n\n4.3.1 Calibration and parameterization of the Min3P model \n\nDescription of Min3P model \n\nMin3P (Mayer et al., 2012) is a finite-volume reactive transport model including flow in \n\nthe aqueous phase using Richard\u2019s equations and transport in the aqueous and gas \n\nphase. The flow and transport are computed on a representative domain of the field, \n\ncomposed of a Cartesian grid with elementary volumes called \u2018control volumes\u2019. \n\nPrimary variables of the model are aqueous concentrations, which are considered in \n\nequilibrium with gas-phase concentrations according to Henry\u2019s law.  The use of the \n\nDusty Gas Model for gas-phase transport allows the implementation of the transport \n\nmechanisms often neglected in previous studies (Molins et al., 2008). The model \n\nformulation includes diffusion and advection to account for gas transport. Diffusion of \n\ngases is described by Stefan-Maxwell equations. To model diffusive fluxes with gases \n\ncharacterized by different molecular weights, a non-separative component may be \n\npresent. Gas fluxes included in the experiment can be large enough to generate \n\nsignificant pressure gradients, leading to advective fluxes computed by Darcy\u2019s law. \n\nField observations and laboratory studies have revealed that additional processes can \n\ncontrol biogeochemical evolution in the vadose zone, possibly attenuating gas \n\nemissions in the atmosphere. For this reason, reactions taking place in the aqueous \n\nphase such as oxidation of methane by bacteria producing carbon dioxide, water and \n\n\n\n213 \n \n\n \n\norganic carbon, are also implemented. Finally, diffusive and advective gas fluxes and \n\nreaction source-sink term contribute to the mass balance. \n\nMin3P is particularly suitable for the current study thanks to its implementation of the \n\nuptake of water and solute by plants (G\u00e9rard et al., 2004; G\u00e9rard et al., 2008). Indeed, \n\ngas transfer in the soil is highly dependent on soil water content and modeling soil \n\nwater fluxes is therefore compulsory (Figure 6 ). Separate sink terms have been \n\nimplemented in the Richard\u2019s equation to account for physical evaporation and \n\ntranspiration (components of the root water uptake) in Min3P. For each control volume \n\nof the grid, the physical evaporation is depending on the local water saturation and is \n\nconsidered as a one-dimensional process in vertical direction along a soil column. To \n\nmodel the biological plant transpiration process, the evaporative budget has to be \n\nestimated and is determined with the soil moisture, allowing the consideration of the \n\nnegative effects of water stress on plant transpiration. Finally, the solute uptake has \n\nbeen implemented by an additional sink term in the mass balance equation. Then, two \n\nuptake regimes are considered: 1) passive solute uptake where the solute uptake rate \n\nis equal to the water uptake rate and 2) rejective or active solute uptake. Rejective \n\nuptake implies the solute to be left behind water during uptake by the root (leading to \n\nan increase of solute quantity in the root zone) and active uptake implies a preferential \n\nsolute uptake by the plant root (leading to a solute depletion in the root zone).  \n\nThe first key step was to calibrate and parameterize the water transport. The \n\nsimulations of water dynamics were validated using measurements of: (i) actual \n\ntranspiration fluxes and (ii) volumetric soil water content monitored over the whole \n\nstudy period. The climatic variables (potential and actual transpiration fluxes, \n\nprecipitation) determined at the experimental site were used either to constrain the \n\nmodel or to validate it.  \n\n \n\n\n\n214 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 6 - Graphical representation of the close link between water transport and CO2 production, transport and effluxes. \n\n\n\n215 \n \n\n \n\nSoil parameterization and root profiles \n\nThree layers of 33.3 cm thickness were defined to account for the variability of soil and \n\nroot characteristics in the upper meter. Layers of 50 cm were defined from a depth of \n\n1m to a depth of 18 m. Soil retention curves and hydraulic conductivity were estimated \n\nat the same site using Van Genuchten equations. In each soil layer, the soil water \n\npotential was linked to the soil water content by the relation of Van Genuchten (1980). \n\n?? = ??? +  \n1 ? ???\n\n(1 + |???|?)?\n \n\n? = 1 ?\n1\n\n?\n                  ?? =\n\n??\n\n???\n                   ??? =\n\n???\n\n???\n \n\n \n\nWith: \n\nSa  saturation of the aqueous phase \n\nSra  residual saturation of the aqueous phase \n\n?a  volumetric water contents \n\n?sa  volumetric water content at saturation \n\n?ra  residual water content \n\n?a  pressure head \n\n \n\nResidual soil water content in each soil layer was calibrated using MAESPA model \n\n(Christina et al., 2017) used at the same site. The MAESPA model, fully described in \n\nDuursma and Medlyn (2012), is a soil-plant-atmosphere model simulating forest \n\ncanopy radiation absorption, photosynthesis and water balance. Soil hydraulic \n\nconductivity at saturation was measured at the same site down to a depth of 3 m \n\n(Maquere, 2008) and assumed to decrease linearly from 3 to 7 m depth and to be \n\nconstant for the soil layers below 7 m down to 18m. Soil porosity was also measured \n\ndown to 3 m and assumed constant below 3m. Evapotranspiration and soil evaporation \n\nwere obtained by simulations using MAESPA model each day over the entire rotation \n\n(6 years).   \n\nA literature review and simulations of the MAESPA model were realized to obtain the \n\ninitial condition variability-saturated flow. The initial condition of hydraulic charge, \n\npressure head, saturation, soil water content and root evaporation are necessary for \n\nflow simulations. Other inputs needed for the simulation are the daily climatic data.  \n\n\n\n216 \n \n\n \n \n\nWe were not able to use the outputs of the Root Typ model, so we estimated a relation \n\nbetween root length density, depth and time using root distributions along the soil \n\nprofile measured at 1, 2, 3 and 7 years after planting. Root distributions were measured \n\nby soil coring (see Germon et al. (2018) and Christina et al. (2011) and Chapter 2 for \n\nthe method). \n\n \n\n?????? = exp (?12.48 + 1.725 ? ?????? + 0.0017 ? ???? + 0.003961 ?  ?????? ? ????) \n\n \n\nWith:  \n\nRLDSim, Simulated root length density  \n\nDepth, Soil depth in cm   \n\nTime, time in days \n\nThis equation was added into the Min3P code and we also modified the code to print \n\nsoil water content outputs every day along the simulation time.  \n\n4.3.2  Discussion and perspectives from simulations using Min3P model  \n\nThe simulations results in Figure 7  show that the soil water contents can be modeled \n\nover an entire rotation, but improvements are still needed. Unfortunately, we did not \n\nhave enough time to conclude the parameterization and calibration of the Min3P model. \n\n\n\n217 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7 - Soil water contents (Theta_a %) within the soil profile down to a depth of 18 m simulated with the Min3P model (Cmvs 2, \ntop) and simulated with the MAESPA model (Maespa, bottom) every day from June 1st, 2010 to May 31, 2016, which was the entire \nrotation for this Eucalyptus grandis plantation in the undisturbed rainfall plot. Soil water content graphical representation is a contour \nline interpolation using marching square algorithm. R software version 3.4.4 and the package plotly version 4.8.0 were used.\n\n\n\n218 \n \n\n \n \n\nModel parameterization should be better described, particularly regarding the accuracy \n\nat which the root system and potential transpiration are simulated over time. Further \n\nstudies dealing with long-term effects of rainfall regimes on soil water resources, could \n\ncontribute to evaluating adaptive changes induced by drought periods in tropical \n\nEucalyptus plantations. \n\nplantations. \n\nCO2 production during fine root decomposition and root respiration \n\nSimulations should include CO2 gas emissions produced at each time step by fine roots \n\n(mortality and decomposition, root respiration, \u2026). From these results, a comparison \n\nwith the measurements of CO2 performed throughout the soil profile need to be \n\nperformed to assess the main gas transport processes and sources.  \n\nCO2 production has been found to be correlated to root biomass throughout the soil \n\nprofile (Chapter 3). Mechanistic biogeochemical models need to include the \n\nrelationships between soil CO2 production and soil water potential, soil temperature \n\nover time, but also fine root growth and root activity across soil layers. Indeed, \n\nincorporating the different level of processes of root respiration and microbial \n\ndecomposition over depths should provide more accurate estimations and could \n\nreduce uncertainty in model simulations.   \n\nPrediction of CO2 production in deep soil profiles under climate change \n\nSimulations to explore the effects of future climate scenarios on CO2 production and \n\ntransfer in deep tropical soils could be performed including the current measurements \n\nas initial boundary conditions, and by comparing climatic series representing future \n\nclimatic scenarios at the experimental field location. The predictions could be useful to \n\nassess qualitatively the consequences of climate change on CO2 production in tropical \n\neucalypt plantations growing on deep Ferralsols. \n\nConclusion \n\nThe modeling approach used in this thesis revealed promising efficiency in a model \n\nthat couple root system architecture and functions, the Root Typ model, with reactive \n\ntransport processes in soils, the Min3P model. Unfortunately, this thesis also revealed \n\nseveral issues that we could not overcome over the available time of 6 months at the \n\n\n\n219 \n \n\n \n\nend of the thesis. This chapter showed that additional experimental researches and \n\nmodel developments are required to assess the production of gas throughout the soil \n\nprofiles and to infer the sensibility of gas production to environmental factors in this \n\nEucalyptus plantation. Therefore, a specific thesis in modeling is required to reinforce \n\nand further explore the possibilities of coupling Min3P and RootTyp to gain insight into \n\nthe processes governing greenhouse gases transfer at a local scale.  \n\nReferences  \n\nBarczi, J.-F., Rey, H., Griffon, S., Jourdan, C., 2018.

But the consequences of mixing trees \n\non root growth and fine-root morphology in very deep soil layers is poorly know.  \n\nIn this study, root sampling was realized down to 17 m in A. mangium and E. grandis \n\nmonospecific stands and a mixture with 50% of each species using the method \n\ndescribed in chapter 2. In this study, I did not contribute to the acquisition of the data, \n\nbut I contributed to the data analysis as well as the statistical analyses and the writing \n\nof the paper. \n\nThis article is intitled \u201cConsequences of mixing Acacia mangium and Eucalyptus \n\ngrandis trees on soil exploration by fine-roots down to a depth of 17 m\u201d.

While fine-root over-yielding has been \n\nshown in the upper soil layers of mixed-species forests relative to monospecific stands, \n\nthe consequences of tree diversity on fine-root growth in very deep soil layers is still \n\nunknown. Our study aimed to assess the consequences of mixing Acacia mangium \n\nand Eucalyptus grandis trees on soil exploration by roots down to the water table at 17 \n\nm depth in a tropical planted forest.  \n\nMethod Fine roots (diameter &lt;2 mm) were sampled in a randomized block design with \n\nthree treatments: monospecific stands of Acacia mangium (100A), Eucalyptus grandis \n\n(100E), and mixed stands with 50% of each species (50A50E). Root ingrowth bags \n\nwere installed at 4 depths (from 0.1 m to 6 m) in the three treatments within three \n\ndifferent blocks, to study the fine-root production over 2 periods of 3 months.  \n\nResults Down to 17 m depth, total fine-root biomass was 1127 g m-2 in 50A50E, 780 g \n\nm-2 in 100A and 714 g m-2 in 100E. Specific root length and specific root area were \n\n110-150% higher in 50A50E than in 100A for Acacia mangium trees and 34% higher \n\nin 50A50E than in 100E for Eucalyptus grandis trees. Ingrowth bags showed that the \n\ncapacity of fine roots to explore soil patches did not decrease down to a depth of 6 m \n\nfor the two species.  \n\nConclusions Belowground interactions between Acacia mangium and Eucalyptus \n\ngrandis trees greatly increased the exploration of very deep soil layers by fine roots, \n\nwhich is likely to enhance the uptake of soil resources. Mixing tree species might \n\ntherefore increase the resilience of tropical planted forests through a better exploration \n\nof deep soils.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n226 \n \n\n \n \n\n5.1 Introduction \n\nPlantations of fast-growing trees are expanding rapidly to meet the increasing demand \n\nfor wood products (Keenan et al., 2015). The area covered by planted forests \n\nincreased from about 168 million ha in 1990 to 278 million ha in 2015, and a large \n\nshare of the new forest plantations are at sites with in highly weathered tropical soils \n\n(Keenan et al., 2015). Fast-growing Eucalyptus plantations cover about 20 million \n\nhectares throughout the world (Booth, 2013) with about 5.6 million hectares in Brazil \n\n(IBA 2016). Eucalyptus plantations provide raw material for pulp and paper, charcoal \n\nand firewood in Brazil (Battie-Laclau et al., 2014; Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2013). While most \n\nof these eucalypt plantations are monospecific, mixed-species stands including \n\nnitrogen (N) fixing trees can help to balance the N budget, improve the N status of the \n\neucalypts (Forrester et al., 2006; Paula et al., 2015) and, in some situations, increase \n\nthe total biomass production (Forrester, 2014; Richards et al., 2010). Multi-purpose \n\nplantations can provide key ecosystem services (Paquette &amp; Messier, 2010), and \n\npositive relationships between tree diversity and soil fauna, microbial diversity, and soil \n\ncarbon (C) sequestration are well documented (Blaser et al., 2014; Forrester, 2014; \n\nRichards et al., 2010). Acacia mangium Wild is another fast-growing tree species \n\nwidely planted in South-East Asia for pulpwood. Introduction of Acacia mangium trees \n\ninto commercial eucalypt plantations has been tested recently in Brazil and Congo \n\n(Bouillet et al., 2013; Santos et al., 2016; Voigtlaender et al., 2012). Those studies \n\nshowed that mixed A. mangium and Eucalyptus stands had higher available mineral N \n\nin the soil than monospecific eucalypt stands (Tchichelle et al., 2017; Voigtlaender et \n\nal., 2012) and that, in some situations, the total biomass production was higher in \n\nmixed stands than monospecific eucalypt stands at the same stocking density (Bouillet \n\net al., 2013; Epron et al., 2013; Santos et al., 2016). While the benefits consequences \n\nof a stratified canopy in mixed-species plantations are well documented (Bauhus et al., \n\n2004; Binkley et al., 2013; Le Maire et al., 2013; Williams et al., 2017), soil partitioning \n\nbetween the roots of different tree species in a mixed stand has not been studied to \n\nthe same extent. \n\nRoots play a key role in forest ecosystems with their mechanical functions of tree \n\nanchorage and their physiological function of capturing and transporting the amounts \n\nof water and nutrients needed for plant growth (McCormack &amp; Guo, 2014; Pregitzer et \n\nal., 2002). Niche complementary among the fine roots of different species is often cited \n\n\n\n227 \n \n\n \n\nas one of the major processes that can contribute to increasing biomass production in \n\nmulti-species stands compared to single-species forests (Lehmann  &amp; Schroth, 2003). \n\nStudies dealing with fine-root density in mixed-species forests are scarce and mainly \n\nlimited to the upper soil layers. Deep roots, commonly defined as roots growing below \n\n1 m, can provide access to water and nutrient pools that shallow roots cannot reach \n\n(Kell, 2012). Even though the density of roots is generally low below 1 m depth \n\ncompared to the topsoil, they are important in reducing nutrient losses by deep \n\ndrainage (Laclau et al., 2010) and improving trees\u2019 drought tolerance to drought \n\n(Christina et al., 2017a; McDowell et al., 2008). While the effects of environmental \n\nchanges on the phenology of aboveground plant components are well documented, \n\nbelowground processes remain poorly understood (Radville et al., 2016b). The lack of \n\ninformation on the influence of interspecific interactions on root exploration at great \n\ndepth limits our ability to identify the most appropriate sites for multi-species \n\nplantations in tropical regions. Fine-root biomass in the 0-2 m soil layers was found to \n\nbe 30% higher in a mixed-species plantation of E. grandis and A. mangium trees than \n\nin monospecific stands at age 5 years in Brazil (Laclau et al., 2013c). Interaction \n\nbetween the two-species led to a segregation of the root systems. In mixed stands, A. \n\nmangium fine roots were partially excluded from the topsoil in mixture and over-\n\nexplored the soil layers between the depths of 1 and 2 m relative to monospecific A. \n\nmangium stands (da Silva et al., 2009; Laclau et al., 2013c). However, as far as we \n\nare aware, the effects of the inter-specific interaction on fine-root densities at depths > \n\n2 m have never been studied. Changes in fine-root traits might be a major adaptation \n\nof A. mangium and E. grandis trees to cope with inter-specific interactions in mixed \n\nstands. Strong modifications of fine-root morphology have been shown in response to \n\ncompetition through an increase in specific root length (SRL, fine-root length divided \n\nby fine-root dry mass) and specific root area (SRA, fine-root area divided by fine-root \n\ndry mass) to reduce the cost/benefit ratio of resource capture.  \n\nRoot growth is controlled by endogenous constraints on carbon availability and \n\nenvironmental factors (Freschet et al., 2017; McCormack et al., 2015). Fine-root \n\nproduction is dependent on soil water content (Canham et al., 2015) and the high \n\nplasticity of fine roots enables them to explore resource-rich soil patches has been \n\ndemonstrated (Hodge, 2004). The capacity of A. mangium and E. grandis roots to \n\nexplore soil patches might therefore vary depending on the season and the depth in \n\n\n\n228 \n \n\n \n \n\nthe soil. Although ingrowth bags have been commonly used to estimate fine-root \n\nproduction in forest ecosystems (Brunner et al., 2013), the root-free soil in the ingrowth \n\nbags can be richer in nutrients and water than the surrounding soil (without water and \n\nnutrient uptake in the first weeks after installation), which can lead to overestimates of \n\nthe fine-root production and length in these soil patches relative to the surrounding soil \n\n(Bauhus &amp; Messier, 1999; Jourdan et al., 2008).  \n\nOur study aimed to assess the consequences of mixing Acacia mangium and \n\nEucalyptus grandis trees on fine-root growth down very deep profiles in highly \n\nweathered tropical soils. We hypothesized that the interaction between Acacia \n\nmangium and Eucalyptus grandis trees in mixed stands modified root growth relative \n\nto monospecific stands, resulting in i) fine-root over-yielding in all the soil layers down \n\nto the water table at a depth of 17 m, ii) modification of common fine-root traits \n\n(diameter, SRL, SRA) for the two species making it possible to increase the area of \n\nsoil resource capture per gram of C invested in fine roots, and iii) a higher capacity of \n\nthe tree roots to explore soil patches in the topsoil than in very deep soil layers \n\nreflecting the decrease in fine-root density with depth. \n\n5.2 Materials and methods \n\n5.2.1 Study site \n\nThe study was carried out at the Itatinga experimental station of University of S\u00e3o \n\nPaulo, Brazil (23\u00b002\u2019 S., 48\u00b038\u2019 W., 860 m a.s.l.). This region has a humid subtropical \n\nclimate (Cfa according to the K\u00f6ppen classification) with an average annual rainfall of \n\n1390 mm (mean from 1990 to 2010), a mean relative humidity of 77% and a mean \n\nannual temperature of 19\u00b0C with a cold and dry season from June to September. The \n\nsoils are Ferralsols (FAO classification) developed on Cretaceous sandstone with a \n\nwater table at a depth of 17 m (Pradier et al., 2017). Sand content was around 85% in \n\nthe topsoil and 75-80% between 1 m and 15 m depth (Maquere, 2008). Soil pHH2O was \n\napproximately 5.5 in the upper 3 m, cation exchange capacity decreased from 18 \n\nmmolc kg-1 in the 0-5 cm soil layer to 2 mmolc kg-1 in the 2-3 m layer, and exchangeable \n\ncation contents dropped below a depth of 5 cm. Full details were given in a previous \n\nstudy (Laclau et al., 2013c).  \n\n \n\n\n\n229 \n \n\n \n\n5.2.2 Experimental Layout \n\nThe trial was a complete randomized block design with 7 treatments and 4 blocks set \n\nup in May 2003 in a site which had been a Eucalyptus grandis plantation from 1998 to \n\n2002 and previously a Eucalyptus saligna Sm. coppice from 1940 to 1998.  The \n\nexperimental layout was described in detail by Laclau et al. (2008) and Le Maire et al. \n\n(2013). There were plots with A. mangium monoculture, E. grandis monoculture and \n\nmixed plantations of A. mangium and E. grandis within each block. Each plot was 30 \n\nm x 30 m with two buffer rows. The seedlings were planted at a density of 1111 trees \n\nha-1 (3 m x 3 m spacing). The trees were harvested at age 6 years (in May 2009) and \n\nonly the harvested boles were removed from the plots. Harvest residues were spread \n\nuniformly over each plot and A. mangium and E. grandis seedlings were re-planted in \n\nNovember 2009 in the same planting rows of the same plots, at 50 cm from the stumps \n\nof the previous rotation.  \n\nOur study was carried out 4 years after replanting in 3 treatments within 3 blocks: A. \n\nmangium and E. grandis monospecific stands (100A and 100E, respectively) and \n\nmixed stands with 50% of each species (50A50E). In the mixed stand, the two species \n\nwere planted alternately in the row and offset adjacent rows (555 trees ha-1 per \n\nspecies). The Acacia mangium seedlings were inoculated with rhizobia strains \n\nselected by EMBRAPA (Agrobiology, Rio de Janeiro) for their N2 fixation capacities. \n\nThe same amounts of P, K, Ca, Mg, and micronutrients were applied the first 18 \n\nmonths after planting in all the plots (no N fertilization). Destructive sampling at age \n\n3.3 years showed that mixing the two species did not lead to higher aboveground \n\nbiomass in 50A50E than the average of the two monocultures. Tree height was about \n\n8 m higher for E. grandis than for A. mangium (Table 1 ). \n\n\n\n230 \n \n\n \n \n\nTable 1 - Main characteristics of the stands at 39 months (mean and standard deviation between blocks, n=3).

Three \n\nreplicates of soil samples were collected at mid distance between 4 adjacent trees \n\n(Figure 1 ) in each plot down to a depth of 6 m and one replicate per plot between the \n\ndepths of 6 m and 17 m (total of 9 samples per treatment in each soil layer down to 6 \n\nm depth and 3 samples between the depths of 6 m and 17 m). At each sampling \n\nposition, soil layers 0-0.5, 0.5-1.0, 1.0-1.5, 1.5-2.0, 2.0-3.0, 3.0-4.0, 4.0-5.0, 5.0-6.0 m \n\nwere collected by digging a square hole of approximately 15 cm x 15 cm area at the \n\nsoil surface (an operator used a tool designed to dig very deep holes, called \u2018cavadeira\u2019 \n\nin Brazil). Only the soil mass sampled was measured accurately, the volume of the soil \n\nsamples extracted using the \u2018cavadeira\u2019 tool could not be measured and was estimated \n\nby multiplying the soil dry mass of the samples by the bulk density in each layer (see \n\nbelow). About 15 kg and 30 kg of soil were collected at each sampling position for \n\nlayers 50 cm and 100 cm thick, respectively. Fresh soil mass was measured in the field \n\n(\u00b110 g) and all the fine roots easily visible were collected. The soil was then \n\nhomogenized and a sub-sample of approximately 0.5 kg in the 0-50 cm soil layer, 1 kg \n\nin soil layers 0.5-1.0, 1.0-1.5, 1.5-2.0, 2.0-3.0, 3.0-4.0 m, and 2 kg in soil layers 4.0-5.0 \n\nand 5.0-6.0 m was taken to separate short lengths of root and small diameter fine roots \n\nin the laboratory. Each sub-sample was weighed in the laboratory and the soil water \n\ncontent was measured (by drying 5 g of soil at 105\u00b0C for 72 hours).  \n\nBelow a depth of 6 m, soil cores were taken every 1 m depth using a cylindrical auger \n\nwith an inner diameter of 9 cm and a length of 30 cm. We used the same methodology \n\nas Christina et al. (2011a) to avoid contamination of the soil samples collected at depth \n\nby roots from the upper layers. Only soil blocks from the inner part of the auger were \n\ncollected and all fragmented soil pieces likely to come from upper soil layers were \n\nsystematically discarded. All the soil collected from each layer was put in plastic bag, \n\nidentified and stored at 4\u00b0C until processing (within 2 months after sampling). \n\n  \n\n\n\n232 \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1 - Layout of the three treatments studied: Acacia mangium and Eucalyptus \ngrandis monospecific stands (100A and 100E, respectively) and a mixed stand with \n50% of each species (50A50E). A. mangium trees are represented by grey circles and \nE. grandis trees by black triangles. Each inner plot (excluding two buffer rows) is \ndelimited by a grey square. Three replicates samples (position indicated by a red cross) \nof soil cores were collected at mid distance between 4 adjacent trees in each plot down \nto a depth of 6 m and one sample per plot between the depths of 6 m and 17 m. Only \none block is presented. A complete scheme of the trial is presented on Fig. 1 in Le \nMaire et al. (2013). \n\n \n\nAll the fine roots in the samples were washed free of soil with tap water using sieves \n\n(with mesh sizes from 0.50 to 1.19 mm) and all the living roots with a length >1 cm \n\nwere separated carefully by hand. Dead roots separated by sight, touch and flotation, \n\nif required were discarded. Living roots were selected by various criteria such as living \n\nstele, bright color and elasticity. The color of the roots and the ramification pattern were \n\ngood indications of the species to which they belonged. Reference roots sampled in \n\nmonospecific stands were used to facilitate the identification of each species for roots \n\ncollected in the 50A50E treatment. E. grandis fine roots were more branched and were \n\ndarker than A. mangium fine roots. A sub-sample (10% of the weight of each soil \n\nsample) was used to estimate the mass of extremely fine roots (pieces of roots less \n\nthan 1 cm in length). Extremely fine roots were separated carefully by hand in a white \n\nbucket filled with tap water. The mass of short root fragments (less than 1 cm in length) \n\nmeasured in 10% of the soil sample mass was multiplied by 10 to estimate the mass \n\nof those root fragments in the whole soil sample. All living fine roots with a length >1 \n\ncm separated from each soil sample were scanned (400 dpi resolution). Nodules were \n\nscanned with the fine roots when they were present. Root lengths and areas were \n\nestimated in each sample using WinRHIZO Version Pro V.2009c software (Regent \n\nInstruments, QC, Canada). Fine roots were dried for 72 h at 65 \u00b0C and weighed (\u00b10.1 \n\n\n\n233 \n \n\n \n\nmg) to estimate specific root length (SRL, length of scanned roots divided by their dry \n\nmass mass, expressed in m g-1) and specific root area (SRA, surface area of scanned \n\nroots divided by their dry mass, expressed in cm2 g-1) in each soil sample. Fine-root \n\nmass density in each soil sample was calculated taking account of the soil dry mass \n\nused for the separation of the fine roots in the field and in the laboratory. Soil bulk \n\ndensities measured in a pit down to a depth of 17 m in each treatment were used to \n\nconvert fine-root mass densities expressed in g of root per kg of soil to g of root per \n\ndm3 of soil in each layer (the same method was used from the soil surface down to a \n\ndepth of 17 m). Fine-root biomasses were computed in each soil layer multiplying the \n\nsoil layer volume (dm3) by the mean fine-root density. Total root length and total root \n\narea in each soil sample were calculated by multiplying the total root dry mass by SRL \n\nand SRA, respectively. Root area index (RAI, surface area of fine roots divided by \n\nsampled soil area, expressed in m2 m-2) and root length index (RLI, length of scanned \n\nroots divided by sampled soil area, expressed in km m-2) (Jackson et al., 1997) were \n\ncalculated for each soil layer in each treatment.  \n\n5.2.4 Root ingrowth bags \n\nFine-root production over two periods of 3 months were studied using cylindrical \n\ningrowth bags constructed from stainless steel with a mesh size of 2 mm, a diameter \n\nof 9 cm and a height of 35 cm. The 3-month periods of root regrowth were selected for \n\nvery fast eucalypt fine root growth, with maximum ingrowth core colonization after 2 \n\nmonths, following a previous study at the same study site (see Figure.5 in Jourdan et \n\nal. (2008)). Three replicates of root ingrowth bags were installed at 4 depths (soil layers \n\n0.10-0.45 m, 1.00-1.35 m, 3.00-3.35 m and 6.00-6.35 m) in the same plots used to \n\nstudy the fine-root densities (three treatments in three blocks) giving a total of 108 \n\ningrowth bags for each period of 3 months. Holes (diameter 15 cm) were made \n\nmanually (using the \u2018cavadeira\u2019 tool) to install the mesh bags at each depth (0.45 m, \n\n1.35 m, 3.35 m or 6.35 m). The bags were filled with the soil from the corresponding \n\nsoil layer and moistened to field capacity after removing all the roots. The flexibility of \n\nthe bags allowed a good contact with the surrounding soil. PVC pipes (diameter of 0.15 \n\nm, length of 0.1 m, 1 m, 3 m or 6 m depending on the depth of the bag) were placed \n\ninto the holes above the ingrowth bags to make possible to retrieve of each bag from \n\nthe surface using a nylon cord attached (Appendix \n\n\n\n234 \n \n\n \n \n\nAppendix 1 ). A plastic bag (with a nylon cord attached) filled with about 2 kg of soil \n\nwas placed between the root ingrowth bag and the bottom of the PVC tube to avoid air \n\ndiffusion from inside the PVC tube to the ingrowth bags that could affect fine-root \n\ngrowth. The top of each PVC tube was hermetically sealed. The mesh size of 2 mm \n\nallowed fine-root growth. After a period of 3 months, the bags were carefully retrieved.  \n\nWe set up additional ingrowth cores at the depths of 0.1 m and 1 m in the buffer rows \n\nof our experiment to check whether fine-roots were torn out when we pulled up the \n\ningrowth cores 3 months after their installation. Destructive soil sampling close to the \n\ningrowth cores showed that most of the fine roots of the two species were sheared by \n\nthe stainless-steel mesh when the core was retrieved, and the biomass of fine roots \n\nnot recovered inside the soil core was negligible. Two periods were studied: from July \n\nto September 2013 (winter) and October to December 2013 (spring). Just after the \n\nbags were retrieve, new bags were inserted at the same place to study the following \n\n3-month period. All the fine roots in the samples were washed free of soil with tap water \n\nusing sieves and separated carefully by hand. The roots of the two species were \n\ndistinguished in the 50A50E treatment as described above. \n\n5.2.5 Statistical analyses  \n\nTwo-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used to assess the effects of \n\ntreatments (100A, 100E and 50A50E) and blocks on fine-root densities (FRD), specific \n\nroot length (SRL), specific root area (SRA), fine-root diameter, root length index (RLI) \n\nand root area index (RAI) for individual soil layers. Individual root biomass \n\nmeasurements within a given soil layer were considered independent since the \n\nsampling positions were located near different trees in each plot. We used linear \n\nmixed-effects models to test the effects of soil depth, treatment, and the interaction \n\nbetween depth and treatment (as fixed effect) on FRD, SRL, SRA, fine-root diameter, \n\nRLI and RAI for the whole soil profile. Blocks were considered as random effects and \n\nresidues were modeled by a first-order autoregressive correlation model to account for \n\nthe correlations between soil depths. A Shapiro-Wilk test was performed on the data \n\nbefore modeling and log-transformation was used when the residuals did not follow a \n\nnormal distribution or were not homoscedasticity. In addition, two-way ANOVAs were \n\ncarried out for each soil layer to compare the FRD of each tree species (E. grandis or \n\nA. mangium) in the mixed stands with 50% of the FRD in the monoculture of the same \n\n\n\n235 \n \n\n \n\nspecies in the same block. The effects of treatments and depth on FRD in the ingrowth \n\nbags were tested using two-way ANOVAs for each 3-month period studied. Post-hoc \n\ndifferences were analysed using Tukey\u2019s post-hoc Honest Significant Difference (HSD) \n\nto determine which means differed significantly between treatments. All calculations \n\nand analyses were performed using the R software version 3.2.2 (R development Core \n\nTeam 2013) and the level of significance was 0.05. Linear mixed-effects models used \n\nthe lmerTest package (Kuznetsova et al., 2015). For the graphical representations, the \n\nmean values and standard errors were calculated from all the replicates (n = 9 down \n\nto a depth of 6 m and n =3 below). \n\n5.3 Results \n\n5.3.1 Fine-root over-yielding  \n\nAuger sampling down to the root front (maximum depth of root observation) showed \n\nthat trees in 50A50E, 100A and 100E exhibited a similar pattern of deep rooting. Fine-\n\nroots densities dropped sharply from the 0-0.5 m layer to the 0.5-1.0 m layer and \n\ndecreased gradually down to a depth of 12 m in 100A and down to the water table at \n\na depth of 17 m in 100E and 50A50E (Figure 2 ). Mixing E. grandis and A. mangium \n\nled to fine-root over-yielding. Fine-root biomass in 50A50E (1127 g m-2) was 44% \n\nhigher than in 100A (780 g m-2) and 58% higher than in 100E (714 g m-2) (Table 2). \n\nFine-root densities were 20-100% higher in 50A50E than in 100E and 100A in most of \n\nthe soil layers and were at least twice as high in 50A50E as in 100A in soil layers 1.5 \n\n- 2 m, 2 - 3 m, 3 - 4 m, and at depths > 8 m. Low fine-root densities at depths > 8 m in \n\n100A were consistent with higher soil water contents in 100A than in 100E and 50A50E \n\n(Figure 2 ). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n236 \n \n\n \n \n\nTable 2 - Total fine-root biomass down to a depth of 17 m and mean specific root length \n(SRL), mean specific root area (SRA) and mean fine-root diameter down to a depth of \n6 m in 100A, 100E and 50A50E at 4 years of age.

The total fine-root \n\nbiomass of A. mangium trees in 50A50E was 54% of the biomass in 100A, whereas \n\nthe planting density was only 50% of that in 100A, with the slightly lower exploration of \n\nthe 0-2 m soil layer than in 100A offset by a higher exploration of very deep soil layers \n\n(Figure 3). E. grandis fine-root biomass was only 2% lower in 50A50E than in 100E, \n\ndespite the stocking density being 50% lower (Figure 3). E. grandis fine-root biomass \n\nin 50A50E was significantly higher than 50% of that in 100E in all layers except 1-2 m \n\nand 4\u20136 m. Even though the fine-root biomass was low between the depths of 9 and \n\n12 m in all the treatments (about 6% of the total fine-root biomass), A. mangium and \n\nE. grandis fine-root biomasses at this depth were 2-3 times higher in 50A50E than in \n\nthe monospecific stands where the stocking density of each species was twice as high \n\n(Figure 3). \n\n  \n\n\n\n239 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3 - Percentages of fine-root biomass in each soil layer in 50A50E relative to the \nfine-root biomass in the single-species stands.

The RLIs in soil layers 0-1 m, \n\n2-4 m, 4-6 m and 9-17 m were significantly higher in 50A50E than in 100A and 100E. \n\nTotal fine-root area index (RAI) was 28 m2 m-2 in 50A50E and was significantly higher \n\nthan in 100A (20 m2 m-2) and 100E (19 m2 m-2) (Figure 5 ).While about 50% of the total \n\nRAI was found in the top 1 m soil layer in 50A50E (12.7 m2 m-2) and 100A (8.2 m2 m-\n\n2), only 22% of the total RAI was found in the top 1 m in 100E (4.2 m2 m-2) and a high \n\nproportion of the total RAI was in the 1-2 m soil layer (5.8 m2 m-2). The RAI at depths \n\n> 4 m was about 6 m2 m-2, irrespective of the treatment. \n\nWhile specific root length (SRL) and specific root area (SRA) were significantly higher \n\nin 50A50E than in the monospecific stands, the mean fine-root diameter was \n\nsignificantly higher in 100A than in 100E and 50A50E (Table 2, Table 3). Down to a \n\ndepth of 6 m, mean values of SRL were 18.0, 20.5 and 34.9 m g-1 in 100A, 100E and \n\n50A50E, respectively, and the mean values of SRA were 268, 254 and 433 cm2 g-1 \n\n(Table 2). Mean fine-root diameter was 0.53 mm in 100A, and 0.47 mm in 100E and \n\n50A50E. Depth had little effect on SRL, SRA and fine-root diameter for either species, \n\nirrespective of the treatment (Figure 4 ). \n\nMixing A. mangium and E. grandis trees led to a significant increase in SRL and SRA \n\nfor the roots of both species (Table 2, Table 3) while the mean fine-root diameter was \n\nsignificantly lower in mixed stands than in monoculture for A. mangium but not for E. \n\ngrandis. SRL and SRA of A. mangium roots were 2 to 6 times higher in 50A50E than \n\nin 100A down to a depth of 2 m while the differences between treatments decreased \n\nat depths > 2 m (Figure 4 ). The highest difference between the A. mangium root traits \n\nin 50A50E and in 100A was in the topsoil. In the top 0.5 m layer, the mean SRL of A. \n\nmangium fine roots was 72 m g-1 in 50A50E vs 11 m g-1 in 100A and the mean SRA \n\nwas 848 cm2 g-1 in 50A50E vs 187 cm2 g-1 in 100A. Even though the mean diameter \n\nof A. mangium roots was higher in 100A than in 50A50E in all the soil layers down to \n\na depth of 6 m, the differences between treatments were not significant in each \n\nindividual layer (Figure 4 ).  \n\n  \n\n\n\n243 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 - Specific root length (a), specific root area (b) and mean fine-root diameter \n(c) in each soil layer for Acacia mangium (left) and Eucalyptus grandis (right) in \nmonospecific stands and in 50A50E.

Surprisingly, the effect of soil depth on \n\nfine-root production in the ingrowth bags was not significant. Fine-root production in \n\nthe ingrowth bags increased by 268% in 100A, 42% in 100E and 33% in 50A50E from \n\nthe first 3-month period (winter, dry season) to the second (spring). Fine-root \n\nproduction was significantly higher in 100E and 50A50E than in 100A. In individual soil \n\nlayers, fine-root production was not significantly different between 50A50E and 100E, \n\nbut significantly higher than in 100A at depths 3-3.35 m and 6-6.35 m in winter and at \n\ndepths 0.1-0.45 m and 1-1.35 m in spring.  \n\n\n\n245 \n \n\n \n\nThe fine-root production of each species in 50A50E and 50% of the production in \n\nmonospecific stands showed a strong seasonality (Figure 6 ). While the production of \n\nA. mangium roots in winter in the ingrowth bags tended to be higher in 50A50E than \n\n50% of that produced in 100A, it was lower in spring.

In \n\nagreement with our first hypothesis, mixing A. mangium and E. grandis trees led to a \n\nstrong fine-root over-yielding in all soil layers down to the water table at a depth of 17 \n\nm. Although fine-root over-yielding has already been reported in the upper soil layers \n\nfor mixed stands compared to monospecific stands (Brassard et al., 2013; Laclau et \n\nal., 2013c; Lei et al., 2012), the opposite has also been reported (Bolte &amp; Villanueva, \n\n2006), and other studies have shown similar fine-root biomasses in mixed and \n\nmonospecific stands (Bauhus et al., 2000; Meinen et al., 2009). A recent global meta-\n\nanalysis across forests, grasslands, croplands and pot systems showed that mixed \n\nstands had, on average 28% higher fine-root biomass and 45% higher annual \n\nproduction than monocultures (Ma &amp; Chen, 2016). The originality of our results come \n\nfrom the strong fine-root over-yielding observed in soil layers at depths > 2 m. \n\nCompetition for water and nutrients with the neighboring trees in mixed stands may \n\nforce the roots to explore and tap deep soil layers (Cardinael et al., 2015; Ma &amp; Chen, \n\n2017). While most of the studies dealing with fine-root distribution in forests have been \n\nlimited to the upper 2 m of soil, 35%, 45% and 50% of the total fine-root biomass was \n\nfound below 2 m in 100A, 50A50E and 100E, respectively. The difficulty of sampling \n\ndeep roots can lead to underestimates of root mass and belowground productivity in \n\ntropical plantations and forests (Maeght et al., 2015b; Pierret et al., 2016b). Studies \n\nquantifying total fine-root biomass down to the root front are scarce for trees growing \n\nin very deep tropical soils. Close to our study site (on the same soil type), the proportion \n\nof fine roots below 2 m depth was 20-30% of the total fine-root biomass down to the \n\nroot front in a sweet orange orchard (Adriano et al., 2017) and 30-60% of the total fine-\n\nroot length, depending on tree age, in eucalypt plantations (Laclau et al., 2013b; \n\nPinheiro et al., 2016a). As commonly reported in forest ecosystems, fine-root densities \n\ndropped rapidly within the first topsoil layers then decreased gradually with soil depth, \n\nwhich corresponds to the distribution of nutrients in soil profiles (Weemstra et al., \n\n2017). Interactions between tree species greatly increase the exploration of very deep \n\nsoil layers in our study, which is likely to enhance the uptake of soil resources. \n\n\n\n248 \n \n\n \n \n\nEstablishing a deep root system can also help tropical trees withstand the prolonged \n\ndroughts that are expected to increase in the future (Christina et al., 2017a; Solomon \n\net al., 2009). A modeling approach in a nearby eucalypt stand of similar productivity \n\nshowed that very low densities of fine roots at depths > 10 m can withdraw substantial \n\namounts of water during dry periods (Christina et al., 2017a). Mixing tree species could \n\ntherefore enhance the resilience of tropical planted forests to climate changes \n\nincreasing the access to water and nutrients stored in very deep soil layers.  \n\nFine-root over-yielding in 50A50E is also consistent with the higher soil respiration \n\nrates relative to 100A and 100E at the end of the previous rotation (Nouvellon et al., \n\n2012b). Roots are a major contributor to soil respiration (Gill et al., 2002; Marsden et \n\nal., 2008) and about 25% of terrestrial net primary production is due to fine-root \n\nproduction and turnover (McCormack et al., 2015). The total belowground C fluxes \n\nfrom 4 to 6 years after planting in the previous rotation of our experiment represented \n\n24%, 26% and 32% of the gross primary production in 100A, 100E and 50A50E, \n\nrespectively (Nouvellon et al., 2012b). Large amounts of C are stored at great depths \n\nin tropical soils (Batjes, 2014) and changes in land use increasing the supply of fresh \n\ncarbon might promote the activity of microbes through a priming effect (Derrien et al., \n\n2014b; Fontaine et al., 2007). The increase in fine-root biomass, by replacing \n\nmonospecific stands by mixed-species, may have consequences on soil carbon \n\nsequestration in deep soil layers that are poorly understood. Further studies are \n\nneeded to assess whether an increase in the release of fresh C in very deep soil layers \n\nresulting from the combination of tree species could contribute to mitigating climate \n\nchange through a sequestration of C or, on the contrary, would promote the \n\nmineralization of ancient C and therefore increase CO2 emissions. \n\n5.4.2 Root strategies in response to intra- and inter-specific interactions \n\nIn agreement with our second hypothesis, the interaction mechanisms between E. \n\ngrandis and A. mangium trees led to large changes in A. mangium fine-root \n\nmorphology. Previous studies at the same experimental site showed that E. grandis \n\ntrees dominate the competition with A. mangium trees capturing more light per tree \n\nand taking advantage of N fixation (Paula et al., 2015). The A. mangium leaves are \n\nbelow the canopy of eucalypt trees in mixed stands and fine roots are partially excluded \n\nfrom the upper soil layer (Laclau et al., 2013c; Le Maire et al., 2013). A. mangium trees \n\n\n\n249 \n \n\n \n\nadopt an intensification strategy (Bonifas &amp; Lindquist, 2009; Lei et al., 2012; Ostonen \n\net al., 2007a) in competition with eucalypts, making it possible to increase the capacity \n\nto take up soil resources for a relatively low investment in belowground biomass. SRL \n\nand SRA of A. mangium fine roots in mixed stands were 2-3 times higher than in \n\nmonoculture, which, in combination with a large increase in FRD, led to a much higher \n\nroot length index and root area index. While some studies in forest ecosystems also \n\nshowed higher SRL and SRA in mixed stands than in monospecific stands, making it \n\npossible to reduce the cost/benefit ratio for resource capture (Beyer et al., 2013; Lei et \n\nal., 2012; Sun et al., 2017; Weemstra et al., 2016), those root traits were similar in \n\nmixed-species plantations and monocultures of A. mearnsii and E. globulus in Australia \n\n(Bauhus et al., 2000). In our study, A. mangium faced competition with E. grandis by \n\naltering the root absorption capacity, much more through morphological adaptations \n\nthan changing the fine-root biomass of each A. mangium tree.  \n\nC starvation affecting the fine root architecture of A. mangium trees dominated by \n\neucalypts as well as changes in mycorrhizal status seem to be potential factors. A \n\nrecent study carried out in the same experiment showed large changes in the \n\nmicrobiological and chemical attributes of soil between the 100A and 50A50E \n\ntreatments (Bini et al., 2013), which suggests that changes in mycorrhizal status might \n\nbe contribute to explaining the effect of eucalypts on the SRL and SRA of A. mangium \n\nroots. However, the mycorrhizal status was not directly measured, and we can only \n\nspeculate about this effect. Differences in nodulation might contribute to explaining this \n\npattern. Indeed, nodule density was much higher in monospecific A. mangium stands \n\nthan in mixed A. mangium and E. grandis stands in the previous rotation at this site \n\n(Bouillet et al., 2008). However, nodules were mainly observed in the 0-50 cm soil layer \n\nand their density was low in the scanned roots. \n\nOur results confirm the fine-root segregation between the two species in the mixed \n\nstand observed for  the previous rotation at this site (da Silva et al., 2009; Laclau et al., \n\n2013c), with a partial exclusion of A. mangium roots from the resource-rich upper soil \n\nlayers in mixed stands and a higher exploration of deep soil layers. However, the \n\nmethodology was less intensive than in the previous studies of this effect (only one \n\ndistance to the trees was sampled here and the 0-50 cm soil layer was not divided in \n\nseveral layers). \n\n\n\n250 \n \n\n \n \n\nEucalyptus grandis trees respond to competition with A. mangium trees through both \n\nan extensification strategy, leading to a sharp increase in fine-root biomass relative to \n\nmonospecific stands, and an intensification strategy, increasing the volume of capture \n\nof soil resources relative to the fine-root biomass. However, the changes in SRL, SRA \n\nand fine-root diameter were non-significant in most of the soil layers, which suggests \n\nthat the contribution of the intensification strategy was low. SRL and SRA values in our \n\nstudy are in the range reported down to a depth of 12 m for four Eucalyptus genotypes \n\nin nearby plantations (Pinheiro et al., 2016a). The total biomass of E. grandis fine roots \n\nwas similar in 50A50E and in 100E despite a stocking density of eucalypt trees twice \n\nas high in 100E, which shows a remarkable plasticity of eucalypt trees to explore a \n\nhuge soil volume, as already shown in Laclau et al. (2013c). In boreal forests, a \n\ncomparison of fine-root production in mixed and single-species stands showed that \n\nfine-root production was correlated with nitrogen concentrations in the soil layers, and \n\nsuggested that an enhancement of N availability in the mixed stands contributed to \n\nincreasing fine-root production (Ma &amp; Chen, 2017). We, therefore, speculate that \n\nfacilitation mechanisms for E. grandis trees planted with A. mangium resulting from an \n\nincrease in soil N availability (Tchichelle et al., 2017; Voigtlaender et al., 2012), could \n\nbe involved in the extensification strategy leading to an increase in soil exploration by \n\nE. grandis fine roots. Such pattern might be pronounced in the superficial soil layers \n\nwhere eucalypt trees benefit from a rapid belowground N transfer from A. mangium \n\ntrees  (Paula et al., 2015). \n\nWhile many studies show that SRL, SRA and fine-root diameter can change depending \n\non soil depth (Bakker et al., 2009; Makita et al., 2011; Maurice et al., 2010; Prieto et \n\nal., 2015), we did not observe clear patterns down the soil profile for either species. \n\nThe same type of study carried out down to the root front in other eucalypt and orange \n\nplantations in Brazil also showed a high variability of SRL, SRA and fine-root diameter \n\nbetween soil layers but without a clear correlation with the depth (Adriano et al., 2017; \n\nPinheiro et al., 2016a). A study carried out in 20 plant communities sampled in tropical, \n\nMediterranean and montane regions showed that some fine-root traits were \n\nsignificantly different between shallow and deep soil layers, but absolute differences \n\nwere small for most of the traits measured (Prieto et al., 2015). Our results suggest \n\nthat E. grandis and A. mangium fine roots in mixed stands reflect an acquisitive \n\nresource strategy (Freschet et al., 2017; McCormack et al., 2015). Further studies in \n\n\n\n251 \n \n\n \n\neucalypt and acacia plantations should examine other important root traits (in particular \n\ntissue density, concentrations of nutrients, cellulose, lignin and carbohydrate) to gain \n\ninsight into the cost to the trees of investing in fine-root production in very deep soil \n\nlayers. \n\n5.4.3 Fine-root production   \n\nEven though the fine-root production of A. mangium and E. grandis trees exhibited a \n\nstrong seasonal variability, the decrease in fine-root density with soil depth did not \n\nmodify the production of fine roots in the ingrowth bags down to a depth of 6 m. This \n\npattern is contrary to our third hypothesis and shows a huge capacity of very deep \n\nroots to explore resource-rich soil patches despite their low density in the soil. The \n\nproduction of fine roots in the ingrowth bags was however much higher for E. grandis \n\ntrees than for A. mangium trees, which is consistent with the faster growth rates of E. \n\ngrandis trees shown both aboveground and belowground (da Silva et al., 2009; \n\nNouvellon et al., 2012b). Fine-root production in the ingrowth bags confirmed the \n\nstrong over-yielding in mixed-species stands relative to the monocultures suggested \n\nby the fine-root densities. However, fine roots sampled in ingrowth bags can be \n\ndifferent from fine roots sampled in undisturbed soil and productions estimated from \n\ningrowth bags should be interpreted with caution (Bauhus &amp; Messier, 1999; Jourdan \n\net al., 2008). Nevertheless, the same ingrowth bags were installed at all the depths in \n\nall the treatments, making it possible to compare the capacity of fine roots to explore \n\nsoil patches. \n\nThe production of A. mangium fine roots in the ingrowth bags was much more affected \n\nby the season (winter vs spring) in the topsoil than in deep soil layers, as reported for \n\nphreatophytic species (Canham et al., 2012). E. grandis trees are better adapted to \n\nthe cold climate in winter at our study site than A. mangium trees, which could account \n\nfor the higher fine-root production in the topsoil in E. grandis monoculture and mixed-\n\nspecies stands than in A. mangium monoculture. A strong influence of exogenous \n\nfactors such as soil temperature and water content (Canham et al., 2015), as well as \n\nendogenous factors such as photosynthate availability, on fine-root phenology is well \n\ndocumented (McCormack et al., 2015). \n\n\n\n252 \n \n\n \n \n\nIn conclusion, our study shows that mixing species can lead to a strong fine-root over-\n\nyielding in very deep soil layers. We demonstrate that E. grandis and A. mangium trees \n\ngrowing in mixed stands can explore more intensively deep soil layers than their \n\nrespective monospecific stands. Studies dealing with deep rooting are needed for other \n\ntree species, soils and climates to assess whether increasing the diversity in tropical \n\nplanted forests could increase their resilience to climate change by providing access \n\nto more soil resources than monospecific stands. A better comprehension of the effects \n\nof fine-root growth and turnover in very deep soil layers on soil carbon stocks is also \n\nneeded to better assess the long-term consequences of afforestation with fast-growing \n\ntree species on the global carbon cycle.  \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nWe are truly grateful to Daise Silva Ferreira for the huge work carried out in the field \n\nand in the laboratory.

Two contrasting water regimes \n\nwere studied to gain insight into the effects of drought periods that are predicted to be \n\nmore frequent over the next decades. The current, natural water regime (+ W) was \n\ncompared to a reduced water regime (-W), simulating a reduction in precipitation of \n\nabout one third. Fine roots and greenhouse gases were sampled down to the water \n\ntable (here located at a depth of 17 m) through large and deep wells, over one year \n\nbefore the clear-cut and two years after harvesting, in coppice-managed plantations \n\nas well as down to a depth of 4 m in a non-harvested plot (NH) serving as a control. \n\nThis study aimed to test four hypotheses: 1/ Eucalyptus trees are able to adapt their \n\nfine root dynamics depending on their environment to better access the soil resources,  \n\n2/ a change in fine root dynamics can occur between the topsoil and deep soil horizons \n\nwhen trees are subjected to drought conditions, 3/ throughfall exclusion can \n\nsignificantly affect greenhouse gas production and consumption within the soil profile \n\nby modifying gas diffusivity, 4/ coppice management increases the efflux of GHG as a \n\nresult of fine root mortality and decomposition of harvest residues. The consequences \n\nof tree harvesting on fine root dynamics and the production of greenhouse gases over \n\nthe first year of the rotation in coppice-managed plantations ask specific questions \n\nnever studied in very deep soil layers. \n\nThrough this work, we wanted to answer four scientific questions: \n\n1. What are the dynamics of eucalypt fine roots, CO2, N2O and CH4 \n\nconcentrations throughout the entire soil profile down to a depth of 17 m? \n\n \n\n2. Are fine root dynamics and fine root traits differently impacted by a change in \n\nwater regime depending on soil depth? \n\n \n\n\n\n262 \n \n\n \n \n\n3. What are the consequences of drought on greenhouse gas production in \n\neucalypt plantations established in deep Ferralsols?  \n\n \n\n4. How clear-cutting affect root production and mortality but also greenhouse gas \n\nproduction in coppice-managed eucalypt plantations? \n\nThe work in this thesis consisted in collecting greenhouse gases down to a depth of \n\n15.5 m, measuring greenhouse gas effluxes, collecting root samples down to the water \n\ntable and monitoring root dynamics over 3 years (Chapters 2 and 3). This approach \n\nprovided original results on fine root dynamics and greenhouse gas production in very \n\ndeep soil layers in coppice-managed Eucalyptus plantation subjected to two contrasted \n\nrainfall regimes. A modeling approach was then used to gain insight into the processes \n\ngoverning CO2 transfer at a local scale but revealed several issues that we could not \n\novercome over the available time of 6 months at the end of the thesis (Additional work). \n\nFinally, this last chapter aims at discussing the results obtained throughout the thesis \n\nand is organized in two parts. In the first one, we discuss the contribution of deep roots \n\nin tree adaptation to drought conditions and the importance of considering the entire \n\nsoil profile when evaluating stand-scale greenhouse gases emissions. In the second, \n\nwe argue, according to an operational point of view, that coppice management might \n\nbe an interesting option in tropical plantations to improve tree tolerance to drought and \n\nstore carbon in deep soil layers.  \n\nScientific discussion: contribution for global concepts \n\nEffect of climate change on forest plantations: Let\u2019s look deeper!  \n\nUnderstanding the effects of climate changes, predicting its potential impacts and \n\nanticipating adaptation is mandatory for the sustainability of fiber and food production \n\nin a context of increasing human population. If greenhouse gas emissions maintain \n\ntheir current increase, climate change may increase the vulnerability of agricultural and \n\nforestry systems and reduce production in some parts of the world. Perennial \n\nplantations will be particularly affected by climate change, because a plot planted today \n\nmust be able to cope with all the climatic conditions that will be encountered up to tree \n\nharvest, from a few years to several decades after planting. Predicting accurately the \n\nfuture climate is challenging. It requires complex models that consider many processes \n\nthat can potentially greatly influence the predictions when the model is sensitive to \n\nsome parameters. Yet, many processes are still not completely understood for deep \n\n\n\n263 \n \n\n \n\nrooted species, especially for the ones occurring at great soil depth. Deep rooting is \n\ncommon in tropical forests (CANADELL et al., 1996; JACKSON et al., 2000; NEPSTAD \n\net al., 1994)  where severe drought events are predicted to occur over the next \n\ndecades. In tropical forest plantations, it is then crucial to focus the research efforts on \n\nthe understanding of deep soil processes to assess the potential impacts of climate \n\nchanges.  \n\nCurrent climate models predict a reduction in rainfall associated with an intensification \n\nof dry seasons in many parts of the word, and in Brazil particularly. Assessing how \n\ntrees will adapt to climate changes is a major challenge. Therefore, field \n\nexperimentations simulating future climates are crucial to parameterize \n\nbiogeochemical global models making it possible to predict how ecosystems will \n\nrespond to climate changes. \n\nAnthropogenic climate changes are caused mainly by greenhouse gas (GHG) \n\nemissions. GHGs refer to all gases of natural or anthropogenic origin that contribute to \n\nthe greenhouse effect. Potential efficiency of greenhouse gases regarding global \n\nwarming is highly variable. By definition, the overall global warming potential of CO2 is \n\nequal to 1 and CH4 and N2O are 23 and 298 times more efficient to warm the earth \n\nover a 100-year period as compared to CO2, respectively. In the early 1990s, through \n\nthe multiplication of scientific evidence and international conferences on climate \n\n(including the conference of Kyoto in 1997), the international community has become \n\naware of the potential importance for climate changes of increasing concentrations of \n\nanthropogenic GHGs in the atmosphere (mainly CO2, N2O and CH4) and the need to \n\nreduce them. To reduce the concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere, two types of \n\nactions can be considered: \n\n1. Decrease sources, in other words, reduce the level of GHG emissions. \n\n2. Increase sinks, in other words, favor the transfer and storage of GHGs in other \n\ncompartments where they would be stabilized, for example, in the form of \n\ncarbonate sediments, woody plant biomass and / or stabilized organic matter. \n\nOur study puts forward the need to consider deep soil layers to evaluate both actions. \n\nIndeed, it is mandatory to study deep soil layers in order to quantify accurately C \n\nsource/sink fluxes as part of the global carbon budget. Quantifying C fluxes in deep \n\nsoil layers is needed to improve the biogeochemical models predicting the effect of \n\n\n\n264 \n \n\n \n \n\ndrought periods on greenhouse gas effluxes, and to identify more sustainable \n\nsilvicultural practices for tropical planted forests in a context of climate changes. \n\nLooking deeper to quantify sinks accurately   \n\nOur study in a 2-ha split-plot experimental design manipulating water availability \n\ncontributed to evaluating the impact of rainfall reduction on the productivity and \n\nadaptability of Eucalyptus plantation in a context of global change. Our results clearly \n\nshow that Eucalyptus trees facing drought invest more in belowground biomass to \n\nincrease the exploration of fine roots in deep soil layers (Figure 1 ). This adaptive \n\nstrategy to drought stress of perennial plant species, investing assimilates to develop \n\nthe deep root system, increases the availability of water stored in very deep soil layers \n\nto maintain tree growth during drought periods (CHRISTINA et al., 2017). Furthermore, \n\nthe increased surface of root in contact with soil through an adjustment of fine root \n\nmorphology (SRA, SRL, diameter, Figure 1 ) reflects a significant expression of root \n\nplasticity in response to limited soil resources (FORT et al., 2015; HODGE, 2004; \n\nROUMET et al., 2016).  \n\nA higher investment in deep roots in response to a rainfall reduction might also \n\ninfluence other key processes such as tree functional status (i.e. growth and \n\nsenescence), C rhizodeposition and rhizosphere biogeochemical properties. For \n\ninstance, we found a non-negligible production of greenhouse gases down to the water \n\ntable, probably resulting from the respiration of fine roots and their decomposition at \n\ndepths of more than 10 m. On the other hand, deep roots might also contribute to \n\nsequestrating large amounts of C in soils (PIERRET et al., 2016). We showed that fine \n\nroot biomass increased in deep soil layers when the plantation was subjected to water \n\ndeficit (Figure 1 ). As long-term C sequestration is more likely to occur in deep soil \n\nhorizons than in the topsoil (GILL E BURKE, 2002), the increased C allocation to fine \n\nroots in deep soil layers could have significant role for mitigating global changes.  \n\nConsequently, because changing precipitations can greatly modify C allocation \n\nbetween soil layers, C sequestration must be studied not only the topsoil, but also \n\nthroughout the whole soil profile explored by roots.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n265 \n \n\n \n\nLooking deeper to quantify sources accurately \n\nSeveral studies reported that total below-ground carbon allocations account for 20-\n\n30% of gross primary production in Eucalyptus plantations (EPRON et al., 2012; \n\nNOUVELLON et al., 2012; RYAN et al., 2010). The results of our study emphasize that \n\nEucalyptus roots do not only represent a non-negligible part of the biomass of the trees, \n\nbut also that a large proportion is allocated at great depth, especially under drought \n\nconditions (Figure 2 ). This is particularly of interest considering that plants play a major \n\nrole in sequestrating CO2 from the atmosphere into the soil. In order to assess the \n\ncarbon fluxes from the soil to the atmosphere, we conducted measurements of CO2 \n\nfluxes along the soil profile and at the soil surface. \n\nCO2 productions estimated with the diffusivity model were strongly correlated to the \n\ndistribution of fine root biomass along the soil profile, down to a depth of 15.5 m. The \n\nCO2 production shifted to deep soil layer in response to throughfall exclusion, which \n\ncould be due to a shift of root growth to deep layers likely to enhance tree water supply \n\n(SCHWENDENMANN et al., 2010; SOTTA et al., 2007). When decomposed, a part of \n\nthe dead root tissues is incorporated into the soil organic matter (STRAND et al., 2008). \n\nMicroorganisms can be reactivated in response to the input of fresh organic matter. \n\nSpecialized microorganisms develop rapidly and break down fresh organic matter. \n\nTheir metabolites can activate a second class of specialized microorganisms, in \n\ndormancy, which can degrade the organic matter initially present and stored in the soil: \n\nthis is the \"priming effect\" (FONTAINE et al., 2003). Changes in deep soil conditions \n\nin response to water deficit might affect considerably the functioning and composition \n\nof microbial communities and therefore the production of CH4, CO2 and N2O. A study \n\ndown to a depth of 4 m at the same site showed that total organic C and N \n\nconcentrations in the rhizosphere increased with depth and in response to throughfall \n\nexclusion (PRADIER, 2016). This increase can be explained by two major processes: \n\n(i) the increase in the quantity of organic compounds released by deep roots, and/or \n\n(ii) an identical amount of organic compounds released but a difference in their \n\nresidence time within the rhizosphere (PRADIER, 2016). It is therefore essential to \n\nclarify the functional role of deep roots and associated microbial communities to \n\nestimate adequately the overall C sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions in \n\ntropical ecosystems.  \n\n\n\n266 \n \n\n \n \n\nFurthermore, the production of greenhouse gases shifted over depth under dry \n\nconditions in this study, showing that it is important to simulate the changes along the \n\nentire soil profile in biochemical models to estimate CO2 emissions under future \n\nconditions. Therefore, only considering greenhouse gas production in the topsoil layers \n\nwill not be adequate to evaluate the impact of climate changes in tropical forest \n\necosystems over long time periods.  \n\nOperational discussion: consequences for the management of tropical \n\nplanted forests \n\nEucalyptus plantations are not natural forests and are devoted to the provision of wood \n\nproducts, as viticulture is devoted to wine production or coffee plantations to coffee \n\nproduction. The sustainability of Eucalyptus plantations requires the control of criteria \n\nand indicators of sustainable ecological and social management practices, but also \n\neconomic and institutional aspects. Eucalyptus plantations cover large areas \n\nworldwide, with more than 20 million hectares. The large production of wood in fast-\n\ngrowing plantations helps to reduce the pressure on native forest to supply wood and \n\nespecially the high emissions of greenhouse gases caused by deforestation. However, \n\nmuch remains to be done regarding environmental impacts, sustainable management \n\nand adaptation to global change in order to reconcile production issues and \n\npreservation of natural resources. In this perspective, our study contributes to \n\ndemonstrating that coppice management of Eucalyptus plantations could be an \n\ninteresting trade-off between economic, societal and environmental requirements. \n\nCoppice-managed forest plantations: an option to limit GHG emissions \n\nRegeneration of forest plantation by sprouting is a viable alternative for many \n\nproduction systems. More and more forest companies opt for coppice-managed \n\nEucalyptus plantations instead of systematic replanting for cost and profitability \n\nreasons (GON\u00c7ALVES et al., 2014). About one third of commercial Eucalyptus \n\nplantations in Brazil have been managed in coppice management since 2010 (IBA, \n\n2016). However, the consequences of this type of management on the functioning of \n\ndeep roots have never been investigated in tropical planted forests. \n\nSuch a research effort is a prerequisite to orient the management of tropical planted \n\nforests toward a limitation of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. Our study \n\n\n\n267 \n \n\n \n\nshows that managing the eucalypt plantations in coppice after cutting the previous \n\nstand did not led to an increase in CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions (Figure 2 ). Fine root \n\nmortality was very low the first year after the clear-cut when the plantation was coppice-\n\nmanaged (Figure 1 ). The management in coppice after the clear-cut did not increase \n\nthe production of dead roots and the subsequent release of CO2 resulting to fine root \n\ndecomposition. Furthermore, coppiced-managed plantations are less prone to erosion \n\ncompared to replanted stands because the soil is exposed for a shorter period \n\n(BERHONGARAY et al., 2017). Hence, coppice management might be an interesting \n\noption in tropical Eucalyptus plantations, to help mitigate the increase in CO2, CH4 and \n\nN2O in the atmosphere and to limit soil erosion compared to systematic replanting. \n\nCoppice-managed forest plantations: an option for areas of climatic constraints  \n\nOur study also showed that coppice management for Eucalyptus plantation might be \n\na promising option to face water scarcity. Indeed, we found an intensive root growth in \n\nvery deep soil layers (depth > 14m) less than one year after the clear-cut, with only \n\nfew roots lost by mortality.  These findings are particularly impressive considering that \n\nE. grandis roots typically reach only a depth of 7 m at one year after planting in \n\nsystematic replanting (CHRISTINA et al., 2011; LACLAU et al., 2013). Root production \n\nand maintenance represent a significant cost to a plant\u2019s overall economy.  The \n\nestablishment of a deep root system requires the allocation belowground of large \n\namounts of carbon, which is at the expense of the production of aboveground biomass. \n\nBy maintaining the root system, coppice-managed Eucalyptus plantations preserve \n\nbelowground biomass for the next generation. Our results suggest that the carbon cost \n\nto maintain the root system down to the water table could be lower than shedding roots \n\nand producing new roots when the plantation is coppice managed. Six-year-old \n\nEucalyptus grandis trees in our experiment have enough reserves within the root \n\nsystem, with or without throughfall exclusion, and the appropriate edaphic surrounding \n\nconditions to maintain the fine root biomass after clear-cutting, which probably \n\ncontributed to promoting the early shoot growth (BRUNNER et al., 2015; DRAKE et \n\nal., 2013).  \n\nThe maintenance of a deep root system represents a double \"safety net\" for nutrients \n\nand for water uptake that are taken up throughout the entire soil profile before being \n\nlost for tree growth by deep drainage (MARESCHAL et al., 2013). In tropical \n\n\n\n268 \n \n\n \n \n\nEucalyptus plantations growing on highly weathered soils in regions with rainfall events \n\nof high intensity, deep roots can provide access to large amounts of water stored in \n\nthe subsoil and can play a crucial role in nutrient capture, which is essential to avoid \n\nlarge losses of nutrients leached from the upper horizons (LACLAU et al., 2010). \n\nTherefore, the pre-established root system in coppice-managed plantations can act as \n\na safety net by catching up large amounts of nutrient released after tree harvest and \n\nprobably contribute to reducing the risk of tree mortality during prolonged dry periods. \n\n\n\n269 \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n270 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - Conceptual representation of the influence of A) throughfall exclusion and \nB) clear-cutting on mean specific root area (yellow), total root biomass (orange), mean \ndiameter (green), mean root area index (purple), total root necromass (black) and \nmean specific root length (blue) across deep soil profiles.

The arrows at soil surface \nindicate whether the net gas efflux from soil to atmosphere is positive or negative. \n\n\n\n272 \n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n273 \n \n\n \n\nContributions of the study and perspectives \n\nThe outputs of this work are multiple (Figure 1 , Figure 2 ) To our knowledge, it is the \n\nfirst time that fine root dynamics and greenhouse gas concentrations and productions \n\nare studied down to the water table (here at a depth of 17 m) in Eucalyptus plantations. \n\nThe effects of water deficit in interaction with the consequences of clear-cutting in \n\ncoppiced-managed Eucalyptus plantations have never been studied.   \n\nHowever, further studies dealing with the anatomical, architectural and functional \n\ncharacteristics of fine roots across very deep soil profiles should be carried out. These \n\nstudies would help gain an insight into the potential impact of management practices \n\non C, water and nutrient cycles in tropical regions. A better knowledge of microbial \n\ncommunities in terms of biomass and diversity, but especially in terms of metabolic \n\ncapacity is also needed. Improving our understanding of the factors controlling \n\nmicrobial activity, nutrient and C availability and their interactions in deep soil layers is \n\na major scientific lock to model the global biogeochemical cycles (FIERER et al., 2003; \n\nJONES et al., 2018; SOSA-HERNANDEZ et al., 2018). \n\nFrom a methodological point of view, the field measurements in our study showed the \n\ngreat variability of GHG effluxes and the importance of monitoring the determinants of \n\nthese emissions. Unlike micro-meteorological techniques, the closed-chamber method \n\nis simple, relatively inexpensive and can be installed on any type of field (forest, \n\ncultivated field, grassland ...). Problems related to the use of closed-chambers (leaks, \n\noverpressure ...) can be avoided or minimized by an adapted methodology. The main \n\nlimitation of this technique is the small area covered by the measurement, which may \n\nnot encompass large-scale processes. A large number of samples in each treatment \n\nwere set to catch the potential intra-plot variability, but those sampling efforts required \n\na significant labor load and the measurements remained punctual in time and space. \n\nThe use of automatic chambers allows to better capture the temporal fluctuations of \n\ngreenhouse gas emissions (MAKITA et al., 2018). This is particularly an advantage in \n\nplaces where environmental factors, contributing to the regulation of greenhouse gas \n\nemissions (such as soil temperature), lead to large differences in daytime / nighttime \n\nGHG effluxes. \n\nIn situ measurements are needed to explore the dynamics of greenhouse gas \n\nconcentrations throughout soil profiles. However, manual in situ measurements require \n\n\n\n274 \n \n\n \n \n\na lot of time and resources and are therefore often limited in time and space. Modeling \n\nmakes it possible to interpolate in space and time the data acquired punctually. These \n\ninterpolations are particularly interesting for the greenhouse gas effluxes that are \n\ncharacterized by strong spatial and temporal variations, as observed in this study. The \n\nsensibility of model outputs to specific processes can also be assessed by analyzing \n\nthe differences between experimental and simulated data. Moreover, models can be \n\nused to assess the consequences of contrasting scenarios on greenhouse gas \n\nproduction. Nevertheless, the mechanistic modeling of GHG effluxes still presents \n\nmany uncertainties because the main factors used in the models (mineral N dynamics, \n\nwater contents, organic C contents, soil temperatures, soil pH,\u2026) and their interactions \n\nare not fully understood, in particular throughout deep soil profiles. Understanding how \n\nprecipitation changes, and especially extended drought periods, influence greenhouse \n\ngas production in deep soils is crucial to improve the prediction of terrestrial biosphere \n\nmodels. \n\nWhile many studies continue to consider only the upper 30 centimeters of soil, this \n\nwork highlights the urgent need to study deep soil horizons in a context of climate \n\nchange, not only for the evaluation of the changes in soil carbon sequestration, but \n\nalso to quantify accurately the production of greenhouse gases. Comprehensive \n\nstudies dealing with the microbial ecology of deep soil horizons in response to \n\nenvironmental changes and management practices are crucial to predict the behavior \n\nof huge soil volumes over the next decades. \n\n  \n\n\n\n275 \n \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nALEXANDRATOS, N.
