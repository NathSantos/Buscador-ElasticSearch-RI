Nessa altura n\u00e3o poderia \nimaginar o qu\u00e3o importante aquele momento seria para os anos seguintes \u2013 talvez porque nunca \nantes tivesse ouvido falar de Aracaj\u00fa ou da Bacia de Sergipe-Alagoas. No entanto esse momento \nfoi decisivo e o Brasil, em particular a Bacia de Sergipe-Alagoas, fizeram parte da minha vida di\u00e1ria \nnos anos que se seguiram. Durante este tempo v\u00e1rias pessoas contribu\u00edram directa ou \nindirectamente para esta conquista. Tentando n\u00e3o esquecer ningu\u00e9m, os meus agradecimentos: \n \nAo meu orientador, Duncan Lockhart sem o qual esta tese concerteza n\u00e3o seria a mesma.

Nestes blocos, sete po\u00e7os verticais \nforam completados com sucesso, e em todos, o Embasamento Fracturado (cujas caracter\u00edsticas \nforam provadas atrav\u00e9s do uso da ferramenta de imagem \u2013 Formation Micro Imager ou FMI \u2013 e \nde testes a po\u00e7o aberto \u2013 Drill Stem Tests ou DST) foi o intervalo que apresentou os melhores \nresultados.  \nNesta tese, foi feita uma an\u00e1lise extensiva da estrat\u00e9gia explorat\u00f3ria, desde a aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00edsmica \naos resultados e procedimentos dos po\u00e7os, e uma Estrat\u00e9gia de Explora\u00e7\u00e3o alternativa foi \napresentada como conclus\u00e3o. Esta an\u00e1lise integrou dados provenientes dos sete po\u00e7os realizados \ncom dados do Projecto de Modela\u00e7\u00e3o do Embasamento Fracturado (uma parceria entre GALP e \numa equipa composta por elementos da Universidade de Aveiro, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, \nUniversidade do Algarve e Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico). Neste projecto as equipas utilizaram dados \ns\u00edsmicos (planos de falhas interpretados manualmente) e dados de FMI (a partir dos quais as \nprincipais orienta\u00e7\u00f5es de fractura\u00e7\u00e3o foram extra\u00eddas) para simular um elemento geom\u00e9trico \ncorrespondente ao Embasamento. A essa rede foram aplicados princ\u00edpios de geomec\u00e2nica \njuntamente com modela\u00e7\u00e3o DFN (Density Fracture Network), permitindo simular a \npermeabilidade de fractura para cada uma das fam\u00edlias extra\u00eddas dos dados de FMI. Estes dados \npermitiram ao autor calcular o volume de hidrocarbonetos presentes e simular um po\u00e7o \ndireccional para ser que dever\u00e1 ser efectuado em alternativa os po\u00e7os verticais perfurados at\u00e9 \nagora.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAcknowledgements \n \n\nThis thesis is the closure of a stage that began when; in August 2006 I embarked towards Aracaj\u00fa, \nthe capital of Sergipe State in Sergipe-Alagoas Basin, Brazil. At that time, I was far from imagining \nhow important that moment would be for the following years \u2013 maybe because ever before I had \nheard about Aracaj\u00fa or the Sergipe-Alagoas Basin. However, that moment was decisive, and \nBrasil, and in particular this Basin, were part of my daily life in the years that followed. During this \ntime several people directly or indirectly contributed to this achievement. Trying not to forget \nanyone, I thank to: \n \nMy tutor Doctor Duncan Lockhart, without whom this thesis would not exist in this form. There \nare no words to describe my gratitude for having taught me, guided and corrected me during this \ntime. I could not ask for better. Thank you very much! \n \nProf. Lu\u00eds Menezes Pinheiro for all the ideas presented for the enrichment of this work, the \navailability that always demonstrated, and the patience of reading it again and again even when \ntime urged.

In these blocks seven vertical wells \nwere successfully drilled, and in all seven, fractured Basement (which was proven by the use of \nFormation Micro Imaging \u2013 FMI \u2013 tool and the results of the Drill Stem Tests - DST) presented the \nbest results.  \nIn this thesis an extensive analysis of the exploration strategy, ranging from seismic acquisition to \ndrilling /testing results and procedures, was made, and an alternative Exploration Workflow was \npresented as a conclusion. This analysis integrated data from the study of the drilling and testing \nprocedures, with data from the Fractured Basement Project (a joint project with Universidade de \nAveiro, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Universidade do Algarve and Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico). In \nthis project the team used seismic data (mainly interpreted fault surfaces) and FMI data (from \nwhich fracture families were extracted), and by applying geomechanical principles together with \nDensity Fracture Network (DFN) modelling created permeability maps per fracture family. This \nallowed the author to calculate the Hydrocarbons Initially in Place (HIIP) and simulate a \ndirectional well to be drilled as an alternative to the vertical wells drilled so far.   \n\n \n\nkey-words: Sergipe-Alagoas Basin, basement, fractures, Naturally Fractured Reservoirs, \nDrill Stem Test, Formation Micro Imager, whole-core Ant-Tracking, seismic attributes, \nwide-azimuth acquisition, directional drilling, underbalanced driling.  \n\n\n\nContents \n\nAgradecimentos  \n\nPalavras-Chave \n\nResumo  \n\nAcknowledgments  \n\nKey-Words \n\nAbstract  \n\nContents  \n\nList of Figures  \n\nList of Tables \n\n \n\n1.

Inside the green squares are the key\n\npoints of the workflow: the identification of the fracture system properties, the well design,\n\nwell results and Pre and Post-Drill volumes calculation. This method involves several sources of\n\ninformation, gathered at different times during the Exploration process. \n\nIt is first important to assess if there is the possibility of the presence of fractures. If it is, then\n\nthe geologist should understand the Fracture System properties. To do that, he can use old\n\nwell data, outcrop data, regional geology, and if available, seismic. Old well data and outcrop\n\nanalysis will give information on the lithology, orientation of fracture patterns and on rock\n\nmechanical properties, which will allow the geologist to derive the Fracture Properties\n\nAffecting Reservoir Performance and how Fractures and Matrix Interact. Regional geology in\n\nits turn will supply the regional tectonic regimes and the structural setting of the area, which\n\nallows for the classification of the Fracture System Origin. Together, data from these three\n\nsources will constrain the Geomechanical Models that allow the creation of DFN models to\n\nsimulate the Fracture System Properties (fracture and permeability distribution) leading\n\nultimately to the classification of the Reservoir Type. If seismic is not available in the first\n\nphase, the analysis of the other data can help on the decision on whether it should or not be acquired and on the parameters to do so. \n\nNotice that emphasis is also given on processing, as complex settings as NFR\u2019s (especially in\n\nBasement contexts) require special processing steps. All these have the ultimate objective of\n\nfinding a suitable well location. Prior to drilling there is the need of calculating HC volumes in\n\nplace. This will be based on the properties simulated by the models, and using parameters\n\ngiven by the previous analysis. Well design will be subjected to the fracture system properties\n\n(orientation and permeability distribution), in terms of orientation as in most cases NFR\u2019s wells\n\nare drilled directional and underbalanced. The evaluation of the wells will give more\n\ninformation about the reservoir properties and consequently help readjusting the models\n\npreviously created as well as accessing Post-Drill Volumetrics. This is an iterative workflow. \n\nFigure 4-2: Amplitude spectra of incident and received waveforms (P-wave) for model that\n\nconsists of four vertically aligned fractures (left) and for model that consists of seven vertically\n\naligned fractures (right) (Boadu, 1997).

(B) Good permeability pressure plot. 131\n\nFigure 6-47: DST-03 pressure plot. The back-pressure did not increase during flow periods, and\n\nthe second build-up curves rose very fast giving the idea that it would not stabilize.\n131\n\nFigure 6-48: DST-04 pressure plot. Notice that there is almost no pressure registered on the\n\nvalves. This is an interval with no permeability. \n132\n\nFigure 6-49: Seismic In-line in depth and Top Ibura depth man on which the position of the\n\nEcho well was based.

The blue arrow indicates the depth\n\nto which the FMI was run. The DST intervals are indicated by numbers 1 to 3 notice that DST-3\n\ntested together the lower Ibura Mb. and the upper Basement. It is therefore impossible to\n\nderive conclusive evidence about either the provenance of the sampled fluids or the pressure\n\ncharacteristics of each individual formation. The correct procedure would have been to test\n\neach formation independently.\n\n136\n\nFigure 6-52: Composite well log for the Echo well at the Muribeca Fm. and Basement levels. 137\n\n\n\nFigure 6-53: Each of the two individualized areas (red and green) has different average transit\n\ntimes and corresponding responses of the sonic and density logs. There is also a sonic spike at\n\n1025m similar to what was registered in Charlie well. Because Charlie well is relatively distant\n\nfrom Echo well, this spike is more likely to represent a transition zone between the altered\n\nupper Basement and the non-altered lower Basement, than an isolated fracture, i.e. it is not\n\nprobable that an isolated fracture extends for such a large area.\n\n138\n\nFigure 6-54: DST pressure plots for the three DST\u2019s performed on the Echo well.

The DST intervals are indicated by numbers 1 to 2.\n148\n\nFigure 6-61: Composite well log for the Fox well at the Muribeca Fm. and Basement levels.\n\nTwo different sections divided by a very visible spike in transit time at around 1025m, can be\n\nidentified in the sonic log within the Basement (Figure 6-62) like in Echo well. The spike is also\n\nnoticeable in the NPorosity and Density logs, and Resistivity also responds differently in the\n\nupper and lower section of the basement. The continuous registration of this spike reinforces\n\nthe hypothesis of it being a transition zone between the altered upper Basement and the non-\n\naltered lower Basement, than an isolated fracture, i.e. it is no probable that an isolated\n\nfracture extends for such a large area.\n\n149\n\nFigure 6-62: As in Echo Well, each of the two individualized areas in Fox well (red and green)\n\nhave different average transit times and corresponding responses of the sonic and density\n\nlogs. There is also a sonic spike at around 1025m similar to what was registered in Charlie and\n\nEcho wells. The continuous registration of this spike reinforces the hypothesis of it being a\n\ntransition zone between the altered upper Basement and the non-altered lower Basement,\n\nthan an isolated fracture, i.e. it is no probable that an isolated fracture extends for such a large \n\narea.\n\n150\n\nFigure 6-63: DST-01 pressure plot. The back-pressure almost did not increase during flow\n\nperiods, and the build-up curves rise sharply but do not stabilize. This indicates very low\n\npermeability in the tested interval\n\n151\n\nFigure 6-64: DST-02 pressure plot.  This plot shows an interval with a reasonable permeability, \n\nas evidenced by the increase in back-pressure during the flow periods and by the rapid \n\nincrease in pressure. The pressure was tending to stabilize in the second build-Up period. The \n\nvery strong blows and the sampled oil cut with gas are consistent with this analysis. Also \n\nshows the well was highly overbalanced.\n\n151\n\nFigure 6-65: Seismic In-line in depth and Top Ibura depth map on which was based the\n\npositioning of Golf well.\n154\n\n\n\nFigure 6-66: Schematic geological section of the Golf well area. 154\nFigure 6-67: Section of the well log at the sandstones of Calumbi Fm. which had good oil \n\nshows. \n155\n\nFigure 6-68: Well log of the lower section of the Golf well. The blue arrow indicates the depth\n\nto which the FMI was performed. Notice the extension of DST-01, and the fact that it has been\n\ndone over Ibura and Basement once again.\n\n156\n\nFigure 6-69: Composite well log for the Fox prospect at Muribeca and Basement level 157\n\nFigure 6-70: Again in Golf Well, each of the individualized areas (red, and green) have different\n\naverage transit times and corresponding responses of the sonic and density logs. There is also\n\na sonic spike at around 1035m (not as clear as in other wells) similar to what was registered in\n\nCharlie, Echo and Fox wells. The continuous registration of this spike reinforces the hypothesis\n\nof it being a transition zone between the altered upper Basement and the non-altered lower\n\nBasement, rather than an isolated fracture, i.e. it is no probable that an isolated fracture\n\nextends for such a large area.\n\n158\n\nFigure 6-71: Golf well DST-01 pressure plot. With only one cycle and a very little volume of oil\n\nproduced (which is not stated in the reports) it is not possible to make any conclusions on the\n\nreservoir pressures or permeability, even tough the pressure stabilized very quicly. Having\n\ntested a very large extension of well, including two different formations, with very different\n\nlithological properties, doesn\u2019t help to evaluation. Only the fact that a very strong gas blow,\n\nwith a 5m flame, was registered at surface allows the interpretation that this is a good\n\nreservoir. Even though no conclusions can be taken on the specific interval that should be\n\nconsidered for future production.\n\n159\n\nFigure 6-72: dynamic and static images from the Basement, showing foliation \u2013 purple\n\ntadpoles \u2013 dipping around 50\u00ba towards NE.

Notice that the\n\nlargest reserves stand in Type 3 reservoirs that account for some of the largest fields in\n\nthe world.

Type 2\n\nreservoirs have also large reserves when compared to Type 1, which reflects the larger\n\nstorage volume associated with matrix porosity (up to 20\u201330 percent in the matrix as\n\nopposed to up to 1\u20132 percent in the fractures). The smallest volumes of HC are\n\nencountered in Type 1 reservoirs, being the largest known field of this type, the Amal field\n\nin Lybia.

Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 1 \n\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\nBasement rocks (any metamorphic or igneous rocks, regardless of age, which are unconformably \n\noverlain by a sedimentary sequence) are not usually seen by the oil industry as having the \n\ncapacity to hold hydrocarbons (HC) in sufficient quantity to be considered a profitable reservoir. \n\nTheir lithological characteristics, with matrix porosity usually close to zero (or inexistent) causes \n\nstorage space to be given only by fractures, placing Basement reservoirs in the category of \n\nNaturally Fractured Reservoirs, having for that reason very specific exploration strategies (full \n\ndiameter coring, directional and underbalanced drilling as well as detailed geological field studies \n\nare crucial) . All this leads most to exploration wells reaching their total depth (TD) when the \n\nbasement rock is intersected, hence not fully evaluating the basement potential for HC storage. \n\nThis procedure is common despite many successful examples of Basement reservoirs around the \n\nworld, of which Bach Ho field in Vietnam, Mara Field in Venezuela and Habban Field in Yemen, are \n\nprobably the most prominent.   \n\n \n\nThe Sergipe-Alagoas, onshore Basin, where GALP Energia holds two exploration blocks, has an \n\nexample of a proven Naturally Fractured Basement Reservoir. In these blocks seven vertical wells \n\nwere successfully drilled, and in all seven, fractured Basement (which was proven by the use of \n\nthe Formation Micro Imaging \u2013 FMI \u2013 tool and the results of the Drill Stem Tests - DST) presented \n\nthe best results.  \n\nIn this thesis an extensive analysis of the exploration strategy, ranging from seismic acquisition to \n\ndrilling /testing results and procedures, was made, and an alternative Exploration Workflow was \n\npresented as a conclusion. This analysis integrated data from the study of the drilling and testing \n\nprocedures, with data from the Fractured Basement Project (a joint project with Universidade de \n\nAveiro, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Universidade do Algarve and Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico). In \n\nthis project the team used seismic data (mainly interpreted fault surfaces) and FMI data (from \n\nwhich fracture families were extracted), and by applying geomechanical principles together with \n\nDiscrete Fracture Network (DFN) modelling created permeability maps per fracture family. This \n\nallowed the author to calculate the Hydrocarbons Initially in Place (HIIP) and simulate a \n\ndirectional well to be drilled as an alternative to the vertical wells drilled so far.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 2 \n\nIn the alternative Exploration Workflow, this author recommends that the following exploration \n\nprocedures should be executed in the future:  \n\n- Detailed geological field studies over the Basement outcrops that are present in the Basin, \n\nin order to better understand the fracture system.  \n\n- Wide-Azimuth Seismic acquisition.  \n\n- Pre-stack seismic processing with detailed velocity analysis. \n\n- Full-diameter cores to be taken from at least one well. \n\n- Drill-Stem Tests to be executed equally in all the wells. Testing the same intervals and \n\nhaving the same mechanical procedures is crucial to understand how the fracture system \n\nbehaves during production. \n\n- Image logs to be run equally in all the wells and to TD.  \n\n \n\nIf the option of drilling another exploration well is taken, then this thesis demonstrates that it \n\nshould be drilled aiming for a specific family of fractures (Family A), which was ranked as the best \n\nfracture family in terms of density, permeability and porosity relative to two other families \n\n(Family B and B1). This well should have a 30\u00ba inclination and should be drilled in the direction of \n\nthe 240\u00ba azimuth in order to perpendicularly intersect the N22\u00baW/60\u00baNE Family A fractures. \n\nUnderbalanced drilling should be considered as a valid option as it became proven by the \n\neconomic simulation, where the increment in cost for drilling a directional and underbalanced \n\nwell was not significant (close to $600K). The benefits of using such techniques are proven by \n\nworldwide analogues, such as Ninotsiminda Field, where a directional well drilled in 2003 \n\nincreased daily production by as much as ten times; or by the more than 100 successfully drilled  \n\nunderbalanced wells in Canada (Lunan, B, 1995). \n\n \n\nThe lack of accurate data (no geological field studies, no coring data and vertical wells mean that \n\nthe fracture system is not fully evaluated) may be considered as a handicap in the way that the \n\nSEAL Fractured Basement was evaluated, and consequently a weakness of the Workflow. Even \n\ntough, and considering that to the present a considerable amount of funds have been spent \n\nwithout relevant results, this author believes that this methodology will allow for an optimisation \n\nof procedures, with the equation cost vs. results to be favourable to GALP. \n\n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

THE SERGIPE ALAGOAS BASIN \n\n \n\n2. 1 INTRODUCTION \n\nThe Sergipe-Alagoas Basin (SEAL) (Figure 2-1), is located in the north-eastern coast of Brazil \n\nbetween the parallels 11 and 9.30. Its onshore part corresponds to a narrow band of about 35 km \n\nwide, stretching for about 350 km in the direction N45\u00baE. The boundary of the basin to the sea is \n\nnot well defined, but it certainly extends beyond the isobathic line of 2000 m, corresponding to an \n\napproximate area of 45,960 km\n2\n, of which around 13.200 km\n\n2\n are emerged.   \n\nFigure 2-1: Brazil\u2019s sedimentary basins (http://ri.ogx.com.br/images/bacias_sedimentares_eng.gif) \n\n \n\nThe SEAL basin is one of the sedimentary basins along the Brazilian coast, formed during the \n\nopening of the South Atlantic in the late Jurassic and Cretaceous, crossing various tectonic \n\ncompartments of the Pre-Cambrian basement. Much of this basement belongs to the Province \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 4 \n\nBorborema (Almeida et.al.1977), represented in the basin by the Sergipe Fold Belt and the \n\nPernambuco-Alagoas Massif, which will be presented in detail ahead. \n\nThis basin presents the most complete stratigraphic sequence of all of the Brazilian Eastern \n\nMargin Basins (Figure 2-2), with 5 sequences, mostly separated by regional unconformities. \n\n \n\n \n\n(unfold next page) \n\n \n\nFigure 2-2: Sergipe Sub-basin Litho-stratigraphic Column (Campos Neto et al., 2007).  \n\n \n\nStructurally, the basin is a half graben dipping to SE (Figure 2-3), and can be divided into four sub-\n\nbasins: sub-basins of Jacu\u00edpe, Sergipe, Alagoas and the Cape sub-basin, with different histories \n\nand distinct tectono-sedimentary infills. The Rio Real River high separates the sub-basin of Sergipe \n\nfrom Jacu\u00edpe sub-basin. The sub-basins of Sergipe and Alagoas are separated by Japoat\u00e3 and \n\nPenedo highs, along the S\u00e3o Francisco River, while the Maragogi high separates the Alagoas sub-\n\nbasin from the Cape sub-basin (formerly considered the southern portion of Pernambuco-Para\u00edba \n\nbasin). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2 TECTONOSTRATIGRAPHIC SEQUENCES \n\nFor locating the following stages and corresponding sedimentary in the stratigraphic record, \n\nplease refer to Figure 2-2. \n\nStage I: this stage is represented by sediments that were deposited in large depressions \n\nassociated with intracratonic basins.  These depressions that extended from West Africa to NE \n\nBrazil, allowed the preservation of part of the Paleozoic sedimentary record. In the SEAL basin the \n\nAracar\u00e9 Fm. (desert, deltaic and shallow marine Permian sediments) and the Batinga Fm. (glacial, \n\nalluvial-deltaic Carboniferous sediments) are examples of such depositional systems. \n\n \n\nStage II (Pr\u00e9-Rift): This stage, which occurred from Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, is \n\ncharacterized by crustal doming as a response to the heating caused by hotspots presence in the \n\ncentral Gondwana. This doming created a series of shallow peripheral depressions that were filled \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

The Candeeiro Fm. (fluvial sandstones), Bananeiras Fm.  (lacustrine red-beds), \n\nand Serraria Fm. (fluvial sandstones), are the examples of such depositional conditions. \n\n \n\nFigure 2-3: A - schematic representation of the structural setting of SEAL basin (Modified from \nFalkenheim,1986); B - schematic geological sections of the SEAL sub-basins.

Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 6 \n\nStage III (Rift): The evolution of the continental break-up was conditioned by the predominant \n\nstructural directions in the cratons and fold belts that formed the Basement of the newly formed \n\nsedimentary basins. Thus, from the most southern margin to the region of the Camamu basin, the \n\nbreak-up was influenced mainly by the lineaments inherited from the Brasilian Orogeny (late \n\nProterozoic), of NE-SW orientation, and  created a long and narrow rift. In the region of the SEAL \n\nbasin these structural lineaments - of which the Pernambuco lineament is a good example - were \n\nperpendicular to the later. This caused the subsidence to be much slower than the adjacent \n\nregions, limiting the crustal extension, and causing this region to be one of the last to detach from \n\nAfrica \u2013 while the rifting was already happening in Berriasian/Valanginian in the southern areas, it \n\nonly occurred in the Albian, in the equatorial basins.  \n\nThe predominant sedimentary processes were of siliciclastic origin in several depositional \n\nenvironments: alluvial, fluvial, deltaic and lacustrine. These were controlled by the normal faults \n\nthat bordered the basin. At the base of the Rift sequence and deposited during the Valanginian \n\nare the deltaic-lacustrine shales with interbedded sandstones of the Feliz Deserto Fm. This \n\ninterval is limited at the top by the Pre-Aratu unconformity.  \n\nFrom the Pre-Aratu unconformity to the end of the Rift stage, the alluvial/fluvial conglomerates of \n\nthe Rio Pitanga Fm. were deposited in the proximal areas of the basin. Distally, however, two \n\ndifferent intervals can be defined. From Hauterivian to Barremian times, the Rio Pitanga Fm. \n\ngrades laterally to the alluvial/fluvial sandstones of the Penedo Fm., and the lacustrine/deltaic \n\nshales with interbedded sandstones of the Barra Iti\u00faba Fm. From Barremian to Aptian times the \n\nRio Pitanga Fm. grades laterally to the Morro do Chaves Fm. coquinas, and the alluvial-deltaic and \n\nlacustrine sandstones and shales of the Coqueiro Seco Fm. At the top of the sequence, the Rio \n\nPitanga Fm. grades laterally to the lacustrine-deltaic shales and sandstones of the Macei\u00f3 Fm. \n\n \n\nStage IV (Transitional):  the separation between the South American and African plates, allowed \n\nthe intermittent entrance of sea water in the elongated gulf created during the rift stage. This \n\nevent marks the beginning of the Transitional stage, and started between the Aptian and the \n\nCenomanian depending on the location.   \n\nThe influx of sea water was controlled by a transversal structural feature between South America \n\nand Africa \u2013 the Rio-Grande Walvis Sea mounts chain \u2013 which worked has a barrier for the water \n\ncirculation between the proto-ocean that was forming and the Austral Atlantic already developed \n\n(Figure 2-4).

From \n\nthe Albian to the Late Cenomanian, the deposition of the predominatly marine sediments, of the \n\nRiachuelo Fm. occurs (In proximal areas the deltaic sandstones of the \u00c2ngico Mb. were deposited, \n\nvarying to the shallow marine oolitic carbonates of the Maruim Mb., and the mudstones and \n\nshales of the Taquari Mb.).

There are \n\nseveral theories for the evolution of the rifting process, but all agree that the structural evolution \n\nof the basin occurred in several phases of extension. The three main hypotheses are:    \n\n\u2022 Lana and Milani (1983): according to these authors the basin evolved in two main stages: \n\nthe initial stage through N45\u00baE sinistral transtension where en-echelon N-S normal faults, \n\nN30\u00baE and N30\u00baW strike-slip faults develop and a second stage characterized by NW-SE \n\nextension where the N30\u00baE faults were reactivated as normal faults.  \n\n\u2022 Falkenhein et al. (1985): this author considers that the basin has undergone three main \n\nstages of rifting corresponding to different stress regimes: (1) a normal faulting regime \n\ndominated by E-W extension, (2) a strike-slip regime in which NNW-SSE strike-slip faults \n\ndeveloped and N-S faults were reactivated, and (3) a normal faulting regime dominated by \n\nNW-SE extension. \n\n\u2022 Chagas et al. (1983) (Figure 2-5): The Chagas theory is presently the most accepted \n\nhypothesis. Through regional mapping these authors concluded that the main extensional \n\nfaults, i.e. the ones that created the large depocenters along their strike, were oriented in \n\ntwo directions \u2013 NS and NE-SW \u2013 which indicated two different stress regimes. Associated \n\nwith the large normal faults others occurred - transversally or orthogonally - which were \n\ninterpreted as transfer faults. Hence, this model considers that there was an initial, purely \n\nextensional, stage of EW direction that generated N-S normal faults and E-W transfer faults; \n\nand a second stage of NW-SE extension that created NE-SW and NNW-SSE normal and \n\ntransfer faults respectively (Figure 2-5).

These are the product of a very complex geological evolution that goes back to \n\nProterozoic ages. Because the focus of this thesis is on Hydrocarbon (HC) exploration on the \n\nmetamorphic basement rocks of SEAL basin, a brief description of its evolution is presented here. \n\n \n\nIn order to understand the evolution of SEAL basin basement rocks we have to go back 1500 \n\nMillion years to the Greenville Orogeny. The Grenville Orogeny was a long-lived Mesoproterozoic \n\nmountain-building event associated with the assembly of the supercontinent Rodinia. Its record is \n\na prominent orogenic belt which spans a significant portion of the North American continent, \n\nfrom Newfoundland to Mexico, as well as to Scotland (Figure 2-6). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2-6: (A): Highlighted in brown is the location of the Grenville Orogen in the Rodinia Supercontinent \n(Levin, 2007); (B): Generalized map showing the location of the Grenville Orogen, including both its \nsubsurface extent and the location of exposed outliers occuring within the Appalachians and its \ncontinuation in Texas and Mexico, in relation to other principal Precambrian lithotectonic elements of \nNorth America.

Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 11 \n\n \n\nThe Grenville Orogeny is thought to have given origin to the Supercontinent Rodinia (Figure 2-7) \n\nwhich, according to present day plate tectonic reconstructions, existed between 1100 and 750 \n\nmillion years ago, in the Neoproterozoic era. Its configuration is still very controversial, but its \n\nbreakup is fairly well understood and believed to have started around 750 million years ago.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2-7: Alternative Neoproterozoic configurations for the supercontinent Rodinia (after Torsvik, 2003) \n\n \n\nAs early as 850 and 800 million years ago, a rift developed between the continental masses of \n\npresent-day Australia, eastern Antarctica, India and the Congo and Kalahari cratons on one side, \n\nand later Laurentia, Baltica, Amazonia and the West African and Rio de la Plata cratons on the \n\nother (Figure 2-7). The first group of cratons would eventually, around 550 million years ago (on \n\nthe boundary between the Ediacaran and Cambrian), fuse again with Amazonia, West Africa and \n\nthe Rio de la Plata cratons in what is called the Pan-African orogeny (Brasilian Orogeny in south \n\namerica context), creating a configuration of continents that would remain stable for hundreds of \n\nmillions of years in the form of the continent Gondwana (Figure 2-8). It is in the fragmentation \n\nand the subsequent collision of the continental masses that lays the key for understanding the \n\nSEAL basin basement rocks. \n\n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

It is the  \n\nsouthern segment of a Brasiliano-age (?600 Ma) continental collision zone which extends \n\nover NE Brazil and continues into Central Africa as the North Equatorial Fold Belt \n\n \n\nIt is this last province that forms the basement in the studied area. For this reason it will be \n\ndiscussed ahead with more detail.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4.1 The Sergipano Fold Belt \n\nThe Sergipano Fold Belt (SFB) borders the NE rim of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton (Figure 2-9). It \n\nrepresents a small southern part of a complex collision zone of much larger proportions. The SFB \n\nis one of the few places in NE Brazil where probable Late Proterozoic low-grade metasediments \n\nare preserved, the main part of the deformed zone being high-grade gneisses or older \n\nmetasediments. Humphrey &amp; Allard (1968), Allard (1969), Allard &amp; Hurst (1969) were pioneers in \n\nsuggesting its continuation to the African continent, and presently the Sergipano Fold Belt is \n\nregarded as the central part of a megaorogen connecting the Oubangides Belt (or North \n\nEquatorial Belt) of Africa, with the Rio Preto Belt in Brazil (Davison &amp; Santos, 1989; Trompette, \n\n1994) throughout the Riacho do Pontal Belt (Jardim de Sa et al., 1992; Jardim de S\u00e1, 1994). This \n\nmegaorogen stretches for more than 2000 Km and is a key element for global reconstructions \n\nwhereby the northern margin of the S\u00e3o Francisco- Congo Craton faced a continuous ocean, the \n\nclosure of which was part of the final amalgamation of western Gondwana about 500Ma ago (cf. \n\nHoffman, 1991; Dalziel, 1992) (Figure 2-9).  \n\n The tectonic evolution of the SFB is interpreted as result of a half graben inversion by a low angle \n\nd\u00e9collement of a listric fault system, in the continental crust (Figure 2-10). This evolution occurred \n\nbetween 670 and 600 Ma Rb/Sr (D\u2019el-Rey Silva, 1995) or between 630-600 Ma U/Pb (Oliveira et. \n\nal., 2006), as a consequence of the frontal to oblique collision between the S\u00e3o Francisco-Congo \n\nCraton and the Pernambuco Alagoas Massif (West African Craton), as mentioned above. This \n\nauthor considers that structurally, the evolution of the SFB can be simplified by the analysis of the \n\nstructural model of D\u2019el-Rey Silva for the Itabaiana Dome area, which is represented in Figure 2-\n\n11.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

(Aptian) \u2013 Figure 2-2 - black shales, with \n\ntype II Organic Matter (OM) and average Total Organic Carbon (TOC) content of 3.5%. The \n\nhydrocarbon generation started between 108 and 67 Ma, and lasts to present day. This source \n\nrock is not present in the entire basin and in most onshore areas charge depends on medium to \n\nlong distance migration. Typically, migration occurs through normal faults to the Carm\u00f3polis Mb. \n\nsandstones, and then laterally to structural highs. \n\nOther proved source rocks are the Barra de Iti\u00faba shales, with hydrocarbon generation starting \n\n115 Ma and lasting to the present day, and the Coqueiro Seco lacustrine shales. It is generally \n\nconsidered that the Ibura Mb shales and the Aracar\u00e9 Fm. black shales are potential source rocks \n\nin some areas. The migration for all the sources in the Pre-Rift and Rift stages is similar to the one \n\nthat occurs for the Macei\u00f3 Fm. source. \n\n \n\n2.5.2 Reservoir and Seal Pairs \n\nThe main reservoirs for the basin are the Carm\u00f3polis Mb. sandstones, sealed by the Ibura Mb. \n\nevaporites and shales, and the Calumbi Fm. turbidite sands, sealed by the encasing shales. \n\nThe secondary reservoirs are the Serraria Fm. Sandstones, sealed by the basal shales of the Barra \n\nde Iti\u00faba Fm., and the fractured and porous carbonates of the Riachuelo and Cotinguiba \n\nFormations, both sealed by intra-formational shales. Ahead it will be demonstrated that the \n\nBasement, which is sealed by the Ibura Mb., evaporites should also be considered a reservoir. \n\n \n\n2.5.3 Trap Styles \n\nFor the fractured Basement and reservoirs of the Pre-Rift and Rift stages, traps are structural. The \n\nCarm\u00f3polis Mb. accumulations occur in mostly stratigraphic traps related with the Pre-Muribeca \n\nunconformity. Traps in the remaining Transitional stage intervals, as well as early Drift stage, are \n\nstructural, mainly rotated fault blocks or structures associated with salt displacement. Finally, the \n\nCalumbi Fm. accumulations occur in stratigraphic or mixed traps. \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

ASSESSMENT OF THE PROBLEM \n\nIn 2005, GALP acquired a set of exploration blocks located in Sergipe-Alagoas Basin \u2013 Sergipe Sub-\n\nBasin. Four exploration wells were drilled in these blocks, all with the Ibura Member carbonates \n\nas the primary objective and the intercalated sandstones of the Calumbi Formation as the \n\nsecondary objective.  The results of the first well demonstrated the potential of the fractured \n\nBasement play and by the time of the fourth well it had become the primary objective. The results \n\nof the four wells proved that the fractured Basement \u2013 together with the similarly fractured Ibura \n\nMember carbonates\u2013 should become the primary objective for future drilling campaigns in the \n\narea.  \n\nThe second drilling campaign, executed in 2010, confirmed the results of the previous campaign. \n\nThree wells were drilled, and in all three, fractured metamorphic basement rock presented the \n\nbest results in the cuttings and when Drill Stem Tested. The results of the two drilling campaigns \n\nin the area had clearly proven the presence of a Naturally Fractured Reservoir, and in particular a \n\nfractured metamorphic basement rock.  \n\nAs a consequence of these findings, GALP created a joint team from Universidade de Aveiro, \n\nUniversidade Nova de Lisboa, Universidade do Algarve and Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico to \n\nstructurally characterize the Basement rock and as a final product create a Discrete Fracture \n\nNetwork and simulate 3D permeability maps. The objective of this project was to provide GALP \n\nwith a better understanding of this complex reservoir, and allow future drilling campaigns to be \n\nplanned in a manner which would best exploit the potential petroleum resources of the area.  \n\nThis thesis integrates all the data and results that the project team has gathered and the analysis \n\nof the drilling and testing procedures with the final objective of providing a technically supported \n\nrecommendation on how future exploration operations in this area should be run, by presenting \n\nan A to Z Exploration Workflow for Naturally Fractured Reservoirs, using SEAL\u2019s Basement as a \n\ncase-study. \n\n \n\n In order to achieve the objective described above the following strategy was used:  \n \n\n- Re-interpretation of the available seismic, focussing primarily on the Ibura Member and \n\nBasement horizons, with detailed fault interpretation in order to achieve a better \n\nunderstanding of the structural setting; \n\n- Creation of new structural maps of the Basement horizon based on the re-interpretation; \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

NATURALLY FRACTURED RESERVOIRS \u2013 AN OMNIPRESENT REALITY \n\n \n\n4.1 INTRODUCTION \n\nTaking into account all the outcrops of sedimentary rocks that a geologist observes along the \n\nyears, it is not likely to find any that is unfractured \u2013 exceptions made to those extremely ductile \n\nrocks, such as salt or certain shales. This happens because; unfractured rocks do not exist! It has \n\nalso been demonstrated that the vast majority of fractures observed in outcrop are not solely the \n\nresult of surface conditions, which means that the fractures that one can observe in outcrop can \n\nalso exist in the subsurface. Therefore, it follows that hydrocarbon reservoirs in sedimentary rock \n\ns(and also in metamorphosed sedimentary rocks) all contain fractures and many are fractured \n\nenough to be treated as fractured reservoirs.  \n\nDespite this, the practice of treating reservoirs as fractured rock masses is not a standard industry \n\npractice. Why?! This author considers that there are several reasons for this: \n\n1. As stated, virtually all reservoirs contain at least some natural fractures. However, the \n\neffect of these fractures on fluid flow is in most cases negligible and the reservoir can be \n\ntreated, from a geological and reservoir engineering perspective, as a \u201cconventional\u201d \n\nreservoir. \n\n2. Most common naturally fractured reservoirs are characterized as hard rock of low \n\nporosity and permeability but still having most of the fluids stored in the matrix rock. The \n\nfractures are only providing the flow paths for those fluids. This means that, for most \n\nfractured reservoirs, the rock matrix accounts for the bulk of the reserves, and that an \n\nimportant part of the exploration strategy - and hence for the selection of prospective \n\ndrilling locations - is the identification of fractured intervals with sufficient matrix \n\nporosity. In such cases it is more common that the traditional exploration approach is \n\nfollowed. Exceptions made for those cases where it is needed to intersect the fractures in \n\norder to assure flow.  \n\n3.  Almost all fractured reservoirs respond in a manner unique to that specific reservoir. That \n\nis, despite the existence of a good, working fractured reservoir classification, each \n\nfractured reservoir responds in its own distinctive way. As a consequence, applying \n\ngeneral rules of thumb to specific fractured reservoirs can be misleading.  \n\n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 24 \n\nFrom this comes that, due to the desire of simplifying technical work and reducing cycle times in \n\nexploration and production, geologists and engineers tend to fall into the fracture denial \n\nparadigm. It is true that fractured reservoirs are more complicated than matrix reservoirs, and \n\nthat they require more time and money to be evaluated correctly, but the problems with this \n\ndenial or avoidance can be serious and include: 1) irreparable loss of recovery factor; 2) primary \n\nrecovery patterns that are inappropriate for secondary recovery; 3) inefficient capital expenditure \n\nduring development; 4) drilling of unnecessary in-fill wells; and 5) improper assessment of \n\neconomic opportunities. To avoid this it is important to determine the effect of natural fractures \n\non the reservoir that we are analysing, so that the exploration strategy can be adequate from day \n\none.  \n\n \n\nThis thesis has the objective of providing a technically supported recommendation on how future \n\nexploration operations should be run, by presenting an A to Z Exploration Workflow for Naturally \n\nFractured Reservoirs (NFR), using SEAL\u2019s Basement as a case-study. As it will be shown ahead, this \n\nbasement rock is a naturally fractured reservoir and therefore traditional exploration approaches \n\ndo not work well here. The present chapter has the objective of presenting the geological and \n\nengineering aspects of Naturally Fractured Reservoirs. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2 DEALING WITH NATURALLY FRACTURED RESERVOIRS \n\nBefore any other consideration is made, it is important to define fracture and fractured reservoir. \n\nBecause this work is dealing with the effect of naturally occurring fractures on reservoir rock, the \n\ndefinition will be restricted to this context. Hence, a reservoir fracture is a macroscopic planar \n\ndiscontinuity that results from stresses (due to deformation or physical diagenesis) that exceeds \n\nthe rupture strength of the rock. Natural fractures may have either a positive or negative effect \n\non fluid flow within the rock (Nelson, 2001). \n\nIf the definition of a reservoir fracture is broad, the definition of fractured reservoir even more so: \n\na fractured reservoir is defined as a reservoir in which naturally occurring fractures either have, or \n\nare predicted to have, a significant effect on reservoir fluid flow either in the form of increased \n\nreservoir permeability and/or reserves, or increased permeability anisotropy (Nelson, 2001). \n\n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 25 \n\nHaving these definitions in mind, we can now approach the way of how to deal with a fractured \n\nreservoir. It is of paramount importance to know what we are looking for and what we have \n\nfound in terms of reservoir properties. For this reason most authors consider that, despite the fact \n\nthat each fractured reservoir has its particularities, a general set of information has to be \n\ngathered to evaluate any Naturally Fractured Reservoir: fracture origin, fracture properties \n\naffecting reservoir properties, fracture/matrix interaction and reservoir typing. Ultimately this \n\ninformation has the objective of supplying a well location. To gather this information the geologist \n\ncan use several sources at different times during the exploration workflow, but if a logical \n\nsequence is followed, this process will be less time and money consuming and results will \n\nimprove. Figure 4-1 represents the exploration workflow suggested by this author for the SEAL \n\nBasement Naturally Fractured Reservoir (NFR), but that can be applied for other similar situations. \n\n \n\n \n\n(unfold next page) \n\n \n\nFigure 4-1 (unfold next page): Proposed workflow for the present study.  Inside the green squares are the \nkey points of the workflow: the identification of the fracture system and its properties (origin, properties \naffecting reservoir performance, fracture-matrix interaction), classification of the reservoir type, well \ndesign, well results and Pre- and Post-Drill volumes calculation. This method involves several sources of \ninformation, gathered at different times during the Exploration process.  \nIt is first important to assess if there is the possibility of the presence of fractures. If it is, then the geologist \nshould understand the Fracture System properties. To do that, he can use old well data, outcrop data, \nregional geology and, if available, seismic. Old well data and outcrop analysis will give information on the \nlithology, orientation of fracture patterns and on rock mechanical properties, which will allow the geologist \nto derive the Fracture Properties Affecting Reservoir Performance and how Fractures and Matrix Interact. \nRegional geology, in its turn, will supply the regional tectonic regimes and the structural setting of the area, \nwhich allows for the classification of the Fracture System Origin. Together, data from these three sources \nwill constrain the Geomechanical Models that allow the creation of Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) \nmodels to simulate the Fracture System Properties (fracture and permeability distribution) leading \nultimately to the classification of the Reservoir Type. If seismic is not available in the first phase, the analysis \nof the other data can help on the decision on whether it should or not be acquired and on the parameters \nto do so. Seismic interpretation - especially fault interpretation - of the available seismic will also help on \nthe understanding of the fracture patterns and will be an input for any reservoir models that are created. \nNotice that emphasis is also given on processing, as complex settings as NFR\u2019s (especially in Basement \ncontexts) require special processing steps.  \nAll these have the ultimate objective of finding a suitable well location. Prior to drilling there is the need of \ncalculating hydrocarbon (HC) volumes in place. This will be based on the properties simulated by the \nmodels, and using parameters given by the previous analysis. Well design will be subjected to the fracture \nsystem properties (orientation and permeability distribution), in terms of orientation as in most cases NFR\u2019s \nwells are drilled directional and underbalanced. The evaluation of the wells will give more information \nabout the reservoir properties and consequently help readjusting the models previously created as well as \naccessing Post-Drill Volumetrics. This is an iterative workflow. The following paragraphs will analyse the \nworkflow in more detail.  \n\n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

This section will describe the data that can be used to \n\naccomplish this objective.  \n\nWell Data: The analysis of well data from past drilling campaigns is very important, as the \n\npresence of fractures might have gone unnoticed due to a lack of awareness of the geologists and \n\nengineers at the time. Well data includes cuttings, well logs, image logs, core data and production \n\ntests results. Some situations might indicate the presence of fractures (Nelson, 2001): \n\n\u2022 Mud losses might be associated with natural fractures, vugs, underground caverns or \n\ninduced fractures and penetration rates can increase significantly while drilling all types of \n\nsecondary porosity.  \n\n\u2022 If from cores the permeability of a formation is 0.1 md, and the well produces 1,000 Bbl/day \n\n(Bbl = Barrels) in an Extended Well Test (EWT), it can be inferred that the rate is the result \n\nof some type of secondary porosity, including fractures.  \n\n\u2022 Consider also the situation where a rock was described by the mudlogger as a crystalline \n\nrock \u2013 hence with no primary porosity \u2013 and good oil shows were detected. Some kind of \n\nsecondary porosity should be inferred and image logs may help clarifying this. \n\n \n\nThe analysis of this data also allows for the early calculation of parameters such as fracture \n\nporosity, permeability and fracture density, helping the geologist to plan future data acquisition \n\nand/or drilling campaigns (Nelson, 2001). Emphasis on how to use Drill Stem Test\u2019s and Image logs \n\ninformation is presented in the Appendix of this thesis. \n\n \n\nOutcrops: A properly conducted outcrop study can probably provide the most useful information \n\non the relation between fractures and the host rock. In other words, outcrops supply valuable \n\ninformation for the calculation of most rock parameters that need to be assessed when \n\ncharacterizing a NFR \u2013 fracture and matrix permeability, fracture density and fracture system \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 27 \n\norientation. The use of outcrops is obviously conditioned to one very simple factor \u2013 their \n\nexistence. Assuming that outcrops are available, the geologist can face two different situations:  \n\n1) the outcrop is the exact same formation as the one that is being targeted \n\n2) the outcrop can be used as an analogue for the targeted formation \n\nIt is obvious that the first situation is much more convenient as it makes the gathered information \n\nmore reliable, but if the correct analogue is chosen, the geologist can extrapolate the data \n\ncollected from that analysis to his own situation.  \n\nOutcrop studies should be conducted with care, taking into account the fact that the exposed rock \n\nwas subjected to the effect of lithospheric unloading (creating joints) and weathering that altered \n\nmany of the rock properties, relative to the same rock in burial conditions. \n\n \n\nRegional Geology: as in any other geosciences study, the regional geological context where our \n\nobject of study is inserted is of paramount importance. It is the regional geological context that \n\nwill determine some of the properties of the rock mass to be analysed. Information on the \n\nlithologies encountered, fault patterns, stress fields (present and past), geodynamic evolution, \n\nand the relations between all of this will allow for fracture system classification in terms of origin \n\n\u2013 which in turn will determine most of the fracture properties such as spacing, length, width and \n\norientation. This knowledge can be used as an input in geomechanical modelling for prediction on \n\nfracture distribution. \n\n \n\nThe facture properties mentioned, fracture morphology, fracture width and permeability, fracture \n\nspacing, origin of the fracture system, the interaction between matrix and the fractures and the \n\nreservoir classification will be discussed in detail ahead.  \n\n  \n\nSeismic Information: If seismic is available, the geologist can use it to obtain valuable information \n\non the structural context of the area \u2013 by mapping horizons and faults \u2013 and even on fracture \n\npatterns - by extracting attributes from the seismic volume or by detailed azimuthal velocity \n\nanalysis on pre-stack data. Both can also be used as an input to constrain any geomechanical \n\nmodelling that is done. If seismic is not available, the analysis of the previous data will help in \n\ndeciding if it should or should not be acquired. Seismic acquisition and processing for Naturally \n\nFractured Reservoirs (NFR) will be described ahead.  \n\n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 28 \n\nFractures can interfere with the propagation of the seismic waves and cause low P and S-wave \n\nvelocities (Vp and Vs),  and lower seismic frequency and quality factor (Q). These characteristics \n\nhelp the interpreter to identify fractures in the seismic record. \n\n? Low Vp and Vs: Fractures lower seismic P and S-wave velocity due to the rock\u2019s secondary \n\nporosity that was caused by the fractures. As fracture density increases, P-wave velocity \n\ndecreases. A plausible explanation for this is that, as fracture density increases, the \n\noverall velocity becomes increasingly more sensitive to the fracture properties and less \n\nsensitive to the intact rock properties (Boadu, 1997). But if the fractures are filled with \n\nminerals (not fluid), the changes in Vp and Vs are dependent on the elastic properties of \n\nthe minerals which filled the fractures. At the same time, Hilterman (1977) states that the \n\ncompressional wave velocity (Vp) for hydrocarbon filled fractures is lower than brine filled \n\nfractures. The Vs of hydrocarbon filled fractures will be slightly higher than brine filled \n\nfractures. \n\n? Fractures also lower seismic frequency and quality factor (Q). The fractures cause a time \n\ndelay in the propagating waveform and act as filter by attenuating the high frequency \n\ncomponents in the spectrum of the waveform (Boadu, 1997)- Figure 4-2. \n\n \n\nFigure 4-2: Amplitude spectra of incident and received waveforms (P-wave) for a model that consists of four \nvertically aligned fractures (left) and for a model that consists of seven vertically aligned fractures (right) \n(Boadu, 1997). As the number of fractures increases, the amplitude of the received waveforms is \nsignificantly reduced and there is also a shift in the peak amplitude towards lower frequency. Source: Sugiri, \nO. I. (2010). \n\n \n\nSurface seismic data has long been used for detecting faults and large fractures, but recent \n\ndevelopments in seismic attribute analysis have shown promise in identifying groups of closely \n\nspaced fractures or interconnected fracture networks.

Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 29 \n\ntechnology allow in many cases the interpreters to determine fracture orientation, anisotropy and \n\nfracture density. One of the greatest strengths of 3D seismic is the dense, regular sampling of data \n\nover the region of interest, providing images that accurately represent the areal extent of the \n\nfeatures. Among the various geophysical techniques available for characterizing faults and \n\nfractures, 3D seismic attributes have proven to be some of the most useful, in particular those \n\nthat are sensitive to reservoir impedance, thickness, or geomorphology. Although there are a few \n\nhundred seismic attributes that are in common use today, post-stack attributes such as dip-\n\nmagnitude, dip-azimuth, coherence and curvature, are the most useful, and proven to work, for \n\nfault/fracture detection.  \n\nAccording to Chopra (2009), the benefits of using these discontinuity seismic attributes are: \n\n1. Easier recognition of detailed geology within a 3D seismic dataset. \n\n2. Interpretation of higher resolution faults/fractures in any orientation without \n\ninterpretation bias. \n\n3. Clearer stratigraphic features for more accurate interpretations \n\n4. Features imaged in a consistent three-dimensional manner \n\n5. Suitable comparison with log data allows confident interpretation of faults/fractures \n\n6. Reduction of exploration and development risk by providing a more accurate \n\nunderstanding of subsurface geologic features recorded by 3D seismic data. \n\n7. Reduces interpretation cycle time and costs by providing a clearer picture of the \n\nsubsurface \n\n8. Added value to existing 3D seismic investment by exploiting the data to its fullest.  \n\n9. Represent a small percentage of the total seismic cost. \n\n \n\nThe main attributes which have proven efficient for fault /fracture detection are, dip-magnitude, \n\ndip-azimuth, coherence and curvature. Notice that the quality of these attributes is directly \n\nproportional to the quality of the input seismic data. So, for extracting more accurate information \n\nfrom seismic attributes, the input seismic data needs to be cleared of all distortion effects, \n\nwhether near-surface or amplitude/phase related. Curvature and coherence attributes are \n\npresently considered to be the most powerful tools to detect fractures. For that reason they will \n\nbe given emphasis here. \n\n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

Similar traces are mapped with high coherence coefficients, while \n\ndiscontinuities have low coefficients. Regions of seismic traces cut by faults, for example, result in \n\nsharp discontinuities of trace-to-trace coherence, resulting in delineation by low coherence along \n\nfault planes. It is essentially a cube of coherence coefficients generated from the input 3D seismic \n\ndata volume that portrays faults and other stratigraphic anomalies clearly, on time or horizon \n\nslices.  An advantage of the coherence cube is that it gives an unbiased view of the features in the \n\nseismic volume. No interpretation is required for viewing them. \n\n \n\nCurvature (Figure 4-5): A group of post-stack attributes that are computed from the curvature of a \n\nspecified horizon or seismic volume. The concept of curvature applied to a specific task is \n\nillustrated in Figure 4-5. There are many curvature measurements that can be computed, but the \n\nmost-positive and most-negative curvature measures are the most useful in that they tend to be \n\nmost easily related to geological structures. \n\n \n\n \n\nPresently, curvature attributes can be computed using the full seismic volume instead of a specific \n\nhorizon. As the name implies, horizon-based curvature is computed directly from a picked seismic \n\nhorizon which in general requires that the data quality be good and that the horizon of interest \n\ncorresponds to a prominent impedance contrast. Horizons picked on noisy surface seismic data or \n\npicked through regions where no continuous surface exists can produce misleading curvature \n\nmeasures. A way of addressing such problems is to spatially filter the horizon picks, with the \n\nobjective of removing the noise and retaining the features of geologic interest (Bergbauer et al., \n\n2003; Chopra et al., 2006). Volumetric curvature begins by first computing dip and azimuth using \n\na small analysis window (9 traces by +/-10 ms for the examples shown in the figures that follow) \n\nfor every point in the 3D volume. By using a vertical analysis window and the analytic (original \n\ntrace and its Hilbert transform) rather than just the original trace, volumetric estimates of dip and \n\nazimuth are in general more robust than horizon-based estimates. \n\n(c)   \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

Tight (short-wavelength) curvature often delineates \n\ndetails within intense, highly localized fracture systems. Broad (long wavelength) curvature often \n\nenhances subtle flexures on the scale of 100-200 traces that are difficult to see in conventional \n\nseismic, but are frequently correlated to fracture zones that are below seismic resolution, as well \n\nas to collapse features and diagenetic alterations (Figure 4-6).  \n\n \n\nThere are two possible explanations why the coherence image of Figure 4-4 b) does not provide \n\nas much detail as the curvature images. The first reason is geological: the faults can progressively \n\nlose throw and eventually become simple flexures; alternatively, there may be sediment drag \n\nalong some of the faults that make them appear to be flexures. The second reason is geophysical: \n\neither the fault has insufficient throw to be resolved as a discontinuity or the velocities are \n\ninaccurate such that the faults are somewhat smeared and therefore only appear to be flexures. \n\nBe they faults or flexures, we might anticipate increased presence of natural fractures near these \n\nlineaments.

To do this correlation, the \n\ninterpreter can manually pick the lineaments seen on the curvature displays for a localized area \n\naround the borehole, and then transform these lineaments into rose diagrams comparing them \n\nwith similar rose diagrams obtained from image logs. Another way is to generate automated 3D \n\nrose diagrams from seismic attributes and correlate them with other lineaments seen on the \n\ncoherence attribute, for example. \n\nIf by using these attributes the interpreter establishes fracture orientation and distribution, it is \n\npossible to make conclusions about the fracture system origin (the next step in this evaluation \n\nsequence), and save resources evaluating logs and cores. \n\n \n\nBy using these information sources, the geologist is now prepared to make conclusions on the \n\nfracture system itself. These are relative to the fracture system origin and the properties that \n\ninfluence the reservoir performance. In the following sections these topics will be discussed in \n\ndetail. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2.2 Fracture System Origin \n\nUnderstanding the origin of the fracture system has the objective of allowing the interpreter to \n\npredict how fractures will be distributed in the rock volume. The input data for this consists of \n\nfracture dip, morphology, strike, relative abundance, aperture, and the angular relationships \n\nbetween fracture sets. Full-diameter cores (oriented or conventional), borehole imaging logs \n\n(Dipmeter, FMI, CMI), or other less oriented logging tools, can supply this information, which can \n\nthen be applied to one of the existent geological fracture models allowing the extrapolation and \n\ninterpolation of fracture distribution. Geological fracture models, which are postulated from the \n\ncombination of geological and rock mechanics approaches, classify fractures as being: tectonic \n\n(fold and/or fault related), regional, contractional (diagenetic) or surface related (Aguilera, 1998; \n\nStearns and Friedman 1972; Nelson 1979). These models assume that natural fracture patterns \n\ndepict the local state of stress at the time of fracturing, and that subsurface rocks fracture in a \n\nmanner qualitatively similar to equivalent rocks in laboratory tests performed at analogous \n\nenvironmental conditions. This way, natural fracture patterns are interpreted in light of the \n\nlaboratory-derived fracture patterns (Handin and Hager, 1957) and in terms of postulated paleo-\n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

In general, any physical or \n\nmathematical model of deformation that depicts stress or strain fields can, by various levels of \n\nextrapolation, be used as a fracture distribution model (Hafner, 1951; Ode, 1957; and Lorenz and \n\nothers, 1993). \n\nNelson (2001) presents an alternative version to the Stearns and Friedman (1979) model who \n\ndivides fractures into those observed in laboratory experiments and those observed in outcrop \n\nand subsurface settings (Table 4-1). \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4-1 \u2013 Experimental and Natural Fracture Classification (Nelson, 2001, adapted from Stearns and \nFriedman, 1979). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nThe following definitions are simplified from Nelson, 2001 according to Table 4-1.

Shear Fractures: Shear fractures form when all three principal stresses are compressive having \n\na sense of displacement parallel to the fracture plane. They form at some acute angle to the \n\nmaximum compressive principal stress direction (?1) and at an obtuse angle to the minimum \n\ncompressive stress direction (?3) within the rock sample. Potentially, two shear fracture \n\norientations can develop in every laboratory fracture experiment, one on either side of, and \n\noriented at the same angle to ?1.

Extension Fractures: These fractures also form when all three principal stresses are \n\ncompressive and have a sense of displacement perpendicular to and away from the fracture \n\nplane.

Tension fractures: Tension fractures also have a sense of displacement perpendicular to and \n\naway from the fracture plane and form parallel to ?1 and ?2. In terms of orientation of ?1 and \n\nsense of displacement, these fractures resemble extension fractures. However, to form a tension \n\nfracture, at least one principal stress (?3) must be negative (tensile) while to form an extension \n\nfracture, all three principal stresses must be positive (compressive). The distinction between the \n\ntwo is important because rocks have a much lower (10 to 50 times lower) fracture strength in \n\ntension tests than they do in extension tests, an observation that becomes important in \n\nmathematical prediction of subsurface fracturing. Also, it is likely that true tensile fractures only \n\noccur in near subsurface environment, while extension fractures can occur in all low mean stress \n\nsubsurface conditions. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 37 \n\nGeological Fracture Classification \n\nAs stated, the geological fracture classification is based on the assumptions that natural fracture \n\npatterns (conjugate shear and extension or tensile fractures) reliably depict the local state of \n\nstress at the time of fracturing and that subsurface rocks and equivalent laboratory samples \n\nfracture in a manner that is qualitatively similar, when tests are performed at analogous \n\nenvironmental conditions. This means that one can consider that natural fracture patterns reflect \n\nthe same geometry with respect to applied loads as do fractures generated in laboratory \n\nexperiments and naturally occurring fractures can be classified on the basis of the origin the \n\nforces that caused them as determined from laboratory data and fracture system geometry (Table \n\n4\u20131).  \n\n \n\nTectonic Fractures: Tectonic fractures are those whose origin can, on the basis of orientation, \n\ndistribution, and morphology, be attributed to or associated with a local tectonic event. They are \n\nformed by the application of surface forces and form in networks with specific spatial \n\nrelationships to folds and faults. Historically, most hydrocarbon production has been obtained \n\nfrom tectonic fractures. \n\na) Fault Related Tectonic Fractures: Fault planes are, by definition, planes of shear motion. \n\nThe majority of fractures developed in relation with faults are the result of the same stress field \n\nthat caused the fault. These are shear fractures parallel or conjugate to the fault or extension \n\nfractures bisecting the acute angle between these two shear directions (Figure 4-8). The \n\nintensity of fracturing associated with faulting appears to be a function of lithology, distance \n\nfrom the fault plane, amount of displacement along the fault, total strain in the rock mass, \n\ndepth of burial, and possibly the type of fault (thrust, growth, etc.) (Nelson, 2001). Which of \n\nthese parameters will dominate fracture intensity varies from fault to fault. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

The best way to present the \n\ntotal fracture geometry is by using Stearns (1964, 1968a, 1968b) work, resumed in Table \n\n4-2. \n\n \n\nTable 4-2: Fracture geometry of Folds (Nelson 2001; after Stearns, 1968) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 39 \n\n \n\nRegional Fractures: regional fractures are developed over large areas of the earth\u2019s crust with \n\nrelatively little change in orientation, show no evidence of offset across the fracture plane, and \n\nare always perpendicular to major bedding surfaces (Stearns, 1968a, 1968b, 1972; and Nelson and \n\nStearns, 1977). They differ from tectonic fractures in that they are developed in a consistent and \n\nsimple geometry, have a relatively large spacing, and are developed over an extremely large area \n\ncrosscutting local structures. The origin of regional fractures is still dubious but theories ranging \n\nfrom plate tectonics to earth tides (fatigue) have been proposed; however, none have proven \n\nconclusive. Presently they are considered as a result of the application of external or surface \n\nforces (refer to Lorenz et al., 1993; Engelder and Geiser, 1980 for details).  \n\nRegional fracture systems produce hydrocarbons in numerous fields; examples of such are the Big \n\nSandy Field in Kansas and the Altamont-Blue Bell in Uinta Basin, Utah.  \n\n \n\nContractional Fractures: This class is a collection of tension or extension fractures associated with \n\na general bulk volume reduction throughout the rock and are a result of: desiccation; syneresis; \n\nthermal gradients; or mineral phase changes. Details of these processes are not going to be \n\ndescribed as cases of HC production from contractional fractures are not very common except for \n\nthermal contraction fractures, which allow storage in rocks such as basalts (ex.: West Rozel Field, \n\nSalt Lake, Utah). \n\n \n\nSurface Related Fractures: these fractures have not proven to be important in hydrocarbon \n\nproduction to date in other than weathering surfaces. This class includes fractures developed \n\nduring unloading, release of stored stress and strain, creation of free surfaces or unsupported \n\nboundaries, and weathering in general. Surface-related fractures are often developed due to the \n\napplication of body forces. \n\n \n\n4.2.3 Fracture Properties Affecting Reservoir Performance \n\nAfter determining the origin of the fracture system, it is necessary to understand if they represent \n\nan advantage or handicap to the reservoir performance. To do this we need to address the \n\npetrophysical properties of the rock-fracture system. The four petrophysical determinations most \n\nuseful in this evaluation are, in order of increasing difficulty of calculation: fracture permeability; \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 40 \n\nfracture porosity; fluid saturations within the fractures and the recovery factor expected from the \n\nfracture system. These properties are directly dependent on three fracture properties:  \n\n\u2022 fracture morphology,  \n\n\u2022 fracture width and permeability, \n\n\u2022 fracture spacing.  \n\n \n\nFor determining these, core analysis, well tests and image logs are the best methods. Core \n\nanalysis is used to determine reservoir quality and performance by summing the individual small-\n\nscale elements of the reservoir. Well testing, on the other hand, is used to determine the bulk \n\nresponse of a relatively large volume of the reservoir and is a summary of the relative \n\ncontribution of all its individual parts. Image log analysis has been used successfully to delineate \n\nfracture occurrence and distribution in the wellbore. The quantification of the subsurface \n\nreservoir properties such as porosity and permeability of fracture systems by image logs is, \n\nhowever, much more uncertain. For this reasons most authors agree that cores represent the \n\nmost important source of information. \n\n \n\n4.2.3.1 Fracture Morphology \n\nAn important factor that determines fracture porosity and permeability is the morphology of the \n\nfracture planes, which can be observed in core and outcrop and inferred from some well logs. \n\nThere are four Basic types of natural fracture plane morphology (Nelson, 2001): \n\n1. Open fractures \n\n2. Deformed fractures \n\na. Gouge-filled fractures \n\nb. Slickensided fractures \n\n3. Mineral-filled fractures \n\n4. Vuggy fractures \n\n \n\n1. Open Fractures: When the natural fractures are open and have a negligible amount of \n\nsecondary mineralization the hydrocarbons move from the matrix to the fractures in an \n\nunrestricted way. As the name implies, open fractures virtually possess no deformational or \n\ndiagenetic material filling the width between the walls of the fracture. Permeability of open \n\nfractures is a function of:  \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

Deformed Fractures:  formed as a relative ductile shear zone or initially open and subsequently \n\nphysically altered by tectonic shear motions; deformed fractures create strong anisotropy within \n\nthe reservoir. Two types are considered: gouge-filled (Figure 4-10 and 4-12) (deformation bands) \n\nand slickensided (Figure 4-11 and 4-13). Both types reduce the permeability of the fracture.  \n\n \n\n3. Mineral Filled Fractures: these fractures have been filled or constricted by secondary or \n\ndiagenetic mineralization. This secondary cement is usually quartz, carbonate, or both. Its effect \n\non permeability depends on the mineralization grade which can be complete or incomplete \n\ndepending on the diagenetic history of the material (Figure 4-14 and 4-15).  \n\n \n\n4. Vuggy Fractures: vuggy fractures can have very large porosities and several darcies of \n\npermeability. They form when fluid in disequilibrium with the rock matrix enters a low-\n\npermeability rock along fracture planes. This causes dissolution, and vugs to form along and \n\nFunction of the grain size \ndistribution of the host material \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

This means that fractures do not always enhance permeability, as in some \n\ncases they may act as a barrier to fluid flow.  \n\nDespite not being an easy task, there are some indicators that can give the geologist or engineer \n\nclues if the fractures present in a rock, play or not an important role in fluid production:  \n\n\u2022 Direct observation of oil-stained or \u201cbleeding\u201d fracture planes in core samples can \n\nindicate fracture control. \n\n\u2022 High permeability derived from flow tests in zones of relatively low pressure plug (core-\n\nderived) permeability can indicate flow control by natural fractures. \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 45 \n\n\u2022 Fluid flow control can also be revealed by three-directional whole-core permeability \n\nanalysis (Khmax, Kh90\u00ba, Kv) as explained in the previous section. \n\nThe first and general equation for a quantitative description of fluid flow was formulated by Darcy \n\n(1856). This equation was derived for laminar, incompressible, single-phase, Newtonian flow in a \n\ncontinuous, homogeneous, porous material. To summarise, Darcy's law is a simple proportional \n\nrelationship between the instantaneous discharge rate through a porous medium, the viscosity of \n\nthe fluid and the pressure drop over a given distance (Figure 4-16). \n\nDespite being a good approximation for fluid flow across a porous medium, Darcy\u2019s law could not \n\nbe applied to flow along a fracture. Therefore, the theory of parallel flow was developed. Here, \n\nflow is assumed to occur between two smooth parallel plates separated by a distance e (Figure 4-\n\n17).  \n\nThe next logical step was to combine both equations (Darcy\u2019s and parallel plates fluid flow), which \n\nwas made by Parsons (1996). The resulting equation is resumed in Figure 4-18, and it is \n\nconsidered to be a good approximation of total reservoir flow for subsurface reservoirs prior to \n\nproduction (Nelson, 2001 and Jones, 1975). This equation assumes that flow across the \n\nfracture/matrix surface does not alter the flow of either system, which is true for rocks of either \n\nhigh or near nonexistent matrix permeability. This means that, if matrix permeability is high, that \n\nsame matrix will respond individually to the overall pressure gradient rather than to the relative \n\npressure drop of the fracture. If, alternatively, the matrix permeability is close to being null, cross-\n\nflow becomes unimportant. In a rock of relatively low or intermediate matrix permeability, cross-\n\nflow becomes more important and Parsons Equation becomes a poorer approximation of the \n\ntotal flow. There are alternative approximations, but their complexity and the fact that Parson\u2019s \n\nEquation has shown successful in laboratory experiments leads to the conclusion that it is an apt \n\nsemi-quantitative representation of fractured reservoir flow for use in exploration. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n (B) (A) \n\nFigure 4-16: Diagram (A) and formula (B) of Darcy\u2019s Law (1856) which states that the total discharge,  Q  \n(units of volume per time, e.g., m\n\n3\n/s) is equal to the product of the permeability of the medium,  k, the \n\ncross-sectional area to flow, A (units of area, e.g., m\n2\n), and the pressure drop (Pb-Pa), all divided by \n\nthe viscosity, ? (Pa.s) and the length over which the pressure drop is taking place over. The negative sign \nin k is essential because fluids flow from high pressure to low pressure. So if the change in pressure is \nnegative (where Pa > Pb) then the flow will be in the positive 'x' direction.  \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

However, the quantification is complicated due \n\nto the small size of subsurface sampling methods (core and wellbore observations) with respect to \n\nthe fracture spacing or matrix block size. \n\nThe definition which is mostly used in theoretical fracture permeability equations, considers that \n\nfracture spacing is defined as the average distance between regularly spaced fractures measured \n\nperpendicular to a parallel set of fractures of a given orientation (Parsons, 1966). This definition \n\nallows the calculation of fracture spacing by counting the number of fractures along a line of some \n\ngiven length perpendicular to the fracture set of interest, for each of the fracture sets present and \n\ndividing by the length of measurement line (Nelson, 2001).

What is important to understand is the \n\nrelation between these two systems, i.e. how flow communication between the fractures and the \n\nmatrix occurs and how it will condition reservoir productivity. Like matrix porosity, fracture \n\nporosity is the percentage of a particular void volume in a rock mass compared to its total volume. \n\nThe difference lies in the fact that in fracture porosity only those voids occurring between the \n\nwalls of fractures are considered.

Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 50 \n\nrelative to the direction and diameter of the core. For that reason it is important to try to \n\ndetermine general fracture orientation before collecting a whole core. \n\n \n\n Logs: There is no direct method for calculating fracture porosity from well logs. Several authors \n\nhave developed methods to detect natural fracture systems through logs (Aguilera and van \n\nPoollen, 1977; and Aguilera, 1995), but none can calculate ?f directly. Presently, the image tools \n\nallow for this calculation by recording not only the fractures orientation but also their aperture \n\nand intensity (density) which can be used for fracture porosity calculation. However, as the tools \n\nhave a limited radius of investigation within the formation, fracture porosity values cannot be \n\nconsidered absolute. See the Appendix for more details. \n\n \nWell Test Analysis: Pulse tests and transient pressure analysis (see Appendix for details), can be \n\nused for ?f calculation. However, they require close-spaced wells for testing and are usually only \n\napplicable in well-developed areas where production can be ceased in several wells long enough \n\nto perform the tests. Well test analysis is further discussed ahead.  \n\n \n\nNote: Modeling for NFR\u2019s will be presented in Section 5 as part of the implementation of the \n\nworkflow for SEAL Basement Fractured Reservoir. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2.5 Reservoir Classification \n\nOnce fracture origin, fracture properties affecting reservoir performance and fracture/matrix \n\ninteraction has been defined, we can classify the reservoir which we are dealing with. This \n\nclassification is done on the basis of what positive effects the fracture system provides to overall \n\nreservoir quality. Nelson (2001), based on Hubbert and Willis (1955) classification proposes the \n\nfollowing classification (Figure 4-23):  \n\n\u2022 Type 1: Fractures provide the essential reservoir porosity and permeability. \n\n\u2022 Type 2: Fractures provide the essential reservoir permeability. \n\n\u2022 Type 3: Fractures assist permeability in an already producible reservoir. \n\n\u2022 Type 4: Fractures provide no additional porosity or permeability but create significant   \n\nreservoir anisotropy (barriers). \n\nFrom these four types of reservoir, those classified as Type 1, are those where fractures play the \n\nmost important role, by providing both porosity and permeability. For this reason an early \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

Reservoir type IV is outside the box because fractures provide no additional porosity or \npermeability but create significant reservoir anisotropy. M = matrix.  \n\n \n\nFor these estimations, fracture width and fracture spacing values are crucial. For reservoirs of \n\nType 2 and 3 accurate fracture porosity calculations are much less important because the fracture \n\nsystem only provides permeability (porosity or storage volume is given by the matrix). In these \n\nlater cases, the matrix pore volume is usually several orders of magnitude greater than fracture \n\nvolume and overshadows it so much that early calculations of fracture porosity are not important. \n\nHowever it is important to understand how fractures and matrix interact to predict if the fluids \n\nstored in the matrix porosity can be drained through the fractures. Each of these categories has \n\nits particularities, which are better described if we use a table, where examples of each reservoir \n\ntype are also shown \u2013 Figure 4-24 and Tables 4-3 and 4-4. \n\nOne characteristic of fractured reservoirs is that each is a particular case, meaning that even if \n\nthey are of the same Type, they can have very different exploration and production stories. One \n\nexample of such difference is the Edison Field in California and Big Sandy in Kentucky (Nelson, \n\n2001). Both are Type 1 reservoirs, but in Edison Field the fractured Jurassic schist has a 395 m \n\nthick section of producing tectonic fractures formed over a structural high, over an area of 28 \n\n1 2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n100 % ?m \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

As it can be seen from Table \n\n4-4, the difference in reserves between these two shallow, low-pressure fields is dramatic. The \n\nexplanation for such difference is in the horizontal area of the fractured reservoir and in the type \n\nof fractures found. In Edison, fractures are related to the development of the structural high. As \n\nsuch, the fractures are restricted to the size of that structure (7,090 acres). At Big Sandy, however, \n\nthe regional fractures crosscut numerous structures and consequently the area of fracture \n\ndevelopment is very large (650,000 acres). Regional fractures will by definition be developed over \n\nmuch larger areas than tectonic fractures, thus giving the potential for larger reserves in Type 1 \n\nfractured reservoirs. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4-24: Visual representation of the fractured reservoirs classification, with the fractured reservoirs \npresented in Table 4-3 displayed.

Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 55 \n\n4.2.6 Seismic Acquisition for Fractured Reservoirs  \n\nDuring a 3D seismic survey, the main objective is that every subsurface point at the target is \n\nproperly illuminated and has reflected seismic energy with a uniform distribution of source \n\nreceiver offsets, azimuths and incidence angles. Similar to a photographic session in a studio, \n\nseveral light sources are required to fully illuminate the subject being photographed so that an \n\nunblemished and uniformly high resolution image may be possible to capture. The big \n\ndifference between a photographic session and seismic acquisition is that in the later there is a \n\ncontinuously variable medium in all directions \u2013 Earth. This causes energy not to propagate \n\nequally in all directions and in many cases the effects of the Earth\u2019s materials cause such \n\ninfluence in wave propagation that targets cannot be imaged coherently. \n\nFractured reservoirs are an example of a rock medium that causes directional differences in \n\nthe velocity, amplitude, reflection waveform as well as in the phase of the seismic energy. If a \n\nnormal seismic acquisition campaign (Narrow-Azimuth) is implemented, and the inline \n\ndirection is about parallel to the direction of the faults or fractures for example, the final image \n\ncan be poor. To try to solve that problem most surveys try to adjust the inline direction \n\nperpendicularly to the main structural direction, i.e. perpendicularly to the main faults strike or \n\nto the fold hinges. The problem arises when those directions are not clearly known or when \n\nthere are several structural trends caused by differently oriented stresses. In such cases Wide-\n\nAzimuth seismic acquisition might be a solution.  \n\n \n\nThe distinction between narrow and wide azimuth surveys is made on the basis of the aspect \n\nratio of the recording patch. The aspect ratio is defined as the cross-line dimension of the \n\npatch divided by the in-line dimension. Recording patches with an aspect ratio of less than 0.5 \n\nare considered narrow azimuth, while recording patches with an aspect ratio of greater than \n\n0.5 are wide azimuth (Figure 4-25). Wide-Azimuth acquisition is considered superior to narrow-\n\nazimuth in the aspects of image resolution, coherent noise attenuation as well as in other \n\ncharacteristics mentioned below, and that are directly related to fracture imaging (Cordsen \n\nand Galbraith, 1999): \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 56 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4-25: Example of Wide-Azimuth VS Narrow- Azimuth patches. Wide-Azimuth patch consists of 12 \nlines with 60 stations per line, and Narrow-Azimuth patch of 6 lines with 120 stations each (Cordsen and \nGalbraith, 1999). \n\n \n \nImaging: By using single fold 3D data sets with limited extent (e.g. a cross-spread or a shot \n\ngather) Vermeer, 1999, proved that the resolution was dependent on the position of the \n\noutput point with respect to the centre of the data set. This way, by limiting the extent in one \n\ndirection (cross-line) it was possible to obtain different resolutions in the in-line and cross-line \n\ndirections. Combining such data sets did not change these resolution properties. The final \n\ncombined result therefore shows variations in resolution that depend on the period of overlap \n\nof the data sets and the in-line and cross-line offsets of the basic data set (e.g. shot). Clearly \n\nthe best results are obtained from a square patch (equal in-line and cross-line offsets), which is \n\nthe configuration closer to the wide-azimuth patch. Spatial continuity can be enhanced by \n\nmaximizing the extent of the basic data set in all directions. \n\nAnother consideration is that a 3-D shot recorded by a wide patch receives more widespread \n\nsignal (specular reflections) than a narrow patch. Thus for areal geometries, a wide patch \n\nforms more consistent (artifact free) images than a narrow \n\n \nAzimuths: The azimuth dependent trace count proves the more even distribution of source \n\nreceiver pairs for the wide patch (Figure 4-26). The rose diagram (Figure 4-27), where colour \n\nindicates the multiplicity of the occurrence of a particular source\u2013receiver pair (in offset and \n\nazimuth distribution), is extremely focused for the narrow azimuth patch, and shows that for \n\nthe wide patch the source-receiver pairs are much more distributed. \n\nWide-Azimuth Narrow-Azimuth \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

Therefore anisotropy (which means AVO response due to some fractures with \n\ncertain orientations) might go undetected with a narrow azimuth patch.

Source: CGG Veritas \n\n \n\n \n\nWide-Azimuth for fracture detection \n\nIt is widely known that in naturally fractured reservoirs, permeability and therefore production \n\ncan be controlled by fracture networks. These fractures are typically small, sub-vertical and \n\nwell below the resolution of the seismic, so they are not directly observable (SEAL case). \n\nHowever, the cumulative effect of these small aligned fractures is measurable through the \n\nazimuthal variation of seismic attributes. Attributes, such as amplitude, velocity and \n\nimpedance, can be correlated with available fracture data from wells. Literature often \n\nmentions the direct relationship between the magnitude of azimuthal anisotropy, fracture \n\nintensity and permeability. This can be used to derive seismic based fracture intensity \n\nestimates across fields. As it was stated previously, only wide-azimuth seismic is capable of \n\ndealing with situations like these. Seismic azimuthal anisotropy analysis can either be \n\nperformed for specific horizons, or volumetrically for a much larger subsurface interval. The \n\nresults can be visualized in a number of ways, and displays using anisotropy vectors are \n\nparticularly intuitive, making them a powerful tool for interpretation (Figure 4-29). \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

This means that the information VS \n\ncost equation needs to be considered having in mind that any information is only useful if its \n\nvalue is greater than its cost. There is always pressure on saving money but this must be \n\nbalanced against the need to solve the problem. It is also important to remember that \n\nacquisition costs are greater than processing costs, and that technical advances in processing \n\ncan get more out of the data. However processing does not make miracles. If the data is not \n\nacquired properly and imaging is not good, not even the best processing technology will solve \n\nthe problem.

Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 60 \n\n4.2.7 Seismic Processing For Fractured Reservoirs \n\nSeismic acquisition is not a zero-offset operation, i.e. source and receivers are at different \n\nlocations, rock layers are not flat and, unlike sonar, the seismic energy is not directed in the \n\nEarth. Hence, when a geophysicist views the recorded energy from the receiver, he can only \n\nview the energy that was recorded at that location, but has no way of determining where it \n\ncame from in the subsurface. Because of this, seismic data needs to be processed to create an \n\naccurate image of the subsurface. Apart from the processing steps to suppress noise and \n\nenhance signal and resolutuin, such as filtering and deconvolution, there is the need to \n\ngeometrically correct the data, i.e., geometrically reposition the returning signals to show an \n\nevent where it is being hit by the seismic wave rather than where it is being recorded\u2013 this \n\nprocess is called migration. Migration improves the spatial disposition of the reflecting layers \n\nand hence achieves \u2018Imaging\u2019. There are two main types of migration: Post-Stack Migration \n\nand Pre-Stack Migration.  \n\n \n\nPost-Stack Migration: Post-stack migration is the migration done on stacked section (traces \n\nare stacked before migration) as indicated by its name. This migration is based on the idea that \n\nall data elements represent either primary reflection or diffractions. This is done by using an \n\noperation involving the rearrangement of seismic information so that reflections and \n\ndiffractions are plotted at their true locations.  \n\n \n\nPre-Stack Migration: When the subsurface structure is complex, with significant dip variations, \n\nand velocity variation is also complex, reflection events are not hyperbolic and the stacking \n\nprocess does not work very well. Therefore, post stack migration will not give clear results. \n\nPre-stack migration, as the name suggests, is done on pre stack data i.e. on CMP gathers and \n\ncan be done in time or depth domain.  \n\nPre-stack migration is applied only when the layers being observed have complicated velocity \n\nand dip profiles, or when the structures are just too complex to see with post-stack migration. \n\nIt is an important tool in modelling salt diapirs because of their complexity and this has \n\nimmediate benefits if the resolution can pick up any hydrocarbons trapped by diapirs.  \n\nPre-stack migration is applied to avoid amplitude distortions due to CMP smearing and non-\n\nhyperbolic move out. Hence, Pre-stack Time or Depth migration is a valuable tool in imaging \n\nseismic data. In the past, the main constraints on prestack migration were the computation \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 61 \n\nrequirement the time and skill required to construct velocity model within a reasonable time. \n\nAdvances in computing technology and formation of new migration algorithms have eased \n\nthese constraints. \n\n \n\nPre-Stack Migration VS Post-Stack Migration \u2013 Fractured Basement Case \n\nWhen the subsurface structures are simple, post-stack migration works well. But post-stack \n\nmigration is not faithful in areas with complex geology and complex variations in velocities. \n\nPre-stack migration is a better imaging tool which works quite well in areas with complex \n\nstructures and complex velocities.  \n\nRelative to the Fractured Basement in Cuu Long Basin, Vietnam, Huy Ngoc and Quoc QuanThe \n\n(2011), state that applying state of the art \u201cacquisition and processing technology such as \n\nKirchhoff and Beam Anisotropic Pre-stack Depth Migration could provide good imaging not \n\nonly for top of the basement but also for faults inside the basement\u201d. Also in the website of \n\nJapan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (http://www.jogmec.go.jp), it is clearly stated \n\nthat \u201cPSDM is a model-based seismic imaging methodology that works well for complex \n\ngeological structures such as subsalt layers and basement fractures\u201d. \n\nThe above examples prove that using Pre-Stack Migration, especially in Depth domain largely \n\nimproves seismic imaging for Fractured Basement contexts. \n\n \n\nFigure 4-30: comparison between post-stack migration a (left) and pre-stack migration (right); model in \nthe centre.

Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 62 \n\n4.2.8 Drilling Strategies in Naturally Fractured Reservoirs \n\n4.2.8.1 Directional Drilling \n\nTraditional exploration drilling practices are based on three premises: targeting the structural \n\ncrest; maintain a vertical borehole; and drilling over-balanced for safety reasons. All three \n\ndrilling practices may threaten success in naturally fractured reservoirs simply because well \n\nand reservoir flow depends on flow through natural fractures (Ehlig-Economides and \n\nMohamed Taha, 2000). \n\nThe vertical stress from the overburden represents the largest of the three present day in situ \n\nstress directions (the minimum being one of the horizontal directions), which means that most \n\nhorizontal, or near horizontal fractures will tend to close (an example of such are those \n\ngenerated by thrust faulting), and most open \u2013 and therefore most productive \u2013natural \n\nfractures have their planes perpendicular to the minimum stress direction, i.e. they are vertical \n\nor sub-vertical. Thus, what are the probabilities of intercepting a vertical fracture with a \n\nvertical well? Very slim, simply because a vertical well trajectory will be parallel to most of \n\nthose fractures, and hence productivity will be low. A very simple example is shown in Figure \n\n4-30. \n\nIf the reservoir we are dealing is of Type 3 or 4 \u2013 where most of the storage volume is in the \n\nrock matrix \u2013 although not the best option, a vertical well would probably still be able to \n\npresent a reasonable productivity. But if we face a Type 1 or 2 reservoir \u2013 where fractures \n\nsupply the porosity and permeability in Type 1 and permeability paths in Type 2 \u2013 drilling \n\ndirectional wells at an angle from vertical in a direction normal to fracture planes and parallel \n\nto the minimum in situ stress, where most fractures can be intersected is the recommend \n\nstrategy by most authors (e.g. Nelson, 2001; Aguilera, 1995, Ehlig-Economides, 2000). In terms \n\nof wellbore stability, directional wells should not be a problem in most basins, because the \n\nborehole will be encircled by approximately balanced stresses from the overburden and the \n\nmaximum horizontal stress (scenario for relaxed basins).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

Well 3, in its turn was deviated when reached the reservoir interval, and consequently \nintersected a much larger area of fractures (Aguilera, 1983). \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2.8.2 Underbalanced Drilling \n\nIn traditional drilling procedures, the usual practice is to maintain the weight of the mud at such \n\nvalue that the hydrostatic pressure of the mud column exceeds the pressure of the fluids in the \n\npenetrated formations. This differential pressure towards the formation prevents formation fluids \n\nto flow into the wellbore, potentially causing a blow-out. This drilling practice usually alters the \n\nfluid content of the formation near the wellbore, due to the dislocation of the original fluids in the \n\npores by the filtrate in a process known as invasion.   \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 64 \n\nMost water base muds contain solids in suspension, apart from chemicals in solution. When the \n\nmud tries to flow into the pores of the wellbore rock, usually only the filtrate enters, leaving a \n\ndeposit \u2013 the mud cake \u2013 on the face of the rock. In fractured formations this may not be true. \n\nLiterature frequently mentions that when natural fractures are encountered in an overbalanced \n\ndrilling condition, drilling fluids, including solids, penetrate deep into the most open fractures \u2013 \n\nthe most productive \u2013 and the drilling fluid filtrate penetrates the matrix rock facing the invaded \n\nfractures. Besides the danger of losing well control due to lost circulation, the main sources of \n\nproductivity are damaged, possibly permanently. An alternative to this method is to drill at \n\nbalanced or underbalanced conditions, with better results achieved with the second method.  \n\nIn underbalanced drilling the pressure exerted on the well is less than, or equal to, that of the \n\nreservoir. It is performed with a light-weight drilling mud that applies less pressure than \n\nformation pressure preventing the mud to penetrate the formation and avoiding formation \n\ndamage. This negative differential pressure between the reservoir and the wellbore induces \n\nproduction of formation fluids and gases, i.e. flow from the reservoir is driven into the wellbore \n\nrather than away from it in contrast to conventional drilling (Figure 4-31). \n\n \n\nThere are four main techniques to achieve \u201cunderbalance\u201d while drilling a well \n\n(http://www.rigzone.com):  \n\n \n\nLightweight drilling fluids: This is the simplest way to reduce wellbore pressure. Fluids such as \n\nfresh water, diesel and lease crude are used instead of the heavy mud. However, in most \n\nreservoirs the pressure in the wellbore cannot be reduced enough to achieve \u201cunderbalance\u201d by \n\nthis technique.  \n\n \n\nInjecting gas down the drillpipe: this involves adding air or nitrogen to the drilling fluid that is \n\npumped directly down the drillpipe. This technique can be used in wells not specifically designed \n\nfor underbalanced drilling and improves penetration rates. On the other hand, there is a risk of \n\noverbalance conditions during shut-in and very specific tools of measurement while drilling \n\n(MWD) have to be used which may increase the costs. \n\n Note: In air drilling a faster up hole volume is needed because cuttings will fall faster down \n\n the annulus when the compressors are taken off the hole compared to having a higher \n\n viscosity fluid in the hole, at the same time, because air is compressible, Measure While \n\n Drilling (MWD) tools which require an incompressible fluid cannot work.

However this technique \n\napplies constant bottom-hole pressure and requires no operational differences or unique MWD \n\nsystems. \n\n \n\nNitrogen foam: this method is less damaging to formations that exhibit water sensitivities, and \n\nthe safety index is much greater when compared to other methods (nitrogen is inert and \n\neliminating the possibility of down-hole fires). The problem resides in the additional nitrogen \n\nneeded to generate stable foam, which makes this technique very costly. At the same time it can \n\nonly be used in wells measuring less than 3600m deep due to temperature limitations. \n\n \n\nIn sum, Underbalanced Drilling has two main objectives (Leading Edge Training Manual, 2002):  \n\n1. Maximising hydrocarbon recovery \n\n2. Minimising drilling problems \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 66 \n\n1. Maximising hydrocarbon recovery \n\n \n\n\u2022 Reduced formation damage: there is no invasion of solids or mud filtrate into the reservoir \n\nformation, which means that the lithological characteristics of geological formations will be \n\npreserved \n\n\u2022 Early production: Well is producing as soon as the reservoir is penetrated with a bit which \n\ncould be a disadvantage if hydrocarbon production cannot be handled or stored on site or if \n\nthe required export lines are not available, but if the correct procedures are executed then \n\nthis will avoid doing post-drill evaluation tests such as Drill Stem Tests (DST\u2019s \u2013 See \n\nAppendix) and save funds. \n\n\u2022 Reduced Stimulation: Stimulation procedures such as acid wash are proved to reduce the \n\nproductivity of the reservoir. In underbalanced drilling, as there is no filtrate or solids \n\ninvasion, the need for reservoir stimulation is eliminated. \n\n\u2022 Enhanced recovery: The combined effect of the higher productivity of underbalanced wells \n\nwith the ability to drill infill wells in depleted fields, makes possible the recovery of \n\nbypassed hydrocarbons, which can significantly extend the life of a field.  \n\n \n\n2. Minimising drilling problems \n\n \n\n\u2022 Higher rate of penetration: with less pressure at the bottom of the wellbore, it is easier for \n\nthe drill bit to cut and remove rock. \n\n\u2022 Reduced probability of lost circulation: when the well is drilled underbalanced, mud will \n\nnot enter the formation and the problem can be avoided. \n\n\u2022 Elimination of differential sticking: differential sticking is when the drill pipe is pressed \n\nagainst the wellbore wall so that part of its circumference will see only reservoir pressure, \n\nwhile the rest will continue to be pushed by wellbore pressure. As a result the pipe \n\nbecomes stuck to the wall, and can require thousands of pounds of force to remove, which \n\nmay prove impossible. Because the reservoir pressure is greater than the wellbore pressure \n\nin UBD, the pipe is pushed away from the walls, eliminating differential sticking. \n\n\u2022 Extending the life of the drill bit: drilling gases cool the bit while quickly removing cuttings \n\nallowing for a longer usage. \n\n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 67 \n\nIn terms of costs, underbalanced drilling is always more expensive than a regular overbalanced \n\nwell. The costs vary with the complexity of the reservoir and the consequent sophistication of the \n\nequipment required on the surface separation and data acquisition system. The reservoir fluids \n\ndictate the required separation equipment and the reservoir pressure dictate the pressure control \n\nequipment requirements as well as the gas lift requirements (Leading Edge Advantage, 2002). \n\n \n\nLeading Edge Advantage (2002) considers that a value of 10% of the well cost is the additional \n\ncost required for underbalanced drilling by comparing a number of operations in Europe, Canada \n\nand the middle East. They also define a rule of thumb to easily evaluate if the costs will be high or \n\nlow: if the well is expensive because of the complex reservoir geometry, it is likely that the \n\nunderbalanced drilling equipment will also have to be suited to the complex drilling systems \n\nrequired. If a simple vertical well is required in a homogeneous reservoir then the well costs as well \n\nas the UBD costs can be low.  \n\n \n\nIn terms of productivity, they consider that if a multi-well development can be drilled successfully \n\nunderbalanced the reduction in well count (the number of wells drilled to achieve a certain \n\nproductivity) could be as high as 25% as a result of the increased productivity. This benefit \n\noutweighs the obstacles and cost of underbalanced drilling significantly. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

NATURALLY FRACTURED BASEMENT RESERVOIRS A PROVEN \n\nWORLDWIDE PLAY \n \n\nNaturally fractured reservoirs are often ignored due to the increased difficulty in exploration \n\ntechniques. This is even more evident when the cases are basement reservoirs. Despite being \n\nknown within the hydrocarbon industry for many years, naturally fractured basement reservoirs \n\nare generally regarded as non-productive and they have failed to draw the attention of the \n\nexplorationist. These reservoirs are often seen as \u2018of no economic potential\u2019, and their \n\ninvestigation by exploratory drilling has been left to chance. This section is dedicated to \n\ndemonstrate that these types of reservoirs have an underexplored potential, even though they \n\nare commonly distributed in various petroliferous regions throughout the world with many \n\nsuccessful cases. \n\n \n\nBefore any consideration is made on how to explore Basement reservoirs, it is important to define \n\nthe concept of Basement: \n\nBerkley University Geological Glossary: The oldest rocks in a given area; a complex of \n\nmetamorphic and igneous rocks that underlies the sedimentary deposits. Usually Precambrian or \n\nPaleozoic in age. \n\n \n\nWikipedia: rocks below a sedimentary platform or cover, or more generally any rock \n\nbelow sedimentary rocks or sedimentary basins that are metamorphic or igneous in origin. \n\n \n\nLandes (1960): basement rocks are considered as any metamorphic or igneous rocks (regardless of \n\nage) which are unconformably overlain by a sedimentary sequence.   \n\n \n\nP\u2019na (1982): considers two definitions of basement related to HC exploration: \n\n1) metamorphic and igneous rocks (regardless of age) that are unconformably overlain by a \n\nyounger oil-generating formation (source rock). The oil, which is generated from the \n\noverlying sediments, is stored in the older metamorphic and igneous rocks.  \n\n2) any rock that unconformably underlies oil generating or oil-bearing formations. \n\n \n\nAguilera (1980, 1995): does not consider sandstones and carbonates as basement rock, even if \n\nthey conformably underlie oil-bearing or oil-generating formations. \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 69 \n\nNorth (1990): considers basement rocks to include those of sedimentary origin, if they have \n\nessentially little or no matrix porosity. He states that \u2018basement\u2019 should not be compared with \n\n\u2018Precambrian\u2019 and that basement rock may have considerable fracture porosity due to \n\ndeformation, weathering or both. \n\n \n\nFrom the above paragraphs, we can conclude that the definition of basement rock is very broad, \n\nand like most other definitions it depends on the objective and scientific context of the author \n\nwho is giving the definition. Some authors consider basement rock only if it\u2019s not of sedimentary \n\norigin (igneous or metamorphic), but others also include sedimentary rocks if they have little or \n\nno matrix porosity. From this it is obvious that the essential characteristic that a rock must have to \n\nbe considered basement, is the inexistence or the very low matrix porosity. Adding to this it forms \n\nan unconformity with the above sedimentary sequence and it may or not be of Precambrian or \n\nPaleozoic age. In SEAL, the basement is a metamorphic rock, unconformably lying below a \n\nsedimentary sequence and dated from the Pre-Cambrian. For this reason this author considers \n\nLandes definition as the most accurate for the present study. \n\n \n\nCommercial, naturally fractured basement oil deposits have been found largely by accident, when \n\nlooking for other types of reservoir (Aguilera, 1980; Landes et al, 1960). The proof of this \n\naccidental success is that in the Western countries, all the oil fields that produce from crystalline \n\nbasements were discovered when aiming for other formations. Furthermore, most naturally \n\nfractured reservoirs (sandstones, carbonates, cherts, shales and not just basement reservoirs) \n\nwere discovered by accident (Aguilera, 1995, Russell, 1995). In Russia and in other countries from \n\nthe former USSR however, drilling into crystalline basements has been carried out intentionally \n\n(Kenney et al., 1996) for a long time. \n\nLandes et al.; (1960) considers that basement rock oil accumulations shouldn\u2019t be considered \n\nrarities to be found solely by chance but are normal concentrations of hydrocarbons obeying the \n\nrules of origin, migration and entrapment. Therefore, in areas of not too deep basement, oil \n\ndeposits should be sought with the same professional skill and zeal as accumulations in the \n\noverlying sediments. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 70 \n\n5.1 FAVOURABLE CONDITIONS FOR HC ACCUMULATION IN BASEMENT ROCKS  \n\nLike in any other HC reservoir, there a number of favourable conditions that a basement rock \n\nreservoir should have and that are mentioned by several authors (Gutmanis et al., 2005; Aguilera, \n\nseveral articles; Landes et al., 1960):  \n\nRegional Unconformity: because basement rock is not a reservoir rock by nature, i.e. it usually has \n\nlow porosity and permeability; the hydrocarbons have to be present in a typical reservoir rock \n\n(clastic, carbonate) or in the source rock itself before migrating into the basement. For this reason \n\nbasement reservoirs have to underlie a regional unconformity. All basement reservoirs known \n\ncomply with this and almost all lie on an uplift or high. This uplift or high was generally \n\ncontinuously uplifted for long periods of geologic time and was subject to a long period of \n\nweathering and erosion, which sculptured hills in the basement rock and created the differential \n\ngeomorphology. Younger sediments, which act as hydrocarbon sources, either flank or directly \n\noverlie basement providing the opportunity for entrapment of oil in the basement rock. These \n\nyounger sediments may either be a reservoir rock to where HC have migrated, or even the source \n\nrock as in Yemen, where in the Habban field,  Khulan Formation intraformational shales provide \n\nthe source of the HC. \n\n \n\nSeal: It is important that the reservoir is overlain by a seal. In most cases the cap rock for \n\nbasement accumulations is a relatively tight sedimentary rock (Sergipe-Alagoas case, where the \n\nseal is formed by Ibura Mb. anhydrite). However, at the Mara field in Venezuela, a tight zone \n\nwithin the basement rock may act as the seal. At the other extreme is the situation in several \n\nCalifornia fields where a thick oil column extends from an oil-water interface within the \n\nbasement rock upward through a continuous reservoir, which includes such permeable material \n\nas wash and basal sandstone, until a tight rock is reached somewhere above the base of the \n\nsedimentary section, Landes et al (1960). \n\n \n\nMigration: As in any other reservoir, a migration path as to exist. As most basement rocks are \n\nhard and brittle with very low matrix permeability, the migration route occurs through higher \n\npermeability sedimentary units, active faults and the basement/sedimentary cover interface, into \n\nthe basement (Figure 5-1). There are three most common possible sources for oil accumulation in \n\nbasement reservoirs:  \n\n1. Overlying organic rock from which oil is expelled downward during compaction. \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 71 \n\n2. Lateral, off-the-basement, but topographically lower, organic rock. The oil is then squeezed \n\nfrom this rock, into an underlying carrier bed through which it migrates up dip into the \n\nbasement rock, or directly into the Basement \n\n3. Lower, lateral reservoirs from which earlier trapped oil is spilled due to tilting or overfilling. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nFigure 5-1: probable basement migration routes at the Rona Ridge, West of Shetland, and UKCS. Notice the \nlateral migration of the HC (signed by the red arrows) from the sedimentary sequence that unconformably \nlies over and at the sides of the Basement (Gutmanis, 2009; modified from Grant et al., 1999) \n\n \n\nReservoir: Reservoir space is also needed. In most basement rocks matrix porosity is close to \n\nzero, and reservoir quality depends on the development of secondary porosity, which in most \n\ncases is given by the fractures. The degree of reservoir space, i.e. fracture porosity, depends on \n\nthe mechanical properties of the host rock and on the applied stress over that rock.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 72 \n\n5.2 WORLDWIDE EXAMPLES OF FRACTURED BASEMENT RESERVOIRS \n\nThere are examples of Fractured Basement reservoirs all around the globe. Most reservoirs are \n\ngranitic, volcanic or gneissic; rocks with brittle behaviour which contributes for the formation of \n\nfractures. Below are some examples that this author considers important due to their similarity to \n\nthe SEAL Basin Fractured Basement, to their good production rates or operational procedures. It is \n\nimportant to highlight however that SEAL Basement rock is described as being a micashist, which, \n\nby its semi-ductile behaviour, is less prone to fracturing than brittle rocks. For a more complete \n\nlist of Fractured Basement reservoirs please refer to Gutmanis and Batchelor, 2005; from where \n\nthese examples were taken. \n\n \n\nChina \n\nYaerxia Oil Field: located in the Jiuxi Basin it was the first basement reservoir in China. The \n\nproduction comes from fractures in the Quannaogou Formation, a Paleozoic hard phylite, slate \n\nand meta-sandstone. The production from the wells ranged from around 70 bbl/day to 1050 \n\nbbl/day.  \n\nDong Sheng Pu Buried Hill Reservoir: it is a metamorphic basement rock which started to produce \n\nin 1983 with a production of aroud 1300 bbls/day. By December 1987, there were 14 active \n\nproducers and one observation well with cumulative volumes of oil and gas of around 7 MMbo \n\nand 2.3 Bcf respectively. With water injection, oil production rates varied between 7300 bbl/day \n\nand 11500 bbl/day which relates to an estimated cumulative oil production, at the end of the \n\nfield's production life, of 160 MMbo. \n\n \n\nGeorgia \n\nNinotsiminda Field: Located 25 km east of Tbilisi, and discovered in 1979, the Ninotsminda Field \n\nrepresents the largest remaining oil accumulation in Georgia. It is an anticlinal trap, with \n\nproduction mainly from the fractured Middle Eocene volcaniclastics. The reservoir is \n\nunderpressured at 0.38 psi/ft, and is dominated by sub-vertical micro and macro fractures that \n\nconcentrate mainly in the hinge area of the fold. \n\nIn 2000, a vertical well was drilled into the oil producing formation, with production tests \n\nstabilising at a flow of 200 bbl/day. In 2003 an appraisal horizontal well was drilled in 2003, this \n\nincreasing the production to 2200 bbl/day. The area is being extensively developed by the NOC \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 73 \n\n(Ninotsminda Oil Company), with a 5 well prospect likely to increase production from 2000 to \n\n4500 bbl/d (Durglishvili et al., 2004). \n\n \n\nLibya \n\nNafoora-Augila Field: this is one of the main giant fields in the Sirte Basin, and on of the primary \n\noil producing reservoirs is the basement granite. This reservoir is said to produce at rates that \n\nrange from 1200 bbl/day to 14,000 bbl/day.  \n\n \n\nHungary \n\nIn Hungary, hydrocarbon reservoirs within fractured and weathered zones of crystalline \n\nbasements are of great importance, as the majority of hydrocarbon reserves found in recent years \n\nhave come from this type of reservoirs. These metamorphic hydrocarbon-bearing formations are \n\ngenerally characterised by complex lithology, low porosity and a heterogeneous distribution of \n\npore sizes and fractures (Kiss &amp; T\u00f3th, 1985). \n\n \n\nThailand \n\nSirikit Oil Field: The Sirikit field lies in the Phitsanulok Basin, one of a series of Tertiary rift-related \n\nstructures in central and northern Thailand. About 14 wells had been drilled into the pre-Tertiary \n\nbasement  to 1995. Many had oil shows and two have been placed under production. The Field \n\nhas produced about 1.17 MMbo of oil from basement so far (November 1998).  Smitt, 1998, has \n\npresented a fracture simulation model using Frame and Poly3D sofwares to predict the fracture \n\npatterns in the basement. No information on how this impacted the reservoir production was \n\nfound. \n\n \n\nVenezuela \n\nMara Oil Field: lying Northeast of La Paz, Mara oil field used to be considered, the \u201cchampion\u201d of \n\nBasement producers (Landes, 1959). The complex basement is composed of metamorphic and \n\nigneous rocks, with hydrocarbon storage exclusively in fractures (Landes, 1959). By 1956, the \n\nMara field was producing from 29 wells in the basement reservoir at na average depth of 1,190 ft \n\n(363 m). Initial production was about 2,700 bbl/day but one well produced 17,000 bbl/day from \n\nthe basement (Landes et al, 1960). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

Cuu Long Basin is estimated to contain 30% of the country\u2019s hydrocarbon reserves, \n\nand presently it represents 95% of production, with 85% being produced from the fractured \n\nbasement (Figure 5-2).  \n\n \n\nBach Ho Field: Vietnam's most important offshore asset is the Bach Ho field which generated over \n\n50 MMbbo in 1996 (Anon, 1997). This field is at a depth of 5,000 m, of which 4,000 m is fractured \n\nbasement granite with a pay zone interval of 1,000 m (Russell, 1997). Production rates are listed \n\nat 202,000 bbl/day in September 2004 (see PES.GB, Jan. 2005). The volume in place has been \n\nrecently calculated at 1.59 billion barrels of oil, with around 95% of this amount contained within \n\nthe fractured basement. \n\n \n\nDai Hung Field: was discovered in 1988, and is now operated by Vietsovpetro following transfer of \n\nownership from BHP Billiton in 2000. The field contains significant accumulations of oil and gas in \n\na fractured granitic basement (up to 730 MMbo of oil), sourcing from lacustrine shales. Current \n\nproduction is 22.9 MMbo/day of gas and 1385 bbl/day of oil. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 5-2: (A) Location of \nCuu Long basin in offshore \nVietnam.

The primary drilling target was the fractured basement, \n\nwith secondary targets lying in the overlying sedimentary sequence. Current production of the \n\nEast Shabwa Development Area is 27,800 bbl/day, with around 30% of this figure being produced \n\nfrom the basement. \n\n \n\nDNO have also had significant successes in onshore Block 43. The  Nabrajah wells have primarily \n\ntargeted both the Qishn Formation sandstone and the Kohlan Formation dolomite, however \n\nsignificant hydrocarbons have also been discovered in the basement. Production tests carried out \n\nin the basement resulted in 5800 bbl/day of 38.6\u00ba API crude and 4162 Mscf/day of gas using an \n\nESP. Following a pressure build-up test, flow was 2812 bbl/day of 41.9\u00ba API crude, and 3054 \n\nMscf/day of gas with no pumping. Oil is also being produced from the basement in the \n\nneighbouring Blocks 10 and 14 (operated by TotalFinaElf and Nexen respectively) (see DNO press-\n\nrelease, 13/04/05).  \n\n \n\nOMV is operating Block 2, Block S2 and Block 29 in the onshore Yemen.

Block-B is cut by the south part of Carm\u00f3polis Oil field which \n\nproves the presence of this sedimentary unit in the area.  \n\n \n\nPresence of an effective migration path and sealing effectiveness: the presence of the Ibura Mb. \n\nin the seven drilled wells and the positive results of those wells \u2013 with HC presence in all of them \n\n\u2013 prove that there is an effective sealing capacity and that HC are migrating into the Basement \n\nrock.  \n\nReservoir space: the presence of open fractures, registered by the FMI, and the fact that the best \n\nresults from the seven wells were registered in the Basement rock \u2013 a micashist with very low to \n\ninexistent matrix porosity and permeability \u2013 proves that this rock possesses reservoir space. Even \n\nthough the fact that direct measurements of this reservoir space (porosity and permeability \n\nassessment) were not possible to make, quantifying it becomes an imprecise task.  \n\n \n\nIt is important to stress for future reference that this author considers that SEAL Basment \n\nFractured Reservoir should be classified as a Type 1 reservoir, as no evidence of matrix porosity \n\nwas found in the data acquired to the present.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

APPLICATION OF THE NFR WORKFLOW ON SEAL FRACTURED \n\nBASEMENT \n \n\n \n\nIn 2005 GALP acquired a set of exploration blocks located in Sergipe-Alagoas Basin \u2013 Sergipe Sub-\n\nBasin. What started to be a traditional exploration campaign, revealed the presence of a Naturally \n\nFractured Reservoir (NFR), and in particular a fractured metamorphic basement rock, when, after \n\ndrilling seven wells, the best results were registered in this formation. This Section is dedicated to \n\nthe analysis of the SEAL Fractured Basement Play, using the worlflow presented in the previous \n\nsection as a guideline. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.1 FRACTURE SYSTEM PROPERTIES \n\nAs shown in Section 4, identifying the fracture system can be done by using several sources of \n\ninformation: well data, outcrops, regional geology and seismic. These will then give information \n\non the properties that affect the reservoir performance and on the fracture system origin, which \n\nwill lead ultimately to the classification of the reservoir type \u2013 Figure 6-1. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(unfold next page) \n\n \nFigure 6-1: Initial part of the workflow dedicated to the identification of the Fracture System and to extract \ninformation about its properties from the available sources (Well Data, Outcrops, Regional Geology and \nSeismic). Seismic processing and Acquisition are not listed here, because in the present case Seismic was \navailable for use. As it will be seen ahead, the available seismic may not be the most adequate for the study \nof a NFR such as this, and acquisition and/or processing of new seismic should be considered. Volumes \ncalculation and Well design are also excluded as they are going to be considered individually in another \nsection. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 78 \n\n6.1.1 Outcrop Study \n\nDespite the fact that several outcrops are present in the area none was studied for the present \n\nwork.  \n\nBy its close geographical location relative to the areas of Block-A and Block-B, probably the \n\nItabaiana Dome (Section 2) would have been a good area to collect information on lithology of the \n\nhost rock and on fractures. As stated in the previous section, outcrop studies have to be \n\nconducted with care as most outcropping rocks will be altered by weathering, and probably more \n\nfractured than the same rock in burial conditions.

Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 79 \n\nBy the analysis of the local geological maps, using the information available in the literature about \n\nthe SEAL basement and the information from the wells (where lithology is described as phylite) \n\nthis author considers that the studied blocks are located over the Vaza Barris Domain \u2013 see Figure \n\n2-12. \n\n \n\n6.1.3 Seismic  \n\nThe work previously developed for this area had the objective of assessing the blocks\u2019 potential \n\nand recommend prospects to be drilled. As a result, the wells Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta \n\nwere drilled on Phase I and then, after an evaluation of their results, Phase II was conducted with \n\nEcho, Fox and Golf wells being drilled. For the present work the interpretation of Phase I will not \n\nbe described because Phase II re-interpretation replaced it and is considered to be more accurate. \n\nAt the same time all the analysis made over the seismic volume for this work was done using the \n\nPhase II re-interpretation.  \n\n \n\nInterpretation Workflow \n\nAn analysis of the existing interpretation (Phase I interpretation) was carried out to determine \n\nwhat needed to be re-interpreted. Apart from the problem of the horizons that had been picked \n\non the wrong seismic attributes it was also recognised that, after the drilling of Alpha, Bravo, \n\nCharlie, and in particular of Delta well, the top of Basement interpretation could be changed so \n\nthat in the structural lows, this formation could be deeper than previously thought, allowing the \n\ndeposition of Carm\u00f3polis sandstones in the paleo-valeys. The importance of this formation for \n\nthis play was described in Section 2. The current interpretation does not contemplate this \n\nformation as it is unclear as to what seismic reflector it is represented by. This is due to its low \n\nthickness which causes it to be below seismic resolution. Probably with better quality data, \n\nSpectral Decomposition would allow us to detect it.  \n\nAt this time, Basement was considered as the main objective, and as a result of this analysis and \n\nof time constraints, it was decided to re-interpret only the top of the Ibura Mb. and the top of \n\nBasement. At a later stage, the base of the Calumbi Fm. horizon was interpreted for depth \n\nconversion purposes only, with the objective of giving another control for the velocity model. \n\nHowever, this horizon has some interpretation problems, especially in the area of the Bravo well. \n\nThe faults were extensively reviewed. \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 80 \n\nInterpretation followed the regular workflow and it was undertaken in Seisworks?: faults were \n\ninterpreted initially followed by the horizon interpretation over the time volume. Inevitably, some \n\nfaults were reviewed or interpreted during the horizon interpretation. A Structure Cube (Figure 6-\n\n6) was created and used only as a guide for fault interpretation due to the low S/N ratio (Figure 6-\n\n3) of the seismic data which lead the interpretation to take longer than expected.  \n\nThe horizon interpretation started around the wells area, where a good well-tie was achieved and \n\nthen expanded to the whole area. The Auto-tracking mode was preferentially used relative to \n\nother tracking options, although this was always limited to reflector continuity. This interpretation \n\ntook longer than initially estimated mainly due to the poor quality data (Figure 6-4),  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6-3: (A) seismic line in Depth for Block SEAL-T-A (C) seismic line in Depth for Block SEAL-T-B. Notice \nthe bad seismic quality and the low S-N ratio.   \n\n \n\nTime-Depth Conversion \n\nThe depth conversion was carried out using the DepthTeam Express\n\u00ae\n application from Landmark, \n\nwhich allows the simultaneous use of seismic velocity cubes, well velocity functions, well picks, \n\nand corresponding time surfaces (Figure 6-5). The 3D seismic, horizons and faults were converted \n\nto depth, and maps were then created using the depth converted horizons. \n\n \n\nAttributes Extraction \nAs stated, the S/N ratio of the available seismic was very low. This conditioned the use of seismic \n\nattributes for detecting structural features such as faults and fractures. Even though, as part of \n\nthe previously recommend workflow, Coherence, Dip-Azimuth and Dip-Magnitude attributes \n\nwere run.

Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 85 \n\nAutomatic Fault Extraction Workflow \u2013 SEAL Basement Project  \n\nAutomatic fault extraction algorithms are proven to reduce interpretation times by as much as \n\nthree times (Silva, et al., 2005). For that reason, apart from the typical seismic interpretation, the \n\nFractured Basement Project developed new methodology for automatic fault detection in \n\ncomplex geological settings with low quality seismic data. This methodology was developed by \n\nthe Universidade de Aveiro, using the Ant Tracking algorithm existent in Petrel\u00ae software.  \n\n \n\nIn nature, ants find the shortest path between their nest and their food source by communicating \n\nusing pheromones, a chemical substance that attracts other ants. The shortest path will be \n\nmarked with more pheromones than the longest path and so the next ant is more likely to choose \n\nthe shortest route, and so on. Ant-Tracking uses this concept as an analogy for fault detection. \n\nThe idea is to distribute a large number of electronic \"ants\" in a seismic volume; and let each ant \n\nmove along what appears to be a fault surface while emitting \"pheromone.\" Ants deployed along \n\na fault should be able to trace the fault surface for some distance before being terminated. \n\nSurfaces meeting expectations will be strongly marked by \"pheromone.\" Surfaces unlikely to be \n\nfaults will be unmarked or weakly marked. The Ant Tracking algorithm creates a new fault \n\nattribute highlighting the corresponding fault-surface features having orientations within some \n\npre-determined settings. The algorithm automatically extracts the result as a set of fault-patches, \n\na highly detailed mapping of discontinuities (Ant-Tracking Manual \u2013 Petrel). \n\nThe Classical Ant Tracking workflow comprises three main stages: 1) seismic conditioning; 2) edge \n\ndetection; and 3) edge enhancement (the Ant Tracking cube itself). This standard workflow \n\nnormally achieves good results in areas of low geological complexity and when high quality and \n\nwell migrated seismic data is available, resulting in faults enhanced with a great level of detail. \n\nHowever, when the S/N ratio is low, such as in the present case, this workflow has some problems \n\nin detecting the discontinuities. For that reason a new methodology was created by Universidade \n\nde Aveiro (Figure 6-9) and the results were then used together with the data extracted from the \n\nFMI for the geomechanical modelling.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

Proposed seismic \nattributes are displayed inside boxes and seismic operations are in green (UNL, UALG, UA, &amp; IST; Modelling \nand Characterization of Fractured Reservoirs -GALP E&amp;P Internal Report; Lisbon; 2011). \n\n \n \n\nIn the new methodology proposed by the Universidade de Aveiro, a first derivative attribute was \n\nfirst calculated over the seismic volume cropped and trimmed by Top Basement horizon. This \n\nattribute acts as a high-pass filter where low frequencies are attenuated, high frequencies are \n\nenhanced and any zero-frequency component is suppressed (Figure 6-10). Then, structural \n\nsmoothing was computed over the first derivative seismic cube (Figure 6-11). This increased the \n\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the input seismic data, increasing seismic reflectors\u2019 continuity, while the \n\nlocal orientation (dip and azimuth) of the seismic reflectors were honoured, enhancing the \n\npresence of edges. Finally a variance attribute was calculated. Its calculation results in a new cube \n\nwith information only related with edges (discontinuities in the horizontal continuity of \n\namplitudes), such as faults and fractures (Figure 6-12). In complement to the variance attribute a \n\ndata volume with information corresponding to the local dip estimation of seismic reflectors was \n\nalso computed as part of the edge detection step. Local Dip Estimation may be useful to enhance \n\nthe presence of faults, and other discontinuities, as well as to distinguish between different \n\nseismic textures. In the presence of faults, estimated dip values change abruptly, while along the \n\nfault planes the estimated dip value remains barely constant (Figure 6-13) (UNL, UALG, UA, &amp; IST; \n\nModelling and Characterization of Fractured Reservoirs -GALP E&amp;P Internal Report; Lisbon; 2011). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

This interpretation process was independent from the automatic fault \ndetection workflow development and from the faults derived from the automatic fault extraction, in order \nnot to bias it. The faults were therefore interpreted exclusively on the original seismic data, using the \ntraditional user interpretation, and were considered as \u201chard data\u201d to validate the Ant Tracking proposed \nmethodology, without being influenced by its results (UNL, UALG, UA, &amp; IST; Modelling and \nCharacterization of Fractured Reservoirs -GALP E&amp;P Internal Report; Lisbon; 2011). The results are \npresented in Figure 6-15 and 6-16. In Block-A most of the faults interpreted by U.Aveiro team had been \nalready interpreted and received only some minor adjustments. Due to the better seismic quality and to \nmore available working time, more faults were interpreted in Block-B, and with better positioning relative \nto the seismic.

The oil shows found in Calumbi Fm. were not \n\nconsidered to be of importance due to the high content of shale in the sections where they were \n\nfound.

(-878m) to TD.  \n\n\u2022 Gas peaks were registered in Muribeca Fm. at 883/890m, 918m/920m and the most \n\nimportant at 957m/970m (Lower Ibura Fm., Top of Basement). \n\n\u2022 The Ibura Fm. did not contain as much anhydrite as expected, but the presence of \n\ncarbonates levels were confirmed. \n\n\u2022 The best oil shows were recorded at the base of the Ibura Fm. and Top Basement. \n\n\u2022 Oil shows were recorded in the Basement down to a depth of approximately 1040m. \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

The first cycle should have been performed as a clean up of the well, so that the \n\nactual pressure behaviour of the formations being tested could be registered on the second cycle. \n\nHowever, based on graphic analysis of the test result, it can be seen that reverse circulation \n\nstarted prior to Static Pressure Stabilization (SP). The pressure build-up period only lasted for two \n\nhours, time during which the formation pressure did not stabilize. Two observations can be made \n\nabout this: \n\n\u2022 The build-up time was very short, therefore making it difficult to make conclusive \n\nobservations on the reservoir permabilities. \n\n\u2022 It would appear that the interval\u2019s porosity is very tight and the pressure would have taken a \n\nextremely long time to recover based on the graphic rate of recovery. \n\nFFP \n\nSP  \n\nIFP \n\nIHP FHP \nPresure \n\n(PSI)\n\nIHP 1714,24\n\nIFP 228,38\n\nFFP 467,05\n\nSP 1398,96\n\nFHP 1755,81\n\nDST-02 \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

MDT tests were performed in these zones \n\n(Table 6-3). Wireline logs demonstrated that the intervals had good reservoir \n\ncharacteristics (Figure 6-26(B)), but were too thin to be considered for future production. \n\n\u2022 Some minor oil shows were found in the Riachuelo Fm. but these were considered \n\nirrelevant due to the high content of shale in the Formation. \n\n\u2022 Shows were also recorded from 884m to 1070m, in Muribeca Fm. and the Basement.  The \n\nbest were at the top of Ibura Mb. (Muribeca Fm.) and in the transition between this and \n\nthe Basement (Figure 6-27).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBravo Well   Alpha Well Depth \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

It would have been \nnecessary to open the valves for a second cycle to take conclusions on the real pressure behaviour of the \nwell. \n\n \n\nDST Results Analysis: Bravo Well \n\nThe DST procedures for this well were not performed according to the conventional procedures \n\n(outlined in the Appendix of this thesis), as only one cycle was undertaken (Figures 6-29 and 6-\n\n30). As a result it is difficult to make valid conclusions on the reservoir properties on the interval \n\nwhich was tested. The first cycle should have been done as a clean up of the well, so that the \n\nactual pressure behaviour of the formations being tested could be registered on the second cycle.  \n\n \n\nThe analysis of DST-01 graphic and the reported strong blow lead us to think that this is either an \n\ninterval with a relatively good permeability, or at high pressure, as a rapid increase in pressure \n\nduring the build-up period is observed. Taking into account that the Basement rock that was \n\ntested was identified in mudlogging as being a micaschist, we consider it to have very low or \n\ninexistent primary porosity. This lead us to think that it is not likely that the formation is at high \n\npressure but that the strong blow is a result of the good permeability given by the open fractures \n\nregistered by the FMI.

Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 116 \n\nApart from the Ibura Mb. where it is possible to identify two intervals of good porosity, the \n\nanalysis of the wireline logs indicate that no zones of interest are identified in either the \n\nOiteirinhos Member or Basement when utilising conventional attributes (Figure 6-34). It may also \n\nbe observed that two different sections can be identified in the Basement on the sonic log (Figure \n\n6-35): the average transit time in the upper section of the Basement (635m-650m) is higher than \n\nthe lower section. This may indicate that the upper section has lower cohesion \u2013 therefore \n\npotentially more fractured \u2013 than the lower Basement. This hypothesis is consistent with the fact \n\nthat the Basement was exposed prior to the sedimentation of Muribeca Fm. and this zone may be \n\na weathered/soil profile. This change in the sonic transit time also coincides with a shift in the \n\nneutron and density logs over the same interval. \n\n \n\nFor practical purposes, the mudlog and wireline log shown here display only the section from the \n\nMuribeca Fm. to TD (Figure 6-33).  \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

Given the \n\npresence of good oil shows over these intervals, and knowing the potential of fractured Basement \n\nfrom other locations in the region, and from our previous experience with Alpha, Bravo and \n\nCharlie Wells the decision was taken to run an FMI log and perform Drill Stem Testing (open hole).  \n\nAfter wireline logging it was considered that what had been interpreted by the mudlogger as the \n\nTop Basement during drilling, was in fact the Carmopolis Mb.

Therefore, this author believes that no Carmopolis Mb. was intersected in \n\nthe Delta well, and what is being interpreted is actually a disaggregated section of basement rock \n\ncaused by exposure to erosion in the past (Figure 6-44).\n\n          Charlie Well          Delta Well \n\nMuribeca Fm. \n\nDepth \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

The fact that during build-Up, the formation \n\npressure came close to stabilizing at around 285PSI below the FHP (Final Hydrostatic Pressure), \n\nand knowing that the mud density was 9,8 lb/gal, leads to the conclusion that this well may have \n\nbeen drilled highly overbalanced and that the registered blow is caused by the expulsion of the \n\nmud from the fractures. \n\n \nFigure 6-45: DST-02 pressure plot.

Given the presence of \n\ngood oil shows over these intervals, and knowing the potential of fractured Basement from other \n\nlocations in the region, and from our previous experience with Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta \n\nWells the decision was taken to run an FMI log and perform Drill Stem Testing (open hole).  \n\nTwo different sections that can be identified in the sonic log within the Basement (Figure 6-53): \n\nthe average transit time in the upper section of the Basement (971m-1030m) is higher than the \n\nrest, and these two sections are divided by a very visible spike in transit time at around 1030m. \n\nThe spike is also noticeable in the NPorosity and Density logs, and Resistivity also responds \n\ndifferently in the upper and lower section of the basement. This may indicate that the upper \n\nsection has a lower cohesion \u2013 more fractured \u2013 than the lower Basement. This hypothesis is \n\nconsistent with the fact that the Basement was exposed prior to the deposition of the Muribeca \n\nFm.

Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 160 \n\nConsiderations on Drilling and Testing Procedures \n\nTo date all the wells have been drilled vertically and in overbalance, with mud weights ranging \n\nfrom 8.7 lb/gal to 10 lb/gal. Considering that the main targets are Naturally Fractured Reservoirs, \n\nthis may not be the most efficient approach to drilling and evaluating these fractured reservoirs: \n\n- Vertical wells are not able to intersect most of the open fractures as these are not \n\nhorizontally distributed.  \n\n- Overbalanced drilling in a fractured reservoir will cause damage to the reservoir due to \n\nthe amount of mud invasion that can occur. This will have an influence on the way the \n\nreservoir behaves when, for example a DST is operated.  \n\nWell testing procedures were also erroneous, both in terms of the well sections tested and in the \n\nway the tests themselves were conducted: \n\n- The same sections should have been tested in different wells and independently; i.e. in \n\neach well Ibura Mb. and Basement should have been tested independently. \n\n- Every well should have been tested to TD with short to medium range DST\u2019s. \n\n- The DST\u2019s should have followed the standard procedure of two Flow-periods and two \n\nShut-in periods, so that conclusions on the reservoirs pressure behaviour could have been \n\ntaken. \n\n \n\nDue to these procedures, and to the fact that we do not have reliable pressure values for the \n\ntested intervals, it was not possible to take conclusions on the permeability of the Fractured \n\nBasement. \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 161 \n\n6.1.4.2 Image Logs Analysis \n\nTo make the visualization easier and because this is one of the most important sections of the \n\nwell analysis, the FMI logs that were run, will be analysed together for all wells. As all the wells \n\nwere made in the same geographic area it\u2019s not surprising that the features that were found are \n\nsimilar for all of them. These are: \n\n\u2022 Bed Boundary - these events are very common along the wells. They mark lithological \n\nchanges in the sedimentary record.  \n\n\u2022 Foliations: the events that were interpreted as foliations are very common particularly in \n\nthe Basement. Figure 6-72 and 6-73 show them in detail for Alpha Well, but they appear \n\nin all of the drilled wells. These can be misinterpreted as natural open fractures, which \n\nvery often occur parallel to the foliation due to decompression effect while drilling.  \n\n \nFigure 6-72: dynamic and static images from the Basement, showing foliation \u2013 purple tadpoles \u2013 dipping \naround 50\u00ba towards NE.

Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 163 \n\nFracture Aperture (fracture width): fracture aperture is calculated taking into account the \n\nmud resistivity, the rock resistivity and specific tool parameters. Fracture dip angle and \n\nextension are also an input, as well as the degree of aperture (partially or totally open). Luthi \n\nand Souhait\u00e9 (1990) describe the calculation algorithm:  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n W: fracture aperture \n b and c: specific tool parameters \n A: excess of current divided by the voltage integrated along a line perpendicular  \n to the fracture strike. \n Rm: mud resistivity \n Rxo: rock resistivity \n \n\nConsidering that Rm and Rxo have influence on the calculation of the aperture, they should \n\nbe as precise as possible. In general, if Rm is too high, it tends to increase the calculated \n\naperture, and vice-versa. An high Rxo will diminish the aperture and vice-versa. Two types of \n\nfractures can be calculated: mean aperture and hydraulic. For porosity calculation it is the \n\nhydraulic aperture that is used. \n\n \n\nFracture porosity: fracture porosity for this purpose is defined by the percentage of wellbore \n\nwall that is covered by the fracture. The calculation of this property uses the parameters \n\nfracture density and the area of wellbore that is covered by the image log. It is important to \n\nhighlight that only the fracture porosity is being calculated here as there is no contribution of \n\nprimary porosity. Literature shows that fracture porosity doesn\u2019t normally go beyond 1.5% - \n\n2% (Nelson, 1985). \n\n \n\nFracture aperture and fracture porosity values are presented in Table 6-10 \n\n \n\nInduced Fractures: these are generated during drilling operations, and are related to the \n\nsubsurface stresses. Their strike is in general parallel to the largest stress, and when associated \n\nwith breakouts (well deformation in a preferential direction) they help characterizing the principal \n\ntensors in the region (Figure 6-75). \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

This means that the most accurate measurements are those \n\nof fractures which inclination is closer to horizontal (See Section 4), case of family B1 and E. From \n\nthis comes that, if family A is dipping at 60\u00ba and still is the most common, it is probably the \n\npredominant fracture direction in the area, and the one that future drilling campaigns should be \n\naiming to intersect.  \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 174 \n\n6.2 FRACTURE SYSTEM ORIGIN \n\nThe literature for SEAL Basin structural evolution describes the Basement as part of a complex \n\nfold belt, created by the collision of two cratonic masses \u2013 Section 1. For this reason, and because \n\nthere was no data suggesting another origin, this was the premise used for the fracture system \n\norigin of the Basement.  \n\nIn tectonic related systems, fractures are formed by the application of surface forces and form in \n\nnetworks with specific spatial relationships to folds and faults, and generally are widespread \n\nacross the Basin. In this case, and due to the mapped structures it was decided to study the SEAL \n\nBasement fracture system in light of these principles. This means that the location of the study \n\narea is not important as wherever it is, the fracture system will be generically be equal. By making \n\nthis assumption it was possible to use geomechanical modelling to derive fracture density and \n\norientation, as it will be demonstrated in the following section (Universidade do Algarve \u2013 UALG \n\nwork). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n6.3 FRACTURE PROPERTIES AFFECTING RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE \n\nThe four petrophysical determinations most useful in this evaluation are: fracture permeability; \n\nfracture porosity; fluid saturations within the fractures and the recovery factor expected from the \n\nfracture system. These properties are directly dependant on three fracture properties:  \n\n\u2022 fracture morphology,  \n\n\u2022 fracture spacing, \n\n\u2022 fracture width and permeability. \n\nFor determining these, core analysis, well tests and image logs are the best methods. As \n\npreviously stated, cores were not available at the time this study was carried, leaving us with well \n\ntests and image logs to try to obtain the properties that affect reservoir performance.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 175 \n\n6.3.1 Fracture Morphology \n\nDefining the fracture morphology only from FMI data is a very imprecise task. It is only possible to \n\ndetect if fractures are open, partially open or healed (amongst other physical characteristics), but \n\nnot their physical shape. In order learn on the fractures morphology (which can influence the \n\npermeability of the reservoir \u2013 See Section 4.2.3.1), extracting full diameter cores would have \n\nbeen essential. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.3.2 Fracture Spacing and Permeability \n\nAs evaluation of outcrops and cores (the most reliable source to determine fracture density) was \n\nnot available, FMI data and faults mapped by seismic interpretation was used in the context of \n\nthe Fractured Basement Project, (for further reading please refer to: Modelling and \n\ncharacterization of fractured reservoirs, blocks SEAL-T-A and SEAL-T-B Project Report \u2013 May \n\n2011).   \n\n \n\n6.3.2.1 Geomechanical Modelling  \n\nDespite being observed in borehole data (FMI Logs), fractures could not be detected in seismic \u2013 \n\ndue to small their small size (which causes them to be sub-seismic), and to the poor seismic \n\nquality. For this reason these discontinuities could not be detected in the rock volume between \n\nthe wells. The aim of the geomechanical modelling was to simulate the density and orientation of \n\nthe fractures on that space. The following description is based on the final report of the Fractured \n\nBasement Project (Modelling and characterization of fractured reservoirs, blocks SEAL-T-A and \n\nSEAL-T-B Project Report \u2013 May 2011), more specifically on the UALG\u2019s team work. Describing and \n\nexplaining in detail the geomechanical modelling done for the SEAL area is outside the scope of \n\nthis thesis, for that reason, only the input data and the results will be presented. For more detail \n\nplease refer to the mentioned work.  \n\nInitial Assumptions \n\nIn any tectonic setting, the regional stress field is perturbed by local factors, of which mechanical \n\ndiscontinuities such as faults are the most important. The modelling used on this project assumed \n\nthat the distribution of the small-scale discontinuities (the fractures) was determined by: \n\na) the superposition the regional tectonic stress  \n\n(b) the local perturbation of that stress state resulting from the nearby larger faults \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 176 \n\n \n\nThe larger mapped faults (faults interpreted by the U.Aveiro Ant-Tracking Workflow presented in \n\nsection 6.1.3) were considered pre-existing structures and input for the model, and the predicted \n\nfractures were assumed to form later as the result of the interaction between those faults and the \n\nregional tectonic field.  Coulomb failure criterion (Jaeger and Cook, 1979) was used to estimate \n\nthe fault strike: \n\n \n\nWhere is the angle of the failure planes to the maximum principal compressive stress (  ), and \n\nis the coefficient of internal friction. The theory predicts that two conjugate failure planes \n\nintersect along the principal intermediate stress  (Figure 6-83), and the fault orientation is \n\ninfluenced only by and the orientation of the principal stresses. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nFigure 6-83: According to Anderson\u2019s theory of faulting, the \nprincipal stresses are vertical and horizontal. The most \nfavourable fault planes intersect along the intermediate \nprincipal direction and make an angle with the maximum \nprincipal compressive stress and are equally probable (UNL, \nUALG, UA, &amp; IST; Modelling and Characterization of Fractured \nReservoirs -GALP E&amp;P Internal Report; Lisbon; 2011). \n\n \n\n \n\nAssuming that the faulting regime is determined by Anderson\u2019s theory of faulting, the optimally \n\noriented conjugate shear fractures are the most likely planes to be formed on the vicinity of \n\nfaults, and maximum Coulomb shear stress (MCSS) can be used to infer their densit (UALG, 2011): \n\n \n\nWhere,?1>?2>?3. \n \n\nThe development of the modelling carried out by UALG involved the following steps: \n\n\u2022  Build the 3D model geometry after recognition of the basic structural scenario; \n\n\u2022  Specify material properties; \n\n\u2022 Impose remote loading and local boundary conditions; \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

The UALG team explains this by theoretical models of \n\nfaulting but these theoretical predictions can also be proven by real examples. One example is the \n\nNatih Field, Oman where the chalky limestones are heavily fractured. The use of high-quality 3D \n\ndata sets, allowed the detection of flexures and faults with throws as small as 3m. Overlaying the \n\nfracture orientation data from core and FMI on a seismic dip map (Figure 6-87a) allowed \n\nestablishing a relation between fractures and faults. By doing this the operator was able to revise \n\nthe well-targeting strategy and placed wells near small faults and flexures. These wells had an \n\naverage improvement of 30% in gross productivity, indicating that these wells are intersecting \n\nmore open fractures than before (Figure 6-87 b) (Whyte, S.; unknown date).   \n\nThe same association between fracturing and faulting was observed in FMI images from \n\nhorizontal wells in Idd El Shargi Field, offshore Qatar.

This was done in two steps: \n\nI) Characterize the relationship between fracture number (N), fracture area (P32) and linear \n\nfracture density (LFD index) per fracture family.  \n\n \n\nII) Generation of histograms of equivalent permeability using the Oda method, conditioned \n\nto the LFD index, fracture family and reservoir block. \n\n \n\n\u201cTo simulate 3D fracture networks that allow the calculation of histograms of permeability it is \n\nnecessary to characterize the relationship between the LFD (measured at wells with FMI data, \n\nSection 6.4.2), number of fractures (N) and fracture areas (P32) per fracture family. This means, \n\nfor a specific 3D reservoir block, estimate the number of fractures by family and correspondent \n\ndistribution of areas (P32) that match a specific LFD at vertical direction, the same direction \n\nevaluated by FMI.\u201d - Modelling and characterization of fractured reservoirs, blocks SEAL-T-A and \n\nSEAL-T-B Project Report \u2013 May 2011. \n\nThe problem that the UNL team faced to achieve this was that fracture orientation is not \n\nconstant, which mean s that the relationship between LFD, fracture number (N) and area (P32) is \n\nunknown. To solve this problem, an inverse approach was used through the application of the \n\nFTRIAN software created by UNL, an algorithm of fracture simulation that allows the generation \n\nof equally probable fracture network scenarios within a volume constraint by a LFD index \n\n(Almeida, Barbosa, 2008) (Figure 6-89). Fracture networks are simulated using a polygonal \n\napproximation. In the present case squares were used, but triangles can also be used (Figure 6-\n\n90): the software first generates random locations with Monte Carlo (each random location is the \n\ngeometric centre of a fracture), and then for each creates a vector allowing the positioning of the \n\nfirst square vertex; successive rotations of the vector (four rotations of 90\u00ba) generates a square. \n\nAfter each cycle, the model is then sampled with scan-lines (simulating a well).  In the present \n\nstudy, it was considered enough generating three realizations for each evaluation and sampling \n\nthe model with 1000 vertical scan-lines. After several iterations, look up tables relating N, P32 and \n\nLFD can be built.  \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

Nevertheless, the same methodology was \n\nused for treating the data from the five wells, meaning that any possible error will affect that data \n\nthe same way, hence allowing for a fair comparison between them.  \n\nIn terms of the presented results it can be seen that the permeability values are very high (they \n\nare actually overestimated as Wf used equals 1mm, when it is usually around 0.1-0.01mm) and \n\nporosity is very low, which is a typical characteristic of a fractured reservoir.

Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 195 \n\nFinally it is important to mention that unless long term well tests or laboratory core tests had \n\nbeen done to properly estimate permeability, this approach is probably the most complete and \n\naccurate that can be done by using only FMI data. \n\n \n\n \n\nConsiderations on the Fracture System \n\nAs it was already mentioned, the absence of core or outcrop data makes that any consideration \n\nabout the fracture system will have the same level of uncertainty. At the same time the fact that \n\nthe wells have been drilled vertically leads to an underestimation of the fracture families\u2019 density. \n\nEven though, and considering what was observed in the previous section, from the 3 fracture \n\nfamilies present, Family A is the best candidate to be intersected with a well, as it is the family \n\nthat presents the best density, permeability and porosity indexes (Figures 2 and 3; Table 7). \n\nRelative to the fracture-matrix interaction, it was also already stated that this is a Type 1 reservoir \n\n(p. 76), which means that only fractures provide the essential permeability, and the rock matrix \n\nshould not be considered in the models.  \n\n \n\nThe next section is dedicated to the Technical Recommendations for future work on Block-A and \n\nBlock \u2013B area, which should be seen as the main a conclusion of the present thesis.  \n\n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS  \n\nThe final objective of this exercise is to provide GALP a well location which, relative to the seven \n\nwells drilled previously, assures better production rates. In order to establish a successful well \n\nlocation, i.e. a location which has higher chances of becoming a discovery well, the geologist must \n\ncollect the most information he can on the area where he is placing that well location. This \n\nchapter is dedicated to provide a series of technical recommendations, based on what was \n\npresented in the previous sections, and that in the author\u2019s opinion will lead to an improvement \n\nof the exploration and production results in the Basement of the SEAL Basin.  \n\n \n\nThis section is divided into two parts: the first will be dedicated to the data that should be \n\nacquired for better understanding of the fracture system; and the second to the actual definition \n\nof a well location and the associated volumes \u2013 which have not been previously calculated for this \n\narea.

Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 197 \n\n7.1 TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DATA PROCESSING AND \n\nACQUISITION \n \n\n7.1.2 Seismic Processing of the existing data  \n\nEven though post-stack migration is much faster than pre-stack migration (because stacking \n\nreduces the number of traces that must be processed) and it is cheaper, pre-stack migration gives \n\na better imaging quality and is the most efficient type of migration when geological structures are \n\ncomplex (Section 4.2.7). This is the case of SEAL, where the Basement rocks have undergone high \n\ndeformation presenting complex structures and, most importantly for HC production, fractures. \n\nRe-processing the already available seismic with pre-stack techniques, giving more attention to \n\nthe picking of the initial stacking velocities particularly at Basement depth, would probably \n\nproduce better imaging, hence allowing for better definition of the fracture patterns, which in its \n\nturn allow for better planning of drilling campaigns.  \n\nIt is strongly recommended that this technique is applied before a new seismic acquisition \n\ncampaign is considered as it represents a relatively low cost and it can largely improve the way \n\nthe Basement is evaluated.  \n\n \n\n \n\n7.1.1 Seismic Acquisition of new data \u2013 Narrow VS Wide Azimuth  \n\nIn the SEAL Basin, the use of Wide-Azimuth seismic, despite the fact that it would definitely \n\nimprove seismic imaging and hence the way that the fracture system is understood, is determined \n\nby the volume of HC that can be proven to exist in the Basement reservoir. Calculating volumes \n\nfor this reservoir is a very difficult task and has a high degree of uncertainty. As a result of this \n\nWide-Azimuth seismic acquisition may be an operation harder to justify to the management, \n\ngiven its extra acquisition expense. Even though, the small area to be covered by the acquisition \n\n(Block-A and Block-B totalize an area of around 60 Km\n2\n) may represent a small cost increase \n\nrelative to the gain in seismic quality and hence in the understanding of the fractures system. As \n\nsuch, acquiring Wide-Azimuth seismic should be an option to consider.  \n\nIf the option of Wide-Azimuth seismic acquisition is not taken, is still possible to improve the \n\nseismic image quality by applying different methods of processing than those that have been used \n\nto process the 3D seismic that was used for this work.  \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 198 \n\n7.2 TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DRILLING CAMPAIGNS \n\n \n\nThe well location is supported by the following: \n\n \n\n\u2022 Results of the seven wells drilled previously. The current wells did not produce well during \n\ntesting. All seven found HC, demonstrating that the area has good potential, and that \n\nthese poor results in testing might be due to erroneous drilling procedures (vertical wells, \n\noverbalance, improperly executed DST\u2019s). At the same time, it is not expected that \n\nmaintaining these procedures will lead to different results. The proposed well will use \n\ndifferent methodologies to try to overcome these problems. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Data Acquired in the wells. The FMI data acquired, shows that there are several fracture \n\nfamilies present in the Basement. From these, Family A (Section 6, Table 6-11) is  the most \n\npromising due to its predominance. The proposed well will be projected in a way so that \n\nthe contact of the well with the fractures is maximized \u2013 a directional well, intersecting \n\nfracture planes perpendicularly. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Geomechanical + DFN Modelling: predicted the fracture density, permeability and \n\nporosity of the several fracture families, data that will be used ahead for volumetric \n\ncalculations. It also helps supporting the idea that in every Basement high, HC will be \n\nfound because these fractures are distributed throughout the entire Basement.  \n\n \n\n\u2022  Worldwide Analogues. Similar situations for fractured basement are found everywhere \n\naround the globe. In these analogues the exploration techniques used are substantially \n\ndifferent from the ones used in SEAL by GALP (Section 5), namely directional and \n\nunderbalanced drilling.  \n\n \n\n\u2022 Volume Calculations: In order to justify any well location, the calculation of the Oil-in-\n\nPlace is essential. Without a proper and reliable assessment it is not possible to evaluate \n\nwhich techniques are economically sustainable or even if drilling a well is justifiable. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 199 \n\n7.2.1 Volumes Calculations for SEAL Fractured Basement Reservoir \n\nIn order to justify any well location, the calculation of the Hydrocarbons Initially In Place is \n\nessential. Without a proper and reliable assessment it is not possible to evaluate which \n\ntechniques are economically sustainable or even if drilling a well is justifiable. The following \n\ncalculations are based on Figure 7-2 map. Notice that the Hydrocarbons Initially In Place are going \n\nto be assessed for the sum of the three fracture families defined previously.  \n\n \n\n \n\n(unfold next page) \n\n \n\nFigure 7-2: Top Basement depth map, for Block-A and Block-B showing the interpreted faults and the well \nlocations.

The wells displayed were not defined in this map as they were drilled prior to its \n\nconstruction. Map created using Petrosys\n?\n\n. \n\n \n\n \n\nVolumetrics can be assessed by using the Oil in Place formula, HIIP (Hydrocarbons Initially In \n\nPlace):  \n\n \n\nHIIP = GRV x NTG x Phi (?) x Shc x FVF \n\n \n\nWhere: \n\nGRV: gross rock volume.  \n\nNTG: Net-to-gross \n\nPhi (?): porosity \n\nShc: Hydrocarbon saturation \n\nFVF: formation volume factor. \n\n \n\nFor the present case study, it was decided to use this formula by changing the way each of the \n\nvariables is calculated. Below is a description of the workflow used to calculate the HIIP for the \n\nSEAL Basement. Notice that for the reservoir characteristics that Naturally Fractured Reservoirs \n\npresent, it is difficult to place a reasonable certainty on volumetric estimates of original HIIP, \n\nrecoveries and hence reserves. As a consequence, the following volumetric calculations should be \n\nplaced in the possible category.  \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

This can be assessed in two \n\ndifferent ways:  \n\n \n\n1.  Area/Depth graphs confined by the spill point* (which may or may not be deeper than the \n\nOWC contact). \n\n2. Geostatistical simulation. \n\n \n\nBoth methods require the mapping of the prospect and the identification of the uncertainties \n\nwhich are usually large, depending on the type of opportunity under evaluation (structure, OWC \n\ntype).  Commonly, the GRV is assessed by the first method in the following logic: \n\n \n\nGRV = Area of closure x Thickness \n\n \n\nThe Area of Closure is assessed by measuring the areas enclosed by successive contours until the \n\ndeepest closing contour of the structure. These areas are then plotted against the thickness \n\n(depth) of the reservoir, which is confined by the spill point (Figure 7-3).  Two options have been \n\ntested: \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7-3: definition of the structure, and area of closure for the GRV calculation. Here the last closing \ncontour is at -9500 ft.

Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 201 \n\n1. Assessing GRV per Basement High: To quickly evaluate the validity of calculating the GRV \u2013 and \n\nconsequently the volumes \u2013 for each single Basement structure, it was decided to make the \n\ncalculation for the Basement high where the well with best results was located.  That was the \n\nBravo and Fox structure (Section 6). For this, the 1060m contour (depth to which HC were found)  \n\nwas used. The map can be seen in Figure 7-4 and the GRV calculations for this structure can be \n\nfound in Table 7-1. It can be seen that structure and consequently the HIIP that would have been \n\ncalculated using this method would have been very small and economically not sustainable as the \n\ntotal area of the structure is less then 1km\n2\n. \n\n \n\n2. Assessing the GRV for the total Area of Basement above a certain depth: In Figure 7-2 it is \n\npossible to observe that Basement highs are structurally narrow which causes them to have small \n\nareas. It is possible that, as they are very close to each other they could be interconnected \n\nstructures. In Figure 7-5 and 7-6 the red contour shows the maximum depth to which HC was \n\nfound in GALP wells (1060m). It was considered to use it for GRV calculations, but the fact that in \n\nwell BR-01 (a well from the database drilled in 1981), oil shows below 1200m depth, within the \n\nBasement, were found suggests that open fractures can be found at this depth.  At the same time \n\nthe fact that HC were found in all the wells, makes reasonable to assume that every basement \n\nhigh was charged and consequently there are HC stored in the open fractures of those basement \n\nhighs. These observations lead this author to consider that a common lowest closing contour can \n\nbe chosen for calculation purposes, making the final GRV much higher. Table 7-2 shows the GRV \n\nvalues when the 1200m base contour is chosen for Block-A, and Table 7-3 for Block-B. \n\n \n\nAfter identifying the structure and calculating the GRV, it is necessary to identify the reservoir \n\nrocks by log analysis, calculate porosities on those intervals and to calculate the hydrocarbon \n\nsaturation of those same intervals. It is necessary to calculate the Net-To-Gross (NTG), Porosity \n\n(?) and Saturation (Sh). \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

It is derived \n\nfrom petrophysical evaluation of well data allied with play analysis for lithological variation that \n\ncan modify the NTG (Figure 7-7). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 7-7: example of table generated by Schlumberger IP software that shows the results of the \npetrophysicist interpretation. Of the B interval, 89.7% is considered to be reservoir \u2013 which means that NTG \nis 0.897 - while C is 100% reservoir. \n\n \n\nIn a Basement Naturally Fractured Reservoir, where matrix porosity is close to zero, or non-\n\nexistent, all the storage space is in the fractures. Consequently, the net-to-gross calculation \n\ncorresponds to an assessment of the percentage of rock volume that is occupied by fractures, \n\nwhich is the same as calculating the fracture density.  \n\nIn the case of SEAL Fractured Basement, fracture density was assessed using data from the FMI \n\nand data from the DFN modelling (Table 6-20 reproduced below). This way it is possible to obtain \n\nthe theoretical fracture density per family. Here we can read the number of fractures that need to \n\nbe simulated to reach the linear density found in the wells. Notice that these values have been \n\ncalculated using FMI density data, which is underestimated as the wells have been drilled vertical \n\nand fractures are sub-vertical.  \n\nIn order to obtain the percentage of rock volume that corresponds to fractures, these were \n\nsimulated by UNL team (in squares or triangles) using FTRIAN software in a 100 x 100 x 5 \n\nreference block, until the density that was observed in the wells per family was reached (Section \n\n6.6.2.2) As the fractures are simple polygons, the area was calculated by FTRIAN software for each \n\npolygon using a polynomial law. \n\n \n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

In a regular clastic or carbonate rock, porosity is assessed by \n\ncalculating the voids that exist in the volume of rock that was considered to be reservoir, i.e. the \n\nNTG. Using the example of Figure 7-7, in unit B, the NTG is 89.7%, and porosity is 8,2%. This \n\nmeans that of those 89.7% of rock that is considered reservoir, only 8.2% is pore space.  \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 211 \n\nIn a Basement rock, where there is no reservoir space apart from that given by the fractures, \n\nwhen NTG is calculated (in the present case it was calculated by DFN simulation), it is already \n\naccounting for the pore space that would be given by porosity, because what is being calculated is \n\nthe total volume of rock that is occupied by open fractures, i.e. the volume of space that exists \n\nbetween fracture walls \u2013 or fracture porosity. Hence, for volume calculation purposes two \n\nalternatives can be used: \n\n \n\n1. Assess NTG and use ? = 1. \n\n2. Assess porosity (methods on how calculate fracture porosity are described ahead) and use \n\nNTG=1, using the same logic described above.  \n\n \n\nFor obtaining fracture porosity, the following methods can be used: \n\n \n\n1. Using the empirical formula:  \n\n \n\nPhi = 0.001 x Wf x Df x KF1 \n\n \n\nWhere: Wf= fracture aperture (millimetres); Df= fracture frequency (fractures/meter); KF= \nnumber of main fracture directions (1, 2, 3\u2026) \n\n \n\nUsing data from the FMI measurements we can calculate the porosity for the three fracture \n\nfamilies using Wf= 0.001-0.6 mm; Df= 2.6 + 1.6 + 1 (maximum observed density in wells for each \n\nfamily); KF=3 because we are calculating values for the three families. Table 7-6 shows the \n\nporosity values calculated for the three fracture families observed in the wells. The same values \n\nwill be used for Blocks A and B. \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 7-6: Range of porosities using the empirical formula Phi = 0.001 x Wf xDf x KF1, and data from the FMI \nreadings. \n\n \n\nMinimumm Maximum\n\nAperture (mm) 0,01 0,6\n\nPorosity (%) 0,0156 0,936\n\nFracture \n\nFamily\nInputs\n\nBlock A+B\n\nA+B1+B2\n\n \n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

Bulk fracture porosity values of between \n\n0.1 and 1% are typical for fractured reservoirs including basement (Nelson 2001, Narr et al 2000; \n\nGutmanis, GeoSciense Ltd, 2010); hence, for volume calculation, a range of fracture porosity \n\nbetween a minimum of 0.1%  and a maximum of 1% and will be used. \n\n \n\nNotice that assuming that there is no matrix porosity is considered to be a valid approach because \n\nwe are dealing with a micashist, and even if there was porosity, it would be so low that it would \n\nbe insignificant in terms of storage capacity of the reservoir. \n\n \n\nShc: Hydrocarbon Saturation is the average ratio of the pore volume occupied by hydrocarbons \n\nbefore hydrocarbon production. Water saturation is usually calculated first because of its direct \n\nderivation mainly from the petrophysical evaluation of well data. \n\n \n\n Shc = 1- Sw Where Sw is the water saturation - the average ratio of pore volume in a \n\n   rock that is occupied by formation water.  \n\n \n\nFrom the well logs presented in Section 6, determining water saturation is not possible, because \n\naccurate resistivity measurements to input in Archie\u2019s equation, for Sw derivation are not possible \n\nto make. This way, and because we are calculating volumes for the HC bearing zone of the \n\nbasement (given by the GRV) we assume that the fractures are saturated with hydrocarbons. \n\nHence Shc= 100%. \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

As the gas bubbles out of the oil, the volume of the oil \n\ndecreases. Stabilized oil under surface conditions (either 60\u00ba F and 14.7 psi or 15\u00ba C and 101.325 \n\nkPa) is called stock tank oil.  \n\nOil reserves are calculated in terms of stock tank oil volumes rather than reservoir oil volumes. \n\nThe ratio of stock tank volume to oil volume under reservoir conditions is called the Formation \n\nVolume Factor (FVF). It usually varies from 1.0 to 1.7. A formation volume factor of 1.4 is \n\ncharacteristic of high-shrinkage oil and 1.2 of low-shrinkage oil, and it should be calculated. FVF \n\nvalues are dependant on the hydrocarbon composition and depth (initial pressure) of the \n\nreservoir.  \n\nFor the SEAL Basin, FVF was calculated by using HC properties such as the API gravity, formation \n\ntemperature and pressure data (taken from the DST\u2019s at Basement depth). As Gas-Oil-Ratio (GOR) \n\nwas not available, a series of plausible values were used, excluding the results which returned \n\nbubble point pressure values higher than the formation pressure. The results suggest that a range \n\nof FVF between a minimum of 1.07 (m\n3\n/Sm\n\n3\n) and a maximum of 1.23 (m\n\n3\n/Sm\n\n3\n) with a mode value \n\nof 1.14 (m\n3\n/Sm\n\n3\n) can be used in a Stretched Beta distribution. \n\n \n\nHC Water Contact: In the SEAL Basement, establishing the HCWC is a difficult task. As it can be \n\nseen from Section 6 the depth to where HC was found varies from well to well. The fact that DST\u2019s \n\nhave not been undertaken in a consistent manner, and the presence of a well with positive results \n\nin a structurally lower position than GALP wells,  does not help to determine where the OWC \n\nshould be placed. Two situations were considered (Figure 7-8):  \n\n \n\nHCWC determined by field wide communication: If a fracture extends below the HCWC, it can \n\ncontain both water and HC, but if the fracture system is in pressure communication, which is \n\ncommon, it is expected to encounter a linear HCWC that reflects that pressure communication \n\nand does not let water rise above a certain depth. \n\nHCWC determined by fracture extension: in the case of a Basement reservoir, matrix porosity is \n\nnull, and hence only fractures can contain HC or water. This causes the HCWC to be defined \n\naccordingly to the open fractures extension, which is not linear, and consequently it will be an \n\nirregular limit.  \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 214 \n\n \n\nAs the HCWC value had to be considered and there was no available data on a field wide fracture \n\ncommunication, it was decided to assume that this contact was irregular and determined by the \n\nfracture extension. HCWC was confined to the spill point, which was decided to position at the \n\nlowest contour, above which HC were found (1200m, as it can be seen in Figure 7-2, BR-01 well). \n\nAs the deepest oil found (confirmed by DST testing) was at 1402m depth \u2013 Bravo and Golf wells \u2013 \n\nit was decided to use a uniform distribution between 1042 m and 1200m. \n\n \n\nOWC determined by \n\nfield wide \n\ncommunication\n\nOWC determined by \n\nfracture extension\n\nOWC determined by \n\nfield wide \n\ncommunication\n\nOWC determined by \n\nfracture extension\n\n \n\n \nFigure 7-8: Difference between the expected OWC in a regular reservoir and the OWC in a Basement NFR. \nNotice that it is not linear, as some fractures may extend below the oil column and contain water.

Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 217 \n\nThe following considerations can be made relative to the results presented in Table 7-8 and \n\nFigures 7-9 and 7-10: \n\n\u2022 Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 output similar volumes. Notice that both scenarios use FMI data \n\n(fracture aperture and maximum observed density in wells) to calculate NTG (Scenario 1) or \n\nPorosity (Scenario 2). The difference between them is the methodology: \n\nIn Scenario 1, an inverse approach was used and NTG was assessed by simulating fractures \n\nwith a determined area so that the linear density value of 2.6 could be reached, and then it \n\nwas calculated what was the correspondent fracture density \u2013 the NTG \u2013 was calculated. \n\nIn Scenario 2, a well known and empirical formula uses values of aperture and density \n\ntogether with a multiplication factor that corresponds to the number of families found, to \n\ncalculate porosity.  \n\nThe fact that  NTG values from Scenario 1 and Porosity values from Scenario 2 are of the same \n\norder of magnitude, supports the logic used for volumes calculations described above (see page \n\n210), and explains why STOOIIP values are similar.  \n\n \n\n\u2022 Scenario 3 shows very low values of STOOIIP. This method utilises data derived from modelling \n\nand can be seen as either highly pessimistic or realistic. Pessimistic due to the possibility of the \n\nexistence of a series of compounding errors caused by the various inputs used to create the \n\nmodels. The low porosity, however may be a realistic estimation of fracture porosity within a \n\nnon-brittle rock (such as this mica-schist) compared to the analogue data which represents \n\nmore brittle fractured reservoirs \u2013 Scenario 4.    \n\n \n\n\u2022 As expected, Scenario 4 shows the largest values of STOOIIP as fracture porosity used was taken \n\nfrom literature on Fractured Basement Reservoirs. Most of these consist of brittle rocks such as \n\ngranites, gneisses or basalts, rheological characteristic that causes the rock to be more prone to \n\nfracturing and hence fracture density and fracture apertures to be larger. This, in its turn \n\ninfluences the storage capacity of the rock - more volumes of HC are capable of being stored in \n\nbrittle rocks. Scenario 4 can be seen as the comparison term for the other three scenarios, as all \n\nparameters except porosity are the same. Notice that Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 have STOOIP \n\nvalues which are close \u2013 but lower \u2013 than STOOIP outputted from this Scenario 4. This \n\ndifference can be explained by lithological differences: SEAL Basement rocks are michashits \n\nwhich are less brittle than those rocks used as a model in Scenario 4 and consequently will have \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 218 \n\nlower fracture density and porosity which will account for lower volumes of stored \n\nhydrocarbons. \n\n \n\nIn sum, all the four simulated scenarios are relatively inaccurate, which is supported by the large \n\nvariation of STOOIIP, ranging from 60 MMBo (Scenario 4 \u2013 Block-B) to 0.38 MMBo (Scenario 3 \u2013 \n\nBlock A). Nevertheless, it was decided to consider Scenario 1 and 2 as the most acceptable. Notice \n\nthat both are based on direct observations using the FMI tool (aperture and density), meaning \n\nthat there are no errors related to modelling assumptions, and at the same time STOOIIP is \n\nprobably higher than what has been calculated, as measurements from FMI tool are \n\nunderestimated due to the relation between vertical well and sub-vertical fractures as stated \n\npreviously. \n\n \n\nConsidering this, and the recoverable factor that was decided to use (10%-20%) it\u2019s expected \n\naround 4.5 to 7.8 MMBo to be recovered. Even though these values can be largely increased \n\ndepending on the production methods used, and hence this estimation should not be considered \n\nas definitive as it can change along the field development cycle.  \n\n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 219 \n\n7.2.2 Directional and Underbalanced Drilling \n\nAs it was mentioned in Section 4.2.8.1, drilling directional wells at an angle from vertical in a \n\ndirection normal to fracture planes and parallel to the minimum in situ stress, where most \n\nfractures can be intersected, is the recommend strategy by most authors (Nelson, 2001; Aguilera, \n\n1995, Ehlig, 2000). Using an analogy with horizontal wells it\u2019s useful to demonstrate how this \n\nstrategy is standard use in the industry. \n\nHorizontal drilling was not a popular technique before the 1990\u2019s. Oil companies only drilled \n\nhorizontal wells in difficult situations as a \u201clast resort\u201d. Analysing a graphic of the global total for \n\n1989 it is easy to verify that only 200 horizontal wells had been drilled. In 1990 that total \n\nincreased to almost 1200 wells, with nearly 1000 of these drilled in the USA (Figure 7-11). What \n\nwas then the factor that determined this dramatic change? \n\n \n\nFigure 7-11: After great success in the USA in 1989, the global number of horizontal wells increased \ndramatically (www.slb.com \u2013 Horizontal Highlights). \n\n \n\nIt was the great success obtained in the Austin Chalk play in Texas, which transformed horizontal \n\ndrilling into a mainstream technique. Activity in this formation soared from just 10 horizontal \n\nwells in 1989 to more than 200 in 1990.  \n\nThe efficiency of this method relative to vertical wells is demonstrated by several examples:  \n\n \n\n1.

The \n\ndifference in production rates between a directional well and a vertical well spans from around \n\n3700 bbl/day to 530 bbl/day, respectively. \n\n \n\n3. In Georgia\u2019s Ninotsiminda Field, a vertical well was drilled in 2000 into the oil producing \n\nformation, with production tests stabilising at a flow of 200 bbl/day. In 2003 an appraisal \n\nhorizontal well was drilled increasing the production to 2200 bbl/day. \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 221 \n\nThese successful examples from different parts of the world prove that horizontal/directional \n\ndrilling is a valid technique that can be used in very different geological settings. This author \n\nconsiders that in SEAL the execution of a directional well, instead of the traditional vertical wells, \n\nwould lead to better results, i.e. higher production rates, by increasing the contact area of the \n\nwell with the fractures. Adding to this, the well should be planned in a way so that it is drilled near \n\na fault, particularly at a fault tip, as it was explained in Section 5.6.2.1. \n\n \n\nAs stated previously Family A is the fracture family which should be intersected with this well. \n\nTwo reasons support this option: \n\n \n\n- Higher Density: FMI well data show that Family A is the most frequent fracture family to be \n\nfound with 104 measurements of open fractures inside the Basement. This is supported by DFN \n\nmodels.  \n\n \n\n- Higher Permeability and Porosity: Permeability models based on DFN and Geomechanical \n\nmodelling show that Family A is by far the fracture family with higher permeability and porosity \n\nvalues.  \n\n \n\nAccording to Family A average fracture orientation taken from the FMI readings (Table 6-11), \n\nobtaining a well orientation which is perpendicular to it is straightforward (Figure 7-13) This well \n\nshould have a 30\u00ba inclination and should be drilled in the direction of the 240\u00ba azimuth in order to \n\nperpendicularly intersect the N22\u00baW/60\u00baNE Family A fractures. With this orientation it is expected \n\nthat the well (which is called Hotel following the same alphabetic logic used previously) presents \n\nbetter results than the seven wells drilled previously, as it is intersecting the open fractures which \n\nare predominant in the Basement rock.

Hotel is simulated directional and \ndirectional+underbalanced, both for a maximum inclination of 30\u00ba and an average build-up-rate (BUR) of \n3\u00ba/30m.  Notice that the extra cost in order to drill in underbalanced conditions relative to a directional well \nis close to $70.000 and that the total cost of the well is of $2.9M, which is around $590K more than a \nregular vertical well.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nFrom this simulation, it can be observed that the extra cost in order to drill in underbalanced \n\nconditions relative to a directional well is close to $70.000 and that the total cost of the well is of \n\n$2.9M, which is around $590K more than a regular vertical well (relative to Fox). Hence, a \n\ndirectional well would have a 22% cost increase and a directional plus underbalanced well an \n\nincrease of 25%.

FINAL CONSIDERATIONS \n \n\n \nThe final considerations to sum the analysis of the SEAL Fractured Basement Reservoir can be \n\ndivided in three general topics:  \n\n \n\n1. Considerations on the fracture system that affects the Basement \n\n2. Considerations on the adopted workflow and on the achieved results. \n\n3. Considerations for future work. \n\n \n\n1. Considerations on the fracture system that affects the Basement \n\nFrom the analysis of the references in the literature, seismic, well data (FMI and DST data), it was \n\npossible to conclude that the Basement rock in the area of Block-A and Block-B is highly fractured.  \n\nStatistical analysis of the FMI measurements allowed the identification of several fracture \n\nfamilies, of which one \u2013 Family A \u2013 was considered to be the most common as it was found in all \n\nseven wells.  \n\nConjugating FMI data with seismic and by applying geomechanical principles, and DFN modelling, \n\nit was possible to simulate how fractures are distributed in the basement rock and as a final \n\nproduct  generate comparative simulated permeability and porosity graphics. These showed that \n\nfracture Family A is the one which presents the highest values of both permeability and porosity.  \n\n \n\n2. Considerations on the adopted workflow and on the achieved results \n\nThe fact that only indirect data (FMI, DST and seismic data) were used to create permeability \n\nmodels for the fractured Basement, lends some inaccuracy to these models, as fracture densities \n\nand apertures are underestimated due to the relation vertical-well VS sub-vertical fractures. Even \n\nthough, and considering that the objective was to define a fracture family that could be \n\nintersected with a directional well, i.e. a comparison between the properties of the several \n\nfracture familes, the objective was totally achieved. If the permeability and porosity values are \n\nnot accurate, the error will be in the underestimation direction which allows saying that better \n\nresults than those that were predicted are expected.   \n\n \n\n3. Considerations for future work. \n\nWhen dealing with Naturally Fractured Reservoirs, it is imperative to define a fracture family \n\nwhich presents the higher permeability index so that drilling campaigns can be planned \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 226 \n\naccordingly, in order to achieve higher production rates. This thesis proved that Family A is the \n\nbest candidate, and a directional well with 30\u00ba inclination drilled in the direction of the 240\u00ba \n\nazimuth should be drilled as an alternative to the vertical wells. At the same time, and because \n\nfractured reservoirs are a system sensitive to high pressures, an underbalanced well was \n\nproposed.   \n\n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 228 \n\nA. Cores \n\nCores represent the most important direct source of information for fractured rock analaysis.  \n\nThey are used to determine reservoir quality and performance by summing together the \n\nindividual small-scale elements of the reservoir that can be \u201cread\u201d on the core. Most authors \n\nrecommend that, on the first exploratory wells, the fractured reservoir section should be cored. \n\nTwo types of cores can be taken: side-wall cores and whole-core samples. Whole-core samples \n\nare useful in fracture evaluation for two reasons: \n\n \n\n1. They sample a relatively large volume of rock and consequently potentially sample more \n\nregularly-spaced reservoir fractures than side-wall cores; \n\n \n\n2. Standard permeability analyses can be performed in three dimensions on these samples \n\n(vertical, maximum horizontal and horizontal 90 degrees to maximum horizontal \n\npermeability).  \n\n \n\nPermeability analysis, allows the calculation of the absolute permeability of a fracture (or fracture \n\nsystem) at surface conditions and the simulation of the permeability anisotropy that fractures \n\ncause. In addition, correlative fractured and unfractured plugs taken from the whole-core samples \n\ncan be subjected to tests done in confining pressure or under a variety of mixed loading \n\nconditions that simulate burial conditions, with the objective of measuring the variation in \n\nfracture and matrix properties. Determinations of fracture permeability under confining pressure \n\nare very important because open fractures are generally higher in absolute permeability than the \n\nmatrix, but also much more compressible and, therefore, reduce in permeability and porosity \n\nfaster than the matrix with the application of force (Jones, 1975; Nelson and Handin, 1977; and \n\nNelson, 1981b).  \n\n \n\nSome general procedures that should be used in coring fractured formations are: \n\n1. Use a core barrel liner of either plastic or aluminium. It helps keep the core intact and \n\nprevents jamming.  \n\n2. Most fractured rocks are usually the hardest most brittle rocks; hence there is a tendency \n\nto weight up on the bit to maintain penetration rate. However if weight on the string is \n\ntoo high, extension fractures in front of the coring bit might be generated. These are then \n\ncaptured in the core as \u201ccenterline fractures.\u201d They will also show up in the borehole wall \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 229 \n\non image logs (FMI, etc.), and get in the way of interpreting the real fractures. This way it \n\nis important that the driller doesn\u2019t put to much weight on the bit, and that this weight is \n\nas constant as possible throughout the coring.   \n\n3. Special handling of the core is often needed. If we are interested in natural fractures, \n\nremoving the core from the barrel with a sledge hammer is not a good idea. \n\n4. Care should also be taken during twist-off at the bottom of the core. Aggressive twist-off \n\nin breaking the core off bottom may generate helical induced fractures in the bottom of \n\nthe core. \n\n5. Coring fractured rocks should be done as continuously as possible. The longer the core, \n\nthe larger recovery rates obtained. \n\n6. In some hard rocks, some workers add the Hugel Knives to the mouth of the core barrel. \n\nThese knives create the orienting scribes on the core when taking an oriented core. The \n\nidea is that the knives keep the fractured core from spinning as it enters the barrel and, \n\ntherefore, prevents jamming. \n\n7. Drillers should not trip too fast, as this often causes problems and damage the core. \n\n \n\nA complete analysis of a core should include at least the following evaluations (Aguilera, 1993):  \n\n\u2022 Fracture types description \n\n\u2022 Grain density \n\n\u2022 Petrophysical parameters \u201cm\u201d (cementation exponent) and \u201cn\u201d (saturation exponent) \n\n\u2022 Whole core porosity and permeability (at room conditions and some samples at simulated net \n\noverburden pressure) \n\n\u2022 Routine core analysis \n\n\u2022 Capillary pressures and relative permeabilities \n\n\u2022 Wettability determination in a preserved core \n\n\u2022 Imbibition recoveries if the rock proves to be water wet \n\n\u2022 Mechanical testing (Poisson\u2019s ratio, Young\u2019 modulus, stress strain analysis, matrix and fracture \n\ncompressibility) \n\n\u2022 Thin section analysis \n\n\u2022 SEM (scanning electron microscopy) analysis \n\n\u2022 Epoxy impregnation \n\n\u2022 Spectrometric gamma ray and sonic velocity \n\n\u2022 Solubility \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 231 \n\nB. Drill Stem Tests \n\nDrill Stem Test (DST) is a procedure for isolating and testing the surrounding geological formation \n\nthrough the drill pipe. Generally DST\u2019s main objectives are (Trilobite Testing Inc. Manual):  \n\n\u2022 To assess the well potential  and hence its commerciality \n\n\u2022 To evaluate well damage \n\n\u2022 To evaluate the reservoir pressure and permeability and to characterize the reservoir \n\nheterogeneities \n\n\u2022 To estimate a connected volume  \n\n\u2022 To obtain samples of the reservoir fluid, for PVT, flow assurance and process studies. \n\n \n\nThese tests are usually conducted with a downhole shut-in tool that allows the well to be opened \n\nand closed at the bottom of the hole with a surface-actuated valve (Figure B-1). One or more \n\npressure gauges are mounted into the DST tool and are read and interpreted after the test is \n\ncompleted. The tool includes a surface-actuated packer that can isolate the formation from the \n\nannulus between the drillstring and the borehole wall, thereby forcing any produced fluids to \n\nenter only the drillstring. By closing in the well at the bottom, afterflow is minimized and analysis \n\nis simplified, especially for formations with low flow rates. The drillstring is sometimes filled with \n\nan inert gas, usually nitrogen, for these tests. In low-permeability formations or where the \n\nproduction is mostly water and the formation pressure is too low to lift water to the surface, \n\nsurface production may never be observed. In these cases, the volume of fluids produced into the \n\ndrillstring is calculated and an analysis can be made without obtaining surface production. \n\nOccasionally, operators may wish to avoid surface production entirely for safety or environmental \n\nreasons, and produce only that amount that can be contained in the drillstring. This is \n\naccomplished by closing the surface valve when the bottom-hole valve is opened. These tests are \n\ncalled closed-chamber tests.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 233 \n\nDrillstem tests are typically performed on exploration wells, and are often the key to determining \n\nwhether a well has found a commercial hydrocarbon reservoir. The formation often is not cased \n\nprior to these tests, and the contents of the reservoir are frequently unknown at this point, \n\ntherefore obtaining fluid samples is usually a major consideration. \n\nThe typical DST will be split into four periods, pre-flow, initial shut-in period, main-flow period and \n\na final shut-in period (Figure B-3). Times for each test are dependent on conditions at the well \n\nsite. DST\u2019s can be run at any time during the drilling operation at the current depth, or may be \n\nused to test any interval in the hole after TD has been reached. Using these data, and based on \n\nthe evaluation of engineers and geologists, management can base a decision to complete the hole \n\nfor potential production of oil or gas or proceed with abandonment.  \n\n \n\nInitial Flow Period: is a production period to clean up the well, and is used to remove any \n\nsupercharge given to the formation due to mud infiltrating into the prospective formation during \n\nthe drilling operation. \n\nInitial Shut-In Period: this period allows the formation to recover from pressure surges caused \n\nduring pre-flow. Is often referred to as \u201cclosed in for the pressure build up\u201d and is a longer period. \n\nIt allows determining the initial reservoir pressure.  \n\nMain Flow Period: a more lengthy production period designed to test the formation flow \n\ncharacteristics more rigorously. Flowing pressures and temperatures will be recorded. During this \n\nperiod surface blow is also recorded and interpreted.  \n\n \n\nSurface Blow Interpretation (Figure B-2): surface blow action is caused by the entry of fluid or \n\ngas into the empty drill string. As the fluid or gas enters the empty drill string (through the \n\ntest tool) the air is displaced out of the top of the drill string. This results in a blow of air at the \n\nsurface that can be measured. The procedure normally used is to place one end of the bubble \n\nhose into a 5 gallon bucket of water. The \u201cBLOW\u201d description is based on the level of bubbling \n\naction in the bucket of water. \n\n \n\nWeak blow at surface indicates slow entry of recovery into the drillstem. This can be caused \n\nby several things: \n\na. Tight zone-low permeability \n\nb. Plugged anchor or tool \n\nc. Highly damaged test zone \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

DST guidebook \n\n \n\nFinal Shut-In: formation pressure is recorded over this period. The shape of the pressure build up \n\ncurve will tell us the permeability of the formation, the degree of formation damage (likely caused \n\nduring drilling operation).  \n\n \n\nAs said, the drill stem testing technique, the well is controlled by a down hole shut in valve.  \n\nBefore the test, the well is usually partially filled with a liquid cushion designed to apply a \n\nhydrostatic pressure \u201cB\u201d above the valve, smaller than the formation pressure \u201cE\u201d. When the \n\ntester valve is opened, an instantaneous drop of pressure is transmitted to the formation, and \n\nfluids from the formation start to flow into the well, it\u2019s the Initial-Flow Period (\u201cC\u201d to \u201cD\u201d). In \n\ncase of liquid flow, the level rises in the production string and the backpressure due to the liquid \n\ncolumn increases. The well is then shut-in for a pressure build-up (\u201cD\u201d to \u201cE\u201d) \u2013 Initial Shut-In \n\nPeriod. When no flow to surface is desired, the down-hole valve is closed before the liquid level \n\nhas reached the surface. If surface production is possible, the flow time is extended until the well \n\nproduces at surface and the rate tends to stabilize. The DST procedure then becomes similar to \n\nthat of a standard production test.  \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 235 \n\nThe well is then opened for the test and, due to the backpressure of the rising liquid column, the \n\nbottom-hole pressure increases (\u201cF\u201d to \u201cG\u201d). Finally, the well is shut-in for a final build up period \n\n(\u201cG\u201d to \u201cH\u201d). The \u201cI\u201d point is the final hydrostatic pressure. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure B-3: standard graphic for a typical Drill Stem Test.

The hydrostatic mud \n\nweight, water loss properties of the mud, and the chemical-osmotic potentials between \n\nthe mud and formation determine the amount of filtrate that enters the formation.  \n\n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

Invasion of solids: solids invasion occurs when a zone has high permeability and a large \n\npressure differential between hydrostatic and formation pressure. Drilling mud can be \n\npacked into the wellbore. The solids may be immobile when testing owing to the \n\nviscosities and pore geometries. \n\n \n\n3. Mechanical damage: Mechanical damage is induced by the rotary drilling procedure. \n\nOften fine particles, created by the grinding of rock chips, are forced into the wellbore. \n\n \n\nWellbore damage DST\u2019s exhibit a weak blow at the surface and very little recovery (Figure B-5). \n\nPressure charts indicate low flowing pressures and a sharp pressure rise after the tool is shut-in. A \n\nshort radius pressure transition during build up followed by a flat pressure increase is also \n\ncharacteristic of a damaged wellbore.

Borehole Images (Formation Micro Imager ) \n\n \n\nBorehole images are electronic pictures of the rocks and fluids that are found when a wellbore is \n\ndrilled. Such images are made by electrical, acoustic or video devices which are lowered into the \n\nwell. Images are oriented, have vertical and lateral resolution, and provide critical information \n\nsuch as bedding dip, fractures, faults, unconformities, paleocurrent directions, vuggy and fracture \n\nporosity. These images are best used when in conjunction with other available wellbore data such \n\nas other logs, cuttings, cores and production data. For the present purpose, only electrical \n\nborehole images are of importance. \n\n \n\nElectrical borehole images are based on dipmeter technology that has been commercially \n\navailable since the 1950s (Bigelow, 1985, Gilbreath, 1987) (Figure C-1).

Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm \n\n 243 \n\nLogging Routine \n\nThe modern imaging tools have microresistivity electrodes arranged around the tool on pads that \n\nare pressed against the borehole wall. The tool is first introduced in the well with the pads closed. \n\nAt the start of each run, four, six or eight pads are pressed against the wall. The number of pads \n\ndepends on the logging device which is being used (different companies, use different tools \u2013 \n\nFigures C-2 and C-3). \n\nElectrical current is forced into the rock through the electrodes, and remote sensors measure the \n\ncurrent after it interacts with the formation (Figure C-4 and C-5). Data retrieved include multiple \n\nelectrode readings, calliper readings from individual pads or pairs of paids, and x-, y- and z-axis \n\naccelerometer and magnetometer readings. Borehole deviation and tool orientation (relative to \n\npad 1) are determined by the magnetometers. \n\nThe sample rate for electrode and accelerometer data is very high (around 400 samples/), and thr \n\nareal coverage of the borehole face is a function of the width of the electrode arrays, number of \n\npads, and borehole diameter. Generally, 40 to 80% of the borehole face is imaged, appearing the \n\nunimaged parts of as blank strips between the pads. The depth of investigation is small, usually \n\nless than 2,5 cm into the formation. Logging rate is comparable to other logs, being around \n\n550m/h.  \n\n \n\nFigure C-2: Example of an e electric logging tool. \n\n \n\n\n\nUniversidade de Aveiro \u2022 GALP E&amp;P \n\nS.

As it is very difficult to examine borehole \n\nimages in 3-D, it is common to \u201ccut\u201d the borehole along true north, and then unroll the cylinder \n\nuntil it becomes a 2D view.
