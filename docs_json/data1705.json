Oil and gas production in deep and ultra deep water require the development of new production techniques, such as novel artificial elevation techniques. Currently, Petrobras is developing a new subsea pump module, equipped with an electrical submersible pump (ESP), known as MOBO applied to a multiphase mixture flow (oil, gas and/or water). The MOBO system architecture creates suitable flow conditions to assure pump operational continuity. This study simulated the pump flow behavior through computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Two MOBO geometries were built - with and without side holes in a shroud pipe that encases the ESP intake - to simulate an internal two-phase (water and air) flow. For numerical results validation, a comparison with previously acquired experimental results in the Petrobras Research Center (Cenpes), was performed and showed good agreement. The shroud pipe, strategically equipped with side holes, was able to expressively attenuate the phase discontinuities in the ESP intake region. This minimized gas discharge events and the associated lack of pump operational continuity. Numerical simulations with oil and gas, exhibiting similar characteristics to those found in the Campos Basin, also showed an absence of gas discharges within the tested conditions - by similarity laws corresponding to 3.034m3.d-1 of oil with 10% or 40% of free gas.\nkeywords: \u25a0 oil flow \u25a0 pump module \u25a0 submerged centrifugal pump \u25a0 computational fluid dynamics\nResumo\nUm dos grandes desafios na produ\u00e7\u00e3o de petr\u00f3leo de reservas offshore \u00e9 a garantia da economicidade ao longo da concess\u00e3o explotat\u00f3ria do campo.

In Brazil, approximately 86.3% of oil production and more than 69% of gas production come from offshore accumulations, with the majority located in deep water (300 to 1.500m deep) and ultra deep water (deeper than 1.500m) (Petrobras, 2010).\nRecent offshore oil and gas field discoveries, such as the giant Tupi and Jupiter fields, among other pre-salt accumula\ntions, have increased the offshore petroleum resources in ultra deep water depths. These have consequently led to an increase in the use of floating systems to explore, produce and maintain wells and subsea equipment. The Study of Technical and Economical Feasibility (STEF) associated with operational and financial risk analyses, identify the attractiveness of the exploitation investment portfolio. However, the uncertainties associated with the accumulations themselves and/or the production process evolution may jeopardize the potential gains calculated in the prospecting phase. Thus, oil and gas production in deep and ultra deepwater scenarios necessarily involves the development of various production techniques, inclu\nding the artificial lift and flow techniques of the produced fluids to the processing facility. These artificial lift and flow techniques have a strong influence on the production planning and field development, ensuring ultimately, economical flow rates against the typically very high investment in oil and gas offshore production. Among these artificial lift techniques, the Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP), deployed in a production and/or dummy well, offers a very powerful performance.\nThe ESP artificial lift method was first established in the beginning of the last century and more recently, thanks to Petrobras and a few other technology driven oil companies, is now widely used in offshore subsea scenarios. In principle it uses an electrically driven centrifugal pump, to raise the mixture of fluids produced by the reservoir. The pump increases the available reservoir energy sufficiently to carry the mixture to a platform or a pre-processing unit. This pump has multiple stages and under conventional subsea usage - similar to onshore usage - is a downhole installation in the host production well. The ESP is powered by an electric motor through a coupling with protective seals. An electric cable supplies the energy, typically running from the mother surface platform to the downhole well motor.\nEach stage of the ESP is composed of a fixed diffuser and a rotating impeller. According to Estevam (2002), the geometrical dimensions of each stage, such as the rotor diameter and height, are important factors affecting the pumped fluid flow and lift height. Parameters such as the pump suction pressure, the pumped fluid properties, the rotor geometry and the gas flow presence (two phase flow) influence the pump performance and dictate its developed characteristic curve. For a given flow, the pumped fluid characteristics, the number of pump stages and the speed define the total lift height (specific energy) and consequently the operational power required.\nSubsea pumping\nPetrobras pioneered world subsea ESP usage by installing the first ESP in a subsea wet completion well (RJS-221, Ca-rapeba Field, 1994) followed by a similar application in deep water (RJS-477, Albacora Field, 1998). Since then, the number of Petrobras new facilities has been minimal. Other operators have used this concept more widely. However recent discoveries in deep and ultra deep water off the Brazilian co\nast and the need to produce marginal areas has re-instated the alternative ESP artificial lift, applied to wet completion wells, as a strategic option for oil production.\nAccording to Rodrigues et al. (2005), no matter the success of pioneer applications, in Petrobras and elsewhere, the typical MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) achieved bench mark has always brought concerns whenever an ESP is deployed down hole in a production well. In 2001, Petrobras began studying an alternative to avoid installing ESPs within the production wells. The main motivation being, when a down hole installed ESP fails in a subsea wet completion well, the only possible intervention is with a workover rig qualified for offshore deep and ultra-deep water. The cost of this intervention is very high and furthermore, there is the cost of production interruption - typically 20 to 25 days for a full repair action. Besides this is all the intrinsic and associated risk to the well production continuity following such intrusive intervention.\nUnlike the ESP the gas lift method, particularly due to its simplicity and intrinsic robustness, is considered a high reliable method, always offering outstanding operational continuity. It should be noted that, for offshore production, the gas lift application is fully justified as a good alternative to the technical-economic scenarios of wells near the production units, with low concentration of water and/or not too heavy oil. However, in long horizontal production flowline distances, the presence of gas injected into the production tubing contributes significantly to the frictional losses that occur. In addition, if emulsions form when considerable water cuts are present the gas lift effectiveness is further reduced and ESP based methods tend to be more attractive compared to gas lift.\nThe ESP based methods when compared to Gas Lift methods even with dissimilar operational flexibility levels, intrinsic robustness, ultimate high levels of operational availability levels and demanding higher installation - capital (Capex) and operational expenditure (OPEX) ESP costs may still be attractive due to the potential higher flow rates. However, accepting an ESP failure brings associated very high costs - a combination of repair and loss of production values - some contingencies are typically considered and usually provided. Among those can be found a gas lift redundant, an ESP redundant or an ESP being deployed out of the production well (i.e., on a adjacent dummy well directly on the sea bed). Fi\ngure 1 presents some results associated with typical gas lift or ESP usage. It should be noted; no matter how low the pump thermodynamic efficiency - due to the smaller suction pressure levels and associated free gas levels - the facility to intervene and maintain the well productivity under another redundant artificial lift method (typically based on gas lift) exhibits a synergic and very attractive combination.\nPetrobras in testing concepts and developing new subsea pumping equipment has also worked with some subsea equipment companies to design and build a prototype called a pumping module. This is equipped with an ESP to be installed in a dummy well near an offshore Brazilian production well in water depths of 1.400m. The major objective of the prototype and associated work is to test a new alternative. The results will support the selection of technologies employed in the future field development phases in the current Petrobras portfolio. The prototype is designed to work with a 30m ESP The dummy well is located typically about 200m from the production well.\nExperimental tests of pumping module model\nAn experiment was performed at the Petrobras Research Center (Cenpes) to identify the flow behavior inside the\npumping module (MOBO) using an acrylic apparatus built for the tests. The MOBO is a large pipe - similar to a well surface casing size - capped at both ends and fed from the top cap with the produced flow stream (oil, gas and water) from the host production well near the MOBO located dummy well. Inside the MOBO is another pipe -acting as a column tubing, in which an ESP is located with its intake in the column tubing. Surrounding the column tubing is a, capped-top shroud pipe with lateral drilled holes that are strategically located in terms of location, population and sizes. The main objective of the pumping module is to assure a proper multiphase flow mixture, particularly in terms of free gas, for the best ESP operation.\nThe mock test and associated campaign was based on a study of similarity laws, which was then tested to visualize the flow dynamics inside the pumping module, particularly related to the shroud pipe modifications (without and with 15 x 1.0mm side hole) and with different inlet flows of water and gas. According to Gaspari et al. (2007), experimental studies were performed on a reduced scale (7.5:1) prototype model. The geometrical and hydrodynamic similarities have been respected in this model apparatus construction, which is schematically represented in figure 2.\nFigure 1 - Figure 1 - ESP versus Gas Lift -Riser of 1500 m, Flowline of 6 inches and ESP Motor of 1200 hp (Rodrigues, 2005).\nFigura 1 - ESP versus Eleva\u00e7\u00e3o por G\u00e1s - Tubo de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de 1.500m, Tubo de escoamento de 6 polegadas e Motor de ESP de 1.200cv (Rodrigues, 2005).\nFigura 1 - ESP vs Elevaci\u00f3n por Gas -Tubo de producci\u00f3n de 1.500m, Tubo de flujo de 6 pulgadas y motor de ESP de 1.200cv (Rodrigues, 2005).\nFigure 2 - Experimental apparatus of a dummy well pumping module.\nFigura 2 - Aparelho experimental de um m\u00f3dulo de bombeamento em um po\u00e7o alojador.\nFigura 2 - Aparato experimental de un m\u00f3dulo de bombeo en un pozo falso.\nExperimental results - shroud with and without side holes\nThis article selected a case from each group of tests performed by Gaspari etal. (2007) in the apparatus containing the shroud with and without side holes. It should be noted in all Gaspari et al. (2007) experiments, the main objective was to visualize the internal flow dynamics. In the first selected cases the shroud without side holes was used and, with the MOBO intake percentage of gas (PG) of 7.0% for an associated water\nflow rate of 9.02L/min (table 1). The second case represents the results for the shroud with holes and, the MOBO intake percentage of gas (PG) 8.0% for an associated water flow rate of 9.02L/min (table 2).\nWhere:\n100* Air Flow Rate at Entrance of the MOBO\nPG=------------------------------------------------- (1)\n(Air Flow Rate at Entrance of the MOBO +\nWater Flow Rate at Entrance of the MOBO)\nPG (%)\tWater Flow Rate (L/min)\tAir Flow Rate at Flowmeter (L/min)\tPressure at Flowmeter - P2 (kgf/cm2)\tPressure at the Entrance of MOBO - P3 (kgf/cm2)\tPressure at Outlet of MOBO (kgf/cm2)\n7.0\t9.02\t0.84\t0.9\t0.6\t0.1\nExperimental observations: (1) a few very brief discharges from annular dummy well/shroud; (2) Dynamic Level in dummy well/shroud annulus region ranged from 4.1 to 4.2m measured from MOBO entrance.\nTable 1 - Experimental data - Shroud without side holes,\tTabela 1 - Dados experimentais - Shroud sem orif\u00edcios\nPG of 7.0% and water flow rate of 9.02L/min.\tlaterais, PG de 7,0% e taxa de fluxo de \u00e1gua 9.02L/min.\nTabla 1 - Datos experimentales - Shroud sin orificios latera-les, 7,0\u00b0% PG y la tasa de flujo de agua 9.02L/min.\nPG (%)\tWater Flow Rate (L/min)\tAir Flow Rate at Flowmeter (L/min)\tPressure at Flowmeter - P2 (kgf/cm2)\tPressure at the Entrance of MOBO - P3 (kgf/cm2)\tPressure at Outlet of MOBO (kgf/cm2)\n8.0\t9.02\t0.78\t0.7\t0.3\t0.1\nExperimental observations: (1) No discharges from annular dummy well/shroud; (2) Dynamic Level in the dummy well/shroud annulus region was established at 1.3 meters from the MOBO entrance.

This study was conducted with water flow \"through\" the computational model (fig. 3).\nThe computational mesh was selected in a computational model exhibiting the same geometry as the experimental apparatus. Then the CFX-Pre-Module was defined thus modeling the flow of two fluids (water and air) subject to the operational conditions presented in tables 1 and 2. This was done to simulate and analyze the MOBO flow dynamics. This analysis also allowed a direct comparison between the numerical computational results and the Gaspari et al. (2007) collected data.\nIn addition to a three dimensional view of the fluid flow dynamics inside the MOBO, the CFD simulation allowed us to equip the apparatus with particular monitoring - among tho\nse, the average pressure at the MOBO intake (P_Entrada), at the shroud base (P_Shroud) and the percentage of free gas profile in the region representing the suction of the electrical submersible pump (PG-Intake1 and PG-Intake2) and also within the MOBO (PG-MOBO). As a general boundary condition for each simulation, the MOBO domain was considered as initially filled with water.\nSimulation results - shroud without side holes - MOBO with PG 7.0% and 9.02L/min of water\nThe results obtained with the Simulation Pumping Module containing the shroud without side holes showed good agreement when compared with the experimental results. In addition, it has also highlighted that even considering a biphasic current, with bubbles dispersed in the MOBO intake, the geometry of the equipment attached to the initial down flow direction of fluid and interactive properties of the water/air led to the segregation of the phases (gas/li-quid) into the MOBO (see internal and external views of the MOBO in figure 4).\nANSY5\nAnular externo\n(revestimento - Shroud) modelo MOBO\nAnular interno (coluna de produ\u00e7\u00e3o -Shroud) do modelo MOBO\nFuros de interliga\u00e7\u00e3o anular externo -anular interno do modelo MOBO\nIntake da BCSS do modelo MOBO\nY\nX\nANSYS\nSa\u00edda do modelo MOBO\nEntrada do modelo MOBO\nFigura 3 - Malha computacional - Detalhes.\nFigura 3 - Malla computacional - Detalles\nFigure 3 - Computational mesh - Details.\nQ1.PGL07.SF-S.A\nQ1.PGL07.SF-S.A\n75.0\n50.0\n25.0\nTempo [s]\nVista externa - MOBO\nVista interna - MOBO\nIntake 2\n>\n4,0 mm\nPorcentagem de g\u00e1s livre\n100.0\nIntake 1\t4\u2019\u00b0 mm\nQ1.PGL07.SF-S.A ,\nFigure 4 - Visualization of the segregation phase in the MOBO, PG 7.0% Shroud without side holes and water flow rate of 9.02L/min.\nFigura 4 - Visualiza\u00e7\u00e3o de fase da segrega\u00e7\u00e3o na MOBO, PG 7,0% Shroud sem orif\u00edcios laterais e taxa de fluxo de \u00e1gua 9.02L/min.\nFigura 4 - Visuali-zaci\u00f3n de la fase de segregation en la MOBO, PG 7,0% Shroud sin orificios laterales, y la tasa de flujo de agua 9.02L/ min.\nFrom figure 5, which shows the graph of the simulation MOBO equipped with a shroud without side holes and under 7.0% of PG and 9.02L/min of water flow rate, both measured at the entrance of MOBO, it can be inferred that:\n\u2022 the stabilization of pressure in the Shroud (P_Shroud) and the increased pressure at the entrance of the MOBO (P_Entrada) is a demonstration of the accumulation of gas (air) in the dummy well/shroud annulus\nTe np o [ s]\nFigure 5 - PG and Pressure monitoring in the MOBO, PG 7.0% Shroud without side holes and water flow rate of 9.02L/min.\nFigura 5 - PG e monitoramento de press\u00e3o na MOBO, PG 7,0% Shroud sem orif\u00edcios laterais e taxa de fluxo de \u00e1gua 9.02L/min.\nFigura 5 - PG y control de la presi\u00f3n en la MOBO, PG 7,0% Shroud sin orificios laterales, y la tasa de flujo de agua 9.02L/ min.\nFigure 6 - View with fluid discharge from the dummy well/ shroud annulus region, PG 7.0% Shroud without side holes and water flow rate 9.02L/min.\nFigura 6 - Figura 6.

(2007);\n\u2022\tit establishes a dynamic fluid level, characterized by the difference of pressure values in the shroud (P_Shroud) and the MOBO entrance (P_Entrada). Sometimes there is a very sharp decrease of this difference, featuring a temporary discharge in the dummy well/shroud annulus region (presence of air only);\n\u2022\twhile there is not a discharge in the dummy well/shroud annulus region, a biphasic current that reaches the area that represents the ESP's intake is typically showing the same percentage of free gas found at the MOBO's entrance area. For the simulated conditions, the discharge in the dummy well/shroud annulus region occurs around 115.0 seconds and then a stabilization of the percentage of free gas within the MOBO is obtained. However, sometimes free gas arrives at the ESP intake;\n\u2022\tthe average pressure at the MOBO entrance (P_Entra-da) shown by the simulation, in the stabilization period, was 50.000Pa (0.5kgf/cm2), implying a prediction error of -17.0% compared to that measured value in the experimental test (table 1);\n\u2022\tfigure 6 presents an overview of the percentage of free gas (PG), internal and external views of the MOBO, and the arrival of free gas rich biphasic stream at the ESP intake.\nSimulation results - shroud with side holes - MOBO with 7.0% of PG and 9.02L/min of water\nThe results obtained with the Simulation Pumping Module containing the shroud with side holes also showed a good agreement with the experimental results.

This difference reflects how much pressure is needed to establish the flow in the dummy well/shroud annulus region. For the simulated conditions, as the flow pressure difference in the accumulation of gas in the dummy well/shroud annulus region is almost negligible, we can then consider that the difference between the value established by the pressures P_Shroud and P_Entrada is the pressure drop for the flow of a new biphasic current within the MOBO model;\n\u2022\twhen making a combined analysis of the results shown in figures 8 and 9, which is monitoring the PG at holes 1 to 5 on the shroud lateral wall, it can be conclude that the discontinuity that appears in the pressure and PG profiles monitored from figure 8 - approximately 142.0 seconds of simulation - is caused by the passage of a gas stream in the shroud side holes 1,2, 3, 4 and 5;\n\u2022\tupon extending the analysis to the results given in figure 9, it can be inferred that the dynamic level of current biphasic settles near the third hole (something around 1.6 meters away from the MOBO Model entrance), however, in the other holes below, the PG does not reach 0.5%. This dynamic level value, corroborates well with the 1.3m experimentally determined value from the MOBO entrance;\n\u2022\tthe average pressure at the MOBO entrance (P_En-trada) indicated by the simulation in the stabilization period was 30.000Pa (0.30kgf/cm2). It indicates an error prediction of only -6.0% when compared with the experimentally measured value;\n\u2022\tin figure 10, which presents a visualization of simulation with PG 8% in the stabilization period for the P_En-trada and P_Shroud pressure values, the first hole can be seen to be quite taken by air, as observed experimentally, and the fourth hole shows the passage of an air pocket. It should be noted in the simulated conditions neither intake 1 or 2 shows a PGL above 14.0%.\nTempo [s]\nPGL-Intakel [%] PGL -Intake2[%] PGL -MOBO [%]\tP Shroud [ Pa] ^^P.Entrada [Pa ]\nFigure 8 - PG and Pressure monitoring in the MOBO, PG 8.0% Shroud with side holes and water flow rate 9.02L/min.\nFigura 8 - PG e monitoramento de press\u00e3o na MOBO, PG 8,0% Shroud com orif\u00edcios laterais e taxa de fluxo de \u00e1gua 9.02L/min.\nFigura 8 - PG y control de la presi\u00f3n en la MOBO, PG 8,0% Shroud con orificios laterales y la tasa de caudal de agua 9.02L/ min.\nFigura 9 - Control de PG en los orificios laterales de 1 a 5 del Shroud.\nFigura 9 - Monitoramento de PG nos orif\u00edcios laterais de 1 \u00e1 5 do Shroud.\nFigure 9 - Monitoring of PG in shroud holes 1 to 5.\nSimulation results - shroud with and without side holes - MOBO with 40.0% of PG and Total Flow Rate of 22.8L/min\nSeeking to establish an exploratory flow dynamics analysis, from a biphasic stream typically viscous with the presence of free gas at the entrance of the MOBO, two sets of simulations were conducted that adopted as input some expected operating conditions and fluid properties found in the Campos Basin. These two sets of simulations included the shroud with and without holes and the whole MOBO subjected to 40% of PG and under a total flow of 22.8L/min at MOBO entrance. It was then found that the flow rate imposed as a boundary condition, determined a liquid velocity profile, within the model, that caused the MOBO to drag on the gas bubbles, leading to a decrease in the bubble coalescence and also reducing the residence time, which ultimately leads to less segregation of the oil and gas phases. The viscosity of the oil phase associated with the interfacial interactions of the oil and gas generate stabilization of the bubbles and hinders the mobility of the bubbles, resulting in the reduction of possible breaks or coalescence for shocks.\nAnalyzing the pressure results and PG profiles given in figures 11 and 12 the following statements can be written:\n\u2022\tthe MOBO inlet pressure (P_Entrada) and the shroud pressure (P_Shroud) present a very similar profile for both simulations;\n\u2022\tthe profile curve of PG-MOBO for the two simulations also looks rather similar and almost takes, after stabilization, a final and common value of 40% for PG;\n\u2022\tone of the possible conclusions made by comparing the PG profiles in the Intake 1 and Intake 2 in both simulations, is the presence of holes in the shroud provides a more homogeneous morphology for the biphasic stream that reaches the simulated ESP intake region;\n\u2022\tit is also observed with the simulation with holes in the shroud, it is able to anticipate the arrival of the biphasic stream in the Intakes when compared to simulation without holes in the shroud.\nQ1.PGL08.CF-S.A\n100.0 n\n50.0\n25.0\n0.0 \u25a0\u20141\nTempo [s]\nIntake 1\nVista externa - MOBO\nVista interna - MOBO\nFigure 10 - MOBO view in the pressure stabilization period.\nFigura 10 - Vista da MOBO em o per\u00edodo de estabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o da press\u00e3o.\nFigura 10 - Vista de la MOBO en el per\u00edodo de estabilizaci\u00f3n de la presi\u00f3n.\n0.4 mm\nQ1.PGL08.CF-S.A\nFuros 1,4 e 8\n\u25bc\n1,0 mm\nQ1.PGL08.CF-S.A\nPorcentagem de g\u00e1s livre \u2022\nhi\n/ ,\nF4\n5,79E+06\n5,76E+06\n5,74E+06\n50,0\n45,0\n40,0\n35,0\n30,0\n25,0\n20,0\n15,0\n10,0\n5,0\n0,0\n5,80E+06\n5,78E+06\n5,77E+06\n5,71E+06\n5,75E+06\no tC3\n5,73 E+0 6\n5,72E+06\nTempo [s]\n\u2014 5,70E+06\n130\n>PGL- Intake 1 [%]\nPGL - Intake2 [%]\nPGL - MOBO [%]\nPEntrada [ Pa ]\nFigure 11 - Pressure Monitoring and PG in the MOBO without holes in the Shroud (Oil and Gas).\nFigura 11 - Monitoramento da Press\u00e3o e PG na MOBO, sem orif\u00edcios laterais no Shroud (Petr\u00f3leo e G\u00e1s).\nFigura 11 - Control de la Presi\u00f3n y PG en la MOBO sin orificios laterales en el Shroud (Petr\u00f3leo y Gas).\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThis study found that the computational results showed good agreement with experimental results and also indicated that holes in the shroud expressively attenuate phase\ndiscontinuities in the pump suction region, minimizing gas discharge events in the dummy well/shroud annulus region.
