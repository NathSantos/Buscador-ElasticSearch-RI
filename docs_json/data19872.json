The purpose of this paper is to present the first data concerning the diet of  Aristaeopsis\nedwardsiana, an abundant deep-water predator off Southeastern and Southern Brazilian coast. The diet of\nA. edwardsiana is composed mainly of benthic and benthopelagic organisms. Crustaceans were the most\nimportant prey item in the diet, followed by sediment, fishes, cephalopods, anthozoans, polychaetes, and\nechinoderms.  A redundancy  analysis  (RDA)  was  used  to  assess  the  relative  importance  of  different\nenvironmental  and  biological  variables  influencing  the  feeding  habits  of  Aristaeopsis  edwardsiana.\nCephalopods are mostly ingested during the spring, inversely, sediment was more important during the\nsummer. Fishes are preferentially ingested by large and sexually mature individuals, while anthozoans are\npreferred by small individuals. Espir\u00edto-Santo coast presented more individuals that prefer to eat more\nsediment than fishes or cephalopods. The majority of the stomachs were moderately empty or moderately\nfull  and  few  stomachs  were  full  or  very  full.  Significant  differences  were  found  in  the  percentage  of\nstomach  fullness  between  sex,  size  and  female  maturation.  Males,  small  individuals  and  immature\nfemales had the highest values of stomach fullness.  The variation in diet appears to be related to gonad\ndevelopment, driving temporal changes in feeding strategy. \n\nKeywords: Deep-sea shrimp; continental slope; crustacean; diet; scarlet-shrimp\n\nRESUMO.

A dieta de  A. edwardsiana \u00e9 composta\nprincipalmente por organismos bent\u00f4nicos e bent\u00f4pel\u00e1gicos. Os crust\u00e1ceos foram o mais importante item\nda  dieta,  seguido  por  sedimentos,  peixes,  cefal\u00f3podes,  antozo\u00e1rios,  poliquetas  e  equinodermos.

DE REZENDE ET AL.\n\nIntroduction\nFive species of three genera from Aristeidae\n\nfamily (Aristeus, Aristeaeopsis and Aristaeomorpha)\nare  valuable resources  in many  parts  of the  world,\nsupporting  important  commercial  fisheries,\nespecially  in  Europe  (Belcari  et  al.  2003).  In\nBrazilian  waters  these  deep-sea  shrimps,\nAristaeopsis  edwardsiana  (Johnson  1867),\nAristaeomorpha  foliacea,  and  Aristaeus  antillensis\nhave  become  valuable  targets  of  the  Brazilian\ndeep-water  trawling  fishery  as  a  result  of  a\ngovernment  support  to  exploit  fishery  resources  in\nareas of the continental slope (Pezzuto  et al.  2006).\nAristaeopsis edwardsiana  is the main component of\nthe  catches,  comprising  88.4%  of  the  total  shrimp\nproduction  conducted  by  chartered  trawlers  off\nBrazilian coast between 2000 and 2004 (Pezzuto  et\nal. 2006). Also known as \u201ccarabineiro\u201d or the scarlet\nshrimp,  Aristaeopsis  edwardsiana  is  predominantly\na  deep-water  species,  and  is  often  found  at  depths\nbetween  400  and  900  m  (D\u2019Incao 1998),  however,\nmost of the catch is restricted to depths between 700\nand 750 m (Pezzuto et al. 2006). \n\nLagard\u00e8re (1972) and Rainer (1992) studied the\ndiet of A. edwardsiana along the coasts of Morocco\nand Australia,  respectively, and  recorded  a  diverse\ndiet  for  this  species,  mostly  composed  of  fishes,\ncrustaceans, and squids. The diet and feeding habits\nof  other  aristeid  shrimps,  such  as  Aristaeomorpha\nfoliacea  and  Aristeus  antennatus,  have  been\nextensively studied (Chartosia et al. 2005,  Cartes et\nal. 2008 Kapiris  et  al.  2010,  Nouar  et  al.  2011).\nAristeids  are  among  the  megabenthic  predators\nwhose  diet  is  composed  of  a  wide  variety  of\norganisms  (i.e.  benthic  and  zooplanktonic\ncrustaceans;  mobile  prey,  such  as  fishes  or\ncephalopods;  detritus;  echinoderms;  and\npolychaetes),  being important  in  the trophic  chains\nof  deep-sea  communities  (Cartes  1994,  Cartes  &amp;\nCarrass\u00f3n 2004, Kapiris et al. 2010). \n\nTrophic relationships is an important approach\nfor understanding the organization of communities,\nas  interactions  with  biological  and  environmental\nvariables can influence the choice of food resources\nexploited  by  species,  like  changes  in  feeding\nstrategy  related  to  sexual  development  (Kapiris  &amp;\nThessalou-Legaki 2011, Kapiris 2012). Additionally,\nmany deep-sea species shows feeding patterns that is\nrelated with the temporal and seasonal distributions\nof their prey (Gartner et al, 1997). However, there is\na lack of studies on the feeding habitats of aristeid\nshrimps in Brazilian coastal waters. The aim of the\npresent study was to provide a first description of the\n\ndiet  and  feeding  habits  and  to  assess  the  relative\nimportance of different environmental and biological\nvariables  influencing  the  feeding  habits  of\nAristaeopsis edwardsiana inhabiting the continental\nslope of the southeastern and southern sectors of the\nBrazilian coast.\n\nMethods\nThe  shrimps  were  collected  by  observers\n\naboard  commercial  vessels  that  operated  on  the\ncontinental slope off the Southeastern and Southern\nBrazilian coasts (18\u00b0S-28\u00b0S, 665-766 m deep) (Fig.\n1)  between  February  2003  and  January  2007.  The\nstudy  area  was  subdivided  into  three  regions:  the\nEsp\u00edrito Santo coast (18\u00b0S-21\u00b0S), the Rio de Janeiro\n-  S\u00e3o  Paulo  coast  (23\u00b0S-25\u00b0S),  and  the  Paran\u00e1  -\nSanta  Catarina  coast  (26\u00b0S-27\u00b0S).  The  Esp\u00edrito\nSanto coast is known to possess diverse background\nmorphology,  with  the  presence  of  significant\nsubmarine  canyons  and  a  series  of  protuberances\n(cones  and  plateaus)  between  100  and  1000  m  in\ndepth; however, the regions of the Rio de Janeiro  -\nS\u00e3o  Paulo  coast  and  the  Paran\u00e1  -  Santa  Catarina\ncoast are less irregular (MMA, 2006). \n\nData on the position, date, hour, depth (m) of\neach  trawl  were  recorded.  After  each  tow,  the\nstomachs were fixed in formalin (10%) and stored in\n70% alcohol  to keep preserved and enable a better\nmanipulation.  Sex  was determined  macroscopically\nby  the  presence  of  a  petasma  in  males  and  a\nthelycum  in  females.  Carapace  length  (CL)  was\nmeasured  (accuracy,  1  mm)  from  the  orbit  to  the\ndorsal  mid-point  of  the  posterior  margin  of  the\ncarapace  using  sliding  calipers.  Males  were\nclassified  according  to  maturation  stage:  terminal\nampullae  empty  (immature)  or  filled  with  sperm\n(mature)  (Sard\u00e0  &amp;  Demestre  1989).  Females  were\nclassified according presence (impregnated; mature)\nor  absence  (not  impregnated;  imature)  of\nspermatophores  plugged  in  their  telicum  (Sard\u00e1  &amp;\nDemestre  1989) and to a  macroscopic examination\nof  the  gonads:  I-immature,  translucent  ovary;\nII-incipient maturity, orange ovarian; and III-mature,\nbrown  ovary  (Gu\u00e9guen  1998).  The  percentage  of\nstomach  fullness  (%SF)  was  estimated  as  %SF  =\n(SWW/BWW)  *  100,  where  SWW is  the  stomach\n(with  contents)  wet  weight  (g)  and  BWW  is  the\nshrimp  body  wet  weight  (g)  (H\u00e9roux  &amp;  Magnan\n1996).  One-way  ANOVA was  used  to verify if the\npercentage  of  stomach fullness  varied according  to\nsex,  size,  season,  maturation  stage,  and  area.  The\ndata  were  transformed  (log10(x+1))  to  satisfy  the\nassumptions of normality and homoscedasticity.\n\nPan-American Journal of Aquatic Sciences (2014), 9(3):167-178\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385110112001542#bb0195\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385110112001542#bb0195\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385110112001542#bb0195\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385110112001542#bb0195\n\n\nFeeding habits of Aristaeopsis edwardsiana 169\n\nFigure 1. Study area, Southeastern and Southern regions of the Brazilian coast, with emphasis on the continental slope\nbetween  500  m  and  1000  m  depth,  and  latitudinal  limits  of  the  fishing  sectors  of  Aristaeopsis  edwardsiana.  Dots\nrepresent the locations of capture.\n\nThe statistical package used was Statistica 7.0. The\ndegree of stomach fullness was estimated based on\nthe highest value of %SF, which was considered as\n100%  full,  resulting  in  the  following  classes:  very\nfull  (<100%  and  >75%),  full  (<75%  and  >50%),\nmoderately  full  (<50%  and  >25%),  moderately\nempty (<25%), and empty (<1%). Exceptions were\nstomachs  with  no  contents,  which  were  visually\nclassified  as  empty.  Tukey's  Multiple  Range  Test\nwas  used  to  determine  significant  differences\nbetween group means.\n\nThe  food  items  were  examined  under  a\nstereoscopic microscope and identified to the lowest\ntaxonomic level possible. The quantification of food\nitems was performed using two methods: the relative\nfrequency  of  occurrence  and  the  points  method\n(Williams 1981,  Wear &amp; Haddon 1987). The index\nof  food  importance  (IAi)  (Kawakami  &amp;  Vazzoler\n1980)  was  also  used  as  a  complementary  index  to\n\nindicate  the  relative  importance  of  certain  food\ncategories.\n\nThe  diet  composition  was  summarized  by  the\nrelative frequency of occurrence of the food item i\n(FO%) and was calculated as the ratio between the\nnumber of stomachs containing a food item i (FO)\nand the total number of stomachs with food content\n(n):\n\n??\n\nFO% ? (FO ? n) ? 100  \n(Williams  1981).  Empty  stomachs  were  eliminated\nfrom this analysis. The relative contribution of each\nfood item i (RCi) in a stomach was evaluated by the\npoints method,  and was subjectively classified into\nfive  categories:  0-5%  =  2.5  points,  5.1-35%  =  25\npoints, 35.1-65% = 50 points, 65.1-95% = 75 points,\nand  95.1-100%  =  100  points.  Further,  RCi  was\nweighted  according  to  the  degree  of  fullness  of\nstomachs  in  which  a  food  item  i  was  found,  as\nfollows:  moderately  empty,  0.25;  moderately  full,\n\nPan-American Journal of Aquatic Sciences (2014), 9(3):167-178\n\n\n\n170 G. A. DE REZENDE ET AL.\n\n0.5; full, 0.75; and very full, 1.00 (Wear &amp; Haddon\n1987).  This  resulted  in  the  absolute  frequency  of\npoints  for  a  food  item  i  found  in  the  foregut  j\n(PFaij). The relative frequency of points (FP%) of a\nfood item was estimated as \n\n??\n\nFP% ? (PFaij ? A) ?100\nj ? i\n\nn\n\n?\n, \n\nwhere  A is  the  total  number  of  points  for  all  food\nitems found in all stomachs, aij is the total number\nof points found for the item i in all stomachs, and n\nis the number of stomachs (Williams 1981).\n\nMultivariate analysis was used to determine the\nrelationships  between  the  diet  composition  and\nbiological  and  environmental  variables  (sex,  size,\nseason, male and female maturation stage, and area).\nA  detrended  correspondence  analysis  (DCA)\nrevealed that the ordination axes were smaller than\none and a  half standard  deviations,  suggesting that\nredundancy analysis (RDA) was the proper method\nto  relate  two  sets  of  variables. The  inflation  factor\ncalculated during RDA showed that the variable sex\npresented high collienarity. Strong collinearity may\naffect  the  ability  to  correctly  estimate  model\nparameters, therefore dataset was reduced by leaving\nout  the  sex  (Legendre  &amp;  Legendre  1998).  The\nstatistical  significance  of  the  variables  extracted\nfrom  the  RDA  was  estimated  by  a  Monte  Carlo\npermutation  test  (1000  simulations)  (Lep\u0161  &amp;\n\u0160milauer 2003). As in Magnan et al. (1994) a cut-off\npoint of p=0.10 was used in this routine.\n\nResults\nThe  most  conspicuous  components  of  the  diet\n\nof  Aristaeopsis  edwardsiana  were  sediment,\ncarapaces of crustaceans and molluscs shells, corals,\nsponge  spicules,  hard  parts  of  cephalopods  (beaks,\nsucker rings,  sucker hooks,  and eye-lens),  and  fish\nvertebrae.  Items  that  could  not  be  identified  were\nclassified as undetermined organic matter (UOM). \n\nAccording  to  the  ranking  of  IAi,  crustaceans\nwere the main prey item in the diet of Aristaeopsis\nedwardsiana,  followed  by  sediment,  fishes,\ncephalopods,  anthozoans,  polychaetes,  and\nechinoderms  (Table  I;  Fig.  2).  The  ranking  of  the\nfrequency of occurrence was in agreement with the\nranking  of  IAi  for  most  food  items,  with  the\nexception  of  cephalopods,  which  have  a  greater\nfrequency of occurrence than the fishes.\n\nThe  items  such  as  porifera  spicules,\nforaminiferans,  and  shells  of  bivalves  and\ngastropods  (all  around  1  mm)  were  considered  as\n\nincidental prey, because we assumed that these items\nwere passively ingested along with the substratum.\nThis  conclusion  was  based  on  the  fact  that  such\nitems were recorded mainly in stomachs containing\nlarge  quantities  of  sediment.  Plastic  intake  was\nobserved in stomachs filled with various food items,\nindicating incidental ingestion (Rezende et al. 2011).\n\nThe carapace length ranged from 26.80 to 99.30\nmm  in  females  (128  females  examined)  and  from\n31.35 to 69.45 mm  in males (98 males examined).\nFor statistical analyzes four size classes were used:&lt;\n49.9  mm;  50-64.9  mm,  65-79.9  mm,  >80  mm.  A\ntotal  of  226  individuals  were  analysed,  table  II\nsummarize  the  number  of  individuals  for  each\nvariable examined.\n\nThe  RDA performed  shows  that  spring,  small\nindividual (> 50 mm), impregnate females, summer\nand  Espir\u00edto  Santo  coast  are  the  most  important\nenvironmental  variables  (p  &lt; 0.10)  influencing  the\ndiet  composition  (Table  III,  Fig.  3).  The  forward\nselection  procedure  has  not  retained  the  remaining\nvariables.  However,  the  non-significant  variables\nwere included in the final ordination diagram of the\nRDA due to their importance in explaining the diet\nvariations.  The  first  two  RDA  ordination  axes\naccount for 81.8 % of total variance.\n\nAccording  to  RDA  graph  (Fig.  3)  it  was\npossible  to  observe  that  during  spring  cephalopods\nwere the most important item and sediment seems to\nhave  little  importance.  However,  in  summer  the\nopposite takes place, with shrimps feeding mostly on\nsediment.  As  females  become  mature  (impregnate\nand stage III of gonad development), fishes become\nmore  important,  while  immature  individuals  ingest\nmore  sediment.  Yet,  small  individuals  prefer\nanthozoans and sediments, and large shrimps prefer\ncephalopods  and  fishes.  Regarding  to  the  area,  the\nindividuals  captured  from  the  Esp\u00edrito  Santo  coast\nconsumed  more  sediment  and  fewer  fishes  and\ncephalopods than the individuals captured from the\nRio  de  Janeiro  -  S\u00e3o  Paulo  and  Paran\u00e1  -  Santa\nCatarina coasts.\n\nThe  highest  value  of  percentage  stomach\nfullness  (%SF)  found  in  Aristaeopsis  edwardsiana\nwas 5.95%, and this value corresponded to a 100%\nfull  stomach.  Of  the  202  individuals  analysed,  10\nhad their  degree  of  fullness  visually determined as\nempty. According  to  the  degree  of  fullness,  it  was\nobserved  that  the  majority  of  the  stomachs  were\nmoderately empty (63.4%), followed by moderately\nfull  (24.3%).  A  few  stomachs  were  between  full\n(3.9%)  and  very  full  (1.9%),  whereas  empty\nstomachs were present in 6% of individuals.\n\nPan-American Journal of Aquatic Sciences (2014), 9(3):167-178\n\n\n\nFeeding habits of Aristaeopsis edwardsiana 171\n\nTable I.

Relating  the  percentage  of\nstomach  fullness  values  to  the  degree  of  fullness\nclasses,  all  variables  presented,  on  average,\nmoderately  empty  stomachs.  Males,  small\nindividuals (&lt;50mm and 50-65 mm) and immature\nfemales had the highest values of stomach fullness.\nWhile,  females,  large  individuals  (65-80  mm  and\n>80 mm) and mature females presented less stomach\nfullness (Fig. 4). \n\nDiscussion\nIn  Brazilian  waters,  Aristaeopsis  edwardsiana\n\nhas  a  diet  similar  to  that  previously  to  aristeid\nshrimps.  Lagard\u00e8re  (1972)  and  Rainer  (1992)\nrecorded a similar diet for this species. The diet of\ntwo  other  species  of  aristeid  shrimps,  Aristeus\nantennatus and  Aristaemorpha  foliacea, is  also\nmainly  composed  of  crustaceans,  fishes,  and\ncephalopods,  with  some  quantities  of  polychaetes,\nechinoderms, gastropods, and bivalves (Chartosia et\nal. 2005). \n\nThe stomach contents recorded in  Aristaeopsis\nedwardsiana  usually  contained  only  hard  parts\nhighly fragmented. Lagard\u00e8re (1972) also point out\nthis problem, saying that the species grind their food\nand ingest  only small  fragments. Since the state of\npreys most of the items could only be identified at a\nhigher taxonomic level. The retention time for these\nis likely to be greater than that for soft tissues, which\ncould explain why soft tissues and other prey items\nwere not frequently found in the low-level digestion\nconditions. \n\nIt  was  not  possible  to  provide  more  precise\ninformation  about  the  habitat  of  the  prey,  i.e.\nwhether  they  are  pelagic  or  benthic.  However,  the\nhigh  frequency  of  occurrence  of  fishes  and\ncephalopods  in  the  diet,  in  addition  to  the\nmorphological  characteristics  of  Aristaeopsis\nedwardsiana,  such  as  light  exoskeletons  and  long\npleopods,  suggesting  good  swimming  ability\n(Gu\u00e9guen 1997), is evidence that the specie feeds on\npelagic forms. As well as on benthic forms, by the\nfrequent occurrence of sediment, anthozoa and other\nbenthic forms depending of the life time.\n\nPan-American Journal of Aquatic Sciences (2014), 9(3):167-178\n\n\n\n174 G.

However, a  pattern  of\nmass  spawning,  followed  by  the  death  of  the\nspawners, is known in many cephalopods (Boyle &amp;\nRodhouse, 2005). This indicates that it is likely that\nthe  consumption  of  demersal  decapods  is  achieved\nby feeding on dead or dying cephalopods. \n\nComparison of diet composition of this species on\nthe  Brazilian  coast  reveals  that  this  shrimp  species\nundergoes changes in feeding habits with increasing body\nsize.  With  an  increase  in  size,  individuals  cease  to\nconsume sediment and anthozoans, and switch their diet\nto  larger  and  more  energetic  prey, such  as  fishes  and\ncephalopods. Ontogenetic shifts in diet were also apparent\nin Aristaeomorpha foliacea, despite high dietary overlaps\namong  small,  medium,  and  large  females.  Large\nindividuals,  who  are  more  efficient  predators,  selected\nhighly  mobile  prey  (e.g.  fishes),  whereas  small\nindividuals consumed low-mobility prey (e.g. copepods,\nostracods, tanaids, and sipunculans) (Kapiris et al. 2010). \n\nIn  aristeid  shrimps,  sexual  and  ontogenetic\nsegregation  have  been  observed  along  different\nbathymetric gradients, in which the largest catch of\nmature  spawning  females  occurs  along  the  open\nslope,  and  juveniles  and  males  are  caught  in\nabundance near the canyons (Sard\u00e0 &amp; Cartes 1993,\nSard\u00e0  et  al.  1994,  Relini  et  al. 1999,  Tudela  et  al.\n2003).  This  ontogenetic  and  sexual  segregation\ncould  explain  the  difference  found  in  the  diet\nbetween the individuals of the Esp\u00edrito Santo coast,\nRio de Janeiro - S\u00e3o Paulo coast, and Paran\u00e1 - Santa\nCatarina  coast.  Additionally,  it  was  observed  that\nalong  the  Esp\u00edrito  Santo  coast,  of  the  females\ncaptured,  only 6% were mature,  whereas along the\nRio de Janeiro  -  S\u00e3o Paulo  coast  and  the Paran\u00e1  -\nSanta  Catarina  coast,  17%  and  20%  of  captured\nfemales,  respectively,  were  mature.  A diet  rich  in\nfish  and  cephalopods,  appropriate  for  mature\nfemales, was found in the stomachs of the shrimps\nalong  the  Rio  de  Janeiro  -  S\u00e3o  Paulo  coast  and\nParan\u00e1 - Santa Catarina coast,  where we found the\ngreatest  abundance  of  mature  females.  However,\nthere are no previous studies in the area that attest\nthis  hypothesis.  Seasons  have  an  influence  on  the\ndiet of the deep-sea megafauna, and this is possibly\nrelated  to  the  period  of  highest  abundance  of  each\nprey group in the environment (Cartes 1994, Fanelli\n&amp; Cartes 2008).\n\nPan-American Journal of Aquatic Sciences (2014), 9(3):167-178\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385110112001542#bb0110\n\n\nFeeding habits of Aristaeopsis edwardsiana 175\n\nFigure  4. Percentage  of  stomach  fullness  (%SF)  by  sex  (A),  size  (B)  and  female  maturation  of  Aristaeopsis\nedwardsiana classified according to a macroscopic examination of the gonads (C) and the presence (impregnated) or\nabsence  (not  impregnated)  of  spermatophores  plugged  in  their  telicum  (D).  The  vertical  bars  indicate  the  95%\nconfidence interval, with the minimum and maximum values. \n\nHowever,  several  studies  have  shown  that\nbiological  processes,  such  as  gonad  development,\nare also responsible for the seasonal patterns in the\ndiet  of  aristeids  (Cartes  et  al. 2008,  Kapiris  et  al.\n2010, Nouar et al. 2011) During spring, RDA results\nshowed  that  the  ingestion  of  cephalopods  becomes\nsignificant. Additionally, it was observed that higher\nproportions  of  mature  females  of  Aristaeopsis\nedwardsiana occur  in  Brazilian  waters  in  spring\n(Pezzuto  &amp;  Dias  2007,  Dias  2009).  These  facts\nsupport the finding that the seasonal feeding habits\nof  Aristaeopsis  edwardsiana  seem  to  be  related  to\nreproduction. In shrimps maintained in captivity, the\nvalue  of  several  food  items  for  maturation  and\nreproduction is attributed to their cholesterol content\n(Ravid  et  al. 1999,  Wouters  et  al. 2001,  D\u00edaz  &amp;\nFenucci  2004).  This  is  because,  like  most\ninvertebrates,  crustaceans  are  incapable  of\nsynthesizing cholesterol; thus these lipids need to be\n\ningested along with the food (Shmidt-Nielsen 2002).\nMendoza  et  al.  (1997)  showed  that  squid  is  a  rich\ncholesterol source, and also contains sexual steroids\nthat trigger shrimp vitellogenesis.\n\nFor  aristeids,  many  authors  describe  higher\nfeeding activity (higher values of stomach fullness)\nfor  large  females,  explained  by  the  increased\nmetabolic  demands  at  the  beginning  of  oogenesis\n(Maynou &amp; Cartes 1998; Cartes et al. 2008, Kapiris\net al. 2010). This work found the opposite scenario,\nin  which  males,  small  shrimps  and  immature\nfemales  presented  higher  stomach  fullness  than\nfemales,  large  shrimps,  and  mature  females.  We\nbelieve this could be due to the high-level digestion\nconditions  present  in  most  analyzed  stomach\ncontents,  which  can  interfere  with  the  accuracy  of\nthe analysis depending on the main item ingested by\neach group.\n\nMost  analyzed  stomach  contents  presented\n\nPan-American Journal of Aquatic Sciences (2014), 9(3):167-178\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385110112001542#bb0195\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385110112001542#bb0195\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385110112001542#bb0195\n\n\n176 G. A. DE REZENDE ET AL.\n\nhigh-level  digestion  conditions  that  can  interfere\nwith  the  accuracy  of  the  analysis.  Higher\noccurrences  of  anthozoans,  sediment  and\ncrustaceans  in  males,  small  shrimps  and  immature\nfemales  could  overestimate  the  stomach  fullness\nanalysis,  since  these  items  present  more  refractory\nmaterial  that  may  be  present  in  the  stomach  for  a\nlong  time  before  capture.  Large  individuals  and\nmature  females  ingested  more  fishes  and\ncephalopods,  which  are  digested  faster  and  could,\ntherefore, be underestimated. \n\nThis could be because of the rapid digestion in\nmidwater decapods, with food being retained in the\nstomach for only a few hours (Lagard\u00e8re 1976, Roe\n1984). However, the retention time of different food\ntypes  in  the  guts  of  crustaceans  may  differ  among\nthe  prey  groups.  Hard  parts,  such  as  bones  or\nmollusc shells, may be retained in the stomach for a\nmuch longer time than fleshy tissues (Hill 1976, Joll\n1982, Wassenberg &amp; Hill 1987). \n\nReferences\nBello  G.  &amp;  Pipitone  C.  2002.
