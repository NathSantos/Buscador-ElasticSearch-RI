He was a source of inspiration and support, and the hours of patient \n\ndiscussion were invaluable. Moreover, he introduced me to the group, and made me \n\nfeel welcome since day one. I feel extremely happy that I got the opportunity to have \n\nhim as a supervisor. \n\nSecondly, I would like to thank my supervisor at the Faculty of Science of the University \n\nof Lisbon, Professor Francisco Couto, for accepting to supervise me and checking \n\nregularly if my work was progressing. I\u2019d also like to thank him for allowing me to do a \n\nshort collaboration within the project EPIWORK, which set the ground for my research \n\ncareer. \n\nI should thank Professor S\u00f8ren S\u00f8rensen for having me in his group, and Assistant \n\nProfessor Waleed Abu Al-Soud for integrating me in this project. In addition, I want to \n\nthank Associate Professor Lars H. Hansen for the times when I needed some direction, \n\nand he immediately engaged in a session of brainstorming, as well as Lea Skov \n\nHansen who never failed to help me when I asked. Also, I\u2019d like to state my sincere \n\ngratitude to the Associate Professor Emeritus Annelise Kj\u00f8ller for reviewing the \n\nmanuscript. \n\nBut since work is not just about working, I want to thank the people at MME who made \n\nmy working hours and coffee-breaks, enjoyable ones. Working in such a great \n\natmosphere was a wonderful experience! I want to thank specially Tue, Lea, Analia, \n\nStefan, Michael, Peter, Lars B. and Witold. \n\nI also want to thank my roommates Chris and Emil for all the fun and hyggeligt times. \n\nI shall also thank all of my friends and family in Portugal who have always been \n\npresent, supporting me, giving me love and care, and reminding me every day that \n\ndistance meant simply a plane ride\u2026nothing else. \n\nHowever, there were some people who had a direct effect on the turnover of this \n\nthesis, and therefore I feel their names should be clearly stated. First of all, Gil for \n\nkeeping me company every day; for sharing the tiny details of our days; for discussing \n\n\n\n   \n\nii \n \n\nsilly and more serious thoughts. Ricardo Purifica\u00e7\u00e3o for bugging me the whole year to \n\nwrite the Introduction. Carolina, Mogli, Anas and Jo\u00e3o for maintaining my insanity, with \n\nour group conversation that is about\u2026(What is it about?) And finally, Natalia Ci?ciwa \n\nand Pascaline Serra for keeping track of me all these months...for the love they shared \n\nwith me, for their friendship, for not giving up.   \n\nMost of all, I want to thank In\u00eas and Lu\u00edsa. For they made me feel home in the cold \n\nkingdoms of the north: they took care of me, they gave me colo, they told me I would \n\nbe alright. They became those people that I want to be around when I\u2019m sad; or when \n\nI\u2019m happy! They became special to me\u2026. Somehow, these two girls overcame the \n\nbarrier that I had in me when I arrived in Copenhagen, and found their way to my heart. \n\nSo\u2026if to write a thesis you need a certain state of mind, a certain focus, a certain \n\nequilibrium, they were certainly the people that made sure during this year that I had \n\nthem. And as Lu\u00edsa said in the airport, when we were running for the security, there are \n\ncertain people in life that you don\u2019t need to know for too long, to know that they are \n\ngoing to stay in your life for a long time.  \n\nFinally, I would like to thank the NSF, the Moore Foundation and the European \n\nBIOTRIANGLE project for supporting the Course on Marine Bioinformatics \"Marine \n\nOmics\u201d at the University of Delaware, to which I was fortunately selected to go, and \n\nthat was definitely a turning point for the writing of this dissertation.  \n\n \n\nThis work is dedicated to my brother Filipe, to my Av\u00f3 Fernanda and to my parents.  \n\nBut mainly to my parents, since without them, I wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to go \n\nto Denmark in first place. And they keep arguing that they are doing what they are \n\nsupposed to, but they are not \u2013 they are doing more, and they should know that I am \n\nextremely grateful, that I am not forgetting what they are giving me, and that I love \n\nthem. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\niii \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSo long, and thanks for all the fish! \n\n \n\n\n\n   \n\niv \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nv \n \n\nResumo \n\nO \u201cChallenger Deep\u201d na Fossa das Marianas \u00e9 um dos ambientes mais extremos \u00e0 \n\nface da Terra. A combina\u00e7\u00e3o da baixa temperatura de 2.5\u00baC, e a press\u00e3o de quase \n\n112MPa, devido \u00e0 coluna de \u00e1gua de 11km, tornam-no \u00fanico, e sujeito \u00e0 curiosidade \n\nhumana por esse facto. Contudo, os m\u00e9todos tradicionais de cultura microbiana em \n\nlaborat\u00f3rio tornavam muito dif\u00edcil obter uma vis\u00e3o completa da comunidade que habita \n\nesse ambiente, uma vez que nem todos os microorganismos s\u00e3o pass\u00edveis de ser \n\ncultivados, nem as condi\u00e7\u00f5es extremas simples de ser recriadas.  \n\nEm 1998, Jo Handeslman cunhou o termo \u201cMetagen\u00f3mica\u201d, ao tentar estudar a \n\nmicroflora como um todo, em vez de estudar organismos individuais, denominando-o \n\nassim de metagenoma. Desde a\u00ed que a Metagen\u00f3mica evoluiu, passando a englobar a \n\nidentifica\u00e7\u00e3o de sequ\u00eancias gen\u00f3micas duma comunidade, bem como a sua an\u00e1lise \n\nfuncional e evolutiva. \n\nA an\u00e1lise metagen\u00f3mica tipicamente inclui v\u00e1rios passos que come\u00e7am na \n\namostragem, seguindo-se a filtra\u00e7\u00e3o (embora esta seja facultativa, dependendo do \n\nobjectivo do estudo), a sequencia\u00e7\u00e3o, at\u00e9 \u00e0 an\u00e1lise das sequ\u00eancias e publica\u00e7\u00e3o dos \n\ndados gerados. Este trabalho lidou exclusivamente com os dois \u00faltimos passos.  \n\nO objectivo do trabalho foi, n\u00e3o s\u00f3 gerar mais quest\u00f5es, como \u00e9 habitual em an\u00e1lises \n\nmetagen\u00f3micas, mas tamb\u00e9m investigar que comunidade habita este ambiente, e \n\nexplorar um pouco o seu potencial metab\u00f3lico. Contudo, com a publica\u00e7\u00e3o de um \n\nestudo que descreve as mesmas amostras, surgiu o objectivo de explorar os \n\nresultados no sentido de corroborar a descoberta de que h\u00e1 consumo de oxig\u00e9nio ao \n\nlongo do sedimento. \n\nA an\u00e1lise seguiu os moldes normalmente usados em trabalhos semelhantes. De 8 \n\namostras iniciais, correspondendo a intervalos de 5cm da superf\u00edcie at\u00e9 40cm de \n\nprofundidade do sedimento, 7 foram sequenciadas. Inicialmente, as sequ\u00eancias foram \n\nautomaticamente pr\u00e9-processadas de forma a que apenas a informa\u00e7\u00e3o relevante e \n\nfidedigna passasse \u00e0 fase seguinte. Nomeadamente, removeram-se os adaptadores \n\nutilizados na sequencia\u00e7\u00e3o, bem como sequ\u00eancias demasiado curtas, e bases de m\u00e1 \n\nqualidade. Para isto, foi utilizada a colec\u00e7\u00e3o de ferramentas \u201cBiopieces\u201d, que permite \n\norganizar os comandos numa pipeline de uma forma simples e intuitiva. \n\nSeguidamente, as sequ\u00eancias foram sujeitas a assemblagem, utilizando o programa \n\nIDBA-UD, de forma a gerar sequ\u00eancias mais longas, para serem anotadas com maior \n\n\n\n   \n\nvi \n \n\npercentagem de identidade, e consequentemente, com maior confian\u00e7a. Mais uma \n\nvez, este passo \u00e9 facultativo, uma vez que ao assemblar sequ\u00eancias perde-se \n\ninforma\u00e7\u00e3o relativamente \u00e0 abund\u00e2ncia. Antes da anota\u00e7\u00e3o, as sequ\u00eancias foram \n\nclassificadas de codificantes ou n\u00e3o codificantes, e as primeiras foram ent\u00e3o \n\nmapeadas contra sequ\u00eancias conhecidas em bases de dados. A anota\u00e7\u00e3o foi feita em \n\ntermos taxon\u00f3micos e funcionais.  Todos os passos que se seguiram \u00e0 assemblagem \n\nforam realizados pelo servidor MG-RAST, no entanto, tanto sequ\u00eancias assembladas \n\n(\u201ccontigs\u201d) como n\u00e3o-assembladas (\u201creads\u201d) foram submetidas, para haver informa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nrelativamente \u00e0 abund\u00e2ncia, mas tamb\u00e9m informa\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00f3lida relativamente a \n\ndeterminadas caracter\u00edsticas de interesse. \n\nOs resultados gerados pelo MG-RAST mostram claramente que Betaproteobacteria \n\ndomina a amostra de superf\u00edcie (0-5cm), enquanto que nas restantes amostras \u00e9 a \n\nclasse Gammaproteobacteria a mais abundante. \u00c9 interessante observar que \n\nenquanto que Gammaproteobacteria nas amostras 1 (0-5cm) e 2 (5-10cm) \u00e9 dominada \n\npor um g\u00e9nero, da amostra 3 (10-15cm) \u00e0 8 (35-40cm) o n\u00famero de g\u00e9neros \n\nabundantes aumenta. Em termos de diversidade-alfa, a amostra 1 apresenta o valor \n\nmais elevado (430.83 esp\u00e9cies), em compara\u00e7\u00e3o com as outras que variam entre \n\n184.10 e 252.14 esp\u00e9cies. A diversidade-beta foi calculada entre todas as amostras, \n\nusando o pacote \u201cvegan\u201d da linguagem de programa\u00e7\u00e3o estat\u00edstica R. Especulou-se \n\nque poderia haver uma correla\u00e7\u00e3o entre esta e a profundidade, mas tal n\u00e3o se \n\nverificou. Para averiguar se haveria alguma rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre a profundidade do sedimento \n\ne a composi\u00e7\u00e3o da comunidade, utilizou-se a an\u00e1lise de componentes principais \n\n(PcoA).  Estes resultados n\u00e3o permitiram a confirma\u00e7\u00e3o da hip\u00f3tese, no entanto, ao \n\ncomparar com amostras de outros projectos bastante diferentes, as amostras da \n\nFossa das Marianas agruparam-se de modo consistente, mostrando que a \n\ncomposi\u00e7\u00e3o da comunidade \u00e9 caracter\u00edstica deste ambiente. Al\u00e9m disto, gerou-se uma \n\ncurva de rarefac\u00e7\u00e3o, que \u00e9 utilizada para verificar se o esfor\u00e7o de sequencia\u00e7\u00e3o foi \n\nsuficiente para representar a comunidade por inteiro, e dado que as curvas das 7 \n\namostras est\u00e3o a chegar perto da ass\u00edmptota, p\u00f4de-se concluir que os resultados s\u00e3o \n\nrazo\u00e1veis. \n\nEm termos funcionais, a an\u00e1lise focou-se no metabolismo energ\u00e9tico. A maior parte \n\ndas sequ\u00eancias \u201creads\u201d deste metabolismo mapeavam para fosforila\u00e7\u00e3o oxidativa, que \n\n\u00e9 o \u00faltimo passo da respira\u00e7\u00e3o aer\u00f3bia. Analisando as sequ\u00eancias \u201ccontigs\u201d que \n\nmapeavam para o mesmo, verificou-se que existia mais de 91% de identidade contra \n\nsequ\u00eancias na base de dados escolhida, o que indica que os resultados s\u00e3o cred\u00edveis.  \n\n\n\n \n\nvii \n \n\nO metabolismo do metano e do azoto foram tamb\u00e9m investigados e, apesar de menos \n\nabundantes, algumas enzimas envolvidas na metanog\u00e9nese e no ciclo do azoto foram \n\nidentificadas nas sequ\u00eancias \u201ccontigs\u201d. \n\nFinalmente, gerou-se um mapa geral com todas as enzimas identificadas nas \n\namostras, utilizando o programa iPath que se baseia nos mapas metab\u00f3licos KEGG. \u00c9 \n\nde notar, todavia, que este mapeamento pode ser err\u00f3neo, como se constatou quando \n\nse observou que a fotoss\u00edntese estava indicada como presente, o que \u00e9 altamente \n\nimprov\u00e1vel a 11km de profundidade. Quando se investigou porqu\u00ea, descobriu-se que \n\nera devido a uma ATPase que est\u00e1 presente tanto na fotoss\u00edntese como na \n\nfosforila\u00e7\u00e3o oxidativa. \n\nOs resultados gerados, permitem concluir que efectivamente o consumo de oxig\u00e9nio, \n\nmedido no estudo efectuado por colaboradores, se deve a metabolismo aer\u00f3bio \n\nmesmo nas camadas de sedimento mais profundas. Esse estudo tamb\u00e9m previu que \n\nos processos de mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o acentuados neste ambiente fossem mediados pela \n\ncomunidade microbiana, o que se coaduna com a presen\u00e7a de enzimas envolvidas no \n\nciclo do azoto. A domin\u00e2ncia de Gammaproteobacteria \u00e9 partilhada por sedimentos no \n\nOceano Pac\u00edfico a 4000m de profundidade, bem como sedimentos no Oceano Pac\u00edfico \n\n\u00c1rtico, que se encontra igualmente a baixas temperaturas. Curiosamente, a microflora \n\nde fontes hidrotermais em profundidade, a mais de 310\u00baC tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o dominadas por \n\nGammaproteobacteria. \n\nEste estudo mostrou que \u00e9 poss\u00edvel investigar em detalhe a composi\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\ncomunidade bacteriana de ambientes extremos. Contudo, este trabalho poderia ter \n\nsido mais robusto se houvesse r\u00e9plicas das unidades amostrais, e mais dados \n\ncontextuais que permitissem fazer compara\u00e7\u00f5es com outros estudos.  No futuro, seria \n\ntamb\u00e9m interessante tirar amostras a diversas profundidades do \u201cChallenger Deep\u201d de \n\nforma a estudar a varia\u00e7\u00e3o da composi\u00e7\u00e3o da comunidade com a profundidade.  \n\nUma vez que esta \u00e1rea \u00e9 ainda bastante jovem, a colec\u00e7\u00e3o de ferramentas dispon\u00edveis \n\napesar de vasta, ainda est\u00e1 sujeita a melhoramentos. Desta forma, os resultados aqui \n\napresentados poder-se-\u00e3o revelar imprecisos daqui a 10 anos. Tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 prov\u00e1vel \n\nque uma escolha alternativa n\u00e3o produzisse exactamente os mesmos resultados. \n\nAssim, o produto deste trabalho \u00e9 fruto da escolha das ferramentas e dos seus \n\npar\u00e2metros, com todas as vantagens e incovenientes que lhes s\u00e3o inerentes. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n   \n\nviii \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nix \n \n\nAbstract \n\nThe emergence of Metagenomics allowed the study of the microbial community in the \n\ndeepest point on Earth: the Challenger Deep on the Mariana Trench. Its extreme \n\nconditions, a water depth of almost 11km, a temperature of 2.5 degrees Celsius and a \n\npressure around 112 MPa, made it very difficult to perform a comprehensive study of \n\nits microecology, given the previous dependency on culturing methods. This \n\nmetagenomic analysis included taxonomic identification and exploration of some \n\nfunctional potential of the genomic sequences of the community, generated by Illumina \n\nNext-Generation Sequencing technique, therefore bypassing the need for cloning. Here \n\nwe show that Proteobacteria clearly dominate this environment but that there is no \n\nobvious correlation between the sediment depth and the community composition. \n\nMoreover, the abundance of enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation in all \n\nsamples, suggests aerobic activity within the sediment. This supports the finding that \n\nthere is oxygen consumption along the depth of the sediment. An extensive description \n\nof all the data generated was prohibitive; however as soon as the data becomes \n\navailable, it will be accessible to the public to search for their features of interest. \n\n \n\nKeywords: metagenomics, Mariana Trench, Challenger Deep, extreme environments, \n\nIllumina, community structure, energy metabolism  \n\n \n\n \n\nO aparecimento da Metagen\u00f3mica permitiu o estudo da comunidade microbiana no \n\nponto mais profundo na Terra: o \u201cChallenger Deep\u201d na Fossa das Marianas. As \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es extremas a\u00ed presentes - a coluna de \u00e1gua de quase 11km, 2.5\u00baC de \n\ntemperatura e a press\u00e3o \u00e0 volta de 112MPa - tornaram um estudo aprofundado da sua \n\nmicroecologia muito dif\u00edcil de executar, dada a pr\u00e9via depend\u00eancia em m\u00e9todos que \n\nenvolviam culturas em laborat\u00f3rio. Esta an\u00e1lise metagen\u00f3mica incluiu identifica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ntaxon\u00f3mica e a pesquisa do potencial funcional das sequ\u00eancias gen\u00f3micas da \n\ncomunidade, geradas utilizando a tecnologia de nova gera\u00e7\u00e3o de sequencia\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nIllumina, ultrapassando assim a necessidade de clonagem. Neste trabalho demonstra-\n\nse que Proteobacteria domina claramente este habitat, mas que n\u00e3o h\u00e1 uma \n\ncorrela\u00e7\u00e3o inequ\u00edvoca entre a profundidade do sedimento e a composi\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\n\n\n   \n\nx \n \n\ncomunidade. Al\u00e9m disso, a abund\u00e2ncia de enzimas envolvidas na oxida\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nfosforilativa em todas as amostras, sugere actividade aer\u00f3bia no sedimento. Isto \n\nsustenta a descoberta de que h\u00e1 consumo de oxig\u00e9nio ao longo da profundidade do \n\nsedimento. Uma descri\u00e7\u00e3o extensa de todos os dados que foram gerados era \n\nproibitivo, no entanto, assim que os dados se tornarem p\u00fablicos, ser\u00e3o acess\u00edveis a \n\ntodos os que os queiram investigar consoante os seus interesses. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: metagen\u00f3mica, Fossa das Marianas, \u201cChallenger Deep\u201d, ambientes \n\nextremos, Illumina, estrutura da comunidade, metabolismo energ\u00e9tico  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nxi \n \n\nContents \n\nAcknowledgements ........................................................................................................ i \n\nResumo ........................................................................................................................ v \n\nAbstract ....................................................................................................................... ix \n\nList of Figures ............................................................................................................. xiii \n\nList of Tables .............................................................................................................. xv \n\n1.

Introduction \n\n1.1. Background \n\nThe Challenger Deep on the Mariana Trench is one of the most extreme environments \n\non Earth, with a depth of almost 11km, a temperature of 2.5 degrees Celsius[1] and a \n\npressure around 111.79 MPa \u2013 calculated assuming the mean density of sea water \n\n1036 kg/m\n3\n[2]  and the gravity to be 9,81 m/s\n\n2\n[3]. It is located roughly at 11\u00baN 22.1\u2019N \n\n142\u00ba 25.8\u2019 E [1](Figure 1). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - Challenger Deep location (11\u00ba 22.1'N 142\u00ba 25.8' E) \n\n \n\nIt has been subject to human curiosity for many years[4], however so far, there wasn't a \n\ndetailed study of its microecology. With the emergence of Metagenomics, it was now \n\nfinally possible to unravel which organisms live in the deepest point on Earth, and what \n\nare they doing. \n\nIt was in 1998 that the term \"Metagenomics\" was first used by Jo Handeslman [5] in an \n\neffort to study the microflora as a unit, the metagenome, instead of addressing each \n\ntype of organism individually.  \n\nPreviously, it was thought that it was necessary to study the morphology, physiology \n\nand pathogenic characters in order to classify a microorganism[6], but since Woese in \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n   \n\n2 \n \n\n1977 pioneered the use of 16S sequences for classification[7], sequence comparison \n\nhas been widely used and accepted as valid to do so.  \n\nWith the development of the sequencing technology, one can now take a sample \n\ndirectly from the environment, extract its DNA, sequence it, and infer the microbial \n\ncomposition of the sample, therefore overcoming the bottleneck of growing pure \n\ncultures in the laboratory. This method enables the discovery of new forms of life that \n\nare not cultivable, and to assess the genetic richness and diversity, as well as the \n\nmetabolic potential, of a community of organisms as a whole[8]. \n\nMetagenomic analysis can accordingly be defined as \u201cthe identification, and functional \n\nand evolutionary analysis of the genomic sequences of a community of organisms\u201d.[9]  \n\nMoreover, the paradigm that most of the microbial world was known changed, to the \n\nacknowledgement that there is still a lot to know and to explore[10]. Discovering new \n\nforms of life in extreme environments can provide insights into a variety of topics, like \n\nthe biogeochemical activities that occur in the ocean[11], and the impact that human \n\nactivity may have on them[12] . \n\n1.2. Metagenomic Analysis  \n\nTo analyse a metagenome, several steps are typically involved, from the experimental \n\ndesign to sharing the data[13]. Firstly, one has to obtain the samples. Ideally, true \n\nreplicates should be taken as well. Afterwards, one may filter the samples, to target a \n\n(more-or-less) specific group of organisms [14].  \n\nThe following step is sequencing. There are several technologies to sequence DNA, \n\neach with its own advantages and weaknesses. The Mariana Trench sediment \n\nsamples were sequenced using Illumina\u2019s paired-end assay. Its advantage is that it is \n\ncheap and generates a large number of reads per run, however they are very short (50 \n\n\u2013 250 bp), which can pose a problem for assembly and comparison since it becomes \n\nmore difficult to assign a read unequivocally to a template[15]. \n\nIllumina\u2019s technology consists in attaching random DNA fragments to a surface, amplify \n\nthem to form clusters of the same sequence, and then use them as templates for \n\nrepeated cycles of polymerase-directed single base extension. This is guaranteed by \n\nusing 3?-modified nucleotides, labeled with a removable fluorophore. After determining \n\nthe identity of the nucleotide incorporated by laser-induced excitation of the \n\nfluorophores, these as well as the side arm (that prevents the incorporation of more \n\nthan one nucleotide per cycle) are removed. The images of the fluorescent signal are \n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n   \n\n3 \n \n\nused to determine the sequence (each nucleotide is attached to a fluorophore of a \n\ndifferent colour), and its quality, defined as the likelihood of each call being correct[16].  \n\nThe paired-end option means that a fragment is sequenced in both directions (5\u2019 ? 3\u2019, \n\nand 3\u2019 ? 5\u2019), therefore being helpful for the assembly[17]. \n\nAssembly is the next step in the Metagenomic analysis pipeline, although it is \n\nsometimes skipped. Its usefulness is debatable[18], given that the accuracy of the \n\nassemblers is difficult to assess, since there is currently no microbial community with \n\nknown reference sequences to compare to[13]. \n\nThe main problem with assembly is that it distorts abundance information, since \n\nabundant fragments will be considered as belonging to the most abundant species, \n\nwhen in reality they may be present in rare species[18]. Moreover, some fragments \n\nmay be incorrectly discarded as mistakes or repeats, or joined up in the wrong places \n\nor orientations[19]. Nonetheless, if these setbacks are taken into account when doing \n\nthe analysis, then assembly can be advantageous as it produces longer sequences \n\nthat are easily unambiguously annotated.  \n\nGene prediction and annotation usually follow. The first classifies the sequences as \n\ncoding or non-coding, and the second tries to find homology between the coding \n\nsequences and known sequences stored in databases. Once again, these methods \n\nhave their own flaws, mainly because they are based on models, hence failing to \n\npredict exceptions that can occur in the biological world. \n\nTypically, the final step is to share the sequence data on public databases together \n\nwith the metadata. Contextual data is necessary to compare with other datasets, \n\nessentially making the sequences useful for the database and the scientific community. \n\nBy complying with standard languages for metadata, such as MIMS, the data becomes \n\nmore accessible, as complex searches will retrieve more information[20]. \n\nThe whole set of drawbacks that are surrounding metagenomic analysis, are not at all \n\nsurprising, if one considers that it is still a very young field. A quick search on Web of \n\nKnowledge[21] for the total number of articles featuring the term \u201cmetagenome\u201d or \n\n\u201cmetagenomics\u201d, gives a very clear perception on how novel this field is, and how much \n\ndata has been produced (Figure 2). \n\nWith the popularity of the field expanding, a multitude of tools were developed making \n\nthe choice of which one to use, a not so trivial one. There is still no evident consensus \n\non which is the best tool for each step (not even for sequencing), so the errors in the \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n   \n\n4 \n \n\ndata are most likely directly related to the flaws in each method, which means that a \n\ndifferent set of methods will yield a different set of errors. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 - Total number of metagenomics articles published since 1998 \n\n  \n\nGiven this explosion of data, an obvious question is on its applicability. One example \n\nwould be bioremediation[22]. The process of biodegradation encompasses several \n\nmetabolic pathways that being considered in a community-basis, instead of an \n\nindividual-basis, lead to a global understanding of what is essential and what is \n\nsuperfluous, easing the design of such a system. Moreover, the industry sector is \n\nalways in search of novel enzymes and processes[23]. \n\nEven so, metagenomics tends to be regarded as exploratory research, raising more \n\nquestions instead of addressing them. Accordingly, the aim of this project was not only \n\nto answer some simple questions, but also to raise some more, and hopefully to \n\nencourage further studies in this environment. \n\n1.3. Objective \n\nThis project dealt solely with the analysis of the raw data output by sequencing. The \n\ngoal was to assess the taxonomical distribution of the community along the depth of \n\nthe sediment and to explore its metabolic potential, using the most adequate tools. \n\nHowever, with the publication of the article [1], which included these sediment samples, \n\nthe focus turned to assess if the data generated by this analysis would corroborate the \n\npublished data, namely to confirm the O2 consumption throughout the sediment depth. \n\n1 3 4 7 19 52 110 225 383 \n637 \n\n1,046 \n1,689 \n\n6,538 \n\n9,381 \n\n13,106 \n13,853 \n\n0 \n\n2,000 \n\n4,000 \n\n6,000 \n\n8,000 \n\n10,000 \n\n12,000 \n\n14,000 \n\nT\no\n\nta\nl \nn\n\nu\nm\n\nb\ne\nr \n\no\nf \n\na\nrt\n\nic\nle\n\ns\n \n\nYear \n\nNumber of articles with the keyword  \nmetagenome* or metagenomic* \n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n   \n\n5 \n \n\n1.4.

Methods \n\nSeven out of eight sequenced samples from different depths were analysed. Each \n\nsample corresponded to a gradient of 5cm, starting from 0-5cm (sample 1) to 35-40cm \n\n(sample 8). The data was cleaned using the collection of tools Biopieces[24], the reads \n\nassembled using IDBA-UD[25] [26], and both the generated contigs and the clean \n\nreads were submitted to MG-RAST[27]. \n\n2.1. Sample collection, preparation and sequencing \n\nThe upstream methodology was done by collaborators and consisted on the following: \n\nthe DNA was extracted from 5g of sediment collected at different depths from the \n\nChallenger Deep-Mariana Trench at 10,900m, using PowerMax soil DNA isolation kit \n\n(MoBio Laboratories, CA USA). Eight DNA samples, each corresponding to a different \n\ndepth, were sent to BGI-Shenzhen (China), for library preparation and sequencing. \n\nSince one of the samples (sample 4: 15-20 cm) did not contain enough DNA for library \n\npreparation (as reported from the Sample Test Report of BGI), 14 fastq files were \n\nreceived back, 2 for each of the seven samples \u2013 one with the forward and another \n\nwith the reverse reads. \n\n2.2. Preliminary Analysis \n\nThe initial number of reads on each sample ranged from around 41 million to almost 84 \n\nmillion (Table 1).  \n\nTable 1 - Percentage of reads removed with the cleaning \n\nSample \nNumber of raw reads \n(forward + reverse) \n\nNumber of clean \nreads \n\nPercentage of \nCleaning \n\n1 58,814,066 43,569,096 25.921% \n\n2 45,533,260 18,717,708 58.892% \n\n3 47,163,190 34,419,612 27.020% \n\n5 83,968,942 36,784,382 56.193% \n\n6 61,751,498 43,891,904 28.922% \n\n7 46,894,236 33,786,396 27.952% \n\n8 41,030,848 28,508,242 30.520% \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMethods \n\n   \n\n8 \n \n\n2.3. Biopieces \n\nSub-quality residues from the ends of the reads were removed, as well as the adaptors \n\nused in the sequencing. The reads with a length inferior to 30 bp were also excluded, in \n\naddition to reads with a local mean score under 15, to overcome errors propagated \n\nfrom cycle to cycle[28]. The cleaning removed from 27% to almost 59% of the reads in \n\nthe samples (Table 1). The Biopieces script used is shown in Figure 3. \n\nThe tool trim_seq removes residues from the ends of sequences whose quality, in the \n\nscores of the FASTQ file, does not match the minimum quality specified (in this case \n\n25). The flag \u201c-l\u201d makes sure that residues are removed until a stretch of at least 3 \n\nresidues with good quality is found, to avoid a premature termination due to a good \n\nquality residue at the end. This step is necessary to overcome the effect of phasing and \n\npre-phasing. These are caused by incomplete removal of the 3' terminators and \n\nfluorophores, sequences missing an incorporation cycle, or by the incorporation of \n\nnucleotides without effective 3' terminators[28]. This means that each cycle\u2019s signal is \n\naffected by the signal of the previous and subsequent cycles, hindering the detection of \n\nthe right base. \n\nread_fastq \u2013i - | \n\ntrim_seq \u2013m 25 \u2013l 3 | \n\nfind_adaptor \u2013l 6 \u2013L 6 \u2013f ACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT \u2013r AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTC | \n\nclip_adaptor | \n\nmerge_pair_seq | \n\ngrab \u2013e \u2018SEQ_LEN_LEFT >= 30\u2019 | \n\ngrab \u2013e \u2018SEQ_LEN_RIGHT >= 30\u2019 | \n\nmean_scores \u2013l | \n\ngrab \u2013e \u2018SCORES_MEAN_LOCAL >= 15\u2019 | \n\nsplit_pair_seq | \n\nwrite_fastq \u2013x \n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Cleaning script \n\n \n\nFind_adaptor searches the reads for the given adaptors (forward: \n\nACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and reverse: AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTC), or \n\npartial adaptors with at least 6 residues of length \u2013 flags \u201c-l\u201d for the forward and \u201c-L\u201d for \n\nthe reverse adaptor. By default, a percentage of the adaptor length is allowed for \n\nmismatches, insertions, and deletions (10%, 5% and 5%, respectively). \n\nOnce the adaptors are found, clip_adaptor removes them, based on the keys output by \n\nfind_adaptor: ADAPTOR_POS_RIGHT, ADAPTOR_POS_LEFT, and ADAPTOR_LEN_LEFT. \n\n\n\nMethods\n\n   \n\n9 \n \n\nThe merge_pair_seq merges paired sequences, as long as they are interleaved. \n\nSequence names must be in either Illumina1.3/1.5 format trailing a \u201c/1\u201d or \u201c/2\u201d or \n\nIllumina1.8 containing \u201c1:\u201d or \u201c2:\u201d. The sequence names should also match. \n\nGrab is an improved version of Unix\u2019s \u201cgrep\u201d. It selects records that match a pattern, a \n\nregular expression, or a numerical evaluation. In this case, we selected for reads with a \n\nlength superior to 30bp, by examining the keys SEQ_LEN_LEFT and \n\nSEQ_LEN_RIGHT, output by merge_pair_seq. \n\nAfterwards, mean_scores \u2013l was used to calculate the local mean scores, which means \n\nthat instead of calculating the mean as the sum of all the scores over the length of the \n\nstring, it uses means from a sliding window, and returns the smallest value.  \n\nFinally, split_pair_seq was used to split the sequences merged with merge_pair_seq.  \n\nTo speed up the process, this script was ran with GNU parallel[29] with the \u2013L 8 option, \n\nwhich takes two records at a time (each record has 4 lines), to circumvent breaking the \n\npairs.  GNU Parallel allows Biopieces to be executed in parallel using multiple CPUs on \n\nmultiple cores and servers[24]. \n\nThe merge_pair_seq and split_pair_seq tools were created within this project, to \n\novercome speed and memory problems originated by the use of order_pairs. The latter \n\ninterleaves the sequences, as long as their names are in Illumina 1.5 or 1.8 scheme, \n\nand ads a key stating if the read is \u201cpaired\u201d or \u201corphan\u201d. This should be used after the \n\ntrimming and grabbing steps, and subsequently, only the paired reads should be \n\ngrabbed. \n\nExample of a script using order_pairs (Figure 4): \n\n \n\nread_fastq \u2013i - | \n\ntrim_seq \u2013m 25 \u2013l 3 | \n\nfind_adaptor \u2013l 6 \u2013L 6 \u2013f ACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT \u2013r AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTC | \n\nclip_adaptor | \n\ngrab \u2013e \u2018SEQ_LEN >= 30\u2019 | \n\nmean_scores \u2013l | \n\ngrab \u2013e \u2018SCORES_MEAN_LOCAL >= 15\u2019 | \n\norder_pairs |                       \n\ngrab \u2013p \u2018pair\u2019 \u2013k ORDER | \n\nwrite_fastq \u2013x \n\nFigure 4 \u2013 order_pairs script \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMethods \n\n   \n\n10 \n \n\n2.4. Assembly \n\nThe decision to assemble smaller reads into larger contigs was made based on the \n\npostulation that \u201cThe longer the sequence information, the better is the ability to obtain \n\naccurate information.\u201d The annotation procedure becomes easier since longer \n\nsequences yield more information to compare with the databases, but it also applies for \n\nclassification of DNA fragments, as well as to rise the confidence in accuracy due to \n\nthe lower quality of single reads, by having multiple reads covering the same segment \n\nof information, provided that the coverage is high enough[13]. The IDBA-UD algorithm \n\nis based on de Bruijn graphs adapted for metagenomic sequencing technologies with \n\nuneven sequencing depths[26].  \n\nDe Bruijn graphs have every possible (k-1)-mer assigned to a node and it has a direct \n\nedge to another one if there is some k-mer whose prefix is the former and whose suffix \n\nis the latter. This means that all the edges in the graph represent all possible k-mers. \n\nThe idea is to find an Eulerian cycle[30] with the shortest superstring that contains each \n\nk-mer exactly once (Figure 5).  \n\nBy visiting each edge only once, the time to run the algorithm is roughly proportional to \n\nthe number of edges[31], unlike in a Hamiltonian cycle[32], where each node is visited \n\nonly once, making it an NP-complete problem[33] (meaning the time to solve it \n\nincreases quickly with the size of the input).  \n\nApplied to genome assembly, all the k-mers are the ones present in the reads \n\ngenerated by sequencing[31], so ideally, the Eulerian cycle would generate the \n\ngenome. In practice this method cannot be applied directly, since there are some \n\nassumptions that do not hold. Firstly, we cannot be sure that all the k-mers present in \n\nthe genome were generated; secondly, k-mers are not error-free; thirdly, each k-mer is \n\nvery likely to appear more than once in the genome; and lastly, we should not assume \n\nthat the genome is a single circular chromosome.  \n\nTo deal with the first problem, instead of trying to assemble the reads, the algorithm \n\nbreaks them into smaller k-mers which are more likely to be representative of the whole \n\ngenome. To handle errors, the assembler chooses the path which is supported by \n\nhigher coverage.  Regarding repeats, if a k-mer appears more than once in the \n\ngenome, it shall be represented by several edges connecting the same two nodes. \n\nFinally, rather than searching for an Eulerian cycle, if the algorithm is modified to \n\nsearch for an Eulerian path[34], then it is not required to end in the same node where it \n\nbegan[31]. \n\n\n\nMethods\n\n   \n\n11 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5 \u2013 Genome assembly strategies: Hamiltonian and Eulerian cycles[31].  \n\n \n\nThe main problem with metagenomic data is that species with different abundances will \n\nbe represented by reads with uneven depth, and this cannot be disregarded as, e.g., \n\nan amplification bias. IDBA_UD solves this problem by adopting variable thresholds on \n\nthe multiplicity of the k-mers, making them dependent on the sequencing depth of the \n\nneighboring contigs. The idea is that contigs with much lower sequencing depths that \n\ntheir neighbors are more likely erroneous[26]. Moreover, IDBA_UD uses paired-end \n\ninformation, namely the distance between the pairs, to solve issues such as missing k-\n\nmers and repeats. \n\nThe assembler IDBA_UD was firstly used with the default minimum contig size setting \n\n(200 bp), which yielded a N50 from 3545 to 9240. N50 is the length of the smallest \n\ncontig that contains the fewest largest contigs whose combined length represents no \n\nless than 50% of the assembly. It is one of the common assembly statistics[35]. \n\nTherefore, then a higher minimum contig size of 500 bp was chosen, which improved \n\nthe N50 values, so these contigs were uploaded to the server MG-RAST[27]. The \n\ncomplete analysis of both assemblies (using the Biopiece analyze_assembly) is shown \n\non Table 2 and Table 3, including N50, contig length (maximum, minimum, mean and \n\ntotal) and the number of contigs. \n\n\n\nMethods \n\n   \n\n12 \n \n\nTable 2 \u2013 Analysis of the assembly with minimum contig size 200 bp. \n\n200 bp \n\nSample 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 \n\nN50 3545 4705 4397 6430 8726 7136 9240 \n\nL\ne\nn\ng\n\nth\n \n\nMax 614,662 215,848 466,951 305,081 551,041 305,025 452,197 \n\nMin 200 200 200 200 200 200 200 \n\nMean 1439 1956 1651 2206 2068 1822 2234 \n\nTotal 106,683,337 42,414,452 79,943,730 68,959,229 61,784,508 70,790,963 64,146,341 \n\nNumber contigs 74,124 21,681 48,418 31,250 29,868 38,839 28,704 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 3 \u2013 Analysis of the assembly with minimum contig size 500 bp. \n\n500 bp \n\nSample 1 2 4 5 6 7 8 \n\nN50 14,106 6,199 14,122 8,662 17,856 16,340 16,698 \n\nL\ne\nn\ng\n\nth\n \n\nMax 614,662 215,848 548,284 305,081 551,037 337,423 551,034 \n\nMin 504 502 503 501 505 518 503 \n\nMean 3,261 3,180 3,384 3,883 4,277 4,235 4,492 \n\nTotal 76,906,252 36,624,750 60,016,272 59,604,646 51,333,136 55,864,260 54,104,132 \n\nNumber contigs 23,581 11,514 17,732 15,349 12,000 13,190 12,044 \n\n \n\n2.5. MG-RAST \n\nMG-RAST[27] uses several bioinformatics tools in its pipeline. Firstly, it filters \n\nsequences based on length, number of ambiguous bases and quality values. All the \n\ncontigs from all the 7 samples uploaded, passed this preprocessing stage.  \n\nThen, \u201ctechnical replicates\u201d, identified as sequences with identical first 50 base-pairs, \n\nare removed in a step called Dereplication. Between 0,7% (surface sample) and 2,3% \n\n(sample 7) of the contigs were removed in this step, but no reads were removed. This \n\ncan be explained by the use of the same reads for different contigs. \n\nAfter that, FragGeneScan[36] is used to predict coding regions. This tool is an ab-initio \n\ngene calling algorithm that uses hidden Markov Model for coding and non-coding \n\nregions, and that was developed specially for metagenomes. It includes codon usage \n\nbias, sequencing error models and start/stop codon patterns. A gene is reported if it\u2019s \n\nlonger than 60 bp, and begins either with a start or an internal codon of a gene and \n\nends with a stop or an internal codon. This way, both complete and partial genes are \n\npredicted. From 29,239 (sample 2) to 63,877 (sample 1) coding sequences were \n\n\n\nMethods\n\n   \n\n13 \n \n\npredicted within the contigs, and from 16,387,405 (sample 2) to 40,199,546 (sample 6) \n\nwithin the reads. \n\nThe sequences output from FragGeneScan are then clustered at 90% identity with \n\nqiime-uclust. QIIME[37] is a software package developed specially for high throughput \n\namplicon sequencing data, although it also supports metagenomic data. It incorporates \n\nmany third party tools, such as UCLUST[38]. This algorithm clusters sequences based \n\non their similarity, according to a threshold set by the user (or in this case by MG-\n\nRAST). Each cluster is therefore represented by a sequence, and all the sequences in \n\nit should have a similarity higher than the threshold to the sequence representing the \n\ncluster (centroid), and centroids should have similarity below the threshold to the other \n\ncentroids. The algorithm starts with no centroids, and each sequence is compared to \n\nthe list of centroids and it is either assigned to a cluster or selected as a new centroid. \n\nThe centroids and the singletons (unclustered sequences) are then searched using \n\nBLAT[39] against the M5NR protein database. M5NR is a non-redundant protein \n\ndatabase which incorporates data from GO[40],  KEGG[36][37], NCBI[38][39], \n\nSEED[40][41], UniProt[47], VBI[48] and eggNOG[49], and has almost 16,000,000 \n\nsequences. BLAT builds an index of the database and then scans linearly through the \n\nquery sequence, unlike BLAST which builds an index of the query sequence and then \n\nscans linearly through the database, making it faster since it does not have to scan \n\nthrough a database of gigabases of sequence but only through a relatively short query \n\nsequence. BLAT, however, looses to BLAST in terms of sensitivity, since it needs an \n\nexact or nearly-exact match to find a hit, making it suitable mostly for closely related \n\nspecies. The alignment identified between 25,261 (sample 2) and 50,816 (sample 1) \n\nprotein features in the contigs, and from 4,859,593 (sample 2) to 10,890,942 (sample \n\n6) in the reads, which proved to be correlated at 98% with the number of dereplicated \n\nreads, using Pearson\u2019s coefficient: \n\n            \n             \n\n                  \n \n\nWhere    and    are the average of the number of dereplicated reads and the number of \n\nprotein features, respectively. \n\nThe results of the search against the M5NR database were retrieved for each of the \n\nsamples, at 90% identity, to map against the metabolic pathways maps based on \n\nKEGG data, using KEGG Mapper[41] [42] and iPath[50] [51]. \n\n\n\nMethods \n\n   \n\n14 \n \n\nBesides from being the input for the Dereplication step, the filtered sequences are pre-\n\nscreened to identify ribosomal sequences at 70% identity, and then they are clustered \n\nusing UCLUST at 97% identity. The clusters are then searched for similarity against the \n\nM5RNA database (Greengenes[52], SILVA[53] and RDP[54]), using BLAT[39]. This \n\nalignment identified between 36 rRNA features (sample 2) to 72 (sample 1) in the \n\ncontigs, whilst in the reads the number ranged from 19,014 (sample 2) to 38,639 \n\n(sample 1). \n\nMG-RAST also calculated automatically the alpha diversity of each sample, to \n\nsummarize the distribution of species-level annotations in that sample, using the \n\nfollowing equation: \n\n                 \n\n \n\n   \n\n        \n\nWhere p is a ratio of the number of annotations for each species to the total number of \n\nannotations and m is the total number of different species annotations, using all the \n\nannotation source databases incorporated by MG-RAST[27]. \n\nBased on the abundances of each species in each sample (using the reads), the R \n\npackage vegan[55] was used to calculate the beta diversity, as suggested in the \n\nmanual[56]. Therefore it was calculated pair wise between samples, using the \n\nS\u00f8rensen index of dissimilarity:  \n\n  \n   \n\n      \n \n\nWhere a is the number of species shared by the two samples, and b and c are the \n\nnumber of unique species to each sample; as well as the widely known Whittaker's \n\nspecies turnover:  \n\n          \n\nWhere ? is the total number of species in the collection of samples (gamma diversity), \n\nand    is the average richness per sample. Subtraction of one guarantees that ?=0 \n\nmeans that there are no excess species or no heterogeneity between samples. \n\nRarefaction curves were also automatically generated. The theory behind it, is to \n\nrepeatedly re-sample the pool of reads, at random, plotting the average number of \n\nspecies represented by 1, 2,\u2026N reads[57].  \n\n\n\nMethods\n\n   \n\n15 \n \n\nKrona[58] was used to view the percentage of reads with predicted proteins and \n\nribosomal RNA genes annotated based on all the databases.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n   \n\n16 \n \n\n \n\n\n\nResults\n\n   \n\n17 \n \n\n3.

Taxonomic Hits Distribution \n\nExtracting the best hit classification from the reads compared to M5NR using a \n\nmaximum e-value of 1e-5, a minimum identity of 90%, and a minimum alignment length \n\nof 15 aa, it is clear that Bacteria, and more specifically Proteobacteria, largely dominate \n\nin all the 7 samples (Figure 6 and Figure 20). \n\nIn terms of class, Betaproteobacteria seems to comprise 78% of Proteobacteria in \n\nSample 1, unlike the other samples, where Gammaproteobacteria seems to be the \n\ndominant class (Figure 7). Sample 3 shows a larger representation of \n\nAlphaproteobacteria compared to the other samples. \n\nMost of Gammaproteobacteria in sample 1 is Pseudoalteromonas, in sample 2 is \n\nPseudomonas, whereas from sample 3 to sample 8 other genera, namely \n\nMarinobacter, become just as dominant (See Figure 21 to Figure 27).   \n\n\n\nResults \n\n   \n\n18 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 6 \u2013 Taxonomic distribution of the reads at the domain level \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7 - Taxonomic distribution of the reads at the class level (Proteobacteria) \n\n \n\nIn terms of ?-diversity, calculated using the reads against all the annotation databases \n\nused by MG-RAST, sample 1 shows the highest: 430.83 species.

As these two environments are \n\nexpected to be very and quite different, respectively, from the deep sea Mariana \n\nTrench samples, this is a good indicator on the reliability of the latter.

Functional Category Hits Distribution  \n\nLooking at the number of features that were annotated based on the reads compared \n\nto the contigs, it is noticeable that the latter provide a much more reliable source for \n\nannotation, as seen from the range of e-values, which was expected. See, for example, \n\nsample 7 in Figure 12 and Figure 13. One might notice that there were more features \n\npredicted from the reads, but at the same time there were more reads than contigs. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 12 - Number of features in the reads of sample 7 annotated by the different databases \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 13 \u2013 Number of features in the contigs of sample 7 annotated by the different databases \n\n \n\nMoreover, taking again sample 7 as an example, only 50.7% of the predicted protein \n\nfeatures in the reads could be annotated with similarity to a protein of known function, \n\nwhereas 84.9% of the predicted protein features of the contigs were annotated. \n\n\n\nResults \n\n   \n\n24 \n \n\nFrom all the databases that were used to compare the protein sequences generated \n\nfrom the contigs, SEED Subsystems[45] had the higher number of annotations. (Figure \n\n12 and Figure 13) It is worth noting, however, that each database has a different type \n\nof annotation data, hence the different number of hits. Since the tools to analyse the \n\npathways (KEGG Mapper and iPath) use the KEGG database, the focus was put on \n\nthe functional hierarchy given by KEGG Orthology (KO)[41][42]. \n\nComparing the reads to KO, using a maximum e-value of 1e-5, a minimum identity of \n\n90%, and a minimum alignment length of 15, on average 53% (\u00b10.03) of the reads with \n\npredicted protein functions were annotated as belonging to the Metabolism category. \n\nFrom those, 14% (\u00b10.05) of the reads belong to Energy metabolism.  \n\nRoughly 100% of the reads from Energy metabolism, in the reads from sample 1, \n\ncorrespond to oxidative phosphorylation, and on the rest of the samples, this value lays \n\naround 77% (\u00b10.07). \n\nIn fact, the F-type H\n+\n-transporting ATPase subunit beta (K02112), involved in both \n\noxidative phosphorylation (Figure 14) and photosynthesis (Figure 15), is the second \n\nmost abundant hit in sample 1 (out of 54 hits), with an average identity of 91.06% and \n\nan average e-value of -6.14. \n\n \n\nFigure 14 - Oxidative Phosphorylation, pathway ko00190.  \n\n \n\n\n\nResults\n\n   \n\n25 \n \n\nIn sample 2, K02112 appears in 11\nth\n place (out of 239 hits) with an abundance of 9187 \n\ntogether with F-type H\n+\n-transporting ATPase subunit alpha (K02111) in 10\n\nth\n place with \n\nan abundance of 9307. \n\nIn sample 3, K02112 has an abundance of 9513 and K02111 of 9758, appearing in 8\nth\n \n\nand 6\nth\n, respectively, when sorting for abundance. For sample 5 the values are 13405 \n\nfor K02112 and 12764 for K02111 (10\nth\n and 12\n\nth\n). Sample 6 has even higher \n\nabundances for K02112 and K02111: 16632 and 16260 (8\nth\n and 9\n\nth\n most abundant). In \n\nsamples 7 and 8 they appear in 5\nth\n and 6\n\nth\n place, out of 108 and 115 hits, with \n\nabundances of 11492 and 11257, and 10691 and 10294. In all samples from the \n\nsecond to the seventh, these subunits have an average identity above 91.5%. \n\n \n\nFigure 15 \u2013 Photosynthesis, pathway ko00195. \n\n \n\nUsing the contigs, with the same settings, only K02112 was found, and only in samples \n\n2 and 8. However, the average alignment length of the hits was 356.55 and 332.22, \n\nrespectively, whereas for the reads it was 27.67 and 27.57. Nevertheless, other hits \n\nalso classified as belonging to Oxidative Phosphorylation were found, like NADH-\n\nquinone oxidoreductase subunit (K13380 and K13378), NADH-quinone oxidoreductase \n\nsubunits (K00338 and K00340), F-type H\n+\n-transporting ATPase subunit c (K02110), V-\n\ntype H\n+\n-transporting ATPase subunits (K02118 and K02122), cytochrome c oxidase \n\n\n\nResults \n\n   \n\n26 \n \n\nassembly protein subunit 17 (K02260), nucleosome-remodeling factor 38 kDa subunit \n\n(K11726), cytochrome o ubiquinol oxidase subunit III (K02299), cytochrome o ubiquinol \n\noxidase operon protein cyoD (K02300) and NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase subunit \n\n5 (K05577).  \n\nTo address, with some degree of confidence, whether alternative energy metabolism \n\nprocesses occur in any of the samples, the contigs results were further explored. \n\nIndeed, all samples contained contigs involved in Methane Metabolism (Figure 16). \n\n \n\nFigure 16 - Methane metabolism, pathway ko00680. In red the enzymes found in the samples. \n\n \n\nIn addition, contigs from samples 2, 5 and 8, matched hits from nitrogen metabolism \n\n(Figure 17). In all the three samples, nitric oxide reductase subunit B (K04561) \n\n(EC:1.7.2.5) was present, which is involved in denitrification (nitrate ? nitrogen). \n\n\n\nResults\n\n   \n\n27 \n \n\nSample 2 also had a nitrogenase iron protein NifH (K02588) (EC:1.18.6.1), a \n\nnitrogenase molybdenum-cofactor synthesis protein NifE (K02587) and a nitrogen \n\nfixation protein NifX (K02596). \n\n \n\nFigure 17 - Nitrogen metabolism, pathway ko00910. In red the enzymes found in samples 2, 5 and 8. \n\n \n\nFinally, the map generated with iPATH (Figure 18) gives a general overview of the \n\npathways present, when combining all samples. It is worth noting that photosynthesis \n\nappears mapped; however, this is most likely a misleading mapping, since the enzyme \n\n\n\nResults \n\n   \n\n28 \n \n\nidentified is an F-type H+-transporting ATPase, which is involved in photosynthesis but \n\nalso in oxidative phosphorylation, as mentioned earlier. \n\n \n\nFigure 18 - Metabolic map of the seven samples \n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n   \n\n29 \n \n\n4. Discussion  \n\nMarine sediments, and in particular hadal trenches, receive substantial deposition of \n\nmicrobes and organic matter from the upper water layer[1], and provide a matrix of \n\ncomplex nutrients and solid surfaces for microbial growth[60]. However, the low \n\ntemperature and the extreme hydrostatic pressure demand a certain degree of \n\nadaptation from the organisms inhabiting such an environment. Even so, there seems \n\nto be a fairly high diversity along the sediment depth, as seen in Table 5 and Figure 9. \n\nProteobacteria is the largest and most metabolically diverse group of Bacteria. They \n\nare all gram-negative, and they divide into 5 classes: alpha, beta, gamma, delta and \n\nepsilon[61]. The dominance of Gammaproteobacteria is in accordance with a study \n\nfrom the Pacific Artic Ocean, where the temperatures are also very low[62], and \n\nsomewhat with the study of sediments at 4000m depth in Pacific Ocean, where not \n\nonly Gammaproteobacteria but also Alphaproteobacteria dominate the community[63]. \n\nIntriguingly, the outer-layer of an actively venting black-smoker chimney from a \n\nhydrothermal vent field on the Juan de Fuca Ridge[64], is also dominated by \n\nGammaproteobacteria, even though its temperature lies above 310\u00baC. \n\nThe PCoA graphs show samples that exhibit similar abundance profiles, in terms of \n\ntaxonomy or function, grouped together. However, when comparing the seven \n\nsamples, there is no obvious trend in the community towards the depth of the sediment \n\n(Figure 10). Nevertheless, the fact that this project\u2019s samples group together and very \n\ndistinctly from other project\u2019s samples, is a good indicator that this environment has its \n\nown community structure.  \n\nThe poor correlation between ?-diversity and distance between samples also supports \n\nthe PCoA results (Table 6 and Figure 28). This means that the difference in microbial \n\ncommunity composition (as defined in [65]) is most likely due to factors other than \n\ndepth. It is possible that, under such high pressure, some centimeters of sediment do \n\nnot really make a difference in the community structure. Alternatively, there might have \n\nbeen some mixing of the communities during the sampling process. \n\nIt should be noted however, that the fact that the community as a whole does not show \n\na shift alongside the depth of the sediment, does not exclude the hypothesis that some \n\ntaxa correlate with it.  \n\nRegarding the decision to assemble, the range of e-values of the number of features \n\nannotated with the different databases, as well as the percentage of predicted protein \n\n\n\nDiscussion \n\n   \n\n30 \n \n\nfeatures that were annotated, should provide some degree of confidence in the \n\nassembly. \n\nThe high number of hits of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway supported the \n\npredictions from [1], that there is intensified O2 consumption within the sediment, unlike \n\nin the sediment of the reference site (?6000m of water depth), where the microbial \n\nactivity has reduced rates. This was supported by measurements of the O2 \n\nconcentration throughout the depth of the sediment. Attenuation in the O2 \n\nconcentration reflects higher rates of its consumption[1] (Figure 19), which is consistent \n\nwith the presence of genes involved in aerobic respiration in all the samples. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 19 \u2013 Oxygen micro-profiles at 6,018?m water depth (a); and at Challenger Deep (b) [1].  \n\n \n\nEven though oxidative phosphorylation dominates the energy metabolism processes, \n\nmethane and nitrogen metabolism still play a part in the community\u2019s energetic \n\npotential.  \n\nNormally, methanogenesis is associated with anoxic environments; still, it is known that \n\neven in oxic environments, anoxic microenvironments can form, where \n\nmethanogenesis takes place[61]. \n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n   \n\n31 \n \n\nOnce more, the predictions that there is intensified mineralization mediated by the \n\nprokaryotic community at Challenger Deep[1] are supported by the contigs with \n\nhomology to features involved in nitrogen metabolism.  \n\nFinally, the misleading mapping of the ATPase (Figure 18), should be taken as an \n\nexample that care and criticism are fundamental when using automated tools. \n\n\n\n \n\n   \n\n32 \n \n\n \n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n   \n\n33 \n \n\n5. Conclusion \n\nThis study was a first description of both the community structure and its functional \n\npotential, in the Mariana Trench, a unique environment for its extreme conditions. The \n\namount of data generated made it prohibitive to describe it in total. The energy \n\nmetabolism was selected for this thesis, since it was interesting to compare with the \n\nresults from [1]. The finding that there are enzymes involved in the oxidative \n\nphosphorylation pathway in all 7 samples, supported the published measurements of \n\noxygen consumption throughout the sediment. \n\nIt was expected to observe a taxonomic and/or functional gradient along the depth of \n\nthe sediment but that does not seem to happen. A further investigation on this matter \n\nwould be helpful to prove if there are any signature taxa of the depth.   \n\nThe data used in the study will soon be publicly available on MG-RAST, therefore \n\naccessible for additional investigation. However, in the future, it would be sensible to \n\nsample with true replicates, and take a broader number of environmental \n\nmeasurements, to allow the data to be more comparable to other studies. It would also \n\nbe interesting to take samples from sediments from other depths along the Challenger \n\nDeep, to assess if the community uniqueness is due to the extreme depth or to the \n\noverall conditions on that site. \n\nTo conclude, it is probable that in 10 years time, with the development of new tools or \n\nwith the improvement of the existing ones, all of these results will be proved inaccurate. \n\nHowever, the aim of this thesis was neither to develop new tools, nor to compare the \n\nexisting ones, but to use them wisely and understand their purpose for this analysis. \n\nHence, the argument of this project is that with this set of tools, this is the product.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n   \n\n34 \n \n\n \n\n\n\nReferences\n\n   \n\n35 \n \n\nReferences \n\n[1] R.
