The developments achieved in \n\nthis area, have significantly contributed for many advances in the field of regenerative \n\nmedicine. This interdisciplinary science combines the knowledge and experience of several \n\ndifferent fields, from materials science to biology, in order to develop synthetic substitutes for \n\nhuman tissues. Aiming at this goal, the most common approach used nowadays involves the \n\nseeding of tridimensional porous structures (scaffolds), biocompatible/biodegradable, with \n\ndonor cells to promote tissue regeneration. This process comprises at least three different \n\nstages: the production of the 3D structures, sterilization and cell seeding into scaffolds, and \n\nfinally the cell culture of the set cell-scaffold. \n\nOn the other hand, dentistry has currently registered an increasing importance, namely in the \n\nendodontic field. Consequently, the development of biocompatible endodontic cements has \n\nbecome of high importance, since these materials can be in direct contact with different cell \n\ntypes, mainly if extrusion of the material to the periapical tissues occurs. There are a variety of \n\ncommercial root canal cements available, based in different formulations, whose \n\nbiocompatibility has been studied in vitro and in vivo over the years. However, all the \n\nendodontic cements commercially available show some degree of cytotoxicity. Thus, new \n\nendodontic cements are emerging, allowing the development of new approaches.  \n\nThroughout this work it was intended to evaluate the cytotoxicity of two different types of \n\nmaterials: scaffolds and endodontic cements, the latter also called filling cements. Thus, the \n\nfirst goal aimed to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxicity of pure PCL scaffolds and PCL-HA \n\ncomposite scaffolds. For this purpose, scaffolds were produced with different percentages of \n\nHA (10% and 25% per weight), and also with different types of HA: synthetic and natural HA \n\n(HA S and HA N, respectively).  Scaffolds were produced by bioextrusion, a technique \n\ncontrolled by a computer, with different architectural characteristics (300 \u00b5m of filament \n\n\n\n \n\nviii \n\n \n\nthickness, 300 and 600 \u00b5m of pore size and geometries of 0/90\u00ba e 0/45\u00ba). The second goal of \n\nthis work aimed to assess the in vitro cytotoxicity regarding three different endodontic \n\ncements: an epoxy-resin, AH Plus JetTM, and two based-silicone cements, GuttaFlow\u00ae2 and an \n\nimproved version of the latter material, that is not yet on the market, and thus it will be called \n\n\u201cimproved\u201d Guttaflow\u00ae throughout this work. In order to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxicity of \n\nthese materials, different volumes of material (0.01, 0.02 and 0.03 mL) and different incubation \n\ntimes (72 and 120 hours) were used. The in vivo cytotoxicity of these materials was also \n\nevaluated in a subcutaneous implantation model. Thus, the endodontic cements were placed \n\ninside tubes with 8 mm of length, obtained by section of 18 GA (1.3 mm ? 48 mm) abocats, \n\nwhich were implanted into three quadrants of the dorsum of Wistar rats. The possible reactions \n\nof the tissues were evaluated 8 and 30 days after implantation. As control, the reactions induced \n\nby abocat tubes without any material inside, were compared during the same time periods (first \n\nquadrant). \n\nThe cytotoxicity assay selected for this work, in order to reach both main goals, was the 3-(4,5-\n\ndimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, which is based upon the \n\nability of the dehydrogenase enzyme (present in metabolically active cells), to cleave the \n\ntetrazolium ring of MTT and convert the yellow water-soluble tetrazolium salt into dark-\n\nblue/purple formazan crystals. In both cases (studies performed with scaffolds and endodontic \n\ncements), the MTT assay was done with macrophages, fibroblasts and co-culture of \n\nmacrophages and fibroblasts.  \n\nRegarding the evaluated scaffolds, it was concluded that PCL-HA N composite scaffolds are \n\nthe ones presenting better in vitro biologic behavior (less cytotoxic). The obtained results also \n\nindicate that the scaffolds\u2019 architecture has a leading role in cell-scaffold interaction. Scaffolds \n\nwith pores of 300 \u00b5m and geometry 0/45\u00ba show less cytotoxicity, which, in the present study, \n\nmeans that they promote a higher cellular adhesion and proliferation. In what concerns the \n\nendodontic cements, the performed in vitro studies allow to conclude that the \u201cimproved\u201d \n\nGuttaFlow\u00ae is the least cytotoxic of the three tested materials, therefore it is the one presenting \n\ngreater biocompatibility.  \n\nKey-words: Biocompatibility, cytotoxicity, tissue engineering, endodontics, scaffolds, \n\nendodontic cements.  \n\n\n\n \n \n\nix \n \n\nResumo \n \n\nA biocompatibilidade descrita como a capacidade de um material para desempenhar uma \n\nresposta apropriada numa determinada aplica\u00e7\u00e3o com o minimo de reac\u00e7\u00f5es al\u00e9rgicas, \n\ninflamat\u00f3rias ou t\u00f3xicas quando em contacto com tecidos, \u00e9 uma das caracter\u00edsticas mais \n\nimportantes dos materiais utilizados em Engenharia de Tecidos e em Medicina Dent\u00e1ria.  \n\nA Engenharia de Tecidos \u00e9 uma \u00e1rea cient\u00edfica em cont\u00ednua expans\u00e3o. Os \n\ndesenvolvimentos conseguidos por esta \u00e1rea t\u00eam contribu\u00eddo significativamente para diversos \n\navan\u00e7os no campo da Medicina Regenerativa, ci\u00eancia que combina conhecimentos de \u00e1reas t\u00e3o \n\ndistintas como a Engenharia de Materiais e a Biologia, com o objectivo de desenvolver substitutos \n\nsint\u00e9ticos para os tecidos humanos. Para se atingir este objectivo, a metodologia mais utilizada \n\nactualmente envolve o uso de estruturas porosas tridimensionais (scaffolds), biocompat\u00edveis e \n\nbiodegrad\u00e1veis, em conjuga\u00e7\u00e3o com c\u00e9lulas, de forma a promover a regenera\u00e7\u00e3o de tecidos. Este \n\nprocesso compreende no m\u00ednimo tr\u00eas fases distintas: a produ\u00e7\u00e3o das estruturas 3D, esteriliza\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\ndeposi\u00e7\u00e3o celular nos scaffolds e por \u00faltimo, cultura celular do conjunto scaffolds-c\u00e9lulas. \n\nPor sua vez, a Medicina Dent\u00e1ria tem registado actualmente uma crescente import\u00e2ncia, \n\nnomeadamente na \u00e1rea de endodoncia. Consequentemente, o desenvolvimento de cimentos de \n\nobtura\u00e7\u00e3o endod\u00f4nticos biocompativeis, tornou-se de extrema import\u00e2ncia, uma vez que estes \n\npoder\u00e3o contactar directamente com diversos tipos de c\u00e9lulas, principalmente se ocorrer extrus\u00e3o \n\ndo material para os tecidos periapicais. Est\u00e3o dispon\u00edveis comercialmente in\u00fameros cimentos de \n\nobtura\u00e7\u00e3o, com diferentes formula\u00e7\u00f5es, cuja biocompatibilidade tem sido estudada in vitro e in \n\nvivo ao longo dos \u00faltimos anos. Contudo, todos os cimentos endod\u00f4nticos dispon\u00edveis \n\ncomercialmente mostram algum n\u00edvel de citotoxicidade. Por este motivo, t\u00eam surgido novos \n\ncimentos de obtura\u00e7\u00e3o, os quais t\u00eam permitido desenvolver novas abordagens.  \n\nNeste sentido, ao longo deste trabalho pretendeu-se avaliar a citotoxicidade de dois tipos \n\ndiferentes de materiais: scaffolds e cimentos endod\u00f4nticos, estes \u00faltimos tamb\u00e9m designados de \n\ncimentos de obtura\u00e7\u00e3o. Assim, o primeiro objectivo deste trabalho pretendia avaliar a \n\ncitotoxicidade in vitro de scaffolds de PCL e scaffolds constitu\u00eddos por PCL/HA. Para tal \n\nfabricaram-se  scaffolds n\u00e3o s\u00f3 com diferentes teores de HA (10% e 25% de HA), mas tamb\u00e9m \n\nabragendo diferentes tipos de  HA: sint\u00e9tica e natural. Os scaffolds foram fabricados pela t\u00e9cnica \n\nde bioextrus\u00e3o controlada por computador, com diferentes caracter\u00edsticas arquitect\u00f3nicas (300 \u00b5m \n\nde espessura do filamento, 300 e 600 \u00b5m de tamanho de poros e geometrias 0/90\u00ba e 0/45\u00ba). O \n\n\n\n \n\nx \n\n \n\nsegundo objectivo deste projecto pretendia avaliar a citotoxicidade in vitro de tr\u00eas diferentes \n\ncimentos de obtura\u00e7\u00e3o: uma resina epoxy, AH Plus JetTM, e dois cimentos tendo por base silicone, \n\nGuttaFlow\u00ae2 e uma vers\u00e3o melhorada deste \u00faltimo  material, o qual por ainda n\u00e3o se encontrar no \n\nmercado, ser\u00e1 ao longo do trabalho designado por \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae.  De modo a avaliar a \n\ncitotoxicidade in vitro destes materiais, utilizaram-se diferentes volumes de material (0,01; 0,02 e \n\n0,03 mL) e tamb\u00e9m diferentes tempos de incuba\u00e7\u00e3o, 72 e 120 horas. Avaliou-se igualmente a \n\ncitotoxicidade in vivo destes materiais em modelos de implanta\u00e7\u00e3o subcut\u00e2nea. Para tal, os \n\ncimentos de obtura\u00e7\u00e3o foram colocados em tubos de 8 mm de comprimento, obtidos por sec\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nabocats 18 GA (1,3 mm ? 48 mm), os quais foram implantados nos quatro quadrantes do dorso de \n\nratos Wistar. Foram avaliadas as poss\u00edveis reac\u00e7\u00f5es dos tecidos aos 8 e 30 dias ap\u00f3s a implanta\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ne comparadas com as reac\u00e7\u00f5es induzidas com tubos de abocat sem material, nos mesmos per\u00edodos \n\n(grupos de controlo).   \n\nO teste de citotoxicidade efectuado in vitro, com vista a atingir ambos os objectivos \n\nreferidos, foi o teste do brometo de 3-(4,5-dimetiltiazol2-il)-2,5-difeniltetraz\u00f3lio (MTT), o qual se \n\nbaseia na capacidade da enzima desidrogenase, presente em c\u00e9lulas metabolicamente activas, \n\nclivar os an\u00e9is tetraz\u00f3lio do MTT e formar cristais formazano de cor violeta. Em ambos os casos \n\n(estudo efectuado com os scaffolds e estudo com os cimentos endod\u00f4nticos), o teste de MTT foi \n\nrealizado com macr\u00f3fagos, fibroblastos e co-cultura de macr\u00f3fagos e fibroblastos.  \n\nNas condi\u00e7\u00f5es deste estudo, relativamente aos scaffolds avaliados, concluiu-se que os \n\nscaffolds constitu\u00eddos por PCL/HA natural s\u00e3o os que apresentam melhor comportamento \n\nbiol\u00f3gico in vitro (menor citotoxicidade). Os resultados obtidos permitiram, ainda, verificar que a \n\narquitectura dos scaffolds desempenha um papel preponderante na interac\u00e7\u00e3o entre as c\u00e9lulas e os \n\nscaffolds. Scaffolds com poros de 300 \u00b5m e geometria 0/45\u00ba mostraram ser menos citot\u00f3xicos, o \n\nque, no presente estudo, significa que promoveram uma maior ades\u00e3o e prolifera\u00e7\u00e3o celular. No \n\nque respeita aos cimentos endod\u00f4nticos, os estudos efectuados in vitro permitiram concluir que o \n\n\u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae \u00e9 o menos citot\u00f3xico dos tr\u00eas materiais avaliados, sendo portanto o que \n\napresenta maior biocompatibilidade.  \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Biocompatibilidade.

An important characteristic of a biomaterial is its \n\nbiocompatibility that can be described as \u201cthe ability to perform with an appropriate host \n\nresponse in a specific application\u201d. Thus, biocompatibility occurs when tissues come in \n\ncontact with a particular material and do not show any toxic, irritating, inflammatory or allergic \n\nexperience, or mutagenic or carcinogenic background. For a material to be biocompatible an \n\nappropriate host response is required, which means non-occurrence of adverse reactions of the \n\norganism face to the material. Therefore, biocompatibility is an essential requirement of \n\nbiomaterials. Another important characteristic of biomaterials is non-cytotoxicity. Cytotoxicity \n\nis the quality of being toxic to cells. If materials are not biocompatible and if they show a \n\ncytotoxic effect, an adverse reaction of the organism and consequently the rejection of the \n\nmaterial by the body can occur.   \n\nThese properties are of utmost importance in many fields, namely in Tissue Engineering and \n\nDentistry.  \n\nTissue Engineering offers the possibility to help in the regeneration of tissues and, in some \n\ncases, to create new tissues and replace failing or malfunctioning organs. This is achieved \n\nthrough the use of degradable biomaterials to either induce surrounding tissue or cell ingrowth \n\nor to serve as temporary scaffold for transplanted cells to attach, grow and maintain \n\ndifferentiate functions. \n\nEndodontics has recently assumed a crescent importance in the panorama of dentistry. The \n\nmain goal of endodontic treatment is the complete tooth restoration, while trying to keep the \n\nnatural tooth when possible. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n2 \n\nThus, the main objective of the present work is to study the cytotoxicity of two different \n\nmaterials: a 3D scaffold composed of poly(?-caprolactone) (PCL) and hydroxyapatite (HA), \n\nthat will be used in Tissue Engineering, and an endodontic sealer whose performance is to be \n\ncompared with similar commercial products. Both, scaffolds and endodontic sealers tested in \n\nthis work have, as final goal, an application in dentistry, specifically, scaffolds in bone tissue \n\nregeneration of the oral cavity (mandible and/or maxillary) and endodontic sealers in \n\nendodontic treatment.   \n\nIn what concerns the tested scaffolds, it is intended to study the influence that the addition of \n\nhydroxyapatite (HA) to poly(?-caprolactone) (PCL) has on their interaction with cells and \n\nconsequently in their cytotoxicity behavior. Thus, in the present work, scaffolds of pure PCL \n\nand also composite scaffolds of PCL-HA were studied.  Additionally, it is intended to test two \n\ndifferent percentages and types of HA, natural and synthetic HA, and to compare their \n\nperformance. Besides that, these scaffolds were fabricated with different architectures, namely \n\npore size and geometry, in order to analyze its influence in scaffolds\u2019 cytotoxicity.  \n\nRegarding the endodontic materials, they should be non-toxic, biocompatible and able to seal \n\ncompletely the root canal system in three dimensions. Among the various types of sealers, the \n\nendodontic cements will be the ones subjected to investigation in the present work. A new \n\ncement (\u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae), not yet on the market, will be compared with two \n\ncommercial products (AH Plus JetTM and GuttaFlow\u00ae2). \n\nThe biological performance of these two distinct materials (scaffolds and endodontic cements) \n\nwill be investigated by in vitro cytotoxicity assays, specifically MTT assays, using \n\nmacrophages, fibroblasts and their co-culture. Besides that, in order to prove the \n\nbiocompatibility of AH Plus JetTM, GuttaFlow\u00ae2 and of the \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae, the in \n\nvivo biocompatibility of these materials, through subcutaneous implants, will also be evaluated.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n3 \n\n1.2  Dissertation structure \n \n\nThe present dissertation is divided in five chapters: \n\n \n\nChapter 1: General introduction \n\nThe present chapter presents a general framework of the work developed along this dissertation, \n\nas well as the summary of the main goals and organization of the dissertation.  \n\n \n\nChapter 2: Literature review  \n\nThis chapter intends to provide the theoretical framework necessary to understand the themes \n\nselected for this dissertation. This chapter is divided in two sub-chapters: in the first one the \n\nconcepts of tissue engineering and the biological strategies that can be applied in tissue \n\nregeneration are described, as well as the biomaterials and technologies used for scaffolds\u2019 \n\nproduction. In the second sub-chapter the dental anatomy, the root canal treatment, and also \n\nthe different types of endodontic materials (specifically cones of gutta-percha and different \n\ntypes of sealers) that can be used in endodontic treatment are addressed. \n\n \n\nChapter 3: Materials and used characterization techniques  \n\nIn this chapter, as the name denotes, the main materials and techniques used in this work are \n\ndescribed. For this purpose, the chapter is divided in three sub-chapters. In the first one, the \n\nmaterials used for scaffolds\u2019 production (PCL and HA) are described, as well as the techniques \n\nused for their production (bioextrusion) and characterization (Thermogravimetric analysis, \n\nHelium pycnometry and low-pressure plasma treatment). In the second sub-chapter the \n\ncomposition and main characteristics of the different endodontic cements, used in this work, \n\nare described. Finally, in the last sub-chapter of this chapter, the cytotoxicity assay that was \n\nused for the study of the biologic behavior of the scaffolds and of the endodontic cements is \n\nreferred. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n4 \n\nChapter 4: Experimental design \n\nThis chapter begins with an introduction where the main goals of this work are described in \n\ndetail. Afterwards, the cell lines used in the in vitro studies (macrophages and fibroblasts) to \n\nachieve the main goals of this work are addressed, as well as cell cultures and the importance \n\nof the in vitro studies. Then, the procedures adopted for the cytotoxicity studies with scaffolds, \n\nwhich were done in order to study the influence of HA addition to PCL and also of pore \n\narchitecture in cell-scaffold interaction, are described. The in vivo and in vitro studies that were \n\ndone to study the cytotoxicity and inflammatory reaction, respectively, of the endodontic \n\ncements used in this work, are also described in this chapter. Finally, the statistical analysis \n\nthat was done in order to analyze the obtained results for both studies (studies with scaffolds \n\nand with endodontic cements) is referred. \n\n \n\nChapter 5: Results and discussion   \n\nThis chapter summarizes the most significant aspects of the present study. For this purpose, \n\nthis chapter is divided in two sub-chapters. In the first one, the results obtained for the in vitro \n\ncytotoxicity studies with scaffolds are described and analyzed. Then, the results obtained with \n\nthe in vitro studies with AH Plus JetTM, GuttaFlow\u00ae2 and with the \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae are \n\nanalyzed.  \n\n \n\nChapter 6: Conclusion and future work   \n\nThis chapter summarizes the most significant features of the present study and perspectives \n\nsome future work.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n  Chapter 2 \n\nLiterature review \n \n\nSince in this work two different materials with different applications will be studied, several \n\nthemes will be addressed in order to facilitate the understanding of the work, in the present \n\nchapter.  \n\nInitially, a literature review on tissue regeneration (TE) based upon the use of scaffolds will \n\nbe done. Special attention will be devoted to scaffolds\u2019 requirements, biomaterials and \n\nproduction, as well as characterization technologies.  \n\nAfterwards, to address the second material in study, an endodontic cement, which is used \n\nin root canal treatment, a literature review on dental anatomy and root canal treatment is \n\npresented. At this point, emphasis will be put on different types of commercially available \n\nendodontic materials.  \n\n \n\n2.1  Scaffolds for tissue engineering  \n\n \n\n2.1.1  Concepts of tissue engineering and its utility  \n\nThe failure of organs and tissues as a result of injury is currently one of the major health \n\nproblems. Treatments encompass, in most cases, transplants, surgical repair, placement of \n\nartificial prosthesis and mechanical devices. However, these procedures often involve the \n\nrisk of immune rejection and require invasive therapies, causing discomfort to the patient, \n\nincreasing time of convalescence and decreasing his quality of life. \n\nIn the last decades, there has been a significant development of some areas of tissue \n\nengineering (TE), aimed to produce biological substitutes able to repair, replace or \n\nregenerate organs and tissues more effectively than conventional therapies [1-2]. \n\nTE comprises three main groups of approach strategies for tissue regeneration [2-5]: \n\n \n\n? the use of isolated cells or cell substitutes. This strategy comprises the direct in vivo \n\nimplantation of isolated cells or cell substitutes. It avoids possible complications associated \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Literature review \n\n \n\n6 \n\nwith surgery. However, there is a possibility of immunological rejection or loss of cell \n\nfunction after implantation; \n\n \n\n? the use of growth factors. The success of this strategy, as the denomination indicates, \n\ndepends on the behavior of growth factors and controlled released systems. Growth factors \n\nare signaling molecules regulating several cellular functions, such as proliferation, \n\ndifferentiation, migration, adhesion and gene expression; \n\n \n\n? the use of scaffolds. This strategy is based on a temporary scaffold which provides \n\nboth a substrate for the implanted cells and a physic support for the formation of new tissue. \n\nThe transplanted cells will adhere to the scaffold, proliferate, secrete their own extracellular \n\nmatrices and stimulate new tissue formation. During this process the scaffold will be \n\ndegrading until it is eliminated by the body.  \n\n \n\nThe last strategy is the most used in TE since it allows the experimental manipulation at \n\nthree different levels: cells, materials and technologies for scaffolds\u2019 production. The cells \n\nused in this strategy are harvested from living tissues removed from the own patient \n\n(autogenic) or from another person (allogenic), deposited in 3D scaffolds and cultured in \n\nvitro in order to obtain a biological implant for transplantation. This strategy can be applied \n\nwith several variations that rely on the origin of the cells, on scaffold\u2019s biomaterial, the \n\nconditions and duration of cell culture, and also on the type and properties of the tissue to \n\nregenerate. \n\n \n\nScaffolds \n\nScaffolds are 3D matrix structures, with high degree of porosity, which act as temporary \n\nsupports for the cells, enabling regeneration of target tissues [1]. They act as a reservoir of \n\nions, water, nutrients, cytokines and growth factors. Therefore, a scaffold can be considered \n\nan artificial substitute of natural extracellular matrix (ECM), as well as of the mineralized \n\nphase, promoting activity, which leads to bone growth, until its regeneration is complete \n\n[4,6-7]. They also support the vascularization of the newly formed tissue. They can actively \n\nparticipate in the regenerative process through the release of growth and/or differentiation \n\nfactors, present in their tridimensional structure [4,6]. Thus, it can be assumed that a scaffold \n\nwith the appropriated properties is an essential component for TE strategies, since its \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Literature review \n\n \n\n7 \n\nproperties affect not only cell survival, signaling, growth, propagation and reorganization, \n\nbut also their gene expression and the preservation (or not) of their phenotype.  \n\nThe criteria that defines a good scaffold for TE include having the adequate materials with \n\nsuitable internal architecture, surface properties and sufficient mechanical properties that \n\nmatch the host tissue, including elastic modulus, compressive strength and fatigue \n\nresistance [1]. The bone biomechanical system is very complex, thus there is not yet a \n\nconsensus on how to produce an ideal scaffold. However, the following properties have \n\nbeen defined has being essential: \n\n \n\n? biocompatibility: one of the primary requirements of any scaffold. The \n\nbiocompatibility of a scaffold is described as its capacity to support normal cellular activity, \n\nincluding molecular signaling without inducing systematic toxic effects to the host tissue \n\nand immunological reactions [5, 8-9]. The implantation of a scaffold can initiate a series of \n\nevents in the organism being an answer to the presence of a foreign body. The typical initial \n\ninflammation can, in some cases, lead to a chronic inflammation, which may promote the \n\ndevelopment of a fibrous capsule and consequent failure of the implant [10]. The degree of \n\nbiocompatibility of a material can be measured by the level of deviation from a normal \n\nprocess of tissue regeneration [11]; \n\n \n\n? osteoinductivity: an ideal scaffold should be osteoconductive, allowing adhesion, \n\ncell proliferation and differentiation in the host tissue [6, 8-9]. The scaffold should induce \n\nbone formation through biomolecular signaling and stem cells recruitment. Moreover, an \n\nideal scaffold need to let form blood vessels around or inside the implant in just a few \n\nweeks of implantation, aiming to help the supply of nutrients, oxygen and removal of waste \n\nproducts [9]; \n\n \n\n? biodegradability: the scaffold material should degrade into biodegradable \n\nmetabolites and be excreted, or reused in tissue remodeling process. The scaffold \n\ndegradation rate should be inversely proportional to the rate of tissue regeneration, in such \n\na way that by the time the injury site is totally regenerated the scaffold is totally degraded \n\n[3,6,8,12];  \n\n? appropriate surface chemistry for cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation: \n\nsince adhesion is a pre-requisite for future cellular functions, the different types of cells \n\nrequire the presence of a suitable substrate to retain their ability to proliferate and perform \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Literature review \n\n \n\n8 \n\ndifferentiated functions [12]. Therefore, the surface characteristics of materials, (such as \n\ntheir topography, chemistry, surface energy and wettability) play a key role in cell adhesion \n\nto biomaterials [14]. Nevertheless, it is very rare that a material with good bulk properties \n\nalso possesses the required surface characteristics. This is why surface modification is \n\nessential for most of the scaffolds used for medical applications [15]; \n\n \n\n? porosity and pore size: porosity is defined as the percentage of empty spaces within \n\na solid body and it is independent of the material [16]. It is necessary for in vivo bone tissue \n\ngrowth to allow migration and proliferation of osteoblasts and mesenchymal cells, as well \n\nas matrix deposition. Generally, the required porosity is around 90% with a pore size \n\nbetween 20 and 250 \u00b5m. Pore size of 20 \u00b5m has been reported for fibroblast ingrowth, from \n\n20 to 125 \u00b5m for regeneration of adult skin and 100-250 \u00b5m for bone regeneration [3]. \n\nRecent studies indicate that a high number of pores, combining micro and macroporous \n\nstructures, allows the improvement of vascularization, comparatively with macroporous \n\nscaffolds, since an interconnected pore network structure enhances the diffusion rates to \n\nand from the center of the scaffold and facilitates vascularization thus improving oxygen \n\nand nutrient supply and waste removal [13]. However, porosity decreases with the \n\nmechanical properties, such as compressive strength, increasing the difficulty of scaffolds \n\nmanufacturing. Small diameter pores are preferable to provide a high surface-volume rate; \n\n \n\n? mechanical and physical properties: scaffolds should have sufficient mechanical \n\nstrength to withstand hydrostatic pressure and tensions in host tissue, enabling a good \n\ncoupling between the scaffold and the host tissue, and allowing cell adhesion and cell \n\nproliferation. The chemical and topographic properties of the surface, can affect cell \n\nadhesion and proliferation. The chemical properties are related with the ability of cells to \n\nadhere to the material, and also with the interaction between proteins and the material. The \n\ntopographic properties are of particular interest regarding the osteoconductive activity \n\n(process through which osteogenic cells migrate to the surface of the scaffold after the \n\nimplantation of the material) [6]. The mechanical properties of bone vary from cancellous \n\nto cortical bone. Young\u2019s modulus of cortical bone is between 15 and 20 GPa, whereas for \n\ncancellous bone is between 0.1 and 2 GPa. Compressive strength varies between 100 and \n\n200 MPa for cortical bone and between 2 and 20 MPa for cancellous bone [9]. \n\nThe wide variation in mechanical properties and pore geometry makes it difficult to design \n\nan ideal bone scaffold.   \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Literature review \n\n \n\n9 \n\nTable 1 shows the relationship between some scaffold characteristics and their \n\ncorresponding biological effects. \n\n \n\nTE strategies based on scaffolds are very dependent on the selected material and of the \n\ntechnological process used for its production. Nowadays, four different classes of materials \n\nhave been used in TE area: polymeric materials of natural origin (e.g. collagen), polymeric \n\nmaterials of synthetic origin (e.g. polyglicolic acid (PGA), polylactide acid (PLA) and \n\npoly(?-caprolactone) (PCL)), metals (e.g. Magnesium) and ceramic materials (e.g. \n\nhydroxyapatite (HA)).  \n\n \n\n2.1.2  Biomaterials for scaffolds production \n\nThe design and fabrication of a porous 3D scaffold represent one of the most important \n\nsteps of TE. In general, the scaffold should be made from a highly biocompatible material \n\nScaffold characteristic Biological effect \n\nBiocompatibility cell viability and tissue response \n\nBiodegradability helps tissue remodelling \n\nPorosity cell migration inside the scaffold \n\ntransport of soluble signaling molecules, nitrogen, oxygen \n\nand metabolic waste removal \n\nvascularization \n\nChemical properties of the \n\nmaterial \n\nhelps in cell attachment and signaling in cell environment \n\nallows release of bioactive substance \n\nMechanical properties affects cell growth and proliferation response \n\nin vivo load bearing capacity \n\nTable1: Relationship between scaffold characteristics and the corresponding biological effects based in [3,7]. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Literature review \n\n \n\n10 \n\nwhich does not have the potential to initiate an immunological or clinically detectable \n\nforeign bone reaction [17].    \n\nOver the last century, there has been a great increase in the use of biomaterials such as \n\nbiocompatible metals, ceramics and polymers for surgical purposes. Metals and ceramics \n\nare mainly use in orthopedics. However, these materials are not biodegradable and their \n\nprocessability is very limited. Thus, polymer materials have received special attention and \n\nhave been widely used in tissue engineering, due to an easy control over biodegradability \n\nand processability [18]. \n\n \n\n2.1.2.1  Metals \n\nMetals, such as stainless steel and titanium, are biocompatible, exhibit high compressive \n\nstrengths, are easy to shape and relatively inexpensive. However, they show some \n\ndisadvantages: they are not biodegradable, they are stiff and there is the possibility of metal \n\nions release [8-9]. Moreover, they have a high Young\u2019s modulus, which induces stress \n\nshielding that can protect the native bone tissue from mechanical stimulation. Mechanical \n\nstimulation is an important initiator of differentiation and activation of osteoblasts. Thence, \n\nmetallic materials are used for scaffolds production in a limited number of situations, for \n\nexample in spine surgery and also to coat the surface of prosthetic implants to promote \n\nbone ingrowth and secondary implant stability [19].  \n\nIn the last years, a biodegradable scaffold material made from magnesium alloys has been \n\ndeveloped. This material allows an increasing of the rate of bone formation and a suitable \n\ndegradation rate. The osteoinductive properties of this material are based on the corrosion \n\nproduct magnesium hydroxide, which can temporarily enhance osteoblast activity and \n\ndecrease the number of osteoclasts [8]. \n\n \n\n2.1.2.2  Ceramics \n\nA ceramic is a material made from an inorganic, non-metallic material with a crystalline \n\nstructure [19]. Ceramic materials have been widely used in biomedical engineering and in \n\nbone regeneration/substitution, mainly due to the ability of being osteoconductive and \n\nosteoinductive. They are mono or poly-crystalline biocompatible materials that show \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Literature review \n\n \n\n11 \n\nstrong chemical bonds among constitutive atoms, correlated with a high hardness and high \n\nmelting temperature. \n\nThe major disadvantages of these materials are brittleness and low mechanical stability [4,6], \n\nwhich prevent their use in situations of regeneration of large bone defects. Moreover, they \n\nare usually difficult to process into porous structures with complex shapes [4]. Furthermore, \n\ndue to in vivo features, like osteoclastic activity, their degradation/ dissolution rates are \n\ndifficult to predict. This could be a problem, since a fast degradation will compromise the \n\nmechanical stability of the system, which is low by itself [6].  \n\nThe most common ceramic material used to build scaffolds is calcium phosphate (CaP). \n\nCaP is an ideal candidate to produce matrices as it mimics the inorganic component of bone \n\n- calcium hydroxyapatite [19]. However, a too fast degradation of scaffolds made from CaP \n\nwould lead to an increase of the extracellular concentration of Ca and P, which can cause \n\ncellular death [6]. Their physical properties including stability, their degradation rate and \n\nprocessability can be modified in a particular range by using different compositions. These \n\nmaterials are known to have an excellent biocompatibility and are bioactive, as they \n\nconnect to bone, allowing an increase of bone tissue formation [8].  \n\n \n\n2.1.2.3  Polymers \n\nPolymeric materials, for TE applications, should be biocompatible, biodegradable and easy \n\nto process. In vivo, polymers degrade mainly due to chemical reactions like hydrolysis. \n\nHowever, some polymers, especially natural polymers and their derivatives, are also \n\nsusceptible to enzymatic degradation. The degradation rate of these materials can be \n\nmodified based upon copolymerization and changes in its hydrophobicity and crystalline \n\nstructure. Degradation reactions are not limited to the material surface, but can also occur \n\nfor some polymers in the whole volume of the scaffold (BULK-degradation), due to the \n\nfast diffusion of water into the material [8].  \n\nThe ideal polymer for TE applications should have the following properties [20-21]: \n\n? should not induce an inflammatory response; \n\n? must be metabolized in the body after finishing its purpose without a trace; \n\n? should be easily processed into the final product form and easily sterilized. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Literature review \n\n \n\n12 \n\nThese materials can be divided in two different types: natural biodegradable polymers \n\nand synthetic biodegradable polymers. Natural polymers are usually biocompatible, \n\nwhereas synthetic polymers can contain a residue of initiators and other impurities that do \n\nnot allow cell adhesion and growth. On the other hand synthetic polymers have better \n\nmechanical properties and thermal stability than several natural polymers [22].  \n\nSome examples of natural polymers are alginate, collagen and chitosan which promote a \n\nhigher cell growth since they have a similar structure to the extracellular matrix of the tissue \n\nto regenerate. However, their regeneration rate cannot be controlled hindering their use.  \n\nAmong synthetic polymers the most frequently used are polyglycolic acid (PGA), \n\npolylactic acid (PLA), and their copolymer PLGA, which obtained approval from the US \n\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use in sutures and some implantable \n\ndevices. The natural polymers are obtained, as their name implies, from natural animal and \n\nvegetal sources, and have as their main advantage a low immunogenic potential, the ability \n\nto interact with the host tissues and a high chemical versatility. Besides, their use in TE is \n\nespecially attractive due to their ability to be remodelled in vivo [8,18].  \n\n \n\n2.1.2.4  Composites \n\nTo overcome the limitations associated to individual biomaterials, the combination of \n\nmaterials with different characteristics has been studied in order to produce scaffolds.  By \n\nselecting the right combination of materials, this strategy allows the adjustment of the \n\nmechanical properties, degradation and absorption rates and biocompatibility of the \n\nproduced scaffolds. The degradation rates of the composites can be optimized by adjusting \n\nthe composition and molecular weights of the polymers, in such a way that the degradation \n\nrate is complementary to the new bone formation rate [23]. \n\nFor bone tissue regeneration, the combination of organic and inorganic materials is \n\nparticularly interesting, since bone is per si a composite material made up of an organic \n\nphase (mainly collagen) and a mineral phase (hydroxyapatite). \n\nIn this work, a composite material based upon the aliphatic polyester PCL and the ceramic \n\nhydroxyapatite has been used to produce the scaffolds. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Literature review \n\n \n\n13 \n\n2.1.3  Technologies for scaffolds production  \n\nThe mechanical, chemical and biological behaviour of scaffolds depend, in a first instance, \n\non the intrinsically properties of the biomaterials used for their production.   \n\nIn recent years, a number of fabrication technologies has been applied to process \n\nbiodegradable and bioresorbable materials into 3D polymeric scaffolds. Nowadays, there \n\nare several techniques to produce scaffolds with different gradients, which can be \n\ncategorized as conventional fabrication techniques or as advanced processing methods \n\n(non-conventional fabrication techniques).  \n\n \n\n2.1.3.1  Conventional Fabrication Techniques \n\nConventional technologies represent the oldest group of techniques used for scaffolds \n\nfabrication. They have been used in a large scale at a global level, with relative success. \n\nThese methods include [3,6,17,20,24-26]: \n\n \n\n? particulate leaching: involves the mix of solid impurities into a polymer solvent \n\nsolution and casting the dispersion to produce a membrane of polymer and salt \n\nparticles. The salt particles are then leached out with water, in order to obtain a \n\nporous membrane;  \n\n \n\n? phase separation: involves dissolving a polymer in a suitable solvent. Then it is \n\nnecessary to place it in a mould, and to cool the mould until the solvent is frozen. \n\nThe micro and macro structure can be controlled varying the quenching temperature, \n\nsolvents and polymer concentration and material;     \n\n \n\n? supercritical fluid-gassing process: involves the use of polymers highly amorphous. \n\nThe polymer granules are plasticized due to the employment of a gas, such as \n\nnitrogen at high pressure. The diffusion and dissolution of the gas into the polymer \n\nmatrix results in a reduction of viscosity; \n\n \n\n? electrospinning: is a technique to produce nano-fibrous scaffolds. Polymers are \n\ndissolved into a proper solvent or melted before being submitted to a very high \n\nvoltage to overcome the surface tension and viscoelastic forces, as well as to form \n\ndifferent fiber diameter (50 nm - 3 ?m). They feature a morphologic similarity to \n\nthe extracellular matrix of natural tissue with effective mechanical properties.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Literature review \n\n \n\n14 \n\nThese processes are easy to implement and allow shape and pore size variations by \n\nchanging the parameters of these techniques. However, the resulting organization of the \n\npores is random, which can lead to pore pathways that are only partially connected. This \n\ncould impair the supply of nutrients and the ingrowth of tissue and vessels into the scaffold. \n\nFurthermore, the existence of a substantial number of closed pores makes the resulting \n\nstructures of these scaffolds fabrication processes as effective as films, allowing the \n\nproliferation in a 2D environment. Nevertheless, they are not suitable to obtain 3D tissues. \n\nBeyond these limitations, conventional techniques often involve the use of organic solvents \n\nthat may be toxic to the cells. Moreover, these techniques usually involve long fabrication \n\ntimes on top of being labour-intensive processes with increased costs [3].  \n\nThe following table (Table 2) summarizes some of the key characteristics and parameters \n\nof these and other conventional techniques currently used.   \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Literature review \n\n \n\n15 \n\nTable 2: Currently applied 3D scaffold fabrication technologies in [17]. \n\nFabrication \ntechnology \n\nProcessing Material properties \nrequired for \nprocessing \n\nAchievable pore \nsize (\u00b5m) \n\nPorosity (%) Architecture \n\n \n\nSolvent casting in \n\ncombination with \n\nparticular leaching  \n\n \n\n \n\nCasting \n\n \n\nSoluble \n\n \n\n30-300 \n\n \n\n20-50 \n\n \n\nSpherical pores, salt \n\nparticles remain in \n\nmatrix \n\n \n\n \n\nMelt moulding \n\n \n\n \n\nMoulding \n\n \n\nThermoplastic \n\n \n\n50-500 \n\n \n\n&lt;80 \n\n \n\n \n\nEmulsion freeze \n\ndrying \n\n \n\nCasting \n\n \n\nSoluble \n\n \n\n&lt;200 \n\n \n\n&lt;97 \n\nHigh volume of inter-\n\nconnected microporous \n\nstructure \n\n \n\nSupercritical-fluid \n\ntechnology \n\n \n\n \n\nCasting \n\n \n\nAmorphous \n\n \n\n&lt;100 \n\n \n\n10-30 \n\nHigh volume of non-\n\ninterconnected \n\nmicroporous structure  \n\n \n\nSupercritical-fluid \n\ntechnology in \n\ncombination with \n\nparticle leaching \n\n \n\n \n\nCasting \n\n \n\nAmorphous \n\n \n\nMicropores &lt;50 \n\nMacropores &lt;400 \n\n \n\n&lt;97 \n\nLow volume of non-\n\ninterconnected \n\nmicroporous structure \n\ncombined with \n\ninterconnected \n\n \n\nFused deposition \n\nmodelling \n\n \n\nSolid free form \n\nfabrication \n\n \n\nThermoplastic \n\n \n\n>150 \n\n \n\n&lt;80 \n\n100% of interconnected \n\nmacroporous structure \n\ndesign and fabrication \n\nlayer by layer.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Literature review \n\n \n\n16 \n\n2.1.3.2  Non-Conventional Fabrication Techniques \n\nLately, the scaffolds production with high geometrical precision has been done using automatic \n\nfabrication technologies [27-28]. The classification of these technologies has undergone many \n\nchanges over time. Initially, they have been classified as technologies of Rapid Prototyping \n\n(RP), but more recently, according to the standards of the American Society for Testing and \n\nMaterials (ASTM), they became classified as technologies of additive manufacturing \n\ntechniques (AM).  \n\nThe basic concept of AM technologies focus on physical reproduction of 3D objects, layer-by-\n\nlayer, from bidimensional data (2D), achieved by the slicing of 3D models created with \n\nsystems of CAD/CAM (CAM \u2013 Computer Aided Manufacturing) [30].   \n\nFigure 1 provides a general overview of the necessary steps to produce RP/AM scaffolds for \n\ntissue engineering.  \n\n \n\nFigure 1: Steps of RP/AM in tissue engineering in [3]. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Literature review \n\n \n\n17 \n\nThe main advantages of AM technologies are the ability to rapidly produce very complex 3D \n\nmodels and to use different materials. These techniques also offer the assurance of \n\nreproducibility, and, due to the additive nature of the process, this also ensure a minimum \n\nwasting of biomaterials, being less expensive. Moreover, when combined with imaging data, \n\nthese fabrication techniques can be used to produce custom implants with an adequate internal \n\nand external geometry, allowing a good coupling between the implant and the native tissue in \n\nthe implantation site [4]. \n\nThese techniques include stereolithographic processes, laser sintering, melt extrusion and three \n\ndimensional printing.  \n\n \n\nStereolithographic processes  \n\nStereolithography (Figure 2) is one of the most important AM technologies currently available. \n\nWith this process 3D solid objects enables the production in a multi-layer procedure through \n\nthe selective photo-initiated cure reaction of a liquid photosensitive polymer [3,30-31]. These \n\nprocesses usually uses two distinct methods of irradiation: mask-based method and direct \n\nwriting process (see Figure 3).  \n\nIn the mask-based method an image is transferred to a liquid polymer by irradiating through a \n\nmask with transparent areas, corresponding to the model section to manufacture. The irradiated \n\npart of the liquid polymer is then solidified [3]. The second method, a direct writing process, \n\nuses a focused UV beam to produce the polymer structure. \n\n \n\nFigure 2: Stereolithography system in [3]. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Literature review \n\n \n\n18 \n\nThe direct writing system consists in a vat containing a photosensitive polymer, a moveable \n\nplatform where the model is built, a laser to irradiate the polymer with UV radiation, and a \n\ndynamic mirror system to direct the laser beam over the polymer surface. After construction \n\nof each layer, the platform dips into the polymer vat containing the polymer, promoting the \n\nproduction of a non-crosslinked polymeric film from which the next layer will be formed [3,31]. \n\nThe next layer is drawn after a wait period to recoat the surface of the previous layer [31].   \n\nThe mask-based method builds models by shinning a flood lamp through a mask, which lets \n\nlight pass through it [3,30-31]. The exposure energy will start the curing process on the exposure \n\narea, forming each cross-section of the 3D physical object [26]. These systems often require \n\nthe generation of a lot of masks, with precise mask alignments. One solution for this problem \n\nis the use of a liquid crystal display (LCD) or a digital projection system as a flexible mask.  \n\n \n\nFigure 3: Writing methods in stereolithography processes. (a) Mask-based method. (b) Direct writing method in [3]. \n\n \n\nThree-dimensional printing \n\nThree-dimensional printing (3DP) has been developed at the Massachusetts Institute of \n\nTechnology (MIT) by Sanchs et al. (1989) [29,32]. This process consists in a homogeneous \n\ndistribution of a powder material layer over the work platform, followed by selective \n\ndeposition of an adhesive material in building zones. After the formation of each layer, a piston \n\nlowers the construction platform, according to the layer thickness, and a new layer of powder \n\ncan be spread over the surface of the previous layer and then selectively joined to it. These \n\nsteps are repeated until the 3D object is completely formed. After finishing the whole process, \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Literature review \n\n \n\n19 \n\na small airflow is used to remove unbound powder that remained in the internal structure of \n\nthe piece [3,29-30,33]. \n\nFigure 4 represent the 3D printing system.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4: 3D printing process, in [3]. \n\n \n\nLaser Sintering \n\nThe process of Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), initially proposed by Deckard, uses a laser \n\nemitting infrared radiation, to selectively heat powder material until reaching a temperature \n\nnear its melting point, Figure 5 [3,30]. \n\n \n\nFigure 5: Selective laser sintering process in [3]. \n\nSLS constructs scaffolds from 3D digital data by sequentially fusing regions on a powder bed, \n\nlayer-by-layer, via a computer controlled scanning laser beam [50]. The laser supplies energy \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Literature review \n\n \n\n20 \n\nthat fuses neighbouring powder particles, and also bonds each new layer to those previously \n\nsintered. After the formation and solidification of each layer, the piston over the model retracts \n\nto a new position and a new layer is supplied using a mechanical roller. The powder that \n\nremains unaffected by the laser acts as a natural support for the model, remaining in place until \n\nthe model is complete [3-4,30]. \n\nSLS allows the construction of scaffolds with complex internal and external geometries. \n\nVirtually any powdered biomaterial that will fuse but not decompose under a laser beam can \n\nbe used to produce scaffolds by this technique [34-35].  \n\n \n\nExtrusion- based processes  \n\nThe extrusion-based rapid prototyping technique, proposed by Crump, is also known as Fused \n\nDeposition Modelling (FDM), Figure 6. Through this process, thin thermoplastic filaments are \n\nmelted and deposited, layer-by-layer, by a robotic device controlled by a computer, to form the \n\nintended 3D object. A coil containing material in a wire form feds the robotic device. The \n\nmelted material leaves the extruder in a liquid form and is deposited in a construction platform \n\nwhere it hardens immediately [3-4,30,36]. The previously formed layer acts as substrate for the \n\nnext layer, and must be maintained at a slightly lower temperature than the solidification \n\ntemperature of the thermoplastic material. This will promote the proper deposition of the next \n\nlayer and enables a good inter-layer adhesion [3,37].  \n\n \n\nFigure 6: Fused deposition modelling process in [3]. \n\nThe major limitations of FDM are due to the use of filament-based materials and the high heat \n\neffect on raw material [37]. Moreover, the phase change phenomena and the processing \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Literature review \n\n \n\n21 \n\nconditions, considered for each application, may induce chemical and physical transformations \n\nof the material. As a consequence, the biocompatibility of the initial material can be altered \n\nduring its fabrication process [38]. In order to solve some of these problems, some alternative \n\nprocesses have been proposed, such as the requirement of precursor filaments or high \n\nprocessing temperatures.   \n\nThe IPL (Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico de Leiria) has developed a variant of the FDM process called \n\nBioExtruder (Figure 7). The scaffolds used in this work were produced by this equipment [3].   \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7: The BioExtruder device in [3]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Literature review \n\n \n\n22 \n\n2.2  Dental anatomy and root canal treatment \n\n \n\nDental anatomy can be defined as the study of the development, morphology, function and \n\nidentity of each of the teeth in the human dentition, as well as the way in which the teeth are \n\nrelated in shape, form, structure, colour and function to the other teeth in the opposite arch \n\n[39].   \n\nIn the human dentition, two sets of teeth erupt during the human lifetime. The first set of teeth \n\nis the primary dentition, which consists of 10 maxillary and 10 mandibular teeth. It normally \n\nbegins to form 14 weeks after conception and usually it is completed around 3 years of age. \n\nThe second set is the permanent dentition which consists of 16 maxillary and 16 mandibular \n\nteeth [39-40]. Scientifically, the permanent human dentition can be expressed by the following \n\nformula: \n\n \n\n? \n2\n\n2\n ? \n\n1\n\n1\n ? \n\n2\n\n2\n? \n\n3\n\n3\n = 16 \n\nin which the denomination of each tooth is represented by the initial letter of its name (e.g., I \n\nfor incisor, C for canine, P for premolar, M for molar), followed by a horizontal line with the \n\nnumber of that kind of teeth in the upper jaw written above the line, and the number in the \n\nlower jaw written below the line [39,41].  \n\nEach tooth is divided into two major parts: the crown and the root. The crown of the tooth is \n\nthe visible part outside of the gums, projecting from the tissues to which the root is fixed. The \n\nroot of the tooth is the portion which normally is not visible in the oral cavity, and is anchored \n\nwithin the bone.  Within each tooth there are four different tissues (Figure 8): enamel, dentine, \n\ncementum (the hardest tissues of a tooth) and pulp, the soft tissue [39-42].  \n\nEnamel forms the outer surface of the crown of the tooth and it is the hardest tissue in the \n\nbody, which allows the tooth to be able to withstand a great amount of stress, pressure and \n\ntemperature changes [39-40,43]. It is formed by ameloblasts [44]. Chemically, enamel is a highly \n\nmineralized crystalline structure with approximately 95% to 98% of inorganic matter by \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Literature review \n\n \n\n23 \n\nweight. The largest mineral present in enamel is hydroxyapatite (HA), which is present in 90% \n\nto 92% by volume. The remaining constituents of the enamel are an organic content of about \n\n1% to 2% and a water content of about 4% by weight [40]. When enamel is formed it does not \n\nhave the ability to grow or repair [43,45]. Structurally, enamel is very brittle, and has a high \n\nelastic modulus and low tensile strength.  \n\nDentin is formed by odontoblasts, which are considered not only part of the dentin but also of \n\nthe pulp. Hence, many authors consider dentin and pulp as a single specialized connective \n\ntissue [41]. Chemically, human dentin consists approximately of 75% of inorganic material, \n\nwhich is composed mainly by HA, 20% of organic material (mainly collagen), and 5% of water \n\nand other remaining materials. It is softer than enamel, but harder than cementum and bone. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8: The four tissues of the teeth. \n\n \n\nCementum is the hardest dental tissue of the teeth covering the roots and is formed by \n\ncementoblasts. Chemically, cementum is composed of approximately 55% of organic material \n\nand 45% of inorganic material, mainly calcium salts. The organic portion is primarily \n\ncomposed of collagen, protein and polysaccharides. Cementum is avascular [40]. \n\nDental pulp is a connective tissue located in the core of the tooth, and is surrounded by dentin. \n\nIt is composed by arteries, nerves, veins, lymph vessels, intercellular substances, macrophages \n\nand odontoblasts, which are able to produce dentin [39-40,43]. The pulp can be divided into two \n\nareas: the pulp chamber, located in the crown of the tooth; and the pulp canal(s), located in the \n\nroot(s) of the tooth [43].  Beyond the formation of dentin, pulp also has other functions: provides \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Literature review \n\n \n\n24 \n\nFigure 9: Main steps of the Root Canal treatment adapted from [50]. \n\nthe sensation to the tooth and responds to irritation by forming a secondary dentin or by \n\nbecoming inflamed [46].  \n\nWhen pulp becomes inflamed or infected a root canal treatment, also known as endodontic \n\ntreatment, is necessary.  During this kind of treatment, the inflamed or infected pulp is removed \n\nand the inside of the root canals are carefully cleaned and disinfected.  After cleaning of the \n\npulp chamber and root canals, the latter are filled with a biocompatible material, with adequate \n\nphysical, chemical and biological properties, to prevent any further infection (Figure 9) [47-49]. \n\nThe filling has three different primary functions: sealing against the penetration of bacteria \n\nfrom the oral cavity, isolation of the remaining microorganisms, and prevention of infiltration \n\nof fluids, that can act as nutrients for bacteria.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Literature review \n\n \n\n25 \n\nIt is possible to say that the success of root canal treatment depends on proper diagnosis, \n\nadequate cleaning and shaping and three-dimensional filling of the root canals to prevent \n\nmicroorganisms from re-entering in the root canal system and cause re-infection [47,51-52]. \n\nThis procedure allows saving the natural tooth, which implies several advantages: it maintains \n\nnatural appearance, protects other teeth from excessive wear or strain, maintains a normal \n\nbiting force and sensation and also an efficient chewing. \n\n \n\n2.2.1  Root Canal Filling Materials \n\nAn ideal root canal filling material should be biocompatible, seal the root canal system in three \n\ndimensions, should not be affected by tissue fluids and should be insoluble in an oral \n\nenvironment [51,53-54]. It also must be nontoxic, radiopaque and easily removed from the canal \n\nif necessary (to enable re-treatment). Furthermore, it should be easily manipulated, have ample \n\nworking time, should not corrode [51,53-54] and must possess ability to allow or induce bone \n\nrepair [49,54]. Some of these materials also have the ability to flow adequately into the canal \n\nirregularities and ramifications of the root canal system, which, together with their \n\nantimicrobial efficacy, aid to eliminate microorganisms from the canal [47].  \n\nThe classic filling technique associates a sealer with a solid core material. The core material \n\nacts as a nucleus for the sealer, and this sealer should fill in the blanks and adhere to the walls \n\nof the dentin. Root canal filling materials can be divided in two different categories: solid core \n\nmaterials (usually gutta-percha cones) and cements/sealers.  \n\n \n\n2.2.1.1  Gutta-percha \n\nGutta-percha is the dried resin of the trees of the family Sapotaceae [55] and has been \n\nuniversally accepted by professionals as the best filling material due to its dimensional stability \n\nand sealing ability. Nowadays, gutta-percha is available in the market in the form of cones \n\n(Figure 10) of a polymer of an organic matrix (latex) or combined with waxes and resins, zinc \n\noxide, calcium carbonate, barium sulphate, strontium sulphate and other components, namely \n\ndyes. In fact, gutta-percha cones contain only approximately 20% of gutta-percha [56]. While \n\npure gutta-percha does not show cytotoxicity effects, cones of gutta-percha show some \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Literature review \n\n \n\n26 \n\ncytotoxicity, which has been attributed to the zinc oxide component, which is released over \n\ntime [57].    \n\nAt room temperature gutta-percha is rigid, becoming \n\npliable at temperatures between 25 and 30 \u00baC, and melting \n\nat 100\u00baC, with partial decomposition [58].  \n\nGutta-percha shows good characteristics such as \n\nradiopacity, biocompatibility and dimensional stability. \n\nHowever, when it is used alone, the cones of gutta-percha \n\ndo not ensure the complete seal of the canals and they also \n\ndo not adhere to the dentin walls [59], reasons why there is \n\nthe need to add a sealer.  \n\n \n\n2.2.1.2  Sealers \n\nEndodontic cements, also called sealers, have been demonstrated to be the essential \n\ncomponents in the formation of a seal during canal filling [60]. They are designed to be used \n\nonly within the root canal system. However during endodontic treatments, sealers sometimes \n\nbecome in contact with periapical tissues. Thus, biocompatibility of the sealers is of great \n\nimportance to clinical success of endodontic treatment [61].  \n\nThe ability of a sealer to flow, during canal filling procedures, reflects its capacity to penetrate \n\ninto small irregularities and ramifications of the root canal system [47]. It is universally \n\naccepted that sealers should be able to fill imperfections and increase adaptation of the root \n\ncanal filling [60-63]. Moreover, sealers act as a lubricant during insertion of the gutta-percha \n\ncones into the radicular system, and allow the filling of spaces where gutta-percha was not able \n\nto adapt [60].  \n\nNowadays, there are many types of endodontic sealers commercially available. To date, they \n\ncan be divided into five different groups: zinc-oxide-eugenol-based cements, calcium \n\nhydroxide cements, glass-ionomers, epoxy resins and silicone-based cements [55,62].  \n\nFigure 10: Gutta-percha cones. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Literature review \n\n \n\n27 \n\nIn the experimental study performed in this work, the cytotoxicity of three different endodontic \n\nmaterials has been studied: one epoxy resin (AH Plus JetTM) and two silicone-based sealers \n\n(GuttaFlow\u00ae 2 and an \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae).  \n\n \n\nZinc-oxide-eugenol-based cements \n\nZinc oxide-eugenol has been used by dentists for many decades as a temporary filling and also \n\nas a cement for endodontic treatments. Eugenol is correlated with phenol, a weak acid, and \n\nboth have shown anaesthetic effects and germicidal activity [97] although biological effects of \n\neugenol vary with concentration. At lower concentrations eugenol may have a beneficial effect, \n\nbut higher concentrations may be cytotoxic (can cause cell death and/or inhibit cell division \n\nand respiration) [59,64]. \n\nWhen eugenol is mixed with zinc oxide, a chelation reaction occurs between the eugenol and \n\nthe zinc ion of the zinc oxide, and a zinc eugenolate is formed [64-65]. This reaction can also \n\noccur between the eugenol and the zinc oxide phase of gutta-percha, which may explain the \n\nincrease in volume of gutta-percha in contact with eugenol. Thus, increasing the proportion of \n\neugenol into the zinc-oxide-eugenol-based cement enhances the volume expansion of the \n\ngutta-percha [65], which can result in a better sealing ability, but increase the risk of undesirable \n\neffects of eugenol. \n\n \n\nCalcium hydroxide cements \n\nThe first clinical use of calcium hydroxide as a root filling material occurred in 1940, by \n\nRhoner. Initially, these sealers were popular for pulp covering and for apexification techniques, \n\nalthough today the two main reasons for its use in endodontic treatment are stimulation of the \n\nperiapical tissues in order to promote regeneration and its anti-microbial effects [66].  \n\nThe therapeutic effect of calcium hydroxide in endodontic treatment is due to its dissolution \n\nwhen in contact with tissue and tissue fluids in the root canals, which leads to a continuous \n\ndissociation of calcium hydroxide in its ions (Ca+ and OH-) [67]. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Literature review \n\n \n\n28 \n\nGlass-ionomers \n\nGlass ionomer cements are a group of materials based on acid/base reaction between \n\npoly(alkenoic) acid and an ion-leachable silicate glass. These materials show a release of \n\nfluoride ions over an extended period of time [68]. \n\nInitially, its use in dentistry was limited by its slow setting time and its lack of strength, \n\nalthough some alterations in the formulations of these materials result in new materials with \n\nproperties that are clinically useful in dentistry. Its biocompatibility with bone and \n\nosteoconductive behaviour are two of those properties. Besides, it exhibits modified working \n\nand setting times, no shrinkage upon setting and high adaptation to the canal walls and \n\nradiopacity [69].  \n\n \n\nEpoxy resins \n\nEpoxy resin are commonly used as root canal filling materials due to their favourable \n\nproperties regarding leakage prevention and biological responses [70]. Within this group of \n\nresins AH Plus is the most successful of the sealers.  \n\n \n\nSilicone-based cements \n\nSilicone has been used in medicine as implant material due to its desirable properties like \n\nbiocompatibility and inertness [71]. Silicone-based materials have been developed as root canal \n\nsealers, showing laboratory and clinical promising data [72]. Silicones show little leakage, and \n\nare virtually non-toxic [73].  \n\nThe most used silicone-based cement is GuttaFlow\u00ae, which was replaced by GuttaFlow\u00ae 2. \n\nGuttaFlow\u00ae 2 is the result of some modifications in the composition of GuttaFlow\u00ae in order to \n\nimprove it, since the presence of silicone in GuttaFlow\u00ae induces poor wetting on the root dentin \n\nsurface. This condition produces high surface tension forces, making the spreading of these \n\nmaterials more difficult.  Another disadvantage of GuttaFlow\u00ae is that it does not adhere \n\nchemically to the dentin [73].\n\n\n\n \n\n   29 \n\nChapter 3  \n\nMaterials and characterization techniques \n \n\nIn this chapter the main materials and techniques used in this work will be described. This \n\nchapter is divided into three main sections. In the first, the materials used for scaffolds \n\nfabrication, specifically PCL and HA, and the techniques used for their production and \n\ncharacterization will be described. In the second section, the compositions of the endodontic \n\ncements tested in this work will be referred, as well as their main characteristics. Finally, in \n\nthe third section, the assay used for cytotoxicity evaluation of both scaffolds and endodontic \n\nsealers will be described. \n\n \n\n3.1  Materials used for scaffolds fabrication and techniques for their \n\nproduction and characterization \n\n \n\n3.1.1  Materials \n\nAs previously referred, the production of scaffolds with adequate biomechanical properties for \n\nTE depends on several factors: materials used, pore geometry and structure interconnectivity. \n\nOver the past few years several studies have been reported based on the use of ceramic and \n\npolymeric materials. For example, biphasic composite materials (organic-inorganic) have the \n\nability to combine the good mechanical strength of polymers with the high compressive \n\nstrength of ceramics. Thus, based in the literature, for this work, composite scaffolds of PCL \n\nand HA were used. HA can be from natural or synthetic origin. Different pore sizes and \n\ngeometries, have been selected in order to analyse their influence in cell adhesion, \n\ndifferentiation and proliferation.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Materials and characterization techniques \n\n \n\n30 \n\nPoly (?-caprolactone)  \n\nPoly(?-caprolactone), an US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved material [17] is \n\none of the most widely diffused biodegradable and non-cytotoxic polymer used as biomaterial \n\nfor the production of scaffolds for TE [1-2]. It is an aliphatic polyester, semi-crystalline, \n\nbiocompatible, with a melting temperature (Tm) between 55 and 60 \u00baC and a glass transition \n\ntemperature (Tg) of ? - 60 \u00baC [28,74]. The molecular structural unit of PCL is composed by five \n\nnon-polar methylene groups and one relatively polar ester group. This structure gives PCL \n\nsome unique properties, such as high processability and high thermal stability (its degradation \n\ntemperature is near to 350\u00baC).  \n\nPCL can be prepared either by ring-opening polymerization of ?-caprolactone (using anionic, \n\ncationic and co-ordination catalysts) or via free radical ring-opening polymerization of 2-\n\nmethylene-1-3-dioxepane, Figure 11 [28]. Ring-opening polymerization can be applied to \n\nproduce high molecular weight polymers, under mild reaction conditions and in shorter time, \n\nopposing to polycondensation, which requires higher temperature and longer reaction times \n\n[75].  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPCL can be degraded by micro-organisms or by a hydrolytic mechanism under physiological \n\nconditions. In some specific situations, cross-linked PCL also can be degraded enzymatically \n\nby surface erosion [2]. Its degradation rate can be modified by the co-polymerization with other \n\nlactones or mix with other polymers [2]. Moreover, PCL has good dissolution in common \n\norganic solvents and its mechanical properties, added to its rate of bioresorption, contributes \n\nfor PCL being one of the most used biomaterials in bone scaffold\u2019s applications [1,8]. \n\nFigure 11: Synthesis of poly(?-caprolactone) by ring-openning polymerization in [20]. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Materials and characterization techniques \n\n \n\n31 \n\nEven though it has a good bioresorption for bone tissue engineering, as well as suitable \n\nmechanical properties [1], PCL shows a lack of bioactivity. Thus, when used in bone TE, the \n\nnew bone tissue cannot bind tightly to the polymer surface [3]. This impairs its use as a scaffold \n\nfor hard tissue regeneration, unless mechanical reinforcement is provided [74]. \n\n \n\nHydroxyapatite (HA) \n\nHydroxyapatite is one of the most attractive materials for hard tissue implants due to its close \n\nresemblance to bones and teeth [75-78]. It is a class of calcium phosphate based bioceramic, \n\nwith high biocompatibility and osteoconductivity [76-79]. HA is not only a biocompatible and \n\nosteoconductive, non-toxic, non-inflammatory and non-immunogenic agent, but also bioactive, \n\ni.e. it has got the ability to form a direct chemical bond with living tissues [76-78,80]. \n\nAdditionally, the chemical similarity with bones and teeth is determinant in apatite deposition \n\nprocess (in vitro and in vivo), protein adsorption and subsequent bone regeneration. Its high \n\nbiocompatibility with hard tissues, skin and muscle contributes to increase its acceptance as an \n\nimplant [76,81]. Moreover, HA ceramics have the ability to induce mesenchymal cells to \n\ndifferentiate into osteoblasts. Therefore, HA is considered a good scaffold material for tissue \n\nengineering [82].  \n\nHowever, despite its inherent bioactivity and its excellent biocompatibility, HA is very brittle, \n\ndifficult to shape and has poor tensile properties [77,79].  \n\nHA can be derived from natural or synthetic sources. The ceramic form of synthetic HA \n\n(Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2), polycrystalline and densely sintered, is considered non-resorbable [83] or \n\nvery little resorbable (1-2% per year) [84]. It has low bioactivity and acts mainly as a bioactive \n\nimplant.  The natural HA is non-stoichiometric (exhibits a Ca/P ratio higher than 1.67) and \n\ncontains carbonate groups (CO3)\n2- instead of groups (PO4)\n\n3- and magnesium and sodium ions \n\n(Mg2+, Na2+) in place of calcium ions (Ca2+) [85-86]. The presence of carbonate groups tends to \n\ndecrease the crystallinity and to augment the solubility of HA, enhancing its biodegradation \n\nrate. Thus, the main difference between the synthetic and natural HA is the carbonate content \n\nwhich is smaller in synthetic HA [87]. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Materials and characterization techniques \n\n \n\n32 \n\nThe natural HA materials have the advantage to maintain the chemical composition and \n\nstructure of the raw materials, from which they were manufactured, such as the pore structure \n\n[85]. Nevertheless, the use of natural HA in TE as substitute can induce the risk of disease \n\ntransmission [44]. One way to reduce this risk is to do a heat treatment, usually at high \n\ntemperatures. However, this can result in a change of composition, particularly by carbonate \n\nloss. This treatment can also induce a modification of the structure due to sintering of crystals, \n\nwith consequent decrease of porosity, which reduces the effectiveness of the material [87].  \n\n \n\n3.1.2  Technology used for scaffolds production: BioExtruder \n\nAs referred in Chapter 2, the scaffolds used in this work were developed at IPL (Instituto \n\nPolit\u00e9cnico de Leiria) using a variant of FDM (fusion deposition modelling) called \n\nBioExtruder  \n\nBioExtruder is a low cost and high reproducible system enabling the fabrication of multi-\n\nmaterial scaffolds, as well as a controlled definition of pores into the scaffold, to modulate \n\nmechanical strength and molecular diffusion [4,37-38].  \n\nThe BioExtruder comprises two different deposition systems: one rotational system for multi-\n\nmaterial deposition and another one for a unimaterial deposition that uses a screw to assist the \n\ndeposition process [Figure 12 (a) and (b)] [38]. The multimaterial deposition system is \n\ncomposed by a rotational structure with four reservoirs, two of which with temperature control \n\nsystem, that are motioned by a pneumatic mechanism. The unimaterial extrusion system is \n\nendowed with a screw that assists in the material deposition. The BioExtruder allows the \n\nutilization of extrusion nozzles with diameters between 0.1 and 1 mm. The deposition code \n\ndeveloped in Matlab (The Math-Works, Inc.) is based on the programming language ISO, \n\nusually used in CNC machines (Computer Numerical Control). \n\nThe information flow chart to produce scaffolds through the unimaterial extrusion system, \n\nwhich will be used in this work involves three main steps: (1) generation of a virtual 3D solid \n\nmodel directly by CAD software, or using data obtained by the imaging techniques (Magnetic \n\nResonance Imaging  or Computer Tomography); (2) conversion of the 3D model to a STL file \n\n(Stereolithographic file), which is the standard file for faceted models (common language for \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Materials and characterization techniques \n\n \n\n33 \n\nall rapid prototyping equipment); (3) mathematical slicing of the STL file into thin layers or \n\nslices (sliced model); (4) each layer or slice is then physically reproduced by the BioExtruder \n\n[3].  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 12: (a) Multi-material extrusion system; (b) Single-material extrusion in [3]. \n\n \n\n3.1.3  Scaffolds characterization \n \n\nThermogravimetry \n\nThermogravimetric analysis or thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) is used as a method to \n\ninvestigate the thermal decomposition of polymers and to assess their relative thermal \n\nstabilities [88]. TGA uses heat to force reactions and physical changes on materials. The sample \n\nis placed in a micro-weighting machine, which is within an oven, to induce the heating \n\nconditions. TGA allows that changes in physical and chemical properties of materials are \n\nmeasured as a function of temperature increase (with a constant heating rate) or as function of \n\ntime (with constant temperature or constant mass loss) [89]. \n\nThe obtained results can be shown as a thermogravimetric curve (TG), in which it is reported \n\nthe mass variation (in percentage) of the sample in function of temperature/time or in the form \n\nof a derivative termogravimetric curve (DTG), where the first curve TG is shown as function \n\nof temperature/time, Figure 13. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Materials and characterization techniques \n\n \n\n34 \n\n \n\nCharacteristic thermogavimetric curves are given for specific materials and chemical \n\ncompounds due to a unique sequence from physicochemical reactions occurring over specific \n\ntemperature ranges and heating rates. This characteristics are related to the molecular structure \n\nof the sample.  \n\nThe weight and the preparation settings of the sample can influence the results obtained. Thus, \n\nsamples with reduced mass and dimensions should be used, to avoid linearity deviation during \n\nheating [91]. \n\n \n\nHelium pycnometer   \n\nHelium pycnometer (Figure 14) is a laboratory device used for measuring the density and \n\nvolume of a wide variety of materials in a simple and accurate manner [92]. The test for \n\npycnometric density of solids is intended to determine the volume occupied by a known mass \n\nof powder. This is achieved by measuring the volume of gas displaced under defined conditions, \n\nsimilarly to the Archimedes method (the volume of liquid displaced by an object completely \n\nimmersed in it, is equal to the volume of the object) [93-94]. \n\nThe basic technique relies on measuring the material volume within the scaffold from a change \n\nin helium pressure, due to the presence of the scaffold in a known volume of gas. Helium is \n\nable to fully penetrate the porous structure of the scaffold without any problem due to surface \n\ntension, since it behaves as an ideal gas and has small atomic dimensions. \n\n       Figure 13: Example of a TG/DTG curve in [90]. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Materials and characterization techniques \n\n \n\n35 \n\n \n\nFigure 14: Schematic diagram of a gas pycnometer in [95]. \n\n \n\nLow-pressure plasma treatment  \n\nPlasma is a simple concept which refers to the fourth chemical state of matter (i.e., in the \n\npresence of sufficient energy, a solid can be melted to a liquid, a liquid vaporized into a gas, \n\nand a gas ionized into plasma). Plasma is a partially ionized gas containing ions, electrons, \n\natoms and neutral species [96].  \n\nPlasma surface modification involves the interaction of the plasma-generated excited species \n\nwith a solid interface [97]. When the plasma comes in contact with the material surface it \n\ntransfers additional energy from the plasma to allow subsequent reactions to take place on the \n\nmaterial surface. The plasma process results in a physical and/or chemical modification of the \n\nfirst few molecular layers of the surface, while maintaining the bulk properties.  \n\nLow-pressure plasma technology is an environmentally friendly and cost-efficient way to \n\nmodify material surfaces, at microscopic level, without manual operations or the use of \n\nchemical products [96]. The process is carried out under vacuum conditions, to enable the gas \n\nto be ionized in a controlled manner. Plasma systems generally comprises five main \n\ncomponents: the vacuum vessel, a pumping group, a gas-introduction and gas-control system, \n\na high-frequency generator and a microprocessor-based system controller [96].  \n\nThe surface modification processes can be divided into four categories: contamination removal, \n\nsurface activation, etch and crosslinking. The surface activation was the used technique in this \n\nwork. Plasma surface modification employs gases such as oxygen and nitrogen, which, when \n\nexposed to the plasma, will dissociate and react with the surface, creating different chemical \n\nVr= reference volume \n\nVc= cell volume \n\nVs= sample volume \n\nM= manometer \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Materials and characterization techniques \n\n \n\n36 \n\nfunctional groups on the surface of the material. The new functional groups have strong \n\nchemical bonds with the bulk material and have the ability to further bond with adhesives to \n\npromote better adhesion. The functional groups also increase the surf adhesive strength [97-98]. \n\nA specially developed plasma activation process can be used to make a substrate surface more \n\nhydrophilic. Gas selection and surface type determine the functional group that will be \n\nsubstituted on the surface.  \n\n \n\n3.1.4  Scaffolds sterilization \n \n\nSterilization is defined as a process that intends to remove or destroy all viable forms of \n\nmicrobial life, including bacterial spores, in order to achieve an acceptable level of sterilization. \n\nThus sterilization implies the inactivation and removal of all forms of life [99]. The efficacy of \n\nany sterilization process will depend on the nature of the product, the extent and type of \n\ncontamination and conditions under which the final product has been prepared. It is expected \n\nthat the sterilization method should not damage or modify the surface/structure of the material.  \n\nBiomedical devices prepared from biodegradable polyesters are usually sterilized by ethylene \n\noxide, since other sterilization procedures, such as irradiation and heat, can cause extensive \n\ndeformation of the devices and accelerated polymer degradation.  \n\n \n\nEthylene oxide sterilization \n\nEthylene oxide (EO) sterilization is a commonly used method for the sterilization of heat-\n\nsensitive materials, such as medical equipment and pharmaceutical products that cannot endure \n\nconventional high temperature steam sterilization, due to the extreme penetrability of EO \n\nmolecule and its compatibility with a wide range of materials [100-101].  \n\nEO sterilization has stood the test of time as a very effective sterilant, being good at killing a \n\nwide range of pathogens and sterilizing the most complex shapes [102]. It was developed in \n\n1940 as a sterilizing agent by the US military, and its use as a medical sterilant dates to the late \n\n50\u2019s. The sterilizing efficiency of EO depends on a series of factors such as the concentration \n\nof the gas, humidity, time of exposure, temperature and the nature of the load [103]. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Materials and characterization techniques \n\n \n\n37 \n\nSterilization via EO exposure begins with the adequate packaging of the scaffolds and their \n\nplacement into a pressurized sterilization chamber. The humidity within the chamber is \n\ncontrolled by the introduction of moisture (40-90% humidity) and the temperature is \n\nmaintained between 40 and 50\u00baC. The EO is then introduced into the chamber at concentrations \n\nranging 600 to 1200 mg.L-1 for sufficient time (between 2-48 h) to achieve the desired SAL \n\n(sterility assurance level). After the sterilization, room air is used to flush the vessel to remove \n\nresidual EO and its toxic byproducts but increases the overall sterilization time.  \n\nChemically, EO reacts with nucleic acids, which contributes to kill microorganisms. Moreover, \n\nEO is an exceptional sterilizing agent due to its bactericidal, sporicidal, and virucidal activity. \n\nThe greatest disadvantage of EO sterilization is the toxicity and carcinogenicity of the residual \n\nbyproducts: ETO, ETC (ethylene chlorohydrin) and ETG (ethylene glycol) [99]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Materials and characterization techniques \n\n \n\n38 \n\n3.2  Endodontic cements and study models used for its in vivo cytotoxicity \n\nevaluation \n\n \n\n3.2.1  Endodontic cements used \n \n\nIn this work, as referred in Chapter 1, three different sealers will be tested: AH Plus JetTM, \n\nwhich is an epoxy-resin composed of amines, and two silicone-based cements GuttaFlow\u00ae2 \n\nand the \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae, that combines gutta-percha in a powder form with a sealer \n\n(polydimethylsiloxane). These sealers are available in self mixing syringes for direct \n\napplication. In this work AH PlusTM, GuttaFlow\u00ae2 and the \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae were \n\nevaluated in order to determine which of these three endodontic cements show lower \n\ncytotoxicity and better biocompatibility. \n\nThe composition and characteristics of the \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae will not be described, since \n\nit is not yet on the market, being still in study (under non-disclosure/confidentiality). \n\n \n\nAH PlusTM \n\n \n\nAH PlusTM is an epoxy-resin whose first formulation was developed more than 50 years ago \n\nin Switzerland [55]. It has been shown to have low solubility and outstanding flow \n\ncharacteristics. AH PlusTM also shows low disintegration, good adhesion and excellent \n\nradiopacity [104]. It is usually used in combination with gutta-percha. However, although it has \n\nadequate long-term dimensional stability, it does not bond to gutta-percha, which is why its \n\nability remains controversial [105]. \n\nNowadays, AH PlusTM is commercially available into two different forms (Figure 15):  \n\n? AH PlusTM in tubes, pastes A and B, for manual mixing; \n\n? AH Plus JetTM in self-mixing syringes for direct intra-oral application, for a \n\nmore appropriated application (easier, quicker and precise). \n\nThe pastes A and B of AH Plus TM have different compositions. Paste A is an epoxy paste and \n\nis composed by bisphenol-A epoxy resin, bisphenol-F epoxy resin, calcium tungsten, \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Materials and characterization techniques \n\n \n\n39 \n\nzirconium oxide, silica and iron oxide particles. While paste B is an amine paste composed by \n\nthree different types of amines, calcium tungsten, zirconium oxide, silicone oils and silica. The \n\ncalcium tungsten, present in the AH Plus JetTM composition, is much used to increase the \n\nradiopacity of the filling materials. \n\nThe form used in this work was the AH Plus JetTM. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 15: AH Plus JetTM and Ah PlusTM in tubes, respectively. \n\n \n\nGuttaFlow\u00ae 2  \n \n\nGuttaFlow\u00ae 2 (Colt\u00e8ne/Whaledent, Langenau, Germany) is a novel silicone-based material for \n\nroot canal filling that combines gutta-percha in a powder form with a particle size of less than \n\n30 \u00b5m and a sealer (polydimethylsiloxane), into an auto-mix syringe (see Figure 16) [106-107].  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 16: Automaxic serynge of GuttaFlow\u00ae2. \n\nIt is the first sealer/gutta-percha combination sealer, flowable at room temperature that can be \n\nused not only as a sealer, but also as an obturating paste without a solid master cone. This \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Materials and characterization techniques \n\n \n\n40 \n\ncombination has as main goal to solve the problems resulting from the formation of interfaces \n\nbetween sealer - gutta-percha cones and sealer \u2013 and internal tooth structure which on setting \n\ncauses shrinkage of sealer and, thus, voids are created resulting in the absence of complete seal. \n\nThe micro-silver in GuttaFlow\u00ae 2 is a metallic silver that is uniformly distributed on the surface \n\nof the filling [106] and which constitutes the antibacterial component, providing an optimum \n\nprotection against re-infection of the root canal. It does not cause corrosion or colour changes \n\nin the GuttaFlow\u00ae [75]. \n\nIt has some characteristics that makes it almost an ideal root filling material, such as good \n\nhomogeneity and adaptation to the root canal walls [81], excellent physical and biological \n\nproperties [107], good biocompatibility [106] and excellent flow properties, which ensure \n\noptimum distribution throughout the root canal. GuttaFlow\u00ae 2 also shows virtually no \n\nsolubility, resulting in a dimensionally stable and impervious root canal filling with great \n\nadhesion to the dentine wall [73].  \n\nDespite all these advantages, a study done by Rana M. et al. [52] compared the results obtained \n\nusing GuttaFlow\u00ae 2 with and without the solid support (gutta-percha cones). The results \n\nshowed that, although GuttaFlow\u00ae 2 without the solid support has good adherence to the dental \n\nwalls and also good physical properties, when combined with a solid support it shows better \n\nresults [52]. In this context, Colt\u00e8ne developed a new material in order to improve the physical \n\nand mechanical properties of GuttaFlow\u00ae 2. The study of the cytotoxicity of this new material \n\n(which will be designed by \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae in this dissertation) is one of the main \n\ngoals of this work. \n\n \n\n3.2.2  In vivo cytotoxicity of endodontic cements and study models \n \n\nThe implantation of endodontic cements in tissues of small size animal models has as it goal \n\nto test the local toxic effect [108]. \n\nBone and connective tissues have been widely used to test the in vivo cytotoxicity and \n\nconsequent biocompatibility of endodontic cements. The materials are introduced in the above \n\nmentioned tissues, using mainly small size animals, such as rabbits and rats. The interface \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Materials and characterization techniques \n\n \n\n41 \n\nmaterial/tissue can be direct or indirect, by inclusion in tubes/supports of different \n\ncompositions [108-109]. \n\nFor bone implantation, the materials are placed in cavities that are prepared for this purpose in \n\nthe mandible, tibia or skull of the animal. For connective tissue implantation, the materials are \n\ninjected or implanted in locas created by surgical dissection in the cellular subcutaneous tissue \n\nor in oral mucosa. Many authors have chosen to use cellular subcutaneous tissue of rats as a \n\nmodel to evaluate the histological response to the implantation of endodontic cements, which \n\ncan be contained in tubes made of several materials or in direct contact with tissues [108]. \n\n \n\nSubcutaneous implantation \n \n\nIn the present work, the histological response of the subcutaneous tissue of the rat to the \n\npresence of AH Plus JetTM, GuttaFlow\u00ae2 and of the \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae is studied. For \n\nthis purpose, the tested materials were inserted in 8 mm tubes (Chapter 4), which latter were \n\nimplanted in locas done by surgical dissection in the cellular subcutaneous tissue.  \n\nThe materials that are implanted adsorb a layer of proteins, which results in a surface \n\nmodification of the implant by them. The aggression that is caused in a vascularized tissue, \n\ndue to the placing of the material, triggers an inflammatory response with immediate release \n\nof active biological substances that induce the migration of blood cells (e.g. neutrophils) to the \n\nreaction site [110]. Toxic materials cause necrosis of the surrounding tissues. Biocompatible \n\nmaterials are not susceptible to phagocytosis by neutrophils. The macrophages, whose \n\nmigration is slower, are the ones that engulf and digest the implant as a foreign body. \n\nMacrophages are unsuccessful, and in order to increase their effectiveness in the engulfment \n\nprocess, they will fuse to form giant cells. However, these cell are incapable of engulfing the \n\nimplant. Thus, the giant cells send chemical signals in order to bring fibroblasts to the implant \n\nsite. This process is often called frustrated phagocytosis. Fibroblasts encapsulate the implant \n\nin a thin, avascular collagenous bursa to isolate it from the body [109-110]. This process is \n\nillustrated in Figure 17.  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Materials and characterization techniques \n\n \n\n42 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHistologic technique \n\nHistology is the study of cellular organization of body tissues and organs. The histologic \n\ntechnique is the operation set that has as its main goal to transform cells and tissues into \n\npreparations for light microscopy. The required steps occur in successive phases according \n\nwith the fundamental principles of the histologic technique. These steps include fixation, \n\ndehydration, embedding in a suitable medium, sectioning into thin slices to enable the \n\nobservation by transillumination, and staining [108-110]. \n\nFixation refers to treatment of the tissue with chemical agents that retard the alterations of \n\ntissue subsequent to death (or after removal from the body) and maintain its normal \n\narchitecture. [110]. This process can be divided into two different phases: (1) the coagulation \n\nor precipitation of several components of the tissue and cells; (2) their preservation in a state \n\nas nearly as possible like the living condition by forming stable chemical compounds [111]. An \n\nideal fixative must penetrate quickly, render all parts of all cells permanent and allow the use \n\nof all kinds of stains. However, since the cell is a highly complex mixture of proteins, \n\ncarbohydrates and lipids, and an ideal fixative would not only have to form stable compounds \n\nFigure 17: A schematic representation of the time course of the foreign body reaction \nto an implanted \u201cbiocompatible\u201d material in [110]. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Materials and characterization techniques \n\n \n\n43 \n\nwith all of these, but also render them insoluble both in lipic solvents and in water, it has not \n\nbeen possible to find an ideal fixative. Some fixatives not only fail to preserve certain parts of \n\nthe cell but actually dissolve or destroy them. For example, acetic acid destroys mitochondria. \n\nMoreover, some fixatives change the shape and relationship of parts of a tissue by shrinkage. \n\nNowadays, the most common fixative agent used in light microscopy is neutral buffered \n\nformaldehyde. It penetrates rapidly, causes little distortion, does not destroy any of the cellular \n\nconstituents and can be followed by almost all staining methods. However, it hardens the \n\ntissues very slowly, and does not protect them from the shrinking agents employed in \n\nembedding and sectioning. For this reason it is often combined with other fixing agents \n\n[109,111-112].  \n\nDehydration is done due the fact that a large fraction of the tissues is composed of water, and \n\nwater and paraffin (the usual embedding medium for light microscopy) do not mix. Thus, this \n\nphase consists in transferring the sample of tissue through a series of alcohol-water solutions \n\nbeginning with 50% or 75% alcohol and progressing in graded steps to 100% alcohol, in order \n\nto remove the water (dehydration). Then, the tissue is treated with xylene. This last process is \n\nknown as clearing, since the tissue becomes transparent in xylene [109,111].  \n\nIn order to distinguish the overlapping cells in a tissue and the extracellular matrix, the tissues \n\nmust be embedded in a proper medium (e.g. paraffin/paraplast) and then sliced into thin \n\nsections. Embedding takes place when the paraffin-infiltrated tissue is placed in fresh paraffin \n\nand the latter allowed to cool. After the blocks of paraffin are trimmed of excess embedding \n\nmaterial, they are mounted for sectioning. Sectioning is accomplished by using a cutting \n\napparatus called a microtome. The microtome will drive a knife across the surface of the \n\nparaffin cube and produce a series of thin sections of very precise thickness. The objective is \n\nto produce a continuous \"ribbon\" of sections adhering to one another by their leading and \n\ntrailing edges. The thickness of the sections can be preset, and a thickness between 5 - 10 ?m \n\nis optimal for observation with a light microscope [109-111]. The sections can then be mounted \n\non glass slides and then stained by water-soluble stains that enable differentiation of the \n\ndifferent cellular components [109,113].  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Materials and characterization techniques \n\n \n\n44 \n\nStaining of histological sections allows observation of features otherwise not distinguishable. \n\nFor routine histological work, it is common to use two dyes, one that stains certain components \n\na bright color and the other, called the counterstain, which stains other cellular structures, a \n\ncontrasting color. The most commonly used stains in histology are hematoxylin and eosin \n\n(H&amp;E). Hematoxylin is a base that preferentially colors the acidic components of the cell a \n\nbluish tint. Since the most acidic components are deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic \n\nacid (RNA), the nucleus and regions of the cytoplasm rich in ribosomes stain dark blue; these \n\ncomponents are referred to as basophilic. Eosin is an acid that dyes the basic components of \n\nthe cell in a pinkish color. As many cytoplasmic constituents have a basic pH, regions of the \n\ncytoplasm stain pink; these elements are said to be acidophilic [109-110]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Materials and characterization techniques \n\n \n\n45 \n\n3.3  In vitro cytotoxicity assay  \n \n\nMeasurement of cell viability and proliferation are the basis for several in vitro assays of a cell \n\npopulation\u2019s response to external factors. The reduction of tetrazolium salts is now widely \n\naccepted as a reliable way to examine cell proliferation and, consequently, the cytotoxicity of \n\nthe materials in study.  \n\nThe MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay is based on \n\nthe ability of the dehydrogenase enzyme, present in metabolically active cells, to cleave the \n\ntetrazolium ring of MTT and consequently convert the yellow water-soluble tetrazolium salt \n\ninto dark-blue/purple formazan crystals insoluble in aqueous solution [10-12]. This reduction \n\nprocess (Figure 18) is associated with the function of dehydrogenases, but may also be due to \n\nthe action of molecules such as NADH and NADPH (reducing equivalents). The amount of \n\nformazan crystals formed is directly proportional to the mitochondrial enzyme activity, i.e. to \n\nthe number of viable cells present [114-116]. After an adequate period of incubation of cells in \n\nthe presence of the MTT solution, the MTT formazan reaction product is only partially soluble \n\nin the medium, thus an alcohol is used to dissolve the formazan and produce a homogenous \n\nsolution, suitable for measurement of optical density [10]. Therefore, by ELISA \n\nspectrophotometry, it is possible to quantify the amount of formed crystals, which is a measure \n\nof metabolic activity. \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 18: Schematic MTT reduction to formazan. This reaction can only occur when the reducing enzymes are active. This \nconversion is, therefore, used to measure cell viability in [115]. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\nChapter 4 \n\nExperimental \n \n\n4.1  Introduction \n\nIn this chapter the procedures used to test the biological performance of the biomaterials, \n\nnamely their cytotoxicity character, will be described in detail.  \n\nRegarding the biofabricated scaffolds, different aspects have been explored. As mentioned \n\nbefore, these scaffolds were produced by an additive biofabrication process, controlled by a \n\ncomputer (bioextrusion) using a mixture of poly(?-caprolactone) and hydroxyapatite. Scaffolds \n\nwith different composition and architectural features have been produced, being one of the \n\naims of this work to study the effects of these properties on the cytotoxicity/cellular interaction. \n\nThe following points have been studied:  \n\n? pore size and geometry: porous matrices can be produced with different structural \n\nparameters by varying pore size and the deposition angle of the filament of the material \n\nduring the layers formation. In the present work samples with two different pore sizes \n\nand angles were used: pore size of 300 and 600 \u00b5m and geometries of 0/45\u00ba and 0/90\u00ba \n\n(Figure 19). In fact, nowadays it is recognized that the microstructure of the scaffolds, \n\nmore specifically the pore dimension and geometry, plays an essential role in cell \n\nadhesion, proliferation and differentiation, as well as in the vascularization process and \n\ntissue growth [6, 44]; \n\n? matrix composition: the scaffolds have been produced of pure PCL and of mixtures \n\nof PCL and hydroxyapatite (HA) in different percentages (10% and 25% of HA by \n\nweight). The idea behind the addition of HA is to improve osteoconduction, bioactivity, \n\nhydrophilicity and mechanical properties of the scaffolds, based on literature data [117]. \n\nIn this work two different types of HA were used, synthetic and natural: HA S and HA \n\nN, respectively. As previously referred HA N differs from HA S since HA N is a poor \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Experimental \n\n \n\n48 \n\ncrystalline apatite and calcium deficient, resulting in alterations of its physical \n\nproperties, which in turn highly affects the development of the cells; \n\n? surface properties: due to the hydrophobic character of PCL, it was decided to modify \n\nthe surface of the scaffolds using plasma technology, in order to improve the scaffolds \n\nhydrophilicity and thus promote a greater interaction between cells and scaffolds. The \n\nsamples with a modified surface by plasma treatment tested in this work were \n\ncomposed of pure PCL and of PCL with 10% of HA S by weight.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nConcerning the endodontic materials, three different samples were tested: an epoxy-resin and \n\ntwo different silicone-based sealers, one of them not yet on the market as referred in Chapter \n\n3. For these samples, besides in vitro cytotoxicity assays, in vivo studies were performed, in \n\norder to evaluate the inflammatory response to these materials.  \n\nThus, this chapter is divided in four main parts. In the first one, the cells used in this work will \n\nbe addressed, as well as the justification for their selection. In the second part the procedures \n\nadopted for the study of the influence of HA and of the scaffolds architecture in cell adhesion \n\nand proliferation will be described. Then, the in vitro and in vivo studies performed with \n\nendodontic materials/cements will be described. Finally, in the last part of this chapter, the \n\nstatistical analysis done in order to analyze the obtained results will be referred.  \n\n  \n\nFigure 29: Scaffolds of PCL produced in the BioExtruder with 300 \u00b5m of pore size. The architectural \norientation of the filaments 0/90\u00ba is shown on the left side and the 0/45\u00ba on the right side. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Experimental \n\n \n\n49 \n\n4.2  Cell lines and cell cultures  \n\nThe toxicity of materials is usually tested using cell cultures, at least in early stages, in order \n\nto decrease the number of in vivo studies. Indeed, tests on cell cultures are simple, fast and \n\neconomical, and allow to test a wide variety of cells and co-culture under the same conditions. \n\nAdditionally, these tests are reproducible and easy to perform. Moreover, in vitro tests have \n\nthe advantage of using a culture medium with standard composition, defined incubation \n\nenvironment and sterile working conditions, enabling precise quantitative and qualitative \n\nassessments. However, the in vitro obtained results cannot be directly extrapolated to clinical \n\nsituations. The importance of conducting in vitro studies is due to the fact that they are a first \n\napproach to analyze the effects of the tested materials and provide preliminary information to \n\nplan with the experimental process. They are intended to determine the biological mechanisms \n\nof action, without interference of other variables to influence results. This is one of the main \n\nreasons why the in vitro design has a fundamental role in the development of such studies, \n\nallowing to decrease the number of the performed in vivo studies (according to the 3R\u2019s \n\nprinciple)1. \n\nSince one of the possible applications of the materials tested in this study is the in vivo maxilla-\n\nmandible-facial implantation, they will be in direct contact with the cells of the connective \n\n                                                 \n\n1 The 3 R\u2019s principle was launched in the early 1960s by two English biologists, Russel and Burch in \ntheir book \u201cThe Principle of Humane Experimental Technique\u201d. The 3 Rs stand for Replacement, \n\nReduction and Refinement. \n\nReplacement: refer to the substitution of conscious living higher animals for insentient material. There \n\nare a number of alternative methods that can be used to replace the use of living animals in either all or \n\npart of a project. Replacement may be relative, when animals are still required to provide cells or tissue, \n\nbut experiments are conducted in vitro: tissue culture, perfused organs, tissue slices, cellular and \n\nsubcelluylar fractions [118].  \n\nReduction alternatives: refer to any strategy that will result in fewer animals being used to obtain \n\nsufficient data to answer the research question, or in maximizing the information obtained per animal \n\nand thus potentially limiting or avoiding the subsequent use of additional animals, without \n\ncompromising animal welfare [119]. \n\nRefinement alternatives: refer to the modification of husbandry or experimental procedures to \n\nminimize pain and distress, and to enhance the welfare of an animal used in science from the time it is \n\nborn until its death [119]. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Experimental \n\n \n\n50 \n\ntissue of the gum. Regarding the endodontic cements, in case of root canal perforation, they \n\nwill be in direct contact with the periapical tissues. In this context it was decided to perform in \n\nvitro studies with human fibroblasts, since they are the major cell constituent of connective \n\ntissue and are found in all areas of the body. Fibroblasts are responsible for the synthesis of \n\nmost components of connective tissue, including collagen, elastic fibers and proteoglycans \n\n[120-122]. They are adherent cells with a flat and elongated shape. Their main function is to \n\nproduce extracellular matrix components (ECM), which consist of glycosaminoglycans, \n\nproteoglycans and fibrous structural proteins such as laminin, fibronectin, elastin and collagens \n\nthat make up the extracellular matrix and maintain tissue architecture. The matrix proteins are \n\nalso involved in wound healing and epithelial repair. Thus, they are used in culture studies as \n\na support layer for cell proliferation.  \n\nThe fibroblasts used in the development of this work are human fibroblasts isolated and \n\ncultured from the dental pulp. These fibroblasts were provided by the Area of Endodontics, \n\nDepartment of Dentistry of Coimbra University2. \n\nBesides human fibroblasts, macrophages were also used in the in vitro studies, since \n\nmacrophages (and their precursors, monocytes) are the \u201cbig eaters/cleaners\u201d of the immune \n\nsystem. They have highly variable morphological characteristics that will depend on their state \n\nof functional activity, and on the tissue where they were found. Macrophages are frequently \n\nused in in vitro studies since they are large, specialized cells that recognize, engulf and destroy \n\ntarget cells/particles/materials. They can change their functional phenotype depending on the \n\nenvironmental cues they receive [123]. Through their ability to clear pathogens and instruct \n\nother immune cells, macrophages have a central role in protecting the host but also contribute \n\nto the pathogenesis of inflammatory and degenerative diseases [124-125]. \n\nThe harvest of human macrophages maintaining the desirable characteristics is very difficult \n\nto achieve and can be a source of possible biological contamination for the user. Rat or mouse \n\nperitoneal macrophages have the same characteristics as human macrophages [126]. Since naive \n\nmacrophages do not divide in vitro by themselves, the Cell Line Companies must modify the \n\n                                                 \n\n2 I want to acknowledge Master Diana Sequeira and Professor Jo\u00e3o Miguel Santos for providing us the \nhuman fibroblasts used in this work. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Experimental \n\n \n\n51 \n\nharvested macrophages from either of these three species. This can be achieved with long \n\nperiods of time of cell culture with exogenous growth factors [Rattus norvegicus alveolar \n\nmacrophages, ATCC\u00ae CRL-2192\u2122] or transformation using virus (e.g. SV40 3  or murine \n\nleukemia virus) [Mus musculus peritoneal macrophages, ATCC\u00ae TIB-186\u2122or ATCC\u00ae \n\nTIB71\u2122] or, if obtained from mononuclear peripheral human blood, they grow as single cells \n\nin suspension [ATCC\u00ae CRL-9855\u2122]. Neither of these hypotheses was viable for this work \n\npurposes or budget. \n\nIn this context, at IBILI, peritoneal macrophages of rats are currently used for in vitro studies \n\nto study the inflammatory response of living tissues, since they play a key role on innate \n\nacquired immune defense. The peritoneal macrophages used in this work were harvested by \n\nthe team from Wistar rats raised at IBILI.  \n\nTo harvest these macrophages, each animal was sacrificed by cervical dislocation (according \n\nto Annex II of the Portuguese Law Decree n\u00ba 113/2013). Then the procedure was done in \n\nanother room with a flow laminar chamber (Holten, HB 2448, verified by IPAC), where UV \n\nlight was previously on during approximately 30 minutes. After this time the UV is switched \n\noff and the flow laminar chamber was cleaned with alcohol at 75%. All the necessary \n\nprocedures were done inside the flow laminar chamber using gloves and sterile material. All \n\nthe enclosed sterile materials entering the flow chamber (syringes, needles and falcons) had \n\nbeen previously disinfected with alcohol at 75%.  \n\nRats were disinfected with alcohol and put inside the chamber in a disinfected container. Then, \n\n20 mL of a Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) [137 mM of NaCl (Sigma, S7653), 2.7 mM of KCl \n\n(Sigma, P9333), 10 mM of NaH2PO4 (Panreac, 1319651211), 1.8 mM of KH2PO4 (Merck, \n\n6580), ultrapure water; pH 7.4] were injected in the peritoneum using a 25G \u00d7 1\u2019\u2019, 0.5 \u00d7 25 \n\nmm, needle ( T Terumos\u00ae Neolus, NN-2525R) and, after an abdominal massage, the liquid \n\nwas harvested with a 1 mL syringe (T Terumos\u00ae, SS+01T1) coupled to a 19G \u00d7 1\u2019\u2019, 1.1 \u00d7 25 \n\nmm, needle ( T Terumos\u00ae Neolus, NN-1925R) (Figure 20). Sterile 15 mL falcon tubes \n\n(Corning\u00ae, 430052) with the recovered cell suspension were kept cooled in crushed ice.  \n\n                                                 \n\n3  Simian vacuolating virus 40, a poliomav\u00edrus. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Experimental \n\n \n\n52 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAfterwards, in a certified cell culture laboratory, the cell suspension previously collected was \n\ncentrifuged during 10 minutes at 1100 rpm and 4\u00baC in a Heracus multifuge centrifuge (1 L-R, \n\ncertified by Certilab). The following procedures were done in a dedicated laminar flow \n\nchamber in sterile conditions. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was re-suspended \n\nadding the complete culture medium RPMI-1640 [Roswell Park Memorial Institute Medium \n\n(Sigma, R8758), 10% of FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Sigma, F7524), 1% L-Glutamine \n\n(Sigma, G7513), 1% antibiotic Penicillin/Streptomycin (Pen/Strep, Sigma, A5955)]. \n\nAs it has been mentioned, all the procedures described in this chapter were carried out in a cell \n\nculture room, in sterile conditions in a laminar flow chamber.  \n\nIn fact, the main goal of cell cultures, the cultivation and propagation of disperse cells, requires \n\nthe establishment of strict aseptic and sterile conditions. \n\nBoth cell lines, peritoneal macrophages and human fibroblasts, are adherent cell lines and both \n\nare maintained at 37\u00baC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in a Binder incubator (06-10960 \n\nverified by Certilab).  \n\nThe peritoneal macrophages were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium and human fibroblasts were \n\npropagated in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium, DMEM (Sigma, D5648) supplemented \n\nwith 15% of FBS; 1% of antibiotic (Pen/Strep) and 1% L-Glutamine. \n\nThe peritoneal macrophages were placed in culture, at first, in 6-well flat bottom microplates \n\n(Costar\u00ae, Corning Incorporation, 3516) with approximately 1 mL of complete RPMI-1640. \n\nThis was done to separate macrophages (adherent cells) from other blood cells harvested \n\nsimultaneously, which are non-adherent. After 24 hours, if there were no experiments to \n\nFigure 20: Injecting 20 mL of PBS (phosphate buffer saline) and harvesting \nmacrophages (1 mL syringe with a 19G needle). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Experimental \n\n \n\n53 \n\nperform, macrophages should be frozen in a -80\u00baC chamber (ThermoScientific, Herafreeze, \n\nHFU TSeries), since they do not divide in vitro. An image of the macrophages and the human \n\nfibroblasts used in this work is represented in Figures 21 and 22, respectively. \n\n \n\nFigures 21 and 22: Microscopic image of macrophages and human fibroblasts, respectively. \n\n \n\nTo detach macrophages from the wells the supernatant was discarded. Then, with gentle \n\ncircular motions the bottom of each well was scraped with a sterile scraper and macrophages \n\nwere collected using approximately 1 mL of complete RPMI-1640 added to the well. After \n\nthat, the suspension was collected with a Gilson pipette, using always sterile tips and inside \n\nthe laminar flow chamber, to a sterile falcon and centrifuged (1100 rpm, 4\u00baC). Inside the \n\nlaminar flow chamber, the supernatant was discarded and a new volume (usually 1 mL) of \n\ncomplete culture medium was added to re-suspend the pellet.  An aliquot of 10 mL of the cell \n\nsuspension was taken to a sterile eppendorf. In order to count the number of viable cells 10 \u00b5L \n\nof Trypan Blue at 4% (Sigma, T8154) were added and the mixture was observed, in a Neubauer \n\nchamber (Marienfeld, 0610030), with an contrast phase optical microscope (Nikon Eclipse, \n\nTS100) coupled to a photo camera (Nikon Coolpix, S400), see Figures 23 and 24. The number \n\nof cells was recorded on the label of the cryopreservation tubes (Sarstedt, 72380992). These \n\ncryopreservation tubes can take up to 1.6 mL. \n\n        \n\nFigure 23 and 24: Neubauer cell chamber in an optical microscope and an example of an image seen in the \nmicroscope during cell counting. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Experimental \n\n \n\n54 \n\nIn order to increase the number of viable cells during cryopreservation, 10% of the volume of \n\nthe suspension placed in each tube of Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma, D2650) was added. \n\nFinally the identified tubes were kept in a dedicated freezer at -80\u00baC. Macrophages were kept \n\nin these conditions until a maximum of 2-3 weeks, and afterwards transferred to a liquid \n\nnitrogen chamber (-190\u00baC) (ThermoNorma, Cryoplus 1). \n\nHuman fibroblasts used in these in vitro studies were cultured in 75 cm2 flasks (Corning\u00ae, \n\n4314640) with complete DMEM 5% (DMEM, 5% of FBS, 1% L-Glutamine, 1% antibiotic \n\nPen/Strep). They had to be transferred from the flasks of 75 cm2, when they reached confluence \n\ninto new flasks by an enzymatic method. Fibroblasts were incubated at 37\u00baC with 3-4 mL of a \n\ntrypsin 0.25 % solution (BioWest, L0930-100), during the necessary time to become detached \n\nfrom the bottom of the flask. About 1 mL of culture medium was added to the flask in order to \n\ninactivate the enzymatic reaction. The cellular suspension was collected to a sterile 15 mL \n\nfalcon tubes and centrifuged as previously referred. Human fibroblasts can also be frozen with \n\na similar protocol, but they need to be kept sooner at -190\u00baC in a liquid nitrogen chamber.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Experimental \n\n \n\n55 \n\n4.3  Tests with scaffolds \n\nThese studies, as previously referred, intend to evaluate the influence of the addition of HA to \n\npure PCL regarding the interaction between cells and scaffolds, and also to evaluate the \n\ninfluence of different types and percentages of HA. Additionally, these studies also intended \n\nto assess the effect of pore size and geometry on the biological properties of the analyzed \n\nscaffolds. Finally, scaffolds whose surface was modified by plasma treatment were also tested. \n\nAll the scaffolds used in this work were produced at IPL (Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico de Leiria) by \n\nqualified people. \n\n \n\n4.3.1  Preparation of PCL-HA mixtures  \n\nFor the development of a scaffold for TE some aspects must be considered, namely the easiness \n\nand flexibility of production, and characteristics like biocompatibility, bioactivity and \n\nosteoconductivity. As discussed before, HA satisfies these requirements. Despite these \n\nfavorable characteristics, the mechanical strength of HA (which is very brittle) and the \n\ndifficulty to manufacture complex structures are some of the main drawbacks of this material. \n\nOn the other hand PCL, being equally biocompatible, fully meet these processing requests. \n\nThus, composite scaffolds of PCL and HA lead, in principle, to an improvement of both \n\nbiological and mechanical properties of the scaffolds. Additionally, it is expected that the \n\nmixture of HA to PCL, besides modulating the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of the composite, \n\nalso improve the adsorption of specific proteins that help to regulate cellular adhesion and \n\nproliferation [127]. Studies involving polymers reinforced with hydroxyapatite showed that the \n\nincorporation of HA in different amounts allows the modulation of the composite elasticity.  \n\nAs also pointed out earlier, the present work aims to compare the biologic performance of \n\nscaffolds produced with two types of HA (synthetic and natural), in the same conditions. For \n\nthe production of composite scaffolds four different PCL-based mixtures were initially \n\nprepared using different types and percentages of HA (synthetic and natural HA with 10% or \n\n25% of HA by weight).  \n\nIn Figure 25 the different scaffolds compositions and the four architectures tested for each one \n\nof the compositions, are summarized.  \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Experimental \n\n \n\n56 \n\nThese mixtures were prepared by melt blending, dispersing the HA particles in a PCL solution. \n\nThe solution preparation consists of the addition of PCL to a solvent mixture of chloroform \n\nand methanol (3:1) with 1% (w/v) of oleic acid, to promote the dispersion. Small portions of \n\nHA were added to this solution, which was heated and in constant agitation through a hot \n\nplate/magnetic stirrer. When the mixture was complete and uniform, it was placed in a plate \n\nfor solvent evaporation during approximately 24 hours. Then, the mixture was placed in \n\nvacuum to eliminate any solvent residue. The solid mixture was fragmented into pellets to \n\nenable its placing into the deposit compartment on the BioExtruder. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe used PCL [CAPA 6500 from Perstorp (UK)] has a molecular mass of 50 000 g/mol. \n\nSynthetic hydroxyapatite with an average particle size of 4 \u00b5m was purchase from Altakitin \n\n(Aveiro, Portugal), while natural hydroxyapatite was obtained thought the calcination of \n\nbovine bones at 600\u00baC. Both natural and synthetic hydroxyapatite had identical average \n\nparticle sizes.  \n\n \n\nFigure 25: Characteristics of tested scaffolds, where HA N and HA S corresponds to natural \nand synthetic HA, respectively. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Experimental \n\n \n\n57 \n\n4.3.2  Scaffolds architectural design  \n\nBesides studying the possible influence that different types and percentages of HA can have in \n\ncell adhesion and proliferation, the present study also intended to evaluate the influence of the \n\nsize and geometry of the pores. Structures with different architectures were prepared to achieve \n\nthis goal: two different pore sizes, 300 and 600 \u00b5m, and two different geometries (deposition \n\nangles), 0/45\u00ba and 0/90\u00ba were used.  \n\n \n\n4.3.3  Scaffolds characterizing techniques \n\nThe produced scaffolds were previously characterized to evaluate their thermal behavior and \n\nporosity as described below.  \n\n \n\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA)4 \n\nThe thermal behavior of the matrices tested was assessed by TGA using a TA Instrument SDT \n\nQ600. From these results it is possible to determine the effective weight percentage of PCL in \n\nthe composite scaffolds, as well the degradation temperature of the polymer. The mass loss of \n\nthe samples as a function of temperature was observed between room temperature and 600\u00baC, \n\nfor each composition. Samples were analysed in triplicate. \n\n \n\nPorosity5 \n\nThe porosity of each scaffold was evaluated using the following methodology: \n\n? the weight of the scaffold was measured; \n\n? the dimensions of the scaffold (with the geometry of a square prism and the stander \n\ndimensions of 2\u00d72\u00d70.1 cm) were rigorously measured  with the help of a ruler \n\n(length and width) and a micrometer (height)  and its volume was calculated; \n\n? the apparent density of the scaffold, ?* , was calculated according to the following \n\nequation: \n\n                                                 \n4,5 These techniques were done by Doutora Patricia Coimbra at the Chemical Engineering Department \n\nof Coimbra University.   \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Experimental \n\n \n\n58 \n\n?? =\n?\n\n?\n, \n\nwhere m represents the mass of the scaffold in grams and V corresponds to the volume of the \n\nscaffold (cm3). \n\nFinally, the porosity was calculated applying the following mathematical equation: \n\n \n\n???????? (%) = (1 ?\n??\n\n?\n) \u00d7 100, \n\n \n\nwhere ? (g/cm3)  is the density of PLC or of the PCL/HA mixture, determined experimentally \n\nin a helium pycnometer ( AccuPyc Pyknometer 1330, micromeritics). \n\n \n\nLow pressure plasma treatment \n\nAlthough PCL has good biocompatibility and structural stability, it demonstrates low surface \n\nenergy, which together with the absence of bioactive functional groups on PCL surface create \n\nan interference with cells affinity and subsequent cellular interaction [128].   \n\nTo enhance bioactive properties of pure PCL scaffolds, surface modification techniques can \n\nbe used. Plasma surface modification is one of these techniques and has the advantage of \n\naltering surface properties without changing the bulk behavior of the scaffolds and is free of \n\nresidual solvents over the scaffold surface [128], as referred in Chapter 3. For plasma treatments, \n\nthe exact control of the process conditions, such as working gas, time of reaction and pressure \n\nin the plasma chamber, allows high surface homogeneity [129].  \n\nFor the plasma surface modification experiments, a laboratory and small-scale production \n\nplasma system FEMTO (low pressure plasma) was used. This equipment was manufactured \n\nby Diener Electronics (Germany), with a stainless steel plasma chamber of 100 mm of diameter \n\nand 270 mm of length [127,129]. The scaffolds were placed in the plasma chamber at ? 80 mm \n\nfrom the electrode and oxygen (O2) was purged into the chamber. The chamber was kept at \n\n400 mTorr through vacuum pump, during 3 minutes. The plasma generated modified the 3D \n\nscaffolds surface. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Experimental \n\n \n\n59 \n\nCytotoxicity assays \n\nFor this study a cell suspension with ? 5 \u00d7 104 cells/mL in culture medium for peritoneal \n\nmacrophages and a cell suspension with ? 1.3 \u00d7 104  cells/mL for human fibroblasts were \n\nnecessary. The scaffolds used for these assays were cut into circular blocks, with 1 mm of \n\nheight and a diameter of 11 mm, to be inserted in 48-well microplates (Costar\u00ae, Corning \n\nIncorporation, 3548). The scaffolds were sterilized by ethylene oxide. \n\nInside the laminar flow chamber, in sterile conditions, the prepared suspensions were \n\ndistributed by the 48-well microplates according to the pre-selected disposition of the scaffolds \n\ndisks, with a final volume of 300 \u00b5L per well.  The suspensions were directly deposited on the \n\nscaffolds in the following way (see Figure 26): \n\n? 150 \u00b5L of the suspension of peritoneal macrophages plus 150 \u00b5L of complete RPMI \n\n10%; \n\n? 150 \u00b5L of the suspension of human fibroblasts plus 150 \u00b5L of complete DMEM 15%; \n\n? 150 \u00b5L of the suspension of peritoneal macrophages plus 150 \u00b5L of the suspension of \n\nhuman fibroblasts; \n\n? wells containing only cells and culture medium, without scaffolds, were used as control \n\ngroups. \n\n \n\nFigure 36: Representation of one of the used 48-well microplates. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Experimental \n\n \n\n60 \n\nFor the case of co-culture, the same suspension of peritoneal macrophages and fibroblasts were \n\nused, leading to a proportion of ? 1 fibroblast per 5 peritoneal macrophages. This proportion \n\nwas used since, as previously mentioned, macrophages do not divide in vitro contrarily to what \n\nhappens with fibroblasts.  \n\nCell proliferation and cytotoxicity were evaluated at 72 hours, for all scaffolds compositions, \n\nin the same conditions, through the MTT assay (Chapter 3).  \n\nTo assess cell proliferation, always in sterile conditions, the culture medium was discarded and \n\n270 \u00b5L of culture medium and 30 \u00b5L of MTT (0.5 mg/mL; Sigma, M2128) were added to each \n\nwell of the assay. After four hours of incubation in the dark, at 37\u00baC, with 5% CO2 and at 95% \n\nrelative humidity, the MTT was aspirated and the blue crystals were solubilized in 300 \u00b5L per \n\nwell of a 0.04M solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl) (Sigma-Aldrich\u00ae, H1758 ) in isopropanol \n\n(Sigma-Aldrich\u00ae, 278475). After 15 minutes, the absorbance was measured with an ELISA \n\nspectrophotometer, using a wavelength of 570 nm and a reference length of 620 nm [130].  \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Experimental \n\n \n\n61 \n\n4.4  Tests with endodontic materials  \n\nAs previously mentioned, the tests with these materials comprise both in vitro and in vivo \n\ntests. \n\n \n\n4.4.1  In vitro cytotoxicity studies  \n\nThese studies have as main goal to determine which of the three tested materials is less \n\ncytotoxic hence more biocompatible. For this purpose, it was decided to study the influence \n\nthat different volumes of the tested materials might have in the cytotoxicity and to compare \n\nthe biologic behavior of the different materials for two lengths of time: 72 and 120 hours. \n\nThese studies have been done with macrophages, fibroblasts and co-culture of macrophages \n\nand fibroblasts. \n\nInitially, it was decided to compare the results obtained with fresh and with frozen \n\nmacrophages in order to confirm if the chosen freezing protocol did not modify the biologic \n\nbehavior (cell-material interaction) of the macrophages.  \n\nTwo different volumes (0.02 mL and 0.03 mL) of AH Plus JetTM, GuttaFlow\u00ae 2 and of the \n\n\u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae were used (see Figure 27). The volume of materials were primarily \n\nplaced in the wells of a 96-well microplate, with the help of a 1 mL syringe with a 21G \u00d7 1\u00bd\u2019\u2019, \n\n0.8 \u00d7 40 mm, needle (T Terumos\u00ae Neolus, NN-2138R), and only then the cells suspensions \n\nwere added to the wells. A cell suspension of 6 \u00d7 104 fresh macrophages/mL and another of \n\n6 \u00d7 104 frozen macrophages/mL were used.  \n\nTo thaw the frozen macrophages, the containing cryopreservation tubes were heated during 1 \n\nto 2 minutes in a water bath at 37\u00baC (Gesellschaft f\u00fcr, 10485789d). Afterwards, inside the flow \n\nlaminar chamber in sterile conditions, cell suspension was transferred to a sterile falcon, adding \n\napproximately 2 mL of complete culture medium, RPMI-1640. This falcon was centrifuged \n\nduring 10 minutes, at 4\u00baC and 1,100 rpm. The supernatant was then removed and the pellet \n\nresulting of the centrifugation was re-suspended in 1 mL of new complete culture medium. \n\nMacrophages harvested and isolated on the day prior to the experiment and cultured during 24 \n\nhours are catalogued as fresh macrophages.  \n\nhttp://www.gfl.de/\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Experimental \n\n \n\n62 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe results obtained in this part of the study demonstrate that the biologic behavior of frozen \n\nmacrophages is similar to the one of the fresh macrophages, as observed in Chapter 5. In this \n\ncontext the following assays were only done with frozen macrophages. Furthermore, the results \n\nof this study also demonstrate that there are not significant differences between the results \n\nobtained with 0.02 and with 0.03 mL of each one of the materials.  \n\nThus, later studies were carried out as previously referred with frozen macrophages, fibroblasts \n\nand co-culture of fibroblasts and frozen macrophages. For the case of co-culture, the proportion \n\nof cells used was ? 1 fibroblast per 10 frozen macrophages (1:10). A cell suspension of 6 \u00d7\n\n103fibroblasts/mL and a cell suspension of 6 \u00d7 104 frozen macrophages/mL was used. The \n\nconcentration of each cell suspension used in co-culture was the same as that used for each \n\ntype of cell per itself.  \n\nIn order to study the influence of the volume of material in the interaction between the referred \n\ncell lines and endodontic materials, two different volumes (0.01 mL and 0.02 mL) of AH Plus \n\nJetTM, GuttaFlow\u00ae 2 and the \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae were used. These volumes of each one \n\nof the materials were placed in different wells of a 96-well microplate (Costar\u00ae, Corning \n\nIncorporation, 3596), according to a pre-selected disposition. Then 150 \u00b5L of each one of the \n\nthree prepared cell suspensions were placed in the different wells of the microplates, being \n\ndirectly deposited on materials, as pre-selected. These volumes of material (0.01 and 0.02 mL) \n\nwere chosen trying to mimic the volumes used for the endodontic procedures. These volumes \n\nFigure 27: Arrangement of the samples in a 96-well microplate, for the study performed with frozen and fresh \nmacrophages for AH Plus JetTM. The wells disposition for GuttaFlow\u00ae 2 and the \u201cimproved\u201d Guttaflow\u00ae, \n\nis the same. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Experimental \n\n \n\n63 \n\nare also chosen because they are the smallest volumes that are possible to measure with a \n\nsyringe with a certain confidence degree, due to the fluidity of the endodontic materials.  \n\nSince GuttaFlow\u00ae 2 and the \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae have Gutta-percha in their composition, \n\nand AH Plus JetTM is always used in combination with a solid support in clinic, it was also \n\ndecided to perform tests with 0.01 and 0.02 mL of AH Plus JetTM in combination with small \n\npieces of Gutta-percha cones, in the presence of frozen macrophages, fibroblasts and their co-\n\nculture.   \n\nIn all the tests that were performed, wells containing only cells and culture medium, without \n\nendodontic materials, were used as control groups. When it was intended to study the behavior \n\nof AH Plus JetTM in combination with small pieces of Gutta-percha cones, wells containing \n\ncells, small pieces of Gutta-percha cones and culture medium were also used as control groups.  \n\nIn Table 3 the different groups that were established during the development of this study are \n\nsummarized. \n\nThe cytotoxicity of the three endodontic sealers tested was evaluated at 72 and 120 hours of \n\nincubation. These times were chosen because, as previously referred, macrophages do not \n\ndivide in vitro, several toxic products are accumulated in the culture medium and cells start to \n\ndie after 120 hours of incubation. \n\nTo assess cell proliferation, the culture medium was discarded and 135 \u00b5L of culture medium \n\nand 15 \u00b5L of MTT (0.5 mg/mL) were added to all wells of the assay. After four hours of \n\nincubation in the dark, at 37\u00baC, in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 95% relative humidity, \n\nthe MTT was removed and the purple bluish crystals were solubilized in 150 \u00b5L per well of a \n\n0.04 M solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl) in isopropanol. After 15 minutes, the absorbance \n\nwas measured with an ELISA spectrophotometer, using a wavelength of 570 nm and a \n\nreference standard of 620 nm [130].  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Experimental \n\n \n\n64 \n\nTable 3: Experimental groups for the in vitro study of cytotoxicity of the endodontic materials. \n\nExperimental groups \n\nControl \n\nincubated with the adequate \n\nculture medium (complete RPMI \n\n1640 at 10% for macrophages and \n\ncomplete DMEM at 15% for \n\nfibroblasts) \n\n? fresh macrophages; \n\n? frozen macrophages  \n\n? fibroblasts  \n\n? co-culture of frozen macrophages and fibroblasts; \n\n? frozen macrophages with small pieces of Gutta-percha;  \n\n? fibroblasts with small pieces of Gutta-percha; \n\n? co-culture of fibroblasts and frozen macrophages with \n\nsmall pieces of Gutta-percha; \n\nFresh macrophages \n\nincubated with complete RPMI \n\n1640 at 10% during 72h \n\n? with 0.02 and 0.03 mL of AH Plus JetTM; \n\n? with 0.02 and 0.03 mL of GuttaFlow\u00ae2; \n\n? with 0.02 and 0.03 mL of the \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae; \n\nFrozen macrophages \n\nincubated with complete RPMI \n\n1640 at 10% during 72h \n\n? with 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03 mL of AH Plus JetTM; \n\n? with 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03 mL of GuttaFlow\u00ae2; \n\n? with 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03 mL of the \u201cimproved\u201d \n\nGuttaFlow\u00ae; \n\n? with small pieces of Gutta-percha; \n\nFrozen macrophages  \n\nincubated with complete RPMI \n\n1640 at 10% during 120h \n\n? with 0.01 and 0.02 mL of AH Plus JetTM; \n\n? with 0.01 and 0.02 mL of GuttaFlow\u00ae2; \n\n? with 0.01 and 0.02 mL of the \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae; \n\nFibroblasts \n\nincubated with complete DMEM \n\n15% during 72h \n\n? with 0.01 and 0.02 mL of AH Plus JetTM; \n\n? with 0.01 and 0.02 mL of GuttaFlow\u00ae2; \n\n? with 0.01 and 0.02 mL of the \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae; \n\n? with small pieces of Gutta-percha; \n\nCo-culture of frozen \n\nmacrophages and fibroblasts \n\nincubated with complete DMEM at \n\n15% during 72h \n\n? with 0.01 and 0.02 mL of AH Plus JetTM; \n\n? with 0.01 and 0.02 mL of GuttaFlow\u00ae2; \n\n? with 0.01 and 0.02 mL of the \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae; \n\n? with small pieces of Gutta-percha; \n\n  \n\nIn Figure 28 it is possible to see an image of a 96-well microplates, used in this study.

Heat loss is reduced by a thick fur cover \n\nand a layer of subcutaneous fat. In addition they are cost \u201ceffective\u201d and easy to house, feed, \n\nbreed and manipulate. \n\nDuring these studies, some humanitarian critical limits have been taken into account as, for \n\nexample, discomfort signs or severe pain, weight loss higher than 15% of the initial weight, \n\nrespiratory difficulties and posture and motor activity changes [131].    \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Experimental \n\n \n\n66 \n\nExperimental protocol \n\nFor the in vivo assays 20 Wistar rats, adult females, were used with weights ranging between \n\n120 and 260 grams.  \n\nThe study comprised two different time periods, 8 and 30 days. The inflammatory response of \n\nthe following materials was studied:  AH Plus JetTM, GuttaFlow\u00ae 2 and the \u201cimproved\u201d \n\nGuttaFlow\u00ae. The ultimate goal is to compare the behavior of the latter, not yet marketed, with \n\nthe first two already available. \n\nThe evaluation was assessed by routine histological study, using optical microscopy. All the \n\nmaterials were implanted in all the animals, in distinct points of subcutaneous cellular tissue \n\nas described later (page 67).  \n\n  \n\nAnesthesia \n\nA combination of Ketamine 50 mg (Ketalar\u00ae, Cetamina Pfizer, 8276907) and chlorpromazine \n\n5mg/mL (Largactil\u00ae, Laborat\u00f3rios Vit\u00f3ria, 9977827) (3:10) i.m. was used. This combination \n\nwas administrated in the thigh, via intramuscular (i.m.), with a dosage of 0.3 mL per 100 g of \n\nbody weight. \n\n \n\nPreparation of the chirurgic site and materials implantation \n\nTrichotomy of the involved areas in the intervention was done, in 4 dorsum quadrants, at level \n\nof right and left scapular and right and left pelvic regions (Figure 29). The animal was \n\npositioned in ventral decubitus. Then, the disinfection of the trichotomized areas was carried \n\nout with a dermal solution of iodine polyvidone (Egrema, Paracelsia, 0670). The surgical \n\nprocedure was performed inside a laminar flow chamber, and all surgical equipment \n\n(scalpel+blade 11, scissors, tweezers, needle holder, sutures) was sterile. The skin incisions (4 \n\nper animal) were done in a selected point of each quadrant, and a loca was created by blunt \n\ndissection of the subcutaneous cellular tissue. The studied materials were placed inside 18 GA, \n\n1.3 mm \u00d7  48 mm, abocath tubes (BD InsyteTM, 381247) with 8 mm long just prior to \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Experimental \n\n \n\n67 \n\nimplantation. This procedure was done in sterile conditions in another flow laminar chamber, \n\nusing gloves and sterile material.  \n\nThe materials were implanted in all the animals as represented in Figure 29: \n\n \n\nFigure 29: Anatomical localization of the implantation of the studied materials. \n\n \n\nThe interventions were finalized with closure of operatory wounds, using non-resorbable \n\nsuture material, silk 4/0. All enclosures of used materials were previously disinfected with \n\nalcohol at 75% before going inside the laminar flow chamber. \n\n \n\nPost-operatory and control along time  \n\nAt the end of surgery the animal was harmed up and monitored until awaking. Animals were \n\nkept in cages (an animal per cage), inside a temperature, light and in &amp; out air flow controlled \n\ncabinet (Tecniplast, 9ARMI/4120). Animals were provided with proper food and water ad \n\nlibitum, and bedding was changed once or twice a week, as needed. Animals were checked \n\ndaily and weighted (Seca, model 734, serie 1/1) once a week. \n\n \n\nEuthanasia  \n\nAt the end of each period (8 and 30 days), animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation \n\naccording to the procedure described in Annex II of the Portuguese Law Decree n\u00ba 113/2013, \n\nAugust, 7th.  \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Experimental \n\n \n\n68 \n\nNecropsy and harvests \n\nThe weight of the animals was registered every 8 days. They were placed in ventral decubitus \n\nover an absorbent material. The location of the implants was searched by tactile sensitivity and \n\ntrichotomy of the areas was re-done. Then the chirurgic removal of the implants was done (see \n\nFigure 30), with a wide safety margin of surrounding tissue.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe collected materials were photographed and immediately fixed in pre-identified laboratory \n\ncassettes (see Figure 31) for Anatomical Pathology routine processing by immersion in \n\nbuffered formaldehyde at 10% (Sigma, 252549) (usually a volume 40 times larger than the \n\nsamples). Containers were placed at 4\u00baC for at least 48 hours. Routine processing was \n\nperformed [109] for inclusion in paraplast (Sigma, P3568) and further histologic studies. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 30: Chirurgic removal of the implant. \n\nFigure 41: Expellant with a wide margin of surrounding tissue. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Experimental \n\n \n\n69 \n\nHistology \n\nSamples were prepared for the histological study at the Laboratory of Experimental Pathology \n\nof the Dentistry Department of the Medicine Faculty of the University of Coimbra.  \n\nIn what concerns the histological preparation of the implants with surrounding tissue, they \n\nwere fixed by immersion in neutral buffered formaldehyde at 10% (as referred in the previously \n\ntopic). Following fixation, each tissue sample has been placed in an alcohol water solution, \n\nbeginning with 60% alcohol and progressing in graded steps to 100% alcohol, in order to \n\nremove the water content. Then, the alcohol was replaced by xylene (Sigma-Aldrich, 534056), \n\nand in a next step xylene was replaced by paraplast (Sigma, P3568) (overnight at 56\u00baC). The \n\nsamples were included in paraplast to make blocks, using a dedicated equipment. Finally, the \n\ntissue blocks were cut into thin sections (5 ?m of thickness), using a microtome (Leica RM \n\n2155, Leica, Portugal) with disposable knives. The sections were, then, mounted on individual \n\nmicroscope slides (previously coated with a liquid adhesive and dried), using a black \n\nbackground water bath at 37\u00baC. Afterwards, the microscope slides were placed in a store tray, \n\nin order to dry in incubator at 37\u00baC.  \n\nThe hematoxylin and eosin routine histologic coloring technique has been done in order to \n\nenable optical microscopy observation. Since the dyes are aqueous, the paraplast was removed \n\nwith several steps of xylene, followed by a grading sequence of alcohols (from absolute ethanol \n\nto 60%). The sections were washed with tap water and were finally stained with Aldrich \n\nhematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich, MHS1). Dye excess was removed with tap water and \n\ncounterstaining was done with eosin (Sigma-Aldrich, HT110280) [109]. In order to obtain long \n\nlasting preparations, the sections have to be protected with a glass coverslip. The mounting \n\nmedia are not water soluble, hence the removal of water with an upgrading sequence of alcohol \n\nbaths and xylene. After drying over night at room temperature or in the incubator at 37\u00baC for \n\na short period of time, sections were ready to be observed with an optical microscope and to \n\nobtain digital photos using a dedicated computer program. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Experimental \n\n \n\n70 \n\n4.5  Statistical analysis  \n\nIn order to study the scaffolds, Kruskal-Wallis test was applied with adjusted pairwise \n\ncomparisons to evaluate possible differences in MTT values due to different types and \n\npercentages of HA and different architectures (pore geometry and size). All the \u201cp values\u201d \n\nwere obtained using the software IBM\u00ae SPSS\u00ae Statistic, version 22 (IBM Corporation, \n\nArmonk, New York, EUA). \n\nIn order to analyze the influence of the different parameters under study two different softwares \n\nwere used. Initially MiniTab, (version 18), was used, however, as this software is normally \n\nonly adequate when there are a large volume of data, the software Statistic Data Mining, \n\nversion 10.0 (Dell Software) was used to try to confirm the previously obtained results with \n\nMiniTab.    \n\nRegarding the analysis of the cytotoxicity data of endodontic sealers, all the analysis were done \n\nwith SPSS, applying the Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney test.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n71 \n\nChapter 5 \n \n\nResults and discussion \n \n\nAs referred in Chapter 4, this work has two main objectives: \n\ni) assessing the biological performance/cytotoxicity of scaffolds for tissue \n\nregeneration; \n\nii) assessing the cytotoxicity of three different endodontic cements in order to study \n\nthe behavior of a new endodontic material in comparison with two other materials \n\nalready on the market.  \n\nBoth studies have been done using macrophages, fibroblasts and their co-culture.  \n\nIn what concerns the first objective, the results analysis is done in order to evaluate the \n\ninfluence that scaffolds\u2019 architecture and composition have in cell adhesion and proliferation. \n\nIt is important to note that the higher the cell adhesion and proliferation the smaller the \n\ncytotoxicity of the scaffolds is.  \n\nThe aim of the analysis of the results of the second goal consists on assessing the in vitro \n\ncytotoxic effect of the three endodontic materials tested in this work (AH Plus JetTM, \n\nGuttaFlow\u00ae 2 and an \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae), in order to evaluate the cytotoxic behavior of \n\nthe new endodontic cement, the \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae. \n\n \n\n5.1  In vitro studies with scaffolds \n\nIn the literature, there are several references to the use of some biodegradable synthetic \n\npolymers in the field of biomedical engineering as they are ease to process, and due their \n\nmechanical and physical properties, low toxicity, low immunogenicity and low risk of \n\ninfections.  \n\nThe most widely used synthetic polymer is PCL (polycaprolactone), which is a linear aliphatic \n\npolyester, hydrophobic, biocompatible and biodegradable, with a melting temperature of            \n\n? 60\u00baC. It also has high processability and high thermal stability. However, despite all these \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Results and discussion \n\n \n\n72 \n\nadvantages, the use of PCL in scaffolds\u2019 fabrication is limited due to its hydrophobic character. \n\nThus, in this field, PCL has been used in the preparation of composites based on ceramic \n\nmaterials, in order to improve the mechanical strength, osteocompatibility/osteoconductivity \n\nand implant degradation rate. \n\nSince the requirement of scaffolds can vary according to the cell type, it is necessary to ensure \n\nthat the design and the production of porous structures are sufficiently flexible to accommodate \n\nand promote the growth of specific cell lines. Besides, the cell colonization process of scaffolds \n\nis highly dependent on the ability that cells have to build bridges between the pores and to \n\nmigrate into the interior of scaffolds. It is known that a scaffold with an interconnected pore \n\nstructure with appropriate pore size and distribution should facilitate the attachment and the \n\nproliferation of cells necessary for a complete tissue regeneration.  \n\nIn order to evaluate all these factors, it was programmed to study the influence that different \n\npercentages (10 and 25%) and different types of HA - natural HA (HA N) and synthetic HA \n\n(HA S) - have in cell adhesion and proliferation within scaffolds. Two different cell lines, \n\nmacrophages and fibroblasts, and their co-culture have been selected. Furthermore, the \n\nscaffolds that were used also had different architectures trying to evaluate the influence that \n\nthe pore size and geometry might have in the interaction between cells and scaffolds (Figures \n\n32-34).  \n\nIn Figures 32-34 the obtained results for each one of the studied cells are represented.  \n\nThrough the analysis of the results in these figures it is possible to see a clear influence of the \n\npore architecture in the obtained results. The higher the intensity in the microplate reader, \n\nwhich is shown in the y-axis of the graphs, the higher is the number of living cells within the \n\nscaffolds. The obtained results suggest an increased number of metabolically active cells for \n\npores of 300 \u00b5m and a geometry of 0/45\u00ba compared to the 0/90\u00ba one. Only for two of the \n\nanalyzed compositions (HA S 25% 600 \u00b5m and HA N 10% 300 \u00b5m) better results were \n\nobtained with a geometry of 0/90\u00ba.  \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Results and discussion \n\n \n\n73 \n\n \n\nFigure 32: Representation of the fibroblasts response in function of the architecture of the scaffolds. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 33: Representation of the macrophages response in function of the scaffolds architecture. \n\n \n\nUsing SPSS (IBM, version 2.2) it was possible to confirm these conclusions, since the obtained \n\nresults show statistically significant differences (p<0.01) for the pore size (300 vs 600 \u00b5m) and \n\nalso for the geometry (0/45\u00ba vs 0/90\u00ba). The fact that cells prefer pores of 300 \u00b5m can be \n\ncorrelated with a better reproduction of what happens in vivo. The effective distance between \n\ncells and blood vessels in vivo are of the order of the 200-250 \u00b5m. In the literature a pore size \n\naround of 150-500 \u00b5m has been reported to facilitate vascularization and enable a good \n\npenetration of cells to promote the growth of new tissue [3,13] \n\n0\n\n0,5\n\n1\n\n1,5\n\n2\n\n2,5\n\ncontrol 300 \u00b5m 0/45\u00ba 300 \u00b5m 0/90\u00ba 600 \u00b5m 0/45\u00ba 600 \u00b5m 0/90\u00ba\n\nA\nv\ne\nra\n\ng\ne\n o\n\nf \nM\n\nT\nT\n v\n\na\nlu\n\ne\ns\n\nArchitecture\n\nFibroblasts response in function of the \narchitecture of the scaffolds \n\nPCL HA S 10% HA S 25% HA N 10% HA N 25% control\n\n0\n\n0,5\n\n1\n\n1,5\n\n2\n\n2,5\n\ncontrol 300 \u00b5m 0/45\u00ba 300 \u00b5m 0/90\u00ba 600 \u00b5m 0/45\u00ba 600 \u00b5m 0/90\u00ba\n\nA\nv\ne\nra\n\ng\ne\n o\n\nf \nM\n\nT\nT\n v\n\na\nlu\n\ne\ns\n\nArchitecture\n\nMacrophages response in function of scaffolds \narchitecture\n\nPCL HA S 10% HA S 25% HA N 10% HA N 25% control\n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Results and discussion \n\n \n\n74 \n\n \n\nFigure 34: Representation of the co-culture response in function of the scaffolds architecture. \n\n \n\nObserving the results in Table 4, regarding the scaffolds\u2019 porosity, based on gravimetric \n\nmeasurements, the architecture 300 \u00b5m 0/45\u00ba is the one presenting the lowest porosity values. \n\nHowever, these results do not clarify if cells migrate to the interior of the scaffolds or if they \n\nmainly adhere to the surface.

Moreover, PCL has low \n\nbioactivity, which limits the ability of the structures to recruit cells from surrounding tissues \n\n(when implanted in vivo), as well as the ability to promote cell adhesion, proliferation and \n\ndifferentiation in vitro. The superior biocompatibility of the PCL/HA scaffolds may result from \n\nthe gradual dissolution of the incorporated HA particles into calcium and phosphate ions, \n\nwhich can help to regulate the behavior of the nearby cells.   \n\nComparing the results obtained for each one of the cell types for each composition and \n\narchitecture of the scaffolds, it can be observed that in most cases the higher values of MTT \n\nwere obtained for fibroblasts. A possible justification could be the fact that fibroblasts are cells \n\nlarger than macrophages, therefore occupying a larger surface area than the latter. In the case \n\nof co-culture, the presence of fibroblasts can difficult the adhesion of macrophages, even \n\nthough care has been taken to seed macrophages immediately prior to fibroblasts. Furthermore, \n\nin contrast to fibroblasts, macrophages do not divide in vitro. This last factor was, however, \n\ntaken into consideration during the experimental assay, having been used (as mentioned in \n\npage 60) a proportion of 1 fibroblast per 5 macrophages.  \n\nIn order to investigate the impact and the magnitude of each factor in cellular response (MTT \n\nvalue) and the interaction between these factors, the experiments using scaffolds with HA were \n\ncarried out following a design of experiments (DOE) of factorial type. DOE is a test, or series \n\nof tests, where intentional changes are made to the variables of a process in order to measure \n\nthe responses of the process. The main goal of the DOE encompasses determining which \n\nvariables have more influence on the response of the process. There are several types of DOE\u2019s, \n\nthe one chosen for this analysis was the 24 design with four replicas per point. This means that \n\nthere are four independent variables (factors) \u2013 pore, geometry, percentage of HA (HA %) and \n\ntype of HA \u2013 studied at two levels, designated by low and high, and each point of the design \n\nhas four replicas.  \n\nTable 5 shows the parameters used in DOE. The design layout, generated by the software \n\nminiTab is presented in appendix 1.    \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Results and discussion \n\n \n\n76 \n\nTable 5: Representation of the factors that were used for the DOE. \n\nFactor Name Type \nLevels \n\nLow (-1) High (+1) \n\nA HA Type categorical S N \n\nB HA (%) numerical 10 25 \n\nC Pore (\u00b5m) numerical 300 600 \n\nD Geometry categorical 0/45\u00ba 0/90\u00ba \n\n \n\nBased on the DOE it was possible to adjust the results to a linear model (appendix 1) and to \n\ngenerate several graphs including Pareto Charts, Figures 35 to 37. In these graphs all the \n\neffects that exceed the line corresponding to a 2.01 value, are statistically significant. Thus, it \n\ncan be seen that, regardless of the cell type used in this assay, the C factor (pore size) is the \n\nfactor that most influences the obtained MTT values. The effect of C is about 5 to 10 times \n\nhigher than the effect of the other factors. Although the MTT values for the percentage of HA \n\nand pore geometry are also significant, they had lower effects comparatively to the pore size \n\nfactor. In this assay, the C factor (pore size) is the factor that most influences the obtained MTT \n\nvalues. Between the factors B and D, the most significant is factor D. Regarding the A factor \n\n(type of HA), it seems that it is the least significant of the four analyzed factors, being \n\nnegligible for macrophages. The Pareto Charts obtained for each one of the studied cells types \n\nare represented in Figures 35 to 37. \n\nBased on these results, it is possible to conclude that the scaffolds architecture, C and D factors, \n\nhas more influence than the others analyzed factors, on the interaction between cells and \n\nscaffolds, which can be seen in the following three figures (Figures 35 to 37). This is in \n\naccordance with what was concluded based on previous results, and with what is reported in \n\nthe literature, since the scaffolds colonization process is highly dependent on the ability of cells \n\nto build bridges between the pores. If the pore size is not adequate (too big or too small) cells \n\nwill not have the ability to migrate and colonize the scaffolds in a homogeneous way.  \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Results and discussion \n\n \n\n77 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 37: Pareto Chart for the case of co-culture. \n\n             \n\nAs previously seen, the addition of HA to PCL significantly improves the MTT values, but this \n\nanalysis also reveals that, being present, the type (synthetic HA or natural HA) and the \n\npercentage in which it is present (10% or 25%) have little influence on the results. However, \n\nthis does not mean that the HA type is not important to the interaction of the scaffolds with \n\nother cells like osteoblasts, as well as for in vivo studies. Perhaps in these cases the effects of \n\nthis factor will be statistically significant, but relying on the performed studies no conclusions \n\ncan be drawn. The same can be concluded about the percentage of HA in the scaffolds, which \n\nsurely will have a great influence on the mechanical properties and in the rate of in vivo \n\ndegradation.  \n\nFigures 35 and 36: Pareto Chart for the results obtained with macrophages and fibroblasts, respectively, where:  \nA represents the type of HA, B the percentage of HA, C the size of the pores in \u00b5m and D the pore \ngeometry (0/45\u00ba or 0/90\u00ba). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Results and discussion \n\n \n\n78 \n\nThe effect of the interactions between factors are also significant, thought their influence when \n\ncompared with the effect of factor C is also small.  \n\nThe analysis using SPSS and miniTab led to the same conclusions.  \n\nFigures 38 to 40 represent the main effects in the MTT values and their degree of influence. \n\nThese figures confirm what was previously said about the influence of the factors. Observing \n\nthe Figures 38-40 it is clear that the factors C and D (pore and geometry, respectively) are the \n\nfactors that most influence the obtained results. By the slope of the line it is possible to see the \n\ninfluence that the different variables have in the MTT values. For example, the slope of the \n\nfirst graph on the Figures 38-40 is very small and positive, which indicates that HA N provides \n\na slightly better interaction between cells and scaffolds (better MTT results), compared with \n\nHA S, but this difference is very small. In fact, the Pareto Charts indicate that this difference \n\nis not statistically significant both for fibroblasts and macrophages.  \n\nConcerning the percentage of HA, the increase from 10% to 25% results in a small increase of \n\nthe MTT values. The results obtained regarding the pore and geometry are in accordance with \n\nthe  previous conclusions. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 38: Main effects that influence interactions between fibroblasts and scaffolds. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 39: Main effects that influence interactions between macrophages and scaffolds. \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Results and discussion \n\n \n\n79 \n\n \n\nFigure 40: Main effects that influence cellular interactions with scaffolds for the co-culture. \n\n \n\nAs it is possible to see in the Pareto Charts in Figures 35 to 37, the interaction between factors \n\nalso has significant effects in the results, although their influence is less significant than the \n\none of C factor. Figures 38 to 40 represent the influence of each one of the interactions that \n\noccurred during the experiments. For example, observing the graph relative to the interaction \n\nbetween factors A and B (type and percentage of HA) - (first graph of Figures 38 to 40), and \n\nconsidering the combined results for macrophages, fibroblasts and their co-culture, it can be \n\nobserved that the percentage of HA has a positive effect in the MTT values, being more \n\nsignificant (therefore having a greater effect) for HA S than for HA N. Analyzing the graphs \n\nof the Figures 35 to 37, it can be seen that only the interaction BD (interaction between the \n\npercentage of HA and the geometry) is always statistically significant, and that the effect of \n\nthe geometry is more significant for the percentage of 10% of HA than for 25%.  \n\nIn order to try to understand the interactions, the software Statistic (version 10.0) was used, \n\nallowing to evaluate the interaction between the four factors in study.  \n\nAs it can be seen in the graphs of Figures 41 and 42, the percentage of HA for the geometry of \n\n0/45\u00ba has a statistically significant effect but the same effect is not as significant for the \n\ngeometry 0/90\u00ba.  \n\nLikewise, the results are always better for pores of 300 \u00b5m as previously concluded. This can \n\nbe correlated to the fact that scaffolds with a geometry of 0/45\u00ba and 300 \u00b5m provide a larger \n\nsurface area than pores of 600 \u00b5m and 0/90\u00ba.   \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Results and discussion \n\n \n\n80 \n\n   \n\n \n\nObserving Figures 43 and 44, it seems that the four cases have significant differences in their \n\nresults, although the major differences occur for the geometry of 0/45\u00ba and a pore of 300 \u00b5m, \n\nwhich is in accordance with Figures 41 and 42. \n\nIn appendix 2, 3 and 4 the graphs relatives to normal probability for macrophages, fibroblasts \n\nand co-culture response are represented. \n\nIn order to improve cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation within scaffolds, two \n\ndifferent types of scaffolds were submitted to an oxygen-based plasma modification. These \n\ntwo types of scaffolds were chosen based on the previous results. Thus, the architecture that \n\nprovides better results (300 \u00b5m, 0/45\u00ba) was first chosen. The chosen scaffolds\u2019 compositions \n\nwere pure PCL and PCL-HA S with 10% of HA S by weight. The main goal of this experiment \n\nwas to try to evaluate if a plasma treatment would improve the scaffolds\u2019 surface bioactivity. \n\nFurthermore, based on the obtained results, it was also possible to compare the effect of the \n\ncomposition and the geometry on MTT results after the plasma treatment.  \n\n \n\nFigures 41 and 42: Influence of the percentage of HA in function of the pore and type of HA for the geometry \n\n0/45\u00ba and 0/90\u00ba, respectively. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Results and discussion \n\n \n\n81 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 6 shows the parameters used in DOE for this analysis.

This means \n\nthat, although the plasma treatment increased the surface hydrophilicity, the total amount of \n\noxygen containing groups and the total surface energy of the scaffolds, a good pore geometry \n\nand interconnectivity continues to be essential for the success of the cell-scaffold interaction.  \n\n \n\nFigure 43 and 44: Influence of the percentage of HA in function of the geometry and type of HA for the pores \nsize of 300 \u00b5m and 600 \u00b5m, respectively. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Results and discussion \n\n \n\n82 \n\n  \n\n \n\n                  Figure 47: Pareto Chart for the co-culture. \n\n \n\nAs referred in page 72 a scaffold with interconnected pore structure should improve the \n\nattachment and cell proliferation for a complete in vivo tissue regeneration.   \n\nIn these figures (Figures 45 to 47) it can be observed that the scaffolds composition, \n\nspecifically, the presence or not of HA also has more influence in the results than the plasma \n\ntreatment. This reflects the high requirement to add HA particles to PCL, in order to increase \n\nthe bioactivity of the composite scaffolds compared to the scaffolds of pure PCL.  \n\n \n\nAs demonstrated in Figure 47, for the co-culture all the parameters are statistically significant.  \n\nIn Figures 48 to 50 the interactions between factors after plasma treatment are represented. As \n\nit is possible to be seen, the plasma treatment has a major effect to the geometry of 0/45\u00ba, since \n\nFigures 45 and 46: Pareto Chart for fibroblasts and macrophages, respectively, where A corresponds to the \ncomposition of the scaffolds, B to the Plasma treatment and C to the scaffolds geometry. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Results and discussion \n\n \n\n83 \n\nthese pores enable a better air penetration than the pores with a geometry of 0/90\u00ba, and there is \n\na higher surface area available for the modification.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigures 48 and 49: Representation of the interaction between factors with plasma treatment for fibroblasts and \nmacrophages, respectively. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 50: Interactions between factors for co-culture. \n\n \n\nIn these figures (Figure 48 to 50) it is also possible to see that the plasma treatment has a greater \n\neffect for scaffolds of pure PCL, compared to the composite scaffolds of PCL-HA S 10%. This \n\nis probably due to the fact that HA, unlike PCL, does not interact with the radicals created by \n\nthe plasma treatment. \n\n \n\nThe graphs of the results obtained by the software SPSS are in appendix 6.  \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Results and discussion \n\n \n\n84 \n\n5.2  In vitro studies with endodontic cements \n\nThe macrophages used for this work are peritoneal macrophages, harvested from Wistar rats \n\nin IB-IBLI (the same place where the study took place). Using fresh macrophages implies that \n\nWistar rats are available at the time of the experiment. Since macrophages do not divide in \n\nvitro, their harvest should be done on the eve of the programmed experiment. In this context, \n\nprior work has been done in IBILI to test if fresh and frozen3 macrophages would provide \n\nreliable and comparable results. \n\n Nevertheless, a comparison between the results obtained with fresh and frozen macrophages \n\nwas repeated in order to ensure the results and to facilitate the preparation of future assays.  \n\nMann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to calculate \u2018p\u2019 value among different test \n\ngroups (p<0.001 indicates a significant difference among different groups).  \n\nThus, for this assay, two different volumes (0.02 and 0.03 mL) of endodontic material were \n\ntested. Wells with cells (fresh or frozen macrophages) and culture medium were used as control \n\ngroup. The obtained results are represented in Figures 51-53. As it can be seen in these figures \n\nthere are no significant differences between fresh and frozen macrophages, independently of \n\nthe material volume that was used. Thus, the next assays with macrophages could be done \n\nusing frozen macrophages, since freezing does not alter their properties.  \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigures 51 and 52: Representation of the obtained results for fresh and frozen macrophages, with 0.02 mL of material (on \nthe left) and with 0.03 mL of material, on the left. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Results and discussion \n\n \n\n85 \n\n \n\nFigure 53: Representation of the obtained results for the control group with fresh and frozen macrophages. \n\n \n\nIn order to study the influence that different volumes of material might have in the interaction \n\nbetween cells and the endodontic materials, specifically AH Plus JetTM, GuttaFlow\u00ae 2 and the \n\n\u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae, at 72 hours, three different volumes: 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03 mL of each \n\none of the materials, were tested.  \n\nFrom the analysis of the obtained results for each one of the volumes it can be seen that for \n\n0.01 mL, statistically significant differences (p<0.05) have been found between all the \n\nmaterials in study. For the volume of 0.02 mL, statistically significant differences have been \n\nfound between GuttaFlow\u00ae 2 and AH Plus JetTM, as well as between GuttaFlow\u00ae 2 and the \n\n\u201cimproved\u201d Guttaflow. For tests made with 0.03 mL of the material, statistically significant \n\ndifferences only have been found between GuttaFlow\u00ae 2 and the \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae.  \n\nHowever, for each material no statistically significant differences occur between the different \n\nused volumes.

The significance level is 0.05.    \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Results and discussion \n\n \n\n86 \n\nBased on the previously referred observations, it can be conclude that the used material has \n\nmore influence in the results than the chosen volume.  \n\nDuring this work, it was also decided to study a possible temporal influence. To this purpose, \n\ntests during 120 hours were also done. Since for 72 hours no significant differences occurred \n\nbetween the different volumes of material that were tested, for 120 hours only two different \n\nvolumes were tested. The chosen volumes were 0.01 and 0.02 mL, since the previously \n\nobtained results for 0.02 and 0.03 mL were very similar. Moreover, the 0.03 mL would be \n\nhigher than the quantity of the material used in a real endodontic treatment situation.  \n\nComparing the obtained results for 120 hours with the ones obtained for 72 hours, it is possible \n\nto conclude that the better results occur for 72 hours, which means that at 120 hours the \n\nmaterials appear to be more toxic to cells. The values decreased with time, and it is also \n\npossible to verify that the greatest (negative) variations occur for the highest volume of the \n\nmaterial, in this case 0.02 mL (since tests with 0.03 mL were not made at 120 hours). This is \n\nsupported by the literature, since for longer times, increasing the surface of contact between \n\nthe root canal sealer and the medium, the amount of leaching molecules within the medium \n\nincreases and consequently increases the cytotoxicity of the material [133].  \n\nFor all the assays that were done until now the \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae shows better MTT \n\nresults than AH Plus JetTM and GuttaFlow\u00ae 2, both at 72 and 120 hours.  \n\nSince GuttaFlow\u00ae 2 and the \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae have Gutta-percha in a powder form in \n\ntheir composition, and AH Plus JetTM in vivo is never used without a core obturation material, \n\nthe behavior of AH Plus JetTM combined with small pieces of Gutta-Percha cones was also \n\nstudied and the results were compared with the ones obtained using only AH Plus JetTM, \n\nGuttaFlow\u00ae 2 and the \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae. The obtained results are represented in Figure \n\n54 for each one of the used cell types. As it is possible to see in this figure, the obtained results \n\nfor AH Plus JetTM are better than the ones obtained for the set AH Plus JetTM + small pieces of \n\nGutta-percha. However, between all the tested materials the \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae continues \n\nto be the less cytotoxic of the tested materials.   \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Results and discussion \n\n \n\n87 \n\nAH Plus JetTM has a complex chemical composition, which is why there are several substances \n\nthat can be released during the polymerization and thereby cause toxic effects. Thus, a possible \n\nexplanation for the cytotoxic character of AH Plus JetTM might be the release of the amine and \n\nepoxy resin components of the sealer [74]. Besides this, the present amines also can accelerate \n\nthe polymerization of the material. Additionally, despite the manufacturer referring this being \n\na \u201cformaldehyde free\u201d material several studies demonstrate that AH Plus JetTM has a small \n\npercentage of this component in its composition [74,134-136]. This endodontic cement has \n\nantibacterial effect which can also contribute to the toxic effects [137].  \n\nGuttaFlow\u00ae 2 appears to be more cytotoxic than AH Plus JetTM and the \u201cimproved\u201d \n\nGuttaFlow\u00ae in these studies. This could be due to some extra-additives of GuttaFlow\u00ae 2. It \n\ncontains Gutta-percha powder and micro-silver as a preservative. The Gutta-percha powder \n\ncan have an irritating effect in tissues, and silver according to reported studies has some toxicity \n\n[74,137-140]. \n\nTests during 72 hours were also done with fibroblasts and co-culture of fibroblasts and \n\nmacrophages. In these assays the cytotoxicity of the materials were only tested for two different \n\nvolumes: 0.01 and 0.02 mL. Thus, observing the obtained results for fibroblast and co-culture \n\nno statistically significant differences can be found between the different materials. \n\nIt is possible to see in Figure 54 that the behavior of the different materials are similar for all \n\ntested cell types, with single exception of GuttaFlow\u00ae 2, which provides much better results \n\nfor the case of co-culture. A hypothesis to explain it could be that GuttaFlow\u00ae 2 has properties \n\nthat stimulate the interaction between the material and connective tissue (e.g: fibroblasts).   \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Results and discussion \n\n \n\n88 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 54: Representation of the behavior of the different materials for all the tested \ncell types, where GF2 corresponds to GuttaFlow 2,  AH+ to AH Plus Jet, GF3 \nto the \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow, AH+&amp;GP, to the set Ah Plus Jet plus small \npieces of Gutta-percha cones and finally GP refers  to Gutta- percha . \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Results and discussion \n\n \n\n89 \n\n5.3  In vivo studies with endodontic cements \u2013 Histologic study \n\nAs referred in Chapter 4, for the in vivo studies, the materials were implanted in the \n\nsubcutaneous tissue within abocat tubes of 8 mm. For this purpose, four different groups have \n\nbeen done. The first group was the control group and consisted in the implantation of empty \n\ntubes in order to study the reaction of the tissue to their presence. The other three groups \n\nconsisted in the implantation of tubes containing the materials that had been tested: AH Plus \n\nJetTM, GuttaFlow\u00ae 2 and the \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae. These materials had been implanted in \n\ntubes in order to mimic what happens in clinic, as only the tip of the material contained inside \n\nthe tube can contact with surrounding tissue. \n\n \n\nControl \n\nOn the 8th day, no formation of fibrous capsule was observed (Figure 55). It was also observed \n\nthe presence of inflammatory infiltrate. It can thus be concluded that no reaction to the tube \n\nhas occurred. In Figure 56 an image of the skin without the presence of foreign body reaction \n\ncan be observed. \n\n \n\n \n\nA\n\n \nB\n\n \n\nC\n\n D\n\n \nE\n\n Figure 55: Microscopic image of the site where the \ncontrol tube has been implanted, being A a \n\nblood capillary, B areolar cells, C the \n\nsubcutaneous tissue where the control tube \n\nwas implanted and D adipose tissue cells.    \n\nFigure 56: Microscopic image of rat skin without \n\ntube/material implantation, where A \n\ncorresponds to hair follicles, B to sebaceous \n\nglands, C to the hair erector muscle, D to \n\ncollagenous fibers and E to the cellular \n\nsubcutaneous tissue. \n\nA\n\n \n\nB\n\n C\n\n \n\nD\n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Results and discussion \n\n \n\n90 \n\nAH Plus JetTM \n\nEight days following the subcutaneous implantation of the tubes containing AH Plus JetTM the \n\nintensity of the inflammatory reaction is milder and the tissue was organized exhibiting the \n\nformation of connective fibers (Figures 57-58).

Figure 64 \n\nrepresents the place where the tube with the \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow is. In this figure some \n\ninflammatory infiltrate can be observed, although in a much smaller degree than for the case \n\nof the other studied materials.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBased on the previous results, it can be concluded that no inflammatory reaction occurs due to \n\nthe presence of the tubes. Thus, the fibrotic capsules that were formed surrounding tubes with \n\nGuttaFlow\u00ae 2 and AH Plus JetTM are due to the presence of these materials. Comparing the \n\nresults obtained for each one of the three tested materials it can be concluded that the highest \n\ninflammatory reaction occurs in the presence of AH Plus JetTM, and the less inflammatory \n\nreaction occurs in the presence of the \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae. \n\n \n\nFigure 63: Microscopic image of the site where the tube \n\nwith \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae was implanted \n\n(test during 8 days).

Furthermore, as previously referred, another main goal of this work \n\nis the study of cytotoxic behavior of three endodontic materials with different compositions, \n\nin order to determine which of them have better biological properties. The final conclusions of \n\nthis work are then reported, accord to the goals indicated above and explained in detail in \n\nChapter 3.  \n\n \n\n6.1.1  Conclusions of the study with scaffolds for TE  \n\nThe fundamental concept of TE predicts the combination of a scaffold with cells or active \n\nbiological molecules in order to obtain a bioimplant able to promote tissue reparation and/or \n\nregeneration. Thus, the design of scaffolds for TE must obey several mechanical, chemical and \n\nbiological requirements. However, the quantity and the diversity of these requirements increase \n\nthe complexity associated with the scaffolds production. To reduce this complexity, additive \n\nfabrication technologies, which are able to produce structures with higher geometric precision, \n\nhave emerged. Therefore, in Chapter 2, a detailed revision of the scaffolds\u2019 requirements and \n\nof the different additive fabrication technologies was made, namely for those that were \n\nspecifically developed for TE. Between the different classes of biomaterials used in TE special \n\nattention was given to synthetic polymers and ceramic materials, namely to PCL and HA (see \n\nChapter 3). PCL and HA are FDA approved materials, that when combined present better \n\nbiological and bioactive properties.  \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Conclusions and future work \n\n  \n\n94 \n\nIn Chapter 4, the description of the performed procedures has been done and in Chapter 5 a \n\ndetailed analysis of the obtained results was done. Through variation of the pore size and the \n\ndeposition angle, it was possible to obtain scaffolds with different porosities and pore \n\narchitectures. The obtained results allow drawing some conclusions: \n\n? from the point of cellular adhesion and differentiation, scaffolds with a pore size of 300 \n\n\u00b5m and a geometry of 0/45\u00ba are those with the best performance; \n\n? the architecture of 300 \u00b5m 0/45\u00ba correspond to the architecture with the lowest porosity \n\nvalues.  \n\nThese results show that scaffolds with lower porosity promote a better interaction between \n\ncells and scaffolds and consequently, increase the cell adhesion and proliferation. \n\nSince the MTT assay is a qualitative measure of mitochondrial function, it has been used as a \n\nmeasure of cytotoxicity. This assay considers that the number of active living cells is inversely \n\nproportional to the cytotoxicity value. Thus, it can be concluded that the higher the number of \n\nactive cells that adhere and proliferate within the scaffolds, the lower is the cytotoxicity of the \n\nscaffold. Therefore, it can be concluded that the scaffold\u2019s architecture with a pore size of 300 \n\n\u00b5m and a geometry of 0/45\u00ba is the one with the lowest cytotoxicity behavior.  \n\nBeyond the study of the architecture influence, the effect of HA addition to pure PCL scaffolds \n\nwas also evaluated, as well as the influence of different types and percentages of HA used for \n\nthe production of PCL-HA composite scaffolds. The mixtures (PCL-HA) were prepared by \n\nmelt blending (see Chapter 4), which have the advantage of not requiring the use of organic \n\nsolvents with high toxic potential to the cells. The obtained results for the cytotoxicity studies \n\nthat were done indicate that the composite scaffolds of PCL-HA have a much higher ability to \n\npromote cellular adhesion and survival of macrophages and proliferation of fibroblasts and of \n\ntheir co-culture. Comparing the obtained results with the two different types of HA that were \n\nstudied (HA N and HA S) it has been verified that the composite scaffolds of PCL-HA N \n\npromote a higher cell adhesion and proliferation, which means that these composite scaffolds \n\nare less toxic to cells. This probably occurs due to the higher biodegradation rate of HA N, \n\ncomparatively with the same one of the HA S, which results from the presence of carbonate \n\ngroups and ions (e.g. magnesium ions) in HA N.  \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Conclusions and future work \n \n\n95 \n\nThese results lead to the conclusion that the addition of HA increases the bioactivity of \n\nscaffolds, independently of the percentage and of the type of HA that was used. It was also \n\npossible to conclude that pore size is the factor that most influences the cytotoxicity properties \n\nand consequently, cell adhesion and proliferation on scaffolds.   \n\n \n6.1.2  Conclusions of the study with endodontic materials \n\nThe second goal of this work, was to evaluate the cytotoxicity of three endodontic cements, \n\nrespectively AH Plus JetTM, GuttaFlow\u00ae2 and the \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae, with different \n\ncompositions on the presence of cells of the connective tissue (fibroblasts), the immune system \n\n(macrophages) and their co-culture. Based on the obtained MTT results it is possible to \n\nconclude that the \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae is the material presenting the lowest cytotoxicity, \n\nwhich is expressed by the higher number of cells that adhere and proliferate in contact with \n\nthis material. The studies with these endodontic sealers also allow verifying that the \n\ncytotoxicity of these materials increases with time, namely for higher volumes of material. \n\nThis occurs since for longer times, as referred in Chapter 5, increasing the surface of contact \n\nbetween the root canal sealer/endodontic cement and the medium, increases the amount of \n\nleaching molecules within the medium and consequently increases the cytotoxicity of the \n\nendodontic material.    \n\nThe interpretation of these results is not easy, due the high variation of the effects of each one \n\nof the studied materials and each of the used volumes in all the studied parameters. None of \n\nthe endodontic materials is totally biocompatible, since all of them have some level of \n\ncytotoxicity, which is expect attending all the requirements of these materials, namely the \n\nbactericidal effect.  \n\nIn the in vivo studies that were performed it was possible to observe an external reaction of the \n\nskin to the presence of GuttaFlow\u00ae 2. The histological studies allow to conclude that the \n\nhighest inflammatory reaction occurs in the presence of AH Plus JetTM, and the less \n\ninflammatory reaction occurs in the presence of the \u201cimproved\u201d GuttaFlow\u00ae. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Conclusions and future work \n\n  \n\n96 \n\n6.2  Future work \n\nUpon the obtained results, tests with dental pulp stem cells, which are multipotent stem cells \n\nthat have the potential to differentiate into a variety of cell types, including osteoblasts, will be \n\ndone. For that, an electromagnetic technique using microbeads and specific antibody markers, \n\nwill be used [12-13].  \n\nStudies of tri-culture of fibroblasts, macrophages and osteoblasts could also be done, for both \n\nstudies with scaffolds and endodontic cements. \n\nThe scaffolds observation using SEM technology could also be done in order to clarify if cells \n\nmigrate to the interior of the scaffolds or if they mainly adhere to the surface.  \n\nResults obtained using the scaffolds sterilized with ethylene oxide will be compared with the \n\nresults obtained with the scaffolds sterilized by gamma radiation.  \n\nBased upon the obtained results with fibroblasts, macrophages and their co-culture, and also \n\nwith osteoblasts and their tri-culture with macrophages and fibroblasts, in vivo studies should \n\nalso be done with scaffolds in order to evaluate the in vivo biocompatibility of these materials.  \n\nIn vivo studies with the endodontic materials should also be done again, but this time they \n\nshould be implanted in the bone tissue instead of subcutaneously.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n97 \n \n\nReferences \n \n\n[1] Leong, K.F., Chua, C.K., Sudarmadji, N. and Yeong, W.Y.
