The destruction caused due to the geological setting of an area \n\nis termed as site effect. To model the site effect of an area is to determine the shaking level \n\nlongevity and its displacement amplification. The elastic properties (shear and compressional \n\nwave velocities, density, thickness of soil layer, etc.) of the site are required to find out by \n\nemploying various geophysical procedures. The knowledge of these elastic properties help in \n\nbetter designing the infrastructure, which reduces the chances of destruction caused by a local \n\ngeological setting due to an earthquake occurrence. This procedure is widely termed as \n\nmicrozonation. The most important parameters for the microzonation are the thickness of soft \n\nsediments over the seismic bedrock and its shear wave velocity profile. These two parameters are \n\nproperly characterized by employing various geophysical techniques like borehole measurement, \n\nseismic reflection and seismic refraction. The conventional geophysical methods bring some \n\nhindrance to the picture such as, the drilling of a borehole and artificial seismic sources \n\ndeployment for the reflection and refraction survey, which are both expensive and time \n\nconsuming, difficult or even in some case impossible to implement in urbanized environment, \n\nthe investigation is depth limited to few tens of meter. The methods which replaced this \n\nconventional geophysical method from the last decades or so is the analysis of Earth vibration \n\ncaused by the seismic noise which is produced by both natural and cultural sources. This ambient \n\nseismic noise can be recorded with less cost and effort with good lateral coverage. Various \n\nseismic noise techniques are employed for this job; however, the one which got the most \n\nattention in recent years is the horizontal over vertical spectral ratio (H/V) technique. The H/V \n\nspectral ratio curve is a fast easy and cheap tool for the near-subsurface characterization. There \n\nare various study performed on the topic which has tried to cover almost all the aspects and \n\nproblems associated with the method. Here in this study, we try to detail the aspects of this \n\ntechnique, which are not been evaluated fully. The different modelling procedures presented to \n\nmodel and physically link the H/V curve with some physical phenomenon will be discussed and \n\nits numerical result with the experimental H/V curve will be compared for a borehole test site.  \n\nThe peak and the shape of the H/V curve will be modelled to find its peak frequency deviation \n\nfrom the shear wave resonance frequency by considering different wave-field around the peak. \n\nSimilarly, the shape dominancy of the H/V curve linkage will be find out. The peak frequency of \n\nthe H/V curve is used to estimate the thickness-frequency relation by regression analysis. Here \n\nwe will show that the dispersion curve obtained from multi-channel analysis of surface waves \n\n(MASW) can be used to estimate the velocity at one meter and the shear wave velocity increase \n\ntrend with depth. These values can be used to estimate the thickness frequency relation for an \n\narea and its result will be compared with the experimentally derived thickness-frequency \n\nrelationship for the same area. The sensitivity of the H/V curve shape to the subsurface velocity \n\nstructure will find out for two main modelling techniques (Rayleigh wave ellipticity and diffused \n\nfield based H/V curve). The different parts of the H/V curve are inverted (back modelled) to find \n\n\n\n \n \n\nVI \n \n\nout the part of H/V curve which is carrying the most important information about the subsurface \n\nstructure. The lesson learned from all this analysis will be applied to experimental data of three \n\ndifferent sites. The Love waves might contaminate the result of the H/V curve. Two different \n\ntechniques to remove their effects will be discussed.  Then, the joint inversion result of the \n\ndispersion and this Love effect removed H/V for more precisely ellipticity curve is discussed. \n\nSome new aspects of the H/V curve technique are also discussed at the end.  \n\nKey Words.

A \n\ndestrui\u00e7\u00e3o causada devido \u00e0 configura\u00e7\u00e3o geol\u00f3gica da \u00e1rea \u00e9 denominada como efeito local. A \n\nmodelagem do efeito local implica na determina\u00e7\u00e3o do tempo e n\u00edvel de vibra\u00e7\u00e3o e do efeito de \n\namplifica\u00e7\u00e3o do deslocamento. As propriedades el\u00e1sticas dos materiais geol\u00f3gicos (velocidade \n\ndas ondas de compress\u00e3o e de cisalhamento, densidade, espessura da camada de solo, etc.) \n\npodem ser obtidas por diversos m\u00e9todos geof\u00edsicos. O conhecimento dessas propriedades \n\nel\u00e1sticas ajuda a melhor projetar as infraestruturas e reduzir as chances de danos. Este \n\nprocedimento \u00e9 denominado de microzoneamento. Os par\u00e2metros mais importantes para realizar \n\no microzoneamento s\u00e3o as espessuras dos sedimentos que recobrem o embasamento e o perfil \n\ndas velocidades das ondas S (cisalhamento). Esses dois par\u00e2metros s\u00e3o adequadamente \n\ncaracterizados pelo uso de v\u00e1rias t\u00e9cnicas geof\u00edsicas como perfilagens em furos de sondagem, \n\nreflex\u00e3o e refra\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00edsmica. Esses m\u00e9todos geof\u00edsicos trazem algumas restri\u00e7\u00f5es como a \n\nnecessidade da execu\u00e7\u00e3o de um furo, emprego de fontes s\u00edsmicas artificiais que muitas vezes s\u00e3o \n\ndispendiosas e por vezes de uso restrito em \u00e1reas urbanas, al\u00e9m de muitas vezes estarem \n\nlimitadas a investiga\u00e7\u00f5es de apenas algumas dezenas de metros. Os m\u00e9todos que substitu\u00edram \n\nesses m\u00e9todos geof\u00edsicos convencionais nas \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas s\u00e3o a an\u00e1lise do ru\u00eddo s\u00edsmico \n\nproduzido por fontes naturais e culturais. Este ru\u00eddo s\u00edsmico ambiental pode ser registrado com \n\nmenor custo e esfor\u00e7o e com boa cobertura lateral. V\u00e1rias t\u00e9cnicas que se utilizam do ru\u00eddo \n\ns\u00edsmico podem ser empregadas, no entanto, aquela que obteve maior aten\u00e7\u00e3o nos \u00faltimos anos \u00e9 \n\na t\u00e9cnica da raz\u00e3o do espectro horizontal sobre o espectro vertical da onda de superf\u00edcie (H/V). A \n\ncurva da raz\u00e3o espectral H/V \u00e9 uma ferramenta r\u00e1pida, f\u00e1cil e de baixo custo para a \n\ncaracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o da subsuperf\u00edcie rasa. Existem v\u00e1rios estudos realizados sobre o tema que \n\ntentaram cobrir todos os aspectos e problemas associados ao m\u00e9todo. Aqui neste estudo s\u00e3o \n\naprofundados alguns aspectos ainda n\u00e3o avaliados em detalhe. Diferentes procedimentos para a \n\nmodelagem e as associa\u00e7\u00f5es entre os fen\u00f4menos f\u00edsicos envolvidos e as caracter\u00edsticas da curva \n\nH/V s\u00e3o discutidos e os resultados num\u00e9ricos desses estudos s\u00e3o comparados com informa\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nextra\u00eddas de perfis de sondagens de um dos locais estudados.

O \n\nestudo mostra que a curva de dispers\u00e3o obtida a partir de um ensaio MASW pode ser usada para \n\nestimar a velocidade da onda S a um metro de profundidade e sua tend\u00eancia de aumento com a \n\nprofundidade. Esses valores podem ser usados para estimar a rela\u00e7\u00e3o frequ\u00eancia-espessura para \n\numa \u00e1rea. Esses resultados s\u00e3o comparados com a rela\u00e7\u00e3o frequ\u00eancia-espessura derivada \n\nexperimentalmente para a mesma \u00e1rea.

Introduction  \n\n \n\nThe level of damage and destruction caused by an earthquake in developed area, like Mexico \n\nCity, Loma Prieta, Kobe and Izmit, followed a complicated pattern. This localized destruction is \n\nattributed to longer shaking and higher amplification of seismic motion caused by the geological \n\nand geotechnical setting of the area. It is also termed as local site effect. To model the site effect \n\nof an area is to determine the shake level longevity and its displacement amplification. For this, \n\nis required to find the elastic properties (shear and compressional wave velocities, densities, the \n\nthickness of soil layer, etc.) of the site which are inferred by employing various geophysical \n\nprocedures. This reduces the chances of destruction by an earthquake, that was caused by a local \n\ngeological setting. This procedure is widely termed as microzonation. \n\nThe two very important parameters of the microzonation studies are the thickness of the \n\nsediment cover and, most importantly, the shear wave velocity profile of the site. Both these \n\nparameters hold the capacity to estimate the amplification caused by soft soil cover in case of \n\nmotion triggered at its base due to the earthquake. To map out these important parameters, some \n\nconventional geophysical techniques are employed such as downhole measurement, seismic \n\nreflection and refraction. The conventional geophysical methods bring some hindrances to the \n\npicture such as drilling borehole and artificial seismic sources required for the reflection and \n\nrefraction survey, which are both expensive, time consuming and difficult or even, in some \n\ncases, impossible to implement in urbanized environment. The investigation depth is limited to \n\nfew tens of meter. The method that replaced these conventional geophysical methods from last \n\ndecades or so is the analysis of earth vibration caused by the seismic noise which is produced by \n\nboth natural and cultural sources. This ambient seismic noise can be recorded with less cost and \n\neffort with a good lateral coverage. Due to its large usage and importance for geological \n\ninvestigation and seismic hazard prevention, it was necessary to define the standard operation \n\nprotocol for the seismic noise data acquisition, processing and interpretation. A project initiated \n\nto design experimental, processing and interpretative protocol  with the collaboration of the 14 \n\nEuropean research institutes in the years of 2001-2004 (SESAME European Project) provided \n\nthe guidelines for the researchers involved with this theme, reported and are used extensively \n\nafterward. \n\n \n\n1.1 The objective of the study \n\n \n\nThe survey of seismic noise methods specially performed to estimate  shear wave velocity profile \n\nand thickness are done with a single 3 component seismometer, an array of 3c or one component \n\nvertical sensors. The single station measurement is used to obtain a horizontal over vertical \n\nFourier spectral ratio while the array method is used to retrieve the dispersion curve which is \n\ncombined with H/V curve and jointly inverted for the shear wave velocity profile estimation of \n\n\n\n \n \n\n2 \n \n\ndeep soil packages. Many studies performed on this topic have shown the results in a good \n\nagreement with borehole techniques. The basic assumption of those methods are that surface \n\nwave are dominating the seismic noise wavefield and the shape of the H/V curve are mostly \n\ndominated by fundamental mode of Rayleigh wave ellipticity. The seismic noise wavefield also \n\ncontains the fraction of Love and body waves which contaminate the H/V curve and deviates its \n\nshape from Rayleigh wave ellipticity. \n\nThe two most important features of the H/V curve are the peak frequency and the shape of the \n\ncurve. The peak frequency is used for the unconsolidated sediments thickness estimation of a site \n\nwhile the shape of the H/V curve, with some supplementary information, is utilized for the shear \n\nwave velocity profile retrieval through inversion. In this study we are going to investigate the \n\naspects of joint inversion on H/V and dispersion curves which have not been evaluated in detail \n\nyet, such as it is usually whispered that the peak of H/V provides a good estimative of the shear \n\nwave resonance frequency, even when the H/V curve is considered a proxy for Rayleigh wave \n\nellipticity. If this is the case, we will try to check the deviation of shear wave resonance \n\nfrequency deviation from the H/V peak frequency by forward modeling, considering the noise \n\nwavefield as completely dominated by Rayleigh waves, surface waves (both Love and Rayleigh \n\nwaves)  and equal contribution of body and surface waves (diffuse field). We will also try to list \n\nall the parameters (shear wave velocity, primary wave velocity, thickness and density of mass) \n\nwhich affect the shift of the peak frequency from the shear wave resonance frequency. \n\nThe other important use of the peak frequency is to derive a thickness-peak frequency regression \n\nrelationship of an interest area. This thickness-peak frequency relationship can be used to obtain \n\nthe soil deposit thickness by measuring seismic noise at a site and inputting the peak frequency \n\nof the H/V to the derived relationship. To obtain this thickness-peak frequency relationship, we \n\nmust have some borehole control points where the detailed information of the soil deposit is \n\navailable. The H/V curves are obtained at each control site and then the peak frequency is related \n\nto the soil thickness through the regression relationship. However, in the field it is difficult to \n\nhave the borehole as a control point for calibration. We will try to use dispersion curve of \n\nRayleigh wave and derived thickness-peak frequency relationship to analyze the role of borehole \n\ncontrol points if not available in the investigation area.  \n\nThe H/V curve shape deviates from the Rayleigh wave ellipticity due to the presence of the \n\nfraction Love and body waves in the noise wavefield. We will try to remove or minimize the \n\neffect of the Love and body waves presence on the noise wavefield and make the shape of the \n\nH/V curve closer to the Rayleigh ellipticity shape. The inversion of the H/V curve alone for the \n\nshear wave velocity retrieval always had a trade-off between S-wave velocity and thickness \n\nestimative. To overcome this trade-off some prior information is needed. The dispersion curve \n\nwill be analyzed to obtain the velocity increase trend which can be used to overcome this trade-\n\noff between thickness and S-wave velocity by inverting the ellipticity alone. The part of the H/V \n\ncurve which carries the most important information regarding the subsurface ground structure is \n\nnecessarily analyzed. The most ambiguous problem in all the surface wave inversion problem is \n\n\n\n \n \n\n3 \n \n\nhow to fix the subsurface layers prior to the inversion. This is very tricky to answer, however, we \n\ntried to find the sensitivity of ellipticity (H/V) curve shape deviation to layers within the earth. \n\nThe joint inversion of the H/V for the deep soil S-wave velocity profile retrieval is also very \n\nnecessary. Usually, there is no role to define weight of misfit for this two different targets. We \n\nwill try to design a weight function for both targets to find the misfit of the joint inversion in a \n\nway to account the number of sample data available for each target (dispersion and H/V curves). \n\nAll the observation of the analysis will be tested on three different sites in S\u00e3o Paulo state, \n\nBrazil, to jointly invert the H/V and dispersion curves. \n\n \n\n1.2 Organization of the thesis \n\n \n\nThe thesis is organized in two main sections. One (Chapters 2-5) dealing with the theoretical \n\nbackground from literature, while the second section (Chapters 6-10) is the analysis and the \n\nresults of the study. Chapter 1 describes the general introduction, objectives and the organization \n\nof the thesis. Chapter 2 is about the origin of seismic noise, techniques used for its analysis and \n\nits application for near surface are highlighted. Chapter 3: a brief introduction to the H/V \n\nmethods, it has a theoretical summary and the practical aspects of the data analysis are discussed. \n\nChapter 4: The array technique used for surface wave, especially Rayleigh wave analysis, is \n\ndescribed in detail for the SASW and MASW. Chapter 5: the inversion algorithm used for the \n\nstudy is explained briefly (how the parameter space is modeled and how the new model is \n\ngenerated). The modeling technique of the H/V curve is described in Chapter 6, where the noise \n\nwavefield is considered to be dominated by the Body waves, Rayleigh waves, only considering \n\nthe effect of both Love and body waves, and by the diffused wave field situation.  \n\nThe analysis of the peak frequency of H/V curve is discussed in Chapter 7 by the forward \n\nmodeling. The sensitivity of the peak frequency against Poisson ratio, Vs, Vp, thickness (h) and \n\ndensity (   is analyzed, so is the sensitivity of the H/V curve for different number of layers. \n\nChapter 8 describes the thickness-peak frequency relation for the 7 borehole sites at the \n\nBebedouro area (one of the study areas). The MASW dispersion curves are used to obtain the \n\nshear wave velocity increase trend of the area. These information are used to obtain the \n\nthickness-frequency relation and then compared with the borehole and H/V peak-frequency \n\nrelation experimentally derived. Chapter 9 is about the analysis of part of ellipticity which is \n\ncarrying the most relevant information regarding the subsurface structure. The misfit function is \n\ndiscussed and defined for the joint inversion of ellipticity and dispersion curve. Finally, Chapter \n\n10 describes the results of the joint inversion on three studied sites: IAG, Col\u00f4nia and \n\nBebedouro. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n4 \n \n\n \n\nChapter 2: A review of seismic noise \n\n2. Introduction \n\nThe term microzonation is a very familiar expression frequently used in seismology and \n\nearthquake engineering for seismically active area classifications. The microzonation is actually \n\nthe characterization and division of the seismically active area into sub-regions on the basis of \n\npredicted risk in case of earthquake damage. This analysis is made as precautions to mitigate \n\nhazard and safely design of the infrastructure and dwelling (water and gas pipelines, electricity \n\ndistribution, schools, hospitals and roads/bridges infrastructures). For the microzonation studies, \n\nthe velocity model, especially shear wave velocity structure, has a great importance, since it is \n\nactually responsible for the major destruction. This velocity model helps in quantifying how \n\ndestructive the effect of the surface wave will be in the case of an earthquake occurrence. So, the \n\nvelocity model of the structure information is the prime interest for the microzonation. \n\nUnfortunately, this microzonation is desired to be performed on the urbanized area where it is \n\ndifficult to employ conventional geophysical techniques. To overcome this problem, passive and \n\nnon-destructive active methods, like spectral analysis of surface saves (SASW) and multichannel \n\nanalysis of surface waves (MASW), are developed, which are based on the ambient seismic \n\nnoise recording and hammer seismic, respectively, and can be easily implemented on urbanized \n\narea. Prioritizing to describe that technique, in brief, we present a review of the nature of seismic \n\nnoise. First, an attempt will be made to explain the term seismic noise, its nature and its different \n\naspects. Later, the techniques that use seismic noise for the geophysical and engineering \n\napplications. \n\n2.1 Seismic noise \n\nThe scientists that deals with measured/recorded data such as seismologists often use the term \n\nnoise for the unwanted portion of data. The seismic noise is considered as a random and non-\n\ndeterministic process in nature. It is considered non-deterministic because it is very difficult to \n\nmathematically formulate the randomness of the process that generates it or, as we may say, it \n\nseems random to us because we do not know all the processes which contribute in the generation \n\nof it.  \n\nThe main signal in seismology is the earthquake record, which is used to model the earth \n\nproperties from the mechanical vibration signal produced by the earthquake.  The dynamic \n\nnature of the Earth is supported by the fact that its surface is constantly modified by some of its \n\ninternal and external processes along the geologic time scale. The earthquake is one of the main \n\nevidence presented to support this claim, however, an earthquake is not the only proof of its \n\nvibrant nature. There is a permanent small amplitude vibration that causes very small \n\ndisplacements. This permanent vibration on the surface of the Earth could not be related to the \n\nearthquake, so it is termed as seismic noise by the seismologists. So our first goal, here, is: try to \n\n\n\n \n \n\n5 \n \n\nunderstand the origin of the seismic noise from the literature review. Before the advent of \n\nstandard instrumentation for the recording of earthquakes, the studies made on the analysis of \n\nseismic noise were mainly qualitatives, however, soon after the development of instrumentation \n\nand technical facilities such as the computers, Kanai (1954), Aki (1957) and Akamatsu (1961) \n\nwere the first researchers who pointed out that the soil characteristics can be inferred from the \n\nanalysis of seismic ambient noise.  This opened a corridor toward the precise understanding of \n\nnature of the seismic noise wavefield and its use for the subsurface information retrieval. This \n\nreminds an old saying \u201cOne man noise is another man signal\u201d. Scales &amp; Snieder (1998) \n\nconsider the transcription \u201cnoise is that part of the data that we choose not to explain\u201d. \n\n2.2. Seismic sources of noise \n\nGenerally, the seismic noise wavefield is the superposition of many seismic signals generated by \n\nvarious natural and man-made sources. The seismic noise wavefield is unpredictable because we \n\ndo not know the different sources, and if the sources are known, then we are unaware of each \n\nsource contribution to the noise wavefield. The natural  sources of seismic noise, in general, are \n\nocean tides, water-waves striking the coast, standing water waves in the open seas due to storm \n\nsystems, air pressure changes, turbulent wind or wind-induced vibrations of trees or tall \n\nbuildings and man-made sources such as car and train traffic, industrial machines, explosions or \n\nthe exploitation of underground reservoirs e.g. hydrocarbons, geothermal (Sesame, 2004). \n\nA comprehensive and complete literature review of the current knowledge about the seismic \n\nnoise wave field is given by Bonnefoy-Claudet et al. (2004, 2006a). They have shown that \n\nalthough many kinds of noise sources exist, they can be easily classified in a simple term: the \n\nnatural and anthropogenic sources. Concerning the origin of the noise, Gutenberg (1958) lists the \n\ndifferent types of sources according to the frequency of the relevant seismic motion. Several \n\nyears later, other authors got the same conclusions (Asten, 1978; Asten &amp; Henstridge, 1984). A \n\nsummary about the frequency dependency of noise sources is shown in Table 2.1 \n\n Gutenberg  1958 Asten 1978-1984 \n\nWaves striking at Coast 0.01-0.5Hz 0.5-1.2Hz \n\nLarge scale metrological \n\nperturbation \n\n0.1-0.25 Hz 0.16-0.5 \n\nCyclone over ocean 0.3-1Hz 0.5-3Hz \n\nLocal metrological conditions 1.4-5Hz ------ \n\nVolcanic tremor 2-10 Hz ------ \n\nUrban 1-100 Hz 1.3-30 Hz \n\nTable 2. 1: Summary of noise sources according to frequency after Gutenberg (1958) and Asten (1978, 1984) (from \n\nSESAME Project, report WP08, 2003). \n\nAlmost all the authors working on the problem of understanding the nature of seismic noise \n\nwavefield agreed that the boundary between man-made noise and natural noise is around 1 Hz. \n\nBelow one Hz (<1Hz ?Long-period ) noise is termed as microseism and above one Hz (>1Hz \n\n?short-period) noise is termed as microtremor. The term microseism and microtremor are not \n\n\n\n \n \n\n6 \n \n\nfully used in the literature of seismology. We will try to use these both terms for seismic noise \n\nwave-field equally in some places at this study. Information listed in Table 2.1 can be described \n\nin terms of frequency.  It is possible to see from this short summary that surface waves are an \n\nessential component of seismic noise. In fact, even if their importance decrease with the increase \n\nof frequency, their role is always significant from the Table 2.1. It can be observed that, at \n\nfrequencies below 0.5 Hz, the sources are natural (ocean, large-scale meteorological conditions). \n\nSo, at low frequencies, seismic noise is generally stable, it has high coherence, and consists \n\nmainly of surface waves. In the intermediate frequency range between 0.5 to 1 Hz, sources are \n\nboth natural (local meteorological conditions) and anthropogenic (urban). Thus, in this case, the \n\nnoise is less stable and the fraction of the surface waves is variable. Finally, for frequencies \n\nhigher than 1 Hz, sources are essentially anthropogenic. As a consequence of the elevated \n\nvariability of the anthropogenic sources, at high frequencies, the seismic noise is extremely \n\nunstable both in amplitude and in terms of the ratio between body and surface waves. \n\n2.3 The composition of noise wavefield \n\n \n\nThe seismic noise field is assumed to be dominated by surface wave field as demonstrated by \n\nsome studies (Douze, 1964; Bormann 2012). Bonnefoy-Claudet et al. (2006a) made an extensive \n\nreview of the composition of the noise wavefield. Here, the developments made in this direction \n\nare listed and discussed, such as their uses for the engineering applications. The seismic noise \n\nwavefield was believed, and it is still the case, to be dominated by the fundamental mode of \n\nRayleigh waves. The ocean generated double frequency noise wavefield, that is considered to be \n\nthe main source of seismic noise wavefield (Gutenberg, 1911; Longuet-Higgins, 1950). The \n\ndominancy of noise field by the Rayleigh wave fundamental mode is considered true for the \n\nmost cases of ocean-generated noise wave field within a period of 5-20 s (Brooks et al., 2009). \n\nThe characteristic of this important noise generated source is assigned to be the same for the \n\nshortest and longest period dominated by this noise generation sources. \n\nDue to the development of seismic noise wavefield recording sensors (3component seismometer) \n\nand processing ease due to the modern computer, it is observed that seismic noise field contain \n\nboth body and surface waves. At lower frequencies (0.04 to 0.15 Hz) the noise wavefield is \n\ndominated by Rayleigh and Love waves fundamental modes (Lacoss et al. 1969; Kurrle &amp; \n\nWidmer, 2008).  Generally, for the natural sources of seismic noise wavefield, it consists on \n\nhigher mode of Rayleigh waves, along with dominated fundamental mode (Brooks et al., 2009), \n\nLove waves (Saito, 2010) and a fraction of body waves (Koper et al., 2010). So, noise wavefield \n\ncomposition is debatable and one can simply narrow down its nature search by asking and \n\nfinding some answers to the questions likes (SESAME, 2004):  1. What is the proportion of body \n\nand surface wave energies in noise wavefield? If dominated by a surface wave then, 2. What are \n\nthe relative fractions of the Rayleigh and Love waves in noise wavefield? 3. If the seismic wave \n\nnoise wavefield is dominated by Rayleigh waves then what is the relation of fundamental mode \n\nto higher mode Rayleigh wave energy?  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n7 \n \n\nThe answer to the question 1 can be sought out from two study analysis (Douze, 1964; Bormann, \n\n2012) carried out with seismic noise and earthquake recording analysis done with sensors \n\ninstalled both at the surface and in the boreholes at different depth levels. The surface-wave \n\nnature of seismic noise is the reason for the exponential decay of noise amplitudes with depth, \n\nwhich is not the case for body waves (Fig.2.1). Douze (1964) analyzed the noise measurement in \n\nan abandoned oil well at the surface and at different depths with a vertical short period \n\nseismometer. The ratio of Fourier spectral amplitude at depth over the surface spectral amplitude \n\nratio decreased significantly at 0.25-3 s period (Fig.2.1), which suggests the surface wave \n\ndominancy of noise wavefield. Above the 3s period, the ratio of spectral amplitude for depth to  \n\nsurface are nearly 1, which suggests that for those frequencies decay should occur at higher \n\ndepth (Fig.2.1). Another study (Bormann, 2012) performed with the same propose to check the \n\nnature of noise wavefield was done with recording at the surface and depth (Fig 2.2). \n\n \n\nFig.2. 1Deep-to-surface noise Fourier spectra amplitude ratio (vertical component) as a function of period  (taken \n\nfrom.  Douze, 1964). \n\n \nFig.2. 2 Recording of seismic noise (left) and earthquake signals (right) at the surface and at different depth levels of \n\na borehole (from Bormann 2012). \n\nSimilarly, the penetration depth of surface waves increases with wavelength and high-frequency \n\nnoise attenuates more rapidly with depth. In the case of (Fig.2.3) the noise power at 300m depth \n\nin a borehole was reduced, as compared to the surface, by about 10 dB at f = 0.5 Hz, 20 dB at 1 \n\n\n\n \n \n\n8 \n \n\nHz and 35 dB at 10 Hz. This continuous amplitude decline with frequency is in accordance with \n\nthe surface waves nature of seismic noise. However, the noise amplitude drop, as well as the \n\nsignal behavior, with depth and it also depended on the local geological conditions. Withers et al. \n\n(1996) found that for frequencies between 10 to 20 Hz, the SNR (signal to noise ratio) could be \n\nimproved between 10 to 20 dB and for frequencies between 23 and 55 Hz as much as 20 to 40 \n\ndB by deploying a short-period sensor at only 45m below the surface. \n\n \n\nFig.2. 3 Velocity power density spectra as obtained for noise records at the surface (top) and at 300 m depth in a \n\nborehole (below) near Gorleben, Germany (taken from Bormann, 2012) \n\nTo deal with the second question, some empirical studies were done seeking to find the fraction \n\nenergy of the Rayleigh and Love waves in noise field. As early as 1980, most of the researchers \n\nfocused their attention to find the fraction of Rayleigh to Love ratio from the analysis of noise \n\nwavefield recorded on vertical component (Li et al., 1984; Horike, 1985; Yamanaka et al., 1994). \n\nThe results of these studies showed an agreement in one aspect that microseism (<1Hz) are \n\nmainly dominated by Rayleigh waves, and at high frequency (> 1Hz) a combination of Love and \n\nRayleigh waves exists. However, two other studies (Arai et al., 1998 and Yamamoto, 2000) \n\nperformed on the same subject have shown very unclear results about the fraction of Rayleigh-\n\nto-Love waves (see for example Table 2.2). The outcome of their analysis is that at \n\nanthropogenic region (urban site) the fraction of Love energy is more than Rayleigh energy \n\n(Table 2.2). \n\n Rayleigh waves(%) Love waves(%) Frequency range(%) \n\nChouet et al.,1998 30% 70% >2Hz \n\nYamamoto, 2000&lt;50% >50% 3-10 Hz \n\nArai et al., 1998 30% 70% 1-12 Hz \n\nCornou, 2002 60% 40% &lt;1 Hz \n\nOkada (2003)         &lt;50%        >=50%         0.4-1 HZ \n\n1.

Arai and \n\nTokimatsu (1998, 2000) tried to find the comparative fraction of  Rayleigh and Love waves and \n\nthis fraction dependence on frequency from 3-c sensor array analysis for four sites in Japan A: \n\nYumenoshima (Tokyo), B: Rokko Island (Kobe), C: Asahi (Kushiro), D: Kotobuki (Kushiro). \n\nThey applied both the frequency-wave-number (F-K) and spatial auto-correlation method \n\n(SPAC) approach (Fig.2.4). The ratio of (Rayleigh/Love)FK and (Rayleigh/Love)SPAC  is 0.4 to 1 \n\nfor the period 0.1-5 s. The fraction of the ratio is concluded to be 0.7 (0.41/0.59). Hence, for \n\nfrequencies higher than 1 Hz (cultural noise), the noise wavefields consists around 60% Love \n\nwaves and 40% Rayleigh waves in that area. Another study done by Cornou (2002) showed from \n\nthe 3-c array data analysis that the energy ratio for each radial and transverse component is \n\naround 50% each. She estimated that the proportion of energy carried by Rayleigh waves \n\nthrough the ratio of the energy carried by radial and transverse components is around 50% of \n\nRayleigh waves for frequency range from 0.2 to 1 Hz. \n\n \n\n \nFig.2. 4 Rayleigh to Love waves fraction for four sites, from 3-c array data for FK (a) and for SAC (b) analysis  \n\n(Arai and Tokimatsu, 1998). \n\nAbout the third question, the actual energy distribution for various modes of Rayleigh waves is \n\nalmost impossible to predict due to the heterogeneous ground conditions (Bonnefoy-Claudet et \n\nal., 2006). The Rayleigh wave higher modes existences in the seismic noise wavefield are not \n\nvery well investigated. Indirect information of Rayleigh wave higher modes dominancy can be \n\nachieved from the Horizontal-over-Vertical spectral ratio (H/V) method. Yamanka et al. (1994) \n\nperformed a study with continuous noise recording in Japan (Kanto plain). They observed that \n\nH/V closely match with the fundamental mode of Rayleigh wave ellipticity, which lead them to \n\n\n\n \n \n\n10 \n \n\nconclude that noise wavefield is dominated by fundamental mode of  Rayleigh waves. Two other \n\nstudies, Stephenson (2003) and Konno &amp; Ohmachi (1998) concluded that if the noise wavefield \n\nis dominated by fundamental mode of Rayleigh wave then the H/V curve should have a clear \n\npeak and trough for the site. \n\nTokimatsu (1997) analyzed the Rayleigh wave displacement equation for synthetic noise at a \n\nsimple model (horizontal layered, elastic and homogeneous medium over a half space), \n\ntheoretical dispersion curve was estimated for the model. He characterized the model by 3 \n\ndifferent S-wave velocity profiles for different stiffness values with depth, stiffness changing \n\nregularly (increases and decreases cases Fig. 2.5 a). Tokimatsu observed that in case 2 and case 3 \n\nthe computed dispersion curve (obtained from synthetic noise) does not perfectly match the \n\ntheoretical one for fundamental mode, however in case 1 (increasing velocity with depth), the \n\ntheoretical and computed curves for the model match very reasonable. He observed that one \n\nhigher mode or multiple higher modes played a significant role in various frequency ranges. \n\nHence, depending on the geological characteristics of the soil (especially due to the presence of \n\nvelocity inversions at depth) higher modes can be excited in seismic noise (if mainly made of \n\nsurface wave). \n\n \n\n \nFig.2. 5(a) Velocity profiles used by Tokimatsu (1997) to compute Rayleigh waves dispersion curves numerically. \n\nThe corresponding dispersion curves (dots) computed from noise synthetics in case 1 (b), case 2 (c) and case 3 (d) \n\nare compared with theoretical disperion curves of higher mode Rayleigh waves (after Tokimatsu 1997). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n11 \n \n\n2.4 Techniques used for seismic noise \n \n\nThe seismic noise wavefield is utilized for different purposes at different levels. The first real \n\ntechniques, which were developed for the seismic noise analysis, are array analysis like Spatial \n\nAutocorrelation (SPAC), Aki (1957-1965), and the frequency-wavenumber analysis technique, \n\nF-K, (Capon et al., 1967-1969). We can also cite the single 3 component method introduced by \n\nNogoshi &amp; Igrashi (1971) to estimate the site effect properties for the mechanical vibration like \n\nan earthquake, and very recently, the Green function is used for the same purpose of the site \n\neffect fundamental period and shear wave velocity estimation (Sanche Sesma, 2011; Pina Flores, \n\n2017). We briefly explain the F-K and SPAC in coming section. In seismology, a 2D array \n\n(SPAC and F-K method) of seismic sensors is used to capture the full wave field for the velocity \n\nand azimuth information retrieval at an investigated site. 1D array of sensors only records the \n\nwave field that is on the direction of the array line while fail to capture both the velocity and \n\nazimuth information. To resolve the azimuth, the horizontal component of the wave field should \n\nbe properly resolved. For each array technique, the basic principle is to find the arrival delay at \n\neach station for an incident wavefront. Each wavefront reaches different sensors at a different \n\ntime. From this time delay, the slowness or the velocity information are obtained. In the case of \n\nvertically incident wavefield, a 2D array will record the apparent velocity or slowness and this \n\napparent velocity is strongly affected by the incidence angle from the vertical. Therefore, a 3D \n\narray is needed to capture the velocity, azimuth and incidence angle information. This 3D array \n\nis usually achieved by installing sensors in a borehole at a depth equivalent to the length of the \n\n2D array on the surface. To the surface wave (both Love and Rayleigh waves) that travels along \n\nthe horizontal direction, a 2D array is sufficient to analyzed surface waves. \n\n2.4.1 Spatial autocorrelation (SPAC) method \n\nSPAC method was developed by Aki (1957, 1965) for seismic noise analysis which helps in \n\ncharacterizing the nature of the noise wavefield and wave propagation characteristics of a site. \n\nAki considered the seismic noise wave as a stationary and random process both in time and \n\nspace. Hence, two further assumptions are made that the wave field is made of superimposed \n\nisotropic waves propagating with same phase velocities for certain frequency, but with different \n\npowers in all directions, in a horizontal plane. The second assumption is that waves with \n\ndifferent frequencies and propagation directions are independents. Taken all these assumptions \n\ninto consideration the spatial correlation of ground motion at two location u(a,t) and u(b,t) is \n\ngiven by Aki (1957) as: \n\n                                          (2.1) \n\n \n\nHere          is the recorded signal at location (a,b), t is time,   is azimuth and r is the \n\ndistance. The time and space spectrum relation for a wavefront of single mode traveling along \n\nthe azimuth   is given as: \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n12 \n \n\n       \n \n\n \n         \n\n  \n\n    \n         \n\n \n\n \n        (2.2) \n\n \n\n     is the power spectrum of the wave in time,      is the phase velocity,   is the angular \n\nfrequency. A power spectrum term,     , which can be filtered with band filter at a central \n\nfrequency    is given as: \n\n \n\n                           (2.3) \n\n \n\nwhere      is spectral power density,   is dirac function. Using these values in Eq.2.2 result as: \n\n \n\n          \n \n\n \n          \n\n   \n\n     \n               (2.4) \n\n \n\nThis spatial correlation in Eq.2.4 is normalized by the autocorrelation of a central station and a \n\nnew spatial correlation is given as: \n\n  \n\n          \n         \n\n         \n         (2.5) \n\n \n\nupon putting its value will reduce Eq.2.5 to \n\n  \n\n              \n   \n\n     \n                             (2.6) \n\n \n\nIn Eq.2.6 \n \n\n     \n                   shows the time delay between different sensors. The \n\nshape of spatial-correlation function,  , can easily sketch the wave propagation direction \n\n(Fig2.6). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n13 \n \n\n \nFig.2. 6 The shape of the spatial correlation function. The function shows a constant value and abruptly decreases \n\nwith increase in frequency in the propagation direction (from Okada 2003). \n\n \n\nFor experimental point of view, Aki (1957) suggested to use a circular array of radius r and \n\ninstall the station at regular space with respect to the central station (Fig.2.7). \n\n \nFig.2. 7 Diagram of a circular array with an incident plane wave arriving under an azimuth angle (from Hobiger \n\n2011). \n\nThe function for this circular array is azimuthally average  as \n\n \n\n   \n \n\n \n         \n\n \n\n \n         (2.7) \n\n \n\nand in more general form Okada (2003) expressed Eq.2.7 as \n\n\n\n \n \n\n14 \n \n\n  \n\n    \n \n\n \n          \n\n  \n\n    \n         \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n         (2.8) \n\n \n\nthe term in Eq.2.8      \n  \n\n    \n         \n\n \n\n \n   is the Bessel function first kind of zero order   . \n\nThen Eq.2.8 can reduced to \n\n \n\n    \n \n\n \n        \n\n  \n\n    \n \n\n \n\n \n          (2.9) \n\n \n\nSimilar like Eq.2.5 the normalized spatial correlation function is given as  \n\n \n\n           \n   \n\n     \n         (2.10) \n\n \n\nThis derivation is detailed in Aki (1957).  Eq.2.10 provides a way to compute the phase velocity \n\nwhen the average of the spatial-correlation function is made for fixed r. Naturally, if data \n\nrecorded on several circles with different radio are available, an azimuthally average can be \n\ncomputed for each circle, and for a fixed frequency f, using r as the independent variable \n\n(Chavez-Garcia,2005). This Eq.2.10 provides a dispersion curve which can be inverted to obtain \n\nthe ground structure. \n\n2.4.2 Frequency-wavenumber analysis \n\nFrequency wave number method was developed by Capon et al. (1967) and Lacoss et al. (1969). \n\nThis method was initially developed to detect nuclear explosion using seismic network LASA \n\n(large aperture seismic array) which has a diameter of 200 km (Okada 2003). This helps out to \n\nsingle out a predominant seismic wave from a mixture of other waves disregarding its nature. \n\nThis method works for both body and surface wave analysis. Applying to the surface wave \n\nanalysis, in the case of seismic noise, the main assumption is made that wave field is dominated \n\nby surface waves. \n\nTo describe the kernel of this procedure let assumed a single incident plane wave arriving at N \n\nsensors with its position as  and the corresponding slowness vector for delay arrival at all sensors \n\nis given as product of slowness vector with the positions vector within array. The first sensor \n\nposition of the array system is considered as the origin. In this situation, the recording for a \n\nsingle-component for all the sensors is given as: \n\n            \n                 \n\n \n\n \n       (2.11) \n\n \n\nwhere      is wave complex amplitude (frequency dependant). The signal vector of the array \n\ncan be define as  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n15 \n \n\n       \n\n  \n  \n \n\n  \n\n =               \n       \n\n \n\n \n      (2.12) \n\n \n\nWhere, in 2.12, R are the sensors locations given as a matrix (the size of R is N 3). By taking \n\nthe Fourier transform of signal vector yield as: \n\n \n\n     \n \n\n   \n            \n\n        \n             \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n   \n\n \n \n\n   \n            \n\n     \n    \n\n \n\n  \n\n       \n        \n\n \n\n  \n\n   \n\n \n \n\n   \n            \n\n     \n    \n\n \n\n  \n\n           \n\n \n \n\n   \n                       (2.13) \n\nif \n    \n\n   \n       is the origin sensor Fourier transform and the wave vector is given as       \n\n         then 2.13 reduced to  \n\n \n\n           \n               (2.14) \n\n \n\n     is multiplied by a steering vector                   which takes all the element of \n\n     in phase and then sum it. \n\nApplication of seismic noise           energy is estimated as: \n\n \n\n                         (2.15) \n\n \n\n        \n        \n\n \n\n  \n       \n\n \n\n       (2.16) \n\n \n\n        \n  \n\n \n\n \n                     \n\n \n\n        \n =           (2.17) \n\n \n\nA grid search is performed for all values of k and trying to recognize the maximum energy  for a \n\ncorrect wave vector . The second term in 2.17 is known as an array response function which \n\ncorresponds to a zero vector incident wave or, more simply, the wave is arriving at an incident \n\nangle of zero which corresponds to infinite velocity. Frequency wave number method \n\ncharacterized the seismic noise wave field by determining the apparent velocity and direction of \n\nmaximum propagating waves. FK method is used mainly to determine the Rayleigh wave \n\ndispersion curve with vertical seismic sensors because  in 3 component sensors case, horizontal \n\n\n\n \n \n\n16 \n \n\ncomponent requires a rotation for radial and tranverse component which is not an easy task \n\n(Lacoss et al., 1969 Fah et al 2008). There is one other technique that uses seismic noise for site \n\ninvestigation. It is the H/V spectral curve technique. The H/V will be explained in detail in \n\nseparate chapters (chapter 3). \n\nThere is a variety of seismic noise application ranging for environmental applications to \n\nearthquake engineering and oil and gas exploration. The most common techniques utilized for \n\nthese purposes are a single sensor and the array techniques. The main feature of seismic noise, on \n\nwhich most of these techniques are based, is the spectral analysis of seismic noise and its \n\nvariation both in space and time.   \n\nFor the environmental studies, the main application of seismic noise is its use for the \n\nenvironmental monitoring. The global climate changes and tried to observe the temporal \n\nvariation of seismic noise (Grevemeyer, 2000; Aster et al., 2008), as one of the main sources of \n\nseismic noise are an ocean related process like ocean swell and tides, and all these processes are \n\ndirectly related to the climatic condition. The change in global climate is observed with the \n\ntemporal variation of continuous seismic noise recording. Gross et al. (2009) utilized seismic \n\nnoise for local and regional scale metrological variation like air pressure and wind speed \n\nchanges. Burtin et al. (2008) analyzed seismic noise spectral amplitude variation with time and \n\nspace to observe the hydrodynamics of the river to its transported bedload. The use of seismic \n\nnoise for seismic interferometry is another important application. This interferometric study is \n\nperformed by measuring the Green function from the cross-correlation of coherent wave field \n\nbetween any two receivers of seismic noise recording and trying to observe its variation with \n\ntime. This approach is used for the analysis of seismic velocities changes at fault zones \n\n(Brenguier et al., 2008b) and at volcanoes sites (Brenguier et al., 2008a). The cross-correlation of \n\nthe seismic noise recording converges to Green function when the seismic noise wavefield is \n\nassumed to be equipartitioned (equal contribution of surface and body waves) (Gou\u00e9dard et al., \n\n2008a).  \n\n \n\nIn earthquake engineering, seismic noise is often used to analyze the site based specific \n\nproperties like shear wave velocity, which is the most important parameter in microzonation for \n\nearthquake hazard mitigation. The other applications are an estimative guess of the thickness of \n\nsoil package, the direction of maximum slope inland sliding prone areas and site based vibration \n\namplification. The retrieval of the 1D shear wave velocity profile with depth are achieved \n\nthrough array techniques like SPAC, multi-channel analysis of surface waves (MASW), spectral \n\nanalysis of surface wave (SASW) and frequency-wavenumber (FK) method. In all these \n\nmethods, dispersion curves are obtained and later, they are inverted to obtained the S-wave \n\nvelocity profile. H/V is another very important technique used to study the frequencies around,  \n\nthe maximum amplification of the bedrock motion is expected to occur at a local site (will be \n\ndiscussed in detail in next chapter). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n17 \n \n\nThe most commercialized application of seismic noise is its utilization in the hydrocarbon \n\nindustry. Some studies have shown the possibility of using seismic noise analysis as direct \n\nhydrocarbon indicator (DHI) for hydrocarbon reservoir (Mohammed et al., 2007). It is observed \n\nthat within the frequency ranges of 1 to 4 Hz, the H/V ratio and spectral amplitude of recorded \n\nseismic noise changes with the presence of hydrocarbon reservoir in the subsurface.  However, \n\nthere is no univocal agreement among the researcher for this specific usage. A study over the \n\nhydrocarbon reservoir concluded that the variation in H/V and spectral amplitude variation at the \n\nsite are more affected by seismic noise produced by local sources like hydrocarbon exploitation \n\nactivity and not as DHI (Hanssen &amp; Bussat 2008). However, this seems a very interesting \n\napplication and may need further study for the detailed insight. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n18 \n \n\nChapter 3:  Review of the H/V spectral curve method \n \n\nH/V (horizontal-to-vertical) spectral ratio is a fast way to characterize a site for engineering \n\napplication from the ambient noise measurement with a single 3-component sensor on the Earth \n\nsurface. The method is used for a rapid estimation of fundamental resonance frequency  of a site \n\naround which the maximum displacement amplification is expected to occur in case of shakes \n\ninduced by an earthquake. The technique can be summarized as: a three-component sensor \n\n(seismometer) used to record the ground motion induced by natural seismic noise. The Fourier \n\nspectra of all the three (east-west, north-south and vertical) components are find out. The \n\nhorizontal (east-west, north-south) components are averaged out and divided by the vertical one. \n\n  \n\n        \n             \n\n      \n        (3.1) \n\n \n\nwhere        is the Fourier amplitude spectra of the vertical  motion and        and        \n\nare the spectra of two horizontal components at frequency  . Both the horizontal components are \n\naveraged either by geometrical mean or quadratic mean. \n\n \n\nThis spectral amplitude ratio (Eq.3.1) is plotted as a function of frequency which usually results \n\nin a peak (depending on the subsurface configuration). This peak corresponds to the S-wave \n\nresonance frequency of the site. The shear wave resonance frequency within a layer of thickness \n\nh is one-quarter of the wavelength of shear wave within the layer (Mooney et al 1966; \n\nMalischewsky &amp; Sherbaum, 2004). This peak of the H/V curve is used extensively for the site \n\neffect characterization and for quick estimation of its fundamental resonance (Sing, 2014-2015 \n\nand 2017; Shokry, 2016). The advantage of this method is that it can be used in the areas where \n\nthe earthquake seismic activity is not so frequent, in such case, the recording of the seismic noise \n\nachieved the required goal. \n\nHere, in this chapter, it will be given the historical overview of the method. And later a brief \n\noutline of the H/V formula derived by Malischewsky &amp; Sherbaum (2004) from the wave \n\nequation for homogeneous half space and a layer over half space situation, following by the \n\nprocessing of seismic noise from the SESAME (2004) recommendations to get the reliable H/V \n\ncurve. \n\n3.1 Historical overview of the H/V curve \n\nKanai and Tanaka (1961) were the first researchers to use the seismic noise horizontal \n\ncomponent Fourier spectra for the subsurface characterization. Their conclusion was that seismic \n\nnatural noise properties depend both on the mechanical properties of a site and sources of \n\nseismic noise. Later, Nogoshi and Igarashi (1971) used the horizontal over vertical spectral ratio \n\n\n\n \n \n\n19 \n \n\nto infer the site properties, however, their work was published in Japanese so the rest of the \n\nscientific community did not notice it. This method was familiarized by Nakamura in 1989, \n\nwhich is actually the reason that some of the researchers called it Nakamura method. \n\nThe H/V curve methods are extensively used for various purposes. Harutoonian (2012) used it \n\nfor the soil compaction evaluation. Stankoe et al. (2017) showed that directional analysis of the \n\nH/V might provide the link to the presence of near subsurface faults. Mohammed et al. (2007) \n\nand Saenger et al. (2009) used this method to link it to the presence of hydrocarbon within the \n\nsubsurface. Though all these applications of the H/V spectral curve seem very intriguing, the \n\nmost commonly adopted application of the H/V curve is its utilization for the near subsurface \n\ncharacterization. The H/V curve is used very extensively to retrieve 1D shear wave velocity \n\nprofile by the joint inversion with the dispersion curve (Scherbaum et al., 2003, Arai &amp; \n\nTokimatsu 2004, Parolai et al., 2005, Piccozi et al., 2005 and Hobiger et al., 2013). Scherbaum et \n\nal. (2003) showed that dispersion curve inversion can be improved by the inclusion of the peak \n\nof the H/V curve for deeper soil deposit. Arai &amp; Tokimatsu (2004) showed that thickness of the \n\nsoft sediments can be retrieved if the absolute shear wave velocity of the site is known in \n\npriority. Parolai et al. (2005) showed a very similar result that dispersion and Rayleigh wave \n\nellipticity have a different sensitivity to the soil layers.  \n\nThe two most important features of the H/V curve often used for the near-subsurface application \n\nis the peak and the shape of the curve. The peak frequency is used for the fundamental resonance \n\nfrequency, thickness and the average shear wave velocity estimation of the soil package, while \n\nthe shape of the H/V curve, along with some supplementary information, is utilized for the shear \n\nwave velocity profile retrieval through inversion. In this study, we are going to investigate the \n\naspect of joint inversion of the H/V and dispersion curves which have not been evaluated in \n\ndetail yet (discussed in objectives and summary of the thesis in detail). For example, it is usually \n\nwhispered that the peak of H/V provides a good estimative of shear wave resonance frequency \n\neven when H/V curve is considered as proxy for the Rayleigh wave ellipticity. If this is the case, \n\nwe will try to check the deviation between shear wave resonance frequency from the H/V peak \n\nfrequency by forward modeling. \n\n3.2  Formula of the H/V curve  \n\n \n\nThe first attempt to model and formulate the H/V curve mathematically was made by \n\nMalischewsky et al., (2004, 2008). Malischewsky tried to explicitly derive a formula for the H/V \n\ncurve from the wave equation, for the Rayleigh wave traveling through different situations like \n\nin homogeneous half-space, and a layer of thickness d over the half-space. The complete \n\nalgebraic derivation of the formula is lengthy, especially for a layer over the half-space, and can \n\nbe found in Malischewsky et a.l (2004). Here it will be listed briefly. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n20 \n \n\nThe propagation of Rayleigh wave along homogeneous and inhomogeneous surfaces of half \n\nspace is a well-understood phenomenon. The displacement of particles under the influence of \n\nRayleigh waves has two orthogonal components, one horizontal along the direction of \n\npropagation while the other component is directed downward along the depth axis. The ratio of \n\nthese two displacements eigenfunctions at the surface of homogeneous or inhomogeneous half-\n\nspace is termed as ellipticity of Rayleigh wave. The shape of the ellipticity is linked to an elastic \n\nparameter of the subsurface and it is therefore considered an important parameter for engineering \n\nproblems.  \n\nTo derive the formula of the H/V for the homogenous half-space we are using the notation of \n\nMalischewsky et al. (2004, 2008). Consider a homogeneous half-space in a Cartesian coordinate \n\nsystem, where the origin of a two-dimensional Rayleigh wave motion is located on the surface of \n\nhalf space. The wave motion direction assumed is from left to right, the horizontal displacement \n\nin the x-direction is given by x1, while vertical component of displacement x3 is directed into the \n\nhalf-space (z-direction). The displacement ui in case of no-body forces for homogenous, elastic \n\nand isotropic medium can be characterized by Lame parameter     and density   as   \n\n \n    \n\n      \n        \n\n    \n\n      \n          (3.2) \n\n \n\nwhere    denotes double derivative with respect to time.

As discussed above, a \n\nthree-component sensor is used to record the seismic ambient noise placed on the surface of the \n\nEarth at an investigated site. The type of sensor generally recommended is a short period sensor, \n\nas broadband sensor requires a large time for stabilization prior to the effective recording. The \n\naccelerometer is not recommended for the noise measurement as its response below 1 Hz is very \n\nunstable. If the investigated site has an expected frequency lower than the natural frequency of \n\nthe short period sensor, the result might not be reliable. In such cases, a sensor with lower natural \n\nfrequency is recommended for the larger duration. The recommendations for the experimental \n\nrecording and processing procedure were firstly suggested by Mucciarelli (1998) and Bard \n\n(1999), later SESAME (Site EffectS assessment using AMbient Excitations 2004) refined the \n\nrecording and processing protocol in a comprehensive way. Similarly, another reliability \n\nclassification scheme was developed later by Albarello et al. (2011) to quality check the recorded \n\nnoise data. This new classification includes some additional recommendations to that proposed \n\nby the SESAME. The data recorded with the three-component sensor is processed initially such \n\nas \n\n1. Offset removal-means that the whole signal is deducted from the each sample; \n\n2. The signal is divided into a number of windows            , whose length is chosen such \n\nthat the window must have 10 significant cycles for the frequency of interest    \n  \n\n  \n ,    is the \n\nexpected fundamental frequency of the site,    is the length of time window in seconds. The \n\nstable portion of the signal is chosen with the help of short time average (STA) and long time \n\naverage (LTA), this helps to avoid choosing the transient portion of the signal. The following \n\nsteps of the process are applied to the selected windows, as recommended by SESAME 2004: \n\n(a) for all the components Vertical, North-South and East-West, a cosine taper of 5% is applied \n\nat each end of the window; \n\n(b) FFT is performed for each window of all the three components and the spectral amplitudes \n\nare estimated at each frequency (0.2 to 20 Hz); \n\n(c) the spectral of each component are smoothened by the Kohno and Ohmachi (1998) \n\nsmoothing function of bandwidth 30; \n\n\n\n \n \n\n26 \n \n\n(d) both the horizontal components (NS and EW) are averaged by quadratic, which means \n\n                      \n        \n\n          \n \n\n \n        (3.21) \n\n(e) the merged horizontal component is divided by the vertical component for each frequency to \n\nobtain the H/V ratio amplitude. The H/V ratio amplitude is plotted as a function of frequency as \n\nshown in Fig 3.4 (Note: a sufficient number of windows are required for the good statistical \n\ncontrol for all the process steps from (a) to (e). In each of the n windows the log of ratio of \n\nspectral amplitudes for merged horizontal and vertical is obtained as function of frequency); \n\n3. The mean H/V ratio is obtained from all the windows selected by \n\n                   \n   \n\n \n           \n\n          \n        (3.22) \n\n(Average standard deviation is estimated by the relation) \n\n \n\n                 \n      \n\n \n                      \n\n \n        \n\n            \n      (3.23) \n\n \n\nAfter this initial processing, a statistical analysis is performed to check the reliability of the H/V \n\ncurve and peak clarity condition as suggested by SESAME (2004). The reliability criteria for the \n\nH/V curve were found (Fig 3.4e) which shows that whether the curve obtained with the analyzed \n\nrecorded noise is the true representative of the site and another seismic noise record at the site \n\nwill result in the same curve or not. By satisfying SESAME (2004) reliability conditions for H/V \n\ncurve, the next stage is to pick the peak of it. It is essential to remember that the most important \n\napplication of the H/V curve is its correct peak identification which corresponds to the shear \n\nwave resonance frequency for higher velocity contrast between soil and bedrock. Therefore, it is \n\nof great interest to pick the correct peak of the H/V curve. In most of the cases, when a high-\n\nvelocity contrast exists at the subsurface, the picking of the peak frequency is quite easy and \n\nstraightforward. However, sometimes there exists two velocity contrasts or an increasing \n\ngradient of velocity from the surface to the rock for which the H/V results in two or a broad \n\npeak, respectively. Therefore, to pick the peak of H/V curve, which should be closer to the shear \n\nresonance frequency, is quite tricky in both cases. Consequently, some criteria to clarity the peak \n\nare suggested to ensure the picking of the correct peak (Fig 3.4f, SESAME, 2004). The terms \n\nappearing in Fig.3.4e-f are given in Table 3.1 with its short definition. With the help of these \n\ncriteria for the curve and peak, the margin of mistake of picking a wrong peak is very little. \n\nTo obtain the H/V curve, the Geopsy free package is a good tool, however the problem with \n\nGeopsy is that the SESAME (2004) criteria are not implemented there yet. For this purpose, we \n\n\n\n \n \n\n27 \n \n\nanalyzed our recorded noise data with Matlab, where the conditions for the reliability of the \n\ncurve and peak can be easily implemented. \n\n \n\n \nFig.3. 4 Shows one-hour seismic ambient noise record at IAG site: (a) shows the windows (each of 50 sec) selected \n\nfor the H/V analysis; (b) shows the smoothed spectral amplitude of all the three components; (c) the average H/V \n\ncurves of all the 64 windows (upper lower limit indicates the 95% confidence interval around mean H/V curve \n\nvalues); (e-f) show the criteria of reliable H/V curve and reliability of clear peak, SESAME 2004. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n28 \n \n\n \n\nTable.3. 1 The definition of terms appeared in Fig.3.4 (e-f) (SESAME 2004).  \n\nFrequency \n\nrange [Hz] \n\n &lt;0.2 0.2 \u2013 0.5 0.5 \u2013 1.0 1.0 \u2013 2.0 > 2.0 \n\n??(f0) [Hz] 0.25 f0 0.20 f0 0.15 f0 0.10 f0 0.05 f0 \n\n??(f?) for  A \n(f0)?\n\n3.0 2.5 2.0 1.78 1.58 \n\nTable.3. 2 : Shows the threshold values for stability conditions. \n\nAs we will use the H/V curve, later, in this thesis for the inversion process, some additional \n\ncriteria are implemented along with ones suggested by the SESAME (2004) for more robust H/V \n\ncurve results. Albarello et al., (2011) defined the quality of seismic noise recorded data and the \n\nH/V curve in terms of three different classes, as: class A, trustworthy and interpretable H/V \n\ncurve, it represents a reference measurement that can be considered by itself for the site of \n\nconcern; class B, ambiguous H/V curve, that should be used with caution and in case of \n\ncoherency with other measurements performed nearby; class C, poor quality H/V curve (hardly \n\ninterpretable), to be discarded. The criteria used to classify measurements of class A are: \n\n1. The duration of the noise record: the duration of the analyzed record should be more than 15 \n\nminutes (we choose 1 hour in our case, Fig. 3.4 (a)) \n\n2.

The statistical robustness: SESAME (2004) criteria \u201cfor a reliable H/V curve and peak\u201d should \n\nbe fulfilled, Fig. 3.4(e-f). \n\nA measurement belongs to class B if one or more of the previous conditions are not fulfilled. \n\nClass B measurements degrade to class C if: a rising drift exists from low to high frequencies \n\nthat indicate a tilting of the instrument. \n\nA new aspect of the H/V curve method, but not analyzed in detail, is to find the directivity effect \n\nof the H/V curve. The directivity effect of the H/V is trying to evaluate its links either with the \n\nsubsurface geology or with the arrangement of local seismic noise sources. For this analysis the \n\nseismic noise recorded at the IAG and IGC sites were analyzed. The horizontal (east-west and \n\nnorth-south) components of the seismic noise are rotated, merged and its ratio is found with the \n\nvertical component. The amplitude of the H/V along with azimuth            is found. The \n\nH/V amplitude with azimuth             is similar because of the symmetry. The amplitude \n\nof the H/V between           decreased, which shows the less energetic arrival of seismic \n\nenergy from this azimuth. However, a river and heavy traffic road presence, on both sides of the \n\nriver, in the same azimuth suggest that the arriving seismic energy from this azimuth should be \n\nhigher, which is not the case (Fig.3.6, page 30). To observe the direction of this low-energetic \n\nseismic noise sources distribution (           we map the locations where the noise recording \n\nare made along with its surrounding. It is shown in Fig.3.7. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n30 \n \n\n  \n\nFig.3. 6 Shows the spectrogram of the three component, both the horizontal components show stationarity at 2 Hz \n\nfor all the seismic noise record. \n\n \n\nWe found no such clear source of noise generation in this predominant direction as most of \n\nurbanized part of the city surrounding the recording sites is almost equally (Fig 3.7). We believe \n\nthis directivity is related to some subsurface characteristics rather than the distribution of noise \n\nsources around the recording sites. This will be investigated, later, in detail, for now, we \n\ncompared the results of the two recording sites which are made in close proximity and tried to \n\nlink the directivity effects for both sites for the whole length of its noise recording (Fig. 3.8 &amp; \n\nFig 3.9), which shows a similar trend. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig.3. 7 Shows the arrangement of urbanization around the recording (taken from Google earth.

Actually, there are two approaches to measuring these properties, \n\none in the laboratory and the other in the field. The laboratory approach is to study the soil \n\nsample effect on different parameters of variation in a controlled environment (Kramer, 1996). \n\nThe in situ (field) measurement has the benefit of studying the soil properties in its natural \n\nundisturbed state. Another advantage of in situ measurement is that a large area can be covered \n\nby this analysis. For the stiffness measurement in the field, many methods are employed. Among \n\nof these methods, the best one is the drilling method (downhole logging). Also, there are some \n\nmethods which are used to estimate the stiffness of the soil regarding to the penetration \n\nresistance, such as cone penetration test (CPT) and standard penetration test (SPT). These \n\nmethods provide excellent results; however, they are very expensive and time-consuming. The \n\nsolution for this time consuming and cost effectiveness is the surface wave analysis. In the \n\nsurface wave method, the earth is considered as a layered medium for which the shear wave \n\nvelocity profile is obtained as a function of depth. The stiffness of a layer can be found from the \n\nshear wave velocity of the layer. The stiffness and shear wave velocity are directly related \n\n(Kramer, 1996). Rayleigh and Love waves are used to obtain the dispersion curve, which later \n\nare inverted to deduce the shear wave velocity profile of the soil. We will try to focus our \n\nattention on the surface wave analysis method used for the dispersion curve retrieval from the \n\nRayleigh wave, and latter jointly, we will latter invert this phase velocity dispersion curve with \n\nRayleigh ellipticity curve. \n\nRayleigh waves are dispersive in inelastic, isotropic and vertically heterogeneous material. The \n\ndispersion curve obtained for the Rayleigh waves provides information regarding the shear wave \n\nvelocity, which in turn, it can be used for the stiffness measurement. Rayleigh wave\u2019s dispersion \n\ncurve is a function of frequency, which means that different frequencies travel with different \n\nphase velocities. Rayleigh waves phase velocity is a complicated function of the shear wave \n\nvelocity Vs, thickness h, primary wave velocity Vp and density ? of soil layers. There are many \n\nmethods used to retrieve Rayleigh wave\u2019s dispersion curve. Among these, the most popular for \n\nthe active source case are SASW (spectral analysis of surface waves) and MASW (multi-channel \n\nanalysis of surface waves) (Park et al., 1999). The MASW is widely used for the shear wave \n\nvelocity estimation of a site for geophysical and engineering projects (Xia 2014).  Xia et al. \n\n(2002) showed that the deviation between borehole and MASW result is only 15%. We will \n\ndiscuss the MASW method in detail but, before that, let's focus on some related features of \n\nRayleigh waves. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n33 \n \n\nRayleigh waves are made from the interaction of P and Sv waves along the surface of the Earth \n\n(the interface between two media). The particle motion induced by Rayleigh waves has two \n\ncomponents, horizontal and vertical. This interaction of vertical and horizontal components \n\nproduce particle motion retrograde (anticlockwise) or prograde (clockwise), depending on the \n\ntheoretical phase shift (?\n \n\n \n) between the two respective components. The particle motion induced \n\nby Rayleigh waves varies with depth. Being retrograde at the surface and become prograde at \n\ngreater depth. The Rayleigh waves are non-dispersive in homogeneous half space, however, they \n\nare dispersive in vertically heterogeneous materials (by dispersion it means, waves with different \n\nwavelengths travel with different velocities). A vibrating seismic source at the surface of a \n\nhomogeneous elastic half-space produced, the energy whose 67% of its fraction is imparted to \n\nRayleigh waves, 26% to S-waves and 7% to P-waves (Wood, 1968). When the waves travel \n\naway from the seismic source as a hemispherical wavefront, it encounters a larger area of \n\nmaterial, the amplitude of the waves decrease, which is known as geometrical spreading or \n\ngeometrical damping. The amplitude of Rayleigh waves decreases in elastic and homogeneous \n\nhalf space as      , where r is the distance from the source. The body waves amplitude decrease \n\nin respective situation as     along the surface and     in the medium. As Rayleigh decay \n\nslower in comparison to body waves and 67% of energy is imparted to Rayleigh waves, the wave \n\nfield is dominated by Rayleigh waves at very short distances from the impact source (Richard et \n\nal., 1970). The Rayleigh waves phase velocity curve (dispersion) are multimodal, which means \n\nthat, each frequency component might have different propagation velocity. The curve with low \n\nphase velocity for all frequency components is known as the fundamental mode curve, while the \n\nrest all are termed as higher modes. Higher mode exists above a certain frequency. The two most \n\ncommonly active source surface wave dispersion curve method used will be discussed here; both \n\nmethods have the advantage that they can be easily employable in the urbanized environment.   \n\n4.2 SASW (Spectral Analysis of Surface Waves) \n\nSASW was introduced in 1980 ((Heisey et al., 1982)) for the surface wave spectral analysis and \n\nRayleigh wave dispersion retrieval. For the generation of seismic wave, an impulsive source is \n\nused, and the propagated waves are recorded with two, or in some cases, 12 geophones. To \n\nobtain the dispersion curve on the wide frequency range, impulsive sources of different impacts \n\n(hammer, weight drop) are used at various distances from the first geophone (sensor), with the \n\npurpose to excite waves of different frequency contents. \n\nData recorded by geophones are processed in the frequency domain for Rayleigh wave velocity \n\nretrieval. The schematic diagram describing the overall procedure of the SASW method is shown \n\nin Fig.4.1. Two sensors time series, i and k, are taken at a time. The source and first receiver \n\ndistance, xi, are kept equal to the distance between two receivers (xk). Both of the sensors time \n\nseries are transformed into frequency domain to calculate the corresponding spectral density, \n\n      , which gives the power of the signal as function of frequency.  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n34 \n \n\n. \n\nFig.4. 1 The schematic describing the overall procedure of the SASW method. \n\nTo estimate the connection between two-time series as a function of frequency, the cross spectral \n\ndensity distribution is found out through Eq.4.1 as \n\n               \n              (4.1) \n\nwhere Mik(f) and  ik(f) are the magnitude spectrum and the phase spectrum of the cross spectral \n\ndensity, respectively, and i =    . The time taken by the Rayleigh waves to travel between the \n\ntwo sensors (geophones) is given by \n\n       \n      \n\n   \n         (4.2) \n\nwhere        is the time taken through distance xk-xi  by the frequency component (f) of the \n\nRayleigh waves. The Rayleigh waves phase velocity and wavelength at frequency (f) can be \n\nfound out through equation 4.3 and 4.4 as \n\n        \n      \n\n      \n          (4.3) \n\n        \n      \n\n \n          (4.4) \n\nThis process is repeated with different impact sources and sensors distances       and also for \n\ndifferent source-receiver distances   . Later, the dispersion curve of the Rayleigh waves is \n\nobtained. Rayleigh wave phase velocity curve upper and lower bounds are found out using \n\nstandard deviation for each frequency component, which is later used for inversion to retrieve \n\nshear wave velocity as a function of depth. \n\nSpectral analysis of surface waves (SASW) are repeated for different receiver of pairs of \n\ndistances in order to manually examine the quality of the result, so it is very time-consuming. \n\nAnother error, which is often made during the SASW analysis, is the misidentification of surface \n\n\n\n \n \n\n35 \n \n\nwave signal from noise (body wave or higher mode). If a noise (body waves) is taken as surface \n\nwave signal, it will compromise the quality of dispersion curve and also, the shear wave velocity \n\n(Park et al., 1999). \n\n4.3 MASW (Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves) \n\nMultichannel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) was introduced by Park et al (1999). Like \n\nmost of the geophysical methods, the MASW method can be divided into three steps: data \n\nacquisition, data processing, and inversion analysis. A brief description of each step will be \n\ngiven here, followed by the advantages of this method over the other surface wave method. The \n\nmains procedures of the MASW are given in the schematic diagram shown in Fig.4.2. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig.4. 2 A overview of the MASW method: (a) Geophones are lined up on the surface of the test site. A wave is \n\ngenerated and the wave propagation is recorded; (b) A dispersion image (c) is obtained from the recorded surface \n\nwave data. The high amplitude bands display the dispersion characteristics and is used to construct the fundamental \n\nmode dispersion curve (d). A theoretical dispersion curve is obtained based on assumed layer thicknesses and \n\nmaterial parameters for each layer and compared to the experimental dispersion curve (e). The shear wave velocity \n\nprofile and the layer structure that result in the best fit are taken as the result of the survey (f) (taken from \n\n\u00d3lafsd\u00f3ttir, 2016). \n\n4.3.1 MASW data acquisition procedure \n\nTo acquire the MASW data, a set of 12, 24, 48 or even 96 geophones are usually used (Donohue, \n\n2013). The geophones are vertically coupled to the ground on a line with equal geophone spacing \n\n\n\n \n \n\n36 \n \n\ndx. All the geophones are connected to a separate channel and the whole system is analysed by a \n\nfield computer, which has a data recording quality control software. Seismic waves are generated \n\nby an impact source at one end of the geophones array. The recorded data consist of time or \n\ntime-offset histories in discrete form. The data (wave field) recorded is expressed as u(x,t), \n\nwhere x is the distance from the source to a geophone and t is the time.  The record u(x,t) is \n\ndigitized at a sampling interval dt, corresponding to sampling frequency   , which is the number \n\nof data points recorded in unit time. The usual sampling interval used for active MASW is 1 ms, \n\nwhich corresponds to a sampling frequency of 1000 Hertz. The sampling frequency in terms of \n\nangular frequency is defined as        . The record length of one second is enough for \n\nMASW impact source (Park 2015). In case of using a vibrating seismic source (vibrator) a longer \n\nrecording time (2 s) is required (Park 1999). \n\nThe maximum depth (    ) to which the MASW survey gives a reliable measure of shear wave \n\ndepends on the characteristics of the site, sensors threshold frequency    and impact source type. \n\nA general rule of thumb for the depth of investigation is related with longest wavelength \n\nrecorded during acquisition (Park &amp; Carnevale, 2010). \n\n                              (4.5) \n\nThe effects of the sensors used during the acquisition are not thoroughly investigated yet. Park \n\nand Miller (2002) pointed out that geophone sensors with threshold frequency     10 and 40 Hz \n\ncan be used to record the surface wave field up to 5 and 10 Hz. Xia (2009) noted that to retrieved \n\nshear wave velocity up to 30-50 m  depth, the geophones with    4.5 Hz are good choices. \n\nAnother important aspect of data acquisition is the choice of the source to generate seismic \n\nwaves. The most commonly used impact source for seismic wave generation is sledgehammer of \n\n5 to 10 kg (Park, 2007). Another important seismic generating source for MASW is weight drop \n\nin which a heavy weight is drop from a crane. The source which can produce high impact on \n\nground is capable of producing surface wave of low frequency (long-wavelength) and hence \n\nfacilitate a deeper investigation. The use of a base plate (metallic or firm rubber) for hammer \n\nimpact point helps in generating low frequency surface waves (Park, 2015). To overview the \n\nMASW setup parameter for the data acquisition a literature review was done. Here, the main \n\npracticing parameters of data recording such as profile length, receiver spacing and source offset \n\nwere listed.   \n\n4.3.2 Length of the geophones spread \n\nThe spread of geophones (L) for data acquisition is connected with the maximum wavelength \n\n(    ) recorded during acquisition, which corresponds to the maximum investigation depth \n\n(    ). The general rule of thumb is the maximum wavelength is equal to the spread array (Park \n\nand Carnevale, 2010) \n\n                (4.6) \n\n\n\n \n \n\n37 \n \n\nThe study of Park &amp; Carnevale (2010) has shown that an error of 5% might occur if trying to \n\nanalyse higher wavelength than the receiver spread          . For practice, Park (2015) \n\nsuggested that the spread of the geophones should lies with               , and Xia \n\n(2009) recommend a spread of        . The seismic waves generated for the data acquisition \n\nin MASW by impact survey sources will attenuate below the detectable signal level until to the \n\nend of the large spread  geophones, that's the reason why very long receiver spreads are avoided \n\nduring the acquisition \n\n4.3.3 Receiver spacing and source offset \n\nThe space between two receivers (dx) is associated with minimum wavelength (      which can \n\nbe included in the Rayleigh wave phase velocity curve (dispersion curve). Xia (2009) pointed out \n\nthat to avoid spatial aliasing the minimum wavelength should not be larger than    \n \n\n \n \n\n   \n. \n\nAnother important aspect about the receiver spacing is regarding to the thickness of the topmost \n\nlayer. Receiver spacing acts as a control parameter for the minimum thickness of layer which can \n\nbe retrieved during the inversion:           , where     is the thickness of top soil layer \n\n(Park et al., 1999; Xia et al., 2009). \n\nThere are two important features which are directly associated with source offset, near-field \n\neffect and far-field effect. The near field-effect situation occurs when the offset of the source (x) \n\nis not large enough to produce planar surface waves. To avoid the near-field effect, the source \n\noffset (x) should be in accordance with the maximum wavelength expected to be recorded in the \n\nacquisition. Generally, planar surface wave arrival occurs at the nearest receiver when the source \n\noffset is greater than half of the maximum wavelength      (i.e,        where x is the source \n\noffset). Far-field effect is the situation when attenuation of high-frequency components of waves \n\ntravelling along the free surface causes body waves to dominate the wave field (Park and \n\nShawver, 2009). The minimum (xmin) and maximum (xmax) source offsets for use in practice have \n\nbeen suggested (Park,2015) \n\n                              (4.7) \n\n \n\nThe measurement profile setup parameters discussed in preceding sections are summarized in \n\nTable 4.1. The length of the receiver spread (L) and the length of the source offset (x) are given \n\nwithin a range, as indicated Table 4.1. The receiver spacing (dx) is calculated by assuming that \n\nN=24 receivers are used for data acquisition. The possible effects of surface wave attenuation, \n\ni.e., due to the length of the receiver spread or the length of the source offset, are not specifically \n\nconsidered in the Table 4.1. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n38 \n \n\nDepth Maximum \n\nwavelength \n\nReceivers spread Source offset Receiver interval \n\nzmax [m]   max (m) L (m) x1 (m) dx (m) \n\n5  10 5-15 1-15 0.4 \n\n10 20 10 -30 2-30 0.9 \n\n20 40 20-60 4-60 1.7 \n\n30 60 30-90 6-90 2.6 \n Table.4. 1 Summary of the acquisition parameter (more detailed parameter setup for 24 and 48 geophones for \nvarious depth can be found on www.masw.com). \n\n4.3.4 The effect of topography on MASW acquisition \n\n \n\nThe natural layout of the Earth\u2019s surface is termed as topography. Topography has an effect on \n\nthe quality of the acquired surface wave data and therefore, on the quality of retrieved dispersion \n\ncurve. The terrain on which the acquisition are made should be flat for the optimum results; \n\nwithin the receiver spread, the surface relief should be less than 0.1L (Park, 2015, Fig.4.3a,b). \n\nZeng et al. (2012) pointed out that the slope of the surface along the receivers spread should be \n\nless than 10\n0\n. A steeper slope (   0\u00ba; Fig.4.3d) leads to a significant error, compromising the \n\nquality of retrieved dispersion curve.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig.4. 3 Shows a sketch of receiver profile for acquisition (taken from www.masw.com) \n\n  \n\n4.4 Dispersion analysis of the acquired data \n\n \n\nOne of the most crucial steps of the MASW analysis is the retrieval of correct dispersion curve \n\n(Park et al., 1998). There are several methods employed for this task (McMechan &amp; Yedlin, \n\n1981; Park et al., 1998, 1999). Here in this section, we discuss the two most commonly used \n\ntechniques for the dispersion curve retrieval (swept-frequency and phase shift method; Park et \n\nal., 1998, 1999). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n39 \n \n\n4.4.1 Swept-frequency technique \n\nSwept-frequency technique was first described by Park et al. (1999). It is used to extract the \n\nfundamental mode dispersion curve from the MASW recorded. The procedure of the method is \n\nto determine, trace to trace, the time arrival and amplitude coherence of the surface waves \n\nrecorded.  \n\nIn such procedure, the Rayleigh waves phase velocity of different frequencies is obtained by the \n\nslope of each frequency (Park et al, 1999). A little processing effort is required in swept \n\nfrequency record to retrieve a dispersion curve from an active source recording (shot gather). \n\nThe coherence of surface wave motion is used as a tool to neglect the noise source in the data, \n\nsuch as body waves and higher Rayleigh in arrival mode, causing a break in the coherence. \n\nThe procedure of swept frequency can be outlined in two-step, like as getting swept frequency \n\nrecord and determining the phase velocity curve from coherency of each frequency component \n\nof the record. \n\n \n\nFig.4. 4 Show the sketch of swept frequency procedure (modified from \u00d3lafsd\u00f3ttir ,2016). \n\n \n\nThe sketch of Fig.4.4 can be explained in the follow steps: \n\n1. For n receivers, the indirect recording (impulsive source) and for direct source recording (a \n\nvibrating seismic source) a swept frequency record is obtained by transforming  by convolution \n\nthe swept-frequency with a stretch function .The indirect impulsive record are transformed to \n\nswept-frequency by the convolution of a stretch function s(t) with the record        as  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n40 \n \n\n                             (4.8) \n\nThis process in Eq.4.8 is performed from trace to trace for total record of n traces such as  \n\n                                (4.9) \n\nwhere           is swept-frequency for j-th trace;         is the impulsive record for j-th trace; \n\n     stretch function (Eq.4.10 and Fig.4.5) is a function (sinusoidal) of changing frequency \n\n(        ) with time (T). Here            are the lowest and highest frequencies to be processed \n\nwhile T is the total length of the     . \n\n               \n         \n\n \n\n \n       (4.10) \n\n \n\nFig.4. 5 Shows the swept frequency record for a trace of impulsive source  (from a short gather)  by convolution \n\nwith stretch function s(t) of changing frequency  (f_1=5 Hz? ,f?_2=30 Hz) (\u00d3lafsd\u00f3ttir ,2016). \n\n \n\n2. In the next step, after swept frequency record is obtained, the determination of trace to trace \n\ntime arrival and amplitude coherency of the recorded surface waves are analysed on the swept-\n\nfrequency recorded (Fig.4.6). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n41 \n \n\n \n\nFig.4. 6 Swept-frequency record obtained from an impulsive shot gather. Red markers identify the local maxima of \n\neach trace that are parts of linear events that are considered reliable for further analysis. Local maxima that are not \n\nused for analysis are shown with blue markers (taken from \u00d3lafsd\u00f3ttir, 2016). \n\n \n\n3. Each linear event corresponds to a specific frequency. The frequency corresponding to each \n\nlinear event is determined. The frequency corresponding to linear event l (fl) is assumed to be the \n\naverage frequency within the event. \n\n4. The linear slope of each linear event is determined by using the method of least squares. \n\n5. The Rayleigh wave velocity at the frequency representative of each linear event is determined. \n\nThe Rayleigh wave velocity is taken dividing the slope of the least squares regression line. The \n\nprocess is repeated for the whole record and dispersion curve, and a function of frequency is \n\nobtained at the end. \n\n \n\nFig.4. 7 Linear events extracted from a swept-frequency record. Red markers identify the local maxima of each trace \n\nthat are used for identification of linear events. Two linear events corresponding to frequencies (f) of 11.3 Hz and \n\n18.8 Hz are indicated by black Lines (\u00d3lafsd\u00f3ttir, 2016). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n42 \n \n\n \n\n4.4.2 Phase-shift method \n\n \n\nThis procedure is actually a wave field transformation method termed as phase-shift technique. \n\nFor a shot gather of an impulsive source record of MASW, the dispersion curve is obtained by \n\ndispersion image (phase-velocity spectra) (Park et al., 1998). Utilizing the phase shift technique, \n\ndifferent mode of Rayleigh waves dispersion can be perceived from the frequency content and \n\nphase velocity at each frequency. The body wave and other scatter energy (reflected-refracted), \n\nwhich are considered as a noise, can be easily recognized by its frequency content and move-out. \n\nThe dispersion curve of Rayleigh waves is extracted from the dispersion image (Park et al., \n\n1998; Xia et al., 2003). The phase shift retrieval of dispersion curve processing is a tri-stage \n\nprocedure, which is comprised of: Fourier transformation of the data, dispersion imaging, and \n\nretrieval of dispersion curve. A sketch like of the swept frequency method for the processing \n\nsteps is shown in Fig.4.8. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig.4. 8 A sketch of phase-shift (\u00d3lafsd\u00f3ttir ,2016) \n\nThe phase shift method outlined in Fig 4.8 can be detailed in steps as follows. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n43 \n \n\n1. The acquired data is in time-space       . It is transformed into Fourier domain along the \n\ntime axis       . As the acquired data is discrete both in time and in space, the Fourier \n\ntransform is achieved for each trace, separately, along the time axis as discrete Fourier \n\ntransformation (DFT). \n\n                     \n \n\n  \n       (4.11) \n\n       is represented as function of amplitude and phase                 as follow \n\n                            (4.12) \n\nwhere \n\n                         (4.13) \n\nThe dispersion related properties are sealed in the phase spectrum       , while the amplitude \n\nspectrum carries the information regarding the attenuation and spherical divergence (Park et al., \n\n1999). The term      is defined as  \n\n     \n \n\n     \n         (4.14) \n\nand the term       is determined at each frequency as  \n\n      \n             \n\n     \n                     (4.15) \n\nwhere    is the distance from the source to the first receiver and dx is the spacing between \n\ngeophones.  \n\n2. As dispersion related properties are embedded in phase spectrum, amplitude spectrum in the \n\nfrequency domain is normalized by dividing its absolute value without losing any information. \n\n           \n     \n\n       \n         (4.14) \n\nwhere            is the normalized amplitude of the jth trace . \n\n3. A phase velocity range is selected for analysis, such as,                      (for \n\nexample, 10m/s to 2000 m/s). \n\n4. For a given frequency and phase velocity, the time delay to balance the specific offset is found \n\nout in term of phase-shift. \n\n5. The phase-shift calculated is applied to all separate traces of shot gather and later added to \n\nobtain the summed amplitude against each set of           . Both of these steps (4 and 5) are \n\nrepeated for different frequencies with a small incremental increase in test phase velocity \n\n(VR,T). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n44 \n \n\n6. The Rayleigh wave phase velocity dispersion curve is obtained from the plot of summed \n\namplitude of the slant-trace in frequency-phase velocity domain. The peak amplitude of the \n\nsummed slant-trace displays the dispersion properties in term of color coding with normalized \n\namplitude. \n\n \n\nFig.4. 9 Shows the basic principle behind the phase-shift method: (a) Normalized sinusoid curves with the frequency \n\nof 20 Hz and phase velocity of 140 m/s; (b) Normalized summed amplitude as a function of frequency for a different \n\nnumber of traces (www.masw.com) \n\n \n\nFig.4. 10 Show the frequency-phase velocity plot as function summed amplitude (dispersion image for BEB4a, \n\nBebedouro area). \n\n4.6 Advantage of MASW method \n\n \n\nThe MASW method overcame the limitations of the SASW method initially introduced. SASW \n\nmethod data acquisition requires more effort when compared to MASW data acquisition, for \n\n\n\n \n \n\n45 \n \n\nexample, to cover a wide frequency range for dispersion analysis, SASW acquisition is repeated \n\nwith different impact points and with diverse source-receivers intervals along with different \n\nsensors intervals. A single MASW measurement is sufficient for all this analysis which is done \n\nby multiple recording with different sources, variable source receiver intervals and different \n\nreceivers spacing for SASW (Park et al, 1999). As the final goal of almost all surface wave based \n\nmethods is to obtain the dispersion curve, the method which achieves it with less physical and \n\ncomputational effort will be considered better than the others. The dispersion curve retrieval in \n\nMASW cases is faster and can be effortlessly automated. The noise reduction (body or \n\nreflected/scattered waves) can be handled easily in MASW, when compared to SASW (Park et \n\nal., 1999). The investigation's depth of each technique is another way to eligible a better job over  \n\nthe other. For a given impact load, the investigation depth provided by MASW (generally 30-50 \n\nm) is greater than (Park et al., 2007) the achieved by SASW (20 m) (Bessason &amp; Erlingsson, \n\n2011). MASW method is handier in identifying the multimodal dispersion than the SASW (Xia \n\n&amp; Miller, 2003). The last advantage to mention which interest in this study is also the possibility \n\nof measuring the dispersion curve analysis of passive surface wave generated by environmental \n\nand cultural noise. The lower frequency characteristics of passive surface wave helps to obtain \n\ndispersion curve for higher wavelengths which in turn it provides deeper investigation. \n\n \n\n4.7  Inversion of dispersion curve \n\n \n\nAfter obtaining the Rayleigh wave dispersion curve, the next step is to obtain the shear wave \n\nvelocity profile by the inversion analysis of the retrieved experimental curve. The inversion \n\nprocess is based on Rayleigh waves propagation in a layered Earth model. The inversion process \n\nof surface wave is a non-linear operation. Several mathematical frameworks are used to estimate \n\nthe fundamental and higher mode dispersion curve for the Rayleigh wave from an initial set of \n\nparameters. The initial set of these parameters is either assumed in priority or chosen randomly \n\nfrom the parameter space. These initial parameters are altered during the inversion process and \n\nfor each change, the corresponding theoretical dispersion curve of the model is compared with \n\nthe experimental curve. The inversion of surface wave is a multi-parameter optimization process. \n\nThe general outline of an inversion process is usually divided into three steps: a computational \n\nalgorithm computing the initial set of parameters; a mathematical procedure to estimate the \n\ntheoretical dispersion curve for a computed set of parameters with assumption of layered Earth \n\nmodel; and a computation procedure to minimize the misfit, which is the deviation between \n\ntheoretically estimated and experimental dispersion curves. The inversion algorithm and the \n\nprocedure adopted for inversion of this work will be discussed in Chapter 5, the mathematical \n\nprocedure will be given in chapter 6, as well as, the misfit function of the deviation between \n\ntargets curves and the modelled curve. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n46 \n \n\n4.8 MASW data acquisition for the study \n\n \n\nThree locations were chosen for the experimental analysis for the application of the learned \n\nlessons from the theoretical analysis of the study (give in detail in Chapter 10). The first one are \n\nthe borehole test sites in front of the Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric \n\nSciences, IAG, and Institute of Geosciences, IGC, both at the campus of University of S\u00e3o Paulo. \n\nThe second is the Col\u00f4nia site. Col\u00f4nia, near to S\u00e3o Paulo city, is a circular structure, nearly \n\nswampy, is believed to be a crater site from the impact of a meteorite.

The USP site \n\n(in front of the IAG - Instituto de Astronomia, Geof\u00edsica e Ci\u00eancias Atmosf\u00e9ricas, cited here \n\nfrequently as IAG-front) has the advantage of the borehole data availability for the calibration \n\nand the quality check of the result, the Col\u00f4nia site was chosen due to its geological significance, \n\nits bowl shape structure is almost swampy and most of the conventional geophysical methods are \n\ndifficult to employ there because of the surface water and mud (there are some small patches of \n\ndry land which make it possible to install a seismometer for noise recording and hence, the H/V \n\nanalysis) , the Bebedouro area was chosen because of the availability of seismic noise data \n\nrecording, as well as, the data about the multiple water wells subsurface interfaces, from which \n\nthe information about the subsurface interfaces are accessible and it was easy to test thickness \n\nfrequency relation over this site. Among all these three sites, the two IAG-IGC and Col\u00f4nia has a \n\nstrong bedrock laying below the unconsolidated soft sediments, being also true for the \n\nBebedouro area, however, this area surface sediments are stronger when compared to the pre-\n\nmentioned sites. The detailed geological description of these sites are beyond the scope, \n\nhowever, a concise introduction will be presented for each of the sites prior to its inversion in the \n\ncoming chapters. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n48 \n \n\nChapter 5: General inversion strategies for the surface waves analysis \n\n \n\n5.1 The forward and inversion problem \n\n \n\nUnderstanding the data is one of the basic starting steps in all the inverse problem cases. Data is \n\nsimply the list of some numerical values, which is most conveniently represented as a vector. If \n\nN is the number (measurement) which an experiment is repeated, each result is an addition to \n\ndata as element of data vector. After N performances, the data will have N elements. Noteworthy \n\nis that observations from an experiment (data) are not knowledge, the knowledge is gained from \n\nthe analysis of data in general and inverse theory in particular. The knowledge can be obtained in \n\nmany forms. Our knowledge will take the form of numerical value (s-wave velocity model). \n\nThe link between data and model can be defined in one line such that: data = what we have \n\nmeasured; model parameters = numbers that constitute knowledge; something distilled from the \n\ntheory data or physical law is the link between the two, data and model parameter. To understand \n\nit, let's consider an example: if we want to find the density of rock from its mass and volume, the \n\nmass and volume measured are the data, having two elements {d1= mass and d2=volume} , with \n\nN=2 (d1,d2) and the unknown model parameter is one as M=1 (density as m1). In this study, The \n\nphysical law which link data and model would be the statement that the density multiplied by \n\nvolume is equal to the mass and can be written in compact form by the vector equation as \n\nd2m1=d1 (Menke 1989). There are two types of problem, one is known as forward problem \n\n(Fig.5.1), while the other is known as inverse problem, which are defined below. \n\n \n\nFig.5.11 Shows the illustration of inversion and forward problems (from Scales &amp; Snieder, 2000). \n\nForward problem is known as numerical models obtained on the basis of computation of \n\ntheoretical values corresponding to experimental data measurement, d.  \n\nThe inverse problem is where the information concerning of the physical properties of the model \n\nand the values to be assigned to the parameters have to be inferred from the data (Fig.5.1). \n\n                  (5.1) \n\n\n\n \n \n\n49 \n \n\nIn Eq.5.1, where     , or Gm in matrix notation, is a function that maps the model    on the \n\ndatum    (Snieder, 1998),         and     are in matrix form d = [d1, d2, \u2026 dN]\nT\nm = [m1, m2, \n\n\u2026 mM]\nT\nand G=[N M]. G is termed as  data kernel matrix, d is known and it is the column vector \n\nof the N data points. It is possible to solve this matrix equation to find the M model parameters \n\nof the vector m. In a another way, looking at Eq.5.1, if m is known and utilize data kernel matrix \n\nto estimates d, it is a forward problem and if d is known, and use inverse of data kernel matrix to \n\nfind the model parameters m, is considered inverse problem. The linearity degree of       , is \n\none of the most important aspect of an inverse problem. The geophysical observation d = [d1, d2, \n\n\u2026 dN]\nT\nm and model parameters [m1, m2, \u2026 mM]\n\nT\n relationship will be either linear (e.g., f(x) = a \n\n+ bx) or nonlinear             . As function of linearity, it will be more or less complex \n\nwithin the optimization procedure.  \n\nTo summarize the inversion problem in geophysical perspective in one sentence might be said \n\nthat \u201cTo make suggestions about the Earth model parameters from geophysical observations\u201d. In \n\nthe case of dispersion and ellipticity curves, the forward problem can be estimate the (dispersion \n\nand ellipticity) curves, while on the contrary, inversion problem estimates the medium properties \n\n(S-wave profile) from the experimentally obtained dispersion and ellipticity curves. \n\n5.2 Global and local minimal solution of an inverse problem \n\nOne of the easiest and simplest approaches is to solve an inverse problem by data fitting, which \n\ninvolves minimizing the misfit       (also termed as the objective function, or squared error) \n\namong the set of estimated  Gi( )  and observed data (di). This approach is a function of joint \n\nestimated model m through un-weighted least-squares misfit. \n\n                  \n \n\n         (5.2) \n\nIn case of linear forward problem the squared error       are estimated via Eq.5.2 to fit the data. \n\nThe       dependence on the parameter has a parabolic shape containing a single minimum \n\n(unimodal). Any method employed to find out this minimum will be able to find it, which will \n\ncorrespond to the best model and will explain the data more closely than all other models (Press \n\net al., 1992). However, most of the inversion problems in seismology are nonlinear. In such case \n\n      dependency on the parameter contain many peaks and it is termed as multimodal (Fig 5.2 \n\nb). Between these minima\u2019s there is one absolute minimum peak known as global minimum, \n\nwhich is linked to the best model to explain the data. The other minima's, apart from the global \n\none, are known as local minima\u2019s and somehow, are linked to the best models. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n50 \n \n\n \n\nFig.5.12 Shows the least-squares misfit function for a linear problem. (b) The conventional view of the misfit \n\nfunction for a nonlinear inverse problem (Menke, 2012). \n\nThere are two more commonly mistakes made during the inversion process; one is the \n\nconsideration of local minima as a global one. In such situation, the data fit are not able to give \n\nthe best data fit (Snieder, 1998). The second problem usually faced is the solution may not lie \n\nwithin the physical limits, although the data fit might be better. To handle such situation, the \n\nmisfit function is made clearer to include extra conditions (limits) converging to the acceptable \n\nphysical limits. \n\nTo find the minimum of the misfit function of an inverse problem is considered more an art than \n\nscience, apart from all the mathematical development made in this regard (Snieder, 1998). This \n\nart foundation is based on the generalized inverse theory presented by Backus and Gilbert in the \n\nmid-sixties (e.g. Backus and Gilbert, 1967, 1968, 1970). They tried to retrieve the ground \n\nstructure by data analysis strategies. This initial work opens up a new corridor which has been \n\nheavily studied since then, and several inversion strategies have been developed. The study of \n\nthe performances of these developed inversion strategies are done by the analysis of exploration \n\nand exploitation criteria (Sambridge &amp; Mosegaard, 2002). Exploration means the reducing of \n\nmisfit function by a randomly trial basis on different region of parameter space, irrespective of \n\nwhat is already known from the previous samples. The exploitation criteria are the other way \n\naround, which where it is choosen the next sample by using the knowledge of previous samples, \n\nor the only best current fit sample. Keeping these two criteria as basis for the analysis, \n\nSambridge &amp; Mosegaard (2002) found out that in case of adopting an explorative strategy for the \n\ninversion like Tabu search, Uniform search, Importance sampling, Genetic Algorithms, \n\nSimulated annealing, Evolutionary programming and  Neighbourhood algorithm are unlikely to \n\ntrap in local minima, however, these are slower at convergence. In the case of using an \n\nexploitative strategy for inversion (e.g., Newton-Raphson, Steepest descent, and Amoeba \n\nsearch), they are very fast in converging to a specific area of parameter space but are more prone \n\n\n\n \n \n\n51 \n \n\nto trap in local minima and inferred ground structure are more likely depended on the initial \n\nmodel considered for inversion. \n\n \n\nFig.5.13 A schematic representation of various search/optimization algorithms in terms of exploration and \n\nexploitation of the information. Shaded borders indicate a deterministic (not\u2013Monte Carlo) method (Sambridge and \n\nMosegaard, 2002). \n\nTo draw a conclusion from the previous discussion, it can be said that an inversion strategy can \n\nbe adopted depending on the basis of the goal of the study (quick convergence or global \n\nsolution). As for our case, we will adopt an inversion strategy for the surface wave (dispersion \n\nand ellipticity). A combination of exploration and exploitation may be more suitable as surface \n\nwave inversion problems are highly non-linear and have many minima's in the misfit function, \n\nwhere each minimum fit the data with the same misfit. \n\n5.2. Surface wave curves inversion strategies \n\nSurface waves, especially Rayleigh waves analysis, are most commonly employed for the job of \n\ninferring the subsurface structure for engineering application. Rayleigh wave curves (dispersion \n\nand ellipticity) are greatly nonlinear function of S-waves velocity (Vs), thickness (h), P-waves \n\nvelocity (Vp) and density (?), respectively. The inversion problem is termed as multimodal \n\nbecause of the existence of a large number of local minima's in the respective parameter space \n\n(Yamanaka and Ishida, 1996). Two main methodologies are applied to handle the non-linearity \n\nof surface wave inversion case. The first one is the nonlinear objective function (e.g. f(x) =\n\n). This function is mathematically linearized by changing an appropriate variable (e.g h(x) \n\n= ln [f(x)] = -ax+b) or first order Taylor expansion, and later, any linear inversion technique is \n\napplied for optimization procedure. In the second procedure no mathematical linearization is \n\n\n\n \n \n\n52 \n \n\nperformed to the solution of the inverse problem. It is find out with some deterministic or \n\nprobabilistic approach. The following section will briefly outline the two strategies. \n\n5.2.1 Iterative method (Linearized inversion) \n\nThe main theme of this class of inversion scheme is the fast convergence of the minimum of the \n\nmisfit function by an iterative method through a gradual changing made on the properties of \n\ncurrent model chosen prior to the inversion. The inversion strategies that fall in this category are \n\ndamped least-square, steepest descendent, conjugate gradients and Newton-Raphson (Press et al., \n\n1992). In the case of adopting all of these mentioned methods, it is possible to observe the \n\nconvergence toward the solution by partial derivatives or Jacobian matrix. Jacobian matrix is a \n\npartial derivative matrix that contains the partial derivative of theoretical data of estimated model \n\nwith respect to the model parameter. The partial derivatives computation allows the linearization \n\nof the non-linear inverse problem. The process is repeated many times (iteration) to converge to \n\nthe minimum of misfit function. Another iterative method employed for the linearized inversion \n\nis the downhill simplex (Press et al. 1992). The downhill simplex requires function evaluations \n\ninstead of derivatives, unlike Damped least-square, steepest descendent, conjugate gradients or \n\nNewton-Raphson. \n\nThis linearization class of inversion is used for the situation when the dimension of the space \n\nparameter is higher. This method converges quickly to the solution of the problem. As described \n\nabove, in situation of high non-linearity of the problem, when there are many minima's in the \n\nmisfit function, all these methods are prone to converge to one of the misfit minima regardless of \n\nthe global minimum. The final obtained model will be highly dependent on the initial model. The \n\nnon-unique solution of the surface wave inversion is very common (Sambridge, 2001). All these \n\nlinearization strategies require a good initial model to start the inversion. The final model may \n\nlead to a starting model after a large number of iteration.  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n53 \n \n\nMaking a conclusion about the linearized inversion strategies, these methods will give the best \n\nresults in the case on the feebly non-linear problem. The methods shown can only be applied to a \n\nhighly non-linear problem in a situation of sufficient previous information about the ground \n\nstructure. However, in a surface wave inversion scenario, where the shear wave velocities are \n\nlinked to surface wave velocities in a complicated way (highly non-linearity and multimodal \n\nmisfit), mostly of the methods failed to find a global solution. The interested reader of the \n\nlinearized inversion strategies is referred to Dorman and Ewing (1962), Herrmann (1994), Lai \n\n(1998) and Xia et al. (1999). Among the various procedures recommended for the inversion \n\nunder linearized strategy, Singular Value Decomposition - SVD (Golub &amp; Reinsch, 1970) is the \n\nmost widely used. SVD is the best choice for producing a solution in the case of ill-condition \n\nmatrices. \n\n5.2.2 Monte Carlo inversion strategies \n\nThe main idea of these methods is originated from the experimental branch of mathematics \n\nwhich used random numbers to find a solution to a deterministic or probabilistic problem. The \n\nsearch of parameters space (predefined parameters upper and lower bounds) was initially \n\nachieved by uniform sampling for an optimal solution of an inverse problem under these \n\ninversion strategies. The parameter space search  is done by the uniform sampling of the \n\nparameter space without taking any initial model to start the process. All these Monte Carlo \n\nmethods, unlike linearized inversion strategies (which necessitate partial derivatives and matrix \n\ninversion which might cause numerical instabilities), require only forward model and misfit \n\ncomputation, that's why Monte Carlo inversion strategies are considered potentially stable \n\ntechniques. The advantages of the Monte Carlo inversion strategies are: i) though the process is \n\nslow it still ensures the convergence to an optimal solution without any possibility to trap in local \n\nminima; (ii) it explores the whole parameter space, therefore, a best-fitted model of the data and \n\nthe trade-off between various parameter can be evaluated (Sambridge &amp; Mosegaard, 2002); (iii) \n\nit statistically treats the result of the inverse problem, which helps in cases of high non-linearity. \n\nThe uniform sampling of the parameter space in case of a high dimensionality of parameter \n\nspace makes it computationally ineffective. Because of this disadvantage of the uniform Monte \n\nCarlo inversion approach, different refined strategies were presented with pseudo-random \n\nsampling of parameter space (Simulated Annealing by Kirkpatrick et al., 1983; Neighborhood \n\nAlgorithm by Sambridge, 1999, Yamanaka &amp; Ishida, 1996). Below, we will briefly discuss \n\nGenetic algorithm and simulated annealing and then will discuss with details the Neighborhood \n\nAlgorithm which is used for the inversion analysis in this thesis (Geopsy tool packages; \n\nhttp://www.geopsy.org/). \n\n5.2.2.1 Simulated Annealing \n\n \n\nThis class of Monte Carlo inversion strategy method exploits a statistical mechanical analogy to \n\nsearch for the global minimum of a misfit function containing a large number of local minima's \n\n(Sambridge &amp; Mosegaard, 2002). The fundamental thought is to simulate the physical \n\n\n\n \n \n\n54 \n \n\nmethodology of chemical annealing in which a liquefied crystalline material is cooled gradually \n\ntowards the point of solidification and, consequently, a stable high ordered (low-energy) design. \n\nIn similarity to this physical-chemical process, in the inversion plan, the objective function is \n\nrelated to the energy of the crystalline material, while suitable numerical standards are settled, \n\nsimulating a \"cooling\" of the framework to be optimized (Sambridge &amp; Mosegaard, 2002). \n\nWhen an appropriate cooling rate is used, the process is able to find, at least, the location of the \n\nparameter space near the global minimum, as well as, slow cooling results in low-energy crystal \n\nconfigurations. \n\n5.2.2.2 Genetic Algorithm \n\n \n\nThe evolution of biological life is considered as a core theme for this kind of inversion strategy. \n\nThe evolution is considered as an optimization process. A natural system like fauna adapts to its \n\nsurrounding environment to survive. The genetic algorithm at first was developed by Holland \n\n(1975), which was later popularized by Wilson &amp; Vasudevan, (1991), Gallagher et al. (1994), \n\nStoffa &amp; Sen (1991) and Sen &amp; Stoffa (1992) for the different geophysical problems. There are \n\nmany variants of genetic algorithm, however, the basic strategy is to compel a total population of \n\nmodels towards better data to fit at the same time. The genetic algorithm works on the sets of the \n\nparameters with stress placed on the particular parameter, however, the simulated annealing \n\nalgorithm emphasises on a set of parameter which is continually updated. The iteration of the \n\nbasic method involves three stages usually called selection, crossover and mutation. Each step of \n\niteration in the genetic algorithm is controlled by a tuning parameter chosen by the user. In each \n\niteration, all these three steps aim to generate a new offspring model population which, in a way, \n\nhave survived (the models with lower misfit) among the previous models population. At each \n\niteration, the misfit function is evaluated for all models previously generated. The criteria are set \n\nto select only those models which fulfil certain criteria (Survival of the fittest). This converge a \n\nnew model generation toward a lower misfit region of the parameter space. The mechanisms \n\nused to implement selection, crossover, and mutation of the model population can be crucially \n\nimportant to the effectiveness of the algorithm. For a detail discussion the interested readers are \n\nreferred to (Goldberg, 1989; Wilson &amp; Vasudevan, 1991). \n\n5.2.2.3 Neighborhood algorithm \n\n \n\nAs discussed above, both of the Monte Carlo approaches which utilize uniform pseudorandom \n\nsampling of the parameter space become impractical in the case of the high dimensionality of the \n\nproblem due to its heavy computation. The solution to minimized this heavy computation was \n\noffered by Sambridge (1999) when seeking an answer to the question that \"By what means can a \n\nsearch for new models be best guided by all the past models for which the forward problem has \n\nbeen solved (and hence the data misfit value are evaluated)?\u201d. Both genetic and simulated \n\nannealing methods utilize the information from the previous sample generated but in a complex \n\nway. The information deduced from previous samples may also be highly dependent on control \n\n\n\n \n \n\n55 \n \n\nparameters (GA) or temperature profiles (SA), each of which must be tuned for each problem \n\nindividually (Sambridge, 1999). On the other hand, neighborhood algorithm operated by four \n\nparameters is a self-adaptive search of parameter space. The parameter space of the inverse \n\nstrategy is decomposed into cells based on the approximation of the misfit. These cells are \n\nknown as Voronoi cell (Voronoi, 1908; Fig.5.4). The Voronoi cell for any distribution of points \n\nin any number of dimensions of parameter space is the region about a point, which is nearer to \n\npoint under consideration than all other points of the distribution. The region of Voronoi cell \n\naround a point is defined by an appropriate norm distance (typically Euclidean). For Euclidean \n\ndistance in 2D, they are polygons whose edges are perpendicular bisectors between pairs of \n\npoints. In 3D they are convex polyhedra, in higher dimensions they are convex polytopes \n\n(Sambridge, 1998). This division of parameter space into Voronoi cells of neighborhoods region \n\naround a generated points (models) has a powerful property, which is,  how irregular the initial \n\npoints (models) distribution are  and how high the dimensions of the parameter space is. It \n\nalways converges to the part of the parameter space having the optimal solution. \n\n \n\nFig.5.14 Shows the example of Voronoi cells drawn around the points (model) of parameter space for a simple 2-D \n\nproblem. (a\u2013c) Voronoi cells of about 10, 100, and 1000 generated model, respectively. Figure 5.4d shows the true \n\nfitness surface. As the algorithm proceeds, each Voronoi diagram is used to guide the sampling. Note how the \n\nVoronoi cells are more concentrated in the darker regions where the fit is high. (Sambridge &amp; Mosegaard, 2002). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n56 \n \n\n \n\nThe neighborhood algorithm has two important aspects which guides the new generation of \n\nsamples within the parameter space to the promising region of a lower misfit. The first one is the \n\nshape and size of the Voronoi cell, which it is not handled externally but operated and guided \n\nautomatically by the previous sampling. Note that the boundaries of each Voronoi cell are \n\ndetermined by all previous samples, and regardless of how irregularly distributed the samples \n\nare, the Voronoi cell will be a \u2018reasonable\u2019 one, in the sense of an L-norm (Sambridge, 1999).  \n\nAt each iteration step, the newly generated samples are concentrated in the neighborhoods \n\nsurrounding the better data-fitting models. In this way, the algorithm exploits the information \n\ncontained in the previous models to adapt the sampling. The second is the arrangement of the \n\nmodels generated to fit the data on the basis of misfit rank, which helps in identifying good \n\nmodels based on the data fit. All the generated models are rank on the basis of theirs misfit, \n\nwhich help in search the most promising area of the parameter space. \n\n5.3 Brief inversion procedure of neighbourhood algorithm \n\n \n\nThe Neighborhood Algorithm - NA (Sambridge, 1999) is a standout amongst the latest MC \n\ndirect search method for nonlinear inversion. The key idea of the NA is to make use of a simple \n\ngeometrical concept to search the parameter space. In fact, new samples of parameter values are \n\ngenerated by randomly re-sampling within specific Voronoi cells with a locally uniform density. \n\nThe power of this approach consists of the fact that at each iteration, the sampling is influenced \n\nby the size and distribution of the Voronoi cells, which are automatically controlled by all the \n\nprevious samples (Sambridge, 2001). Thanks to the interesting properties of the Voronoi \n\ngeometry, it seems that NA is able to sample the most promising regions of the solution space \n\nsimultaneously (Whatelet, 2005). Therefore, at each iteration, the new samples tend to be \n\nconcentrated in the neighborhood surrounding of the models better fitting the data. \n\nThe Voronoi decomposition of the parameter space is the base of an approximation of the misfit \n\nfunction which is progressively refined during the inversion process. The approximation is set as \n\nconstant inside each cell and the misfit value calculated at the central point is affected to the \n\nwhole cell. A two-dimensional parameter space is given as an example in Fig. 5.5. The black \n\ndots are some model points for which a misfit is calculated. \n\nThe neighbourhood algorithm needs four tuning parameters: \n\nis the number of iteration to perform; \n\nis the number of models chosen at random inside the parameter space at the beginning of the \n\ninversion; \n\nis the number of models generated at each iteration; \n\n\n\n \n \n\n57 \n \n\nis the number of best cells (with the lowest misfit) where the ns models are generated. \n\nThe inversion process is composed of the following phases (described by Sambridge (1999a) and \n\nWathelet, 2005, 2008): \n\n1. A set of  models is randomly generated with a uniform probability in the parameter space; \n\n2. The misfit function is calculated for the most recently generated model; \n\n3. The nr models, with the lowest misfit of all models generated so far, are selected; \n\n4. Generate an average of    new samples with a uniform probability in each selected cell;  \n\n5. Add to the new samples to the previous ensemble of models and go back to 2. \n\nFig.5.15 Shows Voronoi cells for a two-dimensional parameter space (from Sambridge, 1999a). (a) is an example of \n\na two-dimensional parameter showing the models (black dots) and the limits of the Voronoi cells. (b) depicts the \n\nVoronoi geometry after the first iteration (from Wathelet, 2005) \n\nIn Fig 5.5 (a)     =9 (in this case) models are generated and the grey cell has the lowest misfit. \n\nIn this example, seven new models are generated in one cell (   = 1, and    = 7). The size of the \n\noriginal cell decreases as the sampling rate increases. If the cell with the grey outline has the \n\nlowest misfit, the density of sampling will not decrease systematically after each iteration. This is \n\nan interesting property of the Voronoi geometry that allows the centre of sampling to jump from \n\nplace to place, whilst always sampling the most promising nr regions simultaneously. \n\n \n\nIn the neighborhood algorithm, a random walk (Gibbs sampler) is performed with a uniform \n\nprobability density function inside the cell and zero outside. A walk is a sequence of \n\nperturbations of a model along with all the axis. The modified model is statistically independent \n\nof the original model. Asymptotically, the samples produced by this walk will be uniformly \n\n\n\n \n \n\n58 \n \n\ndistributed inside the cell regardless of its shape. To continue the random walk inside a particular \n\ncell, it is mandatory to calculate the multi-dimensional limits of the cell. Calculating the \n\ncomplete Voronoi geometry for high dimensional spaces becomes practically impossible when \n\nthe number of models increases. Sambridge (1999) proposed an original algorithm to compute \n\nonly the limits along lines, which are parallel to the axis, in a precise and efficient way. These \n\nlines support the successive segments of the random walks. \n\nThe exploration and exploitation are nicely handled by the neighborhood algorithm. The \n\nalgorithm is more exploratory if the    new samples are distributed on many cells and it \n\noptimizes more quickly if they are restricted to the very few best cells. Typical values for the \n\ntuning parameters are 100 for    ,   ,   . To force a better optimization, nr may be set to 5, 10 \n\nor 50 (Whatelet, 2005). Tests had generally shown that better misfits are obtained with fewer \n\niterations if nr is low, but the inversion is more trapped in local minima. The exploratory mode \n\n(e.g.   =100 and   =100) usually provides better final misfits if the inversion is conducted with \n\na great number of iterations. The number of iterations ranges from 50 to 200. This makes a total \n\nof 5,000 to 20,000 generated models. Compared to linearized methods, the number of forward \n\ncomputations is greater. Consequently, the forward computation has to be correct for each \n\nparameter set without a visual check, and it must be highly optimized to reduce the total \n\ncomputation time. \n\nThe neighborhood algorithm is used in different studies at different scale. Sambridge  (1999) and \n\nSnoke (2002) employed it for the receiver function inversion at crustal scale, Whatelet (2005) \n\nrefined it further and utilized it for the surface waves inversion at engineering scale. Recently the \n\nNA algorithm was used by Hobiger et al (2013) and Lontsi et al (2015) for ellipticity inversion \n\nwith supplementary information. The interested reader is referred to the paper review  for a very \n\ndetailed procedure about neighborhood algorithm. (Sambridge, 1999a and 1999b also Wathelet, \n\n2008) \n\n5.4. The parameter setting for the inversion \n\nFor an Earth model made of homogeneous horizontal layers, four parameters (shear wave \n\nvelocity Vs, thickness h, P-wave velocity Vp and density  ) can fully describe the computation \n\nof both dispersion and ellipticity curves. The parameter listed above, which affect the shape of \n\nboth dispersion and ellipticity curves, are given in decreasing order. Specially, the P-wave \n\nvelocity and density have very little effect on dispersion curve (Xia et al 2002) and we will try to \n\ncheck its effect on ellipticity in next chapters. For linearized inversion, the ground structure is \n\ndivided into layers of fixed thickness, while Vs are allowed to set as free parameter by fixing Vp \n\nor Poisson ratio for the whole structure. However, Wathelet (2008) pointed out that by taking Vp \n\nvalues for fixation from refraction data has its own uncertainties and, fixing Vp values from \n\nrefraction survey will penalized the result at the end. Therefore, it is suggested to keep Vp and \n\nVs as free parameters linked by Poisson ratio, and the density value are fixed to some value. \n\nBoth Vp and Vs can be defined within a range for lower and upper bound, this sets the physical \n\n\n\n \n \n\n59 \n \n\nrange of parameter space. Taking a large number of layers above bedrock will confined to \n\nconcentrate the generated models around a median depth due to central limit theorem (Wathelet, \n\n2008). Therefore, Wathelet suggested setting up the depth range of the bedrock instead of fixing \n\nthe thickness of each layers so, in this way, thickness also become as free parameter. The \n\npresence of low velocity zone in the subsurface complicates the forward model estimation \n\nbecause of in case of stochastic inversion, like neighborhood procedure, the random generation \n\nof model would be impossible to generate a model for the target curve, which contains low \n\nvelocity zone (Wathelet, 2008). This problem is dealt by trial and error, however, if the area for \n\nwhich the inversion is made has a linear velocity increase, then the model are generated without \n\nthe LVZ. In all our three tested sites for the study we have assumed a linear velocity increase \n\ntrend and have not included the presence of any low velocity layer in the inversion. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n60 \n \n\n \n\nChapter 6: Modelling of the H/V curve \n\n \n\n6. Introduction \n\n \n\nAmongst the researchers working with the H/V techniques the most debated question was how to \n\nmodel the H/V curve with respecting the wave field that contributes in its subsistence. The \n\npurpose is to pinpoint the phases of the elastic wave which might be considered as the major \n\ncontributor in its shape. Initially, It was believed that the ratio (H/V) is mainly influenced by the \n\nSH resonance frequency within the surface layers of soil above the bedrock. However,other \n\nresearchers showed (Nogoshi &amp; Igarashi 1971, Fah et al., 2001, Fah et al., 2003, Scherbaum et \n\nal., 2003) that seismic noise is mainly dominated by a surface wave and the shape of the H/V \n\ncurve is actually subjugated by the shape of the Rayleigh waves ellipticity. This interpretation \n\ngot allot of attention because of the peak and trough points alignment between the experimental \n\nH/V curve and theoretical ellipticity. However, in the case of considering the H/V curve as a \n\nproxy for the Rayleigh wave ellipticity, the H/V curve mostly reproduce the peak and trough \n\nfrequency of the ellipticity curve but failed to match the amplitude of the ellipticity curve. To \n\nexplain this mismatch between the amplitude, some of the studies concluded that this deviation \n\nin shape of the H/V curve are due to the presence of body and Love waves on the horizontal \n\ncomponent of noise wave field around the peak frequency    (Arai &amp; Tokimatsu, 2000 and \n\nYamamoto, 2000). To incorporate the effect of body wave an effort was made by S\u00e1nchez-\n\nSesma et al. (2010; 2011) who considered the noise wave field as a diffuse field and attributed \n\nthe H/V curve to all the seismic phases present in the noise wave field. Here, in this chapter, it \n\nwill be outlined the major theoretical developments used to numerically model the H/V curve by \n\ndifferent assumptions of seismic noise wave field and will compare its results with experimental \n\nH/V recorded at same site, whose velocity model were used to numerically model the curve.  \n\n \n\n6.1 Nakamura explanation of the H/V curve \n\n \n\nNakamura (1989) gave an explanation that, actually, this (H/V) simple spectral ratio technique is \n\na very good indicator of shear wave resonance frequency of a site. He explained the H/V curve \n\nfor the vertically SH incident wave case. However, his initial interpretation was faced with many \n\ncontroversies and objections, such as that H/V curve is not dominated by body waves but it \n\ncontains a major contribution from surface waves (Bard, 1999). Nakamura re-evaluated his \n\ntechnique and included the effect of surface waves in the H/V curve modelling (Nakamura, \n\n2000). Here, a brief idea about his explanation is given. The explanation of wave amplification at \n\nthe surface due to wave propagation from a hard rock through soil is achieved by the product of \n\ntransfer function with the Fourier transform of the waves arriving at the bedrock. Therefore, the \n\n\n\n \n \n\n61 \n \n\nmotion produced at the surface by a horizontal motion at bedrock can be replicated by the \n\ntransfer function multiplied to the Fourier transform of the horizontal motion at the bedrock and \n\nthe Fourier transform of the surface wave as bellow. \n\n \n\n                                      (6.1) \n\n      is the horizontal transfer function between bedrock and soil surface (also known as \n\nfrequency response),          is the Fourier transform of horizontal motion at bedrock surface \n\ndue to the body waves,         ) is the  horizontal motion Fourier transform at surface due to \n\nthe surface wave. Similarly, the motion produced by vertical component at bedrock at soil \n\nsurface is given as \n\n                                       (6.2) \n\nthe terms in Eq.6.2 are same as that of Eq.6.1 but for the vertical component of motion. The \n\ntransfer function for the horizontal component of motion for a soil deposit over a bedrock, of \n\nvelocity   , thickness h and damping (?) is given as (Kramer, 1996)  \n\n      \n \n\n        \n   \n\n          (6.3) \n\nwhere   \n         ? . The expression for vertical transfer is the same function as Eq 6.3 \n\n     , where   \n  is replaced by   \n\n  which is        ?.  To obtain natural frequency of the \n\nsoil deposit the term in Eq 6.1 and Eq6.2 (                 cannot be used directly as it has the \n\neffect of sources that generated the waves. It is, therefore, common to take the ratio of \n\n                for source effect removal such as \n\n      \n        \n\n        \n                 \n\n        \n\n        \n       (6.4) \n\nwhere       is the transfer function for horizontal component motion Fourier transform at the \n\nsurface, while the          is the horizontal component Fourier transform at the rock due to \n\nbody waves. The element of the transfer function for vertical motion,      , has the same \n\ndefinition as that of      . Nakamura\u2019s explanation of H/V is based on an assumption that the \n\nhorizontal and vertical motion at the rock level,  (                  ) is equal such that their \n\nratio is 1.

Comparing the result of Eq.6.9 with the H/V curve of recorded noise at the \n\nIAG borehole site, the peak frequency of the QTS match and has only a deviation of 4% from \n\nexperimental H/V. A similar observation leads Nakamura (1989) to conclude that H/V basically \n\ngives the transfer function of a soil deposit. However, the amplitude of both H/V and result of \n\nQTS (Eq.6.9) rarely match. Another discrepancy of H/V curve is the difference in overall shape \n\nfrom QTS (Fig.6.2). That is why some of the authors concluded that the H/V basically serves as \n\na proxy for the Rayleigh waves ellipticity rather than SH-transfer function (Nogoshi &amp; Igarashi \n\n1971, Fah et al., 2001, Fah et al., 2003, Scherbaum et al., 2003). Bard (1999) reviewed, in detail, \n\nthe Nakamura (1989) theory and rejected the possibility of H/V linkage with SH-transfer \n\nfunction of a soil deposit.

Rayleigh waves are formed by the linear pairing of P (primary \n\nwaves) and SV (vertically polarized shear waves) waves (Aki, 2002). This pairing of vertical and \n\nhorizontal components has a phase shift of  \n \n\n \n . The particle motion induced by Rayleigh waves \n\ndepicts an ellipse. This elliptical particle motion under the Rayleigh waves influence will be \n\neither retrograde or prograde depending on the sign of the phase shift. Similarly, Love waves are \n\ncomposed with horizontally polarized shear waves (SH). The horizontal over vertical \n\ndisplacement component at the surface, described by the particle motion under the Rayleigh \n\nwaves influences results in a curve as function of frequency, which is termed as ellipticity (E) of \n\nRayleigh waves. In the situation of homogeneous half-space the particle motion is retrograde at \n\nall frequencies and ellipticity is constant. However, in case of layered media (elastic, isotropic \n\nand vertically heterogeneous) ellipticity exhibits a peak followed by a trough, while the particle \n\nmotion switch from retrograde to prograde and then to retrograde with the frequency, depending \n\non the velocity contrast between the soil and bedrock (Konno &amp; Ohmachi, 1998). Some \n\nresearchers have shown that the H/V curve is actually depicting the Rayleigh waves ellipticity \n\ncurve for a site (Nogoshi &amp; Igarashi 1971, Fah et al., 2001, Fah et al., 2003, Scherbaum et al., \n\n2003). Here, we will briefly outline this modelling prospective of the theoretical ellipticity curve. \n\nWhen the Rayleigh waves travel through a media, it produces displacement of particle in \n\nhorizontal and vertical directions. This displacement can be described in the form as (Aki and \n\nRichard, 2002) \n\n             \n          \n\n                (6.11) \n\n              \n         \n\nwhere r\n1 \n\nand r\n2\n are the complex amplitude, for positive and real r\n\n1 \n, r\n\n2\n the phase shift between \n\nthese components       can be computed. At angular frequency  , the Rayleigh waves velocity \n\nis V\nR \n\n=  /k. The phase shift between r\n1 \n\nand r\n2\n is ?\n\n \n\n \n . When this phase shift is positive the motion \n\nis termed as prograde, while retrograde if the phase shift is negative. The stress components \n\ncorresponding to this situation are given by \n\n \n\n          \n\n          \n   \n  \n\n                  \n           \n\n\n\n \n \n\n65 \n \n\n          \n   \n  \n\n           \n                (6.12) \n\n                  \n   \n  \n\n           \n           \n\n         \n   \n  \n\n      \n          \n\nwhere           are the Lam\u00e9 parameters       \n   \n  \n\n                 which shows the \n\namplitiude of radial shear stress     .

For Rayleigh waves, the equations of motion are reduced to a system of \n\nsimple differential with a derivative of the first order in z. To solve this problem numerically the \n\noriginal vertically heterogeneous Earth is modelled and replaced by a large number of horizontal \n\nlayers (n+1) over a homogenous half-space (Fig.6.3). The properties of each layer are \n\ncharacterized by four parameters h, Vs, Vp, ? as function of depth z (thickness, shear wave \n\nvelocity, primary wave velocity and density). The homogeneous half space is defined by Vs, Vp\n \n\nand ?\n \nonly (shear wave velocity, primary wave velocity and density). \n\n \n\n \n\nFig.6. 3 Shows the schematic one-dimensional model defined by a stack of (n+1) layers. zi are the depths of the top \n\nof each layer (modified from Aki and Richard, 2002). \n\n \n\nFor the propagation of wave, in case of a stack of horizontal layers over the half-space, the \n\nproblem is expressed by the differential Eq. 6.18 as \n\n \n \n\n  \n                    (6.18) \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n67 \n \n\nwhere f is the general motion-stress vector of n components and A is a nxn matrix whose \n\nelements depend on the elastic parameters of the layers. When displacement is defined at a \n\nreference depth z, the vector f(z0) can be obtained through Eq.6.18. If A is independent of depth \n\nz, which is valid inside a layer, then Eq.6.18 provides a freedom of computing the vector f(z) for \n\nany arbitrary depth. \n\n \n\n                                (6.19) \n\n \n\n        is called Thomson-Haskell propagator matrix. It is a 4x4 matrix, function of depth at \ntop and bottom of the layer, and matrix A. The         elements are calculated by the \neigenvalue decomposition of A(z) and expressed in the form as (Aki and Richards, 2002) \n\n \n\n                            (6.20) \n\n \n\nThe advantage of this approach is  that it can be used for a stack of n-layers (levels), where the n-\n\nlevel is related with the reference on (  ) through the product of the matrix          relative the \nwhole intermediate layers for any arbitrary depth    and expressed as  \n\n \n\n                                                    (6.21) \n\n \n\nEq.6.21 allows to determine the vector f(z) at each arbitrary depth, under the following \n\nconditions: the stress component being null at the surface (z = 0); both displacement and stress \n\nare assumed continuous on the correspondence of each surface between the layers and the one \n\nbetween the last layer and the half-space. The propagator matrix G is the functions of the depth \n\nat the top and at the bottom of each layer, and of the matrix A, which depends upon layer \n\nproperties. It allows simulating the wave propagation into each layer of the model solving the \n\nseries of equations (like Eq.6.21). However, the boundary conditions at infinite depth for \n\nRayleigh waves (Eq. 6.15 and 6.16) can\u2019t be solved directly.  At first this problem is transform \n\ninto a radiation condition that no up-going waves are found in the bottom half-space and then \n\nEq.6.21 is used to solved the motion stress vector for Rayleigh waves Eq.6.15. \n\nEllipticity of Rayleigh waves is evaluated as the displacement ratio of horizontal and vertical \n\ncomponent              at surface, which is estimated for a wave propagated from the bedrock \n\nto surface (see for detail, Aki and Richard, 2002). The solution (non-vanishing) for Rayleigh \n\nwaves cases exist only at certain discrete wave numbers for a given frequency, which are termed \n\n\n\n \n \n\n68 \n \n\nas eigenvalue for that specific frequency. The solution of Eq.6.15 for the specific eigenvalue is \n\nan eigenfunction of the problem. The pairs of eigenvalues and eigenfunction,                  \n\nwhere i=1,M ,rk=1,2,3,4 for Rayleigh waved, each set of     \n             defines a mode of \n\npropagation and, in general, there are M normal modes of propagation at any given frequency  .  \n\nThe ellipticity for IAG borehole model for the first 4 modes is shown in Fig 6.4. Note that \n\nellipticity for fundamental mode exists for all the frequencies, while that one of higher mode \n\nexists beyond a certain frequency. So, usually it is suggested that the shape of H/V curve is \n\ndominated by fundamental mode of Rayleigh waves ellipticity up to the first minimum (Hobiger \n\net al., 2013). Beyond the trough frequency, the influence of higher Rayleigh mode dominates the \n\nH/V curve. The peak and trough of the H/V curve mostly coincide with Rayleigh waves \n\nellipticity peak and trough, however, there is a disagreement in amplitude between the H/V curve \n\nand ellipticity curve (see Fig.6.2). This discrepancy in amplitudes of both the curves is associated \n\nto the presence of Love waves on the horizontal component of noise wave field. In modelling \n\nprospective of ellipticity, it is easy to model a tabulated layered Earth case with thickness, \n\ndensity, Vp and Vs information. However, when dealing with experimental data there is always a \n\nchance of presence of other seismic phases (body and Love waves) contributing to the noise \n\nwave field. Therefore, taking experimental H/V spectral ratio as true representative of Rayleigh \n\nwaves ellipticity might cause biased results. Hence, it is necessary to remove or minimize the \n\neffect of Love and body waves before considering a H/V spectral curve as closer representative \n\nof ellipticity curve for subsurface structure retrieval. We will list the available procedures for the \n\nminimization of Love waves effect from experimental curve in a final chapter with some \n\nexperimental data. In next section, we will discuss the modelling of H/V curve considering both \n\nRayleigh and Love waves. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig.6. 4 Show the ellipticity curve for the first four mode of IAG bore model, yellow line show the experimental \n\nH/V recorded at site.. \n\n \n\n0.001 \n\n0.01 \n\n0.1 \n\n1 \n\n10 \n\n100 \n\n0.2 2 20 \n\nE\nll\n\nip\nti\n\nci\nty\n\n A\nm\n\np\nli\n\ntu\nd\n\ne\n  \n\nFrequency (Hz) \n\nFundamental \nmode \nFirst mode \n\n2nd higher mode \n\n3rd higher mode \n\n4th higher mode \n\n\n\n \n \n\n69 \n \n\n6.3 H/V modelling on the basis of surface wave \n\nAs described above, the shape variation of the fundamental mode of Rayleigh wave ellipticity up \n\nto the trough is responsible for experimental variation of H/V shape curve, while the amplitude \n\nof H/V curve deviation from the ellipticity is attributed to the fraction of Love waves presence in \n\nthe noise wave field. So, what is the consequence if we model the H/V curve by considering the \n\nnoise wave field is dominated only by surface wave? The first attempt in this direction was made \n\nby Arai and Tokimatsu (2000). In this procedure, total average spectral power is estimated by the \n\nintegration on the horizontal plane. This integration is estimated analytically (Malischewsky, \n\n2015). Almost the similar approach was adapted, latter, by Lunedei &amp; Albarello (2009) to model \n\nthe H/V curve by total average spectral power. However, we will use the Arai &amp; Tokimatsu \n\n(2000, 2004) procedure for modelling H/V curve as both gives almost the same results. Arai &amp; \n\nTokimatsu (2000, 2004) considered a model of N-parallel layers made-up from semi-infinite \n\nelastic medium, isotropic, solid, homogenous, where each layer is characterized by thickness Hi, \n\nS-wave velocity, Vsi, P-wave Velocity, Vpi, and density, ?i (Fig.6.5). For the numerical \n\nsimulation of surface waves, they used Harikrider (1964) procedure. The authors also utilized \n\nLachet and Bard (1994) procedure,  such as Fourier transform of vertical       and horizontal \n\n       point source having angular frequency ( ) and randomly distributed over the surface. \n\nFrom each of these points, waves are generated and propagated along the medium. As body \n\nwaves attenuate quickly than the surface waves (Tokimatsu &amp; Tamura, 1995), the displacement \n\nat an origin is considered to be produced by surface waves under far field source situation, which \n\nis, each distance between a source and origin (  ) is greater than the one wavelength of both \n\nRayleigh and Love waves.  \n\n \n\nFig.6. 5 Shows the geometry of (a) soil layer and (b) microtremor source models to formulate the theoretical H/V \n\nspectrum of surface waves considering the effects of fundamental and higher modes (from Arai and Tokimatsu, \n\n2004). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n70 \n \n\nConsidering the ith vertical point force, L\nV\n(?), at a frequency ?, the vertical (demonstrated here \n\nby superscript (\nV\n\n)) and horizontal powers (P) (demonstrated by superscript (\nH\n\n)), the mth mode of \n\nRayleigh waves (\nR\n) can be expressed as \n\n     \n              \n\n       \n \n \n        \n\n                     (6. 22) \n\n \n\n     \n              \n\n        \n    \n\n \n \n        \n\n                                                       (6.23) \n\n        \n\nwhere A\nRm \n\nis the medium response factor (Harkrider, 1964), k is the wavenumber,   is the \n\nellipticity curve of the mth mode of Rayleigh waves on the free surface (Haskell, 1953), r is the \n\ndistance between the origin and the point force, H\n0\n\n(2) \n\nand H\n1\n\n(2) \n\nare the Hankel functions of the \n\nsecond kind of zero and first order, and h\nsc \n\nis the scattering damping ratio of soil (h\nsc \n\n> 0). \n\nIn the same manner by considering the ith horizontal point force, L\nH\n(?), at a frequency ?, the \n\nvertical and horizontal powers of the mth mode of Rayleigh waves and mth mode of Love waves \n\n(\nL\n ) may be expressed as \n\n     \n     \n\n \n\n \n         \n\n        \n             \n\n \n                    (6.24) \n\n     \n     \n\n \n\n \n         \n\n        \n             \n\n \n                   (6.25) \n\n     \n     \n\n \n\n \n         \n\n        \n             \n\n \n                   (6.26) \n\nA\nLm \n\nis the medium response for Love waves.

Theoretical and experimental H/V curves (Fig 6.6) are in good agreement with \n\neach other. Indeed, while the ellipticity curves of the fundamental mode of Rayleigh waves, \n\n(H/V)\nRo\n\n(shown in dashed line in  Fig 6.6 are definitively unable to reproduce the H/V amplitude \n\nvalues of the experimental curves from microtremor recordings, (H/V)\nm\n\n, the theoretical surface \n\nwave curves, (H/V)\nS\n, show a good harmony.

A very recent development in the \n\nmodelling of the H/V curve is the combination of all the previous three explanations in terms of \n\nall elastic wave inclusion and considered noise wave field as a diffused field arises from the \n\nmultiple scattering. Sanchez-Sesma et al. (2011) proposed to consider ambient noise wave field \n\nas a diffuse wave field, which contain all the different types of waves (surface and body). The \n\nambient noise wave field is generated by multiple random uncorrelated forces/sources near to or \n\nat the Earth surface. The wave field may contain the scattering effect of various elastic modes. \n\nThe field intensities could be better described by a diffuse like situation. To assume that the \n\nnoise wave field is diffuse, the H/V curve can be estimated for a receiver at Earth surface in \n\nterms of Green tensor imaginary part at the source (source and receiver are assumed to be at \n\nsame location). The work of Sanchez-Sesma provides an idea of linkage between energy density \n\nand imaginary part of GF in 3D (energy densities of the noise wave field is proportional to the \n\nimaginary part of Green tensor). The H/V curve, obtained from the square root ratio of imaginary \n\nparts of GF (horizontal and vertical components), Eq.6.42, serves as an intrinsic property of the \n\nmedium and therefore, its inversion can be used to retrieved subsurface soil profile.  The detailed \n\nanalysis of the procedure can be easily found in Sanchez-Sesma et al. (2011), Garc\u00eda-Jerez et al., \n\n(2016) and Pi\u00f1a-Flores et al., (2017). A brief summary of this procedure is that autocorrelation of \n\nmotion at a receiver sensor in a given direction is proportional to directional energy density \n\n(DED), and this DED is proportional to the imaginary part of Green tensor at that sensor \n\n(Sanchez-Sesma et al., 2011).   \n\nPatron et al. (2009) showed that in case of 3D homogeneous elastic half space, the horizontal \n\ndisplacement (radial and transverse) has fix energy proportion (e.g., \n\n                                                       .

The symbol ( \n ) shows complex conjugate \n\nprocess. The medium response in a direction m (of impulse load and acting in same direction) is \n\nindicated by    . The H/V curve obtained in this manner is linked to the intrinsic property of \nmedium. The resulted H/V curve from the diffuse-field approach might allow its inversion \n\nwithout considering any supplemented information (dispersion curve). \n\n \n\nIntegration in the horizontal wave number domain at specific frequency ( , ) is evaluated to \n\nimaginary part of Green function (Sanchez-Sesma et al., 2011). This integration in horizontal \n\nwave number domain was done to separate different elastic waves. Similarly, the contribution \n\nfrom surface and body waves is achieved by discrete wave number method like Bouchon\u2019s \n\n(2007). However, recently, Garc\u00eda-Jerez et al. (2016) adopted a new procedure to evaluate the \n\nintegral. We are following Garc\u00eda-Jerez et al (2016) procedure, here. In this procedure, the \n\nhorizontal wave number components are extended to complex wave number domain. Latter, \n\nCauchy\u2019s residue theorem was utilized to estimate the surface wave contribution at simple pole \n\nalong the real k axis (see for detail Garc\u00eda-Jerez et al., 2016). The contribution of body waves to \n\nimaginary part of Green function are estimated by integration but at discrete intervals \n\n          where     represent the half-space shear wave velocity.  For the situation of \n\n\n\n \n \n\n75 \n \n\ncoincident source and receiver, the imaginary part of Green function is given by Garc\u00eda-Jerez et \n\nal.

The \n\naccurate locations of poles for the estimation of            are found by dispersion curve in \n\n( , ) domain (see for detail Garc\u00eda-Jerez et al., 2016, Pi\u00f1a-Flores et al., 2017). For IAG borehole \n\nmodel, the H/V curve, under diffused field assumption from the given imaginary Green function \n\nratios, are shown in Fig.6.8. The values of Green function given in Eq 6.43 and 6.44 are shown \n\nin Fig.6.9 for the same model. \n\nIt is noted that, in this case of DFA, the H/V modelling is resting on the assumption that noise \n\nwave field is diffused. So, the question arise naturally that, is noise wave field really diffused? If \n\nthe ambient noise wave field is diffused, it should fulfill the three criteria of general diffused \n\nfield, which are:  1) The wave field (phases) should be random; 2) Waves should come from all \n\nthe directions toward the receiver, which means that the wavefield must be isotrophic with \n\nazimuth; 3) The amplitude of incident waves should be same at a given point anywhere for a \n\nspecific spatial domain. Mulagia (2012) followed these three criteria to seek its answer and \n\nstatistically check these assumptions of diffused wavefield for seismic noise at 65 different \n\ngeographic locations of diverse geological conditions and recording environments. He showed, \n\nstatistically, that the seismic noise wave field is not diffused and the noise wave field is not \n\nazimuthally isotropic in all these cases.  \n\n \n\nFig.6. 8 Shows the H/V curve for the IAG borehole model by using full wavefield under diffused field assumption. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n76 \n \n\n \n\nFig.6. 9 Shows the imaginary part of Green function for both horizontal component             in blue, and \n\nimaginary part of Green function for vertical component for      . \n\n \n\n \n\nFig.6. 10 Show different curve comparison with that of H/V obtained from the noise tata recorded at IAG borehole \n\nsite. \n\nTo draw the conclusion from the above analysis, we can easily observe that to model the H/V \n\ncurve with surface wave domination noise field case gives a better result in a comparison with all \n\nother modeling techniques of the H/V curve (Fig 6.7). However, the shape of the H/V curve is \n\ndominated mostly by the fundamental mode of Rayleigh waves (as it present for all the \n\nfrequency range, while higher mode occurs only for specific frequencies, Fig 6.4). Hence, for the \n\ninversion of the H/V curve, it necessary to remove the effect of Love waves presence. To find \n\nthe fraction of Love waves that contributes to the noise wave field, it can be done from the 3 \n\ncomponent sensors array analysis (SPAC and FK method).

Introduction \n\n \n\nIn the previous section, we outlined all the different theoretical developments that serve as an \n\nexplanation for the H/V curve modelling. Although all these theories and explanations are used \n\nto interpret the H/V curves of experimental practices somehow equally, However, the ellipticity \n\nand DFA theory are those which require most attention. As indicated by Mulagia (2012), the \n\nnoise field is not diffused and any assumption based on such hypotheses will lead to a biased \n\ninterpretation of the data. However, any suggested theory to a physical model is an idea which is \n\ntested against reality (Pi\u00f1a-Flores et al., 2017). It can be said that every modelling technique of \n\nthe H/V is footed on some assumption, for example, Nakamura\u2019s (QTS, 1989) explanation is \n\nbased on the assumption that wave field is dominated by body waves and that horizontal and \n\nvertical motions are same at bedrock level. The Rayleigh waves ellipticity theory of the H/V \n\nmodelling is supported with the supposition of noise wave field domination by the Rayleigh \n\nwaves. The surface waves dominancy of noise wave field (Arai &amp; Tokimatsu, 2000-2004) \n\nexempt any body waves contribution. Recently, Lunedei &amp; Malischewsky (2015) reviewed the \n\ndevelopment of the H/V modelling theories over time and concluded that the two main research \n\nlines are the ellipticity of Rayleigh wave and diffused field assumption for the explanation of the \n\nH/V curve technique. The H/V curve was first utilized only for the H/V peak frequency \n\nassociation with the fundamental frequency    of the site (Nakamura 1989, 2000). The peak \n\nfrequency of the experimental curve match with S-resonance frequency of site when high S-\n\nwave velocity contrasts exists between soil and bedrock (SESAME, 2004). However, the overall \n\nshape of the experimental H/V curve is generally higher than the ellipticity curve, except at the \n\npeak of the H/V curve (Tokimatsu, 1997; also see Fig.7.1). At the peak of the ellipticity, the \n\nvertical component vanishes and the peak of the ellipticity curve is elevated as compared to the \n\nexperimental curve. This mismatch between the amplitude of the curves is attributed to the \n\npresence of body waves around the peak frequency   . As in the case of Rayleigh waves \n\ndomination, the horizontal component vanishes, which gives rise to sufficiently higher peak, \n\ntherefore this discrepancy in peak can be associated with the effect of body and Love waves \n\npresence on the horizontal component (Parolai et al., 2005). S\u00e1nchez-Sesma et al. (2010; 2011a) \n\ncomes with a solution to consider the noise wave field as diffuse field and assumed equipartition \n\nof energy between two horizontal and vertical components or between P-waves and two \n\npolarized component of S-waves (       ) carrying 1/3 of total available energy. In this \n\nsituation, the H/V can be obtained from the ratio of the Green function imaginary part of the \n\nhorizontal and vertical components, which are obtained by the autocorrelation of the coinciding \n\nsource and receiver over a layered medium. In the coming section, we will check the deviation of \n\npeak frequency of the H/V curve from S-wave resonance frequency based on these two main \n\ntheories. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n79 \n \n\n \n\nFig.7. 1 Shows the comparison of H/V curve and the theoretical borehole ellipticity curve for the  IAG site; the blue \n\nshows the experimental H/V curve, while black line shows the borehole ellipticity curve. \n\n7.2 Peak frequency (  ) of the H/V curve \n\nAs described above, one of the main uses of the H/V curve is to identify the resonance frequency \n\n   of S-wave (fundamental period of a site that maximum S-wave displacement amplification \n\noccurs). The H/V curve generally results in a peak which corresponds to the S-wave resonance \n\nfrequency for high S-wave contrast between soil and rock. This peak frequency is used to obtain \n\nthe average velocity within the sediment package if the depth to the bedrock is known by relation \n\n         . In the same way, the fundamental frequency of the site is obtained if thickness or \n\nS-wave velocity of soil layer is known in advance. We observed that the peak frequencies of H/V \n\ncurves strongly depends on the average travel time of the S-wave to reach from bedrock to the \n\nsurface (       ). Analogous travel time for diffrent models will result on the same peak \n\nfrequency. This is elaborated for a simple case of one layer model with six different cases. For \n\nthe six models in Fig 7.2, model A (h=400 m, Vsoil=800 m/s, T=0.5 second), model B (h=200 \n\nm, Vsoil=400 m/s, T=0.5 second) and C (h=100 m, Vsoil=200 m/s, T=0.5 second) results on a \n\nfundamental frequency at 0.5 Hz (Fig 7.3). Similarly, the other three models, model D (h=100 m, \n\nVsoil=400 m/s, T=0.25 second), model E (h=50 m, Vsoil=200 m/s, T=0.25 second) and model F \n\n(h=40 m, Vsoil=160 m/s, T=0.25 second) results on a peak with frequency of 1.01 Hz. These \n\ncurves were obtained by the ellipticity and DFA based forward modelling. The dispersion curves \n\nof the model A, B, C and D, E, F are  also shown in Fig 7.2., which demonstrate that the \n\ndispersion of the Rayleigh waves begin at the frequency above the fundamental frequencies of \n\n0.5 and 1.01 Hz, respectively. This phenomenon was firstly observed by Tazime (1957) and \n\nScherbaum (2003), that is, at the fundamental frequency of the site the medium act as filter and \n\nall the lower frequencies are filter out. Therefore, the dispersion of Rayleigh waves is only \n\nvisible above the fundamental frequency of the site. \n\n0.01 \n\n0.1 \n\n1 \n\n10 \n\n0.2 5.2 10.2 15.2 \n\nE\nll\n\nip\nti\n\nci\nty\n\n a\nm\n\np\nli\n\ntu\nd\n\ne\n r\n\na\nti\n\no\n \n\nFrequency (Hz) \n\nH/V curve \n\nBorehole \nellipticity  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n80 \n \n\n \n\nFig.7. 2 Shows the (a) Vp and (b) Vs profiles for six different models. The corresponding dispersion curves are also \n\ngiven for the six models (c). \n\n \n\nFig.7. 3 Shows the H/V curve obtained via ellipticity (a) and DFA approach (b) for six different models shown in \n\nFig.7.2. \n\nWe analysed the effects of different seismic wave field contributions around the peak frequency \n\nand their deviations from the S-wave resonance frequency, by considering three different \n\nsituations: (a) only the presence of the Rayleigh waves; (b) the effect of both the Rayleigh and \n\nLove waves; (c) the equal contribution from all the seismic wave types. In case (a) the exact \n\nellipticity is estimated for layered Earth case by the Dunkin (1965) formulation, following the \n\neigenvalue problem described in Thomson (1950) and Haskell (1953). Ellipticity is computed \n\nfrom the full stack of the eigenvalues and the fast root search algorithm by Wathelet (2005). In \n\ncase (b), for the surface waves, the H/V is estimated by a method proposed by Arai &amp; Tokimatsu \n\n(2000, 2004). In this case, the seismic sources, that generate the waves, are assumed to be \n\ncontinuously distributed on the surface of the Earth with independent phases. The total spectral \n\npower is estimated by integration analytically on the horizontal plane. The sources that generates \n\n\n\n \n \n\n81 \n \n\nseismic waves are assumed to be located one wavelength (both surface) away to ensure surface \n\nwave arrival at the receiver. For the convergence of the power integral, Arai &amp; Tokimatsu (2000, \n\n2004) considered an exponential damping factor generated by the scattering of surface waves in \n\nthe subsoil layered model. In case (c) the DFA and H/V are estimated from the autocorrelation of \n\na coinciding source and receiver (S\u00e1nchez-Sesma et al., 2010; 2011a). This autocorrelation \n\nresults on the imaginary part of the Green function. The H/V is obtained from the square root \n\nratio of the combined horizontal and vertical imaginary part of the Green function. \n\nThe deviation of the peak frequency from S-wave resonance is demonstrated for IAG and a \n\nsecond model is taken from Hobiger et al. (2013). The peak frequency shift is obtained for the \n\nPoisson ratio ranges from 0 to 0.5. The Poisson ratio varied by changing the shear wave velocity \n\nof the first layer,    . For this range of Poisson ratios, the H/V curves were obtained by forward \n\nmodelling by considering the seismic wave field of the three previous cases. The peak \n\nfrequencies deviation from the S-wave resonance frequency is shown in Fig 7.5a. The relative \n\nerrors of the frequencies peak for each case with S-wave resonance frequency are shown in Fig \n\n7.5b. It can be observed in Fig 7.5b that by considering the contribution from all the type of \n\nwaves around, the peak shows little relative error with S-wave resonance frequency for all \n\nPoisson ratio range. However, the relative error in frequency estimated for Rayleigh and surface \n\nwaves case is less than 10% for the Poisson ratio range 0.4 to 0.5. Similarly, the relative error \n\nbetween the S-wave frequencies is shown at Hobiger et al (2013) model in Fig.7.6c. Again, the \n\nrelative error in frequencies estimated for Poisson ratio 0.4 to 0.5 is lesser. The typical range of \n\nPoisson ratio for the soil of engineering importance is 0.4 to 0.5 (Sharma et al., 1990, \n\nDavidovici, 1985). The Poison ratio of 0.4 of the soil layer signify that Vp in the soil layer \n\nshould be 2.4 times higher than    . In general, this Vp is three-four times higher than S-wave \n\nvelocity in the soil layer (Nakamura 2000). So, if this is the case then even Rayleigh waves \n\ndomination of noise wave field closely match the S-wave resonance frequency.    \n\nThis analysis showed that, incorporating the contribution of body waves into the main peak of \n\nthe H/V curve, the relative error of the S-wave resonance frequency is lesser, comparatively. \n\nHowever, it still does not match completely with the S-wave resonance frequency. The reason \n\nmight be the proportion of body waves considered, which might not be the true one as in the case \n\nof DFA, where an equal contribution is considered for all the seismic waves. Concerning the \n\nexperimental procedure of the H/V, mismatch with Rayleigh waves ellipticity indicates that the \n\npeak of the H/V curve contains the effect of both body and surface waves (Hobiger et al., 2009). \n\nThat is why the peak of the H/V curve closely follows S-wave resonance frequency (SESAME \n\n2004) as compared to the other case of wave dominancy around the peak.  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n82 \n \n\n \n\nFig.7. 4 Shows (a) the change in Poisson values by changing Vs0 value of soil layer by considering Rayleigh waves \n\n(a) ; (b) Surface wave contribution only ; (b) shows the peak frequency of all wave. \n\n \n\nFig.7. 5 Shows the (a) the peak frequencies deviation from S-wave resonance; (b) the relative error between \n\ndifferent wave contributed H/V curve and S-wave resonance. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n83 \n \n\n \n\nFig.7. 6 Shows the (a) Vp and Vs0 of the soil layer changing which corresponded to Poisson ratio variation (b) the \n\npeak frequencies as a function of Poisson ratio (c) the relative error between different wave contributed H/V curve \n\nand S-wave resonance. \n\n7.3 Sensitivity analysis of the peak frequency    for ellipticity and DFA H/V curves \n\nAs described above, at present the two main modelling techniques commonly used for the \n\nexperimental H/V curve modelling are ellipticity and DFA (diffused field assumption). We have \n\nalso discussed that the most important information derived from the H/V curve is the peak \n\nfrequency of the curve, and hence, important information about the site are estimated from this \n\npeak frequency such as thickness and Vs0 (Parolai, 2002, Ibs-von Seht, 1999, Tuan, 2015). It is \n\nof prime importance to check the sensitivity of these peaks for both ellipticity and DFA H/V \n\ncurves to the layer parameters Vp,Vs, h and ? (P-wave velocity, S-wave velocity, thickness and \n\ndensity of mass). This analysis is done under the assumption that. apart from modelling a \n\nphysical problem, it is of equal importance that the modelling solution should be sensitive to the \n\nreal Earth properties as well. So, our aim was to check which of the H/V modelling techniques \n\n\n\n \n \n\n84 \n \n\n(DFA or ellipticity) give more sensitivity to the Earth parameters that it should be more suited to \n\nbe adopted for the inversion for H/V curve. \n\nXia (1999) analysed different layer parameters (Vs, Vp, ? and h) that can affect the shape of the \n\nRayleigh waves dispersion curve for a given model. The goal was to find that parameter which \n\naffects less or more the dispersion curve. By knowing the less affecting parameter, it can be \n\nomitted from the inversion analysis to reduce the number of the unknown during the inversion. \n\nThe Rayleigh-wave phase velocity (dispersion curve) is the complicated function of four \n\nparameters: S-wave velocity, P-wave velocity, density ? and thickness of the layer h.  Xia (1999) \n\nobserved that the most affecting parameters influencing the Rayleigh-wave phase velocity curve \n\nare the shear wave velocity, thickness, density and primary wave velocity, respectively. Here, we \n\nmodified Xia (1999) dispersion curve and re-plotted it as slowness vs frequency (slowness is \n\nused to clearly observed the effect of parameters variation on higher frequencies). The frequency \n\nrange used for the analysis is 0.2 Hz to 20 Hz (this range of frequencies is commonly used for \n\nH/V curve for the near surface engineering application). The model used for demonstration is \n\ntaken from Xia (1999, Fig7.7). The effect of these four parameter changes is displayed in Fig \n\n7.8.  \n\n \n\nFig.7. 7 Model used by Xia (1999) for finding out the sensitivity of Rayleigh wave dispersion curve for different \n\nparameters (solid line shows the profile of Vs, while dotted line the Vp profile). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n85 \n \n\n \n\nFig.7. 8 Shows the contributions to Rayleigh-wave phase velocity by 25% changes in each model parameter  (Vs, \n\nVp, ? and h). The solid black line (not visible clearly due to overlapping of density and P-wave change based \n\ndispersion curve) is Rayleigh-wave phase slowness attributed to the Earth model. The dispersion of each parameter \n\nchange is shown in with different colours (modified from Xia 1999). \n\n \n\nIn the same manner, the modelling of the H/V curve is done for layered Earth model where each \n\nlayer are characterized by properties of Vs, Vp, ? and h. Checking the most affecting parameters \n\non the peak frequency of the H/V (ellipticity and DFA approach) that will be detailed in this \n\nsection. Usually, the analysis should be done with real data to check the sensitivity of these four \n\nparameters (shear wave velocity, thickness, density and primary wave velocity) on the peak of \n\nthe curve. However, to test the effect of one parameter on the peak frequency (i.e., Vs) the other \n\nparameters (Vp, h, ?) should be kept constant to observe its influence clearly. However, in real, \n\nsuch a preferred situation is approximately impossible. Therefore, the only scenario left is to \n\ncheck the effect of this parameter for different models with forward modelling and simulation \n\nwith the two mostly used procedures for the H/V modelling/inversion. The positive side of such \n\nanalysis is that at a single time one of the parameters (Vs, Vp, ? and h) of the ground model is \n\naltered, while keeping all the other properties fixed. The change with H/V peak and shape is \n\ndocumented for this parameter variation and a general behaviour identification for later use. The \n\nIAG and Hobiger et al. (2013) models are used for this analysis, too. The models have four \n\nlayers over the bedrock at 55 m and 200 m (Fig7.9). These four layers velocity were reduced to a \n\nsediment package of one layer over the bedrock to easily handle different parameters change \n\nanalysis and also for the fact that H/V analysis are sensitive to the travel time taken by S-wave to \n\nreach the surface from bedrock (Fig 7.9).  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n86 \n \n\n \n\nFig.7. 9 Shows IAG-and Hobiger models, (a) and (c); solid line shows Vs profiles, while dashed lines show Vp \n\nprofiles. (b) and (d) are the IAG and Hobiger models reduced to one layer above the bedrock (Vs profiles only).  \n\n7.3.1 Thickness (h), density, P-wave and S-wave velocities effects on the peak frequency \n\nFrom the sensitivity analysis, we found that the first parameter, which affects the peak frequency \n\nof the H/V curve (for both ellipticity and DFA) the most, is the thickness (h) of the soft sediment \n\npackage. This effect of thickness on the peak frequency (fundamental frequency) has been \n\nobserved extensively by Scherbaum (2003). Here, we extended this analysis to the deviation of \n\nthe H/V peak frequency from the S-wave resonance and also included the DFA based H/V curve \n\nin the analysis. The scheme is to change (increase and decrease, respectively) the sediments \n\npackage thickness by 50%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10% and 5% of the original thickness (IAG model, \n\n55 m and Hobiger model, 200 m; Fig.7.10). The peak frequency of the H/V curve is observed to \n\nthe shift toward the lower frequencies in case of increasing thickness, while shifted toward \n\nhigher frequencies in case of decreasing thickness of the sediment package for both ellipticity \n\nand DFA approach H/V curves (Fig. 7.11). Both the Rayleigh waves ellipticity and DFA \n\napproach H/V show a similar trend in shifting the peak trend. The shift of peak frequency from \n\nthat S-wave resonance frequencies are shown in Fig. 7.12. The deviation in peak frequencies \n\nfrom the S-wave resonance frequencies in case of IAG is greater compared to the Hobiger model \n\ncase (Fig 7.12a,b). This shift of ellipticity peak from S-wave resonance frequencies is higher \n\nalmost 11% for different thicknesses. However, we observed that the peak frequencies of the \n\nellipticity curve closely match the S-wave resonance frequencies when the Vs-contrast between \n\nsoil and bedrock is 3.6 or higher (see, for example, Fig 7.19). The Vs value for the rock of IAG \n\nmodel we used is 1300 m/s, while for the soil we used 400 m/s, which give a Vs contrast of 3.25 \n\nlesser than the 3.6. So, we increased the Vs contrast up to 3.6 by taking bedrock velocity at 1440 \n\nm/s. This Vs contrast increase when checked for the thickness variation and compared with S-\n\nwave resonance frequency gives a deviation of almost less than 5% overall (Fig 7.13c). The \n\ndeviation in peak frequencies between ellipticity curve and that of the S-wave resonance \n\nfrequency is even less than 3% in Hobiger model case, where the Vs-contrast is 4.6 between soil \n\nand bedrock velocities. This analysis shows that for high-velocity contrast (3.6 or higher) the \n\ndeviation of ellipticity peak from S-wave resonance frequency is less than 5%. So, we can say \n\n\n\n \n \n\n87 \n \n\nthat in the case of high-velocity contrast the ellipticity modelling of H/V gives a satisfactory \n\nresult for the S-wave resonance frequency. \n\n \n\nFig.7. 10 Shows the thickness variation for IAG and Hobiger models. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig.7. 11 Shows changes in thickness vs change in frequency peak of ellipticity curve; the peak shifted toward the \n\nlower and high frequencies with increase and decrease of thickness, respectively, for both ellipticity DFA \n\napproaches. Colours are assigned to each increase and decrease along with Vs profile. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n88 \n \n\n \n\nFig.7. 12 Shows the deviation from fundamental frequencies of S-wave with that of ellipticity curve and DFA based \n\nH/V curve. (a) IAG model, (b) Hobiger model and (c) IAG with high Vs-contrast 3.6. \n\nThe second and third checked parameters which effect on the peak frequency, for both the \n\napproaches, were density (?) and P-wave velocity contrast (Fig. 7.14 and 7.16). The P-wave \n\nvelocity contrast and density contrast changes have no effect on the peak frequency of both \n\nellipticity and DFA curves (it is shown at IAG model). \n\n \n\nFig.7. 13 Shows the Vp, Vs and density profiles of IAG-borehole. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n89 \n \n\n \n\nFig.7. 14 Shows H/V curve obtained via Rayleigh wave ellipticity (a) and DFA approaches (b) against density \n\nchanges between soil and rock interface. \n\n. \n\nFig.7. 15 Shows the Vp velocity contrast profile of IAG-borehole. \n\n \n\nFig.7. 16 H/V curve obtained via Rayleigh wave ellipticity (a) and DFA approaches (b) against P-wave velocity \n\ncontrast changes between soil and rock interface. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n90 \n \n\nThe last parameter checked for the effect on the peak frequency was shear-wave velocity contrast \n\nfor both the Rayleigh waves ellipticity and DFA approaches. Velocity contrast was changed \n\nrelatively between sediment package and bedrock (Fig.7.17). The shear wave velocity ratio \n\nbetween bedrock and sediments packages were kept 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.5, 2, 1.5 and 1.2, \n\nrespectively. The peak frequency of the H/V against Vs contrast is having a clear peak when the \n\nVs ratio of sediment and bedrock is 2.5 or higher, for both the cases. The ellipticity peak \n\nfrequency deviation from the S-wave resonance frequency is less than 7% when the Vs contrast \n\nbetween soil and bedrock is 3.6 or higher. We observed for both the cases of thickness variation \n\nand velocity contrast variation, that the deviation from the S-wave resonance frequency are lesser \n\n(less than 5% of thickness variation and less than 7% for Vs-contrast) when the Vs contrast is 3.6 \n\nor higher. Though, experimental H/V curves, most of the time, failed to reproduce the amplitude \n\nof the ellipticity curve. However, the analysis showed that, in the case of high-velocity contrast \n\n(3.6 or higher), the ellipticity modelling of H/V curve matched with S-wave resonance frequency \n\nclosely, except at peak amplitude (Fig 7.1).  \n\n \n\nFig.7. 17 Shows the Vs profile along with  Vs velocity contrast profile with Vs contrast among soil and bedrock: (a) \n\nIAG-model; (b) Hobiger model. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n91 \n \n\n \n\nFig.7. 18 Shows the shape of the H/V curve obtained via Rayleigh wave ellipticity for IAG model (a), for Hobiger \n\nmodel (c),  and DFA approach for IAG (b) and for the Hobiger model (d), against S-wave velocity contrast changes \n\nbetween soil and rock interface. \n\n \n\nFig.7. 19 (a) shows the plot of ellipticity peak frequency shift with Vs contrast increase; (b) shows the ratio of \n\ntrough frequency to that of peak frequency of ellipticity; (c) shows the combined plot;  the vertical black line shows \n\nthe Vs ratio 2.6 from where the effect Vs contribute smoothly. \n\nWe observed that another strange behaviour of peak frequency is the shift of the peak frequency \n\nwith Vs contrast (Fig.7.20). The trend of the peak frequency shift showed that when the Vs \n\ncontrast is lower than 2.61, the peak frequency of H/V increases rapidly until the Vs contrast of \n\n\n\n \n \n\n92 \n \n\n2.61. Afterward, the frequency of the peak decreases and stabilizes to a constant value with \n\nincreasing Vs contrast. Similarly, another observation made by Konno &amp; Ohmachi (1998) that \n\npeak to trough frequency ratio is almost 2 for high Vs contrast and higher Poisson value soil \n\nlayer. The peak to trough ratio decreases with Vs contrast until 2.61, and then stabilizes to a \n\nconstant value of 2.1 above Vs contrast 3.6.  \n\n \n\nFig.7. 20 Shows the combined plot of ellipticity peak frequency shift with Vs contrast increase (green) and the ratio \n\nof peak to trough frequency (red). The vertical bar indicates the Vs contrast 2.61 from where both curve stabilize.  \n\nThe peak frequency analysis of these parameters variation and their deviation from the resonance \n\nfrequency show that, in the case of considering the contribution of all the seismic phases around \n\nthe peak frequency, a very little deviation from the S-wave resonance frequency is expected. \n\nSimilarly, in the case of higher Vs velocity contrast (3.6 or higher), the ellipticity peak deviation \n\nfrom the S-resonance frequency is very little. For the inversion procedure, this peak frequency \n\nregion contains very undefined contributed seismic phases and should not be considered for the \n\ninversion around this peak frequency of the experimental H/V curve. \n\n7.4 The shape of the H/V curve \n\nAs we discussed in the previous section, around the peak of H/V, the contribution to the \n\nhorizontal component might be attributed to the Love and body waves presences due to the \n\nreason that the amplitude of the curve never reproduce the ellipticity curve at peak (Tazime, \n\n1957) (Scherbaum, 2003). In this case, it follows the shear wave resonance frequency closely. \n\nNow, to view the whole shape of the H/V that what type of wave dominates the shape of the H/V \n\ncurves, we took five models from the different areas and estimated the H/V curve for all the \n\nmajor modelling techniques discussed in chapter 6. The shapes of the curves for these different \n\nmodeling cases are compared at Fig. 7.22. It is clear that in all the cases the modelled curve is \n\nfollowing the Rayleigh waves fundamental mode ellipticity shape. It is, therefore, very \n\nstraightforward to say that the overall shape of the H/V curve is controlled by the Rayleigh wave \n\nellipticity, while deviation of amplitude at peak is controlled by the presence of body/Love \n\nwaves on horizontal component. The discrepancy in amplitude for the whole curve is controlled \n\n0 \n\n0.5 \n\n1 \n\n1.5 \n\n2 \n\n2.5 \n\n3 \n\n3.5 \n\n4 \n\n1.2 2 2.8 3.6 4.4 5.2 6 6.8 7.6 8.4 9.2 10 \n\nP\ne\n\na\nk\n\n f\nre\n\nq\n.(\n\nH\nz)\n\n &amp;\n P\n\ne\na\n\nk\n t\n\nro\nu\n\ng\nh\n\n \nra\n\nti\no\n\n \n\nVs .

Recently, Pina-Flores et al., (2017) \n\nshowed that the H/V curve is dominated by the surface waves above the peak frequency, while \n\nbelow the peak frequency the effect of body waves dominate the noise wavefield. The idea of the \n\nimportance of the Rayleigh wave ellipticity can be easily established by observing the shape of \n\nthe H/V curve in terms of peak and trough coincidence (Fig 7.22). The DFA based H/V curve in \n\nall the model's cases closely follow the shape of Rayleigh waves ellipticity peak and trough (Fig \n\n7.22).  \n\n \nFig.7. 21 Shows the Vs profiles of the models used for the comparison of H/V curve for Rayleigh wave ellipticity \n\nmodeling and Diffuse field assumptions modeling for Green function.

If the shapes are changing, \n\nwhat is the number of layers, up to which the H/V curve for both the DFA and ellipticity \n\napproaches, is sensitive to the subsurface layer structure till the bedrock? The two H/V \n\nmodelling techniques were utilized (ellipticity of Rayleigh wave and DFA) to demonstrate this. \n\nThe models used for this forward modelling analysis are IAG-borehole and one taken from \n\nGreece (Lontsi, 2015; Fig 7.21). The Greece model was taken because it has the maximum \n\nnumber of layers among the models (Fig 7.21). The number of layers of both the models is \n\nincreased in such way that peak frequency of the curves should not vary more than ?5% of the \n\noriginal peak frequency of the one layer model by adjusting the S-wave average travel time. The \n\nnumber of layers is increased from 1 layer over half space to 10 layers over half space (bedrock) \n\nfor both the models. The deviation of the curve shape from one layer model upon increasing the \n\nnumber of the layer are found as \n\n                      \n \n\n \n  \n\n           \n \n\n   \n     \n\n \n\n         \n                               (7.1) \n\n \n\nwhere           is H/V curve at frequency fi for one layer model,  \n \n\n   \n     is H/V curve at \n\nfrequency fi for n layer model (n=2,3,4....10), N is the number of data point, 100 in this case. Eq. \n\n7.1 measures the mean deviation of n-layer model relative to one-layer model. Higher is the \n\n                       mean more sensitivity to the number of layers. For both modelling \n\ntechniques, the                       is estimated with different number of layers. The results \n\nare shown in Fig 7.24 and 7.25.  They show that the deviation between for different number of \n\nlayers relative to one-layer model is higher in case of  Rayleigh waves ellipticity case, while \n\nlower in DFA based on H/V curves for different layers model.  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n95 \n \n\n  \n\nFig.7. 23 ows the IAG and Greece models with a different number of layers. \n\n \n\nFig.7. 24 Shows IAG model with a different number of layers for both ellipticity (a) DFA H/V modelling \n\napproaches (b) with corresponding shape deviation from one layer model in (c) and (d). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n96 \n \n\nThis analysis indicated that maximum deviation between the shape of the H/V curve relative to \n\none-layer model when the number of layers of the subsurface target is 3 and 6 for  both ellipticity \n\nand DFA based H/V curve for IAG model (Fig.7.24) and 6 for ellipticity and DFA for Greece \n\nmodel. Beyond this threshold number of layers, the deviation of the shape curve relative to one-\n\nlayer model again decreased. Based on this analysis we can say that the maximum possible \n\nnumber of layers up to which the H/V curve is capable of carrying information and could be \n\nretrievable is 6. However, this does not mean that it should be fixed to the number of layers to be \n\n6 layers in each of the H/V inversion case (when considering H/V curve as ellipticity curve). The \n\nnumber of layers for each inversion case should be started with a simple case of one layer, and \n\nthen increased to the number of the layer by looking at the misfit. A general layers number used, \n\nfor almost all the case till now, for the H/V and dispersion curve inversion is 4 (Hobiger, 2013 \n\nand Wathelet, 2008). It is recommended that, in the case when there is no prior information \n\nabout the subsurface structure, the usual number of the subsurface layers to be chosen for the \n\ninversion is 4.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig.7. 25 Shows Greece model with a different number of layers for both ellipticity and DFA H/V modelling \n\napproaches (b) with corresponding shape deviation from one layer model in (c) and (d). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n97 \n \n\nChapter 8: The use of peak frequency of the H/V curve \n\n \n\n8. Thickness frequency relation \n\nThe characteristic site period, that depends on the thickness and shear wave velocity of the soil \n\n(as described in the previous chapter), provides a very useful sign of the vibration period at \n\nwhich the most significant amplification can be expected. Despite of the knowledge of types of \n\nwave which dominates the result of the H/V curve around the peak, luckily, for the purposes of \n\nestimating the soft sediment thickness, the H/V technique can be employed for the measurement \n\nof resonance frequency (Konno &amp; Omachi, 1998; Ibs-von Seht &amp; Wohlenberg, 1999; SESAME \n\n2004; Bonnefoy-Claudet et al., 2008; Tuan et al., 2011) which can be used to obtained sediment \n\nthickness above the seismic bedrock. In the case of the H/V curves, as it has been observed \n\nextensively, the peak of H/V curve corresponds to the shear wave resonance with good accuracy \n\n(SESAME, 2004). This simple method of ambient seismic noise recording provides us \n\ninformation about the fundamental period or fundamental frequency (f_0) of a site, which plays a \n\nvery important role in hazard mitigation analysis such as earthquake microzonation. A relation \n\nbetween the fundamental resonance frequency and thickness of the soft soil can be estimated for \n\nthe control point (borehole), which later can be utilized for a larger area. This thickness \n\nfrequency relationship is usually found out by the regression analysis of thickness and peak \n\nfrequencies obtained for those boreholes sites. This     relationship strongly depends on the \n\nshear wave velocity and thickness of soil and, hence, relies on the average travel time of shear \n\nwave in the soil package (as shown for six different models in chapter 7). To obtain this     \n\nrelationship for an area, there should be borehole control points scattered in the study area, where \n\nit should measure the ambient noise and estimate the H/V curve for peak frequency retrieval to \n\nmake a relation between thickness of soil from boreholes and these peak frequencies. However, \n\nthese desired situations often do not meet. Here, in this section, we are suggesting to estimate \n\nthis     relation with the help of dispersion curve (obtained with any active source technique \n\nSASW or MASW). This new procedure is highlighted for the two theoretical models and used \n\nlatter for the Bebedouro area, where we have ambient noise measurements at seven borehole \n\nsites and have six MASW survey profiles to utilize the dispersion curves. \n\nIn most cases, the trend of velocity increases with depth in recent deposit sediments. This \n\nincrease in the velocity is associated with the compaction caused by lithostatic load increase. \n\nFaust (1951) analysed experimental data and proposed a non-linear relationship between Vp (P-\n\nwave velocity), Z (depth ) and    (age of the strata). \n\n           \n \n\n   (8.1) \n\nChandler (2005) generalized it for the shallow sedimentary structure (&lt;4 km) on the basis of the \n\nexperimental data. The Chandler empirical relationship can be written with little modification as  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n98 \n \n\n       \n \n\n                       (8.2) \n\n \n\nwhere       is the average shear wave velocity with depth Z and    is the velocity at one meter \n\ndepth. Usually, the trend velocity is estimated from one meter depth onward. Therefore, the \n\ndepth Z, to put Z=z+1 in eq.8.2, it becomes as \n\n \n\n             \n             (8.3) \n\n \n\nIn general form, eq.8.3 can be written as  \n\n \n\n             \n           (8.4) \n\n \n\nwhere x is the shear wave velocity increase its dependence according to depth. As it is obvious \n\nfrom Eq.8.4, the values of    and x are required to get the general increase trend of shear wave \n\nvelocity. Usually, these values are estimated from the borehole data analysis. Both these values \n\nvary from site to site. The literature review on this topic provide three general relations \n\n(Albarello, 2011) for the different geological setting  \n\n \n\n?   = 210 m/s and x= 0.20 for compact soils \n?    =170 m/s and x =0.25 for sands \n?    =110 m/s and x =0.40 for rework or very recent soils \n\n \n\nDeriving the formula for thickness frequency relationship, let\u2019s assume that a trend velocity \n\nincrease in the unconsolidated soil deposit it is in the form of Eq. 8.4.

As Eq.8.9 is derived based on \n\naverage time taken by shear wave velocity to travel through the soil deposit of thickness h, so \n\nlet\u2019s call this relation as time based thickness frequency relation. The appearance of      in Eq \n\n8.9 suggest the idea that the relation between thickness and frequency will have different a and b \n\nvalues for different areas (as      will have different values for each site).  For example, the two \n\nthickness-frequency relation developed for Cologne, Germany and the western Lower Rhine \n\nEmbayment, Germany are given as \n\n \n\n       \n        (Parolai 2002)        (8.10)  \n\n      \n       (Ibs-von Seht 1999)        (8.11) \n\nEq. (8.10 and 8.11) are developed from the regression analysis of the H/V peaks and the depth of \n\nthe bedrock from the borehole control points. As described above, the thickness frequency \n\nrelationship for different localities will have different a and b values because of the \n\ndifferent     . Therefore, in general, fixing values of these constants a and b will be certainly \n\nbias to each geological setting. Another thickness frequency relationship was recently derived by \n\nTuan et al. (2015). He used the transfer matrix (Haskel, 1953) method to derive an explicit \n\nequation for the multi layered situations with fixed bottom. These approximate equations are \n\n\n\n \n \n\n100 \n \n\nthen generalized for the model of a functionally graded material (FGM) layer over the half-space \n\n(Eq.8.12). The positive side of this formulation is considered by deriving the effect of density \n\nand the position of sub-layers (for more detail, look at Tuan, 2015). \n\n \n\n   \n  \n\n      \n\n  \n  \n\n \n\n      \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n            (8.12) \n\n \n\n8.1 How to estimate the value of       \n\n \n\nBoth in Eq.8.9 and 8.12, the two unknowns  are the shear wave velocity at one-meter depth and \n\nthe shear wave velocity increase trend (x), which is generally find out from the borehole velocity \n\nanalysis. However, it is difficult to have a calibration of borehole for these values at each site. \n\nHere, we are suggesting and estimating these values        from the phase velocity dispersion \n\ncurve. To elaborate the procedure, the analysis is initially made for the two theoretical 1D \n\nmodels (A and B, Fig.8.1). The values of       can be indirectly obtained from the interpretation \n\nof the effective Rayleigh wave dispersion curve. The fundamental mode of Rayleigh wave \n\ndispersion curve coincides with the above framework of rough idea of estimation parameter \n\n      (Albarello et. al., 2011). Some authors have suggested, on the basis of empirical evidence, \n\nthat the average S-wave velocity up to a depth of h roughly corresponds to the relative Rayleigh \n\nwaves phase velocity to a fixed wavelength of the order of 1 \u00f7 3 times h (Konno &amp; Kataoka, \n\n2000; Martin &amp; Diehl, 2004; Albarello &amp; Gargani, 2010). According to relation, the Rayleigh \n\nwave velocity approximately matches with S-wave average velocity up to bedrock depth \n\n(Albarello, 2011)\n \n \n\n \n\n      =1.1VR(f)  as  h=(\n   \n\n   \n \n     \n\n \n)        (8.13) \n\n \n\nEq.8.13 gives an idea that dispersion curve obtained from the MASW, or any other array \n\ntechnique, can be utilized to infer the values of     . In this case, we are using the best fitting \n\ntechnique between shear wave velocity and depth obtained from the dispersion curve directly for \n\nthe two models (A, B). For each point of the dispersion curve, shear wave velocity and depth are \n\nestimated by using a rough approximation \n\n \n\n     = 1.1VR(f)     Depth h = \n     \n\n  \n          (8.14) \n\n\n\n \n \n\n101 \n \n\nThe model A contains four layers over the half space at 200 meter (the composite thickness of \n\nsoft sediments is 200 m, Fig 8.1.a), while model B is considered to have the same number of \n\nlayers over the half space at 100 meter depth (Fig 8.1b). The number of layers above the half \n\nspace is arbitrary, as our focus is to find the composite thickness of soil over the bedrock (half \n\nspace in this case).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig.8.1 Model A and B. (a) and (b) show Vs profiles (solid lines) while dash line show average S-velocity trend \n\nobtained from best-fitting;  (c) shows fundamental mode dispersion curve for models A and B; (d) shows the \n\nfundamental mode ellipticity curve for both models. \n\n \n\nThe theoretical dispersion curve of the fundamental mode was estimated using Dunkin (1965) \n\nformulation, which was modified from Thomson (1950) and Haskel (1953) following an \n\neigenvalue problem. The theoretical ellipticity curve is estimated for the models A and B (Fig \n\n8.1d) from a stack of eigenvalues for each layer. The stepwise procedure adopted were: 1. The \n\ndispersion and ellipticity were estimated for the models A and B (Fig 8.1c,1d);  2. The shear \n\nwaves velocity and depth were estimated for each Rayleigh-frequency points (100 points are \n\nconsidered for theoretical models) of dispersion curve using Eq. 8.13; additionally, peaks of \n\nellipticities curves for model A and B are considered as fundamental frequency       \n\n                     Fig.8.1d); 3. The best fit was passed through shear wave velocity and \n\ndepth points and the rate of increase of the shear wave velocity with depth x was obtained (Fig \n\n\n\n \n \n\n102 \n \n\n8.2); 4. The    values were estimated from            , where V was the velocity at the \n\nsurface estimated from the best fit (it can also be roughly approximated from the VRayleigh \n\ndispersion curve values at higher frequency when available).  \n\nThe values obtained from this procedure for the theoretical models (A:                , \n\nB:      )= 112, 0.40) were input to the Eq.8.12, and composite thickness for soft sediment over \n\nbedrock were estimated (A: h=205.8 m, B: h=104.5 m by Tuan relation Eq8.12 and A: h=174 m, \n\nB: h=81 m by average time based on relation Eq 8.9). The analysis of the theoretical models \n\nresults for the thickness estimations suggest that Tuan (2015) relation provides a better estimate \n\nin contrast to the average time travel based relation. The same procedure can be adopted for \n\nactual field cases, and  will be further investigated in the coming section. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig.8.2 The best-fit line through Vs-depth plot for model A (top) and (B) bottom; the rate of increase of average \n\nshear wave velocity obtained is b=0.35 for A (top); the same procedure is done for model B which result in b =0.40 \n(bottom). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n103 \n \n\n8.2 Thickness frequency relation for the Bebedouro area \n\nIn the Bebedouro area, the seismic noise measurement was made next to seven water wells \n\nwhere we know the exact depth of sandstone and basalt interfaces from the drilling information. \n\nThe seismic noise measurement was made next to these water wells. The fundamental \n\nfrequencies of these water wells sites were estimated from the H/V analysis (Fig.8.3, Table 8.1) \n\nand linked to the sandstone top by the regression analysis to find the thickness frequency relation \n\nfor the Bebedouro area (Fig 8.4). The Bebedouro area contains two geological interfaces near the \n\nsurface, soft sediments followed by sandstone layer and fractured basalt. However, we could not \n\nfind any prominent peak for the basalt interface as the velocity contrast were not might sufficient \n\nto result in a peak for the basalt sandstone interface. Therefore, we limited the       relation of \n\nthe soil and top of the sandstone layer (Fig.8. 4). The regression analysis equation has an average \n\nerror of  ? 8% (minimum 1% and maximum 15%) with actual thickness estimated from the \n\nwells. This result will be compared with the results of Eq 8.9 and Eq.8.12. Prior to that, let\u2019s find \n\nout the      for the sites. \n\nTable 8. 1 Peak frequencies of noise recording made next to water wells. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig.8.3 Shows the H/V curves measured at borehole sites given in Table 8.1. \n\nWell name Prominent peak of \n\nH/V     (Hz) \nTop of sandstone (m) from well \n\nP11 3 27 \n\nP09 2.6 42 \n\nP04 4.2 22 \n\nP02 7.5 7 \n\nP03 7.2 7 \n\nPST2 6 12 \n\nStaAna1 6 11 \n\n\n\n \n \n\n104 \n \n\n \n\nFig.8.4 Shows the regression plot for H/V curve peaks and depth to bedrock (sandstone) in Bebedouro area (x is \n\nresonance frequency, R-Square is the coefficient of determination, f(x) thickness to soil deposit. \n\n8.3       values estimation for the Bebedouro area from MASW dispersion curve \n\nTo find the values of       for the Bebedouro area we used six MASW profiles. Four of the \n\nMASW profiles were recorded in 2008, being them BEB 4a, BEB7, BEB 11 and BEB1, and two \n\nnew profiles BEB 4b and BEB 16b were acquired  in 2015 (Fig.8.5a). The dispersion curves \n\nfrom these MASW profiles were used to estimate the shear wave velocity increase trend for the \n\nregion. The BEB 4b MASW profile was used to obtain three dispersion curves for different \n\nsource intervals (Fig.8.7). We tried to directly invert these data from the Rayleigh wave velocity-\n\nfrequency to shear wave velocity-depth through the relations           and         \n \n\n  \n   for each frequency point. The shear wave velocity is linked to Rayleigh wave phase velocity \n\nthrough Poisson ratio such as \n  \n\n  \n \n\n          ?\n\n  ?\n (where    is the Rayleigh wave phase velocity,    is \n\nthe shear wave velocity and ? is the Poisson ratio). The Poisson ratio for the near surface \n\napplication varies from 0.4 to 0.5. Therefore, let\u2019s consider the Poisson ratio is changing from 0 \n\nto 0.5. The corresponding  \n  \n\n  \n ratio to this range of Poisson ratio increases from 0.862 to 0.955. \n\nThe shear wave velocity trend obtained through the best fit line of the Vs-depth points are given \n\nin Fig 8.7. An important point to note is that, if the Vs increases, the depth trend should not vary \n\nif the surface geology of the area is not changing abruptly. All the three curves shown in Fig.8.7 \n\nwere obtained from different source-receiver intervals of the same BEB 4b site from active \n\nsource 30 meter forward (a), 15 m reverse (b), and passive source curve (c).  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n105 \n \n\n \n\nFig.8. 5 (a) The location of the seismic stations in Bebedouro area.

The velocity \n\nincrease trend was kept constant at 0.3369 in all the cases (Fig 8.8). This analysis showed that \n\n\n\n \n \n\n106 \n \n\nthe change of Poisson ratio only affect the velocity at the surface (a=V in best-fit relation) and \n\nhence, have no effect on the velocity increase trend.   \n\n \n\nFig.8.7 Shows Vs-depth data fit for the three curves (a) active 30 meter forward (b) 15 m reverse, and (c) passive \n\nsource curve; on the lower right statistical robustness and values of data fit are given. The values of (  ) and x are \n\nsame as all these curves are taken from same site MASW. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig.8.8 Shows the effect of Poisson ratio changes on velocity increase trend with depth for different Poisson ratios. \n\nThe black dots shows the Vs-depth data while the blue line shows the best fit to the data. The value of x remains \n\nconstant at 0.3369. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n107 \n \n\nThe value of the     variation for the Poisson ratio range 0 to 0.5 was found out for the IAG \n\nborehole model. The Poisson ratio was changed by changing the velocity of the soil layer and    \n\nvalues were estimated by Eq8.4 for the whole range of Poisson values. These values of    for \n\ndifferent Poisson ratios and the corresponding velocity increase trend with depth are shown in \n\nFig.8.9. Note that the value of the x used, 0.42, was estimated from the best-fit of Rayleigh wave \n\ndispersion curve for IAG model. \n\n \n\nFig.8.9 Shows the IAG model and the corresponding velocity increase trend (x= 0.42) for different Poison ratio (?) \n\nof the soil layer. The Vo values as a function of Poison ratio are given in (b). \n\nSimilarly, like Beb 4b, four other dispersion curves were obtained for different source intervals:  \n\n(a) 30 meter forward, (b) 30-meter reverse (c) 10 meter forward and (d) 10-meter reverse at BEB \n\n16b, shown in the Fig 8.10. The same procedure was applied and the best fit was passed to get a \n\nsense of increase velocity trend with depth. It is clear from the analysis of Fig 8.10 (a, b, c) that \n\nthe velocity increases with depth trend is around 0.33. However, a little increase to 0.38 in depth \n\ndependence of velocity Fig 8.10(c) is observed. This deviation in x is most probably associated \n\nwith erroneous picking off the dispersion curves. The interesting fact, which can be noted here, is \n\nthat the distance between these two sites (BEB 4b and BEB 16b) is almost 10 km from each \n\nother and still the values of x (velocity dependence on depth) are almost similar. Similarly, at the \n\nother sites (BEB 1, BEB 4a, BEB 7 and BEB 11), the dispersion curves were directly inverted \n\nand the Vs-depth trend were obtained (Fig 8.11). The fundamental mode of the dispersion curve \n\nis considered in all these cases to obtain the shear wave velocity increase trend with the depth. \n\nThe velocity dependence on depth value is the same for almost all the six MASW acquired sites. \n\nThe values of a depend on the local setting and they are highly varying only among the two sites \n\nBEB 4a and BEB 11. The four rest sites showed almost similar velocity at the very near surface. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n108 \n \n\n \n\nFig.8.10 Shows the velocity-depth increase trend for different source intervals a) 30 meter forward, (b) 30-meter \n\nreverse, (c) 10 meter forward and (d) 10-meter reverse.

The values approximated from the dispersion curve indirect inversion and \n\nfitting are taken as x=0.34 and   =171. These values were used in Eq 8.9 and 8.11 and thickness \n\nfrequency relation were obtained by \n\n                 \n      \n\n         (8.15) \n\n                          \n      \n\n       (8.16) \n\nBoth of these equations results were plotted along with the experimentally derived relation in Fig \n\n8.12. To observe the error produced in thickness estimation of all these three relations, we have \n\nplotted the estimated thickness, with the ? one standard deviation at each frequency points \n\n(Fig.8.13). The standard deviations were found out in the three thickness estimates at an each \n\ngiven frequency (0.2 to 20 Hz).

The thickness estimate values lies almost within the error bar of each \n\nother. The observation of the error estimates in thickness measurement are done by finding out \n\nthe relative error between a reference equation and the other two relations. Here, we have \n\nconsidered the average time based and Tuan (2015) relations as a reference as its derivation are \n\nbased on the mathematical background rather than empirical analysis, like regression analysis in \n\nthe Bebedouro case. Then, the relative errors were found out in the Bebedouro thickness-\n\nfrequency relation by considering as reference either the Tuan or time average equations. The \n\nrelative error are shown in Fig.8.14. The relative error plot in thickness estimates shows the \n\ndifferent zone of frequencies where the relative error of either Tuan or average time relation is \n\ngiving good results when compared to the regression-based relation. \n\nThe analysis of the relative error demonstrates an error of 1.5 % in thickness estimated at 0.1 Hz, \n\nand 15% at 20 Hz with regression relation for Tuan thickness estimate (Eq8.12) and 13 % at 0.1 \n\nHz to 2 % at 20 Hz with regression for average time relation (Eq8.9). At a glance, the average \n\nthickness estimates with time-based relation are in close proximity with regression relation. \n\nHowever, we used the Tuan relation for the situation where the dominant frequency \n\n(fundamental) of the site is 0.3 Hz up to 1.2 Hz otherwise the average time base relation for the \n\nhigher frequencies. The relative error between Tuan and average time-based relation shows a \n\nconstant error of 11% when Tuan is used as reference measure for thickness and a constant error \n\nof 12% when the average time-based relation is used as reference measure. The point where the \n\nrelative errors with regression analysis are changing is actually the point where the Tuan and the \n\naverage time-based lines cut the regression analysis equation line. \n\nIn conclusion, it can be said that in situation where the thickness frequency relation is not in hand \n\ndue to the unavailability of control (borehole) points, a dispersion curve can be used to obtain \n\nthese values of     , which can be utilized to obtain the local thickness frequency relation for a \n\nsite using Eq.8.9 and 8.12. The range of frequencies of dispersion curve used for      retrieval \n\nvalues are site dependent. To ensure a better result in fields, two different dispersion curve \n\nshould be obtained for the two nearby sites. If the dispersion curves of both the sites show the \n\ndispersion in the same frequency range, then any of the dispersion curves can be used for      \n\nretrieval values, otherwise, if one dispersion curve shows a spread in wider frequency range \n\ncompared to the other, the curve with wider frequency range should be used for this velocity and \n\nincrease trend with depth estimation for regression analysis. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n112 \n \n\n \n\nChapter 9: Part of ellipticity and misfit function \n\n \n\n9.1 Which part of ellipticity curve should be used for inversion? \n\n \n\nIn the previous two chapters, the shape and the peak frequency were analyzed in terms of wave \n\nfield and also, the importance of the peak frequency for the thickness-frequency relation. As we \n\nhave shown, the shape of the H/V curve is dominated by the Rayleigh wave ellipticity, especially \n\nfundamental mode till the first trough, thus ellipticity curve is of great interest for the subsurface \n\nstructure retrieval. However, it is first necessary to infer which part of ellipticity is carrying the \n\nmost relevant information regarding the velocity structure. In particular, the resonance frequency \n\n   is of great concern for inversion because it carries information about the depth of bedrock. \n\nHowever, as we have seen in the previous chapter, a constant travels time for the shear wave in \n\nsoft sediment has same fundamental frequency peak regardless of thickness and velocity. So, the \n\npeak of H/V curve depends on the ratio between the thickness of the soft layer and the average S-\n\nwave velocity of the sediment package. Therefore, to get the thickness of soft sediment or the \n\naverage velocity of soft soil from the H/V curve, we must have either information about the \n\nshear wave velocity of the soil or the thickness. This direct estimates obtained via    helps to \n\nconstrain the thickness of the sedimentary cover when some information such as h-    \n\nrelationship for the given area is available or knowledge about the local Vs profile are in hand. In \n\nthis section we will analyze which part of the ellipticity is carrying the most relevant  \n\ninformation of the subsurface. We will use the same model of the borehole of IAG site for this \n\nanalysis. It should be notted that ellipiticty curve alone does not provide sufficent information \n\nabout the subsurface soil structure (Scherbaum, 2003). The inversion of the dispersion and \n\nellipticity curve alone give very  differing results (Fig 9.1). The dispersion curve inversion misfit \n\nhas a clear minimum while that of ellipticity inversion gives a clear trade-off between the \n\nvelocity and thickness of soil (the dispersion and H/V curves have diffrent senstivity for the layer \n\nparameter (S-wave velocity, thickness of soil). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n113 \n \n\n \n\nFig.9.1 Shows the distribution of the misfits as a function of the surface velocity (v0) and layer thickness (d). The \n\nupper panel corresponds to the dispersion curve misfits while the lower panel corresponds to the ellipticity misfits \n\n(Scherbaum, 2003). \n\n \n\nThis trade-off in ellipticity approach can be observed by changing the number of layers of IAG \n\nmodel while keeping the same velocity contrast between the soil and bedrock. A similar \n\nellipticity curve (having a peak ?5% of one-layer frequency peak) were obtained (Fig 9.2). The \n\nvelocity structure was changed by having one to four layers in the soil above the bedrock. This \n\ngives an idea that if we try to utilize the peak frequency only for the inversion, it will provide a \n\nbiased resultThe only visible deviation at these different models ellipticities is at the right limb, \n\nwhich shows that the right flank till the minimum of the ellipticity is the important part which is \n\ncontrolled by the velocity structure of site within the soil. So, one can qualitatively guess  that \n\nthe right limb of ellipticity (from peak to trough) should be used for the inversion, because it is \n\nthe only portion of the ellipticity varying with altering the number of layers and hence, velocity \n\nstructure within the soil. Another  important point to make here is that,  at the horizontal \n\ncomponent of seismic noise wavefield the Love effect is present. The Love wave effect is more \n\nprominent at singularities (peak and trough) of the H/V. At peak frequency, the vertical \n\ncomponent of noise wavefield vanish (Bard, 1998). The total contribution around the peak is \n\nthen from the horizontal component of Rayleigh, Love and body waves. At the trough frequency, \n\nthe horizontal components of  Rayleigh wave vanish, so the total horizontal energy is attributed \n\nto the Love wave and body waves contribution. Beyond the trough frequency, the influence of \n\nhigher modes might lead to misestimating of the different Rayleigh mode ellipticities (Bard, \n\n\n\n \n \n\n114 \n \n\n1998). So, the right flank till the trough of the ellipticity seems the most reliable part of an \n\nellipticity curve for the inversion along with other information like the dispersion curve. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig.9.2 Shows the four models and their corresponding ellipticity curves. The same model of the IAG borehole by \n\nconsidering one, two, three and four layers above the bedrock. \n\nThe H/V curve techniques are strongly conditioned by the properties (thickness of sediment \n\npackage and impedance contrast) of the interface between the sediment and the bedrock (Parolai \n\net al., 2005), while it is poorly informative about the S-wave velocity of the sedimentary layers \n\n(Fig 9.1). On the other hand, the dispersion curves of the array technique (i.e., MASW) \n\nconstraint mainly the S-wave velocity structure of the subsurface soil. However, the dispersion \n\ncurve provides very uncertain information about the deep subsurface velocity structure, \n\nespecially below the fundamental frequency of a site due to the filtering effect of the media. \n\nTherefore, when either H/V or dispersion curves are used singularly for the subsurface structure \n\nretrieval, there is a un-resolvable trade-off between the model parameters (velocity and thickness \n\nof the soil layers) that hampers the inversion analysis results. So, it is usually suggested to invert \n\nH/V and the dispersion curve  jointly (Fig 9.3). However, it is a cumbersome process to map out \n\na large area by acquiring both the ambient noise and MASW measurement at each  location. \n\nSometimes one (i.e., noise recording) measurement is acquired easily while the other are difficult \n\nto acquire because of accessibility limitation (i.e., the Col\u00f4nia site swampy condition). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n115 \n \n\n \n\nFig.9.3 Showing joint inversion of ellipticity and dispersion curves. The black dotted line shows the IAG borehole \n\ndata ellipticity and dispersion curve. On the right, the result of inversion is shown; the black line shows the true \n\nmodel. \n\nIf the geology of the area where Vs measurement up to the bedrock desired has a smooth \n\ngeological setting, then we can expect that the shear wave velocity will increase smoothly with \n\ndepth (i.e., Bebedouro). The MASW measurement at some of the locations of the whole \n\ninvestigation area can be utilized to obtain this shear wave velocity increase trend for that area. \n\nThis shear wave velocity increase trend can then be used to invert the H/V curves obtained in the \n\nwhole area by using this information of Vs increase trend and velocity at near surface \n\ninformation or information about the thickness of the sediments package obtained via     \n\nrelation. As we have discussed above,  the ellipticity inversion alone always gives ambigous \n\nresult, therefore, this  addtional information of velocity (shear wave) or thickness will reduce the \n\nunresolovable trade-off between thickness and Vs velocity. \n\nForward modelling is performed to obtain the dispersion curve of the of the borehole model. This \n\ndispersion curve is indirectly inverted by using each point of dispersion curve to obtain depth \n\nand Vs value   ach point of the dispersion curve gives depth and S-wave estimate. These data  \n\nare used to plot the best fit and to obtain the general trend of S-wave velocity with depth. The \n\nvalues obtained for the IAG model were    =134 m/s and x=0.42 (Fig 9.4). These values \n\n(  =134 m/s, x=0.42 ) are used to get velocity at 55 meter (around 750 m/s). Similarly, we have \n\nseen that the most affecting parameter on the ellipticity curve is the thickness of the sediment \n\npackage following by effect of shear wave velocity. If the sediment thickness and H/V peak \n\nrelation for an area is not available, then the values    =134 m/s, x=0.42) are used to estimate \n\nthis relation. The relation can be use to find out the thickness of the sediment package (see, for \n\nexample, the previous chapter for detailed procedure). This information of thikness and Vs help \n\nto resolve this trade-off between thickness and velocity during the inversion. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n116 \n \n\n \n\nFig.9.4 Shows the shear wave velocity vs. depth trend for the theoretical model dispersion curve of IAG borehole \n\ncurve.  \n\n9.2 Inversion of the ellipticity curve with velocity trend and thickness information \n\nFor the inversion in this section, the number of layers is chosen to be four. For simple ground \n\nstructure, the inversion converges very soon after the generation of very fewer numbers of \n\nmodels. We are not studying in detail the parameterization effect on the inversion, which was \n\nalready done by Sambrige (2002) and Wathelet (2005, 2008). The parameter space for the \n\ninversion of the ellipticity curve is chosen such that shear and P-wave are allowed to change in a \n\nwide range. At the top of the sediment package, the velocity is selected as the velocity of one \n\nmeter 50-250 m/s (in case of 134 m/s) and velocity at bottom is chosen on the basis of shear \n\nwave velocity increase trend by taking thickness information into account (750 m/s). We chose \n\nthis velocity to be around 900 m/s. The velocity of bedrock is chosen to vary between 900 to \n\n3500 m/s. The number of layers from the top to the bottom of sediments package is chosen to be \n\nfour. The density is fixed at 2000 kg/m-3. The Poisson ratio is chosen to lie between 0.2 to 0.5 \n\nfor the whole sediment package. For this case of four layers model over the homogeneous half-\n\nspace, the parameter space is 14 dimensional (five Vs, five Vp and 4 thickness). The original \n\ntheoretical model is always included in ground model profiles with the misfit = 0 for the \n\ncomparison. The theoretical inversion of this or any model will converge after a long time. For \n\nan inversion algorithm, even faster than Monte Carlo, it will requires infinite time to explore the \n\ncomplete parameter space. However, the usual goal of all the inversion processes is to find a \n\nmodel with acceptable fit to the data in some practical time. The number of models generated in \n\nall the theoretical section and later in the experimental data is kept limited to 25000, as in most \n\nof the cases. The inversion convergence was good after such number of model generation. The \n\ncheck of which part of the ellipticity is carrying the most important information is done by \n\ninverting different parts of ellipticity with the supplemented information regarding thickness and \n\nvelocity at top and bottom of the sediment package. As we have the complete knowledge of the \n\nground structure, it is easy to check the quality of inversion, that is, how good the model is \n\n\n\n \n \n\n117 \n \n\nretrieved. So, it is essential to check and define a parameter to evaluate the quality (integrity of \n\nfit) of the inversion (Hobiger et al., 2013). If this integrity of fit is computed by comparing the \n\ntheoretical Vs-profile to that of lower misfit inverted model, it will be problematic because of \n\nnon-uniqueness. The inverted model may not have same layer thickness and bedrock depth with \n\nthat of the theoretical one, but will have same phase velocity dispersion curve. Hobiger et al. \n\n(2013) suggested a parameter to check the quality of inversion with that of the theoretical model, \n\ntermed it as the proximity value (T). They used this parameter to find the quality of joint \n\ninversion of autocorrelation curve with different parts of the ellipticity curve. The proximity \n\nvalue (T) is actually comparing the Rayleigh wave dispersion curve calculated for the lower \n\nmisfit (best fitted inverted) model with the reference dispersion curve of the theoretical model. \n\nThis reference dispersion curve is calculated for the given IAG theoretical model. The proximity \n\nvalue can be defined as \n\n \n\n   \n \n\n \n  \n\n             \n\n      \n \n\n \n \n             (9.1) \n\n \n\n       is the theoretical model dispersion curve,      ) is the best fitted inverted model  at \n\nfrequency (f), N is the number of frequency points. As the theoretical model dispersion curve do \n\nnot has any measuring error, the measuring error present in misfit function is replaced by \n\n      . The value of T gives, somehow, a mean deviation of the inversion model from the \n\nreference model. Hobiger et al. (2013) suggested the T value to be around 90% match with \n\nreference model (theoretical model). However, a value of less than 0.1 can considered good fit to \n\nthe model. \n\nWe checked which part of the ellipticity should be inverted to retrieve the theoretical model from \n\nthe inversion by using velocity trend and thickness information. Fig 9.5 to 9.9 show the inversion \n\nof ellipticity full (0.2Hz to 20 Hz), left limb (0.2 to 2.04 Hz), left limb-peak-right limb (1Hz-to-\n\n3Hz) , right-limb up to trough  (2Hz-to-4.5 Hz)  and part beyond the trough of the ellipticity \n\ncurve (4.5Hz-to-20Hz). The corresponding fit of the inverted models to that of theoretical and \n\nfinal model are shown in each corresponding figures (Fig. 9.6 to 9.10). Table 9.2 summarizes the \n\nresults of all these parts of inversion along with misfit and T values.  \n\nFig 9.3 shows the joint inversion of both ellipticity and dispersion curves, after the generation of \n\n25000 models. The ground model is very well retrieved. Almost all the layers and velocity are \n\nvery well retrieved. Fig 9.5 shows the inversion of the ellipticity curve only along with the shear \n\nwave velocity at the top and bottom of the sediment package obtained through dispersion curve \n\ndirect inversion. The information for the thickness of the sediment package was obtained via \n\nthickness-frequency relation. In this case, the theoretical profile is not very well retrieved as that \n\nof joint inversion case in Fig 9.3, especially the depth of first and 3rd layers. However, as the \n\n\n\n \n \n\n118 \n \n\nmain purpose of utilization of the different techniques  recommended for microzonation is to find \n\nthe average velocity of sediment package and depth of bedrock, which is of great importance for \n\nseismic motion amplification and hazard mitigation for a site, the use of shear wave velocity \n\ntrend, thickness information along with the ellipticity curve inversion serve to fulfill this desired \n\ngoal (to find average shear wave velocity of sediment package and its thickness above the \n\nseismic bedrock). The velocity of the bedrock (at 55 meters is  1300 m/s) is very well retrieved \n\nby lower misfit model.  \n\n \n\nFig.9.5 Shows the inversion of ellipticity curve along with S-velocity increase trend and thickness information. \n\n \n\nFig 9.6 shows the inversion of the left limb (0.2Hz to 2.04Hz) of the ellipticity curve. In this \n\ncase, the ground structure is not very well retrieved, although the inverted profile is very well \n\nfitted by the data of ellipticity with the lower misfit. However, the T values are high, which show \n\na bad retrieval of the model. Fig 9.7 shows the left and right limbs along with the peak of \n\nellipticity (1Hz to 3Hz). As the peak of ellipticity carries important information about the \n\nthickness of sediments, this peak frequency can be used to find sediment thickness if the local \n\nthickness-frequency relation exists. We found that the inversion result of this part is very \n\nessential for the utilization of inversion of ellipticity alone if the near surface velocity and \n\nthickness information are known in priority. Fig 9.8 shows the inversion of right limb of \n\nellipticity. The T values are lesser and the model fit to the inverted model also shows a good fit. \n\nFig 9.9 shows the inversion of the ellipticity curve above the trough. Although the data above the \n\ntrough are very well fitted by ellipticity curve, the model and T-values retrieved shows a \n\ndeviation.  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n119 \n \n\nThis analysis shows that by incorporating both limbs around the peak frequency along with \n\nvelocity trend and thickness information, the minimum misfit model is closer to the subsurface \n\nmodel. We tested the same procedure for another model taken from Picozzi et al. (2005) and \n\nfrom Lontsi (2015). The Picozzi et al. (2005) model is composed of five layers over the bedrock \n\nat depth of 240m. The frequency-thickness and S-velocity increase trend relation for the area was \n\nalready developed by Parolai et al. (2002), which was used to estimate the thickness (280 m), the \n\ntop and bottom of sediment package velocity values (50 m/s to 150 m/s and 950 m/s to 1200 \n\nm/s). The velocity of half space was considered to vary between 950 m/s-to-3500 m/s, the \n\ndensity was considered constant and the number of layers equal to eight (the number of layers \n\nwere chosen as it was used in the original study of Piccozi, 2005 and Lontsi, 2015). The \n\ninversion result is shown in Fig 9.10. The reference model of Picozzi et al. (2005) is retrieved but \n\nnot in the absolute scale. The model integrity is tested by comparing the reference model \n\ndispersion curve to the best fit model dispersion curve to get the proximity value, T=0.04 \n\nsuggests a very good retrieval of the model. Lontsi (2015) model has seven layers above the \n\nbedrock at 195 meters depth. The velocity increase trend is obtained by using the dispersion \n\ncurve obtained via forward modelling of this model (             . This velocity \n\nincrease trend and      values were used to estimate the thickness-frequency relationship for the \n\narea (      \n      \n\n . The thickness and velocity trend information were supplemented with \n\nellipticity of the model for inversion. The inversion result is shown in Fig. 9.11. The T value for \n\nthe best model is 0.13.  In this case, the model is not truly retrieved beyond the 80 meter depth, \n\nhowever, the overall velocity structure has a deviation of 18% of velocity below the 80 m \n\nbetween inverted and theoretical model. The surface wave methods are not sensitivity to map all \n\nthe small contrasting interfaces but sensitive to map only interfaces with high contrast. The \n\nLontsi (2015) model has interfaces whose velocities change very little bit among the first six \n\nlayers. As mentioned earlier, the technique adopted to perform microzonation are required to \n\nprovide the average shear wave velocity of soft sediment package and depth of bedrock. This \n\nvelocity and thickness information supplemented based ellipticity inversion achieve the goal of \n\nthat task very well. \n\nTable 9. 1 Shows the misfit and T values for the ellipticity different part inversions. \n\nPart used for inversion Minimum misfit  T-Value  \n\nEllipticity +Disperison curve  0.02 -------- \n\nComplete ell. + (velocity trend and thickness information) 0.03 0.008 \n\nLeft limb of ell. + ( velocity trend and thickness information) 0.03 0.15 \n\nLeft and right limb of ell. + (velocity trend and thickness \ninformation) \n\n0.009 0.007 \n\nright limb of ell. + ( velocity trend and thickness information) 0.008 0.007 \n\nAbove the trough of ell. + (velocity trend and thickness \ninformation) \n\n0.08 0.25 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n120 \n \n\n \n\nFig.9.6 Shows the inversion of a left limb of ellipticity curve along with S-velocity increase trend and thickness \n\ninformation. \n\n \n\nFig.9.7 Shows the inversion of a left-peak-right limb of ellipticity curve along with S-velocity increase trend and \n\nthickness information. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n121 \n \n\n \n\nFig.9.8 Shows the inversion of right limb of ellipticity curve along with S-velocity increase trend and thickness \n\ninformation. \n\n \n\nFig.9.9 Shows the inversion of beyond the trough of ellipticity curve along with S-velocity increase trend and \n\nthickness information. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n122 \n \n\n \n\nFig.9.10 Shows the inversion result of Picozzi model: (a) ellipticity curve along (b) shows the proximity value is \n\ngiven with narrow black line the dispersion curve of the original model; (c) shows the inversion results; the dotted \n\nline shows the velocity increase trend obtained from dispersion curve, dashed line shows Parolai (2002) velocity \n\ntrend for the area, and the narrow black line shows the original model. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig.9.11 Shows the inversion result of Greece model (Lontsi, 2015) from full ellipticity curve along with S-velocity \nincrease trend; dash line show the velocity increase trend for the model, at the center the proximity value is given \n\nwith narrow black line. \n\nThis analysis showed that the trade-off between velocity and thickness for the ellipticity \n\ninversion can be minimized by the incorporation of S-wave velocity increase trend and thickness \n\ninformation. If the S-wave wave velocity increase trend is used with the ellipticity, this can, in a \n\nbetter way, replicate the subsurfaces-wave velocity structure. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n123 \n \n\n \n\n9.6 Misfit function for the joint inversion \n\nGenerally, an inversion process can be divided into three steps: an computational algorithm to \n\ncompute the initial set of models, a mathematical procedure to estimate the theoretical target \n\ncurve (dispersion or ellipticity) utilizing a prior range of parameters (Vs,Vp, h, ) for layered  \n\nEarth model, and a computation procedure to minimize the misfit (this will be explained in \n\ncoming section). As in the all random inversion algorithm processes (i.e., genetic, simulated \n\nannealing and neighbourhood) the number of models generated are quite large. The test all of \n\nthese models ,that how close the response curves of these generated models are to the original \n\ntarget is done by a function known as misfit or cost function. The misfit is a quality control \n\nfactor which pedals the performance of the inversion. Its value measures the deviation between \n\nthe experimental and theoretically calculated values for the generated model for a layered Earth \n\nmodel. In case of uncertainty in the target curve data, the misfit function is defined for the \n\ndispersion curve inversion is given as \n\n \n\n              \n                                \n\n \n\n      \n \n            (9.2) \n\n \n\nwhere               is the experimental dispersion curve at frequency fi,             is the \n\nestimated dispersion curve for the model under consideration at frequency fi,       is the \n\nuncertainty in the experimental curve measurement at frequency  fi and N is the number of data \n\npoints for which this comparison between experimental and estimated curve is made. Similarly, \n\nthe misfit value for the ellipticity (H/V) inversion is given as \n\n            \n  \n\n                            \n \n\n      \n \n           (9.3) \n\n \n\nwhere              is the experimental ellipticity curve at frequency fi,               is the \n\nestimated (theoretical) ellipticity curve for the model under consideration at frequency fi,       is \n\nthe uncertainty in the experimental curve measurement at frequency  fi and N is the number of \n\npoints for which this comparison between experimental and estimated curve is made. Both the \n\nequations (9.2 and 9.3) will result 1 if all the models fall within the standard deviation of \n\nexperimental data (dispersion or ellipticity). This signify that the             and             \n\nusuall acceptable value is 1 (Sambridge, 2001), which mean that a calculated model ellipticity or \n\n\n\n \n \n\n124 \n \n\ndispersion curves must lie within the one standard deviation of experimental ellipticity and \n\ndispersion curves. An important point to remember here is that in case of no uncertainty in \n\nexperimental curve, specially when active source is used for the theoretical measurement such as \n\nperformed in this study, the term        in both equation 9.2 and 9.3 is replaced by \n\nthe        \n              \n\n \n    . In case of joint inversion, the misfit at the end of the inversion \n\nis average for both ellipticity and dispersion curves such as  \n\n \n\n                 \n                        \n\n \n       (9.4) \n\n \n\nHowever, this does not seem a very interesting approach, because it weights both the targets \n\nequally. Earlier, the joint inversion of H/V and dispersion curves was suggested around the peak \n\nand trough of the H/V curve due to the Love and body wave effects presence within the curve. \n\nFor peak and trough consideration case only, the misfit of H/V curve was suggested by \n\nScherbaum (2003) and Wathelet (2005) is given by \n\n \n\n                     \n                                  \n\n \n\n          \n      (9.5) \n\nwhile for minima such as \n\n                    \n                                    \n\n \n\n          \n      (9.6) \n\n \n\nwhere the                                      show the experimental ellipticity maximum \n\nand minimum values, while                                        show the modelled \n\nellipticity maximum and minimum values and                          show the \n\nuncertainty at these maximum and minimum experimental ellipticity curve. The final misfit for \n\nthese singularities points of ellipticity curve is average as \n\n \n\n                  \n                                        \n\n \n     (9.7) \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n125 \n \n\nHowever, a new problem arises here, which is how to weight this                   with the \n\ndispersion curve, which usually contains multiple data points. Two procedures are generally \n\nadopted for weighting each target in joint inversion. One is the averaging of the individuals \n\nmisfit for both the dispersion and ellipticity (Hobiger, 2013), while the other is suggested by \n\nWathelet (2005) is given as \n\n \n\n                                                   (9.8) \n\n \n\nIn this case, the usual values of the   is 0.5, which means to assign an equal weight to both of the \n\ndispersion targets. Similarly,     means the inversion is completely based on the dispersion \n\ncurve, while     means the inversion relies only on ellipticity curve. However, as the numbers \n\nof data sample for both the target are not usually the same, it is difficult to assign an equal weight \n\nto of both the targets. Piccozi et al. (2005) suggested a procedure to lower the values of   for one \n\ntarget at the expense of the other (reducing one target weight while increasing the other). By \n\napplying this trial and error method, we can choose the value for   which results in a lower \n\nmisfit. We checked this procedure here for different values of   and found generally a good \n\nresult of    ranges from 0.2 to 0.015. However, the disadvantage of this procedure is that the \n\nrange of   changes for case to case and has no such common range of    values which could be \n\nrecommended for the general usage.  \n\nSo, defining the misfit function seems very cumbersome. Usually, the Sambridge (2001) idea of \n\nan acceptance level for misfit is used to overcome this hindrance in the weighting of a different \n\ntarget. Sambridge (2001) suggested an acceptance level of misfit, which is, within certain misfit \n\nvalue, all the models in parameter space are taken from the model generated for the different \n\ntarget (dispersion and ellipticity curves). As acceptance level, Sambridge (2001) suggested that \n\nall the generated models should lie within one standard deviation of the target curve, \n\n                                              (fi)=1. For joint inversion of different targets \n\n(dispersion and ellipticity curves) the misfit weight is set to 1 for both the targets at the start of \n\ninversion, which will compel the algorithm to generate models within one standard deviation. \n\nThe misfit values at the end are averaged out for both of the targets. The drawback of this \n\napproach arises simply from the question: are the standard deviations for both targets the same? \n\nThe simple answer is no, because both the targets are obtained differently as the H/V curve is \n\nobtained from the ambient noise recording (will certainly have higher standard deviation), while \n\nthe dispersion curve is obtained from active source, and will have little standard deviation \n\n(specially in our case).  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n126 \n \n\nTherefore, it is dearly required to define a weighting function for this joint misfit function. This \n\nnew weighting function should use the span of data points for the different targets (dispersion \n\nand ellipticity curves) as a controlling parameter. We tried to obtain this weighting function from \n\na simple proportion formula such as              ,  where n is the number of data points \n\nfor ellipticity curve, m is the number of data points for dispersion curve,           are weighting \n\nfunctions of ellipticity and dispersion curves, respectively. The values of these weights are \n\nchosen such that their sum should be equal to 1 (            . This lead to define the \n\nweighting factor for both the targets as       \n \n\n   \n and        \n\n \n\n   \n .  Now, the joint misfit \n\nfunction for both the targets can be defined with their respective weighting functions as \n\n  \n\n               \n                                \n\n \n\n           \n\n \n             \n\n                              \n \n\n           \n\n \n   (9.9) \n\n \n\nwhere               and                are the target curves for both targets (theoretical or \n\nexperimental),                 and                are the modelled curves for both the targets \n\nat frequency f,             is the deviation in data measurement. If not available, it can be \n\nreplaced with                and               in either case.  \n\nWe used the IAG model to demonstrate how this misfit function work for joint inversion of \n\nellipticity and dispersion curves considering a different number of data points for both the targets \n\nand the result was compared in terms of target curves and the original model. Initially, the data \n\npoints of both the targets were considered to be equal, n=m=50, followed by n=25 and m=50 \n\n(Fig 9.12). This weighting function for both the targets           has an advantage which \n\nensures higher weights for the target curve having less number of data sample, while the target \n\nhaving higher number of points get lower weight. This can be observed more clearly when the \n\ndata points for ellipticity are reduced. The weight it gets higher as compared to dispersion curve \n\n(Fig 9.13).  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n127 \n \n\n \n\nFig.9.12 Shows the inversion results for misfit function defined in Eq.9.9 for a different number of data points for \n\nellipticity and dispersion curves.

However, this new misfit does not give a satisfactory result for \n\nthe experimental data inversion.

The three different sites chosen for this are located at the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, \n\nBrazil (Fig 10.1). The three sites, University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), the Col\u00f4nia and the Bebedouro \n\nwere chosen while keeping in mind some distinct properties of each site. The USP site (in front \n\nof the IAG - Instituto de Astronomia, Geof\u00edsica e Ci\u00eancias Atmosf\u00e9ricas, cited here frequently as \n\nIAG and another site next to the IGc - Instituto de Geoci\u00eancias, cited here as IGC) has the \n\nadvantage of the borehole data availability for the calibration and for the quality check of the \n\ninversion result. The Col\u00f4nia site was chosen because of its geological significance, such as its \n\nbowl shape structure that is almost swampy and most of the conventional geophysical methods \n\nare difficult to be employed there because of the surface water and mud (there are some small \n\npatches of dry land which make it possible to install seismometer for noise recording and hence, \n\nthe H/V analysis). The Bebedouro site was chosen because of the availability of seismic noise \n\ndata recording as well as the multiple water wells subsurface interfaces data, from which the \n\ninformation about the subsurface interfaces were accessible and it was easy to test the thickness-\n\nfrequency relation. Among all these three sites, the two IAG-IGC and Col\u00f4nia have a strong \n\nbedrock laying below the unconsolidated soft sediments. This is true for the Bebedouro area too, \n\nhowever, the surface sediments are stronger as compared to the pre-mentioned sites. The detailed \n\ngeological description of these sites are beyond the scope of this chapter, however, a concise \n\nintroduction will be presented for each of the sites here. In this chapter, initially, the geology of \n\nthe sites will be briefly discussed, followed by the removal of Love waves contribution from the \n\nH/V curve, to make it a truer representative of the Rayleigh waves ellipticity, and then the use of \n\nits inversion with dispersion curve. At the end, it will be showed some new aspects for which the \n\nsimple H/V could be utilized. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n130 \n \n\n \n\nFig.10.1 Shows the boundary (in red) of Sao Paulo state. Locations where the MASW and H/V analysis were made \n\nare shown in the red circles ((taken from Google earth. Imagery date April 2015. Access at March 2017). \n\nThe IAG-IGC-USP site is located in the continental rift part of south-eastern Brazilian basins, \n\nspecifically in the S\u00e3o Paulo basin. The S\u00e3o Paulo basin has an irregular shape comprised of an \n\narea of almost 1000 sq. km. It is mainly drained by the Tiet\u00ea river and secondarily by Pinheiros \n\nand Tamanduatei rivers plus their tributaries (Riccomini, 1989, 1992). The S\u00e3o Paulo basin is \n\ngeotechnical and geologically extensively investigated because most of it lies under the \n\nurbanized part of S\u00e3o Paulo city. The geology of the site presents predominance of clay-sand \n\nsediments of Resende and S\u00e3o Paulo formations, superimposed on the crystalline basement \n\naugen-gneisses composed of Precambrian age (Ricomini, 1989). The lithological information \n\nfrom the wells (Porsani et al., 2003) shows a sandy-clay backfill layer predominantly dark, \n\nsometimes with organic matter, with a variable thickness between 4.5 and 6 m. Sedimentary \n\nunits of the Resende formation have two levels. The top consists of interbedded silty clay with \n\ncoarse-grained sand that has thickness ranging from 11 to 14.5 m. The lower unit is composed of \n\nsandy-clay superimposed to a clay horizon, with thickness between 29 and 32 m, the sandy layer \n\nis 18 m thick and the clay layer 13 m thick at the end. The crystalline basement is composed of \n\naugen-gneiss with feldspar crystals. The top of the basement is fractured. The bedrock is at 52-55 \n\nm depth in the site. \n\nThe Col\u00f4nia site is located in the southern suburbs of S\u00e3o Paulo city, Brazil (Fig.10.2). In the \n\narea, there is a structure with a circular geometry (diameter of 3,6 km) comprising an annular \n\nring of hills surrounding a depression. The structure is mostly a swamp. Its origin is attributed to \n\nan impact of meteorite (Riccomini et al., 1989). The structure was formed in crystalline \n\nbasement rocks of Neoproterozoic age and the depression is mainly filled with organic-rich \n\n\n\n \n \n\n131 \n \n\nsediments of Quaternary age. The main rock types of the basement comprise schist, quartzite, \n\ngneiss, migmatite, diorite, quartz diorite (Sadowski et al., 1974). The upper sediments of the \n\nsedimentary infill of the depression described from a shallow drilling (Ledru et al., 2005, 2009) \n\nshowed black, organic-rich, clayey sediment (peat) with some intercalations of fine sand. A core \n\nrecovery of a groundwater borehole (Riccomini et al., 1991) showed the follows sedimentary \n\ncolumn: i) predominantly organic-rich silty clay up to 200 m deep, approximately, with minor \n\nintercalations of sandy mud with quartz grains after 90 m deep; ii) from 200 m up to 260 m \n\noccurs intercalations of sandy mud with quartz grains and sandy mud with quartz pebbles; iii) \n\nstarting from 260 m, approximately, occurs pebbly mud with some presence of Precambrian rock \n\nfragments suggesting to be a fanglomerate deposit derived from the elevated parts of the ring \n\n(Ledru et al., 2005), a representation of the initial filing, or to occurrence of a crater-fill breccia. \n\nThe total depth, estimated by seismic reflection investigation (shown in Fig 10.2) which does not \n\nreach the central part of the structure (Riccomini et al., 2011) is around 340 m (sedimentary infill \n\nplus breccia). \n\n \n\n \n\nFig.10.2 Location (left) and geological map of the Colonia structure. The black thick lines indicate the locations of \n\nMASW tests, while thin line indicates reflection line (modified from Riccomini et al., 2011). \n\nThe Bebedouro site is covered by a layer of sandstone (Adamantina formation) with, usually, 50 \n\nto 100 m thick. Below the sandstone is a basalt layer (Serra Geral formation) with a thickness of \n\napproximately 500m (Assumpcao, 2007). The geological map of the site is shown in Fig. 10.3, \n\nwhich shows the main geological units of the region. The sandstones overlie, in unconformity, \n\nthe basalts of the Serra Geral Formation (Lower Cretaceous). In between, basalt sequence may \n\n\n\n \n \n\n132 \n \n\nalso occur with thin layers of sandstones. The surface of the terrain is smooth, in general, with \n\nelevation varying from 480 to 520 meters. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig.10.3 Shows the geological map of the NE region of S\u00e3o Paulo State. The area is dominated geologically by the \n\nsedimentary rocks of the Bauru Group and basalts. \n\nIn Bebedouro, sansdtones predominate Adamantina Formation and the underlied basalts of the \n\nSerra Geral Formation; these basalt layers extends westward under sediments (sandstones) of the \n\nBauru Group. In Bebedouro and neighboring municipalities, fractured aquifers in this basalt \n\nlayer are quite explored (Assump\u00e7\u00e3o, 2007). \n\n10.2 Data acquisition parameters \n\nMASW and the H/V analysis were made at two sites in USP campus (S\u00e3o Paulo city) (Fig  10.4). \n\nOne of the acquisitions was made in front of Instituto de Astronomia, Geof\u00edsica e Ci\u00eancias \n\nAtmosf\u00e9ricas (IAG) while the other in front of Instituto de Geoci\u00eancias (IGC). The \n\nmeasurements were made with a broadband 3 component sensor (Nanometrics Trillium Compact \n\n120-s) and the ambient noise wavefield recordings were made for 24 continuous hours on \n\nweekends to ensure minimum cultural noise influence. The ambient noise data acquisitions were \n\ndone following the guidelines developed under the SESAME (2004) recommendations. For the \n\nfundamental resonance frequency estimation through H/V curve, the SESAMES\u2019s (2004) \n\nprocessing recommendations were followed. Three sensors were used to record the seismic noise \n\ndata at IAG site while two sensors were used at IGC site. IAG site contains three boreholes.  The \n\nnoise measurements were made next to each borehole (Fig 10.5). The H/V curves of IAG and \n\nIGC site are given in Fig 10.6. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n133 \n \n\n \n\nFig.10.4 Shows the locations of IAG-IGC-USP site where the MASW (in red) and H/V analysis were made \n\n(triangle) (taken from Google earth. Imagery date April 2015. Access at March 2017).. \n\n \n\n \n \nFig.10.5 Shows the detailed location map of IAG site; legends explain the different symbols (modified from Porsani \n\n2004). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n134 \n \n\n \nFig.10.6 Shows the H/V curve of IAG and IGC sites. \n\n \n\nAt the Col\u00f4nia site, seismic noise recording was made at six sites (Fig 10.7) with the same \n\nsensors. The seismic noise recordings were made at different locations and similar processing \n\nwas followed to find the H/V curve for each site. The two MASW profiles were recorded near to \n\nsensor 7 and 4 (Fig 10.7). The recording parameters of these and all the others MASWs are given \n\nin chapter 4. The H/V curves obtained for these sites are shown in Fig 10.8.  \n\nThe Bebedouro site has been monitored through seismometers installed for source \n\ncharacterization of induced seismic activity in the area. The locations of these stations and water \n\nwells are shown in Fig 8.5 (chapter 8). The H/V curves obtained from seismic noise recording \n\nnext to 6 MASW profile are shown in Fig 10.9.  \n\nThe H/V curves obtained at these three sites could be considered a good approximate of the \n\nfundamental resonance frequency of these three sites. However, to invert these curves for the \n\nshear wave velocity, the contribution of the other seismic phases should be removed, as \n\nsuggested by Bonnefoy et al. (2008). To make this analysis we will demonstrate this Love \n\nwaves effect removal for seismic noise recorded at IAG site only, it is due to the borehole \n\nvelocity (Vs) availability for calibration via forward modelling.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n135 \n \n\n \nFig.10.7 Shows the elevation contour map of the Colonia area; the red triangle shows the location of seismic noise \n\nrecordings. \n\n \n\n \nFig.10.8 Shows the H/V curves obtained for the Colonia site (Fig 10.7). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n136 \n \n\n \nFig.10. 9 Shows the H/V curves of Bebedouro area next to each MASW profile. \n\n \n\n10.3 The retrieval of ellipticity from single 3c-station recording \n\n \n\nThe H/V curve peak frequency alone can provide three distinct informations, fundamental site \n\nresonance frequency, the thickness of the soil package and the average shear wave velocity of the \n\nsoil package above the seismic bedrock. These information's can be directly obtained from the \n\nH/V curve peak. To obtained the thickness and average shear wave velocity information of the \n\nsoil package, the knowledge of    and the velocity increase trend with depth (x) are needed. For \n\nexample, the IAG site fundamental frequency obtained from the H/V peak is 2.1 Hz. The values \n\nof           and x=0.42 were obtained from the dispersion curve direct inversion. These \n\nvalues were used to obtained the thickness of the soil package at the site (54 m) and the average \n\nshear wave velocity of the soil package (455 m/s). The depth of bedrock found from the borehole \n\ndata is 53-55 m, while the average shear wave velocity of the soil above bedrock is around 393 \n\nm/s (only 15% deviation from the Vs values obtained from the H/V curve peak). This procedure \n\nshows the direct utilization of the H/V curve. However, for more sophisticated inversion and \n\nbetter subsurface information retrieval, we, usually, employ an inversion procedure. In this \n\nprocedure, the H/V curve is linked to some physical phenomenon, which is latter utilized for the \n\ninversion. For example, the H/V curve is closely linked with the Rayleigh waves ellipticity and \n\nthese Rayleigh waves ellipticity characteristics are used to obtain the subsurface information.  \n\nMost of the studies performed on the joint inversion of the H/V and dispersion curves were based \n\non the assumption that H/V the curve truly replicates the ellipticity of Rayleigh waves. However, \n\nsome earlier studies showed that the surface waves contribution to the horizontal components \n\ndominates over all the other phases of seismic waves, which constitute noise wavefield \n\n(Yamamoto, 2000; and Arai &amp; Tokimatsu, 2000). Similarly, another observation established \n\n\n\n \n \n\n137 \n \n\nfrom these studies is that Love waves contribution to the horizontal component may be higher \n\nthan that of the Rayleigh waves. The same conclusion was endorsed by Bonnefoy-Claudet \n\n(2008). This fraction of Love waves contribution to the horizontal component is not constant and \n\nvaries with time and from site to site (Kohler et al., 2006; Endrun, 2011) (also outlined in chapter \n\n2). Hence, a prior assumption (if not close to the real value) about the Love waves fraction at the \n\nhorizontal component of the H/V curve might lead to erroneous results. So, it is of prime interest \n\nto remove the Love waves contribution from the H/V curve to make it closer to the true Rayleigh \n\nwaves ellipticity and then proceed to the inversion.  \n\nAs described earlier, the H/V inversion was based on the conjecture that H/V completely \n\ncorresponds to the Rayleigh waves ellipticity. The experimental H/V curve is usually unable to \n\nreproduce all the ellipticity curve characteristics (Tokimatsu, 1997). Tokimatsu (1997) observed \n\nthat, except at the peak of the H/V and ellipticity curves, the H/V curve amplitude is generally \n\nhigher than that of Rayleigh waves ellipticity (Fig 10.10). This deviation between the curves can \n\nbe easily linked to the presence of the Love and other body waves phases to the noise wavefield \n\nat the horizontal component. The ellipticity peak ratio is amplifying more as compared to the \n\nH/V curve. Tazime (1957) and Scherbaum (2003) tried to link this Rayleigh ellipticity higher \n\namplitude to the vanishing of the vertical component, around the site, fundamental frequency. \n\nSuch as the fundamental resonance frequency, the medium acts as a filter which attenuates all \n\nvertical component contributions from the seismic noise wavefield. However, the H/V curve \n\namplitude never reaches to match the ellipticity curve around this peak, but always remains \n\nfinite. To explain this, one might link the non-vanishing of the vertical component around the \n\nsite fundamental period to the presence of other seismic phases like refracted, reflected and \n\nconverted body waves. The lowering of vertical component spectral amplitude around the \n\nresonance frequency can be easily observed. However, like the ellipticity curve, the vertical \n\ncomponent spectra does not vanish; this makes sense if we assume that the body waves \n\ncontribution to the vertical component. The Fig 10.10 shows the theoretical Rayleigh ellipticity \n\nobtained for the borehole P2 (Fig 10.5) and the H/V curve obtained from the noise measurement \n\nat the same site. The trough of both curves (ellipticity and H/V) does not perfectly match. This \n\nmight be due to the argument that the borehole model is a representative single point while the \n\nH/V curve shape and peak is affected by the whole site local structure. Generally, the ellipticity \n\ncurve is not considered for the inversion beyond the trough frequency due to the fact that from \n\nthe trough onwards the influence of higher modes might dominate the curve (Hobiger et al., \n\n2013). \n\n \n\nThe removal of the Love waves effect can be done by characterizing the distinctive properties of \n\nRayleigh waves, which are different from the Love waves. This distinct feature can be later used \n\nfor Love waves effect removal. Surface waves resulted from the polarized body waves coupled \n\nnear to or at the surface, for instance, the coupling of P-wave and the vertically polarized shear \n\nwave (  ) produces Rayleigh waves (Aki 2002). A phase shift of ?     exists between the \n\n\n\n \n \n\n138 \n \n\nparticle motion induced by this P-waves and vertically polarized shear wave (  ). This coupling \n\ndepicts an ellipse at the surface. The phase shift can either be positive or negative producing \n\nprograde or retrograde motion. Hence, the Rayleigh wave ellipticity can be defined as the ratio of \n\nhorizontal and vertical displacement eigen-function at each frequency (at the surface) of the \n\nparticle motion under Rayleigh waves influence. Love waves are horizontally polarized shear \n\nwaves (  ) trapped within the soft layer above a rock of high shear wave velocity due to multiple \n\nreflections. This distinction can be utilized to minimize or even remove the effect of Love waves \n\nfraction from the horizontal components of the experimental H/V curve and make it closer to the \n\nellipticity curve (Hobiger et al., 2009). \n\n \n\nAs discussed, the presence of both surface wave types fraction has to be considered for inversion \n\nalgorithms. The first technique proposed for this analysis is the classical polarization, where the \n\nH/V ratio obtained from the noise analysis is used for the Love waves effect minimization. The \n\nmain assumptions on which this technique is based on are that, around the peak frequency of the \n\nH/V curve, the vertical component is mainly dominated by Rayleigh waves fundamental mode \n\nand the spectral content of the Love waves contributes equally to the horizontal components of \n\nthe H/V curve. Hence, the H/V ratio amplitude should be divided by the    to remove the effect \n\nof Love waves (Fig 10.10). However, the Rayleigh/Love contribution, within the noise wavefield \n\nvaries from site to site and its fraction, also strongly depends on frequency (Cornou, 2002). \n\nHence, this equal contribution approach for Love waves effect removal from the horizontal \n\ncomponent might lead to biased results. Therefore, to remove the Love waves effect, it should be \n\nused some more sophisticated approaches rather than a prior assumption about the Love waves \n\nfraction. Two procedures are suggested for this task of single 3c-station recording case: the time-\n\nfrequency analysis (Fah et al., 2009) and RayDec (Hobiger et al., 2009). We adopted both \n\ntechniques in this thesis, to remove the Love waves contribution from the horizontal components \n\nof single station noise recording. A concise introduction of this technique is presented here. The \n\ninterested readers are referred to Fah et al. (2009) and Hobiger (2009) for more details. \n\n \n\n \nFig.10.10 The comparison between H/V curve and the theoretical borehole ellipticity curve for the same site.

The first technique employed for this job is the time-\n\nfrequency analysis. In this procedure, the Rayleigh waves vertical component is used as a \n\ndistinctive property indicator of Rayleigh waves, which is lacking in the Love waves case. The \n\nvertical component energy level is estimated from the continuous wavelet transformation, which \n\nis later correlated with combined horizontal components energy maxima for the Rayleigh waves. \n\nThe continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) is performed for all the three components of \n\nnoise recording. This transformation projects the real-valued signal x(t) into a time-scale plane, \n\nwhere both the duration and bandwidth of the noise signal are controlled by this single parameter \n\ncalled scale. CWT can be defined as  \n\n             \n \n\n  \n        \n\n   \n\n \n   \n\n \n\n  \n       (10.1) \n\nwhere x(t) represents the noise record (vertical or horizontal),  (t) is the mother wavelet, * \n\nillustrates a complex conjugation process,   is the scale parameter, and if t is the time then b is a \n\ntranslation in time. The wavelet generally chosen for CWT transformation is Morelet wavelet.  \n\nThe original Morelet wavelet was modified for the H/V analysis by Fah et al. (2009) as the \n\noriginal wavelet was not suitable for this analysis. This new modified Morelet wavelet is \n\nnarrower in the frequency domain, which is better for the noise time-frequency analysis as \n\nfrequency resolution is more substantial in this analysis (Fah et al., 2009). The modified Morelet \n\nwavelet is defined as \n\n     \n \n\n  \n          \n\n    for           (10.2) \n\nHere, m serves as a single parameter that controls both time and frequency resolutions. The \n\ncentral frequency of the wavelet is     at scale a=1. Higher values for m means higher frequency \n\nresolution while low time control/resolution. Similarly, low value for m ensures more time \n\nresolution at the expense of frequency resolution. The value of m=1/2 corresponds to the \n\nclassical Morelet wavelet.  \n\nWhen the CWT is performed on the signal, its amplitude is obtained as a function of both time \n\nand frequency. The energetic arrival at the vertical component is chosen and the corresponding \n\nmaxima on the horizontal components for the Rayleigh waves arrival is picked for the same time \n\nand frequency (Fig 10.11). The horizontal component selected response is delayed and advances \n\nat quarter of the period to compensate the theoretical phase shift ?\n \n\n \n between the vertical and \n\nhorizontal components. The ratio between these vertical and horizontal responses is taken as the \n\nratio for this specific time and frequency and is stored. The process is repeated for all the \n\nfrequency and time translations, and the wavelet coefficients are statistically analyzed through \n\n\n\n \n \n\n140 \n \n\nhistogram. The detailed time-frequency procedure analysis can be found in Fah et al. (2009). \n\nHere, we checked the effect of two parameters, duration of the signal and m of the time-\n\nfrequency results with the borehole ellipticity.  \n\n \n\nFig 10.11 A graphic outline of the time-frequency method showing the CWT results of the vertical (top) and \n\ncombined horizontal (bottom) signals from noise record. The plus sign is taken as an example of maxima on the \n\nvertical component for Rayleigh wave detections. The ellipticity of these detected Rayleigh waves is estimated using \n\nthe ratio between the horizontal and vertical maxima at this time and frequency, ? shifting the horizontal component \n\nby a quarter period at each analyzed frequency f. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n141 \n \n\n \nFig.10.12 Shows  the  ellipticity (H/V) obtained from continuous wavelet transformation CWT for different duration \n\nof the signal with value of m=2; a histogram is drawn for each frequency; the colour within the histogram indicates \n\nthe energy level; curly line shows the ellipticity obtained from CWT while solid smooth line shows the ellipticity \n\ncurve obtained from the borehole data at the same location (IAG site). \n\n \n\n \nFig.10.13 Shows the ellipticity (H/V) obtained from the continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) for different \n\nvalues of m for one hour signal. The curly line shows ellipticity obtained from CWT while solid smooth line shows \n\nthe ellipticity curve obtained from the borehole data at the same location (IAG site). \n\n \n\nFrom a comparison of the result with the borehole ellipticity at the site, we can suggest that for a \n\nbetter correlation with the right limb of the borehole ellipticity curve (Fig.10.13 c-d) ,the value of \n\nm (scale) should be in the range of 8-16. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n142 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n10.3.2 Random decrement technique (RayDec) \n\n \n\nThe other major technique used for the Love waves effect removal/minimization to make the \n\nH/V curve a truer representative of the Rayleigh ellipticity is RayDec (random decrement \n\ntechnique). RayDec is classically used to find the building dynamic properties using a single \n\ncomponent signal. Hobiger et al. (2009) extended this technique to the three component signal \n\nanalysis. The ellipticity retrieved from the single station noise recording through RayDec is \n\nnearer to ellipticity curve than the classical H/V division by     for the Love waves effect \n\nminimization. A brief outline of the method will be discussed here (for more detail procedure, \n\nsee Hobiger et al., 2009). \n\nConsider a three component signal having N data point for each component, each of length T; \n\nthe signal is, at first, filtered of bandwidth df centred at frequency f. The vertical component is \n\nconsidered as a master trigger similar to time-frequency analysis for the distinction of Rayleigh \n\nwave arrival. The vertical component of noise record is a search for all the times where the signal \n\nchanges its sign from negative to positive; at each of these points, a signal of length segment   is \n\nstored for all the three components. The length of this segment   is chosen to ensure 20 \n\nsignificant cycles at each analyzed frequency ( =20/f, where f is the analyzed frequency; \n\nfrequency range 0.2 to 20 Hz is used).  \n\nBoth horizontal components are shifted by      to compensate the theoretical phase shift of \n \n\n \n?between vertical and horizontal components. The ratio between these stored segmented signals \n\nis found as  \n\n   \n            \n \n\n \n \n\n    \n \n\n \n        \n\n           (10.3) \n\nThe term hf.s (t) shows the average horizontal signal while Vf.s(t) shows the vertical component. \n\nFor our recorded data, we analyzed a one-hour noise record similar to the one used for the \n\nprevious analysis in the section above. There are two control parameters on which this analysis \n\nof RayDec depends, one is the choice of window length ( ) and the other is the bandwidth (df) \n\nof filtering. The effects of these parameters along with the duration of the signal are shown in Fig \n\n10.14.  The one-hour record is divided into 6 windows of 10 minutes each. Each one of these \n\nwindows is analyzed separately and the ellipticity is discovered. At the end, the ellipticity for all \n\nthese 6 windows is averaged out (Fig 10.14d). The ellipticity obtained is shown in Fig 10.14d \n\nalong with the averaging error bar. The result shows a better match with the borehole\u2019s ellipticity \n\nespecially around the peak and some part of the ellipticity left and right limb. The choice of \n\nwindow length ( ) and bandwidth (df) for which we found better result are   \n  \n\n \n     df=0.4f. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n143 \n \n\n \n\n \nFig.10.14 Shows the  ellipticity obtained via RayDec technique; (a) shows the effect of recorded signal duration on \n\nellipticity retrieval df=0.2 and delta=20/f; (b) shows the effect of delta on ellipticity retrieval for T=1 hour and  for \n\ndf=0.2; (c) shows the effect of filtering for different df values with T=1 hour and  delta=20/f;  (d) shows the  \n\nellipticity for six 10 minutes windows, the result is averaged out and compared with the borehole ellipticity. \n\n \n\n10.4 Joint inversion of the ellipticity and dispersion curve for USP, Colonia and Bebedouro \n\nThe ultimate goal of most of the near surface geotechnical and earthquake engineering is to \n\nevaluate the stiffness of an area. The stiffness direct relation with shear-wave velocity makes it \n\npossible to measure Vs-profile with some geophysical techniques from the surface recording. \n\nThe retrieval of ellipticity from the seismic ambient noise for a single station recording by \n\nremoving/minimizing the effect of Love waves made it possible to obtain the Vs- profile with \n\nlittle bit more accuracy than the all previous inversion of H/V and dispersion curves. To check \n\nthis, we needed to jointly invert the dispersion and ellipticity curves for all the three sites, \n\nstarting from the IAG site as it has borehole data available for quality check of the inversion \n\nresult. The ellipticity of all three studied area were obtained through the RayDec technique. As \n\nshown, in both the case of time-frequency analysis and RayDec techniques, that the ellipticity is \n\n\n\n \n \n\n144 \n \n\nwell retrieved for the right limb of the borehole ellipticity (Fig 10.13d and 10.14d), the same \n\nobservation is made by Hobiger et al. (2013) for the right limb. As the peak amplitude of the \n\nretrieved ellipticity does not match the theoretical ellipticity peak of the site, the data points \n\naround the peak are not considered in the three cases. However, as the peak frequency provides a \n\nbetter estimate of the proximal depth of the bedrock, some part of the left limb of the ellipticity is \n\nconsidered for inversion to confine and utilize this peak frequency. The experimental dispersion \n\ncurve of the IAG site, along with the theoretical dispersion curve from the Vs profile of the \n\nborehole P2, is shown in Fig 10.15. The experimental dispersion curve was obtained from 4.6 Hz \n\ntill 33 Hz, while the borehole model dispersion curve was obtained for the frequency range 0.2 \n\nHz to 50 Hz. However, it deviates from the experimental curve around 7 to 17 Hz. This deviation \n\nmight be due to the fact that the borehole model dispersion curve represents a single point while \n\nthe experimental dispersion is affected by the Vs structure of the whole area. The joint inversion \n\nof both the targets curve is shown in Fig.10.16.  \n\n \n \n\nFig.10.15 Shows the dispersion image of MASW recording line (Fig10.5). The dotted line shows the dispersion \n\ncurve obtained from dispersion image while the dashed line shows the borehole\u2019s model dispersion curve. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n145 \n \n\n \nFig.10.16  The inversion result of ellipticity and dispersion curves at IAG site; (a) shows the fitting ellipticity curve \n\nof IAG site with the dotted line while the black line shows the lower misfit ellipticity curve model; (b) shows the \n\nfitting to the experimental curve with the dotted line and lower misfit model dispersion curve with the black line; (c) \n\nshows all the generated models, the black line shows the lower misfit model. \n\nThe inversions of different parts of ellipticity and velocity increase trend provide a better \n\nestimate of the bedrock velocity in the theoretical section (chapter 9), however, in the \n\nexperimental ellipticity and dispersion curve inversion, despite of the better depth estimate of the \n\nbedrock, it failed to provide a good estimate of bedrock velocity (Fig 10.17). The reason for this \n\nmight be the unavailability of the experimental dispersion curve for the lower frequency range to \n\nbetter constrained the bedrock velocity. \n\n \n \n\nFig.10.17 Shows the lower misfit Vs model (solid line) of the joint inversion (Fig.10.16) and borehole Vs model \n\n(dashed line). \n\n \n\nWe compared our recent results to the previous investigation at the site (Porsani et al., 2004). For \n\nall the models with misfit lower than 0.5, the bedrock depth retrieved from the joint inversion are \n\n\n\n \n \n\n146 \n \n\naround 44-55 m, which is in very good correspondence with borehole (P2) depth 55 m. \n\nAdditionally, lower misfit model shows bedrock at 53 m (Fig 10.17). The lower misfit model of \n\njoint inversion when compared to the borehole model (Fig 10.17) shows a maximum of 17% \n\ndeviation in the velocity from the borehole model within the soil package. The bedrock velocity \n\nis not well constrained and has a 41% deviation with the borehole model velocity (Fig 10.17). \n\nProbably, the ellipticity curve joint inversion with a higher mode dispersion curve might provide \n\na better constraint to the bedrock velocity as shown by Piccozi et al. (2005). However, it is not \n\nvery common to observe higher mode dispersion curve and, even if one is able to retrieve the \n\nhigher mode dispersion curve, the order of the picked curve remained always a mystery as higher \n\nmode appearance generally does not follow a certain order. As we do not have a clear higher \n\nmode dispersion appearance in our experimental curve (Fig 10.15), we limited to the \n\nfundamental mode dispersion curve only. The joint inversion performed here showed good \n\naverage velocity trend retrieval with that of borehole shear-wave velocity. This velocity \n\ndeviation within soil package between the borehole and joint inversion results might be due to \n\nthe fact that the borehole result is confined to a single point, while the ellipticity and dispersion \n\ncurve results are influenced by the whole local subsurface structure. The short summary of this \n\nsite results shows that if we are able to minimize the Love waves contribution to the horizontal \n\nnoise wavefield, the joint inversion will give good results in a very cost effective and easy way. \n\nThe joint inversion of IGC ellipticity and dispersion curves are shown in the Fig 10.18. The \n\nbedrock depth for the lower misfit model in IGC case is a bit shallower (46 m). This shallower \n\nbedrock depth could also be inferred directly from the peak frequency of the H/V which is 2.5 \n\nHz as compared to 2.1 Hz at IAG case. \n\n \n\n \nFig.10.18 Shows the inversion result of the ellipticity and dispersion curves at IGC site; (a) shows the fitting \n\nellipticity curve of  IGC site with the dotted line while the black line shows the lower misfit model ellipticity curve; \n\n(b) shows the fitting to the experimental curve with the dotted line and lower misfit model dispersion curve with the \n\nblack line; (c) shows all the generated models, the black line shows the lower misfit model. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n147 \n \n\nThe Col\u00f4nia experimental data recording had some limitation, especially in the dispersion \n\ncurves, where it was very difficult to retrieve it for a broad range of frequencies. This \n\ndisappearance of dispersion in Col\u00f4nia could be linked to the presence of muddy clay with very \n\nlower cohesion. However, the dispersion curve was still obtained for a small frequency range \n\n(1.1 to 3.8 Hz). We have assumed this dispersion information to be the representative of shear-\n\nwave velocity increase within the soil package and have inverted this information directly to Vs \n\nand depth values. These Vs and depth estimates were used to obtain velocity increase trend with \n\ndepth (Fig 10.19). The velocity increase trend along with the velocity (Vs) at one-meter depth \n\nwas input into Eq 8.12 and the depth of the bedrock at each sensor locations were estimated \n\n(Table 10.1). This sediment package thickness and velocity increase trend were used along with \n\nellipticity curve for inversion and shear wave velocity profile retrieval (Fig 10.20). \n\n \n\nFig.10.19 Shows the velocity increase trend via best-fit through shear wave velocity and depth which give value of \n\n          and x=0.45 (b here is x in other relation of chapter 7). \n\nTable 10. 1 Shows the fundamental frequency of each station and their corresponding thickness estimated from \n\n(8.12). \n\n \n\nStation name \n\nFundamental \n\nresonance \n\nfrequency    \n(Hz) \n\n \n \n\n  \n    \n\n \n  \n\n      \n\n  \n \n\n \n\n \n      \n\n \n\n \n\n           h (m) \n\nCLN1 0.50 3.52 47.3 166 \n\nCLN2 0.52 3.28 47.3 155 \n\nCLN3 1.9 0.31 47.3 15 \n\nCLN4,5 0.31 8.40 47.3 397 \n\nCLN6 0.31 8.40 47.3 397 \n\nCLN7 0.38 5.8 47.3 274 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n148 \n \n\n \n\nFig.10.20 Shows the inversion of ellipticity curve supplemented by the sediment thickness and velocity increase \n\ntrend shown in dashed line. \n\nIn Bebedouro area, ellipticity curves were obtained from each of the 6 sensors installed next to \n\nMASW profiles. The joint inversions were made for all these six locations. The results are \n\nshown in Fig 10.21- 10.23. The velocity increase trend was obtained from all the six dispersion \n\ncurve direct inversions. This velocity increase trend was used along with ellipticity curve \n\nobtained for the 4 sensors where the dispersion curves were not available (Fig 10.24). The \n\nvelocity increase trend was overlaid on the inversion result which shows a very good velocity \n\nincrease trend match with lower misfit velocity profile (Fig 10.24). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n149 \n \n\n \n\nFig.10.21 Shows the inversion results of the dispersion and ellipticity curves for Bebedouro site, areas Beb1 and Beb \n\n4a. \n\n \n\nFig.10.22 Shows the inversion results of the dispersion and ellipticity curves for Bebedouro site, areas Beb7 and Beb \n\n11. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n150 \n \n\n \n\nFig.10.23 Shows the inversion results of the dispersion and ellipticity curves for Bebedouro site, areas Beb 4b and \n\nBeb 16. \n\n \n\nFig.10.24 Shows the inversion results of ellipticity curves supplemented with velocity trend (shown in dashed line of \n\nall models) for Bebedouro site, areas Beb 13, Beb 17, Beb 17 and Beb 19. \n\n10.5 The application of H/V curve for some new aspects \n\nApart from the site resonance frequency, thickness, average shear wave velocity for soil package \n\nestimation and also 1D shear wave velocity profile from its inversion with dispersion curve, the  \n\nH/V curve can be used for some other application as well. The shear wave velocity obtained \n\nfrom the MASW survey is considered as 1D Vs representative structure of the investigation site. \n\nAs we showed in this study, the peak frequency of the H/V provides a very good approximation \n\nof the bedrock depth if the thickness-frequency relation for a locality is available. The dispersion \n\n\n\n \n \n\n151 \n \n\ncurve at IAG site has been used to estimate thickness-frequency relation and to evaluate whether \n\nthe bedrock topography at the site is isotropic or there is some azimuth variation. We rotated the \n\nhorizontal components of the seismic noise recording at     steps from    at North to       at \n\nSouth. The rotated horizontal components are divided by the vertical Fourier spectral amplitude. \n\nThis rotated H/V curves are documented for this azimuth (Fig 10.25). The shift of peak \n\nfrequencies with azimuth is used to estimate the thickness of soft sediment package for that \n\nazimuth from the thickness-frequency relation (Fig 10.26). \n\n \n\nFig.10.25. Shows the shift of the peak frequency of H/V curves for rotating horizontal components for IAG site. \n\n \n\nFig.10.26 Shows the shift of peak frequency with the azimuth (left), while on the right shows the thickness of \n\nsediment package estimated from the peak frequency shift with azimuth (for IAG site). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n152 \n \n\n \n\nFig.10.27 Shows the shift of the peak frequency of H/V curves for rotating horizontal component for IGC site. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig.10.28 Shows the shift of peak frequency with the azimuth (left), while on the right shows the thickness of \n\nsediment package estimated from the peak frequency shift with azimuth (for IGC site). \n\nThese analysis indicate that there is a upwelling of the bedrock topography within the subsurface \n\nalong these azimuth range         . We tried to link this to the surface topography of the USP \nsite (Fig 10.29). The increase of elevation and bedrock appearance toward the westward \n\ndirection might be an indication of the bedrock topography continuation within the subsurface.  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n153 \n \n\n \n\nFig.10.29 Shows the topographical map of USP (the boundary of campus are shown in dotted line); filled arrow \n\nshows IAG site while two-headed arrow show IGC site. \n\nThe second aspect that could be investigated by the simple H/V curve analysis is the dominancy \n\nof a higher mode of Rayleigh waves at a site. The dispersion curves of the six MASW profiles at \n\nthe Bebedouro site are shown in the Fig 10.30. The dispersion images of these six profiles show \n\nhigher mode appearance in Beb 16, Beb 4a, Beb 11 and Beb 7 (Fig 10.30). The six H/V curves at \n\nthese sites are shown in Fig (10.9). A link could be established between the shape of the H/V \n\ncurve and higher mode dominancy in the dispersion images by this observation that, when there \n\nis one clear peak and trough and there is no such other peak comparable to the prominent peak of \n\nthe H/V curve, the dispersion image shows the dispersion curve and most probably fundamental \n\nmode such as in Beb 4b in Fig (10.9). However, when there is either a flat or two peaks within \n\nthe H/V curve, the dispersion image is dominated by higher mode Rayleigh waves. The similar \n\nobservation were extended for the other two sites with two MASW profiles each one at IAG and \n\nIGC and two at Col\u00f4nia site (Fig 10.31). The H/V curves of these sites (Fig 10.32) shows only \n\none clear peak and trough while the dispersion images recorded at these sites shows only one \n\nprominent dispersion curve on the dispersion image. Though this observation was verified at 10 \n\nsites, we still believe that this behaviour of H/V need more detailed analysis to conclude it in \n\ndetail. However, the results from these sites dispersion images and the H/V curves shape \n\ncomparison shows that if the H/V curve shape shows a single peak and trough with no flat or \n\nsecond comparable peak, the site characteristics do not allow the higher mode dominancy of \n\nRayleigh waves. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n154 \n \n\n \n\nFig.10.30 Shows the dispersion images of six locations at Bebedouro area. \n\n \n\nFig.10.31  Shows the dispersion images (a) IAG site (b) IGC site (c) Colonia 1 and (d) Colonia 2 \n\n\n\n \n \n\n155 \n \n\n \n\nFig.10.32 Shows the H/V curves for IAG, IGC and Colonia sites of the MASW profiles shown in Fig 10.31. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n156 \n \n\n \n\nChapter 11: Conclusions \n \n\nThe most important part of any study is to draw the conclusion. However, to draw the conclusion \n\nabout an analyzed phenomenon might always need improvement and further testing. So here, it \n\nwill be tried to note down only those phenomena which we have found by analyzing our \n\ntheoretical and experimental data. \n\nThe modelling of the H/V curve and its linkage with a physical phenomenon remained always \n\nthe prime concern for all the study performed using the H/V spectral ratio curves. We have \n\nanalyzed all the available and presented so far techniques for the modeling of the H/V curve and \n\ncompared the result of each modelling technique with the experimental H/V curve measured at \n\nthe borehole site. The technique which gives the best correlation with experimental data is the \n\nsurface wave modelling of the H/V curve. However, the shape of H/V curve is mainly controlled \n\nby the Rayleigh ellipticity fundamental mode. The Nakamura and Diffused field assumption are \n\nexcluded from the inversion analysis due to the results of some previous studies and also due to \n\nthe deviation of the experimental curve from the model curve by these techniques for our site. \n\nThe main advantage of the H/V curve techniques is that it provides the shear resonance \n\nfrequency of the site. The technique provides an easy, cheap and fast method to obtain this \n\nfundamental resonance frequency. The type of waves around the peak of the H/V curve always \n\nremained the topic of discussion. Our analysis showed that the H/V curve peak provides a better \n\nrepresentation of the shear wave resonance frequency because of all the elastic seismic waves \n\ncontributed around the peak. The other technique of surface waves and Rayleigh waves \n\ndominancy shows better replication of fundamental resonance frequency but only for a higher \n\nPoisson ratio. Similarly, the deviations from the shear resonance frequencies were checked for \n\nthe velocity contrast between the soil and bedrock. The H/V curve for the mostly used modelling \n\ntechniques shows that peak frequency changes its behavior when the shear wave velocity \n\ncontrast is 2.6. At the contrast velocity of the 3.6, the peak frequency deviation of the H/V curve \n\nfrom the shear resonance frequency is lesser. Similarly, the thickness of soil variations were \n\nchecked for the peak frequency deviation from shear wave resonance frequency and it was found \n\nthat when the shear wave contrast is 3.6 or higher the deviation from the shear wave resonance \n\nfrequency is greatly reduced. The P wave contrast and density contrast show no effect on the \n\npeak frequency deviation of the H/V curve.   \n\nThe shape of the H/V curve was checked with the three main techniques and it was found that \n\nthe shape of the H/V curve is mainly dominated by the fundamental mode of the Rayleigh wave \n\nellipticity curve. Also the shape deviation of the H/V curve from the one layer model was \n\nanalyzed for different number of contrasting interfaces (layers) within the subsurface. It gives a \n\n\n\n \n \n\n157 \n \n\ndubious and unclear result, however, the shape deviation for the H/V curve was found to be \n\nsensitive to a maximum number of 6 layers within the subsurface. \n\nThe peak frequency of the H/V curve provides a good idea about the thickness of the soft \n\nsediment packages if the shear wave velocity information at the near surface is known. The peak \n\nof the H/V curve is strongly depended on the ratio between the thickness of the soil to the shear \n\nwave velocity (average shear wave travel time). The same average travel time gives an \n\nanalogous peak. The peak and thickness relation is mostly utilized for a larger area to get quickly \n\nthe idea of the soft sediment thickness from the H/V curve peak. We have compared the results \n\nof experimental H/V curve peak frequency relations for the Bebedouro area with two equations \n\nobtained mathematically.  These two equations showed very close results to one another. We \n\ndemonstrated that the dispersion curve can be directly inverted to shear and depth values in \n\nwhich will result in the velocity at one-meter depth and the shear wave velocity increase trend \n\nwith depth upon regression analysis. These two values can be used to obtain the thickness-\n\nfrequency relation and also, these values can be used for the ellipticity curve alone inversion to \n\nobtain the subsurface 1D shear wave velocity profile. \n\nThe part of ellipticity which carries the most important information about the subsurface was \n\nalso checked. The only part of the ellipticity which it changes its shape with the subsurface \n\nvelocity contrast is the right limb of the ellipticity curve. The dispersion and ellipticity curves \n\nhave different sensitivities to the different layer parameters. The inversion of each of the target \n\ncurves alone (dispersion and ellipticity curve) provides a trade-off between shear wave velocity \n\nand soft sediment thickness. To invert the ellipticity curve alone, some supplementary \n\ninformation was required. We analyzed the different parts of the ellipticity curve inversion with \n\nvelocity increase trend information. We found that right limb of the ellipticity curve provides a \n\nbetter result of the inversion. However, as the peak frequency contains information regarding to \n\nthe depth of the contrasting interface between soft sediment and seismic bedrock cover, the left \n\nlimb of the ellipticity curve was also included in the inversion to constrained the sediments \n\nthickness. The misfit function was analyzed for both the targets (dispersion and ellipticity curve) \n\nto weight properly both of the target during the inversion. We had defined a new strategy to \n\nweight both the targets and had shown that it provides a better result for the theoretical case. \n\nUnfortunately, it did not provide a better result for the experimental data inversion. It might need \n\nsome more terms (conditions) to be included which will be analyzed in a future work. To \n\nimprove the result of joint of inversion, we have adopted trial and error procedure by adjusting \n\nthe weight of one target at the expense of the other. \n\nLessons were learned from the theoretical analysis tested on data of the three sites, where the \n\ndispersion and seismic ambient noise recording were made. It has been extensively observed that \n\nH/V curves always contain the effects of Love and body waves, especially around the peak, but \n\nthe Love wave effect extends for the whole frequency range. This contamination drives the shape \n\nof the H/V curve to deviates from the Rayleigh ellipticity curve. Two techniques were tested to \n\nremove the effect of Love waves from the horizontal component of noise wavefield and make \n\n\n\n \n \n\n158 \n \n\nthe shape of the H/V curve closer and true representative of the fundamental mode of Rayleigh \n\nwave ellipticity. The methods were tested for a theoretical curve by comparing with an \n\nexperimental curve at the borehole site (USP area). The result of joint inversion of ellipticity and \n\ndispersion curves at a borehole site was compared with direct measurements which gave a very \n\ngood correlation. Similarly, the joint inversion result was made for the other areas too. The \n\nvelocity increase trend at the Bebedouro and Col\u00f4nia areas were used along with ellipticity \n\ncurves to obtain the shear wave velocity profiles. \n\nThe H/V curve was checked for the peak frequency variation with azimuth. If the peak frequency \n\nis varying, we can infer that soil thickness is also varying with azimuth.  \n\nThe shape of the H/V curve was checked with dispersion curve for ten different acquisition \n\npoints, which showed that when the H/V curve has one peak and the dispersion curve shows \n\ntrough a single dispersion curve, it is most probably the fundamental mode. However, when \n\nthere were two or a flat peak, the H/V dispersion image at the same site showed higher mode \n\nappearance and existence. \n\nThe future work includes some more detail insights of the H/V curve variation with azimuth and \n\nits linkage with site geological setting. This could be potentially utilized in the area of land \n\nsliding to identify the direction of maximum slope. The shape of the H/V curve linkage with \n\nRayleigh waves fundamental and higher modes dominancy needs further testing too. Three \n\ncomponent sensors array analysis (SPAC) is under consideration to find out the fraction of Love \n\nwave contribution to horizontal component of noise wavefield. If this fraction is somehow find \n\nout with time and site variability, this will help to simply reduce the effect of Love by dividing \n\nthe H/V spectral ratio with that factor and ready to go for inversion with dispersion curve. The \n\nmisfit function are desired to be modified to give better result for experimental curves joint \n\ninversion. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n159 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n160 \n \n\nArticles \nJournal Publication \n\n1.

So, Aki and Richards (2002) proposed that it beings transforming it into a \n\nradiation condition that no up-going waves are found in the bottom of the half-space. Moreover, since its \n\ninteresting to define the surface wave curves as a function of the desired V\nS\n(z) and V\n\nP\n(z) structure, for \n\npractical reasons, the link between surface waves and the body waves is expressed explicitly. Therefore, \n\nas the first step of the procedure, the motion stress vectors (r\n1\n, r\n\n2\n, r\n\n3\n, r\n\n4\n) or (l\n\n1\n, l\n\n2\n) (i.e., r and l in vector \n\nnotation, respectively), are related to the displacement amplitudes. Hereafter w, of up going (P\nu \n\nfor P \n\nwaves and S\nu \n\nfor S waves) and down going (P\nd \n\nfor P waves and S\nd \n\nfor S waves) waves travelling across \n\nthe medium, through the Eq.A1. For Love waves (Aki and Richards, 2002) the relationship between the \n\namplitudes of S\nd \n\nand S\nu \n\nwaves traveling across the homogeneous half space and the motion stress vector at \n\nthe top of the half space (z = z\nn\n) can be expressed in the form \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n175 \n \n\n \n  \n  \n\n = \n       \n\n         \n   \n\n \n\n  \n             A5 \n\nor in vector notation (l = Fw), where ? = (k\n2 \n\n+ ?\n2\n\n/?\n2\n\n)\n1/2\n\n, ? = (?/?)\n1/2\n\n. While the relation for Rayleigh \n\nwaves has the form of \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n     \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n               A6 \n\n \n\nIn this equation, the matrix F is factored as \n\nF=    \n\n  \n  \n\n      \n\n          \n\n  \n  \n\n          \n      \n\n  \n   \n\n     \n\n         \n\n  \n   \n\n         \n      \n\n *   \n\n    \n\n \n \n \n\n \n    \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n   \n\n        A7 \n\n \n\nor in vector notation (r =Fw), where ? = (k\n2 \n\n+ ?\n2\n\n/?\n2\n\n)\n1/2 \n\nand ? = ((?+2?)/?)\n1/2\n\n. \n\n \n\nThe main advantage of using this formalization appears when the inversion of the relations l = Fw and r \n\n=Fw (w = F\n-1 \n\nl and w = F\n-1 \n\nr) are computed. Namely, the inverse, F\n-1\n\n, of  F (and also of each of the matrix \n\nfactors in A7  can be easily evaluated).  \n\nIn the second step of this procedure, the Thomson-Haskell method were used to apply the relation w = F\n-1 \n\nl and w = F\n-1 \n\nr to the motion stress vector at the depth z = z\nn\n. Thus, the amplitudes of up going and down \n\ngoing waves in the half-space may be expressed in terms of the motion stress vectors at the depth z = z\no\n. \n\nSimilarly to the eq. (A4) they assume the form  \n\n \n\nw\nn+1 \n\n= F\n-1\n\nn+1 \nG(z\n\nn\n,z\n\no\n) l(z\n\no\n) = B l(z\n\no\n)       A8 \n\nw\nn+1 \n\n= F\n-1\n\nn+1 \nG(z\n\nn\n,z\n\no\n) r(z\n\no\n) = B r(z\n\no\n)       A9 \n\n \n\nFinally, considering the radiation/boundary conditions assumed for the surface waves existence [S\nu\n\nn+1 \n= 0 \n\nand l\n2\n(z\n\no\n) = 0 for Love; P\n\nu\n\nn+1 \n= S\n\nu\n\nn+1 \n= 0 and r\n\n3\n(z\n\no\n) = r\n\n4\n(z\n\no\n) = 0 for Rayleigh waves we have \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n176 \n \n\n \n    \n\n \n\n \n = \n\n      \n      \n\n   \n      \n\n \n        A10 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    \n \n\n    \n \n\n \n  \n\n =   \n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n\n   \n  \n   \n   \n\n   \n\n      \n      \n\n \n \n\n      A11 \n\n \n\nClearly, nontrivial solution l and r from the above equations can be obtained when B\n21 \n\nin equation A10 \n\nand the sub-determinant (B\n31\n\nB\n42 \n\n\u2013 B\n41\n\nB\n32\n\n) in the A11 vanishes. \n\nIn conclusion, the equations \n\n \n\nB\n21 \n\n= 0          A12 \n\n \n\n \n      \n      \n\n           A13 \n\n \n\nare the eigenvalues of the A10 and A11, respectively.  \n\nAs a result, for evaluating the dispersion curves it is sufficient to find, for each frequency, ?/2?, and in \n\nthe correct order to clearly identify all modes, all the n roots k(n) of the equations (10 and 11). Moreover, \n\nit is clear that since the terms of the matrix B are related with the elastic parameters of the layers forming \n\nthe medium, the dispersion curves reflect the mechanical structure of the medium itself. However, Dunkin \n\n(1965) stated that the terms B\nij \n\nof the sub-determinant (13) can become very large during the process of \n\ncomputation. Therefore, the result of their subtraction could not have significant digits enough or even \n\nbecomes zero. As a result, this computational operation is not easy as it seems at a first glance, and if \n\ncomputers with high precision are not available, the phase velocity estimated could be severely biased. \n\nSome ways of solving that problem are either using the Laplace\u2019s development by minors (Dunkin, 1965 \n\nand Knopoff, 1964), or the layer-reduction method (Schwab and Knopoff, 1970), or the \n\nOrthonormalization method (Wang, 1999).  \n\nFrom a practical point of view, for each frequency, ?/2?, the roots search is performed along the slowness \n\naxis, k, by an iterative procedure of trial k\ni\n. Hence, the parameters k\n\nmin \nand k\n\nmax\n, associated to the V\n\nRmax \n\nand V\nRmin \n\nor the V\nLmax \n\nand V\nLmin\n\n, are identified first. Then, the others roots in the range (k\nmin \n\n- k\nmax\n\n) are \n\ngenerally obtained by means of some robust non-linear and non-analytical function, as the bracketing \n\ntechniques combined with bisection proposed by Hisada (1995). We used a code which is based on the \n\nDunkin's procedure of solving that problem. The reference for further documentation can be found on \n\nreport number D14.07 of SESAME project (SESAME). \n\nAfter the terms of the matrix B (A11) are known, it is possible also to evaluate the ellipticity curves \n\n(r\n1\n(z\n\no\n)/r\n\n2\n(z\n\no\n)) for different modes of the Rayleigh waves. In fact, from the equation (A11) we can see that \n\n\n\n \n \n\n177 \n \n\n  \n\nB\n31 \n\nr\n1\n(z\n\no\n) = B\n\n32 \nr\n\n2\n(z\n\no\n)         A14 \n\n \n\nand consequently, the ellipticity correspond to the relationship \n\n \n\n      \n\n      \n=-\n\n   \n\n   \n            A15 \n\n \n\nThis ratio is an imaginary number and, when it is positive, the particle motion is prograde. Conversely, \n\nwhen it is negative, the motion is retrograde. Since, for each frequency, the terms B\nij \n\nreflect the elastic \n\nproperties of the medium at a different depth and also by the ellipticity curve, the mechanical \n\nstructure of the medium can be found."}]}}}
