Taking into consideration former studies \n\nwhich have analyzed different motives of traditional and emerging donors\u2019 \n\ndevelopment assistance and the controversy on Chinese ODA, this work chooses \n\nspecifically one area, the oil resources, and studies one representative emerging donor, \n\nChina, in order to find out if its aid flows to African oil-producing countries are \n\nstimulated by their oil resources. The study works on data of Chinese ODA from 2000 \n\nto 2014 and of crude petroleum imports during the same period of time, with regard to \n\n6 main African oil-producing countries. Using bivariate correlation test and linear \n\nregression test, no correlation or causality between these variables is observed. Hence, \n\nthe test result demonstrates that the oil resources condition doesn\u2019t have a significance \n\ninfluence to Chinese development assistance to African countries. \n\n \n\n \n\nKey-words: Official development aid, China, oil resources.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\t 4\t\n\nResumo \n\nOs doadores emergentes de ajuda p\u00fablica ao desenvolvimento, designadamente \n\npa\u00edses membros non-tradicionais do Comit\u00ea de Ajuda ao Desenvolvimento, t\u00eam \n\natra\u00eddo um amplo interesse.

According to the report of Fourth High Level Forum of \n\nOECD (2011), the new partnership was established based on the \u201ccommon principles, \n\nobjects and differential commitments\u201d. Since there\u2019s no obligation for them to obey \n\nthe regulations set by OECD, these emerging donors aren\u2019t generally recognized. \n\nCompared with traditional donors, their actions are less transparent and the aid flows \n\nare given by various modalities. Many people worry about its nature and consider the \n\naid as rogue, irresponsible, which could \u201cundermine the improvements that have been \n\nmade over the past several decades\u201d (Walz et. al, 2010).  \n\nAs a representative example among the emerging donors, Chinese official \n\ndevelopment aid\u2019s performance and effect are under controversy. It became also an \n\nimportant topic to scholars and investigators of different institutions and organizations. \n\nWithout periodic report about its action and a unified quantifying standard, the \n\ncalculation of its amount turns out to be uncertain. There are more disputes on its \n\nmotive, allocation and actual effects. Chinese development assistance is alleged to be \n\n\u201crogue aid\u201d by some scholars and journalists and they believe the China\u2019s aid flows \n\nare mainly guided by strategic interests, including raw materials, international politics \n\netc., other than humanitarian needs of recipients (Na\u00edm, 2007; Wagenvoord, 2016). \n\nHowever, a growing number of works investigate different determinants of China\u2019s \n\nODA and the results are inconsistent with former arguments and opinions.  \n\nTaking into account all controversies, my study aims to analyze only one aspect \n\nof all main effective factors, namely the recipient countries\u2019 oil resources. According \n\nto some statements, African countries receive an increasing amount of Chinese \n\nofficial assistance, because of their oil reserves and exploitation\u2019s prospect. They \n\nbelieve that importation of oil resources took an important position in China\u2019s \n\ndevelopment strategy and it motivates China\u2019s assistance. On one hand, this work \n\n\n\n\t 6\t\n\nuses China\u2019s petroleum imports data to explore this resource condition of African \n\ncountries. By utilizing OEC Dataset, which reconciles data reported to the United \n\nNations Statistics Division, the importance of each African recipient in terms of \n\npetroleum imports is represented. On the other hand, considering the uncertainty of \n\nChinese total ODA to each country, a reliable database of ODA\u2019s quantity is also \n\nessential for the investigation. On the basis of Tracking Underreported Financial \n\nFlows (TUFF) Methodology, the AidData's Global Chinese Official Finance Dataset \n\ncollects statistics of Chinese ODA to each African country during 2000-2014. After \n\nfiltering and eliminating the null and invalid value, the study therefore utilizes \n\nstatistics of petroleum imports and ODA flows of China with regard to six African \n\ncountries with 270 observations. \n\n     On the aspect of structure, the work is divided into 5 sections. Chapter 1 \n\npresents principle motives of ODA of different donors, including traditional and \n\nemerging ones. Chapter 2 presents the background and brief history of Chinese \n\nODA\u2019s development and the important role the country plays in respect of Africa. \n\nChapter 3 mainly explains the methodology, database applied in this work and case \n\nstudy. The conclusion of work will be summarized in the last section.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\t 7\t\n\nChapter I \n\n Aid Motives of Traditional and Emerging Donors  \n\n    Development aid is always been motivated by various factors. The developing \n\ncountries in need put forward their requirements and donors consider carefully the \n\nrecipients\u2019 condition, aid model, amount, transference channel and other elements, in \n\norder to make an appropriate decision. Generally speaking, global foreign assistance \n\ndevelops dynamically, presenting diverse characteristics in specific phases, owing to \n\nhistorical evolutions. Each country\u2019s aid decision and aid policy can be affected by \n\nmany factors in economic, political, cultural, historical, geostrategic and humanitarian \n\nareas. Not only the self-interests of donors, but also the conditions of potential \n\nrecipients like autocracy level, governance quality are under consideration. In this \n\nsection, I\u2019ll enumerate the principle determinants of traditional donors, namely the \n\nDAC donors and the emerging donors, which have currently been involved in the \n\nofficial development aid stage.  \n\n1.1 Motives of traditional donors\u2019 foreign aid \n\nSome former studies have investigated the principle determinants, in terms of aid \n\nflows, provided by traditional donors in Development Assistance Committee (DAC).  \n\nThe study of Berth\u00e9lemy (2002) takes traditional donors as targets. It covers 137 \n\nrecipient countries, 22 DAC donors and aid flows over 20 years (1980-1999). It uses a \n\npanel study with three dimensions (recipient-year-donor), because of the huge \n\ndatabase with nearly 60,000 observations. All determinants are divided into two \n\ngroups: the \u201cbeneficiary needs and policy performance variables\u201d which show the \n\nrecipients\u2019 status, and donors\u2019 self-interests variables, which include variables on \n\nbehalf of aid providers\u2019 interests and strategies. Beneficiary needs, namely the \n\npoverty level of recipients, are represented by income per capita and the policy \n\nperformance consists of political rights, civil liberty, and economic and social policy\u2019s \n\n\n\n\t 8\t\n\nquality. In part of self-interests of donors, trade relationship and historical-political \n\nties are emphasized and analyzed. The main results are that, donors are prone to \n\nprovide assistance to countries with positive social performance, especially after the \n\ncold war. At the same time, countries with good economic performance seemed to be \n\nrewarded by donors in 1990s. From the viewpoint of donors\u2019 self-interests, the aid \n\nflows\u2019 determinant turned from politics and historical factors to \u201cpragmatic \n\nconsiderations about commercial interests\u201d.  \n\nHowever bilateral and multilateral assistance manifests different features. The \n\nstudy of Berth\u00e9lemy (2006) takes into analysis both bilateral and multilateral aid\u2019s \n\nperformance and motives. Based on assistance\u2019s statistics of 22 DAC-OECD \n\ncountries and principal multilateral donors, from 1981 to 1999, the roles played by \n\nfactors, including both donors\u2019 self-interests and recipients\u2019 needs and merits are \n\nevaluated. Commercial linkages and geopolitical relationship constitute donors\u2019 \n\nprinciple motives. With regard of recipients\u2019 part, beneficiary needs are measured by \n\nincome per capita, and recipients\u2019 merits are reflected by quality of political \n\ngovernance, quality of policies and institutions. He found that comparing with \n\nmotives related to developmental objectives, self-interests play a predominant role in \n\nbilateral aid, except Switzerland and a few Nordic donors. Commercial interests have \n\na larger effect on aid decisions, than geopolitical motives. Multilateral aid, excluding \n\nEuropean Commission (EC)\u2019s assistance, strongly responds to recipients\u2019 needs. \n\nHowever, EC has a special performance, with little attention given to recipients\u2019 \n\nneeds and merits, and a strong bias in favor of the African, Caribbean and Pacific \n\nGroup of States (ACP).  \n\nBandyopadhyay et al (2006) focus on the traits of recipients, namely the factors \n\nincluding economic and physical needs, civil/political rights, and government \n\neffectiveness, controlling donors\u2019 self-considerations. They use the data of three years, \n\n1995, 2000 and 2003 in the post-Cold War era, in total 395 observations. The \n\nindicators standing for recipients\u2019 needs are GDP per capita and infant mortality. Civil \n\nliberties and political rights indexes are used to evaluate the level of human right. \n\nMoreover, the World Bank\u2019s governance indicators represent government \n\n\n\n\t 9\t\n\neffectiveness of recipients. The investigation reaches to conclusions, which are not \n\ncompletely consistent with the former researches. The empirical result shows that aid \n\nof post-Cold War era generally responded negatively to GDP per capita and positively \n\nto infant mortality, rights, and government effectiveness. The increasing emphasis on \n\naid effectiveness among aid donors\u2019 also strengthens the significance of their \n\ngovernance performance and institutions quality.  \n\n    Dollar et. al (2004) survey the allocation of foreign aid and its selectivity, based \n\non statistics of aid and variable indicators by 41 bilateral and multilateral donors/ \n\nagencies from 1984 to 2002. This paper focuses on situations of recipient countries, \n\nincludes two intuitive selectivity indexes, which are \u201cpolicy selectivity\u201d and \u201cpoverty \n\nselectivity\u201d. It aims to see if donors\u2019 assistance inclines to countries with sound \n\ninstitutions and policies, or countries with more urgency of money. They conclude \n\nthat today about three-fourths of target donors/agencies have a positive relationship \n\nbetween their allocations and sound institutions and policies of recipients. The \n\ncomparison with historical analysis results confirms the increasing importance of \n\ngood governance in aid allocation. Meanwhile aid agencies that are very policy \n\nfocused, are also very poverty focused, indicating that it is possible to target aid both \n\nto the countries where grave poverty and at the same time to countries with \n\nreasonably good governance.  \n\n1.2 Emerging donors and determinants of new donors\u2019 foreign aid decision. \n\nWith emerging or \u201creemerging\u201d of new donors and the development of \n\nSouth-South cooperation, we should also pay more attention to the performance of \n\nmajor new participants. The study of Walz et al (2010) shows the overall estimated \n\nofficial foreign aid value of non-traditional donors, which ranges from 8 to 31 percent \n\nof global gross ODA. It reveals that aid flows of some countries even reached the aim \n\nof 0.7% of gross national income, if calculated by the upper estimation. The emerging \n\ndonors follow basically three distinct models. The new novice of DAC and members \n\nof OECD but not DAC, like the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary and Turkey, \n\n\n\n\t 10\t\n\ngenerally follow the DAC guidelines. Arab donors follow one specific model. They \n\nhave some of the oldest, most established, and most generous aid programs in the \n\nworld and their foreign aid tends to predominately flow to other Arab countries. \n\nDifferent from the other two models, the Arab model remains primarily regional \n\nconcentration. Common culture, religion and language factors motivate the aid flow. \n\nThe last model, Southern Model is generalized based on assistance performance of \n\nother emerging donors, namely BRICS countries and Venezuela etc. Waltz et al point \n\nout that in this \u201chorizontal cooperation\u201d, the southern donors prefer to provide \n\nassistance to infrastructure projects and resource-rich countries have been popular \n\ntargets.  \n\nThe motives affecting aid flows are also divided in two aspects by many studies, \n\nrecipients\u2019 conditions and donors\u2019 self-interests, and represented by similar variables.  \n\nIn terms of emerging Central and Eastern European donors, their foreign aid \n\npolicies share the same characteristics. Szent-Iv\u00e1nyi (2010) examines the possible \n\nfactors affecting Visegr\u00e1d countries\u2019 aid allocation on the basis of data from 2001 to \n\n2008. The result shows that their foreign development assistance is not mainly \n\ninfluenced by poverty level or the government performance of the recipients. The \n\nmajor influential factors are geographic proximity and the former relations from the \n\nCommunist Era. Instead of recipients\u2019 needs and merits, they prefer to choose \n\ncountries with more relation to their political, security and economic interests.  \n\nThe work of Kili\u00e7 (2011) investigates the motives of Turkey, based on its foreign \n\naid towards Central Asia in the post-Soviet Era by using data from 1992 to 2008. Also \n\nthe author compares Turkey\u2019s official development behavior with three parallel \n\ndonors\u2019, namely Japan, United States and Russia, in order to demonstrate specific \n\ncharacteristics of each donor and particularity of Turkey. Owing to the strategic \n\nsignificance of this region, during 1990s it became a worldwide center of interests. \n\nFor United Stats, Russia and Japan, the influence of economic interest is obvious and \n\nthe oil and gas reserves of potential recipients motivate the aid flowing into specific \n\nregions. No close relationship between foreign aid and the needs or merits of recipient \n\ncountries has been found in the case of US, Russia and Japan. His findings have \n\n\n\n\t 11\t\n\ndiscounted the role of humanitarian need, democracy, and human rights of recipient \n\ncountries in aid policies\u2019 concern. However, a common factor in allocating ODA in \n\nCentral Asia region is for security concern, namely \u201ccounter-terrorism, drug \n\ntrafficking, human smuggling, and the prevention of refugees\u201d. Turkey\u2019s performance, \n\ncomparing with the countries referred above is more consistent with the essence of \n\ndevelopment. Though it cannot be considered as totally altruistic, Turkey\u2019s aid aims \n\nto transit recipient countries \u201cfrom totalitarian to more democratic regimes, from \n\ncommand economies to free-market economies, and from closed societies to more \n\npluralistic societies\u201d (Kili\u00e7, 2011). It gives a considerable humanitarian concerns and \n\nhelps the Post-Soviet Central Asian states to achieve social and economic \n\nindependence, to integrate into international system, also seeking its own economic \n\nand politics interests. \n\nIn terms of countries following Southern Model, as a member of BRICS, \n\nBrazil\u2019s performance attracts attention and becomes a popular target of researches. \n\nBurges (2014) studies the Brazil\u2019s motives to implement development assistance \n\nprojects. The paper concludes: \u201cthere is a genuine and deep concern with global \n\npoverty alleviation in Brazil, but this does not preclude Brazilian policy makers from \n\nusing aid and development-related activities from advancing the national interest\u201d \n\n(Burge, 2014). Brazil\u2019s self-serving economic and political interests remain to be a \n\nmajor motivator, which are cleverly expressed in a more inclusive way.  \n\nAnother BRICS country, India has gained also a heavyweight. Its development \n\ncooperation history traces back to pre-independence interim government, before \n\nattaining dependence in 1947 (Forum for Indian Development Cooperation, 2016). As \n\na developing country, Indian development cooperation policy is shaped by the \u201cone \n\nworld philosophy\u201d, development partnership rather than donor-recipient relationship, \n\nwhich is distinct to traditional donors guideline. Based on the data from 2008 to 2012 \n\nof AidData, Fuchs et al (2012) investigated two pairs of hypotheses of Indian aid \n\nallocation\u2019s motives to validate if India responds to economic needs of developing \n\ncountries; if it prefers countries at a similar stage of development; and if the aid flows \n\nare leaded by the country\u2019s political and commercial self-interests etc. According to \n\n\n\n\t 12\t\n\nempirical results, Indian development aid shows some need orientation but still \n\nmotivated more by commercial interests. Countries at a similar developmental stage \n\nhave a larger probability of entering India\u2019s aid program (without receiving larger aid \n\namounts). Meanwhile, this \u201cneedy\u201d donor cares more about its own needs instead of \n\nrecipients\u2019 demands. Comparing with Scandinavian countries, United States, Japan, \n\nthe three largest EU countries, South Korea and United Arab Emirates, the preference \n\nof countries geographically close is more obvious to Indian developmental assistance.  \n\n1.3 Controversy over Chinese ODA\u2019s motives \n\nIn case of China, the performance of its official development assistance is \n\ncontroversial. So do the motives of ODA. Huang et al (2013) develop their \n\ninvestigation mainly from the viewpoint of self-interests of Chinese development \n\nassistance. The study illustrates the transformation of Chinese assistance\u2019s strategy. \n\nBefore the Reform and Open-Up Policy, Chinese ODA was motivated principally by \n\npolitical factors, and aimed to help recipients that were struggling to establish national \n\ngovernment, achieve independence and development of economy. After \n\nimplementing Reform and Open-Up Policy, especially from mid-1990s, the concern \n\nmoved gradually to economic construction and aid policy has been driven gradually \n\nby economic factors. The guideline transferred to \u201cdiplomacy serves economy\u201d. The \n\narticle affirms that via cooperation projects, apart from increasing the local \n\nemployment and tax income, and realizing development of recipient countries, \n\nChinese companies take the positive measures to develop their business and carry out \n\ncooperative projects with local government and companies, stimulating exportation \n\nand expanding foreign markets.  \n\nLengauer (2011) divides major factors into economic, political and ideological \n\naspects. The economic strategy of ODA lies in its huge necessity of natural resources \n\nand commercial benefits. According to Lengauer, along with the astounding \n\ndevelopment of economy, the quantity of raw materials and energy required by \n\nproduction arouse rapidly. It\u2019s claimed that, by means of foreign assistance, China is \n\n\n\n\t 13\t\n\nable to get the resources more easily. Meanwhile, opening up the export markets and \n\nsetting up manufacturing plants abroad could be another major motives of China\u2019s \n\ndevelopment aid. In terms of political aspect, the objective of consolidating \n\nOne-China Policy, and getting an increasing global influence are main considerations. \n\nAlso the concerns of regional security and Uighur conflict affect China\u2019s decision. \n\nBesides that, it intends to spread its values and strength the soft power, increasing \n\ninfluence by its foreign aid in ideological area.  \n\nChinese development assistance is alleged to be \u201crogue aid\u201d and criticized by \n\nsome scholars and journalists, as they believe the ODA of China is mainly guided by \n\nstrategic interests other than humanitarian needs of recipients. They affirmed that \n\nChinese aid is stimulated only by the self-interests including money, raw materials, \n\nideological agenda and international politics, etc. (Na\u00edm, 2007; Wagenvoord, 2016). \n\nHowever there is a growing number of econometric works investigating different \n\ndeterminants of Chinese aid flows. The results show an inconsistency with the former \n\nstatements of doubt. For example, Broich (2017) applied the OLS estimation with the \n\npurpose of verifying if China prefers to help countries with authoritarian system and \n\nthe conclusion is that Chinese official development finance doesn\u2019t tend to help more \n\nauthoritarian countries. He found out also the major influential factors should be: \n\n\u201cwhether a country recognizes the People\u2019s Republic of China (RPC) or Taiwan \n\n(Republic of China, ROC) and whether English is considered one of the three most \n\ncommon languages in the recipient country.\u201d Meanwhile, the behaviors of traditional \n\ndonors are proved to have egoistic characteristics (Osei et al, 2004), not so altruistic \n\nas claimed. \n\n1.4 Conclusion \n\nThe motives of official development aid are diversified and allocated in different \n\nareas. Each country or agency manifests different characteristics, which vary in \n\ndifferent historical phases. Based on the studies referred above, we can summarize \n\nthat no matter the aid is given by the traditional donors, namely DAC-OECD \n\n\n\n\t 14\t\n\ncountries, or by the emerging donors; no matter it is proceeded by bilateral or \n\nmultilateral method, the donors evaluate always its economic, political and \n\ngeostrategic interests and sometimes the ideological interest and security problem. On \n\nthe other hand, the recipients\u2019 needs and merits are two essential traits, which affect \n\nthe decision of donors. The donors are not pure altruistic nor pure egoistic. Generally \n\nspeaking, the multilateral assistance agencies pay more attention to recipients\u2019 needs \n\nand they emphasize in achieving the recipient countries\u2019 development, eradicating \n\npoverty and improving people\u2019s life quality. Bilateral aids are prone to be stimulated \n\nby donors\u2019 self-interests. The donor countries which hold geopolitical and historical \n\nrelationships with recipients seems to be more humanitarian, whose aid flows are \n\ndriven by recipients\u2019 necessities.  \n\nChina\u2019s situation may be more complicated. As concluded by Lengauer (2011), \n\nChinese aid flows may be induced by factors in various aspects, including economic, \n\npolitical and ideological areas. But the controversy remains, about if the aid flows are \n\nparticularly driven by the donor\u2019s self-interests, ignoring the recipients with actual \n\nneeds or merits. The importance of natural resources is referred by many studies, but \n\nno consistency has been reached. This paper, therefore, will investigate this issue via \n\nindexes of Chinese ODA and oil resources\u2019 abundance of recipient countries to find \n\nout if oil resources play an important part in influencing Chinese assistance.  \n\nChapter II  \n\nBackgrounds and Brief History of Chinese ODA and Chinese \n\nODA Relative to Africa \n\n    During the foreign aid history of more than 60 years, China experienced various \n\ncrucial reforms and transformations. In different historical periods, the aid policies \n\nand aid flows\u2019 characteristics manifest diverse features. There\u2019s no doubt that Africa \n\nplays an essential role in the evolution of Chinese foreign aid. In this section, \n\n\n\n\t 15\t\n\ntherefore, I\u2019d like to present briefly the profile and history of Chinese ODA, and \n\ndepict particularly the development of Chinese foreign aid to Africa, emphasizing the \n\nrespective characteristics of aid flow in different phases and the role played by \n\nAfrican countries. \n\n2.1 Profile of China\u2019s foreign aid and its brief history \n\n    Given an overall view, the history of Chinese official development aid began \n\nfrom 1950s, when North Korea and Vietnam started to receive its assistance. There \n\nare several ways to divide Chinese official development aid history. Dreher et al \n\n(2015) divide chronologically Chinese aid policy into five phases: 1955-1969, \n\n1970-1978, 1979-1989, 1990-1995, and 1996-2006. Also on the basis of studies and \n\nChina\u2019s White Paper of Foreign Aid, several events, which are crucial and accelerated \n\nthe development of Chinese official development aid, serve as boundaries of phases. \n\nAfter the establishing of People\u2019s Republic of China, in the beginning of 1950s, China \n\nprovided economic aid and technical assistance to few countries. After Asian-African \n\nConference, which was held in 1955, the number of recipient countries increased \n\ngradually and the recipients located \u201cexclusively in Africa, Arabian Peninsula and \n\nChina\u2019s immediate neighborhood\u201d. In 1964, the Chinese government declared Eight \n\nPrinciples for Economic Aid and Technical Assistance to Other Countries. The core \n\ncontent of these eight principles consisted in equality, mutual benefit and no strings \n\nattached. The China\u2019s foreign aid policy was therefore formulated.  \n\nIn 1971, China resumed the legal seat in United Nations\u2019 Security Council. The \n\nrecovery of identity permitted the country to join into the multilateral aid projects of \n\nsubordinate organizations of UN. From 1950 to 1978, China\u2019s foreign aid developed \n\nrapidly, with an increasing aid amount and expanding scale. The recipients number \n\nreached 66, 45 of them were African countries. The aid in this period manifested \n\nobvious political and security objectives. However, this significant growth caused \n\nalso problems. One of them was the discordance of foreign assistance\u2019s scale and \n\nnational strength. From 1953 to 1978, China\u2019s foreign aid took 3.11% of national \n\n\n\n\t 16\t\n\nfiscal expenditure on average. During the years 1972-1974 the ratio surpassed 6%. \n\nThe number is normally 1% to other donors (Hu, 2014).  \n\nIn 1978, Deng Xiaoping took the leadership of the Communist Party and he put \n\nforward the Reform and Open-Up Policy, after which the market principles were \n\nintroduced to and national economy was opened gradually to foreign investment and \n\ninternational trade. The policy was implemented in different economic sections, \n\nincluding ODA of China. The reform on development aid was initiated during the 90s \n\nwith the emphasis on diversifying the channels and sources of assistance. In 1993, the \n\n\u201cForeign Aid Fund for Joint Ventures and Cooperative Projects\u201d was set up, in order \n\nto stimulate cooperation on business and production between the Chinese SME and \n\nforeign enterprise receptors. In 1995, the concessional loans (medium and long-term \n\nlow-interest loans) were introduced, which let Chinese foreign aid transit to a \n\ncompletely different phase (Dreher, et al, 2015). The reform widened the source of \n\ndevelopment aid and extended the approach to aid provision, because grants and \n\ninterest-free loans were the primary instruments of China\u2019s development aid in \n\nperiods before (Brautigam, 2011). ODA of China maintains the rapid growth in 21st \n\ncentury. During 2004-2009, the average growth rate is 29,4%. In August 2010, \n\nChinese government held the National Conference on Foreign Aid, which indicates \n\ndevelopment in a new stage (Information Office of the State Council, People\u2019s \n\nRepublic of China, 2011). \n\n In terms of financial resources, Chinese foreign assistance consists of three \n\ntypes of aid flows: grants (aid gratis), interest-free loans and concessional loans. \n\nGrants are mainly distributed to construction of hospitals, schools and low-cost \n\nhouses, and other medium and small projects for social welfare. In addition, grants are \n\nused in projects of human resources development cooperation, technical cooperation, \n\nand assistance in kind and emergency humanitarian aid. Interest-free loans aim to help \n\nrecipient countries construct public facilities and improve people\u2019s livelihood. In \n\ncurrent years, interest-free loans are mainly provided to developing countries with \n\nrelatively good economic conditions. Concessional loans are allocated generally in \n\nproductive projects and large and medium-sized infrastructure projects, or in \n\n\n\n\t 17\t\n\nproviding complete plant, mechanical and electrical products, technical services and \n\nother materials, with the purpose of generating both economic and social benefits. \n\nThe first two types of assistance are planned and counted into China\u2019s state finances. \n\nThe Export-Import Bank of China is designated by Chinese government to distribute \n\nthe concessional loans. According to statistics of China\u2019s White Paper on Foreign Aid \n\n2011 and 2014, by the end of 2012, the total amount of aid flows reached 345.63 \n\nbillion RMB, in which, grants accounted for 40% with 138.52 billion RMB, \n\ninterest-free loans accounted for 24% of total aid value with 83.8 billion RMB, and \n\nconcessional loans 36% with 123.31 billion RMB.  \n\n\t\n\nFigure 1 Distribution of Chinese Foreign Aid by Aid Types (until the end of 2012) \n\nSource: Author\u2019s own calculation based on China\u2019s White Paper on Foreign Aid (2011 and 2014) \n\n    China provides foreign aid via eight forms, including \u201ccomplete projects, goods \n\nand materials, technical cooperation, human resource development cooperation, \n\nmedical teams sent abroad, emergency humanitarian aid, volunteer programs in \n\nforeign countries, and debt relief\u201d (Information Office of the State Council, People\u2019s \n\nRepublic of China, 2011). Both official documents emphasize the performance of \n\nChina\u2019s aid in the following fields: agriculture, industry, economic infrastructure, \n\npublic facilities, education, medical and health services and environment protection. \n\nGrants \n40% \n\nInterest-\nfree loans \n\n24% \n\nConcession\nal loans \n\n36% \nGrants \n\nInterest-free loans \n\nConcessional loans \n\n\n\n\t 18\t\n\n2.2 Chinese foreign aid to Africa and FOCAC \n\n    From 1956, China initiated its foreign assistance oriented to African countries. \n\nThe history can be generally divided into two phases, from 1950s to 1970s and from \n\n1980s till now, in which China\u2019s aid policy, motives, and aid measures\u2019 \n\ncharacteristics display considerable differences. \n\n    In the former period, confronting a tough international environment, namely \n\ndilemma between capitalist regime group and the USSR, China underwent a hard time. \n\nIn the same period, the national liberation movements in Africa were at the climax, in \n\nwhich conflict between colonist and nationalist powers was a remarkable sign of \n\nAfrican politics. Fighting together with African companions for liberation and \n\nindependence, China provided economic and technical assistance to support African \n\ncountries\u2019 movements. During the visit to Africa, the prime minister Zhou Enlai put \n\nforward the Five Principles for Relationship Development with African and Arab \n\nCountries and Eight Principles for Economic Aid and Technical Assistance to Other \n\nCountries. The latter policy signified the establishment of China\u2019s official aid policy \n\nto African countries. During 1956-1977, the assistance amount to Africa reached 2.47 \n\nbillion USD, taking up 58% of total China\u2019s foreign aid (Lu et al, 2007). Among all \n\nprojects in agriculture, transportation, hydraulic and hydroelectric engineering, \n\nTanzam Railway project is the typical and symbolic one. The construction initiated in \n\n1970 and took 6 years with the length of 1860 kilometers. There was a high cost of \n\nlabor and material resources, but it manifested China\u2019s sincerity and capacity. \n\nAfter entering the 1980s, the international environment faced by China and \n\nAfrican countries changed significantly. China implemented the Reform and \n\nOpen-Up Policy, which started a new era. Foreign aid\u2019s emphasis was gradually \n\nprone to economic construction. The strategic notion of assistance, attitude to interests \n\nand development aims of this country differed. From the side of Africa, along with \n\nthe independence of Namibia in 1990 and abolition of apartheid in South Africa in \n\n1994, the historical and political tasks have been accomplished. In order to achieve a \n\nfurther growth, the economic and social development came to be the prior goal. Under \n\n\n\n\t 19\t\n\nthis background, both two sides are willing to deepen cooperation. The \u201cFour \n\nPrinciples\u201d of achieving equity and mutual benefits, pursuing practical results, \n\nadopting diverse methods and channels, realizing joint development, which \n\npromulgated in 1982, became the guiding ideology of Chinese foreign aid to Africa in \n\nthe new era. During this period, various forums, summits and conferences were held. \n\nThe establishment and celebration of Forums on China-Africa Cooperation was one \n\nof the examples. \n\nForum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) is an important organization on \n\nthe basis of equality and mutual benefit and a mechanism of collective dialogue and \n\ndevelopment cooperation between China and African countries. China, 53 African \n\ncountries and African Union Commission hold the membership. Facing the challenges \n\nof globalization and the demands of new international political and economic order, \n\nthe First Ministerial Conference of FOCAC was held in Beijing, October of 2000, \n\nwhich marked its establishment. The purpose is to realize equal negotiation, enhance \n\nmutual understanding, expand consensus, strengthen friendship and stimulate \n\ncooperation between both sides. FOCAC aims to deepen the cooperation in achieving \n\nnew strategic partnership and to consolidate the consensuses and achievements made \n\nin the past. Its consultation mechanism consists in three levels: the Ministerial \n\nConference held every three years, attended by ministers in charge of international \n\neconomic cooperation and foreign affairs; the Senior Official Follow-up Meeting and \n\nSenior Official Preparatory Meeting for the Ministerial Conference held respectively \n\nin the previous year and a few days before the Ministerial Conference among \n\ndirector-general level officials of the competent departments; and meetings of African \n\ndiplomats in China with the Chinese Follow-up Committee held at least twice a year. \n\nAlso it was decided the Beijing Summit in 2006 to establish the regular political \n\nconsultation mechanism between foreign ministers of the two sides. \n\nChina, 44 African countries and African Union Commission took part in the \n\nFirst Ministerial Conference. After the meeting, \u00abBeijing Declaration of the Forum on \n\nChina-Africa Cooperation\u00bb and \u00abProgramme for China-Africa Cooperation in \n\nEconomic and Social Development\u00bb were promulgated. The documents emphasized \n\n\n\n\t 20\t\n\nthe compliance to purposes and principles of the UN Charter and the Charter of the \n\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence \n\nand other universally recognized principles governing relations among states. The \n\ndocuments also alleged the respect of human rights, fundamental freedoms, world\u2019s \n\ndiversity and the principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences. In \n\nterms of development assistance, Chinese government promised that aid would be \n\ncontinually supplied within South-South cooperation framework, based on the \n\nspecific conditions of African countries, focusing on promoting local industry, \n\nexploiting local materials and developing human resources. China was willing to \n\nextend technical cooperation in the engineering and other infrastructural projects. \n\nConcerning the hazards of heavy debt burden, FOCAC appealed for commitments of \n\nmain creditors and the maintenance of momentum on debt relief. China undertook to \n\nreduce or cancel debt of 10 billion RMB, which was owed by heavily indebted and \n\nleast developed African countries in the following two year.  \n\nThe Second Ministerial Conference took place in 2003 in Addis Ababa, capital \n\nof Ethiopia and published the \u00abAddis Ababa Action Plan (2004-2006)\u00bb (FOCAC, \n\n2009), which includes the follow-up actions of the Ministerial Conference Beijing \n\n2000 and the plan of cooperation between two sides during 2004-2006. The progress \n\nof NEPAD (New Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development) was highly recognized and \n\nthe cooperation in prior areas defined by NEPAD, such as infrastructure, prevention \n\nand treatment of infectious diseases, would be deepened within the framework of \n\nFOCAC. In respect of debt relief, China signed the protocols on debt relief and \n\ncancellation with 31 African least developed countries (LDC) and heavily indebted \n\npoor countries (HIPC) ahead of its committed schedule, which includes total 156 \n\nmatured debts, amounting to 10.5 billion RMB. China also agreed to provide \n\neconomic assistance to African countries \u201cwithout attaching any political conditions\u201d \n\nand increase grant assistance. \n\nIn the Beijing Summit and the Third Ministerial Conference in 2006, follow-up \n\nactions for 2007-2009 were planned between both sides. The cooperation in domains \n\nsuch as politics, economy, social development and international affairs was expected \n\n\n\n\t 21\t\n\nto be enlarged and promoted. Some specific targets were set up by \u00abForum On \n\nChina-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2007-2009) \u00bb in agriculture, debt \n\nrelief and development assistance, education, medical care and public health etc. \n\n(FOCAC, 2006). For example, Chinese government decided to expand the assistance \n\nscale to two times of it in 2006, promising a 3 billion USD concessional loans?2 \n\nbillion USD export buyer\u2019s credit and canceling interest free loans that had expired by \n\nthe end of 2005 of HIPCs and LDCs.  \n\nNearly all the promises were confirmed to be implemented by the document \n\npublished in the Fourth Ministerial Conference, which was organized in Sharm El \n\nSheikh, Egypt in 2009. The \u00abForum on China-Africa Cooperation Sharm El Sheikh \n\nAction Plan (2010-2012)\u00bb put forward more targets of China-Africa cooperation \n\nparticularly in the social areas. The importance of human resources, education and \n\ncultural exchange, science and technology were given an utmost attention by China. \n\nIn the Fifth Ministerial Conference in Beijing, both sides were delighted to see \n\nthat the cooperation continued to develop. They agreed to strengthen China-Africa \n\ndialogue mechanisms and promote the new type of China-Africa strategic partnership. \n\nAs in 2015, the achievements of Millennium Development Goals\u2019 fulfillment needed \n\nto be presented, Beijing Action Plan (2013-2015) pointed out the significance of \n\nworking together for implementing the targets established by UN High-Level Plenary \n\nMeeting on Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and United Nations Conference \n\non Sustainable Development (FOCAC, 2012). The two sides also appealed the \n\ninternational community to pay greater attention to sustainable development of \n\nAfrican and other developing countries.  \n\nThe Johannesburg Summit and the Sixth Ministerial Conference was held in \n\n2015 in the capital of South Africa. During the conference, Chinese government \n\npublished \u00abChina's Second Africa Policy Paper\u00bb which illustrates the establishment \n\nand development of China-Africa comprehensive strategic partnership and \n\nemphasizes the importance of consolidating the Sino-African community of shared \n\nfuture. \u00abThe Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Johannesburg Action Plan \n\n(2016-2018) \u00bb (FOCAC, 2015) highly appreciated the \u00abAgenda 2063\u00bb put forward by \n\n\n\n\t 22\t\n\nAfrican Union Commission, which aims to construct a united, integrated and \n\nprosperous Africa. According to the Plan, the Chinese side would continue to scale up \n\nits assistance to African countries within its capacity. It would give priority to \n\nenhancing cooperation with African countries in areas bound up with people's \n\nlivelihoods such as agriculture, health, infrastructure, education and human resources \n\ndevelopment etc. while increasing the effectiveness of assistance.  \n\nRecently in September 2-4, 2018, the Beijing Summit and the Seventh \n\nMinisterial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation was held in \n\nBeijing. The \u00abForum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-2021) \u00bb \n\nand \u00abBeijing Declaration-Toward an Even Stronger China-Africa Community with a \n\nShared Future\u00bb were published during this event. The implementation of the ten \n\ncooperation plans and the follow-up actions of the Johannesburg Action Plan was \n\nhighly recognized. The Beijing Action Plan (2019-2021) is aimed at expanding the \n\ncooperation in political, economic, social and cultural areas. Sub the provision of \n\ndevelopment cooperation, China promises to enhance assistance to African countries, \n\nparticularly the least developed countries. It will extend $15 billion USD of aid to \n\nAfrica. For thoes heavily indebted and poor countries, landlocked developing \n\ncountries and small island developing countries that have diplomatic relations with \n\nChina, the debt in the form of interest-free Chinese government loans, which dues to \n\nmature by the end of 2018 will be exempted. All the measures help deepening \n\nSouth-South cooperation and promote common interests. \n\nIn terms of financial resources\u2019 characteristics, before 1980s grants and \n\ninterest-free loans were two main types and proceeding complete projects was the \n\nbasic form. From the beginning of 1980s, Chinese government started to take diverse \n\nand flexible methods in economic aid and technical assistance etc. As referred above, \n\nin 1995 reforms on foreign aid were launched, and the main points were: initiation of \n\nproviding concessional loans, emphasis of assistance on productive projects, and \n\ncombination of national treasury, bank funds and aid flows from enterprises, in terms \n\nof resources. Reduction or relief of former debts became a new measure in the second \n\n\n\n\t 23\t\n\nphase. Meanwhile, projects on human resource development cooperation and \n\nhumanitarian aid have been growing by a high speed.  \n\n2.3 Summary of Chinese foreign aid flow to Africa \n\n    Without any doubt, Africa is the main destination of Chinese foreign aid flow. \n\nCalculated by statistics of China\u2019s White Paper on Foreign Aid 2011 and 2014, \n\n(Information Office of the State Council, People\u2019s Republic of China, 2011 and 2014), \n\nuntil the end of 2012, Africa occupied the 47.28% of total assistance with about 163.4 \n\nbillion RMB. The chart below shows the geographical distribution of Chinese aid \n\nflows, classified by different continents. \n\nFigure 2 Geographical Distribution of Chinese Foreign Aid (until the end of 2012) \n\nSource: Author\u2019s own calculation based on China\u2019s White Paper on Foreign Aid (2011 and 2014) \n\n \n\n    Owing to the inconsistency on definition and calculation, the statistics provided \n\nby China\u2019s official website and publications may be controversial. The statistics of \n\nChinese official assistance are extracted from Global Chinese Official Finance \n\nDataset Version 1.0. This database collected all the Chinese aid flows from 2000 to \n\n2014. By using AidData\u2019s Tracking Underreported Financial Flows (TUFF) \n\nMethodology developed by Strange et. al (2017), data\u2019s quality can be assured.  \n\nConsulting the Global Chinese Official Finance Dataset, the profile of China\u2019s \n\ndevelopment aid to Africa can be summarized as below. Since among all the projects \n\nAfrica, 47.28% \n\nAsia, 32.21% \n\nLatin America \nand the \n\nCaribbean, \n11.59% \n\nOceania, 4.05% \nEurope, 0.66% Others, \n\n4.22% Africa \n\nAsia \n\nLatin America and the \nCaribbean \n\nOceania \n\nEurope \n\nOthers \n\n\n\n\t 24\t\n\ncategorized by development intent, some flows are not recognized as ODA, based on \n\nthe standards of official development aid defined by OECD (OECD, 2018). In view of \n\nthe prudence and authenticity principles, data utilized by this paper are clearly defined \n\nby ODA-like by the database. After filtering out other projects not in accordance with \n\ndefinition, and remaining ones under \u201cdevelopment\u201d category and aid flows \n\ncategorized as ODA-like, the number of development projects reached 4816, oriented \n\nto 52 African countries with total amount of 682.043 billion USD (estimated by USD \n\nvalue of 2014). The charts below show the sectorial distribution of aid based on \n\nproject number and aid amount. Apart from the unallocated/ unspecified projects, in \n\nterms of sectorial distribution of foreign aid flows, most projects were allocated in \n\nsocial sectors, including areas of health (15%), education (12%), government and \n\ncivil society (10%) etc. The economic sectors held a large proportion of the total \n\nassistance amount. The transport and storage sector took the first place with 25% of \n\ntotal flow, reaching 170.15 billion USD. The energy generation and supply took the \n\nsecond position with 17% of total amount and value of 116.22 billion USD. Ethiopia \n\nreceived the most amount of aid with 13.23 billion USD. Mali and Angola were at the \n\nsecond and third place, with 11.137 billion and 9.424 billion USD. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3 Sectional Distribution of Aid Flows Based on Project Number \n \n\n\n\n\t 25\t\n\nSource: Author\u2019s own calculation based on AidData's Global Chinese Official Finance Dataset Version \n1.0 (2017). \n\n \n \nFigure 4 Sectional Distribution of Aid Flows Based on Aid Amount \n\nSource: Author\u2019s own calculation based on AidData's Global Chinese Official Finance Dataset Version \n1.0 (2017). \n\n \n\n15% \n\n12% \n\n10% \n\n9% \n9% \n\n8% \n\n6% \n\n6% \n\n5% \n\n4% \n\n4% \n3% \n\n2% \n\n1% \n1% \n\n1% \n1% 1% \n\n0% \n0% 0% 0% \n\n0% 0% \n\nHealth \n\nEducation \n\nGovernment and Civil Society \n\nUnallocated / Unspecified \n\nTransport and Storage \n\nEmergency Response \n\nOther Multisector \n\nEnergy Generation and \nSupply \n\nAgriculture, Forestry and \nFishing \n\nOther Social infrastructure \nand services \n\nIndustry, Mining, \nConstruction \n\n25% \n\n21% \n\n17% \n\n10% \n\n10% \n\n5% \n\n2% \n2% \n\n1% \n\n1% \n1% \n\n1% \n1% \n\n1% \n1% \n\n1% 0% 0% \n\n0% \n\n0% 0% 0% \n\n0% 0% \n\nEnergy Generation and Supply \n\nOther Multisector \n\nTransport and Storage \n\nUnallocated / Unspecified \n\nIndustry, Mining, Construction \n\nCommunications \n\nAction Relating to Debt \n\nOther Social infrastructure and \nservices \n\nBanking and Financial Services \n\nAgriculture, Forestry and \nFishing \n\nBusiness and Other Services \n\n\n\n\t 26\t\n\nChapter III Case Study \n\n    Taking into account the long history of Sino-African relationship on foreign \n\nassistance and important role played by African countries, it\u2019s reasonable to select \n\nAfrican recipients as object of investigate. This paper chooses one specific aspect, the \n\nstatus of oil resources, to test if Chinese ODA is stimulated by commercial interest on \n\nthis energy source. This chapter will depict the methodology, data, indicators, and \n\nobjects of study. Then it will manifest the whole process of study and in the end reach \n\nto the test result. \n\n3.1 Methodology of study \n\nThis work uses quantitative research method. In order to test the commercial \n\nmotive of Chinese official aid on energy resources, I execute the analysis based on the \n\ndata of petroleum imports from African countries and the Chinese official \n\ndevelopment aid given to respective countries. Aiming to examine if a linear \n\nrelationship exists between Chinese ODA and crude petroleum imports value, the \n\npaper uses bivariate correlation analysis. If the linear relationship exists indeed \n\nbetween ODA and crude petroleum imports, the linear regression analysis will be \n\nexecuted to find out if Chinese ODA flows change depending on the status of crude \n\npetroleum imports. \n\nThe indictors are selected owing to the reasons below. First of all, natural \n\nresources are always the point of discussion and critics by scholars and specialists. \n\nThe relationship between indicators such as import value and percentage of natural \n\nresources from recipients and the ODA amount implies the significance represented \n\nby commercial interest of donor in this area. And among all the natural resources, \n\npetroleum is more essential for economic activities. Therefore the result of correlation \n\nis representative to explain the principle motives of aid donors.  \n\nIn case of China, the cooperation on oil resources between China and African \n\ncountries has a long history. The Sino-African petroleum business initiated from \n\n\n\n\t 27\t\n\n1990s. After the First Ministerial Conference of FOCAC in 2000, the petroleum \n\ncommerce was promoted a lot. From 1993 when China became the importer of \n\npetroleum, the oil dependency has been increasing year by year, from 7.6% in 1995 to \n\n67.4% in 2017 (Yao, 2006; Hou, 2018). Meanwhile, Africa has been getting an \n\nincreasing strategic position in petroleum area with its gigantic oil reserves and \n\nproduction. According to data of OEC, the crude petroleum imported from Africa in \n\n2016 accounted for 19% of total crude petroleum, taking the second position among \n\nall continents.  \n\nOn the other hand, the petroleum resource is also vital to Africa. Africa has a \n\nbrilliant prospect of petroleum exploitation. The proved reserves increase steadily, \n\nfrom 75.3 thousand million barrels in 1997 to 126.5 in 2017 and it makes Africa the \n\nthird biggest petroleum storage area, only after the Middle East and Central Asia. It is \n\nalso the fourth biggest oil-producing area. Many of the African countries are \n\npetroleum exporters and their national economy depends a lot on petroleum \n\nexportation. According to statistics of World Development Indicators (The World \n\nBank) from 1970 to 2016, the oil rents took more than 50 per cent of GDP to some \n\nAfrican oil exporter countries.  \n\nTherefore, it\u2019s reasonable to choose oil resources to find out the link between \n\nChinese official development aid and African oil-producing countries and to examine \n\nif oil is one of the motives, which stimulate Chinese foreign assistance. \n\n3.2 Data and objects of study \n\nAs referred, in order to analyze relationship between Chinese ODA and African \n\ncountries\u2019 petroleum resource status, this work chooses the following indicators: \n\nChinese official development aid value during 2000-2014, China's crude petroleum \n\nimports value from African oil-producing countries and percentage of China's crude \n\npetroleum imports out of its total imports during 2000-2014. The selected African \n\nrecipient countries are Nigeria, Republic of Congo, Sudan, Angola, Equatorial Guinea \n\nand Gabon.  \n\n\n\n\t 28\t\n\n3.2.1 Chinese official development aid data \n\nIn the perspective of Chinese ODA amount, the statistics comes from Global \n\nChinese Official Finance Dataset Version 1.0, collected and refined mainly by \n\nAidData. The dataset tracks the records of oversea Chinese official finance between \n\n2000-2014, capturing 4,373 records totaling 354.4 billion USD. The data include both \n\nofficial development aid and other official financing.  \n\nThe controversy of Chinese foreign aid amount has existed for a long time. Since \n\nChina doesn\u2019t participate in existing reporting systems, it\u2019s difficult to collect \n\nexhaustive and accurate information about Chinese aid projects and total amount, \n\nwithout a wildly acceptable method of classification and calculation. Therefore, the \n\nGlobal Chinese Official Finance Dataset is a good choice. By using an open source \n\ndata collection methodology -- called Tracking Underreported Financial Flows (TUFF) \n\n(Strange, et al, 2017), the database classified the aid flows into different types, \n\naccording to their nature and characteristics.  \n\nThe methodology TUFF consists of three steps: project identification, source \n\ntriangulation and quality control. Projects were searched and collected mainly from \n\nfour resources: recipient countries\u2019 aid information management systems (AIMS); \n\nChinese official websites; IMF staff reports; and Factiva database. The accuracy of \n\nthose projects, along with the other details were uncovered and confirmed by \n\nsearching the individual records by local and global search engines in the second step. \n\nIn order to identify and solve potential pitfalls of open source information, in the third \n\nstep, all the record went through Record-by-Record Review, Targeted Review, \n\nDeflation &amp; Financial Review and Extended Review, so that potential errors, missing \n\ndata, or incorrect categorizations can be identified and cancelled.  \n\nConsidering China\u2019s special situation, the database enlarged the scope of official \n\nassistance to flows from institutions and entities including: government agencies \n\n(ministries and Chinese embassies); provincial governments; policy banks (China \n\nDevelopment Bank and China Export-import Bank)?state-owned commercial banks \n\n(the Bank of China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural \n\n\n\n\t 29\t\n\nBank of China, and the Construction Bank of China); and state-owned companies. \n\nThis paper uses only records defined as ODA-like flow, which means they have \n\ndevelopment intent and grant elements of each item can be measured and satisfy the \n\ndefinition of ODA flow.  \n\n3.2.2 China\u2019s petroleum imports data \n\nThe data of China\u2019s petroleum imports comes from OEC (The Observatory of \n\nEconomic Complexity) and its source is BACI - International Trade Database at the \n\nProduct-Level, which covers more than 200 countries and 5,000 products. It \n\nreconciles data reported to the United Nations Statistics Division, collated via \n\nCOMTRADE, following a specific methodology. Since in general, import values are \n\nreported CIF and exports FOB. In order to collate two different figures of the same \n\nflow to single one, a gravity-type equation is used to estimate CIF rates, which are \n\nremoved while processing data. The import values and export values are therefore \n\nmore reliable and single to facilitate the analysis (Gaulier et al, 2010).  \n\n From all indexes, the study utilizes China's crude petroleum imports value from \n\npetroleum producer and percentage of China's crude petroleum imports out of China's \n\ntotal imports to process the correlation. These two indexes show directly the \n\nimportance of recipients to China in terms of petroleum.  \n\n3.2.3 Object countries of study \n\nAccording to statistics of OEC, there\u2019s petroleum\u2019s imports information of China \n\nfrom 15 African oil-producing countries and some of the records are incomplete, \n\nbecause the oil trading history between those countries and China is quite short, like \n\nGhana, Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan. After filtering and \n\nexcluding countries with absent information, there are 6 final objects, namely Nigeria, \n\nRepublic of Congo, Sudan, Angola, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. Since Global \n\nChinese Official Finance Dataset covers only the Chinese ODA amount from 2000 to \n\n2014, the study therefore utilizes statistics of those 6 African countries, including \n\n\n\n\t 30\t\n\npetroleum import indicators and ODA flows of China, from 2000 to 2014 with 270 \n\nobservations.  \n\n3.3 Data analysis \n\nOn account of methodology, indicators, objects presented above, the statistics of \n\neach country are collated and shown in the table attached in appendix. The following \n\nfigures are elaborated based on it, from which we can have a brief view of trends of \n\neach indicator and the relationship between ODA and crude petroleum imports \n\ncondition. \n\n \nFigure 5 Nigeria: ODA-Like Flow From China And China\u2019s Crude Petroleum Imports \nData \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\nSource: Author\u2019s own elaboration based on data of AidData's Global Chinese Official Finance Dataset \nVersion 1.0 (2017) and OEC Database \n\t\n \n \n \nFigure 6 The Republic of Congo: ODA-Like Flow From China And China\u2019s Crude \nPetroleum Imports Data \n \n \n\n0.00% \n0.20% \n0.40% \n0.60% \n0.80% \n1.00% \n1.20% \n1.40% \n1.60% \n1.80% \n2.00% \n\n0  \n\n200  \n\n400  \n\n600  \n\n800  \n\n1,000  \n\n1,200  \n\n1,400  \n\n1,600  \n\n2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 \n\nNigeria ODA-like flow \n(millions usd_defl_2014) \n\nNigeria China's crude \npetroleum imports value \n(millions usd) \n\nNigeria China's crude \npetroleum imports (% of \nChina's total imports) \n\n\n\n\t 31\t\n\nSource: Author\u2019s own elaboration based on data of AidData's Global Chinese Official Finance Dataset \nVersion 1.0 (2017) and OEC Database. \n\t\n\t\nFigure 7 Sudan: ODA-Like Flow From China And China\u2019s Crude Petroleum Imports \nData \n\nSource: Author\u2019s own elaboration based on data of AidData's Global Chinese Official Finance Dataset \nVersion 1.0 (2017) and OEC Database. \n\n\t\n\t\nFigure 8 Angola: ODA-Like Flow From China And China\u2019s Crude Petroleum Imports \nData \n\n0.00% \n0.50% \n1.00% \n1.50% \n2.00% \n2.50% \n3.00% \n3.50% \n4.00% \n4.50% \n\n0  \n\n1,000  \n\n2,000  \n\n3,000  \n\n4,000  \n\n5,000  \n\n6,000  \n\n2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 \n\nODA-like flow \n(millions \nusd_defl_2014) \n\nChina's crude \npetroleum imports \nvalue (millions usd) \n\nChina's crude \npetroleum imports (% \nof China's total \nimports) \n\n0.00% \n\n1.00% \n\n2.00% \n\n3.00% \n\n4.00% \n\n5.00% \n\n6.00% \n\n7.00% \n\n8.00% \n\n9.00% \n\n0  \n\n1,000  \n\n2,000  \n\n3,000  \n\n4,000  \n\n5,000  \n\n6,000  \n\n7,000  \n\n8,000  \n\n2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 \n\nODA-like flow (millions \nusd_defl_2014) \n\nChina's crude petroleum \nimports value (millions \nusd) \n\nChina's crude petroleum \nimports (% of China's \ntotal imports) \n\n0% \n\n2% \n\n4% \n\n6% \n\n8% \n\n10% \n\n12% \n\n14% \n\n16% \n\n18% \n\n0  \n\n5,000  \n\n10,000  \n\n15,000  \n\n20,000  \n\n25,000  \n\n30,000  \n\n35,000  \n\n2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 \n\nODA-like flow (millions \nusd_defl_2014) \n\nChina's crude petroleum \nimports value (millions \nusd) \n\nChina's crude petroleum \nimports (% of China's \ntotal imports) \n\n\n\n\t 32\t\n\n0.00% \n\n0.50% \n\n1.00% \n\n1.50% \n\n2.00% \n\n2.50% \n\n3.00% \n\n3.50% \n\n4.00% \n\n0  \n\n500  \n\n1,000  \n\n1,500  \n\n2,000  \n\n2,500  \n\n2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 \n\nODA-like flow (millions \nusd_defl_2014) \n\nChina's crude petroleum \nimports value (millions \nusd) \n\nChina's crude petroleum \nimports (% of China's \ntotal imports) \n\n0.00% \n\n0.10% \n\n0.20% \n\n0.30% \n\n0.40% \n\n0.50% \n\n0.60% \n\n0.70% \n\n0  \n\n200  \n\n400  \n\n600  \n\n800  \n\n1,000  \n\n1,200  \n\n2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 \n\nODA-like flow \n(millions \nusd_defl_2014) \n\nChina's crude \npetroleum imports \nvalue (millions usd) \n\nChina's crude \npetroleum imports (% \nof China's total \nimports) \n\nSource: Author\u2019s own elaboration based on data of AidData's Global Chinese Official Finance Dataset \nVersion 1.0 (2017) and OEC Database. \n\n\t\n\t\nFigure 9\t Equatorial Guinea: ODA-Like Flow From China And China\u2019s Crude \nPetroleum Imports Data \n\t\n\t\n\t\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \nSource: Author\u2019s own elaboration based on data of AidData's Global Chinese Official Finance Dataset \nVersion 1.0 (2017) and OEC Database. \n\n \nFigure 10 Gabon: ODA-Like Flow From China And China\u2019s Crude Petroleum \nImports Data \n\nSource: Author\u2019s own elaboration based on data of AidData's Global Chinese Official Finance Dataset \nVersion 1.0 (2017) and OEC Database. \n\n \n\nBased on the line charts above, we can find that generally speaking, the crude \n\npetroleum imports amount increased a lot during the 14 years.

Therefore, we can conclude from the correlation \n\ntests that, no relationship between ODA and crude petroleum imports is approved. \n\nBased on this result, it isn\u2019t even necessary to process the next step to explore if the \n\ntrend of ODA depends on the increase or decrease of petroleum imports from African \n\nrecipient countries. The result is consistent with the study of Dreher and Fuchs (2015). \n\n\n\n\t 37\t\n\nThe Dreher and Fuchs\u2019s paper shows that China doesn\u2019t provide, significantly more \n\naid to countries that are abundant of natural resources, including fuel, ore and \n\nagricultural resources. This work analyzes only the petroleum\u2019s impact to Chinese \n\nODA flows. Similarly, the results show no evidence that Chinese development \n\nassistance prefers African recipients with the abundance of oil resource. No obvious \n\nlink is proved between Chinese ODA and African oil-producing countries. \n\t\n\n \n\nConclusion \n\nThe fourth High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Busan pointed out \u201cwe are \n\nunited by a new partnership that is more broader and more inclusive than ever \n\nbefore\u201d(OECD, 2011). The South-South cooperation has aroused a wide concern. \n\nOwing to the difference in nature, modalities and responsibilities applied by \n\nSouth-South cooperation with the traditional ones, the new participants\u2019 performance \n\nhas been widely recognized. The aids\u2019 effectiveness and motives are challenged and \n\nsome scholars and journalists claimed that the assistance of emerging donors is rogue \n\nbecause the aid flows are mainly stimulated and guided by self-interests and strategy \n\nof donors instead of real demands of recipients. However, many studies reveal \n\ndiversified principle motives with regard to these emerging donors and that they \n\ncannot be considered as \u201crogue\u201d. Taking into account this controversy, this work \n\nchooses China, one of representatives of emerging donors, as the study object. It uses \n\nthe data of China\u2019s ODA and of petroleum commerce between China and its African \n\nrecipients, aiming to find out if oil resources condition of recipient countries can be \n\nconsidered as a principle motive of Chinese official development aid.  \n\nChina initiated its foreign assistance from the beginning of 1950s. With reform \n\nand development during its history, it broadened the cooperation areas, diversified \n\nmodalities and aid channels. The recipients\u2019 number expanded during the recent 60 \n\nyears. Among them, African countries take a huge part. With seven Ministerial \n\n\n\n\t 38\t\n\nConferences of Forum on China-Africa Cooperation held among China and African \n\ncountries, the cooperation deepened and the scale enlarged. Also according to the \n\nChina\u2019s White Paper on Foreign Aid (2011 and 2014), until 2012, Africa received \n\n47.28% of China\u2019s total aid. Meanwhile, Africa has an increasing abundance in oil \n\nresources. Taking into account the proximity in various areas, it\u2019s reasonable to \n\nchoose statistics between China and African recipients to do the test.  \n\n    This work utilizes the crude petroleum imports value from African oil-producing \n\ncountries and its relative importance in total China\u2019s imports of oil as a proxy of \n\nChina\u2019s commercial motive in aiding Africa. It also uses the bilateral flow of Chinese \n\naid to those specific African countries. The data comes from OEC and Aiddata sets. \n\nComparing the tendency of ODA and petroleum imports data, we\u2019ll find whether they \n\ndisplay a consistency in trends. A second step is however necessary. In order to test \n\nthe correlation between China\u2019s oil imports and its bilateral flow of aid to those \n\nspecific African countries, we apply a regression analysis. By processing first \n\nbivariate correlation and regression analysis, the test results show no obvious \n\nrelationship between Chinese official development assistance and the petroleum \n\nimports data. This means the oil resources cannot be considered as a significant \n\nmotive that help the African oil-producing countries attract aid flows. Hence, some \n\narguments that blame the oil resources purpose of Chinese ODA may not be \n\nreasonable. \n\nOwing to the difference in various areas with the traditional donors\u2019 assistance, \n\nit\u2019s understandable that the emerging donors cause the query, doubt, criticism and \n\nother negative voice. The new participants have indeed many defects like the \n\ninsufficiency of assistance techniques, non-transparency that expands the distance \n\nbetween the aid flows of emerging donors and the public, and these problems need to \n\nbe solved gradually. However, I believe that, giving the patience and encouragement, \n\nthe South-South cooperation will realize the self-improvement along with its \n\ndevelopment and its performance will get better and better. \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t 39\t\n\n \n\nReferences \n\n1.
