This paper assesses how the results \nof e-gov in the states of the federation are affected by the \ninstitutional design of e-gov policies.\n\nThe term e-gov refers normally to the use of ICT to \nprovide services to the citizen, to the review and integra-\ntion of processes, to improve the efficiency and efficacy of \npublic administration, and to the creation of mechanisms \nof digital relations with the citizen. Although e-gov repre-\nsents a scenario of possibilities for public management, a \ngreat part of theoretical and practical discussions on the \nbenefits and potentialities of e-gov are based on a logic of \nwill that keeps a certain technological imperative. What \nwe notice as it is performed is that, in various situations, \nthe effects on the use of ICT are complex and generate \nunpredictable results. Thus, we believe the study of the \nimplementation of technology, including e-gov, should \nnot restrict its technical components. For instance: one \ncan seek understanding of institutional factors affecting \ntechnological management processes (as in this paper, for \ninstance). The institutions give shape to the process of \nICT use and end up catalyzing or moderating the imple-\nmentation of e-gov. This premise guided the choice of \ninstitutionalism in its rational choice line, as a conceptual \nmodel for our investigation. The research question is: How \nis the institutionalization of Brazilian e-gov? Our aim is \nto understand the institutional design of e-gov and ICT \nin our state governments and how these arrangements \naffect the gains associated with e-gov.\n\nTo observe e-gov under an institutionalist scope has \nthe potential of helping understand the institutional ar-\nrangement e-gov assumed and the influence of this design \nin the use and results of e-gov initiatives. In the past few \nyears, several studies examined innovation, development \nand implementation of ICT from an institutional perspec-\ntive (MIGNERAT and RIVARD, 2005; FOUNTAIN, 2005; \nAVGEROU, 2000). Yet, in the context of ICT in govern-\nment, especially in the largest country in Latin America, \nthese studies are in a very small number. We believe this \nis a contribution for that work, since approaches such \nas institutionalism, unusual in the field of Information \nSystems in Brazil, make it possible to create a solid frame-\nwork for the studies of governmental ICT policies. From \nan empirical point of view, this research contributed for \nthat practice, pointing out the arrangements by means of \nwhich e-gov has been implemented in Brazilian states, \n\nclarifying the challenges for the creation of a state agenda. \nOne of the most important consequences in the process of \ndecentralization and democratization of political power \nin Brazil (from the 1980s) was the growth of the impor-\ntance of subnational governments, be them state or city \nones. However, academic literature on public management \npolicies for state governments is still scarce (ABRUCIO, \n2004). This is another contribution we believe we are giv-\ning to conclude this research: a deep study on ICT usage \npolicies in the state sphere.\n\nSTATE rEform AND THE uSE of ICT IN BrAZILIAN \nGoVErNmENTS\n\nIn the 1970s, mostly after the oil shock in 1973, the \nperiod Hobsbawm (1995) called \u201cFordist Golden Age\u201d \nstarted showing signs of collapse. A crisis was beginning \nin three fundamental dimensions: economical, social and \nof the State apparatus.\n\nGiven the crisis context, the State Reform projects were \nprioritized. For public administration, some lines of action \nbecame compulsory, such as: expense reduction, State ap-\nparatus efficiency increase, a need for greater agility and \nflexibility of the governmental apparatus to respond to \nexternal environment demands, more unstable and dy-\nnamic (BRASIL, 1995). Thatcher and Reagan governments \nrepresented a source of a new agenda internationally called \n\u201cNew Public Management\u201d (NPM) which influenced the \nrenovation movements in the 1990s in many countries.\n\n Abrucio (1997) traces some marks of development \nin the processes of State Reform. For that author, they \nstarted as pure managing. They focused on the most ur-\ngent needs of changes in nations in the 1970s and 1980s \n\u2013 resources were scarce. Seeking to solve this, govern-\nments started adopting budget planning and cost control. \nA second tendency of State Reform movements, after \nmanaging, is consumerism. Attention was then focused \non clients/consumers and included the administration \npatterns from private organizations applied to public \nones. Despite their development, renovation movements \nstarted being criticized for their excessive inclusion of \nprivate administration in public administration agenda. \nAs Mintzberg (1996) points out, citizens have rights \nthat differ from the goods, products and services cli-\nents purchase. Therefore, certain British authors started \ndiscussing Public Service Orientation (PSO) aiming to \nintroduce their accountability concepts \u2013 transparency, \npolitical participation, and equity (HEEKS, 1998) \u2013 in \nthe State Reform agenda.\n\n\n\nmArCoNI mArTINS DE LAIA \u2022 mArIA ALEXANDrA VIEGAS CorTEZ DA CuNHA \u2022 ANToNIo roBErTo rAmoS NoGuEIrA \u2022 JoS\u00e9 AfoNSo mAZZoN\n\nISSN 0034-7590 \u00a9RAE  \u2022  S\u00e3o Paulo  \u2022  v. 51  \u2022  n. 1  \u2022  jan./fev. 2011  \u2022  043-057  \u2022  45\n\n The processes of State Reform are seen as a condition \nto enhance governance in public management, which \nis \u201cthe capacity of the State to efficiently and effectively \ntransform the decisions they make into reality\u201d (BRESSER \nPEREIRA, 1998, p. 109). Through governance, the State \n\u201cseeks to deepen the democratic mechanisms of rendering \nthe government responsible and transparent\u201d (BRESSER \nPEREIRA, 1998, p. 109). Thus, the State Reform move-\nments brought up the discussion on the need for a more \neffective public administration based in solid governance \nprinciples, focused on the operational capacity of public \nadministration and in the capacity of opening of the par-\nticipation channels for the citizens to elaborate, follow \nup and assess public policies. In practice, they prioritize \npublic policies affecting areas such as planning, bud-\nget, organizational structure, human resources, process \nmanagement, governmental purchases, and information \ntechnologies (BARZELAY, 2001). According to Gaetani \n(2005), technically speaking, the use of technological in-\nnovations is an important factor for the modernization of \npublic administration and e-gov can be understood as one \nof the most significant reforming initiatives of Brazilian \npublic management.\n\n The genesis of ICT use in Brazilian public administra-\ntion lays in the initiatives by state ICT companies since \nthe 1960s and state computing councils since the 1970s. \nThose two structures, albeit named differently back then, \nremain up to the present. Throughout the 1980s and \n1990s, the states started adopting structures of comput-\ning planning and coordination. However, their initiatives \nwere fragile, detached from the government\u2019s plans and \npublic policies (CHAHIN and others, 2004). In the 2000s, \nsome states and cities tried new public computing orga-\nnization models and developed projects for the improve-\nment in services provided for the citizen, using ICT and \ne-democracy, understood here as the use of ICT in ampli-\nfying the practice of democracy and in the management of \npublic policies. Specifically in public policies of govern-\nmental management, Brazil faces great challenges, such \nas the labor relations in the ambit of public power; the \ndefinition of organizational architecture; the processes of \nbudget planning and execution; the control mechanisms \nand the public expenses audit; and the rules for bidding \nand for hiring goods and services. In order to face these \nchallenges, ICT has been used to support of people and \ncompetences management; to obtain information and \nindicators for making decisions; in the management of \nprojects and goals; in the integration of planning systems; \nin the expenses follow-up; in the budget management; in \nthe implementation of management information systems; \n\nand in systems allowing transparency of public expenses \n(GAETANI, 2005).\n\n Brazilian academic literature, in the past decade, in-\ncludes researches on various aspects of e-gov or electronic \ngovernance, such as Akutsu and Pinho (2002); Ruediger \n(2002); Ramos and Ramos (2003); Frey (2003); Fernandes \n(2007); Knight, Fernandes and Cunha (2007); Pinho \n(2008); Diniz and others (2009); Cunha and Pozzebon \n(2009). There are researches related with ICT strategies \nand management models for the public sector, implemen-\ntation of information systems, follow-up and assessment \nof public policies, social projects and programs, and digital \ninclusion, in addition to reports on specific aspects such \nas e-services and e-commerce.\n\nThe technological development has allowed the growth \nin electronic services, the opening of communication \nchannels with society, and the disclosure of public admin-\nistration initiatives. Despite the advances in ICT and the \nstudies on e-gov in the context of Brazil, we believe it is \nimportant to dwell on institutional arrangements of e-gov \nand ICT, as the use of information technologies does not \nbring about the same effects in all contexts.\n\nCoNCEPTuAL moDEL \u2014 E-GoV PoLICIES AND \nINSTITuTIoNALISm\n\n \nA large part of the discussions and researches on e-gov \nand technology are based on an idea that the application \nof ICT and the organizational transformation keep cause \nand effect relations (AVGEROU, 2000). On this subject, \nFountain (2005) highlights that, in such reports, ICT \nleads to a series or predictable changes and to greater \norganizational effectiveness. The idea that the initiatives \nof the agents are rational and maximize efficiency and ef-\nficacy is a commonly accepted assumption in researches \non ICT (AVGEROU, 2000). Nevertheless, according to \nthat author, such causality is not so simple to be observed \nand the studies on information technology need to focus \non the institutional context where decisions are made. \nThus, the neo-institutional analysis has the potential to \nhelp understand the means by which institutions influ-\nence the design, use and consequences of technology in \norganizations.\n\n Therefore, we built a conceptual model anchored in \nneo-institutionalism of rational choice aiming to study \ne-gov policies of the states in the Brazilian federation.\n\n Institutions can be understood as symbolic systems \ncomprised of regulating, normative, and cultural/cognitive \nelements that produce stability and meaning in a given \n\n\n\n46  \u2022  \u00a9RAE  \u2022  S\u00e3o Paulo  \u2022  v. 51  \u2022  n. 1  \u2022  jan./fev. 2011  \u2022  043-057 ISSN 0034-7590\n\nforum \u2022 ELECTroNIC GoVErNmENT PoLICIES IN BrAZIL: CoNTEXT, ICT mANAGEmENT AND ouTComES\n\nsocial context as it determines the rules of the game to be \nobserved by a group of actors. They are comprised of rules \nand norms that establish behavioral patterns of the actors \nand manipulate a series of sanctions \u2013 rewards and pun-\nishments \u2013 aiming to influence the agents\u2019 behavior in a \npolitical game (HALL and TAYLOR, 1996; SCOTT, 2001).\n\n Scott (2001) offers and interesting analytical cut to \nfacilitate the use of institutional theory in organizational \nanalysis. In his view, institutionalist studies can be di-\nvided in two foci: the first is based on regulating and \nnormative aspects, following the rules of the game in an \norganizational context and enforcement mechanisms. \nIt corresponds to the instrumental tradition of the new \ninstitutionalism represented by the economical lines and \nrational choice (HALL and TAYLOR, 1996). Theoreticians \nin this approach assume that individuals seek to know the \nrules of the political game so as to maximize their benefits \nand minimize their costs. In this case, institutions describe \npossible alternatives for the actors. They also provide en-\nforcement mechanisms and information that reduce the \nuncertainty regarding the behaviors of others. The authors \nwho adopt this approach assume that individuals seek \nto get to know the rules of the political game, from the \npermitted and forbidden movements to the penalties for \nthose who infringe them, so as to maximize their payoffs.\n\n Scott (2001) mentions another group of institutional \nstudies based on a cultural/cognitive or sociological line. \nThey emphasize the extent to which the interpretation the \nactors give for a situation determines their choice. The \nconception of the institutions in this line points towards \ninformal norms, habits, symbols and conventions that \nstructure and shape up individuals\u2019 behavior.\n\n According to Immergut (2006), neo-institutionalist \nanalysis shows that preferences and decisions are prod-\nucts of the institutions and help analyze the reasons that \nlead the actors from a given context to choose a certain \ndefinition of interests and not another equally plausible \none. For Goodin (1996), the institutions bring about the \nexistence of designs or arrangements that promote a group \nof results. He states that institutional designs can be un-\nderstood as the creation of an active format that causes \nresults in a given context.\n\nAs previously mentioned, this paper uses the ap-\nproach of rational choice to study e-gov policies designs \nin the states of the Brazilian federation. Thus, we study \ne-gov policies in an institution responsible for providing \nregulating and normative elements that will foment the \ncreation of an institutional design capable of producing \na group of e-gov results (OFFE, 1996). We state, then, \nthat in an institutionalized e-gov policy, social structures \n\nand mechanisms were created determining the arrange-\nments of state e-gov and structuring ICT management. \nTherefore, it works as a strong government element guid-\ning the actors\u2019 course of action. On the other hand, if it is \nfragile, it will be subdued by other institutions working \non state governments.\n\nFigure 1 presents a model we built to observe the in-\nstitutional design of e-gov policies.\n\nThe arrangement is formed by the conjugation of \nthe institutional context (1) and the technical one (2). \nAccording to Scott and Meyer (1991), these two should \nnot exclude each other, as each one of them produces \norganizational responses based on rationality. To con-\nsider the institutional context is important for Brazilian \ne-gov, as governments are inserted in an environment \nstrongly marked by both formal and informal laws, rules \nand norms. Since the 1990s, there have been important \nattempts of administrative reforms in Brazil with new \nmanagement tools. On the other hand, e-gov depends on \nICT technical advances, which is marked by innovations, \nboth in management associated with technology and in \nthe technological development itself, as can be noted in \nthe recent use of the web 2.0 tools.\n\n Returning to Figure 1, the conjunction of institutional \n(1) and technical (2) elements form the institutional de-\nsign (3) of e-gov initiatives in Brazil. This design affects \nhow technology is managed (4). The elements consid-\nered in the technology management part (4) were chosen \nfrom a view presented by Weill and Ross (2006) on ICT \ngovernance. The \u201ctechnology management\u201d component \nwas described so as to observe: i) how states create gov-\nernance systems to manage e-gov with the definition of \nroles, duties and responsibilities of various agencies that \ncomprise the public administration structure; ii) how they \nmanage and prioritize ICT budget, which is important, \nas institutions influence how resources are allocated, de-\nfining the \u201crules of the game\u201d in this allocation (SCOTT \nand MEYER, 1991); iii) the data administration archi-\ntecture corresponding to the mapping of databases, to \nstandardization of data elements and data modeling in \npublic administration; iv) the management of the ICT \ninfrastructure; v) and the identification of the prioriti-\nzation of the applications. E-gov initiatives demand the \nconstruction of applications used to provide services to \nthe citizen. Institutionalized e-gov policies define patterns \nand procedures for the development of governmental ap-\nplications, in addition to presenting software products as \na result, allowing, for instance, an enhancement in the \noffer of governmental services.\n\n A fundamental element in Figure 1 is the understand-\n\n\n\nmArCoNI mArTINS DE LAIA \u2022 mArIA ALEXANDrA VIEGAS CorTEZ DA CuNHA \u2022 ANToNIo roBErTo rAmoS NoGuEIrA \u2022 JoS\u00e9 AfoNSo mAZZoN\n\nISSN 0034-7590 \u00a9RAE  \u2022  S\u00e3o Paulo  \u2022  v. 51  \u2022  n. 1  \u2022  jan./fev. 2011  \u2022  043-057  \u2022  47\n\ning of enforcement mechanisms generated by e-gov poli-\ncies. An institution can only be considered as such from \nthe moment when there are mechanisms to guarantee its \nimposition. The sanction character of an institution would \nonly be unnecessary in an environment where rewards \nhave such advantages that all parts would perform their \npre-established roles. This is a rather unfeasible ideal con-\ndition. Apart from enforcement, we have also considered \nin the design what Goodin (1996) pointed as a defining \nfeature of the institutionalization process: its stable and \nrecurrent nature. Institutions can be defined as a process \nby which organizations and procedures obtain value and \nstability. Therefore, e-gov policies need to be legitimized \n(3) in order to affect ICT management and e-gov results.\n\nFinally, one will find e-gov results (6), which compre-\nhend e-services, information transparency, effectiveness of \ngovernmental initiatives, and participation of citizens in the \nelaboration, follow-up and assessment of public policies. \nThey also need enforcement mechanisms to come to exist.\n\nIn the following section we will discuss the develop-\nment of the study of e-gov policies institutionalization in \nstate governments.\n\nmETHoDoLoGY\n \n\nOur research perspective was inspired in texts and re-\nsearches by Walsham (1995), Pozzebon (2003) and \nBarbosa (2008). The epistemological position that guided \nthis paper is interpretativist. It starts from the assumption \nthat reality is socially construed by actors involved in it \nand, hence, it is impossible to completely separate facts \nfrom values, like in the positivist paradigm (WALSHAM, \n1995). The research issue \u2013 the object of analysis in this \npaper \u2013 is in the category called descriptive character re-\nsearch. The research instruments or techniques that were \nused focused on a qualitative approach, since they seek \nto \u201cdescribe, decode, translate and, on the other hand, \nto reach a conclusion regarding the meaning \u2013 not the \nfrequency \u2013 of certain phenomena of the social world\u201d \n(MAANEN, 1983). They are flexible and applied to small \nsample units. The central research approach is formed by \nthe study of multiple cases.\n\n E-gov policies were studied in the realm of Brazilian \nstate governments, which is justified by its relevance in \nthe federative scenario of Brazil and also because e-gov \n\nFigure 1 - Conceptual model for the analysis of e-gov policies\n\n4\n\n5\n\n1\n\n3\n2\n\n5\n\n6\n\n1) New management \ntools\n\n2) Internet, other \nmeans of digital \ntelecommunications, \nhardware, software,  \n\nE-gov technical \ncontext:\n\nInstitutional context: regulating and\nnormative elements\n\n1) New models of public management and state \nmodernization\n\n2) Governmental planning and formulation\n3) E-gov planning and formulation\n\nINSTITUTIONAL\nDESIGN\n\nLegitimacy: internal consistency\n\nEnforcement\n\nEnforcement\n\nRESULTS\n\nProvide\nservices\n\nTransparency Participation Effectiveness in public \npolicies management  \n\nICT management\n\nICT organization arrangements \nand structure\n\nGovernance systems: roles, \nduties, responsibilities\n\nICT prioritization and budget\nmanagement \n\nICT architecture\n\nICT infrastructure management\n\nApplications prioritization and\nidentification \n\n\n\n48  \u2022  \u00a9RAE  \u2022  S\u00e3o Paulo  \u2022  v. 51  \u2022  n. 1  \u2022  jan./fev. 2011  \u2022  043-057 ISSN 0034-7590\n\nforum \u2022 ELECTroNIC GoVErNmENT PoLICIES IN BrAZIL: CoNTEXT, ICT mANAGEmENT AND ouTComES\n\nis still and agenda in process of assimilation in the \npolicies of public state management (GAETANI, 2005; \nFERNANDES, 2007).

Pernambuco also joined the \ngroup, as its e-gov policy has been an object of studies \nand is referenced as a good model of e-gov development \n(FUNDAP, 2006).

Although \nthe state of Rio de Janeiro agreed to participate in our \nresearch, we were unable to get an interview booked.\n\nFrom the conceptual model (Figure 1), we estab-\nlished the analysis categories. In the treatment of the \ndata, the categorization strategy was important, as it \nallowed: (a) to group up elements, ideas and expres-\nsions around concepts able to synthesize the collection, \nanalysis and interpretation of the data; (b) to translate \nthe theoretical framework in analyzable items; and (c) \nto allow the construction of tools to collect data in a \nform coherent with the theoretical framework we ad-\nopted (MILES and HUBERMAN, 1994). The proposed \ncategories were: ICT and e-gov legislation; ICT and e-\ngov policies planning, formulation and integration; ICT \norganizational structure and arrangements: governance \nsystems, roles, duties, responsibilities; ICT prioritiza-\ntion and budget management; identification and pri-\noritization of applications; infrastructure management; \nInformation Technology architecture; enforcement. \nIn addition to these, we created categories regarding \n\u201cresults\u201d which were the services offered; transpar-\nency; participation; and effectiveness in public policies \nmanagement.

At first, people chosen to answer it \nwere: i) a high management state representative, sec-\nretary or undersecretary in coordination or planning \nareas; ii) the one responsible for e-gov state policies; \niii) the president of the company or agency responsible \nfor computing. After gathering the data, in December \n2009, 15 people had been interviewed in five states of \nthe federation: 3 state secretaries, 2 state undersecre-\ntaries or joint secretaries, 4 state computing structure \ndirector-presidents (from the company or agency), 2 \nother computing structure directors, 4 people respon-\nsible for e-gov policies in the government. The inter-\nviews were recorded and transcribed.\n\nThe data analysis was made using the NVivo soft-\nware and it followed the model by Miles and Huberman \n\n(1994) in which the analysis is carried out in four \nphases: a) data collection; b) data reduction; c) data \ntable or display; d) conclusion and checking. In the last \nphase, the researcher identifies regularities, patterns, \nexplanations and flows of cause and effect.\n\n To perform the reduction and the data table, we \nused a coding model creating free nodes, tree nodes and \ncase nodes from the texts of the interviews (BARBOSA, \n2008).\n\n Each free node crated received a code: [99]\u2013[yyyy]\u2013\n[99]\u2013[name of concept]. The first part [99] contained \na question number from the script. The second [yyyy], \nan abbreviation of the analysis category; for instance, \nthe code LEGINFO for ICT and e-gov legislation. \nThe third part of the code [99] is the sequence of free \nnodes created in each category. The fourth part [name \nof concept] contained the name of the free node. This \ndescription allowed the researchers to quickly link the \ntheoretical framework with the conceptual scheme dis-\nplayed in Figure 1.\n\n Once the free nodes were created, the data were re-\nduced by means of creating tree nodes. They result from \nthe hierarchical aggregation of the free nodes (figure 2). \nWith them, it is possible to establish more comprehen-\nsive concepts, capable of facilitating the analysis. Based \non the conceptual model, nine tree nodes were created: \na) data architecture and administration; b) institutional \ncontext; c) governmental planning and formulation; d) \ne-gov policies institutionalization challenges; e) organi-\nzational arrangements and structure; f) IT management; \ng) ICT management history; h) e-services providing; i) \ninformation access and transparency.\n\nFinally, case nodes were created aiming to express \nrelations among the tree nodes (BARBOSA, 2008). They \nwere named from the conceptual model and from the \nauthors\u2019 experience in the subject of e-gov. There are \nthree case nodes: 1) institutional context, formula-\ntion and governmental planning; 2) IT management; \n3) results.\n\nThe case node (1) institutional context, formulation \nand governmental planning arose from the aggregation \nof tree nodes (b) institutional context; (c) formulation \nand governmental planning; (d) e-gov policies institu-\ntionalization challenges; (g) ICT management history. \nThe case node (2) IT management was composed of \ntree nodes (a) data administration and architecture; \n(3) organizational structure and arrangements; (f) IT \nmanagement. At last, the case node (2) results was \ncomposed of the aggregation of the nodes (h) e-services \nand (i) information access and transparency.\n\n\n\nmArCoNI mArTINS DE LAIA \u2022 mArIA ALEXANDrA VIEGAS CorTEZ DA CuNHA \u2022 ANToNIo roBErTo rAmoS NoGuEIrA \u2022 JoS\u00e9 AfoNSo mAZZoN\n\nISSN 0034-7590 \u00a9RAE  \u2022  S\u00e3o Paulo  \u2022  v. 51  \u2022  n. 1  \u2022  jan./fev. 2011  \u2022  043-057  \u2022  49\n\nDATA ANALYSIS AND DISCuSSIoN\n \n\nFrom the first interactions with the material, 202 \nfree nodes emerged from the interviews.

ICT plan-\nning in state governments ends up blended in a series of \nsectored policies given the inexistence of e-gov policies \nformal planning (lines 2 and 3, Exhibit 1). Other elements \nreinforce the reality of a gap in e-gov planning and of the \nexistence of uncoordinated initiatives, most noticeably: \n(a) the inexistence of e-gov policy formalization \u2013 in-\ncluding PPA (line 3, Exhibit 1); (b) Absence of ICT use \ninstitutionalization (line 10, Exhibit 1); and (c) ICT use \nbased on the initiative of each secretarial or management \nsector (line 12).\n\nFor the interviewees there is no integrated view of ICT \npolicies in those states. One of them states:\n\nNo, there is no central planning. I mean, then, there is \n\nno IT strategic planning. What\u2019s there are a few practices, \n\ngood ones, not bad, but sporadic and performed by iso-\n\nlated individuals. A strategic IT guidance, for the state, \n\nfor instance, what are all the great databases of the state? \n\nHow can they be used? And so on. Throughout time, what \n\nworks should be prioritized? This will be up to each de-\n\npartment to propose to their system, their process, their \n\nproject and to obtain this approval. (Interviewee #15, \n\ninterview data.)\n\nAnother one states:\n\n(...) what is chosen as priority, is so done by a certain \n\nagency or department. It is not prioritized for the govern-\n\nment or for the citizen, that is my view. If there\u2019s money \n\nleft, great. all can be done. If there\u2019s no money left, each \n\nagency prioritizes itself. I think it\u2019s hard, but it has to be \n\nat least minimally done (...). As people themselves aren\u2019t \n\ncommitted to the state as a whole. They\u2019re more commit-\n\nted to their organization, the area they run. It\u2019s very hard \n\nto think state, very hard.

Maturity is associated with the intensity with \nwhich e-gov projects and initiatives bring about public ad-\nministration structure and processes transformation. As a \nresult, it depends on the government\u2019s capacity of sustain-\ning a transforming process, which relies on the alignment \namong strategies and public administration structures \nand e-gov program (FERNANDES, 2007). Furthermore, \nthe discussion of advanced patters of public management \nrelies on the assumption that there is a cooperation logic \namong agencies and entities, so that there\u2019s a more effec-\ntive global effect in providing public service (ABRUCIO, \n1997). Thus, the insularity of ICT policies shows an \ninstitutional pattern that does not generate enforcement \nconditions capable of promoting the integration of public \nstate administration agencies and entities.\n\nIn most cases, an isolated normative view prevails \ninstitutionally in each organization or government area \n\nperforming ICT implementations in a broader, yet dis-\nconnected way of technological policy, favoring cohe-\nsion in the use of ICT among governmental agencies. \nIntegrating potencies tend to be neutralized by effective \ninstitutional arrangements, since the design in vigor fa-\nvors the adoption of technology in a fragmented manner. \nThere are no enforcement rules or mechanisms to run \nICT initiatives harmoniously. It is a legitimate scenario \nfor the actors to run ICT initiatives, since, although \nthey highlight the need for integrated initiatives, there \nis nothing keeping e-gov initiatives to be run after an \nisolated fashion.\n\nAs indicated in line 3, Exhibit 1, there\u2019s no e-gov or \nICT policy. The common mentioning is the inexistence \nof strong policies. There are initiatives running in an \nisolated manner, but with no coordination or organicity. \nSo \u201cthe lack of policies leads to unfinished initiatives. It\u2019s \njust a collection of good intentions, isn\u2019t it?\u201d (Interviewee \n#11 \u2013 fragment from the interview.) In addition, the mere \nexistence of a written policy doesn\u2019t mean it is institu-\ntionalized and is no guarantee that e-gov coordinated \ninitiatives will be created. According to North (1990), \nindividuals act in a social context seeking to understand \n\nExhibit 2 \u2013 Partial presentation of the case node institutional context, formulation and governmental planning\n\nCASE NODE: INSTITUTIONAL CONTExT, FORMULATION AND GOVERNMENT PLANNING\n\nTREE NODES: INSTITUTIONAL CONTExT; FORMULATION AND GOVERNMENT PLANNING; E-GOV POLICIES INSTITUTIONALIzATION \nCHALLENGES; ICT MANAGEMENT HISTORy\n\nFREE NODES\nCODED \n\nINTERVIEwS\nCODED \n\nFRAGMENTS\n\n1 06) PLANTIC - 01 - Inexistence of integrated planning and state view as a whole 13 71\n\n2 06) PLANTIC \u2013 03 \u2013 Existence of sector planning 13 58\n\n3 06) PLANTIC \u2013 04 \u2013 inexistence of e-gov policies formalization \u2013 including PPA 9 58\n\n4 05) PLAN \u2013 02 \u2013 Structuring programs with resource priorities 8 21\n\n5\n04) PLANTIC \u2013 06 \u2013 E-gov evolution depends on changes on laws, decrees, structures (institutional \nchanges).

The aim is to maximize payoffs. \nThe various agencies and entities adopt technology in \na non-integrated manner and there are no constraints \ninterposed between actors and the consecution of their \npreferences (HALL and TAYLOR, 2003). There is no \ncost, not even political, in the uncoordinated running \nof ICT initiatives.\n\nThe behavior of agencies and entities in ICT in state \ngovernments is an optimal response to the institutional \ncontext found. The tendency, therefore, is to give con-\ntinuity to a scenario marked by fragmented initiatives, \neven if they present less-than-optimal collective results.\n\nIT management\nRegarding IT management, the nodes that emerged in \nthe analysis point towards the difficulty of establishing \ncriteria to guide the initiatives, indicated an incipient ICT \nmanagement environment (Exhibit 3).\n\nNotice that, in the chosen literature, ICT governance \nappears based on patterns that define mechanisms, for-\nmalizing relations and establishing rules and procedures \nto make sure that organizational aims are met (WEILL \nand ROSS, 2006). Exhibit 3 shows an environment of \nlack of formal processes to guide and direct the decisions \nregarding ICT, such as difficulties of establishing tech-\nnical criteria for budget (line 5). Public administration \nagencies and entities have do not need to submit their \ntechnological initiatives to any sort of scrutiny and project \nselection to liberate resources. The aim of an investment \napproval process is associated with the capability of the \ninvestments in ICT to generate results towards the strat-\negy of the organization (WEILL and ROSS, 2006) or, in \nthe case of governments, their government plans. Lines \n4, 7, 9 and 10 confirm the inexistence of methodologies \nfor the management of projects, software requirements \nsurvey, ICT initiatives portfolio management and map-\nping, among others. This situation reveals that the insti-\ntutional design in vigor is characterized by a low-standard \ngovernance technology.\n\nStates possess, at least, committees managing ICT (line \n2, Exhibit 3), descending from Computing Committees \ncreated in the 1970s. Despite that, various interviewees \nstate that they are not operational and aggregate little ef-\nfectiveness to ICT management. It is small in its ability \nto bring about a framework to guarantee or help state \nexecutives to make decisions.\n\nThere is now in legislation an IT committee aiming to as-\n\nsess these demands, though, quite frankly, it\u2019s not working \n\nhere, it\u2019s not operational. (Interviewee #1, fragment from \n\ninterview, our underlining.)\n\nThat, like COSITE, it doesn\u2019t work and never really \n\nworked. It worked badly in previous managements. As far \n\nas I know, it was never even instituted. (Interviewee #11, \n\nfragment from interview, our underlining.)\n\nThe committees are little operational arrangements and \nthey aggregate marginal effectiveness to ICT manage-\nment. In addition to the lack of governance and the inef-\nfectiveness of the committees, the other lines in Exhibit \n3 reinforce the idea of fragility in ICT management in \nstate governments.\n\nIt is important to highlight that the levels of matu-\nrity in ICT management among different departments \nin each state are different. The interviewees highlighted \nthat there are agencies and departments with outstanding \nuse of ICT such as the Treasury Department. One of the \ninterviewees states:\n\nThe (...) State, by means of Professor (...) wanted to modern-\n\nize the whole collection process, the whole budget control \n\nprocess, both internal and external, and obtained internation-\n\nal resources. At the time, nearly 60 million US dollars were \n\napplied in the reformulation, reorganization and moderniza-\n\ntion of the Treasury. Then, there was a strong development. \n\n(Interviewee #12, fragment from the Interview.)\n\nOther participants point out differentiated ICT struc-\ntures in state treasuries. Most states have Departments \nof Treasury with their own data centers and ample \nstructures with a large quantity of professionals and \nICT processes. Regarding the other departments, State \nTreasuries perform a leading role in governmental tech-\nnological innovation due to a series of factors. Among \nthem: 1) the convincing and consequent support of the \nhigh administration regarding the strategic need for IT \nin operations; 2) the existence of incentive programs \nto the modernization of the financial administration \nof Brazilian states and cities financed by development \nagencies that help keep or increase IT investments, such \nas, for instant, the national program of fiscal administra-\ntion support (PNAFE), financed by the Inter-American \nDevelopment Bank (IDB); 3) greater base of knowledge \nand professionals enabled to use ICT intensively; 4) a \nlonger use of computational tools, consequently more \nmature, since state treasuries were historically one of the \nfirst groups in state governments to be computerized due \nto the need to control expenses and revenues.\n\n\n\nmArCoNI mArTINS DE LAIA \u2022 mArIA ALEXANDrA VIEGAS CorTEZ DA CuNHA \u2022 ANToNIo roBErTo rAmoS NoGuEIrA \u2022 JoS\u00e9 AfoNSo mAZZoN\n\nISSN 0034-7590 \u00a9RAE  \u2022  S\u00e3o Paulo  \u2022  v. 51  \u2022  n. 1  \u2022  jan./fev. 2011  \u2022  043-057  \u2022  53\n\nAs the institutional context in vigor does not offer ar-\nticulated patterns for technology management, nor does \nit interpose constraints for the actors to use e-gov coor-\ndinately, it is reasonable to infer that departments with \nhigher degrees of development will continue to perform \ntheir investments and move away from those with incipi-\nent models.\n\nRegarding the role of state computing organizations, \nthe participants in this research mention they lack a clearer \ninstitutional mission:\n\nThere\u2019s no clear definition: \u201cWhy would I want an IT com-\n\npany in the State? Do I want it or not? Is it better to live \n\nwith or without it? And if I do want it, I need to demand \n\nsomething from it.\u201d (Interviewee #3, fragment from the \n\ninterview, our underlining.)\n\nThis scenario is consistent with the observations made by \nFernandes (2007). One of the major institutional design \nchallenges in e-gov policies is to define, with clarity, the \nacting model for computing companies in Federal, State \nand City ambits. He states that there is no clear perception \nin Brazil on the proper role for computing organizations. \nFor him, \u201cthe definition of their role in alignment with \nan e-gov strategy is one of the most important items in \nthe institutionalization of Brazilian e-gov.\u201d (FERNANDES, \n2007, p. 502).\n\nAnother important element refers to the architecture \nand administration of state government data. Advanced \nlevels of e-gov involve cooperation structures in various \nagencies and a persistent work in order to guarantee the \ninteroperability of the applications (HEEKS, 1998; ONU/\nASPA, 2008). The key to integrate processes, in a techno-\nlogical perspective, goes through effective management \nof the data of the organization.\n\nExhibit 4 shows partially the case node IT Management \nin the items specifically related with Data Administration.\n\nOne of the interviewees affirms:\n\nThere\u2019s none. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to set up now in \n\nthis architecture. We\u2019re trying to make this integration \n\nhappen, this data administration more effective. Not even \n\nmore effective \u2013 make it happen, because it\u2019s just not there. \n\n(Interviewee #6, fragment from the interview.)\n\nData management is not completely absent, as there is \nmanagement linked to each one of the systems, especially \ncorporative ones that perform central functions such as \nbudgets, finances, human resources, purchases, among \nothers. Still, the management is vertical, restricted to the \nlimit of each system and does not consider interconnec-\ntions between processes. There are no patterns of interop-\nerability.

The in-\nstitutional design does not offer enforcement conditions \nfor the harmonious use of ICT.\n\nState secretarial technology areas notice that the rules \nof the game are not constructed aiming to promote coordi-\nnation and integration of e-gov initiatives. To act without \nintegration offers a less expensive option, since there is \nnot need to deal with typical difficulties of articulation \namong departments. And since there are no enforcement \nconditions (lines 3 and 4; Exhibit 3), an institutional de-\nsign in which non-integrated decisions are legitimized is \noutlined (MMERGUT, 2006).\n\nProviding services, transparency and participation\nNow, the field of results. It is a fact that the use of ICT to \nprovide public services has become part of the state gov-\nernmental agenda. In the states, there are some leading \nagencies and entities in this initiative, such as the depart-\nments of treasury, traffic, education and commerce. Even \nwhen the services are not fully provided by digital means, \nwe observed a concern in providing precise information to \nthe citizens \u201cif I am in the (...) state, regarding size, quan-\ntity of services the government provides for the citizen, \nto inform well is quite a precious service\u201d (Interviewee \n#14, fragment from interview).\n\nThere is growth in the ombudsman services provided. \nSome states establish criteria to make it possible to meet \nthe demand for information and services directed to pub-\n\nlic administration. The presence of ombudsmen indicates \nthat state governments moved towards paying satisfaction \non the demands that are directed to them.\n\nOn the other hand, interviews design a scenario of \nservices with low interactivity, problems in providing \nservices when they involve more than one governmental \nagency and the need to modernize the back-office so as to \nfacilitate the computerization of processes and services. \nProviding e-services is, in may cases, emergent and with \nlittle development in transversal services, limiting to each \nagency\u2019s initiatives.\n\nThe internet is used for the transparency of govern-\nmental information in the issues required by law. The \nuse of e-gov initiaves for social participation is small. \nAdvanced e-gov levels, called e-governance by authors \nsuch as Ruediger (2002), are still little developed.\n\nAt the moment when the research was carried out, there \nare citizen participation initiatives in public policies us-\ning digital means: \u201cThat\u2019s what they call democracy, isn\u2019t \nit? I still think it\u2019s rather inexpressive.\u201d (Interviewee #13, \nfragment from the interview.)\n\nNeither the integrated service providing nor the use of \nthe internet as a mechanism of transparency and partici-\npation has reached it potential. These results corroborate \nthose found in Pinho (2008), on Brazilian governmental \nportals with the appropriate technology, lower interactiv-\nity in services, absence of transparency excepting the items \ndefined by law, and also the inexistence of participation \nmechanisms. The results show that the little integrated \ninstitutional arrangement of e-gov initiatives ends up \ndamaging transversal digital services, to foment the ample \nexchange of information among public agencies and be-\ntween them and society.\n\nExhibit 4 \u2013 Partial presentation of the case node IT management\n\nCASE NODE: IT MANAGEMENT\n\nTREE NODE: DATA ARCHITECTURE AND ADMINISTRATION; ORGANIzATIONAL STRUCTURE AND ARRANGEMENTS; IT MANAGEMENT\n\nFREE NODES CODED \nINTERVIEwS\n\nCODE \nFRAGMENTS\n\n11 11) ARQUIT \u2013 01 \u2013 Little sharing and governance in data administration 13 26\n\n12\n11) ARQUIT \u2013 02 \u2013 Inexistence of data administration \u2013 problem integrating citizen information \nand for the government itself \u2013 each system regards citizens under different views\n\n6 12\n\n13\n11) ARQUIT \u2013 05 \u2013 Existence of data administration linked to systems with special attention to \ncorporative systems\n\n7 11\n\n14 11) ARQUIT \u2013 04 \u2013 Interoperability 6 10\n\n15 11) ARQUIT \u2013 07 \u2013 Establishing data administration would be too complex 2 4\n\n\n\nmArCoNI mArTINS DE LAIA \u2022 mArIA ALEXANDrA VIEGAS CorTEZ DA CuNHA \u2022 ANToNIo roBErTo rAmoS NoGuEIrA \u2022 JoS\u00e9 AfoNSo mAZZoN\n\nISSN 0034-7590 \u00a9RAE  \u2022  S\u00e3o Paulo  \u2022  v. 51  \u2022  n. 1  \u2022  jan./fev. 2011  \u2022  043-057  \u2022  55\n\nCoNCLuSIoN\n\nThe aim moving this research was to understand the insti-\ntutional design of e-gov in states of the Brazilian federation \nand how it facilitates the gains associated with e-gov. For \nsuch, we dwelled on the regulatory and normative context, \nthe government planning formulation, e-gov and ICT, ICT \nmanagement and the obtained results.\n\nBrazilian e-gov appeared in the early 2000s in the con-\ntext of State Reform movements, inheriting characteristics \nand utilization structure from ICTs in Brazilian public \nadministration, with state computing organizations and \ncommittees similar to state computing councils. Some \nstates and cities attempted certain changes and there was \ngreat availability of services to the population in the first \ndecade of this century. New public management prac-\ntices were and are being implemented in some Brazilian \nstates, which require computing appropriateness. The \nBrazilian public sector is regulated, with formal financial \nand budget planning. The technological context is one of \nnew technologies appearing and of new forms of using \nthem, whose good example are the tools from Web 2.0 \nand social networks that use it.\n\nRetarding computing and e-gov planning, there are no \nareas responsible for ICT management with the power to \ncoordinate computing efforts. ICT budget is managed by \neach department (government area). In each state, there \nis also ICT budget managed by a structuring project. \nThere is no budget coordination or articulation, which \nreplicates efforts, rework, unnecessary costs, in addition \nto nearly insurmountable integration challenges. ICT \narchitecture is almost inexistent, excepting certain corpo-\nrative systems. Infrastructure management is fragmented \nthroughout the agencies, although there are IT structures \n(companies or agencies) that could perform this role. \nThere is no coordinated identification or prioritization \nof applications. The current concern focus is seemingly \ncircumscribed to the form the organization should take \n(mixed-economy company, agency, autarchy) and not \nwhat role this organization should perform. There are flex-\nibility and integration barriers that are hard to overcome \nif there is no concern with coordinated management and \nthe establishment of standards for governmental data. IT \nmanagement historical problems in the states, such as \nlittle alignment with governmental policies and with the \nneeds of the departments, were not surmounted with the \nimplementation of e-gov.\n\nICT policies in state government lack institutional-\nization. It is a challenge to establish solid guidelines for \nthe initiatives in this area. E-gov is characterized by the \n\nfragmentation of initiatives and the difficulty in horizon-\ntal coordination among various governmental agencies. \nE-gov policies in state governments are not strong enough \nto interpose constraints to the behavior of the actors. \nEach agency plans by itself, not managing ICT from the \nstandards fro the state and there is no corporative data \nadministration. If, at a given moment, this design favored \nthe offer of services to the population by the more com-\nputerized agencies and/or more entrepreneurs, such as the \nDepartment of Treasury and the Department of Traffic, \nnow it interposes barriers to the offering of integrated \nand transactional processes in order to promote network \nintegration.\n\nThe costs of \u201ckeeping it as it is\u201d are smaller than those \nof facing the challenges of coordinating efforts. There are \nno enforcement mechanisms, nor financial ones, nor the \nloss of power or legitimacy, to make it disadvantageous \nfor the actors to remain as they are. The results of e-gov \npolicies are an offer of services that evolves within the \nscope of each department, but with great difficulties to \noffer integrated services, interdepartmental or even among \ndifferent spheres of government or powers. There is no \nuse of ICT in participation and transparency, excepting \nthe areas defined by law (enforcement). The analysis on \ne-service providing, transparency and participation initia-\ntives, and the effectiveness in public policies reveal that \nthe current institutional design of state e-gov policies \nbuild barriers to its development. The institutional design \nlimits the use of ICT, notably for not present regulating \nand normative elements capable of fomenting the imple-\nmentation of e-gov focusing on the transformation of \nprocesses and the integration of initiatives in the various \ngovernmental agencies.\n\nRegarding the agenda for the governments, we start \nfrom the observation that it is necessary to invest in e-gov, \nwith no naive perceptions of a technological determin-\nism, and understanding that state e-gov institutional ar-\nrangements, complex and with multiple actors, inherited \nhistorical characteristics from ICT use in Brazilian gov-\nernments and from the governmental context. Firstly, it is \nnecessary to build ICT policies that leverage government \nstrategies. Secondly, e-gov guidelines need to interpose \nobligations to the actors and enforcement conditions \nfor public managers. Still, e-gov initiatives seem to lack \nleadership and require strategy to replace discourses and \nbroaden the public administration transformation that lit-\nerature announces. Finally, the following items emerged in \nour research as important dimensions for formulation and \nplanning: ICT resource management and their structures \nand arrangements; data architecture and administration, \n\n\n\n56  \u2022  \u00a9RAE  \u2022  S\u00e3o Paulo  \u2022  v. 51  \u2022  n. 1  \u2022  jan./fev. 2011  \u2022  043-057 ISSN 0034-7590\n\nforum \u2022 ELECTroNIC GoVErNmENT PoLICIES IN BrAZIL: CoNTEXT, ICT mANAGEmENT AND ouTComES\n\nso as to reach results \u2013 providing public services, trans-\nparency, participation and effectiveness of public policies.\n\nrEfErENCES\n\nABRUCIO, F.
