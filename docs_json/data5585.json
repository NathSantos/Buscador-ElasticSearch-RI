Low-alkalinity matrix composites based on magnesium oxide cement reinforced with \n\ncellulose fibers. 2017. 160 p. Thesis (Doctorate) - Faculdade de Zootecnia e Engenharia de Alimentos, \n\nUniversidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, Pirassununga, 2017. \n\nA lower-alkalinity cement based on MgO and SiO2 blends is analysed to develop clinker-free Fibre \n\nReinforced Cementitious Composites (FRCC) with cellulosic fibres in order to solve the durability problems \n\nof this type of fibres when used in FRCC with Portland cement. Hydration evolution from 7 to 28 days of \n\ndifferent MgO-SiO2 formulations is assessed. The main hydration products are Mg(OH)2 and M-S-H gels for \n\nall  the formulations studied regardless of age. Hardened pastes are obtained with pH values &lt;11 and \n\ngood mechanical properties compared to conventional Portland cement. 60% MgO-40% SiO2 system is \n\nchosen as optimal for the development FRCC since is the most mechanical resistant and is less alkaline \n\ncompared with 70% MgO-30% SiO2. FRCC based on magnesium oxide and silica (MgO-SiO2) cement with \n\ncellulose fibres are produced to study the durability of lignocellulosic fibres in a lower pH environment \n\nthan the ordinary Portland cement (PC). Flexural performance and physical tests (apparent porosity, bulk \n\ndensity and water absorption) of samples at 28 days and after 200 accelerated ageing cycles (aac) are \n\ncompared. Two types of vegetable fibres are utilised: eucalyptus and pine pulps. MgO-SiO2 cement \n\npreserves cellulosic fibres integrity after ageing, so composites made out of MgO-SiO2 exhibit significant \n\nhigher performance after 200 cycles of accelerated ageing than Portland cement composites. High CO2 \n\nconcentration environment is evaluated as a curing treatment in order to optimise MgO- SiO2 matrices in \n\nFRCC. Samples are cured under two different conditions: 1) steam water curing at 55oC and 2) a \n\ncomplementary high CO2 concentration (20% by volume). In carbonated samples, Mg(OH)2 content is \n\nclearly lowered while new crystals of hydromagnesite [Mg5(CO3)4\u00b7(OH)2\u00b74H2O] are produced. After \n\ncarbonation, M-S-H gel content is also reduced, suggesting that this phase is also carbonated. Carbonation \n\naffects positively to the composite mechanical strength and physical properties with no deleterious effects \n\nafter ageing since it increases matrix rigidity. The addition of sepiolite in FRCC is studied as a possible \n\nadditive constituent of the binding matrix. Small cement replacement (1 and 2% wt.) by sepiolite is \n\nintroduced and studied in hardened cement pastes and, later, in FRCC systems. When used only in cement \n\npastes, it improves Dynamic Modulus of Elasticity over time. Bending tests prove the outcome of this \n\nadditive on the mechanical performance of the composite: it improves composite homogeneity. Ageing \n\neffects are reported after embedding sisal fibres in MgO-SiO2 and PC systems and submitting them to \n\ndifferent ageing conditions. This comparative study of fibre degradation applied in different cementitious \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nmatrices reveals the real compatibility of lignocellulosic fibres and Mg-based cements. Sisal fibres, even \n\nafter accelerated ageing, do neither suffer a significant reduction in cellulose content nor in cellulose \n\ncrystallinity and crystallite size, when exposed to MgO-SiO2 cement. Fibre integrity is preserved and no \n\ndeposition of cement phases is produced in MgO-SiO2 environment. \n\n \n\nKeywords: MgO-SiO2 binder; Low-alkalinity cementitious composite; Cellulose; Durability; Carbonation. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESUMO \n\nM\u00c1RMOL, G. Comp\u00f3sitos de baixa alcalinidade \u00e0 base de \u00f3xido de magn\u00e9sio refor\u00e7ados com fibras de \n\ncelulose. 2017. 160 p. Tese (Doutorado) - Faculdade de Zootecnia e Engenharia de Alimentos, \n\nUniversidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, Pirassununga, 2017. \n\nUm cimento de baixa alcalinidade \u00e0 base de blendas de MgO e SiO2 \u00e9 analisado para o desenvolvimento \n\nde Comp\u00f3sitos Ciment\u00edcios Refor\u00e7ados com Fibras (CCRF) celul\u00f3sicas sem cl\u00ednquer para resolver os \n\nproblemas de durabilidade de este tipo de fibras quando s\u00e3o usadas em CCRF com cimento Portland. A \n\nevolu\u00e7\u00e3o da hidrata\u00e7\u00e3o, desde 7 aos 28 dias, das diferentes formula\u00e7\u00f5es \u00e9 avaliada. Os principais produtos \n\nhidratados s\u00e3o o Mg(OH)2 e o gel M-S-H para todas as formula\u00e7\u00f5es independentemente da idade estudada. \n\nAs pastas endurecidas apresentam valores de pH &lt;11 e bom desempenho mec\u00e2nico comparado com o \n\ncimento Portland convencional. O sistema 60% MgO-40% SiO2 \u00e9 escolhido como a formula\u00e7\u00e3o \u00f3tima para \n\no desenvolvimento de CCRF j\u00e1 que \u00e9 a mais resistente e menos alcalina comparada com 70% MgO-30% \n\nSiO2. CCRF com cimento \u00e0 base de \u00f3xido de magn\u00e9sio e s\u00edlica (MgO-SiO2) e fibras celul\u00f3sicas s\u00e3o produzidos \n\npara a an\u00e1lise da durabilidade das fibras lignocelul\u00f3sicas em ambientes com valores de pH mais baixos \n\ncomparados com o cimento Portland (PC). O desempenho mec\u00e2nico a flex\u00e3o e os ensaios f\u00edsicos \n\n(porosidade aparente, densidade aparente e absor\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua) s\u00e3o comparados aos 28 dias e ap\u00f3s de 200 \n\nciclos de envelhecimento acelerado. O cimento \u00e0 base de MgO-SiO2 preserva a integridade das fibras ap\u00f3s \n\no envelhecimento. Os comp\u00f3sitos produzidos com este cimento exibem melhores propriedades ap\u00f3s 200 \n\nciclos de envelhecimento acelerado que os comp\u00f3sitos produzidos com cimento Portland. Ambientes com \n\nalta concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de CO2 s\u00e3o avaliados como tratamento de cura para otimizar as matrizes MgO- SiO2 nos \n\nCCRF. As amostras s\u00e3o curadas sob 2 condi\u00e7\u00f5es diferen\u00e7adas: 1) cura com vapor de \u00e1gua a 55oC e 2) cura \n\ncom alta concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de CO2 (20% do volume). As amostras carbonatadas apresentam teores reduzidos \n\nde Mg(OH)2 enquanto \u00e9 produzida uma nova fase cristalina: hidromagnesita [Mg5(CO3)4\u00b7(OH)2\u00b74H2O]. Ap\u00f3s \n\na carbonata\u00e7\u00e3o, o conte\u00fado de gel M-S-H \u00e9 reduzido tamb\u00e9m, indicando uma carbonata\u00e7\u00e3o desta fase. A \n\ncarbonata\u00e7\u00e3o aumenta a rigidez da matriz o que influi positivamente no desempenho mec\u00e2nico e as \n\npropriedades f\u00edsicas dos comp\u00f3sitos sem efeitos prejudiciais ao longo prazo. A adi\u00e7\u00e3o de sepiolita em CCRF \n\n\u00e9 estudada como poss\u00edvel adi\u00e7\u00e3o na composi\u00e7\u00e3o da matriz aglomerante. Baixos teores (1 e 2% em massa) \n\nde cimento s\u00e3o substitu\u00eddos por sepiolita para o estudo das pastas de cimento hidratado e, \n\nposteriormente, dos comp\u00f3sitos. O M\u00f3dulo El\u00e1stico Din\u00e2mico das pastas \u00e9 incrementado com o tempo \n\npela adi\u00e7\u00e3o de sepiolita. Os ensaios a flex\u00e3o demostram que a adi\u00e7\u00e3o de sepiolita melhora a \n\nhomogeneidade dos comp\u00f3sitos.

\n\nComposite materials are a key solution for universal challenges in terms of materials \n\nengineering and science. A composite material, also called composite, is a solid material that results \n\nwhen more than one substance, each with its own characteristics, are combined to create a new \n\nsubstance whose properties are superior to those of the original components in a specific \n\napplication (ENCYCLOP\u00c6DIA BRITANNICA, 2013). Remarkable properties of composites may be \n\nachieved by embedding fibres of one substance in a host matrix of another. That is the case of fibre-\n\nreinforced composites (FRC). \n\nWhile the structural value of a bundle of fibres is low, the strength of individual fibres can \n\nbe harnessed if they are embedded in a matrix that acts as an adhesive. Therefore, fibres impart \n\nstructural strength to the composite, while the matrix protects the fibres from environmental stress \n\nand physical damage and imparts thermal stability to them. The fibre-matrix combination also \n\nreduces the potential for a complete fracture; if one fibre fails cracking may not extend to other \n\nfibres, whereas a crack that starts in a monolithic (or single) material generally continues to \n\npropagate until that material fails (ENCYCLOP\u00c6DIA BRITANNICA, 2013). \n\nThe most used composite in the construction industry, sector within the scope of this \n\nresearch, is reinforced concrete. However, this work focuses on those materials formed by a \n\nhydraulic cementitious matrix and various discreetly incorporated aggregates and discontinuous \n\nfibres: Fibre Reinforced Cementitious Composites (FRCC). \n\nSustainability is a growing worldwide concern in view of the limited natural resources, \n\nenergy production, wastes disposal and polluting gases emissions. The use of regional agro-\n\nindustrial residues is a smart strategy to save energy in order to attend the global construction \n\nmarket. Ligno-cellulose pulp and vegetable fibre from several agro-industrial processes may also be \n\nan alternative solution for durable fibre-cement products and consequently more sustainable \n\nmaterials (ARDANUY; CLARAMUNT; TOLEDO FILHO, 2015). At the same time, the use of \n\nlignocellulosic fibres presents an attractive potential for tropical countries in Africa and South \n\nAmerica since their availability of quality materials that allow the manufacture of building elements \n\nat low cost. It also allows the development of a competent industry, with the possibility of \n\ninternational trade (SAVASTANO JR; WARDEN; COUTTS, 2003). In fact, with the development and \n\nhttp://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/369000/material\n\n\n19 \n \n\n \n\nevolution of the Hatschek technology, cellulose fibres have been traditionally used to retain fine \n\nparticles during the manufacturing process of fibre-cement products. \n\nDespite the advantages of using vegetable fibres as reinforcement in FRCC, a significant \n\ndrawback has been widely reported: the durability of composites. Contrarily to what happens with \n\nsynthetic fibres, i.e. polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polypropylene (PP), mechanical and physical \n\nintegrity of vegetable fibres are affected within the calcium based cement matrices. Under these \n\ncircumstances, in porous alkaline environments (pH> 12), cellulose based fibres are degraded \n\nprogressively, losing all its reinforcing performance. At this point is where research on new FRCC \n\nmust find a compromise solution, avoiding excessive energy costs that cause the production of \n\nsynthetic fibres and the limited durability offered by lignocellulosic fibres. \n\nLiterature regarding this loss of mechanical properties of vegetable fibres over time in \n\nPortland cement (PC) based FRCC claims that dissolution and decomposition of hemicellulose and \n\nlignin takes place. Thus, the cohesion between the individual fibres is broken at micro and macro \n\nscale. This breakdown is produced by the attack of (OH)- ions from the calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2] \n\nsolutions over hemicellulose and lignin molecules. Another detrimental effect on the mechanical \n\nperformance of the lignocellulosic fibres is the crystallization thereof. This phenomenon in PC based \n\nFRCC occurs when cellulose chains are surrounded by Ca2+ cations from Ca(OH)2 formed after \n\ncalcium silicates hydration (C-S-H). \n\nTraditionally, two strategies have been proposed to preserve cellulose-based fibres In FRCC: \n\n1. Reduction of the amount of Ca(OH)2 solution in the cement pores \n\n2. Fibre treatment for a chemical compatibility between cellulose based fibres and PC. \n\n \n\nHowever, these techniques have not totally succeeded in their purpose. The first one do not \n\navoid high concentrations of Portlandite, Ca(OH)2, in liquid phase reached during the early hours of \n\nthe hydration process (TAYLOR, 1997) and remain in large proportions (about 25%) in the matrix for \n\na certain period of time depending on the consumption speed. This portlandite reduction is not an \n\ninstantaneous process, so meanwhile fibres are subjected to highly alkaline environments. The \n\nsecond method would involve an industrial sophisticated technique that reduces the economic and \n\nenvironmental benefits of using vegetable fibres. \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\n \n\nIn this thesis, an alternative to avoid vegetable fibres degradation in FRCC is explored: the use of a \n\nclinker free cement, a cement based on MgO hydrated compounds, with insignificant content in Ca \n\n(<1% by mass). With the use of cement based on magnesium oxide, to the matrix direct contact with \n\nCa2+ is prevented. \n\nSince MgO solubility is more than 10 times lower compared to CaO, and therefore (OH)- \n\ncontent is also considerably lower, MgO-based cements are lower alkaline than PC. This new type \n\nof cement presents pH values below 11 over time, meanwhile Portland cement pH is above 12.5 \n\nfrom the very early stages of hydration (LEA; HEWLETT, 2004). This reduced alkalinity is essential to \n\nyield more stable environments on pores solutions at high moisture exposure conditions. Besides, \n\nMgO-based cements may offer satisfactory mechanical strength compared to PC.   \n\nAccording the above exposed statements, this work intends to: \n\n1. Obtain FRCC by using MgO-based cements as a hydraulic binder matrix and cellulose-based \n\nfibres as reinforcing elements  \n\n2. Achieve optimal mechanical performance of the intended FRCC \n\n3. Preserve lignocellulosic reinforcement properties at long term \n\nAlong next chapters that all together comprise this thesis, all the statements made in the \n\npresent chapter will be further developed, detailed and properly referenced. \n\n \n\n1.2 THE USE OF CELLULOSE-BASED MATERIALS AS REINFORCING ELEMENTS IN FRCC \n\n1.2.1 Global warming perspective \n\nIn spite of non-conclusive predictions on the upcoming effects of climate change, it exists a \n\nneat relationship between the rising temperature of both atmosphere and oceans and the increased \n\nconcentration of greenhouse effect gases on the atmosphere. All scientific evidences point out that \n\nclimate change will become more intense on the assumption that no reduction of greenhouse effect \n\ngases emissions is attained. In industrialized areas, it is especially worrying the emission of carbon \n\ndioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere from the combustion of fossil fuels due to the greenhouse effect \n\nof this gas. Different alternatives to alleviate this consequence are likely. \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\n \n\n1.2.2 CO2 encapsulation in cellulose as main approach \n\nIn order to face global warming a possible solution is to intake the excess of CO2 from the \n\natmosphere and store it. In nature, plants already naturally carry out this chemical process by \n\nphotosynthesis. Thus, carbon from CO2 becomes part of the plants structure, mainly composed by \n\nlarge polymeric chains. Encapsulating plant matter is presented as a potential technique to achieve \n\nthe atmospheric CO2 reduction. At the same time, plant fibres show excellent technical properties \n\nwhen used in composites, Table 1, that turn this material into an optimal choice to develop a low-\n\ncarbon or hypo-carbonic technology (BODROS; BALEY, 2008; BOURMAUD et al., 2013; FAKIROV; \n\nBHATTACHARYYA, 2007; FARUK et al., 2012; OCHI, 2008; OKSMAN; SKRIFVARS; SELIN, 2003; \n\nSUMMERSCALES et al., 2010). Since the renewable nature of plant fibres and the low energy \n\ndemand to obtain them, this technology is increasingly developed by different industries. However, \n\nit still exists a potential room for improvement and implementing this method in building and civil \n\nconstruction. \n\nTable 1- Mechanical properties of different fibres used in composites application  \n\n \n\nSource: The hygroscopic behaviour of plant fibres: a review (C\u00c9LINO, A. et al. The hygroscopic behavior of plant fibers: a \nreview. Frontiers in Chemistry, Lausanne, v. 1, art. 43, 2014).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\n \n\n1.2.3 Cellulose as fibre reinforcement \n\nConstruction industry historically payed minor attention to plant fibres due to the \n\nbiodegradable nature of these elements and, therefore, to the high maintenance cost and reduced \n\ndurability. A prospective application to iron this disadvantage out is the embedment of plant fibres \n\nwithin construction materials. This concept emulates millennial construction techniques as adobe. \n\nIn the case of cementitious materials, plant fibres may contribute to resist tension stresses the same \n\nway other reinforcing fibres do, while plant fibres are protected from environmental conditions so \n\nare sheltered from biological degradation.  \n\nTo understand the true potential of using use of cellulosic fibres in FRCC is necessary to \n\nconsider the potential benefits and disadvantages associated with this application. Some \n\nadvantages and disadvantages are highlighted below (SAVASTANO JR.; SANTOS; AGOPYAN, 2009):  \n\nTable 2-Advantages and disadvantages of using cellulosic-based fibres as reinforcement in FRCC \n\nAdvantages \n \n\nDisadvantages \n\n\u2022 Low specific weight \n \n\n\u2022 Characteristics dependent on uncontrollable factors \n\n? high specific mechanical properties \n \n\n? such as weather conditions \n\n\u2022 Renewable resource \n \n\n\u2022 High moisture absorption \n\n\u2022 Little energy for its production \n \n\n? increases in volume of the fibre \n\n? while oxygen is released to the environment \n \n\n\u2022 Limited temperature in the obtaining process \n\n\u2022 Produced with minimal investment \n \n\n\u2022 Price can fluctuate depending on: \n\n\u2022 Good thermal and acoustic properties \n \n\n-crop yields \n\n    -agricultural policies  \n\nSource: SAVASTANO JR., H.; SANTOS, S. F.; AGOPYAN, V. 3 - Sustainability of vegetable fibres in construction. In: KHATIB, \nJ. M. (Ed.). Sustainability of construction materials. Cambridge: Woodhead Publishing, 2009. p. 55\u201381.  \n\n \n\nThis approach was initially taken by fibre-cement industry given that asbestos fibres became \n\ngradually banned because of their hazardousness for human health. Nevertheless, the use of plant \n\nfibres as reinforcing elements in cementitious composites was not successful due to the durability \n\nof the products. It was found to be degraded under cement alkaline environment and, consequently, \n\nthe benefit of using plant fibres was futile. Then, fibre-cement industry moved to alternative more \n\nchemically compatible reinforcing polymeric fibres, as PVA initially and PP recently, though their \n\nhigher economic, energetic and environmental cost (IKAI et al., 2010). Still, natural cellulose (type I) \n\nmicrofibrils in the crystalline regions, zoomed in Figure 1b, have outstanding elastic properties i.e. \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\n \n\nYoung\u2019s Modulus in between 128 and 155GPa, that when it is weighted by its specific density of \n\naround (1.5 g\u00b7cm-3) results in a specific Young\u2019s Modulus of around 138GPa\u00b7g-1\u00b7cm-3. \n\n \n\n1.2.4 Structure of cellulose-based fibres \n\nThough cellulose is the main component of plant fibres and the responsible for the \n\nexceptional reinforcing properties, it is important to note that cellulose is not the only constituent \n\nof plant fibres. Besides, each plant species shows differences in fibres microstructure with those of \n\nother species. It also should be noted that the microstructure of a single fibre is quite complex, and \n\nthe fibres are composed of many cells fibre, as shown in Figure 1, where a sisal fibre section is \n\nschematically displayed. \n\nFigure 1- Schematic cross section (a) and representation of the structure (b) of a sisal fibre \n\n \n\nSource: BENTUR, A.; MINDESS, S. Fibre reinforced cementitious composites2nd ed. London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 2007. p. \n431. \n\nIn the particular case of sisal fibres, schematised in Figure 1a, its diameter is 0.3 mm and the \n\ncross section may be compound up to about 100 cells. The structure of a single cell presented \n\nschematically in Figure 1b, shows several layers of fibrils making up the fibre wall. The orientation \n\nof the fibrils of each layer of the wall is different. Secondary S2 wall is oriented in the macrofibre \n\ndirection and mainly composed by large molecules of cellulose, with a degree of polymerization of \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\n \n\nabout 25,000. The chains of cellulose molecules are grouped into longitudinal microfibrils. The other \n\ncomponents of the cell wall, hemicellulose and lignin, have much lower polymerization degrees and \n\nare mainly in the middle lamella connecting the cells of individual fibres together. Thus, sisal fibres \n\nare made out of approximately 54\u201366% cellulose, 12\u201317% hemicellulose, 7\u201314% lignin, 1% pectin \n\nand 1\u20137% ash (MELO FILHO; SILVA; TOLEDO FILHO, 2013). \n\nIn recent years, an important scientific effort has been put to understand cellulose \n\ndegradation process and significant advances are reached (MELO FILHO; SILVA; TOLEDO FILHO, \n\n2013; MOHR; NANKO; KURTIS, 2005; MOHR; BIERNACKI; KURTIS, 2006; TOL\u00caDO FILHO et al., 2000; \n\nTOLEDO FILHO et al., 2009; SILVA; MOBASHER; TOLEDO FILHO, 2009; WEI; MEYER, 2014). With \n\ncurrent expertise, plant fibres are presented as a viable alternative to synthetic polymeric fibres for \n\nthe fibre-cement industry and several products have been developed both in lab and industrial \n\nscale, proving the viability of this technology. Also further technical defies arise from this experience \n\nand new ways of reinforcing materials may be explored, even replacing steel reinforcing bars from \n\nconcrete structures. In this sense, the replacement of steel materials by cellulose would involve an \n\nextra CO2 reduction since the high energy cost necessary to produce steel products in contrast with \n\ncellulose ones. \n\n \n\n1.3 PERFORMANCE OF THE FIBRES AS REINFORCEMENT FOR BENDING SOLICITATIONS \n\nRegarding fibres capacity to reinforce FRCC, it is assumed that in cement matrices under \n\nbending loads, lignocellulosic fibres induce mechanisms of fracture with a linear elastic branch \n\n(BENTUR; MINDESS, 2007). This is in contrast with unreinforced cement elements, which have a \n\nbrittle behaviour. Thus, fibres addition to the matrix increases bending strength and the capacity of \n\nFRCC to absorb more energy before breaking by the distribution of the cracks throughout the \n\nmaterial. \n\nRupture or collapse in the FRCC comes from an inside defect. These deficiencies include \n\nbroken fibres, imperfection in the cement matrix or debonding between the matrix and the fibre.  \n\nFigure 2 shows a schematic representation of a cross section of any composite reinforced with an \n\nindeterminate fibre. \n\n  \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2- Schematic representation of a cross section of any composite reinforced with an indeterminate fibre \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: TONOLI, G. H. D. Fibras curtas de Eucalipto para novas tecnologias em fibrocimento. 2010. 128 f. Tese \n(Doutorado) \u2013 Interunidades em Ci\u00eancias e Engenharia de Materiais, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Carlos, 2010. \n\n \n\nThe illustration shows a break point before the global collapse. It is also shown that at a \n\ndistance from the start of the crack, which propagates along the section, the fibres remain intact. In \n\nthe fracturing process, the fibres tend to assist in the distribution of the stresses generated in the \n\nmaterial by the friction generated between matrix and fibre and chemical bonding forces between \n\nthem. If bond stresses and these hydrogen bonds do not exceed the maximum tensile stress of the \n\nfibre, a debonding process at the interface between fibre and matrix (points 1 and 2 in Figure 2) is \n\nproduced. This debonding, also known as pull-out, is produced by the breaking of hydrogen bonding \n\nand physical type forces at the interface between fibre (point 3 in Figure 2). Pull-out means higher \n\ntoughness performance of the material. Otherwise, when the fibre strength is lower than that of \n\nthe chemical and physical forces generated between fibre and matrix, what occurs is breaking of \n\nthe fibre, which leads to a decrease in toughness of the composite. \n\nTherefore, to avoid a brittle material behaviour it must found a compromise where the \n\nfibre-matrix adhesion forces are balanced with the chemical adhesion mechanisms. It is also \n\nimportant to remember that water plays an important role in the mechanisms of adhesion of the \n\nfibres in the matrix, since the insertion of water molecules between the hydroxyl groups at the \n\ninterface generates weaker hydrogen bonding between fibre and matrix (TONOLI, 2010). \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\n \n\n1.4 DURABILITY OF THE VEGETABLE FIBRES IN CEMENTITIOUS MATRICES \n\nDespite the potential benefits produced by the use of vegetable fibres as reinforcement in \n\nFRCC, these fibres present a huge inconvenience to solve their: durability. The long-term \n\nperformance of composites reinforced with cellulose fibres can be affected by several processes, \n\neither separately or at the same time. \n\n \n\n1.4.1 Fibres degradation \n\nTraditionally two fibre degradation mechanisms have been mainly reported in FRCC \n\ncomposites: fibre mineralization due to the precipitation of calcium hydroxide in the fibre cell and \n\nsurface (SINGH, 1985) and degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin due to the adsorption \n\nof calcium and hydroxyl ions (GRAM, 1983a, 1983b, 1986). Degradation of cellulose is not \n\nconsidered responsible for the major deterioration of the fibres, principally due to this process takes \n\nplaces at temperatures over 75oC and because of the large degree of polymerization of cellulose \n\n(>25,000). Thus the studies regarding alkaline attack have been focused on hemicellulose and lignin \n\ndegradation which are amorphous with relative low polymerization degree, so they have a higher \n\nhydrolysis rate and solubility in alkaline medium than cellulose (WEI; MEYER, 2014). \n\nThrough years of research these two mechanisms have confirmed and they and their effects \n\nhave been widely studied (TOLEDO FILHO et al., 2009; MELO FILHO; SILVA; TOLEDO FILHO, 2013; \n\nWEI; MEYER, 2014). Figure 3 shows the two main mechanisms of degradation of a sisal fibre. \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3- Schematic representation of the mechanisms of degradation of a sisal fibre \n\n \n\nSource: MELO FILHO, J. de A.; SILVA, F. de A.; TOLEDO FILHO, R. D. Degradation kinetics and aging mechanisms on sisal \nfiber cement composite systems. Cement and Concrete Composites, Kidlington, v. 40, p. 30\u201339, July. 2013. \n\n \n\nAs lignin and hemicellulose are responsible for linking the microfibril structure, their \n\ndegradation may also lead to a reduction in the macro mechanical properties of the fibres as a result \n\nof breaking the link between individual fibre cells (GRAM, 1983a; MELO FILHO; SILVA; TOLEDO \n\nFILHO, 2013; WEI; MEYER, 2014). This process is schematically explained in Figure 4. \n\nFigure 4- Schematic representation of alkaline hydrolysis on sisal fibre \n\n \n\nSource: BENTUR, A.; MINDESS, S. Fibre reinforced cementitious composites. 2nd ed. London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 2007. \np.458. \n\nVegetable fibres can suffer various degrees of degradation when exposed to an alkaline \n\nenvironment. The extent of the attack, as determined by strength loss of the fibres, depends on the \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\n \n\nkind of alkaline solution (TOLEDO FILHO et al., 2009). The embrittlement of the composites may be \n\nmainly associated with the mineralisation of the fibres due to the migration of hydration products, \n\nespecially calcium hydroxide, to the fibre lumen, walls and voids (TOLEDO FILHO et al., 2000). This \n\nmay also reduce the amount of cellulose (MELO FILHO; SILVA; TOLEDO FILHO, 2013).  \n\nDespite of all researches agree that mineralisation brittles the fibres so toughness may be \n\nseverely decreased, there is no wide assent about the effects on fibres tensile strength. Some \n\nauthors (AKERS; STUDINKA, 1989) suggest that the fibre flexural strength increases with \n\nprettification, while some others propose the opposite (TOLEDO FILHO et al., 2009; MELO FILHO; \n\nSILVA; TOLEDO FILHO, 2013). Nevertheless, even considering positive effects on fibre tensile \n\nstrength, fibre mineralization is an undesired phenomenon since it also reduces the pull-out \n\nmechanism in FRCC. \n\nAnother factor to be considered is that fibres degradation is more obvious when they are \n\nattacked by Ca(OH)2 than with other alkaline hydroxide solutions. This aspect may be associated \n\nwith the calcium hydroxide deposited in the lumen and voids of the fibre cells (GRAM, 1983a; SINGH, \n\n1985; TOLEDO FILHO et al., 2000). According to this, apart from alkaline attack it is important the \n\ncomposition of alkaline minerals that contribute differently to the mineralization process of the \n\nfibres. \n\nAccording to different studies where FRCC is assessed by accelerated ageing tests, the \n\ndegradation process occurs rapidly, from the early stages (MELO FILHO; SILVA; TOLEDO FILHO, 2013; \n\nWEI; MEYER, 2014) and after longer ages a quite expressive modification in the flexural behaviour \n\nis observed. In these works, the residual mechanical parameters after accelerated ageing are the \n\nsame as those observed in the unreinforced matrix. It was proposed that the initial calcium \n\nhydroxide content in the composite plays a significant role on the degradation along with wetting \n\nand drying cycles. Improvements in the composite durability are likely related to a reduction in the \n\ncalcium hydroxide content and the stabilization of the alkali content. For the composites with \n\nreduced content in Ca(OH)2, fibre mineralization was satisfactorily prevented (MELO FILHO; SILVA; \n\nTOLEDO FILHO, 2013). Accelerated ageing treatments speed up the effect of both alkali hydrolysis \n\nof fibre\u2019s amorphous components and mineralization of fibre cell wall. This was confirmed by the \n\nhighest crystallinity indices and minimum content of cellulose (WEI; MEYER, 2014). \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\n \n\n1.4.2 Fibre-matrix interface modification \n\nThis process of degradation is important because strength and ductility performance is \n\nprimarily governed by the fibre\u2013matrix interface (BENTUR; MINDESS, 2007), or also called Interface \n\nTransition Zone (ITZ) , which allows fibre bridging and bonding mechanism which results in the \n\ndistribution of micro-crack pattern (MELO FILHO; SILVA; TOLEDO FILHO, 2013). Reductions in the \n\nfrictional stress may be produced because of an interface fatigue mechanism. This is due to the \n\nvolumetric variation of the sisal fibres after wetting and drying stress (MELO FILHO; SILVA; TOLEDO \n\nFILHO, 2013). Since the reductions in the frictional stress, reduction in strength and toughness is \n\nproduced from the early ages of the composites.  \n\nSeveral studies, with help of Scanning Electrons Microscopy (SEM), have reported \n\nmodifications in the ITZ over time. In these studies was found that the gap between the binding \n\nzone surrounding the fibre surface and the fibre perimeter is larger in an unaged specimens than in \n\nthe specimen submitted to ageing (TOLEDO FILHO et al., 2000). \n\nThere are mechanical properties specifically related to these modifications in the ITZ. \n\nCertain works associate a weak matrix in the vicinity of the fibre, and therefore its easiness for \n\ncracking, to the increase of the FRCC ductility (SAVASTANO JR; WARDEN; COUTTS, 2005). These \n\nauthors points to the densening of matrix areas around the fibres or fibre embrittlement due to \n\nmigration of hydration products from the matrix to the fibres as the main that increases flexural \n\nstrength until first crack appears. This increase for the first crack to appear yields reduction in \n\ntoughness, by reducing the flexibility and deformation capacity of the fibres (TOLEDO FILHO et al., \n\n2000).  \n\nHowever, other authors consider denser matrices surrounding the fibres as more favouring \n\nconditions for pull-out processes to occur. In this sense, a denser ITZ is likely to improve the contact \n\nbetween fibres and cement matrix, and certainly favouring the better adhesion between them. \n\nThus, higher energy is absorbed by the composite due to the frictional slipping process during the \n\npulling-out of fibres with a better interface with the matrix (ALMEIDA et al., 2013; PIZZOL et al., \n\n2014). \n\n \n\n\n\n30 \n \n\n \n\n1.5 SOLUTIONS AGAINST THE DEGRADATION OF CELLULOSE-BASED FIBRES \n\n1.5.1 Low Ca(OH)2 cementitious matrices \n\nAs previously mentioned, the lignin-cellulosic fibres used as reinforcements in FRCC exhibit \n\nserious problems of durability due to a number of factors, most notably the fibre degradation in \n\nhighly alkaline environments. The majority of studies in this area agree that this loss of mechanical \n\nproperties of the vegetable fibres over time in PC matrices is caused by the dissolution and \n\ndecomposition of hemicellulose and lignin of the middle layer. Thus, the link between the individual \n\nfibres is broken. This breakdown is produced by the attack of OH- ions from the Ca(OH)2 on lignin \n\nand hemicelluoses. In turn, another detrimental effect on the mechanical performance of the fibres \n\nis the crystallization thereof and embrittlement of the ITZ. This phenomenon occurs when the cell \n\nlumen is filled with cations Ca2+ and fibre surrounding presents a high Ca(OH)2 concentration \n\nexceeding from calcium silicates hydration. \n\nIt seems logical, therefore, eliminate, or at least reduce the amount of Ca(OH)2 in the \n\nmatrices to improve the durability of the fibres. Many authors have already achieved successful \n\nexperiences by this approach. \n\n \n\n1.5.2 Use of pozzolan additions \n\nWithin the traditional cement manufacturing process, considering the energy required for \n\ncement production processes and the stoichiometry of limestone and clay calcination (which also \n\nimplies CO2 emissions), a straight route to reduce CO2 emissions has been the reduction of clinker \n\nto obtain cementitious materials. This reduction of clinker is likely through the replacement of \n\nPortland cement by other binding products. This proposed solution, the reduction of calcium \n\nhydroxide within the cementitious matrix, becomes a real solution with the partial replacement of \n\ncement by pozzolanic materials (JOHN et al., 2005; MOHR; BIERNACKI; KURTIS, 2007; SAVASTANO \n\nJR.; SANTOS; AGOPYAN, 2009; SANTOS et al., 2012).  \n\nWhen referring to the pozzolanic materials is referred to all, both natural and artificial, \n\nmaterials capable of combining directly with lime, at room temperature and in the presence of \n\nwater, to form inorganic cementitious materials compounds similar to those major constituents \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\n \n\noriginated in the hydration of Portland cement. Also pozzolans are defined as follows (EN \n\n494:2012+A1:2015, 2012): \n\nSiliceous or siliceous and aluminous material which, in itself, possesses little or no \n\ncementitious value but which will, in finely divided form and in the presence of water, react \n\nchemically with calcium hydroxide at ordinary temperature to form compounds possessing \n\ncementitious properties. \n\nIn this regard, it should be noted that Ca(OH)2, (CH), present in cement matrices is derived \n\nfrom the hydration reactions of bicalcium silicate (C2S) and tricalcium (C3S) to form calcium silicate \n\nhydrate gel (C3S2H3) commonly mentioned as S-C-H phase. It is in this hydration reaction where the \n\ncalcium hydroxide or portlandite is released according to the following equations: \n\n2C2S +4H ? C3S2H3 +  CH (1) \n\n2C3S +6H ? C3S2H3 +  3CH (2) \n\n \n\nThus, pozzolans therefore react with the calcium hydroxide released by the hydration of \n\nPortland cement to give other products of desirable mechanical properties as hydrated gels (silicates \n\n(SCH), aluminates (ACH) and calcium silico-aluminates hydrated (ASCH), as shown below (Figure 5): \n\nS +  CH +  H ? SCH (3) \n\n  A+  CH +  H ? ACH (4) \n\nSA +  CH +  H ? ASCH (5) \n\n \n\nTherefore, the use of pozzolanic materials, in addition to meeting the goal of eliminating \n\nPortlandite content, help to improve the mechanical strength of the cementitious matrix. \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_hydroxide\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement\n\n\n32 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5- Diagram of a pozzolanic reaction in conventional Portland cement \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\nConsidering the previous premises, 1) incorporation of plant fibre to resist tension stresses and \n\n2) removal of Ca(OH)2 from the final hydrated binding composition, the partial replacement of PC \n\nby pozzolanic materials has been explored. \n\n \n\n1.5.3 Use of carbonation techniques  \n\nIn order to reduce the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, a similar strategy is the \n\nencapsulation of carbon within cementitious matrices. This procedure has been traditionally \n\navoided in order to prevent steel reinforcement corrosion in building constructions. One the main \n\nfeatures of hardened Portland cement is its high alkalinity, which allows the passivation of the steel \n\nbars that reinforce concrete elements (TAYLOR, 1997). This elevated alkalinity is given by Ca(OH)2 \n\nfrom the cement hydration process, which is very soluble, releasing Ca2+ and (OH)- ions to the \n\ncement pores suspensions. While Ca(OH)2 is desirable in terms of steel protection, this hydrated \n\nconstituent is considered to provide reduced mechanical performance, being considered the \n\nweakest component of aged cement. Therefore, in cementitious materials where steel \n\nreinforcement is not required, Ca(OH)2 would not be of any importance, being its replacement by \n\nother stronger components a beneficial technique.  \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\n \n\nA possibility for both carbon encapsulation and Ca(OH)2 reduction in PC is possible through \n\ncarbonation. Carbonation is a physicochemical process that takes place within the pores of \n\nhardened Portland cement. In the aqueous solution within PC matrices, Ca(OH)2 is constantly solved \n\nand precipitated according to (6). High alkalinity, and therefore high (OH)- concentrations, in \n\naqueous solutions promotes the easy formation of carbonic acid (H2CO3) so CO2 gets dissolved,  as \n\nshown in (7). Thus, alkalinity is reduced which favours the precipitation of calcite, (CaCO3), following \n\n(8). \n\nCa(OH)2 ? Ca\n2+ +2(OH)? (6) \n\n CO2 +H2O ? H2CO3 ? 2H\n+ +CO3\n\n2? (7) \n\nCa2+ +2(OH)? +2H+ +CO3\n2? ? CaCO3 +H2O (8) \n\n \n\nCarbonation in PC based materials naturally occurs at environmental conditions over time. \n\nThis process is more important on the edges of the settled PC based elements, losing its effectivity \n\nto the inwards of the elements. CO2 gets through the matrix pores and starts the carbonation \n\nprocess. This way, carbonation of cement elements has been proved to meet this principle, both \n\nremoving Ca(OH)2  by its reaction with CO2 and producing calcium carbonate (CaCO3), a denser \n\ncomponent, more rigid and stronger (FR\u00cdAS; GO\u00d1I, 2013; MORANDEAU; THI\u00c9RY; DANGLA, 2015; \n\nMO; ZHANG; DENG, 2015; ZHA et al., 2015). Though densification of cement yields better \n\nmechanical attributes to the hydrated cement, it also hinders environmental CO2 to the core of the \n\nPC based elements. This problem has already sorted out by the modification of the environment \n\nconditions (CO2 concentration increase, optimal humidity and temperature) to boost carbonation \n\nreactions in the early stages of PC within the whole matrix. \n\nBesides, in conjunction with the first strategy to encapsulate CO2 using  plant fibres as \n\nreinforcing material, carbonation becomes a favourable option since the removal of Ca(OH)2 from \n\ncement matrices has been evidenced efficient to increase cellulose durability and encapsulate CO2. \n\nWhen fibre-cement products are exposed to elevated CO2 concentration at early ages, moreover, \n\ntechnical features are improved, obtaining outstanding products along with the encapsulation of \n\nCO2 from the environment (ALMEIDA et al., 2013; PIZZOL et al., 2014; PURNELL; SHORT; PAGE, 2001; \n\nPURNELL et al., 2003; SANTOS et al., 2015a). \n\n \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\n \n\n1.5.4 Fibre treatments  \n\nAnother methodology to achieve a better long-term performance of the FRCC is the partial \n\nmodification of the fibres\u2019 properties. Since fibre degradation is produced via contact with some \n\ncompounds from PC hydration, it is also possible to avoid a direct interface between alkaline \n\nenvironments and potential degradable components of plant fibres (hemicellulose and lignin \n\nmainly) by modifying the surface of the fibres. This is feasible using different techniques such as \n\ngrafting with different agents (BELGACEM; GANDINI, 2005; TONOLI et al., 2009b, 2013) and \n\nmethane plasma treatment (BARRA et al., 2012), amongst others. The positive effects of these type \n\nof treatments on the durability of the fibres over time along with the possibility of combining any \n\nfibre treatment with less alkaline matrix boost this methodology.  \n\nBesides, other crude methods, like bleaching and hornification (TONOLI et al., 2012; \n\nBALLESTEROS et al., 2015), have been satisfactorily explored. Although these techniques are not \n\nentirely effective to avoid fibre degradation, it is possible to use them together with lower alkaline \n\nmatrices. Thus, the effects of these methods are more effective with no interference.  \n\n \n\n1.5.5 Limitations of the proposed solutions \n\nDespite the apparent benefits of the use of pozzolanic materials or carbonation techniques \n\nto improve the durability of vegetable fibres within a cement matrix, its application has limitations. \n\nThe main obstacle is the chemical activity, pozzolanic activity or carbonation activity, which is based \n\nin the reaction with Ca2+ from Ca(OH)2. Pozzolanic reaction and carbonation are not instantaneous \n\nprocesses, so while the pozzolan and CO2 reacts with portlandite, fibres undergo highly alkaline \n\nenvironments. Considering that Ca(OH)2 in dissolved in an aqueous solution, releasing Ca2+ cations, \n\nand given the hygroscopic nature of lignocellulosic fibres, Ca absorption by plant tissues is likely as \n\nwell as an alkalinity increase in the cell walls. Although higher concentrations of Portlandite in liquid \n\nphase (about 25%) are reached during the early hours of the hydration process (TAYLOR, 1997), \n\nportlandite remains in large proportions in the matrix for a certain period of time depending on the \n\nrapidity of  pozzolanic and carbonation reactions.  \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\n \n\nRegarding fibre treatments, this alternative would reduce the economic and environmental \n\nadvantage of using cellulose-based fibres as reinforcement in FRCC. In this sense, cellulose-based \n\nmaterials bring limited improvement compared to PVA and PP fibres. \n\n \n\n1.6 LOW-ALKALINITY MATRIX COMPOSITES BASED ON MAGNESIUM OXIDE CEMENT \n\nIn order to avoid direct contact between fibres and the high alkalinity water occluded within \n\nthe matrix, this work explores the replacement of PC by a fast setting and lower alkalinity alternative \n\nbinder:  magnesium (Mg) based cement. The main advantage of using this type of cement is that \n\nthe amount of Ca compounds is insignificant in its composition. Therefore, the reduction of Ca(OH)2 \n\nin the hardened binder is utterly solved. \n\n \n\n1.6.1  Mg in low-alkalinity hydraulic binders \n\nMgO based cement, also known as reactive magnesia cements, may be described as \n\ncementitious materials in which composition MgO is used.  \n\nMg is the eighth most abundant element in the solar system and constitutes about 2% of \n\nEarth crust. It is also the third most abundant element in solution in seawater, with a concentration \n\nof about 1300 ppm. However, MgO, or also known as magnesia or periclase, is not obtained by \n\ndirect mining due to its scarcity on Earth crust. The most important rock-forming minerals containing \n\nmagnesium are chlorites, pyroxene and amphibole group minerals, dolomites, and magnesium \n\ncalcites (calcite with some of the Ca replaced by Mg). Mg is also present in magnesite (MgCO3), \n\nnesquehonite (MgCO3.3H2O), lansfordite (MgCO3.5H2O) and brucite [Mg(OH)2]. In addition, there is \n\na series of basic hydrated magnesium carbonates having the empirical formula \n\nxMgCO3.yMg(OH)2.zH2O. These include hydromagnesite 4MgCO3.Mg(OH)2.4H2O and artinite \n\nMgCO3.Mg(OH)2.3H2O. Magnesium also occurs in salt deposits such as carnallite (KMgCl3.6H2O), \n\nepsomite (MgSO4.7H2O) and kieserite (MgSO4.H2O).  \n\nIt has been estimated that the total mass of the sedimentary layer in Earth\u2019s crust is 1.4x1018 \n\ntonnes (WEDEPHOL, 1969). Carbonate rocks constitute about 8wt% of the total sediments \n\n(GOLDSCHMIDT, 1954). Magnesite (MgCO3) is the magnesium end member of an isomorphous \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\n \n\nseries of carbonates. Hereafter, this study focuses on the use of MgO from MgCO3 thermal \n\ndecomposition, as follows: \n\nMgCO3\n>600oC\n?      MgO+CO2 \n\n(9) \n\n \n\n1.6.2   Mg carbonate cements \n\nMgCO3 calcination according to (9) is reversible and it is possible to obtain a hydraulic binder \n\nthrough this opposite reaction called carbonation. Carbonation is also possible in an aqueous \n\nenvironment, which previously hydrates MgO to form Mg(OH)2 and at last forms a Hydrated \n\nMagnesium Carbonate (HMC), with the generic form of xMgCO3.yMg(OH)2.zH2O.  \n\nMgO+H2O ? ?\u00b7Mg(OH)2 +?\u00b7CO2 ? xMgCO3.yMg(OH)2.zH2O (10) \n\n \n\nThese HMC are the main binder component of this type of cement (LISKA; AL-TABBAA, \n\n2009). This attempt of introducing Mg as a binding system was initially explored to reduce PC \n\ncontent in cementitious systems. However, this application is out of the purpose pursued by using \n\nMgO for composites reinforced with lignocellulosic fibres. Based on the results obtained from this \n\nexperience, this HMC system is effective when the cement to aggregates ratio is too low (0.1), in \n\nwhich case compressive strength is even higher than PC. Nevertheless, since this system is based on \n\ncarbonation, similar handicaps found in PC carbonation may arise for this innovative system, where \n\nhigher cement to aggregates ratios result into less porous matrices that difficult carbonation \n\nprocess. \n\n \n\n1.6.3 Magnesium oxide (MgO) based cements \n\nThe origin of magnesia cement, in 1867, was magnesium oxychloride cement (MOC), \n\nobtained from the reaction between MgO and an aqueous magnesium chloride (MgCl2) solution. \n\nThe main bonding phases found in this hardened system are Mg(OH)2, 5Mg(OH)2.MgCl2.8H2O (5-\n\nform) and 3Mg(OH)2.MgCl2.8H2O (3-form) (SHAND, 2006). This material is widely known as Sorel \n\ncement, but it is not the only type of magnesia cement. Magnesium oxychloride cement has not \n\nremained popular in the building industry is that the magnesium oxychloride phase is not stable in \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\n \n\nprolonged contact with water, which will result in the leaching of magnesium chloride from the \n\ncement phase, leaving Mg(OH)2 behind as the binder. Since Mg(OH)2 does not have adequate \n\nstrength, the cement bond as a whole is severely weakened. \n\nIn the literature it is been reported two other well-known magnesia cements. The first is \n\nmagnesium oxysulfate (MOS), which is the sulphate analogous of magnesium oxychloride and is \n\nformed by the reaction between Mg and magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) in an aqueous solution. Four \n\noxysulfate phases are formed at temperatures between 30 and 120oC: Mg(OH)2.MgSO4.3H2O (5-\n\nform), 3Mg(OH)2.MgSO4.8H2O (3-form), Mg(OH)2.MgSO4.5H2O, and Mg(OH)2.2MgSO4.3H2O. Only \n\nthe 3-form and 5-form are stable at 25oC (SHAND, 2006). This cement has the same lack of water \n\nresistance as MOC cement. \n\nThe second is magnesium phosphate cement (MAP), formed by the reaction between MgO \n\nand a soluble phosphate, such as dibasic ammonium phosphate (NH4H2PO4). The main phases \n\nreported in this cement are struvite (NH4MgPO4\u00b76H2O), newberyite (MgHPO4\u00b73H2O), hannayite \n\n[(NH4)2Mg3H4(PO4)4\u00b78H2O], schertelite [(NH4)2MgH2(PO4)2\u00b74H2O], dittmarite (NH4MgPO4\u00b7H2O), \n\nstercorite (NaNH4HPO4\u00b74H2O) and struvite-K (MgKPO4\u00b76H2O) (WALLING; PROVIS, 2016). Similarly to \n\nwhat happens to MOC and MOS, the reaction between MgO and phosphoric acid results in a water-\n\nsoluble cementitious mass, this type of cement has no practical use after ageing. \n\n \n\n1.6.4 Magnesium oxide (MgO) and silica (SiO2) based cements \n\nA different solution becomes possible where Ca chemistry is replaced by Mg, and the \n\ncement is produced by combining reactive MgO and highly amorphous SiO2 to form magnesium \n\nsilicate hydrate (M-S-H in cement chemistry nomenclature, M: MgO; S: SiO2; H: H2O) (SZCZERBA et \n\nal., 2013; JIN; AL-TABBAA, 2014; LI et al., 2014; ZHANG; VANDEPERRE; CHEESEMAN, 2014; WALLING \n\net al., 2015). Whereas this type of cement historically attracted limited interest, during the last \n\ndecade it has attracted research interest. In initial studies of this system, a great amount of bonding \n\nM-S-H was achieved with satisfactory mechanical properties (JIANGXIONG; YIMIN; YONGXIN, 2006).  \n\nApart from the potentially suitable mechanical performance of this material, the present \n\nthesis is mainly interested in a different characteristic, its lower alkalinity (pH<11) (ZHANG; \n\nCHEESEMAN; VANDEPERRE, 2011). In accordance with different studies, after evaluating MgO-\n\n\n\n38 \n \n\n \n\nbased cements alkalinity, pH values are below 11 before 7 days and around 10 after 14 days. \n\nAccording to the wide collection of studies about fibres degradation processes and the mechanisms \n\nthat lead to the loss of mechanical properties of the fibres as cement reinforcement, using MgO-\n\nbased cements provides potential and less aggressive environments than PC, where pH is above \n\n12.5 from the very early stages of hydration. \n\nAnother aspect to be considered to protect fibres against environmental humidity variations \n\nis the use of lowest permeability matrices. This aim could be achieved by using lower porosity \n\nmatrices, restricting humidity variations from the outside environment. In this case MgO-based \n\ncement seems to have a higher apparent density (KRYSZTAFKIEWICZ et al., 2004). \n\n \n\n1.7 CLARIFYING REMARKS ABOUT THIS WORK \n\nA MgO and SiO2 hydraulic binding system is applied in this work in order to assess its real \n\npotential to obtain long term durable FRCC completely reinforced with lignocellulosic elements. \n\nAccording to the previous reasons above offered, cellulose-based reinforcing elements in FRCC \n\nbecome a promising option to develop a beneficial technology from an economic, environmental \n\nand social point of view. Nonetheless, some clarifying remarks are presented for a better \n\nunderstand the initial intention, possible limitations and solutions for future studies. \n\n \n\n1.7.1 Use of reactive MgO from MgCO3 thermal decomposition \n\nThe first point addressed is the calcination process of MgCO3. MgO used for this work is \n\nprovided by Magnesita SA, South America\u2019s leading producer of dead-burn and caustic-calcined \n\nmagnesia as well as refractory products. Production of magnesite is almost entirely centred on the \n\ndeposits around Brumado, located in Brazilian south-western Bahia State. Magnesita has the \n\ncapacity to produce around 2.7 Mt of unburnt magnesite a year as well as 272,000 tonnes/year of \n\ndead-burned magnesite, although current production levels are about 231,000 tonnes per annum. \n\nCaustic calcined magnesite output is around 41,000 tonnes per year. The major commercial deposit \n\nof crystalline magnesite is in the area of Serra das \u00c9guas, where the magnesite occurs as bladelike \n\naggregates and euhedral crystals. Magnesite also occurs as massive aggregates, which comprises \n\nthe commercial ore. This ore ranges in colour from white to a red-orange owing to the presence of \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\n \n\na finely divided hematite. The most typical is fine- to medium-grained white or light gray magnesite. \n\nThe formation of this deposit is thought to have involved magnesium-bearing solutions depositing \n\nmagnesite as a replacement of dolomite and altering quartz to enstatite and talc (SHAND, 2006). \n\nThe essential reaction that occurs during MgCO3 heating is the loss of carbon dioxide from \n\nmagnesite, with the corresponding formation of magnesium oxide; see (9). The full decomposition \n\nof 1.0 kg of pure magnesite yields 0.48 kg magnesium oxide and 0.52 kg of carbon dioxide. \n\nTherefore, it will require 2.08 kg of pure magnesite to yield 1.0 kg of magnesium oxide. \n\nAccording to SimaPro 8 database, used to calculate impact assessment results: \n\n? Total mining and transport of raw materials related CO2 emissions = 0.01-0.015 t CO2/t MgO \n\n? Total electricity or fuel related CO2 emissions = 0.13-0.15 t CO2/t MgO \n\n Also from stoichiometry, the CO2 released during calcination process of magnesite to \n\nmagnesium oxide is approximately 1.09 t CO2/t MgO. \n\nAltogether, a total value of approximately 1.23-1.26 t CO2/t MgO are released to the \n\natmosphere. \n\nComparing CO2 emission values to those for Portland cement (0.9-1t CO2/t MgO) (GARTNER, \n\n2004; BARCELO et al., 2014), MgO production may be considered as more pollutant option. \n\nNevertheless, the proposed binder system is a blend of MgO and SiO2 based materials that could \n\nresult in much reduced emission per tonne of binder. According to literature, up to 50% of the \n\nbinding system may be constituted by SiO2 additions, which could clearly decrease these CO2 \n\nemission figures.  \n\n \n\n1.7.2 Lower carbon alternatives for obtaining reactive MgO \n\nAnother route to obtain reactive MgO was proposed two decades ago (LACKNER et al., \n\n1995). It was suggested a new production technology to obtain MgO from magnesium silicates, MS, \n\n(Figure 7). In accordance with this process magnesium silicates decomposition does not involve any \n\nCO2 chemical emission and only fuel related emission occurs. Thus, only 0.2-0.4 tonnes of CO2 are \n\nemitted for each tonne of MgO produced, reducing considerably the pollutant effect of MgCO3 \n\ncalcination. \n\n\n\n40 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 6- Diagram of the process for magnesium oxide production according to (LACKNER et al., 1995) \n\n \n\nSource: Based on: LACKNER, K. S. et al. Carbon dioxide disposal in carbonate minerals. Energy, London, v. 20, n. 11, p. \n\n1153\u20131170, 1995. \n\n \n\nThe production of reactive MgO from MS was also explored by Novacem Ltd. This former \n\nImperial College London spin-out developed several products regarding Mg-based technology. \n\nAlthough the company liquidation in 2012, Novacem left an intellectual property legacy, currently \n\nin possession of Calix (Australia), that included an improved process for manufacturing MgCO3 from \n\nMS ores by carbonation (i .e. treatment with carbon dioxide and/or carbonic acid H2CO3 at high \n\ntemperature and pressure) (VLASOPOULOS; BERNEBEU, 2014). Very interesting advantages from \n\nthis system are obtained since CO2 is cyclically recovered into the process for raw materials \n\ncarbonation; see Figure 7. Another positive aspect derived from this process is the low temperature \n\ndemand that makes viable the use of fuels with low energy content. Novacem claimed to produce \n\ncarbon negative cement, though it was never industrially upscaled for cement products \n\nmanufacture. Despite the initial shortcomings of Novacem technology (high pressure demand and \n\nhigh degree of milling to process raw materials), this approach has been pointed out as energy-\n\ncompetitive with PC (GARTNER; HIRAO, 2015), though more research was essential to develop viable \n\nMg-based cement.   \n\nHCl\n\nMagnesium silicates\n\n(xMgO.ySiO2.zH2O)\n\nMgCl2 .nH2O\n\nHeat\n\n(150oC)\n\nMg(OH)Cl\n\nMg(OH)2\n\nMgO\n\nHeat\n\n(650oC)\n\nH2O\n\nMgCl2\n\nHCl\n\nMagnesium silicates\n\n(xMgO.ySiO2.zH2O)\n\nMgCl2 .nH2O\n\nHeat\n\n(150oC)\n\nMg(OH)Cl\n\nMg(OH)2\n\nMgO\n\nHeat\n\n(650oC)\n\nH2O\n\nMgCl2\n\n\n\n41 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 7- Summarized process of MgCO3 production according to (VLASOPOULOS; BERNEBEU, 2014) \n\n \n\nSource: Based on VLASOPOULOS, N.; BERNEBEU, J. P. Production of magnesium carbonate. [s.l.]: Google Patents, 2014.  \n\n \n\n1.7.3 Use of reactive SiO2 \n\nIn this work, reactive SiO2 is obtained from silica fume (SF). This SF is U920, provided by \n\nElkem Materials South America Ltda, Diadema, SP, Brazil. SF is widely reported to be very effective \n\npozzolan material (ZELI? et al., 2000; ROY; ARJUNAN; SILSBEE, 2001; WONG; ABDUL RAZAK, 2005). \n\nSF, also called microsilica, (CAS number 69012-64-2, EINECS number 273-761-1) is an amorphous \n\n(non-crystalline) polymorph of SiO2. This spherical shaped mineral, with an average diameter of \n\n0.15?m, is obtained as a by-product of the silicon and ferrosilicon alloy production. After years of \n\nexperience, SF is not considered as a waste product any longer and it is widely employed as an \n\nessential compound to produced high strength cements. With time, SF pirce has arisen and it is not \n\nan economic option to produce FRCC. However, SF is chosen since its pozzolanic nature is broadly \n\nunderstood as well as its homogeneity facilitates a better reproducibility of laboratory scale tests. \n\nOne more interesting aspect to be considered from Novacem technique (Figure 7) is the \n\nproduction of SiO2 as a by-product from the carbonation process of MS, according to (11). This SiO2, \n\nwhen amorphous and finely obtained is the second mineral necessary to produce the previously \n\n\n\n42 \n \n\n \n\nmentioned cement based on MgO-SiO2. Therefore, MgO-SiO2 cement has a promising route to go \n\nfollow the initial steps made by this company. \n\nMg2SiO4 +2CO2 ? 2MgCO3 +SiO2 (11) \n\n \n\n1.7.4 Dewatering-pressing moulding technique (DPM) \n\nIn front of all the possibilities given by the use of MgO-SiO2 and cellulose-based fibres, this \n\nthesis focuses on the production of FRCC moulded following a dewatering-pressing moulding, DPM, \n\ntechnique.  \n\nBased on the scientific career of the supervisor of this thesis \n\n(lattes.cnpq.br/4108663280979993) and his renowned success in introducing cellulose-based \n\nelements in FRCC by DPM, this method becomes as the most suitable solution to produce the \n\nspecimens tested during this work. For a clear assessment of the durability of these composites, the \n\nproduced FRCC uses only lignocellulosic reinforcement from paper pulping. \n\nThis moulding process is an adaptation of the Hatschek process to a laboratory scale, \n\ndisplayed in Figure 8. The Hatschek process involves the production of fibre cement by overlaying \n\nthin sheets made of a mixture of cementitious binders, fibres, aggregates and water. Thin sheets of \n\nfibre cement are obtained by retention of solid materials during filtration in rotary sieves, which are \n\nlater transferred and accumulated in a cylindrical press, to obtain the desired thickness. The \n\ncellulose fibres have an essential role in this process, since they constitute the network of fibres that \n\ntrap suspended solids during filtration. The adaptation of the Hatschek process to a DPM has been \n\nsuccessfully reproduced and described (DIAS; SAVASTANO JR.; JOHN, 2010). With this adaptation, \n\nDPM allows to obtain very thin materials that simplicities the flexural performance analysis of the \n\ncomposites since insignificant compressive contribution of the cement is produced under bending \n\ntests. \n\n\n\n43 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 8- Scheme of laboratory scale of DPM  process. (a) slurry stirring, mixture of cement, fibres and aggregates in \nwater; (b) transfer to a moulding chamber; (c) composite casting; (d) dewatering by vacuum and tamping by low \n\nhydraulic pressing ; (e) finished upper surface and (f) composite compaction by high hydraulic pressing \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\nConsidering the hydration reaction of MgO to form Mg(OH)2 (12), to hydrate 1g of MgO it is \n\nneeded approximately 0.4467g of H2O. However, due to the high specific surface area of reactive \n\nMgO, more water is required to promote a dissolving-precipitating process until total MgO is \n\nhydrated, as well as extra water is required for a minimum flowability in order to assure a good \n\ncasting. At this point DPM also results favourable since this process introduces an initial extra \n\namount of water for the composite casting and later removes it. In the case of Mg-based materials \n\nthis is of importance since no additive is required for moulding. \n\nMgO+H2O ? Mg(OH)2 (12) \n\n \n\n \n\n1.8 STRUCTURE OF THE THESIS \n\nThe present work is composed of 5 different experimental studies as displayed in Figure 9. \n\nEach experimental work is considered as an independent block.  \n\nThe whole study has been structured in three main experimental stages, as depicted in \n\nFigure 9: \n\n\n\n44 \n \n\n \n\n1) Optimization of the MgO-SiO? binding system for FRCC production with cellulosic reinforcing \n\nelements  (Block 1) \n\n2) Durability studies (Block 2 and Block 5). Analysis of the different aspects of the cellulose based \n\nreinforcing elements durability. While Block 2 assesses the durability of lignocellulosic elements \n\nintroduced as pulp to reinforce thin plates, along with the analysis of the composites mechanical \n\nperformance before and after ageing, Block 5 only focuses on the durability of macrofibres in terms \n\nof chemical integrity before and after time when are embedded in cement matrices.  \n\n3) FRCC optimization studies (Block 3 and Block 4). Introduction of two different routes to improve \n\nMgO-SiO2 systems: the use of different curing treatments to promote carbonation of Mg hydrates \n\ncompounds (Block 3) and the incorporation of magnesium silicate hydrates additives to improve \n\ncomposite performance (Block 4). \n\nPart of Block 4 and Block 5 were developed in Spain, at the Department of Chemestry \n\nEngineering of Universidad Complutense de Madrid and at the Institute of Materials Technology of \n\nUniversitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia respectively. \n\n\n\n45 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 9- Flowchart representing the workflow of the thesis according the work carried out in the different chapters \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\n1.9 AIM OF THE DIFFERENT BLOCKS \n\n1.9.1 BLOCK 1  \n\nOptimization of the MgO-SiO? binding system for FRCC production with cellulosic reinforcing \n\nelements \n\nThis block has been adapted from: (M\u00c1RMOL et al., 2016). Every Table and Figure has \n\nbeen adapted from this only source. \n\nA range of MgO and SiO2 blends mixed with water is analysed to develop clinker-free Fibre \n\nReinforced Cementitious Composites (FRCC) products reinforced with cellulosic fibres. For FRCC \n\nproduction, particularly in the case of fibre-cement products, it is necessary to understand the early \n\nproperties of the binding matrix, since rapid development of rigidity (in the first week of age) is \n\nrequired during the production and stock process. For this reason, this chapter assesses the \n\nhydration evolution from 7 to 28 days of different MgO-SiO2 formulations simulating the fibre-\n\n\n\n46 \n \n\n \n\ncement manufacture conditions. Hence, the optimal dosage by a compromise solution between the \n\nlowest alkalinity (from mixing until 28 days) and the highest mechanical performance (at 7 and 28 \n\ndays) is chosen. \n\n1.9.2 BLOCK 2 \n\nStudy of the degradation of FRCC with MgO-SiO? cement matrix reinforced with cellulosic \n\nreinforcing elements \n\nThis block has been adapted from: (M\u00c1RMOL; SAVASTANO, 2017). Every Table and Figure \n\nhas been adapted from this only source. \n\nThis block assesses the use of low alkaline composites based on magnesium oxide and silica \n\n(MgO-SiO2) cement and reinforced with cellulose fibres for the production of thin FRCC to resist \n\nbending loads. The strategy adopted aims to study the durability of lignocellulosic fibres in a lower \n\npH environment than the ordinary Portland cement (PC) by comparing the flexural performance of \n\nsamples at 28 days and after 200 accelerated ageing cycles (aac). Furthermore, apparent porosity \n\n(AP), bulk density (BD) and water absorption (WA) are assessed both at 28 days and after 200 aac. \n\nTwo types of vegetable fibres are utilised: eucalyptus and pine pulps. \n\n1.9.3 BLOCK 3 \n\nEffect of carbonation curing on FRCC based on MgO-SiO? systems \n\nHigh CO2 concentration environment is evaluated as a curing treatment in order to optimise \n\nMg-based cementitious matrices in FRCC. Thin FRCC made out of MgO-SiO2 binding systems and \n\nreinforced with polypropylene (PP) and cellulosic (pine) pulp, are produced by a Dewatering \n\nPressing Moulding (DPM) technique are mechanically and physically characterized. Samples are \n\ncured under two different conditions: 1) steam water curing at 55oC and 2) a complementary high \n\nCO2 concentration (20% by volume). To evaluate the mechanical performance of the MgO-SiO2 \n\ncement and the possibility to be fibre reinforced, 4 point-bending test is used. In addition, apparent \n\nporosity (AP), bulk density (BD) and water absorption (WA) are assessed. In order to study the \n\neffects of carbonation on the materials, and their performance over time, cycles of accelerated \n\nageing are used. At this point, PP fibres are introduced along with lignocellulosic fibres in this thesis \n\nsince they are longer fibres, and therefore yield better energy dispersion by pull-out. Higher energy \n\n\n\n47 \n \n\n \n\ndispersion samples facilitate the evaluation of the CO2 curing treatment and its effects on FRCC. Also \n\nthe thermodynamic stability of the possible obtained HMC on the matrix is confirmed. \n\n1.9.4 BLOCK 4 \n\nEffect of sepiolite addition on FRCC based on MgO-SiO? systems \n\nThe addition of sepiolite in FRCC is analysed as a possible additive constituent of the binding \n\nmatrix. With the intention of optimising the Mg-SiO2 cementitious system in FRCC, small cement \n\nreplacement (1 and 2% wt.) by sepiolite is introduced in the composites so its effects are studied, \n\nfirstly, in hardened cement pastes and, later, in FRCC systems. When used only in cement pastes, \n\nnon-destructive studies are used to assess flexural performance over time as well as the possible \n\nreactivity between additive and cement. When sepiolite is introduced in FRCC, the properties of the \n\nslurry suspensions are evaluated to understand its interference in the Dewatering Pressing \n\nMoulding (DPM) process and, finally, flexural tests are carried out to understand the outcome of \n\nthis additive on the mechanical performance of the composite. \n\n1.9.5 BLOCK 5 \n\nStudy of the degradation of sisal fibres in MgO-SiO? cement matrices compared to degradation \n\nin PC matrices \n\nAfter proving that cellulose microfibres do not suffer any chemical degradation, when used \n\nin thin FRCC made out of MgO-SiO2 cement, it becomes essential to understand the behaviour of \n\nmacrofibres when submitted to the same conditions. Although this thesis only focuses on the \n\nperformance of the FRCC produced by DPM, it becomes necessary to evaluate the real potential of \n\nall types of cellulosic fibres in order to obtain different types of FRCC, especially those reinforced \n\nwith longer fibres. In this sense, the comparative study of fibre degradation when applied in \n\ndifferent cementitious systems, MgO-SiO2 and PC, reveals the real compatibility of lignocellulosic \n\nfibres and Mg-based cement. Since several authors have broadly used sisal to reinforce PC \n\ncomposites and its deterioration has been well reported, this type of fibre has been selected to \n\nassess its integrity over time in MgO-SiO2 systems. \n\n \n\n\n\n48 \n \n\n \n\n2 LITERATURE REVIEW \n\nThe use of lignocellulosic fibres in FRCC  was proposed ever since the production of \n\nasbestos-free fibre-cement became a key challenge from a technical point of view (COUTTS, 2005). \n\nAt present, necessity for new fibre cement technologies is increasing to attend the huge demand \n\nthat exists in both developing countries and more industrialized areas. It has increasingly become a \n\nvery interesting material as reinforcement element for FRCCs, e.g. flat sheets, roofing and siding \n\nshingles, and clapboards, due to their excellent mechanical properties (ARDANUY; CLARAMUNT; \n\nTOLEDO FILHO, 2015). Many other types of fibres present a remarkable potential as reinforcement \n\nelements in cementitious products i.e. carbon (BAEZA et al., 2013; SHU et al., 2015), synthetic \n\npolymers (HAN et al., 2012), rubber (GUPTA; CHAUDHARY; SHARMA, 2016), glass fibre reinforced \n\nplastic (ASOKAN; OSMANI; PRICE, 2009) or steel (MADANDOUST et al., 2015; SENARATNE et al., \n\n2016). In spite of their suitable properties, these synthetic fibres introduce an extra cost in the \n\nproduction of FRCC and likewise are not the best option from an environmental point of view \n\n(TONOLI et al., 2010).  On the other hand , lignocellulosic fibres, when used with Portland cement, \n\nundergo alkaline degradation leading to deterioration in flexural properties over time. Vegetable \n\nfibres can suffer various degrees of degradation when exposed to an alkaline environment and this \n\ndegradation is especially manifested when fibres are exposed to alkaline environments which are \n\nalso rich in Ca2+ (TOLEDO FILHO et al., 2000).  \n\nThe degradation of lignocellulosic fibres is thoroughly described (MELO FILHO; SILVA; \n\nTOLEDO FILHO, 2013), though the mechanism of degradation becomes difficult to establish since it \n\nincludes three combined factors on the deterioration of sisal fibre (WEI; MEYER, 2014):  \n\n(i) Alkaline pore water, from cement hydration, dissolves the amorphous materials of \n\nfibre, such as waxes, fats, hemicelluloses and lignin, which are susceptible to both \n\nCa(OH)2 and high alkalinity attack and can be disintegrated in alkali environment. This \n\ndeclines the linkage between individual fibre cells, leading to the decrease of tensile \n\nstrength;  \n\n(ii) alkaline hydrolysis of cellulose molecules, which generates a rupture between \n\nmolecular chains and so a reduction in degree of polymerization and lower tensile \n\nstrength, since the strength of fibre mainly depends on the content of crystalline \n\ncellulose; and  \n\n\n\n49 \n \n\n \n\n(iii) crystallization of lime in the lumen, walls of the individual fibres and middle lamellae \n\nyielding a reduction in the fibre flexibility and strength, which is also known as fibre \n\nmineralization process.  \n\n \n\nMany attempts to solve this inconvenience have been explored effectively, improving fibre \n\nintegrity after ageing, although far from achieving a completely successful solution. So far, all the \n\ntechniques used to improve vegetable fibre durability in Portland cement are based on the \n\nreduction of portlandite, by the use of highly reactive pozzolans (BEZERRA et al., 2006; M\u00c1RMOL et \n\nal., 2013; PEREIRA et al., 2013) and carbonation (ALMEIDA et al., 2013; PIZZOL et al., 2014; SANTOS \n\net al., 2015a). However, these methods rely on chemical reactions which take place gradually rather \n\nthan immediately, and this means that the vegetable fibres are surrounded by high concentrations \n\nof Ca(OH)2 in the initial stages, which may be deleterious for reinforcing performance (TOLEDO \n\nFILHO et al., 2000). \n\nA different solution becomes possible where Ca chemistry is replaced by Mg, and the \n\ncement is produced by combining reactive MgO and highly amorphous SiO2 to form magnesium \n\nsilicate hydrate (M-S-H in cement chemistry nomenclature, M: MgO; S: SiO2; H: H2O) (SANDBERG; \n\nMOSBERG, 1989). In initial studies of this system, a great amount of bonding M-S-H is achieved with \n\nsatisfactory mechanical properties (SANDBERG; MOSBERG, 1989). Whereas this type of cement \n\nhistorically attracted limited interest, during the last decade it has become an attractive alternative \n\nto Portland cement due to its properties: low alkalinity (pH &lt;11) (ZHANG; CHEESEMAN; \n\nVANDEPERRE, 2011; WALLING et al., 2015) and potentially good mechanical performance \n\n(JIANGXIONG; YIMIN; YONGXIN, 2006; ZHANG; VANDEPERRE; CHEESEMAN, 2014). \n\nThe better understanding of this new fibre-cement product is crucial for the manufacture \n\nof more sustainable building materials since cellulosic fibres are biodegradable, renewable, demand \n\nlow processing energy and are available around the world at lower rates with diversity of \n\nmorphologies and dimensions (SANTOS et al., 2015b). In addition, MgO-SiO2 cements assessed in \n\nthis thesis, in contrast to Portland cement, which requires high temperatures (about 1450oC) during \n\nits production, demand less energy [750oC is the maximum temperature for the controlled \n\ncalcination to obtain reactive MgO from MgCO3 (SHAND, 2006)]. This alternative cement, would also \n\nallow the reuse of agro-industrial residues in to obtain amorphous silica (ANTIOHOS; PAPADAKIS; \n\nTSIMAS, 2014), becoming a more efficient cement from the environmental point of view. \n\n\n\n50 \n \n\n \n\nNew types of cement as magnesium oxysulfate (MOS) cements have been successfully used \n\nto prevent cellulosic fibres degradation over time (GOMES; CAMARINI, 2014). However, the \n\nmechanical results of this new kind of cement are far from those obtained with Portland cement \n\nproducts. Besides MOS cement is known to have leaching problems with time (SHAND, 2006). A new \n\ntype of magnesia cement is presented for the production of FRCC elements from the combination \n\nof MgO and reactive SiO2 (MgO-SiO2 cement).   \n\nAccelerated carbonation has been shown to be capable of improving cementitious matrices \n\nfor fibre cement applications (ALMEIDA et al., 2013; PURNELL; SHORT; PAGE, 2001; PURNELL et al., \n\n2003; PIZZOL et al., 2014; SANTOS et al., 2015a). The main effect of carbonation on hydrated \n\nPortland cement paste is the conversion of portlandite (Ca(OH)2) into calcite (CaCO3). This reaction \n\nincreases the density of the matrix, (FR\u00cdAS; GO\u00d1I, 2013; MO; ZHANG; DENG, 2015; MORANDEAU; \n\nTHI\u00c9RY; DANGLA, 2015; ZHA et al., 2015), making it more rigid and stronger. It also strengthens the \n\nfibre-matrix interface, but this can modify the fracture mechanism, often leading to a reduction in \n\nthe energy absorbed during a flexural test, despite significant increases in the modulus of rupture \n\n(MOR) and modulus of elasticity (MOE) (PURNELL; SHORT; PAGE, 2001; ALMEIDA et al., 2013; PIZZOL \n\net al., 2014; SANTOS et al., 2015a).  \n\nReactive periclase binders can also harden by carbonation, sequestering CO2 as part of the \n\nprocess of making construction materials (UNLUER; AL-TABBAA, 2013, 2014, 2015; VANDEPERRE; \n\nAL-TABBAA, 2007). When MgO is carbonated in the presence of water, HMC are produced, with \n\ngeneral formula xMgCO3.Mg(OH)2.yH2O, (HMC) (BOTHA; STRYDOM, 2001; LANAS; ALVAREZ, 2004). \n\nThese compounds bind both water and CO2 and thus create a very large additional solid volume, \n\ngiving them a much greater potential than Portland cement in terms of overall binder efficiency. \n\nThe transformation of brucite into HMC, identically to what occurs for Ca(OH)2 when turns into \n\n(CaCO3), increases strength of the hydrated pastes.  \n\nOne more particular benefit for carbonating MgO cements is the higher water demand of \n\nthis types of cements compared to Portland cement (ZHANG; VANDEPERRE; CHEESEMAN, 2014). \n\nThis higher water demand implies a more porous matrix and therefore facilitates the transportation \n\nof CO2 trough the matrix. In addition to generating porous matrices, the high water demand of MgO \n\ncements also creates favorable conditions for the carbonation of Mg(OH)2 since a previous \n\nrequirement for the formation of HMC is the dissolution of CO2 in water to form carbonic acid \n\n(H2CO3) (VANDEPERRE; AL-TABBAA, 2007). This factor has to be considered in the production of \n\n\n\n51 \n \n\n \n\nfibre-cement as the possible addition of cellulosic fibres would increase the amount of water within \n\nthe matrix after reinforcement dry due to the hygroscopic nature of vegetal fibres (ONUAGULUCHI; \n\nBANTHIA, 2016).  The release of water from vegetable fibres would increase the capillary water, \n\nfavouring the generation of H2CO3 and promoting carbonation. \n\nAnother aspect to be analysed is the condition for carbonation to be effective. Up to now \n\nthe best results to accelerate carbonation on Portland cement are those achieved by supercritical \n\ncarbonation (PURNELL; SHORT; PAGE, 2001; SANTOS et al., 2015a). From a technical point of view, \n\nsupercritical carbonation requires high energy to reach the critical point (pressure of at least 7.38 \n\nMPa) as well as additional sophisticated chambers to resist those reactor conditions. However, for \n\nHMC, it is not necessary supercritical fluids for carbonation in order to accelerate the carbonation \n\nreaction. This factor makes feasible the production of carbonated products with simpler \n\ntechnologies that exclusively require higher concentration of CO2.  \n\nAlthough all the mentioned advantages of carbonating MgO-SiO2 systems, a debate has \n\nbeen settled recently regarding the thermodynamic stability of the produced phases as a \n\nconsequence of carbonation (UNLUER; AL-TABBAA, 2013, 2016; WALLING; PROVIS, 2016). This \n\nfactor requires a special attention and discussion to determine the viability of this new type of \n\ncement to be reinforced with cellulosic reinforcements. \n\nSepiolite is a clay with a very characteristic fibrous structure with an empirical formula of \n\nSi6Mg4O15(OH)2\u00b76H2O. This mineral has a wide range of uses due to its sorptive, optical, rheological \n\nand molecular sieve properties.  In cementitious materials, sepiolite is usually utilized as a \n\nrheological additive to enhance their features in both the fresh and the hardened state. Sepiolite \n\nhas a thixotropic character improving workability, adherence to the substrate, pumpability and \n\nsurface finishing (\u00c1LVAREZ et al., 2011). In the case of fibre-cement products, the use of this additive \n\nhas a significant effect as rheological agent. The modification of the rheological properties of the \n\nfibre-cement suspensions entails better fibre distribution and better fine particles retention \n\n(FUENTE et al., 2010). Besides, when sepiolite is used in the fabrication of Portland cement products \n\nreinforced with cellulosic fibres, it enhances interlaminar bonding of the sheets, promotes an \n\nexcellent surface finishing and presents a good compatibility with flocculants of different ionic \n\ncharge and molecular weight (FUENTE et al., 2010; JARABO et al., 2010).  \n\nThe use of sepiolite for fibre-cement applications depends on its surface anionic charge. The \n\nhigher anionic charge affects cement hydration by reducing the extent of oxygen atoms in the \n\n\n\n52 \n \n\n \n\nsepiolite surface with free pairs of electrons to interact with water through hydrogen bonding \n\n(JARABO et al., 2014). The dispersion of sepiolite in fibre-cement is favoured by reducing the anionic \n\ncharge of this material (JARABO et al., 2014). Dispersion of sepiolite is, therefore, related to the \n\nefficiency as rheological agent and as well as inhibitor of expansion cracks (JARABO et al., 2014). \n\nWhen a moderate-to-low anionic charge surface sepiolite is added in fibre-cement suspensions \n\nflexural properties are improved (modulus of rupture, limit of proportionality and specific energy). \n\nHowever this enhancement is not reflected on an improvement of the physical properties (density, \n\nporosity and water absorption) (JARABO et al., 2014). Sepiolite in fibre-cement increases the \n\nstability of the flocs. Besides the higher grade of flocculation of the small particles makes easier the \n\nflow of water through the spaces among the flocs (FUENTE et al., 2010). Sepiolite, when present in \n\nfibre-cement suspensions, competes with the rest of the components (cellulose mainly) to absorb \n\nflocculant (A-PAM), increasing the flocculation efficiency in terms of chord size and stability of the \n\nflocs (JARABO et al., 2010). Likewise, when sepiolite is dispersed in water either with cement or silica \n\nalso improves flocculation by interacting with the flocculant particles (JARABO et al., 2010). \n\nApart from its rheological properties, this clay is also used to reinforce cementitious \n\nmaterials due to its morphology. It is found that the addition of 10% sepiolite fibres enhances the \n\nmechanical properties of the mortar (compressive and bending strengths) compared to the plain \n\nPortland cement samples (KAVAS; SABAH; \u00c7ELIK, 2004). Because of its needle-like shape, with a \n\nlength of 0.2-2.0 mm, a width of 100-300 \u00c5 and a thickness of 50-100 \u00c5, within a cement matrix, \n\nsepiolite fibres fill the pores in the paste. It is also proved that an optimal fibre distribution is \n\nnecessary for a proper linkage of the fibres in the cement matrix (KAVAS; SABAH; \u00c7ELIK, 2004). Also, \n\nbecause of the short length and the random distribution of its microfibres, it has a beneficial effect \n\nto reduce crack width and crack length and shrinkage cracking (KANG; SONG; KIM, 2008) and \n\ndecrease soundness (expansion volume) and leads to a reduced shrinkage (KAVAS; SABAH; \u00c7ELIK, \n\n2004). \n\nIn the case of MgO-SiO2 FRCC with cellulosic materials, all these properties are required. \n\nMoreover, sepiolite has been used in lime mortars due to its absorption properties to act as a water \n\nreservoir in conditions of low humidity (ANDREJKOVIC?OV\u00c1 et al., 2012) which could be \n\nadvantageous to complete hydration of MgO-SiO2 systems that demand higher amounts of water \n\ncompared to Portland cement. In addition, in lime mortars, this mineral addition promotes \n\ninterlocking of mortar components, producing a denser structure and, therefore, improves the \n\n\n\n53 \n \n\n \n\nmechanical properties at later ages. Since one of the main hydration products of MgO-SiO2-H20 \n\nsystems, poorly crystalized magnesium silicate hydrate, has the same chemical composition as \n\nsepiolite, it is expected to create new nucleation links between sepiolite and M-S-H gels. When lime \n\nmortars are improved by the addition of a pozzolan, particularly metakaolin, in addition to \n\nimproving mechanical properties at later ages, adding sepiolite provides a wet environment for \n\nmetakaolin, favoring the pozzolanic activity (ANDREJKOVIC\u00d4V\u00c1, 2011). This reactivity could be \n\ngreater in an Mg rich environment provided during the hydration of MgO-SiO2 systems. \n\n  \n\n\n\n54 \n \n\n \n\n3 MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n3.1 BLOCK 1 \n\nThis work is structured in two different sections. The first step aims to analyze MgO-SiO2 \n\nsystems with different formulations and their hydration reactions in the early stages. The second \n\nstage intends to select the optimal blended system for fibre-cement production according to the \n\nresults of pH and mechanical performance. \n\nThe main target is obtaining hydrated magnesium silicates (M-S-H) gels, intending to obtain \n\nhydration products analogous to those achieved from dicalcium silicate (C2S) and tricalcium silicate \n\n(C3S) hydration, but using magnesium chemistry instead of calcium.  \n\n3.1.1 Materials preparation and characterization \n\nTo achieve this objective, pastes made of a blend of fine powders acted as clinker-free \n\ncement. The two components of this blended cement are reactive magnesium oxide powder, [Q-\n\nMAG-200-AR (AR200)], obtained by controlled calcination of MgCO3 and provided by Magnesita \n\nS.A., Contagem, MG, Brazil, and undensified microsilica powder type 920U with high content of \n\nsilicon dioxide with a typical bulk density of 200-350 kg/m3, provided by Elkem ASA Materials, Sao \n\nPaulo, SP, Brazil. Before mixing with water, ball milling for powder homogenization is carried out at \n\na ball to powder ratio of 2:1 at 1 rpm. The basic properties of these materials are shown in Table 3.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n55 \n \n\n \n\nTable 3- Properties of the raw materials used to produce the blended samples \n\n  MgO SiO2 \n\n  AR200 920U \n\n  Chemical composition (wt.%) \n\nMgO 97.4 0.33 \n\nSiO2 0.1 95.1 \n\nAl2O3&lt;0.10&lt;0.10 \n\nFe2O3 0.34 0.35 \n\nCaO 0.81 0.25 \n\nTiO2&lt;0.10&lt;0.10 \n\nK2O&lt;0.10 0.91 \n\nNa2O&lt;0.10 0.26 \n\nLOI 1.6 1.7 \n\n  Specific gravity (g/cm3) \n\n  3.5 2.3 \n\n  Particle size \n\nD10 (?m) 7.11 11.41 \n\nD50 (?m) 17.41 19.02 \n\nD90 (?m) 64.64 36.99 \n\n  Surface area (m2/g) \n\n  22.7 16.1 \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\nThe initial MgO to SiO2 ratios are analysed according to Table 4. \n\n \n\nTable 4- Different MgO and SiO2 blends analysed in this block \n\nMgO (wt.%) SiO2 (wt.%) \n\n50 50 \n\n60 40 \n\n70 30 \n\n80 20 \n\nSource: Own creation \n\nAs a control cement matrix, High Early Strength Portland Cement is used (CPV-ARI, according \n\nto Brazilian Standards NBR 5733) to compare the pH and compressive strength results. CPV-ARI is \n\nselected because it is mainly constituted of clinker with no mineral additions. This condition is \n\ndesirable to set a baseline for the comparative tests here, since in the case of mineral additions \n\nbeing present a pozzolanic reaction may take place. This may generate a less aggressive \n\nenvironment for lignocellulosic fibres due to the reduction of the portlandite and pH. \n\n \n\n\n\n56 \n \n\n \n\n3.1.2 Test methods \n\nThe evolution of pH over time is measured following the procedures of previous studies \n\n(ZHANG; CHEESEMAN; VANDEPERRE, 2011). 10 g of blended powders according to the formulations \n\nshown in Table 4 are poured into sealed glass beakers containing 100 mL of deionized water, and \n\nstirred. The temperature is kept constant at 30oC. pH measurements are taken 30 min after mixing \n\nthe powders in water, then at 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. For pH measurements a Digimed DM-23 \n\npHmeter, an Ika HS10 magnetic stirrer and an Ika ETS-D5 digital temperature controller are used.  \n\nOne of the criteria to select the best formulation is mechanical performance. In spite of the \n\nneed for a good flexural resistant fibre-cement product, the value that represents cement strength \n\nin a more reliable manner is compressive strength. An adaptation of standardized mortar tests \n\n(ASTM C780-14, 2014) for application to pastes is taken in order to use materials in a more efficient \n\nway as a lower amount of material is required to achieve consistent results.  For every sample, \n\nincluding Portland cement pastes, the water to binder ratio is held constant at 0.50 in order to \n\ncompare mechanical results regardless of water demand. For that purpose, plasticizer (Melflux \n\n2651F provided by Sika) is added to the samples for binary systems. Axial compressive strength is \n\nmeasured at 7 and 28 days (6 replicate cylindrical test samples, 50mm high x 25mm diameter, per \n\ncuring time), performing the test with a 50 kN cell load and a swivel device for a uniform approach \n\nto the upper side of the samples. The deformation rate is 0.3 mm/min. The samples are cured in a \n\nsealed bag and kept in a 95% humidity box. After compressive strength testing, samples are crushed \n\ninto powder and immersed in acetone for 5 days and then dried at 65oC until constant mass. Then, \n\nonly particles through a 63?m size mesh were considered for testing. Hydration is also stopped for \n\nbigger pieces.  Fragments of around 5mm length are embedded in epoxy resin mixed in a 7:1 resin \n\nto hardener ratio and, after hardening, polished with diffent grit size (9, 3 and 1 ?m respectively) \n\nsilicon carbide pads for 6 minutes at 300rpm and 10N\u00b7m.   \n\nMineralogical analysis by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) is carried out using powder \n\nsamples, using an X-ray diffractometer Horiba LA-960, scanning between 5-65o 2? at 10 o/min. \n\nRietveld analysis is performed using PDXL-2 software. Thermogravimetry tests (TG) are conducted \n\nwith a Netzch STA 440 F3 Jupiter instrument in alumina crucibles under atmosphere of nitrogen set \n\nat a flow rate of 60 mL/min, from 25 to 1000 oC at a heating rate of 10 oC/min. In order to replicate \n\nand characterize the expected M-S-H gel, a gel with a Mg/Si molar ratio of 0.50 is synthesized via a \n\nprecipitation method according to prior work (BREW; GLASSER, 2005; ZHANG; VANDEPERRE; \n\n\n\n57 \n \n\n \n\nCHEESEMAN, 2014) using solutions of sodium metasilicate pentahydrate (Na2SiO3\u00b75H2O) and \n\nmagnesium nitrate hexahydrate (Mg(NO3)2\u00b76H2O). This gel is used as a thermogravimetric reference, \n\nwith a low Mg content to avoid Mg(OH)2 contamination via an excess of Mg during the precipitation.   \n\nFor infrared spectroscopy a NEXUS 670 spectrometer from Nicolet Instrument Corporation \n\nis used, observing wavenumbers between 4000 and 400 cm-1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) \n\nimages are collected with a Hitachi TM3000 microscope, and EDS measurements are conducted with \n\na SwiftED3000, Oxford Instruments. The acceleration voltage used for the SEM analysis is 15 kV. \n\n \n\n3.2 BLOCK 2 \n\n3.2.1 Materials preparation and characterization \n\nAn cement matrix (MgO-SiO2 cement) to PC is produced using 60 wt% lightly burned \n\nmagnesium oxide (MgO) and 40wt% silica fume (SF), based on Block 1 results. In order to compare \n\nresults with a reference material, Brazilian ordinary Portland cement (PC) CPV-ARI (high early \n\nstrength), equivalent to Type I as defined in ASTM-C150 (ASTM C150/C150M, 2012) is chosen \n\nbecause of its finer particle size and higher reactivity in comparison to other blended cements \n\navailable in the Brazilian market, apart from the absence of mineral additions. This condition is \n\ndesirable since in case of mineral addition present in the matrix, a pozzolanic reaction may take \n\nplace. This would generate a less aggressive environment for the fibres due to the reduction of the \n\nportlandite and pH. Following the procedure of fibre-cement industry, the cementitious material is \n\nreplaced in 25% by mass of Ita\u00fa limestone, produced by Votorantim Cimentos (Santa Helena, SP, \n\nBrazil). Powder materials properties are summarized in Table 5. This replacement is carried out in \n\norder to reduce the cost of fibre-cement production and improve dimension stability generated by \n\nhigh shrinkage levels due to an excess of cement. For the production of the FRCC, considering the \n\nmost common pulps used by paper industry in Brazil, two different types of fibres are used:  \n\nUnbleached Pine pulp, provided by OJSC Solombala Pulp-and-Paper Mill, Arkhangelsk, Russia, and \n\nBleached Eucalyptus pulp, provided by Fibria, Jacarei, SP, Brazil.

Another interval of 10 min \n\nat room temperature also preceded the subsequent cycle, as recommended by the EN 494:2012 \n\nStandard (EN 494:2012+A1:2015, 2012).

The polished (previously embedded in \n\ncold-setting resin with the same procedured used in Block 1 section 3.1.1) and fractured surfaces of \n\nspecimens resulting from the mechanical tests are examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM) \n\nwith Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), using Quanta 600 FEG (FEI, Eindhoven, the \n\nNetherlands) with an acceleration voltage 15 kV.  \n\n3.3 BLOCK 3 \n\n3.3.1 Materials preparation and characterization \n\nAs previously applied in Block 2, MgO-SiO2 cement is used as a blend of lightly burned MgO \n\n(60%) and silica fume (40%) based on Block 1 results or (M\u00c1RMOL et al., 2016). Based on Block 2, \n\nsection 3.2.2, the cementitious material is replaced in 25% by mass using ground limestone, Ita\u00fa \n\nproduced by Votorantim Cimentos (Santa Helena, SP, Brazil). The properties of MgO, SiO2 and \n\nlimestone used in this research are identical as used in Block 2, section 3.2.1. With the intention of \n\n\n\n62 \n \n\n \n\nreproducing the conditions used by fibre-cement industry, similar mix design is used. As reinforcing \n\nelements both synthetic and vegetable polymeric reinforcements are used. Synthetic reinforcement \n\nconcentration is of 2% by mass of the composite (5.82% by volume). In this study polypropylene \n\n(PP) fibres (H 216, Braskem, with a density of 0.905 g\u00b7cm-3, a flexural modulus -1% secant- of 1.4GPa, \n\ntensile strength of 36MPa and elongation at break of 9%) are used to evaluate their capacity as \n\nalternative reinforcement to polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibres. The use of synthetic fibres in this study \n\nis due to the length of this type of fibres  (around 10 mm). Using longer fibres assures enough \n\nanchorage in case of deficient matrix-fibre adherence. Pine pulp described in Block 2, section 3.2.1 \n\nis used.  Refinement is used to change the morphological properties of the cellulose pulp for a better \n\ncapture of the mineral particles during the drainage of excess water from the pad under formation \n\nin the Hatschek process, improving the adherence of the fibres with the matrix (TONOLI et al., \n\n2009a). \n\nThe formulation of the composites is chosen with the intention of reproducing the \n\nproportions usually utilized by the fibre-cement industry as shown in Table 9. \n\nTable 9- Formulation of the FRCC samples used in Block 3 tests \n\n  Raw materials Amount (% by mass) \n\n Matrix \nMagnesium oxide AR 200 42 \n\nSilica Fume Elkem U920 28 \n\nLimestone Ita\u00fa 25 \n\nCellulosic pulp Unbleached pine pulp (CSF = 36) 3 \n\nSynthetic fibre Polypropylene 2 \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\nSamples for bending and physical tests are produced according to Block 2, section 3.2.3. \n\n \n\n3.3.2 Curing treatments \n\nAccording to Szczerba et al. (2013), MgO-SiO2-H2O systems are highly influenced by curing \n\ntemperature, where hydration reactions are accelerated at temperatures over 30oC. Then, after \n\ninitial curing at 25oC for 24 h in a sealed plastic bag, water steam curing at 55oC for 7 days is applied \n\n(Figure 11). For carbonation curing, after first 24 h, samples are placed in an environmental chamber  \n\n(ESPEC-brand, EPL-4H model) for 48 h with a CO2 concentration of 20% by volume, keeping RH at \n\n90% and temperature at 45oC (Figure 11). This temperature is chosen as higher temperatures \n\n\n\n63 \n \n\n \n\naccelerate the hydration kinetics and consequently would obstruct the diffusion of CO2. After the \n\ncarbonation cycle, a period of 5 days of steam curing at 55oC is carried out (Figure 11). After the \n\nsteam curing for both carbonated and non-carbonated samples, specimens are kept in water for 48 \n\nh to complete saturation for wet flexural and physical tests. \n\nFigure 11- Curing conditions diagram for non-carbonated and carbonated samples \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\n3.3.3 Ageing treatment \n\nAccelerated cycles are used to evaluate the composites performance after ageing. This \n\ntechnique aims to speed up natural weathering using soaking and drying cycles. Accelerated ageing \n\ncycles are described in Block 2, section 3.2.3. Each cycle finishes when one soak and dry is completed \n\nand the samples are submitted to 100 accelerated aging cycles. This ageing treatment is used to \n\nsubmit samples to extreme weathering conditions evaluate thermodynamic stability of HMC.  \n\n \n\n3.3.4 Test methods \n\nFour point bending tests are performed according to Block 2, section 3.2.3. After mechanical \n\ntesting, aliquots of each sample are crushed and immersed in acetone to stop hydration reactions \n\nand later dried at 60oC. Crushed samples are prepared as described in Block 1, section 3.1.1, to \n\nperform X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric characterization at different ages. X-ray \n\ndifractometer Horiba LA-960 (CuK? radiation at a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 30 mA, between \n\n5-65o with a speed of 10o/min) and a Netzch STA 440 F3 Jupiter TG equipment under an inert \n\natmosphere of nitrogen set at a flow rate of 60 mL/min and performed from 25 to 1000oC at a \n\n\n\n64 \n \n\n \n\nheating rate of 10oC/min. The physical properties, bulk density (BD) and water absorption (WA) are \n\nobtained following procedures specified by the ASTM C 1185 Standards (2012)(ASTM C1185-08, \n\n2012). The fractured surfaces of specimens resulting from the mechanical tests are resin coated as \n\ndescribed in Block 1 and examined by backscattered electron microscopy (SEM) and Scanning \n\nElectron Microscopy with X-ray microanalysis (EDS), using Quanta 600 FEG (FEI, Eindhoven, the \n\nNetherlands) with an acceleration voltage of 15 kV. \n\n \n\n3.4 BLOCK 4 \n\n3.4.1 Materials preparation and characterization \n\nIn the present work, two types of cement systems are studied: Portland Cement (CEM I \n\nmeeting EN 197?1:2000 Standard) and the MgO-SiO2 cement employed in Block 2, Block 3 or \n\n(M\u00c1RMOL et al., 2016). Limestone filler (CaCO3) is also used in the compositions for flocculation \n\nstudy to recreate analogous conditions as used in Block 2 and Block 3.

In order to explore this \n\nhypothesis, Scanning Electron Microscopy, X-Ray Diffraction and Thermogravimetry analysis are \n\ncarried out on hardened slurry samples that are also vacuum filtered (500 mm of Hg) after mixing \n\n18.4g of MgO-SiO2 powder in 100 g of water for 5 min. After 10 days of steam curing at 55oC, \n\nhardened paste samples are used for cement characterization.  \n\nFor XRD tests, pastes are finely crushed and sieved, using the particle fraction passing \n\nthrough 63 ?m mesh. X\u2019Pert Pro MPD PANalytical\u2019s X-ray diffractometer is used (Cu Ka radiation of \n\n1.54 \u00c5) to collect data between 5o and 65o. The thermal analysis (TG/DTG) of the samples is carried \n\nout in nitrogen atmosphere (50 mL/min) from 35 to 1000oC using a Seiko Exstar 6000 TGA/DTA \n\nthermobalance. SEM analysis is performed on a JSM 6335F electron microscope, JEOL brand with \n\nan intensity of 10 kV. The effect of sepiolite addition on the flexural performance of the MgO-SiO2 \n\ncement is examined by elastic dynamic modulus (DMOE) analysis as an adaptation of the ASTM \n\nC1548 \u2013 02 (2007) Standard (ASTM C1548 - 02, 2007), using a SONELASTIC\u00ae equipment, ATCP brand, \n\nBrazil . For ultrasound tests, 50 x 40 x 5 mm samples are casted and placed in a steam bath at 55oC \n\nfor curing. DMOE is recorded over time and bulk density after 24 h of curing for every formulation. \n\n\n\n67 \n \n\n \n\nCement replacements of 1 and 2% by mass are used for both types of sepiolite. All samples are \n\nmixed in water (water to binder ratio of 0.5). For MgO-SiO2 samples, 1% by mass of MELFLUX 2651F \n\nsuperplasticizer is used. \n\nIn order to test flocculation for the different suspensions, the procedure detailed by Fuente \n\net al (2010) is applied. This process, summarized in Table 12, is applied by focused beam reflectance \n\nmeasurement technique (FBRM), using a M500L probe (Mettler Toledo, Seatle, USA). Thus, \n\nsuspensions in 400 g of water are produced and analysed, mixing 18.4 g of different powder and \n\npowder-fibre solids in accordance with Table 11. Chord length distribution is recorded over time for \n\nall the compositions. \n\nFor water retention analysis, the method of Fuente et al. (2010) is also considered but the \n\nsaturation in calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2]. In this test, with the aim of obtaining a calcium free \n\nsystem that avoids cellulose degradation (MELO FILHO; SILVA; TOLEDO FILHO, 2013; TOLEDO FILHO \n\net al., 2009) only MilliQ water is used. Subsequently, the different suspensions are submitted to \n\nvacuum drainage at 500 mm of Hg and water retention values are recorded over time to study the \n\neffect of the different sepiolite formulations during this fibre-cement manufacture stage.  \n\nTable 12- Method to assess pure powder and fibre-cement suspensions flocculation: adding sequence and stirring rate \n\nvariations (meeting the process used by Fuente et al.

For fibre-\n\n\n\n68 \n \n\n \n\ncement composites flexural testing, 280 g of solids, meeting the same proportions as noted in Table \n\n11, are used following the DPM technique described in Block 2, section 3.2.2. \n\nAfter compaction, samples are cured for 5 days at 55oC and 90% relative humidity. Then \n\npads are cut into 160 x 40 mm specimens. After 2 days of water immersion for saturated testing, \n\nsamples are tested as indicated in Block 2, section 3.2.3 or (M\u00c1RMOL et al., 2016). The same \n\nprocedure is used to carry out the physical tests in accordance to ASTM C1185-08 (ASTM C1185-08, \n\n2012) Standards. For Scanning Electron Microscopy test, after flexural testing, composite samples \n\nare cut into 1 x 1 x 1 cm cubes and embedded in epoxy resin. SEM samples preparation is conducted \n\nas described in Block 1 section 3.1.1. A Quanta 600 FEG microscope (FEI, Eindhoven, Netherlands) \n\nis used.  \n\nSince the effects of sepiolite addition on PC cement composites reinforced with cellulosic \n\nfibres has been already studied (JARABO et al., 2014), PC are just used as control samples (with no \n\naddition of sepiolite).  \n\n \n\n3.5 BLOCK 5 \n\n3.5.1 Materials preparation and characterization \n\nSisal fibres (Agave sisalana) as harvested in Pocinhos (Para\u00edba, Brazil), were used for this \n\nstudy. Without any treatment, unaged sisal fibres were cut to 4 cm length and individually \n\nembedded in cement paste prisms. For this study, high early strength Portland cement (CPV-ARI \n\naccording to Brazilian Standards, equivalent to Type III as defined in ASTM-C150 (ASTM \n\nC150/C150M, 2012, p. 150) and Mg-SiO2 cement, previously used in Block 2, section 3.2.1.  A water \n\nto cement ratio of 1 was used to assure a proper moulding of the prims and generate an excess of \n\nwater for higher porosity and therefore higher alkaline medium. Two different ageing treatments \n\nwere applied to the cement prisms: 1) 5 months of ageing of the prisms inside a sealed plastic bag \n\nat 25oC and 65% RH and 2) 400 accelerated ageing cycles for a rapid study of a simulated long-term \n\nageing. Accelerated ageing cycles are conducted according to Block 2, section 3.2.3. \n\nAfter these ageing treatments, cement prims were mechanically crushed so fibres were \n\ndetached and then different techniques were used to assess sisal fibres degradation. \n\n\n\n69 \n \n\n \n\n3.5.2 Test methods \n\nThermogravimetric study was performed in a METLER TOLEDO TGA/SDTA851e with \n\nsimultaneous thermal analyser.

The \n\nresulting diffractogram was registered by scanning the samples from 10o to 40o (2?) in 0.02o steps \n\nat a rate of 0.3?/min. \n\n \n\n\n\n70 \n \n\n \n\nThe crystallinity index, Ic(%), was calculated for every treatment also by two different \n\nmethods:  \n\n1) using the equation (22) proposed by Segal (SEGAL et al., 1959): \n\nIc(%) =\nIam\nImax\n\n x 100 (22) \n\n \n\nWhere Imax is the maximum intensity of the (200) lattice reflection of cellulose I? type, \n\nlocated at 2? between 22 and 23?, and Iam is the intensity attributed to amorphous part, given at \n\n2? between 18?and 19? for I??cellulose; and  \n\n2) by dividing the diffractogram area due to crystalline cellulose by the total area of the original \n\ndiffractogram. For this method, amorphous cellulose from the diffractogram of the whole sample \n\nwas subtracted with the aid of TOPAS software in order to establish crystalline fraction (PARK et al., \n\n2010). \n\nThe crystallite size was determined by the Scherrer equation (LANGFORD; WILSON, 1978) \n\naccording to Equation (23), \n\nd =\nk?\n\n?cos?\n (23) \n\n \n\nWhere d is the perpendicular size to the lattice plane represented by the peak (200), k is the \n\nconstant related to the shape of the crystallites and the indices of the reflecting plane, k is the \n\nwavelength of the incident beam in the diffraction experiment, ? is the peak width at half maximum \n\n(PWHM) in radians and ? is the position of the peak (half of the plotted 2 h value). For Scanning \n\nElectron Microscopy (SEM) tests, sisal fibres were embedded in epoxy resin to reproduce the state \n\nof the fibres cross section within a binding material. After resin hardening, samples were firstly \n\npolished with abrasive silicon carbide and then with alumina until smooth surface was achieved. \n\nField emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) ZEISS Brand, ULTRA 55 model, was equipped \n\nwith microanalysis by EDS from Oxford Instruments Ltda. \n\n\n\n71 \n \n\n \n\n4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS \n\n4.1 BLOCK 1 \n\n4.1.1 XRD characterization \n\nIn Figure 12, XRD patterns for all the samples are depicted. For every sample, it can be seen \n\nthat peaks corresponding to brucite have a higher intensity when compared to peaks matching \n\nreflections of periclase. This implies that most of the MgO has either been hydrated to form Mg(OH)2 \n\nor reacted to form M-S-H, with a hydration degree close to completion (up to 98% for samples with \n\nlower MgO content by Rietveld refinement). As expected, formulations with higher contents of MgO \n\nshow more intense peaks corresponding to both periclase and brucite, as there is less opportunity \n\nfor conversion to M-S-H in these instances, and thus a lower degree of reaction. The most \n\nremarkable difference between samples at 7 and 28 days is that the peaks corresponding to \n\npericlase (at 43 and 62o) decrease with time for every system. According to literature (ALI; KOTP; EL-\n\nNAGGAR, 2010; BREW; GLASSER, 2005; JIN; AL-TABBAA, 2014; LOTHENBACH et al., 2015; RASHID et \n\nal., 2009; ROOSZ et al., 2015; SZCZERBA et al., 2013; TEMUUJIN; OKADA; MACKENZIE, 1998, 2005; \n\nZHANG; CHEESEMAN; VANDEPERRE, 2011; ZHANG; VANDEPERRE; CHEESEMAN, 2014), magnesium \n\nsilicate hydrated formed from a mixture of MgO and silica rich powder in the presence of water \n\nshows highly disordered characteristics with broad peaks throughout the diffraction pattern range. \n\nTwo minor, broad peaks are evident here at 33\u201339\u00b0 and 58\u201361\u00b0 2?. Another expected broad peak \n\ncorresponding to magnesium silicate hydrate is supposed to appear between 25-30\u00b0 2??but in this \n\ncase it overlaps with the broad hump due to unreacted silica. These features confirm the presence \n\nof M-S-H gels (ALI; KOTP; EL-NAGGAR, 2010; BREW; GLASSER, 2005; JIN; AL-TABBAA, 2014; \n\nLOTHENBACH et al., 2015; RASHID et al., 2009; ROOSZ et al., 2015; SZCZERBA et al., 2013; \n\nTEMUUJIN; OKADA; MACKENZIE, 2005; WALLING et al., 2015; ZHANG; VANDEPERRE; CHEESEMAN, \n\n2014). \n\n\n\n72 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 12- XRD diffractograms of the different MgO-SIO2 samples at 7 days (left) and at 28 days (right). Peaks marked are \n\nbrucite (?), periclase (?), calcite (C) and magnesite (M) \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\nFigure 13 shows an enlarged view of selected key regions of Figure 12 for every formulation. \n\nParts of the regions where features arising from M-S-H gel are expected have been omitted since \n\nthey overlapped with unreacted silica peaks, so Figure 13 illustrates just the regions where only gel \n\nbumps are manifest (33-37\u00b0 and 59.5-61.5\u00b0 2?). Both regions show a broad hump corresponding to \n\nthe M-S-H gel XRD patterns obtained in previous studies, confirming the presence of the gel. \n\nNevertheless the intensity of these humps is not as high as it is found in previous works. This may \n\nbe explained by the fact that M-S-H gel is not the only main phase present in the matrix, in contrast \n\nto what is intended in previous reports where synthesized magnesium silicate is the only constituent \n\n(BREW; GLASSER, 2005; TEMUUJIN; OKADA; MACKENZIE, 1998; ZHANG; VANDEPERRE; \n\nCHEESEMAN, 2014). In the two regions, between 35-39\u00b0 and 58-61\u00b0 2?, the intensity of the humps \n\nfor most of the formulations is slightly higher for 28 day cured samples, suggesting that the \n\ndevelopment of the gel have been ongoing over time. According to literature Mg(OH)2 content tends \n\nto decrease with time, although there is little systematic variation observed here due to the \n\nreplenishment of Mg(OH)2 by ongoing hydration of remnant MgO. It can be assumed that Mg(OH)2 \n\nreacts with SiO2 to form more gel (JIN; AL-TABBAA, 2014; LIAO; SENNA, 1993; LOTHENBACH et al., \n\n2015; ROOSZ et al., 2015; SANDBERG; MOSBERG, 1989; SZCZERBA et al., 2013; TEMUUJIN; OKADA; \n\n\n\n73 \n \n\n \n\nMACKENZIE, 1998, 2005; WALLING et al., 2015; ZHANG; VANDEPERRE; CHEESEMAN, 2014). This \n\nphenomenon may be accelerated by pretreatment of the MgO-SiO2 powder, either mechanical \n\n(grinding) or chemical (use of deflocculants such as sodium phosphates), that contribute to the \n\nreduction of the crystallization degree of Mg(OH)2 and therefore improve dissolution in aqueous \n\nenvironments. \n\nFigure 13- Enlarged view of the XRD spectra of the regions where gel bumps are present \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n  \n\n4.1.2 TG characterization \n\nFigure 14 shows thermogravimetric curves for hydrated MgO and synthetic M-S-H gel at 28 \n\ndays and their differential curves. From the differential thermogravimetric (DTG) curves it is possible \n\nto distinguish clearly two endothermic peaks, one below 300oC corresponding to the synthesized gel \n\nand, another one corresponding to Mg(OH)2, between 300 and 550oC. These two peaks have been \n\nfound by other authors that produced M-S-H gels (JIN; AL-TABBAA, 2014; LOTHENBACH et al., 2015; \n\nROOSZ et al., 2015; WALLING et al., 2015; ZHANG; VANDEPERRE; CHEESEMAN, 2014). These two \n\npeaks match perfectly the peaks produced by TG analysis of calcium silicate hydrate and calcium \n\nhydroxide, the main products obtained during the hydration of tri-calcium silicate (C3S) and bi-\n\n\n\n74 \n \n\n \n\ncalcium silicate (C2S), which together make up 75\u201380% of Portland cement (RAMACHANDRAN, \n\n2003). Also from Figure 14 it is depicted another tiny endothermic peak at around 750oC, in the DTG \n\ncurve of M-S-H gel but it has been neglected for phase determination. \n\nIn Figure 15, it is displayed TG and DTG analysis for every assessed formulation containing \n\nMgO - SiO2 at 7 and 28 days. In this figure it is also possible to identify the two main peaks obtained \n\nin Figure 14, concluding that the major hydrated phases present in this type of material are Mg(OH)2 \n\nand M-S-H gel. These results are very similar to those obtained after the hydration of synthetic C3S \n\nand C2S, where similar peaks where obtained at the same range of temperatures for Ca(OH)2 and C-\n\nS-H gel (GO\u00d1I et al., 2010). The only difference is that in the case of M-S-H gel the first endothermic \n\npeak is centered between 110 and 135oC, instead of 75oC for both C-S-H gels (GO\u00d1I et al., 2010). In \n\nthis way, at initial stages, it is likely to associate the mass loss to weakly adsorbed surface water and \n\nwater bound to exchangeable cations in the gel when the mass loss is produced below 300 and over \n\n550oC. This is also in agreement with other authors (SZCZERBA et al., 2013; WALLING et al., 2015; \n\nZHANG; VANDEPERRE; CHEESEMAN, 2014). From Zhang et al. TG analysis, where until 14 days the \n\nprincipal mass loss is produced below 300oC, the increase in water content means a higher M-S-H \n\ngel content since the higher amount of water the higher XRD intensity of the bumps. \n\nFigure 14- TG and DTG graphs of the hydrated MgO (AR200) and M-S-H gel with a 0.5 Mg/Si ratio \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\n\n\n75 \n \n\n \n\nThe same way it is reasonable to estimate the amount of Mg(OH)2 present in the samples \n\nby considering the mass loss between 300 and 550oC mainly due to the dehydroxilation of Mg(OH)2 \n\n(TEMUUJIN; OKADA; MACKENZIE, 1998), as follows: \n\nMg(OH)2 ? MgO+H2O 13 \n\n \n\nAfter such considerations, results of mass loss displayed in Table 13 are obtained from \n\nFigure 15. In accordance with XRD results (Figure 12), from these results it is also inferred that the \n\nhigher content in MgO, the higher content in Mg(OH)2 for both 7 and 28 days. This amount of \n\nMg(OH)2 for every formulation does not increase from 7 to 28 days. Contrarily to Mg(OH)2 results, \n\nthe content on M-S-H increases with the lower content of MgO at 7 days. However, at 28 days, the \n\nhigher content on magnsium silicate hydrated is achieved by the 60% MgO \u2013 40% SiO2 system. \n\nFigure 15- TG (left) and DTG (rigth) graphs of the of the different MgO-SIO2 samples at 7 days and at 28 days \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n76 \n \n\n \n\nTable 13- Weight loss according to TG results of the different MgO-SiO2 samples at different temperatures ranges \n\nFormulation Curing time Mass loss (%) \n\n      25-300oC 300-550oC 550-1000oC \n\n50%MgO-50%SiO2 7 days 11.07 10.02 3.00 \n\n28 days 11.71 9.81 3.24 \n\n60%MgO-40%SiO2 7 days 9.35 12.92 2.79 \n\n28 days 12.29 12.50 2.86 \n\n70%MgO-30%SiO2 7 days 6.87 15.72 2.38 \n\n28 days 10.02 15.48 2.78 \n\n80%MgO-20%SiO2 7 days 5.26 18.34 2.41 \n\n28 days 5.71 17.82 2.90 \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\n4.1.3 FT-IR characterization \n\nFT-IR results in Figure 16 show that the systems containing MgO and SiO2 present a similar \n\nspectra to systems with 100% MgO for every formulation, proving the great influence of Mg(OH)2 \n\nstructure in the hydrated pastes.  Brucite is the main hydration product expected for a powder with \n\n97.4% MgO purity, In addition. It is a member of the group of minerals known as the layer \n\nhydroxides, whose structures show similarities to the layer and chain silicates as well as the basic \n\nbuilding unit of all the layered double hydroxide (LDH) structure minerals (KAMATH; ANNAL \n\nTHERESE; GOPALAKRISHNAN, 1997).  Thus, it is uncertain to establish which vibrational bands \n\nbelong to Mg(OH)2 and which ones to M-S-H gel. 100% MgO hydrated samples, at both 7 and 28 \n\ndays, show bands around between 3000-3700, 1600, 1400 and 1040 cm-1 that are accurately \n\nreproduced for every MgO-SiO2 samples. For 100% MgO samples the broadening peak from 3300 \n\nto 3600 cm-1 and the peak at 1600 cm-1 are derivable from H-bonding of coordinated water (ALI; \n\nKOTP; EL-NAGGAR, 2010; LOTHENBACH et al., 2015) due to an excess of adsorbed water molecules \n\non the MgO surface, as the 0.5 w/c exceeds the water requirement for MgO hydration. The sharp \n\nabsorbance near 3696 cm-1 is a characteristic Mg\u2013OH stretch and around 1400 and 1040 cm-1 Mg-\n\nOH bend is also depicted (HANNA, 1965; BRATERMAN, 2006; TEMUUJIN; OKADA; MACKENZIE, \n\n1998). In the literature the peak at 1040 cm-1 also reveals Si\u2013O\u2013Si vibrations of the tetrahedral \n\nsheets within the talc structure (JIN; AL-TABBAA, 2014; WALLING et al., 2015). The sharp peak in \n\n3696 cm-1 is more prominent for samples with a higher content in MgO which is coincident with \n\nprevious results. In previous works with M-S-H gels, at 1640 cm-1 (ALI; KOTP; EL-NAGGAR, 2010) and \n\n1400 cm-1 (BREW; GLASSER, 2005), identical bonds are present (OH stretching) and at approximately \n\n\n\n77 \n \n\n \n\n1040 cm-1 a strong band is present due to Si\u2013O\u2013Si symmetrical stretching vibrations (JIN; AL-\n\nTABBAA, 2014; RASHID et al., 2009; WALLING et al., 2015), hindering the identification of the phases.  \n\nFigure 16- FT-IR spectra of the different MgO-SIO2 and 100% MgO samples at 7 days (left) and at 28 days (right) \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\nAlthough all the similarities in the spectrograph from 1000-4000 cm-1, clear differences arise \n\nfrom 400 to 1000 cm-1 between the 100% MgO and the MgO-SiO2 systems. For the MgO-SiO2 \n\nsystems, a sharp peak around 672cm-1 arises from to Si\u2013O bending vibrations (LOTHENBACH et al., \n\n2015) while Mg\u2013O vibrations occur at 455 cm-1 (BREW; GLASSER, 2005; ALI; KOTP; EL-NAGGAR, \n\n2010). However these bonds show no modifications for MgO-SiO2 samples over time and remain \n\nalike at 7 and 28 days, being complicated to establish whether phases concentration stay at equal \n\nlevels or gels with LDH are formed from Mg(OH)2. \n\n \n\n4.1.4 Hydration reactions and systems composition \n\nOn the basis of all the analysis carried out to understand the hydration of this cementitious \n\nsystem, the different hydration reactions are adjusted in Table 14 at ages 7 days and 28 days \n\nrespectively: \n\n\n\n78 \n \n\n \n\nTable 14- Hydration reaction of the different formulations studied at 7 and 28 days \n\n7 days \n  M-S-H gel  MH  Mu  Su  Hu \n\n50% MgO - 50% SiO2  0,40 M0.48 SH1.94 \n 0,56  0,06  0,12  0,51 \n\n60% MgO - 40% SiO2  0,29 M0.64 SH2.29  0,72  0,06  0,13  0,46 \n\n70% MgO - 30% SiO2  0,19 M0.97 SH2.76  0,87  0,07  0,13  0,47 \n\n80% MgO - 20% SiO2  0,10 M1.18 SH4.43  1,05  0,12  0,11  0,37 \n\n28 days \n  M-S-H gel  MH  Mu  Su  Hu \n\n50% MgO - 50% SiO2  0,42 M0.59 SH1.99 \n  0,55  0,01  0,11  0,46 \n\n60% MgO - 40% SiO2  0,30 M0.81 SH2.76   0,69  0,02  0,12  0,32 \n\n70% MgO - 30% SiO2  0,20  M1.12 SH3.61   0,86  0,05  0,12  0,28 \n\n80% MgO - 20% SiO2  0,11 M1.82 SH4.40   0,99  0,10  0,10  0,34 \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\nM, S and H represent the concentration of raw materials mixed, correcting the molarity \n\naccording to powders purity, to yield the different hydration products (MgO, SiO2 and H2O \n\nrespectively), MH stands for brucite which is determined as described in Section 3.2, Mu, Su and Hu \n\nrefer to the amount of unreacted raw materials. Unreacted silica and water have been calculated as \n\nthe difference between the original concentrations of raw materials and the concentration of these \n\nmolecules in the M-S-H and MH molecules. Mu concentration has been obtained from Rietveld \n\nanalysis, where periclase peaks have been compared between 100% AR200 MgO samples and the \n\ndifferent MgO-SiO2 systems. H in M-S-H has been quantified from TG analysis, considering water \n\nmolecules released below 300 and over 550 oC. M in M-S-H has been estimated as the difference \n\nbetween the original concentration before mixing and the MgO present in MH and Mu. With the \n\nhelp of EDS analysis (Table 15), MgO/SiO2 is determined in the M-S-H particles so it is also possible \n\nto determine S in M-S-H. It is important to remark that Hu represents a surplus of water required \n\nfor mixing and good workability. This excess of water is evaporated in the drying process, generating \n\nvoids in the matrix (capillary porosity).

Yellow particles are Mg(OH)2, blue regions are M-S-H gels and white particles are \n\nunreacted SiO2 \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\nAccording to hydration of MgO reaction mechanism (FEITKNECHT; BRAUN, 1967; \n\nFRUHWIRTH et al., 1985), water is chemisorbed on MgO to form a liquid layer on the surface. Then \n\nwater reacts with the MgO to form a surface layer of Mg(OH)2 and Mg(OH)2 subsequently dissolves \n\nin the water layer and, only after layer becomes saturated, precipitation takes places. In the \n\nmeantime plenty of OH- cations are released promoting the dissolution of SiO2 into silicic acid form \n\n[Si(OH)4] and anion ?Si-O- ion (ALEXANDER; HESTON; ILER, 1954) which increase the concentration \n\nof Si surrounding Mg(OH)2 crystals that can be seen in Images 1 and 2. The presence of Mg2+ cations \n\nneutralizes these anions charges. The apparition of the \u2013Si\u2013O\u2013Mg2+ linkage does not allow the \n\nreverse reaction to form siloxane bonds. Since this work is focused only on the early hydration \n\nstages, it is difficult to predict the evolution of the reaction over time. However, in the light of \n\nprevious works where ageing until 90 and 180 days is studied (SZCZERBA et al., 2013; JIN; AL-\n\nTABBAA, 2014), Mg(OH)2 is expected to continue to react with the unreacted silica to form more M-\n\nS-H gel. For longer curing time, TG curves tend to be smoother indicating the continuous transition \n\n\n\n81 \n \n\n \n\nfrom brucite to M\u2013S\u2013H in the region between 300 and 550oC. Also from TG curves, in which \n\nsynthesized gels have been used (LOTHENBACH et al., 2015; ROOSZ et al., 2015), it can be deduced \n\nthat at this range of temperatures (300-550oC) gel dehydroxylation takes place, suggesting that OH- \n\nions from Mg(OH)2 end up as a part of the poor crystallized structure of the magnesium silicate \n\nhydrate by replacing part of the silicate chains. \n\n4.1.6 Matrix selection for fibre-cement purposes: pH evaluation and compressive strength analysis \n\nFrom Figure 19 it can be seen that all the samples containing MgO present notoriously lower \n\npH values compared to PC samples, confirming a lower concentration of OH- ions in the matrix. \n\nMeanwhile Control sample keeps stable pH values with time (12.80-13.00), MgO samples present a \n\ndescent value of pH for all the formulations. In so far as MgO is increased in the MgO-SiO2 \n\nformulations, the pH values do not decrease as much as it happens for samples with lower contents \n\nin MgO since their higher content in hydroxyls. It can be observed that the most important reduction \n\nof pH occurs between 1 and 7 days. From that age, only 50% MgO \u2013 50% SiO2 samples present a pH \n\ndecrease until the age of 21 days, when it gets stabilized. pH results are consistent with previous \n\nworks where MgO-SiO2 systems are analyzed (ZHANG; CHEESEMAN; VANDEPERRE, 2011), obtaining \n\npH values below 10 at 28 days. In addition, samples containing 60% of MgO and 40% of SiO2 have a \n\npH value around 10 at 7 days and decreases with time to reach a pH value of 9.8. This reduced \n\nalkalinity could be very advantageous since pH values below 11 at early stages help to prevent \n\ncellulosic fibre degradation (M\u00c1RMOL et al., 2013). \n\nFigure 19- pH evolution over time of different MgO-SiO2 blended systems and control samples (100% Portland cement) \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n\n\n82 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 20 shows the compressive strength results. At 7 days, it appears to be a slight \n\nenhancement of the mechanical strength with the increase of the MgO in the samples. This \n\ndifference is statically significant (Table 16) when the MgO content varies from 60 to 70%, so it can \n\nbe concluded that at 7 days of curing samples containing 50 and 60% of MgO and 70 and 80% have \n\nsimilar values. At this same age, PC samples have significant higher values compared to almost every \n\nsamples with MgO. The only sample with an equivalent performance is 80% MgO \u2013 20% SiO2. \n\nFigure 20- Compressive axial strength of different MgO-SiO2 pastes and control samples (100% Portland cement) at 7 \nand 28 days \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\nHowever at 28 days, all the formulations containing MgO have at least the same \n\nperformance that Control samples have. It is also remarkable that all the MgO-SiO2 samples present \n\na strength improvement for every formulation, in contrast to Control samples which have no \n\nstatistic considerable variation. 60% MgO \u2013 40% SiO2 and 70% MgO \u2013 30% SiO2 systems have the \n\nhighest values, 71.8 and 71.4 MPa respectively, showing a statistical difference with the rest of the \n\nsamples. These values are also around 30% higher compared to PC samples, with an average \n\ncompressive strength of 54.5 MPa. This fact may be explained because of the excessive water to \n\ncement ratio used (0.5) to mold Portland cement pastes. The majority authors appear to have fixed \n\nwith the remark that complete hydration is not possible if w/c is below 0.38 although it has been \n\nreported total hydration even in pastes with w/c = 0.22 (TAYLOR, 1997). However a w/c = 0.5 is not \n\ndisproportionate for MgO-SiO2 systems, according to Lothenbach et al. (2015), who establishes that \n\nM-S-H gels present a silicate sheet structure and a higher amount of chemically bound water \n\ncompared to Portland cement. \n\n\n\n83 \n \n\n \n\nTable 16- Compressive strength results of the different MgO-SiO2 systems and control samples (100% Portland cement). \n\nTukey test (0.05 confidence) are represented next to the numeric value.

The less free water in the \n\nmatrix leads to higher compressive strength. This is in line with what happens with other types of \n\ninorganic cement as Portland cement (TAYLOR, 1997; LEA; HEWLETT, 2004), where an increase of \n\nporosity leads to a drastic decrease of mechanical properties. Another clear trend related to \n\ncompressive strength is the relation between compressive strength and total amount of hydrated \n\nphases. This relation is especially evident at 28 days Figure 21b, where compressive strength and \n\ntotal amount of hydrated phases match in an accurate manner. Also it is possible to infer that all \n\nthe samples with MgO have a compressive strength at 28 days to compressive strength at 7 days \n\nratio (Rc28d/Rc7d in Table 16) higher than Control samples. This ratio has a precise coincidence with \n\nthe amount of hydrated phases in the pastes. This fact is an interesting evidence to conclude that \n\nthe amount of M-S-H is not the only determinant factor to obtain more resistant cements at initial \n\nstages. \n\n\n\n84 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 21- (a) Trends in double Y-axis of the compressive axial strength (left axis) and free water content (right axis). (b) \nTrends in double Y-axis of the compressive axial strength (left axis) and total hydrated phases content (right axis) \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\nAttending to the relationship between compressive strength and the Mg/Si ratio for the \n\ndifferent formulations (Figure 22), at 7 days it is possible to detect how the higher Mg/Si ratio implies \n\na higher compressive strength. However this trend is not displayed at 28 days, where the \n\nformulation with highest Mg/Si ratio (80% MgO \u2013 80% SiO2) presents the lowest mechanical \n\nperformance. All which can be deduced from Figure 22 is that the formulations with the uppermost \n\nstrength for both ages, 7 and 28 days, present a Mg/Si ratio ranging from 0.8-1.2, according to what \n\nis pointed out at the literature (JIN; AL-TABBAA, 2014; LI et al., 2014; LOTHENBACH et al., 2015; \n\nWALLING et al., 2015).  This difference in Mg/Si content may be associated to a change in M-S-H gel \n\nstructure (BREW; GLASSER, 2005; LOTHENBACH et al., 2015; WALLING et al., 2015), achieving a more \n\nresistant structure (Q3 silica tetrahedral) for Mg/Si ratios around 0.8-1.2. \n\n\n\n85 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 22- Trends in double Y-axis of the compressive axial strength (left axis) and Mg/Si ratio (right axis) \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\nIn view of the pH and compressive strength results, in order to choosing the optimal matrix \n\nto produce fibre-cement products reinforced with lignocellulosic fibres, the system that would offer \n\nthe lowest pH value is the 50% MgO \u2013 50% SiO2 formulation. However this formulation has \n\napproximately 30% less of compressive strength compared with the 60% MgO \u2013 40% SiO2 \n\nformulation and besides the difference in pH between this two formulations is not very noteworthy. \n\nSince the formulation that offers a better compromise between alkalinity and mechanical \n\nproperties, the most promising formulation selected is the 60-40. \n\n \n\n4.2 BLOCK 2 \n\n4.2.1 Flexural test  \n\n4.2.1.1  Composites reinforced with pine fibres \n\nAt 28 days the best MOR results, shown in  \n\nTable 7, are achieved by PC samples (average of 11.35 MPa). These values are significantly \n\nhigher compared to the samples made out of MgO-SiO2 cement (9.03 MPa). This difference may be \n\nattributed to the matrix performance and therefore explained because of the water to binder ratio \n\nfor the different formulations. As it can be seen in Table 8, the water demand for the samples where \n\nMgO-SiO2 cement has been used (0.60) is higher than for samples using Portland cement (0.45). This \n\n\n\n86 \n \n\n \n\nwater/binder factor can generate an excess of water in the matrix, increasing the capillary pores, \n\nwhich is closely related to the decrease of the mechanical performance of cementitious materials ( \n\nCHEN; WU, 2013; KUMAR; BHATTACHARJEE, 2003; OZTURK; BARADAN, 2008). A data that confirms \n\nthis fact is the bulk density of the materials at this age (Table 19), where the values for MgO-SiO2 \n\ncement samples (1.39 g/cm3) are inferior to those for PC samples (1.54 g/cm3). At this same age, it \n\ncan be seen that MOE is also clearly superior for Portland cement samples when compared to \n\nsamples with MgO-SiO2 cement, presenting values of 7.59 and 3.26 GPa respectively. This fact also \n\nsupports the idea that the higher flexural strength for samples with PC is correlated with its higher \n\nbinder performance at 28 days, since MOE in cementitious materials is closely related to \n\ncementitious materials strength, considering the low modulus of vegetable fibres (ARDANUY; \n\nCLARAMUNT; TOLEDO FILHO, 2015; MEHTA; MONTEIRO, 2006; NOGUCHI et al., 2009). \n\nTable 17- MOR, LOP and MOE results of every formulation at 28 days and after 200 cycles of accelerated ageing \n\n    MOR* (MPa) LOP* (MPa) MOE* (GPa) \n\n    28 days 200 acc 28 days 200 acc 28 days 200 acc \n\nMgO-SiO2 - Pine \nx? 9.03 a, A 10.63 a, B 2.94 a, A 5.94 a, B 3.26 a, A 4.92 a, B \n\n?? 0.70   1.68   0.68   0.89   0.19   0.35   \n\nMgO-SiO2 - Eucalyptus \nx? 9.23 a, A 10.36 a, B 4.49 b, A 4.98 b, A 5.71 b, A 5.99 a, A \n\n?? 1.12   1.38   0.39   1.23   0.38   0.70   \n\nPC - Pine \nx? 11.35 b, A 9.07 b, B 6.55 b, A 7.45 c, A 7.59 c, A 9.13 b, B \n\n?? 0.93   0.78   1.30   0.84   0.91   0.35   \n\nPC - Eucalyptus \nx? 11.24 b, A 7.69 c, B 5.22 c, A 6.95 a, c, B 8.84 c, A 11.16 c, B \n\n?? 1.06   1.20   1.33   0.91   2.15   1.53   \n\n*MOR= Modulus of Rupture, LOP= Limit of Proportionality, MOE= Modulus of Elasticity       \n\nSame lower case letters in the same column mean no statistical significant difference and vice versa.   \n\nSame capital letters in the same row mean no significant statistical significant difference and vice versa.   \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\nHowever the excess of water within the matrix, and hence a more porous matrix, can be \n\nresponsible for a better interface between fibre and matrix, where pull-out is favourished instead \n\nof fibres collapse, promoting a higher deformation and absorbing more energy (SAVASTANO; \n\nWARDEN; COUTTS, 2005; TOLEDO FILHO et al., 2000). Even with a lower MOR for MgO-SiO2 samples, \n\nSE thereof at 28 days (2.75 kJ/m2) is significantly outstanding when compared to PC samples (1.51 \n\nkJ/m2), which means that this new type of cement presents a good compatibility with pine pulp to \n\n\n\n87 \n \n\n \n\nresist flexural loads. The good flexural performance of the samples using MgO-SiO2 cement is still \n\nmore pronounced with regard to the specific deflection at 50% of MOR, where these present a value \n\nof 0.05, more than twice than the value obtained for PC samples.  \n\nFigure 23- Tension-deflection curves of the composites reinforced with pine (a) and eucalyptus (b) pulps for both types \nof binders, MgO-SiO2 (MS) and Portland (OPC), at 28 days and after 200 cycles of accelerated ageing \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\nIn contrast to what occurs at 28 days, the highest MOR values after 200 aac is exhibited by \n\nMgO-SiO2 samples (10.63 MPa). These samples experienced a statistical gain (from 9.03 MPa) that \n\nis accompanied also by another statistical MOE increase (from 3.26 to 4.92 MPa). All together \n\nindicates that the MOR improvement for MgO-SiO2 samples corresponds to the matrix modification \n\nand densification of the interfacial transition zone (ITZ). This is also based on the notable increase \n\nof the bulk density that is experienced (from 1.39 to 1.46 g\u00b7cm-1) by these samples (Table 19). The \n\nmatrix modification of MgO-SiO2 samples may be responsible for the reduction of the specific \n\ndeflection at 50% of MOR due to changes in the fibre-matrix interface. A less porous matrix may \n\ndensify the vicinity of the fibre region. Therefore the adherence between fibre and matrix is \n\nimproved and pull-out mechanism is hindered (SAVASTANO; WARDEN; COUTTS, 2005; TOLEDO \n\nFILHO et al., 2000). \n\nIn the case of samples made out of PC the MOR suffers a drastic loss although MOE rises \n\nwith a statistical significance, from 7.59 to 9.13 GPa. MOE and LOP are related to the matrix phase \n\ndensification, which is favoured along hydration process that takes place after ageing cycles. \n\n\n\n88 \n \n\n \n\nAccording to what was suggested previously, in this case the improvement of the matrix \n\nperformance does not imply a better mechanical resistance of the whole composite. It is remarkable \n\nthat, apart from suffering a drastic reduction of the MOR, specific energy and deflection, after \n\nageing the samples made with PC have a slight increase of LOP, when compared to samples at 28 \n\ndays. Considering LOP as the first cracking point in the stress-deformation curve (ARDANUY; \n\nCLARAMUNT; TOLEDO FILHO, 2015) and therefore the point where strain hardening begins, the \n\nlimited growth of flexural stress after LOP may be considered as a decline of the reinforcing capacity \n\nof the fibres. \n\nTable 18- SE and SD results of every formulation at 28 days and after 200 cycles of accelerated ageing \n\n    SE* (kJ/m2) SD* (mm/mm) \n\n    28 days 200 acc 28 days 200 acc \n\nMgO-SiO2 - Pine \nx? 2.75 a, A 1.10 a, B 0.05 a, A 0.02 a, B \n\n?? 0.61   0.17   0.01   0.00   \n\nMgO-SiO2 - Eucalyptus \nx? 5.40 b, A 5.07 a, A 0.10 b, A 0.08 b, A \n\n?? 0.98   1.06   0.01   0.01   \n\nPC - Pine \nx? 1.51 a, A 0.18 b, B 0.02 b, A 0.01 c, A \n\n?? 0.49   0.05   0.01   0.00   \n\nPC - Eucalyptus \nx? 4.97 b, A 0.14 c, B 0.08 c, A 0.00 a, c, B \n\n?? 1.67   0.05   0.02   0.00   \n\n*SE= Specific Energy, SD= Specific deflection   \n\nSame lower case letters in the same column mean no statistical significant difference and vice versa. \n\nSame capital letters in the same row mean no significant statistical significant difference and vice versa. \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\n4.2.1.2 Composites reinforced with eucalyptus fibres \n\nFor samples reinforced with eucalyptus pulps, identical trends to those observed for \n\nsamples reinforced with pine pulp are found at both 28 days and after ageing treatment. Samples \n\nmade out of PC present the highest MOR values at 28 days (11.24 MPa) but these values severely \n\ndecrease after ageing (7.69 MPa) since bleached fibres are more susceptible to degradation. \n\nSamples with MgO-SiO2 cement, as happened for samples reinforced with pine pulp, initially present \n\nlower MOR values with higher SE at 28 days (9.23 MPa and 5.40 kJ/m2 respectively), although no \n\nstatistical reduction of the SE occurs after ageing. This behaviour is exceptional since this \n\nconservation of the toughness after ageing is produced for the toughest formulation (5.07 kJ/m2 \n\n\n\n89 \n \n\n \n\nafter ageing). This higher toughness observed for samples reinforced with eucalyptus may be linked \n\nto their morphological properties (TONOLI et al., 2010). As it can be seen in  \n\nFigure 10, average length and width of eucalyptus fibres is considerably inferior to pine. \n\nThus, for the same mass of reinforcing material, more reinforcing elements are dispersed within the \n\nmatrix. This generates more reinforcing points to prevent cracking incidence (TONOLI et al., 2010). \n\nAlso, from Figure 30, it is displayed a better dispersion of the eucalyptus fibres, avoiding the \n\npresence of unreinforced regions and, therefore, the propagation of major cracking before MOR is \n\nachieved.  \n\nTable 19- BD, WA and AP results of every formulation at 28 days and after 200 cycles of accelerated ageing \n\n    BD* (g/cm3) WA* (%) AP* (%) \n\n    28 days 200 acc 28 days 200 acc 28 days 200 acc \n\nMgO-SiO2 - Pine \nx? 1,39 a, A 1,46 a, B 30,13 a, A 27,49 a, B 42,55 a, A 38,92 a, B \n\n?? 0,03   0,03   0,58   0,56   0,49   0,86   \n\nMgO-SiO2 - Eucalyptus \nx? 1,52 b, A 1,52 b, A 24,97 b, A 22,51 b, B 38,11 b, A 34,68 b, B \n\n?? 0,02   0,02   0,65   0,71   0,65   0,65   \n\nPC - Pine \nx? 1,54 b, A 1,57 c, A 25,19 b, A 20,28 c, B 38,94 b, c, A 32,54 c, B \n\n?? 0,03   0,01   0,94   0,61   1,05   0,73   \n\nPC - Eucalyptus \nx? 1,52 b, A 1,56 d, B 26,82 c, A 18,06 d, B 39,51 c, A 29,71 d, B \n\n?? 0,02   0,03   1,20   0,80   0,65   0,81   \n\n*BD= Bulk Density, WA= Water Absorption, AP= Apparent Porosity. \n\nSame lower case letters in the same column mean no statistical significant difference and vice versa. \n\nSame capital letters in the same row mean no significant statistical significant difference and vice versa. \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\nAnother disclosed aspect from flexural tests is the fibre preservation achieved by using low \n\nalkaline cement. It is reported that bleached pulps are more prone to chemical degradation due to \n\ntheir lower lignin content (MOHR; NANKO; KURTIS, 2005). Lignin acts as a barrier: being the first \n\npulp component to suffer alkaline attack and consequently saving cellulose and hemicellulose \n\ninitially from this deterioration. Such observation is noticeable by a drastic reduction of the SE (from \n\n4.97 to 0.14 kJ/m-2) for the samples of PC. Considering that the formulation where MgO-SiO2 cement \n\nand eucalyptus pulp are used present the higher SE and SD results, at 28 days and after ageing, it \n\ncan be concluded that this type of material does not suffer a chemical degradation. In spite of the \n\n\n\n90 \n \n\n \n\nreduction of the SE, this is not statistically meaningful, and the reduction of specific deflection may \n\nbe linked to the modification of the fibre-matrix interface due to a matrix densification.   \n\n \n\n4.2.2 Apparent porosity vs MOE \n\nFrom Figure 24 it is possible to appreciate a clear trend relating the decrease of apparent \n\nporosity with the increase of MOE. For every formulation, it is noted that samples experiment a \n\ndecrease of the apparent porosity after ageing, accompanied by an enhancement of MOE. As \n\npreviously mentioned this can be related to an improvement of the binder performance, since \n\ncement hydration continues after 28 days (ARDANUY; CLARAMUNT; TOLEDO FILHO, 2015; \n\nNOGUCHI et al., 2009). Thus, the matrix becomes less porous which improves the mechanical \n\nperformance (MOE in this case) (CHEN; WU, 2013). The same situation can be proposed for the \n\nsamples made out of MgO-SiO2  cement (ZHANG; VANDEPERRE; CHEESEMAN, 2014), as the \n\nhydration happens gradually, since the reaction of the SiO2 particles with Mg2+ ions takes place over \n\ntime, because the hydration of MgO is needed to release ions and this process is not immediate \n\n(THOMAS; MUSSO; PRESTINI, 2014). The increase in matrix rigidity may modify the fibre-matrix \n\ninterface, and this phenomenon can be attributed to the apparent porosity reduction. According to \n\nthe graph, PC samples experience greater porosity reduction than MgO-SiO2 samples after ageing. \n\nThis may be due to the larger amount of water retained within the MgO-SiO2  matrix after moulding \n\n(Table 8), which once the samples are set becomes void volume (CHEN; WU, 2013). This excess of \n\nwater, added to the water absorbed by the vegetable fibres, generates an excess of voids that \n\nresults into a less resistant material. The only case where water demand does neither imply a \n\nstatistical difference in AP nor MOE is for PC samples at 28 days. However, the same trend observed \n\nfor the rest of the samples is also noticed for PC after ageing.  \n\n\n\n91 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 24- Average values of modulus of elasticity (MOE) vs. apparent porosity (AP) of samples at 28 days and after 200 \naccelerated ageing cycles for both types of cement: MgO-SiO2 (MS) and Portland cement (OPC). Horizontal and vertical \n\nlines indicate the standard deviation of every sample \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\n4.2.3 SEM analysis \n\nFrom SEM analysis it is possible to see that in samples with Portland cement, vegetable \n\nfibres undergo mineralization after 200 aac. Figure 25 shows many eucalyptus fibres with the lumen \n\nfilled with hydration products (encircled in white) after ageing. Also in Figure 25, there is a region \n\n(black square) that is zoomed for a better observation of this event. By EDS characterization it is \n\ninferred that there is a high concentration in Ca(OH)2 in the lumens of the eucalyptus fibres, since it \n\nis detected a high presence of Ca (green dots in Figure 26) and insignificant concentration of Si (blue \n\ndots). This situation may be explained by the bleached nature of the eucalyptus used in this study. \n\nWhile lignin is blocking the entrance of the ions in the lumen and pores of the pine fibre (Figure 26), \n\nthe absence of lignin in the chemical composition of eucalyptus pulp may produce an increase of \n\nthe fibres permeability, which also increases the ingress of Ca2+ and OH- ions that settle with time \n\nto produce Ca(OH)2 crystals, as proposed by Tonoli et al. (2012). Contrarily to what happens with \n\nsamples with Portland cement and reinforced with eucalyptus fibres, when samples are reinforced \n\n\n\n92 \n \n\n \n\nwith pine pulp, the lumen of the fibres suffer much less mineralization, since unbleached pulp \n\ncontain a higher percentage of lignin (Table 6) that helps with blocking the entrance of hydration \n\nproducts inside the lumen (Figure 27). For this type of reinforcement no trace of Ca(OH)2 penetrates \n\ninto the inner regions of the fibres and rather stays surrounding the outer region of the fibres  \n\nIn the zoomed region (Figure 27), high portlandite concentration regions are found in the \n\nsurroundings of the fibres. This may be justified, in contrast to what happens for bleached pulps, by \n\npine pulps nature. The pine fibres used in these samples are unbleached and thereby the presence \n\nof lignin could act as a hydrophobic barrier for water not to accede to the interior of the fibres \n\n(TONOLI et al., 2012). However an adsorption phenomenon takes place and together with the water \n\nrelease of the fibres with time generates regions with high content in water in the vicinity of the \n\nreinforcing elements. This provokes the dissolution and precipitation of the Ca(OH)2 on the surface \n\nof the fibres, which may explain the decay of the mechanical performance after accelerated ageing \n\n(MELO FILHO; SILVA; TOLEDO FILHO, 2013; TOLEDO FILHO et al., 2009; WEI; MEYER, 2014). However \n\nit is possible to notice that the mineralization of the fibre, as in the case of eucalyptus fibre, is more \n\ndestructive (based on loss of both MOR and SE) than the degradation provoked by portlandite in \n\nthe external surface of the fibre (as in the case of Pine).  \n\n  \n\n\n\n93 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 25- SEM images of polished surfaces of a composite made out of Portland cement and reinforced with eucalyptus \nmicrofibres after 200 cycles of accelerated ageing.

In Figure 27, the surrounding area of a reinforcement fibre is displayed and it is possible \n\nto distinguish clearly the presence of Mg(OH)2 crystals at 28 days of age (encircled in white). \n\nCompared to samples after 200 aac, a remarkable difference is observable. It is possible to detect \n\nthat the amount of Mg(OH)2 crystals after 200 acc is reduced. This may be a consequence of the \n\nevolution of the hydration reaction with time, where Mg(OH)2 particles react with anhydrous SiO2 \n\nto form additional M-S-H gel. An effect of the continuity of the reaction over time is the densification \n\nof the matrix after ageing which would explain the reduction of the SE after ageing (Table 18) \n\nalthough no morphological evidence of degradation of the fibres can be observed. At 28 days, Figure \n\n28 shows noticeably regions where matrix and fibre are debonded (black arrows). After 200 cycles \n\nof accelerated ageing (JIN; AL-TABBAA, 2014; SZCZERBA et al., 2013), fibre-matrix interface is \n\nmodified and the gap between the cement matrix and the reinforcement is considerably reduced. \n\nAnother outcome from matrix densification is the reduction of the water absorption and porosity \n\nof the samples for both types of reinforcement (Table 19).  \n\n  \n\n\n\n95 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 28- SEM images of polished surfaces of composites made out of MgO-SiO2 cement and reinforced with pine \n\nmicrofibres at 28 days (a) and after 200 accelerated ageing cycles (b) and eucalyptus microfibres at 28 days (c) and after \n\n200 accelerated ageing cycles (d).

Black arrows point to debonded regions \n\nof fibre-matrix interface \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\nAlso in Figure 29 it is possible to see how matrix densening affects the fracture mechanism. \n\nFrom Figure 29a, where a surface of fracture is depicted from a MgO-SiO2 composite sample \n\nreinforced with pine pulp at 28 days, it is present an obvious space between hydration products and \n\nreinforcement element. However after accelerated ageing, Figure 29b, hydration products are \n\ntotally attached to the surface of the fibre. \n\n  \n\n\n\n96 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 29- Surface of fracture of composites made out of MgO-SiO2 cement and reinforced with pine microfibres at 28 \ndays (a) and after 200 accelerated ageing cycles (b) and eucalyptus microfibres at 28 days (c) and after 200 accelerated \n\nageing cycles (d). Black arrows point to the fibre-matrix interface \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\nThis phenomenon is not important for samples reinforced with eucalyptus fibre (Figure 29c \n\nand Figure 29d). The reduction in the space between fibre and matrix is not as relevant as it is for \n\nsamples reinforced with pine pulp, probably due to the lower water/cement associated to the lower \n\nwater retention of the eucalyptus fibres. At 28 days, Figure 29c, the surface of fracture does not \n\npresent a clear debonding of the fibre, generating energy dissipation by pull-out, showing no matrix \n\ndamage. This behavior is also present after ageing, Figure 29d, in preserving fibre-matrix interface. \n\nFrom SEM analysis, another aspect that can be explained is the different reinforcement \n\nbehavior related to the different types of pulp. According to Figure 10 it can be deduced that for the \n\nsame mass of reinforcement, a greater amount of eucalyptus reinforcement elements is present \n\nwhen compared to pine fibres since eucalyptus pulp has shorter and thinner microfibres. This is in \n\n\n\n97 \n \n\n \n\naccordance to Figure 30, where polished surfaces of samples reinforced with pine and eucalyptus. \n\nFrom these images it can be seen how the composite reinforced with eucalyptus pulp Figure 30b \n\npresents greater number of reinforcing elements than the corresponding ones reinforced with pine \n\npulp, Figure 30a. This may explain the different SE presented for both types of reinforcement (Table \n\n18). Consequently, the higher number of reinforcing elements implies higher energy dissipation (at \n\nleast in the initial ages). \n\nFigure 30- SEM image of a polished surface of a composite made out of MgO-SiO2 cement and reinforced with pine (a) \nand eucalyptus (b) microfibres \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\n4.3 BLOCK 3 \n\n4.3.1 XRD analysis \n\nCarbonation curing effectiveness is confirmed by XRD tests. In Figure 31, it is shown for \n\nuncarbonated treatments, both non-aged (NC+NA) and aged (NC+A) that the main crystalline phase, \n\napart from calcite (limestone), is brucite whose peaks are clearly detected at around 18, 38 and 58o \n\n2?. However, those brucite peaks for carbonated samples, non-aged (C+NA) and aged (C+A), present \n\na lessened intensity while new crystalline phases corresponding to hydromagnesite are present [1\u2013\n\n6]. Although many of the characteristic peaks  corresponding to hydromagnesite XRD patterns are \n\noverlapped with either dolomite or calcite peaks (30.9, 35.8 and 43o 2?), there are other peaks in \n\nFigure 31 very characteristic from hydromagnesite only present in carbonated samples (at 13.7, 15, \n\n\n\n98 \n \n\n \n\n20 and 26.5o 2??. It is expected that under the carbonation curing conditions (20% of CO2, 45oC and \n\n90% RH) hydromagnesite is formed following this reaction:  \n\n5Mg(OH)2 +4CO2 ? Mg5(CO3)4(OH)24H2O (14) \n\nThe lowering of the brucite peaks is even more significant for carbonated samples after \n\naccelerated ageing (C+A). Since the drying stage of the accelerated cycles is carried out at 60oC, this \n\ntemperature promotes the formation of more hydromagnesite crystals over time once the process \n\nis started, even at atmospheric CO2 concentration.Another consequence is the partial carbonation \n\nof the M-S-H gels under higher CO2 concentration curing. According to several studies, in the \n\nintervals between 32-39o and 53-63o 2? a hump corresponding to M-S-H gels (LI et al., 2014; \n\nLOTHENBACH et al., 2015; SZCZERBA et al., 2013; WALLING et al., 2015) is expected. The presence \n\nof this hump is confirmed for non-carbonated samples (NC+NA and NC+A) (Figure 32). Nonetheless \n\nfor carbonated samples (C+NA and C+A) the expected hump is plainly reduced in these regions \n\nconfirming the reduction of the gel content.  \n\nFigure 31- XRD diffractograms of the different formulations studied: Uncarbonated-Unaged (NC+NA), Uncarbonated-\nAged (NC+A), Carbonated-Unaged (C+NA) and Carbonated-Aged (C+A).

Dotted curves in black represent the gel bumps \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n4.3.2 TG and DTG analysis \n\nFrom TG curves displayed in Figure 33, the effect of carbonation curing is proved by an \n\nincreased mass loss of the formulations with high CO2 concentration curing, both unaged and aged \n\n(C+NA and C+A) compared to the non-carbonated samples (NC+NA and NC+A). This augment in \n\nmass loss may be linked to the decomposition of the hydrated products formed during the curing at \n\nhigh CO2 concentration.  \n\nCarbonated samples show similar DTG curves (Figure 34) to uncarbonated samples, \n\npresenting 4 well defined peaks for both treatments at around 105-135, 410-422, 450-459 and 777-\n\n786oC. Those last two peaks, centred at around 455 and 780oC, correspond to polypropylene and \n\nlimestone filler decomposition respectively. Polypropylene thermal disintegration is a single process \n\nthat initiates at about 334oC and it ends at 493oC, achieving its maximum degree at 452oC, with a \n\nmass loss about 99.3 wt %, and an insignificant residual mass of 0.7 wt % (P?RP?RI?? et al., 2014). \n\nThe almost complete disintegration of polypropylene justifies the presence of a peak in spite of its \n\nlow weight in the formulation (2 wt %). Thermal decomposition of calcite single crystals, is produced \n\n\n\n100 \n \n\n \n\nin the following reaction, CaCO3(s) ? CaO(s) + CO2(g), starting at T ~ 600\u00b0C and completed at around \n\n850\u00b0C; after losing 44 wt% matching to the stoichiometric CO2 amount in CaCO3 (RODRIGUEZ-\n\nNAVARRO et al., 2009). Cellulose decomposition, main component of the unbleached pine pulp, is \n\nnot well defined since it is decomposed at a single stage about 363oC (SHEN et al., 2013)  which is \n\noverlapped with a major peak. Cellulose also has a mass loss of 56 wt % and a reduced presence in \n\nthe formulation (3 wt %) that makes difficult to quantify its disintegration from Figure 33. \n\nThe effect of accelerated carbonation curing is clearly observed by differential \n\nthermogravimetry analysis. Comparing carbonated and uncarbonated samples DTG curves (Figure \n\n34) two clear new peaks appear for the carbonated samples at around 260 and 520oC, corresponding \n\nto decomposition of hydromagnesite (BOTHA; STRYDOM, 2001; HAURIE et al., 2007; HOLLINGBERY; \n\nHULL, 2010a, 2010b, 2012; V\u00c1GV\u00d6LGYI et al., 2008), which is the main product obtained as a \n\nconsequence of the carbonation reactions. The temperature range in which hydromagnesite \n\ndecomposition takes place varies from 220 and 550oC and it can be divided in three different stages, \n\naccording to equations (15-17): (15) release of lattice water in the temperatures range of 220\u2013\n\n290oC, (16) dehydroxylation occurred in the range of 375\u2013470oC and (17) decarbonation from 470 \n\nto 550oC. Thus the observed peak at 260oC may be associated to the first stage while the peak \n\nobserved at 520oC corresponds to the third step.  \n\n4MgCO3 \u00b7Mg(OH)2 \u00b7 4H2O ?  4MgCO3 \u00b7Mg(OH)2 +4H2O (dehydration) (15) \n\n4MgCO3 \u00b7Mg(OH)2 ?  4MgCO3 +MgO+H2O (dehydroxylation) (16) \n\n4MgCO3 ?  4MgO+4CO2 (decarbonation) (17) \n\n \n\nApart from these new peaks, the displacement of the peaks at around 110 and 410oC for \n\nuncarbonated samples may be attributed to carbonation curing. The dislocation of the peak from \n\n410 to 425oC can be related to the transfer of part of the OH- groups from Mg(OH)2 to \n\nhydromagnesite, since main brucite dehydroxylation happens at around 400oC (WANG et al., 2014) \n\nwhile dehydroxylation for hydromagnesite occurs at around 430oC (BEALL et al., 2013; HAURIE et \n\nal., 2007). Regarding the peak centred at 110oC, attributable to the loss of loosely bound interlayer \n\nwater in M-S-H gels (LI et al., 2014; LOTHENBACH et al., 2015; SZCZERBA et al., 2013; WALLING et \n\nal., 2015), it is possible to conclude that it has been displaced up to higher temperatures due to a \n\npartial carbonation of the gel induced by the high CO2 concentration. This phenomenon has also \n\nbeen reported for Portland cement pastes (ROSTAMI et al., 2012), where C-S-H phase is disarranged \n\n\n\n101 \n \n\n \n\nby carbonates and C-S-H containing relatively high carbon content is detected by Energy Dispersive \n\nSpectroscopy (EDS). Though unusually present in nature, it is possible to find carbonate-altered \n\nserpentine rocks (listwanite), from a natural CO2 sequestration process through minerals \n\ncarbonation (HANSEN et al., 2005). This process of carbonation of the serpentine crystals has been \n\nbacked by experimental studies on a similar but simpler (MgO-SiO2-H2O-CO2) system (BJERGA; \n\nKONOP\u00c1SEK; PEDERSEN, 2015; KLEIN; GARRIDO, 2011; KLEIN; MCCOLLOM, 2013). A possible \n\nexplanation for this occurrence is the formation of a serpentine-carbonate crystal from M-S-H gel, \n\nanalogue to talc-carbonates described in (BJERGA; KONOP\u00c1SEK; PEDERSEN, 2015). \n\nOn the other hand, no evidences of MgCO3 are confirmed by the thermogravimetry in this \n\nstudy. During magnesite decomposition a large endothermic peak centred at around 630\u2013660oC \n\noccurs, yet it does not appear for none of the formulations studied (Figure 34). Only tiny traces of \n\nmagnesite are noticed in this study and they come from the decarbonation of dolomite present in \n\nlimestone filler.  \n\nComparing samples before and after accelerated ageing, no significant mass loss variations \n\nare identified by the thermogravimetry tests (Figure 33). Thus, hydration phases for both \n\ncarbonated and uncarbonated samples are stable. This is especially relevant for carbonated \n\nproducts, given that after 100 accelerated ageing cycles the mass loss remains the same as \n\nimmediately after curing. \n\nFigure 33- TG curves of the different formulations studied: Uncarbonated-Unaged (NC+NA), Uncarbonated-Aged (NC+A), \nCarbonated-Unaged (C+NA) and Carbonated-Aged (C+A) \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n\n\n102 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 34- DTG curves of the different formulations studied: Uncarbonated-Unaged (NC+NA), Uncarbonated-Aged \n(NC+A), Carbonated-Unaged (C+NA) and Carbonated-Aged (C+A) \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\n4.3.3 SEM \n\nBy means of SEM analysis, it is also possible to establish the effectiveness of the high CO2 \n\nconcentration curing. Figure 35 shows an image of a fractured surface of a non-carbonated sample \n\nafter ageing, where it is possible to find the typical hydrated phases of the system MgO-SiO2-H2O: \n\nMg(OH)2 and M-S-H gels (JIN; AL-TABBAA, 2014; LI et al., 2014; SZCZERBA et al., 2013; ZHANG; \n\nCHEESEMAN; VANDEPERRE, 2011; ZHANG; VANDEPERRE; CHEESEMAN, 2014). Particles of \n\npolypropylene and limestone are also present in Figure 35. M-S-H gels are clearly observed \n\n(encircled in white), showing a mesoporous (gel and capillary pores) poorly crystallized structure \n\nwith a resemblance with Calcium Silicate Hydrate(C-S-H) gels produced during Portland cement \n\nhydration. \n\nHowever, carbonated samples after 100aac present additional structures unnoticed before \n\ncarbonation curing (Figure 36). Apart from Mg(OH)2 and M-S-H gels, rosette shaped crystals are \n\nevident (encircled in yellow). In line with different authors (BEALL et al., 2013; CHEN et al., 2015; \n\nGAUTIER et al., 2014; LI et al., 2003; SUTRADHAR et al., 2011), this crystals morphology is in \n\naccordance to hydromagnesite shape which is described as rosette-like microstructure with \n\ncrystalline walls interconnected to each other (Figure 36). Also, the hydromagnesite used by Chen \n\n\n\n103 \n \n\n \n\net al. (CHEN et al., 2015) for the synthesis of forsterite matches the exhibited dimensions to those \n\npresented by the crystals of hydromagnesite in Figure 36, with extremely thin sheets of around 20 \n\nnm in thickness and less than 1 ?m inside length.  \n\nFigure 35- (a) is a SEM of a fractured surface of uncarbonated samples.

This structure is visibly different from both hydromagnesite and bigger than the rest of \n\nhydrated magnesium silicate, typical from the reaction between MgO and amorphous SiO2 in water. \n\nAlthough the unavailability of micrographic information in the literature, the presence of two \n\ndifferent amorphous phases is in line with XRD results, where part of the M-S-H gel disappear in \n\ncarbonated samples giving origin to new compounds. The existence of these new particles may be \n\ninterpreted as the result of the carbonation of M-S-H gels, supporting the hypothesis constructed \n\nfrom XRD results.  \n\n \n\n\n\n104 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 36- (a) SEM of a fractured surface of carbonated samples.

Using this technique, the Mg/Si ratio of M-S-H gel areas is measured for both carbonated \n\nand non-carbonated samples in order to determine the chemical relation between Mg and Si of \n\nthese compounds. In Figure 37 carbonated samples exhibit M-S-H gels with larger particles, such as \n\nSpectrum 2, compared to the rest of marked spectra. In Figure 37b, zoomed area from Figure 37a, \n\nthe region around Spectrum 2 presents a clearly larger structure with a particle size between 1.5-\n\n2.5??m, in contrast with the area around Spectrum 3, where smaller particles are observed (150-\n\n300 nm). Heeding the Mg/Si atomic ratio of the different considered spectra (Table 20), the value \n\n\n\n105 \n \n\n \n\nfor Spectrum 2 is 1.41, which is close to the value of lizardite or antigorite [Mg3(Si2O5)(OH)4], showing \n\na higher magnesium concentration than the areas with presence of smaller particles of M-S-H gel \n\n(0.67-0.82).  \n\nFigure 37- SEM image of a polished surface of a Carbonated composite after accelerated ageing with the different \nanalyzed spectra.

(b) represents a zoomed region of (a), where \n\ndifferent types of M-S-H gels are shown \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\nFrom Figure 38, where non-carbonated samples are displayed, a more homogenous matrix \n\nis observed, and for any region of the matrix the range of gel composition lies between Mg/Si atomic \n\nratio 1.31-1.47. This value matches the value of the bigger particles in carbonated samples (Figure \n\n37). Therefore, it can be assumed that high CO2 environments affect M-S-H particles composition, \n\nreducing their Mg/Si atomic ratio and, hence, releasing Mg2+ ions that, in presence of free water, \n\nare susceptible of being carbonated into hydromagnesite. \n\n\n\n106 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 38- SEM image of a polished surface of a Non-carbonated composite after accelerated ageing with the different \nanalyzed spectra \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\nThis decrease in Mg/Si ratio, from 1.31-1.47 to 0.67-0.82, involves an alteration in the \n\nchemical composition of the gels, changing from an arrangement like lizardite or antigorite to talc \n\n[Mg3Si4O10(OH)2] or sepiolite [Mg4Si6O15(OH)2\u00b76H2O]. This composition similar to sepiolite may \n\naccount for the increase in temperature of the endothermic peak observed in DTG analysis from \n\n110 to 135oC (Figure 34), since the loss of zeolitic and surface water of the sepiolite takes place up \n\nto 220oC, showing a peak centred about 125-135oC (BALCI, 1996; RUIZ et al., 1996; SHUALI, 1990). \n\nOn the other hand, particles with lower Mg/Si values in Figure 37 show small structures, justifying \n\nthe absence of large peaks in Figure 31, since the presence of sepiolite should result in an intense \n\npeak around 7.3o. The presence of small crystals also yields broader peaks in XRD. However, \n\ncarbonated samples show a decrease of the intensity of the humps between 32-39o and 53-63o 2?, \n\nthere is an increase in the bump from 15 to 40o 2?. This is in accordance to Cornejo and Hermos\u00edn \n\n(CORNEJO; HERMOSIN, 1988) , who generated a structural alteration of sepiolite by grinding. This \n\ncrushing causes a destruction of the original tetrahedral-octahedral linkage of the sepiolite and \n\ngenerates an amorphous material, which produced a pronounced bump from 15 to 40o 2?. Besides, \n\nthe alternation produced by grinding also increased the temperature of  the endothermic peak from \n\n105 to 135oC which is also confirmed in Figure 34. \n\n  \n\n\n\n107 \n \n\n \n\nTable 20-Average EDS values of the amorphous phases for the Uncarbonated and Carbonated samples after ageing.

In this figure, the \n\ntwo major peaks present only in carbonated samples are zoomed. These peaks are related to the \n\ndehydration and decarbonation of hydromagnesite. Based on the endothermic peaks from \n\ndifferential scanning calorimetry, the DTG peaks between 160-340oC and 450-580oC can be \n\ndeconvoluted into two minor Gaussian curves that match the different stages of both dehydration \n\nand decarbonation. The combinations of these Gaussian curves fitted the area of the obtained DTG \n\nand are used to determine the mass loss in each process. Nevertheless, the mass loss associated to \n\nhydromagnesite dehydroxylation, in the range of 375-470oC, is difficult to be established since the \n\nloss of (OH)- from hydromagnesite is overlapped with the mass loss of hydroxyl groups from \n\nMg(OH)2 (at around 410oC for non-carbonated samples) partially present in the matrix. Besides \n\npolypropylene decomposition occurs between 334 and 493oC, which hinders the intensity \n\nquantification of the peak for each component in the range of 400 and 450oC. \n\n\n\n108 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 39- DTG peak analysis of carbonated samples after ageing (C+A) and non-aged (C+NA) on the specific regions \nwhere HMC dehydration and decarbonation occur \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\nThe quantification of the peak area for each decomposition stage is shown in Table 21. From \n\nthese results no reduction is likely to take place for each peak after ageing. Although a tiny decrease \n\nin area is produced, from 3.14 to 3.05 (Table 21), in the dehydration peak for aged samples (C+A), \n\nthe area obtained from HMC decarbonation for aged samples is higher than for non-carbonated \n\nsamples, increasing from 4.68 to 5.04 (Table 21). Considering the total area corresponding to both \n\ndecomposition processes, this value is also higher for aged samples which is in accordance with a \n\nreduction of Mg(OH)2 for carbonated samples after ageing (C+A), as proved by XRD (Figure 31). \n\nConsidering that the ageing cycles used in this study simulates severe weather conditions, including \n\nintense temperature variations (from 20 to 60oC in 10 min), it is possible to affirm that no reverse \n\nreaction from carbonated to uncarbonated phase happens. Probably the reasonable explanation for \n\nthis product stability is that the main HMC crystal found in this study keeps a major resemblance \n\nwith hydromagnesite instead of nesquehonite, as stated by Unluer and Al-Tabbaa (UNLUER; AL-\n\n\n\n109 \n \n\n \n\nTABBAA, 2014) and after discussed elsewhere (UNLUER; AL-TABBAA, 2016; WALLING; PROVIS, \n\n2016). \n\nTable 21- Parameters of the different Gaussian curves obtained to quantify the mass loss from dehydration and \n\ndecarbonation processes of the HMC in both peaks.

Although non-significant differences may be observed, both carbonated \n\nsamples (unaged and aged) present higher MOR and lower SE values (Table 22). Concerning the \n\nmatrix performance and, thus, the cement mechanical properties, the flexural parameters that offer \n\nthe conclusive information are MOE and LOP (BENTUR; MINDESS, 2007). Regardless carbonation, \n\nboth formulations suffer a statistical significant reduction of MOE after ageing: approximately 25% \n\nand 38% for carbonated and uncarbonated respectively. This loss of rigidity may be associated to \n\nthe conversion of Mg(OH)2, that is the result of the expansive reaction from MgO and H2O, into \n\nother hydrated phases: M-S-H gels for uncarbonated samples (JIN; AL-TABBAA, 2014; LI et al., 2014; \n\nSZCZERBA et al., 2013; ZHANG; CHEESEMAN; VANDEPERRE, 2011; ZHANG; VANDEPERRE; \n\nCHEESEMAN, 2014) and magnesium carbonates for carbonated samples (BOTHA; STRYDOM, 2001, \n\n2003; FERN\u00c1NDEZ et al., 1999; NDUAGU et al., 2012; UNLUER; AL-TABBAA, 2014). In spite of the \n\nreduction of the stiffness in carbonated samples after ageing, carbonation has a positive effect on \n\nthe matrix since LOP increases at the same age. The end of the elastic region (LOP) in fibre-cement \n\ncomposites is considered as the maximum load that is resisted mainly by the cementitious matrix \n\n\n\n110 \n \n\n \n\n(BENTUR; MINDESS, 2007). Consequently, an increase in LOP can be related to an improvement of \n\nthe mechanical strength of the matrix. In view of the results, carbonation of the MgO-SiO2 systems \n\nin composites with vegetable fibres enhances the mechanical performance of the cement. \n\nCompared to previous works where carbonation of Portland cement is used to improve and \n\npreserve the mechanical properties of cementitious products reinforced with vegetable fibre \n\n(ALMEIDA et al., 2013), MOR results obtained in this study are lower. These differences in MOR \n\nvalues may be due to lower short fibres content (3% in this study compared with 10% used by \n\n(ALMEIDA et al., 2013) which generates a different number of reinforcing elements. However, the \n\nvalues reported by Almeida et al. showed lower values of specific energy compared with those \n\nobtained in this work, which can be attributed to the content of long fibres, polypropylene, allowing \n\ngreater energy dissipation by pull-out. In this study, the energy absorbed during bending test is \n\nconserved without loss of deformation and resistance. These results are consistent with those \n\nobtained by Khorami et al (KHORAMI; GANJIAN; SRIVASTAV, 2016) where samples reinforced with \n\nPP fibres experienced a large deformation due to the large tensile deformation of these fibres. \n\nHowever according to Khorami et al, PP fibres did not provide a satisfactory performance as \n\nreinforcing elements, since in spite of improving ductility and toughness, flexural strength declined. \n\nIn another work where PP fibres and pulp pine are used as reinforcement elements of fibre-\n\ncement (BEZERRA; JOAQUIM; SAVASTANO JR, 2004), mechanical results are lower than those \n\nobtained in this experiment, for both MOR and SE. This indicates the efficiency of the matrix used \n\nin this study and the viability to use PP as reinforcement fibres, which generally provide ineffective \n\nmechanical performance. \n\nThe parameter that decreases in a significant manner for both carbonated formulations is \n\nSD. This phenomenon is commonly associated to the modification of the interfacial transition zone \n\n(ITZ) between matrix and fibre. Though carbonation has been reported to have a positive filling \n\neffect and  to reduce porosity in cement composites, it also densifies the ITZ (PIZZOL et al., 2014; \n\nSANTOS et al., 2015a). This fact is also reinforced by the significant reduction of the apparent \n\nporosity after carbonation (Table 24), achieving a decline of the porosity of up to 38%, and \n\nsimultaneously increasing the bulk density of the whole composite. The densification of the ITZ is \n\none of the causes of the fracture mechanism modification in fibre-reinforced cementitious products \n\n(TOLEDO FILHO et al., 2000; SAVASTANO; WARDEN; COUTTS, 2005), where less-dense interfaces are \n\n\n\n111 \n \n\n \n\nprone to pull-out and thus energy absorption, while denser transition zones trend to higher fibre-\n\nmatrix adherence, promoting the fibre collapse.  \n\nAnother possible explanation for the reduction of SD is the first tension that fibre \n\nreinforcements begin to resist. Considering the statistical higher LOP values for carbonated samples, \n\nreinforcement elements within these formulations are initially loaded at superior levels than in the \n\ncase of non-carbonated samples at the first cracking episode. Thus, the fact of beginning to resist \n\nhigher tension values makes those fibres in carbonated samples do not elongate as much as fibres \n\nin non-carbonated samples. However, this ductility lessening does not affect the toughness of the \n\ncarbonated samples since there is no significant difference between carbonated samples and \n\nuncarbonated samples for both aged and unaged samples. \n\nTable 22- Modulus of rupture, specific energy (at MOR) and specific deflection (at MOR) values for the different studied \n\nformulations.

The first benefit is the decrease of apparent porosity, which is especially \n\nimportant for fibre-cement elements reinforced with cellulosic fibres since products with less \n\napparent pores are more effective against any chemical or biological attack (BENTUR; MINDESS, \n\n2007). Another advantage is the decline of water absorption. This aspect is particularly useful for \n\nthe main current application of fibre-cement products: roofing elements. Low water absorbent \n\nproducts are more resistant against freeze-thaw cycles (BENTUR; MINDESS, 2007) and water \n\npermeability, improving durability of building materials under direct exposure to the natural \n\nweather. Besides in this study by the application of accelerated ageing (100 soak-dry cycles), \n\nextremely aggressive environmental conditions are simulated, combining stages of high \n\ntemperature (60oC) and low humidity (ventilated oven) with immersion (rainy) periods.  The effect \n\nof carbonation of MgO-SiO2 systems supposes an improvement that allows obtaining values of AP, \n\nBD WA and similar to those obtained with Portland cement composites (BEZERRA; JOAQUIM; \n\nSAVASTANO JR, 2004). \n\n  \n\n\n\n113 \n \n\n \n\nTable 24- Apparent porosity (AP), bulk density (BD) and water absorption (WA) values for the different formulations \n \n\n  \nAP (% by volume) BD (g/cm3) WA (% by mass) \n\n  Unaged Aged Unaged Aged Unaged Aged \n\nUncarbonated x? 36.95 a, A 37.39 a, A 1.48 a, A 1.45 a, A 25.02 a, A 25.83 a, A \n? 0.79  1.12  0.03  0.03  1.00  1.34  \n\nCarbonated x? 26.78 b, A 30.72 b, B 1.69 b, A 1.62 b, B 15.84 b, A 18.94 b, B \n\n? 1.11  1.01  0.03  0.03  0.88  0.99  \nSame lower case letters in the same column mean no statistical significant difference. \n\nSame capital letters in the same row mean no significant statistical significant difference. \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n4.4 BLOCK 4 \n\n4.4.1 Paste tests \n\n4.4.1.1 Hydration of the  pastes and dynamic MOE results \n\nFrom Figure 40, it is possible to observe how samples containing sepiolite increase MOE \n\nmean values regardless the amount and type of sepiolite. Comparing different types of sepiolite, \n\nsamples with CIMSIL sepiolite present higher elastic modulus than samples with PANGEL. For both \n\ntypes of sepiolite samples the higher content in sepiolite the higher MOE values. PC samples have \n\nhigher mean MOE values than MgO-SiO2 samples but 2% CIMSIL is the treatment that presents \n\nhigher values from day 5. \n\n  \n\n\n\n114 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 40- Evolution of hydrated pastes Dynamic Flexural Young Modulus over time with a steam curing at 55oC \n\ndepending on the sepiolite replacement. 0% stands for MgO-SiO2 samples with no sepiolite replacement.

The rest of the samples indicate the percentage and type of sepiolite \n\nreplacement. \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\nRegarding the hydration degree by comparing TG and DTG curves and XRD spectra (Figure \n\n41 and Figure 42), samples containing CIMSIL sepiolite does not modify significantly the amount of \n\nhydrated phases compared to samples without sepiolite, though little reduction of unreacted MgO \n\nand MH is perceived and M-S-H gel content slightly increases. Although, the mechanical \n\nimprovement of the pastes, the little chemical effect of CIMSIL sepiolite on the paste hydration \n\nconfirms its inactivity as pozzolanic material (HE; MAKOVICKY; OSB\u00c6CK, 1996). \n\nSamples containing PANGEL sepiolite, however, clearly decreases the amount of unreacted \n\nMgO and MH with a well-defined increase in the M-S-H gel content. This is especially remarkable \n\nfor 1% PANGEL samples, which does not show any trace of unreacted MgO in its spectrum and \n\nshows little peaks corresponding to MH, displaying an almost identic XRD spectra pattern and TG \n\ncurve of M-S-H synthetized gel (BREW; GLASSER, 2005; LI et al., 2014; ZHANG; CHEESEMAN; \n\nVANDEPERRE, 2011; ZHANG; VANDEPERRE; CHEESEMAN, 2014). This may be explained because of \n\nthe greater water demand either of PANGEL samples or due to the lower anionic charge. According \n\nto (ZHANG; VANDEPERRE; CHEESEMAN, 2014), where  magnesium silicate hydrate (M-S-H) cement \n\n\n\n115 \n \n\n \n\npastes are obtained using sodium hexametaphosphate as deflocculant, samples with higher w/c \n\nratio are expected to show a greater hydration degree at the same age. In this case, since its large \n\nspecific surface, finer sepiolite provides wet condition that favors the magnesia-silica reaction, as \n\nhappens with pozzolanic reaction (ANDREJKOVIC\u00d4V\u00c1, 2011). \n\nAlso, the higher zeta-potential of CIMSIL has an electrostatic stabilizing effect upon the \n\ncement paste, thus reducing the hydration rate of these samples (N\u00c4GELE; SCHNEIDER, 1989). Given \n\nthe greater specific surface of PANGEL sepiolite (Table 10), this could act as a stronger nucleation \n\nseeding effect resulting in a faster hydration as it can be seen in Figure 43c, where needle-shaped \n\nparticles of PANGEL sepiolite are tightly adhered on the surface of well-packed particles of M-S-H \n\ngels. This is also supported by (KAVAS; SABAH; \u00c7ELIK, 2004) that reported the capability of sepiolite \n\nto absorb more alkaline compounds since its higher surface area. However, in the case of CIMSIL \n\nsamples (Figure 43b), sepiolite microfibres are linking loose M-S-H particles which suggests a prior \n\ngel growth and later physical attachment with the fibres. \n\n  \n\n\n\n116 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 41- TG and DTG results of the hydrated pastes depending on the type of sepiolite addition used: (a) CIMSIL (b) \n\nPANGEL. 0% stands for MgO-SiO2 samples with no sepiolite replacement.

Adding CaCO3 to MgO-SiO2 mixture slightly decreases the \n\nchord size before flocculant addition, and does not affect the chord size after flocculant addition \n\nand decreases floc stability, reducing chord size at deflocculation stage beginning (840 s). When \n\nundelaminated sepiolite is added to MgO-SiO2 suspension (Figure 44b), chord size at every stage for \n\nevery mix design slightly decreases, being further reduced for CIMSIL samples and 2% sepiolite \n\ncontent samples. \n\nFigure 44- Evolution of the mean chord size of 18.4 g of powder suspensions in 400 mL of water according to Table 11. \nFlocculation evolution is displayed in (a) for MgO-SiO2 powder is displayed with and without filler addition, in (b) for \n\nMgO-SiO2 powder with filler addition and undelaminated sepiolte replacements, in (c) for MgO-SiO2 powder with filler \naddition and delaminated sepiolte replacements, (d) for PC is displayed with and without filler addition, in (e) for PC with \n\nfiller addition and undelaminated sepiolte replacements and in (f) for PC with filler addition and delaminated sepiolte \nreplacements\n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n119 \n \n\n \n\n The addition of delaminated sepiolite to MgO-SiO2 powder (Figure 44c) increases the chord \n\nsize at the flocculation stage for 1% sepiolite gel content samples, while it is reduced for 2% sepiolite \n\ngel content samples. Shorter chord size is obtained when PANGEL sepiolite is used. When PC \n\nsuspension is analyzed (Figure 44d), a mean chord size of 22 ?m before flocculant addition and 108 \n\n?m after flocculant addition (max. chord size) is shown. Adding CaCO3 to PC powder slightly \n\ndecreases the chord size before flocculant addition (to 18 ?m) and at every stage. In contrast to \n\nMgO-SiO2 samples, undelaminated sepiolite in PC suspension (Figure 44e) does not significantly \n\naffect the chord size at any stage. However, when sepiolite is delaminated (Figure 44f), PC \n\nsuspensions chord size is strongly increased at flocculation stage, boosted immediately after \n\nflocculant addition. More chord floc stability is achieved for 1% sepiolite gel content samples, \n\nkeeping longer chord size even at the beginning of the deflocculation stage. Only 1% sepiolite gel \n\ncontent samples, both CIMSIL and PANGEL, retain higher chord size during deflocculation and keep \n\nit as high as control samples during reflocculation stages.  \n\n The addition of undelaminated sepiolite to MgO-SiO2 powder dispersed in a pine pulp \n\nsuspension is displayed in Figure 45a. Undelaminated sepiolite does not significantly affects the \n\nchord size after flocculant addition, however somewhat increases floc stability, yielding rather \n\nlonger flocs after both deflocculation and reflocculation. Further chord size increase is achieved by \n\nCIMSIL samples. Contrarily to undelaminated sepiolite, delaminated sepiolite (Figure 45b) intensely \n\nrises chord size at every stage ans shows similar performance for every formulation regardless \n\nsepiolite type and content. It also causes a reflocculation event during flocculation stage, after a \n\nfaster floc size reduction and slight floc size regrowth. Considering the addition of undelaminated \n\nsepiolite to PC powder dispersed in a pine pulp suspension (Figure 45c), no significant effect is \n\nobserved after flocculant addition, still slightly increases floc stability, yielding rather longer flocs \n\nduring reflocculation. Little further chord size increase is displayed by CIMSIL samples and 2% \n\nsepiolite content samples. In the case of delaminated sepiolite in PC powder dispersed in a pine pulp \n\nsuspension (d), chord size at every stage is intensely raised, regardless sepiolite type and content. \n\nAs happened with MgO-SiO2 suspension, a reflocculation event during flocculation stage, after a \n\nfaster floc size reduction and slight floc size regrowth takes place. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n120 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 45- Evolution of the mean chord size of 18.4 g of powder + 1.6 g of pine pulp suspensions in 400 mL of water \naccording to Table 11.

Comparing drainage curves of MgO-SiO2 (a) and PC (b) \n\nsuspensions, MgO-SiO2 samples drain less water (ranging from 41-54%) compared to PC samples \n\n(55-60.5%), so MgO-SiO2 matrices retain more water for every formulation. When flocculant to the \n\nsuspensions, the amount of final drained water for both types of suspension is reduced, from 60.5 \n\nto 59.75 % for PC samples and from 54 to 47g for MgO-SiO2 samples. However, it increases the \n\ndrainage speed, rising the percentage of drained water after 10s from 79 to 85% for PC samples and \n\nfrom 71 to 78% for MgO-SiO2 samples.  \n\nConsidering the addition of delaminated sepiolite to MgO-SiO2 mixture dispersed in a pine \n\npulp suspension (Figure 46a) it is observed that it decreases the amount of drained water from the \n\nsamples but for samples with 1% CIMSIL. The amount of drained water is mainly reduced by samples \n\ncontaining PANGEL sepiolite, where the greatest reduction is shown by 2% PANGEL sepiolite \n\ncontent. However, it increases the drainage speed, rising the amount of drained water after 10 s for \n\nevery sample. When delaminated sepiolite is added to PC suspensions (Figure 46b), the amount of \n\n\n\n122 \n \n\n \n\ndrained water for every sample is reduced. Further drainage reduction is shown by 2% sepiolite \n\ncontent samples. Sepiolite in PC suspensions also reduces the drainage speed, dropping the amount \n\nof drained water after 10 s for every sample. 1% sepiolite content samples have similar drainage \n\nvalues (230 g aprox. after 100 s) and drainage speed after 10 s (35% aprox.). 2% PANGEL sepiolite \n\ncontent samples present faster drainage (65% after 10 s) compared to the rest of the samples with \n\nsepiolite addition, although the total amount of water (220 g after 100 s) is similar of the 2% CIMSIL \n\nsepiolite content samples, which have the slowest drainage at 10 s (29%). \n\n \n\n4.4.2.3 Flexural tests \n\nAccording to flexural tests, when MgO-SiO2 cement is replaced in 1% by mass of CIMSIL \n\nsepiolite, all the mechanical parameters are increased except MOE. The rest of the replacements do \n\nnot improve any parameter. The addition of sepiolite reduces the coefficient of variation for every \n\nstudied parameter in most of the studied compositions. This is closely related to a more \n\nhomogeneous composite. The only composition that is not in accordance with this trend is the one \n\nwith 1% of PANGEL sepiolite. The properties related to the binder matrix rigidity (LOP and MOE) are \n\nmore variable for this composition. The addition of PANGEL sepiolite yields lower flexural \n\nperformance than CIMSIL sepiolite. Even at 2% by mass replacement, CIMSIL samples offer higher \n\nflexural properties compared to PANGEL samples. \n\n  \n\n\n\n123 \n \n\n \n\nTable 25 - Flexural results of every formulation after 5 days curing at 55oC.

However, samples with 2% of CIMSIL sepiolite retain more water after \n\ndrainage which leads to a higher w/c ratio and therefore to lower composite properties. This greater \n\nwater retention is also reproduced by PANGEL samples, with both 1 and 2% replacement, which \n\npromotes lower performance composites.  \n\nRegarding the flocculation of the samples (Figure 45), samples with 2% of PANGEL sepiolite \n\npresent a superior chord size than 1% PANGEL samples. Bigger flocs are related to better connected \n\nfibre nets so samples with larger flocs also offer better properties related to the binder rigidity. This \n\nfactor explains the superior flexural performance of samples with 2% of PANGEL despite of having \n\n\n\n124 \n \n\n \n\na higher w/c ratio than 1% PANGEL samples. Besides, the larger floc size may be linked to the greater \n\nbending capacity of the 1% CIMSIL samples compared to the MgO-SiO2 samples with no sepiolite \n\nadded. \n\nFigure 47- Stress-deflection curves of the most representative sample of each composite composition. 0% stands for \nMgO-SiO2 samples with no sepiolite replacement.

The rest \n\nof the samples indicate the percentage and type of sepiolite replacement \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\nFrom Figure 47 and Table 25, MgO-SiO2 samples with no addition of sepiolite (0%) have \n\nsimilar MOR as PC samples and also present similar characteristics related to the matrix \n\nperformance (MOE and LOP). Nevertheless, properties related to the efficiency of the reinforcing \n\nelements are slightly lower for MgO-SiO2 samples. This may be attributed to a worse fibre-matrix \n\ninterface, since water retention is higher for MgO-SiO2 samples which promotes more porous areas \n\nin the interface transition zone (ITZ). A clear example of porous ITZ is exhibited with the addition of \n\nsepiolite to the MgO-SiO2 binding systems, excluding 1% CIMSIL samples. Samples with sepiolite \n\nshow similar trend to PC and 0% samples at the initial stages of the flexural test. In the beginning, \n\nwhen stresses are mainly resisted by the matrix, all samples behave in an identical manner, yet when \n\nloads exceed LOP and are transferred to the fibres, samples with sepiolite reach earlier their MOR \n\nand are quickly deflected at lower flexural stresses. Considering that the main difference between \n\nthe samples is the retained water, this lack of toughness shown by sepiolite formulated samples in \n\n\n\n125 \n \n\n \n\nthe plastic zone of the curve may be attributed to an extra porosity in the ITZ that disturbs the \n\nproper transmission of loads from matrix to fibres. \n\n4.4.2.4 Composite images \n\nIn Figure 48, where fibres are centered in the middle of SEM images taken from every \n\nsample with sepiolite replacement, it is observed how the reinforcing fibre in 1% CIMSIL samples (a) \n\npresents failures, even exposing the lumen, in contrast to what happens with the rest of the samples \n\n(b, c and d), that show an intact fibre. The rest of the samples also show higher emptiness between \n\nmatrix and fibre, as a consequence of the larger porosity of these samples. Imperfections in the fibre \n\nobserved in 1% CIMSIL sample (a) comes from necking episodes in the fibre after larger deflections. \n\nFor this reason, effects on the fibre related to necking events generate higher SE performance of \n\nthe composite, since the fibre requires more energy to be pulled out from the matrix. \n\nFigure 48- SEM images of the surroundings of reinforcing fibres for each composition with sepiolite: (a) CIMSIL 1%, (b) \n\nCIMSIL 2%, (c) PANGEL 1% and (d) PANGEL 2%\n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n\n\n126 \n \n\n \n\n4.4.2.5 Physical tests \n\nPhysical tests performed on samples after flexural tests (Table 26), results confirm the \n\ntrends observed with mechanical results, indicating that PC samples are denser and less porous due \n\nto the lower water retention values compared to MgO-SiO2 samples.

Thus, TGA was carried out to analyse the \n\nthermal decomposition of sisal fibres after different ageing conditions. In Figure 49, TG and DTG \n\ncurves of sisal are displayed and it is possible to observe different decomposition behaviours \n\naccording to the different ageing situations. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n127 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 49- TG/DTG thermograms of sisal fibres both unaged and aged, both in MgO-SiO2 (MS) and Portland cement (PC), \n\nfor 5 months. Circles match the different peaks obtained in DTG curves \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\nRaw sisal fibres DTG curve reveals two major peaks and a minor one at around 75oC, \n\nresulting from the loss of absorbed water in the fibre (intra and intermolecular dehydration \n\nreactions) (FAIRBRIDGE; ROSS; SOOD, 1978). From the major peaks, the first one is attributed to \n\nhemicellulose and cellulose degradation (between 200 to 400oC). The second peak is related to the \n\ndecomposition of the char (between 425 and 530oC) produced during the pyrolysis of the previous \n\ncomponents in an oxidative environment (FAIRBRIDGE; ROSS; SOOD, 1978; MARTIN et al., 2010). \n\nSisal fibre degradation approximately started at around 195oC and took place rapidly with the \n\ntemperature increase until 385oC. In the range of 320-345oC a maximum value of the DTG is \n\nobserved (Figure 49), attributable to the decomposition of cellulose (Figure 52). In addition, during \n\nthis degradation process, DTG curve displays a shoulder at around 295oC due to the hemicellulose \n\ndegradation. This shoulder suggests that two different thermal decomposition steps are overlapped. \n\nRegarding lignin degradation, it is not possible to infer any conclusion since lignin content in sisal \n\nfibres is reduced compared with holocellulose content and this process of degradation takes place \n\nevenly from 180 to 344oC. Also lignin DTG maximum peak is produced at 205oC according to \n\n\n\n128 \n \n\n \n\n(BEN\u00cdTEZ-GUERRERO et al., 2014), which is overlapped in between the maximum of both \n\nhemicellulose (286.8oC) and cellulose (325.4oC) as seen in Figure 52. \n\nExposing sisal fibre to MgO-SiO2 cement for 5 months changes the thermal decomposition \n\nof the fibres.  The intensity of the DTG maximum peak is increased, which is related to cellulose \n\nfraction increase. Along with that, the shoulder at about 295oC vanishes. This behaviour is similar to \n\nsisal fibres when are treated with NaOH solution (ZHOU; CHENG; JIANG, 2014). In this alkali \n\nenvironment, pectin and hemicellulose are reduced. \n\nHowever, in fibres submitted to PC environment all the peaks decrease their intensity and \n\nshoulder remains. This reduction in the hemicellulose and cellulose decomposition is associated to \n\ntheir content reduction, as consequence of alkaline hydrolysis of amorphous holocellulose and lignin \n\n(WEI; MEYER, 2014). Also, considering Figure 50, where both PC and MgO-SiO2 samples are analysed \n\nby thermogravimetry, PC samples after 5 months show a peak between 520-760oC, which matches \n\nthe DTG peak shown by fibres after 5 months in PC curve around that temperature. This peak in \n\nPortland cement, at 520-760oC, is due to the CO2 released during calcium carbonate decomposition \n\n(DWECK et al., 2000). However, CaCO3 is not a direct product from cement hydration reactions and \n\ncomes instead from the reaction between Ca(OH)2 and environmental CO2 (ARANDIGOYEN; \n\n\u00c1LVAREZ, 2006). Moreover, since CaCO3 has less solubility than Ca(OH)2, the presence of CaCO3 in \n\nthe fibres is explained by the mineralization in the lumen of the fibre from the Ca2+ ions absorbed \n\nby the fibres in an aqueous suspension. The mineralization of the fibres is even more developed \n\nafter 400 accelerating ageing cycles exposure, since fibres exposed in PC present a bigger CaCO3 \n\npeak. This process in sisal fibres in PC environments is avoided by using MgO-SIO2 instead, where \n\nno traces of hardened pasted is registered in the fibres. \n\n\n\n129 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 50- TG/DTG thermograms of MgO-SiO2 (MS) and Portland cement (PC) after 5 months \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\nFigure 51- TG/DTG thermograms of sisal fibres both unaged and after 400 accelerated ageing cycles in, both MgO-SiO2 \n\n(MS) and Portland cement (PC).

Exposing fibres to MgO-SIO2 environment reduces hemicellulose content while \n\ncellulose remains at higher concentration than unaged sisal fibres. However, PC exposure initially (5 \n\nmonths ageing) affects amorphous cellulose and after 400 accelerated ageing cycles both \n\nhemicellulose and cellulose are further reduced. \n\n \n\nFigure 52- Mass loss of each component of sisal fibres both unaged and after ageing (5 months and 400 accelerated \n\nageing cycles) in MgO-SiO2 (MS) and Portland cement (PC). Circles match the different peaks obtained in DTG curves \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\nAccording to activation energy (Figure 53) results obtained from thermogravimetric \n\nanalysis, it is possible to observe a relationship between fibre composition and the energy required \n\nto decompose the fibre. Even though holocellulose is considered a two-step decomposition process, \n\nhemicellulose first and then cellulose, activation energy is strongly influenced by the cellulose \n\ncontent rather than by the holocellulose. Figure 53 displays how the higher cellulose content \n\nsamples present the higher activation energy for aged samples. Thus, samples aged in MgO-SiO2 \n\n\n\n131 \n \n\n \n\ncement keep high activation energy even after 400aac since cellulose content is increased and most \n\nof the amorphous components are removed. Contrary to this, when fibres are exposed to PC, they \n\npresent the lower activation energy. However, this difference in activation energy is not enough to \n\nexplain the decay of the mechanical performance of the fibres after ageing  previously reported \n\nwhen cellulosic pulps were applied in fibre-cement composites in Block 2 or (M\u00c1RMOL; \n\nSAVASTANO, 2017). \n\nFigure 53- Quadruple axis diagram with activation energy results according to the different methods used in \n\nthermograms (left axis) and mass loss fraction of cellulose and holocellulose (right axis) \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\n4.5.2 XRD analysis \n\nX-ray spectrograms in Figure 54 display the effect of the different cement environment \n\nexposure on the sisal fibres crystallography. XRD patterns of untreated and aged fibres after 5 \n\nmonths and 400 accelerated ageing cycles for both Portland and MgO-SIiO2 cement are shown. In \n\nevery sample, three bumps are marked with full black circles at around 14.8, 16.4 and 22.6 o, \n\nmatching the (110), (1-10) and (200) diffraction planes of cellulose I? polymorphism respectively \n\n(BARRETO et al., 2011). Contrary to what happens in crystalline cellulose samples, as hemp fibres \n\n\n\n132 \n \n\n \n\n(OUAJAI; SHANKS, 2005), sisal fibres spectra show one broad peak that unifies the two diffraction \n\npeaks around 14.8 o and 16.4 o. The spectra are alike for most of the samples but the samples covered \n\nwith Portland cement for 400 accelerated ageing cycles. The rest of the samples embedded in \n\ncement show higher peaks. This increase in intensity proves that amorphous phases of the fibres \n\nwere removed and cellulose remains in higher concentration. Only fibres in Portland cement after \n\naccelerated ageing present a reduced cellulose concentration. Also higher holocellulose \n\ndegradation is registered by thermogravimetric techniques. \n\n \n\nFigure 54- X-ray diffraction patterns of untreated and aged sisal fibres, after 5 months and 400 accelerated ageing cycles, \n\nin both MgO-SiO2 (MS) and Portland cement (PC) \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\n \n\nRegarding cellulose crystallinity (\u00a1Error! No se encuentra el origen de la referencia.), Ic was i\n\nncreased for every sample surrendered by alkaline matrices. When sisal fibres are exposed to \n\nalkaline atmospheres, crystalline cellulose fraction increases since amorphous cellulose is also \n\neliminated (FERNANDES; MANO; REIS, 2013). Even after 400 accelerated ageing cycles in Portland \n\ncement, crystallinity is higher than unaged fibres, which suggests that cellulose crystallinity after \n\nageing is preserved. However in PC samples, after 400 cycles, cellulose crystallinity is lower than \n\nsamples after 5 months of ageing, indicating a decay of crystallinity over time. This increase in \n\n\n\n133 \n \n\n \n\ncellulose crystallinity for samples aged in MgO-SIO2 cement is considered to be beneficial for sisal \n\nfibres, since it ensures high strength and durability of fibres in cementitious materials (WEI; MEYER, \n\n2014). \n\n \n\n Crystallinity Index, Ic    Crystallite size parameters \n\n Peak height (%) \nAmorphous \n\nsubstraction (%)  \n  2q (o) FWHM (o) ???\u00c5? \n\nUntreated 80,63 52,54   22,40 2,69 33,43 \n\nSisal MS 5 82,69 57,41  22,35 2,59 34,72 \n\nSisal PC 5 82,25 62,07  22,28 2,47 36,40 \n\nSisal MS400 84,37 61,25  22,41 2,47 36,41 \n\nSisal PC 400 81,81 58,26   22,48 2,45 36,71 \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\nAccording to Figure 54, every sample increases crystallite size values. This is in contrast to \n\nwhat is reported to happen when cellulosic fibres are submitted to high alkaline solutions, where \n\ncrystallite size is reduced (LING et al., 2017). Although crystallite size increase is not elevated, it is \n\nenough to assure that no decrease takes place. One of the mechanisms of degradation of sisal fibres \n\nproposed when used in cementitious materials is the alkaline hydrolysis (MELO FILHO; SILVA; \n\nTOLEDO FILHO, 2013) ,which yields breakdown of cellulose chains, so a reduction of crystallite size \n\noccurs. Based on TG and DTG results, when sisal fibres are aged in Portland cement, there is a \n\nreduction of cellulose content in the samples that is related to cellulose hydrolysis (BALLESTEROS et \n\nal., 2017). However, this reduction in cellulose fraction is not related to a reduction of the crystallite \n\nsize, showing that crystallinity of cellulose is not affected after ageing. On the other hand, this \n\nincrement in crystallite size may be explained by the swelling reaction between alkalis and cellulose \n\nfibres, during which a relaxation of the cellulose crystalline structure occurs. Another reason for this \n\ncrystallite size increment is the immobilization of alkalis due to their mineralization and deposition \n\non the fibre surface after reacting with the rest of fibre components such as hemicellulose and lignin. \n\n \n\nAccording to different authors (MELO FILHO; SILVA; TOLEDO FILHO, 2013; MOHR; \n\nBIERNACKI; KURTIS, 2006), another factor for cellulose degradation that is also confirmed by XRD is \n\nthe crystallization of lime in the fibres. For samples embedded in Portland cement, a different peak \n\nis noticeable on the diffractogram after 5 months of ageing and plainly recognizable after 400 \n\n\n\n134 \n \n\n \n\naccelerated ageing cycles at around 29.5o, as well as minor peaks 36.1 and 39.6o. These peaks \n\npresent only in sisal fibres when aged in Portland cement match calcite diffractogram (CaCO3) \n\nformed by the carbonation of Ca(OH)2. In addition, another calcite peak is overlapped with (2 0 0) \n\ncellulose diffraction plane at around (29.5). CaCO3 sharpens this peak and, therefore, reduces its \n\nFWHM, so crystallite size is increased even after accelerated ageing. However, samples aged in \n\nMgO-SiO2 cement do not present any extra peaks from those original present in unaged sisal fibres. \n\nConsequently, mineralization process is avoided by using this new type of cement.  \n\n \n\n4.5.3 DSC analysis \n\nFigure 55- DSC curves of sisal fibres both unaged and after 5 months ageing and 400 accelerated ageing cycles in both \n\nMgO-SiO2 (MS) and Portland cement (PC) \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\nFigure 55 displays DSC trends of sisal as received and aged in both MgO-SiO2 and PC. \n\nTemperature scale is set in the 200-400oC range since previous to 200oC only dehydration process \n\ntakes place from moisture, according to (CHAND et al., 1987), and energy involved is also related to \n\ncement decomposition process.  For every sample, there is a well-defined exothermic peak from \n\n\n\n135 \n \n\n \n\ncellulose degradation process. Dehydration of holocellulose molecules at lower temperatures \n\n(CHAND et al., 1987) is followed by splitting of hydroxyl groups in oxidative atmosphere \n\n(SHAFIZADEH; BRADBURY, 1979). From 400oC onwards, char from oxidation is produced. Unaged \n\nsisal peak is centred at around 327oC (Figure 55). When ageing in MgO-SiO2 is applied, exothermic \n\npeak is slightly increased to higher temperatures, to 330 and 335oC after 400 aac and 5 months \n\nrespectively (Figure 55). Since hemicellulose and lignin degradation starts before cellulose (YANG et \n\nal., 2007; ZHOU; CHENG; JIANG, 2014), increasing temperatures of the peak centre indicates a higher \n\ncellulose content.  \n\nWhen sisal fibres are aged in PC for 5 months, energy intensity as well as peak centre \n\ntemperature are decreased. This indicates that the lower the cellulose content, the lower the \n\nenthalpy energy. However, after accelerated ageing (400 cycles), both peak intensity and \n\ntemperature at the centre are increased (Figure 55). Thus, cellulose fraction is recovered since \n\namorphous materials are removed and crystallinity is preserved, as previously stated from TG, DTG \n\nand DRX results.  \n\n \n\n4.5.4 SEM and EDS analysis \n\nSamples exposed to MgO-SiO2 for 5 months, shown in Figure 56a, present a well preserved \n\nstructure compared to unaged sisal fibres (Figure 56d). Neither cell walls nor lamella are damaged \n\nin contrast to fibres embedded in PC for 5months (Figure 56b), where cracks start from the lumen \n\nand are spread outwards though the cell walls. This breakage of cell tissues (cellulose mainly) after \n\n5 months in PC is in accordance to TG results where a decrease of cellulose is reported and it is \n\nclearly related to lower activation energy. Besides, samples in PC at this same age (Figure 56c and f) \n\nreveal that lignin and hemicellulose microfibrils suffer a breakage so a debonding process between \n\nmicrofibres is initiated.  \n\n\n\n136 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 56- SEM images of sisal fibres embedded in epoxy resin after ageing.

This disaggregation goes along with by the precipitation of \n\ncompounds from the cement matrix between the microfibres (Figure 57c). By EDS mapping (Figure \n\n57d) it is inferred that those compounds are Ca rich so this precipitation, matches perfectly with the \n\nXRD results, where CaCO3 is identified. EDS results also reveal another important detail since Ca rich \n\nzones match C poor zones which can be related with the presence of other compounds with no C. \n\nThese compounds, also reported by other authors as portlandite [Ca(OH)2], undergo a carbonation \n\nprocess to form CaCO3. Fibre fragilization is attributed to these Ca compounds, so mechanical \n\nperformance thereof is severely decrease. The embrittlement of the fibres due to the presence of \n\nCa-based combinations is responsible for the lack of long term reinforcing capacity of sisal fibres in \n\ncementitious components.  \n\nIn the case of samples aged for 400 accelerated ageing cycles in MgO-SiO2 cement (Figure \n\n58c and d) no sign of disaggregation is observed and no compounds are precipitated between the \n\nmicrofibres, which may be related to a preservation of the mechanical properties of the fibres and, \n\ntherefore, a maintenance of their reinforcing capacity. Despite no presenting any traces of hydrated \n\nphases bonded to surface at 5 months (Figure 58a and b), in samples after 400 aac by EDS mapping \n\nit is displayed the presence of Mg particles bonded to the surface of the fibres. This may be explained \n\nby the evolution of the hydration reaction of the cement over time, that generates more hydrated \n\ncompounds after 400aac (M\u00c1RMOL et al., 2016). However, it is important to notice that these \n\ncompounds are also rich in Si, which suggest the presence of M-S-H gel particles surrounding the \n\nfibres. This is of relevance, since it proves a good adherence between M-S-H gel, that are the main \n\nresponsible for the good mechanical performance of MgO-SiO2 cement, and lignocellulosic fibres, \n\nwith no signs of degradation even after 400 accelerated ageing. \n\n  \n\n\n\n138 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 57- SEM images and EDS mapping of sisal fibres embedded in epoxy resin at different ageing times exposed to PC. \n\n(a) SEM of samples after 5 months in PC, (b) EDS mapping of samples after 5 months in PC, (c) SEM of samples after 400 \n\naccelerated ageing cycles in PC and (d) EDS mapping of samples after 400 accelerated ageing cycles in PC \n\n \n\nSource: Own creation \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n139 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 58- SEM images and EDS mapping of sisal fibres embedded in epoxy resin at different ageing times exposed to \n\nMgO-SiO2 cement.

Clinker-free cement, made out of a blend of MgO (60% w.t.) and SiO2 (40% \n\nw.t.) powder was used as hydraulic binder matrix for FRCC. This cement presents higher \n\ncompressive stregth compared to Portland cement for a 0.5 water to binder ratio after 28 days of \n\ncuring under saturated environment conditions. It also has lower pH values from the first hydration \n\nstages (pH=11.09 after mixing in water) and it decreases over time (pH=9.91 after 28 days). Thin \n\nsheets of FRCC with the new cement were bending tested and good mechanical properties were \n\nachieved and well preserved after ageing. Contrary to what happens in samples made out of \n\nPortland cement, with MgO based cement samples, no degradation mechanisms are noticed after \n\nageing. Specific energy does not decreases and bending strength is improved along with time due \n\nto the ongoing hydration of the MgO-SiO2-H20 systems. Also carbonation curing has been proved to \n\nimprove FRCC stability. New Hydrate Magnesium Carbonated phase is obtained, which yields to \n\nmore rigid materials due to the higher volume of hydrates in the matrix. Partial cement replacement \n\nby sepiolite improves flocculation estability of the fibre-cement suspensions, particles retention and \n\nFRCC homogeneity since the variation coeficient of the mechanical parametres and physiclal \n\nproperties is reduced for samples with sepiolite. Sisal fibres were embedded in MgO-based cement \n\nand submitted to longer accelerated ageing curing and no signs of damage were perceived on the \n\nfibres. While sisal fibres in Portland show symthoms of degradation (cracking of the cells, breakage \n\nof the linking cell tissues and CaCaO3 depositions), fibres in MgO-SiO2 cement preserve their \n\nintegrity and both their cellulose content and crystallinity. \n\n5.2 BLOCK 1 \n\nIn systems where MgO and SiO2 are mixed with water, the hydration products obtained are \n\nMg(OH)2 and M-S-H gels for all  the formulations studied regardless of age (7 and 28 days). From TG \n\ntests on samples 100% Mg(OH)2 and M-S-H gels is possible to determine the amount of Mg(OH)2 in \n\nthe blended samples, whereas the mass loss produced between 300 and 550oC in blended samples \n\nis due to the dehydroxylation of Mg(OH)2. So it is noted that for formulations with higher MgO \n\ncontent higher content of Mg(OH)2 is obtained as hydration product. \n\n\n\n141 \n \n\n \n\nEDS results indicate that the M-S-H gels obtained both at 7 and 28 days have a Mg/Si ratio \n\ngain with increasing MgO content. Similarly, for all samples the Mg/Si ratio increases over time, \n\nwhich can be interpreted as a change in the gel structure over time because the reaction is still not \n\ncomplete after 28 days. This can also be detected by SEM studies, where particles of Mg(OH)2 are \n\nsurrounded by areas of high concentration of Si, which is interpreted as a region where there has \n\nbeen a great dissolution of SiO2 to form [Si(OH)4]. This in turn facilitates the dissociation Mg2+ and \n\n(OH)-, promoting the formation of laminar structures of silicates which subsequently form part of \n\nthe structure of the MSH gels. Also FTIR spectra obtained for all samples exhibit a strong \n\nresemblance to the spectra corresponding to the layered hydroxides which are similar to chain and \n\nlaminar silicates, as well as the basic units forming the structures of layered double hydroxide \n\nminerals.  \n\nDespite initially pursuing the maximum content of M-S-H gels in samples in order to achieve \n\nthe maximum mechanical performance, it is observed that this does not necessarily increase \n\nmechanical performance of the samples. Conversely, at 7 days there is a correlation between the \n\ncontent of Mg(OH)2 and the compressive strength of the samples, indicating that the mechanical \n\nproperties are not influenced exclusively by the M-S-H gel content. This is corroborated even at 28 \n\ndays wherein the formulation with highest mechanical strength is not the one with a highest M-S-H \n\ngel content. There seems to be a clear correlation between the amount of pores associated with the \n\nfree presence in the matrix after the hydration reactions, and the compressive strength. \n\nIn view of the results of pH tests, samples with less MgO content have lower values. \n\nAccording to compression tests, the formulations 60% MgO-40% SiO2 and 70% MgO-30% SiO2 have \n\nthe highest values at 28 days, with no statiscal difference. 60% MgO-40% SiO2 is chosen as optimal \n\nfor the development of fibre-cement composites since is the most mechanical resistant and is less \n\nalkaline compared with 70% MgO-30% SiO2. \n\n \n\n5.3 BLOCK 2 \n\nThe use of Magnesia-Silica (MgO-SiO2) cement is presented as an excellent solution to \n\nproduce fibre-cement products reinforcement exclusively with lignocellulosic fibres since this new \n\ntype of binder preserves cellulosic fibres integrity after ageing, so composites made out of MgO-\n\n\n\n142 \n \n\n \n\nSiO2 exhibit significant higher properties after 200 cycles of accelerated ageing than Portland cement \n\ncomposites. According to flexural tests MgO-SiO2 fibre-cement composites: \n\nIncrease or maintain Modulus of Rupture, Limit of Proportionality and Modulus of Elasticity \n\nvalues after 200 cycles of accelerated ageing for both types of reinforcement (pine and eucalyptus \n\nfibres), contrarily to what happens for Portland cement samples that suffer a significant loss on \n\nModulus of Rupture after ageing. \n\nPresent the highest values of Specific Energy and Specific Deflection for both types of \n\nreinforcement at the two tested ages. The preservation of the Specific Energy after 200 aac of the \n\nMgO-SiO2 samples reinforced with eucalyptus pulp is remarkable, while PC samples drastically loss \n\ntheir initial toughness. \n\nOffer better properties when reinforced with eucalyptus fibres rather than samples with \n\npine fibres. This can be associated to the reduced water retention of the eucalyptus pulps during \n\nmolding process, allowing lower water to binder ratio and thus a less porous matrix. Another factor \n\nto explain the best mechanical performance of the samples reinforced with eucalyptus is their \n\nshorter length and width, thus obtaining a higher number of reinforcing elements by mass. Hence, \n\na more homogeneous distribution of the reinforcement is achieved. \n\nIn addition, with the aid of the SEM images, the preservation of the cellulosic fibres is \n\nconfirmed and flexural performance is explained when reinforcing MgO-SiO2 matrices, observing \n\nthat: \n\nNo significant evidences of mineralization are observed, as occurs with PC samples that \n\nsuffer lumen mineralization (eucalyptus fibres) and fibre-matrix interface mineralization (pine \n\nfibres), suggesting that no apparent damage is caused to the fibres. \n\nA better fibre-matrix adherence is produced due to a matrix densification result of an \n\nongoing hydration reaction. This evolution of the hydration reaction also helps to improve the \n\ncomposite rigidity and physical properties since a significant reduction of the water absorption and \n\napparent porosity is achieved after accelerated ageing. \n\nBetter distribution of eucalyptus fibres in comparison to pine fibres, reducing the \n\nunreinforced regions within the matrix and therefore resulting in a better mechanical performance. \n\n\n\n143 \n \n\n \n\nIn view of all the experimental results, the use of MgO-SiO2 is presented as a suitable \n\nalternative to cementitious products reinforced with cellulosic pulps with potential application in \n\ncivil construction in view of acceptable performance under binding solicitations and since no \n\nappreciable degradation of the fibres takes places after 200 soak &amp; dry accelerated ageing cycles.    \n\n \n\n5.4 BLOCK 3 \n\nAccording to XRD results, for uncarbonated samples, Mg(OH)2 and M-S-H gels are present \n\nin the samples before and after ageing, remaining as the main hydration products. However, for \n\ncarbonated samples, Mg(OH)2 peaks are clearly lowered, arising new peaks matching \n\nhydromagnesite[Mg5(CO3)4\u00b7(OH)2\u00b74H2O]. Another particular feature for carbonated samples is the \n\nreduction of the humps corresponding to M-S-H gel, suggesting that this phase is also carbonated. \n\nThese effects of carbonation may be extended even after carbonation curing conditions are present, \n\nwhen samples are submitted to high temperatures (60oC). \n\nFrom TG curves, it is possible to observe the effectiveness of carbonation curing since \n\nsamples submitted to carbonation present a higher mass loss due to the decomposition of \n\ncarbonated products. From DTG curves, two specific peaks centred at around 260 and 520oC are \n\npresent for carbonated samples, matching the dehydroxylation and decarbonation of \n\nhydromagnesite, main product obtained from carbonation curing process. These two peaks remain \n\nfor carbonated samples after accelerated ageing cycles, confirming the thermodynamic stability of \n\nthe carbonated phases over time. Another effect of carbonation is the dislocation of the peaks that \n\nare centred at around 110 and 410oC when non-carbonation curing is applied. Thus, this \n\ndisplacement may be attributed to carbonation of brucite and M-S-H respectively.  \n\nFurthermore, SEM confirms the presence of hydromagnesite crystals when carbonation \n\ncuring is applied as well as different crystalline phases not noticed for uncarbonated samples that \n\ncan be associated to the carbonation of the M-S-H gel in the paste. This process of carbonation may \n\nproduce modify the chemical composition of MgO-SiO2-H2O systems to form compounds with a \n\nsepiloite-like composition. \n\nRegarding flexural performance, excellent strength is achieved, with values over 12 MPa, \n\nconfirming the suitability of both cement and polypropylene fibres to produce apt fibre-cement \n\n\n\n144 \n \n\n \n\nproducts. Besides, extraordinary toughness performance is attained, with specific energy values \n\nover 7.5 kJ/m2.  Carbonation affects positively to mechanical strength and physical properties with \n\nno deleterious effects after ageing since it increases matrix rigidity. These flexural values are higher \n\nthan those reported on the literature where polypropylene fibres are unable to offer a good \n\nreinforcement effect due to its low density that generates a poor distribution within the matrix and \n\nthe possible formation of clamps. An increment in the amount of cellulosic reinforcement would \n\nhelp to resist higher flexural loads without decreasing the toughness of the composites. \n\n \n\n5.5 BLOCK 4 \n\nSepiolite addition increases MOE of hydrated MgO-SiO2 pastes regardless sepiolite type and \n\nreplacement amount. The lower the sepiolite replacement the higher elastic modulus. Since most \n\nof the formulations do not affect the MgO-SiO2-H2O system reactivity, this improvement in MOE is \n\nrelated to a better interlinking between hydrated particles created by sepiolite particles. When \n\nsepiolite addition improves the formation of more M-S-H gel, it is also associated to a higher specific \n\nsurface of this type of sepiolite (PANGEL). This also affect to the water retention of the samples and \n\ntherefore it can be concluded that the presence of more hydrated compounds is a consequence of \n\na higher amount of water within the system. \n\nRegarding flocculation, the addition of sepiolite to MgO-SiO2 systems increases the floc size \n\nof the fibre-cement suspensions in an aqueous liquid compared to PC samples. This improves the \n\nDPM process in terms of fines retention. The higher fines retention would be a very positive effect \n\nin an upscaled production process due to the reduced amount of tiny particles susceptible of being \n\nstack and block industrial machinery.  \n\nThe introduction of sepiolite in suspensions where both cement and fibres are dispersed \n\nhampers water removal in MgO-SiO2 systems compared to PC systems. However the addition of \n\nsepiolite increases drainage speed, this is that most of the water is removed faster than in samples \n\ncontaining PC. Once again, this factor would suppose an advantage in a larger production scale since \n\nit makes more efficient the DPM process with regard to energy saving in the dewatering step. \n\nSamples with higher specific surface sepiolite retain more water than those with lower specific \n\nsurface. This phenomenon is also reported for hydrated pastes. \n\n\n\n145 \n \n\n \n\nSince sepiolite induces a higher water retention with no reactive effect, it decreases flexural \n\nand physical performances of the FRCC. Nevertheless, this increase in retain water may be \n\ncounterbalanced with the interlocking effect of the sepiolite particles that can improve flexural \n\nperformance and physical properties when dosed in reduced amounts (1%). This is very important \n\nsince it allows the combination with carbonation curing techniques since the greater amount of \n\nwater in the samples enhances the carbonation process in Mg-based cements. \n\nThe most interesting effect of adding sepiolite into FRCC with MgO-SiO2 systems is the \n\nincrease of the composite homogeneity. This is specially remarkable in the case of physical \n\nproperties, which is undeniably desired as it makes possible the achievement of a more reliable \n\nmaterial. It would also be important to optimise this type of composites in the future, since the use \n\nof sepiolite would reduce the amount of material to obtain reliable test results. \n\n \n\n5.6 BLOCK 5 \n\nThermal tests reveal that sisal fibres, even after 400 accelerated ageing cycles do not suffer \n\na significant reduction in cellulose content when exposed to MgO-SiO2 cement. The mass loss \n\nreported is in accordance with alkali treatments applied for polymeric composites applications, \n\nwhere amorphous fractions are undesired. In addition, from thermal tests, activation energy and \n\nenthalpy is well preserved for fibres in MgO-SiO2 regardless ageing treatment.  \n\nFrom XRD tests is deduced that cellulose crystallinity and crystallite size is well preserved \n\nand slightly increased due to the removal of amorphous compounds of the fibres. This is in contrast \n\nwith samples embedded in PC, which after 400aac it is noticed a little decrease of crystallinity due \n\nto the chemical degradation of cellulose. Besides, samples in MgO-SiO2 do not present extra peaks \n\nin their respective diffractograms corresponding to compounds migrated from cement hydration. \n\nThis suggests that no mineralization is produced. \n\nAccording to SEM techniques, it is possible to see the integrity of the whole fibre with no \n\ndetachment between microfibres neither after 5 months nor after 400aac when submitted to MgO-\n\nSiO2 environment. In addition to the intact aspect of the cross section of the fibres, it is displayed \n\nafter 400aac that compounds from cement hydration, in spite of no penetrating to the inner parts \n\nof the fibres, are perfectly bonded to the surface thereof. Besides, this cement compounds are both \n\n\n\n146 \n \n\n \n\nMg and Si rich, which suggests that not only Mg(OH)2 is formed in the surrounding of the fibres. This \n\nis an important aspect since it assures the presence of strong phases in the ITZ, which could promote \n\na good adherence between fibre and matrix when sisal fibres are applied in this type of FRCC. \n\n  \n\n\n\n147 \n \n\n \n\n6 POSSIBLE FUTURE WORKS \n\nThis thesis is an introduction of lower-alkalinity Mg-based FRCC with lignocellulosic fibres. \n\nIn view of the efficiency of this type of cement for preserving composites performance over time, it \n\nseems possible to develop a new technology for the production of cementitious materials totally \n\nreinforced with cellulose-based materials. However, this work is an initial contact with several \n\nlimitations. Consequently, a sequence of further research has to be performed in order to evaluate \n\nthe authentic possibilities of this new technique. Several studies are exposed to give a continuity to \n\nthe present study: \n\n? Evaluation of the dimensional stability of the exposed composites with the optimization \n\ntechniques explored in previous chapters implemented separately or combined.  \n\n? Study at longer times and under different ageing conditions of the hydration evolution with \n\ncomplimentary techniques to the methods used in this work. \n\n? Analysis of the Interface Transition Zone to understand properly the phenomena in this \n\nregion of the composites and to assess the adherence between lignocellulosic fibres and \n\nMg-based cement. \n\n? Study of the structure of the M-S-H gels and evaluation of methods to improve flowability \n\nthereof to adopt different moulding procedures. \n\n? Evaluation of different FRCC moulding techniques, assessment of their technical properties \n\nand establishment of possible alternative applications for these building materials. \n\n? Study of the introduction of alternative pozzolans to the system as a source of amorphous \n\nSiO2 to replace the use of silica fume by agricultural ashes. The use of pozzolans has been \n\nsuccessfully applied and standardised in PC applications. Pozzolan use would contribute to \n\nthe settlement of new industries in rural areas. \n\n? Exploring Novacem route to produce MgO-SiO2-H2O systems since this cement would \n\nresult in a great opportunity to reduce the cost of reinforcing elements of the current \n\nconstruction industry. Nowadays, Novacem technology and Intellectual Property belongs to \n\nCalix, an Australian chemical company that is currently heading the vanguard of CO2 intake \n\nin materials. The development of this knowledge would be an opportunity to for new \n\nentrepreneurship.  \n\n?
