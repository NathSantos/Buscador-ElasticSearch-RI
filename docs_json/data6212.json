There is still much to be uncovered relative to its\n\nimpacts on the Southern Hemisphere, even more with respect to the Southern Ocean. The\n\nSouth Atlantic and its Southern Ocean sector response to volcanism are examined using\n\nsimulation results from the Last Millennium Ensemble Experiment of the Community\n\nEarth System Model (CESM-LME), for the period 850-2005. Composite results point to\n\nsignificant changes in sea surface temperature and salinity in the first austral summer\n\nfollowing the eruption. North of 60S, there is ocean cooling, as expected because of the\n\nhigher albedo related to the volcanic forcing. In contrast, near the Antarctic Peninsula\n\nin the Weddell Sea, a local warming of ? 0.8?C is observed (significant at the 90% level).\n\nSalinity shows positive anomaly (? 0.1) at the northern region off Antarctic Peninsula\n\nfrom the first year after the eruption to the fourth subsequent year. Oceanic surface\n\nanomalies weaken after the fifth subsequent year, however it is still present in deeper\n\nlayers (? 500m). At the same time, wind stress changes are evident, results show a\n\npoleward shift (? 2?), strengthening (? 10%) of the prevailing westerlies and the reversal\n\nin direction of the meridional wind stress component in the northern Antarctic Peninsula.\n\nAs consequence, there is intensification of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current southern\n\nextension. Together with the stronger westerlies, the mixing in the northern Antarctic\n\nPeninsula is enhanced, bringing up warmer subsurface waters, therefore explaining the\n\nanomalous surface warming after the eruption. The 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption re-\n\nsponse is also investigated. CESM-LME, observations and reanalysis have shown similar\n\nbehavior, however for the second subsequent year, thus suggesting the occurrence of the\n\nsame mechanism identified after Last Millennium eruptions.\n\nKey-words: Weddell Sea, Mt.

About 90% of the Earth energy imbalance is stored in the global\n\nocean as ocean heat content (OHC) (Levitus et al., 2005, 2012; Trenberth et al., 2014;\n\nCheng et al., 2017). Recent OHC estimation by Cheng et al. (2017) showed that all ocean\n\nbasins experienced significant warming since 1998.\n\nOne of the most important natural (non-anthrophogenic) forcing in the Earth\u2019s climate\n\nsystem is the volcanic one (Robock, 2000; Stenchikov et al., 2009; Stenchikov, 2016).\n\nEarth\u2019s climate is regulated primarily by its energy imbalance, which is the equilibrium\n\nbetween incoming and outgoing radiation, energy redistribution and exchange among the\n\nsystem components (Cole-Dai, 2010), such as atmosphere, ocean, land, cryosphere and\n\nbiosphere. In this sense, volcanic eruptions are important because they cause changes in\n\nthe climate by altering Earth\u2019s energy steady state, due to changes in the energy budget,\n\nsuch as modifications on the planetary albedo1 (Cole-Dai, 2010).\n\nQuantifying how much of the climate system is impacted by natural forcing is a key\n\naspect for understanding the Earth\u2019s climate, in order to evaluate the relative impacts\n\nof human pollution and land surface modification (Gao et al., 2008) and to anticipate\n\nfuture climate projections (Mignot et al., 2011; Stevenson et al., 2016). Furthermore,\n\nevaluation of climate model outputs that include volcanic forcing helps to improve Earth\n\nSystem Climate Models that are needed to study anthropogenic effects (Robock, 2000).\n1The fraction of incident solar radiation that is reflected back to space (Talley et al., 2011)\n\n\n\nChapter 1. INTRODUCTION 2\n\n1.1 Volcanism and Climate Variability\n\nVolcanic eruptions are important elements of natural climate variability and climate\n\nchange in different scales (Robock, 2000; Stenchikov et al., 2009; Cole-Dai, 2010) as seen\n\nin Figure 1.1 in a schematic overview. Typically the atmosphere is composed by a mix of\n\npermanent gases that are nitrogen and oxygen, in greater volume, and minor constituents\n\nas carbon dioxide, water vapour and ozone which play a crucial role (Andrews, 2010).\n\nLarge volcanic eruptions inject various gases and particles into the atmosphere, which\n\nmodifies its composition (Timmreck, 2012). Volcanic ash is injected in the atmosphere\n\nand because of its great size and density it drops out in a couple of weeks (Robock,\n\n2000; Timmreck, 2012; Langmann, 2014). Thus, acting only in short-term and regional\n\nto continental scale changes in the Earth\u2019s radiative imbalance and mainly in weather\n\ncharacteristics (Stenchikov, 2016). For detailed role of volcanic ash on the climate the\n\nreader is referred to Langmann (2014).\n\nFigure 1.1: Schematic overview of the climate effects after a large eruption |\nImpact is exemplified on stratosphere, troposphere, ocean, marine biogeochemistry and\nvegetation (fromTimmreck, 2012).\n\nIn addition, there is emission of two important GHG - water vapor and carbon dioxide,\n\nwhich are negligible in comparison to their atmospheric concentration (Robock, 2000).\n\n\n\n3 1.1. Volcanism and Climate Variability\n\nEffects on atmospheric carbon concentration due to volcanism are small, as well as its\n\nfeedbacks (Meronen et al., 2012). According to Gerlach (2011) the anthropogenic CO2\n\nemission dominate over all kind of volcanic emissions (e.g., degassing, submarine volcanoes\n\nand explosions), authors even suggest that the present day annual anthropogenic emissions\n\nmay exceed the output of at least one super eruption. The same occurs for N2 emissions\n\n(Stenchikov, 2016). In addition, there is an input of halogen compounds, such as HCl\n\nand Br substances, which could react with the ozone layer increasing ozone depletion\n\n(Timmreck, 2012; Stenchikov, 2016).\n\nIn global scale climate effect, emission of sulfur-containing gases is the most relevant.\n\nStrong enough eruptions are capable of insert gases such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and\n\nhydrogen sulfide (H2S) into the stratosphere (Robock, 2000; Cole-Dai, 2010; Timmreck,\n\n2012). As depicted in Figure 1.1, these gases are oxidized, reacting with OH and H2O, to\n\nsulfuric acid vapor (H2SO4?) on timescale of weeks (Robock, 2000). Then, it is converted\n\nto sulfate aerosols that produce the dominant radiative effect from volcanism, which is the\n\nfocus of the present study (Timmreck, 2012). After injected into the stratosphere sulfate\n\naerosols are able to be advected around the globe very rapidly, driven by atmospheric\n\ncirculation (Robock, 2000).\n\nThe sulfate aerosol cloud has an e-folding decay time of ?1 year, during this period\n\nit impacts on both short-wave and long-wave radiation (Robock, 2000). According to\n\nStenchikov (2016), the total forcing related to volcanic eruptions results from a compen-\n\nsation mechanism between the long-wave and short-wave radiation. At the same time\n\nthat there is an increase in short-wave reflection (between 3 to 5 W m?2), there is aerosol\n\nabsorption of long-wave radiation, so the total cooling of the system is between 2 to 3\n\nW m?2. As exemplified in Figure 1.2 of volcanic aerosol total, short-wave and long-wave\n\nradiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere during some of the great modern eruptions,\n\nsuch as Agung (1963), El Chich\u00f3n (1982) and Mt. Pinatubo (1991).\n\n\n\nChapter 1. INTRODUCTION 4\n\nFigure 1.2: Volcanic radiative forcing | Total volcanic aerosol (green line), short-wave\n(red line) and long-wave (blue line) radiative forcing [W m?2] at the top of the atmosphere\nfrom 1950 to 2000 (from Stenchikov, 2016).\n\nThe information about magnitude and approximate location of past eruptions is\n\nobtained from paleovolcanic ice-core records, mainly sulfate aerosol deposits in Arctic and\n\nAntarctica (Cole-Dai, 2010; Timmreck, 2012; Stevenson et al., 2016). This information\n\nhelps create reconstructions of eruption strength such as Gao et al. (2008) and Crowley\n\net al. (2008). However, Sigl et al. (2014) points out that reconstructions may overestimate\n\nor underestimate volcanic aerosol before 1500, which leads to simulations of stronger\n\ncooling from what is found in temperature reconstructions. Also, there are other ways to\n\nhave evidence of past volcanic eruptions climate responses, for example from tree-rings\n\nand other proxy archives (Sigl et al., 2015; Stevenson et al., 2016). Different from ice-core\n\nrecords, the tree-rings measurements are an indirect way of obtaining volcanism evidence,\n\nsince what is imprinted in the tree-rings is the temperature change and not the direct\n\namount of sulfate aerosol in the atmosphere (Cole-Dai, 2010).\n\nA common index used to compare the eruption magnitude is the Volcanic Explosivity\n\nIndex (VEI), which is used as a measurement of the climatological impact of volcanoes\n\n(Robock, 2000). The greatest volcanic eruptions in history have a VEI of 8, but the scale\n\nis open-ended (Newhall and Self, 1982).\n\nBecause of the sulfate aerosols ability to spread in both hemispheres, tropical eruptions\n\n\n\n5 1.1. Volcanism and Climate Variability\n\nare the most important relative to global climate (Schneider et al., 2009). High latitude\n\nvolcanoes primarily affect the hemisphere in which they are located (Timmreck, 2012;\n\nMeronen et al., 2012). The season of eruption is also an important factor, since the\n\ndistribution of the sulfate aerosol cloud is mainly controlled by large-scale circulation of\n\nthe atmosphere (Timmreck, 2012). As described in Meronen et al. (2012) winter eruptions\n\ncause smaller climate effects than summer and early autumn eruptions. Stevenson et al.\n\n(2017) suggest that the eruption season could help explain the differences between proxy\n\ndata and models.\n\nThe effect of volcanism on the atmosphere can last for about five to seven years and\n\neven more in the oceans (Stenchikov, 2016). Examples of the impact of volcanism on the\n\natmosphere and ocean are shown in Sections 1.1.1 and 1.1.2, respectively.\n\n1.1.1 Volcanism impact on the atmosphere\n\nThe sulfate aerosol acts like a shield from incoming solar radiation on the top of the\n\ntroposphere. By scattering short-waves atmosphere albedo is increased (Cole-Dai, 2010),\n\nthereby causing primarily surface cooling (Robock, 2000; Timmreck, 2012; Stenchikov,\n\n2016). Aerosols also absorb long-wave and near-infrared radiation (Stenchikov, 2016),\n\nproducing strong stratospheric warming (Figure 1.1). In the lower latitudes Robock and\n\nMao (1992) observed cooling due to reduced solar flux, the maximum surface atmospheric\n\ntemperature anomaly is of -0.172K during July (Meronen et al., 2012). At the same time,\n\nthere is winter warming over northern hemisphere continents, which is connected with\n\nchanges in the atmosphere dynamics processes (Robock and Mao, 1992; Robock, 2000;\n\nRobock et al., 2007; Graf et al., 2007). Surface atmosphere temperature changes over\n\nthe oceans are smaller than over the continents, related with the larger heat capacity of\n\nwater (Meronen et al., 2012).\n\nWhile the northern hemisphere atmospheric variability related to volcanic activity is\n\nwell known, eruptions consequences on the southern hemisphere still in debate (Timmreck,\n\n2012). For example, studies diverge about the effect for the Southern Annular Mode\n\n\n\nChapter 1. INTRODUCTION 6\n\n(SAM)2 (e.g., Roscoe and Haigh, 2007; Robock et al., 2007; McGraw et al., 2016). Results\n\nfrom Roscoe and Haigh (2007) showed a negative correlation between volcanic aerosol\n\nand SAM. Schneider et al. (2009) observed the westerlies shift equatorward in a high-\n\nlatitude eruption scenario in the CCSM3. Results from Karpechko et al. (2010) also\n\nshowed westerlies intensification after eruptions, which is in agreement with positive\n\nSAM. On the other hand, Robock et al. (2007) does not observe any significant change in\n\nthe SAM intensity. Using Large Ensemble experiment from CESM and Coupled Model\n\nIntercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), McGraw et al. (2016) also show results that\n\nthe southern hemisphere response to eruptions is a robust positive SAM, however with\n\nlarge internal variability3. The authors discuss that El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)\n\ninfluences the SAM response to volcanism, in which the SAM anomaly is larger during\n\nnegative ENSO conditions.\n\nThere is a relation between volcanic eruptions and ENSO events (Lehner et al., 2016;\n\nPausata et al., 2016). Timmreck (2012) with climate models and Li et al. (2013) with\n\nproxy evidence proposed that volcanism could force the climate system a favorable state to\n\nENSO occurrence in the year after an eruption. As well, Pausata et al. (2015) showed with\n\nclimate model that high-latitude eruptions in the northern hemisphere could induce ENSO\n\noccurrence in the 8-9 months. Stevenson et al. (2016) also observed using an ensemble\n\napproach that northern eruptions tends toward El Ni\u00f1o, while southern eruptions tends\n\ntoward La Ni\u00f1a. Maher et al. (2015) observed with 610 ensemble set from CMIP5, the\n\nsame increased likelihood of an El Ni\u00f1o-like response after an eruption and also suggest\n\nthat there is an increased chance of La Ni\u00f1a occurrence in the third austral summer\n\n(defined as the December, January and February average, DJF) after the eruption.\n\nAlso the hydrological cycle is globally affected by great volcanic activity (Barnes\n\net al., 2016; Fasullo et al., 2017). Significant reduction in global mean precipitation\n\nfollowing volcanic eruptions is shown in Trenberth and Dai (2007), Schneider et al. (2009)\n\nand Meronen et al. (2012). However, the response is not always linear because of cloud\n2The primary mode of extratropical variability in the southern hemisphere.\n3The variability related to each of the ensemble members, normally measured as a standard deviation\n\nfrom the average of selected members of the ensemble, or the ensemble average\n\n\n\n7 1.1. Volcanism and Climate Variability\n\nmicrophysics, great variability and different atmosphere time scales (Timmreck, 2012). In\n\naddition, Joseph and Zeng (2011) found evidence that the precipitation response over the\n\nland is faster than over the oceans, related to their difference heat capacities. Stevenson\n\net al. (2016) discuss that volcanic eruptions influence the monsoon system as well.\n\n1.1.2 Volcanism impact on the ocean\n\nOcean properties and its dynamics are affected by volcanic eruptions as well, however\n\nits response could reach even longer time scales than the atmospheric disturbance.\n\nOcean temperature\n\nAs with the atmosphere temperature, surface ocean cools after volcanic events (e.g.,\n\nChurch et al., 2005; Ding et al., 2014; McGregor et al., 2015; Stenchikov, 2016). According\n\nto Church et al. (2005) the automatic reduction in the net solar flux after an eruption\n\nis the first trigger for SST changes. Evan et al. (2009) show that about 67% of the low\n\nfrequency SST variability is driven by aerosol effects on the incoming radiation, in which\n\n55% is from volcanic activity for the period of 1082-2007.\n\nResults from Church et al. (2005) discuss a decrease in the SST of -0.4?C in the\n\nmodel output and -0.3?C in observations. Evan et al. (2009) studying the Tropical North\n\nAtlantic Ocean with models observe a cooling that ranges from -0.1 to -2?C. During the\n\nperiod 850-1850 (LM), Mignot et al. (2011) observe an abrupt surface ocean cooling of\n\n1?C. Stenchikov (2016) show a negative anomaly in the SST of 0.4-1K. For eruptions\n\nbetween 1871 and 2005, Ding et al. (2014) observe a globally averaged post eruption\n\ncooling of 0.1 to 0.3?C. In the same period, results using ORAs4 reanalysis show global\n\ncooling episodes related to El Chich\u00f3n (1982) eruption (Balmaseda et al., 2013). In\n\naddition, there is evidence of cooling in the polar North Atlantic SST in proxy data and\n\nmodel simulations detected in Sicre et al. (2011). Authors observe decadal cooling of 1\n\nto 2?C, which agree with episodes of volcanic eruption during the LM.\n\nUsing CMIP5 results Ding et al. (2014) observe that the SST cold anomaly due to\n\n\n\nChapter 1. INTRODUCTION 8\n\nvolcanic eruptions is the lowest 1-2 years following eruptions. This fact is consistent\n\nwith Pausata et al. (2015) model experiments that show a cooling that develops in the\n\n1-3 years after the eruption in the Pacific Ocean. Moreover, volcanic activity could be\n\nresponsible for the beginning of the anomalous cold period known as Little Ice Age (LIA),\n\nbetween 1400-1700 (Crowley et al., 2008; Sicre et al., 2011). This agrees with Miller et al.\n\n(2012), where they discuss that the repeated explosive volcanism at the time would be\n\nable to create a anomalous cooling, which could be maintained by sea-ice-ocean feedback.\n\nThe cooling due to volcanic explosions could even impact the recent ocean warming.\n\nResults from 7 ensemble simulations between 1861-2000 show that the atmosphere aerosol\n\ninput from volcanic eruptions is able to reduce in ? 2/3 the magnitude of the recent ocean\n\nwarming due to GHG (Delworth et al., 2005). This agrees with Gleckler et al. (2006)\n\nthat shows the importance of models that included volcanic forcing in understanding and\n\ncorrectly estimating global climate. The author discuss the dramatic effect on simulated\n\nchanges in OHC and sea level over the 20?? century.\n\nChurch et al. (2005) observe 3\u00d71022J decrease in OHC, while Stenchikov (2016)\n\nobserve a maximum of 5\u00d71022J. Church et al. (2005) point that the maximum cooling\n\noccurs between 50S and 60N, during the first and second summers for both hemispheres.\n\nProbably due to shallow mixed layers at this time of year, which responds more rapidly\n\nto heat flux changes (Church et al., 2005).Delworth et al. (2005) suggests that the\n\nsubsurface recovery time scales is greater than surface anomalies, because of the absence\n\nof air-sea fluxes. Stenchikov (2016) discuss that the time necessary to ocean recover to its\n\nunperturbed state could reach centennial scales. This agrees with Pausata et al. (2015)\n\nresults in SST on Nino3.4 region. However, Church et al. (2005) results show smaller\n\nrecovery time scales. Authors suggest that on the thermocline the signal from volcanism\n\nwould remain for decades, fact that also agrees with Ding et al. (2014).\n\nStenchikov et al. (2009) propose that if the surface anomalous temperature could last\n\nat least a decade, the portion of this anomaly that is transmitted to the OHC, would last\n\nup to 50 years. On the other side, Gregory (2010) discuss that the OHC drop after an\n\neruption and the long-term recovery time may not be real, but a result from an artifact\n\n\n\n9 1.1. Volcanism and Climate Variability\n\nof experimental design related to Ocean General Circulation Models spin up scheme.\n\nThe size of the eruption is an important consideration when analyzing its consequences\n\n(Gleckler et al., 2006; Sigl et al., 2015; Stenchikov, 2016). In addition, the background\n\ncondition, meaning the ocean condition before the volcanic event, is also important in\n\nevaluating the climate response, as shown in Zanchettin et al. (2013).\n\nDue to changes in the OHC, consequently there are alterations in the mean sea level\n\nthrough steric height (Gregory et al., 2006; Stenchikov, 2016). Simulations indicate a\n\ndrop of 6 to 25mm in the mean sea level after a volcanic event, that takes a decade to\n\nrecover (Church et al., 2005; Cazenave, 2005; Fasullo and Nerem, 2016). In addition,\n\nvolcanic induced perturbations propagate into the ocean deeper layers. Stenchikov (2016)\n\nidentified a cooling in the deep Southern Ocean. The signal in the deep ocean, between\n\n0-1000m, may persist for several decades (Ding et al., 2014).\n\nSea-Ice\n\nA complex consequence of volcanic eruptions is the sea-ice feedback. Based on a series\n\nof CMIP5 ensembles Ding et al. (2014) observe sea ice extent and mass increase by about\n\n5%. Stenchikov et al. (2009) observe in the Arctic maximum sea ice extent anomaly\n\nof 0.6 to 0.8 \u00d7 106km2. Even though sea-ice modifications being hard to estimate in\n\nobservations and models, Stenchikov (2016) point that the sea-ice extension responds\n\nmore to ocean temperature and circulation, than to the direct change of the radiative\n\nforcing. Fact that agrees with Zhong et al. (2011) that discuss the high sensitivity of the\n\nsea-ice response. Zanchettin et al. (2014), using climate simulation ensembles, point to\n\nArctic and Antarctic asymmetry after an eruption. Authors have divided the response\n\nin two phases, firstly the sea-ice in both poles expand followed by contraction only in\n\nAntarctica sea-ice.\n\n\n\nChapter 1. INTRODUCTION 10\n\n1.1.3 Modern eruption: Mt. Pinatubo\n\nThe Mt. Pinatubo is the best observed eruption so far (Timmreck, 2012), being the\n\nlargest volcanic explosion from the 20?? century (Robock, 2002) and since of the beginning\n\nof the satellite era (Barnes et al., 2016). It erupted in June 1991 in the Philippines, Luzon\n\nIsland at 15.1N and 120.4E shown in Figure 1.3. Its explosion liberated 20 Tg of SO2\n\ninto the stratosphere (Robock and Mao, 1992) and a estimated release of 0.05 Gigatons\n\nof CO2 in the atmosphere (Gerlach, 2011).\n\nFigure 1.3: Mt. Pinatubo | (a) 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption (https://www.wired.\ncom/2016/). (b) Geographical location of Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines.\n\nMt. Pinatubo eruption has been widely studied (e.g., Hansen et al., 1992; Stenchikov\n\net al., 1998; Robock et al., 2007; Otter\u00e5, 2008; Bender et al., 2010; Meehl et al., 2015;\n\nBarnes et al., 2016; Predybaylo et al., 2017). The amount of aerosol injection is equivalent\n\nto a radiative cooling of 0.2 ? 0.3?C (Gao et al., 2008). As major effect in the northern\n\nhemisphere documented in Robock (2002) the surface atmosphere was cooled by about\n\n2?C during the boreal summer of the next year and in the boreal winter of 1992-1993 it\n\nwas warmer by 3?C.\n\nAnother fact pointed in Robock (2002) is the possibility of delayed global warming in\n\nseveral years because of the cooling effect related to Mt. Pinatubo explosion. Further,\n\naerosol from volcanic eruptions are described as one possible driver of hiatus periods\n\nduring warming scenario (Maher et al., 2014; Santer et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2016). At\n\nthe same time, Maher et al. (2014) also discuss the importance of the background condition\n\nin the eruption, because even Mt. Pinatubo being one of the largest eruptions since 1860,\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/2016/\nhttps://www.wired.com/2016/\n\n\n11 1.1. Volcanism and Climate Variability\n\nit was not enough to increase the likelihood of hiatus period, as observed in the Krakatoa\n\neruption in 1883. Also, due to non-stationary background of large anthropogenically\n\nforced changes in ocean heat content, the anomalies induced by Mt. Pinatubo eruption\n\nare much smaller than Krakatoa (1883) temperature anomalies (Gleckler et al., 2006).\n\nA Mt. Pinatubo sized eruption simulation creates a -0.4K SST anomaly, a decrease in\n\nthe mean sea level of 9mm, a decrease in the OHC of 5\u00d7 1022J and Atlantic Meridional\n\nOverturning Circulation (AMOC)4 strengthening of ?1.8 Sv (Stenchikov et al., 2009;\n\nStenchikov, 2016). The same surface cooling after Mt. Pinatubo eruption is observed\n\nin simulations by Church et al. (2005), however observations have shown smaller cooling\n\nof 0.3?C and a decrease in OHC of 3\u00d7 1022J. At the same time, in CMIP5 results Ding\n\net al. (2014) find negative SST anomaly of only 0.1?C. Also documented as consequences\n\nof the Mt. Pinatubo eruption are the decrease in stratospheric ozone, increase in the\n\nstratospheric temperature (Timmreck, 2012 and references therein) and changes in the\n\nhydrological cycle (Trenberth and Dai, 2007) .\n\nIt should be noted that Mt. Pinatubo eruption followed other two eruptions Agung\n\nin 1963 and El Chich\u00f3n in 1982. Bender et al. (2010) discuss that Mt. Pinatubo eruption\n\nmay have overlapping of anomalies due to eruptions proximity, even though that the\n\nradiative perturbation has already decayed. In the same year of Mt. Pinatubo explosion\n\nan ENSO event was observed, Robock et al. (2007) suggests that the 1991-1992 El Ni\u00f1o\n\nevent could even suppress the volcanic signal in the observational data. Bender et al.\n\n(2010) discuss that this could help explain differences between observational and model\n\nsimulations in the volcanic signals. Although Mt. Pinatubo has been the great eruption\n\nof the 20?? century, during August 1991, Cerro Hudson (Chile) erupted as well (Cole-Dai\n\net al., 1999). This eruption was smaller than the Mt. Pinatubo, however its location is\n\nin the southern hemisphere (Cole-Dai et al., 1997). Therefore, there may be influence\n\nof this eruption on the South Atlantic Ocean, however this volcano is not present in the\n\nreconstruction (Gao et al., 2008) that forced CESM-LME (Otto-Bliesner et al., 2016).\n4Atlantic limb of the global Meridional Overturning Circulation that includes thermohaline induced\n\nfluxes as well as wind-driven circulation (Talley, 2013).\n\n\n\nChapter 1. INTRODUCTION 12\n\n1.2 The South Atlantic Ocean\n\nHere the main characteristics of the South Atlantic region including its Southern\n\nOcean sector are described, which is the focus of this work.\n\nSurface Winds\n\nOver the South Atlantic the wind circulation is mainly composed by a strong westerly\n\nwind belt, on average between 40S and 60S (Talley et al., 2011). Westerlies are stronger\n\nduring the austral winter, however the variability is smaller than the subtropical zone\n\nwind in the northern hemisphere (Tomczak and Godfrey, 2001). Further south, around\n\nAntarctica the wind regime is dominated by the polar easterlies, which are the most\n\nintense in the Atlantic Ocean (Tomczak and Godfrey, 2001). Over the Weddell Sea, the\n\nwind circulation is controlled by a low pressure center (Deacon, 1979). The representation\n\nof surface wind circulation for the LM is shown on Figure 3.2. For further details about\n\nthe wind circulation in the South Atlantic Ocean the reader is referred to Cavalcanti et al.\n\n(2009).\n\nWind-driven Circulation\n\nThe dominant wind regime is responsible for the surface circulation in the South\n\nAtlantic Ocean and its southern sector, represented in Figure 1.4. The northern limit of\n\nthe study region is 30S and extends to the Antarctic coastline. The Atlantic sector is\n\nconsidered from 70W to 30E. It includes part of the southern hemisphere anticyclonic\n\nsubtropical gyre in the South Atlantic Ocean, the Antarctic Circumpolar Curent (ACC),\n\nas well the subpolar gyre in the Weddell Sea.\n\nThe South Atlantic anticyclonic subtropical gyre is composed by the South Equatorial\n\nCurrent (SEC) as its northern extension (Tomczak and Godfrey, 2001), a broad westward\n\nflow that splits at the western boundary into the Brazil Current (BC) and North Brazil\n\nCurrent (NBC). The Brazil Current is the western boundary current, that flows southward\n\nto the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence, around 36-38S; where it meets the Malvinas Current\n\n\n\n13 1.2. The South Atlantic Ocean\n\n(MC), the north-eastward extension of the ACC into the Atlantic (Talley et al., 2011).\n\nThe South Atlantic Current (SAC) closes the gyre in its southern extension, it flows\n\neastward to the Benguela Current (BeC) and recirculates within the subtropical gyre.\n\nFigure 1.4: Wind-driven surface schematics for the South Atlantic Ocean and\nits southern sector | The CESM-LME mean climatological (850-2005) wind stress curl\n[N m?3] is shown in background colors. Black arrows represent the main circulation based\non Talley et al. (2011) and Pontes et al. (2016). The abbreviations are used for ACC:\nAntarctic Circumpolar Current, WG: Weddell Gyre, ACoC: Antarctic Coastal Current,\nSAC: South Atlantic Current, BC: Brazil Current, MC: Malvinas Current, NBC: North\nBrazil Current, SEC: South Equatorial Current and BeC: Benguela Current.\n\nThe Southern Ocean region is dominated by the eastward flow of the ACC, its north\n\nboundary is the Subtropical Front. The ACC is mostly driven by the wind circulation;\n\nhowever it is not a broad eastward flow, but a composition of three main jets associated\n\n\n\nChapter 1. INTRODUCTION 14\n\nwith oceanic fronts (Talley et al., 2011), which are from north to south, the Subantarctic\n\nFront, Polar Front and the South Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. The main\n\nACC characteristic is its circumpolar circulation, which makes it an important and only\n\nconnection between the other oceans in the globe. The Antarctic Divergence is located at\n\nthe ACC southern boundary, it exists because of the wind circulation transition between\n\nthe westerlies to easterlies (Carter et al., 2008). This region is related to upwelling of\n\nintermediate and deep waters (e.g., North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW)).\n\nSouth of the ACC is the Weddell subpolar gyre, which is separated from the ACC flow\n\nby the Weddell Gyre Front, around 60S (Heywood et al., 2004). The Weddell Gyre extends\n\nfrom approximately 60W to 20E (Cavalieri and Parkinson, 2008). Near the continent the\n\nWeddell Gyre is formed partially by the Antarctic Coastal Current (ACoC)(Talley et al.,\n\n2011). According to N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Riboni and Fahrbach (2009), this current flows westward\n\nover the shelf acting as a dynamic barrier to the Warm Deep Water (WDW) and it is\n\nassociated with shelf break fronts, as the Antarctic Shelf Front (Talley et al., 2011). For\n\nmore details about the Weddell Sea, the reader is referred to Hellmer et al. (2016).\n\nWater Masses\n\nMost of the ocean floor, about 58% (Johnson, 2008), is covered by the Antarctic\n\nBottom Water (AABW), which is part of the deep branch of the AMOC. Its production\n\nis dependent on many complex ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere interaction processes in the\n\nSouthern Ocean (e.g., Kerr et al., 2017), one of the most important is the shelf break\n\nconvection5.\n\nThe AABW formation depends on different source water types, which originates local\n\ntypes of bottom water that later are exported to the global circulation. Jullion et al.\n\n(2014) discuss that the role of the Weddell Sea in producing and exporting AABW is\n\nyet not completely understood and stems in part from the inflow from the Indian sector.\n\nMeredith (2013) points that the Weddell Sea is one of the most important site for the\n5Mixture of surface waters, near the freezing point, with intermediate waters, which are warmer and\n\nsaltier; therefore, sinking by convection near the Antarctic shelf break (Nicholls et al., 2009 and references\ntherein).\n\n\n\n15 1.2. The South Atlantic Ocean\n\nAABW formation, contributing roughly 40%. Therefore, the local water masses from the\n\nWeddell Sea play a role on the AABW formation, such as the WDW, which is a local\n\nvariety of the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) entering the Weddell Gyre at its eastern\n\nboundary. It is characterized by temperature and salinity within the ranges 0&lt;?&lt;1?C\n\nand 34.60&lt;S&lt;34.75 and flows in the Weddell Gyre deep layer (Ryan et al., 2016). The\n\nCDW is the most important water present in the ACC circulation, from 200 to almost\n\n4000m depth (Tomczak and Godfrey, 2001). Normally, it is divided in two types: Upper\n\nCDW, that is low in oxygen and high in nutrients, and the high salinity Lower CDW\n\n(e.g., Kerr, 2010).\n\nAt the surface there is the Antarctic Surface Water (AASW), that responds to ice-melt\n\nand freezing related to seasonality (Talley et al., 2011), from the surface to about 200m\n\ndepth. In the Weddell Sea region there is also the Continental Shelf Water, divided in\n\ndifferent waters present in the shelf region (e.g., Winter Water, High Salinity Shelf Water\n\nand the Ice Shelf Water).\n\nFinally, in the intermediate to deep layers of the oceanic region there is a north-\n\nward flow of the Subantarctic Modal Water (SAMW) and Antarctic Intermediate Wa-\n\nter (AAIW) (Talley et al., 2011). The SAMW is identified by its low oxygen index, placed\n\nbelow the Subantarctic Surface Water, that is a thick mixed layer formed during winter\n\n(Talley et al., 2011). Also located north of the Subantarctic Front, AAIW is characterized\n\nby a low salinity layer present from 500 to 1500m depth (Talley et al., 2011).\n\n\n\nChapter 1. INTRODUCTION 16\n\n1.3 Motivation and Scientific Hypothesis\n\nVolcanism is widely known to have an important role in climate change and in control-\n\nling the Earth energy imbalance (Stenchikov et al., 2009; Cole-Dai, 2010). Understanding\n\nhow different components of the climate system respond to natural forcings is a key\n\naspect to access how the whole Earth system would respond to future climate change.\n\nOne important component of the Earth system is the Southern Ocean, in which there is\n\na lack of knowledge about the impact of the volcanic forcing.\n\nThe impact of great volcanic eruptions in the southern hemisphere is not well known\n\nyet, even more in the South Atlantic and its Southern Ocean sector. Investigation of the\n\natmospheric and ocean response to volcanism has been addressed in modeling studies,\n\nparticularly for the large LM eruptions as well as for the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption,\n\nbut not for this region. The LM is one of the periods with more proxy data records\n\n(Otto-Bliesner et al., 2016), which make it possible to evaluate results from coupled\n\nclimate system models that give a complete and longer perspective on climate variability\n\n(Schneider et al., 2009). Moreover, quantification of volcanic induced changes in the\n\noceans from LM super eruptions (i.e., Mt. Samalas eruption during 1258 in Indonesia)\n\nmight help to better understand the current climate trends (Stenchikov et al., 2009). As\n\na comparison to the LM eruptions 1991 Mt. Pinatubo event is analyzed, because it is a\n\nrecent and significant eruption proven to have global impact (Bender et al., 2010), for\n\nwhich observations and reanalysis products are available.\n\nTherefore, the hypothesis of this study is that great volcanic eruptions will have\n\nan impact on the South Atlantic and its Southern Ocean sector circulation during the\n\nLM. Thus, if there is a signal from great volcanic eruptions detected in the coupled-\n\nclimate model numerical simulations, would it be possible to identify the same signal\n\nfrom observations considering the much smaller eruption of 1991 Mt. Pinatubo?\n\n\n\n17 1.4. Objectives\n\n1.4 Objectives\n\nInvestigate the impact of Last Millennium volcanic events on the South Atlantic and\n\nits Southern Ocean sector.\n\nSpecific objectives to verify the hypothesis outlined above:\n\ni Quantify changes due to volcanic eruptions in air-sea properties on the South Atlantic\n\nand its Southern Ocean sector through the Last Millennium using results from the\n\nLast Millennium Ensemble experiment from the Community Earth System Model\n\ndeveloped at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (CESM-LME/NCAR).\n\nii Investigate if the observed impact of Last Millennium eruptions on the South Atlantic\n\nOcean is also detected from observations related to the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption.\n\n\n\n2 MATERIAL AND METHODS\n\n2.1 Data\n\nVolcanically induced changes in the South Atlantic and its southern sector are exam-\n\nined using simulation results from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)\n\nLast Millennium Ensemble Experiment (LME) of the Community Earth System Model\n\n(CESM), hereafter referred to as CESM-LME (Otto-Bliesner et al., 2016). The simula-\n\ntion results are subdivided in two periods for this study: (i) 850-1850, the same period\n\nused in Mignot et al. (2011) and Stevenson et al. (2016), with focus on the natural\n\nexternal forcings. Then, (ii) 1980-2005, in contrast with the first subperiod, contains\n\nthe anthropogenic imprint. Detection and attribution of climate change in this kind of\n\nstudy is possible, because the CESM-LME long runs without any anthropogenic influence\n\n(Otto-Bliesner et al., 2016).\n\nFor the results validation the Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature Ver-\n\nsion 5 (ERSSTv5) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),\n\ndetails described in Huang et al. (2017), and the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA)\n\nreanalysis version 3.4.1 (Carton and Giese, 2008) are used as auxiliary data. The auxiliary\n\ndata is used in comparison with the CESM-LME post industrial period, specifically with\n\nthe modern eruption of Mt. Pinatubo from June 1991. More details concerning each\n\ndata set mentioned above and the analysis used are provided in the following sections.\n\n2.1.1 Community Earth System Model - Last Millennium\n\nEnsemble\n\nThe LME simulations use the CESM version 1.1 with the Community Atmosphere\n\nModel version 5 (CAM5), see Hurrell et al. (2013) and Kay et al. (2015). The spatial\n\n\n\n19 2.1. Data\n\nresolution of the atmosphere and land components is ?2?. The ocean and sea-ice com-\n\nponents use ?1? spatial resolution and 60 layers as ocean vertical resolution, from the\n\nsurface (15m) to 145m the vertical resolution is 10m. The vertical resolution starts to\n\nincrease in greater depths, from approximately 880m the vertical resolution is of 100m,\n\nincreasing to a maximum of 244m in greater depths around 3000m.\n\nThe model has been spun up from an 1850 control simulation of 650 year and for an\n\n850 control simulation as well, therefore all simulations were started from year 850 of\n\nthe control simulation (Otto-Bliesner et al., 2016). CESM-LME is composed by 10 full\n\nforcing runs, in which all forcings evolve from 850 to 2005. Also, 6 ensembles of single\n\nforcing runs considering the evolution of each forcing individually with all other fixed at\n\nvalues from the year 850 (Otto-Bliesner et al., 2016). The single forcing members are 4\n\nsolar only, 5 volcanic only, 3 land use only, 3 GHG only, 3 orbital only and 2 ozone-aerosol\n\nonly (Figure 2.1). The forcings and implementation are the same as used in Landrum\n\net al. (2013).\n\nFigure 2.1: Runs from CESM-LME | Lengths of the control (black lines) and forced\nruns from the CESM-LME, which are 10 full forcings, 5 volcanic onty, 4 solar only, 3\nGHG, 3 land use only, 3 orbital only and 2 ozone-aerosol only (from Otto-Bliesner et al.,\n2016).\n\nAs described in Otto-Bliesner et al. (2016), the only difference between ensemble\n\nmembers is a small perturbation of order 10?4 ?C in the air temperature initial condi-\n\ntions. The ensemble approach allows improved estimate of the uncertainty from internal\n\nvariability and modeling process (Randall et al., 2007).\n\n\n\nChapter 2. MATERIAL AND METHODS 20\n\nThe forcings considered for the period from 850 to 1850 were GHG (e.g., CO2, CH4\n\nand N2O) based on Schmidt et al. (2011); orbital changes from Berger (1978); changes\n\nin the total solar irradiance prescribed using Vieira et al. (2011); land use derived from\n\na merge between Pongratz et al. (2008) and Hurtt et al. (2011); finally, the volcanic\n\neruptions from the reconstruction version 1 from Gao et al. (2008). What changed for\n\nthe period from 1850 to 2005 was the inclusion of ozone and aerosol forcings (e.g., GHG)\n\nevolving through time (Otto-Bliesner et al., 2016).\n\nThe volcanic eruptions are one of the most important forcings from the LM (Colose\n\net al., 2016), thus it is the focus of the present study. For the volcanic eruptions recon-\n\nstruction Gao et al. (2008) use a total of 53 ice cores, 32 from the Arctic and 22 from\n\nAntarctica, composing a comprehensive stratospheric volcanic sulfate mass loading for the\n\npast 1500 years. This can be converted to optical perturbation index and/or to radiative\n\nforcing series. Aerosol concentration varies as function of time, responding to seasonal\n\nvariations in stratospheric circulation, latitude and altitude. Eruptions without recorded\n\nseasonality have been assumed to occur in April, which introduce a 10% uncertainty,\n\nmostly in high-latitude sulfate deposition (Gao et al., 2008).\n\nFigure 2.2: Volcanic mass evolution | Period between 850 and 2005 used in the CESM-\nLME. Three of the greatest explosions from the LM are marked: Samalas (1258), Kuwae\n(1452) and 1815 Tambora. Volcanic mass is in Tg (from Otto-Bliesner et al., 2016).\n\nTwo LM periods were marked by great and frequent volcanic activity: the last half of\n\nthe thirteenth century and the first half of the nineteenth century (Otto-Bliesner et al.,\n\n2016). Gao et al. (2008) state that the cumulative amount of volcanic sulfate flux was 2\n\nto 10 times larger during the thirteenth century than any other century within the LM.\n\nIn terms of estimated total global stratospheric volcanic sulfate aerosol injection, as seen\n\nin Figure 2.2, the largest eruptions were the Salamas in Indonesia during 1258 (257.9\n\n\n\n21 2.1. Data\n\nTg), followed by Kuwae of Vanuatu in 1452 (137.5 Tg) and in 1815 Tambora located in\n\nIndonesia estimated at 109.7 Tg (Gao et al., 2008; Otto-Bliesner et al., 2016).\n\n2.1.2 Auxiliary Data\n\nERSSTv5\n\nAs an auxiliary data for CESM-LME validation, monthly means of SST from the\n\nNOAA ERSSTv5 data set are used (Huang et al., 2017). This data set is derived from\n\nthe International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADs) and spatial\n\ncompleteness enhanced with statistical methods. The product has a spatial resolution\n\nof 2? and cover January 1854 up to 2015. The data set is available on&lt;https://data.\n\nnodc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00927>. For the present study the\n\nperiod between 1980 and 2005 is used, with focus on the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption.\n\nSODA 3.4.1\n\nThe SODA version 3.4.1 is an estimate of the evolving state of the ocean (Carton\n\nand Giese, 2008). SODA uses an ocean general circulation model (GFDL MOM5/SIS)\n\nto assimilate available in situ temperature and salinity profiles, also data from satellite.\n\nThe product is a gridded data set of monthly values from 1980 to 2015, at 0.5? horizontal\n\nresolution and 40 vertical levels (Carton and Giese, 2008).\n\nAccording to Carton et al. (2018), the version 3.4.1 of SODA includes an active sea\n\nice component and is forced by European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts\n\n(ECMWF) ERA-Interim (Dee and Uppala, 2008). For more details and a complete\n\noverview of the SODA reanalysis methodology, the reader is referred to Carton and\n\nGiese (2008). The data set is available online at&lt;http://www.atmos.umd.edu/~ocean/\n\nindex_files/soda3.4.1_mn_download.htm>. As ERSSTv5, here the period between\n\n1980 and 2005 is used, with focus on the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo explosion.\n\nhttps://data.nodc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00927\nhttps://data.nodc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00927\nhttp://www.atmos.umd.edu/~ocean/index_files/soda3.4.1_mn_download.htm\nhttp://www.atmos.umd.edu/~ocean/index_files/soda3.4.1_mn_download.htm\n\n\nChapter 2. MATERIAL AND METHODS 22\n\n2.2 Analysis\n\nAnalysis has been divided in periods: in the Subsection 2.2.1 the LM eruptions from\n\n850 to 1850, that uses CESM-LME simulation results. Described in Subsection 2.2.2\n\nthe 1991 modern eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, that includes also a comparison with the\n\nauxiliary data sets.\n\n2.2.1 Last Millennium eruptions analysis\n\nConsidering the average of 15 ensemble members, 10 full forcing and 5 volcanic only,\n\nthe analysis has been restricted to the period 850-1850, to exclude any CO2-induced\n\ntrends in the full forcing runs. The ensemble average is used as in Goosse et al. (2005)\n\nto reduce the internal variability. All anomalies presented in the LM eruptions analysis\n\nare calculated relative to the 850-1850 mean.\n\nEruptions are divided into three classes according to Stevenson et al. (2016) and\n\nGao et al. (2008). First, the authors only selected eruptions with a peak aerosol mass\n\nmixing ratio greater than 10?8. Then, the aerosol mass mixing ratio is integrated during\n\nthe eruption year and two subsequent years over the northern and southern hemisphere.\n\nLastly the ratio between them is calculated to distinguish the eruption source (Stevenson\n\net al., 2016). From this, as described in Stevenson et al. (2016), eruptions have been\n\nclassified as Northern, Southern and Tropical. In this study, analysis has been restricted\n\nto Tropical and Southern eruptions as shown in Table 2.1.\n\nTable 2.1: Years of eruptions | Eruptions are divided in Tropical and Southern regions\n(from Stevenson et al., 2016).\n\nRegion Years\n\nTropical 1258 (Samalas), 1284, 1809, 1815 (Tambora)\n\nSouthern 1275, 1341, 1452 (Kuwae)\n\nFor the composite analysis only the austral summer (DJF) is considered, because it\n\nis the season with less sea-ice extension in the Weddell Sea, also follows results from\n\n\n\n23 2.2. Analysis\n\nStevenson et al. (2016). Church et al. (2005) results show that the maximum response\n\nto volcanic activity is in the summer, for both hemispheres, which is probably result\n\nof shallow mixed layers, thus simplifying heat flux change. The year of the eruption is\n\nreferred as Yr 0 in the composite maps, which averaged all 7 eruption in Table 2.1 for the\n\n15 ensemble members, therefore 105 events in total. The composite evolution starts in\n\nthe year before the eruption (Yr -1) and includes the 6 subsequent years (Yr +1 to +6).\n\nThe difference maps between composite years are all subtracted from the year before the\n\neruption (Yr -1), as a reference to quantify the changes due to volcanism.\n\nAll the significance levels presented are determined according to the Wilcoxon Rank-\n\nSum (WRS) test as in Stevenson et al. (2016). The set of the composite years (all the 105\n\nevents) are compared with the full time series from all ensemble members. This is the\n\nnonparametric version of the t-test since it only makes the assumption of independence\n\nbetween the time series and equal variance, but not that the data has a known distribution.\n\nThe reader is referred to Gibbons and Chakraborti (2003) for detailed information about\n\nthe WRS test.\n\nTo assess the evolution of the changes induced by volcanic eruptions, a superposed\n\nepoch analysis (SEA) is used. This is a common analysis tool to observe the average\n\nchanges through a series of composites of multiple events as in Bothe et al. (2015); Sigl\n\net al. (2015) and Lehner et al. (2016). It is a statistical method, that utilizes basically\n\narithmetic calculations to resolve significant signal to noise problems. The SEA involves\n\ncomposing data into \"key-date\" and then comparing means of the composite years, in\n\nwhich a common response to a forcing event should emerge in the composite average\n\n(Brad Adams et al., 2003, Supplementary Material).\n\nAnalysis is divided in three subsections considering ocean depth and water mass\n\ncharacteristics as follows: (i) Surface, (ii) Vertical and (iii) Water Masses.\n\nSurface\n\nTo verify the first impact of multiple volcanic eruptions on the South Atlantic Ocean\n\nSST, sea surface salinity (SSS), wind stress components, zonal wind stress (TAUX) and\n\n\n\nChapter 2. MATERIAL AND METHODS 24\n\nmeridional wind stress (TAUY) and velocity components at the surface, zonal veloc-\n\nity (UVEL) and meridional velocity (VVEL) are analyzed. Zonal averages, anomaly\n\ncomposite maps and its significance (i.e., WRS test), application of SEA and evaluation\n\nof specific events during the LM are used.\n\nVertical\n\nPotential temperature and salinity behavior are examined relative to ocean depth.\n\nChanges in specific latitudinal sections such as Greenwich Meridian (0W) and Antarc-\n\ntic Peninsula (54W) are quantified. Moreover, a vertical Hovm\u00f6ller is computed (e.g.,\n\nGleckler et al., 2006) to understand the propagation in depth of the volcanic induced\n\nsignals.\n\nFinally, for the Weddell Sea the volcanic perturbation is quantified at the location of\n\nthe historical SR4 WOCE (World Ocean Circulation Experiment) transect, this section\n\ncaptures the inflow and outflow of Weddell circulation.\n\nWater Masses\n\nTS analysis (characteristic of water mass) is used, as an approach to verify if there\n\nis any signal from multiple eruptions in the water masses structure. The diagram is\n\nrestricted to the Weddell Sea average, comparing each composite year with the LM\n\nclimatological mean.\n\n2.2.2 Modern Eruption Analysis: Mt. Pinatubo\n\nTo validate changes observed in the multiple eruption composite from the LM, the\n\n1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption is examined. For this analysis the study area is restricted\n\nto 70W-30E and south of 50S, from 1990 to 1997. All anomalies presented for the\n\nmodern eruption are calculated relative to 1980-2005 climatological mean. In addition,\n\nthe anomaly time series is de-trended, as a way to minimize recent trends influence in\n\nthe results.\n\n\n\n3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nResults and discussion are divided in three main sections. The characterization\n\nof the LM surface properties such as SST, SSS, TAUX and TAUY, profiles of potential\n\ntemperature and salinity, and a brief analysis of the CESM-LME time series are described\n\nin Section 3.1. The LM eruptions composite results are shown in Section 3.2. The last\n\nSection 3.3 is a comparison of LM results by putting the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in\n\ncontext, which is directly related to the second specific objective (ii).\n\n3.1 General aspects of the Last Millennium\n\nThis section is an introduction to the LM mean climatology, which is used as com-\n\nparison to the perturbations due to LM great volcanic eruptions. It is subdivided in\n\nMean Surface Climatology (Subsection 3.1.1), which also includes seasonal analysis and\n\ndifferences between the LM and the Present Day (PD) (1980-2005). The vertical mean\n\nstate is shown in Subsection 3.1.2. Followed by a brief time series and ensemble spread\n\nanalysis (Subsection 3.1.3).\n\n3.1.1 Mean Surface Climatology\n\nA comparison between the LM (850-1850) and the PD (1980-2005) periods is shown\n\nin Figures 3.1 and 3.2 for SST, SSS, TAUX and TAUY. Despite some changes in the\n\nmagnitude, the spatial pattern in both periods is the same (Figures 3.1a,c and 3.2a), thus\n\nit is only shown the LM climatological mean (left-hand column) and the difference between\n\nPD and LM (right-hand column). As depicted in Figure 3.1b, SST mean climatology is\n\nsignificantly (at 90% level) increased 0.3?C in the PD than in the LM.\n\n\n\nChapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 26\n\nFigure 3.1: Sea surface climatological means | LM (850-1850) (a) SST [?C] and (c)\nSSS climatological means. Difference between the LM and PD (1980-2005) climatological\nmeans for (b) SST [?C] and (d) SSS. Significance levels are determined according to a\nt-test, and values that are insignificant at 90% are marked with crosses.\n\nThe same is shown for the SSS field, which presents regional positive and negative\n\ndifferences (Figure 3.1d). The Drake Passage has been significantly saltier (at 90% level)\n\nduring the LM, at the same time that the northern Antarctic Peninsula and the South\n\nAmerica have been fresher. The ACC region is the freshest region on the domain in\n\ncontrast to further northern regions (Figure 3.1c).\n\nWind stress is the surface field that has changed the most from the LM to the PD.\n\nFigure 3.2b shows a clear intensification of the westerlies of about 0.01N m?2.\n\n\n\n27 3.1. General aspects of the Last Millennium\n\nFigure 3.2: Wind stress climatological mean | Wind stress [N m?2] (a) LM (850-1850)\nclimatological mean and (b) difference between the LM and PD (1980-2005) climatological\nmeans. The wind stress magnitude is represented in the background and the vectors\nrepresent the direction.\n\nA quick comparison with reanalysis data (SODA) is done (figures not shown) for\n\nthe common period of 1980-2005. Results point that the South Atlantic Ocean average\n\nin both data sets is in agreement. For the SST the field the average is of 10.32?C and\n\n10.11?C for CESM-LME and SODA, respectively. The SSS averaged field is respectively\n\n34.25 and 34.64, while for TAUX the average is of 0.049N m?2 and TAUY of 0.0018N\n\nm?2 in CESM-LME compared to TAUX 0.042N m?2 and 0.0033N m?2 TAUY for SODA.\n\nIn addition, CESM-LME has been validated by Fasullo et al. (2017), reproducing key\n\nfeatures after Mt. Pinatubo eruption compared to reanalysis.\n\nSeasonal Climatology\n\nResults in the next sections are shown only for the austral summer (DJF) and with\n\nthe focus on the LM. However, a brief seasonal description is conducted in the surface\n\nfields. Figures 3.3 and 3.4 show the mean climatology for the austral summer (DJF,\n\nleft-hand column) and winter (JJA, right-hand column).\n\nSST and SSS seasonal fields (Figure 3.3) contain the -1.4?C isotherm, which is the sea\n\nwater freezing point representing the sea-ice extension in the CESM-LME(Otto-Bliesner\n\net al., 2016). The sea-ice extension is an important feature to be noticed, since our\n\nanalysis includes the Weddell Sea region, that is highly susceptible to sea-ice seasonal\n\n\n\nChapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 28\n\nvariability.\n\nSurface salinity field (Figure 3.3c,d), as the SST, also shows meaningful seasonal\n\ndifferences. The ACC region (45-60S) is fresher during the austral winter (JJA, Figure\n\n3.3d) and the Weddell Sea is saltier during the austral summer (DJF, Figure 3.3d).\n\nFigure 3.3: Seasonal climatological means | LM climatological mean for the SST [?C]\nfield in the (a) austral summer (DJF) and (b) austral winter (JJA). The same for the\nSSS field (c) austral summer (DJF) and (d) austral winter (JJA). Black continuous line\nrepresent the -1.4?C isotherm.\n\nA more intense wind stress is seen during austral winter (JJA) in Figure 3.4f. With the\n\nmeridional component (Figure 3.4c,d) the dominant component of the wind circulation\n\nover the Weddell Sea, mainly near the Antarctic Peninsula. The wind circulation over\n\nthe Weddell Sea is a cyclonic gyre and much less intense than the westerlies belt, but is\n\nwell represented.\n\n\n\n29 3.1. General aspects of the Last Millennium\n\nFigure 3.4: Wind stress seasonal climatological mean | LM climatological mean\nfor the austral summer (DJF) in left-hand column (a) TAUX, (c) TAUY and (e) total\nwind stress [N m?2], magnitude in the background and the vectors represent the direction.\nRight-hand column show the austral winter (JJA), respectively (b) TAUX, (d) TAUY\nand (f) total wind stress.\n\n\n\nChapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 30\n\n3.1.2 Vertical Sections\n\nZonally averaged sections of the South Atlantic Ocean are shown in Figure 3.5 during\n\nthe LM austral summer (DJF) between 30S and 70S, from the near surface to 3000m.\n\nPotential temperature and salinity sections help verify how the main water masses in the\n\nregion are represented on average during this period.\n\nFigure 3.5: South Atlantic climatological zonal sections | (a) potential temperature\n[?C], the black line represent the 0?C isotherm and (b) salinity, both for the austral\nsummer (DJF).\n\nThe potential temperature section show the expected gradient of warmer waters at\n\nthe surface and north of 45S, accompanied by colder waters in the deeper layers and in\n\nthe southernmost region (Figure 3.5a). Temperatures below 0?C are located south of\n\n55S, related to Antarctic Surface Waters (Talley et al., 2011). Figure 3.5b depicts the\n\nsalinity minimum, of 33.5, at the surface south of 45S that spreads north representing\n\nthe AAIW. The saltier water in the deeper layers represents the NADW, as compared\n\nto A12 WOCE section (Boyer et al., 2013).\n\nTo verify how CESM-LME represents the Weddell Sea water masses during the LM,\n\nthe typical SR4 WOCE transect (Figure 3.6a) for the potential temperature (Figure 3.6b),\n\nsalinity (Figure 3.7a) and VVEL (Figure 3.7b) are presented from the surface to 1800m\n\ndepth.\n\n\n\n31 3.1. General aspects of the Last Millennium\n\nFigure 3.6: WOCE SR4 transect | (a) Bathymetry map for the Weddell Sea and\nSouth Atlantic Ocean showing the location of WOCE SR4 transect in black.

From east to west, the warm core of WDW in the inflow\nand outflow regions are denoted as core. (c) Climatological LM mean of the potential\ntemperature [?C] for the WOCE SR4 section during the austral summer (DJF). The\ninflow and outflow regions are marked, respectively 71.5S,11W and 63.5S,53W.\n\nPotential temperature shows a defined warmer core of 1.5?C from 200 to 1000m (3.6c),\n\nwhich is consistent with the representation of the WDW in Figure 3.6b (Robertson et al.,\n\n2002), it also agrees with Jullion et al. (2014) (the reader is referred to Figure 2 in Jullion\n\net al., 2014). In addition, the warmer core of the WDW is on averaged around 500m\n\n(e.g., Meredith et al., 2008; Kerr et al., 2009), which matches with Figure 3.6c. See that\n\nFigure 3.6c is mirrored from what is shown in Figure 3.6b and its section is deeper. The\n\nwaters below 0?C are at the surface above 200m, representing the Continental Shelf Water\n\n(Talley et al., 2011) and the Winter Water in the eastern region (Jullion et al., 2014).\n\nFigure 3.7a represents the salinity that also depicts a core below 400m of saltier\n\n\n\nChapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 32\n\nwater (34.65 to 34.9), which is the WDW representation (Kerr et al., 2009; Jullion et al.,\n\n2014). Maximum salinity core is on average located around 800m (Meredith et al., 2008),\n\nagreeing with Figure 3.7a. At the surface the salinity is smaller, ranging from 34.3 to 34,\n\napproximately.\n\nFigure 3.7: WOCE SR4 transect | LM climatological mean for (a) salinity and (b)\nmeridional velocity [cm s?1] for the austral summer (DJF). The inflow and outflow regions\nare marked, respectively 71.5S,11W and 63.5S,53W.\n\nThe meridional velocity (Figure 3.7b) corresponds to the Weddell Gyre circulation\n\n(e.g., Nicholls et al., 2009). At the subsurface the inflow region is evident in the east\n\nWeddell Sea edge (71.5S,11W), where the VVEL reaches ? 1cm s?1; and an outflow of\n\n2.5cm s?1 in the western region (63.5S,53W).\n\n\n\n33 3.1. General aspects of the Last Millennium\n\n3.1.3 Time Series\n\nHere the time series for the surface properties of the 15 ensemble members average\n\nand the ensemble spread1 are analyzed to quantify uncertainties and verify the volcanic\n\nsignal presence (Figures 3.8 to 3.10). All time series shown are the surface average for the\n\nSouth Atlantic Ocean (70W-30E, south of 30S), for yearly anomalies calculated relative\n\nto the 850-2005 climatological mean. All figures show the mean standard deviation of the\n\nensemble members (dotted line), according to Goosse et al. (2005) this gives an indication\n\nof the variability related to the ensemble set. Moreover, using it as a reference provides\n\na measure of the robustness of the system response to the volcanic forcing.\n\nThe SST anomaly time series varies on average between -0.1 and 0.2?C during the LM\n\nand centennial features are well represented in Figure 3.8 (Crowley et al., 2008; Mann\n\net al., 2009). Temperature shifts such as the warmer Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA),\n\non average shows positive anomalies of 0.1?C from 950 to 1250, denoted in red. During\n\nthe LIA (1400-1700) the SST anomaly is on average negative (in blue). Both periods\n\nlimits are determined following Mann et al. (2009). The recent period 1980-2005, in green,\n\nshows evident warming trend of SST reaching anomalies of 0.4?C.\n\nFigure 3.8: SST [?C] anomaly time series | Annual ensemble average and spread for\n850-2005 period. The dotted line is the \u00b11 standard deviation representing the internal\nvariability. The black triangles represent the selected volcanic eruptions. Colors represent\ndifferent periods that are described in the legend.\n\n1The spread of the ensemble members is the standard deviation of the averaged members, which is\ncalculated for each month of the time series.\n\n\n\nChapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 34\n\nAll selected years of volcanic events are marked in triangles in the x-axis in Figure 3.8.\n\nThe more striking signal in the SST time series is that all volcanic events are related to\n\nan abrupt cooling (Figure 3.8). The cooling signal is expected after an eruption due to\n\nthe radiative effect (e.g. Church et al., 2005; Stenchikov et al., 2009; Mignot et al., 2011;\n\nKim and Kim, 2012; Ding et al., 2014; Stenchikov, 2016). The volcanic signal in the SST\n\nis very well represented, accounting for a small spread between the ensemble members.\n\nAlso, all volcanic events show a negative anomaly greater than the internal variability,\n\nrepresented by the dotted line in Figure 3.8 by one standard deviation.\n\nThe largest South Atlantic Ocean average response is to the 1258 Samalas eruption,\n\na cooling of 0.5?C. This is one of the largest eruption during the LM, observations from\n\nproxy data show that the greatest surface cooling in this period is after the Samalas\n\neruption (Sicre et al., 2011). A cooling of 1?C is observed in the whole Atlantic Ocean\n\nSST in Mignot et al. (2011), the largest magnitude in the signal is probably because of\n\nthe different averaged areas. The SSS ensemble spread is shown in Figure 3.9. There are\n\nno differences between the LM periods as in the SST.\n\nFigure 3.9: SSS anomaly time series | Annual ensemble average and spread for 850-\n2005 period. The dotted line is the \u00b11 standard deviation representing the internal\nvariability. The black triangles represent the selected volcanic eruptions. Colors represent\ndifferent periods that are described in the legend.\n\nHowever, the response due to some of the eruptions is evident. For the largest\n\neruptions, such as Samalas (1258) and Kuwae (1452), the South Atlantic Ocean salinity\n\npresents an abrupt positive anomaly (?0.04) that is larger than the range of internal\n\nvariability (dotted line in Figure 3.9). Other studies in regions such as the middle,\n\n\n\n35 3.1. General aspects of the Last Millennium\n\nnorthern high latitudes and in the Southern Ocean, have also shown an increase at the\n\nsea surface salinity after eruptions (e.g., Stenchikov et al., 2009; Kim and Kim, 2012; Ding\n\net al., 2014; Pausata et al., 2015), fact that is consistent with a reduction of precipitation\n\nfound in Trenberth and Dai (2007).\n\nUsing a fully coupled model Mignot et al. (2011) observed anomalous negative salinity\n\nafter eruptions in the northern subtropics, which is consequence of increased surface\n\nfreshwater fluxes (i.e., precipitation and river runoff) in the same region. The difference\n\nin the results may be related to specific regional characteristics, given the greater presence\n\nof continents in the northern subtropics compared to the southern subtropics and higher\n\nsouth latitudes. The TAUX and TAUY time series are represented in Figure 3.11, in\n\nwhich the centennial changes are not evident during the LM. Because there is a difference\n\nof approximately one order in the magnitude between each component of the wind stress\n\n(TAUX > TAUY) the anomaly scale for each figures is different.\n\nFigure 3.10: Wind stress components time series | (a) TAUX anomaly [N m?2]\nand (b) TAUY anomaly [N m?2] time series of annual ensemble average and spread for\n850-2005 period. The dotted line is the \u00b11 standard deviation representing the internal\nvariability. The black triangles represent the selected volcanic eruptions. Colors represent\ndifferent periods that are described in the legend.\n\n\n\nChapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 36\n\nThe zonal wind stress response to volcanic eruptions is not clear (Figure 3.10a,b).\n\nThe wind stress change is evaluated in detail in Section 3.2.1. Even though there is a\n\nlarge ensemble spread, in the PD the wind stress presents a positive trend (green line in\n\nFigure 3.10a), TAUX increases from the late 1950, which agrees with the positive trend\n\nin the SAM (Marshall, 2003; Thompson et al., 2011; Abram et al., 2014). In the same\n\nperiod TAUY decreases on average (Figure 3.10b).\n\n3.2 Last Millennium eruptions\n\nThis section presents the composite results considering all seven eruptions from Table\n\n2.1 only for the austral summer (DJF). Results are divided in Subsection 3.2.1 that shows\n\nanalysis for the surface air-sea properties, including anomaly maps and LM individual\n\nevents evaluation as well. Subsection 3.2.2 discusses the results related to the vertical\n\nproperties such as potential temperature and salinity. A brief analysis of water masses\n\nchanges due to volcanism is presented in Subsection 3.2.3. Finally, results focused on the\n\nWeddell Sea are described in Subsection 3.2.4.\n\n3.2.1 Surface Analysis\n\nZonal Average\n\nThe composite zonal average is the first approach to observe how the air-sea properties\n\nare responding to the volcanic eruptions. It averages the whole South Atlantic Ocean\n\ndefined in the study area (Section 1.2) from 30S to 70S. The continuous black line in\n\nFigures 3.11 and 3.12 represents the internal variability limit2. In the SST zonal average\n\nshown in Figure 3.11a all anomalies are negative, but there is meaningful zonal difference\n\nin the averaged volcanic response. Yr +1 (red asterisks) displays the largest response\n\nto volcanism, fact that agrees with other studies accounting for the different averaged\n\nregions (Stenchikov et al., 2009; Balmaseda et al., 2013; Ding et al., 2014).\n2Calculated as \u00b11 standard deviation based on the averaged ensemble members spread.\n\n\n\n37 3.2. Last Millennium eruptions\n\nKim and Kim (2012) simulation results depict the largest cooling in the second year\n\nafter the eruption (Yr +2). Contrary to Mignot et al. (2011) for the North Atlantic Ocean\n\nand Church et al. (2005) in the global average, that have observed a faster response, with\n\nsurface temperatures decrease in the year of the eruption (Yr 0). This is also not observed\n\nin the South Atlantic given that during the year of the eruption (Yr 0 in blue squares)\n\nthe anomaly is almost zero. Nonetheless, Mignot et al. (2011) discuss that the poleward\n\ncooling extension is stronger on the first year following the eruption, at least in the\n\nnorthern hemisphere, fact that agrees with results presented here.\n\nFigure 3.11: South Atlantic zonal average | (a) SST anomaly [?C] and (b) SSS. Each\nline represents a composite year that is described in the legend. The black vertical line\nis the \u00b11 standard deviation representing the internal variability.\n\nSST at Yr +1 shows a cold anomaly peak of -0.6?C, that is in the range of Stenchikov\n\net al. (2009) simulation results between 1 and 0.4K. Fact that also agrees with Kim and\n\nKim (2012) that have observed a cooling in their model results from 0.25 to 0.8?C, the\n\nhigher limit is for LM eruptions. The same magnitude of a negative anomaly is present\n\nin two different regions, 30S and ?55S (Figure 3.11a). Balmaseda et al. (2013) observed\n\nwith ORAs4 reanalysis for the Pacific Ocean that the greatest signal after eruptions is\n\n\n\nChapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 38\n\naround 30N.\n\nThe negative anomaly in temperature around 65S (i.e., Figure 3.11) recovers to the\n\nthe background condition of Yr -1 (black diamonds) in the second year after the eruption\n\n(Yr +2, magenta crosses). At the same time that the northernmost (? 30S) negative\n\nanomaly develops in 1-3 years. Pausata et al. (2015) have also observed a cooling that\n\ndevelops in 1-3 years after the eruption for the Pacific Ocean. Stenchikov et al. (2009)\n\nshow the same for the northern hemisphere, authors discuss that this evolution happens\n\nuntil volcanic aerosols vanish from the atmosphere. In the CMIP5 models the evolution\n\nof the cooling due to volcanism is faster, the cooling is the lowest 1-2 years following\n\neruptions (Ding et al., 2014). However, Ding et al. (2014) mention a longer relaxation\n\ntime of SST back to its pre-eruption value of 5 to 7 years, which is close to what observed\n\nin this study. The difference in the recovery time in each latitude suggests that the\n\nperturbation due to volcanic eruptions in polar regions (south of 50S) may recover faster\n\nthan in the subtropical regions (north of 50S).\n\nOn the other hand, changes in the SSS (Figure 3.11b) are not as evident as the SST\n\nones. The Yr +1 and +2 (red asterisks and magenta crosses, respectively) depict the\n\nsame response to the volcanic event, mainly in the region between 40-50S with positive\n\nanomalies reaching 0.06. Stenchikov et al. (2009) have also observed in simulations an\n\nincrease in salinity in the middle northern latitudes, which is consistent with reduction\n\nof precipitation (Trenberth and Dai, 2007). Using results from CMIP5, Ding et al. (2014)\n\nhave observed increased sea surface salinity after the 1871-2005 eruptions. Anomalies\n\ncome back to the background Yr -1 (black diamonds) and also get smaller than the internal\n\nvariability, immediately at Yr +3 (green triangles). This is different from what is seen\n\nin the SST behavior, that is out of the internal variability range, in the northernmost\n\ndomain, even in Yr +6.\n\n\n\n39 3.2. Last Millennium eruptions\n\nDuring the first year after the eruption (Yr +1), a negative anomaly of -0.04 around\n\n55S is also observed. This agrees with negative anomaly in the northern subtropics during\n\nthe year following the eruption shown in Mignot et al. (2011). The authors attribute this\n\nanomaly to greater freshwater fluxes due to eruptions. In addition, Kim and Kim (2012)\n\ndiscuss the contribution of modified ocean convection related to changes in the SST, in\n\nthe contrasting zonal salinity anomalies. The Southern Ocean is a region of positive SSS\n\nanomaly after eruptions (Kim and Kim, 2012), which is also observed in Figure 3.11b. A\n\npositive anomaly of 0.04 in 60S during Yr +1 that extends into Yr +2 spreads poleward\n\nreaching values of 0.06 in its southernmost extension.\n\nBoth, zonal (TAUX) and meridional (TAUY) wind stress responses to the volcanic\n\nevent are very well defined in the first year after the eruption (Yr +1, red asterisks in\n\nFigure 3.12). Figures 3.12a and 3.12b, TAUX and TAUY respectively, show the largest\n\nanomalies located in the same latitudes, however with opposing signs.\n\nFigure 3.12: South Atlantic zonal average | (a) TAUX anomaly [N m?2] and (b)\nTAUY [N m?2]. Each line represents a composite year that is described in the legend.\nThe black vertical line is the \u00b11 standard deviation representing the internal variability.\n\n\n\nChapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 40\n\nDuring Yr +1 TAUX shows a positive anomaly of 0.025N m?2 that peaks at 60S,\n\nwhile at 45S the anomaly is negative 0.02N m?2 (Figure 3.12a). Results also show that\n\nTAUY largest anomaly happens during Yr +1, with maximum values at 45S ? 0.01N\n\nm?2, while at 60S the anomaly is negative 0.006N m?2 (Figure 3.12b). Both, TAUX and\n\nTAUY zonal average anomalies decrease in the subsequent years, getting closer to the\n\nbackground condition of Yr -1 (black diamonds) at Yr -3 (green triangles). Although Kim\n\nand Kim (2012) do not find any volcanic related changes in the wind circulation, present\n\nresults suggest an increase in the wind magnitude after eruption (e.g., Stenchikov et al.,\n\n2009; Karpechko et al., 2010; Zanchettin et al., 2014; Stenchikov, 2016). Next, composite\n\nmaps analysis focus in understanding the southern hemisphere wind changes after the\n\neruptions, since this subject that is still in debate.\n\nComposites Maps\n\nExamination of the surface spatial distribution of the anomalies is useful to verify if\n\nthe volcanic eruptions have a different impact depending on the region and to verify how\n\nit changes from one year to the other. Figures 3.13 to 3.16 represent air-sea properties\n\nstarting in composite Yr +1, since the volcanic response is not significant at 90% level\n\nin the year of the explosion (Yr 0). TAUX and TAUY composite maps are only shown\n\nbetween Yr +1 and Yr +4 (Figures 3.13 and 3.14), because these are the years that have\n\ngreater areas where the anomaly is significant at 90% level.\n\nZonal wind stress anomalies are the largest in the first year after the eruption as\n\nseen in Figure 3.13a and in Figure 3.12a as well. Both results depict anomalies that are\n\nconsistent with Stenchikov et al. (2009). The authors point to a decrease of TAUX at 50S,\n\nwhere this core of the tropospheric jet is located, and an increase at 70S. Results (Figure\n\n3.13a) show significant negative anomaly at 45S and positive anomaly at 65S, suggesting a\n\npoleward shift of the westerlies. This poleward shift of the prevailing westerlies is further\n\nexplored in Section 3.2.4. Even after smaller eruptions than those of the LM, such as\n\nMt. Pinatubo and El Chich\u00f3n, westerlies intensification is seen (Karpechko et al., 2010).\n\nIn contrast, other studies do not report changes in the zonal wind in any region of the\n\n\n\n41 3.2. Last Millennium eruptions\n\nglobe, such as Kim and Kim (2012). For the southern hemisphere, Robock et al. (2007)\n\nalso do not report tropospheric circulation changes due Mt. Pinatubo eruption.\n\nFigure 3.13: Zonal wind stress composites | TAUX [N m?2] response to selected\neruptions for (a) Yr +1, (b) Yr +2,(c) Yr +3 and (d) Yr +4. Shown only for the austral\nsummer (DJF). Significance levels are determined according to the WRS test, and values\nthat are insignificant at 90% are marked with crosses.\n\nAlterations in the wind system are expected after large eruptions, because of the\n\nheating of the tropical stratosphere by volcanic aerosols (Robock, 2000; Timmreck, 2012).\n\nThis results in a stronger meridional temperature gradient (Robock, 2000; Roscoe and\n\nHaigh, 2007), then, via thermal wind balance, it translates to strengthened polar vortex,\n\nas observed in the northern hemisphere (Robock et al., 2007; Otter\u00e5, 2008; Timmreck,\n\n2012), thus stronger winds (Karpechko et al., 2010). Results from here are in agreement\n\nwith what is expected from the dynamical atmosphere response to volcanic activity.\n\nDuring Yr +2 (Figure 3.13b) the anomaly decays reaching values around 0.004N m?2,\n\nbut continues significant at 90% level. After, during the third subsequent year (Yr +3,\n\nFigure 3.13c) the negative anomaly seems to have been displaced to the south, while the\n\n\n\nChapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 42\n\npositive anomaly in the Weddell Sea region is not significant anymore. During Yr +4\n\n(Figure 3.13d) only some portions of the field are still significant. This suggests that for\n\nthe zonal wind stress the volcanic signal persist up to Yr +3.\n\nNote that the ENSO connection with the wind circulation and volcanic activity is not\n\nexaminated in this work. Li et al. (2013) discuss that ENSO is not that important before\n\n1880. Moreover, McGraw et al. (2016) point to a more positive SAM index, which implies\n\na more intense westerly circulation, after major tropical volcanic eruptions regardless of\n\nENSO state. Thus, results are relevant even if ENSO is not taken into account.\n\nThe meridional wind stress perturbation shows an interesting pattern at Yr +1 (Figure\n\n3.14a), a significant positive anomaly of 0.01N m?2 in the northernmost region from 30S\n\nto 50S and in the Weddell Sea eastern boundary. This is accompanied by a negative\n\nanomaly of the same magnitude in the south of Weddell Sea, specifically in the northern\n\nAntarctic Peninsula. Changes in the TAUY seems to be related to the poleward shift of\n\nthe westerlies, which is further explored in Section 3.2.4\n\nThe same TAUY positive anomaly in the Weddell Sea is present during the second\n\nsubsequent year (Figure 3.14b), however in the northern Antarctic Peninsula there is a\n\npositive anomaly of 0.0075N m?2. At the same time that the northernmost region shows\n\na small (-0.0025N m?2), but significant negative anomaly. During Yr +3 (Figure 3.14c)\n\nmost of the anomalies in the study region are not significant. In the following year the\n\nanomalies are significant again, but smaller than during Yr +1, probably not related to\n\nthe volcanic response (Figure 3.14d). Although TAUY anomalies last less (only to Yr\n\n+2) than TAUX, the response to volcanism is meaningful. In addition, it has been little\n\nexplored before, yet its an important wind component of the Weddell circulation.\n\n\n\n43 3.2. Last Millennium eruptions\n\nFigure 3.14: Meridional wind stress composites | TAUY [N m?2] response to selected\neruptions for (a) Yr +1, (b) Yr +2,(c) Yr +3 and (d) Yr +4. Shown only for the austral\nsummer (DJF). Significance levels are determined according to the WRS test, and values\nthat are insignificant at 90% are marked with crosses.\n\nSST and SSS composite results are shown between Yr +1 and Yr +5 in Figures 3.15\n\nand 3.16. The cold anomaly north of 60S in the SST field shown in Figure 3.15a is\n\nwhat is expected as the thermodynamic response to volcanic explosions (e.g., Robock,\n\n2000; Church et al., 2005; Stenchikov et al., 2009; Mignot et al., 2011; Timmreck, 2012;\n\nDing et al., 2014; Pausata et al., 2015; Stenchikov, 2016). Figure 3.15a shows negative\n\nanomalies ranging between 0.2 and 0.8?C. However, a significant positive temperature\n\nanomaly in the Weddell Sea is also seen in Yr +1, that reaches 0.8?C. Yr +2 (Figure 3.15b)\n\nstill shows a strong negative anomaly in the northernmost region, the positive temperature\n\nanomaly in the Weddell Sea seems to have spread and is less intense. The same is observed\n\nin Yr +3 (Figure 3.15c). A plausible mechanism explaining the anomalous positive SST\n\nafter eruptions is discussed in Section 3.2.4.\n\n\n\nChapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 44\n\nFigure 3.15: SST composites | SST [?C] response to selected eruptions for (a) Yr +1,\n(b) Yr +2,(c) Yr +3, (d) Yr +4 and (e) Yr +5. Shown only for the austral summer\n(DJF). Significance levels are determined according to the WRS test, and values that are\ninsignificant at 90% are marked with crosses.\n\nDuring Yr +4 (Figure 3.14d) the cold anomaly in the north domain has become\n\nsmaller than in Yr +1, yet significant. In the same year there is a warm plume in the\n\nDrake Passage, which is also observed in Mignot et al. (2011), significant from years +3\n\nto +5.\n\nIn the following year (Figure 3.15e, Yr +5) anomalies are similar to the previous year,\n\nonly with decreased warm surface anomaly. Thus, the volcanic signal in the SST persists\n\nfrom four to five years after the eruption, fact that agrees with Church et al. (2005) results.\n\nOn the other hand, Stenchikov et al. (2009) and Kim and Kim (2012) have observed\n\nSST recovery in the third year after the eruption. In fact, the signal persistence seems\n\nto be very dependent on the region, which points to the importance of regional analysis\n\nfollowing eruptions.\n\nIn the SSS field, during Yr +1 (Figure 3.16a), there is significant positive anomaly\n\nof 0.14, which shows two cores: one in the northern Weddell Sea near the Antarctic\n\nPeninsula and the other at 40S. The overall increased surface salinity after eruptions\n\n\n\n45 3.2. Last Millennium eruptions\n\nagrees with previous studies (e.g., Stenchikov et al., 2009; Kim and Kim, 2012; Ding et al.,\n\n2014; Stenchikov, 2016). Even though the anomalies are not located in regions of dense\n\nwater formation, the cold and saltier anomalies after eruptions have been suggested as an\n\nimportant factor responsible for strengthening the AMOC (Otter\u00e5 et al., 2010; Mignot\n\net al., 2011; McGregor et al., 2015; Pausata et al., 2015).\n\nFigure 3.16: SSS composites | SSS response to selected eruptions for (a) Yr +1, (b) Yr\n+2,(c) Yr +3, (d) Yr +4 and (e) Yr +5. Shown only for the austral summer (DJF). Signif-\nicance levels are determined according to the WRS test, and values that are insignificant\nat 90% are marked with crosses.\n\nIn the next year (Yr +2, Figure 3.16b), the salty cores remain almost the same, but\n\nare accompanied by a fresher anomaly of ? 0.1 at the South American coast. At Yr +3\n\nand +4 almost the same pattern of weaker positive anomaly in the Weddell Sea can be\n\nseen in Figures 3.16c and 3.17d, but during Yr +3 there is a stronger negative anomaly.\n\nMignot et al. (2011) observed a negative sea surface salinity anomaly as well, but in the\n\nnorthern subtropics, that was attributed to increased freshwater inputs. At the same\n\ntime, Trenberth and Dai (2007) discuss a decrease in global precipitation and discharge.\n\nFurther studies are necessary to understand the mechanism that controls the negative\n\nsalinity near South America in Earth System Models, which is not the present focus.\n\nFinally, during Yr +5 (Figure 3.16e) there is still large regions showing significant,\n\n\n\nChapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 46\n\nbut small anomalies, therefore the salinity seems to recover approximately within the\n\nsame period as the SST. This is different, from what is observed in Figure 3.21b, that\n\nshows salinity recovery after Yr +3, because of the averaged area that probably masks\n\nthe real spreading of the spatial anomaly.\n\nLast Millennium Individual Events\n\nTwo specific eruptions are analyzed to verify if there is volcano location dependency in\n\nthe air-sea properties response. All seven eruptions (Table 2.1) have been tested and two\n\nrepresentative ones from different location and intensities were chosen. The representative\n\ntropical eruption is the well known Tambora explosion on 10 April 1815 in the Indonesia\n\nregion. For the south hemisphere 1341 eruption is chosen (see Figure 2.2), the specific\n\nlocation of this eruption is not known. The individual events are shown only for the first\n\nand second austral summers after each eruption (Yr +1 and +2).\n\nIn the Tambora eruption the wind stress, shown in Figure 3.17c,f, has intensified\n\nduring the first austral summer after the eruption, as the same seen in the composite\n\nanalysis (Figure 3.13a). In the following year the anomaly gets weaker. The SST (Figure\n\n3.17a) also shows a pattern very similar to the composite average during the first year\n\nafter the eruption (Figure 3.15a), a cold anomaly in the northernmost region that reaches\n\n0.6?C and the anomalous warming in the Weddell Sea near the Antarctic Peninsula.\n\nHowever, it also shows a positive temperature anomaly in the central region of the South\n\nAtlantic Ocean, between 40S and 50S, that is not evident in the composite average.\n\n\n\n47 3.2. Last Millennium eruptions\n\nFigure 3.17: Tambora (1815) eruption | Response for Yr +1 (first line) and Yr +2\n(second line) for [(a),(d)] SST [?C], [(b),(e)] SSS and [(c),(f)] wind stress [N m?2] in\nwhich the magnitude is in the background and vectors represent the direction.\n\nIn the following year (Yr +2, Figure 3.17d) the positive temperature anomaly present\n\nin the Weddell Sea remains with the same magnitude. This is different from what is\n\nshown in the composite pattern, where the SST anomaly has decreased to half. It also\n\nseems to have spread northward mixing with the central anomaly present since Yr +1.\n\nSurface salinity (Figure 3.17a,e) shows a similar pattern to the composite average, strong\n\npositive anomalies 0.16 mainly in the northern Antarctic Peninsula and a core in 40-50S.\n\nIn addition to a fresh anomaly of the same magnitude at the South American coast that\n\nappears only in the second subsequent year.\n\nAs shown in Figure 3.18c,f, wind stress response to the 1341 eruption have also shown\n\na positive anomaly. Even though this volcanic eruption was weaker than the Tambora\n\nexplosion, the wind stress positive anomaly is of the same magnitude, but covering a\n\nsmaller area. The same happens for SSS (Figure 3.18b,e), with positive anomalies covering\n\nalmost the whole domain in Yr +1, decreasing in the following year.\n\n\n\nChapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 48\n\nFigure 3.18: 1341 eruption | 1341 eruption response for Yr +1 (first line) and Yr +2\n(second line) for [(a),(d)] SST [?C], [(b),(e)] SSS and [(c),(f)] wind stress [N m?2] in\nwhich the magnitude is in the background and vectors represent the direction.\n\nThe SST shows the same warming in the Weddell Sea region during the first year\n\nafter the eruption (Figure 3.18a), however the cold anomaly is much more spread out in\n\nthe region, reaching values of 0.8?C. This may be related to the volcano location that is\n\nin the southern hemisphere, so there is a stronger response in SST to the radiative effect.\n\nDuring Yr +2 (Figure 3.18d) the cold anomaly is zonal north of 50S, at the same time\n\nthat the positive anomaly has decreased and spread to the Weddell Sea interior.\n\nTherefore, the individual volcanic eruptions from the LM show overall the same\n\npattern of the composite average. Even though some differences have been pointed,\n\nthe anomalous warming in the Weddell Sea is present in all, thus it is not an effect of\n\nthe composite method. The size of the eruption affect the air-sea properties response\n\n(Meronen et al., 2012; Sigl et al., 2015), results (e.g., Figure 3.18c and 3.17c) show eruption\n\nsize dependency in the wind response. However, the size dependency may be masked by\n\nthe different volcano location.\n\n\n\n49 3.2. Last Millennium eruptions\n\n3.2.2 Vertical Analysis\n\nVertical Sections\n\nComposite years of the potential temperature section in the Greenwich Meridian (0W)\n\nare shown in Figure 3.19. The vertical sections starts from the first 15m, that is the first\n\nvertical level from the CESM-LME, to 3000m depth. There is an evident cold anomaly of\n\n0.4?C, mostly from 15m to 100m depth, between 60-50S and 40-30S that starts at Yr +1\n\n(Figure 3.19a). Fact that is consistent with Ding et al. (2014) findings, the authors have\n\nestimated a effective mixing depth in which the cooling is distributed of 85m. Stenchikov\n\net al. (2009) have pointed that the cold water begins to penetrate to depth around 40S,\n\nwhich agrees with what is observed in this vertical section. The anomalies spread into\n\ndepth first north of 50S, implying that the subtropical regions are probably responding\n\nfirst to the eruptions.\n\nIn the following year (Yr +2, Figure 3.19b) the cold anomaly has spread its signal\n\nin depth. South of 50S the anomaly near the surface disappears, but there is still a\n\ncold core between 100 and 250m. In contrast to the region north of 60S, where the cold\n\nanomaly is deeper around 1000m. As described in Mignot et al. (2011) and Kim and\n\nKim (2012) the cold anomaly reaches its largest depth 2 to 3 years after the eruption,\n\nwhich is explained by deep convective mixing. Even during Yr +6 there is still a small\n\ncold anomaly (? ?0.1?C) at depth. There are not changes in the isopycnals.\n\nThe potential temperature section near the Antarctic Peninsula (54W) has been also\n\nanalyzed to verify the spreading of the positive temperature anomaly already observed at\n\nthe surface (Figure 3.20). Contrary to the Greenwich Meridian section, during the first\n\nyear after the eruption (Figure 3.20a) there is a positive temperature anomaly (0.4?C)\n\nsouth of 60S, from 15m to 100m. At the same time, the cold anomaly of 0.4?C north of\n\n60S is present as in the 0W section, spreading to 100m depth.\n\n\n\nChapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 50\n\nFigure 3.19: Greenwich Meridian (0W) section | Composite potential temperature\n[?C] response to the selected eruptions. From Yr +1 to Yr +6 after the eruption, respec-\ntively [(a)-(f)]. Black lines represent isopycnals.\n\nIn the second austral summer after the eruption (Figure 3.20b) the positive temper-\n\nature anomaly has weaken and disappears from the surface at Yr +4, staying only at\n\nthe subsurface (Figure 3.20d). The positive temperature anomaly seems to sink because\n\nof the increased salinity in the same region, which is shown in Figure 3.21 and further\n\ndiscussed in the vertical Hovm\u00f6ller subsection.\n\n\n\n51 3.2. Last Millennium eruptions\n\nFigure 3.20: Antarctic Peninsula (54W) section | Composite potential tempera-\nture [?C] response to the selected eruptions. From Yr +1 to Yr +6 after the eruption,\nrespectively [(a)-(f)]. Black lines represent isopycnals.\n\nAt the same time, the cold anomaly of 0.35?C seems to spread to even deeper layers\n\n? 1000m, as also noted by Ding et al. (2014). In this section the anomalies, independent\n\nof their signal, respect the isopycnals distribution as in the 0W section. At Yr +5 (Figure\n\n3.20e) a positive anomaly smaller than 0.1?C is located at the subsurface between 100\n\nand 1000m depth.\n\n\n\nChapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 52\n\nAt Yr +6 (Figure 3.20f) the cold anomaly at the surface has been displaced southward\n\n(between 45-60S). Different from what is observed at 0W, in which the cold anomaly\n\nduring Yr +6 only spreads south up to 45S. Fact that agrees with Kim and Kim (2012)\n\nresults of the cold signature persistence around 50S. The difference in the anomaly\n\nspreading in each vertical section is probably related to the latitude where the isopycnals\n\nreach the surface. Although there are differences in both sections, the cold anomaly is\n\nstill meaningful at Yr +6 with values ranging 0.06-0.3?C. Thus, the subsurface recovery\n\ntime scale is longer, because of the absence of air-sea fluxes (Delworth et al., 2005). In\n\naddition, it may show a cumulative effect from near placed eruptions such as 1809 and\n\n1815.\n\nThe cold anomaly that penetrates the layers around 1000m is small ? 0.025?C, agree-\n\ning with Ding et al. (2014) that found 0-1000m negative temperature anomalies of roughly\n\n0.03K. Stenchikov et al. (2009) and Kim and Kim (2012) have observed smaller values of\n\n0.005?C. However, the signal in the deeper layers is better evaluated in averages of the\n\nOHC as in Church et al. (2005), because the changes are very small and hard to separate\n\nfrom internal variability. The cooling signal is detected even in layers deeper than 2000m\n\n(Stenchikov et al., 2009; Stenchikov, 2016). However, it is not yet meaningfully observed\n\nin this analysis, which is probably due to the short analysis period, considering that the\n\nspreading of the cold signal to the deeper ocean may take 15-20 years (Church et al.,\n\n2005; Stenchikov et al., 2009).\n\nMost of the literature focuses only in the temperature signal spreading into depth,\n\nhere the salinity anomaly is analyzed for the same sections (Figures 3.21 and 3.22). The\n\nsalinity behavior along depth is not as well defined as temperature, but it still respects\n\nthe isopycnal distribution. For the Greenwich Meridian section, at Yr +1 (Figure 3.21a)\n\na positive salinity anomaly (0.05) appears at the surface south of 40S approximately to\n\n100m depth. North of 40S there is a fresher anomaly (-0.03) from 15m to 150m depth.\n\n\n\n53 3.2. Last Millennium eruptions\n\nFigure 3.21: Greenwich Meridian (0W) section | Composite salinity response to the\nselected eruptions. From Yr +1 to Yr +6 after the eruption, respectively [(a)-(f)]. Black\nlines represent isopycnals.\n\nIn deeper layers 100-250m, following the 27.25 isopycnal, there is also a negative\n\nanomaly of 0.05, which seems to spread to even deeper layers and shift to the south in\n\nthe subsequent years (Figure 3.21a,b,c). At Yr +3 (FIgure 3.21c) the saltier anomaly\n\nis confined in the southernmost region reaching only ?200m depth. After this year the\n\npositive anomaly is much weaker (Figure 3.21d,e,f).\n\n\n\nChapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 54\n\nFor the Antarctic Peninsula section (Figure 3.22), a similar patter emerges. In the\n\nfirst year after the eruption (Figure 3.22a) a saltier anomaly is concentrated at the surface\n\n(?50m) south of 60S and the fresh anomaly is near the surface north of 40S, but with\n\nsmaller magnitude (?-0.01) and in deeper layers it extends to 60S.\n\nFigure 3.22: Antarctic Peninsula (54W) section | Composite salinity response to\nthe selected eruptions. From Yr +1 to Yr +6 after the eruption, respectively [(a)-(f)].\nBlack lines represent isopycnals.\n\n\n\n55 3.2. Last Millennium eruptions\n\nDuring the subsequent year (Figure 3.22) the saltier anomaly extends into deeper\n\nlayers ?1000m and keeps the same until Yr +6 (Figure 3.22f). The positive anomaly\n\nis no longer found at the surface layer at Yr +4 (Figure 3.22d) south of 60S. There is\n\nsmaller positive anomaly at the surface north of 60S, which has spread in Yr +6 (Figure\n\n3.22f). This is different from what is observed in the 0W section, that has a negative\n\nanomaly in this region for all composites years (Figure 3.21). At Yr +6 anomalies remain\n\nmeaningful, suggesting that salinity is probably perturbed for as long as temperature.\n\nBoth salinity sections show roughly a similar pattern of positive anomaly near the\n\nsurface and a negative anomaly in the deeper layers, mostly in the regions where isopycnals\n\nreach the surface ?45-60S and 50-65S for 0W and 54W, respectively. This may be\n\nexplained by increased convection, which moves fresher surface water down and saltier\n\nsubsurface water upwards (Kim and Kim, 2012). Even though the anomalies in the salinity\n\nand potential temperature vertical sections are significant, the isopycnal distribution does\n\nnot change between the composite years.\n\nHovm\u00f6ller\n\nTo better understand if and how the anomalies are spreading in the subsequent\n\ncomposite years, vertical Hovm\u00f6ller diagrams (Figure 3.24) for two different regions\n\n(Figure 3.23). The y-axis is the depth and the x-axis is the sequence of the composite\n\nyears from Yr -3 to the Yr +9. The dotted vertical line is the year of the eruption (Yr\n\n0).The oceanic region boundaries are 0-10E and 30-34S (Figure 3.24a,b) and the Antarctic\n\nPeninsula region is an average of 60-48W and 61-67S (Figure 3.24c,d). It should be taken\n\ninto account that the behavior is slightly different from the meridional sections, since this\n\nis an averaged area.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.

Last Millennium eruptions\n\nThese regions show opposite behavior after volcanic eruptions. The oceanic region\n\nshows a negative anomaly of -0.3?C in the following year after the eruption that is in\n\nthe layer between surface and 100m depth (Figure 3.24a). It starts to penetrate into the\n\ndeeper ocean in the second year after the eruption, showing values of -0.16?C spreading\n\nto ?500m. This anomaly decreases at the surface only after the fifth subsequent austral\n\nsummer, but on the deeper layers it remains ? ?0.16?C. In the layers deeper than 1000m\n\nthe anomaly is present, values of -0.06?C, but is not possible to say if it is related just to\n\nthe volcanic eruptions.\n\nOn the other hand, in the Antarctic Peninsula region (Figure 3.24c), after the eruption\n\nthere is a positive temperature anomaly between the surface and 100m. The 0.3?C\n\nanomaly spreads at the surface to the third subsequent austral summer. From Yr +4\n\nthe anomalies at the surface have faded, but in the layers deeper than 150m a positive\n\ntemperature anomaly of about 0.08?C is present.\n\nDeeper than 1000m there is a cold anomaly of -0.06?C starting somewhat at Yr +4\n\nthat gets weaker but extends to Yr +9. This could be related to the spreading of the\n\ncold anomaly present in other regions at the surface to deeper layers (i.e., north of 50S).\n\nThe cold anomaly in deeper layers may last several decades to centuries (Stenchikov\n\net al., 2009; McGregor et al., 2015; Pausata et al., 2015; Stenchikov, 2016), which is\n\nnot evaluated in the present analysis because there is a superposition of the eruptions\n\ncomposites, further analysis considering individual eruptions are required to verify and\n\nisolate the volcanic signal in the deeper layers at decadal and longer time-scales.\n\nThe salinity anomaly in the oceanic region (Figure 3.24b) is mostly negative, while at\n\nthe Antarctic Peninsula region it is positive (Figure 3.24d). In the oceanic region (Figure\n\n3.24b), there is a negative anomaly (? ?0.02), however it is difficult to separate from the\n\nbackground condition of the years before the eruption, that also have shown a negative\n\nanomaly of the same magnitude. The largest anomaly in this region occurs at Yr +3\n\nof about 0.05 and spreads to 200m depth. This anomaly is found in the deeper layers\n\n? 500m in Yr +5, but with smaller values.\n\nThe response in salinity to volcanism in the Antarctic Peninsula (Figure 3.24d) region\n\n\n\nChapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 58\n\nis a positive anomaly of 0.05 that starts in the first year after the eruption. This anomaly\n\nfrom the surface to 150m remains the same until Yr +3, after it gets weaker (0.02) and\n\nspread into deeper layers around 500m. Note that the positive potential temperature\n\nanomaly seems to follow the positive salinity anomaly in the Antarctic Peninsula region,\n\nwhich suggests that the salinity may control the sinking of this water. Therefore, even\n\nthough the positive potential temperature anomaly is not sufficiently dense to sink, it\n\nis forced to sink in the following years (i.e., Yr +3 to +4) because of the increased in\n\ndensity related to the saltier anomaly also present in the same region.\n\nAnother point to notice is the background condition, the years before the eruption\n\n(i.e., Yr -1 and -2), for each region its different, thus the background condition could play\n\nan important role (Zanchettin et al., 2013). In addition, in both regions the salinity and\n\ntemperature anomalies remain meaningful even at Yr +9, suggesting that the recovery\n\nfrom volcanic eruption could take at least a decade Church et al. (2005); Gleckler et al.\n\n(2006); Ding et al. (2014). At the same time, there is superposition of some events,\n\ntherefore, the Hovm\u00f6ller diagram after year +6 could be showing a cumulative signal\n\nfrom successive eruptions.\n\n3.2.3 Water Masses Analysis\n\nTo verify if any of the significant anomalies at the surface would be able to impact\n\nand modify water masses, the averaged Weddell Sea TS diagram is analyzed, shown in\n\nFigure 3.25. The WDW is well represented, even if it is slightly warmer, up to 1.5?C,\n\ncompared to Nicholls et al. (2009). The only changes that are observed in the composite\n\nyears occur in the first ?200m. This could be explained by the longer time scale necessary\n\nfor a change at the surface to penetrate into the ocean deeper layers (Church et al., 2005;\n\nGleckler et al., 2006). Even during Yr +9 it is not possible to see meaningful changes in\n\nlayers deeper than 500m in this TS diagram analysis.\n\nThe small changes are hard to differentiate from the climatological average (thick grey\n\nline), even in the zoom for the first 200m (Figure 3.25b). The Yr +2 (magenta line) shows\n\n\n\n59 3.2. Last Millennium eruptions\n\nlarger changes compared to the climatological average. Most of the difference is located\n\napproximately at 75m, showing a slightly increase in the salinity and temperature. This\n\nis related to the first response due to volcanic events (see Figure 3.16 and 3.22), since\n\nthe larger anomalies have been observed to spread all the way to 200m.\n\nFigure 3.25: TS diagram for the Weddell Sea | (a) Averaged Weddell Sea TS diagram\nfrom surface to 2000m. (b) Zoom for the first ?100m. Climotological mean for the LM\nis represented as the thick black line and different colors represent each composite year\nthat is described in the legend.\n\nEven at Yr +9 the TS diagram has not shown changes in the deeper layers, such\n\nas the WDW. Thus, the increase in some water production as the 10% increase in\n\nAABW production identified by Kim and Kim (2012), is probably not related to changes\n\nin precursors water masses of AABW formation or in these water masses thermohaline\n\ncharacteristics. Therefore, further analysis are needed to verify if volcanism would be\n\nable to imprint meaningful modifications in water masses hydrographic characteristics.\n\n3.2.4 Regional Analysis: Weddell Sea\n\nA special focus is given to the anomalous warming in the Weddell Sea related to\n\nvolcanic events, which has not been observed before. This section present results and\n\ndiscussion of a regional analysis in which the dynamical aspects of this anomalous feature\n\nis explained. Figure 3.26 depicts the same composite anomaly for SST and SSS at Yr +1,\n\nonly the significant regions at 90% are shown. The wind stress anomaly is superposed in\n\n\n\nChapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 60\n\nvectors.\n\nIt is expected that the aftermath of a volcanic event is an overall cooling of the surface\n\n(Church et al., 2005; Ding et al., 2014; Stenchikov, 2016). This cooling acts to offset the\n\nwarming of the PD (Delworth et al., 2005; Gleckler et al., 2006), the anomalous warming\n\nobserved here would imply in opposite impact, as it would increase the anthropogenic\n\nwarming. Together with the warming, there is a positive salinity anomaly almost at the\n\nsame region, but spread eastward. This anomalous positive salinity after the eruption\n\ncould be linked to an anomalous sea-ice expansion (i.e., increased brine rejection) that\n\nwas discussed by Zanchettin et al. (2014). The authors observed that the Antarctic sea-ice\n\ngoes through an initial expansion phase during integration of the first and second years,\n\nfollowed by a retraction after an eruption. The expansion phase would increase the sea\n\nsurface salinity through more brine rejection.\n\nFigure 3.26: Regional Weddell Sea composites | Composite response to the selected\neruptions only showing DJF Yr +1 for (a) SST [?C] and (b) SSS anomalies. Vectors show\nthe wind stress anomaly. It is only shown regions that are significant at 90% according\nto the WRS test.\n\nThe wind stress anomaly reveals an intensified westerly flow (represented by vectors\n\nin Figure 3.26), which is further explored in Figures 3.27 and 3.28. The meridional wind\n\nstress in the Weddell Sea climatological austral summer is a northward flow that inverts\n\nits direction in the northernmost portion of the Antarctic Peninsula (continuous line in\n\nFigure 3.27a). Due to volcanic eruption, the response in TAUY is a negative anomaly in\n\n\n\n61 3.2. Last Millennium eruptions\n\nthe northern Antarctic Peninsula (Figure 3.27b). This anomaly is sufficient to invert the\n\ncirculation in this region as shown in Figure 3.27c that is the sum of the climatological\n\nLM austral summer and the anomaly field during the year after the eruption (Yr +1).\n\nThe continuous line is the zero TAUY from the climatological austral summer and the\n\ndotted line is the zero TAUY impacted by volcanic explosion.\n\nFigure 3.27: Wind stress response at Yr +1 | The right-hand column is the LM\nclimatological mean, the central column the Yr +1 anomaly and the left-hand column\nthe sum of both for [(a),(b),(c)] TAUY [N m?2] and [(d),(e),(f)] TAUX [N m?2]. The\ncontinuous line represent the zero contour for LM climatological mean and the dotted\nline the zero contour resultant from the year after the eruption perturbation.\n\nAt the same time, the zonal wind stress also significantly changes, as can be seen in\n\nFigure 3.27c,d,e. In the following austral summer after the eruption TAUX southernmost\n\nextension, represented by the continuous line in Figure 3.27d, has dislocated southward\n\n(dotted line in Figure 3.27c). It is also observed that the zonal wind stress has intensified\n\nin ? 20% (0.03N m?2).\n\nThe southward migration of the prevailing westerlies is also shown in Figure 3.28, that\n\npresents the TAUX zonal average for the austral summer climatology (continuous black\n\nline), the composite Yr +1 (magenta line) and the composite Yr +8 (dotted blue line).\n\n\n\nChapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 62\n\nThe polar shift of the westerlies of almost 2? shown by the horizontal lines is clearly seen.\n\nThe horizontal lines in Figure 3.28 elucidates the associated maximum zonal wind stress\n\nposition3 of the LM austral summer climatology and averaged composite Yr +1.\n\nFigure 3.28: Zonal wind stress [N m?2] zonal average for the South Atlantic\nOcean | The black line is the LM climatological mean for DJF, the ensemble spread is\nrepresented by the dotted line, in magenta is the year after the eruption (Yr +1) and\nin green 8 years after the eruption (Yr +8). The vertical lines represent the associated\nmaximum zonal wind stress position for the climatology (black line) and Yr +1 (magenta\nline).\n\nWesterlies southward shift after the eruption have been observed before (Stenchikov\n\net al., 2009; Karpechko et al., 2010) in different simulations. Schneider et al. (2009) rather\n\nthan a poleward shift, discuss an equatorward shift of the westerlies in post-eruption\n\nscenario in the CCSM3. McGraw et al. (2016), on the other hand, using the CESM\n\nLarge Ensemble experiment (LENS) suggest that the westerlies southward shift is in fact\n\na response after eruptions, however they discuss that the internal variability overwhelm\n\nthis change.\n\nThe differences between the northern Antarctic Peninsula (60-48W and 61-67S) and\n\nan oceanic region (12-26E and 53-59S) is explored. The specific regions are shown in\n\nFigure 3.29a. A standardized SEA comparing SST, SSS and TAUX composite evolution\n3The associated maximum zonal wind stress position is calculated from the weighted averaged method.\n\n\n\n63 3.2. Last Millennium eruptions\n\nfor both regions is shown in Figure 3.29b,c.\n\nFigure 3.29: Superposed Epoch Analysis | (a) Bathymetry map for the Southern\nOcean Atlantic sector showing the location of selected regions for SEA. (b) Antarctic\nPeninsula region averaged between 60-48W and 61-67S and (c) oceanic region averaged\nbetween 12-26E and 53-59S. In [(a), (b)] the vertical continuous line marks the year of\nthe eruption (Yr 0) and the dotted line the first year after the eruption (Yr +1).\n\nAll air-sea properties show changes of the same magnitude in the first austral summer\n\nafter the eruption (Yr +1 vertical dotted line in Figure 3.29a,b). Immediately in the\n\nsubsequent year the anomalies start to decay and by the Yr +5 get back to magnitude\n\ncomparable to the year before the eruption (Yr -1). Changes after the eruption are of 1.5\n\nstandard deviation in both regions, but with different signals. The northern Antarctic\n\nPeninsula shows positive anomaly for all properties, contrasting with the oceanic region\n\nthat presents negative SST and SSS anomaly and positive TAUX anomaly. Despite the\n\nsame wind response after the eruption, the oceanic properties respond differently.\n\nSST perturbation observed in the oceanic region is the expected cooling response due\n\nto the radiative effect of volcanic eruptions (Robock, 2000; Church et al., 2005; Ding\n\net al., 2014; Pausata et al., 2015; Stenchikov, 2016). Instead the surface warming near\n\nthe Antarctic Peninsula in the Weddell Sea may be controlled by changes at the surface\n\nwinds. The significant wind stress field change immediately impact the ocean surface\n\nvelocity (Figure 3.30).\n\n\n\nChapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 64\n\nFigure 3.30: Surface ocean velocities | (a) Surface ocean velocity DJF climatological\nmean for the LM, the background is the magnitude [cm s?1], the white vector represent\nthe direction, the black arrows represent the Weddell Gyre circulation and the grey arrows\nthe southern extension of the ACC.

Last Millennium eruptions\n\nThe austral summer climatological velocity at the surface is shown in Figure 3.30a,\n\nthe thick grey arrows represent the southern extent of the ACC that is stronger than\n\nthe surface Weddell Gyre represented in black thin arrows. Each velocity component is\n\nrepresented in Figure 3.30b,c, and the anomalies due to volcanic explosion at Yr +1 are\n\ndepicted in Figure 3.30d,e. The UVEL and VVEL surface anomalies represent a 10%\n\nto ? 14% increase in the flow, respectively, mainly in the southern extent of the ACC\n\n(Figure 3.30a), which agrees with Kim and Kim (2012). While, somehow the Weddell\n\nGyre is a bit weaker, decrease of ? 8% in its zonal component in the eastern domain near\n\nthe Antarctic continent. The VVEL near the Antarctic Peninsula after the eruption is\n\nhighly influenced by the ACC southern extension flux.\n\nThe stronger ACC southern extent is enhancing mixing in the northern Antarctic\n\nPeninsula region. There is not any warmer water at the surface coming to the Weddell\n\nregion. Thus, the positive temperature anomaly from Figure 3.26a is probably explained\n\nby deeper layer circulation. To explore this, the typical SR4 WOCE transect4 (Figure\n\n3.6a) that covers both the inflow and outflow regions of the Weddell Gyre is examined.\n\nTemperature anomaly shows (Figure 3.31a) small increase of 0.08?C in the inflow\n\nregion, deeper than 200m. In the northern hemisphere, Zhong et al. (2011) observe a\n\nsubsurface warming after sequenced eruptions which is attributed to weakened convection,\n\na similar mechanism may explain the subsurface heating of this region. At the same time,\n\nin the outflow region the positive anomaly is concentrated in layers shallower than 100m,\n\nwhich suggests that the water getting in the Weddell Gyre subsurface is slightly warmer,\n\nbut the water that is at the subsurface outflow is not. This is probably related to the\n\nobserved changes at the subsurface circulation in the Weddell Sea (Figure 3.31b).\n\nFigure 3.31b shows the VVEL anomaly along the depth for the first year after the\n\neruption. During Yr +1, there is a negative anomaly in the subsurface outflow region\n\nof ? 0.12cm s?1 that reaches 400m deep. At the same time, at the surface and easterly\n\ndislocated a positive anomaly of the same magnitude. This shows that the outflow\n4The closest model grid points from the original stations in SR4 WOCE transect have been selected\n\nto this analysis.\n\n\n\nChapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 66\n\nvelocity has decreased in the original position in 16%. The anomalous positive VVEL\n\nin the surface is related to the increased southward ACC extension showed in Figure\n\n3.30d,e.\n\nFigure 3.31: WOCE SR4 transect | Composite response to the selected eruptions\nduring the first year after the eruption (yr +1) for (a) potential temperature anomaly\n[?C] and (b) VVEL anomaly [cm s?1]. The inflow and outflow regions are marked,\nrespectively 71.5S,11W and 63.5S,53W.\n\nTherefore, the anomalous warm surface responds more strongly not to the radiative\n\nforcing, but to changes in the ocean dynamics in the first austral summer after the\n\neruption (Yr +1):\n\n1. Winds: Along the outflow region in the Weddell Sea, the northward winds are\n\npushed southwards with the southward (negative) anomalies north of the Antarctic\n\nPeninsula extending west. At the same time, the westerlies are stronger and shift\n\nsouth into most of the Weddell Sea.\n\n2. Surface Circulation: As a response to the wind changes, the ACC southern extension\n\nis stronger, enhancing mixing at the surface outflow region. Therefore, the Weddell\n\n\n\n67 3.2. Last Millennium eruptions\n\nGyre outflow region is more influenced by the ACC southern extension.\n\n3. Subsurface Circulation: At the subsurface layer, ? 600m depth, the Weddell Gyre\n\noutflow is weakened and the inflow region is somehow warmer (0.08?C). This means\n\nthat some of the subsurface water that is supposed to be exported out of the Weddell\n\nGyre has been trapped in the region near the Antarctic Peninsula.\n\n4. This scenario of enhanced mixing and the warmer subsurface water accumulated\n\nin the outflow region is bringing up warmer and saltier subsurface waters (i.e.,\n\nWDW). This waters get trapped at the surface outflow region because of the\n\nreversed meridional wind anomalies and the southward shifted westerlies.\n\nThe schematics on Figure 3.32 represent in summary the suggested mechanism.\n\nFigure 3.32: Schematics from the suggested mechanism in the Weddell Sea\nnear the Antarctic Peninsula | The surface and vertical section in the SR4 transect\nrepresent the temperature anomaly for the year after the eruption (Yr +1). The wind\ncirculation is represented (yellow and blue arrows), the inflow and outflow of the Weddell\nGyre in green and blue, respectively.\n\n\n\nChapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 68\n\nThe idea is that the positive SST anomaly resulting from volcanic eruptions, observed\n\nat the northern part of the Antarctic Peninsula is a result of the Weddell Sea ocean\n\ndynamics. It is explained by the Weddell Gyre response to the southward shift and\n\nstrengthening of the westerlies together with the southward wind anomalies at the outflow\n\nregion. At this region, warm and salty WDW waters, through convective mixing, reaches\n\nsurface layers. Because of the anomalous wind, the outflow is stifled leading to the\n\npositive SST anomaly detected.\n\n3.3 Modern Eruption: Mt. Pinatubo\n\nTo test if the model results have an impact on the real world, the ocean response to\n\nMt. Pinatubo eruption in 1991 is investigated using observations and ocean reanalysis\n\n(ERSSTv5 and SODA, respectively). The fact that this eruption was considerably smaller\n\nthan the LM eruptions and that the ocean response is also a result of increased post\n\nindustrial GHG and ozone depletion forcing is being considered.\n\nIf the anomalous warming after an eruption is observed in the PD, the volcanic forcing\n\ncould actually enhance the warming response associated with anthropogenic forcing at\n\nthe Weddell Sea and Antarctic Peninsula. The SST spatial pattern evolution for the Mt.\n\nPinatubo eruption from the CESM-LME, ERSSTv5 observed product and SODA ocean\n\nreanalysis are shown in Figure 3.33.\n\n\n\n69 3.3. Modern Eruption: Mt. Pinatubo\n\nFigure 3.33: SST [?C] response to Mt. Pinatubo eruption | Left-hand column for\nCESM-LME [(a), (d), (g), (j)], central column for ERSSTv5 [(b), (e), (h), (k)] and\nright-hand column for SODA [(c), (f), (i), (l)]. Each line represent different years from\n1991 (Yr 0, the eruption year) to 1994 (Yr +3).\n\nMt. Pinatubo explosion response in CESM-LME shows signals during the year of the\n\neruption (Yr 0, 1991 Figure 3.33a). In this year a positive temperature anomaly of 0.8?C\n\nis present in the Weddell Sea and between 54S and 66S there is a cold anomaly of on\n\naverage 0.6?C. North of 54S there is a positive temperature anomaly that is probably\n\nnot related to the volcanic eruption. In the first austral summer after the eruption (1992,\n\n\n\nChapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 70\n\nFigure 3.33d) the same pattern is present and in the second year (1993, Figure 3.33g) it\n\nstarts to fade, the warm surface anomaly in the Antarctic Peninsula is of 0.4?C. The Yr\n\n+3 (1994, Figure 3.33j) shows a cold anomaly in the Weddell Sea and a positive anomaly\n\nin the northern portion of the region.\n\nResults from ERSSTv5 for the year of eruption (1991, Figure 3.33b) show positive\n\nanomalies, mostly west of 40W, which are probably related to the anthropogenic effect.\n\nMt. Pinatubo cooling effect starts in the first year after the eruption (Yr +1, 1992\n\nFigure 3.33e), in this same year a small region next to the Antarctic Peninsula has\n\nwarmed. This warming is larger at Yr +2 (1993, Figure 3.33h) reaching 0.8?C, but is\n\naccompanied by a large warming of the same magnitude at the Drake Passage. During\n\nYr +3 (1994, Figure 3.33k) the anomaly at the Drake Passage disappears, however the\n\npositive temperature anomaly in the Weddell Sea is still present. Finally, shown in Figure\n\n3.33 right-hand column, results from SODA depict overall similar anomalies pattern,\n\nalbeit larger values with a maximum SST anomaly of 2?C. During the eruption year\n\n(1991, Figure 3.33c) SODA shows a similar pattern to ERSSTv5. The warm surface\n\nanomaly near the Antarctic Peninsula only appears in the second subsequent austral\n\nsummer (Yr +2, 1993 Figure 3.33i) reaching values of 1.5?C. At Yr +3 (1994, Figure\n\n3.33l) the Weddell Sea anomaly is smaller.\n\nAll data sets compared here have shown the expected cooling pattern, the magnitude is\n\nlarger than other studies, which may be related to the study region. For example, Church\n\net al. (2005) have shown model results of 0.4? negative anomaly, while observations are\n\nof the order of ? 0.3?C. Also for model simulations, a cooling of 0.25?C is observed in\n\nMignot et al. (2011) and Kim and Kim (2012). Furthermore, Ding et al. (2014) have\n\nobserved in CMIP5 a global average cooling of 0.3?C. CESM-LME and ERSSTv5 agree\n\nmore closely to previous studies than the results from SODA, which may be linked to\n\nthe SODA higher spatial resolution.\n\nDifferences between each year and a background reference field (Yr -1, 1990) are also\n\nshown in Figure 3.34. During Mt. Pinatubo eruption the background conditions are\n\nhighly influenced by anthropogenically forcings (Gleckler et al., 2006; Zanchettin et al.,\n\n\n\n71 3.3. Modern Eruption: Mt. Pinatubo\n\n2013), therefore the background condition may influence even more than during the LM.\n\nFigure 3.34: SST [?C] differences relative to the year before the Mt. Pinatubo\neruption (1991) | Left-hand column for CESM-LME [(a), (d), (g), (j)], central column\nfor ERSSTv5 [(b), (e), (h), (k)] and right-hand column for SODA [(c), (f), (i), (l)].\nEach line represent different years from 1991 (Yr 0, the eruption year) to 1994 (Yr +3).\n\nConsidering the difference between Yr -1 (1990) and all other years in the CESM-LME\n\n(Figure 3.34 left-hand column) it is evident that the only region that has warmed after\n\nMt. Pinatubo eruption is the Weddell Sea. Except for a small region in the northeast\n\ndomain that shows warming in 1994. The positive temperature anomaly is present in\n\n\n\nChapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 72\n\nthis results from 1991 to 1993, with difference of 0.9?C from the background.\n\nThe ERSSTv5 (Figure 3.34 central column) shows warming compared to the year\n\nbefore Mt. Pinatubo eruption in the northeast domain in the year of the eruption (1991)\n\nand during the first year after the eruption (1992). However, in Yr +2 (1993, Figure\n\n3.34h) there is a 0.9?C warming in the Weddell Sea. The difference between the Yr -1\n\n(1990) and all other years for SODA (Figure 3.34 right-hand column) shows the same\n\nwarming in the northeast domain during the year of the eruption. The warming pattern\n\nin the Weddell Sea starts at Yr +1 (1992, Figure 3.34f) and is still present at Yr +2 (1993,\n\nFigure 3.34i). At Yr +2 the difference in relation to the year before the eruption (1990)\n\nreaches 0.9?C and is spread out in the Weddell Sea. Most of the domain shows a cooling\n\npattern, except some regions, such as between 60-72S and 30-10W, that shows positive\n\ndifference relative to 1990.\n\nAs discussed in Section 3.2.4 the time series for two contrasting regions are shown for\n\nSST in Figure 3.35. In the Antarctic Peninsula region (Figure 3.35a) the larger signal\n\nafter the eruption occurs in the second subsequent year (Yr +2, 1993). This signal is a\n\npositive anomaly, which differs in magnitude between the data sets. As seen in Figure\n\n3.33 right-hand column SODA shows larger anomalies, but all data sets have warmed\n\nafter Mt. Pinatubo eruption in this region. During 1991 austral summer the anomaly is\n\nalmost zero for ERSSTv5 and CESM-LME, but in the SODA results there is a negative\n\nanomaly of 0.5?C.\n\nOn the other hand, the oceanic region (Figure 3.35b) contrasts with the Antarctic\n\nPeninsula, where during Yr +2 (1993) all data sets show zero anomaly. The larger\n\nresponse occurs in the year of the eruption (1991), but the data sets diverge. SODA\n\nshows a positive anomaly of 0.5?C, while CESM-LME shows a negative anomaly of the\n\nsame magnitude.\n\n\n\n73 3.3. Modern Eruption: Mt. Pinatubo\n\nFigure 3.35: SST [?C] anomaly time series | (a) Antarctic Peninsula region and (b)\noceanic region, the same regions as Figure 3.29. The different data sets are represented\nin colors as described in the legend. The continuous vertical line mark the eruption year\n(Yr 0, 1991) and the dotted vertical line the second year after the eruption (Yr +2, 1993).\n\nEven though it is difficult to separate the volcanic signal from other forcings in the\n\nPD (Church et al., 2005), the warming signal in the Weddell Sea is detected in all data\n\nsets at Yr +2. The fact that the volcanic triggered warming happens only at Yr +2\n\nin the observations may be explained by the background conditions. Zanchettin et al.\n\n(2013) discuss that the existence of multiple response pathways is possible depending\n\non the background condition, therefore the already existing warming may have delayed\n\nthe oceanic response in the Weddell Sea. Another important point worth emphasizing is\n\nthat Mt. Pinatubo eruption is much shorter lived compared to LM eruptions because, as\n\nmentioned in Gleckler et al. (2006), it occurred relative to a ongoing anthropogenically\n\nforced ocean warming.\n\nFinally, to verify if the wind stress displays the same changes as in the LM results,\n\nthe zonal and meridional wind stress are analyzed (Figures 3.36 and 3.37). The similarity\n\nof these changes with the composite ones are important, since TAUX and TAUY have\n\nbeen considered the trigger to the positive anomaly anomaly generated after the LM\n\neruptions. Results from Mt. Pinatubo SODA and CESM-LME reveal similar results\n\n(Figure 3.36a,b respectively). The prevailing westerlies have increased in magnitude and\n\nalso shifted southward as observed in the LM (Karpechko et al., 2010; Zanchettin et al.,\n\n\n\nChapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 74\n\n2014; Stenchikov, 2016).\n\nFigure 3.36: Zonal wind stress [N m?2] zonal average for the South Atlantic\nOcean | (a) CESM-LME and (b) SODA. The dotted line is the climatological DJF\nmean for the period of 1980-2005. The vertical lines represent the associated maximum\nzonal wind stress position for the climatology (black line) and Yr +1 (magenta line).\n\nOverall, the SODA zonal wind stress is smaller in magnitude than CESM-LME (0.15N\n\nm?2 and 0.175N m?2 maximum respectively). Figure 3.36 shows the zonal average of\n\nTAUX for CESM-LME and SODA, the black dotted line is the austral summer climatology\n\nfor the period 1980-2005. The first year after the eruption (Yr +1, 1992) shows the\n\nprevailing westerlies southward drift for both data sets, in CESM-LME of ? 1? and\n\nSODA ? 2? represented by the horizontal lines in Figure 3.36. Although in SODA during\n\nthe eruption year (1991) TAUX has shown larger maximum, there is no southward drift.\n\nIn both cases the zonal wind stress has become smaller than the climatology in 1993 (Yr\n\n+2) austral summer.\n\nThe largest TAUY response to Mt. Pinatubo eruption has been during the first\n\naustral summer after the eruption (1992), as seen in Figure 3.37.\n\n\n\n75 3.3. Modern Eruption: Mt. Pinatubo\n\nFigure 3.37: Meridional wind estress response at yr +1 | The right-hand column\nis 1980-2005 TAUY [N m?2] climatological mean, in the central column the Yr +1 (1992)\nanomaly and the left-hand column the sum of both for [(a), (b), (c)] CESM-LME and\n[(d), (e), (f)] SODA. The continuous line represent the zero contour of the climatological\nmean and the dotted line the zero contour resultant from the year after Mt. Pinatubo\neruption (1992).\n\nHowever, in the northern Antarctic Peninsula region the anomalies are not enough to\n\nchange the circulation, as observed in the LM. That is probably because the climatological\n\nTAUY zero contour in the modern period is already placed in the Weddell Sea. This\n\nsupports the idea that the westerlies southward drift may be enough to trigger the surface\n\nwarm anomaly in the Weddell Sea post-eruption scenario.\n\nExtracting the volcanic signal from observations, such as SODA and ERSSTv5, is dif-\n\nficult given the relatively short-lived forcing (Meronen et al., 2012) and the anthropogeni-\n\ncally forced background (Gleckler et al., 2006; Zanchettin et al., 2013). Mt. Pinatubo\n\nSST at Yr +2 after eruption scenario response near the Antarctic Peninsula may be\n\nwarming, rather than the expected cooling that would act as offset of the anthropogenic\n\nwarming (Delworth et al., 2005; Gleckler et al., 2006). Moreover, surface warming driven\n\nat least partially by the southward shift of the westerlies at Yr +1 may have potential\n\nimpacts for recent sea-ice production and melt.\n\n\n\n4 CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe response of the South Atlantic Ocean, including the Weddell Sea, to volcanic\n\neruptions was evaluated using simulation results from the Last Millennium Ensemble\n\nexperiment of the Community Earth System Model (CESM-LME). Despite the uncer-\n\ntainties related to complex earth system models (Zanchettin et al., 2017), the use of 15\n\nensembles and 7 eruptions (a total of 105 events) allowed a solid description of air-sea ma-\n\njor impacts and to separate the forced climate response from internal variability (Fasullo\n\net al., 2017). In this sense, this study emphasize the importance of ensemble experiments\n\nto reproduce the internal dynamics of the coupled climate system for interpretation of\n\nsimulated regional past climates (Zanchettin et al., 2012).\n\nVolcanism is the cause of great non-anthropogenic perturbations on the Earth climate\n\nthrough energy imbalance changes. Air-sea properties showed evident and significant (at\n\n90% level) response to the volcanic forcing in the first austral summer after the eruption\n\n(Yr +1), the surface presented an overall cooling, on average 0.6-0.8?C, located at specific\n\nlatitudes (i.e., 30S and 65S), which is robust given the small ensemble spread in the time\n\nseries. Results also showed SSS general increase of 0.06 between 40-50S, that was above\n\nthe internal variability. In the zonal wind stress composite a positive anomaly in 60S\n\n(0.02N m?2) was identified, accompanied by negative anomaly of the same magnitude\n\nat 45S. While the meridional wind stress field depicted a negative anomaly of 0.006N\n\nm?2 located near the Antarctic Peninsula, and a great positive anomaly in 45S of 0.01N\n\nm?2. Surface properties had different recovery periods, TAUX and TAUY were close to\n\nthe background condition of Yr -1, generally at Yr +3. However, SST and SSS was still\n\nsignificant at least up to Yr +5. Moreover, different relaxation periods were observed\n\ndependent on the latitude, both at the surface and at depth, suggesting that higher\n\nlatitudes may recover faster for SST and SSS anomalies.\n\n\n\n77\n\nIn this context, composite analysis also pointed to different regional signals, such\n\nas the positive temperature anomaly (0.8?C) accompanied by positive salinity anomaly\n\n(? 0.16) developed near the Antarctic Peninsula in the Weddell Sea.\n\nThe present analysis suggested that the anomalous warm ocean surface responds\n\nmore strongly to changes in the ocean dynamics, rather than to the radiative forcing (i.e.,\n\nexpected cooling), as consequence of the volcanic forcing. During the first austral summer\n\nafter the eruption (Yr +1), a strengthening of 0.03N m?2 of the prevailing westerlies was\n\nobserved, which was accompanied by a southward shift of ? 2?. At the same time, the\n\nwind circulation over the Weddell Sea became confined, which led to total inversion of\n\nthe meridional component of the wind stress near the northern Antarctic Peninsula. The\n\nmeridional wind changed from a northward to a southward circulation near the Antarctic\n\nPeninsula northernmost extension. As a response to the wind changes, the ACC southern\n\nextent increased in about 10%, enhancing mixing in the northern Antarctic Peninsula in\n\nthe Weddell Sea. In addition, around ? 600? depth, the Weddell Gyre outflow weakened\n\nin ? 16%, at the same time that the inflow region warmed (0.08?C). Thus, some of\n\nthe water that was supposed to be exported out of the Weddell Gyre is trapped in the\n\nsubsurface region near the Antarctic Peninsula in the Weddell Sea.\n\nThus, changes in the meridional wind stress in the northern Antarctic Peninsula,\n\naccumulated warmer subsurface water in the Weddell Sea outflow region and the enhanced\n\nmixing near the Antarctic Peninsula, favors the formation of the detected positive SST\n\nanomaly. It was suggested that the subsurface water, such as the WDW that is warmer\n\nand saltier than the surface water, is brought up to the surface by the enhanced mixing.\n\nBecause of the anomalous wind this water get trapped in the Weddell Sea surface outflow\n\nregion. Thus, a warmer and saltier anomaly is formed after the eruption. In addition,\n\nsea-ice may increase its extension after an eruption (Zanchettin et al., 2014), which would\n\ncontribute to increase the local salinity due to enhanced brine rejection.\n\nThe present study also evaluated the volcanic induced changes with depth. It was\n\nobserved that the positive temperature anomaly of 0.3?C near the Antarctic Peninsula\n\nextends down to ? 100m at Yr +1, then forced to sink at Yr +3 to +4, because of\n\n\n\nChapter 4. CONCLUSIONS 78\n\nthe increased salinity, that results in denser waters. The sinking of this water would\n\nonly happen after the wind forcing has faded at Yr +2, suggesting that the change in\n\nthe prevailing westerlies is the trigger for the anomalous warming near the Antarctic\n\nPeninsula after the eruption. At the same time, further north (?45S), the cold anomaly\n\n(0.4?C) spreads down to 500-1000m from Yr +2 and still meaningful at Yr +6. Despite\n\nthe interface of some volcanic events, it was suggested that the recovery from the volcanic\n\neruption at depth could take at least a decade.\n\nThe 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo was one of the strongest volcanic eruptions of\n\nthe 20?? century and this well observed eruption served as an important case study to\n\nunderstand and verify mechanisms that were identified as consequence of LM eruptions.\n\nEven though the volcanic signal is difficult to separate from the other forcings in the\n\nPD, the anomalous surface warming in the Antarctic Peninsula after the eruption was\n\nobserved at Yr +2 (1993). It was in agreement for all data sets, with SODA presenting\n\ngreater SST response of ?1-2?C than CESM-LME and ERSSTv5. The latter two showed\n\nwarming of 0.8?C. The delayed response compared to the LM eruptions was probably\n\nrelate to the PD background conditions, which accounts for an already exiting warming.\n\nThis result is also supported by the zonal wind stress increase at Yr +1 (1992). In\n\naddition and more important, the prevailing westerlies have shifted south. The meridional\n\nwind stress did not show reversion of direction in the northern Antarctic Peninsula,\n\nbecause the climatological (1980-2005) meridional wind stress zero contour was already\n\ndisplaced south. Fact that supports the idea that the westerlies southward drift triggers\n\nthe SST positive anomaly formation in the northern Antarctic Peninsula in the Weddell\n\nSea. Therefore, the present analysis suggested that the Mt. Pinatubo and LM eruptions\n\ninvolve similar mechanisms, although there is a delayed SST response.\n\nIn this sense, the post-eruption aftermath in a regional context such as for the northern\n\nAntarctic Peninsula in the Weddell Sea may not act as an offset of the anthropogenic\n\nwarming as suggested in Delworth et al. (2005) and Gleckler et al. (2006). Moreover,\n\nsurface warming after an eruption may have potential impacts for recent sea-ice production\n\nand melt, given the high sea-ice sensitivity to the stability of the seawater column, wind\n\n\n\n79\n\nand ocean currents (Zhong et al., 2011).\n\nAnother interesting aspect that has been recently studied by Fasullo et al. (2017) is the\n\npotential climate implications of future eruptions. The authors showed that in a global\n\nwarming scenario, the surface climate response to the eruption is amplified. Authors\n\nemphasized that even an amplified cooling remains much less than the associated warming\n\nof the anthropogenic forcing. Therefore, an eruption response such as the warming near\n\nAntarctic Peninsula in the Weddell Sea shown in the present analysis, would be a potential\n\namplifying factor for the ongoing global warming. How the warming observed in the LM\n\nand Mt. Pinatubo would respond to increased background warming should be under\n\nfurther investigation. Finally, the use of isotopes in complex climate models (Colose et al.,\n\n2016) to better understand the consequences of the volcanic forcing could be key approach\n\nto verify the robustness of the already suggested mechanism. Therefore, continuing to\n\nstudy the dynamical response mechanisms of great volcanic eruptions (e.g., Fasullo et al.,\n\n2017), validating the climate models with observations, proxy data (e.g., Stevenson et al.,\n\n2016), reanalysis data sets, and other new resources as isotopes, remains an useful exercise\n\nfor improving the understanding of climate variability in longer time scales.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAbram, N.
