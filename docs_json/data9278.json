To assess the migration, the position of the endoprosthesis \nregarding a certain anatomic region is verified. Considering the aneurysm of the infrarenal abdominal aorta, the proximal area of reference is the origin \nof the lowest renal artery and, at the distal region, it is located next to the internal iliac arteries. Patients should be monitored for long periods so that \nmigrations can be identified; these migrations usually occur 2 years after the implantation. To avoid migrations, mechanical forces that enable fixation \nand that are determined by the characteristics of the devices and by the incorporation of the endoprosthesis should predominate over gravitational \nand hemodynamic forces, which tend to drag the prosthesis toward to caudal direction. Angulation, extension, and diameter of the neck, and \ntransversal measure of the aneurysmatic sac are important morphological aspects related to migration. In relation to the technique, endoprosthesis \nimplantation with excessive oversizing (> 30%) is not recommended because it leads to aortic neck dilatation, folds and proximal leakage that also \ncontribute to migration. On the other hand, endoprosthesis with additional fixation devices (hooks, barbs and suprarenal fixation) seem to be less \nassociated with migration. The process of endoprosthesis incorporation is partial and does not seem to be enough to prevent later migrations. In this \nsense, experimental studies with endoprosthesis of higher porosity, as well as the use of substances that allow higher fibroplasia and adherence of the \nprosthesis to the artery, have been conducted and are promising. Such aspects are discussed in the present review of the literature.\n\nKeywords: Vascular prosthesis, migration, complications, aortic aneurysm.\n\nResumo\n\nA migra\u00e7\u00e3o da endopr\u00f3tese \u00e9 complica\u00e7\u00e3o do tratamento endovascular definida como deslocamento da ancoragem inicial.

Development of this tre-\natment modality was one of the finest achievements of vascu-\nlar surgery, as it allowed modification of the natural history \nof the disease and reduction of rupture-associated mortality.1 \nEndovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAR)2 \nis based on insertion of an endoprosthetic device through the \nfemoral or iliac artery. The device is then deployed within \nthe lumen of the aorta so its ends are anchored to normal \nartery, proximally and distally to the aneurysm. After the \nsheath is released, the elasticity of the stent graft provides ra-\ndial strength, which keeps the device fixated to the aneurysm \nneck. The endoluminally deployed stent thus excludes the \naneurysmal sac from circulation. Some stents have hooks or \nbarbs to improve fixation to the arterial wall.\n\nEVAR is associated with decreased transfusion require-\nments and avoids aortic cross-clamping, decreasing cardiac \noverload and the untoward effects of ischemia and reper-\nfusion, all of which contributes to allow shorter postope-\nrative recovery times.3,4. However, long-term follow-up of \npatients undergoing EVAR shows a permanent risk of graft \nmigration and structural failure, even when treatment was \nsuccessful. Close surveillance is therefore required to detect \nany relevant changes and, sometimes, establish the need for \nreintervention.5-9 On the other hand, despite the need for \ncontinuous postoperative monitoring, EVAR carries the \nbenefit of lower rupture-related death rates than with no \ntreatment.10\n\nSince the introduction of  EVAR, expectations on \nshort-, medium- and long-term outcomes has run high. \nTen years and countless studies on, the ideal endoprosthe-\ntic device has yet to be developed. Despite progress in graft \nmaterials, endoprosthesis migration is still a major issue, as \nit may lead to type I endoleak and increased pressure wi-\nthin the aneurysm, culminating in rupture or collapse of \nthe device into the aneurysmal sac, both of which indicate \nemergent open repair.5,11\n\nThe present article will discuss the clinical and patho-\nphysiological factors involved in endograft migration. \n\nDefinition and criteria\n\nEndoprosthesis migration is defined as displace-\nment of the device from its original site of attachment. \n\nAssessment of migration consists of determining the \nposition of the endoprosthesis relative to a predefined \nanatomical landmark. In infrarenal AAAs, the proximal \nlandmark is the origin of the lowest renal artery, and the \ndistal landmark is located next to the internal iliac arte-\nries. The landmark for suprarenal fixation is the superior \nmesenteric artery (SMA). CT scanning is the imaging \nmodality of choice for assessment of adequate placement \nor migration. Slices no larger than 3 mm should be ob-\ntained from the level of the SMA down to the common \nfemoral arteries. The use of other anatomical landmarks, \nsuch as position of the vertebral bodies as observed on \nCT itself or on abdominal plain films, is unreliable, as \nany vertebral size changes due to osteoporosis or other \nbone conditions may lead to erroneous assessment of \nmigration.12\n\nThe Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) defines endo-\ngraft migration as any displacement of 10 mm or more.13 \nCaudal migration of the proximal stent is most common \nand poses the greatest risk in EVAR. The SVS definition is \nproblematic in that, when the neck is small, 10 mm will cor-\nrespond nearly to its maximum length, and diagnosis may \nonly occur after the patient develops complications. In light \nof these considerations, current practice is to regard any \nmigration >5 mm as clinically relevant.14\n\nRegardless of endoprosthesis type, most migrations oc-\ncur after the 13th month post-implantation, peaking at 19 \nmonths.14-16 One key finding is that the risk of migration \npersists indefinitely after EVAR; complications have been \nreported as late as 4 years post-treatment. Follow-up studies \nseeking to assess graft migration must therefore extend for \nno less than 24 months after the procedure.\n\nAlthough follow-up and observation for graft migration \nare essential, the absence of migration is no guarantee of treat-\nment success. In some cases, perigraft leak may occur despite \nadequate proximal fixation of the endoprosthesis, leading to \nexpansion of the aneurysm. Therefore, proper device positio-\nning may only be interpreted as a positive treatment outcome \nif there are no perigraft leaks at the neck of the aneurysm.17-19\n\nCurrent recommendations provide for CT follow-up at \n1 month and 6 months post-procedure and annually there-\nafter. If migration is present, follow-up intervals are shorte-\nned for closer surveillance.20 In some cases, arteriography \n(which allows endovascular repair if necessary) is indicated.\n\nImportance of implantation technique\n\nImplantation of the endograft body more distally than \noriginally intended may be caused by erroneous operator \n\n\n\nMigration of endoprosthesis - Almeida MJ et al. J Vasc Bras 2010, Vol. 9, N\u00ba 2 63\n\nassessment due to parallax error, which is common in the \ntortuous aortic neck. Oblique views can minimize this issue \nand allow more accurate deployment.\n\nZarins et al.21 assessed the importance of proper \nplacement of the AneuRx stent graft at the origin of the \nrenal artery. Isolated review of this factor showed that \ngraft deployment below the intended site was directly \ncorrelated with greater risk of migration. The authors \nestablished that the greater the distance from the renal \nartery to the proximal end of the graft, the greater the \nrisk of migration; each millimeter increase in distance \nbelow the renal arteries increased risk of migration by \n5.8%. Likewise, each millimeter increase in length of the \ninfrarenal neck covered by the graft decreased migration \nrisk by 2.5%. Adequate placement of the distal end of the \ngraft near the origin of the internal iliac arteries also cor-\nrelates with a lower incidence of migration, as it reduces \nthe risk of distal leakage and allows better longitudinal \ncolumnar support for the endograft, which tends to pre-\nvent proximal migration.14\n\nClose attention to proper endograft placement at the \nproximal and distal neck of the aneurysm is therefore of the \nessence, as correct placement is positively correlated with \nlower risk of migration-related complications.\n\nBiomechanical forces interacting with the device\n\nBiomechanical forces produced by oversizing, the \ncontact area between the device and the artery, and addi-\ntional fixation such as hooks, barbs, or bare-metal supra-\nrenal support extensions encourage fixation of the device \nto the aorta, as does the inflammatory process that oc-\ncurs in the arterial wall.22 Conversely, gravitational pull \nand hemodynamics tend to drag the device caudally. The \nbalance of these forces determines whether migration \nwill occur. Complex calculations performed both in vi-\ntro (in the biomechanics lab setting)23 and in vivo, with \ncomputational analysis of the CT results of patients who \nunderwent EVAR,24,25 have provided important informa-\ntion on the dynamic interactions between the aortic wall, \nthe endoprosthesis, and blood flow. Several authors have \nadapted mathematical formulae to experimental models \nof abdominal aortic aneurysms before and after stent \ngraft deployment. These studies have concluded that, \neven in technically successful cases, certain areas of the \nendoprosthesis will always be more sensitive to hemo-\ndynamic changes, particularly at the aortic neck attach-\nment site and at the bifurcation of the iliac extensions. \nIn these areas, the endograft wall is subjected to strain, \n\nproducing a 1- to 2-newton drag force that pulls the de-\nvice distally.\n\nThese findings created a need for better understan-\nding the forces involved in endograft fixation. Lambert et \nal.26 assessed the mechanical behavior of endoprostheses \nimplanted in cadaveric aortas and found that, the greater \nthe extent of prosthesis oversizing and the contact area \nbetween the device and the artery, the greater the load \nrequired to dislodge it. In similar experiments, Malina \net al.27 found that hooks and barbs increase fixation even \nfurther. These studies have also provided important con-\ntributions by identifying the load required for dislodging \nendografts (3 N on average) and comparing it with mean \nhemodynamic drag forces (2 N). Despite their validity, \nhowever, these investigations failed to take into account \nseveral factors that interact with endoprostheses in the \nliving body, as all experimental testing was conducted in \ncadaveric aortas.\n\nProper graft fixation to the proximal neck also reduces \nthe risk of migration. Wolf et al.18 reported a higher num-\nber of migration and type I endoleak events when there was \npoor apposition of the stent graft to the aortic wall. This is \nexplained by decreased contact area and by leakage throu-\ngh folds in the graft fabric, leading to reduced friction and \nfixation forces.\n\nDistal fixation was investigated by Volodos et al.,28 who \ncarried out in vitro assessment of straight and bifurcated \npolytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts in a specially desig-\nned model: a plastic cylinder mimicking an aortic aneu-\nrysm was connected to a pulsatile flow circuit powered by a \ncardiac pump, which subjected the system to different pres-\nsures. The authors found only minor changes in diameter, \nbut significant changes in graft length and distal kinking, \nculminating in displacement of the device when load ex-\nceeded 208 g (approximately 2 N), thus demonstrating the \nimportance of distal fixation. In fact, the importance of \nproper distal fixation is proven by the high rate distal dis-\nplacement-related complications in patients receiving first-\ngeneration endoprostheses, which lacked adequate stent \nsupport in the iliac regions. \n\nIn addition to aneurysm- and endoprosthesis-re-\nlated aspects, certain clinical changes may destabilize \ngraft fixation forces and encourage migration. Mohan \net al.29 studied 2,862 post-EVAR patients included in the \nEUROSTAR registry. Using Massey\u2019s formula,30 the au-\nthors analyzed significant (> 5 mm) migrations of the \nproximal end of stent grafts and their correlation with \nclinical features, and found that smoking and hyperten-\nsion were associated with increased risk of migration. \n\n\n\nMigration of endoprosthesis - Almeida MJ et al.J Vasc Bras 2010, Vol. 9, N\u00ba 264\n\nSmoking is an important determinant of aneurysmal \nwall dilatation, with an added harmful effect in weake-\nned arterial walls as a potentiator of protease activity.31-33 \nHypertension was significantly correlated with migra-\ntion, as it increases the hemodynamic forces that push \nthe graft caudally.\n\nIn short, an understanding of relevant biomechanical \nforces is a key element to be considered in the choice of \nendoprosthesis and EVAR technique.\n\nMigration and device type\n\nTable 1 shows differences in complication rates de-\npending on the type of endoprosthetic device. These com-\nparisons must be viewed cautiously, as they represent the \nwork of different teams with varying levels of experien-\nce in EVAR and patients with heterogeneous aneurysm \ncharacteristics.\n\nDifferences in migration rates may be explained by \nstent design \u2013 namely, by the choice of material used in \ngraft construction and by mode of fixation. Resch et al.,34 \nfor instance, used Dacron-covered, Gianturco stent-based \ngraft prototypes with proximal fixation hooks in most ca-\nses, whereas other authors used third-generation commer-\ncial endografts, the design of which has been substantially \nperfected.14,16,21,22,35,36\n\nThe considerable variation in migration rates (1.8\u2013\n45%) also reflects differences in study criteria, such as \nlength of follow-up, choice of technique and operator \nexperience. \n\nTonnensem et al.22 found lower migration rates after \nuse of Zenith devices. However, the authors already had ex-\ntensive EVAR experience when they began using this model \n\nof endoprosthesis, which may have biased their results. At \nany rate, mid- and long-term assessment studies appear to \nsupport lower migration rates with use of endoprostheses \nthat employ auxiliary fixation systems.16 Longer follow-up \nstudies should define whether this lower likelihood of mi-\ngration is sustained over time.\n\nFactors involved in migration\n\nAneurysm neck morphology\n\nThe shorter the length of the aneu  \nrysm neck, the smaller the contact area between endo-\nprosthesis and artery, thus hampering device fixation. \nThere is no objective definition of the minimal area re-\nquired for adequate fixation, but most authors empirically \nrecommend a length of 15 mm.37\n\nAneurysm neck angle appears to influence duration \nof surgery and post-EVAR complication rates. Sternberg \net al.38 measured aortic neck angulation (the angle formed \nbetween the aortic neck and the longitudinal axis of the \naneurysm) and classified it as severe (? 70\u00ba), moderate (40 \nto 59\u00ba) or mild (&lt;40\u00ba). The authors found higher rates of \ncomplications (such as type I endoleak, aneurysm expan-\nsion and graft migration), endovascular reintervention, and \nconversion to open repair in patients with severe aortic neck \nangulation. Furthermore, procedure duration was longer in \nthese patients due to greater difficulty in endograft place-\nment. The authors concluded that EVAR should be discou-\nraged in patients with aortic neck angles greater than 40\u00ba. \nAlbertini et al.19 assessed the risk of proximal type I endo-\nleak and migration and their correlation with aortic neck \nsize, shape, and angulation. The authors found neck angle \n\nAuthors Sample size\n(n)\n\nFollow-up (months) Endoprosthesis Definition (mm) Migration rate (%)\n\nConners et al.14 91 33.2\u00b11.1 AneuRx\u00ae (Medtronic) ?5 16\n\nEngland et al.16 55 41 Talent\u00ae (Medtronic) ?10 16.6\n\nZarins et al.21 1119 30\u00b111 (0.5-61) AneuRx\u00ae \u201cAny distal displacement\u201d 8.4\n\nTonnensen et al.22 77 39\u00b12.3 AneuRx\u00ae ?5 28\n\n?10 18.8\n\n53 30.8\u00b11.9 Zenith\u00ae \n(Cook)\n\n?5 7.5\n\n?10 1.8\n\nResch et al.34 58 29 (1-49) Ivancev-Malmo, Chuter >5 45\n\nCao et al.35 113 28 (24-46) AneuRx\u00ae ?10 15\n\nSternberg et al.36 261 12 Zenith\u00ae >5 2.3\n\nTable 1 \u2013 Migration rates and device type.\n\n\n\nMigration of endoprosthesis - Almeida MJ et al. J Vasc Bras 2010, Vol. 9, N\u00ba 2 65\n\nto be the predominant factor associated with complications \n(Figure 1). Two major mechanisms explain this finding:\n1) Tortuous proximal sites reduce the contact area betwe-\n\nen the device and the arterial surface, decreasing fric-\ntion, which tends to anchor the device;\n\n2) Hemodynamic studies show that the force exerted by \nblood flow against the vessel wall at a single point is \nproportional to the square of the velocity of flow at that \npoint. Thus, flow velocity is increased in tortuous ar-\nteries, leading to increased drag forces. This, coupled \nwith the fact that blood columns directly impact a lar-\nger surface of the kinked endoprosthesis, would increa-\nse the likelihood of distal displacement even further.38,39\n\nSome authors have reported the use of endopros-\ntheses in very large neck AAAs (> 28 mm diameter) \nas a predisposing factor for graft migration; other stu-\ndies, however, have found no such correlation.36 A gre-\nater likelihood of neck dilation 10 years after repair has \nalso been reported when proximal cuff diameter at the \ntime of EVAR exceeded 28 mm.40 Considering that pos-\ntoperative aneurysm neck expansion is a known pre-\ndisposing factor for migration and that large neck are \nmore likely to expand, one may infer that endovascu-\nlar repair of large neck aneurysms would be inherently \ncomplication-prone.14,41\n\nThrombi, calcification, and other irregularities of the \naortic neck wall are also associated with poor endoprosthe-\nsis fixation and increased likelihood of migration:\n1) Thrombi found at the aneurysm neck have a friable \n\nsurface, which decreases the area of friction between \nthe device and the arterial wall;\n\n2) Irregularities and calcification of the arterial wall lead \nto deformities or minor kinks and folds in the endo-\nprosthesis. This reduces contact area, and type I endo-\nleak may also occur through these points;28\n\n3) Calcifications also harden the arterial wall, reducing \ncomplacency and decreasing device seating.\n\nAneurysm size and migration\n\nLarger aneurysm size significantly correlates with \nparameters that predispose do endograft migration. \nLarge aneurysms (> 55 mm) tend to have shorter, wi-\nder and more tortuous necks, which would thus incre-\nase the risk of migration.42,43 Ouriel et al.44 assessed 700 \npatients according to aneurysm size, classified as small \n(&lt;55 mm) or large (> 55 mm), and found a statistically \nhigher rate of migration and type I endoleak in the latter \ngroup. Aneurysms with smaller diameters were deemed \n\nmore anatomically suitable for EVAR, which may explain \nthe lower rate of complications in narrower aneurysms. \nIn their five-year follow-up of 923 post-EVAR patients, \nZarins et al.45 grouped aneurysm diameter into three size \nclasses (small, &lt;50 mm; medium, 50 to 59 mm; large, \n> 60 mm) and found no significant differences in mi-\ngration, leakage or aneurysm expansion rates. They did, \nhowever, report significantly higher rates of conversion \nto open repair and rupture-related mortality in patients \nwith larger aneurysms. Interestingly, as conversion to \nopen repair is usually prompted by leaks, migration or \naneurysm expansion, higher conversion rates may corre-\nlate with these events.\n\nRecent studies have shown improved outcomes and \nlower migration rates in patients with aneurysms smaller \nthan 55 mm in diameter, which provide an anatomically \nfavorable setting for EVAR.46 However, it bears noting \nthat patients with small aneurysms undergoing purely \nclinical treatment aimed at controlling blood pressure \nhave a low risk of rupture (0.6% per year). Indications \nfor EVAR must therefore take life expectancy and risk \nof the endovascular procedure (and possible reinterven-\ntion) into account.47\n\nOversizing and migration\n\nMohan et al.48 reported increased rates of type I endo-\nleak when grafts were oversized less than 10%, and sugges-\nted 10 to 20% oversizing as adequate. Almeida &amp; Yoshida49 \nimplanted 10- to 20%-oversized endografts in a swine \naorta model. After 14 days, biomechanical assessment was \n\nFigura 1 - Medida do \u00e2ngulo do colo do aneurisma segundo Sternberg et al.38\n\n\n\nMigration of endoprosthesis - Almeida MJ et al.J Vasc Bras 2010, Vol. 9, N\u00ba 266\n\nconducted to ascertain the displacement load required \nto dislodge the device from the aorta. In the 20% over-\nsizing group, displacement load was statistically higher \nthan in the 10% oversizing group. This may be explained \nby the increased radial strength of the stent struts, which \nwould penetrate the wall of the aorta and reach deeper \ninto the tunica media. Some authors50 have posited that \ngreater oversizing would produce a greater inflammatory \nresponse at the vessel wall, improving stent fixation and \nintegration as well. In smaller vessels, such as the coronary \narteries, greater oversizing would produce an even more \nintense inflammatory response, leading to intimal hyper-\nplasia and early thrombosis.51,52 In larger arteries, however, \ngreater inflammation would increase prosthesis fixation, \npreventing graft migration. Histological examinations \ncarried out in the Almeida &amp; Yoshida study corroborate \nresults reported elsewhere in the literature, showing that \na fibroblastic reaction, with attending inflammation and \nareas of neovascularization, occurred only in the 20% \noversizing group.\n\nHowever, weakness of the aneurysmal aortic wall must \nbe taken into consideration;31-33 due to this factor, the addi-\ntional strain of oversizing would produce a dilatation of the \naortic neck over time.53,54 This trend has been proven by \nSternberg et al.,36 who reported higher rates of type I en-\ndoleak and aneurysmal neck expansion in patients whose \nendografts were oversized more than 30%.\n\nExcessive oversizing was also associated with worse \naneurysmal sac outcomes, such as lower reduction rates \nand greater expansion, when compared with &lt;30% graft \noversizing. Migration rates are also higher, probably due to \naneurysmal neck expansion. Schurink et al.17 carried out \nexperimental studies of endograft implantation in an in \nvitro model using cadaveric aortic segments. After device \ndeployment, the authors performed vascular ultrasound, \nangioscopy, angiography and CT scanning. Results showed \na relationship between the presence of folds in the fabric \nand prostate diameter; the greater the degree of oversizing, \nthe greater the number and size of graft fabric folds asso-\nciated with significant perigraft leaks. Although this par-\nticular experimental study used water as a substitute for \nblood, which may have led to overestimation of leakage, the \nuntoward effects of excessive device oversizing were clearly \nestablished.\n\nEndograft incorporation\n\nAs mentioned above, the immediate success of EVAR is \ndue to mechanical forces acting on the endoprosthesis and \n\naorta. However, incorporation of the endograft fabric to the \narterial wall, producing a permanent hemostatic seal, is de-\nsirable for medium- and long-term outcomes. The ability to \nobtain a healing process is absolutely critical in preventing \nmigration and protecting against aneurysm rupture. Table 2 \nlists some studies of endoprosthesis incorporation.\n\nTissue incorporation varies depending on the material \nfrom which the device is made. Past studies have shown \nthat tissue incorporation of PTFE devices is poor as a con-\nsequence of their hydrophobic surface, which would pose a \nlimit to cell adhesion. Dacron-covered endografts have in-\ntermediate tissue incorporation capacity, whereas polyure-\nthane devices induce a more intense inflammatory process \nand greater cell adhesion, which translate into better endo-\nthelialization and fixation to adjacent tissues. Limiting their \nuse, however, is the fact that polyurethane endoprosthesis \nare mechanically weak and tend to degenerate.55,56,59\n\nStudies investigating endografts removed from pa-\ntients\u2019 bodies provide conflicting accounts of the tissue \nincorporation process. Some authors59,60 have reported a \ngood endothelialization response and good fixation into \nthe artery, while others have reported little graft adhesion \nto the vascular wall.55,56 These dissonant findings may be ex-\nplained by differences in choice of material and by the low \nnumber of cases described in the literature. Furthermore, \nsome patients mentioned in these reports had developed \ntypical complications of EVAR, such as leakage or migra-\ntion, which interfered with histological examination of the \ndevice. Analysis of uncomplicated grafts was thus limited \nto those removed from the small number of patients who \ndied from non-EVAR-related causes, such as myocardial \ninfarction or stroke,55-59 further decreasing the number of \nuseful cases.\n\nIn animal experiments, the tissue incorporation pro-\ncess has somewhat differed from that found in human \nstudies. In swine and sheep \u2013 the most common animal \nmodels of endoprosthesis implantation \u2013 results were far \nmore exuberant than those found in human studies due to \ninterspecies differences. Furthermore, all experimental stu-\ndies published in the literature were performed on normal \narteries with none of the typical aortic wall changes, such \nas calcification and thrombi. Evidence suggests that inflam-\nmatory response and incorporation occur differently in the \nhuman aneurysmal aorta.60,61\n\nIn light of these results, studies assessing endografts after \ntheir removal from human patients and those conducted in \nanimal models must be viewed and interpreted cautiously.\n\nMedium- and long-term follow-up of EVAR patients \nhas shown that risk of migration is permanent, and that \n\n\n\nMigration of endoprosthesis - Almeida MJ et al. J Vasc Bras 2010, Vol. 9, N\u00ba 2 67\n\nsubstantial complication rates persist for years after repair. \nThese findings suggest that the tissue incorporation process \noccurs only partially and is not enough to prevent late com-\nplications, such as endograft migration.\n\nFuture prospects\n\nSeveral recent studies have been conducted with the \npurpose of developing endoprosthetic devices that heal bet-\nter into the arterial wall.62,63\n\nTwo basic factors prevent adequate tissue incor-\nporation of stent grafts. The first is the use of PTFE or \nDacron, which are inert materials and thus have little \npotential for tissue incorporation. The second is asso-\nciated with a peculiar characteristic of the aneurysmal \nwall: depletion and decreased resistance to apoptosis of \nmyointimal cells, which play an essential role in tissue \nincorporation.62\n\nStudies have been conducted with the aim of impro-\nving the tissue incorporation process by adding coatings \n\nAuthor Sample Time to explant Device type Gross appearance Histological findings\n\nMcArthur et al.55 Grafts recovered from 11 \npatients\n\n4 days\u201318 months \n(mean, 9 months)\n\nTalent=7\nMegs PTFE=3\nExcluder PTFE=1\n\nTranslucent material \ncovering graft ends, \nthrombi\n\nOrganized thrombus, absence \nof myointimal cells, poor tissue \nincorporation across all samples\n\nMalina\net al.56\n\nGrafts recovered from 23 \npatients\n\n1\u201331 months \n(mean, 9 months)\n\nDacron endografts \nand Gianturco stents\n\nLittle adhesion Fibrin, organized thrombus\nIn some samples, thin layer of cells, \nactin, and some collagen on the luminal \nsurface\n\nWhite\net al.59\n\nSingle patient explant \n(67yo)\n\n67 days Dacron endografts \nand Palmaz\u00ae stent \n(J&amp;J)\n\nModerate adhesion Incipient healing, giant multinucleated \ncells and collagen surrounding graft\n\nMcGahan\net al.57\n\nSingle patient explant \n(73yo)\n\n7 months EGS (Endovascular \nGrafting System) \nDacron endografts, \nsteel stent\n\nProximal end of stent \ncovered by shiny \nmaterial\n\nProximal end: good tissue \nincorporation, collagen, myofibroblasts, \ngiant multinucleated cells \nDistal end: mild inflammation, less \nneointima\n\nShin\net al.59\n\nTwo patient explants (76 \nand 77yo)\n\n20 and 42 days Polycarbonate \nurethane Corvita\u00ae \nbifurcated grafts \nat the iliac arteries, \nElgiloy wire\n\nEndograft firmly \nadhered to the \narterial well\n\nGood ingrowth of tissue into the \nproximal 2 cm of the graft, collagen, \nendothelialization, and smooth muscle \ncells present.\n\nLambert\net al.60\n\nExperimental animal study \n(13 swine)\n\nSerial follow-up (1, 3, 6,\n12 months)\n\nNitinol-mesh Dacron \nendografts\n\n1 month: signs of \ningrowth, neointima\n3 months: proximal \nand distal ingrowth\n6 and 12 months: \nsignificant adhesion \nof graft to artery\n\n1 month: organized fibrin, intense \ninflammatory reaction, lymphocytes, \ngiant cells\n3 months: chronic inflammatory \nreaction, increased number of \nlymphocytes and giant cells, neointimal \nformation.\n6 and 12 months: inflammatory \ncells replaced with myointimal and \nendothelial cells.

The chemical properties of Nitrile \ncoated surfaces is believed to favor certain intracellular \nsignaling pathways, modulating expression of integrin \nreceptors, which are responsible for intercellular adhe-\nsion. Integrins also activate the integrin-linked kinase \nand phosphatidylinositol pathways, which are believed to \nplay a key role in inhibiting apoptosis. Chondroitin sulfate \nwould decrease apoptosis by acting on a similar kinase pa-\nthway (specifically, the P13K pathway). The authors con-\nclude that the use of these substances may be an important \noption in manufacturing stent grafts with added capacity \nto incorporate into adjacent tissues.\n\nDevice porosity appears to influence the tissue incor-\nporation process. Experimental studies suggest that, in \nlower-porosity grafts, the myointimal cells responsible for \ntissue ingrowth migrate from the ends of the graft and cover \nan intraluminal area of up to 20 mm. In microporous grafts, \ncapillaries and vascular smooth muscle cells derived from \nthe underlying granulation tissue have been found to pe-\nnetrate the pores present throughout the device, producing \nimproved graft coating. Studies are currently underway to \nimprove graft porosity and cell adhesion as a means of in-\ncreasing tissue incorporation.64\n\nVan der Bas et al.63 implanted collagen- and fibro-\nblast growth factor-soaked Dacron endografts in the \nporcine aorta and found significant improvement in \ntissue incorporation at 8 weeks post-implantation. The \nauthors observed neointimal growth and, on immu-\nnofluorescence studies, detected an increased number \nsmooth muscle cells consistent with myofibroblast and \nmyointimal cell proliferation. This study proved that in \nvivo induction of fibroplasia is possible, despite variables \nsuch as blood pressure and the blood flow effect, which \nwere expected to \u201cwash away\u201d any substances impregna-\nted into the graft. \n\nGene therapy studies are currently investigating al-\nternatives for improving the tissue incorporation process. \nEton et al.65 implanted myointimal cells transduced with \ntissue plasminogen activator genes. Cells were suffused \n\ninto a dual-layer Dacron endograft and implanted into \ndog aortas. According to the authors, grafts removed at 1, \n2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 months were highly populated with gene-\ntically modified smooth muscle cells, with increased t-PA \nantigen levels and t-PA activity, both of which were desi-\nred outcomes of the transduction procedure. The authors \nconcluded that endografts can serve as an important de-\nlivery vehicle for transduced cells. Although not its main \nobjective, the Eton study revealed the possibility of indu-\ncing greater fibroplasias by employing cells transduced \nwith genes that increase proliferation of vascular smooth \nmuscle cells or fibroblasts, leading to improved graft in-\ncorporation and fixation.\n\nAlmeida &amp; Yoshida49 implanted Dacron-coated niti-\nnol stent grafts in porcine thoracic aorta, applied fibrin \nglue to the interface between the graft and the endo-\nthelium, and compared the results to a control group in \nwhich no fibril glue was used. On the 14th postopera-\ntive day, biomechanical testing was conducted to mea-\nsure the displacement load required for dislodging the \ndevice, as in the work of Malina et al.27 and Lambert et \nal.26 Displacement load was significantly increased in \nthe fibrin glue group, and histological testing confirmed \nincreased fibroplasia in the group. The authors conclu-\nded that application of fibrin glue to the endoprosthesis/\naorta interface may become an important step in impro-\nving graft adhesion and tissue incorporation to prevent \nmigration. \n\nIn conclusion, continuous improvement of endopros-\nthetic devices has led to the development of improved \nmaterials, with greater wear resistance and reduced cross-\nsections. Current progress is moving towards development \nof mesh coatings that improve tissue incorporation, so as \nto improve long-term results and prevent endograft migra-\ntion, which is still a major hurdle to positive outcomes in \nEVAR.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
