Type 1 \n\nand in many cases type 2 diabetic patients require daily insulin injections to \n\ncontrol blood glucose levels and retard the appearance of diabetes-related \n\ncomplications. The liver plays a central role in the context of whole-body \n\nglucose homoeostasis and fuel management in general. Under physiological \n\nconditions, insulin is released by the pancreas into the portal vein and \n\nreaches the liver along with the nutrient flow absorbed in the \n\ngastrointestinal tract (GIT). Under these conditions, the actions of insulin on \n\nliver metabolism play a key role in promoting glucose and lipid storage. \n\nDM is characterized by impairment of these actions resulting in abnormal \n\nlevels of blood glucose and lipids that, if left untreated, provoke widespread \n\nsecondary complications. With current therapies, insulin is delivered \n\nsubcutaneously and this results in a predominantly peripheral uptake, in \n\ncontrast with the physiological release profile. The experimental work \n\ndescribed on this thesis addressed the pathways for glucose disposal and \n\nstorage in the liver under two experimental settings representing the fasted \n\nto fed transition and the fed state. The studies were performed in non-\n\ndiabetic control rats and in a rat model for type 1 DM, the streptozotocin \n\n(STZ)-diabetic rat. The delivery of insulin by alternative liver-targeted \n\nroutes was also explored. \n\nA general introduction is presented in chapter 1. Diabetes and its \n\ntherapy are briefly addressed and the STZ-diabetic rat model for the study \n\nof type 1 DM is introduced. Hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism are \n\noverviewed with emphasis to its regulatory aspects, and molecular \n\nmechanisms of insulin signaling are integrated with the metabolic \n\nregulation. In the last section of this chapter the use of stable isotope tracers \n\nfor the study of hepatic metabolism is briefly overviewed.  \n\n\n\nxxii| \n \n\nIn the studies described in chapter 2, rats were challenged with a \n\ncarbohydrate load after a 24-hour fast and glucose disposal was addressed \n\nby carbon 13 (13C) and deuterium (2H) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) \n\nspectroscopy. One group of animals was given a glucose load and the other \n\na mixture consisting of 9 equivalents of glucose and 1 equivalent of \n\ngalactose. Hepatic glycogen was depleted with fasting and increased 8-10 \n\ntimes after the carbohydrate loads. The gluconeogenic flux dominated both \n\nglycogen synthesis and endogenous glucose production (EGP). Galactose \n\nhepatic metabolization resulted in a decreased contribution of load glucose \n\nto glycogen but apparently had little effect on the clearance of load glucose \n\nfrom the blood. \n\nChapter 3 presents the glucose challenge study performed in STZ-\n\ndiabetic rats after a 24-hour fast. One group of animals was injected insulin \n\nby the subcutaneous (s.c.) route prior to receiving the glucose load. In \n\nanother group insulin was delivered to the intraperitoneal (i.p.) cavity to \n\nprovide a higher portal/peripheral ratio and target the liver. In a last group, \n\nrats did not receive any treatment. Glucose disposal was traced by 13C and \n2H NMR methods. There was no net hepatic glycogen synthesis during the \n\ntest, not even in the insulin-treated rats. The untreated STZ-diabetic rats \n\nshowed increased EGP coupled with reduced clearance of load glucose. The \n\nabsolute contribution of EGP to blood glucose in the insulin-treated rats was \n\nreduced to control levels, regardless of the route of insulin administration. \n\nGlucose clearance was highly enhanced in the insulin-treated rats even \n\nwhen compared to controls. These studies indicate that in the context of a \n\nglucose challenge, the stimulatory effect of insulin on glucose uptake is \n\nmuch higher than its inhibitory effect on EGP. \n\nThe absorptive state was addressed in chapter 4, and hepatic \n\nmetabolism was studied in ad libitum fed STZ-diabetic and non-diabetic \n\ncontrol rats with the deuterated water (2H2O) tracer approach. In controls, \n\nnet glycogen synthesis during an overnight feeding accounted for one third \n\nof the hepatic stores and was equally derived from the direct and indirect \n\n(gluconeogenic) pathways. The amount of glycogen synthesized by diabetic \n\n\n\n|xxiii \n\nrats was similar to controls in all stages of the disease but the hepatic \n\nglycogen content was lower 10 and 20 days after the induction by STZ, \n\nindicating that those animals had higher glycogen turnover rates. There was \n\na progressive increase of the indirect pathway contribution to hepatic \n\nglycogen synthesis from 70% 4 days after diabetes induction to 90% at 10 \n\nand 20 days of the disease. Parallel to the disruption in glycogen synthesis, \n\nthe contribution of gluconeogenesis to EGP was profoundly increased 10 \n\nand 20 days after diabetes induction but not in the earlier stage (4 days). The \n\nlipogenic pathway was promptly reduced 4 days after the induction of \n\ndiabetes but the hepatic triglyceride (TG) content was similar to controls. \n\nWith the progression of the diabetic condition, the contribution of the \n\nlipolytic flux increased, resulting in elevated hepatic TG content. \n\nChapter 5 describes the insulin replacement experiments in STZ-\n\ndiabetic rats. The treatment protocol consisted in two daily injections by the \n\ns.c. or i.p. route and was carried out for 10 days. Hepatic metabolism was \n\nthen addressed by the 2H2O method under natural feeding conditions. Gene \n\nexpression and enzyme activity assays were also performed in liver samples \n\nfrom those rats. With both treatments there was a restoration of the direct \n\npathway to glycogen synthesis and of the pathways to EGP. In the i.p.-\n\ntreated rats glycogen stores could be recovered to control levels. The \n\nlipogenic pathway was also enhanced but was still lower than controls in \n\nboth s.c.- and i.p.-treated groups. Despite the improvements on glycogen \n\nand TG synthesis in the liver, the gluconeogenic and lipolytic fluxes could \n\nnot be efficiently suppressed with the insulin-replacement protocols. \n\nChapter 6 explores the use of novel nanoparticle-based delivery \n\nsystems in insulin therapy. Experiments in control rats showed that the \n\nhypoglycemic response following s.c. injection of insulin was enhanced by \n\nthe use of nanoparticles from poly-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA), especially \n\nwhen ?-cyclodextrin esters with 10 carbon alkyl chains (?-CDC10) were \n\npresent in the formulation. The oral route was also investigated but the \n\nnanoparticles were ineffective even after coating with an enteric polymer. \n\nExperiments in STZ-diabetic rats did not demonstrate any benefit of the \n\n\n\nxxiv| \n \n\nnanoparticle formulation relative to a standard insulin solution in terms of \n\nthe hypoglycemic response following the s.c. injection nor in the context of a \n\nglucose challenge.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n|xxv \n\nRESUMO \n\nA diabetes mellitus constitui um perturba\u00e7\u00e3o metab\u00f3lica que resulta \n\nde uma disfun\u00e7\u00e3o na secre\u00e7\u00e3o (tipo 1) e/ou sensibilidade (tipo 2) \u00e0 insulin. \n\nOs doentes do tipo 1, e em muitos casos tamb\u00e9m do tipo 2, necessitam de \n\ninjec\u00e7\u00f5es di\u00e1rias de insulina para controlar os n\u00edveis plasm\u00e1ticos de glucose \n\ne retardar o aparecimento de complica\u00e7\u00f5es relacionadas com a doen\u00e7a.

Em condi\u00e7\u00f5es fisiol\u00f3gicas, a insulina \u00e9 secretada \n\npelo p\u00e2ncreas para a veia porta e chega ao f\u00edgado de forma consertada com \n\na absor\u00e7\u00e3o de nutrientes no tracto gastrointestinal.

A diabetes \u00e9 caracterizada \n\npor perturba\u00e7\u00f5es nestes efeitos, que se refletem em n\u00edveis anormais de \n\nglucose e l\u00edpidos no sangue, os quais, n\u00e3o corrigidos, provocam o \n\nalastramento de complica\u00e7\u00f5es secund\u00e1rias. Na terap\u00eautica tradicional, a \n\ninsulina \u00e9 administrada por via subcut\u00e2nea (s.c.), o que resulta numa \n\ninsuliniza\u00e7\u00e3o predominantemente perif\u00e9rica, por oposi\u00e7\u00e3o ao perfil de \n\nliberta\u00e7\u00e3o fisiol\u00f3gico. O trabalho experimental descrito nesta tese estudou a \n\ncapta\u00e7\u00e3o e consumo de glucose pelo organismo e seu armazenamento no \n\nf\u00edgado em dois contextos experimentais representando a transi\u00e7\u00e3o do jejum \n\npara o estado prandial e o estado prandial propriamente dito. Os ensaios \n\nforam realizados em ratos controlo e ratos tornados diab\u00e9ticos por indu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ncom estreptozotocina (STZ), um modelo animal para a diabetes tipo 1. \n\nForam ainda estudadas vias alternativas para administra\u00e7\u00e3o de insulina \n\ndireccionada ao f\u00edgado. \n\nO cap\u00edtulo 1 apresenta uma indrodu\u00e7\u00e3o geral. A diabetes e o seu \n\ntratamento s\u00e3o abordados de forma breve e o modelo animal de diabetes \n\ninduzida por STZ \u00e9 apresentado.

Por \u00faltimo, a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de substratos \n\nenriquecidos com is\u00f3topos est\u00e1veis ao estudo do metabolismo hep\u00e1tico \u00e9 \n\napresentada. \n\nNos ensaios descritos no cap\u00edtulo 2, os ratos receberam uma dose \n\nmassiva de a\u00e7\u00facares ap\u00f3s 24 horas de jejum e o consumo de glucose foi \n\nseguido por espectroscopia de resson\u00e2ncia magn\u00e9tica nuclear de carbono 13 \n\n(13C) e deut\u00e9rio (2H). A um grupo de animais foi administrada uma dose de \n\nglucose e a outro uma mistura que consistiu em 9 equivalentes de glucose e \n\n1 equivalente de galactose. As reservas de glicog\u00e9nio no f\u00edgado foram \n\nconsumidas no per\u00edodo de jejum e aumentaram 8-10 vezes ap\u00f3s a ingest\u00e3o \n\ndas doses de a\u00e7\u00facares. Tanto a produ\u00e7\u00e3o end\u00f3gena de glucose como a \n\ns\u00edntese de glicog\u00e9nio hep\u00e1tico foram dominadas pelo fluxo da \n\nneoglucog\u00e9nese. A metaboliza\u00e7\u00e3o hep\u00e1tica da galactose reduziu a \n\ncontribui\u00e7\u00e3o da glucose ex\u00f3gena para a s\u00edntese de glicog\u00e9nio mas pouco \n\nalterou a capta\u00e7\u00e3o de glucose do sangue. \n\nO cap\u00edtulo 3 descreve a prova de toler\u00e2ncia \u00e0 glucose realizada em \n\nratos diab\u00e9ticos por indu\u00e7\u00e3o com STZ, ap\u00f3s 24 horas de jejum. Um grupo de \n\nanimais recebeu insulina por via s.c. antes da dose de glucose. Num outro \n\ngrupo, a insulina foi injectada na cavidade intraperitoneal (i.p.) para \n\naumentar a raz\u00e3o portal/perif\u00e9rica e direccionar a insulina para o f\u00edgado. \n\nUm \u00faltimo grupo n\u00e3o recebeu qualquer tratamento. O consumo de glucose \n\nfoi avaliado por t\u00e9cnicas de RMN de 13C e 2H. N\u00e3o houve s\u00edntese l\u00edquida de \n\nglicog\u00e9nio no f\u00edgado, nem mesmo nos ratos injectados com insulina. Os \n\nratos diab\u00e9ticos que n\u00e3o foram injectados com insulina apresentaram um \n\naumento da produ\u00e7\u00e3o end\u00f3gena de glucose acompanhado por uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nda capta\u00e7\u00e3o de glucose plasm\u00e1tica. A contribui\u00e7\u00e3o absoluta da produ\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nend\u00f3gena para a glucose plasm\u00e1tica nos ratos diab\u00e9ticos injectados com \n\ninsulina foi igual \u00e0 observada nos controlos n\u00e3o diab\u00e9ticos, \n\nindependentemente da via de administra\u00e7\u00e3o. O consumo de glucose \n\nproveniente da dose administrada foi bastante aumentado, mesmo em \n\ncompara\u00e7\u00e3o com os controlos. Estes ensaios indicam que, no contexto de \n\n\n\n|xxvii \n\numa prova de toler\u00e2ncia \u00e0 glucose, a ac\u00e7\u00e3o da insulina \u00e9 mais not\u00f3ria na \n\nestimula\u00e7\u00e3o da capta\u00e7\u00e3o de glucose do sangue do que na inibi\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o end\u00f3gena de glucose. \n\nO estado prandial propriamente dito foi abordado no cap\u00edtulo 4. \n\nRatos controlo e diab\u00e9ticos por indu\u00e7\u00e3o com STZ alimentados ad libitum \n\nforam estudados e o seu metabolismo hep\u00e1tico avaliado pelo m\u00e9todo da \n\n\u00e1gua deuterada (2H2O). Nos ratos controlo, a s\u00edntese l\u00edquida de glicog\u00e9nio \n\ndurante uma noite de alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o representou um ter\u00e7o do conte\u00fado \n\nhep\u00e1tico e seguiu as vias directa e indirecta (neoglucog\u00e9nica) de forma \n\nequivalente. Os ratos diab\u00e9ticos sintetizaram uma quantidade de glicog\u00e9nio \n\nsimilar aos controlos em todos os est\u00e1dios da doen\u00e7a avaliados, mas o \n\nconte\u00fado hep\u00e1tico total diminui 10 e 20 dias depois da indu\u00e7\u00e3o da diabetes, \n\nsignificando que nestes casos houve uma maior renova\u00e7\u00e3o do glicog\u00e9nio \n\nhep\u00e1tico. Verificou-se um dom\u00ednio progressivo da via indirecta para a \n\ns\u00edntese de glicog\u00e9nio, que aumentou de 70% 4 dias ap\u00f3s a indu\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\ndiabetes para 90% 10 e 20 dias depois. Paralelamente \u00e0s altera\u00e7\u00f5es no \n\nmetabolismo do glicog\u00e9nio, a contribui\u00e7\u00e3o da neoglucog\u00e9nese para a \n\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o end\u00f3gena de glucose foi profundamente aumentada 10 e 20 dias \n\nap\u00f3s a indu\u00e7\u00e3o de diabetes mas manteve-se igual \u00e0 dos controlos aos 4 dias \n\nda doen\u00e7a. A via lipog\u00e9nica foi imediatamente reduzida 4 dias depois da \n\nindu\u00e7\u00e3o da diabetes mas o conte\u00fado hep\u00e1tico de triglicer\u00eddeos manteve-se \n\nigual ao dos controlos. Com a progress\u00e3o da doen\u00e7a, a contribui\u00e7\u00e3o do fluxo \n\nlipol\u00edtico aumentou, levando ao aumento do conte\u00fado hep\u00e1tico de \n\ntriglicer\u00eddeos. \n\nO cap\u00edtulo 5 relata as experi\u00eancias de reposi\u00e7\u00e3o da insulina em \n\nanimais diab\u00e9ticos. O protocolo de tratamento consistiu em duas injec\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ndi\u00e1rias por via s.c. ou i.p. durante 10 dias. O metabolismo hep\u00e1tico foi, \n\nent\u00e3o, seguido com 2H2O em condi\u00e7\u00f5es de alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o ad libitum. Foram \n\nainda feitos ensaios de express\u00e3o gen\u00e9tica e actividades enzim\u00e1ticas em \n\namostras de f\u00edgado destes animais. Ambos os tratamentos proporcionaram a \n\nrecupera\u00e7\u00e3o das vias de s\u00edntese hep\u00e1tica de glicog\u00e9nio bem como das vias \n\npara a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de glucose para valores controlo. Os animais injectados \n\n\n\nxxviii| \n \n\ncom insulina por via i.p. apresentaram n\u00edveis de glicog\u00e9nio no f\u00edgado \n\nsemelhantes aos controlos. A via lipog\u00e9nica tamb\u00e9m foi potenciada mas \n\nmanteve-se abaixo dos valores dos controlos com ambos os tratamentos. \n\nApesar das melhorias na s\u00edntese hep\u00e1tica de glicog\u00e9nio e triglicer\u00eddeos, os \n\nfluxos da neoglucog\u00e9nese e lip\u00f3lise n\u00e3o foram suprimidos com os \n\nprotocolos de reposi\u00e7\u00e3o de insulina. \n\nO cap\u00edtulo 6 explora o uso de novas formula\u00e7\u00f5es de nanopart\u00edculas \n\nna terap\u00eautica com insulina. As experi\u00eancias em ratos controlo mostraram \n\nque a ac\u00e7\u00e3o hipoglic\u00e9mica da insulina foi potenciada atrav\u00e9s do uso de \n\nnanopart\u00edculas de um co-pol\u00edmero de \u00e1cido l\u00e1ctico e glic\u00f3lico (PLGA), \n\nmormente com a inclus\u00e3o de esters da ?-ciclodextrina com cadeias alqu\u00edlicas \n\nde 10 carbonos (?-CDC10). A via oral tamb\u00e9m foi investigada mas a \n\nformula\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o se mostrou eficaz, nem quando as nanopart\u00edculas foram \n\nrevestidas com um pol\u00edmero ent\u00e9rico. Nas experi\u00eancias em ratos diab\u00e9ticos \n\npor indu\u00e7\u00e3o com STZ n\u00e3o ficou demonstrado qualquer benef\u00edcio da \n\nformula\u00e7\u00e3o de nanopart\u00edculas em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o padr\u00e3o de insulina \n\nem termos de ac\u00e7\u00e3o hipoglic\u00e9mica ap\u00f3s administra\u00e7\u00e3o s.c. nem no contexto \n\nde uma prova de toler\u00e2ncia \u00e0 glucose. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n|xxix \n\nLIST OF PUBLICATIONS \n\nPart of the scientific work presented in this thesis has been published \n\nin the following articles in peer-reviewed international scientific journals or \n\nis under preparation in the following manuscripts: \n\n \n\nSoares AF, Carvalho RA &amp; Veiga FJ (2007), Oral administration of peptides \n\nand proteins: nanoparticles and cyclodextrins as biocompatible \n\ndelivery systems.

Life relies on \n\nthe flux of matter and energy through the cellular metabolic pathways and \n\nduring these processes the balance between nutrient intake and the release \n\nof excretory products must be maintained (Fell 1997). Several levels of \n\ncontrol including biochemical, endocrine, physiological, neuronal and \n\nbehavioral are involved in the interplay between energy intake, storage and \n\nexpenditure (Friedman 1995). The liver is a central organ in the context of \n\nenergy balance and fuel management and hence plays an important role in \n\nwhole-body metabolism.  \n\nGlucose is a universal source of energy for cells in the organism. The \n\nliver is responsible both for glucose production during fasting and its \n\ndisposal and storage in the fed state. Those pathways are connected to the \n\nprocessing of other fuels like lipids and proteins in the intricate network of \n\nwhole-body metabolism. Glucose, protein and lipid metabolism are \n\n\n\n2|Chapter 1 \n \n\nregulated, among other factors, by the pancreatic hormone insulin. Diabetes \n\nmelittus (DM) is characterized by a dysfunction of insulin secretion and/or \n\nsensitivity, which results in metabolic disruptions.  \n\nThe following sections address briefly DM pathology and treatment \n\nas well as an experimental animal model for its study. Hepatic glucose and \n\nlipid metabolism is overviewed with focus on its regulatory aspects and \n\nintegration with insulin action. Finally, tracer-based approaches to the study \n\nof these metabolic pathways are generally discussed.  \n\n \n\n1.1 Diabetes mellitus \n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) describes DM as \u201ca \n\nmetabolic disorder of multiple etiology characterized by chronic \n\nhyperglycemia with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein \n\nmetabolism, resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action or \n\nboth\u201d (WHO 1999). The WHO report from 2006 recommends as diagnosis \n\ncriteria fasting plasma glucose ? 7.0 mM (126 mg/dL) or 2-hour1 plasma \n\nglucose ? 11.1 mM (200 mg/dL) (WHO 2006).  \n\nThe current classification of DM is based on the clinical stages as \n\nwell as the etiology of the disease (WHO 1999). Type 1 DM results from ? \n\ncell destruction secondary to idiopathic or auto-immune factors; whereas \n\ntype 2 DM may range from predominantly insulin resistance with relative \n\ninsulin deficiency to predominantly insulin deficiency with relative insulin \n\nresistance. The previous types constitute the basic forms of diabetes and \n\nwhile there may be several therapeutic options for type 2 diabetic patients, \n\nthe treatment of type 1 DM relies completely on the administration of \n\nexogenous insulin. With insulin administration (to type 1 and in some cases \n\nalso type 2 diabetic patients) hyperglycemia is prevented and when a strict \n\nmetabolic control is followed (Atkinson et al. 2001), the diabetes-related \n\n                                                      \n1 Refers to the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) where plasma glucose is measured 2 hours \nafter the ingestion of a 75 g oral glucose load following an overnight fast. \n\n\n\nIntroduction|3 \n\ncomplications (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, heart disease, among \n\nothers) are delayed, with benefits for the patients\u2019 quality of life.  \n\n \n\n1.1.1 Insulin therapy and formulation \n\nBefore the discovery of insulin in the 1920s the life span of people \n\ndiagnosed with diabetes was rarely beyond childhood. Although insulin \n\ndoesn\u2019t cure diabetes, its value in the treatment of diabetic patients was \n\nimmediately recognized by the attribution of the Nobel Prize in Physiology \n\nand Medicine to Banting and Macleod in 1923 for \u201cThe discovery of insulin\u201d \n\n(Nobelprize.org 2010).  \n\nFollowing the discovery of insulin many advances were made \n\nconcerning its isolation and purification. In the 1980s the technology of \n\nrecombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) allowed for the industrial \n\nproduction and commercial expansion of human insulin and, in the last 15 \n\nyears, modified insulins (with altered amino acid sequences) produced by \n\nbiotechnology engineering techniques resulted in enhanced stability and/or \n\nmodulation of the duration of action (Pillai et al. 2001).  \n\nDespite the huge amount of improvements on insulin therapy, its \n\nadministration often requires multiple daily injections via the subcutaneous \n\n(s.c.) route. This is unpleasant for the patients, thus compromising their \n\ncompliance to the treatment. Furthermore, delivery by the s.c. route is \n\nunable to mimic the physiologic portal to peripheral gradient resulting in \n\ndeficient hepatic insulinization. This may limit the metabolic performance of \n\ninsulin-treated diabetic patients compared to that of healthy individuals, \n\nparticularly in the case of hepatic-specific actions such as glycogen kinetics \n\n(Bischof et al. 2002).  \n\nPresently, research on insulin formulation is focused on exploring \n\nmore patient-friendly routes such as the oral (e.g. Chalasani et al. 2007; \n\nDamg\u00e9 et al. 2007; Reis et al. 2008) or pulmonary (e.g. Johansson et al. 2002; \n\nAguiar et al. 2004). The oral route has the advantage of delivering insulin to \n\nthe portal vein, resembling the physiological release and appropriately \n\n\n\n4|Chapter 1 \n \n\ntargeting the liver. Therefore, effective oral delivery may constitute an \n\nimportant strategy for optimizing the metabolic effects of insulin. This can \n\nbe achieved by the use of specialized delivery systems such as nanoparticles \n\n(explored in chapter 6).  \n\nAlternatively to the insulin supplementation therapy, providing \n\ndiabetic patients with functional ? cells constitutes the ultimate goal of DM \n\ntreatment. Pancreas and isolated islet transplantation has allowed for \n\ndiabetic patients to produce their own insulin (Shapiro et al. 2000; \n\nSutherland et al. 1998). In the context of ? cell replacement, the liver is \n\ncommonly used as a surrogate for the pancreatic function. For example, in \n\nislet transplantation protocols the portal vein is used to graft the ? cells \n\n(Shapiro et al. 2000). Moreover, with advances in stem cell technology, cells \n\nin the liver have been reprogrammed to express the ? cell phenotype \n\n(Aguayo-Mazzucato et al. 2010; Halban et al. 2010; Wagner et al. 2010). In \n\naddition, using virus as gene delivery vehicles has allowed for the basal \n\nhepatic insulin expression in diabetic rats and translated into improved \n\nglycemic control (Dong et al. 2002).  \n\n \n\n1.1.2 The STZ-diabetic rat as a model for type 1 diabetes \n\nThe diabetogenic action of streptozotocin (STZ) was discovered in \n\nthe 1960s (Junod et al. 1969) and ever since this drug has been widely used \n\nin the experimental setting to induce diabetes in rodents.  \n\n In rats, type 1 DM is induced by a single intravenous injection of \n\nSTZ at a dose no lower than 45 mg/kg (Junod et al. 1969). Alternatively, STZ \n\ncan be delivered to the intraperitoneal (i.p.) cavity at a dose no lower than \n\n50 mg/kg (Szkudelski 2001). Typically, doses of 50-65 mg/kg lead to \n\nchronic hyperglycemia and higher doses cause severe ketosis and death \n\nwithin days (Wei et al. 2003). Additionally, STZ can induce type 2 DM if rats \n\nare injected a high dose of the drug (~100 mg/kg) in the first days that \n\nfollow birth (Szkudelski 2001). \n\n\n\nIntroduction|5 \n\nStructurally, STZ is a nitrosouria derivative with a hexose moiety \n\nthat allows it to enter the cells by the same transporter as glucose. Uptake of \n\nSTZ occurs specifically via the glucose transporter 2 (Glut-2), which is the \n\nprincipal glucose transporter in rodent ? cells (Wollheim et al. 2004), and \n\nthis seems to be essential for its toxic action (Hosokawa et al. 2001). In \n\naddition, STZ is also toxic to other tissues expressing Glut-2, like the liver or \n\nthe kidney, and the damage on extra pancreatic cells may also account for \n\nthe pathology that characterizes the STZ-diabetic rat (Lenzen 2008). \n\nSeveral cytotoxicity mechanisms, ultimately leading to cell death, are \n\ndescribed for the deleterious action of STZ in ? cells. Streptozotocin causes \n\ndirect damage on DNA by alkylation (Bolz\u00e1n et al. 2002). In addition, STZ \n\nacts as a nitric oxide donor leading to the production of reactive oxygen \n\nspecies that also account for the DNA damage (Szkudelski 2001). Recently, \n\nanother toxicity mechanism has been proposed in which STZ inhibits the \n\nactivity of N-acetyl-?-D-glucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase), the enzyme that \n\nremoves N-acetylglucosamine from proteins, hence contributing to increase \n\nprotein glycosilation in ? cells (Konrad et al. 2001; He et al. 2009). Moreover, \n\nO-GlcNAcase from pancreatic islets was found to be more sensitive to STZ \n\nthan that from other tissues (Konrad et al. 2001), providing supporting \n\nevidence for the ? cell selectivity of STZ. \n\nThe STZ-induced type 1 diabetic rat model displays the typical \n\nsymptoms of type 1 DM present in humans (e.g. polyphagia, polydipsia and \n\npolyuria). Blood glucose levels rapidly increase within hours after the \n\nadministration of a diabetogenic dose of STZ to adult rats, in parallel with a \n\ndecrease in insulin levels (Burcelin et al. 1995). Food and water consumption \n\nincrease in the first days and remain elevated for several weeks while \n\nweight gain is restrained (Wei et al. 2003). Hence, the STZ-diabetic rat is a \n\nvery popular model for experimental type 1 DM and is used recurrently in \n\naddressing the pathophysiology of the disease and in characterizing the \n\nefficacy of antidiabetic interventions (e.g. Ferrannini et al. 1990; Akirav et al. \n\n2004; Iwasaki et al. 2005; Lo et al. 2006; Suthagar et al. 2009).  \n\n\n\n6|Chapter 1 \n \n\n1.2 Overview of hepatic glucose and lipid \nmetabolism  \n\nFollowing meal digestion in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), nutrients \n\nare absorbed to the blood and reach the liver via the portal vein. This event \n\nis consonant with the release of insulin from the pancreatic ? cells into the \n\nportal vein, in response to glucose (and also protein and fatty acid) \n\nstimulation (Utzschneider et al. 2004). Under physiological conditions, the \n\nliver extracts 50-80% (Radziuk et al. 1994; Utzschneider et al. 2004) of portal \n\nvein insulin with the remainder reaching the systemic circulation. In the \n\nliver, insulin suppresses hepatic glucose production, which is active in the \n\npost absorptive or fasted state, and stimulates pathways for glucose \n\ndisposal and storage as glycogen and lipids. The liver alone accounts for the \n\nextraction of one third of a glucose load, muscle and fat for another third \n\nand brain and red blood cells for the remaining third (Cherrington 1999). \n\nOn the other hand, during fasting, the brain takes up about 80% of the \n\nglucose produced endogenously (Baron et al. 1988).  \n\n \n\n1.2.1 Glucose disposal and storage \n\nFigure 1 depicts the fates of glucose in the liver, in the postprandial \n\nor absorptive state. Glucose enters the hepatocyte through the Glut-2 \n\ntransporter, which is primarily expressed in the liver but is also present in \n\nkidney, intestine and pancreatic ? cells (Nordlie et al. 1999). Other dietary \n\nsugars like fructose or galactose also enter the liver through this transporter. \n\nThe transport of glucose via Glut-2 is bidirectional; moreover Glut-2 has low \n\naffinity and high capacity for glucose facilitating both the efflux and uptake \n\nof glucose in the range of concentrations necessary for glucose homeostasis \n\n(Nordlie et al. 1999). \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nIntroduction|7 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1  Schematic overview of the pathways for glucose disposal in the liver. Glycolysis, \n\nglycogenesis and de novo lipogenesis are presented and the key enzymes and \nglucose transporter involved are shown. For simplicity, some reactions in the \npathways are omitted (discontinued arrows).

In the liver, the control of GK \n\nactivity is dependent in a regulatory protein (GKRP) that acts as an \n\ninhibitory competitor in regards to glucose (Agius 2008). It is widely \n\naccepted that under basal conditions of 5.5 mM glucose concentration, GK \n\nexists sequestered in the nucleus in association with GKRP and that GK is \n\nreleased and translocated to the cytosol under high glucose or low fructose \n\nconcentration (Agius et al. 1993; de la Iglesia et al. 1999; Agius 2008). \n\nFructose-1-phosphate, whose intrahepatic levels increase in the postprandial \n\nstate, binds to GKRP causing the weakening of its interaction with GK, and \n\nthis results on the release of the active GK (Iynedjian 2009). On the other \n\nhand, in the postabsorptive state, fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) binds to GKRP \n\nstimulating its interaction with GK (Iynedjian 2009), which is consequently \n\nimported back to the nucleus. This way GK degradation is prevented and at \n\nthe same time a large stable pool of the enzyme is conserved for recruitment \n\nupon refeeding (Newgard 2004).  \n\nGlucose uptake through Glut-2 is coordinated with its \n\nphosphorilation by GK (Figure 1) resulting in the formation of G6P, which \n\ncan be directed to glycogen synthesis or glycolysis. \n\n \n\n1.2.1.1 Glycogen synthesis \n\n Glycogen deposition occurs in the liver after a meal. The hepatic \n\nglycogen stores represent an important source of glucose to be released in \n\nthe fasted state by the liver so that plasma glucose levels remain within the \n\nphysiological range and whole-body energetic demands are fulfilled. Net \n\nglycogen synthesis results from the interplay between glycogen synthase \n\n(GS) and glycogen phosphorylase (GP) activities. In the biogenesis of \n\nglycogen, G6P is first converted to glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) by \n\nphosphogluco isomerase and subsequently to uridine diphosphate glucose \n\n\n\nIntroduction|9 \n\n(UDPG) by UDPG pyrophosphorylase. Glycogen synthase then adds \n\nglucose residues from the UDPG donor to the growing glycogen molecule \n\nvia ?-1,4 bonds. \n\nThe formation of glycogen is intimately related to glucose \n\nphosphorylation by GK. In fact, glycogen synthesis is sensitive to increases \n\nin GK activity secondary to glucose-induced translocation of GK (Agius et \n\nal. 1996). Furthermore, when GK translocates to the cytosol it is directed to \n\nthe plasma membrane in a way that allows the coupling of glucose \n\nphosphorylation with glycogen synthesis (Jetton et al. 2001). The fact that \n\nGK overexpression enhances glycogen deposition (O'Doherty et al. 1996; \n\nSeoane et al. 1999; Morral et al. 2004), further demonstrates the dependence \n\nof glycogen synthesis on GK. The product of the GK reaction, G6P, is not \n\nonly a precursor to glycogen but also a regulator itself of GS activity. \n\nHepatic GS exists in an inactive form in the cytosol and it is activated and \n\ndirected to the periphery of the cell via G6P stimulation (Ferrer et al. 2003). \n\nThe binding of G6P to the phosphorylated (inactive) isoform of GS, causes a \n\nconformational change that makes it a better substrate for protein \n\nphosphatases, which then convert the enzyme to the active \n\n(dephosphorylated) isoform (Villar-Palasi et al. 1997; Ferrer et al. 2003). \n\nInsulin stimulates GS by increasing the protein phosphatase activity \n\n(Khandelwal et al. 1977; Newgard et al. 2000). The activity of GP, which \n\ncatalyzes the breakdown of glycogen to G1P molecules, is also regulated by \n\nphosphorylation in a coordinated fashion with GS, with the \n\ndephosphorylated isoform being less active than the phosphorylated (Ferrer \n\net al. 2003).  \n\nThe direct conversion of glucose to glycogen via GK and GS \n\ncoordinated fluxes does not account for the whole of glycogen deposition in \n\nthe absorptive state and a significant contribution from gluconeogenic \n\nprecursors is required for efficient glycogen synthesis to occur (Newgard et \n\nal. 1983; Katz et al. 1984; Newgard et al. 1984). This latter route is known as \n\nthe indirect pathway, where glucose is initially metabolized to 3-carbon \n\nintermediates followed by gluconeogenic re-synthesis into hexose \n\n\n\n10|Chapter 1 \n \n\nphosphate (Figure 2). This route also allows non-hexose precursors such as \n\nglycerol or gluconeogenic amino acids to be converted to glycogen. The \n\nrelative contributions of both pathways depend on the nutritional and \n\npathophysiological status of the organism, with the indirect pathway \n\ncontribution to glycogen synthesis increasing with fasting (Shulman et al. \n\n1990; Hellerstein et al. 1995), type 1 DM (Hwang et al. 1995) or GK deficiency \n\n(Velho et al. 1996). \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2  Pathways for glycogen synthesis in the liver. By the direct pathway (orange \n\narrow) glucose is converted to glycogen via glucokinase and glycogen synthase \ncoordinated activities. Alternatively, glucose can be first metabolized to 3-carbon \nintermediates (mostly in the muscle) that are used in the liver to generate G6P for \nglycogen synthesis via the indirect pathway (blue arrow).

The first step in the \n\nglycolytic pathway is the highly regulated phosphorylation of glucose to \n\nG6P by GK, already overviewed. This reaction, together with the conversion \n\nof F6P to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) catalyzed by phosphofructokinase \n\n(PFK) and the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate \n\ncatalyzed by pyruvate kinase (PK) constitute the irreversible steps in \n\nglycolysis. The energy charge of the cell, as well as allosteric and \n\ntranscriptional processes contribute to control the flux thourgh PFK and PK. \n\nBriefly, PFK and PK are stimulated by insulin, glucose and products from \n\nits early metabolism, while a high ratio of ATP to adenosine diphosphate \n\n(ADP) plus adenosine monophosphate decreases the activity of those \n\nenzymes (Newgard 2004).  \n\nThe most important activator of hepatic PFK is fructose-2,6-\n\nbisphosphate (F2,6P2), which is degraded (to F6P and inorganic phosphate) \n\nand regenerated (from F6P and inorganic phosphate) by the bifunctional \n\nenzyme, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase. In the fed \n\nstate, xylulose-5-phosphate derived from glucose metabolization via the \n\npentose phosphate pathway stimulates protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) that \n\ndephosphorylates the bifunctional enzyme, favoring its kinase activity and \n\nthe formation of F2,6P2 (Newgard 2004). Experiments in fasted rats showed \n\nthat hepatic levels of F2,6P2 start to increase several hours after glucose \n\nadministration or refeeding, when glycogen stores in the liver are near to \n\nreplenishment (Kuwajima et al. 1984; Kuwajima et al. 1986; Holness et al. \n\n1988; Jin et al. 2003). Hence, under refeeding circumstances, stimulation of \n\nthe glycolytic flux occurs after that of glycogen synthesis. Moreover, a \n\npositive correlation was observed between hepatic glycogen levels and the \n\nlipogenic rate after chow refeeding (Holness et al. 1988). Accordingly, when \n\nhepatic glycogen is depleted in humans by dietary intervention, excessive \n\ncarbohydrate intake is disposed by high glucose oxidation rates and de novo \n\nlipid synthesis only after glycogen stores become saturated (Acheson et al. \n\n\n\n12|Chapter 1 \n \n\n1988). On the other hand, under natural feeding conditions, F2,6P2 levels \n\nrise in parallel with glycogen in the liver (Bois-Joyeux et al. 1986) suggesting \n\nthe sequence of events may not be the same as in refeeding conditions.  \n\nAfter the glycolytic phase, pyruvate enters the mitochondria and is \n\noxidized to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) by pyruvate dehydrogenase \n\nmultienzyme complex (PDH). This reaction links glycolysis to the \n\ntricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) and de novo lipogenesis (DNL). The \n\nactivity of PDH is ruled by posphorylation (inhibition)-dephosphorylation \n\n(stimulation) mechanisms and inhibited by the end products acetyl-CoA \n\nand nicotinamide adenine dinucleotine in the reduced form (NADH) \n\n(Strumi?o 2005). In rats, starvation, DM and low carbohydrate diet result in \n\nthe inactivation of PDH whereas insulin and high carbohydrate loads \n\nactivate PDH (Randle 1998). Furthermore, a decrease in circulating non-\n\nesterified fatty acids (NEFA) is observed under those conditions (high \n\ninsulin, low glucagon). Since the activity of PDH is inhibited by increased \n\nmitochondrial levels of acetyl-CoA and NADH from NEFA metabolism \n\n(Randle 1998; Holness et al. 2003), reduced NEFA levels permit more PDH \n\nflux and a greater potencial for glycolytic acetyl-CoA generation. In rats, the \n\ndecrease in hepatic DNL rate during fasting (decline in insulin and glucose \n\nlevels) is accompanied by a progressive reduction of PDH activity (Holness \n\net al. 1990). In contrast, the flux through PDH relative to that of the TCA \n\ncycle is increased under simultaneous hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia \n\nconditions (Alves et al. 2011).  \n\nThe \u201cfirst\u201d reaction in the TCA cycle is the condensation of acetyl-\n\nCoA with oxaloacetate (OAA) to yield citrate, catalyzed by citrate synthase. \n\nCitrate is common to both pathways downstream acetyl-CoA formation. \n\nAlternatively to following the TCA cycle reactions, citrate can be exported \n\nto the cytosol where citrate lyase (CL) reconverts it to acetyl-CoA, which can \n\nbe used in DNL, and OAA that returns to the mitochondria in the form of \n\neither malate or pyruvate. The cytosolic conversion of OAA to malate and \n\nfurther to pyruvate requires the sequential activities of malate \n\ndehydrogenase and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotine phosphate (NADP)-\n\n\n\nIntroduction|13 \n\nmalic enzyme. The latter reaction provides the majority of reducing \n\nequivalentes for DNL in the form of reduced NADP (NADPH). The \n\nremainder is produced in the pentose phosphate pathway by the activities \n\nof glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and 6-phosphogluconate \n\ndehydrogenase (6PGDH). \n\nIn addition to glycolytically-derived pyruvate, acetyl-CoA molecules \n\nfor the lipogenic pathway may be produced from amino acid catabolism, \n\nfatty acid oxidation or acetate from intestinal fermentation. Malonyl \n\ncoenzyme A (malonyl-CoA) is formed by the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA \n\ncatalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Malonyl-CoA is a physiological \n\ninhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) (Ruderman et al. 1999), \n\nwhich transports fatty acids from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix for \n\n? oxidation. In this way, fatty acids from DNL are directed to esterification \n\nresulting on the synthesis of triglycerides (TGs).  \n\nIn humans, under normal conditions, daily hepatic DNL accounts \n\nonly for a minor fraction of TG synthesis (3-7%) in the liver but this \n\ncontribution is increased (up to 32%) by dietary (e.g. fructose, low fat-high \n\ncarbohydrate diets) or hormonal intervention (e.g. insulin) (Hellerstein et al. \n\n1996). In rodents, the contribution of DNL to the hepatic TGs ranges from \n\n5% in 5-hour refed rats (Hellerstein et al. 1991) to 11% in 3-day ad libitum fed \n\nrats (Delgado et al. 2009a). Other studies report contributions up to 70% \n\nwhen the experiment was followed for two weeks, using a different rat \n\nspecie (Lee et al. 2000; Bassilian et al. 2002). \n\n \n\n1.2.2 Lipids disposal and storage \n\n1.2.2.1 Brief overview of lipoprotein metabolism \n\nLipids are different from other nutrients since, with the exception of \n\nshort-chain fatty acids, they are not directly delivered to the portal \n\ncirculation upon intestinal absorption. Instead, water-insoluble dietary \n\nlipids are processed within the enterocyte and packed into chylomicrons \n\n\n\n14|Chapter 1 \n \n\nthat are absorbed to the lymphatic circulation prior to reaching the blood. \n\nChylomicrons are part of the specialized family of plasma lipid-carriers, \n\nlipoproteins. These structures are spherical particles composed of a \n\nhydrophobic core (cholesterol esters and TGs) and a hydrophilic surface \n\nmonolayer of phospholipids, cholesterol and apolipoproteins. Lipoproteins \n\nwith distinct functions and compositions arise from the dynamic crosstalk \n\nbetween the liver and peripheral tissues through the bloodstream.  \n\nThe main function of chylomicrons is to transport diet-derived TGs \n\nto the tissues of destiny. After meals, the increase in plasma TGs is largely \n\ndependent on the chylomicron-TGs, although there is also a contribution \n\nfrom very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TGs (Frayn 2002). Chylomicron-\n\nTGs are hydrolyzed by the endothelial enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and \n\nthe resulting fatty acids are taken up by the tissues and stored (adipose \n\ntissue) or used for oxidation (skeletal muscle). Also by LPL activity, VLDL \n\nsecreted by the liver deliver fatty acids to extra-hepatic tissues. Insulin is a \n\npotent activator of LPL, stimulating its expression and activity in the \n\nadipose tissue (Frayn 2002; Verg\u00e8s 2009). Accordingly, in insulin-deficient \n\nmice, LPL activity is reduced hampering the storage of fat in adipocytes \n\n(Pighin et al. 2005). In untreated type 1 diabetic patients, the lack of insulin \n\ncauses hypertriglyceridemia as a consequence of the reduced catabolism of \n\nTG-rich lipoproteins (Verg\u00e8s 2009) and the same is observed in insulin-\n\ndeficient rats (Iwasaki et al. 2005). \n\nWith the further removal of TGs, VLDL remnant particles are \n\nconverted to the cholesterol-enriched intermediate density lipoproteins and \n\nlow density lipoproteins, which supply cholesterol to essentially all cells. \n\nConversely high density lipoproteins (HDL) are responsible for the reverse \n\ntransport of cholesterol to the liver for excretion in the bile. The liver \n\nsecretes these particles as lipid-poor lipoproteins. In the circulation, nascent \n\nHDL receive phospholipids and apolipoproteins from chylomicrons and \n\nVLDL, and take up cholesterol and phospholips from the peripheral tissues \n\n(Verg\u00e8s 2009).  \n\n\n\nIntroduction|15 \n\n1.2.2.2 Hepatic TG dynamics and VLDL metabolism \n\nBesides DNL (see section 1.2.1.2), dietary and lipolytic sources \n\ncontribute to the hepatic TG pool. As chylomicrons travel through the \n\nbloodstream they become depleted on TGs and the remnant particles are \n\ncleared from the blood by the liver through receptor-mediated endocytosis. \n\nHence, dietary TGs reach the liver associated to the remnant chylomicrons. \n\nHepatic lipase hydrolyses TGs from chylomicrons (and also other \n\nlipoproteins) releasing the fatty acids, which are re-esterified and stored as \n\nTGs in intra-hepatic lipid droplets (Sparks et al. 2009). \n\nIn addition, fatty acids from adipose tissue lipolysis transported by \n\nplasma albumin also contribute to the hepatic TG pool. This inflow of NEFA \n\nis particularly high during fasting and decreases rapidly after meals as a \n\nresult of insulin action on suppressing hormone sensitive lipase in the \n\nadipose tissue (Frayn 2002). This event, coupled with the stimulation of LPL \n\ncauses the net storage of TGs in the adipocyte in the postprandial state.  \n\nIn the liver, TGs are packed along with cholesterol into VLDL and \n\nsecreted to the bloodstream. A rate-limiting step in the formation of VLDL \n\nis the transfer of TGs to apolipoprotein B (apoB) by the microsomal transfer \n\nprotein (MTP) (Kamagate et al. 2008). Insulin decreases VLDL secretion \n\n(Huang et al. 2009) by several mechanisms, including a direct inhibition of \n\nMTP gene expression and apoB synthesis (Sparks et al. 2009) and the \n\nsuppression of NEFA release from adipose tissue as discussed above. \n\nHence, and in accordance with the stimulation of DNL and of energy \n\nstorage in general, insulin promotes the accumulation of TGs in the liver \n\n(Huang et al. 2009). \n\n \n\n1.2.3 Glucose production \n\nIn the absence of exogenous glucose, provided by food intake, \n\nplasma glucose levels are maintained via endogenous glucose production \n\n(EGP). The liver is the main organ accounting for EGP but the kidney and \n\n\n\n16|Chapter 1 \n \n\nsmall intestine are also able to produce glucose and release it to the \n\nbloodstream (Mithieux et al. 2004), although their contribution only becomes \n\nsignificant in severe insulinopenic states such as prolonged fasting or \n\ndiabetes (Mithieux et al. 2006). This capacity for glucose output relies on the \n\nactivity of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), the enzyme that catalyzes the \n\ndephosphorylation of G6P to glucose. \n\nIn the liver, G6P can originate from the release of glucosyl units from \n\nhepatic glycogen stores (glycogenolysis) or can be synthesized de novo in the \n\nprocess of gluconeogenesis. In healthy humans the gluconeogenic \n\ncontribution to EGP increases with fasting from 40-55% in the postprandial \n\nstate to 95% from the 42nd hour of fasting and onward (Chandramouli et al. \n\n1997; Roden et al. 2001). Parallel to this, hepatic glycogen stores decrease \n\nlinearly in the first hours of fasting (Petersen et al. 1996) and are nearly \n\ndepleted by the 42nd hour (Roden et al. 2001). \n\nPathways to glucose production are dependent on substrate and \n\nhormonal inputs. The fall of glucose levels and the concomitant increase in \n\nthe glucagon/insulin ratio observed in the fasted state translates into an \n\nincrease in glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis (Lef\u00e8vre 2004).  \n\n \n\n1.2.3.1 Glycogenolysis \n\nAs mentioned in section 1.2.1.1, net glycogen storage or breakdown \n\ndepends on the activities of GS and GP. Those enzymes are regulated by \n\nreciprocal phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanisms. In catabolic \n\nstates such as fasting or stress, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-\n\ndependent protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates GS, inactivating it and \n\nconversely phosphorylates phosphorylase kinase that phosphorylates \n\n(activates) GP (Newgard et al. 2000). In addition, glycogen synthase kinase 3 \n\n(GSK3) is also activated by PKA and contributes to further inactivate GS \n\n(Jope et al. 2004). \n\n\n\nIntroduction|17 \n\n1.2.3.2 Gluconeogenesis \n\nThe regulation of gluconeogenesis mainly occurs at a transcriptional \n\nlevel, in accordance with the slow transition from the fed to fasted state \n\n(Newgard 2004). The first step of gluconeogenesis is the conversion of \n\npyruvate to PEP. This step actually involves the activity of two key \n\nenzymes: pyruvate carboxylase (PC) that generates OAA from pyruvate and \n\nPEP carboxykinase (PEPCK) that converts OAA to PEP. Under fasting \n\nconditions, it is the oxidation of fatty acids that fuels this energetically-\n\nexpensive conversion and at the same time provides allosteric regulators \n\nthat favor it. Namely, acetyl-CoA stimulates PC and along with NADH and \n\nATP (also by-products from the oxidation of fatty acids) inhibit PDH \n\n(Newgard 2004). Furthermore, the binding of glucagon to its cell receptor \n\nresults in the conversion of ATP to cAMP that acts to stimulate the PEPCK \n\ngene expression (Gurney et al. 1994; Newgard 2004). The expression of the \n\nG6Pase gene is also increased by cAMP and, in addition, by variables \n\nassociated with the diabetic condition like hyperglycemia and \n\nhyperlipidemia (Newgard 2004). The gene expression and activity of FBPase \n\nare also increased with fasting or insulinopenic diabetes but the underlying \n\nmechanisms are still unclear (Newgard 2004).  \n\n \n\n1.3 Molecular aspects of insulin signaling \n\n Insulin is a hormone that promotes anabolic processes. In the liver, \n\ninsulin acts to stimulate glucose disposal and storage and inhibit glucose \n\nproduction as generally discussed in the previous sections. These effects are \n\nmediated by changes in enzyme activities or amounts as a consequence of \n\nthe intracellular transduction of insulin\u2019s signal. \n\nWhen insulin binds to its transmembrane receptor elicits a \n\nconformational change that results in the autophosphorylation of the \n\nreceptor, which in turn mediates the phosphorylation of several \n\nintracellular substrate proteins on tyrosine residues (Garvey 2004). The \n\n\n\n18|Chapter 1 \n \n\neffects of insulin on cell function will depend on the substrate proteins \n\ninvolved and on the signaling pathways activated henceforward. Most of \n\ninsulin\u2019s metabolic effects result from a signaling pathway that involves the \n\nphosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins and the \n\nsequential activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt or \n\nprotein kinase B (Akt/PKB).  \n\nThe following section introduces some of the most important \n\nsignaling mechanisms and molecules implicated in insulin\u2019s metabolic \n\neffects in the liver. \n\n \n\n1.3.1 Metabolic effects of insulin signaling in the liver \n\nIn the liver, the PI3K pathway stimulates glycogen synthesis since \n\nAkt/PKB phosphorylates GSK3, inactivating it and hence stimulating GS \n\nactivity (see also section 1.2.3.1) (Peak et al. 1998; Saltiel et al. 2001; Garvey \n\n2004).  \n\nAnother important hepatic metabolic consequence of the Akt/PKB \n\npathway is the phosphorylation of forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) and the \n\nconsequent export of that transcription factor from the nucleus to the \n\ncytosol. By this mechanism, the FoxO1-dependent gene expression of \n\ngluconeogenic enzymes PEPCK and G6Pase is decreased (Foufelle et al. \n\n2002; Garvey 2004; Postic et al. 2004). In addition, phosphorylation of FoxO1 \n\nas a result of insulin signaling also prevents its interaction with peroxisome \n\nproliferative activated receptor ? co-activator 1, which is necessary for the \n\ntranscription of the PEPCK and G6Pase genes (Postic et al. 2004). Moreover, \n\nsince the nuclear activity of FoxO1 also accounts for the expression of MTP \n\nand apoB, insulin inhibition of FoxO1 translates into a decrease of VLDL \n\nsecretion in the liver (Sparks et al. 2009).  \n\nConversely to the inhibition of FoxO1, insulin induces another \n\ntranscription factor, the sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c \n\n(SREBP1c) probably also through the PI3K-Akt/PKB signaling pathway \n\n(Foufelle et al. 2002; Barthel et al. 2003). SREBP1c regulates gene expression \n\n\n\nIntroduction|19 \n\nfor GK, PK and most lipogenic genes, including the ones for fatty acid \n\nsynthase multienzyme complex (FAS), ACC and CL (Foufelle et al. 2002; \n\nGarvey 2004). However, SREBP1c activity alone does not account for the \n\nstimulation of the glycolytic and lipogenic metabolic pathways and, with \n\nthe exception of GK, most of the enzymes involved in those pathways are \n\nalso induced by glucose via the carbohydrate responsive element binding \n\nprotein (ChREBP) (Dentin et al. 2005). Under basal conditions, PKA \n\nphosphorylates ChREBP retaining it in the cytosol; conversely, under high \n\nglucose levels, xylulose-5-phosphate-stimulated PP2A dephosphorylates \n\nChREBP allowing it to migrate to the nucleus (Towle 2005). \n\n \n\n1.4 Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy \nmethods in metabolism \n\nMetabolic phenotyping is emerging in the post-genomics and \n\nproteomics era in the context of linking cell metabolism \u2013 a fundamental \n\nparameter of cell function \u2013 to the DNA information and transcription \n\n(Chikayama et al. 2008). A comprehensive metabolic analysis provides an \n\nintegrate profile of the pathophysiological status that results from the \n\ngenomic, transcriptomic and proteomic variability, and is the basis for the \n\ndevelopment of a new field, metabonomics/metabolomics2 (Lindon et al. \n\n2007; Bain et al. 2009). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a \n\npowerful and versatile technique for the study of cellular, tissue and whole-\n\nbody metabolism. In the context of metabonomics, NMR spectroscopy \n\nrepresents a quantitative, non-destructive tool that requires little sample \n\npreparation for the analysis of complex biological fluids, cells or even intact \n\ntissues. For such samples, a sizable array of metabolites can be identified \n\n                                                      \n2  These two terms are used interchangeably in the scientific community. In its original \ndefinition \u201cmetabonomics\u201d is the quantitative measurement of the dynamic multiparametric \nmetabolic response of living systems to pathophysiological stimuli or genetic modification \nwhile \u201cmetabolomics\u201d is the comprehensive and quantitative analysis of all metabolites in a \nsystem (Lindon et al. 2007). \n\n\n\n20|Chapter 1 \n \n\nand their concentrations measured from a single proton (1H) NMR \n\nspectrum. \n\nMoreover, NMR assessments can be performed in vivo, what \n\nrepresents a major breakthrough relative to the previously-established \n\ninvasive approaches that required needle biopsies and catheterization \n\n(Roden et al. 2001). With in vivo 1H, carbon 13 (13C) and phosphorous 31 \n\nNMR spectroscopy experiments, the metabolic profile of diverse metabolites \n\ncan be determined in several organs includind liver, brain and muscle (e.g. \n\nSinha et al. 2002; Goforth et al. 2003; Gruetter et al. 2003; Lanza et al. 2006; \n\nvan Zijl et al. 2007) and followed in longitudinal studies to assess the \n\ndynamics of metabolite pools. Most interestingly, in the context of hepatic \n\ncarbohydrate metabolism, the quantification of glycogen by in vivo 13C NMR \n\nspectroscopy is used in combination with tracer-based experiments and \n\nplasma turnover measurements providing a comprehensive insight into the \n\nmetabolic fluxes (Roden et al. 1996; Bischof et al. 2002; Petersen et al. 2004).  \n\n \n\n1.4.1 The use of stable isotopes to trace carbohydrate and lipid \n\nmetabolism \n\nBy definition, a metabolic tracer is a substance used to follow the \n\nbiological transformation of an endogenous substrate (tracee). The tracer \n\nmust be metabolically indistinguishable from the tracee but at the same time \n\npossess a unique property allowing for its detection. In the large majority of \n\ncases, tracers consist of synthetic substrate molecules where one or more of \n\nthe atoms have been substituted by rare isotopes that can be detected by a \n\nspecific technique. Stable isotopes such as 13C and deuterium (2H) can be \n\ndetected by NMR and mass spectrometry and these approaches have \n\nlargely replaced earlier tracer studies based on their radioactive \n\ncounterparts (carbon 14 and tritium). In addition to being safer, stable \n\nisotope analytical methods have a key advantage over radioactive tracer \n\ndetection in that they inherently provide positional labeling information. \n\nEquivalent information may be obtained with radioactive tracers, but it \n\n\n\nIntroduction|21 \n\ninvolves highly tedious carbon-by-carbon degradation of the metabolite of \n\ninterest. \n\nIsotopic labels at specific positions of any given precursor substrate \n\nare transferred to metabolic intermediates and products in a highly specific \n\nmanner during the biochemical reactions within the organism. Thus, the \n\nfate of the labeled precursor is highly predictable depending on the \n\nmetabolic pathway that it transverses. With NMR analysis of the product \n\nlabeling pattern, different metabolic routes can be discriminated and \n\nmeasured.  \n\n \n\n1.4.1.1 [U-13C]glucose as a tracer to glucose and glycogen metabolism \n\nGlucose kinetics can be addressed by enriching the plasmatic pool \n\nwith [U-13C]glucose. This is easily achieved by supplementing a meal or a \n\nglucose solution with the tracer or even by delivering it directly to the \n\nbloodstream in more invasive infusion procedures. When [U-13C]glucose \n\nenters the disposal pathways, two important events occur to the plasmatic \n\npool, (i) it becomes less enriched with the tracer as it is taken up by the cells \n\nand (ii) other 13C-enriched glucose isotopomers 3  arise from the \n\nmetabolization (or recycling) of the tracer. The relative contribution of each \n\nisotopomer to the plasma glucose pool can be disclosed by 13C NMR \n\nspectroscopy and this information provides insight into the dynamics of \n\nwhole-body glucose metabolism, which is sensitive to several \n\npathophysiological conditions. \n\nUptake of [U-13C]glucose is followed by its metabolization within the \n\ncells. For example, in the liver, the direct conversion of the tracer into \n\nglycogen renders [U-13C]UDPG and glycogen composed of [U-13C]glucosyl \n\nresidues. If, on the other hand, glucose follows the glycolytic pathway, this \n\nresults in the formation of two molecules of [U-13C]pyruvate. The glycolytic \n\n                                                      \n3 Contraction of the words isotope and isomer, refers to molecules that differ one from the \nother solely by their isotopic composition. For example, considering the glucose molecule \nand the 13C isotope, each carbon may be 12C or 13C. Since there are 6 carbons in glucose, there \nare 26 = 64 possible isotopomers. \n\n\n\n22|Chapter 1 \n \n\nprocessing is especially active in peripheral tissues like the muscle, where, \n\nunder anaerobic conditions, pyruvate is further converted to lactate by \n\nlactate dehydrogenase. Lactate from muscle glycolysis then enters the \n\nbloodstream and is taken up by the liver, where it is reconverted to \n\npyruvate that serves as a gluconeogenic substrate for glucose production. \n\nThis sequence of events is named the Cori cycle. As a result of the glucose \n\nresynthesis from [U-13C]pyruvate, other isotopomers arise. In this process \n\nthere is scrambling of the labeling due to pyruvate recycling (pyruvate ? \n\nOAA ? PEP ? pyruvate) and racemization at the OAA/fumarate inter-\n\nconversion. In consequence, several possible populations of glucose \n\nisotopomers from [U-13C]pyruvate can be predicted (Mendes et al. 2006) but \n\n[1,2-13C2]- and [1,2,3-13C3]glucose account for the majority (Perdigoto et al. \n\n2003), and the isotopomer analysis is thus much simplified. Moreover, those \n\nisotopomers can be distinguished from the [U-13C]glucose tracer by analysis \n\nof the C1 resonance in the 13C NMR spectrum of a glucose derivative \n\n(method applied in chapters 2 and 3).  \n\n \n\n1.4.1.2 Deuterated water as a tracer to glucose and glycogen \n\nmetabolism \n\nDeuterated water (2H2O) is a relatively inexpensive tracer. Upon \n\nadministration it freely distributes within the tissues and rapidly \n\nequilibrates with total body water, thus allowing to follow whole-body \n\nmetabolism (Murphy 2006). Deuterated water is easily administered both to \n\nhumans and animals by adding it to the common drinking water in tracer \n\namounts. Furthermore, 2H2O can be delivered to animals as an i.p. bolus \n\nthat results in a steady state enrichment within 10 minutes (Turner et al. \n\n2003). Additionally, the subjects may be maintained under 2H2O \n\nadministration for several days, making it suited for assessing metabolism \n\nboth in short and long term studies in diverse experimental settings \n\n(Murphy 2006).  \n\n\n\nIntroduction|23 \n\nGlucose-6-phosphate is a common precursor to both glycogen and \n\nglucose. In the presence of 2H2O, G6P is labeled with 2H in several positions \n\ndue to the incorporation of that isotope from body water in exchange and \n\naddition reactions of the G6P production pathways. This labeling is \n\nmaintained in the glucose and glycogen molecules. Thus, a given positional \n2H enrichment in glucose or glycogen reflects the reaction accounting for \n\nincorporation from 2H2O in that position. Moreover, the positional 2H \n\nenrichment quantitatively reflects its respective reaction if isotopic steady \n\nstate has been achieved (which occurs very fast with 2H2O) and the reaction \n\nis complete.  \n\nA large body of studies has been performed in the past 15 years \n\nbased on the 2H2O method and equations established by Landau and co-\n\nworkers (Landau et al. 1995; Landau et al. 1996). The exchange of protons \n\nwith 2H from the 2H2O at the level of the G6P/F6P keto-enolic equilibrium \n\nresults in the enrichment of G6P with 2H in position 2 (Figure 3). Because \n\nthat isomerization is extensive and essentially complete, the G6P pool is \n\nenriched with 2H in position 2 regardless of its origin. Hence, 2H labeling of \n\nposition 2 of glucose is assumed to reflect the total EGP, both via \n\ngluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. In fact, in fasting conditions, when \n\nEGP is the only source of blood glucose, the 2H enrichment in position 2 of \n\nglucose is essentially that of body water both in humans (Landau et al. 1995; \n\nJones et al. 2006a) and rats (Nunes et al. 2009). Likewise, both direct and \n\nindirect pathway precursors of glycogen become enriched with 2H from \n2H2O in position 2. On the other hand, 2H enrichment from 2H2O in position \n\n5 of G6P specifically and quantitatively reflects the contribution of \n\ngluconeogenesis from both pyruvate and glycerol. Incorporation of 2H in \n\nthat position occurs at the level of the triose phosphates isomerization \n\n(Figure 3).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n24|Chapter 1 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 3  Reactions for glucose and glycogen labeling from 2H2O.

This \n\nmethod is based on the mathematics of combinatory probabilities and \n\ndetermines the true precursor enrichment by the analysis of the isotope \n\ndistributions on the polymer end-product. For example, plasma VLDL \n\nisotopomer abundances can be quantified by mass spectrometry following \n\nthe administration of 13C-enriched acetate (Hellerstein et al. 1996) or 2H2O \n\n(Murphy 2006) and the precursor (intracellular acetyl-CoA) enrichment \n\ndetermined by MIDA provides an estimation of hepatic DNL. \n\nAlternatively, the hepatic pool of acetyl-CoA can be sampled in vivo by the \n\nadministration of a xenobiotic metabolized in the liver by acetylation. This \n\nstrategy was developed by Hellerstein and colleagues (Hellerstein 1991; \n\nHellerstein et al. 1991) and reports DNL values comparable with those from \n\nMIDA analysis.  \n\nIn the process of lipid biosynthesis, the incorporation of hydrogens (or \n\ndeuterium) from the body water into the fatty acid molecule may occur \n\ndirectly or indirectly, through NADPH in the reduction steps or via the \n\nlabeling of precursor acetyl-CoA. The methyl groups of the fatty acids in \n\nthe TG molecule are derived from acetyl-CoA (Murphy 2006). Hence, a \n\nsimple method for the quantification of DNL consists in determining the \n2H enrichment in the methyl group of TGs (by 2H NMR analysis of hepatic \n\nlipids) and relate that to the precursor enrichment in the presence of 2H2O \n\n(Delgado et al. 2009a).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n|27 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2                                                                                                     \nGLUCOSE PRODUCTION AND HEPATIC GLYCOGEN SYNTHESIS \nDURING A CARBOHYDRATE CHALLENGE IN RATS \u2013 EFFECT OF \n\nGALACTOSE \n\n2.1 Introduction \n\nThe study of hepatic glycogen synthesis by the direct and indirect \n\npathways is of central importance in the field of metabolic disorders like \n\ndiabetes or obesity. Those contributions can be resolved in humans by \n\nsupplementing a breakfast meal with 13C-enriched glucose and a xenobiotic \n\nglucuronide precursor such as paracetamol (Hellerstein et al. 1986; Delgado \n\net al. 2009b). The 13C enrichment of UDPG, sampled via the urinary \n\nglucuronide, relative to that of 13C-enriched plasma glucose provides a \n\nmeasure of direct and indirect pathway contributions. Alternatively, the \n\nenrichment of UDPG position 5 from ingested 2H2O can be used to \n\ndetermine direct and indirect pathway contributions to glycogenic flux \n\n(Jones et al. 2006a). To date, none of these measurements have accounted for \n\nthe effects of galactose that may be present in the breakfast meal. Although \n\n\n\n28|Chapter 2 \n \n\nit may be a minor component of the total meal carbohydrate intake, the fact \n\nthat it is metabolized by liver (while dietary glucose is mostly metabolized \n\nby peripheral tissues) amplifies its effects on postprandial hepatic \n\ncarbohydrate metabolism. For example, a 300 mL portion of reduced fat \n\nmilk contains about 15 g of lactose or 7.5 g galactose \u2013 about 7.5% of the \n\ntotal carbohydrate from a typical breakfast meal containing ~100 grams of \n\ncarbohydrate. Galactose aside, the liver accounts for about 20%, or 20 grams \n\nof glucose absorption from this meal. In this setting, the contribution of \n\ngalactose to total hepatic carbohydrate uptake is 7.5/27.5 g, or \n\napproximately 27%. \n\nGalactose is metabolized to common intermediates of glucose \n\nmetabolism via the Leloir pathway as shown in Figure 4 (Hellerstein et al. \n\n1988; Niewoehner et al. 1990; Niewoehner et al. 1992; Wehrli et al. 2007). \n\nAfter galactose phosphorylation to galactose-1-phosphate (Gal1P), \n\ngalactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase catalyses the transference of the \n\nUDP moiety from UDPG to Gal1P, producing UDP-galactose (UDPgal) and \n\nG1P. UDPgal is then converted to UDPG by UDP-galactose 4-epimerase. \n\nUDPG may then be converted to glycogen via GS or be metabolized to G1P. \n\nThe extensive equilibration between G1P and G6P coupled to G6Pase \n\nactivity allows the net conversion of galactose to hepatic glucose. \n\nAll tracer measurements of direct and indirect pathway \n\ncontributions to hepatic glycogen synthesis are based on the assumption \n\nthat the labeled G6P precursor of one pathway is diluted by unlabeled G6P \n\ngenerated by the other. Thus, glucose tracers are metabolized to G6P via the \n\ndirect pathway and are assumed to be diluted by G6P molecules generated \n\nby indirect pathway activity so that UDPG enrichment is less than that of \n\nthe glucose precursor. With 2H2O, G6P derived via the indirect pathway is \n\nenriched in the fifth hydrogen to the same level as body water and this \n\nenrichment is assumed to be diluted by direct pathway G6P molecules that \n\nare not enriched in this position. In the presence of galactose, these \n\nassumptions are no longer valid since the conversion of galactose to UDPG \n\n\n\nEffect of galactose during a carbohydrate challenge|29 \n\nrepresents a hitherto undefined capacity for diluting UDPG enrichment \n\nfrom either 13C-glucose or 2H2O tracers.  \n\n \n\n \n \nFigure 4 Schematic representation of pathways for glycogen synthesis and endogenous \n\nglucose production in the liver during a mixed glucose/galactose load.

Animals were subjected to a 12 hour light/12 hour dark cycle \n\n(lights on from 7 am to 7 pm) with free access to a standard chow diet (60% \n\ncarbohydrates, 16% proteins, 3% lipids). At least five days of acclimatization \n\nwere allowed before any intervention was performed on the animals.  \n\n \n\n2.2.1.2 Animal protocols \n\nRats (231 \u00b1 5g) were fasted for 24 hours with free access to water. In \n\norder to attain proper body water 2H2O enrichment animals were injected 2 \n\nmL of 2H2O in the i.p. cavity at the beginning of the study. Carbohydrate \n\nloads were also dissolved in 2H2O. A glucose load (2 g/kg, approximately \n\n2.6 mmol per animal) enriched to 10% with [U-13C]glucose was \n\nadministered to the first group (GLU, N = 6) by oral gavage. The second \n\ngroup (GLU+GAL, N = 6) was administered the same dose of carbohydrate \n\nas glucose-galactose mixture consisting of 9 equivalents of glucose and 1 \n\nequivalent of galactose. The glucose fraction was enriched to 10% with [U-\n13C]glucose while the galactose fraction was enriched to 10% with [1-\n13C]galactose. After administering the carbohydrate loads, plasma glucose \n\nwas monitored from tail tip samples every 15 minutes until 180 minutes \n\nwith an Accu-check Aviva (Roche, Portugal) glucometer. At 180 minutes, \n\nanimals were anesthetized by injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) in the i.p. \n\ncavity, the abdominal cavity was opened and ~5 mL of blood was collected \n\n\n\nEffect of galactose during a carbohydrate challenge|31 \n\nfrom the abdominal aorta. A small blood sample (0.5 mL) was reserved for \n\ndetermination of 2H2O body water enrichment and plasma insulin levels. \n\nThe liver was excised and immediately freeze-clamped in liquid nitrogen. In \n\norder to determine the basal fasting liver glycogen content, 24-hour fasted \n\nanimals (N = 5) were sacrificed without receiving a carbohydrate load. \n\n \n\n2.2.2 Metabolite analyses \n\nWhole blood was immediately treated with ZnSO4 0.15 M (1.5 mL \n\nper mL of blood) and Ba(OH)2 0.15 M (1.5 mL per mL of blood), centrifuged, \n\nand glucose on the supernatant extracted by passing through a sequential \n\ncationic and anionic ion-exchange columns. The effluent was lyophilized \n\nand glucose was derivatized to monoacetone glucose (MAG) as described \n\nbelow. Liver was lyophilized, and then pulverized to a fine powder and \n\nglycogen extracted by treatment with 30% KOH (8 mL per gram of liver dry \n\nweight, gdw) at 70\u00baC for 30 minutes. The mixture was treated with 6% \n\nNa2SO4 (4 mL per gdw) and 99.9% ethanol (to a final concentration of 70%, \n\n25 mL per gdw) and glycogen was allowed to precipitate at 4 \u00baC overnight. \n\nAfter centrifugation, the upper liquid phase was discarded and the solid \n\nresidue dried. The residue was resuspended in 50 mM NaCH3COO pH 4.5, \n\nand 16 units of an aqueous solution of amyloglucosidase from Aspergillus \n\nniger (Sigma-Aldrich, Portugal) added. The sample was incubated at 55 \u00baC \n\novernight, and then centrifuged and the upper liquid collected and \n\nlyophilized. Glucose obtained from liver glycogen enzymatic hydrolysis \n\nwas quantified by a standard assay kit (Invitrogen, Spain). The percent \n\nglycogen synthesized over the experimental period was determined as the \n\ndifference between the quantified glycogen for each animal and the mean \n\nvalue determined for the 24-hour fasted controls relative to the quantified \n\nglycogen. Insulin levels were determined by ELISA enzyme immunoassay \n\naccordingly with the supplier\u2019s instructions (Mercodia, Sweden).  \n\n\n\n32|Chapter 2 \n \n\n2.2.3 Synthesis of the glucose monoacetone derivative \n\nIn order to optimize the signal resolution in the NMR spectra, \n\nglucose was converted into its monoacetone derivative. Briefly, the dried \n\nresidue either from blood or liver glycogen preparations was suspended in \n\n10 mL (liver) or 5 mL (blood) acetone with 4% sulphuric acid. Acetone and \n\nsulphuric acid were enriched with deuterium to 2% as previously described \n\n(Jones et al. 2006b). The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature \n\nto yield diacetone glucose. The acetonation reaction was quenched by \n\nadding 10 mL (liver) or 5 mL (blood) of water and adjusting the pH to 8 \n\nwith 1 M NaHCO3. Following acidification of the solution to pH 2.0 with 1 \n\nM HCl, diacetone glucose was hydrolysed to MAG by incubation at 40 \u00baC \n\nfor 5 hours. The solution pH was then increased to 8 with 1 M NaHCO3 and \n\nthe samples were dried by rotary evaporation under vacuum. MAG in the \n\nresidue was extracted with 4 mL of boiling ethyl acetate. Following \n\nevaporation of ethyl acetate, the residue was saved in a desiccator until \n\nNMR analysis.  \n\n \n\n2.2.4 NMR Spectroscopy \n\nAll spectra were analyzed with the NUTS PC-based NMR spectral \n\nanalysis software (Acorn NMR Inc., USA). The peak areas were quantified \n\nusing the curve fitting or the integration tool and the applied line \n\nbroadening was 0.5 Hz for 1H NMR spectra, 1 Hz for 2H NMR spectra and \n\n0.2 Hz for 13C NMR spectra. \n\n \n\n2.2.4.1 2H NMR analysis of body water  \n\nBody water 2H2O enrichments were determined from plasma by 2H \n\nNMR as described by Jones et al. (Jones et al. 2001) with adaptations. Briefly, \n\n10 \u00b5L of plasma were mixed with 1 mL of acetone. After centrifugation 0.6 \n\nmL of the supernatant was collected and transferred to a 5 mm NMR tube. \n\n\n\nEffect of galactose during a carbohydrate challenge|33 \n\n2H NMR spectra were obtained at 25 \u00baC with a 11.7 T Varian Unity 500 \n\nspectrometer (Agilent, USA) equipped with a 5 mm broadband probe with \n\nthe observe coil tuned to 2H. Proton decoupled 2H NMR spectra were \n\nacquired with a 25\u00b0 pulse, 4 seconds of acquisition time and 8 seconds of \n\npulse delay. The number of scans was 24 and spectra typically looked like \n\nthe one depicted in Figure 5. In order to determine the absolute 2H \n\nenrichment level of plasma samples a calibration curve was prepared from \n\nwater standards enriched with 99% 2H2O from 1.3% to 3.3% (Figure 6).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nFigure 5 2H NMR spectrum showing the resonances for acetone and water.

Proton-decoupled 2H NMR spectra of MAG samples were obtained at \n\n50 \u00baC with two alternative NMR spectrometers, a 11.7 T Varian Unity 500 \n\nequipped with a 5 mm broadband probe and a 14.1 T Varian 600 (Agilent, \n\nUSA) equipped with either a 3 mm or a 5 mm broadband probe. In all cases \n\nthe observe coil was tuned to 2H and fully-relaxed spectra were acquired \n\nwith a 90\u00b0 pulse and 1.7 seconds of recycling time. The collection time \n\nranged from 45 minutes to 12 hours according with sample size. In the \n\nVarian 600 system, field frequency stability was maintained via the Varian \n1H-Scout acquisition sequence.

Proton-decoupled 13C NMR spectra were acquired at 14.1 T with the \n\nVarian 600 spectrometer equipped with a 3 mm broadband probe. Spectra \n\nwere obtained at 25 \u00baC. An acquisition time of 2.5 seconds and a pulse delay \n\nof 0.5 seconds were used and the number of acquisitions ranged from 5,000-\n\n25,000. 1H NMR spectra were obtained in the same spectrometer equipped \n\nwith a 3 mm indirect detection probe.

The \n\nnumber of acquisitions ranged from 22 to 512. \n\nThe 13C enrichment level of MAG carbon 1 (13C1) was determined by \n1H NMR analysis of the hydrogen 1 signal (Figure 7). This resonance \n\nconsists of a central doublet, D (from 1H-1H coupling to hydrogen 2 - 3JHH = \n\n3.8 Hz), representing hydrogens bound to 12C1, and a pair of satellite \n\nmultiplets, SM (from heteronuclear direct 1H-13C coupling to 13C1 \u2013 1JHC = \n\n184.5 Hz; 1H-1H coupling to hydrogen 2, and long range 1H-13C couplings to \n\ncarbons 2 and 3 - nJHC, n>1), representing hydrogens bound to 13C1. The 13C1 \n\nenrichment level was estimated as the intensity of the SM divided by the \n\ntotal resonance intensity i.e. SM + D as follows: \n\n \n\nTotal 13C enrichment ?%? ? 100 ? \nSM\n\nSM?D \n\n\n\n36|Chapter 2 \n \n\n \n \nFigure 7 1H NMR spectrum of a MAG sample enriched with 13C1 isotopomers.

The expansion for one of the satellite \nmultiplets is also shown. \n\n \n\nThe fractional contribution of [1-13C]-, [1,2-13C2]-, [1,2,3-13C3]- and [U-\n13C]hexose isotopomers to the 13C1 enrichment of MAG was determined \n\nfrom analysis of the carbon 1 multiplet signal in the 13C NMR spectrum as \n\nfollows. The 7-line multiplet (Figure 10) can be resolved into a singlet \n\ncomponent (C1S), representing [1-13C]MAG, a doublet component (C1D) \n\nrepresenting the sum of [1,2-13C2]- and [1,2,3-13C3]MAG isotopomers, and a \n\nquartet component (C1Q), representing [U-13C]MAG. The fractional \n\ncontribution of each isotopomer component to the total 13C1 signal (C1 total) \n\nwas calculated by measuring the 13C signal intensity of each component \n\nrelative to that of C1 total. To obtain 13C isotopomer excess enrichments, the \n\nfractional isotopomer contribution to the 13C1 signal was multiplied by the \n\ntotal 13C1 enrichment, as shown below. Since [1-13C]MAG enrichment (but \n\nnot the other isotopomers) has a significant contribution from the 1.1% \n\nnatural abundance 13C, this amount must be subtracted from the estimated \n\n[1-13C]MAG excess enrichment as shown below. \n \n\n?1?13C?MAG ?\nC1S\n\nC1 total ?  total \n13C1 enrichment  1.1% \n\n \n\n6.1 6.0 5.9 5.8 5.7 5.6 PPM\n\nD\n\nSMSM\n\n\n\nEffect of galactose during a carbohydrate challenge|37 \n\n?1,2?13C2? ? ?1,2,3?13C3?MAG ?\nC1D\n\nC1 total  ? total \n13C1 enrichment \n\n \n\n?U?13C?MAG ?\nC1Q\n\nC1 total ? total \n13C1 enrichment \n\n \n\n2.2.5 Metabolic contributions parameters \n\nThe non-hexose precursors or indirect pathway contribution to \n\nhepatic glycogen synthesis includes Cori cycle intermediates from \n\nmetabolism of the glucose load as well as endogenous gluconeogenic \n\nprecursors.

The \n\nbalance represents the direct pathway flux from glucose as shown in \n\nEquation 2.

The \n\nhexose sources are resolved into glucose and galactose precursors while the \n\ngluconeogenic sources are resolved into recycled or indirect pathway \n\ncarbons derived from the load and endogenous gluconeogenic precursors. \n\n\n\n38|Chapter 2 \n \n\nSince the fraction of galactose in the load was 10% enriched with [1-\n13C]galactose, the percent contribution of galactose to total hepatic glycogen \n\nwas estimated as the enrichment level of [1-13C]MAG multiplied by 10 with \n\ncorrection for the pre-existing residual unlabeled glycogen fraction (RG), as \n\nshown in Equation 3. The RG fraction was determined as the amount of \n\nresidual glycogen measured in 24-hour fasted rats divided by the hepatic \n\nglycogen level at the end of each of the tracer load administrations. As for \n\n[1-13C]MAG, it was assumed that the enrichment levels of [U-13C]MAG \n\nderived from glycogen reflect the direct contribution from load glucose. \n\nSince enrichment of load glucose with [U-13C]glucose was also 10%, its \n\ncontribution to hepatic glycogen was estimated as being 10 times [U-\n13C]MAG enrichment, with correction for RG as shown in Equation 4. \n \nEquation 3 \n\nLoad galactose ?%? ? ?1?13C?MAG ? 10 ?\n1\n\n1  RG      \n \nEquation 4 \n\nLoad direct pathway glucose ?%? ? ?U?13C?MAG ? 10 ?\n1\n\n1  RG \n \n\nThe [1,2-13C2]- and [1,2,3-13C3]MAG isotopomer pair are assumed to \n\nbe derived by gluconeogenic recycling of the glucose load via the Cori cycle \n\nand/or hepatic indirect pathway (Perdigoto et al. 2003; Mendes et al. 2006; \n\nSena et al. 2007). In addition to the factor of 10 to account for the 10% [U-\n13C]glucose precursor enrichment in the load, these isotopomer levels were \n\nmultiplied by an additional factor of 1.5 to account for dilution at the level \n\nof the hepatic TCA cycle (Mendes et al. 2006), and corrected for residual \n\nunlabeled glycogen as shown in Equation 5.

In both metabolites the 2H enrichment \n\nlevel of position 2 (2H2) was significantly lower than that of body water. \n\nThis is due to the presence of unlabeled hepatic glycogen that was not \n\ncompletely depleted during the fasting period in the liver and of glucose \n\nfrom the oral load that remains in the blood at the end of the test. In the case \n\nof blood glucose the dilution effect caused by load glucose can completely \n\naccount for the lower 2H2 enrichment of glucose in both experimental \n\ngroups (see section 2.3.6). However, the dilution from residual glycogen \n\ndoesn\u2019t completely account for the reduced 2H2 enrichments observed in \n\nhepatic glycogen, especially in the GLU+GAL group (see section 2.3.5). \n\nMoreover, in the GLU+GAL group the 2H2 enrichment in hepatic glycogen \n\ntended to be lower (p = 0.06) than that in blood glucose demonstrating that \n\nthe presence of galactose provides an additional dilution of the 2H2 \n\nenrichment in glycogen.  \n\n \n\n2.3.4 13C enrichments and isotopomer analysis \n\nThe oral glucose or glucose + galactose loads enriched to 10% with \n\n[U-13C]glucose and [1-13C]galactose provided sufficient 13C enrichment of \n\nblood glucose and hepatic glycogen to generate 1H and 13C NMR spectra \n\nwith acceptable 13C-signal intensities as shown in Figure 10. Thus, it was \n\npossible to precisely quantify 13C isotopomers from both [U-13C]glucose and \n\n[1-13C]galactose precursors. The 13C fractional enrichments and isotopomer \n\nlevels derived by NMR analysis are shown in Table 2. \n\nTotal glycogen 13C1 excess enrichment was not different between \n\nGLU and GLU+GAL groups, in agreement with the similar net glycogen \n\nsynthesis amounts observed for the two groups by enzymatic \n\nmeasurements. The GLU group had no detectable excess enrichment from \n\n[1-13C]MAG isotopomer, in accordance with previous findings (Perdigoto et \n\nal. 2003; Mendes et al. 2006; Sena et al. 2007) while the GLU+GAL group had \n\n\n\n46|Chapter 2 \n \n\nsignificant excess enrichment of [1-13C]MAG, reflecting the direct \n\ncontribution of load galactose to hepatic glycogen. Excess enrichment levels \n\nof multiply-enriched glucose isotopomers ([1,2-13C2]- + [1,2,3-13C3]- and [U-\n13C]MAG), which could not have been derived from [1-13C]galactose and \n\ntherefore reflect only the contribution of load glucose metabolized via \n\nindirect pathway and/or Cori cycle, were significantly reduced in the \n\nGLU+GAL compared to GLU group.  \n\n \nTable 2: 13C Isotopomer enrichment of monoacetone glucose (MAG) derived from hepatic \nglycogen and blood glucose.

Similarly to the \n\nobservations for glycogen-derived MAG, the enrichment levels of the [1-\n13C]MAG isotopomer in the GLU group were very close to the natural \n\nabundance but were significantly higher in the GLU+GAL group. This \n\ndemonstrates that galactose in the load also contributed to blood glucose. \n\nThe excess enrichment levels for the multiply-enriched isotopomers ([1,2-\n13C2]- + [1,2,3-13C3]- and [U-13C]MAG) that reflect the contribution of load \n\nglucose to blood glucose were similar in both groups. \n\n\n\nEffect of galactose during a carbohydrate challenge|47 \n\n2.3.5 Hepatic glycogen synthesis \n\nFor animals that received the simple glucose load, position 2 \n\nenrichment of glycogen was significantly less than that of body water (Table \n\n1). This is due in part to the presence of residual unlabeled glycogen prior to \n\nthe introduction of 2H2O, as already discussed. When this is taken into \n\naccount, the theoretical enrichment of glycogen position 2 (i.e. assuming \n\ncomplete exchange of position 2 hydrogen via G6P/F6P exchange) is ~85 % \n\nthat of body water. The measured enrichment of position 2 was only 73 \u00b1 \n\n5% that of body water indicating that G6P/F6P exchange experienced by \n\nG6P en route to glycogen was extensive but not complete and/or that this \n\ngroup of animals had a higher residual glycogen content compared to the \n\ngroup where residual glycogen was determined. For GLU+GAL animals, \n\nglycogen position 2 enrichment relative to body water was significantly \n\nlower, amounting to only 58 \u00b1 3% of body water 2H. The incorporation of \n\ngalactose into glycogen via UDPG does not involve exchange of position 2 \n\nhydrogen with body water, thus the lower position 2/body water \n\nenrichment ratios observed for the GLU+GAL compared to the GLU group \n\nare consistent with this mechanism.  \n\nFrom the analysis of 2H and 13C enrichment distributions of hepatic \n\nglycogen, the principal sources of hepatic glycogen synthesis for GLU and \n\nGLU+GAL groups were estimated. Conversion of glucose to glycogen via \n\nboth direct and indirect pathways was resolved. Formally, the indirect \n\npathway includes intra-hepatic metabolism of glucose to glycogen via 3-\n\ncarbon intermediates as well as glucose metabolized via the Cori cycle. The \n\nCori cycle can be considered as an indirect pathway where the glycolytic \n\nphase (glucose ? pyruvate) occurs in peripheral tissues and the \n\ngluconeogenic phase (pyruvate ? G6P) occurs in the liver. The direct \n\npathway involves the conversion of plasma glucose to glycogen via hexose \n\nintermediates (Figure 4). Glucose absorbed from the oral load as well as \n\nunlabeled circulating glucose existing prior the carbohydrate administration \n\ncontributes to the direct pathway. In addition to direct and indirect \n\ncontributions of the load carbohydrates, the glycogenic contribution of \n\n\n\n48|Chapter 2 \n \n\nendogenous gluconeogenic precursors that were not derived from glucose \n\nrecycling was also measured.  \n\nFor the GLU group, the direct pathway contribution from the load, \n\nas calculated from the dilution of [U-13C]glucose (Equation 4), accounted for \n\nless than one-third of all sources, see Table 3, matching the observations \n\nfrom Shulman et al. in a similar experimental setting (Shulman et al. 1985). \n\nThe direct pathway contribution estimated by the 2H2O method was in \n\nexcellent good agreement with that estimated by 13C isotopomer analysis \n\n(Table 4). Indirect pathway flux was dominated by unlabeled endogenous \n\ngluconeogenic precursors while indirect pathway/Cori cycle metabolism of \n\nthe load glucose were subsidiary contributors as seen by the low abundance \n\nof [1,2-13C2]- plus [1,2,3-13C3]glucose isotopomers. \n\nWhen 10% of the oral glucose load was substituted by galactose, \n\nthere were no significant changes in net glycogen synthesis, but glycogen \n\nsources were significantly modified. Although representing only 10% of the \n\noral carbohydrate load, the galactose contributed about one-quarter of net \n\nhepatic glycogen synthesis. The 13C NMR analysis of glycogen-derived \n\nMAG indicates that the conversion of galactose to hepatic glycogen \n\ndisplaced contributions from both direct and indirect pathways of load \n\nglucose, but had no significant effect on the apparent endogenous \n\ngluconeogenic contribution to glycogen synthesis (Table 3). \n\n \nTable 3: Percent contributions of various sources to hepatic glycogen synthesis 3 hours after \nthe carbohydrate challenge, as determined by the 13C isotopomer analysis of glycogen-\nderived monoacetone glucose.

In the GLU group \n\nthis contribution was 75 \u00b1 7%. That EGP accounted for such a large majority \n\nof plasma glucose under these conditions is surprising, since the glucose \n\nload would have been expected to suppress hepatic glucose output.

In this group \n\nof animals, the contribution of recycled glucose and endogenous \n\ngluconeogenic precursors was essentially the same as in the glucose-fed \n\n\n\nEffect of galactose during a carbohydrate challenge|51 \n\nrats. The combined contributions from glycogen and galactose were similar \n\nto that of galactose by itself (see Table 5 and Table 6). These observations \n\nindicate that by 3 hours after the carbohydrate load, galactose that had been \n\nmetabolized to G6P did not contribute significantly to hepatic glucose \n\noutput and plasma glucose levels. \n\n \n\n2.4 Discussion \n\n2.4.1 Effect of galactose on direct and indirect pathway \n\nestimates with [U-13C]glucose and 2H2O tracers \n\nIn this study, sources of hepatic glycogen synthesis following a load \n\nof pure glucose were quantified and compared with those following a load \n\nwhere 10% of the glucose was replaced by galactose. This proportion of \n\ngalactose and glucose is representative of a breakfast meal containing a \n\nglass of skimmed milk \u2013 a standard source of protein for experimental \n\nbreakfast meals. Given the rapid digestion of lactose and the fact that \n\ngalactose is efficiently extracted and utilized by the liver, any effects of \n\ndietary galactose on direct/indirect pathway measurements are expected to \n\nbe most pronounced in the initial stages of meal absorption. Interestingly, \n\nseveral studies with glucose tracers have shown that direct pathway \n\ncontributions measured immediately after a mixed meal are significantly \n\nsmaller than those measured 4-6 hours later (Shulman et al. 1990; Taylor et \n\nal. 1996). The study of Taylor et al. documents the presence of milk in the \n\nmeal (Taylor et al. 1996), while the study of Shulman et al. (Shulman et al. \n\n1990) refers to a \u201cstandardized breakfast meal\u201d which typically includes \n\nmilk. By comparison, measurements performed during a glucose load \n\ninfusion also show increases in direct pathway contributions over time \n\n(Stingl et al. 2006), but these changes are relatively modest when compared \n\nto those observed with meal studies. The hypothesis set for this study was \n\nthat the uptake and metabolism of galactose from the breakfast meal could \n\n\n\n52|Chapter 2 \n \n\naccount for unexpectedly low values of direct pathway fluxes in the early \n\nstages of absorption.  \n\nThe experimental model adopted was able to recapitulate that effect \n\nby replacing a small fraction of the glucose load with galactose. When the \n\ndirect pathway contribution was measured with [U-13C]glucose, it reported \n\na 30% contribution to hepatic glycogen synthesis for animals administered \n\nwith glucose only. For animals that were administered with the \n\nglucose/galactose mixture, the direct pathway contribution reported by [U-\n13C]glucose was significantly reduced by one-third to 20%. Since net \n\nglycogen accumulation was not significantly different to that of the glucose \n\nonly group, this indicates that galactose competed against the direct \n\npathway for glycogen synthesis. In addition, it was found that the indirect \n\npathway contribution from load glucose was also reduced by one-third \n\n(24% to 16%). However, the apparent contribution from unlabeled \n\ngluconeogenic sources was not significantly altered by galactose \n\nmetabolism. \n\nWith the 2H2O method, the fractional contribution of indirect \n\npathway flux to glycogen synthesis was estimated from the ratio of position \n\n5 enrichment to that of position 2 (H5/H2) and the direct pathway \n\ncontribution is estimated as the balance. Since UDPG derived from \n\ngalactose is not enriched with 2H in any position, this activity will \n\nsystematically dilute all positional 2H enrichments of glycogen hence the \n\nH5/H2 ratio and direct/indirect pathway estimates based on this value will \n\nnot be modified. In the absence of galactose, the direct pathway contribution \n\nobtained by this analysis (32%) matched the 30% estimate obtained with [U-\n13C]glucose tracer. With galactose present, the observed H5/H2 ratio \n\nyielded an identical direct pathway contribution (29%) indicating that this \n\nanalysis was insensitive to the contribution of galactose to glycogen \n\nsynthesis. As predicted, the presence of galactose systematically reduced the \n2H enrichment in all positions of glycogen relative to that of body water. \n\nAssuming that the enrichment in position 2 of glycogen derived from \n\nglucose metabolism is equivalent to that of body water, then in theory, the \n\n\n\nEffect of galactose during a carbohydrate challenge|53 \n\ndifference between the enrichment in position 2 of glycogen and that of the \n\nbody water should correspond to the fraction derived from galactose. \n\nHowever, in this experimental setting this analysis has high uncertainty \n\nsince equilibration of UDPG position 2 and body water hydrogens was \n\nincomplete and the amount of pre-existing unlabeled glycogen could not be \n\ndirectly determined. After adjusting for these parameters, the galactose \n\ncontribution was estimated to be 18%, in fair agreement with the 23% \n\nestimate obtained directly with the [1-13C]galactose tracer.  \n\n \n\n2.4.2 Dominance of the indirect pathway of glycogen synthesis \n\nA key finding of this study was that the indirect pathway was the \n\ndominant source of hepatic glycogen synthesis even after a pure glucose \n\nload. Both [U-13C]glucose and 2H2O tracers reported a ~70% indirect \n\npathway contribution for the animals receiving the glucose only bolus. In a \n\nsimilar oral glucose test performed on 24-hour fasted rats, Jin et al. found an \n\neven higher indirect pathway contribution, accounting for ~90% of post-\n\nload glycogen synthesis (Jin et al. 2003). \n\nIn 24-hour fasted rats, hepatic glycogen is extensively depleted \n\n(Niewoehner et al. 1992; O'Doherty et al. 2000; Jin et al. 2003) therefore the \n\nmaintenance of plasma glucose levels is almost completely dependent on \n\ngluconeogenesis. Following oral administration of a large glucose load, \n\nglucose disposal pathways must be activated while EGP from \n\ngluconeogenesis needs to be suppressed in order to maintain glucose \n\nhomeostasis. In this setting, the diversion of gluconeogenic G6P flux from \n\nglucose to glycogen synthesis is a fast and effective means of suppressing \n\nEGP under these conditions. The observation that a significant fraction of \n\nsynthesized glycogen was derived from endogenous gluconeogenic \n\nprecursors is consistent with this mechanism. Moreover, this flux was \n\nmaintained in the face of competition from galactose suggesting that under \n\nthe conditions of our study, the diversion of gluconeogenic G6P to glycogen \n\nis somehow prioritized over other glycogenic fluxes. Under normal fasting-\n\n\n\n54|Chapter 2 \n \n\nfeeding conditions where the transition from negative to positive \n\nendogenous glucose balance is less abrupt, the gluconeogenic contribution \n\nto glycogen synthesis is present, but it accounts for a smaller fraction (~50%) \n\nof hepatic glycogen synthesis (Chapter 4).  \n\n \n\n2.4.3 Conversion of the hexose load into hepatic glycogen \n\nFor both the glucose and glucose-galactose loads, the synthesis of \n\nhepatic glycogen represented a very minor fraction of the total carbohydrate \n\ndisposal. For example, out of the 2.6 mmol oral glucose load, only 68 \u00b5mol, \n\nor 2.6%, was converted to glycogen by all (direct plus indirect) pathways. \n\nWith glucose and galactose loads, the fractional hepatic extraction of \n\nglucose to glycogen synthesis was significantly further reduced to 1.1%, (i.e. \n\n25 \u00b5mol of the 2.3 mmol load, p &lt;0.01 compared to the fraction from \n\nglucose only load). While the conversion of load galactose (~230 \u00b5mol) to \n\nglycogen was relatively more efficient, it nevertheless accounted for only \n\n7.4% of the total, amounting to ~15 \u00b5mol.  \n\n \n\n2.4.4 Endogenous glucose production during the carbohydrate \n\nchallenge \n\nOne striking feature about the glucose dynamics during this \n\nexperiment was the high contribution of EGP to plasma glucose levels a \n\nshort time after the administration of a large glucose bolus. This was \n\ndetermined by a novel method based on the 2H enrichment level of plasma \n\nglucose position 2 from 2H2O and is dependent on the assumption that there \n\nis negligible cycling between plasma glucose and hepatic G6P. When this \n\ncycle is active, position 2 of plasma glucose can be enriched from 2H2O \n\nindependently of EGP. Glucose/G6P cycling activity has been previously \n\nmeasured as an increased rate of [2-3H]glucose turnover relative to that of \n\n[U-14C]glucose (Dunn et al. 1976). In the 2H2O experiment, glucose/G6P \n\n\n\nEffect of galactose during a carbohydrate challenge|55 \n\ncycling activity would result in unlabeled glucose molecules, including \n\nthose absorbed from the load, being enriched in position 2. This has two \n\nimportant and verifiable consequences on the 2H and 13C enrichment data. \n\nFirst, the EGP contribution to plasma glucose as measured by position 2 \n\nenrichment from 2H2O would be overestimated while the contribution of \n\nabsorbed glucose would be correspondingly underestimated. Therefore, the \n\ngastric glucose contribution as directly reported by the 13C tracer would be \n\nhigher than that estimated by the 2H2O method (indeed if all plasma glucose \n\nunderwent glucose/G6P cycling the apparent gastric glucose contribution \n\nwould be zero). In fact, the gastric contribution reported by the [U-\n13C]glucose tracer (13-16%) was comparable to the fraction of plasma \n\nglucose that was not labeled in position 2 from 2H2O (15-21%). The second \n\nconsequence of glucose/G6P futile cycling would be to reduce the plasma \n\nglucose H5/H2 ratio compared to that of glycogen. Data from this \n\nexperiment show that plasma glucose H5/H2 ratios were higher than those \n\nof glycogen indicating that there was no preferential enrichment of plasma \n\nglucose position 2 from 2H2O by glucose/G6P cycling. Based on these \n\nobservations, it is conclude that in comparison to EGP activity, cycling \n\nbetween plasma glucose and hepatic G6P did not significantly contribute to \n\nplasma glucose enrichment from 2H2O. \n\n \n\n2.4.5 Estimation of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis with \n2H2O \n\nIn these experiments effective glycogen synthesis was accompanied \n\nby a minor contribution of glycogenolysis to blood glucose. The estimation \n\nof glycogenolysis relies on the assumption that glucose derived from \n\nglycogen is enriched with 2H in position 2 but not 5. However, in this \n\nexperiment the majority of glycogen was enriched in both positions 2 and 5, \n\nreflecting the high contribution from three carbon precursors and as a \n\nresult, the calculations based on the 2H labeling pattern of blood glucose \n\nmay underestimate the actual contribution from GP activity. However, since \n\n\n\n56|Chapter 2 \n \n\nthe glycogenolytic contributions were very minor accounting for the \n\nglycogen precursor pool enriched beforehand does not significantly change \n\nthe overall source contributions to plasma glucose5.     \n\n \n\n2.5 Conclusions \n\nThis study demonstrates that a relatively low amount of galactose, \n\nsimilar to what would be expected from a breakfast meal containing dairy \n\nproducts, has a significant effect on direct and indirect pathway estimates \n\nusing current tracer methods. With 13C NMR isotopomer analysis of suitable \n13C-enriched glucose and galactose substrates, the galactose contribution to \n\nglycogen synthesis may be resolved from those of glucose and non-hexose \n\nprecursors. When this is not possible or practical, galactose should be \n\nexcluded from the dietary carbohydrate load.  \n\nIn terms of its overall effects on glucose metabolism and disposal, \n\ngalactose utilization resulted in a decreased contribution of load glucose to \n\nhepatic glycogen synthesis but it had little effect on the clearance of glucose \n\ninto peripheral tissues. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                      \n5 For example, considering that 85% of the hepatic glycogen was synthesized during the 3-\nhour test and that of this fraction ~70% derived from the indirect pathway (i.e. non-hexose \nprecursors), then about 60% of the total hepatic glycogen pool is labeled in both positions 2 \nand 5. The contribution of glycogenolysis to the plasma glucose pool corrected by this factor \nyields ~11% compared to the original ~7% estimation. \n\n\n\n|57 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3                                                                                                     \nSOURCES OF BLOOD GLUCOSE AND HEPATIC GLYCOGEN \nSYNTHESIS DURING A GLUCOSE CHALLENGE IN DIABETIC \n\nRATS \u2013 EFFECT OF A SINGLE INSULIN DOSE. \n\n3.1 Introduction \n\nIn the clinical setting, the OGTT is commonly used to discriminate \n\namong several pre-diabetic conditions although it is not applied to type 1 \n\ndiabetic patients (WHO 2006). Nonetheless, the OGTT is widely used in \n\nexperimental animal models of type 1 DM in the context of evaluating and \n\ncomparing the efficacy of antidiabetic agents. Sometimes, the intravenous or \n\nthe i.p. routes are also used in animals to deliver a glucose load. Generally, \n\nthe aim of the test is to evaluate the glycemic response over time as a \n\nmeasure of glucose disposal. The glucose tolerance test represents a very \n\nstraightforward approach for assessing the antidiabetic efficacy of \n\npharmacological agents (Marti et al. 2001) or dietary supplementation \n\n(Akhani et al. 2004; Lo et al. 2006), for example. \n\n\n\n58|Chapter 3 \n \n\nBy introducing [U-13C]glucose and 2H2O in tracer amounts during \n\nthe OGTT, load glucose clearance, pathways of glucose production and \n\nglycogen synthesis can be disclosed (see Chapter 2). Given that \n\nhyperglycemia in STZ-diabetic rats results in part from deficient glucose \n\ndisposal (Wi et al. 1998) the tracer-enriched OGTT may provide insight on \n\nthe underlying metabolic alterations and how they change with antidiabetic \n\nintervention. To address those questions the OGTT protocol presented in \n\nchapter 2 was performed on STZ-diabetic rats and STZ-diabetic rats \n\npreviously injected with a single dose of insulin so that the effect of the drug \n\non glucose disposal could be evaluated. Insulin was delivered by two \n\ndifferent routes, the traditional s.c. route and the i.p. route, which results in \n\nhigher hepatic insulinization (Mason et al. 2002). Hence, it was anticipated \n\nthat any hepatic-specific insulin action in the context of glucose disposal \n\nwould be detected and characterized under this experimental setting. \n\n \n\n3.2 Materials and methods \n\n3.2.1 Animal studies \n\n3.2.1.1 Animal housing \n\nAs described in section 2.2.1.1. \n\n \n\n3.2.1.2 Animal protocols \n\nRats (270 \u00b1 3 g) were given a 50-65 mg/kg intra-peritoneal injection \n\nof STZ (Sigma-Aldrich, Portugal) dissolved in 10 mM citrate buffer pH 4.5 \n\nto induce diabetes. Animals that did not develop hyperglycemia 1 day after \n\nthe injection were given the same dose of STZ the following days up to a \n\ntotal of 3 doses. Animals were considered diabetic when glycemia was > 250 \n\nmg/dL. \n\n\n\nEffect of insulin during a glucose challenge in diabetic rats|59 \n\nOn the 20th and 21st days following the induction of diabetes, animals \n\nwere fasted for 24 hours and then randomized into three groups. In two of \n\nthe groups, rats were injected insulin (Actrapid\u00ae, Novo Nordisk, kindly \n\ndonated by the Hospitais da Universidade de Coimbra) at a dose of 5 U/kg \n\nto the s.c. route (SC, N = 5) or the i.p. route (IP, N = 5). In the other group \n\n(STZ, N = 5), animals did not receive any injection. Thirty minutes after the \n\ninsulin dose, all animals were administered 2H2O and gavaged a glucose \n\nload enriched to 10% with [U-13C]glucose and glycemia monitored for a 3-\n\nhours period, as described in section 2.2.1.2. The GLU group in the \n\nexperiment described in chapter 2 was used as non-diabetic control for the \n\npresent experiment. In order to determine the basal fasting liver glycogen \n\ncontent a separate group of 24-hour fasted STZ-diabetic animals (N = 5) \n\nwere sacrificed without receiving the glucose load. \n\n \n\n3.2.2 Metabolite analyses \n\nGlucose was extracted from the blood, hepatic glycogen isolated \n\nhydrolyzed to glucose and quantified, as described section 2.2.2. Glucose \n\nwas converted to MAG as described in section 2.2.3.

Experimental groups are as described in \nthe legend of Table 7. \n\n \n\nTable 7 summarizes the performance of the different experiment \n\ngroups subjected to the OGTT. The overall glycemia response during the \n\nOGTT was evaluated by determining the AUC corresponding to t0?180. The \n\nAUC for STZ tended to be higher than that of controls (p &lt;0.1). Both IP and \n\nSC groups displayed significantly lower AUC than STZ. Furthermore, the \n\nAUC for IP was similar to that of controls whereas in the SC group it was \n\nsignificantly lower. This observation is in agreement with higher peripheral \n\nglucose uptake in the case of the s.c. route relative to the i.p., in the first half \n\nof the test, as indicated by the marked decrease in glycemia (Figure 11). \n\nWith time, glycemia for the IP group approached that of the SC and, at the \n\nend of the test, the glycemia values observed for both the IP and SC groups \n\nwere similar and under the physiological range.

Exogenous insulin was quantified from \n\nthe blood collected at the time of sacrifice and there were no significant \n\ndifferences between the values detected for IP and SC.  \n\nAll groups of STZ-diabetic rats displayed higher levels of hepatic \n\nglycogen relative to non-diabetic controls. However, contrarily to what was \n\nobserved for controls (see chapter 2, section 2.3.2) after 24 hours of fasting, \n\nhepatic glycogen content was not nearly depleted in the STZ-diabetic rats, \n\namounting to 373 \u00b1 41 \u00b5mol/gdw. These values were not changed after the \n\nOGTT and when insulin was previously injected to the STZ-diabetic rats \n\n(SC and IP) glycogen levels in the liver were still similar to those of STZ. \n\nThese observations indicate that, for the STZ-diabetic rats, there was no net \n\nglycogen synthesis in the liver in the context of the OGTT, even in the \n\npresence of insulin.  \n\n \n\n3.3.2 13C and 2H metabolite enrichments \n\nThe body water 2H enrichment level was determined from a small \n\nblood sample and was similar among all groups: 2.04 \u00b1 0.06%, STZ; 1.80 \u00b1 \n\n0.10%, IP; 1.98 \u00b1 0.15%, SC; and 2.01 \u00b1 0.05%, Control. With this level of \n\nenrichment, the positional 2H enrichments obtained in blood glucose \n\nallowed for an adequate 2H NMR analysis in non-diabetic controls and STZ \n\nas shown in Figure 12. In those groups, 2H enrichment of blood glucose-\n\nderived MAG was 1.51 \u00b1 0.13% and 1.52 \u00b1 0.16%, respectively. However, \n\nbecause in IP and SC groups little glucose could be extracted from the blood \n\ndue to the hypoglycemia experienced by those animals, the 2H NMR spectra \n\nobtained in those cases didn\u2019t have a signal to noise ratio adequate for a \n\nconfident analysis.  \n\nThe 13C enrichment level at C1 of MAG from blood glucose was 4.35 \n\n\u00b1 0.10% in the non-diabetic controls, similar to that determined in the STZ: \n\n4.62 \u00b1 0.23%.

Hence, both a reduced \n\n\n\nEffect of insulin during a glucose challenge in diabetic rats|65 \n\nclearance of the oral load as well as an increased contribution from \n\nendogenous sources account for the hyperglycemic state of those animals. \n\nFor this reason, the relative contributions of load glucose (gastric + recycled) \n\nand endogenous precursors to blood glucose were similar between STZ and \n\nControl (Table 8). These findings are in line with the observations from \n\ninfusion studies by Wi et al where, one day after a 75 mg/kg STZ injection, \n\nhyperglycemia was associated with both increased glucose output and \n\nreduced clearance (Wi et al. 1998). Furthermore, those authors correlated the \n\ndefects in glucose clearance with a decreased uptake of plasma glucose by \n\nthe skeletal muscle. That mechanism also provides a good explanation for \n\nthe present observations of reduced recycled glucose contribution in the \n\nSTZ-diabetic rats since the apearence of recycled glucose relies largely on \n\nskeletal muscle uptake and metabolism of the parent [U-13C]glucose tracer. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 13  Contributions (expressed as glucose concentration) of gastric absorption, glucose \nload recycling and endogenous sources to blood glucose 3 hours after the glucose \ntolerance test.

Moreover, the contribution of EGP to plasma glucose \n\nis similar to the 75 \u00b1 7% determined for controls (see chapter 2). Finally, in \n\nboth cases, gluconeogenesis dominated EGP as estimated by the H5/H2 \n\nratio: 0.89 \u00b1 0.03 for STZ and 0.92 \u00b1 0.04 for Control. \n\n \n\n3.3.3.2 Effect of the insulin dose \n\nInsulin administration to the STZ-diabetic rats in the IP and SC \n\ngroups significantly altered glucose load disposal. In those groups the [U-\n13C]glucose isotopomer was no longer detectable in the blood 3 hours after \n\nthe oral gavage (see Figure 12), indicating that almost all of the glucose load \n\nhad been cleared from the circulation. Additionally, the contribution of \n\nglucose from recycling of the load was significantly reduced relative to both \n\nSTZ and Control groups. These observations, together with the absence of \n\nnet glycogen synthesis in the liver, suggest that glucose may have been \n\noxidized or stored as glycogen in the skeletal muscle. \n\nAt the end of the test, more than 90% of blood glucose had derived \n\nfrom endogenous sources in the STZ-diabetic rats injected with insulin \n\n(Table 8). This contribution represented a glucose concentration similar to \n\nthat observed in the non-diabetic controls, indicating that insulin reduced \n\nthe contribution of EGP relative to the STZ-diabetic rats. \n\nBecause of the poor signal to noise ratio that characterized most of \n\nthe 2H NMR MAG spectra from blood glucose in SC and IP groups, the \n\nrelative contributions of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis to EGP could \n\nnot be quantified with confidence. Nevertheless, the similar intensities for \n\nH5 and H2 signals of blood glucose-derived MAG obtained from these \n\nanimals (Figure 12) clearly indicate that gluconeogenesis was the main \n\nsource of EGP in both cases. \n\n\n\nEffect of insulin during a glucose challenge in diabetic rats|67 \n\n3.3.4 Hepatic glycogen synthesis \n\nHepatic glycogen synthesis in the setting of the OGTT was fully \n\ncharacterized in chapter 2 for the non-diabetic controls. In the case of STZ-\n\ndiabetic rats, there was no net glycogen synthesis in the liver. This was \n\ndemonstrated by the similar glycogen content found in the liver of those \n\nanimals before and after the OGTT, in contrast to what was observed for \n\nnon-diabetic controls that had 10 times more glycogen after the test (see \n\nsection 2.3.2). Insulin administration prior to the OGTT had no effect on the \n\nhepatic glycogen content. Furthermore, the percent 13C excess enrichment \n\ndetermined in the glycogen of rats from STZ, IP and SC groups was ~0.2%, \n\nmuch lower than the ~4% detected in the non-diabetic controls subjected to \n\nthe same protocol. \n\n \n\n3.4 Discussion \n\nWithout food intake blood glucose levels depend on EGP derived \n\neither from glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis. The gluconeogenic \n\ncontribution increases with the time of fasting. For example, in non-diabetic \n\nrats after 6 hours of fasting, gluconeogenesis accounts for about two thirds \n\nof EGP whereas after 24 hours of fasting that contribution represents over \n\n90% of EGP (Nunes et al. 2009). In the present studies (see also chapter 2) \n\nhepatic glycogen levels were highly depleted in control rats after the 24-\n\nhour fast, in good agreement with high gluconeogenic activity.  \n\nUnlike controls, the STZ-diabetic rats showed substantial levels of \n\nglycogen in the liver after the 24-hour fast. This has been previously \n\nreported by other authors (Friedmann et al. 1963; Ferrannini et al. 1990; \n\nPeroni et al. 1997). Apparently, these animals did not utilize hepatic \n\nglycogen stores during fasting, in accordance with the dominance of \n\ngluconeogenesis over glycogenolysis to EGP both in the post absorptive \n\nstate and after 24 hours of fasting (Peroni et al. 1997). Interestingly, \n\nFriedmann et al showed that in diabetic rats, hepatic glycogen could be \n\n\n\n68|Chapter 3 \n \n\ndepleted by prolonging the fasting period to 48 hours or by glucagon \n\ntreatment and that refeeding after these interventions resulted in efficient \n\nhepatic glycogen synthesis, although the maximal glycogen levels still \n\nremain under those of non-diabetic controls (Friedmann et al. 1963).  \n\nAs expected, gluconeogenesis also dominated EGP in the diabetic \n\nanimals, contributing to more than 60% of blood glucose at the end of the \n\ntest. This percent contribution was similar to that observed for controls but \n\nthe respective absolute contribution was much higher. In fact, all the \n\nabsolute contributions to blood glucose were increased in the diabetic rats. \n\nThe tracer-enriched OGTT protocol demonstrated that after the \n\nadministration of the oral glucose load to STZ-diabetic rats, the contribution \n\nof load glucose adds to that from glucose production to account for the \n\nelevated blood glucose levels observed at the end of the test. These findings \n\nare in line with elevated EGP (Blondel et al. 1989; Peroni et al. 1997; Wan et \n\nal. 2000) and reduced glucose clearance (Wi et al. 1998) in the post \n\nabsorptive state in STZ-diabetic rats.  \n\nA single insulin injection prior to the glucose challenge altered the \n\nglycemia response of the STZ-diabetic rats, resulting in a rapid and \n\npronounced decrease of plasma glucose levels. This enhanced glucose \n\nuptake from circulation resulted from two combined mechanisms. On the \n\none hand, insulin reduced the absolute contribution of endogenous sources \n\nto the plasma glucose pool from the abnormally elevated values in the STZ-\n\ndiabetic rats to control levels. In addition, insulin strongly promoted \n\nglucose clearance. This last action is most probably a consequence of \n\nperipheral uptake rather than hepatic disposal and storage as no efficient \n\nglycogen synthesis was detected. The persistent hypoglycemia observed in \n\nthe final minutes of the test is in agreement with the absence of glucagon \n\ncounterregulation to insulin-induced hypoglycemia in the STZ-diabetic rats \n\ninjected with insulin, by opposition to the glucagon response that follows \n\nnormal insulin secretion in non-diabetic rats (Zhou et al. 2004).   \n\n\n\nEffect of insulin during a glucose challenge in diabetic rats|69 \n\n3.5 Conclusions \n\nIn STZ-diabetic rats both a deficient glucose clearance in peripheral \n\ntissues and an excessive glucose production contribute to the hyperglycemic \n\nstate throughout the OGTT experiment. Hepatic glycogen serves as short-\n\nterm reservoir for endogenous gluconeognenic flux when fasted controls \n\nreceive an oral glucose load. In this way, EGP may be rapidly suppressed. \n\nData from these studies show that this mechanism is inoperative in the STZ-\n\ndiabetic rats. Insulin administration to STZ-diabetic rats reduced the \n\ncontribution of EGP to plasma glucose and, most importantly, enhanced \n\nperipheral glucose disposal; but had no effect on diverting the \n\ngluconeogenic flux from EGP to hepatic glycogen synthesis during the \n\nOGTT. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n|71 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4                                                                                                     \nGLUCOSE PRODUCTION AND HEPATIC GLYCOGEN AND LIPID \nSYNTHESIS DURING AD LIBITUM FEEDING CONDITIONS IN \n\nRATS \u2013 EFFECT OF DIABETES \n\n4.1 Introduction \n\nIn humans, direct and indirect pathway contributions to hepatic \n\nglycogen are quantified by analysis of plasma glucose and UDP-glucose \n\nenrichment following infusion of a glucose tracer as part of an intravenous \n\nglucose load (Hellerstein et al. 1995) with corrections for recycling of the \n\nlabeled carbon (Magnusson et al. 1987). Alternatively, the tracer can also be \n\ngiven as part of a meal (Taylor et al. 1996; Bischof et al. 2002) to study the \n\npathways of glycogen repletion under normal feeding conditions. This \n\napproach is poorly suited to study hepatic glycogen synthesis in ad libitum \n\nfed rats since they tend to feed intermittently over the entire dark period of \n\nthe diurnal cycle (Benavides et al. 1998). While there have been studies of \n\nglycogen synthesis under artificial substrate delivery conditions such as \n\nglucose infusion (Katz et al. 1989) or after a glucose load (Newgard et al. \n\n\n\n72|Chapter 4 \n \n\n1983; Shulman et al. 1985) there is no reported measurement of direct and \n\nindirect pathway activities in rats during their natural feeding routine. Since \n\npostprandial hepatic glycogen levels are sensitive to dietary composition \n\n(Ga\u00edva et al. 2003; MacQueen et al. 2007), measurement of direct and indirect \n\npathway activities under baseline conditions is essential for evaluating the \n\neffect of disease or other interventions on these fluxes. \n\nTo quantify hepatic glycogen repletion via direct and indirect \n\npathways during ad libitum feeding, the positional 2H-enrichment of hepatic \n\nglycogen was analyzed following the administration of 2H2O at the \n\nbeginning and throughout the feeding cycle. The contribution of indirect \n\npathways of hepatic glycogen synthesis was estimated by the ratio of \n\nglycogen 2H enrichment in position 5 relative to position 2 (H5/H2), see \n\nchapter 1. Moreover, the relative contributions of gluconeogenesis and \n\nglycogenolysis to EGP could also be disclosed by determining the H5/H2 \n\nratio in blood glucose. \n\nWith the present 2H2O administration protocol it was also possible to \n\ndetermine the contribution of DNL to the hepatic TG pool. That fraction was \n\ndetermined by analysis the 2H enrichment in the methyl group of the \n\nhepatic TG relative to that of the body water as reported by Delgado et al. \n\n(Delgado et al. 2009a).  \n\nThe key advantages of this assay are the simplicity of tracer \n\nadministration (no infusion catheters required) and that it can be applied to \n\nany substrate delivery setting including clamp studies, oral or i.p. glucose \n\nload and ad libitum feeding. In this study, this method was applied to define \n\nthe effect of STZ-induced diabetes on hepatic pathways for glucose disposal \n\nand storage as glycogen or TG and also pathways for EGP in ad libitum fed \n\nrats.  \n\n \n\n\n\nHepatic metabolism in ad libitum fed control and diabetic rats |73 \n\n4.2 Materials and methods \n\n4.2.1 Animal studies  \n\n4.2.1.1 Animal housing \n\nAs described in section 2.2.1.1. \n\n \n\n4.2.1.2 Animal protocols \n\nRats (245 \u00b1 4 g) were rendered diabetic by STZ injection as described \n\nin section 3.2.1.2. One group of animals consisted of non-diabetic control \n\nrats that were not injected with STZ (Control, N = 6). The other 3 groups \n\nconsisted of STZ-diabetic rats studied at day 4 (STZ-4, N = 6), 10 (STZ-10, N \n\n= 8) or 20 (STZ-20, N = 8) after the induction of the disease. At 7 pm all \n\nanimals received a loading dose of 99% 2H2O in saline by injection into the \n\ni.p. cavity. Assuming 70% body weight as water, the dose was calculated to \n\nenrich the body water to 2% or 3%. To maintain body water enrichment, \n\ntheir drinking water was enriched to 5% with 2H2O. At 8 am the next \n\nmorning, animals were anesthetized by injection of ketamine (2 mL/kg) in \n\nthe i.p. cavity, the abdominal cavity was opened and ~5 mL of blood were \n\ncollected from the abdominal aorta. A small blood sample (0.5 mL) was \n\nreserved for determination of 2H2O body water enrichment and plasma \n\ninsulin levels. The liver was excised and immediately freeze-clamped in \n\nliquid nitrogen.  \n\nA group of control rats (N = 5) was sacrificed at 7 pm without \n\nreceiving the 2H2O tracer and the livers harvested for determining the \n\nbaseline glycogen and TG content.  \n\n \n\n4.2.2 Metabolite analyses \n\nGlucose was extracted from the blood, hepatic glycogen isolated, \n\nhydrolyzed to glucose and quantified and plasma insulin levels quantified \n\n\n\n74|Chapter 4 \n \n\nas described section 2.2.2. Glucose was converted to MAG as described in \n\n2.2.3. Part of the lyophilized liver powder underwent lipid extraction \n\naccordingly with the method developed by Folch et al. (Folch et al. 1957). \n\nBriefly, approximately 1 g of powder was treated with 40 mL of \n\nchloroform:methanol (2:1, v:v). After centrifugation the liquid phase was \n\nrecovered and 8 mL of NaCl (0.9%) were added, the solutions were \n\nvigorously mixed, centrifuged and the lower phase collected. Chloroform \n\nwas evaporated under nitrogen flux and the lipid content stored at -20\u00baC \n\nuntil further analysis.  \n\n \n\n4.2.3 NMR spectroscopy \n\nAs described in sections 2.2.4, 2.2.4.1 and 2.2.4.2 \n\n \n\n4.2.3.1 1H and 2H analysis of lipids \n\nLipid samples were treated as described by Delgado et al (Delgado et \n\nal. 2009a). Briefly, lipids were dissolved in 0.6 mL of chloroform and 150 \u00b5L \n\nof a pyrazine-d4 solution were added as internal reference standard for \n\nquantification of hepatic TGs and determination of 2H methyl enrichment \n\nlevels. 1H and 2H NMR spectra were acquired at 25 \u00baC using the Varian 600 \n\nsystem equipped with a 5 mm broadband probe. 1H NMR spectra of lipid \n\nsamples consisted of one scan obtained using an acquisition time of 3 \n\nseconds and served for quantification of the hepatic TG content. 2H NMR \n\nspectra were obtained within 3 to 12 hours (depending on the amount of \n\nsample and 2H enrichment level) using a 90\u00ba pulse, an acquisition time of 5 \n\nseconds and a pulse delay of 2 seconds. The amount of 1H-TG was \n\ndetermined by comparing the area of the methyl hydrogens with that of the \n\npyrazine hydrogens in the 1H NMR spectrum of each sample and the \n\namount of 2H-TG was determined by comparing the areas for those signals \n\nin the respective 2H NMR spectrum. Hence, the hepatic TG content was \n\n\n\nHepatic metabolism in ad libitum fed control and diabetic rats |75 \n\ncalculated as the sum of 1H- and 2H-TG. The absolute 2H methyl enrichment \n\nwas calculated as follows: \n \n\n2H methyl enrichment ?\n2H?TG\n\n2H?TG ? 1H?TG \n \n\nThis quantification method was tested for linearity using a series of \n\npalmitic acid standards solutions prepared in chloroform from known \n\namounts of [U-2H]palmitic acid so that enrichment levels ranged from \n\n0.035% to 0.40% (Figure 14).  \n\n \n\n \n \nFigure 14 Plot of the theoretical 2H enrichment level of a series of palmitic acid standards \n\nprepared from palmitic acid and [U-2H]palmitic acid versus the 2H enrichment \ncalculated as described.

Likewise, the \n\ncontribution of newly synthesized TGs (DNL) to the hepatic TG pool was \n\ncalculated as the ratio of 2H methyl enrichment to body water 2H \n\nenrichment. \n\n \n\n4.2.5 Statistics \n\nAs described in section 2.2.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Results \n\n4.3.1 Induction of diabetes \n\nIn this study, STZ-diabetic rats were assayed in three early stages of \n\nthe disease. The first stage corresponded to 4 days after STZ injection and \n\nthe other two corresponded to 10 and 20 days. In all of those stages animals \n\nwere profoundly hyperglycemic (Table 9). This observation is in agreement \n\nwith the reduced levels of plasma insulin determined for STZ-10 and STZ-\n\n20. Moreover, the hepatic glycogen content was reduced and the TG levels \n\nincreased with the induction of diabetes by this method, in accordance with \n\nreports from other authors for SZT-diabetic rodent models (Pighin et al. \n\n2005; Fernandes et al. 2010). These alterations were observed 10 and 20 days \n\nafter the injection of STZ, but not at 4 days. Hence, 4 days after STZ \n\ninjection, although rats develop hyperglycemia they still have hepatic \n\nglycogen and TG levels comparable with controls.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nHepatic metabolism in ad libitum fed control and diabetic rats |77 \n\nTable 9: Glycemia, plasma insulin, hepatic glycogen and triglyceride content determined \nafter an overnight feeding under 2H2O administration in non-diabetic controls (Control) and \nSTZ-diabetic rats assayed 4 (STZ-4), 10 (STZ-10) and 20 days (STZ-20) after induction of \ndiabetes.

The \n\nremainder originates from absorption in the GIT. In non-diabetic controls, \n\nEGP accounted for 40 \u00b1 4% of blood glucose and was similar to that \n\ndetermined in all STZ groups. Since STZ animals were hyperglycemic, they \n\nprobably displayed higher rates of EGP coupled with increased food intake \n\ndue to diabetes-related hyperphagia.

This likely \n\nreflects a weaker control (i.e. suppression) of EGP in animals that had been \n\ndiabetic for a longer period. The STZ-10 and STZ-20 groups were additionally \n\ncharacterized by a significantly higher gluconeogenenic contribution to EGP \n\ncompared to the STZ-4 group, which presented values comparable with non-\n\ndiabetic controls (Figure 16). \n\n \n\n \n \nFigure 16 Relative contributions of gluconeogenesis (white bars) and glycogenolysis (grey \n\nbars) to endogenous glucose production determined after an overnight feeding \nunder 2H2O administration.

This finding is in line with the circadian rhythm of hepatic \n\nglycogen, which increases during the dark phase and is consumed during \n\nthe light phase under normal ad libitum feeding conditions (Lanza-Jacoby et \n\nal. 1986; Benavides et al. 1998). The net glycogen synthesis overnight \n\nrepresented about one third of the total hepatic glycogen content \n\ndetermined at the beginning of the light phase. This value is in excellent \n\nagreement with the estimation of glycogen synthesis from the 2H \n\nenrichment in glycogen position 2 relative to that in body water, which \n\nreported a 34 \u00b1 7% contribution in controls (Table 11). In the STZ-4 group \n\nthis contribution was similar to controls but it increased significantly in \n\nSTZ-10 and STZ-20, representing in those cases more than half of the \n\nglycogen. The higher fractional synthesis values detected for the STZ-10 and \n\nSTZ-20 groups are consistent with the smaller glycogen pool observed for \n\nthose animals. In fact, the amount of glycogen synthesized during the \n\nexperiment (total amount of glycogen \u00d7 2H2-Glycogen/2H-body water) was \n\nsimilar among the several groups.  \n \n\nTable 11: Contribution of newly synthesized glycogen to the hepatic pool and amount of \nglycogen synthesized overnight determined after an overnight feeding under 2H2O \nadministration.

Perhaps not surprisingly, gene array experiments performed over a 24-\n\nhour period clearly demonstrate that rat liver gene expression oscillates \n\naccordingly with the light cycle, including the expression of enzymes involved \n\nin carbohydrate and lipid metabolism (Almon et al. 2008). Hence, during \n\nfeeding, pathways for glucose disposal and storage must be favoured against \n\nglucose production.  \n\nThe studies described on this chapter were designed to follow several \n\nmetabolic insulin-dependent pathways during the natural feeding cycle of \n\nrats. The protocol consisted on keeping the animals under 2H2O \n\nadministration overnight so that pathways for glucose production, hepatic \n\nglycogen and TG synthesis could be simultaneously traced in one single \n\nexperimental setting by 2H NMR methods. With this methodological approach \n\nthere is no interference with the animals\u2019 natural feeding behaviour and hence \n\nthe data obtained reflect the metabolic performance in the absorptive state \n\nunder ad libitum conditions. The baseline measurements determined in non-\n\ndiabetic rats were sensitive to the STZ-induced type 1 DM, making this a \n\nvaluable protocol for addressing the effect of any intervention in the context of \n\ndiabetes.  \n\n \n\n4.4.2 Sources to blood glucose and hepatic glycogen synthesis \n\nDuring the absorptive phase, blood glucose may be derived from \n\nboth dietary absorption and endogenous production. In the present \n\nexperimental setting, assuming the G6P/F6P exchange is complete and \n\n\n\n86|Chapter 4 \n \n\nthere is no substancial glucose/G6P cycling, glucose from EGP is enriched \n\nwith 2H in position 2 to the same level as body water and that enrichment is \n\ndiluted by glucose derived from absorption. In the STZ-diabetic rats, the \n\nrelative contributions of EGP and dietary sources to blood glucose were \n\nsimilar to those determined for non-diabetic controls, despite much higher \n\nglycemia values for the STZ-diabetic animals. Insulin deficiency is expected \n\nto result in higher endogenous contributions to feeding plasma glucose \n\nlevels as a result of impaired EGP suppression. However, STZ-diabetic rats \n\nalso eat more than controls (see also chapter 915, Table 14), due to the \n\nhyperphagia associated with the lack of hypothalamic insulin and leptin \n\nsignalling (Sindelar et al. 1999; Akirav et al. 2004). This would translate into \n\nan increased uptake of dietary glucose. Therefore, the observation that EGP \n\nand dietary contributions to blood glucose levels in the hyperglycemic STZ \n\nrats were similar to those of normoglycemic controls may be explained by \n\nsystematic increases in both EGP and glucose absorption rates for the STZ-\n\ndiabetic rats.  \n\nIn the non-diabetic controls, the 2H2O method indicated that \n\nimmediately after an overnight feeding, gluconeogenesis accounts for the \n\nmajority (approximately two thirds) of EGP. This is similar to estimates \n\nobtained after 6 hours of fasting in the same rat specie and using the same \n\nmethodology as that described in these experiments (Nunes et al. 2009). \n\nSaadatian et al. report a somewhat lower (~50%) contribution of \n\ngluconeogenesis to EGP (Saadatian et al. 2000), using mass spectrometry \n\nmethods. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that \n\ngluconeogenesis is continually active in non-diabetic free-feeding rats and \n\ndoes not appreciably change during the fed to fasted transition.  \n\nIn control rats only ~30% of the hepatic glycogen was synthesized \n\novernight and of that fraction ~50% was enriched with 2H from 2H2O-enriched \n\nbody water in both positions 5 and 2. The 2H2O method relies on the \n\nassumption that only glucose derived from gluconeogenesis is enriched with \n2H from 2H2O in both positions 5 and 2. But, because under the present \n\nexperimental protocol 15% (30% \u00d7 50%) of the total hepatic glycogen was also \n\n\n\nHepatic metabolism in ad libitum fed control and diabetic rats |87 \n\nenriched with 2H in both positions 5 and 2, the contribution of glycogenolysis \n\nmay be underestimated, but to a minor degree. Applying the 15% correction \n\nfactor yields a 35% (instead of the 30%) contribution of glycogenolysis to EGP. \n\nHence, under these circumstances, the 2H2O method is fairly reliable. \n\nHowever, in the case of diabetic rats studied 10 and 20 days after STZ \n\ninjection, because of the high glycogen turnover (~60%) and the complete \n\ndominance of the indirect pathway (~95%), the majority of the glycogenolytic \n\ncontribution to blood glucose is indistinguishable from the gluconeogenic \n\ncontribution because the glucose derived from glycogen is labeled in both 5 \n\nand 2 positions. Furthermore, since the amount of glycogen synthesized \n\novernight was apparently the same in all groups, the reduced glycogen levels \n\nobserved in the later stages of STZ-diabetes must be a consequence of \n\nexcessive glycogen breakdown. Taken together, these observations indicate \n\nthat, at least 10 days after induction of diabetes by STZ injection to rats, there \n\nwas extensive glycogen degradation with simultaneous synthesis during the \n\nabsorptive state (i.e. glycogen cycling).  \n\n \n\n4.4.3 Estimation of de novo lipogenesis \n\nWith the induction of diabetes there was a drastic reduction on the \n\nDNL contribution to the hepatic TG pool and this was immediately detected 4 \n\ndays after STZ injection. These observations are in line with Cohen\u2019s (Cohen \n\n1987) experiments in perfused livers from control and STZ rats reporting that \n\nin the latter case the flux through pyruvate carboxylase is increased relative to \n\nthat through pyruvate dehydrogenase resulting, amongst other things, in the \n\nrecruitment of pyruvate into gluconeogenesis, rather than its oxidation to \n\nacetyl-CoA molecules for lipogenesis. \n\nThe synthesis of TG de novo in the liver was estimated by 2H NMR \n\nanalysis of the hepatic lipid content as the ratio of the 2H-methyl enrichment \n\nrelative to that of body water. Although this estimation provides valuable \n\ninsight on the hepatic lipid kinetics it is not an accurate quantification of the \n\ncontribution of DNL to the hepatic TG content. Ideally, the 2H enrichment in \n\n\n\n88|Chapter 4 \n \n\nthe methyl-TG should be compared to that of the precursor acetyl-CoA pool \n\nbut that intermediate is scarce and difficult to isolate. Therefore, a necessary \n\nsimplifying assumption is that the hepatic 2H acetyl-CoA enrichment is \n\nequivalent to that of body water. It is not know to what extent the acetyl-CoA \n\nmethyl hydrogens directly exchange with those of water in the cellular \n\nenvironment, but it is well know that many of the key acetyl-CoA precursors \u2013 \n\nnotably pyruvate \u2013 exchange extensively (Kuwajima et al. 1986) while others, \n\nsuch as fatty acids, involve the direct adition of water hydrogens to the methyl \n\ngroup when undergoing ?-oxidation to acetyl-CoA. \n\nUnder feeding conditions, pyruvate is considered to be the main \n\nsource of acetyl-CoA (Cohen 1987) and the incorporation of 2H from body \n\nwater in pyruvate is extensive (Kuwajima et al. 1986) but not necessarily \n\ncomplete (Silva et al. 2011). To the extent that the true acetyl-CoA 2H \n\nenrichment is less than that of body water, DNL contributions to the hepatic \n\nTG pool are systematically underestimated.  \n\nAnother factor affecting the estimations of DNL is the turnover of the \n\nhepatic TG pool. After 12 hours under 2H2O administration it is possible that \n\nthe TGs did not turn over completely and hence pre-existing TGs may be \n\naccounting for the dilution of the 2H labelling in addition to the contribution of \n\ndietary and/or adipose tissue-derived TGs. Nonetheless, the DNL \n\ncontribution determined in this experiment for non-diabetic controls was in \n\nthe range of that found by Delgado et al. after 72 hours of 2H2O administration \n\n(Delgado et al. 2009a), suggesting the TG pool turned over during the \n\novernight 2H2O protocol. In the case of the STZ diabetic rats, TG turnover may \n\ntake longer given the higher hepatic pool.  \n\n \n\n4.4.4 Progressive metabolic disruption in STZ-diabetes and \n\nrelationship between carbohydrate and lipid metabolism \n\nExperimental diabetes was induced by injection of STZ in the i.p. \n\ncavity and rats studied 4, 10 and 20 days afterwards. In all cases, rats were \n\nprofoundly hyperglycemic. This finding is consistent with the rapid \n\n\n\nHepatic metabolism in ad libitum fed control and diabetic rats |89 \n\ndevelopment of diabetic symptoms in the STZ-diabetic rat model (Burcelin \n\net al. 1995; Sindelar et al. 1999; Wei et al. 2003). Furthermore, data from this \n\nstudy indicate that some metabolic pathways are altered in the first days \n\nfollowing STZ injection and that those alterations are sustained afterwards. \n\nFor example, at day 4 , the relative pathways to EGP were similar to controls \n\nand the contributions of the direct pathway to glycogen and DNL to hepatic \n\nTG \u2013 although reduced compred to controls \u2013 were not as low as those \n\nobserved for the other STZ groups. In the later stages of diabetes (10 and 20 \n\ndays after STZ injection), the complete dominance of gluconeogenesis to \n\nboth glycogen synthesis and glucose production correlates with the \n\nprofound reduction of the lipogenic flux. Moreover, the elevated levels of \n\nTGs in the livers from 10- and 20-day STZ-diabetic rats suggest adipose \n\ntissue lipolysis is likely to be the dominant source for hepatic TGs. Among \n\nother things, the increased abundance of hepatic lipids helps to sustain high \n\nrates of gluconeogenesis and EGP.  \n\n \n\n4.5 Conclusions \n\nThe 2H2O protocol for the study of the absorptive phase under natural \n\nfeeding conditions was successfully applied to both non-diabetic controls and \n\nSTZ-diabetic rats. With one single experiment, it identified early alterations in \n\nhepatic carbohydrate and lipid metabolism following ? cell destruction by \n\nSTZ. Namely, DNL was profoundly reduced as early as 4 days after the \n\ninduction of diabetes. By that time the indirect pathway to glycogen synthesis \n\nwas already increased relative to controls but the contributions of \n\nglycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis to blood glucose were normal. In the later \n\nstages of STZ-diabetes, gluconeogenesis was the major source of both EGP and \n\nglycogen synthesis. The dominance of the gluconeogenic (indirect) pathway to \n\nglycogen synthesis and the rapid turnover of the hepatic pool via glycogen \n\ncycling translated into an extensive enrichment of hepatic glycogen positions 5 \n\nand 2 from 2H2O. This likely resulted in an underestimation of the \n\n\n\n90|Chapter 4 \n \n\nglycogenolytic contribution to EGP as determined by the overnight 2H2O \n\nmethod. \n\n\n\n|91 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5                                                                                                     \nGLUCOSE PRODUCTION AND HEPATIC GLYCOGEN AND LIPID \nSYNTHESIS DURING AD LIBITUM FEEDING CONDITIONS IN \n\nRATS \u2013 EFFECT OF INSULIN REPLACEMENT  \n\n5.1 Introduction \n\nType 1 diabetic patients have insufficient pancreatic insulin secretion \n\nand thus must rely on exogenous insulin supply to avoid persistent \n\nhyperglycemia and related complications. With the conventional s.c. insulin \n\ntreatment the peripheral tissues are the ones that receive most of the insulin \n\ndose. On the other hand, i.p. insulin administration is able to mimic the \n\nphysiological insulin release, maintaining a portal/peripheral gradient \n\nconcentration with insulin absorption occurring evenly through splanchnic \n\nand peripheral routes (Radziuk et al. 1994). In fact, under physiological \n\nconditions, insulin is secreted by the pancreas to the portal vein and the \n\nliver accounts for the extraction of a 50-80% fraction (Radziuk et al. 1994; \n\nUtzschneider et al. 2004).  \n\n\n\n92|Chapter 5 \n \n\nThere are some studies highlighting the relevance of i.p. insulin \n\ndelivery in the context of diabetes treatment. Implanted insulin pumps that \n\ndeliver insulin by i.p. infusion reduce the risk of hyperglycemia, and offer a \n\nbetter metabolic control compared with s.c. infusion pumps (Catargi 2004). \n\nIntraperitoneal insulin has also been administered to diabetic patients with \n\nend-stage renal disease undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal \n\ndialysis and this allowed for improving the glycemic control over \n\nconventional s.c. delivery (Nevalainen et al. 1997).  \n\nExperiments in STZ-diabetic rats have demonstrated the beneficial \n\neffect of i.p. insulin on reducing glucose production, peripheral \n\nhyperinsulinemia, and improving glucose disposal relative to s.c. insulin \n\n(Mason et al. 2000; Wan et al. 2000). However, those studies were performed \n\nin post-absorptive conditions (after 5-6 hours of fast) and it would be of \n\ninterest to evaluate the effect of i.p. insulin in natural feeding rats. \n\nDuring feeding, insulin stimulates the usage of glucose and its \n\nstorage as glycogen and lipids in the liver. This is accomplished by diverse \n\nmechanisms through changes in enzyme activities and/or expression \n\n(overviewed in section 1.3.1). Since the liver is the organ targeted with i.p. \n\ninsulin delivery, it can be hypothesized that the hepatic metabolic pathways \n\nwill respond differently to the s.c. or i.p. insulin therapies. This chapter \n\ndescribes and discusses the experiments set to test that hypothesis. The \n\nmethodological approach was the same described in chapter 4 to address \n\nhepatic insulin-dependent metabolic pathways during the absorptive state \n\nin rats. In addition, gene expression and enzyme activities for some key \n\nmetabolic enzymes involved in those pathways were also assessed. The \n\nalterations detected in STZ-diabetes were recapitulated and in parallel the \n\neffect of insulin replacement during a short period was addressed. Insulin \n\ntherapy began two weeks after the induction of diabetes, when the \n\npathways for glucose production, hepatic glycogen and lipid synthesis were \n\nalready severely disrupted (see chapter 4). \n\n\n\nMetabolic effects of insulin replacement in ad libitum fed diabetic rats |93 \n\n5.2 Materials and methods \n\n5.2.1 Animal studies \n\n5.2.1.1 Animal housing \n\nAs described in section 2.2.1.1. \n\n \n\n5.2.1.2 Animal protocols \n\nRats (280 \u00b1 2 g) were rendered diabetic by STZ injection as described \n\nin section 3.2.1.2. Eight days after diabetes induction animals were assigned \n\nat random into 3 groups: one group of animals was administered a s.c. \n\ninsulin injection at a dose of 15 U/kg twice a day at 8 am and 7 pm (group I-\n\nSC, N = 9); a second group of animals received an i.p. insulin injection at the \n\nsame dose and times as the I-SC group (group I-IP, N = 9); finally, a third \n\ngroup of animals received no treatment at all (group D, N = 7). Animals \n\nwere kept under the insulin treatment protocol for 9 or 10 days. Blood \n\nglucose and TG levels were monitored throughout the experimental period \n\nwith an Accu-check and Accutrend (Roche, Portugal) meters, respectively. \n\nAt the end of the treatment period, 30 minutes after the night insulin \n\ninjection, animals received a loading dose of 99% 2H2O in saline by injection \n\ninto the i.p. cavity and the experiment proceeded as described in section \n\n4.2.1.2. Animals were sacrificed the next morning. Blood was collected for \n\nglucose extraction and NMR analysis and a small blood sample was \n\nreserved for determination of 2H2O enrichment levels, insulin and NEFA in \n\nthe plasma. The liver was excised, immediately freeze-clamped in liquid \n\nnitrogen.

This was further confirmed by the reduced \n\nendogenous insulin levels determined at the end of the experiment for group \n\nD relative to the healthy controls (Table 14).  \n\nThroughout the experimental follow-up, the animals in group D \n\ncontinued to lose weight, while the ones kept under insulin treatment tended \n\nto gain weight (Figure 21). At the end of the insulin replacement protocol, the \n\nbody weight of untreated diabetic animals was 234 \u00b1 10 g, significantly lower \n\nthan the 288 \u00b1 7 g and the 270 \u00b1 5 g observed for I-SC and I-IP, respectively (p \n\n= 0.06, I-SC vs I-IP). Furthermore, the weight variation was quantified by the \n\nAUC in the weight vs time plot (Table 14), and was significantly increased for \n\ngroups I-SC and I-IP relative to group D. Taken together, these observations \n\ndemonstrate the positive effect of insulin on weight gain. Consistent with this \n\nfinding, EWAT also increased with insulin treatment. \n\nAs presented in Table 14, food and water consumption determined at \n\nthe end of the experiment, were sensitive to the diabetic condition and also \n\ninsulin treatment. In non-diabetic controls food consumption was 23 g/day, \n\nand water intake 35 mL/day, in good agreement with reports from several \n\nother authors (Havel et al. 1998; Dib 1999; Wei et al. 2003). As expected, \n\ndiabetic animals ate and drank significantly more than controls. Insulin \n\nreplacement decreased food (p &lt;0.05, D vs I-IP and p = 0.06 D vs I-SC) and \n\nwater intakes in the treated diabetic rats, but the observed values were still \n\nhigher than control levels.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMetabolic effects of insulin replacement in ad libitum fed diabetic rats |99 \n\nTable 14: Biochemical and physiological parameters determined during the insulin replacement study \nin untreated STZ-diabetic rats (D), STZ-diabetic rats treated with insulin by subcutaneous (I-\nSC) or intraperitoneal (I-IP) injection twice a day at a dose of 30 U/kg/day and non-diabetic \ncontrols (C).

The effect of \n\ninsulin replacement on lowering the plasma TG levels may be a consequence \n\nof the enhanced chylomicron-TGs clearance by stimulation of LPL in the \n\nadipose tissue. This is consistent with the accumulation of fat as demonstrated \n\nby the higher content of EWAT in the insulin-treated diabetic animals relative \n\nto the untreated ones. In addition, insulin may also contribute to lower plasma \n\nTGs by inhibiting their hepatic secretion in VLDL. \n\n \n\n \n \nFigure 21 Plot of the animals\u2019 body weight as a function of time during the insulin \n\nreplacement period.

Instead, and \n\nsurprisingly, plasma NEFA concentration increased in the insulin-treated \n\ngroups. This observation can be related to the larger mass of adipose tissue \n\nthose animals presented. Actually, if plasma NEFA concentration is \n\nnormalized for the mass of EWAT, the values for insulin treated rats tend to be \n\nlower than those for the STZ-diabetic rats. \n\n0 5 10\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nD\n\nI-SC\n\nI-IP\n\nday of insulin replacement\n\nb\no\n\nd\ny \n\nw\ne\n\nig\nh\n\nt \n(g\n\n)\n\n\n\nMetabolic effects of insulin replacement in ad libitum fed diabetic rats |101 \n\nSimilarly to the findings from the experiments described in chapter 4, \n\nhepatic glycogen content was reduced and TG levels increased in the \n\nuntreated diabetic rats relative to controls. Insulin replacement in the I-IP \n\ngroup increased glycogen levels back to control values. On the other hand, in \n\nthe I-SC group, although hepatic glycogen content was significantly higher \n\nthan that observed for untreated diabetic rats, it was still lower than control \n\nlevels. In contrast with observations from other authors (Shimomura et al. \n\n1999), hepatic TG content remained elevated in the diabetic rats receiving the \n\ninsulin replacement treatments. \n\n \n\n5.3.2 2H enrichment levels and metabolic parameters  \n\nAfter the insulin replacement period (9 or 10 days) all the animals \n\nwere administered 2H2O and left to feed ad libitum overnight to trace the \n\nabsorptive metabolism. The accurate body water 2H2O precursor \n\nenrichment was determined by 2H NMR analysis of plasma samples and \n\nreached the target value of 2% (Table 15). With these range of values, \n\nplasma glucose, hepatic glycogen and lipids were also enriched with 2H to \n\nlevels that, coupled with the amount of sample recovered, allowed precise \n\nanalysis by 2H NMR. All the STZ-diabetic rats had comparable 2H2O \n\nprecursor enrichment levels. However, the insulin-treated rats, 2H \n\nenrichment in position 2 of blood glucose was higher than that of untreated \n\nSTZ-diabetic rats, indicating insulin enhanced glucose turnover. On the \n\nother hand the 2H2 enrichment in glycogen was lower in the rats \n\nexperiencing the insulin replacement protocol, consistent with the bigger \n\nhepatic glycogen pool. Insulin increased the absolute 2H enrichment in the \n\nmethyl-TG, indicating a stimulation of the lipogenic pathway and reduction \n\nof the dietary and/or lipolytic contribution since the hepatic TG content was \n\nsimilar among all STZ-diabetic rats. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n102|Chapter 5 \n \n\nTable 15: Body water and metabolite absolute 2H enrichment levels observed after an \novernight feeding under 2H2O administration.

Hence, the contribution of EGP to blood \n\nglucose was assessed by the 2H enrichment of position 2 of blood glucose \n\nrelative to that of body water (2H2/2H-BW). In non-diabetic control animals \n\nEGP accounted for 40 \u00b1 4% of blood glucose. This contribution was similar \n\nto that observed for group D (44 \u00b1 4%) because in these animals the \n\nincreased food intake is parallel to higher rates of EGP (see discussion in \n\nchapter 4, section 4.4.2). In the cases where the animals were subjected to the \n\ninsulin treatment protocols, the contribution of EGP to blood glucose was \n\nsignificantly higher reaching 73 \u00b1 3% in group I-SC and 71 \u00b1 5% in group I-\n\nIP. The fact that insulin administration by both s.c. and i.p. routes translated \n\ninto a higher contribution of EGP to blood glucose relative to that coming \n\nfrom the diet is consistent with the reduction on food intake and thus on the \n\ncontribution of unlabeled dietary glucose. However, apparently, insulin did \n\nnot efficiently reduce the rates of EGP under feeding conditions. \n\nFigure 22 represents the glycogenolytic and gluconeogenic \n\ncontributions to EGP as determined by 2H NMR analysis of MAG derivative \n\n\n\nMetabolic effects of insulin replacement in ad libitum fed diabetic rats |103 \n\nfrom blood glucose.

PFK gene expression was similar \n\namong all study groups and its activity was similar for groups D, I-SC and \n\nI-IP. Moreover, in all the latter cases PFK activity was significantly lower \n\nthan that measured for group C.

Accordingly, the PK \n\nactivity was significantly reduced in group D, relative to controls. Both \n\ninsulin treatments resulted in significantly higher PK activities when \n\ncomparing to diabetics, with the PK activity in the I-SC group being \n\nsignificantly higher than the one measured for I-IP, but these were however \n\nstill significantly less than activities of controls. \n\nThe hepatic gene expression of G6PDH was similar among all study \n\ngroups. On the other hand, the activities of both G6PDH and 6PGDH were \n\naltered with diabetes and insulin replacement.

The induction of SREBP1c by insulin is in good \n\nagreement with the increased expression of the glycolytic and lipogenic \n\nenzymes in the insulin-treated diabetic rats. \n\n \n\n5.4 Discussion \n\nChapter 4 established a 2H2O-based protocol for the study of the \n\nabsorptive state. Those experiments pointed out the metabolic disruptions that \n\ntake place with the induction of diabetes by STZ injection in regards to glucose \n\nproduction, hepatic glycogen and lipid synthesis. The study described in this \n\nchapter recapitulated those alterations and assessed the effect of insulin \n\nreplacement on those pathways in two groups of rats receiving treatment for 9 \n\nor 10 days to the i.p. or s.c. route. In addition, modifications on the gene \n\nexpression and activities of several key enzymes were evaluated. Hence, these \n\nexperiments allowed for a comprehensive study of hepatic metabolism by \n\nmeasuring the overall metabolic performance with the tracer-based approach \n\nand disclosing some regulatory aspects of hepatic glucose and lipid \n\nmetabolism by gene expression and enzymology techniques. With these \n\n\n\n110|Chapter 5 \n \n\nmethods it was possible to identify the benefits and limitations of the insulin \n\nreplacement protocol adopted. \n\n \n\n5.4.1 Alterations underlying the dominance of gluconeogenesis \n\nin STZ-diabetic rats \n\nIn STZ-diabetic rats, both EGP and glycogen synthesis were dominated \n\nby the gluconeogenic flux. This was determined by the analysis of plasma \n\nglucose and hepatic glycogen 2H enrichment profile from 2H2O and confirmed \n\nby the increased expression of hepatic PEPCK and FBPase. The expression of \n\nG6Pase, although higher in the case of STZ-diabetic rats, was not statistically \n\ndifferent from control levels. However, other authors (Hidaka et al. 2002) \n\nreport that, in addition to PEPCK, G6Pase mRNA levels are increased in fed \n\nSTZ-diabetic rats in a similar stage of the disease, relative to non-diabetic \n\ncontrols. The finding that in the present experimental setting, PEPCK gene \n\nexpression was highly sensitive to insulinopenic STZ-diabetes (mRNA levels \n\nin diabetics were 7\u00d7 higher than in controls) is consistent with the idea that \n\ninsulin has a dominant action on the transcriptional regulation of PEPCK gene \n\n(Scott et al. 2003; Yabaluri et al. 2010).  \n\nGluconeogenesis from pyruvate is an energy-expensive pathway that \n\nis dependent on ATP and NADH. These can be derived from the ?-oxidation \n\nof fatty acids in mitochondria. High rates of hepatic ?-oxidation are supported \n\nby the increased expression of the CPT1a transporter and also by the increased \n\navailability of NEFA as a result of insulin deficiency in the STZ-diabetic rats.  \n\n \n\n5.4.2 Alterations in hepatic lipid metabolism in STZ-diabetic \n\nrats \n\nInsulin deficiency impaired lipid uptake into adipose tissue in the \n\nSTZ-diabetic rats as demonstrated by the reduced EWAT content and the \n\nelevated plasma TG levels. As a result, TGs not cleared by the adipocytes \n\n\n\nMetabolic effects of insulin replacement in ad libitum fed diabetic rats |111 \n\naccumulated in the liver. The prevalence of hepatic TGs as a consequence of \n\nabnormal lipid metabolism by the adipose tissue rather than of hepatic de \n\nnovo production was further demonstrated by the down regulation of the \n\nlipogenic enzymes (CL and FAS) and, consistently, the residual contribution \n\nof DNL to the hepatic TG pool as estimated by the 2H2O method. In this \n\nsetting, it was anticipated that the NEFA flux from adipose tissue lipolysis \n\nwould be increased, in agreement with the reduced levels of circulating \n\ninsulin. The similar plasma NEFA concentration between diabetics and \n\ncontrols may be explained by the highly depleted TG stores in the adipose \n\ntissue. In accord with this, the EWAT content of diabetic rats represented \n\nonly ~0.3% of the animals\u2019 body weight, compared to the 0.6-1.2% range \n\nreported for non-diabetic controls (DiGirolamo et al. 1998; Wren et al. 2001; \n\nTakada et al. 2008).  \n\n \n\n5.4.3 Metabolic control and limitations of the insulin \n\nreplacement therapy \n\nSeveral biochemical and physiological parameters were improved by \n\nthe insulin replacement protocols. For example, there was an increase in the \n\nanimals\u2019 body weight, in similar fashion to what was observed by other \n\nauthors for STZ diabetic rats under a similar twice-daily insulin \n\nadministration protocol (Suthagar et al. 2009) or under continuous insulin \n\ndelivery by the use of infusion pumps (Wan et al. 2000). Likewise the \n\ndeposition of fat in adipose tissue was increased as demonstrated by the \n\nhigher content of EWAT. Moreover, the insulin-treated diabetic rats showed \n\nan alleviation of the symptoms associated with the disease, such as the \n\nhyperphagia and polydepsia. \n\nHowever, the metabolic evaluation by both the 2H2O tracer approach \n\nand gene expression and enzyme activities analyses suggests that the insulin \n\ntreatment was in many aspects unable to revert the performance of diabetic \n\nanimals back to that of controls. Insulin was administered as a rapid-acting \n\nformulation in two equal doses, one at the beginning of the dark phase (7 pm) \n\n\n\n112|Chapter 5 \n \n\nand the other at the beginning of the light phase (8 am). Prior to the \n\nadministration of the morning insulin dose, glycemia was similar to that of \n\nuntreated diabetic rats, in the hyperglycemic range. This indicates that the \n\ntwice-daily insulin injection posology failed to afford normoglycemia \n\nthroughout the complete day course. Under these circumstances, insulin \n\naction is no longer observed at the beginning of the light phase, in agreement \n\nwith increased gluconeogenesis, fatty oxidation in the liver, and adipose tissue \n\nlipolysis as discussed below. \n\nInsulin replacement was able to normalize the relative contributions of \n\ngluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis to EGP. This finding is in line with \n\nreports from studies on controlled type 1 diabetic patients (Bischof et al. 2002). \n\nHowever, in the present experiment, the absolute fluxes of glycogenolysis and \n\ngluconeogenesis must remain elevated even after the treatment of the diabetic \n\nrats, accounting for the hyperglycemia observed in the morning. The gene \n\nexpression analysis showed that, after an overnight feeding, the gluconeogenic \n\nenzymes were upregulated, supporting the increased absolute flux of \n\ngluconeogenesis in the insulin-treated diabetic rats.  \n\nDespite the abnormalities in EGP the glycogenic and lipogenic \n\npathways responded efficiently to insulin replacement in the diabetic rats, \n\neven in face of the incomplete insulinization throughout the day course. The \n\nrestoration of GK gene expression and activity to control levels correlates very \n\nwell with the increase in glycogen content in the liver. This effect is in \n\naccordance with the enhancement of glycogen synthesis in hepatocytes \n\n(O'Doherty et al. 1996; Seoane et al. 1999) and diabetic rats (Morral et al. 2004) \n\noverexpressing GK. In addition, in the diabetic rats, there was a complete \n\nrecovery of the direct pathway flux with both insulin replacement protocols, \n\ncontrarily to the observations for human type 1 diabetic patients that \n\nunderwent intensive long-term insulin therapy where the fraction of glycogen \n\nsynthesized by the indirect pathway remained dominant (Bischof et al. 2002). \n\nThe stimulation of GK gene expression and activities parallel to those \n\nof PK and to the gene expression of several lipogenic enzymes, supports the \n\ncoupling of glycolytic and DNL fluxes. With insulin treatment, the mRNA \n\n\n\nMetabolic effects of insulin replacement in ad libitum fed diabetic rats |113 \n\nlevels of CL, ACC and FAS were increased to control levels or even higher (in \n\nthe case of ACC). The increased gene expression of lipogenic enzymes in \n\ninsulin-treated diabetic rats is in good agreement with the enhancement of \n\nDNL determined by 2H NMR methods and also with the stimulation of the \n\ndehydrogenases activities in the pentose phosphate pathway that generate \n\nNAPDH molecules for DNL.  \n\nNonetheless, DNL was not completely restored to control levels. In \n\npart, this was due to an important contribution from adipose tissue lipolysis to \n\nthe hepatic TG pool, consistent with the elevated levels of circulating NEFA in \n\nthe STZ-rats undergoing insulin replacement therapy. With both increased \n\ncontribution from de novo production and adipose tissue lipolysis it was \n\nsurprising that the hepatic TG content did not increase relative to the \n\nuntreated diabetic rats. This finding can only be explained by concurrent \n\nlipogenesis and ?-oxidation, which is actually supported by CPT1a expression \n\nlevels in the range found for untreated diabetic rats and lower than those of \n\ncontrols. Evidence demonstrating the loss of reciprocal regulation between \n\nDNL and ?-oxidation has been reported in hepatocytes overexpressing wild \n\ntype and malonyl-CoA-insensitive (at a greater extent) CPT1a, even under \n\nfeeding-like conditions of high insulin and high glucose (Akkaoui et al. 2009). \n\nMoreover the sensitivity of CPT1a to malonyl-CoA is decreased in diabetic \n\nrats and is only modestly reverted by acute administration of high insulin \n\ndoses (Grantham et al. 1988). The present study provides additional evidence \n\nthat lipogenesis and ?-oxidation may occur simultaneously and furthermore \n\ninsulin replacement may promote the cycling of lipids between those two \n\npathways in the diabetic rats. \n\n \n\n5.4.4 Relevance of the intraperitoneal route \n\nUnder physiological conditions, the liver receives insulin and nutrients \n\nby the portal vein during the absorptive phase. In these studies, the i.p. route \n\nwas chosen as a strategy to target insulin to the liver and the absorptive phase \n\nwas addressed after the insulin replacement period. It was anticipated that the \n\n\n\n114|Chapter 5 \n \n\nhepatic metabolic pathways would respond differently to the i.p. and s.c. \n\nroutes of insulin administration. However, most of the effects observed in the \n\nfed state were independent of the route of administration. The only apparent \n\ndifference was that when insulin was delivered to the i.p. route hepatic \n\nglycogen synthesis was further enhanced relative to the s.c. route. However, \n\nthis observation was not supported by differently altered gene expression or \n\nenzyme activity of GK, which exerts high positive control over glycogen \n\nsynthesis (Ferrer et al. 2003). It is possible that the lag phase between the last \n\ninsulin injection and liver harvesting time prevented route-related effects to be \n\nnoticed at the level of enzyme regulation. With continuous insulin diffusion \n\npumps, the i.p. route resulted in increased stimulation of GK activity relative \n\ndo s.c. and even non-diabetic controls (Mason et al. 2000). Interestingly, \n\nanother study from the same group reports the activity of lipogenic enzymes \n\nis enhanced to the same extent by both routes (Mason et al. 2002). Hence, at \n\nleast in the in the absorptive state, portal insulin is more relevant in the \n\nnormalization of glycogen synthesis, probably via GK regulation.  \n\n \n\n5.5 Conclusions \n\nDelivering insulin in two daily doses to either the s.c. or i.p. route was \n\nbeneficial to the overall condition of STZ-diabetic rats. Glycolytic and \n\nlipogenic fluxes in the liver were highly responsive to the treatment but \n\ngluconeogenesis and lipid degradation could not be normalized, probably as a \n\nconsequence of the insufficient insulinization throughout the whole day. \n\nPreferential hepatic action could not be clearly demonstrated for the i.p. route \n\nexcept for the higher glycogen content in the liver that, nonetheless, was not \n\naccompanied by other differential improvements. \n\n \n\n\n\n|115 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n6                                                                                                     \nPOLYMERIC NANOPARTICLES FOR INSULIN DELIVERY \n\n6.1 Introduction \n\nAn important issue regarding the current insulin therapy is that its \n\ndelivery by the s.c. route fails to recapitulate the hormone\u2019s physiological \n\nrelease profile, since the portal to peripheral gradient is unmet under those \n\ncircumstances. Oral insulin delivery would mimic the normal secretion of \n\ninsulin because the drug would be largely absorbed to the portal vein. \n\nHowever, because of its peptide nature, oral insulin administration is \n\nhampered. Poor absorption and high enzymatic degradation of peptide and \n\nprotein agents are the main barriers compromising their efficacy by the oral \n\nroute (Pauletti et al. 1996; Uekama et al. 1998; Pinto Reis et al. 2006). Even \n\nafter reaching circulation, these drugs are rapidly cleared from the blood, \n\nand their presence may also lead to immunological complications (Uekama \n\net al. 1998). In this context, nanoparticles arise as specialized delivery \n\nsystems being developed by several research groups with encouraging \n\n\n\n116|Chapter 6 \n\nresults in regards to enhancing the oral efficacy of peptide drugs (e.g. \n\nAll\u00e9mann et al. 1998; Bilati et al. 2005a; Pinto Reis et al. 2006).  \n\nNanoparticles are colloidal carriers ranging in size from 10 to 1000 \n\nnm. They are used in drug formulation for facilitating the passage of drugs \n\nthrough the biological membranes, protecting drugs against degradation, \n\ncontrolling drug release and targeting to specific sites of action. Once in the \n\nbody, nanoparticles are recognized as strange entities, undergo opsonisation \n\n(coating with opsonin protein) that flags them to phagocyte cells and are \n\neventually delivered to organs of the reticuloendothelial system. Unloaded \n\nbiodegradable nanoparticles are mainly taken up by the liver (42 to 80% of \n\nthe administered dose), spleen (0,6 to 2%), lungs (0,7 to 3%) and to a less \n\nextent by the bone narrow (All\u00e9mann et al. 1993). This extensive uptake is \n\nadvantageous when the therapeutic agent is intended to act on those organs \n\nand can thus be used as means of passive targeting drugs to the liver, for \n\nexample.  \n\nConcerning the above mentioned, a hypothesis can be set that \n\nphysiological/portal delivery of insulin may be achieved by the \n\nnanoparticle strategy if: (i) the drug is successfully absorbed by the oral \n\nroute; (ii) or passive liver targeting occurs even under the traditional s.c. \n\nadministration. To test this hypothesis, nanoparticles with high insulin \n\nassociation were prepared from biodegradable and biocompatible materials \n\nand assayed for efficacy against the administration of free insulin. In the \n\nfollowing paragraphs, some methodological considerations regarding the \n\nmaterials chosen to develop the nanoparticles are addressed. \n\nFrom the wide variety of polymers available for preparing \n\nnanoparticles, poly-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) has the advantage of being \n\nbiodegradable.  \n\nAmong the various methods available for preparing nanoparticles, \n\nthe nanoprecipitation technique employs mild conditions and is the most \n\nsimple and straightforward. In this procedure a polymer is dissolved in an \n\norganic medium (typically acetone) and, upon contact of this solution with a \n\nnon-solvent phase (typically water), the polymer immediately suffers \n\n\n\nNanoparticles for insulin delivery|117 \n\ndesolvation resulting in the formation of nanoparticles. In a second step the \n\norganic solvent is removed by evaporation and the nanoparticles are \n\nobtained as an aqueous colloidal suspension. The most common way to \n\nassociate drugs to nanoparticles prepared by this methodology is to add the \n\ndrug along with the polymer to the organic solvent. While this is a good \n\nprocedure for hydrophobic molecules, it is not very suited for the \n\nformulation of hydrophilic compounds, such as insulin. Nonetheless, \n\nnanoprecipitation has been successfully used to prepare insulin-loaded \n\nPLGA nanoparticles by dissolving the drug in hydrochloride acid and then \n\nadding that solution to the polymer-containing acetonic phase (Barichello et \n\nal. 1999a, 1999b; Cui et al. 2007). Alternatively, Bilati et al using a modified \n\nnanoprecipitation method have obtained insulin-loaded PLGA \n\nnanoparticles by dissolving the drug and the polymer in DMSO or N-\n\nmethylpyrrolidone (Bilati et al. 2005b). In the authors\u2019 method, the \n\nnanoparticles are recovered after centrifugation and successive washes with \n\ndistilled water. \n\nCyclodextrins (CD) are cyclic oligosaccharides consisting of several \n\nD-glucopyranose units linked to each other by ?-1,4 bonds (Figure 25A). \n\nNatural occurring CDs are obtained from the enzymatic breakdown of \n\nstarch by bacterial amylase cyclodextrin-glucosyl-tranferase and the most \n\nabundant are ?-, ?- and ?-CD, consisting of 6, 7 and 8 glucopyranose \n\nresidues respectively. Cyclodextrins assume a cone shaped form (Figure \n\n25B) with the polar hydroxyl groups facing the outside, primary hydroxyl \n\nresidues linked to C6 are in the narrowest face while secondary ones linked \n\nto C2 and C3 are localized on the wider face. These hydroxyl groups can \n\nsuffer chemical modifications and be conjugated with other functional \n\ngroups to alter the physicochemical properties of parent CD. Hence, CD and \n\ntheir derivatives cover a wide range of pharmaceutical applications and \n\nhave been largely used in drug delivery as adjuvant to improve drug \n\nsolubility, stability, and bioavailability (Loftsson et al. 2007). \n \n \n \n\n\n\n118|Chapter 6 \n\n \n                                        A                                                                         B \n\n                        \n \nFigure 25 The chemical structure of ?-CD.

Reproduced \nfrom Loftsson et al. (Loftsson et al. 1996). \n\n \n\nAbout twenty years ago, new CD derivatives with amphiphilic \n\ncharacter were synthesized by Zhang and co-workers (Zhang et al. 1991). \n\nSimilar to polymers, these molecules are able to self-assemble into \n\nnanoparticles by the nanoprecipitation technique. This new amphiphile \n\nclass of CD has extended the pharmaceutical potential of CD to the domain \n\nof the nanocarrier systems. Several chains can be grafted to the CD parent \n\nmolecule at different positions (Duch\u00eane et al. 1999), and recently, the \n\nthermolysin catalyzed transesterification of CD with vinyl esters allowed \n\nthe synthetic procedure to be simplified to a quantitative one-step reaction \n\n(Pedersen et al. 2005; Choisnard et al. 2006).  \n\nThis chapter describes the preparation of insulin-loaded \n\nnanoparticles from PLGA and amphiphilic CD. The aim was to develop a \n\nnew nanoparticle-based carrier for oral and/or s.c. administration of insulin \n\nthat would translate in benefits with respect to the pharmacological \n\nresponse. From the most common ?- ?- and ?-CD, the latter is the less toxic \n\n(Loftsson et al. 2007) and was hence chosen to prepare an amphiphilic \n\nderivative to be included in the nanoparticle formulation. The amphiphilic \n\nCD consisted of a ?-CD backbone grafted with C10 chains from vinyl \n\ndecanoate and was synthesized by enzyme catalysis. Insulin was not added \n\nto the polymer/amphipilic CD-containing solvent but rather to the non-\n\n\n\nNanoparticles for insulin delivery|119 \n\nsolvent aqueous phase. Still, good association of insulin to the nanoparticles \n\ncould be observed. The relevance of the nanosystem for insulin delivery in \n\nvivo, was studied in several experimental settings that aimed to evaluate the \n\nhypoglycemic response upon oral and s.c. administration to non-diabetic \n\nand STZ-diabetic rats. \n\n \n\n6.2 Materials and methods \n\n6.2.1 Synthesis and characterization of amphiphilic \n\ncyclodextrins \n\nParent ?-CD (Roquette, France) was grafted C10 alkyl chains by a \n\nthermolysin-based catalysis as previously described (Choisnard et al. 2006). \n\nBriefly, ~1 g of ?-CD dissolved in 7.5 mL of DMSO plus 2.3 mL of vinyl \n\ndecanoate (99%; TCI Europe nv, Interchim, France), were let to react at 45 \u00baC \n\nfor 8 days in the presence of 1 g of thermolysin (Sigma Aldrich, France) \n\npreviously immobilized in celite. At the end of the reaction, the celite-\n\nthermolysin deposit was eliminated by centrifugation and cyclodextrin \n\nesters in the supernatant were precipitated by adding 20 mL of 35% (v/v) \n\nmethanol in water. After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, the \n\nproduct solubilized in tetrahydrofuran and further purified by successive \n\nacetonitrile precipitation, filtration and re-solubilization in tetrahydrofuran. \n\nThis procedure was repeated three times. Finally the ?-CD capric esters (?-\n\nCDC10) were dissolved in acetone and recovered as a white powder after \n\ndrying under vacuum. MALDI-MS: m/z = 2399.11 (relative intensity, 33%; \n\ndecanoate ?-CD ester with 7 chains + Na+); m/z = 2553,31 (relative intensity, \n\n100%; decanoate ?-CD ester with 8 chains + Na+); m/z = 2707.48 (relative \n\nintensity, 54%; decanoate ?-CD ester with 9 chains + Na+); m/z = 2861.66 \n\n(relative intensity, 15%; decanoate ?-CD ester with 10 chains + Na+). 1H \n\nNMR (600 MHz; DMSO-d6): ?

Typically, 5 mL of acetone containing \n\nthe nanoparticle-forming material was poured over 6.5 mL of a polysorbate \n\n80 (Montanox\u00ae 80, Seppic, France) aqueous solution (0.015% m/v) under \n\nmagnetic stirring, in a closed system thermostatized at 25 \u00baC. Nanoparticles \n\nwere spontaneously formed, the organic solvent and part of the water were \n\nremoved by evaporation under vacuum and particles were recovered as an \n\naqueous colloidal suspension (approximately 5 mL). To prepare insulin-\n\nloaded nanoparticles, 300 \u00b5L of an insulin commercial preparation \n\n(Actrapid\u00ae, Novo Nordisk, France) equivalent to 30 U of insulin were \n\nadded to the aqueous phase prior nanoprecipitation to prevent possible \n\ndenaturation resulting from contact with acetone.

The signals in the \n\nMALDI-MS analysis were separated by 154 mass units, corresponding to \n\nthe molecular mass of the decanoate chain. The most abundant species in \n\nthe mixture was acylated with 8 C10 chains. This profile may represent one \n\nor more acylations per glucopyranose unit that composes the CD. The \n\npresence of species with 9 and 10 acylations indicates some glucopyranose \n\nunits were acylated in at least three carbons. Acylation can occur via the \n\nprimary C6 hydroxyl or the secondary C2 and C3 hydroxyls. Enzymatic \n\ncatalysis is reported to lead mainly to acylation in C2 however, the grafting \n\nof other positions is not to be excluded (Pedersen et al. 2005; Choisnard et al. \n\n2006). The NMR analyses of the ?-CDC10 product (Figure 28 and Figure 29) \n\nfurther clarified the substitution profiles in the mixture, namely in what \n\nconcerns the positions that were attacked during the transesterification \n\nreaction.  \n\n\n\nNanoparticles for insulin delivery|127 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 28 HMQC spectrum of ?-CD in DMSO-d6.

Hence, \n\nsubstitution in position 6 is unlikely to have occurred. The most significant \n\nshift from the parent ?-CD was observed for the H2 resonance, which \n\nmoved downfield from 3.30 to 4.42 ppm, translating in an altered H2/C2 \n\ncorrelation. This downfield shift is consistent with a strong deshielding \n\neffect due the ester function in the C2 position. All the other positions \n\nexperienced a modest downfield shift in 1H, which indicates the presence of \n\nan additional electronegative environment in the vicinity of H3, H4 and H5 \n\nand is consistent with the C2 acylation. Nonetheless, the presence of species \n\nwith 9 and 10 acylations implies that C3 was also acylated at least to some \n\nextent. The presence of an extra correlation peak at 4.59/70.43 ppm supports \n\nthe presence of species acylated in C3, with the H3 moving downfield from \n\n3.59 ppm in the parent ?-CD and from 3.78 ppm in the C2 acylated species.  \n\n \n\n                                A                                                               B \n \n\n \nFigure 30 (A) Chemical structure of the ?-CDC10 amphiphilic cyclodextrin.

Despite the differences on the \n\ncomposition of the organic phase, all the uncoated formulations rendered \n\nnanoparticles of similar sizes. The average mean diameter ranged from 112 \n\nto 126 nm. Moreover, these observations indicate that PLGA and ?-CDC10 \n\nco-nanoprecipitated in formulation from the PLGA-?-CDC10 blend and this \n\nwas further confirmed by TEM photographs (Figure 31) that show spherical \n\nparticles in good agreement with the size measurements by QELS. \n\nAs described in section 6.2.2, insulin-loaded nanoparticles were \n\nprepared by adding a commercially available insulin formulation \n\n(Actrapid\u00ae) to the system. This formulation consists of an aqueous neutral \n\nsolution of insulin and because its contact with acetone resulted in \n\nimmediate turbidity observed by the naked eye, suggesting the integrity of \n\nthe protein to be compromised, Actrapid\u00ae was added to the aqueous phase. \n\nWhen the nanoparticles were prepared from ?-CDC10 alone, ~80% of the \n\ninsulin added to the system could be recovered in the aqueous supernatant \n\nafter centrifugation, with less than 20% remaining associated to the particles \n\n(Table 19).

On the other hand, when insulin \n\nformulations were administered to the animals, the hypoglycemic effect was \n\nimmediate, overcoming the initial stress-induced raise in glycemia, \n\nalthough statistically significant differences were only attained from 0.5 \n\nhours onward. The AAC for all the insulin formulations were significantly \n\nhigher than controls and placebo formulations, as expected. \n\nWhen animals were injected with the standard insulin formulation \n\n(Actrapid\u00ae), glycemia decreased progressively until a minimum value (29 \u00b1 \n\n6 mg/dL) observed at time t = 2 hours, and 2 hours later animals had regain \n\nnormoglycemia. Furthermore, the glycemia curve for ACTR group was \n\ncharacterized by a peak-like shape with a minimum at t = 2 hours. In \n\ncontrast, for both nanoparticle formulations, the negative peak was \n\nsmoothen and the curves assumed a rounder shape, enlarging the interval \n\nfor the minimum, which in these cases was sustained from t = 0.5 hours \n\n(corresponding to 45 \u00b1 6 mg/dL, PL-I and 39 \u00b1 3 mg/dL, CDPL-I) to t = 2 \n\nhours (corresponding to 43 \u00b1 5 mg/dL, PL-I and 36 \u00b1 2 mg/dL, CDPL-I). \n\nThese observations suggest both formulations from PLGA and PLGA-?-\n\nCDC10 blend were able to modulate insulin\u2019s hypoglycemic effect that was \n\nsustained during that interval. These results are in good agreement with \n\nBarichello et al. experiments, in which the authors observe a similar \n\nsustentation for the minimum glycemia following the s.c. injection of \n\ninsulin-loaded nanoparticles from PLGA (Barichello et al. 1999b). Moreover, \n\nit was observed an earlier onset on the hypoglycemic effect for animals \n\nadministered the formulation containing ?-CDC10 along with PLGA (p &lt;\n\n0.01 vs ACTR at t = 0.5 hours) as well as a prolonged effect, still detected 6 \n\nhours past the injection (p &lt;0.05 vs all other groups).

Upon the injection of the commercial insulin formulation, glycemia \n\ndecreased progressively but, unlike the observations for the non-diabetic \n\ncontrols that could rapidly recover from the insulin-induce hypoglycemia, \n\nthis lowering effect was sustained up until t = 4 hours. As discussed in \n\nchapter 3, this is probably due to the lack of appropriate glucagon response \n\nin the diabetic rats (Zhou et al. 2004).

Insulin \n\ninjection prior to the OGTT successfully prevented the raise in glycemia \n\nobserved for the STZ-diabetic rats not injected with the hormone (Figure \n\n38). This effect was independent of the formulation. In fact, the AUC \n\ndetermined for ACTR (116 \u00b1 10) was similar to that of CDPL-I (98 \u00b1 12) and \n\nboth were significantly lower than that of STZ-diabetic animals (339 \u00b1 51).  \n\nAt the beginning of the study, glycemia values after 24 hours of \n\nfasting were 252 \u00b1 29 mg/dL for the STZ-diabetic rats, significantly higher \n\nthan those observed for non-diabetic controls (65 \u00b1 4 mg/dL, see chapter 2). \n\nThree hours after the oral glucose load, glycemia in the STZ group remained \n\nelevated (336 \u00b1 41 mg/dL) when comparing with ACTR and CDPL-I \n\n0 2 4 6 8\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\nACTR\n\nCDPL-I\n\nTime (hours)\n\nG\nly\n\nce\nm\n\nia\n(%\n\n fr\no\n\nm\n b\n\na\nsa\n\nl)\n\n\n\n138|Chapter 6 \n\ngroups.

A \n\nnovel formulation for insulin delivery was obtained by combining two \n\nstrategies in the pharmaceutical technology field: the use of polymeric \n\nnanoparticles and modified cyclodextrins. An important achievement of this \n\nwork was the preparation of nanoparticles from two different materials \n\nwith the ability to self-assemble individually. The nanoprecipitation \n\ntechnique allowed for both the PLGA polymer and the amphiphilic CD \n\nderivative ?-CDC10 to co-nanoprecipitate and form mixed nanoparticles. \n\nThis system presented excellent association of insulin, which was due to the \n\npresence of the polymer in the matrix of the nanoparticle.  \n\n \n\n6.4.2 Biological relevance for the inclusion of ?-CDC10 in the \n\ninsulin nanoparticles \n\nThe biological relevance of polymeric (from PLGA only) and mixed \n\n(from the PLGA-?-CDC10 blend) formulations was first investigated in non-\n\ndiabetic controls. Those assays showed that both the nanoparticle \n\nformulations were able to modulate insulin action towards a more sustained \n\nhypoglycemic response in contrast with the peak observed when insulin \n\nwas administered as a simple solution. This effect may result from a \n\nprogressive release of insulin associated to the particles and/or a \n\nprogressive absorption of the particles from the subcutaneous region to the \n\nblood stream. Following s.c. administration, nanoparticles and drugs are \n\nsubjected to an absorption barrier eventually reaching systemic circulation \n\nvia the blood capillaries or lymph vessels. Polymeric (Owens III et al. 2006) \n\nand CD esters-based (G\u00e8ze et al. 2007) nanoparticles accumulate mainly in \n\nliver and spleen upon intravenous injection. On the other hand, studies with \n\nsolid lipid nanoparticles (Reddy et al. 2005) indicate that, in the case of s.c. \n\n\n\n140|Chapter 6 \n\ninjection, deposition of nanoparticles in the administration site is \n\nresponsible for delaying and lowering tissue accumulation. In this \n\nexperiment it could be observed a rapid hypoglycemic effect following the \n\nsubcutaneous administration of the insulin-loaded nanoparticles, which is \n\nconsistent with progressive release of the drug from the carrier to the blood, \n\nwith the latter remaining at the administration site, similarly to the reports \n\nfrom studies with solid lipid nanoparticles. On the other hand, the late effect \n\ndetected at 6 hours could be attributed to insulin released from \n\nnanoparticles that reach the blood after a delayed absorption. It is possible \n\nthat the presence of ?-CDC10 in the formulation promoted the passage of the \n\nnanoparticles to the blood allowing for the 6th hour-effect to be noted for \n\nthis system and not for the one prepared from PLGA alone. Since many CD \n\nderivatives are used in drug delivery as means to promote drug absorption \n\n(Sharma et al. 2005) it can be hypothesized that the CD esters in the \n\nnanoparticles may act as absorption enhancers.  \n\n \n\n6.4.3 Insulin-carrier interactions and the oral delivery \n\nThe excellent association of insulin to the nanoparticles was not \n\ncompromised when the formulations were diluted in water, under those \n\ncircumstances ~90% of the amount added to the system remain associated \n\nto the carrier. However, upon the s.c. injection of the nanoparticle \n\nformulations to non-diabetic rats, most of the biological effect was observed \n\nin the first 2 hours, suggesting the interactions between insulin and the \n\nnanoparticle carrier are easily broken in vivo resulting in the fast (although \n\nsustained) release of the drug from the carrier. When insulin was added to a \n\npre-formulated suspension of sham nanoparticles the resulting association \n\nefficacy was similar to that observed when the nanoparticles were prepared \n\nin the presence of insulin. Taken together these observations support \n\nadsorption interactions between insulin and hydrophilic PLGA to be the \n\nmajor forces accounting for the drug\u2019s association to the nanoparticle \n\nsystem. This behavior most probably is a consequence of the \n\n\n\nNanoparticles for insulin delivery|141 \n\nnanoprecipitation method, which employs very mild conditions. In other \n\nwords, nanoparticles fail to afford a sufficient protection of the drug \n\nbecause the adsorption interactions accounting for insulin\u2019s association to \n\nthe carrier can be easily disrupted in vivo. Moreover, the weak nature of the \n\ninsulin-carrier interaction is in perfect agreement with the lack of efficacy \n\nupon oral administration of the nanoparticles.  \n\nOn the other hand, there are some reports on the efficient delivery of \n\ninsulin by the oral route by means of PLGA-based particles. For example, \n\nCui et al. prepared insulin-loaded PLGA nanoparticles by nanoprecipitation \n\nand afforded to avoid the initial burst effect (i.e. the rapid release of insulin) \n\nby including a cellulose derivative for enteric coating in the formulation \n\n(Cui et al. 2007). Alternatively, Naha et al. report that microparticles \n\nprepared by the double emulsion method coated with Eudragit\u00ae effectively \n\ndeliver insulin to the oral route (Naha et al. 2008). The coating strategy was \n\nalso pursued in the studies described in this chapter. Eudragit\u00ae L30D55 was \n\nused as enteric coating but, despite the reduction on insulin release in acidic \n\nmedium in vitro, the coated formulations did not translate into any \n\nhypoglycemic effect upon oral administration. Manufacture aspects such as \n\nthe method of nanoparticle preparation or the amount of polymers in the \n\nsystem may be preventing the oral efficacy of the formulation, relative to \n\nthe experiments from Cui et al. and Naha et al. above mentioned. However, \n\nincreasing the PLGA concentration or the amount of coating material \n\ncompromised the formation of nanoparticles by the method described in \n\nthis chapter. \n\n \n\n6.4.4 Effect of insulin nanoparticles in the STZ-diabetic rat \n\nWhen the mixed nanoparticles from PLGA and ?-CDC10 were tested \n\nin STZ-diabetic rats, no differences could be observed when comparing its \n\neffect with that of the commercial insulin formulation. In the STZ-diabetic \n\nrat, the hypoglycemic period following insulin injection was longer than \n\nthat observed in non-diabetic controls. These animals take more time to \n\n\n\n142|Chapter 6 \n\nrecover from insulin-induced hypoglycemia because of the lack of \n\nappropriate glucagon response to hypoglycemia (Zhou et al. 2004; Cui et al. \n\n2007). In their studies, Zhou et al. demonstrate that for normal glucagon \n\nsecretion to occur both hypoglycemia and a discontinuation of the insulin \n\nsignal to the ? cell (switch off hypothesis) are required (Zhou et al. 2004). \n\nHence, because the physiology of the STZ-diabetic rats is quite distinct from \n\nthat of non-diabetics a single insulin injection translates into different \n\nkinetics in the hypoglycemic response. Thus, the nanoparticle-induced \n\nsustained and prolonged hypoglycemic response that was observed in the \n\ncase of the non-diabetic controls was probably masked in the STZ-diabetic \n\nrats due to the already prolonged insulin-induced hypoglycemia.  \n\nThe efficacy of the nanoparticles was yet investigated in the context \n\nof a glucose challenge and again no clear benefits could be attributed to the \n\nnanoparticle formulation for insulin delivery in STZ-diabetic rats.  \n\n \n\n6.5 Conclusions \n\nA novel nanoparticle system for s.c. insulin delivery with high \n\ninsulin association efficacy was successfully prepared form a mixture of \n\nPLGA and an amphiphilic cyclodextrin derivative (?-CDC10). The biological \n\naction of insulin could be enhanced by the use of the formulation, especially \n\nwhen the cyclodextrin derivative was present. This effect was observed in \n\nnon-diabetic control rats but not in STZ-diabetic animals. The findings from \n\nthese experiments were strongly dependent on the animal model used. \n\nBecause of the altered physiology of the STZ-diabetic rat, modest \n\nimprovements in insulin delivery such as the ones observed in these studies \n\nmay not be detected. \n\nIn drug development, animal studies usually follow an exhaustive \n\nset of assays that have established an optimized formulation. In these \n\nstudies, animal experiments were moved slightly upstream and re-\n\nformulation was done in accordance with inputs from animal studies. This \n\n\n\nNanoparticles for insulin delivery|143 \n\nallowed for re-addressing the oral route with the coating approach that \n\nunfortunately didn\u2019t prove to be effective. Nonetheless, the nanoparticles \n\nfrom PLGA and ?-CDC10 promise to be a good carrier for insulin delivery \n\nand further formulation development should be undertaken aiming to \n\nstrengthen the interaction between insulin and the nanoparticle matrix.

In the liver, insulin stimulates glycogen and \n\nlipid synthesis and inhibits glucose output after meals. These studies \n\naddressed postprandial hepatic metabolism in control and diabetic rats. In \n\nall the experiments, hyperglycemia in diabetic rats was accompanied by \n\nweight loss, consistent with impairments in glucose disposal and energy \n\nstorage. Tracer-based experiments and NMR spectroscopy methods \n\nprovided insight into the mechanisms underlying the metabolic disruptions \n\nresulting from the lack of insulin action.  \n\nThe transition from fasted to fed state is a rapid event and efficient \n\nshort-term mechanisms must operate to readjust the hepatic metabolic \n\nfluxes from a positive glucose output to net storage under those \n\ncircumstances. This setting was investigated in the carbohydrate challenge \n\nexperiments described in chapters 2 and 3. In non-diabetic control rats, the \n\ngluconeogenic flux accounting to maintain EGP during the fasting period \n\n\n\n146?Chapter 7 \n \n\nwas diverted to glycogen synthesis and this actually constituted the major \n\nsource of glycogen in the context of the glucose challenge. Direct conversion \n\nof load glucose contributed to ~30% of the glycogen synthesis but this \n\nfraction was reduced when other preferential substrate such as galactose \n\nwas present. Hence, hepatic glycogen is a highly dynamic pool that \n\nconstitutes a \u201cfirst line\u201d response in the recuperation of glucose homeostasis \n\nafter nutritional challenges. Efficient glycogen deposition was parallel to a \n\nrapid clearence of glucose from the blood, and at the end of the test, EGP \n\naccounted for the majority (~75%) of plasma glucose in non-diabetic rats. \n\nThis mechanism is necessary to avoid hypoglycemia resulting from a \n\ncontinuous glucose uptake from the blood. Under natural feeding \n\nconditions, with constant glucose provision from food intake, EGP \n\ncontributed to only 40% of plasma glucose. \n\nDiabetic rats have high rates of EGP essentially due to unrestrained \n\ngluconeogenesis.  Their hepatic glycogen levels do not fall during fasting \n\ndemonstrating an inability to mobilize hepatic glycogen stores for glucose \n\nproduction. Nonetheless, under normal feeding conditions there was a \n\nsignificant turnover of hepatic glycogen in the diabetic rats, indicating that a \n\nfutile cycle of glycogen breakdown and synthesis is taking place. In non-\n\ndiabetic controls the depletion/replenishment are harmonized with the \n\nfasting/(re)feeding cycles but that dynamic is no longer observed in the \n\ndiabetics. Without insulin, the hepatic glycogen pool was unresponsive to \n\nfasting, at least in the 24-hour period. Moreover, it also lost the capacity to \n\nreceive the gluconeogenic flux in response to a glucose load. \n\nIn diabetic rats, inefficient glycogen deposition after a glucose load \n\nwas parallel to elevated EGP and reduced clearance form the blood, \n\nresulting in persistent hyperglycemia at the end of the 3-hour glucose \n\ntolerance test. A single insulin dose had no effect on improving glycogen \n\nsynthesis in that context but efficiently controlled the contribution of EGP to \n\nplasma glucose levels. However, the most striking action of insulin was to \n\nstimulate peripheral glucose uptake. As a consequence, plasma glucose \n\n\n\nConcluding remarks|147 \n\nlevels decreased drastically and the animals were in fact hypoglycemic for \n\nat least 3-hours after the load. \n\nAfter a period of insulin replacement for 10 days, pathways for \n\nenergy storage were enhanced but diabetic animals still experienced \n\nabnormal catabolic events like high gluconeogenic and lipolytic fluxes \n\nduring feeding. This could be a consequence of insufficient or inappropriate \n\ninsulinization and other therapeutic protocols should be studied to \n\ndetermine whether an efficient glycemic control by insulin replacement is \n\nable to normalize all the metabolic disruptions in diabetic rats. With the \n\ninsulin treatments applied, the pathways for hepatic glycogen synthesis in \n\nthe diabetic rats were restored to control levels but the hepatic glycogen \n\ncontent was only completely recovered when insulin was delivered to the \n\ni.p. route. Thus, targeting insulin to the liver translated into differential \n\nbenefits on the hepatic glycogen storage. TG metabolism was also sensitive \n\nto insulin replacement, which translated into a reduction of plasma TGs and \n\nan increase in de novo hepatic TGs. \n\nIn the context of insulin formulation development, animal studies \n\nare simple and straightforward assays that measure a specific \n\npharmacological response, which in the case of insulin typically is the \n\nhypoglycemic effect. These assays are important in establishing the \n\nbiological interest of a particular formulation and should be integrated with \n\nformulation re-assessments for optimizing drug delivery. In the \n\nexperimental work of this thesis, a novel nanoparticle formulation for \n\ninsulin delivery was developed and its biological relevance demonstrated in \n\na simple animal experimental setting, but those findings were not \n\nreproduced when a more complex diabetic rat model was studied and \n\nfurther formulation development is required. After \n\nformulation/reformulation studies, animal experiments should include the \n\nassays for addressing the hepatic metabolic effects of insulin in the \n\npostabsorptive state to determine whether liver-targeted insulin action can \n\nbe afforded. \n\n\n\n\n\n|149 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nAcheson, KJ, Y Schutz, T Bessard, K Anantharaman, J-P Flatt and E J\u00e9quier (1988) Glycogen \nstorage capacity and de novo lipogenesis during massive carbohydrate overfeeding \nin man.
