Scolymus, usually known as artichoke, is a Mediterranean \n\nspecie with therapeutic properties, including antioxidant activity. This plant is a rich \n\nsource of polyphenols, including caffeoylquinic and dicaffeoylquinic acids. The use of \n\nbioactive ingredients or phytochemicals extracted from plant tissues in cosmetics is \n\nincreasing, thus artichoke extract due to its constituents can be incorporated in topical \n\nformulations. \n\nThe artichoke extract used in this study was obtained through an infusion technique, a \n\nconventional method in which dried leaves are placed in boiling water for a short period \n\nof time. Aqueous artichoke extract was characterized by high-performance liquid \n\nchromatography\u2013diode array detector and a quantification of several constituents present \n\nin it, like proteins, carbohydrates, polyphenols and dietary fibers, was performed. Two \n\npurification strategies were adopted, including a gastric digestion followed by a dialysis \n\nthat resulted in artichoke fraction A and a mucilage precipitation method. In this last \n\nmethod, two different assays were performed, one using acetic acid and the other without \n\nthe use of acetic acid, resulting in artichoke fractions B and C, respectively. The purify \n\nfraction with higher polyphenols content was artichoke fraction C, which was chosen \n\namong all. The content of total phenols and tannins were determined along the \n\npurification processes, as well as the antioxidant activity. \n\nArtichoke Extract and Artichoke Fraction C were subjected to ROS scavenging activity \n\nand MTT cytotoxicity assays in HaCaT cell lines, being both good antioxidants and non-\n\ntoxic. Sun protection factor (SPF) was also measured in both fractions and the artichoke \n\nextract showed the highest SPF. \n\nThese fractions were incorporated in O/W emulsions and hydrogels for topical \n\napplication. Chemical and physical characterization and microbiological control, as well \n\nas cytotoxicity and membrane integrity assays, were performed on the products to ensure \n\ntheir quality and safety.  \n\nThe formulations containing the artichoke extract were considered the best choice \n\naccording with the in vitro studies realized and the costs and time of production of each \n\nfraction, so these were chosen to proceed with the study. \n\n\n\nV \n\n \n\nROS scavenging activity assays of the formulations containing artichoke extract showed \n\npowerful antioxidant activities. In vivo studies, including a human repeat insult patch \n\ntesting (HRIPT) and an assessment of the protective effect against oxidative stress after \n\nUV radiation by chromameter evaluation, showed very good skin compatibility and no \n\nallergenic potential for all formulations, and according to the antioxidant activity assay, \n\nthe artichoke gel was the formulation that presented a true in vivo antioxidant activity.  \n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the antioxidant properties of artichoke extract in \n\ntopical formulations.  \n\n \n\nKey words: Cynara Cardunculus var.

Scolymus, usualmente conhecida por alcachofra, \u00e9 uma esp\u00e9cie \n\npertencente \u00e0 fam\u00edlia Asteraceae e \u00e9 caracter\u00edstica da regi\u00e3o Mediterr\u00e2nea, sendo um dos \n\nvegetais amplamente consumidos nessa regi\u00e3o. Assim, esta esp\u00e9cie representa uma \n\nimportante fonte de rendimentos para a agricultura e economia dos pa\u00edses mediterr\u00e2neos, \n\nsendo Espanha, Fran\u00e7a, It\u00e1lia e Gr\u00e9cia respons\u00e1veis por mais de 45% da produ\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nmundial de alcachofra. \n\nA alcachofra \u00e9 maioritariamente composta por \u00e1gua, prote\u00ednas, l\u00edpidos, hidratos de \n\ncarbono, inclusive inulina, fibras e a\u00e7ucares, mas tamb\u00e9m apresenta na sua constitui\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nminerais e vitaminas. Esta esp\u00e9cie \u00e9 ainda altamente rica em polifen\u00f3is, especialmente \n\nem derivados de \u00e1cido cafeoilqu\u00ednico, como \u00e9 o caso do \u00e1cido clorog\u00e9nico (3-O-\u00e1cido \n\ncafeoilqu\u00ednico) e da cinarina (1,3-\u00e1cido cafeoilqu\u00ednico), e ainda em flavonoides como o \n\ncinar\u00f3sido (7-O-gluc\u00f3sido de luteolina). Estes s\u00e3o respons\u00e1veis pela atividade \n\nantioxidante associada \u00e0 alcachofra, sendo que quanto maior o seu conte\u00fado em \n\npolifen\u00f3is, maior a sua capacidade antioxidante. Para al\u00e9m da sua atividade antioxidante, \n\na alcachofra \u00e9 conhecida pelas suas amplas propriedades terap\u00eauticas: coler\u00e9tica, \n\nhepatoprotetora, anticarcinog\u00e9nica, antibacteriana, antif\u00fangica, anti-inflamat\u00f3ria e anti \n\nenvelhecimento.  \n\nOs compostos bioativos presentes em tecidos vegetais, tais como os polifen\u00f3is, s\u00e3o \n\nextra\u00eddos atrav\u00e9s de in\u00fameras t\u00e9cnicas, sendo que este processo depende de diversos \n\nfatores, como \u00e9 o caso do pH, solubilidade, tempo de extra\u00e7\u00e3o e temperatura. A escolha \n\ndo m\u00e9todo de extra\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 fundamental e de extrema import\u00e2ncia uma vez que influencia a \n\ntaxa de extra\u00e7\u00e3o, o rendimento e a pureza dos compostos extra\u00eddos. A infus\u00e3o \u00e9 um \n\nm\u00e9todo de extra\u00e7\u00e3o convencional, no qual as folhas da esp\u00e9cie em causa s\u00e3o introduzidas \n\nem \u00e1gua a ferver por um curto per\u00edodo de tempo, sendo o tempo de extra\u00e7\u00e3o e a \n\ntemperatura os par\u00e2metros com maior impacto. Estes m\u00e9todos de extra\u00e7\u00e3o resultam em \n\nfra\u00e7\u00f5es com elevado n\u00edvel de impureza. Assim, a purifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos extratos atrav\u00e9s da \n\nremo\u00e7\u00e3o de materiais maioritariamente inertes \u00e9 uma op\u00e7\u00e3o que visa a obten\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nfra\u00e7\u00f5es com propriedades melhoradas, incluindo a atividade antioxidante. A digest\u00e3o \n\n\u00e1cida com suco g\u00e1strico seguida de uma di\u00e1lise e a precipita\u00e7\u00e3o de mucilagens presentes \n\nnos extratos vegetais s\u00e3o duas estrat\u00e9gias de purifica\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\n\n\nVII \n\n \n\nA aplica\u00e7\u00e3o destes compostos em produtos cosm\u00e9ticos tem vindo a aumentar devido \u00e0 \n\nproibi\u00e7\u00e3o de utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de ingredientes de origem animal e \u00e0 procura de produtos naturais \n\ne sustent\u00e1veis. \n\nAs formula\u00e7\u00f5es t\u00f3picas que t\u00eam por base extratos de origem vegetal t\u00eam como principais \n\nfun\u00e7\u00f5es a prote\u00e7\u00e3o da pele contra efeitos ex\u00f3genos e end\u00f3genos prejudiciais, e a \n\nmanuten\u00e7\u00e3o do equil\u00edbrio hidrolip\u00eddico da pele. E estas podem ser l\u00edquidas, tais como \n\nsuspens\u00f5es, solu\u00e7\u00f5es ou emuls\u00f5es, ou semiss\u00f3lidas, como \u00e9 o caso de pomadas, cremes e \n\ngeles. As formula\u00e7\u00f5es semiss\u00f3lidas s\u00e3o prefer\u00edveis, dado que os ingredientes bioativos \n\nquando incorporados nestas podem ter a\u00e7\u00e3o nas camadas mais superficiais ou nas \n\ncamadas mais profundas da pele, dependendo das caracter\u00edsticas f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmicas dos \n\ningredientes bioativos e da finalidade das formula\u00e7\u00f5es, e ainda devido ao seu \n\ncomportamento reol\u00f3gico. A qualidade, seguran\u00e7a e efic\u00e1cia destes produtos s\u00e3o \n\navaliadas atrav\u00e9s de diversos par\u00e2metros f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmicos, como o pH, homogeneidade e \n\ntextura, atrav\u00e9s controlo microbiol\u00f3gico e estudos de irritabilidade cut\u00e2nea, de \n\ncitotoxicidade e de estabilidade, e ainda por par\u00e2metros biom\u00e9tricos, tais como perda \n\ntransepid\u00e9rmica de \u00e1gua, hidrata\u00e7\u00e3o, refor\u00e7o da barreira cut\u00e2nea, elasticidade, entre \n\noutros.  \n\nO objetivo deste trabalho foi estudar as propriedades antioxidantes do extrato de \n\nalcachofra e a sua utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o como ingrediente para produtos cosm\u00e9ticos antioxidantes.  \n\nO presente estudo utilizou folhas de alcachofra, as quais foram submetidas a um processo \n\nde infus\u00e3o, de filtra\u00e7\u00e3o e liofiliza\u00e7\u00e3o com o intuito de extrair e estabilizar o extrato de \n\nalcachofra. A caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o do extrato de alcachofra foi realizada atrav\u00e9s de m\u00e9todos de \n\nquantifica\u00e7\u00e3o espec\u00edficos e revelou que este \u00e9 constitu\u00eddo por 62.8% de fibras diet\u00e9ticas \n\nsol\u00faveis e insol\u00faveis, 3 % de polifen\u00f3is, 0.82% de hidratos de carbono e 0.002% de \n\nprote\u00ednas. \n\nDuas estrat\u00e9gias de purifica\u00e7\u00e3o foram adotadas visando o melhoramento das atividades \n\nantioxidantes do extrato de alcachofra: digest\u00e3o \u00e1cida seguida de uma di\u00e1lise com dura\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde 24 horas que resultou na fra\u00e7\u00e3o A, e precipita\u00e7\u00e3o de mucilagens, na qual se testou \n\nainda a import\u00e2ncia da utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1cido ac\u00e9tico, que resultaram nas fra\u00e7\u00f5es B \n\n(utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1cido ac\u00e9tico) e C (aus\u00eancia de \u00e1cido ac\u00e9tico). Os extratos aquosos \n\nprocedentes das purifica\u00e7\u00f5es, bem como o extrato aquoso de alcachofra, foram analisados \n\n\n\nVIII \n\n \n\natrav\u00e9s de cromatografia l\u00edquida de alta efici\u00eancia (HPLC-DAD) com o intuito de \n\nacompanhar os processos de purifica\u00e7\u00e3o e de dosear a cinarina, o \u00e1cido clorog\u00e9nico e o \n\ncinar\u00f3sido presente em cada fra\u00e7\u00e3o. Estes compostos foram identificados em todas as \n\nfra\u00e7\u00f5es estudadas, sendo que o extrato de alcachofra demonstrou ser o mais rico.  \n\nA atividade antioxidante de todas as fra\u00e7\u00f5es foi avaliada atrav\u00e9s do ensaio com o radical \n\nlivre 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). Todas as fra\u00e7\u00f5es apresentaram atividade \n\nantioxidante, sendo que a fra\u00e7\u00e3o que apresentou o melhor resultado foi a fra\u00e7\u00e3o C, \n\nresultante da precipita\u00e7\u00e3o de mucilagens sem a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1cido ac\u00e9tico, com um EC50 \n\nde 56 \u00b5g/mL.  \n\nO extrato de alcachofra e a fra\u00e7\u00e3o C foram estudados de forma mais detalhada. A sua \n\natividade antioxidante foi ainda avaliada atrav\u00e9s de ensaios in vitro em queratin\u00f3citos, \n\nnos quais foram utilizados como agentes oxidativos o per\u00f3xido de hidrog\u00e9nio e radia\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nUV. Ambas as fra\u00e7\u00f5es n\u00e3o apresentaram diferen\u00e7as significativas relativamente ao \u00e1cido \n\nasc\u00f3rbico no caso da radia\u00e7\u00e3o UV, mas apresentaram ligeiras diferen\u00e7as no caso do \n\nper\u00f3xido de hidrog\u00e9nio.   \n\nO fator de prote\u00e7\u00e3o solar (FPS) foi determinado, tendo-se obtido um FPS de 10.99 para o \n\nextrato de alcachofra e 10.20 para a fra\u00e7\u00e3o C. A citotoxicidade foi tamb\u00e9m avaliada e \n\napesar de se ter observado redu\u00e7\u00e3o da viabilidade celular, os extratos foram considerados \n\nseguros. \n\nAmbas as fra\u00e7\u00f5es foram incorporadas em dois tipos de formula\u00e7\u00f5es t\u00f3picas: emuls\u00f5es \n\nO/W e geles. Ambas as formula\u00e7\u00f5es foram desenvolvidas com a m\u00e1xima simplicidade \n\nposs\u00edvel, tendo-se utilizado apenas os ingredientes essenciais de forma a diminuir \n\nposs\u00edveis efeitos secund\u00e1rios provocados por algum ingrediente presente. Para cada \n\nformula\u00e7\u00e3o foi realizada uma caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmica (pH, viscosidade), e um \n\ncontrolo microbiol\u00f3gico. O pH ligeiramente ac\u00eddico, entre 5.4 e 6.4, as propriedades \n\nreol\u00f3gicas e a quase total aus\u00eancia de fungos e bact\u00e9rias nos produtos cosm\u00e9ticos \n\ndesenvolvidos, revelaram que estes s\u00e3o adequados e seguros para o uso t\u00f3pico.  \n\nNos ensaios de citotoxicidade das formula\u00e7\u00f5es em queratin\u00f3citos observou-se uma \n\ndiminui\u00e7\u00e3o da viabilidade celular associada \u00e0s formula\u00e7\u00f5es que continham os \n\ningredientes bioativos relativamente aos seus respetivos brancos. A n\u00edvel da integridade \n\nmembranar, apenas os cremes revelaram diferen\u00e7as significativas quando comparados \n\n\n\nIX \n\n \n\ncom o seu branco. Assim, as formula\u00e7\u00f5es foram consideradas biocompat\u00edveis e seguras \n\npara o uso t\u00f3pico.  \n\nTendo em conta os resultados dos estudos in vitro e os custos e tempo de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ncada fra\u00e7\u00e3o (extrato de alcachofra e fra\u00e7\u00e3o C), foi decidido testar apenas as formula\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ncontendo o extrato de alcachofra nos seguintes estudos in vitro e nos estudos in vivo.  \n\nAs atividades antioxidantes das formula\u00e7\u00f5es com o extrato de alcachofra incorporado \n\nforam avaliadas atrav\u00e9s de ensaios in vitro em queratin\u00f3citos, nos quais se utilizou \n\nper\u00f3xido de hidrog\u00e9nio e radia\u00e7\u00e3o UVB como indutores de stress oxidativo. Os resultados \n\ndemonstraram que ambas as formula\u00e7\u00f5es, creme e gel, apresentam atividades \n\nantioxidantes elevadas. Nos estudos in vivo, foram realizados um Human Repeat Insult \n\nPatch Testing (HRIPT) e um ensaio para determinar o efeito de prote\u00e7\u00e3o das formula\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ncontra stress oxidativo induzido por radia\u00e7\u00e3o UV. Os resultados demonstraram que ambas \n\nas formula\u00e7\u00f5es, o creme e o gel, apresentam uma boa compatibilidade cut\u00e2nea, e que \n\napesar de ambas as formula\u00e7\u00f5es possu\u00edrem a capacidade de diminuir a atividade oxidante \n\nprovocada pela radia\u00e7\u00e3o UVA, apenas o gel de alcachofra demonstrou uma atividade \n\nantioxidante verdadeira.  \n\nO processo de infus\u00e3o demonstrou ser um m\u00e9todo eficaz na extra\u00e7\u00e3o de polifen\u00f3is da \n\nalcachofra. O mesmo ocorreu para os processos de purifica\u00e7\u00e3o realizados, uma vez que \n\nestes conseguiram melhorar as atividades antioxidantes de cada fra\u00e7\u00e3o, mesmo daquelas \n\ncom um menor conte\u00fado de polifen\u00f3is. Atrav\u00e9s de ensaios in vitro, as formula\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ndesenvolvidas com os extratos eleitos revelaram ser adequadas e seguras para o uso \n\nt\u00f3pico. Posteriormente, estudos in vivo tamb\u00e9m demonstraram que estas formula\u00e7\u00f5es \n\neram dermatologicamente seguras, uma vez que n\u00e3o apresentaram rea\u00e7\u00f5es adversas na \n\npele nem potencial efeito alerg\u00e9nico. Para al\u00e9m disso, estes estudos comprovaram de \n\nnovo o potencial antioxidante da alcachofra, sendo que o gel que continha o extrato de \n\nalcachofra apresentou atividade antioxidante in vivo. \n\nEste estudo demonstrou assim o potencial da alcachofra para ser introduzido em produtos \n\ncosm\u00e9ticos com finalidades antioxidantes e anti envelhecimento.  \n\n \n\nPalavras-Chave: Cynara Cardunculus var.

Chapter: Introduction \n \n\n1.1. Cynara Cardunculus var. Scolymus \n\n1.1.1. The Domestication of Artichoke \n\nThe artichoke was already known and cultivated at the beginning of the Christian era [1]. \n\nThe first mention to this specie was made by Theophrastus, the Greek (371-287 BCE), \n\nwho described artichoke cultivation in Sicily and Southern Italy [2], and in 77 EC the \n\nmedical benefits of this plant were reported by the Roman Pliny the Elder (ad 23\u201379, in \n\nNaturalis Historia). However, it\u2019s estimated that domestication of artichoke only occurred \n\nbetween 800 and 1 500 CE, possibly in monastery gardens [3]. Records point Filippo \n\nStrozzi as the first merchant of this specie, who was responsible for trading artichokes \n\nfrom Sicily to Florence in the beginning of 15th century [4]. \n\n \n\n1.1.2. Taxonomy and Botanical Description  \n\nCynara cardunculus var. scolymus, usually known as globe artichoke, belongs to the \n\nfamily Asteraceae, subfamily Carduoideae and genus Cynara. Wiklund used a cladistics \n\nmethod based on morphological characterization to search the ancestry of Cynara crops \n\nand the results showed that the cultivated artichoke (C. Cardunculus var. Scolymus), leafy \n\ncardoon (C. cardunculus var. Altilis) and wild cardoon (C. Cardunculus var. Sylvestris) \n\nare included in a single species: C. Cardunculus L. [5]. A more recent study analyzed the \n\nphyletic relationships between Cynara species by using internal transcribed spacer \n\nsequences of the ribosomal regions, and the results were nearly in accordance with the \n\nphylogeny proposed earlier by Wiklund [6]. In Figure 1.1 are represented harvested \n\nartichokes and its habitat. \n\n       \nFigure 1.1 - Harvest globe artichokes at left and plant habit of globe artichoke at right. Illustrations removed from \n\nEdible Medicinal And Non-Medicinal Plants. \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\nThe globe artichoke is a perennial herbaceous plant, up to 80-180 cm tall, characterized \n\nby greyish green and deeply lobed leaves up to 75 cm in length. The flower heads are 5-\n\n10 cm in diameter and consists of green bracts surrounding violet florets. Both bracts and \n\nflorets are attached to a receptacle, commonly known as the heart [7]. \n\nAt first the leaves of the globe artichoke are rosulate, but later they sprout and adopt an \n\novate-lanceolate shape. These leaves are silvery-grey, pinnatifid and normally large, up \n\nto 50 cm long by 20 wide. This specie is characterized by a voluminous ovate capitula, \n\nusually known as the head, which is characterized by a violet-blue flower that is placed \n\non the top of the flowering stem, up to 1.5 m. This head is composed of thick, fleshy \n\nbracts called phyllaries (involucral bracts), which are broadly ovate and green or tinged \n\nwith purple or wholly purple, and a fleshy base of the receptacle, also called heart. These \n\nare the edible parts of globe artichoke. \n\n \n\n1.1.3. Agroecology  \n\nGlobe artichoke has a wide adaptive range of 7-30\u00b0C, being a cool-season crop. \n\nTherefore, it should be planted in areas with day and night temperatures between 20-22\u00b0C \n\nand 12-14\u00b0C, respectively. This specie is very sensible to lower temperatures, and severe \n\nof frequent frosts can damage or kill it; but it tolerates well high temperatures (>30\u00b0C), \n\nthough it tends to decrease the quality of artichoke heads. It also requires long periods of \n\nsunlight, having a critical photoperiod of 10.5 hours [8]. \n\nThe transition from vegetative to reproductive phase in seed-planted individuals depends \n\non the interaction between the size of the plant, low temperatures and photoperiod. This \n\ntype of artichoke has deep-rooted and can grow in several varieties of soils. However, it \n\ngrows best on deep, fertile and well-drained soils with a pH range of 6-8. It requires a \n\nraised-bed culture when drainage of the field isn\u2019t known, since globe artichoke dislikes \n\nwater-logged soils [8]. \n\n \n\n1.1.4. Geographic Distribution  \n\nMediterranean diet is characterized by a high consumption of vegetables, fruits, cereals \n\nand olive oil, which provide numerous micronutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, fibers \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nand polyphenols [9]. The artichoke is one of those vegetables, and it is consumed raw, \n\nboiled, steamed or fried, and therefore it\u2019s used in numerous recipes [10]. \n\nThis plant plays an important role in the agriculture and economy of the Mediterranean \n\nregion, with a production of 199 900 t in Spain, 36 423 t in France, 547 799 t in Italy and \n\n28 600 t in Greece; it is also produced on a large scale in the North Africa \u2013 777 671 t. \n\nGlobal production is approximately 1 793 016 t, making Mediterranean countries \n\nbelonging to Europe \u2013 France, Spain, Italy and Greece \u2013 responsible for over 45% of \n\nartichoke production, which makes it a source of income that is helping the economy in \n\nthis region [11].  \n\n \n\n1.1.5. Phytochemistry \n\nThe head of globe artichoke corresponds to 30-40% of its fresh weight [12] and the \n\nreceptacle accounts for 33-55% of the head [13]. A raw globe artichoke is manly \n\ncomposed of water (84.94%); but it also contains proteins (3.27%), ash (1.13%), fat \n\n(0.15%), carbohydrates (10.51%), including inulin (1.8%), fibers (5.4%) and sugars \n\n(0.99%), such as glucose, fructose and sucrose. Minerals (0.66%) and vitamins (0.049%) \n\nare as well important components [14], [15].  \n\nCarbohydrates are polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones or substances that can originate \n\nsuch compounds through hydrolysis reactions, and they may be divided into three major \n\nclasses: monosaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. Plant polysaccharides \n\ncan be classified into storage polysaccharide (e.g. inulin; the body can digest), cell-wall \n\npolysaccharides (e.g. cellulose; the body can\u2019t digest it) and gums and mucilage. \n\nStructural fibers make up the plant cell walls and include lignin, cellulose, hemicelluloses \n\nand pectins.  \n\nGlobe artichoke has high content of carbohydrates, including the storage polysaccharide \n\ninulin. Inulin is a fructan-type polysaccharide that consists of (2?1) linked ?-d-fructosyl \n\nresidues (n = 2\u201360), usually with an (1?2) ?-d-glucose end group (degree of \n\npolymerization ranging from 2 to 60 or more). Previous studies report a content between \n\n1.8 and 2.5% of inulin in this plant [16], [17].  Fibers are also one of the most abundant \n\nconstituents in the artichoke, namely cellulose and lignin. Cellulose is an unbranched \n\nglucose water-insoluble polymer with around 3 000 glucose units and it is the most widely \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\ndistributed component of plant cell walls, and lignin is phenylpropane polymers \n\nsynthetized from coumatyl, coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols. Artichoke fibers are composed \n\nof 75.3 % of cellulose and 4.3% of lignin, being a rich-fiber plant [18]. Chemical structure \n\nof some compounds present in artichoke are showed in Figure 1.2. \n\n \n\n \n\nPhenolic compounds are one of the biggest and widely distributed groups of secondary \n\nmetabolites in plants. All polyphenols share a common origin, the amino acid \n\nphenylalanine, which is deaminated to cinnamic or converted to tyrosine, and then it \n\nenters the phenylpropanoid pathway. Therefore, phenolic compounds have as a common \n\ncharacteristic, the presence of at least one aromatic ring hydroxyl-substituted. The \n\npolyphenols can be classified into simple phenols, hydroxybenzoic acid and \n\nhydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, flavonoids, stilbenes, lignans and hydrolyzable as well \n\nas condensed tannins. These compounds are usually bounded to other molecules, \n\ncommonly sugars and proteins, but they also exist in a small quantity in their free form, \n\npossibly due to its toxicity when in free state. They play an important role in plants, \n\nInulin  \n\nCellulose   \n\nLignin \n\nFigure 1.2 - Representative compounds present in the artichoke: inulin, lignin and cellulose. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nnamely in sensorial properties (color, aroma, taste and astringency), structure, pollination, \n\nresistance to pests and defense from predators and in grow, germinative and reproduction \n\nprocesses. According to literature, the outer and inner bracts, the receptacle and the leaves \n\nof globe artichoke contain polyphenols [10], [19], but its content can be influenced by the \n\nharvest time. The phenolic content can increase up to 16 times from winter to Spring \n\nharvest, especially in floral stem [20].  \n\nZhu et al. [21] identified four caffeoylquinic acid derivatives, chlorogenic acid, cynarin, \n\n3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid and 4,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid, and four flavonoids, \n\nluteolin-7-rutinoside, cynaroside, apigenin-7-rutinoside and apigenin-7-O-?-D-\n\nglucopyranoside in artichoke leaf extracts, and Fal\u00e9 et al. [22] also identified cynaroside \n\n(luteolin-7-O-glucoside) and luteolin-7-O-(6\u2019\u2019malonylglucoside). However, the \n\nartichoke extract is mainly composed of caffeoylquinic and dicaffeoylquinic acids, being \n\nthe most abundant  cynarin (1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid) and chlorogenic acid (3-O-\n\ncaffeoylquinic acid)) [19], [23]. Chemical structure of some phenolic compounds present \n\nin artichoke are showed in Figure 1.3. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCynarin \n\nCynaroside \n\nChlorogenic acid \n\nFigure 1.3 - Representative phenolic compounds in artichoke: cynarin, cynaroside and chlorogenic acid. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\n1.1.6. Therapeutic Properties \n\nArtichoke dried leaves have been used as a medicinal herb in traditional medicine for \n\ncenturies because of its choleretic and hepatoprotective [24], anticarcinogenic[25], \n\nantioxidant [19], [22], [26], antibacterial [21], antifungal [27], anti-inflammatory [28] and \n\nantiphotoaging properties [29]. \n\nThe hepatoprotective activity of artichoke was tested in isolated rat hepatocytes against \n\nCCl4 toxicity and the results revealed that cynarin and caffeic acid act in glutamine \n\noxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) and glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GTP), consequently \n\nshowing hepatoprotective properties, while isochlorogenic acid and cynaroside act only \n\nin the GOT activity. Quinic acid and chlorogenic acid didn\u2019t alter the toxicity of CCl4 \n\n[30]. Another study showed that the artichoke leaf extract with the highest content in \n\nphenolic compounds exerted a more significant effect on bile flow and liver protection, \n\nbut the results also showed that the administration of cynarin and chlorogenic acid as pure \n\ncompounds didn\u2019t revealed hepatoprotective or choleretic properties [24]. The \n\ninvestigators suggested that caffeoyl derivates have an important role in therapeutic \n\nproperties of artichoke, but when administrated in their pure form, they aren\u2019t effective. \n\nMileo et al. [31] investigated the chemopreventive properties of artichoke edible parts \n\nthrough cytotoxicity assays on several cell lines and the results showed a similar level of \n\ntoxicity in breast cancer cell lines but not any notable effects, even at high concentrations, \n\non normal breast epithelial cells. This effect is due to the combined activities of several \n\nbioactive compounds present in the edible part of artichoke, since a study demonstrated \n\nthat the artichoke extract has a faster and more pronounced apoptotic activity than the \n\npure chlorogenic acid [32]. \n\nThrough the measurement of the lag phase prolongation of conjugated diene formation, \n\nthe decrease in the rate of propagation and a sparing effect on the a-tocopherol within the \n\nlow density lipoprotein (LDL), artichoke extract showed to have the capacity to retard \n\nLDL oxidation in a dose-depend way. Pure luteolin revealed a lipid peroxidation \n\ninhibition similar to 20 \u00b5g/mL of artichoke extract, and luteolin-7-O-glucosine also \n\nshowed a dose-dependent inhibition of LDL oxidation but was less effective than luteolin. \n\nStudies of cooper-chelating properties of these compounds suggested a potential role in \n\nthe antioxidant activity of artichoke extract [33]. Artichoke has an EC50 of 123.1 \u00b1 5.7 \n\n\u00b5g/mL for DPPH scavenging activity and its biochemical activities (acetylcholinesterase \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\ninhibition and DPPH scavenging activity) remain similar after gastric and pancreatic \n\ndigestions [22].  \n\nIn order to examine the antimicrobial activities of artichoke leaf extract, three fractions \n\nof it in different solvents, chloroform, ethyl acetate and n-butanol, were tested by disk \n\nassays. The results demonstrated that at least six types of bacteria, including B. subtilis, \n\nS. aureus, A. tumefaciens and M. luteus, and five fungi, including C. albicans, S. \n\ncereVisiae, S. carlsbergensis, A. niger and P. oxalicum, were susceptible to all artichoke \n\nfractions [21]. However, C. lusitaniae and M. mucedo were only susceptible to n-butanol \n\nfraction and C. cucumerinum was sensitive only to n-butanol and chloroform fractions. \n\nTherefore, the n-butanol fraction was considered the most active to all microorganisms \n\ntested. In the same study, eight phenolic compounds were isolated from n-butanol \n\nfraction, including chlorogenic acid, cynarin, 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid, 4,5-di-O-\n\ncaffeoylquinic acid, luteolin-7-rutinoside, cynaroside, apigenin-7-rutinoside and \n\napigenin-7-O-?-D-glucopyranoside, and the compounds that showed a higher \n\nantimicrobial activity were the chlorogenic acid, the cynarin, cynaroside and luteolin-7-\n\nrutinoside. In following studies, artichoke leaf extract also showed antifungal activity \n\nagainst 7 foodborne bacterial pathogens, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, \n\nAgrobacterium tumefaciens, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella \n\ntyphimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 yeasts, Candida albicans, Candida \n\nlusitaniae , Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharo myces carlsbergensis , and 4 molds, \n\nAspergillus niger , Penicillium oxalicum , Mucor mucedo and Cladosporium \n\ncucumerinum [27]. \n\nA group of 10 albino mice were administrated via oral with 10% infusion (dry plant) or \n\n20% (fresh plant) corresponding to 1 or 2 g/kg of several plants, and the analgesic and \n\nanti-inflammatory activities were measured by the number of contortions and Evans blue \n\ndye diffusion to the peritoneal cavity, respectively [34]. From 10 plants tested, artichoke \n\nwas one of the two plants that showed powerful anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities \n\n[28]. In other study, elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines in blood serum of \n\npatients with chronic viral hepatitis C were normalized after using artichoke preparations \n\nduring the medical rehabilitation period.  \n\nCynaropicrin is a bioactive sesquiterpene lactone and its content in artichoke extracts \n\nranges between 0.44-1.60 % [35]. The administration of this compound found to be \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\neffective against photoaging of the skin through the inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa \n\n(NF-?B)-mediated transactivation of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and the matrix \n\nmetalloprotease-1 (MMP-1) in a dose-dependent manner [29]. NF- ?B is normally \n\nretained in the cytoplasm as an inactive complex but it is activated by UV radiation, which \n\ninduces bFGF and MMP-1 production [36], [37]. Was also confirmed that in an in vivo \n\nmouse model, cynaropicrin is able to prevent skin photoaging, which is traduced in a \n\nhyperproliferation of melanocytes and keratinocytes [29]. \n\n \n\n1.1.7. Artichoke Waste Phytochemicals \n\nThe waste produced by the artichoke processing industry, such as leaves, outer bracts and \n\nstems, can form up to 80-85% of total biomass of the material, and it is normally used as \n\norganic mass, animal feed [38], and fuel [39] and fiber production [40].  \n\nIn the artichoke waste were reported 45 phenolic compounds, including gallic acid; \n\ncaffeoylquinic acid 1,2 and 3; dicaffeoylquinic acids 1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7; protocatechuic \n\nacid; esculin; chlorogenic acid; p-coumaric acid-O-glucoside isomers 1 and 2; \n\neriodictyolglucuronide; rutin (quercetin-3-O-rutinoside); dicaffeoylquinic acid \n\nderivative; hyperoside (quercetin-3-O-galactoside); luteolin-7-O-rutinoside; cynaroside \n\n(luteolin-7-O-glucoside); isoquercitrin (quercetin-3-O-glucoside); luteolin-7-O- \n\nglucuronide; luteolin-7-O-galactoside; naringenin-O-hexoside; avicularin (quercetin-3-\n\nO-arabinoside); isorhoifolin (apigenin-7-O-rutinoside); quercetin-O-pentoside; quercitrin \n\n(quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside); luteolin-7-O-neohesperidoside; apigenin-O-glucoside; \n\nprunin (naringenin-7-O-glucoside); naringin (naringenin-7-O-neohesperidoside); \n\nscolimoside (luteolin-7-O-rhamnoside); apigenin-7-O-glucuronide; quercetin-O-\n\npentoside; phloridzin (phloretin-2-O-glucoside); feruloylquinic acid-O-glucoside; \n\nluteolin; quercetin; naringenin; and apigenin chrysoeriol. Among all components, \n\ncaffeoylquinic and dicaffeoylquinic acids showed to be the main components of artichoke \n\nwaste [41]. \n\nKnowing the therapeutic properties of all artichoke components combined, the actual use \n\nof artichoke by-products is questionable and since it has several health benefits, \n\nalternatives for its use should be considered. Production of natural nontoxic food \n\nadditives, neutraceuticals or cosmetics using artichoke as bioactive ingredient are some \n\noptions for the use or artichoke by-products.  \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\n1.2. Purification Methods \n\nExtraction is the separation of active ingredients of plant tissues from the inactive or inert \n\ncompounds through the use of selective solvents in standard extraction techniques.  The \n\nplant extracts obtained are still a relatively impure liquid, semisolid or powders and \n\ninclude several chemical compounds with different functions and structures, such as \n\npolyphenols [42]. The extraction of polyphenols from leaves depends on many factors \n\nincluding pH, solubility, extraction time and temperature [43]. However, the extraction \n\nmethod has effects on the rate, yield and purity of these compounds, so the method choice \n\nis crucial. \n\nInfusion is a conventional method, in which dried leaves are placed in boiling water for a \n\nshort period of time. The temperature and extraction time are parameters with impact in \n\nthe total polyphenol content and consequently in antioxidant activity [42]. Liang et al. \n\n[44] investigated the influence of temperature on the extraction efficiency and \n\ndegradation of polyphenols in green tea. The results showed that at a temperature of \n\n100\u00b0C, the green tea catechins suffered alterations on their configuration to their isomers, \n\nand at 80\u00b0C the catechins epimerization was inhibited. Therefore, the extraction should \n\nbe executed at a temperature between 80 and 100\u00b0C. Another study showed that a \n\nprolonged extraction period leads to the degradation of a large fraction of flavonoids \n\npresent in green tea [45]. The investigators concluded that the conventional procedure of \n\npouring boiling water to the cup with the herbal leaves and let it rest for 10 minutes is the \n\nproper way to infuse the herbs. This extraction technique is usually followed by a \n\nfiltration procedure in order to separate the plant tissues from the solution containing the \n\nbioactive compounds. The vacuum filtration is a well-know and simple method that \n\nconsists in passing the stream through a porous filter, which is capable of retaining the \n\nsolids. This filtration requires a pressure drop in order for the liquid to flow through the \n\nfilter, and this pressure can be achieved by creating a vacuum or a centrifugal force, by \n\nraising the pressure more than the atmospheric pressure or by designing to make use of \n\ngravitational force [46]. The vacuum filtration schematic is represented in Figure 1.4. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\nTo finalize the active substances extraction procedure from herbs, a lyophilization of the \n\nherb infusion is required to remove its water content, which enhances its stability. To \n\nproceed to the lyophilization, the herbal infusion needs to be frozen in order to separate \n\nthe solvent from the solutes, since the water forms ice crystals and the solutes will be \n\nconfined in the interstitial region between those crystals. Then the pressure in the system \n\nis reduced and heat is applied to the frozen herbal infusion, which will lead to the \n\nsublimation of the ice crystals formed previously. A dried mixture, usually named cake, \n\nis the result of this process, but it may contain 5-10% (w/w) of water adsorbed onto its \n\nsurface. In some cases, if the water content in the cake is still too high and consequently \n\nits stability isn\u2019t the desired, a second drying is performed through the increasing of \n\ntemperature and reducing of partial pressure of water vapor in the container [47]. The \n\ndiagram of a lyophilization is represented in Figure 1.5. \n\n \n\nFigure 1.5 - Diagram of lyophilization steps of a liquid formulation. Figure 1.5.1. shows the liquid formulation, which \n\nis market by \u2018A\u2019, in a glass container with the lyophilization closure positioned for the drying process; Figure 1.5.2. \n\nshows the frozen ice-product matrix of the formulation, which is market by \u2018B\u2019; Figure 1.5.3. represents the primary \n\ndrying process and the interstitial cake portion is denoted by region market as \u2018C\u2019; Figure 1.5.4. illustrated the \n\ncompletion of secondary drying.

Illustration removed from Biosolids Tratment Processes. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nThe herbal extracts obtained from the previous method are still impure, so a purification \n\nis required in order to enhance its properties, including the antioxidant activity. Two \n\ndifferent approaches can be followed in order to purify the herb infusion: gastric digestion \n\nfollowed by dialysis and mucilage precipitation. \n\nTagliazuchi et al. [48] investigated the bio-accessibility of the major classes of \n\npolyphenols from Red Globe grapes through an in vitro model that simulated some \n\nchemical (pH, temperature and bile salts) and biological (gastric and pancreatic enzymes) \n\ngastro-intestinal conditions. The investigators concluded that the content of bio-\n\naccessible polyphenols, flavonoids and anthocyanins increases during gastric digestion, \n\nand that the gastric digestion has no effect on the stability of polyphenols. Therefore, it is \n\nadvantageous to perform a gastric digestion of infusions in order to increase its bio-\n\naccessible polyphenols content, which will consequently improve its health benefits. \n\nAfterwards, a dialysis is required to separate the polyphenols from other large and \n\ncomplex molecules present in the herbal infusion, and consequently purify it. Dialysis is \n\na separation method, based on the differential diffusion, of solutes with different \n\nmolecular size through a membrane. This procedure is considered slow but it is efficient \n\nin separating small solutes from large molecules, and due to its simplicity, it is a method \n\nof choice. In this technique, the solution to be dialyzed is inserted in a dialysis membrane \n\nand then it is placed in a container with water for some hours or even days. In this process, \n\na way of stirring the solutions is advisable and for that purpose, a magnetic stirred can be \n\nused to gently move continuously the dialysis membrane [49]. \n\nAnother purification method is the precipitation of mucilage, a polysaccharide mixture \n\nthat can be found in plant tissues of higher plants, present in herbal infusions. Kim et al. \n\n[50] investigated the effects of pectic mucilage removal from cactus cladodes (Opuntia \n\nhumifusa Raf) and the results showed that along with the mucilage elimination occurs an \n\nincrease of total polyphenols, and since these compounds contribute to antioxidant \n\nactivity, it also resulted in an enhanced antioxidant activity.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\n1.3. Oxidative Stress in Skin  \n\nThe skin covers the entire surface of our bodies and it corresponds approximately to 15% \n\nof total adult body weight, being the biggest organ in human body [51]. It consists of \n\ndifferentiated cells and tissues that perform several functions in our body, such as defense \n\nagainst other organisms, maintenance of body temperature and protection from external \n\nenvironment [52]. The protection of external physical, chemical and biological \n\naggressions is due to a complex structure that has different tissues, like epithelial, \n\nconnective, vascular, muscular and nervous, which are organized in three distinct layers: \n\nepidermis, dermis and hypodermis [51]. The skin also has several specialized structures \n\nwith different functions called appendages (sebaceous, eccrine sweat and apocrine glands, \n\nand hair follicles). The epidermis is a tough stratified epithelium composed of cells with \n\ndifferent embryonic origins, such as melanocytes, Langerhans cells, Merkel cells and \n\nmostly keratinocytes. It exhibits a progressive differentiation (keratinization and \n\ncornification) from the basal to the surface, which results in different appearances of cells \n\nfrom one layer to another [52]. Basal cells are attached to an underlying basal lamina in \n\nthe innermost layer, and above this one is the stratum spinosum composed of prickle cells. \n\nUpward is a thin layer consisting of granular cells - stratum granulosum - which form a \n\nwaterproof barrier, being this one of the most vital functions of the epidermis. This layer \n\nis attached to the outermost layer called corneal stratum, which consists of dead cell with \n\nno intracellular organelles. This cells rich in keratin are connected by a thin and tough \n\nlayer of proteins, including cytoplasmic protein involucrin [53]. Epidermis is associated \n\nwith some appendages like pisosevaceous follicles and sweat glands [51]. Skin layers are \n\nrepresented in Figure 1.6. \n\nFigure 1.6 - Basal cell layer (B), spinous layer (S), granylar layer (G) and stratum corneum in a hemtoxylin and eosin \n\nstains section of normal skin. Illustration from Freinkel et al, 2001. \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nBelow the epidermis is the dermis, a connective tissue component of the skin that protects \n\nthe epidermis and provides elasticity and support [51]. The dermis has less cells than the \n\nepidermis and it is composed of fibrous molecules, dermal cells, a ground substance, \n\nappendances, neurovascular networks and sensory receptors. Its function is to protect the \n\nbody from physical injuries, to retain water, regulate the temperature and it has receptors \n\nof sensory regulation [52]. It has a continuous turnover system that regulates the synthesis \n\nand degradation of its protein and it\u2019s composed of the papillary and reticular layers [54]. \n\nPapillary layer is the upper layer and it is formed of thin collagen fibrils that form thicker \n\ncollagen fibers [54], cells (fibroblasts, dermal dendrocytes, mast cells), vessels and nerve \n\nendings, being this layer the connection between the dermis and epidermis [51]. Bellow \n\nthis one is the reticular layer that is composed mostly of type I collagen and fibers, and \n\nhas only about 15% of dermal collagen which is mostly found in the papillary layer [54]. \n\nThe deepest part of the appendages, vascular and nerve plexures are retain in this last \n\nlayer [51]. The deepest layer of the skin is the hypodermis that serves as a reserve of \n\nenergy, protects the skin from mechanical injuries and has a role in thermoregulation [52]. \n\nThis layer is mostly composed of large adipocytes with a very weakly osmiophilic \n\ncytoplasm, which show pericellular expression of S100 protein and vimentin [51]. The \n\nadipocytes are organized in primary and secondary lobules separated by connective tissue \n\nsepta containing cells, such as fibroblasts, dendrocytes and mast cells [51]. The fat cells \n\nare in continuous renovation through the accumulation of lipids on their inside, \n\nproliferation of adipocytes and recruitment of undifferentiated cells from mesoderm. This \n\ncontinuous system appears to be regulated by a hormone released from adipocytes called \n\nleptin [52]. The hypodermis also accommodates vessels, nerves and the deepest part of \n\nsweat glands [51].  \n\nIn 1955, Denham Harman articulated an innovated biochemistry theory that suggested a \n\ncorrelation between oxygen radicals produced by the cells and the aging process. \n\nAccording to his theory, oxygen radicals such as HO? and HO2? were generated inside \n\ncells, most likely due to the interaction of respiratory enzymes and the molecular oxygen \n\nand to the action of catalase on hydrogen peroxide, and they were responsible for damages \n\nin DNA and proteins, and consequently for the ageing and cancer [55]. Despite the \n\ncontroversy around this theory back in those days, in the present day it is well proved.  \n\nSkin is exposed to several harmful agents, such as ultraviolet (UV) and ionizing radiation, \n\nair pollution and biologic contaminants, that contribute for the production of reactive \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\noxygen species (ROS) in epidermal tissues. ROS are compounds derived from molecular \n\noxygen, O2, but due to chemical reactions they have extra electrons, which make them \n\nunstable. Hydroxyl radicals, HO?, are a result from homolytic cleavage of hydrogen \n\nperoxide, H2O2, and superoxide, O2?, a result of molecular oxygen reduction. These two \n\nradicals and hydrogen peroxide are largely produced by the cells as a result of several \n\nbiological mechanisms [56].  \n\nAmong differentiated cells, human keranocytes are the most exposed to harmful agents, \n\nincluding oxidative stress associated with ROS overproduction, and they are further \n\nmodulated by exposure to UV radiation, chemical compounds, rich-oxygen environment \n\nand inflammatory processes. Orciani et al. [57] determined the susceptibility of isolated \n\nmesenchymal stem cells from human skin (S-MSCs) to oxidative stress and compared the \n\nresults with keratinocytes, which are differentiated cells of the same lineage. Cells were \n\nexposure to H2O2, a stress oxidative inductor, for 2 hours and the oxidative stress effects \n\nwere analyzed after 4, 12, 24 and 48 hours of recovery, and the data reported a greater \n\nantioxidant defense for the keranocytes, while stem cells, which are surrounded by a \n\nprotective environment, weren\u2019t able to overcome oxidative stress. However, human \n\nkeranocytes can still suffer damage at a long-term exposition to harmful agents, like UV \n\nradiation [58]. \n\nAt high levels, ROS can induce damage to cell structures, lipids, nucleic acids and \n\nproteins, which can contribute to mutagenesis, carcinogenesis and ageing [59]. Human \n\norganism have developed several defensive strategies, like preventative and repair \n\nmechanisms, and physical and oxidant defenses [59], but these are not always capable to \n\nrespond to an ROS overproduction and occasionally some errors may occur. Therefore, \n\nthe search for new compounds with the capacity of preventing these oxidative stress \n\nevents is constant.  \n\nUV radiation is divided in three distinct types of radiation: UVC (wavelength 200-280), \n\nUVB (wavelength 290-315nm) and UVA (315-400nm). The UVB and UVC are mostly \n\nfiltered by the ozone layer, therefore only 5-10% of highly energetic UVB reaches the \n\nskin, being the rest UVA radiation [60]. The UVB radiation is mainly absorbed by the \n\nepidermis, while UVA radiation is able to penetrate into the dermis and it also interacts \n\nwith the stratum corneum and epidermis [61]. There are some chromophores in the skin \n\nthat can absorb UV radiation, such as melanin, DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, aromatic \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\namino acids \u2013 tyrosine and tryptophan \u2013 and urocanic acid [62]. This absorption can lead \n\nto several photochemical reactions and secondary interactions with ROS, which can result \n\nin inflammation, photoaging, immunosuppression and skin cancers \u2013 cutaneous \n\nmalignant melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma [61]. UVA and \n\nUVB radiation have different wavelength and therefore, they show distinct properties \n\nconcerning their biological effects on our skin, being UVB radiation more mutagenic and \n\ncytotoxic than UVA. UVA radiation interacts with endogenous photosentisizers resulting \n\nin ROS production, which may cause damage to DNA, proteins and membranes. On the \n\ncontrary, UVB radiation is highly absorbed by DNA resulting in its disruption and the \n\nproduction of photoproducts like cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) and pyrumidone. \n\nA consequence of these photoreactions is the accumulation of defective DNA that can be \n\nthe trigger to mutations of genes that regulate the tissue homeostasis and genome \n\nintegrity, for example the p53 tumor suppressor gene [60]. UVB radiation modifies the \n\nepidermal morphology, including the thickness increase of the corneal stratum, \n\nmodification of cell cohesion and mechanical integrity of corneal stratum and disruption \n\nof the permeability barrier, resulting in transepidermal water loss, changes in the lipids of \n\ncorneal stratum and decreased corneal stratum hydration [61]. \n\nPolyphenols from plant tissues have been described as powerful antioxidants that can \n\nsupport the skin\u2019s own antioxidant defense against oxidative stress when applied topically \n\n[63], [64]. These compounds also have photoprotective properties [65] and sun protection \n\nfactor (SPF), which ranges between 7 and 29 for stilbenes, flavonoids and \n\nhydroxycinnamic acid homologues [66]. \n\n \n\n1.4. Topical Formulations \n\nNowadays, plant extracts are being more used in cosmetic formulation, mostly due to the \n\nprohibition of the use of animal origin ingredients and to an increase search for \n\necofriendly and sustainable products. These plant extracts are very different from purified \n\ntherapeutic agents, since plant extracts are more dilute and usually contain more bioactive \n\ningredients that may be related chemically and therapeutically to the main component \n\nresponsible for the desired effect [67]. The use of bioactive ingredients or phytochemicals \n\nextracted from plant tissues in cosmetics have two major purposes, including body care \n\nand as a source of nutrients for a healthy skin [68].  \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\nIn cosmetics is possible to use the entire plant extract, which is mostly applied according \n\nwith its known therapeutic effects, or selective plant extract, which is used according to \n\nthe investigations studies on its properties [67]. Usually, these botanical products are rich \n\nin vitamins, hydrocolloids, proteins, antioxidants, essential oils and other bioactive \n\ncompounds [69]. Cosmetic formulations containing bioactive ingredients from a natural \n\nsource are designed to protect skin against exogenous or endogenous harmful agents and \n\nto equilibrate the dermal hydrolipid content, which suffers alterations due to ageing and \n\ndermatosis [67].  \n\nTo develop a good formulation, simplicity is required and the shorter the ingredient list, \n\nthe better, since it diminishes the possible adverse effects due to a compound present in \n\nit and the costs of production. The formulation design has to balance the ingredients used \n\nin order to create a product stable and easy to apply, and that maintains its functions \n\nduring manufacturing, on the shelf and during and after application.  \n\nTopical dermatological products can be administered easily and they can be liquid, such \n\nas suspensions, solutions and emulsions, or semisolid, including ointments, gels and \n\ncreams. Active ingredients incorporated in topical formulations can stay on the surface \n\nlayers of tissues or can penetrate into deeper layers, depending on its physicochemical \n\nproperties, its action and the formulation approach. \n\nCreams are semisolid emulsions made with two immiscible liquids, water and oil, in \n\nwhich one is considered the dispersion phase and it is dispersed into the other phase, \n\nwhich acts as the dispersion medium, resulting in a stable dispersion. The main \n\ningredients of these formulations are emollients, humectants, surfactants, preservatives, \n\nchelating agents, perfumes and others. The equilibrium between water and oily \n\ningredients may produce different formulations in order to suit different purposes (skin \n\ntypes, skin conditions, age of user and living environment). Usually, the main functions \n\nof creams are to maintain the moisture balance and keep the skin moist and supple by \n\nsupplying water, humectants and oils [70]. There are two categories of creams according \n\nto the surfactants and oily ingredients used: O/W or W/O emulsions. In O/W emulsions \n\nare used hydrophilic surfactants and the oily ingredients can vary widely from non-polar \n\nto polar. On the contrary, in W/O emulsions are mostly used lipophilic surfactants and \n\nthe oily ingredients are mainly non-polar. The W/O type has been used to increase the \n\noily nature and the O/W type when a light feeling is wanted [70].   \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nGels are a type of base with a uniform external appearance that can vary from transparent \n\nto semitransparent and they provide a moist feeling. These formulations can be divided \n\ninto two categories, aqueous or oily gels. Aqueous gels are used as a base material and \n\nare known for their water supplying, moisturizing and cooling effects. Oily gels supply \n\noil to the skin and have moisturizing properties as well. The main compounds of gels are \n\npolymers and solvents [70]. Polymers are a crucial gel constituent and they can be \n\nclassified based on source (natural, semi-synthetic and synthetic), structure (linear, \n\nbranched chain, crosslinked or network polymer), polymerization type (addition or \n\ncondensation polymers), molecular forces (elastomers, fibers, thermosetting, \n\nthermoplastic), chain growth polymerization (free radicals governed) or degradability \n\n(biodegradable or non-degradable) [71]. Water soluble polymers can be applied in several \n\nindustries, like food, paint, textiles, paper, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, water treatment, \n\namong others, and can be divided into two categories, synthetic or natural. Synthetic \n\nwater soluble polymers can be dissolve, disperse or swell in water and can work as a \n\ngelation, thickening or emulsification/stabilization agent, which result in alterations of \n\nphysical properties of aqueous systems. These include poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), \n\npolyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), Polyacrylamides, Polyacrylic \n\nacid (PAA), N-(2-Hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA), Divinyl Ether-Maleic \n\nAnhydride (DIVEMA), polyoxazoline, Polyphosphates and Polyphosphazenes; and \n\nnatural water soluble polymers include xanthan gum, pectins, chitosan derivatives, \n\ndextran, carrageenan, guar gum, cellulose ethers, hyaluronic acid (HA), albumin and \n\nstarch or starch based derivatives [71]. \n\nThe quality, safety and efficacy of a topical formulation is evaluated by physical and \n\nchemical parameters such as pH, homogeneity, texture, microbiological control, skin \n\nirritation studies, cytotoxicity, stability and biometric parameters, including \n\ntransepidermal water loss, hydration, strengthening the cutaneous barrier and elasticity, \n\namong others.  \n\nUnder normal physiological condition, skin has an acidic pH between 4.5 and 6.5 that \n\ndepends on the region. The acidic skin pH contributes to the defense against \n\nmicrobiological or chemical agents, the skin barrier homeostasis and stratum corneum \n\ndesquamation [72]. Therefore, since skin pH has several important biological functions \n\nand its change could compromise the functions of topical formulations, these should \n\npresent a pH value similar to skin pH.  \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\nRheology, the science that studies the behavior of materials when they are under the \n\ninfluence of external forces, is a fundamental parameter in the development of \n\nformulations, but also in its manufacturing and application, and to ensure long shelf-life. \n\nViscosity and elasticity are the simplest rheological properties [73]. Newtonian fluids are \n\nviscous but not elastic materials, like water, that under the smallest force, spend all energy \n\nin flowing; and Hookian bodies are elastic but not viscous materials, like rubber, that \n\nspends the force applied to change its shape and stores the energy. The semi-solid \n\nformulations have both viscosity and elasticity, being characterized by complex \n\nrheological properties, which depends on their internal structure [70].  \n\nDifferent rheological fluid behaviors are observed in topical formulations: shearthinning, \n\ndilatant fluids, thixotropic and rheopectic. A purely viscous fluid is said to be \n\nshearthinning and is characterized by a viscosity decrease along with a shear rate increase. \n\nIn dilatant fluids, the apparent viscosity increases with increasing shear rate. \n\nShearthinning and dilatant fluids are independent of time. At a constant shear rate, the \n\nshear stress decreases monotonically in the case of thixotropic fluids and the shear stress \n\nincreases monotonically in rheopectic fluids. These last types are time dependent fluids \n\n[74].  \n\nTopical formulations contain several ingredients, like oil, water and glycerin (source of \n\ncarbon), and substances, like amino acids derivatives and proteins (source of nitrogen), \n\nthat can encourage the growth of microorganism. Therefore, to assure its quality is \n\nnecessary to add preservatives, which are able to suppress the proliferation of \n\nmicroorganisms that may have contaminated it and to kill them, thereby preventing the \n\nproduct deterioration. To assure the near or total absence of microorganisms, two methods \n\nare largely used in microbiological control: total aerobic microbial count (TAMC) and \n\ntotal combined yeasts and molds count (TYMC) tests [70].  \n\nHuman repeated insult patch testes (HRIPT) is one of the most used methods to evaluate \n\nthe safety of finished cosmetics products, which is performed under exaggerated \n\nconditions of product exposure. This test requires a large group of subjects (100) and can \n\nbe performed in several different manners with distinct exposure times and occluding \n\nmethods. The subjects are exposed to the cosmetic products during a 3 weeks\u2019 period, \n\nwhich is followed by a 2 weeks\u2019 rest period. Afterwards, the challenge period is \n\nperformed using a 24 or 48 h patch test and the resulting reaction is categorized for clinical \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\nsigns. The product concentration used is determined by prior sensitization test results \n\nperformed in animals, results from repeated application irritation patch studies in humans \n\nand prior experience [75]. \n\nTo study the efficacy of cosmetic products are used non-invasive techniques, such as \n\nelasticity, skin thickness, wrinkling, roughness, transepidermal water loss, hydration, \n\nstrengthening the cutaneous barrier and elasticity, among others. These parameters can \n\nevaluate possible adverse reactions and changes that may occurred in the skin, hair or \n\nnails after the use of a cosmetic product.  \n\nA cosmetic to be considered safe according to regulation (EC) N\u00b0 1223/2009, shouldn\u2019t \n\nshow adverse effects on normal or sensitive individuals like skin irritation, sensitization, \n\nphototoxicity and photosensitization.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\n1.5.

Objectives \n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the antioxidant properties of artichoke extract in \n\ntopical formulations. \n\nFor this purpose, other tasks with a high interest were also proposed: \n\n? Increase the acknowledge of purification strategies of plant extracts that may be \n\nused posteriorly in other species studies and even in industrial processes; \n\n? Found new applications for this specie since it is highly produced and has an \n\nenormous economic value in the Mediterranean region.  \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\n3. Chapter: Materials and Methods \n \n\n3.1. Purification and Chemical Analysis  \n\n3.1.1. Preparation of Artichoke Extract  \n\nCynara Cardunculus Scolymus bracts from DIAT\u00c9TICA\u00ae were acquired and an infusion \n\nwith 91.02 g of it in 910.2 mL of boiled distilled water was performed for 10 minutes. \n\nThis process was followed by a vacuum filtration with a 70 MM filter in order to remove \n\nthe bracts from the aqueous part. \n\n3.1.2. Artichoke Extract Dialysis  \n\nA gastric juice solution was prepared through the addition of 320 mg of pepsin and 200 \n\nmg of NaCl to 100 mL of distilled water with a pH of 1.2, which was previously acidified \n\nwith HCl 37%, and was also prepared a 50 mg/mL artichoke solution. A dialysis mix was \n\nprepared with 50% of gastric juice and 50% of artichoke solution, and then put in a bath \n\nat 37\u00b0C for 60 minutes. Afterward, this mix was added to a dialysis membrane, which \n\nwas place inside of a goblet with 100 mL of acidified distilled water (pH 1.2) at room \n\ntemperature. The dialysis process lasted 24 hours. The outer waters were exchanged a \n\nfew times to prevent its saturation and were preserved in a recipient, and aliquots were \n\ncollected during the process to evaluate its efficacy. \n\n3.1.3. Mucilage Precipitation \n\nIn order to precipitate the mucilage present in the artichoke extract, two different \n\napproaches were adopted: a method found in literature using acetic acid [1] and the same \n\nmethod readapted without the use of acetic acid. 0.5 g of artichoke extract were dissolved \n\nin 25 mL of distilled water, and then this solution was added to 100 mL of A solution \n\n(96% ethanol and 1% 100% glacial acetic acid) or B solution (96% ethanol), according \n\nto the methodology chosen. A centrifugation at 2 600 g for 10 minutes was followed. The \n\nsupernatant was separated from the pellet and reserved in a recipient for posterior \n\nlyophilization. The pellet was dried in a nitrogen line. The initial mass wasn\u2019t always the \n\nsame, but the reagent proportions used were always equal. The assay with use of acetic \n\nacid resulted in artichoke fraction B and the assay with no use of acetic acid in artichoke \n\nfraction C. \n\n \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\n3.1.4. McCleary Method  \n\nThe McCleary method (AOAC 2009.01) was also performed with the purpose of \n\nprecipitate the mucilage. The artichoke fraction C obtained from the mucilage \n\nprecipitation method with no use of acetic acid, was the fraction chosen to perform this \n\nmethod.  \n\nInitially, 30 mg of artichoke fraction C were dissolved in 2 mL of distilled water with a \n\npH of 1.2 and then 2 mL of gastric juice were added, and then the mix was place in a \n\nwater bath for 60 minutes at 37\u00b0C. After the first digestion, the mix was placed in the \n\nrefrigerator for 60 minutes. A centrifugation at 2 600 g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C was \n\nfollowed, but it didn\u2019t form any pellet. Afterwards, another digestion was performed \n\nadding 2 mL of pancreatic juice to the mix again. The pH of this mixture was adjusted to \n\n6.0 through the addition of 1 M NaOH. The mix was placed again in the water bath at \n\n37\u00b0C for 60 minutes, and then reserved again in the refrigerator for 18 hours. A \n\ncentrifugation with the same conditions as before was realized, and the supernatant was \n\nseparated from the pellet for posterior lyophilization and the pellet was dried in an azote \n\nline.  \n\nThe gastric juice was prepared adding 320 mg of pure pepsin and 200 mg of NaCl to a \n\ntotal volume of 100 mL of distilled water previously acidified with 37% HCl to a pH of \n\n1.2. The pancreatic juice was prepared adding 250 mg of pancreatin from porcine \n\npancreas (8 \u00d7 USP specifications) to a 50 M sodium phosphate buffer solution pH 8, \n\nwhich was prepared using 5 mL of Na2HPO4 sodium phosphate buffer solution and 5 mL \n\nof NaHPO4 sodium phosphate buffer solution. \n\n3.1.4. Samples Drying \n\n3.1.4.1. Lyophilization  \n\nAll samples obtained throughout the study were lyophilized in order to prevent its \n\ndegradation. The samples were put in falcons or plastic recipients and then were \n\nlyophilized until its total dryness in a Heto PowerDry LL3000. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\n3.1.4.2. Solvent evaporation with rotary evaporator \n\nIn order to separate the fractions from undesirable compounds, a solvent evaporation with \n\nrotary evaporator was performed at 60\u00b0C in a B\u00fcchi Rotavapor R-200. The period of time \n\nvaried according with the time needed to evaporate all liquids present in the solution. \n\n3.1.5. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC -\n\nDAD)  \n\nHPLC-DAD analysis were performed in order to quantify the chlorogenic acid, \n\ncynaroside and cynarin and to observe the compounds present in the dry extracts. The \n\nHPLC-DAD analysis was performed in an Elite LaChrom\u00ae VWR Hitachi liquid \n\nchromatograph equipped with a column oven L-2300 and Diode array detector L-2455 \n\n(VWR, USA). The column LiChroCART\u00ae 250-4 LiChospher\u00ae 100 RP-8 (5 ?m) was \n\nused. \n\nThe method was already described [2]. It was used an injection volume of 25 ?L with an \n\nauto injector and a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The detection was carried out between 200 and \n\n500 nm with a diode array detector. A gradient composed by solutions A (0.05% \n\ntrifluoroacetic acid) and B (methanol) was used according as followed: 0 min, 80% A, \n\n20% B; 20 min 20% A, 80% B; 25 min, 20% A, 80% B. \n\nTo quantify the chlorogenic acid, cynaroside and cynarin in the extracts obtained during \n\nthe study, calibration curves were made using two different concentrations: 0.5 and 0.1 \n\nmg/mL for chlorogenic acid and cynarin; 0.25 and 0.1 mg/mL for cynaroside.  \n\n3.1.6. Total Phenolic Content with Folin -Ciocalteau Method \n\nThe content of phenolic compounds in the fractions studied was determined according to \n\nthe Folin-Ciocalteu procedure, using pure gallic acid as standard [3]. \n\nThe calibration standard curve was obtained using six different concentrations of gallic \n\nacid (10, 20, 50, 100, 350 and 500 ?g/ mL) and for blank was chosen the same solution \n\nwithout any gallic acid or sample. \n\nWas added 30 \u00b5L of sample, 1350 \u00b5L of distilled water and 30 \u00b5L of Folin-Ciocalteau \n\nreagent to an Eppendorf, and then it was subjected to vortex. Next, it rested for 3 minutes \n\nbefore adding 90 \u00b5L of sodium carbonate, and then it was set in continuous agitation in a \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\ncircular agitator at 18 rpm for 2 hours at 4\u00b0C. Finally, the absorbance was measured at \n\n760 nm in a Shimadzu UV-160A. \n\n3.1.7. Tannins Content with Prussian Blue  \n\nThe content of the tannins in the fractions obtained along the study was determined \n\naccording to the Prussian Blue procedure, using pure tannic acid as standard [4]. \n\nThe calibration standard curve was obtained using six different concentrations of tannic \n\nacid (10, 20, 40, 60, 100 and 150 ?g/ mL) and for blank was chosen the same solution \n\nwithout any tannic acid or sample. \n\nWere added 50 \u00b5L of sample, 150 \u00b5L of distilled water, 150 \u00b5L of 0.1 M ferric chloride \n\n(in 0.1 M of HCl) and 150 \u00b5L of 0.008 M potassium ferrocyanide to an Eppendorf and \n\nthe absorbance was measured at 605 nm in a Shimadzu UV-160A. \n\n3.1.8. Carbohydrates Content Measure \n\nThe content of carbohydrates in the fractions obtained along the study was determined \n\nwith the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) assay, using monohydrated glucose (dextrose) as \n\nstandard [5]. \n\nThe calibration standard curve was obtained using six different volumes of glucose 1.5 \n\nmg/mL (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6 mL) and for blank was chosen the same solution \n\nwithout any glucose or sample. \n\nWere added 5 mg of sample and 1 mL of 95-97% H2SO4 to a test tube, and then it was \n\nboiled for 20 minutes. Afterwards, was added to the same tube 1.2 mL of 1M NaOH. The \n\nmix obtained was subjected to a vacuum filtration with a 70 MM filter and then it was \n\nplaced in a 5 mL volumetric flask, which was make up to the mark with distilled water. 1 \n\nmL was collected from the previous solution and added to an Eppendorf, along with 1 \n\nmL of 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) and 2 mL of distilled water. This solution was \n\nboiled again for 5 minutes and then placed in a 25 mL volumetric flask, which was make \n\nup to the mark with distilled water. Finally, the absorbance was measured at 540 nm in a \n\nShimadzu UV-160A. \n\nTo prepare the DNS solution were added 0.5 g of DNS and 0.8 g of NaOH to 25 mL of \n\nheated distilled water and this process was performed in continuous magnetic agitation \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\nuntil total dissolution of the compounds added. Afterwards, the solution was left until \n\ntotal cooling and then were added 15 g of tartrate and 25 mL of distilled water. \n\n3.1.9. Protein Content with Bradfor d Method \n\nThe content of proteins in the fractions obtained along the study was determined \n\naccording to the Bradford method, using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard [6]. \n\nThe calibration standard curve was obtained using six different volumes of BSA (10, 20, \n\n40, 60, 80 and 100 ?L) and for blank was chosen the same solution without any BSA or \n\nsample. \n\nWere added 5 \u00b5L of sample, 795 \u00b5L of distilled water and 200 \u00b5L of Bradford reagent to \n\nan Eppendorf and the absorbance was measured at 595 nm in a Shimadzu UV-160A. \n\n3.1.10. Flavonoid Content \n\nThe content of flavonoids in the fractions obtained along the study was determined using \n\na spectrophotometric assay based on aluminium complex formation, using catechin as \n\nstandard [7]. \n\nThe calibration standard curve was obtained using six different concentrations of catechin \n\n(10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 ?g/mL) and for blank was chosen the same solution without \n\nany catechin or sample. \n\nWere added 20 \u00b5L of sample, 480 \u00b5L of distilled water and 300 \u00b5L of NaNO2 (5% w/v) \n\nto an Eppendorf and the solution was left at room temperature for 5 minutes. Afterwards, \n\nwere added 30 \u00b5L of AlCl3 (10% w/v) and another minute was waited before adding 200 \n\n\u00b5L of 1M NaOH. The absorbance was measured at 510nm in a Shimadzu UV-160A. \n\n3.1.11. Cytotoxicity and Effects on Membrane Integrity Assays  \n\nThe cytotoxicity was evaluated using general cell viability endpoint MTT reduction (3-\n\n(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl- 2H-tetrazolium bromide) and propidium iodide \n\nexclusion assays [8], [9]. The MTT is a yellow water-soluble tetrazolium dye that is \n\nreduced to an insoluble-water purple formazan product by living cells. This last product \n\nwhen solubilized in an appropriate solvent can be measured spectrophotometrically, \n\nallowing the indirect determination of surviving number cells when exposed to a sample \n\n[10]. \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\nCell viability was assessed after 24h of incubation of a spontaneously immortalized \n\nhuman keratinocyte cell line HaCaT (CLS, Germany) with different concentrations of \n\nextracts. This assay required three days. In the first day, HaCaT cells were seeded in \n\nsterile flat bottom 96 well tissue culture plates (Greiner, Germany), in RPMI 1640 culture \n\nmedium (Life Technologies, UK), supplemented with 10% Fetal serum bovine, 100 units \n\nof penicillin G (sodium salt) and 100 ?g of streptomycin sulfate and 2mM L-glutamine \n\n(Life Technologies, UK), at a cell density of 2x105 cells/mL 100 microliters per well. \n\nCells were incubated at 37\u00b0 C and 5% CO2. On the second day, the medium was replaced \n\nby fresh medium and the artichoke extract, the artichoke fraction C or their respective \n\nformulations were added to six wells per plate. Then, cells were incubated for 24 h, \n\nnegative control was the culture medium and positive control sodium dodecyl sulfate \n\n(SDS) at 1 mg/mL. In the third day, after the time of exposition, the medium was replaced \n\nby 0.3 mM propidium iodide in culture medium (stock solution 1.5 mM in DMSO, diluted \n\nwith culture medium 1:5). Fluorescence was measured (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 590 \n\nnm) in microplate reader (FLUOstar Omega, BMGLabtech, Germany), and then, the \n\nMTT assay was performed. Medium was replaced by medium containing 0.25 mg/mL \n\nMTT. The cells were incubated again for 3h. Afterwards, the medium was removed and \n\nthe intracellular formazan crystals were solubilized and extracted with 100 \u00b5l \n\ndimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). After 15 min in continuous agitation at room temperature \n\nthe absorbance was measured at 570 nm in FLUOstar Omega BMGLabtech Microplate \n\nReader. \n\nThe relative cell viability (%) compared to control cells was calculated for the MTT assay \n\nusing the following equation: \n\n% cell viability = \n??? ??????\n\n??? ???????\n\u00d7 100 \n\nWhere Abssample is the absorbance measured for cells treated with artichoke extract or \n\nartichoke fraction C formulations and Abscontrol is the absorbance value obtained for cells \n\nincubated with culture medium in the cases of extracts and the absorbance values obtained \n\nfor cells incubated with its blank in the cases of topical formulations, both measured at \n\n570 nm. \n\n \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\nAnd for propidium iodide assay by:  \n\n% cell viability = \n???????????? ??????\n\n???????????? ???????\n \n\nwhere Fluorescencesample is the relative fluorescence unit (URF) values obtained for cells \n\ntreated with desired samples and Fluorescencecontrol is the URF values obtained for cells \n\nincubated with culture medium in the case of extracts and URF values obtained for cells \n\nincubated with its blank in the case of topical formulations. \n\n3.1.12. Antioxidant Activity \n\n3.1.12.1. 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay  \n\nThe 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay was used for determination of free \n\nradical-scavenging activity of the fractions, and the standard utilized was ascorbic acid \n\n[11]. DPPH is a stable free radical characterized by an unpaired valence electron at one \n\natom of nitrogen bridge which bears a deep purple color, and when it\u2019s neutralized \n\nbecomes colorless or pale yellow. This method is based on measurement of the loss of \n\nDPPH color at 517 nm after reaction with samples [12]. \n\nThe calibration standard curve was obtained using four different concentrations of the \n\nfraction tested (5, 10, 15 and 20 mg/mL) and for blank was chosen the same solution \n\nwithout any sample. Was added 1 mL of DPPH solution and 10 \u00b5L of sample to an \n\nEppendorf and it was placed for 30 minutes at room temperature. Then the absorbance \n\nwas measured at 517 nm in a Shimadzu UV-160A. \n\nThe DPPH solution was prepared using 2 mg of pure DPPH and 100 mL of methanol. \n\nThe percentages of inhibition of the DPPH free radical were calculated through the \n\nfollowing equation:  \n\n% of inhibition = 100 ? (\n??\n\n??\n? 100) \n\nWhere Af is the absorbance measured for the fraction and Ab is the absorbance measured \n\nfor the blank. Were realized three independent experiments and the results obtained are \n\nexpressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. To calculate the half maximal effective \n\nconcentration (EC50), which is required to scavenge 50% of DPPH free radicals, two \n\napproaches were adopted depending on the antioxidant profile observed. A linear \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nregression was opted for all fractions, with exception of artichoke extract. For this \n\nfraction, the EC50 value was obtained directly from the profile % of inhibition-\n\nconcentration obtained. \n\n3.1.12.2. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Production \n\nMeasurement \n\nThe intracellular ROS production can be evaluated through a fluorimeter technique that \n\nuses 2,7\u2019 dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2-DCFDA, Life Technologies, UK). \n\nThis molecule non-fluorescent is hydrolyzed to 2-7\u2019-dichlorodihydrofluorescein \n\n(H2DCF), another non-fluorescent molecule, by the action of intracellular esterases. \n\nH2DCF is rapidly oxidized to a highly fluorescent compound (DCF) [13]\u2013[15] in the \n\npresence of H2O2, hydroxyl radicals and several peroxides [16].  \n\nIn this assay were used HaCaT sub-confluent cells grown in 96 well plates, which were \n\nincubated for 30 minutes with 20 ?M of H2-DCFDA in dark at 37\u00b0C. Later, the medium \n\nwas removed and fresh medium was added to the cells before being exposed to different \n\nconcentrations of extracts and ascorbic acid or topical formulations containing the \n\nextracts for 1 hour. In the case of the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), it was added \n\nsimultaneously with the samples in study. For the UV assay, three UV-B lamps (Sankyo \n\nDenki G8T5E, Kanagawa, Japan) with a peak emission at 312 nm were used as the UV-\n\nB source, and measured with a VLX 312 radiometer equipped with a UV-B sensor (Vilber \n\nLourmat, Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e Cedex, France). The cells with the extracts or the topical \n\nformulations were irradiated with a UV-B single dose of 26 mJ/cm2 for 15 minutes. \n\nAfterwards, the ROS levels were determined at excitation 485 nm and emission 520 nm \n\nwavelengths using a florescence microplate reader (FLUOstar BMGLabtech, Germany) \n\n[17]. Data collected from at least 5 replicates is expressed as percentage of reduction of \n\nROS. \n\n3.1.13. In vitro SPF determination \n\nAll natural fractions, including artichoke extract, artichoke fraction C and green coffee \n\noil, were accurately weighed (0.25 g), diluted with ethanol:water solution (1:1), followed \n\nby ultrasonication for 5 min and filtered through filter paper (WhatmanTM 42). The \n\nabsorption spectra of samples solution were obtained in the range of 290 to 320 nm \n\n(Hitachi U-2001, USA) every 5 nm, using a standard 1 cm quartz cell, and ethanol:water \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\nsolution as the blank reagent. Triplicates were made, followed by the application of the \n\nMansur equation: \n\n \n\nSPFspectrophotometric = CF x? ??\n320\n290  (?) x I (?) x Abs (?) \n\n \n\nwhere EE (?) is the erythemal effect spectrum; I (?) is the solar intensity spectrum; Abs \n\n(?) is the absorbance of sunscreen product and CF is the correction factor (=10) [18]. The \n\nvalues of EE x I are constants determined by Sayre [19]. \n\n \n\n3.2. Topical Formulations Development  \n\n3.2.1. Preparation of an emulsion and a hydrogel \n\nThe emulsion was prepared through the combination of different ingredients, being the \n\nfinal formulation recipe in Table 3.1. Parabens sodium salts changed the emulsions colors \n\nto pale green, instead of pale beige, so in order get more stable formulations, parabens \n\nwith no sodium were chosen. In total, three emulsions were prepared: blank cream (BC), \n\ncream containing artichoke extract (AC) and cream containing artichoke fraction C (CC). \n\nTable 3.1 - Percentage of ingredients in artichoke extract and artichoke fraction C emulsions. \n\nIngredients \nQuantitative \n\nComposition (%, w/w) \n\nPolyglyceryl-3 Dicitrate/Stearate (Tego Care PSC3\u00ae) 3 \n\nCetearyl Alcohol (Tego Alkanol 1618\u00ae) 7 \n\nLiquid Paraffin 2.5 \n\nDecyl Oleate (Tegosoft Do\u00ae) 4.5 \n\nAlmond Oil 5 \n\nGlycerin 5 \n\nPurified Water 71.8 \n\nMethylparaben (Nipagin\u00ae) 0.18 \n\nPropylparaben (Nipazol\u00ae) 0.02 \n\nDry Artichoke Extract/ Dry Artichoke Fraction C 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\nThe process to prepared the emulsion involved the following steps: \n\nI. Adding the oily compounds (polyglyceryl-3 dicitrate/stearate, cetearyl alcohol, \n\nliquid paraffin, decyl oleate and almond oil) to a bowl and the non-oily compounds \n\n(glycerin and 70% of the purified water) to another bowl and place both bowls in a \n\nwater bath at 70-80\u00b0C until total homogenization; \n\nII. Dissolving the extract in the remain purified water (around 30%) and reserve it; \n\nIII. Verting the oily ingredients to the bowl containing the non-oily ingredients; \n\nIV. Taking the mix to ultra-turrax during 2-3 minutes; \n\nV. Adding the parabens to the mix while it is still warm; \n\nVI. Stirring the mix until it\u2019s cold; \n\nVII. Adding the dissolved extract and then agitating the mix until it is homogeneous.  \n\n \n\nThe ingredients used to prepare the hydrogel are shown in Table 3.2. The polymer chosen \n\nto prepare the hydrogel was a carbomer, Carbopol 940\u00ae, which is a cross-linked \n\npolyacrylate polymer, that confers high viscosity, high suspending ability and high clarity \n\nto the formulation. The preservatives chosen were methyl and propyl parabens with no \n\nsodium. In total, three gels were prepared: blank gel (BG), gel containing artichoke \n\nextract (AG) and gel containing artichoke fraction C (CG). \n\nTable 3.2 - Percentage of ingredients in artichoke extract and artichoke fraction C hydrogels. \n\nIngredients \nQuantitative Composition \n\n(%, w/w) \n\nPurified Water 86.48 \n\nCarbomer (Carbopol 940\u00ae) 1.12 \n\nGlycerin 11.2 \n\nMethylparaben (Nipagin\u00ae) 0.18 \n\nPropylparaben (Nipazol\u00ae) 0.02 \n\nDry Artichoke Extract/ Dry Artichoke Fraction C 1 \n\n \n\nThe process to develop the hydrogel involved the following steps: \n\nI. Adding all ingredients to a bowl, except the dry extract and some of the purified water; \n\nII. Dissolving the extract in the remain purified water and reserve it; \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\nIII. Adding the dissolved extract to the bowl; \n\nIV. Leaving the mix for 30 minutes at room temperature; \n\nV. Taking the mix to ultra-turrax during 2-3 minutes; \n\nVI. Adding sodium hydroxide to the mix until it gained the desired consistency. \n\n \n\nA blank for each formulation were also prepared to be used as control standards in the \n\nassays using the emulsions and gels.  \n\n \n\n3.2.2. Formulations Rheology  \n\nAll formulations prepared, including their blanks, were analysed relatively to its \n\nconsistency. Therefore, its viscosity was measured with a rotational digital viscometer \n\nBrookfield DV II and small sample adapter (SSA) \u2013 Brookfield Engineering Laboratories, \n\nEUA. The viscosity of the two formulations prepared, emulsion and hydrogel, were very \n\ndistinct, so two spindles were used. For the emulsions was used the spindle n\u00ba 27 and for \n\nthe hydrogels the spindle n\u00ba 7. Approximately 25 mL of formulation were placed in the \n\nrecipient of the viscometer, and it was subdued to a continuous shear rate sweep (from \n\n0,6 to 122 s-1), keeping each shear rate for 15 seconds. \n\n3.2.3. pH Measurement \n\nThe pH of each formulation were measured with the pH meter InoLab 730 WTW, at room \n\ntemperature. At least three measures were performed for each emulsion and each gel, and \n\nthe data were collected after stabilization of value on the equipment. \n\n3.2.4. Microbiological Control \n\nThe microbiological stability assessment was performed according to the ISO \n\n16212:2008, ISO 21149:2006 and ISO 21148:2005 [20]\u2013[22]. \n\n \n\n3.3. In Vivo Studies Analysis  \n\n3.3.1. Human Repeat Insult Patch Testing (HRIPT)  \n\nMarzully and Maibach HRIPT protocol [23] was used to performed a safety evaluation. \n\nFor this study were chosen 50 healthy volunteers that were informed about the procedure \n\nand had signed the informed written consent. Volunteers with dermatological or other \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\nmedical or physical problems, and pregnant and nursing women were excluded from the \n\nstudy. The induction period of a possible allergic response lasted three weeks, in which a \n\nseries of 9 patches (Finn Chamber standard) were performed. Each occlusive patch \n\ncontained 20 mg of the formulation and was applied on the left side of the back. After 48 \n\nhours, the patch was removed and was performed a skin evaluation, which was followed \n\nby the application of a new patch. Reactions after patching were measured according to \n\nthe recommendations of the International Contact Dermatitis Research Group [24]. \n\nInduction period was followed by a two weeks\u2019 rest period, in which wasn\u2019t applied the \n\ntested product. Afterwards, challenge period started and new patches were applied again \n\nin the same way as in the induction period, but this time were applied in the right side of \n\nthe back. After a period of 48 hours the patches were removed and skin evaluations were \n\nrealized to observe possible skin reactions at 48, 72 and 96 hours after patching using \n\nagain the score method recommended by the International Contact Dermatitis Research \n\nGroup.  \n\nThis protocol was approved by the local Ethical Committee and respected the Helsinki \n\nDeclaration and the AFSSAPS regulations on performed HRIPT studies on cosmetic \n\nproducts. This study was supervised by a dermatologist who participated in the skin \n\nevaluations in order to observe possible irritation/allergic reactions to the tested \n\nformulations. \n\n \n\n3.3.2. Assessment of the protective ef fect against oxidative stress \n\nafter UV radiation by chromameter evaluation  \n\nIn the first day, three patches were applied in the forearm area (left or right) in each \n\nvolunteer, two contained the formulations and the other one was the control, in which no \n\nproduct was applied. The patches remained 24 hours, and after this period, a solution of \n\n?-carotene was applied in the same area of the forearm. A negative control area with only \n\n?-carotene was also used. After 15 min of ?-carotene application, the color was measured \n\nin all the areas. The areas were then irradiated with a UVA lamp and the color was \n\nmeasured again. A Minolta Chromameter CR-400 (Minolta, Japan) was used to obtain \n\nthe b* color. The same area was evaluated at the first day (D0) and then after 28 days \n\n(D28) using the same procedure. Between D0 and D28, the volunteers applied the topical \n\nproducts in the areas indicated by the principal investigator. \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\n \n\n3.4. Statistical Analysis  \n\nData was expressed as mean and standard deviation (mean \u00b1 SD) of experiments. \n\nStatistical evaluation of data was performed using one-way analysis of variance \n\n(ANOVA). Tukey\u2013Kramer multiple comparison test (GraphPad PRISM 7\u00ae software, \n\nUSA), was used to compare the significance of the difference between the groups, a P \n\n<0.05 was accepted as significant. \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\n3.5.

Purification of Artichoke Extract  \n\nIn order to purify the artichoke extract and to improve its properties, including antioxidant \n\nactivity, two different purification approaches were addopted: an acidic digestion with \n\ngastric juice followed by a 24 hours dialysis, and a mucilage precipitation method. In this \n\nlast one, the importance of acetic acid in the procedure was also investigated. The \n\npurification schematics is presented in Figure 4.2.  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n-20000\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nA\nve\n\nra\ng\n\ne\n A\n\nb\nso\n\nrb\na\n\nn\nce\n\n (\nm\n\nU\nA\n\n)\n\nTime (minutes)\n\nFigure 4.1 - Example of chromatogram of artichoke infusion (1mg/mL). \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2.1. Acidic Digestion &amp; Dialysis (Artichoke Fraction A)  \n\nTea infusions when ingested are exposed to gastric juice, and consequently to a complex \n\nsystem of enzymes and to a highly acidic pH (1.0-2.5) [1]. Pepsin is one of those enzymes \n\nand its optimum pH range is 1.5-2.5, which means that it has its maximum activity inside \n\nthe stomach [2]. It can cleave the linkages between mucilage and phenolic compounds, \n\nenhancing the extraction of polyphenols from the artichoke extract during dialysis. \n\nTherefore, in order to maximize the extraction of polyphenols compounds from the \n\nartichoke extract, a dialysis with a previous acidic digestion of artichoke extract was \n\nmade.  \n\nTo follow the progress of dialysis, aliquots of the permeate were collected along the assay. \n\nThe permeate \u2013 the outer water where the retentate is placed - was exchanged three times \n\nto avoid saturation (3, 6 and 22 hour), which would probably slow down the polyphenols \n\nextraction. Over time was observed a change of coloration in the permeate, being the \n\nearlier samples colorless and the latest pale brown. This indicated that probably there was \n\noccurring an extraction from the artichoke extract to the permeate. This purified fraction \n\nwill be called Artichoke Fraction A. \n\nPhenolic compounds present in each aliquot were measured through a well-established \n\nmethod of polyphenols quantification. It\u2019s important to mention that the outer waters were \n\nexchanged after the hour 3, 6 and 22, so the values present in  \n\nFigure 4.2 - Scheme of the purification strategies adopted to purify the artichoke extract.  \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\nTable 4.1 were not cumulative in the water. The maximum polyphenols mass was \n\nextracted after three hours of dialysis, meaning that a considerable quantity of \n\npolyphenols present in the artichoke extract were transferred from inside the dialysis \n\nmembrane to the permeate in the first hours. In the following hours of dialysis, the rate \n\nof extraction decreased substantially, for example the mass of polyphenols extracted in \n\n16 hours \u2013 between the collection of the samples of hours 6 and 22 \u2013 was only 72 \u00b5g ( \n\nTable 4.1; Figure 4.3). The total polyphenols extracted during this process was the sum \n\nof all polyphenols present in the outer waters collected along the process (hours 3, 6, 22 \n\nand 24). \n\n \n\nTable 4.1 - Quantification of polyphenols in artichoke fraction A after 3, 6, 22 and 24 hours of dialysis. \n\nTime (hour) Quantification of polyphenols (\u00b5g) \n\n3 295 \n\n6 100 \n\n22 72 \n\n24 3 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3 - Quantification of polyphenols in each aliquot collected from the artichoke fraction A during the 24 hours \n\nof dialysis. \n\n0\n\n0,5\n\n1\n\n1,5\n\n2\n\n2,5\n\n3\n\n3,5\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n\nP\no\n\nly\np\n\nh\ne\n\nn\no\n\nls\n (\n\n\u00b5\ng\n\n/m\nL)\n\nTime (hours)\n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\nThe HPLC-DAD chromatograms of the artichoke extract and the retentate \u2013 part of the \n\nextract that does not pass through the dialysis membrane \u2013 showed the presence of the \n\nsame compounds in both fractions, since there are traces of every compound present in \n\nthe artichoke extract in the retentate chromatogram (Figure 4.4). The same occurred in \n\nthe HPLC-DAD chromatograms of the retentate and the artichoke fraction A (Figure 4.5).  \n\nFigure 4.4 - Yield of compounds identified for artichoke extract and retentate obtained after dialysis by HPLC-DAD. \n\n  \n\nFigure 4.5 - Yield of compounds indentified for retentate and artichoke fraction A, both obtained after dialysis, by \n\nHPLC-DAD. \n\n-20000\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\n100000\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nA\nve\n\nra\ng\n\ne\n A\n\nb\nso\n\nrb\na\n\nn\nce\n\n (\nm\n\nU\nA\n\n)\n\nTime (minutes)\n\nRetentate Artichoke Fraction A\n\n-20000\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\n100000\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nArtichoke Extract Retentate\n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\nA control sample constituted by 50% water and 50% gastric juice was analyzed by HPLC-\n\nDAD in order to compare with the rest of the chromatograms obtained from dialysis \n\nsamples. In Figure 4.6, the retentate and digested artichoke extract (artichoke extract after \n\nthe acidic digestion with gastric juice) chromatograms showed a peak at minute 25.2 that \n\ndidn\u2019t exist in the artichoke extract spectrum. However, this peak was also present in the \n\ncontrol chromatogram, which suggests that it corresponds to the pepsin enzyme. This \n\nimplies that the enzyme is not transferred from the retentate to the artichoke fraction A \n\nthrough the dialysis membrane, which complies with pepsin molecular weight (? 36 000 \n\nDa) and the molecular weight cutoff of the membrane pores (10 000 Da). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.6 - Yields of compounds identified for the control sample, the retentate, the artichoke fraction A, the artichoke \n\nextract and the digested artichoke extract by HPLC-DAD.

Mucilage Precipitation (Art ichoke Fractions B and C)  \n\nPrevious studies demonstrated the potential of polyphenolic-polysaccharide \n\nglycoconjugates isolated from medicinal plants of Asteraceae family as antioxidants, \n\nonce they exhibited the capacity to protect proteins and lipids present in human plasma \n\nagainst oxidative stress caused by ?-radiation [3]. However, Kim et al. [4] showed that \n\nmucilage removal through an enzymatic hydrolysis from cactus cladodes resulted in an \n\nincrease of phenolic compounds in the extract, and consequently in the improvement of \n\nits radical scavenging activity. Therefore, in order to remove the mucilage present in the \n\n0\n\n100000\n\n200000\n\n300000\n\n400000\n\n500000\n\n600000\n\n-20000\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\n100000\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nA\nve\n\nra\ng\n\ne\n A\n\nb\nso\n\nrb\na\n\nn\nce\n\n (\nm\n\nU\nA\n\n)\n\nTime (minutes)\n\nControl Retentate Artichoke Fraction A\n\nArtichoke Extract Digested Artichoke Extract\n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\nartichoke extract, a method found in literature was used [5]. This method had as purpose \n\nthe improvement of the phenolic content of artichoke extract and consequently, its \n\nantioxidant activity. \n\nInitially, it was tested whether the presence of acetic acid affected the mucilage \n\nprecipitation of the artichoke extract, in terms of phenolic compounds and antioxidant \n\nactivity. Both assays were realized, one using acetic acid and the other without acetic \n\nacid, remaining the rest of the procedure equal. The supernatant obtained from the method \n\nusing acetic acid will be called Artichoke Fraction B and the supernatant from the method \n\nwithout acetic acid will be named Artichoke Fraction C.  \n\n \n\n4.3. Extracts Chemical Analysis  \n\n4.3.1. Artichoke Extract \n\n4.3.1.1. HPLC-DAD Analysis \n\nPrevious studies showed the presence of chlorogenic acid (5-caffeoylquinic acid), cynarin \n\n(1,3-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid) and cynaroside (luteolin-7-O-glucoside) in the artichoke \n\nextract [6]. Therefore, in order to investigate the presence of these compounds in the \n\nartichoke infusion previously prepared, a HPLC-DAD analysis was performed, being the \n\nchromatogram obtained in Figure 4.7.  \n\nThe retention times of chlorogenic acid, cynarin and cynaroside were approximately 7.38, \n\n12.4 and 12.65 min, respectively. So, the peak 1 indicated in Figure 4.7 corresponds to \n\nchlorogenic acid, the peak 2 to cynarin and the peak 3 to cynaroside.  \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.7 \u2013 Example of chromatogram of artichoke infusion (1mg/mL). \n\n \n\nTo measure these antioxidants in the artichoke infusion were performed several HPLC-\n\nDAD analyses of chlorogenic acid, cynarin and cynaroside with well-known \n\nconcentrations to create HPLC-DAD calibration curves, being the results in Table 4.2. \n\nCynarin showed to be the most abundant antioxidant in the artichoke extract with \n\naproximally 83 ?g/ mg of artichoke extract, and chlorogenic acid revealed to be also in \n\nhigh levels with aproximally 56 ?g/ mg of artichoke extract. This outcome is in accord \n\nwith the literature, where chlorogenic acid and cynarin are showed to be the mainly \n\ncompounds of Cynara C. Scolymus [7]. The flavone cynaroside is present in a smaller \n\namount when compared with the two caffeoylquinic acids, with only 7 ?g/mg of artichoke \n\nextract. Therefore, artichoke extract showed to be rich in phenolic compounds and \n\nflavones, which can explain its antioxidant activity. \n\n \n\nTable 4.2 \u2013 Total content of chlorogenic acid, cynaroside and cynarin in the artichoke extract. \n\n Total Content (?g/mg of artichoke extract) \n\nChlorogenic Acid 56 \n\nCynaroside 7 \n\nCynarin 83 \n\n \n\n-20000\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nA\nve\n\nra\ng\n\ne\n A\n\nb\nso\n\nrb\na\n\nn\nce\n\n (\nm\n\nU\nA\n\n)\n\nTime (minutes)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\n4.3.1.2. McCleary Method  \n\nIn the mucilage precipitation method was observed a smaller amount of precipitate than \n\nit was expected, so was also realized the McCleary method. This method consists in two \n\nsuccessive enzymatic digestions, the first with gastric juice and the second with pancreatic \n\njuice, and it was used to quantify the total dietary fibers present in the artichoke extract \n\nin order to characterize it. The artichoke fraction C was used in the beginning of this \n\nmethod. Its schematic is represented in Figure 4.8.  \n\nFigure 4.8 - Scheme of the McCleary method. \n\n \n\nIn order to follow the process, aliquots of the supernatants and precipitate formed were \n\ncollected and posteriorly analyzed by HPLC-DAD. The chromatograms of the artichoke \n\nfraction C and the supernatants obtain during this method are represented in Figure 4.9, \n\nand some differences are spotted between them, like the peaks intensities as well as the \n\nappearing of new peaks and the disappearing of old ones. These results suggest that during \n\nthe process, and due to the digestions by gastric and pancreatic juices, there are alterations \n\nin the artichoke extract, which are expected to lead to a more purified extract.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\n \n\nIn the gastric juice digestion realized in the first purification method, dialysis, was \n\nobserved the formation of a thin brown layer inside the dialysis membrane containing the \n\nartichoke extract, just like the layer observed also in the previous mucilage precipitation \n\nmethod, which means that the digestion of the extract using gastric juice results in the \n\nprecipitation of mucilage. However, in this method, after the gastric juice digestion, \n\nwasn\u2019t observed any layer and consequently, wasn\u2019t formed any precipitate. This could \n\nbe due to the previous mucilage precipitation method that resulted in the artichoke \n\nfraction C, which perhaps precipitated the all mucilage susceptible to the gastric juice \n\nenzymes. A closer look in the chromatograms of the artichoke fraction C and the \n\nsupernatant SA, represented in Figure 4.10, shows that there are no significant differences \n\nbetween them, with exception of the peaks intensities. Therefore, this digestion didn\u2019t \n\naffect the composition of the artichoke extract but according with the results showed in \n\nTable 4.3, there was an increase in the total content of phenolic compounds in the SA \n\nsupernatant when compared with the content of the artichoke fraction C. \n\n \n\n \n\n-200000\n\n0\n\n200000\n\n400000\n\n600000\n\n800000\n\n1000000\n\n1200000\n\n1400000\n\n1600000\n\n1800000\n\n0\n\n50000\n\n100000\n\n150000\n\n200000\n\n250000\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nA\nve\n\nra\ng\n\ne\n A\n\nb\nso\n\nrb\na\n\nn\nce\n\n (\nm\n\nU\nA\n\n)\n\nTime (minutes)\n\nSupernatant SA Supernatant SB Artichoke Fraction C\n\nFigure 4.9 -  HPLC-DAD analysis of the artichoke fraction C (15 mg/ mL), and the supernatants SA (1,5 mg/ mL) and \n\nSB (1,3 mg/ mL).

These alterations are probably due \n\nto the pancreatic digestion, which results in the alteration of the artichoke extract \n\ncomposition. Bouayed et al. [8] studied the influence of intestinal digestion, which \n\nincludes pancreatic juice, in the polyphenols of selected apple varieties. Changes in the \n\npolyphenolic profiles during intestinal digestion were observed and a considerable loss \n\nof polyphenols occurred. Another study reported the change of polyphenols after \n\npancreatic digestion, which was traduced by the decrease of anthocyanins, flavonols, \n\nflavan-3-ols and neochlorogenic acid, and the increase of chlorogenic acid [9]. However, \n\nin this study was observed a slightly increase of total phenols after gastric and pancreatic \n\ndigestion, being the results in Table 4.3. \n\n  Phenols (?g/ mg artichoke extract) \n\nArtichoke Fraction C 25 \u00b1 0.78 \n\nSA supernatant 30 \u00b1 1.98 \n\nSB supernatant 31 \u00b1 3.68 \n\n0\n\n200000\n\n400000\n\n600000\n\n800000\n\n1000000\n\n1200000\n\n1400000\n\n1600000\n\n1800000\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nA\nve\n\nra\ng\n\ne\n A\n\nb\nso\n\nrb\na\n\nn\nce\n\n (\nm\n\nU\nA\n\n)\n\nTime (minutes)\n\nArtichoke Fraction C Supernatant SA\n\nFigure 4.10 - HPLC-DAD analysis of the artichoke fraction C (15 mg/ mL) and the supernatant SA (1,5 mg/ mL). \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe HPLC-DAD analysis of the SB supernatant, the precipitate formed and the pancreatic \n\njuice, which chromatograms are presented in Figure 4.12 and Figure 4.13, suggests that \n\na fraction of the pancreatic juice remained in the supernatant and another fraction \n\nprecipitated with the mucilage. The peak 1 market in Figure 4.12, already marked before \n\nin the Figure 4.11, appears in the SB supernatant and in the pancreatic juice, but not in \n\nthe SA supernatant, which indicates that this peak corresponds to a compound of the \n\npancreatic juice, meaning that a part of it remained in the supernatant. On the other hand, \n\nthe peaks 1 and 2 market in Figure 4.13 represent the compounds present either in the \n\nprecipitate or in the pancreatic juice, indicating that a fraction of the pancreatic juice \n\nprecipitates along with the mucilage. The precipitation of pancreatic juice compounds can \n\npossible be explained by the interactions between proteins and polysaccharides through \n\nan electrostatic complex or micellar structures formation [10], which perhaps are \n\nresponsible for dragging the enzymes present in the solution, like pepsin and pancreatin, \n\nalong with the polysaccharides.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.11 - HPLC-DAD analysis of the SA (1,5 mg/ mL) and SB (1,3 mg/ mL) supernatants. \n\n0\n\n50000\n\n100000\n\n150000\n\n200000\n\n250000\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nA\nve\n\nra\ng\n\ne\n A\n\nb\nso\n\nrb\na\n\nn\nce\n\n (\nm\n\nU\nA\n\n)\n\nTime (minutes)\n\nSupernatant SA Supernatant SB\n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe precipitate formed in the last step of this method had a total mass of 18.2 mg.

Global composition \n\nThe artichoke is a higher plant, which means that its cells walls are made up of \n\naproximally 90% carbohydrates and 10% proteins, and it has in its constitution phenolic \n\ncompounds and dietary fibers as well [11], [12]. Therefore, carbohydrates, proteins, \n\npolyphenols and soluble and insoluble fibers were measure in the artichoke extract to \n\nproceed to its characterization, being the results in Table 4.4. A total of 66.7% of the \n\nartichoke extract was characterized, being the soluble and insoluble fibers the most \n\nabundant compound of the Cynara C. var. Scolymus infusion, corresponding to 62.8% of \n\nit. The content of proteins showed to be the lowest, only 0.002%, which can be a result \n\nof the thermal process involved in the preparation of the artichoke infusion. Other studies, \n\nalso reported a decrease of protein levels in vegetables after being boiled [13]. The levels \n\nof carbohydrates and phenolic compounds correspond to 0.82% and 3.06% of the \n\nartichoke extract, respectively.  \n\nTable 4.4 - Quantity of carbohydrates, proteins, phenols and soluble and insoluble fibers present in a total of 80 mg of \n\nartichoke extract.

On the other side, in this study the Cynara \n\nCardunculus Scolymus, specie also from the Asteraceae family, showed 306 mg per 100g \n\nof extract, being a richer source of polyphenols.  \n\n \n\n4.3.2. Artichoke Fraction A \n\nTo evaluate the efficiency of polyphenols extraction from artichoke extract to the \n\nArtichoke Fraction A, samples of retentate and artichoke fraction A were collected before \n\nand after dialysis in order to perform a few quantifications. \n\nAnalysis of the total phenols and tannins in all fractions showed that dialysis managed to \n\nextract phenols and tannins from the inside of tubing dialysis to the artichoke fraction A, \n\nbeing the results in Table 4.5.  \n\nTable 4.5 - Concentration of total phenols and tannins in artichoke extract, digested artichoke extract before dialysis \n\nand in the retentate and artichoke fraction A after dialysis.

However, in this study was observed a \n\ndecrease of polyphenols concentration present in the artichoke extract from 31 \u00b1 1.0 to \n\n16 \u00b1 5 \u00b5g/mg of artichoke extract after the gastric digestion. Bouayed et al. [8] also \n\nreported a decrease of polyphenols in four apple varieties after gastric digestion when \n\ncompared with their original content. Polyphenols and proteins, including enzymes like \n\npepsin, can be bonded through reversible or irreversible non-covalent interactions, such \n\nas hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic and ionic interactions [15]. Therefore, the decrease \n\nobserved may be due to these interactions.  \n\nAfterwards, in the dialysis process was observed a decrease of polyphenols and tannins \n\nconcentration in the retentate compared to the initial levels in the digested artichoke \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\nextract (from 16 \u00b1 5 to 3 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b5g/mg of artichoke extract in total phenols; from 0.02 \u00b1 \n\n0.001 to 0.002 \u00b1 0.0003 \u00b5g/mg of artichoke extract in tannins), and the opposite occurred \n\nin the artichoke fraction A, which levels increased (from 0 to 35 \u00b1 10 \u00b5g/mg of artichoke \n\nextract in total phenols and to 0.03 \u00b5g/mg of artichoke extract in tannins). Notice that the \n\nlevels of phenols and tannins are higher in artichoke fraction A than in the digested \n\nartichoke extract, suggesting that the interaction between polyphenols and proteins, such \n\nas pepsin, was reversible. The same happened between artichoke fraction A and artichoke \n\nextract, which suggests that a purification occurred, increasing polyphenols values per \n\nmg of artichoke extract. \n\nA quantification of chlorogenic acid, cynaroside and cynarin in the artichoke extract, \n\ndigested artichoke extract, retentate and artichoke fraction A was also performed. These \n\nresults are shown in Table 4.6. After acidic digestion, a decrease of chlorogenic acid and \n\ncynarin in the artichoke extract occurred, from 56 to 48 \u00b5g/mg of extract and from 83 to \n\n40 \u00b5g/mg of extract, respectively. On the other hand, an increase of cynaroside \n\nconcentration was observed, from 7 to 33 \u00b5g/mg of extract. After dialysis, was observed \n\na decrease of all components between the digested artichoke extract and the retentate, \n\nfrom 48 to 15 \u00b5g/mg of extract in chlorogenic acid, 33 to 3 \u00b5g/mg of extract in cynaroside \n\nand 40 to 28 \u00b5g/mg of extract in cynarin, which suggested that the transferring of these \n\ncompounds occurred to the artichoke fraction A. This can be confirmed through the \n\ncomparison of their values between the retentate and the artichoke fraction A, once \n\noccurred an increase of all in artichoke fraction A. \n\nTable 4.6 - Concentration of chlorogenic acid, cynarin and luteolin in digested artichoke extract before dialysis and in \n\nthe retentate and artichoke fraction A after dialysis. \n\n \n\nConsidering all results obtained, presented in Table 4.5 and Table 4.6, it is possible to \n\nconclude that this method was able to extract polyphenols, including chlorogenic acid, \n\ncynarin and cynaroside, from the artichoke infusion, which resulted in a purified fraction \n\n(artichoke fraction A). \n\n Concentration (\u00b5g/mg of extract) \n\n Artichoke \n\nExtract \n\nDigested \n\nartichoke extract \n\nRetentate Artichoke \n\nFraction A \n\nChlorogenic Acid 56 48 15 42 \n\nCynaroside  7 33 3 7 \n\nCynarin 83 40 28 71 \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\nThe artichoke fraction A was lyophilized and a total mass of 572.8 mg was recuperated, \n\nbut according to calculations, only 1.32 mg of polyphenols and tannins were extracted to \n\nthis fraction. Therefore, the dialysis tubing allowed other artichoke compounds to pass to \n\nthe permeate besides the polyphenols. These may be polysaccharides, so a mucilage \n\nquantification was performed and the results demonstrate that 22% of the lyophilized \n\nartichoke fraction A was mucilage. The same analysis was made for the lyophilized \n\nretentate and it showed that 33% were mucilage. The existence of mucilage inside and \n\noutside of the tubing dialysis probably happens due to size variances of the \n\npolysaccharides, being the molecular weight cutoff of 10 000 Da, meaning that only the \n\nmolecules with a smaller size than 10 000 Da can pass through the pores to the artichoke \n\nfraction A. \n\nInitially were added 550 mg of artichoke extract, 35 mg of pepsin and 22 mg of sodium \n\nchloride, these last ones were part of gastric juice, to the dialysis membrane, resulting in \n\na total mass of 607 mg. However, 43.6 mg of retentate and 572.8 mg of artichoke fraction \n\nA were recuperated after lyophilization, which equals 616 mg. Comparison of the initial \n\nmass with the recuperated showed a discrepancy of 9 mg. Lyophilization results in the \n\nabsorption of 5-10% (w/w) of water by the dried mixture, so this difference observed \n\nmaybe was due to its water content that wasn\u2019t lyophilized [16].  \n\n \n\n4.3.3. Artichoke Fraction B and C \n\nAs showed in Figure 4.14, the chromatograms of both supernatants, are very similar, \n\nbeing only notable a slight difference within the peaks intensities. The same happened \n\nwith the precipitates chromatograms as it is possible to observe in Figure 4.15. Therefore, \n\nthe absence of acetic acid in the method used to precipitate the mucilage present in the \n\nartichoke extract doesn\u2019t affect the composition of the supernatant and the precipitate. \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.14 - HPLC-DAD analysis of the artichoke fractions B and C. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.15 - HPLC-DAD analysis of the precipitates obtained from both methods, with and without acetic acid. \n\n \n\nAn analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the levels of phenols and tannins present \n\nin the precipitates and supernatants obtained from both assays didn\u2019t showed either \n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\n100000\n\n120000\n\n140000\n\n160000\n\n180000\n\n200000\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nA\nve\n\nra\ng\n\ne\n A\n\nb\nso\n\nrb\na\n\nn\nce\n\n (\nm\n\nU\nA\n\n)\n\nTime (minutes)\n\nArtichoke Fraction C Artichoke Fraction B\n\n0\n\n5000\n\n10000\n\n15000\n\n20000\n\n25000\n\n30000\n\n35000\n\n40000\n\n45000\n\n50000\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nA\nve\n\nra\ng\n\ne\n A\n\nb\nso\n\nrb\na\n\nn\nce\n\n (\nm\n\nU\nA\n\n)\n\nTime (minutes)\n\nAssay without acetic acid Assay with acetic acid\n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\nsignificant differences (p-value > 0.05) (Table 4.7), which means that the acetic acid \n\ndoesn\u2019t prevent the precipitation of these compounds along with the polysaccharides and \n\nproteins present in the mucilage. \n\nTable 4.7 - Quantification of total phenols and tannins in the supernatants and precipitates obtained with the mucilage \n\nprecipitation methods with and without acetic acid.

However, the \n\nresults obtained from both chromatograms, from total phenols and tannins quantification \n\nand from the quantification of selected polyphenols, showed no differences between \n\nartichoke fractions B and C obtained from both mucilage precipitation methods, with and \n\nwithout acetic acid. Considering these results and taking into account the purpose of these \n\ncompounds and their costs of production, the artichoke fraction C was the fraction that \n\nappeared to have more potential. Therefore, this fraction was studied more deeply.  \n\nIn order to analyze the separation of the artichoke compounds by the mucilage \n\nprecipitation method with no use of acetic acid, an analysis of the artichoke fraction C \n\nand the precipitate obtained from this procedure was performed by HPLC-DAD. In the \n\nchromatograms of Figure 4.16, the differences between the supernatant and the \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \n\nprecipitate obtained from this purification process are observed. Through a meticulous \n\nanalysis, it\u2019s possible to spot the same peaks in both chromatograms, which means that \n\nartichoke extract compounds were dragged along with the mucilage, resulting in their \n\nprecipitation too. \n\n \n\nIn Table 4.9 is shown the quantification of chlorogenic acid, cynarin and cynaroside in \n\nthe artichoke fraction C and its precipitate. Artichoke fraction C retained most of the \n\nselected polyphenols during the mucilage precipitation (68 \u00b5g/mg of extract of \n\nchlorogenic acid; 83 \u00b5g/mg of extract of cynarin; and 18 \u00b5g/mg of extract of cynaroside), \n\nwhile its precipitate dragged along a small fraction of those polyphenols during \n\nprecipitation (9 \u00b5g/mg of extract of chlorogenic acid; 16 \u00b5g/mg of extract of cynarin; and \n\n0.7 \u00b5g/mg of extract of cynaroside). The polyphenols precipitation may be due to the \n\ninteractions between polyphenols and polysaccharides, which bond them forcing the \n\npolyphenols to precipitate along with the polysaccharides [17]. \n\nTable 4.9 - Quantification of chlorogenic acid, cynarin and cynaroside in the artichoke fraction C and its precipitate. \n\n Concentration (\u00b5g/mg of extract) \n\n Artichoke Fraction C  Precipitate \n\nChlorogenic acid 68 9 \n\nCynarin 83 16 \n\nCynaroside 18 0.7 \n\n \n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\n100000\n\n120000\n\n140000\n\n160000\n\n180000\n\n200000\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nA\nve\n\nra\ng\n\ne\n A\n\nb\nso\n\nrb\na\n\nn\nce\n\n (\nm\n\nU\nA\n\n)\n\nTime (minutes)\n\nArtichoke Fraction C Precipitate\n\nFigure 4.16 - Analysis of the artichoke fraction C and its precipitate by HPLC-DAD (1 mg/mL both). \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n\nThe boiling point of ethanol is 78\u00baC [18], which is lower than the water boiling point \n\n(100\u00baC), so a strategy to eliminate the ethanol present in the supernatant through a \n\nwashing process by a rotary evaporator was adopted, and a HPLC-DAD analysis of \n\nwashed and unwashed artichoke fractions C was made to assure that this process wouldn\u2019t \n\nchange their composition, being the results in Figure 4.17. The chromatograms of both \n\nfractions are identical, having only different peaks intensities. Thus, the washing process \n\ndidn\u2019t affect the compounds present in the supernatants, being safe to use. \n\nFigure 4.17 - HPLC-DAD analysis of the artichoke fraction C washed and unwashed. \n\n \n\nA quantification of the total phenols present in the artichoke fraction C before and after \n\nthis process was also done.

Antioxidant Activities:  DPPH Assays \n\n4.4.1. Artichoke Extract \n\nThe effect of the artichoke extract in terms of the DPPH radical scavenging activity is \n\nrepresented in Figure 4.18. During the assay, the colors alterations between samples with \n\ndifferent artichoke infusion concentrations were visible, implying the existence of \n\nantioxidant activity.

The antioxidant activity of \n\nartichoke extract obtained through DPPH method, expressed as the half maximal effective \n\nconcentration (EC50), was 99 \u00b1 29 \u00b5g/mL. Fal\u00e9 et al.

After dialysis, was observed a decrease of chlorogenic \n\nacid and cynarin after acidic digestion and dialysis, from 56 to 42 \u00b5g/mg of extract and \n\nfrom 83 to 71 \u00b5g/mg of extract respectively, while cynaroside concentration was \n\nmaintained (7 \u00b5g/mg of extract). After mucilage precipitation, almost all compounds \n\nsuffered an increase in the artichoke fractions B and C comparing with their original \n\ncontent in artichoke extract (from 56 to 63 and 68 \u00b5g/mg of extract in chlorogenic acid; \n\nfrom 83 to 82 and 83 \u00b5g/mg of extract in cynarin; and from 7 to 14 and 18 \u00b5g/mg in \n\nextract of cynaroside). In the three cases, the antioxidant activity improved from 99 \n\n\u00b5g/mL (artichoke extract) to 95 \u00b5g/mL in the artichoke fraction A resulted from dialysis, \n\nand to 67 and 56 \u00b5g/mL in the artichoke fractions B and C, respectively, obtained from \n\nthe mucilage precipitation method.  \n\nObserving the results of  Table 4.12, the mucilage precipitation method with no use of \n\nacetic acid appears to be more effective in improving the artichoke extract antioxidant \n\nactivity. It was able to increase the antioxidant capacity over 40%. Therefore, the \n\nartichoke fraction C was the purified fraction chosen to continue the study and to be \n\nincorporated in the topical formulations.  \n\n \n\n4.6. Extracts Cytotoxicity \n\nCell-based assays are used to determine if a compound has effect on cell proliferation or \n\ndirect effects that lead to cell death. In order to study the artichoke extract and the \n\nartichoke fraction C cytotoxicity, the MTT assay was performed using HaCaT cells, a \n\nspontaneously immortalize human keratinocyte cell line. In the MTT assay, the viable \n\ncells with active metabolism are capable of converting the MTT into a purple compound, \n\nthe formazan, while the dead cells are incapable of converting it, which allows the \n\nquantification of viable cells [19]. The results of this assay are shown in Figure 4.24. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.24 - Cytotoxicity of artichoke extract (black bar) and artichoke fraction C (square bar) (1 mg/mL). SDS \n\n(sodium dodecyl sulfate) (dots bar)) was used as positive control and the medium as negative control (horizontal risks \n\nbar). The data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD of 6 replicates experiments. \n\n \n\nArtichoke extract and artichoke fraction C showed a cell viability of 18.3% and 21.3% \n\nrespectively, while SDS showed 4.6% and the medium 100%. Both fractions showed \n\ncytotoxicity and significant differences (p-value &lt;0.05) according to an analysis of \n\nvariance (ANOVA), when compared with the medium (negative control) and the SDS \n\n(positive control). However, the HaCaT cell lines are more sensible than actually skin, \n\nsince skin has a functional barrier that prevents the total absorption of these compounds \n\nwhen applied to skin. The rate-limiting barrier to the absorption of topical cosmetics is \n\nthe stratum corneum, due to its length, which comprehends the number of cell layers, the \n\nthickness, the cell size and the difficulty of this pathway that the substances have to cross \n\n[20]. \n\nThe EC50 of each fraction was also determined, being the results in Table 4.13.

Antioxidant Activities: Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) \n\nscavenging activity \n\nThe anti-radicalar activity of the artichoke extract and the artichoke fraction C was tested \n\nin HaCaT cells exposed to H2O2. As a preliminary assay, it was tested whether the order \n\nof application in cells, samples 30 minutes before H2O2 or simultaneously, affected the \n\nresponse of ROS production by the cells. As showed in Figure 4.25, the application order \n\ndoesn\u2019t affect the production of ROS by the cells, once there are no significant differences \n\nbetween the same samples applied before or simultaneously with the hydrogen peroxide. \n\nTherefore, it was decided to apply the fractions and the hydrogen peroxide \n\nsimultaneously.  \n\n \n\nIn order to study the ROS scavenging effect on the artichoke extract and the artichoke \n\nfraction C, the ascorbic acid was once again chosen as the antioxidant reference. As \n\nshowed in Figure 4.26, both fractions revealed ROS scavenging activity when exposed to \n\nH2O2, a chemical compound responsible for inducing oxidative stress, at concentration of \n\n1 mg/mL. In the assays were the H2O2 was placed 30 minutes before the samples, \n\nartichoke extract, artichoke fraction C and ascorbic acid showed a 93.3, 94.1 and 96.3 % \n\nof reduction of ROS, respectively. When the H2O2 was applied simultaneously with the \n\nsamples, the ascorbic acid showed again the highest percentage of reduction of ROS with \n\n94.9%, and the artichoke extract and the artichoke fraction C showed 92.5 and 93.1%, \n\nrespectively.

The data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD of at least 5 replicates experiments. \n\n \nTaking into account the previous assays, the artichoke extract and the artichoke fraction \n\nC have powerful ROS scavenging effects, once their results are very similar with the ones \n\nobtained for the ascorbic acid, a well-known antioxidant. It should be noted that both \n\nfractions studied before, artichoke extract and artichoke fraction C, are complex mixtures \n\ncomposed of several chemical compounds while the ascorbic acid is a pure compound, \n\nwhich makes the results obtained in these assays even more remarkable. \n\n \n\n4.8. Solar Protection Factor Assay  \n\nFlavonoids are plant pigments that are synthesized from phenylalanine, and several \n\nstudies showed that these compounds have a wide spectrum of pharmacological \n\nproperties, including antioxidative, antiallergic, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, hepato- \n\nand gastro-protective, antiviral, and antineoplastic activities, being extremely important \n\nto human health [23]. Therefore, the content of flavonoids was measure in the artichoke \n\nextract and the supernatant and the results are showed in Table 4.14. \n\nTable 4.14 - Content of flavonoids in the artichoke extract and the artichoke fraction C.

A solution to this \n\nproblem is to use natural products with a great antioxidant capacity (e.g. green coffee) \n\ninstead of chemical filters, which may improve the photoprotective activity of sunscreen \n\nformulations. In fact, these natural products show several advantages, such as the \n\nbioactivity, relative safety and achievement from renewable sources, low cost, besides \n\nthe feasibility for application in a wide range of health care products. As several studies \n\nsuggest that one of the functions of the flavonoids is to protect the plants from potential \n\nharmful solar irradiation [24], [25], artichoke extract and the supernatant, rich sources of \n\nflavonoids and polyphenols, are potential candidates to replace the chemical filters in \n\nsunscreen formulation [26]. The SPF determination for the artichoke extract and the \n\nsupernatant are represented on Table 4.15. \n\nTable 4.15 - SPF found for the natural oils/extracts.

This natural oil showed a SPF of 5.03 \u00b1 0.23, while the \n\nartichoke extract and the supernatant presented 10.99 \u00b1 0.29 and 10.20 \u00b1 0.21, \n\nrespectively. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to compare both fractions \n\nwith the GCO, and the results showed that there is a significant difference between them \n\n(p-values &lt;0.05), being the artichoke extract the compound with the highest SPF. \n\nTherefore, the artichoke extract and the supernatant appears to have an enormous \n\npotential to be applied in sunscreen formulations with the advantages that they are natural, \n\nharmless and powerful antioxidants, which prevents the ROS production due to solar \n\nradiation.  \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n\n4.9. Topical Formulations Preparation \n\n4.9.1. Final Formulations \n\nThe artichoke extract and the artichoke fraction C were chosen to be incorporated in \n\ntopical formulations, as bioactive ingredients, and it was decided to develop two topical \n\nformulations for each fraction, a gel and a cream.  \n\nAs the purpose of this study is to analyze the properties of the formulations containing \n\nthe bioactive ingredients when applied in human skin, then it was decided to use the less \n\ningredients possible to avoid raising doubts about the results obtained for the artichoke \n\nextract and the artichoke fraction C. \n\nFor both gels (containing the artichoke extract (AG) and the gel containing the artichoke \n\nfraction C (CG)), it was decided to use a well-known formulation with the only the basic \n\ningredients. For the cream containing the artichoke extract (AC) and the cream containing \n\nthe artichoke fraction C (CC), was decided to develop a new formula, and for that were \n\nchosen specific ingredients in accordance with the final formulation properties desired. \n\nThe formulations details are fully described in Materials and Methods chapter. \n\nBesides the formulations containing the bioactive ingredients, a blank gel (BG) and a \n\nblank cream (BC) were also prepared following the formulations chosen for each one. \n\nThese blanks were used as a control for the following studies. \n\n \n\n4.9.2. Physico-chemical characterization of formulations  \n\n4.9.2.1. Rheology \n\nRheology characterization is very important in cosmetics once it helps reaching the \n\noptimal formulation that would be appealing to the consumer, choosing the production \n\nequipment and packaging, studying the formulation stability and it is considered a \n\nparameter in quality control [30], [31]. Therefore, in order to study the ability of the \n\ntopical formulations to resist structural breakdown when applied to the skin, a shear-rate \n\nprofile was traced for each formulation prepared. The representative flow curves are \n\nshown in Figure 4.28 and Figure 4.29. Apparent viscosity decreases concurrently with \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \n\nthe increase of shear rate, meaning that all formulations prepared are considered \n\nshearthinning. \n\n \n\n \n\nIn the case of the creams, the flow curves also exhibited hysteresis loops, meaning that \n\nthe formulation suffers a structural breakdown when the stress is applied, and \n\nconsequently the viscosity decreases, but the network is regenerated by energy \n\ninteractions when the stress applied diminishes, and the original viscosity is restored. This \n\nbehavior is typical of time-dependent fluids, since after a sufficient resting time, the \n\nFigure 4.28 - Flow curves of artichoke extract, artichoke fraction C and blank creams representing shear stress as \n\nfunction of shear rate. \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120\n\nS\nh\n\ne\na\n\nr \nS\n\ntr\ne\n\nss\n (\n\nP\na\n\n)\n\nShear Rate (1/S)\n\nArtichoke Artichoke Fraction C Blank\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140\n\nS\nh\n\ne\na\n\nr \nS\n\ntr\ne\n\nss\n (\n\nP\na\n\n)\n\nShear Rate (1/S)\n\nArtichoke Extract Artichoke Fraction C Blank\n\nFigure 4.29 - Flow curves of artichoke extract, artichoke fraction C and blank gels representing shear stress as function \n\nof shear rate. \n\n\n\n72 \n\n \n\noriginal viscosity it recuperated. The viscosity values presented in Table 4.16 show that \n\nthe artichoke fraction C cream is the most and the blank cream is the less viscous \n\nformulation. The polysaccharides present in the plant extracts are possible responsible for \n\nthe rheology behavior observed, since these swell in contact with water [32]. Therefore, \n\nthe emulsions with artichoke extract or artichoke fraction C incorporated showed high \n\nviscosity due to the polysaccharides swelled, while the blank showed the lowest viscous \n\nbehavior because it didn\u2019t have these compounds present in it. The results obtained are in \n\naccord once the artichoke fraction C is the richer fraction in polyphenols, and \n\nconsequently, the most viscous formulation. The opposite was observed for the gel \n\nformulations, since the artichoke fraction C gel was the formulation that presented the \n\nlower and the blank the highest viscosity, as represented in Table 4.16. This behavior may \n\nbe due to the different pH observed before the addition of sodium ions and to the sodium \n\nions themselves, once pH and ionic strength are both parameters that can influence the \n\nrheology properties of carbopol gels [33].  \n\nTable 4.16 - Apparent viscosity values calculated at 61,18s-1 of all formulations. \n\nFormulations Apparent Viscosity (Pa.s) at 68,18 s-1 \n\nArtichoke Fraction C Cream 2.48 \n\nArtichoke Cream 1.9 \n\nBlank Cream 0.9 \n\nArtichoke Fraction C Gel 17.8 \n\nArtichoke Gel 20.4 \n\nBlank Gel 32.4 \n\n \n\n \n\n4.9.2.2. pH Values \n\nThe pH value of the topical products is a very important parameter, since the pH value \n\ncan influence not only the solubility and stability of the bioactive ingredient in the \n\nformulations but also its release from the vehicle and its penetration into the skin barrier \n\n[34], [35]. Therefore, it\u2019s important to evaluate this parameter in each formulation \n\nproduced. If it was out of the ideal pH range, it was corrected adding HCl (decrease pH \n\nvalue) or NaOH (increase pH value), depending of the pH value measured. The pH values \n\nof all formulations prepared are represented in Table 4.17 and all were between 5.4 and \n\n6.4, meaning that all fit well within the ideal pH range for the skin. \n\n \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \n\nTable 4.17 - Determination of pH values of all formulations prepared at environment temperature.

Microbiological Control \n\nCosmetics have several ingredients in their constitution that are carbon sources, like \n\nwater, oil and glycerin, and nitrogen sources, like amino acid derivatives and proteins, for \n\nfungi, bacteria and others microorganisms. Microbiological contamination of cosmetics \n\nproducts can lead to their instability, loss of safety and even the loss of their active \n\ningredients. Therefore, it\u2019s necessary to use preservatives in cosmetics formulations in \n\norder to prevent the growth of bacteria or fungi. In the artichoke extract and supernatant \n\nformulations parabens, in particular methyl paraben and propyl paraben, were used. \n\nBesides that, the water activity (amount of water available for biological processes) in all \n\nformulations was reduced by adding glycerin, which has the capacity to bind with water, \n\nreducing this way the water available in the products, and consequently, naturally \n\npreserving the formulations from contamination [36]. \n\nThus, a microbiological control is a regulatory requirement for cosmetics in order to \n\nensure the microbial safety of the it, to maintain the its quality and specifications and to \n\nguarantee hygienic and high-quality handling [37]. \n\nTotal aerobic microbial count (TAMC) and total combined yeasts and molds count \n\n(TYMC) tests were performed through the spread-plate method for each formulation, and \n\nthe results showed less than 10 colonies in both tests, which resulted from environmental \n\ncontamination, meaning that the result obtain in all cases was less than 100 CFU per gram \n\nor milliliter of product tested. This value is lower than the limit imposed by the ISO \n\n16212:2008 and ISO 21149:2006 defined for these products (Category 2), thus the \n\nproducts prepared are considered microbiologically safe.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n74 \n\n \n\n4.9.4. Formulations Cytotoxicity \n\nTo test the cytotoxicity of all formulations prepared, gels and emulsions, the cell viability \n\nwas evaluated using HaCaT cell lines in a MTT assay. The results obtained for the \n\nformulations containing artichoke and artichoke fraction C were compared to their blanks, \n\nas showed in Figure 4.30.  \n\nFigure 4.30 \u2013 MTT assay measurement of cytotoxicity of topical formulations containing the artichoke extract (black \n\nbars) and artichoke fraction C (squares bars) and their blanks (vertical risks bars). The data are presented as the mean \n\n\u00b1 SD of 6 replicates experiments. \n\n \n\nThe creams containing the artichoke extract and the artichoke fraction C showed 51% and \n\n49% of cell viability, respectively. While the gel containing the artichoke extract showed \n\n51% and the gel with the artichoke fraction C incorporated showed 47%. The cream blank \n\nshowed 94% and the gel blank 90% of cell viability. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) \n\nshowed that the emulsions containing the fractions weren\u2019t significantly different \n\nbetween them (p-value > 0.05). However, a significant difference (p-value &lt;0.05) was \n\nnoted between the emulsions containing the bioactive ingredients and the blank. The same \n\nresults were obtained for the gels.  \n\nAll the formulations containing bioactive ingredients had a poorer cell viability compared \n\nto its blanks, which aren\u2019t harmful to the cells taking into account each ingredient present. \n\nThe formulations showed a cell viability around 50% when compared to its blanks. \n\nTherefore, these results show that AC, AG, CC and CG can preliminary be considered as \n\nsafe.  \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n%\n C\n\ne\nll\n\n V\nia\n\nb\nil\n\nit\ny\n\nBC AC CC BG AG CG\n\ncreams gels\n\nBC \u2013 Blank Cream \n\nAC \u2013 Artichoke Cream \n\nCC \u2013 Artichoke Fraction C Cream \n\nBG \u2013 Blank Gel \n\nAG \u2013 Artichoke Gel \n\nCG - Artichoke Fraction C Gel \n\n\n\n75 \n\n \n\nWhen compared the cell viability of both extracts and their corresponding formulations, \n\nit is possible to observe a substancial increase of the cell viability from the isolated \n\nfractions to the formulations, being the results in Figure 4.31. Analysis of variance \n\n(ANOVA) showed significant differences (p-value &lt;0.05) between the cell viability of \n\nextracts and their respective formulations. Therefore, the vehicle (emulsion or cream) is \n\nable to reduce the cytotoxicity of artichoke extract and artichoke fraction C.  \n\n \n\n4.9.5. Effects on membrane integrity  \n\nIn order to evaluate the effects of the formulations containing the bioactive ingredients \n\non the membrane integrity of cells, an assay using propidium iodide was realized. This \n\ncompound has the can bind to cellular DNA and as it is impermeant to the plasma \n\nmembrane, it has the ability to only enter and stain damaged cells.

The gels with the \n\nartichoke extract and the artichoke fraction C incorporated showed a slightly higher \n\nrelative PI uptake of 1.2 and 1.1, respectively. The creams containing the artichoke extract \n\nand artichoke fraction C showed a relative PI uptake of 1.2 and 1, respectively. Analysis \n\nof variance (ANOVA) showed that the cream containing the artichoke fraction C and the \n\nblank weren\u2019t significant different between them (p-value > 0.05). However, a significant \n\ndifference (p-value &lt;0.05) was noted between the emulsion containing the artichoke \n\nfraction and the emulsion blank. The creams containing the bioactive ingredients were \n\nalso significant different between them. The same analysis showed that the gels \n\ncontaining the bioactive ingredients were significant different between them and when \n\ncompared with their blank. \n\nConsidering that the cell lines are a more sensitive system than the actual skin cells and \n\nthat the differences between the AC and CC formulations and their blank isn\u2019t substantial, \n\nthe results showed that all formulations can be considered not harmful.  \n\n \n\n4.10. Discussion \n\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging activity, solar protection factor (SPF) and \n\ncytotoxicity were studied for the artichoke extract and artichoke fraction C in order to \n\ncompare both extracts.

Since the results in all assays were \n\nidentical for artichoke extract and artichoke fraction C, it was decided to incorporate both \n\nin topical formulations.   \n\nThe topical formulations, a gel and a cream, containing the fractions were subjected to \n\nmicrobiological control, cytotoxicity and membrane integrity assays in order to evaluate \n\ntheir safety for human use. All formulations were considered safe in all assays realized.  \n\nArtichoke extract and artichoke fraction C and their respective formulations exhibited \n\nsimilar results in all assays performed. However, the costs and time of production of both \n\nfractions are very different. Artichoke fraction C required a larger amount of time and \n\nmoney to be produced, once it needs to be subjected to several procedures, including the \n\nprecipitation of mucilage, and the washing and lyophilization processes. Therefore, \n\ntaking into account the results and the costs and time of production of each fraction, it \n\nwas decided to use only the formulations containing the artichoke extract in the following \n\nin vitro and in vivo studies. \n\n \n\n4.11. In Vitro Studies: Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) \n\nscavenging activity \n\nIn order to study the ROS scavenging effect of the gel and the cream containing the \n\nartichoke extract, the ascorbic acid was once again chosen as the antioxidant reference. \n\nAs showed in Figure 4.33, both formulations revealed ROS scavenging activity when \n\nexposed to H2O2. The artichoke extract gel, artichoke extract cream and the ascorbic acid \n\nshowed a 92.8, 90.3 and 95.7% of ROS reduction, respectively. Analysis of variance \n\n(ANOVA) was performed and the results showed significant differences (p-value &lt;0.05) \n\nbetween both formulations and between each formulation and the ascorbic acid. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n78 \n\n \n\n \n\nAnother assay using UVB radiation as an inducer of antioxidant stress was performed, \n\nbeing the results in Figure 4.34.

Human Repeat Insult Patch Tes ting (HRIPT)  \n\nNo evidence for the induction of allergic contact hypersensitivity was observed during \n\nthe HRIPT assay, neither in the induction or in the challenge period. Therefore, the \n\nformulations showed very good skin compatibility and didn\u2019t exhibited allergenic \n\npotential, which makes them skin-friendly and dermatologically safe products. \n\n \n\n4.12.2. Assessment of the protective effect against oxidative stress \n\nafter UV radiation by chromameter evaluation  \n\nUV radiation is one of the factors that induce photo damage in the skin due to the \n\nproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) also known as free radicals. To prevent the \n\nreactions of free radicals, the human body has developed defense mechanisms known as \n\nantioxidants, however they can be inhibited by UV radiation and increase the formation \n\nof more ROS.  \n\n?-carotene is a Yellow chromophore molecule and when is oxidized by UV radiation it \n\nloses its chromophore capability and color. This discoloration can be monitored by \n\ncolorimetry (b* parameter). Skin color is obtained using a tristimulus color analyzer that \n\nmeasures reflected color. The system uses ?-carotene high sensitivity photocells filtered \n\nto match CIE standard. The measuring head contains a high-power xenon arc lamp which \n\nprovides diffuse illumination from a controlled angle for vertical viewing and constant \n\nlighting on the object.  The system detects any slight deviation in the xenon\u2019s light \n\nspectral distribution. The system provides data for the Luminance (L*), a* (red-green) \n\nand b*(blue-yellow) color distribution.  \n\nThe protective effect against oxidative stress was evaluated by a Minolta Chromameter \n\nCR-400 (Minolta, Japan) in order to obtain the b* color, which is a measure along the \n\nyellow-blue axis (positive b* relates to the amount of yellowness and a negative b* to the \n\namount of blueness), before and after the application of the products, including the \n\nformulations containing artichoke extract. ?-carotene was the chromophore chosen as a \n\nreference in this procedure. The results obtained for the b* color measurement in the first \n\nday (D0) and the last day (D28) of the study are presented in Table 4.18. \n\n \n\n\n\n80 \n\n \n\nTable 4.18 - Summary results of the evolution of b* color (AU) during the HRIPT assay. \n\n  Time n Basal \nBefore \n\nirradiation \n\nAfter \n\nirradiation \n\nb* \n\nArtichoke Gel + ?-\n\ncarotene \n\nD0 10 16,8 36,3 33,2 \n\nD28 10 16,8 35,8 34,3 \n\nArtichoke Cream + \n\n?-carotene \n\nD0 10 16,9 41,6 38,6 \n\nD28 10 16,9 40,0 38,1 \n\nControl \nD0 10 14,8 40,0 38,2 \n\nD28 10 15,0 36,6 36,0 \n\n \n\nTo evaluate the true anti-oxidant activity obtained in each area at the end of the study, a \n\nrelative analysis regarding D0 was performed, being the results summarized in Figure \n\n4.35. A product shows antioxidant activity when a decrease in the oxidant activity of the \n\nUVA radiation occurs.  \n\nRegarding the anti-oxidant capacity, the product artichoke extract gel presented an 87.0% \n\ndecrease in the oxidant activity of the UVA radiation. At the same time, the product \n\nartichoke extract cream presented an 75.8% decrease in the oxidant activity of the UVA \n\nradiation. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed significant difference (p-value &lt;0.05) \n\nbetween artichoke extract gel and the control, and the opposite occurred for the artichoke \n\nextract cream. Therefore, the artichoke extract gel presented a true in vivo antioxidant \n\nactivity.  \n\n  \n\nFigure 4.35 - Oxidant activity % change during the study after the exposure to artichoke extract gel (white bar with \nblack dots) and artichoke extract cream (black bar with white dots).

Discussion \n\nIn the ROS scavenging activity assays using H2O2 as inducer of antioxidant stress, the \n\nartichoke extract showed a ROS reduction of 92.5%, while the gel and the cream \n\ncontaining it showed 92.8 and 90.3%, respectively. In the assays using UV radiation, \n\nartichoke extract, and the gel and cream containing it presented 92.8, 80.5 and 79.6% of \n\nROS reduction. Overall, the artichoke extract resulted in a higher percentage of ROS \n\nreduction. This result is probably due to the availability of the artichoke extract, free form \n\nor incorporated in a matrix. Aqueous artichoke extract when applied in the cells allows \n\nthe direct contact of artichoke extract in its free form with the cells, resulting in an \n\nimmediate antiradicalar action. On the opposite, the matrices of the formulations, cream \n\nand gel, are able to retain the artichoke extract, releasing it slowly to the medium with the \n\ncells, thus the action of it in has less impact due to a more extended response.  \n\nIn vivo studies showed that the gel containing the artichoke extract presented an 87.0% \n\ndecrease in the oxidant activity induced by UVA radiation, while the artichoke extract \n\ncream presented 75.8%. These results are in accordance with the ones obtained from the \n\nlatest in vitro studies, since the gel with the artichoke extract incorporated showed the \n\nhighest antioxidant capacity in both cases. Release profiles of the artichoke extract from \n\nboth formulations can explain the differences of antioxidant activities observed between \n\nthe cream and the gel. In this case, the matrix of the gel may be able to release the \n\nartichoke extract in a more efficient and faster way than the matrix of the cream. Patel et \n\nal. [38] studied the percentage of release of psoralen from two distinct formulations, a gel \n\nand a cream, and the results also showed a higher release profile of psoralen from the gel \n\nformulations than that from the cream formulations.  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n82 \n\n \n\n4.14.

Scolymus is a rich source of polyphenols, which are responsible \n\nfor its antioxidant properties, and it is highly produced by Mediterranean countries, such \n\nas France, Spain, Italy and Greece. Currently, plant extracts are being preferable to be \n\nused in cosmetics products due to the prohibition of the use of animal origin ingredients \n\nto an increase search for ecofriendly and sustainable products. Therefore, artichoke can \n\npotential be a specie of interest to be incorporated in cosmetic products with antioxidant \n\npurposes. \n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the antioxidant properties of artichoke extract \n\nand its use as a bioactive ingredient in topical formulations with antioxidant purposes.  \n\nInfusion revealed to be an efficient procedure to extract bioactive compounds from \n\nartichoke bracts. Regarding polyphenols, an analysis of artichoke extract revealed the \n\npresence up to 56 of chlorogenic acid, 7 of cynaroside and 83 of cynarin, which values \n\nwere expressed in \u00b5g/mg of artichoke extract. A characterization of artichoke extract \n\nshowed that it is composed by 62.8% of fibers, 3.06 of polyphenols, 0.82% of \n\ncarbohydrates and 0.002% of proteins. DPPH radical scavenging activity assay of \n\nartichoke extract was realized and it was obtained an EC50 of 99 \u00b5g/mL.  \n\nPurification of artichoke extract through an acidic digestion with gastric juice followed \n\nby a 24 hours\u2019 dialysis, which resulted in artichoke fraction A, proved to be efficient in \n\nimproving polyphenols content, from 31 to 35 \u00b5g/mg of artichoke extract. However, the \n\namount of extractives, expressed in \u00b5g/mg artichoke extract, decreased from 56 to 42 for \n\nchlorogenic acid, from 83 to 71 for cynarin and for cynaroside the value remained equal. \n\nConcerning its antioxidant activity, was recorded an improvement from 99 to 95 \u00b5g/mL. \n\nMucilage precipitation method was tested using two different approaches, one using \n\nacetic acid and the other only using ethanol, which resulted in artichoke fractions B and \n\nC, respectively. Regarding polyphenols, artichoke fraction B exhibited 27 ?g/ mg of \n\nartichoke extract and artichoke fraction C exhibited 23 ?g/ mg of artichoke extract. DPPH \n\nassay revealed an EC50 of 67 and 56 to artichoke fractions B and C, respectively. A \n\nchemical analysis of artichoke fraction B revealed the presence of 63, 82 and 14 ?g/ mg \n\n\n\n85 \n\n \n\nof artichoke extract of chlorogenic acid, cynarin and cynaroside, respectively; artichoke \n\nfraction C revealed the presence of 68, 83 and 18 ?g/ mg of artichoke extract of \n\nchlorogenic acid, cynarin and cynaroside, respectively.  \n\nAn overview of the results obtained from purification methods showed that artichoke \n\nfraction C was the fraction with better antioxidant activity. However, this was also the \n\nfraction with lowest phenolic content, despite the increased content of chlorogenic acid, \n\ncynarin and cynaroside. But since the main goal was to incorporate the fraction with better \n\nantioxidant properties in topical formulations with antioxidant purposes, the artichoke \n\nfraction C was the chosen one to proceed with the study.  \n\nCytotoxicity assays in HaCaT cell lines revealed that both fractions decreased cell \n\nviability to 18.3% in artichoke extract and 21.3% in artichoke fraction C. ROS scavenging \n\nactivity assay using hydrogen peroxide and UVB radiation revealed powerful antioxidant \n\nactivity for artichoke fraction C and artichoke extract. In the assay using H2O2, ascorbic \n\nacid reduced 94.9% of ROS, while artichoke extract and artichoke fraction C reduced \n\n92.5 and 93.1%, respectively. In the UVB radiation assay, significant differences (p-value \n\n&lt;0.05) between ascorbic acid, artichoke extract and artichoke fraction C weren\u2019t \n\nobserved; artichoke extract and the artichoke fraction C showed 92.8 and 94.2% of ROS \n\nreduction, while ascorbic acid showed 95.7%. Both fractions also revealed to be rich in \n\nflavonoids (31 ?g/mg of extract for artichoke extract and 39 ?g/mg of extract for artichoke \n\nfraction C) and to have solar protection factor, which values were found between 10 and \n\n11. \n\nTopical formulations, a cream and a hydrogel, were prepared and both fractions, artichoke \n\nextract and artichoke fraction C, were incorporated in them. A physical-chemical \n\ncharacterization was performed for each formulation and all products showed acid pH \n\nvalues and shearthinning behavior, thus they were considered suitable for skin \n\napplication. Assays of cytotoxicity and effects on membrane integrity in keranocytes, and \n\na microbiological control showed that all formulations were also suitable for topical \n\napplication. \n\nObserving the results obtained in the analysis of both fractions and their respective \n\nformulations, and taking into account the costs and time of production of each fraction, \n\nformulations containing the artichoke extract, a cream and a hydrogel, were chosen to be \n\n\n\n86 \n\n \n\nused in more in vitro studies and in vivo studies. In vitro studies included a ROS \n\nscavenging activity assay using hydrogen peroxide and UVB radiation, and in vivo studies \n\nincluded a Human Repeat Insult Patch Testing (HRIPT) and an assessment of the \n\nprotective effect against oxidative stress after UV radiation by chromameter evaluation. \n\nIn the in vitro studies using H2O2 as oxidative stress inducer, the gel and the cream \n\ncontaining the artichoke extract showed a ROS reduction of 92.8 and 90.3%, respectively. \n\nIn the assay with UVB radiation, the gel showed 80.5% and the cream showed 79.6% of \n\nROS reduction. Overall, the formulations presented a lowest antioxidant activity against \n\nboth inducers when compared with the artichoke extract in its free form (92.5% for H2O2 \n\nassay; 92.8% for the UV radiation assay). \n\nIn vivo studies performed in volunteers demonstrated very good skin compatibility and \n\nno allergenic potential for both formulations, so they were considered dermatologically \n\nsafe. Regarding antioxidant capacity, artichoke gel and cream exhibited an 87.0% and \n\n75.8% decrease in the oxidant activity of the UVA radiation, respectively. In this assay, \n\nthe artichoke gel was the topical formulation that presented a true in vivo antioxidant \n\nactivity. \n\nIn both studies, in vitro and in vivo, the gel formulation presented the highest antioxidant \n\nactivity, which can be explain by a higher release profile of the artichoke extract. \n\nFormulations containing artichoke extract proved to be suitable, safe and efficient for skin \n\napplication and for antioxidant purposes. Therefore, the main goal of this thesis was \n\naccomplished. \n\n  \n\n\n\n87 \n\n \n\n6. Chapter: Annexes  \n6.1.
