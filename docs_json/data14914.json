De \nacordo com as previs\u00f5es, a mudan\u00e7a de temperatura dever\u00e1 ser superior a 1,5\u00baC neste \ns\u00e9culo e o aquecimento \u00e9 prov\u00e1vel que continue. Os ecossistemas de \u00e1gua doce est\u00e3o \nentre os mais sens\u00edveis, principalmente devido \u00e0s mudan\u00e7as no ciclo hidrol\u00f3gico e, \nconsequentemente, em diversos par\u00e2metros f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmicos (ex. pH, oxig\u00e9nio \ndissolvido). Altera\u00e7\u00f5es nos par\u00e2metros abi\u00f3ticos de ambientes de \u00e1gua doce ir\u00e3o \nprovavelmente afectar a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o, morfologia, fisiologia e riqueza de uma ampla \ngama de esp\u00e9cies levando a mudan\u00e7as importantes na biodiversidade e funcionamento \ndo ecossistema. Para al\u00e9m disto, eles tamb\u00e9m podem atuar como co-estressores em \nambientes onde os organismos j\u00e1 tem que lidar com contamina\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica. Portanto, o \nobjetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar os efeitos de par\u00e2metros ambientais sobre a \ntoxicidade dos pesticidas para embri\u00f5es de peixe-zebra. Foram estudados os seguintes \nfatores ambientais: pH  (3,0-12,0), n\u00edvel de oxig\u00e9nio dissolvido (0-8 mg/L) e radia\u00e7\u00e3o UV \n(0-500 mW/m2). Os pesticidas estudados foram o inseticida carbamato carbaril e o \nfungicida benzimidaz\u00f3lico carbendazim. Ambos os estressores (fatores ambientais e \npesticidas) foram testados separadamente a fim de obter curvas dose-resposta para \nestudar mais profundamente os efeitos combinados de estressores ambientais e \ntoxicidade qu\u00edmica, aplicando modelos de mistura. A caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o das respostas do \npeixe-zebra ao estresse ambiental mostrou que os efeitos do pH foram totalmente \nestabelecidas ap\u00f3s 24 h de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o e a sobreviv\u00eancia foi s\u00f3 afetada a valores de pH \nabaixo de 5 e acima 10. Os n\u00edveis reduzidos de oxig\u00e9nio tamb\u00e9m afetaram o \ndesenvolvimento dos embri\u00f5es em concentra\u00e7\u00f5es abaixo de 4 mg/L (atraso, redu\u00e7\u00e3o \ndos batimentos card\u00edacos e edema) e em concentra\u00e7\u00f5es abaixo de 0.5 mg/L a \nsobreviv\u00eancia foi drasticamente reduzida. A exposi\u00e7\u00e3o cont\u00ednua a radia\u00e7\u00f5es UV \nmostrou um forte efeito dependente do tempo na sobreviv\u00eancia dos embri\u00f5es levando a \n100% de mortalidade no final do ensaio. A toxicidade dos pesticidas carbaril e \ncarbendazim foi caracterizada em v\u00e1rios n\u00edveis de organiza\u00e7\u00e3o biol\u00f3gica, incluindo \ndesenvolvimento, biomarcadores e comportamental, permitindo uma compreens\u00e3o \nmecanicista dos efeitos e destacando a utilidade de respostas comportamentais \n(locomo\u00e7\u00e3o) como um par\u00e2metro sens\u00edvel em ecotoxicologia. \nUma vez que as curvas dose resposta para cada estressor foram estabelecidas, um \nestudo de toxicidade combinado foi realizado para avaliar os efeitos do pH sobre a\ntoxicidade do carbaril. \nOs resultados mostraram que o pH pode modificar a toxicidade do pesticida carbaryl. O \nmodelo conceitual de adi\u00e7\u00e3o da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o permitiu uma previs\u00e3o precisa da \ntoxicidade dos efeitos conjuntos do pH \u00e1cido e carbaril. No entanto, para a condi\u00e7\u00e3o \nalcalina ambos os conceitos falharam na previs\u00e3o dos efeitos. Os desvios ao modelo \nforam no entanto f\u00e1ceis de explicar uma vez que os valores de pH elevados\nfavoreceram a hidr\u00f3lise do carbaril com a consequente forma\u00e7\u00e3o de um produto de \ndegrada\u00e7\u00e3o mais t\u00f3xico 1-naftol. Embora no presente estudo tal processo explicativo foi \nf\u00e1cil de estabelecer, para muitas outras combina\u00e7\u00f5es de natureza \"interativa\" talvez \nesse processo n\u00e3o seja t\u00e3o evidente. No contexto das altera\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas poucos \ncen\u00e1rios preveem um aumento t\u00e3o elevado do pH de sistemas aqu\u00e1ticos, no entanto, \nesta pode ser considerada uma primeira abordagem focada apenas nos efeitos letais. \nNuma segunda avalia\u00e7\u00e3o, efeitos ao n\u00edvel sub-letal seriam recomendados uma vez que \nespera-se que mudan\u00e7as mais sutis de pH (mais realistas em termos de cen\u00e1rios de \nmudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas) possam ter um efeito em n\u00edveis fisiol\u00f3gicos e bioqu\u00edmicos, com \nposs\u00edveis consequ\u00eancias a longo prazo para o fitness das popula\u00e7\u00f5es. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nKeywords \n \n\nEcotoxicology, zebrafish, aquatic ecosystems, climate change, global warming, mixture \ntoxicity, concentration addition, independent action, pesticides, dissolved oxygen, pH, \nUltraviolet radiation  \n\nAbstract \n \n\nDuring the last century mean global temperatures have been increasing. According to \nthe predictions, the temperature change is expected to exceed 1.5\u00baC in this century and \nthe warming is likely to continue. Freshwater ecosystems are among the most sensitive \nmainly due to changes in the hydrologic cycle and consequently changes in several \nphysico-chemical parameters (e.g. pH, dissolved oxygen). Alterations in environmental \nparameters of freshwater systems are likely to affect distribution, morphology, physiology \nand richness of a wide range of species leading to important changes in ecosystem \nbiodiversity and function. Moreover, they can also work as co-stressors in environments \nwhere organisms have already to cope with chemical contamination (such as \npesticides), increasing the environmental risk due to potential interactions. Therefore, the \nobjective of this work was to evaluate the effects of climate change related \nenvironmental parameters on the toxicity of pesticides to zebrafish embryos. The \nfollowing environmental factors were studied: pH (3.0-12.0), dissolved oxygen level (0-8 \nmg/L) and UV radiation (0-500 mW/m2). The pesticides studied were the carbamate \ninsecticide carbaryl and the benzimidazole fungicide carbendazim. Stressors were firstly \ntested separately in order to derive concentration- or intensity-response curves to further \nstudy the effects of binary combinations (environmental factors x pesticides) by applying \nmixture models. Characterization of zebrafish embryos response to environmental stress \nrevealed that pH effects were fully established after 24 h of exposure and survival was \nonly affected at pH values below 5 and above 10. Low oxygen levels also affected \nembryos development at concentrations below 4 mg/L (delay, heart rate decrease and \nedema), and at concentrations below 0.5 mg/L the survival was drastically reduced. \nContinuous exposure to UV radiation showed a strong time-dependent impact on \nembryos survival leading to 100% of mortality after 72 hours of exposure. The toxicity of \npesticides carbaryl and carbendazim was characterized at several levels of biological \norganization including developmental, biochemical and behavioural allowing a \nmechanistic understanding of the effects and highlighting the usefulness of behavioural \nresponses (locomotion) as a sensitive endpoint in ecotoxicology. \nOnce the individual concentration response relationship of each stressor was \nestablished, a combined toxicity study was conducted to evaluate the effects of pH on \nthe toxicity of carbaryl.  \nWe have shown that pH can modify the toxicity of the pesticide carbaryl. The conceptual \nmodel concentration addition allowed a precise prediction of the toxicity of the joint-\neffects of acid pH and carbaryl. Nevertheless, for alkaline condition both concepts failed \nin predicting the effects. Deviations to the model were however easy to explain as high \npH values favour the hydrolysis of carbaryl with the consequent formation of the more \ntoxic degradation product 1- naphtol. Although in the present study such explanatory \nprocess was easy to establish, for many other combinations the \u201cinteractive\u201d nature is \nnot so evident. In the context of the climate change few scenarios predict such increase \nin the pH of aquatic systems, however this was a first approach focused in the lethal \neffects only. In a second tier assessment effects at sublethal level would be sought and it \nis expectable that more subtle pH changes (more realistic in terms of climate changes \nscenarios) may have an effect at physiological and biochemical levels with possible long \nterm consequences for the population fitness.  \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nINDEX \n \n \nChapter 1 \u2013 General Introduction ............................................................................ 12 \n \n\n \n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Pesticide contamination in a changing environment: the role of pH, UV \nradiation and oxygen depletion in the modulation of toxicity ....................................... 28 \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Zebrafish embryo tolerance to environmental stress-factors \nconcentration/dose response analysis of oxygen limitation, pH and UV \u2013 light \n\nirradiation ................................................................................................................... 60 \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Effects of carbaryl in zebrafish embryos development and locomotion ....  \n ................................................................................................................................... 94 \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Carbendazim exposure induced physiological, biochemical and behavior \ndisturbance in zebrafish embryos .............................................................................. 122 \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Influence of pH on the toxicity of carbaryl to zebrafish early life stage ....  \n ................................................................................................................................. 160 \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 7 \u2013 General Discussion ............................................................................ 190 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nList of Tables and Figures \n\nList of Tables \n \nChapter 2 \n \nTable 1 - Summary of studies concerning interaction between acid and alkaline pH and \npesticides.  \n \nTable 2 - Summary of studies concerning interactions between depletion of dissolved oxygen. \nand pesticides  \n \nTable 3 - Summary of studies concerning interactions between UV and pesticides. \n \n \nChapter 3 \n \nTable 1 \u2013 Buffers used for pH stabilization: concentrations used, respective pH range \nand toxicity data. \n \nTable 2 \u2013 Summary of LCx and ECx values (\u00b1 Standard error) along 96 h of exposure to \nenvironmental parameters.

General Introduction \n\n1.1 Contextualization \n\n \n\nStrong scientific evidences have demonstrated that global climate is changing and \n\nin some extent responsibilities can be attributed to human activities. The warming \n\nobserved since the mid-20th century is mainly due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas \n\nemissions (GHG), such as carbon dioxide and methane. Despite the effort to reduce \n\nemissions, GHG have largely increased between 2000 and 2010 (IPCC, 2014). The most \n\nrecent assessment report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2014) \n\nindicated that the last three decades were the warmest at the Earth\u2019s surface since 1850. \n\nMoreover, the warming is predicted to continue beyond the 21st century in all scenarios \n\nand the temperature increase may reach 4.8 \u00baC. Changes in climate have caused impacts on \n\nhuman and natural systems in recent decades with strongest impacts on natural systems. \n\nFig.1 summarizes the impacts of climate change on natural and human systems based on \n\navailable scientific publication from 2001 to 2010. As can be observed, the impacts of \n\nclimate change are strongest and most comprehensive for natural systems. Changes in \n\nprecipitation or melting snow and ice for instance may affect quantity and quality of water \n\nresources (IPCC, 2014). \n\nAquatic ecosystems are particularly susceptible to climate change because of their \n\nstrong dependence on precipitation and hydrologic cycles (Allan et al., 2005). These \n\nprocesses affect not only the quantity of water but also its quality. Indeed, recent studies \n\nemphasized the relationship of climatic and hydrological parameters to surface water \n\nquality. For instance, a negative correlation between climate related parameters such as \n\nprecipitation, evaporation, air temperatures, water level and discharge flow and \n\nmodifications in Dissolved Oxygen (DO), pH and conductivity was found in the Mekong \n\nRiver (Prathumratana et al., 2008). In addition, a clear relationship between temperature \n\nincrease and water quality changes, namely nutrient loadings (soluble reactive phosphorus, \n\nnitrate among others) was reported in semi-arid streams in Spain (Ben\u00edtez-Gilabert et al., \n\n2010). These changes in physicochemical characteristics of freshwater environments affect \n\ndirectly and indirectly the biodiversity of ecosystems, with changes in distribution, \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n13 \n \n\nmorphology, physiology and richness of many species (Mezcua et al., 2004; C. M. O. \n\nReilly et al., 2003). \n\nFigure 1: Widespread impacts attributed to climate change based on the available scientific \nliterature since 2000. Symbols indicate categories of attributed impacts, the relative contribution of \nclimate change to the observed impact and confidence in attribution. Number in ovals indicates \nregional totals of climate change publications from 2001 to 2010 (IPCC Synthesis report, 2014).  \n\n \n\nThe immediate effects of global climate change in hydrologic patterns may \n\nindirectly cause alterations in the physicochemical water properties with temperature being \n\na determinant factor affecting almost all physicochemical parameters and biological \n\nprocesses. pH is an important environmental factor conditioning survival of many \n\nfreshwater species. Water pH depends on a complexity of factors including temperature. \n\nFor example, during a drought period in the Meuse river van Vliet &amp; Zwolsman (2008) \n\nobserved an increase in the pH reflecting a decrease in CO2 concentration due to \n\nproliferation of algae blooms elicited by higher water temperature and nutrients \n\nconcentrations. Fluctuations in pH may compromise physiological fitness of aquatic life \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n14 \n \n\nand also influence the speed of chemical reactions, degradations and bioavailability of \n\ncontaminants. The DO in water can vary temporally and spatially and these changes are \n\ndirectly related to atmospheric gas exchange, temperature and may also be related to \n\neutrophication phenomena (van Vliet and Zwolsman, 2008). A temperature increase, for \n\nexample, can cause a decrease in oxygen concentration due to the lower water capacity to \n\ncarry oxygen (Kundzewicz and Krysanova, 2010). DO has also an important role in the \n\nphysiology of aquatic organisms and at low levels has been shown to affect survival and \n\ndevelopment of fish and invertebrate organisms (Ferreira et al., 2008; K\u00fcster and \n\nAltenburger, 2008; Padilla and Roth, 2001). Other important environmental factor \n\nconditioning survival of aquatic organisms is ultraviolet (UV) radiation. In the case of UV \n\nradiation, the depletion of the stratospheric ozone along with changes in dissolved organic \n\nmatter (DOM) (as changes in climate may lead to a reduction of DOM in water), may lead \n\nto an enhanced exposure of aquatic life to UV-B radiation which can also compromise \n\nsurvival and development of aquatic organisms as demonstrated by many studies (Charron \n\net al., 2000; H\u00e4kkinen et al., 2002; Oromi et al., 2008). The risks of fluctuations in the \n\nabove mentioned environmental parameters are exacerbated as they may be able to modify \n\nthe toxicity of chemical compounds and/or act as an additional stress to aquatic life.  \n\nChanges in climate will also affect the development and geographical distribution \n\nof many agricultural pests, diseases and weeds, caused mainly by alterations in \n\ntemperature, precipitation and wind patterns (Patterson et al., 1999). In particular, climate \n\nchange will cause the spreading of insect-borne diseases and pests (Koleva and Schneider, \n\n2009; Porter et al., 1991) as well as the increased incidence of weeds (Coakley, 1999). For \n\ninstance, 1\u00ba C increase in temperature will influence the development rate and distribution \n\nof the European Corn Borer inducing a northward extension (up to 1200 km) of this pest, \n\nas predicted by Porter, Parry et al. (1991). The increased incidence of existing pests, \n\ndiseases and weeds predicted under climate change scenarios may imply an extensive and \n\nmore frequent application of pesticides (Koleva and Schneider, 2009; J. Reilly et al., \n\n2003). Chen and McCarl (2001) studied the relationship between climate change and \n\npesticide usage in US agriculture by employing projected climate change scenarios. Their \n\nresults suggest that climate change will considerably increase pesticide use/costs in US \n\nagriculture. This will imply that more pesticides residues will reach the aquatic \n\nenvironment by runoff or leaching from agricultural fields which may increase their \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n15 \n \n\nconcentrations and bioavailability to aquatic biota and, thus, affecting the survival of the \n\nmost sensitive species.  \n\nThus, in some climate changes scenarios species have to cope not only with \n\nvariations of natural environmental parameters such as pH, DO and UV radiation that may \n\nfallout of their optimal range but also with an increased load of pollutants as it is the case \n\nof pesticides. Moreover, and with particular relevance for this thesis, chemical, physical or \n\nbiological interactions between these two types of stressors (environmental X chemical) \n\nmay occur, exacerbating ecological risk for aquatic systems. However, these possible \n\ninteractions are not usually taken into account in the toxicity evaluation and in the risk \n\nassessment of chemicals. The toxicity evaluation is carried out by exposing organisms in \n\n\u201cstandard conditions\u201d where temperature, oxygen and pH are held constant. These \n\nconditions do not always reflect the heterogeneity and the multiple stress factors that \n\nnatural populations experience in the wild and, more importantly, do not take into account \n\nthe upcoming changes resulting from global alterations leading to inaccurate ecological \n\nrisk assessment. Therefore, in order to improve risk assessment, new methodologies need \n\nto be designed, considering the evaluation of combined stress of environmental factors and \n\nchemicals.  \n\nA model organism that could be suitable to address this issue should have particular \n\ncharacteristics including: i) relatively well understood growth and development; ii) \n\nrelatively easy to grow and maintain in laboratory; iii) relatively short generation time; iv) \n\nclosely resemble others organisms or systems; v) be compliant with ethical \n\nlegislation/requirements/issues and vi) provide a set of easily quantifiable functional \n\nparameters allowing mode of action analysis among other features. This last is an essential \n\nrequirement in a model organism and encompasses a good knowledge on the species \n\nbiology and biochemical processes. The development of adequate technology is also \n\nimportant in order to enable precise measurements of responses and high throughput \n\nanalyses. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) shows to fulfill these requirements, being an \n\nexcellent model to unravel mechanisms of combined toxicity in the aim of this thesis as \n\nexplained below. Zebrafish is a small tropical fish indigenous to South Asia and India. \n\nRecently, it has become a popular model in many fields of science including human \n\ndisease (Bakkers, 2011), genetics (Haffter and N\u00fcsslein-Volhard, 1996), pharmacology \n\n(Redfern et al., 2008) and (eco)toxicology (Braunbeck et al., 2014, 2005; Lammer et al., \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n16 \n \n\n2009; Scholz et al., 2008). A number of unique attributes have contributed to its rise in \n\npopularity as a model organism: \n\n(1) Zebrafish are easy and economic to maintain; \n\n(2) They have a small size; \n\n(3) They present a high fecundity producing a large number of embryos; \n\n(4) Embryos develop rapid and outside the mother; \n\n(5) Zebrafish development has been well characterized including morphological and \n\nphysiological information at all stages of early development (Kimmel et al., 1995); \n\n(6) The transparency of embryos allows unobstructed observation of the main \n\nmorphological changes during earlier developmental stages; \n\n(7) Zebrafish genome is completely characterized. \n\nIn the process of risk assessment of chemicals (plant protection products, \n\npesticides, pharmaceuticals, effluents, etc.), a set of ecotoxicological tests is required for \n\nchemical toxicity assessment including the acute toxicity test with vertebrates (Scholz et \n\nal., 2013). The implementation of the new European Union regulation for the Registration, \n\nEvaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH) is certainly increasing dramatically \n\nthe animal testing (Piersma, 2006). Moreover, the global production of chemicals is \n\nincreasing with tons of new substances released in the market every year. However, within \n\nthe current animal welfare legislation in Europe which demands the incorporation of the \n\n3Rs principles (replacement, reduction, refinement), testing with vertebrate animals should \n\nbe reduced or even replaced by alternative methods (EU, 2010). In this context, the \n\nzebrafish embryo toxicity test has emerged as a true alternative \u2013 or at least a refinement \u2013 \n\nfor the acute fish toxicity test (Braunbeck et al., 2014, 2005; Scholz et al., 2013, 2008; \n\nSchulte and Nagel, 1994). The approval of the OECD testing guideline n\u00ba 236 has \n\nconsolidated the fish embryo test (FET) with zebrafish as a test to assess toxicity of the \n\nembryonic forms of fish and a full alternative for the use of vertebrates (OECD, 2013). \n\nThe use of embryonic forms of fish has numerous advantages. Particularly, early \n\nlife stages of fish (characterized by lack of independent feeding) are considered as non-\n\nprotected life stages complying with the ethical framework of the 3Rs (EU, 2010). In the \n\ncase of zebrafish, besides all the advantages mentioned before, numerous studies have \n\nreported the good accordance of zebrafish embryos assays with the acute adult test \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n17 \n \n\n(Belanger et al., 2013; Lammer et al., 2009) and in vivo results in mammals (Selderslaghs \n\net al., 2009). In addition, the FET test enables the monitoring of a whole organism from \n\nearly embryogenesis (1.5 hpf \u2013 hours post fertilization), until hatching (48-72 hpf) and \n\nbeyond (96-120 hpf).  Furthermore, the FET is less time consuming and requires very low \n\nvolumes of test solution.  \n\nBriefly, the zebrafish embryos toxicity test consists in exposing newly fertilized \n\neggs (?1.5 hpf) to the test chemical for a total period of 96 h (Fig 2). During this period, \n\nthe embryos are evaluated daily and four observations are performed as indicators of \n\nlethality: coagulation of embryos, lack of somite formation, non-detachment of the tail and \n\nlack of heartbeat. In addition, hatching is also recorded daily starting form 48 hpf until the \n\nend of the test. \n\n \n\nFig 2: Schematic overview of the fish embryo acute toxicity test procedure. \nBraunbeck et al (2014).  \n \n\nThe assessment of sub-lethal endpoints in the FET assay such as changes in heart \n\nbeat, presence of edema and deformities, changes in length, altered behaviour among \n\nothers makes this test a powerful tool for the detection of effects at several levels and may \n\nprovide information on the mode of action and, finally, indicate long-term effects of \n\nchemicals (Scholz et al., 2008). \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n18 \n \n\n1.2 Aim and outline  \n \n\nRegarding the several direct and indirect impacts of climate change on aquatic \n\nenvironments and, at the same time, recognizing the complexity of environmental risk \n\nassessment for the combination of two or more stressors, this thesis aims to contribute to \n\nthe discussion concerning the influence of climate change related environmental factors \n\n(pH, DO and Ultraviolet radiation) on the toxicity of pesticides. Therefore, the main goal \n\nof this thesis is to evaluate the toxicity of binary combinations of environmental \n\nparameters and pesticides using zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos as a model. In order to \n\naccomplish this goal, both stressors (environmental factors and pesticides) were evaluated \n\nseparately and in combination and thus 3 specific objectives were established:   \n\n1) To evaluate the effects of the environmental factors pH, DO and UV radiation on \n\nthe development of zebrafish embryos in order to establish clear concentration-\n\nresponse relationships to be further used in combined experiments with chemical \n\ncompounds; \n\n2) To study the toxicity of the selected pesticides (the carbamate insecticide carbaryl \n\nand the benzimidazole fungicide carbendazim) combining lethal (survival) and \n\nsublethal (developmental, biochemical and behaviour parameters) endpoints to \n\nzebrafish embryos in order to better understand their toxic effects by expanding the \n\nsensitivity of the test and also to establish concentration response relationships to \n\nbe posteriorly used in the combined experiments.   \n\n3) Ultimately, to study the influence of environmental factors on the toxicity of \n\npesticides by testing the binary combination of pH (acidic and alkaline) and \n\ncarbaryl based on the previously established individual toxicity of each stressor.  \n\n \n\nThis thesis is composed by seven chapters. The chapter 1 consists of this \n\ncontextualization and a brief introduction with an overview of the climate change process \n\nand its subsequent effects on aquatic environments. Chapters 2 to 6 are structured as \n\nscientific papers (two submitted and the others in preparation to be submitted in \n\ninternational peer reviewed scientific journals) and present all results of effects assessment \n\nof environmental factors (pH acid and alkaline, low DO levels and ultraviolet radiation) \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n19 \n \n\nand pesticides (carbaryl and carbendazim) as well as the influence of environmental factors \n\n(acid and alkaline pH) on the toxicity of the pesticide carbaryl in combination. The \n\ndescription of each chapter is summarized below: \n\n \n\nChapter 1: General Introduction. Contains a contextualization of the climate \n\nchange process and the consequences to aquatic environments.  \n\n \n\nChapter 2: Pesticide contamination in a changing environment: the role of pH, UV \n\nradiation and oxygen depletion in the modulation of toxicity. A careful and massive review \n\nof the literature was conducted concerning the climate change process and its consequent \n\nimpact on water quality through alterations in environmental factors and on pesticides fate \n\nand behaviour. Global warming, along with higher pesticide exposure in natural \n\necosystems may pose an increased risk in terms of quality of water resources and wildlife \n\nconservation. Climate change will produce changes in various abiotic parameters such as \n\npH, UV radiation and dissolved oxygen in which we focused in this review and in this \n\nthesis. The combination of these abiotic factors with pesticides may be deleterious to \n\naquatic species as they may interact in many ways producing higher toxicity and therefore \n\naffecting their development and long term survival.   \n\n \n\nChapter 3: Zebrafish embryo tolerance to environmental stress factors \u2013 \n\nconcentration/dose response analysis of oxygen limitation, pH and UV-light irradiation. In \n\nthis study we evaluated the tolerance of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos to variations in \n\nthree climate change related environmental stress parameters: pH, DO and UV light \n\nintensity. All stressors showed clear concentration- or intensity-dependent effects, on \n\nzebrafish embryo survival and development allowing the application of established models \n\nand determination of half-maximal effect concentrations (LC50, EC50). These data provide \n\nan important source to study the interaction of environmental stress factors with \n\ncontaminants in the zebrafish embryo model in the context of climate change scenarios. \n\n \n\nChapter 4: Effects of carbaryl in zebrafish embryos development, biochemical \n\nmakers and locomotion. In this work the acute toxicity of the carbamate insecticide \n\ncarbaryl was evaluated in zebrafish embryos using a battery of lethal and sub-lethal \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n20 \n \n\nendpoints. Embryos survival, development, biochemical markers and behaviour was \n\nstudied. Our results showed that carbaryl is moderately toxic to zebrafish embryos with a \n\n96 h-LC50 of 14.9 mg/L; however, low concentrations of carbaryl also demonstrated to \n\nimpact embryos development. At the sub-lethal level, carbaryl significantly decreased \n\nheart rate and body length and increased malformations (edemas, red blood cell clutch, \n\ndeformities such as axis curvature and tail deformity, etc.) and also resulted in significant \n\nalterations in enzymatic activities and behaviour. This study highlights the importance of \n\nconsidering the sub-lethal effects of environmental contaminants in risk assessment in \n\norder to better estimate their effects to aquatic biota.  \n\n \n\nChapter 5: Carbendazim exposure induced physiological, biochemical and \n\nbehaviour disturbance in zebrafish embryos. The toxicity of the benzimidazole fungicide \n\ncarbendazim was studied by performing a fish embryos toxicity test with zebrafish using \n\nseveral endpoints. The survival, development, biomarkers and behaviour of embryos was \n\naffected after exposure to carbendazim. The behaviour proved to be a very sensitive \n\nendpoint to evaluate the effects of pesticides to zebrafish embryos.  \n\nChapter 6: Influence of pH on the toxicity of carbaryl to zebrafish early life stages. \n\nIn this study, the combined effect of pH and carbaryl was studied. We analysed and \n\ncompared the predictive power of the concepts of concentration addition and independent \n\naction. Results show that observed mixture toxicity was rather well predicted by \n\nconcentration addition. In the case of acid range the median lethal concentration (LC50) of \n\nthe mixture is predicted with an error of only 8%. Considering the alkaline range, both \n\nconcepts underestimate the LC50 (by a factor of 3 for concentration addition and by a factor \n\nof 4.6 for independent action). The use of concentration addition to evaluate the combined \n\neffects of pH and chemical stress seems to be suitable at least for the case of carbaryl and \n\nacid conditions. In the case of alkaline level, high pH values played a crucial role by \n\nmodifying the toxicity of carbaryl through hydrolysis and consequently increasing its \n\ntoxicity to zebrafish embryos. More research need to be conducted to evaluate mixture \n\ntoxicity composed by chemical and non-chemical stressors in order to improve our \n\nunderstanding of these type of combinations and to improve the risk assessment of \n\nmixtures composed of chemical and non-chemical stressors.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n21 \n \n\nChapter 7: Discussion and Final Remarks.

With increasing anthropogenic pollution and rising temperatures, quality of \nwater ecosystems is becoming seriously compromised. Climate change will also induce \nproliferation of many invasive pests as conditions tend to be favourable to their life \ncycles. In this context, pesticide use will surely increase as a measure to safeguard crop \nproductivity. Global warming, along with higher pesticide exposure of natural \necosystems may pose and increase risk in terms of quality of water resources and wildlife \nconservation. Climate change will produce changes in various abiotic parameters such as \npH, ultraviolet radiation and dissolved oxygen in which we focus in this review paper. \nWe compiled data from 28 studies on the effects of the above mentioned environmental \nfactors on the toxicity of pesticides (insecticides, fungicides, herbicides etc.) to different \nmodel organisms. The evaluation revealed that in 71% cases the environmental factors \nsignificantly increased the toxicity of pesticides mainly by changing the bioavailability \nand consequently the uptake of the chemicals by the organisms. However, gaps \nconcerning the study of the effects of environmental parameters on the toxicity of \npesticides were also identified, especially concerning dissolved oxygen depletion with \nonly 3 studies available. This review highlights the need of further research in what \nconcerns pesticide toxicity in the climate change context in order to improve the risk \nassessment of these chemicals and adequately protect aquatic biota. Understanding the \nmechanisms underlying these effects is a pressing need and essential to build better \npredictive models and therefore implementing better policies for climate change \nmitigation.  \n\n \n\nKeywords: temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, UV radiation, pesticides, aquatic ecosystems \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPesticide contamination in a changing environment \n\n29 \n\n \n\n1. Introduction \n \n \n\nClimate change, particularly global warming is one of the major topics of concern \n\nworldwide and has been highlighted for its influence in natural and human systems. \n\nAssessment reports by the Intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC, 2013), \n\nindicate that global mean surface temperature has increased since the late 19th century \n\nfurther referring that the 2000\u2019s were the warmest among all the previous recorded. This \n\ntemperature change is expected to exceed 1.5\u00baC and the warming is likely to continue \n\nbeyond 2100 in almost all scenarios. Apart from the direct effect that temperature has on \n\norganisms, it can also impact water quality affecting physicochemical parameters such as \n\npH and dissolved oxygen (DO).  \n\nFreshwater ecosystems are naturally the most sensitive ecosystems due to changes \n\nin the hydrologic cycle promoted by climate change (Allan et al., 2005). Several natural \n\nsystems have been already described as impacted by recent climate change such as \n\ntemperate lakes (Ben\u00edtez-Gilabert et al., 2010; Fenoglio et al., 2010; Mooij et al., 2005), \n\ncatchments, streams and lakes. Analysis of extensive time sequences of these ecosystems \n\nhave shown that climate change affects water quality parameters such as nutrient loading \n\n(Ben\u00edtez-Gilabert et al., 2010; George et al., 2004; Komatsu et al., 2007), DO \n\nconcentrations (Mimikou et al., 2000; Prathumratana et al., 2008) and pH (Bates et al., \n\n2008; Vliet and Zwolsman, 2008). Furthermore, environmental parameters such as DO, \n\npH and conductivity have been shown to be negatively correlated with hydrological \n\nparameters such as the mean level and discharge flow which are certainly associated with \n\nclimatic processes (evaporation and precipitation).  \n\nA case-study in Spain, in a semi-arid stream, has shown a clear relationship \n\nbetween temperature increase and organic matter content and nutrient (nitrate and \n\nphosphorus) concentrations (Ben\u00edtez-Gilabert et al., 2010), being these important factors \n\nto consider when assessing the quality of water resources. Another case-study in the UK \n\nhighlighted that important hydrological changes will certainly occur, such as frequent \n\ndroughts in summer as well as flash flooding, leading to uncontrolled discharges from \n\nurban areas to water courses and estuaries (Whitehead et al., 2009). Also, other scenarios \n\npredict lower flows, reduced velocities and consequently higher water stagnation in rivers \n\nand lakes will enhance the potential for toxic algal blooms and DO depletion (Whitehead \n\n\n\nPesticide contamination in a changing environment \n\n30 \n\n \n\net al., 2009). \n\nBesides all these important effects referring to the direct physical alterations in \n\nwhat concerns climate change, other indirect effects are previewed that should not be \n\nneglected. Changes in climate are likely to result on spreading of some insect-borne \n\ndiseases and agricultural pests (Koleva and Schneider, 2009; Porter et al., 1991), in \n\naddition to the increased incidence of weeds (Coakley, 1999) caused mainly by \n\nalterations in temperature, precipitations and wind patterns. Several pests, diseases and \n\nweeds are already spreading or moving such as the Western corn rootworm, the Colorado \n\nbeetle in potato, grass weeds in maize and Barley Yellow Dwarf virus in cereals (Parry, \n\n1990). Thus, it is expected, in the future, an increase in pesticide use and therefore \n\nincreased bioavailability for non-target aquatic organisms. \n\n \n\n1.1 Effect of climate change related factors on pesticide toxicity \n\nRecently, special attention of the scientific community has been directed towards \n\nthe combined effects of multiple stressors instead of a only chemical toxicity evaluation, \n\nespecially considering the Global warming scenario. Standard chemical toxicity \n\nevaluation usually means exposing organisms in \u201cstandard conditions\u201d where \n\ntemperature, moisture, oxygen and pH are held constant and in controlled situations. \n\nHowever, these conditions do not always reflect the heterogeneity and the multiple stress \n\nfactors that natural populations experience in the wild but more importantly in the \n\nworldwide context, do not take into account the upcoming changes resulting from global \n\nalterations and do not lead into an accurate ecological risk assessment. \n\nSome recent reviews which focus on the influence of abiotic/environmental \n\nparameters - highlighted as impacted by climate change - in the biological effects of \n\ncontaminants such as Holmstrup et al., (2010) reporting interactions involving heat stress, \n\nfreezing temperatures, desiccation, oxygen depletion, starvation and pathogens and a \n\nhuge roll of chemicals including metals, pesticides and other types of chemicals such as \n\nammonia or phenol. Similarly,  Laskowski et al., (2010) emphasizes the need to \n\nincorporate natural environmental conditions, especially adjusted to different \n\ngeographical  areas, in ecological risk assessment. Further they refer that not only toxicity \n\nof single chemicals is affected but also that combinations of different chemicals may be \n\nmodulated by various environmental conditions. Therefore, a pressing need arise to \n\n\n\nPesticide contamination in a changing environment \n\n31 \n\n \n\ndesign new methodologies to improve ecological risk assessment and environmental \n\nsafety analysis. \n\nHowever, the mechanisms by which variations of environmental parameters \n\nincrease the toxicity of chemical pollutants, in freshwater systems, are not fully \n\nunderstood. These may act simply by inducting metabolic changes which can be a likely \n\nfactor for increased toxicity as referred many times in the literature (Heugens et al., 2001; \n\nHolmstrup et al., 2010; Lydy et al., 1999; Noyes et al., 2009) or can  interact chemically \n\nor biologically in more complex ways. Thus, scientific community is only starting to \n\nunderstand how multiple stressors such as salinity, temperature, hypoxia or Ultraviolet \n\nradiation (UVR) interact with chemical pollution and in which way are these affecting the \n\nbiota in all kinds of ecosystems (Schiedek et al., 2007).  \n\n \n\n1.2 Mixture toxicity \n\nIn what concerns aquatic toxicology, two different concepts are broadly used to \n\ndescribe general relationships between the effects of single substances and the \n\ncorresponding mixtures of stressors with similar and different modes of action (MoA) \n\ntherefore defined as concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA). These \n\nmodels allow the calculation of expected mixture\u2019s toxicity on the basis of known \n\ntoxicities of the mixture\u2019s individual components (Barata et al., 2007). \n\nThese concepts have now been applied to environmental factors as well being \n\nused in a similar way to evaluate existing interactions. However, these terms must be \n\nused with caution as environmental factors, contrary to chemical pollutants do not \n\npossess a specific MoA that can be used to integrate the stressor into IA or CA models. \n\nAlthough, these models have already been used to investigate such interactions, none of \n\nthe models obtained relates to biochemical and physiological processes which are the key \n\nto understanding those environmental-chemical interactions (Laskowski et al., 2010). \n\nTherefore, hereby, synergism or antagonism is referring to the degree by which the \n\neffects are either higher (synergism) or lower (antagonism) than the expected results in \n\nstandard situations.  \n\n\n\nPesticide contamination in a changing environment \n\n32 \n\n \n\nTaking into account all the information that was reported above, the main \n\nobjective of this review is to highlight the state of the art of current research on \n\ninteractions regarding environmental factors and pesticides and to identify data gaps that \n\nneed to be fulfilled The environmental parameters to be addressed in this review will be \n\nthe DO depletion, pH and UVR. Selection was made according to current state of the art \n\nand gaps in the literature concerning pesticides and climate change. \n\n \n\n2. Combined effects of environmental factors and pesticides \n2.1 Effect of acid and alkaline pH \n\n \n\nThe pH is pointed out as one of the most important factors conditioning survival \n\nand fitness of many freshwater species since it affects many chemical and biological \n\nprocesses. The pH of freshwater systems (rivers and lakes) depends on a complexity of \n\nfactors and can be indirectly affected by changes in climatic variables including higher \n\ntemperatures, increased summer drought, intense rainfall among others (Wright and \n\nJenkins, 2001; Wright and Schindler, 1995; Wright, 2008). For instance, a temperature \n\nincrease may be indirectly related to a pH increase reflecting a decrease in dissolved CO2 \n\nconcentrations due to proliferation of algae blooms as reported for European river \n\n(Meuse) after a severe drought period (van Vliet and Zwolsman, 2008). In remote \n\nlocations where acid deposition is absent such as alpine lakes (Psenner and Schmidt, \n\n1992; Sommaruga-W\u00f6grath et al., 1997) a strong positive correlation is observed between \n\npH and mean air temperature. In this case, factors such as a nitrogen deposition and/or \n\nbiological activity are indicated as possible significant variables for this variation. \n\nAs one of the most determinant parameter for any chemical and biochemical effect, \n\npH alone has been extensively explored in the past. Variations in pH showed to have a \n\nsignificant impact on survival, hatching success, reproduction, pigmentation, swimming \n\nperformance behavior and body chemistry of both fish species and invertebrate aquatic \n\nspecies (Fromm, 1980; Haines, 1981; Havas and Rosseland, 1995; Ikuta et al., 2000; \n\nJordahl and Benson, 1987; Lechleitner et al., 1985; Okland and Okland, 1986; Ye and \n\nRandall, 1991), with early life stages of development being more sensitive to pH \n\n\n\nPesticide contamination in a changing environment \n\n33 \n\n \n\nvariations. Effects of this environmental parameter are not restricted to the organismal \n\nlevel but also affect the community level, being responsible for changes in the structure \n\nof populations and for decreasing species diversity of aquatic organisms (Havas and \n\nRosseland, 1995; Jordahl and Benson, 1987; Okland and Okland, 1986). Therefore, in the \n\ncurrent and future climate change scenarios it is crucial to understand the consequences \n\nof this pH variations, especially in ecosystems where organisms are exposed to other \n\nchemical stressors being forced to cope simultaneously with multiple stress factors. \n\nThe majority of studies considering the influence of pH on the toxicity of \n\nenvironmental pollutants have focused on the effects of pH mainly on metals and phenols \n\ntoxicity (Bervoets and Blust, 2000; Dave, 1985; Dietrich and Schlatter, 1989; Grosell et \n\nal., 2006; Reader et al., 1989; Stouthart et al., 1996). Gerhardt (1993) reviewed the effects \n\nof pH on the toxicity of metals, concluding that metals toxicity depends on pH, because it \n\naffects sorption, complexation and solubility of metals. In general, it seems that decreases \n\nin pH implies increased metal uptake, consequently, increasing their toxicity. However, \n\nthe effects vary among species, life stage and duration of exposure. The influence of pH \n\non the toxicity of environmental pollutants has been studied for more than 50 years; \n\nnevertheless, few studies have dedicated to understand its influence on pesticides toxicity.  \n\nIn Table 1 we summarize 18 studies found in the literature addressing the effects \n\nof pH on the toxicity of pesticides. For almost all the pesticides, toxicity is correlated \n\nwith changes in pH. For organhosphates and carbamate pesticides, hydrolysis seems to be \n\nan important factor as decreases in toxicity were related to rapid hydrolysis of pesticides, \n\nespecially under alkaline conditions. However, the generation of more toxic hydrolysis \n\nproducts was correlated to an increase in the toxicity in higher pH values. In the specific \n\ncase of trichlorofon, its toxicity increases at higher pH values due to formation of a more \n\ntoxic form (Howe et al., 1994). Similarly, the herbicide mexacarbate zectran was found to \n\nbe 38 times more toxic at pH 9.5. In contrast two authors (Kar and Singh, 1978; Rath and \n\nAdhikary, 1996) reported a reduction in the toxicity of carbaryl and carbofuran (Furadan) \n\nto cyanobacteria and algae at high pH. In both cases, toxicity decreases as consequence of \n\na hydrolysis process, being these two more toxic at low pH (4.0-6.0). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPesticide contamination in a changing environment \n\n34

a changing environment \n\n37 \n\n \n\n \n\nRegarding pyrethroids, the pH effects on toxicity of these compounds were \n\ninvestigated in the three studies and no significant changes in the toxicity were found \n\n(Ghillebaert et al., 1996; Howe et al., 1994; Mauck et al., 1976). The greater molecular \n\nstability of these compounds across the studied pH range (6 to 9.5) may explain the \n\nlow or no influence of pH in the toxicity of this class/group of pesticides. However, \n\ntests under acidic conditions were absent in these studies.  \n\nThe toxicity of all the herbicides studied seem to be dependent on pH \n\nconditions except for the banned herbicide atrazine referred in Mayer et al., (1998). In \n\nthe extreme case of chlorsulfuron, toxicity is enhanced by 25-fold when pH is lowered \n\nfrom 6.0 to 5.0. In this particular case, a pH-dependent sorption and bioconcentration \n\nwas observed, suggesting that this herbicide primarily crosses the cell membrane in \n\nundissociated lipophilic form and accumulate inside the cell by ion trapping.   \n\nAs for the ubiquitous organochlorine herbicides 2,4 \u2013 dichlorophenol, 2,4,6 \u2013 \n\ntrichlorophenol and pentachlorophenol, four studies (Dave and Garside, 1980; Fisher, \n\n1991; Kishino and Kobayashi, 1995; Xing et al., 2012) account for a strong correlation \n\nbetween an increase in toxicity and low pH with severe effects on the survival and \n\ngrowth of the exposed organisms. On the other hand, the toxicity of the broad \n\nspectrum herbicide glyphosate increases only at higher pH values (7.5 \u2013 9.0) (Chen et \n\nal., 2004; Folmar et al., 1979) being this also observed by Tsui and Chu (2003) which \n\nreported a higher toxicity of this herbicide at high pH (9.0). Further, it was concluded \n\nthat glyphosate became non-ionic under alkaline pH resulting in a greater toxicity to \n\nthis species through a non-specific membrane disruption mechanism. \n\nAs can be seen from these studies, pH can strongly affect the toxicity of \n\npesticides. From the 18 studies reviewed, in the majority of cases (66%), it is reported \n\nan increase in the toxicity due to changes in pH. The influence of pH on the \n\nbioavailability and bioaccumulation of pesticides was the main explanation to the \n\nobserved effects at different pH levels mainly through transformation or degradation \n\noriginating more toxic metabolites (e.g. Mayer et al 1998; Tsui and Chu 2003; Howe, \n\nMarking et al 1994). In fact, it is well recognized that pH can act directly on the \n\nphysicochemical properties of chemical compounds leading to drastic changes in the \n\nbioavailability and also affecting the uptake by the organisms (Rendal et al., 2011a, \n\n2011b). Understanding the influence of pH on bioavailability, uptake and also on the \n\n\n\nPesticide contamination in a changing environment \n\n38 \n\n \n\nsensitivity of organisms is extremely important to understand the combined effects \n\nbetween pesticides and pH changes. The data sets available in the literature relating \n\npH to interactions with pesticides are very small comprising only 18 pesticides \n\nevaluated. In addition, half the studies investigate the pH effects only in the range of 6 \n\nto 9 which may not adequately reflect the actual toxicity of pesticides in cases in \n\nwhich pH falls outside the natural levels, such as acidic lakes (Psenner and Schmidt \n\n1992). Therefore, more research is needed to better predict the impact of fluctuations \n\nof pH on the toxicity of pesticides in order to protect aquatic biota in the current and \n\nfuture climate change scenarios.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2 Effect of low dissolved oxygen levels (DO)  \n\nNo environmental parameter of such ecological importance to coastal and \n\nestuarine environments has changed as fast as DO (Diaz, 2001). Hypoxia is defined by \n\nconcentrations of DO below 2 mg O2/L, (Diaz and Rosenberg, 1995; Shang and Wu, \n\n2004; Wu, 2002). Hypoxia has been referred as a problem regarding mainly marine \n\nenvironments affecting thousands of Km2 of marine water all over the world and has \n\nbeen responsible for mass mortality in various groups of organisms (Diaz, 2001). \n\nNotwithstanding, this phenomenon also occurs in a wide range of aquatic ecosystems \n\n(e.g. streams, lakes, etc.) and varies temporarily and seasonally depending on many \n\nfactors like atmospheric gas exchanges and temperature. While occurring naturally, \n\nhypoxia has been enhanced by anthropogenic activities related to organic and nutrient \n\nenrichment with special relevance on lakes and coastal areas which tend to be highly \n\nsensitive to nutrient enrichment  (Diaz and Breitburg, 2009) in a phenomenon known as \n\neutrophication.  \n\nDue to rapid human growth and global warming, the problem of hypoxia is \n\nlikely to worsen in the upcoming years. An increasing temperature will lead to a \n\nconsiderable reduction in oxygen solubility, therefore leading to a more anoxic \n\nenvironment. Hypoxia due to anthropogenic factors may be a result of excessive input \n\nof nutrients and organic matter into water bodies with poor water circulation. Singly, it \n\nis referred in Bagatto (2005) that hypoxia has profound effects on the onset of all \n\ncardiovascular responses but also shifted the onset relative to the developmental \n\n\n\nPesticide contamination in a changing environment \n\n39 \n\n \n\nprogramme. Hanazato &amp; Dodson (1995) refers that oxygen depletion may lead to lower \n\ngrowth rates in daphnids neonates due to an extra investment in haemoglobin \n\nproduction to compensate lower oxygen availability which will reduce energy needed to \n\ncarbaryl detoxification. In this case, a synergism occurred mainly by changing patterns \n\nof energy allocation.  \n\nSynergistic interactions between oxygen depletion and environmental \n\ncontaminants have already been reported, mainly focusing on heavy metals (e.g. Cd). \n\nVery few authors such as Ferreira et al. (2008),  Hanazato and Dodson (1995), Van der \n\nGeest (2002), studied interactions concerning pesticide toxicity and DO depletion \n\n(Table 2). Interaction between these two parameters may not always be of synergistic \n\nnature as influenced by the specific mode of action of each pesticide. While Ferreira et \n\nal. (2008) states that oxygen depletion and carbendazim interact synergistically, Van der \n\nGeest (2002) described that oxygen depletion had no effect on the toxicity of pesticide \n\ndiazinon. In another experiment, the synergism detected for low DO and high \n\ncarbendazim concentrations in daphnids was attributed to the production of reactive \n\noxygen species by hypoxic conditions and consequently a loss of detoxification \n\ncapability at the cellular levels (Ferreira et al., 2008). This synergism was further \n\nconfirmed by LC50 calculation at different DO levels.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPesticide contamination in a changing environment \n\n40 \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nTable 2 \u2013 Summary of studies concerning interactions between depletion of dissolved oxygen and pesticides \n\nPesticide Type/Chemical class Test organism Species Life stage Endpoint Interaction Reference \n\n        \n\nCarbendazim benzimidazole fungicide Daphnid \nDaphnia \nmagna Neonate Mortality Synergism (Ferreira et al. 2008) \n\nCarbendazim benzimidazole fungicide Daphnid \nDaphnia \nmagna \n\nFourth \ninstar Feeding rate Antagonism (Ferreira et al. 2008) \n\nCarbaryl Carbamate insecticide Daphnid Daphnia pulex All stages \nGrowth, reproduction, \n\ndevelopment Synergism \n(Hanazato and Dodson \n\n1995) \n\nDiazinon Carbamate insecticide Insect Ephoron virgo Larvae Mortality None \n(van der Geest et al \n\n2002) \n\n\n\nPesticide contamination in a changing environment \n\n41 \n\n \n\nDespite referring to possible hypothesis and mechanisms by which synergism \n\nmay occur, in none of this studies is taken a molecular approach in order to properly \n\nassess the nature of this synergism. Although one paradigm remains, the synergist ic \n\ninteractions resulting from lower oxygen concentrations should always be related, in \n\nsome sort of way, to the energy allocation which is used to acclimate and therefore not \n\navailable for detoxification of these contaminants. \n\nThe data available among the bibliography surely lacks for the combined effects \n\nof oxygen depletion and pesticides in vertebrate species as well as a convincing \n\nexplanation and description of the mechanisms involved in these synergistic \n\ninteractions. In this way, toxicodynamics and toxicokinetics studies should provide a \n\nbetter understanding on the effects of oxygen depletion in pesticide toxicity, particularly \n\nif these approaches are integrated into the respiratory chain and in antioxidant defence \n\nsuch as (e.g.) superoxide dismutase (SOD) or catalase (CAT) but also physiological \n\nindicators such as haemoglobin counts as referred by Hanazato &amp; Dodson (1995). \n\nHowever, it is noteworthy the lack of bibliography in this matter. \n\n \n\n2.3 Effect of UV radiation  \n\nIn the last years, there is a growing awareness on the effects of UVR in \n\nterrestrial ecosystems mainly due to an increasing concern related to human-induced \n\ndepletion of the stratospheric ozone layer. Despite the attention given and the efforts to \n\nmitigate this depletion, projections point out that baseline levels pre-1980 will not be \n\naccomplished in the next decades (Weatherhead and Andersen, 2006), however, the \n\nmost recent and promising report shows that ozone is no longer decreasing and is \n\nexpected to return to normal levels before the mid of the 21st century (WMO, 2011).  \n\nNevertheless, many other factors can cause alterations in UVR. Besides the \n\ndirect consequence of changes in the ozone layer, changes in aerosols, clouds, or surface \n\nreflectance may also affect UVR as reviewed by McKenzie and co-authors (McKenzie \n\net al., 2011). However, future projections on UVR changes are uncertain due to the \n\ncomplexity in the projection of clouds and aerosol changes and also due to the complex \n\ninteraction between climate change and ozone depletion (McKenzie et al., 2011).  Other \n\nimportant variable conditioning UVR effects in natural waters is the dissolved organic \n\nmatter (DOM), which has a strong effect on the attenuation of UV-B radiation in \n\n\n\nPesticide contamination in a changing environment \n\n42 \n\n \n\naquatic environments (Helbling and Zagarese, 2003). Changes in quantity and quality of \n\nDOM directly influence the exposure of aquatic organisms to UV-B radiation (Clements \n\net al., 2008). Moreover, climate change may affect the production, transport and cycling \n\nof DOM leading, in some scenarios, to its reduction in aquatic ecosystems (Young et \n\nal., 2005, 2004). These changes in the amount of DOM, accompanied by increasing UV \n\nradiation, may exacerbate UV effects to aquatic biota.  \n\nUltraviolet (UV) is the shortest wavelength (100-400 nm) that reaches the \n\nsurface of earth and is divided into three wavelength bands: UV-A (315-400 nm), UV-B \n\n(280-315 nm) and UV-C (100-280nm) (Helbling and Zagarese, 2003; WHO, 2002; \n\nWMO, 2011). Furthermore, the amount of UV radiation reaching the earth\u2019s surface is \n\nmainly composed of UV-A and a small quantity of UV-B as UV-C radiation is almost \n\nall absorbed by stratospheric ozone. As almost no UV-C reaches the earth surface, UV-\n\nB remains as the most hazardous to organisms (H\u00e4der, 2000; Preston et al., 1999; \n\nWilliamson et al., 2001).  \n\nRecently, the direct and indirect effects of UV-B radiation in aquatic ecosystems \n\nhave received attention. Studies confirmed that solar UV-B radiation have harmful \n\neffects on aquatic organisms (H\u00e4der et al., 2007; Helbling and Zagarese, 2003). UV-B \n\nradiation demonstrated to inhibit photosynthesis  (Bracher and Wiencke, 2000), to cause \n\nDNA damage (Zeng et al., 2009), to alter behavior (Blaustein et al., 2000), growth and \n\nreproduction (Huovinen et al., 2001a), to reduce body size and hatching success \n\n(Dethlefsen et al., 2001) and increase deformities and mortality (Blaustein et al., 1997, \n\n2003).  \n\nNonetheless, it is important to note that there is high inter-specific variability \n\nregarding the sensitivity to UV-B radiation and thus, some species are not so susceptible \n\n(H\u00e4kkinen et al., 2002; Oromi et al., 2008). These aspects may pose difficulties to \n\nassess the UV effects in natural waters (H\u00e4der et al., 2007). Furthermore, the co-\n\nexposure of organisms to UV radiation and a variety of environmental pollutants may \n\ninduce interactive effects (antagonistic or synergistic). \n\nUV-B radiation has been reported  to modify the toxicity of many stressors, such \n\nas metals (Prasad and Zeeshan, 2005; Preston et al., 1999; Rai et al., 1998), polycyclic \n\naromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Huovinen et al., 2001b; Nikkil\u00e4 et al., 1999), \n\nantibiotics (J. Kim et al., 2009; J.-W. Kim et al., 2009) among others. Arfsten et al., \n\n(1996) reviewing the effects of UVR on the toxic effects of PAHs in aquatic organisms \n\n\n\nPesticide contamination in a changing environment \n\n43 \n\n \n\nfound that apparently the UV seems to increase PAHs toxicity. According to their \n\nresults, exposure to UVR and PAH in concert induced a lethal phototoxic effect, where \n\nlethality may be a result of a rapid accumulation of cellular damage or death in higher \n\naquatic organisms. Moreover, they found evidences that PAHs enhance carcinogenic \n\nproperties of UV light. Another study investigating the effects of combined UVR and \n\ntoxic chemicals associated changes on amphibian populations to synergistic interactions \n\nof UVR and contaminants (Blaustein et al., 2003). Although, a large amount of studies \n\nhave tried to address interaction between environmental pollutants (mainly metals and \n\nPAHs) and UV-B radiation, few research have focused on the determination of \n\ninteraction between UV-B radiation and the fate and effects of pesticides and the few \n\nstudies addressing this issue are quite recent, dating from 1998 (14 years ago).  Table 3 \n\nsummarizes all the studies conducted on interactions effects of UV-B and pesticides on \n\naquatic organisms. In the majority of studies explicit synergistic effects were found. \n\nNevertheless, the mechanisms through how UV-B radiation enhances the toxicity of \n\npesticides are heterogeneous and in some cases not clear. \n\nThree studies assessed the combined effects of UV-B and insecticides. Beketov \n\net al., (2011) investigated the UV-B related toxicity of pesticides fenoxycarb, pirimicarb \n\nand tebufenpyrad on the survival, reproduction and population growth rate of daphnids. \n\nThe combination of sublethal pesticides concentrations and UV doses produced a \n\nsynergistic effect on both cumulative reproduction and population growth rate for \n\nfenoxycarb and pirimicarb, but a less-than-additive effect for tebufenpyrad. The authors \n\nstated two different processes that may explain the observed synergistic effects: (1) UV \n\nradiation possibly activates the compounds inside the tested organisms after exposure to \n\nchemicals, or (2) sensitivity of tested organisms is probably increased by UV radiation. \n\nThey concluded that the synergistic effects are mainly due to the combined effects of \n\nboth stressors (pesticides and UV) on daphnid physiology.\n\n\n\nPesticide contamination in a changing environment \n\n44 \n\n \n\nTable 3 \u2013 Summary of studies concerning interactions between UV and pesticides \n\nPesticide Type/Chemical class \nTest \n\norganism Species Life stage Endpoint Interaction Reference \n\nCarbaryl Insecticide Carbamate Amphibian \nRana \n\nsphenocephala Tadpoles Survival/Body length None \n(Bridges and \nBoone 2003) \n\nCarbaryl Insecticide Carbamate Amphibian Hyla versicolor Embryos/Tadpoles Survival/Locomotory activity Synergism \n(Zaga et al., \n\n1998) \n\nCarbaryl Insecticide Carbamate Frog Xenopus laevis Embryos/Tadpoles Survival/Locomotory activity Synergism \n(Zaga et al., \n\n1998) \n\nFenoxycarb Insecticide Carbamate Waterflea Daphnia magna Adults \nReproduction/Population \n\ngrowth rate Synergism \n(Beketov et al., \n\n2011) \n\nPirimicarb Insecticide Carbamate Waterflea Daphnia magna Adults \nReproduction/Population \n\ngrowth rate Synergism \n(Beketov et al., \n\n2011) \n\nTebufenpyrad Insecticide Pyrazole Waterflea Daphnia magna Adults \nReproduction/Population \n\ngrowth rate Synergism \n(Beketov et al., \n\n2011) \n\nCarbendazim Fungicide Benzimidazole Waterflea Daphnia magna Adults/Neonates Reproduction/feed inhibition \nSynergism \n\n/Antagonism \n(Ribeiro et al., \n\n2011) \n\nAcifluorfen Herbicide (diphenyl ether) Waterflea Daphnia magna Adults \nLocomotory \n\nActivity/Immobilization Synergism \n(Scrano et al., \n\n2002) \n\nTriazine Herbicide Triazine Alga \nScenedesmus \n\ngutwinskii - Photosynthetic rate Synergism \n(Kasai and Arts, \n\n1997) \n\nAtrazine Herbicide Triazine Bacterium Vibrio fischeri - Bioluminescence Antagonism (Lin et al., 1999) \n\nMetolachlor Herbicide Chloroacetanilide Bacterium Vibrio fischeri - Bioluminescence Antagonism (Lin et al., 1999) \n\n\n\nPesticide contamination in a changing environment \n\n45 \n\n \n\nThe other two studies investigate the effects of UV-B radiation on the toxicity of \n\nthe well-known carbamate pesticide carbaryl. Both studies evaluated the lethal and \n\nsublethal effects of the combination on amphibians. Bridges and Boone (2003) found no \n\neffect of UV radiation on carbaryl toxicity. The authors believe that dissolved organic \n\ncarbon of the artificial ponds used in the test might have act as a protection. On the \n\nother hand, Zaga et al. (1998) results indicated a synergistic effect due to \n\nphotoenhanced toxicity by UV-B radiation. In this case, the synergism seems to arise \n\nfrom the photomodification of the carbaryl molecule in the water.  \n\nOne study investigated the interactive effects of environmental relevant UV \n\ndoses (105 to 400 J.m-2) on the toxicity of carbendazim (a benzimidazole fungicide) to \n\nDaphnia magna. Ribeiro et al., (2011) found two different response patterns for feeding \n\nrates and reproduction. For feeding inhibition, when UVR was the dominant stressor in \n\nthe combination, antagonism was observed. Conversely, for reproduction, synergism \n\nwas observed when UVR was the dominant stressor in the combination. In these case \n\nthe response patterns differs according to the endpoint and UVR dose applied. \n\nDifferently from the others studies, these authors do not associate the increased toxicity \n\nto photomodification/phototransformation of the pesticide.   \n\nThe other three studies explored the UV-B influence on herbicides toxicity. \n\nKasai and Arts (1997) and Scrano et al., (2002) observed a negative effect of UV-B \n\nradiation on triazine and acifluorfen to algae and  daphnids respectively. On the other \n\nhand, Lin et al., (1999) studying the effect of simulated sunlight on atrazine and \n\nmetolachlor toxicity to aquatic organisms observed a decrease in toxicity when \n\nincreasing light intensity. The authors suggested a possible photodegradation of the \n\npesticides when exposed to simulated sunlight as the responsible for the reduction in the \n\ntoxicity. \n\nBased on the knowledge obtained until now, the combination of UV radiation \n\nand pesticides seems to depend on the specific compound and its concentrations and \n\nalso on the species and stage of development. However, further studies need to be \n\nconducted to comprehend how these stressors interact with one another and the possible \n\nmechanisms behind these interactions in order to predict the consequence of the \n\nincreasing UV radiation. The synergistic effects should be thoroughly investigated to \n\nbetter define more realistic safe concentrations of pesticides. Furthermore, to realistic \n\npredict the consequences of increasing UV-B radiation and pesticides pollution under \n\n\n\nPesticide contamination in a changing environment \n\n46 \n\n \n\nthe climate change conditions, it is of extremely and crucial importance to increase the \n\nknowledge on combined effects of these stressors. \n\n \n\n3. Conclusion and future remarks \n\nAccording to the literature reviewed, it is clear that climate change will have a \n\nwide range of effects not only on structure and function of freshwater ecosystems, but \n\nalso on pesticide distribution and toxicity. From the 28 studies reviewed on interactive \n\neffects of pesticides and environmental factors showed that in the majority of cases \n\n(78%), environmental variables significantly modified the toxicity of pesticides on \n\ntested organisms. Although many studies refer the potential impact of environmental \n\nvariables in pesticide toxicity such as pH, a lack of knowledge is still present when we \n\naddress to the nature of this interactions. The terms synergism and antagonism still need \n\nto be clearly defined in what concern this relations. These terms do not imply that a \n\ndirect effect is experienced due to interactions at the physiological level or the possible \n\n\u201cside effects\u201d that a given environmental parameter may induce. Also, it is clear that a \n\ntemporal gap (from 2000 until now only 4 studies available) exists for certain \n\nparameters such as the verified in pH while there is a clear gap of knowledge \n\nconcerning depletion of dissolved oxygen and the effects of UV radiation. Moreover, in \n\nthe case of pH, the majority of studies evaluate its effects in the range between 6 and 9 \n\nwhich do not reflect their real toxicity. Climate change is a much more complex \n\nproblem than what is addressed in individual research on sole environmental parameters \n\nand pesticides and therefore we need to keep in mind that in natural environmental \n\nconditions interactions of more than one parameter and more than one toxicant may \n\noccur. Although this review highlights the need of further research in what concerns \n\npesticide toxicity in the climate change context, it also points out the need to conduct \n\nintegrated studies in which data should include site specific conditions for better \n\necological risk assessment. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these effects is a \n\npressing need and essential to build better predictive models and therefore \n\nimplementing better policies for climate change mitigation. We hope that this review \n\nmay inspire future studies in this matter, not only referring to effects of the interactions \n\nbetween environmental parameters and pesticide toxicity but also to the complexity of \n\nthe questions underlined here and hopefully leading to creation of better tools for \n\n\n\nPesticide contamination in a changing environment \n\n47 \n\n \n\necological risk assessment and mitigation policies.  \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nAuthors acknowledge Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia (FCT \u2013 Portugal) by the \n\nfinancial support through the grants attributed to Thayres Andrade \n\nSFRH/BD/74501/2010 and In\u00eas Domingues SFRH/BD/74501/2010 and the National \n\nfunding through FCT, within the research project Climatox \u2013 Impact of climatic \n\nchanges on toxicity of pollutants (Ref.

Changes in these parameters could modify the toxicity of environmental \npollutants. Therefore, in this study, we studied the tolerance of zebrafish (Danio rerio) \nembryos to variations in pH (3 - 12), dissolved oxygen (3.9 \u2013 237 \u00b5mol/L) and UV \nintensity (55 \u2013 467 mW/m2) using selected endpoints. The zebrafish embryo is an \nestablished alternative test system that is widely used for assessment of the toxicity of \nchemicals. Embryos were exposed to different ranges of the sublethal endpoints, \nassessment included the quantification of hatching success, developmental delay, reduction \nof body length, and frequency of edema, and morphological abnormalities. 96 h-LC50s of \n3.68 and 10.21 were determined for acid and alkaline pH, respectively. Embryo survival \nappeared to be relatively resistant to oxygen depletion with a 96 h-LC50 of 13.17 \u00b5mol/L. \nHowever, concentrations of 187 mg/L and below caused edema and developmental \nretardations. Continuous exposure to UV radiation (UVR) affected zebrafish development \nby reducing survival and hatching rate and triggering a series of developmental \nabnormalities such as pericardial edema and deformities. A 72 h-LC50 of 227 mW/m2 was \nderived from intensity-response modelling. Our data provide a useful basis for the \nsubsequent assessment of combined effect of environmental stress parameters and \nchemicals in the context of climate change scenario using the zebrafish embryo model.  \n \nKey words: Danio rerio, global changes, embryo development, abiotic factors, co-stress \n \n\n \n1. Introduction \n\nRecent reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2013) \n\nhave indicated that the global mean surface temperature has increased since the late 19th \n\ncentury with a tendency to exceed a further 1.5\u00ba C increase until 2100 in almost all \n\n\n\nZebrafish embryos tolerance to environmental stress factors \n\n61 \n \n\nscenarios. Temperature does not only have a direct effect on organism but is impacting \n\nalso on water physicochemical parameters such as dissolved oxygen (DO) level and pH \n\nwhich could affect the toxicity of contaminants to aquatic organism. Indirectly, \n\ntemperature may also change exposure of organism to UV light. \n\nFor instance, increasing temperatures and increased summer droughts are likely to \n\nfavour acidic conditions in surface waters (Wright, 2008) due to a higher production of \n\ncarbon dioxide. pH has been shown to affect survival rates, hatching success, reproduction, \n\npigmentation, swimming performance behaviour and body chemistry of both fish species \n\nand invertebrate aquatic species (Fromm, 1980; Havas and Rosseland, 1995; Jordahl and \n\nBenson, 1987; Lechleitner et al., 1985; Okland and Okland, 1986; Ye and Randall, 1991), \n\nwith early life stages of development being more sensitive to pH variations. Consequently, \n\nchanges in the pH may also affect the community level and translate into via alterations in \n\npopulation structure and reduced species diversity. In acidic streams (pH of about 5), \n\nsublethal effects such as reduced larval activity and pigmentation, incomplete hatching as \n\nwell as low survival of embryos could explain low population density and altered \n\npopulations structure as observed e.g. in Salvelinus fontinalis brook trout populations \n\n(Jordahl and Benson, 1987). Eventually, low pH levels can constitute a risk for more \n\nsensitive fish and invertebrate species through effects on survival and development of \n\nembryos and larval stages. Moreover, an influence of pH on pesticides toxicity has been \n\ndocumented in various studies (Chen et al., 2004; Fisher, 1991; Folmar et al., 1979; Mount, \n\n1973). Overall, these studies showed that fluctuations in pH exacerbate the toxicity of \n\npesticides which may be attributed to increased bioavailability as has been shown for e.g. \n\naluminium and other metals (Dietrich and Schlatter, 1989).  \n\nIncreasing temperature is also expected to decrease saturation concentrations of \n\noxygen due to a decrease in water capacity to carry oxygen.  In aquatic ecosystems with \n\nfluctuating oxygen levels as common for many lakes or streams, the dissolved oxygen \n\ndepletion could increase the frequency of hypoxia status. Hypoxia is commonly defined as \n\nan oxygen concentration below 2 mg/L in aquatic environments. Anthropogenic activities \n\nleading to organic and nutrient enrichment may contribute further to amplify this effect by \n\neutrophication.  \n\nReduced spawning success, sperm motility, fertilization success, hatching rate and \n\nlarval survival have been described as hypoxia effect on wild fish populations and to \n\n\n\nZebrafish embryos tolerance to environmental stress factors \n\n62 \n \n\nreduce reproductive performance (Wu et a. 2003). At the community level, hypoxia does \n\nnot only change the structure by loss of species diversity in fish and benthic communities \n\n(Dauer et al., 1993; Diaz and Rosenberg, 1995) but also change functional groups and \n\ntypes of animal/plants in benthic, fish and planktonic communities. Given that many \n\nchemicals are known to interfere with reproductive success and development, combination \n\neffects with oxygen depletion could be anticipated. For instance, synergistic effects on \n\nsurvival and growth resulting from the interaction between low oxygen levels and \n\npesticides were described by Ferreira et al. (2008) and Hanazato et al. (1995) in daphnids. \n\nDecrease in oxygen concentrations has also shown to affect the toxicity of phenolic \n\ncompounds to fresh water fish Nopterus nopterus (Gupta et al., 1983).  \n\nPenetration depth of UV light can range from 0.5 to 4 m. Hence, UV-light is \n\npotentially damaging to species living in this zone (Speekmann, 2000). Projections show \n\nthat despite the efforts to reduce atmospheric ozone depletion, the baseline levels of UVR \n\nbefore 1980 will not be restored in the next decades (Weatherhead and Andersen, 2006). \n\nMoreover, the UV exposure of inland aquatic ecosystems remains highly variable and \n\ncould increase due to climate changes. For instance, alterations in dissolved organic carbon \n\n(DOC) could affect the UVR transparency since drier and warmer climates will reduce \n\nflooding and water saturation of soils within watersheds and hence, could reduce the entry \n\nof DOC to adjacent lakes and streams. This might increase exposure of aquatic species to \n\nUVR and affect distribution and abundance of planktonic and shallow benthic organisms \n\nas well as the benthic spawning zones of vertebrates such as amphibians and fish that \n\ndeposit their eggs in shallow surface waters (H\u00e4der et al., 2007). \n\nUVR is defined as the shortest wavelength that reaches the surface of the earth \n\nbeing divided into UV-A (315-400 nm), UV-B (280-315 nm) and UV-C (100-280 nm) \n\n(Helbling and Zagarese, 2003; WHO, 2002; WMO, 2011). The UVR reaching the earth\u2019s \n\nsurface is mainly composed of UV-A and a small quantity of UV-B while UV-C is almost \n\ncompletely absorbed by the stratospheric ozone. UVR is known to provoke several \n\ndeleterious effects in fish such as DNA damage (Zeng et al., 2009) and reduction of \n\nhatching success and egg survival rates (Charron et al., 2000). Moreover, UV has shown to \n\nmodify the toxicity of many chemical stressors such as metals (Preston et al., 1999), \n\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) (Huovinen et al., 2001; Nikkil\u00e4 et al., 1999) and \n\npesticides (Ribeiro et al., 2011; Zaga et al., 1998) with \u2013 in the majority of studies \u2013 \n\n\n\nZebrafish embryos tolerance to environmental stress factors \n\n63 \n \n\nincreasing toxicity of contaminants which may result in synergistic (i.e. higher than \n\nexpected from the individual toxicity) effects. \n\nIn the context of global change, understanding how the above mentioned \n\ncomponents can affect toxicity of environmental contaminants to aquatic organisms is \n\npertinent. Therefore, this study intended to evaluate the effects of different ranges of pH, \n\nDO and UVR (280-400 nm) on zebrafish embryos, an important model for the hazard \n\nassessment of chemicals. The zebrafish embryo test is considered as an alternative model \n\nto toxicity tests with juvenile or adult fish. It offers the possibility to perform small-scale, \n\nhigh-throughput analyses compliant with the 3Rs approach (refinement, replacement and \n\nreduction of animal experiments; Embry et al., 2010; Halder, 2001; Str\u00e4hle et al., 2012). \n\nThe transparent embryos and its well characterized embryonic development represent \n\nfurther advantages of the model in toxicity assessment (Kimmel et al., 1995). Therefore, \n\nwe set out to provide a detailed and comprehensive assessment of susceptibility ranges for \n\npH, DO and UVR as a basis for the future assessment of the impact of stress factors related \n\nto climate change on chemical toxicity.  \n\n \n\n2. Material and Methods \n\n2.1 Test organisms \n\nZebrafish were kept in a ZebTEC (Tecniplast, Buguggiate, Italy) recirculating \n\nsystem. Culture water was obtained through reverse osmosis and activated carbon filtration \n\nof tap water, complemented with 0.34 mg/L salt (\u201cInstant Ocean Synthetic Sea Salt\u201d, \n\nSpectrum Brands, USA) and automatically adjusted for pH and conductivity. Water \n\ntemperature was 26.0 \u00b1 1 \u00baC, conductivity 750 \u00b1 50 \u00b5S, pH 7.5 \u00b1 0.5 and dissolved oxygen \n\nequal or above 95 % (7.6 mg/L) saturation. A 16:8 h (light:dark) photoperiod cycle was \n\nmaintained. The adult fish were fed twice a day with commercially available artificial diet \n\n(ZM-400 fish food; Zebrafish Management Ltd) and brine shrimp. Eggs were obtained by \n\nbreeding of fish in aquaria with marbles in the bottom to protect eggs from predation by \n\nadults. The day prior to breeding, males and females were separated by placing a barrier in \n\nthe holding container until the next morning. Early in the morning, barriers were removed. \n\nAfter removal of marbles eggs were collected, rinsed in water and checked under a \n\n\n\nZebrafish embryos tolerance to environmental stress factors \n\n64 \n \n\nstereomicroscope (Stereoscopic Zoom Microscope-SMZ 1500, Nikon Corporation). Eggs \n\nwith cleavage irregularities, injuries or other kind of malformations were discarded.  \n\nAll tests were performed similar as described in the OECD testing guideline 236 \n\n(OECD, 2013), in charcoal filtered and deionised water supplemented with 0.34 mg/L  sea \n\nsalt (see above) at 26 \u00b1 1 \u00baC and a 16:8 h (light:dark) photoperiod (except UV test, see \n\nbelow).  Exposure was conducted from 3 to 96 hpf. \n\n \n\n2.2 Analysis of pH effects \n\nZebrafish embryos were exposed to pH ranges from 3.0 to 12. A set of buffers were \n\nused in order to prevent pH drifts during the assay (Table 1). All buffers (MES, MOPS, \n\nTRIS, CHES and CAPS) were first tested at neutral pH. The neutral pH is outside of the \n\noptimal buffer range but was only used to estimate any potential toxic effect to zebrafish \n\nembryos (Fig S1 and S2 suppl. Data (\u2018S\u2019 before the number indicates that the figure or \n\ntable respectively is provided in the \u2018supplementary information\u2019)). This analysis indicated \n\nthat buffers were used at concentrations ranging from 17- to 64-fold below concentrations \n\nthat cause mortality. Except for MES, all buffers were used in their optimal pH range to \n\ntest for pH toxicity. However, despite that MES was used outside the optimal range it was \n\nfound to efficiently maintain the pH (Figure S3) and was not toxic to embryos at the used \n\nconcentration. HCl and NaOH (1.0 N) solutions were used for pH adjustment; a portable \n\nmultiparameter device (ProfiLine Multi 332) was used for pH measurements. Test \n\nsolutions were daily renewed.  \n\nEmbryos were exposed individually in 24-well plates for 96 h. For each test 10 \n\nembryos were used per replicate and a minimum of 3 replicates were used per treatment. \n\nThe following endpoints were registered: survival, incidence of pericardial edema, heart \n\nrate, deformities, hatching success, body length and developmental delay. The heart rate \n\nwas measured by counting heart beats under a stereomicroscope in 3 randomly selected 48 \n\nhpf-embryos of each replicate (n=9 per concentration) over a period of 15 s. Body length \n\nwas measured by analysis of digital images of the embryos using the software NIS \n\nElements D (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) in 96 hpf-old embryos. Developmental \n\ndelay was determined by comparison of controls and exposed embryos with developmental \n\nstages as described by Kimmel et al. (1995) and by calculating the difference between the \n\n\n\nZebrafish embryos tolerance to environmental stress factors \n\n65 \n \n\nstages in comparison to normal development (in hours). A correction accounting for the \n\ndifferent temperatures used in Kimmels\u2019 work and the present work was done using the \n\nformula HT=h/ (0.055 T-0.57) described in Kimmel et al. (1995) with HT= hours of \n\ndevelopment at temperature T, and h = hours of development to reach the stage at 28.5. \n\n  \nTable 1 \u2013 Buffers used for pH stabilization: concentrations used, respective pH range and toxicity \ndata. \n\nBuffer Concentration \nused in test (mM) \n\npH \nrange \n\nNOEC LC50 \n\nNo buffer  # - 3.0-3.5 - - \nMES- 2-(Morpholinoethanesulfonic) \nacid monohydrate \n\n4 3.7-6.5 256 mM* n.d. \n\nMOPS- 3-(N-\nMorpholino)propanesulfonic acid \n\n4 6.9-7.5 256 mM* n.d. \n\nTRIS- 2-Amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-\n1,3-propanediol \n\n4 8.0-8.5 256 mM* n.d. \n\nCHES- 2-\n(Cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid \n\n22 9.0-9.5  396 \nmM \n\nCAPS-3-(Cyclohexylamino)-1-\npropanesulfonic acid \n\n22 10-12  380.7 \nmM \n\nn.d. not determined due to low mortality rates at concentration up to the limit of solubility. \n* Highest tested concentration \n# pH levels at this range could be maintained stable without a buffer \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3 Analysis of oxygen depletion \n\nEmbryos were exposed to oxygen concentrations ranging from 3.9 and 237 \u00b5mol/L \n\n(0.12 to 7.6 mg/L), reflecting an oxygen spectrum from hypoxic to normoxic conditions. \n\nThe different oxygen concentrations were established by injecting compressed gaseous \n\nnitrogen to the exposure medium. This was done inside a controlled atmosphere chamber \n\n(model 855-AC, PlasLabs, USA), saturated with nitrogen gas in order to facilitate the \n\nestablishment of the desired oxygen concentration in each bottle. Subsequently the test \n\nvessels with the embryos were transferred to an incubator with controlled temperature. \n\nOxygen concentrations, pH and conductivity were measured using a portable \n\nmultiparameter device immediately after adding the embryos and at the end of the test. \n\nEmbryo exposure was performed with 10 embryos in 100 ml air-tight glass Schott bottles \n\ncompletely filled with test solution to avoid gas exchange during the assay. A minimum of \n\n\n\nZebrafish embryos tolerance to environmental stress factors \n\n66 \n \n\nnine replicates per treatment were used.. At the beginning of the test, the pH values varied \n\namong the different DO treatments between 7.6 and 8.4. Given that the results from pH \n\nexperiments demonstrated that pH effects were only observed at various levels above or \n\nbelow neutral conditions, the pH was not adjusted. (see section 3.1: pH effects on zebrafish \n\nembryo survival and development).   \n\nTo avoid variation in the DO concentrations, flasks were not opened until \n\nmeasurement. Hence, separate replicates were used to analyse oxygen concentrations at 24, \n\n48 or 96 hpf. Embryos were then visually inspected using a stereo microscope. Survival \n\nrate, hatching success, frequency of edema, heart rate, developmental delay and body \n\nlength were recorded.  \n\n \n\n2.4 Analysis of UV effects \n\nZebrafish embryos were continuously exposed to the UVR intensities ranging from \n\n55 \u00b1 3.3 to 467 \u00b1 25.7 mW/m2 for a 96 h period with no other source of light. A \n\ncontinuous exposure was chosen to allow the modeling of data and the derivation of \n\nL(E)C50 values on continuous exposure basis for future experiment on the combined \n\neffects of UV and chemical exposure. Additionally, a normal light control (16:8 h, light: \n\ndark; ?500 lux) and three continuous light controls (3.2 \u00b1 0.83 lux to resemble intensity \n\nunder UVR exposure, 539 \u00b1 7.63 lux, similar to the normal light control and 1804 \u00b1 13.11 \n\nlux for comparison with previously published literature) were conducted in order to \n\nindicate whether the differential photoperiod alone may impact on the development and \n\nsurvival of the embryos. Organisms were placed in plastic petri dishes.  Acetate cellulose \n\nfilters (0.003 mm, Grafix plastics, USA) were used to reduce UVR irradiation and placed \n\ndirectly below the UV lamps and over the Petri dishes (were they also avoided medium \n\nevaporation). These filters were previously irradiated for 12 h to achieve stable reductions \n\nin UV transmission and to filter UV-C wavelengths (200-280 nm). In order to achieve \n\ndifferent UVR intensities, the organisms were placed at different distances from two \n\nSpectroline XX15F/B lamps (Spectronics Corporation, NY, USA). Lamps had peak \n\nemission at 313 nm and 365 nm corresponding to UV-B and UV-A respective emission \n\npeaks, see Fig S4 supplementary data.  \n\n\n\nZebrafish embryos tolerance to environmental stress factors \n\n67 \n \n\nUVR intensities (280 \u2013 400 nm) were measured every 24 h with a spectro-\n\nradiometer connected to a monochromator and analyzed with BenWin+ Software \n\n(Bentham Instruments, Reading, UK).  Lethal and sublethal effects such as described in \n\nsection 2.2 were monitored daily. \n\n \n\n2.4. Data analysis \n\nLethal concentration values (LC10 and LC50) and effect concentration (EC10 and \n\nEC50) were calculated for each environmental parameter by fitting logistic dose-response \n\ncurves  using the package drc (Ritz and Streibig, 2005) in the software R (R Core Team, \n\n2014). Model choice decision was made based on the the R2, the log likelihood value, \n\nAkaike's information criterion (AIC) and the estimated residual standard error. The models \n\nused as well as the slopes for each concentration response curve are presented in Table S1 \n\nin the supplementary information. \n\nBuffer LC50s could only be calculated for CAPS and CHES. For all other buffers \n\ntested the low mortality rates up to concentrations at the solubility limit did not allow \n\nobtaining LC50 values. For these buffers an ANOVA (one-way analysis of variance) with \n\nappropriate post hoc test (- Dunnett\u2019s or Dunn\u2019s test) were conducted to potentially derive \n\nLOEC or NOEC values. The type of ANOVA (parametric or non-parametric) and post hoc \n\ntest was chosen depending on whether normality and homocedasticity of data were \n\ndemonstrated by analysis of the residuals with the Shapiro-Wilks test. Test statistics and \n\nanalysis of normality were conducted using the software SigmaPlot V.11.0 (Systat \n\nSoftware, 2008) and a significance level of 0.05. \n\n \n\n 3. Results \n\n3.1 pH effects on zebrafish embryo survival and development \n\nThe pH effects were tested for both acidic and alkaline conditions (pH 3-7 and pH \n\n7-12) using various buffers well below lethal concentration ranges (Fig. S1 and S2, \n\nsupplementary data) to stabilize the pH. Embryos exposed to pH below 3.5 or above 10.5 \n\nshowed a 100 % of mortality. The observed lethality was established within 24 hours and \n\n\n\nZebrafish embryos tolerance to environmental stress factors \n\n68 \n \n\ndid not increase with prolonged exposure. A 96 h-LC50 value of 3.7 \u00b1 0.03 pH units was \n\ndetermined (Table 2 and 3 and Fig. 1 a). Heart rate was affected (bradycardia) at 48 h and \n\npericardial edema increased frequency was observed at 96 h (Table 2 and 3, Fig 2 b, Fig. \n\nS5 a and b). For the alkaline range, a 96 h-LC50 of 10.2 \u00b1 0.03 pH units was calculated \n\n(Table 2 and 3, Fig. 1 b). Alkaline pH also affected hatching success at 72 hpf (Fig. S6 a) \n\nand the incidence of pericardial edemas (Fig. S6 b).  \n\n \n\n3.2 Oxygen depletion effects on zebrafish embryo survival and development  \n\nThe effects of oxygen depletion were studied on the survival and development of \n\nzebrafish embryos exposed to DO in the range of  3.9 to 237 \u00b5mol/L. At 24 h no mortality \n\nwas observed even at the lowest tested oxygen concentration. At 48 hpf survival was \n\ndecreased at concentrations below 18.75 \u00b5mol/L. Hundred percent mortality was observed \n\nat 96 h at concentrations below 9.37 \u00b5mol/L. For the same stage a 96 h-LC50 of 13.17 \u00b1 1.7 \n\n\u00b5mol/L (Table 2 and 3, Fig. 1 c) was calculated. At DO below 4 mg/L, sublethal effects \n\ncould be observed such as decreased heart rate (48 hpf), increased incidence of pericardial \n\nedema (48 hpf and 96 hpf, Fig. S7 a, b) and developmental delay (48 and 96 hpf, Fig. 2 c, d \n\nand e, Fig S7 c). At 96 h embryos exposed to oxygen concentration of - 62.5 \u00b5mol/L \n\nshowed a developmental delay of 20 h compared to the control and according to stage \n\nclassifications based on Kimmel, et al. (1995) (with developmental time corrected for a \n\ntemperature of 26\u00ba C). I.e. the pec fin stage that was reached 60 hpf of controls was only \n\nachieved at 96 hpf in exposed embryos. This developmental delay was coinciding with a \n\ndecreased hatching rate (Fig S7 d) and a reduced body length (Fig S7 e). Body length was \n\nalready reduced at DO concentrations where no other adverse effects were observed 125 \n\n\u00b5mol/L.  \n\n\n\nZebrafish embryos tolerance to environmental stress factors \n\n69 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 1 - Zebrafish embryos survival after exposure to environmental stress: a) Survival after 24 - 96 \nh of exposure to acid pH (no increase in lethality after exposure for 24 h); b) Survival after 24 - 96 \nh of exposure to alkaline pH (no increase in lethality after exposure for 24 h); c) Survival after \nexposure to low oxygen concentrations at 48 and 96 h; and d) Survival rate at 72 h after exposure \nto UV radiation; CRC means Concentration Response Curve. \n\n \n\n3.3 UVR effects on zebrafish embryo survival and development  \n\nIn order to determine the effects of UVR on zebrafish survival and development, \n\nzebrafish embryos were continuously exposed to UVR (280 nm \u2013 400 nm) over a 96 h \n\nperiod. The continous exposure was selected for compatibility with combinded \n\nstress/mixture experiments with chemicals, which requires a contineous exposure. Given \n\nthat it is known that continuous illumination can already affect the development, a \n\ncontinuous light control was conducted. The control and the continuous light control \n\ngroups developed normally, no mortality and/or developmental effects were observed in \n\nboth normal photoperiod and the continuous light control.

Due to technical constraints \n\n(availability of suitable UV filters) it was not possible to test lower UVR intensities in \n\norder to derive 96 h-LC50. Therefore, effect concentration could only be determined for an \n\nexposure up to 72 h. The 72 h-LC50 was 227 \u00b1 6.55 mW/m2 (Table 2 and 3, Fig. 1 d). UVR \n\nexposure also induced a variety of sublethal effects on embryos including increased \n\nincidence of edema (Fig. S8 c), inhibition of hatching (Fig S8  a), reduced heartbeat (Fig. \n\nS8 b) and deformities. UVR intensities above 107 mW/m2 significantly increased general \n\nmalformations at 48 h (Fig. S8 d) and spine deformities at 72 h (Fig. S8 e).

Discussion \n\nIn this study the effects of changes in pH, low DO levels and increased UVR \n\nintensities on the survival and development of zebrafish embryos were evaluated. The \n\nimpact of these environmental stress factors have been studied in various aquatic organism \n\nfrom algae to vertebrates (Heugens et al., 2001; Holmstrup et al., 2010; Laskowski et al., \n\n2010). Data were also partially available for the zebrafish embryo but a comprehensive and \n\ndetailed analysis including a time-course analysis as a basis to study combinatorial effects \n\nwith chemicals was lacking. E.g. the pH effects on zebrafish development was previously \n\nonly assessed for the acidic range by Dave (1984) who observed reduced survival at \n\nextreme acidic pH. However, in the study of Dave (1984) the pH fluctuations in some \n\ncases exceeded more than 1 pH unit and mortality at pH around 4 and 7 may have been \n\npartially provoked also by high buffer concentrations (1.1 mM citrate-HCl and 1.3 mM \n\nphosphate) used to stabilize the pH (Dave, 1985). The effects of oxygen limitation has \n\nbeen studied in zebrafish embryos from 48 to 168 hpf by K\u00fcster and Altenburger (2008), \n\nShang and Wu (2004) and Strecker et al (2011) but none of  them provided a \n\nconcentration-response relationship for the endpoints assessed.  Regarding UVR effects, \n\nthe studies available (e. g. Charron et al., 2000; Dethlefsen et al., 2001; Dong et al., 2007) \n\ndid not perform a continuous exposure to UV light which would facilitate to model data for \n\nsubsequent experiments targeting to analyse combinatorial effects with chemicals. \n\nThe compromising effects of acidic or alkaline pH, oxygen depletion and UV \n\nradiations are also long known and our study confirmed the expected results for the \n\nzebrafish embryo.

Generally our data agreed with previous literature on fish \n\ntoxicity, where pH showed to significantly impact on fish survival at values below 5 \n\n(Dave, 1984; Jordahl and Benson, 1987) and above 10 (Kaur and Toor, 1980; Le Louarn \n\nand Webb, 1998). Cardiac effects, i.e. pericardial edemas and reduced heart rate were the \n\nmost prominent observed sublethal effects for acidic and alkaline pH, however, they were \n\nobserved at concentrations close to mortality and may be associated with overall toxicity \n\nrather than representing specific effects (see Table 2 and 3). \n\nFurthermore, at the alkaline range a hatching delay was observed. This effect was \n\nalso observed in Silurus asotus at alkaline pH (Gao et al., 2011). Hatching delay is often \n\nassociated with a reduction in the activity of the enzyme chorionase (Yamagami, 1981) \n\nwhich seems to be pH dependent with an optimum at around pH 8.5 (for the fish \n\nCoregonus albula L and C. lavaretus L) (Luczynski et al., 1987). Alternatively, pH may \n\nincrease the hardness of the chorion and reduce hatching capability (EL-Fiky, 2002).  \n\nSeveral processes may be involved in pH related toxicity: (i) the interference with \n\nstructure and functioning of proteins (Kapetaniou et al., 2006), in case that intracellular pH \n\ncannot be maintained.  Activity of  proteins generally exhibit pH optima ranging from pH 5 \n\nto 9 (e.g. Talley 2010). (ii) more energy may be required to maintain intracellular pH-\n\nlevels. If the intracellular pH is affected, the energy budget is further compromised, since \n\nthe generation of ATP is enabled via proton gradients at the mitochondria (Mitchell, 1961). \n\n(iii) the interference in the osmotic regulation of essential ions. (iv) for alkaline condition, \n\nthe disturbances in ammonia excretion and acid base regulations is considered as the major \n\ncause for toxicity (Baldisserotto, 2011; Bolner and Baldisserotto, 2007; Wilkie and Wood, \n\n1996).  Although fish can compensate changes in the external pH (Claiborne et al., 2002), \n\nthe mortality observed in zebrafish embryo is likely to be associated with levels above the \n\ncompensation capacity, with compromising effects on protein function and/or energy \n\nbudget. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nZebrafish embryos tolerance to environmental stress factors \n\n74 \n \n\n4.2 Oxygen depletion effects on zebrafish embryo survival and development \n\nContrary to pH, DO effects on zebrafish embryo were strongly dependent on the \n\nexposure duration (Table 2 and 3). The results were in concordance with previous studies \n\nin zebrafish which reported developmental effects such as delay, heart rate decrease, \n\nincreased incidence of edemas and reduced body length at oxygen concentrations below \n\n4.2 mg/L; (K\u00fcster and Altenburger, 2008; Strecker et al., 2011)  and reduced survival rates \n\nat 0.5 mg/L (Shang and Wu, 2004). Padilla and Roth (2001) showed that zebrafish \n\nembryos exposed to anoxia conditions enter a stage of arrested development which can be \n\nsurvived up to 24 h without any deleterious effect on subsequent development if oxygen \n\nlevels are restored. This capacity to survive low levels of oxygen is likely related to a \n\ndecrease in metabolism as an organisms\u2019 strategy to reduce energy expenditure through \n\narrest of developments and the corresponding demand for energy to synthesis cellular \n\nmacromolecules such as proteins (Wu, 2002). Ton et al. (2003) has shown changes in gene \n\nexpression including drastic suppression of ATP demand and shutting down of protein \n\nsynthesis and cell division in zebrafish embryos under hypoxia. The observed reduction in \n\nbody length and heart rate that were also observed by other zebrafish embryo studies \n\n(Bagatto, 2005; Shang and Wu, 2004; Strecker et al, 2011), may be related to the \n\naforementioned biochemical adjustments but could also reflect a developmental delay and \n\nsecondary toxic responses to hypoxia conditions.   \n\n \n\n4.3 UVR effects on zebrafish embryo survival and development  \n\nIn order to establish concentration-response curves, embryos were continuously \n\nexposed to UVR throughout 72 hours (for technical reason longer exposure durations could \n\nnot be used for deriving concentration-dependent effects). Although not corresponding to a \n\nnatural exposure scenario, a continuous UVR exposure was selected to enable future \n\nstudies on the assessment of combined UV-light and chemical exposure including the \n\nmodelling of data. However, a continuous illumination cycle may interfere with the \n\ncircadian clock and impact the development and survival of organisms as it is well \n\ndocumented for the zebrafish embryo in the literature (e.g. Jensen et al., 2012; Villamizar \n\net al., 2013 among others). Villamizar et al., 2013 studied the effects of continuous light \n\n\n\nZebrafish embryos tolerance to environmental stress factors \n\n75 \n \n\nexposure or lack of illumination and observed effects on body length and survival rate \n\n(reduction by below 10%). Nevertheless, significant effects were only detected at 7 and 12 \n\ndpf respectively.  Similarly, in the study of Jensen et al., 2012, constant light exposure \n\n(1800 lux) did not affect viability or caused any abnormal phenotypes although effects on \n\nthe development of vasculatures were observed in 24 and 72 hpf embryos. Despite the \n\nobserved vascular defects under constant light, embryos development was not affected. In \n\nour study, no effects on survival or developmental endpoints were observed after exposure \n\nto constant light. Therefore, the effects observed under UVR exposure can be mainly \n\nattributed to UV light and not to the alteration of the dark:light cycle. In addition, as \n\nreviewed by Vatine et al., 2011, although  clock gene expression are detected in zebrafish \n\nembryos at the first  24 hpf, no circadian rhythms of S phase are evident during the first 3 \n\ndays of development demonstrating that these rhythms are dispensable for normal growth \n\nand development in the laboratory environment.  \n\nTo our knowledge no other study has used a continuous UV exposure and hence, \n\ncomparison to other results is difficult. E.g. in the study of Dong et al. (2007) a 24 h-LD50 \nof 2.32 J/cm2 was obtained for zebrafish embryos exposed to short-term pulses of UVR \n\nduring the first 24 h of development. The continuous exposure to UVR showed a strong \n\ntime-dependent impact on embryo survival leading to 100% mortality at 96 hpf for all \n\nintensities tested.   \n\nIn our study, UVR also affected hatching \u2013 in agreement with studies on amphibian \n\n(Blaustein et al., 1997) and others fish embryos (Dethlefsen et al., 2001; Dong et al., 2007). \n\nThe hatching delay/inhibition may be related to a reduced spontaneous movement of \n\nembryos mainly caused by an increased incidence of malformations that may hinder \n\nmovement and reduce embryos ability to move to breach the egg shell.  \n\nDevelopmental abnormalities have already been reported previously for zebrafish \n\nand other species exposed to UVR.  In the study of Dong, Svoboda et al. (2007) embryos \n\nexposed to UVR doses ? 0.93 J/cm2 exhibited spinal deformities while Fujimoto et al., \n\n(2007) observed edema, deformed head and double body axis in embryos of Misgurnus \n\nanguillicaudatus. These effects were discussed as a result of impairment of body axis \n\nformation through the UVR provoked disruption of the formation of the cellular \n\nmicrotubule array (Jesuthasan and Str\u00e4hle, 1997; Str\u00e4hle and Jesuthasan, 1993). \n\n\n\nZebrafish embryos tolerance to environmental stress factors \n\n76 \n \n\nThe observed EC50 or LC50 values of the environmental stressors tested are unlikely \n\n(with potentially the exception of O2 levels in some areas) to be of direct relevance for \n\nclimate change impacts. However, the detailed concentration-dependent analysis would \n\nallow studying the interaction with chemical effects at low effect levels of the stressors, \n\nusing for instance established models of mixture analysis. Future research can now build \n\non the availability of detailed description of the impact of stress factors on zebrafish \n\ndevelopment and survival. \n\n \n\n5. Conclusion \n\nThe present study intended to comprehensively evaluate the effects of oxygen level, \n\npH and UV-irradiation using a detailed concentration-response on zebrafish embryos. All \n\nstressors showed clear concentration- or intensity-dependent, respectively, effects on \n\nzebrafish embryo survival allowing the application of established concentration-response \n\nmodels and deriving half-maximal effect concentrations (LC50, EC50). These data provide \n\nan important source to study the interaction of environmental stress factors with \n\ncontaminants in the zebrafish embryo model in the context of climate change scenario.  \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n \nThis study was funded by FEDER through COMPETE and Programa Operacional Factores \n\nde Competitividade and by National funding through FCT- Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e \n\nTecnologia, within Climatox FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-027795 (Ref.

The main concern with the use of pesticides is the impact in non-\ntarget wildlife with serious consequences to aquatic ecosystems. Typically, environmental \nconcentrations of pesticides rarely cause lethality; therefore the risk assessment of these \nchemicals is better achieved if a battery of sublethal endpoints is used.  Within this context, \nthe main goal of this work was to evaluate the effects of Carbaryl \u2013 a carbamate insecticide \n\u2013 in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo survival, development, biomarkers and behaviour. \nDevelopmental endpoints included delay, hatching success, edema incidence, \nmalformations, reduction of size and alterations in heartbeat rate. Biomarkers included \nAcetylcholinesterase (AChE), Glutathione-S-transferase (GST), Lactate dehydrogenase \n(LDH) and Catalase (CAT). Behaviour was assessed through a locomotion assay at 96 hpf \n(hours post fertilization) using the Zebrabox (Viewpoint, France) video tracking system. \nCarbaryl effects on zebrafish embryos survival was dose dependent with a 96 h-LC50 of \n14.94 mg/L. At the sublethal level, carbaryl significantly affected heartbeat rate, decreased \nbody length and increased incidence of edema and malformations. Moreover, carbaryl \nexposure resulted in significant decrease in enzymatic activity (AChE, GST and LDH) and \nalterations in the locomotor behaviour of zebrafish embryos reflected by a decrease in the \ntotal distance moved. When compared to the developmental endpoints (mortality/survival, \nedemas, heart beat and etc.), biomarkers and locomotor behaviour were the most sensitive \nparameters showing effects at very low concentrations. This study highlights the \nimportance of considering the sublethal effects of environmental contaminants in risk \nassessment in order to better estimate their effects in aquatic ecosystems.  \n\nKeywords: Danio rerio, behaviour, carbamate insecticide, sublethal effects \n\n \n \n\n\n\nEffects of carbaryl to zebrafish embryos \n\n95 \n \n\n1. Introduction \n \n\nPesticides have become a major environmental problem. The use (and abuse) of \n\npesticides in agriculture is widespread all over the world and has increased in the last years \n\n(except in some regions) as a consequence of the increase in human population and crop \n\nproduction. According to EPA (Environmental Protection Agency), in 2007 pesticides use \n\nworldwide topped approximately 2.5 billion kilograms (EPA, 2007). Moreover, the \n\nincreased in the incidence of existing pest, diseases and weeds predicted under climate \n\nchange scenarios may imply a more extensive and frequent application of pesticides \n\nincreasing its use and bioavailability (Chen and Mccarl, 2001; Koleva and Schneider, \n\n2009; Mango et al., 2011; Reilly et al., 2003). The main problem with the use of pesticides \n\nis its migration from agricultural fields to aquatic environment by runoff or leaching \n\n(Larson, Capel et al. 1995, Battaglin, Thurman et al. 2003) which may increase their \n\nconcentrations in the water, threatening aquatic biota.   \n\nInsecticides represent a large (33 %) proportion of total pesticides used worldwide \n\n(Stokstad and Grull\u00f3n, 2013). Carbaryl (1-naphthyl-N-methylcarbamate) is among the \n\nmost widely used carbamate insecticide and is applied to control a broad spectrum of insect \n\npests on crop and non-crop sites including domestic gardens (CCME, 2009). Low \n\nconcentrations of carbaryl ranging from 0.1 to 1737 \u00b5g/L (Vryzas et al., 2009; Walters et \n\nal., 2003; Wilsont and Foos, 2006) have been detected in surface waters both adjacent to \n\nagricultural fields and urban areas (Munn et al., 2006; Phillips and Bode, 2004).  Generally \n\nenvironmental concentrations are in the sublethal range which strengthens the importance \n\nof using appropriate tools to assess the risks posed by pesticides in more realistic scenarios. \n\nZebrafish early life stages tests focusing on developmental endpoints, biomarkers and \n\nbehaviour have been showing promising results to evaluate sublethal concentrations of \n\ncontaminants (Coelho et al., 2011; Oliveira et al., 2009).  \n\nLike most carbamates, carbaryl is a known acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor \n\nwith a resulting disruption of nerve impulse transmissions. The presence of carbaryl \n\nprevents AChE from breaking down acetylcholine causing it to accumulate in the nervous \n\nsystem (Fukuto, 1990). As a consequence, the continuous stimulation of the muscle leads \n\nto uncontrolled, rapid movement of some muscles, paralysis, convulsions and even death \n\n(Gruber and Munn, 1998; Gunasekara et al., 2008; Mora et al., 2000; Scaps et al., 1997). In \n\n\n\nEffects of carbaryl to zebrafish embryos \n\n96 \n \n\naddition, carbaryl is also teratogenic, causing developmental and hatching delay, defects in \n\nheart formation including defect in cardiac looping, pericardial edema and decrease in \n\nheart rate and affected body length in zebrafish embryos (Gallo et al., 1995; C C Lin et al., \n\n2007; Schock et al., 2012; Todd and Van Leeuwen, 2002).  \n\nThe fish embryo toxicity test (FET) has been validated and adopted by OECD \n\n(Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) (OECD, 2013) and is now \n\nwidely used with zebrafish. Among many other advantages, the transparency of zebrafish \n\neggs allow the monitoring of the entire organogenesis permitting the study of a wide range \n\nof sublethal endpoints including anomalies (edemas, tail deformities etc.) and \n\ndevelopmental delay (hatching delay) (Lammer et al., 2009; Scholz et al., 2008). \n\nMoreover, the use of zebrafish early life stages for the assessment of behaviour is also \n\nbecoming popular (Fetcho and Liu, 1998; Tierney, 2011). Behaviour is linked to a range of \n\nstress responses such as physiological and biochemical disturbances (Beauvais et al., 2000; \n\nTierney et al., 2007) and represents an interface between internal (physiological) and \n\nexternal (environmental, social) forces that may have serious implications in health and \n\norganisms survival (Little et al., 1990). In this context locomotor behavioural analysis \n\nrepresents a sensitive tool for detection and evaluation of sublethal effects of chemicals as \n\ncompared to conventional endpoints such as survival (Levin et al., 2004).  \n\nIn the present study we aimed to assess the toxicity of carbaryl to zebrafish \n\nembryos focusing on sublethal endpoints such as developmental endpoints (hearbeat, \n\nedema, body length etc.), biochemical makers (Cholinesterase, Glutathione-S-transferase, \n\nLactate dehydrogenase and Catalase) and behaviour (total distance moved). Although \n\nprevious studies have already reported carbaryls\u2019 toxicity to zebrafish embryos, the present \n\nstudy provides detailed concentration-dependent analysis (LCx or ECx) throughout the \n\nwhole embryonic and early larval development (0-96h). Moreover, we are unaware of any \n\nstudies addressing the effects of carbaryl on locomotor behaviour of zebrafish \n\neleutheroembryos.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nEffects of carbaryl to zebrafish embryos \n\n97 \n \n\n2. Materials and Methods \n \n\n2.1 Zebrafish maintenance and embryo collection \n \n\nAll the embryos used in the present study were provided by the zebrafish (Danio \n\nrerio) facility established at the Department of Biology, University of Aveiro (Portugal). \n\nAdults were maintained in carbon-filtered water, complemented with salt \u201cInstant Ocean \n\nSynthetic Sea Salt\u201d (Spectrum Brands, USA) and automatically adjusted for pH and \n\nconductivity. Water temperature was kept at 26.0 \u00b1 1 \u00baC, conductivity at 750 \u00b1 50 \u00b5S, pH \n\nat 7.5 \u00b1 0.5 and dissolved oxygen equal or above 95 % saturation. A 16:8 h (light:dark) \n\nphotoperiod cycle was maintained. This reconstituted water was used in the preparation of \n\ntest solutions of all assays performed. The above mentioned temperature and photoperiod \n\nconditions were constant in all assays. The adult fish were fed twice a day with \n\ncommercially available artificial diet (ZM-400 fish food; Zebrafish Management Ltd) and \n\nbrine shrimp. Zebrafish eggs were obtained by crossbreeding of individuals in aquaria; \n\nafter 30 min of natural mating, eggs were rinsed in water and checked under a \n\nstereomicroscope (Stereoscopic Zoom Microscope -SMZ 1500, Nikon Corporation); those \n\nunfertilized, with cleavage irregularities, injuries or other type of malformations were \n\ndiscarded.  \n\n \n\n2.2 Test Chemical and Preparation of Test Solutions \n \n\nCarbaryl (1-Naphthyl-N-methylcarbamate) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. \n\nStock solutions of carbaryl were prepared fresh by dissolving it in water and test solutions \n\nwere prepared by diluting the stock. Ten ml of each tested concentration were sampled at \n\nthe beginning and at the end of the assay and preserved at -20 \u00baC to further chemical \n\nanalysis. The chemical analysis was performed at Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry \n\nand Biochemistry, University of South Bohemia in ?esk\u00e9 Bud?jovice, Czech Republic. \n\nThe results are presented in supplementary materials Table S1. \n\n \n\n\n\nEffects of carbaryl to zebrafish embryos \n\n98 \n \n\n \n\n2.3 Embryo assay \n \n\nThe assay was based on the OECD guideline (236) on Fish Embryo Acute Toxicity \n\n(FET) Test (OECD, 2013). The test started with eggs at 3 hours post fertilizations (hpf), \n\npreviously selected and exposed to concentrations ranging from 1 to 30 mg/L of carbaryl. \n\nTen eggs per treatment were distributed in 24-wells microplates in triplicate and run for \n\n96h. Embryos were observed daily under a stereomicroscope (Stereoscopic Zoom \n\nMicroscope \u2013 SMZ 1500, Nikon Corporation, Japan). The following endpoints were \n\nevaluated: survival, incidence of pericardial edema, heartbeat rate, presence of \n\nhaemorrhage (clutch of red blood cell), malformations, hatching and body length (total \n\nlength: snout to tail tip). Heartbeat rate (beats/15s) was measured by counting heart beats \n\nunder the stereomicroscope in 3 randomly selected embryos of each replicate (n=9 per \n\nconcentration) at 48h. Body length was measured using digital images of the embryos with \n\nthe software NIS Elements D (Nikon Corporation, Japan).  \n\nFor analysis of biomarkers and locomotory activity, sublethal concentrations of \n\ncarbaryl were used ranging from 0.00075 to 0.75 mg/L and from 0.0001 to 5 mg/L \n\nrespectively. These tests were carried out in the same conditions as the above described \n\ntest. For biomarkers, at 96 hours of exposure, 10 clusters of eight larvae per treatment were \n\nsnap-frozen in microtubes containing 0.8 ml of K-phosphate buffer (0.1M, pH 7.4) and \n\nstored at - 80 \u00baC for further enzymatic analysis (see section 2.4). For locomotory assay \n\nlarvae were transferred to 96 well plates and analysed using the track system Zebrabox \n\n(Viewpoint, Lyon, France) at 96 h (see section 2.5). \n\n \n\n2.4 Biomarker determinations \n \n\nEnzymatic assays were performed to analyse cholinesterase (ChE), glutathione-S-\n\ntransferase (GST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and catalase (CAT) activities in zebrafish \n\nembryos. On the day of enzymatic analyses, samples were defrosted on ice, homogenised \n\n(KIKA Labortechnik U2005 Control) and centrifuged at 4 \u00baC, 10000 g, during 20 min in \n\norder to isolate the post-mitochondrial supernatant (PMS) posteriorly used as enzyme \n\n\n\nEffects of carbaryl to zebrafish embryos \n\n99 \n \n\nextract for enzymatic activity determination. All determinations were made \n\nspectrophotometrically (Thermo Scientific Multiskan Spectrum, USA) using 96 wells \n\nmicroplates. \n\nProtein quantification in samples was performed in quadruplicate according to the \n\nBradford method (Bradford, 1976), at 595 nm, using ?- globulin to determine standard \n\ncurve. The method for the determination of ChE, GST and LDH activity is described in \n\nDomingues et al. (2010). Briefly, ChE activity was determined using acetylthiocholine as \n\nsubstrate and measuring at 414 nm (every 20 s, for 5 min) the conjugation product between \n\nthiocoline (a product of the degradation of acetylthiocholine) and 5,5-dithiobis-2- \n\nnitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) (absorbance increase), according to the method of Ellman et al. \n\n(1961). Activity determinations were made using 40 ?L of PMS, 250 ?L of reaction \n\nmixture (acetylthiocholine (75 mM), and DTNB (10 mM)) in Kphosphate buffer (0.1 M, \n\npH 7.2).  \n\nGST activity was determined at 340 nm by monitoring the increase in absorbance every \n\n20 s, during 5 min, following the general protocol described by Habig and Jakoby (1981) \n\nadapted to microplate reader (Frasco and Guilhermino, 2002). Activity determinations \n\nwere performed using 100 ?L of PMS from the sample and 200 ?L of reaction solution (10 \n\nmM reduced glutathione (GSH) and 60 mM 1-chloro-2.4-dinitrobenzene in K-phosphate \n\nbuffer (0.05 M, pH 6.5)). \n\nCAT activity was measured at 240 nm in spectrophotometer quartz cell by monitoring \n\n(every 10 s, for 2 min) the decrease of absorbance due to degradation of H2O2, as described \n\nby Clairborne (1985). Fifteen microliters of PMS was mixed with 135 ?L of reaction \n\nsolution (H2O2, 30 mM) and 150 ?L of K-phosphate buffer (0.05 M, pH 7.0). \n\nLDH activity was measured at 340 nm and was based on the decrease of absorbance (5 \n\nmin) due to the oxidation of NADH, following the methodology described by Vassault \n\n(1983) with the modifications introduced by Diamantino et al. (2001). Activity \n\ndeterminations were made using 40 ?l of PMS of the sample, 250 ?l of NADH (0.24 mM) \n\nand 40 ?l of piruvate (10 mM) in Tris\u2013NaCl buffer (100 mM, pH 7.2). \n\nEnzymatic activity were determined in quadruplicate and expressed in nanomoles of \n\nsubstrate hydrolyzed per minute per mg of protein. A Labsystem Multiskan EX microplate \n\n(Labsystems Inc., Franklin, MA) reader was used to determine all protein and enzymatic \n\nactivity.  \n\n\n\nEffects of carbaryl to zebrafish embryos \n\n100 \n \n\n \n\n2.5 Locomotory activity assay \n \n\nTo assess carbaryl effects on locomotor activity, zebrafish larvae at 96 hpf were \n\nused. Locomotion was evaluated for 24 embryos per treatment including the control in 96 \n\nwell plates (one embryo per well). Embryonic movement was tracked using the Zebrabox-\n\nZEB 478 (software version 3.22, Viewpoint Life Sciences, Lyon, France) a system that \n\nmonitors the movement by automated video recording with an infrared camera (25 images \n\nper second). Typically zebrafish larvae show less locomotion during light periods and \n\nmore during dark. Therefore, movement was stimulated by applying light:dark intervals \n\naccording to what was described in Irons et al (2010). Briefly, embryonic movements were \n\nrecorded during light-dark intervals over a period of 20 minutes (5 min light, 10 min dark, \n\n5 min light). For each replicate the distances moved in 1 minute intervals were recorded \n\nseparately and only locomotion in the dark period was used to calculate the differences \n\nbetween control and treated embryos. The parameter total distance moved was calculated \n\nand refers to the total swimming distance of the larvae during each measurement period.  \n\n2.5 Statistical analysis \n \n\nSigmaplot for Windows V.12.5 (Systat Software, 2008) was used for statistical \n\nanalyses. One-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) was used to test differences between the \n\ndifferent treatments in normally distributed data sets. When datasets failed the Kolmogorov \n\nSmirnov normality test, an ANOVA on ranks (Kruskall-Wallis) was performed and the \n\nDunnet\u2019s or Dunn\u2019s post-hoc test where used to compare each treatment against control. \n\nLethal concentrations (LCx) and effective concentrations (ECx) values were calculated for \n\neach developmental endpoint by fitting dose-response curves. A significance level of 0.05 \n\nwas used to infer statistically significant results. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nEffects of carbaryl to zebrafish embryos \n\n101 \n \n\n3.

Discussion \n \n\n4.1 Carbaryl effects on embryos survival and development \n \n\nPesticides are one of the major sources of ecological contamination and their \n\nimpacts in the environment are an important target of research. Carbaryls\u2019 use started in \n\nthe late 1950s (Chemical Watch) and in the past decades its toxicity has been studied in \n\ndifferent model organisms. Carbaryl toxicity to fish early life stages varies accordingly to \n\nthe fish species and stage of development. Table S3 (supplementary data) summarizes the \n\nliterature review for carbaryl toxicity in fish early developmental stages. The toxicity of \n\ncarbaryl to zebrafish embryos have been explored in three different studies, however, \n\nE(L)Cx values were reported only by Lin et al (2007) for the 24 hpf (LC50 =  44.66 and \n\nEC50 = 7.52 mg/l). For adult fish a 96 h-LC50 of 9.26 mg/L was reported for zebrafish \n\n(Gallo et al., 1995) while for other fish species varies between 2.51 and 7.89 mg/L. In our \n\nCarbaryl (mg/L)\n\n0 1e-4 1e-3 0.01 0.1 1 5\n\nTo\nta\n\nl d\nis\n\nta\nnc\n\ne \nm\n\nov\ned\n\n (c\nm\n\n)\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n*\n\n* *\n\n\n\nEffects of carbaryl to zebrafish embryos \n\n107 \n \n\nstudy the 96 h-LC50 was 14.94 mg/L and the effects of carbaryl on zebrafish survival \n\nshowed to be dose-dependent which are consistent with previous results (Schock et al., \n\n2012) (Fig. 1).  \n\nAt low concentrations, carbaryl exposure caused developmental and hatching delay \n\nand shortened body length of fish embryos (Kashiwada et al., 2008; Todd and Van \n\nLeeuwen, 2002). In our experiments, carbaryl caused hatching delay and was also \n\nresponsible for a significant reduction of approximately 0.6 mm on body size of embryos. \n\nCarbaryl\u2019s mechanism of reducing body length has not been reported in the literature. This \n\ndecrease in body length may be due to the metabolic costs associated with the \n\ndetoxification of the pesticide leading to a reduction of individual fitness as hypothesized \n\nfor fish and amphibians exposed to metal and pesticides (Cook et al., 2005; Diana et al., \n\n2000; Schock et al., 2012). Development, hatching delay and reduced fitness may have \n\nserious implications in fish survival as it makes them more susceptible to predation.  \n\nMoreover, carbaryl has also shown to impair cardiovascular development of fish \n\nembryos causing heart malformations, pericardial edemas and bradycardia. Kashiwada et \n\nal (Kashiwada et al., 2008) studying carbaryl effects on medaka (Oryzias latipes) embryos, \n\nreported an increased rate of tubular heart and pericardial edema formation and a reduction \n\nin heartbeat rate at sublethal concentrations (5-10 mg/L). Morphological defects in cardiac \n\ndevelopment were also found in zebrafish embryos exposed to carbaryl. Schock et al., \n\n(2012) observed a decrease in cardiac precursor field as well as defects and delays in \n\ncardiac tube migration and fusion. In addition, they also observed delayed or defective \n\ncardiac looping in exposed embryos. In our studies, carbaryl induced a significant decrease \n\nin heart beat even at low concentrations (4.3 mg/L) (Fig. 2c) and also increased the \n\nincidence of pericardial edema (Table 1, Fig. 2b, 3a). Pericardial edema seems to be a \n\ncommon feature in carbaryl-exposed embryos as reported for medaka and zebrafish \n\n(Kashiwada et al., 2008; C. C. Lin et al., 2007; Schock et al., 2012). Generally, AChE \n\ninhibitors (the case of carbaryl) have been reported to decrease heartbeat rate (Kashiwada \n\net al., 2008; Schock et al., 2012; Watson et al., 2014). Briefly, the increase in acetylcholine \n\nconcentration in the synaptic cleft caused by the presence of carbaryl (AChE inhibitor) \n\nlead to continuous signals from the acetylcholine receptor causing the decrease in heart \n\nrate (McKim et al., 1987). However, Lin et al., (2007) hypothesized that the decrease in \n\nheart beat at early developmental stages (2 dpf) may be due to an alternate mechanism of \n\n\n\nEffects of carbaryl to zebrafish embryos \n\n108 \n \n\ninhibition of calcium ion channels. Nevertheless, the exact nature of this mechanism is still \n\nunclear. \n\nCarbaryl is also teratogenic, causing bent tail, notochord bending and axial skeletal \n\ndefects in embryos of different species of amphibians (Bacchetta et al., 2008; Bridges, \n\n2000; Kang et al., 2010) and inducing changes in tail morphology in zebrafish (Schock et \n\nal., 2012). In our study, carbaryl exposure triggered a series of different phenotypes in \n\nzebrafish embryos such as, haemorrhage, pericardial edema, tails deformities and spine \n\ncurvature (Fig. 4b-f). This increase in developmental abnormalities may also be related to \n\nAChE inhibition action of carbaryl. Bacchetta et al., (2008) hypothesized cholinesterase \n\ninhibition with consequent repetitive muscular spasms to be responsible to the abnormal \n\ntail flexure of the amphibian embryos of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis). Kang et \n\nal., (2010) sustain the same hypothesis as a consequence of several developmental \n\nabnormalities found in Boulenger (Bombina orientalis) embryos exposed to carbaryl. \n\nBehra et al., (2002) studying the AChE role in the neuronal and muscular development of \n\nzebrafish embryos concluded that AChE activity is essential for the correct development of \n\nthe muscle apparatus preventing damage in subsequent developmental stages. In our study, \n\ntail deformities were common in zebrafish larvae at 96 hpf in a dose dependent manner and \n\nmay be related to carbaryl ability to inhibit AChE activity.    \n\n \n\n4.2 Effects of carbaryl on biochemical makers and locomotor activity of zebrafish embryos \n \n\n In the present study carbaryl was found to alter the swimming behaviour of \n\nzebrafish embryos exposed to concentration equal or higher than 0.1 mg /L. These \n\nalterations in swimming behaviour can disrupt feeding (capability to capture prey), impair \n\nthe ability to attract mates, and increase vulnerability to predation (through an inability to \n\nremain inconspicuous) which may have serious implications for long term survival (Little \n\nand Finger, 1990) and makes locomotor activity an important and relevant parameter for \n\nthe risk assessment of pesticides. Our results are in good agreement with previous studies \n\nwhere adverse effects of acute exposure to insecticides on fish swimming behaviour were \n\nalso found. For example, a decrease in locomotor activity was also observed in juvenile \n\ngoldfish (Carassius auratus) exposed to another carbamate insecticide carbofuran (50 and \n\n\n\nEffects of carbaryl to zebrafish embryos \n\n109 \n \n\n100 \u00b5g/L) (Bretaud et al., 2001); a markedly decrease in swimming activity was observed \n\nin rainbow trout larvae (Onchorhynchus mykiss) after exposure to two organophosphate \n\ninsecticide namely diazinon and malathion (Beauvais et al., 2000);  similarly, Beauvais et \n\nal., (2001) reported a decrease in swimming speed of rainbow trout larvae (Onchorhynchus \n\nmykiss) exposed to carbaryl. \n\nAs expected for a carbamate insecticide, carbaryl significantly inhibited the activity \n\nof AChE (Fig. 5a). AChE is closely related with behavioural changes as pointed out by \n\nScott and Slomman 2004. Therefore, AChE inhibition may be correlated to the decrease in \n\nswimming performance of zebrafish embryos observed in this study. Similarly, previous \n\nresearch also related AChE inhibition to changes in behaviour for other fish species \n\nexposed to carbaryl and other carbamate insecticides for example, in the rainbow trout \n\nlarvae (Oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed to carbaryl (Beauvais et al., 2001) and the gold fish \n\n(Carassius auratus) exposed to carbofuran (Bretaud et al., 2001). \n\nGST and LDH activities were also inhibited after exposure to carbaryl (Fig. 5 b and \n\nc). Both enzymes activities were also reported to be affected (decreased) after exposure to \n\ncarbamate insecticides. Exposure to 0.25 mg/L of carbaryl decreased GST activity in the \n\nliver of nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) (Matos et al., 2007). Similarly, the carbamate \n\ninsecticide isoprocarb also significantly inhibited gill GST activity of gold fish (Carassius \n\nauratus) (Wang et al., 2012). Regarding LDH, Singh &amp; Sharma (1998) demonstrated that \n\nexposure to carbofuran significantly decreased enzymatic activity in different body tissues \n\nof the teleost fish Clarias batrachus.  \n\nThese two enzymes are directly involved in metabolic activity of organisms. GST \n\nplay a crucial role in the biotransformation (metabolism) of xenobiotic compounds and its \n\nactivity may be induced or inhibited after exposure to xenobiotics (Hyne and Maher, \n\n2003). LDH is an important enzyme in the anaerobic pathway of energy production and is \n\nalso involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates (Diamantino et al., 2001). Considering \n\nthat metabolism is closely related with fish behaviour as reviewed by Sloman et al 2004, \n\nthe observed inhibition of GST and LDH activities may have also be involved in the \n\nreduction of the total swimming distance of embryos exposed to carbaryl.  \n\nIn this study, carbaryl exposure showed to significantly impact zebrafish embryos \n\nsurvival and development. Moreover, sublethal concentrations were responsible to \n\ndecrease the total swimming distance and also inhibited ChE, GST and LDH activities \n\n\n\nEffects of carbaryl to zebrafish embryos \n\n110 \n \n\nwhich effects are likely correlated. However, further studies correlating behavioural \n\nmeasures and biochemical marks are necessary to elucidate the specific mechanisms by \n\nwhich alterations in neurotransmission and/or metabolic enzymes result in changes in \n\nbehaviour. Sublethal levels of carbaryl showed to affect embryos at concentrations more \n\nthan ten times below the 96 h-LC50 (at 0.0075 mg/L for biomarkers and 0.1 mg/L for \n\nbehaviour). This raises concern regarding carbaryl toxicity to aquatic biota since this \n\ninsecticide is widely used and has been already detected in freshwater bodies in higher \n\nconcentrations (0.1-1737 \u00b5g/L) (Vryzas et al., 2009; Walters et al., 2003; Wilsont and \n\nFoos, 2006). Therefore, our results highlight the importance of biomarkers and behavior \n\nendpoints in the risk assessment of pesticides. Although the total swimming distance was \n\nless sensitive compared to the biomarkers used, this endpoint is very important due to its \n\necological relevance and should be used as a complement in developmental studies.  \n\n5. Conclusion \n \n\nThe effects of carbaryl on zebrafish embryos development were analysed. Carbaryl \n\nshowed to have a great impact in fish embryonic development reducing survival, delaying \n\nhatching, causing edema and deformities and affecting heartbeat and embryos size. The \n\ndata presented here besides confirming previous findings, also give a more detailed \n\nanalysis of carbaryl effects on zebrafish embryos overall development throughout the \n\nembryonic and early larval stage (96 h). Moreover, in this study we provide novel data \n\ndemonstrating that sublethal concentrations of carbaryl affect locomotor behaviour of \n\nzebrafish which may indicate an overestimation of the effects of carbaryl specially in \n\ndeveloping embryos. Compared to survival or developmental parameters, biomarkers \n\nfollowed by behaviour were the most sensitive endpoints been capable of detecting effects \n\nin very low concentration of carbaryl. Therefore, combining developmental parameters as \n\nwell as the sensitiveness of biomarkers and behavioural endpoints seems to be an excellent \n\napproach to expand the sensitivity of standard toxicity tests and consequently improve the \n\nrisk assessment of pesticides.  \n\n\n\nEffects of carbaryl to zebrafish embryos \n\n111 \n \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n \n\nThis study was supported by a PhD grant (SFRH/BD/74501/2010) attributed to Thayres \n\nAndrade and by the Post-Doc grant (SFRH/BPD/90521/2012) attributed to In\u00eas \n\nDomingues by the Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation (FCT), funding by \n\nFEDER through COMPETE and Programa Operacional Factores de Competitividade and \n\nby National funding through FCT, within the research project Climatox\u2014Impact of \n\nclimatic changes on toxicity of pollutants (Ref.

The aim of this study was to \ninvestigate the toxic effects of carbendazim to zebrafish early life stages at several levels of \nbiological organization, including developmental, biochemical and behavioural levels. A \nfirst embryo assay was done following the OECD guideline 236 and using a concentration \nrange between 1.1 and 1.8 mg/L. Lethal and developmental endpoints such as hatching, \nedemas, malformations, heart rate, body growth and delays were assessed in a 96 hours \nexposure. A sub-teratogenic range (from 0.00016 to 0.5 mg/L) was then used to assess \neffects at biochemical and behavioural levels. Biochemical markers included \ncholinesterase (ChE), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and \ncatalase (CAT) and were assessed at 96 hours. The locomotor behaviour was assessed \nusing an automated video tracking system at 120 hours. Carbendazim showed high toxicity \nwith a 96h-LC50 of 1.75 mg/L while sublethal effects such as hatching success, edemas, \nmalformations, reduction of heart rate, body length and yolk sac consumption were \nobserved with EC50s ranging from 0.85 to 1.6 mg/L. Carbendazim exposure significantly \naltered biochemical parameters by inducing Che, GST and LDH activities at \nconcentrations equal or above 0.004 mg/L. The locomotor response of zebrafish embryos \nwas also affected as observed by alterations in swimming activity of larvae even at the \nlowest tested concentration (0.00016 mg/L). In this work, locomotion showed to be several \norders of magnitude more sensitive than developmental parameters or lethality, \nhighlighting the potential of behavioural endpoints as early warning signs for \nenvironmental stress. Further studies should focus on understanding how the behavioural \ndisturbances measured in these types of studies translate into fitness impairment at the \nadult stage.  \n\n \nKeywords: Danio rerio, locomotor response, biomarkers, sublethal effects \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCarbendazim effects on zebrafish embryos \n\n123 \n\n \n\n1. Introduction \n\nCarbendazim (methyl-1-H-benzimidazol-2-yl-carbamate) is one of the most widely \n\nused benzimidazole fungicides. It has a high toxicity to target organisms, inhibiting the \n\ndevelopment of a wide variety of fungi even at low doses. It is used in agriculture, \n\nhorticulture, forest and home gardening and as a preservative in paint, papermaking, \n\ntextile, leather industry, as well as a preservative of fruits (Selmano?lu, G.Barlas, \n\nN.Song\u00fcr, S.Ko\u00e7kaya, 2001). Carbendazim is a metabolite of benomyl and it is known to \n\ntarget the tubulin in cells, causing disruption of microtubule assembly and cell division \n\n(Davidse, 1986).  Many studies have reported the adverse effects of carbendazim on \n\nmammals mainly on reproductive organs (Farag et al., 2011; Ireland et al., 1979; Lim and \n\nMiller, 1997; Nakai et al., 2002; Urani et al., 1995). Low concentrations of carbendazim \n\nranging from 0.2 to 200 \u00b5g/L have already been detected in surface waters near agriculture \n\nand forestry areas (Palma et al., 2004; Readman et al., 1997). Moreover, carbendazim has \n\nshown to be very persistent in the water with a half-life of 6 to 25 weeks (Cuppen et al., \n\n2000a).  \n\nAlthough some of the toxic effects of carbendazim have been studied in mammals, \n\nits effects on aquatic organisms are poorly studied. The majority of studies available focus \n\non zooplankton and macroinvertebrate communities where chronic exposure to \n\ncarbendazim negatively affected these populations by decreasing survival, reproduction \n\nand feeding rates (Cuppen et al., 2000b; Daam et al., 2010; Ferreira et al., 2008; Ribeiro et \n\nal., 2011; Van den Brink et al., 2000). To our knowledge, there are only two studies \n\navailable concerning carbendazim effects on fish early life stages. The study by \n\nLudwikowska et al. (2013) showed that carbendazim could affect the survival and hatching \n\nsuccess of Prussian carp embryos at concentrations above 0.036 mg/L and the study of \n\nJiang et al. (2014) demonstrated that embryonic exposure to carbendazim led to significant \n\nchanges in the expression of genes related to apoptosis, immunotoxicity and endocrine \n\ndisruption in zebrafish (Danio rerio). In this later study concentrations between 0.004 and \n\n0.5 mg/L of carbendazim were tested, although gene expression effects for most of the \n\ngenes analyzed, did not follow a dose response pattern.  \n\nRisk characterization is better achieved by studying chemical effects at several \n\nlevels of biological organization. Recently, behavioural parameters such as locomotion \n\n\n\nCarbendazim effects on zebrafish embryos \n\n124 \n\n \n\n(whose evaluation have been considered time consuming and lacking objectivity) have been \n\nincreasingly used due to the development of technology for automated analysis. In the case \n\nof zebrafish, locomotion has been used as an endpoint to assess the neurotoxic effects of \n\nchemicals in early life stages (Irons et al., 2010; Padilla et al., 2011; Selderslaghs et al., \n\n2010) and the sublethal toxicity of pollutants (Ulhaq et al., 2013). In fact, many \n\ncontaminants disrupt fish behaviour after exposures much less severe than those causing \n\nmortality as demonstrated by Kl\u00fcver et al., (2015) where behaviour of fish embryos was \n\naltered at concentrations 375-fold lower than the LC10. Thus, behaviour has proven to \n\nprovide very sensitive measures of stress exposure; furthermore it has high ecological \n\nrelevance as effects can be translated in their long term health and survival (Scott and \n\nSloman, 2004; Tierney, 2011).  \n\nThus, in this work we aim at assessing the effects of carbendazim at several levels \n\nof biological organization using zebrafish embryos as model organism. Recently, the \n\napproval of the OECD Test Guideline n\u00ba 236 (fish embryo toxicity test) has consolidated \n\nthe zebrafish embryo test as a true alternative for the acute fish toxicity test with adults \n\n(Braunbeck et al., 2014a) in the European Union. This test has been increasingly used to \n\nassess the toxicity of chemicals and waste waters as reviewed by Scholz et al. (2013, \n\n2008). The low volume of test solutions needed (tests are deployed in 24 or 96-wells \n\nmicroplates), and the rapid development and transparency of embryos that allow the \n\nmonitoring of the entire organogenesis are among the advantages of this test. Moreover, \n\nthe possibility of measurement of behaviour (as referred above) and biochemical \n\nparameters such as AChE-acetylcholinesterase, GST \u2013 gluthatione-S-tranferase, LDH \u2013 \n\nlactate dehydrogenase, CAT - catalase (Oliveira et al., 2009), makes the zebrafish embryos \n\na very good model to analyze effects of chemicals at several levels, providing \n\ncomplementary information on the mode of action of the chemicals (Braunbeck et al., \n\n2014b; K\u00fcster and Altenburger, 2008) ultimately contributing to understand and establish \n\nthe Adverse Outcome Pathway \u2013 AOP - (a recent framework proposed by Ankle et al \n\n(2010) that directly link molecular-level initiating events that ultimately lead to adverse \n\noutcome at higher levels) for this fungicide. Once described, an AOP can be a key factor \n\nfor hazard identification in the risk assessment of chemicals (Ankley et al., 2010; Volz et \n\nal., 2011). This is particularly important considering the urgent need to reduce animal use \n\nfor toxicity testing in the European Union.  \n\n\n\nCarbendazim effects on zebrafish embryos \n\n125 \n\n \n\nThus, in the present study, zebrafish embryos were used to assess the toxic effects \n\nof carbendazim at several levels: \n\ni)  survival,  \n\nii) developmental level (including embryo development delays and malformations),  \n\niv) biochemical level (including the measurement of the enzymes AChE, GST, \n\nLDH and CAT) and  \n\nv) behavioural level (by measuring locomotion of zebrafish eleutheroembryos \n\nexpressed either by distance moved or time spent moving) \n\n \n\n2. Materials and Methods \n\n2.1 Zebrafish maintenance and embryo collection \n\nAll the embryos used in the present study were provided by the zebrafish facility \n\nestablished at the Department of Biology, University of Aveiro (Portugal). Adults were \n\nmaintained in carbon-filtered water, complemented with 0.34 mg/L salt (\u201cInstant Ocean \n\nSynthetic Sea Salt\u201d, Spectrum Brands, USA) and automatically adjusted for pH and \n\nconductivity. Water temperature was kept at 26.0 \u00b1 1 \u00baC, conductivity at 750 \u00b1 50 \u00b5S, pH \n\nat 7.5 \u00b1 0.5 and dissolved oxygen equal or above 95 % saturation. A 16:8 h (light:dark) \n\nphotoperiod cycle was maintained. This reconstituted water was used in the preparation of \n\ntest solutions of all assays performed. The above mentioned temperature and photoperiod \n\nconditions were constant in all assays. Zebrafish eggs were obtained by crossbreeding of \n\nindividuals in aquaria; after 30 min of natural mating, eggs were rinsed in water and \n\nchecked under a stereomicroscope (Stereoscopic Zoom Microscope -SMZ 1500, Nikon \n\nCorporation); those unfertilized, with cleavage irregularities, injuries or other kind of \n\nmalformations were discarded.  \n\n \n\n\n\nCarbendazim effects on zebrafish embryos \n\n126 \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2 Test Chemicals and Preparation of Test Solutions \n\nCarbendazim (Methyl 2-benzimidazolecarbamate, 97% purity) was purchased from \n\nSigma-Aldrich. Carbendazim solutions were carefully prepared by dissolving carbendazim \n\non the zebrafish water system. Ten millilitres of each tested concentration was sampled at \n\nthe beginning and at the end of the assay and preserved at -20 \u00baC for further chemical \n\nanalysis. The chemical analysis aimed to assess the degradation of carbendazim in the test \n\nsolutions and was performed at Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry and Biochemistry, \n\nUniversity of South Bohemia in ?esk\u00e9 Bud?jovice, Czech Republic.  \n\n \n\n2.3 Embryo assay \n\nThe assay was based on the OECD testing guideline 236 on Fish Embryo Acute \n\nToxicity (FET) Test (OECD, 2013). The embryos (approximately 3 hpf) previously \n\nselected were exposed to carbendazim concentrations ranging from 1.1 to 1.8 mg/L. Ten \n\neggs in triplicate per treatment were distributed individually in 24-wells microplates. Test \n\nrun for 96 h. Embryos were daily observed under a stereomicroscope (Stereoscopic Zoom \n\nMicroscope \u2013 SMZ 1500, Nikon Corporation, Japan) and the following parameters were \n\nevaluated: survival, somite formation, incidence of pericardial edema, heart beat, \n\nmalformations (general, spinal, tail and head), hatching, body length (total length: snout to \n\ntail tip), yolk sac length and developmental delay. The heart beat (beats/15s) was measured \n\nby counting heart beats under a stereomicroscope in 3 randomly selected embryos of each \n\nreplicate (n=9 per concentration) at 48 h. The body and yolk sac length was measured \n\nusing digital images of the embryos with the software NIS Elements D (Nikon \n\nCorporation, Tokyo, Japan). Development delay was obtained by matching the \n\ndevelopmental stage of a given embryo with the developmental stages defined by Kimmel \n\net al., (1995).  \n\nA sublethal range of carbendazim concentrations (0.00016, 0.0008, 0.004, 0.020, \n\n0.1 and 0.5 mg/L) was used to set up the test for biochemical determinations and \n\nlocomotory analysis. This test was deployed in the same conditions as the above described \n\ntest. At 96 hours of exposure, 10 clusters of eight larvae per treatment were snap-frozen in \n\n\n\nCarbendazim effects on zebrafish embryos \n\n127 \n\n \n\nmicrotubes containing 0.8 ml of K-phosphate buffer (0.1M, pH 7.4) and stored at - 80 \u00ba C \n\nfor further enzymatic analysis (see section 2.4). For locomotory assay larvae were \n\ntransferred to 96 well plates and analysed using the track system Zebrabox (Viewpoint, \n\nLyon, France) at 120 h (see section 2.5).  \n\n \n\n2.4 Biomarkers determinations \n\nEnzymatic assays were performed to analyse cholinesterase (ChE), glutathione-S-\n\ntransferase (GST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and catalase (CAT) in larvae of zebrafish. \n\nEnzymatic determinations were made spectrophotometrically (Thermo Scientific \n\nMultiskan Spectrum, USA) using 96 wells microplates. On the day of enzymatic analyses, \n\nsamples were defrosted on ice, homogenised (KIKA Labortechnik U2005 Control) and \n\ncentrifuged (4 \u00baC, 10000 g, 20 min) in order to isolate the post-mitochondrial supernatant \n\n(PMS) posteriorly used as enzyme extract for enzymatic activity determination.  \n\nThe methods for the determination of ChE, GST and LDH activity is described in \n\nDomingues et al. (2010). Briefly, ChE activity was determined at 414 nm according to the \n\nmethod of Ellman et al. (1961) adapted for microplate (Guilhermino et al., 1996). GST \n\nactivity was performed at 340 nm as described by Habig and Jakoby (1981) adapted to \n\nmicroplate reader (Frasco and Guilhermino, 2002). The LDH activity was continuously \n\nmonitored for 5 min at 340 nm, following the methodology described by Vassault (1983) \n\nwith the modifications introduced by Diamantino et al. (2001). The CAT activity was \n\nmeasured at 240 nm in spectrophotometer quartz cell by monitoring the decrease of \n\nabsorbance due to decomposition of H2O2, as described by Clairborne (1985). \n\nProtein quantification in samples was performed in quadruplicate according to the \n\nBradford method (Bradford, 1976), at 595 nm, using ?- globulin to determine standard \n\ncurve. Enzymatic activity units were expressed in nanomoles of substrate hydrolyzed per \n\nminute per mg of protein. A Labsystem Multiskan EX microplate (Labsystems Inc., \n\nFranklin, MA) reader was used to determine all protein and enzymatic activity.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCarbendazim effects on zebrafish embryos \n\n128 \n\n \n\n2.5 Analysis of locomotor response  \n\nZebrafish larvae were used to assess the effects of carbendazim on locomotory \n\nactivity.  At 120 hpf the embryos were removed from the exposure dishes and placed in 96 \n\nwell plates (one per well). Locomotion was evaluated for 12 embryos per treatment in \n\ntriplicate including the control. Prior to the assessment of behaviour, dead larvae or larvae \n\nthat exhibited physical abnormalities were discarded and not included in analyses. \n\nEmbryonic movement was tracked using the Zebrabox (Viewpoint, Lyon, France) tracking \n\nsystem using a 25 frame per second infrared camera over a period of 50 min. The \n\ntemperature was maintained stable at 26 \u00b1 1 \u00baC. Movement was stimulated by applying \n\nlight:dark intervals according to what was previously described in Irons et al (2010).  \n\nBriefly, the test consisted of acclimating the embryos in the light for 10 min, followed by a \n\ncycle of four alternating periods of light:dark intervals (10 min dark; 10 min ligth; 10 min \n\ndark; 10 min ligth). Typically zebrafish larvae show less locomotion during light periods \n\nand more during dark. For each replicate the distances moved in 2-minute time intervals \n\nwere recorded separately for each dark and light period.  \n\nIn this study the following parameters were calculated for each time interval except \n\nacclimation period that was not included in the analysis: total distance moved, relative \n\nsmall and large distance moved and relative swimming time. The total distance consists of \n\nthe total swimming distance of the larvae during each measurement period. The relative \n\nsmall distance (%) is the ratio between small distance moved and total distance moved in \n\neach 10 min period. The relative large distance (%) is the ratio between large distance and \n\nthe total distance moved in each measurement period. Finally, the relative swimming time \n\nrefers to the time embryos spend moving (swimming) relative to the total measurement \n\nperiod. A threshold of 30 was used for background correction and a movement was \n\nconsidered \u201csmall\u201d when individuals moved less than 0.5 mm/sec. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCarbendazim effects on zebrafish embryos \n\n129 \n\n \n\n2.6. Determination of Carbendazim in water using liquid chromatography-tandem \n\nmass spectrometry \n\n2.6.1. Chemicals \n\nLiquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC-MS) grade methanol and \n\nacetonitrile (Li Chrosolv Hypergrade) were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). \n\nFormic acid used to acidify the mobile phases was purchased from Labicom (Olomouc, \n\nCzech Republic). Ultra-pure water was produced using an Aqua-MAX-Ultra System \n\n(Younglin, Kyounggi-do, Korea). All compounds used were analytical standards or of high \n\npurity (> 98%). 13C6 labeled trimethoprim was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Inc. \n\n(Andover, MA, USA) and it was used as internal standard because it has quite similar \n\nretention time as carbendazim (elution time is 4.98 min for carbendazim and 5.35 min for \n\nlabeled trimethoprim). \n\nStock solutions of carbendazim and labeled trimethoprim were prepared in \n\nmethanol at a concentration of 1 mg\u00b7mL-1 and stored at -20\u00b0C. A spiking mixture was \n\nprepared for each compound by diluting stocks in methanol to concentration of 1 ?g/mL \n\nand stored at -20\u00b0C. \n\n \n\n2.6.2. LC-MS/MS analysis \n\n A triple stage quadrupole MS/MS TSQ Quantum Ultra mass spectrometer (Thermo \n\nFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) coupled with an Accela 1250 LC pump (Thermo \n\nFisher Scientific) and an HTS XT-CTC autosampler (CTC Analytics AG, Zwingen, \n\nSwitzerland) was used for analysis of carbendazim in water samples. Thawed water \n\nsamples were filtered through a syringe filter (0.45 ?m, regenerated cellulose, Labicom, \n\nOlomouc, Czech Republic), after that 10 ng of internal standard was added to 1 mL of \n\nsample. \n\nAn analytical Cogent Bidentate C18 column (50 mm x 2.1 mm ID x 4 \u00b5m particles, \n\nThermo Fisher Scientific) was used for chromatographic separation of the target analytes. \n\nIonization of targeted compounds was carried out with heated electrospray ionization \n\n(HESI). The spray voltage was 3.5 kV. Nitrogen (purity > 99.999%) was used as the sheath \n\ngas (40 arbitrary units), auxiliary gas (10 arbitrary units) and collision gas. The vaporizer \n\n\n\nCarbendazim effects on zebrafish embryos \n\n130 \n\n \n\nwas heated to 250\u00b0C and the capillary to 350\u00b0C. Chromatographic separation of targeted \n\nanalytes was provided with acidified acetonitrile/ultrapure water gradient presented in the \n\nTable S1 (Supplementary data). \n\nTwo product ions from carbendazim 192?159, used for quantification, and \n\n192?131, used for qualification, were monitored in positive ion mode during analysis. \n\nDeveloped method was validated in the range of tested concentrations. The method \n\nshowed good linearity in the concentration range from 0.001 to 1 mg/L for carbendazim \n\nwith R2=0.998. Recovery of carbendazim from aquaria water was evaluated by spiking \n\nwater samples with the target compound. Recovery value for carbendazim was 100%. The \n\naverage carbendazim limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.00016 mg/L and was calculated \n\nas one quarter of the lowest calibration point in the calibration curve where relative \n\nstandard deviation of average response factor was &lt;30%. \n\nMatrix-matched standard response was used as factors for correcting the response \n\nderived from the calibration curve. Matrix-matched standard was prepared from tested \n\nwater blank by spiking with both internal standard and native compound at 0.01 mg/L and \n\n1 mg/L, respectively. \n\n \n\n2.7 Statistical analysis \n\nLethal concentration (LCx) and effect concentration (ECx) values were calculated \n\nfor each endpoint by fitting dose-response curves using the package drc in the software R \n\n(R Core Team, 2014). For locomotor behaviour a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) \n\nwas used to test differences between the different treatments among each of the light dark \n\ninterval, except the acclimation period that was not included in the analysis. In the case \n\ndatasets failed the normality and homoscedasticity test, an ANOVA on ranks (Kruskall-\n\nWallis) was performed. When significant, differences were further explored with \n\nappropriate post hoc test (Dunnet\u2019s or Dunn\u2019s) to compare each treatment against control. \n\nTest statistics and analysis of normality were conducted using the software SigmaPlot \n\nV.12.5 (SysStat, San Jose, California, USA). A significance level of 0.05 was used to infer \n\nstatistically significant results. The relationship between the different \n\ntreatments/concentrations of carbendazin and the overall behavioural and biochemical \n\nendpoints was investigated by a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Behavioural and \n\n\n\nCarbendazim effects on zebrafish embryos \n\n131 \n\n \n\nbiomarkers data were standardized (scaled into 0-1 range), in order to be used in the same \n\nordination plot. PCA was performed using CANOCO 4.5 software (Lep\u0161 and \u0160milauer, \n\n2003). \n\n3. Results \n\n3.1 Stability of carbendazim in the exposure medium \n\nChemical analysis of the exposure media showed stable exposure concentrations \n\nand within 80 \u2013 120% of the nominal concentrations in what refers the FET test (1.1 \u2013 1.8 \n\nmg/L). However, analysis of the exposure media of the sublethal range of concentrations \n\n(0.00016 \u2013 0.5 mg/L) revealed some inconsistencies (Table S1, Supplementary data) \n\nprobably because the tested concentrations were very close to the limit of quantification.  \n\n3.2 Effects on embryos development \n\nThe calculated LC50 and EC50 values for zebrafish embryos exposed to \n\ncarbendazim are presented in Table 1. Carbendazim showed to be moderate to highly toxic \n\nto zebrafish embryos as can be observed in Fig S1, with a 96 h-LC50 of 1.76 mg/L (Table \n\n1).   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCarbendazim effects on zebrafish embryos \n\n132 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Effects of Carbendazim on the developmental parameters of zebrafish embryos.

Although carbendazim did not cause significant mortality at 24 hpf, embryos \n\nexposed to concentrations above 1.3 mg/L exhibited developmental anomalies such as tail \n\nand spine deformities presenting an EC50 of 1.48 mg/L (Table 1). At 48 hpf an increment in \n\nthe frequency of edemas and spine curvature was observed with a EC50 of 1.26 mg/L and \n\n1.53 mg/L respectively (Table 1, Fig S2 a and b). Moreover, carbendazim induced a \n\nsignificant reduction in heart beat rate affecting even embryos exposed to the lowest \n\nconcentration of 1 mg/L. Embryos exposed to control exhibited a heart beat around 180 \n\nbeats/min while embryos exposed to the highest concentrations presented a heart beat rate \n\naround 100 beats/min (Table 1, Fig S2 c).  \n\nAt 72 hpf besides the increase in malformations, carbendazim reduced hatching rate \n\nin exposed embryos. The calculated 72 h-EC50 was 1.57 mg/L (Table 1, Fig S3 a). \n\nConcerning body anomalies the calculated 72 h-EC50 were 1.52, 1.52 and 1.46 respectively \n\nfor head, tail and spine deformities (Table 1, Fig 3). The most important anomalies found \n\nwere head and eye malformation, and spine curvature as can be observed in Fig 1 A-F. \n\nMoreover, carbendazim caused an increase in edema formation (mainly pericardial edema, \n\nsee Fig S3 b and Fig 1 B, C and D) and the calculated 72 h-EC50 was 1.24 mg/L.  \n\nThe same effects described above were still observed at 96 hpf (Fig S4), including \n\nhatching (96 h-EC50 =1.62 mg/L) where only around 50% of embryos exposed to \n\ncarbendazim concentrations above 1.5 mg/L have hatched (Fig S4 a) and head, tail and \n\nspine deformities (96 h-EC50 = 1.53, 1.54 and 1.46 respectively) as can be observed in \n\nTable 1, Fig S4 b, d and f and Fig 1 G-I.  In relation to pericardial edema embryos exposed \n\nto concentrations above 1 mg/L were severely affected (96 h-EC50 = 1.08 mg/L, Table 1, \n\nFig S4 c). In addition, carbendazim significantly affected body and yolk sac length of \n\nembryos as can be observed in Table 1 and Fig. S4 e. The body length of embryos \n\ndecreased as carbendazim concentrations increased and embryos were affected even in the \n\nlowest concentration tested. The body length of control embryos was around 3.5 mm while \n\nexposed embryos showed body length around 3.0 mm. In contrast a significant increase \n\nwas observed in yolk sac length in concentrations above 1.30 mg/L which may be related \n\nto a delay in the consumption of the yolk.  \n\n\n\nCarbendazim effects on zebrafish embryos \n\n134 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig 1 \u2013 Zebrafish embryos abnormalities during exposure to carbendazim.

Although an effect was observed for these parameters, they do not \n\npresent a dose-response pattern. Generally, in the dark periods, organisms exposed to \n\nintermediate concentrations of carbendazim presented lower percentages of small distance \n\nmovements (and higher % of large distance movements) when compared to control, Fig 3 c \n\nand e. In the light period only organisms exposed to the highest concentration presented a \n\ndifferentiated behaviour compared to control, translated by a decreased percentage of small \n\ndistance movements (and increased % of large distance movement), Fig 3 d and f.  In \n\nrelation to the relative swimming time, larvae exposed to carbendazim presented a longer \n\nswimming time when compared to control group in both dark (F= 27.44; P=&lt;0.001) and \n\nlight (H= 47.30; P=&lt;0.001) (Fig 3 g-h). This effect was concentrations dependent and \n\ndifferences could be perceived even at the lowest concentrations tested either for dark or \n\nfor light periods. \n\n \n\n3.5 PCA \n\nIn the PCA related to the light period (Figure 4-A), the first two ordination axes \n\nexplained 72.2% of the total variation. The primary axis represented 55.4% of the variation \n\nand described an increase on the activity of all the measured biomarkers and also \n\nswimming time (ST) along with the decrease of total swimming distance (TD). Higher \n\nenzymatic activity and longer swimming time are related with higher concentration of \n\ncarbendazim, while control samples and lower concentrations of the chemical are related \n\nwith greater swimming distance. The second axis explained a variation of 16.8% and \n\ndescribed a gradient of increasing percentage of long distance swimming but there was no \n\nclear pattern between these behaviour parameter and carbendazim concentrations.     \n\nThe PCA for the Dark period (Figure 4-B) presented an overall similar pattern. The \n\nfirst two axes represented 75.0% of the total observed variation. Primary variation captured \n\n53.1% of the global variation and described an increase of the enzymatic activity, followed \n\nby swimming time (ST). Again, the increase of these parameters is associated to higher \n\nconcentrations of carbendazim.  Secondary axis, that explains 21.9% of the total variation, \n\n\n\nCarbendazim effects on zebrafish embryos \n\n138 \n\n \n\ndescribes an increase in both total distance (TD) and large distance percentage (LD), but \n\nwithout a clear relationship with carbendazim concentrations.     \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 4 \u2013 Biplot of the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) performed on different concentrations of \ncarbendazim (symbols). The ordination was made in relation to behaviour endpoints TD (Total distance), LD \n(Large distance) and ST (Swimming time) and biochemical (GST, LDH, ChE, CAT) response variables \n(arrows). \n\n \n\n4. Discussion \n\nOur study revealed effects of carbendazim at developmental, biochemical and \n\nbehavioural levels. Lethality of carbendazim to zebrafish embryos did not increase with \n\ntime and was fully established after 48 h of exposure. This is probably due to the mode of \n\naction of carbendazim that inhibits the assembly of tubulin and the formation of \n\nmicrotubules in fungi, and also in mammals (Davidse, 1986; Ireland et al., 1979; Lim and \n\nMiller, 1997). For instance, the lethal effects of carbendazim in Clawed frog (Xenopus \n\nlaevis) at 4-cell stage embryos proved to be higher than in embryos exposed later in \n\nblastula stage as concluded by Yoon et al., (2008). In our study, zebrafish embryos were \n\nexposed as early as 2 - 3 hpf and possibly, the establishment of toxicity at the first 48 h is \n\nthe result of carbendazim inhibition of microtubule assembly and mitosis in the early \n\nembryonic stages. One of the few studies conducted in fish early life stages available also \n\ndemonstrated that carbendazim strongly affected survival of Prussian carp (Carassius \n\ngibelio) embryos by causing 100% of mortality after 24 h of exposure to 0.216 mg/L \n\n\n\nCarbendazim effects on zebrafish embryos \n\n139 \n\n \n\n(Ludwikowska et al., 2013). Fingerlings of Milkfish (Chanos chanos) exposed to \n\ncarbendazim showed a 96 h-LC50 of 0.013 mg/L (Palanikumar et al., 2014) which is very \n\nlow compared to the one found in this study for zebrafish embryos (1.75 mg/L). Another \n\nstudy conducted in Tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) alevins showed a 96 h-LC50 of \n\n4.16 mg/L (Rico et al., 2011).  \n\nFurthermore, carbendazim exposure strongly affected the development of embryos \n\nby triggering a series of developmental anomalies (spine curvature, head deformity), \n\ndecreasing heart rate and body length; increasing pericardial edemas and delaying yolk sac \n\nconsumption and hatching. This is consistent with studies conducted in amphibian (Yoon \n\net al., 2008) and rodent embryos (Farag et al., 2011) where carbendazim showed to be \n\nteratogen increasing the incidence of malformations such as pericardial edema, spinal \n\nlordosis, elongated heart, narrowed head among others. The body length of Clawed frog \n\n(X. laevis) exposed to carbendazim were also shown to be significantly shorter at \n\nconcentrations ? 0.38 mg/L (Yoon et al., 2008). A previous study carried out with the \n\nparent compound of carbendazim (benomyl) in zebrafish embryos also showed to decrease \n\nhatching and heart rate and increase incidence of malformations  causing the same type of \n\nanomalies observed in our study in concentrations as low as 30 \u00b5g/L (Kim et al., 2009).  \n\nRegarding the effects of carbendazim on biomarkers, a significant induction of \n\nChE, GST and LDH activities was observed in exposed embryos. To the best of our \n\nknowledge, there is no study available which describes alterations in the enzymatic activity \n\nin zebrafish embryos caused by carbendazim. AChE plays an important role in \n\nneurotransmission being responsible for the hydrolysis of acetyltiocholine at the \n\ncholinergic synapses and neuromuscular junction (Olsen et al., 2001). In addition, several \n\nstudies have pointed out evidences of AChE being involved in other physiological process \n\nincluding the participation in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis as reviewed \n\nby Jiang &amp; Zhang (2008). A recent study conducted in zebrafish has demonstrated that \n\nembryonic exposure to different carbendazim concentrations ranging from 0.004 to 0.5 \n\nmg/L lead to significant changes in the expressions of many genes that play critical roles \n\nduring cell apoptosis (Jiang et al., 2014). However, the mechanisms that regulate AChE \n\nexpression and participation in apoptosis are not fully understood yet (Soreq and Seidman, \n\n2001; Zhang et al., 2002). Considering apoptosis is related to up regulation of \n\nacetylcholinesterase genes (Zhang et al., 2002), the overexpression of ChE activity in \n\n\n\nCarbendazim effects on zebrafish embryos \n\n140 \n\n \n\nzebrafish embryos observed in our study is probably linked to carbendazim potential to \n\ninduce cell apoptosis. \n\nGST activity was also induced after exposure to carbendazim. GST represent a \n\nfamily of enzymes with a central role in the biotransformation of xenobiotics and \n\nendogenic compounds and their activity can be enhanced in response to xenobiotics which \n\nmake them a stress indicator that have been increasingly used as an environmental \n\nbiomarker (Hyne and Maher, 2003). GST induction has also been observed following \n\ncarbendazim and benomyl exposure (parent compound of carbendazim) in a midge species \n\n(Kiefferulus calligaster) and in adult Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) (Domingues et \n\nal., 2009; Min and Kang, 2008) respectively. \n\nSimilarly, LDH activity was induced in embryos exposed to carbendazim. LDH is a \n\nkey enzyme in the anaerobic pathway of energy production and is involved in the \n\ncarbohydrate metabolism (Diamantino et al., 2001). Increased LDH activity levels have \n\nbeen observed in conditions of chemical stress when high levels of energy are required as \n\ndemonstrated in Nile tilapia exposed to benomyl, the parent compound of carbendazim \n\n(Min and Kang, 2008). It is possible that a metabolic hypoxia due to detoxification process \n\nincreases the anaerobic pathways causing the LDH induction. Our results showed no effect \n\nof carbendazim in the activity of CAT, indicating that the antioxidant response was not \n\nactivated. This agrees with the current knowledge since oxidative stress is not pointed out \n\nas a mechanism of action of carbendazim.  \n\nIn our study, the locomotor response of zebrafish embryos was sensitive to the \n\neffects of embryonic exposure to carbendazim as observed by alterations in swimming \n\nactivity of larvae even at the lowest tested concentration (0.00016 mg/L). Organisms \n\nexposed to carbendazim, spent more time swimming, either in the dark as in the light \n\nperiod. However, in both cases the increment of time spent swimming was not translated in \n\nan increment of the distance moved (meaning that organisms swam slower). In the light \n\nperiods, unexpectedly, the total distance moved even decreased, suggesting that fish were \n\nnot able to swim at their regular speed probably due to energy depletion or energy \n\nallocated to other physiological processes to cope with chemical stress or due to \n\ndevelopmental impairment in key processes for the locomotion. To our knowledge the only \n\nstudy available concerning carbendazim effects on fish behaviour is the recent study \n\nconducted in juveniles of the African sharptooth catfish (Claria gariepinus). Fish exposed \n\n\n\nCarbendazim effects on zebrafish embryos \n\n141 \n\n \n\nto sublethal concentrations of carbendazim (0.22 \u2013 0.43 mg/L) showed abnormal \n\nbehavioural responses such as spiral swimming, hyperactivity, frequent surfacing to gulp \n\nwater, jerky movement and loss of equilibrium. The authors attributed this altered \n\nbehaviour to the toxic action of carbendazim and its effect on the nervous system of \n\nexposed fish (Nwani et al., 2015).  \n\nBehaviour effects measured as swimming time, are associated in the PCA, to the \n\nbiochemical parameters ChE, GST and LDH. While ChE is probably involved in apoptose \n\nmechanism as suggested above, the GST and LDH, being general biomarkers of chemical \n\nand environmental stress, suggest that the metabolic cost involved on detoxification \n\nprocesses may be compromising other important functions such as behaviour including the \n\nlocomotor response of zebrafish larvae. Results of previous study in fish exposed to copper \n\nrelated the partitioning of energy utilization (between metabolism maintenance and \n\nlocomotion) to altered fish behaviour (Handy et al., 1999), corroborating this hypothesis.  \n\nChanges on fish behaviour may also be caused by disruption of the hormonal \n\nsystem. Many studies have shown the correlations between endocrine disruption and \n\nabnormal behaviour in fish (Bell, 2001; Clotfelter et al., 2004; S\u00e1rria et al., 2011). \n\nActually, behaviour has been proposed as an endpoint in the environmental risk assessment \n\nof endocrine disrupter chemicals (S\u00e1rria et al., 2011). As demonstrated by Jiang et al., \n\n(2014) carbendazim had the potential to induce endocrine disruption in zebrafish embryo. \n\nTheir results showed that carbendazim exposure caused down regulation of estrogen \n\nreceptors and also decreased vitellogenin (used as a biomarker indicator of endocrine \n\ndisruption) expression at concentrations as low as 0.004 mg/L. The altered locomotor \n\nbehaviour of zebrafish larvae observed in our study which used a similar range of \n\ncarbendazim concentrations as Jiang and colleagues (0.004 \u2013 0.5 mg/L),  may also be \n\ncorrelated to the effects of carbendazim on the endocrine system. However, our results \n\nshowed that carbendazim affects behaviour even at lower concentrations (0.00016 mg/L).  \n\n \n\n\n\nCarbendazim effects on zebrafish embryos \n\n142 \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 5- Diagram comparing the relative sensitivity of endpoints used in the present work to assess \neffects of carbendazim in Danio rerio embryos. Values between brackets are Lowest Observed \nEffect Concentrations (LOEC). \n\n \n\nFrom an ecological point of view, the alterations in the swimming behaviour \n\n(which were observed at environmental relevant concentrations) can have important \n\nconsequences for the fitness of the organisms as they can further originate feeding \n\ndisruption (capability to capture prey) and increase vulnerability to predation (through an \n\ninability to remain inconspicuous) among other processes which may poses serious risks to \n\nthe success of fish populations (Little and Finger, 1990). From Fig 5, which summarizes \n\nthe Lowest Observed Effect Concentrations of the several endpoints analyzed in this work, \n\none can easily observe that behavioural endpoints are several orders of magnitude more \n\nsensitive than developmental parameters and thus have the potential to work as an early \n\nwarning signal for environmental stress. Further studies should focus on understanding \n\nhow the behavioural disturbances measured translate into fitness impairment at the adult \n\nstage.  \n\n \n\n\n\nCarbendazim effects on zebrafish embryos \n\n143 \n\n \n\n5. Conclusion \n\nTo our knowledge, this was the first study to evaluate the effects of carbendazim at \n\ndevelopmental, biochemical and behavioural levels in zebrafish early life stages. Data \n\nshowed that carbendazim affects embryos survival and development causing a series of \n\nanomalies including pericardial edemas, body and tail deformities, decreased heart rate and \n\nbody length among others. At the sublethal level, carbendazim induced alterations in ChE, \n\nGST and LDH activities. And at behaviour level caused increase in swimming times, but \n\nnot increased swimming distances. Locomotory behaviour showed to be several orders of \n\nmagnitude more sensitive that developmental parameters or lethality, highlighting the \n\npotential of behavioural endpoints as early warning signs for environmental stress. Since \n\nbehavioural endpoints may translate in ecological relevant effects such as feeding \n\nbehaviour of antipredatory behaviour disruption, these findings corroborate the importance \n\nof the emergent field of behavioural ecotoxicology as a relevant approach in ecological \n\nrisk assessment strategies. \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThis study was supported by a PhD grant (SFRH/BD/74501/2010) attributed to Thayres \n\nAndrade and by the Post-Doc grant (SFRH/BPD/90521/2012) attributed to In\u00eas \n\nDomingues by the Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation (FCT), funding by \n\nFEDER through COMPETE and Programa Operacional Factores de Competitividade and \n\nby National funding through FCT, within the research project Climatox\u2014Impact of \n\nclimatic changes on toxicity of pollutants (Ref.

Soares and In\u00eas Domingues \n\nThis chapter is in preparation to be submitted as an original article in: \n\nAquatic Toxicology \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nThere are strong evidences that the climate is globally changing.  These changes are \nexpected to modify water quality mainly by alterations in environmental parameters such \nas temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen. Slight shifts in these environmental factors may \ncompromise the physiological performance of aquatic organisms and their capacity of \nresponse to additional stress.  In natural systems, organisms are very often are forced to \ncope with environmental and chemical stress simultaneously. Understanding how the \nenvironmental changes may determine the physiological response of aquatic life and \ninteract with contaminants, must be considered in risk assessment. Therefore, in the \npresent study, we aimed at assessing the joint effects of pH (acid and alkaline) and carbaryl \nto zebrafish embryos.In ecotoxicology, the prediction of combined effects is normally \nbased on the effects of the individual components of the mixture by using the well-known \npharmacological concepts of concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA). The \ntoxicity of the binary combination was determined using the fish embryo toxicity test with \nzebrafish. Results showed that for the acid range the observed mixture toxicity was rather \nwell predicted by CA. The median lethal concentration (LC50) of the mixture was predicted \nwith an error of only 8%. Considering the alkaline range, both concepts underestimate the \nLC50 by a factor of 3 for CA and by a factor of 4.6 for IA. The increased toxicity of the \ncombination of alkaline pH and carbaryl was likely due to the hydrolysis of carbaryl at \nelevated pH values generating the more toxic product 1-naphthol. Our results highlight the \nnecessity of incorporating the effects of environmental factors such as pH in risk \nassessment procedures, in order to avoid underestimation of effects and adequately protect \naquatic organisms. \n\nKeywords: carbamate pesticides, Danio rerio, concentration addition, independent action, \nmixtures. \n\n\n\n  Influence of pH on the toxicity of carbaryl \n\n161 \n\n \n\n1. Introduction  \n\nCurrently, for the risk assessment of chemicals, aquatic toxicity tests are conducted \n\naccording to established standard protocols where physicochemical \u2013 temperature, pH and \n\netc. \u2013 conditions are maintained stable according to requirements for a given test species. \n\nMoreover, the risk management primarily focuses on the assessment of single/individual \n\nstressors while in the environment organisms are rather exposed to multiple mixtures of \n\nstressors (Altenburger and Greco, 2009). Furthermore, the problematic of climate change \n\nand global warming raises the idea that organism and biological systems may have to cope \n\nwith multiple stressors including nonchemical adverse factors such as unfavorable pH, \n\ntemperature and salinity in combination with chemical stress.  \n\npH is one of the most determinant parameters for any chemical reaction and has \n\nbeen pointed out as the most important factor conditioning survival and fitness of many \n\nfreshwater species. Variations in pH showed to have a significant impact on survival, \n\nhatching success, reproduction, pigmentation, swimming performance behaviour and body \n\nchemistry of both fish and invertebrate aquatic species (Fromm, 1980; Haines, 1981; \n\nHavas and Rosseland, 1995; Ikuta et al., 2000; Jordahl and Benson, 1987; Lechleitner et \n\nal., 1985; Okland and Okland, 1986; Ye and Randall, 1991). The effects of pH on the \n\ntoxicity of chemical stressors have also been explored in the past decades, however, the \n\nmajority of studies focuses mainly on metals and phenols toxicity (Bervoets and Blust, \n\n2000; Dave, 1985; Dietrich and Schlatter, 1989; Grosell et al., 2006; Reader et al., 1989; \n\nStouthart et al., 1996). Nevertheless, the toxicity of pesticides is also affected by pH \n\n(Mayer and Ellersieck, 1986) and only few studies evaluating the combined effects of these \n\ntwo stressors are available.  \n\nMayer &amp; Ellersieck (1986) reviewed the effects of pH and other physicochemical \n\nfactors on chemical toxicity and reported that of any toxicity modifying factor tested, pH \n\ncaused the greatest average change in chemical toxicity (in 96 h-LC50\u2019s). According to the \n\nstudies reviewed, the toxicity of pesticides tended to increase due to the formation of more \n\ntoxic hydrolysis products at high pH as in the specific case of mexacarbate zectarn, which \n\nwas found to be 38 times more toxic at pH 9.5. Therefore, the effects of physicochemical \n\nfactors such as pH, should be considered in hazard assessment in order to assess risk \n\naccurately and protect aquatic biota avoiding under or overestimation of effects. Within \n\n\n\n  Influence of pH on the toxicity of carbaryl \n\n162 \n\n \n\nthis context, the present study aimed at investigating the influence of pH (acid and \n\nalkaline) on the toxicity of carbaryl to zebrafish embryos. \n\nIn aquatic toxicology, our current understanding of mixture toxicity is adopted from \n\npharmacology and it is based on the concepts of concentration addition (CA) (Loewe and \n\nMuischnek, 1926) and independent action (IA) (Bliss, 1939). These two concepts are based \n\non the assumption that the composition of the mixture is known and are capable of \n\npredicting the toxicity of the mixture from the toxicity of the individual components \n\n(Altenburger and Greco, 2009). The concept of CA has been introduced by Loewe &amp; \n\nMuischnek (1926) and is based on the assumption that the components of a given mixture \n\nact in the same way, by the same mechanisms (Groten, 2000). CA is mathematically \n\nexpressed as: \n\n= 1 \n\nwhere  is the number of mixture components,  is the concentration of the th \n\nmixture component that provokes x% of effect when applied singly, and  is the \n\nconcentration of the respective component in the mixture. In contrast, the concept of IA is \n\nbased on the idea that the compounds of a given mixture/combination have dissimilar \n\nmodes of action and is mathematically expressed as follows: \n\n( ) = ( + ? + ) = 1 ? [1 ? ( )] \n\nwhere ( ) denotes the predicted effect (scaled from 0 to 1) of an -compound \n\nmixture,  is the concentration of the th compound, and ( ) is the effect of that \n\nconcentration if the stressor is applied singly.  \n\nBoth concepts have been extensively used to study binary and multiple mixtures of \n\nvarious chemicals, using different organisms and endpoints demonstrating their predictive \n\npower (Altenburger et al., 2000; Backhaus et al., 2000; Deneer, 2000; Kortenkamp, 2007). \n\nFor example, in the study of Altenburger et al., (2000), CA has been successfully used to \n\npredict the toxicity of 16 similarly and specifically acting chemicals and showed to have an \n\n(1) \n\n(2) \n\n\n\n  Influence of pH on the toxicity of carbaryl \n\n163 \n\n \n\nexcellent predictive power. Likewise, independent action showed to have an excellent \n\npredictive power when used to predict the toxicity of chemicals with dissimilar modes of \n\naction (Backhaus et al., 2000; Faust et al., 2003). In this study, these two concepts were \n\nused to predict the combined toxicity of pH (acid or alkaline) and carbaryl to zebrafish \n\nembryos and to detect deviations to the expected toxicity. \n\n2. Materials and Methods \n\n2.1 Test organisms \n\nAll the organisms (zebrafish embryos) used in this study were obtained from the \n\nzebrafish facility established at the Department of Biology, University of Aveiro \n\n(Portugal). Adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were maintained in a ZebTEC (Tecniplast, \n\nBuguggiate, Italy) recirculating system. Culture water was obtained through reverse \n\nosmosis and activated carbon filtration of tap water, complemented with 0.34 mg/L salt \n\n(\u201cInstant Ocean Synthetic Sea Salt\u201d, Spectrum Brands, USA) and automatically adjusted \n\nfor pH and conductivity. Water temperature was 26.0 \u00b1 1 \u00baC, conductivity 750 \u00b1 50 \u00b5S, pH \n\n7.5 \u00b1 0.5 and dissolved oxygen equal or above 95 % saturation. A 16:8 h (light:dark) \n\nphotoperiod cycle was maintained. The adult fish were fed twice a day with commercially \n\navailable artificial diet (ZM-400 fish food; Zebrafish Management Ltd) and brine shrimp. \n\nEggs were obtained by breeding of fish in aquaria. The eggs collected were rinsed in water \n\nand checked under a stereomicroscope (Stereoscopic Zoom Microscope-SMZ 1500, Nikon \n\nCorporation). Eggs with cleavage irregularities, injuries or other kind of malformations \n\nwere discarded.  \n\nAll tests were performed similar as described in the OECD testing guideline 236 \n\n(OECD, 2013), in charcoal filtered and deionised water supplemented with 0.34 mg/L  sea \n\nsalt (see above) at 26 \u00b1 1 \u00baC and a 16:8 h (light:dark) photoperiod.  Exposure was \n\nconducted from 3 to 96 hpf. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  Influence of pH on the toxicity of carbaryl \n\n164 \n\n \n\n2.2 pH effects on zebrafish embryos  \n\nIn order to derive concentration response curves, zebrafish embryos were exposed \n\nto acid pH ranging from 3 to 7 (0.1 to 1000 \u00b5M of H3O+) and to alkaline pH ranging from \n\n8 to 12 (1 to 1000 \u00b5M of OH-). A set of buffers in concentrations ranging from 17- to 64-\n\nfold below concentrations that cause mortality (Fig S1, Supplementary Data (\u2018S\u2019 before the \n\nnumber indicates that the figure or table respectively is provided in the \u2018supplementary \n\ninformation\u2019)) were used to prevent pH drifts during the assay (Table S1). HCl and NaOH \n\n(1.0 N) solutions were used for pH adjustment; a portable multiparameter device \n\n(ProfiLine Multi 332) was used for pH measurements. Test solutions were daily renewed. \n\nEmbryos were exposed individually in 24-well plates for 96 h. For each test 10 embryos \n\nwere used per replica and a minimum of 3 replicates were used per treatment. Survival was \n\nobserved and registered daily until the end of the test.  \n\n \n\n2.3 Carbaryl effects on zebrafish embryos \n\nTo also derive concentration response curves for carbaryl, zebrafish embryos at 3 \n\nhpf were exposed to eight concentrations of 1, 1.6, 2.6, 4.3, 7.0, 11.4, 18.5 and 30 mg/L. \n\nTen eggs per treatment were distributed in 24-wells microplates in triplicate and run for \n\n96h. Embryos were observed daily under a stereomicroscope (Stereoscopic Zoom \n\nMicroscope \u2013 SMZ 1500, Nikon Corporation, Japan). Survival was evaluated daily until \n\nthe end of the assay at 96 h.  \n\n \n\n2.4 Combined exposure to carbaryl and pH \n\nOnce the LC50 values were calculated for the single exposures (pH and carbaryl \n\nseparately), the mixture experiments were conducted following a fixed ratio design. For \n\nthis, pH was converted into concentrations of ions H3O+ for acid and OH- for alkaline \n\nrange. Therefore, the two stressors were mixed in a ratio corresponding to 50:50% of \n\neffect. The mixture ratio was kept constant and the total concentration of the mixture was \n\n\n\n  Influence of pH on the toxicity of carbaryl \n\n165 \n\n \n\nvaried in order to describe experimentally the complete concentration-response \n\nrelationship of the mixture. For acid range only the MES buffer (4 mM) was used to avoid \n\npH drifts likewise, for basic range, only CAPS buffer (22 mM) was used (please refer to \n\nSupplementary data). We aimed at using one buffer for the acid and one buffer for the \n\nbasic pH range - albeit the buffers may have a limiting buffer capacity in part of the pH \n\nrange (in order to avoid drifts, the test solutions were daily renewed). The advantage of \n\nusing one buffer is that in mixture analysis and modelling only one buffer component \n\nwould need to be considered. In order to discard any interference of the buffers on the \n\ncombinations of acidic or alkaline pH and carbaryl, the tests were repeated using  buffers \n\nconcentrations 10 times higher (40 mM for MES and 220 mM for CAPS). Results are \n\npresented in the supplementary data Figs S2. The zebrafish embryos to the combinations \n\nfollowed the described in section 2.2 (pH effects on zebrafish embryos).  \n\n2.5-1-naphtol effects on embryos survival \n\n1-naphthol is the major hydrolysis product of carbaryl. As it has been proved that \n\ncarbaryl is highly susceptible to hydrolysis, we also tested the effects of 1-naphthol in \n\nzebrafish embryos in order to better understand the combined effects of pH and carbaryl. \n\nZebrafish embryos at 3 hpf were exposed to 1-naphthol concentrations ranging from 0.38 \n\nto 30 mg/L following the same procedure described in the section 2.3 (Carbaryl effects on \n\nzebrafish embryos).  \n\n2.6 Chemical analysis: analysis of carbaryl concentrations at different pH\u2019s \n\nIn order to check the stability of carbaryl under acidic and alkaline pH, chemical \n\nanalysis of the exposure medium were carried out. Ten millilitres of each combined \n\ntreatment were sampled at 0 and 24 h and preserved at -20 \u00baC until chemical analysis. The \n\nanalyses were performed at Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry and Biochemistry, \n\nUniversity of South Bohemia in ?esk\u00e9 Bud?jovice, Czech Republic. The results are \n\npresented in supplementary data (Table S2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  Influence of pH on the toxicity of carbaryl \n\n166 \n\n \n\n \n\n2.7 Data analysis \n\nBuffer LC50s could only be calculated for CAPS and CHES. For all other buffers \n\ntested the low mortality rates up to concentrations at the solubility limit did not allow \n\nobtaining LC50 values. For these buffers an ANOVA (one-way analysis of variance) with \n\nappropriate post hoc test (Dunnett\u2019s or Dunn\u2019s test) were conducted to potentially derive \n\nLOEC or NOEC values. The type of ANOVA (parametric or non-parametric) and post hoc \n\ntest was chosen depending on whether normality and homocedasticity of data were \n\ndemonstrated by analysis of the residuals with the Shapiro-Wilks test.  \n\nThe concentration-response relationships of the single stressors as well as of the \n\ncombinations were obtained by fitting dose-response curves using the software SigmaPlot \n\nV.12.5 (SysStat, San Jose, California,USA). Model choice decision was made based on the \n\nthe R2 and the estimated residual standard error. The concentration response relationships \n\nas well as the statistics and analysis of normality were conducted using the software \n\nSigmaPlot V.12.5 (SysStat, San Jose, California,USA) and a significance level of 0.05. \n\n \n\n2.7.1 Prediction of mixture toxicities \n\nFor the prediction of mixture toxicity the two well-known conceptual models CA \n\nand IA were used. The calculation of the mixture effects followed the procedures described \n\nin Backhaus et al 2000 and Altenburger et al 2000. To calculate the predictions by CA \n\nmodel, equation 1 was used as a starting point. As the ratio of the mixture components \n\n(H3O+/OH- and carbaryl) is quantitatively known, the concentration of each component can \n\nbe expressed as a fraction of the total concentration ( ).  Consequently, by rearranging \n\nEquation 1, the effect concentrations predicted by CA can be calculated as follows:  \n\n \n\n=  (3) \n\n\n\n  Influence of pH on the toxicity of carbaryl \n\n167 \n\n \n\n \n\nWhere  is the total concentration of the mixture provoking x% of effect and \n\n denotes de fraction of component  in the mixture. Using Equation 3, the total \n\nconcentrations of each mixture giving 1.5 to 99% effect were calculated and the resulting \n\nconcentration/effect pairs were connected by straight lines, providing a visualization of the \n\npredicted concentration-response curve.   \n\nTo calculate the mixture effects according to independent action, Equation 2 was \n\nrearranged so that the concentration response relationships  of the two individual \n\ncomponents of the mixture could be used to calculate their effects ( ) as follows: \n\n \n\n( ) =  1 ? [1 ? ( )] = 1 ? [1 ? ( )] \n\n \n\nAgain, the individual components of the mixture can be expressed as fractions, , \n\nof the total concentration, , therefore, the overall effect of the mixture concentration \n\ncan be calculated by rearranging Equation 4 as follows:  \n\n( ) = 1 ?  [1 ? ( )] = 1 ? [1 ? ( . )] \n\n \n\nUsing equation 5, the total concentration of the mixture provoking up to 100% of \n\neffect was calculated. The calculated concentration/effect pairs were connected by straight \n\nlines, providing a graphical representation of the predicted concentration response \n\nrelationship of the mixture predicted by independent action. To calculate an arbitrary effect \n\nconcentration  according to independent action, Equation 5 can be rewritten and \n\nunder the condition that total effect ( ) equals %,  is defined as \n\n(4) \n\n(5) \n\n\n\n  Influence of pH on the toxicity of carbaryl \n\n168 \n\n \n\n,therefore, the overall effect of any given total mixture concentration can be \n\ncalculated as:  \n\n% =  1 ? (1 ?  \n\n \n\nEquation 6, solved iteratively for a  that provokes an effect of %, implicitly \n\nprovides a prediction of effect concentrations of a mixture under the hypothesis of \n\nindependent action. \n\n3. Results \n\n3.1 Stability of carbaryl at acidic and alkaline pH \n\nIn order to check the stability of carbaryl, chemical analyses were performed for the \n\nwhole tested pH range. The analysis of the exposure media for acid condition showed \n\nstable exposure concentrations, remaining within 80 \u2013 120% of the nominal concentrations \n\nwith only two exception at pH 3.7 (129% of nominal concentration) and pH 4 (131% of \n\nnominal concentration). However, the measured concentrations were far below the nominal \n\nones varying from 0.002 to 32% of the nominal concentrations. At pH above 9.5 the \n\nnominal concentrations could not be detected been below the limit of quantification (Table \n\nS1, Supplementary data).  \n\n3.2 Single stressors toxicity \n\nClear dose-response relationships were observed in the single exposure experiment \n\nas can be observed in Fig. 1. The toxicities of each stressor are summarized in Table 1. The \n\npH effects were tested for both acidic and alkaline conditions (pH 3-7 and pH 7-12) \n\nEmbryos exposed to pH below 3.5 or above 10.5 showed a 100% of mortality. The \n\nobserved lethality was established within 24 hours and did not increase with prolonged \n\nexposure. For the acidic range, a 96 h-LC50 value of 225 \u00b1 16.6 \u00b5mol/L was determined \n\n(6) \n\n\n\n  Influence of pH on the toxicity of carbaryl \n\n169 \n\n \n\nand for the alkaline range, a 96 h-LC50 of 160 \u00b1 23.6 was calculated (Table 1). For carbaryl \n\na time and dose dependent relationship was observed with a 96 h-LC50 of 14.9 mg/L (Fig.1, \n\nTable 1).  \n\n \n\nFig 1 - Concentration-response curves of the single stressors experiments at 96 hpf: a) acid pH; \n(b) alkaline pH and (c) carbaryl.  \n\n a) Acid pH range\n\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\nS\nur\n\nvi\nva\n\nl (\n%\n\n)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n b) Alkaline pH range\n\npH value\n6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13\n\nS\nur\n\nvi\nva\n\nl (\n%\n\n)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nCarbaryl (\u00b5mol/L)\n1 10 100 1000\n\n%\n M\n\nor\nta\n\nlit\ny\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\nc) Carbaryl toxicity\n\n\n\n  Influence of pH on the toxicity of carbaryl \n\n170 \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3 Combined experiments \n\nAs stated in the methodology section, in order to discard any interference of the \n\nbuffers used to stabilize the pH on the combined toxicity tests, two assays were conducted \n\nincreasing 10 times the concentrations of the buffers used for acid and alkaline range. Fig. \n\nS2 shows the observed toxicity for acid range (MES concentration of 40 mM) and for \n\nalkaline range (CAPS concentration of 220 mM). When compared with the toxicities of \n\nassays using the lower buffer concentration (concentrations proved to have no toxicity to \n\nembryos) a slightly difference on the toxicity of 34% for MES and 35 % for CAPs was \n\nobserved. Moreover, the concentrations used of 4 mM and 22 mM are far below the ones \n\nthat pose risk to zebrafish embryos as demonstrated by the toxicity test conducted for each \n\nbuffer used in the combined experiments (Table S1, supplementary data). For MES, the \n\nconcentration of 4 mM is 64 fold less toxic than the established NOEC and for CAPS, the \n\nconcentration of 22 mM is 17 fold less toxic than the LC50. \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Parameters values of concentration-response relationships of the single and \ncombined experiments \n LC50 (\u00b5mol/L) \n  \nToxicity of the single mixture components  \n  \nAcid pH 225 \u00b1 16.6 \nAlkaline pH 160 \u00b1 23.6 \nCarbaryl 74.3 \u00b1 3.8 \n  \nToxicity of the Mixture  \n  \nAcid pH x Carbaryl \u2013 Observed effects 139 \u00b1 31.0 \nPredicted CA 150 \u00b1 8.9*10-2 \nPredicted IA 222 \u00b1 1.5 \n  \nAlkaline pH x Carbaryl \u2013 Observed effects 42.1 \u00b1 0.77 \nPredicted CA 124 \u00b1 0.12 \nPredicted IA 192 \u00b1 0.51 \n  \n\n \n\n\n\n  Influence of pH on the toxicity of carbaryl \n\n171 \n\n \n\nThe results of the combined toxicity of pH (acid or alkaline) and carbaryl as well as \n\nthe predictions made by CA and IA are shown in Fig. 2. Table 1 summarizes the \n\nconcentration-response relationships for mixture predictions and experimental \n\ndeterminations. For both pH ranges CA predicts higher mixture toxicity than IA as can be \n\nobserved in Fig. 2.  However, there is only a factor of ~1.5 between the LC50s predicted by \n\nCA (150 \u00b5mol/L for acid and 124 \u00b5mol/L for alkaline pH) and those predicted by IA (222 \n\n\u00b5mol/L for acid and 192 \u00b5mol/L for alkaline pH).  \n\nAs can be seen from Fig 2a in the case of acid range, the mixture toxicity is rather \n\nprecisely predicted by CA. The observed LC50 for the combination was 139 \u00b5mol/L, which \n\nis only a difference of 8% (a factor of 1.07) in relation to the predicted value of 150 \n\n\u00b5mol/L. In contrast the IA underestimates the combination of acid pH and carbaryl at the \n\nLC50 level. The LC50 predicted by IA was 222 \u00b5mol/L which is a difference of 60% (a \n\nfactor of 1.6) compared to the observed toxicity. \n\nRegarding the alkaline range, Fig 2b shows that both concepts underestimate the \n\ncombined toxicity. The observed LC50 for the combination was 42 \u00b5mol/L which is a \n\ndifference of 200% (a factor of 3.0) regarding the LC predicted by CA and a difference of \n\n356% (a factor of 4.6) regarding the one predicted by IA.  \n\nOverall, both concepts (CA better than IA) adequately estimated the joint-effects of \n\nacid pH and carbaryl if the components were mixed in the ratio of their respective LC50s. \n\nHowever, for the combination of alkaline pH and carbaryl, an increase in the toxicity was \n\nobserved due to the higher toxicity of the degradation product of carbaryl 1-naphthol.    \n\n\n\n  Influence of pH on the toxicity of carbaryl \n\n172 \n\n \n\n \n\nFig 2 - Predicted and observed mixture toxicity. a) mixture ratio for acid pH; b) mixture \nratio for alkaline pH.    , prediction according to concentration addition;   , \nprediction according to independent action. \n\n \n\n4. Discussion  \n\nExtreme pH values showed to significantly impact zebrafish embryos survival. \n\nGenerally our data are in good agreement with previous studies on fish toxicity, where pH \n\nConcentrations \u00b5mol/L\n0.1 1 10 100 1000 10000\n\n%\n M\n\nor\nta\n\nlit\ny\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\na\n\nConcentrations (\u00b5mol/L)\n10 100 1000 10000\n\n%\n M\n\nor\nta\n\nlit\ny\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\nb\n\n\n\n  Influence of pH on the toxicity of carbaryl \n\n173 \n\n \n\nvalues below 5 and above 10 demonstrated to decrease fish survival (Dave, 1984; Jordahl \n\nand Benson, 1987; Kaur and Toor, 1980; Le Louarn and Webb, 1998). The detailed \n\ntoxicity profile of the entire pH range is subject of a separate chapter (chapter 3). The \n\ninsecticide carbaryl showed to be moderately toxic to zebrafish embryos. The toxicity of \n\ncarbaryl has been studied in several fish species including zebrafish where LCs varied \n\nfrom 5.3 to 44.66 mg/L (De Mel and Pathiratne, 2005; Lin et al., 2007; Mahboob et al., \n\n2014; Schock et al., 2012). As for pH, the detailed toxicity profile of carbaryl is also \n\nsubject of a separated publication (chapter 4).  \n\nThe joint effect of carbaryl and acid pH was correctly predicted by the CA model as \n\ndemonstrated in Fig. 2a. pH in the acidic range seems not to be a determinant factor on the \n\ntoxicity of carbaryl. This has been shown by other studies investigating the effects of pH \n\non the toxicity of carbaryl in invertebrates and amphibians. In the study of Lohner &amp; \n\nWarwick Fisher, (1990) acid pH had minimal effects on the toxicity of carbaryl to the \n\nmidge Chironomus riparius. Similarly, the study conducted by Relyea (2006) \n\ndemonstrated that a decrease in pH from 8 to 6 had no effect on survival of Rana \n\ncatesbeiana and Rana calmitans. Although these two stressors do not have the same mode \n\nof action, it seems that CA may quite precisely describe the combined effects of carbamate \n\ninsecticides and acidic pH, probably due to the stability of carbaryl under these conditions \n\n(see Table S2).  \n\nRegarding the alkaline pH range, both concepts clearly underestimated the toxicity \n\nof the combination at the ratio of LC50 as can be observed in Fig 2b. This strong deviation \n\nfrom the predicted toxicity is probably due to the higher toxicity of the main degradation \n\nproduct of carbaryl. The chemical analyses done (please refer to Table S2 in the \n\nsupplementary data) have demonstrated that carbaryl undergo rapid degradation under \n\nalkaline pH confirming the findings of Aly and El-Dib (1971) which showed that carbaryl \n\nis susceptible to hydrolysis at alkaline pH with a half-life of only 2.5 h at pH 9. As 1-\n\nnaphthol is the main degradation product a toxicity test was conducted with this compound \n\nto assess  if the observed deviation in the toxicity could be due to the higher toxicity of 1-\n\nnaphthol when compared to carbaryl. The Fig S3 (supplementary data) shows the \n\nconcentration-response curve for zebrafish embryos exposed to 1-naphthol (96 h-LC50 52 \n\n\u00b5mol/L) which proved to be 42% more toxic than carbaryl (96 h-LC50 74.3 \u00b5mol/L).  The \n\neffects of alkaline pH on carbaryl toxicity have also been explored in the past in different \n\n\n\n  Influence of pH on the toxicity of carbaryl \n\n174 \n\n \n\nexperimental designs without the use of any approach for the calculation of the expected \n\ncombinatory toxicity. Woodward &amp; Mauck, (1980) investigated the effects of insecticides \n\nto the Cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii) and found that an increase in pH from 6.5 to \n\n8.5 was responsible for an increase in the toxicity of carbaryl by a factor of 5 and also for \n\nother carbamate insecticide aminocarb by a factor of 20. In another study also conducted \n\nwith carbamate insecticide Mauck et al., (1977) demonstrated that at pH 9.5 mexacarbate \n\n(zectran) toxicity increased 38 times to the bluegills (Lepomis macrochirus). The authors \n\nattributed this high toxicity at alkaline pH to the breakdown product of zectran, 4-amino-\n\n3,5-xylenol that was 70 times more lethal to bluegills than mexacarbate. From our results \n\nand from the literature, it seems that the impact of alkaline pH on the toxicity of carbamate \n\ninsecticides is primarily due to hydrolysis of the compounds into more toxic products.  \n\nAs observed by our study, changes in environmental factors such as pH may \n\nenhance the acute toxicity of pesticides and underestimate their effects to aquatic biota. \n\nSome recent reviews have highlighted the importance of the possible interactive effects of \n\nenvironmental stressors and chemical pollution (Heugens et al., 2001; Holmstrup et al., \n\n2010; Laskowski et al., 2010; Noyes et al., 2009). Heugens et al., 2001 reviewed the \n\ncombined effects of stressful environmental conditions (temperature, nutritional state and \n\nsalinity) and various classes of chemicals including pesticides. They concluded that in \n\ngeneral the toxicity increased with increasing temperature and decreasing nutrient supply. \n\nIn other review conducted by Laskowski et al., 2010, natural environmental factors showed \n\nto significantly modify the effects of toxicants on the tested organisms and the authors \n\nargued the necessity of incorporating natural stressors in ecological risk assessment.  \n\nPesticides and environmental factors can \u201cinteract\u201d in a variety of ways; natural \n\nfactors can, for example, change the physicochemical properties of the pesticides \n\nmodifying the adsorption, desorption, volatilization and degradation rates and directly \n\ninfluencing their bioavailability (Heugens et al 2001). Toxicokinetics may also be \n\ninfluenced by environmental factors through alterations in the uptake or detoxification \n\nrates (L\u00f8kke et al., 2013). Furthermore, the combined effects of natural stressors and \n\ntoxicants can also affect the physiological state of organisms especially when the natural \n\nstressor reaches extreme levels such as extreme acidic and alkaline pH (see compilation of \n\nexamples in Heugens et al 2001, Holmstrup et al 2010 and Laskowski et al 2010). This is \n\nparticularly important when applying mixture concepts such as CA and IA for the \n\n\n\n  Influence of pH on the toxicity of carbaryl \n\n175 \n\n \n\nprediction of combined effects of environmental factors and chemicals. Neither CA nor IA \n\nrelates to biochemical and physiological process of exposed organisms, or consider \n\nphysicochemical characteristics of chemicals pollutants (Backhaus and Faust, 2012). \n\nHowever, these concepts have been successfully applied to investigate the combined \n\neffects of natural stressors and chemical pollutants (Jonker et al., 2005).  \n\nCA seemed to be the best model to predict the combined effects of pH and carbaryl. \n\nThis model has proven to provide good to excellent predictions of mixture toxicities \n\nregardless the similarity or dissimilarity of the modes of action of the mixture components. \n\nBelden et al., (2007) reviewing the effects of mixture of pesticides concluded that for 88% \n\nof the cases CA model had observed effective independent of the  mode of action of the \n\nmixture components. On the other hand, for mixtures with different modes of action, they \n\nobserved that IA was more accurate than CA; however, in most cases the differences \n\nbetween the two models were relatively small. Irrespective of the mode of action, CA has \n\nempirically shown to provide a more conservative combined effect estimations (Faust et \n\nal., 2003) and has been proposed as the general solution for mixture toxicity analysis even \n\nthough the mechanisms of action are unknown (Backhaus and Faust, 2012; Backhaus et al., \n\n2000; Berenbaum, 1985). \n\nNonetheless, when using either CA or IA for prediction of the combined toxicity of \n\nenvironmental factors and chemical stress this may not always be the case. In this type of \n\ncombination these concepts must be used with caution and knowledge of physicochemical \n\nproperties of a given chemical seems to be crucial for an accurate prediction of effects (at \n\nleast for abiotic factors known to modify physicochemical properties of chemicals). For the \n\nrisk assessment of binary and multiple mixtures of chemicals (with specific and unspecific \n\nmodes of action) many scientific concepts have been developed and validated for use \n\n(Altenburger and Greco, 2009; Backhaus and Faust, 2012). However, when dealing with \n\ncombination of chemical and nonchemical stress only few approaches are available but are \n\nnot ready yet for extrapolation for risk assessment practice as pointed out by Altenburger \n\nand Greco (2009). There is an urgent need to improve our understanding of the effects of \n\nenvironmental factors and chemical pollutants as the rapid climate change process is \n\nalready altering structure and function of natural ecosystems and also impacting the fate \n\nand behaviour of chemical pollutants.  \n\n\n\n  Influence of pH on the toxicity of carbaryl \n\n176 \n\n \n\nIn this regard, the joint-effects of pH and carbaryl observed in this study raise the \n\nconcern towards the risk assessment of pesticides. The potential toxicity of carbaryl is \n\nlikely to be underestimated by established procedures where pH is held constant. Although \n\nin the climate change context such extreme scenario (alkaline pH) may be exception rather \n\nthan the rule, our study - focusing in the lethal effects only \u2013 provide a first approach for \n\neffects screening. The use of sublethal endpoints would further give a more comprehensive \n\nunderstanding of the combined effects eventually detecting effects at pH levels more \n\nrealistic in terms of ecological relevance.  \n\n \n\n5. Conclusion \n\nWe have shown that environmental factors such as pH can modify the toxicity of \n\nthe pesticide carbaryl. The conceptual model CA allowed a precise prediction of the \n\ntoxicity of the joint-effects of acid pH and carbaryl. Nevertheless, for alkaline condition \n\nboth concepts failed in predicting the effects. Deviations to the model were however easy \n\nto explain as high pH values favour the hydrolysis of carbaryl with the consequent \n\nformation of the more toxic degradation product 1- naphthol. Although in the present study \n\nsuch explanatory process was easy to establish, for many other combinations the \n\n\u201cinteractive\u201d nature is not so evident. In the context of the climate change few scenarios \n\npredict such increase in the pH of aquatic systems, however this was a first approach \n\nfocused in the lethal effects only. In a second tier assessment effects at sublethal level \n\nwould be sought and it is expectable that more subtle pH changes (more realistic in terms \n\nof climate changes scenarios) may also have an effect at physiological and biochemical \n\nlevels with possible long term consequences for the population fitness. \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThis study was funded by FEDER through COMPETE and Programa Operacional \n\nFactores de Competitividade and by National funding through FCT- Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a \n\nCi\u00eancia e Tecnologia, within Climatox FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-027795 (Ref. \n\n\n\n  Influence of pH on the toxicity of carbaryl \n\n177 \n\n \n\nPTDC/AAG-GLO/4059/2012), a Post-Doc grant to I.

General Discussion \n \n\nThis thesis addressed the problem of environmental stress and its role on the \n\ntoxicity of pesticides, more particularly under a scenario of global changes in which \n\naquatic systems have to cope with multiple sources of stress simultaneously.  \n\nIn the last decades, the progressive changes on climate have had widespread \n\nimpacts on natural systems changing not only the structure and function of many \n\necosystems (Ben\u00edtez-Gilabert et al., 2010; Fenoglio et al., 2010; Mooij et al., 2005), but \n\nalso impacting distribution and toxicity of chemical pollutants such as pesticides \n\n(Bloomfield et al., 2006). The assessment and prediction of effects elicited by many \n\nstressors (natural and chemical) acting simultaneously in a ecosystem implies a deep \n\nknowledge on the toxicity of the individual components. Thus, in this thesis, the zebrafish \n\nacute embryo toxicity test was firstly used to evaluate the effects of selected environmental \n\nparameters (pH, Dissolved Oxygen (DO) and UV radiation) and pesticides (carbaryl and \n\ncarbendazim), providing a detailed and comprehensive analysis encompassing \n\nconcentration-response curves and respective half-maximal effect concentrations (LC50, \n\nEC50) that can be  further used in the assessment of combined stress. Zebrafish embryos, \n\nthe experimental model selected for this work, showed to be adequate to achieve the \n\nproposed objectives and showed to have advantageous features for the use in \n\necotoxicology. Particularly relevant is the high sensitivity of the locomotor assay deployed \n\nwith the high throughput system Zebrabox. The analysis of the individual stress \n\ncomponents at sublethal level provided information of effects at different levels of \n\nbiological organization potentially contributing to the establishment of adverse outcome \n\npathways of the compounds within the organism.  \n\nEnvironmental components studied were selected based on the relevance in the \n\ncontext of the climate changes that have been verified. pH is one of the most determinant \n\nparameters for any chemical and biochemical effects and is pointed out as one of the most \n\nimportant factors conditioning survival and fitness of many freshwater species.  \n\nAs for dissolved oxygen, although hypoxia episodes may occur in the aquatic \n\nenvironments, their frequency have been increasing by anthropogenic activities related to \n\norganic and nutrient enrichment in a phenomenon known as eutrophication. Due to rapid \n\n\n\nDiscussion: combined effects of environmental factors and pesticides \n\n191 \n \n\nhuman growth and global warming, the problem of hypoxia is likely to worsen in the \n\nupcoming years. An increasing temperature will lead to a considerable reduction in oxygen \n\nsolubility especially in freshwater systems.  \n\nIn aquatic systems, organisms may have to face the effects of another important \n\nenvironmental parameter: UV radiation. Projections show that the baseline levels of UV \n\nradiation will not be restored in the next decades (Weatherhead and Andersen, 2006). In \n\naddition, alterations in dissolved organic matter could affect UV transparency increasing \n\nthe exposure of aquatic species to UV radiation specially vertebrates such as amphibians \n\nand fish that deposit their eggs in shallow surface waters.  \n\nThe effect of each environmental stressor was evaluated on the survival and \n\ndevelopment of zebrafish embryos. Changes in environmental conditions showed to \n\ngreatly impact the performance of embryos by decreasing survival and inducing a series of \n\neffects such as hatching and developmental delay, decreased heart beat rate, increase \n\nincidence of deformities, reduced body length among others. This is the first \n\ncomprehensive and detailed analysis on the effects of environmental parameters including \n\na time-course analysis for both lethal and sublethal endpoints. These data give an important \n\ncontribution in the field of mixture toxicity providing baseline information to study the \n\ninteraction of environmental stress factors and toxic contaminants in the zebrafish embryo \n\nmodel. \n\nThe evaluation of the toxicity of two widely used pesticides (carbaryl and \n\ncarbendazim) using a multiple endpoint approach allowed the assessment of effects at \n\nseveral levels of biological organization including developmental, biochemical and \n\nbehavioural. Behaviour and biomarkers were the most sensitive endpoints, been capable of \n\ndetecting effects in very low concentration of pesticides, contributing to a mechanistic \n\nunderstanding of the effects.  \n\nEnvironmental parameters can interact with chemical pollutants in a variety of \n\nways. They can influence the degradation and/or bioavailability of chemical compounds \n\nand change the toxicokinetics. Temperature effects on uptake and detoxification rates are a \n\nclassical example as reviewed by Heugens et al (2001). Furthermore, environmental \n\nfactors can also compromise the physiological state of organisms, potentially impairing \n\nfitness and the capacity to cope with additional stress. Spurgeon et al., (2010) proposed a \n\nframework to investigate mixture effects that can also be applied to the study of multiple \n\n\n\nDiscussion: combined effects of environmental factors and pesticides \n\n192 \n \n\nstressors toxicity (chemical and nonchemical stress). The framework takes into account the \n\nthree above mentioned process: the bioavailability, toxicokinetics and the sensitivity of the \n\norganism (toxicodynamics) (Fig 1).  \n\n \n\nUnderstanding how the environmental factors may act in each of the above \n\nmentioned processes is essential to interpret the underlying mechanisms of the toxicity of \n\nmixtures when the combined effects deviate from either concentration addition (CA) or \n\nindependent action (IA) (Spurgeon 2010).  \n\nIn this thesis we evaluated the combined effects of acidic and alkaline pH on the \n\ntoxicity of the carbamate insecticide carbaryl by applying the well-known predictive \n\nmodels CA and IA. The results showed that concentration addition allows a precise \n\nprediction of the toxicity of the combination of acid pH and carbaryl. Nevertheless, for \n\nalkaline condition both concepts underestimated the effects, although the inaccuracy of the \n\nCA model was smaller than that of the IA model. In the case of alkaline level, high pH \n\nvalues played a crucial role by modifying the toxicity of carbaryl through hydrolysis and \n\nconsequently increasing its toxicity to zebrafish embryos and may be the main cause of \n\nFigure  1: Framework to investigate multiple stressors effects. Adapted from Spurgeon et al 2010. \n\n\n\nDiscussion: combined effects of environmental factors and pesticides \n\n193 \n \n\ndeviation from CA and IA. Neither CA nor IA considers specific chemical characteristics \n\nof the components of the mixture as well as physiological process of the exposed \n\norganisms. This can be a drawback of these two models to evaluate combined effects of \n\nchemical and nonchemical stressors, but at the same time, the simplicity of these two \n\nconcepts may allow the establishment of guidelines and frameworks for mixture toxicity \n\nassessment in general (e.g. Backhaus &amp; Faust 2012).  \n\nMostly importantly, the results of this thesis demonstrated that pH can significantly \n\naffect the toxicity of pesticides to zebrafish embryos. The findings show that natural \n\nstressors and/or multiple stressors toxicities should not be neglected in the risk assessment \n\nof chemicals in order to avoid underestimation of risk and, therefore adequately protect \n\naquatic ecosystems. Results presented here consist of a first tier assessment focusing at the \n\nlethal level only and although may not reflect a realistic environmental exposure scenario \n\n(except in extreme cases) highlight the importance of considering environmental variables \n\nas co-stressors in aquatic environments. Future approaches comprising also sublethal \n\neffects and therefore including realistic exposure scenarios may give a more sound \n\nperspective of risk in the context of climate changes. \n\n Although the study of combinations of chemical and nonchemical stressors have \n\nprogressed in the last few years, further research has to be conducted to evaluate and/or \n\ndevelop new approaches to describe this type of combination in order to detect deviations \n\non the expected toxicity. Future work should focus on the evaluation of the potential \n\nimpact of other important environmental stressors in the toxicity of chemical pollutants as \n\ndissolved oxygen, where a lack of studies has been identified (chapter 2). Moreover, the \n\neffects of combinations of more than two stressors should also be considered reflecting a \n\nmore realistic scenario as in the environment. In addition, given that the assessment of \n\nevery single pesticide under all exposure scenarios is unfeasible, the challenge for the \n\nfuture will be the identification and therefore prioritization of most relevant exposure \n\nconditions to be assessed. \n\n \n\n\n\nDiscussion: combined effects of environmental factors and pesticides \n\n194 \n \n\nReferences \n\nBackhaus, T., Faust, M., 2012.
