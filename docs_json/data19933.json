Introduction  \n\nThe paper studies the relationship between energy and carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) and \n\nhighlights the financial depth effect on oil producing countries. The role of CO2 is analysed as \n\neconomic growth driver and as explained variable. To scrutinize the nexus, a panel data entry with \n\nthirteen countries and a time period between 1970 and 2012 was used. The inclusion of inflation \n\nfulfil a gap on this nexus. Indeed, this indicator can be used as a proxy of economic instability for \n\nthe oil producing countries. \n\nThe oil production and consumption has an active role on the literature. In fact, more than \n\nunderstanding their impact on economic growth, we need to realize other effects in the energy\u2013\n\ngrowth nexus. This nexus raises concerns related with the environment, namely pollution and CO2. \n\nThe relationship between CO2 and energy consumption is positive (Saidi and Hammami, 2015). In \n\nspecial, the role of financial development should be better comprehended to supplant the current \n\nlack of consensus (e.g. Goldsmith, 1969; Minier, 2009; Sadorsky, 2010; Kaminsky and Reinhart, 1999; \n\nDeidda and Fattouh, 2002; Wachtel, 2003). This lack of consensus could be explained by the focus \n\nof research tends to be directed for the oil exporter countries (Fuinhas et al., 2015). \n\nThe main objective of this paper is to understand the relationship between energy and CO2, \n\nhighlighting the financial depth effect. To capture these effects, variables such as CO2, Gross \n\nDomestic Product, Oil Consumption, Exports, Oil Rents, Production, International Crude Oil Prices, \n\nInflation, and Financial Depth were used. The fact of analysing a long- time period allows dynamic \n\nrelationships between variables and therefore, the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model \n\ncomes out as the most suitable. An empirically supported multivariate panel was elaborated with \n\nthe following specifications: (i) Group of oil producing countries with available data; (ii) A review of \n\nthe ratio between oil production and primary energy consumption; and (iii) verify the impacts of the \n\nsecond oil shock. Following the procedure, the econometric techniques allows: (a) the evaluation of \n\nlong- and short-run effects (b) to overpass the issue of the order of integration of variables. The \n\nused estimator allows to work with variables integrated I(0) and I(1); and (c) the usage of long- time \n\nspan allow evaluate the co-integration or the long- memory (fractional co-integration) relationships \n\namong variables. \n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 review of the literature. Section 3 \n\ndescribes data and methodology. Section 4 is centred on the results. In section 5, the results are \n\ndiscussed. Section 6 concludes.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\n2. Literature Review \n\nThe analysis of the relationship between energy and CO2 highlighting the effect of the Financial \n\nDepth and Inflation is largely a new approach given that the topic is rarely addressed. By the \n\nreverse, growth-energy nexus is well known study area. A literature survey on energy-growth nexus \n\ncan be seen in Omri (2014) and Menegaki (2013). \n\nThe causal relationship between energy and growth suggests the incorporation of \n\nenvironmental issues and CO2. A literature survey on CO2-energy-growth nexus can be seen in Omri \n\n(2013). Furthermore, financial development associated with the growth-energy nexus is also \n\nfeatured at the literature. Financial depth can enhance economic growth and affect the demand for \n\nenergy (Sadorsky, 2010). The empirical results reveal a positive and significant relationship between \n\nfinancial development and energy. This phenomenon occur when financial development is measured \n\nby the deposit money bank assets to GDP, financial system deposits to GDP, or liquid liabilities to \n\nGDP (Sadorsky, 2011). Following Karanfil (2009), Dan and Lijun (2009) examined the effect of \n\nfinancial development on primary energy use in Guangdong, China. They found unidirectional \n\ncausality from energy use to financial development. The concern with the environment is reported \n\nin some studies, namely in the causality field. A literature survey on energy consumption, financial \n\ndevelopment, and economic growth and CO2 emission can be seen in Ziaei (2015). \n\nDue to the complex relationship of causalities and despite of the huge amount of studies in \n\nthis area, the consensus among authors was far from reached. In an empirical overview, there are \n\nfive possible occurrences: (1) Growth hypothesis \u2013 energy as a positive effect on growth; (2) Neutral \n\nhypothesis \u2013 absence of causality; (3) Conservation hypothesis \u2013 unidirectional causality from growth \n\nto energy; (4) Feedback hypothesis \u2013 bidirectional causality between growth and energy; (5) \n\nResource curse hypothesis \u2013 \u201cnegative\u201d energy produces growth. \n\nThe resource curse hypothesis is suggested in the literature to analyse the causality \n\nrelationships between energy and growth. This phenomenon may be described as an economic \n\nconstraint to oil producer\u2019s countries. Indeed, these countries expect to receive economic and \n\nsocial benefits from the wealth, generated by encouraging the local and national economy or \n\nindirectly by increasing tax revenues, as result of government involvement (Costa e Santos, 2013). \n\nIn the analysis of CO2 embodying the nexus growth-energy and oil producing countries \n\ndevelopment, there are two decisions that must be done: (1) what is the most relevant energy \n\nvariable to explain CO2?; and (2) with oil production, what is the most suitable ratio to explain the \n\nrelationship between energy-growth-development and CO2? To answer to the first question, \n\nfollowing seminal literature the oil consumption is the one that produce most appropriate results. \n\nMoreover, primary energy consumption and the decomposition of oil primary energy consumption in \n\nother power sources can also be used. Decomposing a variable allows a better comprehension of the \n\nmain role of oil consumption in primary energy context (Fuinhas et al., 2015). The same authors \n\nhighlight the importance of integrating oil consumption and productions variables as well as oil \n\nprices and international oil prices. It is expected that oil producer countries reveal some \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nidiosyncrasies, i.e. the existence of price volatility due to special circumstances, derived of the high \n\ncorrelation between fossil fuels and CO2. \n\nThe nexus complexity may be harmed by the endogenous resources availability. That \n\navailability can be controlled through the computation. A literature gap can be verified with the \n\nlack of inflation on the group of financial variables. Furthermore, inflation may exert a positive or a \n\nnegative impact on growth. The positive effect can occur due to the excess of demand and inciting \n\na tireless rise of prices, and the negative effect stems of measuring economic instability, suggesting \n\na possible economic volatility. With the oil producer countries, a negative coefficient is expected. \n\nIn fact, the inflation and the relationship between energy and CO2 is not in focus at the literature \n\nand therefore there is a limited understanding of this variable. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\n3. Data and methodology  \n\nFor the analysis of the relationship between economic growth and CO2, was used a panel \n\nwith annual frequency data from 1970 to 2012, for a group of oil producing countries, namely Saudi \n\nArabia, Algeria, Australia, Denmark, Egypt, Ecuador, United States of America, India, Italy, \n\nMalaysia, Mexico, Peru and Trinidad and Tobago .These countries were chosen due to letting a \n\ncontinuous sample for the longest time span possible. The source of the raw annual data was the \n\nWorld Bank Data, for gross domestic product (GDP), exports of goods and services, oil rents, \n\npopulation, domestic credit provided by banking sector, domestic credit provided by private sector, \n\nand consumer price index; and the BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2014, for carbon \n\ndioxide emissions, oil consumption, oil production, primary energy consumption, and crude oil \n\nprices. The raw data variables used are: (i) GDP (constant local currency unit); (ii) exports of goods \n\nand services (% of GDP); (iii) oil rents (% of GDP); (iv) population (total of persons); (v) carbon \n\ndioxide emissions (million tonnes); (vi) oil consumption (million tonnes); (vii) oil production (million \n\ntonnes); (viii) primary energy consumption (million tonnes oil equivalent); (ix) crude oil prices (US \n\ndollars per barrel, 2013); (x) inflation (measured by first differences of logs of consumer price \n\nindex); (xi) financial depth (% of GDP). The option of using a constant local currency unit allowed \n\nthe influence of exchange rates to be circumvented. The econometric analysis was performed using \n\nStata 13.1 and EViews 9 software. \n\nThe raw variables were transformed in: (a) CO2 emissions per capita (CO2PC); (b) Gross \n\nDomestic Product per capita (YPC); (c) Exports of goods and services per capita (XPC); (d) Oil rents \n\nper capita (ORPC); (e) Oil consumption per capita (OCPC); (f) Ratio between oil production and \n\nenergy consumption (SE) - this ratio is used to control the heterogeneity and the oil production \n\n(Fuinhas et al., 2015), and can measure the importance of oil production in terms of primary \n\nenergy; (g) Ratio between oil production and consumption (SO) \u2013 this ratio registers the progress \n\nmade during a time period of the relative weight of oil production to oil consumption, and is used to \n\ncontrol the heterogeneity of oil producers; (h) Oil prices (P) \u2013 defined as the international oil price, \n\nthis variable is equal to all countries. (i) Inflation (INFL) \u2013 computed as the first differences of the \n\nnatural logarithms of the consumer price index; (j) Financial Depth (PF) \u2013 computed as the \n\naggregation of the Domestic Credit Provided by Banking Sector (DCPS) and the Domestic Credit \n\nProvided by Private Sector divided by the GDP. \n\nThe study follows two different approaches: (i) the first one evaluates the impact of CO2 as \n\na source of economic growth with inflation as background; (ii) the second, using the same data, \n\ntries to capture the economic growth effect on CO2. Both approaches can be found at the \n\nliterature. It is common to use Gross Domestic Product, measures of energy consumption, energy \n\nprices and traditional production factors. Occasionally, variables like exportations, CO2 per capita \n\nor urbanizations (e.g. Mohammadi and Parvaresh, 2014) or oil prices and production in scale \n\n(Fuinhas et al., 2015) or even financial development are used (Nili and Rastad, 2007). The inflation \n\nis rarely used in these approaches. This variable can have either coefficient signals, positive (as a \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nresult of excess of demand causing a rise of production and prices) or negative (as a result of \n\nmeasuring economic instability). \n\nThe dynamical effects are expected due to the long span of time. Different behaviours in \n\nthe long- and short-run are also expected. The computation of the variables was made through the \n\nUECM from the ARDL, introduced by Pesaran and Shin (1999). The ARDL estimator possesses all the \n\nnecessary properties to generate consistent and efficient parameters. Moreover, the estimator can \n\ndeal with variables with integration order I(0) and I(1) and work as a support to the standard errors. \n\nThe variables used are expressed in Logarithms (L) and first differences (D). The first coefficients \n\nmatch to the elasticities and the seconds to the semi-elasticities. \n\nThe relationship between energy and CO2 will be tested with two different processes to \n\ncapture the financial depth effect. First the growth model (YPC) evaluate the CO2 effect over the \n\neconomic growth. Second, the CO2 model (CO2PC) assess the drivers of CO2. Severe attention must \n\nbe paid to the individual coefficient interpretation. Indeed, with multivariate models all the \n\nindependent variables are relevant and contribute to describe the dependent variable. The \n\nexplanations provided should have in count the dynamical effects. \n\nThe used countries share some common characteristics like oil production. Like that, Cross \n\nSection Dependence (CSD) is expected. This phenomenon implies interdependence between the \n\ncrosses due to the common shocks (Eberhardt, 2011). If countries react in the same way to shocks \n\nthe existence of correlations is verified. This fact suggests the existence of common non-observable \n\nevents. Taking this in account, Table 1 with the descriptive statistics, coefficients of variation and \n\nindividual CSD test is presented. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\n \nTable 1 \n\nDescriptive statistics and CSD \n\nVariables \nDescriptive statistics CSD \n\nObs Mean Std.

The Stata command xtcd was \nused to compute CSD tests. \n\n \n\n \n\nThrough the Table 1 the highly dependence of the variables can be checked. With \n\nsignificance values of 1%, this shows that an introduced shock may affects in the same way all the \n\ncountries. The CO2 was increased less than the economic growth. Moreover, CSD is not present in \n\nthe variables LOCPC, SE and SO. This fact suggests that the countries react in different ways to the \n\noil consumption and to de ratios oil production to oil consumption or primary energy consumption. \n\nThe unit root tests of first and second generation were applied to verify the integration \n\norder of the variables, i.e. I(0) and I(1). The first generation tests used were Levin Lin e Chu (2002) \n\n(LLC), ADF-Fisher (Maddala e Wu, 1999), ADF-Choi (Choi, 2001), while the second generation test \n\nwas CIPS (Pesaran, 2007). This test has the advantage of being robust for heterogeneity and relax \n\nthe cross-sectional independence assumption. After computing the tests, it was confirmed that the \n\nvariables are integrated I(0) and I(1). The absence of I(2) variables allows consistent estimations for \n\nthe dynamical estimators. The results can be checked at Annex A. \n\nAnother issue referred at the literature is the collinearity, i.e. the correlation between \n\nvariables.

This test \n\nfaces fixed effects (FE) with (RE). According to the Hausman test, the null hypothesis represents RE \n\nmodel while the alternative hypothesis indicates FE model. The FE model reveals evidence of \n\nindividual correlation between countries and removes all the invariant characteristics. The Hausman \n\ntest selected the FE as the most suitable estimator. Indeed this result establish the necessity of \n\ncomputing another tests, namely to apprise the heterogeneity. For a dynamic approach, the \n\nheterogeneity may assume two shapes: (i) short- and long-run; and (ii) short-run. To deal with this, \n\nthe estimators Mean Group (MG) and (PMG) could be applied. These estimators require a large \n\nnumber of observations (N) and time (T) (Blackburne III and Frank, 2007). The MG model is the most \n\nflexible, by enabling the heterogeneity of the coefficients between countries. This model is \n\neffective when long- and short-run estimations are made, but ineffective against homogeneity \n\n(Pesaran et al., 1999). This model needs a long span of time and a large number of countries, 20 to \n\n30 countries (Ciarlone, 2011). The PMG allows the existence of heterogeneity in the coefficients of \n\nshort-run and homogeneity in the coefficients of long-run. If the presence of homogeneity in the \n\ncoefficients of long-run is confirmed, the PMG model will be chosen as the most suitable. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\n4. Results \n\nThe exhaustive control of the integration order of the variables is being conclusive as was \n\nshown at Annex A. As explained before, the econometric techniques must be suitable to deal with \n\nvariables integrated as I(0) and I(1). To assess the presence of heterogeneity, the MG and PMG were \n\ncarefully exanimated and tested against the dynamic FE estimator. \n\nThe MG, PMG and FE model estimations as the results of the Hausman test are provided at \n\nTable 4.

From Table 4 we can \n\nobserve that the FE estimator is the most suitable, i.e. there is homogeneity for both models in the \n\npanel data entry. These results sustain that oil producing countries share same coefficients and can \n\nbe treated in the same way. \n\nTo reinforce the FE parameter significance, several tests were made to identify the \n\nexistence of econometric violations, namely heteroskedasticity, correlations, autocorrelations and \n\nCSD. The Wald test was used to control the heteroskedasticity of the residuals. Next he Pesaran test \n\nanalyses the presence of contemporaneous relationships between crosses. The null hypothesis \n\nspecifies that the residuals are not correlated and follow a normal distribution. The Breusch-Pagan \n\nLagrangian Multiplier was applied to test the cross sectional Independence and verify the \n\ncorrelation between errors. At last, the Wooldridge test assesses the presence of autocorrelation of \n\nfirst order. The results are revealed at Table 5. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nTable 5 \n\nSpecification tests \n\nTests \n  Growth model   CO2 model \n\n  Statistics \n\nModified Wald   chi2(13)= 383.27***   chi2(13)= 1808.14*** \n\nPesarant   -1577    0.569 \n\nBreusch-Pagan LM   n. a.   n. a. \n\nWooldrige   F(1,12) = 105.952***   F(1,12) = 40.842*** \n\nNote: *** denotes significant at 1% level; results for H0 of Hausman test (with the option sigmamore) : difference in \ncoefficients not systematic; results for H0 of Modified Wald test: sigma(i)^2 = sigma^2 for all I; results for H0 of Pesaran and: \nresiduals are not correlated; results for H0 of Wooldrige test: no first-order autocorrelation; n. a. denote not available. \n\n \n\nThe applied tests come out as appropriate and revealed the existence of heteroskedasticity, \n\nautocorrelation of first order and contemporaneous correlation. With these phenomena the \n\nelasticities and semi-elasticities, shocks and speed adjustments for both models are presented at \n\nthe Table 6. The models were re-estimated and the significance of the variables was maintained. \n\nFurthermore, the elasticities of long-run have a different way of reading them. By the reverse, the \n\nshort-run elasticities have a direct reading for having equal coefficients. To measure the long-run \n\nelasticities the ratio between the coefficient of each independent variable and the coefficient of \n\nthe dependent variable (LYPC) for growth model and (LCO2PC) for CO2 model was made. Moreover, \n\nthe variables had lag 1 and were multiplied by (-1).

Discussion \n\nThe main objective of this study is highlighting the relationship between energy and CO2 \n\namong with financial development for a group of oil producer countries. Furthermore, 2 different \n\nviews can be found through CO2: (1) First as a growth engine; and (2) as a dependent variable \n\nexplained by his own drivers.  \n\nPreliminary tests revealed the presence of heteroskedasticity, CSD, residual correlation, \n\nfirst order autocorrelation and I(0) and I(1) of integration order. Moreover, the panel data entry \n\nused covers: (i) developed and developing countries; (ii) small and big oil producer countries; and \n\n(iii) to ensure a robust analysis, a large span of time was used. The dynamical panel data techniques \n\nare adequate to the study. Indeed, short- and long-run effects are detected, sustaining the former \n\nstatement. The adjustment speeds are negative and statistically significant. The ECM term for the \n\ngrowth model is low (slightly over 8%, see table 8) while for the CO2 model is very low (under 3%). \n\nThis fact suggests that a long span of time is needed when a shock is introduced. Likewise, the \n\neconomic structure from the oil producer countries is weak and takes too much time to overpass \n\npossible shocks due to the lack of competitiveness. \n\nThe growth model reveals a high number of positive coefficients in the short- and long-run. \n\nUndeniably, some variables only present a short-run effect on growth, namely CO2 (CO2PC), oil \n\nconsumption (OCPC) and International oil prices (P). In the main terms, the variables that have a \n\nhigher impact on growth are the goods and services exportations (EXPC) at long-run and oil \n\nconsumption (OCPC) at short-run. Additionally, a negative coefficient is verified at the oil rents \n\n(ORPC) and financial depth (PF) both on short- and long-run. The inflation has a negative coefficient \n\ntoo but only at long-run. Forward, a more detailed discussion will be provided. \n\nAt the CO2 model, variables like oil consumption (OCPC), oil rents (ORPC) and financial \n\ndepth (PF) only enhances growth at the short-run. In this model, GDP (YPC) is the main propeller at \n\nshort- and long-run. The relationship between oil production to consumption (SO) or primary energy \n\nconsumption (SE) reveal explanation power at short- and long-run for both models. As result of this \n\nrelationship, for growth have a positive impact while to CO2 as negative effect. This dissimilitude is \n\nexpected. On the one hand, when oil production increases relatively to oil consumption this impacts \n\npositively on growth. On the other hand, the negative effect of the ratio of oil production to \n\nprimary energy consumption indicates the phenomenon of concentration of wealth typical of \n\neconomies that are resource abundant. Indeed, wealth concentration contributes to lower CO2 per \n\ncapita due to the specialization effect (Fuinhas et al., 2015). \n\nComparing both models expose interesting results. Indeed, oil prices (P) are highly \n\nsignificant at short- and long-run on both models. Furthermore, different signals are presented for \n\nthe growth and CO2 models. A positive coefficient is revealed for the growth model and a negative \n\none for the CO2 model. This phenomenon is consistent with the founded effect on oil rents (ORPC) \n\nand for financial depth (PF) with a negative effect on growth model and a positive effect on CO2 \n\nmodel. Therefore, when the oil extraction costs decrease, the local economic will all suffer the \n\neffect. The financial depth coefficient presents a negative impact on growth model and positive \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\nimpact on CO2 model. In fact, this phenomenon may occur due to the recent financial crisis, a weak \n\nbanking sector, and low level of finance trough the banking sector. In a different perspective, a \n\npositive impact could be in the agenda if the financial sector presents a low level of development, \n\nlike the high growth rate of credit market in economies in development, originating a GDP increase. \n\nAt last, inflation revealed a negative coefficient in the long-run at the growth model due to her \n\nfunctions, i.e. capture the economic instability. This result was expectant attending to the group of \n\ncountries selected. Therefore, the instability effect dominates the excess of demand. Hence, this \n\noutcome suggests the presence of an indirect weak growth hypothesis of the oil-growth nexus. \n\nIndeed, the analyses of the two models detect causality running from CO2 to growth, and causality \n\nrunning from oil consumption to CO2, in the short-run. The obtained results should be considered by \n\nthe policymakers in order to apply better energy policies. \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\n6. Conclusion \n\nThis paper analyses the relationship between energy and CO2, highlighting the role of \n\nfinancial depth and inflation. For this paper, annual frequency data from 1970 to 2012 for a group \n\nof thirteen oil producer countries was used. Additionally, CO2 are studied as a growth propellant \n\nand as explained variable. \n\nThe results contribute to the literature by providing a detailed explanation to the growth-\n\nCO2 nexus. Furthermore, the introduction of a new variable, namely inflation, revealed to be a \n\ngood innovation. The financial institutions in oil producer countries are weak and financial sector is \n\nundeveloped. Other factor can be provided from the excess of financial system development. In the \n\nliterature, excess of finance harms growth. \n\nThe consistence of the results suggest that the resources curse phenomenon should not be \n\nneglected and deserve be considered in the literature. In fact, most of the studies only use rents \n\nfrom exploration of endogenous resources. The results are consistent as the CO2 are an important \n\ngrowth driver and vice-versa. Moreover, the emissions cause economic growth on the short-run. A \n\nbi-directional relationship between CO2 and growth was shown. The ratio between oil production \n\nand primary energy consumption reduce CO2 at short- and long-run. At the growth model this ratio \n\nis a driver to growth. The oil consumption contributes for both growth and short-run CO2. Similar \n\nresults are obtained with financial depth and oil rents. The inflations imply a decrease on growth at \n\nlong-run while oil prices reduces CO2 in the short-run and enhance growth at short-run to. Both \n\nexportations and ratio between oil production and consumption increase the growth rate at short- \n\nand long-run. This phenomenon emphasizes that an increase in exports and surpluses promotes \n\neconomic growth. Oil rents decrease the growth rate at short- and long-run, i.e. the resources curse \n\ncould be considered as a blessing to these countries. \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\nReferences \n\nBlackburne III, E.
