This long-term experiment (22 years) was evaluated during\n\n30 days in autumn, to quantify the effect of tillage systems (conventional tillage-\n\nCT and no-till-NT) on the soil CO2-C flux in a Rhodic Hapludox in Rio Grande do Sul\n\nState, Southern Brazil.  A closed-dynamic system (Flux Chamber 6400-09, Licor)\n\nand a static system (alkali absorption) were used to measure soil CO2-C flux\n\nimmediately after soybean harvest.  Soil temperature and soil moisture were\n\nmeasured simultaneously with CO2-C flux, by Licor-6400 soil temperature probe\n\nand manual TDR, respectively.  During the entire month, a CO2-C emission of less\n\nthan 30 % of the C input through soybean crop residues was estimated.  In the\n\nmean of a 30 day period, the CO2-C flux in NT soil was similar to CT, independent of\n\nthe chamber type used for measurements.  Differences in tillage systems with\n\ndynamic chamber were verified only in short term (daily evaluation), where NT\n\nhad higher CO2-C flux than CT at the beginning of the evaluation period and lower\n\nflux at the end.  The dynamic chamber was more efficient than the static chamber\n\nin capturing variations in CO2-C flux as a function of abiotic factors.  In this chamber,\n\nthe soil temperature and the water-filled pore space (WFPS), in the NT soil,\n\nexplained 83 and 62 % of CO2-C flux, respectively.

Este estudo foi desenvolvido em experimento de longa dura\u00e7\u00e3o\n\n(22 anos), durante o per\u00edodo de 30 dias do outono, com o objetivo de avaliar o impacto de\n\nsistemas de preparo de solo (preparo convencional-PC e plantio direto-PD) nas emiss\u00f5es de C-\n\nCO2 de um Latossolo Vermelho distr\u00f3fico, em Cruz Alta, RS.  As emiss\u00f5es de C-CO2 do solo\n\nforam avaliadas com c\u00e2maras din\u00e2mica (Flux Chamber 6400-09, Licor) e est\u00e1tica (com\n\ncapta\u00e7\u00e3o em solu\u00e7\u00e3o alcalina), imediatamente ap\u00f3s a colheita da soja.  A temperatura e a\n\numidade do solo foram registradas, concomitantemente com as emiss\u00f5es de C-CO2, por meio\n\nde sensor de temperatura e TDR manual, respectivamente, integrantes do Licor-6400.  Estimou-\n\nse que, em 30 dias, uma quantidade equivalente a menos de 30 % do C aportado pelos res\u00edduos\n\nde soja foi emitida na forma de C-CO2.  As emiss\u00f5es de C-CO2 no solo em PD foram similares\n\n\u00e0s emiss\u00f5es do solo em PC, independentemente do tipo de c\u00e2mara utilizada.

A c\u00e2mara din\u00e2mica foi mais\n\neficiente do que a est\u00e1tica em captar as altera\u00e7\u00f5es das emiss\u00f5es de C-CO2 em fun\u00e7\u00e3o da\n\nvaria\u00e7\u00e3o da temperatura e a porosidade preenchida por \u00e1gua (PPA) no solo em PD, as quais\n\nexplicaram 83 e 62 % das emiss\u00f5es de C-CO2, respectivamente.  O fator Q10, que avalia a\n\nsensibilidade da emiss\u00e3o de C-CO2 \u00e0 temperatura do solo, foi estimado em 3,93, indicando\n\nalta sensibilidade da atividade microbiana \u00e0 temperatura do solo durante o outono.

Carbon dioxide is the\nmain greenhouse gas, being estimated that agriculture\nsector could contribute up to 75 % of total Brazilian\nemission (Embrapa, 2006).  Soil CO2-C flux is\nincreased by the land use change and biomass\nburning, fossil fuel use, consumption of industrialized\nproducts that demands high energy to manufacture,\nand by tillage, that increases the biological activity\nand soil C oxidation (Reicosky &amp; Lindstrom, 1993).\n\nSoil is an important natural C pool and it is\nestimated that the amount of C stored in its first meter\nis 1350 \u00b1 250 Pg (1Pg = 109 Mg), therefore more than\ntwice the amount stored in the atmosphere (750 Pg)\n(Sundquist, 1993).  Soil management practices\ninfluence soil C flux to atmosphere and can define if\nthe soil will act as a source or a sink of atmospheric\nC.  In the conventional tillage (CT), plowing followed\nby harrowing, induces aggregate breakdown and\nincreases C turnover as a consequence of the exposure\nof organic matter to microbes activity and their\nenzymes (Six et al., 1998, 2006).  Soil aggregation\nhas been considered the main mechanism of C\nprotection of a wide range of soil classes (Six et al.,\n2000; Bayer et al., 2000a; Denef et al., 2004; Dieckow\n\n\n\nCARBON DIOXIDE EFFLUX IN A RHODIC HAPLUDOX AS AFFECTED BY TILLAGE SYSTEMS...           327\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 33:325-334, 2009\n\net al., 2005; Fabrizzi et al., 2008).  In addition, soil\ntillage results in a higher contact between soil and\nresidues and increases soil temperature, both\nprocesses that favor organic matter decay and increase\nof soil CO2-C flux (Reicosky &amp; Lindstrom, 1993; Bayer\net al., 2000a; La Scala et al., 2001; Lal, 2003).  On\nthe other hand, management systems associated to\nminimum soil disturbances, such as no-tillage (NT),\nwhen combined with high input of crop residues, favors\nsoil C storage (Mielniczuk, 1999; Amado et al., 2001;\nBayer et al., 2006).\n\nThe effect of tillage systems on soil CO2-C flux has\nbeen intensively investigated, but the results found\nabout its impact are divergent.  Usually, short-term\nCO2-C flux after tillage is higher in the CT plots\n(Reicosky &amp; Lindstrom, 1993; La Scala et al., 2006)\nor in some cases similar (Sanhueza et al., 1994; Fortin\net al., 1996; Campos, 2006; Costa et al., 2008) to the\nones registered in the NT plots.  On the other hand,\nsome researchers found higher emissions in NT than\nin CT systems (Hendrix et al., 1998; Ball et al., 1999),\nwhich indicates that the effect of soil tillage on soil\nCO2-C flux could be related to: duration, season, soil\nmoisture and temperature, soil type, the mechanism\nof soil C stabilization and C stock (Liu et al., 2006).\n\nThis study aimed to investigate the effect of tillage\nsystems on soil CO2-C flux in the fall season,\ndetermined by static and dynamic chambers, in a\nRhodic Hapludox in Cruz Alta, Rio Grande do Sul State,\nSouthern Brazil.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nClimate, soil and location\n\nThe study was carried out in a long term\nexperiment (22 years), in Cruz Alta, Rio Grande do\nSul State (Brazil), at FUNDACEP station (28 o 36 \u2019 S;\n53 o 40 \u2019 W; 409 m asl).  The soil was classified as clay\nRhodic Hapludox according to the soil taxonomy\n(USDA, 1999) and \u201cLatossolo Vermelho distr\u00f3fico\nt\u00edpico\u201d (LVd) by the Brazilian soil classification\n(Embrapa, 2005), and is cited in this paper as Oxisol.\nThe soil analysis at the beginning of the experiment\n(0\u20130.20 m layer) determined contents of: 570 g kg-1\n\nclay, 120 g kg-1 silt, 310 g kg-1 sand, 32 g kg-1 soil\norganic matter, pH (H2O) = 4.5, P = 19 mg dm\n\n-3, K =\n0.21 cmol c dm\n\n-3, Al 3+ = 0.12 cmol c dm\n-3 and\n\nCa2+ + Mg2+ = 0.42 cmolc dm\n-3 (Campos, 2006).  The\n\nFe content determined by ditionite-citrate-bicarbonete\nwas 63.5 g kg-1; hematite was predominant over\ngoethite (Inda Jr.  et al., 2004).\n\nThe climate was classified as humid subtropical,\nCfa 2a, according to K\u00f6ppen (Moreno, 1961).  Mean\nannual precipitation is 1755 mm (from 1974-2006),\nwith uniformly distributed rainfall during the year\nand mean air temperature of 18.7 \u00b0C (from 1998-2006),\nminimum temperature of 8.6 \u00b0C in July and\nmaximum of 30 \u00b0C in January, according to data of a\n\nmeteorological station (FUNDACEP) near the\nexperimental area.  The experiment evaluated two\ntillage systems (CT and NT) in the main plots (40 x\n60 m) and three crop rotation systems in split plots\n(40 x 20 m).  Measurements were performed in both\ntillage systems, but only in the following crop rotation\nsystem: black oat (Avena strigosa Schreber) /soybean\n(Glycine max (L.) Merr.)/ black oat + common vetch\n(Vicia sativa (L.) Walp.) /maize (Zea mays L.)/ radish\noil (Raphanus sativus L.  var.  oleiferus Metzg.)/ wheat\n(Triticum aestivum L.)/ soybean.  The CT treatment\nconsisted of tilling in a plow operation with four disk\nplow. The CT treatment consisted of soil tilling in a\nplow operation with four disk plow. The plow tillage\nwas done at a depth of 0.20 m followed by a harrow\ndisk operation with 36 disks at 0.15 m. Soil\ndisturbance in the NT treatment was minimal; the\nsoil was only mobilized along the rows, while the\ninterrow soil surface was maintained under a cover\nof crop residues.  In both tillage systems a planter\nwith double disk system was used (SEMEATO SHM\nmid land 15/17).\n\nCO2-C flux measurements\n\nSoil CO2-C flux was evaluated after soybean\nharvest by using static and dynamic chambers.\nSoybean was harvested on April 18, 2007, and soil\nCO2 flux measurements started on May 06, 2007\n(static chamber) and May 08, 2007 (dynamic chamber)\nand lasted for 30 days.\n\nIn the static chamber a CO2-capturing method was\napplied in an alkaline solution for 24 h in a closed\nchamber (Anderson, 1982), while the method in the\ndynamic chamber was based on direct measurements\nof CO2 concentration changes within a closed chamber\nby using infrared absorption spectroscopy (Soil CO2\nFlux Chamber 6400-09, Licor, NE, USA), during a\nfew minutes.\n\nThe static chamber consisted of a PVC cylinder\n(diameter 0.3 m, height 0.3 m) that was inserted into\nthe soil to a depth of 0.05 m.  The top of the chamber\nwas covered with rubber aiming to seal it completely,\nand a Zn cover over it fixed with four screws distributed\nsymmetrically on the circumference.  On the inside,\n0.05 m above the soil, an x-format table was built to\nsupport the plastic cup with alkaline 1 mol L-1 NaOH\nsolution to capture CO2-C emitted during the 24 h\nperiod (Campos, 2006).  Four chambers were installed\nin the soil three days before tillage, to determine\nbaseline values of emission.  In the CT plot, all\nchambers were removed during soil tillage and replaced\nimmediately after.  The soil was tilled with a disk\nplow on May 09, 2007, with a harrow on May 11,\n2007, and winter sowing occurred on May 29, 2007.\nThe CO2 flux was registered on May 6, 9, 11, 14, 24,\n29, and 30, 2007, totalizing 7 days of measurement\nwithin 30 days.\n\nThe dynamic chamber consisted of a closed system\ninserted over 0.10 m diameter PVC collars that were\ndisplayed in soil at 0.01 m depth two days before the\n\n\n\n328 Luis Fernando Chavez et al.\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 33:325-334, 2009\n\nbeginning of CO2-C evaluation (Healy et al., 1996).\nThe chamber had an internal volume of 991 cm3, with\nan exposed area to soil of 71.6 cm2, and was coupled\nto a portable infrared gas analyzer (IRGA), which\ndetermined the changes in CO2 concentration inside\nthe chamber by means of optical absorption\nspectroscopy.  In this system, air passes continuously\nfrom the chamber through the IRGA, and soil CO2 is\ninferred based on the gas exchange rate within the\nchamber (D\u2019Andr\u00e9a et al., 2006).  The exchange rate\nbased on CO2 concentration within the chamber was\ncalculated every 2.5 s, and the soil CO2 was computed\nfor approximately 90 s per measurement.  Ten PVC\ncollars were installed in each of the CT and NT plots.\nThe CO2 flux measurements started one day before disk\nplowing, and were carried out on 15 measurement\ndays (May 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 21, 24, 28, 29,\nand 30, and July 6, 2007).  On the measurement days,\nsoil CO2-C flux was determined at 9:00 and 15:00 h,\nand a daily mean was calculated.  During tillage and\nsowing, measurements were intensified, with 5 daily\nreplications after disk harrowing, 11 after harrowing\nand 4 after sowing, to calculate the mean daily flux on\nthose days.  The soil CO2 flux results from both chambers\nwere expressed in C equivalent fluxes (CO2-C).\n\nSoil temperature, soil moisture measurements\nand meteorological data\n\nSoil temperature and soil moisture were evaluated\nat 0.10 m depth simultaneously to the CO2-C flux\nmeasurements by a temperature sensor (thermistor)\nand a TDR (time domain reflectometer) Campbell\u00ae\n\nsystems (Hydrosense TM, Campbell Scientific,\nAustralia), respectively.  As soil density was also\nmeasured at all points it was possible to calculate the\nWFPS.  Data of air temperature and rainfall during\nthe studied period were obtained from the\nmeteorological station FUNDACEP 50 m away from\nthe study site.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe effects of soil management systems on CO2-C\nflux were investigated by descriptive data analysis.\nThe soil CO2-C flux relation with soil temperature\nand WFPS was analyzed by the correlation coefficients\nof exponential and linear relationships, respectively.\nSoil CO2-C fluxes from static and dynamic chambers\nwere compared by linear regression adjustments and\nstandard mean error was used to compare the data.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nMeteorological conditions during the studied\nperiod\n\nIn terms of meteorological conditions at the study\nsite in May and June 2007, temperatures were colder\nand rainfall higher than usually registered.  A total\nrainfall of 179 mm was recorded in May (Figure 1a),\n\ncorresponding to a 24 % higher volume than the mean\nmonthly rainfall (136 mm).  Five rainfall events were\nobserved in the 30 day period when soil CO2-C flux\nwas measured, where 63 % of the total rainfall volume\nof the period was recorded in only two events.  As\nexpected, higher WFPS values were found immediately\nafter the stronger rains (Figure 1a).  In general, the\nvalues of WFPS in the NT soil were higher than in\nthe CT plot, which is in agreement with results\nreported by Linn &amp; Doran (1984), with exception of\nMay 28 (Figure 1a).  These results confirm the higher\ncapacity of NT system to infiltrate and hold soil\nmoisture in relation to CT.  Higher WFPS differences\n(Figure 1a) between tillage systems occurred just after\nthe disk plow and harrow disk operations on the CT\nplot.  It is noteworthy that around 85 % of the total\nrainfall volume occurred after soil tillage.  Therefore,\nafter soil tillage, smaller WFPS values were found in\nCT compared to NT.  This result is probably associated\nto the wind effect that dried the bare soil surface of CT.\n\nA mean air temperature of 14 \u00b0C was registered\nduring the studied period, which is 13 % below the\nmean temperature registered for this month (16 \u00b0C).\nBesides, a high thermal amplitude was verified, since\nthe air temperatures ranged from 4 to 22 \u00b0C, with a\ndeclining trend throughout the experimental period.\nIn May, the soil temperature was similar in the two\ntillage systems.  However, measurements performed\nin the first week of June, after sowing, indicated a\nhigher soil temperature in the CT than the NT plot\n(Figure 1b).\n\nSoil CO2-C flux\n\nDaily soil CO2-C flux measured with the dynamic\nchamber in the NT plot ranged from 9 to 25 kg ha-1\n\nday-1, while soil flux in the CT ranged from 5 to\n20 kg ha-1 day-1 (Figure 2a).  Measurement results of\nthe static chamber indicated lower amplitudes than\nthe dynamic chamber, where results varied from 10\nto 22 kg ha-1 day-1 in NT and from 11 to 18 kg ha-1\n\nday-1 in CT soil (Figure 2b).\n\nA mean daily CO2-C flux of 12.7 \u00b1 2.2 kg ha\n-1 day-1\n\nwas measured with the dynamic chamber under CT\nand 15.7 \u00b1 2.9 kg ha-1 day-1 under NT (Figure 2a).  A\n19 % higher flux was observed in the NT than the CT\nplot, although this result was not significantly different\n(p > 0.05).  A similar trend was registered for the static\nchamber with a mean flux of 14.2 \u00b1 1.0 kg ha-1 day-1 in\nthe CT plot, compared to the 13.4 \u00b1 2.1 kg ha-1 day-1 in\nNT soil (Figure 2b).  With this chamber, the CO2-C\nflux in CT soil was 6 % higher than in NT, again\nwithout significant difference (p > 0.05).  The\nsimilarity in the mean soil CO2-C flux registered in\ntillage systems in a 30 day period agrees with results\nof a long-term evaluation previously reported by\nCampos (2006).  However, this author found a mean\nCO2-C flux of 24.4 kg ha\n\n-1 day-1 in CT and 26.0 kg ha-1 \n\nday-1 in NT soil in a two-year period, which exceeds\nthe results found here by 42 and 48 %, in the CT and\n\n\n\nCARBON DIOXIDE EFFLUX IN A RHODIC HAPLUDOX AS AFFECTED BY TILLAGE SYSTEMS...           329\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 33:325-334, 2009\n\nusing static chambers, found a mean soil CO2-C flux\nof 20 kg ha-1 day-1 during the growth period of alfalfa\n(Medicago sativa L.).  This value is closer to the highest\nCO2-C flux registered in May, and slightly lower than\nthe biannual flux reported by Campos (2006).\n\nThe mean separation procedure of the daily fluxes\nrevealed that differences in emissions induced by soil\ntillage system have a complex nature, due to the daily\nflux variability.  In the short term (single daily\nreadings), significant differences (p &lt;0.05) between\nsoil tillage systems were verified in the CO2-C flux,\nindependent of the soil chamber, mainly in the first\nweeks after tillage.  In the first two weeks of this\nstudy, NT had a higher soil CO2-C flux than CT, when\nevaluated by the dynamic chamber, which was more\nefficient than the static to capture the temporal flux\nvariability.  This result is probably related to several\naspects: the presence of easily decomposable soybean\nresidues on the soil surface, higher WFPS values\n(Figure 1a), higher stocks of labile soil organic carbon\n(Campos, 2006) and higher microbial biomass in NT\ncompared to CT, as reported previously at the same\nexperimental site (Fabrizzi et al., 2008).  The higher\nsoil CO2 \u2013 C flux under NT compared to CT, especially\nat sites under longstanding no-tillage systems, have\nbeen reported elsewhere (Yamulki &amp; Jarvis, 2002;\nCampos, 2006; Liu et al., 2006; Oorts et al., 2007).\nThis could be related to an improvement in soil quality\nand biomass input potential in the conservation\nsystem, compared to conventional systems (Amado et\nal., 2007).  In a 15-year-experiment, the soil CO2-C\nflux in NT growing black oat+common vetch/\nmaize+cowpea was 64.7 kg ha-1 day-1, while in NT\nwith black oat/maize the flux was 51.6 kg ha-1 day-1\n\nand in CT with black oat/maize 36.6 kg ha-1 day-1.\nThe soil CO2-C flux followed the order of soil quality\n(Amado et al., 2007).  The soil quality kit test guide\n(USDA, 1998) classifies a soil CO2-C flux of 35.8 to\n71.7 kg ha-1 day-1 as ideal and a range of 17.9 to\n35.8 kg ha-1 day-1 as medium.\n\nNT plots, respectively.  The lower soil temperature\nand absence of plant growth during the study period,\ncompared to the investigation of Campos (2006), could\nexplain the lower soil CO2-C flux.  Paul et al.

Bras. Ci. Solo, 33:325-334, 2009\n\nSoil tillage by disk plowing followed by disk\nharrowing as well as the sowing procedure, both in\nthe CT plot, resulted in changes in soil CO2-C flux.\nFluxes registered by the dynamic chamber in the CT\nplot had an irregular pattern with an increase of\naround 40 % after the last tillage operation, compared\nto the baseline CO2-C flux.  This increase in the flux\nis at least partially associated to an exposure of\noccluded particulate organic matter within the\naggregates (Six et al., 1998, 2006).  However, in our\nexperiment the increase in soil CO2-C flux induced by\ntillage was much lower than reported by Reicosky &amp;\nLindstrom (1993), in USA, in the first 24 h after\ntillage.  In an Oxisol in Southern Brazil, La Scala et\nal. (2006) also stated a higher CO2-C flux after tillage,\nwith CO2-C, values by up to 143 kg ha\n\n-1 day-1 higher.\nIt should be emphasized that although the soils here\nand in the study of La Scala et al. (2006) were similar,\nthe soil temperature in the two studies differed\nmarkedly, so the lower soil temperature during and\nafter tillage operations in our study could partially\nexplain the lower flux.  In the CT soil the CO2-C flux\nwas lower than under NT, mainly in the rainy period\n(just after tillage and shortly before sowing).  On the\nother hand, the CO2-C flux in NT was more stable\nduring the rainy period (Figures 1a and 2a).  The\nsowing procedure induced a significant increment of\n44 % soil CO2-C flux in both tillage systems.  This\nresult is associated with the reduced spacing between\nrows in winter crops (0.175 m), resulting in a\nconsiderable soil disturbance.\n\nThe dynamic chamber was more efficient than the\nstatic to capture short-term soil flux changes, e.g.,\nthose associated to the soil disturbances caused by\nplow and disk operations (Figure 2).  In CT soil, one\nday after plow tillage, the soil CO2-C flux decreased\nby more than 40 % (Figure 2a).  Therefore, soil C-CO2\nflux decreased from 13.6 to 5.1 kg ha-1 day-1, after a\nsoil temperature decline (from 15.9 to 12.5 \u00b0C)\n(Figure 1b) and mainly the WFPS decrease (from 48\nto 12 %) (Figure 1a).  In spite of an increase after\nplowing, the soil CO2-C flux in CT was lower than in\nNT (Figure 2a).  In this short-term study carried out\nduring the fall season the significant declines in soil\ntemperature and WFPS values probably affected the\nsoil biological activity and, consequently, CO2-C\nproduction and diffusive transport to a greater extent\nthan the expected tillage impact on flux.\n\nFifteen days after the beginning of the experiment,\nthe soil flux in the NT plot dropped to a lower value\nthan measured in the CT plot (Figure 2a).  The higher\ninitial CO2-C flux in NT can be associated to the input\nof soybean crop residues, 21 days before the experiment\nbegan.  The higher initial CO2-C flux in the\nconservation system could be explained by the low C/\nN ratio of this residue, high labile C contents and the\nmore favorable WFPS verified in the NT than in the\nCT plot (Figure 1a).  The decomposition of soybean\nresidues was fast, even when simply left on the soil\nsurface, as observed similarly by Campos (2006) at\n\nthe same site; the decay rate was more controlled by\nmoisture, temperature, pH and O2, and less by residue\nincorporation into soil by tillage.  In addition, Aita &amp;\nGiacomini (2007) reported that the effect of tillage to\nincrease the crop residue decomposition rate is\ninversely proportional to the N plant content.\n\nIn this study, the cumulative or total soil CO2-C\nflux CO2-C flux, during a 30 day period, was similar\nin the tillage systems, independent of the chamber\ntype (Figure 3).  Therefore, differences in CO2-flux\nbetween treatments (Figure 2) were restricted to short-\nterm periods, while no difference between treatments\nwas stated in the 30 day period.\n\nIn the measurements of the dynamic chamber, the\ntotal CO2-C flux in the NT plot was 471 kg ha\n\n-1 but\n381 kg ha-1 under CT (Figure 3).  These values are\nequivalent to approximately 28 and 18 % of the\nsoybean crop residue input (NT=1698 kg ha-1 C and\nCT = 2072 kg ha-1 C in the 2006/2007 growing\nseason), for NT and CT respectively.  Results of the\nstatic chamber indicated that 24 and 21 % of\naboveground C input by soybean crops evolved as\nCO2\u2013C flux under NT and CT respectively. Based on\ndecomposition equations of soybean residues (NT y =\nCo e-0.0085 t and CT y = Co e-0.0084 t) established by\nCampos (2006) at this site, a CO2-C flux of 382 and\n461 kg ha-1 from NT and CT soils, respectively, was\nestimated in a 30 day-period.  Therefore, the source\nof the greatest part of the CO2-C flux measured here\nwas probably the soybean residue decomposition.\nQuincke et al. (2007) reported a cumulative or total\nsoil CO2-C flux of 327 kg ha\n\n-1 from CT soil and\n227 kg ha-1 in the NT soil in a soybean/sorghum\nrotation in USA in a 30 day period after tillage,\nmeasured in a dynamic chamber.  These results are\nlower than the values found here.\n\nRelationships between soil CO2-C flux and\nsoil temperature and WFPS\n\nThere was an exponential increase in soil CO2-C\nflux with soil temperature (r = 0.91; p &lt;0.0001), and\n\nFigure 3.

Solo, 33:325-334, 2009\n\na linear relationship with soil WFPS (r = 0.79;\np &lt;0.0004) (Figure 4).  These relations were\nsignificant in the NT plot only and when measured\nin the dynamic chamber, which was more sensitive\nto changes of these variables than the static chamber.\n\nSimilarly as observed in this study, Janssens et\nal. (2001) reported that 80 % of temporal changes in\nsoil CO2-C flux could be ascribed to changes in soil\ntemperature, at adequate soil moisture.  Verma et al.\n(2005) and Costa et al. (2008) also observed a positive\ncorrelation between soil CO2-C flux and soil\ntemperature.  However, in a bare Oxisol, La Scala et\nal. (2000) found no correlation between CO2-C flux\nand soil temperature.  During this experiment, the\nNT plot maintained higher soil moisture with a mean\nWFPS of 37 % (Figure 1a).  This is probably the\nreason why soil temperature was detected as the main\ncontrol factor.  On the other hand, higher soil moisture\nvariation was registered in the CT plot, with a mean\nWFPS of only 25 % (Figure 1a), that may have\ninfluenced the relationship soil CO2-C - soil\ntemperature.  Linn &amp; Doran (1984) observed a higher\n\naerobic microbial activity, measured by the soil CO2-\nC flux, when the WFPS was close to 60 %.  The same\nauthors found the lowest soil CO2-C flux when WFPS\nwas around 30 %.\n\nAfter the exponential model linearization, a model\nLn(E CO2-C ) = a + bTSOIL was obtained (Figure 4a).  In\nthis study Q10 was calculated by the following\nmathematical expression: Q10 = e\n\n10b, and the value\nfound was 3.93.  This result is in the range of 1.3 to\n5.1 reported by Conant et al. (2004) in USA soils.\nThese authors found higher Q10 values when\ntemperatures were lower, in agreement with Lloyd &amp;\nTaylor (1994).\n\nComparison of soil CO2-C flux measured by\nstatic and dynamic chambers\n\nThe correlation between CO2-C flux obtained from\nthe two chambers was linear in the NT plot (r = 0.78;\np &lt;0.02) (Figure 5), while in the CT plot this\nrelationship was not significant.  Under NT, the static\nchamber underestimated the CO2-C flux registered\nby the dynamic chamber, especially when flux was\nclose or superior to 20 kg ha-1 day-1.  Jensen et al.\n(1996) comparing static and dynamic chambers in CT\nagriculture and under forest and pasture ecosystems\nin temperate climate found an exponential\nrelationship (r= 0.84).  Therefore, when soil surface\nCO2-C flux rates measured by the dynamic method\nwere above 24 kg ha-1 day-1 CO2-C, they were up to\nfive times higher than by the static method.\nTherefore, these authors also reported that when CO2-\nC fluxes are high, measurements by the static chamber\nunderestimate the ones by the dynamic chamber, as\nverified in this study.\n\nWhen the soil CO2-C flux is low the static chamber\ncan overestimate the flux in relation to the dynamic\n\nFigure 4.

(1996) reported that some static chamber,\nare not able to full integrate CO2\u2013C flux in a one-day-\nperiod.   Besides, the larger spatial variability observed\nwith the dynamic chamber requires a large number\nof replications to obtain reliable estimates of the mean\nsoil CO2-C flux.  This limitation was probably reduced\nin our study, at least during the tillage operation,\nwhen 5 and 11 measurements were performed on the\ndays of disk plowing and harrowing, respectively, and\nwere reduced to a frequency of 2 daily measurements\n(9\u201310 and 15\u201316 h) after that.  However, no\nmeasurements were performed with the dynamic\nchamber at night.\n\nThe dynamic compared to the static chamber is\nmore appropriate to detect spatial and temporal\nvariability in studies that relate soil CO2-C flux with\nsoil temperature and WFPS.  Using the dynamic\nchamber it is possible to sample a high number of\npoints in a short time (La Scala et al., 2006).  This\nfact probably helped to establish a significant\nrelationship between CO2-C flux and abiotic factors\n(temperature and WFPS) by the dynamic but not the\nstatic chamber.  On the other hand, the static chamber\nmaintained in the soil for 24 h has the advantage of\nintegrating the daily CO2-C flux and is probably more\nadequate for long-term studies, for instance, related\nto crop residue decomposition and labile C fraction\ndecay in soil organic matter.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n1. The total soil CO2\u2013C flux in a 30 day period\nwas similar in no-till and conventional tillage,\nindependent of the chamber type.  The differences in\nCO2-C flux between tillage systems were related to\nthe day of observation; the differences were higher in\nthe first weeks after tillage.  The restricted impact of\nsoil tillage in CO 2-C flux was associated to\npredominant climatic conditions of low soil\ntemperature and water-filled pore space during the\nexperimental period (autumn).\n\n2. The dynamic chamber was more efficient than\nthe static to detect rapid changes in soil CO2-C flux\ndriven by abiotic factors.  Soil CO2-C flux in the no-\ntill plot increased exponentially with soil temperature\nand linearly with water-filled pore space and these\nproperties explained most of the temporal flux\nvariability.  The CO2-C flux was more sensitive to\nsoil temperature than to water-filled pore space during\nthe fall period evaluated in southern Brazil.\n\n3. Only in the no-till system the static chamber\nCO2-C flux measurements were linearly related to\nthose of the dynamic chamber.  In this case of high\nCO2-C flux the static chamber underestimated the\nflux registered by the dynamic chamber.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe authors are indebted to the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de\nAmparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul\n(FAPERGS), Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento\nCient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico (CNPq) and Minist\u00e9rio da\nCi\u00eancia e Tecnologia (MCT) for financial support of\nthe research project PRONEX \u201cSequestro de carbono\ne mitiga\u00e7\u00e3o das emiss\u00f5es de gases de efeito estufa por\nsistemas conservacionistas de manejo e as\noportunidades para o agroneg\u00f3cio no RS\u201d.\n\nLITERATURE CITED\n\nAITA, C. &amp; GIACOMINI, S.J.
