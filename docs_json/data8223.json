These moments are consistent \n\nwith the construction of a plain grave\u2019s necropolis, probably forming familiar clusters, a hypothetic pits\u2019 necropolis and, \n\nprior to the abandonment of the area, an \u201cenclosure\u201d. \n\nGiven the interpretations presented we have discussed the possible relation between the local, certain physical charac-\n\nteristics and the presence of funerary practices. As a work hypothesis we consider those relations as fundamental for the \n\nplaces\u2019 choice. Alongside with other evidence of difficult interpretation and, perhaps, in the context of new senses \n\nmeanwhile acquired by this place, these data form part of this place\u2019s biography. \n\nKeywords: Portuguese Northwest, Bronze Age, necropolis, flat graves, pits, ceramic depositions, deathscape. \n\nResumo: Entre o vale e o monte. Refletindo sobre a import\u00e2ncia espacial da necr\u00f3pole da Idade do Bronze do \nPego, Braga (Noroeste de Portugal) \n\nO presente trabalho apresenta os dados de escava\u00e7\u00e3o relativos ao Sector II do Pego, \u00e1rea onde foram identificadas, entre \n\noutras, evid\u00eancias de pr\u00e1ticas funer\u00e1rias da Idade do Bronze. \n\nCom base na escolha do local, nas carater\u00edsticas arquitet\u00f3nicas das estruturas, nas suas inter-rela\u00e7\u00f5es, nos materiais a \n\nelas associados, na sua estratigrafia e nas datas de radiocarbono dispon\u00edveis s\u00e3o propostos diferentes usos e fases de \n\nocupa\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nEmbora certas materialidades denunciem presen\u00e7a humana posterior, a frequ\u00eancia da \u00e1rea denuncia quatro momentos \n\nde ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o dat\u00e1veis entre o Bronze M\u00e9dio e o Bronze Final. Esses momentos s\u00e3o compat\u00edveis com a constru\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\numa necr\u00f3pole de sepulturas planas, qui\u00e7\u00e1 formando n\u00facleos familiares, com uma hipot\u00e9tica necr\u00f3pole de fossas e, \n\nantes do abandono do local, com um \u201crecinto\u201d. \n\nAtendendo ao quadro interpretativo apresentado, discute-se a poss\u00edvel rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre o local, certas carater\u00edsticas do meio \n\ne os vest\u00edgios das a\u00e7\u00f5es funer\u00e1rias.

So just as we cannot look back at the ancient past and imagine that those people understood their own \n\nbodies in the same way as we do in the present, we equally cannot imagine that the significance of material culture is fixed and \n\nchangeless\u201d. \n \n\nJulian Thomas (2005: 17) \n\n \n\n\u201cAny form of life is created by a dialogical encounter between past and present, as past meanings derived from past experience are \n\ntested against the exigencies of the present\u201d. \n \n\nChristopher Gosden (1994: 52) \n\n\n\nHugo Aluai Sampaio &amp; Ana M.S. Bettencourt \n\n46 \n\nThe subsequent works continued under the \n\ndoctoral thesis project submitted by one of the \n\nsigners\n2 \n\n(H.A.S.), entitled Bronze Age places in \n\nthe river Ave\u2019s basin. More recently, this work  \n\nintegrated the interdisciplinary project named \n\nNatural Spaces, Architectures, Rock Carvings \n\nand Depositions of the Western Fa\u00e7ade of the \n\nCentral-Northern Portugal Late Prehistory: \n\nfrom Agencies to Meanings\n3\n, equally lead by \n\none of the authors (A.M.S.B.). \n\nFrom these  different  works  resulted two \n\npublications (SAMPAIO et al. 2008; SAMPAIO &amp; \n\nBETTENCOURT 2011) and the preparation of a \n\nmonograph  chapter  is  to  be  included  in  the \n\naforementioned doctoral thesis. \n\nThe  campaigns  developed  between  2003 \n\nand 2010 enabled the recovery of an important \n\nset of information significantly relevant for the \n\nBronze  Age  understanding.  Although  some \n\nevidence  identified  in  other  areas  of  the  site \n\ndenounce  different  activities,  some  of  which \n\ndatable  from  historic  phases,  this  work  will \n\nonly  focus in the so-called Sector  II.  In that \n\narea,  corresponding  to  the  South  slope  of  a \n\nknoll and alongside with Bronze Age mortuary \n\npractices, other activities have occurred, which \n\nits  interpretation  is  complex.  Altogether  its \n\nanalysis may contribute to a better knowledge \n\nof  the  Northwestern  Iberian  Bronze  Age \n\nfunerary contexts and practices. \n\n \n2. LOCATION AND PHYSICAL CONTEXT \n\n \n\nThe site of Pego is located in Souto, \n\nparish of Cunha, county and district of Braga, \n\nin the North of Portugal. According to the \n\nWorld Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) is \n\npositioned at the geographic coordinates of \n\n41, 4939 N and -8, 5206 W (Fig. 1). \n \n\n2\n Ph.D. scholarship granted by Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia (ref.

Discoursing on the spatial importance  of Pego\u2019s Bronze Age necropolis, Braga \n\n(Northwest of Portugal) \n\n47 \n\nIt occupies a little knoll with 150 meters of \n\nmaximum altitude that corresponds to a flattened \n\nspur. This knoll integrates a wider mount that from \n\nSequeira grows in that direction, reaching the \n\n220/240 meters of altitude. \n\nThe knoll is flanked from East by the \n\nLevegada\u2019s stream. Its valley is mainly developed \n\nfrom Northeast to Southwest, coursing between \n\nmoderate granitic reliefs lower than 270 meters of \n\naltitude, and joining the river Este at about 1 km to \n\nSouth. As so, Pego integrates the river Ave\u2019s basin \n\n(Fig. 2).  Not far to the Southwest it was possible to \n\nidentify a paleochannel, cut in the edge of a nearby \n\npathway owned by a local home-keeper. It is likely \n\nthat this paleochannel might have been active during \n\nthe Bronze Age. Within 50 meters to the North there \n\nis known to be a potable water source. \n\nThis positioning allows for excellent \n\nvisibility conditions, in particular between the \n\nNortheast and the South. Concretely, to the wider \n\nalluvial valley of Levegada\u2019s stream, with \n\nsprawled banks on which proliferate suitable \n\nagricultural soils. \n\nThe local rock substratum is mainly \n\nconstituted by biotitic monzogranites, with rare \n\nmuscovite, porphyroids, of coarse grains, often \n\noutcropping (TEIXEIRA &amp; MEDEIROS 1969). The \n\nregional climatic conditions impel the bedrock \n\nmeteorization, in many cases promoting its \n\narenization (GON\u00c7ALVES 2013). \n\nFig. 2. Hypsometric map with Pego\u2019s location towards the nearby hydrological and tin (at yellow) sources. \n\nFig. 2. Mapa hipsom\u00e9trico com a localiza\u00e7\u00e3o do Pego em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos recursos hidrol\u00f3gicos e mineiros (a amarelo) imediatos. \n\nAnalysing the Portuguese Geological Charts, \n\nsheets 5-C from Barcelos (TEIXEIRA &amp; MEDEIROS \n\n1969), 5-D from Braga (FERREIRA et al. 2000), 9-\n\nA from P\u00f3voa de Varzim (TEIXEIRA &amp; MEDEIROS \n\n1965) and 9-B from Guimar\u00e3es (ANDRADE &amp; \n\nNORONHA 1986), at the scale of 1/50.000, it is \n\npossible to identify several ore resources in a \n\nradius inferior to 25 km: at a maximum of 13 km to \n\nthe Northeast \u2013 the tin-mining complex of \n\nNegreiros (Barcelos) / Lousado (Vila Nova de \n\nFamalic\u00e3o); at about 8 km to the Southwest \u2013 the \n\ntin-mining resources spread between Cabreiros and \n\nPadim da Gra\u00e7a (Braga); at about 19 km to the \n\nSouth \u2013 the tin mines of Parada de Gatim / \n\nCabanelas (Vila Verde); and at about 25 km to the \n\nSouth \u2013 the gold minerals of Portela das Cabras \n\n(Vila Verde) (Fig. 2). The proximity of the rivers \n\nC\u00e1vado, Ave and Este, waterways of considerable \n\ndynamic available at about 10 km, also facilitated \n\nthe gathering of alluvial native minerals like gold, \n\nsilver and tin (Fig. 2). \n\nAlthough tendentiously sparse, the current \n\n\n\nHugo Aluai Sampaio &amp; Ana M.S. Bettencourt \n\n48 \n\nmethods in order to minimize the lack of \n\ninformation. The excavation in plan (and not \n\nsectioned) of the structures\u2019 stratigraphy allowed, \n\nin some cases, the identification of organic \n\nmatter\u2019s concentration distributed in the central \n\narea of some structures. This concentration of \n\norganic matter was linked to the corpses\u2019 decay \n\ninside the grave. \n\nWe also focused on the materials deposited \n\ninside those structures, whose origin we related \n\ndirectly to the funerary practices which occurred in \n\nthis space. In this sense, the analytical observation \n\nof the ceramic vessels recovered inside each grave \n\ntook into account some technical, morphological \n\nand stylistic aspects, so as their positioning inside \n\nall structures. \n\nSeeking to clarify the internal organization of \n\nthat area and to assess the necropolis\u2019 spatial and \n\nsocial organization, we have considered the \n\ninterrelations between structures, between groups \n\nof structures and between ceramic depositions. \n\nSimultaneously, we prioritize the necropolis\u2019 \n\nchronological dating and the identification of \n\ndifferent occupation moments. These moments, \n\ndatable back to the Bronze Age, were also object \n\nof scrutiny, in order to identify any traces of \n\ncontinuity or disruption amidst them. This was \n\nsupported by radiometric dating that ground the \n\nproposed chronology. \n\nWe also took into account the necropolis\u2019 \n\npositioning in relation to the knoll and to some \n\nnatural elements, such as watercourses and solar \n\ncycles.  \n\nFinally, and based on the Peninsular \n\nNorthwestern Bronze Age occupation, we \n\nattempted some parallels with other known \n\ncoetaneous places. \n \n\n \n4. DATA \n \n\nThe earliest occupation of Sector II is \n\nrelated with the construction of 13 plain graves. \n\nThe layouts of those structures reveal a common \n\norientation, aligning their longer axis from the \n\nNortheast towards the Southwest. \n\nTheir shapes are predominantly \n\nsubrectangular, only oval in graves 4 and 10. All \n\nthe sections are in \u201cU\u201d and their bases are \n\nflattened, except in graves 8, 9, 10 and 11, which \n\nare rounded. \n\nThey exhibit variable measures of length, \n\nheight and depth, ranging between 130-245 cm, \n\n40-90 cm and 12-40 cm, respectively (Tab. 1). \n\nThe absence of osteological remains \n\ndisabled the identification of their heads. \n\nHowever, we identified inside the fillings of \n\ngraves 9 and 11, during the excavation in plan \n\nand in central positioning, different layers that \n\nsuggest them. This may be inferred by a dark \n\ncoloration, which we relate with the presence of \n\nland cover is formed by arboreal, shrubby and \n\nherbaceous species, and the nearest terrains \n\nlocated on lower altitudes, close to the river \n\nEste\u2019s valley, as already said, are suitable for \n\nagriculture. \n\nA dozen meters to the Southwest are \n\nknown the archaeological sites of Frij\u00e3o I and \n\nFrij\u00e3o II, dating back to Bronze and Iron Age, \n\nrespectively (BARBOSA &amp; AZEVEDO 2004-\n\n2005).  \n\n \n3. METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH \n\n \n\nTheoretically the dynamic concept of \n\nlandscape is assumed according to Ingold (2000), \n\nperceived as the dialectic result between the human \n\nagency and the physical scenario where man lives. \n\nThe landscape is also the perception and the \n\nexperience that communities obtain and create \n\nfrom the surrounding world. As so, it is a complex \n\nand a permanently (re)constructed element which \n\nactuates many times as an agent. \n\nInherent to its existence in the world, man \n\nembodies and recreates different places. These \n\nknown, experienced and practiced places promote \n\nthe sense of belonging and social integration, \n\nculminating in the attainment of a sense of place \n\n(FELD &amp; BASSO 1996; VAN DYKE &amp; ALCOCK \n\n2003). Their frequency and use is connected with \n\nactions, histories, memories, feelings and \n\nmeanings, allowing for populations to develop an \n\nemotional relation to different places. \n\nThe experienced loci become significant, \n\nincorporating individual and collective memories. \n\nSometimes, its uses, frequencies and alterations \n\nleft \u201creadable\u201d archaeological traces. Therefore, \n\nthe recurrent use of particular places enables the \n\nconstruction of memoryscapes, where people, \n\nagencies and memories converge (CLACK 2011). \n\nThe specific case of Pego takes the form of \n\ndeathscape (COOK 2011: 14), a place where the \n\nperformance of \u201cmechanisms in the construction \n\nand negotiation of identity, heritage and attitudes \n\ntowards death\u201d led to the creation of a place for \n\ndeath. Like Thomas (2001: 175) wrote, landscape \n\nallows for the permanent remembrance of the \n\nrelation between the living and the deceased \n\ngenerations and consequently between lines of \n\naffiliation and succession. \n\nBased on these assumptions this work \n\nprioritized both micro and intrasite scales of \n\nanalysis. Firstly, we observed independently the \n\nstructures\u2019 features, focusing their constructive \n\nelements. Their shape, depth, spatial orientation, \n\nstratigraphy and covering was carefully analyzed \n\nand compared. \n\nThe performed rites were another \n\ncontemplated item. The absence of osteological \n\nremains, due to the Portuguese Northwestern soils\u2019 \n\ntypical acidness, forced us to pursue new work \n\n\n\nBetween thee valley and the hill top. Discoursing on the spatial importance  of Pego\u2019s Bronze Age necropolis, Braga \n\n(Northwest of Portugal) \n\n49 \n\nThe top of graves 3, 8, 9, 10 and 11 was \n\nsealed with a layer of gravel (Fig.5). \n\nUnfortunately, the level of destruction of the \n\nremaining graves precluded the observation of the \n\nsame type of cover. At the top of the Southwest \n\nedge of grave 11 was found an angular granitic \n\npebble nailed into the soil, making its \n\ninterpretation difficult. \n\norganic matter and resulting from the corpses\u2019 \n\ndecaying (Fig. 4). \n\nStructure Shape Section Base Lenght \n\n(cm) \n\nWidth \n\n(cm) \n\nDepth \n\n(cm) \n\nOrientation \n\nGrave 1 Subrectangular U Flattened 206 62 20/32 NE/SW \n\nGrave 2 Subrectangular U Flattened 212 40/86 14/30 NE/SW \n\nGrave 3 Subrectangular U Flattened 245 56 21/30 NE/SW \n\nGrave 4 Ovoid U Flattened 130 60 16 NE/SW \n\nGrave 5 Subrectangular U Flattened 120 46 13/22 NE/SW \n\nGrave 6 Subrectangular U Flattened 180 80 10/32 NE/SW \n\nGrave 7 Subrectangular U Flattened 224 72 12/20 NE/SW \n\nGrave 8 Subrectangular U Rounded 202 62 28/34 NE/SW \n\nGrave 9 Subrectangular U Rounded 215 80 30 NE/SW \n\nGrave 10 Subrectangular U Rounded 210 70 40 NE/SW \n\nGrave 11 Subrectangular U Rounded 200 70 36 NE/SW \n\nGrave 12 Subrectangular U Flattened 30 90 24 NE/SW \n\nGrave 13 I.N.A.

Amidst opposite ends of different \n\ngraves we can only register 40 cm between \n\ngraves 11 and 12. Except for graves 7 and 12\n4\n, \n\nall the others included ceramic vessels with flat \n\nedges (form 13 from BETTENCOURT 1999). \n\nThese vessels were all recovered at the South-\n\nwest end of the graves\n5\n (Fig. 6). \n\nThe  positioning  of  their  handles  inside \n\ndifferent  structures  was  variable,  whereby  no \n\nregularity  was  identified.  Only  the  vessel  of \n\ngrave 9 held external wall burnished and inter-\n\nnal  wall  smoothed,  while  the  others  have \n\nsmoother finishing both on internal and external \n\nwalls. Technical features and decorative com-\n\npositions  analysis  allowed  some  inferences. \n\nHowever, for the prior reported reasons, grave \n\n12 was not contemplated.  All the decorations \n\nwere  distributed  in  metopes  and  demonstrate \n\nsignificant complexity. The most frequent deco-\n\nration techniques conjugate the of use impres-\n\nsion and incision, although in the vessel from \n\ngrave  8 impression  and  plastic  addition tech-\n\nniques  were  simultaneously  used,  the  later  in \n\nthe form of slightly prominent stands transver-\n\nsal to the lip. Likewise, only in the vessel of \n\ngrave 11 the use of impression is present. In-\n\ndeed, this was taken as the \u201csimplest\u201d composi-\n\ntion. Graves 7 and 8 also stand out, since their \n\nfillings included the deposition of a loom weight \n\nor net weight and a spindle whorl or bead (Fig. 7). \n\nNucleus 2 occupied the Southwest area, \n\nslightly below nucleus 1, and included graves 1, \n\n2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 (Fig. 8). The lateral height be-\n\ntween graves 3 and 6 reached about 140 cm and \n\namong graves 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 about 120 cm. \n\nBetween the opposite ends of graves 2 and 5 the \n\nmaximum height was registered, 70 cm. Except \n\nfor graves 1 and 4 all the others contained a \n\nceramic vessel inside their fillings.  In graves 3 \n\nand 6 these were deposited in the Southwest \n\nquadrant, whilst in graves 2 and 5 in their \n\nNortheast end (Fig. 6). The position of the han-\n\ndles was variable, and no regularity was ob-\n\nserved. The internal and external walls of all \n\nthe vessels denounce a smoothed finishing. \n\nLike nucleus 1, the decorative compositions \n\nalso denote the use of metopes, in some cases \n\nevidencing significant complexity, prevailing \n\nthe conjugation of incision and impression tech-\n\nniques. Whereby, only the vessel from grave 5 \n\ndenoted simultaneously the application of inci-\n\nsion and plastic addition, the later taking the \n\nform of slightly prominent protuberances. Like-\n\nwise, only the vase from grave 2 denoted the \n\nuse of impression, exhibiting the \u201csimplest\u201d \n\ndecorative composition. \n\nOther signs of occupation are materialized \n\nby the presence of 6 pits dug on the rocky sub-\n\nstratum. These were located very close to plain \n\ngraves, in some cases even overlapping them \n\n(Fig. 8). The majority held an oval shape, with \n\nlength, widths and depth ranging between 60-78 \n\ncm, 32-52 cm and 30-68 cm, respectively (Tab. \n\n2). \n\n4\n Nevertheless, we must underline that the excavation of grave 12 was not completed. From its fillings we recovered three pot sherds apparently belonging to \n\nanother flat edge vessel. Numerous eucalyptus roots are responsible for the disturbance of this structure, especially its Northeast quadrant. This occurrence \n\ndoes not invalidate the possibility of another deposition of a vessel inside this structure.  \n5\n In grave 8 it was not possible to recover the vessel in its original position, since a massive root disturbed its Southwest quadrant. The vessel was recovered in \n\ndispersed sherds, which permit to consider its original deposition in that area of the grave.  \n\n\n\nBetween thee valley and the hill top. Discoursing on the spatial importance  of Pego\u2019s Bronze Age necropolis, Braga \n\n(Northwest of Portugal) \n\n53 \n\nPit 4 may correspond to a first pit later \n\ncut by another similar structure, as appar-\n\nently prevail its original interface in the \n\nSoutheast quadrant. It held 120 cm in length, \n\n56 cm in weight and 24 to 48 cm of depth. Pit \n\n5, substantially different from the others, had \n\na circular shape with 124 cm of diameter and \n\nreached a maximum depth of 32 cm. Its most \n\nparticularity was to overlap grave 11, cutting \n\nits Southwest end. Beside no evidence of de-\n\nbris in their fillings, the top of pits 1, 2 and 5 \n\nwere sealed with a gravel layer (Fig. 9), \n\nwhereas pits 1, 2 and 4 were marked with an \n\nangular granitic pebble at their top.  \n\nPit 1 included roughly in its middle a subcir-\n\ncular four stones arrangement, three of which were \n\nnon local granites with high percentage of biotite. \n\nThis feature conferred to those stones a black \n\nglassed appearance. Hypothetically, this arrange-\n\nment could have served as base to host something, \n\nlike a body, bones or any other perishable offer-\n\nings. \n\nIn general the materials recovered inside their \n\nfillings did not abound: from pit 1 only a pot sherd \n\nbelonging to a belly was recovered; in pit 2 a piece \n\nof yellow dye was identified; and from pit 3 some \n\npot sherds that allowed the partial reconstruction of \n\na little pot\u2019s profile were exhumed. \n\n \n\n \n5. C\n\n14\n DATES AND OCCUPATION PHASES \n\n \n\nIt was an option to date scraped residues of \n\nsoot identified in the internal wall of the vessel de-\n\nposited in grave 9. The carbon dating results situated \n\nthe plain graves of this context between the XVIII \n\nand XV centuries BC, that is, in the second quarter \n\nof the I\n \nmillennium BC and in what is generically \n\naccepted as regional Middle Bronze Age (Tab. 3). \n\nSuch chronology is compatible with other flat \n\nedge  vessels  recovered  elsewhere  in  the  river \n\nAve\u2019s basin, like Quinta do Amorim 2 (SAMPAIO et \n\nal.  2014),  for  example.  Therefore,  the previous \n\nproposed chronology for that area of Pego is re-\n\nceded, since it was prior ascribed to Late Bronze \n\nAge (SAMPAIO et al. 2008; BETTENCOURT 2010).  \n\nFig. 9.

Data\u00e7\u00e3o por AMS da sepultura 9 \n\nThe structures\u2019 spatial distribution and inter-\n\nrelation analysis allows for the understanding of its \n\nchronological sequence. Therefore, the plain grave \n\n11 was cut by pit 5, corroborating the older con-\n\nstruction of the later structure. The cut of the \n\nSouthwest end of grave 1 happened in a later \n\nphase, during the construction of the perimeter \n\nditch. And pit 6 was covered with gravel that also \n\nresulted from the opening on the rock substratum \n\nof that perimeter ditch. \n\nTherefore, based on the stratigraphic record, \n\nthe interrelation between structures, in the recov-\n\nered materials and in the available carbon dating \n\nresults we have proposed four different occupation \n\nmoments for the South slope of Pego\u2019s site. \n\nThe first moment dates back, at least, to the \n\nMiddle Bronze Age, specifically, to the second \n\nquarter of the II millennium BC (XVIII-XV centu-\n\nries BC). This occupation phase corresponds to the \n\nconstruction of a plain grave\u2019s necropolis. A latter \n\nmoment is related with a hypothetical pit\u2019s ne-\n\ncropolis that was constructed in the immediate area \n\nof the plain graves. Although there are no carbon \n\ndating results available that securely confirm their \n\nchronology, based on the interrelations between \n\nstructures listed above one can situate them be-\n\ntween the second and the fourth quarter of the II \n\nmillennium BC, that is, between the XVIII-XV \n\ncenturies BC (date from the plain grave\u2019s necropo-\n\nlis) and XII-X centuries BC (date from the perime-\n\nter ditch\u2019s opening). Subsequent moments date \n\nback to Late Bronze Age, more precisely, from \n\nbetween the XII-X centuries BC and IX-V centu-\n\nries BC (SAMPAIO et al. 2008). These moments \n\n\n\nHugo Aluai Sampaio &amp; Ana M.S. Bettencourt \n\n54 \n\nwere matched to the opening and closure of the \n\nperimeter ditch that surrounded the knoll. \n\n \n6. FROM THE CONSTRUCTION OF A PLAIN \n\nGRAVE\u2019S NECROPOLIS TO ITS TRANSFOR-\n\nMATION IN AN ENCLOSURE \n\n \nThe absence of osteological remains requires \n\nsome explanation that support the interpretation of \n\ncertain structures as plain graves and the South \n\nslope of Pego (Sector II) as a necropolis. These \n\nassumptions were based upon the shapes, the con-\n\ntours, the dimensions, the stratigraphy and the ma-\n\nterials deposited inside those fillings\u2019 structures. \n\nIt was referred that during the excavation in \n\nplan of graves 9 and 11 were individualized dark \n\nlayers. Their central distribution was related with \n\nthe decomposition of the deceased. As such, it is \n\nfeasible to hypothesize that each of these graves \n\nhosted a primary inhumation. \n\nThe compact gravel layer identified on top of \n\ngraves 3, 8, 9, 10 and 11 suggests their sealing with \n\nthis kind of material. \n\nOther coetaneous contexts like Pego, where \n\nsimilar plain graves were identified, are known in \n\nthe Northwestern Iberian Peninsula: Tapado da \n\nCaldeira, in Bai\u00e3o (JORGE 1980a, 1980b, 1983, \n\n1985); Cimalha, in Felgueiras (ALMEIDA &amp; FER-\n\nNANDES 2007, 2008; ALMEIDA et al. 2008); Alto \n\nda Vela/Gulpilhares, in Vila Nova de Gaia \n\n(FORTES 1909); Quinta do Amorim 2, in Braga \n\n(SAMPAIO et al. 2013); Coto da Laborada, Calvos \n\nde Rand\u00edn (L\u00d3PEZ CUEVILLAS 1930, 1947; L\u00d3PEZ \n\nCUEVILLAS &amp; LORENZO FERN\u00c1NDEZ 1930); or \n\nMonte de Mesiego, O Carballi\u00f1o (LOPEZ CUEVI-\n\nLLAS &amp; LAMAS 1958). \n\nThe presence of flat edged ceramic vessels \n\ninside the great majority of these graves enhances \n\nthe sepulchral nature of this context. In Northwest-\n\nern Iberia there other necropolis where these kind \n\nof ceramic forms were exhumed: Belinho, in \n\nEsposende (ALMEIDA 1986); Monte da Ola, in \n\nViana do Castelo (PA\u00c7O 1933; DINIS &amp; BETTEN-\n\nCOURT 2004); Fa\u00edsca, in Guimar\u00e3es (CARDOSO \n\n1936); Cimalha, in Felgueiras (ALMEIDA &amp; FER-\n\nNANDES 2007, 2008; ALMEIDA et al. 2008); Alto \n\nda Vela/Gulpilhares, in Vila Nova de Gaia \n\n(FORTES 1909); or Coto da Laborada, in Calvos de \n\nRand\u00edn (L\u00d3PEZ CUEVILLAS 1930). We can also \n\nhighlight the necropolis of Agra de Antas, in \n\nEsposende, where osteological remains were re-\n\ncovered (ATA\u00cdDE &amp; TEIXEIRA 1940; CRUZ &amp; GON-\n\n\u00c7ALVES 1998/1999; BETTENCOURT 1999; CUNHA \n\n&amp; BETTENCOURT 2013). \n\nAttending to the general similitude observed \n\nbetween graves it is feasible to assert that during \n\nthe Middle Bronze Age a plain grave necropolis at \n\nPego\u2019s Southern slope was built. This necropolis \n\nhosted primary inhumations deposited in lateral \n\ndecubitus \u2013 at least in two cases, graves 9 and 11 \u2013, \n\nsealed with gravel layers and containing, in most \n\ncases, ceramic offerings and, more rarely, other \n\nobjects. \n\nThe angular pebble identified at the South-\n\nwest top of grave 11, interpreted as a marking ele-\n\nment, lead us to hypothesize that some of these \n\nstructures may have been marked with perishable \n\nmaterials and/or additional structures. \n\nTheir organization in clusters enables us to \n\nquestion if their disposition can represent familiar \n\ngroups. The answer is not easy but the analysis of \n\nthe decorative techniques and compositions of the \n\nceramic vessels appear to show that in each nu-\n\ncleus prevails heterogeneity on the decorative tech-\n\nniques and patterns. This may indicate distinct \n\nelements of a family, according to a subdivision \n\nrespecting the age, gender or other attributes/\n\npredicates. We also denote that there are recur-\n\nrences in each nucleus, related with vessels\u2019 posi-\n\ntioning and certain decorations. That is, each nu-\n\ncleus includes a vessel decorated with plastic addi-\n\ntion; one vessel decorated only by impression of \n\ndiagonal metopes and graves with absence of ves-\n\nsels occupied identical intra-nucleus positions. It \n\nseems reasonable to interpret either nucleus as a \n\ndifferent familiar group, albeit deriving from the \n\nsame community, with specific norms/standards \n\ntowards death. The humble dimensions of this \n\nplace and the lack of superimpositions between \n\nstructures may corroborate the construction and \n\nfrequency of this necropolis by one single commu-\n\nnity. \n\nThe location of this necropolis, between the \n\ntop of the hill and the valley, in the South slope of \n\na little knoll, its closeness to a nearby watercourse \n\nflowing from the North/Northeast to the South/\n\nSouthwest, and its viewing of the Levegada\u2019s \n\nstream were some of the physical features consid-\n\nered important. According to Tim Ingold\u2019s land-\n\nscape concept (INGOLD 2000) these may not be \n\nrandom items. On the contrary, probably these \n\nwere foundational factors taken into account dur-\n\ning the choice of this locus for its use to perform \n\nsepulchral practices. As such, these factors were \n\nagents riddled with cultural and symbolic signifi-\n\ncances. \n\nThe preferential area chosen for the construc-\n\ntion of the necropolis was the sunny quadrant of \n\nthe knoll, facing the South. Can the manorial char-\n\nacteristics of this area, well illuminated from sun \n\nrise to sunset, reveal any association between the \n\nsolar cycles and death and life cycles? We do not \n\nknow, but this work hypothesis can be raised, al-\n\nbeit more data is needed to corroborate its veracity. \n\nCould the similarity between Levegada\u2019s stream \n\nand the graves\u00b4 orientations (Northeast-Southwest) \n\nindicate any association between the flow of the \n\nwaters and the journey to death? We also do not \n\nknow. \n\nBesides, the necropolis occupied the soft \n\n\n\nBetween thee valley and the hill top. Discoursing on the spatial importance  of Pego\u2019s Bronze Age necropolis, Braga \n\n(Northwest of Portugal) \n\n55 \n\nslope of the knoll, in the area with the best access \n\nto the nearest fertile valleys. It is located between \n\nthe valley and the hill top, in a liminal position, \n\nthat is, a passage area between low and higher \n\nlands. Can this physical characteristic be associated \n\nwith death, also seen as a passage between two \n\nworlds? It seems likely since it is a recurrent location \n\nobserved in other necropolis that we are studying. \n\nIt is curious to register that at the top of the \n\nknoll no necropolis\u2019 coetaneous occupation was \n\nidentified. This may lead us to consider the South \n\nslope of Pego as a deathscape in the sense of Clack \n\n(2011), that is, an area where actions and memories \n\ntowards death took place. Only this way Pego \n\ncould be articulated with other nearest significant \n\nand experienced places from the Middle Bronze \n\nAge landscape. Probably recurrently used as a ne-\n\ncropolis, this place subsisted in the everyday life, \n\nat least, for some time. We do not know if its mem-\n\nory remained active and if Pego became a memory-\n\nscape, that is, a place of people\u2019s, agencies\u2019 and \n\nmemories\u2019 convergence in its large duration. The \n\nvarious occupations identified dating back from \n\nbetween the II and the I millenniums BC, as we \n\nshall see, prove that Pego was occupied several \n\ntimes. \n\nThe presence of pits in the plain graves ne-\n\ncropolis\u2019 area is enigmatic. No specific spatial \n\ndisposition stands out, but its proximity to one \n\ncluster (nucleus 1) is clear. Although the absence \n\nof osteological remains incites to careful interpre-\n\ntations, funerary pits\u2019 contexts in the Northwestern \n\nIberia are known. We may refer, for example, \n\nFraga do Zorro, in Ver\u00edn (F\u00c1BREGAS VALCARCE \n\n2001; PRIETO MART\u00cdNEZ et al. 2009), or Medal, in \n\nMougadouro, this last site recently discovered and \n\npresented\n6\n. \n\nThe sealing of pits 1, 2 and 5 with gravel and \n\nthe marking of pits 1, 2 and 4 with an angular peb-\n\nble resemble some plain graves characteristics, and \n\nmay denounce analogous purposes. We also need \n\nto refer to their non detrital fillings and distinct \n\nforms, when compared with storage pits defined by \n\nBux\u00f3 (1997), whose sections are funnel-shaped. As \n\nso, their ceremonial or commemorative role can be \n\nquestionable. Denouncing evident links with funer-\n\nary practices, by their proximity to some plain \n\ngraves (nucleus 1), it is possible that they served as \n\ncontainers to hold depositions or offerings in per-\n\nishable materials. Such a situation is compatible, \n\nfor example, with the subcircular base formed by \n\nfour rocks which was identified thereabout the \n\nmiddle interior of pit 1. This stony arrangement \n\nmay have received a child\u2019s body, an ossuary, a \n\nreduction, etc. \n\nFinally, both South slope and the knoll were \n\ncircumscribed by a perimeter ditch. Its stratigraphy \n\nconfirms a simultaneous construction throughout \n\nthe different areas of the knoll, which carbon dat-\n\ning results situate on the regional Late Bronze Age.  \n\nThis circumscription may be interpreted as the \n\nconstruction of an \u201cenclosure\u201d that, at a certain \n\ntime, was circled by a palisade (SAMPAIO et al. \n\n2008).  However, its purposes seem to move away \n\nfrom the original funerary features attached to the \n\nsite. This may be explained by the alteration and/or \n\nrenovation of the significances and senses attrib-\n\nuted by the communities to this place, during its \n\nlong diachrony. \n\nLike other topics, the study of the Bronze \n\nAge funerary ambiences reflects the complexity of \n\nthe communities that once practiced them. Just as \n\ntoday, their dealing towards the inevitability of \n\ndeath assumed unique perceptions and understand-\n\nings about the phenomenon.  As such, each funer-\n\nary context revealed \u2013 more or less singular \u2013 may \n\nopen a new window to our interpretation about the \n\npast and how populations coped and acted with the \n\nloss of their loved ones. At the same time, it in-\n\ncreases our interpretative possibilities on the living \n\nones, in other words, on the lifestyles of the popu-\n\nlations that erected those sites for the dead and \n\nparticipated in the funerary ceremonies. \n\n \n\n \nAKNOLDGMENTS \n\n \n\nTo Foundation for Science and Technology, by the \n\nPh.D. grant conceded (reference SFRH / BD / 4177 / 2007), \n\nto the directive and technical team of D.
