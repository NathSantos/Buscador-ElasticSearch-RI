They can have natural origin (fires, volcanic eruptions, \n\namong others) or anthropogenic origin by the incomplete combustion of organic matter (coal, oil, wood). \n\nThis is not only an environmental problem but also impacts on public health, since studies that indicate \n\nthe toxicity and mutagenic/carcinogenic effects of PAHs are reported. \n\nMany attempts have been made to develop strategies to eliminate these compounds. Bioremediation \n\nhas emerged as a possible solution to the problem using microorganisms and taking advantage of their \n\ndegrading capacity to reduce or eliminate the presence of PAHs. The presence of PAHs on planet Earth \n\nthrough the evolution of life shaped the evolution of metabolic pathways allowing microorganisms to \n\nuse these compounds as carbon and energy sources.  \n\nA screening of forty-seven strains (Biotask Bioremediation Culture collection) from adaptive \n\nevolution experiments was performed. The initial inoculum of the experiments was from a wastewater \n\ntreatment plant. In order to evaluate the degradative potential of these strains, growth assays were \n\nperformed with naphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene as the only source of carbon and energy. \n\nDirectly, an HPLC method was developed and optimized that allowed the quantification of PAHs \n\npresent in the biological samples. Indirectly, a cell viability study was performed through the most \n\nprobable numbers. The most recent cycle of adaptive evolution revealed the best results as expected. \n\nThe selection of the best degraders was performed through a principal component analysis. In \n\naddition, an environmental contaminant revealed an interesting degradative behaviour and was included \n\nin the BBC collection. \n\nSequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, allowed the four strains to be presumptively identified \n\nas belonging to the genus Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and Paraburkholderia. \n\nCharacterization of the strains involved three phases. Initially, the growth of the microorganisms \n\nwas monitored having the PAHs as the carbon source for 15 days, both individually and in a consortium. \n\nThe strain belonging to the genus Pseudomonas present the best results and possibly a bi-phasic growth. \n\nThe consortium also revealed that strains together yield better results than individual growth. Then, the \n\nproduction of biosurfactants was evaluated qualitatively through the observation of an emulsion and \n\nquantitatively through the measurement of surface tension. The strain belonging to the genus \n\nAcinetobacter was the only one that apparently synthesizes a compound with surfactant activity. Finally, \n\nthe presence of genes associated with PAH catabolism and growth having the metabolic intermediate \n\nphthalate as the sole source of carbon was evaluated. The strains belonging to the genera Pseudomonas \n\nand Paraburkholderia were the ones that presented greater metabolic plasticity. \n\nIn summary, it can be concluded that the objective of the work was achieved, and the most \n\npromising strains with higher potential for degradation of PAHs were selected and studied in metabolic \n\nand genetic terms. The growth of the strains in the consortium was successfully achieved and some \n\ncharacteristics that may explain strains degradative behaviour were revealed. More studies will be \n\nneeded to elucidate more clearly the whole process in order to build an effective consortium for the \n\nbioremediation of contaminated sites. \n\nKey-Words: Bioremediation, Bioaugmentation, Metabolism, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons, \n\nConsortium \n\n\n\n \n\nV \n\n \n\nResumo \n \n\nOs hidrocarbonetos arom\u00e1ticos polic\u00edclicos (HAP) s\u00e3o poluentes ambientais encontrados na \n\n\u00e1gua, no solo e na atmosfera. Estes compostos s\u00e3o de elevada import\u00e2ncia devido ao perigo que \n\nrepresentam em termos de sa\u00fade humana e em termos ambientais, existindo uma lista de 16 HAP \n\nconsiderados poluentes priorit\u00e1rios, apresentando propriedades t\u00f3xicas, mutag\u00e9nicas e/ou \n\ncarcinog\u00e9nicas. \n\nPor um lado, podem ser gerados naturalmente atrav\u00e9s de fogos florestais, atividade vulc\u00e2nica e \n\nderramamentos de petr\u00f3leo. Por outro lado, podem ter origem em atividades antropog\u00e9nicas durante a \n\ncombust\u00e3o incompleta de materiais org\u00e2nicos, como o \u00f3leo, o petr\u00f3leo ou a madeira. O facto de serem \n\ninsol\u00faveis em \u00e1gua dificulta a sua remo\u00e7\u00e3o e consequentemente leva a que se tornem recalcitrantes no \n\nmeio ambiente, persistindo por muitos anos. \n\nV\u00e1rias tecnologias de remedia\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00eam sido testadas com o objetivo de remover estes \n\ncontaminantes ambientais. Muitas das abordagens t\u00eam uma natureza qu\u00edmica, o que al\u00e9m de se traduzir \n\nem elevados custos econ\u00f3micos tamb\u00e9m est\u00e1 associado \u00e0 gera\u00e7\u00e3o de subprodutos tamb\u00e9m de natureza \n\nt\u00f3xica. Recentemente, a biorremedia\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00eam sido alvo de aten\u00e7\u00e3o j\u00e1 que o uso de microrganismos para \n\nremo\u00e7\u00e3o de HAP tem sido vista como uma op\u00e7\u00e3o mais segura e com menos custos. V\u00e1rios g\u00e9neros de \n\nbact\u00e9rias Gram positivas e Gram negativas, bem como fungos e algas capazes de utilizar estes compostos \n\ncomo fonte de carbono e energia t\u00eam sido isolados e caraterizados. Na natureza, s\u00e3o raras as vezes que \n\nestes microrganismos com capacidade de degradar poluentes se encontram individualmente. \n\nGeralmente, existem em cons\u00f3rcio, ou seja, associa\u00e7\u00f5es naturais de v\u00e1rios microrganismos diferentes \n\nque interagem sinergicamente entre si, aumentando a efici\u00eancia de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o. Esta coopera\u00e7\u00e3o resulta \n\npor exemplo em intera\u00e7\u00f5es onde os produtos metab\u00f3licos de um microrganismo podem ser o substrato \n\npara outro microrganismo.  \n\nNas esta\u00e7\u00f5es de tratamento de \u00e1guas residuais, o objetivo \u00e9 obter um efluente que possa retornar \n\nao ciclo da \u00e1gua com o m\u00ednimo impacto no ambiente. Neste contexto ecol\u00f3gico, os microrganismos \n\ngeralmente realizam metabolismo aer\u00f3bio, tendo o oxig\u00e9nio como aceitador final de eletr\u00f5es. \n\nCatabolicamente, as enzimas com atividade de dioxigenase t\u00eam um papel fundamental na ativa\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\nHAP para degrada\u00e7\u00e3o. Um aspeto do metabolismo aer\u00f3bio \u00e9 a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de intermedi\u00e1rios metab\u00f3licos \n\ncomo o salicilato, o catecol, o gentisato e o ftalato que ap\u00f3s rea\u00e7\u00f5es enzim\u00e1ticas originaram metabolitos \n\nque comp\u00f5em o ciclo dos \u00e1cidos tricarbox\u00edlicos. Estas prote\u00ednas com atividade catal\u00edtica est\u00e3o \n\namplamente distribu\u00eddas por diferentes microrganismos, considerando-se mesmo a exist\u00eancia de \n\ndiferentes fam\u00edlias de enzimas associadas a determinados taxa microbianos. \n\n Al\u00e9m disso, verifica-se uma plasticidade metab\u00f3lica no que diz respeito \u00e0 degrada\u00e7\u00e3o destes \n\ncompostos podendo ocorrer tamb\u00e9m degrada\u00e7\u00e3o em condi\u00e7\u00f5es de anaerobiose, tendo compostos \n\ninorg\u00e2nicos como o sulfato, o nitrato e o ferro como aceitadores de eletr\u00f5es. No entanto, ainda existe \n\nmuito por revelar sobre este metabolismo. \n\nO presente trabalho tem como objetivo a sele\u00e7\u00e3o e caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o metab\u00f3lica e gen\u00e9tica das \n\nmelhores estirpes degradadoras presentes na cole\u00e7\u00e3o Biotask Bioremediation Culture, com vista \u00e0 \n\nconstru\u00e7\u00e3o de um cons\u00f3rcio para degrada\u00e7\u00e3o de HAPs, nomeadamente naftaleno, antraceno e \n\nfenantreno. \n\nQuarenta e sete estirpes microbianas provenientes de quatro experi\u00eancias de evolu\u00e7\u00e3o adaptativa \n\ne de v\u00e1rios ciclos dessas mesmas experi\u00eancias tendo antraceno, fenantreno, \u00f3leo mineral e tristearina \n\n\n\n \n\nVI \n\n \n\ncomo \u00fanica fonte de carbono e energia foram estudados. O in\u00f3culo inicial das experi\u00eancias de evolu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nadaptativa foi proveniente de uma esta\u00e7\u00e3o de tratamento de \u00e1guas residuais. \n\nAp\u00f3s sete dias de crescimento das quarenta e sete estirpes tendo naftaleno, antraceno e \n\nfenantreno como \u00fanica fonte de carbono e energia, foi realizada uma triagem das quarenta e sete estirpes \n\natrav\u00e9s de uma avalia\u00e7\u00e3o direta e uma avalia\u00e7\u00e3o indireta da efici\u00eancia de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o. Diretamente, foi \n\ndesenvolvido e otimizado um m\u00e9todo de quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o por cromatografia l\u00edquida de elevada \n\nperformance. Atrav\u00e9s da constru\u00e7\u00e3o das curvas de calibra\u00e7\u00e3o para naftaleno, antraceno e fenantreno foi \n\nposs\u00edvel dosear a quantidade desses poluentes presentes em amostras biol\u00f3gicas provenientes do \n\ncrescimento. Indiretamente, foram realizados ensaios que permitiram concluir sobre a viabilidade \n\ncelular atrav\u00e9s do m\u00e9todo dos n\u00fameros mais prov\u00e1veis dos microrganismos em estudo ap\u00f3s os sete dias \n\nde crescimento. Desta triagem inicial, foi poss\u00edvel concluir que os melhores resultados foram obtidos \n\npara as estirpes provenientes do ciclo de evolu\u00e7\u00e3o adaptativa mais recente, ou seja, foi corroborado o \n\nsucesso das experi\u00eancias de evolu\u00e7\u00e3o adaptativa. Surgiram tamb\u00e9m evid\u00eancias da volatilidade e da \n\ntoxicidade do naftaleno ser um fator que justifica a sua baixa concentra\u00e7\u00e3o quantificada \n\ncromatograficamente e a baixa viabilidade dos microrganismos na presen\u00e7a deste HAP. \n\nCom vista a selecionar as estirpes com maior potencial degradativo foi realizada uma an\u00e1lise \n\nmultivariada que integra os dados quantitativos da cromatografia l\u00edquida de elevada performance e os \n\ndados de viabilidade celular resultantes dos n\u00fameros mais prov\u00e1veis. A an\u00e1lise em componentes \n\nprincipais permitiu escolher as estirpes que melhor se posicionavam no espa\u00e7o formado pelas novas \n\nvari\u00e1veis \u2013 componentes principais. Tamb\u00e9m esta an\u00e1lise permitiu observar que as estirpes pertencentes \n\naos ciclos de evolu\u00e7\u00e3o adaptativa mais recentes e que se esperam exibirem um melhor comportamento \n\ndegradativo estavam localizadas na zona do gr\u00e1fico onde seria expect\u00e1vel encontrar os melhores \n\ndegradadores.  \n\nAl\u00e9m das tr\u00eas estirpes selecionadas pela an\u00e1lise de componentes principais, num ensaio de \n\ncrescimento surgiu um novo microrganismo como contaminante ambiental que foi adicionado \u00e0 cole\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nj\u00e1 que exibia um comportamento degradativo em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos HAPs e dada a dificuldade em encontrar \n\nao acaso microrganismos com essas carater\u00edsticas (geralmente s\u00e3o isolados em locais j\u00e1 contaminados \n\npelos poluentes), pensou-se ser interessante explor\u00e1-lo melhor e inclu\u00ed-lo nos estudos futuros. \n\nEm seguida, os quatro microrganismos selecionados foram identificados presuntivamente \n\natrav\u00e9s de sequencia\u00e7\u00e3o do gene bacteriano que codifica para o RNA ribossomal 16S como pertencentes \n\naos g\u00e9neros Pseudomonas (dois microrganismos), Acinetobacter e Paraburkholderia. \n\nCom o prop\u00f3sito de investigar o metabolismo degradativo dos HAPs por parte destas bact\u00e9rias, \n\nforam realizados estudos de carateriza\u00e7\u00e3o metab\u00f3lica e gen\u00e9tica.  \n\nEm primeiro lugar, foi monitorizado durante quinze dias o crescimento destes microrganismos \n\ntendo naftaleno, antraceno ou fenantreno como \u00fanica fonte de carbono e energia. As estirpes foram \n\nestudadas isoladamente e em conjunto, constituindo um cons\u00f3rcio bacteriano. Observou-se \n\naparentemente um crescimento bif\u00e1sico e a estirpe pertencente ao g\u00e9nero Pseudomonas destacou-se, \n\napresentando o melhor comportamento degradativo. O cons\u00f3rcio tamb\u00e9m revelou que as estirpes em \n\nconjunto apresentam resultados superiores do que se estiverem a crescer individualmente. \n\nEm segundo lugar, foi avaliada a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de biosurfactantes como estrat\u00e9gia de solubiliza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndestes compostos poluentes. Ap\u00f3s uma pr\u00e9-sele\u00e7\u00e3o com um teste qualitativo onde se observou a \n\nforma\u00e7\u00e3o de uma emuls\u00e3o est\u00e1vel em duas estirpes, foi realizado um ensaio quantitativo atrav\u00e9s da \n\nmedi\u00e7\u00e3o da tens\u00e3o superficial. Foi poss\u00edvel concluir que a estirpe pertence ao g\u00e9nero Acinetobacter \n\naparentemente sintetiza algum composto com atividade surfactante. \n\n\n\n \n\nVII \n\n \n\nEm terceiro lugar, foi realizada uma pesquisa de genes que est\u00e3o reportados como associados \n\nao catabolismo dos PAHs atrav\u00e9s de polimerase chain reaction (PCR), tendo como alvo enzimas chave \n\npara o clivagem de intermedi\u00e1rios metab\u00f3licos. Al\u00e9m disso, foi tamb\u00e9m monitorizado o crescimento \n\ntendo ftalato como \u00fanica fonte de carbono e energia. Foi encontrada evid\u00eancia que a estirpe pertencente \n\nao g\u00e9nero Acinetobacter possui genes que lhe permitem optar por um metabolismo aer\u00f3bio com \n\nclivagem orto do metabolito intermedi\u00e1rio catecol. Quanto \u00e0s estirpes pertences ao g\u00e9nero Pseudomonas \n\ne ao g\u00e9nero Paraburkholderia foi observada a presen\u00e7a de genes que lhe permitem seguir a via de \n\ndegrada\u00e7\u00e3o meta do catecol e ainda a via do gentisato. Em adi\u00e7\u00e3o, a estirpe pertencente ao g\u00e9nero \n\nParaburkolderia revelou ser a \u00fanica que claramente \u00e9 capaz de crescer tendo ftalato como \u00fanica fonte \n\nde carbono, o que indica que pode tamb\u00e9m seguir esta via degradativa. Relativamente ao outro \n\nmicrorganismo pertencente tamb\u00e9m ao g\u00e9nero Pseudomonas n\u00e3o foi detetada nenhuma amplifica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nnem crescimento em ftalato. \n\nEm suma, pode concluir-se que o objetivo do trabalho foi atingido, tendo sido selecionadas e \n\nestudadas em termos metab\u00f3licos e gen\u00e9ticos as estirpes mais promissoras em termos de potencial de \n\ndegrada\u00e7\u00e3o de HAPs. Foi verificado o sucesso do crescimento das estirpes no cons\u00f3rcio e relevadas \n\nalgumas caracter\u00edsticas que podem explicar o seu comportamento degradativo. Mais estudos ser\u00e3o \n\nnecess\u00e1rios para elucidar mais claramente quais as vias metab\u00f3licas do catabolismo destes compostos e \n\nconsequentemente ter acesso ao m\u00e1ximo do seu potencial de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o, com vista \u00e0 constru\u00e7\u00e3o de um \n\ncons\u00f3rcio eficaz para a biorremedia\u00e7\u00e3o de locais contaminados. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPalavras-Chave: Bioremedia\u00e7\u00e3o, Bioaumenta\u00e7\u00e3o, Metabolismo, Hidrocarbonetos Arom\u00e1ticos \n\nPolic\u00edclicos, Cons\u00f3rcio \n\n\n\n \n\nVIII \n\n \n\nIndex \n\nAcknowledgments ...............................................................................................................................

Structurally, they have a core formed by two or more fused benzene rings with a linear, \n\nangular or clustered geometry and a pair of carbon atoms shared between these aromatic rings (Parab \n\nand Phadke, 2017). These compounds are categorized as low-molecular weight if they comprise up to \n\nthree fused aromatic rings or high-molecular weight if containing more than three aromatic rings (Cravo-\n\nLaureau, 2017). \n\n PAHs are considered ubiquitous since they can be found in water, soil and atmosphere, being \n\nenvironmentally persistent with numerous different structures and varied toxicity. These compounds are \n\npresent in priority pollution list of European Union (EU), EU Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) and \n\nthe United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) because they are considered \n\nenvironmental pollutants which cause deleterious effects on flora and fauna of contaminated sites \n\n(USEPA, 2008). In addition, PAHs can cause health problems and genetic defects in human beings, \n\nhaving been reported mutagenic and carcinogenic effects (Armstrong et al., 2004). The mechanism of \n\ntoxicity is related to interferences with cellular membrane function as well as with enzyme machinery \n\n(Abdel-Shafy and Mansour, 2016). \n\n PAHs can be formed naturally through biological processes of natural petroleum formation as \n\nproducts of incomplete combustion from natural combustion sources such as forest fires or volcanic \n\neruptions. However, the major source is anthropogenic with incomplete combustion in incinerators and \n\nindustrial processes being a large point source. Other anthropogenic sources are automotive emissions, \n\ncigar smoke, barbecues, petroleum product spills and sewage sludge, among others (Abdel-Shafy and \n\nMansour, 2016). \n\n \n\n1.1 Bioremediation \n\n \n\nPAHs are difficult to remove from nature. Until recently, to eliminate these pollutants \n\nphysicochemical treatments (steam distillation, solidification, chemical precipitation and incineration) \n\nhave been implemented. However, besides being more expensive and generate toxic sub products that \n\nrequire additional treatment, the methods described tend to transport contaminant compounds from one \n\nplace to another rather than really eliminate them (Blanco-Enr\u00edquez et al., 2018). \n\n Bioremediation is an approach to convert the toxic compounds to less hazardous/non-hazardous \n\nforms with less input of chemicals, energy and time. This is a process to remove pollutants in an eco-\n\nfriendly manner and have low cost operation costs. PAH-contaminated sites can be remediated via \n\nindividual microorganisms \u2013 algae, bacteria and fungi - or in combination \u2013 microbial consortia (Waigi \n\net al., 2015). Bacterial genera that are known to degrade PAHs are present in Appendix A (Seo et al., \n\n2009). Employing microbial consortia leads to large-scale production since pure cultures are not often \n\neconomically practicable due to high production costs, substrates and biomass recovery. In addition, \n\nmicroorganisms are rarely isolated as pure cultures but are naturally part of consortia in contaminated \n\nsites (Blanco-Enr\u00edquez et al., 2018). \n\n In wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), the biodegradation of pollutants by taking advantage \n\nof microorganisms present in activated sludge is one of the most important strategies to remove organic \n\n\n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\ncontaminants from wastewater. Nevertheless, this approach has limitations since many contaminants are \n\nnot efficiently eliminated. To counterweight the limitations, the concept of bioaugmentation has \n\nemerged by the introduction of specific and efficient pollutant-degrading microorganisms (natural or \n\ngenetically engineered) into a microbial community to enhance their hydrocarbon-oxidizing potential \n\n(Nzila et al., 2016).  \n\n \n\n1.2 Bacterial metabolism of PAHs  \n \n\n  A wide variety of bacterial, fungal and algal species have the potential to degrade PAHs. \n\nHowever, this introduction will only focus on the bacterial metabolism of PAHs degradation. \n\n1.2.1 Aerobic degradation  \n\n The initial step in the metabolic aerobic degradation process of PAHs involve their chemo-, \n\nregio- and stereospecific hydroxylation by dioxygenases, which catalyse the incorporation of two \n\noxygen atoms from molecular oxygen into the aromatic ring. From this reaction, cis-dihydrodiols are \n\nformed and targeted by dehydrogenases to form a limited number of central aromatic acid intermediates, \n\nsuch as the monoaromatic compounds o-phthalate, salicylate and gentisate. The aromatic ring of the \n\noxyfunctionalized metabolites produced is then cleaved at the ortho or meta position by ring cleaving \n\ndioxygenases such as C-C breaking oxygenases, yielding intermediates which can enter in central \n\nmetabolic routes for example the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) or the ?-oxidation cycle (Ghosal et al., \n\n2016) (Bruno and Schmid, 2004). \n\n The degradation scheme described (Figure 1) is called \u201cmetabolic funnel\u201d because it suggests \n\nthat microorganisms increased the range of substrates by developing highly diverse upper pathways \n\nincluding enzymes with large substrate spectra able to turn a variety of initial substrates into one of the \n\ncentral metabolites. The oxygenases involved in the metabolism of PAHs belong to different families \n\nof enzymes and are distinguished by the type of reaction they catalyse, in particular the range of \n\nsubstrates they can transform (Ghosal et al., 2016). The location and geometry of the active site are \n\ncritical in enzyme specificity because they influence substrate access and orientation. Depending on this \n\nselectivity, different dihydrodiols are formed, which determines the subsequent steps of the degradation \n\npathway (Ferraro et al., 2006). Consequently, this variability contribute to the flexibility of the microbial \n\nmachinery for degrading PAHs (Bruno and Schmid, 2004). \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 Representative scheme of the main upper and lower aerobic degradation pathways of PAHs under study. \n\nDashed lines indicate the omission of intermediate enzymatic steps (information adapted from KEGG Pathway \n\nDatabase). \n\n \n \n\nUpper \n\nLower \n\nPyruvate Fumarate \n\nPyruvate \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\nThe Rieske non-heme iron dioxygenase called ring hidroxylating dioxygenase (RHD) (Bugg \n\nand Ramaswamy, 2008) is the essential enzyme for initiating PAH catabolism by ring hydroxylation. It \n\nconsists of a nicotinamide adenine nucleotide (NADH) reductase, a ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] and a terminal \n\noxygenase. This last component is formed by a larger ?-subunit with the iron-sulfur proteins (ISP), with \n\nFe (II) as cofactor in the active centre of the enzyme which confers the designation of extradiol \n\ndioxygenase (Lipscomb, 2009) and a smaller ?-subunit with structural functions. The reductase and \n\nferredoxin transport electrons to the ?-subunit, which inserts molecular oxygen into the substrate to give \n\ncis-dihydrodiols, which are subsequently transformed to diols by a dehydrogenase (Cravo-Laureau, \n\n2017) (Figure 2). \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPAH-RDHs are largely distributed enzymes across microbial taxa and comparisons of \n\nsimilarities in amino acid sequence have revealed distinct PAH-RDH families, the phylogenies of which \n\ngenerally follow those of the host (see Appendix B). Proteobacterial RDH are generally most active with \n\nlow molecular weight PAHs such as naphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene than actinobacterial \n\nRDH (Cravo-Laureau, 2017). The variability in gene clusters and the promiscuity of the enzymes \n\ninvolved in PAHs catabolism provide microorganisms with the capacity to degrade a great range of \n\ncompounds. \n\n \n\n \n1.2.2 Anaerobic degradation  \n\nIn the absence of oxygen, it is known that naphthalene and two-ring PAHs can be used as the \n\nsole carbon source of carbon and energy. Whether three or more ring PAHs are used as growth substrate \n\nor co-metabolized in anaerobic condition remains unclear (Meckenstock et al., 2004). \n\nIt was reported the success of sulfate-reducing naphthalene-degrading cultures from different \n\nPAHs contaminated anoxic aquifers, pointing that the capacity to degrade naphthalene anaerobically \n\nwith sulfate as terminal electron acceptor is widespread in nature (K\u00fcmmel et al., 2015). Other studies \n\nindicate that anaerobic PAH-degradation can also be performed by iron-reducing microorganisms \n\n(Kleemann and Meckenstock, 2011). There were also reports on degradation of PAHs with nitrate as \n\nelectron acceptor but it has been difficult to reproduced them (Eriksson et al., 2003). \n\n \n\nFigure 2 Initial oxidation of naphthalene to cis-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalenediol by naphthalene \n\ndioxygenase (extracted from Habe and Omori, 2003). \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n1.3 Microbial uptake of PAHs \n \n\nThe bioavailability of the pollutants is influenced by polarity, hydrophobicity and water \n\nsolubility. As PAHs are hydrophobic and practically insoluble in water and present high octanol-water \n\npartition coefficient they remain adsorbed in the non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL). Besides that, PAHs \n\nstrongly bind to soil and sediment organic matter. However, since the degradative enzymes essential for \n\nthe metabolism of PAHs have an intracellular location, they must be solubilized so that they can enter \n\nthe cytoplasm and be metabolized. Two strategies can be implemented to enable the access of \n\nmicroorganisms to the compounds and consequently their biodegradation: either the target compound is \n\ndissolved in the aqueous phase or the microorganism adheres directly to the NAPL (Schluep et al., \n\n2001).. \n\nPAH\u2019s properties limit their bioavailability and thus the effectiveness of a bioremediation \n\nprocess. Driven by the solubilization capacity of surfactants - synthetic and natural - for hydrophobic \n\ncompounds, surfactant-mediated remediation has been a research focus in recent years (Makkar and \n\nRockne, 2003; Li and Chen, 2009)  \n\nA surfactant is an amphiphilic molecule composed of a hydrophilic group and a hydrophobic \n\ngroup that can accumulate at the liquid-liquid interfaces and reduce both surface tension and interfacial \n\ntension. In addition, surfactants increase the solubility, mobility, bioavailability and subsequent \n\nbiodegradation of hydrophobic or insoluble organic compounds, such as PAHs. When the surfactant \n\nconcentration exceeds a certain level, called critical micellar concentration (CMC), the molecules \n\naggregate and micelles are formed. In this condition, hydrophobic molecules, depending on their \n\npolarity, are incorporated into the micelle core or the micelle/water interface, and their solubilization \n\noccurs (Li and Chen, 2009).  \n\nSurfactants can enhance bioremediation in three ways (Figure 3). First, the microorganism can \n\ntake up the pollutant from the direct interaction of the micelle with cell membrane. Second, \n\nmicroorganisms use only the pollutant molecules that are dissolved in the aqueous phase and the role of \n\nthe surfactant is thereby to increase the mass transfer from NAPL to aqueous phase. Third, the presence \n\nof surfactants changes cell hydrophobicity, facilitating the direct contact with cells (Schippers et al., \n\n2000). \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3 Explanatory approaches for the surfactant mediated incorporation of pollutants (extracted from Schippers \n\net al., 2000). \n\n. \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\nPossibly, a more promising answer for bioavailability enhancement may be the use of \n\nsurfactants produced naturally by microorganisms \u2013 biosurfactants - whose primary function is to \n\nfacilitate microbial life in hydrophilic-hydrophobic environments.  Over the last years, interest in \n\nbiosurfactants increased due to their several advantages over their synthetic counterparts. For example, \n\nbiosurfactants are easily biodegradable and consequently pose no extra pollution threat. In addition, \n\nmost studies indicate that they are not toxic to microorganisms and therefore not likely to inhibit \n\nbiodegradation of PAHs. Biosurfactant production is also potentially more cost-effective than synthetic \n\nsurfactants and can be easily achieved in situ at contaminated sites using inexpensive raw materials. In \n\ncontrast, synthetic surfactants can be toxic, be degraded instead of the pollutant and their production is \n\nexpensive since they derived only from synthetic stocks, which make the remediation difficult to achieve \n\non site (Makkar and Rockne, 2003). \n\nBiosurfactants can be classified based on their compound structure as glycolipids, lipopeptides \n\nand lipoprotein, fatty acids, phospholipids and neutral lipids, polymeric surfactants and particulate \n\nbiosurfactant (Shekhar et al., 2015). Detailed information about the microorganism and associated \n\nbiosurfactant are present in Appendix C. \n\nSince PAHs exhibit low solubility in water and a high octanol-water partition coefficient, they \n\ntend to partition in cell wall structures generally through passive transport driven by the concentration \n\ngradient between the environment and the cell.  The bilayer of phospholipids that constitutes bacterial \n\nmembranes creates a hydrophobic region in the interior of the membrane that can act as a reservoir for \n\naccumulation of hydrophobic compounds (Bugg et al., 2000). Thus, both the concentration of the \n\npollutant and its bioavailability are crucial for the transport process. The higher the concentration and \n\nbioavailability of PAHs, the greater is their transport to the cell, always considering the saturation limit \n\nof the transporters. On one side, microorganisms can use this passive diffusion to reach rapid \n\ndegradation of PAHs, with consequent growth. On the other side, the rapid accumulation of PAHs may \n\nlead to cell membrane disruption or inhibition of the membrane proteins etc., causing cell \n\ndeath.(Sikkema et al., 1995) When PAHs concentration and bioavailability is low, the transport may not \n\noccur, decreasing the efficiency of microbial degradation and therefore the bioremediation process. \n\nHowever, some microorganisms seem to have adapted to that conditions and exhibit mechanisms such \n\nas direct contact with solid-phase PAHs and biosurfactant excretion to facilitate desorption and \n\nsolubilization (as referred earlier) (Schluep et al., 2001).  \n\nSome studies have shown the presence of an active efflux mechanism of phenanthrene, \n\nfluoranthene and anthracene in Pseudomonas fluorescens LP6a (Bugg et al., 2000). It has also been \n\nproposed the involvement of a specific energy-dependent carrier for the incorporation of naphthalene \n\ninto Pseudomonas fluorescens Uper-1 (Whitman, 1998). In Mycobacterium sp. strain RJGII-135 was \n\nsuggested the existence of passive and active transport for the use of phenanthrene (Miyata et al., 2004). \n\nAlthough limited research has been performed on cellular binding and transport of PAHs, several \n\nexperiments suggest that passive and active transport systems can be exploited to increase the efficiency \n\nof bioremediation.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n1.4 Genes associated with catabolism of PAHs \n \n\nnah-like genes  \n Genetically, naphthalene catabolism has been extensively studied using the Pseudomonas \n\nputida G7 strain as a model, since a transmissible metabolic plasmid that carries genetic information \n\nenabling its host to use naphthalene as a sole source of carbon and energy was isolated (Early, 1973). In \n\nNAH7 plasmid, naphthalene oxidation genes are organized in two operons: the upper catabolic pathway \n\noperon includes genes nahABCDEF encoding the enzymes involved in the conversion of naphthalene \n\nto salicylate and the lower catabolic pathway operon includes genes nahGHIJK, coding the enzymes \n\ninvolved in the salicylate to TCA cycle intermediates pyruvate and acetaldehyde via catechol meta-\n\ncleavage pathway. It is implied that the enzymes required for the catechol ortho cleavage pathway \n\noriginating the TCA cycle intermediates succinyl CoA and acetyl CoA are encoded in genes located on \n\nthe chromosome (Yent and Gunsalus, 1985). Both upper (nah) and lower (sal) catabolic pathway \n\noperons are regulated by a trans-acting positive control regulator coded by the nahR gene, located \n\nbetween the two operons (Schell, 1985). The nahR gene encodes a LysR-type transcriptional repressor-\n\nactivator that binds to promoters upstream of both the upper and lower catabolic pathway operons and \n\nrepresses transcription allowing only a basal level of expression. Binding of salicylate to NahR at the \n\npromoters induces a conformational change in DNA-bound NahR that enables transcription to occur \n\n(Cravo-Laureau, 2017). This regulatory protein is needed for the high-level expression of the nah genes \n\n(Habe and Omori, 2003). \n\n Nucleotide sequences of genes encoding naphthalene upper-catabolic enzymes from several \n\nPseudomonas spp. strains were described. These genes were named according to the strains\u2019s feature of \n\nsubstrate use: nah for naphthalene degradation from P. putida strain G7 and P. stutzeri strain AN10 \n\n(Simon et al., 1993; Moore, Bosch and Garc?, 1999), ndo for naphthalene dioxygenation from P. putida \n\nstrain NCIB9816 (Palva and Teeri, 1988) (equivalent to nah), dox for dibenzothiophene oxidation from \n\nPseudomonas sp. strain C18 (Denome et al., 1993), and pah for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon \n\n(phenanthrene) degradation from P. putida strain OUS82 and P. aeruginosa strain PaK1 (Wang and \n\nRoad, 1999) (later, all of these strains were found to grow on naphthalene). The gene organization and \n\nsequence similarity (about 90%) among the upper catabolic pathways genes of these strains were similar \n\nto those of the nah genes from the NAH7 plasmid of strain G7. Consequently, these genes are called \n\n\u201cclassical nah-like genes\u201d. In the upper catabolic pathway, the genes coding for NDO ferredoxin \n\nreductase (nahAa), NDO ferredoxin (nahAb), the a subunit of NDO (nahAc), the b subunit of NDO \n\n(nahAd), naphthalene cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (nahB), salicylaldehyde dehydrogenase (nahF), \n\n1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase (nahC), an unknown ORF (nahQ), trans-\n\nohydroxybenzylidenepyruvate hydratase-aldolase (nahE), and 2-hydroxychromene-2-carboxylate \n\nisomerase (nahD), are arranged in this order (nahAaAbAcAdBFCQED) (Habe and Omori, 2003). \n\n For the lower catabolic pathway, the reported genes are present on Pseudomonas stutzeri strain \n\nAN10 and encode the salicylate hydroxylase (nahG), chloroplast ferredoxin-like protein (nahT), \n\ncatechol 2,3-dioxygenase (nahH), hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (nahI), \n\nhydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase (nahN ), 2-oxopent-4-enoate hydratase (nahL), acetaldehyde \n\ndehydrogenase (nahO), 2-oxo-4-hydroxypentanoate aldolase (nahM), 4-oxalocrotonate decarboxylase \n\n(nahK ), and 4-oxalocrotonate isomerase (nahJ), being arranged in this order (nahGTHINLOMKJ ) \n\n(Moore et al.,  2000). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\nphd genes  \n Comamonas teststeroni strains (GZ38A, GZ39 and GZ42) were isolated from river sediment \n\nand exhibited the ability to grow on naphthalene as well as phenanthrene except for strain GZ38A which \n\ngrows on phenanthrene and anthracene. The catabolic genes present on the three strains had no genetic \n\nrelatedness to the nah-like genes from P. putida strain NCIB 9816-4 discussed above (Zylstra, 1996). \n\nIn strain GZ39, the genes responsible for the initial conversion of naphthalene and phenanthrene were \n\nnamed phd genes. The results indicated that the genes for phenanthrene degradation in strain GZ38A \n\nare similar (but not identical) to those from strain GZ39, but that strain GZ42 did not have any genes \n\nsimilar to the phd genes from strain GZ39. This make evident that these C. testosteroni strains represent \n\nat least two new classes of genes involved in PAH degradation. It also indicates that at least three non-\n\nhomologous families of genes responsible for phenanthrene degradation can be found in the same \n\nenvironmental sample (Zylstra, 1996; Zylstra, 1997) \n\n In strain GZ39, the genes coding for ferredoxin (phdAb), ferredoxin reductase (phdAa), cis-\n\ndihydrodiol dehydrogenase (phdB), the ? subunit of ISP (phdAc), the b subunit of ISP (phdAd), \n\nisomerase (phdD), an unknown ORF, glutathione-S-transferase, and hydratase-aldolase (phdE) were \n\narranged in this order (phdAbAaBAcAdDE). This gene organization was relatively diferent from that of \n\nthe nah-like genes, and several genes such as extradiol dioxygenase (nahC analogue) were not within \n\nthe cluster (Zylstra, 1997) The phd genes were compared to genes known from PAH catabolism and the \n\n? subunit sequence of ISP (PhdAc) was found to fit within the naphthalene family of dioxygenases \n\nalthough they are not closely related. In contrast, the sequences of the ? subunit  of ISP (PhdAd) and \n\nferredoxin (PhdAb) showed little similarity to proteins having the same function in other aromatic ring \n\ndioxygenases (Habe and Omori, 2003). \n\n It is important to mention that although strain GZ42 has novel genes for phenanthrene \n\ndegradation, they are divergent relatives of those found in P. putida NCIB 9816. However, the \n\nnucleotide structure of the genes reveals some very important differences between the two strains. For \n\nexample, the amino acid sequences of the enzymes are much closely related than the nucleotide sequence \n\nof each analogous gene, revealing genetic drift with conservation of enzyme structure. More significant \n\nis the evidence that, although the gene order in strain GZ42 is identical to P. putida NCIB 9816, there \n\nare two new genes between the genes encoding ferredoxin reductase (nahAa) and ferredoxin (nahAb). \n\nThese genes were designated nahAc2 and nahAd2 because they were very similar to those of the ? and \n\n? subunits, respectively, of another aromatic-ring dioxygenases ISP (Zylstra, 1997). But these genes \n\nhave been thought to be non-functional in strain GZ42 (Habe and Omori, 2003). \n\n \n\nnag genes  \nA naphthalene catabolic operon with the same gene organization and similarity to the nah \n\noperon of the C. testeroni strain GZ42 was found in Ralstonia sp. strain U2 and characterized. The \n\nnaphthalene dioxygenase genes (nag genes) coding for ferredoxin reductase (nagAa), ferredoxin \n\n(nagAb), the a subunit of ISP (nagAc), the b subunit of ISP (nagAd), cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase \n\n(nagB), and aldehyde dehydrogenase (nagF ) were arranged in this order and two open reading frames \n\nnamed nagG and nagH (analogous to nahAc2 and nahAd2 of strain GZ42) were inserted between nagAa \n\nand nagAb. The nagG product aligns with the ? subunit of other aromatic-ring dioxygenases, but the \n\nnagH product exhibited  limited homology with the ? subunit of other aromatic-ring dioxygenases. It \n\nwas suggested that the hydroxylation of salicylate occurs through NagGH acting as a monooxygenase, \n\nwith an associated electron transport chain composed by a ferredoxin and a ferredoxin redutase \n\nproviding the electrons from a reduced nicotinamide cofactor, like NAD or NADP. This electron \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\ntransport chain for salicylate 5-hydroxylase is probably formed by NagAa and NagAb given the \n\nproximity between the genes coding for these proteins (nagAa and nagAb) and the nagG and nagH genes \n\n(Fuenmayor et al., 1998). The genes for conversion of naphthalene to gentisate \n\n(nagAaGHAbAcAdBFCQED) are ordered in the same way as the genes in the classic nah-like operon \n\nof Pseudomonas spp. strains, with the exeption of the nagGH insertion. Furthermore, there is another \n\ndifference between the nag operon and nah operon which is related to the regulatory gene nagR being \n\nlocated upstream the genes of upper catabolic pathway whereas its analogue nahR is located downstream \n\n(Zhou et al., 2001). \n\n \n\n Another gene cluster (nagJIKLMN) was found and the nagI, nagK, and nagL genes encoded the \n\nenzymes involved in the further catabolism of gentisate to fumarate-pyruvate: gentisate 1,2-\n\ndioxygenase, fumarylpyruvate hydrolase, and maleylpyruvate isomerase, respectively (Zhou et al., \n\n2001). \n\n Nucleotide sequence comparisons suggest that the novel gene order nagAa-nagG-nagH-nagAb-\n\nnagAc-nagAd-nagB-nagF represents the model for naphthalene strains (like U2 and GZ42) that \n\nmetabolize salicylate through the gentisate pathway instead of the catechol meta cleavage pathway \n\n(Fuenmayor et al., 1998). \n\n \n\nphn genes  \n A divergent set of PAH catabolic genes named phn genes were described and these genes can \n\nbe divided in two families, who are significantly different in sequence and gene order from the other \n\nclassic genes involved in PAH degradation. For example, phn-like genes, although isofunctional, have \n\nlittle homology with the nah-like genes (Laurie and Zealand, 1999). The PhnAcAFK2 family was first \n\nidentified in Alcaligenes faecalis AFK2 and the Phn term is used to indicate that microorganisms with \n\nthis genotype are characteristically limited to phenanthrene as sole carbon and energy source to support \n\ngrowth. The ring hydroxylating dioxygenase encoded in these genes leads to the formation of phthalate \n\nas an central intermediate. Although the name bears some resemblance, the PhnAcRP007 genotype \n\nidentified in Burkholderia sp. strain RP007 differs from the PhnAcAFK2 family because it allows the \n\nutilization of naphthalene and phenanthrene to support growth and it leads to the production of salicylate \n\nfrom the upper pathway rather than phthalate (Cravo-Laureau, 2017). \n\n Regarding Alcaligenes faecalis strain AFK2, the phn genes have a novel operon structure, and \n\nthe genes coding for ferredoxin (phnAb), ferredoxin reductase (phnAa), cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase \n\n(phnB), the ? subunit of NDO (phnAc), the ? subunit of NDO (phnAd), putative 2-hydroxychromene-2-\n\ncarboxylate isomerase (phnD), glutathione-S-transferase (gst), trans-2-carboxybenzalpyruvate \n\nhydratase-aldolase (phnH), 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate dioxygenase (phnG),2-carboxybenzaldehyde \n\ndehydrogenase (phnI), 3,4-dihydroxyphenanthrene dioxygenase (phnC)), 1-hydroxy-2-\n\nnaphthoaldehyde dehydrogenase (phnF), and putative transo-hydroxy  benzylidenepyruvate hydratase-\n\naldolase (phnE) are arranged in this order (phnAbAaBAcAdDHGICFE) (Kiyohara et al., 1982) \n\n \n\n  Also, Burkholderia sp. strain RP007 presents a phn operon distinct from those reported so far. \n\nThe naphthalene and phenanthrene can be degraded through a common upper pathway via salicylate \n\n(Habe and Omori, 2003). pathway These phn genes encode regulatory proteins (phnR and phnS), \n\naldehyde dehydrogenase (phnF), hydratase-aldolase (phnE), extradiol dioxygenase (phnC), isomerase \n\n(phnD), ISP ? subunit of initial dioxygenase (phnAc), ISP ? subunit of initial dioxygenase (phnAd), \n\ndihydrodiol dehydrogenase (phnB), arranged in this order (phnRSFECDAcAdB). Some particularities \n\nare noted, such as the fact that the locus has ISP ? and ? subunits of PAH-initial dioxygenase (phnAcAd) \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nbut lacks both the ferredoxin and reductase components.  In addition, the phnB gene encoding cis-diol \n\ndehydrogenase is more closely related to the corresponding genes from biphenyl catabolic pathways \n\nthan to those found in the classical nahB-like genes. Furthermore, phnC gene encodes a novel extradiol \n\ndioxygenase with phylogenetic relationships with known PAH and biphenyl dioxygenases (Laurie and \n\nZealand, 1999). Also two catechol 2,3-dioxygenase genes involved in the lower pathways (meta-\n\ncleavage yielding acethaldeyde and piruvate) were characterized (Laurie and Lloyd-jones, 1999).  \n\nUpstream of the phn catabolic genes, there are two putative regulatory genes, phnR and phnS, being \n\nPhnS a LysR-type transcriptional activator and PhnR is a member of the s54-dependent family of \n\npositive transcriptional regulators (Laurie and Zealand, 1999). \n\n \n\nbph genes  \n  Sphingomonads (composed of Sphingomonas, Sphingobium, Sphingopyxis and \n\nNovosphingobium genera) are capable of degrading PAHs like naphthalene, phenanthrene and \n\nanthracene by complete mineralization via similar pathways and enzymes found in other Gram-negative \n\nbacteria (Waigi et al., 2015). It was identified and characterized the complete sequence of a catabolic \n\nplasmid named pNL1 from Novosphingobium aromaticivorans strain F199 (Romine et al., 1999). This \n\nnucleotide sequence revealed a complex arrangement of genes for catabolism of all PAHs that are \n\nmetabolized by the strain, wherein at least 13 gene clusters were predicted to encode enzymes associated \n\nwith degradation of these compounds. Genes associated with degradation of naphthalene and byphenyl \n\nto catechol are predicted to take place in at least six different gene clusters. Seven different three-\n\ncomponent oxygenases are expected from sequence analysis and seemed to interact with only one set of \n\nferredoxin and reductase components in pNL1, acting as the only electron transport system for multiple \n\ndioxygenases (Romine, Fredrickson and Li, 1999). Only single copies of bphA3 and bphA4, coding for \n\nferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase, have been detected in strain F199. The bphA1f gene in strain F199 \n\nis likely to encode the ? subunit of the naphthalene initial dioxygenase, even though its enzymatic \n\nactivity has not been confirmed. In addition, it was verified the presence of at least six bphA1 and bphA2 \n\ndioxygenase gene homologs spread throughout the plasmid. These dioxygenases may be associated with \n\nupper pathways generating either salicylate or phthalate (Waigi et al., 2015). Therefore, the key \n\nadaptation of most PAH-degrading sphingomonad strains is the multiple genes encoding catabolically \n\nversatile enzymes, specifically dioxygenases that can degrade different PAHs. \n\n  The gene organization and regulation of degradative pathways in sphingomonads are very \n\ncomplex comparatively to non-sphingomonads (such as pseudomonads), which reveals an evolutionary \n\ndeviation. This adaptability mechanism is named \u201cflexible\u201d gene organization (i.e. different \n\ncombinations of conserved gene clusters), which benefits in quick and efficient adjustment to new \n\ncompounds in contaminated sites (Basta et al., 2017). \n\n \n\nnar genes \n\n A novel catalytic component of a naphthalene dioxygenase composed by a Rieske [2Fe-2S] \n\ncentre was reported from Rhodococcus sp. strain NCBIMB12038 which is capable of utilizing \n\nnaphthalene as its exclusive carbon and energy source. The nucleotide sequences of narAa and narAb \n\ngenes encode the ? and ? subunits of ISP, respectively. However, these genes are not homologous to \n\ntheir previously characterized counterparts in Pseudomonas (Larkin et al., 1999). It was also described \n\na narB gene coding for cis-naphthalene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase. Once again this nucleotide sequence \n\nshows low overall similarity with nahB from P. putida strain G7 (Kulakov et al., 2000). Nonetheless, \n\nthe organization of naphthalene catabolic genes in strain NCIMV12038 (narAaAbB) is identical to the \n\nnah genes from Pseudomonas species (Habe and Omori, 2003). This dioxygenase coded by the nar \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\ngenes are generally associated with upper pathways that lead to phthalate formation (Cravo-Laureau, \n\n2017). \n\n \n\n \n\nphd genes \n\n The phd genes of Nocardioides sp. strain KP7 are the most studied PAH-catabolic genes in \n\nGram-positive bacteria, and belong to a new class of PAH-catabolic genes because of differences in \n\ngene organization and sequence similarity (Habe and Omori, 2003). This strain is able to grow on \n\nphenanthrene (but not on naphthalene) and the degradation occurs via the phthalate pathway. The genes \n\nresponsible for degradation of phenanthrene to phthalate (phd) are located on the chromosome. The \n\nphdA, phdB, phdC and phdD genes, which encode the ? and ? subunits of the oxygenase component, a \n\nferredoxin, and a ferredoxin reductase, respectively, of phenanthrene dioxygenase were identified. Both \n\nsubunits showed low sequence identity to the ? and ? subunits of other aromatic ring dioxygenases. \n\nRelatively to phdC gene, it codes for a ferredoxin which presents more similarity to the [3Fe-4S] or \n\n[4Fe-4S] type of ferredoxin, but not to the [2Fe-2S] type of ferredoxin found in most PAH dioxygenases. \n\nContrarily, the ferredoxin reductase coded by phdD shows moderate sequence identity to the ferredoxin \n\nreductase of other isofunctional enzymes. All three components (PhdABCD) are indispensable for the \n\neffective dioxygenase activity that converts phenanthrene to his cis-diol compound (Harayama, 2000). \n\nThere are other genes in the cluster (phdEFABGHCD) encoding enzymes responsible for the \n\ntransformation of phenanthrene to 1-hydroxy-2-naphthanoate, such as  dihydridiol dehydrogenase \n\n(phdE), extradiol dioxygenase (phdF), hydratase-aldolase (phdG) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (phdH). \n\nThis gene cluster did not contain the ORF encoding isomerase, found in all PAH catabolic genes from \n\nGram-negative bacteria. In adition, the catabolic genes for the conversion of 1-hydroxy-2-naphthanoate \n\nto phthalate encode 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate dioxygenase (phdI), trans-2\u2019-carboxybenzalpyruvate \n\nhydratase-aldolase (phdJ), and 2-carboxybenzaldehyde dehydrogenase (phdK) (Habe and Omori, 2003). \n\n \n\n1.5 Objectives \n \n\n Focusing on the negative impact of PAHs in environment and human health and in the context \n\nof a current research project of Lab Bugworkers|M&amp;B-BioISI with Biotask Company, adaptive \n\nevolution experiments using microbial consortia from activated sludge and PAHs as selection pressure \n\nhave previously been set up to obtain more efficient strains that can be used as novel bioaugmentation \n\ninocula, leading to a culture collection with over 300 microorganisms. \n\nThe goal of this MSc thesis is to select, identify and characterize at metabolic and genetic levels \n\nthe best PAHs degraders in a sub-set of 47 evolved strains from this previous work in order to develop \n\na novel bioaugmentation consortium.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER II - Materials and Methods \n \n\n2.1 Microbial strains \n \n\nThe strains used in this work belong to the Biotask Bioremediation Culture Collection (BBC) \n\nand have been isolated from adaptive evolution (AE) experiments carried by Pedro Teixeira, in the scope \n\nof his PhD thesis. \n\nThe adaptive evolution experiments were performed in mineral culture medium with the \n\nrecalcitrant compounds anthracene (ANT), phenanthrene (PHE), glyceryl tristearate (GTS) and mineral \n\noil (MiO) as sole carbon source for selective pressure.

The PAHs used in this test were \n\nnaphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene (Sigma Aldrich), studied separately. The inoculum was \n\nprepared by growing each of the 47 strains in TSA at 28\u00b0C overnight. Subsequently, the cells were \n\nrecollected to a 0.8% sodium chloride (NaCl) solution. The optical density of cells was adjusted by using \n\na UV-visible spectrophotometer (Unicam) at 600 nm to OD of 0.01 (1 unit of absorbance corresponds \n\nto 108 bacterial cells.ml-1 and 107 yeast cells.ml-1) (software Vision). The cell inoculum corresponding \n\nto 8 \u00d7106 cells.ml-1 was added to each glass tube. The culture was shaken and incubated under aerobic \n\nconditions in a shaker (Thermo Scientific) at 28\u00b0C and at a speed of 150 rpm during 7 days. Abiotic \n\ncontrol was performed by adding PAH into M9 without inoculum. After 7 days, the remaining PAH \n\nconcentration was analysed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. The assay \n\nwas performed in duplicate. \n\nOptimization tests were performed in order to define the concentration parameters of the \n\ncalibration standards, considering that HPLC\u2019s quantification and detection limits are different for each \n\ncompound. The range of an analytical procedure is the interval between the upper and lower \n\nconcentration of analyte in the sample (these concentrations included) for which has been demonstrated \n\nthat the analytical procedure has a suitable level of precision, accuracy and linearity. For naphthalene, \n\nthe standard concentrations (ng/?L) used were 10.0, 50.0, 100.0, 200.0, 300.0 and 400.0. For anthracene, \n\nthe standard concentrations (ng/?L) used were 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 12.5, 15.0 and 20.0. For \n\nphenanthrene, the standard concentrations (ng/?L) used were 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 12.5, 15.0 and 20.0. \n\n \n\n2.3 Extraction and quantification of PAHs \n\n \n\n After a liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) with 5 mL of chloroform (Carlo Erba) and manual \n\nagitation, the residual PAHs were analysed by HPLC (Beckman Coulter) with C18 reverse phase (5 ?m \n\nparticle size, Length \u00d7 Internal Diameter: 25 cm \u00d7 4.6 mm, Supelco) column under gradient condition \n\nusing acetonitrile (Carlo Erba): water (40:60) (v/v) as mobile phase for 5 minutes and then with linear \n\nincrease of acetonitrile (100:0) (v/v) for 25 minutes. A fluorescence detector (Jasco FP-2020 Plus) \n\nequipped with a data acquisition system (32 Karat) were used at 280 nm for excitation wavelength and \n\n355 nm for emission wavelength. The system operating pressure and flow rate were 2000-3000 psi and \n\n1.0 mL/ min, respectively.  \n\nIn order to validate the HPLC method for quantification of PAHs, the following parameters \n\nwere taken in account. \n\n (i) S electivity /Sp ecif icity \n\nSpecificity is the capacity of an analytical method to separate and quantify the analyte in the \n\npresence of other compounds in the sample like impurities, degradants or matrix. It\u2019s an important \n\nparameter in a quantification assay because it should provide an exact result that allows an accurate \n\nstatement on the content of the analyte in a sample (ICH, 2005). \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\nIn liquid chromatography, selectivity is achieved by choosing optimal columns and setting \n\nchromatographic conditions (mobile phase composition, column temperature and detector wavelength). \n\nTo provide unique selectivity for PAH\u2019s separation, reversed-phase liquid chromatography on \n\nchemically bonded C18 phases was used (Wise et al., 1981).  In addition, the specificity of the method \n\nwas determined by analysing a sample containing all the three PAHs \u2013 naphthalene, anthracene and \n\nphenanthrene - under study, and a good resolution between two peaks (retention times) without overlaps \n\nwas observed. \n\nFor chromatographic procedures, representative chromatograms should be presented to \n\ndemonstrate specificity and individual components should be appropriately labelled (see Appendix F). \n\n \n\n(ii) A ccu ra cy \n\n The accuracy of an analytical method expresses the closeness of agreement between an accepted \n\nreference value and the value found (ICH, 2005). \n\n \n\n(iii) P recision \n\n The precision of an analytical method expresses the closeness of agreement between a series of \n\nmeasurements obtained from multiple sampling of the same homogeneous sample under the prescribed \n\nconditions (ICH, 2005). \n\n \n\n(iv) L imit of d etection  \n\nThe detection limit of an individual analytical method is defined as the lowest amount of analyte \n\nin a sample which can be detected but not necessarily quantitated as an exact value (Shrivastava and \n\nGupta, 2011). It is calculated based on standard deviation of response (?) and slope (s) expressed as: \n\nLOD = \n3.3?\n\n?\n \n\nThe slope may be estimated from the calibration curve. The standard deviation is calculated \n\nthrough the standard deviation of y-intercepts of regression lines.  \n\n \n\n(v) L imit of qua n tif ica tion  \n\n The quantification limit of an individual analytical method is as the lowest amount of analyte in \n\na sample which can be quantitatively determined with suitable precision and accuracy value (Shrivastava \n\nand Gupta, 2011).  It is calculated based on standard deviation of response (?) and slope (s) expressed \n\nas: \n\nLOQ = \n10?\n\n?\n \n\nThe slope may be estimated from the calibration curve. The standard deviation is calculated \n\nthrough the standard deviation of y-intercepts of regression lines.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\n \n\n(vi) C a lib ra tion  ran g e and  lin ea rity  \n\nFor quantification by HPLC, a good calibration is essential to ensure reliable results and it \n\nrequires a serie of standards of increasing concentration in order to create a calibration curve. The \n\nlinearity of an analytical procedure is the capacity (within a given range) to obtain test results which are \n\ndirectly proportional to the concentration of analyte present in the sample. \n\n \n\n2.4 Microbial cell viability \n\n \n\nAssessment of the most probable number (MPN) of viable microbial cells was performed in 96 \n\nmicrowell plates, using 290 \u00b5L of tryptic soy broth (TSB) (Sigma Aldrich), 10 \u00b5L of inoculum from \n\neach 10-fold serial dilution (1 mL final volume). Incubation was performed at 28 \u00b0C for 48h. \n\nFor determination of characteristic number of microorganisms capable of PAHs degradation, \n\ntwo criteria were used. The positive wells criteria consist of using the number of positive wells (wells \n\nthat shows turbidity resulting from growth) in the least concentrated dilution in which all or the highest \n\nnumber of wells were growth-positive and the numbers of the growth-positive wells in the following \n\ntwo higher dilutions were used. The negative wells criterion was also used (no growth is observed) \n\nwhere the lowest dilution where all the wells are negative and the numbers corresponding to the positive \n\nwells of the next two more concentrated dilutions are considered. The characteristic number obtained is \n\nthen multiplied by the dilution factor in order to obtain the MPN values, based on 10-fold dilutions and \n\n3 wells per dilution (n=3), were derived from published McCrady statistical tables (Marques-Pinto and \n\nGalhardo, 1983).  \n\n \n\n2.5 Principal component analysis \n\n \n\nThe results from the HPLC quantification and MPN determination were gathered in a matrix in \n\norder to perform a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using NTSYSpc 2.2 software. The quantitative \n\ndata was standardized by subtracting the average and dividing by the standard deviation. The similarity \n\nwas calculated applying Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient to the standardized matrix. Analysis of the \n\nexplanatory variables for PCs can be found in Appendix G and H. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.6 Molecular identification of strains \n\n \n\nAmplification of 16S rRNA gene was performed in a final volume of 50 ?l with 1x PCR reaction \n\nbuffer (Invitrogen), 2 mM MgCl2, 50 pmol of each primer PA (5\u2019AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCT CAG3\u2019) \n\n(Massol-Deya et al., 1995) and 1392R (5\u2019ACGGGCGGTGTGTRC3\u2019) (Baker et al., 2003), 0.2 mM of \n\ndNTP\u2019s mix, 1 U of Taq polymerase and 1 ?l of template DNA. \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\nAmplifications reactions were performed in a UNO II Thermal Cycler (Biometra, Germany), \n\nwith the following conditions: 3 minutes of initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C, followed by 35 cycles of 1 \n\nminute of denaturation at 94\u00b0C, 1 minute of annealing at 55\u00b0C and 1 minute of extension at 72\u00b0C, and \n\nby a final elongation step of 3 minutes at 72\u00b0C. \n\nPCR products were visualized by gel electrophoresis in a 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel in 0.5x TBE \n\nbuffer (40 mM Tris; 45 mM Boric acid; 1 mM EDTA; pH 8.3) at 90V for 1h. After, the gel was stained \n\nin an 0.5 \u00b5g/mL ethidium bromide solution and photographed in an Alliance 4.7 UV Transilluminator \n\n(UVItec, Cambridge), using Alliance software version 15.15 (Uvitec, Cambridge). PCR products which \n\namplified correctly were provided to Eurofins Genomics to be sequenced through Sanger sequencing. \n\nResults obtained were BLASTed against NCBI database to find the most probable identification. \n\n \n\n \n\n 2.7 Growth curves \n\n \n\nExperiment \nTo evaluate the biodegradative potential of the selected PAH degrading microorganisms, \n\ngrowth curves were performed for single strains and a consortium (a combination of all isolates), using \n\n15 mL of M9 medium and 10 mg of one PAH in Erlenmeyer flasks. Pre-inoculum from each isolate and \n\nthe consortium was added to a flask in order to have 9 x 106 cells/mL, using a UV-visible \n\nspectrophotometer (Unicam) at 600 nm for the adjustment (software Vision).  Each experiment was \n\nmade in duplicate. The experiment was carried out in a shaking incubator (Thermo Scientific) at 28 \u00b0C \n\nand 160 rpm for 15 days. All flasks were capped with cotton wool and covered with aluminium foil. \n\nDuring the 15 days incubation, samples were collected aseptically for bacteria enumeration every 24 \n\nhours for the first 5 days and every 48 hours on the remaining days. For each sample, viable bacterial \n\nnumber was determined by MPN (see section 2.4). The MPN method was validated by counting colony \n\nforming units (CFU). Three strains were randomly chosen to validate each one of the three PAHs and \n\ntriplicates were made, using TSA medium and 100\u00b5L as inoculum which was spread with spheres and \n\nincubated at 28 \u00b0C for 24h. For comparison of strains growth behaviour, the area under the curve (AUC) \n\nwas used. Using the \"Analyse\" tool from GraphPad Prims software,  \n\nTraceability and Confirmation  \nDuring the growth curve assay, the presence of a contaminant in samples was detected. In order \n\nto trace their origin, samples were taken from all flasks and spread on plates with TSA medium. After \n\n48h, colonies were observed with a stereomicroscope and the colonies that appeared to be different were \n\ninoculated in a new plate. Subsequently, DNA from these colonies was extracted by boiling method and \n\nisolates were differentiated by M13 PCR-fingerprinting. The assay was repeated and the results \n\npresented in this work refer to this second assay. At the end of the 15-day assay, samples were also taken \n\nfrom each flask, the microorganisms were grown on plates with TSA medium, DNA from the colonies \n\nobserved after 48h was extracted by boiling method and the isolates were differentiated by M13 PCR-\n\nfingerprinting to confirm the maintenance of isolates of interest at the end of the assay. \n\nDNA was extracted through boiling method, adapted from Sambrook et al. (1989). Biomass \n\nwas collected into a microtube with 50 \u00b5l of TE buffer (10 mM Tris; 1 mM EDTA; pH 8). Tubes were \n\nheated to 100 \u00b0C for 10 minutes in a heating block, in order to lysate the cells and release DNA to the \n\nsolution. Tubes were then centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 10 minutes and supernatant was collected into \n\na new tube. \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\n \n\nM13 PCR-fingerprinting was performed in a total volume of 25 \u00b5l, with 1x PCR buffer \n\n(Invitrogen), 3 mM MgCl2, 25 pmol of primer csM13 (5\u2019GAGGGTGGCGGTTCT3\u2019) (Meyer et al., \n\n1993), 0.2 mM of dNTP\u2019s mix, 1 U of Taq Polymerase and 1 \u00b5l of template DNA. Amplification was \n\nperformed in a UNO II Thermal Cycler (Biometra, Germany), with the following conditions: 5 minutes \n\nof initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of 1 minute of denaturation at 95\u00b0 C, 2 minutes of \n\nannealing at 50 \u00b0C and 2 minutes of extension at 72\u00b0C, and by a final elongation step of 5 minutes at 72 \n\n\u00b0C. \n\nPCR products were separated by gel electrophoresis, together with 1 kb plus DNA ladder, in a \n\n1.2% (w/v) agarose gel in 0.5x TBE buffer (40 mM Tris; 45 mM Boric acid; 1 mM EDTA; pH 8.3). \n\nElectrophoresis was run at 90V for 3h, after which gel was stained in an 0.5 \u00b5g/mL ethidium bromide \n\nsolution and photographed in an Alliance 4.7 UV Transilluminator (Uvitec, Cambridge), using Alliance \n\nsoftware version 15.15 (Uvitec, Cambridge).  \n\n \n\n \n\n2.8 Determination of biosurfactant activity \n\n \n\n After the 15 days of growth experiment, cells and solid carbon source were removed from the \n\nbroth by centrifugation at 4000 g during 10 minutes and the supernatant of each sample was harvested \n\nfor use in the biosurfactant activity assay. \n\nQualitative assay - Emulsification activity \nThe emulsification test was carried out using 1 mL of supernatant with 0.5 mL of n-hexadecane \n\nplaced in a microtube and vortexed for 30s. The samples which produced a stable third layer were chosen \n\nto take part in a larger test using a final volume of 3 mL of supernatant and 3 mL of n-hexadecane. This \n\nsuspension was vortexed for 2 minutes and the height of the emulsion layer was measured after 2h.  \n\nQuantitative assay - Surface tension measurement \n The surface tension of the supernatant was determined using a tensiometer (Kruss Force \n\nTensiometer K100) at 25\u00b0C by the Du No\u00fcy method (Du No\u00fcy, 1925) (see Appendix I). Tensiometers \n\ncalculate the surface tension with aid of an optimally wettable ring suspended from a precision balance. \n\nThe liquid is raised until it contacts with the surface is registered. The sample is then lowered again with \n\nthe purpose of the liquid film produced beneath the ring is stretched. As the film is stretched, a maximum \n\nforce is experienced and that force is measured, allowing the surface tension calculation2. The data was \n\ncollected and analysed by the software Kruss Laboratory Desktop [K100 Surface and Interfacial \n\nTension]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\n2.9 PCR approach to search for genes involved in PAH degradation   \n\n \n\nThe search for genes involved in PAH catabolic pathways was performed through PCR analysis, \n\nusing DNA extracts from the genomic DNA bank of BBC collection (kindly provided by P.

Direct evaluation consists in quantify the \n\ndegradation efficiency through HPLC by obtaining the calibration curves of the compounds \n\nnaphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene and dosing biological samples after growth with the \n\ncompounds of interest as single carbon source. This implies a development of the HPLC method with \n\nparameter optimization and validation. Indirect evaluation corresponds to obtaining the cellular viability \n\nin the biological samples through MPN, also after growth with the compounds of interest as single \n\ncarbon source. \n\n \n\n3.1.1 HPLC \u2013 Calibration curves with simple linear regression \n \n\nCalibration curves of one analyte were generated by plotting peak areas versus the standard \n\nconcentrations (Figure 5A, 5C, 5E). For each concentration, triplicates were performed. \n\nThe calibration curves were created using simple linear regression as statistical method because \n\nit allows the study of relationships between two quantitative variables. In this case, the x variable, \n\nregarded as the predictor, explanatory or independent variable, is the range of standard concentrations \n\n(ng/?L) of each PAH whereas the y variable, regarded as the response, outcome or dependent variable \n\nis the peak area quantified by HPLC. \n\nIn order to find the best fitting line for this data set, the least squares criterion was applied where \n\nthe residual error (or prediction error), i.e. the difference between the value predicted by the regression \n\nline and the observed value, is as small as possible.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe regression equation y = b1x + b0, that makes the sum of the squared residual error the \n\nsmallest it can be, and other important regression analysis parameters such as retention times (RT) for \n\nnaphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene are summarized in Table 3. \n\n \n\nFigure 5 Calibration curves with linear regression (A, C, E) and residual plot (B, D, F) for naphthalene, anthracene \n\nand phenanthrene.

Residuals were transformed in standardized residuals by \n\ndividing them by their standard deviation, making them unitless and directly comparable.  It can be \n\nobserved that the standardized residuals are randomly distributed on the plot and they form a roughly \n\nhorizontal band around the residual zero line. However, a data point on ANT\u2019s plot and another data \n\npoint on NAP\u2019s plot stand out from the random pattern of the other residuals. It is known that, when \n\ndata is normally distributed, 95% of the measurements will present standardized residuals values higher \n\nthan -2 and smaller than 2. Therefore, any observations greater than 2 or smaller than 2 should be flagged \n\nas being an outlier. This happened for one of the 400 ng/\u00b5L NAP triplicates. When standardized \n\nresiduals are greater than 3 or smaller than 3, they are considered as extreme outliers, which is the case \n\nof one of the 10 ng/\u00b5L ANT triplicates. Because the data sets are small, the points who were identified \n\nas outliers where excluded from the regression line (Zar, 2010). \n\n For the three compounds, the R2 value - coefficient of determination - is greater than 95% which \n\nindicates a strong linear relationship between the response y and the x predictor. This means that in the \n\ncase of naphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene, respectively 99%, 99.84% and 97.34% of the peak \n\narea total variation is explained by the variation in the standard concentration and the rest of the variation \n\nis due to random error.  \n\nBoth naphthalene and phenanthrene calibration presented a high accuracy  (? 99.9%) confirming \n\nthat the regression line provides estimated concentration values coinciding with the known standard \n\nconcentrations. Yet, the anthracene calibration has a higher precision that translates into a lower standard \n\ndeviation compared to naphthalene precision, which means that for it presents more coincident values \n\nin a series of concentration measurements taken from same sample by multiple injections. The \n\nphenanthrene calibration, although displaying the lowest percentage of accuracy and precision .shows \n\nan acceptable linearity. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\n \n\n3.1.2 HPLC \u2013 Strains degradation efficiency \n\n \n\nIn a previous work, adaptive evolution experiments were performed in mineral medium M9 with \n\ndifferent pollutants as sole carbon source for selective pressure. The WWTP inoculum was kept for over \n\n50 cycles and this strategy preserves the dominant microbial strains, leading to wash-out of the weakest \n\nones.  The 47 strains in the present work were obtained from different experiments at several cycles and \n\nfrom selective solid media (ANT, PHE, GTS and MiO) and represent the diversity present on BBC \n\ncollection. \n\nThe residual PAH resulting from the microbial degradation was quantified by HPLC. Results \n\nare presented according to the cycle of adaptive evolution corresponding to strain\u2019s isolation in order to \n\nassess the effectiveness of microbial adaptation (Figure 6). The degradation efficiency presented is \n\nrelative considering the maximum and minimum degradation of each of the PAHs, for the set of strains. \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 6 Efficiency of degradation of 47 strains relative to the maximum and minimum value of degradation \n\nobtained in each of the PAHs after 15 days growth experiment. The efficiency values represented here range from \n\n0 to 1, where the worst degrader correspond to 0 and the best degrader correspond to 1. The graphs are organized \n\nby the 6 cycles of adaptive evolution from which the 47 strains under study come from. The bars refer to the mean \n\n\u00b1 standard deviation. \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\n \n\nThe results showed that 90% of the 20 strains belonging to cycles 5, 12, 16, 20 and 21 degraded \n\nmore easily naphthalene compared to anthracene and phenanthrene. This is expected due to the chemical \n\nstructure of the compounds since naphthalene has two benzene rings compared to anthracene and \n\nphenanthrene which have three, revealing a greater ability of the microorganisms to open the \n\nnaphthalene\u2019s rings, since it involves fewer catabolic enzymatic steps (Figure 1). This corroborates that \n\nthe degradation efficiency of the microorganisms decreases with increasing structural complexity of \n\nPAH (LJS, 2016). \n\nAnother factor that may justify the percentages of degradation efficiency is the different \n\nsolubilities of the compounds in aqueous medium (M9), expressed in moles of solute per liter of solution. \n\nAlthough PAHs non-polar structures prevent dissolution in water, these compounds are not completely \n\ninsoluble, particularly the low molecular weight PAHs (Abdel-Shafy and Mansour, 2016). For example, \n\nnaphthalene\u2019s aqueous solubility at 25\u00b0C is 249 \u00b5mol/L, a value that represents low water solubility but \n\nis much higher than anthracene and phenanthrene\u2019s solubilities, which correspond to 0.37 \u00b5mol/L and \n\n7.2  \u00b5mol/L at 25\u00b0C, respectively (Pearlman et al., 1984). Therefore, small amounts of PAHs do dissolve \n\nin water, where they become bioavailable. As naphthalene presents the highest water solubility, then it \n\nis the PAH with greater availability for microbial degradation. \n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to mention a relevant naphthalene\u2019s property that can also explain its \n\nhigher percentage of degradation efficiency. Naphthalene is a solid that sublimes at atmospheric \n\ntemperature and pressure (Carrol, 2014). Thus, if naphthalene is able to go directly from the solid to the \n\nvapor phase, the reduction in naphthalene concentration may be due to loss of the compound to the air, \n\ninstead of microbial degradation. However, the experiment conditions were the same for all strains in \n\nterms of amount of naphthalene and the volume of M9 medium, so it is expected that the losses were \n\nequally distributed and the differences observed between strains should be explained by their \n\nmetabolism.  \n\nAbout the three-ring PAHs, an overall tendency for a higher anthracene degradation efficiency \n\nis present, except for cycle 20.  \n\nThe standard deviations do not seem to be related to HPLC sensitivity because there are \n\nduplicates that have exactly the same value which translates into very low standard deviations. The \n\ndifferences can be explained by the fact that these are biological replicates where factors such as the \n\ndifferent accessibility of the microorganisms to the solid substrate in the different samples, the microbial \n\nmetabolism itself and adaptation to the medium with the complex carbon source as the only source of \n\ncarbon and energy have influence on degradative behaviour. \n\nInterestingly, it is in cycle 29 that the highest values of degradation efficiency are observed. \n\nThis result corroborates the success of the adaptive evolution experiment since the most evolved strains \n\nare the ones with the highest degradation efficiency. This may be due to the fact that over time these \n\nhave been selected by the natural pressure of having only naphthalene, anthracene or phenanthrene as \n\nthe sole carbon source, which translates into a greater metabolic, physiological and genomic adaptation \n\nin terms of gene expression and protein synthesis as well as in the production of biosurfactants or \n\nbiofilms. Accordingly, these adaptations may translate into greater ease in using these compounds in \n\ntheir metabolism. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\n \n\n3.1.3 MPN\u2013 Strains viability \n \n\nIn order to analyse indirectly the degradation of PAHs, assessment of the viability of strains at \n\nthe end of the degradation assays were performed by MPN. This method estimates the concentration \n\n(cells/mL) of viable microorganisms in a sample by replicate liquid broth growth in ten-fold dilutions. \n\nMPN was used for the viability experiment because the substrates under study \u2013 naphthalene, anthracene \n\nand phenanthrene - are solid at strain\u2019s growth temperature (28\u00baC) and therefore they would interfere in \n\nmethods that would use the optical density at 600 nm as a monitoring parameter.  \n\nIt is observed in Figure 7 that 93,62% of strains showed growth above the concentration of cells \n\n/ ml from the initial inoculum. This result is expected because these microorganisms have been selected \n\nfrom adaptive evolution experiments for being interesting for their degradation capacity. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nConsidering that for all MPN\u2019s tests, the initial inoculum concentration used was 8 x 106 \n\ncells.mL-1 and strains have the same amount of available PAH as the sole carbon source, the observed \n\ndifferences in viability results present on Figure are due to lower or higher degradation efficiency.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7 Representation of the distribution of the 47 strains under study in terms of absence /presence of viability \n\nat the end of the 15 days of degradation experiment. \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8 Cell viability expressed in log of cells per mL of the 47 strains which grow for 15 days with PAHs under \n\nstudy as sole carbon source. The line in the graphs corresponds to reference value 6.90 corresponding to the 8 x \n\n106 cells that were inoculated first. \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\n \n\nFor strains BBC|293, BBC|309 and BBC|314 that exhibited a cells/mL value lower than the \n\ninitial inoculum, it can be concluded that there was a loss of viability. This phenomenon could be due \n\nto an inability of the strain to metabolize the compounds naphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene \n\nalthough this is not expected since they were selected from experiments where they had pollutants as \n\nthe only source of carbon. Strain BBC|293 of cycle 5 and strain BBC|314 of cycle 20 are derived from \n\nthe experience of adaptive evolution in phenanthrene and was also isolated in solid medium with \n\nphenanthrene. Strain BBC|309 of cycle 16 comes from the experience in glyceryl tristearate and was \n\nalso isolated in solid medium containing glyceryl tristearate. It should be noted that in all three cases, \n\nthe experience of adaptive evolution and the medium in which the strains were isolated contains the \n\nsame compound as the sole carbon source, which does not give evidence of a high metabolic plasticity. \n\nStrains BBC|293, BBC|309 and BBC|314 demonstrated less viability in naphthalene relative to \n\nanthracene and phenanthrene. Compared to HPLC results (Figure 5), there is no consistency in this case \n\nbecause the degradation efficiency of naphthalene is higher and the reasons for this have already been \n\nenumerated above. In the other compounds, for strain BBC|293 there is concordance since for the \n\nanthracene presented higher viability and degradation efficiency than for phenanthrene, although its \n\nexperience of adaptive evolution and its isolation contained phenanthrene as a single carbon source. As \n\nto strain BBC|309, it presents equal results in terms of cell viability and a greater efficiency of anthracene \n\ndegradation. This bacteria was presumptively identified in the scope of Pedro Teixeira\u2019s work as \n\nbelonging to the genus Shinella. A species belonging to the genus Shinella described as capable of \n\nachieving greater degradation of anthracene was isolated from activated sludge bioreactor treating \n\nmunicipal wastewater (Ntougias et al., 2015). It is important to mention that this strain was once again \n\nisolated in cycle 20 of adaptive evolution in glyceryl tristearate, reinforcing the idea of its ability to \n\nsurvive having the pollutant as the only source of carbon. For strain BBC|314, the HPLC results show a \n\nhigher efficiency in phenanthrene degradation which is consistent with its origin in an experience of \n\nadaptive evolution and isolation in phenanthrene. However, the lowest viability was also found for that \n\ncompound. As for naphthalene and anthracene, the strain had the same viability value for both.  \n\nConsidering the dendrogram constructed from the profiles obtained by PCR-fingerprinting \n\n(using primers M13, Ph, GTG5, Appendix D), it should be noted that strain BBC|293 and strain BBC|314 \n\nare phylogenetically close with a similarity higher than 90%. In addition, the fact that they respectively \n\nbelong to evolution cycle 5 and 20 indicates that the most recent strain may be the result of the evolution \n\nof the older strain. \n\nNevertheless, the absence of concordance between HPLC and MPN can be explained not by \n\nstrains degradation low efficiency but by the growth curve characteristics. The final phase of growth is \n\nthe death phase where a net loss of culturable cells is observed. During this phase, total count of \n\nmicroorganisms may remain constant but the viable count decreases by various reasons, such as \n\ndepletion of nutrients.  In some cases, death is accompanied by actual cell lysis which results in \n\naccumulation of toxic products in addition to the metabolites already produced during growth.  \n\nOnce again, it can be seen that the highest values of cell viability are observed in cycle 29. This \n\nresult also corroborates the success of the adaptive evolution experiment since the most evolved strains \n\nare the ones with the greatest growth. This may be due to the fact that over time these have been selected \n\nby the natural pressure of having only naphthalene, anthracene or phenanthrene as the sole source of \n\ncarbon, which translates into greater metabolic, physiological and genomic adaptation and consequently \n\ngreater ease to grow in environments with these pollutants. \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\n \n\n3.2 Selection of best PAH degraders \n \n\nIn order to evaluate the PAHs degradation potential of 47 isolates, a degradation assay was \n\ncarried out, having the hydrocarbons naphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene as the only source of \n\ncarbon and energy.  Further quantification of residual substrate was performed using HPLC. In addition, \n\nthe MPN method was also applied to evaluate the viability of the isolates at the end of the assay.  \n\nThese results presented values in mg/mL of residual substrate for naphthalene (HPLC|NAP), \n\nanthracene (HPLC|ANT) and phenanthrene (HPLC|PHE) and values of cells/mL of the isolates grown \n\nin naphthalene (MNP|NAP), anthracene (MNP|ANT) and phenanthrene (MNP|PHE). A univariate \n\nanalysis of these two data sets composed of six variables is limited because it does not consider the \n\npossible correlations between the amount of residual substrate resulting from degradation and  viability \n\nof microorganisms in presence of that same substrate. In this case, multivariate analysis can be used to \n\nassess the best PAH degraders by possibly forming groups based on the degradation capability of each \n\nisolate, reducing the number of variables involved in the study (Fraga et al., 2016). \n\nThere are numerous approaches in the area of multivariate analysis that allow joint analysis of \n\ndifferent traits. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistic method that uses an orthogonal \n\ntransformation to reduce a set of correlated variables into a set of uncorrelated new variables, called \n\nprincipal components (PCs), with minimal loss of information (Hongyu et al., 2016). \n\nPCs are calculated through linear combinations of the original variables with eigenvectors. The \n\nabsolute value of an eigenvector determines the importance of the traits in a principal component. Each \n\neigenvector is calculated from an eigenvalue of the correlation matrix of the data, which is related to the \n\nvariance of each principal component. The first principal component (PC1) explains the highest \n\npercentage of the total variance, the second principal component (PC2) explains the second most, and \n\nso on, until all of the variance is explained (Fraga et al., 2016). To choose principal components that \n\nexplained most of the variation in the data set, generally the Kaiser criterion is used, where PCs with \n\neigenvalues greater than unity (?i ? 1) are selected (Kaiser, 1958). \n\nThe mean results from the measurements of the six variables from the 47 isolates were gathered \n\nin a matrix in order to perform PCA. The data were standardized by subtracting the average and dividing \n\nby the standard deviation; similarity was calculated applying Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient to the \n\nstandardized matrix.  \n\n \n\nPC1, PC2 and PC3 were selected because they explain 82% (>75%) of the variance of the results \n\n(Table 4). Analysis of the correlation of original variables with the PCs (Table 5), revealed that PC1 \n\nrepresents two kinds of responses along the axis: strain\u2019s ability to grow on phenanthrene according to \n\nMPN and strain\u2019s degradation efficiency for naphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene consistent with \n\nHPLC results; PC2 represents a gradient in strain\u2019s ability to grow on naphthalene according to MPN \n\nand PC3 represented a gradient in strain\u2019s ability to grow on anthracene according to MPN. A detailed \n\nanalysis of the explanatory variables for PC1, PC2, PC3, PC4, PC5 and PC6 can be found in Appendix \n\nG and H. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4 Eigenvalues and respective variance (%) explained by the new variables \u2013 principal components. \n\nPrincipal Component (PC) Eigenvalue (?i) % Variance  % Variance (accumulated) \n\nPC1 2,57 42,78 42,78 \n\nPC2 1,38 22,98 65,77 \n\nPC3 0,99 16,43 82,20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 5 PC loadings (correlation coefficients of original variables and PCs). \n\nOriginal Variable PC1 PC2 PC3 \n\nMPN|ANT 0,16 0,27 0,94 \n\nMPN|NAP 0,60 0,69 -0,04 \n\nMPN|PHE 0,71 0,32 -0,13 \n\nHPLC|ANT -0,80 0,57 -0,07 \n\nHPLC|NAP -0,62 -0,35 0,26 \n\nHPLC|PHE -0,82 0,53 -0,089 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA PCA of this dataset was carried out with the aim of obtain a clearer perception of the strain\u2019s \n\nperformance, as each strain\u2019s position in this analysis reflecting its global response in terms of the \n\ndegradability and subsequent growth on three compounds studied. This analysis revealed mostly a \n\ndistribution according to their respective isolation medium and adaptive evolution cycle, as evidenced \n\nin Figure 9 and Figure 10, respectively. \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9 Spatial distribution of the strains considering the three-dimensional space formed by the 3 \n\nnew variables \u2013 principal components.

The adaptive evolution cycle from which the strains were \n\nisolated is evidenced by different colors. \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\n \n\nThe distribution of the strains by the space formed by the PCs can be observed in Figure 9 where \n\nthe isolation medium is highlighted through different colours. \n\nThe phenanthrene isolation medium is the one containing the largest number of strains, which \n\nare distributed widely across the space. In this medium, is verified the existence of strains that present \n\nthe greatest discrepancies between MPN and HPLC, especially with anthracene as the only source of \n\ncarbon. For example, the BBC|300 strain, derived from the experience of adaptive evolution in \n\nphenanthrene and isolated in phenanthrene in cycle 16, shows high viability, but did not show a high \n\ndegradation efficiency. In the case of the BBC|295 strain, originating from the experience of adaptive \n\nevolution in phenanthrene and isolated in phenanthrene in cycle 16, the opposite is found with an \n\nintermediate degradation efficiency and very low viability. As regards to naphthalene as the sole source \n\nof carbon, both a highly viable strain (BBC|297 from the experience of adaptive evolution with \n\nphenanthrene and isolated in phenanthrene at cycle 16) and a strain with the lowest viability (BBC|364 \n\noriginating from the experience of adaptive evolution with phenanthrene and isolated in phenanthrene \n\nin cycle 29) are present. \n\nApparently,  strains isolated in phenanthrene are able to degrade and grow in phenanthrene \n\nefficiently. However, for naphthalene and anthracene, there is a great variability in the response of the \n\ndifferent strains in terms of efficiency and viability, reflecting a specialization in the degradation of \n\nphenanthrene as a source of complex carbon. \n\nAs for strains isolated in anthracene, it can be observed that they are concentrated in the zone \n\ncorresponding to high values of degradation efficiency and viability. Note that the BBC|398 strain comes \n\nfrom an adaptive evolution experiment in lubricating oil and has been isolated in anthracene. \n\nInterestingly, this strain has the best position in terms of the use of phenanthrene as the only available \n\ncarbon source (in combination with BBC|392). Thus, it can be concluded that it presents metabolic \n\nplasticity in terms of the use of different degradation pathways for different carbon sources. \n\nThe strains isolated in lubricating oil should also be emphasised because they are located in the \n\nzone of the space corresponding to the best positions regarding the use of naphthalene, anthracene and \n\nphenanthrene. This is the case of the promising BBC|392 strain, derived from the experience of adaptive \n\nevolution in glyceryl tristearate and isolated in lubricating oil in cycle 29, which shows the best results \n\nfor anthracene and phenanthrene, being also relatively well positioned for naphthalene. \n\nThe strains belonging to the glyceryl tristearate and tryptic soy agar media are located in the \n\ncentral zone of the graph, not revealing an interesting degradative potential with respect to the three \n\ncarbon sources. \n\nIn addition, from the distribution of the strains in the space of the PCs presented in Figure 10, \n\nthe cycle of adaptive evolution to which they belong were highlighted with different colours. \n\nFurthermore, a dendrogram was constructed from the coordinates of the strains in the space of the PCs \n\n(using the euclidean distance and average linkage) and the different clusters \u2013 I to IV \u2013 are also \n\nhighlighted in grey. \n\nIt is noteworthy that the strains belonging to cycle 29 constitute the majority of cluster II which \n\nis located in the zone where the best PAH degraders are expected to be. This may be considered as \n\nevidence of the success of the adaptive evolution experience. \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\n \n\nThe strains of cycles 5, 12, 16, 20 and 21 are mostly located in cluster I that occupies the central \n\nzone of the graph with an intermediate degradability that does not show much interest for the objective \n\nof this work. \n\n Note that it is in cycle 16 that the greatest variability between HPLC and MPN is found as \n\nalready explained above for the strains BBC|300 and BBC|295. \n\nClusters IV and V formed by strains BBC|368 and BBC|300, respectively, have the most \n\nextreme and discrepant values. Cluster III also does not have strains that exhibit high degradation \n\nefficiencies.  \n\nBy analysing the graph of principal components and considering the adaptive evolution cycle \n\nand the isolation medium, strains BBC|297, BBC|392 and BBC|398 were selected for further study: \n\n(i) Strain BBC|297 was selected because it showed high growth in naphthalene, anthracene \n\nand phenanthrene. Although it belongs to an intermediate cycle of adaptive evolution \n\n(cycle 16) it was thought that it would be interesting to compare it with strains from \n\nrecent cycles that are expected to be more evolved. \n\n(ii) Strain BBC|392 has the best positioning on the graph in terms of HPLC and NMP results \n\nfor all the three carbon sources. \n\n(iii) Strain BBC|398 presents the best results for naphthalene and phenanthrene. \n\nIn addition to the strains selected by the PCA, at that time another strain (BBC|652) was added \n\nto the BBC collection, identified and studied simultaneously. After PCA selection and during the first \n\ngrowth experiment, a contaminant capable of growth in the abiotic controls of naphthalene, anthracene \n\nand phenanthrene was identified. PCR fingerprinting was performed with DNA extracted from all the \n\napparently distinct colonies in all the samples of the experiment. It was concluded that the \n\nmicroorganism did not belong to the collection, possibly referring to an environmental contaminant \n\nwhose origin goes back to one of the solutions used for make the M9 mineral medium. A decision was \n\nmade to include in future studies due to the fact that strain BBC|652 presents a degradative behaviour \n\nas its viability increased over time in the presence of the complex carbon sources under study.

The bacterial16S rRNA gene sequencing results allowed to presumptively identify strains \n\nBBC|297 and BBC|398 as belonging to the genus Pseudomonas and strain BBC|392 as a member of the \n\ngenus Acinetobacter. This is consistent with the genomic relatedness of the three strains (Appendix D) \n\nwhere it was possible to conclude that strains BBC|297 and BBC|398 are in the same cluster and that \n\nstrain BBC|392 is located in a more distant cluster. \n\nTable 6 Results regarding the partial sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene. \n\nStrain Hit Taxonomy1 \nQuery Length \n\n(nt) \nCover % Identity % \n\nBBC|297 \n\nBacteria   \n\nProteobacteria \n\nGammaproteobacteria \n\nPseudomonadales \n\nPseudomonadaceae \n\nPseudomonas \n\n1176 \n\n \n\n99 \n\n \n\n \n\n99 \n\n \n\nBBC|392 \n\n \n\nBacteria \n\nProteobacteria \n\nGammaproteobacteria \n\nPseudomonadales \n\nMoraxellaceae \n\nAcinetobacter \n \n\n1079 99 99 \n\nBBC|398 \n\n \n\nBacteria \n\nProteobacteria \n\nGammaproteobacteria \n\nPseudomonadales \n\nPseudomonadaceae \n\nPseudomonas \n \n\n1146 99 99 \n\nBBC|652 \n\nBacteria   \n\nProteobacteria \n\nBetaproteobacteria  \n\nBurkholderiales \n\nBurkholderiaceae \n\nParaburkholderia \n\n1169 99 99 \n\n \n\n                           1 The ranks of domain, phylum, class, order, family ang genus are presented. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\n \n\n3.4 Characterization of best PAH degraders \n \n\nFollowing the identification of selected strains - BBC|297, BBC|392, BBC|398 and BBC|652 - \n\ndifferent studies were carried out to gather as much information as possible about the microorganisms \n\nthat may explain their degradative capacity. It is important to mention that the consortium was only \n\ncomposed of BBC|297, BBC|392 and BBC|398 strains - the evolved strains. \n\nInitially, the aim was to understand and differentiate the performance of the strains over time in \n\nterms of viability with naphthalene, anthracene or phenanthrene as the only carbon source through the \n\nestablishment of growth curves. \n\nSubsequently, in the metabolic terms, the possible production of biosurfactants by the strains \n\nwas investigated as a strategy to solubilize the pollutant compounds and, consequently, to increase their \n\ndegradation efficiency. \n\nFinally, a search for functional genes associated with PAH catabolism and growth on catabolism \n\nintermediate substrate was made in order to unveil the possible metabolic pathways of degradation that \n\ncould explain the degradative behaviour of each strain. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\n \n\n3.4.1 Comparison of growth curves \n \n\nIn order to monitor the ability of the selected strains to grow of selected strains - BBC|297, \n\nBBC|392, BBC|398 and BBC|652 - in the presence of different carbon sources, growth curves were \n\ncarried out for 15 days, being the evaluation parameter the cell viability by MPN. The results are plotted \n\nin Figure 11. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 11 Growth curves for the selected strains - BBC|297, BBC|392, BBC|398 and BBC|652 - having \n\nnaphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene and glucose as the carbon source for 15 days. In gray is also depicted the \n\nbiotic control of the strain without any carbon source. \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\n \n\nGrowth experiments were performed having naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene or glucose \n\nas the sole source of carbon. The use of glucose aims to observe the behaviour in the presence of a \n\nsimple and easily metabolized carbon source compared to the PAHs, which are complex carbon sources. \n\nIt can be seen in Figure 11 that the greatest viability values over time are obtained having glucose as the \n\nsole carbon source in all strains. \n\n All experiments started with the same initial inoculum. For strains BBC|297 and BBC|398 it is \n\nfound that during the first 24 hours there is an increase of approximately 1-log step and 2-log steps in \n\nthe presence of the PAHs or glucose as the sole carbon source, respectively. In the case of strain \n\nBBC|297 a stabilization phase is observed after this increase in all growth curves up to 288 hours. \n\nThereafter, the strain maintains the viability value for glucose but for the three PAHs there is a \n\nsubstantial increase in the viability value suggesting the possibility of bi-phasic growth. The biphasic \n\ngrowth occurs when bacteria have distinct carbon sources, one of which is completely consumed before \n\nthe bacterial synthetic machinery begins to consume the second carbon source (Cossio et al., 2012). In \n\nthis case, the strains are supplemented with only one carbon source. However, when observing the \n\ncontrol that does not have any carbon source can be observed that during the 336 hours it maintains \n\nsome viability. This suggests that these strains are able to remain viable even without addition of a \n\ncarbon source, entering a latency state or using products resulting from the autolysis of microorganisms \n\nand products of population metabolism as carbon source. This phenomenon observed here for all strains \n\nmay be of interest in the production of commercial liquid inoculum which maintains viability for several \n\ndays (at least 15 days). When the cells adapt to the medium with the complex carbon source and activate \n\nthe genetic and enzymatic machinery necessary for its catabolism, then the second phase of growth \n\nenable higher viability values. For the strain BBC|398, a stabilization phase is also present in all growth \n\ncurves up to approximately 288h. From this, what appears to be a two-phase growth in anthracene, while \n\nfor naphthalene and phenanthrene there is a decrease in growth.  \n\nStrain BBC|392 achieves the increase of 1-log step in the presence of glucose at 48 hours. \n\nGrowth with the 3 PAHs remains approximately stable at a viability value close to the initial inoculum \n\nvalue from the start up to 240 hours. Thereafter an increase in viability for anthracene and phenanthrene \n\nis achieved up to the viability value obtained in the presence of glucose. Relative to naphthalene, there \n\nis a decrease in viability. The discrepancies between the high initial screening results and the low \n\nviability results in this experiment may be due to the fact that a different starting amount of inoculum \n\ncould have been used since this bacteria tends to aggregate. \n\n As for strain BBC|652, the increase of 2-log step in the presence of glucose at 24 hours is \n\nobserved. This strain exhibits different growth behaviours with the three complex carbon sources. \n\nDespite presenting a small initial decrease possibly due to adaptation to the complex carbon source, \n\nelevated and increasing viability values were observed after 24 hours in the presence of phenanthrene, \n\nreaching a value higher than the value of registered viability after 336 hours in the presence of glucose. \n\nFor the naphthalene it presents an intermediate and increasing growth from the 144 hours reaching the \n\nviability value registered in the presence of glucose at 336 hours. In the presence of anthracene, the \n\nstrain has the lowest viability values, noting an increase from 240 hours, but not reaching the viability \n\nvalues recorded in the presence of glucose. \n\n The consortium presents initially an increase of 3-log step in the presence of glucose and a 1-\n\nlog step in the presence of each of the three PAHs. The viability values remain relatively stable during \n\nthe 336 hours never reaching the viability values recorded in the presence of glucose. From 288 hours a \n\nslight increase in the three growth curves corresponding to the three PAHs is observed, being this \n\nincrease more evident in the case of phenanthrene. \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\n \n\nFrom the growth curves, it can be concluded that in all cases in the presence of PAHs there is \n\nan adaptation phase corresponding to a plateau in the graph, that represents the adaptation of the \n\nmicroorganisms to a new culture medium and the exposure to complex carbon sources. The initial \n\ngrowth observed in some cases may be due, for example, to the fact that the bacteria present in the initial \n\ninoculum were growing in the general medium TSA and presented high metabolic rates and \n\nconsequently a high fitness, that is, the reproduction rate was high. It is further noted that at 240 to 288 \n\nhours corresponding to days 10 and 12 of the experiment, a substantial growth in the complex carbon \n\nsources is generally observed, suggesting the existence of an initial phase of growth and a secondary \n\nphase where the microorganisms access the substrate and are able to metabolize it more efficiently. \n\n In order to compare the strains with each other, the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated \n\nand the percentages of AUC in each condition relative to the maximum AUC in glucose was determined \n\nfor each strain. The AUC value in glucose from the consortium, being the maximum value, was used as \n\nthe reference value. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGraph A of Figure 12 shows the distribution of percentages of relative growth in each PAH \n\norganized by the strain and referring to the 15 days of growth. Overall, most of the values are between \n\n80% and 90%. It should be noted that the values found below 80% refer only to the BBC|392 and \n\nBBC|652 strains, which again reinforces the idea of being less efficient PAH degraders. In fact,  \n\nBBC|392 strain exhibits the worst result as most growth percentages are below 80%, with naphthalene \n\nbeing the carbon source with the lowest value, followed by phenanthrene having both PAHs lower \n\npercentages than the control. This may be due to the inability of to deal with the toxicity inherent to \n\nnaphthalene and the greater complexity of phenanthrene as a carbon source. Strain BBC|652 exhibits a \n\nvery disperse behaviour with a high range of percentages of relative growth in different PAHs. \n\nInterestingly, this strain has a greater facility in degrading phenanthrene, the more complex carbon \n\nsource. Furthermore, strain BBC|652 also shows the greatest discrepancy between growth percentages \n\nwithout carbon source - control - and in the presence of complex carbon sources. The highest relative \n\ngrowth percentages occur for the BBC|297 and BBC|398 strains, with the former apparently more easily \n\nFigure 12 Representation of the relative growths (%) of each strain in each PAH and its abiotic control. All growth \n\nvalues are relative to the reference value which is the viability value of glucose for each strain. (A) Relative growths \n\nare organized by strain and correspond to 15 days of experience. (B) Relative growths are organized by strain and \n\ncorrespond to the last 48h of the experiment.  \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n\n \n\ndegrading anthracene. Concerning the consortium, it is interesting to note that the percentages are \n\nrelatively close and high, with no particular carbon source being highlighted. \n\nGraph B of Figure 12 also shows the distribution of percentages of relative growth in each PAH \n\norganized by the strain, but referring only to the last 48 hours of the growth experiment (between 288 \n\nand 336 hours), since it was within this time interval that there was a general change in the degradative \n\nbehaviour in the strains with an increase of relative growth percentages. \n\nThe most interesting result belongs to strain BBC|297 since it is observed that percentages \n\nrelative to growth in the presence of PAHs increased to values greater than 90% and to the percentage \n\nof control, with anthracene maintaining the highest value. This strain comes from the adaptive evolution \n\nand isolation medium with phenanthrene as the only source of carbon. \n\nIn the case of the BBC|398 strain it is also curious to note the relevant increase in the percentage \n\nof anthracene growth to a value greater than 90%, with naphthalene and phenanthrene having values \n\nsimilar to or lower than control, which may suggest a possible specialization of the strain on anthracene \n\ndegradation. This result is interesting because the strain BBC|398 was isolated in anthracene-containing \n\nmedium as the sole carbon source from an adaptive evolution experiment in lubricant oil. \n\nFor the strain BBC|392, an increase in the relative percentages of growth in anthracene and \n\nphenanthrene is observed to values greater than 80% whereas in naphthalene a decrease is still observed \n\nbelow 70%. The strain BBC|652 maintains the trend shown in Graph A, increasing its relative growth \n\npercentages overall. \n\nThe consortium also shows an increase in the relative percentages of growth, highlighting \n\nanthracene and phenanthrene with values higher than control. At this time naphthalene exhibits a value \n\nsimilar to the control, decreasing the degradation efficiency of this compound, again possibly due to the \n\naccumulation of toxic products. It may be concluded that the consortium does not exhibit a degradative \n\nbehaviour that stands out in relation to the strains growing singly but positions at high relative growth \n\nvalues. This may be related to the fact that the microbial consortium needs a period of adaptation, which \n\nconsists of pre-enrichment and enrichment phases that depend on the substrate availability and the ability \n\nof the microorganisms composing it to degrade it. Comparative studies of degradation of aromatic \n\nhydrocarbons in crude oil using pure bacterial species and mixed bacterial consortium showed that the \n\nbacterial consortia had a higher rate of degradation (51.8%) than a single Pseudomonas sp. (40.3%) \n\nduring 40 days incubation period (Cerqueira et al., 2011).  In the present work, the strains were obtained \n\nfrom wastewater which commonly contains microorganisms that not only contains microorganisms that \n\nare already part of a natural consortia. It is reported that bacterial species have synergistic interactions \n\namongst themselves which enhance PAHs degradation. Due to these interactions between consortium \n\nmembers, it is suggested that possibly the first species degrades the substrate which may obstruct further \n\ndegradation of compounds by the second species. Then, the second species degrades the compounds left \n\nhalf-degraded. The degradative capacity of any microbial consortium is not certainly the result of adding \n\ntogether the capacities of individual strains that form the association. Since microorganisms present \n\ndifferent PAHs degradation efficiencies, when a consortium of them is used to degrade various forms \n\nof hydrocarbons in a contaminated site, the total degradation is more effective but synergistic and \n\nantagonistic interactions and partition of compounds utilized for microbial metabolism should be \n\nconsidered (Gupta et al., 2016).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\n \n\n3.4.2 Evaluation of biosurfactant production \n \n\nAfter 15 days of growth in M9 supplemented with naphthalene, anthracene or phenanthrene as \n\nsole carbon source, a preliminary study with the selected strains - BBC|297, BBC|392, BBC|398 and \n\nBBC|652 - was carried out to investigate the possible production of biosurfactants by these \n\nmicroorganisms. \n\nInitially, an emulsification test was performed. The aim of this qualitative study is to evaluate \n\nwhich strains present biosurfactant production potential by direct observation of emulsion formation \n\nafter addition of hexadecane between the aqueous and organic phases.  \n\nOf the four strains tested, it was only possible to verify stable emulsion formation for the \n\nBBC|392 and BBC|398 strains. These two strains were identified as potentially biosurfactant producers \n\nand selected for a quantitative study, with the determination of surface tension in order to measure the \n\nsurface activity of biosurfactants (if any) with the ring method (see Annexe I). Surface tension values \n\nwere measured on the supernatant of the cultures with strains BBC|392 and BBC|398 on naphthalene, \n\nanthracene and phenanthrene. In addition, surface tension measurements in M9 medium with each of \n\nthe PAHs individually, M9 medium only and ultrapure water were also performed as controls (Figure \n\n13). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nS\nu\n\np\ne\n\nr\nf\nic\n\nia\nl \n\nT\ne\n\nn\ns\n\nio\nn\n\n (\nm\n\nN\n/m\n\n)\n\n6 3\n\n6 4\n\n6 5\n\n6 6\n\n6 7\n\n6 8\n\n6 9\n\n7 0\n\n7 1\n\n7 2\n\n7 3\n\nW a t e r\n\nM 9\n\nM 9  +  N A P\n\nB B C |3 9 2  +  N A P\n\nB B C |3 9 8  +  N A P\n\nM 9  +  A N T\n\nB B C |3 9 2  +  A N T\n\nB B C |3 9 8  +  A N T\n\nM 9  +  P H E\n\nB B C |3 9 2  +  P H E\n\nB B C |3 9 8  +  P H E\n\nFigure 13 Representation of the surface tension values of the supernatant resulting from the growth of \n\nthe BBC | 392 and BBC | 398 strains having naphthalene, anthracene or phenanthrene as the sole source \n\nof carbon. As controls, measurements were made in ultrapure water, M9 and M9 with PAHs. \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n\n \n\n In this study, M9 medium was used because it does not have intrinsic surfactant activity, \n\npresenting a surface tension (72.62 \u00b1 0.023 mN/m) very close to ultrapure water value (72.29 \u00b1 0.012 \n\nmN/m). There are some discrepancies between the values of surface tension of the water in contact with \n\nthe air in the literature. However, for the same determination method, the experimental value of the \n\nliterature for the surface tension of pure water at 25\u00b0C (72.00 \u00b1 0.10 mN/m) is coincident with the value \n\nobtained in this work (Kalov\u00e1 and Mare\u0161, 2015).  \n\nHowever, it can be realized that samples with M9 + PAH supernatant present lower surface \n\ntension values relative to the sample with only M9. This leads to the conclusion that the substrate \n\npresents some surfactant activity which reduces the surface tension. Therefore, the M9 + PAH samples \n\nshould be used as a negative control for the biological samples. \n\nIn the case of naphthalene, the strain BBC|392 shows a small decrease in surface tension (71.67 \n\n\u00b1 0.099 mN/m) relative to the M9 + NAP control (72.51 \u00b1 0.045 mN/m). The same does not occur for \n\nstrain BBC|398 (72.58 \u00b1 0.043 mN/m). \n\nThe most interesting results were obtained with anthracene, where strain BBC|392 exhibited a \n\nsubstantial reduction in surface tension (63.8 \u00b1 0.023 mN/m) compared to the M9 + ANT control (72.17 \n\n\u00b1 0.023 mN/m). The reduction presented by the strain BBC|398 is small (71.36 \u00b1 0.019 mN/m). \n\nAs for phenanthrene, strains BBC|392 and BBC|398 did not present any reduction of the surface \n\ntension in relation to the M9 + PHE control (72.26 \u00b1 0.012 mN/m). On the contrary, the value is slightly \n\nabove the value control (72.48 \u00b1 0.020 mN/m and 72.62 \u00b1 0.019 mN/m, respectively). \n\nStrain BBC|392 has proven to be the most promising in terms of biosurfactant production. \n\nHowever, according to the literature it is expected that microbial candidates for biosurfactant production \n\ndecrease the surface tension to around 35 mN/m (Banat, 1997). In this work, a reduction of superficial \n\ntension to 63.8 mN/m was reached, revealing the potential of biosurfactant production but not revealing \n\na relevant decrease. This low productivity may be due to the fact that after 15 days, the production of \n\nbiosurfactant is still in the initial stages, which reflects into a low concentration of the compound and \n\nconsequently a weak decrease of the surface tension. It is possible that the strain only produces the \n\nbiosurfactant in the presence of PAH to facilitate its solubilization and uptake, so the substrate acts as \n\ninducer of production. All biosurfactants are synthetized in the cytosol though ribosomal or non-\n\nribosomal peptide synthesis and specific biosynthetic enzyme activity, being after exported to the \n\nextracellular medium if applicable. Thus, the bacterial cell needs to activate genes and metabolic \n\npathways that lead to compound production. Besides, at each stage, intermediates or the final \n\ncompounds could have detrimental biophysical effect on the producing cell. The literature suggests that \n\nbiosurfactants produced by bacteria are considered strong if their surface tension ranges from 22 - 25 \n\nmN/m. The physicochemical nature of biosurfactants is considered as the main mechanism that limits \n\nthe production of stronger compounds, creating a selective pressure where the production of \n\nbiosurfactants considered stronger leads to unsustainable self-damage, being unfavourable genetically \n\nand phenotypically. For example, stronger biosurfactants may show increased ability to disrupt \n\nmembranes due to their phospholipidic nature. The production of stronger biosurfactants can also \n\nsolubilize or disrupt proteins or other macromolecules inside cells that could interrupt essential \n\nmetabolic pathways or secretion systems, and may even affect the production of the biosurfactant and \n\nthe accumulation of toxic products to the cell (Moldes et al., 2007). \n\nMoreover, there are a number of factors that affect the production of biosurfactants. The \n\nproduction of biosurfactants is a set of chemical reactions and consequently is affected by environmental \n\nfactors like pH, salinity and temperature. In addition, nutritional factors such as the carbon source - \n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\n \n\nchemical nature and quantity - also affect the process (Gakpe et al., 2007). Petroleum\u2013contaminated \n\nsites were identified to be good sources of hydrocarbons for induction of biosurfactant production by \n\nmicroorganisms (Chen et al., 2012). \n\nThe BBC|392 strain has been presumptively identified as belonging to the genus Acinetobatcer \n\nsp. This genus is described as containing biosurfactant producing species at sites hydrocarbons \n\ncontaminated sites (see Appendix C). For example, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus BU03 enhance the \n\nsolubility and biodegradation of phenanthrene (Zhao and Wong, 2009). This strain is reported as \n\nproducing an extracellular liposaccharide responsible for the formation of an emulsion (Kim et al., \n\n1997). Also Acinetobacter radioresistens KA53 produce another bioemulsifier complex designed alas \n\nan (Navon-Venezia et al., 1995). Recently, strains of Acinetobacter baumanii and Acinetobacter \n\nvariabilis, isolated from oil-contaminated soil, have been found to produce a rhamnolipid molecule, \n\nelucidating the true potential of oil refinery areas as sites for isolation of new non-pathogenic \n\nmicroorganisms capable of biosurfactant production (No and Ankulkar, 2017). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n44 \n\n \n\n3.4.3 Unravelling the degradative pathways of PAHs \n\n \n\nSearch for PAH catabolic genes \n \n\n In order to unveil the degradation pathways used by the selected strains - BBC|297, BBC|392, \n\nBBC|398 and BBC|652 - a PCR approach was applied targeting genes that encode enzymes for the \n\ncatabolism of PAHs. The results are shown in Figure 14. \n\n \n\n \n\nAccording to Figure 14, the gene encoding the initial dioxygenase enzyme (PAH ring \n\nhydroxylating dioxygenase, PAH-RDH) was only detected on strain BBC|652. \n\nIt would be expected that amplification would also occur for the strains belonging to the genus \n\nPseudomonas since the primers were constructed taking into account the different allele types present \n\nin the data base common to the Gram negative PAH degraders such as Pseudomonas, Ralstonia, \n\nCommamonas, Burkholderia, Sphingomonas, Alcaligenes and Polaromonas strains (C\u00e9bron et al., \n\n2008). Despite the gene coding for the enzyme dioxygenase had not been detected with these primers, \n\neven with optimization of PCR conditions, that does not mean that there is no enzyme coding region in \n\nthe genome of these strains. Rather, it is assumed that such a region must exist since strains are capable \n\nof degrading PAH and dioxygenase is essential to the process of activating PAH for catabolism in the \n\nupper catabolic pathway. The primers can then be non-specific for these microorganisms because they \n\nhave sequences that differ genetically from the remaining dioxygenase families. PAH-RDH are broadly \n\ndistributed across microbial taxa and one of the principal differences between families are the physical \n\ncharacteristics of the active site, which consequently affect the type and range of PAH substrates on \n\nwhich the enzyme will act and funnel to a productive catabolic lower pathway (Cravo-Laureau, 2017). \n\nDue to the divergence of lower metabolic pathways in the catabolism of PAH with the formation \n\nof catechol and/or gentisate intermediate metabolites from salicylate (Figure 1), different primers were \n\nused to allow their distinction. \n\nFigure 14 Photograph of the electrophoresis gel with the results of PCR amplification reactions whose targets \n\nwere PAHs catabolism genes. The red arrows highlight the amplified bands of interest. The 1Kb DNA ladder was \n\nused.  \n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n\n \n\nIn case of catechol synthesis, if the enzyme that acts on the molecule is the catechol 1,2-\n\ndioxygenase the cleavage is in the ortho position. Primers C12OF/R were reported as capable of \n\namplifying a region of the gene encoding the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (Sei et al., 1999). \n\nIf the enzyme to act on the catechol is the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase then the cleavage is in the \n\nmeta position. Primers C12OF/R have been described as capable of amplifying a region of the gene \n\nencoding the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (Sei et al., 1999). \n\nWhen gentisate is synthesized from salicylate, the enzyme involved is salicylate 5-hydroxylase. \n\nThe primer sgp319F/1238R targets a region of the gene coding for this hydroxylase (Izmalkova et al., \n\n2013). \n\nIn Figure 14 is shown a photograph of the electrophoresis gel highlighting the bands of interest \n\nthat amplified through the gene-targeted PCR. In Table 7 there is a summary of the metabolic pathways \n\nthat might be used by the selected strains according to these results. \n\nIt can be seen that for the primer targeting the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase there is only weak \n\namplification for the BBC|392 strain. It can be concluded that there is only evidence that this strain is \n\ncapable of following a degradation pathway involving a formation of the catechol from the salicylate \n\nfollowed by ortho cleaving of the catechol molecule with the formation of succinate and acetyl-CoA \n\nthat entered in tricarboxylic acid cycle. This enzyme belongs to the intradiol dioxygenase family that \n\nbreaks the aromatic ring between two adjacent hydroxyl groups of catechol. It is also possible to \n\nconclude about the possible localization of the gene since the genes for ortho cleavage are described as \n\nlocated on chromosome. Organization of genes differs in the gene order and operon distribution. For \n\nexample, for Acinetobacter calcoaceticus there are two enzymatic systems for degradation of catechol \n\nwhile for Pseudomonas putida there is only one enzymatic system coded apparently by different genes \n\n(Cravo-Laureau, 2017). A study showed that Acinetobacter sp. WSD completely degraded phenanthrene \n\nvia salicylate pathway instead of protocatechuate pathway (Shao et al., 2015). Although the BBC|392 \n\nstrain has only shown amplification for the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase enzyme, an Acinetobacter sp. \n\nstrain which metabolizes naphthalene and anthracene through catechol meta cleavage with the catechol \n\n2,3-dioxygenase enzyme was reported (Jiang, Qi and Zhang, 2018). Thus, it cannot be affirmed that \n\nBBC|392 only performs catechol ortho cleavage because it may be the primers that are non-specific for \n\nthe nucleotide sequence coding for the gene associated with the meta cleavage.  \n\nAbout the primers targeting the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase gene, there is amplification in strains \n\nBBC|297 and BBC|652, pointing out that these strains may follow a degradation pathway involving the \n\nsynthesis of catechol from salicylate with a meta cleavage of the catechol molecule with the formation \n\nof the metabolites acetaldehyde and pyruvate which also participate in the cycle of tricarboxylic acids. \n\nIt is also possible to conclude about the possible localization of the gene since the genes for meta \n\ncleavage are described as being organized on an operon composed by 13 genes located on a plasmid \n\n(Cravo-Laureau, 2017). Strain BBC|297 was presumptively identified has belonging to the genus \n\nPseudomonas. It is described that the meta pathway of catechol metabolism is induced during growth \n\non naphthalene or salicylate in different Pseudomonas spp. (Barnsley, 1976). In addition, ortho \n\npathways enzymes are also present in those strains. The authors suggest that separate regulatory systems \n\nfor the ortho and meta catechol pathways in Pseudomonads. However, in this work, only amplification \n\nfor the meta pathway was obtained, which does not invalidate the possibility of genes coding for ortho \n\npathway enzymes to exist but the non-specificity of the primer used does not allow amplification. \n\nBBC|652 was presumptively identified as belonging to the genus Paraburkholderia. Genus \n\nBurkholderia comprehends a large number of diverse species which include many important pathogens \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n\n \n\nas well as environmental species. Based on phylogenetic analyses, a division of the genus was proposed \n\nin 2014 where Burkholderia species contain clinically relevant and phytopathogenic species and \n\nParaburkholderia species are primarily environmental (Sawana, Adeolu and Gupta, 2014). In previous \n\nstudies, where the genus division was not yet applied, the genes encoding catechol 2,3-dioxygenase \n\nwere present in eight microorganisms belonging to Burkholderiaceae family, Burkholderia included, \n\ncontrasting with the genes encoding for catechol 1,2-dioxygenase which are observed in nearly all \n\nBurkholderiaceae (P\u00e9rez-Pantoja et al., 2012).  \n\nAs to primers targeting the salicylate 5-hydroxylase, amplification occurs also for strains \n\nBBC|297 and BBC|652 indicating that these strains have the genes required for degradation pathway \n\ninvolving the formation of gentisate from salicylate, which culminate in the opening of the aromatic ring \n\noriginating pyruvate and fumarate. The genus Pseudomonas, presumably identified as the genus of the \n\nBBC|297 strain, includes strains isolated from oil-contaminated soil which present genes that allow the \n\ndegradation of naphthalene via the gentisate pathway rather than the catechol pathway (Fuenmayor et \n\nal., 1998). As for the genus Burkholderia, presumably associated with strain BBC|652, it is also reported \n\nas capable of transforming salicylate via the gentisate pathway during the degradation of naphthalene \n\nand phenanthrene (Tittabutr et al., 2011). \n\nNote that it was not possible to conclude anything about possible degradation pathways of the \n\nBBC|398 strain since it did not show amplification with any of the primers, and although various \n\noptimization conditions were tested, no success was achieved. \n\nWith respect to plasticity in the use of metabolic pathways it can be concluded from Table 7 \n\nthat the BBC|297 and BBC|652 strains by having genes encoding enzymes belonging to different \n\ndegradation pathways are more adapted. However, it cannot be claimed that these are the only \n\ndegradation pathways used by the strains.  \n\nThe existence of appropriate biocatalytic systems, which requires that microorganisms contain \n\ngenetic information for the production of degradative enzymes is a first limiting factor for \n\nbiodegradation. If those enzymes are synthetized, the process will be determined by the environmental \n\nconditions. Analysis of PAHs catabolic genes in different bacterial genera can give valuable information \n\nabout the evolution of enzyme structure-function relationships and the evolution and diversity of \n\ncatabolic pathway genes via horizontal transfer, transposition events, DNA rearrangement, gene fusion \n\nand point mutation. In bioremediation, assessing the genetic information is crucial for monitoring \n\nbacterial populations that degrade PAHs in contaminated sites. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\n \n\nMonitoring of growth in intermediate metabolite phthalate \n \n\nPhthalate is a metabolic intermediate in the degradation pathways of anthracene and \n\nphenanthrene (Figure 1). A growth experiment was carried out with phthalate in order to understand if \n\nthe selected strains - BBC|297, BBC|392, BBC|398 and BBC|652 - are able to use it as a single carbon \n\nsource from the growth curves that are presented in Figure 15. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIt can be seen from the Figure 15 that strain BBC|652 is the only one that is clearly capable of \n\ndegrading and growing in phthalate. However, the viability values achieved are not very high since not \n\neven the increase of 1-log step is achieved. This strain was presumptively identified as belonging to the \n\ngenus Paraburkholderia. A strain of Burkholderia sp. was able to use 2-naphthanoate (a precursor \n\nmetabolite of phthalate) as sole carbon and energy source (Morawski et al., 1997). The features of this \n\npathway are convergent with those of phenanthrene with formation of phthalate and protocatechuate. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 15 Representation of the viability of the selected strains BBC|297, BBC|392, BBC|398 and BBC|652 over \n\n15 days growth having the metabolite intermediate phthalate as sole carbon source. In gray is depicted the abiotic \n\ncontrol where the respective strains have no carbon source. \n\nTable 7 Summary of the results obtained by searching for genes associated to the catabolism of PAHs by gene-\n\ntargeting PCR and monitoring the growth of the selected strains in a metabolic intermediate of PAH degradation.  \n\nThe filled circles indicate evidence of the strain being able to use the metabolic pathway.  \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n\n \n\nChapter III \u2013 Conclusion and Future Perspectives \n \n\nThis project intended to develop a novel bioaugmentation consortium from a sub-set of 47 \n\nevolved strains belonging to BBC collection throught selection, identification and metabolic/genetic \n\ncharacterization of best PAHs degraders (Figure 16). \n\nA preliminary interpretation of these results is present in this thesis but a more extensive analysis \n\nis required to establish the consortia. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 16 Overview of the work flow of this project. \n\n \n\nFrom the results obtained it is possible to conclude that the adaptive evolution experiments prior \n\nto this work were successful, since through the quantification by HPLC and the monitoring of cell \n\nviability by MPN a trend was clearly observed where the strains considered to be the best degraders \n\nbelonging to more recent cycles of adaptive evolution. \n\nThe PCA allowed the selection of three strains considered the best degraders considering their \n\ndistribution in the space formed by the PCs. It was observed in this distribution concordance with what \n\nwas found previously, standing out cycle 29 as the cycle of the best degraders. \n\nStrain BBC|392 belonging to the adaptive evolution cycle 29 showed the best location in PCA \n\nand was considered the most promising strain. However, by observation of growth curves, this was the \n\nstrain with the worst result, reaching the lowest viability values for all carbon sources. As the strain \n\ntends to form aggregates, which leads to uncertainty about how many cells are effectively in the initial \n\ninoculum, this can be a disadvantage for the preparation of a commercial inoculum for the consortium. \n\nThus, the discrepancies between the high initial screening results and the low viability results on growth \n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n\n \n\ncurves may be due to the fact that a different starting amount of inoculum was used. However, this strain \n\nhas the interesting property of apparently producing some biological molecule with surfactant activity, \n\nand the strains producing biosurfactants confer an advantage for the bioremediation because they more \n\neasily have access to the insoluble substrates. In addition, there is only evidence that the strain BBC|392 \n\nfollows the ortho cleavage of catechol as degradation pathway, which could in part justify the low \n\nviability results as it only follows a catabolic pathway compared to greater metabolic plasticity of other \n\nknown strains. The hypothesis is that the strain produces biosurfactants as an aid to its survival in places \n\nwhose only source of carbon is complex and in metabolic terms does not present the best efficiency. It \n\nwould be important to try to understand the chemical nature of the possible biosurfactant produced by \n\nthe strain through mass spectrometry, for example, in order to assess if it can have any interest. \n\nAs for the selected strain BBC|398, it also belongs to the adaptive evolution cycle 29. In relation \n\nto this strain, it has a degradative behaviour preferentially of using anthracene as carbon source which \n\nis coincident with de fact that it has previously been isolated in medium containing only this carbon \n\nsource. With respect to genes associated to the catabolism of PAHs, this strain remains an enigma since \n\nit did not show amplification with any of the tested primers. \n\nAnother of the selected strains was BBC|297, belonged to adaption evolution cycle 16 and was \n\nselected not only because it presents good viability results for naphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene \n\nbut also it was thought to be interesting to compare strains from different cycles. This strain turned out \n\nto be the most interesting one, since it exhibits a high degradative pattern for naphthalene, anthracene \n\nand phenanthrene. In addition, it presents metabolic plasticity in degradation pathways, and could follow \n\nthe catechol pathway (meta-cleavage) or the gentisate pathway. \n\nStudies were also carried out with strain BBC|652 which is not a strain from adaptive evolution \n\ntests but rather a microorganism detected as a contaminant but that exhibited interesting degradation \n\nbehaviour, especially for phenanthrene. The results obtained proved this because it was with this strain \n\nthat the highest values of growth in the presence of phenanthrene were verified. Regarding the \n\ndegradative pattern, there is clearly a trend towards the use of carbon sources. However, contrary to \n\nwhat is expected, the tendency is to more easily degrade the more complex carbon source and less easily \n\nthe simpler carbon sources. In addition, the strain BBC|652 was the strain that presented the most \n\npositive results for the amplification of the genes of interest, which means it has the most metabolic \n\nplasticity from all. It was possible to detect the presence of the initial dioxygenase essential for the \n\nactivation of the PAHs for degradation, with homologies with the dioxygenase of other bacterial genera \n\nknown to be PAH degraders. Moreover, it was possible to assume that the strain is capable of using the \n\ncatechol degradation pathway (meta-cleavage) and the gentisate degradation pathway. Remarkably, it \n\nwas the only strain able to grow using phthalate as the only source of carbon, indicating the presence of \n\ngenes and enzymatic machinery that enable phthalate degradation. This may be the reason why it has \n\nthe best results in phenanthrene. \n\nIn general, the existence of promising strains in metabolic and genetic terms that may be part of \n\nthe consortium has been proven. However, it would be important to carry out further studies that may \n\ngive more certainty regarding the degradative profile of the strains. What are the genes present in the \n\ngenome of these strains that allow the activation and degradation of PAHs? To access this information \n\nand the identification at species level, whole genome sequencing is an option. For the strains with \n\nmetabolic plasticity that could follow simultaneous degradation pathways, what are the degradation \n\npathways they actually adopt and in what conditions? Several strategies can be deployed as reverse \n\ntranscriptase-PCR, identification of metabolites thought mass spectrometry or kinetic tests to follow the \n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n\nmost relevant catabolic enzymes activity. In addition, it would be important to perform more growth \n\nstudies for a longer time (maybe months) to see if growth really is bi-phasic or not. \n\nFinally, for the consortium composed of strains BBC|297, BBC|392 and BBC|398, high viability \n\nvalues where observed what  may therefore have be considered a success. What strains were maintained \n\nover time? Is there a predominant strain? Would the addiction of strain BBC|652 increase the \n\ndegradation efficiency of the consortium? Also, considering that the consortium would be used in places \n\nwhere there is a mixture of PAHs and other compounds as well as several other microorganisms, it \n\nwould be of great importance to understand how these factors, among others (salinity, temperature, \n\nconcentration, for example) would affect the degrading behaviour of the consortium. Multiple \n\napproaches can be used to approximate the in vitro conditions of in situ conditions, mimicking the \n\nexpected microbial ecology at the contaminated sites. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n51 \n\n \n\nReferences \n \n\nAbdel-Shafy, H.
