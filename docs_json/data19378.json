The porous media is taken into poroelastic \n\nframework, in full-saturated condition, based on the Biot\u2019s Theory. A scalar damage model is \n\nassumed for this analysis. An implicit Boundary element Method (BEM) formulation, based \n\non time-independent fundamental solutions, is developed and implemented to couple the \n\nfluid flow and the elasto-damage problems. The integration over boundary elements is \n\nevaluated by using a numerical Gauss procedure. A semi-analytical scheme for the case of \n\ntriangular domain cells is followed to carry out the relevant domain integrals. The non-linear \n\nsystem is solved by a Newton-Raphson procedure. Numerical examples are presented, in \n\norder to validate the implemented formulation and to illustrate its efficiency. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Saturated Porous Media, Isotropic Damage, Boundary Element Method. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nRESUMO \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEste trabalho trata da an\u00e1lise num\u00e9rica de meios porosos saturados, considerando \n\ndanifica\u00e7\u00e3o na matriz s\u00f3lida.

OVERALL CONSIDERATIONS AND OBJECTIVES \n\nThe complexity of the problems currently encountered in engineering leads to a growing \n\ndemand for quality personnel, infrastructure and available analytical methods. In the field of \n\nstructural engineering, there have been several initiatives to improve the theoretical and \n\nnumerical representation of the behavior of structural parts and systems. The development of \n\nnumerical models enables a more realistic evaluation of the in-service behavior of structures \n\nand failure modes, quantifying the deterioration of components and determining the loading \n\nthreshold limits in projects. \n\nAmong the various topics of interest, the mechanical behavior of porous materials stands \n\nout. These are multiphase materials, composed of a deformable solid matrix and a porous \n\nspace, which may contain liquid and gas fluids. The interaction between the solid and fluid \n\nphases defines the mechanical response of the medium to the external forces, through solid \n\nskeleton deformations and the fluid flow into the pores. This thesis addresses the porous \n\nmedia fully saturated by a single fluid. \n\nThe study of porous materials is relevant in several areas, such as soil and rock mechanics, \n\ndiffusion of contaminants, biomechanics and petroleum engineering. \n\nThe cases in which a non-linear mechanical behavior of materials occurs, as for instance \n\ndamage and plasticity, are of great interest to the mechanics of materials and structures. The \n\nrupture process of a body is progressive, starting with a state of micro-cracking that localizes \n\nand develops into a state of effective crack opening, which can in fact induce rupture. The \n\nphenomenon identified between the onset of microcracking and fracture is called damage. \n\nThe damage models predict the gradual loss of strength and stiffness of the material when \n\nloaded. In its constitutive law, it exhibits regions in which resistant strain levels decrease with \n\nincreasing strain. Under a possible unloading condition, the stiffness loss remains constant, \n\nso that no residual strain accumulates. \n\nConsidering the increasing complexity of mechanical models developed for engineering \n\nproblems, the constant search for robust numerical formulations is vital, which can provide \n\nreliable results with the least possible computational effort. Thus in this context, the \n\nBoundary Element Method (BEM) is an interesting choice to obtain numerical solutions in \n\nvarious applications. \n\nThe behavior of a saturated porous medium is sought to be understood from the interaction \n\nbetween the mechanical response of the solid phase and the fluid flow through the porous \n\nspace. This work proposes to investigate the degradation of brittle and quasi-brittle materials \n\nfrom a known isotropic damage model. Thus, one of the objectives is to incorporate that \n\ndamage law into the solid matrix of the porous medium, in order to analyze the influence of \n\n\n\nPh.D. Thesis \u2013 Eduardo Toledo de Lima Junior 16 \n\n \n\nthe dissipative phenomena in the global response of the system, including it in the \n\nmechanical properties. The main objective of this thesis is the development of a nonlinear \n\nBEM formulation that enables the application of the aforementioned model. \n\n1.2. METHODOLOGY \n\nThe behavior of a saturated porous medium from the formulation presented in Coussy (2004) \n\nis described, which is derived from Biot\u2019s work (1941, 1955), taking as state variables the \n\nstrain in the solid matrix and the pore pressure acting on the fluid. A laminar fluid flow is \n\nassumed, which is governed by Darcy\u2019s law (1856). The Lagrangian kinematic description is \n\nadopted here. \n\nThe loss of stiffness from the damage process is assessed using an isotropic model, \n\napplicable to brittle and quasi-brittle materials, proposed by Marigo (1981). The scalar state \n\nvariable is introduced, which represents the deterioration level in the solid matrix. \n\nThe expression for the free energy potential of the poroelastic system is defined, with the \n\ninternal variables as the strain in the solid skeleton and the porosity. The damage scalar \n\nvariable is introduced into this expression, in order to incorporate the damage process to the \n\nproblem. \n\nA nonlinear transient BEM formulation is developed, by coupling the models of the method \n\napplied to the fluid diffusion and the plane elasticity in the presence of damage. The Betti\u2019s \n\nreciprocal theorem is used to obtain the integral equations, using time-independent \n\nfundamental solutions. The integration on the boundary elements is performed numerically, \n\nusing a Gauss-type procedure and a semi-analytical scheme is used to evaluate the domain \n\nintegrals of the problem. \n\nThe temporal integration of the constitutive equations is carried out implicitly. With the non-\n\nlinear damage law, the consistent tangent operator is deduced and the algebraic equilibrium \n\nequations are evaluated using the Newton-Raphson procedure. \n\n1.3. BRIEF LITERATURE REVIEW \n\n1.3.1. Poromechanics and Linear Poroelasticity \n\nThe first studies on the subject are credited to Terzaghi (1923), who described the \n\nmechanism for transferring an axial load applied to a soil column. This one-dimensional \n\nmodel did not foresee the occurrence of lateral strains. In 1936, Rendulic generalized \n\nTerzaghi\u2019s theory for a three-dimensional case. However, it was Biot (1941) who presented \n\nthe first well-accepted model for settlement, or consolidation, in three-dimensional media, \n\n\n\nChapter 1 - Introduction 17 \n\nconsidering isotropic and incompressible fluid.  Biot proposes the analysis of a porous \n\nmedium saturated by the superposition of two continuous media: the solid skeleton and the \n\nfluid phase that fills the pores. Biot (1955) later improved his own model by extending it to \n\ncompressible fluids, considering anisotropy for both the solid skeleton as well as for the fluid, \n\nformulating Darcy\u2019s law in a generalized way. \n\nSeveral studies emerged in the 1940s that proposed analytical solutions for particular \n\ngeometry problems and loading conditions. Biot and Clingan (1941, 1942), McNamee and \n\nGibson (1960, 1963), and Schiffman and Fungaroli (1965) can be cited. The behavior of \n\nunderground aquifers was studied in Verruijt (1969). Rice and Cleary (1976) sought to relate \n\nthe poroelastic parameters proposed by Biot, using concepts of soil and rock mechanics. In \n\nthis work the response differences of a saturated porous medium under drained and \n\nundrained conditions are discussed. \n\nAmong the more recent works, we highlight those developed by Coussy, presented in a book \n\nthat was published in 1995. In this publication, the poroelastic and poroplastic models are \n\ndescribed and justified by the rigorous consideration of thermodynamic effects involved. \n\nDetournay and Cheng (1993), Coussy et al. (1998), Wang (2000) and Coussy (2004) should \n\nare also mentioned. \n\nA study on saturated media, alternative to Biot\u2019s work (1941, 1955), was presented in \n\nAuriault and Sanchez-Palencia (1977). From the hypothesis, inherent in the homogenization \n\nschemes, that the microscopic structure is periodically reproduced in the domain of the \n\nproblem, the authors proposed a model for a media saturated by a viscous and \n\nincompressible fluid. Other authors have explored the theme from this micromechanical \n\napproach, citing Chateau and Dormieux (1998) that addressed partially saturated media, and \n\nLydzba and Shao (2000) that examined the role of microstructure to define the material \n\nproperties. \n\n1.3.2. Strain Localization and Continuum Damage Mechanics \n\nKachanov (1958) was the first work that introduced the concept of damage. This work \n\ninvestigated a problem of uniaxial creep for metals subjected to high temperatures, and the \n\ndamage variable was introduced to describe the ability of a cross section to transfer a \n\nload. The continuum damage mechanics (CDM) was formalized based on the \n\nthermodynamics of irreversible processes, in the works of Lemaitre and Chaboche (1985) \n\nand Lemaitre (1992). In thermodynamics, a consistent physical meaning emerges for the \n\nvariables that describe the material degradation, always associating them to an energetic \n\nprocess. \n\n\n\nPh.D. Thesis \u2013 Eduardo Toledo de Lima Junior 18 \n\n \n\nMaterials that exhibit softening behavior are subject to the problem of strain localization. \n\nFrom a mathematical point of view, this phenomenon leads to some drawbacks regarding the \n\nexistence and uniqueness of a solution to the problem. The topic was addressed in Benallal \n\net al. (1991). Comi et al. (1995) presented a study on the strain localization for pure \n\ncompression in brittle materials (concrete).  The different influences of the formulation of \n\nelasto-plastic damage model on the compression localization are analyzed. Pijaudier-Cabot \n\nand Benallal (1993) described the localization conditions for a material following a non-local \n\ndamage constitutive relationship. Theoretical studies on localization are also found in \n\nBenallal et al. (1992) and Jir\u00e1sek (2002). \n\nThe traditional damage models, formulated under local theory, do not capture the effects \n\nintroduced by the strain localization phenomenon. Thus, some strategies were proposed to \n\nregularize the solutions obtained with these local models, based on the concept of a \n\ncharacteristic length for each material. It is assumed that this length limits the range that is \n\nsubject to localization. \n\nMore robust nonlocal damage theories have also been presented. Bazant (1991) argued, \n\nbased on micromechanics concepts, that at a certain point the damage can be assessed by \n\nweighting the deformations measured in the vicinity of this point. Pijaudier-Cabot and Bazant \n\n(1987) discuss, regarding a simplified damage model, the influence of a non-local variable \n\ncalculated as an integral over a representative volume of the same variable defined \n\nlocally. The same authors in Baznt and Pijaudier-Cabot (1988) present the same non-local \n\nintegral, stating that other quantities should be considered besides the deformation, as for \n\ninstance the damage measure. \n\n1.3.3. Porous Media Subjected to Damage \n\nMany authors have addressed the effects of micro-cracking and damage in porous media. As \n\nin damage models for solids, there are energy approaches (CDM) based on thermodynamic \n\nprinciples and micromechanical approaches, which usually rely on homogenization \n\nprocesses to express the properties of the material at a macroscopic scale. Some works that \n\nuse both methods are mentioned, in addition to experimental studies. \n\nCheng and Dusseault (1993) proposed a model based on CDM and on Darcy\u2019s law, and a \n\ndamage evolution law from microscopic and macroscopic experimental results on \n\nrocks. Bary\u2019s thesis (1996), on the study of concrete dams, presents an anisotropic damage \n\nmodel based on thermodynamics, and also a numerical analysis using finite elements, with \n\nan experimental calibration of material parameters. Shao et al. (1999) and Bart et al. (2000) \n\npresent a damage variable defined in terms of the density of distributed microcracks, using \n\n\n\nChapter 1 - Introduction 19 \n\nfracture mechanics results to assess the damage evolution. The expressions that measure \n\nthe influence of damage on the material properties are also presented. \n\nSouley et al. (2001) experimentally measured the permeability changes induced by damage \n\non sandstones, incorporating these findings into an anisotropic damage model. Numerical \n\nanalyses related to the experiments of Souley et al. (2001) are presented in Rutqvist \n\n(2009). Other experimental analyses on the occurrence of damage in porous media and the \n\nconsequent alteration of its mechanical and hydraulic properties are found in Tang et al. \n\n(2002) and Ghabezloo et al. (2009). \n\nA viscoelastic model for the stable and unstable damage evolution is presented and \n\nvalidated, based on laboratory results of tests conducted on granite and sandstone, by \n\nHamiel et al. (2006). Dormieux and Kondo (2004) analyzed changes in the permeability of a \n\nsaturated medium from a self-consistent homogenization scheme. A critical value of \n\nmicrofissuration density parameter is defined, besides verifying a sudden increase in the \n\npermeability coefficient. Dormieux et al. (2006) studied the evolution of anisotropic damage \n\nin saturated media, also from a micromechanical point of view. Another model regarding \n\ndamage evolution that considers anisotropy is found in Zhou (2006). \n\nA mixed model of anisotropic damage, based on energy principles and micromechanics \n\nresults is presented in Arson (2009) and Arson and Gatmiri (2009), with applications on \n\npartially saturated media, considering temperature effects. \n\n1.3.4. Integral Equations and BEM Applied to Poroelasticity and to Damage Mechanics \n\nStudies on integral equations are known to exist since the early nineteenth century, which \n\nare the basis for the Boundary Element Methods. However, the first classical theory of \n\nintegral equations, in which the kernels were defined and integrable, is credited to Fredholm \n\n(1903). Fredholm (1906) was a pioneer in the solution of boundary value problems in \n\nelastostatics using the linear integral formulation. From this work, the use of integral \n\nequations remained limited to theoretical formulations with an indirect approach. In these, the \n\nsolution to the problem was obtained by fictitious sources applied to the contour, which after \n\nits determination, allowed calculating the physical variables of the problem. In 1967, Rizzo \n\npresented the first direct formulation for the numerical treatment of integral equations, in \n\nwhich the kernels contain the variables of the problem.  \n\nBased on the technique presented by Rizzo (1967), several authors addressed the problem, \n\nciting the works of Cruse (1969, 1973, 1974) that addressed the general problems of two and \n\nthree-dimensional elasticity, and Rizzo and Shippy (1968 ) that proposed to introduce sub-\n\nregions in the treatment of non-homogeneous areas. \n\n\n\nPh.D. Thesis \u2013 Eduardo Toledo de Lima Junior 20 \n\n \n\nThe so-called boundary methods made headway after Lachat\u2019s thesis, submitted to the \n\nUniversity of Southampton in 1975, in which the author introduced the simplicity and \n\nelegance the method lacked, bestowing upon it a greater generality. With Lachat\u2019s \n\ndevelopments, the techniques for solving integral equations were then interpreted as a \n\nnumerical method. It is reported that Brebbia (1978a, 1978b) was the first to refer to the \n\ntechnique as \u201cBoundary Element Method\u201d in his works. In these studies, obtaining the \n\nintegral equations was performed by using the Weighted Residual Method, with the \n\nappropriate choice of the weighting function. After the first book, published by Brebbia \n\n(1978a), the method began to be studied intensively in several research centers. \n\nTelles and Brebbia (1979, 1980a, 1980b) showed BEM being used in elastic and viscoplastic \n\nproblems, with the introduction of strain or stress fields in the equation. Venturini (1982, \n\n1984, 1988) and Venturini and Brebbia (1983, 1988) applied the Boundary Element Method \n\nto geotechnical problems, including in the modeling of materials with discontinuities. \n\nIn the field of porous media, Cleary (1977) can be cited as a pioneering work, presenting the \n\nfirst integral equations for poroelasticity, based on the direct formulation, proposed by Rizzo \n\n(1967). Time-dependent fundamental solutions for soil consolidation were presented in \n\nAramaki and Yasuhara (1981) and Kuroki et al. (1982). In 1984a, Cheng and Liggett \n\nformulated an integral equation for poroelasticity applying the Laplace transform. The authors \n\nincorporated the propagation of cracks to the problem in Cheng and Liggett (1984b). \n\nAlso in the 1980s and 1990s, there were other important works on the application of direct \n\nBEM formulations to the problem of poroelasticity, citing Cheng and Predeleanu (1987), \n\nNishimura and Kobayashi (1989), Dargush and Banerjee (1989, 1991) and Borba (1992). A \n\nmore complete treatise on the fundamental solutions and integral equations for the \n\nporoelastic problem was presented by Cheng and Detournay (1998). \n\nLater, Park and Banerjee (2002) analyzed the three-dimensional problem of soils \n\nconsolidation by developing particular integrals. Cavalcanti and Telles (2003) presented time \n\nindependent fundamental solutions applied to the analysis of saturated media.  As for works \n\nthat address poroplasticity, Wutzow (2008) can be cited, which incorporated stiffeners into \n\nthe solid matrix. Kamalian et al. (2008) and Maghoul et al. (2010) present fundamental \n\nsolutions in time domain for media under saturated and unsaturated conditions. \n\nAmong the earliest known BEM formulations for the analysis of damage mechanics \n\nproblems, Herding and Kuhn (1996), Garcia et al. (1999), Lin et al. (2002) and Sladek et \n\nal. (2003) are cited. Also cited are Botta et al. (2005), Venturini and Botta (2005) and Benallal \n\net al. (2006). Several of these works incorporate strategies to deal with numerical instabilities \n\nassociated with the problem of strain localization. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 - Introduction 21 \n\nSome studies on numerical analysis of porous media subject to damage, based on the Finite \n\nElement Method, should be cited.  A damage evolution law for geomaterials was proposed in \n\nCheng and Dusseault (1993). Selvadurai (2003) incorporated isotropic damage to saturated \n\nporous media, presenting empirical expressions for permeability variation due to damage \n\nprocess. Selvadurai and Shirazi (2004) addressed the problem of a spherical cavity filled with \n\nfluid. Vasconcelos (2007) incorporated an isotropic damage formulation to a FEM code \n\napplied to saturated geomaterials. \n\nThe solution to nonlinear problems from the Newton-Raphson method and the resulting use \n\nof consistent tangent operators is widespread in the scientific community and can be found in \n\nSimo and Taylor (1985) and Simo and Hughes (1992). Other works that address BEM \n\nversions for non-linear models are: Bonnet and Mukherjee (1996), Poon et al. (1998), Fudoli \n\n(1999) and Benallal et al. (2002). \n\n1.4. THESIS STRUCTURE \n\nThe items discussed in this thesis are arranged throughout the text as described below: \n\nChapter 2 presents a brief review of the poromechanics, showing how the heterogeneous \n\nmedium is described, and also the problem formulation, which is based on the classical \n\ncontinuum mechanics. The continuum damage mechanics is considered briefly and the local \n\ndamage model adopted in this work is presented. The strain localization phenomenon is \n\ncommented and, although not addressed in this thesis, a non-local model able to deal with \n\nthe problem is presented. \n\nChapter 3 presents the model developed for the damage on the solid matrix of the saturated \n\nporous media. Expressions to evaluate the influence of the damage process on the \n\nmechanical and flow properties of the material are proposed. There are some aspects of the \n\nboundary element method, and the nonlinear formulation of the method developed for the \n\ncomputational implementation of the model is presented. The algorithm of damage evolution \n\nis described, and also the deduction of the consistent tangent matrix is shown. \n\nChapter 4 presents some numerical applications in order to validate the model and illustrate \n\nthe operation of the code developed. \n\nThe equations in the text of the thesis are written in indicial or tensorial notation, using the \n\none that is more illustrative, depending on the context in which it is inserted. Some equations \n\nare presented in both notations, when deemed necessary. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 2 \n\nAspects on Poromechanics and \n\nContinuum Damage Mechanics \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Aspects on The Poromechanics and The Continuum Damage Mechanics 23 \n\n 2.1. OVERALL CONSIDERATIONS  \n\nThe mechanics of porous media addresses materials whose mechanical behavior is \n\nsignificantly influenced by the presence of fluid phases. The response of the material is \n\ndefined through its deformations when subject to external actions and pressure changes in \n\nthe fluid. In rocks, for example, two mechanisms have a core importance in this interaction \n\nprocess between the phases (Detournay and Cheng, 1993): An increase in the pore \n\npressure induces the rock to dilate, whereas a compression in the rock results in increased \n\npore pressure, in the case of confined fluid. Considering the non-confinement, the excess \n\npore pressure, which is imposed by the compression of the rock, is gradually dissipated \n\nduring the fluid diffusion process and a new deformation distribution is created in the \n\nbody. Thus, it is observed that the rock is more deformable in drained conditions. \n\nA basic idea to be considered in the study of porous media is that their response to certain \n\nexternal actions is not immediate. The deformations occur over time in the phenomenon \n\nknown as settlement or consolidation. The observations and the need to explain this \n\nphenomenon propel further studies on porous media. \n\nThe damage mechanics predicts the loss of strength and stiffness of a solid, due to \n\nirreversible microscopic processes, such as: decohesion, relative slipping of crystal structure, \n\nphase changes, etc. Some of these processes are caused by existing microdefects or \n\nmicrocracks in the material, which provide a microstrain concentration in its neighbourhood. \n\nThis chapter presents a brief description of poromechanics, mostly based on the works of \n\nCoussy (2004) and Wang (2008). Assuming that the solid matrix is subject to a damage \n\nprocess, some comments are made about the mechanics of continuous damage, specifying \n\nhow it is considered in the mathematical formulation. For additional details, Lemaitre and \n\nChaboche (1985) and Voyiadjis and Kattan (2005) can be referenced. \n\n2.2. DESCRIPTION OF A SATURATED POROUS MEDIUM \n\nLet us assume a porous medium, composed of a solid matrix, and a porous space in which \n\nthe pores are interconnected. It is through this connected porous space that the transport of \n\nfluid mass occurs.  Any two points in its domain can be connected by a generic arc totally \n\ncontained in it, so that the fluid phase in that space can be treated as a continuum. There \n\nmay also be closed pores included in the solid matrix, in which the occurrence of flow is not \n\nconsidered, at least not in the timescale considered in this theory. Hence, from this point of \n\nthe text, the term \u201cpore\u201d is applied to the effective pores of the connected space, while the \n\ndisconnected pores will be treated as part of the solid matrix. \n\n\n\nPh.D. Thesis \u2013 Eduardo Toledo de Lima Junior 24 \n\n \n\nTherefore, it is understood that the saturated porous medium is described by the \n\nsuperposition, temporal and spatial, of two continuous media: The first represents the solid \n\nskeleton and the second, the fluid phase. Usually, the deformation of the porous media is \n\ndescribed in relation to the skeleton deformation, which can actually be observed and shows \n\na more accessible physical meaning. \n\nAn infinitesimal volume of porous medium can be represented by the composition of two \n\nelementary material particles (Figure 2.1), one that is solid \u2013 which also contains occlusions \n\nand disconnected pores \u2013 and one that is fluid. Considering that the porous medium is \n\nheterogeneous at a microscopic level, its treatment as a continuous medium requires the \n\nchoice of a macroscopic scale, in which the internal constitution of the material can be \n\nneglected, when analyzing the physical phenomenon of interest. Therefore, the continuity \n\nhypothesis admits the existence of an infinitesimal control volume of representative \n\ndimensions at a macroscopic scale, in the study of all phenomena involved in the intended \n\napplication. \n\n \nFigure 2.1 \u2013 Definition of the porous medium by the superposition of the fluid and solid phases \n\n2.3. BEHAVIOR OF THE SKELETON \n\nIf there are external forces or pressure variations in the fluid, the solid skeleton deforms.  \n\nThis deformation is analyzed according to the classical theory foreseen in the continuum \n\nmechanics, whose main concepts are briefly described below. \n\n2.3.1. Motion of a Continuum. Displacement. Deformation Gradient  \n\nConsider a solid body occupying a determined region of space, at a time t 0? . In this initial \n\nconfiguration, a particle is represented by its position vector X  of components iX , in a \n\nCartesian coordinate system, of orthonormal basis ie  (i 1, 2, 3)? . After deforming, in time t , \n\nthe body is in a current configuration, with its reference particle represented by the position \n\nvector x  of components i jx (X , t)  as shown in Figure 2.2. One can then write: \n\nskeleton particle fluid particle\ninfinitesimal volume\nof porous medium\n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Aspects on The Poromechanics and The Continuum Damage Mechanics 25 \n\ni i i j iX e  ; x (X , t)e? ?X x  (2.1) \n\nthe displacement vector u of a particle is defined, from its initial position X  to the current \n\nposition x  as: \n\n?x X + u  (2.2) \n\nSupposing two particles, positions X  and dX + X  in the initial configuration.  After the \n\ndeformation, the infinitesimal material vector dX  becomes dx , and connects the two \n\nparticles in their current positions x  and dx + x .  Any vector material dX  is transported to its \n\ncorresponding deformed dx  by a linear application called the deformation gradient F , as \n\nfollows. \n\nd d? ?x F X  (2.3) \n\ni\nX ij\n\nj\n\nx\n ; F\n\nX\n\n?\n? ? ?\n\n?\nF x  (2.4) \n\n \nFigure 2.2 - Initial and current configurations \n\nNote that the operator refers X?  to the initial configuration.

A continuum deformation can be described \n\nin two ways. The first one, called Eulerian or spatial, takes the current position of a particle \n\nas reference, expressing the variables depending on x  and t . In the Lagrangian, or material \n\ndescription, the particles are described as a function of the initial position X  and time t . \n\n2.3.2. Porosity. Void Ratio \n\nLet an infinitesimal volume td?  of the porous medium, written in the current \n\nconfiguration. The volume occupied by the fluid phase equals tdn ? , with n  the Eulerian \n\nporosity. Considering that this reference volume changes with deformation, the Eulerian \n\nporosity is not well suited to quantify the volume variation withstood by the pore space. \n\nTherefore, the Lagrangian porosity ?  is defined, which deals with the current porous volume \n\nin relation to the initial volume 0d? . \n\n0 t d  dn? ? ? ?  (2.7) \n\nIn order to quantify the degree of compactness of a porous material, an Eulerian variable is \n\ndefined, the void ratio e . This is the relationship between the porous volume and the solid \n\nmatrix volume: \n\n1\n\nn\ne\n\nn\n?\n\n?\n (2.8) \n\n2.3.3. Strain Tensor \n\nDuring the deformation, the infinitesimal vectors in the deformed configuration undergo \n\nchanges in their lengths and angles. These changes can be measured by the Green-\n\nLagrange strain tensor, identified by ? . Take two vectors dX  and dY , taken in dx  and dy  \n\nafter deformation, respectively.

BEHAVIOR OF THE FLUID PHASE  \n\nIn the development of constitutive equations for a porous medium, the description of the fluid \n\nmotion in relation to the initial configuration of the skeleton is necessary. \n\n2.4.1. Particle Derivative  \n\nAs aforementioned in the previous section, the description of the skeleton\u2019s deformation can \n\nbe done as a function of time t  and the position vector X , both referenced in the initial \n\nconfiguration of the particle. In this Lagrangian description, the skeleton\u2019s strain kinematics is \n\nformulated by the derivatives in total time. \n\nIn some cases, it may be of interest to formulate the problem according to an Eulerian \n\ndescription, taking into account only the current configuration of the skeleton at a given time \n\ninstant. In this type of approximation, it is necessary to define a velocity field ( t)?V x,  of the \n\nparticle, which can be either a fluid particle or a skeleton particle (indicated by f? ?  or s? ?\n, respectively). The particle derivative concept is shown below. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Aspects on The Poromechanics and The Continuum Damage Mechanics 29 \n\nIn a multiphase domain, the derivatives of any field defined for any domain can be taken in \n\nrelation to one of the phases, separately. In the case of a porous medium, derivatives can be \n\ntaken with respect to the skeleton or the fluid. d dt??  is defined as a particle time derivative \n\nof the field ?  related to the particle  ?

Lagrangian Continuity Equations   \n\nThe representation of the fluid mass balance for a Lagrangian description is now \n\ndescribed.

The \n\nequation shows that the mass remains constant and equal to its value in the initial \n\nconfiguration. \n\nEquations (2.41) and (2.43) are the Lagrangian formulation, alternatives to the Eulerian \n\nequations of continuity, given in (2.35) and (2.36). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Aspects on The Poromechanics and The Continuum Damage Mechanics 33 \n\n2.6. MOMENTUM BALANCE \n\nNow we formulate the momentum balance for a porous medium, still according to the \n\nhypothesis adopted in the preceding paragraphs, which is treated as a superposition of two \n\ncontinuous media, interacting with each other. The momentum balance concept is important \n\nto obtain the total stress tensors. \n\n2.6.1. The Hypothesis of Local Forces \n\nAny material domain t?  can be subject to two types of external forces: the body forces and \n\nthe surface forces. Generally, the body forces solicit the skeleton and the fluid in the same \n\nway. This is the case, for example, of forces due to gravity. An infinitesimal force ?f  acting \n\non the elementary volume td? is defined by a volume force density per unit mass f : \n\nt( , t)d? ? ?f f x??  (2.44) \n\nThe density of the porous medium ? , which includes the matrix and fluid phase, is given by: \n\n? ?s f1? ? ?? ? ?n n  (2.45) \n\nIt is assumed that the body force density f  depends only on the current position of particle x\n\n, and time t. Then, the effects caused by the external body forces are assimilated the same \n\nway by infinitesimal and total domains td?  and t? . These body forces are local \n\nforces. Here the non-local body forces, the ones depending on the distance between \n\nparticles, for instance, are not considered. \n\nThe surface forces act on the boundary t??  of the domain t? . Similarly to what was \n\ndescribed for the volume forces, we can define an infinitesimal surface force ?T through its \n\ndensity T , as follows: \n\n( , t, )da? ?T T x n  (2.46) \n\nNote that T  also depends on n ,  the outward unit normal to the surface da , at the point \n\ndefined by x . It is assumed that the effects of surface forces acting on an infinitesimal region \n\nof  t??  are noticeable in the vicinity of this restricted area. The hypothesis that surface \n\nforces have a local nature is known as Cauchy\u2019s hypothesis. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPh.D. Thesis \u2013 Eduardo Toledo de Lima Junior 34 \n\n \n\n2.6.2. Momentum Balance \n\nIn a given porous domain t? , it follows that the result of all forces must be equal to the rate \n\nof change of the linear momentum balance, that is:  \n\n? ? ? ?\nt t t t\n\ns f\ns f\n\ns t f t t\nd d\n\n1  d  d , t  d ( , t, ) da\ndt dt\n\n? ? ? ??\n\n? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ? ?V V f x T x nn n? ? ?  (2.47) \n\nThe terms ? ? ss t1  d? ? ?Vn  and \nf\n\nf td? ?Vn  represent the amount of linear momentum \n\nbalance respectively related to the particles of the skeleton and the fluid contained in td? . It \n\nis considered that the external forces act on all the matter contained in t? , without any \n\ndistinction between fluid and skeleton. Note the role of particle derivatives d dt? , which \n\nincorporate the effects of the different motions of the solid and fluid particles in the change of \n\nthe global momentum balance. \n\nSimilarly, we can write the angular momentum balance: \n\n? ?\n\n? ?\nt t\n\nt t\n\ns f\ns f\n\ns t f t\n\nt\n\nd d\n1  d  d\n\ndt dt\n\n, t  d ( , t, ) da\n\n? ?\n\n? ??\n\n? ? ? ? ? ?\n\n? ? ? ? ?\n\n? ?\n\n? ?\n\nx V x V\n\nx f x x T x n\n\n? ?\n\n?\n\nn n\n\n (2.48) \n\n2.6.3. The Dynamic Theorem \n\nThe inertial forces generated in the volume td?  may be related to the external forces ?f  \n\nand ?T, acting in it. Taking the particle derivatives in (2.47), and using the definitions (2.21), \n(2.25), (2.33) and (2.34), the following is written: \n\n? ?? ? ? ?\nt t t\n\ns f\ns f t t1 d , t  d ( , t, ) da\n\n? ? ??\n\n? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ?? ? ?n n f x T x n? ?  (2.49) \n\nThe integrand on the left represents the inertial force related to the material contained in td?\n\nin a current time t . \n\nThe expression (2.49), also called theorem of the dynamic resultant, is valid for any domain \n\nt? , considering the hypothesis of local forces, which ensures that a body force ( , t)f x  acting \n\non volume td?  is independent of choosing domain t? , which contains it. \n\nThe moments due to inertial forces also correspond with the moments of external forces, so \n\nthat we can equate a theorem similar to (2.49), starting from equation (2.48): \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Aspects on The Poromechanics and The Continuum Damage Mechanics 35 \n\n? ?? ? ? ?\nt t t\n\ns f\ns f t t1 d , t  d ( , t, ) da\n\n? ? ??\n\n? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ?? ? ?x x f x x T x nn n? ?

Let \n\nus assume an infinitesimal tetrahedron (Figure 2.4), whose three sides jdS  \nare parallel to \n\nthe plans coordinated and guided by j?e . The surfaces jdS  are related to the surface base \n\narea dS  of the normal n : \n\nj j jdS dS e dSn? ? ?n  (2.51) \n\nApplying the theorem (2.49) to the tetrahedron, the following is obtained: \n\n? ?? ?s fs f j j\ni 1 3\n\nhS\nO 1 ( )dS ( e )dS\n\n3\n? ? ?\n\n?\n\n? ? ? ? ??f T n T\n?\n\n?n n? ?

EQUILIBRIUM EQUATION \n\nThe equation of motion of the elementary volume td?  can be obtained from the theorem \n\n(2.49), in which the definition given in (2.55) is introduced, obtaining: \n\n? ?? ?\nt t\n\ns f\ns f t1 d  da 0\n\n? ??\n\n? ? ? ? ? ?? ?f n?? ? ? ?n n? ?

PARTIAL STRESS TENSOR \n\nThe tensor ?  includes the stress related to the skeleton and the fluid, without any \n\ndistinction.

ASPECTS ON THE CONTINUUM DAMAGE MECHANICS \n\nThe rupture process of a body is progressive, starting with a microcracking state that \n\nlocalizes and develops into a state of effective opening of cracks, which can in fact induce to \n\nrupture. The phenomenon identified between the onset of micro-cracking and cracking is \n\ncalled damage. \n\nThus, the damage theory is no longer valid to the effective crack opening, a state described \n\nby fracture mechanics. According to Janson and Hult (1977) apud Proen\u00e7a (2001), one can \n\ndifferentiate the two theories as follows: \n\n- In damage mechanics the strength of a loaded structure is determined by the evolution of a \n\ndefect field (microcracks or microvoids) considered continuously distributed; \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Aspects on The Poromechanics and The Continuum Damage Mechanics 39 \n\n- In the fracture mechanics, the strength of a loaded structure is determined by the evolution \n\nof a single defect, such as a pre-defined oriented crack in a sound medium. \n\nIn the continuum damage mechanics, the damage assessment is conducted by checking the \n\nstrength or stiffness decrease in the solid. This is because one cannot directly quantify the \n\ndamage, but can measure the damage undergone by their overall mechanical properties. \n\n2.10.1. Damage Variable and Effective Stress  \n\nConsider a damaged solid body, from which an infinitesimal volume is isolated. Let  dS  be \n\nthe surface area of this volume defined by the normal n . The microcracks and voids in this \n\nsection occupy an area ddS .  Then, the effective resistant area is \nddS dS dS? ? . The \n\nrepresentative damage variable is defined by: \n\nd\n\nn\ndS\n\ndS\n?D  (2.71) \n\nFrom a physical point of view, the damage variable  nD  is the relative value of the damaged \n\nsection area, cut by a plane normal to n . \n\nNote that by assuming isotropy, the variable has a scalar nature D . \n\nLet ?  be the stress normal to the surface dS  in the presence of any normal force \napplied. The resistant area of the section can be written as \n\nddS dS dS dS(1 D)? ? ? ?  (2.72) \n\nwhich allows to define the effective portion of the stress: \n\nef dS\n\n1 DdS\n\n?\n? ? ? ?\n\n?\n (2.73) \n\nIn the case of isotropic damage, the effective stress concept can be extended to two-\n\ndimensional and three-dimensional problems, where it is valid to write the tensor ef? . \n\nThe effective stress concept is common to both the study of porous media and the study of \n\ndamaged solid media. It represents the stress portion that effectively acts on the solid \n\nskeleton, excluding the stress portions associated with the fluid pore pressure (2.68), and \n\nwith the dissipative damage process. This partition of the total stress tensor will become \n\nclearer in the presentation of the constitutive equations of the coupled problem, in the \n\nfollowing chapter. \n\n \n\n\n\nPh.D. Thesis \u2013 Eduardo Toledo de Lima Junior 40 \n\n \n\n2.10.2. Isotropic Local Damage Model (Marigo, 1981) \n\nLet us assume the free energy associated with a solid, written as: \n\n? ?jk jklm jk lm\n1\n\n( , D) 1 D E\n2\n\n? ? ? ? ? ??  (2.74) \n\nwith jk?  and jklmE  the strain and elastic tensors of the intact material, respectively. The mass \n\ndensity is indicated by ? . Let D  be the only internal scalar damage variable. It is \n\nunderstood that  D  assesses the state of degradation of the material, taking values between \n\nzero and one. The variable D  that is null indicates intact material, while the unit value is \n\nassociated with complete degradation. \n\nOne should note the correspondence between this energy expression and equation (3.1), \n\nwhich represents the free energy potential associated with the saturated porous \n\nmedium. Equation (2.74) shows only the dissipation portion related to the strain tensor in a \n\nsolid, penalized by the damage variable.  \n\nThe derivatives of the energy potential with respect to the state variables jk?  and D  lead to \n\ndefine the associated variables, which are the total stress \n\n? ?jk jklm lm\njk\n\n1\n1 D E\n\n2\n\n??\n? ? ? ? ?\n\n??\n?

This is induced by the damage process. Depending on the material\u2019s constitutive \n\nmodel, this softening can also cause a loss of stiffness in the system. This is the case of the \n\ncontinuous damage models. \n\nThe localization phenomenon occurs in materials that undergo softening, and is \n\ncharacterized by large discontinuities in the strain field. Small localized regions of the body \n\ndissipate more energy, hence showing much greater strain values than those measured in \n\nother parts of the body. The onset of localization can be caused by geometric imperfections, \n\nby the presence of heterogeneities of the material, by boundary conditions or by loading \n\nconditions. \n\nMathematically, the ellipticity loss of the local equilibrium equations indicates the occurrence \n\nof strain localization. Thus, the boundary value problem becomes ill-posed, leading to the \n\nloss of solution uniqueness. \n\nTo avoid this problem, one can resort to the concept of the material\u2019s characteristic \n\nlength. Some non-local damage theories take this concept into account. One of them is \n\nbriefly described here. \n\nThe strategy presented here is based on the concept of non-local integral proposed by \n\nPijaudier-Cabot and Bazant (1987), which consists in considering a non-local thermodynamic \n\nforce Y . The value of the force Y  is weighted with a function defined over the whole domain \n\n?  or in part of it, evaluated in the neighbourhood of the point of interest. This function ?Y  \n\nhas a radial character, depending on the distance between the base point s  and the mapped \n\npoint q. The non-local force is defined by the integral: \n\n? ?1(s) s q (q) dq\n(s)\n\n?\n\n? ? ?? YY YV  (2.79) \n\nwhere (s)V  is \n\n? ?(s) s q  dq\n?\n\n? ? ?? YV  (2.80) \n\nThe following weight function is chosen, for example: \n\n? ?\n2\n\ns q\ns q exp\n\n2\n\n? ??\n? ?? ? ?\n? ?\n? ?\n\nY 2l\n (2.81) \n\n\n\nPh.D. Thesis \u2013 Eduardo Toledo de Lima Junior 42 \n\n \n\nWith l  as the characteristic length of the material. It is seen that, in the condition 0?l  the \nweight function tends to the Dirac distribution (s q)? ? , which refers to the local model. The \n\nfunction takes higher values as the points s  and q approximate each other, and tends to \n\nlower values for points further away from each other. \n\nThe damage criterion is rewritten as ( , D) (D)? ??F Y Y , and the evolution law results: \n\nD\nY\n\nA\n\n?\n\n??  (2.82) \n\nNote that the stresses are still calculated locally, according to (2.75).

OVERALL CONSIDERATIONS \n\nThe concepts of poromechanics and continuum damage mechanics presented herein enable \n\ndeveloping a formulation for poroelasticity taking into account damage in the solid matrix, a \n\nbehavior that from this point of the text will be identified as poro-damage. The coupled \n\nproblem is defined from the free energy potential in the system, from which the constitutive \n\nequations are obtained. The field equations, which complement the formulation, are those \n\nalready defined in the previous chapter. \n\nThe damage process of the skeleton induces changes in the mechanical properties of the \n\nporous material. This chapter presents the expressions for the evolution of these parameters \n\naccording to the deterioration level on the skeleton. \n\nGiven the difficulties in obtaining analytical solutions for modeling problems in general, the \n\nso-called numerical methods emerge, based on approximate solutions calculated at discrete \n\npoints in the domain under analysis. Among the known methods, the boundary element \n\nmethod appears as a good alternative to obtain numerical answers to several problems. \n\nThe integral formulation of the coupled model is written, and the corresponding nonlinear \n\nBEM formulation is then developed, enabling the computational implementation of the \n\nreferred model. \n\n3.2. PORO-DAMAGE FORMULATION \n\nLet us assume a poroelastic system, under quasi-static linear regime. The description of the \n\nmechanical behavior of this system requires the following set of equations: \n\n- Constitutive laws for porous solid and for the fluid \n\n- Balance equation of the porous medium \n\n- Fluid continuity equation  \n\n- Fluid transport law \n\nThe consideration of the damage process in the poroelastic system incurs changes at two \n\npoints of the aforementioned equations. The constitutive law that governs the solid considers \n\nthe gradual degradation undergone by the material, through the stress part associated with \n\nthe damage, which leads to changes in the porous medium equilibrium. \n\n3.2.1. Constitutive Laws \n\nLet us assume the free energy potential per unit volume of a saturated porous medium \n\nsubject to damage, written as: \n\n\n\nPh.D. Thesis \u2013 Eduardo Toledo de Lima Junior 46 \n\n \n \n\n? ?\n\n? ? ? ? ? ?\n\n2\ndr 2\n\nkj 0 kj kjlm lm kj\n\n2\n0 0 kj\n\n1 1\n(? , , D) (1- D)? : E : ?

In saturated condition, the Lagrangian porosity ?  measures the \n\nvariation of fluid content, that is, the variation of fluid volume per unit volume of porous \n\nmedium.  The mass density of the porous medium is described by ? . The tensor kj?  \n\ncontains the solid skeleton strains. The internal damage variable, represented by D , \n\nassesses the deterioration state of the material, taking values between zero and one. The \n\nnull variable D  indicates sound material, while the unit value is associated with complete \n\ndegradation.  \n\ndr\nkjlmE  represents the isotropic elastic tensor of the material under drained conditions, defined \n\nby:  \n\ndr dr\nkjlm kj lm kjlm\n\n2G\nE K 2G\n\n3\n? ?? ? ? ? ?? ?\n? ?\n\nI  (3.2) \n\nThe bulk modulus drK  and the shear modulus G  refer to the drained material and can be \n\nobtained experimentally. The fourth order identity tensor is represented by kjlmI . It can be \n\nobserved that one of the possible sets of parameters for the characterization of porous \n\nmaterial is formed by M , b , \ndrK  and G . \n\nThe derivatives of the energy potential (3.1) with respect to the internal variables of the \n\nsystem, kj? , ?  and D  give rise to its conjugate pairs, in other words, they define the \n\nassociated variables, which are the total stress kj? , pore pressure p  and the thermodynamic \n\nforce associated with damage Y : \n\n? ? ? ?drkj kjlm lm kj 0 kj\nkj\n\n(1 D)E ?

Thus, the terms in \n\nbrackets can be interpreted as the evolution of the variable along the loading process. \n\nSubstituting  (3.4) in (3.3), we arrive at the following expression:   \n\n? ?dr dkj kjlm lm kjlm lm 0 kjE DE p p? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? b  (3.6) \n\nin which it can be seen that the total stress tensor is composed of three parts. The first one \n\ndepends on the elastic properties of the solid phase, called effective stress. The second, also \n\nrelated to the solid, includes the non-linear effects of the damage process. The last part is \n\nrelated to pore pressure p . Note that the p  values are taken with a positive value, by \n\nconvention. Then, equation (3.6) can be expressed as:  \n\n? ?ef dkj kj kj 0 kjp pb? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  (3.7) \n\nwith dkj?  as the stress part associated with damage. \n\nIt can be seen that the pore pressure affects only the hydrostatic components of the total \n\nstress. It is known that at any point of a fluid, the pressure measured has a normal \n\ncomponent, with the same value in all directions, and a tangential component, related to \n\nviscosity. For non-viscous fluid, an accepted condition in this work, that tangential part is \n\nneglected. \n\nWith the stress and strain tensors, the material parameters under undrained condition, \n\nexpressed by 0?? , are also defined. The undrained bulk modulus uK  and the Skempton \n\ncoefficient B  are: \n\n? ?\n? ?\n\n? ?\n\nkju\n\nkj\n0\n\nkj\n0\n\nTr1\n\n3 Tr\n\np\n3\n\nTr\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n? ?\n? ? ?\n\n? ?\n\n?\n? ?\n\n? ?\nB\n\n (3.8) \n\nIt is found that uK  relates the volumetric strain with the hydrostatic stress, while B  relates \n\nthis stress to the pore pressure p . \n\nThese parameters can be related to the ones defined in drained condition, as follows: \n\n\n\nPh.D. Thesis \u2013 Eduardo Toledo de Lima Junior 48 \n\n \n \n\n? ?\n\nu dr\n\nu\n\n22 u\n\nu dr\n\n? ??\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n? ??\n\nb\nB\n\nB\nM\n\n (3.9) \n\n3.2.2. Fluid Transport Law  \n\nThe transport of a fluid in an interstitial space is described by a flow law, derived from the \n\nfluid dissipation equation. Let us consider the dissipation equation below: \n\n? ?f x f fp ?? ? ?? ? ? ?? ?? ?f ? ?  (3.10) \n\nOverall, it is written as: \n\nf? ? ?? ?  (3.11) \n\n? ?f s x f f( ) ; p ?? ? ? ?? ? ?V V fn? ? ?  (3.12) \n\nwith ?  as the vector that represents the filtration - as defined in 2.4.2 \u2013 and ?  the force that \n\ninduces the filtration. Assuming a laminar flow of the fluid through the porous space, a linear \n\nrelationship between the two quantities can be considered. Darcy\u2019s Law, in its linear classic \n\nversion, uses the permeability tensor k : \n\n? ?f s x f f( ) p? ? ?? ? ?? ?? ?n V V k f? ?  (3.13) \n\nwhich is defined by \n\n?\n?\n\nk\nk\n\n (3.14) \n\ndue to the intrinsic permeability of the skeleton k  and to the fluid viscosity ? . In the case of \n\npartially saturated domains, there is also the influence of relative permeability corresponding \n\nto each fluid phase in this value. Note that this coefficient is taken as the scalar k?k  in this \n\nstudy, on account of the admitted isotropy. In a more general law, it is necessary to use the \n\nanisotropic permeability tensor. \n\nIn this work, we will use a Lagrangian description of the variables. In the Lagrangian \n\ndescription, the flow and filtration vectors result as: \n\nf s\nf  ; ( )? ? ? ?? ?M V V? ? ?lag lag  (3.15) \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Poro-Damage Formulation and BEM Implementation 49 \n\n \n\nDarcy\u2019s linear Law, which relates the pore-pressure gradient and relative velocity of the fluid \n\nin relation to the skeleton, is written as: \n\n? ?f s x f f( ) k p? ? ?? ? ?? ?? ?V V f? ? ?

Fluid Continuity Equation \n\nThe lagrangian fluid continuity equation, neglecting a possible source of fluid is written as: \n\nf\nx\n\nd\n0\n\ndt\n?? ? ?\n\nm\nM  (3.18) \n\nApplying the definition f f?m ? ?  and equation (3.15), another form is admitted for equation \n\n(3.18): \n\n? ? ? ?f f k ,k\nd\n\n0\ndt\n\n? ?\n?? ? ?  (3.19) \n\nThe fluid mass density depends on the pressure and temperature. Considering an isothermal \n\nprocess, there is only the influence of pressure, which can be represented by f f fK\np\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n, \n\nwith the bulk modulus of the fluid represented by fK . The derivatives in (3.19) lead to the \n\nequation: \n\n? ?fk,k k ,kK p p? ?? ? ? ? ? ?? ?  (3.20) \n\nInserting Darcy\u2019s Law definition into equation (3.20), an function in terms of pore-pressure p  \n\nis obtained: \n\n? ?f 2k,k ,k k ,kK p k p pf? ?? ?? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ?? ?  (3.21) \n\nThe consideration of fK  introduces a nonlinearity into the problem, associated with the term \n\n2\n,kp . In the equation (3.21) this parameter is not taken into account. However, the fluid \n\ncompressibility is implicitly (or partially) considered, using fK  in the calculation for the \n\nmechanical properties of the material. \n\n\n\nPh.D. Thesis \u2013 Eduardo Toledo de Lima Junior 50 \n\n \n \n\n3.2.4.

(3.22) \nFrom this point of the text, a simple notation will be used to represent the volume forces \n\nacting on the porous medium, with no distinction between forces in the fluid or solid phase. \n\nThis is to achieve greater clarity in the exposition of the integral formulations of the problem. \n\nTherefore, we have the equilibrium written due to tensor b , as follows. \n\nx kj, j k0 ; b 0? ? ? ? ? ? ?b?

INFLUENCE OF DAMAGE ON THE POROELASTIC PARAMETERS \n\nThe damage process evolution can be measured through the gradual deterioration in the \n\nmechanical properties of the solid skeleton. Thus, the mechanical parameters of the porous \n\nmaterial, dependent on the parameters of the solid matrix, also undergo the influence of the \n\ndamage. The Biot coefficient of the effective stress is defined by \n\ndr\n\ns\n\nK\n1\n\nK\n? ?b  (3.28) \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Poro-Damage Formulation and BEM Implementation 51 \n\n \n\nwith sK  as the bulk modulus of the solid constituent, with a value that is higher than the \n\nmodulus drK . This latter is calculated with the values of modulus G  and Poisson\u2019s ratio ? \n\nmeasured under a drained condition:  \n\ndr 2G(1 )K\n3(1 2 )\n\n? ?\n?\n\n? ?\n (3.29) \n\nIntroducing the damage effect directly on the drained modulus, one obtains \n\ndr dr2G(1 )K (D) (1 D) (1 D)K\n3(1 2 )\n\n? ?\n? ? ? ?\n\n? ?\n (3.30) \n\nwhich can be applied over time in expression (3.28). The Biot modulus M  is calculated \n\nusing the expression:  \n\nu dr\n\n2\n\nK K?\n?M\n\nb\n (3.31) \n\nwhich can also be written with the damaged values. An expression to calculate the undrained \n\nmodulus can be defined based on its drained equivalent (Detournay and Cheng, 1993): \n\nu\nu\n\nu\n\n2G(1 )\nK\n\n3(1 2 )\n\n? ?\n?\n\n? ?\n (3.32) \n\nin which Poisson\u2019s undrained ratio \nu?  is determined experimentally.  \n\n3.4. ASPECTS ON THE BOUNDARY ELEMENT METHOD \n\nThe numerical methods are alternatives for the mathematical solutions to study engineering \n\nproblems. The latter are usually limited by difficulties in obtaining analytical solutions to more \n\nor less complex problems that include general geometries and non-linear behaviors. \n\nOne of the areas in engineering research is the development of suitable numerical methods \n\nto solve these problems. In the case of this work, the numerical method to be used is the \n\nboundary element method. This method applies, as the weighting function, an analytical \n\nsolution of a problem that is similar to that which is sought to be resolved, but with particular \n\nboundary conditions. This function is called a fundamental solution. \n\nWhen the physical properties of the domain, for which the fundamental solution was \n\ncalculated, correspond exactly to the properties of the domain analyzed, it is not necessary \n\nto use any domain discretization. This usually occurs for linear problems. However, when \n\n\n\nPh.D. Thesis \u2013 Eduardo Toledo de Lima Junior 52 \n\n \n \n\nthere is some limitation in the fundamental solution, the domain discretization to consider the \n\nresidual quantities is then necessary.  \n\nNevertheless, the fact that many of the unknown variables, usually the most important, \n\nbelong exclusively to the boundary, the mesh density used in the domain is considerably \n\nreduced when compared to the domain methods, as for instance the finite element method. \n\nThis section provides, in general, some principles of the method. The symbols used herein \n\ndo not retain any correspondence with the variables already defined in previous chapters. \n\n3.4.1. Boundary Elements and Discretization \n\nConsidering the integral formulation of a problem, written for the boundary points, its \n\ntreatment depends on the clear description of this boundary. The main objective of BEM is, \n\nbased on the integral formulation, the assembly of an algebraic system, which allows to \n\ndirectly determine the approximate boundary values and, from these, the other values of \n\ninterest for the analysis. Clearly, there are endless possible equations to be written, since the \n\nintegral formulation can be applied to the infinite points of the boundary of the domain or to \n\nthe external points. \n\nThe equivalent representation of the boundary, in a finite dimension, is done by defining the \n\nnodes that delimit the so-called boundary elements. This boundary parametrization can \n\nresult as exact or approximate, depending on the domain geometry under analysis and the \n\ntype of parameterization used. Figure 3.1 illustrates the two situations, using linear elements. \n\nBesides the geometric characterization of the element, the variables of interest to the \n\nproblem must be evaluated from a finite number of values associated with the discretization \n\nnodes. It is common to use polynomial functions to interpolate the variables along the \n\nboundary elements, that is, between the discretization nodes. \n\n \nFigure 3.1 \u2013 Exact and approximate boundary discretizations  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Poro-Damage Formulation and BEM Implementation 53 \n\n \n\nThe shape functions to approximate the boundary geometry and the variables involved can \n\nbe chosen freely, depending on the type of problem studied and the required accuracy of the \n\nresults. The combination of two equal interpolation functions gives rise to the isoparametric \n\nelement. In this study, the linear isoparametric element is used, as illustrated below. \n\n \nFigure 3.2 \u2013 Linear isoparametric element  \n\nIn which 1?  and 2?  are the functions that compose the linear distribution f ( )? , defined on \n\nthe local dimensionless coordinate [0,1]? ? .

In such cases, one can apply the discontinuous element \n\nconcept (Figure 3.3), together with the definition of double nodes, which are nodes with the \n\nsame coordinates, but with different associated values. In order to write two different \n\nequations for these nodes, the collocation point is moved along the element axis, at a \n\ndistance corresponding to 1/4 of its length, as suggested in Venturini (1988). \n\n \nFigure 3.3 \u2013 Discontinuous adjacent elements, with double node; Interpolation functions in a \n\ndiscontinuous element \n\n3.4.2. Domain Discretization \n\nAs will be seen in this section, the integrals over the domain, which are in the proposed \n\nformulation, can be subdivided into two basic classes. In the first one, the kernel, which \n\nconsists of a fundamental solution or its derivatives, multiplies a term of known value over \n\nthe domain (3.38), as in the case of body force integrals. Another situation is that in which \n\nthe term multiplied is a system unknown, as in equation (3.39).

BEM FORMULATION \n\nUsing the boundary element method requires developing the integral formulation of the \n\nproblem in question. Also, it is necessary to define the fundamental solutions for the \n\nvariables involved. \n\nAs already stated, the poroelastic system can be described by superposition of the fluid and \n\nsolid phases. Thus, in the formulation there are equations related to the fluid pore-pressure, \n\nas well as the ones from elasto-damage problem, to which terms that reflect the effect of \n\npore-pressures are incorporated. Thus, there is a set of integral equations that represent the \n\ncoupling between the mechanical behaviors of the phases. \n\nWe seek herein to present the integral equations for both the solid and fluid phases. \n\n3.5.1. Integral Formulation for the Solid Phase \n\nFundamental Solutions. To characterize the fundamental problem, an infinite domain \n*?  is \n\nconsidered subject to a unit force acting at point s  (source point), in the direction i . The point \n\nwhere the effects due to that force are measured is called the field point and is represented \n\nby q . In order to represent the unit force of the fundamental problem, we consider the term \n\nkb (q) , from the equilibrium equation of elastostatics ef kkj, j b 0? ? ? , as a Dirac delta \n\ndistribution, weighted by a Kronnecker delta that establishes the directions i  and k , as \n\nfollows: \n\n\n\nPh.D. Thesis \u2013 Eduardo Toledo de Lima Junior 58 \n\n \n \n\n ik ikb (q) (s, q)? ? ?

All the quantities in the \n\ntext referring to the fundamental state are indicated with an asterisk ( * ). \n\nHooke\u2019s Law, which is the constitutive relationship for only the solid phase, relates the strain \n\ntensor with the effective stress, as follows: \n\nef\nkj kjlm lm kj mm kj\n\n2G\n(q) E (q) (q) 2G (q)\n\n(1 2 )\n\n?\n? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n\n? ?\n  (3.58) \n\nFrom the strain-displacement relation, Hooke\u2019s Law is written in terms of displacements. \n\nDifferentiating it with respect to jx , we obtain the first term of the equilibrium equation (3.57), \n\nwhich results as: \n\nij,kj\n\n* *\nik, jj ik\n\n1 1\nu (s, q) u (s, q) (s, q) 0\n\n1 2 G\n? ? ? ? ?\n\n? ?\n (3.59) \n\nin which \n*u (s, q)  represents the displacement field in the fundamental state. \n\nThe solution to equation (3.59), for the two-dimensional case is \n\n*\nik ik i ,k\n\n1\nu (s, q) (3 4 ) ln(r) r r\n\n8 (1 )G\n? ?? ? ? ? ? ?? ?? ??\n\n (3.60) \n\nwith r  as the distance between the source and field points s  and q , respectively. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Poro-Damage Formulation and BEM Implementation 59 \n\n \n\nDifferentiating equation (3.60) with respect to jx , and using the strain-displacement relation, \n\nwe obtain the strain tensor in the fundamental problem: \n\n*\nijk ,k ij , j ik ,i jk ,i , j ,k\n\n1\n(s, q) (1 2 )(r r ) r 2r r r\n\n8 (1 )Gr\n? ?? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ?? ??\n\n (3.61) \n\nFrom Hooke\u2019s law, the fundamentals effective stresses can be written as follows: \n\nef *\nijk ,k ij , j ik ,i jk ,i , j ,k\n\n1\n(s, q) (1 2 )(r r r ) 2r r r\n\n4 (1 )r\n? ?? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ?? ??\n\n (3.62) \n\nAlso of interest is the fundamental solution for a Traction defined by the normal ? , on a point \n\nQ  of the boundary.

The \n\ntheorem is based on the principle of energy conservation and defines that for a solid volume \n\nV  between any two states, exists the relationship: \n\n1 2 1 2\nV V\n\n(q) (q)dV (q) (q)dV? ? ? ? ?? ?  (3.69) \n\nIt should be noted that for applying the principles of reciprocity, such as Betti\u2019s one, it is \n\nnecessary that the two fields involved keep a linear and proportional relationship between \n\nthem. Therefore, the theorem will be written in terms of effective stress, which is linear and \n\nproportional to the strain tensor. \n\nThus, let us assume a finite domain ? , delimited by the boundary ? , which represents the \n\nbody under analysis, inserted in an infinite medium *? . Consider the existence of two loads, \n\nwith one of them acting in region ? , corresponding to the real problem.

The equation is written in terms of \n\nthe rates of the variables involved, which should be evaluated over time t , by an incremental \n\nschema in terms of t? . Due to the presence of the correction terms associated with damage, \n\nthe equation is non-linear at each increment t? . Thus, it is used an incremental-iterative \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Poro-Damage Formulation and BEM Implementation 73 \n\n \n\nsolution procedure, based on a Newton-Raphson technique.

OVERALL CONSIDERATIONS \n\nThis chapter presents some applications for the formulations developed and implemented \n\ncomputationally. First, some examples on poroelasticity and elasticity with damage are \n\nexamined in order to validate the implementation carried out for the uncoupled problems. \n\nSection 4.4 addresses the coupled problem, which is the objective of this work. It should be \n\nmentioned that this formulation was implemented in FORTRAN\u00ae. \n\n4.2. LINEAR POROELASTICITY EXAMPLES  \n\nThe poroelastic model implemented in this work is applied to the analysis of classical \n\nproblems of soil and rock mechanics with known analytical solution, in order to validate its \n\noperation. A verification of the model response under different loading conditions is also \n\nconducted.  \n\n4.2.1. One-dimensional Consolidation \n\nLet us consider the classic problem of one-dimensional consolidation proposed by Terzaghi, \n\nwhich consists of a soil column on a rigid impermeable base (Figure 4.1). A constant \n\nheaviside-type unit load is applied to the upper drainage surface and maintained for 100 s. \n\nTake a column of 10 m in height, consisting of Berea sandstone, completely saturated by \n\nwater. The material parameters are defined in Detournay and Cheng (1993). The \n\ndiscretization of the problem includes 44 boundary elements and 40 domain cells. \n\n \nFigure 4.1 - Problem definition, adopted cells mesh \n\nFrom Figure 4.2, we can observe that the response at the initial times is characterized by the \n\nhighest pore-pressure values, indicating that the fluid phase is highly requested, while the \n\n10 m\n\n1 m\n\ndraining surface\n\n\n\nPh.D. Thesis \u2013 Eduardo Toledo de Lima Junior 80 \n\n \n\nsolid skeleton does not undergo all the loading action. Throughout the fluid draining process \n\nthere is an increased level of effective stress, accompanied by a proportional pore-pressure \n\ndecrease, until it vanishes at 100 s. \n\nTable 4.1 - Parameters of the Berea sandstone \n\nParameter Value\nG  6000 MPa \n? 0.2 \n\nu?  0.33 \n\nsK  36000 MPa \n\n0?  0.19 \nk  1.9 x 10-13 m2 \n? 1 x 10-9 MPa.s \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.2 - Pore-pressures and vertical effective stress at 0.1 s; 1s; 5s; 10s; 20s; 50s; 100s \n\nFigure 4.3 shows the pore-pressure values at the base of the column over time.

(1969), in terms \n\nof an adjusted time factor, and of the dimensionless values of pore-pressure and total and \n\neffective stresses in both coordinate directions: \n\nf\n\n(1 ) 2Gk\nt\n\n(1 2 )\n\n?\n?\n\n? ?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n           \n\np( )\np\n\np(0)\n\n?\n?\n\n           \n\n11 22\n\n11 22\n\n( ) ( ))\n\n(0) (0))\n\n? ??? ? ?\n? ?\n\n?? ? ?\n           \n\nef ef\nef 11 22\n\nef ef\n11 22\n\n( ) ( ))\n\n( ) ( ))\n\n? ??? ??\n? ?\n\n?? ? ?? ?\n \n\n \nFigure 4.9 - Problem definition, adopted cells mesh \n\n0,096\n\n0,098\n\n0,1\n\n0,102\n\n0,104\n\n0,106\n\n0,108\n\n0,11\n\n0,112\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\np\no\n\nre\n-p\n\nre\ns\ns\nu\nre\n\nref erence 1x1 1x2 1x3 1x5 2x3 2x5\n\ndraining surface\n\n10 a\n\n10 a\n\nx2\n\nx1\nO\n\n\n\nPh.D. Thesis \u2013 Eduardo Toledo de Lima Junior 84 \n\n \n\nThese dimensionless values, measured at point O (0,a/2), are shown in Figure 4.10. The \n\nresults obtained with the proposed model are compared with those calculated analytically. As \n\nin the case of one-dimensional consolidation, the initial slow flow of the fluid induces the \n\nlargest pore-pressure, while the solid skeleton did not yet undergo significant strain. \n\nAlso during the early-time response, the occurrence of the Mandel-Cryer effect (Mandel, \n\n1950, 1953; Cryer, 1963) apud Schiffman et al. (1969) should be noted, characterized by an \n\nincreased pore-pressure level, over the initial value. At this stage, the areas next to the \n\nsurface are quickly drained, undergoing increase in the strain fields and effective stresses. \n\n \nFigure 4.10 - Dimensionless values of pore-pressure, total and effective stress \n\nThe volumetric reduction due to this quasi-instantaneous consolidation induces an additional \n\ncompression in the most inner regions of the body, which then develops additional pore-\n\npressures in the saturating fluid. The effect in question manifests itself at point O (0,a/2), \n\nsince this is distant from the draining face. During the drainage process, the dissipation of \n\npore-pressure gives rise to increased levels of effective stress, as shown in Figure 4.12. \n\nThe normalized values of total and effective stress in the horizontal direction, defined by,\n\n11\n11\n\n11\n\n( )\n\n(0)\n\n??\n? ?\n\n?\n \nand \n\nef\nef 11\n11 ef\n\n11\n\n( )\n\n(0)\n\n??\n? ?\n\n?\n, are also defined in the reference analytical solution for the \n\npoint O (0,a/2).

In order to illustrate the distribution of these variables on the domain over time, take \n\nhypothetical values for some input parameters of the problem, as follows: \n\nTable 4.2 - Hypothetical parameters adopted in example 4.2.2 \n\nParameter Value\na 1 m \nG  0.5 MPa \n? 0 \nb  1 \nM 100 \n\nk  1 \n \n\nIt is assumed that the load has a unit value. The boundary mesh is refined, now containing \n\n136 elements, in order to get a better view of the quantities shown in Figure 4.12. The \n\ndrainage process is well defined by the equilibrium between pore-pressures and effective \n\nstresses on the domain. The loading effects are manifested within a limited area, adjacent to \n\nit, in accordance with the Saint-Venant principle. \n\nNote that the pore-pressure levels tend to remain close to zero in the region close to the \n\ndraining surface, in agreement with the pore-pressure concept placed here, which is related \n\nto the differential pressure value compared to the ambient pressure. \n\nThe poroelasticity formulation is not very sensitive to the time step adopted. Choosing \n\nsmaller increments only depends on the interest in quantifying the variables in the initial \n\nanalysis times. This confirms the fact that the poroelastic problem can be interpreted as a \n\nusual elastic problem, to which additional stiffness and damping are incorporated due to the \n\npresence of the fluid phase. \n\n\n\nPh.D. Thesis \u2013 Eduardo Toledo de Lima Junior 86 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.12 - Evolution of pore-pressure and vertical effective stresse at 0.001s; 0.01s; 0.2s; 2s; 100s \n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n-1\n\n-0.95\n\n-0.9\n\n-0.85\n\n-0.8\n\n-0.75\n\n-0.7\n\n-0.65\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.55\n\n-0.5\n\n-0.45\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.35\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.25\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.15\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.05\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\n0.45\n\n0.5\n\n0.55\n\n0.6\n\n0.65\n\n0.7\n\n0.75\n\n0.8\n\n0.85\n\n0.9\n\n0.95\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\npore-pressure effective stress\n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Numerical Examples 87 \n\n4.2.3. Poroelastic Response under Different Loading Conditions \n\nUsually, the problems on poroelasticity are characterized by applying an instantaneous \n\nloading, with heaviside-type distribution (Figure 4.13). Thus, it is possible to reproduce a \n\ncondition that does not allow pore-pressure dissipation during the loading process. \n\nConsider a monotonic loading condition, uniformly distributed over a time interval, as \n\nillustrated in Figure 4.13. \n\n \nFigure 4.13 - Loading profiles \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.14 - Response at the base of the column for the instantaneous and monotonical loading over \n\n1s, 10s and 100s - a) pore-pressure as a function of vertical strain b) pore-pressure evolution   c) \n\nvertical effective stress evolution. \n\n0\n\n0,2\n\n0,4\n\n0,6\n\n0,8\n\n1\n\n1,2\n\n1,4\n\n-1 0 1 2 3\n\nlo\na\n\nd\n\ntime\n\nheaviside\n\nmonotonic\n\n0\n0,05\n0,1\n\n0,15\n0,2\n\n0,25\n0,3\n\n0,35\n0,4\n\n0,45\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\np\no\nre\n?p\nre\nss\nu\nre\n\u00a0(\nM\nP\na\n)\n\ntime\u00a0(s)\n\nheaviside 1s 10s 100s\n\n0\n0,05\n0,1\n\n0,15\n0,2\n\n0,25\n0,3\n\n0,35\n0,4\n\n0,45\n\n?0,00007 ?0,00006 ?0,00005 ?0,00004 ?0,00003 ?0,00002 ?0,00001 0\n\np\no\nre\n?p\nre\nss\nu\nre\n\u00a0(\nM\nP\na\n)\n\nstrain\n\nheaviside 1s 10s 100s\n\n?1,2\n\n?1\n\n?0,8\n\n?0,6\n\n?0,4\n\n?0,2\n\n0\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\ne\nff\ne\nct\niv\ne\n\u00a0s\ntr\ne\nss\n\u00a0(\nM\nP\na\n)\n\ntime\u00a0(s)\n\nheaviside 1s 10s 100s\n\n\n\nPh.D. Thesis \u2013 Eduardo Toledo de Lima Junior 88 \n\n \n\nThe problem of poroelastic column is taken up with a load applied over 1 s, 10 s and 100 s, \n\nwhich is the total time of analysis. According to section 4.2.1, under the instantaneous \n\nloading condition, this time is sufficient to dissipate the pore-pressures and for the effective \n\nstress to reach its final value, equal to the total stress applied, over the entire domain. Figure \n\n4.14 shows the responses for the different loading application times, compared with the \n\ninstantaneous application case, at a point at the base of the column. \n\nFor the non-instantaneous loadings, the initial values of pore-pressure and effective stress \n\nare zero. For loading cases over 1 to 10 s, these values evolve over time, tending to the \n\nresponse for instantaneous loading. However, this is not true for the load distributed over the \n\ntotal time of 100s. In this situation, at the end of the loading process, the drainage is not yet \n\ncompleted, therefore there is residual pore-pressure along the column height, and the \n\neffective stress levels have not reached the value of the applied load, as shown in Figure \n\n4.15. However, if the load is kept constant from 100 s on in this monotonic case, the pore-\n\npressure will fall to zero as for the other cases. \n\n \nFigure 4.15 - Pore-pressure and effective stress at the end of 100s \n\n4.3.

Characterization and Parametric Analysis of the Model \n\nAs presented in Chapter 2, Marigo\u2019s model (1981) represents the behavior of a brittle or \n\nquasi-brittle material in the elastic regime subject to damage. The damage criterion is defined \n\nby two constants dependent on the material, with a scalar-valued variable that represents the \n\ndegradation level. Moreover, the model is symmetric with respect to the type of solicitation, \n\nproviding the same answer to each strain level, whether it is tensile or compressive. \n\nIn order to describe the model, let us consider a hypothetical material with a unit longitudinal \n\nmodulus of elasticity and nil Poisson\u2019s coefficient. The damage parameters are taken with \n\nthe values Y0=0.05 and A=0.3. Imposing any loading, which induces an evolution of strain at \n\na point, the predicted constitutive answer for the damage model is presented in Figure 4.16. \n\n \nFigure 4.16 - Characteristic curve of the damage constitutive law  \n\nThe first branch, with linear behavior, corresponds to the elastic regime, in which the total \n\nstresses are equal to the effective stresses, and the stresses for the damage are nil. Once \n\nthe damage process begins, these damage stresses start to evolve, reaching the peak value, \n\ncorresponding to the state of complete degradation, where D=1. Figure 4.17 illustrates the \n\nevolution of the damage variable. \n\n \nFigure 4.17 - Damage variable evolution  \n\n0\n\n0,1\n\n0,2\n\n0,3\n\n0,4\n\n0,5\n\n0,6\n\n0,7\n\n0,8\n\n0,9\n\n0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1\n\nst\nre\n\nss\n (\n\nM\nP\n\na\n)\n\nstrain\n\ntotal stress\n\ndamage stress\n\n0\n\n0,2\n\n0,4\n\n0,6\n\n0,8\n\n1\n\n1,2\n\n0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1\n\nd\na\n\nm\na\n\ng\ne\n\n p\na\n\nra\nm\n\ne\nte\n\nr\n\nstrain\n\n\n\nPh.D. Thesis \u2013 Eduardo Toledo de Lima Junior 90 \n\n \n\nBased on the damage criterion equation, 0(Y, D) D? ? ?F Y Y A , it can be seen that \n\nParameter 0Y  defines the start of the damage process, with A responsible for the \n\nintensity of the damage evolution. Figures 4.18 and 4.19 describe the influence of these \n\nparameters in the constitutive response. \n\n \nFigure 4.18 - Influence of Y0, on A=0.3 \n\nThe analysis of the curves shows that for lower values of Y0, the damage begins earlier, at \n\nlower strain values. In the limiting case where Y0=0, the damage occurs since the beginning \n\nof the strain evolving.

EXAMPLES ON POROELASTICITY COUPLED TO DAMAGE \n\nThe overall behavior of the porodamage problem is illustrated, identifying the influences of \n\ndamage in the poroelastic problem, as well as, inversely, regarding the presence of a fluid in \n\na damaged solid problem. To this end, examples inspired from the consolidation problems \n\ndiscussed in Section 4.2.1 are presented. \n\n4.4.1. Poroelastic Column Subject to Damage \n\nLet us consider a column of 10 m in height, unitary width (Figure 4.1), consisting of Berea \n\nsandstone, whose parameters are presented in Table 4.1. A distributed loading equal to 15 \n\nMN/m is progressively applied over 200 s, on the upper drainage face. The damage \n\nparameters estimated for the material are of Y0=0.001 MPa and A=0.02 MPa.  The problem \n\nin question is explored by varying the drainage conditions. The incorporation of the effects \n\nresulting from the damage process to calculate the mechanical properties of the porous \n\nmedium, is also considered. The mesh adopted is the one already described in 4.2.1. \n\nThe responses regarding the four possible behaviors of the material are presented: elastic, \n\nporoelastic, elastic with damage and poroelastic coupled to damage (porodamage). It can be \n\nseen that the highest pore-pressure levels develop at the base of the column, hence strongly \n\nmanifesting the problem of fluid diffusion, while, at the top of the column the damage problem \n\nis prevalent.

Brief Comments on Shallow and Deep Foundation Structures \n\nBased on Schiffman\u2019s problem, presented in 4.2.2, it is proposed here to analyze that semi-\n\ninfinite domain, subject to a loading of 10 MN / m, applied monotonically over 100 s, \n\nconsidering the effects of damage on the solid matrix. It is assumed that the constituent \n\nmaterial is Berea sandstone, and that the domain is saturated by water. It is admitted that \n\nthis problem reasonably reproduces the conditions of service of a shallow foundation \n\nstructure along the construction of a building, in a reduced timescale. \n\nA second problem concerning to a deep foundation structure dug in Berea sandstone is also \n\nanalyzed in order to compare the responses of rock mass in both situations. It is assumed \n\nthat a single pile transmits the loading at 10 m deep. Analogously to the shallow foundation \n\nproblem, the simulation is carried out over the half-space, due to the simmetry.

In this case, the peak \n\nvalue of damage parameter is reached at around 95 s of analysis. \n\n \nFigure 4.52 - Damage evolution in deep and shallow foundations at 50 s; 80 s; 91.7 s \n\n0\n\n0,05\n\n0,1\n\n0,15\n\n0,2\n\n0,25\n\n0,3\n\n0,35\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\nd\na\nm\n\na\ng\n\ne\n p\n\na\nra\n\nm\ne\nte\n\nr\n\ntime (s)\n\nshallow deep\n\n500 1000 1500 2000\n\n8000\n\n8500\n\n9000\n\n9500\n\n10000\n\n500 1000 1500 2000\n\n8000\n\n8500\n\n9000\n\n9500\n\n10000\n\n500 1000 1500 2000\n\n8000\n\n8500\n\n9000\n\n9500\n\n10000\n\n500 1000 1500 2000\n\n8000\n\n8500\n\n9000\n\n9500\n\n10000\n\n500 1000 1500 2000\n\n8000\n\n8500\n\n9000\n\n9500\n\n10000\n\n500 1000 1500 2000\n\n8000\n\n8500\n\n9000\n\n9500\n\n10000\n\n0\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.1\n0.12\n0.14\n0.16\n0.18\n0.2\n0.22\n0.24\n0.26\n0.28\n0.3\n0.32\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nConclusions and Perspectives \n\n\n\nConclusions and Perspectives 109 \n\nA linear poroelastic modelling provides good results for the pore-pressure variation and \n\naccurately assesses the displacements in a porous medium, under instantaneous loading \n\nconditions. However, as shown in experimental studies of rocks and soils, in a loading \n\ncondition over time (monotonic), the stress-strain relationship is not well represented in the \n\nlinear poroelasticity theory. Thus, the interest arises to incorporate models of plasticity and/or \n\ndamage on the poroelastic formulation. \n\nA boundary element method formulation for the analysis of saturated porous media subject \n\nto an isotropic damage process was presented. Considering the abundant number of \n\nexperimental and theoretical studies on the subject, it is understood that one of the \n\ncontributions of this work was to develop a computational tool that can be applied to the \n\nsimulation of various engineering problems. \n\nThe results show that the presence of fluid in a porous solid matrix subject to damage \n\ninduces a degree of delay and attenuation in the evolution of the degradation levels. \n\nHowever, considering the damage occurrence in the solid skeleton of the poroelastic \n\nproblem substantiates increasing the pore-pressure values. \n\nIn this study, the damage process in the porous medium was dealt with in a simplistic way, in \n\norder to safely perform the coupling technique. Thus, the procedure of how to carry out the \n\ncoupling between models for poroelasticity and isotropic damage in a BEM formulation was \n\naccurately illustrated. \n\nAccording to the literature, the damage occurs quite differently in various porous materials. \n\nFor future works, studies on specific classes of materials are indicated, in order to better \n\nunderstand the mechanisms of deformation and rupture of these materials, adopting or \n\nproposing suitable nonlinear constitutive models. Throughout this text, some works that can \n\nserve as a basis for this purpose were listed, especially those relating to the experimental \n\nbehavior of soils and rocks. \n\nOne of the important features to be explored is the variation of permeability observed during \n\nthe occurrence of damage. Therefore, another line to be explored in future initiatives is the \n\ndetailed study and implementation of evolution laws for permeability based on experimental \n\nresults, giving rise to more complete coupled poro-damage models. \n\nIt should be noted that the code generated indicates interesting applications, such as the \n\nanalysis of the mechanical behavior of building foundations, which are influenced not only by \n\nthe stiffness of the skeleton, but also by the permeability of the support medium (soil or rock). \n\n \n\n\n\nPh.D. Thesis \u2013 Eduardo Toledo de Lima Junior 110 \n\n \n\n\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY1 \n\n \n\nARAMAKI, G., YASUHARA W.
