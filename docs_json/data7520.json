O objetivo deste \nestudo foi avaliar a influ\u00eancia de diferentes escalas \nespaciais e temporais na decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o de detritos foliares \ne os efeitos da composi\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica, invertebrados e micro-\norganismos em riachos de regi\u00e3o tropical (Brasil). Foram \nestudados rios do Norte de Minas Gerais (Capitulo 1 e 2) e \ndo planalto central em Bras\u00edlia (Capitulo 3). Assim, esta \ntese \u00e9 composta por 3 cap\u00edtulos e os seus principais \nresultados foram: 1- \u201cCoarse Particulate Organic \nMatter Dynamics in a Tropical Vereda System\u201d, onde a \nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o de serapilheira em \u00e1rea de veredas foi baixa \n(365g m-2 ano-1 de entrada terrestre e 181 g m-2 ano-1 \nvertical sobre o rio). A decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o foliar foi elevada \nquando comparada com outros sistemas tropicais, com \nvalores m\u00e1ximos coincidindo com o per\u00edodo chuvoso. O \nconte\u00fado de ergosterol das folhas foi elevado, mas as \ndensidades de esporos na \u00e1gua foram baixas. Menos de \n10% dos invertebrados foram fragmentadores, sugerindo \npouca participa\u00e7\u00e3o desta comunidade no processo de \ndecomposi\u00e7\u00e3o. Apesar da baixa produtividade e r\u00e1pida \ndecomposi\u00e7\u00e3o, a mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica acumulada no leito \u00e9 \nalta. Isso pode estar relacionado com ciclos de inunda\u00e7\u00e3o e \na din\u00e2mica de secas sazonais, permitindo o transporte de \ndetritos foliares das \u00e1reas terrestre atrav\u00e9s da corrente da \n\u00e1gua. 2- \u201cCanopy degradation effects on temporal leaf \nbreakdown rates in a tropical stream\u201d, os maiores \nvalores na taxa de decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o foram observados no \nper\u00edodo chuvoso, provavelmente devido \u00e0s altas \ntemperaturas (aumento da atividade metab\u00f3lica) e chuvas \n(maior abras\u00e3o f\u00edsica). Encontramos maior biomassa \nmicrobiana (aumento de organismos fotossint\u00e9ticos) e \nmaiores densidades e riqueza de invertebrados (menor \n\n\n\n2 \n \n\nlavagem da comunidade pela \u00e1gua) no per\u00edodo de seca. O \nfluxo de \u00e1gua, temperatura e precipita\u00e7\u00e3o foram os fatores \nque controlam a decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o neste sistema. A \ndegrada\u00e7\u00e3o do dossel modificou o k e pode altera o \nmetabolismo do ecossistema (heterotr\u00f3ficas para \nautotr\u00f3ficas), apesar da grande resist\u00eancia ecol\u00f3gica das \n\"veredas\". A degrada\u00e7\u00e3o do dossel tamb\u00e9m deixou o \nsistema mais suscet\u00edveis a altera\u00e7\u00f5es sazonais. Este \nimpacto ambiental modificou tamb\u00e9m as comunidades de \nmicro-organismos e invertebrados, indicando que este \nprocesso \u00e9 um \u00fatil bioindicador. 3- \u201cThe effects of spatial \nscale on breakdown of leaves in a tropical watershed\u201d, \nonde as comunidades microbiana e de fragmentadores \nforam mais influenciadas pela escala local (ordem de rio), \nconduzindo a decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o foliar nesta escala. Entretanto, \nas maiores influencias sobre o processo de decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o \nforam observadas em escala regional (sub-bacia), \nmostrando que a escala de estudo altera a resposta do \nprocesso estudado. As maiores taxas de decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o \n(independente da qualidade do detrito) ocorreram em \nambientes com elevados valores de velocidade da \u00e1gua, \noxig\u00eanio dissolvido e temperatura, os quais aceleram o \nmetabolismo biol\u00f3gico. Assim, bacias com microclimas \nmais quentes e c\u00f3rregos com n\u00edveis mais elevados de \nnutrientes e oxig\u00eanio poderiam estar acelerando o \nmetabolismo do ecossistema, independente da qualidade \ndetritos. \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nABSTRACT \n \nThe evaluation of the leaf breakdown at different \n\nlevels and scales (spatial and temporal) enables the \ndevelopment of integrated view of this important \necological process. The aim of this study was to evaluate \nthe influence of different spatial and temporal scales in the \nevaluation and the effects of chemical composition, \ninvertebrates and micro-organisms in streams of tropical \nregion (Brazil). Rivers in northern of Minas Gerais State \n(Chapter 1 and 2) and the central plateau in Bras\u00edlia City \n(Chapter 3) were studied. Thus, this thesis consists of three \nchapters and the main results were: 1- \u201cCoarse \nParticulate Organic Matter Dynamics in a Tropical \nVereda System\u201d; Litter production in the riparian area \nwas low (365g m-2 year-1 falling on the forest soil and 181 \ng m-2 year-1 fallen directly into the stream). The litter \nbreakdown was high when compared with other South \nAmerican systems, with maximum values coinciding with \nthe rainy season. Ergosterol content in decomposing leaves \nwas high, but spore densities in the water were low. Nearly \n10% of invertebrates were shredders suggesting a low role \nin litter decomposition. Despite the low litterfall and fast \ndecomposition, accumulated organic matter in the bed is \nhigh. This could be related to seasonal flood/dry dynamics \nallowing the transportation of terrestrial litter into the \nstream. 2- \u201cCanopy degradation effects on temporal leaf \nbreakdown rates in a tropical stream\u201d; Higher values of \nleaf breakdown rates (k) were observed in rainy season, \nmost likely due to high temperatures (increasing metabolic \nactivity) and rainfall (higher physical abrasion). However, \nwe found higher microbial biomass (increase of \nphotosynthetic organisms) and greater densities and \nrichness of invertebrates (lower washing power by water) \nin dry season. Therefore, on the large temporal sampling, \nwater flow, temperature and precipitation were the factors \ncontrolling the k in this stream system. The canopy \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\ndegradation modify the k and can change the metabolism \nof the ecosystem (from heterotrophic to autotrophic), \ndespite the great ecological resistance of \u201cveredas\u201d. The \ncanopy degradation left the system higher susceptible to \nseasonal changes. This environmental impact modified \nalso the communities of micro-organisms and invertebrates \nindicate that this process is useful as bioindicators. 3- \n\u201cThe effects of spatial scale on breakdown of leaves in a \ntropical watershed\u201d; The microbial and shredder were \nmost influenced at the local scale (stream order), leading to \nleaf breakdown in this scale. Moreover, differences in the \noverall k and abiotic variables were more strongly \ninfluenced at the regional scale (sub-basin), showing that \nthe study scale alters the response of the studied variables. \nWe found higher k values (independent of the detritus \nquality) at higher values of water velocity, dissolved \noxygen and temperature, all of which accelerate biological \nmetabolism in response to variations on the regional scale. \nWatersheds with warmer microclimates and streams with \nhigher nutrient levels and oxygen could be accelerating the \necosystem metabolism, independent of the detritus quality. \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nINTRODU\u00c7\u00c3O GERAL \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nINTRODU\u00c7\u00c3O GERAL  \n \nA origem da limnologia moderna geralmente \u00e9 \n\nreportada para o final do s\u00e9culo XIX, quando o m\u00e9dico \nsu\u00ed\u00e7o Fran\u00e7ois Alphonse Forel iniciou os seus estudos no \nlago L\u00e9man, publicando tr\u00eas volumes entre 1892 e 1904. \nEntretanto, duas figuras assumem grande relev\u00e2ncia na \nconsolida\u00e7\u00e3o da limnologia como uma importante \u00e1rea do \nconhecimento, s\u00e3o eles o entom\u00f3logo alem\u00e3o August \nFriedrich Thienemann e o bot\u00e2nico sueco Einar Christian \nLeonard Naumann. Thienemann e Naumann foram os \nfundadores da Sociedade Internacional de Limnologia - \nSIL (1922) que proporcionou grande impulso \u00e0 \nLimnologia, onde em seu primeiro congresso na cidade de \nKiel (Alemanha), foi redefinida como sendo \"a ci\u00eancia que \nestuda os corpos d\u2019\u00e1gua continentais do ponto de vista \necol\u00f3gico, independentemente do seu tamanho, origem e \nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o de sais\". Ap\u00f3s estes eventos, as mais diversas \nvertentes ligadas \u00e0 limnologia se desenvolveram e se \nconsolidaram ao passar dos anos. Uma destas vertentes que \nse consolidaram ao longo dos anos foi a relacionada \u00e0 \nciclagem de nutrientes e do fluxo de energia.  \n\nStephen Alfred Forbes trouxe o prenuncio do \nconceito de ecossistema, com ideias sobre din\u00e2mica de \nnutrientes e fluxo de energia na cadeia alimentar (Forbes, \n1887; Croker, 2001). Esta vis\u00e3o influenciou Charles Elton \nna d\u00e9cada de 1920, que tra\u00e7ou importantes rela\u00e7\u00f5es entre a \nforma de alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o dos seres vivos, concluindo que \nestas intera\u00e7\u00f5es tr\u00f3ficas ligam os organismos atrav\u00e9s da \ncomunidade biol\u00f3gica. Tansley na d\u00e9cada de 1930, \npreferiu discutir o sistema como uma associa\u00e7\u00e3o de \nanimais e plantas juntamente com os fatores f\u00edsicos, \ndenominada ecossistema. Nesta mesma \u00e9poca Alfred J. \nLotka, discorreu sobre as taxas de transforma\u00e7\u00e3o de \nenergia e mat\u00e9ria dentro dos sistemas ecol\u00f3gicos atrav\u00e9s \ndos princ\u00edpios termodin\u00e2micos. Assim, todas estas \nquest\u00f5es culminaram em Raymond Lindeman, que foi \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nrespons\u00e1vel por introduzir a ideia do ecossistema como um \nsistema transformador de energia, fornecendo uma nota\u00e7\u00e3o \nformal para o fluxo energ\u00e9tico nos diferentes n\u00edveis \ntr\u00f3ficos (Lindeman, 1942). A partir das ideias propostas \npor Elton (teia alimentar), Lotka (transforma\u00e7\u00e3o de \nenergia) e Tansley (ecossistema) brilhantemente agrupadas \nao conceito de ecossistema por Lindeman, surgiu uma \nnova proposta de compreens\u00e3o dos sistemas ecol\u00f3gicos \n(Lindeman, 1942; Ricklefs, 2003). Desta fus\u00e3o de \nconceitos, novos elementos foram propostos para melhorar \no entendimento dos sistemas ecol\u00f3gicos, que foram: \ncadeia alimentar, n\u00edveis tr\u00f3ficos e pir\u00e2mide de energia. Na \nd\u00e9cada de 1950, por interm\u00e9dio de Eugene Odum ganha \nfor\u00e7a a ecologia ecossist\u00eamica, fundamentada nestes novos \nconceitos, tratando principalmente do fluxo de energia e \nreciclagem de mat\u00e9ria em diversos ecossistemas e \ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es. \n\nOs enfoques dos estudos referentes ao fluxo de \nenergia e ciclagem de mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica em ecossistemas \naqu\u00e1ticos sofreram mudan\u00e7a ao longo do tempo, \ncaminhando para uma vis\u00e3o mais abrangente dos \necossistemas, integrando padr\u00f5es e processos em v\u00e1rios \nn\u00edveis de organiza\u00e7\u00e3o (Hynes 1970; Allan 1995, Cummins \net al., 1995, Wallace et al., 1997). Uma consequ\u00eancia \nimportante foram as primeiras pesquisas sobre \ndecomposi\u00e7\u00e3o de tecido vegetal de origem al\u00f3ctone \nrealizadas por Kaushik &amp; Hynes (1971) e Petersen &amp; \nCummins (1974), impulsionando os estudos para outros \nprocessos e sistemas (Cummins 1974, Minshall 1988, \nCummins et al. 1995). Tank et al. (2010), em um trabalho \nde revis\u00e3o construiram uma linha do tempo (Figura 1), \nilustrando as principais contribui\u00e7\u00f5es para a compreens\u00e3o \ndo processamento da mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica em ecossistemas \nl\u00f3ticos a partir de Lindeman (1942).  \n\nO avan\u00e7o dos estudos limnol\u00f3gicos sobre o \nprocessamento da mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica foi importante \nprincipalmente para as regi\u00f5es de cabeceira dos rios. \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nNormalmente estes ambientes s\u00e3o compostos por rios de \nprimeira ordem que apresentam vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o ciliar \nsombreando o leito do riacho, formando matas de galerias. \nNestes ambientes a mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica al\u00f3ctone proveniente \nda vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o rip\u00e1ria \u00e9 uma fonte de energia fundamental \npara as comunidades aqu\u00e1ticas, pela baixa luminosidade \nque limita a produ\u00e7\u00e3o prim\u00e1ria (Mosisch et al., 2001). Fica \nevidente que a decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o de detritos vegetais \u00e9 um \nprocesso ecol\u00f3gico chave para o funcionamento dos \necossistemas l\u00f3ticos (Gessner et al., 1999), pois \u00e9 por ela \nque os nutrientes s\u00e3o mineralizados e disponibilizados para \nos produtores prim\u00e1rios, permitindo sua remobiliza\u00e7\u00e3o \npara a cadeia tr\u00f3fica (Allan, 1997; Cleveland et al., 2004). \n\nGessner et al. (1999) prop\u00f4s um modelo \ntradicional de decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o de detritos vegetais que \nsepara este processo em 3 fases: A lixivia\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 a r\u00e1pida \nperda de componentes qu\u00edmicos sol\u00faveis presentes no \ndetrito ap\u00f3s a imers\u00e3o em \u00e1gua (horas). O \ncondicionamento (semanas) corresponde \u00e0 modifica\u00e7\u00e3o \nda matriz do detrito por incremento da biomassa de micro-\norganismos, acarretando em um enriquecimento \nnutricional e melhorando sua palatabilidade para os \nmacroinvertebrados detrit\u00edvoros chamados \nfragmentadores. Os fragmentadores colonizam o detrito \n(meses), e conseguem fazer uso direto do tecido foliar. \nOcorre tamb\u00e9m a fragmenta\u00e7\u00e3o f\u00edsica por abras\u00e3o \ndecorrente das condi\u00e7\u00f5es do meio, que assim como a \nfragmenta\u00e7\u00e3o biol\u00f3gica, seria a redu\u00e7\u00e3o do detrito em \npart\u00edculas menores. Entretanto, esta sequ\u00eancia de eventos \nocorre simultaneamente e interagem durante toda o \nprocesso de decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o dos detritos.  \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\n \n \nFigura 1. Linha do tempo ilustrando as principais contribui\u00e7\u00f5es para a \ncompreens\u00e3o da din\u00e2mica de mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica, decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o e  metabolismo \nem ecossistemas l\u00f3ticos. Adaptado de Tank et al., (2010). \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nOs invertebrados aqu\u00e1ticos s\u00e3o importantes no \nprocesso de decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o, principalmente os pertencentes \nao grupo tr\u00f3fico funcional dos fragmentadores, que se \nalimentam diretamente do tecido foliar e s\u00e3o mais \nabundantes em trechos de cabeceira (Wallace et al., 1982; \nCummins et al. 1989; Gra\u00e7a 2001). Por\u00e9m, a relev\u00e2ncia \ndeste grupo tr\u00f3fico funcional tem sido questionada no \nprocessamento de mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica de origem vegetal nos \necossistemas tropicais (Dobson et al. 2002), ao menos no \nbioma Cerrado. Em rios de regi\u00f5es tropicais a presen\u00e7a de \nfragmentadores tem se mostrado muitas vezes rara (Yule et \nal., 2009), permitindo que outros grupos tr\u00f3ficos \nfuncionais (p.ex. raspadores) preencham este papel \nfuncional (Covich, 1988, Rezende et al., 2010) e tamb\u00e9m \nconferindo aos micro-organismos decompositores maior \nimport\u00e2ncia neste processo (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2005; \nMoretti et al., 2007).  \n\nA coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o bacteriana em folhas tem uma \nimport\u00e2ncia relativa menor em termos de biomassa \n(Gaudes et al. 2009; Rinc\u00f3n &amp; Santelloco 2009). \nNormalmente, participam ativamente da coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o nos \nest\u00e1gios iniciais da decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o e atuam sobre mol\u00e9culas \nde f\u00e1cil assimila\u00e7\u00e3o (Petersen et al., 1989; Tanaka, 1991). \nDiante desse fato, especial aten\u00e7\u00e3o tem sido dada ao \nestudo dos fungos avaliando seu papel na decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o e \nno incremento nutricional do substrato (qualidade do \ndetrito), devido \u00e0 sua capacidade de metabolizar mol\u00e9culas \nde dif\u00edcil decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o como celulose e lignina (Canhoto \n&amp; Gra\u00e7a, 1996; Gessner et al., 1999; Gra\u00e7a, 2001). Al\u00e9m \ndesta varia\u00e7\u00e3o, a comunidade bi\u00f3tica pode ser influenciada \npelos par\u00e2metros abi\u00f3ticos locais, como: a eleva\u00e7\u00e3o das \nconcentra\u00e7\u00f5es de nutrientes (da \u00e1gua e do detrito), \ntemperatura e vaz\u00e3o da \u00e1gua (Gulis &amp; Suberkropp, 2004; \nArd\u00f3n &amp; Pringle, 2007; Cornelissen et al. 2007). Estes \nfatores podem promover o aumento da diversidade das \ncomunidades decompositoras e de suas atividades, \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nacelerando a decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o foliar (Gulis &amp; Petersen et al. \n1989; Suberkropp, 1998; Cornelissen et al. 2007).  \n\nEntretanto, apesar de alguns padr\u00f5es observados \nsobre a decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o, existem incertezas principalmente \nsobre os ambientes tropicais, onde encontramos um menor \nn\u00famero de estudos quando comparados aos sistemas \ntemperados. Perguntas como a varia\u00e7\u00e3o na import\u00e2ncia dos \nfatores bi\u00f3ticos e abi\u00f3ticos ao longo de uma escala espacial \n(ponto amostral, ordem de rio e sub-bacia) e temporal \n(horas, dias, semanas, meses e anos) ainda n\u00e3o est\u00e3o \ndefinidas em sistemas tropicais. Estas quest\u00f5es se agravam \n\u00e0 medida que colocamos a influencia antr\u00f3pica (ex. \ndegrada\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental, perda de servi\u00e7os ambientais, \nemiss\u00e3o de carbono e etc.) e suas implica\u00e7\u00f5es para o \nfuncionamento do ecossistema. Assim, nota-se que devido \nao pouco tempo existente desde os primeiros estudos ainda \nh\u00e1 um longo caminho nesta \u00e1rea do conhecimento.  \n\nAo considerar o estudo da decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o foliar em \nmaiores escalas, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel o reconhecimento de padr\u00f5es \nemergentes e a identifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos fatores que estruturam os \necossistemas em diferentes escalas (Wiens 1989; Tiegs et \nal. 2009). Segundo Schneider (2001), estudos que abordem \napenas uma \u00fanica escala podem estar sujeito a problemas, \ncomo: (i) a maioria das vari\u00e1veis s\u00f3 podem ser medidas \ndiretamente em pequenas \u00e1reas ou ao longo de per\u00edodos de \ntempo curto; (ii) relativamente poucas vari\u00e1veis, podem \nser medidas em resolu\u00e7\u00e3o fina em grandes escalas; (iii) \nmudan\u00e7as em pequenas escalas n\u00e3o se mant\u00e9m em grandes \nescalas.  \n\nEspacialmente, a escala pode ser percebida como \n\u00e1reas de r\u00e1pido e remanso, que est\u00e3o dentro dos trechos, e \nestes est\u00e3o aninhados em rios extensos, que comp\u00f5em uma \nbacia hidrogr\u00e1fica, enquanto que temporalmente, temos \nprocessos que ocorrem em horas, outros levam dias, meses \nou anos (Wiens 2002; Tiegs et al. 2009). Assim, fica \nevidente uma s\u00e9rie de unidades geom\u00f3rficas e temporais \nsucessivamente menores aninhadas (Wiens 2002; Lowe et \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\nal. 2006) podem apresentar diferentes padr\u00f5es e estruturas \ne temporais a medida que mudamos a escala (Frissell et al. \n1986; Allan 2004). Atrav\u00e9s desta perspectiva, a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o \nda decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o em diferentes n\u00edveis possibilita o \ndesenvolvimento de uma vis\u00e3o integrada sobre a \u00f3tica \ndeste importante processo ecol\u00f3gico (Del Arco et al. \n2012).  \n\nPor\u00e9m, a maior parte dos trabalhos que avaliam a \ndecomposi\u00e7\u00e3o de detrito al\u00f3ctone usando a bacia \nhidrogr\u00e1fica como unidade de estudo ou longos per\u00edodos \ntemporais foram realizadas em sistemas temperados (Tank \net al. 2010; Del Arco et al. 2012). Assim, esta tese aborda \naspectos relacionados decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o de detritos foliares \nem sistemas rip\u00e1rios tropicais, avaliando os efeitos das \nescalas espacial e temporal em ambientes tropicais. Este \ndocumento foi subdividido em Introdu\u00e7\u00e3o Geral, \u00c1reas de \nEstudo, Cap\u00edtulos 1, 2 e 3 Considera\u00e7\u00f5es finais, \nPerspectivas Futuras.

Identificar o fator controlador em diferentes \ngradientes e escalas de estudo (ordem de rio e sub-\nbacias). \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\n\u00c1REA DE ESTUDO  \n \n\nOs experimento que comp\u00f5e esta tese ocorreram \nem zonas de vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o riparia do Bioma Cerrado. A \nvegeta\u00e7\u00e3o riparia \u00e9 um dos principais sistemas \nrespons\u00e1veis pela conserva\u00e7\u00e3o dos processos ecol\u00f3gicos \nnos sistemas aqu\u00e1ticos dos quais est\u00e3o associados (Naiman \n&amp; Decamps 1997; Wantzen et al., 2008). Este ambiente \nque naturalmente margeia os corpos aqu\u00e1ticos possui \nv\u00e1rias fun\u00e7\u00f5es como a filtragem do escoamento \nsuperficial, controle de aporte e eros\u00e3o pelo bloqueio das \nchuvas pela copa das \u00e1rvores, aumento da capacidade de \narmazenamento de \u00e1gua e o equil\u00edbrio t\u00e9rmico, que \nmant\u00eam a integridade da microbacia sobre sua influ\u00eancia \n(Naiman &amp; Decamps 1997; Lima &amp; Zakia, 2001).  \n\nA vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o riparia tamb\u00e9m serve como \nimportante corredor longitudinal e transversal para a troca \nde material e dispers\u00e3o da biota (Naiman et al., 2005), e \nportanto, \u00e9 muito mais que uma faixa-tamp\u00e3o (Naiman &amp; \nDecamps 1997; Wantzen et al., 2008). Este \u00e9 um ec\u00f3tono \ncom caracter\u00edstica peculiares em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 composi\u00e7\u00e3o \nflor\u00edstica, biodiversidade e processos ecol\u00f3gicos, \nexercendo grande controle no balan\u00e7o energ\u00e9tico dos \nsistemas l\u00f3ticos (Naiman &amp; Decamps 1997; Lima &amp; Zakia, \n2001; Wantzen et al., 2008).  \n\nA vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o rip\u00e1ria pode ser subdividida em duas \ncategoria, mata ciliar e mata de galeria. A mata ciliar \u00e9 \ndefinida como a vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o florestal que acompanha os rios \nde m\u00e9dio e grande porte, onde o dossel da vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o \nforma galerias. A mata de galeria corresponde a vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o \nque acompanha os rios de pequeno porte e c\u00f3rregos, \nformando corredores fechados (galerias) sobre o curso de \n\u00e1gua. A altura m\u00e9dia do estrato arb\u00f3reo varia entre 20 e 30 \nmetros, apresentando uma superposi\u00e7\u00e3o das copas que \nfornecem cobertura arb\u00f3rea de 70% a 95%, onde no seu \ninterior a umidade relativa \u00e9 alta. \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\nDentre os diferentes tipos de vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o rip\u00e1ria, o \nBioma Cerrado apresenta uma peculiaridade, que s\u00e3o os \nambientes de vereda, uma importante fitofisionomia deste \nbioma estudadas nos Cap\u00edtulos 1 e 2 (Figuras 2 e 3). As \nveredas s\u00e3o forma\u00e7\u00f5es vegetais hidr\u00f3filas, t\u00edpicas das \nmatas de galeria no Cerrado, e possuem como \ncaracter\u00edsticas rios com leitos bem definidos no per\u00edodo de \nseca seco, que se transformam em \u00e1reas pantanosas \ndurante o ver\u00e3o chuvoso, condicionada, basicamente, por \nfatores f\u00edsicos, como superf\u00edcies planas ou fundos planos \nalagados, associado a um camada superficial superposta \nacima de outra imperme\u00e1vel (Drummond et al. 2005; \nMoreira et al., 2011).  \n\nAs veredas al\u00e9m de possu\u00edrem import\u00e2ncia \necol\u00f3gica, tamb\u00e9m possuem import\u00e2ncia socioecon\u00f4mica \npara a comunidade local que explora comercialmente \nfrutos e folhas do buriti (Mauritia flexuosa L.) e fazem a \ncapta\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua para abastecimento. M flexuosa \u00e9 uma \npalmeira de folhas grandes que pode chegar a at\u00e9 35 \nmetros, nativa das regi\u00f5es Central e Norte da Am\u00e9rica do \nSul (Moreira et al., 2011). As veredas figuram tamb\u00e9m \nentre as \u00e1reas priorit\u00e1rias para conserva\u00e7\u00e3o do Cerrado \n(ref\u00fagios fauno-flor\u00edsticos), pois representam um \n\u201cber\u00e7\u00e1rio\u201d para diversas esp\u00e9cies de peixes de import\u00e2ncia \necon\u00f4mica para a regi\u00e3o e constituem fontes h\u00eddricas \n(nascentes), que alimentam os cursos d\u2019\u00e1gua (Drummond \net al. 2005; Moreira et al., 2011).  \n\nO local de estudo do Cap\u00edtulo 1 e 2 (Figuras 2 e \n3) corresponde a veredas pertencentes a bacia do Rio \nPandeiros, localizada nos Munic\u00edpios de Janu\u00e1ria, Bonito \nde Minas e C\u00f4nego Marinho, todos pertencentes ao estado \nde Minas Gerais. Estes munic\u00edpios est\u00e3o situados na regi\u00e3o \ndo M\u00e9dio S\u00e3o Francisco, no lado esquerdo do Rio S\u00e3o \nFrancisco da Microrregi\u00e3o de Janu\u00e1ria e Macrorregi\u00e3o \nNorte de Minas. Bonito de Minas possui \u00e1rea de 3.911,42 \nkm2, altitude m\u00e9dia de 600 metros, com uma popula\u00e7\u00e3o de \n3.902 habitantes. C\u00f4nego Marinho possui \u00e1rea de 1.640,20 \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\nkm2, altitude m\u00e9dia de 640 metros, com uma popula\u00e7\u00e3o de \n6.279 habitantes. O munic\u00edpio de Janu\u00e1ria possui \u00e1rea de \n6.670,41 km2, altitude m\u00e9dia de 455,59 metros, com uma \npopula\u00e7\u00e3o de 64.985 habitantes. Nestes munic\u00edpios \nlocaliza-se a \u00c1rea de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o Ambiental do Rio Pandeiros \n(APA-Pandeiros). Esta possui uma \u00e1rea de 380.000 ha., \ncom as tipologias florestais predominantes de Cerrado, \nFloresta Estacional Decidual e Semi-decidual e Veredas. \n\nO local de estudo do Cap\u00edtulo 3 (Figuras 4 e 5), \ncorresponde a matas de galeria da \u00c1rea de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o \nAmbiental (APA) Gama e Cabe\u00e7a do Veado, pertencente \nao Distrito Federal. A APA Gama e Cabe\u00e7a do Veado foi \ncriada pelo Decreto n\u00ba 9417 de 21 de abril de 1986 pelo \nGoverno do Distrito Federal, tendo como um dos \nprincipais objetivos a prote\u00e7\u00e3o das cabeceiras dos cursos \nd\u2019\u00e1gua que integram a bacia do Parano\u00e1 (Figura 4). Esta \n\u00e1rea possui cerca de 25.000 hectares compreendendo os \nmais diversos usos (urbano, rural, preserva\u00e7\u00e3o e \nexperimenta\u00e7\u00e3o), com destaques para as \u00e1reas: Reserva \nEcol\u00f3gica do IBGE (RESEC do IBGE); Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Ecol\u00f3gica \nUnB (ESEC da Universidade de Bras\u00edlia); Esta\u00e7\u00e3o \nEcol\u00f3gica do Jardim Bot\u00e2nico de Bras\u00edlia (ESEC do \nJardim Bot\u00e2nico), como as maiores \u00e1reas de preserva\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n\nA ESEC da Universidade de Bras\u00edlia \u00e9 uma \nfazenda experimental e de ensino da Universidade de \nBras\u00edlia com 4.500 hectares, onde cerca de 1.200 hectares \nest\u00e3o destinados \u00e0 experimentos e produ\u00e7\u00e3o agro-florestal, \n2.340 hectares para preserva\u00e7\u00e3o e o restante da \u00e1rea (cerca \nde 950 ha) mantidos em bom estado de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o.

Litter \nproduction in the riparian area was low (365g m-2 year-1 \nfalling on the forest soil and 181 g m-2 year-1 fallen directly \ninto the stream), but litter breakdown was high when \ncompared with other South American systems (k =0.033; \nrange 0.013 \u2013 0.084) with maximum values coinciding \nwith the rainy season. Ergosterol content in decomposing \nleaves was high when compared with other South \nAmerican studies (mean 549 \u00b5 g g-1; range 290 \u2013 1,183), \nbut spore densities in the water were low. Chironomids in \nthe benthos accounted for ~ 70% of all invertebrates; \nnearly 10% of non Chironomidae invertebrates were \nshredders. Invertebrates were not abundant in litter bags (X \nspecimens / g of litter) suggesting a low role in litter \ndecomposition.  Therefore, fungi are the drivers of litter \ndecomposition in the \u201cVereda\u201d. Despite the low litterfall \n(productivity) and fast decomposition, organic matter \naccumulated in the stream bed (> 1 m thick of litter). This \ncould be related to seasonal flood/dry dynamics allowing \nthe transportation of terrestrial litter into the stream.  \n \nKey words: decomposition, breakdown, litter fall, \nmicrobial communities, sporulation, shredders. \n \nINTRODUCTION  \n\nAllochthonous organic matter, particularly leaf \nlitter, is an important energy source for low order streams \nespecially where canopy shade stream beds limiting \nprimary production (Tank et al. 2010; Webster and Meyer \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\n1997). Studies on the dynamics of allochthonous organic \nmatter and leaf decomposition in streams are concentrated \nmainly in temperate deciduous forests (Abelho 2001; \nWebster and Meyer 1997) and, in a lesser extent in the \ntropical (but see Boulton et al. 2008; Wantzen et al. 2008). \n\u201cTropical stream\u201d is a designation for water bodies running \nthrough very heterogeneous environments, including \nrainforests, mountains, savannas dry forests, and others \n(Boulton et al. 2008). Among those environments, \ngrasslands or savanna occupy large areas of South America \nand are locally known as \u201cLlanos\u201d, \u201cPampas\u201d and \n\u201cCerrados\u201d, the later can have a larger number of trees.  \n\nIn some grasslands groundwater outcrops along \nstreams promote the formation of swampy gallery forests \nlocally known as \u201cveredas\u201d in Portuguese and \n\u201cmorichales\u201d in several Spanish speaking countries \n(Moreira et al. 2011; San-Jose et al. 2010). The veredas are \ncharacterized by  Mauritia spp. palm trees (Moreira et al. \n2011) and subject to seasonal inundations pulse (see also \nthe flood pulse concept by Junk et al. 1989). Veredas are \npriority areas for the Cerrado conservation because they \nare biological refuges, nursery areas for many fish with \neconomic local value and source of water for local \npopulations (Drummond et al. 2005; Moreira et al. 2011; \nSan-Jose et al. 2010). Veredas are also threatened by \npollution and habitat modification for food production.  \n\nGiven the high tree and shrub density of some \nveredas, it is likely that organic matter in these systems \ncould be an important energy source for their streams. As \nfar as we know, there is no baseline information about \norganic matter input and nutrient cycling / litter \ndecomposition and therefore it is difficult to measure \ndeviations from the reference conditions in these systems \nsubjected to strong human pressure including agriculture, \nlivestock production and wood harvesting (Boaventura \n2007; Moreira et al. 2011).  \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\nWe made four predictions regarding the organic \nmatter dynamics in a vereda. Firstly, we predicted that \nbecause of elevated temperatures and non-limiting water \navailability, primary production in a veredas is high, \nresulting in large production of litter. We also predicted \nseasonality in litterfall, with peaks coinciding with the dry \nseason (water stress) and with the onset of rainy season (by \nmechanically leaf removal). Because \u201ctropical\u201d streams \nhave often been referred in the literature as poor in \nshredders (Abelho 2001; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2007; Moulton et \nal. 2010; Wantzen and Wagner 2006) and poor in aquatic \nhyphomycetes (Schoenlein-Crusius and Grandi 2003), our \nthird prediction is that shredders and aquatic \nhyphomycetes will not be abundant and, consequently, \ndecomposition will be slow.  \n\nFinally, as physical abrasion is an important \nprocess in leaf breakdown (particularly when there is low \nmicrobial and shredder activity), then we predicted that \ndecomposition would be faster during the rainy season. To \naddress the above predictions we assessed litterfall, litter \nbreakdown, density and biomass of invertebrates, and \nmicrobial biomass and sporulation of aquatic \nhyphomycetes of detritus during one year in a \nSoutheastern Brazil vereda. \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\nStudy Site \n\nThe study was carried out in the Pandeiros River \nbasin, in Brazil, a sub-arid region with 900 \u2013 1,200 mm \nrainfall and 24 \u00b0C mean temperature (Fig. 1). Litterfall was \nmeasured monthly from April 2009 to March 2010 along a \n50-m-long strip in the vereda. \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\n \nFig. 1 Sampling site in Pandeiros River Basin in Minas Gerais, Brazil. \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\nPhysical and Chemical parameters of the stream \nwaters \n\nA multianalyzer (YSI Incorporated, model 85) was \nused to measure the in situ temperature, electrical \nconductivity, pH, and dissolved oxygen. Luminosity at the \nstream surface was continuously recorded with a \ndatalogger (Onset, HOBO UA-002-08). We estimated \nwater current velocity with a flow meter (Global Water; \nmodel Sigma Sports FP101) depth and width with \nmeasuring tapes. Water samples were collected (sterile \nvials) placed into ice boxes and transported to the \nlaboratory to measure total alkalinity (Gram method; \nCarmouze 1994), nitrate (cadmium reduction method; \ndetection limit: 0.05), ammonia (Nesslerization method; \ndetection limit: 0.05) and orthophosphate \n(vanadomolybdophosphoric acid method; detection limit: \n0.015; Bartram and Ballance 1996 ; Clesceri et al. 1989). \nThe canopy openness was quantified using hemispherical \nphotographs taken with a fisheye lens. Data of rainfall and \nair temperature were obtained from the meteorological \nstation (number 83386), located 15\u00ba 26\u2019 S, 44\u00ba22\u2019 W, and \n473.6 m altitude of National Agency of Waters of Brazil \navailable on the website hidroweb \n(http://hidroweb.ana.gov.br/).  \n\n \nLitterfall \n\nThe organic matter falling directly to the ground \n(terrestrial input - TI) was estimated using 6 nets (1 m2, 1-\nmm mesh; 3 in each side of the stream; 10 m apart). Litter \nentering directly in the river (vertical input - VI) was \nmeasured using 30 buckets (0.53 m2) suspended with ropes \n2 m above the stream, transversely displayed in 5 rows, 6 \nbuckets each, with 10 m between adjacent rows. The \nbucket bottoms were perforated for rain water evacuation. \nAt monthly intervals the litter accumulated in the buckets \nwas retrieved, weighed (wet weight) in situ, and the bucket \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\nwith the highest (wet) leaf mass in each row was used for \nthe leaf breakdown experiments (see below).  \n\nThe contents of the remaining five buckets of each \nrow were oven dried to constant mass (60 \u00baC, 72 h); the \nresulting weight was used to estimate the moisture of the \nlitter used in the leaf breakdown experiment as a correction \nfactor. The dry material was separated into categories \nleaves, branches), reproductive material (flowers and \nfruits) and \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d. Leaves were identified \naccording to the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group II system \n(APGII 2003). \n\n \nLeaf litter breakdown and aquatics invertebrates \n\nLeaf breakdown is traditionally measured by \nimmersing known amounts of monospecific litter in \nstreams and samples recovered at time intervals to \ndetermine mass loss through time, frequently fitting the \nmass loss values in an exponential regression (mass over \ntime; see B\u00e4rlocher 2005). This process demands frequent \nvisits to the experimental site, which is not practical if \nseasonal variation is investigated in remote areas. \nMoreover, litter used in these experiments may not reflect \nthe real quality of the litter reaching streams during the \nexperiments. As an alternative, the material collected in \nfive of the buckets above the stream was weighed (see \nabove), and placed in 30 \u00d7 30 cm litter bags, 10 mm mesh \nsize and submerged in the stream until the next sampling \nperiod (30 days). The amount of material placed in bags \nranged from 1 to 3 g. After one month, litter samples were \nremoved and replaced by new ones. After removal, litter \nbags were placed into boxes with ice and transported to the \nlaboratory. \n\nIn the laboratory, litter remains were washed with \ndistilled water over a 250-\u00b5 m sieve. The retained \ninvertebrates were fixed in 70% ethanol and later \nidentified to the family level according to P\u00e9rez (1988); \nMerritt and Cummins (1996) and classified into five \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\nfunctional trophic groups (P\u00e9rez 1988; Merritt and \nCummins 1996): gathering-collectors, filtering-collectors, \nshredders, scrapers, and predators.  \n\nLeaf discs (12-mm diameter) were removed from \nrandomly selected leaves for ash-free dry mass (AFDM) \ncalculations, ergosterol, ATP and sporulation (5 discs for \neach analysis; see below). The remaining litter was placed \nin aluminum trays and dried in an oven at 60\u00b0C for 72 h to \ndetermine the dry weight.  \n\n \nMicrobial biomass \n\nThe biomass of the fungi associated with the \ndecomposing leaf litter was assessed by ergosterol content \naccording to Gessner (2005). The lipid was extracted by \nboiling the samples in KOH/methanol, and the obtained \nextract was filtered. The ergosterol was then eluted in \nisopropanol and analyzed by high-performance liquid \nchromatography (HPLC). The total biomass of the \ndecomposer microorganisms (aquatic hyphomycetes and \nothers) was measured by quantifying the ATP in the leaves \nas described in Abelho (2005): leaf discs were \nhomogenized (Polytron, 1 min, position 30) and the \nresulting material centrifuged (Eppendorf 5430R, 20 min, \n4\u00b0 C and 10,000 g), filtered (Sterile Millipore, 0.2 \u00b5 m) at \n10\u00ba C and the samples were placed in a reaction vessel \n(Eppendorf, 2 ml) with the Firelight enzyme (50 \u00b5 m), and \nthe bioluminescence (proportional to the ATP level) was \nmeasured in a luminometer (Luciferin-Luciferase \nreaction). \n\n \nAquatic hyphomycetes \n\nTo assess the sporulation of the hyphomycetes in \nthe decomposing litter, five discs from each litter bag were \nincubated separately in an orbital shaker (100 rpm) in \nErlenmeyer flasks with 50 ml of filtered (Sterile Millipore \n5mwp, 0.25 mm) river water at 25 \u00ba C in the laboratory. \nAfter 48 h, the suspension containing the spores was fixed \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\nwith formaldehyde for counting and identification under \nthe microscope according with B\u00e4rlocher (2005) and Gulis \net al. (2005). In addition, to determine the richness and \ndensity of the hyphomycete spores in the water column, 5 \nL of water were  filtered and stained with lactophenol \ncotton blue (0.1%) for later counting and identification \nunder the microscope (400 X). \n \nStatistical Analysis \n\nData normality was assessed with the \nKolmogorov-Smirnov test, the homogeneity of variances \nwas assessed with Levene\u2019s test, and values were Ln (+1) \ntransformed if needed. For litter fall, differences between \nthe terrestrial and vertical inputs were analyzed by \nrepeated-measures ANOVA (RM-ANOVA). The RM-\nANOVA can be used in nested sampling, as when repeated \nmeasurements are taken from the same individual (in our \ncase, buckets and nets), or observational studies are \nconducted at several different spatial scales (mostly \nrandom effects), for more information see also the chapter \n11 of Crawley (2007). Contrasts analysis was used to \nassess differences between the categorical variables \n(Crawley 2007). Leaf litter breakdown rates (\u201ck\u201d) at \nmonthly intervals were obtained assuming a negative \nexponential model of percent mass loss during the 30 days \nof incubation (Wt=W0e\n\n-kt; Wt=remaining weight; \nW0=initial weight; -k=decay rate; t=time). RM-ANOVAs \nand contrasts analyses were used to test for significant \ndifferences between months (categorical variables) in the \nremaining mass, invertebrate and shredders abundances, \nmicrobial (ATP) and fungal biomass (ergosterol), \nsporulation rates and spore densities in the water.

Litterfall was seasonal - bimodal \nwith two input peaks, one in March - April and a second \n(larger) in September and October (F(11, 347) = 3.2, p &lt;\n0.001); minimum values were recorded between May and \nAugust. Litter inputs were correlated with rainfall (r = \n0.67, p = 0.01) i.e. maximum litterfall coincided with rainy \nevents, but not with maximum air temperature (r = 0.33, p \n= 0.31).  \n\nOverall, the major components of TI and VI were \nvirtually identical and composed mainly by leaves (68% \nTI, 63% VI) followed by branches (20% TI, 15% VI), \nmiscellaneous (8% TI, 15% VI) and reproductive material \n(4% TI, 7% VI; Table A1 and Fig. A1A and A1B). Among \nthe plant species, an unidentified liana (Indeterminate sp. \n2) was the largest contributor to leaf litter fall (especially \nbetween August and October), followed Cecropia \npachystachya Tr\u00e9cul (August to October), Zygia latifolia \n(L.) Fawc. and Rendle (October, December, and January) \nand a minor contribution by a second unidentified liana \nspecies (Indeterminate sp. 1), Croton urucurana Baill., \nMauritia flexuosa L.f., Simarouba versicolor A.St.-Hil., \nStyrax camporum Pohl and Xylopia emarginata Mart. in \nboth compartments (Fig. A2). \n\n \n\nLeaf Breakdown Rates \n\nOverall leaf litter lost on average 53% of its mass \n(range: 33-86%) in one month; that corresponds to a mean \nk value of 0.033 (0.013-0.084 range). Litter breakdown \nwas seasonal (F(1,50) = 7.4, p = 0.02), with maximum \nvalues in April, September and December (rainy season; r \n= 0.44, p = 0.01) and minimum in May to August (dry \n\n\n\n42 \n \n\nseason; Fig. 2 and 3). Highest leaf litter breakdown rates \nwere also correlated with C. urucurana (r = 0.72, p = 0.01) \nand M. flexuosa (r = 0.59, p = 0.04) were more abundant in \nthe litter. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 3 Remaining mass (black line - %) and decomposition rates (gray bars - \nk) along one year (means and standard error). \n \n\nMicrobial Assemblages \n\nThe mean (\u00b1 SE) ATP was 456 \u00b1 57 nmoles g-1 \nAFDM, with a maximum of 1327 nmoles g-1 in February \nand a minimum of 17 nmoles g-1 in December. The \ndifference was significant (F(1,50) = 49.15, p &lt;0.01) across \nmonths (Fig. 4A). The ergosterol mean (\u00b1SE) content in \nleaves was 549 \u00b1 88 \u00b5 g g-1 AFDM, with a maximum of \n1183.3 \u00b5g g-1 in August and a minimum of 289.8 \u00b5g g-1 in \nApril (Fig. 4B) but no differences across months (F(1,50) = \n0.23, p = 0.64). Ergosterol and ATP concentrations were \npositively correlated throughout the year (r = 0.56, p = \n0.01). The lowest Ergosterol (r = -0. 51, p = 0.01) and ATP \n\n\n\n43 \n \n\n(r = -0.34, p = 0.01) values were obtained during high \nflow. \n\nSporulation rates were highly variable with no \napparent relationship with other variables. Maximum \nsporulation rates in leaf litter reached 6.42 (spores/mg \nAFDM) in June, but zero spore production was found in \nJanuary, February, July and December (Fig. 4C) and no \ndifferences were observed across months (F(1,50) = 0.01, p \n= 0.92; mean 1.48 spores/mg-1 AFDM). In the same way, \nspore richness in the water was very low (mean of 2 fungal \nspecies, range of 0 to 6 spores mg-1 AFDM) with no \nmonthly variations (F(1,50) = 1.02, p = 0.43). The spores in \nthe water included Anguillospora filiformis, Anguillospora \nlong\u00edssima, Anguillospora furtive, Lunullospora curvula, \nLemoniera pseudofoscula, Tricelophorus acuminatus, and \nYpsilina gram\u00ednea. \n\n \nAquatic invertebrates \n\nThe number of invertebrates colonizing leaves \nranged from 197 (July) to 12 individuals g-1 AFDM \n(February), with an average of 84 individuals g-1 AFDM \nand no differences across months (F(1,50) &lt;0.7, p > 0.41; \nFig. 4D; Fig. A3). Neither total invertebrate nor shredder \ndensities were correlated with mass loss (r &lt;-0.08, p > \n0.54). The most abundant taxon in leaves was the \nChironomidae (Diptera), with 68% of total individuals \n(mean of 58 individuals g-1 AFDM). Nearly 10% of non \nChironomidae invertebrates were shredders and the most \nimportant taxon being the Odontoceridae (Trichoptera; \nFig. 4E; Fig. A4). \n\n\n\n44 \n \n\n \nFig. 4 Total microbial biomass (ATP nmoles /g AFDM; A), fungal biomass \n(ergosterol \u00b5 g / g AFDM; B), fungal spores (numbers / mg AFDM; C), \ninvertebrates density (ind/g, D) and percentage of shredders (E) in leaves \nafter one month in stream water (means and standard error). \n\nDISCUSSION \n\nOrganic Matter Dynamics \n\nOur first prediction that litter production would be \nhigh in the vereda was not supported. Our estimation of \ndirect litter input to the stream of 365 g m-2 year-1, was in \nthe lower range of the reported values for other tropical \nforests (113 \u2013 1445 g.m-2 year-1; reviewed by Abelho \n2001), but close to the 288 \u2013 336 g m-2 year-1 reported for \nother Cerrado streams (Fran\u00e7a et al. 2009; Gon\u00e7alves et al. \n2006a; Gon\u00e7alves and Callisto 2013). The real value of \norganic matter available for decomposers could be even \n\n\n\n45 \n \n\nlower since the direct input into the rivers was nearly half \nof the input measured as litterfall in the riparian area, a \ntendency also observed in other studies in the Cerrado (e.g. \nFran\u00e7a et al. 2009; Gon\u00e7alves and Callisto 2013) and in the \nAtlantic rain forest (697 in VI \u2013 856 in TI g m-2 year-1 by \nGon\u00e7alves et al. 2014).  \n\nHowever, the material falling in the riparian area \ncan potentially be accessed by aquatic decomposers. The \nveredas are subject to seasonal inundations pulse as \ndescribed by Junk et al. (1989) for flood pulse concept in \naquatic/terrestrial transition zone (ATTZ), and high waters \ncan take litter from the stream into the banks, but the \nreverse can also be true. It is therefore not clear how the \navailability of litter inputs to the aquatic system can be \nrelated with flood-dry seasonal dynamics. Since during \nhigh waters litter in the riparian zone is submerged, we \npropose a mean value of direct and riparian zones inputs, \nwhich in our case would be 273 g m-2 year-1. This low litter \nproductivity can be the result of Cerrado nutrient-poor \nsoils (Drummond et al. 2005; Moreira et al. 2011) and the \nstress imposed by the flood and dry cycles.  \n\nLitterfall was markedly seasonal as reported for \nother tropical systems (e.g. Abelho 2001; Wantzen et al. \n2008; Zhang et al. 2014) corroborating our second \nprediction. It was more intense at the end dry season and \nthe start of the rainy season (August, September, and \nOctober) suggesting that two types of leaves may be \narriving in the streams: (1) senescent leaves in the dry \nseason and (2) green leaves mechanically removed by the \nrain. If this is the case, leaf litter stock may be composed \nby leaves of contrasting quality, resulting in seasonal \ndifferences in decomposition rates.  \n\nLitterfall seasonality was driven mainly by the \ninput of the four dominant species in the litter: Cecropia \npachystachya and Zygia latifolia and the two lianas. This \ncontrasts with less species richness and evenness when \n\n\n\n46 \n \n\ncompared as other tropical streams (Fran\u00e7a et al. 2009; \nGon\u00e7alves and Callisto 2013; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2006a). \n\n \n\nLeaf Breakdown Rates \n\nLitter breakdown rates in this study (k~0.033) \nwere faster according to the classification of Webster and \nBenfield (1986) and the model proposed by Gon\u00e7alves et \nal. (2013; k > 0.017) for tropical systems. It was also faster \nthan values reported for Cerrado streams (0.0001 \u2013 0.015 \nin Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2007; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2012a; \nGon\u00e7alves et al. 2006b; Moretti et al. 2007b). These results \ndo not support our third prediction, although comparisons \nshould be done with caution since in the literature most \nvalues are obtained for leaves of single species. Our study \nhas used the mixture of available leaves in each season, \nwhich more closely represents natural conditions.  \n\nBiologically-driven leaf breakdown could be aided \nby physical abrasion since higher rates of breakdown \noccurred in the rainy period which is when the current \nincreased and physical fragmentation is expected to be \nmore intense (Rueda-Delgado et al. 2006; Santos Fonseca \net al. 2012), supporting our fourth prediction. Additionally, \nhigh waters may carry nutrients from the riparian zone \n(Naiman and D\u00e9camps 1997), which even at low levels, \nthey could stimulate microbial activity. Indeed, \ndecomposition seems to increase rapidly with nutrient \nconcentration in a Michaelis\u2013Menten type relationship \n(Ferreira et al. 2006) suggesting that at low ranges of \ndecomposition, small increases in nutrients can have a very \nimportant stimulatory effect on decomposition (Rosa et al. \n2013; Woodward et al. 2012). It is also possible that leaves \nfalling during the rainy season could be of better quality \nthan the senescent leaves of the dry season, due to the \nreduction of water stress and increased nutrient availability \n(higher decomposition). These results are different to those \nfound by Ferreira et al. (2014), who in their meta-analysis \n\n\n\n47 \n \n\nsuggests that the effect of nutrient enrichment might be \nstrongest in cold oligotrophic streams that depend on low-\nquality plant litter inputs. \n\nLitter breakdown is influenced by litter traits \n(Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2012b; Meentemeyer 1978; Rueda-\nDelgado et al. 2006); it is therefore expectable that, besides \nphysical abrasion and fungal activity, seasonal variation in \nlitter breakdown could reflect changes in the dominance of \nspecies in the litter. Indeed, faster decomposition rates \nwere observed when litter from Croton urucurana and \nMauritia flexuosa were more abundant. It would be \ninteresting to investigate the quality of leaves of the \ndominant species to determine whether seasonal \ndifferences in litter decomposition are controlled by the \nleaf quality.  \n\n \nBiological assemblages \n\nFungal biomass in decomposing litter in the \nvereda (549 \u00b188 \u00b5g ergosterol g-1 AFDM \u00b1SE) was higher \nthan the values reported for other South American savanna \nstreams (50 \u2013 420 \u00b5 g g-1 range for Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2007; \nGon\u00e7alves et al. 2006c), forest tropical streams (4 \u2013 180 \u00b5 g \ng-1 range for Capps et al. 2011; Foucreau et al. 2013; \nMacKenzie et al. 2013), and in the range of temperate \nstreams (200 \u2013 1200 \u00b5 g g-1 range for Danger et al. 2013; \nFeio et al. 2010; Lecerf et al. 2007). This suggests that \nfungi are important decomposers in veredas in contrast \nwith other South American studies. This importance was \nreinforced by the significant correlation between ergosterol \nand ATP. We also observed ATP values were high \ncompared to most temperate streams systems (0.13 \u2013 200 \nnmoles g-1 range for review of Abelho 2001) and similar to \nother tropical streams (100 \u2013 750 nmoles g-1 range for \nAbelho et al. 2005; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2007; Gon\u00e7alves et al. \n2006c).  \n\n\n\n48 \n \n\nThe high fungal biomass (especially in January \nand August) does not support our third prediction of low \nfungal biomass, but contrasted with the low and irregular \nsporulation rates in detritus and spore richness in the water \nwith zero spores in some months. It is possible that \nsporulation rates are naturally low in these systems or we \nmay be losing key undescribed spores, highlighting the \nneed for further research in this system. It is also possible \nthat low sporulation rates were a methodological artifact \nsince intense sporulation frequently occurs in less than one \nmonth after the leaves fall in the water (Ferreira et al. \n2012). If this is also the case in the vereda, we missed the \nimportant reproductive period. The most abundant spores \nin the sporulation experiments in all periods were from cf. \nA. filiformis, cf. A. longissima, and L. curvula which are \nnormally associated with warm waters (Chauvet and \nSuberkropp 1998). Low diversity of spores were also \nreported by Sridhar and Sudheep (2010) in southwest India \nand Ferreira et al. (2012; k range of 0.001 \u2013 0.034) in \nEcuadorian Amazon forest. \n\nInvertebrates are crucial to litter decomposition in \nmost temperate streams (Abelho 2001; Gessner et al. \n1999), but, in many tropical streams, they are less \nimportant (Boyero et al. 2012; Moulton et al. 2010). In the \nvereda, we also found a yearly mean lower (84 individuals \ng-1) than the referred for other savanna streams (2 \u2013 780 \nindividuals g-1 range for Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2012a; Gon\u00e7alves \net al. 2012b; Ligeiro et al. 2010; Moretti et al. 2007b), with \nthe highest values in the dry season (June and July). \nChironomids were dominant as in many others tropical \nstreams (Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2012a; Moretti et al. 2007a; \nWantzen and Wagner 2006). The proportion of shredders \n(10%) was similar than other Cerrado streams (0 \u2013 11% \nrange for Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2007; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2006c; \nMoretti et al. 2007b), supports our prediction, that \nshredders are not abundant and important in litter \nbreakdown.  \n\n\n\n49 \n \n\n  \nConclusion: Litter Dynamics in Veredas \n\nBesides the low productivity of the vereda, and the \nhigh litter breakdown rates, organic matter accumulation is \nhigh in these systems. The entire riparian area and stream \nbed was composed by > 1 m think pure organic substrate. \nThis can only happen if litter retention is high in relation to \nlitter decomposition at the (or below) the stream bed. A \nraise in litter productivity can be expected if seasonal \nflood/dry dynamics allows terrestrial input being \ntransported to the permanently wet channel. This subject \nneeds further investigation. The drivers of litter \ndecomposition in the \u201cVereda\u201d seem to be fungi, but their \nidentity and reproductive biology still needs to be \ninvestigated. As in many other tropical systems \ninvertebrates had little importance to litter decomposition \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n\nWe are grateful to The National Council of \nScientific and Technological Development (CNPq \u2013 \nproject number 480298/2008-4) and Minas Gerais \nResearch Foundation (FAPEMIG \u2013 project number APQ- \n2051-5.03/07) for financial support and a stipend provided \nthrough. \n \nREFERENCES \nAbelho M (2001) From litterfall to breakdown in streams: \n\na review Scientific World Journal 1:656-680 \ndoi:10.1100/tsw.2001.103 \n\nAbelho M (2005) Extraction and quantification of ATP as \na measure of microbial biomass.

The vertical input \nof leaves was collected monthly in a natural stream and \nincubated in a stream with a degraded canopy. In each \nmonth, the samples were collected, and other new samples \nwere incubated. The k, microbial biomass (ergosterol and \nATP), fungal sporulation and invertebrate community \ncharacteristics (biomass density, richness and trophic \nfunctional groups) were estimated in the detritus leaves. \nHigher values of k were observed in rainy season, most \nlikely due to high temperatures (increasing metabolic \nactivity) and rainfall (higher physical abrasion). However, \nwe found higher microbial biomass (increase of \nphotosynthetic organisms) and greater densities and \nrichness of invertebrates (lower washing power by water) \nin dry season. Therefore, on the large temporal sampling, \nwater flow, temperature and precipitation were the factors \ncontrolling the k in this stream system. The canopy \ndegradation modify the k and can change the metabolism \nof the ecosystem (from heterotrophic to autotrophic), \ndespite the great ecological resistance of \u201cveredas\u201d. The \ncanopy degradation left the system higher susceptible to \nseasonal changes. This environmental impact modified \nalso the communities of micro-organisms and invertebrates \nindicate that this process is useful as bioindicators. \n \nKeywords: Precipitation Effects; Veredas; decomposition \ncommunity. \n\n\n\n64 \n \n\nINTRODUCTION \nEnergy flow and organic-matter cycling in aquatic \n\nenvironments are fundamental for the maintenance of the \nsystem\u2019s metabolism and, therefore, for the structuring of \nthe local communities (Fisher and Likens 1972; Tank et al. \n2010), especially in shaded patches, where the primary \nproduction is limited by the low-light conditions (Gessner \net al. 1999; Gra\u00e7a 2001). The quantity, quality, processing \nand retention of allochthonous organic matter in streams \nare associated mostly with climatic factors, being strongly \ndirected by seasonal and physiological changes in the \nvegetation (plant phenology; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2006a; Li \nand Dudgeon 2011). Decomposition is a key process in the \nremobilization of this organic detritus into the trophic \nchain because decomposition makes available the nutrients \nand energy retained in the dead organic matter (Abelho \n2001; Petersen and Cummins 1974). According to Gessner \net al. (1999), decomposition is biologically driven by the \nmicroorganism (fungi and bacteria) and invertebrate \n(mostly the shredders) communities in a sequence of \nevents named leaching, conditioning and fragmentation. \nHowever, we have no found information about this process \nin \u201cveredas\u201d systems that are common in the Brazilian \nSavannah. \n\nThe \u201cveredas\u201d are hydrophilous vegetation \nformations typical of the gallery forests in the Cerrado \nbiome and are characterized by rivers with well-defined \nriver beds during the dry season that transform into \nwetland areas during the rainy season (Moreira et al. \n2011). The \u201cveredas\u201d are conditioned essentially by \nphysical factors, such as flat surfaces or inundated bottoms \nassociated with a surface layer above a second, \nimpermeable layer (Drummond et al. 2005). In addition to \ntheir ecological importance, \u201cveredas\u201d are \nsocioeconomically important for the local communities, \nwhich sell the fruits and leaves of the Buriti palm \n(Mauritia flexuosa L.) and also use the systems for water \n\n\n\n65 \n \n\nsupply. The \u201cveredas\u201d are among the priority areas for the \nconservation of the Cerrado (faunal and floral refuges) \nbecause they act as nursery areas for many fish species \n(e.g., Hoplias malabaricus and Lophiosilurus alexandri) of \neconomic importance in the region and serve as water \nsources (springs) that feed the watercourses (Drummond et \nal. 2005; Moreira et al. 2011). Modifications of the \nstructure and composition of vegetation by commercial \nexploitation (a standard regional practice; Rezende et al. \n2012) may alter the organic matter cycling, which may \nlead to variations in the energy flow and threaten the \navailability of all these environmental services and, \nconsequently, the system\u2019s function. \n\nRiparian vegetation provides services such as \nfiltering the surface runoff, controlling the precipitation \ninput and soil erosion through tree canopies that block the \nrain, increasing the water-storage capacity and maintaining \nthe heat balance, thus maintaining the system integrity \n(Lima and Zakia 2001; Moreira et al. 2011). Clearcutting \nto stream edges changes streambed morphology, alters the \nphysical and chemical characteristics of the water, \nincreases sunlight exposure (affecting temperature and \nbiological activity) and decreases vegetation litter \n(quantity and quality) inputs (Lecerf and Richardson \n2010). Therefore, riparian vegetation can protect stream \necosystems against catastrophic events (natural and/or \nanthropic) that are under the control of terrestrial \necosystems (Lecerf and Richardson 2010). This buffering \nincludes protection against abrupt temporal/annual changes \nin water flux and, consequently, in ecological processes \n(e.g., leaf breakdown) and ecosystem functioning due to \nseasonal dynamics (Benda et al. 2004; Silva-Junior and \nMoulton 2011). This relation shows that ecological \nprocesses, such as leaf breakdown, can be used to detect \nenvironmental changes due to anthropic impacts (Pascoal \net al. 2001). \n\n\n\n66 \n \n\nThe use of leaf breakdown to detect anthropogenic \nenvironmental changes was developed mainly in the last \ndecade (Gessner and Chauvet 2002; Tank et al. 2010). \nHowever, few studies have been conducted in tropical \nstreams (Silva-Junior and Moulton 2011; Silva-Junior et al. \n2014). The data available in the literature concerning the \neffects of anthropic impacts (e.g., pollution) on leaf \nbreakdown are contradictory (Pascoal et al. 2001). Leaf \nbreakdown is faster with higher nutrient levels, but when \nthis enrichment is accompanied by another pollutant, we \ncan observe a negative effect and slower breakdown \n(Gessner and Chauvet 2002; Pascoal et al. 2001; Silva-\nJunior and Moulton 2011). The possible losses of \nenvironmental functions and services due to the \ndegradation of ecological processes in tropical regions are \namong the 100 fundamental ecological questions to \nanswer, according to Sutherland et al. (2013).  \n\nIf environmental and temporal/annual changes \n(due to anthropic and/or natural factors) occurring in \nriparian systems modify the leaf breakdown rates, our \nhypothesis is that: i) greater canopy openness will increase \nthe leaf breakdown rates in the rainy season due to higher \nphysical fragmentation (by rain) and microbial activity \n(due to higher temperatures); and ii) canopy degradation \nincreases the range of variation in the leaf breakdown \nprocess throughout the year due to the loss of the \nprotective function of the canopy. Our objectives were: i) \nto describe the temporal dynamics (over one year) of leaf \nbreakdown rates in a degraded \u201cveredas\u201d canopy (based on \nchanges in autotrophic metabolism due to the low \ncontribution of allochthonous organic matter); ii) to \ncharacterize the physical, chemical and biological changes \nin the leaf breakdown process throughout the year; and iii) \nto identify possible environmental indicators of riparian \ndegradation in the leaf breakdown process. We address the \nfollowing questions: i) What are the peaks and most \nimportant variables (abiotic and/or biotic) for leaf \n\n\n\n67 \n \n\nbreakdown rates throughout the year? ii) How does canopy \ndegradation affect stream functioning and the leaf \nbreakdown process? The research forms part of a larger \nstudy of \u201cveredas\u201d and an evaluation of streams in the \nPandeiros Basin, Minas Gerais/Brazil. \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\nStudy Site \n\nThe study was conducted in the Pandeiros River \nbasin, located in Minas Gerais State, southeastern Brazil. \nThis basin has the forest types of Cerrado, deciduous \nseasonal forest, semi-deciduous forest and \u201cvereda\u201d within \na sub-arid climate. The average rainfall varies from 900 to \n1,200 mm, with temperatures between 21\u00b0C and 24\u00b0C. The \n\u201cvereda\u201d used in this study was impacted by the removal \nof native vegetation, plant-extraction activities (M. \nflexuosa) and water withdrawal for human consumption \n(Fig. 1). The leaf detritus (vertical input) was collected \nmonthly by bucket in a preserved \u201cvereda\u201d and \ntransplanted to incubate in a \u201cvereda\u201d with an impacted \ncanopy. The riparian zone of the preserved \u201cvereda\u201d \ncontained plant individuals belonging to the following \ngroups: Indeterminate sp. 1 (Liana group), Indeterminate \nsp. 2 (Liana group), Cecropia pachystachya Tr\u00e9cul, Croton \nurucurana Baill., Mauritia flexuosa L.f., Simarouba \nversicolor A.St.-Hil., Styrax camporum Pohl, Xylopia \nemarginata Mart. and Zygia latifolia (L.) Fawc. and \nRendle. The collected material was used to identify plant \nfamilies according to the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group II \nsystem (APGII 2003). \n\n\n\n68 \n \n\n \nFig. 1. Sampling site in the Pandeiros River Basin and its location with regard to Minas Gerais State in Brazil. \n\n\n\n69 \n \n\nProcedure \nThe electrical conductivity, pH and dissolved \n\noxygen levels were measured in situ using a multianalyzer \n(YSI Incorporated, model 85). The luminosity and water \ntemperature at the stream surface were continuously \nrecorded with a datalogger (Onset, HOBO UA-002-08). \nThe total alkalinity was determined by the Gran method \naccording to Carmouze (1994), and in the water, the N \n(nitrate and ammonia; detection limit: 0.05) and P \n(orthophosphate; detection limit: 0.015) concentrations \nwere analyzed according to Clesceri et al. (1989). The \nrainfall and air temperature were obtained from a \nmeteorological station (number 83386), located at 15\u00ba 26\u2019 \nS, 44\u00ba22\u2019 W and 473.6 m altitude, of the National Agency \nof Waters of Brazil (available on the website hidroweb; \nhttp://hidroweb.ana.gov.br/), and the canopy openness was \nquantified using hemispherical photographs. \n\nThe experiment used litter bags (10 mm open \nmesh, 30 x 30 cm), with a sample (\u00b1 3 g of leaves) \nincubation period of 30 days. After this period, the samples \nwere removed, and new samples were incubated, \ncontaining the detritus from the direct input into the stream \nof the preserved \u201cvereda\u201d during the previous 30 days. The \nsamples were incubated at a depth of 0.2 to 0.5 m in \ncontact with the sediment. After removal, the litter bags \nwere placed into plastic bags inside of boxes with ice and \ntransported to the laboratory. The remaining leaf litter used \nin this study was used to estimate the initial dry weight \n(after being dried at 60 \u00baC for 72 h). In the laboratory, the \nleaves were washed with distilled water over a 180-\u00b5m \nsieve. The retained material was fixed (70% ethanol), and \nthe invertebrates were later identified to the family level \naccording to (P\u00e9rez 1988) and (Cummins et al. 2005). The \ntaxonomic richness and density were calculated for \ninvertebrates based on the community survey. The \ninvertebrates were classified into five functional trophic \ngroups (P\u00e9rez 1988; Cummins et al. 2005): gathering-\n\n\n\n70 \n \n\ncollectors (G-C), filtering-collectors (F-C), shredders (Sh), \nscrapers (Sc) and predators (P).  \n\nAfterward, discs (12 mm in diameter) were \nremoved from randomly selected leaves to analyze the ash-\nfree dry mass (AFDM), the microbial biomass measured \nbased on ergosterol and ATP concentrations and the \naquatic hyphomycete sporulation (5 discs for each \nanalysis). The total biomass of the decomposer \nmicroorganisms was determined by quantifying the ATP in \nthe litter fall according to Abelho (2005; using the \nluciferin-luciferase reaction). The fungal biomass was \nassessed by quantifying ergosterol concentrations \naccording to Gessner (2005; using a lipid exclusive to \nfungal membranes). Aquatic hyphomycete sporulation was \nassessed using discs from each litter bag according to \nB\u00e4rlocher (2005) and Gulis et al. (2005) based on posterior \ncounting and identification under the microscope (400 X). \nThe remaining litter fall was placed in trays and dried in an \noven at 60\u00b0C for 72 h to determine the dry weight. The \ninitial AFDM was obtained after incinerating the discs \n(550 \u00ba C for 4 h) and subtracting the proportion of the \nremaining material, which corresponded to the inorganic \nfraction, from the respective sample.  \n \nStatistical Analysis \n\nThe leaf breakdown rates (k) at the sampling \npoints in the sampling months were obtained assuming a \nlinear model (log transformed) of the percentage of mass \nlost during the 30 days of incubation (Wt = W0e\n\n-kt; Wt = \nremaining weight; W0 = initial weight; -k = decay rate; t = \ntime). Data normality was assessed with the Kolmogorov-\nSmirnov test, the homogeneity of variance was assessed \nwith Levene\u2019s test, and the data were log transformed \nwhen needed (Zar 1996). A repeated-measures ANOVA \n(RM-ANOVA) and contrast analysis were used to test for \nsignificant differences among months (categorical \nvariables) in the remaining mass, invertebrate community \n\n\n\n71 \n \n\n(richness, density and abundance of functional trophic \ngroups) and biomass of microorganisms (levels of \nergosterol, ATP and density of spores in the detritus-\ndependent variables). The association between some \nvariables was assessed with Spearman\u2019s correlation \nanalysis (?) considering p &lt;0.05 (Zar 1996). We also \ncompared invertebrate community structure among the \nstudied months with a permutational multivariate analysis \nof variance (PerMANOVA) based on the species and \nfunctional trophic groups using the Bray-Curtis distance \nmatrix and a permutation test (10000) with pseudo-F and \ndiscriminating months through a Bonferroni-corrected \npairwise comparison (using the Adonis function of the \nvegan package in R; Oksanen et al. 2008).  \n\nRESULTS \n\n Physical and chemical parameters of the stream waters \nThe mean discharge of the stream was 0.18 \u00b1 0.02 \n\nm3, with peaks in November and December.

The \npercentages of mass loss significantly differed among the studied \nmonths (ANOVA, F10, 36 = 6.75, p &lt;0.01), with higher values in \nNovember and December (contrast analysis; p &lt;0.05) and lower \nvalues in May to July (Fig. 2). The litter mass loss was positively \ncorrelated with rainfall (r = 0.44, p = 0.01) and the air and water \ntemperatures (r = 0.31, p = 0.02 and r = 0.47, p = 0.01, \nrespectively). \n\n \n\n \nFig. 2.

The \nergosterol and ATP concentrations (Fig. 3) were positively \ncorrelated throughout the year (r = 0.43, p &lt;0.01), but only the \nATP values were related to the litter breakdown (r = -0.43, p &lt;\n0.01).  \n\n \n\n \n \nFig. 3.

Sporulation rates were highly variable (RM-\nANOVA, F(10, 36 ) = 2.29, p = 0.03) and presented a negative \nrelationship with temperature (r = -0.33, p = 0.02). A qualitative \nsurvey in the water column contained spores of the species \nAnguillospora filiformis, Anguillospora long\u00edssima, \nLunullospora curvula and Fontanospora eccentrica.  \n\nThe most abundant taxon of invertebrates (\u00b1 SE) \nassociated with the litter breakdown was Chironomidae \n(Diptera), with 80% of the total individuals (mean of 293 \u00b1 33 \n\n\n\n75 \n \n\nindividuals.g-1 AFDM). The mean (\u00b1 SE) density of invertebrates \nranged from 49 \u00b1 43 individuals.g-1 AFDM (September) to 590 \u00b1 \n150 individuals.g-1 AFDM (July), and there were significant \ndifferences among months (Fig. 4; RM-ANOVA, F(10, 36 ) = 5.21, \np &lt;0.01). The richness (\u00b1 SE) of invertebrates ranged from 4 \n\u00b10.4 (January) to 10 \u00b1 0.5 (May) taxa and significantly differed \namong months (Fig. 4; RM-ANOVA, F(10, 36 ) = 4.58, p &lt;0.01). \nShredders represented only 9% of non-Chironomidae \ninvertebrates, with the highest values (RM-ANOVA, F(10, 36) = \n3.41, p &lt;0.01) in January (13%), April (13%) and August (12%) \nand lower values in September (3%) when the main taxa was \nOdontoceridae (Trichoptera). The invertebrate densities (r = 0.15, \np = 0.29) and shredder (r = -0.11, p = 0.44) abundances were not \ncorrelated with mass loss.

This may explain the lower flow of the present studied \nstream, due to decrease of water-storage capacity and \nmaintaining the system integrity by riparian vegetation (Lima \nand Zakia 2001). The loss of the hydrological functions by \nriparian vegetation, may be responsible for the water contained \nhigher values of pH, alkalinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients and \nconductivity other stream in the Pandeiros basin (Rezende et al. \n2012). This may indicate that environmental change caused by \ncanopy degradation due to plant-based extractivism may affect \nthe ecosystem, compromising some ecological services. \n\nCompared with a stream system with an intact canopy \n(\u00b19% canopy openness), we can expect a change in the \nmetabolism of canopy degradation system, increasing their \nsource of autotrophic resource for the higher incidence of light \n(Vannote et al. 1980). The canopy degradation to allow more \nlight incidence can also lead to an increase in temperature of the \nwater. This can be an important factor explaining the higher leaf \nbreakdown rates (k= -0.037), mainly in December (rainy season). \nTherefore, with the loss of the services by riparian vegetation as \ncontrolling the precipitation input (Lima and Zakia 2001; \nMoreira et al. 2011), we found higher water velocity (mechanical \nfragmentation and leaching), dissolved oxygen and temperatures, \nwhich accelerate biological metabolism (Gulis and Suberkropp \n2003; Medeiros et al. 2009), explaining the high rates of \ndecomposition. \n\nThis pattern indicates that canopy degradation modify \nthe ecological process studied and can change the metabolism of \nthe ecosystem (from heterotrophic to autotrophic), despite the \ngreat ecological resistance of \u201cveredas\u201d (Benda et al. 2004). This \n\n\n\n79 \n \n\nenvironmental impact also modified the communities of fungi \nand invertebrates, confirming our second hypothesis and \nindicating that the leaf breakdown process was useful as a \nbioindicator. The leaf breakdown rates were a useful indicator of \nimpacts, such as the organic pollution of urbanization areas \n(Pascoal et al. 2001) and the gradient of extensive agricultural \nchanges in the land use of the landscape (Hagen et al. 2006). Our \nstudy indicated that the macroinvertebrate community (with \nhigher density and richness under stochastic disturbance; Benda \net al. 2004) and total microbial community (with more \nphotosynthetic organisms after canopy degradation; Jugnia et al. \n2000) could be biological predictors. The increase in the density \nof biological communities during the leaf breakdown process by \nstochastic disturbance was also observed in other studies (Hagen \net al. 2006; Sponseller and Benfield 2001) and indicates that this \nvariable can be a useful indicator. Therefore, as also observed by \nSchwarz and Schwoerbel (1997), our data regarding the leaf \nbreakdown were dependent on the chemical and physical \nproperties of the leaves, the abundance of the decomposing \ncommunity and the climatic pattern. \n\nHowever the partial removal of vegetation for plant-\nbased extractivism can be considered a slight impact, most likely \nbecause plant removal is a structural modification and does not \nrepresent a source of pollution (e.g., the input of chemicals as \npesticides). The practices of agriculture-forestry, such as plant \nextractivism, cause smaller environmental changes than \nextensive agriculture and urbanization (Daniel et al. 2002; \nGardiner et al. 2009; Sponseller and Benfield 2001). Areas of \nextensive agriculture (Utz et al. 2009) and urbanization (Paul and \nMeyer 2001) have greater influence on biological communities, \neven when these land uses are present in small sizes and \nproportions on the landscape. Thus, the negative effects of \nextensive agriculture and urbanization are disproportionate \ncompared to other land uses (Johnson et al. 2012).  \n\n \n \nLeaf breakdown process \n\n\n\n80 \n \n\nThe leaf breakdown rates (k) in all the months (mean of -\n0.037) were described as fast (k > -0.017) except for April \n(intermediate values of -0.004 > k &lt;-0.017) according to the \nmodel proposed by Gon\u00e7alves et al. (2013). These k values are \nsuperior to those observed in other Cerrado streams (-0.0001 to -\n0.015 in Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2007; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2012a; Moretti \net al. 2007) but were in the lower range reported for tropical \nareas (-0.026 to -0.077) by Abelho (2001). We believe that the \nhigh temperatures recorded throughout the entire year (with a \nminimum of 21\u00b0C) had positive effects on the leaf breakdown \nrates  (Suberkropp and Chauvet 1995; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2012b). \nThe largest k was observed in the rainy season, evidencing a \nseasonal dynamic, and explains the positive correlation with \ntemperature and rainfall, confirming our first hypothesis. There \nmight also be synergistic interactions between higher physical \nabrasion (due to the higher rainfall and water flow; Santos \nFonseca et al. 2012), oxygen concentrations (which increases the \nactivity of aquatic fungi; Medeiros et al. 2009) and electrical \nconductivity (which indicates higher nutrient inputs; Chestnut \nand McDowell 2000) accelerating the leaf breakdown rates. This \nresult indicates that litter decomposition could be influenced by \ntemporal changes in abiotic conditions and, consequently, by \nchanges in the biological activity in this ecosystem. \n\nThe fungal biomass (ergosterol) was greater than in \nother Cerrado streams (50 to 420 \u00b5g.g-1 range for Gon\u00e7alves et \nal. 2007; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2006c), and the total microbial \ncommunity activity (ATP) was at the upper limit compared to \ntropical streams (100 to 750 nmoles.g-1 range for Abelho 2001; \nAbelho et al. 2005; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2007; Gon\u00e7alves et al. \n2006c). We found greater microbial biomass in periods of low \nwater flow due to a decrease of rain (i.e., in the dry season) that \nwas likely related to a decrease of lower physical abrasion and \nlower biofilm loss (Santos Fonseca et al. 2012). Another aspect is \nthat in the dry season, the low cloud formation enables a \nluminosity increase and stimulates photosynthetic organisms, \nrepresented by ATP concentration (Vannote et al. 1980), that use \nthe detritus only as a substrate, increasing the biofilm mass. \n\n\n\n81 \n \n\nHigher photosynthetic production (greater autotrophic resource; \nJugnia et al. 2000) was associated with lower metabolisms of \norganisms due to the temperature decrease in dry season (Sridhar \nand Sudheep 2010). This change might decrease the use of \nheterotrophic resources and explains the lower breakdown \ndespite the higher microbial biomass. Higher temperatures can \nhave a negative effect on fungal diversity, selecting only species \nwith the ability to develop in warmer settings (Chauvet and \nSuberkropp 1998), as observed in the fungal community of the \nstudied stream. These patterns explain the hyphomycetes\u2019 \ntendency to sporulate more in the dry season and the negative \ncorrelation of sporulation with temperature (Mathuriau and \nChauvet 2002; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2007). Therefore, our results \nshow that the increase of luminosity (corresponding to fewer \nclouds) and lower temperatures in dry season can lead to a higher \nuse of the autotrophic resource and a decrease of microbial \nactivity, thus slowing the leaf breakdown rates. \n\nWe found higher average densities of aquatic \ninvertebrate community than in other Cerrado streams (2 to 780 \nind/g range for Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2012a; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2006b; \nMoretti et al. 2007). The higher densities and richness, especially \nin dry season, can be explained by the negative correlation with \ntemperature (cool water could increase the oxygen dilution) and \nindirectly indicates lower rainfall (with a lower washing power \nby water; Santos Fonseca et al. 2012). The invertebrate \ncommunity was dominated by Chironomidae, as observed in \nother tropical streams (Boyero et al. 2012; Moulton et al. 2010; \nSilva-Junior and Moulton 2011). The lower abundance of \nshredders may explain the low importance of this community in \nthe leaf breakdown, as observed in other tropical streams (0 to \n11% range for Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2006c; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2007; \nMoretti et al. 2007). Odontoceridae was the most important \nshredder, but members of this group have also been classified as \nscrapers and as opportunistic scavengers feeding on animal and \nplant detritus (P\u00e9rez 1988; Cummins et al. 2005). The alternate \nfeeding strategies of this group would help explain the low \n\n\n\n82 \n \n\nparticipation and importance of the invertebrate community in \nthe leaf breakdown process. \n \nConclusion \n\nIn general, the data indicate that the partial removal of \nnative vegetation due to plant-based extractivism affect the \nfunctioning of this ecosystem. The leaf breakdown rates were \nfast throughout all the studied years, and the more openness left \nthe system higher susceptible to seasonal changes (Dudgeon et \nal. 2006; Naiman and D\u00e9camps 1997; Vannote et al. 1980). \nCanopy degradation might increase the frequency and intensity \nof disturbances (Benda et al. 2004) due to the loss of the capacity \nof riparian vegetation to stabilize ecological processes (Naiman \nand D\u00e9camps 1997). The high biological and physical-chemical \nvariation and the lower water flow are also initial indications that \nthe water-supply services might be impaired in the long term. \nThis finding is important information for \"veredas\" conservation \nand shows that despite the apparent process maintenance, the \ndynamics of such systems are being changed due to canopy \ndegradation by plant-based extractivism. \n\nThere was a clear seasonal variation in leaf decay, \nsuggesting that the temporal resolution chosen for a leaf \nbreakdown study may affect the detection of decay patterns. \nRainy season had a higher leaf breakdown rate due to higher \nwater flow, temperature and precipitation (Santos Fonseca et al. \n2012; Sridhar and Sudheep 2010). In the rainy season, higher \nleaf breakdown was observed despite the lower biomass of \ndecomposers due to lower dissolved oxygen, alkalinity and \nelectrical conductivity (P\u00e9rez 1988; Cummins et al. 2005). The \naquatic invertebrates (mainly shredders) and total \nmicroorganisms showed no overall influence on the leaf \nbreakdown. These results for a temporal macro-scale (month and \nyear) are similar to the results for a spatial macro-scale proposed \nby Wiens (1989). On a micro-scale (hours and days), the \nphenomenon can induce an increase in the heterogeneity of the \ndetected signal, but the macro-scale is affected by climatic \nfactors (Schwarz and Schwoerbel 1997; Wiens 1989). Thus, \n\n\n\n83 \n \n\nthese results indicated that on a temporal macro-scale (months \nand the average annual), the water flow, temperature and \nprecipitation are the factors that control the leaf breakdown rates. \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n\nWe are grateful to the National Council of Scientific and \nTechnological Development (CNPq \u2013 project number \n480298/2008-4) and the Minas Gerais Research Foundation \n(FAPEMIG \u2013 project number APQ- 2051-5.03/07) for financial \nsupport and a stipend. \n \nREFERENCES \nAbelho M (2001) From litterfall to breakdown in streams: a \n\nreview Scientific World Journal 1:656-680 \ndoi:10.1100/tsw.2001.103 \n\nAbelho M (2005) Extraction and quantification of ATP as a \nmeasure of microbial biomass.

DOI: \n10.1371/journal.pone.0097072 \n \nABSTRACT  \nThe objective was to assess the effects of natural variation in the \nphysical structure of the environment on biological communities \nand on the processing of Eucalyptus cloeziana and Inga laurina \nand to identify the controlling factors at different scales along \nstream order gradients. The study area consisted of 14 sampling \nsites distributed within a tropical watershed (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th \norder streams replicated in 4 sub-basins). Our samples consisted \nof 3 g of leaves of E. cloeziana (high-quality) and I. laurina \n(low-quality) placed in 252 bags with 10mm mesh (measured by \nthe chemical composition of the detritus). Four samples of each \nleaf type were collected periodically (three times) over a period \nof 75-125 days and washed on a sieve to separate the \ninvertebrates. A series of leaf disks were cut to determine ash-\nfree dry mass, polyphenol, lignin, cellulose, total microbial \nbiomass and fungal biomass, and the remaining material was \noven-dried to determine the dry weight. We performed analyses \nwithin and between spatial scales (regional and local) to assess \nwhich watershed scale was the more import determinant of the \nleaf breakdown rate (k). The microbial and shredder were most \ninfluenced at the local scale (stream order). Shredders were \ninfluenced by microorganisms, with stronger interactions \nbetween them than were found to drive the k at the local scale. \nMoreover, differences in the overall k and abiotic variables were \nmore strongly influenced at the regional scale (sub-basin), \nshowing that the study scale alters the response of the studied \nvariables. We found higher k values at higher values of water \nvelocity, dissolved oxygen and temperature, all of which \naccelerate biological metabolism in response to variations on the \nregional scale. Watersheds with warmer microclimates and \nstreams with higher nutrient levels and oxygen could be \n\n\n\n92 \n \n\naccelerating the ecosystem metabolism, independent of the \ndetritus quality. \n \nKeywords: Decomposition; sub-basin; stream order; \nmicroorganisms; shredders; detritus quality; abiotic variables. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nThe characteristics of lotic ecosystems show natural \npatterns along an upstream-downstream gradient due to \nvariations in geomorphology and topography in the watershed \n(Fabre and Chauvet 1998; Vannote et al. 1980). Natural changes \nalong this gradient (upstream to downstream) include an increase \nin the dimensions of the stream (width), changes (increases or \ndecreases) in the velocity of the water, and openings in the \nriparian canopy that allow greater light penetration (Benda et al. \n2004; Statzner and Higler 1985). Greater luminosity increases \nthe temperature and accelerates photosynthetic production and \nautotrophic metabolism (Statzner and Higler 1985). Along this \ngradient, therefore, the relative abundance of micro-organisms \nincreases but that of invertebrates decreases (primarily shredders \nof organic matter), decreases from the headwaters to the \ndownstream sections (Vannote et al. 1980). These natural \nchanges also modify the energy input and cycling of organic \nmatter in space and time (Larned et al. 2010; Vannote et al. \n1980). Senescent leaves are an important source of nutrients and \nfood resources in heterotrophic metabolic environments, \nprimarily in headwaters and small streams (Gessner et al. 1999; \nGra\u00e7a et al. 2001). However, this material is mineralized and \navailable for use by primary producers and other trophic levels \nafter its decomposition. As a result, leaf breakdown is a key \nprocess in lotic ecosystems (Gessner et al. 1999; Mathuriau and \nChauvet 2002). Leaf breakdown can be influenced by many \nfactors, such as physical and chemical variables (associated with \nwater and detritus) and the activities of communities of \ndecomposers (micro-organisms and aquatic invertebrates) \n\n\n\n93 \n \n\n(Abelho 2001; Gessner et al. 1999; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2013; Gra\u00e7a \net al. 2001; Mathuriau and Chauvet 2002; Moulton et al. 2010; \nSuberkropp and Chauvet 1995; Wantzen and Wagner 2006). \n\nThe study of leaf breakdown at the scale of a watershed \nallows us to observe emerging patterns and identify certain \nfactors that structure the ecosystems at different scales (Tiegs et \nal. 2009; Wiens 1989). It is evident that a series of successively \nsmaller and nested geomorphologic units can have various \npatterns and structures depending on the scale that is being \nanalyzed (Lowe et al. 2006; Wiens 1989). These patterns and \nstructures can be observed in riffles and pools within continuous \nstretches, which are nested within large rivers that make up a \nwatershed (Schneider 2001; Tiegs et al. 2009; Wiens 2002). \nStudies that address only one scale are subject to problems \nbecause certain variables are measured directly in small areas or \nacross short time intervals, whereas few can be measured at fine \nresolution over large areas (Schneider 2001; Wiens 2002). In \naddition, changes at smaller scales are not maintained at larger \nscales (Wiens 1989). Therefore, the issue is that unless patterns \nare consistent at all scales, the findings at one scale cannot be \nextrapolated to yield accurate predictions at other scales. \nAccordingly, tests at multiple scales are needed for confident \nextrapolation. From this perspective, the evaluation of leaf \nbreakdown at different scales enables the development of an \nintegrated vision of the landscape during this important \necological process (Allen and Starr 1982; Del Arco et al. 2012). \n\n  The streams in a watershed can be considered within a \nhierarchical framework that presents organized view of spatial \nand temporal variations among and within stream systems along \nthe \u201criverscapes\u201d (Allan 2004; Frissell et al. 1986; Royer and \nMinshall 2003). Therefore, several studies have examined leaf \nprocessing at large spatial scales across biomes (Irons et al. 1994; \nMinshall et al. 1983), latitudinal gradients (Irons et al. 1994),  \nand altitudinal gradients (Fabre and Chauvet 1998) and \ninfluences of land use (Hagen et al. 2006; Sponseller and \nBenfield 2001). Moreover, several recurrent topics emerge from \nconsiderations of several spatial scales. These topics include the \n\n\n\n94 \n \n\nrelative importance of fungi and invertebrates (Hieber and \nGessner 2002), the use of bioindicators (Del Arco et al. 2012) \nand the hierarchical nature of lotic ecosystems (Tiegs et al. \n2009). Studies assessing allochthonous leaf breakdown at a \nwatershed scale are rare worldwide, but they have been \nperformed in temperate systems (Del Arco et al. 2012; Royer and \nMinshall 2003; Tiegs et al. 2009; Young and Collier 2009) . \n\nIn tropical streams, individual riffles or short stream \nreaches continue to be the most frequent sites for studies of leaf \nprocessing based on the traditional conceptual model (Cummins \n1974; Petersen and Cummins 1974). Several factors are known \nto cause variation in the rates of processing within and among \ntropical stream reaches (Bianchini_Jr. 1999; Gon\u00e7alves et al. \n2013). These factors include the effects of species mixing \n(Bruder et al. 2013; Moretti et al. 2007), litter quality (Gon\u00e7alves \net al. 2007; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2012b), micro-organism \ncommunities (Medeiros et al. 2009; Wright and Covich 2005), \ninvertebrate communities (Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2012a; Li et al. 2009; \nLigeiro et al. 2010), detritivores and shredders (Boyero et al. \n2012; Wantzen and Wagner 2006) and seasonal effects (Larned \n2000; Mathuriau and Chauvet 2002; Rueda-Delgado et al. 2006). \nHowever, systematic assessments of variability in allochthonous \nleaf breakdown rates across multiple spatial scales using the \nwatershed as the sampling unit have not been performed in \ntropical stream systems. This study could help to answer \nimportant questions, such as \u201chow does spatial structure \ninfluence ecosystem function and how do we integrate within \nand between spatial scales to assess function\u201d, suggested by \nSutherland et al. (Sutherland et al. 2013) as one of 100 \nfundamental ecological questions. \n\nBased on the premise that leaf breakdown is the result of \nthe activity of decomposer organisms and the physical and \nchemical processes occurring in the stream water, which vary \nalong the scale investigated in the study scale (Abelho 2001; \nGessner et al. 1999; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2013), the following \nhypotheses were tested in this study: (i) natural differences in the \nphysical nature of the stream (increasing canopy opening, water \n\n\n\n95 \n \n\nvelocity, temperature and nutrient concentrations) accelerate \nbiological metabolism and leaf breakdown from upstream to \ndownstream; (ii) shredders decrease and micro-organisms \nincrease in importance from upstream to downstream; and (iii) \ndifferences in the overall k values will be more clearly \nunderstandable (strongly explained) at an increased spatial scale. \nThe objective of the study was to assess the natural effects of \nvariation in the physical environment on biological communities \nand the leaf breakdown rates of Eucalyptus cloeziana F. Muell \nand Inga laurina Sw. Willd and to identify the controlling factors \nat different scales along the stream order gradient. \n\nMETHODS \n\nThe Study System \nThe study area consisted of 14 sampling sites distributed \n\nalong the Gama-Cabe\u00e7a do Veado watershed, a part of the \nFederal District in west central Brazil, comprising 1st, 2nd, 3rd and \n4th order streams replicated in 4 sub-basins (Figure 1). The area \nincludes important waterways that form the Paran\u00e1 basin, a part \nof the Cerrado biome (Brazilian Savannah). The climate is \ntropical and has distinct rainy-hot (October to April) and cold-\ndry seasons (May to September). The mean annual temperature \nis 20\u00b0C, and the altitude varies between 1025 and 1150 m above \nsea level. The study area included three conservation units \nprotecting the entire watershed and all sampling sites studied \n(Ecological Station of the University of Bras\u00edlia, Ecological \nReserve of IBGE and Ecological Station of the Botanical \nGardens of Bras\u00edlia). The study was approved by Ministry of \nEnvironment of Brazil through the System of Information and \nAuthorization on Biodiversity (SISBIO) for activities with \nscientific purpose (code: 39629-1), and also was approved by the \nScientific and Technical Council of the Ecological Station of the \nUniversity of Bras\u00edlia (code: 05-12), IBGE Ecological Reserve \n(code: 54 PC - PAD 1) and Botanical Gardens of Bras\u00edlia (code: \n13/2011). \n\n\n\n96 \n \n\n \nFigure 1. Sampling sites. Geographic location of the sampling sites consisting of streams of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th orders replicated in 4 \nsub-basins in the Gama-Cabe\u00e7a de Veado watershed, Federal District (Brazil). \n\n\n\n97 \n \n\nProcedures \nThe experiment was conducted from June through \n\nOctober 2011 (the dry season), a period of zero rainfall, resulting \nin a high level of homogeneity in the physical and chemical \nfeatures of the environment. Based on their chemical \ncomposition, we selected leaves from two species for use as \ndetritus. The leaves of an exotic species (Eucalyptus cloeziana F. \nMuell) were used to represent high-quality detritus. The planting \nof Eucalyptus monocultures in place of the native vegetation has \npotential repercussions for stream basins. The area in which the \nstudy was conducted does not contain Eucalyptus plantations. \nHowever, the substitution of this monoculture for native \nvegetation has occurred in neighboring basins, where this \nmonoculture has expanded, as it has throughout Brazil, e.g., to \nsupply charcoal for steelmaking and pulp for papermaking \n(Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2012b). The low-quality detritus from a native \nspecies (abundant in riparian vegetation; Inga laurina Sw. Willd) \nwas also used in the study, as this species best represents the \nplants of the Cerrado. \n\nThe leave The two types of leaves were chemically \ncharacterized by the mean values of total polyphenols (22.80 \u00b1 \n2.5; 18.29 \u00b1 1.8 mg/g-1), total tannic acids (0.003 \u00b1 0.0002; 0.002 \n\u00b1 0.0004 mg/g-1), lignin (42.61 \u00b1 0.7; 45.94 \u00b1 0.5%), cellulose \n(24.69 \u00b1 1.5; 37.39 \u00b1 1.2%), hardness (0.17 \u00b1 0.1; 0.6 \u00b1 0.3 \ncm/g-1), nitrogen (13.16 \u00b1 1.3; 16.41 \u00b1 1.0 g/kg-1) and \nphosphorus (0.46 \u00b1 0.05; 0.53 \u00b1 0.07 g/kg-1) in E. cloeziana and \nI. laurina, respectively. The breakdown rates for these two leaf \ntypes (collected in nets 1 m2 in area placed 1.5 m from the \nground) were measured individually by the loss of weight of 3 g \n(\u00b1 0.1 g dry weight) of leaves, correcting for the initial humidity \nand transport loss (Gra\u00e7a et al. 2005), incubated in litter bags (15 \nx 15 cm, 10 mm mesh size).  \n\nIn total, 252 litter bags were placed at a depth of 0.3 m \nin pool areas at the 14 sampling sites in 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th order \nstreams (Strahler 1952) in the 4 sub-basins (Gama \u2013 SB1, \nCapetinga \u2013 SB2, Taquaras \u2013 SB3 and Cabe\u00e7a de Veado \u2013 SB4 \nsub-basins). The removal of the E. cloeziana and I. laurina \n\n\n\n98 \n \n\nleaves occurred initially after 10 days of incubation, which \ncorresponds to the expected time required for leaching and \ninitiating microbial colonization (Gra\u00e7a et al. 2005). After this \nsampling, the principal leaf breakdown rate (k) was used to \nestimate the next sampling time for each detritus type (at \napproximately 75% of the remaining mass), which was \ndetermined to be 40 days for E. cloeziana and 85 days for I. \nlaurina. This stage of decomposition occurs when microbial \nactivity is high and the invertebrate community is already \nestablished. Subsequently, the k value was used a second time to \nperform corrections and acquire new values to obtain \napproximately 50% of the remaining mass for each detritus type. \nThis sampling time was determined to be 75 days for E. \ncloeziana and 125 days for I. laurina. After this period, the \ncommunity established during the ecological process of \ndegradative succession is affected by the reduction in the \navailable detritus (additional information about k, see also \nChapter 6 of (Gra\u00e7a et al. 2005)).  \n\nThe sampling times were calculated by dividing the \ninitial weight (W0) by the estimated value of k. This calculation \nyields the time for the total course of leaf processing (TLP, \ndays). From the equation W0 / k = TLP, we can calculate how \nmany days will be required to reach a desired percentage of the \ninitial weight (Wt). The first sample was collected after 10 days \nof incubation for both species, so that TLP for 10 days / 0.25 = \nday on which Wt = 75%. The next sample was collected after 40 \ndays for E. cloeziana and after 75 days for I. laurina, so that TLP \n40/75 days / 0.5 = day by which Wt = 50%. The above procedure \nwas performed for each sample site (based on the mean value) \nand type of detritus. However, it was not possible to determine \nthe final value for I. laurina because the dry season ended after \n120 days, before 50% of the mass had been lost. Measurements \nafter the end of the dry season would not have been meaningful \nbecause variations in rainfall and associated variations in other \nphysical and chemical conditions would have influenced the \nresults.  \n\n\n\n99 \n \n\nOn removal from the streams, the litter bags were placed \nindividually into insulated plastic bags and transported in thermal \ncontainers (\u00b1 4\u00b0C) to the laboratory. Temperature, electrical \nconductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen and water turbidity were \nobtained in situ with a multi-analyzer measured each time leaf \nbags were removed. The depth and average speed of the right, \nleft and central portions of the watercourse were measured with a \nflow-meter, and the instantaneous discharge of water was then \ncalculated. We collected 1 L of water to determine the nitrate \n(Golterman et al. 1978), ammonia (Koroleff 1976) and \northophosphate (Strickland and Parsons 1960) concentrations. \nThe canopy openings were quantified using hemispherical \nphotographs taken with a digital camera equipped with a fish-eye \nlens. These photographs were later analyzed using Gap Light \nAnalyzer software (2.0). The leaves were washed with tap water \nin a 120 \u00b5 m mesh sieve. The invertebrates retained on the sieve \nwere preserved in 70% alcohol for later identification and \ncounting (P\u00e9rez 1988; Merritt and Cummins 1996). The numbers \nof taxa and individuals were calculated for the aquatic \ninvertebrate community, and biomass was obtained by \ndesiccation at 60\u00b0C for 72 h. The invertebrates were classified \ninto five feeding categories (P\u00e9rez 1988; Cummins et al. 2005; \nMerritt and Cummins 1996): gathering-collectors (G-C), \nfiltering-collectors (F-C), shredders (Sh), scrapers (Sc) and \npredators (P).  \n\nFive leaves from each sample were randomly collected, \nand three disks (1.2 cm diameter) were extracted from each leaf, \nresulting in three five-disk sets. One set was used to determine \nthe remaining ash-free dry mass (AFDM; calculated after \nincineration in a muffle furnace at 550\u00b0C for 4 h), and the other \nsets were used to assess the ergosterol and ATP concentrations. \nThe remaining material was oven-dried at 60\u00b0C for 72 h to \ndetermine its dry weight. The leaf breakdown rates (k) were \ncalculated using the negative exponential model of percent mass \nlost over time (Wt =W0e\n\n-kt; Wt = remaining weight; W0 = initial \nweight; -k = decay rate; t = time). After the leaves had been dried \nand weighed, they were pulverized for further analysis of the \n\n\n\n100 \n \n\ntotal polyphenol and tannic acid concentration (B\u00e4rlocher and \nGra\u00e7a 2005), lignin and cellulose contents (Gessner 2005b) and \nthe resistance of leaves to rupture (hardness of intact leaves \n(Gra\u00e7a et al. 2005)). Values for total nitrogen were obtained \nusing a CHN basic analyzer (Carlo Erba 1500 for WI; Thermo \nElectron Corp. Milan, Italy), and values for total phosphorus \nwere obtained using the ascorbic acid method after acid \ndigestion. The total micro-organism biomass was measured by \nquantifying ATP (Abelho 2005). The biomass of aquatic \nHyphomycetes was evaluated by quantifying ergosterol, a lipid \nexclusive to fungal membranes in this community (Gessner \n2005a).  \n \nData Analysis \n\nAn analysis of variance (function lm, package stats for R \nversion 2.12.1; (Crawley 2007)) was used to analyze the physical \nand chemical parameters of the water (temperature, electrical \nconductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, nitrites, nitrates, \northophosphates and mean velocity) and the structure of stream \nstretches (instantaneous discharge of the stream and canopy \nopenings in riparian vegetation) as dependent variables, using \ntwo categorical factors, namely, sub-basins and stream order . \nStream order was also used as a co-variate (continuous variable). \nWe also used the leaf mass remaining, invertebrate communities \n(number of taxa, density and biomass), the relative abundance of \nfunctional trophic groups of invertebrates (gathering-collectors, \nfiltering-collectors, shredders, scrapers and predators) and \nmicrobial biomass (ATP and ergosterol) as dependent variables \nagainst the same two categorical factors. Stream order was also \nused as a co-variate (continuous variable). This procedure was \nperformed similarly for both types of detritus. All models used a \nGaussian distribution (link = log; test = F). We used an analysis \nof contrasts to discriminate among categorical variables. The \nnormality of the data was tested using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov \ntest, the homogeneity of variance was determined with a Levene \ntest, and the data were transformed whenever necessary with the \nNaperian logarithm (ln) to obtain the best fit (Crawley 2007).  \n\n\n\n101 \n \n\nRESULTS \n\nAbiotic Variables \nThe values of instantaneous discharge, electrical \n\nconductivity and nitrates were the highest in the 3rd and 4th order \nstreams. In contrast, the 1st order streams had the highest values \nfor temperature, canopy opening and nitrite concentrations in the \nwater, and the water velocity was the lowest. Dissolved oxygen, \npH, turbidity and orthophosphates did not differ among the \nstream orders (analysis of contrasts, p &lt;0.05; Table S1, Table 1, \nFigure 2). In sub-basin 2 (SB2), we observed high electrical \nconductivity, high nitrite and nitrate concentrations and low \nwater temperatures. The values for canopy opening and water \nvelocity were highest in sub-basins 1 (SB1) and 4 (SB4), \nrespectively. Dissolved oxygen and orthophosphates were \nhighest in sub-basin 3 (SB3). Instantaneous discharge, pH and \nturbidity did not differ among the sub-basins (analysis of \ncontrasts, p &lt;0.05; Table S1, Figure 2). We observed that the \nhigher percentages of sums of squares and variance in \ninstantaneous discharge and water velocity could be explained by \ndifferences in the stream order. However, dissolved oxygen, \nelectrical conductivity, temperature, pH, turbidity, canopy \nopening, nitrates, nitrites and orthophosphates exhibited a high \nlevel of variance among the sub-basins (Table 1). \n\n \n\n\n\n102 \n \n\n \nFigure 2. Abiotic variables. Mean values and standard errors for dissolved oxygen \n(A), water velocity (B), water temperature (C) and canopy opening (D) for the stream \norders and among sub-basins. \n\n \nLeaf Breakdown Rates \n\nThe leaf breakdown rates (k) were the highest in the 2nd \norder streams, with values of -0.0083 and -0.0022 for E. \ncloeziana and I. laurina, respectively, followed by the 3rd order \nstream sections, with values of -0.0071 and -0.0022. We also \nobserved higher k values in 1st order streams (-0.0053 and -\n0.0015) than in 4th order streams (-0.0051 and -0.0018) for E. \ncloeziana and I. laurina, respectively. However, the remaining \nmass did not differ among stream orders for either of the detritus \ntypes (Figure S2, Table 2, Figure 3A and 4A). The highest k \nvalues were observed in SB4 (-0.0105 and -0.0030), followed by \nSB3 (-0.0088 and -0.0022 for E. cloeziana and I. laurina, \nrespectively). For E. cloeziana, the values were -0.0062 and -\n0.0049, whereas I. laurina exhibited values of -0.0018 and -\n0.0016 (for SB1 and SB2, respectively). The remaining mass \nshowed the lowest values in SB4 and SB3 among the sub-basins \nstudied. The variance in the remaining mass was higher (by sums \nof squares) and also explained the variations in the sub-basins \n(Figure S2, Table 2, Figure 3A and 4A). \n\n\n\n103 \n \n\n \nFigure 3.

Differences for I. laurina \nwere observed among sub-basins, with high values in SB3 (mean \n24 ind/g) and SB4 (mean 26 ind/g). The number of taxa was \nsignificantly different among the stream orders and sub-basins, \nwith the highest values in SB3 (mean of 7 and 6 taxa for E. \ncloeziana and I. laurina, respectively) and SB4 (mean of 6 taxa \nfor E. cloeziana and I. laurina), primarily in 3rd order streams for \nboth detritus types (mean of 7 and 6 taxa for E. cloeziana and I. \nlaurina, respectively). However, the biomass (total mean 0.003 \nand 0.002 ind/g for E. cloeziana and I. laurina, respectively) did \nnot differ among the stream orders or sub-basins for either of the \ndetritus types. The high variances in density, richness and \nbiomass (in terms of the percentage of the sums of squares) were \nexplained by differences in the sub-basins for both detritus types, \nexcept for the density of invertebrates in I. laurina (Figure S3 \nand S4, Table 2). \n\nThe functional trophic groups differed significantly \namong stream orders only for the filtering-collectors, with the \nhighest values in the 3rd order streams (mean 20% for E. \ncloeziana and I. laurina) and the lowest in the 1st order streams \n(mean of 10% for E. cloeziana and I. laurina) for both detritus \ntypes. The relative abundance of predators was higher in SB3 \n(mean 24 and 25% for E. cloeziana and I. laurina, respectively) \nand SB4 (mean of 32 and 34% for E. cloeziana and I. laurina, \nrespectively), whereas the values for shredders were higher in \nSB3 (mean of 27 and 25% for E. cloeziana and I. laurina, \nrespectively) for both detritus types. However, SB1 exhibited \nhigh abundances of gathering-collectors (mean of 41 and 50% \nfor E. cloeziana and I. laurina, respectively) and scrapers (mean \nof 18 and 16% for E. cloeziana and I. laurina, respectively) but a \nlow abundance of filtering-collectors (mean of 6 and 8% for E. \ncloeziana and I. laurina, respectively) for both detritus types. \nThe high variance in the relative abundance for all functional \ntrophic groups (by the sums of squares) was also explained by \n\n\n\n107 \n \n\nchanges in sub-basins for both detritus types (Figure S3 and S4, \nTable 2, Figure 3B and 4B).  \n\nThe ATP values differed only among sub-basins for both \ndetritus types, with the highest values in SB3 (mean of 2155.8 \nnmoles/g AFDM) for E. cloeziana (total mean 991.8 nmoles/g \nAFDM) and in SB3 (mean 633.3 nmoles/g AFDM) and SB4 \n(mean 2023.9 nmoles/g AFDM) for I. laurina (total mean 847.8 \nnmoles/g AFDM) (Table 2; Fig. 2C and 3C). There were no \ndifferences in the ergosterol concentrations among the \nhydrological stream orders and sub-basins for E. cloeziana (total \nmean 541.2 ug/g). However, we found higher ergosterol \nconcentrations for I. laurina (total mean 382.9 ug/g) in SB3 \n(mean 392.6 ug/g) and SB4 (mean 464.1 ug/g), although they did \nnot differ among the hydrological stream orders. The variances \nin ATP and ergosterol concentrations were also explained by \nchanges in sub-basins for both detritus types, except for \nergosterol in E. cloeziana, which showed a high level of \nvariation with stream order (Figure S3 and S4, Table 2, Figure \n3D and 4D). \n \n\n\n\n108 \n \n\nTable 1. Degrees of freedom (DF), residuals, sums of squares (%), F tests and \nanalyses of variance and contrasts (AC) for dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, \nwater temperature, pH, turbidity, water velocity, canopy openness and nitrites, \nnitrates and orthophosphates in sub-basins and along the stream orders in the Gama-\nCabe\u00e7a de Veado Basin.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n109 \n \n\nDISCUSSION \n\nScale Analysis \nThe instantaneous discharge, water velocity, turbidity \n\nand nitrogen series (nitrate and nitrite) were more influenced by \nchanges in stream order (high heterogeneity), with higher values \ndownstream (increasing from 1st to 4th order), as expected \naccording to Vannote et al. (Vannote et al. 1980), except that \nnitrites exhibited the inverse pattern. The finding of relatively \nfew influences at local scales can be explained by the large \ndiscontinuities inherent in smaller geomorphological units \n(habitat patches create discontinuities in space) that increase the \npotential influence from the local characteristics of the \nenvironment (Benda et al. 2004; Larned et al. 2010; Wiens 1989; \nWiens 2002). Flow changes, for example, create hydrological \ndiscontinuities along stream corridors and isolate habitats. \nHowever, the other abiotic variables were influenced by changes \nin sub-basins (high homogeneity) that correspond to regional \nscales (Allen and Starr 1982; Frissell et al. 1986). These factors \nworked at the watershed level and may increase its fragility in \nthe face of intense climatic changes because the climate is the \nprimary controlling factor at large scales (Allan 2004). The \nbasins are influenced by environmental factors that \nsystematically change across longitudinal \n(upstream/downstream), vertical (sediment/water) and lateral \n(terrestrial/aquatic) gradients, forming different spatial and \ntemporal patterns at regional and local scales (Larned et al. 2010; \nSchneider 2001; Wiens 2002). \n\nAs expected, the high-quality detritus (E. cloeziana) \nshowed more rapid leaf breakdown rates (k) than the low-quality \n(I. laurina) detritus, indicating that the rate could be driven by \nmicro-scale processes (Wiens 1989). These findings represent \nimportant evidence that the riparian vegetation could be \nresponsible for determining the ecosystem characteristics \n(Cummins 1974; Naiman and D\u00e9camps 1997; Petersen and \n\n\n\n110 \n \n\nCummins 1974), as also proposed by Gon\u00e7alves et al. \n(Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2012b) for tropical systems, highlighting the \nneed to study this vegetation. For example, if riparian vegetation \nis composed of plant species that have a higher stoichiometric \nratio (higher quality), we expect more rapid response for organic \nmatter cycling (higher decomposition). This direct relationship \nbetween terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems demonstrates that any \nmodification in a riparian ecosystem would affect the function, \nprimarily in areas composed of palatable plants (high quality and \ndecomposition), corroborating the work of Frauendorf et al. \n(Frauendorf et al. 2013). Thus, lower quality vegetation (slower \ndecomposition) will be less sensitive to other factors, and this \nmay explain the resistance of the Brazilian savanna in \ncomparison with other Brazilian tropical systems (Carvalho et al. \n2009). Moreover, the leaf breakdown at the macro-scale was \nmore influenced by the regional scale (sub-basin) than by the \nlocal scale (stream order) (Wiens 1989), confirming our \nhypothesis. This result indicates that the patterns observed in \nstudies covering a given time period (timely studies), common in \ntropical literature (for more see also (Bianchini_Jr. 1999; \nGon\u00e7alves et al. 2013)), cannot be generalized from local to \nregional scales (Bae et al. 2011; Schneider 2001; Young and \nCollier 2009) or to whole watersheds (Lowe et al. 2006; Tiegs et \nal. 2009; Wiens 1989; Wiens 2002). In addition, this finding may \nindicate fragility in the upstream basins due to the slower leaf \nbreakdown rates. However, the upstream area is a source of \nnutrients and organisms for the downstream basins (Vannote et \nal. 1980). The upstream basins can give support productivity and \nmay be responsible for extending the depuration capability of the \nsystem (as represented by the microbial pools) and maintaining \nfunctionality downstream (Frauendorf et al. 2013). Therefore, we \nbelieve that the association between detritus quality (important at \nthe micro-scale) and the environmental features of the watershed \n(important at the macro-scale) is responsible for shaping organic \nmatter cycling in the watershed and should be further \ninvestigated in future studies. \n\n\n\n111 \n \n\nPrevious studies indicating that the microbial \ncommunity is the principal decomposer (Cummins 1974; \nGessner et al. 1999; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2012b), are confirmed by \nour results, as we found that the high-quality leaf species was \nalso more susceptible to leaching and microbial action, whereas \nthe low-quality leaf species was influenced primarily by fungal \ncolonization. Both leaf samples were consumed by shredders, but \na higher abundance of shredders was observed in the E. \ncloeziana detritus. We also found a higher loss of mass due to the \nhigh water velocity (mechanical fragmentation and leaching), \ndissolved oxygen and temperatures, which accelerate biological \nmetabolism (Gulis and Suberkropp 2003; Medeiros et al. 2009). \nThe detritus quality is important only for defining the local rates \nand their pathways for leaf breakdown (Ardon and Pringle 2008; \nGessner et al. 1999; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2012b). However, the \ndetritus quality has little influence on the general pattern along \nthe \u201criverscape\u201d and at any specific scale (Tiegs et al. 2009). \nTherefore, based on an analysis of the samples after a certain \npercentage of mass has been lost (25, 75 and 50%) and not \nsimply at predefined time points (e.g., 7, 15, 30 days), it is \npossible to show a clear colonization effect independent of \nquality. To be sure, detritus quality is a highly important \ndeterminant of the abundance of shredders and explains the \nimportance of shredders for both detritus types (Gon\u00e7alves et al. \n2012a). We cannot study the variations associated with spatial \nscale in terms only of the local context because there are many \nfactors in the ecological levels (community and ecosystem) that \nare responsible for variability found in the large scale (Wiens \n2002; Young and Collier 2009). However, the local approach has \nbeen used in all previous tropical studies of leaf breakdown \n(Abelho 2001; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2013).  \n \nLeaf Breakdown Rates \n\nIn agreement with the proposal of Gon\u00e7alves et al. \n(Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2013) for tropical systems, the k values of E. \ncloeziana were classified as intermediate (-0.0173 > k > -\n0.0041), and those of I. laurina were classified as slow (k &lt;-\n\n\n\n112 \n \n\n0.0041) for all sampling sites, indicating a strong influence of \ndetritus quality. The high leaching due to the high solubility of \npolyphenols and tannins (secondary compounds) in E. cloeziana \ncan accelerate the decay rate (Ardon and Pringle 2008; Ardon et \nal. 2006). Therefore, the rapid leaching of these secondary \ncompounds, which has an inhibitory effect on detritivores, as \nwell as the lower hardness of E. cloeziana, did not limit biotic \ncolonization due to the low residence time in this type of detritus \n(Ardon and Pringle 2008; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2012b). Additionally, \nEucalyptus sp. (an exotic species) is rapidly colonized and \ndecomposed in the Brazilian savannah. It is possible that this \npattern is due to the high quality of Eucalyptus relative to native \nspecies (Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2012a; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2012b; \nOliveira-Filho and Ratter 1994).  \n\nIn contrast, we found lower breakdown rates for I. \nlaurina which were most likely a consequence of a high content \nof structural compounds (lignin and cellulose) and relative \nhardness (cuticle thickness), hindering the release of other \nchemical compounds (e.g., polyphenols, nitrogen and \nphosphorus (Ardon et al. 2006; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2012b; Oliveira-\nFilho and Ratter 1994)). Therefore, the chemical characteristics \nof detritus determine the speed of processing (primarily at local \nscales), showing that leaf breakdown rates increase with quality \nand palatability (Gessner et al. 1999; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2012a; \nGon\u00e7alves et al. 2012b; Gra\u00e7a et al. 2001). Detritus quality is of \nlower importance when if it is observed at different scales. In the \nstudy area, we observed that the regional scale is decisive for \ndriving the general pattern of this important ecological process \nalong the \u201criverscapes\u201d (Allan 2004; Frissell et al. 1986). \n \nAbiotic and Biotic Variables in Leaf Breakdown \n\nThe natural environmental changes that occur across \nstream orders (Benda et al. 2004) were not sufficient to modify \nthe remaining mass, and the local scale could not affect the \ndecomposer communities (shredders and microorganisms) for \neither of the detritus types. Decomposer communities are the \ndriving factors for leaf breakdown, and their absence leads to \n\n\n\n113 \n \n\nsimilar breakdown patterns along the stream order gradient \n(Gessner et al. 1999). This finding might indicate that ecological \nfunctioning in headwater streams (1st to 3rd order) was similar \nwithin the same sub-basin (Vannote et al. 1980) . However, this \nprocess might change over a large spatial gradient, as represented \nby the sub-basin scale (Allan 2004). Nevertheless, increases in \nrichness and the density of invertebrates and a decrease in the \nabundance of filtering-collectors for both detritus types were \nobserved across this large spatial gradient. These results \ndemonstrate that these variables had no effect on leaf breakdown \n(Cummins et al. 2005; Merritt and Cummins 1996).  \n\nThe values of the remaining mass for both detritus types \nwere lower in SB4 and SB3 (high decomposition) than in the \nother sub-basins. It is probable that the reason for this difference \nwas the higher temperatures, dissolved oxygen concentrations \nand water velocities resulting from the microclimate of the \ngeographic location (within a valley). Therefore, the higher \ntemperatures (Gulis and Suberkropp 2003) and oxygen \nconcentrations (Medeiros et al. 2009) observed in SB4 and SB3 \nmay elevate the metabolic activity of the decomposer community \n(Suberkropp and Chauvet 1995), especially microorganisms. The \nhigher metabolic activity of the decomposer community, \nassociated with high water velocity (mechanical fragmentation \nand leaching), which increased the degree of physical abrasion \n(Santos Fonseca et al. 2012), accelerated the leaf breakdown \nrates. In SB4 and SB3, higher density and richness of \ninvertebrates and higher shredder abundance, with the greatest \ndensities in E. cloeziana, were also observed. The shredders \ndirectly utilize leaf tissues for feeding, and increasing biological \nfragmentation (Boyero et al. 2012; Gra\u00e7a et al. 2001) can also \naccelerate the leaf breakdown rates (Sponseller and Benfield \n2001). Certain shredders in these locations (genus Phylloicus) \ncan build their capsules from leaf tissue, and this use of leaf \nmaterial also contributes to fragmentation (Cummins et al. 2005; \nMerritt and Cummins 1996).  \n\nThe relative abundance of shredders was influenced by \nvariation, primarily among the sub-basins. A greater relative \n\n\n\n114 \n \n\nabundance of shredders in comparison with other tropical \nsystems was observed in SB3 for both detritus types (Boyero et \nal. 2012; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2012a; Wantzen and Wagner 2006). A \nlow relative abundance of shredders was found in the other sub-\nbasins. This result is consistent with the findings of previous \nstudies in the Cerrado (Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2007; Gon\u00e7alves et al. \n2012a; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2013). The importance of shredders for \nleaf breakdown is unclear in the tropics due to their low \nabundance or absence in these streams (Boyero et al. 2012; \nGon\u00e7alves et al. 2012a; Wantzen and Wagner 2006), but studies \nhave shown little effect in tropical streams (Moretti et al. 2007; \nMoulton et al. 2010). From a global perspective, the strong \neffects observed in the current study were most likely due to the \npreference of shredders (primarily Trichoptera and Plecoptera) \nfor high altitudes (due to the lower temperatures) in tropical \nregions (Boyero et al. 2012). The preference of this group for E. \ncloeziana indicates that detritus quality is also important \n(Wantzen and Wagner 2006) and that the composition of the \nvegetation influences the functioning of aquatic systems. \nTherefore, higher altitudes (low temperature (Boyero et al. \n2012)), high dissolved oxygen, the composition of the flora \n(ideally including E. cloeziana (Wantzen and Wagner 2006)) and \nmoderate values of nutrient concentrations in the water (Bae et \nal. 2011) favor a high abundance of shredders. The \npredominance in the Cerrado of leaves that are low in nutrients \n(Oliveira-Filho and Ratter 1994), is associated with hydric and \nthermic stress and could be responsible for the absence or low \nabundance of shredders found in most tropical streams (Boyero \net al. 2012; Wantzen and Wagner 2006).  \n\nThe high-quality detritus (E. cloeziana) was shown to be \nmost influenced by the total microbial community and the low-\nquality detritus (I. laurina) by the fungal community in SB4 and \nSB3 (high decomposition). E. cloeziana has elevated amounts of \nlabile compounds, facilitating the activity of bacteria (rapid life \ncycles) that use compounds derived from the leaching of the \nleaves of labile detritus as their preferred resource (Weyers and \nSuberkropp 1996). These bacteria could be important during leaf \n\n\n\n115 \n \n\nbreakdown and not only, as observed by several authors, at the \nearly stages of the process (Gessner et al. 1999; Gon\u00e7alves et al. \n2012b; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2013). However, this pattern is rarely \nobserved in tropical streams. In lower-quality detritus (I. \nlaurina), we observed an interaction between the biomass of the \ntwo microbial communities, highlighting fungi as the principal \ncomponent (Gulis and Suberkropp 2003). Due to its high \ncapacity to metabolize refractory molecules (e.g., cellulose and \nlignin) and to decompose them, the fungal community is the \nprimary decomposer in tropical streams, and this principle \nexplains the great significance of fungi in I. laurina \ndecomposition (Gessner et al. 1999; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2012b; \nWeyers and Suberkropp 1996). Fungal action can increase the \npalatability of detritus, as well as its nutritional quality, for other \ndecomposers, and the high biomass of fungi might be another \nfactor responsible for the higher abundance of shredders in these \nsub-basins (Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2012b; Gra\u00e7a et al. 2001).  \n\nIn general, we conclude that variations in scale \ncontribute to the variation in the leaf breakdown rate, \nhighlighting the importance of similar studies of this type that \ndetermine effects at different scales. The variability of the \nphysical structure of streams (primarily temperature, dissolved \noxygen and nutrients) accelerates leaf breakdown from upstream \nto downstream, but this process was only demonstrated at the \nsub-basin scale in the location studied, partially corroborating the \ninitial hypothesis. The replacement of shredder invertebrates by \nmicroorganisms was observed but was contrary to the prediction \nof our hypothesis. Shredders were favored by microorganisms \n(primarily in E. cloeziana), with stronger interactions between \nthem than those previously found to drive leaf breakdown rates. \nBased on our interest in the influence of spatial structure on \necosystem functions, we observed that watersheds with warmer \nmicroclimates and streams with higher nutrient levels and \noxygen in the water could be accelerating the metabolism of the \necosystem in the watershed, with increased negative effects \ndownstream. For the management of tropical watersheds, we \nnoted that the upstream areas are more fragile and sensitive to \n\n\n\n116 \n \n\nenvironmental impacts but show greater importance in the \ncycling of nutrients. We performed analyses within and between \nspatial scales to assess the relative importance of various \nwatershed scales in determining the local breakdown rate for \nleaves. Local characteristics are responsible for the \ndiversification of this process across the \u201criverscape\u201d, and high \nheterogeneity underscores the difficulty of making predictions \nbased on local studies. \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nThe first author also received a scholarship from CAPES during \nhis PhD research in the Graduate Program in Ecology of UFSC. \nWe are also grateful to C\u00e1ssia Alves Lima for valuable logistical \nsupport for the field and laboratory work. \n \nREFERENCES \nAbelho M (2001) From litterfall to breakdown in streams: a \n\nreview Scientific World Journal 1:656-680 \ndoi:10.1100/tsw.2001.103 \n\nAbelho M (2005) Extraction and quantification of ATP as a \nmeasure of microbial biomass.

Isso pode ser um passo importante para \nproduzir modelos matem\u00e1ticos capazes de prever as taxas \nde decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o a partir de caracter\u00edsticas ambientais \nsimples. \n\nA varia\u00e7\u00e3o temporal modifica a resposta da \ndecomposi\u00e7\u00e3o foliar em sistemas l\u00f3ticos, com menores \ntaxas na seca e maiores no in\u00edcio das chuvas. Assim, como \na maioria dos trabalhos realizados em regi\u00e3o \ntropical/Cerrado ocorreram na seca, tornando as tentativas \nde tra\u00e7ar padr\u00f5es gerais pouco realistas e subestimadas. A \nvaria\u00e7\u00e3o temporal permite maiores picos de entrada de \nmat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica (setembro e outubro) no final do per\u00edodo \nda seca. Entretanto, observou-se a exist\u00eancia de um  \u201ctime \nlag\u201d com o pico de decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o (dezembro), indicando a \npossibilidade de prever ambos os picos atrav\u00e9s do regime \nclim\u00e1tico (temperatura e pluviosidade). Outro aspecto \u00e9 \nque temporalmente os sistemas rip\u00e1rios estudados \napresentaram uma maior instabilidade no processo de \ndecomposi\u00e7\u00e3o e par\u00e2metros f\u00edsicos e qu\u00edmicos da \u00e1gua nos \nmeses de transi\u00e7\u00e3o, entre os per\u00edodos de seca e chuva. No \nper\u00edodo de seca foi observado maiores densidade e riqueza \nde invertebrados, biomassa de micro-organismo. \nEntretanto, no per\u00edodo chuvoso foi observado maiores \ntaxas de decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o, possivelmente em fun\u00e7\u00e3o das \nelevadas temperaturas, que pode acelerar o metabolismo \ndas comunidades decompositoras. \n\nSobre o funcionamento de veredas, verificamos \nque  apesar de apresentar um solo muito org\u00e2nico, este \nsistema apresenta baixa produtividade, possivelmente, em \nfun\u00e7\u00e3o de elevada capacidade de reten\u00e7\u00e3o de mat\u00e9ria \n\n\n\n129 \n \n\norg\u00e2nica associado a baixa capacidade de transporte destas \n\u00e1reas. Outro aspecto \u00e9 que em fun\u00e7\u00e3o dos pulsos de \ninunda\u00e7\u00e3o (seca e chuva), o r\u00e1pido acumulo e \nempilhamento de mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica, pode gerar um \nambiente com baixa concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de oxig\u00eanio, e assim \ndesacelerar a decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o nestas camadas mais \nprofundas, comparadas as superficiais (alta decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o \nno extrato mais superficial da serapilheira). Isso pode \nexplicar o solo rico em humos nos extratos mais profundos \ndo solo das veredas. \n\nO impacto sobre a remo\u00e7\u00e3o parcial do dossel da \nvegeta\u00e7\u00e3o nativa (extrativismo vegetal) afetou par\u00e2metros \nbi\u00f3ticos (invertebrados e micro-organismos) e abi\u00f3ticos \n(par\u00e2metros f\u00edsicos e qu\u00edmicos da \u00e1gua) associados a \ndecomposi\u00e7\u00e3o indicando que este processo \u00e9 \u00fatil na \navalia\u00e7\u00e3o de impactos ambientais. Estudos mostram que a \nvegeta\u00e7\u00e3o nativa pode funcionar como uma zona de \nprote\u00e7\u00e3o, mantendo constante o micro clima em \u00e1reas \nriparias (menor varia\u00e7\u00e3o na luminosidade, temperatura e \numidade), e sua remo\u00e7\u00e3o interrompe essa prote\u00e7\u00e3o natural \ndeixando o sistema mais suscet\u00edveis as mudan\u00e7as sazonais. \nEste fato pode explicar o aumentando a frequ\u00eancia e \nintensidade das mudan\u00e7as ambientais com retirada da \nvegeta\u00e7\u00e3o nativa, consequentemente, elevando a amplitude \nsobre os par\u00e2metros bi\u00f3ticos e abi\u00f3ticos observados no \nnosso estudo.  \n\nQuando avaliado as diferentes escalas, se \nobservou maior explica\u00e7\u00e3o da vari\u00e2ncia das taxas de \ndecomposi\u00e7\u00e3o foliar, vari\u00e1veis bi\u00f3ticas e abi\u00f3ticas \nrelacionadas a este processo pela escala regional, \nindependente do tipo de detrito. A variabilidade da \nestrutura f\u00edsica nos sistemas l\u00f3ticos (principalmente \ntemperatura, oxig\u00eanio e nutrientes dissolvidos) podem \natuar diretamente acelerando o metabolismo das \ncomunidades decompositoras e, consequentemente a \ndecomposi\u00e7\u00e3o. Assim, os resultados obtidos a partir de um \nponto amostral n\u00e3o permitem generaliza\u00e7\u00f5es para toda a \n\n\n\n130 \n \n\nbacia. Para estudos de ordem hidrol\u00f3gica a n\u00edvel de bacia \nhidrogr\u00e1fica \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio r\u00e9plicas de rios em diferentes \nsub-bacias de mesma ordem, em fun\u00e7\u00e3o do gradiente \ncrescente na taxa de decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o de montante para \njusante na bacia hidrogr\u00e1fica. Isso pode ser explicado pelo \naumento da temperatura e biomassa de micro-organismos e \nabundancia de invertebrados fragmentadores ao longo \ndeste gradiente.  \n\n\n\n131 \n \n\nPESPECTIVAS FUTURAS \nOs seguintes t\u00f3picos s\u00e3o recomendados para \n\nserem avaliados em experimentos futuros: \n1. Buscar padr\u00f5es de produtividade dos ecossistemas \n\naqu\u00e1ticos e zonas rip\u00e1rias tropicais e verificar \ncomo os gradientes (longitudinais e latitudinais) \nde produtividade podem influenciar a \ndecomposi\u00e7\u00e3o foliar em sistemas l\u00f3ticos tropicais.  \n\n2. Estimar as taxas de reten\u00e7\u00e3o e transporte de \nmat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica ao longo da din\u00e2mica sazonal em \nambientes tropicais e sua influencia sobre a \ndecomposi\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\n3. Avaliar como outras formas de impacto ou \naltera\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental modificam o processo de \ndecomposi\u00e7\u00e3o foliar em sistemas l\u00f3ticos tropicais. \n\n4. Produzir mecanismos de valora\u00e7\u00e3o do processo de \ndecomposi\u00e7\u00e3o, considerando os servi\u00e7os e \npreju\u00edzos em fun\u00e7\u00e3o de atividade antr\u00f3pica.  \n\n5. Investir na decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o como uma ferramenta \nde biomonitoramento, ajudando a determinar \nfatores e mecanismos respons\u00e1veis pela resist\u00eancia \ndos ecossistemas aqu\u00e1ticos \u00e0s perturba\u00e7\u00f5es \nexternas.  \n\n6. Ampliar estudos que abordem como a estrutura \nespacial dos ecossistemas aqu\u00e1ticos tropicais pode \ninfluenciar os processos ecol\u00f3gicos, como a \ndecomposi\u00e7\u00e3o foliar. \n\n7. Verificar a import\u00e2ncia dos fatores ambientais e / \nou espaciais sobre a biodiversidade (alfa e beta) da \ncomunidade decompositora e, consequentemente, \ncomo esta varia\u00e7\u00e3o pode alterar as taxas de \ndecomposi\u00e7\u00e3o foliar em sistemas l\u00f3ticos. \n\n8. Entender o padr\u00e3o de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos \nfragmentadores em sistemas tropicais e explicar \nsua baixa participa\u00e7\u00e3o na decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o quando \ncomparado a sistemas temperados. \n\n\n\n132 \n \n\n9. Produzir modelos matem\u00e1ticos a partir da \ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o de caracter\u00edsticas simples, como por \nexemplo, composi\u00e7\u00e3o da vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o rip\u00e1ria, \ntemperatura e precipita\u00e7\u00e3o que sejam capazes de \nprever taxas de decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o."}]}}}
