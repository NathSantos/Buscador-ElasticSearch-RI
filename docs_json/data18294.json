The analysed samples present low ,47Sm/,44Nd values (0.105-0.119) and negative eNd^ values (-3.9 to -12.4), which suggest a typical upper continental crust provenance. These results of Ediacaran-Early Cambrian Ossa-Morena Zone rocks are close to those obtained for the Saxo-Thuringian Zone (Germany) correlatives.\nKey-words: Rb-Sr; Sm-Nd, Ediacaran-Early Cambrian, TIMS, Gondwana\nIntroduction\nIsotope geochemistry has been used to identify the different isotopic reservoirs in the crust and the mantle and to characterize the sources of igneous and sedimentary rocks [1]. In this radiogenic isotope study we used two different systems: Rb-Sr, and Sm-Nd, to characterize detrital sedimentary rocks.\nSr reflects fairly close the original bulk composition of rocks, although Rb is more mobile. Sr and Rb are strongly fractionated from one another between crust and the mantle leading to the accelerated Sr isotope evolution of continental crust relative to the mantle.\nSm and Nd isotopes are not significantly fractionated within continental crust by sedimentary processes and thus preserve the characteristics of their source (e.g. [2]).\nThe Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotopic characterization has been applied to test correlations between old sediments from basins separated in nowdays by several kilometers due to post-Variscan tectonics 13].\nGeological setting and sample selection\nIn the northern domains of the Ossa-Morena Zone (OMZ) close to the Central-Iberian Zone (CIZ)\nboundary (Northeast Alentejo, Portugal) outcrops the Serie Negra Cadomian succession [4-5], which is composed by Ediacaran metapelites, metagreywackes, black metacherts and metabasalts (Mosteiros Formation). Early Cambrian calc-alkaline volcanic-sedimentary and detritic-carbonate complexes unconformably overlie the Serie Negra. They represent a sequence of reworked felsic tuffs, andesites, rhyodacites and rhyolites (Nave de Grou-Azeiteiros volcanic-sedimentary complex) that passes to the top to arkosic sandstones and pelites and then to limestones (Assumar detritic-carbonate complex) [6-7],\nThe selected sample from Ediacaran was taken from a Serie Negra outcrop at North of Alter do Ch\u00e3o (CTO-200). The Early Cambrian rocks were sampled from the felsic-dominated volcanic-sedimentary complex of Nave de Grou-Azeiteiros at North of Ouguela (OGL-1) and the detritic-carbonate complex of Assumar in the same crosssection where was taken the Serie Negra sample (CTO-2).\n[6], have studied the geochemistry of such rocks recently. There are no main differences in major elements between these detrital rocks, but there is an increasing tendency for the AI2O3/S\u00cdO2 values from the metagrywacke (CTO-200:\t0.19), the\npelite/reworked andesitic tuff (CTO-2: 0.29) and the arkose (OGL-): 0.41). The chondrite-normalized REE distribution patterns are similar with a characteristic negative Eu-anomaly, a clear enrichment of the LREE relative to HREE (CTO-200: La,/Ybn= 21.3; CTO-2: Lan/Yba= 10.46; OGL-1: Lan/Ybn= 16.8). The chondrite-normalized incompatible trace element patterns show negative anomalies of Nb, Sr and Sm and enrichments of Th, La, Ce, Nd and Zr. The REE abundance distributions normalized with respect to PAAS are unfractionated with nearly fiat patterns characterized by a slightly positive Eu-anomaly.\nTheir calc-alkaline signature and felsic provenance indicate that the source of these rocks was a recycled Cadomian continental magmatic arc [7].\nAnalytical procedures\nThree samples (CTO-2, OGL-1 and CTO-200) were selected for the study of St and Nd isotopes.\nThe samples were dissolved with HF/HNO3 solution in Teflon Parr acid digestion bombs at 180\u00b0C of temperature. After evaporation of the final solution, the samples were dissolved with HC1 (6N) and dry. The elements to analyse were purified using conventional ion chromatography technique in two stages: 1) separation of Sr and REE elements in ion exchange column with AG8 50W Bio-Rad cation exchange resin; 2) purification of Nd from others lanthanides elements in columns with Ln Resin (ElChroM Technologies) cation exchange resin.\nAll the intervenient reagents in the preparation of the samples were distillate two times, and the water\nproduced by a Milli-Q Element (Millipore) apparatus.\nThe isotopic analysis were carried out at the Laboratorio de Geolog\u00eda isot\u00f3pica da Universidade de Aveiro (LGI-UA), Portugal. Sr was loaded on a single Ta filament with H3PO4 (IN), whereas Nd was loaded on a Ta outer side filament, with HC1 (2,5N), in a Ta-Re-Ta triple arrangement with Re as the ionizing central filament. Both elements were determined using a Multi-Collector Thermal Ionisation Mass Spectrometer (TIMS) VG Sector 54 with 7 Faraday cups. Data were acquired ai multidynamic mode with peak measurements at 1-2V to \u201cSr and 0,8-l,5V to 144Nd. The measurements of Sr were corrected for possible interference bj *7Rb and were normalized to 88Sr/86Sr=0.1194. The measurements of Nd were corrected for interferenct by 142Ce and 144Sm and normalized t&lt;146Nd/144Nd=0.7219. During this study, the NBS-98' standard gave an average value fo: 87Sr/86Sr=0.710263\u00b110 (N=8; conf. lim.=95%) an&lt;143Nd/,44Nd=0.512114\u00b12 (N=27; conf. lim.=95%) tt JNdi-1 standard (145Nd/i44Nd data are normalized tt La Jolla standard). The error on eNd calculations i \u00b10.3.\nRb-Sr and Sm-Nd results\nRb-Sr and Sm-Nd results are reported in Table 1.\nTab. 1: Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd analytical data together with sNd (I for three clastic sedimentary rocks &amp;om OM7,.\nSample\tCTO-2\tOGL-1\tCTO-200\n\u2019\u2019RbAsr\t3.419\t11.651\t0.789\n\"'SrASr\t0.731820\t0.776305\t0,714828\n,i7Sm/l44Nd\t0.119\t0.118\t0.105\n,43Nd/lX4Nd\t0.512163\t0.511859\t0.511662\ncNd (0)\t-9.3\t-15.2\t-19.0\neNd (540)\t-3.9\t-9.7\t\neNd(560)\t\t\t-12.4\nThe 87Sr/86Sr values obtained from the three clash sedimentary rocks range from 0.714828 (CTO-200 to 0.731820 (CTO-2) and 0.776305 (OGL-1). Th 2o error range from 0.000035 to 0.000042.\nThe obtained 143Nd/,44Nd values show an increasin tendency from 0.511662 (CTO-200), to 0.51185 (OGL-1) and 0.512163 (CTO-2). The 2a error ran^ from 0.000012 to 0.000018.\nThis trend is followed by the 147Sm/144Nd value which range from 0.105 (CTO-200), to 0.118 (OGI l)and 0.119 (CTO-2).\nThe three samples display negative eNd values:\nFor 560 Ma -Ediacaran deposition age - CTO-201 metagreywacke, cNd(o)= -19.0 and eNd<560)= -12.4; For 540 Ma -Lower Cambrian deposition age OGL-1, reworked felsic tuffpelite, \u00a3Nd(0)= -15 and \u00a3Nd(54o)= -9.2.\nAnd for 540 Ma -Lower Cambrian deposition age CTO-2, arkose, eNd<o)= -9.3 and cNd^p -3.9.\nDiscussion\nThese three samples present low ,47Sm/l44Nd values (0.105-0.119), which suggest a typical upper continental crust provenance. The obtained results fit well with the Sr and Nd compositional ranges of Precambrian upper continental crust (87Sr/86Sr= 0.71463-0.78662 and 143Nd/,44Nd=\t0.511843-\n0.512261) and detrital rocks (87Sr/86Sr= 0.711440-0.78919 and I43Nd/144Nd= 0.511816-0.512259) from Southern Britain (e.g.[2, Table 6.6, pp.235-236]).\nThe obtained 87Sr/86Sr and i43Nd/144Nd values are in agreement with previous studies made by for detrital and volcanic Ediacaran-Early Cambrian rocks of the Ossa-Morena and Central-Iberian zones:\n-\t[8] on Early Cambrian OMZ arkoses (87Sr/86Sr= 0.754677 and l43Nd/J44Nd- 0.512149) and Ediacaran C1Z greywackes and pelites (^Sr/^St^ 0.735193; 143Nd/,44Nd= 0.512131-0.512172);\n-\t[9] on Ediacaran OMZ metapelites (87Sr/85Sr=\n0.742721-0.743536;\t143Nd/i44Nd=\t0.511976-\n0.512008) and Ediacaran-Early Cambrian CIZ metapelites and metagreywackes (87Sr/*6Sr= 0.736217-0.812759;\t143Nd/,44Nd=\t0.512217-\n0.512288);\n-\t[10] on Ediacaran-Early Cambrian CIZ pelites\n(87Sr/86Sr=\t0.72747-0.77767; l43Nd/l44Nd=\n0.511971-0.512272);\n-\t[11] on Early Cambrian OMZ pelites (143Nd/144Nd-0.512055-0.512129) and Early Cambrian OMZ andesites (143Nd/l44Nd- 0.512555-0.512745);\n-\t[12] on Ediacaran-Early Cambrian CIZ andesitic basalts (87Sr/86Sr=0.721888; ,43Nd/l44Nd= 0.511993) and Ediacaran-Early Cambrian CIZ dacitic volcaniclastic rocks (87Sr/86Sr= 0.712356-0.716902; l43Nd/144Nd= 0.512361-0.512310).\n-\t[13] on Neoproterozoic CIZ metasedimentary rocks (pelites) (87Sr/86Sr=0.73495-0.79l50; l45Nd/144Nd= 0.51213-0.51227)\nThe same similarity seems to be expressed on the equivalent age detrital rocks from the Saxo-Thuringian Zone (STZ, Germany; 87Sr/86Sr= 0.716690-0.786917;\t143Nd/!44Nd=0.511786-\n0.52248) (e.g. [14]).\nThis similarity is also expressed by the fact that the OMZ samples show negative eNd^ values (-3.9 to -12.4) are equivalent to the obtained results for the Ediacaran-Early Cambrian STZ correlatives with \u00a3Nd(Tj values ranging from -2.6 to -10.4 ([14]; table 4).\nThe presented Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotope geochemistry data represent one more clue to suggest a close relationship between the OMZ and STZ Ediacaran-Early Cambrian Gondwana basins.\nAknowledgements\nThis work was financed and is a contribution for POCI/CTE-GIM/60043/04-Chronotect Project and 1GCP Project 497.\nReferences\n[1]\tTaylor, S.R. &amp; McLennan, S.M.
