They are ubiqui-\n\ntous to each basin and hemisphere. In the Atlantic Ocean, there is an uncanny symmetry\n\nbetween the North and South Atlantic Subtropical Gyres. Focusing on their poleward limits,\n\nwe can think of them as virtually perfect analogues. However, while the North Atlantic Cur-\n\nrent has been extensively studied, the South Atlantic Current (SAC) still has been very little\n\ninvestigated and its knowledge presents crucial gaps on understanding it ocean\u2019s mesoscale\n\nvariability and climate. Very little studies attempted so far to describe the SAC characteristics\n\nin terms of water mass properties and volume transports. In addition, there is the presence\n\nof recently described Saint Helen Current (StHC), which can be considered as the South\n\nAtlantic analogue of the Azores Current. The StHC has its formation tied with the Brazil\n\nCurrent (BC) retroflection. The SAC, on the other hand, is originated at the Brazil-Malvinas\n\nConfluence (BMC), and flows crossing zonally the Atlantic Basin. However, the presence\n\nof the northern branch of Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACCn) (without an analogue in the\n\nnorthern hemisphere) brought a few additional challenges to studying the SAC. The ACCn\n\ncan be thought as the Malvinas Current (MC) Extension, which exits the BMC region via\n\nthe southern flank of the Zap\u00edola Rise. In this work, we revisit the descriptive oceanogra-\n\nphy of the SAC system with newly developed climatologies (WOA13 and ARMOR3D) and\n\nseek to unravel the pattern associated with the current in the Southern limb of the region.\n\nRecent literature mentions that there is an important interplay between this three zonal jets\n\nas the cross the South Atlantic. However, only kinematics arguments were used to pinpoint\n\nthis interplay so far. Hence, we opted to employ a statistical correlation method involving\n\ntemperature, salinity and density vertical profiles (and consequently, T-S curves as well).\n\nWe also computed volume transport values for the whole zonal domain across the South\n\n\n\nxv\n\nAtlantic Subtropical Gyre southern limb. In particular, at the longitude that it reaches the\n\nMid-Atlantic Ridge, the major portion of the SAC veers south and merge almost completely\n\nwith the ACCn. Its smaller northern the StHC. Near the eastern ocean border of the South\n\nAtlantic Ocean, the SAC-ACCn as well as a portion of the StHC traverse into the Indian\n\nOcean. The combined analysis of geostrophic streamfunction fields and the temperature-\n\ndensity correlation diagrams do not show sufficient evidence for the StHC being an inde-\n\npendent current, and not a branch of the SAC. Since there is also no study regarding the\n\ndynamics of the SAC we also constructed a linear QG instability model aiming to evaluate\n\nthe current system mesoscale activity. We then analyzed the mesoscale activity of the SAC,\n\nand discovered that SAC is unstable throughout the whole path domain towards Africa. This\n\ninstabilities, however, are found to be not as vigorous as the ACC. We also identify a shift\n\nin mesoscale vorticity wave regime as the SAC crosses the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. We found\n\nit to be less unstable than at the western side. We, however, could not identify the type of\n\ninstabilities associated with the current. Therefore, we propose as sequential future work to\n\nfurther pursue investigation on the mesoscale dynamics of the ACCn-SAC-StHC system.\n\nKeywords: Subtropical Gyre, Saint Helena Current, South Atlantic Current, Antarctic\n\nCircumpolar Current, Description, Dynamics, Mesoscale, AVISO, WOA, ARMOR3D.\n\n\n\nxvi\n\nResumo\n\nOs Giros Oce\u00e2nicos s\u00e3o os aspectos mais not\u00e1veis dos oceano.

Their vertical extension is about 1000 m, which coincides\n\nwith the the base of the permanent pycnocline.\n\nThe gyre dynamics was unraveled by a series of seminal articles from the late 40\u2019s and\n\nearly 50\u2019s of the XIX Century (Sverdrup, 1947; Stommel, 1948; Munk, 1950). The gyres are\n\nprimarily forced by large-scale winds, or more specifically, by the wind stress curl. The zero\n\ncurl bands, which extends zonally throughout the ocean basins, delimit the gyre meridional\n\nextension. Most of the gyre domain is forced directly by the wind, while the northern and\n\nsouthern borders consist of free geostrophic currents (Sverdrup, 1947). The exception is\n\nthe gyre western boundary, which present narrow, stronger currents explained by continuity\n\nand by the east-west angular velocity of the near-spherical Planet Earth (Stommel, 1948).\n\nThe so-called Sverdrup theory allow us to compute the locked, meridionally-organized\n\ngyre cells merely from meteorological data centers, which excludes the western boundary\n\ncurrents. Of course, no other forcing than winds is considered in this calculation. Figure 1.1\n\nexihibits the pattern observed in the Atlantic Ocean, focusing in the northern hemisphere. It\n\nis clear that the largest cell is the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre.\n\nHowever, the thermohaline component of the ocean circulation introduces a richer and\n\nstratified vertical structure to the ocean gyres and, therefore, allows the gyre cells to ex-\n\nchange mass with the neighboring ones. Therefore, we can restate the affirmation in the\n\n\n\nChapter 1. Introduction 2\n\nFIGURE 1.1: Annual average mass transport streamfunction for the total Sver-\ndrup transport computed from the COADS surface meteorological fields. From\n\nMayer and Weisberg (1993).\n\nfirst paragraph in more complete form: the ocean gyres are primarily mechanically forced by\n\nwinds and modified by the meridional overturning circulation (MOC).\n\nThe observed structure of the subtropical gyres of the Atlantic Ocean is sketched in Fig-\n\nure 1.2. The North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre is formed by North Equatorial Current (NEC)\n\nin the south, the Gulf Stream in the western boundary, the North Atlantic Current (NAC) and\n\nthe Azores Current (AzC) in the north and, the Portugal Current (PtC) and the Canary Cur-\n\nrent (CaC) closing the gyre in the eastern boundary. In the South Atlantic, the anticyclonic\n\nsubtropical gyre is traditionally considered as composed by the South Atlantic Current (SAC)\n\nin the south, the Benguela Current (BeC) in the east, the South Equatorial Current (SEC) in\n\nthe north and, the Brazil Current (BC) bordering the western boundary.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.

From Tomczak and Godfrey\n\n(2013).\n\n\n\nChapter 1. Introduction 4\n\nFocusing on the poleward limit of the subtropical gyres in the Atlantic, we might think\n\nthe NAC and SAC as perfect analogues for the North and South Atlantic Subtropical Gyres\n\n(NASG and SASG), respectively. But, is this assessment correct? The NAC has already\n\nbeen extensively studied in both its characteristics and dynamics (Mann, 1967; Richardson,\n\n1983; Krauss, 1986; Bower and von Appen, 2008). The recent review presented by Talley\n\n(2011) indicates that only a minor part of the NAC veers south to feed the CaC directly.\n\nAbout a third of its transport forms the PtC, which adds (does not add) volume to the CaC\n\nduring the boreal spring-summer (autumn-winter). The other two thirds flows to the Nordic\n\nSeas. It is the AzC which primarily feeds the NEC.\n\nThe dynamics of the NAC is characterized by strong topographic control, which leads to\n\nfinite amplitude meandering and a trifurcation of the NAC jet downstream. Mesoscale sta-\n\ntionary eddies (Figure 1.3) are related to the Newfoundland Rise, Newfoundland Seamounts\n\nand the Flemming Cap (Krauss, 1986; Rossby, 1996). The southnermost eddy is a perma-\n\nnent anticyclonic feature discovered by Mann (1967), known as the Mann Eddy, while the\n\nothers seem to be recurrent and persistent only for months at a time.\n\nOn the other hand, few articles have attempted so far to describe the SAC character-\n\nistics in terms of water mass properties and volume transports. Juliano and Alves (2007)\n\nchallenged the traditional SASG pattern presented in Figure 1.2. These authors suggested\n\nthere is also an analogue to the AzC in the South Atlantic and named it the Saint Helena\n\nCurrent (StHC). For the dynamical investigation of the SAC, the literature was also found to\n\nbe scarce. In the next section, we present a review on the descriptive oceanography of the\n\nSAC and discuss the contradictions among the works.\n\n\n\nChapter 1. Introduction 5\n\nFIGURE 1.3: Schematic path of the NAC and adjacent stationary eddies. The\narrows indicate probable pathways and directions of loss from the NAC to\nthe surrounding waters.

From Rossby (1996).\n\n1.2 The SAC Description\n\nThe original description of the SAC was made by Stramma and Peterson (1990) based\n\non in situ hydrographic data from a collection of historical surveys. They described the cur-\n\nrent as being closely associated with the Subtropical Front (STF), a meridional temperature\n\ndiscontinuity which separates the SASG from the Antarctic Circunpolar Current (ACC) (Fig.\n\n1.4).\n\nAt the formation longitude (45\u00b0 W), they evaluated a maximum velocity of ? 0.1 ms?1\n\nand a transport 14.1 Sv (1 Sv=106m3s?1, Fig. 1.5). The authors justified the weakness of\n\nthe SAC as being caused by the presence of a strong salinity gradient acting in opposition\n\nto the distribution of temperature, and therefore, attenuating the thermal wind as well as rich\n\nmesoscale activity.\n\nThe former authors obtained the largest transport value of the SAC at 30\u00b0 W: 29-37\n\nSv. They also identified at the same longitude a inflection of the STF southward which\n\n\n\nChapter 1. Introduction 6\n\nFIGURE 1.4: Illustration of the oceanic fronts in the Subtropical South Atlantic:\nSTF represents the Subtropical Front; SAF, the Subantarctic Front; PF, the Po-\nlar Front; BCF, the Brazil Current Front. Adapted from Stramma and Peterson\n\n(1990).\n\nwas not followed by the SAC. Stramma and Peterson (1990) argued that shallow southward\n\nextension of subtropical water overrode subantarctic surface water, but most of the baroclinic\n\nstructure of the STF remained north. They also identified what seemed to be a weaker\n\nbranch around 200 km further north of the main current.\n\nAt the eastern side of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAC) (0\u00b0), the current is narrower and the\n\nmost of the transport is found south of STF reaching values of 8 Sv, while the surface front\n\nhas around 9 Sv. Therefore, the total transport was calculated as being 17 Sv. Stramma and\n\nPeterson (1990) then concluded that part of the transport of the SAC turns north to feed the\n\nBeC.\n\nLater, Gordon et al. (1992) studied the eastern side of Atlantic Ocean also through hydro-\n\ngraphic data willing to understand the communication between the waters from this ocean\n\nbasin to the Indian Ocean. They identified the Brazil-Benguela Subtropical Front (BSAF),\n\naround 5\u00b0 W. They stated that the band between this front and the Subantarctic Front (SAF)\n\nmarked the SAC presence.\n\nAccording the aforementioned authors, the SAC transports 12 Sv of thermocline water,\n\nand about 6 Sv of this transport turns to the BeC, whilst the rest continues to flow eastward,\n\npassing into the Indian Ocean. SAC carries the same transport for the lower thermocline,\n\n\n\nChapter 1. Introduction 7\n\nFIGURE 1.5: Vertical Section from R/V Atlantis II at 45\u00b0 W of the zonal\ngeostrophic velocity in cm s?1. The unshaded velocity band correspond to\n\nthe SAC. From Stramma and Peterson (1990).\n\nAntarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW). It is likely, however, that most of the AAIW originated\n\nin the Pacific Ocean with some contribution of the BC. Approximately 4 Sv of this transport\n\nturns to BeC, whilst the rest (8 Sv) flows into the Indian Ocean. The authors also argue that\n\nthe transport patterns of the SAC and its role in the interocean exchange has an impact at\n\nthe global thermocline circulation.\n\nIn contrast, the study by Schmid et al. (2000) identified a transport ranging from 6 Sv\n\nto 26 Sv of AAIW in the SAC (Fig. 1.6). The highest value (26 Sv) was found adjacent to\n\nthe western boundary. They also reported a significantly decrease of 19 Sv between 52\u00b0\n\nW-41\u00b0 W. The SAC transport is reduced at lower rates while the current flows eastward. The\n\nauthors found values ranging from 19 Sv (38\u00b0 W) to 16 Sv (30\u00b0 W) and 6 Sv (1\u00b0 E). This\n\nfaster transport drop, as the authors suggested, may be caused by mesoscale variability\n\nin the region, while the slower drop rates between 38\u00b0 W and 30\u00b0 W could be result of the\n\nexchange of waters between SASG and the ACC. They supported this hypothesis by the fact\n\nthe trajectories of the floaters suggest an interaction between ACC and SAC. This interaction\n\nseems more evident near 20\u00b0 W where both currents seem to merge as one.\n\nThe more recent study conducted by Juliano and Alves (2007) employed the ?-spiral\n\n\n\nChapter 1. Introduction 8\n\nFIGURE 1.6: Illustration of the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) trans-\nport and circulation in Sv. The shaded region represents the 3000m isobath.\n\nAdapted from Schmid et al. (2000)\n\nmethod in its linear and nonlinear versions using a T-S climatology built from hydrographic\n\ndata gathered from three different data distributions centers (NODC, GTSPP and WOCE\u2019s).\n\nWith the absolute geostrophic velocity maps, they claimed to have discovered a new current,\n\nthe StHC. The authors chose the South Atlantic island name in analogy with the AzC in the\n\nNASG (see Figure 1.7).\n\nThe authors interpreted as the StHC is formed due to the northern retroflection of the\n\nBrazil-Malvinas Confluence (BMC) and as flowing eastward paralleling the SAC at 35\u00b0 W,\n\n33 \u00b0 S (Figure 1.8). At about 20\u00b0 W, they also identified the interaction between the southern\n\nedge of the SAC with norther part of the ACC. This meridional, very broad jet in Figure 1.9\n\nmakes the distinction between the ACC and the SAC rather difficult if only velocity patterns\n\nare examined. As a matter of fact, both Stramma and Peterson (1990) and Schmid et al.\n\n(2000) argued that it is actually the displacement of the STF that caused an interaction\n\nbetween these latter two currents.\n\nAt 5\u00b0 W, however,Juliano and Alves (2007) detected a slight northward displacement of\n\nthe SAC core and gets closer to the StHC (Figure 1.8). This current pattern is in agreement\n\nwith Stramma and Peterson (1990)\u2019s findings. From the Greenwhich Meridian to 10\u00b0 E\n\n(Figure 1.10), the intensified StHC moves slightly in southeast direction, and past 10\u00b0 E,\n\nit deflects northwestward merging with the BeC. As previously said, the StHC is the main\n\n\n\nChapter 1.

Richardson (2007) studied the influence of the Agulhas Rings into the\n\nAtlantic Ocean, and he found that the water transported from Indian Ocean by Agulhas Rings\n\ninto the South Atlantic might cause a split in the SAC around 5\u00b0E.\n\nRodrigues et al. (2010) employed the Gravest Empiral Mode (GEM) technique on a\n\nquasi-isobaric subsurface float data set to obtain total (i.e., barotropic+baroclinic) mass\n\ntransports in SASG poleward limb. They estimated a total SAC transport of 50 Sv at 30\u00b0 W.\n\nSome 10.3 Sv of those 50 Sv come from BC, while the rest from MC. In that region Stramma\n\n\n\nChapter 1.

From Juliano and Alves (2007).\n\nand Peterson (1990) calculated a transport between 30-37 Sv. Across the 0\u00b0 meridian, the\n\nSAC also carried the same 50 Sv of transport. Since no change was found between 30\u00b0 W\n\nand 0\u00b0meridian, they concluded, therefore, that there was no evidence for recirculation.\n\nIn agreement with Richardson (2007), Rodrigues et al. (2010) also found the split at\n\naround 7\u00b0 W (Fig. 1.11). They suggested that the reason why earlier studies were not able\n\nto identify this splitting was because of their consideration of baroclinic flow only, which,\n\nfrom their results, was not visible in their baroclinic component, and therefore these studies\n\nregarded an eastward weakening of the current. Neither Richardson (2007) nor Rodrigues\n\net al. (2010) cited or referenced the work of Juliano and Alves (2007), since the three articles\n\nentered the review process in their journals at a very close date.\n\nRodrigues et al. (2010) also found, from their results, that of the 39.7 Sv of the SAC\n\ncoming from the MC only 8.7 Sv contribute to the northern branch of the current. The\n\nsouthern branch either rejoins ACC or flows into the AgCR. Some 4 Sv of these 8.7 Sv\n\ninteract also with the AgCR, while the remaining flow, along with the 10.3 Sv of the BC water\n\nand 8.5 Sv of the AgC to feed the BeC (Fig. 1.11).\n\n\n\nChapter 1.

Adapted from Rodrigues et al. (2010).\n\n1.3 Scientific Questions and Hypotheses\n\nA few ambiguities arise from the literature review presented in the previous section re-\n\ngarding the SAC. One of those is the actual presence of the StHC as an independent current\n\nand not as a branch of the SAC. Another deals with the assertments of most of the reviewed\n\nworks regarding the water masses transported by the zonal jets without presenting the T-S\n\ncharacteristics of the StHC-SAC-ACC system. Therefore, we formulate the following scien-\n\ntific questions to address those unresolved issues:\n\n1. Is the StHC indeed an independent current fed by the first retroflection of the BC as\n\nclaimed by Juliano and Alves (2007) or part of the SAC split into two branches around\n\n7 \u00b0 W, as reported by Rodrigues et al. (2010)?\n\n2. Does the water mass composition allow the differentiation between the SAC and the\n\nACC as well as the indentification of they longitude they merge to exit the Atlantic\n\nOcean basin?\n\n3. What is the role of the StHC in SASG?\n\n4. Is the SAC current unstable throughout its flow path and does the MAC acts a stabilizer\n\nto the SASG southern limb current system?\n\nIn order to attempt to answer these questions, we formulate two hypotheses which will\n\nbe guide the current work. The first hypothesis deals with the descriptive aspects of the\n\n\n\nChapter 1. Introduction 13\n\nStHC-SAC-ACC system, while the latter aims to target the yet unexplored dynamics of the\n\ncurrent system.\n\nHypothesis # 1\n\nThe SAC-StHC with the same T-S signature travel zonally along SASG southern limb and\n\nclose the subtropical gyre.\n\nHypothesis # 2\n\nThe SAC system undergoes through important zonal changes in their jet configurations as\n\nthey cross the South Atlantic basin, which in turn yields different patterns of mesoscale\n\nactivity.\n\n1.4 Objectives\n\n1.4.1 General Objective\n\nThe main objective of the current work is to revisit the description of the StHC-SAC-ACC\n\nsystem with newly available data sets as well investigate the instability processes which give\n\nrise to the mesoscale variability in the SASG southern border.\n\n1.4.2 Specific Objectives\n\n\u2022 To identify the geostrophic current patterns between 30\u00b0 S and 60\u00b0 S using the new T-S\n\nclimatologies available;\n\n\u2022 To spatial variations of the climatology of the StHC, SAC and ACC through their water\n\nmasses structure correlation;\n\n\u2022 To construct a climatological volume transport charts using the new climatologies and\n\ncompare with historical information;\n\n\u2022 To identify the SAC-StHC current intensity and direction variability through daily data;\n\n\u2022 To evaluate the SAC stability through a quasi-geostrophic, meridionally-oriented sectional,\n\nlinear model.\n\n\n\n14\n\nChapter 2\n\nStudy area and Data Sets\n\n2.1 The Study Area\n\nThe study area is comprised between 65\u00b0 S-30\u00b0 S of latitude, and 70\u00b0 W-23\u00b0 E of lon-\n\ngitude (Figure 2.1). Away from the western and eastern continental margins, two main\n\ntopographic emerge from the abyssal plain: the Zapiola Rise and the MAC. The former is\n\na quasi-circular, 250km-radius topographic feature, which height exceeds 1300 m with a\n\nsediment cover of thicker than 3000 mm (Weijer et al., 2015). The Zapiola Rise occupies\n\nthe southwestern corner of the Argentine Basin and plays a crucial role in separating most\n\nof the MC from the BC extension flows (Talley, 2011). The more barotropic flow of the MC\n\nextension is diverted to the south contouring the rise and, as seen in Chapter 1, originates\n\nthe so-called northern branch of the ACC centered at about 50\u00b0 S (Talley, 2011; Tomczak\n\nand Godfrey, 2013). The Zapiola Rise itself is characterized by a permanent barotropic\n\nanticyclonic circulation, which dynamics was unraveled by the Dewar (1998); Miranda et al.\n\n(1999). The MAC within the study area presents a northwest-southeast orientation and rises\n\nmore than 2000 m from the ocean floor.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.

According to Boyer et al.\n\n(2013), the TS data have multiple source of measurements: CTDs, Nansen Bottle data,\n\n\n\nChapter 2. Study area and Data Sets 16\n\nMBTs, XBTs, predecessor of profilling floats, ARGO floats, moored buoy data, and drifting\n\nbuoy data.\n\n2.2.2 AVISO\n\nThe so-called AVISO products produced by CLS Space Oceanography Division are\n\nderived from the SSALTO/Duacs processing integrating data from: HY-2A, Saral/AltiKa,\n\nCryosat-2, OSTM/Jason-2, Jason-1, Topex/Poseidon, Envisat, GFO, ERS-1&amp;2. This data\n\nset extends from 1993 to 2016. It is provided daily maps of absolute dynamic topographic\n\n(ADT) data at a 1/4 \u00b0 grid.\n\nThe ADT maps result on the sum of the daily sea level anomaly (SLA) maps and the\n\nmean dynamic topography (MDT). The last MDT released is the CNES-CLS13 combined\n\ngravimetric satellite data (2 years of GOCE, 7 years of GRACE), and 20 years of altimetry\n\nand in-situ data (hydrologic and drifters data).\n\n2.2.3 ARMOR3D\n\nThe ARMOR3D data utilizes accurate but sparse in-situ T-S data merged with high res-\n\nolution altimeter and SST data to reconstruct global, instantaneous, 3D thermohaline and\n\ngeostrophic velocity fields (Larnicol et al., 2006; Mulet et al., 2012; Guinehut et al., 2012).\n\nAccording to Larnicol et al. (2006), the ARMOR3D geostrophic velocity fields are constructed\n\nthrough 3 steps:\n\n1. The SLA and SST satellite observations are projected onto the vertical via a multiple\n\nlinear regression method and using covariances deduced from historical observations.\n\nThis leads to synthetic fields;\n\n2. The synthetic fields and all available in-situ T/S profiles are combined through an opti-\n\nmal interpolation method. This leads to the ARMOR3D T/S combined fields;\n\n3. The thermal wind equation with a reference level at the surface is used to combine\n\ngeostrophic current fields from satellite altimetry with ARMOR3D T/S fields and thus\n\n\n\nChapter 2. Study area and Data Sets 17\n\nto generate the global 3D geostrophic current and geopotential height fields.\n\nThe TS and geostrophic velocity data sets are provided weekly since 1993. The vertical\n\nresolution consists of 33 levels, while the horizontal resolution is a 1/4\u00b0.\n\n\n\n18\n\nChapter 3\n\nBasic Methodology\n\nThe methods to be presented in this chapter are separated in two sections. In the first\n\nsection, we present the methods and techniques used to describe the StHC-SAC-ACC sys-\n\ntem (or hereafter SAC system) regarding its T-S characteristics, its sectional vertical distri-\n\nbutions and volume transport across the Atlantic Ocean. In the second section, we show the\n\ntools employed to study the current system dynamics, especially in regards to its mesoscale\n\nactivity, and energy fluxes.\n\n3.1 Methods of Hydrographic Data Analysis\n\n3.1.1 Dynamic Method\n\nBase on the classical dynamic method we can infer the geostrophic velocity as:\n\nu(p) = ur ?\n1\n\nf0\n\n? pr\np\n\n??\n\n?y\ndp?, (3.1)\n\nwhere ur is the reference velocity from a known isobaric level, f0 is the Coriolis param-\n\neter, p (pr) is the (reference) pressure level, ? is the specific volume anomaly, and y is the\n\nmeridional distance coordinate. The reference pressure is usually chosen as the level where\n\nthere is a null velocity.\n\nWOA was used to make this estimate from its geopotential anomaly calculated from\n\nthe climatological data offered. A fixed level of no motion was chosen to be approximately\n\n3000 dbar (hence, ur is set 0), which is in agreement with Stramma and Peterson (1990)\u2019s\n\noriginal description of the SAC. The surface geostrophic currents (relative to 3000 dbar)\n\n\n\nChapter 3. Basic Methodology 19\n\nare then compared to surface currents estimated from the AVISO (Archiving, Validation and\n\nInterpretation of Satellite Oceanographic Data) altimetry-derived sea surface height.\n\nThe transport values for SAC system in the region were calculated by the height gradients\n\nand compared with the literature, using the following equation:\n\nT =\n\n??\nR\n\nu dydz,\n\nR = {(y,z) ? R2 : Y0 ? y ? Y1; H0 ? z ? 0}\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere u (ms?1) is the zonal velocity; R is the region being integrated; Y0/Y1 is the south/north\n\nmost limit of the current; H0 is the reference depth chosen for integrating.\n\n3.1.2 Relative geostrophic velocities from ARMOR3D\n\nFor the ARMOR3D, the geostrophic velocity components were also referenced at the\n\n3000 dbar as a way to remove the statistical artifacts produce by its vertical extrapolation.\n\nThis data set, first published in 2012, combines sparse in situ temperature and salinity profile\n\ndata with satellite altimetry and sea surface temperature data to provide a high spatial and\n\ntemporal resolution of 3-D temperature, salinity and absolute geostrophic velocity fields. The\n\nARMOR3D velocity fields are referenced at the surface by the AVISO dataset. We, however,\n\nobserved that probably due to less available TS data to compute the climatology the impo-\n\nsition of the AVISO geostrophic velocities yields to very unrealistic barotropic component in\n\nall zonal jets under investigation in this work. Therefore, in order to avoid this issue and to\n\nallow direct comparison with the WOA geostrophic velocity relative to 3000 dbar, we opt to\n\ncompute the ARMOR3D geostrophic field relative to this isobaric level.\n\n3.1.3 T-S-?0 correlation analysis\n\nFrom the potential temperature (T), salinity (S), and density1 vertical profiles we per-\n\nformed the Pearson Correlation Coefficient at the origin site of SAC (40\u00b0 S, 40 \u00b0 W.)\n1We treat as density in fact the deviation of the potential density referenced at the surface as ?0 from the\n\nreference value of 1000 kg m?3. Mathematically we express it as ?0 = ?T (T,S, 0) ? 1000.\n\n\n\nChapter 3. Basic Methodology 20\n\nr =\n\n?n\ni=1(xi ? x?)(yi ? y?)\n\n[\n?n\n\ni=1(xi ? x?)2]1/2[\n?n\n\ni=1(yi ? y?)2]1/2\n(3.3)\n\nwhere xi, yi are the sample value at specific depth, and x? and y? are the sample mean.\n\n3.1.4 Geostrophic velocities from AVISO\n\nFrom the downloadable Absolute Dynamic Topography (?) fields from the whole time\n\nseries, we computed the average and inferred the geostrophic velocities as being\n\nu = ?\ng\n\nf0\n\n??\n\n?y\n\nv =\ng\n\nf0\n\n??\n\n?x\n.\n\n(3.4)\n\nSince the definition of the streamfunction is: u = ???/?y and v = ??/?x, we can infer it as\n\n? =\ng\n\nf0\n?. (3.5)\n\n3.1.5 Basic Statistics\n\nAs auxiliary analysis methods to perform the intercomparison between the data sets, we\n\nemploy first and second statistical momenta and tests of normality, such as the t-student\n\ntest. Correlation coeficients and normalized roo mean square errors (rms) are used as\n\nfigures of statistical merit to compare two fields of the same oceanographic quantity Pinardi\n\nand Robinson (1987). The normalized rms is given by:\n\nRMS =\n\n?\n&lt;(g1 ?g2)2 >\n\n&lt;g22 >\n(3.6)\n\n3.2 Linear Instability Analysis\n\n3.2.1 Sectional Mixed Instability Model\n\nIn order to evaluate the linear instability properties of the StHC-SAC-ACC system, we fol-\n\nlow Kontoyiannis (1997) and construct a quasi-geostrophic (QG) model of a flat-bottomed,\n\n\n\nChapter 3. Basic Methodology 21\n\nstratified ocean on a ?-plane centered at the latitude of the SAC core (see A for algebraic\n\ndetails). The model solves the Chaney-Stern equation for meridional sections which encom-\n\npass the latitude range of interest (30\u00b0 S-60\u00b0 S) and applied for different longitudes. We\n\nchose the meridians for the model application based upon the results of the jet patterns ob-\n\ntained in the analyses described in the previous section. The longitudes 40\u00b0W, 20\u00b0W, 10\u00b0W,\n\nand 10\u00b0E revelead to be the appropriate choices.\n\nThe QG potential vorticity equation given in terms of the geostrophic pressure is\n\n(?t + U?x)\n\n{\n?2p? + ?z\n\n[(\nf0\nN\n\n)2\np?z\n\n]}\n+ p?xQy = 0 , (3.7)\n\nwhere U is the basic state zonal velocity, p? is the pressure deviation relative to its basic state\n\nP, N is the Br\u00fcnt-V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 (or stratification) frequency, and Qy is the meridional gradient of\n\nthe basic potential vorticity Q defined by\n\nQy = ? ?Uyy + ?z\n\n[(\nf0\nN\n\n)2\nUz\n\n]\n(3.8)\n\nThe Eq. 3.7 is solved considering rigid lids at the surface and bottom, as well as imposing\n\nan idealized zonal channel to restrain the unstable waves to noninfinite wavelengths. Hence,\n\nthe boundary conditions are ???\n??\nw = 0 z = 0, H\n\nv = 0 y = 0, W.\n\n(3.9)\n\nwhere y = 0,W represent the meridional limits of the channel.\n\nWe reach the traditional Charney-Stern instability equation for mixed instabilities by as-\n\nsuming a solution to Equation 3.7 in the form of\n\np?(x,y,z,t) = Re[?n(y,z)e\nik(x?cnt)] , (3.10)\n\nwhere Phi is the nth complex meridional-vertical structure eigenfuction associated with the\n\nnth complex eigenvalue cn, which denotes the complex phase speed of the pressure pertu-\n\nbations.\n\n\n\nChapter 3. Basic Methodology 22\n\nHence, the well-known eigenvalue problem to be solved is\n\n(U ? c)\n\n{\n?yy ?k2? +\n\n[(\nf0\nN\n\n)2\n?z\n\n]\nz\n\n}\n+ Qy? = 0, (3.11)\n\nsubject to the boundary conditions\n\n???\n??\n\n(U ? c)?z = Uz? z = 0, H\n\n? = 0 y = 0, W, .\n\n(3.12)\n\nThe eigenvalue problem 3.11 written in its canonical form is simply\n\n(A? Ic?)?? = 0. (3.13)\n\nThe method chosen for solving Equation 3.13 is finite difference method. The reader\n\nis refered to Appendix B for the detailed discretization of Equation 3.11. The model pro-\n\nvides us the real phase speed, the growth rate, as wells the pressure perturbation spatial\n\nconfiguration of the unstable modes.\n\nWe limit our calculations to a maximum wavenumber value of 0.1 km?1 which corre-\n\nsponds to five times of the inverse of the average radius of deformation of the area, which is\n\nin agreement with the QG theory (Tulloch et al., 2011).\n\n3.2.2 Local Baroclinic Instability Model\n\nSolving the local instability poblem for the whole region provides an interesting view of\n\nthe differences of linear instability properties. This kind of study was conducted by Tulloch\n\net al. (2011), as well as Gill et al. (1974), Johns (1988), Rocha et al. (2014).\n\nThe local instability focus on the potential vorticity reduced by the stretching and ?y\n\nterms. Therefore, only vertical shear instability is solved. The local instability model equa-\n\ntions can be writtern by neglecting the relative vorticity gradient in Equation 3.8, which in\n\nturn becomes:\n\nQ(L)y = ? ?\n?\n\n?z\n\n[(\nf0\nN\n\n)2\nUz\n\n]\n. (3.14)\n\n\n\nChapter 3. Basic Methodology 23\n\nWhile the governing conservation equation is still Equation 3.7, its boundary conditions is\n\nreduced to:\n\nw = 0 z = 0,H. (3.15)\n\nThe solution proposed, therefore, is similar to Equation 3.10, but with the eigenfunction\n\ndepending only on the z axis. The Charney-Stern equation written for the local model, then\n\nbecomes:\n\n(U ? c)\n\n{\n?k2? +\n\n?\n\n?z\n\n[(\nf0\nN\n\n)2\nUz\n\n]}\n+ Q(L)y ? = 0. (3.16)\n\nAs presented in the seccional model, we consider here only the zonal velocity. Other\n\nauthors (such as Smith (2007) and Tulloch et al. (2011)) have included both velocity compo-\n\nnents. We then acknowledge that our results will likely represent an underestimation of the\n\nreal growth rates. We again should state we opted for that in order to allow direct comparison\n\nwith the seccional model.\n\n3.3 Analysis of Energetics\n\nTo analyse the dynamical field of the SAC System we calculated for the AVISO data set\n\n(which is the only data that provides daily outputs) the Mean Kinectic Energy (MKE)\n\nMKE =\n1\n\n2\n&lt;u2 + v2 > . (3.17)\n\nIts eddy fields were also computed as the Mean Eddy Kinectic Energy (MEKE)\n\nMEKE =\n1\n\n2\n(&lt;u?2 > + &lt;v?2 >). (3.18)\n\nFor both of these physical quantities, we also computed the monthly climatological field for\n\neach six sections of interest (40\u00b0 W, 30\u00b0 W, 20\u00b0 W, 10\u00b0 W, 0\u00b0, 10\u00b0 E). MKE and MEKE are\n\nexpressed in this text in terms of energy per unit of mass (m2s?2). The maps of MEKE\n\npresented were low-pass filtered to remove any variability longer than 120 days in order to\n\nassure that we will examine only mesoscale variation.\n\n\n\nChapter 3. Basic Methodology 24\n\nFinally, we present the standard deviation of the Okubo-Weiss field, which is defined as\n\nW = S2n + S\n2\ns ??\n\n2, (3.19)\n\nwhere Sn = ?u/?x??v/?y and Ss = ?v/?x + ?u/?y are the normal and shear components\n\nof strain, and ? = ?v/?x ? ?u/?y is the relative vorticity. Although we miss the leading\n\ndominant term of the equation by taking its standard deviation, we are interested in seeing\n\nthe main field variability of vortices.\n\n\n\n25\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe SAC System Description\n\n4.1 Intercomparison between WOA, ARMOR3D and AVISO data\n\nsets\n\nIn order to analyse and employ the three datasets interchangeably, we opt to intercom-\n\npare the three datasets focusing solely on the surface fields. Of course, the intercomparison\n\nof T-S-?0 fields will consist only of analysis of the WOA and the ARMOR3D sets. The surface\n\nvelocity ones will encompass the three datasets used in this work.\n\n4.1.1 The surface hydrographic fields\n\nThe comparison between the datasets began with WOA and ARMOR3D temperature,\n\nsalinity, and density profile (Figure 4.1). From both datasets, it is visible the presence of a\n\ndense, cold-fresh water tongue coming from the MC and conflicting with the less dense and\n\nwarmer-saltier water from BC (Figure 4.1 A1; A2; B1; B2). Both datasets also show the\n\nfresh water bulb coming from La Plata River at the South America continental margin.\n\nThe largest differences between the datasets, however, arise near the BMC. At the north-\n\nern/southern branch (39 \u00b0 S/ 49\u00b0 S), ARMOR3D/WOA results in a denser water (Figure\n\n4.2.C). Even though ARMOR3D results in warmer water in both branches (Figure 4.2.A),\n\nWOA results in a slightly more saline water at the southern branch (Figure 4.2.B). The den-\n\nsity, however, does not change excessively between data sets. The average deviation of\n\nARMOR3D and WOA are 4.521\u00d710?2\u00b1 0.181 kg m?3 and 4.994\u00d710?2\u00b1 0.1474 kg m?3,\n\nrespectively.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.

The SAC System Description 27\n\nAlthough ARMOR3D estimate an approximately 2\u00b0 C warmer temperature at the South\n\nAmerican shelf (which is the region of the largest temperature difference of the datasets),\n\nmost of the temperature of the region is slightly overstimated by WOA at a maximum of 1\u00b0 C.\n\nAlthough the average temperature difference is not discrepant, each data set exceeds the\n\ntemperature in an average of 0.201 \u00b1 0.211\u00b0 C and 0.209 \u00b1 0.163\u00b0 C for ARMOR3D and\n\nWOA, respectively.\n\nFIGURE 4.2: WOA-ARMOR3D difference fields of temperature (A), salinity (B)\nand density (C).\n\n\n\nChapter 4. The SAC System Description 28\n\nFor the salinity differences, WOA shows at 42\u00b0 S as small bulb extending eastward\n\nthrough the midoceanic ridge. However, the largest discrepancy in this property happens\n\nclose to the La Plata River where there are higher salinity levels in the ARMOR3D by a\n\nmaximum of 10.480 psu and at some parts in the WOA data with a maximum of 4.155\n\npsu. Despite these differences, the average difference of 5.213\u00d710?2\u00b1 0.252 psu and\n\n5.603\u00d710?2\u00b1 0.179 psu for ARMOR3D and WOA, respectively, can be considered small for\n\nthe study region.\n\nThe overall spatial average and standard deviation, which can be seen in Table 4.1, imply\n\nthat both datasets agree and the largest differences found are localized in regions away from\n\nthe study region. This can be futher confirmed by the spatial average and standard deviation\n\nof the fields themselves (Table 4.1 and Figure 4.3.A) which shows that for the temperature,\n\nsalinity, and density the difference are in the range of 0.5%, 0.05%, and 0.05%, respectively.\n\nThe field histograms of the data sets (Figure 4.3.B) also seem to mostly agree between\n\nthemselves.\n\nTABLE 4.1: Spatial average and stantard deviation of the difference between\nthe data sets (Figure 4.2) and the spatial fields of WOA and ARMOR3D.\n\nDifference between data sets ARMOR3D WOA\nTemperature (\u00b0 C) -7.311\u00d710?2\u00b1 0.264 9.272 \u00b1 7.124 9.221 \u00b1 7.202\n\nSalinity (psu) -1.046\u00d710?2\u00b1 0.220 34.504 \u00b1 0.797 34.485 \u00b1 0.813\n\n?0 (kg m?3) 2.513\u00d710?3\u00b1 0.172 26.410 \u00b1 0.750 26.397 \u00b1 0.791\n\nFrom a zonal gradient perspective of density (Figure 4.4.A3 and Figure 4.4.B3), it can be\n\nseen a similar pattern of steep gradients between both data sets. Two steep gradients are\n\nfound at the BMC, which are likely to be the STF and SAF; at the BeC and the La Plata river\n\nthere is algo a significant gradient result, and, finally, a wide zonal band gradient extending\n\nfrom northwest region to the BeC. This feature might likely be associated with StHC. But\n\nagain, a few differences may be denoted between the data sets.\n\nAt the BMC, WOA seems to result a stronger surface density gradient in what seems to\n\nbe the northern and southern branch of the confluence, despite the southern branch being\n\nleaner than ARMOR3D. It is also apparent at the mid oceanic ridge, around 10\u00b0 W, 45\u00b0 S, a\n\nmore pronounced gradient from WOA.\n\n\n\nChapter 4. The SAC System Description 29\n\nFIGURE 4.3: Spatial average and standard deviation (upper panels) and his-\ntogram (lower pannels) of temperature (left panels), salinity (middle panels),\n\nand density (right panels) for WOA and ARMOR3D.\n\nAnalysing the temperature gradient (Figure 4.4.A1 and Figure 4.4.B1), we observer that\n\nthe stronger density gradient at the southern branch of the BMC and at the mid-oceanic\n\nridge are probably justified by the temperature gradient of WOA being much steeper than the\n\nARMOR3D results. However, from the salinity gradient (Figure 4.4.A2 and Figure 4.4.B2),\n\nARMOR3D in general seems to show higher values than WOA, specially at the northern\n\nbranch of BMC extending zonally through the SA ocean.\n\nFrom the literature, the range of isotherms used to define the STF and SAF structures is\n\napproximately 11.5\u00b0 C-18.5\u00b0 C and 4\u00b0 C-8\u00b0 C, respectively. As these fronts present robust\n\nseasonal temperature variations, for instance the winter and the summer values are 11.5\u00b0\n\nC- 15.5\u00b0 C and 14.5\u00b0- 18.5\u00b0 C, respectively Stramma and Peterson (1990); Stramma (1992);\n\nBelkin and Gordon (1996). To produce an annual climatology map for the fronts only by\n\nusing isotherms patterns can be misleading, therefore, we add the temperature gradient\n\nmaps to detect the bands at which those fronts occur on a mean climatological sense.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.

The SAC System Description 31\n\n4.1.2 Surface Geostrophic Velocities and Streamfunction\n\nFrom the geostrophic velocity (Figure 4.5), at the BMC, it can be seen two main jets\n\nflowing eastward at the north and southern branch, which would probably be the SAC and\n\nthe northern branch of the ACC, respectively. At the surface level, between the BMC and\n\nthe mid-oceanic ridge, both jets flow together making it visually indistinguishable. At this\n\ntectonic feature (10\u00b0 W) the currents change trajectory getting stapered and consequently\n\nstronger. Past it, they diverge and flows toward the Indian Ocean.\n\nFrom the SAC flow pattern, at 30\u00b0 W, it is visible a detachment flowing separately from\n\nthe current. This separation is likely resulting in the StHC streaming zonally along with SAC.\n\nHowever, while ARMOR3D and AVISO results in quite similar information, a few discrepan-\n\ncies from the data are present.\n\nWOA, in general, shows a more coherent flow than the other data sets. At the BMC,\n\nthe WOA results in a wider southern branch reaching speeds up to 0.31 m s?1, while at the\n\nnorthern a maximum speed of 0.15 m s?1, which is in agreement of Stramma and Peterson\n\n(1990). However, ARMOR3D and AVISO shows a maximum speed of 0.6 and 0.7 m s?1 for\n\nthe northern branch, and 0.21 and 0.22 m s?1 for the southern branch, respectively. At the\n\nmid oceanic, WOA estimate a maximum speed of 0.25 m s?1, while ARMOR3D and AVISO\n\n0.34 and 0.37 m s?1, respectively.\n\nA similar pattern can be seen in the speed intensity difference between data sets (Figure\n\n4.5.B). The smallest differences are seen in the comparison of ARMOR3D-AVISO (Figure\n\n4.5.B3) reaching a maximum difference of 0.11 m s?1, but an average of 0.01 \u00b1 0.02 m s?1.\n\nWOA-ARMOR3D (Figure 4.5.B1), in contrast, show a maximum 0.49 m s?1, but an average\n\nof 0.02 \u00b1 0.05 m s?1, while WOA-AVISO (Figure 4.5.B2) result in differences up to 0.48 m\n\ns?1 and an average of 0.02 \u00b1 0.06 m s?1.\n\nMost of these differences arise at the MC, where ARMOR3D and AVISO estimate a\n\nhigher velocity than WOA, and AVISO estimates, in general, a higher velocity than AR-\n\nMOR3D. Other significant difference happen at the BeC when comparing the datasets with\n\nWOA.\n\nAnalysing the current function of the three data sets we removed its mean fields and\n\ncalculated the normalized RMS (Table 4.2). AVISO and ARMOR3D are show to be approxi-\n\nmately 30% stronger than the WOA. Although the methodology acquired for each of the sets\n\n\n\nChapter 4.

To identify such currents we\n\nopt to perform an alternative methodology aiming to separate the subtropical current from\n\nthe subantarctic and polar ones.\n\nAt 40\u00b0 W we identify three main eastward flows: two originated at the BMC and a more\n\nsouthern one traversing directly from the Passage of Drake. The TS profile curve at each of\n\nthe three cores are distinct (Figure 4.6) and we can see that each current carries a different\n\nwater mass, and, therefore, present different TS structures. The most evident distinction\n\nbetween the composition of water masses is the presence of SACW (a long quasi-linear\n\ndecrease of TS with depth at around 26.9 kg m?3 ?4) at the SAC origin flow. In contrast, the\n\nother currents do not show a salient temperature variation and are mostly confined at cold\n\ntemperatures. It is suggested that these profiles are within the subtropical, subantarctic and\n\npolar vertical structure, for the north (40\u00b0 S), central (49\u00b0 S), and south (56\u00b0 S) profiles.\n\nSince there is a fair distinction among these sites, there is, therefore, a justification to use\n\nthe correlation method to visualize the actual position of the SAC. Figures 4.7 and 4.8 shows\n\nthe correlation for the temperature, salinity and density parameters. For the temperature, the\n\nband that best correlates with the SAC is within 97%-100%; for the salinity, is the 90%-100%;\n\nand for the density is between 99.5%-100%.\n\nThe parameter that best seems to reflect the SAC seems to be the temperature for both\n\ndatasets. A main zonal band is visible following zonally from the westward portion of the\n\nSASG southern limb basin to its eastward limit. For both datasets is also seen a strong\n\ntemperature correlation within the BMC. East from the mid oceanic ridge the temperature\n\ncorrelation seems stronger at the northern part of the amalgamate current with a expressive\n\n\n\nChapter 4.

This is likely related to the meridional variability of the salinity not being\n\nas expressing as the temperature. Additionally, the correlation SAC correlation significantly\n\ndrecreases zonally east of the MAC.\n\nThe density correlation parameter does not show any substantial patterns for the SAC.\n\nJust as the salinity, the density does not varies greatly meridionally within the region, and,\n\ntherefore, the minimun correlation for the region is 98.5%.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.

The SAC System Description 37\n\n4.2.1 Current Persistence\n\nWe delimited the band of occurrence of the subtropical correlation by the SAC and StHC,\n\nsubantarctic correlation by the nothern branch of the ACC (ACCn), and polar correlation by\n\nthe southern branch of the ACC (ACCs) with the analysis conducted in the previous section.\n\nWe now focus on the two subtropical jets direction and persistence. In order to do so we\n\nemploy the whole AVISO absolute dynamic topography series and plot a windrose map at\n\neach of the six selected longitudes. The latitudes were chosen to uniquivocally capture the\n\nSAC and StHC jets.\n\nAt 40\u00b0 W we can see that the SAC has a 36% probability of going between southeastward\n\nand northeastward (Figure 4.9). However, it does not have a predominant direction, probably\n\ndue to the current still being highly affected by the BMC feature which also makes its speed\n\nover 0.6 ms?1 in most of the eastward directions. In contrast, the StHC is much slower (with\n\na maximum speed between 0.2-0.4 ms?1) and predominantly southeastward with an almost\n\n41% probability (Figure 4.10). This flow is likely not directly associated with the BMC feature,\n\nbut from the first BC retroflection. This has been already argued by Juliano and Alves (2007)\n\nin their original description of the StHC.\n\nAt 30\u00b0 W the SAC is now much weaker (maximum of 0.4-0.5 ms?1) and predominantly\n\nsoutheastward (with 35% probability). It also has an 18% probability of going northeastward.\n\nHowever, the StHC flows predominantly between the southeastward and northeastward with\n\na 42% probability.\n\nClose to the Mid-Oceanic Ridge, at 20\u00b0 W the SAC is slightly stronger (reaching a max-\n\nimum between 0.2-0.4 ms?1) and with a much more dominant direction (56% mainly east-\n\nward). This predominant path followed by SAC might be caused due to proximity of the\n\nmid-atlantic ridge or through the influence of ACC current. On the other hand, the StHC\n\nhas stronger temperature structure correlation (Figure 4.7 and 4.8) and it also is much more\n\nintense (having comparable speeds to the SAC). Its flow pattern also presents a preferred\n\ndirection, with a main eastward flow (with a 47% probability) which might corroborate with\n\nthe presence of the ridge system.\n\nAt 10\u00b0 W the SAC-ACC merge into a single flow. Although most of the SAC flows along\n\nwith ACC, having a southeastward predominance (around 50%) part of the SAC branches\n\noff (around 15%) and turns northeastward and probably merge into the StHC. This latter\n\n\n\nChapter 4.

Isolines represent the streamfunction.\n\ncurrent does not change remarkably east from the Mid Atlantic Ridge. Around 41% the\n\ncurrent has a tendency to flow eastward.\n\nAt 0\u00b0 the SAC still flows along with the ACC. However, the current has now a more notable\n\ndirection variability, but it preserves its northeastward tendency of around 41%. Likewise the\n\nStHC has also more variability, but with a preferred southeastward direction (35% proba-\n\nbility). At this latitude the StHC branches off into two nuclei flowing eastward (Figure 4.5).\n\nHowever, the precise position of the this branching varies slightly from each data set. For this\n\ncurrent, this branching and probably the higher current variability might be in consequence\n\nof the proximity to the AgC influence.\n\nAt 10\u00b0 E the SAC still has a northeast tendency (49% probability) feeding the southern\n\nbranch of the StHC. In contrast, this latter current is now absent of a prevailing flow direction\n\nand much more intense than its previous locations, which corroborates our suggestion that\n\nthere is significant influence of the AgC in the StHC current.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.

Isolines represent the stream-\n\nfunction.\n\nAt 13 \u00b0 E we now check the windrose from each branch of the StHC (Figure 4.11). Both\n\nof them reach a maximum over 0.6 ms?1. Climatologically, the northern branch turns north-\n\nwestward flowing along the BeC, while the southern branch flows southeastward and flows\n\nalong AgC retroflection to the Indian Ocean. Although the latter branch shows preferred\n\nnortheastward direction (33%), the northern branch has a higher variability, but still with\n\n45% of it flowing northeastward.\n\n4.2.2 Velocity Vertical Structure and Volume Transports\n\nIn this section we will analyse climatologically the vertical section of the speed of both\n\nWOA and ARMOR3D data sets. We will associate this analysis with the density correlation\n\nmap computed.\n\nEast of the BMC (at 40\u00b0 W) the SAC is located between 44\u00b0 S - 35\u00b0 S as a double nu-\n\nclei jet (Figure 4.12). The transport of these jets are found to be around 32.1/31.6 Sv and\n\n10.1/11.6 Sv for the southern and northern jet, respectively (as found in WOA/ARMOR3D\n\ndata). Transport estimates at this site differs little of that found by Stramma and Peterson\n\n\n\nChapter 4. The SAC System Description 41\n\nFIGURE 4.12: Vertical section of WOA (left) and ARMOR3D (right) for 40\u00b0 W.\n\n(1990) at 45\u00b0 W (14.1 Sv). We also observe the ACC at between 45\u00b0 S - 65\u00b0 S. For the\n\nWOA data set we can estime the whole transport of the ACC as 118.2 Sv. However, the\n\nARMOR3D data set has the same spatial coverage as the AVISO data set, and, therefore,\n\nthere is no information south of 55\u00b0 S. We can only estimate its transport as probably being\n\nhigher than 70.4 Sv. A small eastward flow is present between 35-30\u00b0 S with a transport of\n\n0.1/0.7 Sv. This flow is probably the precursor of the StHC. It is clear that there is superposi-\n\ntion between the subtropical and subantarctic vertical profile correlation at this region. This\n\nmight be accounted for the mix between BC and MC at the BMC.\n\nAway from the BMC (at 35\u00b0 W) around 1 Sv of the northern flow of the SAC joins the\n\nStHC. In contrast, the southern jet communicates with both its northern flow and the ACC.\n\nAt 30\u00b0 W, the calculated transport for the SAC is of around 59/56.2 Sv, in contrast with\n\nRodrigues et al. (2010) and Stramma and Peterson (1990), all of whom derived a transport of\n\nabout 50 Sv. While for WOA we estimate the transport of the ACC as 90.3 Sv, for ARMOR3D\n\nthe transport is at least 65.95 Sv.\n\nAt 20\u00b0 W (Figure 4.13), the SAC southern jet is merged with the ACC, making the latter\n\nincrease its transport up to 121.5 Sv (> 92.3 Sv for ARMOR3D) and decreasing the SAC\n\n\n\nChapter 4. The SAC System Description 42\n\ntransport down to 19.8/13.0 Sv. Part of the SAC northern flow also merges with the StHC\n\nmaking the latter current increases its volume transport to around 4.8/7.5 Sv.\n\nFIGURE 4.13: Vertical section of WOA (left) and ARMOR3D (right) for 20\u00b0 W.\n\nEast from the mid-ocean ridge, at 10\u00b0 W (Figure 4.14), the ACC and most of the northern\n\njet of the SAC merge and flow in a single intensified flow transporting around 71.7/104.7 Sv.\n\nThe ACCs transport a maximum of 28.0 Sv (>16.5 for ARMOR3D). The StHC presents an\n\neven higher transport at this longitude (around 7.9/11.45 Sv) probably from some interaction\n\nbetween the SAC northern nucleus. There is a narrow and weak remaining SAC flow with a\n\ntransport of about 0.6/0.3 Sv close to the SAC-ACC jet. The ACC now transports both water\n\nfrom subantarctic and subtropical areas (around 45\u00b0 S).\n\nFrom the data, at 7\u00b0 W, we could not detect the presence of a defined SAC split as\n\nindicated by Richardson (2007) and Rodrigues et al. (2010) in any of our data sets. The\n\nlatter authors argue that this split only occurs when analysing the barotropic component of\n\nthe currents, which it was likely eliminated when referencing both WOA and ARMOR3D to\n\nthe 3000 dbar isobaric level. It is important to note, however, that the StHC and a small flow\n\nof the SAC are still present within this region and their location fits with the results portrayed\n\nby these authors.\n\n\n\nChapter 4. The SAC System Description 43\n\nFIGURE 4.14: Vertical section of WOA (left) and ARMOR3D (right) for 10\u00b0 W.\n\nAt the Greenwich Meridian (0\u00b0 GM), the StHC branches off into two jets. The southern\n\njet is slightly deeper and receives an input of the SAC-ACC system and transports a volume\n\nof 10.19/15.86 Sv. The northern branch, in contrast, is slightly weaker and transports ap-\n\nproximately 3.4/3.3 Sv. The presence of the SAC is not aparent at this longitude, since most\n\nof the volume this is either at the StHC or the ACC. However, the literature still considers\n\nthe presence of the SAC and derive a transport of 19 Sv Rodrigues et al. (2010) and 8 Sv\n\n(Stramma and Peterson, 1990). From our results, we argue that the current actually anal-\n\nysed by both authors is the southern jet of the StHC. The combined ACC-SAC flow transport\n\naround 51.7/42.1 Sv. While for ARMOR3D, we do not have information south from 51\u00b0 S, for\n\nWOA we can estimate the whole ACC system transport as 125.1 Sv.\n\nAt 10\u00b0E (Figure 4.15), we do not observe any remaining jet associated with the SAC,\n\nbut rather we observe a robust double-core StHC jet. The southern and northern cores of\n\nthe StHC transport a volume of around 9.6/14 Sv and 8.6/6.5 Sv, respectively. While for\n\nthe ACC-SAC system we have a transport of 69.1/70.3 Sv, the whole ACC system can be\n\nestimated by WOA as being 98.3 Sv. From this longitude to the eastward limit of the Atlantic\n\nOcean, we observe a meandering pattern of about 500 km. This possibly may occur due\n\n\n\nChapter 4. The SAC System Description 44\n\nto formation of Lee Waves due to the crossing of the Mid Atlantic Ridge which might be\n\npossible from the results of Scott et al. (2011).\n\nFIGURE 4.15: Vertical section of WOA (left) and ARMOR3D (right) for 10\u00b0 E.\n\nClose to the eastward limit of the Atlantic Ocean (at 20\u00b0 E), the southern jet of the\n\nStHC merges with the AgC retroflection and flows into the Indian Ocean with a transport\n\nof 19.1/20.4 Sv. At this longitude, the ACC system transports 121.2 Sv (or at least 70.3 Sv\n\nfor ARMOR3D) into Indian Ocean.\n\n4.2.3 Synthesis\n\nWe now summarize our results with the most notable findings. Given the similarity be-\n\ntween the two climatological data sets (ARMOR3D and WOA) we opt to synthesize the\n\nresults using the average between both.\n\nAt the westward edge of the Atlantic Ocean, the SAC is originated from the southern\n\nmost part of the BC retroflection as it collides with the MC. At 40\u00b0 W the SAC presents two\n\nbranches (with total maximum transport of around 42 Sv) and still is highly influenced by the\n\nBMC structure. The SAC branches circumvent the northern border of the Zapiola Rise. On\n\n\n\nChapter 4. The SAC System Description 45\n\nthe other hand, the MC extension contours the Zapiola Rise on its southern border, and as\n\nit is formed essentially by subpolar waters, it is defined as the ACCn. At about 35 \u00b0 S the\n\nStHC is formed from the northernmost portion of BC retroflection feature and presents water\n\nmass characteristics similar to those of southeast Brazil.\n\nFrom 40\u00b0 W to 20\u00b0 W, the SAC feeds both ACCn and StHC, making southern branch of\n\nthe SAC merge completely with the ACC. Making the northern branch of the SAC transport-\n\ning toughly of 15 Sv. As it reaches the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the SAC veers southeastward\n\nand merges almost completely with the ACCn. They then form a broad jet with a transport of\n\naround 80-100 Sv with remarkable changes in water mass properties meridionally. From 10\u00b0\n\nW to 10\u00b0 E, the SAC-ACCn jet presents robust meandering downstream of the ridge in the\n\nclimatological fields, which could be accounted by the fact of passing through the mid-ocean\n\nridge.\n\nIn contrast, the StHC at its formation site transports a mere 0.1 SV and is fed by the\n\nnorthern branch of the SAC across the whole Atlantic Ocean. While it increases notably\n\nits volume transport throughout its path, between 30\u00b0 W-20\u00b0 W the SAC feeding is more\n\nvigorous which causes the StHC to reach the mid-oceanic ridge with 5-7.5 Sv. At 0\u00b0 the\n\nStHC splits into two branches. The southern branch of the StHC follows into the Indian\n\nOcean with a transport of around 10-14 Sv, while still being fed by the SAC, and the 6.5-8.6\n\nSv as StHC northern branch closes the SASG.\n\nBoth WOA and ARMOR3D data sets roughgly agree in terms ofvolume transport results,\n\naside from the most southern region (south of 55\u00b0 S) where ARMOR3D presents no informa-\n\ntion. We summarize this chapter findings by following Rodrigues et al. (2010) (see authors\n\nFigure 11) and building an schematic flow map with the corresponding volume transports\n\n(Figure 4.16).\n\n\n\nChapter 4. The SAC System Description 46\n\nFIGURE 4.16: Schematic representation of the flow pattern and accompany-\ning volume transport values for the upper 3000 dbar in the SASG southern\n\nborder: WOA (upper panel) and AMOR3D (lower panel).\n\n\n\n47\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe SAC System Mesoscale\n\nDynamics\n\nIn this Chapter we analysed the mesoscale dynamics associated with the SAC system\n\nin terms of energetics and quasi-geostrophic instability. The energetics part was computed\n\nfrom AVISO and discussed the partitioning between the mean kinectic energy (MKE) and\n\nmean eddy kinectic energy (MEKE). The instability analysis aims to address the change in\n\nlinear instability properties, such as growth rate and phase speeds of the zonally changing\n\ncurrents at the southern borders of the subtropical gyre.\n\n5.1 Energetics\n\n5.1.1 Anual Climatological Energetics\n\nIn term of energetics the higher kinectic energy are constrained to the SAC and ACC\n\nwithin the BMC (Figure 5.1). Specially the flow that originates the ACC has the highest MKE\n\nand MEKE. This energy can be seen translated in the Okubo-Weiss parameter field variation\n\n(Figure 5.2).\n\nAway from the BMC, there is a significant drop in MEKE and the standard deviation of\n\nOkubo-Weiss; MKE, however, remains slightly stable up to the MAC. The StHC, in contrast,\n\nacquires MKE as it flows eastward, in spite of that, its eddy energy does not significantly\n\nincrease as its OW standard deviation. This increase in kinectic energy occurs due to the\n\nfeeding by the SAC, which corroborates the previous results of volume transport (Chapter\n\n4). This drainage, however, does not seem enough to increase its MEKE.\n\n\n\nChapter 5. The SAC System Mesoscale Dynamics 48\n\nFIGURE 5.1: AVISO mean total (A) and eddy (B) Kinectic Energy. Isolines\nrepresent the streamfunction.\n\nWhen both SAC and ACC pass through the MAC, part of their flow merge into a single\n\nintense stream (as described in the previous chapter), this significantly increases both MKE\n\nand MEKE. However, it seems that the ACCs (5\u00b0 W/55\u00b0 S) gets more unstable than the\n\nSAC/ACC amalgamate, this increase in MEKE is translated into higher eddy shedding as it\n\ncan be seen in OW parameter variation (Figure 5.2). A pool of low MEKE just northward of\n\nthe SAC/ACC amalgamate can also be seen. This might occur due to this current merging\n\nleaving a low unstable region.\n\nAlthough the MKE energy at StHC is not significantly changed as it crosses the MAC,\n\nthere is a slight decrease in the MEKE. This slight decrease does not follow from OW data,\n\nas it seems slightly higher west from the MAC. This suggests that the field variability within\n\n\n\nChapter 5. The SAC System Mesoscale Dynamics 49\n\nFIGURE 5.2: Okubo-Weiss Standard Deviation from sea surface anomaly of\nAVISO. Isolines represent the streamfunction.\n\nthis region was not locally originated, but carried to there somehow. This variability is likely\n\nbeing originated in the AgC and propagated westward until reaching the StHC domain.\n\n5.1.2 Monthly climatological Energetics\n\nIn this section we brothen the analysis carried out in the previous section by examining\n\nthe SAC system energetics monthly variations. Figure 5.3 shows that the highest MEKE is\n\nfound near the BMC and AgC in all months. It also shows the presence of a higher time\n\ndependent variation of energy on these two locations than the other regions. In addition, it is\n\npossible to see again that to the west of the MAC (at the 40?W, 30?W, 20?W) both MKE and\n\nMEKE decrease (Figure 5.4). This contrasts to what is observed to the east of the MAC: the\n\nSAC keeps its nominal energy until it reaches the AgC.\n\nAt the SAC formation site (? 40?W), the MEKE is often higher than the MKE. The highest\n\neddy energy are between June-August (austral winter) with a maximum of 7\u00d710?2 m2s?2.\n\nThe MKE highest values occur during the period of August-January with a maximum of\n\n5.2\u00d710?2 m2s?2. On the other hand, the lowest values of both MEKE and MKE are ob-\n\nserved during the period of February-April. MEKE has a minimum of 4.2\u00d710?2 in April, and\n\nMKE 0.1\u00d710?2 in May.\n\n\n\nChapter 5. The SAC System Mesoscale Dynamics 50\n\nFIGURE 5.3: Mean Kinetic Energy (MKE) and Mean Eddy Kinetic Energy\n(MEKE) monthly climatology. Red line indicates MEKE, while blue line indi-\n\ncates the MKE\n\nAt 30\u00b0 W, we see a notable decrease of both MKE and MEKE, although the MEKE is\n\nstill higher than the MKE. At this site, the highest eddy energy are found at May and at the\n\nperiod from August to December. The maximum energy is of 2.4\u00d710?2 m2s?2 in August.\n\nHowever, the MKE has its maximum energy in February and March (0.7\u00d710?2 m2s?2 in\n\nMarch). However, In April we see a decrease of 0.5\u00d710?2 m2s?2. We speculate that the\n\nincrease in the maximum MEKE in May is associated with this decrease in MKE. From May\n\nto October we see a constant decrease of MKE which seems to also be associated with the\n\nperiod of high MEKE.\n\nAt 20\u00b0 W, we see that both MKE and MEKE reaches their lowest values with very little\n\nvariations of both. While the maximum MEKE is found in November with 0.9\u00d710?2 m2s?2,\n\nthe minimum is found in july with 0.3\u00d710?2 m2s?2. However, the MKE has its maximum in\n\njuly with 0.2\u00d710?2 m2s?2 and minimum in December slightly over 0.01\u00d710?2 m2s?2.\n\nIn contrast, at 10\u00b0 W, the MKE and MEKE starts increasing again likely due to the SAC-\n\nACCn interaction. However, at this site the MKE is slightly over MEKE in the period of\n\n\n\nChapter 5.

The MEKE does not change notably in the period of January-July, but in August it\n\nincreases to 0.8\u00d710?2 m2s?2 and decreases until October. From this month to december, it\n\nincreases its MEKE along with the MKE.\n\nAt the Greenwich Meridian (0\u00b0), the MEKE only surpasses the MKE in October. The\n\nMKE shows a paraboloidal shape between January to July, reaching a maximum in April\n\nof 1.0\u00d7102 m2s?2. At this month, we also see a minimum of MEKE of 0.4\u00d710?2 m2s?2.\n\nHowever, in october we see a peak of MEKE of 0.6\u00d710?2 m2s?2, but also a minimum of\n\nMKE of 0.5\u00d710?2 m2s?2.\n\nNear the AgC (10\u00b0 E), we see a return of the pattern near the BMC. We see again the\n\nMEKE surpassing notably the MKE, but we see less monthly variation of the MKE. The lat-\n\nter shows maximum peaks at March (0.9\u00d710?2 m2s?2) and August-September (1.1\u00d710?2\n\nm2s?2). Near these peaks, we see a sharp decrease in MEKE from january (4.3\u00d7102 m2s?2)\n\nto february (1.9\u00d710?2 m2 ?2) and another decrease from July (5.1\u00d7102 m2s?2) to Septem-\n\nber (1.8\u00d710?2 m2s?2).\n\n\n\nChapter 5. The SAC System Mesoscale Dynamics 52\n\n5.1.3 Synthesis\n\nWe synthesize the results previoiusly presented in which will be used to supplement the\n\ninstability analysis of the next section as follows. The StHC has a remarkable increase in\n\nMKE and MEKE at around 35\u00b0 W. In Section 4.2.2 we observe that in the vicinities of the\n\n25\u00b0 W meridian the StHC increases in transport five times due to more heavily feeding by\n\nthe SAC. Between 35\u00b0 W-10\u00b0 E, its MKE is not notably changed in its path. The current\u2019s\n\nMEKE only slightly increases in the surroudings of the MAC.\n\nThe SAC, in contrast, has a high MKE and MEKE associated with its formationsite. The\n\neddy energy at this region seems to be highly seasonal dependent (higher in winter months).\n\nEastward from its formation, but west from the MAC, we see a decrease of MEKE, specially\n\nwhen the current crosses the MAC system. At that site, the absolute values of MKE and\n\nMEKE as well as its seasonal variability are the lowest. The standard deviation of OW also\n\nshows a local low of eddy presence on the MAC for this current.\n\nEast of the MAC, where the SAC and ACCn merge (? 10\u00b0 W), we see an increase of both\n\nMKE and MEKE of the SAC-ACCn and ACCs. We can see in the OW standard deviation\n\nan increase of eddy variability in the region, suggesting that the energy present is enough\n\nto make the currents highly unstable. Near Meteor Rise (5\u00b0 E) we see another decrease\n\nin MEKE which could suggest the tectonic feature plays an important role on the current\n\nstability and instability since there is a presence of high eddy presence in the region east of\n\nthe rise.\n\n5.2 Linear Instability Analysis\n\nIn this section we address the problem of linear instability of the SAC system by means\n\nof examining the baroclinic instability phenomenon locally and seeking the SAC system jet\n\nmixed instability properties.\n\nFor the first approach, in Section 5.2.1, we follow the guidelines proposed by Smith\n\n(2007) and Tulloch et al. (2011) but employing an adapted version of Johns (1988) 1-D, QG\n\nmodel, as presented in Section 3.2. For the second approach, in Section 5.2.2, we built\n\na version of the Kontoyiannis (1997) model using the meridional velocity vertical sections\n\n\n\nChapter 5. The SAC System Mesoscale Dynamics 53\n\nobtained in Section 4.2.2 for the six selected longitudes (40\u00b0 W, 30\u00b0 W, 20\u00b0 W, 10\u00b0 W, 0\u00b0,\n\n10\u00b0 E).\n\n5.2.1 Local Baroclinic Analysis\n\nFigure 5.5 presents the growth rate and phase speed maps of the unstable waves em-\n\nbedded in the SAC system. As it can be observed in the upper panel of Figure 5.5 it is not\n\nsurprising to us that the BMC and AgC region do not present extremely high values com-\n\npared to the South Atlantic Basin interior. We only considered the zonal component of the\n\nvelocities and both regions are marked by dominant meridional flow patterns (see Figure\n\n4.5).\n\nCorroborating Smith (2007) and Tulloch et al. (2011), the SASG southern border region\n\nis in overall unstable. Exceptions of stable flow are found (i) over the MAC and Meteor Rise,\n\nand (ii) a sort of near-quiescent flow between 8\u00b0 W and 8\u00b0 E at 42\u00b0 S, east of the location\n\nthat the SAC veered south to merge with the ACCn.\n\nAt 40\u00b0 W, it can be can be seen a high growth rate values at 37\u00b0 S and south of 40\u00b0 S.\n\nThe former latitude maximum growth is centered at the core of the SAC northern branch,\n\nwhile the latter maxima seems to be related to both SAC and ACCn since it is located in ther\n\nnorthern edge of the Zapiola Rise (see also Figure 4.7).\n\nEast from the MAC, it is notable the presence of a high growth rate spot at the region\n\nwhere SAC-ACCn merges. This is in accordance with MEKE results, which shows these\n\nregions to present high levels of eddy energy.\n\nIt is interesting to note that around 25\u00b0 W, there is a high growth rate of the StHC which\n\nis the region where the SAC donates volume and momentum to the StHC. This result seems\n\nto correlate with the MEKE map (Figure 5.1). This suggests the StHC is potentially unstable\n\nfrom its formation site to the eastward edge of the basin. The current instability from 10\u00b0 W\n\nto 10\u00b0 E seems to condractict our previous speculation that the tongue of local maximum\n\nvalues of MEKE (depicted in Figure 5.1) between 10\u00b0 W to 10\u00b0 E connects the AgC domain\n\nwith the StHC. We do not, however, disregard the possibility of the interplay between both\n\non the local dynamics of the region.\n\nIn terms of phase speeds, most of the unstable waves within the southern SAASG region\n\npropagates eastward. The fastest propagating waves are generated in the southern branch\n\n\n\nChapter 5. The SAC System Mesoscale Dynamics 54\n\nFIGURE 5.5: (upper panel) Growth rate and (lower pannel) phase speed of the\nlocal most unstable vorticity wave obtained via baroclinic instability analysis.\n\nStreamlines of the main flow are plotted over the linear model results.\n\nof the BMC. The most unstable mode at the formation site of the SAC shows a propagat-\n\ning wave of around 1.5\u00d710?1 ms?1. This speed decreases at the MAC and increases to\n\n2.8\u00d710?1 ms?1 as both SAC-ACCn merge. This speed slightly decrease until it reaches\n\nthe Indian Ocean. In contrast, the StHC\u2019s waves highest phase speed are found around\n\n35\u00b0 W of about 0.7\u00d710?1 ms?1 and maintains this celerity across the South Atlantic Ocean.\n\nHowever, the exception is at the MAC where the model could not model unstable waves of\n\nthe StHC.\n\n5.2.2 Seccional Mixed Instability Analysis\n\nIn this section, we discuss the mixed instability model analysis following Kontoyiannis\n\n(1997). In the very first part of this section, since the QG model was fully constructed in\n\nhouse, we validate the results with analytical jet sections.\n\n\n\nChapter 5. The SAC System Mesoscale Dynamics 55\n\nModel Validation\n\nIn order to validate the validate the model we opt to test barotropic and baroclinic insta-\n\nbility separately. We then formulate a sectional distribution of (i) a jet in an stratified ocean\n\nwhich is stable baroclinically and unstable barotropically; and (ii) a jet which does not satisfy\n\nthe Rayleigh-Kuo instability criterion, but its unstable baroclinically. The general formulation\n\nfor the zonal jet and the Br\u00fcnt-V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency seccional distributions are given by:\n\n???\n??\nu(y,z) = U0(y) F(z)\n\nN2(z) = N20 G(z),\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere F(z), and G(z) are the vertical structure functions for N2 and u, respectively. U0(y) is\n\nthe horizontal structure function for the jet. The theoretical expressions for F(z), G(z), and\n\nU0(y) are given by:\n\n???????\n??????\nU0(y) = u0 sech(y/L0)\n\n2 cos(?2?y/Lu)\n\nF(z) = 1/(u1 + u2) (u1e\n?z/hu + u2e\n\n?z/hN )\n\nG(z) = e?z/hN\n\n(5.2)\n\nThe corresponding values for the barotropically and baroclinically unstable tests, respec-\n\ntively, are presented in Table 5.1.\n\nFor the barotropically unstable jet (Figure 5.6.A1), we created an intense (with a core\n\nvelocity of 0.16 ms?1) and gaussian shaped structure horizontally, which decreases expo-\n\nnentially with depth and reaches the null velocity at 2600 m depth. Th estratification was\n\nset to have a Br\u00fcnt-V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 seccional distribution constant along the y-axis, and that also\n\ndecreases as a simple exponential function with depth. We see that the ambient potential\n\nvorticity meridional gradient (Figure 5.6.B1) just changes of sign horizontally.\n\nNumerically, the profile resolution was of 20 km and 137 m horizontally and vertically,\n\nrespectively. The results of the seccional model was confronted with a simple 1D barotropic\n\nmodel which was run with the same horizontal resolution of the seccional one, i.e. 20 km.\n\nWe see that the ambient potential vorticity meridional gradient (Figure 5.6.B1) just basically\n\nchanges of sign horizontally. There are indeed very small sign inversions probably due to\n\n\n\nChapter 5.

Neverthe-\n\nless, the 1D local baroclinic model solved with the same vertical resolution of the seccional\n\none revealed that the jet is stable.\n\nThe comparison between both models for the batrotropic case, shown in Figure 5.7.A1\n\nand 5.7.B1, shows a virtually total agreement between the datasets. The only notable dif-\n\nference is where between the wavenumber 1.3\u00d710?2 km?1 and 1.4\u00d710?2 km?1. These\n\ndifference might be related to the fact that the model might be only an approximate affine\n\nfunction1.\n\nThe results for the calibration test for the baroclinc case, shown in Figure 5.7.B1 and\n\nFigure 5.7.B2, also exhibits a striking similarity between them. However, there are a few\n\ndifferences worth noticing. At around 5\u00d710?3 km?1, the growth rate curve of the 2D model,\n\nwas somewhat lower than that of the 1D model. The model fails to reproduce the 1D re-\n\nsults for wavenumbers lower than 12\u00d710?3 km?1. This suggests that perhaps there are\n\nlimitations on the 2D model on estimating the instability properties in the long wave limit.\n\nModel Application to Selected Longitudes\n\nWe describe next the application of the 2-D model onto the velocity sections obtained\n\nfor the WOA-derived jet configurations. We use the six selected meridional sections: 40\u00b0 W,\n\n30\u00b0 W, 20\u00b0 W, 10\u00b0 W, 0\u00b0, 10\u00b0 E. After validation, the analysis of the sections from WOA can\n1An affine function differs from a linear function in the sense that: f(x + y) 6= f(x) + f(y).

The analysis will be limited to a maximum wavenumber of 0.1 km?1 as\n\nexplained in section 3.2.1.\n\n1. 40\u00b0 W\n\nThe first section, near the BMC (40\u00b0 W), between 45\u00b0 W-34\u00b0 W, comprises of a cur-\n\nrent of two cores (with maximum velocity of 8\u00d710?2 ms?1 and 7.5\u00d710?2 ms?1), as\n\ndescribed in the Chapter 4, reaching a maximum depth of 3600 m (Figure 5.8). The\n\nnorthern core has a steeper vertical velocity decay as the southern core, which in itself\n\nmight suggest that the former core is more unstable than the latter.\n\nThe instability model results indicate a growth rate curves with three distinctive max-\n\nima. The highest growth rate is at the wavenumber 5.8\u00d710?2 km?1 of about 2.6\u00d710?2\n\n\n\nChapter 5. The SAC System Mesoscale Dynamics 58\n\nFIGURE 5.7: Instability results of the uni/bidimensional model for the phase\nspeed (A) and growth rate (B) for the barotropic (1) and baroclinic (2) instability\n\nresults.\n\ndays?1 slightly higher than the local baroclinically instability result. The phase propa-\n\ngation speed of the fastest growing mode is estimated by the model as 4.4\u00d710?2 ms?1\n\n(Figure 5.9). Using the relation between wavenumber, wavefrequency and the wave\n\nphase speed, we can easily estimate the period of the waves (Figure 5.10). The wave\n\nperiod of the fastest growth rate is of around 28 days.\n\nWe identify, by reconstructing the perturbed meridional velocity vertical profile for the\n\nmost unstable mode (V ?max = Re{?maxei?max}), that the unstable meander core is\n\nassociated with the northern branch of the SAC (Figure 5.9). The velocity perturbation\n\nstructure is confined to 2000 m with a core located at 150 m. The relevant width is\n\nabout 75 km only. In other words, the most unstable meander occurs essentially at the\n\ncore of the SAC northern branch. However, as the range of unstable ks is long, other\n\nmeander patterns and core locations with less degree of instability are possible.\n\n2. 30\u00b0 W\n\nAt this longitude, the SAC still exhibits two cores. Its northern core (between 42\u00b0 S-37\u00b0\n\nS) is more intense than the southern one with maximum velocities of about 9\u00d710?2\n\n\n\nChapter 5. The SAC System Mesoscale Dynamics 59\n\nms?1. The southern core has a maximum velocity of around 7.5\u00d710?1 ms?1. These\n\ncores now have a less pronounced decay as the ones at 40\u00b0 W.\n\nThe most unstable wave at this longitude grows with an approximate rate of 2.6\u00d710?2\n\ndays?1, similar to the rate obtained 40\u00b0 W in terms of not only the rate itself, but also\n\nthe most unstable wavenumber at 0.07 km?1. The unstable wave phase speeds are\n\neastward for the whole computed k range. The model estimates the phase speed for\n\nthe fastest growing mode as 8.2\u00d710?2 ms?1.\n\nWe see that for the fastest growth rate, the velocity vertical structure is again centered\n\nat the northernmost core with a period of about 12 days. The core of this perturbation\n\nmode is located at 200 m depth while its structure is confined in depth by 1500 m and\n\nwidth by 121 km. Hence, we observe that despite the basic jet between 40\u00b0 W and 30\u00b0\n\nW retains similar characteristics, the waves at the latter longitude seems to propagate\n\nfaster than those at the former.\n\n3. 20\u00b0 W\n\nNear the west edge of the MAC, the southermost SAC core is almost negligible with a\n\nvelocity of about 5.5\u00d710?2 ms?1, while the northernmost core has a velocity of around\n\n7.3\u00d710?2 ms?1. Therefore, the SAC presents a more conventional parabolic jet profile.\n\nThe mean jet structure decays faster with depth than the previously analysed section.\n\nThe growth curve pattern resembles those of calculated for 40\u00b0 W and 30\u00b0 W with\n\nsingle maximum well defined at the wavenumber of 0.05 km?1. The corresponding\n\ngrowth rate is 2.4\u00d710?2 days?1. The phase speed regime for the k range of interest\n\nshows eastward propagating waves increasing in speed with decreasing wavelength.\n\nThe phase speed of the fastest growing phase meander is 5\u00d710?2 ms?1. The most\n\nunstable wave has a characteristic period of 28 days.\n\nThe maximum amplitude of the perturbed meridional velocity is foudn again at the core\n\nof the northern branch with a maximum at 150 m depth and with a vertical structure\n\nconfined in the upper 2300 m. The more relevant amplitudes are limited to about 43\n\nkm around the v? core.\n\n4. 10\u00b0 W\n\n\n\nChapter 5.

The SAC System Mesoscale Dynamics 61\n\nFIGURE 5.9: Model instability results (phase speed and growth rate). The\nshadowed region represents the domain not analysed\n\nNear the east edge of the MAC, the mean jet configuration of the SAC (located at 40\u00b0\n\nS and 38\u00b0 S) have a vertical velocity of 1\u00d710?2 ms?1 with a very weak vertical decay.\n\nBetween 38\u00b0 S-32\u00b0 S, the StHC current presents a core 6\u00d710?2 ms?1 with a strong\n\nbaroclinic vertical decay and, therefore, a vertical structure confined at the upper 1500\n\nm.\n\nThe instability property curves are remarkably different from the more western sections\n\nstudied previously. The fastest growth rate is 0.5\u00d710?2 days?1 for the 0.03 km?1\n\nwavenumber. The speed of the propagating wave of the fastest growth rate is westward\n\nof around 3\u00d710?2 ms?1 and a wave period of 21.5 days.\n\nThe perturbed velocity pattern exhibits lobes and counterlobes with opposing signs\n\nand are, as in all other cases, centered at the StHC current core. The maximum\n\nabsolute v? value is found at 400 m. The depth and width of the meander patter is\n\nfound to be 600 m and 67 km, respectively.\n\n\n\nChapter 5. The SAC System Mesoscale Dynamics 62\n\n5. 0\u00b0 W\n\nAt this longitude, the StHC core has properties resulting from the merging between the\n\noriginal StHC and portion of the SAC northern branch (which mainly occurred at 20\u00b0\n\nW). Its maximum velocity is about 6\u00d710?2 ms?1. The StHC vertical structure reaches\n\nthe ocean floor. The jet presents a clssical parabolic shape with about 666 km.\n\nThe modeled growth rate curve increases almost monotonically as a function of the\n\nwavenumber. Therefore, its fastest growth rate within the wavenumber range of interest\n\nwas found at 0.1 km?1 (which is the upper bound k chosen for our analysis). The phase\n\nspeed curve is virtually a straight line with westward constant values of 0.4\u00d710?2\n\nms?1. The period of the corresponding fastest growing wave is 165 days.\n\nThe instability velocity was found at the southernmost part of the section at the bottom\n\nof the column. This very narrow structure (17 km), has its core located at 2600 m\n\ndepth with 1000 m height. As this velocity pattern presents abnormal structure, we\n\nchoose to disregard this result in comparison with the previous ones.\n\n6. 10\u00b0 E\n\nCloser to the AgC retroflection system, the StHC is split into two cores where, as\n\ndiscussed in section 4.2.3 (Figure. 4.16), its southern branch flows southward, joins\n\nthe SAC-ACCn jet, and flows towards the Indian Ocean. The northern branch is the\n\none to close the SASG.\n\nThe growth rate curve of this section resembles a gaussian shape and, therefore, only\n\none maxima (1.5\u00d710?2 days?1) which corresponds to the wavenumber 0.04 km?1.\n\nThe most unstable wave travels eastward with c = 1.9\u00d710?2 ms?1. This unstable\n\nwaves has periods of 89 days.\n\nThe perturbed velocity profile presents its maximum amplitude at 200 m and extends\n\ndown to 3100 m. It presents a width of 262 km and unlike the previous results its\n\nmaximum is located in the region in between the two branches.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.

The shadowed region represents the domain not analysed\n\n5.2.3 Discussion and Synthesis\n\nIn this section we summarize the mesoscale dynamics of the SAC as having a significant\n\nchange throughout its path. The MAC seems to act not only to change the kinematic of the\n\ncurrent system (see Chapter 4), but also its instability. The linear instability properties are\n\nsummarized in Tables 5.2 and 5.3.\n\nFrom the seccional model analysis we observe two clear distinctive regimes: one at west\n\nand another at east of the MAC. West of the MAC the growth rates and phase speeds are,\n\non average, 2.5\u00d710?2 days?1 and 5.9\u00d710?2 ms?1, respectively. Just east of the MAC (10\u00b0\n\nW), growth rates are very slow and velocities are weakly westward in the seccional model\n\nand weakly eastward in the local baroclinic model. Our interpretation is that in this sense\n\nthe topographic feature seemed to somehow stabilize the SAC-StHC jet. With the merging\n\n\n\nChapter 5.

Although, at 10\u00b0 E, the instability analysis of the seccional model\n\nshows an instability between both northern southern cores of the StHC, the local instability\n\nmodel presents a high instability at both northern and southern cores of the jets. This result\n\ncould indicate a presence of a significant barotropic instability within this section.\n\nWe are not aware of any specific studies regarding the mesoscale dynamics and insta-\n\nbility in the southern border of the SASG to date. The only ones seem to be the global study\n\nfocused on local baroclinic instability by Smith (2007) commanded in the previous subsec-\n\ntion. Although they are much faster than the local baroclinic model, which averages around\n\nof 1.6\u00d710?2 days?1, the patterns between both models are roughly similar, i.e. the growth\n\nrates west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge are slightly faster than those at east of it. However,\n\n\n\nChapter 5.

(2011) in our region for\n\nthe Ocean Comprehensible Atlas (OCCA) data set (which is approximately 0.05 days?1).\n\nAlthough Kontoyiannis (1997) also finds substantially faster growth rates for the Gulf Stream\n\n(around 0.15 days?1), the wavenumber of the fastest growth rate for this current is around\n\n0.025 km?1 which is roughly similar to our region (Figure 5.9). Smith (2007) calculated a\n\ngrowth rate of 0.16 days?1 for the ACC south of Tasmania and 0.036 days?1 for the Kuroshio\n\nextension which is the most similar instability results as our region.\n\nThe unstable wave phase speeds of our seccional model are partly in agreement with our\n\nlocal baroclinic model results having simulated eastward-propagating waves, but at faster\n\nspeeds. Aside from the spurious results of the 0\u00b0longitude, the 10\u00b0 W is the only longitude\n\nthat produces opposite wave speed propagation for both models. Hughes (1995) through\n\naltimetry results found that Rossby waves propagating eastward are common in the southern\n\noceans which is in agreement with our findings for the SAC current. They also found that\n\nwithin the ACC core Rossby waves propagates eastward, however, away from the core,\n\nRossby waves propagates westward, which was not identified by our local baroclinic model.\n\nHughes (1996) argues that propagation of baroclinic Rossby waves are strongly affected\n\nby the mean flow in high latitudes. The author argues that large-scale eastward flows with\n\nspeeds greater than those of long Rossby waves advect all of these waves eastward.\n\n\n\nChapter 5. The SAC System Mesoscale Dynamics 66\n\nThe perturbation velocity does not greatly changes across sections, except the 10\u00b0 W\n\nwhich is a very narrow and shallow jet with the deepest core. Smith (2007) found that the\n\nACC south of Tasmania presents a v? core of about 1000m depth. On the other hand, the\n\nauthor reported the Kuroshio extension presented 200m v? maximum velocity, which is in\n\nagreement with our model. A first inspection on the Qy, U, and v? fields of the selected six\n\nlongitudinal transects suggests that the SAC system are dominated by baroclinic Phillips-like\n\ninstabilities. Indeed, from the results of Tulloch et al. (2011) Charney-type are more common\n\nwithin low latitudes, which does not seem to be the case for our region.\n\n\n\n67\n\nChapter 6\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this chapter we conclude our findings and present our interpretation to our hypotheses\n\nestipulated in Section 1.3. To confirm or reject our first hypothesis, we answer the questions\n\nraised in the same section which themselves led to the hypothesis formulated:\n\n1. Is the StHC indeed an independent current fed by the first retroflection of the BC as\n\nclaimed by Juliano and Alves (2007) or part of the SAC?\n\nOur results show that there is slight difference between the temperature correlation\n\nof the SAC and StHC. Additionally, it was identified a trivial transport of the StHC at\n\n40\u00b0 W which only significantly increase east of 30\u00b0 W. So, the formation of this current\n\nmight not be located at the BMC, but rather at the SAC itself. Therefore, our results\n\ndo not significantly support the idea of the StHC being an independent current. It is\n\nlikely that the StHC is a nothern branch of the SAC (SACn) that travels zonally along\n\nits other branch (SACs).\n\n2. Does the water mass composition allows the differentiation between the SAC and the\n\nACC as well as the identification of their longitudes as they merge and exit the Atlantic\n\nOcean basin?\n\nWe interpret that the T-S-?0 correlation analysis provided a clear result differentiating\n\nboth SAC and ACC. The SAC is easily visible within subtropical correlation structure\n\nas it flows zonally until the MAC. At this site, however, the velocity analysis structure\n\nindicates that the SAC is not distinguishable from the ACCn. Their water mass proper-\n\nties are transported to Indian Ocean as a broad jet (with a meridional span of 5\u00b0). The\n\nACCn and ACCs jets are easily distinguishable through most of the ocean basin. We\n\n\n\nChapter 6. Conclusions 68\n\ncan therefore say that through the water mass composition we can estimate the region\n\nwhere the waters are most closely correlated with the current, but as they merge we\n\ncannot identify them separately.\n\n3. What is the role of the StHC (SACn) in the SASG southern limb?\n\nThe SACn is the branch which indeed closes the SASG. As it approach the eastern\n\nSouth Atlantic boundary, it also splits in two branches. The southern branches follows\n\nzonally to the Indian Ocean, while the northern veers northeastward along with BeC\n\nclosing the gyre. The SACs, however, is fully merged with the ACCn (10\u00b0 W) and flows\n\nalong to the Indian Ocean. Part of this current feeds StHC from its formation to about\n\n10\u00b0 E.\n\nFrom the answers provided above, we do not reject our first hypothesis that The SAC-\n\nStHC (SACn-SACs) with the same T-S signature travels zonally along the SASG southern\n\nlimb and close the gyre. The T-S-?0 correlation provides a slight distinction between the\n\nSACs-SACn (which should be further investigated), but provides a clear distinction between\n\nthese currents and the ACC. Additionally the transport analysis suggest that the location of\n\nthe SACn is at the SAC current.\n\nThe second hypothesis formulated is related to the instability analysis. To further confirm\n\nor reject our hypothesis, we again turn to answer our question from section 1.3:\n\n1. Is the SAC current unstable throughout its flow path and does the MAC acts a stabilizer\n\nto the SASG southern limb current system?\n\nYes, we find that, in general, the whole SAC system is unstable throughout the SASG.\n\nFrom our local baroclinic and seccional mixed model, suplemmented our energetic\n\nanalysis, we identify a clear change of instability characteristics and eddy energy. Al-\n\nthough, the current at the eastern side of the MAC (10\u00b0 S) seems more stable than in\n\nthe western side, the eddy energy seems to not be affected, suggesting a more com-\n\nplex phenomena involving the unstable zonal jets and AgC rings region. We should\n\nmention that in the vicinities and over the Meteor Rise the current are stable by the\n\nlocal model simulations and marginally unstable by the mixed seccional model.\n\nWe therefore do not reject our second hypothesis of The SAC system undergoes through\n\nimportant zonal changes in their jet configurations as they cross the South Atlantic basin,\n\n\n\nChapter 6. Conclusions 69\n\nwhich in turn yields different patterns of mesoscale activity. The SAC does undergoes\n\nthrough changes as it crosses the Atlantic Ocean. The most relevant differences are found\n\nwhen the current crosses the MAC, and also through the Meteor Rise. We suspect the\n\nformation of lee waves at the site, but we did not investigated it further.\n\nIn order to advance in the understanding of the heat and salt fluxes at southern limb of\n\nthe SASG, more in situ observations are needed. In particular, direct velocity profiling on the\n\nSAC system must be carried out. We found only one hydrographic transect from the WOCE\n\nprogram which crossed the BMC that had LADCP profiles available.\n\nAs future work, we aim to conduct further investigation using global model outputs and\n\nsatellite altimetry in order to better understand the instability wave and the related eddy\n\nfluxes associated with them. We know that the South Atlantic ocean is probably the last\n\nfrontier of the worlds ocean to be unraveled in its role to the world climate.\n\n\n\n70\n\nAppendix A\n\nThe Partial Differential Instability\n\nEquation\n\nFrom the linearized quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity equations:\n\n???\n??\nDt(vx ?uy) + ?v = f0wz\n\nDt? + w??z = 0\n\n(A.1)\n\nwhere Dt is the total derivative;? is defined as ? = fy; w is the k? component of velocity;\n\nand ? and ?? is the density and its horizontal average.
