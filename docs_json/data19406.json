INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nIn a World, currently defined by globalization and internationalization, a company that \n\ndoesn\u2019t have these definitions on their vision we can say it suffers from strategic myopia. \n\nFortunately, that is not the case of the companies analyzed. Visabeira, one of the biggest civil \n\nconstruction companies in Portugal, \u00c1guas de Portugal, the leader in water treatment in \n\nPortugal, and Efacec, a Portuguese company in the energy sector and World leader in \n\ninfrastructure in fast recharging for electrical cars, where three Portuguese companies that saw \n\nthe opportunities that India was offering and took advantage of it. \n\nIndia is an odd choice for Portuguese companies to have in their strategic vision when \n\nstruggling with the need/opportunity of internationalization. The differences in the \n\ndevelopment of the two countries, the levels of literacy, the language, the way of doing \n\nbusiness and especially the cultural differences, make a tough call for Portuguese companies \n\nto select this country as an internationalization option. But the Indian government is well \n\naware of problems like poverty, pollution and living conditions, and is making massive \n\ninvestments on these fields and his trying to attract foreign investment to create \n\ninfrastructures to solve this situation, which is getting the attention of several companies. \n\nGoing in further detail, not only getting the attention of companies, India has focused the \n\nattention of countries, and in January 2017, the Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa and \n\nother Ministers visited India in a state mission. This trip has opened the door to several \n\nPortuguese companies to start doing business in India, being one of those cases \u00c1guas de \n\nPortugal. \n\nQuoting HE the India Ambassador in Portugal, Mrs. K. Nandini Singla, \u201cthe bilateral trade \n\nbetween the two countries has grown 17% in last fiscal year, reaching more than 800 million \n\neuros. By itself this is a very good figure, but we can do even better\u201d. \n\nWith these aspects in mind, the present dissertation will highlight three areas on exploration \n\nin the Indian market, which are the luxury segment, social problems segment, and outsourcing \n\nsegment and then explain how the Portuguese companies analyzed are exploring this \n\ninternationalization options. \n\n \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\n1.1. RESEARCH QUESTIONS \n\n \n\nWhat are the factors that attract Portuguese companies to go to India?  \n\nDo Portuguese companies have the capacity to satisfy the needs of a country like India? \n\nWhat are the similarities between the paths followed by each the Portuguese companies when \n\ninternationalizing to India? \n\n \n\n1.2. ACADEMIC RELEVANCE \n\n \n\nFor a better understanding of the academic relevance of this investigation, the author would \n\nlike to stress the fact that this is the first study in the field of internationalization strategies of \n\nPortuguese companies to India. There fewer studies of internationalization to developing \n\ncountries and even rarer to BRIC countries and precisely to India, this dissertation is pioneer. \n\nTherefore, this investigation has the purpose of being a vital tool for the companies analysed \n\nas an outdoor vision of their strategic planning and also to create awareness of the potentiality \n\nof the Indian market to other Portuguese companies, with the desire of changing/restructuring \n\ntheir internationalization strategy. \n\nTo conclude, the author hopes that this dissertation might open the possibility of further \n\nstudies, not only about the India market but also investigations of other countries that are also \n\neconomically attractive but are simply neglected because of the lack of knowledge regarding \n\nthat market. \n\n \n\n1.3. METHODOLOGY \n\n \n\nTo have a full and well-developed answer to the research questions proposed, the author will \n\nuse two types of data: primary data and secondary data. \n\nThe primary data is based on personal interviews with managers of each company. The \n\nmeetings had the same structure so that they could be compared, with one part equal to every \n\nfirm and other adapt to each reality. It focused on four questions: Why India; What were the \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nproblems when entering India; what are the daily problems of doing business in India; What \n\nare the perspectives for the future.   \n\nThe secondary data, so that the investigation could have a well-grounded structure, literature \n\nwas revised using Top Journals and Google Scholar. Scientific papers related to \n\nGlobalization, Internationalization strategies and entry modes where deeply investigated.   For \n\nthe contextualization of the Indian market, databases as World Bank and Asian Development \n\nBank were used, documents from organizations as Invest India, PIB HUB and Indian \n\nEmbassy in Portugal where analyzed and official websites from the Indian government where \n\ninterpreted. For the examination of the companies, their sites and annual reports where \n\nscrutinized. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\n2. LITERATURE REVIEW \n\n \n\nThis chapter of the dissertation has the purpose of supporting my case study by framing \n\nrelevant topics in the concept of internationalization companies to India. Four theoretical \n\nconcepts are going to be explored in detail, more precisely: Globalization; Internationalization \n\nStrategies; International Entry Modes; Indian Economy; Emergent economies-Growth of the \n\n\u201cBRIC.\u201d \n\nThus, this section of the emergent economies the author will highlight what makes relevant \n\nthe focus on this economies and what do they to differentiate from other developing countries, \n\nwhich should be a part of significant attention by the reader because it will be the link to the \n\nnext topic, where the author will go deep in the focus on India, the economy that the \n\ncompanies analyzed have chosen to do their international expansion. \n\n \n\n2.1. GLOBALIZATION \n\n \n\nFor a better framework of the topic of this investigation, it is crucial an understanding of the \n\ninterconnections of all economies in the World. Nowadays, \u201ceconomic globalization \n\nconstitutes an integration of national economies into the international economy through trade, \n\ndirect foreign investment (by corporations and multinationals), short-term capital flows, \n\ninternational flows of workers and humanity generally, and flows of technology\u201d (Bhagwati, \n\n2004). \n\nAccording to several authors (Levitt 1984; Yip 1992; Bartlett and Ghoshal), globalization of \n\nmarkets is the most recent and dominant change in the World economy. This phenomenon is \n\nthe combination of several of individual differences, for instance in the domain of technology \n\nwe have: improvements in telecommunications, which enables a faster and adequate \n\ncommunication between the firms; improvements in transportation, for example, the \n\ncontainers, airplanes, and supertankers provide a more competent movement of products and \n\npeople between the different countries; and developments in the production process, making it \n\ncost-effective product adaptation, like for example a flexible production system (Axinn and \n\nMatthyssens, 2002). \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nAlso, the countries have created conditions for this innovation could have more impact on the \n\nWorld economy. Axinn and Matthyssens (2002) argued that has been a significant reduction \n\non trade barriers among countries with the creation of market agreements like NAFTA and \n\nMERCOSUR (built on the experience of the EU) and over continued tariff reductions \n\nnegotiated by the GATT, which now has been replaced by the WTO. \n\nAfter a clear understanding of what globalization is, we should change our focus to the \n\ncompeting perspectives of globalization provided by Ngaire Woods (1998) where he gives \n\nthree different views on globalization, describing then as market-centered, state-centered and \n\npeople-centered. \n\nThe market-centered approach on globalization focuses his target on the expansion of \n\ncapitalism, more precisely on the increasing extent and location of transactions in the World \n\neconomy and on the qualitative changes happening in how firms produce and distribute their \n\nproducts and services. This analysis suggests that technological advances and a more efficient \n\nbehavior from multinational enterprises can provide a more structured allocation of resources \n\naround all globe since capital will move to where is more profitable. Comparably, the price \n\nmechanism will provide a better organization of production across the planet and so a more \n\nefficient distribution of products and services. This perception of globalization is in fact quite \n\npositive because it brings benefits to investors, producers, and consumers (Woods, 2002). \n\nThomas Biersteker (1989) in his investigation about the way major institutional players are \n\nrebuilding their processes of thinking and operating, arguing that globalization is affecting the \n\nquality of the transactions in all over the World, and not only the quantity. Because of this, a \n\nnew possibility of opportunities and challenges emerge to firms, workers, and consumers \n\nfrom all over the planet. \n\nThe second perspective, the state-centered, emphasizes the role where states do in facilitating \n\nand managing globalization, and also the implications that globalization as in the internal \n\nmarket/competition, contrasting with the market-centred approach that predicts continuous \n\nerosion of the importance from the government policies given by the state (Hirst and \n\nThompson, 1996; Wade, 1996). Also, these authors argue that a continuous integration \n\nbetween the World economies and the increasing of the welfare of the states is not a recent \n\nrelationship. \u201cGovernments have used policies to \u201cbuffer\u201d their citizens from the dislocations \n\nand vulnerabilities of World markets.\u201d By doing this, welfare states have allowed global \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nintegration by avoiding a political answer against the global economy.  This two-level process \n\nof globalization and welfarism has been called \u201cembedded liberalism\u201d (Ruggie, 1983). \n\nLast but not least, Wood (2002) presents us the people-centered perspective, stating \n\n\u201cglobalization does not just affect markets and states.\u201d This view focuses on social forces that \n\nare in the society are caused by globalization and the possibilities for change. The new \n\ntransnational influence on media, music, books, general ideas and value are spreading with \n\nthe purpose of creating a global culture. But, although this seems an easy process, it is wrong \n\nto think that for instance, western values like democracy and human rights are easy to spread \n\nin other cultures. According to the author, gives the example that western values might \n\ndisseminate into the Middle East, but this region in the World has built a strong opposition \n\nagainst \u201cthe West,\u201d and they want to continue to be tied to their national and religious \n\nidentity. This way globalization releases forces that restructure global society but not in a way \n\nthat can be controlled or managed by the booming zones of the industrialized countries. \n\nIn summary, globalization is changing not only what firms, states, and people do, but also \n\ntheir identity and preferences are facing some differences. Globalization is restructuring the \n\nsources of power in World politics as well. States, firms, and other players are losing \n\nautonomy in some areas, and improving in others. However, states have not seen the \n\ndistribution of power changed. Instead, globalization has reinforced the traditional hierarchy \n\namong countries, supporting the influence of rules that were pioneer shaping globalization \n\nand strengthened their ability to control the ongoing impact (Woods, 2002). \n\nIn the next topic, I will provide the theoretical frameworks of the strategies that companies \n\nchoose to embrace their international influence. \n\n \n\n2.2. INTERNATIONALIZATION STRATEGIES \n\n \n\nFirst and foremost we need to understand the meaning of \u201cInternationalization Strategy\u201d, as \n\nbeing \"strategy\" the capability of \u201c understanding and industry structure and dynamics, \n\ndetermining the organization\u2019s relative position in that industry, and taking action to either \n\nchange industry\u2019s structure or the organization\u2019s position to improve organizational results\u201d \n\n(Oliver, 2001). In  \"internationalization\" we have two views. According to Calof and Beamish \n\n(1995), they define as \u201cthe process of adapting a firm\u2019s operations (strategy, structure, and \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nresources, etc.) to environments\u201d. But can also be defined internationalization concept by \n\nconnecting the organization theory which explains international joint ventures and the trade \n\ntheory that analyzes the location of the firm\u2019s operation. This approach proposes that \n\ncompanies to benefit from asymmetries in capabilities and knowledge, they need to develop \n\nand expand theirs resource across international markets (Buckley and Casson, 1976). \n\nOne of the assumptions of internationalization is that the firm has a competitive advantage to \n\nprovide the international market with superior products which will be overcome by cost and \n\naccountability of foreignness (Hans\u00e9n, 1981; Hymer, 1979; Zaheer, 1995). Once this issue is \n\naccomplished, Root (1987) says that the reasons for a firm to go international it\u2019s because the \n\ndomestic market is stagnant, and/or the foreign market in increasing faster, with possibilities \n\nof economies of scales, by increasing the production and reducing cost, or the customers or \n\ndomestic rivals are going abroad. All this process allocates an enormous amount of resources \n\nthat need to be taken into account by a firm, especially the time and money is necessary for \n\nthe internationalization (Root, 1987). \n\nFor a better understanding about Internationalization Strategies, the next category will be \n\nabout theories/models of internationalization, which take into account different assumptions \n\nand structures, namely: The Uppsala Model; The network model; The resources-based view; \n\nThe OLI framework. \n\nThe Uppsala model assumes a combination of commitment of resources and a gradual \n\nacquisition of knowledge for international operations (Johanson and Vahlne, 1990). It is the \n\nincrease of knowledge that can make the firm\u2019s impression of market uncertainty decrease, \n\nwhich will influence the allocation of resources for the process of internationalization. Thus, \n\nincremental market knowledge sparks the business to proceed in small but progressive steps \n\nin the international expansion. \n\nAccording to Johanson and Mattsson (1988), the network model is the network activities are a \n\nvaluable source that provides an opportunity for the firm to form relationships, and with that, \n\nit can access to markets and resources. The business networks a company can build can be \n\nwith different stakeholders, for instance, customers, suppliers and even with competitors. \n\nAlso, the authors explain that there is a definite correlation between firm\u2019s \n\ninternationalization efforts and the number and power of the relationship with all the business \n\npartners, which result in an approach to markets and resources. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nGoing now through the product life model presented by Vernon (1966), where the author \n\nexplains the different stages of internationalization that depends only on the firm and the \n\nproduct. First, in the introduction stage, the business needs to reach a mature stage on the \n\ndomestic market, being the market where the product was developed. After in the growth \n\nstage, the export activities start to increase, and the firm begins to invest in the manufacturing \n\nof his products in countries where exist an expanding demand for the product. By doing this, \n\nthe company can benefit from economies of scale.  The mature stage is reached when the \n\nforeign market starts being saturated, and the product demand becomes to be standardized, the \n\nmanufacture is moved to the countries where the labor costs are low. In the stage of decline, \n\nthe production and in some cases the demand as well leave the industrial nation goes the \n\ncountry that initial was where the original innovation as begun (Vernon, 1966; McKiernan, \n\n1992). \n\nThe resource-based view (RBV) states that firms follow the path of internationalization for \n\nreasons associated with a cluster of resources that managers can use to create value \n\n(Wenerfelt, 1984). This resources need to be valuable, rare, difficult to imitate by the \n\ncompetitors and have no substitutes ( also known as VRIN attributes), which should result in \n\na long-term competitive advantage (Prahalad and Hamel, 1990).A firm\u2019s assets consist of all \n\ntangible and intangible resources, human and nonhuman, which a company has and with them \n\nenables to create and implement value-enhancing strategies (Wernerfelt, 1995), with an \n\nespecial detail for the intangible resources like human capital and experience that allows to \n\ndevelop in terms of incoming production factors and the creation of competitive advantage. \n\nThe last but not least the eclectic model (also referred as the OLI framework) which analyse \n\nforeign investment activities by ownership advantages (firm\u2019s resources and capabilities, such \n\nas international experience), location advantages (production factors in a specific country, for \n\ninstance the market potential) and internalization advantages (Dunning, 1980). In more detail, \n\nthis last point relays on foreign firm\u2019s capacity to coordinate and manage all activities \n\ninternally (Dunning, 1981). \n\nAlthough these models give us some knowledge about the internationalization process, some \n\nauthors stated that these theories aren\u2019t always suitable to apply when we are trying to explain \n\nthe new internationalization processes. For instance, regarding the Uppsala Model, Madsen \n\nand Servais (1997) give a lot of importance to the role of the networks, and the UM does \n\nconsider this variable for the internationalization process. They defended that firms cannot be \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nanalyzed separately and the level of internationalization of the company depends on intensity, \n\ndegree, and extent of relationship in the network with their foreign partners. \n\nBut the knowledge of the four models mentioned will allow us to have a complete view of the \n\ninternationalization process of the companies in the study to India. \n\n \n\n2.3. ENTRY MODES \n\n \n\nAmong the several explanations of a firm entry mode in a foreign country, it can be defined as \n\n\u201ca structural agreement that allows a firm to implement its product market strategy in a host \n\ncountry either by carrying out only the marketing operations (i. e., via export modes), or both \n\nproduction and marketing operations there\u2026\u201d (Shama and Erramilli, 2004). In other \n\ninvestigations on entry modes connected of the international activity of a firm, it includes \n\nreviews of the choices and consequences of the entry modes, as well the global ownership \n\nlevels (Sharma and Erramilli,2004; Canabal and White, 2008; Hollesen et al.,2011). \n\nThere are a considerable number of theories and surveys on the entry modes with the purpose \n\nof explaining the foreign entry mode decisions (Canabal and White, 2008). Agawal and \n\nRamaswami (1992) illustrate that entry mode alternatives commit four factors: resources, \n\ncontrol, risk, and profit. Also the authors and based on the relation of these variables we can \n\nhave the following entry modes: Exporting is the lowest level of entry mode, which requires a \n\nsmall commitment of resources and a low risk/ return proving an excellent operational \n\ncontrol, which fundamental for market seeking firms strategies. In contrast, the solo venture \n\nmode needs high allocation of resources, meaning that the risk is also going to be high and so \n\nthe control increases too. The joint venture option relatively less resource commitment and \n\nthus the power, risk and return correlates with the equity participation of the firm. Lastly, the \n\nlicensing mode provides the least control to the licensing business and so the allocation of \n\nresources also increases. Is also to understand that the variables control and resources/risk are \n\npositively correlated, once one enhances the other even grows (Agawal and Ramaswami, \n\n1992). \n\nAccording to Ulrich, Hollonsen and Boyd (2014), firms among five possibilities of entry \n\nmodes respecting the level of control, from low to high, being them direct sales, online sales, \n\nagents/distributors, joint ventures/strategic alliances and wholly-owned subsidiaries to the \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nBRIC economies, they found out firms prefer low commitment modes when entering this \n\nmarkets.  The authors state the agent/distributor is the most popular solution in Brazil and \n\nRussia, while direct sales to the customers are as popular in India and China, although the \n\nsubsidiary option is a much more valuable entry mode in China compared to other countries. \n\nThis choice of firms choosing low commitment modes when entering the BRIC economies \n\nit\u2019s not just because they want to reduce market risk, but it\u2019s much more with the purpose of \n\nbuilding a long-term business network and sustaining the developed relationships with the \n\nagents and distributors of the BRIC countries. \n\nBuckley and Casson (1998) also defined entry mode strategy, with a more practical approach. \n\nThe necessary method is to determine the set of all possible market entry strategies, to \n\nmeasure the profitability of each, and to identify the most profitable strategy. The following \n\nissues define the dimensions of the plan set: 1- Where production is located; 2- whether \n\nproduction is owned by the entrant; 3- whether the distribution is owned by the entrant; 4- \n\nwhether the distribution is outright, or shared through an International Joint Venture; and 5- \n\nWhether ownership is obtained through greenfield investment or acquisition. \n\n \n\n2.4. EMERGING ECONOMIES- \u201cBRIC\u201d COUNTRIES \n\n \n\nIn 2001, the acronym BRIC was present by Goldman Sachs (O\u2019Neill, 2001) that stands for the \n\ncountries Brazil, Russia, India, and China and according to the study, this four represent the \n\ndeveloping countries that will have the biggest economies by the year of 2050. Some \n\ninformation we should take into account about is that the BRIC\u2019s population account \n\nrepresents more than 40 percent of the World\u2019s population, yet \u201conly\u201d more or less 20 percent \n\nof the World\u2019s GDP (Wilson, 2003). \n\nThe BRIC countries are quite happy with this status, and for the last couple of years, they \n\nhave organized summits to create common strategies and to have more weight and power on \n\nthe global agenda. All these four countries after the financial crisis in 2008-2009 have \n\nemerged undamaged and reasonably quickly (Aloui, 2011). \n\nAlthough these countries are categorized as a group, among themselves, they have very little \n\nin common. According to Wilson (2003), India and China are manufacturing-based \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\neconomies and big importers, while Brazil and Russia are significant exporters of natural \n\nresources. \n\nGoing even more in-depth on the differences among the BRIC countries, China is in the lead \n\ncompared to Russia, India, and Brazil regarding growth rate. This phenomenon is related in \n\nlarge extent to China\u2019s early focus on focus on ambitious infrastructure projects. Russia is the \n\nodd one among the BRIC\u2019s; its characteristics are entirely different from the others. While the \n\nremaining three all had a demographic boom, counting on a young population for innovation, \n\nRussia has an aging population, and the birth rate is decreasing. His economic success is \n\nfirmly connected to its gas and oil reserves (Ulrich, Hollensen and Boyd, 2014). Brazil is the \n\nonly country that capacity to provide all elements, for instance, manufactured services and \n\nnatural resources supplying (Wilson, 2003). \n\nIn the most recent study from Goldman Sachs (2010), they predict that China is going to \n\nsurpass the USA\u2019s GDP in 2030 and by 2050, India is going to be the second biggest \n\neconomy in the World. Also by 2030, the combined GDP of the BRIC would be more \n\nsignificant than the GDP of the G-7 countries. \n\nAccording to Crespo (2007), foreign direct investment in developing economies has been \n\nviewed over the years as a relevant factor contributing to the development and economic \n\ngrowth. Developing countries can attract more FDI because of their economic growth and \n\ninvestment-friendly policies (Khondoker, 2007). Focusing on the research of Agrawal (2015), \n\nthere is a definite correlation between economic growth and foreign direct investment in \n\nBRIC economies, where various policies to attract inward FDI could become unnecessary, \n\nwhich means that the focus should be to encourage potential sources to sustain economic \n\ndevelopment. \n\nSo concluding, the economic factors are more significant than institutional and political in \n\nBRIC economies, more precisely market size that is measured in the GDP when attracting \n\nforeign direct investment, concerning Jadhav (2012). The author states trade openness is also \n\npositively related to inward FDI and natural resources availability has an adverse effect on \n\ninward FDI, which means that foreign investment is not motivated by resources-seeking \n\npurpose in BRIC economies. \n\nIn the next chapter there will be the continuation of the study regarding this subject of \n\neconomic growth and development, but concentrating the focus in India, the economy chosen \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nby Visabeira, \u00c1guas de Portugal and Efacec to expand their influence and where they decide \n\nto invest. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\n3. MARKET CONTEXT- INDIA \n\n \n\nFor a better understanding of the strategic vision chosen by VisaBeira, \u00c1guas de Portugal, and \n\nEfacec, the author understood it was critical an examination of this yet unusual country for \n\nPortuguese companies to internationalize, that is India. \n\nWith this said, this chapter is going to be divided into three parts: \u201cOverview of India\u201d; \u201cHow \n\ndoes the USA and Europe see India\u201d and \u201cHow does Portugal see India.\u201d This last topic is \n\nalso going to be divided in two, \u201cLuxury market\u201d and \u201cIndia Social Problems,\u201d where the \n\nauthor highlights the importance of these two segments because they are the ones that the \n\ncompanies analyzed want to fit in. \n\n \n\n3.1. OVERVIEW OF THE INDIAN MARKET \n\n \n\nTill recent years, India was not seen as an economic power as we know it today.  It was only \n\nafter the publication of \u201cIndia\u2019s Rising Growth Potential\u201d by Tushar Poddar and Eva Yi \n\n(2007) and then \u201cEM Equity in Two Decades: A Changing Landscape\u201d by Goldman Sachs \n\n(2010) where the incredible influence that the World\u2019s biggest democracy, with more than \n\n1.364 billion of people (World Bank, 2016) and a GDP of about 2.264 trillion US Dollars \n\n(World Bank, 2016), started to be seen by more developed countries as the economic and \n\npolitical power it is and by the opportunities it presents to the World economy.  \n\nA glimpse of the \u201crecent\u201d past, after independence in 1947, India implemented protectionism \n\nlaws and state-interventionism policies which tied up the economy with strict regulations, \n\ndamaging the economic freedom and trade (Poddar and Yi, 2007). The result of these \n\nmeasures was a low grow GDP (appendix 1) for several decades.  Facing this problem, in \n\n1991 the government started implementing economic reforms, were gradually removed \n\nobstacles to economic freedom and allow India to catch up, steadily being again included in \n\nthe global economy.  With this opening to the exterior, \u201csince 2003, India has been one of the \n\nfastest-growing major economies, leading to rapid increases in per capita income, demand, \n\nand integration with the global economy.\u201d (Poddar and Yi, 2007) \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\nCurrently, the country is seen as very appealing to major players for strategic investments \n\nbecause of India\u2019s vast range of industries, expenditures approach, and a supportive \n\ngovernment and especially with a huge and young population (appendix 2 and 3), which is a \n\nhigh driver for demand and an excellent source of the labor force. \n\nThis south Asian nation with the capital in New Delhi is divided into 29 States and 7 Unions \n\ntotalizing 2,973,190 square km of land and has as the head of the government Mr. Narendra \n\nModi, prime Minister since May 26, 2014, and he has been pointed out has  one of the biggest \n\nresponsible for India\u2019s current growth. \n\nFocusing now on the economic factors, India has emerged as the economy with the most \n\nprominent growth rate in the World as we can see in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) \n\nand is predicted to be one of the top economic players in the World in the next 10-15 years, \n\nand by 2050 even being the second most significant World economy, right after China (Moe \n\net al., 2010). According to the World Bank (2016), India has a GDP growth of 7.9% in 2015, \n\nis expected an increase of 6.8% in 2016 and till 2020 is predicted a growth above 7% \n\n(appendix 2). This is one of the biggest economic indicators to attract FDI. (Jadhav, 2012; \n\nUlrich et al., 2014; Agrawal, 2015) The gross value added regarding the composition by \n\nsector is divided in the following way 2016-2017 PE: Services- 51.5%; Industry-31.1%; and \n\nAgriculture-17.4%.The Balance of Payments, also an economic factor that attracts FDI \n\n(Jadhav, 2012) (appendix 7), is contrary with the exports of goods and services being 443 \n\nBillion US Dollars (appendix 6) and the imports reaching almost 530 Billion US Dollars \n\n(World Bank, 2015) (appendix 5). This deficit is also seen as a decisive factor for investors, \n\nand so, since 2000 the foreign direct investment has totalized around 400 Billion US Dollars \n\n(World Bank) and registers the highest number ever in 2016, reaching almost 45 Billion US \n\nDollars (World Bank) (appendix 8). Facing this, the sectors that most attracted FDI were the \n\nservice sector (18%), construction development (7%), computer software and hardware (8%), \n\ntelecommunications (7%), automobile (5%), drugs and pharmaceuticals (4%), chemical (4%), \n\ntrading (4%), power (3%) and hotel and tourism (3%). \n\nFor the future, India and the Asian Development Bank are establishing a strategy for 2018-\n\n2022, with the purpose of creating a stronger middle class and achieving a sustainable \n\neconomic growth. This approach will focus on three main pillars. The first one will develop \n\neconomic competitiveness by creating better and more jobs for better and more qualified \n\npeople through an expanding infrastructure network for transport and energy alongside \n\neconomic agglomerates.  The second Pillar will improve the infrastructure in lagging regions \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nthat need them for systems and social services, especially in rural areas with the target of \n\nrising agricultural productivity and decrease rural-urban income gap. The last Pillar will \n\npromote the renewable resource use in projects designing so that the negative impacts of the \n\nglobal warming can be mitigated. \n\n \n\n3.2. HOW DOES THE USA AND EUROPE SEE INDIA \n\n \n\nEurope and the United States of America are two of most prominent export partners of India \n\nwith the USA responsible for 16% and Europe for nearly 20% Also, this two together \n\ncorrespond to around 27% of FDI in India, since April 2000 till June 2017. US responsible for \n\n6 % and the European Union for 21% (focusing on the leading countries: \n\nUK,7%,Netherland,6%, Germany,3%, Cyprus,3%, France, 2% and a small note for Portugal \n\nthat represents 0.02%, which is around 76 million US Dollars) (appendix 9). \n\nThe reason for this fact is that companies in the areas mentioned above outsource some part of \n\ntheir business line to India, mainly for reasons related with the cheap labor (Kobitzsch et al., \n\n2001; Liu and Trefler, 2008; Flecker, 2015). For instance, the minimum wage in India is \n\naround 60 US Dollars per month (June 2017) which allows the companies to cut cost and \n\nhave more competitive prices.  \n\nAlthough the labor cost is an excellent factor for outsourcing, there are others that also have a \n\nvast weigh in this decision, as the access to knowledge and availability of labor (Flecker, \n\n2015). The rise of the outsourcing in India brought something new, where for the first time \n\neducated US workers are competing with also educated but lower-paid foreign workers \n\n(Kobitzsch et al., 2001). Other advantages are cost saving that is the result of the economies \n\nof scale and corporates can restructure themselves by concentrating on their core business and \n\noutsource service providers and intermediaries (Flecker, 2015). This was the case of European \n\ncompanies that relocated their work to India where they found quickly the resources in need \n\nor to carry out projects at all (Flecker and Kirschenhofer, 2002). \n\nBut this phenomenon is also part of the Indian government strategy that aims to enlarge the \n\nnumber of jobs by creating a World-class infrastructure and establishing economic corridors, \n\nbecause the manufacturing sector can create more jobs per unit of output than services sector \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\nand one the objectives of the government is to reduce the unemployment rate (Asian \n\nDevelopment Bank). \n\nMake in India, as they call it, was introduced by the prime Minister at 15 of August 2014, \n\nwhere he said: \u201cI want to tell the people of the whole World: Come, make in India. Come and \n\nmanufacture in India. Go and sell in any country of the World, but manufacture here. We have \n\nthe skill, talent, discipline and the desire to do something. We want to give the World an \n\nopportunity that come make in India\u201d. The program targets 25 sectors, that include: \n\nautomobiles, aviation, chemicals, IT &amp; BPM, pharmaceuticals, construction, defense \n\nmanufacturing, electrical machinery, food processing, textiles and garments, ports, leather, \n\nmedia and entertainment, wellness, mining, tourism and hospitality, railways, automobile \n\ncomponents, renewable energy, biotechnology, space, thermal power, roads and highways and \n\nelectronics systems.  The incentives are provided by the central government like subsidizing \n\nprojects from companies that invest more than 1 Billion INR (almost 15.5 million US Dollars) \n\nin 15%, export incentives like contract drawback or contract exception schemes and \n\nincentives for particular areas and sectors, and also incentives from the states government that \n\nare different in every state, but some examples of the incentives are the exemption of the land \n\nacquisition, refund or waiver of taxes or companies do not need to pay electricity. This way \n\nthe investment is facilitated, innovation is encouraged and labor skills are developed, uniting \n\nthe conditions to achieve the primary objective of this initiative that is to attract foreign \n\ninvestment and empower India\u2019s manufacturing sector. According to the Asian Development \n\nBank, this project has the purpose of increasing the contribution of manufacturing from 16.5% \n\nof GDP in 2016 to 25% by 2022. \n\nHaving a critical view on this matter, the creation of jobs in the manufacture sector is not a \n\nlong-term solution for India.  Analyzing only in the short term, what this program can do it\u2019s \n\nincredible, since it gives the opportunity for people to move from the agriculture to the \n\nindustrial sector, where the salaries are better paid, and gives the chance of unemployed \n\npeople to have a salary. But what happens, and its one concern of Invest India, is that in the \n\nvalue chain of the final product, only a small part of the value stays in India, where the big \n\npart goes to the developed countries. This will create two problems: first, the deficit of the \n\nbalance of payments will continue to increase and second, this will not enable the creation of \n\na stronger middle class. Efforts have been made by Invest India that companies give better \n\nworking conditions to the workers, especially give better salaries so that employees can \n\ndevelop more consumption habits. \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\n3.3. HOW DOES PORTUGAL SEE INDIA \n\n \n\nEven though Portugal is in Europe, the way Portuguese companies see the Indian market is \n\nnot in the same way as other companies. By not having a strong manufacturing field, \n\ncompared of course with other European countries and also the USA, Portugal targets his \n\nfocus in niche markets, for instance, the luxury market, and in social problems where \n\nPortuguese companies have the knowledge to help India solve them. \n\nStarting with the luxury market, even though India is placed in the seventh position in the \n\nraking of countries with highest GDP (World Bank, 2016) India is also divided into several \n\nstates where the wealth is not equally distributed. For a better understanding about the \n\ndistribution of wealth among Indian people, the Global Wealth Report (2017) creates a \n\nhierarchy where we will only focus on the millionaires that have their wealth bigger than 1 \n\nmillion US Dollars and the ultra-high net worth individuals (UHNWI), which their wealth is \n\nbigger than 30 million US Dollars. According to this study, an UHNWI in India owns more \n\nthan three houses. \n\nIn India, there are around 264300 millionaires in 2016, where 6740 are UHNWI. This last \n\ngroup witnessed a growth of 12% and in the next decade is predicted to increase by 150%. \n\nThis means that in 2026, India is going to be the third country with more UHNWI in the \n\nWorld, right after USA and China. \n\nThe top four Indian cities with more millionaires in 2016 were Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, \n\nand Kolkata. Mumbai its city with more rich people, where itself accounts for 1340 UHNWI, \n\nwhich is almost the double than Delhi (680) has, which earns the second place, followed by \n\nKolkata (280) and Hyderabad (260). The rise of UHNWI is these cities\u2019 regarding 2015 was \n\nalso incredible, reaching values between 10% and 15%. Even these four cities account for \n\n33% of all millionaires in India, again with Mumbai on the top with 46000 people, followed \n\nby Delhi (22700), Kolkata (9600) and Hyderabad (9000). \n\nEven though it doesn\u2019t appear in the study, the author selected Bangalore to close the top five \n\nwealthiest Indian cities. According to City Momentum Index 2017, Bangalore is the World\u2019s \n\nfast-changing city and regarding UHNWI, the growth between 2015 and 2016 it was 15%( the \n\nsame has Hyderabad). The so-called Indian Silicon Valley has attracted a vast number of \n\nWorld\u2019s technology firms, as well as a significant number of successful national start-ups, by \n\ncreating conditions for them to establish there. \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\nNow focusing on the social problems, India has one the most prominent GDP\u2019s in the World, \n\nbut the GDP per capita in one of the lowest, which is almost 1700 US Dollars (World Bank, \n\n2016). There has been done a lot of progress to reduce the poverty rate in the last two \n\ndecades, where the rate decreases from 45.9% in 1993 to 38.2% in 2004 and 21.2% in 2011 \n\n(World Bank, 2016) . Even though we see a considerable reduction, in absolute numbers this \n\nmeans that in 2011 around 268 million people were living with less than 1.90 US Dollars per \n\nday (World Bank 2016). \n\nAlthough we see a decrease in the poverty levels, a large proportion of the population it \n\ncontinues exposed to any economic collapse. Also, the poverty level is not equal spread in all \n\nstates: for instance, about 54% of poor Indian people live in five low-income states (Bihar, \n\nJharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh) (Asian Development Bank, 2016). \n\nAnother point we should take into account his the economic effort in environment and climate \n\nchange matters. Air pollution, cropland degradation, and insufficient water supply are critical \n\ncontributors estimated to cost about 5.7% of the GDP a year (World Bank, 2013). The access \n\nto fresh water is a severe problem since only 3% of the World\u2019s clean water it\u2019s in Indian \n\nTerritory while accounting with 16% of the World\u2019s population. The water resources are \n\nextremely contaminated, where most of the rivers are terribly polluted by uncontrolled \n\ndischarge of garbage and industrial outflow (Mukherji et al., 2012). \n\nThe Indian government is fully aware of this problems, and  in the United Nations Sustainable \n\nSummit 2015 they target these issues. In fact, most of the national government\u2019s flagship \n\nprograms have the purpose of solving them, supervised by a strict attention by the state and \n\nlocal governments regarding the planning, budgeting, developing implementation and \n\nmonitoring systems on these programs. \n\nThe areas where they are focusing their attention are considered priority areas to achieve \n\nsustainable growth in the long term. The areas identified are Smart Cities- development of \n\n100 smart cities that can provide infrastructure and intelligent solutions like efficient energy \n\nsystems, environment-friendly public transportation and green building that can save energy. \n\nThe purpose of this is by 2030 the urban share of GDP increases to 75%; Atal Mission for \n\nRejuvenation and Urban Transformation- The plan is to build infrastructure to the biggest 500 \n\ncities and towns that can provide clean water supply, proper sewerage systems and \n\nmanagement, stormwater drains and adequate public transportation. The government wants \n\nthis project to be complete by 2019; Clean India Mission- The purpose is to increase access to \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\nsanitation services in rural and urban areas so that by 2019 there exists 0% open defecation in \n\nurban areas; Revitalized power sector- this program aims to provide full access to electricity \n\nat affordable, by repair the financial health of energy distribution companies. The objective is \n\nby 2018 every rural area has voltage and by 2019 24x7 power for everyone; Skill India- Aims \n\nto increase the skills of about 400 million people by 2022. Another project that also has a \n\nhuge impact is the cleaning of the Ganges River to allow competent abatement of pollution so \n\nthat the stream can recover. (Asian Development Bank, 2016) \n\nTo conclude, we clearly see the enormous effort of the Indian government to provide \n\nsustainable conditions that give dignity to his population. But they also know the lack of \n\ninternal knowledge that exists in the country, so they want to attract foreign companies to help \n\nthem solve these problems. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\n4. CASE STUDIES \n\n \n\nThe following chapter is going to analyze Efacec, Visabeira and \u00c1guas de Portugal strategy in \n\nthe in the Indian Market. It will be divided into three parts: Outsourcing Strategy; Indian \n\nSocial Problems Strategy; Luxury Strategy. \n\nFor a better understanding for the reader of the approach of each market segment, the author \n\ndecided to separate Vista Alegre Atlantis (one of the companies that belong to Visabeira \n\nInd\u00fastria) from Visabeira Global (appendix 12). Even though they belong to the same \n\ncompany and their internationalization strategy is correlated, their target group is different and \n\nso the way they position themselves also differ. \n\n \n\n4.1. OUTSOURCING- EFACEC \n\n \n\nFounded in 1948, Efacec is a B2B company in the energy, engineering and mobility sector. \n\nBy being present in more than 60 countries, in 2016 the company had profits of 431.5 million \n\n\u20ac. The core business of the company is divided into three areas: Systems, batteries, and \n\nproducts. \n\nIn 2007, Efacec was losing competitiveness to other European companies in the sector and \n\nwas struggling to win it back. The company had to develop a strategy to solve this, otherwise, \n\nthey could go bankrupt. Since increasing the prices of the products wasn\u2019t a solution, because \n\ntheir clients could quickly change to the cheaper products of the competitors, Efacec had to \n\nmove the production facility from Portugal to another country for two reasons: to lower the \n\ncosts and to have a fast and reliable resource of the materials required for the final product. \n\nThere were certain countries that fulfill these requirements, for instance, Western Europe \n\ncountries, Turkey and India. But the increase of inflation and labor cost in the European and \n\nthe political instability in Turkey put aside this two options. Adding to this, in 2007 there was \n\na state mission by the Portuguese president, something that helped Efacec in the \n\ninternationalization process to India. \n\nTo expand for this new country, also because of the high bureaucracy and the difficulty of \n\nfinding a green-field,  Efacec did a partnership with a local company in the sector, and they \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\ncreated two companies, both of them with equal control share for Efacec and the local \n\nbusiness. One of the companies was for outsourcing the products in need by Efacec and \n\nwould be controlled by Efacec, and the other was to sell the products, that were produced in \n\nthe other company, in India that was going to be managed by the local partner. But this wasn\u2019t \n\na good strategy. The company responsible for commercializing the products wasn\u2019t efficient \n\nin doing it, and part of the justification was because the Efacec product wasn\u2019t adequate for \n\nthe Indian market, being considered a premium product.  Facing this management problem, in \n\n2013, Efacec decided to change the strategy and acquire the totality of the outsourcing \n\ncompany, and in exchange, they sold their share of the commercialization company to the \n\nlocal partner. In 2013, was born Efacec India Private Limited, a company 100% Efacec only \n\nwith the purpose of producing Efacec products. \n\nEfacec faces several problems of having a solo company in India. The quality of the final \n\nwork is one of those. Indian patterns of quality, and also regulation, are significantly lower \n\nthan Portuguese ones, demanding by the company a huge resources allocation in giving \n\nformation to their employees that currently are 120 Indian people. Even with this matter, is \n\nstill cost efficient having a factory in India, since in average the producing a product in India \n\nthe costs are 30% lower than producing it in Portugal, with some of the products reaching \n\n50% in cost advantage. Another problem is the Portuguese people Efacec has allocated to \n\nIndia because of the difficulty of managing their expectations regarding living abroad as an \n\nexpatriate. The third issue is the tax system in India, that since the begin of the year of 2017 \n\nthere was a meaningful tax reform that substituted a huge group of indirect taxes, taxes that \n\nused to differentiate products from services and weren\u2019t the same in different states, to only \n\none tax called GST- Goods and Services Tax.  \n\nThe strategy for 2020 is divided in two parts: first to increase the production of the Indian \n\ncompany and second to improve the features of the products. Even though Efacec India \n\ncorresponds 30% to 40% of Efacec total production, the company wants to increase this \n\npercentage to 60% to 70% in order to become more competitive. Also, the company has a \n\nproblem with the customization of the final product to some countries. For instance, there are \n\ncountries where the final product it goes directly from India, like Morocco, and others the \n\nproducts need to go to Portugal to be customized and then go to the last destination, like \n\nAustralia. By doing all of this in India, the company would save resources and lower the \n\ncosts. \n\n \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\n4.2. LUXURY MARKET- VISTA ALEGRE ATLANTIS \n\n \n\nBeing one of the oldest and most known companies in Portugal, Vista Alegre was founded in \n\n1824, and this group produces porcelains for a premium segment. In 2001 the company \n\nmerged with Atlantis, a company that produces crystals, creating Vista Alegre Atlantis. In \n\n2009, the company was bought by Visabeira, and both companies started sharing their \n\ninternationalization strategy. VAA has a physic presence in 13 countries, and itself has made \n\nprofits in 2016 were 75.4 million \u20ac. \n\nWith the state visit of 2017, it was official that Vista Alegre Atlantis was going to expand to \n\nIndia. With an already well-developed analysis of the Indian luxury market, VAA found out a \n\nlarge segment in absolute numbers of people with high demand for their products, and so they \n\nused the state visit to do a partnership with a local player and together they created Shree \n\nSharda Vista Alegre, with an equal share for both members. \n\nThe barriers to enter India where diluted by having a local partner, but this also created some \n\nproblems. One of those is the differences of rhythms of work of the two cultures is too \n\ndifferent, being the Indian one much slower. For instance, the first physical store in Delhi \n\nshould have been opened in September 2017, but because of Indian partner took more time \n\nthan agreed to make internal decisions, the store will only open to the public in December \n\n2017. \n\nSince this is still a recent expansion, the company yet didn\u2019t have the opportunity to prove the \n\nvalue of the Indian market, but the strategy is extremely ambitious. VAA has different plans \n\nto reach the general public and the HoReCa channel. In the B2C approach, VAA wants to \n\nopen more physical shops in strategic cities, where the potential clients live. In the B2B \n\nsegment, the company intends to rely on the website, with strong marketing campaign behind \n\nit. VAA will use the social media to reach their consumers. Also, Word-of-Mouth is a \n\nvaluable tool, since the company is addressing a niche market, the people in this segment \n\nknow each other and so far is the most effective marketing tool. A more long-term strategy, \n\nVAA is using India to enter in other Asian countries, but first, the company wants to grow \n\nstrong and in a sustainable way in India and then address other destinations. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\n4.3. INDIAN SOCIAL PROBLEMS- ADP AND VISABEIRA \n\n \n\n\u00c1guas de Portugal was founded in 1993, and their core business is water treatment. Adp is \n\npresent in 9 countries and by offering services of water supply and sanitation services \n\nmanagement, operation and maintenance of infrastructures, planning and investment \n\nmanagement, strategic studies and training and capacity building, the company reached more \n\nthan 8 million of people all over the World and achieved profits of 646,1 million \u20ac in 2016. \n\nUntil this year, 2017, India wasn\u2019t on the plans of AdP for internationalization destination. \n\nThe strategy was to continue to develop in countries where they on-going projects especially \n\nin Angola and Mozambique, two countries that have a high demand for the services that AdP \n\nprovides and a significant support from the local government. \n\nBut in January, there was organized a state visit to India where the Portuguese prime Minister \n\nand other Ministers travelled together with around thirty managers of Portuguese companies, \n\nand \u00c1guas de Portugal was also in the visit represented by Alexandra Serra, manager director \n\nof \u00c1guas de Portugal Internacional SA, and other managers. In this visit, they had the \n\nopportunity to see several social problems that India faces, but also to know the significant \n\namount of projects develop by the central government with the purpose of solving those \n\nproblems. After encountering this considerable demand for AdP services, when the managers \n\nreturn to Portugal, there was a new mindset with the objective to reorganize the \n\ninternationalization strategy of the company. \n\nGoing a little bit deeper on the reasons that sparkled the choice of this new country for \n\nexpansion, the main factors that had a huge influence on the internationalization decision \n\nwere the demographic and political factor.  Starting with the demographic, with a big \n\npopulation that India has, there are a lot of needs to be satisfied, and some of those are the \n\naccess to clean water and proper sanitation services, two of the most significant problems \n\nIndia faces. To solve these issues, the government developed state-funded programs, called \n\nflagships programs, to target these issues, but because of lack of knowledge and skills, they \n\nalso need foreign partners to address this matter. Two of the flagship programs that got AdP\u2019s \n\nattention was the Smart Cities Mission that was the purpose of renewal the biggest 100 cities \n\nso that they can offer a better quality of life and be sustainable, and the National Mission for \n\nClean Ganga that is a plan to cleaning in a sustainable way the Ganges river. The political \n\nfactor is not only the increase relationships between Portugal and India, with the creation of \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nthe Indian Visa Gold for Indian people that invest in Portugal, but also the Europe and India \n\nthat under the agreement of India-EU Water Partnership, the European Union will help India \n\non the cleaning ganger river mission. \n\nBeing India a country with an enormous demand for AdP services, the company wants to \n\nprovide all his services, but only in the long term. So far, the company is targeting very low-\n\nrisk operations by focusing on the task of technical assistance. The strategy to do these \n\noperations was first to create partnerships with local partners and second to focus in the state \n\nof Goa, where now the company has signed a protocol to work in two priority areas that \n\nbelong to the smart cities program. Also, AdP is applying for an entirely subsidized by the \n\nEuropean Union program called Call 2020, that has the purpose of helping in the cleaning the \n\nGanges River operation. \n\n\u00c1guas de Portugal didn\u2019t find many barriers when trying to enter India since almost all of the \n\nobstacles were diluted by the contacts they made during the state mission and by the \n\npartnership with the local partner, but there are some problems of being in this country. The \n\nfirst one is that Indian people have a different speed of doing tasks, comparing to Portuguese \n\npeople, which doesn\u2019t allow AdP to be as efficient as they wanted to. Another factor is the \n\nfact EU subsidizes some programs in India for water treatment, making it a highly \n\ncompetitive market since other European companies in the water treatment sector also want to \n\ntake advantage of these programs. \n\nFor the future, the company still doesn\u2019t have a structured long-term strategy regarding India, \n\npart of it because it\u2019s still a recent expansion and they are still checking expectations. So far \n\nthey want to win the Call of the Ganges River and be successful in the two pilot projects in \n\nGoa so that they can increase their influence in this state. \n\nIn the same segment selected by the author, Visabeira also fulfills social problems that India \n\npeople face. Founded is 1980, Visabeira is one of the biggest companies in the civil sector in \n\nPortugal with services related to telecommunication, energy, technology, and construction. \n\nVisabeira closed the year of 2016 with profits of 601 million \u20ac, with 3.5 million \u20ac being from \n\ntransactions with India. \n\nBeing dynamics and aggressiveness two words that characterize Visabeira, the company is \n\nalways looking for new countries to expand their influence. Together with this, in 2007 there \n\nwas a Portuguese state mission to India, one of the countries already targeted by the internal \n\ndepartment of internationalization as one country with high demand for Visabeira services \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\nand with tremendous potential to do business, and so the company also joined the state \n\nmission to India. \n\nIn this visit, Visabeira did several contacts that allow the company to do a partnership with \n\nAditya Birla Group, an Indian multinational with several subsidiaries in the civil construction \n\nsector,  and together they created a joint venture called Birla Visabeira Private Limited, a \n\ncompany 50% Visabeira and 50% Birla Group. This is also part of the strategy of Visabeira \n\nwhen facing risky markets. While in Europe they have firms 100% Visabeira, in developing \n\ncountries like Angola and Mozambique, and now India, they do a partnership with a local \n\npartner, something quite \u201ceasy\u201d for Visabeira since they a broad curriculum of collaboration \n\nwith a lot of European telecommunication companies. \n\nThe Birla Visabeira Private Limited focus on telecommunication projects, especially in \n\ninstalling and doing maintenance of optical fiber cables. Recently, Visabeira started doing \n\nconsulting projects in this field since the optical fiber technology is well developed in \n\nPortugal, but it\u2019s quite new in India. \n\nBut by doing business in India, two problems emerge on this fact. The first is the Indian group \n\ngives a lot of trust in the people of Visabeira, and not on the institution itself. This is a huge \n\nconcern because in some cases a small problem that with the European companies could be \n\nclarified by an email, in India sometimes it requires to Visabeira managers to travel there to \n\nsolve it. The second is also something that concerns AdP in their regular basis activities. By \n\nPortuguese and Indian people having different rhythms of work, it is complicated to \n\nharmonize everything and manage the expectations of everyone. The most common problem \n\nis with public contests is that when published, the company stresses to try to fulfill the \n\nrequirements to win it, and then sometimes the contests are postponed to time periods where \n\nthere are no longer are attractive to Visabeira, making them wasting resources unnecessarily. \n\nIn the future, Visabeira wants to continue to grow alongside his partnership and is developing \n\na new strategy where the company will be connected to every part of the value chain in \n\noptical fiber infrastructures, where they will do the planning, construction, and maintenance \n\nof all projects they operate in. Example of that is the construction of an optical fiber \n\nbackbone, which is an infrastructure of many fiber optic cables that together increase the \n\ncapacity of the system, which will have more than 1000 km. Once constructed, the purpose is \n\nto rent it to telecommunication companies. Also, Visabeira is studying the possibility to \n\nexpand to other Asian countries, for instance, China and Indonesia, but this is only part of a \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\nlong-term strategy, and first they want to strengthen themselves in India\u2019s market. To \n\nconclude, since \u00c1guas de Portugal and Visabeira are complementary companies, once the two \n\ncompanies have more influence in the Indian market, they want to create a partnership of \n\nPortuguese companies where AdP does the planning of a water treatment infrastructure and \n\nthem Visabeira will construct it. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\n5. CONCLUSIONS \n\n \n\nThis section of the dissertation will be divided into two parts. The first part will be based on \n\nthe investigation that has been done in the chapters 3 and 4. This section will answer the \n\nresearch questions proposed, focusing on the main points discovered during the analyses of \n\nthe Indian market and the strategy of the Portuguese companies to address that market. The \n\nauthor will also make some recommendations to the companies, based on the information \n\ngathered during the investigation. \n\nThe second part is going to focus on other business opportunities that were not genuinely \n\nanalyzed in this investigation and also in the openings provided particularly by the state of \n\nGoa, because of the historical proximity that it has with Portugal. \n\n \n\n5.1. FINDINGS \n\n \n\n5.1.1. WHAT ARE THE FACTORS THAT ATTRACT PORTUGUESE COMPANIES \n\nTO GO TO INDIA? \n\n \n\nAs suggested by the literature review and them confirmed by the interviews with the \n\nmanagers of the companies, the economic factors, and the political factors have a huge weigh \n\non the choice of India. Since 2003 we have observed an incredible GDP growth with an \n\naverage of 8.3% per year, due to the economic reforms that the Indian Government have \n\nimplemented with the flagship programs, as example Make in India, Smart Cities program, \n\nAtal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, Clean India Mission, Revitalize \n\nPower Sector program and Skill India. These were the primary drivers allowing India to \n\nattract 45 billion US Dollars in 2016 in foreign investment, position the country in the eighth \n\nposition of the countries with highest FDI in the World.  \n\nAlso, the demographic indicators have an impact on the decision of the companies, contrarily \n\nof what was found in the literature. It seems like the fact that India has a population of more \n\nthan 1.3 billion people, where around two thirds in with age between 15 and 35, it represents a \n\nsignificant factor seem is this fact that makes the government invest such substantial amounts \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\nof money the programs already mentioned. As said by the managers, it\u2019s not a factor that \n\nmakes them go to India, by itself not enough for the internationalization process, but together \n\nwith the economic and political factors, it helps in differentiating India  from other previously \n\nconsider countries. \n\n \n\n5.1.2. DO PORTUGUESE COMPANIESHAVE THE CAPACITY TO SATISFY THE \n\nNEEDS OF A COUNTRY LIKE INDIA? \n\n \n\nUnlikely to what the author thought at the beginning of this investigation, the answer to this \n\nquestion is yes. Compared to his European competitors, the Portuguese companies have a low \n\nmanufacture industry in the country and the labor costs in Portugal are also smaller, meaning \n\nthat the need for outsourcing is reduced.  That\u2019s why there was a focus on the other two \n\nmarket possibilities, Indian social problems, and luxury markets, where Portugal was \n\ncompanies capable of fulfilling this needs. The truth is that, for the three different options of \n\ninternationalization, there are three successful cases of internationalization for each option. \n\nVista Alegre Atlantis is positioned themselves carefully in the luxury market with the \n\nporcelains, Visabeira and \u00c1guas de Portugal is targeting the Indian social problems in the \n\ninfrastructure necessities and the water treatment sector respectively and, against the odds, \n\nEfacec has a factory in India to do outsource of part of their products with the purpose of \n\nlower their costs and remain competitive when facing their European competitors. \n\nThis represents an incredible change in the mindset of the managers since in this three so \n\ndifferent market segments there are respectively three Portuguese companies that are \n\nembracing this opportunity and taking advantages out of it, whether is by increasing the \n\nprofits or reducing the cost. In this dissertation, it is proved that Portuguese companies are at \n\nthe same level with European companies when trying to enter the Indian Market. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\n5.1.3. WHAT ARE THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE PATHS FOLLOWED BY \n\nEACH PORTUGUESE COMPANY WHEN INTERNATIONALIZING TO \n\nINDIA? \n\n \n\nWhen comparing the path and strategies of the three companies analyzed, even though their \n\ncore business is in different sectors and also the markets they approach isn\u2019t the same, we can \n\nsee some aspects that are similar between them, such as: \n\nState Mission to India: In 2007, 2013 and 2017 there was a state visit to India, and is also the \n\nyears where Efacec, Visabeira, and \u00c1guas de Portugal, respectively, internationalize to India. \n\nAt a first sign it might seem just a coincidence, but according to the managers of each \n\ncompany, these visits have facilitated the expansion of the three companies. As the companies \n\nwhere represented in each visit, respectively, by internal managers it enabled to make contacts \n\nand to celebrate contracts, which without the all-state visit atmosphere it would be very \n\ndifficult, not to say nearly impossible; \n\n50/50 partnerships: The creation of a new company, 50% of the Portuguese company, 50 % \n\nof a local partner in the sector, is something we see in the three strategies. Even Efacec that \n\nhas a factory 100% of the company, in the beginning, it started with a partnership. This a \n\nnecessary procedure, otherwise the complication with the bureaucracy with the entry in India \n\nwould just create several problems and also would not allow the company to position \n\nthemselves as they want to, being quickly annihilated by the local competitors.  \n\nStarting with low-risk operations: Even though the companies know the incredible \n\nopportunities India has to offer and also the advantages they take from it, they know that a \n\nwrong step might compromise all the process of being successful in India. That why they \n\nchoose to do smaller operations, both in cost and profits so that they can create trust in that \n\nmarket. Only after that, the companies can start target more challenging projects were also the \n\nadvantages are higher. \n\nProblems with the rhythm of work: Having Indian people a different way and speed of \n\nwork comparing to Portuguese ones, it makes difficult to conjugate expectations by both \n\nparts. This represents the biggest problem that the Portuguese companies face, making them \n\narticulate extra costs to confront this issue, both in time and in money. \n\nIncrease influence in India: Is part of the long-term strategy of the three companies to \n\nincrease their projects in India. Vista Alegre wants to expand to other cities, \u00c1guas de \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\nPortugal intends to win the Call of the Ganges River, Visabeira wants to construct the 1000 \n\nkm fiber optical backbone, and Efacec wants to increase their factory to produce even more \n\nproducts in there. The companies are well aware of the possibilities of the India market, and \n\nthey want to take the maximum leverage they can get from it. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.2. RECOMMENDATIONS \n\n \n\nBased on the profound investigation done to the Indian Market in the dissertation and the \n\nunderstanding of the strategy of the companies in India, the author decided to conjugate the \n\nknowledge acquired in these two sections of the investigation to formulate personalized \n\nrecommendations to each company. \n\nStarting with Vista Alegre Atlantis, since is part of the strategy to expand to other cities and \n\ntheir target group is the 1% wealthiest people in India, and considering VAA has already a \n\nshop in Delhi, the author suggest the company to go to Mumbai, where most of the Indian \n\nrichest people live by far when comparing to other cities in India. After increasing their \n\ninfluence in Mumbai, VAA should expand, in this order, to Hyderabad, Kolkata and \n\nBangalore, the cities that complete the top five of the richest cities in India. \n\nFor Visabeira and \u00c1guas de Portugal, the author advises the companies to analyze carefully \n\nthe Mission of Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation and Clean India Mission, two \n\nprograms that are in the water treatment sector that requires the construction of enormous \n\ninfrastructure, where the partnership between the two companies can be successful. \n\nLast but not least, according to Efacec\u2019s managers, the company doesn\u2019t belong to the \n\nprogram Make in India, thus foregoing the opportunity of getting tax benefits and government \n\nsupport that would allow the company to be more cost efficient. As such, the suggestion of \n\nthe author would be for the company to enter in the program since Efacec is the perfect \n\nexample of the companies according to Prime Minister Mondi, when in the presentation of \n\nthis program he said \u201c Go and sell in any country of the World but manufacture here (India)\u201d. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\n5.3. GOA STATE- AN OPTION RATHER THAN A PATH \n\n \n\nThe reason for this topic appears in the conclusion is because the author would like demystify \n\nthe relation between Portugal and Goa as the only way for Portuguese companies enter in the \n\nIndia market. The false common sense exists because Goa is historical connect to Portugal \n\nand this Indian state is considered a mix of the two cultures. As the author analyzed, only Adp \n\nis present in Goa but is already targeting bigger projects, for the cleaning of the Gangues \n\nRiver. The other two companies don\u2019t have any business in Goa and don\u2019t plan to have, \n\nmeaning that a Portuguese company can have success in India without \u201cpass\u201d through Goa. \n\nBut even though these facts, two reasons made the author discriminate this particular state: \n\nthe first is the huge efforts already made between the governments of the two countries to \n\nprovide help for the internalization process in this state, more specifically the Indian Embassy \n\nin Portugal and Portugal India Business HUB, an organization that helps Portuguese \n\ncompanies go to India and vice versa and has offices in Lisbon and Goa, being this the state \n\nwhere they can provide a better service. \n\nGoa is one of the smallest states in India with about 1.5 million people, but with a GDP of 8 \n\nbillion us Dollars, being one of the states with biggest GDP per capita in India. In this western \n\nstate there are two sectors are extremely attractive for Portuguese companies: Tourism and \n\nPharmaceutical sector. \n\nA quick overview on these sectors, the tourism is the largest segment in services sector in \n\nGoa. It is considered a paradise for tourism and that\u2019s why it attracted 680683 tourists in \n\n2016, getting the state on the top 10 of India that attract more tourists. The pharmaceutical \n\nsector is extremely appealing as Portuguese companies carry out a lot of research in the field, \n\nand India already attracts a large number of pharmaceutical companies due to increased \n\nresearch opportunities, as well as the provision of government incentives through the program \n\n\u201cPharma Vision 2020\u201d by the government\u2019s Department of Pharmaceuticals. All these \n\ninitiatives provide partnership and growth opportunities for Portuguese research companies to \n\nexpand into India. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\n5.4. INDIA BEYOND THE STUDIED FRONTIERS \n\n \n\nAs a result of the investigation in the last months about the Indian market, and also as \n\ndiscriminated by the Indian Embassy, several sectors outside the scope of this dissertation \n\nwere identified as extremely attractive for Portuguese companies to explore, but were not  \n\nanalysed in depth as currently there aren\u2019t any National enterprises operating in such sectors. \n\nThe sectors in question are: Defence sector, where around 370 Portuguese companies of \n\ndefence technology have huge opportunities in the Indian market; Energy sector, where \n\nPortugal is the World leader in renewable wind energy; Footwear sector, where shoes moulds \n\nhave a huge demand; agriculture sector, where food processing technology in very advance; \n\nand Information technology sector, where there focus in the two countries artificial \n\nintelligence, algorithms and online platforms. \n\nThe exploration of the sectors listed above can lead to a win-win scenario for both countries. \n\n \n\n5.5. LIMITATION AND FUTURE RESEARCH \n\n \n\nThroughout months of research and hard work, the author was able to provide some \n\nsignificant conclusions, thanks to transparency of the companies interviewed and the \n\norganizations involved. \n\nBut, through the process, there were a couple of limitations that don\u2019t allow the investigation \n\nto reach a unique truth if Portuguese companies can satisfy the necessities of the Indian \n\nmarket. The first is the small sample of companies interviewed that do business in India, what \n\ndoes not grant an equal pattern in other companies. The second is the briefness of the \n\nexpansion of some of the companies investigated, which at this stage do not own financial \n\nevidence of the success of the strategy proposed. \n\nAlso not forgetting the way of the interview was taken and how the questions where \n\nstructured might have misguided the interviewee on his answer and not answering of what the \n\nauthor really wanted. \n\nDespite all of this, the author suggests for future investigations the continuation of this study, \n\nby focusing in other relevant areas and sectors and can also be economically interesting for \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\nPortuguese companies, for instance the energy sector, in more detail the renewable energy \n\nsector and the tourism sector. Also the author would like to see a new analysis on the \n\ncompanies investigated, but in a 5 years\u2019 timeline with the purpose of confirming the \n\nexpectations of the current strategy. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\n6.
