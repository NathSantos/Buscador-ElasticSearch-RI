A total of 16 stratigraphic sections were surveyed along the basin and 120 samples were analyzed. To establish background values we took into account mineralogical and grain-size analyses, faciologic interpretations, geochemical evaluations (by means of aqua regia partial digestion and ICP-OES readings), and the application of statistical techniques (boxplot representations, iterative 2o technique, cumulative frequency curve and calculated distribution function). The results reveal relatively high background values for As, Pb, Mn, Ba, Zn and Ni (respectively 64.2; 43.8; 1636.0; 141.4; 65.3 and 39.0 mg.kg-1). The concentrations of these elements are possibly related to the local geology, being the concentrations higher than these values linked to mining activity in the study region, in special gold mining. On the other hand, the background values established for Fe is lower than the values identified in the majority of the sections analyzed. The background value established for Fe corresponds to a concentration of 8.2%. However, concentrations higher than 48% were identified in the study area. There is a strong evidence of Fe enrichment due to mining at the head of the basin. In conclusion, we can say that the proposed values are important parameters for local environmental/territorial management and may help alerting public managers of the necessity of remediation of certain sites, where anomalous toxic element concentrations are identified.\nKeywords: environmental contamination, heavy metals, reference values, environmental geochemistry and iron mining\nRESUMO\nValores de background para elementos qu\u00edmicos em sedimentos da bacia do rio Gualaxo do Norte,\nMG, Brasil.

Interference of natural distributions and alterations caused by anthropogenic activities is an important issue, with important implications in geological, toxicological and biologic studies. This is especially important when dealing with geochemical analyses of toxic elements.\nAs discussed in Reimann and Garret (2005), there is no clear definition for the term geochemical background. However, many authors, including Matschullat et al. (2000), Reimann et al. (2005) and Galuszka (2007), define geochemical background as a reference to distinguish natural concentrations of a certain element from the concentrations affected by anthropogenic activities, considering temporal and spatial variables of the area under investigation. For these authors, the establishment of geochemical background values for certain elements is crucial, because it enables the separation of geogenic contributions to a certain environment (i.e., waters, soils, sediments, plants) from those of anthropogenic origin. Once these values are established, it is possible, for example, to elaborate geochemical maps focusing on the geoenvironment. These maps are considered important tools to territorial management and can be turned into alert guides to public managers, warning them on the necessity of remediation of sites where anomalous concentrations of toxic elements are identified.\nThere are a large number of methodologies to establish geochemical background values, which are recurrent in several studies (Matschullat et al., 2000; Reimann et al., 2005; Galuszka, 2006; Mrvic et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011). Among the methods that are usually used in studies involving the determination of the background of chemical elements, direct (geochemical) and indirect (statistical) methods stand out.\nThe geochemical method is based on the analysis of samples known to be free of anthropic inter\nference (Crommentuijn, et al. 2000; Baize and Sterckeman, 2001; Horckmans et al., 2005). Background values are determined using mean metal concentration values obtained for an area or sedimentary deposit that has not undergone anthropogenic interference. The indirect method, also named statistical method, demands the specific knowledge of exploration methods for which the relationship cost/surveyed area is preferably low. The intrinsic characteristic of such method is the use of finite statistical samples, which constitute the whole or part of a population represented by samples effectively collected and from which the required quantitative data are obtained (Frizzo etal., 2007). By means of procedures or statistical techniques performed by appropriate softwares, the data set relative to different chemical elements is analyzed and from this analysis it is possible to interpret the data and make considerations and inferences on the sampled population and consequently on the study area. Among the statistical methods, the following have been widely applied: the iterative 2o technique, the cumulative frequency curve in linear scale, boxplot representations, histograms, among others (Teng et al., 2009; Costa et al., 2010; Peh et al., 2010; Mrvic et al., 2011; Zglobicki et al, 2011; Mrvic et al, 2012).\nHowever, difficulties are encountered when trying to establish a system comprehensive enough to encompass reference patterns for heavy metals, in order to evaluate areas suspected to be contaminated. Such difficulties result from the lack of systematic studies and mainly of particularities intrinsic of each study area. In Brazil, a few studies have been developed with the objective of understanding and/or differentiating the influence of geogenic and anthropic contributions in the dynamics of contaminating elements. Despite some studies exist that put in evidence the presence of heavy metals in fluvial sediments (Lewin and Macklin, 1987; Taylor and Lewin, 1996; Brewer and Taylor, 1997; Eleut\u00e9rio, 1997; Costa, 2001; Costa et al, 2010), studies that aim at establishing reference patterns for such elements are scarce, in particular when the objects of study are deposits formed at different times, such as recent and older sediments (cutbanks and alluvial terraces, respectively). The establishment of geochemical background values taking into account not only the chemical element concentrations, but also geologic, faciologic and mineralogic characteristics, has not been very much practiced. In Brazil pioneer studies applying this approach were carried out only by Costa (2007) and Costa et al. (2010).\nIn this context, this work aims at establishing local geochemical background values for Fe, As, Pb, Mn, Ba, Zn and Ni, using sediments from cutbanks and alluvial terraces of the Gualaxo do Norte River basin, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The anthropic activity in the Gualaxo do Norte River area is intense, particularly iron ore and gold mining, the latter having been practiced in the last 300 years. We hope that this study can contribute for the elaboration of environmental and public health political plans, which can minimize the impacts caused by mining activities in the study region.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nSamples from eight cutbanks and eight alluvial terraces located along the Gualaxo do Norte River basin were collected. The head is northeast of Ouro Preto and northwest of Mariana (Fig. 1). The basin crosses several units of the Quadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero, which is considered one of the largest and well-known areas for mineral deposits of the world, and one of the most important mining regions of Brazil (Deschamps et al, 2002; Roeser and Roeser, 2010). The Gualaxo do Norte River spring is situated in the domain of the Minas Supergroup supracrustal rocks, i.e. quartzites, itabirites and phyllites, whereas its\nmedium and lower courses run through the Santa B\u00e1rbara, Acaiaca and Mantiqueira Metamorphic Complexes, and also the Rio das Velhas Supergroup schists and quartzites (Costa, 2001).\nAt the locations where cutbank and alluvial terrace deposits were identified (Figure 1) sections were drawn documenting the facies, similarly to the method adopted by Costa et al. (2010). Sediment samples from all strata were collected for grain-size, mineralogical and geochemical analyses, totaling 120 samples. To determine chemical element concentrations, fractions of grain-size less than 63 pm were partially digested with aqua regia, following Rauret et al. (1999) and Shiowatana et al. (2001) recommendations. The analyses were carried out at the Environmental Geochemistry Laboratory (Degeo/UFOP), by means of atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-OES - Spectro, model Ciros CCD).\nFor C14 dating, samples of carbonaceous material found in some stratigraphic sections were collected. C14 dating was performed by the Radiocarbon Laboratory of the University of Waikato of New Zealand (equipped with an Accelerator Mass Spectrometer). It is worth mentioning that the geochronologic data thus obtained helped correlate the anomalous chemical element concentration levels with the deposition age, making the understanding of the relationship between these values and mining activities in the study area possible.\nGualaxo do Norte river\nTributaries\nGeographical boundary of the basin\nMunicipal seat\nSampling points (stratigraphic profiles)\nFigure 1. Geographic location of the Gualaxo do Norte River basin, Minas Gerais, Brazil, and sampled points.\nIt is important to stress that all the analyses were useful in the recognition of anthropogenic influence in chemical element concentrations. Efforts were made to eliminate biases that could cause overestimation of the results obtained. Samples from sediments that were known to have been affected by anthropogenic activities were analyzed separately from those with no evidence of anthropogenic metal enrichment. Prior to the application of the specific techniques for the determination of background values, the original data consisting of chemical element concentrations were treated by means of a descriptive exploratory analysis. This step was necessary in order to check the statistical and mathematical properties of the data,\nas recommended by Burrough et al. (1996). In the present study the following descriptive exploratory techniques were adopted: tests for normality (Anderson-Darling, Lilliefors, Kolmogorov-Smirnov), mean, median, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, dispersion graphs, histograms, parametric and non-parametric tests for mean comparison, among others. All these techniques helped identifying trends, discrepant points, distribution types, choose the analysis to be applied and characterize variability.\nSpecific techniques were chosen for the determination of local geochemical background values. Because many techniques can be used in geochemical background studies and because all of them have advantages and disadvantages, more than one statistical technique was applied in this work, such as: boxplot representations, iterative 2o technique, cumulative frequency curve and the calculated distribution function. The use of some of these techniques can be observed in the following studies: Panno et al. (2006), Diez et al. (2007), Mic\u00f3 et al. (2007), Gal\u00e1n et al. (2008), P\u00e9rez-Sirvent et al. (2009), Teng et al. (2009), Costa et al. (2010), Nakic et al. (2010), Peh et al. (2010), Guill\u00e9n et al.(2011), Mrvic et al. (2011) and Zglobicki et al. (2011).\nThe results obtained from the application of different techniques were analyzed and the background values were established from the arithmetic mean of the values obtained by each technique. Such decision was based on the method adopted in Zglobicki et al. (2011). It is stressed out that the statistical techniques adopted in this work are similar to those adopted by Zglobicki et al. (2011). Four statistical techniques were used to establish the background values, namely: boxplot representations (Tukey 1977), cumulative frequency curves (Lepeltier, 1969; Matschullat et al, 2000), iterative 2o technique (Erhardt et al, 1998; Matschullat etal., 2000) and calculated distribution function (Matschullat etal, 2000). A detailed description of the statistical techniques used is given below, followed by the results obtained for Fe, As, Pb, Mn, Ba, Zn and Ni.\nStatistical Methods\nBoxplot representations\nThe method proposed by Tukey (1977) was adopted to define background values by means of boxplotrepresentations. Initially, ranges were determined by delimiting the interquartile (IQ) range augmented\n1.5\ttimes. From the range thus obtained the background value was considered as the upper limit given by [UL=Q3+1/2(1.5IQ-IQ)], where UL = upper limit and Q3 = upper quartile. The Minitab\u00ae software was used to draw the boxplot representations.\nCumulative frequency curves\nThe establishment of background values for the chemical elements chosen was also carried out using an approximation of the Lepeltier (1969) statistical method, which is the cumulative frequency curves in linear scale, as also proposed by Matschullat et al. (2000). In a general way, the original data are plotted in a spreadsheet and the curves are drawn by a statistics software (in this case, Minitab\u00ae). For the analysis of the curves and subsequent establishment of background values, the procedure proposed by Costa et al. (2007) was taken as a basis, which helps to evaluate variations in the data populations by means of inflexion points in the curves. The following cases occurred in the present study:\n1.\tTwo inflection points: This clearly indicates the existence of three distinct data populations. In this case, a range is defined from the lower to the upper inflection points. This range represents the most homogeneous data of the whole data set and the background value is defined as the upper limit of this range.\n2.\tMultiple inflection points: The presence of several populations is observed in this case. Their characteristics may have been influenced by natural or anthropogenic factors. The establishment of background values must take into consideration the homogeneity of the data within each defined population. In other words, the background population will be that most representative of the whole data set and the background value will be the upper limit of such population.\n3.\tIterative 2o technique: According to Erhardt et al. (1998) and Matschullat et al. (2000), the iterative 2o technique [mean \u00b1 2o| is mainly used to define background values because it approximates the original data set to a normal distribution. In practice, the technique consists in the calculation of the mean and the standard deviation (o) of the data set. After that, all the values outside the range [mean \u00b1 2o| are excluded. Such procedure is repeated until all the values of the remaining data set are constrained to the range [mean \u00b1 2o| (Matschullat et al., 2000). This range is then considered the background range for the analyzed element and the background value is the upper limit of this range.\nTo apply this technique the freeware Visual Basic macro entitled VB Background\u00ae (MS Excel) and developed by Nakic et al. (2007) was used. According to these authors, VB Background\u00ae, as it incorporates algorithms of the iterative 2o technique, allows the automated treatment of the geochemical data, making the generation of background values for chemical parameters possible. At the same time, the macro generates a graphic representation that helps the interpretation of the data.\nCalculated distribution function\nThe calculated distribution function, as described by Matschullat et al. (2000), aims at defining the upper limit of natural concentrations. The use of such technique is recommended when anthropogenic activities tend to cause enrichments in the natural systems, causing positive anomalies shown in a distribution function as a positive asymmetry of a normal curve (Nakic et al, 2007). The lowest values must therefore be free of anthropic influence (Matschullat et al, 2000). For the application of this technique the macro VB Background\u00ae was also used.\nAlgorithms based on the calculated distribution function are used to calculate the median of the original data set and all the values above the median are eliminated. Then, VB Background\u00ae \u201cmirrors\u201d all the remaining values against the calculated median value, according to: [\u201cmirrored\u201d value = median - value of each datum + median] (Nakic et al., 2007). The macro calculates the mean and the standard deviation for the prepared data and the range [mean \u00b1 2o|. After calculating [mean \u00b1 2o], all the values outside the calculated range are excluded. Next, the macro calculates the accumulated normal distribution for the new mean and the standard deviation. Finally, the macro generates a graph showing a histogram (for the original data and the background range), as well as the cumulative frequency curve for the original data and background and the normal distribution curve.\nIt is worth mentioning that both the iterative 2o technique and the calculated distribution function\nhave the advantage of not requiring that the combined (processed) total data follow normal or log-normal distribution, and can be applied to a relatively small data set (n > 30) (Nakic et al., 2007). Besides, both techniques calculate the normal range of background values with 95% confidence. The macro VB Background\u00ae supplies the T and critical T (Tcrit) values from the Lilliefors (1969) normality test, which is an adaptation of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov procedure. The application of such techniques is considered valid only when T is lower than T If T is higher than T the number of anomalous samples is larger or equal to the number of background samples, which means that the background values are overestimated.\nFor some elements the statistical techniques were applied to the whole data set with no distinction between those coming from the cutbanks or from alluvial terraces, whereas for others, the data were analyzed separately.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nRegarding Fe, samples unaffected by anthropogenic interference were chosen. Mining upstream the Gualaxo do Norte River basin causes increase in Fe concentrations in sediments. The samples were collected in the T07A, T07B and T09 terraces for which C14 dating of carbonaceous material revealed ages older than 80 years (Figure 2). This age is previous to the installation of iron ore mining activities, which started approximately 40 years ago in the basin.\nfHHi\nLEGEND\nC - Gravel\nA MG - Very coarse sand AG - Coarse sand\nAM - Medium sand AF - Fine sand\nAMF \u2022 Very sine sand\nS/A - Silt and clay\n\u2022 Carbonaceous material\nSand\nSand with ripples\nSilt and clay\nSand with pebbles and gravels\nPebbles and gravels\nStratification parallel plan\n\u00bfFining upward sequence\n\u25a1\nSamples\tSample 1 (T07A)\tSample 2 (T07B)\tSample 3 (T09)\nResults from dating\t105 \u00b130 BP\t131 \u00b10.5 BP\t81 \u00b130 BP\nFigure 2. Alluvial terraces used to establish the background range for Fe and the results of C14 dating of carbonaceous materials.\nOnce the samples to be analyzed were chosen, the statistical techniques to determine the background range were applied, excepting the cumulative frequency curve. Such technique was discarded since it is not recommended for a sample sets with n &lt;50 (Matschullat et al, 2000). The values obtained for Fe and other elements are presented in Table 1.\nTable 1.

In the specific case of the study area, there are evidences that an increase of iron in fluvial sediments is related to iron ore mining activities located upstream. Leakage from Fe oxide-rich tailings causes Fe enrichment in sediments along the basin's main water course. Higher Fe concentrations were detected in the bank sediments of the main river (>20%), when compared to the Fe concentrations in the sediments of its tributaries (<12%) (data not discussed in this article). Visual observation reveals the deposition of dark, fine sediments rich in Fe oxides along the basin's main river and not along its tributaries.\nThe establishment of background values for As was based on three statistical techniques: cumulative frequency curve, iterative 2o technique and calculated distribution function, applied to the whole sample set (no distinction between cutbanks and terraces). The boxplot representation was not used because, according to Reimann et al. (2005), it is more informative when the number of outliers is less than 10%. In our case, the number of anomalous samples represented 13.6% of the total analyzed for As, thus making the use of this technique less usefull.\nIt is necessary mentioning that all samples of all sections were used for the establishment of the background value for As, as no geochronological data were available to justify selection of samples. Samples older than the historical gold mining activities were not identified, although As concentrations in the alluvial terraces T07A, T07B, T08 and T09 were not directly or indirectly related to anthropogenic activities (Table 1).\nThe relatively high As concentrations (up to 64.2 mg.kg-1) (Table 1) can be linked to natural As enrichment, possibly originated from the presence of sulfides, sulfoarsenides and arsenides such as arsenopyrite, which is common in the study area. Besides, As can also be associated with the crystalline structures of primary minerals, silicates or aluminates, constituting an inert or residual fraction of the sediments. However, it is important to stress out that anomalous As concentrations were identified, and could be related to historical gold mining activities. In this case, As sulfide-enriched tailings would be\nmade available from source areas associated with gold mineralization and enriched in deposition areas downstream.\nThe anomalous As concentrations were identified in facies characterized by the presence of strati-graphically disordered gravels and boulders, where predominant minerals are quartz, magnetite, hematite, feldspar, gibbsite, kyanite and tourmaline. These facies are interpreted as canals with direct or indirect interference of mining activities such as digging or dredging. The excellent sorting of coarse grains observed in these facies is not expected from natural processes operating in fluvial systems. Such sorting resulted from rudimentary techniques such as the use of transversal dikes to break the water course, which forced the dredged sediments to deposit, washing the heavier sediment in the pans or carpets. Moreover, such sorting can also result from rudimentary mining by means of picking, where gravel is also separated. In the study region bombs were intensely used to remove fine sediments and force canal deviations.\nAs for arsenic, the establishment of background values for Pb was based on the cumulative frequency curve and iterative 2o techniques, using all the analyzed samples (cutbanks and terraces). The boxplot representation, in this case, was not used, since the number of outlier values corresponded to 24% of the data set, making the use of this technique less usefull (Reimann et al, 2005). The calculated distribution function technique was discarded due to T being higher than T The background values are presented in table 1.\nPb concentrations up to 43.8 mg.kg-1 can be of natural origin, specifically related to the host rocks (Rio das Velhas Supergroup) of gold mineralization, associated with sulfide veins. On the other hand, it is possible that the concentrations higher than this value are related to human activities causing Pb enrichment in fluvial sediments. The observation of high Pb concentrations in all samples (median of 81.1 mg.kg-1) collected in sections located in the head of the basin (B01, B02, T01 and T02) corroborates the hypothesis of Pb enrichment due to gold and iron ore mining. Both As and Pb occur naturally in the rocks hosting the gold mineralization, associated with sulfide veins exposed when the mines are open for gold extraction. Besides, Pb can also be associated with galena (PbS), which occurs in deposits associated with Fe. The strong correlation between Fe and Pb (p=0.97) seen in section T01, for example, attests for this hypothesis (Table 2). In section T03, the strong positive Fe-Pb correlation and the weak correlation with other elements (Table 3) show a pattern similar to the observed in terrace T01. In addition, Pb can be associated with Fe and Mn oxides-hydroxides that envelope clay particles, as indicated by the strong correlation between Al and Pb concentrations (p>0.85) (the clay particles present aluminosilicatic composition).\nTable 2.

The choice of these terraces is justified by the fact that they are older than the Miguel Congo manganese mine exploitation (intensely mined in the 1980's), localized in the upper Gualaxo do Norte River basin. The data were analyzed via the iterative 2o technique and the calculated distribution function. The boxplot representation was discarded, once anomalous values represented more than 12% of the total data set related to the alluvial terraces, making the use of this technique impossible. The frequency curve was discarded because the number of samples analyzed was less than 50.\nIt is considered as local background value for Mn the concentration of 1,636 mg.kg-1. It is important to stress out that Mn concentrations are usually high in the study area and are mainly associated with Fe occurrences, being such elements siderophile or lithophile. The Mn exploitation in the Miguel Congo mine corroborates to the hypothesis that high Mn concentrations are natural in the basin. However, it is worth mentioning that concentrations higher than the established background value can be directly linked with anthropic activities, which can mobilize Mn to the environment during and after mining operations. The median Mn concentration for the samples from the stratigraphic sections of the basin's upper course was 12,180 mg.kg-1, whereas in the sections located farther from the head the median was 1,040 mg.kg-1. A concentration higher than 26,000 mg.kg-1 was found in the upper stratum of cutbank B01 (set 30-38 cm), located in the basin's upper course.\nAs for Mn, background values for Ba were obtained using the samples from terraces T07A, T07B and T09, once they are older than the Mn mining in Miguel Congo. In the sections of this part of the basin (T01, T03, B01 and B02) a strong correlation was observed between Ba and Mn (p > 0.81). Such correlation could justify the availability of both elements in the sediments as a consequence of mining. High Ba concentrations were observed in all points sampled in the basin's upper course, as shown by Costa (2001), when investigating canal and flood plain sediments. The author attested high Ba concentrations (from 458.0 to 655.0 mg.kg-1) in all points sampled in the upper course of the Gualaxo do Norte river basin. Besides, Cabral et al. (2002) report the existence of Mn minerals with important Ba contents in the Quadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero, which corroborates to the hypothesis of a common origin for these elements.The data were treated applying the following statistical techniques: iterative 2o and calculated distribution function. The boxplot representation and cumulative frequency curve were discarded for the same reasons presented for Mn. The proposed background values are given in table 1.\nBa concentrations up to 141.4 mg.kg-1 may be linked to the natural presence of the element, which\ncomplexes with clays (kaolinite and montmorillonite) and Fe or Mn oxides-hydroxides. However, concentrations higher than this value seem to be related to gold occurrences, as mining plays an equally important role in increasing Ba in sediments (Table 1).\nThe establishment of background values for Zn was made by means of the four statistical techniques mentioned before and using the whole sample set. The use of all samples is justified because Zn concentrations in the cutbanks and alluvial terraces do not show statistically significant differences (p = 0.29) according to the Mann-Whitney test. The background value established for Zn is 65.3 mg.kg-1. Concentrations up to this value can be associated with the occurrence of sulfide-bearing rocks containing chalcopyrite and galena. On the other hand, concentrations above the established background value could be explained by enrichment caused by anthropogenic activities, especially gold mining, which also mobilizes the element to fluvial sediments. According to Rodrigues-Filho and Maddock (1997), in gold mining areas during ore beneficiation, dense elements such as Zn can be concentrated, causing the contamination of waters and sediments.\nAlso for Ni, the background values were established applying the four techniques previously described and using all samples analyzed. The background value established for Ni is 39 mg.kg-1. Ni is a siderophile element, found in more than 80 minerals, relatively high concentrations occurring in ferromag-nesian minerals and sulfides, which are common in the study area.\nTo determine and distinguish the geogenic or anthropogenic origins of the concentrations of chemical elements in the ecosystem is of relevant importance, once they can attest actions in favor of environmental conservation and remediation, in cases of contamination or contamination potential. In this sense, studies that aim at proposing background values are necessary to decision making directed to the environmental issues. Not knowing them may cause under- or overestimation of the significance of contamination levels in a certain area (Hursthose, 2001).\nHowever, these same studies present peculiarities that many times lead to polemic and hard criticism. Such peculiarities are mainly related to the diversity of methods that can be used in the establishment of background values (and that vary from researcher to researcher) and the scarcity of studies, which many times make the comparison of results reported in the few existing works difficult or even impossible. As discussed by Poleto and Merten (2008), this difficulty increases due to the impossibility of a universalization of proposed values, because they are exclusive to a study area. Significantly high values can be obtained for a certain area and not for another, simply because of mineralogic/geologic differences in each of them, fact that makes it not meaning reliable to use data produced in other regions or countries.\nWhen it comes to fluvial sediments, the lack of local, regional or national studies for the establishment of background values is even more important, due to the recognition that the majority of the few existing works establish background values for soil and water. In Brazil there is not a specific legislation that deals with toxic element or organic contaminant levels for the protection of the aquatic life that is valid throughout the Brazilian territory or at least in some states. Only one pioneer work named QualiSed, developed by researchers of the S\u00e3o Carlos Federal University (UFSCar), Campinas Statal University (Unicamp) and the S\u00e3o Paulo State Environmental Sanitary Technology Company (CETESB), is cited here. QualiSed aimed at collecting preliminary data for the Guide Values for Sediment Quality (VGQS) for metals and xenobiotic organic compounds (Mozeto, 2003). The data set gathered in this study formed\nthe basis for the project named Integrated and Hierarchic Evaluation of the Sediment Quality (AIHQS), in which VGQS in use in Canada and USA were employed as guides to certain actions (physical, chemical, biologic and ecotoxicologic analyses) taken at the different steps of the decision tree.\nDespite QualiSed, there are no regulated and validated VGQS by Brazilian official environmental agencies. The legal instrument that is close to this \u201cregulation and validation'\u201d is the #344 resolution of the National Environment Council (CONAMA). Such resolution was created aiming at establishing general guidelines and minimal procedures for the evaluation of the material to be dredged and the managing of it disposal (CONAMA, 2004). In the resolution two levels or limits for the material to be dredged are fixed: level I, which refers to a threshold below which low probability of adverse effects to the biota are expected, and levelII, which refers to a threshold above which a probable adverse effect to the biota is expected. However, due to the lack of Brazilian studies that could support the proposal of national threshold values and the fact that this resolution is exclusively based on international recommendations, such as Canadian and North American, such resolution is faulty and in many cases the suggested VGQS do not reflect the Brazilian reality.\nInternationally some studies have proposed VGQS, which in practice are scientific tools that synthesize information on the relationships between pollutant concentrations in sediments and any adverse effect resulting from the exposure to contaminants. Such studies have been conducted by several federal, statal or provincial agencies, moreover in North America for fresh water and coastal and marine ecosystems. As reviewed by Silv\u00e9rio (2003), several VGQS can be found in the literature for metals in aquatic sediments: i) partition equilibrium (VGQS of the volatilizable sulfides by acidification and interstitial waters) (Ank-ley, 1996); ii) SEL (severe effect level) and LEL (lowest effect level) (Persaud et al., 1993); iii) ERL (effect range-low) and ERM (effect range-median) (Long and Morgan, 1991); iv) TEL (threshold effect level) and PEL (probable effect level) (Smith et al., 1996); v) AET (apparent effect threshold) (Alden and Rule, 1992); vi) TEC (threshold effect concentration) and PEC (probable effect concentration) (MacDonald, 2000), and vii) LRM (linear regression model) (Field et al, 1999).\nThe VGQS proposed by the legislation of Canada (CCME, 2001), North America (USEPA, 2003) and Brazil (CONAMA, 2004) are presented in Chart 1 together with the background values proposed by Crommentuijn et al. (2000) (used by the Dutch government) and those proposed by Costa (2007), which are values obtained for the Ribeir\u00e3o do Carmo basin, also in the Quadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero, using flood plain and alluvial terrace sediments. This last study is closest to our study region. As can be seen in Chart 1, there is a large variation regarding the values proposed by the different studies when compared to local background ranges proposed here. These differences specifically reflect the distinct natural or anthropized characteristics of the study areas, for which the values were proposed. Therefore, the comparison of the background ranges proposed here in relation to the values established by other studies is limited or inadequate to enable a classification of the concentrations obtained in this study.\nChart 1.

(1995) and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP, 1994).\n3The numbers indicate the average and the maximum value (in brackets) of the obtained concentrations. (-): values not established or not found in the literature.\nArsenic is good example of the limitation and difficulty in comparing these data. The background value proposed here for As encompasses values that can represent adverse effects to the biota (>17 mg.kg-1), both by the Canadian and Brazilian legislations, once it is 64.2 mg.kg-1. Concentrations up to this value are considered basal and naturally present in the study area. The concentrations higher than \u201cPEL\u201d and \u201cLevel 2\u201d and that are directly related to the geologic characteristics of the region where the Gualaxo river basin is installed. As already commented, the natural As enrichment can be related to the rocks hosting the gold mineralization, which are associated with sulfide veins exposed when the mines are open for gold extraction. On the other hand, in relation to the Background Concentration (CB) proposed by Crommentuijn et al. (2000) (29 mg.kg-1), this refers to approximately half of the value proposed in the present study. According to the authors, all the values proposed represent the percentile 90 of non-polluted\nareas, which suggests that As enrichment in the study regions are natural. The difference basically consists of the fact that whereas concentrations larger than 29 mg.kg-1 are considered abnormal by Crommentuijn et al. (2000), in the present study concentrations up to 64.2 mg.kg-1 may not be related to human activities.\nIt is possible to compare, even with caution, studies developed in areas of similar geological characteristics. For example, high As concentrations observed by Costa (2007) in gravelly samples were also observed in the present study. Costa (2007) and our study, present similar characteristics and have been developed in neighboring regions, differences are perceived, which once again attests the difficulty in comparing results. Another example is given by As concentrations in the clayey facies. The present study evidenced higher As concentrations when compared to Costa (2007). A mean concentration of 276.1 mg.kg-1 (27 times higher) and median of 238 mg.kg-1 were obtained for clayey sediments. Besides, whereas the maximum concentration obtained by Costa (2007) in such sediment was 241.2 mg.kg-1, we obtained a maximum concentration of 570 mg.kg-1.\nIn light of the exposed above, the development of local or regional background studies, especially when it comes to sediment contamination, are necessary and important. From a practical viewpoint, the results here presented are an alert for the authorities responsible for environmental managing, moreover when there is evidence, even if natural, of high concentrations of highly toxic elements such as arsenic, which indicate potential risk to human health.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe proposed background values are coherent with the local geologic characteristics, which must be taken into account both by environmental agencies (for pro-environmental decision making) and the academic community, in face of the necessity of continuing studies (in other areas) using the approach presented here. In order to propose background values, it is important to know the geology of the study area, so that biases, which can cause over or underestimation of the proposed values, are eliminated. Finally, the choice of the method to be used must be related not only to the geologic knowledge of the area, but also to the distinct deposition sites chosen for sampling. It is important to identify whether the sample was taken from old (possibly free of anthropogenic interference) or recent environments, in which anthropic activities can directly or indirectly affect the concentration of certain elements.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors wish to thank the Brazilian Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) (Projects 577211-2008-0 and 476881-20072), the Program for Support of Excellence Nuclei (PRONEX) linked to the Minas Gerais Foundation for Research (FAPEMIG) (CRA-APQ-00415-09), and the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) for the doctorate scholarship granted to the first author.\nREFERENCES\nANKLEY, G.
