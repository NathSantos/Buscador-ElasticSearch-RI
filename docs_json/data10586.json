A \n\ninvestiga\u00e7\u00e3o foi realizada utilizando dados coletados no campo entre 2014 e 2016, incluindo, \n\nas POIs, componentes opticamente significativos (COSs) e reflect\u00e2ncia de sensoriamento \n\nremoto (???). Os dados apresentados dos COSs confirmaram que BB \u00e9 um ambiente mais \nt\u00farbido que Nav por apresentar maior produ\u00e7\u00e3o fitoplanct\u00f4nica em fun\u00e7\u00e3o do recebimento de \n\naltas cargas de nutrientes provenientes da bacia de drenagem. Por outro lado, Nav \u00e9 um \n\nambiente mais transparente e com maior influ\u00eancia de material inorg\u00e2nico, o que favorece o \n\nsurgimento de macr\u00f3fitas submersas. A concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de clorofila-a (Chl-a) em BB alcan\u00e7ou \n\nm\u00e1ximo de 797.8 \u00b5g l-1 em outubro/2014, enquanto Nav apresentou m\u00e1ximo de 38.6 \u00b5g l-1 em \n\nmaio/2016. A variabilidade nos COS esteve altamente vinculada a frequ\u00eancia de chuvas, sendo \n\nque no ano de 2014, ocorreu um evento extremo de seca alterando as caracter\u00edsticas \n\nbiogeoqu\u00edmicas dos ambientes. BB reagiu de forma mais abrupta que Nav por apresentar um \n\nsistema de opera\u00e7\u00e3o do tipo acumula\u00e7\u00e3o e por estar mais pr\u00f3xima das regi\u00f5es potencialmente \n\npoluidoras, diferente de Nav que apresenta um sistema fio-d\u2019\u00e1gua em que n\u00e3o h\u00e1 acumula\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ne sim fluxo constante da \u00e1gua. Al\u00e9m disso, no \u00e2mbito \u00f3ptico, a absor\u00e7\u00e3o em Nav apresentou \n\nmaior influ\u00eancia do particulado n\u00e3o-algal (NAP) enquanto que em BB, a absor\u00e7\u00e3o foi dominada \n\npor fitopl\u00e2ncton. Com base nesses resultados pode-se concluir que os dois ambientes \n\napresentam n\u00e3o s\u00f3 diferen\u00e7as na qualidade da \u00e1gua, mas tamb\u00e9m nas propriedades \u00f3pticas, o \n\nque leva a afirma\u00e7\u00e3o de que um modelo \u00fanico baseado nos dois ambientes pode n\u00e3o ter um \n\nbom resultado quando se pretende utilizar uma abordagem emp\u00edrica. Um algoritmo quase-\n\nanal\u00edtico (QAA) parametrizado para as condi\u00e7\u00f5es de Nav (QAAOMR) apresentou resultados \n\nsignificativos com erros (erro m\u00e9dio percentual absoluto \u2013 MAPE) inferiores a 17% para o \n\ncoeficiente de absor\u00e7\u00e3o total (??), 19% para o coeficiente de absor\u00e7\u00e3o org\u00e2nico detrital (????) \ne 47% para o coeficiente de absor\u00e7\u00e3o do fitopl\u00e2ncton (??). O respectivo modelo foi utilizado \n\npara verificar seu desempenho em um ambiente eutrofizado como BB e a vers\u00e3o parametrizada \n\npor Watanabe et al. (2016) e denominada QAABBHR foi aplicada aos dados de Nav. Como \n\nresultado, observamos que as duas vers\u00f5es foram adequadas para estimar ?? com erros \ninferiores a 40%, no entanto, existe ainda a necessidade de melhorar as etapas para estimativa \n\nde ???? e ??. No caso de se aplicar um modelo emp\u00edrico de \u00fanica abordagem para estimar \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o de TSS para ambos os reservat\u00f3rios, observamos que essa abordagem n\u00e3o \n\napresentou resultados satisfat\u00f3rios, portanto, modelos espec\u00edficos baseados na banda do \n\nvermelho do MODIS foram utilizados para mapear TSS em cada um dos reservat\u00f3rios. Pode-\n\nse concluir ent\u00e3o, que o conhecimento acerca das propriedades \u00f3pticas da \u00e1gua se mostrou \n\ndeterminante para a modelagem bio-\u00f3ptica, principalmente no que diz respeito aos ambientes \n\naltamente contrastantes como BB e Nav. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: modelagem bio-\u00f3ptica, \u00e1guas interiores, sensoriamento remoto da \u00e1gua, \n\nsistema de reservat\u00f3rios em cascata \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\nThe objective of the present work was to perform a detailed survey of the bio-optical \n\ncharacteristics of the reservoirs of Barra Bonita (BB) and Nova Avanhandava (Nav) in order to \n\nevaluate the performance of a single approach aimed at estimating the inherent optical \n\nproperties (IOPs), as well as the concentration of total suspended solids (TSS). The research \n\nwas carried out using data collected in the field between 2014 and 2016, including the IOPs, \n\noptically significant components (OSCs) and remote sensing reflectance (???). The data \npresented from the OSCs confirmed that BB is more turbid than Nav because it presents higher \n\nphytoplankton production due to the input of high nutrient loads from the drainage basin. On \n\nthe other hand, Nav is more transparent with greater influence of inorganic matter, which favors \n\nthe appearance of submerged macrophytes. The concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in BB \n\nreached a maximum of 797.8 ?g l-1 in October/2014, while Nav presented a maximum of 38.6 \n\n?g l-1 in May/2016. The variability in the COS was highly related to the frequency of rainfall, \n\nin the year 2014, an extreme drought event occurred, altering the biogeochemical \n\ncharacteristics. BB reacted more abruptly than Nav because it presented an accumulation type \n\noperation system and because it is closer to the potentially polluting region. Nav presents a \n\nwater system in which there is no accumulation but constant flow of water. In addition, in the \n\noptical context, the absorption in Nav presented greater influence of the non-algal particulate \n\n(NAP) while in BB, the absorption was dominated by phytoplankton. Based on these results, it \n\ncan be concluded that the two environments present not only differences in water quality but \n\nalso in optical properties, which leads to the assertion that a single model based on the two \n\nenvironments may not have a good result when it is intended to use empirical approach. A \n\nquasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) parameterized for Nav conditions (QAAOMR) presented \n\nsignificant results with errors (mean absolute percentage error - MAPE) lower than 17% for the \n\ntotal absorption coefficient (??), 19% for the carbon detrital matter absorption coefficient \n(????) and 47% for the absorption coefficient of phytoplankton (??). The respective model \n\nwas used to verify its performance in a eutrophic environment such as BB and the version \n\nparameterized by Watanabe et al. (2016) and named QAABBHR was applied to the Nav data. \n\nThus, we note that the two versions were suitable for estimating ?? with errors (MAPE) less \nthan 40%, however, improvements must be carried out for estimating ???? and ??. In the case \n\nof applying a single empirical model to estimate TSS concentration for both reservoirs, we \n\nobserved that it did not present satisfactory results, so specific models based on the MODIS red \n\nband were used to map TSS in each of the reservoirs. It can be concluded, therefore, that \n\nknowledge about the optical properties of water has proved to be determinant for the bio-optical \n\nmodeling, especially with respect to highly contrasting environments such as BB and Nav. \n\n \n\nKeywords: bio-optical modeling, inland waters, remote sensing of water, reservoirs in cascade \n\nsystem \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nLIST OF FIGURES \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1.

On the one hand, the construction of \n\nthese reservoirs supports the agriculture and industrial development of the region; on the other \n\nhand, it generates a series of negative impacts including intensive deforestation, eutrophication \n\ndue to high loads of nutrients and suspended sediment from various activities, sedimentation \n\nand contamination of water bodies (BARBOSA et al. 1999). \n\nAccording to Frac\u00e1cio et al. (2002), all the reservoirs of the Tiet\u00ea River were classified \n\nas eutrophic for the parameter chlorophyll-a (Chl-a); for total phosphorus (TP), the reservoirs \n\nof Barra Bonita (BB), Bariri (B) and Ibitinga (Ib) were considered mesotrophic; and the \n\nPromiss\u00e3o (Pr) and Nova Avanhandava (Nav), oligotrophic. Differences in the mass of water \n\ncomposition between BB e Nav were reported and the first reservoir was attested to be more \n\npolluted than Nav. BB also has the highest concentration of suspended solids, thus higher \n\nturbidity when compared to Nav (CAVENAGHI et al. 2003). These results clearly show the \n\nexistence of a trophic gradient between the cascade reservoirs. \n\nAlthough some studies have shown that the cascade reservoirs have a trophic and \n\nspectral gradient (WACHHOLZ et al., 2009; PEREIRA FILHO et al. 2009), just recently \n\nstudies have investigated the cascade system effects on optical properties (ALC\u00c2NTARA et \n\nal., 2016, RODRIGUES et al., 2016a). In terms of water resource management, the traditional \n\nmethods for water monitoring are time consuming, expensive and demands in situ collection. \n\nBesides, these techniques present low spatial and temporal representativeness, therefore, the \n\noptical properties of the in-water constituents (Chl-a, non-algal-particle \u2013 NAP, total suspended \n\nsediment \u2013 TSS, colored dissolved organic matter \u2013 CDOM) and here known as optical \n\nsignificant components (OSCs), can be used in bio-optical models in order to estimate the \n\nconcentrations of the OSCs and support the water resource management considering large areas \n\nand short time mapping. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n20 \n\n1.2 Motivation \n\n \n\nEnvironments such as reservoirs designed in cascade system cause water quality \n\nmodifications from the upstream to downstream reducing the turbidity and increasing the \n\ntransparency of water (BARBOSA et al. 1999). The longitudinal variability is not the only \n\nfactor influencing the water quality dynamic, but the watershed controls several mechanisms \n\nof reservoirs functioning. Watersheds subjected to extensive use by human activities can \n\nproduce high loads of nutrients, suspended matter or even toxic substances to the reservoir \n\n(JORGENSEN et al., 2012). \n\nBuilt to attend single or more specific purpose, the reservoirs have multiple uses and \n\ntherefore, demands for complex strategies of management. The desired phases for management \n\nsystems include the integration of geographic information system and remote sensing in order \n\nto provide a rapid or a large-scale comprehension of reservoirs (TUNDISI and MATSUMURA-\n\nTUNDISI, 2011). Remote sensing is also important for offering spatial and temporal views of \n\nwater quality surface parameters, which is limited from in situ collections. Its applicability \n\nbecomes useful when the water degradation is caused by OSC, such as the green algae pigments \n\nas Chl-a, TSS, CDOM and NAP, thus producing detectable effects by optical remote sensing \n\ninstruments (GIARDINO et al., 2010). \n\nThe spectral region where these components can be detected is limited to a narrow range \n\nof optical wavelengths, in general, restricted between 400 to 850 nm (DEKKER, 1993). In \n\ninland waters, NAP and CDOM absorb at shorter wavelengths showing an exponential decay \n\ntoward longer wavelengths, while Chl-a presents absorption peaks in the blue and red \n\nwavelengths (ROESLER et al., 1989; BRICAUD et al., 1981). However, in waters with low \n\nphytoplankton concentration the absorption peak at the blue region is not detected (WU et al., \n\n2011), nevertheless, significant contributions of Chl-a lead to the enhancement of the \n\nabsorption peak at ~675 nm allowing its detection on the remote sensing reflectance (???) signal \n\nin very productive inland waters (DOXARAN et al., 2006).  \n\nWaters dominated by sediment, especially NAP and pure water showed satisfactory \n\nresults with the empirical relationships ???(850)/???(550) and ???(850)/???(650) for TSS \n\nretrieval in Gironde estuary (DOXARAN et al., 2006). In waters comprised by mineral \n\nsuspended sediment (MSS), the red-to-green ratio showed to be applicable, however, with \n\nincreasing influence of phytoplankton and CDOM this relationship was found to break down, \n\nassuming the limited potential of the model (BINDING et al., 2003). In the case of CDOM \n\nabsorption estimation, D\u2019Sa and Miller (2003) showed that the ratio between two visible bands \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n21 \n\n???(510)/???(555) was suitable for the turbid waters of Mississippi River, while Doxaran et \n\nal. (2006) found the ratio ???(400)/???(700) more appropriate for Tamar estuary. For Chl-a \n\nretrieval, Dall\u2019Olmo et al. (2003, 2005) showed that a three-band model based on NIR-Red \n\nwavelengths produce more accurate values in turbid waters, however, they also noticed that \n\nboth Chl-a fluorescence and Chl-a mass-specific absorption coefficient (?????\n? ) variability can \n\nintroduce more uncertainties in the estimative. \n\nIn other words, the knowledge about the optical water properties can improve the \n\nformulation of models for OSC concentration retrieval, however, algorithms based on empirical \n\nassumptions often fail when applied to other study sites (RITCHIE et al., 2003). Besides, these \n\nmodels are also limited for a specific range of OSC concentration. Kumar et al. (2016) for \n\nexample, found a simple correlation between MODIS ???(645 ??) and TSS concentration in \n\nChilika Lagoon, India. Their model showed to be limited to the range between 6.5 and 200 mg \n\nl-1, with increasing error in very low TSS (&lt;6.54 mg l-1). Ogashawara et al. (2013) evaluated \n\nthe influence of Chl-a absorption on the performance of several empirical algorithms using data \n\nfrom environments with very low and very high cyanobacteria. As result, they verified a \n\ndecrease of model\u2019s sensitivity in high phycocyanin concentration environments. Chen et al. \n\n(2015) studied a wide range of TSS (58 \u2013 577.2 mg l-1) in estuary and coastal waters using an \n\nimproved model based on the log-ratio (???(???)/???(???)), however, they had to consider \n\na constraint based on TSS concentration below and above 31 mg l-1. \n\nIn general, the empirical methods work well for turbid inland waters, however, in \n\noligotrophic environments the performance decrease considerably using the same band \n\ncombination. Gons et al. (2008) for example, showed that a red-to-NIR band Ch-a algorithm \n\nproved to be applicable for eutrophic to hypereutrophic waters, however the accuracy dropped \n\nconsiderably for oligotrophic waters. They also reported that remote sensing of Chl-a is limited \n\nin low concentration range and not the contrary. The alternative for low concentrations would \n\nbe to use the blue-to-green band ratio (GONS and AUER, 2004; GONS et al., 2008).  \n\nAiming to address the empirical issue, semi-analytical approaches use the IOP and \n\napparent optical properties (AOP) to model the reflectance and vice versa. These properties are \n\nthen used in analytical methods to retrieve the water constituents. The main limitation regards \n\nthe insufficient knowledge about the IOPs used in the equations (MOREL and GORDON, 1980; \n\nDEKKER, 1993). The example of a more robust model is the quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) \n\ndeveloped to derive the absorption and backscattering coefficients in open ocean and coastal \n\nwaters (LEE et al., 2002). After that, several initiatives were carried out aiming to fit this model \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n22 \n\nto productive inland waters (LE et al., 2009a; YANG et al., 2013, MISHRA et al., 2014; \n\nWATANABE et al., 2016a). A version based on CDOM dominated waters was also developed \n\n(OGASHAWARA et al., 2016), however, a model adapted to inorganic matter dominated water \n\nwas not addresses yet. A semi-analytical algorithm using the QAA was successfully applied for \n\nretrieving the water clarity based on new theoretical model to interpret the Secchi disk depth, \n\n???  (LEE et al., 2015). For validation, the authors used data covering oceanic, coastal and \n\ninland waters (lake) and as result they got an average absolute difference of ~18%, highlighting \n\nthe accomplishment of a model using a wide range of data. \n\nAs previously mentioned, the comprehension about the bio-optical properties of \n\ndifferent environments helps to indicate the suitable approach for water quality parameters \n\nestimation. Many efforts have shown the success of empirical approaches in deriving the water \n\noptical properties in very turbid inland waters, however, when data from two widely trophic \n\nstate (oligo to eutrophic) reservoirs is supposed to be mixed, we expect the models to perform \n\npoorly, indicating the limitation of a single approach in retrieving the OSCs. Up to now, \n\nincipient initiatives showed the influence of cascade system in the optical properties, which \n\nmeans that a lot of efforts still need to be done. \n\n \n\n1.3 Hypothesis \n\n \n\nIn a cascading arrangement where the water flows with different composition through \n\nthe system, the bio-optical modeling can be challenging. As we learned from the literature such \n\nsystems range from hyper-to-oligotrophic, from organic-to-inorganic dominated waters, and \n\nconsequently the development of an algorithm to map the water optical properties needs to deal \n\nwith such contrast. Moreover, the literature showed that empirical models are constrained by \n\nthe local optical properties and the range of OSC concentration, while semi-analytical \n\napproaches tend to fail where the phytoplankton is not the dominant component and where \n\nsome empirical steps are calibrated using synthetic data. Thus, our hypothesis bases on the fact \n\nthat due to the organic and inorganic nature of both BB and Nav reservoirs, the empirical \n\napproach won\u2019t be able to map the OSC accurately using a single model, however, recalibrating \n\nthe empirical steps using in situ data, the quasi-analytical algorithm will increase the retrieval \n\nof water optical properties and therefore will be able to map operationally the water quality \n\nfrom remotely sensed images in a cascade system. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n23 \n\n1.4 Objectives \n\n \n\nAccording to the thesis hypothesis, we aimed to investigate the water optical properties \n\nof both BB and Nav in order to evaluate the performance of a single model built for retrieving \n\nthe inherent optical properties as well as total suspended sediment concentration of both \n\nreservoirs. For this, specific objectives were designed: \n\n \n\n- Characterize the absorption properties in both BB and Nav reservoirs; \n\n- Re-parameterize the QAA algorithm based on OLCI/Sentinel-3 bands using in situ data \n\nfrom Nav; validate the algorithm using an independent dataset collected from the same \n\narea in a different season; \n\n- Assess the performance of a single QAA version (QAABBHR from Watanabe et al. 2016 \n\nand QAAOMR proposed here) highlighting the improvements and fragilities from each \n\nversion supposing to choose a single approach for mapping the absorption properties in \n\nthe entire cascade; \n\n- Assess the performance of empirical models for retrieving TSS concentration in both \n\nBB and Nav using single or separate models. \n\n \n\n1.5 Outline of the Thesis \n\n \n\nThis thesis is organized in 7 chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the theme, highlighting the \n\nproblem of the research followed by the questions we intend to answer and the objectives we \n\nexpect to achieve. Chapter 2 describes the study areas focusing on their physical and \n\nenvironmental characteristics; description of the method designed to sampling definition and \n\nthe field trips. Chapter 3 describes the IOPs of both reservoirs and their relationships with \n\noptical water parameters. In Chapter 4, a parametrization of QAAOMR was carried out using \n\ndata from Nav and validate it with an independent dataset collected in a different season. \n\nChapter 5 compares and evaluates the performance of both QAAOMR and QAABBHR in retrieving \n\nthe IOPs using data from BB and Nav, respectively. In Chapter 6 empirical models were \n\nformulated aiming to retrieve TSS in both reservoirs. Lastly, Chapter 7 pointed out the main \n\nfindings of the research and it makes some recommendations for future works. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n24 \n\nCHAPTER 2: STUDY AREA AND FIELD CAMPAIGNS \n\n \n\n2.1 General characteristics \n\n \n\nThe reservoirs of Barra Bonita (BB) and Nova Avanhandava (Nav) (Figure 2.1) are \n\nsituated in the middle and lower portion of the Tiet\u00ea River, S\u00e3o Paulo State, respectively. BB \n\n(22\u00b031?10?S, 48\u00b032?3?W) is a storage system and began its operation in 1963 flooding an area \n\nof 310 km2, with a dam length of 480 m, 90.3 days of residence time, being formed from the \n\ndamming of Tiet\u00ea and Piracicaba Rivers. The regional climate transits between tropical and \n\nsubtropical, and the annual seasons are not well marked. According to the Koppen \n\nclassification, the climate is mesothermal type - CWA, with a dry winter and a hot summer \n\n(PRADO, 2004). Pastures and sugar cane monoculture predominantly comprised the land \n\ncover. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n25 \n\nFigure 2.1. Graphic representation of the study area emphasizing (a) Brazil\u2019s territory, (b) Tiet\u00ea \n\nRiver located at S\u00e3o Paulo State and the location of the reservoirs from upstream to \n\ndownstream: Barra Bonita, Bariri, Ibitinga, Promiss\u00e3o, Nova Avanhandava and Tr\u00eas Irm\u00e3os, \n\n(c) sampling location of Nav and (d) BB. \n\n \n\n \n\nOn the other hand, Nav (21\u00b07?1?S, 50\u00b012?6?W) is a run-of-river reservoir and was \n\ncreated in 1982, flooding an area of 210 km\u00b2 (at its maximum quota), with a dam length of \n\n2,038 m and mean residence time of the water around 46 days (TORLONI, et al., 1993). The \n\nreservoir is part of a region whose influence of Continental Tropical and Polar Antarctic air \n\nmasses are marked. The first mass is hot and dry and occurs mainly in the summer (24 and 30\u00b0 \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n26 \n\nC), while the second is cold and damp, and, despite being-active all year, its occurrence is more \n\nintense in winter, causing a decrease of temperature (22 to 14\u00b0 C) (CBH-BT, 1999).  \n\nBB reservoir is an ecosystem characterized as polymictic and eutrophic, with high loads \n\nof nutrients, whose contribution leads to the development of blooms of cyanobacteria during \n\nthe summer, and Bacillariophyceae during the winter (DELLAMANO-OLIVEIRA et al. 2007). \n\nThe Piracicaba and Tiet\u00ea Rivers, which along their courses are subject to the carrying of organic \n\nand inorganic origin waste, arising from agricultural, urban and industrial activities, affecting \n\nwater quality. Nav is an oligo-to-mesotrophic reservoir with the upper layer of the water column \n\nwell oxygenated and pH ranging from slightly acid to alkaline (6.47 \u2013 8.2), conductivity \n\nrelatively high (83 \u2013 150 \u00b5S cm-1) and low concentrations of nutrients (Total N: 0.05 \u2013 0.23 \u00b5g \n\nl-1 and Total P: 18.02 \u2013 32.33 \u00b5g l-1) (RODGHER et al. 2005; SMITH et al. 2014). The high \n\ntransparency of the water often leads to the growth of submerged macrophytes (e.g. Egeria sp. \n\n\u2013 Elodea) (SMITH et al. 2014), although, during sample collections we avoided those areas. \n\nThe catchment basin surrounding the reservoir receives input from non-point source of \n\npollution such as sugar cane and citric plantation (orange and lemon) and cattle breeding. \n\nThere is evidence that the downstream reservoirs of Tiet\u00ea River have improved water \n\nquality to those further upstream providing an enhancement of chemical constitution of water \n\nlimiting the development of floating vegetation representative of a eutrophic environment \n\n(BARBOSA et al., 1999; CAVENAGHI et al. 2003). The cascade system generates significant \n\nmodifications along the river changing aspects such as heterogeneity, connectivity and the \n\ncoarse / fine particulate organic material. Moreover, this type of system influences the water \n\nquality, the composition and structure of phytoplankton community, and increases the \n\neutrophication process in the upstream reservoirs (BARBOSA et al., 1999). \n\n \n\n2.2 Strategy for sampling design \n\n \n\nBased on the sampling design, a random stratified sampling method was used to \n\ndetermine the location for collecting water and optical data in BB and Nav (RODRIGUES et \n\nal., 2016b). Therefore, statistical and computational procedures were established aiming to \n\nprovide parameters that subsidize the sampling design definition (Figure 2.2). For this purpose, \n\nthe Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Landsat-8 imagery referring to an annual cycle was \n\nacquired at the USGS \u2013 U.S. Geological Survey website&lt;http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/> and \n\nthe criterion of less cloud cover and absence of glint effect, visually detected, was applied.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n27 \n\nThe images hosted at the USGS website are geometrically corrected and available for \n\nusers in the orthorectified level (L1T) in which the reference data are terrain control points and \n\naltitude based on digital elevation model (DEM), such as the SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography \n\nMission) (USGS, 2014). This procedure assures the overlapping between images with \n\ngeometric error below one pixel providing the high matching considering different periods. The \n\nmethodological approach is displayed in Figure 2.2. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2. Flowchart showing the methodological scheme for sampling stations definition. \n\n???? represents the value of reflectance at the top of atmosphere (TOA), SD stands for the \nstandard deviation, NDWI is the Normalized Difference Water Index, and PCA is the Principal \n\nComponent Analysis. The box 1 refers to the multispectral images; box 2 stands for the \n\nreservoir\u2019s delimitation and box 3, stratified sampling. \n\n \n\n \n\nA set of images available for a year was radiometrically calibrated. In this process, the \n\ndigital numbers (DN) of each pixel are rescaled for radiance or reflectance at the top of the \n\natmosphere (TOA), ????, using gain and offset parameters provided by the metadata of the \n\nimage (USGS, 2013). This procedure removes the effects caused by the difference of \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n28 \n\nillumination geometry (COLLETT et al., 1998). Studies carried out in aquatic systems showed \n\nthat TOA products yielded similar or better results from those atmospherically corrected data \n\n(OLMANSON et al., 2011, KUTSER, 2012).  \n\nIn view of the hydrological dynamics and other anthropic or natural interventions that \n\nthe reservoirs undergo over time, it is important to consider the variations in the chemical and \n\nbiological characteristics of the water body, with the input of nutrients from agricultural \n\nactivities around the reservoir, and still insertion of organic and inorganic substances carried \n\nlongitudinally along the entire cascade system. Therefore, two statistical metrics were \n\nconsidered to analyze the variations: mean and standard deviation (SD). After the radiometric \n\ncorrection process, a set of images referring to one year (2013 - 2014), each consisting of 6 \n\nspectral bands (bands 2 to 7), were submitted to the calculation of the mean and subsequent \n\nstandard deviation. Bands corresponding to the same wavelength were compressed and then the \n\nmean and standard deviation for the studied months were calculated, with each pixel of the final \n\nimage having the mean value of spectral ????, as well as standard deviation.  \n\nFor delimitation of the boundary of each reservoir a set of processes were established, \n\nsuch as the selection of a reference image, application of the NDWI, slice, conversion raster-\n\nvector e finally, the creation of the mask. The image of reference was based on the season with \n\nlow rainfall. In this case, the image from July/2013 was chosen. It is worth mentioning that Nav \n\ndoes not present a notable variation in water level due to its operational system, on the contrary, \n\nBB varies seasonally. Aiming to separate water from other targets, NDWI from McFeeters \n\n(1996) was applied as follows: \n\n \n\n???? =\n????? ? ???\n\n????? + ???\n (2.1) \n\n \n\nwhere Green and NIR are the bands 3 and 5 from OLI/Landsat-8, respectively. This ratio aims \n\nto maximize the water reflectance in the visible spectral region and minimize it in the infrared.  \n\nThere are modifications of this index, such as the MNDWI proposed by Xu (2006) who \n\nused a ratio between the green and middle infrared (MIR) bands aiming to enhanced the features \n\nof water in regions which the contamination by other targets are evident like noises related to \n\nbuilt-up land, soil and vegetation overestimating the water targets. However, we kept the \n\nEquation 2.1, since the method employed here predicts the use of a buffer in order to avoid the \n\nborders with other targets but water. The separation of water from the other targets was obtained \n\nby slicing between values representative of each target. Thus, pixels with values assigned with \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n29 \n\nwater were allocated in a class while the others in another class, resulting in two classes: water \n\nand non-water.  \n\nFor stratified sampling, the SD images were transformed in Principal Component \n\nAnalysis (PCA) in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment and then sliced \n\naccording to intervals empirically defined. The selected image for this step was based on the \n\ncomponent with higher variability from the set of 6 SD bands. The slice step allowed the \n\ncreation of stratus for further sampling points definition. A buffer with 70 m was created for \n\neach reservoir to prevent the edges formed by land. Using the tool Hawth\u2019s Tools developed by \n\nHawthorne Beyer (http://www.spatialecology.com/) and compatible to a GIS environment, the \n\nrandom stratified sampling was possible to be carried out. Initially, more than a required number \n\nof samples were created in order to remove the non-spatialized stations. The minimal distance \n\nof 1 km between samples was established to prevent clusters. As result, 20 samples were \n\nacquired for each field campaign except for the third campaign in BB that included 4 samples \n\n(totalizing 24 samples) and in Nav 20 samples in different locations were added for the first and \n\nsecond field trips and 19 for the third field trip. \n\n \n\n2.3 Field campaigns \n\n \n\nThe water quality parameters, as well as their spatial distribution are seasonal \n\ndependent, therefore, we considered at least two periods of the year for water and optical data \n\ncollection. The water samples were collected in six field campaigns (Figure 1). For Nav, the \n\nfield trips occurred during austral autumn (Nav1: 28 April \u2013 2 May/2014 and Nav2: 23 \u2013 26 \n\nSeptember/2014) and austral spring (Nav3: 9 and 14 May/2016). For BB, the field trips were \n\ncarried out in austral autumn (BB1: 5 \u2013 9 May/2014) and austral spring (BB2: 13 \u2013 16 \n\nOctober/2014 and BB3: 13 \u2013 15 September/2015). Both seasons are known for intermediate \n\nprecipitation amounts between summer (wet period) and winter (dry period). Data collections \n\nwere avoided in the summer due to high rainfall rates making difficult to obtain cloud free \n\nsatellite images. \n\nAs depicted in Figure 2.3, the rainfall data in BB and Nav showed distinct values. In \n\nNav, for example, the month of January and February from 2011 to 2016 showed the highest \n\naverages values of 197.24 and 196.92 mm, respectively. BB, in turn, presented 222.59 and \n\n209.16 mm in January and February, respectively. These values were expected because they \n\noccurred in the wet period (summer). The year of 2014 showed the lowest values for the \n\nrespective months presenting 130.75 and 141.81 mm in Nav and 168.51 and 146.24 mm in BB, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n30 \n\nrespectively. The lowest average values were observed in July and August corresponding to the \n\ndry period (winter). Nav showed in July and August averages of 42.51 and 12.79 mm, \n\nrespectively, whilst BB presented averages of 72.85 and 46.29 mm. In 2014, the lowest rainfall \n\nin Nav were observed in June (24.00 mm) and August (6.80 mm) while in BB, the lowest ones \n\nwere seen in July (40.26 mm) and August (38.83 mm). The months chosen for the field works \n\nvaried below and above the mean measures (2011 \u2013 2016), but in the austral summer of \n\n2013/2014, the values were below the average and this happened due to an extreme event of \n\ndrought classified as exceptionally dry (COELHO et al., 2015). The authors also described the \n\n2014/2015 summer as atypical and dry, however, in lower magnitude as the 2013/2014 summer. \n\nThe months of April/May of 2014 represented the period of the first data collection in \n\nNav and the rainfall data showed that in both months the values (98.41 and 69.00 mm, \n\nrespectively) were below the average between 2011 and 2016 (99.67 and 95.05 mm). The \n\nmonth of September/2014 related to the second field collection presented value (141.40 mm) \n\nabove the average (86.14 mm) and the same happened to the third field trip (May/2016) which \n\nshowed a value of 197.49 mm above the average (95.05 mm). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3.

The second field trip that occurred in October/2014, also exhibited a \n\nvalue (56.19 mm) below the average (164.14 mm). On the other hand, the third field trip \n\n(September/2015) displayed a value (192.08 mm) above the average (101.35 mm).

A slight \n\nvariability between 2011 to 2016 was observed in Nav (Figure 2.4), with an average interval of \n\n357.60 \u00b1 0.30 to 357.77 \u00b1 0.32 m from January to December. The year of 2014 displayed the \n\nlowest water level except in January that showed a value of 357.56 m. The water level fluctuated \n\nbetween 0.13 m in 2011 to 0.69 m in 2015, in 2014 the amplitude was 0.50 m. Nav is a run-of-\n\nriver reservoir, therefore, the water level variation with low amplitude is expected (PERBICHE-\n\nNEVES et al., 2013). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.4.

The year of 2014 was also the one with water level \n\nexcepted for the months of January and February that was lower in 2015. The amplitude ranged \n\nbetween 2.11 m in 2013 to 9.84 m in 2015. 2014 presented an amplitude of 3.85 along the year. \n\nThe storage or accumulation reservoir of BB generates a higher variation in water level than \n\nthe run-of-river system (PERBICHE-NEVES et al., 2013). \n\nThe water flow (Figure 2.5) also showed to vary as a function of the dry event in 2014, \n\nshowing the lowest values in almost the entire year, except for January of 2015. Regarding the \n\nmagnitude, Nav and BB presented significant differences, the variability in Nav, for instance, \n\nranged from 232.09 m3/s in October to 683.34 m3/s in December, while in BB, the range was \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n32 \n\nbetween 113.00 m3/s in October and 361.50 m3/s in December. The water flow was \n\nconsiderably reduced in BB aiming to keep the water retained in the system during the dry \n\nevents, on the other hand, in Nav, the regulation of water flow, theoretically, is not necessary \n\ndue to the absence of storage area, so the water flows naturally according to the river regime \n\n(EGR\u00c9 and MILEWSKI, 2002). In addition, the regulation of Nav showed to be influenced by \n\nBB because of the variation in phase observed at Figure 2.5, highlighting the co-oscillation \n\nbetween them. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5.

The amount of water collected for BB and Nav was established according to the total \n\nparticulate matter capable to be filter without saturate it. Therefore, a total of 5L of water was \n\ncollected for both reservoirs, however, for each TSS and Chl-a concentrations 250 \u2013 500 mL \n\nwere filtered considering one filter/replica in BB and 750 \u2013 1000 mL were used for Nav. The \n\nwater samples were stored in polyethylene containers and refrigerated for laboratory analysis. \n\nWater transparency was measured by a Secchi disk (30 cm diameter), turbidity by a portable \n\nturbidimeter, model Hanna HI 93414, and dissolved oxygen by a portable meter, model Hanna \n\nHI 9146-04. \n\nThe in situ spectroradiometric measurements are very important for bio-optical \n\ncharacterization and information extraction from remote sensing data, as they act as a bridge \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n33 \n\nbetween optical measurements in laboratory and measures taken at the orbital or airborne level. \n\nThis kind of measure permits the elimination of some undesirable effects such as atmospheric \n\ninfluence and the scale effect. Thus, radiometric measurements were carried out through \n\nRAMSES-ARC (radiance sensors) and RAMSES-ACC (irradiance sensors) \n\nspectroradiometers. The RAMSES instruments provide simultaneous measurements of \n\nupwelling (??) and downwelling (??) irradiance and upwelling radiance (??) of the water \n\ncolumn as well as measurements of downwelling irradiance incident onto the water surface \n\n(??(0+)), incident sky radiance (????) and total upwelling radiance (??) above the surface of the \n\nwater. \n\nThe determination of the total particulate absorption coefficient (ap = NAP + \n\nphytoplankton) was accomplished by the use of an integrating sphere module present in the \n\ndouble-beam Shimadzu UV-2600 UV-Vis spectrophotometer, with spectral sampling from 280 \n\nnm to 800 nm and spectral sampling of 1 nm. The pure water absorption coefficient is a constant \n\nobtained by Pope and Fry (1997). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n34 \n\nCHAPTER 3: ABSORPTION PROPERTIES OF TWO OPTICALLY DIFFERENT \n\nRESERVOIRS SITUATED ALONG THE CASCADE SYSTEM OF TIET\u00ca RIVER \n\n \n\n3.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nOptical properties of water are the basis of watercolor retrieval algorithms. Variations \n\nof these properties can change the model parameters, optimal spectral bands and the accuracy \n\nof retrieval algorithms. In order to improve the performance of bio-optical models (semi-\n\nanalytical approaches), a better understanding about the variability in the absorption (a, units \n\nin m-1) and backscattering (bb, units in m\n-1) coefficients is crucial. These coefficients influence \n\nthe magnitude and the spectral distribution of the water-leaving reflectance. \n\nThe a(?) denotes the contribution of all components present in the aquatic system and \n\nis commonly represented into four additive elements, including the pure water (??), NAP \n\n(????), CDOM (?????) and phytoplankton (??), all dependent on wavelength (BABIN et al., \n\n2003; BINDING et al., 2008). In case of pure water, the absorption starts to increase from green \n\nto near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths (SMITH and BAKER, 1981). CDOM can remove the blue \n\nlight in the first layer of the water and exhibit an exponential decrease with increasing \n\nwavelength; however, the shape is not equal for all waters (DEKKER, 1993). In order to \n\ndescribe the spectral CDOM absorption, Bricaud et al. (1981) came up with the following \n\nmodel: \n\n \n\n?????(?) = ????? (?0)?\n??????(???0) (3.1) \n\n \n\nwhere ?0 is a reference wavelength, ?????(?0) is the absorption estimate at a reference \n\nwavelength, and ????? is the spectral slope of the ?????(?). The former provides insights \n\nabout the characteristics of CDOM in terms of chemistry, source and diagenesis (HELMS et \n\nal., 2008) and is also a proxy for CDOM composition such as the ratio of fulvic to humic acids \n\nand molecular weight (SHANMUGAM et al., 2011). Besides, it is strongly dependent on the \n\nwavelength interval chosen for analysis (ROESLER et al., 1989; LOISELLE et al., 2009). The \n\nNAP also presents an exponential decrease from short to longer wavelengths and is represented \n\nby the spectral slope, ????, which is related to the fraction of organic and inorganic matter \n\n(BABIN et al., 2003). Meanwhile, phytoplankton presents two distinct absorption features at \n\n443 and 675 nm. Its composition is clearly defined by the water quality and its abundance is \n\nessentially determined by the underwater light and nutrient loading (DEKKER, 1993). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n35 \n\nThe characterization of IOP in ocean and coastal waters have been massively studied in \n\nthe last four decades, therefore, the comprehension about the relationship between in-water \n\nconstituents and optical properties are well known (MOREL and MARITORENA, 2001; \n\nBABIN et al., 2003). In open ocean, for example, the influence of terrigenous matter is \n\nnegligible and is assumed that only phytoplankton domain the optical properties as well as the \n\npure water (MOREL and BRICAUD, 1986). In contrast, the inland waters are considered \n\ncomplex environments due to the increased number of color-producing agents and the high \n\nvariability in their concentrations, limiting the use of empirical oceanic algorithms for Chl-a \n\nretrieval, for example (BUKATA, 2005). More robust models such as the semi-analytical and \n\nanalytical approaches require the knowledge about the mass-specific inherent optical properties \n\n(SIOPs), like those used by Lee et al. (2002) with the QAA and the Garver-Siegel-Maritorena \n\nalgorithm (GARVER and SIEGEL, 1997; MARITORENA et al., 2002). The SIOPs are \n\nretrieved by normalizing the absorption coefficient of a certain OSC and the respective \n\nconcentration. The mass-specific phytoplankton absorption (??\n?\n\n), for example, is related to \n\nphytoplankton cell size, accessory pigments and package effect (BRICAUD et al., 1995; \n\nBABIN et al., 2003).  \n\nRegisters of the (S)IOPs in inland waters are available for specific regions around the \n\nworld such as in Babin et al. (2003) who studied the coastal waters around Europe; Binding et \n\nal. (2008) produced a data set of absorption coefficients in Lake Erie; Perkins et al. (2009) \n\ndocumented the spectral features, magnitudes and variability of the IOPs in Finger Lakes of \n\nNew York; Le et al. (2009b) investigated the variations of absorption and total specific \n\nabsorption coefficient of phytoplankton in Lake Taihu, China; Campbell et al. (2011) described \n\nthe SIOPs of three sub-tropical and tropical waters reservoirs in Australia; Wu et al. (2011) \n\nestimated the absorption and backscattering coefficients in Poyang Lake, China and analyzed \n\ntheir relations to the main water constituents; Matthews and Bernard (2013) presented the \n\nabsorption properties of phytoplankton, CDOM and NAP for three small optically-diverse \n\nSouth African inland waters; Yl\u00f6stalo et al. (2014) characterized variations of different \n\nabsorption components between different lake types and seasons in various lakes in the boreal \n\nregion, in turn, Riddick et al. (2015) showed the spatial variability of absorption coefficients \n\nover a biogeochemical gradient in Lake Balaton, Hungary. \n\nMany efforts have been done from the last decade regarding the studies of (S)IOPs in \n\ninland waters, however, much more is expected to be done in order to cover a variety of \n\nenvironments and provide subsides to understand how these properties influence the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n36 \n\nparameterization of bio-optical models aiming to assist the remote-sensed-based monitoring of \n\nwater quality. Environments such as reservoirs designed in a cascade system, for example, \n\ncauses limnological modifications from the upstream to downstream reducing the turbidity and \n\nincreasing water clarity (BARBOSA et al., 1999). The (S)IOPs can be somehow modulated by \n\nbiogeochemical filtration from the first to the last reservoirs. The current study aims to \n\ncharacterize two optically different reservoirs situated along the cascade system of Tiet\u00ea River, \n\nwhose influence are dictated by the watershed dynamic, in order to improve the knowledge \n\nabout bio-optical properties of a system covering two distinct trophic states (oligo to \n\nhypereutrophic) and to raise the main sources of spatial variability in the IOPs. \n\n \n\n3.2 Data and Methods \n\n \n\nFor this study, data from all the field trips were used. The campaigns of BB were named \n\nas BB1, BB2 and BB3 standing for the sequence of field campaigns realization. For Nav, the \n\ncampaigns were identified as Nav1, Nav2 and Nav3. The number of samples used for this \n\nchapter is displayed in Table 3.1. \n\n \n\n3.2.1 Water quality parameters \n\n \n\nTo determine the TSS concentration we applied the method described by APHA (1998). \n\nThe water volume was filtered on the same day of collection through pre-ashed and pre-weighed \n\nWhatmam fiberglass GF/F filter with a nominal porosity of 0.7 ?m and then stored at the \n\nrefrigerator until analysis. The filters were dried in 100\u00b0 C oven for 12h, and then weighted in \n\nan analytical balance. To retrieve the inorganic suspended sediment (ISS), the filter dried and \n\nweighed in the last step was subjected to a muffle furnace for 75 min at 550\u00b0 C and weighted \n\nagain. As result, we determined the TSS, ISS and to estimate the organic suspended sediment \n\n(OSS), the last weighted filter was subtracted to the original filter weight after first drying. \n\nThe analysis to determine the Chl-a concentration was based on Golterman et al. (1978). \n\nThe specified volume of water was filtered under low vacuum pressure through a Whatman \n\nfiberglass GF/F filter with a porosity of 0.7 ?m, and then frozen for laboratory analysis for no \n\nlonger than 1 week. The chlorophyll was extracted by maceration in 90% acetone, then stored \n\nin 20 mL tubes and centrifuged. Afterward, one sample was placed in 1 cm quartz cuvette and \n\nto represent the reference a volume of acetone was placed in another cuvette. The readings were \n\nmade in a spectrophotometer at 663 nm indicating the maximum absorption of chlorophyll in \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n37 \n\nacetone and at 750 nm characterizing the absorption by chlorophyll and pheophytin. After this \n\nreading, 0.1N hydrochloric acid was added to the sample in order to remove magnesium from \n\nthe chlorophyll and convert it into pheophytin and another reading was taken. \n\n \n\n3.2.2 Inherent optical properties \n\n \n\nTo estimate the CDOM absorption coefficient, ?????(?), a volume of water was \n\nfiltered through a fiberglass Whatman GF/F with porosity of 0.7 ?m, and then re-filtered under \n\nlow vacuum pressure using a nylon membrane filter with porosity of 0.2 ?m. The readings were \n\nperformed using Shimadzu UV-2600 UV-VIS spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU, Japan) in \n\nabsorbance mode, and the samples were placed in 10 cm quartz cuvettes. For each set of \n\nmeasurements, we performed a reference reading containing Milli-Q water, and for each read \n\nsample (???????? ), the reference absorbance value was subtracted (?????). The measured \n\noptical densities (???????? ) were converted to absorption coefficient by multiplying by 2.303 \n\nand dividing by the path length (l = 0.1 m for a 10 cm cuvette). Therefore, the ?????(?) was \n\nestimated following the equation (TILSTONE et al., 2002): \n\n \n\n?????(?) = 2.303\n????????\n\n?\n= 2.303\n\n????????\n\n0.1\n     (??1) (3.2) \n\n \n\nThe ?????(?) follows an exponential function decreasing from the visible to longer \n\nwavelengths. The data adopted to fit to the nonlinear regression ranged from 350 and 500 nm \n\n(BABIN et al., 2003). Twardowski et al. (2004) highlighted the main issues related to the \n\nspectral variability found in the results of many studies and attribute to the spectral range used \n\nin the adjustment. The ????? can be used to understand the composition of CDOM (GREEN \n\nand BLOUGH, 1994, TWARDOWSKI et al., 2004). Absorption measures may contain errors \n\nrelated to the scattering of small particles or colloids that can cross the filters, leading some \n\nresearchers to use equations to correct these effects (BRICAUD et al., 1981, GREEN and \n\nBLOUGH, 1994, BABIN et al., 2003). In order to turn the results comparable, the procedure \n\ndescribed by Babin et al. (2003) were adopted in this study. \n\nFor particulate absorption coefficients, water samples were filtered at low vacuum \n\npressure using a 47 mm diameter fiberglass Whatman GF/F filter. The filters were wrapped in \n\naluminum foil and frozen until laboratory analysis. A white filter wetted with ultrapure water \n\nwas used as reference and the filter containing the particulate was placed on the integrating \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n38 \n\nsphere module presented in the double-beam Shimadzu UV-2600 UV-VIS spectrophotometer \n\n(SHIMADZU, Japan) with spectral sampling ranging from 280 \u2013 800 nm, to measure their \n\noptical density (OD). The T-R (Transmittance-Reflectance) method described by Tassan and \n\nFerrari (1995, 1998) was employed to derive the total particulate absorption coefficient (??). \n\nThe particulate filter was submitted to depigmentation by oxidation in 10% sodium \n\nhypochlorite (NaClO), ensuring free phytoplankton influence to obtain ????. The ?? was \n\nretrieved by subtracting the ???? from the ??. \n\n \n\n?? (?) = ??(?) ? ???? (?) (3.3) \n\n \n\nThe ??\n? (?) was obtained by normalizing the absorption due to phytoplankton by the \n\nChl-a concentration. Babin et al. (2003) highlight that ?? includes absorption related to all \n\npigments, incorporating phaeopigment associated with other particles other than living \n\nphytoplankton. The ???? can be adjusted by Roesler et al. (1989): \n\n \n\n???? (?) = ???? (?0)?\n??(???0) (3.4) \n\n \n\nThe fit of the model was carried out between 350 and 800 nm, excluding the interval \n\nbetween 400 \u2013 480 and 620 \u2013 710 nm related to the absorption of some type of pigment interval \n\nthat may have remained after depigmentation (BABIN et al., 2003). \n\n \n\n3.3 Results \n\n \n\n3.3.1 General characteristics of water quality parameters and optical properties \n\n \n\nThe water quality parameters as well as the optical properties were all analyzed in terms \n\nof field trips (Table 3.1). Thus, the average turbidity between BB1 and BB2 was statistically \n\ndifferent (p-value &lt;0.05) and the same happened between BB2 and BB3. On the other hand, \n\ndata from BB1 and BB3 were not statistically different (p-value > 0.05). The same result was \n\nalso observed for Chl-a and TSS concentrations. The increase of Chl-a concentration in October \n\nof 2014 was due to the drought effect leading to flow reduction and longer retention time \n\n(WATANABE et al., 2016b). High values of Chl-a for BB revealed the eutrophication status \n\nof the water, mainly in the winter (LUZIA, 2004). In Nav, the average turbidity from Nav1 and \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n39 \n\nNav2 was not considered statistically different (p-value > 0.05), however, the average Chl-a \n\nconcentration from all three field trips was statistically different. The average TSS from Nav1 \n\nand Nav2 was not different, but this was not true when data from Nav2 was compared to Nav3 \n\nand Nav1 with Nav3. Assessing both reservoirs, we clearly observe that BB is more turbid due \n\nto high contribution of phytoplankton mainly in the BB2 that achieved a Chl-a value of 797.80 \n\n?g l-1 close to the dam. On the contrary, Nav presented low concentrations of Chl-a, where the \n\naverage did not exceed 9.0 ?g l-1 for Nav1 and Nav2 but reached 26.4 ?g l-1 in Nav3, where the \n\nsamples were concentrated at the upstream region of the reservoir. The variation of water \n\nquality parameters was strictly related to rainfall condition as well as the location of each \n\nreservoir in the cascade system. The analysis of individual reservoirs cannot provide the \n\nnecessary information about the water quality dynamic, because this kind of structure cause \n\ndiscontinuity in the physical and biological features (BARBOSA et al., 1999). \n\n \n\nTable 3.1.

No \n\nsignificant linear relationship (p-value > 0.05) was observed between TSS and Chl-a (Figure \n\n3.1a) for Nav considering a log scale (Nav1: R = 0.44; Nav2: R = -0.18; Nav3: R = 0.42), which \n\nmeans that Nav is not dominated by phytoplankton. However, for BB, there is a significant \n\nrelationship for all three field trips (BB1: R = 0.75, p-value &lt;0.001; BB2: R = 0.60, p-value &lt;\n\n0.05; BB3: R = 0.74, p-value &lt;0.001) showing that phytoplankton was the main contributor of \n\nTSS. ?? (443) and Chl-a concentration (Figure 3.1b) did not show significant relationship (p-\n\nvalue > 0.05) for Nav1 (R = 0.42) and Nav2 (R = -0.22) on the other hand, for Nav3, we \n\nobserved a strong linear relationship (R = 0.81, p-value &lt;0.05). For BB, the correlation was \n\nstatistically significant for both BB1 (R = 0.92, p-value &lt;0.001) and BB2 (R = 0.52, p-value &lt;\n\n0.05). As reported by Le et al. (2015), the strong correlation between ?? (443) and Chl-a is \n\nassociated with high loads of nutrients in the aquatic system increasing phytoplankton \n\nproduction. According to Luzia (2004), the limiting nutrient that controls the growth of aquatic \n\nplants in majority of fresh waters is the inorganic form of phosphorus.  \n\nConsidering the relationship between ???? (443) and TSS (Figure 3.1c) for Nav, it was \n\ndifficult to notice any relationship (Nav1: R = 0.27; Nav2: R = -0.11; Nav3: R = 0.33, p-value \n\n> 0.05). For BB, the non-correlation was also observed for both field trips (BB1: R = -0.05; \n\nBB2: R = -0.37, p-value > 0.05). Now considering the relationship between ?????(443) and \n\nChl-a (Figure 3.1d) for Nav, again, no correlation was observed in any of the three campaigns \n\n(Nav1: R = 0.14; Nav2: R = 0.15; Nav3: R = 0.17, p-value > 0.05), while for BB1 the \n\nrelationship was significant (R = 0.77, p-value &lt;0.001) and weak for BB2 (R = 0.25, p-value \n\n> 0.05). Regarding the relationship between ????? (443) and TSS (Figure 3.1e), Nav did not \n\nshow any statistical correlation (Nav1: R = -0.06; Nav2: R = -0.18; Nav3: R = 0.14, p-value > \n\n0.05) whilst BB1 showed to be moderately (R = 0.53, p-value &lt;0.05) and weakly correlated \n\nfor BB2 (R = 0.19, p-value > 0.05). The non-correlation combined with the low Chl-a in Nav \n\ncan indicate that TSS and CDOM were possibly originated from land-based sources and not \n\nfrom phytoplankton degradation. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n41 \n\nFigure 3.1. Relationship between water quality and optical parameters considering data from \n\nall field campaigns. (a) TSS versus Chl-a, (b) ?? (443) versus Chl-a, (c) ????

(443) versus Chl-a. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3.2 Absorption coefficient budget \n\n \n\nThe relative contribution of phytoplankton, CDOM and NAP relative to the total \n\nabsorption without the water fraction (????) can be seen in Figure 3.2. The wavelengths chosen \n\nfor analysis (443, 560 and 665 nm) characterize the light interaction with dissolved organic \n\nmatter and particulate matter (BABIN et al., 2003; LE et al., 2013). The ternary plots show the \n\ncontribution and representativeness of certain OSC in the water and can be used to assist the \n\nestimation of these components using proper algorithms (MISHRA et al., 2014; RIDDICK et \n\nal., 2015). Figure 3.2(a) shows that at 443 nm, Nav1 was dominated by ???? with 43.24 \u00b1 6.52 \n\n%, Nav2 by ????? with 37.89 \u00b1 9.22 %, Nav3 by ???? 62.17 \u00b1 9.39 %. At 560 nm (Figure \n\n3.2b), Nav1, Nav2 and Nav3 were all dominated by ???? with 48.57 \u00b1 7.42 %, 46.87 \u00b1 10.11 \n\n% and 72.14 \u00b1 13.70 %, respectively. At 665 nm (Figure 3.2c), all three field trips were \n\ndominated by ?? (Nav1: 55.00 \u00b1 8.95 %, Nav2: 39.72 \u00b1 12.06 % and Nav3: 65.16 \u00b1 12.39 %). \n\nAs expected, the most dominant OSC in the absorption budget considering both field \n\ntrips and wavelengths in BB was the phytoplankton. At 443 nm (Figure 3.2a), BB 1 and BB 2 \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n42 \n\nwere dominated by ?? with a percentage of 45.72 \u00b1 12.71 % and 72.38 \u00b1 9.36 %. At 560 nm \n\n(Figure 3.2b), the ?? of BB 1 and BB 2 presented a percentage of 41.98 \u00b1 13.43 % and 63.33 \n\n\u00b1 13.75 %, respectively while at 665 nm (Figure 3.2c), the contribution was over 80% (BB 1 = \n\n85.38 \u00b1 6.80 % and BB 2: 87.90 \u00b1 6.38 %). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2. Ternary plot depicting the absorption coefficient budget of both Nav and BB \n\nreservoirs at three wavelengths: (a) 443 nm, (b) 560 nm and (c) 665 nm. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3.3 CDOM absorption \n\n \n\nThe ????? spectra approached to zero close to 700 nm and showed an exponential \n\ndecrease pattern from shorter to higher wavelengths (BRICAUD et al., 1981) with values at \n\n443 nm ranging between 0.06 to 0.45 m-1 in Nav and between 0.62 to 2.34 m-1 in BB (Figure \n\n3.3). The magnitude differs from one reservoir to another as well as from one season to another. \n\nValues from BB are like those found by Matthews and Bernard (2013), who stated an interval \n\nbetween 0.63 to 4.13 m-1 in three South African reservoirs. Wu et al. (2011) found values \n\nranging between 0.33 to 1.01 m-1 in Poyang Lake, China, considered a suspended inorganic \n\nmatter dominated water with low Chl-a concentration (1.47 \u2013 24.65 ?g l-1) while Campbell et \n\nal. (2011) reported an interval of 0.36 and 1.59 m-1 in three Australian reservoirs. Zhang et al. \n\n(2007) observed in Lake Taihu values ranging between 0.27 to 2.36 m-1. Binding et al. (2008) \n\nreported values at 440 nm ranging between 0.08 to 0.75 m-1 in Lake Erie (Canada/USA) that \n\nwas close to that found in Nav. The mean value for the spectral slope of CDOM (?????) was \n\n0.018 nm-1 for BB1 and 0.016 nm-1 for BB2, whilst for Nav1 the mean ????? was 0.020 nm\n-1 \n\nand 0.018 nm-1 for Nav2 and Nav3. Riddick et al. (2015) also found a mean ????? of 0.018 \n\nnm-1 in Kis-Balaton (wetland system) and 0.020 nm-1 in the Lake Balaton (freshwater lake in \n\ncentral Europe). On the other hand, Babin et al. (2003) reported a narrow range around 0.0176 \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n43 \n\nnm-1 in coastal waters around Europe. The authors highlighted that diverse protocols to retrieve \n\n????? can make it difficult to compare values from different regions. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3. Variability of ????? by field trip. (a) Nav1, (b) Nav2, (c) Nav3, (d) BB1, (e) BB2 \nand (f) the average value of ?????(?) for each field trip. Different y axes were applied for Nav \nand BB due to magnitude discrepancies. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3.4 Phytoplankton absorption \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 depicts the ?? spectra between 400 to 700 nm. The magnitude and shape are \n\ndifferent when we compare both reservoirs and this can be due to the diversity of trophic states \n\nand phytoplankton assemblages (MATTHEWS and BERNARD, 2013). The peaks at the blue \n\nand red regions are consistent with the typical diagnostic features of phytoplankton absorption \n\n(WU et al., 2011). At 440 nm, accessory pigments and Chl-a contribute with high absorption, \n\nwhile at 675 nm, Chl-a plus phaeophytin are primarily responsible for high absorption \n\n(SATHYENDRANATH et al., 1987; LE et al., 2009b). Other pigments such as carotenoids \n\nabsorb from 460 to 490 nm, however, this feature is not prominent in Nav neither BB.  \n\nThe absolute intervals of absorption at 443 nm are 0.05 \u2013 0.57 m-1 for Nav and 0.27 \u2013 \n\n10.34 m-1 for BB. Roesler et al. (1989) found values at 400 nm between 0.03 to 0.58 m-1 in \n\ninland marine waters in the USA, which was very close to that found in Nav. High values were \n\nreported in many turbid inland waters with characteristics close to that presented in BB (WU et \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n44 \n\nal., 2011, MATTHEWS and BERNARD, 2013, MISHRA et al., 2014). ?? at 443 nm exhibited \n\nan increased trend from the first to the second field campaigns, and the same happened for Nav \n\nconsidering the first to the third field trips.  \n\nMean ?? (620) ranged from 0.33 to 1.47 m\n-1 in BB and 0.04 to 0.10 m-1 in Nav. Chl-a \n\nconcentration showed a strong relationship with ?? (620) and BB1 (R\u00b2 = 0.80, p &lt;0.001, not \n\npresented here) but no correlation was found with BB2 (R\u00b2 = 0.11, p > 0.05) as well as with \n\nNav considering all three field trips (p > 0.05). The pigment phycocyanin, when present, can \n\nbe detected through the ?? spectrum especially at 620 nm. This pigment is a marker for \n\ncyanobacteria in eutrophic inland waters (SIMIS et al., 2005). Figure 3.1(b) showed the non-\n\nrelationship between ?? (443) and Chl-a in Nav, suggesting that Chl-a was not the only \n\npigment affecting ??, but other accessory pigments, such as carotenoid (WU et al., 2011). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4. Variability of ?? by field trip. (a) Nav1, (b) Nav2, (c) Nav3, (d) BB1, (e) BB2 and \n\n(f) the average value of ?? (?) for each field trip.

(Figure 3.5) is quite similar of ????? with an exponential \n\ndecrease from 400 to 700 nm. Visually, the seasonal pattern between field campaigns and \n\nreservoirs did not show remarkable changes as reported previously. Taking into account the \n\ndata from Nav, we observed that at 443 nm the values varied from 0.13 to 0.82 m-1 with averages \n\nvarying from 0.33 m-1 in Nav1, 0.27 m-1 in Nav2 and 0.61 m-1 in Nav3, showing that ???? (443) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n45 \n\nincreased in Nav3. Sample 5 from Nav2 stood out from the dataset because of the presence of \n\nsand dredging activity in that region leading to sediment resuspension. Meanwhile, BB showed \n\na range of 0.23 to 1.67 m-1 with averages varying from 0.45 m-1 in BB1 and 0.47 m-1 in BB2. \n\nSamples 17 to 20 placed at Tiet\u00ea River and confluence of Tiet\u00ea and Piracicaba Rivers presented \n\nthe highest values for ???? (443). These regions receive high loads of sediment from the \n\nmetropolitan region of S\u00e3o Paulo. The mean slope (????) of BB1 and BB2 was 0.007 and 0.008 \n\nnm-1, respectively, ranging between 0.006 to 0.01 nm-1 while for Nav the mean values were \n\n0.009, 0.006 and 0.007 nm-1, respectively, ranging between 0.003 to 0.011 nm-1. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.5.

It shows the \n\ncontribution of phytoplankton and non-algal particle. Besides the magnitude, the shapes of ?? \n\nfrom BB and Nav are clearly different, showing a smooth feature between 400 to 450 nm in \n\nNav and a marked feature in BB. These are due to the high contribution of NAP and CDOM at \n\nthis wavelength range, as also supported by Figure 3.1. On the contrary, BB was highly affected \n\nby photosynthetic pigments at the blue and red regions. The pattern from Nav was also observed \n\nby Meler et al. (2016) in Gulf of Gd\u00e1nsk during winter and in river mouths, Baltic Sea during \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n46 \n\nall seasons except summer. Wu et al. (2011) did not observe any feature at the blue and red \n\nregions due to high loads of inorganic sediment, which masked the phytoplankton contribution \n\nalong the spectra. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.6. Variability of ??(?) in all field trips.  (a) Nav1, (b) Nav2, (c) Nav3, (d) BB1, (e) \n\nBB2 and (f) the average value of ??(?) for each field trip. Different y axles were applied for \nNav and BB due to magnitude discrepancies. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.4. Discussion \n\n \n\nAs reported in many studies, BB as the first reservoir of the cascade system receives \n\nhigh loads of sediments coming from the metropolitan region of S\u00e3o Paulo and also from the \n\nPiracicaba River basin therefore, it acts as a great accumulator of nutrients (BARBOSA et al., \n\n1999, LUZIA, 2004, SMITH et al., 2014). The following reservoirs, on the other hand, start to \n\nreceive less nutrients decreasing the trophic state of these water bodies, such as Nav. The \n\nimplication of different sources of contaminant of the reservoirs characterizes the in-water \n\nconstituents. In case of BB, the ternary plot (Figure 3.2) showed that phytoplankton was the \n\nconstituent that dominated the water content in the visible spectrum and therefore, the water \n\noptical properties. At 443 nm, the phytoplankton contribution ranged between 20.71 to 87.14%. \n\nOn the other hand, Nav was dominated by both NAP and CDOM considering all three field \n\ntrips. Nav1 was dominated by NAP (25.87 \u2013 52.25%), Nav2 by CDOM (19.90 \u2013 58.88%) and \n\nNav3 also by NAP (44.85 \u2013 76.76%). Riddick et al. (2015) showed a phytoplankton variation \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n47 \n\nof 20 to 70% in Lake Balaton, whilst in coastal and sea waters, the contributions of NAP and \n\nCDOM, respectively, were dominant (BABIN et al., 2003; NAIK et al., 2013). A particularity \n\nwas highlighted by Ylostalo et al. (2014) who found high CDOM contribution in Borel lakes \n\n(48 \u2013 99% at 442 nm), which most of these lakes present low productivity and high organic \n\nmatter coming from the catchment basin. In Brazil, Ogashawara et al. (2016) also reported the \n\ndominance of CDOM in the ???? at 443 nm in both Funil and Itumbiara reservoirs. CDOM can \n\nbe originated by autochthones or allochthones sources and in sea waters this OSC co-varies \n\nwith phytoplankton biomass (BRICAUD et al., 1981), on the other hand, in inland waters the \n\norganic matter is mainly regulated by terrigenous inputs (Kirk 1994). These findings showed \n\nthat inland waters present high variability in terms of optical properties and this can be reflected \n\nin bio-optical modeling. \n\nThe dominance of phytoplankton in BB can be due to high loads of nutrients mainly \n\nphosphorus that increases the primary production (here represented by Chl-a as phytoplankton \n\nbiomass proxy). Inputs of phosphorus in the water is result of industry, domestic and agriculture \n\nactivities, including sediment liberation (CALIJURI et al., 2002). High loads of this nutrient \n\nwere reported in BB during summer (LUZIA, 2004, SMITH et al., 2014). It was observed that \n\nChl-a was highly correlated (0.60 &lt;R &lt;0.75) with TSS in all three BB field trips, assuming \n\nthat the sediment produced in the aquatic system was represented mainly by phytoplankton. \n\nZhang et al. (2009a) showed the influence of seasonal and temporal cycle into Chl-a \n\nconcentration. They observed a significant positive correlation with TSS during spring, summer \n\nand autumn and related this to the frequent algal blooms in Lake Taihu, China. Algal blooms \n\nwere also observed during BB2 campaign and the presence of cyanobacteria was also noticed \n\n(Figure 3.4e). Sotero-Santos et al. (2006) pointed relevant conditions to grant cyanobacteria to \n\nbloom almost year-round in BB and they were: water column stability, low N:P ratio, moderate \n\nto high nutrient levels, mild or no winds and low turbulence.  \n\nOn the contrary, Nav showed the dominance of NAP in the absorption budget \n\ncorroborated to the non-correlation between Chl-a and TSS (Figure 3.1a). Reservoirs work as \n\nan effective trap for phosphorus and the concentration can decline from 80 to 90% during the \n\ntransition of water through a reservoir (STRASKRABA, 1994). This finding was described by \n\nLuzia (2004), who registered a decrease of 93% of phosphorus from BB to Tr\u00eas Irm\u00e3os, the last \n\nreservoir of the cascade system of Tiet\u00ea River. Thus, the reduction of the limiting nutrient lead \n\nalso to reduction of primary production in downstream reservoirs such as Nav, which presented \n\nvery low Chl-a concentration. However, studying the upstream portion of Nav in Tiet\u00ea River \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n48 \n\nto be exact, Cicerelli (2013) found the presence of phycocyanin (7.12 \u00b1 10.05 \u00b5g l-1) and high \n\nChl-a concentration (47.54 \u00b1 34.21 \u00b5g l-1) in the summer with maximum Chl-a of 150.96 \u00b5g l-\n\n1. The author attributed this outcome to the combination of high temperature, rainfall and low \n\nwind speeds leading to the increase of turbidity, decrease of dissolved oxygen possibly related \n\nto the decomposition of organic matter. This means that rainfall provide optimal meteorological \n\nconditions for bloom formation during summer and many sources of nutrients can induce the \n\nalgal blooms such as animal waste, agriculture and fertilizer runoff from the watershed (AHN \n\net al., 2002; ANDERSON et al., 2002). \n\nThe IOPs as well as the OSCs parameters showed seasonal and local variability \n\nconsidering both BB and Nav reservoirs. A decrease of organic matter from BB to Nav was \n\nreflected in ?????(443) values and the correlation between ?????(443) and Chl-a in BB1 \n\n(Figure 3.1d) suggest that the source of CDOM was originated from the decomposition of algal \n\nand aquatic vegetation within the reservoir. The low correlation observed in BB2 even with \n\nhigh concentrations of Chl-a can be explained by the delay between algal bloom and Chl-a \n\ndegradation that starts to occur after the spring bloom promoting the increase of CDOM \n\nabsorption. This situation was reported by Sasaki et al. (2005), who studied Funka Bay in Japan \n\nand observed a time lag between the beginning of increasing both CDOM absorption and Chl-\n\na concentration relationship. Zhang et al. (2009c) observed that phytoplankton can be an \n\nimportant CDOM producer in eutrophic waters and its degradation can release nutrients in a \n\nvery rapid way being remineralized as nutrient input to the next phytoplankton bloom.  \n\nDifferently, Nav did not show any correlation between both variables, strongly \n\nsuggesting the allochthonous source of CDOM. The average ?????(443) in BB ranging \n\nbetween 0.62 to 2.34 m-1 was coherent with values from turbid inland waters such as Lake \n\nTaihu, very known about its high productivity. Meanwhile, Nav showed values comparable to \n\nthose from Lake Erie (?????(440) ranging from 0.08 to 0.75), also with low Chl-a \n\nconcentration and no correlation between ????? (440) and Chl-a. In addition, the ????? from \n\nboth reservoirs agreed with those mentioned in the literature for coastal and inland waters. Nav \n\nshowed a variation of 0.016 to 0.023 nm-1 with a mean of 0.019 nm-1 whilst BB ranged between \n\n0.014 to 0.019 nm-1 with a mean of 0.018 nm-1. High ????? values (0.011 \u2013 0.025 nm\n-1) were \n\nreported by Babin et al. (2003), who studied a variety of European waters, and Binding et al. \n\n(2008), who verified a range between 0.013 to 0.020 nm-1 in Lake Erie. ????? can be an \n\nindicative of CDOM molecular weight and low ????? implies high molecular weight and less-\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n49 \n\naltered CDOM, on the other hand, steeper slopes is related to low molecular weight and high \n\ndegraded CDOM (TWARDOWSKI et al., 2004; BELZILE and GUO, 2006). \n\nAs previously described, the average ?? (?) performed for BB and Nav showed distinct \n\nfeatures along the spectrum with high differences in magnitudes. The average ?? (?) \n\nnormalized by ?? (443) showed distinctions between data from both reservoirs (Figure 3.7a). \n\nAs we can see at wavelengths toward the ultraviolet region, Nav3 stood out from the others \n\nindicating an increasing trend of absorption at this spectral region. We can see at Figure 3.6c \n\nthat some curves presented an exponential trend at shorter wavelengths, masking the diagnostic \n\nfeature of phytoplankton pigment at 443 nm. Binding et al. (2008) reported a portion of the \n\nparticulate absorption that cannot be assigned to phytoplankton pigments, mineral sediments, \n\nor organic detritus but can be attributed to particle-bound dissolved organic matter. The authors \n\nalso highlighted that this fraction can be retained during filtration and incorporated into \n\nphytoplankton absorption signal giving this exponential shape, besides, they affirmed that this \n\nsituation is more predominant in mineral dominated waters even with moderate concentrations \n\nof dissolved organic matter. The shape of Nav3, BB1 and BB2 was quite similar from 450 to \n\n700 nm and a feature between 550 to 650 nm was also enhanced in all three spectra being \n\ncharacteristic of phycobilipigments (phycocyanin) (MATTHEWS and BERNARD, 2013). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.7. (a) Variation of ?? (?)/?? (443) ratio as a function of wavelength considering the \n\naverage values of BB and Nav and the mass-specific absorption of phytoplankton, ??\n? (?), for \n\nall field campaigns (b) Nav1, (c) Nav2, (d) Nav3, (e) BB1 and (f) BB2. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n50 \n\nAccording to Bricaud et al. (1995) the ??\n? (?) values tend to decrease with increasing \n\nChl-a concentrations probably due to package effect, which can be observed at Figure 3.7 (b-f) \n\nwith Nav1 and Nav2 presenting a higher ??\n? (?) values for axis y in relation to Nav3, BB1 and \n\nBB2. The ??\n? (443) and ??\n\n? (675) are absorption features of Chl-a and the accessory pigment. \n\nThe average of ??\n? (675) values for Nav1, Nav2 and Nav3 were 0.018, 0.003 and 0.009 m2 mg-\n\n1, respectively whilst for BB1 and BB2, the values were 0.004 and 0.007 m2 mg-1. Matthews \n\nand Bernard (2013) highlighted that the mean value of ??\n? (443) is affected by the trophic state \n\nof the water decreasing from oligotrophic to hypertrophic classes. In this case, the mean \n\n??\n? (443) values related to Nav1, Nav 2 and Nav3 were 0.032, 0.035 and 0.015 m2 mg-1 and for \n\nBB1 and BB2 were 0.007 and 0.011 m2 mg-1, which agreed with the previous authors. \n\nNav produced an average ???? of 0.007 \u00b1 0.002 nm\n-1 and BB of 0.008 \u00b1 0.001 nm-1, \n\nwhich is close to the ones found in other reservoirs (0.0095 \u00b1 0.0004 nm-1, 0.0103 \u00b1 0.0013 nm-\n\n1 and 0.0098 \u00b1 0.0011 nm-1 [MATTHEWS and BERNARD, 2013] and the ranges 0.008 \u2013 \n\n0.0088, 0.0123 \u2013 0.0153 and 0.0086 \u2013 0.0089 [CAMPBELL et al., 2011]) or Lake Erie (0.0077 \n\n\u2013 0.017 nm-1 [BINDING et al., 2008]) and lakes in boreal region (0.0075 \u2013 0.0128 nm-1 \n\n[YLOSTALO et al., 2014]) but below the values reported by Riddick et al. (2015) who found \n\nan average of 0.015 \u00b1 0.004 nm-1 in Lake Balaton. Values from ocean were also higher than the \n\nones found in Nav and BB (0.0094 \u00b1 0.0018 nm-1 [BRICAUD et al., 2010] and 0.011 \u00b1 0.0025 \n\nnm-1 [BRICAUD et al., 1998]) or even coastal waters (0.0123 \u00b1 0.0013 nm-1 [BABIN et al., \n\n2003]). This variability can be related to proportion of mineral and organic fraction that was \n\nsuggested by Babin et al. (2003) after observe that a low ???? (average 0.0117 nm\n-1) was \n\nassigned to waters with mineral particles whilst high ???? (average 0.0128 nm\n-1) was linked to \n\norganic matter dominated water. However, Riddick et al. (2015) found the opposite relationship \n\nas well as Binding et al. (2008) and Ylostalo et al. (2014) who did not found any trend between \n\n???? and organic content of TSS. According to Figure 3.8a, we can observe the small variability \n\nbetween Nav and BB slopes not showing a wide range of particle types, however, following the \n\nlogic from Babin et al. (2003), BB depicted the highest values in comparison with Nav \n\nsuggesting the organic matter dominating composition. To test this hypothesis and regarding \n\nthe availability of OSS data from BB, Figure 3.8b depicted an increase trend between organic \n\nmatter and ????, agreeing with Babin et al. (2003). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n51 \n\nFigure 3.8. (a) Variation of ???? (?)/???? (443) ratio as a function of wavelength considering \nthe averages values of BB and Nav and (b) the relationship between ????  and OSS (mg l\n\n-1) \n\nfrom BB. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.5 Conclusion \n\n \n\nThe OSCs collected between 2014 to 2016 showed considerable changes between BB \n\nand Nav, and according to the relationship between TSS and Chl-a we could have the first \n\ninsight about the main component of both systems. BB was considered phytoplankton \n\ndominated water while Nav was inorganic matter dominated water. Which means that the water \n\nalong the cascade tends to have low primary production. The same happened with the IOPs, \n\nwith decreasing trend in absorption coefficient from BB to Nav, also reflecting the improvement \n\nof trophic state. \n\n?? (443) was correlated to Chl-a in BB1, BB2 and in Nav3, which means that \n\nenvironmental conditions changed the water quality in Nav3. The main cause of this was \n\nattributed to meteorological forcing during the periods of collection and according to Figure \n\n2.3, a drought condition was installed from 2013 to 2015, leading to the limitation of rainfall \n\nrate. After that, in 2016, the rainfall conditions were recovered increasing the availability of \n\nnutrients and consequently, the increase of primary production. A feature between 550 to 650 \n\nnm was also enhanced in BB1, BB2 and Nav3 spectra being characteristic of phycobilipigments \n\n(phycocyanin). \n\n?????(443) was correlated to Chl-a in BB1 showing that most of CDOM was \n\noriginated from the decomposition of phytoplankton, differently from Nav that did not show \n\nany correlation between both variables, indicating an allochthonous source of CDOM. BB \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n52 \n\npresented ?? (443) values in accordance with productive inland waters, nonetheless, Nav \n\nshowed values included in the same range reported for inland marine waters, illustrating the \n\noptical variability between both reservoirs. The ??\n?\n\n from Nav and BB corroborated with the \n\nassumption that at 443 nm the trophic state of the water decrease from oligotrophic to \n\nhypereutrophic.  \n\nThe ???? (?) did not show seasonal pattern between field campaigns and reservoirs and \n\nthe ???? depicted low variability between BB and Nav with a slight increase at BB data. The \n\nincrease trend found with the relationship of ???? and OSS highlighted the domain of organic \n\nmatter in BB as suggested by Babin et al. (2003). The ??(?) enhanced the previous findings \n\nabout both reservoirs, that is, BB was highly influenced by phytoplankton pigments along the \n\nvisible spectrum while Nav showed only the feature at 675 nm represented by Chl-a absorption \n\nand high contribution of NAP at the blue region. The implication of different biogeochemical \n\nand optical properties in two reservoirs on the same river can make it difficult to use a single \n\nmodel in order to estimate the OSCs. For that reason, new approaches based on analytical \n\nmodels should be useful for retrieving the optical water quality.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n53 \n\nCHAPTER 4: RETRIEVAL OF INHERENT OPTICAL PROPERTIES FROM \n\nOLIGO-TO-MESOTROPHIC INLAND WATER USING THE QUASI-ANALYTICAL \n\nALGORITHM \n\n \n\n4.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nInland waters, represented by rivers, lakes and reservoirs, play a key role in hydrological \n\ncycle providing different habitats and ecosystem services (BR\u00d6NMARK and HANSSON, \n\n2002). As many other ecosystems, inland waters have increasingly been under anthropogenic \n\nor developmental pressure from industry, agriculture and urban activities increasing nutrient \n\nloading and other organic and inorganic pollution (PALMER et al., 2015). Infusion of nutrients \n\n(N and P) from the land via runoff often leads to eutrophication increasing the primary \n\nproduction of phytoplankton and macrophytes (PAERL et al., 2011). In oligo-to-mesotrophic \n\nreservoirs, the submersed species of macrophytes, which are usually rooted, occupy the edges \n\nand often the slow-moving zones of rivers. They are dependent on the sediments and light \n\navailability for their optimal growth (WELCH AND LINDELL, 1992). The clarity of the water \n\nis affected by turbidity generated from sediments or other suspended particles, algae and the \n\nnatural color of the water. Frequent spatio-temporal monitoring of the physical, chemical and \n\nbiological processes is of great importance to lake and reservoir management, however, the \n\nTiet\u00ea reservoirs, as well as many other Brazilian water bodies, are being affected by \n\nanthropogenic activities such as agriculture and expansion of urban centers. They are still being \n\nmanaged using traditional methods of in situ data collection with spatio-temporal limitation. \n\nThe monitoring follows specific goals by selecting strategic locations. Therefore, accurate \n\nremote sensing models and techniques can be a powerful tool to complement conventional \n\napproaches in reservoirs monitoring (PALMER et al., 2015). \n\nYacobi et al. (2011), Odermatt et al. (2012) and Palmer et al. (2015) highlighted the \n\nmain scientific contributions and challenges regarding the study of complex waters using \n\nremote sensing. The variability within this type of water, in terms of concentrations as well as \n\nthe SIOP of Chl-a, TSS and CDOM can be difficult to separate. On the other hand, in open \n\nocean, the concentrations of NAP and CDOM are directly correlated with phytoplankton. This \n\nmeans that in certain wavelengths, such as at the blue and green, it is possible to retrieve Chl-a \n\nconcentration in open ocean but is not appropriate for inland waters, because CDOM and NAP \n\nhave strong overlapping absorption particularly in the blue spectral region. To address this \n\nissue, many efforts have been made to understand the bio-optical properties of inland waters in \n\norder to retrieve the OSCs by using an inversion model based on empirical and analytical \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n54 \n\napproaches (MOREL, 1980; CARDER et al., 1999). In general, the inversion models first \n\nderive the IOPs using in situ measured AOP and then retrieve the OSC concentration \n\n(SHANMUGAM et al., 2010). \n\nThe empirical approach do not use the IOPs to retrieve water quality parameters, but a \n\nstatistical relationship between an AOP, such as the remote sensing reflectance (???) or the \n\nirradiance reflectance (?), and a known OSC (GOULD et al., 2001; SATHYENDRANATH et \n\nal., 2001; RITCHIE et al., 2003). The method is often time and site limited and according to \n\nOgashawara (2015), it does not relate to any physical principle. The semi-analytical and quasi-\n\nanalytical (QAA) algorithms are based on radiative transfer theory and often include some \n\nempirical steps (CARDER et al., 1999; DEKKER et al., 2002; BRANDO et al., 2012; \n\nODERMATT et al., 2012). Semi-analytical algorithm estimates the total absorption coefficient, \n\n?? (?), by the sum of the absorption coefficient of phytoplankton, ??, absorption coefficient of \n\nCDOM, ?????, and absorption coefficient of NAP, ????, while QAA estimates ?? just using \n\n???. The semi-analytical model also estimates the backscattering coefficient, ?? (?), by \n\nsumming the backscattering of each in-water constituent except for CDOM while the QAA \n\nretrieves ?? (?) according to Gordon and Morel (1983). \n\nThe original QAA by Lee et al. (2002) was initially developed to retrieve absorption \n\nand backscattering properties in open ocean and coastal waters and later re-parametrized for \n\nturbid inland waters (LE et al., 2009a; YANG et al., 2013; MISHRA et al., 2014). The model \n\nfollows several steps mixing empirical and analytical approaches (Table 4.1) to derive the IOPs \n\nusing radiative transfer equations, considering the reference wavelength (?0) at 555 nm (LEE \n\net al., 2002). At this wavelength, the contribution of total suspended matter is very high in turbid \n\neutrophic waters which requires ?0 to be shifted to longer wavelengths such as 710 nm (LE et \n\nal., 2009a), 754 nm (YANG et al., 2013) and 708 nm (MISHRA et al., 2013; MISHRA et al., \n\n2014). Lee et al. (2002) also showed the performance of QAA using 640 nm as reference \n\nwavelength and noticed considerable improvement in high-absorption environments with \n\n?? (440) higher than 0.3 m\n-1, however, Le et al. (2009a) emphasized the importance of more \n\nvalidation to improve the performance of this approach. In mesotrophic inland waters, Yacobi \n\net al. (2011) highlighted that at wavelengths longer than 600 nm, aw increases over other OSCs, \n\nwhich means that at shorter wavelengths the contribution of other OSC but water is dominant \n\ndecreasing the performance of QAA in this type of water. \n\nThe performance of QAAs in inland waters have been tested by various researchers; \n\nhowever, the sites considered were all highly turbid and eutrophic inland waters. For instance, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n55 \n\nLe et al. (2009a) studied the turbid Taihu Lake with Chl-a concentration ranging between 3.07 \n\n\u2013 299.60 \u00b5g l-1, while Yang et al. (2013) studied three turbid Asian lakes with Chl-a varying \n\nbetween 9,790 \u2013 153,920 \u00b5g l-1 and Mishra et al. (2014) explored the performance of QAA in \n\naquaculture ponds dominated by cyanobacteria with Chl-a ranging between 960 \u2013 1,380 mg m-\n\n3 and ?? accounting for 54% of ?? (443). The main modification carried out by these studies \n\nbesides shifting ?0 to the near-infrared (NIR), was in the estimation of the spectral slope of \n\nparticle backscattering (?). These findings opened a new frontier of QAA application based on \n\nre-parameterizations for inland waters, however, still, there is a lack of research related to oligo-\n\nto-mesotrophic environments with Chl-a ranging between low to moderate and ??  not being \n\ndominated by phytoplankton but CDOM and NAP. \n\nIn order to understand the bio-optical properties of a non-productive tropical reservoir, \n\nthis work aimed to re-parametrize and validate the QAA based on the band architecture of OLCI \n\n(Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) sensor onboard Sentinel-3 (launched in February 16, \n\n2016). The specific objectives were: i) to identify a ?0 where ?? is dominant; ii) to parameterize \n\nthe empirical steps used in ?? derivation, such as the ?? (?0) and ?; iii) to calibrate ? and ? \n\nassociated with ?? and ?????, respectively, and iv) to replace the original steps associated with \n\n?? estimation for oligo-to-mesotrophic waters and propose an alternative method in order to \n\navoid negative predictions. \n\n \n\n4.2 Data and methods \n\n \n\nFrom all samples collected in the field, a total of 51 were used in this study for \n\ncalibration (Nav 1: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20), validation (Nav \n\n2: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20) and temporal comparison (Nav 3: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \n\n6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19) (see Figure 2.1 for sampling stations location). \n\n \n\n4.2.1 Water quality parameters \n\n \n\nWater samples were collected just below the air-water interface and then filtered on the \n\nsame day of collection under vacuum pressure through a pre-ashed and pre-weighed Whatman \n\nfiberglass GF/F filter with a porosity of 0.7 ?m, and then frozen (-25\u00b0C) for further TSS \n\nlaboratory analysis. Chl-a was extracted with 90% acetone solution and analyzed \n\nspectrophotometrically (GOLTERMAN et al., 1978). The TSS concentration was determined \n\nby applying the method described by APHA (1998), in which the filters were dried in the oven \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n56 \n\nat 100\u00b0 C for 12h, and then weighed using an analytical scale. To retrieve the ISS, the dried was \n\nsubjected to a muffle furnace for 75 min at 550\u00b0 C and weighed again. At the end, the TSS and \n\ninorganic fraction were determined and to estimate the OSS the last weighted filter was \n\nsubtracted from the original filter weight after first drying. \n\n \n\n4.2.2 In-Situ Radiometric Data \n\n \n\nThe ??? spectra were estimated from radiometric measurements taken between 10 a.m. \n\nto 2 p.m. This procedure was carried out in order to maintain consistent acquisition geometry \n\nbased on the time window of light availability (MOBLEY, 1999). At each sample station, below \n\nand above water readings were acquired using hyperspectral radiometers RAMSES TriOS\u00ae \n\n(TriOS, Germany) operating in the spectral range between 400 and 900 nm. The radiance sensor \n\nwas equipped with a 7\u00ba field-of-view and the irradiance sensor with a cosine collector. Before \n\nbeing used, the radiometric quantities such as the total upwelling radiance \n\n(?? (?); W m\n?2sr?1nm?1), incident sky radiance (??(?); W m\n\n?2sr?1nm?1) and downwelling \n\nirradiance incident onto the water surface (?? (?); W m\n?2nm?1) were subjected to a linear \n\ninterpolation to transform the original spectral resolution of ~ 3.3 nm to 1 nm. This procedure \n\nwas designed to homogenize RAMSES measurements between the sensors, since they have \n\ndifferent wavelength values.  \n\nThe sampling rate was around 15 s per sample resulting in 16 readings at each sampling \n\nlocation. From these measurements, a median value was retrieved to represent the spectrum of \n\nthat location. The acquisition geometry followed the protocol described by Mueller (2000) and \n\nMobley (1999). Care was taken to avoid the effects of specular reflectance and boat shading \n\nthe instruments were positioned on a steel frame and the ?? sensor was set with a viewing angle \n\nof 40\u00ba from nadir and an azimuth of 135\u00ba (oriented from the sun), and the ?? sensor was set with \n\nthe same angles, 40\u00ba from zenith and 135\u00ba azimuth. ???(sr\n?1) spectra were calculated from the \n\nradiometric profiles in accordance with Mobley (1999): \n\n \n\n???(?) =\n?? (?) ? ???(?)\n\n?? (?)\n (4.1) \n\n \n\nwhere ? is the proportionality factor that considers the wind speed and sky radiance distribution. \n\n? was chosen as 0.028 since the average wind speed did not exceed 5 m s-1 during data \n\ncollection and the geometry of acquisition was kept the same as Mobley (1999). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n57 \n\nIn situ ??? is the main input data for QAA to retrieve OSC concentration. However, for \n\nbroader applicability of a model, it is necessary to match the hyperspectral data with satellite \n\ndata by using the spectral response functions of the sensor of choice. In this study, Ocean and \n\nLand Colour Instrument (OLCI - Sentinel-3 satellite) bands spectral response functions was \n\nconvolved with in situ ??? data to derive the band-weighted reflectance data (GORDON, 1995): \n\n \n\n???\n????(?? ) =\n\n? ?(?)???(?)\n??\n\n??\n\n? ?(?)\n??\n\n??\n\n (4.2) \n\n \n\nwhere ???\n???? is the in situ ??? matching the band width of OLCI sensor in Sentinel-3A satellite; \n\n?? and ??  are the lower and upper limit of the band ??. S(?) is the spectral response function of \n\nthe ith spectral band of OLCI (PELLOQUIN and NIEKE, 2012). \n\n \n\n4.2.3 In Situ Inherent Optical Properties \n\n \n\nWater samples were filtered through a 0.7 ?m porosity GF/F fiberglass that was stored \n\nflat under freezing condition. The determination of the total particulate (algal and non-algal) \n\nabsorption (??) was performed by an integrating sphere module presented in the double-beam \n\nShimadzu UV-2600 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU, Japan), with spectral sampling \n\nfrom 280 nm to 800 nm. A white filter, wetted with ultrapure water was used as reference. The \n\nfilter containing the particulate was positioned in the integrating sphere to measure their optical \n\ndensity (OD). The T-R (Transmittance-Reflectance) filter-pad technique presented by Tassan \n\nand Ferrari (1995, 2002) was employed to obtain ??. To acquire the phytoplankton (??) and \n\ndetritus (??) absorption coefficients, the filter underwent pigmentation bleaching with 10% \n\nsodium hypochlorite (NaClO), ensuring that the samples do not contain any pigment \n\ninterference. Using empirical relationships described by Tassan and Ferrari (1995, 2002), the \n\nrespective coefficients were determined, and ?? was obtained by the difference between the \n\nOD of the total particulate and detritus fractions. \n\nTo estimate the CDOM absorption coefficient (?????), water samples were filtered \n\nthrough a fiberglass Whatman GF/F with 0.7 ?m pores, and then re-filtered under low vacuum \n\npressure using a Whatman nylon membrane filter with 0.2 ?m pores. The readings were \n\nperformed using the absorbance mode, and the samples were placed in a 10 cm quartz cuvette. \n\nFor each set of measurements, a reference reading was performed containing Milli-Q water, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n58 \n\nand for each read sample (ODsample), the reference absorbance value (ODreference) was subtracted. \n\nThe ODsample was converted to absorption coefficient according to the equation (3.2): \n\nA baseline correction was performed by subtracting the average value between 700 and \n\n750 nm from all the spectrum values (BABIN et al., 2003). This procedure was used because \n\nCDOM absorption is negligible at this range and the temperature and salinity have a slight \n\neffect on water absorption (GREEN and BLOUGH, 1994). Due to the similarities in the \n\nabsorption spectrum and the difficulty in separating ????? and ?? fractions from their total \n\nabsorption coefficient, many studies have treated both components as a single measure, such as \n\nthe ???? comprised of the sum of ????? and ?? (LEE et al., 1994; SHANMUGAM et al., \n\n2011; ZHU et al., 2011). The spectral slope of ???? (????) is a constant obtained by the \n\nexponential fit within the 400 \u2013 700 nm wavelength range (MISHRA et al., 2014). \n\n \n\n4.2.4 QAA General Context \n\n \n\nFollowing the first step from QAA, ?? (?) was retrieved based on several parameters \n\ndescribed in Table 4.1. The success in determining ?? (?) is of great importance in estimations \n\nof ?? (?) and the OSC absorption coefficients (CDM and phytoplankton). The partitioning of \n\n?? (?) into ???? (?) followed the same flow proposed by Lee et al. (2002), however, to derive \n\n?? (?) an alternative step (see section \u201cRe-parametrization of QAA to derive ??\u201d) was needed, \n\nto avoid negative values due to low ?? (?) signal in Nav. \n\nThree existing models were used to test their performances using Nav\u2019s dataset \n\nconvoluted to OLCI bands: the models proposed by Lee et al. (2009, 2014) referred to as \n\nQAALv5 and QAALv6 for versions 5 (?0 = 560 nm) and 6 (?0 = 665 nm) available at the \n\nInternational Ocean Colour Coordinating Group (IOCCG) website (URL: \n\nhttp://www.ioccg.org/groups/software.html). The third model was based on Mishra et al. (2014) \n\nreferred to as QAAM14 (?0 = 709 nm). The performance of the new re-parametrized model \n\ndeveloped in this study (QAAOMR), was also compared with the three existing models.  \n\n \n\nTable 4.1.

For this step, water samples collected in the first field trip were analyzed in laboratory \n\nby filter-pad technique to retrieve ?? , ???? and ?? including ?? (?) from Pope and Fry (1997) \n\ncombined to obtain ?? (?). The re-parametrization steps in QAAOMR primarily involved \n\nmodifying the intermediary steps such as computation of ?, ?? (?0) and ? for ?? estimation (see \n\nTable 4.1). After that, the decomposition of ?? into ???? and ?? was also evaluated by \n\ncomparing with in situ measures. In order to validate the newly parametrized model related to \n\noligo-to-mesotrophic waters, the samples collected in the second field trip were used. \n\nThe statistical indicators used for validation were the total root mean square difference \n\n(RMSD), bias, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and to provide a broader statistical \n\noverview of the error, the normalized bias (B*), normalized standard deviation (?*), linear \n\ncorrelation (R) and normalized unbiased RMSD (uRMSD*) were also applied. The term \n\nnormalized stands for all statistical metrics divided by the standard deviation of the reference \n\nand here named as ?????, while the term unbiased, emphasize that the measure removes any \n\ninformation about the potential bias. ?* and R represent the magnitude of data dispersion and \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n60 \n\nshape patterns. To obtain the ideal situation, magnitude and shape may consider that ?* = R = \n\n1, which leads to the minimum uRMSD*. \n\nA different perspective about the contribution of the error was achieved using the Taylor \n\nand Target graphics (TAYLOR, 2001; JOLLIFF et al., 2009). In the polar coordinate diagram \n\n(Taylor graphic), the radial (along-axis) distance from the origin is related to ?? and the angular \n\nposition corresponds to R. The distance between the reference and the modeled points are \n\nproportional to uRMSD*. The observation is the reference point, which is indicated by the polar \n\ncoordinates (1.0, 1.0) when we consider that the metrics are normalized. The target diagram \n\nconsiders the Cartesian plane (uRMSD*, B*) where uRMSD* > 0 means that the model standard \n\ndeviation is larger than the reference, whilst uRMSD* &lt;0 indicates the contrary. B* >0 signifies \n\npositive bias while B* &lt;0 negative. The quantities may be normalized to remove the units. The \n\nTaylor graphic can be displayed in 90\u00b0 or as presented here in 180\u00b0 covering negative \n\ncorrelations. Values of ?? higher than 2.0 were not depicted while B* and uRMSD* higher than \n\n3 and/or less than -3 were also disregarded in the Target diagrams. This condition was used to \n\navoid presenting huge error models. \n\nThe error indices are defined according to Equations (4.3) to (4.8): \n\n \n\n???? = ?\n1\n\n?\n?(????,? ? ?????,? )\n\n2\n?\n\n?=1\n\n (4.3) \n\n???? =\n100%\n\n?\n? |\n\n????,? ? ?????,?\n?????,?\n\n|\n\n?\n\n?=1\n\n (4.4) \n\n?? = (\n?????? ? ???????\n\n?????\n) (4.5) \n\n?? =\n????\n\n?????\n (4.6) \n\n? =\n\n1\n?\n\n? (????,? ? ?????? )(?????,? ? ???????)\n?\n?=1\n\n?????????\n (4.7) \n\n?????? = ????(???? ? ?????)?1 + ?\n?2 ? 2??? (4.8) \n\n \n\nwhere n is the number of samples, ????,? and ?????,? are represent the estimated and measured \n\nvalues, respectively. ??????  and ??????? represent the average of estimated and measured values, \n\nrespectively. ????? and ????  are the standard deviation of the measured and the estimated \n\nvalues, respectively.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n61 \n\n4.3 Results and Discussion \n\n \n\n4.3.1 Biogeochemical characterization \n\n \n\nSamples collected during the first field trip showed very low concentrations of Chl-a \n\n(average of 5.95 \u00b5g l-1) and TSS (average of 0.63 mg l-1) and average Secchi Disk Depth of \n\n3.22 m (Table 4.2). The OSC concentration in the samples collected during the second field trip \n\nshowed a modest increase with Chl-a (average of 7.94 \u00b5g l-1) and TSS (average of 1.58 mg l-1) \n\nand average Secchi Disk Depth of 3.14 m. In situ collected ?? (443) represented non-productive \n\nwaters with values ranging between 0.72 \u2013 1.52 m-1 from the first field trip and 0.58 \u2013 1.45 m-\n\n1\n from the second field trip. Lee et al. (2002) recommended their open ocean version of QAA \n\nto be applied for datasets where ?? (443) is less than 0.3 m\n-1 and in NAV the ?? (443) was \n\nhigher than this threshold, therefore a poor performance was expected from the native QAA \n\napproach. \n\n \n\nTable 4.2.

The water \n\ntransparency is negatively correlated with rainfall and according to Table 4.2 the Secchi Depth \n\nrange changed from 2.29 \u2013 4.80 m during the beginning of the dry season to 0.90 \u2013 4.65 m at \n\nthe end of the dry season (RIBEIRO FILHO et al., 2011). Smith et al. (2014) highlighted that \n\nthe high concentrations of suspended matter during rainy season in Nav can be attributed to the \n\nrunoff effect. Slight differences in limnological parameters from one field trip to another was \n\nobserved and as stated by Smith et al. (2014), factors such as water level fluctuation and \n\nseasonality are of great importance for the changes in geochemical dynamics of the reservoir. \n\nThe relationship (not shown here) between Chl-a and TSS concentrations during the first (R2 = \n\n0.12, p > 0.05, n = 18) and second (R2 = 0.07, p > 0.05, n = 14) field campaigns indicated the \n\nnon-productive property of Nav, which was mostly dominated by inorganic matter. \n\n \n\n4.3.2 Bio-optical characterization \n\n \n\nThe reciprocal of remote sensing reflectance (???\n?1, Figure 4.1) is considered a proxy for \n\nabsorption (GORDON et al., 1975) by corresponding OSCs in the water body. The main \n\nfeatures in the ???  spectra acquired during both field trips were related to dissolved and \n\nparticulate matter absorption at shorter wavelengths. At longer wavelengths such as at ~560 nm \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n63 \n\nthe low magnitude was due to the weak absorption by pigments and scattering from \n\nphytoplankton cells (ROESLER et al., 1989; GITELSON, 1992; CHENG et al., 2013). Strong \n\nabsorption from 600 nm onwards followed a shape similar to ?? (red line) inferring that beyond \n\n600 nm the contribution of others OSCs was minor in both datasets. In addition, the red \n\nabsorption features were also related to Chl-a at 675 nm (GITELSON, 1992). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1. Reciprocal remote sensing reflectance (???\n?1) data from the (a) first, (b) second and \n\n(c) third field trips. Pure water absorption (?? ) (red line) is shown for reference. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe blue spectral region in Nav\u2019s dataset did not present any prominent feature of \n\nabsorption related to phytoplankton pigments, on the contrary, it remained flat up to 560 nm. \n\nThe same pattern was also noticed in another oligo-to-mesotrophic reservoir in Brazil \n\n(OGASHAWARA et al., 2014). This feature was documented by Doxaran et al. (2002) who \n\nreported the increase of ??? between 550 and 850 nm with increasing TSS concentration. \n\n \n\n4.3.3 OSC relative contribution \n\n \n\nThe relative contribution of phytoplankton, CDOM and detritus absorption to the total \n\nabsorption budget without the water fraction (????) can be visualized in Figure 4.2. The \n\nwavelengths chosen for analysis (443, 560 and 665 nm) characterize the light interaction with \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n64 \n\nparticulate and dissolved organic matter (LE et al., 2013; ZHANG et al., 2009b; LOOS, 2010). \n\nAccording to the ternary plots, the first set of field data were dominated by ??, mainly in the \n\nblue (443 nm) and green (560 nm) wavelengths with 52.05 \u00b1 6.37 % and 56.78 \u00b1 8.80 % \n\nrespectively. ?? dominated in the red (655 nm) wavelength with 59.87 \u00b1 8.34 % contribution \n\ntowards ????. The contribution of the OSCs was a little more balanced in the second field \n\ndataset. At 443 nm, the ????? contributed with 37.22 \u00b1 9.18 % while at 560 nm, the ?? \n\naccounted for 47.13 \u00b1 10.44 % and ?? for 40.17 \u00b1 12.38 % at 665 nm. At 443 nm, the samples \n\nfrom the second fieldtrip were spread within the central zone of the ternary plot indicating that \n\nall three absorption coefficients co-varied somehow. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2. Ternary plots displaying the relative contribution of CDOM, phytoplankton and \n\ndetritus to the total absorption at different wavelengths, (a) 443 nm, (b) 560 nm, (c) 665 nm and \n\n(d) the relative contribution of water, particulate and CDOM to absorption at 709 nm. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n65 \n\nAs expected, the ternary plot showed the predominance of ?? at 665 nm to (????) from \n\nboth datasets with a slight dominance in the first field dataset. ?? dominated the absorption at \n\n560 nm and at 443 nm the absorption was mainly governed by ?? in the first and ????? in the \n\nsecond dataset. Since the QAA approach combines the absorption by CDOM and detritus, it \n\ncan be considered that IOPs data in Nav were dominated by ???? in the blue-green region and \n\n?? had a moderate contribution in the red region. The QAALv5 was developed using case-1 \n\nwaters where ?? at 440 nm was less than 0.3 m\n-1, while QAAM14, was developed using data \n\nfrom very turbid productive waters, where the average ?? (443) was 19.9 m\n-1 and 13.5 m-1, in \n\nJuly and April, respectively. According to Qin et al. (2007), the accuracy of QAA for ocean \n\nwaters generally degrades rapidly with increasing CDOM and non-algal particle (NAP) \n\nconcentrations. Li et al. (2016) used QAA with ?0 shifted to longer wavelengths and found that \n\nif the average contribution of ?????(443) dominates the absorption budget, then QAA can \n\nachieve better result in turbid inland waters, however, the higher contribution of ??(443) leads \n\nto the poorer prediction results. The datasets used in previous QAAs did not fit the bio-optical \n\nproperties of the current dataset with ?? (443) ranging between 0.72 \u2013 1.52 m\n-1, which called \n\nfor a re-parametrization. \n\n \n\n4.3.4 Performance of existing QAA \n\n \n\nThe first step was to test the performance of the existing QAAs: QAALv5, QAALv6, and \n\nQAAM14. We noticed that shifting the wavelength from 560 to 708 nm, the ?? (?) retrieval \n\nimproved (Figure 4.3). QAALv5 and QAALv6 consistently underestimated ?? at all wavelength, \n\nwhile QAAM14 showed some improvement, particularly at longer wavelengths. The \n\nunderestimation can be attributed to the inefficiency of the model at ?0 (560 and 665 nm, \n\nrespectively) and also due to the contribution of other OSCs such as suspended matter to the \n\nabsorption budget. The ternary plot (Figure 4.2d) showed that ?? contributed approximately \n\nwith 87 % to the absorption budget at 709 nm, which means that ?????, ?? and ?? together \n\ncontributed with 13 % to ??. QAAM14 showed more consistency when compared with measured \n\n??; however, since it was developed for a highly productive environment, the coefficients and \n\nband combinations were not suitable to describe the particularities of non-productive waters \n\nsuch as Nav. Therefore, the re-parametrization of the model was needed and initially based on \n\nQAAM14 using 709 nm as ?0 and then followed the steps proposed by QAALv5.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n66 \n\nFigure 4.3. Relationship between estimated and measured ?? (?) using existing QAAs: (a) \nQAALv5, (b) QAALv6 and (c) QAAM14. The colored circles represents the band centers of OLCI \n\nsensor. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3.5 Re-parametrization of QAA to derive ?? \n \n\nAs discussed in previous sections (Figure 4.3), ?0 plays a critical role in ?? retrieval and \n\nbands in NIR region should be considered for ?0 selection even in an oligo-to-mesotrophic \n\nenvironment with very low Chl-a and TSS concentrations. In Nav, both OSCs did not co-vary \n\namong themselves which is different from case-1 waters and that could be the reason why \n\nQAALv5 or QAALv6 did not perform satisfactorily. The set of steps described by Lee et al. (2002) \n\nto derive ?? is comprised of empirical, semi-analytical and analytical approaches and was also \n\nmodified to parametrize the current model. The absorption at 709 nm, ?? (709), was chosen as \n\n?0 to derive ? in the empirical model which combines four bands associated with the OSCs \n\ncontribution. To parametrize this variable, the relationship between ???? (709) and OLCI \n\nbands was verified and the best combination was chosen based on the coefficient of \n\ndetermination (R\u00b2) using bands at 443, 665 and 681 nm (R\u00b2 = 0.52, p &lt;0.001) (Equation 4.9). \n\n \n\n? = log10 (\n???443 + ???665\n\n???(?0) + (0.05 \u00d7\n???681\n\n2\n\n???443\n)\n\n) (4.9) \n\n \n\nThe band combination used to derive ? was same as Mishra et al. (2014). The band at \n\n443 nm was used to highlight the contribution of CDOM and despite being the spectral region \n\nof Chl-a absorption as well (GITELSON, 1992). According to Mishra et al. (2014) these bands \n\nreflects differential contribution of OSCs typically present in inland waters to the total \n\nabsorption budget, and therefore, the band combinations used in QAAM14 worked well for Nav. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n67 \n\nThe estimation of ?? is analytically related to ?? (?). Considering that ?? (?) is the sum of ??? \n\nand ??? and the value of ??? is already known, the spectral dependency of ???(?) is widely \n\nexpressed as Smith and Baker (1981) and Sathyendranath et al. (2001): \n\n \n\n???(?) = ???(?0) (\n?0\n?\n\n)\n?\n\n (4.10) \n\n?? (?) = ???(?) + ??? (?) (4.11) \n\n \n\nwhere ??? (?) is the pure water backscattering coefficient from Smith and Baker (1981), \n\n???(?0) is the particulate backscattering coefficient at the reference wavelength and can be \n\nestimated using Lee et al. (2002), ? is the spectral power factor for particulate backscattering \n\ncoefficient and can be empirically retrieved using ??? band ratio sensitive to phytoplankton and \n\nCDOM absorption (CARDER et al., 1999). To model ?, Lee et al. (2002) used an empirical \n\nband ratio between 440 and 550 nm, while Yang et al. (2013) used a semi-analytical model \n\nbased on bands 750 and 780 nm from MERIS. The former authors observed that shifting the ?0 \n\nto longer wavelengths is not enough to produce accurate IOPs, but improving ? retrieval is also \n\nsignificant. Thus, the calibration of ? was performed by comparing in situ ?? with derived ??. \n\nSeveral band combinations were tested and the best result was achieved with the ratio of 665 \n\nover 754 nm as shown below: \n\n \n\n? = 2 \u00d7 (1 ? 1.2 \u00d7 exp (?0.9 \u00d7\n???665\n\n???754\n)) (4.12) \n\n \n\nThe values of ? typically ranged from 0 to 2.2 and the higher values are associated \n\nmainly with oligotrophic waters (SATHYENDRANATH et al., 2001, LEE et al., 2002, \n\nZAWADA et al., 2007). ? ranged from 1.24 to 2.17 in Nav. Gordon and Morel (1983) \n\nconcluded that ? is higher when the backscattering is due to small particles and/or water. After \n\n?? retrieval, the derivation of ?? followed the equation that relates the ratio of ?? to the sum of \n\nabsorption and backscattering coefficients (?) as defined in Gordon et al. (1988) and expressed \n\nas: \n\n \n\n?? (?) =\n[1 ? ?(?)]?? (?)\n\n?(?)\n (4.13) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n68 \n\nAfter re-parametrization, the estimation accuracy of ?? improved significantly with a \n\nMAPE = 16.35% and RMSD = 0.15 m-1 (Figure 4.4a). The errors were considerably lower \n\ncompared to existing QAAs such as QAALv5 (MAPE = 58.05% and RMSD = 0.51 m\n-1), QAALv6 \n\n(MAPE = 35.59% and RMSD = 0.35 m-1), and QAAM14 (MAPE = 30.98% and RMSD = 0.31 \n\nm-1). The improvement was not consistent across all OLCI bands, particularly at 620 nm, which \n\nexhibited the second highest error among all tested versions (Table 4.3). However, this may not \n\nbe a problem for oligo-to-mesotrophic waters where phycocyanin concentration is negligible. \n\nThis could be an issue for waters dominated by cyanobacteria such as highly productive inland \n\nlakes and ponds. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4.

As shown in Figure 4.5a, the distance between the red data symbol \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n69 \n\n(reference) on the x-axis and each colored model symbol represents the uRMSD*. For the four \n\nmodels, the R was very different, ranging between 0.09 (QAAM14) to 0.63 (QAALv5). Among \n\nall tested models at 443 nm, QAALv5 produced the lowest ?\n? (0.26) which means that ?? (443) \n\nderived using the model was far from the reference (1.00 \u2013 0.26 = 0.74 units), and highest R \n\n(0.63) in comparison with the reference. As stated in Jolliff et al. (2009), for an R value of 0.63, \n\nthe minimum uRMSD* should occur where ?? = 0.63, however, if the goal is to move R and ?? \n\ncloser to an ideal value of 1.0, then uRMSD* is not a suitable validation metric. If we want to \n\nreduce the variability of both measured and estimated values, then ?? &lt;1.0, thus, QAALv5 \n\npresented the best performance, however, if we intend to bring the model patterns to the ideal \n\nvalue of the reference, then QAAOMR presented the best combination of R and ?\n? (R = 0.54, ?? \n\n= 0.96) as compared to the reference. In order to support the choice of the model, the target \n\nfunction was also used. At 443 nm (Figure 4.5b), QAAOMR was the only model which showed \n\nthe lowest B* (-1.07) and all of them underestimated the variance of ?? (443). QAALv5 retrieved \n\nthe highest B* (-5.43) emphasizing the bad performance of this model when compared to \n\nQAAOMR. The other models did not appear because they presented B* out of the range bounded \n\nby the interval of -3 and 3. Models positioned at the positive side of uRMSD* means that ???? >\n\n?????.  \n\nAt 560 nm (Figure 4.5c), QAALv5 was the only model that produced R > 0.50 and ?\n? = \n\n0.14, therefore the uRMSD* was minimum relative to other studied models, however, B* \n\nachieved again the highest value (-4.47) showing the underestimation pattern of this approach \n\nin retrieving ?? (560). Both QAALv6 and QAAM14 also underestimated ?? (560). QAAOMR \n\nproduced high value for ?? (2.12) and low value for R (0.03) showing the high variability \n\nbetween measured and estimated values, however, B* was the lowest (0.84) compared to other \n\nmodels (Figure 4.5d). Models not displayed in the Target graphic presented values outside the \n\nestablished range. Figure 4.5e showed that QAAOMR was the only model that retrieved at least \n\none error metric close to the reference (?? = 1.34) at 665 nm. According to Figure 4.5f, QAAOMR \n\noverestimated ?? (665) while QAAM14 (B* = -1,32) showed underestimation as well as QAALv5 \n\n(B* = -7.10) and QAALv6 (B* = -3.18). Overall, the error analysis showed a significant \n\nimprovement by the newly re-parametrized model mainly in the shorter and longer wavelengths \n\n(Table 4.3). The Taylor diagrams showed that the variability of ?? (?) estimated by the QAALv5 \n\nshowed a closer variation of the reference data, however, the underestimation was reasonably \n\nhigh becoming unviable its use for ?? (?) retrieval. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n70 \n\nFigure 4.5. Taylor diagrams for ?? (?) at (a) 443 nm, (c) 560 nm, (e) 665 nm. Target diagrams \nfor ??

The black circle in the Target diagrams (M0) corresponds to a \n\nnormalized total RMSD of 1.0, so all points between this circle and the origin are positively \n\ncorrelated. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3.6 Re-parametrization of QAA to derive ???? \n \n\nThe re-parametrization involved improvements to derive CDM spectral slope (????) \n\nand the parameters ? and ?. ? is related to Chl-a concentration or pigment absorption at a \n\nspecific wavelength, but according to Lee et al. (2002), due to the lack of absolute \n\nmeasurements, ? was empirically estimated using a blue-to-green band ratio of ???(440)/\n\n???(555) and successfully applied in case-1 waters (GORDON and MOREL, 1983, LEE et al. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n71 \n\n1998). However, at this spectral region, the organic and inorganic suspended matters also affect \n\nthe absorption budget (DOERFFER, 1994, CARDER et al., 1999). Yang et al. (2013) used \n\nanother approach to estimate ?? (443) independently of ? and ? with an assumption that the \n\napplicability of these empirical estimations was unclear for turbid waters. On the contrary, \n\nMishra et al. (2014) maintained the original band ratio, but the coefficients used in ?estimation \n\nwere changed. A new band ratio was proposed in this study by taking into account the local \n\ninformation and as recommended by Lee et al. (2002), this procedure is needed to improve the \n\nsplit-up of pigment and CDOM absorption fractions. After recalibration, the suitable band ratio \n\nbetween 443 and 709 nm (???(443)/???(709)) was applied to Nav dataset. Besides, the offset \n\ncoefficient was also recalibrated by testing values ranging between 0.5 \u2013 0.74 and followed the \n\nform: \n\n \n\n? = 0.5 + (\n0.2\n\n0.8 + ???443 ????0?\n) (4.14) \n\n \n\n? approximated using a ratio, ????(410)/???? (440), and ???? is associated with the \n\nwater composition such as pigment, dissolved organic and detritus (CARDER et., 1989, \n\nCARDER et al., 1991, SHANMUGAM et al., 2011). In the Nav dataset, the spectral slope \n\nvaried from 0.010 to 0.012 nm-1, therefore, the original offset value from Mishra et al. (2014) \n\nwas replaced with 0.0095 after a simple optimization using the in situ range. The new \n\ncalibration for ? is give below: \n\n \n\n???? = 0.0095 + (\n0.002\n\n0.6 + (???490 ????0? )\n) (4.15) \n\n? = exp[? \u00d7 (443 ? 412)] (4.16) \n\n \n\nThe remaining steps proposed by Mishra et al. (2014) were used to derive ???? in the \n\ncurrent model (Figure 4.4b). The average errors showed great improvement mainly at shorter \n\nwavelengths when compared to the previous versions (Table 4.4). The agreement between \n\nmeasured and estimated values showed an average MAPE of 18.87 % and the bands at 681 and \n\n709 nm had the highest errors, 24.18 and 30.66 % respectively. Mishra et al. (2014) observed a \n\nsimilar trend of high error at longer wavelengths starting from 560 nm and highlighted that the \n\nmagnitude of ???? at this region is small and therefore does not affect the overall performance \n\nto a large extent. Besides, the main spectral region associated to ????? is situated in the blue \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n72 \n\nregion. For instance, at 440 nm, ????? is considered a proxy of its concentration and used in \n\nremote sensing inversion (LEE and HU, 2006, ZHU et al., 2011). ???? using QAAOMR \n\nproduced the least error at blue wavelengths, specifically at 443 nm.  \n\n \n\nTable 4.4.

(0.21 and 0.31, \n\nrespectively) and R very close to these values (0.28 and 0.34, respectively) which means that \n\nuRMSD* was minimum in those models. On the other hand, QAAOMR showed a ?\n? = 1.16 and \n\nR = 0.54, which is closer to the reference value when compared to other models. The difference \n\nfrom all the models can be distinguished in the Target diagram (Figure 4.6b), and QAAOMR is \n\nthe only model displayed with B* = -0.12, depicting the underestimation of ???? (443), while \n\nthe other models presented B* between -6.28 and-5.73. The green data symbol is close to the \n\nblack circle indicating a uRMSD* close to 1. Figure 4.6c, showed again the good performance \n\nof QAAOMR in retrieving ???? (560). Overall the result was just like the previous one but now \n\nthe parametrized model presented a B* = 0.59, highlighting the overestimation pattern (Figure \n\n4.6d). At 665 nm, the QAAOMR again showed better combination of ?\n?, R and B* (Figure 4.6e, \n\nf).

In order to find the suitable spectrum \n\nof ??\n+(?), the calibrated dataset was used in Equations 4.19 and 4.20. \n\n \n\n??(?) = ?? (443) \u00d7 ??\n+(?) (4.18) \n\n??\n+(?) =\n\n??(?)?\n\n???\n (4.19) \n\n??? =\n? ?? (?)? ??\n\n???? ? ????\n (4.20) \n\n \n\nwhere, ?? (?)? is the spectral absorption of phytoplankton, ??? is spectrally averaged absorption \n\ncoefficient of phytoplankton (350 \u2013 800 nm), ???? and ???? are the maximum and minimum \n\nwavelengths. The numerator component of Eq. 4.21 was derived based on the area under the \n\ncurve notion (AUC) and then divided by the spectral difference (???? ? ????). Then, the in \n\nsitu ?? (?)? was divided by the latter component. A representative spectrum from Eq. 4.20 was \n\nchosen by statistic metrics (average, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and median) and \n\nfor Nav\u2019s dataset, the minimum spectrum was suitable to represent the ??\n+(?). The Eq. 4.18 is \n\nused in order to remove the effect of concentration and permits the estimation of variance due \n\nuniquely to spectral shape (ROESLER et al., 1989). \n\nAs result (Figure 4.4c, Table 4.5), the agreement between measured and estimated \n\n?? (?) from the re-parametrized model produced the lowest average values of MAPE = 46.80 \n\n% and RMSD = 0.10 m-1. The band specific contribution showed that other models performed \n\nslightly better in the blue regions compared to QAAOMR. For instance, QAALv6 produced the \n\nleast errors in 412 and 443 nm; similarly, QAAM14 had a MAPE of 42.84% at 681nm. However, \n\nQAAOMR showed consistent low errors across all OLCI bands without a spike in errors in a \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n75 \n\nspecific band unlike other QAAs. In addition, QAAOMR produced the least errors at 620, 665 \n\nand 709 nm with MAPE ranging between 45.56 \u2013 53.29 %. \n\n \n\nTable 4.5.

Figure 4.7b, showed that QAAM14 overestimated ?? and also produced high \n\nuRMSD* (1.92) followed by QAAOMR (2.13). To produce the best match between measured \n\nand estimated values requires a combination of low uRMSD* and B*, thus at 443 nm QAALv6 \n\nprovided the best fit for ?? followed by QAALv5 and QAAOMR. At 560 nm, QAALv5 and \n\nQAAOMR presented the lowest ?* (0.14 and 0.76, respectively) while the R was 0.40 and -0.31, \n\nrespectively (Figure 4.7c). Again, only QAALv5 and QAAOMR produced low uRMSD* and B*, \n\nbut the first one was slightly better than the latter one (Figure 4.7d). Even producing the lowest \n\nvariability between reference and modeled data, QAALv6 overestimated the variance of \n\n?? (665) becoming not a good approach. On the other hand, QAAOMR, presented the lowest B* \n\n(-0.246) showing to be the best approach from all the ones evaluated (Figure 4.7e, f). As \n\nmentioned in the previous section, the band specific errors varied widely between models.  \n\nThe modifications improved ?? (?) retrieval for an average error (MAPE) of ~47%. The \n\ndifficulty in retrieving ?? (?) was probably due to the very low Chl-a concentration combined \n\nwith the dominance of ?? in the blue and green regions followed by ????? dominating ?? at \n\n412 nm. Lee et al. (2010) also highlighted the great effort to estimate ?? (?) in complex waters. \n\nThe authors, observed that uncertainties associated to ???? (?) is smaller than that of ?? (?) \n\nand therefore methods other than simple algebraic inversions are required to improve the quality \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n76 \n\nof ?? (?) derivation. Besides, refinements are expected when parametrizations regarding \n\n?? (?0), ?, ? and ? for several regions are carried out. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.7. Taylor diagrams for ??

The results related to backscattering were not \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n77 \n\nassessed due to lack of data availability. The shorter wavelengths were highly affected by \n\ninorganic and dissolved matter (Figure 4.2). Intermediary steps, such as the tuning of ? and ? \n\nwere also relevant to achieve the best fit for ??. Lee et al. (2010) suggested that in order to get \n\nerror free ??, efforts must be taken to minimize the estimation error for ?? (?0) and ?.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.8. Validation result showing the scatter plot between measured and estimated (a) \n\n?? (?), (b) ???? (?), (c) ?? (?) and the comparison of spectral shape of average measured and \n\nestimated (d) ?? (?), (e) ???? (?) and (f) ?? (?). \n\n \n\n \n\nThe uncertainty based on average MAPE was above 50% for ?? between 490 \u2013 620 nm \n\nand the lowest errors were seen at 709 nm (0.45 \u2013 9.62%, n = 14), 681 nm (1.67 \u2013 27.17%, n = \n\n14), 665 nm (4.38 \u2013 43.13%, n = 14) and 412 nm (4.70 \u2013 73.62%, n = 14). Three specific \n\nsampling stations (P9, P13 and P19) were responsible for the increase in error above 50% and \n\nafter the removal of these samples, the average MAPE decreased below 50% at all OLCI \n\nwavelengths. These samples presented the lowest ?? values from all dataset considering all \n\nwavelengths suggesting that QAAOMR was not able to retrieve ?? in such magnitudes. However, \n\nthose samples were preserved to generate graphics in Figure 4.8. The ???? validation (Figure \n\n4.8c and d) showed a good fit mainly in longer wavelengths. The average MAPE was 52.15% \n\nand the highest error was seen at 490 nm (79.89%), 443 nm (78.30%), 412 nm (66.21%) and \n\n560 nm (58.89%). However, when the same three-outlier stations data were eliminated, the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n78 \n\naverage MAPE decreased to 45.11%. The accuracy of ???? (?) and ?? (?) is associated with \n\nthe uncertainties in ?? (?) and the parameters ? and ? (Lee et al. 2010). The reference \n\n????(443) was overestimated, possibly due to the mismatch between in situ and measured ? \n\nand ?. The estimation of ?? followed a hybrid method different from the native QAA in order \n\nto avoid negative prediction and maintain the shape, which can be difficult to achieve in waters \n\nwith very low Chl-a concentrations.  \n\nAlthough ?? prediction at some sampling locations were dispersed (Figure 4.8e), the \n\nmajority of them were centered on the 1:1 line and the average estimated spectrum matched \n\nwell with the in situ measurements. This step was dependent on the uncertainties associated \n\nwith ?? (?) and ? and ? parameters. High MAPE values (average 74.65%) were observed from \n\n412 to 681 nm and the highest errors were associated at longer wavelengths, mainly at 520, 620 \n\nand 665 nm. At least four stations (P2, P9, P13 and P19) contributed to this increased error. \n\nAfter excluding those samples, the average error decreased to 53.17%. It is worth mentioning \n\nthat in situ ?? (709) returned negative values using the protocol described in the Section \u201cData \n\nand Methods\u201d, for that reason, we disregarded data from this wavelength.  \n\nOverall, the QAAOMR improved the estimative of IOPs for Nav but the challenge \n\nremains focused on ?? retrieval. Ogashawara et al. (2016) also found low accuracy studying \n\nItumbiara reservoir (CDOM rich water) located in west center of Brazil, in the regions of 400 \n\n\u2013 500 nm and 500 \u2013 600 nm for ??. For ????, the uncertainties decreased but the errors were \n\nassociated to the intervals from 500 \u2013 600 nm and 600 \u2013 750 nm whereas for ?? the challenge \n\nwas to improve accuracy between 400 \u2013 500 nm and 500 \u2013 600 nm. These results imply that \n\ndifferent optical water quality environments can react differently with different QAA versions, \n\nhowever, the efforts accomplished up to now showed improvements in retrieving IOPs in oligo-\n\nto-mesotrophic water bodies. The authors also highlighted the need of additional tuning and \n\nvalidation exercises using broad geographic regions in order to increase IOP prediction. \n\n \n\n4.3.9 Linking IOPs variability to physical and meteorological variation \n\n \n\nIn situ ???(?) data corresponding to the third field trip was used to retrieve the IOPs \n\nbased on QAAOMR. ?? (443) data retrieved from QAAOMR regarding the first, second and third \n\nfield trips were averaged and then plotted on rainfall, runoff, water level and discharge graphics \n\n(Figure 4.9). Total rainfall during the months of April/2014, September/2014 and May/2016 \n\nwere 60.33 mm, 169.95 mm and 197.49 mm, respectively (Figure 4.9a). There was a growing \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n79 \n\ntrend from October/2013 to August/2016 and according to Coelho et al. (2015), the State of \n\nS\u00e3o Paulo experienced in 2014 and early 2015 a dramatic decline in rainfall rate with the \n\ninterval of Dec/2013 \u2013 Mar/2014 as the one of the driest summer of the 1961-2015 record. The \n\ndrought conditions affected the water availability for agriculture, hydropower generation and \n\npublic use during the austral summer (December \u2013 March). Extreme events such as droughts \n\ncan affect the water supply and because of that, public strategies are needed to avoid water \n\nquality decrease (KHAN et al., 2015). Besides, Cairo et al. (2016) reported the influence of the \n\natypical dry year of 2014 in water quality. They noticed that Ibitinga reservoir, also displayed \n\nalong the Tiet\u00ea river cascade system, worked as an accumulator of organic matter due to the \n\ndecrease of precipitation rate and increase of retention time. The water quality composition is \n\nhighly affected by the rainy and dry seasons and the rising of nutrient loads as well as the \n\nworsening of water transparency can be due to allochthonous sources that are maximized during \n\nthe rainy season as result of surface Runoff (SOARES and MOZETO, 2006; CUNHA et al., \n\n2016). Regarding the ?? (443) values, we can notice the growing trend from the first to the third \n\nfield trips as result of rainy conditions that increased from April to September of 2014 and then \n\nin May/2016. \n\nThe runoff (Figure 4.9b) corroborated to the rainfall data, which means that in \n\nApril/2014, the external contribution due to land water toward the reservoir was lower \n\ncompared to September/2014 and May/2016. Nonpoint pollutants attributable to agricultural \n\nactivities can be carried across the land surface by runoff and reach the reservoir, increasing the \n\nloads of nutrients leading to water quality degradation (RITTER and SHIRMOHAMMADI, \n\n2000). As displayed in Table 4.1, the water quality parameters got worse from the first to the \n\nsecond field trip, showing high concentrations of TSS and Chl-a and decrease of water visibility \n\ndue to increased turbidity. Smith et al. (2014) and Rodgher et al. (2005) found an increase of \n\ntotal phosphorus, nitrite and suspended materials during rainy season from upstream to \n\ndownstream in Tiet\u00ea River. The increase of nitrite and total phosphorus was related to soil \n\nfertilization. Numerous studies have reported similar phenomena of increased nutrient load \n\ncaused by stream inputs and surface runoff (VAROL et al., 2012; PERBICHE-NEVES et al., \n\n2011; HENRY et al., 1999). As in the rainfall graphic, ?? (443) also increased with increasing \n\nrunoff emphasizing the growing trend from 2014 to 2016. This means that, inputs from the \n\nwatershed contribute to the increase of absorbing components, such as dissolved and particulate \n\nmatter. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n80 \n\nFigure 4.9. Graphic depicting the (a) rainfall, (b) runoff, (c) water level and (d) discharge \n\nvariability along the period between October 2013 and August 2016. The green diamonds \n\nrepresent ?? (443) retrieved based on QAAOMR from the three field trips carried out in Nav \nduring April/2014, September/2014 and May/2016. Rainfall data was acquired in NASA\u2019s \n\nGIOVANNI database based on TRMM data with 0.25\u00b0 of spatial resolution \n\n(http://giovanni.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/giovanni/). Runoff data was also acquired through NASA\u2019s \n\nGIOVANNI database. Water level as well as discharge were downloaded from the Water \n\nNational Agency of Brazil through the website (http://sar.ana.gov.br/). \n\n \n\n \n\nRegarding the water level of Nav reservoir (Figure 4.9c), the annual average in 2014 \n\nwas 357.18 \u00b1 0.15 m followed by 357.56 \u00b1 0.23 m in 2015 and from January to August of 2016 \n\nthe average was 357.70 \u00b1 0.20 m showing low variability but a growing trend from 2014 to \n\n2016. The low water level variance is because Nav is a run-of-river reservoir and therefore, \n\nthere is no water storage. In addition, this kind of operation system presents short water \n\nretention time (WRT) and the shape is in general simpler and shallower (PERBICHE-NEVES \n\nand NOGUEIRA, 2013). The maximum water discharge (Figure 4.9d) occurred in January, \n\nMarch and June of 2016 and was in accordance with the rainfall pattern. Along the years of \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n81 \n\n2014 and 2015, the discharge virtually remained stagnant showing signs of recovery in 2016 as \n\npresented by the trend line. This was probably related to the extreme events of droughts in those \n\ntwo specific years. The discharge is indirectly related to WRT, which means that high discharge \n\ndemands short WRT and according to Soares et al. (2008), this feature affected the longitudinal \n\nstratification period in a reservoir in Southern Brazil, while Straskraba and Tundisi (1999) \n\ndiscussed the impact of WRT on the vertical stability of reservoirs. Jones and Elliott (2007) \n\nobserved a high phytoplankton biomass and longer algal blooms by increasing the WRT. \n\n \n\n4.3.10 Factors influencing optical changes in the reservoir \n\n \n\nLand use and land cover (LULC) can affect the water quality composition by supplying \n\nparticulate and dissolved matter leading to the modification of optical properties. Land uses \n\nsuch as urban land cover and agriculture can be associated with suspended solids (MOURI et \n\nal., 2011; CUNHA et al., 2016). In S\u00e3o Paulo State, erosion processes contribute with soil loss \n\nin watersheds dominated by agriculture carrying to water sediments and terrestrial matter \n\n(MERTEN and MINELLA, 2013). Le et al. (2015) found that both land uses (urban + \n\nagriculture) play an important role in light attenuation in the estuaries as result of absorption by \n\nphytoplankton. The intensification of primary production can be motivated by the input of \n\nnutrients such as phosphorus increasing the ?? (443). Areas covered by forests can improve \n\nwater quality by reducing the erosion processes and sediment inputs (CUNHA et al., 2016).  \n\nIn Tiet\u00ea River, the most significant sources of pollution come from the metropolitan and \n\nindustrial region of S\u00e3o Paulo. However, the water quality improves from the upstream \n\nreservoirs to the downstream due to auto-depuration and sedimentation of suspended matter \n\nincreasing the dissolved oxygen and water clarity (BARBOSA et al., 1999). The LULC in Nav \n\nis basically composed by agriculture, especially sugarcane and pasture whereas other classes \n\nsuch as riparian forests are absent around the reservoir (PETESSE and PETRERE, 2012). These \n\nresults are in accordance with Figure 4.2, showing that detritus and CDOM control IOPs from \n\nNav at 443 nm. These imply that both OSCs are dominant in the reservoir and can be linked to \n\nwatershed activities. The region is also comprised by high content of sand and low levels of \n\nultisol (EMBRAPA, 1999). \n\nAccording to Figures 4.10a and 4.10d, when ?? (443) is analyzed based on overall \n\ndataset the correlation with TSS and Chl-a was very high (r = 0.80 and r = 0.79, p &lt;0.001, \n\nrespectively). However, when ?? (443) is based on individual campaigns, the correlation with \n\nTSS drops and only data from Nav 2 showed to be statistically significant (r = 0.54, p &lt;0.05) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n82 \n\nwhereas the correlation between ?? (443) and Chl-a was nonsignificant (p > 0.05) considering \n\ncampaigns individually. The ???? (443) overall dataset (Figure 4.10b, e) presented a \n\ncorrelation of 0.66 (p &lt;0.001) with both TSS and Chl-a, on the other hand, the individual \n\ncampaigns did not present any statistical correlation between ???? (443), TSS and Chl-a. \n\nRegarding the overall data, the correlation between TSS and Chl-a (Figure 4.10c) was 0.88 (p \n\n&lt;0.001) although, from all campaigns only Nav 2 and Nav 3 were statistically significant (r = \n\n0.62 and 0.80, respectively, p &lt;0.05). The relationship between ?? (443) and Chl-a (Figure \n\n4.10f) was weak but significant (r = 0.51, p &lt;0.001). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.10. Relationship between optical properties and water quality parameters: (a) ?? (443) \nversus TSS; (b) ???? (443) versus TSS; (c) ?? (443) versus TSS; (d) ?? (443) versus Chl-a; \n\n(e) ???? (443) versus Chl-a and (f) ?? (443) versus Chl-a. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe results revealed that the poor correlation between TSS and Chl-a in Nav 1 (r = 0.35, \n\np > 0.05) indicates that Chl-a was not the only parameter controlling the water optical properties \n\nthus assuming a typical case 2 water (MOREL and PRIEUR, 1977). Besides, the weak or \n\nnoncorrelation allied with the low Chl-a concentration suggested the both TSS and CDOM \n\nwere mainly originated from allochthonous sources or even sediment resuspension but not from \n\nthe degradation product of phytoplankton. Wu et al. (2011) who studied an inorganic matter \n\ndominated lake (Poyang, China) found the same observation. The low agreement between \n\n?? (443) and Chl-a corroborated with previous results and together with ???\n?1(?), presented in \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n83 \n\nFigure 2, we can notice the inexistence of a pronounced absorption valley at 443 nm, that is \n\ntypical of phytoplankton dominated waters (YANG et al., 2013, MISHRA et al., 2014). \n\n \n\n4.3.11 Implications of QAAOMR for water resource management \n\n \n\nNowadays, water quality monitoring along the set of reservoirs of Tiet\u00ea River has been \n\ncarried out using traditional techniques with high cost and low temporal and spatial variability. \n\nThe implication of this can be followed by the lack of information about the sources of water \n\ncontamination and possibility to perform cross analysis with other variables such as LULC data. \n\nUnderstanding the water constitution, we can also understand how to proceed in decision \n\nmaking avoiding high cost of in situ data collection granting accurate information. \n\nUp to now, the QAA is available with high accuracy for ocean and coastal waters (LEE \n\net al., 2002, ZHU et al., 2011, ORGANELLI et al., 2016) and was evaluated for inland waters \n\n(LE et al., 2009a, LI et al., 2016). Improvements were carried out in order to adequate QAA for \n\nvery turbid and productive waters (MISHRA et al., 2013, 2014, WATANABE et al., 2016a). \n\nHowever, in inland waters with low Chl-a and TSS concentrations, such as Nav, few works \n\nshowed improvements but still high uncertainties (LI et al., 2016, OGASHAWARA et al., \n\n2016). Our findings based upon in situ observations revealed that the enhancement of QAA \n\ncould estimate the IOPs with high accuracy showing the potential of this approach in back up \n\nthe water resource management in Tiet\u00ea River with extension to other oligo-to-mesotrophic \n\nenvironments.  \n\n \n\n4.4 Conclusion \n\n \n\nDespite the significant effort in retrieving the IOPs by QAA algorithm for open ocean, \n\ncoastal and very productive waters, applications focused on non-productive inland waters and \n\ninorganic matter dominated remains a challenge. In this study, three well-known QAAs were \n\napplied and their performance was compared in an oligo-to-mesotrophic reservoir in Southeast \n\nof Brazil. The QAALv5, QAALv6 and QAAM14 were developed to retrieve IOPs in open ocean, \n\ncoastal water and very productive inland waters, respectively. These models did not show a \n\ngood agreement between estimated and measured ?? (?), ???? (?) and ?? (?) and the main issue \n\nbehind this failure was first addressed to the reference wavelength selection, which is \n\nresponsible to highlight just the contribution of water in the total absorption budget.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n84 \n\nThe bad performance of previous QAAs motivated us to modify the existent code \n\nshifting the reference wavelength to 709 nm (available in both MSI/Sentinel-2 and \n\nOLCI/Sentinel-3) and then re-parametrize the ?? (?0) and ? in order to retrieve ?? (?) and ?? (?). \n\nThis step was of paramount relevance even considered by Lee et al. (2002) as a second order \n\nof importance, because all the further steps depend on ?? (?) to estimate ???? (?), and ?? (?). \n\nBesides, the properties ? and ? also considered of second order of importance, showed to be \n\nsignificant for retrieving ???? (?0), and ?? (?0). Specifically, the changes ran through \n\nmodification of band combination (443, 665, 709, 681 nm) designed to retrieve ? and further \n\nthe estimation of new coefficients for ?? (?0) retrieval. Also assigned as necessary, the \n\ndefinition of ? based on bands 665 and 754 nm increased the accuracy of ?? (?) measure.  \n\nThe main obstacle found on previous QAAs was related to ?? (?) retrieval based on \n\nsimple subtraction between ?? (?) and ???? (?), however, the errors was very high surpassing \n\n100% of uncertainties considering specific wavelengths. Therefore, we came up with a new \n\napproach recently suggested by Ogashawara et al. (2016) but with relevant modifications \n\naiming to derive ?? (443) based on Lee et al. (2010) and the normalized ??\n+(?) discussed by \n\nRoesler et al. (1989). As result, we achieved great improvement with uncertainties below 50% \n\n(412 \u2013 681 nm). Using an independent dataset, a validation exercise was carried out, and \n\nQAAOMR showed to be robust in retrieving the IOPs, and even assuring the necessity of use \n\ndata from broader geographic regions, the model comes to give a better solution for waters \n\ncharacterized as oligo-to-mesotrophic and dominated by inorganic matter. \n\nIn order to understand the IOPs variability in Nav, a discussion based on physical and \n\nmeteorological data was presented. Data of LULC can be the key of trophic state definition and \n\nthe source of suspended matter as well as CDOM may be associated to agriculture activities. \n\nThe allochthonous components integrate the aquatic system through rainfall and surface runoff. \n\nThe low contribution of Chl-a in suspended matter was related to the weak relationship between \n\nChl-a and TSS and between ?? (443) and Chl-a. Validation using different locations is \n\nencouraged in order to assess the feasibility of the new parametrized coefficients. In general, \n\nthe model brought a new perspective to water quality monitoring based on oligo-to-mesotrophic \n\nenvironments such as in tropical reservoirs and also, the scale-up of QAAOMR to OLCI sensor \n\nis the next step in retrieving the IOPs once this sensor provides strategic and useful bands related \n\nto remote sensing of water supporting the water resource management. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n85 \n\nCHAPTER 5: EVALUATION OF QAAOMR AND QAABBHR PERFORMANCES IN \n\nDERIVING THE IOPS IN BOTH BB AND NAV RESERVOIRS \n\n \n\n5.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nThe reservoirs of Tiet\u00ea River set in a cascade system present trophic states ranging from \n\noligo to hypereutrophic, which means that a single method for water resource monitoring using \n\nremote sensing technique will demand for a robust approach. The QAA for example, is a \n\nvaluable method for retrieving the IOP and further applied in semi-analytical approaches for \n\nestimating the water quality (MOREL and GORDON, 1980), however, studies revealed that \n\nempirical calibration steps are required for different locations (LEE et al., 2002; LE et al., \n\n2009a; YANG et al., 2013; MISHRA et al., 2014, LI et al., 2016, WATANABE et al., 2016a, \n\nOGASHAWARA et al., 2016). Li et al. (2016), for instance, applied the QAAv5 from Lee et al. \n\n(2009) and compared to a modified version of the same approach in various highly turbid waters \n\nin China, and they observed the necessary of an optimized algorithm to derive the IOPs in \n\nextremely turbid waters. \n\nThe limitation of QAAv5 in retrieving the absorption coefficients in turbid inland waters \n\nwas described by Yang et al. (2013). They listed three limiting issues, such as: the estimation \n\nof the total absorption coefficient at a reference wavelength, ?(?0), based on synthetic data. \n\nSecondly, the spectral power for particle backscattering coefficient, ?, was calibrated \n\nconsidering the data from open oceans or coastal waters. The last issue regards the use of \n\nsynthetic data for estimating the phytoplankton absorption. Those steps, were listed by Lee et \n\nal. (2002) as second order of importance because they have a narrow range of variation and \n\nsmall influence on the output, however, the authors also mentioned that even classified as \n\nsecond order of importance, they affect the final product and therefore, improvements must be \n\ncarried out considering regional and seasonal information, or using better algorithms (LEE et \n\nal., 2010). \n\nLe et al. (2009a) for example, changed the reference wavelength to 710 nm in the highly \n\nturbid water of Taihu Lake and to 780 nm during summer where the water showed to be \n\nextremely turbid due to the increase of phytoplankton concentration. Besides, they also changed \n\nthe band ratio used in ? retrieval. Yang et al. (2013) shifted the ?0 to longer wavelengths (753 \n\nnm), replace the empirical model for estimating ? for a semi-analytical approach and developed \n\na novel way to retrieve ?? at 443 nm. Mishra et al. (2014) changed the ?0 to 708 nm and \n\nincluded the band at 620 nm into the empirical step for ?(?0) retrieval. This procedure was due \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n86 \n\nto the presence of cyanobacteria in the study area. Watanabe et al. (2016) also included the band \n\nat 620 nm due to the same reason as previous study. They changed the band combination for ? \n\nretrieval using the ratio ?? (665)/?? (709) and altered the ????? slope based on in situ data. \n\nThe non-modification of the ????? slope was pointed out as the main cause for the failure of \n\nthe QAA (LEE et al., 2002) in breaking down the ?(?) into CDOM and phytoplankton \n\nabsorption coefficients in Australian coastal waters (QIN et al., 2007). Ogashawara et al. (2016) \n\nre-parameterized the QAA for inland waters dominated by CDOM. For this, they used ?0(560) \n\ninstead of 709 nm and kept the exponent values from Lee et al. (2009) to estimate ?(?0). A \n\nfactor to attest the influence of CDOM was computed to derive ?(?) and a drastic modification \n\nwas carried out in ?? (?), by mixing both approaches from Lee et al. (2010) and Roesler et al. \n\n(1989). \n\nIn this manner, improvements in empirical steps are highly recommended for different \n\ntypes of water, however in terms of operational system for water management in a cascade \n\nsystem, where the bio-optical properties vary from upstream to downstream, multiple \n\napproaches can be time consuming and unfeasible. Therefore, aiming to assess the performance \n\nof a single QAA version to assist the water quality management in Tiet\u00ea River, the versions \n\nfrom Watanabe et al. (2016a) parameterized to BB and the QAAOMR parametrized to Nav were \n\nused and then evaluated to highlight the improvements and fragility from each version \n\nsupposing to choose a single approach for future use considering the entire cascade system. \n\n \n\n5.2 Data and Methods \n\n \n\nFor this purpose, the dataset from the first and second field trips of BB were applied \n\nsumming 40 samples while for Nav, data from the three field campaigns were used totalizing \n\n51 samples. The QAA versions from Watanabe et al. (2016a) and the one presented in Chapter \n\n4 were evaluated. In situ measures of the IOPs and here represented by the absorption \n\ncoefficients of phytoplankton, ??, NAP, ????, and CDOM, ????? were compared to the \n\nestimated values retrieved by the specific QAA version. The combination of ????? and ???? \n\nproduced the ????, one of the QAA products. To obtain the in situ absorption coefficient of \n\nparticulate, ??, and the respective organic (??) and inorganic fraction (????), methods from \n\nTassan and Ferrari (1995, 2002) were applied, while for ?????, the method from Tilstone et al. \n\n(2002) was used. \n\nThe in situ ??? data were estimated following the procedure suggested by Mobley \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n87 \n\n(1999). For this, hyperspectral measures were acquired from the use of the RAMSES TriOS\u00ae \n\n(TriOS, Germany). The in situ ??? were then convolved to the spectral response functions of \n\nthe Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI/Sentinel-3 satellite) spectral response \n\n(PELLOQUIN and NIEKE, 2012) to derive the band-weighted reflectance data (GORDON, \n\n1995). The simulated ??? from Nav were then used in the QAAABBHR and the ones from BB \n\nwere used for QAAOMR. The steps from each version can be found in Table 5.1. \n\n \n\nTable 5.1 QAA steps comparing the QAABBHR from Watanabe et al.

(?) retrieval (Figure 5.1a) \n\nwith average MAPE of 23.02% (Table 5.1), below the one found by Watanabe et al. (2016a) \n\nfor parametrization of the current model registering an average of 28.27% using BB dataset. \n\nThe algorithm exhibited limitation in estimating ?? (?) at 412 and 560 nm in Nav, whilst the \n\nbest result was observed at 665, 681 and 709 nm, with uncertainties ranging between 5.36 and \n\n13.50%. For QAABBHR parametrization, the authors found that the best result was observed at \n\n681 nm, that is associated with Chl-a fluorescence, and here the best result was achieved at 709 \n\nnm (MAPE = 5.36%), differently from Watanabe\u2019s result, who found the worst fit at this \n\nwavelength. Is worth pointing out that 709 nm was chosen as the reference wavelength for \n\nQAABBHR due to the dominance of pure water in the absorption budget at this wavelength, so \n\nthe interference of other OSCs than pure water is supposed to be minimal. On the other hand, \n\nthe worst performance at shorter wavelengths might be related also to the in-water constituents, \n\nthat is, in Nav, at 412 and 443 nm the influence of phytoplankton is almost inexistent when \n\ncompared to NAP and CDOM absorption. In general, the model underestimated ?? (?) with \n\naverage of -0.05. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n89 \n\nFigure 5.1. Scatter plots in log-scale between measured and estimated ?? (?), ???? (?) and \n?? (?) at OLCI spectral bands. \n\n \n\n \n\nA decline of the result of QAABBHR for ???? (?) was observed for Nav (Figure 5.1b) \n\nwith average MAPE of 59.40% (Table 5.1). Watanabe et al. (2016a) found an average of \n\n47.41% and the best result was observed at the red spectral region when they considered the \n\nnormalized root mean square error (NRMSE) as uncertainty, however, considering the MAPE, \n\nthe red region presented the worst result while at shorter wavelengths, the MAPE was lower. \n\nIn Nav\u2019s dataset, the result followed the same trend with MAPE above 50% in the green to NIR \n\nwavelengths (58.52 \u2013 86.41%). Mishra et al. (2014) observed a similar trend of high error at \n\nlonger wavelengths starting from 560 nm and emphasized that the magnitude of ???? at this \n\nregion is small and therefore does not affect the overall performance to a large extent. In \n\naddition, is worth noting that the main spectral region associated to ????? is placed in the blue \n\nregion (443 nm as a proxy for CDOM concentration) (Lee and Hu 2006). Thus, the error related \n\nto this wavelength was 34.13%, with bias of -0.24 m-1 showing inclination for underestimation \n\nand the RMSD of 0.43 m-1 was below the average in situ ???? (443) of 0.72 m\n-1. \n\n \n\nTable 5.2.

(?) retrieval for non-productive inland waters are still a challenge since now few \n\ninitiatives has been developed to address this issue. Recently, Ogashawara et a. (2016) re-\n\nparameterized a QAA for CDOM dominated waters and improved the errors of ?? (?) for \n\nreasonable levels (NRMSE = 25.90% for Funil reservoir and 29.76% for Itumbiara reservoir). \n\nTheir approach used an algorithm built to return the spectral features of phytoplankton (Lee et \n\nal. 2010) and they also introduced a factor to correct the effect of CDOM in the water column. \n\nOn the other hand, QAABBHR used the same approach of Lee et al. (2002) who estimated ?? (?) \n\nfrom the subtraction of ?? (?), ???? (?) and ?? (?) and as result they found an average MAPE \n\nof 78.08%, highlighting the limitation of the algorithm in retrieving ?? (?) in BB, however, this \n\noutcome was better than the previous versions of QAA related to ocean and productive inland \n\nwaters (LE et al., 2009a, YANG et al., 2013, MISHRA et al., 2014). The QAABBHR retrieved \n\nthe lowest error for ?? at 443 and 412 nm, with MAPE of 38.42% and 61.85% respectively, as \n\nalso observed by Watanabe et al. (2016) who found a MAPE of 32.8% for 443 nm. The success \n\nof ?? (?) depends on the estimation of ?? (?) and ???? (?), so in the case of Nav, the low result \n\nfor ???? (?) above 50% of average error led to the increase of ?? error. Another issue that \n\nmight be addressed is the shape of ?? (Figure 5.2), which is not matching with the in situ data \n\nacquired in laboratory. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2. Spectral shape acquired through (a) QAABBHR and (b) Nav in situ ?? acquired from \n\nlaboratory analysis. The continuous red line stands for the average spectral ?? from Nav in situ \n\ndata. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n91 \n\n5.4.2 Use of QAAOMR in BB\u2019s dataset \n\n \n\nNow, analyzing the QAAOMR applied to BB dataset we also observed a good matching \n\nbetween retrieved ?? (?) and in situ measurements (Figure 5.3a). The average MAPE was \n\n38.04% and the higher errors were between 443 to 560 nm (41.34 \u2013 47.25%, Table 5.2). For \n\nQAAOMR re-parametrization, the average error was 16.35% using Nav\u2019s dataset, thus we can \n\nsee that there was a decline in the ?? (?) performance using data from BB. On the other hand, \n\nan improvement was observed at 620 nm showing the second lowest error (30.18%) whilst the \n\nopposite was described in QAAOMR parametrization, since at this wavelength the error was \n\nconsidered the highest one with 29.05%. The error at 709 nm retrieved the lowest error \n\n(28.80%) and the average bias showed an underestimation trend (-0.14 m-1). \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3. Scatter plots in log-scale between measured and estimated ?? (?), ???? (?) and \n?? (?) at OLCI spectral bands. \n\n \n \n\nThe ???? (?) retrieval was not satisfactory since the error was above 50% reaching \n\n156.18% at 560 nm, meaning that QAAOMR was not able to retrieve this IOP accurately. This \n\nstep demanded for huge modifications in both QAAOMR and QAABBHR models, mainly \n\nregarding the band combinations used in empirical steps such as the calibration of ? and the \n\nslope of CDM (????). The first parameter is associated to Chl-a concentration or pigment \n\nabsorption at a specific wavelength and in QAAOMR the band combination was set at the ratio \n\nof 443 and 709 nm while QAABBHR used the band combination ratio between 665 and 709 nm. \n\nThe nature of both types of waters is totally divergent, BB is phytoplankton matter dominated \n\nwhile Nav is inorganic matter dominated with low Chl-a concentration, therefore, the \n\ncalibration of this step is mandatory in order to fit the model to the water characteristics. The \n\n???? describes the composition of pigment, dissolved organic matter and detritus (CARDER \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n92 \n\net al., 1989, SHANMUGAM et al., 2011) so it is also changeable and must be taken into \n\nconsideration during ???? (?) retrieval. \n\n \n\nTable 5.3.

(?) retrieval, a new approach was required to estimate this variable in non-\n\nproductive waters and the base of the model was established by both references Roesler et al. \n\n(1989) and Lee et al. (2010), also used by Ogashawara et al. (2016), however with considerable \n\ndifferences. The combination from both references was adopted in order to preserve the ?? \n\nshape messed up in the previous QAA versions. As result, the average MAPE found in the \n\noriginal QAAOMR was 46.80% with errors below 50% except for 709 nm. When the model was \n\napplied to BB dataset the average error was 112.17% (Figure 5.3c, Table 5.2) and even with \n\nthis magnitude of error, the shape of ?? (Figure 5.4) was preserved and retrieved only positive \n\nvalues, differently of previous versions. In general, the model was overestimated (bias = 0.48 \n\nm-1). The most useful bands used for Chl-a and phycocyanin concentration estimation (665 and \n\n709 nm) presented errors of 113.17 and 112.81%, respectively, indicating the limitation of this \n\nstep in retrieving accurately the ?? (?). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n93 \n\nFigure 5.4. Spectral shape acquired through (a) QAAOMR and (b) in situ ?? from BB acquired \n\nfrom laboratory analysis. The continuous red line stands for the average spectral ?? from BB \n\nin situ data. \n\n \n \n\n5.4. Conclusion \n\n \n\nThe results showed that ?? (?) retrieval was not the limiter step in the QAA approaches, \n\nreturning values with errors (MAPE) below 40%. On the contrary, the following stages \n\ndemanded for specific adjustments regarding the different water types. In case of Nav, the use \n\nof QAABBHR was successful for ???? (?) at wavelengths between 412 to 560 nm (MAPE &lt;\n\n50%) and at 443 nm the MAPE was 34.13% highlighting the good performance of the model \n\nfor this specific dataset and considering that at this wavelength we can also estimate the \n\ndissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration. However, the model was not able for deriving \n\n?? (?) specially at 560, 620 and 709 nm with errors exceeding 500%. In addition, another issue \n\nwas related to the inefficiency in modeling the ?? shape reflecting the limitation of the model.  \n\nIn case of BB, the QAAOMR increased the error for modeling ???? (?) reaching 100% \n\nin all wavelengths except for 412 and 709 nm (MAPE &lt;100%), this contretemps was attributed \n\nto the need of empirical step calibration, such as the adjustment of both ? and ???? according \n\nto the water type. As expected, the QAAOMR showed high errors (MAPE > 100%, except for \n\n620 nm that presented and error below 100%) for ??

Therefore, we can assume \n\nthat a single model can be suitable to estimate at least ?? (?) considering different trophic state \n\nwaters.

TSM induced turbidity has a \n\ndeleterious effect on light propagation through the water column affecting the primary \n\nproduction (SHEN et al., 2010), besides, it plays a crucial role in the transportation of nutrients \n\nand contaminants by adsorption (WU et al., 2013). The degradation of inland waters has been \n\nwidely discussed by the scientific community and is considered a public order issue \n\n(PANIGRAHI et al., 2009). The monitoring of the water quality via usual field techniques \n\ndemands efforts and high cost, besides a holistic panorama is difficult to achieve by applying \n\ncommon field techniques (SONG et al., 2012). Satellite images have been used in water quality \n\nmonitoring since 1978 with the availability of data from Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) \n\non board of NIMBUS 7 designed to provide ocean color data (EVANS and GORDON, 1994). \n\nSince then, many studies (MOORE et al., 1999; MILLER and MCKEE, 2004; SHEN et al., \n\n2010; TARRANT et al., 2010; MISHRA and MISHRA, 2010; WANG et al., 2012; SHI et al., \n\n2015; KUMAR et al., 2016) have been conducted in order to retrieve TSM concentration using \n\nthe next generation ocean color sensors such as Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor \n\n(SeaWiFS) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from the \n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Medium Resolution Imaging \n\nSpectrometer (MERIS) from the European Space Agency (ESA). \n\nThe high temporal and spectral resolution of MODIS (TERRA and AQUA) sensor has \n\nenabled the scientific community to develop numerous models over the years to retrieve TSM \n\nconcentrations. Miller and McKee (2004) demonstrated the utility of MODIS Terra band 1 (645 \n\nnm) surface reflectance data for estimating TSM concentration and studying the transport of \n\nmaterials in coastal environments. Wang et al. (2012) also found a robust linear relationship \n\nbetween MODIS band 1 and TSM concentration (R2 = 0.95, RMSE = 0.51 mg l-1) in Bohai Sea \n\nof China and highlighted the strong performance of this model for monitoring the transport of \n\nmaterials in small water bodies. Shi et al. (2015) obtained a reasonable correlation using an \n\nexponential calibration function between MODIS Aqua band 1 and TSM (R2 = 0.70, RMSE = \n\n14.3 mg l-1) for Lake Taihu (China), which is a turbid environment (TSM ranging from 15.8 to \n\n218.6 mg l-1). Kumar et al. (2016) re-parametrized three variants of Miller and McKee (2004) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n96 \n\nmodel using MODIS 250 m data and accurately retrieved TSM concentration between the range \n\nof 6.5 to 200 mg l-1 for the Asia\u2019s largest brackish water estuary, Chilika Lagoon. On the \n\ncontrary, Tarrant et al. (2010) found a weak relationship (R2 = 0.28) between MODIS band 1 \n\nand TSM in several southwestern United States (US) lakes (TSM ranging between 0.30 \u2013 20.0 \n\nmg l-1) and included band 2 (858 nm) which significantly enhanced the model performance (R2 \n\n= 0.82 and RMSE = 1.67 mg l-1). Wu et al. (2013) applied this band combination to estimate \n\nTSM concentration in Poyang Lake, China, and their model explained 76% of TSM variance.  \n\nOther empirical and semi-empirical models such as band ratios have also provided \n\nsuitable estimates of TSM. Tang et al. (2013) found that Rrs(560)/Rrs(490) presented a good \n\nrelationship for low TSM (R2 = 0.74) concentrations (&lt;3.0 mg l-1) and Rrs(681)/Rrs(560) worked \n\nwell for high TSM values (R2 = 0.80). Han et al. (2006) developed a model using bands at 550 \n\nnm and 670 nm for Yangtze River estuary where phytoplankton and yellow substances were \n\nthe main factors that control the water reflectance. These wavelengths are sensitive to \n\nsuspended sediment and their combination may reduce the effect of the chlorophyll (Chl-a). \n\nZhang et al. (2010) also developed a model that exploited these two spectral regions and they \n\nemphasized that the green and red bands are sensitive to TSM variations in waters with a wide \n\nrange of turbidity regime. \n\nAs previously mentioned, MODIS data is widely used to estimate TSM concentrations \n\nin inland waters with different limnological and environmental conditions, thus some aspects \n\nare already consolidated. The TSM spectral behavior is noticeable in the visible to near-infrared \n\n(NIR) wavelengths showing a strong correlation in the red wavelength (MILLER and MCKEE, \n\n2004; HAN et al., 2006; CUI et al., 2013; KUMAR et al., 2016). An increase in TSM \n\nconcentration shifts the reflectance peak towards longer wavelength in the visible spectrum \n\n(HAN et al., 2006). Odermatt et al. (2012) also observed that the reflectance peak position is \n\naffected by the TSM concentration and the band at 555 nm is appropriate to retrieve \n\nconcentrations below 30 mg l-1 (ELEVELD et al., 2008) and the band at 670 nm is more suitable \n\nfor higher concentrations (HAN et al., 2006). \n\nIn addition to the empirical models (MILLER and MCKEE, 2004, HAN et al., 2006), \n\nTSM can also be retrieved using semi-analytical or semi-empirical models that relate the \n\ninherent optical properties (IOPs) and the water constituents, combined with some empirical \n\nsteps (DEKKER et al., 2001; DOXARAN et al., 2002; CARDER et al., 2004; ZHANG et al., \n\n2010). To estimate the TSM concentration in Frisian lakes, Netherlands, Dekker et al. (2001) \n\nused analytical optical modelling based on in situ IOPs and satellite images. They highlighted \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n97 \n\nthe limitation of the model to estimate TSM > 40 mg l-1 due to saturation of the reflectance. \n\nDoxaran et al. (2002) developed an experimental method for determining TSM concentration \n\nin highly turbid waters (ranging between 35 \u2013 2,000 mg l-1) in Gironde estuary, France. They \n\nfound an accuracy of \u00b1 35% for concentrations up to 2000 mg l-1. Nechad et al. (2010) calibrated \n\nand validated a generic algorithm for TSM retrieval in turbid waters, which was developed to \n\nbe applied to any ocean color sensor such as MODIS, MERIS and SeaWiFS. The relative error \n\nfor calibration was less than 30% in the spectral range 670 \u2013 750 nm and for validation; the \n\nerror was less than 40%. The semi-analytical models may show a performance advantage over \n\nempirical models, however, they need many in situ measurements, such as absorption (a) and \n\nbackscattering (bb) coefficients, remote sensing reflectance (Rrs), TSM, Chl-a, CDOM and so \n\nforth, which makes the practical application difficult (WANG et al., 2012). On the other hand, \n\nempirical models do not need IOPs thus could be readily applicable and operational.  \n\nCurrent monitoring and water quality management protocol in Nova Avanhandava \n\n(Nav) and Barra Bonita (BB) reservoirs situated in Southeast of Brazil, is primarily based on in \n\nsitu collections, which can be very expensive and time consuming. It leads to a scarcity of dense \n\ntemporal water quality data necessary to track the trend in water quality for effective \n\nmanagement actions. Both reservoirs belong to the cascade system of Tiet\u00ea River consisting of \n\nsix reservoirs. In addition, due to the long extension of Tiet\u00ea River that crosses the State of S\u00e3o \n\nPaulo from East to West (1.150 km) under many different land use and land cover (LULC) \n\nsettings, it is extremely challenging to monitor the water quality from these reservoirs via \n\ntraditional methods. Therefore, the use of remote sensing based approach is of topmost \n\nimportance allowing frequent spatio-temporal monitoring with very low cost. According to \n\nSmith et al. (2014), the water quality is highly affected by this cascade setting leading to intense \n\neutrophication in the first reservoir (BB) followed by a gradual change in trophic status from \n\nmeso-oligotrophic waters.  \n\nSeveral studies have shown that many empirical and semi-empirical models perform \n\nsatisfactorily in a single or few similar turbid water environments, however, their performance \n\ndrops significantly when data from different reservoirs in a cascade system ranging from oligo-\n\nto-eutrophic environments are used together. Most of them tend to overestimate at low \n\nconcentration. For that reason, this study was aimed at assessing the performance of different \n\nwell-established models designed to retrieve a wide-range of TSM concentration. The \n\nperformance of these models was compared to two separate model calibrated to monitor the \n\nspatio-temporal variability of TSM in two oligo-to-eutrophic tropical reservoirs, Nav and BB, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n98 \n\nsituated in the cascade system of S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil. In addition, the environmental forcing \n\naffecting the water quality in these reservoirs was examined based on the performance of these \n\nmodels. The long-term spatio-temporal monitoring of these reservoirs has not been done before, \n\nwhich is a novel aspect of this study. The continued degradation of water quality in Brazilian \n\nreservoirs has been a cause for concern, and this study lays the foundation for a regular \n\nmonitoring protocol which can be used to decode the environmental forcing at play. \n\n \n\n6.2 Data and Methods \n\n \n\n6.2.1 Field data \n\n \n\nThe field trips occurred in two periods of the year, one coinciding with the beginning of \n\nthe dry season (Nav1: April 28 \u2013 May 2 and BB1: May 5 \u2013 9, 2104) and the other corresponding \n\nto the end of the dry season (Nav2: September 23 \u2013 26 and BB2: October 13 \u2013 16, 2014). A \n\ntotal of 63 in situ TSM samples and radiometric measurements were collected from both Nav \n\nand BB reservoirs, of which 50 samples were used for calibration and 13 for validation (see \n\nFigure 2.1 for sampling stations). These 13 samples were selected as validation dataset because \n\nmatched with MODIS Terra images overpass. Water samples were collected just below the air-\n\nwater interface and to determine TSM concentration using the method described by APHA \n\n(1998). Water samples were filtered on the same day of collection through pre-ashed and pre-\n\nweighed Whatmam fiberglass GF/F filter with a nominal porosity of 0.7 ?m and then stored at \n\nlow temperature in the refrigerator (-25\u00b0C) until analysis. The filters were dried in the oven at \n\n100\u00b0 C for 12 h, and then weighed using an analytical balance. The Chl-a was extracted with \n\n90% acetone solution and analyzed spectrophotometrically (GOLTERMAN et al., 1978). \n\n \n\n6.2.2 Remote sensing reflectance (???) \n \n\nRrs spectra were estimated from radiometric measurements taken between 10 am to 2 \n\npm local time. This procedure was carried out in order to maintain a consistent acquisition \n\ngeometry based on the time window of light availability (MOBLEY, 1999). At each sample \n\nstation, below and above water radiometric data were acquired using RAMSES TriOS\u00ae (TriOS, \n\nGermany) hyperspectral radiometers operating in the spectral range between 400 \u2013 900 nm. The \n\nradiance sensor was equipped with a 7\u00ba field-of-view and the irradiance sensor is equipped with \n\na cosine collector. The two radiance sensors positioned above water surface measured the total \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n99 \n\nupwelling radiance (?? (?); W m\n?2nm?1sr?1) i.e., the upward radiance from the water surface \n\nand the incident sky radiance (??(?); W m\n?2nm?1sr?1) i.e., the incoming light from the sky \n\n(Figure 6.1a). The irradiance sensor measured the downwelling irradiance \n\n(?? (?);  W m\n?2nm?1) i.e., the incident light onto the water surface. The single radiance sensor \n\npositioned inside the cage measured the upwelling radiance (??(?); W m\n?2nm?1sr?1), while \n\nthe irradiance sensors measured the upwelling irradiance (??(?); W m\n?2nm?1) and the \n\ndownwelling irradiance (?? (?); W m\n?2nm?1). The instruments above water surface were \n\npositioned on a steel frame and the ?? sensor was set with a viewing angle of 40\u00ba from nadir \n\nand an azimuth of 135\u00ba (oriented from the sun), and the ?? sensor was set with the same angles, \n\n40\u00ba from zenith and 1350 azimuth (Figure 6.1). \n\n \n\nFigure 6.1. Schematic diagram showing the (a) viewing angle (??) of the sensors to avoid \nspecular scattering (Mobley, 1999) (b) Geometry of the sensor relative to the sun used for \n\nradiometric measurements, represented by zenith (??), azimuthal (?) and nadir (???) angles, (c) \nsensors collecting total upwelling radiance ?? (?), the incident sky radiance ??(?) and the \ndownwelling irradiance ?? (?), (d) sensors collecting upwelling radiance ?? (?), upwelling \nirradiance ??(?) and the downwelling irradiance ?? (?). \n\n \n\n \n\nAll radiometric quantities were linearly interpolated to transform the original spectral \n\nresolution of ~ 3.3 nm to 1 nm. This procedure was designed to homogenize RAMSES \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n100 \n\nmeasurements between the sensors with different bandwidths and band centers. This technique \n\ndoes not affect the shape or magnitude of the spectral curves (FAN, 2014). The acquisition \n\ngeometry follows the protocol described by Mueller (2000) and Mobley (1999) and aimed at \n\nmeeting requirements to avoid the effects of radiance and specular boat shading. The in situ \n\nremote sensing reflectance (???(?)?????) (sr\n-1) was calculated from the radiometric profiles \n\naccording to Mobley (1999), Equation 4.1. \n\n??? is the input data for models to retrieve the OSCs concentration, however, it is \n\nnecessary to match the hyperspectral data with those from satellite data by simulating the \n\nsatellite sensor\u2019s bands using the spectral response function S(?) of the ith spectral band \n\n(GORDON, 1995; BARNES et al., 1998). In our study, MODIS Terra 250m and 500m bands \n\nwere simulated according to equation 4.2. \n\n \n\n6.2.3 Inherent Optical Properties (IOPs) \n\n \n\nWater samples were filtered through a 0.7 ?m porosity GF/F fiberglass filter that was \n\nstored flat under freezing condition. The determination of the total particulate (algal and non-\n\nalgal) absorption coefficient (??) was acquired by using an integrating sphere module presented \n\nin the double-beam Shimadzu UV-2600 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan), with \n\nspectral sampling from 280 nm to 800 nm. A white filter wetted with ultrapure water was used \n\nas reference. The filter containing the particulate was positioned in the integrating sphere to \n\nmeasure the optical density (OD). The T-R (Transmittance-Reflectance) method presented by \n\nTassan and Ferrari (1995, 1998) was employed to obtain ??. To acquire the phytoplankton (??) \n\nand non-algal particle (????) absorption coefficients, the filter underwent depigmentation by \n\noxidation in 10% sodium hypochlorite (NaClO), ensuring that the sample does not contain any \n\npigment interference. Using empirical relationships described by Tassan and Ferrari (1995, \n\n1998) the respective coefficients were determined, and to retrieve ??, the OD of the total \n\nparticulate was subtracted by the non-algal particle (NAP) fraction.  \n\nTo estimate the colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption coefficient \n\n(?????), water samples were filtered through a fiberglass Whatman GF/F with 0.7 ?m pores, \n\nand then re-filtered under low vacuum pressure using a Whatman nylon membrane filter with \n\n0.2 ?m pores. The readings were acquired using the absorbance mode and the samples were \n\nplaced in 10 cm quartz cuvettes. For each set of measurements, a reference reading containing \n\nMilli-Q water was performed, and for each sample (DOsample), the reference absorbance value \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n101 \n\nwas subtracted (DOreference). The measured optical densities (DOsample) were converted to \n\nabsorption coefficient multiplying by 2.303 and dividing by the path length (l = 0.1 m for a 10 \n\ncm cuvette). Hence, the ?????(?) (?\n?1) was calculated according to equation 3.2. \n\n \n\n6.2.4 Satellite Data and Processing \n\n \n\nMODIS sensor on board Terra platform (MODIS/Terra) has been providing images \n\nsince 1999. The orbit is near polar Sun-synchronous and it crosses the equator every 10:30 am \n\nlocal solar time. In addition, in 2002 another platform, MODIS sensor Aqua (MODIS/Aqua) \n\nwas launched providing afternoon images (1:30 pm equator crossing time) (BARNES et al., \n\n2003). Both satellites offer data in 36 spectral bands ranging from 0.4 \u00b5m to14.4 \u00b5m with a \n\nspatial resolution of 250 m (1 \u2013 2 bands), 500 m (3 \u2013 7 bands) and 1 km (8 \u2013 36 bands) \n\n(BARNES et al., 1998). MODIS land surface reflectance products (250 m MOD09GQ and 500 \n\nm MOD09GA from Terra) are daily Level 1B product, geo-located and corrected for \n\natmospheric gases and aerosols providing surface reflectance (SR) (VERMOTE and \n\nKOTCHENOVA, 2008; DOXARAN et al., 2009; VERMOTE et al., 2011). In particular, \n\nMODIS band 1 (640 \u2013 670 nm) has been widely employed to map the TSM concentration in \n\ninland and coastal waters (e.g., MILLER and MCKEE, 2004, ZHANG et al., 2010, CUI et al., \n\n2013, PARK and LATRUBESSE, 2014, KUMAR et al., 2016). \n\nBoth Terra and Aqua products are set to Sinusoidal projection and HDF-EOS format, \n\nthus a re-projection process was established to convert into geographical coordinate system \n\n(Datum: WGS 84) using SeaWiFS Data Analysis System \u2013 SeaDAS 7.2. The images from \n\nMODIS/Terra were acquired instead of MODIS/Aqua because of the lack of coincident in situ \n\ndata for Aqua (U.S. Geological Survey; http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/). The daily SR products \n\n(MOD09) were simulated based on the SRF, previously mentioned and used in the model \n\ncalibration. This process was employed because the MODIS/Terra images acquired during field \n\ndata collection were covered by clouds making it impossible build matchups between in situ \n\nand satellite data. However, the validation process was carried out using MOD09 SR data. This \n\nproduct corresponds to the water surface reflectance (R) and can be converted to water surface \n\nremote sensing reflectance (??? ???) dividing it by ? (WANG et al., 2015).  \n\nIn order to increase the possibilities of using more spectral bands (MOD09GA) with a \n\nbetter spatial resolution (MOD09GQ), a downscaling method was implemented to resample the \n\n500 m MODIS SR to 250 m MODIS SR (CHEN et al., 2015). Thereby, a resampling using \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n102 \n\nbilinear interpolation was applied as described in Srichandan et al (2015) and the correlation \n\nbetween 500 m and 250 m MODIS SR bands was verified. The downscaling process was carried \n\nout in SeaDAS. Land and clouds were masked out using band 2 as proposed by Miller &amp; McKee \n\n(2004) with an empirical threshold algorithm. \n\n \n\n6.2.5 Bio-optical model calibration and validation \n\n \n\nThe simulated bands from MODIS/Terra (??????) were applied as input to the empirical \n\nmodels used to estimate the TSM concentration (Table 6.1). Samples collected in the field were \n\ncompared with the ??? ??? from MODIS/Terra images of the same day and after visual \n\nexamination, five valid daily images were used. Numerous existing models broadly developed \n\nfor inland and coastal waters were employed in this research to analyze their performance in \n\nthe oligo-to-mesotrophic cascade reservoirs. \n\n \n\nTable 6.1.

Data from each study site were \n\nthen calibrated (??? = 30 and ???? = 20 samples) with the ??? ??? measures and validated \n\n(??? = 8 and ???? = 5) separately using the ??? ??? values. A mixed dataset was also \n\ncalibrated (n = 50) and validated (n = 13) in order to assess the performance of a single model \n\nto represent the TSM variability in the two widely different study sites.  \n\nThe evaluation of the re-parameterized TSM algorithms was carried out using statistical \n\nindicators such as root mean square error (RMSE), mean bias error (MBE), normalized root \n\nmean square error (NRMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R\u00b2). The indices are therefore \n\ndefined according to Equations (4.4), (5.1) and (6.1) respectively: \n\n \n\n????? =\n????\n\n??????\n\u00d7 100 (6.1) \n\n \n\nwhere ?????,? is related to the estimated and measured values. \n\n \n\n6.3 Results \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n104 \n\n6.3.1 Long-term spatio-temporal monitoring \n\n \n\nThe long-term analysis of both reservoirs was carried out for 16 years (2000 \u2013 2015) for \n\nthe months of May and October, representing the beginning and end of the dry season. At least \n\nfour TSM maps were generated each month using the MODIS 8-day composite images, and for \n\neach year two composite images were chosen to represent the months of May and October. \n\nImages collected in the same week and with no radiometric problem over the study sites were \n\nthe criteria to choose the images. A total of 128 images were used and 32 images were chosen \n\nto represent the spatial-temporal variability of TSM at the study sites. The MODIS/Terra 8-day \n\nproducts correspond to Level 3 data and contain the best possible observation during the eight \n\ndays, including the absence of clouds or cloud shadows and aerosol loading (available in \n\nhttps://lpdaac.usgs.gov/). Five locations for Nav and eight locations for BB were extracted from \n\neach of the 16 TSM maps for developing the boxplot representing the spatial variability. The \n\nselected locations were representative of each part of the reservoirs and additional care was \n\ntaken to avoid spurious values such as null pixels. \n\n \n\n6.3.2 Water quality characterization \n\n \n\nThe distribution of TSM concentration (Figure 6.2) in both reservoirs was highly \n\ndiscrepant due to the water quality differences between them. A significant majority (46.7%; n \n\n= 30) of the samples collected from BB had TSM values ranging from 16 to 26 mg l-1, whereas, \n\nmost of the samples from Nav (38.46%; n = 26) presented TSM values ranging from 0.6 to 1.0 \n\nmg l-1. \n\n \n\nFigure 6.2.

In addition, Nav exhibited \n\nvery low TSM values with an average of approximately 1 mg l-1 compared to BB where it \n\nshowed significant seasonal variability with mean TSM of 7.40 mg l-1in May and 21.91 mg l-1 \n\nin October. \n\n \n\nTable 6.2.

The TSM and Chl-a values showed a decreasing trend from BB to \n\nNav and the concentration magnitude was affected by the rainfall rate (Figure 2.3) which \n\nremained low during the beginning of the dry season and increased near the end of the dry \n\nseason. The Ch-a:TSM ratio exhibited low values in Nav compared to BB indicating the \n\ndominance of suspended matter in Nav and dominance of phytoplankton in BB.  \n\nThe Chl-a showed a strong linear relationship (Figure 6.3) with TSM in BB (R2 = 0.77, \n\np &lt;0.05, n = 38) and poorly correlated in Nav (R2 = 0.10, p > 0.05, n = 31). It indicated that \n\nthe TSM in BB is mostly algal turbidity and organic in nature, whereas, mostly inorganic in \n\nNav. In Nav, due to the low suspended sediment, the water was more transparent reaching a \n\nmaximum Secchi depth of 4.80 m and a minimum of 2.29 m during the first field campaign. A \n\nmaximum Secchi depth of 2.30 m was observed during first field campaign in BB and a \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n106 \n\nminimum of 0.40 m during second field campaign. Overall, the biogeochemical data presented \n\nin Table 2 and Figure 4 signifies the extreme variability observed between the two reservoirs, \n\nwhich makes the MODIS based TSM empirical model calibration a unique and challenging \n\ntask. \n\n \n\nFigure 6.3. Relationship between TSM (mg l-1) and Chl-a (mg m-3) in (a) BB and (b) Nav. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.3.3 Bio-optical properties description \n\n \n\nThe IOPs provide information about the contribution and dominance of certain OSC in \n\nthe water and can also assist in the estimation of these components using proper algorithms \n\n(MISHRA et al., 2014; RIDDICK et al., 2015). As expected, the most dominant OSC in BB \n\nwas found to be phytoplankton with an average contribution of 68.19 %, 66.76 %, and 79.85 % \n\nat 443, 555, and 645 nm, respectively (Figure 6.4). In Nav, the dominance of one single OSC \n\nwas not observed, and at 443 nm the CDOM dominated the total absorption coefficient except \n\nthe water component (????) with 37.36 % followed by NAP with 46.78 % at 555 nm and 39.65 \n\n% at 645 nm. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n107 \n\nFigure 6.4. Ternary graphs depicting the absorption budget at three wavelengths in the visible \n\nregion (a) blue \u2013 443 nm, (b) green \u2013 555 nm and (c) red \u2013 645 nm. \n\n \n\n \n\nAt 443 nm, the Nav samples were spread within the central zone of the ternary plot \n\nindicating that all three absorption coefficients co-varied somehow. The predominance of ?? \n\nin BB reservoirs at 645 nm was expected and is considered as a typical diagnostic feature of \n\nphytoplankton, however, unlike BB, the feature at the blue region was not detected in Nav, \n\npossibly due to the low concentration of this OSC and the predominance of another component \n\nsuch as CDOM (Figure 6.4a). Wu et al. (2011) reported a similar observation in the data from \n\nPoyang Lake, China, which showed an absorption peak at 675 nm, but did not show any sign \n\nof absorption between 430 \u2013 450 nm. They attributed this to the low concentration of \n\nphytoplankton. Doxaran et al. (2006) also noticed the same pattern in Tamar estuary, UK. These \n\nternary graphics reiterated the fact that both study sites are optically different and the data from \n\nBB were tightly clustered with low variability while Nav data were highly scattered indicating \n\na complex interplay of contribution of OSCs to the total absorption budget. \n\n???(?)????? spectra at various TSM concentrations between 0.5 mg l\n-1 to 32.8 mg l-1 \n\nwere analyzed with respect to the MODIS/Terra SR for bands at 469, 555 and 645 nm (Figure \n\n6.5). The spectra with 0.5, 1.2 and 2.6 mg l-1 (dashed lines) represent the data from Nav and the \n\nrest represent BB (solid lines). The shape and magnitude changed drastically with increasing \n\nTSM concentration. The three spectra from Nav assumed a flatter feature along the blue region \n\nwith the presence of a peak between 500 \u2013 600 nm highlighting the influence of inorganic matter \n\n(NOVO et al., 1991). The same result was also described in Nascimento (2010) studying the \n\nItumbiara Reservoir, Brazil, showing the dominance of detritus (60%) and Chl-a (40%) in the \n\ntotal absorption budget. The spectra represented by the 5.0 mg l-1 concentration, also showed a \n\nflatter pattern along the blue to green wavelengths and a peak between 500 \u2013 600 nm, however, \n\nnew features raised in the red region depicting the presence of ?? approximately at 675 nm; \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n108 \n\nand a ???(?)????? peak between 700 \u2013 725 nm, also highlighting the presence of Chl-a. The \n\nmagnitude of the ???(?)????? spectra showed a systematic increase with TSM concentration \n\nand at concentrations higher than 10.78 mg l-1, the spectra showed signs of algal turbidity in \n\nterms of phytoplankton interaction such as the absorption maxima at 675 nm and minima at \n\n708 nm (MISHRA and MISHRA, 2012). At high concentration, i.e., at 32.8 mg l-1, it also \n\nshowed a cyanobacteria signature with a characteristic absorption feature at 620 nm and a \n\nreflectance peak at 650 nm (MISHRA et al., 2009; MISHRA et al., 2013). Spectral features \n\nwere absent over 750 nm in Nav indicating that the backscattering from other OSC was not \n\npresent. On the other hand, in BB is very clear that light was backscattered by other OSCs. \n\n \n\nFigure 6.5. ???(?)????? spectra representing different TSM concentrations overlapped with \n\nMODIS Terra spectral response function for bands at (A) 469 nm, (B) 555 nm and (D) 645 nm. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe feature at 645 nm corresponding to MODIS band 1 described different behavior for \n\nNav and BB. As illustrated in Figure 6.4(c), in Nav, detritus contributed with ~40% to the total \n\nabsorption budget, while in BB, phytoplankton contributed with ~80% justifying the \n\nappearance of a shoulder in approximately 645 nm followed by a reflectance peak at 650 nm. \n\n \n\n6.3.4 Downscaling MODIS image procedure \n\n \n\nMODIS MOD09GA 500 m data from bands 3 to 7 (center bands at: 469, 555, 1240, \n\n1640 and 2130 nm, respectively) were resampled to 250 m based on MOD09GQ product in \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n109 \n\norder to increase the spatial resolution of bands 3 \u2013 7 used in the calibration process. The \n\nbilinear interpolation method was applied aiming to divide the 500 m pixel into four 250 m \n\npixels. Relationship between the downscaled MODIS 500 m data and the original MODIS 500 \n\nm was verified in order to assure that after resampling procedure, the pixels still represent the \n\nspectral characteristic of the respective bands. A strong correlation (R\u00b2 = 0.96. p-value &lt;0.05) \n\nwas observed between downscaled MODIS 500 m (band 3) and the original MODIS 500 m \n\n(band 3) related to May, 2014 associated to the first field dataset (Figure 6.6). The same result \n\nwas also observed for band 3 related to October, 2014 corresponding to the second field dataset \n\n(R\u00b2 = 0.83, p-value &lt;0.05).  \n\n \n\nFigure 6.6.

Besides the wide and easy applicability of the empirical models, some studies \n\n(KONG et al., 2015a, b) have shown better results from these models at low TSM \n\nconcentrations compared to semi-analytical models. Miller and McKee (2004) single band \n\nmodel based solely on BB data (Table 6.3) achieved a strong exponential correlation (R\u00b2 = 0.83, \n\np &lt;0.005, n = 30) followed by the power (R\u00b2 = 0.82, p &lt;0.0001, n = 30), quadratic (R\u00b2 = 0.78, \n\np &lt;0.0001, n = 30) and linear (R\u00b2 = 0.75, p &lt;0.0001, n = 30) fits. Similar calibration for Nav \n\nwas statistically significant (p &lt;0.05), however, the model based on Miller and McKee had a \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n110 \n\npoor performance when compared with BB. Both linear and quadratic models for Nav, \n\ndisplayed similar determinant coefficients presenting R\u00b2 = 0.51 and R\u00b2 = 0.52, respectively.  \n\n \n\nTable 6.3.

The potential of these wavelengths \n\nin retrieving TSM can be explained by the bio-optical properties of the water. In turbid inland \n\nwaters with low phytoplankton concentration, the absorption coefficient tends to decrease with \n\nincreasing wavelength getting close to zero at the red and NIR regions whilst the backscattering \n\ncoefficient of suspended sediment increases in those regions (DOXARAN et al., 2006, CUI et \n\nal., 2013). However, according to Figure 6.4, it is clear that BB is highly affected by \n\nphytoplankton absorption in the red wavelength and Nav is dominated by particulate and water \n\nitself. A significant quadratic correlation between the band ratio ??? ???(645)/?????? (469) and \n\nin situ TSM in log scale (R\u00b2 = 0.76, p &lt;0.0001) was obtained using the mixed dataset from Nav \n\nand BB (n = 50), followed by the logarithmic (R\u00b2 = 0.69, p &lt;0.0001) and linear (R\u00b2 = 0.64, p &lt;\n\n0.0001) models. Previous studies have shown a good relationship between log transformed \n\nwater quality data (TSM and Chl-a) and Rrs for productive waters such as those on Florida's \n\nnorthwest coast (WANG et al., 2010; CHEN et al., 2011). Olmanson et al. (2013) highlighted \n\nthat the water quality data could behave normally or near normal when they are log transformed, \n\nagreeing with assumptions of regression. Fan (2014) who retrieved TSM concentration using \n\nin situ hyperspectral data also achieved a good relationship using a linear model based on the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n111 \n\nspectral ratio of 650/420 in Patuxent River, tributary of Chesapeake Bay, USA. It is noteworthy \n\nthat a statistically significant relationship does not always result in small errors, thus all the \n\nmodels and their respective variations were validated. \n\nTo validate the calibrated models, ??????  extracted from MODIS images were used. \n\nAmong all the tested models, the approach using two calibration equations, one for each \n\nreservoir retrieved the lowest error instead of applying a single model to the mixed data. The \n\nmodel based on exponential fit of band 1 showed a RMSE = 3.66 mg l-1 and a NRMSE = \n\n31.54% for BB, and for Nav, both linear and quadratic models had very similar results with a \n\nslight improvement of the linear fit (RMSE = 0.37 mg l-1 and NRMSE = 29.43%) over the \n\nquadratic fit (RMSE = 0.37 mg l-1 and NRMSE = 29.48%). The model related to the mixed data \n\npresented the highest RMSE with the linear fit (RMSE = 64.70 mg l-1 and NRMSE = 401.89%) \n\nand the lowest error with the logarithm equation (RMSE = 5.48 mg l-1 and NRMSE = 34.04%) \n\nbut even so, overestimating the TSM values for Nav. The NMRSE was also high compared to \n\nthe approach using different models for each study site. For that reason, the exponential model \n\nbased on band 1 was used to map BB and the linear equation also based on band 1 was used to \n\nmap Nav. \n\nThe predicted TSM from BB was, in general, underestimated (bias = -1.98 mg l-1) but \n\nthe residuals did not present any trend. According to Dogliotti et al. (2015), high errors at 645 \n\nnm are associated with phytoplankton absorption considering productive environments with \n\nChl-a > 30 mg m-3. Thus, the underestimation might be related to the phytoplankton absorption, \n\nwhich is masking the reflectance and therefore the model\u2019s performance. TSM predicted from \n\nNav was overestimated (bias = 0.14 mg l-1) and no clear trend in residual was observed. This \n\noverestimation can be explained by the increment of combined effect of both water and \n\nphytoplankton absorption in the red spectral region. Cui et al. (2013) also draw attention to the \n\nfact that shallow waters and submerged vegetation might be the reason of this overestimation. \n\nNav is affected by submerged vegetation mainly at the edges of the reservoir and Rotta et al. \n\n(2016) studied the effect of radiation availability on development and growth of this type of \n\nvegetation in a tributary of Nav reservoir. The predicted TSM produced by the mixed data \n\noverestimated the low concentrations but did not present any trend. These results emphasize \n\nthe poor performance of one single model to describe the TSM variability in two widely \n\ndifferent environments in terms of limnology and optical properties. On the other hand, the \n\nseparate approach showed to be suitable to map the TSM variability.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n112 \n\nThis type of poor performance by a single model was not found by Chen et al. (2015), \n\nwho used a quadratic log-ratio model based on red and NIR MODIS-250 m bands to study a \n\nwide range of TSM concentration (5.8 \u2013 577.2 mg l-1) in China\u2019s estuaries and coastal waters. \n\nAfter validation, they found a RMSE = 37.9 mg l-1 for TSM > 31 mg l-1 and a RMSE = 3.25 \n\nmg l-1 for TSM ? 31 mg l-1, however, when applied to the data from Nav and BB (mixed data), \n\nthe RMSE was 18.60 mg l-1 showing the site-specific limitation of this model in retrieving TSM \n\nin an environment different from the one used to calibrate the original model. Han et al. (2016) \n\nalso worked with a wide-range TSM concentration (0.15 \u2013 2,626 mg l-1) from clear to very \n\nturbid waters around the world but used a semi-analytical (SAA) way to retrieve this parameter \n\nwith a RMSE > 1.8 mg l-1. The authors make it clear that splitting the data into clear to medium \n\nturbid and highly turbid waters, increases the accuracy of TSM retrieval. Thus, they created \n\nTSM-range dependent algorithms considering concentrations lower and higher than 100 mg l-1 \n\nand then introduced a weighting function aiming to avoid artificial spatial pattern in TSM \n\ndistribution. The SAA algorithm when applied to the low TSM range produced a RMSE of \n\n11.07 mg l-1 for Nav and BB data, which is high considering the range found in both reservoirs. \n\nFactors such as optical properties and water composition shown to be greatly responsible for \n\nthe inefficiency of a single model built to map a range between very low (values predominantly \n\nlower than 1.00 mg l-1) to moderate TSM concentration (&lt;44.00 mg l-1) such as in Nav and BB, \n\nrespectively. \n\nBinding et al. (2010) highlighted that the choice of the model and suitable band depends \n\non the optical characteristic of the water and the range of TSM concentration. According to \n\nFigure 6.4, inorganic matter and CDOM basically control the optical characteristics of the water \n\nin Nav. Presence of CDOM and phytoplankton affects the visible bands (wavelengths shorter \n\nthan 550 nm), constraining the use of a band with shorter wavelength for determining TSM \n\nconcentration in optically complex waters (BINDING et al., 2010). Binding et al. (2005) \n\nshowed that high mineral suspended solid (MSS) concentration increases the reflectance in \n\nlonger wavelengths and the minimal influence of CDOM in this region suggest the use of red \n\nchannel to map MSS. These findings support the fact that at 645 nm, the model based on Nav\u2019s \n\ndataset, performed better than other models. On the other hand, in BB, TSM is primarily \n\nphytoplankton dominated, which means that ??? will be low in the visible spectral region due \n\nto high absorption by pigments. This increase in chl-a concentration (> 100 \u00b5g l-1) can affect \n\nthe TSM reflectance between 400 and 700 nm, and the chl-a behavior starts to overshadow the \n\nTSM reflectance characteristics (SV\u00c1B et al., 2005). Song et al. (2014) showed a high \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n113 \n\ncorrelation coefficient between TSM and reflectance at approximately 700 nm in turbid water \n\ndominated by algal and non-algal particles, insinuating that for productive inland waters, the \n\nbest approach may be to use the longer wavelengths. However, for BB the band 1 based non-\n\nlinear model achieved the best performance compared to both linear and non-linear fits using \n\nthe band at 859 nm. \n\nThe nature of the water composition can be explained by the LULC of the watershed, \n\nwhich is responsible for the inputs of OSCs affecting the optical properties. LULC such as \n\nurban and agriculture can act as a source for nutrients enrichment in water systems. High loads \n\nof nutrients can lead to the increase of primary production and consequently the increase of \n\n?? (443). Particle matter content can also influence ????(443) (LE et al., 2015). Bernardes et \n\nal. (2004) found that high values of delta thirteen carbon (?13?) in the ultrafiltered dissolved \n\norganic matter were correlated to areas covered with pasture in the Ji-Paran\u00e1 Basin, Amazon, \n\nwhich means that the replacement of primary forests by pastures for cattle feeding has changed \n\nthe composition of the riverine organic matter. Further discussion about this topic can be found \n\nin the following sections.  \n\n \n\n6.3.6 TSM spatio-temporal variability \n\n \n\nImages from May (beginning of the dry season) and October (end of the dry season) for \n\nthe period from 2000 to 2015 were chosen to analyze the spatio-temporal variability of TSM \n\nusing the most accurate model for each reservoir. The models based on visible wavelengths \n\nproved to be more applicable for moderate ranges of TSM instead of band ratio, which showed \n\nto be more correlated to environments dominated by MSS (DOXARAN et al., 2002, BINDING \n\net al., 2003). Song et al. (2014) observed a high correlation between band ratios and TSM for \n\nturbid productive waters at the Chl-a absorption bands in the lake Taihu, China. Such band \n\nratios (e.g., MODIS B1/B3) were not able to retrieve TSM accurately in these reservoirs with \n\nwidely varying optical properties. The pattern of TSM distribution across both seasons was \n\nconsistent with previous studies (CAVENAGHI et al., 2003; PANHOTA and BIANCHINI Jr., \n\n2003; ZANATA, 2005). The spatio-temporal distribution of TSM in Nav showed very low \n\nconcentrations in the entire reservoir in May with majority of the pixels ranging between 0 \u2013 \n\n1.2 mg l-1 (Figure 6.7). In October, the TSM concentration increased slightly but \n\nhomogeneously in the entire reservoir with most of the pixels concentrated between 0.6 \u2013 2.6 \n\nmg l-1. In BB, TSM ranged from 5.01 to 10 mg l-1 in May and 35 to 50 mg l-1 in October. In \n\ngeneral, BB is much more turbid than Nav (Figure 6.8). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n114 \n\nFigure 6.7. Spatio-temporal distribution of TSM over the main body of Nav based on MODIS \n\n8-day composite images for months of May and October from 2000 to 2015. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n115 \n\nFigure 6.8. Spatio-temporal distribution of TSM over the main body of BB based on MODIS \n\n8-day composite images for the months of May and October from 2000 to 2015. The blank \n\nregion represent the locations where the model extrapolated the TSM values over 150 m l-1. \n\n \n\n \n\nFactors such as geomorphology, LULC setting, location, wind, river flow, climatic \n\nconditions and topography tend to impact the range and variability of TSM in a reservoir \n\n(WANG et al., 2010). Therefore, the high TSM in October compared to May in both reservoirs \n\nis probably because of the high rainfall induced runoff from the upland watersheds that \n\ntransports sediment and other materials into the reservoirs. The spatial distribution of TSM in \n\nNav showed a homogeneous dispersion along the reservoir and can be related to the type of \n\noperation of the dam, which is a run-of-river, and the shape of this reservoir that is elongated \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n116 \n\nand continuous. These features lead to low variation of the water level, high frequency and \n\nbehaving as a semi-lotic environment with intermediate fluvial characteristics (PERBICHE-\n\nNEVES et al., 2011; PERBICHE-NEVES and NOGUEIRA, 2013). On the other hand, TSM in \n\nBB varied spatially showing high values around the island that is connected to the Araqu\u00e1 River \n\n(see Figure 2.1 for location) in May mainly because of contributions from anthropogenic \n\nsources such as sugarcane plantations. In addition, this region is very susceptible to the \n\nproliferation of floating macrophytes and as stated in Cavenaghi et al. (2003), the presence of \n\nthese floating vegetation was related to the sedimentation process located in the reservoir`s edge \n\nand coming from the confluents. Overall, higher values of TSM were found in October and the \n\nwater coming from the Tiet\u00ea River contributed less than Piracicaba River.   \n\nThe overestimation found in BB map can be associated to the limitation of the model to \n\nrepresent concentrations over 50 mg l-1. Cui et al. (2013) also noticed a saturation problem using \n\nthe red band from MODIS/Terra indicating that the exponential model may introduce high \n\nerrors when applied in very turbid waters. Wu et al. (2013) faced the same problem using non-\n\nlinear models based on red band from MODIS/Terra and to overcome this issue, they used a \n\nNIR based linear model, but after validation, the accuracy was very low (correlation of 0.54). \n\nFeng et al. (2014) highlighted the same concern of saturation for high TSM concentrations when \n\napplying blue and red bands based models and they came up with a model based on two \n\nequations: one for TSM &lt;50 mg l-1 (using the red band from MODIS) and other for TSM > \n\n150 mg l-1 (using the band ratio between NIR over red), both using the exponential fit. Low \n\nconcentrations of TSM can be problematic for mapping. Kumar et al. (2016) found that in \n\nChilika Lake, the MODIS-based model was not suitable for retrieving TSM concentrations \n\nbelow 6.54 mg l-1. Han et al. (2016) tested Nechad et al. (2010) model using their wide-range \n\nTSM and noticed that values lower than 1.2 mg l-1 were overestimated. Therefore, it can be \n\nconcluded that all MODIS based TSM algorithms tested in this study are somewhat site or \n\nregion specific. A truly scalable TSM algorithm that fits all water bodies is not available. That \n\nexplains why there are so many variations of semi-empirical TSM models in the literature. \n\nMany of them applied in this study proved that they are in fact not highly scalable across broad \n\ngeographic regions and turbidity regimes. \n\nAnother issue that also affects the model performance is related to the quality of the \n\nimage, especially with regards to atmospheric correction. Wang et al. (2015) improved the \n\nsignal of ??? by subtracting the average response from SWIR bands (centered in 1640 and 2130 \n\nnm) in order to offset the deficiency in the original atmospheric correction of MOD09 product. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n117 \n\nThis approach was used in Lake Taihu, China, which is very turbid and productive system, \n\nhowever, the performance of this approach was not satisfactory to less turbid systems such as \n\nNav and BB. Therefore, the correction proposed by Wang et al. (2015) produced negative \n\nvalues after subtraction by SWIR bands and was not included in this paper. \n\nThe TSM variability in different sectors of the reservoirs can be seen in Figure 6.9. In \n\nNav, samples picked at five different locations along the reservoir showed a homogeneous \n\nbehavior from 2000 to 2015 in May. In October, the magnitude of TSM increased, however, \n\nnone of the sectors stood out from the rest, highlighting the homogenous distribution in Nav.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n118 \n\nFigure 6.9.

(e) TSM (mg l-1) \n\nconcentration from field campaigns carried out in Tiet\u00ea River (Barra Bonita \u2013 BB, Bariri \u2013 B, \n\nIbitinga \u2013 I, Promiss\u00e3o \u2013 P, Nova Avanhandava \u2013 Nav) except for Tr\u00eas Irm\u00e3os (TI) reservoir in \n\n2000 (CAVENAGHI et al., 2003) (solid lines); including all reservoirs along the Tiet\u00ea River \n\nduring the years 2001 and 2002 (ZANATA, 2005) (dotted lines) and in the lower Tiet\u00ea basin \n\nduring 2008 and 2009 (dashed lines) (SANTOS, 2010). \n\n \n\n \n\nOverall, the MODIS/Terra based maps showed the seasonal influence in TSM \n\nconcentration. The rainy season contributes to the entry of autochthonous matter from the \n\nwatershed increasing the concentration of particulate matter. In situ TSM data based on \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n119 \n\ndifferent studies carried out in Tiet\u00ea River basin in different dates are presented to support the \n\nanalysis (Figure 6.9e). TSM tend to increase during October and the opposite was observed for \n\nApril and May. The same trend was found in other studies for the site (BARBOSA et al., 1999, \n\nCAVENAGHI et al., 2003) and the gradient of TSM decreases from the upstream to \n\ndownstream reservoirs, becoming less pronounced in the low basin reservoirs, Promiss\u00e3o, Nav \n\nand Tr\u00eas Irm\u00e3os. As highlighted by Rodgher et al. (2005), the suspended matter originated from \n\nTiet\u00ea and Piracicaba Rivers in the rainy season is very high when compared to that of the dry \n\nseason. The turbidity composed by inorganic fraction diminished significantly in BB, however, \n\nthis change is less noticeable in the downstream reservoirs (BARBOSA et al., 1999). \n\n \n\n6.3.7 Factors affecting optical changes in the reservoirs \n\n \n\nThe poor accuracy of the mixed model can be attributed to the differences in the water \n\nquality composition of both sites. BB is phytoplankton dominated while Nav is inorganic matter \n\ndominated with contribution of CDOM at 443 nm. Although the same river is the source for \n\nboth reservoirs, the LULC compositions of the watershed are different and as stated by Sandes \n\n(1990), it is necessary to consider the input of pollutants by diffuse and punctual sources in each \n\nreservoir. The BB watershed is covered by urban centers, bare soil, agriculture fields, and \n\nshrubland also represented by planted crops. Nav is occupied in general by agriculture with low \n\ninfluence of urban centers. Urban and agriculture activities contribute with the fluctuations of \n\ninorganic nutrients levels changing the primary producers (TONG and CHEN, 2002; \n\nROBINSON et al., 2014). Ahearn et al. (2005) found a good correlation between agriculture \n\nand nitrate-N loading as well as Coulter et al. (2004) who also observed agriculture as a greater \n\nsource of nutrients when compared with urban land uses that yielded high suspended sediment \n\nconcentrations. Tu (2011; 2013) and Zhao et al. (2015) pointed out that agriculture can be a \n\nsource of pollution in less-urbanized watersheds, however, the contrary is true when agriculture \n\nis interleaved in a highly-urbanized watershed. This is because in highly urbanized areas the \n\npollution coming from agriculture is negligible and often masked by urban sources. Li et al. \n\n(2008) studying the Han River, China, observed that both urban and agriculture areas have \n\ndominant control on TSM concentration. Besides, the authors also noticed that vegetated \n\ncoverage was related to water temperature, nitrogen and the high vegetation cover presented \n\nlow turbidity, suspended particulate matter, nutrients and total dissolved solids. The Tiet\u00ea River \n\ncatchment basin is highly affected by anthropogenic activities that are considered a pollution \n\nsource. As stated by Petesse et al. (2014), the catchment portion in the upstream of the BB \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n120 \n\nreservoir is densely populated with twenty-six million people (90.5% of the total Tiet\u00ea River \n\nbasin population). A similar study by Im et al. (2015) revealed that wastewater coming from \n\nthe city was the major source of water quality deterioration on Cheung Ek Lake, Thailand. \n\nBusse et al. (2006) also concluded that algal biomass increases with urbanization and during \n\nsummer, chlorophyll concentrations were correlated to light and nutrient levels. Activities such \n\nas industry and agriculture are also highly active in this region mainly related to sugarcane \n\nplantation. Barra Bonita municipality has a biomass power plant which produces vinasse as \n\nresidue and further used as fertilizer for sugarcane plantations. This byproduct of the sugarcane \n\nindustry is composed by nutrients (potassium calcium, nitrogenous, sulfur and magnesium) and \n\nis absorbed by plants and also drained through the soil reaching the aquatic system (PRADO, \n\n2004).  \n\nAgriculture is also predominant around Nav sub-basin; however, the water quality is \n\nbetter than that of BB (BARBOSA et al., 1999) suggesting that other factors, in addition to \n\nagriculture, could be more important for the poor water quality in BB. Tiet\u00ea and Piracicaba \n\nrivers are susceptible to domestic and industrial contamination due to the proximity to urban \n\ncenters along its course. Carvalho et al. (2005) highlighted that the occurrence of floating \n\nvegetation in BB is due to high turbidity and, on the other hand, submerged vegetation is \n\nfrequent in low turbidity environments such as Nav. According to Cavenaghi et al. (2003), the \n\nphosphate values are higher in BB reservoir (average value of 170 \u00b5g l-1 in 2001 and 2002) than \n\nthose further downstream such as Nav (25.42 \u00b5g l-1). A similar decreasing pattern is also \n\nobserved for suspended solids, turbidity and electrical conductivity. As discussed here, the \n\nLULC have a direct effect on the water quality increasing the eutrophication process in \n\nmanmade water bodies and ultimately changing in optical water quality. Different water \n\ncomposition and a wide TSM range can induce systematic error in red and NIR based TSM \n\nmodels.  \n\n \n\n6.4 Conclusion \n\n \n\nOptical and water quality in situ data were collected from two widely different \n\nreservoirs, eutrophic Barra Bonita and oligo-mesotrophic Nova Avanhandava, along Tiet\u00ea \n\nRiver\u2019s cascade reservoir system. The data were used to calibrate a TSM algorithm for the \n\nMODIS/Terra satellite surface reflectance products. Several empirical TSM models were tested \n\nfor the reservoirs (TSM range: 0\u201344 mg l-1) using simulated remote sensing reflectance (??? ???) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n121 \n\nfor calibration and remote sensing reflectance of the satellite (??? ???) for validation. \n\nConsidering the variability of TSM values at both sites, the site-specific models had a good fit \n\nand represented the spatial pattern of this optically significant component well. The source and \n\nnature of water quality parameters were crucial to understand the limitations of a single \n\nempirical model in characterize optically different environments. Besides, the bio-optical \n\nmodels showed to be constrained by the watershed composition.  \n\nBB reservoir receives sediment contribution from two rivers: Tiet\u00ea and Piracicaba and \n\nduring the beginning of the dry season, it was noticed that high values of TSM is associated \n\nwith the flow from Tiet\u00ea River. This high sediment load creates a favorable condition for \n\nemergent macrophytes that float downstream toward the dam. On the other hand, TSM spatial \n\ndistribution in Nav was very homogeneous along the whole reservoir and besides, the variability \n\nduring the water collections was not outstanding; mainly due to the type of operation of that \n\nreservoir, that is run-of-river.  \n\nThe spatial analysis results from this study corroborate with other studies regarding the \n\nimprovement of water quality from upstream to downstream in a cascade system, showing the \n\ndifference in water composition for both sites. The TSM from BB showed a strong relationship \n\nwith phytoplankton and the TSM from Nav was influenced by inorganic matter. Use of a single \n\nmodel to resolve the TSM of different origins was not possible and site-specific approach \n\nworked best to resolve the spatial variability of TSM in these reservoirs. The monitoring of the \n\nwater quality in a cascade system such as this using an accurate single model is very challenging \n\nbecause of the wide variability of water quality and optical properties along the same river \n\nacross a varying LULC gradient. Understanding of the environmental forcing that affect each \n\nreservoir\u2019s water quality could be the key to designing a robust monitoring approach. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n122 \n\nCHAPTER 7: CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RECOMMENDATIONS \n\n \n\n7.1 Conclusion \n\n \n\nThe results achieved in this thesis confirmed the hypothesis that organic and inorganic \n\ndominated waters such as BB and Nav, respectively, decrease the performance of a single \n\nempirical model to estimate TSS; however, after recalibrating the empirical steps of QAA, the \n\nperformance of the model increased and could estimate ?? accurately, considering both \n\nreservoirs. \n\nThe OSCs collected between 2014 to 2016 showed considerable changes between BB \n\nand Nav. The first one was more turbid and phytoplankton dominated, while Nav was less \n\nproductive and presented more clear water. The OSC concentration varied in magnitude \n\naccording to the field trips showing high dependence of rainfall condition. The year of 2014 \n\nshowed atypical rainfall condition leading to modifications in water quality mainly in BB which \n\nis a storage system, therefore accumulates water during the dry season. The average Chl-a \n\nconcentration increased from 120.4 \u00b5g l-1 in May/2014 to 428.7 \u00b5g l-1 in October/2014. \n\nHowever, in Nav the Chl-a concentration did not vary showing averages of 6.2 \u00b5g l-1 and 9.0 \n\n\u00b5g l-1 in April-May/2014 and September/2014, respectively. This was probably related to the \n\noperation system, in this case, a run-of-river reservoir, so the water flows continuously not \n\nstoring for dry periods. A third data collection was carried out in Nav (May/2016) but the lowest \n\nrainfall rate in the previous months, even less than 2014, led to the increase of primary \n\nproduction and consequently the increase of the average Chl-a concentration (26.4 \u00b5g l-1). The \n\nsame pattern happened for TSS, also affecting the water transparency. \n\nThis water quality scenario echoed to the optical properties. Nav, for example, showed \n\nhigh variance in the absorption at 443 nm with ???? in Nav1 and CDOM, ????? in Nav2. The \n\nNav3 was dominated by ????. At 560 nm, ???? varied with other components but was \n\ndominant at all field trips and at 665 nm the phytoplankton (??) was dominant, except for Nav2 \n\nthat varied with other components. As expected BB was fully dominated by phytoplankton with \n\npercentages reaching 87% in BB2 at 665 nm, however at 443 and 560 nm its dominance was \n\nbelow 50% for BB1, highlighting the interference of other components. The implication of \n\nthese findings to the bio-optical modeling is important, because we now understand that Nav is \n\nhighly affected by NAP and CDOM at the blue and green regions rather than phytoplankton. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n123 \n\nBB, on the other hand, was dominated by ?? at 665 nm, not varying with other components, so \n\nthis wavelength must be recommended for Chl-a estimation.  \n\nThe IOPs showed to be useful for water characterization, and they are used in several \n\nsemi-analytical models, therefore the use of remote sensing approaches seems to be valuable \n\nfor water quality monitoring. Nav is categorized as inland water, however, is not productive \n\nwhich is different from the previous waters used in QAA parametrization. All these versions \n\nfailed leading to the definition of new steps for QAA and here named as QAAOMR. The main \n\nissue behind this failure was first addressed to the reference wavelength selection, which is \n\nresponsible to highlight just the contribution of water in the total absorption budget. The \n\nobstacle found on previous QAAs was related to ??(?) retrieval based on simple subtraction \n\nbetween ??(?) and ????(?), however, the errors was very high surpassing 100% of uncertainties \n\nconsidering specific wavelengths. Therefore, we came up with a new approach recently \n\nsuggested by Ogashawara et al. (2016) but with relevant modifications aiming to derive ?? \n\n(443) based on Lee et al. (2010) and the normalized ??\n+ (?) discussed by Roesler et al. (1989). \n\nA great improvement was achieved with uncertainties below 50% (412 \u2013 681 nm). An \n\nindependent dataset was used for validation and the QAAOMR showed to be robust in retrieving \n\nthe IOPs, and even assuring the necessity of use data from broader geographic regions, the \n\nmodel comes to give a better solution for waters characterized as oligo-to-mesotrophic and \n\ndominated by inorganic matter. \n\nAs previously described, both reservoirs are optically different, however, for water \n\nmanagement purposes is very important to use a single approach to retrieve optical water \n\nproperties covering the whole cascade system. The QAA from Watanabe et al. (2016), \n\nQAABBHR, was parametrized using data from BB and the results was very satisfactory, however \n\nit showed limitations in retrieving ?? (?), therefore, we evaluated the performance of each QAA \n\nin retrieving ?? (?), ???? (?) and ?? (?) pointing out the main issues surrounding their \n\nestimative. Both QAA versions (QAABBHR and QAAOMR) could retrieve ?? (?) considering \n\ndifferent types of water with a slight advantage of QAABBHR. Therefore, a single model can be \n\nsuitable to estimate at least ?? (?), considering different trophic state waters. On the contrary, \n\nmore efforts must be carried out for improving the ???? (?) and ?? (?) estimation aiming to \n\nreduce the errors below 50%. \n\nRegarding the performance of an empirical model for TSM retrieval considering the \n\ndata from both reservoirs, several empirical models were tested considering the TSM range of \n\n0 and 44 mg l-1 using simulated remote sensing reflectance (??? ???) for calibration and remote \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n124 \n\nsensing reflectance of the satellite (??? ???) for validation. However, none of those models could \n\ncover the range of the study sites. For very low concentration, the single model tended to \n\noverestimate sediment concentration and the use of the linear adjustment based on the red band \n\ncould improve the result significantly. On the other hand, the moderate concentration was \n\nsuccessfully retrieved using the exponential fit of red band. The main issue concerning the use \n\nof single model was related to the bio-optical properties from both reservoirs. As previously \n\nmentioned, the sediment composition of BB is primarily composed by phytoplankton whilst \n\nNav is inorganic dominated water. These properties limit the use of a single approach aiming \n\nto cover very low to moderate TSM concentrations. To address this issue, semi-analytical \n\napproaches could be a potential way to model wide range of sediment concentration and it will \n\nbe considered for future works. \n\n \n\n7.2 Future Recommendations \n\n \n\nThe current results showed great improvements in remote sensing of inland waters \n\nresearches, although this was just the start of a series of issues that need to be addressed. \n\nUnderstanding the bio-optical diversity of individual environments such as the reservoirs of the \n\nTiet\u00ea River is very important, however, when we consider the entire cascade the bio-optical \n\nmodeling approach quite changes. So, for future works it is worth to include as many data as \n\npossible from all the elements of the cascade to turn the study area more representative. \n\nBesides, it is also relevant to analyze not only the longitudinal modifications along the \n\nsystem but also the relationship between the anthropogenic activities, such as agriculture, \n\nindustries and urban centers, that surround the reservoirs and they are part of the watershed \n\ndynamic. Few works have relating the impact of the LULC on the IOPs, but they already know \n\nthat the watershed is the source of OSC, that affects the optical properties of inland waters. \n\nIn terms of OSC retrieval in wide range of concentrations, empirical models have shown \n\ntheir limitation in cover both low and high concentrations, so the development of semi-\n\nanalytical approaches based not only on radiance or reflectance, but also the IOPs may be a \n\ngood way out for this situation. In the case of Tiet\u00ea River, split the cascade according to the \n\ntrophic state can possibly be a first step for water monitoring. The reservoirs from the Low \n\nbasin present a better water quality than those upstream in the Middle basin, therefore they can \n\nbe merged and worked initially together. \n\nThe QAAOMR showed great enhancements for IOPs retrieval and it showed to be the \n\nonly one, which, up to now, was parameterized in inland water with limited primary production \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n125 \n\nand dominated by inorganic matter. However, the estimation of ?? (?) still needs attention. For \n\nfuture works, data of absorption, scattering and backscattering coefficients collected in the field \n\nby robust instruments such as the ac-s and the ECO-BB9 from WETLabs, needs to be included \n\nin the process of validation and tuning of empirical steps of QAA. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRodrigues, T.W.P. \n\n126 \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\nAHEARN, D.
