Por\u00e9m, esses avan\u00e7os apresentam consequ\u00eancias como uma \nmaior taxa de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de calor por efeito Joule, elevando a temperatura \nde opera\u00e7\u00e3o desses componentes. Para garantir as condi\u00e7\u00f5es de \nopera\u00e7\u00e3o, s\u00e3o empregados dispositivos com capacidade de transferir \ngrandes taxas de calor. Dentre estes dispositivos, se encontram os tubos \nde calor em circuito ou LHP\u2019s (Loop Heat Pipes). No segmento \naeron\u00e1utico, devido ao crescente uso de equipamentos eletr\u00f4nicos, as \ntecnologias de tubos de calor, mais especificamente de LHPs, t\u00eam sido \ncada vez mais utilizadas, pois s\u00e3o passivas, podem funcionar sem o \naux\u00edlio da gravidade e transportam o calor a m\u00e9dia e longa dist\u00e2ncia. As \nestruturas capilares que comp\u00f5em estes dispositivos s\u00e3o fabricadas \nbasicamente de materiais porosos met\u00e1licos, polim\u00e9ricos ou cer\u00e2micos. \nPara materiais met\u00e1licos sinterizados, diversos arranjos de materiais e \nestruturas t\u00eam sido testados, visando aumentar a capacidade de troca \nt\u00e9rmica do dispositivo. A grande dificuldade no emprego de materiais \nmet\u00e1licos como o cobre \u00e9 a possibilidade de se formar vapor no interior \ndo meio poroso, bloqueando o fluxo de fluido de trabalho pelo \ndispositivo, causado pela elevada condutividade t\u00e9rmica do elemento \nporoso. Associada ao uso de materiais porosos sinterizados de cobre, \u00e9 \nusada \u00e1gua como fluido de trabalho, por sua compatibilidade qu\u00edmica e \npelo maior n\u00famero de m\u00e9rito dentre os fluidos de trabalho m\u00e3os \ncomuns. Por\u00e9m, a \u00e1gua apresenta uma varia\u00e7\u00e3o muito baixa da press\u00e3o \nde satura\u00e7\u00e3o com rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 temperatura, de forma que deve-se projetar \nevaporadores com pequenas perdas de carga e m\u00ednima transfer\u00eancia de \ncalor parasita para a c\u00e2mara de compensa\u00e7\u00e3o. Se uma quantidade \nconsider\u00e1vel de vapor \u00e9 produzida na c\u00e2mara de compensa\u00e7\u00e3o, este \npermanece confinado, bloqueando total ou parcialmente o fluxo de \nfluido de trabalho, impedindo o fluxo de vapor no canal do evaporador e \no retorno do condensado para a regi\u00e3o de bombeamento capilar e, \nconsequentemente, aumentando a resist\u00eancia t\u00e9rmica total do \ndispositivo. Nesse trabalho foi realizada uma an\u00e1lise te\u00f3rica e \nexperimental da transfer\u00eancia de calor e massa em meios porosos \nsinterizados, considerando-se mudan\u00e7a de fase do fluido de trabalho no \nevaporador de tubos de calor em circuito. Modelos matem\u00e1ticos para as \npropriedades termof\u00edsicas dos meios sinterizados de cobre, empregados \n\n\n\nno evaporador de um LHP, foram propostos e comparados com dados \nexperimentais. Nesta an\u00e1lise, foram estudados os par\u00e2metros \ngeom\u00e9tricos cr\u00edticos para o projeto de um evaporador para um tubo de \ncalor em circuito, considerando-se como par\u00e2metro de entrada as \ncaracter\u00edsticas geom\u00e9tricas do material particulado utilizado na \nfabrica\u00e7\u00e3o da estrutura capilar do meio poroso sinterizado do tubo de \ncalor em circuito, assim como a temperatura de opera\u00e7\u00e3o e a massa de \nfluido de trabalho. \n \nPalavras-chave: tubo de calor em circuito, projeto de meios porosos \nsinterizados, controle t\u00e9rmico de dispositivos eletr\u00f4nicos, modelagem \nmatem\u00e1tica. \n  \n\n\n\n \n \n\nABSTRACT \n \n\nTechnology advances in microelectronic systems lead to the \ndevelopment of high speed processing, with microprocessors of smaller \nsizes, which are ever lighter and faster. Conversely, these advances lead \nto the increase of the heat flux dissipation requirements. In this context, \nhighly conductive heat transfer devices, able to remove the generated \nheat from electronic components, are required. Among these devices, \nheat pipes and loop heat pipes (LHP) are increasingly considered for the \nthermal management of electronic components. In aeronautics, where \nthe use of electronic components has increased in the last decade, the \nheat pipes and loop heat pipes (LHP) are progressively being considered \nfor thermal control due to the capacity to transfer large amount of heat, \nthrough short to considerable long distances, without the use of \nmechanical pumps or refrigeration systems. The wick structures that \nconstitute these devices are basically made from metal, polymer or \nceramic sintered porous media. Several arrangements have been tested \nfor metal sintered porous media, in order to increase the heat transfer \ncapacity of the LHP. The main concern of using copper is the possibility \nof blockage of the working fluid flow within the LHP, due to the \npresence of vapor inside the wick. Actually, due to the high thermal \nconductivity of porous media, vapor can be formed inside the wick, \nremaining confined, which can block fully or partially the working fluid \npassage along the evaporator. Associated with copper sintered porous \nmedia, water is selected as the working fluid due to its chemical \ncompatibility with the copper and due to its large figure of merit in \ncomparison to other working fluids. However, water presents a low \nvariation of the saturation pressure as a function of temperature. This \ncharacteristic requires the design of evaporators with minimum pressure \ndrop and minimum parasitic heat flows (heat leak) to the compensation \nchamber. Actually, an undesired heat leak to the evaporator \ncompensation chamber may produce vapor, which may remain confined, \nfully or partially blocking the working fluid flow, and, consequently, \nincreasing the total thermal resistance of the device. In this work, \ntheoretical and experimental heat and mass transfer analyses of a copper \nsintered porous media, considering working fluid phase change, in a \nLHP evaporator, is developed. Mathematical models for the \nthermophysical properties of the copper sintered porous media were \nproposed and compared with experimental data. Analyses were \nperformed on critical geometry parameters to LHP design, which \n\n\n\nincludes the geometry characteristics of the powder used in the sintered \nporous media fabrication, as well as the operating temperature and the \nworking fluid mass. \n\n \nKeywords: Loop heat pipes, sintered porous media design tool, \nelectronics thermal control, mathematical modeling. \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n\nRESUMO EXPANDIDO \n \n \n\nAN\u00c1LISE DA TRANSFER\u00caNCIA DE CALOR E MASSA EM UM \nTUBO DE CALOR EM CIRCUITO EM COBRE  \n\n \n\nIntrodu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nOs Tubos de Calor em Circuito (Loop Heat Pipes - LHP) e os \nCircuitos de Bomba Capilar (Capillary Pumped Loops - CPL) s\u00e3o \ndispositivos utilizados para transporte eficiente de calor. Uma de suas \nprincipais aplica\u00e7\u00f5es est\u00e1 no controle de temperatura de equipamentos \neletr\u00f4nicos, especialmente os localizados em sat\u00e9lites e aeronaves. \nAmbos s\u00e3o considerados varia\u00e7\u00f5es da tecnologia dos tubos de calor \ncl\u00e1ssicos, onde as regi\u00f5es do evaporador e do condensador s\u00e3o \nseparadas, hidraulicamente conectadas por pares de tubos, por onde \ncircula apenas ou vapor ou l\u00edquido condensado. O bombeamento \npromovido pela estrutura capilar desloca o fluido de trabalho atrav\u00e9s do \ndispositivo e o vapor \u00e9 transportado para a regi\u00e3o do sumidouro de calor \n(condensador). As bombas capilares, que s\u00e3o estruturas respons\u00e1veis \npelo bombeamento capilar do fluido de trabalho em LHPs, s\u00e3o \nfabricadas basicamente a partir de materiais porosos met\u00e1licos, \npolim\u00e9ricos ou cer\u00e2micos. Por\u00e9m, em estruturas capilares met\u00e1licas, \npode haver bloqueio do fluxo de fluido de trabalho atrav\u00e9s do meio \nporoso no interior do sistema de bombeamento capilar, devido \u00e0 \nforma\u00e7\u00e3o indesej\u00e1vel de vapor no seu interior. Na realidade, deseja-se \nque a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de vapor ocorra em regi\u00f5es pr\u00f3ximas \u00e0s paredes das \nbombas capilares, o qual deve escoar por ranhuras localizadas nesta \nregi\u00e3o e projetadas para este fim. Por\u00e9m, se o elemento poroso tem \nelevada condutividade t\u00e9rmica, pode-se formar vapor no interior deste \nmeio, permanecendo confinado e bloqueando total ou parcialmente o \nfluxo do fluido de trabalho. Neste caso, o fluxo de vapor atrav\u00e9s do \ncanal do evaporador \u00e9 prejudicado, assim como o retorno do condensado \npara a regi\u00e3o de bombeamento capilar. Desta forma, a resist\u00eancia \nt\u00e9rmica total do dispositivo aumenta sensivelmente. Quanto menor o \ndispositivo, mais importante se torna este efeito. \n\nA capacidade de transportar calor est\u00e1 diretamente relacionada \n\u00e0 efici\u00eancia da estrutura porosa em proporcionar o transporte do fluido \nde trabalho, a qual por sua vez, depende da geometria do evaporador e \nde sua estrutura porosa. Neste contexto, modelos matem\u00e1ticos, capazes \n\n\n\nde predizer o comportamento t\u00e9rmico e hidr\u00e1ulico de bombas capilares, \nforam desenvolvidos nesta tese para o projeto de dispositivos eficientes. \n\nPropriedades como condutividade t\u00e9rmica efetiva e \npermeabilidade do meio poroso est\u00e3o intrinsicamente ligadas tanto aos \nlimites de opera\u00e7\u00e3o quanto \u00e0s respostas t\u00e9rmica e hidr\u00e1ulica dos LHPs. \nNesta tese tamb\u00e9m foram desenvolvidos modelos matem\u00e1ticos que \nrelacionam propriedades importantes do meio poroso, tais como: \ncondutividade t\u00e9rmica efetiva, porosidade, permeabilidade, etc., com o \ndi\u00e2metro da part\u00edcula do p\u00f3 de cobre utilizado na fabrica\u00e7\u00e3o do meio \nporoso da bomba capilar. A curva de aquecimento empregada no \nprocesso de sinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 um par\u00e2metro de entrada nestes \nmodelos. \n\nFinalmente, baseado nas ferramentas te\u00f3ricas desenvolvidas na \ntese, foram projetados, constru\u00eddos e testados dois tubos de calor em \ncircuito. Os resultados experimentais apresentaram boa compara\u00e7\u00e3o com \nas predi\u00e7\u00f5es dos modelos desenvolvidos nesta tese. \n\n \n\nObjetivo \n\nO principal objetivo desta tese \u00e9 desenvolver uma an\u00e1lise te\u00f3rica e \nexperimental da transfer\u00eancia de calor e massa no evaporador de um \ntubo de calor em circuito, cuja estrutura porosa foi fabricada a partir de \np\u00f3 de cobre sinterizado, considerando-se mudan\u00e7a de fase no interior da \nestrutura e um fluido que satura o meio. \n\n \n\nMetodologia \n\nEsta tese est\u00e1 estruturada da forma apresentada a seguir. \nInicialmente s\u00e3o apresentados os princ\u00edpios f\u00edsicos fundamentais que \n\nregem o funcionamento de tubos de calor em circuito (LHPs). S\u00e3o \ndiscutidas as compatibilidades entre materiais e fluido de trabalho, \nassim como as condi\u00e7\u00f5es termodin\u00e2micas de opera\u00e7\u00e3o. Posteriormente, \numa descri\u00e7\u00e3o do processo de sinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o dos meios porosos estudados \n\u00e9 apresentada. Amostras de p\u00f3s de cobre met\u00e1licos que apresentam \ndiferentes tamanhos de part\u00edculas, obtidas pelo processo de \npeneiramento de um p\u00f3 de cobre comercial, foram empregadas na \nfabrica\u00e7\u00e3o da estrutura sinterizada. Modelos matem\u00e1ticos para a \ncondutividade t\u00e9rmica efetiva, permeabilidade e do raio efetivo do poro \ndo meio poroso sinterizado s\u00e3o propostos. Bancadas experimentais e \nequipamentos de medi\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o empregados para avaliar as propriedades \n\n\n\n \n \n\nestudas e os resultados s\u00e3o comprados com os modelos experimentais \ndesenvolvidos.  \n\nNa segunda parte, foca-se na modelagem t\u00e9rmica e hidr\u00e1ulica do \nevaporador e do LHP. Foi proposta uma express\u00e3o para calcular a \nrela\u00e7\u00e3o cr\u00edtica entre a espessura e o comprimento da camada de estrutura \nporosa no evaporador.   \n\nA descri\u00e7\u00e3o e a an\u00e1lise do procedimento de projeto do evaporador do \nLHP, com base nos modelos desenvolvidos s\u00e3o apresentadas. Um \nmodelo matem\u00e1tico acoplado para determinar os campos da temperatura \ne da press\u00e3o \u00e9 desenvolvido. As solu\u00e7\u00f5es anal\u00edticas das equa\u00e7\u00f5es de \nconserva\u00e7\u00e3o de massa, momento e energia utilizando o m\u00e9todo de \nsepara\u00e7\u00e3o de vari\u00e1veis s\u00e3o obtidas e a taxa de calor transferida para a \nc\u00e2mara de compensa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 calculada a partir de um balan\u00e7o energ\u00e9tico \nrealizado sobre o modelo f\u00edsico proposto. Baseados nos modelos \ndesenvolvidos, dois LHPs foram projetados e constru\u00eddos para trabalhar \ncom \u00e1gua e metanol, respectivamente. Uma bancada experimental para \navaliar o desempenho dos LHPs projetados \u00e9 apresentada e os dados \nexperimentais obtidos s\u00e3o comparados com as predi\u00e7\u00f5es dos modelos. \n\n \n\nConclus\u00f5es \n\nNeste trabalho, foram desenvolvidos modelos para a previs\u00e3o \nda distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de temperatura e press\u00e3o do material poroso usado como \nestrutura capilar, para um evaporador de LHP de forma cil\u00edndrica. O \nestudo da estrutura porosa do evaporador nesta tese \u00e9 composto por uma \nzona ativa de evapora\u00e7\u00e3o, isto \u00e9, um cilindro oco onde o calor da fonte \nde calor \u00e9 transferido para a superf\u00edcie de evapora\u00e7\u00e3o (menisco) e outro \ncilindro s\u00f3lido que separa a c\u00e2mara de compensa\u00e7\u00e3o da a zona de \nevapora\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nModelos matem\u00e1ticos para a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de temperatura, \nconsiderando geometria bidimensional (2D) e unidimensional (1D), \nforam desenvolvidos. Para o modelo de press\u00e3o, foi utilizada apenas \numa abordagem bidimensional (2D). Os modelos t\u00e9rmico e de press\u00e3o \n2D, acoplados, permitem a determina\u00e7\u00e3o dos par\u00e2metros da geometria \nque garantem o desempenho correto do evaporador, isto \u00e9, sem a \nforma\u00e7\u00e3o de bolhas de vapor dentro dos meios porosos. Deste estudo \nobservou-se que os modelos 2D s\u00e3o ferramentas \u00fateis para o projeto da \nestrutura porosa do evaporador do LHP, capazes de garantir um modo \nde opera\u00e7\u00e3o seguro. No entanto, o modelo t\u00e9rmico 2D n\u00e3o considera a \n\n\n\nperda de calor atrav\u00e9s da parede do evaporador, apenas atrav\u00e9s da \nestrutura porosa com a c\u00e2mara de compensa\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n\nCom base nos resultados 2D, que mostraram um \ncomportamento muito pr\u00f3ximo a fen\u00f4menos unidimensionais, tanto de \ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o de temperatura quanto de press\u00e3o, foi desenvolvido um \nmodelo t\u00e9rmico 1D. Embora muito simples, este modelo, que faz uso da \nanalogia entre circuito t\u00e9rmico e el\u00e9trico e permite contabilizar as perdas \nde calor do evaporador para a c\u00e2mara de compensa\u00e7\u00e3o e para a parede \ndo evaporador, capturando o comportamento t\u00e9rmico real do \nevaporador. A distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de temperatura ao longo do condensador do \nLHP tamb\u00e9m foi obtida a partir deste modelo. Complementando a \nmodelagem de um LHP, modelos de perda de press\u00e3o para fluidos, tanto \nmonof\u00e1sicos como de duas fases, tamb\u00e9m foram usados nas linhas de \nl\u00edquido, de vapor e no condensador. \n\nOs campos de temperatura e press\u00e3o mostram que a interface \nentre o cilindro s\u00f3lido e oco \u00e9 a regi\u00e3o cr\u00edtica a ser controlada para \ngarantir o perfeito funcionamento do LHP, uma vez que, quando a carga \nde calor \u00e9 aumentada, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel que temperaturas superiores \u00e0s cr\u00edticas \nsejam atingidas, formando assim vapor e reduzindo a taxa de \ntransfer\u00eancia de calor, aumentando consequentemente a queda de \npress\u00e3o no interior da estrutura porosa do evaporador. Assim, avaliou-se \na possibilidade de forma\u00e7\u00e3o de bolhas no interior da estrutura porosa, \nem termos de temperatura e press\u00e3o, comparando estas condi\u00e7\u00f5es com \num crit\u00e9rio de para determinar a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de bolhas dentro da estrutura \ncapilar (estudos de ebuli\u00e7\u00e3o). \n\nUma express\u00e3o te\u00f3rica do par\u00e2metro de projeto de estruturas \nporosas, que determina condi\u00e7\u00f5es satisfat\u00f3rias de opera\u00e7\u00e3o do \nevaporador do LHP, ?/l (espessura/comprimento do evaporador), a qual \nrelaciona as propriedades termodin\u00e2micas do fluido de trabalho com as \npropriedades termof\u00edsicas dos meios porosos, foi proposta para a \ndetermina\u00e7\u00e3o da espessura do evaporador. Dois LHPs foram projetados \ne fabricados para avaliar este crit\u00e9rio te\u00f3rico: um para operar com \u00e1gua e \noutro para operar com metanol. Os testes com os LHPs fabricados \nvalidaram o par\u00e2metro cr\u00edtico, mostrando que a equa\u00e7\u00e3o proposta pode \nser usada como ferramenta para a determina\u00e7\u00e3o da espessura do meio \nporoso em um LHP. \n\nPara a concep\u00e7\u00e3o de um meio poroso sinterizado com \npropriedades desej\u00e1veis (porosidade, permeabilidade, raio efetivo do \nporo e condutividade t\u00e9rmica efetiva), foram propostos modelos, onde o \npar\u00e2metro de entrada \u00e9 o di\u00e2metro m\u00e9dio de part\u00edcula utilizadas na \nfabrica\u00e7\u00e3o do meio poroso sinterizado. O processo de sinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o foi \n\n\n\n \n \n\ndescrito utilizando modelos da literatura. Foi desenvolvido uma bancada \nexperimental para medir as propriedades termof\u00edsicas e os dados obtidos \nforam comparados com valores te\u00f3ricos, mostrando uma boa \ncompara\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nFoi feita uma an\u00e1lise estat\u00edstica para determinar o efeito \nprincipal dos par\u00e2metros geom\u00e9tricos e da condutividade t\u00e9rmica efetiva \nsobre a resposta t\u00e9rmica da geometria de estrutura porosa proposta nesta \ntese.

Conversely, these advances lead to the increase of the \nrate of heat dissipation per volume. Therefore, most of this thermal \npower must be removed to keep the operating temperatures within safe \nlevels. In this context, high performance heat transfer devices, able to \nremove the excess of heat from electronic components, are required. \nAmong others, heat pipes and related technologies have been \nincreasingly considered for the thermal management of electronic \ndevices for terrestrial and space applications.  \n\nAeronautics is one area where the use of heat pipe technologies has \naugmented in the last decade, in modern airplanes are increasingly \nelectric/electronic. Heat pipes and loop heat pipes (LHP) are gradually \nbeing considered for the thermal control of aircraft guidance and control \nelectronic systems as well as for passenger amusement devices (e.g. \nvideo, internet, telephone, etc.).  \n\nActually, heat pipes, and other related technologies, are able to \ntransfer large amount of heat through short to considerable long \ndistances, without the use of mechanical pumps or refrigeration systems, \nwhich could produce undesirable vibrations and maintenance. \n\nLoop Heat Pipes can be considered a variation of the classic heat \npipes. Their major characteristic is the separation between the \nevaporator and the condenser sections that are connected by tubes that \nconducts or liquid (condensate) or vapor. Figure 1 shows a schematic of \nthe operation of a LHP, with a cylindrical evaporator and a finned tube \ncondenser.  \n\n \nFigure 1 - Scheme of operation of a Loop Heat Pipe. \n\n \nWhen heat is supplied to the evaporator, the working fluid within \n\nthis region, which is in saturating condition, changes of phase from \nliquid to vapor and the resulting vapor flows to the condenser through a \n\n\n\n40 \n \n\nvapor line. In the condenser, the heat is reject and the vapor changes \nphase from vapor to liquid and the condensate is conducted back to the \nevaporator through a liquid line, which, in turn, is connected to the \ncompensation chamber (liquid reservoir attached to the evaporator) and, \nfinally, to the evaporator, closing the loop. \n\nThe wick structure located in the evaporator provides the capillary \npressure to pump the working fluid along the LHP. These capillary \nstructures can be made from metal, polymer or ceramic materials. \nMaydanik et al. (2011b) show that LHPs in which wick structure is \nmade of copper and water is the working fluid, achieved the highest \ncapacity of heat power transfer. However, especially for this specific \ncombination of materials, the design and fabrication of the evaporator \nwicks represent a challenge to the engineers, researchers and \nmanufacturers. Due to the high thermal conductivity of porous media, \nvapor can be formed inside the wick, remaining fully or partially \nconfined, blocking the working fluid inside the evaporator, resulting in \nthe dry out of the LHP. In addition, an undesired heat leak from \nevaporator to the compensation chamber may increase the temperature \nand pressure of the working fluid, causing the collapse of the device. \nBesides, as the water presents high latent heat and high surface tension, \na low variation of temperature can affect the pressure level of the \nworking fluid, preventing the start-up of the device.  \n\nActually, the heat transferred to the wick structure caused the \nworking fluid phase change. To keep the structure full of liquid, the \nevaporated mass must be replenished by the porous media. Therefore, \nthe capillary structure must have both characteristics: enough capillary \npressure to guarantee the fluid pumping over the whole loop and enough \npermeability to allow the liquid to flow through the evaporator. \nStructures with small pores have high capacity of capillary pumping but \nreduced permeability. Overall parameters such as effective thermal \nconductivity, permeability and effective porous radius can predict the \nresponse of the wick structure for heat and mass transfer. One process \nused to manufacture these media is sintering of metallic powder. In this \nprocess, necks are formed among the contact points of the particles, \nproviding the bonding among the particles, responsible for the \nmechanical and geometric characteristics of the wick. Also, through \nthese necks, heat is conducted along the media. Therefore, the geometry \nof necks involves important parameters that depend on the media \nsintering temperature and on the size of the powder particles.  \n\nAt this point, the following question arises: what is the best \nevaporator design that guarantees the performance of a LHP? The \n\n\n\n41 \n \n\n \n \n\ndesign procedure must involve transport phenomena models (heat and \nmass transfer) and the selection of geometry of the wick structure. The \nresulting evaporator must satisfy the application requirements \n(temperature, geometry and heat transport capacity) and should \nguarantee that the device is able to transport the desired heat. This \nmeans that the evaporator must operate within its heat transfer limits, \navoiding dry out. Models to be used as tools for the evaporator design \nshould satisfy the first law of thermodynamic and so, must include the \nthermodynamic state of the working fluid. A global design scheme of an \nefficient LHP evaporator tool must contain the necessary models and \ntheir interactions with the operation requirements, including heat \ntransfer limits and thermodynamic conditions, as presented in Figure 2.  \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 - Summary of the design of a LHP evaporator. \n \n\nIn this work, a simple geometry, easy to fabricate LHP is proposed. \nTheoretical and experimental heat and mass transfer models of a copper \nsintered porous media located in a LHP evaporator is developed. As a \nresult, the critical design parameters of a LHP evaporator, including \ncharacteristics of the powder geometry, used in the fabrication of the \nwick structure, are determined. Through the characteristics of the \nmetallic powder used, the thermophysical properties of the sintered \nporous media can be controlled. The performance of fabricated LHPs is \ncompared with predictions of heat and mass transfer mathematical \n\n\n\n42 \n \n\nmodels which input parameters are the thermodynamic properties of \nLHP component materials.  \n\nThe first main focus of this thesis is on the analytical modelling the \ngeometry characterization of the evaporator porous media, including the \ndetermination of the effective thermal conductivity, permeability and \neffective porous radius. Mathematical models are proposed to determine \nthe thermophysical properties of the wick, taking the mean diameter of \npowder particles and the neck radius as the controlling parameters. The \noutput of these models works as input of the thermal and hydrodynamic \nmodels that describe the thermal behavior of LHP evaporators.  \n\nTherefore, the second model is focused on analytical models, based \non the conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy, which \nwere developed for prediction of temperature and pressure fields within \nthe porous media of the evaporator. Thermodynamic equilibrium \nrelations are used to couple all the elements of the LHP studied. The \nobjective of this model is to provide a tool for the design of evaporators \nof loop heat pipes able to transport the desired heat power at the desired \ntemperature level. \n\nFinally, based on the theoretical tools developed along the thesis, a \nLHP was designed, constructed and tested. The testing results were \ncompared with the predictions from the model.  \n\n \n1.1 Objectives \n\n \n1.1.1 General Objective \n\n \nThe main objective of this thesis is to perform a theoretical and \n\nexperimental analysis of the heat and mass transfer of a LHP evaporator, \nwhich wick is made of sintering copper powder, considering phase \nchange that happens within the porous media, considered saturated with \nworking fluid.  \n\n \n1.1.2 Specific Objectives \n \n\nIn order to reach the general objective, the following specific \nobjectives are proposed.  \n\n\u2022 To characterize the copper sintered porous media made from \npower with narrow distribution size particle. \n\n\u2022 To determine the characteristic parameters of the powder \nused in the fabrication of the sintered porous media, to be \nused as wick structure of LHP evaporator.  \n\n\n\n43 \n \n\n \n \n\n\u2022 To develop a model able to predict the permeability, the \neffective thermal conductivity and the effective porous \nradius of the resulting porous media, which input parameter \nis the average diameter of the powder particle. \n\n\u2022 To develop a mathematical model for predicting the heat \nand mass transfer within the wick structure of the LHP \nevaporator. \n\n\u2022 To determine the critical geometry parameters for the design \nof the LHP evaporator. \n\n\u2022 To design a LHP using the models and theoretical tools \ndeveloped in this thesis. \n\n\u2022 To evaluate the temperature of operation and the heat \ntransfer capacity of a LHP designed, using the sintered \nporous media with controlled properties. \n\n \n1.2 Thesis Organization  \n\n \nThis work is presented as follows.  \n \nIn chapter 1, a brief introduction of the present thesis subject and the \n\nobjectives of the present work are presented. \nIn chapter 2, to introduce the subject of the present investigation, the \n\nLHP working principles are presented, as well as the physical \ncharacterization of the materials and the fluid used and their operating \nthermodynamic conditions. \n\nIn chapter 3, the descriptions of porous media and sintering \nprocesses are presented.

More detailed literature \nreviews will be presented along the other chapters. \n\n \n2.1  Heat pipes \n \n\nHeat pipes (HPs) are devices with high capacity to transfer thermal \nenergy, also known as \u201cheat super conductors\u201d. These devices utilize the \nphase change of a working fluid to transfer heat from a source, like an \nelectronic chip, transistor or computer processing unit, to a sink, such as \nthe ambient, a fin-arrangement heat sink assisted by a fan, etc. Heat \npipes are composed of a metallic case, internally lined with a porous \nmedia layer, which is filled with a working fluid. Heat Pipe is divided in \nthree sections: evaporator, adiabatic and condenser (see Figure 3). When \nheat is supplied to the evaporator, the working fluid changes of phase. \nThis vapor flows to the condenser through the internal channel. In the \ncondenser section, heat is rejected and the saturated vapor within this \nsection, changes of phase and the condensate flows through porous \nmedia back to the evaporator. Capillary pumping provides the driving \nforce necessary to the condensate fluid to return to the evaporator. The \ncapillary structure responsible for the working fluid pumping from \ncondenser to evaporator, can be made from sintered porous media, \nmetallic meshes or grooves.  \n\nPaiva and Mantelli (2015) developed and modeled mathematically a \nHP composed by diffusion welding of a sandwich of several parallel \ncopper wires between two flat plates. Paiva and Mantelli (2015) \nproposed other more efficient design, using sintered porous media in the \nevaporator and copper wire flat plates in the adiabatic and condenser \nsections. This hybrid configuration increased the heat transfer capacity \ncompared to sintered wick HPs. Operational tests in a notebook, assisted \nby this new technology HP, showed a reduction of 5.11 \u00b0C in the \ncomputer processor temperature, compared to the original device. \n\nThe volume of working fluid, inserted in a heat pipe, must be \nsufficient to saturate completely the capillary structure. Actually, high \ncapillary pumping is obtained with small wick porous. However, small \nporous increase the liquid pressure drop and decrease the capacity of the \nliquid to flow through the porous media. Therefore, there is an optimal \n\n\n\n46 \n \n\nwick design that combines high pumping capacity with pressure drop. \nFl\u00f3rez et al., (2012) fabricated and tested heat pipes using two layers of \ncopper powder sintered wick structures, increasing the device heat \ntransfer capacity. However, despite of the porous media improvements \nreported in the literature, the liquid pressure drop and the countercurrent \nliquid-vapor dragging forces limit the distance between evaporator and \ncondenser. Loop heat pipes (LHPs) are proposed as HP technology \nalternative solution to increase the distance between evaporator and \ncondenser. A description of the main principles of LHP operation is \npresented in the following section. \n\n \n\nFigure 3 - Scheme of operation of a heat pipe. \n \n2.2  Loop heat pipes \n \n\nLoop heat pipe (LHP) is a variation of classic HPs. The main \ncharacteristic is these devices lies in the separation between the \nevaporator and condenser sections, that are connected by tubes where \nvapor from the evaporator and condensate liquid from the condenser are \nseparately transported. In Figure 4, a flat plane evaporator LHP is \nshown. \n\nIn LHP, all the wick structure and therefore the pumping capacity of \nthe device is located in the evaporator. This gives a higher geometrical \nflexibility for device. The vapor produced in the evaporator, where heat \nis delivered, is transported to the condenser section by vapor tubes, with \na low level of perturbation. In the condenser section, in steady state \n\n\n\n47 \n \n\n \n \n\nconditions, all the heat transported is delivered to the heat sink. It must \nbe noted that the capillary structure across the entire extension of HPs \nactually limits the distance which the heat is able to be transported \nbetween the source and the sink. In LHPs, this distance can be increased \nand so the heat transport capacity. \n\n \nFigure 4 - Loop heat pipe. \n\n \nOne major characteristic for LHPs is the presence of a working fluid \n\nreservoir that ensures the constant supply of working fluid to the \ncapillary pumping system. This reservoir is located beside the \nevaporator section and is commonly denominated as \u201ccompensation \nchamber\u201d and, therefore, is joined thermally and hydraulic to the \nevaporator across a channel. LHP evaporator usually has geometry flat \nor cylindrical, as shown in Figure 5.  \n\n \n2.2.1 Working Fluid \n \n\nSeveral factors must be considered in the selection of the working \nfluid to be used in heat pipes and loop heat pipes. According to Peterson \n(1994a), the range of temperature, vapor pressure, thermal conductivity, \ncompatibly with material of wick structure, case, stability and toxicity \nare important aspects to be considered in the selection of the fluid in the \ndesign and fabrication stage. Reay and Kew (2006) presented data that \ndescribes the compatibility for same working fluid with different \nmaterials, typically used in heat pipes, which are summarized in Table \n2. By compatibility, one understands the chemical reaction among the \ncapillary structure, the casing material and the working fluid, which can \ncause the production of non-condensable gases. \n\n \n\n\n\n48 \n \n\na) \n\n \nb) \n\n \nFigure 5 - Evaporator geometry a) cylindrical, b) flat. \n\n \nTable 2.

Also, the mass of fluid \ncan be estimated at condition of the high temperature, using the \nequation:  \n \n\n \n? ? ??,? ????? ? ?? ? ?1 ? ???\n\n? ? ??,? ???? ? ???? ??\n\n? ? ??\n\n?, (2.2) \n\n \nwhere Vliq is the volume of liquid line, Vw is the porous volume of the \ncapillary structure, ?l,H  and ?v,H are the densities of liquid and vapor, ? is \nthe fraction of free volume (not filled with liquid) in the compensation \nchamber. Once ? e ? are properly selected, the volume of compensation \nchamber can be calculated. In extreme conditions, LHP have to contain \nthe amount of fluid equivalent to volume of liquid at maximum \ntemperature in which the device starts the operation. This is mass can be \ncalculated by:  \n \n\n ? ? ??,!?\" ???\n\n? ? ?\n\n ?, (2.3) \n \nwhere ?l,max is the density of liquid at maximum LHP operation \ntemperature. In literature, the LHP liquid load is related to its total \nvolume. Singh et al., (2009) tested a LHP with flat evaporator that \noperated normally with a working fluid volume ranging between 50 % \nand 80 % of the total volume of the device. The LHP presented dry out \nfor fluid load below 50 % and the active area of condenser was not \nenough to remove the heat for a fluid load above 80 %. \n \n2.2.2 Thermodynamic process \n \n\nThe thermodynamic states of the working fluid within a LHP can be \nrepresented in a pressure-temperature (PT) and pressure-specific volume \ndiagram (Pv), as shown in Figure 6a and 6b, respectively. In the \nevaporator, the liquid evaporates at the meniscus (1). Actually, the \n\n\n\n50 \n \n\nliquid-vapor meniscus, formed in the external surface of the wick \nstructure, provides the capillary pressure drop, represented by the \npressure difference between points (8) and (1) (Figure 6a), responsible \nfor the liquid pumping along the LHP. The resulting vapor (2), which is \nin the superheated state, leaves the evaporator and flows through the \nvapor line duct (2-3). Also, the tube temperature levels decrease if the \nduct loses heat to the ambient. This happens if the tube external wall is \nnot well thermally insulated and the ambient temperature is lower than \nthe tube temperature. At point (3), vapor enters the condenser where \nheat is removed. Phase change starts when the vapor saturation state \ntemperature is achieved. This is supposed to happen in the first section \nof the condenser (4-5). When the liquid leaves the condenser (6), the \nliquid is subcooled. Then, the condensate liquid flows through the liquid \nline and enters the compensation chamber (7). Then, the liquid flows \nthrough the porous structure (8) where it warms up, due to the heat input \nin the evaporator, reaching the liquid-vapor interface (1) in the \nmeniscus, in the saturate conditions, closing the cycle. The fluid \ntransportation within vapor and liquid lines generates pressure drops. A \nschematic representation of the LHP operation is shown in Figure 6c. \n\nWhen the liquid reaches the liquid-vapor interface (8), the liquid is at \nthe saturation pressure, corresponding to the local evaporator \ntemperature. Actually, the heat transferred through the wick structure \nsolid matrix is the responsible for the working fluid phase change. \nTherefore, saturation states 7 and 8 are thermodynamically linked and \nmust satisfy the following equation (FAGHRI, 1995; KU, 1999; \nMAYDANIK et al., 2011): \n\n \n ?$ ? %&amp;%'(' ?), (2.4) \n\nwhich also can be written as: \n \n\n &amp;*+&amp;,,'*+',, ? %&amp;%'(',, , (2.5) \n \nwhere Pv and Tv are the pressure and temperature of the evaporator, \nwhile Pcc and Tcc are pressure and temperature of the compensation \nchamber, respectively. The term dP/dT is the slope of the pressure-\ntemperature saturation line at Tcc and this rate depends on the working \nfluid.  \n\n \n\n\n\n51 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n52 \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6 - a) Pressure-temperature diagram of LHP, b) Pressure- specific \nvolume diagram, c) Schematic representation LHP operation. \n\n \n2.3  Conclusions \n\n \nIn this chapter, the physical phenomena that drive the heat transport \n\ncapacity of HP and LHP were presented. The understanding of the \nworking principles is fundamental for the several models developed and \npresented in the subsequent chapters of this thesis.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n53 \n \n\n \n \n\n3 CHARACTERIZATION OF SINTERED POROUS MEDIA: \nMODEL AND DATA \n \n\n In the present thesis, sintered porous media are used as capillary \nstructures in the fabrication of the evaporator in LHP. This structure \nprovides higher capillary pump that usual mesh or grooved wick \nstructures. In this chapter, an analysis of the fundamental parameters \ninvolved in sintered wick fabrication process as well as the effective \nthermophysical properties of the resulting porous media will be present. \nThe study is focus on wick structures obtained using copper powder. \nEach subsection is formed of an introduction where definitions and \nliterature review is presented. Consistently, a mathematical model is \nproposed with the objective of relate the properties study with the mean \nparticle diameter as parameter of enter. Experimental setups fabricated \nand used in the measured of each property also are descripted. Finally, \nthe results and conclusions are discussed, both proposed, and literature \nmodels are compared with experimental data. \n \n3.1 Sintered process \n \n\nSintering is one of the techniques used to process particulate \nmaterials, aiming among other purposes, the fabrication of porous \nmedia. Th\u00fcmmler and Oberacker (1993) describe the sintering as \nthermally activated material transport, which happens in a bulk of \ncompacted powder, where the specific surface area is reduced by the \ngrowth of the contact between the particles. The neck size depends on \nparameters such as: rate of heating, time, temperature of sintering, \nparticle material and mechanisms of mass transport.  \n\nThe grain growth and the densification occur by means of the mass \ntransport mechanism. Swinkels and Ashby (1981) divide the sintering \nprocess according to the transport mechanisms: surface diffusion, \ndiffusion in the grain boundary and evaporation (see Figure 7). The \ngrain boundary diffusion occurs due to defects in grain (vacancies, gaps \nand inconsistencies). According to these same authors, these transport \nmechanisms contribute to the growth of the neck but only the boundary \nand lattice diffusion contribute to the densification of the material. The \nsintering process can be divided in the following stages: formation and \ngrowth of the necks, densification and particulate material grain growth. \nTh\u00fcmmler and Oberacker (1993) state that micro welding in the \ncontacting areas within particulates form micro bridges (necks), which \n\n\n\n54 \n \n\nsize depends on the compression pressure. During the sintering, the \nshape of the sintered material does not change very much after \ncompression. \n\n \n\nFigure 7 - Mass transport mechanism in sintering process. \n \nAshby (1981) affirms that the superficial diffusion is the dominant \n\nmechanism for copper powder sintering and propose the following \nexpression to determine the neck growing rate, given by ?? :  \n\n \n ?? ? 2./ ?/ 0/ ?23 ) 456 (3.1) \n\n \nwhere \n \n\n ./ ? ?/.\n/ 7+89:; (3.2) \n \nand where ?s is surface energy, Ds is surface diffusion coefficient, Dos is \nthe coefficient of the superficial diffusion, Qs is energy of activation of \nthe superficial diffusion, ?s is effective superficial thickness, ? is the \natomic volume, 23  is the constant of Stefan-Boltzmann and T is \ntemperature. df is considered as the driving force of the sintering process \nand can be calculated from the expression: \n \n\n 45 ?&lt;= 1>! ? 1?? ? 2>@ A1 ? ?> B (3.3) \n  \nThe factor (1-x/r) is inserted to guarantee the validity of the model when \nthe value of x approaches the sphere radius (ASHBY, 1981). An \n\n\n\n55 \n \n\n \n \n\nexpression relating the meniscus radius (neck curvature, rn), the radius \nof spherical particles r and the neck radius x is:  \n \n\n >! ? 12 ?C1 ? ? (3.4) \n \n3.2  Porosity \n\n \n This section presents a mathematical model that relate the sintered \nporous media porosity with the particle average diameters and sintering \ntemperatures, aiming its application in the design of capillary structures \nfor heat pipes and loop heat pipes. Copper is the material employed in \nthe present study, as it has been used as a typical wick material due to its \ngood chemical compatibility with water (probably the most used \nworking fluid in heat pipes) and due to the facility of manufacturing.  \n The literature recognizes that the porosity is an important parameter \nfor modeling and designing heat pipes and loop heat pipes (FAGHRI, \n1995; FLOREZ; NUERNBERG; PAIVA, 2012; MAYDANIK et al., \n2011; PETERSON; 1994) and usually links porosity with the effective \nthermal conductivity and permeability, especially for sintered porous \nmedia (ATABAKI; BALIGA, 2007). \n Powder, with disperse particle size distribution, were separated \nthrough successive sieving to obtain narrow bands of particle sizes. \nSeveral sintered porous media made from these powders were fabricated \nand the porosity measured. The circularity of particles was measured to \nevaluate the influence of particle shapes in the resulting porous media. \nExperimental data is used in the comparison with the theoretical models. \n \n3.2.1 Physical model \n \n\nThe powder particles from which the porous media is made are \nmodeled as spheres of uniform radius r. Several packing configurations \ncan be observed, when the same diameter spheres are in contact. In \nFigure 8, four packing configurations according to German (1989), are \npresented. These arrangements are employed to determine the \ntheoretical porosity of a sintered porous media. The porosity is defined \nas the ratio between the empty volume (voids) and the total volume of a \ntridimensional box unit cell. The unit cell represents the particle packing \nand voids throughout the porous media for regular packing \n\n\n\n56 \n \n\narrangements. The unit cell edge corresponds to the line connecting the \ncenter of two adjacent spheres. In some arrangements, a sphere can be \nallocated in the center of the box. The spherical particles are \nmechanically bounded by means of a neck formed during the sintering \nprocess. The number of contact points in the box is determined \naccording to neighbor spheres and depends on the packing arrangement \nconsidered. The edge angles of the \u201cunit cell box\u201d faces are represented \nin Figure 8. \n\n \n\nFigure 8 - Packing model.  a)Cubic, b)Orthorhombic, c)Tetragonal, \nd)Rhombohedric. \n\n \nThe following hypotheses were adopted: \n\n\u2022 Sintering process shrinkage is not considered. In the initial \nsintering stage, neck growth occurs and superficial mass \ndiffusion is the dominant mass transfer mechanism (KANG, \n2005). \n\n\u2022 The sintered porous media is considered isotropic; thus the \nporosity is the same in all directions. \n\n\u2022 Cubic packing scheme is adopted for modeling the porosity \n(Figure 8a). \n\n \n3.2.2 Mathematical model \n\n \nThe porosity is calculated as the ratio between the void and bulk \n\nvolumes of the unit cell. The void volume is calculated by subtracting \nfrom the volume of one cell, the volume corresponding to one sphere \n(two hemispheres) and half the volume of the necks (one neck for each \nsphere contact, according to packing scheme considered). Table 3 \npresents the literature expressions for the determination of the unit cell \nvolume for each packing arrangement and the number of contacting \nspheres. \n\n \n\na) b) c) d) \n\n\n\n57 \n \n\n \n \n\nTable 3.

This model can be adjusted by \nadding information of particle shape such as the circularly factor. The \npowder particle shape depends basically of the manufacture process. \nThe powder copper used in this work is obtained by atomization process \nin water. In this process, the particles obtained presents irregular form. \nImages obtained by electronic microscopy of the copper powder show \nthat smaller particles present circularly factor closed of 1 and decreases \nas size increases. \n \n3.2.3 Experimental procedure \n\n \nAtomized copper powder was employed during this study. Copper \n\nsintered porous media was selected as the object of the present study \ndue to its chemical compatibility with water and its facility of \nmanufacture as mentioned above. This material was employed in \nfabrication of samples, where the porosity and effective thermal \nconductivity were measured and presented in this study. Tests were \nconducted to determine the content of copper in the composition of the \nparticulate material and a percentage of 95.45 \u00b1 1 % of copper were \nobserved. According to the ASM (1990) tables for pure copper and its \nalloys, the composition of the powder is similar to the copper alloy \nC21000, which has the thermal conductivity of 234 W/(K?m) at 20 \u00b0C. \nPhysical properties of copper, provided by Swinkels and Ashby (1981) \nand shown in Table 4, where employed in the present work. \n\n\n\n59 \n \n\n \n \n\nParticles of different sizes were obtained from successive mechanical \nvibration siftings of atomized copper powder obtained in the market and \nknown commercially as PAM. The sieving process was conducted in \nequipment in batches with 300 g mass of powder PAM, during three \nhours. A set of sieves of mesh ASTM 100,150,250,275,300, 400 and \n500 were employed.  \n\nThe characterization of the particle size was made by laser \ngranulometry, using the Fraunhofer diffraction method and the \nequipment Mastersizer 2000. Figure 9 presents the particle size \ndistribution for PAM copper powder. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \nImage analyses was employed to determinate the porosity of each \n\nsample. The image processing can be basically separated into four steps: \nimage acquisition, preprocessing, segmentation, pattern recognition, and \nquantification. Mathematically, a monochrome digital image is \nrepresented by a function f(x,y) of luminous intensity of gray levels  of \neach point(pixel) image. The software counts the number of black (solid \nparticles) and white (voids) pixels, allowing the calculation of porosity, \naccording to the percentage area of each phase in the image. The \nsoftware ImagemJ\u00ae was used to determine the porosity.

Each sample was made using a loose powder \nsintering process. The sample was deposited inside a cast made by \nstainless steel 304, as cooper has no chemical interaction with stainless \nsteel, which facilitates the copper sample removal from the stainless \nsteel casing. The sintering process was conducted in a vacuum (0.1 Pa, \napproximately) furnace with a controlled atmosphere of commercial H2. \nThe heating rate was 5 K/min until the sintering temperature is \nachieved, in which level the samples stayed for more than 3000 s. The \nspecimens were embedded in acrylic resin by vacuum impregnation, to \npreserve the porous structure integrity. Without the impregnation \nprocess, the porous structure could be deformed, during the polishing \nstep. The porous media samples were submitted to a metallographic \nprocess, to get a flat surface free of scratches, so that the acquisition of \nappropriate images by optical microscopy (OM) was possible. Surface \nPreparation was performed in two operations, following the \nrecommendations of ASM (1990): rough polishing, where 400, 600, \n1200 and 4000 grit, with water as the vehicle and a wheel speed of \napproximately 200 rpm were employed; and finish polishing, where \nfiner alumina (Al2O3) 0.3-?m on napped cloths are used. After \npolishing, the specimen is rinsed in water and dried with warm air. This \nprocess was used to obtain a better digital image quality as surface \nscratches produce inaccuracies when porous media properties are \nmeasured employing image analysis. The digital image analysis was \nperformed with a reflected light microscope at the Characterization \nMaterials Laboratory (LCM/UFSC - Brazil). Digital images were taken \nfrom 20 different regions of each sample, using objective lenses at \nmagnifications of 50, 100 and 200 times. The measuring uncertainties \nwere calculated from the standard deviation of the 20 measurements. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10 - Measurement of porosity. a) Sintering sample. b) Optical \nmicroscopy image of powder PAM x200. c) Binary image. \n\n \n\n\n\n61 \n \n\n \n \n\n3.2.4 Results and conclusions \n \nFigure 11 presents the particle size distribution and the binary \n\nimages corresponding to each of the particles studied in this work. As \nalready mentioned, the size of the particles was obtained by sifting \natomized copper powder, resulting in particle sizes classified as A, B, C, \nD, E and F, in increasing mean particle diameter order. The Figure 11 x-\naxis represents the equivalent spherical diameter of particles (in \nmicrometers) and the y-axis represents the percentage (in volume) \nparticles corresponding to the x-axis entry. The distribution functions of \nall types of powder analyzed showed a similar behavior, following a \ntypical normal distribution. However, powder A presents a bimodal \ndistribution. Actually, the present paper authors believe that this effect is \ndue to the agglomeration of particles, as small particles present high free \nenergy due to the high superficial area in relation to its volume, which \nproduces particle cohesion. Figure 11 also presents, in the right side, \nbinary images of the porous media made of the powder characterized at \nthe left side. These images were obtained from an optical microscopic \nand processed by the software ImagenJ\u00ae. As already mentioned, in these \nimages, white represents the sintered powder and black the pores. \nBinary images show that increasing the particle diameter also increases \nthe porosity of sintered media. One should note that these media were \nsintered at a temperature of 850 \u00baC. \n\nFigure 12 presents a comparison between the experimental data and \nthe predictions of the porosity proposed model, considering the four-\npacking structure as shown in Figure 8, as a function of the particle \nmean diameter. One can note that the experimental porosity tends to an \napproximately constant value for particles of diameter larger than \n50 ?m. For porous media made from small particles (diameter smaller \nthan 50 ?m), the porosity decreases, reaching a value of 0.30. Form this \nfigure one can also note that the model based on sphere packing tends \nquickly to a constant porosity value, as the influence of the necks \nvolume decreases as the particle increases and so, the packing void \nvolume tends to a constant number which leads the porosity to reach a \nvalue of around 50 % for the cubic arrangement model. Observing \nFigure 12 one can conclude that cubic packing is the best theoretical \nparticle arrangement configuration, as it presents the best comparison \nwith data, with an average difference between data and model of about \n18.8 %. \n\n\n\n62 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 11 - Particle size distribution from Fraunhofer diffraction method for \npowders A, B, C, D, E and F (from top to bottom, left side) and binary image \n\nof sintered copper powder x200 (right side). \n\n\n\n63 \n \n\n \n \n\nThe image obtained from electronic microscopy MEV, for \npowder PAM, shows a particle circularly factor of 0.74. The circularly \nfactor changes with the particle size as shown in Figure 13a. \n\nIn Figure 13a, a plot of the porosity as a function of the average \nparticle diameter, in micrometers, for powders A, B, C, D, E and F is \npresented. Powder A showed a circularly factor of 0.85 while other \npowder was approximately 0.71. Actually the particles are non-circular \nand so, the perfect sphere lattice model may not be an accurate physical \nmodel for the porosity of the media. Therefore, the theoretical model \nmay be adjusted to include the effect of particle non-circularity by a \ncorrection factor of 0.71 in equation (3.5). The present author \nacknowledge that the circularly factor may not be representative of all \natomized particles as their geometry can change with the powder \nfabrication parameters, but, on the other hand, they are comfortable in \nproposing this circularity correction factor, as the particle images \nobserved in this work are very similar to those published in literature \n(LAWLEY, 1992). \n\n \n\nFigure 12 - Porosity models without circularly factor. \n \nFigure 13b presents the adjusted theoretical model inserting a \n\ncircularly factor in term associated to sphere volume in Equation (3.5). \nIn this figure one can see that the data now compares well with the cubic \n\n\n\n64 \n \n\nand orthorhombic packing models, for diameters larger than 50 ?m. \nOther important aspect in packing particles to consider is the variation \nof the particle diameters in the powder used for sintering. Small \nparticles with diameters equal or smaller than the interstices left by the \nlarger particles can be accommodated within these interstice spaces, \nreducing porosity. Also particle geometric characteristics such as \nroughness, prevent the spreading of particles during the powder \ndeposition, resulting in media with scattering formation. \n\n \na) \n\n \nb) \n\n \nFigure 13- a) Circularly factor measured to samples of powder copper. b) \n\nAdjusted porosity model by circularly factor. \n\n\n\n65 \n \n\n \n \n\n3.3  Effective thermal conductivity \n \n\n Effective properties are usually used to define the physical \ncharacteristics of the porous materials. The effective thermal \nconductivity, for instance, is determined considering the thermal \nconductivity of the constituent phases of the material, i.e, the solid phase \n(matrix) and the fluid phase (liquid or gas).  \n Much of the heat transfer work in the literature treats all porous \nmedia equally, independently of the technology employed for their \nfabrication. Actually, there is a large difference among porous media \nproduced by different technologies, as observed in sintered and bed \npacked metal powder. Usually, a distinction is made between the \nthermal conductivity of densified (or sintered) and not densified porous \nmedia. Carson et al. (2003) and Atabaki and Baliga (2007) verified that \nthe thermal conductivity of a non-sintered material is much smaller than \nthat of sintered materials.  \n In literature, an interesting model for the effective thermal \nconductivity based on experimental data was proposed in the PhD thesis \nof Alexander (1972) for metal felts, sintered powders, layers of wire \ncloth and unconsolidated beads. Sintering is also used in screens to \nproduce heat pipe capillary structures. Atabaki and Baliga (2007) took \nliterature models for non-sintered porous media (just packing spheres) \nand, by comparing with experimental test data, proposed a correlation \nfor sintered porous media.  \n\nAlthough Birnboim, Olorunyolemi and Carmel (2001), in their \nnumerical study related the effective thermal conductivity with the \nfabrication process and modeled porous media as spheres in thermal \ncontact, it can be affirmed that, in general terms, the literature \ntheoretical models lack to associate the effective thermal conductivity \nwith process fabrication parameters, such as: sintering temperature, \nparticle size and geometry of the ceramic powder particles.  \n In this work, the physical association among effective thermal \nconductivity, porosity and mean diameter of the particle used for the \nfabrication of sintered porous media is analyzed. The analogy with \nelectrical circuits was used to model the effective thermal conductivity, \nwhich physical model consists of two hemispherical particles joined by \na neck, with a fluid layer around them. Thermal resistances are \nassociated with the heat transfer paths of the unit cell, so that an \nexpression of the effective thermal conductivity is obtained.  \n\n\n\n66 \n \n\n Powder, with disperse particle size distribution, were separated \nthrough successive sieving to obtain narrow bands of particle sizes. \nSeveral sintered porous media made from these powders were fabricated \nand the porosity measured. The circularity of particles was measured to \nevaluate the influence of particle shapes in the resulting porous media. \nExperimental data is used in the comparison with the theoretical models. \n \n3.3.1 Physical model \n \n\nThe physical model adopted to determine the theoretical effective \nthermal conductivity of a sintered porous media is displayed in Figure \n14. The model is based on the thermal analysis of a unit cell, which \nrepresents the whole porous media. The actual porous media can be \nreproduced by stacking several of these cells in a vertical arrangement \nand replicating this pile in a horizontal array, forming a three-\ndimensional structure, according to several possible packing models as \nshown in Figure 8. As it will be explained later, in the present work, this \ncell applied to a cubic arrangement (Figure 8a). The cell is formed by \ntwo metal hemispheres of radius r. The hemispheres represent half of a \nsolid metal particle of the powder from which the porous media is made. \nThese radiuses are considered equal and equivalent to the powder mean \nradius. The hemispheres are joined by means of a neck formed during \nthe sintering process. A stationary liquid film, in a hollow hemisphere \nshape, is considered around the hemispheres. x is the radius of the neck, \ngiven by the distance between the sphere contacting point and the neck \nouter radius, in the plane tangent to the contacting point. rm is the radius \nof the meniscus formed by the neck, in the plane which contains the \ncenter of the spheres (see Figure 14). The rectangular coordinate system \norigin is located in the center of one of the hemisphere with the abscissa \ncrossing both the sphere centers. The empty space between adjacent \ncells is filled with stagnant liquid film in such a temperature level which \nallows one to neglect the heat exchanged with the solid hemispheres and \nwithin the liquid film.  \n\n \n\n\n\n67 \n \n\n \n \n\n \na) \n\n \nb) \n\nFigure 14 - Effective thermal conductivity: a) two powder particle spheres in \ncontact, b) physical model. . \n\n\n\n68 \n \n\n \nAll the geometric parameters must be determined as a function of r, \n\nwhich represent the size of the particles that compose the powder used \nfor the porous media fabrication. These diameters are obtained from the \nstatistical treatment of the distribution dimensions of particles. The \nradius of neck is calculated from the sintering curve theory. The \neffective thermal conductivity of porous media is calculated from a heat \nbalance, where the following hypotheses were adopted: \n\n\u2022 Steady state. \n\u2022 Planes perpendicular to the plane shown in Figure 14 are \n\nisothermal.  \n\u2022 Thermal equilibrium in the solid-fluid interface.  \n\u2022 Solid and fluid constant properties.  \n\u2022 The fluid layer surrounds and wets completely the particles. \n\nThe fluid layer is considered stagnant; therefore, convective \neffects are neglected. \n\n\u2022 Prescribed temperatures T2 and T1, where T2 > T1, are \nimposed to the two borders of the cell (see Figure 14) \n\n\u2022 All powder particles have spherical shape, have the same \nradius and are statistically represented by the mean \ndiameter.   \n\n\u2022 The neck has circular shape in the plane perpendicular to the \nheat flux.  \n\n\u2022 Compaction external forces and phase change are not \nconsidered. \n\n \n3.3.2 Mathematical model \n \n\nThe analogy between thermal and electrical circuits is used to model \nthe effective thermal conductivity of the elementary cell just described. \nThe resulting thermal circuit, consisting of two resistances in parallel, is \npresent in Figure 15. In this figure, the thicker arrow refers the lower \nresistance path where larger amount of heat is transferred, while the \nthinner arrow refers to the large resistance path, where lower amount of \nheat is transferred. The first path is associated with the resistance due to \nthe conduction heat transfer through the hemispheres (constriction \nresistance Rhs), in series with the neck Rps resistance. The other path is \nassociated with the static fluid surrounding the spheres (Rl) and includes \nthe resistance of the disk formed by the fluid in the neck (Rpl). This last \n\n\n\n69 \n \n\n \n \n\nresistance is considered negligible. The s superscript refers to solid and l \nto liquid.

(2013) measured the effective thermal conductivity of \n\nsintered copper porous media saturated with water, air and at vacuum. \nThey concluded that the liquid resistance is much larger than the solid \nresistance and, therefore, the liquid resistance path can be removed from \nthe circuit, resulting in:  \n\n \n SE ?

(1978), developed \nfor the conduction heat transfer between solid or hollow spheres in \ncontact. In this model, the heat flux enters the elementary cell by the left \nflat circular area of radius r maintained at temperature T1 and it is \nreleased to the right area maintained at temperature T2 (see Figure 14).  \nThe heat delivered to the hot hemisphere is constricted to the neck \nregion when passing to the other hemisphere and then spread in the cold \nhemisphere. The same happens to the liquid shell. The lateral walls of \nthe elementary cell are considered insulated. The solid and hollow \nsphere constriction thermal resistances are obtained from the exact \ntemperature distribution solution of the heat equation in spherical \ncoordinates, as a function of directions r and ?, solved by Yovanovich et \nal. (1978). Their solution is given in terms of a series. Bahrami et al. \n(2006) presented a simplified expression for Yovanovich et al.  (1978) \n\nsolution, valid for a specific range of contact angles. In this thesis, a \nstudy similar to that presented by Bahrami et al.

According to manufacturer \nof device, Thermal Conductivity Analyzer employs a model transient \nheat transfer to calculate the thermal conductivity. A cylindrical sample \nis placed on the plane sensor. A known current is applied to the sensor's \nspiral heating element, providing a small amount of heat, which warms \nup the interface between the sensor and the sample, inducing a variation \nin the voltage readings of the sensor. Then, the rate of increase in the \nsensor voltage is used to determine the thermal properties of the sample. \nA photography and scheme of the experimental setup is presents in the \nFigure 16. Cylindrical samples with 25 mm of diameter and 5 mm of \nthickness was used to measure the effective thermal conductivity. To \nguarantee the plane face in the sample, it was sanded until obtained a \nplanes superficies. The samples also were saturated with distillated \nwater. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n74 \n \n\n \n \n\n  \nFigure 16 - Schematic of Thermal conductivity analyzer measurement setup. 1. Sensor, 2. Sample, 3.

The \nexperimental data obtained by Fl\u00f3rez et al. (2013)  are also analyzed. \nThe Equation (3.27) expresses non-dimensional effective thermal \nconductivity as a function of the neck radius and porosity. Substituting \nthe porosity given by Equation (3.5) into Equation (3.27), one can have \nthe effective thermal conductivity becomes a function of powder particle \nradius only.  \n\nIn Figure 17, the neck radius is plotted against the average particle \ndiameter, for two different temperatures of sintering. In this figure, it is \npossible to observe that the neck is more sensitive to variations of the \nneck radius for small diameter particles, where a slope curve change is \nobserved for particles diameters about 20 to 30 \u00b5 m. One can also see \nthat the sintering temperature influences the neck formation: the higher \nthe temperature, the higher the neck radius. Also, the differences \nbetween the neck radiuses for media sintered at these two temperatures \nlevels varies from zero do around 15 %. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 17 - The neck radius against mean particle diameter. \n \n\n\n\n76 \n \n\nFigure 18 presents the comparison between the effective thermal \nconductivity calculated from the theoretical model presented in this \nwork and with two sets of experimental data (run 1 and 2) obtained for \ncopper sintered porous media fabricated in Labtucal at 850 \u00b0C from \npowders PAM (around 50\u00b5 m) and PAC (around 20 \u00b5m), saturated by \ndistilled water, obtained by Fl\u00f3rez et al. (2013). The results of the \neffective thermal conductivity measured in the samples obtained from \nsieved of PAM copper powder showed the dependency of the effective \nthermal conductivity with particle size and neck compared to the \nproposed models (cubic and Orthorhombic). The results of effective \nthermal conductivity for particle diameter lower than 60 ?m present a \ndifference that increases as the average article diameter decreases. The \nhigher difference was obtained to the effective thermal conductivity \nmeasured to copper powder with average particle diameter of 22.23 ?m, \nit was a 45.7 % above of the value predicted by the proposed models. \nThe lower difference of 6.8 % was to sample with the average particle \ndiameter equal to 68.81 ?m when compared to the orthorhombic model. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 18 - Effective thermal conductivity model against average particle \n\ndiameter. \n \nEven, in Figure 18, the results of the effective thermal conductivity \n\nbased in cubic and orthorhombic packing arrangement show best \n\n\n\n77 \n \n\n \n \n\ncomparison with experimental data: for cubic model, the highest \ndifference is 23.3 % and for the orthorhombic model, it is 11.5 %. One \nshould note that the theoretical orthorhombic model curve is within the \nexperimental uncertainty reported by the present author in Fl\u00f3rez et al. \n(2013), represented by vertical bars in this graphic. Note that, in this \nfigure, the porosity model which provides the input parameter for the \neffective thermal conductivity model was not corrected by the \ncircularity factor, as non-circular spheres where not taken into account \nin the physical model, which schematic is shown in Figure 14. \n\nOne can see that experimental data obtained by Fl\u00f3rez et al. (2013) \nshowed the best comparison with the proposed models than the results \nobtained for the porous media fabricated from sieved powder. This \nbehavior can be explained due to following reasons. In the measurement \nusing the thermal conductivity analyzer C-thermal Tci, one face of the \nsample in contact with the sensor was sanded. The original surface is \nmodified closing the porous with the extract material. The measured \nmethod using by thermal conductivity analyzer C-thermal Tci is a flesh \nmethod. The response of the sample for a pulse of energy is modeled as \na conductive heat problem in transient state. Then, the properties are \ndetermined as the parameter solution of the inversed problem. Hence the \neffective thermal conductivity measured can be modified due to \nreduction of the porosity of the surface of the sample analyzed. \n\nIn the other hand, the measurement method used in the experimental \nwork by Fl\u00f3rez et al. (2013) was the comparative method where the \nsamples are not modified by application the pressure or sanding.  \n\nTheoretical non-dimensional effective thermal conductivity and \nporosity against non-dimensional neck radius x/d are presented in the \nFigure 19. It can be observed that the porosity decreases as the x/d \ndiameter increases, this effect is more pronounced for large values of \nx/d, while, for x/d ranging from 0.07 to 0.2, the porosity value is almost \nconstant. On the other hand, the effective thermal conductivity shows a \nclose to linear behavior with the particle diameter increase. Actually, the \nneck radio growth improves the heat transfer because there is more \navailable area to transfer the heat. These results were calculated using \nthe effective thermal conductivity for the theoretical model based on \ncubic and orthorhombic packing arrangements, for sintering temperature \nof 850 \u00baC. \n\nFigure 20 presents a comparison between experimental data and the \neffective thermal conductivity calculated from the model proposed in \nthis work, considering the porosity resulting from cubic packing. This \n\n\n\n78 \n \n\nfigure also shows a comparison with literature models. It is important to \nhighlight that the input parameter for the effective thermal conductivity \nof sintered porous media in literature models (ALEXANDER, 1972; \nATABAKI; BALIGA, 2007) is the porosity, which has to be measured \nafter the media is fabricated, since no literature model predicts the \nporosity as a function of the fabrication parameters. Instead, in the \npresent model, the input parameter is the mean powder radius, data \nusually provided by the powder supplier. \n\n \nFigure 19 - Non-dimensional effective thermal conductivity and porosity \n\nagainst neck radius. \nIt is interesting to note that, in the present model, porosity zero \n\nmeans that only the presence of the solid is observed, while porosity one \nmeans that only fluid phase is considered. So, there no sense in working \nwith these two limits. In the present model, the porosity has a higher, \nbound limited by the selection of the packing arrangement. Therefore, \nthe plots are limited to porosities ranging from 0.2 (achievable for \npowder with a large dimension spectrum and/or sintered at higher \ntemperature levels) to around 0.6, the highest theoretical porosity for \nregularly arranged spheres, with no necks. This is supported by the \nobservation of the experimental data presented in Figure 12, where the \nporosity achieves a maximum value, which is kept constant, regardless \nof the increase in the diameter of the particle.  \n\n\n\n79 \n \n\n \n \n\n \nFigure 20 - Effective thermal conductivity versus porosity for experimental data \n\nand values calculated from literature models for porous media saturated with \nwater. \n\n \nThe difference between the present effective thermal conductivity \n\nmodels ad data ranges from 14.7 % to 23.3 %. The Alexander (1972) \nmodel presents the best comparison with experimental data, which \nranges between -4 % and -6.8 %. The model of Atabaki and Baliga \n(2007) also shows a good comparison with the data, varying from 23.6 \nand 40 %. Actually, the present model compares very well with Atabaki \nand Baliga (2007)  model for low porosity porous media but the \ncomparison deteriorates as the porosity tends to the physical model limit \n(porosity around 47 %), due to the reasons described in the last a \nparagraph.  \n\nAgain one should remember that, in Figure 20, to determine the \npresent model effective thermal conductivity as a function of porosity, \ntwo models were used: one to obtain the x\u2013axis data (porosity) and other \nfor the y-axis parameter, or the effective thermal conductivity, both \nusing the mean particle radius as input parameter. On the other hand, for \nthe literature model, the input parameter is obtained by the direct \nmeasurement of the porosity. Therefore, the good comparison between \ndata and present model and among the present and literature models, \n\n\n\n80 \n \n\nshow that the models presented can be applied for the prediction of the \nporosity and of the effective thermal conductivity of sintered porous \nmedia. \n\n \n3.4  Permeability \n\n \nOne of the most important properties for porous media is the \n\npermeability. The knowledge of permeability enables the prediction of the \nflow rate for a pre-determined pressure drop or, on the other side, the \nprediction of the fluid pressure necessary to achieve a specific flow rate.  \n\nActually, permeability is associated with the porosity of the porous \nstructure and with the powder particle diameter. This relation is known as \nBlake \u2013 Kozeny\u2019s Equation (KAVIANY, 1995). Other permeability \nmodels such as Carman Kozeny and Rumpfe-Gupte are also used in heat \npipes predictions. These models determine the permeability from porosity \nand particle diameter parameters (FAGHRI, 1995). Several works in \nliterature are focused in the improvement of this model.  \n\nByon and Kim (2013) investigated experimentally and analytically the \neffects of the particle size distribution and of the packing structure. In this \nstudy, they considered two distinct types of porous media: mono-dispersed \nand bi-dispersed. The effect of the particle structure was represented by \ntwo geometry parameters: the particle arrangement and the particle bonded \narea, which depends on the sintering condition. The effect of the particle \narrangement was studied for three unit-cell configurations: face centered \ncubic (FCC), body centered cubic (BCC) and simple cubic (SC). The \neffect of the bonded area (between sphere particles) and of the particle \nradius were also considered. They modified Blake Kozeny\u2019s equation \nusing two correction factors for the particle size: (the mean particle \ndiameter and the mean cluster size) and obtained a correlation for \npermeability of bi-dispersed medium.   \n\nAnother commonly used relation is Darcy\u2019s Law that relates the \npressure drop to the flow velocity. Endo et al. (2009) used the analogy \nbetween electrical circuit and Darcy\u2019s Law to obtain the permeability \nparameter. This author considered several particle diameters and the \nresulting packing bed was divided into small cubic regions, defined as unit \ncells. The unit cells have different electrical resistances, which were \nconnected in a combination of series and parallel paths. Ohm and \nKirchoff\u2019s law were used in the solution of the equivalent thermal circuits, \nresulting in the hydraulic resistance model. Then, numerical method was \nemployed in order to obtain the permeability of the bed packing. \nExperiments were done using several porosity glass beds, polypropylene \n\n\n\n81 \n \n\n \n \n\nparticles and silica particles, of different sizes and shapes. Their \nexperimental data were in good agreement with the results of theoretical \ncalculations.  \n\nYang et al. (2014) simplified an expression that determines the \npermeability for isotropic porous media as a function of the tortuosity, \nporosity and pore size, obtaining an equation that depends only of porosity \nand pore size. Therefore, this analytical study discusses the effect of these \ntwo morphological parameters on the permeability. Permeability of inverse \nwick (media in which porosity is larger than that found in conventional \nsintered particle wick, due to the sacrificial template used during the \nsintering particles process) was investigated numerically by Ngo and Byon \n(2016). As Blake \u2013 Kozeny\u2019s and Kozeny \u2013 Carman\u2019s equations cannot be \napplied for materials with very high porosity, these authors performed a \nnon-linear regression analysis in order to embrace all configurations of \nwicks (KAVIANY, 1995). As a result, correlations based on numerical \nsimulation were obtained for different packing structures. Two modified \nKozeny\u2013Carman equations were proposed: one for conventional wicks and \nanother for inverse wicks. \n\nFrom this literature review, one can see that several parameters are \nnecessary to predict the permeability of sintered porous media. In this \nsection, an analytical model for prediction of the permeability of sintered \nporous media, made from particles of approximately the same dimensions, \nis presented. In this approach, the fluid flow through the gaps within \nspheres in contact of a simplified arrangement geometry is modeled. \nSintered porous media is modeled as an arrangement of spherical particles, \nwith several packing configurations. \n\n \n3.4.1 Mathematical model \n\n \nThe powder particles from which the porous media is made are \n\nmodeled as spheres of uniform radius r. Several packing configurations \ncan be observed, when the same diameter spheres are in contact. In Figure \n21a, two packing configurations according to German (1989) are \npresented: simple cubic and orthorhombic. These arrangements are \nemployed to determine the theoretical permeability of a sintered porous \nmedia.  \n\nAny arrangement of same diameter spheres shapes channels with \nnon-circular cross sections within where fluids subjected to pressure \ndifferences flow, following a pattern of consecutive constrictions and \nexpansions. Figure 21b shows the schematic of cross the sections of the \n\n\n\n82 \n \n\nducts formed by spheres in simple and orthorhombic cubic packing \narrangement. \n\na)  \n\nb)  \n\nFigure 21 - Channels physical model a) Cubic b) Orthorhombic. \n \nIn this work, the permeability was modelled using the Darcy\u2019s law. Henry \nDarcy made an experiment based on the flow of water though a pipe packed \nwith sand. He noticed that the velocity u is uniform and proportional to the \nnegative of pressure gradient (AKBARI; SISTON; BAHRAMI, 2010). This \nrelation, known as Darcy\u2019s law is enunciated as: \n\n ? 4$4? ? vw xy  (3.28) \nwhere ? is the permeability of the media (m2), \u00b5 is the dynamic viscosity \nof fluid and dP/dx is the pressure gradient in the direction of x-axis. In \nthe present case, the fluid mass flow m&amp;  within the bulk space among the \nspheres can be expressed as:  \n \n\n z? ? ?\\? xy (3.29) \n \nwhere An is the transversal area at inlet of channel for each packing system \nconsidered and uD is Dacy\u2019s velocity. Substituting Equation (3.28) in \n\n\n\n83 \n \n\n \n \n\n(3.29) and integrating in the x direction along the L length, the mass ratio \nbecomes: \n \n\n z? ? ?\\? wv ?$]  (3.30) \n \nFrom the analogy of Darcy\u2019s law with Fourier\u2019s law, the hydraulic \n\nresistance of the mass flux through a cross section can be defined as: \n \n\n SZy ? v]?\\? w (3.31) \n \nAnother expression for the hydraulic resistance through ducts can be \n\nobtained from the solution of the internal flow, according to the particle \narrangement. Akbari et al. (2010) obtained an expression for the \nhydraulic resistance, based on converging-diverging laminar fully \ndeveloped flows. From the solution of conservation of mass and \nmomentum equations, the unit cell pressure drop in z-axis direction can \nbe obtained, with the adoption of the following hypothesis:   \n\n\u2022 Steady state conditions. \n\u2022 Two dimensional (r,z) cylindrical coordinated problem.  \n\u2022 Laminar regime. \n\u2022 Fully developed velocity profile. \n\u2022 Isotropic wick structure. \n\u2022 Particle material is represented by spheres of an average \n\nradius.  \n\u2022 The working fluid is incompressible. \n\u2022 Constant properties. \n\u2022 Non-slip condition of the fluid on the walls. \n\u2022 Gravity effect is negligible. \n\n \nTherefore, the conservation of mass equation takes the following form, \nwhere u and v are the axial and radial velocities, respectively:  \n \n\n 1> ||> ?>}? ? |x|I ? 0 (3.32) \n \nThe Navier-Stokes equation in r and z are: \n\n\n\n84 \n \n\n \n\n ? =} |x|> ? x |x|I ? ? ? |$|I ? v ~1> ||>&lt;> |x|> @ ? |C x|IC ?

(3.34) \n\n \nThese partial differential equations are subject to the boundary conditions: \n \n\n x?S, I? ? 0, }?>, I? ? 0, S ? ??I?, $?>, 0? ? $? (3.35) \n \nwhere a(z) is the radio of the equivalent cross section liquid flow area, \nwhich depends on the geometry of the sphere arrangement, to be discussed \nin the next section. The axial and radial velocities profiles, proposed by \nAkbari et al. (2010) are respectively:  \n \n\n x?>, I? ? 2x!,? &lt;????I?@C ?1 ? = >??I??C? (3.36) \n \n\nIntegrating the Equation (3.33) for P in z and calculating the average \npressure in z = 0 (a0) and z = r (a1), Akbari [9] obtained an expression \nfor the pressure drop in z-axis direction: \n\n ?$ ? 16vx!,?]??C ??\n6 ? ? ? 13?C ? z? ?1 ? ??2?? ? (3.37) \n\nwhere m?=r'?z?, ?= a1/a0 is ratio between the minimum and the \nmaximum radius. Again, from analogy between the hydraulic flow and \nelectrical circuit, the following hydraulic resistance can be defined:  \n \n\n SZ?/+L ? ?$z?  (3.38) \n \nwhich is equivalent to a flow in a single converging-diverging tube. \nThese fluid flow phenomena was considered as equivalent to the \nconstriction-expansion observed in real channels, formed within spheres \nof a unit cell. The mass ratio m&amp;  that flows across of the unit cell is \ndefined as: \n\n\n\n85 \n \n\n \n \n\n z? ? ?v!,?Gx??C (3.39) \n \nwhere um,0 is mean velocity evaluated in z = 0.

(3.41) \n\n \nActually, the application of this model requires transformation of \n\nnon-circular ducts into circular tubes using characteristic lengths. In the \nfollowing section, several procedures are proposed to convert non-\ncircular sections into equivalent circular channels. \n\n \n3.4.2 Characteristic dimensions \n\n \nIn the present work, non-circular ducts are modelled as circular, \n\nusing several specific characteristic dimensions, such as the hydraulic \nratio and the characteristic length ?\\, as proposed by Bahrami et al. \n(2006). These dimensions vary along the liquid flow channel. The \nsummary of the equivalent hydraulic diameter expressions (d) is \npresented in the Table 5. \n\n \nTable 5.

In Table \n6, two expressions for the equivalent radius for the cubic packing \narrangement are presented, where m(z) is a geometric parameter, defined \nas: \n\n z?I? ? >?1 ? ?I ? >?C>C  (3.44) \nand where r is the average particle radius of the powder material of the \nporous media.  \n \nTable 6.

The first \none consists of a distilled water tank and an air pressure transducer, \nresponsible for keeping the water flow in constant fluxes. The second \nsection consists of a working fluid valve, which allows the controlling \nof the water mass fluxes during the permeability measurement, and a \ndigital manometer Z\u00fcrich-Z10B that measures the water pressure before \nentering the sample. In the third section, the sample is positioned \nbetween the two rubber gaskets by a holder and pressed against a \nstainless steel case. Between the second and the third sections, there is a \ntube, which length is more than 7.5 times higher than the diameter of \nduct, to guarantee the developed flow at inlet region of the sample \n(FOX; MCDONALD, 2001). The mass flow rate is calculated from the \nmeasurement of the water mass accumulated in a Becker recipient for a \ntime period of 30 seconds, registered by a digital chronometer. The \npermeability of copper powder sintered cylindrical samples was \nmeasured. The properties of the distilled water, evaluated at 25 \u00b0C, were \nobtained from literature thermodynamic tables (CENGEL; BOLES, \n2006). Particles of different sizes obtained from successive mechanical \nvibration siftings of atomized copper powder were employed in \nfabrication of samples and the permeability were measured. \n \n3.4.4 Data analysis and results \n \n\nIn this section, the analysis of the permeability measured according \nto procedure explained previous section is presents. The experimental \nporosity used to compare the permeability calculated from the literature \nmodel is presented in the Table 8. \n\n \nTable 8.

The x-axis represents the average particle \ndiameter of the metal powder used to fabricate the sintered porous media \ntested and the y-axis represents the permeability. One can conclude, \nobserving Figure 26, that the results of the permeability model, based on \nthe cubic packing arrangement, where the hydraulic diameter is taken as \nthe square root of the cross area, shows the best comparison with \nexperimental data. However, the difference between this model and \nexperimental data vary from 19 % to 143 %. This large difference can be \nexplained by simplifications such as the hypothesis of perfect particle \nspherical shape and of their ordered arrangement. In this work, the \nfabrication method used to produce the powder was atomization of copper \nin liquid flow, which does not produce particles completely spherical \n(LAWLEY, 1992). \n\n \nFigure 26 - Permeability results compared with the proposed models. \n\n \nThe permeability calculated using the proposed model has the same \n\norder of magnitude of the experimental data, which is a very good result, \nconsidering the magnitude of the permeability and the inherent difficulty in \nmeasuring and modelling such small physical parameters. In Figure 26, \none can also observe the similar behavior trends followed by the \n\n\n\n92 \n \n\ntheoretical results and the experimental data. It suggests that the model \nbased on a converging-diverging tube is a good approximation for the \nliquid flow into a porous media, in low Reynolds number regimen.  \n\nThe other models proposed based in cubic (hydraulic diameter \ncalculated form 4A/P) and orthorhombic (hydraulic diameter calculated \nform 4A/P and the square of across area) packings present higher \ndifferences when compared with experimental measurement, that can be \nup to 400 % larger than the data.   \n\n\u2022 Comparison with literature models \n\nFigure 27 shows a comparison between the experimental data and the \npermeability calculated from the proposed and literature models. Note that \nthe permeability calculated from literature models require the porosity and \nthe average particle diameter as input parameters, while, in the present \nmodel, only the particle dimension is the input data. In Figure 27, one can \nsee that both literature and proposed models show similar behaviors. \nHowever, the smaller difference of the permeability estimated by models \nwas 53 % and the largest was 400 % (Carman-Kozeny), when compared to \nexperimental data.  \n\n \n\nFigure 27 - Permeability results comparing the proposed and literature models, \nbased on porosity and average particle diameter. \n\n \nActually, in literature of LHPs, these models (Karman-Kozeny, Blake-\n\nkozeny and Rumpte-Gupte) are used to calculate the permeability of \n\n\n\n93 \n \n\n \n \n\nsintered porous (FAGHRI, 1995; KAVIANY, 1995). A good evaluation of \nthe impact that the uncertainty in the determination of the permeability can \nhave over the prediction of LHP behavior can be observed from the \ncalculation of the pressure drop for water flow within sintered porous \nmedia with fixed geometry, which can be obtained from the equation:  \n\n ?$ ? ]w\\ vz???  (3.50) \nThis expression was applied for the presently tested device. In equation \n\n22, ? is the dynamic viscosity, ? is the density of water, L is the porous \nmedia thickness (8 mm), A is the cross section area (cylindrical sample of \n8 mm of diameter) and z?  is the mass flux of 1.91x10-3 kg/s. The pressure \ndrop calculated using several permeability models, including the one \nproposed in the present work, is present in Figure 28, where one can see \nthat the simple cubic packing model, based on the square root of the area, \npresents the best comparison with pressure drop data. The smallest \ndifference observed is 16 % while the largest is 59 %. One can also note \nthat, for all models, the difference between data and data increases for \nintermediate average particle diameter of the particles. Actually, this \nbehavior follows the same trends observed in Figure 26 for the same range \nof particle diameter, where the permeability comparison between data and \nmodels also decreased.  \n\n \nFigure 28 - Pressure drop results compared to the proposed and literature \n\nmodels. \n\n\n\n94 \n \n\nActually, one can consider as a reasonable prediction of the permeability \nif the model is able to calculate the permeability within the actual order of \nmagnitude. Although, in Figure 26, the difference between the \npermeability predicted by the literature models and experimental data was \nof more than one order of magnitude, the largest pressure drop difference \nbetween prediction and data lies between 70 and 100 %.  \n\n \n3.5  Effective porous radius \n\n \nPores can be classified according to size: very large are called \n\ncaverns and very small are called micropores or ultramicropores \n(KAVIANY, 1995). Pores of different size can be found inside the \nporous medium due to the process of manufacturing. Pore size is \nconnected with other properties as permeability, porosity, effective \nthermal conductivity. The pumping capability of a wick in a loop heat \npipe is expressed as function of the pore radius. The Laplace-Young \n(GENNES; BROCHARD-WYART; QU\u00c9R\u00c9, 2004) equation indicates \nthe capillary pressure of the wicks generated by the liquid-vapor \ninterface and is known as: \n ?$\n?? ? 2?>?  (3.51) \nwhere ? is the working fluid surface tension, rp is the pore radius and ? \nis contact angle formed between solid and liquid. In order to \ncharacterize the wicks more simply, the equation is replaced by: \n \n\n ?$\n?? ? 2?>[55 (3.52) \n \nwhere reff  is the effective pore radius. \n\nIn the literature, the effective pore radio is measured experimentally \nusing the Equation (3.52). Singh et al. (2009) determined \nexperimentally wick properties as permeability, pores radius, porosity \nand effective thermal conductivity. In order to measure pores radius, a \ntransparent PVC tube was bent in the form of a U. Due to equality \nbetween air pressure and surface tension force of the water, bubbles \nemerge and allow to measure pore radius.  \n\n\n\n95 \n \n\n \n \n\nGiraudon et al. (2016) also used hydrostatic pressure to measure \npore radius. Furthermore, they developed a model for the most \nappropriate porous structure characteristics taking into account some \nparameters as thickness, porosity, permeability, pore radius and thermal \nconductivity. The model predicts the final wick characteristics as a \nfunction of the manufacturing parameters. \n\nTang et al. (2013) examined the permeability and capillary \npressure in normal sintered and grooved wicks. They also studied the \neffects of powder size, wick type and gravity in these tests. For capillary \nrate-of-rise tests, an infrared thermal was employed which enables to \nobserve the moving front of liquid. \n\nHolley and Faghri (2006) measured permeability and effective \npore radius using the rate-of-rise test of sintered metal powder and \ncarbon paper samples. For the rise of liquid in a wick, capillary pressure \nis assumed to be in balance with hydrostatic pressure and pressure loss \nassociated with friction, taken from Darcy\u2019s Law.  \n\nLi et al. (2010) developed a method to investigate the capillary \npumping amount changing curve recorded by experiment. For this, tree \nparameters were considered: capillary pumping amount (the maximum \nof working fluid that can be pumped into the porous wick), capillary \npumping time (the time that the porous wick needs to reach saturation \nfrom the beginning of the capillary pumping) and capillary pumping rate \n(the velocity that the porous wick reaches saturation). They discovered \nthat capillary pumping amount changing curve could be described with \nan exponential increase equation. The effect of porosity on capillary \npumping was also studied. They conclude that capillary pumping rate \nincreases with the increasing of the porosity. \n\nAnother quantity commonly measured is representative pore \nradius that represents the pore radii at which 50 % of the non-wetting \nliquid intrusion volume occurs. Li et al. (2010) found differences \nbetween representative pore radii and effective pore radii. This \ndifference is attributed to the variation in contact angle made by the \nwetting liquid on the solid surface in experiments, possibly induced by \ncontaminations. Palakurthi et al. (2015) studied the relationship between \neffective and representative pore radii using numerical experiments that \nallow to eliminate the effect of contact angle variations by keeping the \ncontact angle constant. They conclude that the disparity between \neffective and representative pore radii do not arise from the contact \nangle variations.  \n\n \n\n\n\n96 \n \n\n3.5.1 Mathematical model \n \n\nTo model of effective porous radius is used the concept of hydraulic \ndiameter proposed to calculate the permeability in the section 3.4. From \ngeometrical transformation, similar expressions defined to a(z) are \nevaluated in z = 0 and z = rp. Therefore, the effective pore radius is \ndefined as: \n\n >[55 ? ??I? (3.53) \nwhere a(z) is the hydraulic diameter evaluated for each packing \narrangement (cubic and orthorhombic). \n\n \n3.5.2 Experimental procedure \n\n \nThe effective pore radius tests are based in the measured of the \n\npressure capillary required to equilibrate a meniscus of some specified \nsize and shape. The bubble point test proposed by Dunn and Reay \n(1978) , where pressurized gas is applied to one side of a wick saturated \nwith liquid. Thus, the gas pressure is gradually increased and the \ncapillary pressure is measured at the point when bubbles form on the \nopposite side of the wick sample. Another test used by Faghri (1995) is \nthe risen meniscus, where the liquid level rises in a wick sample until \nthe capillary and hydrostatic pressures are equilibrated. \n\nTo determine of effective porous radius was fabricated an \nexperimental set up bases in the bubbles method according to Paiva \n(2011). The apparatus is composed for an argon gas cylinder where a \npressure valve is coupled. Other, second valve controls the mass rate. \nFollowing, a pressure sensor (Omega PX409-015DWUV) is used to \nmeasure the pressure gas in the internal side of the sample. Finally, an \nacquisition system data (National Instruments NISCXI-1000) is used to \nregister the gradually increased of pressure. The design and \nphotographic of experimental apparatus is present are presented in the \nFigure 29.  \n\nCopper sintered samples with cylindrical shape was fabricated and \ncoated laterally with an epoxy resin. After, which the resin dried, the \nsample is attached into a silicone hose. The opposite side of the sample \nis filled with distillated water. The argon gas released across of sample \nuntil the gas pressure exceeds the hydrodynamic pressure and bobbles \nstart appear. The measure process is repeated by 5 times. \n \n\n\n\n97 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 29 - Schematic of critical radius measurement setup. 1. Argon gas cylinder, 2.Gas pressure gauge, 3.

One \ncan see that both Bahrami and Fox cubic packing hydraulic diameter \ncurves (superposed) have reasonable comparisons with the experimental \ndata. Due to the adopted physical model, the two hydraulic equivalent \ndiameters are equal for z=0. Using 0.21dp as the effective porous radio, \nas suggested in the literature (SINGH; AKBARZADEH; MOCHIZUKI, \n2009), actually overestimate the pump capacity, as one can see by the \nlight green curve in Figure 30.  \n\n \nFigure 30 - Effective porous radio results compared to proposed, based on \n\nhydraulic diameter and average particle diameter. \n \n3.6  Conclusions \n\n \nIn this chapter, several models based on the mean particle diameter \n\nas parameter input were proposed to estimate the porosity, effective \nthermal conductivity, permeability and effective porous radio of sintered \nporous media. The sintering process was descripted and mechanisms \nand models of literature were presented. Experimental apparatus were \ndeveloped to measure the thermophysical properties and data were \ncompared to theoretical values obtaining good comparison. These \n\n\n\n99 \n \n\n \n \n\nmodels allowed to obtain the theoretical limit where the thermophysical \nproperties analyzed are adequate and it becomes in a design tool. \n\nIn Figure 31, a summary of the thermophysical properties as \nfunctions of the average particle diameter and the experimental data are \npresented. The theoretical curve and experimental data for the effective \nthermal conductivity and permeability show opposite behavior, while \nthe effective thermal conductivity decreases as the average particle \ndiameter increases, the permeability and the effective porous radio \nincrease as average particle diameter increases. The effective thermal \nconductivity and the permeability curve have a cross point that can be \nconsidered a limit between desirable and undesirable design values for \nthis property. In the active zone of the evaporator is necessary that the \nwick structure have a high permeability to flow the working fluid with \nthe lowest pressure drop. The effective thermal conductivity linked to \ngeometry should allow that the highest heat power achieves the \nevaporation surface and avoid the heat transferred to the compensation \nchamber. Then, according with the Figure 31, the material properties \nchosen must be one with average particle diameter higher than 20 ?m. \nHowever, one can be seen that capillary pressure depends on the \neffective porous radio, hence, small porous provide high capillary \npumping. To determine the viability of a geometry and material for a \nwick structure of a LHP evaporator, the thermal and hydraulic response \nshould be analyzed simultaneously. \n\n \nFigure 31 - Thermophysical properties as functions of the average \n\nparticle diameter and the experimental data. \n\n\n\n100 \n \n\nIn the chapter 5, two type materials with 36 and 51 ?m will be \nstudied using a statistical analysis to determine the effect of the \nthermophysical properties and the geometrical of wick on the thermal \nand hydraulic responses for a power and operating temperature \nprescribed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n101 \n \n\n \n \n\n4 EVAPORATOR MODEL FOR LOOP HEAT PIPES \n\nIn this chapter, models for designing the geometry of cylindrical \nLHP evaporators and for predicting their thermal behavior are \ndeveloped. In the first section, an expression based on scale analyses is \nproposed to determine a critical design factor, which relates the \nthermophysical properties of wick structure, the fluid properties and \nthermodynamic operation conditions with the geometrical parameters. \nAnalytical models based on the solution of the mass, momentum and \nenergy conservation equations in cylindrical coordinates were developed \nto analyze and avoid the dry-out of the liquid in evaporator wick \nstructure. The temperature and pressure fields and the heat and mass \nflux were also obtained. Thermal and electrical analogy circuit model \nwas used to estimate the operation temperature of the LHP. In this work, \nseveral literature models were used to calculate the thermal performance \nand pressure drop along the LHP, for comparison purposes. \n\n \n4.1 Heat Transfer analysis \n\n \n Several LHP heat transfer models are found in the literature. Launay \net al. (2008) proposed an analytical mathematical model based on an \nequivalent thermal circuit. Singh et al. (2009) presented a theoretical \nmodel based on a heat balance (first law of thermodynamics) performed \nfor a LHP with a cylindrical evaporator, similar to the one studied by Ku \n(1999), a cylindrical evaporator LHP with a primary and a secondary \nporous media layers. Kaya et al. (1999) proposed models for the thermal \nbehavior of LHPs based on known geometric and thermophysical \nproperties of materials and working fluids. Other models proposed are \nbased on solutions of the continuity and energy equations, for simplified \nsections of the porous media within the evaporator.  \n Cao and Faghri (1994) presented analytical solutions for the liquid \npressure and velocity fields and for the temperature distributions. Their \nphysical model consisted of a porous media section, heated by solid fins. \nDarcy\u00b4s equations were employed to solve the velocity fields. Their \nanalytical temperature results compared well with numerical data. \nHowever, the temperature field obtained did not allow for the \ndetermination of the heat transferred to the compensation chamber (heat \nleakage), which disturbs the thermal performance of the device. A \nnumerical solution for the temperature distribution of a section of the \n\n\n\n102 \n \n\nporous media, heated by a fin, was also presented by Demidov and \nYatsenko (1994). They observed that the vapor front in the evaporator \nstarts in the contacting surface between the heater wall and the wick \nstructure: high heat fluxes may cause the onset of vapor bubbles that \nmay grow and coalesce, eventually covering the entire contacting \nsurface.  \n Siedel et al. (2005) developed an analytical model to determine the \nthermo-hydraulic behavior of LHPs. They combined energy balance \nequation with two-dimensional (2D) temperature field equations for a \ncylindrical evaporator, including the wick structure and casing. The \nvalues of the temperature-sensitive thermophysical parameters were \ntaken for temperatures observed experimentally. This model presented \ngood agreement with numerical simulation results and with \nexperimental data. \n Santos (2010) solved numerically thermal and hydraulic models for \nceramic wick of evaporators of LHPs and CPLs. He studied \ntheoretically a porous media composed by two layers of media with \ndifferent thermal conductivities. Experimental tests were performed for \ntwo working fluids: water and acetone. Li and Peterson (2011) \ndeveloped a three-dimensional (3D) model to analyze the heat and mass \ntransfer of a flat evaporator of a LHP. Simulation results show good \nagreement with the operational temperature experimental data. Sintered \ncopper powder was the wick structure used in the studied evaporator.   \n Chernysheva and Maydanik (2012) presented a 3D mathematical \nmodel for a flat sintered copper porous media evaporator, filled with \nwater. The geometries of vapor exit channel, compensation chamber and \nporous structure were considered in their model. Actually, due to the \nevaporator mounting design, only a small fraction of the area, available \nfor the heat exchange between evaporator and heat source, was used and \nso, the surface contact temperature did not follow the trends observed in \nthe rest of the compensation chamber. Therefore, the formation of vapor \nwas not uniform and it concentrated mainly on the central contact area \nbetween the evaporator and the heat source, showing low evaporation in \nthe peripheral regions.  \n The performed literature review shows that the several works \nconcerning analytical and numerical predictions of the thermal \nperformance of LHPs do not deal with the evaporator geometry studied \nin the present work. In addition, no available model provides a criterion \nto be used for the design of the porous media thickness. In this work, \ntheoretical and experimental analyses of the temperature and pressure \ndistribution within working fluid filled porous media are presented. It is \n\n\n\n103 \n \n\n \n \n\nshown that the resulting model can be used as a tool for designing LHP \nevaporators. The general model for determination of the operation \ntemperature is presented. In the next chapter, two evaporators were \ndesigned and fabricated using the tools developed in this work. The \nexperimental data obtained were analyzed and used as \u201cstudy cases\u201d. \n \n4.1.1 Physical model \n \n\nThe model proposed in this work is based on a copper LHP, with \ncylindrical shaped evaporator, as shown in Figure 32. The evaporator \nhas two regions: the compensation chamber, with no porous media, and \nthe capillary pump region, of length l, internally recovered by a copper \npowder sintered wick layer, of thickness ?. A porous media plug of \nlength ? separates these regions (see Figure 32). The higher the pressure \ndifference between the compensation chamber and the liquid-vapor \nmeniscus interface, the better the system works. Therefore, the objective \nof the plug is, while allowing the liquid to reach the wick structure in the \nheated region of the evaporator, to decrease the heat leakage to the \ncompensation chamber, avoiding its temperature increases, which would \ndecrease the pressure difference and so disturb the LHP thermal \nperformance, eventually stopping the system operation. In other words, \nthe heat loss to the compensation chamber increases the working fluid \ntemperature, decreasing the difference between the temperatures of the \ncompensation chamber and of the evaporator meniscus. As a result, the \nworking fluid pressure difference between these same regions of the \nLHP decreases (see Maydanik et al. (2011b)). The configuration studied \nin this work, is similar to the novel oval evaporator proposed by \nMaydanik et al. (2011b), which has been successfully tested and \nconsidered as an alternative to the conventional evaporators, because \nthey allow for the use of copper and water. Actually, cooper is a \nmaterial usually avoided due to its high thermal conductivity that causes \nlarge heat losses to the compensation chamber. Besides, water is also \navoided because, despite of having good thermal properties such as high \nlatent heat of vaporization and surface tension, it presents low pressure \nsensibility to temperature variations, for low operation temperatures \n(below 70 oC). A simplified sketch of the evaporator is shown in Figure \n33. This evaporator works similarly as the conventional ones: the \ncondensate enters the evaporator through the liquid line and reaches the \ncompensation chamber, crosses the porous media plug, reaching the \ncapillary pumped region which external wall receives the heat power \n\n\n\n104 \n \n\ninput. In this work, the influence of the porous media layer ? and of the \ngeometric parameters ? and l, in the thermal performance of capillary \npumps in LHPs, are studied.  \n\n \nFigure 32 - Sketch of the LHP studied. \n\n \nAs already noted, heat power is delivered to the external area of the \n\nevaporator capillary pumping region, crossing the wall and reaching the \nwick structure. The wick must be designed so that the phase change \noccurs only in the liquid vapor meniscus (FAGHRI, 1995). In order to \nwork properly, vapor must not be trapped within the porous media. As \nthe vapor thermal conductivity is much lower than liquid\u00b4s, the thermal \nresistance of the evaporator can increase sensibly with the presence of \nvapor. In addition, vapor can cause working fluid pressure to increase \nand oscillate within the wick, disturbing the LHP behavior. Therefore, \nthe wick design should provide proper permeability and porosity, to \nallow the liquid to flow through the media and adequate thermal \nconductivity, to avoid the vapor to be formed within the layer, out of the \nmeniscus.  \n\nTherefore, the most probable location of the onset of undesirable \nvapor bubbles is in the interface between the porous media and the \ncasing wall, in the evaporator external wall heated region. So, if one is \nable to avoid the vapor formation in this interface, no vapor bubbles are \nexpected in any other evaporator region. In other words, the design of \nthe device should guarantee, for the specific power input under \nconsideration, that the temperature of the wick-casing wall interface is \nkept lower than the phase change temperature for liquid saturation \npressure inside the wick.  \n\n\n\n105 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 33 - Schematic of the evaporator. \n \n \n\n\n\n106 \n \n\n4.1.2 Evaporator geometry analyses \n \n\nIn actual applications, LHPs must be designed to satisfy several \noperation requirements, including working temperatures, capacity of \ntransferring heat for pre-established distances (between evaporators and \ncondensers) and geometric limitations, due to the volume or area \navailable for setting up the device. \n The main criterion adopted to design the geometry (length and \ndiameter) of the present studied LHP cylindrical evaporator is to \nprovide, to the heat source, enough external area to capture the heat to \nbe transferred. In addition, although pressure drops along the evaporator \nis not a subject treated in this work, the length of the evaporator must \nsatisfy the capillary pumping requirements of the LHP. Actually, one \nshould note that this wick must be thin enough to avoid the phase \nchange to happen inside the structure and large enough to provide \nworking fluid flow and capillary pumping capacity. However, it is not \nfound in the literature any mathematical expression to be used in order \nto select the appropriate wick thickness ?. The present work develops an \nexpression, based on geometric and thermophysical properties of the \nworking fluid and porous media, which can be used as a criterion for the \nselection of the appropriate thickness of the porous media (wick) \nstructure.  \n From the conservation of mass principle applied to the wick \nstructure, the following relation can be obtained:  \n\n z? ? ? z? \n  (4.1) \nwhere z? ?  and z? \n  represents the wick structure inlet and outlet working \nfluid mass flow rates, respectively. Two different velocity components \nare relevant in this model. The u axial velocity is related to the liquid \nflowing within the porous media and can be obtained from Darcy\u00b4s \nequation. The normal v velocity is related to the mass of liquid \nevaporated in the vapor-liquid interface and dependents on the heat flux \nthat reaches that interface. Using these velocities, Equation (4.1) can be \nrewritten as: \n  \n\n ?? x\\?L ? ?? }\\??  (4.2) \n \nwhere \\?L  and \\??  are the fluid flow normal areas, in the z and r \ndirections and ?l is the liquid. \n\n\n\n107 \n \n\n \n \n\nFrom Darcy\u00b4s law, one gets: \n \n\n \n|$|I ? ? v?w x (4.3) \n\n \nwhere \u00b5 l is the fluid viscosity and ? is the permeability of the media.  \n\nFrom this equation, one can solve for the velocity to get: \n \n\n x ? ? wv? |$|I  (4.4) \n \nIt can be noted that this relation take into account the pressure drop \nwithin the wick structure.  \n\nThe velocity v can be obtained from a mass balance on the meniscus \nliquid-vapor interface, assuming that all the heat supplied in the \nevaporator is used for the liquid-vapor phase change, in the meniscus \ninterface. So, one gets: \n\n   \n\n z? ? ???? (4.5) \n \nwhere hlv is the latent heat of vaporization and q is the heat applied. \nSubstituting the right side of Equation (4.2) in the above expression, one \ngets: \n\n ?? }\\?? ? ????

(4.10) \n \nSubstituting in Equation (4.9), and rearranging, one gets the \n\nfollowing relation between the wick thickness and its length:  \n\n =?? ?C ? 2[55?? ??? v?w =?$?)?\n+P\n\n (4.11) \n\nActually, the compensation chamber and the evaporator present \nslightly different saturated states, due to the temperature differences \nobserved along the LHP. These saturation states are thermodynamically \nlinked and must satisfy the relation (FAGHRI, 1995; KU, 1999; \nMAYDANIK et al., 2011): \n\n ?$ ? 4$4)?' ?) (4.12) \nwhich, also, can be written as: \n\n \n$? ? $\n\n)? ? )\n\n ? 4$4)?' (4.13) \n\nwhere Pv and Tv are the pressure and temperature of the evaporator, \nwhile Pcc and Tcc are pressure and temperature of the compensation \nchamber, respectively. The term dP/dT is the slope of the pressure-\ntemperature saturation line at T and this rate depends on the working \nfluid. High dP/dT values result in larger pressure gradients within the \nevaporator and so in larger evaporator capillary pumping capacity, \nresulting in larger temperature difference between the compensation \nchamber and the rest of the LHP. Therefore, it is evident that dP/dT \ncharacteristics of the working fluid must be considered in the geometry \ndesign of LHPs. The reference temperature T, for which the derivative is \ntaken, can be adopted as the compensation chamber temperature, as \nsuggested by Ku (1999), or as the average between the evaporator and \ncompensation chamber temperatures, as proposed by Faghri (1995). In \n\n\n\n109 \n \n\n \n \n\nthe present work, the evaporator temperature is adopted as the reference \noperation temperature. Then, from Equation (4.13), the term ?P/?T can \nbe expressed by:  \n\n =?)?$? ? =4$4)?' ?\n+P\n\n (4.14) \n\n \nFinally, Equation (4.11) can be written as: \n\n =?? ?C?\n?[\n![E??\n\n? 2[55w???\n? ??\n?[?E?[/\nv??? ????\n\n5???% ??\n?[?E?[/\n=4$4)?' ?\n\n+P\n???????'Z[?!\n%???!?\n  \n\n(4.15) \n\nThis equation provides a non-dimensional expression, involving \ngeometry, capillary structure plus working fluid thermophysical \nproperties and thermodynamic state of the working fluid, which can be \nused for the design of the wick structure thickness. The last term of \nEquation (4.15) can be calculated using the Clausius - Clapeyron \nEquation. In this work, the derivate of the pressure as function of the \ntemperature is obtained from the FAGHRI (1995) polynomium.  \n One should note that the present model is useful not only to the LHP \nevaporator geometry under investigation in this work but also to \nconventional evaporators (FAGHRI, 1995; KU, 1999), see Figure 34, \nwhere Equation (4.15) can be used to determine the ratio between the \nevaporator wick thickness and its length l (?/l), which guarantees the \nLHP start up.  \n \n\n \n\nFigure 34 - Typical cross section of convectional evaporator of loop heat pipes \na). Wick structure fin, b) solid fin. \n\na) \n\nb) \n\n\n\n110 \n \n\n4.2 Loop heap pipe evaporator mathematical models \n \nAs already mentioned, the porous media have two objectives: to \n\nprovide a controlled means for working fluid evaporation and at the \nsame time, to provide the capillary pumping necessary for conducting \nthe fluid along the device. Therefore, the evaporator must be designed to \nguarantee that the heat delivered is able to reach the working fluid \nliquid\u2013vapor meniscus formed, in the present configuration, in the most \ninternal layer of the porous media. Also, the design should avoid vapor \nformation within the wick structure.  \n Therefore, thermal models for the temperature distribution within \nevaporator wick structure, able to predict the power transferred through \nthe wick structure and the hot spots and hydraulic models, able to \ndetermine the pressure distribution (and so the pumping capacity of the \nevaporator) are important design tool of efficient LHP evaporators. \n In the first part of this section, heat conduction models, to determine \nthe temperature distribution and the heat transferred for the evaporator \nof LHPs are developed and presented. In the second part, hydraulic \nmodels able to predict the pressure distribution are developed and \nshown. These models are used in the design of evaporators of LHPs as \ndiscussed in the next chapter.  \n \n4.2.1 Wick structure thermal models \n \n\nIn the section, the wick, of thickness ? and length l which includes \nthe heated and insulated lengths ? of the capillary pumping structure, \nand wick plug length ? are modeled (see Figure 33). Two-dimensional \ncylindrical coordinates were adopted, with the z axis located in the axis \nof cylindrical wick and the r axis located radial to the wick thickness \ndirection, resulting in the physical model shown in Figure 35.  \n The following hypotheses were adopted:  \n\n\u2022 Steady state conditions; \n\u2022 Isotropic wick structure; \n\u2022 Solid and liquid uniform thermophysical properties; \n\u2022 The evaporator ()?) and compensation chamber ()\n\n) \n\ntemperatures are prescribed, in saturation state, where )? >)\n\n. \n \n\n\n\n111 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 35 - Sketch of the evaporator thermophysical model. \n \n\nThe sketch of the heat transfer physical model, presented in Figure \n35, shows the following boundary conditions: \n\n\u2022 Prescribed temperature ()? ), at z=0. The working fluid \nwithin the compensation chamber, in its saturated state, \ncontains both liquid and vapor phases. \n\n\u2022 Thermal insulation at (|) |>? ? 0), at z=v. This boundary \ncondition means that the heat transfer is negligible at end of \nthe evaporator wall.  \n\n\u2022 For > ? ?, thermal insulation (|) |I? ? 0) for 0 ? I ? ?. \nThis assumes that whole heat supplied in the heated surface \nis transferred or to the wick meniscus and or to the \ncompensation chamber. The heat transfer in the wick plug \nand vapor regions interface is negligible. \n\n\u2022 Heat flux is known ( 2 |) |> ? ^??? , for ? ? I ? ?). \n\u2022 Prescribed temperature ()?), at ? ?. This temperature \n\ncorresponds to the saturated temperature of the vapor \nproduced in the meniscus interface.  \n\n\u2022 Liquid-vapor phase change happens only at the meniscus \nformed in the interface between liquid and vapor, in the \nwick structure (> ? ?) (FAGHRI, 1995). \n\n\n\n112 \n \n\n\u2022 Heat is supplied to the evaporator external wall and reaches \nthe liquid-vapor interface, due to the high thermal \nconductivity of the porous media solid matrix (FAGHRI, \n1995). The physical mechanism is shown in Figure 36. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 36 - Sketch of the evaporator thermophysical model. \n\n \n\u2022 All the heat transferred by the wick structure to the liquid-\n\nvapor interface is used for changing the phase of the \nworking fluid. Also, the evaporation thermal resistance is \nmuch lower than the conduction thermal resistance of the \nsintered porous media, which effective thermal conductivity \nis keff. \n \n\nIn this 2D model, the heat transfer through the evaporator case was \nneglected, in behalf of the design safety. A percentage of the heat flux is \ntransferred through of case, but, by considering that the whole heat \npasses only through the wick structure, the maximum possible \ntemperature is determined. As the actual temperature is lower than the \ncalculated one, the liquid is colder that the saturation temperature, which \nis in favor of safety. Therefore, only the heat leak to the compensation \nchamber through the plug wick was considered. Adiabatic boundary \ncondition at z = ? for 0 &lt;r &lt;? was assumed as the heat transfer in this \nface is small and so no evaporation is expected at this interface.

This means that \nthe heat should not flow to any other LHP component, especially the \ncompensation chamber, where the heat leakage would increase the \nliquid temperature and so its pressure, decreasing the pressure drops \nalong the LHP sections, which would, eventually prevent LHP operation \nor its start up. The present model provides a tool to verify, from the total \nenergy delivered to the evaporator, the amount that is transferred to the \nliquid-vapor meniscus (conducted through the porous media hollow \ncylinder) and the heat lost to the compensation chamber (through the \nplug solid cylinder).  \n\n\n\n130 \n \n\nIn steady state conditions, a simple heat balance within the \nevaporator establishes that the total energy delivered to the evaporator. \nThis heat energy can be split into the one transferred to the meniscus \ninterface qr|r=?

The heat leak and heat used to evaporate the working fluid are \nalso determined. A wick structure coupled to condenser, and liquid and \nvapor lines are modeled for one operation condition. \n \n4.2.2 Pressure distribution models \n \n\nThe hydraulic behavior of the porous structure is modeled aiming the \ndevelopment of a tool for designing LHP wicks which are able to \npromote the working fluid pumping and phase change along the loop \n(see Figure 44). The following hypothesis were adopted: \n\n\u2022 The liquid-vapor phase change happens only at the \ninterface between liquid and vapor, in the wick structure, \naccording to Faghri (1995). It is considered that the heat \nsupplied to the evaporator reaches the liquid-vapor \ninterface due to the high thermal conductivity of the solid \nmatrix in the porous media Fl\u00f3rez et al. (2013).  \n\n\u2022 All the heat transferred by the wick structure to the liquid-\nvapor interface is used for the working fluid phase change; \ntherefore, the evaporation thermal resistance is much \nsmaller than the conductance thermal resistance through \nthe sintered porous media. \n\n\u2022 The fluid has uniform velocity within the compensation \nchamber. \n\n\u2022 The working fluid is incompressible. \n\u2022 Gravity effects are negligible. \n\u2022 The fluid that flows within the wick structure is laminar \n\nand has Reynolds number Re &lt;1 (DYBBS; EDWARDS, \n1984), therefore Darcy\u00b4s equation is applied. The Reynolds \nnumber is based on the average velocity within the pore \nand its characteristic dimension is the pore diameter.  \n\nSimilar to the temperature distributions, the pressure field is also \nobtained from the solution of Laplace\u2019s Equation, which results from the \n\n\n\n134 \n \n\nmass conservation principle and the Darcy law applied for each \ncomponent of the coordinate system (BEJAN, 2013; FAGHRI, 1995).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 44 - Sketch of the evaporator hydraulic model. \n \nThe velocity is assumed to be  \n \n\n \u00e7 ? 7?? ?? ? 7?\u00e9 ?\u00e9 ? 7?? ?L, (4.108) \n \nThe Darcy law can be written, in vector notation, as: \n\n \u00e7 ? ?

Figure 45 shows these boundary conditions for the \nsolid cylinder, which are: prescribed compensation chamber pressure Pcc \nat z = 0, hermetic conditions (no pressure gradient) at the evaporator \ncase wall, r = ?, symmetry condition at r = 0.

(subdomain 2 e 3, see Figure 45) is chosen, for \nwhich results a temperature distribution T?(r). This solid cylinder \ntemperature distribution T?(r) is used as the prescribed temperature \ndistribution boundary condition for the hollow cylinder (domain 3) and \na new heat transfer ratio q? in the interface at z = ? and ? ? > ? ? is \ncalculated. If the difference between the heat transfer ratio for domains 2 \nand 3, and the q? considered in the interface at z = ? and ? ? > ? ? is \nless than 0.01 W, the convergence is achieved. Otherwise, a new heat \nratio q? is chosen and the procedure is repeated. In Figure 51 and Figure \n52, the temperature distributions of the wick structure, which geometry \nis described in Table 9, are shown. With this temperature distribution, \ntogether with the pressure field (to be presented in the following \nsection), one is able to make a thermodynamic analysis of the \nevaporator wick structure operation. \n\nIn Figure 51, one can see that temperature distribution in the solid \ncylinder presents a close to unidimensional behavior in the r direction. \nHowever, in the region close to the coupling with the solid cylinder, the \nisothermal lines show a bidimensional behavior, evidencing a heat leak \nto the compensation chamber. One can also see that the temperature \ndistribution due to the boundary conditions in the vapor region are \ncoherent with the physical model (hypothesis) with exception to the left \nlower region, due to the coupling of two different boundary conditions \n(insulation in the solid cylinder and prescribed temperature in the \nhollow cylinder).  \n \n\n \n\n\n\n153 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 51 - Contours of temperature field of LHP described in Table 9.

Similarly, the numerical solution for these equations are \nobtained using the Maple software. Unlike the thermal solution, the \npressure field for each domain is solved separately. The convergence for \nFourier series solution was also obtained with 150 terms. In Figure 53 \nand Figure 54, the field and gradient of pressure to geometry study are \nshown for all domains. The pressure drop in domain 3 presents the \nhighest pressure drop for this configuration. The pressure drop in the \ndomain 4-5 represents approximately the 30 % of the total pressure drop \nin the wick. The pressure field coupled to temperature field allows to \nevaluate the performance of the wick geometry proposed applied in the \nLHP evaporator. This model will be used in the chapter 5 in order to \nanalysis the thermal and hydraulic performance of the wick structure.  \n \nTable 12 Equations summary for solution of pressure field  \n\nSolid cylinder  \n\n???>, I? ? \u00a8 S! \u00a6??\u00fb! >?\u00a9!\u00aaP sin?\u00fb!

In the Figure 51, one can see that the interface between the solid \nand hollow cylinder is in a critical region for this geometry, where the \nreduction of transversal area due to vapor formation can increase the \npressure drop, reducing the capacity of heat transfer of LHP. \n\n\n\n160 \n \n\n  \n\nReay and Kew (2006) present one equation based on the non-\nhomogeneous nucleation theory for commonly wick structures used in \nthe heat pipes HP, expressed as: \n\n \n\n ?) ? 3.06?? )\u00a3?\u00d9?? ??? ?'  (4.210) \n \nwhere ?l is the superficial tension, ?v is the fluid density, hlv is the heat \nlatent of fluid and ?T is the thermal boundary layer thickness defined \nfrom model of Hsu (1962). This thickness is taken as 25 ?m for a typical \nheat pipe evaporator. \n\nFor the geometry analyzed and described in the Table 9, the pressure \nand temperature on the compensation chamber are 18.6 kPa and 58.7 \n\u00b0C, respectively. For the point (?,?) where the maximum temperature \nand minimal pressure is achieved by the working fluid, we have that \nT(?,?)=78.02 and P(?,?)=18.18 kPa. Here, for a water distillate at a \ntemperature of 58.02 \u00b0C, the ?Tcrit defined by Equation (4.210) is \n9.63\u00b0C. On the other hand, the superheating for the point (?,?) is 20, \nthus as ?T > ?Tcrit, bubbles are formed inside this point. The same \nevaluation can be made for the geometry and to determine which \nregions are occupied by bubbles. From this analysis is possible to \ndetermine if a geometry proposed for a power load will be affected by \nthe presence partial or total of bubbles that increase the area to mass and \nheat transfer.  \n\nIn the chapter 5, same analysis will be applied to the geometry of the \nwick evaporator studied.  \n \n4.3 Loop heat pipe operation model \n\n \n In the last section, two bi-dimensional mathematical models were \nproposed to analyze the thermal and hydraulic behavior of the wick \nstructure located within evaporators of LHPs. Obviously, the evaporator \nis the major component of a LHP and the geometry of the porous media \nlocated inside it has major influence in the performance of the device. \nTherefore, sophisticated detailed models are of prime importance, as the \nonset of LHP failure (usually by dry-out) commonly starts due to the \nundesired vapor formation in very specific points or regions of the \nevaporator.  However, electric analogy steady state simple models may \nbe useful in the determination of LHP operation temperature (usually \ndefined as the compensation chamber temperatures) and of the \n\n\n\n161 \n \n\n \n\nmaximum the system is able to transfer.  Kaya et al. (1999) employed \nthermal circuit analogy models to determine the operation temperature \nof cylindrical loop heat pipes. Later, Singh et al. (2009) also used these \nmodels to describe the operation of heat pipe with plane evaporator. \n  \n\n \nFigure 56 - Sketch of the equivalent thermal circuit of the loop heat pipe. \n\n \nThe sketch of the equivalent thermal circuit of the loop heat pipes \n\nproposed in this thesis is present in the Figure 56. In this circuit, the heat \nqH, delivered to the evaporator external wall (at temperature Th) has two \ndifferent paths to follow. In one path, represented by Rw, heat is \ndelivered to the wick structure and is transferred up to the wick working \nfluid meniscus, where phase change takes place, at temperature Tv. In \nthe other path, heat is conducted to the compensation chamber through \nthe evaporator casing wall (resistance Rc) at temperature Tcc. The heat \n\n\n\n162 \n \n\n  \n\ntransferred in this second path is undesired, and so, considered as a heat \nloss. However, heat can also be lost to the compensation chamber \ndirectly through the wick plug (solid cylinder) through the R? thermal \nresistance. Finally, also through the casing and other materials that \ncompose the LHP, heat qs can be exchanged directly between the \ncompensation chamber and the liquid lines. The vapor and liquid lines \nare considered adiabatic. The net sensible heat qL transported by the \nvapor through the liquid line is eventually removed in the condenser \nregion of the LHP.  \n\nFigure 57 shows the evaporator equivalent circuit. The circuit is \ncomposed of three thermal resistances: hollow wick radial resistance R?, \nsolid wick plug resistance R? and evaporator case Rc, representing the \nheat path between the evaporator section and the compensation \nchamber. In Figure 57, one can be also observe the heat transfer rates at \neach branch of the circuit. The applied power qH is delivered to the \nexternal wall of the evaporator section: part of the heat is transferred to \ncompensation chamber (heat leak, qs), through the case wall and wick \nplug. In order to obtain a good performance from the device, it is \nexpected that this heat leak should be compensated by the working fluid \nthat entering the compensation chamber in subcooled liquid state. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 57 - Sketch of the thermal equivalent circuit of the loop heat pipe \n\nevaporator. \n \n\n\n\n163 \n \n\n \n\nAn energy balance can be performed at each node of the circuit.

The condenser pressure drop and the output \ntemperature of the condensate influence the operation temperature of LHP. \nTherefore, one important parameter is the length of the condenser. This \nlength is used to calculate the pressure drop due to the working fluid phase \nchange and in the transport of subcooled liquid.  \n\nIn this section, mathematical models are proposed to determine the \nphase change length in LHP condenser. For modelling purposes, the \ncondenser is considered divided into two regions: the first used to transfer \nlatent heat (and so to cause phase change) and second to transfer sensible \nheat (and so, to subcool the condensate). \n \n4.5.1 Heat transfer analysis \n\n \n\nFigure 58 - Schematics of the divisions of the condenser. \n \n\nThe condenser configuration studied in this work consists of a U \nshaped bent tube, welded on a flat copper plate (see Figure 58), with the \nworking fluid flowing through this tube. The copper plate is attached to \nan aluminum block. The aluminum block has channels inside, where \nwater flows through it. The temperature of water is controlled by a \nthermostatic bath. Figure 59 shows a schematic of the tube, the plate \ncross section and the welding material, which connects them. For \nmodelling purposes, the tube is considered straight, with the external \n\n\n\n166 \n \n\n  \n\nface subjected to convection heat transferred to the ambient air. A \nthermal resistance network is constructed to model the heat transfer \nbetween the tube and ambient air, as also shown in Figure 59.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 59 - Condenser latent heat transfer analysis. \n \n\nTo calculate the condenser tube length, where the liquid changes phase, \na heat balance over the condenser region is performed:  \n\n \n\n ^?? ? ??y \\? ?)/?E ? )/ ?

Literature models are also presented and will be used to predict \nthe performance of the LHP in the next chapter. Two approaches were \nused for the mathematical model development: 2D and 1D. The 2D \nmodeling was proposed to study and determine geometry parameters \nthat will guarantee the correct performance and to allow for the design \nof the evaporator wick structure of LHP. The temperature and pressure \nfields allow for the identification of the dimensions of the wick structure \nable to prevent LHP dry out. From the 1D model approach, a critical \ntheoretical parameter, which allows for the selection of the evaporator \ngeometry and operation mode, was proposed. The analogy between \nthermal and electrical circuit was used to determine the operation \n\n\n\n174 \n \n\n  \n\ntemperature and heat transfer limits. Several literature models to \ndetermine the heat transfer and pressure drops in LHP components, such \nas evaporator, liquid and vapor lines, were also presented.  \n  \n\n\n\n175 \n \n\n \n\n5 EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL ANALISIS OF LHP \n\nIn this chapter, an analysis of the geometry design of the wick \nstructure of the loop heat pipe is presented. The thermal and hydraulic \n2D models proposed in the last chapter are used to evaluate the \ninfluence of geometrical and thermophysical properties of the capillary \nstructure on the performance of the evaporator. A difference of \ntemperature higher than the critical temperature leads to the formation \nof vapor within the wick structure and increases both the thermal \nresistance and the operation temperature. Additionally, the heat leak to \nthe compensation chamber increases the temperature of the working \nfluid, reducing the thermodynamic drive force between evaporator \nregion and the compensation chamber. On the other hand, a large \npressure drop in the wick structure reduces the heat transfer capacity of \nthe equipment. Therefore, the geometry design of the wick structure \nmust guarantee the appropriate difference of temperature between the \nheater and evaporation zone, resulting in a small heat leakage to the \ncompensation chamber, and the minimum pressure drop in the wick \nstructure.  \n\nIn order to analyze the influence of the geometry parameters in the \ndesign of LHPs, the tools developed in chapters 3 and 4 of this work are \nused to design two LHPs. In the first section, a design procedure is \nproposed, based on two copper powders with different average particle \ndiameters, selected to be used in the fabrication of the sintered porous \nmedia. In the second section, the experimental work developed to \nvalidate the hypotheses formulated from the experimental design is \npresented. In the last section, the 1D model, which is based on the \nelectrical circuit analogy is compared with experimental evaporator \noperation temperatures.   \n\n \n5.1 Loop heat pipe design methodology \n\n \nFigure 61 presents the main steps proposed to design an evaporator \n\nfor a loop heat pipe. Four fundamental aspects are considered: \nrequirements, working fluid, wick structure, and heat and mass transfer.   \n\nThe fist block shows the requirements of the design divided in two \ntypes: geometry and operation. The available area to transfer the heat Ae, \nand the distance L between the source and heat sink are the geometric \nrequirements or constrictions. The operation temperature To and the \npower transferred qe are the operational requirements. They are related \n\n\n\n176 \n \n\n  \n\nto the conditions for safe operation of the electronic device or heat \nsource that need thermal control.  \n\nAfter defining the initial geometry parameters, the working fluid \nmust be selected, according to the operation temperature. In the thermal \ncontrol of electronic devices, methanol, ethanol and water are frequently \nused as working fluids. As mentioned in the chapter 2, the working fluid \nmust also be chemically compatible with the wick and case material to \navoid the formation of non-condensable gases.  \n The following steps are used to define the geometrical dimensions of \nthe wick structure. Once the heat transfer area is established according \nto the application, it is possible to know the minimal active length of the \nevaporator. Equation (4.15) can be used to establish the critical ratio ?/l \nand so the thickness of the wick structure. Then, the thermal and \npressure fields can be obtained using the 2D-model to determine the \ntemperature distribution and pressure drops in the wick structure and to \nevaluate the performance of the geometry. As mentioned in chapter 4, \nthe pressure field in the wick structure is coupled with the temperature \nfield by the boundary condition in the evaporation surface. The \nthermophysical properties can be evaluated from the proposed models or \nexperimental data. The wick structure should provide the heat and mass \ntransfer to the evaporation region and to avoid, as much as possible, heat \nleakage to the compensation chamber. The 2D-model allows for the \nanalysis of the behavior of wick structure in the worst operation \nconditions, guaranteeing a safe design for the application of the LHP. \n After that the geometrical dimensions are determined, if the \ntemperature distribution and pressure field are well behaved, the loop \nheat pipe performance can be determined using the 1D-model. \nAccording to Maydanik et al. (2011b), the failure of these devices \noccurs when the vapor is produced inside the wick structure. The \npresence of vapor within the porous media occurs due to the insufficient \ncapillary pumping (able to continuously refill the whole wick structure) \nand to the superheating of the liquid above the critical temperature. The \ntemperature criterion is evaluated using the 2D model. To determine the \ncapillary limit, all pressure drops in the loop must be calculated, \nincluding the pressure drop of the wick structure. The first \napproximation to determine the fluid inventory is to consider that all \nheat applied is transferred to evaporation zone. The operation \ntemperature is obtained from the heat balance equation, when the ratio \nbetween the total pressure and temperature in the wick is equal to slope \nof the pressure-temperature curve, at the temperature of operation. \n\n\n\n177 \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 61 - Design procedure for loop heap pipe. \n \n. \n\n\n\n178 \n \n\n  \n\n5.5.1 Evaporator active section \n \nFrom the measurements performed with the defined type of powders \n\nand from the models developed, it can be concluded that for an average \nparticle diameter smaller than 20 ?m, permeability and effective thermal \nconductivity are not adequate to be used in the fabrication of the \nevaporator of a LHP. From this particle type, the permeability begins to \ndecrease and the thermal conductivity increases. Low permeability \nincreases the pressure drop inside of wick structure, thus reduces the \nheat transfer capacity. On the other hand, high effective thermal \nconductivity increases the heat leak to compensation chamber, \nincreasing the possibility to form vapor in the compensation chamber. \nThe wick geometry should be designed to provide an equilibrium of the \nresponse of this property in the heat and mass transfer, minimizing the \npressure drop and heat leak. \n\nThe following study has the objective to identify the effects of each \none property, comparing two types of powder and the wick parameters \ngeometries (length of bottom ? and thickness of the wick active zone ?) \non the performance of the LHP evaporator. Therefore, the temperature \ndistribution is obtained from the 2D-model presented in chapter 4 and its \nmaximum temperature and the heat leakage are determined. Table 13 \npresents a summary of the thermophysical properties of the wick \nstructure, fabricated using powders B and C, measured in the laboratory.  \n\n \nTable 13.

The plots of the ratio ? ?? , Equation \n(4.15), as a function of the evaporator temperature are shown in the \nFigure 62 for a wick structure whose parameters are given by Table 13, \nand for two different working fluids: water and methanol. In this figure, \n\n\n\n179 \n \n\n \n\nthe value of ?/l for water at 60 \u00b0C is highlighted for both powder \nstructures. These values will be used in the design of the LHP to be \ntested experimentally in the next section. In the Figure 62, one can see \nthat, as the reference temperature decreases, thicker wick structures are \nnecessary. In addition, one can also observe that methanol requires \nthinner wicks than water for a same reference temperature.  \n\nTo understand this behavior, each term of the critical relation ?/l \nequation (Equation (4.15), here reproduced) are compared, for both \nworking fluids: \n\n \n\n AL? BC?\n?[\n![E??\n\n? ?\u00b7\u00b8\u00b8\u00beM??\n? ??\n?[?E?[/\n\u00ebXNXZX*O\n\n5???% ??\n?[?E?[/ A%&amp;%'(' B+P???????'Z[?!\n%???!?\n  , (4.15) \n \nOne can see that the first term is the similar for both liquids, because, \n\naccording to Florez et al. (2013), the influence of the liquid in the \neffective thermal conductivity is negligible The second term \ncorresponds to the working fluid thermophysical properties and, besides \nthe liquid dynamic viscosity and density for water and methanol are not \nvery different, the latent heat of water is approximately twice the latent \nheat of methanol. This means that more methanol than water is expected \nto be evaporated for the same heat load. As the evaporated fluid must be \nreplenished, more methanol is expected to be flow through the wick and \nso higher pressure drops for methanol are expected. Considering only \nthis effect, methanol could need of a thicker wick, for the same heat \nload. However, this behavior is compensated by the last term, related to \nthe slope of the curve pressure-temperature, which, for water is around \nfour times smaller than methanol\u00b4s, for the temperature level analyzed. \n\n\n\n180 \n \n\n  \n\n \na) \n\n \nb) \n\nFigure 62 - Ratio of wick thickness to evaporator length (? ?? ) as a function of \nthe operation temperature. a) Powder B, b) Powder C.  \n\n \n5.1.2 Design of the tested LHP geometries \n\n \nThe constructed LHP was made of copper and consisted of: an \n\nevaporator (with similar geometry to the one shown in Figure 63; a \ncondenser (three-turn coil, made of conventional tubes of 1.62 mm of \n\n280 300 320 340 360 380 400\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\n \n\n \n\nX: 333\n\nY : 0.0594\n\nTemperature [K]\n\n?/\nl\n\nwater\n\nmethanol\n\n280 300 320 340 360 380 400\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\n0.45\n\n0.5\n\n \n\n \n\nX: 333\n\nY : 0.1094\n\nTemperature [K]\n\n?/\nl\n\nwater\n\nmethanol\n\n\n\n181 \n \n\n \n\ninternal diameter); a liquid line (straight tube with one elbow and one \nturn) and a vapor line (straight tube with one elbow).

Statistical tools are used to study the influence of the \ngeometric parameters on the thermal performance of evaporators of the \nLHP geometry under study (see Figure 63), with wicks made from the \nporous media described in Table 10. The values for the maximum \ntemperature Tmax and the heat leak qcc are used as the response variables. \nThe following parameters were selected for this analysis: the type of \nsintered porous media based on the different values of powder average \nparticle diameter, ratio between evaporator thickness ? and evaporator \nlength l (?/l), and ratio between the bottom evaporator length ? and \nevaporator length l, (?/l). Two levels (higher (+) and lower (-)) were \nselected for each parameter or factor. The levels for the parameter ? \n(which depends on the fluid, as established by equation (4.15)), were \nemployed in this study, considering water as the working fluid. Table 15 \nshows the parameter values adopted in this study. The combination of \nthese variable levels results in 23 = 8 experiments of a factorial \nstatistical design.

The heaters were fed \nby a controlled electric energy source equipment.

The steady state \nconditions are considered achieved when the variations of all the \nmonitored temperatures are smaller than 1oC. The evaporator \ntemperatures (thermocouples T11, T12, T13 and T14, see Figure 69 for \nlocation) show obviously, the higher levels, while the condenser \n\n\n\n193 \n \n\n \n\n(thermocouples T3, T4, T5, T6 and T7) show lower temperatures. The \nstartup of the device is characterized by the temperatures T1, T2 and T3 \nsudden increase. One can see that, for the first power input of 5 W, the \nLHP took around 2000 seconds to start up, which can be observed when \nthe liquid line temperatures (Thermocouples T8, T9 and T10) starts to \ndecrease, which means that the condensate reached the liquid line close \nto the compensation chamber (in other words, the working fluid cycle is \nclosed). After that, the system operated for the power inputs of 10, 15, \n20 and 25 W, showing better performances (the temperature difference \nbetween evaporator and condenser decreases), for higher power inputs. \nAfter 30 W, the system stopped working.

The thermal behavior of this LHP with water is shown in \nFigure 71, for the same conditions tested in Figure 70. One can easily \nsee from this plot that the LHP did not work with water.

Comparing Cases A and B (see Table 20), one can \nobserve that these LHP\u2019s have basically the same geometry \nconfiguration, with the major difference being the wick thickness. \nFigure 72 shows the thermal behavior of Case B. In this figure, one can \nsee that the startup was possible only after the application of 15W after \napproximately 2500 seconds, when the temperatures T1, T2 and T3 \nstarts a sudden increase. The LHP operated quite well up to 60 W of \npower input. Actually, the thermal performance of the device increased \nfrom 15 to 60 W, which can be observed by the decreasing of the \ntemperature difference between evaporator and condenser. After this \npower level, the LHP started to show indications that the operational \nlimits were close, as temperature pulses are observed for thermocouple \nT4, located in the condenser serpentine, near to condenser entry region, \nshowing the presence of vapor. This means that, probably, the condenser \nis reaching its heat transfer limit before the evaporator. The plots of \nFigure 70, Figure 71 and Figure 72 show that the proposed model for \nthe determination of the thickness of the porous media, among other \nusages, gives a good estimative of this parameter and should be used as \na design tool for LHPs and heat pipes. \n\n\n\n195 \n \n\n \n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 10000\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nT\ne\n\nm\np\n\ne\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n(\u00b0\nC\n\n)\n\nt(s)\n\n T1   T2    T3   T4   \n\n T5   T6    T7   T8\n\n T9   T10  T11  T12\n\n T13  T14  T15\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nP\no\n\nw\ne\nr(\n\nW\n)\n\n \n\nFigure 72 - Thermal behavior of the LHPs described in Table 20, operating with \nwater (case B). \n\n \n5.3 Validation of the mathematical model  \n\n \nIn this section, the temperature distribution obtained by the \n\nmathematical model is compared with the numerical simulation results. \nCommercial software Ansys was used in this study.

This numerical \nstudy is used in the validation of the theoretical model. The simulations \nwere considered converged when the RMS residue (difference in the \ntemperatures for two consecutive iterations for all elements) was less \nthan 1x10-6.

Actually, this difference \ncan be imputed to the discretization error, which is a function of the \nnumber of mesh elements employed, as well as the approximation of \nuniform flux used to couple of solid and hollow cylinder.  \n\nThe temperature and heat transfer data shown in Table 22 were \nobtained using 7.81x106 mesh elements. To obtain the same precision, \naround 300 terms of the Fourier series were employed, demanding lower \ncomputational processing time than that required for the numerical \nsimulations. \n\nFigure 73 shows the 3D numerical temperature distribution of the \nwick structure studied. One can see from this figure that the temperature \nfield is basically 2D and that the 2D hypothesis adopted to the analytical \nmodel is quite precise. \n \n\n\n\n197 \n \n\n \n\nTable 22.

One can observe from \nthis figure that the temperature distributions show very similar \nbehaviors. The largest temperature gradients are observed vertically, \nfrom the top to the bottom direction (heat delivery surface to the \nmeniscus direction). In the area behind the heated region (right), the \ntemperature field has a quasi-one-dimensional behavior. Two larger \ndirection variations are actually observed in the insulated left region of \nthe evaporator (solid cylinder). Note that the numerical simulation map \n(upper map in Figure 73) is drawn observing the geometry of the actual \nwick structure studied. The comparison between theoretical model and \nnumerical simulation results can also be observed from the temperature \nprofile plots, for two porous media cross sections, vertical and \nhorizontal lines shown in Figure 74. \n \n\n\n\n198 \n \n\n  \n\n \n \n\nFigure 74 - Cross section position for the plots shown in Figure 35. \n \n Figure 74 shows the comparison between temperatures, obtained \nfrom analytical and numerical models, as a function of z at r = 5.6 mm \nand as a function of r at z = 7.89 mm. One can see from these plots that \nthe temperature curves are quite similar for r = 5.6 mm, considering \nboth temperature level and distribution. The average difference between \ntheoretical and numerical simulation models is around 0.9 \u00b0C, \nequivalent to 1.5 % (modulus of the ratio of the difference between \nmaximum theoretical and numerical temperatures and the maximum \nnumerical temperature), showing the good quality of the model. In the \nother hand, the temperature curves for z = 7.89 mm show that the \ndifference between temperatures increase as r increases. The highest \ndifference is 1.51 \u00b0C, equivalent to 2.4 %. This difference can be \nexplained by the effect of the hypothesis of uniform heat flux used to \ncouple the two domains, in the analytical solution.   \n Concluding this section, one can see that the theoretical model was \nable to reproduce the heat fluxes at the evaporation surfaces, the heat \nleaks and the temperature distribution along the wick structure. \nTherefore, the theoretical model can be considered validated, showing \nthat this model can be used in the design of the LHP evaporators.  \n In the next section, a complete LHP, using the designed evaporator, \nwas constructed and tested. Also, the testing results are discussed.   \n  \n\n\n\n199 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 75 - Comparison between numerical and analytical temperature \nprofiles for radial (above) and longitudinal (below) cross sections, \n\naccording to positions shown on Figure 74.  \n \n \n\n\n\n200 \n \n\n  \n\n5.4 Temperature and pressure fields analysis \n \n\nThis section presents an analysis of the temperature and the pressure \nfields. Thermal and hydrodynamic responses of the wick geometry \nshown in Table 20 (case B) is modeled using the equations developed in \nchapter 4 for a power load of 70 W. The pressure drop in the loop \ncalculated from the pressure models in the condenser, liquid and vapor \nlines are used to determine the boundary condition for the thermal \nmodel. The properties of the working fluid were calculated at 60\u00b0C. The \nobjective of the analyses is to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed \ngeometry to operate under the thermal power of 70 W, and to evaluate \nthe presence of vapor bubbles inside the wick structure, the heat leak \nand pressure a maximum temperature. Figure 76, Figure 77, Figure 78, \nand Figure 79 present the contours and surfaces of the temperature and \npressure field for the wick geometry described in Table 20 (case B). \n\n \n\n\n\n201 \n \n\n \n\n \n \n(b) \n\n(a) \n \n\n \n\nFigure 76 - Contours of temperature field of LHP described in Table 20, (a) Domains 1 and 2, (b) Domain 3. \n\n\n\n202 \n \n\n  \n\n \n(a) \n\n \n(b) \n\n \n\nFigure 77 - Surfaces of temperature field of LHP described in Table 20, (a) \nDomains 1 and 2, (b) Domain 3. \n\n \n\nT14 = 61.5 \u00b0C \n\nT12= 57.05 \u00b0C \n\n\n\n203 \n \n\n \n\n (b)  \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 78 - Contours of pressure field of LHP described in Table 20, (a) Domains 4 and 5, (b) Domain 6.       \n\n\n\n204 \n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 79 \u2013 Pressure gradients of LHP described in Table 20, (a) Domains 4 and 5, (b) Domain 6. \n\n \n\nz [mm] a) \n\nb) \n\nr \n[m\n\nm\n] \n\n\n\n205 \n \n\n \n\nThe thermodynamic equilibrium was evaluated for a vapor \ntemperature of 60 \u00b0C using the Equation (2.4) and for a power input of \n70 W. In the interface between the domains 1-2 and 3 for the point (?,?), \nthe maximum temperature was 60.43 \u00b0C. This value shows that heating \nat the interface is very low. Therefore, the evaporation in the interface is \nsmall for this power load. The heat ratio that crosses the interface at z=? \nand ? &lt;r &lt;? calculated from the equations presented in Table 11 was \n0.85 W, which represents only 1.2 % of the total power applied into the \nheating surface. As shown by the ANOVA analysis, the heat leak is very \nlow due to the strong temperature gradient in the radial direction of the \nhollow cylinder domain. From the Figure 77a and Figure 77b for the \ndomain 3, one can see that maximum temperature at point (?,?) is 63.4 \n\u00b0C. For the same wick geometry, the contours and gradients of the \npressure field are presented in the Figure 78 and Figure 79. As one can \nsee, the highest-pressure drop is in the domain 6 and it is about 64 % of \nthe total pressure for this wick structure evaporator. In Figure 78b, the \npressure at point (?,?) is 17.02 kPa. \n\nThe total pressure drop should be smaller than the maximum \ncapillary pressure of the LHP under operation. The pressure drop \nincreases with the power load until the pumping capacity is achieved. \nThis condition is called the capillary limit. However, the pressure drop \nincrease is also produced by the presence of vapor inside of the wick \nstructure that blocks the working fluid flow to the evaporative surface. \nTherefore, it is necessary to evaluate whether the thermodynamic state \ninside of wick structure is above the critical conditions where vapor is \nformed. In Figure 80, the thermodynamic state of the compensation \nchamber, the vapor zone and the point (?,?) of the wick structure are \nplotted in the P-T diagram for water. From this figure, one can see that \nthe temperature at the point (?,?) is higher than the temperature of \nsaturation corresponding to pressure 17.02 kPa. Hence, the working \nfluid (water) at this point is a superheated liquid with (Tl \u2013 Tsat) = 6.72 \n\u00b0C. To determine if bubbles can be formed in this condition, the \nsuperheating (Tl \u2013 Tsat) should be compared to the superheating criteria. \nSuperheating approach from homogeneous nucleation is very high to \ninitiate the boiling at liquid-solid interface (CAREY, 2007). Usually, the \nliterature presents criteria based on the theory of heterogeneous \nnucleation, which is the nucleation at the interface between the fluid in \nmetastable state and a solid phase contacting it. The critical difference \nof temperature using Equation (4.210) for point (?,?) is 10.45 \u00b0C. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n206 \n \n\n  \n\n \n \n\n \nFigure 80 - P-T diagram for thermodynamic analysis of the LHP described in \n\nTable 20 (case B). \n \nThe thermodynamic analysis of this specific point shows that this \n\nwick geometry can operate for a power load 70 W without formation of \nbubbles inside, according to the criteria calculated by equation (4.210). \nOn the other hand, Maydanik et al. (2011b) and Faghri (1995) explain \nthat LHP\u2019s may continue to operate if the bubbles leave the wick \nstructure through the liquid phase. Using the temperature and pressure \nfield is possible to determine if a region inside of the wick structure \npresent the formation of bubbles. The blockage of vapor can reduce the \nworking fluid transversal flow area, making the device to achieve the \ncapillary limit.  \n \n5.5 Limit and operating temperature \n \n\nOne should remember that the 2D-model (see chapter 4) considered \nthat all heat transfer is through the wick structure. However, the high \nthermal conductivity of the evaporator case and the strong \nunidimensional heat transfer behavior observed in the wick geometry \nallows the application of a 1D model, keeping an acceptable accuracy. \nThe heat leak is the result of two heat transfer paths: the case material \nand the wick plug. Figure 81 shows the heat loss through the case and \nthrough the wick plug. One can see that the heat transfer through the \ncase is larger than the power transferred by the wick plug. The \n\n\n\n207 \n \n\n \n\npercentage difference between these parcels decreases as the power \ninput increases. The maximum heat leakage is equivalent to 3.1 % of the \npower applied. However, the 2D-model temperature fields shows that \nthe temperature difference between the maximum and vapor \ntemperatures is below the critical difference of temperature necessary \nfor the onset of bubbles inside the wick structure, according with the \ncriteria proposed by Reay and Kew (2006). \n\n \n\nFigure 81 - Heat leaks through the case and through the wick plug (case B). \n \n The pressure drop is other important factor that determines the \noperation of a LHP. The maximum heat associated to the capillary \ncapacity is called the capillary limit, as mentioned in chapter 2. This \nsection analyzes the pressure drop in the wick structure. In Figure 82, \ntheoretical values of pressure drop are presented as a function of the \npower load. The total pressure drop was calculated for each load power, \nconsidering the properties of distillate water at 60 \u00b0C. In this figure, the \ncapillary limit is achieved at 120 W. \n\nIn Figure 83, the total pressure drop in the wick structure is \npresented by three pressure drop portions. A first portion produced by \nthe solid cylinder, identified in the 2D pressure model as subdomain 4-5. \nThe second portion is represented by the number 6, and the third portion \nis due to the sum of all pressure drops through the liquid and vapor lines \nand condenser. From Figure 83 it can be seen that the higher pressure \n\n\n\n208 \n \n\n  \n\ndrop is due to the subdomain 6, which represents 47 % of the total \npressure drop for LHP studied. On the other hand, the pressure drop due \nto the plug and flow through the loop (condenser, liquid and vapor lines) \nare 16 and 37 % of the total pressure drop, respectively. \n\n \n\nFigure 82 - Thermal behavior of the LHPs described in Table 20, operating with \nwater (case B). \n\n \n\nFigure 83 - Total pressure drop LHP described in Table 20, operating with \nwater (case B). \n\n\n\n209 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 84 shows a plot of the experimental vapor temperature \ncorresponding to thermocouple T1 (see Figure 69) and the theoretical \nprediction obtained from 1D-model applied to the LHP studied (case B), \nagainst electrical power input. From this figure, one can see that the \nmaximum temperature is 66.37 \u00b0C for an applied power of 15 W. After \nthat, the temperature of vapor decreases gradually until a minimum \nvalue of 57 \u00b0C, for 70 W. According to Ku (1999), this behavior is \ncalled as operation under a variable conductance mode. In this power \nrange, the temperature of the heat source remains constant, which is due \nto the returning liquid from condenser being subcooled enough to \ncompensate the heat leak transferred form evaporation zone. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 84 - Comparison between theoretical and experimental values of the \nLHP evaporator temperature (case B). \n\n  \nFor heat transfer, larger than 80 W, the vapor temperature increases. \n\nHowever, the loop heat pipe continues operating. From this power load, \nthe 1D mathematical model does not agree with the experimental data as \nwell as for smaller heat loads. The smaller difference between the \ntheoretical values and experimental data is 0.5 % for transfer rates less \nthan 80 W, while the largest difference is of 6.63 % for heat transfer \nrates larger than 80 W. the LHP then operates in the constant \nconductance mode. From this power load, the compensation chamber \n\n\n\n210 \n \n\n  \n\nachieves its minimum temperature and the condenser is fully solicited \nby power applied. For this power, the temperature increases linearly \nwith the heat load. The vapor temperature obtained using the 1D-model \nrequires the inlet condensate temperature, which was taken from the \nexperimental measurements of the compensation chamber, i.e., \nthermocouple T10 (see Figure 69). The condenser outlet temperature \nvalue predicted from the model proposed does not show variations with \nthe increase of the heat input, as the inlet temperature was always 20 \u00b0C. \nTherefore, the experimental temperature outlet of condenser increased \nuntil the temperature of 25 \u00b0C, register by thermocouple 7 (see Figure \n72). The heat leak to the liquid line can be explicated by the increase of \nthe temperature of the liquid inlet to the compensation chamber \n(thermocouple 11, see Figure 72) that is the temperature resultant of the \nheat transferred by the case and wick structure evaporator. As a result, \nthe 1D model overestimated the real heat transfer capacity of the \ncondenser.  \n\n \n5.6 Condenser validation model \n \n\nIn of chapter 4, a model to predict the temperature distribution of the \ncondenser based on the analogy of electrical circuit was presented. The \ncondenser was divided into two sections, the first section with length L2? \n\nwhere happens the phase change and the section with length L1? where is \ntransferred the sensible heat. The thermal model of the first section is \nused to determine the condenser length necessary to reject the heat in \nthe phase change. The mathematical model of the second section allows \nto calculate the fluid temperature at the outlet of the condenser and to \ndetermine the heat sensible transferred. In the Figure 85, the temperature \ndistribution for the condenser for each power load is presented. One can \nsee that the length L2? where temperature is constant corresponds to \nphase change of the fluid working. In the Figure 85, the minimal and \nmaximum length L2? were 6.67 mm and 53.8 mm for a load power of 15 \nand 100 W, respectively. These values represent the 2.64 % and 21.3 % \nof the length of the condenser. These results can be explained because \nthe high heat transfer coefficient associated to phase change. In the \nFigure 85 again, one can see also that for a power load of 50 W at 150 \nmm of length of the condenser, the temperature of the sink was \nachieved. For this power level, about of 40 % of total length becomes \nuseless. Therefore, the condenser designing can be improved, reducing \nits length. \n\n \n\n\n\n211 \n \n\n \n\nIn Figure 86, the experimental data of temperature corresponding to \nthermocouples 3, 4, 5 and 6 (see Figure 69) and the predicted \ntemperatures by condenser model are plotted. The highest difference \nbetween the results and theoretical values was 25 % and the smallest \nwas 3 %. The experimental temperature is higher than the predicted \nvalue by model and this difference increases after that the applied power \nload is higher than 50 W, but in general, one can see that the theoretical \nvalues accomplishes the behavior of the temperatures. This difference \nbetween the temperatures may be reduced using the best approximation \nto welding resistance, where the heat flux found a constriction. Also, the \nthermal conductivity of welding can be modified by impurities or \ntrapped gas. \n\n \nFigure 85 - Temperature distribution of the condenser against power \n\nsupplied. \n \nFigure 87 presents the thermal resistance of the studied LHP (case B) \n\nevaluated for each power applied. This thermal resistance was evaluated \ntaking into consideration of the temperature difference between \nthermocouples 1 and the average temperature between thermocouples 3, \n4, 5, 6, and 7 localized in the condenser. The curve shows that the \nthermal resistance decreases as the transferred heat power increases. The \nhighest thermal resistance of 4 \u00b0C/W represents a non-operating \n\n\n\n212 \n \n\n  \n\ncondition. On the other hand, the lowest thermal resistance observed \nwas 0.21 \u00b0C/W. The highest difference between the experimental data \nand values predicted by the mathematical model was 0.09 \u00b0C/W that it is \nequivalent to 33 %. This thermal resistance value corresponds to power \nload of 70 W. For power higher than 50 W, the difference between the \nresults and theoretical data increases. The lowest difference was of 2 %. \n\n \nFigure 86 - Comparison between the experimental and condenser model \n\ntemperatures. \n\n \n\nFigure 87 - LHP measured thermal resistance as a function of the power input. \n\n\n\n213 \n \n\n \n\n5.7 Working fluid inventory \n \nTo determine the better working fluid filling ratio, case B of Table \n\n20 was tested with several different working fluid volumes: 2.4 ml, 2.5 \nml, 2.6 ml, 2.7 ml and 2.8 ml. The amount of working fluid inserted in \nthe LHP is controlled using a graduated pipette with 0.05 ml of scale. \nAlso, the LHP was tested for different applied heat power loads. \n\nTable 23 presents the volumes calculated for each section of LHP \nfabricated (see Figure 63). These values are used in Equations (2.2) and \n(2.3) to calculate the filling ratio and the compensation chamber size \n(KU, 1999). The increase of temperature of LHP in the startup can be \ndue to decrease of volume of compensation chamber. \n\n \nTable 23.

In Figure 88, \none can see that the startup was reached after the application of 30 W, \nreaching a temperature of 65 \u00b0C, as indicated by thermocouple T1 and \nT2. The comparison of the performance for three filling volumes show \nthat, for an increase of 8.3 % in the working fluid, it is observed an \nincrease in the operation temperature by 15.4 %.  \n\nThe maximum startup temperature was 77 \u00b0C for the LHP operating \nwith a working fluid inventory of 2.8 ml. The experimental results of the \nFigure 88, Figure 89 and Figure 90 show an increase in the evaporator \ntemperature when fluid inventory is increased. About 5 \u00b0C was \naugmented the evaporator temperature during the startup, for 0.2 ml that \nequivalent to 8.3 % of increase in the fluid inventory. \n\n \n\n\n\n214 \n \n\n  \n\n \nFigure 88 - Temperatures as a function of time for the LHPs described in Table \n\n20, operating with 2.4 ml of water. \n \n\n \nFigure 89 - Temperatures as a function of time for the LHPs described in Table \n\n20, operating with 2.6 ml of water \n \n\n\n\n215 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 90 - Thermal behavior of the LHPs described in Table 20, operating with \n2.8 ml of water  \n\n \nFigure 91 shows the inventory working fluid volume (in y-axis) \n\nagainst the experimental parameters ? (fraction of the compensation \nchamber occupied by vapor) used as input parameters in the equations \n2.2 (according to Ku, (1999)) for the determination of the mass of \nworking fluid. These relations should be evaluated in two operation \nconditions: hot and cool condition. In Figure 91, the inventory working \nfluid is evaluated for 60 \u00b0C, for hot operation conditions. In the Figure \n91 again, the inventory volume of working fluid that present the lowest \nvapor temperature is also plotted. For this inventory volume, where the \nLHP presented the best behavior, corresponds to a value of the \nexperimental coefficient ? = 0.8 for the hot condition (see equation \n(2.2)). On the other hand, this inventory of working fluid is also \nequivalent to 30% above of the LHP occupied by liquid volume, i.e. \nvolume of porous wick structure plus liquid line. According to Paiva \n(2011) and Peterson (1994b), for HP, the fluid work inventory is \napproximately 10 to 20 % larger than the volume of HP that should be \noccupied by liquid.  \n\n \n\n\n\n216 \n \n\n  \n\n \nFigure 91 - Inventory working fluid model and experimental data. \n\n \n5.8 Conclusions \n \n An equation to determine a design criterion for the evaporation zone \ngeometry was proposed and evaluate experimentally. LHP\u2019s were tested \nusing methanol and water as working fluids and different geometries \nsatisfy and unperformed critical criteria. Using the 2D-model, an \nanalysis of the of thermal response to variations of the geometry \nparameters ? and ?, regarding the temperature distribution and the heat \nleak inside the wick structure for the evaporator of the LHP was \ndevelopment. As result of this analysis, one can see that the proposed \ngeometry presents low heat leakage and that the temperature gradient is \nhigh in the radial direction of the evaporation zone. Therefore, the wick \ngeometry according to the case of study was modeled using a 1D \napproach. The experimental operation of the LHP was compared to the \npredicted temperature by the proposed 1D model showed good \nagreement. An experimental test to determine the inventory of working \nfluid was developed and the experimental parameter was determined \nand compared with other ones proposed in the literature. \n \n \n  \n\n\n\n217 \n \n\n \n\n6 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE \nWORK \n\n \nIn this work, several models for the prediction of the temperature and \n\npressure distribution of the wick structure porous media, for a \ncylindrical shape LHP evaporator, was developed. The wick structure \nevaporator study in this thesis is composed by an active zone of \nevaporation, i.e. a hollow cylinder where heat from the heat source is \ntransferred to surface of evaporation (meniscus) and another solid \ncylinder that separate the compensation chamber for evaporation zone. \n\nFor the thermal model, two approaches were applied for \ndevelopment of the mathematical model: two-dimensional (2D) and one \ndimensional (1D), while the pressure model only was approach for two-\ndimensional (2D). The thermal and pressure 2D model coupled allows \nthe determination of the geometry parameters that guarantees the correct \nperformance of the evaporator, i.e., no vapor bubble formation within \nthe porous media. Therefore, the 2D model is a useful tool for the design \nof the evaporator wick structure of LHP, able to provide a safe operation \nmode. However, the thermal 2D model does not take into account the \nheat loss from the evaporator wall, but only through the wick plug. \nTherefore, based on the 2D results which shows a very close to a one \ndimensional behavior, a 1D model was developed. Although very \nsimple, this model, which makes use of the analogy between thermal \nand electrical circuit, allows for accounting the heat transfer losses from \nthe evaporator to the compensation chamber, and so, to predict the \nactual thermal behavior of the evaporator. The analogy between thermal \nand electrical circuit was also used to determine the temperature \ndistribution along the LHP condenser. Pressure drop models to single \nand two phase fluid were also used in liquid and vapor lines and \ncondenser. \n\nThe temperature and pressure fields show that the interface between \nthe solid and hollow cylinder is the critical region to both heat and mass \ntransfer. However, when the heat load is increased, temperatures higher \nthan the critical ones in these regions can be reached forming vapor and \nreducing the transversal area heat transfer and increasing the pressure \ndrop inside of wick structure evaporator. The procedure to evaluate the \nformation of bubble inside of wick structure was shown, the temperature \nand pressure were evaluated for a point, and it was compared with one \nboiling criteria to determine the formation of bobbles inside of wick \nstructure. \n\n\n\n218 \n \n\n  \n\nAnother theoretical expression for the critical parameter, which \nrelates the thermodynamic properties of the working fluid with the \nthermophysical properties of the porous media, is proposed for the \ndetermination of the wick thickness of the LHP evaporator. LHP \nevaporator were designed and fabricated to evaluate the theoretical \ncriterion. The LHP evaporator project to operate with methanol as \nworking fluid attended the criteria ratio ?/l operating normally. The \nsame LHP was tested with distillated water as working fluid without \nattend the critical criterion do not work. However, a second design of \nwick structure evaporator project to operate with water allowed to show \nthat the equation proposed can be used as tool for design of wick LHP \nevaporator.  \n\nTo design a wick sintered porous media, with desirable parameters \n(porosity, permeability, effective porous radio and effective thermal \nconductivity), models, where the input parameter is the mean particle \ndiameter, were proposed. The sintering process was described using \nliterature models. Experimental apparatus was developed to measure the \nthermophysical properties and the obtained data were compared with \ntheoretical values, showing a good comparison.  \n\nA statistical analysis to determine the main effect of the geometrical \nparameters and effective thermal conductivity on the thermal response \nof a wick structure geometry proposed in this thesis was made. Two \ntypes of powders were selected to produce four different porous \nmaterials with different designs, resulting from the combination of the \nratios between the parameters: ?/l and ?/l. Where ? is the thickness of \nthe wick structure in the active zone of evaporation, ? is the length of \nbottom wick structure that separates the compensation chamber of \nevaporation zone and l is the length of the active zone of evaporation. \nANOVA method was applied and, for a significance level of 95 %, the \nanalyses showed that the parameters: effective thermal conductivity and \nratio ?/l, in the range ?/l crit &lt;?/l &lt;1.2 ?/l, have significant effects over \nthe thermal response (temperature and heat leakage) of the evaporator \nwick.  \n\nExperimental tests with a LHP operating with different fluid \ninventory showed that best mass fluid inventory is related with others \nproposed in literature for HP. The experimental factor used to determine \nthe inventory fluid base and the compensation chamber dimensions was \nalso determined. \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n219 \n \n\n \n\nFuture Works \n \n\nFrom the analyses presented in this thesis, the following future \nworks are proposed: \n\n \n\u2022 To analyze the thermal and pressure criteria based on the \n\npowder diameter for the onset of vapor formation at the \ninterface of coupling of the domains 2 and 3. The literature \ncriteria to evaluate the bubble formation in sintered porous \nmedia are correlations that use parameters with a wide \nrange. \n\n \n\u2022 To determine the optimal geometry parameters based on the \n\n2D and 1D models proposed in this work. The entropy \ngeneration approach can be used as the objective function in \nan optimization process. The present study provides the \ntemperature and pressure drop to determine the optimal \ngeometry. \n\n \n\u2022 To develop a 2D model for the heat and mass transfer in the \n\ntransient regime.

MEASUREMENT UNCERTAINTIES \n \n\nThe measurement result is composed by a base result and an \nuncertainty. The  measurement uncertainties were determined according \nto INMETRO (2012). The uncertainties are classified as standard \nuncertainties type A and standard uncertainties type B. The standard \nuncertainties of type A are the uncertainties calculated from a group of \nobservations or replications of the measurements. The standard \nuncertainties of type B are not obtained from observations replicated. \nThey are based on the available information about the variables \nmeasured such as, previous measurements, the manufacturer's \nspecifications or data supplied in calibration certificates. In this work, \nfor all variables measured, standard uncertainty type B was considered, \nusing the information available from the equipment manuals. \n\nThe standard uncertainty type B of a variable x, uB(x), is estimated \nconsidering the equipment measurement chain. For its calculation, all \nsources of uncertainty ui(x) involved in the measurement chain \n(repeatability, equipment resolution, acquisition system, etc.) were \ncombined as shown in Equation (A.1).  \n\nx3C ??? ? xPC??? ? xCC??? ? ? ? x?C ??? (A.1) \nThe equation above was used for directly measured variables, such \n\nas the temperature. When the variables were indirectly measured from \nother parameters, such as heat flux, the combined standard uncertainty \nwas obtained through the following equation: \n\nx\nC??? ? \u00a8 &lt;|?|?? @\nCF\n\n? \u00aaP xC??? ? (A.2)  \nwhere f represents the variable under interest, defined as a function of \nthe variables xi and u(xi) are the standard uncertainties of each variable \nxi. \n\nThe combined uncertainty of each variable must be multiplied by a \ncoverage factor kp (corresponding to t-Student coefficient) in order to \nobtain the expanded uncertainty U. The expanded uncertainty is the \ninterval where, for a defined probability, one expects to find the aleatory \nerror component of the measurement process. The coverage factor kp is \nan expansion interval of the combined uncertainty, corresponding with \nthe level of probability of the t-Student distribution. \n\n\n\n228 \n \n\n  \n\nIn this thesis, a confidence interval of 95.45 % was used for the \ncalculation of the expanded uncertainty, obtained from the following \nequation: \u00fe??? ? 2? x\n ??? (A.3) \n\nThe coverage factor kp depends on the number of degrees freedom \nresultant from the combined standard uncertainty. In this work, the \nstandard uncertainty type B of the different variables was considered \nwith infinity degrees freedom. Therefore, for a t-Student distribution \nwith confidence interval of 95.45 % and infinity degrees freedom, the \ncoverage factor is kp = 2. This value was considered for the calculation \nof the expanded uncertainty of all the variables tested. \n\nThe specified information about the uncertainty calculated for each \nvariable tested is presented in the following sections.  \n \nA.1. Uncertainty of the temperature  \n \n\nThe temperature measurement chain is composed by a Type T \n(copper-constantan) thermocouple with 0.07 mm diameter connected to \na data acquisition system and an extension wire that sends the signal \nfrom the data acquisition system to a computer. The temperature \nreadings are processed by LabVIEW 8.6. The summary of the \nuncertainties involved in the measurement of the temperature is \npresented in the Table A.1 \n\n \nTable A3.

According to \nthe manufacturer, the resolution is 0.01 mm.

The uncertainty of the pressure measurements was \ncalculated from the resolution of the display: 100 Pa. A pressure sensor \n(Omega PX409-015DWUV) was used to measure the gas pressure for \nthe measurements of effective porous radius. The uncertainty calculated \nfor this equipment was 210 Pa. \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n231 \n \n\n \n\nA.5 Uncertainty of the effective thermal conductivity  \n \n\nThe effective thermal conductivity is calculated from other \nphysical quantities, such as temperature, heat flux, cross area and length. \nTherefore, in order to determine the combined standard uncertainly of \nthe effective thermal conductivity, the following equation was \nemployed: \n\n \n\nS?\u00b7 ? ?=|2[|\u00e3 ?C ?TU?C ? =|2[|) ?C ?TV?C\n? =|2[|? ?C ?TW?C ? =|2[|\\ ?C ?Tb?C?\n\nP C \n \n\n(A.7) \n\n \nwhere Keff is the effective thermal conductivity, TU,TV, TW X TY are the \nstandard uncertainty for each quantity measured, i.e., heat flux, \ntemperature, length and cross area of the sample, respectively. The \nfollowing equation was presented by Florez et al. (2013) to determine \nthe effective thermal conductivity from the comparative method.  \n\n2[55 ? ??)\\&lt;\u00e3? ? ?) = 1SP ? 1SC ?@ (A.8) \nThe term within parentheses in the equation above is assumed as \n\nconstant and negligible for the uncertainty. The combined uncertainty \nfor the temperature and the length are shown in the Tables A.1 and A.2, \nrespectively. The heat flux uncertainty was calculated from difference \nbetween the maximum heat flux measurement in the heat flux meter and \nthe average heat flux.  \n\nThe cross area of the sample is calculated from the following \nequation: \n\n\\E ?  \nG (A.9) \nwhere W and H are the dimensions used to calculate the cross area of the \nsample. By calculating the partial derivate of Equation (A.9) and \nsubstituting into Equation (A.2), one obtains the following equation to \ndetermine the combined uncertainty of the cross area. \n |\\E ?  f?G?C?TZ?C ?  ?\n?C?TZ?CjP/C \n\n(A.10) \n\n\n\n232 \n \n\n  \n\nIn relation to the measurement made by the thermal conductivity \nanalyzer C-thermal Tci, the manufacturer reports 5 % of the \nexperimental value as uncertainty of the effective thermal conductivity.  \n\n \nA.6 Uncertainty of the thermal resistance of power input \n \n\nThis section presents the procedure to calculate the uncertainty of \nthe thermal resistance of the loop heat pipes tested and the uncertainty \nof the power input.  \n\nFrom the following equation: \n SE ?  )?[?? ?  )?\n\n?%$[  (A.11) \n\n \n\nTherefore, the combined standard uncertainty of the thermal \nresistance is calculated as: \n\n \n\nS[\\ ? ?= |SE)?[?? ?\nC ?T'?\u00b7*] ?C ? = |SE|)?\n\n?% ?\n\nC ?T'?,^\u00c3_ ?C\n? =|SE|$[ ?\n\nC ?T&amp;\u00b7 ?C?P/C \n(A.12) \n\n \n\nwhere Rt is the thermal resistance of LHP, Pe is the power input,  )?[?? e )?\n\n?%  are the average temperature in the evaporator and condenser, \nrespectively, T'?\u00b7*] , T'?,^\u00c3_  e T&amp;\u00b7  are the combined uncertainties, \nassociated to the average temperatures and the power supplied by the \ncartridge heaters. \n\nThe power input is defined as: \n $[ ? ??
