In this sense, alert systems are one of  \nthe most effective measures (ALFIERI et al., 2012).\n\nEarly warning systems have main purpose of  predict \nthe future possibility of  a river floods occurrence and its related \ncharacteristics at vulnerable sites with time advance and acceptable \naccuracy, to issue warnings to those responsible for civil defense, the \nwater consumers, the local population and the hydraulic structures \noperators in the region (FAN et al., 2016; ALFIERI et al., 2012; \nMOORE; BELL; JONES, 2005; TACHINI, 2003). The main \ncomponent of  any early warning system is a system for flood \nforecasts.\n\nFlood forecasting systems are especially important for basins \nhaving fast runoff, a characteristic behavior of  several brazilian river \nbasins, mainly those located in the South region. One of  them is \nthe upper Uruguay river basin (see Figure 1), located in the Serra \nGeral geological formation, a region dominated by basalts soils \nand rocks (NARDY et al., 2002). The basin geological framework \nprovides a very fast response to rainfall events that, consequently, \nmay produce unexpected floods. Summed to this, the absence of  \nprecipitation seasonality allows the occurrence of  sudden river \ndischarge increases at any time of  the year.\n\nIn addition, researches related to forecasting systems \nevaluation are important to show potential benefits of  tested \ntechniques and products and to allow a better understanding of  \nthe modelled systems. Based on the forecasts, developments can \nbe planned to improve accuracy (ALFIERI et al., 2014). Also, in \nthe context of  operational use, investigations help to highlight the \ncurrent system problems, whose must be considered when forecast \nresults are to be used for decision making (PAGANO et al., 2014).\n\nSome examples of  streamflow forecasting studies focusing \non its results verifications can be found in recent literature: Bergh \nand Roulin (2010), Thiemig et al. (2010), Schellekens et al. (2011), \nBao et al. (2011), Addor et al. (2011), Boucher et al. (2011), Bourdin \nand Stull (2013), Alfieri et al. (2014), Pagano (2014), Fan et al. \n(2014, 2015a,c), Siqueira et al. (2016a) and Casagrande et al. (2017).\n\nFrom these cited references, the work of  Bergh and Roulin \n(2010) presented the forecasting systems from the Belgium Royal \nMeteorological Institute (RMI) for rivers Meuse and Scheldt \n(in Europe, with areas ranging from 590 to 2440 km2) with 9 days \nof  forecast horizon. Results of  the model were evaluated for a \nhindcasting experiment between February 2006 and March 2009. \nThe authors concluded that the forecasts perform well until the \nmost distant forecast horizon and that it has economic value added \nthrough a specific evaluation metric.\n\nThiemig et al. (2010) evaluated the feasibility of  forecasts \nwith up to 10 days horizon in two locations in East Africa, one \nsite in the Juba River Basin (166,000 km2) and one in the Shabelle \nRiver Basin (207,000km2). Basically, the experiment consisted \nof  reproducing the EFAS system technology (THIELEN et al., \n2009) for the African basins. Results showed that the forecasting \nsystem could predict about 85% of  the flood cases evaluated \nwith good accuracy.\n\nThe work of  Addor et al. (2011) shows an assessment of  a \nforecasting system for the Sihl river basin (336 km2), which flows \nthrough Zurich (Switzerland) and has been operational since 2008. \nData from the COSMO-7 and the COSMOLEPS meteorological \nmodels are considered as a forcing in the hydrological model. \nThe results of  several metrics used by the authors indicated benefits \nin the use of  predictions from COSMOLEPS. The authors also \nfound that the two major rainfall events in the basin during the \nevaluation period were generally underestimated.\n\nIn the paper of  Schellekens et al. (2011), the authors \nevaluated the performance of  the regional forecasting system \ncalled MOGREPS (Met Office Global and Regional Ensemble \nPrediction System) for flood prediction in the Thames River \nbasin in the United Kingdom. The MOGREPS version used \nhas a resolution of  24 km and a forecast horizon of  three days. \n\nFigure 1. Location of  the upper Uruguay river in Brazil. Highlight is given to the main basins of  interest.\n\n\n\nRBRH, Porto Alegre, v. 22, e37, 2017\n\nFan et al.\n\nThe hydrological model used was the TCM (Thames Catchment \nModel), with a procedure of  output corrections. As conclusions, \nthe authors cite that MOGREPS predictions resulted in good \nflood forecasts across the Thames region. The frequency of  false \nalarms in the evaluated period was low, and the smaller events \n(below alert limits) were also well predicted.\n\nIn the study by Bourdin and Stull (2013) the authors \npresent a verification of  forecasts of  inflows to a hydroelectric \nplant reservoir in the Cheakamus river basin (721 km2) in Canada. \nThe forecasting system used multiple meteorological models connected \nto multiple hydrological models through different downscaling \nschemes. The major goal of  such a complex forecasting system \nwas to sample all possible uncertainties in the process, and include \nthem in the results. The authors concluded that the inclusion of  \nall uncertainties increased the resolution and the capacity of  event \ndiscrimination of  the system, and that the removal of  bias allowed \nto use the maximum potential of  the system.\n\nAlfieri et al. (2014) presented a complete evaluation of  \nthe flow forecasts from the EFAS (European Flood Awareness \nSystem) to various locations in Europe. According to the authors, \nthe performance metrics showed that the forecasts have dexterity for \nmedium and small basins for up to ten days in advance. For smaller \nand mountainous basins, the results are still not very suitable.\n\nPagano (2014) presents an evaluation of  the historical \nrecord of  flood forecasts runned in an operational way by the \nRegional Flood Management and Mitigation Center (RFMMC) of  \nthe Mekong River Commission (Southeast Asia). The RFMMC \nissues daily deterministic forecasts of  river height with 1 to 5 days \nin advance throughout the wet season (June-October) for \n22 locations of  interest. Results evaluated by skill scores shows a \ngood performance of  the forecasts, mainly in regions presenting \na strong seasonal cycle and a narrow natural range of  variability. \nOn the other hand, a moderate probability of  detection of  48% \nand 31% at 1 and 5 days ahead, respectively, and false alarm rate \nof  13% and 74% at 1 and 5 days ahead, respectively were observed \nin the forecasts results evaluated from a categorical \u201ccrossing \nabove/not-crossing above flood level\u201d perspective.\n\nMore recently, the study from Siqueira et al. (2016a) aimed to \nassess both the quality of  ensemble flood forecasts on Taquari-Antas \n(RS, Brazil) basin and its potential to provide additional information \nto a local Flood Alert System. On a single event evaluation, the peak \ndischarge was reasonable well predicted by at least one ensemble \nmember, in nearly all forecasts, with a good prediction of  the \nflood timing for the considered lead times. An overall tendency of  \nunderestimation was also identified, since most of  the observed \nvalues was between the higher ranks of  the ensemble. Results \nsuggest that there is a benefit in having hydrological ensemble \nforecasts, which can be used as a complementary information to \na local Flood Alert System supporting pre-alert issues and Civil \nDefense internal planning actions.\n\nIn general, all these studies provide useful insights of  \nthe forecasting systems performances. They present assessment \nstudies of  pre-operational or operational forecasting systems and \ncontribute to the current knowledge about methodologies and \nhydro-meteorological forecasting performances at multiple locations.\n\nConsidering the exposed above, the present study describes \nthe development and results evaluation of  an experimental \n\noperational discharge forecasting system of  the upper Uruguay \nRiver basin, which is based on a large-scale distributed hydrological \nmodel. The hydrological model is used to estimates river discharges \nforced by observed and predicted rainfall as inputs. The system may \nprovide experimental deterministic forecasts at several locations \nof  the basin. The present study case could be operationally \nuseful because the information generated could be considered, \nfor example, for better operations of  two hydropower plants \n(HPP) reservoirs: Campos Novos HPP; and Barra Grande HPP \n(Figure 1). Although the basins are located close to each other, \nthe complexity of  inflow forecasting generation to the dams \ndiffers due to regional hydrological features, which interacts with \nmeteorological uncertainties.\n\nThe system was operated in operational mode once a day \nfrom July 2013 to July 2016. The following sessions contain a \ndescription of  the main features of  the developed system and the \nresults of  forecasts of  reservoirs inflows for the largest floods \noccurred during the operational period.\n\nAs the referenced commented studies, this work also \naimed to contribute to the current knowledge about forecasting \nperformances, especially related to understanding the operational \nfeasibility of  the techniques applied and the data used for basins \nsuch as those studied. In addition, it is done a comparative \nanalysis of  how sub-basins close in space may present different \nperformances. The hypothesis of  the study is that the developed \nsystem is suitable for forecasts in the region, which is evaluated \nby an analysis of  the forecasts performed. In the presented case, \naccurate forecasts can be translated into improved decisions \nrelating to energy generation, dam safety and flood control through \nhydraulic structures operation.\n\nFORECASTING SYSTEM OVERVIEW\n\nRainfall and discharge data from telemetric gauges spatially \ndistributed within the basin are used by the forecast system of  \nthe upper Uruguay river basin. The system also uses Quantitative \nPrecipitation Forecasts (QPF) from meteorological models as \ninput data to provide streamflow forecasts ten days in advance at \nmultiple locations in the basin. If  necessary upstream boundary \nconditions can also be used, as the programmed outflow of  Dams. \nFigure 2 presents an illustrative workflow of  the forecasting \nsystem. All data is processed in the MGB-IPH hydrological model \n(COLLISCHONN et al., 2007; FAN; COLLISCHONN, 2014; \nPONTES et al., 2015, 2017) described in the following section.\n\nUsing the system requires rainfall data recorded by a \ntelemetric gauges network for a recent past. All rainfall information \nis interpolated by the inverse distance weighted method to assess \nthe spatial patterns of  rainfall across the basin before be used in the \nhydrological model as input information. Also, at defined locations \nwithin the basin, the streamflow time series for the recent past \nare derived using the estimative of  water levels from telemetric \ngauges and its respective rating curves to generate streamflow time \nseries for the recent past. These series area used through a data \nassimilation scheme implemented in the MGB-IPH (described later \nin this paper). Table 1 presents the name and location (geographic \ncoordinates) of  all telemetric gauges used in the presented system, \nthey are used to measure both rainfall and water levels.\n\n\n\nRBRH, Porto Alegre, v. 22, e37, 2017\n\nEvaluation of  upper Uruguay river basin (Brazil) operational flood forecasts\n\nThe streamflow forecasting process also needs data about \nthe future rainfall, over the forecasted lead times. For research \npurposes, in the present study, it was used Quantitative Precipitation \nForecasts (QPF) from the Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) \nmodel Eta-15km. The Eta-15km, which has 15km of  grid \nresolution, provides future rainfall predictions over all South \nAmerica. The Eta model data have a forecast horizon of  7 days \nand are available twice a day by the webpage of  the Brazilian \nmeteorological center CPTEC (\u201cCentro de Previs\u00e3o de Tempo e Estudos \nClim\u00e1ticos\u201d, in Portuguese).\n\nThe system results were daily monitored by a research \nteam that included the system developers. The total lead time of  \nthe distributed hydrological forecasts by the system was ten days \n(240 hours). The first 7 days of  the forecasting horizon used the \nCPTEC Eta-15km rainfall forecasts as inputs, and the last 3 days \nconsidered a null precipitation over the watershed area.\n\nMGB-IPH HYDROLOGICAL MODEL \nDESCRIPTION\n\nThe MGB-IPH (Modelo de Grandes Bacias \u2013 Instituto de \nPesquisas Hidr\u00e1ulicas) is a large-scale hydrological model that \ncalculates the hydrological processes into a catchment through \nclimate variables, physiographic data and soil and land type data \n(COLLISCHONN et al., 2007; FAN; COLLISCHONN, 2014; \nPONTES et al., 2015, 2017).\n\nThe MGB-IPH is a distributed hydrological model and \nthe basin is subdivided into minor units (catchments) using \nGeographical Information Systems (GIS) tools in a stage of  \ndata pre-processing (SIQUEIRA et al., 2016b). The model runs \nwith daily or hourly time step, although some internal calculation \nprocesses, such as streamflow routing always uses a smaller time \nsteps. Most of  the MGB-IPH applications have been used a daily \ntime step (FAN; COLLISCHONN, 2014; PONTES et al., 2015). \nIn the present work, we applied the hydrological model for flood \nforecasting with an hourly time-step since 2013.\n\nThe spatial variability of  the relief  is considered using a \nDigital Elevation Model (DEM). The spatial variability of  vegetation, \nland use and soil type within the basin are considered using the \nHydrological Response Classes (HRC) approach. The HRC\u2019s are \nareas of  similar hydrological behavior, defined by the combined \nland use and soil type maps (FAN et al., 2015b). Combining \nthe HRC map with each catchment generates the Hydrological \nResponse Units (HRU), where the vertical hydrological balances \nare processed.\n\nSoil water balance is performed using a method based on \nthe surface runoff  by excess of  soil capacity storage that uses a \nprobabilistic relationship between soil moisture and the fraction \nof  saturated soil area. Evapotranspiration is estimated by the \nPenman-Monteith equation.\n\nTable 1.

Illustrative workflow of  the forecasting system. Green boxes indicate observed (past) data and red boxes indicate modeled/\ninferred (future) data.\n\n\n\nRBRH, Porto Alegre, v. 22, e37, 2017\n\nFan et al.\n\nStreamflow generation in the basin and its propagation to \nthe river network is performed in two steps. First streamflow is \ngenerated inside each catchment and then routed to the stream \nnetwork using three linear reservoirs (representing base flow; \nsubsurface flow and surface flow). The output streamflow of  \nthose reservoirs is summed and routed along the river network \nusing the Muskingum-Cunge flow routing method.\n\nThe MGB-IPH model parameters were first set for the \nUruguay river basin based on the parameters used by Andreolli et al. \n(2006) to simulate the basin, and later were refined in the context \nof  a research and development project (BELTRAME, 2012). \nCalibration performance to the upper Uruguay river basin is \npresented at Table 2. Used performance metrics were: (i) Discharges \nNash Sutcliffe coefficient NS (NASH; SUTCLIFFE, 1970); \n(ii) Discharges Logarithm Nash Sutcliffe coefficient NSlog; and \n(iii) volume error (mean discharge error).\n\nIn general words, calibration was considered good enough \nfor forecasting purposes in the basin. The median values of  NS, \nNSlog and Volume Error performance metrics were 0.6, 0.7 and -2%.\n\nIn the context of  real-time forecasting, the model includes \na method of  data assimilation, when it is said that the model works \nin \u201cupdate mode\u201d or operating \u201con- line\u201d. The data assimilation \nmethod in the MGB-IPH model is conducted through an empirical \nmethod that uses real time observed flow rates to update the \ninitial conditions of  the MGB-IPH model, represented by the \nflow calculated along the drainage network and the volume of  \nwater stored in the catchments reservoirs (MELLER; BRAVO; \nCOLLISCHONN, 2012; FAN; MELLER; COLLISCHONN, 2015).\n\nFor the application in the Uruguay river basin the data \nassimilation method of  the MGB-IPH model was activated and \nused in the system operation.\n\nOPERATIONAL FORECASTING ASSESSMENTS \nAND DISCUSSIONS\n\nThe daily Uruguay forecasting system predictions were \nrecorded since July 2013 until July 2016 for the system evaluation. \nIn the following sections is presented the results obtained until the \nend of  the system operation. All results are inflow assessments.\n\nFirst, is showed a visual assessment of  some of  the past \nfloods forecasted. Second, the system performance is evaluated by \ncomparing forecasts with observed discharges using performance \nmetrics commonly used in hydrological modelling studies: (i) Nash \n\nSutcliffe coefficient NS (NASH; SUTCLIFFE, 1970); (ii) Persistence \nCoefficient (PC); (iii) Mean Absolute Error (MAE); and (iv) Root \nMean Square Error (RMSE).\n\nThe Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (Equation 1) allows a \ncomparison between the results predicted and the mean of  all \nobserved streamflows. The closer its value is to one the better \nare the results of  forecasts. On the other hand, negative values \nindicate that using the averaged observed value as the predicted \nvalue provide a better results.\n\nThe PC shown in Equation 2, allows a comparison between \nforecasted results and a hypothetical model that predicts, for all \ntime intervals over the forecast horizon, the last observed value \n(hence the name \u201cpersistence\u201d). It is also known as \u201ctoday is equal \nto yesterday\u201d model. The forecasts results are better as closer the \nPC value is to one. When PC values are less than zero, using the \nlast observed value performs better than the prediction value.\n\nThe Mean Absolute Error (Equation 3) measures the \naverage absolute difference between the predicted and observed \nvalues. The results of  forecasts are better as closer the MAE \nvalue is to zero. Finally, the Root Mean Square Error (Equation 4) \nmeasures the root mean square difference between the forecasted \nand observated values. Again, the closer its value is to zero, the \nbetter the results of  forecasts. Compared to the MAE, the RMSE \nhelps to understand the distribution of  the errors in the forecast, \nsince it gives greater weight to larger deviations.\n\n( )\n( )\n\nN 2\ni in 1\n\nN 2\ni mn 1\n\nQo Qp\nNS  \n\nQo Qo\n=\n\n=\n\n?\n=\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n  (1)\n\n( )\n( )\n\nN 2\ni in 1\n\nN 2\ni t 0n 1\n\nQo Qp\nPC  \n\nQo Qo\n=\n\n=\n\n?\n=\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n  (2)\n\nN\n\ni i\nn 1\n\n1\nEMA Qp Qo\n\nN =\n= ??

Two days later, the forecast of  15 October \nstill correctly shows a streamflow peak, although the value of  the \npeak was not perfect, the forecast was very persistent on indicating \nthe event occurrence.\n\nThe second event (Figure 4) corresponds to a flow peak \nof  approximately 6000 m3/s occurred at 09 October 2015. \nThe possible occurrence of  a high flow at this day was predicted \ntwo days in advance by the forecast issued in 07 October 2014, \npresenting a flow peak near to that observed value. The flow \npeak was persistently predicted by the system one in advance, at \n08 October 2015.\n\nThe third analyzed event (Figure 5) was another inflow \npeak of  approximately 6000 m3/s occurring at 22 October 2015. \nIn this case, the system alerted for possible elevated inflow events \nfive days in advance (forecast issued at 17 October 2015) to the \noccurrence of  the inflow peak. The event was persistently forecasted \nin the sequence of  forecasts, as an example, at 18 October 2015, \nalthough with some timing lag.\n\nThe cases presented in Figures 3, 4 and 5 shows forecasts \nwith reasonable quality. However, as shown in Figure 6, this pattern \nwas not always observed.\n\nFigure 6 shows a sequence of  two forecasts issued in \nrespectively at 13 and 14 July 2016, both not predicting the flow \npeak of  6800 m3/s at 15 July 2016. At least at both forecasts \nthe attention threshold was identified by the system, minimizing \neventually damages related to the situation to be considered normal.\n\nWe believe that these unsuccessful forecasts were due to \na combination of  facts: (i) the real spatial rainfall over the basin \nwas not well surveyed by the existing rain gauging stations; (ii) the \nNWP model did not shows a precisely prediction of  the amounts \nof  rainfall over the basin for different lead-times; (iii) the Barra \nGrande HPP basin is very sensitive to rainfalls location, and \npossibly the forecasted rainfall was not over the most rainfall \nsensitive region of  the basin, where it truly occurred (spatial bias).\n\nFigure 7 and Figure 8 present forecasts for two cases at \nthe Campos Novos HPP. The first case (Figure 7) is a high flow \nevent with 2500m3/s peak at 02 October 2014, as marked on the \nhydrographs. The first graph (Figure 7a) shows the forecast issued \nin the morning of  29 September 2014, i.e. four days before the \npeak actually occurred. The second graph (Figure 7b) shows the \nforecast issued at 02 October 2014, i.e. one day before the peak \nactually occurred. It can be seen that both forecasts persistently \nissued the occurrence of  the high flow event, with an increasing \nquality of  the recent forecasts for the peak value.\n\nFigure 7. Sequence of  forecasts for a flooding event at 02 October \n2014 for Campos Novos HPP: (a) Forecast issued at 02 October \n2014; and (b) Forecast issued at 01 October 2014.\n\nFigure 8. Sequence of  forecasts for a flooding event at 23 October \n2015 for Campos Novos HPP: (a) Forecast issued at 17 October \n2015; and (b) Forecast issued at 22 October 2015.\n\n\n\nRBRH, Porto Alegre, v. 22, e37, 2017\n\nEvaluation of  upper Uruguay river basin (Brazil) operational flood forecasts\n\nThe second case (Figure 8) is part of  a sequence of  events \nwith a peak inflow of  3600m3/s at 23 October 2015. The first \ngraph (Figure 8a) shows the forecast issued in the morning of  \n17 October 2015, with the correctly indication of  a flood over the \nthreshold six days prior to the event. The second graph shows the \nforecast issued at 22 October 2015, when the inflow was already \nelevated, the flood volume occurrence was well forecasted, but \nwith some overestimation in terms of  peak value and timming.\n\nMetrics assessments\n\nFigure 9 and Figure 10 present an analysis of  the lead time \nperformance of  the hydrological forecasting system, performed \nusing the metrics explained.\n\nRegarding the results presented in Figure 9 (Barra Gande \nHPP), for lead times lower or equal to 160 hours (6,5 days) the \nNS coefficient values were positive, indicating that using model \nresults as the predicted value is better than using the average of  \nthe observed data set until this lead time. The PC results indicate \nan important characteristic of  fast-response river basins, such \nas the upper Uruguay one, that is not very convenient use as \na prediction the last observed values for longer than 10 hours. \nDue to this fact, auto-regressive models usually perform poorly \nin this region. The basin has a very fast response to rainfall, and \n\nFigure 9. Lead time performance analysis of  the hydrological forecasting system for Barra Grande HPP using four different metrics: \nNash Sutcliffe coefficient for flows (NS), Persistence Coefficient (PC), Mean Absolut Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error \n(RMSE).\n\none can have wrong forecasts if  relying only in the last observed \nflow values. This is shown by the positive values of  the PC metric \nafter 10h lead times, as presented in Figure 9. By the point of  \nview of  a rainfall-runoff  forecasting system, this result suports \nthe developed system importance, being considered very positive.\n\nAnalysis of  the Mean Absolute Error shown in Figure 9 \n(Barra Grande HPP) indicates errors lower than 310m3/s. These \nerrors values can be considered low if  compared to the magnitude \nof  flooding\u2019s, that are presented in the visual assessments \n(up to 6000m3/s). For the root mean square error, the interpretation \nof  results in terms of  lead time is similar to MAE. Also, if  we \ncompare the values and behavior of  RMSE with EMA it is possible \nto say that the errors are well distributed among the forecasts and \nlead times, since they have similar curves behaviors, there are no \ngreater discrepancies highlighted by the RMSE.\n\nRegarding the results presented in Figure 10 (Canoas HPP), \nvalues of  the NS coefficient were positive over all lead times. \nThese results showing that the model is always better than using \naverage of  the observed data set, as predicted value. The results \nobtained for the PC also indicate that using the last observed \nvalues as the prediction is not very appropriate from 22h lead \ntimes ahead, in comparison to the forecasting system, since PC \nvalues from this lead time are always above zero.\n\nAnalysis of  the Mean Absolute Error shown in Figure 10 \n(Campos Novos HPP) indicates errors lower than 255m3/s. \n\n\n\nRBRH, Porto Alegre, v. 22, e37, 2017\n\nFan et al.\n\nFigure 10. Lead time performance analysis of  the hydrological forecasting system for Campos Novos HPP using four different \nmetrics: Nash Sutcliffe coefficient for flows (NS), Persistence Coefficient (PC), Mean Absolut Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square \nError (RMSE).\n\nOver, these errors values can be considered low if  compared \nto the magnitude of  flooding\u2019s, that are presented in the visual \nassessments. For example, 255m3/s is less than 10% of  the flood \npeaks assessed previously. Also, this error has a relationship with \nthe uncertainty of  observations that are very noise due to water \nbalance back calculation in the reservoir. For the root mean square \nerror, it is again possible to say that the errors are well distributed \namong the forecasts and lead times, since both metrics have similar \ncurves behavior in comparison to the MAE, there are no greater \ndiscrepancies highlighted by the RMSE.\n\nWhat are the differences and similarities within the \nforecasted systems?\n\nAlthough both studied river basins are located at Uruguay\u2019s \nheadboard, they have different hydrological behavior. Regarding the \ndifferences on relief, the Campos Novos HPP basin has floodplain \nareas at its upper region. Regarding soil profile differences, Barra \nGande HPP basin has less capacity of  water storage. These feature \nmakes the Campos Novos HPP basin runoff  response slower \nthan the Barra Grande HPP one, thus, the flood forecasting in the \nCampos Novos HPP basin usually has better results. This hypothesis \nis confirmed when we analyzed the system performance metrics \nand by the visual assessment as well.\n\nFurthermore, rainfall forecasts play an important role on \nsystem performance. Since CPTEC ETA-15 km is a deterministic \nmodel, several forecasted rainfalls may present unknown uncertainty \nabout an event magnitude and/or occurrence and about the spatial \nposition of  the event within the basin. These errors were shown in \nFigure 5. This is especially important for Barra Grande HPP basin, \nbecause it is more sensible to rainfall spatial and temporal errors.\n\nThis kind of  analysis elucidates that in a hydro-meteorological \nforecasting system the watershed component plays a very important \nrole in the forecasting performance. Even two very near regions, \nsuch as the ones studied here, can have a noticeable different \nperformance.\n\nDespite this, we believe that the forecasting system had \nacceptable performances during the analyzed period (since July \n2013 until July 2016) for both watersheds. The Barra Grande \nHPP and Campos Novos HPP have low MAE compared with the \ninflow floods magnitude and positive NS for longer lead times. \nCP values also shows that a forecasting system that includes \nrainfall forecasts is important due to the basin low dependency \nof  las observed values.\n\nIn comparison to analogous studies presented in the \nliterature we consider that the Barra Gande HPP and the Campos \nNovos HPP forecasts have a performance like other results. \nNon-detection of  thresholds or peak values are also reported \nby Thiemig et al. (2010), Alfieri et al. (2014), Pagano (2014) and \n\n\n\nRBRH, Porto Alegre, v. 22, e37, 2017\n\nEvaluation of  upper Uruguay river basin (Brazil) operational flood forecasts\n\nSiqueira et al. (2016a) . In terms of  metrics, Pagano (2014) found \nfor 1-day ahead NS values of  0.99 and CP for 1-day ahead forecasts \ntypically around 0.4-0.8 and for 5-day ahead forecasts typically \naround 0.1-0.7. Those values are in the same order of  the ones \nfound in the present cases, with elevated NS values at initial lead \ntimes, and CP values greater than zero over almost all lead-times.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThis study showed an assessment of  results of  an \nexperimental operational flow forecasting system of  the Upper \nUruguay River basin, located in southern, Brazil. To evaluate the \nforecasting system were used the predictions produced daily from \nthe model since the beginning of  its operation, in July 2013 until \nthe end, in July 2016.\n\nFor the Barra Grande HPP inflow, visual assessments \nshowed that the predictions have good agreement with observed \ninflows estimative, predicting the possible occurrence of  floods \nwith 2 to 3 days in advance, which is normally confirmed by the \npredictions issued with smaller lead times. This is consistent with \nthe performance lead time analysis, where we showed that the best \nperformance of  the model is for these lead times.\n\nFor the Campos Novos HPP inflow, the results assessments \nshow that the system predictions have an adequate performance \nto almost all lead times. This performance is better than the one \nobserved to the Barra Grande HPP.\n\nWe would like to give highlights to results obtained with \nthe persistence coefficient, which showed the importance of  \nconsidering the rainfall-runoff  transformation in the forecast, \nwhat is related to the rapid response of  the basin to rainfall events. \nAlso, we would like to highlight that even being very spatially \nnear river basins, forecasted inflow performances are noticeable \ndifferent between Campos Novos HPP basin and Barra Grande \nHPP basin. This gives a reference about the importance of  the \nhydrological modelling component of  the hydro-meteorological \nsystem.\n\nRegardless of  the overall good results obtained, the visual \nanalysis also showed that flow forecasts may result in an error. \nBased in the system operation experience, we attribute this mainly \nto the non-perception of  rainfall by the existing gauges in the \nbasin and due to uncertainties at the forecasted rainfall from \nmeteorological model.\n\nTo improve the shorter-term parts of  forecasts, we believe \nthat one solution would be: To increase the rainfall telemetric \ngauges and using rainfall from a radar system. This would also \nneed the recalibration of  the hydrological model to consider the \nnew datasets.\n\nTo enhance the longer-term flow predictions a probabilistic \nforecasts test based on ensembles of  rainfall forecasts could be \ncarried out using different meteorological models, each of  them \nrunning with different initial conditions, such the ones presented by \nMeller, Bravo and Collischonn (2012), Fan et al. (2014), Fan, Ramos \nand Collischonn (2015), or Siqueira et al. (2016a).\n\nAs well, improvements in the hydrological model and \ndata assimilation schema may be useful. These suggestions will \nbe the subject of  attention for forthcoming research related to \nthe hydrological forecasting system of  the Uruguay River basin.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nADDOR, N.; JAUN, S.; FUNDEL, F.; ZAPPA, M.
