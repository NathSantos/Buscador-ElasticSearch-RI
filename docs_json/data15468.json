It is easy to \n\ncontrol, non-polluting at the location of its usage and convenient; it is used in the \n\napplication of heat, light and power. As a secondary energy source, electricity is generated \n\nfrom the conversion of other energy sources, such as coal, natural gas, oil, nuclear power, \n\nhydro power and other renewable sources. This implies that electricity markets and \n\nelectricity prices are fundamentally linked to markets for primary fuels and environmental \n\nconditions such as wind and rain.  \n\nMoreover, from a financial and commodity markets perspective, wholesale electricity\n1\n \n\nprices can generally be viewed as the result of investors having created real options upon \n\nvarious underlying primary fuel commodities such as natural gas, oil or coal. Thus, as \n\nelectricity is often traded on exchanges close to an hour before it is needed, in this short \n\nterm, the variable cost of power generation is essentially just the cost of the fuel. \n\nEconomic theory suggests a relationship should exist between input and output prices. \n\nConsider the simplest case of a single factor of production (input) used to produce a single \n\nproduct, a static supply and demand model suggests that increasing the marginal cost\n2\n of the \n\ninput leads to an increase in the product price. Likewise, an increase in demand leads to an \n\nincrease in quantity demanded for the product, therefore, a higher price. Associated with \n\nthese changes are increasing marginal costs caused by the increased use of the input. \n\nEconomic theory, however, does not state how such relationships will respond in a dynamic \n\nframework. Further complicating the issue are numerous locations using multiple inputs for \n\npower generation with different substitutability and complementary relationships. The \n\ndegree of price transmission from input to output, therefore, may depend on the cost share \n\nof the input factor in question. \n\n                                                      \n\n \n\n1\n Energy supplied by one producer or marketer to another for eventual resale to consumers. \n\n2\n The MIT Dictionary of Modern Economics (Pearce, 1992) defines marginal cost as \u201cthe extra cost of \n\nproducing an extra unit of output\u201d. Paul Samuelson defines marginal cost more cautiously as the \u201ccost of \n\nproducing one extra unit more (or less)\u201d. The \u201cor less\u201d is important. The assumption behind this definition is \n\nthat producing one more unit of output would cost exactly as much as producing one less unit would save. \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n4 \n\nHowever, the current volatile commodities market makes it very difficult to predict the price \n\nbehaviour even more in the case of the power market. That makes it crucial to know what \n\nthe possible external causes might be. \n\nThis study examines the long-run relations and short-run dynamics between electricity \n\nprices and other factors that may impact the Spanish wholesale electricity spot prices. The \n\nfactors under analysis are mainly three fossil fuels (coal, natural gas and crude oil), one \n\nrefined oil product (gasoil) and also the wholesale electricity spot prices formed in Portugal \n\nand France. Providing information on the dynamics of electricity and fuel source prices \n\nallows for a better understanding of price information flow among the markets. \n\nFirst, coal and natural gas serve as important sources of fuel supply in electricity generation \n\nprocess, being basically the marginal technologies that define the wholesale electricity spot \n\nprice formation. According to 2008 data published by the Spanish transmission system \n\noperator\n3\n REE\n\n4\n, about 49% of the electricity in Spain was generated using coal, natural gas \n\nand fuel oil, with natural gas accounting for more than one third of the electricity generation \n\nand coal for around 16%. Thus, changes in coal and natural gas prices can directly affect the \n\ncost of generating electricity and contribute to its price at the retail level. Second, crude oil \n\nprices may also contribute to form electricity prices directly by raising electricity generation \n\ncosts and indirectly through changes in market sentiments. The major long-term natural gas \n\ncontracts that use crude oil as a price reference can be another relevant issue to discuss. \n\nIn the context of MIBEL\n5\n, Portugal and Spain use OMEL\n\n6\n power exchange\n\n7\n platform as \n\nelectricity wholesale market operator. Wholesale electricity spot price formation in OMEL \n\nuses \u201cmarket splitting\u201d procedure to solve cross-border congestion management (one single \n\nIberian price area if there is no congestion in the interconnection between Spain and \n\n                                                      \n\n \n\n3\n Transmission System Operator is a body responsible for operating and maintaining the physical electricity \n\nnetwork. \n4\n Red El\u00e9ctrica de Espa\u00f1a. \n\n5\n An acronym for Mercado Ib\u00e9rico de Electricidade, the joint Spanish-Portuguese electricity market that came \n\ninto effect in July 2007 and allows participants to buy and sell power on either side of the Spain / Portugal \n\nborder to create a pan-Iberian market with more than 28 million business customers. \n6\n Compa\u00f1ia Operadora del Mercado de Electricidad. \n\n7\n Power exchange is an entity set up to provide an efficient, competitive trading arena, open on a non-\n\ndiscriminatory basis to all electricity suppliers, which meets the load of all exchange customers at efficient \n\nprices. \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n5 \n\nPortugal and with distinct price areas if there is congestion in the interconnection between \n\nboth countries). France is also another country connected with Spain that uses the \n\ninterconnection between them for exporting and importing electric energy. In France the \n\nwholesale electricity spot price is determined by the Powernext power exchange which \n\nnowadays belongs to the European Power Exchange Spot (EPEX Spot, a former cooperation \n\nbetween EEX\n8\n and Powernext). Interconnection capacity makes it possible to trade \n\nelectricity between countries. So, the wholesale electricity market price evolution in each \n\ncountry as an impact on the cross-border electricity flows between the two systems and \n\ndictates the transit of the energy flow from one system to another (if the electricity price in \n\nSpain is greater than the electricity price in France, a transit of energy flow between France \n\nand Spain should occur; if the electricity price in Spain is lower than the electricity price in \n\nFrance, a transit of energy between Spain and France should occur). Studying the relations \n\nand dynamics between interconnected systems using as an input the electricity spot price \n\nformed in each electrical system is also relevant because it might also have an impact on the \n\nevolution of the Spanish wholesale electricity spot prices. \n\nThis thesis aims to present a synthesis of econometric models that allow an explanation for \n\nthe relationship between electricity prices and fuel prices. The study is organized as follows:  \n\nChapter 2 begins with energy commodities and their impact on world economy. This \n\nchapter also makes an introduction to each relevant primary energy commodity with \n\nimpacts on power generation fuel cost. A brief overview of the Spanish Electricity Market \n\ncan be found in Chapter 3. This chapter begins with a description about Electricity Markets \n\nand ends with a reference to the Spanish Electricity Market in the context of MIBEL. Since \n\nthe vast majority of economic and financial series show clear evidence of nonstationarity, \n\nthis concept is introduced in Chapter 4 and tests for nonstationarity are presented. It \n\ncontinues with the notion of cointegration from which it is possible to infer market \n\nintegration. Additionally, to validate certain issues about some cointegration properties, a \n\nstudy about exogeneity, proportionality and asymmetry will also be shown. Following the \n\ndata presentation in Chapter 5, Chapter 6 shows the empirical findings to verify the concepts \n\nderived in the theoretical framework described in Chapter 4. Finally, conclusions are \n\npresented in Chapter 7. \n\n                                                      \n\n \n\n8\n European Energy Exchange: Germany's energy exchange, is the leading energy exchange in Central Europe. \n\n\n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n7 \n\n2 ENERGY COMMODITIES: A BRIEF DESCRIPTION \n\nOver the past years, the entire world economy has been affected by a massive increase in \n\nenergy prices. Yet only a few years ago, there was complete confidence that cheap energy \n\nwould last indefinitely.  \n\nEnergy use is crucial for modern society and world energy demand is growing constantly. In \n\nrecent years, public interest in the energy sector has risen sharply with rapidly increasing oil \n\nprices, the liberalization of energy markets, and the first noticeable effects of climate change \n\ncaused by the burning of fossil fuels. Securing a reliable and sustainable energy supply in \n\nlight of declining resources and climate change mitigation will be a key challenge for the \n\n21\nst\n century. \n\nFigure 1 - Historical evolution of fuel prices \n\n \n\nSource: BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2009 (1990 = 100, prices in USD) \n\nUntil the mid-20\nth\n\n century, energy demand was almost exclusively met by domestic energy \n\nsources. Since then, fossil fuels have become traded internationally and for electricity \n\nregional interconnected markets have evolved. Liberalization of energy markets in many \n\nregions of the world has led to new electricity and gas markets and to a significant increase \n\nin trading volumes. \n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\n1\n9\n\n9\n0\n\n1\n9\n\n9\n1\n\n1\n9\n\n9\n2\n\n1\n9\n\n9\n3\n\n1\n9\n\n9\n4\n\n1\n9\n\n9\n5\n\n1\n9\n\n9\n6\n\n1\n9\n\n9\n7\n\n1\n9\n\n9\n8\n\n1\n9\n\n9\n9\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n1\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n2\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n3\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n4\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n5\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n6\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n7\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\nCOAL CIF ARA NWE (API2) EU NATURAL GAS CIF BRENT CRUDE\n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n8 \n\nBesides the energy companies and besides large consumers and emitters, banks and other \n\nspeculative traders participate in these growing markets. In recent years, commodities have \n\nbeen increasingly recognized as an important asset class in fund management which can \n\nimprove a portfolio\u2019s risk profile. Energy and emissions markets are often described as \n\nunstable and erratic. They are characterized by a multitude of complex products, by high \n\nprice volatility, and by fundamental interactions between each other. For example, gas \n\nprices will not develop independently of oil prices in the long run, as these fuels can be used \n\nas substitutes for each other in many applications. Electricity prices depend on electricity \n\ngeneration costs, which are directly impacted by prices for fuels and in the case of \n\nenvironmental restrictions derived from climate change policies the use of fossil fuels \n\ndirectly impact on CO2 emissions pricing trough its more extensive use. \n\n2.1 CRUDE OIL \n\nThe Oil Market is certainly the most prominent among the energy markets. Crude Oil (or \n\npetroleum) is found in reserves spread across particular regions of the earth\u2019s crust, where it \n\ncan be accessed from the surface. Even though petroleum has been known and used for \n\nthousands of years, it became increasingly important during the second half of the 19\nth\n\n \n\ncentury as a primary energy source and as a raw material for chemical products. \n\nToday, crude oil is still the predominant source of energy in the transportation sector and is \n\noften taken as a benchmark for the price of energy in general. In Europe, for example, prices \n\nof natural gas are typically derived from oil prices. Therefore oil prices also have an impact \n\non electricity prices, even though oil plays a minor role as a primary energy source for \n\nelectricity generation. \n\nThe physical crude oil market has to deal with a large variety of different oil qualities \n\n(viscosity, sulphur contents) and with different means of transportation (pipeline, shipping). \n\nAll of these characteristics influence the oil price. Nevertheless, a liquid oil market has been \n\ndeveloped, using few reference oil qualities as benchmarks for pricing an individual oil \n\nquality. The most popular benchmark oils are: \n\n? West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil (WTI): Reference for the US market, Sulphur \n\ncontent: 0.3%; \n\n? Brent Crude Oil: Reference for the North Sea oil market with a similar quality as \n\nWTI. Sulphur content: 0.3%; \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n9 \n\n? Dubai Crude Oil: Reference for the Middle East and Far East markets. Sulphur \n\ncontent: 2%. \n\n2.2 REFINED OIL PRODUCTS \n\nCrude oil is never consumed \u201cas it is\u201d in final uses but undergoes refining processes, \n\nproducing many oil products which are used by both intermediate industries and end users. \n\nThe refining process in its basic form is a distillation process, where crude oil is heated in a \n\ndistillation column. The lightest components can now be extracted at the top of the column \n\nwhereas the heaviest components are taken out of the bottom of the column. To increase the \n\nyield of the more valuable lighter products, a cracking process is used, breaking up the \n\nlonger hydrocarbon molecules. Other processes are needed to remove the sulphur content. \n\nOrdered by increasing density, the most important oil products are: \n\n? Liquefied petroleum gases (LPG): Propane or butane; \n\n? Naphtha: Mainly used in chemical industry; \n\n? Gasoline: Mainly used for transportation; \n\n? Middle distillates: Kerosene, heating oil and diesel (gasoil); \n\n? Fuel oil: Used in thermal power plants and large combustion engines. \n\nOwing to the combined production process, prices of different oil products are usually \n\ntightly related to each other and can be expressed in terms of price spreads\n9\n against crude \n\noil. The lighter and more valuable products have higher spreads against crude oil than the \n\nheavier products. In special circumstances, such as a military crisis, prices for certain \n\nproducts (e.g. jet fuel) can spike upwards in relation to crude oil because of the limited \n\nrefining capacities and the limited flexibility of refineries to change the production ratios \n\namong the different products. \n\nThe European market in refined products is highly competitive, and the industry is quite \n\nlarge and developed, as Europe accounts for more than 17%\n10\n\n of total world refining \n\ncapacity. European refiners transform and move a significant amount of risk in the market \n\nsince they not only buy crude oil but also sell refined products. Both crude and refined \n\n                                                      \n\n \n\n9\n Spread is the difference between the prices of a distinct security or asset. \n\n10\n Source: BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2009. \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n10 \n\nproducts are volatile even in the short term, and correlation among these prices, especially \n\nin the medium and long term, is able to transfer downward in the energy markets a part of \n\nthe risk they incur from crude oil inputs; the rest of the risk is borne by them. Anyway, the \n\namount of risk borne directly by refiners is not trivial. In fact, the refining margin, which is \n\nthe difference between refined product prices and crude oil prices, has always been quite \n\nvolatile. \n\nThe most important refined product in Europe is gasoil, which is used for domestic heating \n\nand for transportation (diesel engines). Improvements in diesel engine technology and tax \n\nincentives have led to a strong growth of diesel consumption in Europe. Fuel oil plays a \n\nlimited role, but is still frequently used as a price reference for natural gas contracts. \n\nThe market for refined oil products in Europe is divided into NWE ARA (North-western \n\nAmsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp) and MED (Mediterranean, Genoa). \n\nOne typical financial instrument for European gasoil is Gasoil swaps\n11\n\n traded OTC\n12\n\n and \n\ntypically refer to the monthly average gasoil price (ARA or MED) as published by Platts\n13\n\n \n\nfor setting the floating payments. \n\n2.3 COAL \n\nCoal is a fossil fuel, usually with the physical appearance of a black or brown rock, \n\nconsisting of carbonized vegetal matter. It is formed plant remains that have been \n\ncompacted, hardened, chemically altered, and metamorphosed by heat and pressure over \n\ngeological time. It is used as a main source of fuel for the generation of electricity \n\nworldwide and for steel production. Coal is heterogeneous source of energy, with a \n\nsignificantly varying quality. Coal types are distinguished by their physical and chemical \n\ncharacteristics. Characteristics defining coal quality are, for example, carbon, energy, \n\n                                                      \n\n \n\n11\n A Gasoil Swap is derivative used as a hedge or as a speculative tool against the price of a physical \n\ncommodity. Its price is dependent on the price of the underlying commodity. In this case, Gasoil swap is a \n\nderivative used to hedge on the price of physical Gasoil. This commodity is traded daily on a fixed price \n\nbasis to be settled against a floating price. \n12\n\n Over-the-Counter trading is to trade financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, commodities or derivatives \n\ndirectly between two parties. It is contrasted with exchange trading, which occurs via facilities constructed \n\nfor the purpose of trading (i.e., exchanges). \n13\n\n Platts is a provider of energy and metals information and a source of benchmark price assessments in the \n\nphysical energy markets. \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n11 \n\nsulphur, and ash content. The higher the carbon content of a coal the higher its rank or \n\nquality. These characteristics determine the coal\u2019s price and suitability for various uses. \n\nThere are three main categories of coal. These are hard coal, sub-bituminous coal and \n\nlignite. \n\nFigure 2 - Types of Coal \n\n \n\nSource: World Coal Institute \n\nHard coal has a high gross calorific value greater than 5700 kcal/kg and can be categorized \n\nas follows: \n\n? Coking coal is a premium-grade bituminous coal at the top end of the quality \n\nspectrum used to manufacture coke for the steelmaking process; \n\n? Steam coal is coal used for steam raising and space heating purposes. It includes all \n\nanthracite coals and bituminous coals not classified as coking coal. As primary fuel \n\nfor hard coal fired power plants, steam coal with a calorific value greater than  \n\n6000 kcal/kg and with low moisture, ash and sulphur (less than 1%) is used. \n\nThere are two main trading regions, the Atlantic and the Pacific region. South Africa, \n\nColumbia and Russia are the main coal suppliers for the Atlantic region and Indonesia, \n\nAustralia and China for the Pacific region. There is also a small interexchange with \n\nAustralia and Indonesia supplying both the Pacific and the Atlantic region. \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n12 \n\nFigure 3 - Worldwide distribution of coal reserves \n\n \n\nSource: CIAB (2009) \n\nBecause coal transportation can be expensive, in some instances \u201cit accounts for up to 70% \n\nof the delivered cost of coal\u201d (Burguer et al., 2007), coal prices depend on the point of \n\ndelivery. Standard delivery points in international coal trading are, for example, Richards \n\nBay in South Africa, Newcastle in Australia, ARA for Central Europe or the Central \n\nAppalachian in the United States. \n\nThe characteristics defining the quality of coal also determine its price. Energy content is \n\nthe most price relevant characteristic, and quoted prices per tonne always refer to a specified \n\nquality and in particular to a specified energy content. \n\nPrice information for hard coal can be obtained either from exchanges, from brokers or from \n\nindependent information service providers. Price information published by the information \n\nservice is typically generated by telephone or e-mail survey covering sellers of physical \n\ncoal, utility buyers, trading companies and broking companies. Market analysts then assess \n\nthe price of the standard specified coal that conforms to the required specification. In \n\ncontrast to an exchange, an information service has no secured information about the \n\nconcluded trades. \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n13 \n\nTraditional Financial Services (TFS), a broker of OTC physical and derivative products, \n\naverages prices originally published by Argus Media and McCloskey\u2019s\n14\n\n and generates the \n\nwell-accepted All Publications Index (API). The TFS API indices are published in the \n\nArgus/McCloskey Price Index Report. There are the following API indices: \n\n? API#2: is the index for the NWE ARA region quoted as CIF\n15\n\n ARA and is an \n\nimportant benchmark for Central Europe. Delivery must be within the next 90 days, \n\nthe energy content is specified at 6000 kcal/kg and the sulphur content must be less \n\nthan 1%; \n\n? API#3: is the index for FOB\n16\n\n Newcastle, Australia. It is also a benchmark for CIF \n\nJapan prices by adding a Panamax\n17\n\n freight assessment. Delivery must be within the \n\nnext 90 days, the energy content is specified at 6700 kcal/kg and the sulphur content \n\nmust be less than 1%; \n\n? API#4: is the index for the FOB Richards Bay, South Africa. Delivery must be \n\nwithin the next 90 days, the energy content is specified at 6000 kcal/kg and the \n\nsulphur content must be less than 1%. \n\nThe delivery price of coal is determined in part by ocean freight rates. They are an important \n\nfactor for the price of coal in different regions and for the competitiveness of coal against \n\nother fuels. The main factor that will affect the future movement of freight rates is the \n\noverall development of dry bulk\n18\n\n trade. Mainly Cape\n19\n\n and Panama sized vessels are \n\nemployed in international coal trading. Cape sized vessels, used, for example, for the route \n\nRichards Bay to ARA, are also employed in the iron ore trade. As the shipping capacity is \n\nlimited, the activity of the world\u2019s steel industry has an impact on coal freight rates. \n\n                                                      \n\n \n\n14\n McCloskey is a premier source of news, analysis and data on the international coal industry. \n\n15\n Cost, Insurance and Freight: The selling price includes the cost of the goods, the freight or transport costs \n\nand also the cost of marine insurance. However, the transfer of risk takes place at the ship\u2019s rail. \n16\n\n Free On Board: The seller pays for transportation of the goods to the port of shipment and for loading costs. \n\nThe buyer pays for freight, insurance, unloading costs and further transportation to the destination. The \n\ntransfer of risk is at the ship\u2019s rail. \n17\n\n Panamax ships are the largest ships that can pass through Panama Canal. The size is limited by the \n\ndimensions of the lock chambers and the depth of the water in the canal. An increasing number of ships are \n\nbuilt to the Panamax limit to carry the maximum amount of cargo through the canal. \n18\n\n A bulk carrier, bulk freighter, or bulker is a merchant ship specially designed to transport unpackaged bulk \n\ncargo, such as grains, coal, ore, and cement in its cargo holds. \n19\n\n Capesize ships are cargo ships originally too large to transit the Suez Canal (i.e., larger than both panamax \n\nand suezmax vessels). \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n14 \n\n2.4 NATURAL GAS \n\nNext to oil and coal, natural gas is one of the most important primary energy sources \n\ncovering about 24% of worldwide energy consumption in 2008 (BP Statistical Review of \n\nWorld Energy, 2009). It is primarily used as a fuel for electricity generation, for \n\ntransportation and for domestic heating. \n\nNatural gas is found in the earth\u2019s crust mostly in gas or oil fields. Unlike oil, because of its \n\nlow density, gas is difficult to store and transport. In the past, gas found in oil fields was \n\nsimply burned without any economic use. With growing demand for primary energy \n\nsources, gas prices have risen and large investments have been made to build an \n\ninfrastructure for gas transportation, either in the form of pipelines or in the form of \n\nliquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals. \n\nFigure 4 - Worldwide production share of Natural Gas in 2008 \n\n \n\nSource: BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2009 \n\nThe countries with the highest gas production are Russia, the United States and Canada \n\nselling most of their gas via pipeline. LNG exports, however, are becoming more and more \n\nimportant in rising gas prices and new investments in LNG terminals are being made. \n\nCompared to oil, the natural gas market is more regional due to the high costs of gas \n\ntransportation. The following regional markets can be distinguished: \n\n19,6%\n\n19,0%\n\n5,7%\n\n55,7%\n\nRUSSIAN FEDERATION US CANADA OTHER COUNTRIES\n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n15 \n\n? The North American market; \n\n? The European market; \n\n? The Asian market. \n\nHistorically, these regional markets have had little interaction, since LNG played a \n\nsignificant role only in the Asian market. With declining gas reserves and growing demand \n\nin North America and Western Europe, the importance of LNG for these markets, and \n\ntherefore the market interaction, will increase over the next decades. \n\nAnother important issue to discuss is the contractual relationship between the different \n\nplayers of the natural gas business. Producers mostly sell the gas to intermediaries and \n\ntraders, very often through long-term contracts. Gas prices are mainly set, at least in Europe, \n\nusing algebraic formulae whose inputs are prices of other primary and secondary energy \n\nsources. The real formulae usually contain additive and multiplicative terms. There are \n\nalways time lags for the calculation of average energy input prices, consequently reducing \n\nshort-term gas price volatility. Moreover, energy input prices are generally expressed in US \n\ndollars, so exchange rates are also included in the formulae. Finally, these formulae are \n\nnever used to calculate prices on a daily basis but over longer intervals, say, every one to \n\nthree months, and during this time, prices remain fixed at the most recently calculated level. \n\nEach first partial derivative in the formula will express the sensitivity of the gas price to \n\nenergy input prices; they are normally positive and constitute a distinct feature as they \n\nchange from formula to formula. Very often, the energy input prices in the formulae are \n\ncrude and refined product prices. The price that the European importers pay for natural gas \n\nis determined by a formula set in a long-term contract, and they are usually able to sell gas \n\nto customers (power generators, firms and households) according to a very similar formula, \n\nto which they add a fixed mark-up. The result, which is often referred to as a cost \u201cpass-\n\nthrough\u201d, brings a nearly perfect contractual risk transfer and residual risk being close to \n\nzero. This long-established practice is welcomed by producers, as gas is often extracted in \n\nassociation with crude oil, and also by gas traders because this link will always assure that \n\ngas prices are competitive against the two main available substitutes, which are fuel oil in \n\nthe electricity industry and heating gasoil in the households market. \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n16 \n\nTraditionally, the European gas market has been supplied by three large exporters: Russia, \n\nNorway and Algeria. The most important gas trading hubs\n20\n\n in Europe are listed below: \n\n? The National Balancing Point (NBP) in the United Kingdom (UK): a notional \n\npoint within the UK gas pipeline network (basis for most UK gas trades); \n\n? Title Transfer Facility (TTF) in Netherlands: physical natural gas delivery at the \n\nnotional trading point, the Dutch Title Transfer Facility; \n\n? Zeebrugge in Belgium: physical natural gas delivery at the Zeebrugge hub operated \n\nby Huberator. \n\nThe continental European market and the UK market are linked by the Interconnector \n\npipeline that began operation in 1998 and by the BBL\n21\n\n pipeline that began operation in \n\n2006. The Interconnector connects the NBP gas trading hub to the Zeebrugge gas trading \n\nhub while the BBL pipeline connects the NBP gas trading hub to the TTF gas trading hub. \n\nFigure 5 - Natural Gas pipeline connections between UK and Continental Europe \n\n \n\nSource: The European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSO-G) \n\nSince the Interconnector and BBL make arbitrage trading possible between the UK and \n\ncontinental Europe (within the technical capacity restrictions of the Interconnector and BBL \n\n                                                      \n\n \n\n20\n A successful gas trading hub has two basic characteristics: first and foremost it must be possible to easily \n\nmove gas into and out of the market, whether the market is defined as a single point or as a whole area \n\n(virtual hub); second, there must be a use for the gas, either through the existence of a significant customer \n\nbase, or through the demand from other markets that can be reached from the traded hub. \n21\n\n The Balgzand-Bacton Line is a 235 kilometre pipeline between Balgzand in the Netherlands and Bacton in \n\nthe UK. \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n17 \n\npipeline), the gas spot prices at NBP, TTF and Zeebrugge are closely connected. Therefore \n\nthe spreads between NBP, Zeebrugge and TTF are most of time near zero. Besides this, \n\nthere are short periods of time where the spreads are significantly different from zero \n\n(historically, this was regularly the case when the Interconnector or BBL was shut down for \n\nmaintenance work). However, there is one circumstance that possibly turns the Zeebrugge \n\nand NBP natural gas markets into a more integrated market than TTF and Zeebrugge. This \n\ncircumstance is characterized by technical restrictions of BBL pipeline usage since it is not \n\ncapable of physical reverse flow (actually the only physical capable flow is delivering \n\nnatural gas from TTF to NBP) while natural gas in the Interconnector pipeline physically \n\nflows in both directions. \n\nFigure 6 - Spreads evolution between the major European natural gas trading hubs \n\n \n\nSource: THOMSON REUTERS (European natural gas prices in natural logarithms) \n\n \n\n-1,50\n\n-1,00\n\n-0,50\n\n0,00\n\n0,50\n\n1,00\n\n1,50\n\n0\n7\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n7\n\n0\n8\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n7\n\n0\n9\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n7\n\n1\n0\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n7\n\n1\n1\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n7\n\n1\n2\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n7\n\n0\n1\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n2\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n3\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n4\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n5\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n6\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n7\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n8\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n9\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n1\n0\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n1\n1\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n1\n2\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n1\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\n0\n2\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\n0\n3\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\n0\n4\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\n0\n5\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\n0\n6\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\n0\n7\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\n0\n8\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\n0\n9\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\n1\n0\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\nSpread log(ZEE) - log(NBP) Spread log(TTF) - log(NBP) Spread log(ZEE) - log(TTF)\n\n\n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n19 \n\n3 THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY MARKET: A BRIEF OVERVIEW \n\n3.1 ELECTRICITY MARKETS \n\nThe electricity market is characterized by a number of specific features which affect both its \n\nmarket design and the nature of competition. The most notable feature is that, unlike gas, \n\nelectricity cannot be stored on a significant scale and needs to be consumed instantaneously. \n\nThe lack of storability, coupled with the fact that final electricity demand varies \n\nconsiderably during the day and according to seasons, means that electricity production \n\nlevels need to be able to adjust rapidly on an hourly basis and have to constantly match \n\ndemand requirements. This implies that some generation capacity needs to be available \n\nprimarily to meet demand peaks (but will not be needed at lower demand levels), and that \n\nprices can rise significantly during peak periods (to allow peaking capacity to recover both \n\nits fixed and variable costs). The fact that final demand does not respond significantly to \n\nprice changes (typically because it does not face real-time prices due to the absence of \n\nhourly metering of consumption) accentuates the need for spare capacity during peak \n\ndemand periods. \n\nThe features of the electricity market described above imply that a combination of power \n\nplants is used to optimally meet demand at any given point in time. Plants with high fixed \n\ncosts and low marginal costs are used to meet baseload demand (i.e., the constant minimum \n\nlevel of demand across a time period, e.g., a year). Baseload plants typically include \n\nnuclear, run-of-river hydro plants and also renewable capacity which cannot be modulated \n\n(e.g., wind power). Plants with low fixed costs and high marginal costs (e.g., gas and/or oil \n\nturbines) are used instead to meet demand peaks. Reservoir hydroelectric power and \n\npumped storage capacity are also used to meet demand peaks. Finally, plants with \n\nintermediate marginal and fixed costs (e.g., coal and CCGT\n22\n\n plants) often operate as \u201cmid-\n\nmerit\u201d generation (i.e., they do not produce in the periods of lowest demand, but generate in \n\nall other periods). \n\n                                                      \n\n \n\n22\n Combined-Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT): an energy efficient gas turbine system, where the first turbine \n\ngenerates electricity from the gas produced during fuel combustion. The hot gases pass through a boiler and \n\nthen into the atmosphere. The steam from the boiler drives the second electricity-generating turbine. \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n20 \n\nA \u201cmerit order\u201d of plants of different technologies can therefore be constructed in \n\ngeneration markets, ranking capacity from the cheapest to the most expensive (in terms of \n\nvariable costs). Fluctuations in relative fuel prices (including CO2 emission costs) affect the \n\nposition of different technologies in the merit order (and in particular can cause the relative \n\nposition in the merit order of coal and CCGT to \u201cflip\u201d). \n\nFigure 7 - Hypothetical merit order in the wholesale electricity market \n\n \n\nSource: Competition and Regulation in the Spanish Gas and Electricity Markets (Federico and Vives, 2008) \n\nIn the paradigm, competitive generation market (i.e., one with low concentration levels), \n\nplants face incentives to offer their energy at variable cost during most hours of the year. \n\nHourly prices are therefore set at the marginal cost of the most expensive plant in the merit \n\norder that is needed to meet demand in that hour (i.e., the marginal plant). Plants with lower \n\nmarginal costs than the marginal plant can also produce during that hour and earn \u201cinfra-\n\nmarginal rents\u201d that allow them to recover their fixed costs (e.g., capital costs and fixed \n\noperation and maintenance costs). At the very peak, prices need to rise above the variable \n\ncost of the marginal plant in that hour to allow it to recover its fixed costs, and can therefore \n\nreach (in the theoretical model) the maximum willingness to pay for electricity. \n\nFor a given generation merit order, the distribution of demand levels across a given time \n\nperiod (e.g., a year) will therefore affect the distribution of electricity spot prices. Both \n\ndemand and prices can be described as annual \u201cduration curves\u201d, i.e., plots of all the \n\ndemand/price levels observed in a year (i.e., 8760 hours), which rank hourly levels from the \n\nhighest (0% duration or hour 1) to the lowest (100% duration or hour 8760). \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n21 \n\nFigure 8 - Hypothetical Load Duration Curve \n\n \n\nSource: Competition and Regulation in the Spanish Gas and Electricity Markets (Federico and Vives, 2008) \n\nCongestion on the transmission network can change the theoretically optimal merit order. In \n\nsituations of network congestion, the operator of the transmission system (which is tasked \n\nwith ensuring the perfect balance of demand and supply) will have to call on more \n\nexpensive units located in the congested area to produce, instead of plants that are willing to \n\nproduce electricity at a lower price in areas with surplus generation. \n\n3.2 THE SPANISH CASE AND MIBEL \n\nThe Spanish energy sector was liberalized in the late 1990s. The key pieces of legislation \n\nintroduced to liberalize the industry were the Electricity Law (Ley del Sector El\u00e9ctrico) in \n\n1997 for the electricity market, and the Hydrocarbons Law (Ley de Hidrocarburos) in 1998 \n\nfor the gas market. \n\nOne of the most contentious elements of the liberalization of the Spanish energy industry \n\nwas the creation of a market for electricity generation. The Spanish electricity generation \n\nmarket was established in 1998 and since then, five firms have been operating in the \n\nSpanish market as competitors: Endesa, Iberdrola, Uni\u00f3n Fenosa\n23\n\n, Hidroelectrica del \n\n                                                      \n\n \n\n23\n In 2008, Gas Natural SDG made a friendly takeover bid to buy Uni\u00f3n Fenosa. \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n22 \n\nCant\u00e1brico\n24\n\n and Electra del Viesgo\n25\n\n. The wholesale electricity market reaches a maximum \n\npeak load close to 36 GW and a yearly energy demand of about 232 TWh\n26\n\n. \n\nFigure 9 - Power Exchanges in Europe \n\n \n\nThe basic design for the Spanish market was partially based on other liberalized electricity \n\nmarkets (most notably those in the United Kingdom, Scandinavia, California and some \n\nother US markets at the time). \n\nLike the UK model, the Spanish market effectively concentrated most liquidity in a single \n\nmarketplace (creating a potentially visible and reliable price signal) and introduced a \n\nmechanism for remunerating capacity. Unlike the British market, however, in Spain \n\n                                                      \n\n \n\n24\n In 2005, Hidroel\u00e9ctrica del Cant\u00e1brico was acquired by Energias de Portugal SA. \n\n25\n In 2008, EON bought Electra del Viesgo to his major stakeholder ENEL. \n\n26\n Source: 2008 data statistics, OMEL. \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n23 \n\ngenerators could vary their bids hour by hour and were also subject to a stranded cost \n\nrecovery mechanism which reduced incentive to increase wholesale prices. \n\nAnother important market design reform implemented in the Spanish (and Iberian) \n\nwholesale electricity market in 2007 was the launch of MIBEL on 1\nst\n July 2007. Since then, \n\nthe daily market is managed by OMEL while the derivatives market is managed by OMIP\n27\n\n. \n\nGeneration units located in each country and consumption both take part in the daily market. \n\nThe method which forms the marginal clearing price is totally valid, resulting, in general, in \n\na single price for the entire Iberian system and in a flow of electric energy between the two \n\ncountries. \n\nThe method currently used to manage congestion in the interconnection is called \u201cMarket \n\nSplitting\u201d which allows solving congestion in a non-discriminatory environment for \n\noperators in addition to the reduction of problems associated to the possible existence of a \n\ndominant position. This method is similar to that used in NordPool\n28\n\n for congestion \n\nmanagement when it occurs in the interconnections between Norway, Sweden, Finland and \n\nDenmark. If there is congestion on the interconnection Spain-Portugal in any direction, \n\nOMEL runs the \u201cmarket splitting\u201d procedure (Figure 10) which basically consists of making \n\ntwo separate procedures of price formation, one for the Portuguese market players and \n\nanother for the Spanish market players taking into account the maximum amount of energy \n\nthat can be exchanged between both systems and resulting in a different price for each \n\ncountry. \n\n                                                      \n\n \n\n27\n OMIP is the managing entity responsible for the organisation of the Portuguese division of MIBEL, \n\nensuring the management of the MIBEL derivatives market, jointly with OMIClear (Energy Markets \n\nClearing Company), a company constituted and totally owned by OMIP, which has the role of Clearing \n\nHouse and Central Counterparty for operations carried out in the market. \n28\n\n Nordic electric power exchange that provides market places for trading in physical and financial contracts in \n\nthe Nordic countries (Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and recently Germany), which listed the world\u2019s \n\nfirst exchange-traded electricity futures contract in October 1995. It now operates the world\u2019s largest power \n\nderivatives exchange and also provides a carbon market for trading contracts on emission allowances and \n\ncarbon credits. In 2002, Nordpool\u2019s physical market was organized into a separate company, Nordpool Spot. \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n24 \n\nFigure 10 - Market Splitting Mechanism \n\n \n\nSource: EPEX Spot \n\nTherefore, whilst MIBEL has established the mechanism for integration between the \n\nSpanish and Portuguese markets to take place, effective integration of the two markets has \n\nnot been fully achieved yet. Greater interconnection capacity between the two systems is \n\nrequired for full market integration to take place. The expectation is also that, over time, the \n\nconvergence of market design across the two systems (e.g., the harmonization of trading \n\nrules and of the mechanism for capacity payments) should also lead to greater convergence \n\nin market structures and technology mixes, and allow for the creation of an effective single \n\nIberian market. \n\nIn practice, given the different cost structures of the wholesale markets in Spain and \n\nPortugal (this can be seen in Figure 11) and the amount of interconnection capacity (an \n\naverage of roughly 1243 MW of export capacity into Portugal during the period 1\nst\n July \n\n2007 to 31\nth\n\n October 2009), MIBEL has experienced market splitting for a significant \n\namount of the time since July 2007. \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n25 \n\nFigure 11 - Generation share by technology in the daily market OMEL (from 01/07/2007 to 31/10/2009) \n\n \n\nSpain has more diversified generation assets by technology type in the wholesale market. \n\nRenewables\n29\n\n offer their energy in the wholesale market in Spain while in Portugal their \n\nenergy is bilaterally contracted by the last resource supplier\n30\n\n. Excluding the matched \n\nenergy from the Renewables in the wholesale market, Spain has only 57% of generation \n\nshare that comes from fossil fuels thermal power plants (CCGT, thermal coal and fuel/gas \n\npower plants) while Portugal has 78%. \n\nSo, it seems that Spain is less dependent of fossil fuels power plants than Portugal due to a \n\nmore diversified generation portfolio. In Portugal, electricity generation and electricity \n\npricing is more dependent of fuel prices such as coal, natural gas and fuel oil. Looking at \n\n2008 generation statistics published by the Portuguese transmission system operator REN\n31\n\n \n\nand also by the Spanish transmission system operator REE (Figure 12), it is also possible to \n\nsee the structural differences between the generation share of each technology in each \n\ncountry, particularly in Fossil Fuel technologies. \n\n                                                      \n\n \n\n29\n Renewable energy is energy which comes from natural resources such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, and \n\ngeothermal heat, which are renewable. \n30\n\n In Portugal, the last resource supplier company is Energias de Portugal Servi\u00e7o Universal which has \n\nestablished tariffs for electricity consumers defined by the Portuguese energy regulator, ERSE. \n31\n\n Rede El\u00e9ctrica Nacional, a company of Redes Energ\u00e9ticas Nacionais Group. \n\nCOAL 43%\n\nCCGT 33%\n\nFUEL/GAS 2%\n\nHYDRO 18%\n\nOTHER 4%\n\nPORTUGAL\n\nCOAL 10%\n\nCCGT 27%\n\nFUEL/GAS 1%\n\nHYDRO 8%\nNUCLEAR 10%\n\nOTHER 12%\n\nRENEWABLES \n\n32%\n\nSPAIN\n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n26 \n\nFigure 12 - Portugal and Spain generation share by technologies (2008) \n\n \n\nNuclear is the baseload technology that makes the difference between the two electrical \n\nsystems because their variable costs are extremely low when compared with other \n\ntechnologies but with the disadvantage of having a long payback investment period to \n\nrecover the fixed costs.

The interconnection balance is 18667 GWh, \n\nindicating that, on average, the Spanish spot price is cheaper than the Portuguese Spot price. \n\nOnly 76% of the available interconnection capacity to export was used, while only 3% of \n\nthe available interconnection capacity to import was used (an average of roughly 1150 \n\nMW). \n\n20%\n\n57%\n\n49%\n\n15%\n\n8%\n\n28%\n23%\n\n0%\n\n10%\n\n20%\n\n30%\n\n40%\n\n50%\n\n60%\n\n70%\n\n80%\n\n90%\n\n100%\n\nPORTUGAL SPAIN\n\nNUCLEAR FOSSIL FUEL THERMAL HYDRO RENEWABLES\n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n27 \n\nFigure 13 - Interconnection capacity and average energy flows between Portugal and Spain \n\n \n\nHowever, it is possible to observe that during the same period the market spread prices \n\nevolution between both countries has been decreasing since the start of MIBEL (Figure 14). \n\nFigure 14 - Spreads evolution in MIBEL spot prices \n\n \n\n-2 000\n\n-1 500\n\n-1 000\n\n-500\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1 000\n\n1 500\n\n2 000\n\n7 8 9 10 11 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\n2007 2008 2009\n\nIn\nte\n\nrc\no\n\nn\nn\n\ne\nc\nti\n\no\nn\n\n C\na\n\np\na\nc\nit\n\ny\n (\nM\n\nW\n)\n\nIMPORT.

It is therefore possible to conclude that some structural changes in the \n\ndistribution of the generation share by technologies were made over time. \n\n3.3 OMEL: THE MIBEL WHOLESALE MARKET OPERATOR \n\n3.3.1 ELECTRICITY MARKET ORGANIZATION \n\nTwo independent bodies, namely the Market Operator and the System Operator are \n\nresponsible for operating the electrical system. \n\nOperador del Mercado Ib\u00e9rico de Energ\u00eda - Polo Espa\u00f1ol, S.A. (OMEL) is responsible for \n\nmanaging the daily and intra-day markets, it is also responsible for settlement and \n\ncommunication of payment obligations and collection rights deriving from the energy \n\ncontracted in the aforementioned daily and intra-day electricity production markets. \n\nFigure 15 - Economic and Technical Management of the Spanish System \n\n \n\nSource: OMEL \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n29 \n\nREE, the system\u2019s operator, is responsible for the technical management of the electrical \n\nsystem, for carrying out all those functions deriving from the operation of ancillary services, \n\nabnormalities in the electricity market, as well as for settlement and communication of \n\npayment obligations and collection rights deriving from ancillary services and the capacity. \n\nThe Portuguese system operator REN is responsible for the technical management of the \n\nPortuguese system. \n\nIn relation to its organisation, the electric energy production market involves the \n\nconjuncture of economic transactions deriving from the participation of market agents in \n\ndaily and intraday market sessions, bilateral contracts and forward contracting, as well as \n\nthe application of ancillary services and deviations. \n\nMarket agents are those bodies which are entitled to act directly in the electricity market as \n\nsellers and/or buyers of electricity. Producers, external agents, distributors and resellers can \n\nact as market agents, together with consumers of electrical power and the representatives of \n\nany of the aforementioned entities. \n\nIn this way, the deregulation model in Spain is configured as a model which enables both \n\ntrading inside an official and organised market (forward supply, daily market and intraday \n\nmarket) and trading outside of it (bilateral contracts between producers, retailers and its \n\nqualified consumers including financial contracts). A key aim of the aforementioned model \n\nis to provide different trading possibilities on equal terms for all, allowing for the right price \n\ndetermination. \n\nThe daily market includes, in addition to sale and purchase bids directed towards it, OMIP\u2019s \n\nopen positions of forward procurement, the purchases of the vendors of bilateral contracts \n\nwith distribution companies, the positions of vendors and purchasers of the primary \n\nemission auctions executed with physical delivery and the sales or purchases of energy \n\narising from the declarations of rights of use of the auctions of interconnections. \n\nOnce the daily market session has been held by the market operator, and considering the \n\nbilateral contracts executed, the system operator studies the operating schedule\u2019s technical \n\nviability to ensure the safety and reliability of the supply. If the resulting programme of the \n\ndaily market plus the bilateral contracts does not comply with safety requirements, the \n\nsystem operator resolves these technical restrictions by modifying the programme of \n\nproduction units or pumping consumption units, resulting from the daily market and from \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n30 \n\nthe bilateral contracts, proceeding to strike a balance between production and demand \n\nthrough a competitive tender procedure. \n\nThe intraday market consists of six sessions held over 24 hours period which can be \n\nattended by all agents who have participated in the daily market or executed a bilateral \n\ncontract, in compliance with the limitations set by the System Operator in order to avoid \n\nconstraints. \n\nFigure 16 - Sequence of Processes in the Electricty Market \n\n \n\nSource: OMEL \n\n3.3.2 THE DAILY MARKET \n\nThe purpose of the daily market, as an integral part of electricity power production market, \n\nis to handle electricity transactions for the following day through the presentation of \n\nelectricity sale and purchase bids by market agents. \n\n  \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n31 \n\nSubmitting bids to the daily market can be done as follows: \n\n? The open positions communicated by OMIP/OMIClear forward market will be \n\nintegrated as sale or purchase instrumental price bids; \n\n? The results of the communications of the execution of the power auctions of energy \n\npurchased by the distributors are integrated through the presentation by the sellers at \n\nthese auctions of purchase bids at instrumental price; \n\n? The results of the execution with physical delivery of the options acquired by \n\npurchasers in primary power emissions can be integrated through the presentation of \n\nsale or purchase bids at open prices; \n\n? Owners of production units that are subject to the ordinary regime submit sales bids, \n\nas long as such units are available and their energy is not linked to a bilateral \n\ncontract; \n\n? The distributors of electricity will submit specific sales bids for the amount of \n\nenergy they are required to purchase according to the special system\n32\n\n. Nevertheless, \n\nelectric energy generated by this special system is paid by a regulated tariff. In \n\nreturn, special system will sell their energy through the system of bids managed by \n\nOMEL, either directly or through their agent, by means of zero-price energy sales \n\nbids on the daily market and, as appropriate, bids on the intraday market; \n\n? External agents, retailers, and owners of production units subject to special regime, \n\ncan also submit sale bids; \n\n? Purchase bids are presented by producers for the acquisition of the ancillary services \n\nof power plants and purchasing agents owning acquisition units, whether they are \n\nresellers, distributors, consumers, external agents or holders of pumping plants. \n\n                                                      \n\n \n\n32\n Is a regime in which electric energy is produced by Renewables sources. \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n32 \n\nFigure 17 - Market Agents Transactions \n\n \n\nSource: OMEL \n\nSale and purchase bids can be made using between 1 and 25 energy blocks in each hour, \n\nwith power and prices offered in each block. In the case of sales, the bid price increases with \n\nthe block number, and it decreases in case of purchases. \n\nThe sale bids may be simple, or may include additional conditions: \n\n? Simple bids are presented for each hourly period and production unit, indicating a \n\nprice and an amount of energy; \n\n? Complex bids are those which, fulfilling the simple bid requirements, also include \n\nsome or all the technical or economic conditions. \n\nOMEL matches purchase and sale bids received prior to 10 a.m. each day, whereby the \n\nprice in each hour will be equal to the price of the last block of the sale bid of the last \n\nproduction unit whose acceptance has been required in order to meet demand that has been \n\nmatched. \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n33 \n\nFigure 18 - Daily Market Supply and Demand Curves \n\n \n\nSource: OMEL \n\nThe price or prices on the daily market are determined according to the following process. \n\nThe matching algorithm first calculates a solution by considering that all international \n\ninterconnections have unlimited import and export capacity. Once this solution has been \n\ncalculated, a check is made to see whether there is a surplus of net energy balance in any \n\none of the interconnections in the Iberian electrical system, considering bilateral contracts \n\nand declarations of use of rights. Depending on the interconnection involved, the process \n\ncontinues as follows: \n\n? In case of congestion in the French interconnection, the energy that creates \n\ncongestion will be removed in the direction of the congestion until congestion \n\ndisappears. In order to do so, the process consists of removing the energy of the units \n\nwithout previous capacity rights (those units which have not obtained rights in the \n\nexplicit auctions previous to the daily market) following the price merit order until \n\nthere is no congestion. Ifcongestion continues, energy will be taken out of the units \n\nwith previous capacity rights (those units which have obtained transmission rights in \n\nthe explicit auctions previous to the daily market) following the price merit order \n\nuntil there is no congestion; \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n34 \n\n? Once the interconnections in the Iberian system have been adjusted, the next step is \n\nto calculate the transactions between the Spanish and Portuguese systems. In the \n\nevent that the previous transactions are incompatible with the commercial capacity \n\npublished by the systems\u2019 operators market splitting is performed at the Portuguese \n\nborder. The aggregated curves of sale and purchase in both electrical systems are \n\nplotted. Each electrical system has a different price that will be the one applied to all \n\npurchase and sale bids in its electrical system at that time. \n\nThe matching result contains, for each hour, the marginal price and the schedule of \n\nproduction and demand for each electrical system established by OMEL, based on the \n\nmatching of sale and purchase bids. The results of the matching process are then \n\ncommunicated by OMEL to the system operators who receive the schedules of the units of \n\ntheir competence. \n\nThe daily base operating schedule is drawn up by each one of the system operators and the \n\nresult of the matching is accompanied by the notifications of the executions of the bilateral \n\ncontracts. \n\n \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n35 \n\n4 THEORICAL OVERVIEW \n\nMjelde and Bessler (2009:4) refer that \u201cthere are strong prior beliefs that economic data are \n\nnonstationary\u201d, meaning that any particular price measured over time will not be tied to its \n\nhistorical mean. Further, as discussed earlier, electricity and fuel prices are expected to be \n\nlinked. That is, similar economic forces are expected to influence each market; although \n\nprice or price movements are not expected to be identical across the different markets. \n\nAs Engle and Granger (1987) have pointed out, individual economic variables may be \n\nnonstationary and wonder through time, but a linear combination of them may, over time, \n\nconverge to a stationary process. Such a process, if present, may reflect the long-run \n\nequilibrium relationship, and is referred to as the cointegrating equation. To summarize, it is \n\nexpected that the different prices will be tied together, so that prices from one market will \n\nnot wander off independently of the behaviour of prices in the other markets. \n\nThe presence of a cointegrating relation among energy prices forms the basis for the \n\nspecification of the vector-error-correction model (VECM). This study uses the error-\n\ncorrection model (ECM) for electricity prices in order to capture their dynamic relations \n\nwith fuel prices and other wholesale electricity spot price data from which it would be \n\npossible to analyze the price dynamics between those prices and the Spanish wholesale \n\nelectricity spot prices. The ECM represents the change in electricity prices as a linear \n\nfunction of its past changes, past changes in fuel prices and also the other electricity prices \n\nunder analysis, and an error-correction term. For a cointegrated system, the error-correction \n\nterm represents the deviation from the equilibrium relationship. Thus, an ECM provides two \n\nalternative channels of the interaction among electricity prices and fuel prices: short-run \n\ncausality through past changes in energy prices, and long-run causality through adjustments \n\nin the equilibrium error. \n\nMoreover, it is also imperative to validate issues concerning some properties of such \n\nequilibrium relationship by studying exogeneity, proportionality and asymmetry of each \n\ncointegrated relationship. \n\n4.1 NONSTATIONARITY \n\nMost economic and financial time series that are trend stochastically nonstationary are also \n\nintegrated of first order, i.e., differencing once is enough to achieve stationarity. Suppose, \n\nfor instance, that one is interested in the long-run properties that rule the relationship \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n36 \n\nbetween two or more first-order integrated price series. In this case, one needs to focus on \n\nthe variables measured in levels. However, a linear combination of first-order integrated \n\nvariables usually generates a residual variable that is also first-order integrated. Under these \n\ncircumstances, the usual t and F tests carried out on the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) \n\nestimates do not follow, respectively, the t and F distributions and are, thus, meaningless \n\n(Phillips, 1986). What the model is most possibly capturing is a common stochastic trend \n\nbetween the variables in levels and not a causal relationship as required. Additionally, the \n\nresiduals are strongly autocorrelated and the Durbin-Watson statistic converges to zero. \n\nThus, the time series being analyzed are not related in the long-run although they may be \n\nrelated in the short-run, as is the case of the relationship between two random walks. \n\nStochastic nonstationarity can be examined on the basis of unit root tests, of which the most \n\npopular is the Augmented Dickey-Fuller or ADF test (Dickey and Fuller, 1981). \n\nThe ADF test is based on the following regression model: \n\n  (1) \n\nWhere  is a constant term,  is a linear deterministic trend in the data,  \n\ndenotes the corresponding stochastic trend and the residuals . The symbol  \n\ndenotes a first difference, as usual, and the summation term captures any autocorrelation of \n\nthe left-hand side variable. Taking , the ADF equation reduces to an AR(1) \n\nprocess. The null hypothesis in the ADF test is , using for the effect the MacKinnon \n\ncritical values (MacKinnon, 1996). \n\nThe distribution of the ADF test under the null hypothesis is given by (Dufr\u00e9not and \n\nMignon, 2002): \n\n  (2) \n\nwhere  represents a Brownian Motion over . Under the null hypothesis the \n\nvariable is nonstationary, i.e., it contains a stochastic trend. The alternative hypothesis \n\npostulates that , under which the variable is stationary. In fact, under the alternative \n\nhypothesis the time series is a stationary  process with or without deterministic \n\nterms. \n\nDespite their popularity, the ADF tests suffer from low power problems when the process is \n\nstationary with roots close to one (Blough, 1992). Additionally, some unit root processes \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n37 \n\nbehave more like a white noise than like a random walk in finite samples. By this reason, it \n\nis convenient to use alternative tests in order to conclude more accurately about the \n\nstationary nature of the series under analysis. \n\nAn alternative to the ADF test is the KPSS test (Kwaitkowski et al., 1992), which postulates \n\nin the null hypothesis that the time series is trend stationary, against the alternative that it \n\ncontains a stochastic trend. \n\nThe data generation process of the KPSS test is given by: \n\n  (3) \n\nWhere  is the sum of a deterministic trend ( ), a random walk ( ) and a stationary \n\nresidual variable ( ) and where . The null hypothesis of stationarity is \n\ngiven by  where the initial value  is a constant. Given that  is a stationary residual \n\nvariable, then  is a trend stationary process (TSP). Indeed, given the null hypothesis \n\n, the residuals  must all be zero and, therefore, , which is a constant. \n\nThus, under the null hypothesis, the first equation in (3) represents a trend stationary \n\nprocess. The test statistic of the KPSS is a Lagrange Multiplier test where the numerator is \n\nthe sum of squared residuals obtained from regressing  on a constant and a deterministic \n\ntrend and the denominator is an estimator of the variance of the residuals . \n\nAnother alternative to the tests described before is the Phillips-Perron (PP) Unit Root Tests \n\n(Phillips and Perron, 1988). Phillips and Perron have developed a more comprehensive \n\ntheory of unit root nonstationarity. This method uses nonparametric statistical methods to \n\ntake care of the serial correlation in the error terms without adding lagged difference terms. \n\nBrooks (2008:330) refers that this \u201ctest often gives the same conclusion as the ADF test\u201d. \n\nStationarity tests have stationarity under the null hypothesis, reversing the null and \n\nalternative under the Dickey-Fuller and Phillips-Perron approaches. Thus, under stationarity \n\ntests, the data will appear stationary by default if there is little information in the sample. \n\nOne such stationarity test is the KPSS test. Brooks (2008:331) argues that the results of this \n\ntest can be compared with the ADF/PP procedure to see whether the same conclusion is \n\ndrawn. The null and alternative hypotheses under each testing approach are as follows in \n\nTable 1: \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n38 \n\nTable 1 - Nonstationarity and Stationarity Hypothesis for Unit Root Tests \n\n \n\nThere are four possible outcomes: \n\n1. Reject H0 (ADF/PP) and Do not Reject H0 (KPSS); \n\n2. Do not Reject H0 and Reject H0; \n\n3. Reject H0 and Reject H0; \n\n4. Do not Reject H0 and Do not Reject H0. \n\nFor the conclusions to be robust, the results should fall under outcomes 1 or 2, which would \n\nbe the case when both tests concluded that the series is stationary or non-stationary, \n\nrespectively. Outcomes 3 or 4 imply conflicting results. The joint use of stationarity and unit \n\nroot tests is known as confirmatory data analysis. \n\n4.2 COINTEGRATION AND EC MODEL \n\nEconometric theory says that cointegration is a rigorous way of defining stable long-term \n\nrelationships between variables. So, this method was used to test and estimate the potential \n\nlong-run relationship between electricity prices and fuel costs. \n\nWe will investigate the relationships between the Spanish electricity spot prices and fuel \n\nprices using the Johansen test. The Johansen test is based on a vector autoregressive (VAR) \n\nsystem. As in Johansen and Juselius (1990), a vector , containing the  variables to be \n\ntested for cointegration, is assumed to be generated by an unrestricted  order vector \n\nautoregression in the levels of the variables: \n\n  (4) \n\nwhere each  is a  matrix of parameters,  a vector of constant terms and  \n\n. The VAR system of equations in (4) written in error correction form \n\n(ECM) is: \n\n  (5) \n\nADF/PP KPSS\n\nH0: xt ~ I(1) H0: xt ~ I(0)\n\nH1: xt ~ I(0) H1: xt ~ I(1)\n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n39 \n\nWhere  is the first difference operator, with  and \n\n. Hence,  is the long-run 'level solution' to (4). If  is a vector of  variables, \n\nthe left-hand side and the first  elements of (5) are , and the last element of (5) is \n\na linear combination of  variables. Given the assumption on the error term, this last \n\nelement must also be : . Hence, either  contains a number of \n\ncointegration vectors, or  must be a matrix of zeros. The rank of , , determines how \n\nmany linear combinations of  are stationary. If , the variables in levels are \n\nstationary; if  so that , none of the linear combinations are stationary. When \n\n, there exist  cointegration vectors or  stationary linear combinations of . In \n\nthis case one can factorize ; , where both  and  are  matrices, and  \n\ncontains the cointegration vectors (the error correcting mechanism in the system) and  the \n\nfactor loadings. Two asymptotically equivalent tests exist in this framework, the trace test \n\nand the maximum Eigenvalue test. \n\nThe test for cointegration between different variables is calculated by looking at the rank of \n\nthe  matrix via its eigenvalues\n33\n\n. The rank of a matrix is equal to the number of its \n\ncharacteristic roots (eigenvalues) that are different from zero. The eigenvalues, denoted  \n\nare put in ascending order . If the s are roots, in this context they must \n\nbe less than 1 in absolute value and positive, and  will be the largest (i.e. the closest to \n\none), while  will be the smallest (i.e., the closest to zero). If the variables are not \n\ncointegrated, the rank of  will not be significantly different from zero, so . The \n\ntest statistics actually incorporate , rather that the  themselves, but still, when \n\n, . \n\nThere are two test statistics for cointegration under the Johansen approach, which are \n\nformulated as: \n\n  (6) \n\nand \n\n  (7) \n\nWhere  is the number of cointegrated vectors under the null hypothesis and  is the \n\nestimated value of the \nth\n\n ordered eigenvalues from the  matrix. Intuitively, the larger is the \n\n                                                      \n\n \n\n33\n Strictly, the eigenvalues used in the test statistics are taken from rank-restricted product moment matrices \n\nand not of  itself. \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n40 \n\n, the more large and negative will be  and hence the larger will be the test \n\nstatistic. Each eigenvalues will have associated with it a different cointegrating vector, \n\nwhich will be eigenvectors. A significantly non-zero eigenvalues indicates a significant \n\ncointegrating vector. \n\n is a joint test where the null is that the number of cointegrating vectors is less than or \n\nequal to  against an unspecified or general alternative that there are more than . It starts \n\nwith  eigenvalues, and then successively the largest is removed.  when all the \n\n, for . \n\n conducts separate tests on each eigenvalues, and has as its null hypothesis that the \n\nnumber of cointegrating vectors is  against an alternative of . \n\nJohansen and Juselius (1990) provide critical values for the two statistics, The distribution \n\nof the test statistics is non-standard, and the critical values depend on the value of , the \n\nnumber of non-stationary components and whether constants are included in each of the \n\nequations. If the test statistic is greater than the critical value from Johansen\u2019s tables, reject \n\nthe null hypothesis that there are  cointegrating vectors in favour of the alternative that \n\nthere are  (for ) or more than  (for ). The testing is conducted in a \n\nsequence and under the null,  so that the hypothesis for  are: \n\n \n\nThe first test involves a null hypothesis of no cointegrating vectors (corresponding to  \n\nhaving zero rank). If this null is not rejected, it would be concluded that there are no \n\ncointegrating vectors and the testing would be completed. However, if  is rejected, \n\nthe null that there is one cointegrating vector (i.e. ) would be tested and so on. \n\nThus the value of  is continually increased until the null is no longer rejected. \n\n is the rank of .  cannot be of full rank ( ) since this would correspond to the original  \n\nbeing stationary. If  has zero rank, then by analogy to the univariate case,  depends \n\nonly on  and not on , so that there is no long-run relationship between the \n\nelements of . Hence there is no cointegration. For , there are  \n\ncointegrating vectors.  is then defined as the product of two matrices,  and , of \n\ndimension  and , respectively, i.e.: \n\n  (8) \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n41 \n\nThe matrix  gives the cointegrating vectors, while  gives the amount of each \n\ncointegrating vector entering each equation of the VECM, also known as the \u201cadjustment \n\nparameters\u201d. \n\nThe VEC model represented in (5) can be interpreted for example as a relationship between \n\nprices and returns in a given market. What it says is that the current returns or price changes \n\nare a linear function of previous returns or price changes and historical prices. Such \n\nhistorical prices form a long-run or equilibrium relationship, where the involved variables \n\nco-move over time independently of the existence of stochastic trends in each of them, so \n\nthat their difference is stable. The long-run residuals measure the distance of the system to \n\nequilibrium at each moment , which may be due to the impossibility of the economic \n\nagents to adjust instantaneously to new information or to the short-run dynamics also \n\npresent in the data. There is, therefore, a whole complex adjustment process involving short-\n\nrun and long-run dynamics when the variables are cointegrated. \n\n4.3 COINTEGRATED RELATIONSHIP PROPERTIES \n\n4.3.1 EXOGENEITY \n\nEconomic variables are often classified into two broad categories, endogenous and \n\nexogenous: \n\n? Endogenous variables are the equivalent of the dependent variable in the single-\n\nequation regression model; \n\n? Exogenous variables are the equivalent of the  variables, or regressors, in such a \n\nmodel, provided the  variables are uncorrelated with the error term in that equation. \n\nTo keep the exposition simple, suppose we consider only two variables,  and , and \n\nfurther suppose we regress  on . We say that  is weakly exogenous if  also does not \n\nexplain . In this case estimation and testing of the regression model can be done, \n\nconditional on the values of . As a matter of fact, you will realize that our regression \n\nmodelling was conditional on the values of the  variables.  is said to be strongly \n\nexogenous if current and lagged  values do not explain (i.e., no feedback relationship). \n\nAnd  is super-exogenous if the parameters in the regression of  on  do not change even \n\nif the  values change; that is, the parameter values are invariant to changes in the values of \n\n. \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n42 \n\n\u201cThe reason for distinguish the three types of exogeneity is that, in general, weak \n\nexogeneity is all that is needed for estimating and testing, strong exogeneity is necessary for \n\nforecasting and super exogeneity for policy analysis (Cuthbertson et al., 1990)\u201d. \n\nThe factor loadings  are of interest as they contain information about exogeneity (Johansen \n\nand Juselius, 1990), and therefore also about price leadership. If a row in  contains only \n\nzeros (or in our case one element since  is a column vector), the price in question will be \n\nweakly exogenous, or determined outside of the system. Hence, if the factor loading \n\nparameter in the equation for the exchange rate is zero, the data indicate that the exchanges \n\nrate is determined outside of the system. Furthermore, if the factor loading parameter \n\nassociated with one of the prices is zero, this price will be determined outside of the system, \n\nand therefore be the price leader. With one cointegration vector, at least one factor loading \n\nparameter must be different from zero (Johansen and Juselius, 1990). Please also note that \n\nonly in the case when just one factor loading parameter is different from zero, there will be \n\nno simultaneity problems if a system is represented with a single equation (normalized on \n\nthe correct variable). \n\nThe test used to verify the presence of weak exogeneity brings into play the matrix  in \n\nwhich contains information on the dynamic adjustment of the long run relationships. Thus, \n\nin order to test whether the price of product  drives the price of product  in a bivariate \n\ncointegrating relation, one can use a test of the null hypothesis that  ( . This \n\ntest can be applied to all price combinations of relevance to our study. If the null hypothesis \n\nis not rejected then, one says that the endogenous variable  is weakly exogenous with \n\nrespect to the parameters  (Johansen, 1991). This test follows a  distribution with one \n\ndegree of freedom. \n\nStrong exogeneity can be confirmed by the principle of Granger causality, after testing the \n\nweak exogeneity for a certain variable. Granger causality alone is neither necessary nor \n\nsufficient to establish exogeneity. On the other hand, Granger causality is necessary (but not \n\nsufficient) for strong exogeneity. \n\n4.3.2 GRANGER CAUSALITY \n\nIn econometric terms it is often necessary in practice to define a concept of \u201ccausality\u201d \n\nwhich identifies the type of relationship between two or more variables. \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n43 \n\nThe concept of causality that this section aims to analyze is called Granger causality \n\n(Granger, 1969). This type of causality is usually examined or tested in the context of VAR \n\nmodels, which contributed to make it quite popular. \n\nAlthough regression analysis deals with the dependence of one variable on other variables, \n\nit does not necessarily imply causation. In other words, the existence of a relationship \n\nbetween variables does not prove causality or the direction of influence. But in regressions \n\ninvolving time series data, the situation may be somewhat different because time does not \n\nrun backward. That is, if event  happens before , then it is possible that  is causing . \n\nHowever, it is not possible that  is causing . This is roughly the idea behind the so-called \n\nGranger causality test. \n\nAs noted above, one way to analyze the extent of market integration, is by using Granger \n\ncausality tests (Granger, 1969) which can be defined as follows:  Granger causes  if, \n\nceteris paribus, the past values of  help to improve the current forecast of , that is: \n\n  (9) \n\nwhere MSE is the mean squared error,  represents the set of all past and present \n\ninformation existing at moment ,  represents the set of all past and present \n\ninformation existing on at moment , i.e., ,  is the \n\nvalue of  at the moment  ( ) and  is a non biased predictor of . On the other \n\nhand,  instantaneously causes  in the sense of Granger if, ceteris paribus, the past and \n\npresent values of  help to improve the prediction of the current value of , that is: \n\n  (10) \n\nGiven these definitions, consider the following ADL(p, q) price relationship: \n\n  (11) \n\nwhere  ( ) denotes the prices (in natural logs) of product i at time t,  captures \n\nthe extent of autocorrelation in ,  measures the relationship between prices (in levels \n\nand lags) and  is a white noise disturbance. One can say that  causes  if the null \n\nhypothesis that all parameters  are simultaneously zero is rejected. The relationship can \n\nbe bidirectional and, in this case, we say that there is a feedback relationship. If there is just \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n44 \n\none unidirectional causal relationship, then one of the markets can effectively influence the \n\nother market prices, but the reverse is not true. If the null hypothesis is not rejected in both \n\ncases, then there is no causal relationship between the underlying prices and one can say \n\nthat they do not belong to the same market space. \n\nGujarati and Porter (2009:654) refer that causality can be distinguished in four types, as \n\nfollows: \n\n1. Unidirectional causality from  to  is indicated if the estimated coefficients on \n\nthe lagged  are statistically different from zero as a group (i.e. ) and a set \n\nof estimated coefficients on lagged  is not statistically different from zero (i.e. \n\n); \n\n2. Unidirectional causality from  to  is indicated if the estimated coefficients on \n\nthe lagged  are statistically different from zero as a group (i.e. ) and a set \n\nof estimated coefficients on lagged  is not statistically different from zero (i.e. \n\n); \n\n3. Feedback or Bilateral causality is suggested when the sets of lagged  and  \n\ncoefficients are statistically significantly different from zero in both regressions; \n\n4. Independence is suggested when the sets of lagged  and  coefficients are not \n\nstatistically significant in both regressions. \n\nMore generally, since the future cannot predict the past, if variable  (Granger) causes \n\nvariable , then changes in  should precede changes in . Therefore, in a regression of \n\n on other variables (including its own past values) if we include past or lagged values of \n\n and it significantly improves the prediction of , then we can say that  (Granger) \n\ncauses . \n\n4.3.3 PROPORTIONALITY \n\nThe Johansen procedure allows hypothesis testing on the coefficients  and , using \n\nlikelihood ratio tests (Johansen and Juselius, 1990). In this case, restrictions on the \n\nparameters in the cointegration vectors  should be considered. More specifically, in our \n\ncase there are two data series in the  vector. Provided that the data series cointegrate and \n\nwe find one cointegration vector due to bivariate cointegration, the rank of  is equal \n\nto 1 and  and  are ( ) vectors. A test of full price transmission is a test of whether \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n45 \n\n and is distributed as . This restriction can be tested for each pair of \n\nprices making  and  in matrix . \n\n4.3.4 ASYMMETRY \n\nTwo important tests are used for testing asymmetry, the threshold autoregressive (known as \n\nTAR) and momentum threshold autoregressive (known as MTAR) models as in Enders and \n\nGranger (1998), Enders and Siklos (2001) and Enders (2001). These models allow verifying \n\nasymmetries in the dynamics of the adjustment between the Spanish electricity spot prices \n\nand the other independent data in study (fuel prices and electricity spot prices from near \n\ncountries). \n\nMore specifically, let the long-run relationship among electricity prices and fuel costs be \n\nrepresented by: \n\n  (12) \n\nWhere  is the equilibrium error. Examination of the long-run relationship using the TAR \n\nand M-TAR models requires estimating Equation (12), obtaining the residuals, , \n\nestimating the following modified ADF model: \n\n  (13) \n\nWhere . The Heaviside indicator, , differs between the TAR and MTAR \n\nmodels. In the TAR model  is set according to: \n\n  (14) \n\nWhile in the M-TAR model, it is set as according to: \n\n  (15) \n\nTAR and M-TAR models allow the residuals to exhibit different degrees of autoregressive \n\ndecay depending on the behaviour of the lagged residual and its first-difference respectively. \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n46 \n\nTAR model allows for different coefficients for positive and negative variations. \u201cA \n\nsufficient condition for the stationarity of  is \u201d (Menezes and Dion\u00edsio, \n\n2003). \n\nThe TAR model is also designed to capture asymmetrically \u201cdeep\u201d movements in the series \n\nof the deviations from the long-run equilibrium. Furthermore, the M-TAR model allows the \n\nresidual series to exhibit more momentum in one direction than the other, useful to capture \n\nthe possibility of asymmetrically \u201csteep\u201d movements in the series. \n\nThe test statistic  and  are used to test the null hypothesis of no-cointegration (that is \n\n, which we obtain the sample values of the F-statistic) in the TAR and M-TAR \n\nmodels respectively. Critical values are reported in Enders and Siklos (2001). If the null \n\nhypothesis of no cointegration is rejected, then one may proceed to test for the null \n\nhypothesis of symmetry (that is , hypothesis tested using the usual F-statistic). If the \n\nnull hypothesis of symmetry is rejected and  then the model exhibits more decay for \n\npositive (changes in) errors. \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n47 \n\n5 DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS AND GRAPHICAL OVERVIEW \n\nThis section carries out a descriptive analysis of the daily Spanish wholesale electricity spot \n\nprices in euros per MWh (POOL_ES), the daily Portuguese wholesale electricity spot prices \n\nin euros per MWh (POOL_PT), the daily French wholesale electricity spot prices in euros \n\nper MWh (PNX), the daily coal OTC prices in euros per ton (API2 and API4 index), the \n\ndaily European crudes OTC prices in euros per barrel\n34\n\n (BRENT, FORTIES and URALS), \n\nthe daily gasoil OTC prices as a European refined oil product in euros per ton (GO_ARA) \n\nand the daily European natural gas OTC prices in euros per MWh (NBP, TTF and ZEE). \n\nThe daily Spanish, Portuguese and French electricity spot prices are defined by the \n\narithmetic average of the day-ahead hourly price per day considered in the study period. The \n\nday-ahead wholesale electricity spot prices for Spain (POOL_ES) and Portugal (POOL_PT) \n\nare formed in the OMEL power exchange. The French electricity spot prices are formed in \n\nEPEX Spot power exchange, a former cooperation between the French Power Exchange \n\nPowernext (PNX) and the German Power Exchange (EEX). \n\nThe indicated coal price series, as mentioned in Chapter 2, represent the CIF price reference \n\n(API2) and the FOB price reference (API4) for Europe. The difference between API2 and \n\nAPI4 gives an approximation to the freight cost for the maritime route between South Africa \n\nand North-western Europe. \n\nThe indicated crude oil price series have the following specifications: \n\n? Brent Crude Oil (BRENT): UK Brent crude oil is a blend of crude oil from various \n\nfields in the East Shetland Basin between Scotland and Norway in the North Sea. \n\nThe crude is landed at the Sullom Voe terminal and is used as a benchmark for the \n\npricing of much of the world\u2019s crude oil products. Currently, the API gravity\n35\n\n is \n\nestimated at 38 degrees and the sulphur content at 0.45% sulphur, but the qualities of \n\nall crude oils tend to change over time; \n\n                                                      \n\n \n\n34\n Standard measure of quantity for crude oil and petroleum products (Barrel, US Barrel and standard barrel \n\nare all equal to 42 US gallons). \n35\n\n The American Petroleum Institute gravity, or API gravity, is a measure of how heavy or light petroleum \n\nliquid is compared to water. \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n48 \n\n? Forties Crude Oil (FORTIES): Physical Forties crude oil is produced in the Forties \n\noilfield (the largest oilfield in the UK sector of the North Sea, 110 miles east of \n\nAberdeen). The assessment for Forties blend is based on FOB Hound Point, UK. \n\nCurrently, the API gravity of Forties is 40.3 degrees and the sulphur content is \n\naround 0.58%; \n\n? Urals Crude Oil (URALS): The assessment for Urals is based in Russia. Urals is an \n\noil benchmark that aggregates a mix of Russian oil exports. It is a mix of heavy \n\ncrude oil from the Volga and Urals regions with light crude oil from western Siberia. \n\nUrals crude oil is supplied through Novorossiysk pipeline system and Druzhba \n\npipeline. API gravity is approximately 32 degrees. The sulphur content reflects the \n\nnormal pipeline quality which is typically 1.3%. \n\nDue to different crude oil specifications, these European crude oil prices will be considered \n\nin this analysis. \n\nGasoil price data (GO_ARA) has also been chosen to represent a refined oil product \n\nbecause of its market liquidity. One gasoil price reference for Europe is the European NWE \n\nFOB gasoil (typically the FOB assessment is derived at a freight differential to the CIF \n\nassessment, based on the following routes: Ventspils, Antwerp, Stockholm) assessments \n\ncurrently reflect 0.1% maximum sulphur as a result of European Union directives aimed to \n\nreduce the sulphur in gasoil to 0.1% maximum. \n\nIn Europe, as mentioned in Chapter 2, there are three major natural gas trading hubs \n\ninterconnected between them. In this study, natural gas prices data from NBP, TTF and ZEE \n\nwill also be considered. \n\nThe study covers the period starting on July 1\nst\n, 2007 and ending on October 31\n\nth\n, 2009. \n\nThis sample period was chosen to coincide with the date in which MIBEL (the Iberian \n\nElectricity Market) started (July 1\nst\n, 2007). \n\nAll data came from the market information platform THOMSON REUTERS 3000XTRA. \n\nThese data series are denominated in euros. In series quoted in US dollars such as crude oil \n\ndata, coal data and gasoil data, a daily exchange rate conversion have been applied using the \n\ndaily foreign exchange spot rate USD/EUR. In series quoted in British pounds (GBP) such \n\nas NBP data and ZEE data, a daily exchange rate conversion has also been applied using the \n\ndaily foreign exchange spot rate GBP/EUR. \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n49 \n\nWorking days are used because, although POOL_ES, PNX and POOL_PT are available for \n\nall calendar days, the other data are only available for working days. In the case of holidays, \n\nthe missing value is replaced by the last trading value. \n\nThe number of observations used in each series is 854. \n\nFor all data, a natural logarithm transformation has been computed to deal with asymmetry \n\nand nonnormality and also because it make it easier to visualize the data in analysis (the \n\npoints will be spread more uniformly in the graph). \n\nThe data are analyzed using the econometric software EVIEWS for Windows V6.0. \n\nSummary statistics of these series are shown in Table 2. \n\nTable 2 - Summary descriptive statistics \n\n \n\nLog Descriptive Stats API4 API2 BRENT FORTIES URALS GO_ARA\n\n Mean 4,087 4,271 3,979 3,971 3,949 6,174\n\n Median 4,043 4,212 4,018 4,009 3,968 6,182\n\n Maximum 4,785 4,955 4,516 4,514 4,486 6,725\n\n Minimum 3,705 3,749 3,186 3,135 3,136 5,601\n\n Std.

This result is also confirmed by the Jarque-Bera test. \n\nTime plots of the natural logarithm of each price series are given in Figure 19.

The standard error of skewness: . \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n51 \n\nPNX is about 1.6 greater than the volatility of the wholesale electricity spot prices formed in \n\nMIBEL. One reason that can justify this is the market liquidity of MIBEL. When compared \n\nwith Powernext, Portugal and Spain combined have a spot volume traded in OMEL of \n\naround 290 TWh. Besides this, Powernext has less volume, with a total of 82 TWh of \n\nelectricity traded. The reason for such less liquidity in the French electricity market is due to \n\na major percentage of bilateral power contracts settlement between power producers and \n\nretailers. Portugal and Spain are more integrated than France and Spain (the correlation \n\nbetween POOL_ES and POOL_PT is 0.950; the correlation between POOL_ES and PNX is \n\n0.694). \n\nFigure 20 - Wholesale electricity spot prices \n\n \n\nSource: THOMSON REUTERS \n\nIn Figure 21, it is possible to see the evolution of both API4 and API2 against POOL_ES. \n\nCoal prices increased steadily throughout 2007 and 2008, with rapid increases in the Asian \n\nmarket leading the way and illustrating the effect that Chinese demand for coal, other \n\ncommodities and shipping continues to have on world markets.

However, the economy had already started to slow down, most \n\nlikely not unrelated to the high price of energy and to the T financial crisis which started in \n\nSeptember 2008 and later triggered a sharp recession \u2013 with critical implications for global \n\nenergy consumption. Crude oil prices collapsed, falling by more than 70% by the end of \n\n2008. All crude oil prices have the same volatility as POOL_ES.

In a similar manner to the prices of other energy commodities, \n\nnatural gas prices were also affected by declining economic activity. Both natural gas prices \n\nhave higher volatility than POOL_ES (around 0.14). Observing the correlations between \n\nthese series, all natural gas prices have basically the same correlation levels with POOL_ES \n\n(around 0.81 and 0.83). The correlation levels of each of the European Natural gas prices \n\nwith the others are near perfect correlation (around 0.98). Meanwhile, it seems that NBP and \n\nZEE have a more approximated volatility value (NBP has 0.148 and TTF has 0.144) rather \n\nthan TTF (with 0.137). Checking correlations between both natural gas prices, the \n\ncorrelation value between NBP and TTF is approximately the smaller value (0.98) when \n\ncompared with other bivariate correlations. So, this distinct behaviour of TTF against NBP \n\nand ZEE can be justified by the fact that NBP and ZEE are common fungible products while \n\nTTF is not (British pounds is the currency used to quote NBP and ZEE while TTF is quoted \n\nin euros). The usage restriction of the BBL pipeline (with single flow direction of natural \n\ngas) that connects the TTF market with the NBP market could also be an important factor \n\nwith strong impacts on the correlation between TTF and NBP. \n\n3,00\n\n3,50\n\n4,00\n\n4,50\n\n5,00\n\n5,50\n\n6,00\n\n6,50\n\n7,00\n\n0\n7\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n7\n\n0\n8\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n7\n\n0\n9\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n7\n\n1\n0\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n7\n\n1\n1\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n7\n\n1\n2\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n7\n\n0\n1\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n2\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n3\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n4\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n5\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n6\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n7\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n8\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n9\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n1\n0\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n1\n1\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n1\n2\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n1\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\n0\n2\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\n0\n3\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\n0\n4\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\n0\n5\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\n0\n6\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\n0\n7\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\n0\n8\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\n0\n9\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\n1\n0\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\nlog(GO_ARA) log(POOL_ES)\n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n55 \n\nFigure 24 - European Natural Gas prices and the Spanish wholesale electricity spot prices \n\n \n\nSource: THOMSON REUTERS \n\n \n\n1,00\n\n1,50\n\n2,00\n\n2,50\n\n3,00\n\n3,50\n\n4,00\n\n4,50\n\n5,00\n\n0\n7\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n7\n\n0\n8\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n7\n\n0\n9\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n7\n\n1\n0\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n7\n\n1\n1\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n7\n\n1\n2\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n7\n\n0\n1\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n2\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n3\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n4\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n5\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n6\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n7\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n8\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n9\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n1\n0\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n1\n1\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n1\n2\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n1\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\n0\n2\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\n0\n3\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\n0\n4\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\n0\n5\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\n0\n6\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\n0\n7\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\n0\n8\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\n0\n9\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\n1\n0\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\nlog(TTF) log(ZEE) log(NBP) log(POOL_ES)\n\n\n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n57 \n\n6 EMPIRICAL FINDINGS \n\nAfter examining Figure 19, it seems intuitively clear that the time series under analysis are \n\nnonstationary time series in the sense that they move together, which means that the \n\ndifference between observations at any given time remains approximately constant \n\nthroughout the whole time period. This is the intuitive idea of cointegration, introduced by \n\nGranger (1981) and later published by Engle and Granger (1987) in their seminar paper. \n\nAs has been previously mentioned, the concept of cointegration is applied to nonstationary \n\ntime series; so before testing cointegration, it will be necessary to check if these time series \n\nare integrated of order one\n37\n\n. \n\nConsidering cointegration as a global characteristic of the series while threshold behaviour \n\nas local characteristic (Balke and Fomby, 1997), the analysis is conducted as follows: \n\n1. First the degree of integration of the variables was tested by using the augmented \n\ntest of Dickey and Fuller (Said and Dickey, 1984) known as ADF test, the  \n\nPhilips\u2013Perron test (PP) and also the Kwiatkowski\u2013Phillips\u2013Schmidt\u2013Shin test \n\n(KPSS); \n\n2. Second, bivariate cointegration analysis was made by using the Johansen \n\nCointegration test. Both trace statistic and maximum eigenvalue statistic were used \n\nto confirm the presence of one cointegrating long-run relationship between \n\nPOOL_ES and each variable in study. With the cointegration condition valid, a VEC \n\nmodel estimation for each cointegration relationship was made; \n\n3. Finally, the properties of exogeneity, proportionality and asymmetry of each \n\ncointegrating relationship were analyzed. \n\nAll the empirical analysis followed the principle of parsimony proposed by Granger\n38\n\n in \n\n1990. \n\n                                                      \n\n \n\n37\n  in abbreviated form. \n\n38\n If two models appear to fit the data equally well, choose the simpler model (that is the one involving the \n\nfewest parameters). This principle is proposed by Box and Jenkins (1972) when considering the modelling of \n\ntime series. They suggest that the fewer parameters that have to be estimated, the better estimates will result. \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n58 \n\n6.1 UNIT ROOT TESTS AND NONSTATIONARITY \n\nTable 3 shows the results of the ADF, PP and KPSS tests, where the  in front of every \n\nvariable name indicates the differentiated series. \n\nTable 3 - Unit Root and stationarity tests in levels and in first differences \n\n \n\nNotes: a) exogenous terms in levels: constant and linear trend (MacKinnon critical values: -3.96 ~ 1% and \n\n-3.41 ~ 5%); b) exogenous terms in 1\nst\n differences: constant (MacKinnon critical values: -3.43 ~ 1% and \n\n-2.86 ~ 5%); c) exogenous terms in levels and 1\nst\n differences: none (MacKinnon critical values: -2.56 ~ 1% \n\nand -1.94 ~ 5%); d) exogenous terms in levels and 1\nst\n differences: constant (KPSS critical values: 0,73 ~ 1% \n\nand 0,46 ~ 5%); e) automatic lag length based on SIC\n39\n\n; f) automatic lag length based on Newey-West using \n\nBartlett kernel; g) 25 lag length fixed based on Bartlett kernel. \n\n                                                      \n\n \n\n39\n Optimum lag lengths are based on Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC). \n\nVariables\n\nAPI4 -1,556821 -0,047841 0,929356 **\n\nAPI2 -1,780020 -0,340710 1,548652 **\n\nBRENT -1,464773 -0,182589 1,343613 **\n\nFORTIES -1,512793 -0,190653 1,320776 **\n\nURALS -1,526983 -0,121613 1,233448 **\n\nGO_ARA -1,526558 -0,213790 1,537871 **\n\nTTF -2,881464 -0,186579 1,674533 **\n\nZEE -3,099051 -0,133243 1,802888 **\n\nNBP -2,931282 -0,186595 1,716500 **\n\nPNX -2,627483 -0,121424 0,641809 *\n\nPOOL_PT -1,526576 -0,194723 1,395568 **\n\nPOOL_ES -1,715359 0,036374 0,978581 **\n\nAPI4 -28,619410 ** -28,687250 ** 0,455187\n\nAPI2 -22,468920 ** -28,653440 ** 0,400462\n\nBRENT -30,018950 ** -30,052960 ** 0,161225\n\nFORTIES -30,413970 ** -30,446620 ** 0,150894\n\nURALS -30,467520 ** -30,501980 ** 0,156881\n\nGO_ARA -32,025530 ** -31,984280 ** 0,206697\n\nTTF -28,779070 ** -28,794860 ** 0,417435\n\n-24,423090 ** -39,261880 ** 0,391727\n\nNBP -24,991140 ** -39,805190 ** 0,338879\n\nPNX -9,082943 ** -84,796160 ** 0,086777\n\nPOOL_PT -9,346984 ** -50,180180 ** 0,261421\n\nPOOL_ES -9,437233 ** -48,964720 ** 0,337606\n\n(**) and (*) indicate the reject of the null at 0,01 and 0,05 significance levels\n\nADF\na,b,e\n\nPP\nc,f\n\nKPSS\nd,g\n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n59 \n\nIt emerges that all the differentiated price series are .

Apart from this, the results are, therefore, consistent in both \n\ncases and lead to the conclusion that the logarithm of price series\n40\n\n under analysis are, in \n\nfact, integrated of first order . \n\nThus, it is possible to conclude that all energy prices are first-difference stationary, and \n\nproceed with tests of cointegration. \n\n6.2 COINTEGRATION AND ESTIMATED VEC MODEL \n\n6.2.1 COINTEGRATION \n\nSince the price series are all nonstationary and integrated of the same order, cointegration \n\nanalysis is the appropriate tool for investigating the relationships between POOL_ES and \n\nthe other considered prices series under analysis. \n\nThe proposed methodology for doing this is investigating the bivariate relationships \n\nbetween the POOL_ES and each other considered price series, considering many VAR \n\nsystems as the relevant price combinations, and tested for the presence of cointegration and \n\nthe optimum lag length following the well known Johansen procedure (Johansen, 1988, \n\n1992; Johansen and Juselius, 1990), which involves a system based on a likelihood ratio test \n\nthat contemplates two steps. Firstly, the lag number of VAR representation is determined \n\nusing information matrices based on Akaike (1973), Hannan and Quinn (1979) and Schwarz \n\n(1978) information criteria (IC). Secondly, given the optimal lag length, the cointegration \n\nrank is obtained through the Trace test and the Maximum Eigenvalue test (both test statistics \n\nhave non-standard distributions and their critical values have been tabulated by Johansen in \n\n1988). \n\nThe two tests are used to determine the rank of the coefficient matrix , i.e., the Trace and \n\nthe Maximum Eigenvalue test, are reported in Table 4.  \n\nThe column Rank  identifies the null hypothesis of each cointegration test performed. \n\nHere,  corresponds to the null hypothesis that there are no cointegrating vectors, that \n\n                                                      \n\n \n\n40\n In what follows, when prices are referred it means logarithm of prices. \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n60 \n\nis, the cointegrating rank is zero, and  corresponds to the null hypothesis that there is \n\nat most one cointegrating vector, that is, the cointegrating rank is less than or equal to one. \n\nThe next column reports the eigenvalues for each hypothesis.

The results also mean that the variables in \n\nquestion should be exogenous, the remainder being endogenous, as will be confirmed in the \n\nnext section. \n\n6.3 EXOGENEITY \n\nA test for weak exogeneity will provide information as to whether any of the considered \n\nprice series are price leaders, finding which price actually adjusts to maintaining the long-\n\nrun equilibrium (Asche et al., 1999). Following Johansen (1992, 1995), a weak exogeneity \n\ntest has been applied to each series, testing every element of the adjustment matrix \n\ncoefficient against zero. The likelihood ratio test is  distributed with degrees of freedom \n\nequal to the number of cointegrating vectors. \n\nThe weak exogeneity results are reported in Table 6. \n\nAPI4 -0,948218 -118,5870 ** -0,056292 -3,2859 **\n\nAPI2 -0,770165 -9,1189 ** -0,057831 -4,1687 **\n\nBRENT -0,974806 -53,2769 ** -0,025529 -3,7009 **\n\nFORTIES -0,976917 -51,5636 ** -0,025033 -3,7039 **\n\nURALS -0,982637 -51,9056 ** -0,025021 -3,6871 **\n\nGO_ARA -0,628294 -65,3028 ** -0,026108 -2,7505 **\n\nTTF -0,895236 -9,2667 ** -0,033000 -2,3659 *\n\nZEE -0,921927 -7,9522 ** -0,022689 -1,7782\n\nNBP -0,871451 -7,6251 ** -0,019970 -1,5469\n\nPNX -0,985181 -93,4229 ** -0,013617 -1,6433\n\nPOOL_PT -0,979847 -224,0200 ** -0,075691 -3,0838 **\n\n(**) and (*) indicate the reject of the null at 0,01 and 0,05 significance levels\n\n?

Nevertheless, for each one of these weak exogenous variables remains only a \n\nshort-term relationship between one of these weak exogenous variable and POOL_ES. \n\nWeak exogeneity of NBP, ZEE and PNX also implies that these same prices cannot be used \n\nto forecast POOL_ES in the long-run. For this to be also the case in the short-run, these \n\nprices must be strongly exogenous and hence not affected by the short-run movements in \n\nPOOL_ES.\n43\n\n Moreover, this weak exogeneity test shows that TTF is endogenous to \n\nPOOL_ES, probably because some long-term oil indexed contracts still dominate in this \n\nmarket, setting up the TTF spot price. \n\nHowever, some remarks\n44\n\n made by the International Energy Agency (IEA) refer that the \n\nmajority of natural gas in UK is sold at the NBP prices (around 60%), while the remainder \n\nis sold by long-term oil indexed contracts. Research by Neumann et al. (2005) has provided \n\nevidence that there is a strong evidence of market integration between NPB and ZEE (see \n\n                                                      \n\n \n\n43\n See Hendry (1996) for a discussion of different exogeneity concepts and their implications. \n\n44\n See Cronshaw et al.

It is possible to say that the \n\nFrench wholesale electricity spot price (PNX), where evidence of strong exogeneity was \n\nfound, doesn\u2019t have a long-term and a short-term relationship with POOL_ES. \n\nTable 7 - Granger Causality test \n\n \n\nNotes: H0:  is not Granger Cause of  ( ) \n\nA possible justification for this strong exogeneity of PNX could be the fact that PNX is a \n\nprice formed in the day-ahead spot market Powernext, separated from the Iberian market by \n\ninterconnections with limited capacity (interconnections capacity restrictions between \n\ncountries is also an issue that can create some obstacles to a greater market integration \n\namong adjacent markets). \n\nMoreover, the share structure of the French wholesale electricity market is quite different \n\nfrom the Spanish one (in terms of levels of demand and technologies supported) with \n\ndifferent fuel price references associated to French generation assets in the wholesale \n\nmarket. Correlation levels between PNX and POOL_ES and the PNX price volatility \n\n(measured by coefficient of variation) when compared with POOL_ES could demonstrate \n\nthis fact as referred in Chapter 5.

The other considered prices are proportional with POOL_ES. These results indicate \n\nthat changes in crude oil prices, natural gas prices and also in the French wholesale \n\nelectricity spot prices are fully reflected in the prices of the Spanish wholesale electricity \n\nspot prices, but only partly in coal, gasoil and in the electricity spot prices formed in \n\nPortugal. However, it is important to remember that the following price series are weak \n\nexogenous: the natural gas prices NBP and ZEE and also PNX. So, it is not correct to affirm \n\nthat changes in these variables are fully reflected in POOL_ES because these variables in \n\nquestion do not have long-run relationships with POOL_ES. So, the only variables that fail \n\nto reject the possibility of being proportional with POOL_ES are crude oil prices and the \n\nTTF natural gas. \n\nIn Figure 26 it is possible to see the evolution of the electricity volume by thermal \n\ntechnologies matched over 95% of marginal price POOL_ES.

If there were more capacity available \n\ndue to new interconnections investments between Portugal and Spain, probably the \n\nconvergence to a unique MIBEL spot price would occur, with full price transmission \n\nbetween POOL_PT and POOL_ES. \n\n6.5 ASYMMETRY \n\nTo conclude the empirical analysis presented here, this section shows the results of \n\nasymmetry tests conducted on the residuals of each long-term equation, with the aim of \n\nconfirming the symmetrical adjustment of the estimated models. \n\n-0,25\n\n0,00\n\n0,25\n\n0,50\n\n0,75\n\n1,00\n\n1,25\n\n-250\n\n0\n\n250\n\n500\n\n750\n\n1 000\n\n1 250\n\n7 8 9 10 11 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\n2007 2008 2009\n\nE\nle\n\nc\ntr\n\nic\nty\n\n V\no\n\nlu\nm\n\ne\n (\n\nG\nW\n\nh\n)\n\nSpread [log(POOL_PT) - log(POOL_ES)] Interconnexion Balance [ES?PT] (GWh)\n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n70 \n\nUsing the threshold methodology (TAR and MTAR approach) as described in Section 4.3.4 \n\nin order to verify whether price adjustment of each considered price series in analysis is \n\nasymmetric to POOL_ES.

The \n\nresults of Enders and Siklos (2001) show that standard tests of cointegration exhibit low \n\npower in the presence of asymmetric cointegration and consequently failure to detect \n\ncointegration using standard tests may be due to presence of asymmetric behaviour. \n\nPOOL_PT is the only independent variable that is asymmetric with POOL_ES in \u201csteep\u201d \n\nmovements (at 5% significance level there is rejection of the null hypothesis of symmetry \n\ntest applied to the MTAR equation). Moreover, POOL_PT doesn\u2019t exhibit different degrees \n\nof autoregressive decay depending on the behaviour of the lagged residual and its first-\n\ndifference respectively because the asymmetry test applied to TAR equation doesn\u2019t reject \n\nthe null hypothesis of symmetry).

By \n\nincluding both fuel (inputs) and electricity (output) prices, this study shows that there are \n\ndynamic relationships between input and output prices which confirm that electricity prices \n\nare directly impacted by fuel prices. It is also relevant to analyze the dynamic relationship \n\nbetween interconnected systems (Spain and Portugal, Spain and France), using as an input \n\nthe electric spot price formed in each electrical system, because it might also have an impact \n\non the evolution of the Spanish wholesale electricity spot prices. \n\nThe first finding in this study is that Spanish wholesale electricity spots prices, the fuel \n\nprices and wholesale electricity spot prices formed in Portugal and France are cointegrated \n\n(nonstationarity of each price data was confirmed). Therefore, there is a long-term \n\nequilibrium relationship between the Spanish wholesale electricity spot prices and coal \n\nprices, crude oil prices, gasoil prices, Portuguese wholesale electricity spot prices and TTF \n\nnatural gas prices. Short-term relationships have been detected between Spanish wholesale \n\nelectricity spot prices and natural gas prices from NBP and Zeebrugge natural gas hubs. \n\nLong-term relationships between the Spanish wholesale electricity spot prices and crude oil \n\nprices, gasoil prices and TTF natural gas prices show that crude oil prices directly or \n\nindirectly (setting the price of refined oil products and natural gas) also have an impact on \n\nelectricity prices, even though crude oil plays a minor role as a primary energy source for \n\nelectricity generation. This increasing dependence on these inputs, coupled with the fact that \n\nCCGTs are often the price-setting technology in OMEL, implies that the link between the \n\ngas and electricity markets is crucial to an understanding of the dynamics of both markets. \n\nIn addition, the long-term relationship between the wholesale electricity spot prices formed \n\nin Portugal and Spain is justified by the integration of Portugal and Spain in the same \n\nwholesale market, MIBEL, which confirms why the Portuguese wholesale electricity spot \n\nprice evolution is strongly linked to the Spanish wholesale electricity spot price evolution. \n\nThe second finding determined that the French wholesale electricity spot prices were \n\nstrongly exogenous to the Spanish wholesale electricity spot prices. Comparing the two \n\nelectrical systems, the generation structure share of the French wholesale electricity market \n\nis quite different from the Spanish one (in terms of levels of demand and technologies \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n74 \n\nsupported) with different fuel price references associated to French generation assets in the \n\nwholesale market. The difference between the market liquidity in each market is also an \n\nissue that could create greater price volatility in the French market when compared to the \n\nmore liquid Spanish market. Less liquidity in France is due to a higher percentage of \n\nbilateral power contracts entered into by power producers and retailers. Furthermore, \n\nanother issue that can contribute for the presence of exogeneity in the French wholesale \n\nelectricity spot prices is the price transmission in two interconnected systems with limited \n\ncapacity, because it is a physical restriction that could create some obstacles to greater \n\nmarket integration among adjacent markets. \n\nThird, no proportionality was found between coal prices, gasoil prices and the Portuguese \n\nwholesale electricity spot prices and the Spanish wholesale electricity spot prices. Coal \n\nprices and gasoil prices are partly reflected in the Spanish wholesale electricity spot price \n\nbecause the remaining thermal coal and Fuel/Gas power plants have a minor influence on \n\nsetting up the marginal price of the Spanish wholesale electricity market. Moreover, \n\nchanges in the Portuguese wholesale electricity spot prices are partly reflected in the \n\nSpanish wholesale electricity spot prices because throughout the analysis period, Portugal \n\nhas imported more electric energy than exported it (with higher electricity spot prices than \n\nthe ones in Spain because of the \u201cmarket splitting\u201d mechanism) due to different structural \n\nmarket conditions in which Spain has considerably more efficient power generation assets \n\nthan Portugal. \n\nHowever, there is a full price reflection between the crude oil prices, TTF natural gas and \n\nthe Spanish wholesale electricity spot prices. Given the fact that CCGT is the major \n\nmarginal technology that sets up the power pool prices and CCGT fuel is natural gas, full \n\nreflection of the crude oil prices and TTF in the natural gas formula of the long-term natural \n\ngas supply should certainly occur. \n\nFourth and finally, the Portuguese wholesale electricity spot prices are asymmetric in \n\nrelation to the Spanish wholesale electricity spot prices in \u201csteep\u201d movements. The \n\ndifference between both prices (spreads) over time may give a perspective of this \n\nmovement. Basically, during the second half of 2007, following the official start of MIBEL, \n\nmajor spreads were found when compared with the remaining period. This fact may indicate \n\nthat some structural changes occurred over time in the distribution of the generation share \n\nby technologies in Portugal. \n\n\n\nECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS \n\n \n\n75 \n\nREFERENCES \n\nAgung, I.G.N.
