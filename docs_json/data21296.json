Therefore, performance based tests should play an impor-\ntant role through an integrated design process starting from site investigation,\ndesign, construction and maintenance. In this context, full scale trials assume\ngreat importance to establish a methodology either on the establishment of com-\npaction conditions and on promoting continuous stiffness evaluation, aiming to\nmeet high quality requirements and reduce construction time. This is devel-\noped through this study involving advanced laboratory and field investigations\nof different materials.\n\nA laboratory test campaign was performed on two materials, a clayey sand\nand a crushed aggregate employed in field investigation. Void ratio was fixed for\neach material and molding water content was varied in order to reproduce in situ\nstate conditions. Strength and stiffness were determined by means of triaxial\ntests. Focus was given to hydro\u2013mechanical behaviour on the very small and\nlarge strain domain of clayey sand due to non negligible fine fraction. Results\nshowed marked influence of molding water content on the hydro\u2013mechanical\nbehaviour of both clayey sand and crushed aggregate, yet being stronger on the\nformer material.\n\nField investigation involved two full scale trials, a railway and a road trial\nembankments. In the railway trial embankment the same materials studied on\nthe laboratory investigation were employed. Construction of trial layers with\ndifferent thicknesses (0.22, 0.30, 0.40 and 0.50 m) and different moisture con-\ntents (2% dry of optimum, optimum and 2% wet of optimum Modified Proctor)\nwere carried out and state conditions and mechanical properties were evaluated\nfor several energy levels. Focus was given to mechanical evaluation through spot\nand continuous test methods. Moisture content was found to strongly influences\nmechanical performance, rather than density, thus reflecting suction effect on\nmechanical properties. Comparison between laboratory and field results proofs\nresults consistency. Further, continuous mechanical evaluation by means of Por-\ntanceme?tre represents a great improvement on quality control/quality assurance\n(Qa/Qc) of compacted layers.\n\nIn road trial embankment another two materials were employed, which lab-\noratory investigation was conducted in the aim of another doctoral thesis. Con-\nstruction of trial layers with different thicknesses (0.30, 0.40 and 0.50 m) but\n\nix\n\n\n\nwith similar moisture contents were carried out and, likewise to railway trial\nembankment, state conditions and mechanical properties were evaluated for\nseveral energy levels. Moisture content was found have unnoticeable influence\non moduli for the range of moisture content verified in situ. Conversely, dry\ndensity seems to influence mechanical properties, as long as moisture content\ndoes not vary significantly. Comparison between full scale trial and laboratory\nresults yielded small differences. This results along with the ones obtained from\nrailway trial embankment assumes great importance taking into account that\ndesign is based on mechanical properties usually determined from laboratory\ntests.\n\nParallel to this study, an experimental program was carried out on road\nembankment to monitor, on one hand, layer in\u2013ground vibrations during appli-\ncation of impact loads and vibrating loads and, on the other hand, to monitor\nroller drum roller during compaction seeking to explore the relationship between\nloads and underlying material mechanical properties. Accelerometers and strain\ngauges were buried on the capping layer enabling measurement of dynamic re-\nsponse and total strains. In\u2013ground dynamic response reflect a single modulus,\nthough different moduli obtained from dynamic tests performed at layer surface.\nFurther, vertical drum behaviour was found to be sensitive to changes in under-\nlying material stiffness and to be related with in\u2013ground dynamic response.\n\nKeywords: Compaction conditions, moisture content, mechanical behaviour,\nmodulus, stiffness, strength, unsaturated state, full scale trial, in\u2013ground strain\nand dynamic response.\n\nx\n\n\n\nSuma?rio\n\nOs aspectos importantes que governam os aterros ferrovia?rios, nomeada-\nmente linhas fe?rreas de alta velocidade, sa?o, por um lado, os elevados requisitos\ndurante a construc?a?o (qualidade dos materiais, limites para as condic?o?es de es-\ntado e para as propriedades meca?nicas) associadas a um tempo de construc?a?o\nreduzido e, por outro lado, os elevados requisitos relativos aos assentamentos\nresiduais durante as condic?o?es de servic?o, que sa?o inerentes ao comportamento\nmeca?nico durante e apo?s a construc?a?o. Assim, a avaliac?a?o meca?nica atrave?s de\nensaios mecanicistas devera? desempenhar um papel preponderante num processo\nque integra a prospecc?a?o, o projecto, a construc?a?o e a manutenc?a?o. Neste con-\ntexto os aterros experimentais assumem grande importa?ncia quer na definic?a?o\ndas condic?o?es de compactac?a?o, quer na promoc?a?o do controlo de compactac?a?o\nem cont??nuo visando atingir os elevados requisitos de qualidade e a reduc?a?o\ndo tempo de construc?a?o. Tal e? desenvolvido no presente estudo que envolve a\ninvestigac?a?o avanc?ada em laborato?rio e em campo de diferentes materiais.\n\nA campanha de laborato?rio foi realizada sobre dois materiais, uma areia\nargilosa e um agregado britado, utilizados na investigac?a?o de campo. O ??ndice\nde vazios foi fixado para cada material tendo-se feito variar o teor em a?gua\nde modo a reproduzir as condic?o?es de estado em campo. Os para?metros de\nresiste?ncia e de rigidez foram determinados atrave?s de ensaios triaxiais. Foi\ndado especial enfoque ao comportamento hidro\u2013meca?nico no dom??nio das muito\npequenas e grandes deformac?o?es da areia argilosa devido a? fracc?a?o fina na?o\nnegligencia?vel. Os resultados obtidos mostram clara influe?ncia do teor em a?gua\nno comportamento hidro\u2013meca?nico de ambos os materiais, sendo essa influe?ncia\nmais evidente na areia argilosa.\n\nO estudo de campo compreendeu dois aterros experimentais, um aterro fer-\nrovia?rio e um aterro rodovia?rio. Os mesmos materiais estudados em laborato?rio\nforam utilizados no aterro ferrovia?rio. Procedeu-se a? construc?a?o de camadas\nexperimentais com diferentes espessuras (0.22, 0.30, 0.40 and 0.50 m) e difer-\nentes teores em a?gua (2% do lado seco do o?ptimo, o?ptimo e 2% do lado hu?mido\ndo o?ptimo em relac?a?o ao Proctor Modificado) e a? avaliac?a?o das condic?o?es de\nestado e do comportamento meca?nico para va?rios n??veis de energia. Especial\nenfoque foi dado a? avaliac?a?o meca?nica atrave?s de ensaios pontuais e cont??nuos.\nOs resultados mostraram grande influe?ncia do teor em a?gua, maior do que a in-\nflue?cia da densidade, no comportamento meca?nico dos materiais o que reflecte o\nefeito da succ?a?o nas propriedades meca?nicas. A comparac?a?o entre os resultados\nde campo e de laborato?rio confirmou a consiste?ncia dos mesmos. Para ale?m\ndisso, concluiu-se que a avaliac?a?o meca?nica em cont??nuo por meio da utilizac?a?o\ndo Portanceme?tre representa um progresso significativo no controlo/garantia de\nqualidade das camadas compactadas.\n\nxi\n\n\n\nO aterro experimental rodovia?rio envolveu a utilizac?a?o de dois materiais,\ncujo estudo laboratorial foi desenvolvido no a?mbito de outra tese doutoral. As\ncamadas experimentais foram constru??das com diferentes espessuras (0.30, 0.40\nand 0.50 m), mas com teores em a?gua semelhantes e, assim como para o aterro\nferrovia?rio, as condic?o?es de estado e o comportamento meca?nico foram avaliados\npara va?rios n??veis de energia. Para os teores em a?gua encontrados em campo\nverificou-se que o teor em a?gua teve pouca influe?ncia no mo?dulo das camadas.\nPelo contra?rio, a densidade seca parece influenciar as propriedades meca?nicas,\ndesde que na?o se verifique uma grande variac?a?o do teor em a?gua. A comparac?a?o\ndos resultados de campo com os de laborato?rio mostraram pequenas diferenc?as.\nNa linha do conclu??do para o aterro experimental ferrovia?rio, estes resultados\nassumem grande importa?ncia se se tiver em conta que o projecto tem por base\nas propriedades meca?nicas dos materiais determinadas em laborato?rio.\n\nParalelamente a este estudo, no aterro rodovia?rio realizou-se um programa\nexperimental visando, por um lado, a monitorizac?a?o de vibrac?o?es em profun-\ndidade durante a aplicac?a?o de cargas de impacto e visando, por outro lado,\na monitorizac?a?o do rolo do cilindro procurando explorar a relac?a?o entre as\ncargas aplicadas e as propriedades meca?nicas. Acelero?metros e extenso?metros\nforam instalados em profundidade na camada de leito de pavimento permitindo\na medic?a?o da resposta dina?mica e das extenc?o?es totais. A resposta dina?mica em\nprofundidade reflecte um u?nico mo?dulo, apesar de diferentes mo?dulos obtidos\natrave?s dos ensaios dina?micos realizados a? superf??cie. Para ale?m disso, verificou-\nse que o comportamento do rolo do cilindro e? sens??vel a? mudanc?a de rigidez do\nmaterial e que esta? relacionado com a resposta dina?mica em profundidade.\n\nPalavras-chave: Condic?o?es de compactac?a?o, teor em a?gua, comportamento\nmeca?nico, mo?dulo, rigidez, resiste?ncia, estado na?o saturado, aterro experimen-\ntal, resposta dina?mica

Usually railways embankments\nand railtrack layers are constructed on compacted geomaterials that are typ-\nically in unsaturated condition during construction and may remain in that\ncondition during the working life of the structure. Several design and main-\ntenance measures are undertaken to maintain unsaturated conditions because\nthey provide favorable engineering materials properties, namely shear strength\nand deformability.\n\nIn practice, routine rail track design is based on rational methods using\nYoung modulus (E) and Poisson\u2019s ratio (?). These parameters are generally\ndetermined in terms of total stresses, even though materials used in railways\nconstruction are not completely saturated or completely dry. This approach is\nconservative to varying degrees to that the influence of soil suction is ignored,\nalthough it plays a fundamental role on the hydro\u2013mechanical behaviour. In\nturn, the hydro\u2013mechanical behaviour is influenced by compaction conditions.\nTo this end, the influence of compaction conditions on the hydro\u2013mechanical\nbehaviour assumes great importance.\n\nTraditionally, compaction control is carried out by means of different spot\ncheck methods, used systematically or statistically, aimed at determining the\ngeomaterials state parameters (density and moisture content) or layers deforma-\nbility (E modulus). Even though state parameters of geomaterials are not the\nmost desired engineering properties, it has used widespread for many years be-\ncause it can be easily determined via weight and volume measurements. The\nmeasurement of geomaterial density and moisture content allows the determi-\nnation of relative compaction and moisture content deviation which are in fact\nparameters used on compaction control. Although state parameters enable to\ndetermine if adequate compaction has been achieved, it does not allow control-\nling the characteristic values normally considered in design. Therefore, it is\ncurrent to determine the E modulus, which is an important design parameter\nfor embankments, particularly, to transportation infrastructure. This property\nis usually evaluated by means of static plate load tests (SPLT). However, the\ncurrent quality control/quality assurance (Qc/Qa) methods are time consuming,\n\n1\n\n\n\n2 Introduction\n\nlabor\u2013intensive and costly. For instance, the determination of density with the\nwater balloon method takes about 45 minutes excluding the time for weighting\nand drying the sample and the radiometric probe test takes about 5\u201315 minutes,\nas a SPLT takes at least 30 minutes, besides the need of heavy equipment to\nguarantee reaction force. The main reason for the adoption of such quality con-\ntrol methods is their relatively simplicity and can be applied to generate data\nfor a statistical evaluation of compaction quality (Lenke et al., 2003).\n\nThe strict requirements on quality construction of railway embankments,\nnamely, high\u2013speed railways, demands higher quality compaction control. The\nreduce construction time, the required high homogeneity of mechanical proper-\nties of compacted layers in order to avoid overcompaction and to minimize rel-\native settlements of the embankment platform during serviceability conditions,\nthus, seeking to minimize the exploration costs, are important aspects that dis-\ntinguish this structures from conventional earthworks, like road embankments.\n\nRecently, there is a strong trend towards using stiffness and strength to con-\ntrol compaction given the importance of these mechanistic properties in pave-\nment materials evaluation (Briaud, 2001; Loizos et al., 2003; Alshibli et al.,\n2005; Edil and Sawangsurya, 2005). Mechanistic properties are a measure of\nquality since non\u2013uniformity of stiffness and/or strength is directly related to\nprogressive failures and life\u2013cycle cost. Moreover, the design method of pave-\nments is based on engineering parameters of materials such as their stiffness\nand/or strength, which results in a missing link between the design process and\nconstruction quality control. As a result, the Qc/Qa procedures of construc-\ntion should be based on a criterion that closely correlates to the performance\nparameters used in the design.\n\nIncreasing demands for better, cheaper and faster compaction control have\nlead to technology improvements. In this context, devices for field test eval-\nuation of mechanical properties of geomaterials have been recently developed,\nnamely: impact tests (falling weight deflectometer \u2013 FWD and light falling\nweight deflectometer \u2013 LFWD), the soil stiffness gauge (SSG) and Spectral\nAnalysis of Surface Waves (SASW). These are non\u2013destructive spot tests meth-\nods which can be conducted independently and in conjunction with conventional\nmoisture content and density testing improving statistical evaluation and allow-\ning variability reduction, thus substantially enhance construction quality of the\nentire earthwork. This notwithstanding, these new devices involves different\ntest methods which are not standardised and, therefore, it demands their in\nsitu evaluation.\n\nCompaction is commonly carried out by vibrating rollers which vibration\nfrequency and amplitude is kept constant and the operator chooses the roller\nspeed. Compaction of a certain area is carried out by parallel strips (edge to edge\nor with some overlapping) covering each strip with a fixed number of passes.\nHowever, a certain number of passes and a constant roller speed, vibration\nfrequency and amplitude do not necessarily lead to a homogeneous compaction\nresult on a layer due to variation in material properties, water content of the\nlayer being compacted, and stiffness of the underlying layer. A constant number\nof passes and constant roller parameters will often leave a certain part of the area\ninsufficiently compacted, another part over\u2013compacted and the rest sufficiently\ncompacted (Briaud and Seo, 2004). Therefore neither proof rolling nor the\ndemand to compact until no further deformation behind the compacting drum\nwill ever be able to meet modern requirements on a homogeneous compaction\n\n\n\nObjectives 3\n\nresult (Thurner and Sandstro?m, 2000).\n\nThough new spot test methods may represent an improvement on Qc/Qa,\nspot test method can never reliably represent the compaction result of the entire\narea. In addition, some of these test methods requires the delay or stop con-\nstruction work, because the tests have to be carried out without any disturbing\nvibrations around the test spot. Regarding high quality projects as high speed\nrailways, where rigorous deformation criteria of the structure soil\u2013railtrack must\nbe satisfied, continuous compaction control (CCC) approach represents a fairly\nimprovement. In this scope, in the early years equipments promoting CCC have\nbeen developed, namely, Portanceme?tre (Quibel, 1999) and devices embarked\non the roller drum (Thurner and Sandstro?m, 1980; Adam, 1996; Thurner and\nSandstro?m, 2000; Anderegg, 2000; Anderegg and Kaufmann, 2004; Mooney and\nRinehart, 2007). Moreover, if a feedback control of one or more of the roller drum\nvibration parameters (vibration frequency, force amplitude, and forward veloc-\nity) is employed, then compaction control could be done by compaction equip-\nment itself and optimization of compaction could be achieved independently of\nequipment\u2019s operator resulting, in that so called intelligent compaction.\n\nHowever, the relationship between dynamic loads, namely those applied\nby dynamic tests (LFWD, FWD and Portanceme?tre) and vibratory roller be-\nhaviour, and in situ dynamic response is not well understood. A better un-\nderstanding of the in\u2013ground dynamic behaviour of the soil in response to the\nloadings imparted by these devices will aid in the development of CCC as well\nas the refinement and acceptance of rapid spot test devices.\n\n1.2 Objectives\n\nThe main objective of this research work is to investigate the influence of\ncompaction on the behaviour of railway embankments and consequently for\nhigh quality road embankments. This is seeking through laboratory and field\ninvestigations.\n\nField investigation consists on two full scale trial that have been performed\non a railway embankment and another trial has been carried out on a road em-\nbankment. The execution of these trials was greatly conditioned by the impos-\nsibility to fully perform the initially planned work, in the aim of a cooperation\nprotocol between the National Railway Network and and four national research\ninstitutions (University of Minho, UM; National Laboratory of Civil Engineer-\ning, LNEC; New University of Lisbon, FCT/UNL; and Technical University of\nLisbon, IST) to develop the knowledge concerning the methodology for the con-\nstruction and control of the railway embankments and rail track layers for high\nspeed trains. This was established under the framework of a national research\nproject POCI/ECM/61114/2004, entitled \u201cInteraction soil\u2013rail track for high\nspeed trains\u201d, financed by the Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT).\nIn this protocol was planned:\n\n- Execution of a trial embankment to establish a methodology of construc-\ntion for optimization of embankments performance;\n\n- Construction and observation of two definitive railway embankments, one\nbuilt according to traditional technologies of construction and control, and\n\n\n\n4 Introduction\n\nanother built according with the new technologies of construction and con-\ntrol. During the construction of definitive embankments instrumentation\nand monitoring during and post construction would be done. This would\nallow comparison of performances from the two embankments, as well as\neventual comparison with numerical models developed in this context.\n\nIn the aim of this protocol it was only possible to perform the trial embank-\nment, which is called hereafter E?vora Trial Railway Embankment (ETRE).\n\nHowever, another contract between the Centre for Waste Valorisation (CVR)\nand Portuguese Steel Companies (SN), including University of Minho, allows to\nobtain more knowledge about this subject also under the framework of another\nNational Research program founded by FCT. In fact, a trial road embankment\nwas constructed, giving the possibility to carry out different studies using spot\nand continuous compaction control tests, as well as the instrumentation of the\nembankment and road layers to measure vibrations and strains induced by the\ncompaction equipment and dynamic tests. Hereafter this trial embankment is\nreferred to as Fafe Trial Road Embankment (FTRE).\n\nField investigation aimed to study the influence of compaction conditions,\nspecifically, water content, compaction energy level and layers thicknesses on the\nbehaviour of compacted layers, particularly, mechanical behaviour. Attempting\nto get a higher degree of homogeneity in what concerns to state parameters, the\nwater adding procedure employed on earth dams is used on both full scale trials.\nFurthermore, focus is given to the establishment of a methodology for quality\ncontrol of compacted layers by using spot methods and continuous approach.\nIn this scope, new devices for field test evaluation of mechanical properties of\ngeomaterials, namely: LFWD, FWD, SSG, SASW and Portanceme?tre, will be\nevaluated using SPLT as a reference test. Correlations between SPLT and per-\nformance related tests are attempted. In addition, the evolution of modulus,\nrelative compaction and moisture content with the number of passes is investi-\ngated in order to understand the influence of state conditions on the mechanical\nperformance of trial layers. Moreover, the homogeneity of either state param-\neters and mechanical properties will be evaluated for the last energy level and\ncompared with specifications given in literature. Finally, field tests results and\nlaboratory tests results will be compared attempting to establish a link between\ndesign mechanical properties usually obtained from laboratory investigation and\nactual in situ mechanical properties.\n\nConcerning to ETRE, two geomaterials employed in railway embankment\nand railway track layers were studied (clayey sand and crushed aggregate). In\naddition to aforementioned, the SPLT was performed following two commonly\nused standards (AFNOR NF P94\u2013117\u20131 (2000) and DIN 18134 (2001)) with\nthe objective to develop a specification of the plate loading test to be used as a\nreference method. This specification project will be then employed on FTRE.\n\nWith regards to FTRE, it is intended to study compaction conditions, specif-\nically, compaction energy level and layers thicknesses, of two geomaterials tradi-\ntionally employed in road embankments (poor\u2013graded silty sand and a crushed\naggregate) and another resulting from processed steel slag aggregates produced\nin National Iron and Steel Company (inert steel aggregate for construction\n\u2013 ISAC). In addition, on FTRE it is intended to investigate the in\u2013ground\nresponse of compacted geomaterials during field testing with SPLT, LFWD,\nFWD, Portanceme?tre and vibrating roller drum. To this end, in\u2013ground strain\n\n\n\nThesis layout 5\n\ngauges and accelerometers were installed in embankment layers to measure in\u2013\nsitu static and dynamic response. Furthermore, the roller was outfitted with\naccelerometers to monitor drum acceleration seeking to explore the relationship\nbetween roller drum vibration characteristics and underlying soil properties,\nnamely soil stiffness.\n\nThe laboratory investigation aims to study the influence of compaction mold-\ning water content on the hydro\u2013mechanical behaviour of two geomaterials (clayey\nsand and a well graded gravel) employed on ETRE, reproducing in situ state\nconditions. The laboratory investigation regarding material employed on FTRE\nwas performed in the scope of another doctoral thesis (Reis Ferreira, 2010).\nLarge strain domain will be investigated for both materials, where strength and\nstiffness parameters will be determined through a multistage procedure and\ncompared to single stage procedure. Specimens will be compacted to the same\ndry density and with different molding water contents, including the ones em-\nployed on field investigation, in order to study the influence of moisture content\non strength and stiffness. Focus will be given to clayey sand characterization.\nBesides large strain tests, also investigation on the very small strain domain of\nclayey sand will be carry out, where stiffness will be determined by means of seis-\nmic wave measurements. A technique employing bender elements in conjunction\nwith accelerometers will be attempted aiming to evaluate the advantages of this\nprocedure on seismic measurements of high stiffness materials. Further, mod-\nulus degradation curves will be computed to verify if fits a reference threshold\nfor sands given in literature. In addition, hydro characterization (suction\u2013water\ncontent relationship) will be performed in order to highlight the influence of\nunsaturated condition on the small and large strain mechanical behaviour.\n\n1.3 Thesis layout\n\nThe work presented in this thesis has been divided in eight chapters. Follow-\ning this chapter, Chapter 2, entitled Compaction, presents a general overview\nof compaction equipments and technologies and of compaction control. With\nrespect to former issue, focus is given to devices embarked on compactors and\nintelligent compaction. Concerning the latter issue, specifications for high speed\nembankments and rail track layers are addressed and new techniques on spot\ntests method, namely SSG, FWD, LFWD and SASW, as well as continuous test\nmethod by means of Portanceme?tre are highlighted.\n\nChapter 3, entitled The influence of compaction on the hydro\u2013mecha\u2013\nnical behaviour of geomaterials, reviews basic concepts on unsaturated ge-\nomaterials and describes the influence of compaction conditions on the hydro\u2013\nmechanical behaviour of either saturated and unsaturated geomaterials. It first\nstarts to present suction phenomena on unsaturated geomaterials and measuring\ntechniques focusing on filter paper method, which was employed in this research\nwork, and to present the soil water characteristic curve (SWCC), also known as\nsoil water retention curve (WRC), which empirically describes the relationship\nbetween water content and suction. Then, stress state variables are addressed,\nwhere the effective stress approach and independent state variable approach are\npresented. Finally, the influence of compaction variables, namely, molding wa-\nter content, compaction energy and compaction method, on the WRC, stiffness,\ncompressibility and strength of either saturated and unsaturated materials are\n\n\n\n6 Introduction\n\nreviewed.\nChapter 4, entitled Experimental program, presents the experimental\n\nprogram adopted, which was developed in three parts, namely, a laboratory in-\nvestigation and field investigation performed on a railway embankment and an-\nother field investigation carried out in a road embankment. Laboratory investi-\ngation involves physical, hydro and mechanical characterization of geomaterials\nemployed in field investigations. Laboratory tests are briefly described and tests\nstate conditions are summarized. The field investigation is divided accordingly\nto the type and location of trial embankments: E?vora railway trial embankment\n(ETRE) and Fafe road trial embankment (FTRE). The methodology adopted\nin field investigations is described, namely, materials and experimental plan.\nFurthermore, regarding FTRE, the instrumentation of an experimental section\nwith in\u2013ground accelerometers and strain gauges, as well as the instrumentation\nof a roller drum with two accelerometers is described.\n\nChapter 5, entitled Laboratory investigation, presents the results ob-\ntained from physical, hydro and mechanical characterization of materials em-\nployed in field investigations. Main results are presented for the geomaterials\nstudied, yet focus is given to the results on the very small strains.\n\nChapter 6, entitled Field investigation: E?vora trial railway embank-\nment (ETRE), deals with the results obtained from in situ tests. Firstly, the\nstate conditions obtained from sand cone method (SCM) and nuclear method\n(NM) on each trial layer are presented. Secondly, moduli obtained from SPLT,\nLFWD, SSG, Portanceme?tre, FWD and SASW are presented. Concerning\nSPLT, comparison between moduli obtained from SPLT using two measure-\nment devices is carried out. In addition, comparison between moduli obtained\nfrom direct interpretation of SPLT following AFNOR NF P94\u2013117\u20131 (2000) and\nDIN 18134 (2001) standards is carried out, as well as, comparison between mod-\nuli obtained from the interpretation of SPLT to the same stress and method.\nFollowing results presentation, comparison between moduli obtained from dif-\nferent tests is carried out by material type. Then, analysis of the evolution of\nmodulus, relative compaction and moisture content with the number of passes is\npresented and homogeneity of these parameters are evaluated for the last energy\nlevel. Finally, field tests results and laboratory tests results are compared.\n\nChapter 7, entitled Field investigation: Fafe trial road embankment\n(FTRE), presents the main results obtained from in situ tests. Similarly to pre-\nvious chapter, the state conditions obtained from SCM, NM and rubber ballon\nmethod (RBM) on each trial and embankment layers are presented. Secondly,\nmoduli obtained from SPLT, LFWD, SSG, Portanceme?tre, FWD and SASW are\npresented, following comparison between moduli obtained from different tests is\ncarried out by material type. Then, analysis of the evolution of modulus, relative\ncompaction and moisture content with the number of passes is presented and\nhomogeneity of these parameters is evaluated for the last energy level. Further,\nfield tests results and laboratory tests results are compared. Finally, results\nfrom monitoring of roller drum and in\u2013ground vibrations during compaction\nand application of dynamic loads from LFWD, FWD, Portanceme?tre and roller\ndrum are presented.\n\nChapter 8, entitled Conclusions, summarizes the main conclusions gathered\nthroughout this research work. The limitations and obstacles encountered in\nthis research are also revealed, which suggest room for further improvements\nand developments.\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nCompaction\n\n2.1 Introduction\n\nIn soil mechanics soil compaction means the mechanical action that might\nlead to a decrease of void ratio, mainly achieved by the volume reduction of the\ngas phase. It is generally understood as a quick process, even sudden sometimes,\nthrough which it seeks to introduce in the soil marked structural changes in order\nto create a new type of storage of particles.\n\nIn general the performance of a soil, specifically their characteristics, shear\nstrength, deformability and permeability, depend on its void ratio. Thus, the\nlower the void ratio, the greater is usually its shear strength and less are de-\nformability and its permeability. Exception must be made, however, to \u201csensiv-\nity\u201d materials, such as clay materials, to which this behaviour does not apply\n(Guedes de Melo, 1985). Therefore, reducing the soil\u2019s void ratio by compaction,\nit is possible to improve its performance to future loadings. Compaction is,\ntherefore, a critical element in the construction of transportation infrastructure\n(highways, railways, airports, etc.) and energy infrastructures (earth dams).\n\nIn what follows a brief review of compaction equipments and technologies\nwill be presented focusing on devices embarked on compacters and intelligent\ncompaction. Then, compaction control will be addressed and new techniques\non spot tests method, namely soil stiffness gauge (SSG), falling weight deflec-\ntometer (FWD) and light falling weight deflectometer (LFWD), and spectral\nanalysis of surface waves (SASW), as well as continuous test method by means\nof Portanceme?tre will be reviewed in detail.\n\n2.2 Compaction equipments and technologies\n\nRollers are widely used for compacting soil, fill, and asphalt. The selection\nof roller depends on characteristics of material to be compacted and machine\nparameters. Material characteristics are related to layer thickness and material\nproperties like grain size distribution, maximum grain size and grain shape,\nwater content, water and air permeability. The machine parameters include\ntotal roller weight and static drum load, static or dynamic compaction, and\nthe diameter and surface shape of the drum (smooth or sheepfoot). In case of\n\n7\n\n\n\n8 Compaction\n\ndynamic compaction it must be considered the direction of resulting dynamic\ncontact force, excitation frequency and theoretical drum amplitude.\n\nTraditionally, soil and rock fill materials are compacted with static or vi-\nbrating rollers. Rollers with static drums use the effective dead weight of the\nmachine to apply pressure on the surface. Thus, soil particles are pressed to-\ngether and the void content is reduced. Adequate compaction with static rollers\nis normally achieved only in the upper layers of the material, i.e., the effective\ndepth of static compaction is limited.\n\nAs reported by Adam and Kopf (2000), dynamic rollers make use of a vibrat-\ning or oscillating mechanism, which consists of one or more rotating eccentric\nweights. During dynamic compaction, a combination of dynamic and static load\nis used. The dynamically excited drum delivers a rapid succession of impacts to\nthe underlying surface where the particles are set in motion by the transmission\nof compressive and shear waves. These vibrations eliminate periodically the\ninternal friction between particles and facilitate, in combination with the static\nload, the rearrangement of the particles into positions that result in a lower\nvoid ratio and a higher density. Furthermore, the increase in the number of\ncontact points and planes between the grains leads to higher stability, stiffness,\nand lower long\u2013term settlement behaviour. If dynamic load is applied vertically\nor horizontally, rollers are denominated as vibratory or oscillatory, respectively.\nHowever, by means of two counter\u2013rotating exciting masses, there are roller\nwhich enables the application of vertical, inclined and horizontal loads, as is\nillustrated in Figure 2.1. That is the case of, for example, the VARIO roller\ndeveloped by BOMAG Company.\n\nFigure 2.1: Adjustable excitation direction of a VARIO roller drum and com-\npaction effect (Adam and Kopf, 2000)\n\nMore recently there has been an increasing interest in vibration\u2013based mon-\nitoring of roller compactors to provide continuous assessment of the soil mecha-\nnistic properties, namely stiffness and/or modulus, during compaction process.\nWith this aim, devices are embarked on compactors and roller\u2013based measures\nof soil compaction are determined, e.g. relative indices or soil stiffness. If feed-\nback control is employed on compactors, then so called intelligent compaction\nis achieved.\n\n2.2.1 Devices embarked on compactors\n\nThurner and Sandstro?m (2000) reported the early research in Sweden that\nrevealed that motion behaviour of dynamically excited roller drum changed in\n\n\n\nCompaction equipments and technologies 9\n\ndependence of the soil response. A test roller had been equipped with triaxial\naccelerometers, a mini roller behind the compacting roller was intended to reg-\nister vibrations passing from the large to the mini roller and triaxial geophones\nwere buried in the ground in order to measure ground vibrations, as shown in\nFigure 2.2.\n\nFigure 2.2: Test recordings of vibrations on the roller, a mini roller and geo-\nphones (Thurner and Sandstro?m, 2000)\n\nSimultaneous recordings from all sensors were analysed and it was found that\nthe accelerometer on the roller gave significant changes in the time history of\nthe sensor signal. The changes could be related to the increase of the stiffness\nin the layer, documented by spot tests after each roller pass. The evaluation\nof these tests led to the development of roller integrated compaction using the\nroller drum as the measuring tool for instant and continuous compaction control\n(Thurner and Sandstro?m, 2000). This was the starting point which led roller\u2019s\nconstructors to propose devices embarked on compactors with the following\npurposes:\n\n- provide instantly and continuously relative information to the roller oper-\nator, enabling him to evaluate where compaction work is finished, where\nadditional passes are required and what sections cannot be sufficiently\ncompacted with the present roller;\n\n- get an indication concerning the bearing capacity of a layer at the end of\ncompaction.\n\nIn 1978, Geodynamik developed and introduced the compaction meter and\nthe compaction meter value (CMV) and many of the roller manufacturers, e.g.,\nCaterpillar, Ingersoll Rand, subsequently adopted the Geodynamik CMV\u2013based\nsystem. In the late 1980s, Bomag developed the Omega value and corresponding\nTerrameter. The Omega value provided a continuous measure of compaction\nenergy. In the late 1990s, Bomag then developed a measurement value Evib\nwhich provides a measure of dynamic soil modulus (Kro?ber and Floss, 2001).\nAmmann followed suit with the development of a soil stiffness parameter ks\n(Anderegg and Kaufmann, 2004).\n\nIn the following sections are explained the various roller\u2013determined dy-\nnamic measurement values in use today, namely compaction meter value (CMV),\nOmega value, roller\u2013determined stiffness (ks) and vibration modulus (Evib).\n\nCompaction Meter Value (CMV)\n\nCompaction meter is a product of the Swedish company Geodynamic AB\nand the first patent was taken out in 1978. Forssblad (1980) showed that var-\nious indices incorporating drum acceleration amplitude and the amplitude of\n\n\n\n10 Compaction\n\nits harmonics (i.e., multiples of the excitation frequency) could be correlated to\nsoil compaction and underlying stiffness. Adam (1996) showed that the force\namplitude \u201cF\u201d of the drum blows is proportional to the first harmonic of the\nvertical acceleration, and the displacement \u201cs\u201d during the blow can be approx-\nimated by the amplitude of the double integral of the fundamental acceleration\ncomponent of the drum.\n\nIn this aim, Thurner and Sandstro?m (1980) proposed the compaction meter\nvalue (CMV) following Equation 2.1:\n\nCMV = C \u00b7\nA2?\nA?\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere A? is the acceleration amplitude of the fundamental component of the\nvibration; A2? is the acceleration amplitude of the first harmonic component\nof the vibration, i.e., twice the eccentric excitation frequency (fig. 2.3); C is a\nconstant established during site calibration (C = 300 is often used).\n\nFigure 2.3: Method to determine CMV involves spectral analysis (right) of two\ncycles of vertical drum acceleration time history data (left) (Mooney and Adam,\n2007)\n\nIt is known that the ratio of A2?/A? is a measure of nonlinearity (Ewins,\n2000; Mooney et al., 2005). Concerning to roller\u2013soil system if a roller with an\nexcitation frequency of 30 Hz produces a 30 Hz drum acceleration response, than\nin a truly linear system the ratio A2?/A? would be equal to zero. Since the drum\nacceleration response is distorted and not purely sinusoidal, therefore the roller\u2013\nsoil system is nonlinear. The non linear behaviour of the roller\u2013soil system can\nbe related to non linear elastic\u2013plastic soil behaviour, to partial loss of contact\noccurs between roller drum and soil and to contact surface varying nonlinearly\nduring each cycle of loading (Adam, 1996). Applying Fourier analysis it can\nbe reproduced a distorted waveform by summing multiples of the excitation\nfrequency. Therefore, the ratio A2?/A? is a measure of the degree of distortion\nor nonlinearity.\n\nPerforming spectral analysis of the measured vertical drum acceleration over\ntwo cycles of vibration allow CMV determination (fig. 2.3). The reported CMV\nis the average of a number of two\u2013cycle calculations. Geodynamik typically\naverages the values over 0.5 sec; however, this can be modified to meet the\nmanufacturer needs. CMV precision is governed by 1% distortion resolution\nof the accelerometer. Per Equation 2.1, 1% acceleration distortion equates to\nCMV = 3 or \u00b11.5. Geodynamik reports less reliability for CMV below 8\u201310\n(Mooney and Adam, 2007).\n\n\n\nCompaction equipments and technologies 11\n\nFormer empirical investigations have revealed that the amount of the first\nharmonic increases with increasing soil stiffness, which means that progress of\nCMV is significantly influenced by the operating conditions (Adam and Kopf,\n2000). Moreover, there is an auxiliary value that can be calculated in order to\ntake into consideration the operating conditions of the drum. This value is mea-\nsured continuously and presented in a form of a signal called RMV (Resonance\u2013\nMeter\u2013Value), which is defined by Equation 2.2:\n\nRMV =\nA0.5?\nA?\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere A0.5? is a subharmonic acceleration amplitude caused by jumping, i.e.,\nthe drum skips every other cycle.\n\nThe loading area from the cylindrical roller drum is a rectangular strip and\nthe size of this area depends on roller parameters like roller size, vibration am-\nplitude and frequency, forward velocity, soil type and stratigraphy underlying\nthe soil being compacted. Thus the relationship between CMV and soil density,\nstiffness and modulus is empirical and is influenced by these parameters (Sand-\nstro?m and Pettersson, 2004; Mooney et al., 2005). Hence, it is obvious that\nthe actual CMV will vary from roller to roller and that the roller parameters,\nespecially the frequency, have to be kept constant and equal to the parameters\nused during a calibration (Thurner and Sandstro?m, 2000). Therefore, the use of\nCMV in continuous compaction control (CCC) requires careful calibration. The\nassociated relationships developed during calibration must be strictly adhered\nto during subsequent site measurement (Mooney and Adam, 2007).\n\nSeveral rollers manufactures, like Dynapac, Caterpillar and Ingersoll Rand\n(via Geodynamik equipment) currently use CMV for roller monitoring. Sakai\nrecently introduced a Continuous Compaction Value (CCV) that, in addition\nto the fundamental and first harmonic, considers the first subharmonic (0.5?)\nand higher\u2013order harmonics, following Equation 2.3 (Nohse and Kitano, 2002).\n\nCCV =\n\n[\n\nA0.5? + A1.5? + A2.5? + A3?\nA2.5? + A3?\n\n]\n\n\u00d7 100 (2.3)\n\nDespite the fact that careful calibration should be done, using the roller\nas the measuring tool has great advantages, such as complete coverage of the\narea is obtained and that the result is received immediately. Figure 2.4 shows\nthe components of the compaction meter. An accelerometer is attached to the\nbearing plate of the roller drum in vertical direction. The acceleration signal is\nanalysed in the processor and the result is presented on a dial or display as the\nCMV.\n\nOmega value\n\nThe Omega value is provided by Terrameter system which was developed by\nBomag and Kro?ber (1988). The drum is fitted with a detector unit with two\nacceleration sensors arranged vertically which pick up the acceleration of the\ndrum. The CCC technique is based on the measure of the energy transmitted to\nthe soil (fig. 2.5). Considering the mass of the drum (md), the eccentric rotating\nmass (me), the static force (Fstat) and the eccentric force (Fe), the measurement\nof acceleration of the drum (z?d) and determination of drum velocity (z?d) by\n\n\n\n12 Compaction\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 2.4: (a) Compaction meter components; (b) Different means to display\nthe compaction result to the roller operator (Thurner and Sandstro?m, 2000)\n\nintegrating the acceleration components allows the determination of the Omega\nvalue (eq. 2.4). This is determined by integrating the transmitted force Fs and\ndrum displacement zd time history over two consecutive cycles of vibration.\n\nOmega =\n\n?\n\n2T\n\n(\n\n?mdz?d + (md + mf )g + mere?\n2\n)\n\nz?d dt (2.4)\n\nFigure 2.5: One\u2013degree\u2013of\u2013freedom lumped parameter model representation of\nvibratory compactor (Mooney and Adam, 2007)\n\nIn a electronic unit a computer stores the data transmitted by the detector\nunit and provide to the roller operator in an analogue display the Omega value,\nwhile compaction process is in progress. Omega values may range from 0 to\n1000, depending on status of compaction or stiffness and, for a certain measuring\ndistance, can be viewed after each pass in a line or bar chart. The measuring\nsystem also provides information to roller operator whether further effective\ncompaction passes are possible or not by means of two control lights on the\ncontrol unit. For this purpose, the mean Omega value of a forward (reverse)\npass is compared with the value of the previous forward (reverse) pass. The\nend of effective compaction work is indicated by a red control light which lights\nup when falling below a determined difference in values (Floss and Kloubert,\n2000).\n\nThe Omega value is influenced by machine specific parameters, which are\namplitude, frequency and working speed, as well as by soil specific parameters\nincluding those that describe stiffness, i.e., the strength and deformation char-\nacteristics, namely grain size distribution, plasticity, water content and density.\n\n\n\nCompaction equipments and technologies 13\n\nThe influence of subsoil should be considered for layers with less than 1.50 me-\nters (Floss and Kloubert, 2000).\n\nSoil stiffness ks\n\nIn the late 1990s, Ammann introduced a roller\u2013determined soil stiffness\nparameter, ks (Anderegg, 1998). A dynamic soil compactor produces nonlin-\near oscillations whose characteristics may be described analytically (Anderegg,\n2000). Accordingly to several authors, Yoo and Selig (1979), Pietzsch and Poppy\n(1992), Adam (1996), Anderegg and Kaufmann (2004) and Anderegg et al.\n(2006), among others, the vertical kinematics of the soil\u2013drum\u2013frame system\ncan be represented as a lumped parameter model, as illustrated in Figure 2.6.\n\nFigure 2.6: Analytical model of vertical vibration of a single drum roller (circular\nexcitation) (Anderegg et al., 2006)\n\nThe vibration roller can be subdivided into the frame and the drum. The\nframe, with mass mf , consists of the engine, the cabin and the drive which\nis supported in the drum via elastic suspension elements with stiffness, kf ,\nand damping constant, cf . Together with the rubber elements represents a\nsecond order lowpass with a natural frequency of 3 to 4 Hz, which dampens\nexcitation frequencies. The drum, with mass, md, contains an eccentric rotating\nunbalanced mass, me, which generates the drum vibrations together with the\nsoil at frequency, f. In analytical terms, the steady\u2013state dynamic behaviour of\nthe soil\u2013machine system is defined as in Equations 2.5 and 2.6 (Anderegg and\nKaufmann, 2004), where the soil is represented with a Kelvin\u2013Voigt spring\u2013\nviscous dashpot model.\n\nFs = ?mdz?d + mere?\n2cos(?t) + kt(zd ? zf ) + ct(z?f ? z?d) + mfg\n\n0 = ?mf z?f + kt(zd ? zf ) + ct(z?f ? z?d) + mfg\n(2.5)\n\nFs = kszd + csz? if Fs ? 0\nFs = 0 else\n\n(2.6)\n\nThe dot notation signifies the differentiation with respect to time and md\nis drum mass (kg), f is frequency of excitation (Hz), mf is frame mass (kg),\n\n\n\n14 Compaction\n\n? is circular vibration frequency (Hz), mere is eccentric moment of unbalanced\nmass (kg.m), zd is displacement of drum, ks is soil stiffness (MN/m), zf is\ndisplacement of frame, cs is soil damping (MN.s/m), kt is suspension stiffness\n(MN/m), ct is suspension damping (MN.s/m), t is time, and g is gravitational\nacceleration (9.81 m.s?2).\n\nAnderegg and Kaufmann (2004) proposed an approach wherein the soil stiff-\nness is solved for at the point where the drum is in its down\u2013most position\n(where zd = 0). This approach reduces the problem to a single variable and al-\nlows for a real time solution for ks. It also assumes that any effect on the drum\ndue to the frame inertia is negligible. Mooney and Rinehart (2007) states that\nwhile this assumption is satisfactory for single drum rollers where the ratio of\nthe drum mass to the frame mass is typically between 1.5 and 2, it is less valid\nfor tandem rollers, where the ratio of the drum mass to the frame mass can be\nlower. The equation for the soil\u2013drum interaction force (Fs) become defined as\nEquation in 2.7.\n\nFs = ?mdz?d + mere?\n2cos(?t) + kt(zd ? zf ) + mfg (2.7)\n\nThe drum inertia force and eccentric force time histories can be determined\nvia measurement of drum acceleration and phase angle ?, i.e., eccentric position.\nThe drum displacement amplitude zd is determined via spectral decomposition\nand integration of the measured peak drum accelerations (Anderegg and Kauf-\nmann, 2004). The resulting Fs versus zd response is graphically illustrated\nin Figure 2.7 for continuous contact and partial uplift behaviour. Solving the\nequation of motion for ks when the drum velocity is zero yields Equation 2.8.\n\nks = 2?\n2f2\n\n[\n\nmd +\nmerecos(?)\n\nzd\n\n]\n\n(2.8)\n\nFigure 2.7: Illustration of ks during contact (left) and partial loss of contact\nbehavior (right) (Mooney and Adam, 2007)\n\nWith this approach, the damping, cs, is eliminated from the calculation, and\na quasi\u2013static stiffness, ks, independent of the exciting frequency, is obtained.\nInvestigations performed by Anderegg and Kaufmann (2004) with a tandem\nroller vibrating on compacted subgrade with a constant static unbalanced mass,\nmere, and a variable excitation frequency f from 25 to 50 Hz, showed that the\nassociated stiffness, ks, is independent of frequency in that frequency range (fig.\n2.8). For highest frequencies the system started to become dependent on the\nmachine dynamics, and the measured stiffness values were higher than the static\nones because of the wave propagation effects.\n\n\n\nCompaction equipments and technologies 15\n\nFigure 2.8: Measurement of soil stiffness of homogeneous subsoil (Anderegg and\nKaufmann, 2004)\n\nEvib modulus\n\nEvib modulus is the more recent Bomag measurement value (Kro?ber and\nFloss, 2001). The principle is identical to the one described above for ks. A\nlumped parameter vibration and cylinder on elastic half\u2013space theory is used on\nits determination. The drum/soil assembly is modeled as shown previously in\nFigure 2.5. Similarly to Ammann technology, Bomag employs two accelerom-\neters to measure vertical drum acceleration (frame inertia is neglected) which\nenables to compute drum displacement. Phase angle (?) is calculated and en-\nables the determination of the contact force Fs per equilibrium of forces. The\ncombination of Fs and zd data yield contact force\u2013drum deflection curves from\nwhich secant stiffness can be extracted, as illustrated in Figure 2.9.\n\nFigure 2.9: Contact force\u2013drum displacement behaviour (Mooney and Adam,\n2007)\n\nThe relationship between the measured stiffness and vibration modulus Evib,\ncan be established through the application of Hertz and Lundberg\u2019s theoretical\nsolutions for a rigid cylinder resting on a homogeneous, isotropic elastic half\u2013\nspace (Lundberg, 1939). Investigations made by Hertz in 1895 and further\ndevelopments by Lundberg in 1939 gave the relationship between the load on a\nroller and the imprint area created by the roller. Lundberg\u2019s theory is a static\nsolution and relates zd, Fs, drum length L and diameter R to Poisson\u2019s ratio ?\nand Young\u2019s modulus E of the half\u2013space as shown in Equation 2.9.\n\nzd =\n2(1 ? ?2)\n\n?E\n\nFs\nL\n\n(\n\n1.8864 + ln\nL\n\nb\n\n)\n\nb =\n\n?\n\n16R(1 ? ?2)\n\n?EL\nFs\n\n(2.9)\n\n\n\n16 Compaction\n\nThe relationship between the stiffness ks and the modulus, E, can also be\nestablished on an experimental basis by performing the roller tests and plate\ntests in parallel. Ammann reports on a study from ETH Zurich in Switzerland\nwhich was conducted to establish such a relationship (Preisig et al., 2003). Fig-\nure 2.10 shows a relationship between the stiffness ks obtained from the roller\nand the moduli ME1 and ME2 from the first load and reload of the plate test.\nThe figure shows a reasonable relationship with some scatter.\n\nFigure 2.10: Stiffness (kB = ks) vs. Modulus (Preisig et al., 2003)\n\nComparison between CMV, Omega value, ks and Evib\n\nThrough numerical simulations of roller\u2013soil behavior using finite element\nanalysis of a roller vibrating on an elastic half-space Adam and Kopf (2004)\nexplored the influence of soil Youngs modulus on roller measurement values (E\nmodulus in Figure 2.11). The y\u2013axis in Figure 2.11 depicts the relative drum\nvibration amplitude, i.e., the ratio of zd to the theoretical maximum zd(max)\ngiven by the ratio between eccentric static moment (mere) and mass of the drum\n(md). In addition, zones corresponding to the drum operation under different\nconditions depending on roller and soil parameters are delimited (Adam, 1996).\nFive operating conditions specified in Figure 2.12 can occur; definition criteria\nare the contact condition between drum and soil and the drum motion cycle as\na multiple of the excitation cycle.\n\nIn Figure 2.11 one can see how relative amplitude and soil modulus influences\nthe behaviour of roller drum during compaction (contact modes). Focusing on\ncontinuous contact and partial uplift modes, CMV is very low and constant\nwhen the drum is operating in contact mode, regardless of soil modulus. CMV\nincreases as soil modulus increases during partial uplift, thus is sensitive to soil\nstiffness. However, CMV at a constant soil modulus is amplitude dependent;\ntherefore, a higher eccentric force will yield a greater CMV for the same soil.\nThe amplitude dependence of CMV is more pronounced for softer soils than for\nstiffer soils. The Omega value was found to be much less sensitive to underlying\nsoil stiffness for constant amplitudes and strongly amplitude dependent.\n\nParameter ks was found to increase with soil modulus and is amplitude\ndependent during partial uplift. It decreases with increasing amplitude during\n\n\n\nCompaction equipments and technologies 17\n\nFigure 2.11: Variation of roller measurement value with soil modulus and rel-\native drum vibration amplitude\u2013results of numerical simulations (Adam and\nKopf, 2004)\n\npartial uplift, particularly for stiffer soil. The amplitude\u2013dependence of soil\nstiffness was also demonstrated in field testing by Mooney and Rinehart (2007).\nSimilarly to ks, Evib is sensitive to changes in soil modulus during continuous\ncontact and partial uplift modes. An increase in soil modulus leads to an increase\nin Evib. Though Evib exhibits little or no amplitude dependence in continuous\ncontact mode, amplitude dependence increases with increasing amplitude during\npartial uplift. This amplitude dependence is more pronounced for stiffer soil.\n\nFrom Figure 2.11 one may conclude that all parameters exhibit amplitude de-\npendence at a constant soil modulus. Mooney and Rinehart (2007) investigated\nthe various roller parameters that determine the soil stiffness, namely drum ac-\nceleration and phase lag, as well as the influence of underlying heterogeneity on\nroller measured soil stiffness. The investigators found that roller determined soil\nstiffness was strongly dependent on vibration amplitude, and that underlying\nheterogeneity (e.g., near surface bedrock) presents a significant challenge to the\ninterpretation of data from roller\u2013integrated measurement systems.\n\n2.2.2 Intelligent compaction\n\nAs seen in previous section, compaction control could be included in the\ncompaction process through devices embarked on the rollers enabling continu-\nous monitoring and identification of soil properties, i.e. continuous compaction\n\n\n\n18 Compaction\n\nFigure 2.12: Operating conditions of a vibratory roller drum (Adam, 1996)\n\ncontrol (CCC). If, in addition, a feedback control of one or more of the fol-\nlowing: vibration frequency, force amplitude, and forward velocity is employed,\nthen compaction control could be done by compaction equipment itself and\noptimization of compaction could be achieved independently of equipment\u2019s op-\nerator. This is the basis of intelligent compaction.\n\nAnderegg and Kaufmann (2004) describes the technical conditions required\nfor intelligent compaction, which are shown in Figure 2.13. The vibration be-\nhavior of the drum-soil system is measured by using vertically fitted acceleration\nsensors; the phase lag between the excitation and the displacement of the drum\nis obtained from the measurement of the point when the exciter unit passes 0\nand the point when the measured and doubly integrated acceleration passes 0,\nthat is, the amplitude signal. The roller speed is also measured.\n\nThese data are forwarded to the electronic device, where the required vari-\nables (e.g., phase angle, soil force, and soil stiffness) are calculated, and the\ncommands to the final controlling elements (differential gear box and hydraulic\nvibration pump) are generated. When the instructions are executed, the control\nloop is closed, and the compactor becomes a closed feedback control system that\nis completely observable and completely controllable. In addition, the control\nsystem has an operating panel and a display that shows the machine operator\nthe compaction achieved and the optimum roller speed.\n\nThe limit of reasonable use of a vibratory roller is imposed by the nonlinearity\nbehaviour of the drum vibration, which is caused by periodic loss of contact\nfrom the soil with the inception of bouncing and rocking. Since nonlinearity\nis controlled by force, the concept control system is based on restriction of a\nmaximum force. The maximum soil reaction force is controlled to a value that\nguarantees the smooth entry of power into the soil, depending on the compaction\nmaterial and the layer thickness. In addition, an analysis of the state of motion\nensures that no subharmonic vibrations occur. Expressed in analytical terms,\nthe machine parameters are controlled according to (Anderegg and Kaufmann,\n2004):\n\n\n\nCompaction equipments and technologies 19\n\nFigure 2.13: Feedback control system for rollers with data (Anderegg and Kauf-\nmann, 2004)\n\n(i) the excitation frequency ? in such a way that ? = ?setpoint;\n140? &lt;?setpoint &lt;160\n\n?;\n\n(ii) the eccentric momentum of the unbalanced mass, mere in such a way that\nFs max = setpoint value (Fs max as per Equation 2.7);\n\n(iii) if subharmonic vibrations occur, mere is reduced immediately;\n\n(iv) the roller speed is optimal if the impact space is between 2 and 4 cm.\n\nHowever, roller\u2013measured soil stiffness has been found to vary with exci-\ntation force amplitude and frequency (Adam, 1996; Anderegg and Kaufmann,\n2004; Mooney and Rinehart, 2007). This behaviour is particularly pertinent\nregarding intelligent compaction since these parameters are continuously varied\nin an attempt to promote faster and more uniform compaction. To advance the\nunderstanding and capabilities of CCC in vertically homogeneous and layered\nearth structures as well as the measurement of soil properties during intelligent\ncompaction, the relationship between roller\u2013measured soil stiffness and in situ\nstress\u2013strain response was explored and characterized by Mooney and Rinehart\n(2009) and Rinehart and Mooney (2009).\n\nStress and strain sensors were placed at multiple depths within both ver-\ntically homogeneous (clayey sand) and heterogeneous (crushed rock over silt)\ntest beds. Triaxial stress\u2013strain behavior was captured during static and vibra-\ntory passes of two commercially available intelligent compactors over a range of\ntypical excitation force frequencies and amplitudes.\n\nMooney and Rinehart (2009) found roller\u2013measured stiffness to decrease\nwith increasing vibrating force for tests on the vertically homogeneous clayey\n\n\n\n20 Compaction\n\nsand. This behaviour was attributed to the stress\u2013dependent modulus reduc-\ntion observed in situ. On the crushed rock over silt layered test bed, roller\u2013\nmeasured stiffness increased with increasing vibrating force despite the mild\nstress\u2013dependent modulus reduction observed in the crushed rock. Authors ar-\ngues that the ratio of vertical stress in the crushed rock to vertical stress in\nthe underlying silt increased with vibrating force indicate that the crushed rock\ntoked on a greater portion of the load. Because the crushed rock was 4-5 times\nstiffer than the underlying silt, the composite roller\u2013measured stiffness increases\naccordingly.\n\nThe investigations carried out by Rinehart and Mooney (2009) showed that\nmeasured vertical stresses with depth matched well with those estimated using\nHertzian cylinder contact theory applied to a homogeneous, linear elastic half\nspace. One unique aspect of curved\u2013drum loading was that the contact area\nchanges as a function of applied force and stiffness of the soil. The contact\nwidth was found to strongly influence the resulting vertical stress profiles.\n\nFurther, both investigations showed that cyclic strains induced by drum vi-\nbration were only 15-25% of those induced by static loading. Authors pointed\nout this aspect because roller based stiffness measures are based on cyclic drum\ndeformation and the cyclic portion of strain is a reflection of the drum defor-\nmation used in the roller\u2013based stiffness calculation. These small magnitudes\nwere attributed to curved drum interaction with the soil and to viscoelasticity.\nDuring vibration, the drum/soil contact force equals the static force a cyclic\nforce that is a function of vibrating force and drum inertia. Contact stress and\ncontact area are non linearly related to force and vertical drum deflection, and\nlead to a hardening type relationship between applied force and drum deflection\nas depicted in Figure 2.14. The deflections (and in turn strains) due to drum\nvibration are smaller than the deflections resulting from static loading.\n\nTo sum up, roller\u2013measured stiffness and its dependence on vibrating force\nwas found to be influenced by the stress\u2013dependent modulus function of each\nsoil, the varying drum/soil contact area, and by layer characteristics modulus\nratio, thickness when layering is present. The interplay between these and\nother factors (e.g., dynamics, rate dependent response) will dictate the nature of\nroller\u2013measured stiffness dependence on vibrating force (Mooney and Rinehart,\n2009).\n\n2.3 Compaction control\n\nThe increasing requirements on quality construction in order to avoid over-\ncompaction and to minimize relative settlements of the embankment platform,\nas well as to minimize the exploration costs, demands higher quality on soil\ncompaction control. It is meant by compaction control the group of operations\ntaken over compacted layers with the purpose of guarantee that the character-\nistics assumed in project are being achieved in construction.\n\nIn project are considered several parameters values, such as, unit weight,\nshear strength, deformability and permeability. The compaction control should\nfocus on the distributions of values exhibited by each of these parameters. But\nhappens that the direct and individual control of these parameters requires\na lot of work and is time consuming, which is incompatible with the rhythm\nof construction. Therefore, the control is in general done by an indirect way,\n\n\n\nCompaction control 21\n\nFigure 2.14: Hardening response induced by the curved drum (Rinehart and\nMooney, 2009)\n\nthrough the control of certain characteristics that assure the compaction quality\nof embankments.\n\nAs already mentioned compaction of soil increases its density and produces\nthree important effects: (1) increase in the soil\u2019s shear strength, (2) decrease in\nfuture settlement of the soil, and (3) decrease in soil\u2019s permeability. Thus, soil\ndensity is one of the indirect parameters which allow the embankments quality\ncontrol. Even though soil density is not the most desired engineering property,\ntraditionally it is used by the transportation industry to specify, estimate, mea-\nsure, and control soil compaction. This practice was adopted many years ago\nbecause soil density can be easily determined via weight and volume measure-\nments. The most common methods used for density measurement are sand cone\nreplacement, water balloon and nuclear method.\n\nThe measurement of material density allows the determination of relative\ncompaction which is in fact the parameter used on compaction control. In first\nplace, optimum water content and the maximum dry unit weight (?max lab) are\ndetermined in the laboratory by either the standard or modified Proctor test.\nThen, target values are defined for compacted field dry unit weight (?d field).\nRelative compaction (RC) can be expressed as ?d field/?max lab. In most specifi-\ncations for earthwork, the contractor is required to achieve a relative compaction\nof 90 to 95%.\n\nAlthough referred compaction control parameters permits to determine if\nadequate compaction has been achieved, it does not allow controlling all the\ncharacteristic values normally considered in project. Therefore, it is current to\ndetermine the E modulus, which is an important design parameter for embank-\nments projected, for example, to transportation infrastructure, namely high\nspeed railways.\n\nFurther, high quality compaction involves not only a high degree but also a\nhigh uniformity of compaction. Experience and long\u2013term monitoring have dis-\nclosed that the mechanical behaviour, serviceability index and lifetime of a road\nor railway depend widely on the compaction degree and homogeneity/uniformity\nof the multi\u2013layered railway structure. The interactions were investigated in-\ntensively already 35 to 30 years ago and resulted in detailed recommendations\n\n\n\n22 Compaction\n\n(Brandl, 1977), including variation coefficient moduli from plate load tests (one\ntest for ? 200 m2) and for density measurements (replacement method \u2013 one\ntest for ? 300 m2, nuclear method \u2013 one test for ? 150 m2).\n\nTo sum up, traditionally, compaction is controlled by means of different\nspot test methods, used systematically or statistically, aimed at determining\nthe materials density or the E modulus of the layers in different spots. These\ncurrent quality control/quality assurance (Qc/Qa) methods are time consuming,\nlabor\u2013intensive and costly. For instance, the determination of density with the\nwater balloon method takes about 45 minutes excluding the time for weighing\nand drying the sample and the radiometric probe test takes about 5 to 15\nminutes, as a plate loading test takes at least 30 minutes, besides the need of\nheavy equipment to guarantee reaction force. The main reason for the adoption\nof such quality control methods is their relatively simplicity and can be applied\nto generate data for a statistical evaluation of compaction quality (Lenke et al.,\n2003).\n\nRecently, there is a strong trend towards using stiffness and strength to con-\ntrol compaction given the importance of these mechanistic properties in pave-\nment materials evaluation (Briaud, 2001; Loizos et al., 2003; Alshibli et al.,\n2005; Edil and Sawangsurya, 2005; Gomes Correia et al., 2009a). Mechanis-\ntic properties are a measure of quality since non\u2013uniformity of stiffness and/or\nstrength is directly related to progressive failures and life\u2013cycle cost. Moreover,\nthe design method of pavements is based on engineering parameters of materials\nsuch as their stiffness and/or strength, which results in a missing link between\nthe design process and construction quality control. As a result, the Qc/Qa\nprocedures of construction should be based on a criterion that closely correlates\nto the performance parameters used in the design.\n\nIncreasing demands for better, cheaper and faster compaction control have\nlead to technology improvements. In this context, equipments for field test eval-\nuation of mechanical properties of geomaterials have been recently developed,\nsuch as, impact tests (Falling Weight Deflectometer \u2013 FWD and Light Falling\nWeight Deflectometer \u2013 LFWD), the Soil Stiffness Gauge (SSG), Spectral Anal-\nysis of Surface Waves (SASW). These are non\u2013destructive spot tests which can\nbe conducted independently and in conjunction with conventional moisture den-\nsity testing improving statistical evaluation and allowing variability reduction,\nthus substantially enhance construction quality of the entire earthwork (Edil\nand Sawangsurya, 2005). Further, equipments enabling continuous evaluation\nof mechanical properties like Portanceme?tre had been developed, which repre-\nsents a great improvement on compaction control. However, these equipments\nare not normalized and its use demands calibration to reference test given in\ncompaction control specifications (Gomes Correia et al., 2009a). In this scope,\nin the following section are addressed specifications adopted by countries where\nhigh speed railways have been constructed. Further, the aforementioned devices\nwere used in the aim of the present thesis and, therefore, a detail review of each\none will be addressed.\n\n2.3.1 Specifications for high speed embankments and rail\ntrack layers\n\nThere are several aspects that governs high\u2013speed railway embankments and\ndistinguishes from other conventional transportation infrastructure, like road\n\n\n\nCompaction control 23\n\nembankments. High\u2013speed railway embankments demands an infrastructure\nexhibiting an overall stiffness that limits maximum settlements and minimize\nrelative settlements of the embankment platform during serviceability conditions\n(Martins et al., 2009), in order to minimize the exploration costs, to avoid high\nlevel of discomfort for passengers and reduce induced vibrations on surrounding\nstructures.\n\nThese aspects include strict requirements demands of high quality construc-\ntion of embankment and railtrack layers regarding material quality, state param-\neters and mechanical properties limits, promoting homogeneity of mechanical\nbehaviour of compacted layers. Requirements increase from bottom to top lay-\ners. The embankment layers should provide a stable foundation for the base\n(subballast) and ballast layers. The range of stiffness of the capping layers is\nbelieved to influence ballast, rail and sleeper deterioration, since the influence\nof the traffic induced stresses extends downwards as much as 5 meters below the\nbottom of the sleepers. Hence, embankment layers are a very important sub-\nstructure component which as a significant influence on track performance and\nmaintenance. Base layer (subballast) assumes great importance due to several\naspects, e.g., to ensure better distribution of loads, to protect the underlying\nlayer against erosion, to avoid seepage into the underlying layer and to prevent\nthe penetration of fine soil material into the track bed, especially to the ballast.\n\nIn the scope of the present work focus is given to requirements regarding\ncompaction control, namely, relative compaction and mechanical properties of\ncompacted layers. In Table 2.1 is summarized the requirements regarding com-\npaction control of embankment and railtrack layers in France and Taiwan, given\nby UIC (2004) and THSRP (2003), respectively.\n\nTable 2.1: High\u2013speed railway specifications (UIC, 2004; THSRP, 2003) regard-\ning relative compaction and mechanical properties of compacted layers\n\nLayer type THSRP (2003) UIC (2004)\n?d OPM ?

More-\nover, it is noteworthy that standards for determination of parameters also differ.\nNevertheless, determination of relative compaction is straightforward, while E\nmodulus determination following different standards yield differences either in\nthe procedure and on the interpretation of test results. Accordingly to informa-\ntion from National Railway Network (REFER), UIC (2004) is followed regarding\ncompaction control of new high\u2013speed railway lines. This code specifies SPLT\nperformance following French standard AFNOR NF P94\u2013117\u20131 (2000) and Ger-\nman standard DIN 18134 (2001) as reference test for determination of EV2. In\nthis scope, a better insight on these standards will aid on understanding the\nmajor aspects that distinguish them.\n\n\n\n24 Compaction\n\n2.3.2 Static plate loading test (SPLT)\n\nThe SPLT has been used for quality control of pavement structure layers for\nmany years in many European countries. This test method allows the determi-\nnation of the relationship between load and settlement (load\u2013settlement curve),\nthe aim being to assess the deformation and strength characteristics of soil and\nto determine the strain modulus.\n\nThe test consists of loading a circular plate on the top of the layer to be tested\nand measuring deflections under load increments. The load is transmitted to the\nplates by a hydraulic jack, acting against heavy mobile equipment as a reaction\nforce, while the corresponding deflection is measured. French standard AFNOR\nNF P94\u2013117\u20131 (2000) and German standard DIN 18134 (2001) are commonly\nused to perform SPLT.\n\nAFNOR NF P94\u2013117\u20131 (2000)\n\nThe test consists in the application, after a pre\u2013load, of two successive load-\ning cycles on a plate with normalized stiffness and diameter. For a 600 mm\ndiameter plate, the first load cycle should correspond to a 0.25 MPa stress un-\nder the plate and this stress maintained till the plate\u2019s settlement stabilization.\nFollowing, the load is release at once. In the second load cycle it should be\nreach a stress under the plate of 0.20 MPa. The load release should be done\nonly after the plate\u2019s settlement stabilization, as the first load cycle (fig. 2.15a).\nThe modulus, EV2, is calculated to the second loading cycle using Boussinesq\nsolution and secant method as in Equation 2.10.\n\nEV2 =\n?\n\n2\n\u00b7 (1 ? ?2) \u00b7\n\n? \u00b7 r\n\nz2\n(2.10)\n\nwhere ? is the Poisson\u2019s ratio, ? is the normal stress below the plate, r is the\nradius of the plate and z2 is the settlement of the plate during second load cycle.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 2.15: SPLT following AFNOR NF P94\u2013117\u20131 (2000) standard\n\nFor measuring the settlement of the loading plate two different systems can\nbe used. The first consists in a contact arm assembly which measures the\nsettlement of the center of loading plate. The second consists on the settlement\nmeasuring of three concentric points on periphery of the loading plate distanced\n\n\n\nCompaction control 25\n\nof 120? (fig. 2.15b). For both systems, the supports of the measuring devices\nshall be positioned so stands located 1.5 m from the center of the loading plate.\n\nDIN 18134 (2001)\n\nTo determine modulus, EV2, the load shall be applied in not less than six\nstages, in approximately equal increments, until the required maximum normal\nstress is reached. Each increase in load (from stage to stage) shall be completed\nwithin one minute. The load shall be released in stages, to 50% and 25% of\nthe maximum load and then to the load corresponding to the zero reading.\nFollowing that, a further (2nd) loading cycle shall be carried out, in which the\nload is increased only to the penultimate stage of the first cycle (fig. 2.16a).\n\nA 300, 600 or 762 mm loading plate can be used. To determine the modulus\nfor design calculations the load shall be increased until a settlement of 5, 8 or\n13 mm, or a normal stress below the plate of 0.50, 0.25 or 0.20 MPa, respectively,\nis reached. If the required settlement is reached first, the normal stress measured\nat this stage shall be taken as maximum stress. In the present work, it was used\na plate with 300 mm diameter. The strain modulus, EV2, is calculated to the\nsecond loading cycle using the tangent method as in Equation 2.11.\n\nEV2 =\n1.5 \u00b7 r\n\na1 + a2 \u00b7 ?0 max\n(2.11)\n\nwhere r is the radius, ?0 max is the maximum average normal stress below the\nplate and a1 and a2 are factors of the smooth load settlement curve correspond-\ning to the second load cycle.\n\nFor measuring the settlement of the loading plate a contact arm assembly\nshall be used and supports shall be located 1.5 m from the center of the loading\nplate (fig. 2.16b).\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 2.16: SPLT following DIN 18134 (2001) standard\n\n\n\n26 Compaction\n\n2.3.3 New techniques on spot tests method (SSG, FWD,\nLFWD, SASW)\n\nSoil Stiffness Gauge (SSG)\n\nThe SSG is manufactured by Humboldt Manufacturing Company and is a\nfield hand portable instrument that nondestructively measures soil stiffness and\nsoil modulus in a simple and rapid way (fig. 2.17). It is intended for the\nevaluation of compacted subgrade, subbase and base course layers, including\ntreated materials, for use in roadways and embankments.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 2.17: Humboldt Stiffness Gauge: (a) general aspect; (b) detail of ring\nshaped foot\n\nThe equipment weighs approximately 10 kg. It has a compact size of 28 cm\nin diameter by 25.4 cm in height. The device rests on the soil surface via a ring\u2013\nshaped foot, which has an outside diameter of 114 mm and an inside diameter\nof 89 mm (fig. 2.17). The foot bears directly on the soil and supports the weight\nof the SSG via several rubber isolators.\n\nA mechanical shaker, which is attached to the foot, excites the footing in\nthe vertical mode from 100 to 196 Hz in 4 Hz increments, producing 25 different\nfrequencies and generating a force of 9 N. The SSG has sensors that measure\nthe force, F , and the velocity, V , of the foot (see fig. 2.18). The magnitude\nof the vertical displacement induced at the soil\u2013ring interface is typically less\nthan 1.27\u00d710?6 m, which is measured using velocity sensors. A microprocessor\ncomputes the stiffness k (the layer\u2019s resistance to deflection) for each of the 25\nfrequencies, and the average value of the 25 measurements is displayed along\nwith a standard variation.\n\nThe force applied by the shaker and transferred to the ground is measured by\ndifferential displacement across the internal flexible plate as in Equation 2.12.\nAt the frequencies of operation, the ground\u2013input impedance will be dominantly\nstiffness controlled (Eq. 2.13). Thus, the ground stiffness is given by Equation\n2.14\n\nFdr = Kflex \u00b7 (X2 ? X1) + ?\n2 \u00b7 mint \u00b7 X1 (2.12)\n\nKgr =\nFdr\nX1\n\n(2.13)\n\n\n\nCompaction control 27\n\nFigure 2.18: Humboldt Stiffness Gauge (Humboldt, 2007)\n\nK?gr = Kflex \u00b7\n\n?n\n1\n\n(\n\nX2?X1\nX1\n\n)\n\nn\n+\n\n?n\n1 ?\n\n2\n\nn\n\u00b7 mint\n\n= Kflex \u00b7\n\n?n\n1\n\n(\n\nV2?V1\nV1\n\n)\n\nn\n+\n\n?n\n1 ?\n\n2\n\nn\n\u00b7 mint (2.14)\n\nwhere Fdr is the force applied by the shaker; Kflex is the stiffness of the flexible\nplate; X2 is the displacement at the flexible plate; X1 is the displacement at\nthe rigid foot; ? = 2?f, where f is frequency; mint is the mass of the internal\ncomponents attached to the rigid foot and of the foot; Kgr is the stiffness of the\nground, n is the number of test frequencies used in the SSG; V2 is the velocity\nat the flexible plate; V1 is the velocity at the rigid foot.\n\nThis approach avoids the need for a non\u2013moving reference for ground dis-\nplacement and permits the accurate measurement of small displacements. The\nmeasured soil stiffness from the SSG can, in turn, be used to calculate the soil\nmodulus of the underlying bound or unbound soil media. The applied force (F)\nand correspondent defection (?) are related with the outside radius of the ring\u2013\nshaped foot (r), Young\u2019s modulus (E) and Poisson\u2019s ratio of the tested material\nthrough as in Equation 2.15 (Poulos and Davis, 1974).\n\nF =\n1.77 \u00b7 r \u00b7 E\n\n(1 ? ?2)\n\u00b7 ? (2.15)\n\nConsidering that material\u2019s stiffness is given by Equation 2.16, the SSG\nstiffness k can then be converted to the soil elastic modulus ESSG using the\nEquation 2.17:\n\nk =\nF\n\n?\n(2.16)\n\nESSG =\nk \u00b7 (1 ? ?2)\n\n1.77 \u00b7 r\n(2.17)\n\nThese equations assume that the underlying soil is linear elastic, homoge-\nneous, and isotropic. They also assume an infinite half space. The assumptions\n\n\n\n28 Compaction\n\nof homogeneity, isotropy, and elasticity are frequently invoked in soil mechanics\nand pavement design when analyzing soil layers. However, the assumption of\nan infinite half space is arguably violated when one considers that underlying\npavement layers are generally of finite depth (on the order of 20 cm) and are\nof increasing modulus with depth. Hence, any computation of elastic modu-\nlus from the SSG measured stiffness must be carefully evaluated (Lenke et al.,\n2001).\n\nThe response is dominated by the stiffness of the underlying soil. The manu-\nfacturer specifies a range of stiffness measurement capability from 3 to 70 MN/m,\nwhich means an elastic modulus from 25 to 600 MPa. A depth of measurement\non the order of twice the foot outside diameter is produced (i.e., 23 cm).\n\nIn order to ensure good seating, Humboldt suggests that 60 percent of the\nSSG footprint be clearly visible after removing the SSG following a test on\nnatural material. In the case of very rough surfaces, a moist fine sand layer may\nbe placed as a coupling between the SSG foot and the soil.\n\nAlshibli et al. (2005) conducted a laboratory evaluation on different soil types\nusing both SSG and SPLT where values for the latter ranged from approximately\n0 to 500 MPa. Equation 2.18 describes the regression model obtained.\n\nEPLT(R) = 15.8 \u00b7 e\n0.011ESSG (R2 = 0.69) (2.18)\n\nFalling Weight Deflectometer (FWD)\n\nFalling weight deflectometers (FWDs) have been in use since the 1980s.\nThese devices are used to measure pavement deflections in response to a sta-\ntionary dynamic load corresponding to the effect of loading due to standard axle\non in\u2013service pavement.\n\nThere are several FWD manufacturers and, thereby, characteristics may\nslightly vary. In the scope of this thesis a Dynatest Model 8000E device was\nused. The FWD is mounted on a trailer (fig. 2.19a), that can be towed by\nmost conventional vehicles, where is mounted a load generating and a deflection\nmeasurement system. The control/recording system is housed in the towing\nvehicle.\n\nThe load generating system consists of a drop weight mounted on a vertical\nshaft, which is usually dropped onto a 305 mm or a 450 mm diameter loading\nplate. Both plates were used in the aim of the present work. The drop weight\nis hydraulically lifted to predetermined heights ranging from 50 to 510 mm and\nthe applied load ranges from 7 kN to 120 kN depending on the magnitude of the\ndropping mass and the height of the drop. The impact of the falling weight\nis capable of producing impact loads approximately halfsinusoidal wave, and a\nloading time between 25 and 40 ms applies impulse loading to a circular plate.\nThis is in contact with the pavement surface through a 5.6 mm thick rubber\nbuffer (fig. 2.19b), which is usually used to improve the uniformity of load-\ning stress distribution over the whole loading plate area. The applied load is\nrecorded by a load cell.\n\nThe deflection measuring system consists of 8 geophones positioned on the\npavements/layer surface at fixed distances from the center of the loading plate\n(fig. 2.19b). These geophones register the velocities due to an applied load and\ndeflections are computed by the software.\n\n\n\nCompaction control 29\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 2.19: FWD: (a) general view; (b) detail of geophones and plate\n\nThe FWD is used to establish elastic modulus values for the pavement layers.\nThe principle of the test is the measurement of the deflection bowl produced by\ndropping a weight onto the pavement.\n\nThe analysis of FWD results can be carried out in several ways. Back\u2013\ncalculation procedure is widely employed for analyzing deflection data from\nFWD (Lee, 1988). The analysis involves establishing a set of moduli values\nwhich would produce deflections to match the displacements recorded. These\ntheoretical deflections are compared with measured deflections and the assumed\nmoduli are then adjusted in an iterative procedure until there is no significant\ndifference between the theoretically calculated and the measured deflections.\nThe moduli determined in this method represent the pavement response to load\nand can be used to calculate stresses or strains in the pavement structure. An-\nother way consists on the interpretation of the results through spectral analysis\nof surface waves (Aouad et al., 2007). Then, a static approach can also be used\non the interpretation of FWD results. The measured center deflection of the\nplate is combined with the applied load to calculate the stiffness using conven-\ntional Boussinesq static analysis. This data is used to estimate the dynamic\ndeformation modulus, EFWD, following Equation 2.19.\n\nEFWD =\nkplate \u00b7 (1 ? ?\n\n2) \u00b7 ? \u00b7 r\n\n?c\n(2.19)\n\nwhere kplate = ?/2 or 2 for rigid and flexible plates, respectively; ?c is center\ndeflection of the plate; ? is the applied stress; and r is the radius of the plate.\n\nThe FWD provides periodic non\u2013destructive evaluation of the structural\ncapacity of different pavement sections. Due to its speed, better simulation of\ntraffic loading, and results that can directly be applied in structural design,\nit has been a good non\u2013destructive test for pavement structure assessment.\nAlthougth, less experience has been gained with the use of the FWD on road\nbases, subbases and subgrades (Gurp et al., 2000; Abu-Farsakh et al., 2003).\nCurrent FWD research, suggests that it can be used in quality control during\nconstruction of pavement layers (Zaghloul and Saeed, 1996; Rogers et al., 2000).\nNevertheless, it faces with some problems, such as tilting of the deflection sensors\ncaused by uneven surface, which in excess of a certain value leads to inaccurate\ndeflection measurements that can not be used in back calculation (Gurp et al.,\n2000).\n\n\n\n30 Compaction\n\nLight Falling Weight Deflectometer (LFWD)\n\nThe LFWD is a portable device used to determine the soil\u2019s dynamic modu-\nlus, ELFWD. It consists of a loading device that produces a defined load pulse, a\nloading plate and at least one geophone sensor to measure the deflection of the\ncenter of the plate. The LFWD dynamic modulus (ELFWD) is then calculated\nfrom the load pulse and deflection.\n\nThe equipment used in this study was a Prima 100 LFWD manufactured\nby Carl Bro Pavement Consultants. It weighs approximately 26 kg and has a\n10 kg falling mass that drops on the bearing plate via four rubber buffers. The\ncenter geophone sensor measures the deflection caused by the mass impact on\nthe loading plate. During the test, the falling mass impacts the plate, producing\na load pulse in the range of 1\u201315 kN in about 15\u201320ms. The diameter of the\nloading plate used in this study was 300 mm. Alternatively 100 and 200 mm\nplates are also available.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 2.20: (a) LFWD; (b) Components of the LFWD (Adam and Adam,\n2003)\n\nDuring testing with PRIMA 100, the load is applied to the layer surface via\nthe circular plate. The resulting force and velocity time histories are measured\nand the corresponding displacement time history is automatically obtained by\nmeans of integration (internal to the device) of the velocity record. The equip-\nment is connected to a computer equipped with software for recording, data\ninterpretation and visualization. The output includes respective time histories\nand peak values of the applied load, F(t), and ensuing deflection, ?(t), as well\nas an estimated value of ELFWD. A typical plot of the force and deflection time\nhistories data generated by PRIMA 100 is presented in Figure 2.21. Similarly\nto FWD, the same static approach can be used and Equation 2.19 is employed\nto the determination of ELFWD.\n\nFleming et al. (2007) point out one particularly important aspect when con-\nsidering the measurements made is the interpretation of the deflection under\nload. In general the device software integrates the geophone (velocity trans-\nducer) signal to determine the maximum (or peak) deflection value. This has\n\n\n\nCompaction control 31\n\nFigure 2.21: LFWD data collection screen\n\ntwo important ramifications, the first being that under test the peak deflec-\ntion may not occur at the same instant as the peak load, specifically for lower\nstiffness materials. The second is that the maximum deflection may include an\nelement of permanent/plastic deflection in addition to recoverable/elastic de-\nflection. This depends upon the \u201cstrength\u201d of the materials under test, and\nthe efficacy of the contact between the geophone foot and the material under\ntest. Thus it is apparent that the term \u201celastic\u201d stiffness should be applied very\ncarefully to this device, and the use of such \u201celastic\u201d values in elastic pavement\nanalysis needs careful consideration. In their investigations they found signifi-\ncant permanent deflection in loose and partly compacted sand, but no plastic\ndeformation was observed at compacted state.\n\nSeveral studies have been recently conducted to evaluate LFWD measure-\nments. The SPLT test is standardised and has been used for many years as a\nuseful in situ test to evaluate the strength/stiffness of pavement, thus is consid-\nered as a reference test.\n\nAlshibli et al. (2005) tested different types of soils with LFWD and SPLT in\na laboratory setting to evaluate their relation, where values of the latter ranged\napproximately from 0 to 700 MPa. The relation given in Equation 2.20 was\nobtained between EFWD and modulus from the reloading cycle of the SPLT\ntest, EPLT(R).\n\nEPLT(R) = 25.25 \u00b7 e\n0.006EFWD (R2 = 0.90) (2.20)\n\nFortunato (2005) performed 36 in situ tests with LFWD (300 mm diameter)\nand SPLT (600 mm diameter plate) during a geotechnical site investigation work\non the platform of the old railway of the Portugal North railway line. These\nwere carried out on different materials. The equipment and standards used were\nsimilar to those used in this study. The SPLT values of EV2 ranged from 36\nto 148 MPa, and relationships between moduli obtained by the two tests were\nestablished (Eqs. 2.21 or 2.22).\n\nELFWD = 1.13 \u00b7 Ev2\n0.98 (R2 = 0.74) (2.21)\n\nELFWD = 1.02 \u00b7 Ev2 (R\n2 = 0.68) (2.22)\n\n\n\n32 Compaction\n\nSpectral Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW)\n\nSASW is a widely used method for in situ testing that have been proposed\nand developed during the 1980s (Heisey et al., 1982; Nazarian, 1984; Stokoe\net al., 1988). It is a seismic method that use the propagation of elastic waves\nthrough materials at low deformation level, in the range of 10?5. At this defor-\nmation level it is possible to relate deformations and mechanic characteristics\nof materials using the theory of elasticity in linear system. The shear modulus\nobtained with these methods are considered as maximum values, G0.\n\nThere are two categories of seismic wave: volumetric waves and surface waves\n(fig. 2.22). Volumetric waves are of two types: P\u2013waves and S\u2013waves. P\u2013waves,\nalso known as primary, compressional or longitudinal waves, involve successive\ncompression and rarefaction of the materials through which they pass, i. e.,\nparticle moves in the direction of wave propagation (fig. 2.22a). This type of\nwaves can travel through solids and fluids. S\u2013waves, also known as secondary,\nshear or transverse waves, cause shear deformations as they travel through a\nmaterial, i. e., particle moves in a plane perpendicular to the direction of wave\npropagation. The direction of particle movement can be used to divide S\u2013waves\ninto two components. SV\u2013waves whose particle motion lies in a vertical plane,\nand SH\u2013waves whose particle motion occurs only in a horizontal plane. A given\nS\u2013wave with arbitrary particle motion can be represented as the vector sum of\nits SV and SH components. This type of wave can not travel through fluids\nsince they have no shearing stiffness.\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c) (d)\n\nFigure 2.22: (a) P\u2013waves; (b) Rayleigh waves; (c) S\u2013waves; (d) Love Waves\n\nSurface waves results from the interaction between volumetric waves with\nsurface and superficial layers, being created Rayleigh waves and Love waves,\nwhich propagation occurs at surface. Rayleigh waves, produced by interaction\nof P and SV\u2013waves with the surface, involve both vertical and horizontal par-\nticle motion, which can be assimilated to water waves occurring in the surface.\nParticle movement describes ellipses in a vertical plane, where the vertical axle\nis about one and a half the horizontal axle, which contains the propagation wave\ndirection, with displacement contrary to the propagation wave in the highest\npoint of the ellipses (fig. 2.22b). Love waves result from the interaction of SH\u2013\nwaves with a soft superficial layer than underlying half-space. Particles move\nhorizontally and transversally to direction of propagation (fig. 2.22d).\n\n\n\nCompaction control 33\n\nThe basis of the SASW technique is the dispersive property of Rayleigh\u2013type\nsurface waves when propagating in a layered system. Dispersion refers to the\nvariation of Rayleigh wave phase velocity with wavelength (or frequency). Dis-\npersion arises because Rayleigh waves of different wavelengths sample different\ndepths in a material profile as illustrated schematically in Figure 2.23. As wave-\nlength increases, particle motion extends to greater depths in the profile. The\nvelocities of Rayleigh waves, or surface waves, are representative of the material\nstiffness over depths where there is significant particle motion. For example,\nthe particle motion of a wave that has a wavelength less than the thickness of\nthe top layer is confined to this layer (fig. 2.23). Therefore, the wave velocity is\ninfluenced only by the stiffness of the top layer. The velocity of a wave with a\nwavelength that is longer than the thickness of the top layer, but shorter than\nthe combined thicknesses of the top two layers, is influenced by the properties of\nonly the upper two layers because essentially all motion occurs in these layers.\nThus, by using surface waves with a range of wavelengths, it is possible to assess\nmaterial properties over a range of depths.\n\nFigure 2.23: Approximate distribution of vertical particle motions with depth\nof two surface waves of different wavelengths (Rix and Stokoe, 1989)\n\nSASW testing can be synthesised in three different steps that lead to the final\nresult of a stiffness profile for the site: field testing, dispersion curve evaluation\nand inversion process.\n\nField testing consists of making field measurements of surface wave phase\nvelocity, VR, at numerous wavelengths, ?R. To ensure the adequate application\nof SASW test it is necessary to take into account the energy source and receivers,\nconsidering the desirable frequency range, the space between receivers and the\nrange of exciting frequency for each space adopted.\n\nThe energy source that generates surface waves is, normally, mechanical (im-\npact) or electromechanical (continuous) sources that apply dynamical vertical\nloads to the surface. The impact sources correspond to loads generated by an\nimpulse, as the ones proportioned by hand hammers or weights that falls from\na determined high. Normally, as heavy is the impact source, the lower is the\ngenerated frequency. However, the same source does not generate the same fre-\nquencies in every medium. There are other factors which controls the generated\nfrequency domain, namely the stiffness of the material and the interface between\n\n\n\n34 Compaction\n\nthe source and material to analyse. In general terms, for characterization of su-\nperficial layers is used a light hand hammer, being used a heavy one when higher\ndepth is of interest. Regarding continuous sources, electromechanical ones are\ngenerally used producing sinusoidal vibrations with a range of frequencies. This\nallows to control vibration frequency and to set a range of frequencies. Another\nway to obtain continuous signs is to operate heavy equipment near receivers.\nThe signs produced are random and normally has a sign-to-noise ratio rela-\ntively low. At sites where there are no surface area limitations, the primary\nconsideration in selecting an energy source is the required depth of profiling.\nDeep profiling requires a high\u2013energy, low\u2013frequency wave source, while shallow\nprofiling can be done with a low\u2013energy, high\u2013frequency wave source.\n\nIn general, the receivers used in this tests are geophones (velocity transduc-\ners) and accelerometers (acceleration transducers), of low frequency and high\nsensibility, since induced displacements are usually small. The receivers are\nplaced in vertical and aligned relative to energy source. The selection of type\nof receiver and its spacing depends mostly of the frequency domain used on the\ntest. In order to minimize the effects of proximity of the source, mainly related\nto body waves and aliasing phenomenon in spectral analysis it is necessary to\nimpose limitations to the distance between energy source and receivers, L, and\nreceivers spacing, d. Tokimatsu et al. (1991) proposed the positioning of the\nreceivers in such a way that:\n\nL >\n?\n\n4\n(2.23)\n\n?\n\n16\n? d &lt;? (2.24)\n\nThe general field configuration of the source, receivers, and recording equip-\nment typically used when testing with two receivers is shown in Figure 2.24.\nThe propagation of waves along the surface is monitored with the two receivers\nplaced at distances of d1 and d2 from the source. Additionally, distance d2 is\nusually kept equal to two times d1. Typical receiver spacings for deep profiling\nare 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 m. These spacings allow evaluation of most soil profiles\nto a depth of 50 to 70 m.\n\nFigure 2.24: Traditional configuration of equipment used in SASW testing with\na two\u2013channel recording system (Stokoe et al., 1994)\n\n\n\nCompaction control 35\n\nAfter the field data are recorded, a dispersion curve is calculated. For test-\ning with multiple receivers, receiver pairs are used to determine the dispersion\ncurve. For each receiver pair, the time histories recorded by the two receivers\nare transformed to the frequency domain, and the cross power spectrum and\ncoherence function are calculated. It should be noted that all of these frequency\ndomain quantities are calculated in real time by the waveform analyzer. The\nkey data consist of the phase of the cross power spectrum and the coherence\nfunction. The coherence function represents a signal\u2013to\u2013noise ratio and is often\nclose to one in the range of acceptable data. The time delay between receivers\nas a function of frequency, t(f), is calculated from the phase of the cross power\nspectrum. The surface wave velocity, VR, is calculated using Equation 2.25.\nThe corresponding wavelength of the surface wave, ?R, with a given frequency,\nf, is calculated by Equation 2.26.\n\nVR =\nd2 ? d1\nt(f)\n\n(2.25)\n\n?R =\nVR\nf\n\n(2.26)\n\nThe result of these calculations is a dispersion curve (VR versus ?R) for\neach receiver pair. For the traditional two\u2013channel SASW testing illustrated\nin Figure 2.24, individual dispersion curves from a group of receiver spacings\nare assembled together to form the composite dispersion curve for the site. An\nexample of a composite dispersion curve is presented in Figure 2.25 using eight\ndifferent receiver spacings as noted in the figure. In the scope of the present work\nexperimental dispersion curve was computed using software SPICE developed\nin KU Leuven (Schevenels and Geert Degrande, 2009).\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 2.25: (a) Composite experimental dispersion curve from traditional\nSASW testing at soil site; (b) Comparison between experimental and theor-\nical dispersion curves for a soil site Stokoe et al. (1994)\n\nAfter a dispersion curve is calculated from the field data, forward modeling\nis used in the laboratory to evaluate the shear wave velocity profile. Forward\nmodeling is the process of calculating the shear wave velocity profile by a trial\u2013\nand\u2013error matching of a theoretical dispersion curve with the measured field\ndispersion curve. In this process, the theoretical dispersion curve is calculated\n\n\n\n36 Compaction\n\nfor an assumed velocity profile. This velocity profile should contain a sufficiently\nlarge number of sublayers to define the variation of material properties at the\nsite. The shear wave velocities and thicknesses of the sublayers in the assumed\nprofile are adjusted by trial and error until a satisfactory match between the\ntheoretical and field dispersion curves is obtained. Such a match is illustrated\nin Figure 2.25b for the smoothened composite dispersion curve developed from\nthe data shown in Figure 2.25a. The resulting shear wave velocity profile is\nshown in Figure 2.26, along with results from crosshole tests also performed at\nthe site (Stokoe et al., 1994).\n\nFigure 2.26: Shear wave velocity profiles determined from SASW (using data\nshown in fig. 2.25) and crosshole tests at the same site Stokoe et al. (1994)\n\nAccording to the theory of elasticity, the relationship between the velocity\nof shear waves, Vs, and the velocity of Rayleigh waves, VR, in a uniform is given\nby Equation 2.27.\n\nVs ? C \u00b7 VR (2.27)\n\nThe constant C is dependent on the Poisson\u2019s ratio. For values of this\ncoefficient of 0.2 and 0.5, C assumes values of 1.09 and 1.05, respectively, which\nmeans that the error in evaluating the Poisson\u2019s ratio little affect the value of\nVs. The value of the shear modulus, G, is determined from values measured\nof velocity of Rayleigh waves and the density of material, ?, by the theory of\nelasticity, given by Equation 2.28. This way it is possible to convert the vertical\nprofile of velocities in a profile of values of shear modulus.\n\nG = ? \u00b7 V 2s (2.28)\n\n2.3.4 Continuous test method (Portanceme?tre)\n\nHitherto, compaction control has been carried out mainly by means of spot\ntest methods with the purpose to check the density, stiffness or modulus of the\ncompacted layer. Compaction result is checked by means of some spot test\nmethod can never reliably represent the compaction result of the entire area,\nnor contribute to an improvement of the homogeneity of the compaction work.\nAccording to national compaction standards in different countries one sample\nis taken on 2.000 m3 of compacted soil, which means a relation between sample\n\n\n\nCompaction control 37\n\nvolume and compacted volume of 1:1.000.000. Such quality control relation\nprobably is very hard to find elsewhere (Thurner and Sandstro?m, 2000).\n\nMost of spot test methods are time consuming and will in addition delay or\nstop construction work, because the tests have to be carried out without any\ndisturbing vibrations around the test spot. Moreover, traditionally, soil and\nrock fill materials are compacted with static or vibrating rollers. As mentioned\nbefore, compaction parameters of the roller are chosen by operator and kept\nconstant, which do not necessarily lead to a homogeneous compaction result\non a layer. Therefore compaction control by mean of spot test methods will\never be able to meet modern requirements on a homogeneous compaction result\n(Thurner and Sandstro?m, 2000).\n\nRegarding high quality projects as high speed railways, where rigorous de-\nformation criteria of the structure soil\u2013railtrack must be satisfied, continuous\ncompaction control represents an improvement fairly to compaction control by\nmean of spot test methods. As has been noted in section 2.2.1, CCC may be\nachieved by instrumented rollers. However, there is an equipment named, Por-\ntanceme?tre, which operates similarly to instrumented rollers. This equipment\nperforms continuous compaction control by measuring bearing capacity through\nan instrumented vibrating wheel.\n\nThe Portanceme?tre is an equipment developed by the \u201cCenter d\u2019E?tudes Tech-\nniques de l\u2019E?quipment\u201d (CETE) in France. It measures the bearing capacity of\na platform continuously while rolling to a constant speed. The device consists\non a narrow vibrating wheel with suitable characteristics towed by a 4x4 vehicle\n(fig. 2.27). This wheel is set into vibration by way of an eccentric mass activated\nby a hydraulic engine.\n\nThe principle of measure is based on the determination of the curve: force\ncommunicated by the vibrating wheel versus deflection, allowing the determi-\nnation of stiffness of geomaterials and to calculate its modulus. This equipment\napplies a load, at a 35 Hz frequency, to the soil trough a vibration wheel while\nrolling to a speed of 1 m/s. The instrumentation installed on the equipment\npermits to measure the vertical component of acceleration of the vibration and\nsuspended masses, and the vibration frequency and the phase angle between the\nvibration vertical amplitude and the centrifugal force applied to the wheel (fig.\n2.27c). An algorithm associated calculates the vertical force applied to the soil\nand the corresponding deflection.\n\nThe vertical component of the applied force by the vibration wheel (FTA)\nis calculated by the following expression (Quibel, 1999):\n\nFTA = M1 \u00b7 g + M0 \u00b7 ?V 1 + (M1 ? M0) \u00b7 ?V 2 + me \u00b7 ?\n2 \u00b7 cos? (2.29)\n\nwhere M1 \u00b7 g is the total weight; M0 \u00b7 ?V 1 is the inertial force of the vibrating\nmass with ?V 1 being the vertical acceleration measured by means of a single\naxial accelerometer; (M1 ? M0) \u00b7 ?V 2 is the inertial force of the frame with\n?V 2 being the vertical acceleration of the suspended mass; me \u00b7 ?\n\n2 \u00b7 cos? is the\nvertical component of the centrifugal force produced by the eccentric mass.\n\nThe vertical movement of the vibration wheel is determined by a double\nintegration of the signal of the vertical acceleration. The average of the measured\nvalues, of the force and deflection, in thirty successive periods, permits to get the\n\n\n\n38 Compaction\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\nFigure 2.27: Portanceme?tre equipment: (a) general aspect; (b) vibrating wheel\ndetail; (c) function schema\n\nforce\u2013deflection curve of which the upward part is treated by linear regression in\nthe zone 30% to 90% of the vertical maximum force (FTA) applied to determine\nthe stiffness. With a vibration frequency 35 Hz and a travelling speed 1 m/s, the\nPortanceme?tre device provides a value of modulus for each meter length (fig.\n2.28).\n\nThe traveling speed of the whole is measured by means of ultrasonic radar\nDoppler that also allows to determine the covered distance and therefore to\nsituate the measure in the longitudinal profile.\n\nSome conditions must be guaranteed to allow the application of Portanceme?-\ntre. Relatively to the layer geometry, the measurements are valid when longi-\ntudinal and transversal inclinations are lower than 7 and 5%, respectively. In\nrespect to mechanical properties, loose materials with low shear strength on\nsurface must be considered out of the domain of the equipment. This situation\nis verified when observed a rut let by the passage of the vibrating wheel with\nmore than 2 cm.\n\nSeveral tests performed with Portanceme?tre on structures constructed with\ndifferent materials (aggregates, soils and treated materials), enabling a varia-\ntion of the EV2 modulus, determined by means of the static plate test (600 mm\ndiameter), from 20 to 500 MPa, showed a very good correlation between mea-\nsures of stiffness with the Portanceme?tre and values of modulus determined by\ndynaplaque 2 or by the classic test (EV2) (Quibel, 1999):\n\nE = 5 \u00b7 k (2.30)\n\nE being expressed in MPa and k in kN/mm.\n\nOther experimental results (Quibel, 1999) allow the application domain of\nthe Portanceme?tre device to be composed by bottom of cuttings, layers and\nupper parts of embankments and sub-grades, with elastic modulus in the range\nof 30 to 300 MPa. The material thickness taken in account was about 0.60 m.\n\nFortunato (2005) conducted two series of SPLT (600 mm diameter plate)\ntests, one of 22 tests and another of 11 tests, and Portanceme?tre passages on\na sub\u2013ballast layer and comparison between moduli was established. From\nfirst series the author reported that modulus from 14 SPLT tests differed less\nthan 25% from modulus obtained from Portanceme?tre. Regading second series,\naverage difference between moduli was found to be 9% with a maximum relative\ndifference not exceeding 27%.\n\n\n\nSummary 39\n\nFigure 2.28: Display of the monitor (Quibel, 2006)\n\n2.4 Summary\n\nCompaction has a major influence on mechanical behaviour of compacted\ngeomaterials. Compaction leads to a decrease of void ratio, which, in turn,\nimproves their performance regarding shear strength, deformability and per-\nmeability. Hence, compaction assumes a critical role in the construction of\ntransportation infrastructure (highways, railways, airports, etc.) and energy\ninfrastructures (earth dams).\n\nIn general, geomaterials are compacted with static or vibrating rollers. Re-\ncently there has been an increasing interest in vibration\u2013based monitoring of\nroller compactors to provide continuous assessment of the soil mechanistic prop-\nerties, namely stiffness and/or modulus, during compaction process. With this\naim, devices are embarked on compactors and roller\u2013based measures of soil com-\npaction are determined, e.g. relative indices or soil stiffness. As so, instantly and\ncontinuously relative information allows the roller operator to evaluate where\ncompaction work is finished, where additional passes are required and what\nsections cannot be sufficiently compacted with the present roller and, on the\nother hand, allows to get an indication concerning the bearing capacity of a\nlayer at the end of compaction. In this scope, the various roller\u2013determined dy-\nnamic measurement values in use today, namely compactor meter value (CMV),\nOmega value, roller\u2013determined stiffness (ks) and vibration modulus (Evib) were\npresented.\n\nIf feedback control is employed on compactors, then so called intelligent com-\npaction is achieved. Intelligent compaction technology results from the combi-\nnation of the absolute measurement technology with a control system that uses\nthe measured information to continuously adapt major control parameters of a\nvibratory roller, namely, the amplitude, the frequency and the roller velocity,\nto the required conditions.\n\nThe increasing requirements on quality construction in order to avoid over-\n\n\n\n40 Compaction\n\ncompaction and to minimize relative settlements of the embankment platform,\nas well as to minimize the exploration costs, demands higher quality on soil\ncompaction control.\n\nRecently, there is a strong trend towards using stiffness and strength to con-\ntrol compaction given the importance of these mechanistic properties in pave-\nment materials evaluation (Briaud, 2001; Loizos et al., 2003; Alshibli et al.,\n2005; Edil and Sawangsurya, 2005). Mechanistic properties are a measure of\nquality since non\u2013uniformity of stiffness and/or strength is directly related to\nprogressive failures and life\u2013cycle cost. Moreover, the design method of pave-\nments is based on engineering parameters of materials such as their stiffness\nand/or strength, which results in a missing link between the design process and\nconstruction quality control.\n\nIncreasing demands for better, cheaper and faster compaction control have\nlead to technology improvements. In this context, equipments for field test eval-\nuation of mechanical properties of geomaterials have been recently developed,\nsuch as, impact tests (Falling Weight Deflectometer \u2013 FWD and Light Falling\nWeight Deflectometer \u2013 LFWD), the Soil Stiffness Gauge (SSG), Spectral Anal-\nysis of Surface Waves (SASW). These are non\u2013destructive spot tests which can\nbe conducted independently and in conjunction with conventional moisture den-\nsity testing improving statistical evaluation and allowing variability reduction,\nthus substantially enhance construction quality of the entire earthwork (Edil\nand Sawangsurya, 2005). These equipments were used in the aim of the present\nthesis and, therefore, a detail review of each one was addressed in this chapter.\nFurther, equipments enabling continuous evaluation of mechanical properties\nlike Portanceme?tre had been developed and was also used in the present study.\nThus, a detail review was also presented.\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe influence of compaction\non the hydro\u2013mechanical\nbehaviour of geomaterials\n\n3.1 Introduction\n\nCompacted geomaterials find their most important applications in geotech-\nnical civil engineering projects. Examples can be found in earth dams and\ntransportation projects, such as road, railways and airport embankments.\n\nRailways embankments and railtrack layers are constructed on compacted\ngeomaterials that are typically in unsaturated condition during construction and\nmay remain in that condition during the working life of the structure. Several\ndesign and maintenance measures are undertaken to maintain unsaturated con-\nditions because they provide favorable engineering materials properties, namely\nshear strength and deformability.\n\nIn practice, pavement design is based on rational methods using Young mod-\nulus (E) and Poisson\u2019s ratio (?). These parameters are generally determined in\nterms of total stresses, even though materials used in railways construction are\nnot completely saturated or completely dry. This approach is conservative to\nvarying degrees to that the influence of soil suction is ignored. For this reason,\nthe behaviour of unsaturated materials is of utmost importance.\n\nThe mechanical aspects of saturated geomaterials are governed by the Terza-\nghi\u2019s effective stress. When a soil mass is loaded, it deforms and then a counter\nforce is generated so as to balance the load. Although soil consists of a soil\nskeleton and pore fluid, the latter does not play a principal role in the shear\nbehaviour, that is, the pore fluid does not resist the shear force. The pore water\nmigrates within the soil skeleton subjected to hydraulic boundary conditions.\nHowever, on unsaturated geomaterials the pore space is occupied by both air\nand water, where suction play a fundamental role on the hydro\u2013mechanical as-\npects. Unsaturated soil behaviour consists of hydraulic part dealing with the\nsuction-saturation relation and a mechanical part dealing with the stress-strain\nrelation. In turn, the hydro\u2013mechanical behaviour is influenced by compaction\nconditions.\n\n41\n\n\n\n42 The influence of compaction on the hydro\u2013mechanical behaviour\n\nIn what follows basic concepts on unsaturated geomaterials will be pre-\nsented. Then, the influence of compaction conditions on the hydro\u2013mechanical\nbehaviour of either saturated and unsaturated geomaterials will be addressed.\n\n3.2 Basic concepts of non saturated geomateri-\nals\n\n3.2.1 Suction\n\nSoil suction is defined as the potential difference between the soil pore water\nand water outside the soil pores, per volume of water and is also referred to as\nfree energy state of soil water (Fredlund and Rahardjo, 1993). The free energy of\nthe soil water can be measured in terms of the partial vapor pressure of the soil\nwater (Richards, 1965) and its thermodynamic relationship can be expressed in\nterms of relative humidity as follows:\n\n? = ?\nR \u00b7 T\n\nm \u00b7 g\n\u00b7 ln\n\n(\n\nP\n\nP0\n\n)\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere ? is soil suction or total suction, R is the universal gas constant, T is the\nabsolute temperature, g is the gravitational constant, P/P0 is relative humidity\nin percent where P is the partial pressure of pore water vapor pressure (kPa)\nand P0 is the saturation pressure of water vapor over a flat surface of pure water\nat the same temperature (kPa).\n\nThe total suction (free energy) of soil is divided into two components, osmotic\nand matric suction. Osmotic component is defined as \u201cthe equivalent suction\nderived from the measurement of the partial pressure of the water vapor in\nequilibrium with a solution identical in composition with the soil water, relative\nto the partial pressure of water vapor in equilibrium with free pure water\u201d\n(Fredlund and Rahardjo, 1993). In other words, the osmotic component of soil\nsuction arises from the chemical interactions between dissolved salts and free\nwater (defined as water containing no dissolved solutes).\n\nThe second component of soil suction is the matric suction. It is defined as\n\u201cthe equivalent suction derived from the measurement of the partial pressure of\nthe water vapor in equilibrium with the soil water, relative to the partial pressure\nof the water vapor in equilibrium with a solution identical in composition with\nthe soil water\u201d (Fredlund and Rahardjo, 1993). In unsaturated soil mechanics\nmatric suction is defined as the difference between the pore air pressure and\npore water pressure (\u00b5a ? \u00b5w). This component is commonly associated with\ncapillary phenomena arising from surface tension of water, which results from\nintermolecular forces acting on molecules in the contractile skin.\n\nCapillary phenomena is best understood through the classic example of water\nrising and remaining above the line of atmospheric pressure within a small\ndiameter tube. The surface of the water in the capillary tube is curved and is\ncalled a meniscus, as illustrated in Figure 3.1. The height of capillary rise is\na function of the tube diameter, contact angle between the tube and wetting\nliquid. The mathematical relationship is shown below:\n\nhc =\n2 \u00b7 T\n\n? \u00b7 r\n\u00b7 cos? (3.2)\n\n\n\nBasic concepts of non saturated geomaterials 43\n\nwhere T is the surface tension of the fluid (water for this discussion), r is the\nradius of the capillary tube, ? is the unit weight of water, and ? is the contact\nangle between the water and capillary tube. Assuming a clean glass tube and\npure water (contact angle ? becomes 0), equation 3.2 reduces to the following:\n\nhc =\n2 \u00b7 T\n\n? \u00b7 r\n(3.3)\n\nFigure 3.1: Physical model and phenomenon related to capillarity (Fredlund\nand Rahardjo, 1993)\n\nSetting the hydrostatic equilibrium in the capillary system shown in Figure\n3.1, matric suction can be deduced and expressed as follows:\n\n(\u00b5a ? \u00b5w) =\n2 \u00b7 T\n\nr\n\u00b7 cos(?) (3.4)\n\nFrom Figure 3.2 it can be seen that soil particles similar to the walls of the\ncapillary tube and the surface tension contractile skin (air\u2013water interface) holds\nboth the water intact and the two soil particles together. Considering that the\ngeomaterials pores with small radii act as capillary tubes, Equation 3.3 shows\nthat the smaller the pore radius in the soil, the higher will be matric suction\nand, therefore, shear strength of unsaturated geomaterials will increase.\n\nIn most engineering problems it is primarily the matric suction component\nwhich largely governs the behaviour of unsaturated soils (such as mechanical\nproblems) in the lower suction range encountered in most field situations (Vana-\npalli et al., 1996).\n\nSeveral measurement techniques are available to measure the suction of a\nsoil sample. A comprehensive description of the experimental techniques com-\nmonly used for measuring or controlling soil suctions can be found in Fredlund\nand Rahardjo (1993). The method selected should depend upon the suction\ndesired. Measurement techniques, such as tensiometers (Delage et al., 2008),\npsychrometers (Delage et al., 2008), pressure plates (Richards, 1941), and filter\npaper method (Chandler et al., 1992; Marinho and Oliveira, 2006), are used\n\n\n\n44 The influence of compaction on the hydro\u2013mechanical behaviour\n\nFigure 3.2: Capillary tubes showing the air\u2013water interfaces at different radii of\ncurvature (Fredlund and Rahardjo, 1993)\n\ncovering a wide range of suction measurement. Only filter paper method will\nbe described, since it was the only method employed in the aim of this research.\n\nThis method was selected because it is capable of measuring a wide range\nof matric suctions (i.e., from 10 kPa to 10 MPa), it is relatively simple and\ncost efficient method, and it has been widely used in geotechnical engineering\npractice (Chandler et al., 1992; Fredlund and Rahardjo, 1993; Likos and Lu,\n2002; Marinho and Oliveira, 2006; Bicalho et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2008)\n\nThe filter paper method operates on the premise of determining suction of\nunsaturated soils indirectly by measuring the amount of moisture transferred\nfrom soil mass to dry filter papers. It calculates the soil suction indirectly from\nprevious calibration. Basically, the filter paper comes to equilibrium with the\nsoil either through vapour (total suction measurement) or liquid (matric suction\nmeasurement) flow. At equilibrium, the filter paper and the soil will have the\nsame suction value. After equilibrium is established between the filter paper\nand the soil, the gravimetric water content of the filter paper disc is measured.\nThe gravimetric water content of filter paper is then converted to suction using\na calibration curve for the type of paper used.\n\nTwo filter paper methods exist depending upon if the total or matric suction\nis to be determined. If total soil suction is desired the non\u2013contact method\nshould be used, while the contact method allows determination of matric suc-\ntion. Figure 3.3 illustrates the testing setups for total and matric suction mea-\nsurement. In the contact filter paper technique, water content of an initially\ndry filter paper increases due to a flow of water in liquid form from the soil to\nthe filter paper until both come into equilibrium. Therefore, a good contact be-\ntween the filter paper and the soil has to be established. The contact filter paper\nmethod becomes inaccurate in high matric suction range since water transport\nis dominated by vapour transport.\n\nThe water content measure is correlated to a calibration curve unique for\nthe filter paper used, and the suction, matric or total, is able to be determined\ndepending upon the calibration curve selected. In the present work ash\u2013less\nfilter papers Whatman 42 was used. In Table 3.1 are listed some published\n\n\n\nBasic concepts of non saturated geomaterials 45\n\nFigure 3.3: Filter paper method for measuring total and matric suction (Yang\net al., 2008)\n\ncalibration curves for this filter paper (Bicalho et al., 2008).

The relationship between water content and suction can be\nempirically described by the soil water characteristic curve (SWCC) (Fredlund\nand Rahardjo, 1993; Tinjum et al., 1997; Vanapalli et al., 1999; Marinho and\nStuermer, 2000; Bardanis and Kavvadas, 2008), also known as soil water reten-\ntion curve (WRC) (Karube and Kawai, 2001; Aubertin et al., 2003; Nuth and\nLalouia, 2008), which is defined as the water storage capacity of a soil at a given\nsoil suction. The water content variable can be a gravimetric water content, w,\nor a volumetric water content, ?, or degree of saturation, S. A typical WRC is\nillustrated in Figure 3.4.\n\n\n\n46 The influence of compaction on the hydro\u2013mechanical behaviour\n\nFigure 3.4: Typical WRC (Vanapalli et al., 1996)\n\nThe graph consists of two curves: (i) a drying curve and (ii) a wetting curve.\nThe hysteric nature of the curve is due to the complex nature of soil pore\nstructure and can be attributed to the size differences between the primary\npores and the interconnecting pore throats, changes in the contact angle during\ndrying and wetting, and trapped air (Fredlund and Rahardjo, 1993; Tinjum\net al., 1997).\n\nVanapalli et al. (1999) described the several key features of WRC. One pa-\nrameter of interest is the air\u2013entry value (Sair). Conceptually, the air\u2013entry\nvalue represents the differential pressure between the air and water that is re-\nquired to cause desaturation of the largest pores, i.e., the matric suction value\nneeded to cause water to be drawn from the largest pore space within the soil\n(Brooks and Corey, 1966; Vanapalli et al., 1999). Further the author identi-\nfies several stages of desaturation (see fig. 3.5), namely: the boundary effect\nstage, the transition stage (i.e., primary and secondary), and the residual stage\nof unsaturation.\n\nIn the boundary effect stage, almost all of the soil pores are filled with\nwater (i.e., the water menisci in contact with the soil particles or aggregates\nare continuous in this stage). Under these conditions, the single stress state,\n(? ? \u00b5w), describes the behaviour of the soil. The soil desaturates at the air\u2013\nentry suction value in the transition stage. In this stage, the flow of water is in\nthe liquid phase as the applied suction increases and the soil dries rapidly with\nincreasing suction. The connectivity of the water in the voids or pores continues\nto reduce with increased values of suction, and eventually large increases in\nsuction lead to relatively small changes in the degree of saturation. The residual\nstate of saturation is considered to be the degree of saturation at which the liquid\nphase becomes discontinuous. Consequently, the residual state of saturation\nrepresents the degree of saturation value beyond which it becomes increasingly\ndifficult to remove water from a specimen by drainage. The point at which\nresidual state of saturation is reached is not always clearly defined.\n\nGupta et al. (2007) summaries influencing factors on the WRC. The distin-\nguishing features of the WRC depend on several factors such as soil structure\n(and aggregation), compaction conditions (i.e., compaction water content, com-\n\n\n\nBasic concepts of non saturated geomaterials 47\n\nFigure 3.5: Probable variation of water area in different stages of a WRC (Vana-\npalli et al., 1996)\n\npactive effort, and method of compaction), dry unit weight (or void ratio), soil\ntype (i.e., mineralogy and texture), and stress history (or stress state). The\nfour most important factors: soil type, compactive effort, compaction water\ncontent, and stress history, have the most influence on the nature of the WRC\nfor fine\u2013grained soils. In Figure 3.6 is illustrated the influence of soil type on the\nshape of the WRC. Soils with smaller pores have higher air\u2013entry value. Soils\nwith a wider range of pore sizes exhibit greater changes in matric suction with\nwater content and thus the slope of the WRC becomes steeper (Hillel, 1980;\nFredlund and Rahardjo, 1993; Vanapalli et al., 1999). As will be addressed in\nnext sections, specimens of a particular soil, in spite of having the same texture\nand mineralogy, can exhibit different WRCs if they are prepared at different\ncompaction conditions.\n\nFigure 3.6: Typical WRCs for four Canadian soils (Vanapalli et al., 1999)\n\n\n\n48 The influence of compaction on the hydro\u2013mechanical behaviour\n\n3.2.3 Stress state variables\n\nEffective stress approach\n\nTraditional geotechnical engineering studies the behaviour of water or air\nsaturated soils, that is, soils consisting of two phases: solid particles and water\nor solid particles and air. The principle of effective stress for saturated soil was\nfirst stated by Terzaghi (1943) and is commonly expressed in the following form:\n\n?? = ? ? \u00b5w (3.5)\n\nwhere ?? is the effective normal stress, ? is the total normal stress and \u00b5w is\nthe pore water pressure.\n\nEquation 3.5 is a definition of the stress state variable for saturated soils. The\nmechanical aspects of a saturated soil are governed by the effective stress. In\nother words, all the measurable effects of a change in stress, such as compression,\ndistortion, and a change in shearing resistance, are exclusively due to changes in\nthe effective stress, ??. Equation 3.5 was later modified by Bishop et al. (1960)\nto account for the effects of soil suction in unsaturated soils. These authors\nreasoned that since the unsaturated soil is a three phase system (solid, pore\nwater, and pore air) and water in voids is not continuous, the total stress will\nbe the sum of intergranular stress, the pore air pressure (\u00b5a), and the pore water\npressure (\u00b5w). They suggested that the effective stress (?\n\n?) in unsaturated soils\ncan be expressed as:\n\n?? = (?n ? \u00b5a) + ? \u00b7 (\u00b5a ? \u00b5w) (3.6)\n\nwhere ? is the fractional cross sectional area of the soil occupied by water. For\ndry soil, ? will be zero and for saturated soil ? will equal to 1.\n\nLater, Bishop and Donald (1961) pointed out that ? value not only depends\non the degree of saturation, but is also influenced by soil structure, stress mean\nvalue and stress pathway (wetting and drying) leading to a given degree of\nsaturation. Figure 3.7 shows examples of the deviation of ? value from the\ndegree of saturation for two materials. This notwithstanding, efforts were made\nby Khalili and Khabbaz (1998) in order to develop a unique relation between\n? and suction. By the study of shear strength data from several unsaturated\nsoils in the literature, a unique relation between ? and the ratio of suction to\nair\u2013entry value was showed and can be expressed as:\n\n? =\n\n[\n\n(\u00b5a ? \u00b5w)\n\n(\u00b5a ? \u00b5w)b\n\n]\n\n?0,55\n\n(3.7)\n\nwhere (\u00b5a ? \u00b5w)b refers to air entry value.\nLater, Khalili et al. (2004) proposed an incremental form of effective stress\n\nparameter to account for suction effects suggesting that for suctions greater than\nair entry, ? value varies as outlined in Equation 3.7, but for suction less than air\nentry, ? value was equal to 1. This concept was tested on shear strength data\nfrom the literature having reached good agreement between the measured and\npredicted values in all cases. As so, the authors concluded that shear strength\ncan be predicted using the effective stress concept.\n\n\n\nBasic concepts of non saturated geomaterials 49\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 3.7: ? variation vs degree of saturation for: (a) a cohesionless silt; (b)\ncompacted soils (Fredlund and Rahardjo, 1993)\n\nBiarez et al. (1991), Fleureau et al. (2001) have shown that an effective stress\napproach could be used to take into account the effect of negative pore pressure\nin the interpretation of data in the very small strain domain. Recently, Coussy\nand Dangla (2002), starting from thermodynamical considerations, confirmed\nthe validity of the effective stress approach from a theoretical point of view as\nlong as the behaviour of the unsaturated soil could be considered as elastic. The\nauthors tried to extend Biot\u2019s theory of poroelasticity used in saturated media\nto model the behaviour of unsaturated soils through an energy approach. This\napproach yields a consistent general framework to formulate the constitutive\nrelations. Fleureau et al. (2003) summarizes this approach which leads to the\nfollowing expression:\n\n?\n?\n\nij = ?ij + p\n?\n\nu \u00b7 ?ij (3.8)\n\nwhere ?ij is the stress tensor and p\n?\n\nu \u00b7 ?ij appears as an isotropic tensor and is\ntermed the capillary stress. Its expression is similar to Equation 3.6 with ? = Sw\n(degree of saturation in water), but with an additional term corresponding to\nthe work of the interfaces. Independently from the expression of p\n\n?\n\nu, which\ncan be obtained by other methods, this approach validates the effective stress\nconcept when the behaviour of the soil is elastic (Fleureau et al., 2003).\n\nAnother approach to define effective stresses starts from the expression of\nthe intergranular forces between two particles in an idealized medium, at the\nmicroscopic level, defined as a Micromechanical Model (Biarez et al., 1993).\nThe method consists of calculating the force Fcap due to water menisci between\ntwo grains of soil, modeled as balls. The balls are supposed to be perfectly\nwater\u2013wettable, gravity is neglected; the menisci are spherical tores, tangent to\nthe particles. The pressure in the air phase is atmospheric (ua = 0). According\nto the authors, if a partially saturated media consisting of solid grains, air\nand water is considered, four types of behaviour may be considered according\nto the hydric state. These types are : discontinuous water phase (kw = 0),\ndiscontinuous air phase (ka = 0), discontinuous water and air phase and the\nparticular case of clusters (fig. 3.8). Only the the two first cases were considered.\n\n\n\n50 The influence of compaction on the hydro\u2013mechanical behaviour\n\nFigure 3.8: Schematic representation of four types of behaviours (Biarez et al.,\n1993)\n\nThe first one concerns to low degrees of saturation. In this case water is\nsupposed to be discontinuous (kw = 0) and air continuous, water forms menisci\nat the contact points between particles; the water pressure inside the menisci\nis negative (uw &lt;ua). Experimentally, such conditions are observed for water\ncontents lower than than the shrinkage limit. In that case, the intergranular\nforces due to water are perpendicular to the planes tangent to the particles at the\ncontact points and cannot, therefore, result in a rearrangement of the structure\nor in a volume change. However, these forces contribute to the strength of the\nmedium. Considering two spheres with the same diameter, the expression of\nthe attraction force resulting from water meniscus (\u201ccapillary\u201d force) is:\n\nFccap = Smen \u00b7 uc (3.9)\n\nwhere Smen, the cross\u2013section area of the meniscus in the plane tangent to\nthe spheres at the contacting point, is directly related to the diameter of the\nballs and the curvature radii of the meniscus, i.e., to the negative pore water\npressure through Laplace\u2019s law, and uc is the negative pore pressure. The pas-\nsage from discontinuous to continuous medium is made by considering regular\narrangements of balls. Four types of arrangements were considered (fig. 3.9),\nwith densities ranging from 0.83 Mg/m3 (tetrahedric) to 1.81 Mg/m3 (dodeca-\nhedric). In a representative elementary volume (REV ), the capillary stress in a\ndirection is given by:\n\np\n?\n\nu =\n\n?\n\nc F\nc\ncap\n\nSREV\n(3.10)\n\nwhere\n?\n\nc F\nc\ncap is the vectorial sum of the capillary forces acting in this direction\n\nand SREV , the cross\u2013section area of the REV in the plane normal to this\ndirection. The variations of the capillary stress p\n\n?\n\nu with the negative pore water\npressure uc can be derived from the model:\n\np\n?\n\nu =\n? \u00b7 ?\n\n2 \u00b7 f(e) \u00b7 R2\n\u00b7\n\n[\n\n4R +\n3 \u00b7 (3? ?\n\n?\n\n9?2 + 8? \u00b7 R \u00b7 uc)\n\nuc\n\n]\n\n(3.11)\n\n\n\nBasic concepts of non saturated geomaterials 51\n\nFigure 3.9: Schematic representation of four types of arrangements (Biarez et al.,\n1993)\n\nwhere R is the radius of the balls, ?, the surface tension of the liquid. The\nfunction of the void ratio, f(e), is derived from a quadratic interpolation between\nthe values of f(e) for the four considered arrangements:\n\nf(e) = 0.32e2 + 4.06e + 0.11 (3.12)\n\nWhen the negative pore water pressure becomes very large, p\n?\n\nu tends towards\na maximum value given by:\n\np\n?\n\nu max =\n2 \u00b7 ? \u00b7 ?\n\nf(e) \u00b7 R\n(3.13)\n\nThe concept of capillary stress can be extended to real soils, e.g. by deriving\nthe \u201ccharacteristic dimension\u201d R from the experimental data (Biarez et al.,\n1993).\n\nAlso based on this model, Modaressi et al. (1995) proposed another expres-\nsion (eqs. 3.14 and 3.15) for determination of p\n\n?\n\nu.\n\np\n?\n\n= p\n?\n\nu max \u00b7 tgh\n\n(\n\nuc\np\n\n?\n\nu max\n\n)\n\n(3.14)\n\np\n?\n\nu max =\n2 \u00b7 ? \u00b7 ?\n\ng(e) \u00b7 D10\n(3.15)\n\nAs so, for low degrees of saturation effective stress is given by Equation 3.16.\n\n?\n?\n\n= ? + p\n?\n\nu (3.16)\n\nThe second case refers to high degrees of saturation. At this stage the air\nforms isolated bubbles within the voids (ka = 0). The water phase is continuous\nand completely wets the grains. As there is no contact between the air bubbles\nand the solid grains, pore air pressure plays no part in the strength of the\nmedium, but the presence of the bubbles makes it more compressible. In that\ncase, Terzaghi\u2019s effective stress concept is valid and p\n\n?\n\nu is equal to uc. As so, the\nabove expression became as follows:\n\n?\n?\n\n= ? + p\n?\n\nu = ? + uc (3.17)\n\n\n\n52 The influence of compaction on the hydro\u2013mechanical behaviour\n\nMany experimental validations of this model have been presented by the\nauthors in the past years that showed, in particular, its ability to model the\nfailure criterion of unsaturated soils.\n\nIndependent state variable approach\n\nAnother concept to describe unsaturated soil behaviour is the independent\nstate variable approach. Fredlund and Morgenstern (1977) presented a theoret-\nical stress analysis of an unsaturated soil on the basis of multiphase continuum\nmechanics. The unsaturated soil was considered a four\u2013phase system. The soil\nparticles were assumed to be incompressible and the soil was treated though\nit were chemically inert. The analysis concluded that stress state of an unsat-\nurated soil can be described by any two of the three possible combinations of\nstress variables, namely: total normal stress (?), pore air pressure (\u00b5a), and\npore water pressure (\u00b5u). Possible combinations are given in Table 3.2.\n\nTable 3.2: Possible combinations of stress state variables for an unsaturated soil\n\nReference pressure Stress state variables\nAir, \u00b5a (? ? \u00b5a) and (\u00b5a ? \u00b5w)\n\nWater, \u00b5w (? ? \u00b5w) and (\u00b5a ? \u00b5w)\nTotal, ? (? ? \u00b5a) and (? ? \u00b5w)\n\nThese researchers showed that stress state variables, (? ?\u00b5a) and (\u00b5a ?\u00b5w),\nwere the most advantageous combination because the effects of a change in\ntotal normal stress can be separated from the effects caused by a change in the\npore\u2013water pressure. The first tensor contains the net normal stress terms and\nthe conventional shear stress components. The second tensor represents the\nmatric suction stress, being an isotropic tensor. The complete form of the stress\nstate for an unsaturated soil can be written as following two independent stress\ntensors, which are illustrated in Figure 3.10.\n\n(? ? \u00b5a) =\n\n?\n\n?\n\n(?x ? \u00b5a) ?yx ?zx\n?xy (?y ? \u00b5a) ?zy\n?xz ?yz (?z ? \u00b5a)\n\n?\n\n? (3.18)\n\nand\n\n(\u00b5a ? \u00b5w) =\n\n?\n\n?\n\n(\u00b5a ? \u00b5w) 0 0\n0 (\u00b5a ? \u00b5w) 0\n0 0 (\u00b5a ? \u00b5w)\n\n?\n\n? (3.19)\n\nFredlund and Morgenstern (1977) also carried out he null\u2013type test by vary-\ning the individual components (?, \u00b5a, \u00b5w) of the stress sate variables in a such\nway that the stress state variables remained constant assuming that this would\nproduce no distortion or volumetric change of the soil. Based on the results of\nthe null tests, the above stress state variables were qualified for describing the\nmechanical behavior of unsaturated soils.\n\nAccordingly to this approach, a saturated soil can be viewed as a special\ncase of an unsaturated soil. The four phases in an unsaturated soil reduce to\n\n\n\nHydro\u2013mechanical behaviour 53\n\nFigure 3.10: The stress state variables for unsaturated soil\n\ntwo phases for a saturated soil (i.e., soil particles and water). There is also a\nsmooth transition between the stress state for a saturated soil and that of an\nunsaturated soil. As an unsaturated soil approaches saturation, the degree of\nsaturation, S, approaches 100%. The pore\u2013water pressure, \u00b5w, approaches the\npore\u2013air pressure, \u00b5a, and the matric suction term, (\u00b5w \u2013 \u00b5a), goes towards\nzero, disappearing this stress tensor. Only the first stress tensor (Eq. 3.20)\nis retained for a saturated soil when considering this special case, commonly\nreferred to as effective stress (Terzaghi, 1943).\n\n(? ? \u00b5w) =\n\n?\n\n?\n\n(?x ? \u00b5w) ?yx ?zx\n?xy (?y ? \u00b5w) ?zy\n?xz ?yz (?z ? \u00b5w)\n\n?\n\n? (3.20)\n\n3.3 Hydro\u2013mechanical behaviour\n\nIt is widely recognised that hydro\u2013mechanical behaviour of many geoma-\nterials, in terms of stiffness (Tatsuoka et al., 1997), compressibility and shear\nstrength (Burland, 1990) is significantly affected by structure.\n\nWith respect to compacted geomaterials, the compaction conditions, namely\nmolding water content, compaction energy and compaction technique play a fun-\ndamental role on the structure of compacted geomaterials, that in turn, strongly\naffect their hydro\u2013mechanical behaviour. Lambe (1958b) distinguished a floc-\nculated fabric in clay samples compacted dry of optimum and a dispersed fabric\nin samples compacted wet of optimum. Subsequent inspection by scanning elec-\ntron microscopy and mercury intrusion porosimetry allowed direct observations\nof pore size distribution (Barden and Sides, 1971; Delage et al., 1996; Suriol\nand Lloret, 2007; Romero and Simms, 2008; Koliji et al., 2010). Fine\u2013grained\nsoils compacted dry of optimum generally tend to exhibit a fabric made up\nof aggregates having a bimodal pore size distribution, whereas samples com-\npacted wet of optimum tend to show a more homogeneous matrix\u2013dominated\nfabric and single pore size distribution (Barden and Sides, 1971; Delage et al.,\n1996). Experimental evidence have shown the influence of structure on the\nhydro\u2013mechanical behaviour of geomaterials (Seed and Chan, 1959; Santucci di\nMagistris et al., 1998; Sivakumar and Wheeler, 2000; Wheeler and Sivakumar,\n2000; d\u2019Onofrio and Penna, 2003; Santucci di Magistris and Tatsuoka, 2004).\n\n\n\n54 The influence of compaction on the hydro\u2013mechanical behaviour\n\nWith respect to geomaterials in unsaturated state, not only different struc-\ntures but also suction plays an important role on its hydro\u2013mechanical be-\nhaviour. With the purpose to a better understanding of the hydro\u2013behaviour of\nunsaturated geomaterials, firstly the influence of compaction conditions on the\nmechanical behaviour (stiffness, compressibility and strength) of saturated geo-\nmaterials is reviewed. Then, the influence of compaction conditions on hydro\u2013\nbehaviour of unsaturated geomaterials is addressed.\n\n3.3.1 Influence of compaction on saturated geomaterials\n\nStiffness\n\nIt is known that compaction conditions strongly affect dry density, thus void\nratio, which plays a fundamental role on the small strain stiffness of geomate-\nrials. A general expression as proposed by different investigators for the small\nstrain shear modulus (G0) of geomaterials is of the following form:\n\nG0 = S \u00b7 f(e) \u00b7 p\n?n (3.21)\n\nwhere S is a non\u2013dimensional material constant reflecting the fabric and struc-\nture of the soil, f(e) is the void ratio function and p\n\n?\n\nis the mean effective\nprinciple stress or confining pressure. A number of studies have been conducted\nto estimate void ratio function (Hardin and Richart, 1963; Lo Presti et al., 1995;\nSantos, 1999; Hadiwardoyo, 2002). Two types of formulas are used:\n\nf (e) =\n(B ? e)\n\n2\n\n1 + e\n(3.22)\n\nf (e) = e?x (3.23)\n\nEquation 3.22 results from the experimental observation of shear waves in\nsoils (Vs) conducted by Hardin and Richart (1963), whereas Equation 3.23 re-\nsults from Lo Presti et al. (1995) investigations. Santos (1999) and Gupta et al.\n(2007) summarize functions and constants in proposed equations. As a general\nconclusion, modulus increases with decreasing void ratio. Nevertheless, it is\nnoteworthy that the differences between these reference void ratio functions are\nmore evident at low void ratios.\n\nd\u2019Onofrio and Penna (2003) investigated the influence of compaction con-\nditions on the small strain behaviour of a clayey silt with a clay fraction of\nabout 28%, liquid limit about 50% and plasticity index of 17.8%. Specimens\nwere prepared at the same dry density and water content adopting two different\ncompaction procedures: dynamic (Standard Proctor) and kneading (Harvard)\ncompaction technique. Both Proctor and Harvard specimens were saturated at\nconstant volume prior to undergo the torsional shear and resonant column tests.\n\nThe initial shear modulus measured on Proctor and Harvard compacted\nspecimens during isotropic compression phase are plotted respectively in Figure\n3.11. The relationship between G0 and p\n\n?\n\nwas found to be not unique: e.g. G0\nmeasured at the same mean effective stress, can vary up to 30% for different\nwater content. Data was fitted by power function (Eq. 3.24) with stiffness index,\nn, slightly varying with water content, ranging between 0.3 and 0.4, regardless\nof the compaction procedure adopted.\n\n\n\nHydro\u2013mechanical behaviour 55\n\nG0\np\n\n?\n\nr\n\n= S \u00b7\n\n(\n\np\n?\n\np\n?\n\nr\n\n)n\n\n(3.24)\n\nThe stiffness coefficient S was found to be substantially affected by both wa-\nter content and preparation procedure even though when initial shear modulus\nwas normalized by the same void ratio funtion. The normalised stiffness coef-\nficients, S?, are plotted in Figure 3.11c against the compaction water content\nfor specimens dynamically compacted (open dots) and by kneading (full dots).\nThe influence of both water content and preparation technique is effective in\na limited range around the optimum water content. The authors argue that\ncompaction water content lead to structure of different stiffness in the tested\nsoil while the effect of the preparation technique results in different texture of\nthe soil that, in turn, may yield to a different anisotropy induced in the soils by\ndifferent compaction method.\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 3.11: Initial shear modulus versus mean effective stress (a) Proctor spec-\nimens and (b) Harvard specimens; (c) Normalised stiffness coefficient variation\nwith initial molding water content (d\u2019Onofrio and Penna, 2003)\n\nSantucci di Magistris and Tatsuoka (2004) carried out a similar investigation\non a silty sand (Meltramo silty sand) with Dmax of 2 mm, Cu of about 400, a\nclayey fraction of about 16% and wL of 35% and IP of 14%. Triaxial com-\npression tests were performed on specimens of Meltrano silty sand compacted\n\n\n\n56 The influence of compaction on the hydro\u2013mechanical behaviour\n\nat different molding water contents and with different compaction energy (fig.\n3.12a). The relationships between the effective vertical stress (?\n\n?\n\nv) and E0 mod-\nulus are shown in Figure 3.12b includind isotropic and anisotropic tests results.\nThe authors reported two trends: (i) at isotropic stress states, the E0 value\nincreases with increasing ?\n\n?\n\nv, but in a different way at anisotropic stress state;\n(ii) the speciemns compacted at the optimum water content have the largest\nstiffness when compared to the values of the specimens compacted dry and wet\nof optimum.\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 3.12: (a) Compaction curves; (b) Relationship between vertical effective\nstress and small strain Young modulus; (c) Relationship between the small strain\nstiffness coefficients corrected for void ratio and water content ratio (Santucci di\nMagistris and Tatsuoka, 2004)\n\nA similar method to d\u2019Onofrio and Penna (2003) was used for data inter-\npretation. Data from isotropic stress states was fitted by a power law (Eq.\n3.24) and a stiffness index around 0.6 was obtained for the different molding\nwater contents. Then, the power law was normalized by the same void ratio\nfunction. The stiffness index, n, was the same and the relationship between\nstiffness coefficient, S? and remolding water content is shown in Figure 3.12c.\nSamples compacted by using modified Proctor energy exhibited a peak value at\noptimum water content. The authors attributed the variation of S? to effects\nof microstructure even though they could not explain why it peaks at optimum\nwater content.\n\n\n\nHydro\u2013mechanical behaviour 57\n\nCompressibility\n\nLambe (1958a) reported that, at relatively low stress levels, clay specimens\ncompacted wet of optimum were more compressible than those compacted dry\nof optimum, while the reverse was observed at relatively high stresses.\n\nd\u2019Onofrio and Penna (2003) also investigated the compressibility of com-\npacted specimens. The initial water content was found to significantly affects\nthe compressibility of both Harvard and Proctor compacted specimens. The\ncompressibility index (?) first decrease at increasing moisture content down\nto a minimum value corresponding to the optimum water content and then\nincrease on the wet side of optimum water contents, as illustrated in Figure\n3.13. They state that it appears that compaction at different water content\naffects the soil constants within isotropic compression line, thus resulting in\neffectively different materials. From isotropic compression tests on compacted\nspecimens of Meltramo silty sand Santucci di Magistris and Tatsuoka (2004)\nfound a similar trend. From evaluation whether the variation in the ? value\nwith molding water content was due solely to the different compacted densities\nor effects of microstructure, they concluded that not only dry density, but also\nthe microstructure controls the compression properties.\n\nFigure 3.13: Compressibility parameters (d\u2019Onofrio and Penna, 2003)\n\nSantucci di Magistris et al. (1998) investigated the influence of compaction\nconditions on the compressibility of Meltramo silty sand by means of isotropic\nor K\u2013compression stages in triaxial cell and oedometers tests. Speciemens were\nprepared to different degrees of moisture and density adopting three different\nmethods: (1) modified Proctor compaction; (2) hand\u2013tamping compaction; (3)\nslurry consolidation. Specimens of Meltramo silty sand were compacted with\nmodified Proctor at optimum and wet of optimum (+2.5%) water content in\norder to study the influence of water content on the compressibility. It was\nfound higher compressibility from specimen compacted wet ot optimum, which\nagrees with results from d\u2019Onofrio and Penna (2003). In contrast, the same ?\nwas obtained from remoulded specimens with different initial water contents,\nbut the position of the normal consolidation line of the wetter specimen lyied\nhigher in the compression plane (v,p\n\n?\n\n) .\n\nFurther, Santucci di Magistris et al. (1998) also conducted isotropic com-\npression tests on compacted specimens (modified Proctor) with slightly different\n\n\n\n58 The influence of compaction on the hydro\u2013mechanical behaviour\n\ninitial void ratios. Identical ? were obtained (fig. 3.14a).\n\nWith respect to compaction method, results obtained by d\u2019Onofrio and\nPenna (2003) showed that a change from dynamic to kneading compaction has\nrelatively little effect on the compressibility index (see fig. 3.13), but differences\nwere found on the axial and radial deformations measured during isotropic com-\npression stage, where the ratio between axial and radial deformations was al-\nways found to be lower than 1 for the dynamic compaction and higher than 1 for\nthe specimens prepared by kneading compaction. Santucci di Magistris et al.\n(1998) found no differences between compressibility index obtained from com-\npacted specimens with modified Proctor and with hand\u2013tamping compaction\n(fig. 3.14a). Hence, they claim that limited differences in preparation do not\nseem to affect the compressibility of the studied material, provided that the\nsame initial density is attained through the compaction technique. In contrast,\nremoulded specimens presented higher ? (fig. 3.14b).\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 3.14: Compression curves from Meltramo silty sand: (a) modified Proctor\nand tamped specimens; (b) modified Proctor, tamped and remoulded specimens\n(Santucci di Magistris et al., 1998)\n\nStrength\n\nExperimental evidence have shown that compaction conditions may influence\nthe pre\u2013peak stress\u2013strain behaviour (d\u2019Onofrio and Penna, 2003; Santucci di\nMagistris and Tatsuoka, 2004), but seems to do not influence ultimate shear\nstrength (Seed and Chan, 1959; Santucci di Magistris et al., 1998; Santucci di\nMagistris and Tatsuoka, 2004; Tarantino and Tombolato, 2005; Oh et al., 2008).\n\nd\u2019Onofrio and Penna (2003) and Santucci di Magistris and Tatsuoka (2004)\ninvestigated the pre\u2013peak behaviour and reported similar behaviour to the one\nverified in the small strain domain. Proctor specimens compacted at optimum\nwater content exhibited higher shear stress rather than specimens compacted\nat dry and wet of optimum. Santucci di Magistris and Tatsuoka (2004) showed\nthat relationship between the q/p\n\n?\n\nvalue at a fixed strain and the dry density be-\ncomes less unique as the referred strain becomes smaller, reflecting the pre\u2013peak\nbehaviour at small strains. As the referred strain becomes larger a more unique\nrelationship is obtained rather independent of water content and compaction\n\n\n\nHydro\u2013mechanical behaviour 59\n\nenergy level.\n\nExperimental data from Santucci di Magistris et al. (1998), Tarantino and\nTombolato (2005) and Oh et al. (2008) evidence that both ultimate shear\nstrength are independent of compaction conditions in the (q,p\n\n?\n\n) and (v,p\n?\n\n)\nspace, as illustrated in Figure 3.15. In the light of critical state theory (Wood,\n1990), the critical state models for saturated soils are defined in terms of three\nstate variables: mean net effective stress, p\n\n?\n\n, deviator stress, q, and specific vol-\nume, v. At critical state these variables are related through three critical state\nparameters, M, ?, and ? and the following equations:\n\nq = M \u00b7 p\n?\n\n(3.25)\n\nv = ? ? ? \u00b7 ln(p\n?\n\n) (3.26)\n\nwhere M is the slope of the projection of the critical state line in (q,p\n?\n\n) plane,\n? is the intercept (at p\n\n?\n\n= 1 kPa), and ? is the slope of the projection of the\ncritical state line in (v,ln(p\n\n?\n\n)) plane.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 3.15: (a) Compaction curves; (b) Peak and ultimate shear strength in\nthe (q,p) plane and ultimate void ratio (Tarantino and Tombolato, 2005)\n\n\n\n60 The influence of compaction on the hydro\u2013mechanical behaviour\n\n3.3.2 Influence of compaction on unsaturated geomateri-\nals\n\nWater retention curve\n\nSpecimens of the same geomaterial, in spite of having same texture and\nmineralogy, can exhibit different water retention curves if they are prepared\nat different initial molding water contents. As a result, the hydro\u2013mechanical\nbehaviour will also differ.\n\nExperimental data about the effect of molding water content on the water re-\ntention curve is provided by Marinho and Stuermer (2000). They examined the\neffect of compaction water content on the drying branch of the water retention\ncurve for a residual soil of Gneiss (LL = 48%, PL = 29% and % &lt;2\u00b5m = 45%).\nIn Figure 3.16 is shown results from samples compacted at Modified Proctor en-\nergy and varying initial water content. Specimens were equilibrated, by drying,\nto a different water content and water retention curve associated with each\nspecimen was determined.\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c) (d)\n\nFigure 3.16: Water retention curves of a low plasticity soil obtained by drying\nof compacted samples at different conditions: (a), (b) and (c) initial state; (d)\nmeasured water retention curve (Marinho and Stuermer, 2000)\n\nOne note that, though specimens MP2 and MP4 have the same initial dry\ndensity, at different compaction water content presented different water reten-\ntion curves. During the drying process samples compacted near the optimum\n\n\n\nHydro\u2013mechanical behaviour 61\n\nwater content or below it (MP2) always presented smaller suction than samples\ncompacted at wet of optimum (MP4). For low degrees of saturation curves tend\nto be similar, irrespective of the original compaction state. The differences re-\nported were attributed to differences in microstructure built into the specimen\nby the compaction procedure.\n\nVanapalli et al. (1999) investigated the influence of initial water content on\nthe hidraulic behaviour of sandy clay. Specimens were statically compacted to\n100 mm in diameter and 21 mm in height in a single layer. A series of tests was\ncarried out on three sets of specimens, each one prepared with the same dry\ndensity, i.e, constant void ratio, and with initial water contents ranging from\n12.5 and 19.2%, which included dry of optimum, optimum and wet of optimum\nspecimens. The matric suction was determined from individaully compacted\nspecimens with a null pressure plate using the axis\u2013translating technique. The\nresults obtained from each specimen allowed to compare the relationship be-\ntween matric suction versus degree of saturation with the drying water retention\ncurve determined from a single specimen and are shown in Figure 3.17.\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 3.17: Compaction of soil\u2013water characteristics for specimens compacted\nat the same initial vois ratio and: (a) compacted dry of optimum water content;\n(b) compacted at optimum water content; (c) compacted wet of optimum water\ncontent (Vanapalli et al., 1999)\n\nFigures 3.17a, 3.17b and 3.17c shows the best\u2013fit drying water retention\ncurves for specimens with water contents dry of optimum, optimum and wet\nof optimum, respectively, and results of individuals compacted specimens with\nthe same void ratios and varying water contents. At each set of results, differ-\nences between best\u2013fit drying water retention curves and results of individuals\n\n\n\n62 The influence of compaction on the hydro\u2013mechanical behaviour\n\ncompacted specimens are given to varying initial water contents, which leads\nto different structures (and aggregation) during compaction. For the range of\nvoid ratios studied (0.52\u20130.58), the authors found a clear relationship between\ngravemetric water content versus matric suction and concluded that was the ini-\ntial water content which governed the matric suction of individually compacted\nspecimens.\n\nDifferent void ratios can be achieved by varying compaction energy. The\ninfluence of void ratio on the hydraulic behaviour is given by the variations\non the water retention curve due to variations on void ratio. Barrera (2002)\ninvestigated the influence of void ratio on water retention curve through mea-\nsuring suction of compacted specimens at a fixed dry density and varying water\ncontents. Suction was measured in each sample and water retention curve is\nplotted. If the target dry density is changed a new water retention curve is\ndetermined. Figure 3.18 shows the final result for the Barcelona low plasticity\nsilty clay. For a given degree of saturation, increasing the soil density leads to\nincreasing suction. Differences tend to reduce as the soil becomes wetter, but\nthe effect of density is clearly marked.\n\nFigure 3.18: Water retention curves for different constant densities of Barcelona\nlow plasticity silty clay (Barrera, 2002)\n\nAn alternative procedure to determine the influence of void ratio on the\nWRC consists on compaction to a given state followed by suitable application\nof a stress\u2013suction path. Following this procedure Karube and Kawai (2001) and\nSun et al. (2007) confirmed the above conclusion, i.e., the denser the specimen\nthe higher the degree of saturation at the same imposed suction and the main\nwetting and drying curves are dependent on the current density.\n\nThe influence of both initial water content and compaction energy is evi-\ndenced from investigations performed by Vanapalli et al. (1999) and Tarantino\nand Tombolato (2005). In Figure 3.19 is shown moisture density compaction\ncurves for different compaction pressures and respective water retention curves\nfor a speswhite kaolin presented by Tarantino and Tombolato (2005). Though\nonly optimum and wet of optimum seems to be reached only for 1200 kPa com-\npaction vertical stress, it is clear that water retention curves depends on com-\n\n\n\nHydro\u2013mechanical behaviour 63\n\npaction pressure. Similar results were obtained from Vanapalli et al. (1999).\nMoreover, it is noteworthy that the air\u2013occlusion suction for the specimens\ncompacted at 1200kPa vertical stress is very close to the suction of the spec-\nimen at the optimum (solid square in fig. 3.19). This result shows that the\ntransition from dry to wet optimum states corresponds to the transition from\ncontinuous to discontinuous air phase.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 3.19: (a) Static compaction curves for the vertical stresses of 300, 600 and\n1200 kPa. The solid square indicates the optimum for the 100 kPa compaction\ncurve; (b) Water retention curves for the respective compaction vertical stresses\n(Tarantino and Tombolato, 2005)\n\nInvestigations from Huang et al. (1998), Gallipoli et al. (2003) and Tarantino\nand Tombolato (2005) confirms that the water retention curves are void ratio\ndependent and main drying curves and main wetting curves are characterised by\ntwo surfaces in the space (s, e, Sr) or (s, e, ew), s being suction, Sr being degree\nof saturation, e being the void ratio and ew the water ratio (volume of water\nper volume of solids). Furthermore, Tarantino (2009) concluded that mechanical\nscanning behaviour investigated in the reconstituted studied materials was also\naffected by void ratio.\n\nStiffness\n\nFurther, Fleureau et al. (2003), Coronado et al. (2005), Yang et al. (2008)\nand Caicedo et al. (2009) have investigated the influence of water content on\nthe mechanical behaviour.\n\nFleureau et al. (2003) investigated the small strains properties of a resid-\nual silty sand (Perafita sand). Several tests performed under several confining\nstresses and stress deviators and under isotropic stresses allowed to studied the\ninfluence of water content on maximum modulus. Measurements were carried\nout using two different triaxial cells with local strain measurements for tests\non large (320 mm high and 160 mm in diameter) and small (140 mm high and\n70 mm in diameter) specimens. Specimens were compacted with varying mois-\nture content to the chosen dry density by means of a vibrating hammer. Figure\n3.20a shows that, for the unsaturated specimens and for the same void ratio and\nunder the same vertical stress, there is a general increase in the modulus when\n\n\n\n64 The influence of compaction on the hydro\u2013mechanical behaviour\n\nthe water content decreases, as long as the water content is strictly larger than\n0. For the unsaturated specimens, the variations of normalised modulus ver-\nsus total vertical stress approximately followed a power law, with an exponent\nn = 0.35 ? 0.45. On the other hand, the lines for the dry and quasi\u2013saturated\nspecimens were nearly superimposed, with a stiffer slope (n = 0.68).\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 3.20: (a) Normalised Young\u2019s modulus versus total vertical stress for\nspecimens of Perafia sand at different water contents and densities; (b) Inter-\npretation of very small strains triaxial tests using Biarez et al. (1993) microme-\nchanical model for the definition of effective stresses (Fleureau et al., 2003)\n\nFurther, the interpretation of small strain modulus using Biarez et al. (1993)\nmicromechanical model for the definition of effective stresses was attempted.\nExpressed against the effective stress, all the results were correctly located near\nthe regression line of the dry and quasi\u2013saturated specimens, as illustrated in\nFigure 3.20b.\n\nAlso Coronado et al. (2005) and Caicedo et al. (2009) found identical trend\nfor unbound granular materials having attributed the increasing modulus with\ndecreasing water content to the increase in capillary forces in the menisci that\nform between grains. Also here lines corresponding to the evolution of modulus\nwith total vertical stress are more or less parallel for different moisture contents,\nas illustrated in Figure 3.21.\n\nQian et al. (1993) studied the effects of initial void ratio at compaction\non the very small strain shear modulus of sands in resonant column. All the\ntests were conducted under isotropic stress conditions. Thirteen cohesionless\nsoils were selected for testing to investigate shear modulus under unsaturated\nconditions. The test sands were prepared by mixing soil and distilled water to a\npre\u2013selected degree of saturation. Specimens were then prepared by compacting\nthe soil-water mix to the required void ratio in a metal mould mounted directly\non a resonant column device. As illustrated in Figure 3.22, they demonstrated\nthat the value of the maximum shear modulus ratio should be greatest in a soil\nthat has the lowest void ratio, all other factors constant.\n\nThe influence of compaction conditions on the small strain modulus was\ninvestigated by Mancuso et al. (2002) from resonant column tests on Meltramo\nsilty sand. Specimens were tested on a controlled\u2013suction resonant column\u2013\n\n\n\nHydro\u2013mechanical behaviour 65\n\nFigure 3.21: Secant modulus versus total vertical stress for specimens of un-\nbound granular materials with 12% of fines and Plasticity Index of 15% (Caicedo\net al., 2009)\n\ntorsional shear device after compaction by the modified Proctor at the optimum\nmolding water content (wOPM = 9.8%) and on the wet side of the compaction\ncurve (wOPM + 2.5%), resulting an average specific volume of v = 1.338 \u00b1 0.009\nand v = 1.462 \u00b1 0.004, respectively. Experimental data showed that the effect\nof suction on initial shear stiffness is significant, causing an increase in Gmax\nranging from 50 to 85% for the optimum compacted soil and from 40 to 165%\nfor the wet of optimum compacted soil, depending on stress level. Most of\nthe effects were detected for suctions ranging from 0 to about 200 kPa. For\nvalues higher than 200 kPa, Gmax tends toward a threshold that depends on the\nnet stress level. The stiffness versus suction curves showed an S\u2013shaped trend\n(fig. 3.23) which was explained on the basis of the different ways in which bulk\nwater and menisci water affect soil behavior, and was theoretically justified by\ndistinguishing three different zones on each Gmax versus suction curve: zone 1\npertaining to suctions lower than the air\u2013entry value of the soil (i.e., bulk\u2013water\nregulated behavior); zone 2 involving a progressive shift of soil behavior from a\nbulk\u2013water regulated response to a menisci-water regulated response; and zone\n3 where menisci\u2013water effects prevail.\n\nFigure 3.22: G0/G0(dry) versus degree of saturation at various void ratios for\nOttawa F-125 sand (Qian et al., 1993)\n\n\n\n66 The influence of compaction on the hydro\u2013mechanical behaviour\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 3.23: Initial shear stiffness in controlled\u2013suction RC tests: (a) optimum\ncompacted material; (b) wet of optimum compacted material (Mancuso et al.,\n2002)\n\nMore recently Sharma and Bukkapatnam (2008) reached a similar trend\nthrough a different procedure. A stiffness investigation was carried out on spec-\nimens of a clayey silt with 19% clay and 79% silt, compacted at optimum water\ncontent 16% and saturated in such a way the dry density of specimens was\nmaintained. Specimens were then subjected to dying by increasing air pressure\nand stiffness of specimen was obtained from shear wave velocity measurements\nby means of bender elements. G0 increases with decreasing degree of saturation,\nthus increasing matric suction, and S\u2013shape was verified.\n\nThe influence of all compaction conditions on the small strain modulus was\nstudied by Sawangsuriya et al. (2008). They investigated the relationship of\nsmall strain modulus with moisture content for different types of geomateri-\nals, namely a lean clay (CL), a silt (ML) and a clayey sand (SC). Small strain\nmodulus was obtained from shear wave velocity by means of bender elements.\nSpecimens were prepared with standard Proctor effort over a range of molding\nwater contents: 4% and 2% dry of optimum, optimum and 2% and 4% wet of op-\ntimum. The variation of shear modulus with matric suction and molding water\ncontent is presented in Figure 3.24. In general, the shear modulus increases as\nmatric suction increases and molding water content decreases. They stated that\nshear modulus of a given compacted soil depends primarily on matric suction\nand to a lesser degree on molding water content and dry unit weight.\n\nSawangsuriya et al. (2008) also investigated the relationship of small strain\nmodulus with compaction energy, namely, reduced, and enhanced Proctor, which\ncorresponds to 15, 25 and 35 hammer blows per layer. Material studied was a\nsandy clay (SC). As illustrated in Figure 3.24, the influence of compaction en-\nergy on suction is less significant than molding water content. The SC material\ncompacted with standard Proctor effort had higher suction than that compacted\nwith enhanced and reduced Proctor efforts. This notwithstanding, at lower wa-\nter contents, a higher small stiffness modulus was obtained from specimens\ncompacted by the enhanced Proctor (higher compaction energy). Differences\non small strain stiffness tend to vanish at higher molding water contents.\n\n\n\nHydro\u2013mechanical behaviour 67\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c) (d)\n\nFigure 3.24: (a) Dry unit weight and (b) matric suction versus molding water\ncontent; Small\u2013strain shear modulus versus (c) matric suction and (d) molding\nwater content for clayey sand (SC), lean clay (CL), and silt (ML) soils (Sawang-\nsuriya et al., 2008)\n\nCompressibility\n\nSivakumar and Wheeler (2000) and Wheeler and Sivakumar (2000) con-\nducted an investigation on the influence of compaction condition on the me-\nchanical behaviour of an unsaturated compacted clay. The effect of molding\nwater content and compaction pressure on the compression behaviour were high-\nlighted.\n\nTo investigate the influence of molding water content a series of 12 specimens\n(test series 2) were statically compacted at water content of 25%, corresponding\nto 4% dry of optimum from standard Proctor compaction. A specific volume\nof 1.976\u00b10.009 and a degree of saturation of 68.1\u00b10.8 were obtained. Another\nseries of 6 specimens (test series 4) involved static compaction at water content of\n28.5% (near the standard Proctor optimum), resulting in similar specific volume,\n1.954\u00b10.009 and a degree of saturation of 79.8\u00b10.9. Controlled\u2013suction triaxial\ntests were carried out and in Figure 3.25a are presented the results from isotropic\nconsolidation stage for test series 2 and 4. Small differences of the values of\nspecific volume were observed between test series. This notwithstanding, in\nparticular the post\u2013yield data at zero suction show much lower values of specific\n\n\n\n68 The influence of compaction on the hydro\u2013mechanical behaviour\n\nvolume in series 4 than in series 2. The authors argue that this results are due\nto the change in compaction water content, rather than to the small difference\nin initial specific volume achieved by the two methods of compaction because\na much larger difference in the compaction\u2013induced specific volume, between\nother test series, had a lesser effect.\n\nIn addition, Sivakumar and Wheeler (2000) and Wheeler and Sivakumar\n(2000) investigated the influence of void ratio on the mechanichal behaviour\nof unsaturated speswhite kaolin (fig. 3.25b). Controlled\u2013suction triaxial tests\nwere performed on specimens statically compacted at two different compaction\npressures, hence different void ratios were obtained at the same water content.\nThe greater compaction pressure employed, hence the lower void ratio, has\nresulted in additional expansion of the LC yield curve. Moreover, they reported\nthat normal compression lines from samples at higher dry density lie below\nthe corresponding normal compression lines from samples at lower dry density,\nalthough the lines from the two series of tests do tend to converge at high\nvalues of mean net stress. As so, authors stated that this difference suggests\nthat compaction to a different pressure affects some of the soil constants, thus\nresulting in effectively a different material.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 3.25: (a) Influence of compaction water content on the isotropic com-\npression behaviour: comparison of typical results from series 2 and series 4;\n(b) Influence of compaction pressure on the isotropic compression behaviour\n(Sivakumar and Wheeler, 2000)\n\nAlso Estabragh et al. (2004) and Sun et al. (2007) found initial void ratio to\ninfluences the collapse behaviour of geomaterials. Figure 3.26 shows the results\nof isotropic compression tests on compacted specimens at different initial void\nratios under suction of 147 kPa. These specimens were prepared by statically\ncompacting samples to different vertical stresses at the same water content of\n26%. It can be seen that even under the same imposed suction, a looser specimen\nhas higher compressibility. Moreover, the yield stress increases as the initial void\nratio of the compacted specimen decreases, i.e., there is an additional expansion\nof the LC yield curve as mentioned above.\n\nFollowing an identical procedure to Sun et al. (2007), Estabragh et al. (2004)\ncarried out an investigation on an unsaturated compacted silty soil. Isotropic\nconsolidation tests on controlled\u2013suction triaxial apparatus were performed on\nloose and dense specimens prepared by static compaction at the same water\n\n\n\nHydro\u2013mechanical behaviour 69\n\nFigure 3.26: Results of isotropic compression tests on unsaturated clay com-\npacted at different initial void ratios (Sun et al., 2007)\n\ncontent but with two different compaction pressures. They found that com-\npressibility index (?) for dense (fig. 3.27a) and loose (Fig. 3.27b) samples is a\nfunction of suction. The value of ? decreased with increasing suction for suctions\ngreater than 80 and 100 kPa for dense and loose samples, respectively. However,\nit appeared to decrease sharply as the suction was reduced to zero. This be-\nhaviour was not consistent with the model of Alonso et al. (1990), who proposed\nthat the slope of isotropic normal consolidation lines ? decreases monotonically\nwith increasing suction from the saturated value, becoming asymptotic at high\nsuctions. Authors argue that it was possible that ? increased with decreas-\ning suction right down to zero suction, and there was then a discontinuity in\nthe value of ? corresponding to the change from unsaturated to saturated con-\nditions. In contrast to conclusions from Sivakumar and Wheeler (2000) and\nWheeler and Sivakumar (2000), experimental results for both dense and loose\nsamples show that the normal compression lines for different values of suction\ndiverge with increasing mean net stress, where this divergence was more clear\nin the case of dense samples.\n\nFigure 3.27: Variation of ?(s) with suction for: (a) dense samples; (b) loose\nsamples (Estabragh et al., 2004)\n\n\n\n70 The influence of compaction on the hydro\u2013mechanical behaviour\n\nFinally, the influence of compaction technique was investigated by Sivakumar\nand Wheeler (2000) and Wheeler and Sivakumar (2000). The results indicated\nthat a change from static compaction to dynamic compaction (standard Proctor)\nwas found to had relatively little effect on the soil behaviour.\n\nMancuso et al. (2002) also performed controlled\u2013suction tests on triaxial\napparatus to study compressibility of Meltramo silty sand of unsaturated spec-\nimens compacted at different molding water contents and dry densities, as pre-\nviously referred. From experimental data they found that compressibility in-\ndices almost double going from optimum to wet of optimum, which denotes the\ninfluence of molding water content. Furthermore, compressibility indices sig-\nnificantly decreased with increasing suction. Data showed typical behaviour of\nfine\u2013grained unsaturated soils (Alonso et al., 1990) in terms of compressibility,\nin particular the apparent yield points which were fitted by a unique LC locus,\nas they belong to a single after\u2013compaction yield curve.\n\nStrength\n\nFleureau et al. (2003) conducted consolidated undrained triaxial tests, with\nmeasurement of the negative pore water pressure, on specimens compacted with\nvarying initial water content. The test results are shown in Figure 3.28. When\nthe water content increases, there is a progressive change from brittle to plastic\nbehaviour. For water contents lower than 8%, the stress\u2013strain curves present\na peak and the specimens seem strongly dilatant. On the other hand, for water\ncontents larger than 16%, perfectly plastic and slightly contractant behaviours\nwere observed. However, in all the tests, the volumetric deformations remained\nvery limited (1 to 1.5%). The authors claimed that in the first case, the negative\npore water pressure in the menisci creates strong bonds between the grains, that\nincrease the strength of the material and prevents it deformation. When the\nwater content increases, the grains begin to be surrounded by water, and the\nbehaviour of the soil tends towards that of the saturated soil at the same void\nratio.\n\nMoreover, interpretation of the triaxial tests results using Biarez et al. (1993)\nmicromechanical model for the definition of the effective stress was attempted.\nThe paths of unsaturated specimens were found to finish near the same maxi-\nmum strength criterion as the quasi\u2013saturated specimens.\n\nThe effect of initial water content on shear strength is clear from results\nobtained from drained direct shear tests on silty clay presented by Maaitah and\nMahadin (2004). In Figure 3.29a are shown the relationship between degrees\nof saturation and shear strength for three normal stresses. As the degree of\nsaturation increases up to 25% the shear strength increases and then it becomes\nnearly constant between degree of saturation 25 to 50%. As the saturation\nincreases more than 50% the shear strength decreases. Maaitah (2005) explains\nthis behaviour on the basis of bulk\u2013water regulated behaviour and menisci\u2013water\nregulated behaviour. The effect of initial void ratio on unsaturated strength\nwas also investigated. As illustrated in Figure 3.29b, to a decrease in void ratio\ncorresponds an increase in shear strength. This is also confirmed by Fleureau\net al. (2003) results. Differences decreased for low and high degrees of saturation.\n\nFurther, Maaitah (2005) analysed some of the results in the light of the\ncritical states (Wood, 1990) and compared with saturated drained tests. The\nunsaturated critical state lines in the plane (q,p) were found to be parallel to\n\n\n\nHydro\u2013mechanical behaviour 71\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 3.28: (a) Stress deviator versus axial strain for consolidated undrained\ntests on unsaturated specimens of Perafita sand; (b) Interpretation of large\ntriaxial tests using Biarez et al.

Four series of samples were\nprepared by static (series 1, 2 and 4) and dynamic compaction (series 3). The\ncompaction details for series 1\u20134 are shown in Figure 3.31a.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 3.29: (a) Shear strength versus degree of saturation for initial void ratio\nof 0.8; (b) Effect of initial void ratio on unsaturated strength (Maaitah and\nMahadin, 2004)\n\nControlled\u2013suction triaxial tests were carried out at constant suction. For\neach value of suction no significant influence of compaction conditions, namely,\nwater content and compaction energy, was observed on the location of the crit-\nical state line in the (q,p\n\n?\n\n) plane. At critical states it seems that unsaturated\ncritical sate lines are parallel to saturated critical state line in the (q,p\n\n?\n\n) plane\n(fig. 3.31b) and interception with q is a function of suction according the Equa-\n\n\n\n72 The influence of compaction on the hydro\u2013mechanical behaviour\n\nFigure 3.30: p\u2013q diagram for unsaturated and saturated specimens with void\nratio of 0.68 (Maaitah, 2005)\n\ntion 3.27. Hence, the angle of internal friction at the critical state appears to be\nindependent of the soil suction. Experimental data from Mancuso et al. (2002)\nand Wang et al. (2002) confirms that the slope of critical state line of the un-\nsaturated studied materials at different suctions are parallel on the (q,p\n\n?\n\n) plane\nto the saturated critical state line for a silty sand and a silty soil, respectively.\n\nq(s) = M \u00b7 p\n?\n\n+ \u00b5(s) (3.27)\n\nwhere M is the slope of of critical state line and \u00b5(s) is the value given by the\ninterception of critical state line with q.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 3.31: (a) Compaction details for series 1\u20134 and the curves of standard\nProctor compaction and 400 kPa static compaction (Sivakumar and Wheeler,\n2000); (b) Critical state data in the plane (q,p) for series 1, 2 and 3 (Wheeler\nand Sivakumar, 2000)\n\nIn contrast, Estabragh and Javadi (2008) reported that slope of critical state\nline in the (q,p) plane is suction dependent and decreases with increasing suc-\ntion. On the investigation of a silty soil, they found that critical state lines at\ndifferent suctions are not parallel and, on the conducted experiments, meet each\nother at a point with a mean net stress of about 950 kN (fig. 3.32a). Figures\n3.32b and 3.32c shows the variation of M(s) and \u00b5(s) with suction. It appears\nthat the value of M(s) decreases with increasing suction, whereas \u00b5(s) follows\n\n\n\nHydro\u2013mechanical behaviour 73\n\nan inverse trend, although not in a linear fashion as assumed by Alonso et al.\n(1990).\n\n(a)\n\n(b) (c)\n\nFigure 3.32: (a) Critical state line for q and p\n?\n\nunder various suctions; (b)\nVariation of M(s) with suction; (c) Variation of \u00b5(s) with suction (Estabragh\nand Javadi, 2008)\n\nWith respect to critical state line in the plane (v,p\n?\n\n), accordingly to Wheeler\nand Sivakumar (2000), compaction pressure had no apparent effect on the re-\nlationship at this plane, suggesting that any differences in initial fabric caused\nby increased compaction pressure are erased by shearing to a critical state.\nHowever, molding water content appears to affect the critical state line at this\nplane, suggesting that differences in soil fabric produced by compaction at dif-\nferent water contents are not completely erased even by shearing to a critical\nstate. They state that a possible explanation lies in the two levels of soil fabric\nwithin samples compacted dry of optimum: the macrostructural arrangement of\nlarge clay packets and interpacket voids, and the microstructure within individ-\nual packets. The critical states observed in triaxial tests probably correspond\nto shearing of the macrofabric to a critical state, whereas the relatively strong\nmicrofabric of individual clay packets may not reach a critical state, so that the\ninfluence of the initial fabric is not completely erased. As so, Equation 3.28\ndefines the critical state line in the (v,p\n\n?\n\n).\n\nv(s) = ?(s) ? ?(s) \u00b7 ln(p) (3.28)\n\nOn the other hand, Mancuso et al. (2002) and Estabragh and Javadi (2008)\nreached different results from experimental data. For the studied materials the\ncritical state values of v appear to fall on a unique critical hyperline for each\n\n\n\n74 The influence of compaction on the hydro\u2013mechanical behaviour\n\nvalue of suction and were nearly parallel (fig. 3.33). However, Estabragh and\nJavadi (2008) reported that the position and the slope of the critical state line\nat zero suction (saturated condition) were very different to those of the critical\nstate lines for unsaturated soil samples. These trend is also contrary to the\nmodel presented by Alonso et al. (1990).\n\nFigure 3.33: Variation of specific volume (v) and mean net stress at critical\nstate condition (Estabragh and Javadi, 2008)\n\nConcerning to the influence of compaction technique, Wheeler and Sivaku-\nmar (2000) concluded that a change from static to dynamic compaction, with\nno change in compaction water content or compaction induced dry density, had\nno apparent effect on subsequent material behaviour. This was consistent with\nthe fact that there was no influence on behaviour under isotropic stress states.\n\n3.4 Summary\n\nThis chapter reviews basic concepts related to the hydro\u2013mechanical behav-\nior of unsaturated geomaterials where suction plays a fundamental role. In turn,\nsuction is influenced by water content whose relationship can be described by\nthe soil water characteristic curve (SWCC), also known as soil water retention\ncurve (WRC). Then is presented the effective stress concept for saturated geo-\nmaterials, contrasting with the effective stress concept for unsaturated geomate-\nrials. With regards to unsaturated geomaterials two approaches are commonly\nused in the literature: effective stress approach and independent state variable\napproach. In this investigation the effective stress approach was used.\n\nThis chapter focus on the influence of compaction conditions (water con-\ntent, compaction energy and compaction technique) on the hydro\u2013mechanical\nbehaviour of saturated and unsaturated geomaterials is reviewed. It is presented\nthe state of the art on the water retention curve, stiffness, compressibility and\nstrength of unsaturated soils found in published literature about the topics. The\nhydro\u2013mechanical behaviour of unsaturated geomaterials is not straightforward\ndue to the presence of suction and, even at critical states, the results found on\nliterature are contradictory.\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nExperimental program\n\n4.1 Introduction\n\nThe experimental program is developed in three parts, namely, a laboratory\ntest campaign, a full scale trial performed on a railway embankment and another\ntrial carried out in a road embankment.\n\nThe execution of these trials was greatly conditioned by the impossibility to\nfully perform the initially planned work, in the aim of a cooperation protocol\nbetween the National Railway Network (REFER) and four national research\ninstitutions (University of Minho, UM; National Laboratory of Civil Engineer-\ning, LNEC; New University of Lisbon, FCT/UNL; and Technical University of\nLisbon, IST) to develop the knowledge concerning the methodology for the con-\nstruction and control of the railway embankments and rail track layers for high\nspeed trains. This was established under the framework of a national research\nproject POCI/ECM/61114/2004, entitled \u201cInteraction soil\u2013rail track for high\nspeed trains\u201d, financed by the Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT).\nIn this protocol was planned:\n\n- Execution of a trial embankment to establish a methodology of construc-\ntion for optimization of embankments performance;\n\n- Construction and observation of two definitive railway embankments, one\nbuilt according to traditional technologies of construction and control, and\nanother built according with the new technologies of construction and con-\ntrol. During the construction of definitive embankments instrumentation\nand monitoring during and post construction would be done. This would\nallow comparison of performances from the two embankments, as well as\neventual comparison with numerical models developed in this context.\n\nIn the aim of this protocol it was only possible to perform the trial embank-\nment, which is called hereafter E?vora Trial Railway Embankment (ETRE).\n\nHowever, another contract between the Centre for Waste Valorisation (CVR)\nand Portuguese Steel Companies (SN), including University of Minho, allows to\nobtain more knowledge about this subject also under the framework of another\nNational Research program founded by FCT. In fact, a trial road embankment\nwas constructed, giving the possibility to carry out different studies using spot\n\n75\n\n\n\n76 Experimental program\n\nand continuous compaction control tests, as well as the instrumentation of the\nembankment and road layers to measure vibrations and strains induced by the\ncompaction equipment and load traffic. Hereafter this trial embankment is\nreferred to as Fafe Trial Road Embankment (FTRE).\n\nAdditionally to the fields tests and monitoring of the embankment trials a\nlaboratory tests program was performed. It was intended to characterize the\nmaterials and to support modeling behaviour of materials and the interpretation\nof field tests in a more phenomenological way.\n\nThe experimental program adopted will be described in the following main\nsections:\n\n- Laboratory investigation;\n\n- E?vora trial railway embankment (ETRE);\n\n- Fafe trial road embankment (FTRE).\n\n4.2 Laboratory investigation\n\nThe laboratory investigation involved the study of five materials: Clayey\nsand (SC), Crushed aggregate 0/31.5 (CA31.5), Poor\u2013graded silty sand (SP),\nInert Steel Aggregate for Construction (ISAC) and Crushed aggregate 0/40\n(CA40).\n\nHowever, in the scope of this thesis only SC and CA31.5 were object of a\nlaboratory investigation, namely, physical, hydro and mechanical characteriza-\ntion. Therefore, a detail description of the tests carried out on these materials\nwill be presented. Concerning the remaining materials, these were studied in\nthe aim of another doctoral thesis (Reis Ferreira, 2010). It is worth to note that\nthese materials were employed in trial embankments.\n\n4.2.1 Physical characterization\n\nSC and CA31.5 materials were first subject to identification tests, grain\nsize distribution, Atterberg limits, Specific Gravity, Methylene Blue Adsorption\nmethod, Sand Equivalent test, and Standard and Modified Proctor tests. A list\nof tests is presented in Table 4.1.\n\nTable 4.1: Identification and compaction tests performed on SC and CA31.5\n\nTest SC CA31.5\nGrain size distribution \u00d7 \u00d7\nAtterberg limits \u00d7 \u2013\nSpecific Gravity \u00d7 \u00d7\nMethylene Blue \u00d7 \u00d7\nSand Equivalent \u00d7 \u00d7\nStandard Proctor \u00d7 \u2013\nModified Proctor \u00d7 \u00d7\n\n\n\nLaboratory investigation 77\n\n4.2.2 Hydro characterization\n\nThe hydro characterization (suction\u2013water content relationship) was carried\nout only for SC material. State conditions were defined in order to provide\ninformation about the influence of the variation of moisture content on the\nbehaviour of studied materials. The specimens were compacted to 97% of the\nmaximum dry density of Modified Proctor, i.e., to the same void ratio, by means\nof a vibrating hammer, over the range of following molding water contents:\n\n- 4 % dry of optimum (wOPM?4%);\n\n- 2 % dry of optimum (wOPM?2%);\n\n- optimum (wOPM);\n\n- 2 % wet of optimum (wOPM+2%).\n\nIt is noteworthy that this molding water contents covers the range of the\nmoisture contents employed in field investigation, which will be described in\nfollowing main sections.\n\nAs mentioned in Chapter 3, the filter paper technique was employed to mea-\nsure matric suction of SC specimens. The inicial negative pore water pressure\n(under ?3 = 0) was controlled by means of calibrated filter papers Whatman\n#42, ashless quantitative Type II, with a diameter of 9 cm. In this technique,\nafter compaction, two initially dry filter papers were placed on the top and\nbottom of the specimens. The outer filter papers were used for suction mea-\nsurement, while the filter papers in contact with the specimen were used to\nprotect the outer filter papers from soil fouling or contamination. To ensure\ngood contact between the specimen and the filter papers and to make easier to\nmanage the set, specimen and filter papers were sandwiched by acrylic plates\nand then wrapped up in a plastic foil. After that, the set is placed in a airtight\nplastic bag and stored inside an temperature controlled cabin. Then, the filter\npapers and the soil specimen moisture content were allowed to equilibrate.\n\nAn equilibrium period of at least 14 days was allowed for the specimens,\nfilter paper, and the air in the sealed container to reach equilibrium. At the\nend of the equilibration period, the filter papers were removed from the soil\nspecimen, and the wet mass of the outer filter papers were measured with a\nhigh precision balance with 0.0001g accuracy. The measurement process was\ncompleted within a few seconds to avoid moisture loss from the filter papers.\nSubsequently, filter paper and soil were oven\u2013dried at 110?C for 24 hours. The\nmoisture contents of each were individually determined. The equilibrium filter\npaper water content of the specimen was then converted to matric suction values\nby calibration curve (Bicalho et al., 2011).\n\nSeries of tests were conducted over the range of molding water contents pre-\nviously defined. At each series corresponding to a given molding water content,\nthree tests were carried out. The state parameters of each test are given in\nTable 4.2.\n\nThe specimen preparation procedure is the same for all samples. Each one is\nmixed up with the right quantity of water and it is placed in a sealed plastic bag\nfour 24 hours to achieve uniform moisture conditions. After the hydric equilib-\nrium period is reached specimens were compacted with a vibrating hammer in\na cylindrical mould with 100 mm in diameter. During compaction process the\n\n\n\n78 Experimental program\n\nTable 4.2: Filter paper method performed on SC\n\nw [%] e S [%]\nwOPM?4% 4.6 0.342 35.6\n\n4.6 0.332 36.7\n4.7 0.329 37.8\n\nwOPM?2% 6.0 0.329 48.3\n6.9 0.335 47.5\n6.9 0.331 47.2\n\nwOPM 9.3 0.319 77.4\n9.4 0.322 77.4\n9.4 0.334 74.5\n\nwOPM+2% 11.6 0.321 95.8\n11.9 0.323 97.4\n11.5 0.320 95.3\n\nspecimen height was controlled by the time of vibration in order to obtain the\nfixed dry density. With this purpose, specimens with 100 mm in diameter and\n25 mm high were prepared.\n\n4.2.3 Mechanical characterization\n\nMechanical characterization was carried out on specimens in unsaturated\nconditions and in the small and large strain domain, involving oedometer tests,\ntriaxial tests and triaxial tests in a stress\u2013path Bishop\u2013Wesley triaxial chamber\nwith measurement of S\u2013waves velocity. In addition, tests in dry or saturated\nconditions were performed as reference tests. In Table 4.3 are presented the\ntests performed on SC and CA31.5.\n\nTable 4.3: Mechanical tests carried out on SC and CA31.5\n\nMaterial Specimens state conditions Mechanical tests\nMolding water\ncontent\n\nSaturation\ncondition\n\nType of test\n\nSC wOPM?4% unsaturated TXM \u2013 \u2013 TXS OE\nwOPM?2% unsaturated TXM \u2013 \u2013 TXS OE\nwOPM unsaturated TXM TX \u2013 TXS OE\nwOPM saturated TXM TX \u2013 \u2013 OE\nwOPM+2% unsaturated TXM \u2013 \u2013 TXS \u2013\nwdry unsaturated TXM \u2013 \u2013 TXS \u2013\n\nCA31.5 wOPM?2% unsaturated TXM \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nwOPM unsaturated TXM \u2013 TXI \u2013 \u2013\nwOPM saturated TXM \u2013 TXI \u2013 \u2013\nwdry unsaturated TXM \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nNote: TXM \u2013 Triaxial multistage test; TX \u2013 Triaxial test; TXI \u2013 Triaxial isotropic\n\ntest; TXS \u2013 Triaxial tests in a stress\u2013path Bishop\u2013Wesley triaxial chamber with\n\nmeasurement of S\u2013waves velocity; OE \u2013 Oedometer test\n\n\n\nLaboratory investigation 79\n\nOedometer test\n\nIn order to study the compressibility of SC material under unsaturated\nand saturated conditions the oedometer test was performed (UNE 103\u2013405\u201394,\n1994). Conventional oedometer equipment and procedures for incremental load-\ning were used. A series of load increments and decrements were applied and the\nsettlement was recorded continuously. The series of load increments and decre-\nments are: 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 500, 1000, 500, 200, 100 kPa. Previous\nto the first load increment a preload was applied not exceeding 3 kPa. After the\nfinal decrement the final moisture content of the sample was determined.\n\nIn Table 4.4 are summarized the conducted tests and respective state pa-\nrameters. One test with high value of void ratio was performed to determine\nthe intrinsic properties of the soil.\n\nTable 4.4: Oedometer tests performed on SC\n\nw [%] e S [%]\nwOPM?4% 5.1 0.341 39.6\nwOPM?2% 6.6 0.335 51.9\nwOPM 8.5 0.322 70.0\nwOPM 8.8 0.633 36.8\nwOPM sat 8.8 0.339 68.7\n\nThe specimens preparation procedure is similar to all the type of tests. How-\never, in this particular case, before material mix up with the right quantity of\nwater, first, it was sieved to avoid the presence of coarse grains (maximum sixe:\n4.75 mm). This was due to the high of the oedometer ring, with dimensions of\n19.6 mm high and 70 mm in diameter.\n\nAfter the hydric equilibrium period, compaction was performed in the same\nmold used for the preparation of all other specimens, with 100 mm in diameter.\nThe mass of material was placed together with the oedometer ring inside the\nmold. Once again, the time of vibration was that necessary to obtain the desir-\nable volume. This procedure was adopted since it has the advantage that only\nthe top of the specimen contained in the oedometer ring needs to be trimmed\nflush.\n\nTriaxial test procedures\n\nTriaxial testing is commonly used to quantify the shear strength of a geo-\nmaterial, and procedures for such testing are well established. Nevertheless, to\nobtain maximum information from a limited number of tests and to eliminate\nthe effect of soil variability, a multistage testing procedure was attempted (Ho\nand Fredlund, 1982; Reis Ferreira, 2010). Thus, triaxial tests were conducted\nusing three stages corresponding to isotropic consolidation stresses of 100, 200\nand 300 kPa.\n\nThe method consists of applying an isotropic stress of 100 kPa corresponding\nto the first stage of testing and the sample is allowed to consolidate. Once no\nfurther sample volume change can be detected, the sample is in equilibrium with\nthe applied isotropic stress. After consolidation is complete, the minor principle\nstress (?3) is maintained while the sample is loaded at a constant strain rate. A\n\u201ccyclic loading\u201d procedure was adopted in testing the sample, as illustrated in\n\n\n\n80 Experimental program\n\nFigure 4.1. The deviator stress was applied until it was apparent that the stress\nwas reaching a peak value. At this point, the vertical load was \u201cbacked\u2013off\u201d\nthe sample. After that, a new set of stress corresponding to the second stage\n(?3 = 200 kPa) is applied to the sample, consolidation is again allowed, and\nthe loading process is repeated as before. For the last stage, corresponding to\n?3 = 300 kPa, the deviator stress is applied until the critical state is reached.\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\nAxial strain [%]\n\nD\ne\n\nvi\na\n\nto\nr \n\nst\nre\n\nss\n, \nq\n\n [\nkP\n\na\n]\n\nFigure 4.1: Example of a multistage test result\n\nAs mentioned before (see Table 4.3), besides unsaturated tests, also dry and\nsaturated triaxial tests were performed as reference tests. In addition, triaxial\ntests with only one stage, corresponding to ?3 = 300 kPa, and isotropic triaxial\ntests were carried out in order to allow comparison with the last stage of the\nmultistage tests and so, to evaluate if results are influenced by the multistage\nprocedure.\n\nIn all triaxial tests, the drainage system remained open. In Tables 4.5 and\n4.6 are summarized the triaxial tests conducted on each studied material and\nrespective state parameters.\n\nTable 4.5: Triaxial CD tests performed on SC specimens with 100 mm \u00d7 200 mm\n\nw [%] e S [%] Type of test Minor principle\nstress, ?3 [kPa]\n\nwOPM?4% 5.0 0.339 39.1 multistage 100, 200, 300\nwOPM?2% 6.9 0.333 55.3 multistage 100, 200, 300\nwOPM 9.1 0.342 70.5 multistage 100, 200, 300\nwOPM iso 9.8 0.344 75.4 one stage 300\nwOPM+2% 10.8 0.336 85.1 multistage 100, 200, 300\nwdry 0.0 0.336 0.0 multistage 100, 200, 300\nwOPM sat 8.8 0.334 69.9 multistage 100, 200, 300\nwOPM iso sat 8.9 0.339 69.5 one stage 300\n\nThe specimen preparation procedure is identical for both materials.

After that,\nall specimens are compacted by a vibrating hammer. The time of vibration was\nthat necessary to obtain the fixed dry density.\n\nTo perform triaxial tests on SC, specimens with 100 mm in diameter and\n200 mm high were prepared. After the hydric equilibrium period is reached, in\n\n\n\nLaboratory investigation 81\n\nTable 4.6: Triaxial CD tests performed on CA31.5 specimens with 150 mm \u00d7\n300 mm\n\nw [%] e S [%] Type of test Minor principle\nstress, ?3 [kPa]\n\nwOPM?2% 3.8 0.217 47.7 multistage 100, 200, 300\nwOPM 5.5 0.226 66.3 multistage 100, 200, 300\nwdry 0.0 0.217 0.0 multistage 100, 200, 300\nwOPM sat 5.9 0.225 71.0 multistage 100, 200, 300\nw1% sat 1.4 0.221 17.8 multistage 100, 200, 300\nwOPM iso 5.5 0.226 66.3 isotropic 10, 25, 50, 100,\n\n200, 300, 400\nwOPM iso sat 5.9 0.234 68.7 isotropic 10, 25, 50, 100,\n\n200, 300, 400\nwOPM iso sat 5.8 0.454 34.9 isotropic 10, 25, 50, 100,\n\n200, 300, 400\n\norder to get the best possible standard homogeneity, compaction was performed\nin four layers, each one with the same mass of material, in a 100 mm diameter\ncylindrical mould. For the first layer of 50 mm compression was performed\nuntil the desire volume was reached. The other three layers were successively\ncompacted on the top of the previous one using the volume criterion. The\ninterface between the different layers were carefully scarified in order to provide\ngood bonding between them.\n\nThe same procedure was adopted for CA31.5. However, due to material\ngrain size, specimens with 150 mm in diameter and 300 mm high were prepared.\nThese were compacted in six layers using the same mass of material for each\none.\n\nA conventional strain\u2013controlled triaxial press was used to perform triaxial\ntests. The loading rate of 0.03 mm/min for compression was adopted, which\ncorresponds to 0.015% and 0.010% strain per minute for specimens with 200 mm\nhigh and 300 mm high, respectively. The vertical strain was confirmed by means\nof an external displacement transducer. Conventional triaxial cells were also\ninstrumented with a load cell, located just above the top cap inside the triaxial\ncell in order to eliminate piston friction effects. Also, two pressure transducers\nand two volume controllers were used, one to control the pressure\u2013volume of the\nfluid in the cell and the other to control the pressure\u2013volume of the sample (for\nsaturated tests).\n\nTriaxial tests with measurement of S\u2013waves velocity. Setup and pro-\ncedures\n\nA series of tests using bender elements and accelerometers was carried out\nwith the purpose to get data in the small strain domain.\n\nOnce no chamber was prepared to incorporate bender\u2013extender elements,\nit was necessary to adapt an existing one. Therefore, the system design was\ninfluenced by the characteristics of equipment and sensors available in the Lab-\noratory of Civil Engineering at the University of Minho. For the development\nof this system, a Bishop\u2013Wesley stress\u2013path chamber was used and adapted to\n\n\n\n82 Experimental program\n\naccommodate the bender\u2013extender elements and the accelerometers.\nWith regard to bender\u2013extender elements, two bottom and top sensors and\n\none lateral sensor were available. However, only the bottom and top sensors\nto be installed on the platens were used. New bottom and top platens were\ndesigned and manufactured and modifications in stress\u2013path chamber, including\ndrilled holes for cable outlet, were made, as illustrated in Figure 4.2. In Figure\n4.3 top and bottom platens are presented with embedded bender\u2013elements. It\nis worth to note that each platen is composed of two parts. This solution was\ndetermined by the fact that the sensors are equipped with original cables and\nplugs that were not changed in order to preserve the quality of transmitted\nsignals. The bender\u2013extender elements used in this work were manufactured\nby GDS Instruments (2011) and allow transmission of P\u2013waves and S\u2013waves.\nHowever, only measurement of S\u2013waves were performed. This was due to the\nmaximum limit of the acquisition frequency rate allowed by the acquisition\nequipment used, which does not enable measurement of P\u2013waves.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 4.2: Holes on stress\u2013path Bishop\u2013Wesley triaxial chamber to incorporate\ncables: (a) inside view; (b) lateral view\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 4.3: (a) Bottom and (b) top platens with embedded bender\u2013elements\n(Ferreira et al., 2010)\n\nConcerning to accelerometers, two sensors whose physical characteristics, in-\ncluding the mass and dimension, allow the installation on the side of the sample\nwere available. To measure the soil vibrations on the sides of the specimen it\nshould be guaranteed adequate coupling to the specimen, so that is ensured the\n\n\n\nLaboratory investigation 83\n\nsensors horizontality and stability during measurements. Thus, sensors were\nfixed to the sides of the specimens at specific points, by means of designed pins\nscrewed to the back of the accelerometers. After specimen placement on the\nstress\u2013path cell, pins are spiked into the specimen. This involves drilling the\nmembrane and, therefore, careful isolation of the hole must be guaranteed. The\naccelerometers, from Bru?el and Kj\u00e6r, are piezoelectric sensors type 4513\u2013001,\nwith sensivity of 100 mV/g, measure range of \u00b1 50 g, a frequency range between\n1 and 10 kHz, with dimensions of 12.7 mm in diamenter and 15.65 mm high and\napproximately 9 grams in weight (fig. 4.4).\n\nFigure 4.4: Accelerometer and pin (Ferreira et al., 2010)\n\nThe final setup is illustrated in Figure 4.5. The conceived testing system\ncomprises a total of four sensors: two bender-extender elements and two ac-\ncelerometers. The sensor located on the bottom platen is the transmitter BE\nthat sends seismic S\u2013waves, which travel through the specimen, and are received\nand recorded by the remaining transducers, the receiver BE and the accelerom-\neters.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 4.5: Bender elements and accelerometers setup: (a) scheme; (b) view\n(adopted from Ferreira et al. (2010))\n\nThe associated electronics equipment consists of two main components: a\nfunction generator from Thurlby Thandar Instruments (TG1010A model) and\na National Instruments data logger system (SCXI\u20131600), with 16\u2013bit accelerom-\neter cards (SCXI\u20131531), connected to a portable computer. The function gen-\nerator produces the output signal in the form of a sine pulse to a transmitting\nbender element with the maximum amplitude allowed by the equipment (\u00b110 V)\n\n\n\n84 Experimental program\n\nin order to enhance the response of the bender element\u2013soil system. Data acqui-\nsition was performed at the maximum allowed by equipment (200 kHz), that is\nto say, a frequency of 50 kHz per channel, which corresponds to a ?t = 0.00002s.\nThe portable computer was used to display and collect the signals.\n\nA specific LabVIEW interface was developed for data acquisition and record-\ning. The program operates similarly to an oscilloscope: triggered signals are\ndetected and an average of 16 pulses, which are stacked to improve signal\u2013to\u2013\nnoise ratio, is displayed. In addition, each channel can be individually amplified\nby a user\u2013defined factor, as shown in Figure 4.6.\n\nFigure 4.6: Sample display of acquisition program developed in LabVIEW\n\nTriaxial tests with measurement of S\u2013waves velocity were conducted only\non SC specimens. The test consisted in three phases. Firstly, measurements of\nS\u2013waves velocity were performed without application of stresses (?3 = 0 kPa) on\nspecimens. Secondly, specimens were submitted to isotropic stresses, namely, 25,\n50, 100 kPa, and consolidation was allowed. For each stage measurement of S\u2013\nwaves velocity were conducted. Finally, similarly to triaxial tests, a multistage\ntesting procedure was adopted, using three stages corresponding to isotropic\nconsolidation stresses of 100, 200 and 300 kPa. However, the deviator stress was\napplied until approximately 30% of the peak value at each stage. This was due\nto constraints on the air pressure system. Besides unsaturated tests with the\nprevious defined state parameters, also a dry isotropic test was performed. In\nTable 4.7 is summarized the triaxial tests program with the state parameters\nfor each specimen.\n\nSC specimens dimensions and preparation procedure are similar to the ones\npreviously described for standard triaxial tests. Likewise, the loading rate of\n0.03 mm/min for compression was adopted, which corresponds to 0.015% strain\nper minute. This was possible through the implementation of a control system\ndeveloped by Arau?jo (2007).\n\nA load cell located just above the top cap inside the triaxial cell and a\npressure transducer to control pressure of the fluid inside the cell were used.\n\n\n\nField investigation: E?vora trial railway embankment (ETRE) 85\n\nTable 4.7: Triaxial tests with measurement of S\u2013wave velocity performed on SC\nspecimens with 100 mm \u00d7 200 mm\n\nw [%] e S [%] Type of test Minor principle\nstress, ?3 [kPa]\n\nwOPM?4% 4.7 0.331 37.6 isotropic 0, 25, 50, 100\nmultistage 100, 200, 300\n\nwOPM?2% 6.8 0.333 54.0 isotropic 0, 25, 50, 100\nmultistage 100, 200, 300\n\nwOPM 8.8 0.334 69.9 isotropic 0, 25, 50, 100\nmultistage 100, 200, 300\n\nwOPM+2% 10.8 0.337 84.9 isotropic 0, 25, 50, 100\nmultistage 100, 200, 300\n\nwdry 0.0 0.332 0.0 isotropic 0,100, 200, 300\n\nNo volume controllers were used in this type of test. This was due to the\nimplementation of the accelerometers, which are not prepared to work under\nwater. To this end, air was used instead of water for application of confining\npressures. Volume change was estimated from triaxial tests volume change\ncurves.\n\n4.3 Field investigation: E?vora trial railway em-\n\nbankment (ETRE)\n\nUnder the framework of a national research project mentioned previously,\na protocol between the Portuguese National Railways Network (REFER) and\nand four national research institutions (UM, LNEC, FCT/UNL, and IST) was\nestablished, which focused the following main objectives:\n\n- Establishment of a methodology of construction for optimization of em-\nbankments performance;\n\n- Development of a specification of the plate loading test to be used as a\nreference method;\n\n- Methodology for calibration of dynamic plate loading tests, like Falling\nWeight Deflectometer (FWD), Soil Stiffness Gauge (SSG), Spectral Anal-\nysis Surface Waves (SASW) and others;\n\n- Application of continuous compaction control by different tools (like Por-\ntanceme?tre and integrated compaction control) and methodology for cal-\nibration;\n\n- Establishment of a methodology for quality control of compacted layers\nby using spot methods and continuous approach.\n\nTo reach the goal, a trial embankment was constructed with the cooperation\nof REFER, MOTA\u2013ENGIL and GEOCONTROLE. This one took place near the\nnew railway line between \u201cSines\u201d and \u201cCaia\u201d, in section \u201cCasa Branca \u2013 E?vora\u201d\n\n\n\n86 Experimental program\n\nat PK 106+800, about 2.5 km from the \u201cMonte das Flores\u201d railway station, and\nrunning tests between October and November of 2006.\n\nAn experimental program was established consisting on the employment of\ndifferent materials and on the in situ evaluation of physical and mechanical\nproperties.\n\n4.3.1 Materials\n\nTwo type of materials were tested: SC for the embankment layers and\nCA31.5 for the sub\u2013ballast layer, as shown in Figure 4.7.\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c) (d)\n\nFigure 4.7: ETRE: (a) SC layer; (b) CA31.5 material over SC layer; (c) and\n(d) general overview of SC and CA31.5 trial layers\n\n4.3.2 Experimental plan\n\nIn order to fulfill the main objectives established on the protocol an ex-\nperimental plan was developed involving optimization of thickness layers con-\nstructed over a range of different moisture contents, for different energy levels\ncorresponding to the passes of the compaction equipment. A Caterpillar CS\u2013\n583D smooth drum vibratory roller was used during investigation, which is\nclassified as V4 accordingly to LCPC/SETRA (1992). For each energy level,\nthe behaviour of trial layers, with different thicknesses and moisture contents,\nwere then evaluated by means of field tests.\n\n\n\nField investigation: E?vora trial railway embankment (ETRE) 87\n\nGeometry\n\nTrial layers were planned to be constructed with dimensions in plant of\n50 m length and 6 m width. Then a mesh was created in order to establish the\nlocation to run field tests. This consisted in dividing width into lanes with 2 m\n(A, B, C) and length into columns with 5 m (1 to 10), thus, resulting grids with\ndimensions 5\u00d72 m2. For each grid a set of field tests would be conducted to\nevaluate physical and mechanical properties of the trial layer, for each energy\nlevel applied. In Figure 4.8 is shown the adopted mesh. It should be noted\nthat lanes A and C, were provided for all types of tests, while lane B was only\nsubject to non\u2013destructive tests.\n\nFigure 4.8: Mesh created for ETRE trial layers with dimensions of 50\u00d76 m2\n\nHowever, due to space and time constraints, not all layers were constructed\nas initially planned. Some layers were constructed with half of the length (25 m)\nand/or were constructed over another layers, instead over foundation.\n\nTaking into account the optimization of trial layers thicknesses, these were\ndefined accordingly to the ones commonly used with the studied geomaterials.\nFor SC trial layers thicknesses of 0.30, 0.40 and 0.50 m were employed, while for\nCA31.5 trial layers thicknesses of 0.22 and 0.30 m were employed.\n\nMoisture conditions of materials\n\nAfter geometry definition, moisture conditions were established. A range\nof three different moisture contents were employed on SC trial layers: (i) 2%\ndry of optimum (wOPM?2%); (ii) optimum (wOPM); (iii) 2% wet of optimum\n(wOPM+2%). Concerning to CA31.5 trial layers only optimum moisture content\n(wOPM) was employed. Moisture content was established in relation to modified\nProctor test for both geomaterials. The geometry and moisture conditions of\nthe trial layers are summarized on Table 4.8.\n\nConcerning to the water application, it is worth noting that the methodology\nadopted was similar to the one employed on embankment dams. To achieve\ndesirable moisture contents, materials were stack and water was added. Then\nmaterials were mixed up by means of a front shovel.\n\nIt should be pointed out that before the construction of the trial layers, su-\nperficial soils with poor quality were removed. An excavation of 0.60 m depth\nwas made within an area of approximately 2000 m2. In order to promote homo-\ngeneity of the support of the trial embankment, foundation with 0.60 m thickness\n\n\n\n88 Experimental program\n\nTable 4.8: Synthesis of the state conditions and geometric characteristics\nadopted on the trial embankment\n\nMaterial\ntype\n\nMoisture con-\ntent, w [%]\n\nThickness\n[m]\n\nDimensions\nof layers [m2]\n\nExecuted above\n\n0.30 50 \u00d7 6 Foundation\nwOPM?2% 0.40 25 \u00d7 6 0.30 wOPM?2%\n\nSC 0.50 50 \u00d7 6 Foundation\nwOPM 0.40 50 \u00d7 6 Foundation\nwOPM+2% 0.40 50 \u00d7 6 0.30 wOPM?2%\n\nand 0.40 wOPM\n\nCA31.5 wOPM 0.22 25 \u00d7 6 0.50 wOPM?2%\nwOPM 0.30 25 \u00d7 6 0.50 wOPM?2%\n\nwas compacted in two layers with 0.30 m thickness each, with moisture content\nin the dry side of the modified Proctor curve. Each layer was compacted with\nenergy level corresponding to twelve passes of the vibrating roller.\n\nField tests on trial layers\n\nTo evaluate the state conditions and mechanical properties of the several\nlayers, for different energy levels, the following fields tests were performed:\n\n- Sand cone method (SCM) performed by LNEC;\n\n- Nuclear method (NM) performed by LNEC;\n\n- Static Plate Load Test (SPLT) performed by UM;\n\n- Soil Stiffness Gauge (SSG) performed by LNEC;\n\n- Ligth Falling Weight Deflectometer (LFWD) performed by LNEC;\n\n- Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) performed by UM;\n\n- Spectral Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW) performed by UM;\n\n- Portanceme?tre performed by GEOCONTROLE.\n\nThe SCM and NM allow determination of state parameters, while the others\nenable determination of mechanical properties. As stated in Chapter 2, only\nPortanceme?tre allows continuous compaction control.\n\nThe experimental plan was established according to the mesh previously\ndefined and is illustrated in Figure 4.9. As mentioned previously, some trial\nlayers were constructed with half the length, i.e., 25 m instead of 50 m. In these\ncases, only half of the experimental plan was carried out. It should be noted\nthat in lanes A and C, the Portanceme?tre passes were done after the SPLT\ntests. Each layer was tested for different energy levels corresponding to 4, 6,\n8, 10 and 12 passes of the vibrating roller. Exceptions must be made to some\ntests, which were not performed due to either time and/or weather constraints.\n\nIn Tables 4.9 to 4.12 a summary of the number of spot tests conducted is\nmade according to type of geomaterial and moisture content.\n\n\n\nField investigation: E?vora trial railway embankment (ETRE) 89\n\nFigure 4.9: Experimental plan adopted on ETRE for layers with dimensions of\n50\u00d76 m2\n\nWith regards to SPLT, whenever the number of tests are presented as, for\nexample, 8 + 5, it means that were conducted 8 tests following AFNOR standard\nand 5 tests following DIN standard (recall Chapter 2). Concerning the remaining\ntests, whenever the number of tests are presented as, for example, 4 + 2?, it\nmeans that 6 tests were conducted, 2 of which were done at the same spot\nwhere SPLT were performed.\n\nTable 4.9: Number of tests conducted on SC trial layers with moisture content\n?opt?2%\n\nLayer No. of SCM NM SPLT SSG LFWD\npasses\n\n0.30 m 4 4 10 4 10 8\n6 4 + 2? 7 2 8 8\n8 4 8 4 8 8\n10 4 8 2 8 8\n12 4 + 2? 8 5 + 5 8 8 + 4?\n\n0.40 m 4 \u2013 6 \u2013 5 4\n6 \u2013 5 \u2013 5 5\n8 \u2013 5 \u2013 5 5\n10 \u2013 5 \u2013 5 \u2013\n12 2 + 2? 5 + 3? 5 + 4 5 + 4? 6?\n\n0.50 m 4 4 8 4 8 8\n6 4 8 2 8 8\n8 4 9 4 9 3\n10 4 8 2 8 9\n12 4 8 5 + 5 8 7 + 4?\n\nConcerning to continuous compaction control by mean of Portanceme?tre,\ntests were performed in every layers and for all energy levels corresponding to\n4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 passes of the vibrating roller.\n\n\n\n90 Experimental program\n\nTable 4.10: Number of tests conducted on SC trial layers with moisture content\n?opt\n\nLayer No. of SCM NM SPLT SSG LFWD FWD SASW\npasses\n\n0.40 m 4 1 1 \u2013 8 8 \u2013 \u2013\n6 4 8 \u2013 8 8 \u2013 \u2013\n8 4 8 4 8 8 + 4? \u2013 \u2013\n10 4 9 4 8 8 + 3? \u2013 \u2013\n12 \u2013 8 8 + 5 8 8 + 4? 2 2\n\nTable 4.11: Number of tests conducted on SC trial layers with moisture content\nwOPM+2%\n\nLayer No. of SCM NM SPLT SSG LFWD\npasses\n\n0.40 m 4 4 8 4 8 7 + 4?\n\n6 \u2013 8 \u2013 8 7\n8 4 8 4 8 8\n10 \u2013 8 \u2013 8 8\n12 4 + 2? 8 + 3? 5 + 5 9 + 4? 8 + 6?\n\nTable 4.12: Number of tests conducted on CA31.5 trial layers with moisture\ncontent ?opt\n\nLayer No. of SCM NM SPLT SSG LFWD\npasses\n\n0.22 m 4 6 5 \u2013 5 5\n6 \u2013 5 \u2013 5 5\n8 \u2013 5 \u2013 5 5\n10 \u2013 5 \u2013 5 5\n12 \u2013 5 + 5? 5 + 5 5 + 10? 5\n\n0.30 m 4 6 5 \u2013 5 5\n6 \u2013 5 \u2013 5 5\n8 \u2013 5 \u2013 5 5\n10 \u2013 5 \u2013 5 5\n12 \u2013 5 + 5? 5 + 5 5 + 10? 5\n\n4.4 Field investigation: Fafe trial road embank-\n\nment (FTRE)\n\nIn the aim of a national research project POCI/ECM/56952/2004, entitled\n\u201cApplication of waste in transportation infrastructures and geotechnical con-\nstructions \u2013 Re-use of steel slags\u201d financed by the Foundation for Science and\nTechnology (FCT), the Portuguese Steel Companies (SN) required Centre for\nWaste Valorisation (CVR) to conduct an experimental field study with the goal\nto validate/calibrate in situ the results obtained in laboratory for the processed\nsteel slag, actually named Inert Steel Aggregate for Construction (ISAC) pro-\nduced in the Portuguese Steel Companies.

The work and tests run between\nOctober and November of 2007.\n\nLikewise in ETRE, an experimental plan was established to evaluate physical\nand mechanical properties of the trial road embankment. Besides behaviour\nevaluation, vibrations measurements were performed during the execution of\nroad layers.\n\n4.4.1 Materials\n\nThe construction plan consisted on the the employment of ISAC with the\npurpose of in situ validation/calibration of results obtained in laboratory for\nISAC geomaterial. To meet this goal, also traditional materials were employed,\nnamely SP and CA40, in such a way to allow comparison between ISAC and tra-\nditional geomaterials. In Figure 4.10 are illustrated the geomaterials employed\nand a general view of the trial road embankment.\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c) (d)\n\nFigure 4.10: FTRE: (a) SP material; (b) ISAC material; (c) and (d) general\noverview of SC and ISAC trial layers\n\n\n\n92 Experimental program\n\n4.4.2 Experimental plan\n\nAn experimental plan was established in order to fulfill three main objec-\ntives: (i) execution of trial layers to optimize thickness layer and energy level\ncorresponding to the passes of the vibrating roller, while state conditions remain\nconstant; (ii) evaluate materials behaviour during execution of trial, embank-\nment and road layers; (iii) measurements of vibrations of the roller drum, as well\nas vibrations and compression vertical strains of the capping layer due to appli-\ncation of dynamic loads, during and after compaction process. A Hamm 3412\nsmooth drum vibratory roller was used during investigation, which is classified\nas V3 accordingly to LCPC/SETRA (1992).\n\nGeometry\n\nThe construction plan consisted in three sections, each one with 10 m length,\nwith different configurations adopted regarding the employment of ISAC and\ntraditional materials, as illustrated in Figure 4.11. The three configurations\nwere the following:\n\n1. One only employing traditional materials, SP on embankment and capping\nlayers and CA40 on base layer;\n\n2. One employing SP on embankment and capping layers and ISAC on base\nlayer;\n\n3. One employing ISAC on embankment, capping and base layers.\n\nFigure 4.11: Construction scheme of the FTRE\n\nAll sections had the same width corresponding to the width of the embank-\nment. Similarly to the experimental plan adopted on ETRE, a mesh was created\nin order to establish the location to run field tests. This consisted in dividing\neach layer into two lanes, named hereafter left side (LS) and right side (RS),\nand into columns with 5 m width (0 to 7), as illustrated in Figure 4.12. For each\ngrid a set of field tests would be conducted to evaluate physical and mechanical\nproperties of the trial layer, for each applied energy level.\n\nAs mentioned above, the construction process developed in three phases.\nFirstly, a trial embankment was constructed using ISAC and SP. In this phase,\ntrial layers with thicknesses 0.30 (1st layer), 0.40 (2nd layer) and 0.50 m (3rd\n\nlayer) were constructed (fig. 4.13). State conditions and mechanical properties\n\n\n\nField investigation: Fafe trial road embankment (FTRE) 93\n\nFigure 4.12: Mesh created for FTRE trial layers\n\nwere then evaluated for different energy levels corresponding to the passes of the\nvibrating roller. The main goal was to optimize thickness of the embankment\nlayers and energy level, i.e., the number of passes of the vibrating roller. Sec-\nondly, construction of the embankment layers, the capping layer and the base\nlayer were carried out with 0.40 (4th to 7th layer), 0.40 and 0.20 m thicknesses,\nrespectively. Finally, bituminous layers were constructed with a total thickness\nof 0.14 m.\n\nFigure 4.13: Construction scheme of the FTRE trial layers\n\nMoisture contents of materials\n\nFor all materials optimum content, in relation to Modified Proctor, was\nadopted. The water application followed similar procedure to ETRE. However,\nmoisture content was corrected on the embankment ever a deviation was verified\nfrom NM results.\n\nField tests on trial layers and embankment layers\n\nAn experimental plan was established to evaluate the behaviour of trial lay-\ners and of the embankment and road layers. The following in situ tests were\nperformed:\n\n- Sand cone method (SCM) performed by LEC\u2013UM;\n\n- Rubber balloon method (RBM) performed by LNEC;\n\n- Nuclear method (NM) performed by LEC\u2013UM;\n\n\n\n94 Experimental program\n\n- Static Plate Load Test (SPLT) performed by LEC\u2013UM;\n\n- Benkelman beam deflection measurement (BBDM) performed by LEC\u2013\nUM;\n\n- Soil Stiffness Gauge (SSG) performed by LNEC;\n\n- Ligth Falling Weight Deflectometer (LFWD) performed by LNEC;\n\n- Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) performed by LEC\u2013UM;\n\n- Spectral Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW) performed by LEC\u2013UM;\n\n- Portanceme?tre performed by GEOCONTROLE.\n\nThe experimental plan was established according to the mesh previously\ndefined and is illustrated in Figure 4.14. Concerning to trial layers, each one\nwas tested for different energy levels corresponding to 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14\npasses of the vibrating roller. Exceptions must be made to some tests, which\nwere not performed due to either time and/or weather constraints. Regarding\nthe remaining layers, tests were performed for the last energy level.\n\nFigure 4.14: Experimental plan adopted on FTRE\n\nIn Tables 4.13 to 4.18 a summary of the number of spot tests conducted is\nmade for the several layers, according to the type of material.\n\nLikewise to ETRE, whenever the number of tests are presented as, for ex-\nample, 4 + 2?, it means that were conducted 6 tests, 2 of which were done at\nthe same spot where SPLT were performed.\n\nConcerning to continuous compaction control by mean of Portanceme?tre,\ntests were performed in every layers and for all energy levels corresponding to\n4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 passes of the vibrating roller.\n\n4.4.3 Instrumentation of experimental section\n\nAs stated previously, the instrumentation of the experimental sections aimed\nthe measurement of vibrations of the roller drum, as well as vibrations and\ncompression vertical strains of the capping layer due to application of dynamic\nloads, during and after compaction process. It was intended to get data in order\nto investigate the interaction between roller drum and layer to be compacted, as\nwell as to realize the magnitude of strains induced during application of dynamic\n\n\n\nField investigation: Fafe trial road embankment (FTRE) 95\n\nTable 4.13: Number of tests conducted on SP trial layers\n\nLayer No. of SCM NM SPLT SSG LFWD BBDM\npasses\n\n0.30 m 4 2 6 \u2013 6 6 \u2013\n(1st layer) 6 2 6 \u2013 6 6 \u2013\n\n10 2 6 \u2013 6 6 \u2013\n0.40 m 4 2 6 \u2013 6 6 \u2013\n(2nd layer) 6 2 6 \u2013 6 6 \u2013\n\n8 2 6 \u2013 6 6 \u2013\n10 2 6 \u2013 6 6 \u2013\n12 2 6 2 \u2013 6 + 2? 2\n\n0.50 m 4 \u2013 5 \u2013 3 \u2013 \u2013\n(3rd layer) 6 \u2013 6 \u2013 6 6 \u2013\n\n10 \u2013 6 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n12 \u2013 6 \u2013 \u2013 6 \u2013\n14 \u2013 6 \u2013 6 6 \u2013\n\nTable 4.14: Number of tests conducted on SP embankment and capping layers\n\nLayer No. of NM SSG LFWD SASW\npasses\n\n0.40 m 8 3 \u2013 6 \u2013\n(4th layer) 10 6 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n0.40 m 8 \u2013 \u2013 6 \u2013\n(5th layer) 10 6 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n0.40 m 8 6 \u2013 6 \u2013\n(6th layer) 10 3 \u2013 3 \u2013\n0.40 m 8 6 \u2013 6 \u2013\n(7th layer)\n0.40 m 8 6 6 6 1\n(capping\nlayer)\n\nTable 4.15: Number of tests conducted on CA40 base layer\n\nLayer No. of SPLT STLT SSG LFWD FWD\npasses\n\nBase layer 8 1 2 4 5 6\n\nloads with several equipments, such as, FWD, LFWD, the Portanceme?tre and\nduring application of static loads while performing SPLT.\n\nIn this sense, an experimental plan was developed involving measurements\nin two sections of the embankment, one executed with ISAC material and the\nother with traditional SP material, as illustrated on Figure 4.15.\n\nIn order to fulfill these requirements, the instrumentation plan was divided\nin two setups: one to be employed during compaction of the capping layer and\nanother to be employed during and after compaction process of the base layer.\nThese plans are illustrated in more detail in Figures 4.16 and 4.17.\n\n\n\n96 Experimental program\n\nTable 4.16: Number of tests conducted on ISAC trial embankment layers\n\nLayer No. of RBM NM SPLT SSG LFWD BBDM\npasses\n\n0.30 m 4 2 4 \u2013 4 4 \u2013\n(1st layer) 6 2 4 \u2013 4 4 \u2013\n\n10 2 4 \u2013 4 4 \u2013\n0.40 m 4 1 4 \u2013 4 4 \u2013\n(2nd layer) 6 2 4 \u2013 4 4 \u2013\n\n8 2 4 \u2013 4 4 \u2013\n10 \u2013 4 \u2013 4 4 \u2013\n12 1 4 1 \u2013 4 + 2? 2\n\n0.50 m 4 \u2013 3 \u2013 2 \u2013 \u2013\n(3rd layer) 6 \u2013 4 \u2013 4 4 \u2013\n\n10 \u2013 4 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n12 \u2013 4 \u2013 \u2013 4 \u2013\n14 \u2013 4 2 4 4 + 1? \u2013\n\nTable 4.17: Number of tests conducted on ISAC embankment and capping\nlayers\n\nLayer No. of NM SSG LFWD FWD\npasses\n\n0.40 m 8 2 \u2013 2 \u2013\n(4th layer) 10 4 \u2013 4 \u2013\n0.40 m 8 4 \u2013 2 \u2013\n(5th layer) 10 \u2013 \u2013 4 \u2013\n\n12 3 \u2013 2 \u2013\n0.40 m 10 4 \u2013 4 \u2013\n(6th layer) 12 2 \u2013 2 \u2013\n0.40 m 10 4 \u2013 4 \u2013\n(7th layer)\n0.40 m 10 4 2 2 \u2013\n(capping\nlayer)\n\n12 4 2 2 2\n\nTable 4.18: Number of tests conducted on ISAC base layer\n\nLayer No. of SPLT STLT SSG LFWD FWD\npasses\n\nBase layer 10 1 4 6 4 4\n\nAs can be seen in Figures 4.16 and 4.17, sensors were placed on the same\nvertical and horizontal alignments, so the results of both sensors can be related.\nIn both setups two type of sensors were used:\n\n- accelerometers for the measurement of vertical vibrations;\n\n- strain gauges for measurement of vertical strains.\n\n\n\nField investigation: Fafe trial road embankment (FTRE) 97\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 4.15: Schematic position of instrumentation zone on FTRE: (a) plant;\n(b) longitudinal view\n\nFigure 4.16: Instrumentation with accelerometers and strain gauges during com-\npaction of the capping layer\n\nHowever, their is a slightly difference between the setups adopted. As illus-\ntrated in Figure 4.16, during compaction of the capping layer, two accelerome-\nters and one strain gauge placed in depth were used in each section. No strain\ngauges near surface of the capping layer were used since vibration of the roller\ncould damage these sensors. Instead, one accelerometer was used near sur-\nface. At the same time, based on some experiences conducted (Rinehart and\nMooney, 2008), two accelerometers were employed on the roller drum to mon-\nitor the vibrations experienced by the equipment during compaction, i.e., its\n\n\n\n98 Experimental program\n\nbehaviour during compaction process. After compaction, FWD, LFWD and\nPortanceme?tre were carried out on each section enabling the measurement of\nvibrations and vertical strains induced by each test.\n\nFigure 4.17: Instrumentation with accelerometers and strain gauges during com-\npaction of the base layer\n\nBefore the execution of the base layer, the accelerometer near the surface of\nthe capping layer was removed and replaced by two strain gauges. Once the\nsensors employed in these setup would be unrecoverable, only one accelerometer\nwas used in each section, since these are more expensive. Thereby, the resulting\nsetup in each section consisted in one accelerometer and three strain gauges,\nas shown in Figure 4.17. Furthermore, two accelerometers were embarked on\nthe roller drum and vibrations were recorded during compaction process. In\naddition, vertical strains were measured during SPLT in each section after com-\npaction.\n\n4.5 Conclusions\n\nIn this chapter the experimental program adopted was described. This was\ndeveloped in three main parts, namely, laboratory investigation, and two field\ninvestigations corresponding to E?vora trial railway embankment (ETRE) and\nFafe trial road embankment (FTRE).\n\nRegarding laboratory investigation, five geomaterials, which were employed\nin the field investigation, were studied (clayey sand (SC), crushed aggregate\n(CA31.5), poor\u2013graded sand (SP), inert steel aggregate for construction ISAC\nand another crushed aggregate (CA40)). However, in the scope of this thesis\nonly the first two ones, SC and CA31.5, were subjected to a laboratory inves-\ntigation and, therefore, a detail description of the tests carried out on these\nmaterials were conducted. Concerning the other materials, these were studied\nin the aim of a doctoral thesis Reis Ferreira (2010).\n\nLaboratory investigation involved physical, hydro and mechanical charac-\nterization. Firstly, physical characterization was carried out. Secondly, hydro\ncharacterization was performed by means of filter paper method. In order to\nprovide information about the influence of the variation of moisture content\non the behaviour of studied materials, initial state conditions involved series of\n\n\n\nConclusions 99\n\ntests performed on specimens compacted to 97 % of the maximum dry density\nand over a range of molding water contents: 4 % dry of optimum (wOPM?4%),\n2 % dry of optimum (wOPM?2%), optimum (wOPM) and 2 % wet of optimum\n(wOPM+2%). This range includes the moisture contents employed in field in-\nvestigation. Finally, mechanical characterization was performed. Tests were\ncarried out in unsaturated, saturated and dry conditions and in the small and\nlarge strain domain, which included oedometer tests, triaxial tests and triax-\nial tests in a stress\u2013path Bishop\u2013Wesley triaxial chamber with measurement of\nS\u2013waves velocity. These tests were described in detail.\n\nConcerning to field investigation, two trial embankments were conducted:\nE?vora railway trial embankment ETRE; and Fafe road trial embankment FTRE.\n\nAn experimental program for field investigation on ETRE was developed\ninvolving optimization of thickness layers constructed over a range of different\nmoisture contents, for different energy levels corresponding to the passes of the\ncompaction equipment. SC and CA31.5 were employed on trial embankment.\nThe geometry of the layers were defined and a mesh was created in order to\nestablish the location to run field tests. Thicknesses of 0.30, 0.40 and 0.50 m,\nand 0.22 and 0.30 m were employed for SC and CA31.5 layers, respectively.\nThen, moisture conditions of materials were established over a range of three\ndifferent moisture contents: 2% dry ofoptimum (wOPM?2%), optimum (wOPM)\nand 2% wet of optimum (wOPM+2%). However, on CA31.5 trial layers only\noptimum moisture content (wOPM), was employed. At last, state conditions\nand mechanical properties of the several layers were evaluated by means of spot\nand continuous tests methods. These were conducted for different energy levels.\n\nSimilarly, an experimental program were established for field investigation\non FTRE. SP, CA40 and ISAC material were employed. The experimental plan\nsought three main objectives: (i) execution of trial layers to optimize thickness\nlayer and energy level corresponding to the passes of the vibrating roller, while\nstate conditions remain constant; (ii) evaluate materials behaviour during ex-\necution of trial, embankment and road layers; (iii) measurements of vibrations\nduring and post compaction of the capping and base layer. Geometry including\nlayers with 0.30, 0.40 and 0.50 m thickness was defined and a mesh was created\nto establish the location to run field tests. Only optimum moisture content,\n(wOPM), was employed. Likewise to ETRE, state conditions and mechanical\nproperties of the several layers were evaluated by means of spot and continuous\ntests methods, which were conducted for different energy levels. Finally, a de-\nscription of the instrumentation of the capping layer using accelerometers and\nstrain gauges was carried out.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nLaboratory investigation\n\n5.1 Introduction\n\nA laboratory test campaign was carried out on reconstituted samples of two\ngeomaterials, a clayey sand (SC) and a crushed aggregate 0/31.5 (CA31.5),\nwhich, as mentioned previously, were employed in E?vora trial railway embank-\nment (ETRE). This study aimed to investigate the influence of compaction\nconditions on the mechanical behaviour of these materials. In this scope, void\nratio was fixed corresponding to 97% of the Modified Proctor and moisture con-\ntent was varied from 4% dry of optimum to 2% wet of optimum for SC and\nfrom 2% dry of optimum to optimum for CA31.5.\n\nIn this chapter, the most relevant results provided by the laboratory tests\nwill be presented according to the characterization type, namely, physical, hydro\nand mechanical and discussed in detail. The tests procedure and specimens state\nparameters were described in Chapter 4. One should bear in mind that analysis\nwill be performed in total stresses.\n\n5.2 Physical characterization\n\nAs mentioned above, two geomaterials were used in this study, a coarse\u2013\ngrained soil, clayey sand (SC), and a decomposed granite classified as a well\u2013\ngraded gravel with silt and sand (GW\u2013GM), accordingly to the Unified Soil\nClassification System (ASTM D2487, 2000). For the sake of simplicity, these\ngeomaterials are called herein as SC and CA31.5, respectively.\n\nThe grain\u2013size distribution curves of both materials are plotted in Figure 5.1,\nwhereas in Table 5.1 are given the index properties, namely, Atterberg Limits\n(NP 143, 1969); Specific Gravity (NP 83, 1965; EN 1097\u20136, 2000), Methylene\nBlue (NF P 94\u2013068, 1998; NP EN 933\u20139, 2002); Sand Equivalent (LNEC E 199,\n1967; NP EN 933\u20138, 2002), and compaction characteristics determined using\nModified Proctor (LNEC E 197, 1966; EN 13286\u20132, 2004).\n\n101\n\n\n\n102 Laboratory investigation\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n0.01 0.1 1 10 100\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nSC\n\nCA31.5\n\nP\ne\nrc\ne\nn\nt \nfi\nn\ne\nr \n[%\n]\n\nP\ne\nrc\ne\nn\nt \nre\nta\nin\ne\nd\n [\n%\n]\n\nParticle diameter [mm]\n\nFigure 5.1: Grain\u2013size distributions\n\nTable 5.1: Results from identification tests\n\nTest Material type\nSC CA31.5\n\nAtterberg Limits wL 32 \u2013\nwP 21 \u2013\nIP 11 \u2013\n\nSpecific Gravity 2.65 2.73\nMethylene Blue 0.96 1.25\nSand Equivalent 24 38\nModified Proctor ?d [kN/m\n\n3] 20.14 22.71\nw [%] 8.6 5.7\n\n5.3 Hydro characterization\n\nAs described in Chapter 4, the hydro characterization was carried out only\nfor SC material, using filter paper technique to measure matric suction. In\nFigure 5.2 is plotted the matric suction versus saturation degree for specimens\nwith similar void ratio, about 0.331. Three tests per saturation degree were\ncarried out in order to verify repeatability. The following calibtarion equation\nwas used (Chandler et al., 1992):\n\nLog10(suction) =\n\n{\n\n4.842 ? 0.0622 \u00b7 w if w &lt;47,\n6.050 ? 2.48 \u00b7 Log10(w) if w > 47\n\n(5.1)\n\nThe matric suctions obtained for the range of molding water contents from\n4% dry of optimum to 3% wet of optimum varied from 215 to 8 kPa, respectively.\nMatric suction was found to decrease with increasing saturation degree (Sr)\naccordingly to expression given in Figure 5.2. One note that there is a strong\npower relation with R2 = 0.991 between matric suction and saturation degree.\nRegarding to the molding water contents studied, 4% and 2% dry of optimum,\noptimum and 2% wet of optimum, the corresponding values of matric suction\nare approximatelly 170, 51, 21 and 11 kPa, considering void ratio e = 0.331.\n\n\n\nMechanical characterization 103\n\n20 40 60 80 100\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n2\n\n10\n3\n\ns = 29856007.85 S\nr\n?3.32\n\nR2 = 0.991\n\nSaturation degree, S\nr\n [%]\n\nM\na\n\ntr\nic\n\n S\nu\n\nct\nio\n\nn\n, \ns \n\n[k\nP\n\na\n]\n\n \n\n \n\nw\nOPM?4%\n\nw\nOPM?2%\n\nw\nOPM\n\nw\nOPM+2%\n\nFigure 5.2: Matric suction versus molding water content for SC specimens with\nthe same void ratio (e = 0.331)\n\n5.4 Mechanical characterization\n\n5.4.1 Oedometer test\n\nA series of one\u2013dimensional consolidation tests under unsaturated and satu-\nrated conditions were conducted to study compressibility behaviour of SC com-\npacted specimens. As listed in Chapter 4, one saturated and four unsaturated\nconsolidation tests were performed. Figure 5.3a shows three unsaturated tests\ninvolving compacted specimens with molding water content corresponding to\n4% dry of optimum (wOPM?4%), 2% dry of optimum (wOPM?2%) and optimum\n(wOPM), and a saturated test with optimum molding water (wOPM sat). Un-\nsaturated tests had approximately the same initial void ratio (e = 0.331), cor-\nresponding to 97% of Modified Proctor, whereas saturated test had a slightly\nlower initial void ratio (e = 0.322). In addition, an unsaturated test in a loose\nstate was carried out in order to obtain the virgin compression line (VCL), and\nis illustrated in Figure 5.3b. In Table 5.2 are given the coefficients of compress-\nibility (?c), considering a regression analysis with the last two points of the\nloading cycle, and the coefficients of unloading (?u) considering all points of the\nunloading cycle.\n\nTable 5.2: Coefficients of compressibility (?c) and of unloading (?u)\n\nSpecimen ?c ?u\nwOPM?4% 0.0289 0.0032\nwOPM?2% 0.0263 0.0030\nwOPM 0.0370 0.0034\nwOPM sat 0.0170 0.0037\nwOPM loose 0.0887 0.0043\n\nIn Figure 5.3a it can bee seen that the curves shapes exhibit non linear\nbehaviour. Despite specimens were submitted to maximum vertical stress of\n1000 kPa, one may observe that they did not achieved VCL. More points would\nbe necessary to better define the slope over a total vertical stress of 1000 kPa.\nThis notwithstanding, in the lower stress range, before yielding, the curves\nshapes are reasonably molding water content independent, which is the same\n\n\n\n104 Laboratory investigation\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n2\n\n10\n3\n\n1.24\n\n1.26\n\n1.28\n\n1.3\n\n1.32\n\n1.34\n\nTotal vertical stress, ?\n1\n [kPa]\n\nS\np\n\ne\nci\n\nfic\n v\n\no\nlu\n\nm\ne\n\n, \n1\n\n+\ne\n\nVCL\n\n(a)\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n2\n\n10\n3\n\n1.35\n\n1.4\n\n1.45\n\n1.5\n\n1.55\n\n1.6\n\n1.65\n\n1.7\n\nTotal vertical stress, ?\n1\n [kPa]\n\nS\np\n\ne\nci\n\nfic\n v\n\no\nlu\n\nm\ne\n\n, \n1\n\n+\ne\n\nVCL\n\n(b)\n\nwOPM?4% (w=5.1%; e=0.341) wOPM?2% (w=6.6%; e=0.335) wOPM (w=8.8%; e=0.337)\n\nwOPM sat (w=8.5%; e=0.322) wOPM loose (w=8.8%; e=0.633)\n\nFigure 5.3: Oedometer tests results from SC specimens in unsaturated and\nsaturated conditions in: (a) compacted state; (b) loose state\n\nto say suction independent. On the contrary, in the higher stress range after\nyielding, curves shapes from unsaturated specimens seems to be suction depen-\ndent: to lower molding water content corresponds smaller compressibility (?c),\ni.e., there is a decrease of the plastic compressibility with increasing suction. In\nfact, one can see from Table 5.2 that ?c are lower for driest specimens. How-\never, specimen wOPM?2% presents ?c slightly lower than corresponding value\nfrom wOPM?4%. This may be attributed to differences on initial void ratio,\nsince initial specific volume of specimen wOPM?2% is smaller than the others\nunsaturated ones, which are close together. This denotes the importance of\ndensity at high stress levels, which can be stronger than the suction effect and\nhide it. Indeed, ?c obtained from saturated specimen is the lowest, which ap-\npears to contradict previous findings since there is any suction contribution.\nNevertheless, the initial void ratio from saturated specimen is the lowest which\nstrongly influenced specimen compressibility. As so, as far as plastic compress-\nibility is concerned, the influence of suction and density are similar, since any\nincrease in either of these parameters reduces the compressibility.\n\nThe unloading sequences performed at all tests confirm the irreversible na-\nture of the strains. It is interesting noting that ?u for unsaturated specimens\nappears to be independent of the suction, since values around 0.0032 were de-\ntermined. Though specimen in saturated condition had lower initial void ratio,\nit exhibited similar swelling on the unloading cycle, where a ?u = 0.0037 was\nobtained. The unsaturated specimen in loose state allowed to determine the\nVCL. A ?c = 0.0887 and a ?u = 0.0043 were determined. One note that ?u\nis slightly higher than values achieved from compacted samples in unsaturated\ncondition.\n\nThe data confirm the general findings that an increased suction produces\na stiffening of the material with smaller plastic compressibility (Alonso et al.,\n1990; Cui and Delage, 1996), despite the tight differences observed between un-\nsaturated tests. Saturated test (zero suction) showed the lowest compressibility\n\n\n\nMechanical characterization 105\n\nwhich was due to a lower initial void ratio. Further, similar results are pro-\nduced by variation of suction and density, since any increase in either of these\nparameters reduces the compressibility. Regarding unloading cycle, it appears\nthat swelling is suction independent for unsaturated specimens.\n\n5.4.2 Triaxial tests on SC specimens\n\nTriaxial test results obtained from specimens under various molding water\ncontents, i.e., suction, are presented in Figures 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6, corresponding\nto confining stresses (?3) of 100, 200 and 300 kPa, respectively.\n\nA non linear behaviour is observed where an important strain component is\nunrecoverable. With decreasing molding water content the shape of the curves\ngradually changes and the maximum deviatoric stresses increases (figs. 5.4a,\n5.5a and 5.6a). An increasingly pronounced maximum is observed at a reducing\nstrain level, illustrating an increasing britleness of the material with decreasing\nmolding water content, i.e., increasing suction. However, as confining stress level\nincreases maximum deviatoric stresses occur at higher strain corresponding to\na reduction in britleness behaviour.\n\nThe influence of saturation condition on stress\u2013strain curve decreases with\nincreasing confining stress level. For optimum molding water content saturated\nspecimen exhibit slightly lower maximum deviatoric stress at ?3 = 100 kPa (fig.\n5.4a), whereas at ?3 = 200 kPa difference decreases (fig. 5.5a) and for the\nlast stage becomes slightly higher than corresponding value from unsaturated\nspecimen, which was unexpected. This fact is probably due to the multistage\ntest progress. Ho and Fredlund (1982) states that in a multistage test progress\nthe measured peak strength for a certain stage may be smaller than the peak\nstrength for the specimen under the same stress conditions in a single stage\ntest. The strength loss results from structure disturbance from previous stages.\nWith regards to wOPM unsaturated specimen, one can see that specimen ex-\nperimented great strain during previous stage (?3 = 200 kPa), as illustrated\nin Figure 5.5a. In fact, at that stage specimen reached deviatoric stress peak\nat strain about 3%, but specimen was allowed to deform until strain of 4.5%,\nwhich probably induced great structure disturbance. As a result, the measured\npeak strength for the last stage was smaller than would be expected. This be-\nhaviour is testified by the results obtained from two additional samples with\noptimum molding water content. In order to verify the influence of multistage\ntriaxial test procedure, these samples were submitted to saturated and unsatu-\nrated triaxial tests (wOPM iso sat and wOPM iso) in a single stage at ?3 = 300 kPa.\nStress\u2013strain curves of these two additional tests are plotted in Figure 5.6a. Al-\nthough greater plastic behaviour from single stage tests are observed, the peak\ndeviatoric stresses from one single stage and multistage saturated tests matches\nwell. Regarding unsaturated tests, peak deviatoric stresses do not agree and\nvalue obtained from one single stage test was greater than multistage test. As\nso, one may conclude that the smaller peak value obtained from multistage test\nwas due structure disturbance experimented at previous stages, namely at stage\ncorresponding to ?3 = 200 kPa.\n\nParticular results obtained from wdry and wOPM+2% specimen earn to be\ndiscussed apart. Dry specimen unexpectedly presented the highest strength,\nthus a second dry specimen was prepared and tested in order to confirm this\nresult.

The\nlower is the molding water content (the higher the suction) the larger is the di-\nlatancy. In fact, for water contents lower than wOPM, specimens seem strongly\ndilatant, as illustrated in Figures 5.4d, 5.5d and 5.6d. At the lower confining\nstress level (?3 = 100 kPa) all curves are well ordered and evolve regularly with\ndecreasing water content, i.e., increasing suction. In fact, the negative pore\nwater pressure in the menisci creates strong bonds between the grains, that\nincrease the strength of the material an prevents its deformation. When the\nwater content increases, the grains begin to be surrounded by water and the\nbehaviour of the soil tends towards that of the saturated soil at the same void\nratio. Further, at remaining confining stress levels it is noteworthy that speci-\nmen wOPM?2% was slightly dilatant than wOPM?4%. A reduction of contraction\nand dilatancy is also observed. These facts indicate that, at higher confining\nstress levels (?3 = 200 kPa and ?3 = 300 kPa), confining stress appears to has\nmajor influence on material behaviour than suction.\n\nFor the last confining stress level samples were loaded until stabilization of\nstress\u2013strain and volume change curves were observed, i.e., until critical state\nwas reached. Though critical state was not reached for all samples due to\nmembrane rupture, one can see from Figure 5.6a that all curves tend to the\nsame stress at larger strains, with exception to dry specimen. From volume\nchange curves and dilatancy (figs. 5.6c and 5.6d) critical state seems to had\nbeen reached in wOPM sat, wOPM iso and wOPM iso sat tests.\n\nConcerning to specimens deformability, in Figures 5.4e and 5.4f, 5.5e and\n5.5f and 5.6e and 5.6f one can observe an increasing secant and tangent moduli\nare associated to decreasing water content. Moreover, moduli increases with in-\ncreasing confining stress, as would be expected, though relative increase between\nstages become smaller. Once again, this fact denotes that increasing confining\nstress appears to reduce suction effect.\n\nIn Figure 5.7 are plotted the peaks deviatoric stress (q) versus mean total\nstress (p) obtained from each test, as well as the residual deviatoric stress corre-\nsponding to critical states. As would be expected for drained tests on specimens\nin dense state, yielding first occurs with q/p > M. Continued deformation is\nassociated with plastic softening and decrease of stress ratio until a perfectly\nplastic critical state is reached with q/p = M (Wood, 1990). The peak failure\nenvelope is also represented for each test, which relation can be written as in\nequations 5.2 and 5.3.\n\nqpeak = Mpeak \u00b7 p + c (5.2)\n\nqcs = Mcs \u00b7 p (5.3)\n\nwhere Mpeak and Mcs are the slope of the peak and critical state failure envelope,\n\nrespectively, and c is effective cohesion, c\n?\n\n, or apparent cohesion, capparent.

One should note that the lowest and highest ?peak (31.5 and 39.3\n\n?),\ncorrespond to wOPM and wOPM+2% tests, respectively. These bound values can\nbe attributed to multistage procedure. As above mentioned, peak results from\nwOPM specimen were affected by excessive shear strain in the second stage,\nleading to structure disturbance of specimen as the multistage tests progressed.\nAs a result, the measured peak deviatoric stress for the last stage (i.e., stage\n?3 = 300 kPa) may actually be smaller than that obtained from a specimen un-\nder the same stress conditions, using a single stage test. In fact, this hypothesis\nwas testified with single stage test carried out on wOPM iso unsaturated speci-\nmen, as illustrated in Figure 5.7. Hence, if wOPM iso peak value is considered\non the determination of ?peak, a value of 35\n\n? is obtained. In Table 5.3 this\nhypothesis is identified as wOPM\n\n?. As aforementioned, results from wOPM+2%\nspecimen should be treated with caution. To sum up, one can conclude that\nMpeak and ?peak obtained from unsaturated test results are similar.\n\nA Mcs of 1.38 was obtained corresponding to a ?cs = 34.1\n?. This value is in\n\nagree with the range of values given by Bowles (1970) for a silty sand in a dense\nstate. The highest ?peak was obtained from dry specimen (wdry), which reflects\nthe higher britleness of specimen in that state condition. The wOPM?4% and\nwOPM?2% tests showed the highest capparent, which seems to reflect the higher\nsuction of these samples. As water content approaches saturated condition, a\nreduction of capparent is observed, reflecting a suction decrease.\n\nThe evolution of secant friction angle (?sec) with total mean stress is repre-\nsented in Figure 5.7b. On one hand, one can observe that, for identical total\nmean stress, ?sec increases with decreasing molding water content. On the other\nhand, for the same specimen, ?sec values decrease with increasing mean stress,\n\n\n\nMechanical characterization 111\n\nTable 5.3: Peak and critical state failure envelope parameters Mpeak, Mcs and c\nand respective internal friction angle (?) obtained from triaxial multistage tests\n\nSample M c ?

This shows the great influence of both molding water\ncontent and total mean stress on ?sec values. Moreover, at higher total mean\nstress ?sec values get closer and seems to tend to ?sec value at critical state,\nwhich is consistent with de Beer (1965) investigations on granular materials in\na dense state. It should be noted that non linearity of ?sec with total mean\nstress leads to an apparent cohesion in the q,p plane (see Table 5.3) which has\nonly a mathematical meaning resulting from the interception of strength peak\nenvelope on q axis.\n\nThe evolution of specific volume with total mean stress (p) at the end of\nconsolidation at each stage of a multistage test and during consolidation of the\nsingle stage test are plotted in Figure 5.8. The effect of molding water content on\ncompressibility is investigated. Further, in order to investigate the influence of\nthe anisotropy induced by a multistage test, comparison is made with the results\nof the isotropic stress applied during consolidation of the single stage test. For\neach test the isotropic/anisotropic and peak consolidation line are defined by\nEquation 5.5, where ? represents the specific volume corresponding to a total\nmean stress of 1 kPa and ? is the slope.

As so, one may conclude that compressibility increases\nwith increasing molding water content, as previously verified from oedometer\ntests. Concerning to peak slopes (?peak) the same trend is observed, reflecting,\ntherefore, the initial molding water content. Moreover, it is interesting noting\nthat ? corresponding to saturated tests are higher than the ones for correspond-\ning unsaturated tests, i.e, compressibility is higher for saturated samples, which\ndenotes the influence of unsaturated conditions. Concerning to results from\nsingle and multistage tests, ? for wOPM and wOPM iso unsaturated tests, respec-\ntively, are quite similar. In contrast, a greater difference between ? for wOPM sat\nand wOPM iso sat saturated tests is observed. Regarding the effect of anisotropy\ninduced by multistage triaxial tests these results are inconclusive.\n\nIn Figure 5.8b critical state line is also plotted. From theory (Wood, 1990)\ncritical state line lies parallel to VCL obtained from oedometer, yet offset to the\nleft passing through critical state given by triaxial tests. As would be expected\nall points appears to lie on the left side of critical state line, i.e, in the dry side,\nwhich features granular geomaterials in dense sate (Wood, 1990). Exception is\nmade to dry specimen.\n\nIn order to get a better insight on the influence of compaction conditions\non specimens deformability, firstly, Esec is normalized for the same void ratio\naccordingly to Equation 5.6, where f(e) is a void ratio function given in Equation\n5.7 (Hardin and Richart, 1963).\n\nE\nnor\n\nsec = Esec \u00b7\nf(e = 0.331)\n\nf(e)\n(5.6)\n\nf(e) =\n(2.17 ? e)2\n\n(1 + e)\n(5.7)\n\n\n\nMechanical characterization 113\n\nSecondly, in Figure 5.9 E\nnor\n\nsec is plotted against axial stress and moisture con-\ntent. An axial strain of 0.5% and 1.0% were considered taking into account\nthe triaxial tests precision with external measurement. An increasing E\n\nnor\n\nsec with\nincreasing axial stress is observed following a power law accordingly to Equa-\ntion 5.8, where C is a stiffness coefficient and n is a stiffness index (Hoque and\nTatsuoka, 1998; Gomes Correia et al., 2001). In Table 5.5 are summarized the\nC and n parameters. It is should be noted that values gathered from triax-\nial tests carried in a single stage (wOPM iso and wOPM iso sat) lie below values\nobtained from multistage tests.

This trend is shown in Figure 5.9b for ?1 = 500 kPa and ?1 = 1000 kPa\nand is consistent with results from similar investigations (Fleureau et al., 2003).\n\n\n\n114 Laboratory investigation\n\nAs specimen moisture content approaches saturated condition Esec decreases\nand appears to remain constant beyond optimum moisture content. The same\ntrend is found concerning to axial strain of 1.0%. However, differences are\nsmaller reflecting the higher degradation of Esec at this strain level. With in-\ncreasing strain level the stiffness index (n) approaches unity, which value corre-\nsponds to perfect plasticity (Biarez et al., 2005).\n\nIn Figure 5.9c is shown the relation Esec0.5%/Esec1.0% for both ?1 = 500 kPa\nand ?1 = 1000 kPa. It is noteworthy that relation seems fairly constant as mois-\nture increases beyond optimum value for both stress levels, corresponding to\nabout 1.7, which is quite similar to relation obtained from normalised degrada-\ntion curve given by Ishibashi and Zhang (1993). In what concerns to specimens\nwith lower moisture content, i.e, higher suction, relation tends to increase and\nbecomes more pronounced for lower stress levels, which is the same to say that\nas stress level increases there is a reduction of suction effect on deformability.\n\nTable 5.5: Power law C and n parameters corresponding to regressions on\nEsec,?1 plane determined from SC triaxial tests for ? = 0.5% and ? = 1.0%\n\nSpecimen ? = 0.5% ? = 1.0%\nC n C n\n\nwOPM?4% 3.571 0.537 0.241 0.840\nwOPM?2% 1.497 0.651 0.332 0.794\nwOPM 0.648 0.752 0.279 0.804\nwOPM+2% 0.141 0.958 0.072 0.985\nwOPM sat 0.440 0.802 0.146 0.892\nwdry 0.318 0.877 0.141 0.922\n\nFurther, in Figure 5.10 are presented the E\nnor\n\nsec / E0 degradation curves for\neach confining stress stage. In addition, a reference threshold shear strain given\nby Santos (1999) for sandy soils was converted in a threshold modulus strain\nand plotted too. This conversion was done considering Poisson ratios of 0.10\nand 0.35 corresponding to strain levels of about 10?6 and greater than 10?2,\nrespectively. The E0 values were obtained from unsaturated triaxial tests using\nbender elements, which results will be presented afterwards. The normalized\ndegradation curves appears to fit reasonably the threshold modulus strain. The\ninfluence of moisture content, i.e., suction, on normalized degradation curves\nconfining stress is clearly marked. As confining stress increases, differences\nbetween degradation curves become smaller. Therefore, as seen previously, as\nstress level increases there is a reduction of suction effect on deformability.\n\n5.4.3 Triaxial tests on CA31.5 specimens\n\nLikewise to SC results, in Figures 5.11, 5.12 and 5.13 are presented CA31.5\ntriaxial tests results at confining stresses (?3) of 100, 200 and 300 kPa, respec-\ntively, obtained from specimens under different molding water contents, i.e.,\ndifferent suction.\n\nA non linear behaviour is observed for all confining stress stages (figs. 5.11a,\n5.12a and 5.13a) where an important strain component is unrecoverable (figs.\n5.11a and 5.12a).

At\nthe last stage (?3 = 300 kPa) stress\u2013strain curves show peak deviatoric stress\nfor all tests results which features stress\u2013strain behaviour of granular materi-\nals at a dense state (5.13a). It is noteworthy that unsaturated sample wOPM\npresents the highest deviatoric stress at all stages, whereas maximum deviatoric\nstress reached from unsaturated sample wOPM?2% lies between optimum satu-\nrated and unsaturated specimens (wOPM sat and wOPM). Therefore, at the state\nconditions studied, a higher suction effect seems to not be associated to a lower\nmolding water content as verified previously for SC material. This is probably\ndue to the low fine content, which is about 6% (see fig. 5.1).\n\nFrom volume change curves (figs. 5.11c, 5.12c and 5.13c) contraction follow-\ning by dilation is observed, which features granular materials in a dense state.\nVolumetric contraction is appreciably the same for all tests, but is achieved\nat a reduced strain level with successive stages, thus denoting an increasing\nbritleness, as seen previously from stress\u2013strain behaviour analysis. Unexpect-\nedly, saturated samples showed higher dilatancy than unsaturated ones at stages\n?3 = 100 and 200 kPa (figs. 5.11d and 5.12d), yet an inverse behaviour is ob-\nserved at the last stage (fig. 5.13d).

Results from saturated specimens (w1% sat\nand wOPM sat) were found to be identical too, where ?peak of 43.8 and 43.3\n\n? were\nobtained. As so, little differences on strength were found whether from satu-\nrated or unsaturated specimens and, therefore, one may conclude that suction\nhas little effect on material strength for the studied state conditions. Taking\ninto account the negligeable fraction of material passing on sieve no. 200 (about\n6%), to some extent, this conclusion would be expected. Moreover, results from\nsaturated specimens (wOPM sat and w1% sat) indicate that fabric did not played a\nsignificant role on samples strength. The highest ?peak was obtained from wdry\nspecimen, reflecting the higher britleness of specimen in that state condition.\nCritical states seems to had been reached only in wOPM sat test. A Mcs of 1.67\nwas obtained corresponding to a ?cs = 40.8\n\n?.\nIn Figure 5.7b is presented the secant friction angle (?sec) versus total mean\n\n\n\n120 Laboratory investigation\n\nstress. Likewise to SC material, ?sec values decrease with increasing total mean\nstress. However the highest are obtained from wOPM specimen, whereas corre-\nsponding values obtained from wOPM?2% specimen are lower, thereby, confirm-\ning conclusions about suction effect reached on previous paragraph. Though\nsaturated specimens were prepared in different manner, they present identical\n?sec values, which are the lowest.\n\nThe evolution of specific volume with total mean stress (p) at the start\nof each stage is shown in Figure 5.15 in order to investigate the influence of\nthe anisotropy induced by a multistage test. These results are compared with\nisotropic triaxial tests carried out in order to study compressibility of CA31.5\nmaterial, as listed in Chapter 4. The parameters ? and ? for each test are given\nin Table 5.7. One can see that slopes from anisotropic and isotropic compression\nlines differs significantly. As so, anisotropy induced by multistage triaxial tests\nseems to be significant. Relation regarding peak values could not be established.\nIt is interesting noting that wOPM iso unsaturated specimen showed greater com-\npressibility than corresponding saturated specimen, though the opposite would\nbe expected. This notwithstanding, differences on slopes are small, thus suction\neffect appears to have little influence on compressibility. In Figure 5.15b is plot-\nted the specific volume against total mean stress concerning specimen wOPM iso\nin loose state from which virgin compression line was determined.\n\nIn Figure 5.15a critical state line is also plotted. From theory (Wood, 1990)\ncritical state line lies parallel to VCL obtained from isotropic triaxial test, yet\noffset to the left passing through critical state given by triaxial tests. As would\nbe expected all points lie on the left side of critical state line, i.e, in the dry\nside, which features granular geomaterials in dense sate (Wood, 1990).\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n2\n\n10\n3\n\n10\n4\n\n1.18\n\n1.2\n\n1.22\n\n1.24\n\n1.26\n\n1.28\n\nIsotropic\nAnisotropic\n\nPeak\n\nCritical\nstate (cs)\n\nVCL\n\nTotal mean stress, p [kPa]\n\nS\np\n\ne\nci\n\nfic\n v\n\no\nlu\n\nm\ne\n\n, \n1\n\n+\ne\n\n(a)\n\n10\n0\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n2\n\n10\n3\n\n1.35\n\n1.38\n\n1.41\n\n1.44\n\n1.47\n\n1.5\n\nVCL\n\nTotal mean stress, p [kPa]\n\nS\np\n\ne\nci\n\nfic\n v\n\no\nlu\n\nm\ne\n\n, \n1\n\n+\ne\n\n(b)\n\nwOPM?2% (w=3.8%; e=0.217) wOPM (w=5.5%; e=0.226) wOPM sat (w=5.9%; e=0.225) wOPM cs\n\nw1% sat (w=1.4%; e=0.221) wdry (w=0.1; e=0.217) wOPM iso (w=5.5%; e=0.226) wOPM iso sat (w=5.9%; e=0.234)\n\n (w=5.9%; e=0.234) wOPM iso sat loose (w=5.8%; e=0.454)\n\nFigure 5.15: Specific volume vs. total mean stress obtained from SB triaxial\ntests: (a) isotropic, anisotropic at the start of each stage of a multistage test\nand at peak; (b) wOPM unsaturated specimen on loose state\n\nLikewise to SC test results analysis, the influence of compaction conditions\non specimens deformability is investigated.

A similar analysis is conducted to an axial\nstrain of 1%, but for stress level domain between ?1 = 1000 kPa and ?1 =\n2000 kPa. Parameters C and n show no significant differences on specimens\nstiffness, which trend is exhibited in Figure 5.9b. Finally, in Figure 5.9c is shown\nthe relation Esec0.5%/Esec1.0% considering ?1 = 1000 kPa, where a relation\nabout 1.75 is found.

In what follows, a brief description of interpretation of BE and\naccelerometers signals is made and results obtained from measurements of S\u2013\nwaves velocity with bender elements and accelerometers will be presented.\n\nInterpretation of BE and accelerometers signals\n\nThe interpretation of the BE and accelerometers data was performed in\ntime domain. Wave velocities were calculated using the travel length and time\nmeasured during the triaxial tests. In Figure 5.17 typical signals of BE and\naccelerometers are shown. These signals used as example result from a triaxial\ntest carried out on wOPM unsaturated specimen. The identification of the ar-\nrival time of the shear waves is not obvious, since they are often advanced by\ndirect and reflected compressional waves (Appendix A). With regards to BE,\nthe first deflection point recorded can be erroneously taken as the first wave\narrival, however it is caused by near field effect, hence cannot be considered\nto correspond to the real shear wave arrival time. The arrival time of shear\nwaves was then assumed to be located in the point of maximum curvature of\nthe recorded response curve, which are marked in Figure 5.17 as point BE (in-\n\n\n\nMechanical characterization 123\n\nput signal) and point BE\n?\n\n(output signal). Note that the polarity of the input\nand output signals is positive, hence the start of the shear wave is expected to\nbe ascending.\n\nIf the same assumption is made for accelerometers signals, the points marked\nas Ac\n\n?\n\n(output signals) in Figure 5.17 would correspond to arrival time of shear\nwaves. However, one can observe from Figure 5.17 that arrival time correspond-\ning to signal labeled as Ac17.5 is greater than respective time for BE receiver\n(point BE\n\n?\n\n). Recall setup presented on Chapter 4, Ac17.5 is located at smaller\nvertical distance from source (175 mm) than BE receiver (200 mm). Therefore,\narrival time of shear waves should be lower than respective time for BE receiver\n(point BE\n\n?\n\n). As so, the first deflection point recorded from accelerometers\nsensors was considered to correspond to the real shear wave arrival time.\n\nFor each test several frequencies ranging between 100 Hz and 10 kHz were\ntested at each isotropic stage in order to verify the value for which receivers\nsignals amplification was greater. Then, frequency was chosen taking into ac-\ncount the amplification of the receivers signals, as well as conditions to avoid\nnear\u2013field effects (recall section A.2). The time domain interpretation herein\nused assumes the same travel time for all tested frequencies.\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n?10\n\n?8\n\n?6\n\n?4\n\n?2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nV\no\n\nlta\ng\n\ne\n B\n\nE\n [\nV\n\n]\n\nTime [ms]\n\n \n\n \n\n?50\n\n?40\n\n?30\n\n?20\n\n?10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nV\no\n\nlta\ng\n\ne\n A\n\nc \n[m\n\nV\n]\n\nBE\n\nBE\u2019 Ac\u2019\n\nAc\u2019 BE transmiter\nBE receiver\nAc 2.5\nAc 17.5\n\nFigure 5.17: Time histories of signals from BE and accelerometers\n\nExperimental results\n\nAs described in Chapter 4, specimens were isotropically consolidated and\nthen sheared by the application of large amplitude stress cycles at constant\nconfining stress in a multistage procedure. In Figure 5.18 are illustrated the\ntriaxial results by confining stress.\n\nMeasurements of S\u2013waves velocity using BE and accelerometers were con-\nducted during shearing and shear modulus (G0) was computed. An overview of\nthe global evolution of the shear moduli obtained at isotropic and anisotropic\nstress states is presented in Figure 5.19. The critical review of literature shows\nthat the shear modulus of unbound granular materials at the very small strain\nfollows a power law accordingly to the Equation 5.9.

With regards to unsaturated specimens at isotropic stress state, the\nvariations of modulus versus total vertical stress follow a power law, with ex-\n\n\n\nMechanical characterization 125\n\nponent n increasing from 0.336 to 0.522 and from 0.374 to 0.586 for BE and\naccelerometers results, respectively, with increasing molding water content, i.e.,\nwith decreasing suction. On the contrary, coefficient of stiffness C decreases\nwith increasing molding water content. This trends highlight the increasing\nstiffness with decreasing moisture content from unsaturated specimens exhibit-\ning, therefore, the influence of suction.\n\nThe dry specimen exhibits the stiffer slope (n = 0.654 and n = 0.737), which\nis close to the usual values found for dry granular soils (Fleureau et al., 2003).\nCorresponding shear modulus values are similar to the ones obtained from wOPM\nunsaturated specimen, which is not fully understood since lower values would\nbe expected. As mentioned earlier for triaxial tests, this fact may be attributed\nto the influence of hygroscopic water.\n\nAlthough similar trends for exponent n and coefficient C are verified at\nanisotropic stress states, slopes (n) and coefficient of stiffness C slightly var-\nied. It appears that induced anisotropy influence shear modulus evolution at\nvery small strains. This notwithstanding, G0 depends noticeably on total mean\nstress, being always larger for driest unsaturated specimens. Further it is note-\nworthy that power laws for driest specimens (wOPM?4% and wOPM?2%) are\nmore or less paralell. The same happens with quasi\u2013saturated specimens (wOPM\nand wOPM+2%), yet presenting a stiffer slope and being almost superimposed.\nFleureau et al. (2003) achieved similar trends regarding \u201cPerafita\u201d sand.\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n2\n\n10\n3\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n2\n\n10\n3\n\nTotal mean stress, p [kPa]\n\nG\n0\n [\nM\n\nP\na\n\n]\n\n(a)\n\n10\n2\n\n10\n3\n\n10\n2\n\n10\n3\n\nTotal mean stress, p [kPa]\n\nG\n0\n [\nM\n\nP\na\n\n]\n\n(b)\n\nBE wOPM?4% wOPM?2% wOPM wOPM+2% wdry\n\nAc wOPM?4% wOPM?2% wOPM wOPM+2% wdry\n\nFigure 5.19: Evolution of shear moduli with total vertical stress obtained from\nmeasurements of S\u2013waves on SC unsaturated samples at: (a) isotropic stress\nstate; (b) anisotropic stress state\n\nFurther, shear modulus was corrected to the same void ratio by using Equa-\ntion 5.7 proposed by (Hardin and Richart, 1963).

This difficulty, probably due to\nnearfield effects amplified by a high degree of saturation, led to pick the wrong\narrival time, thus to mislead computation of S\u2013wave velocity.\n\nOn the other hand, for the remain confining stress stages (200 and 300 kPa),\ndetermination of BE arrival time was clear, as illustrated in Figure 5.22b and,\nthereby, differences became smaller. This is thought to be due to the a decrease\non saturation degree, since water expelling through the draining system was ob-\nserved during test. After test had finished moisture content was determined and\nthis hypothesis was confirmed since a moisture content of 8.9% was found, which\nis close to the optimum water content. Indeed, computed shear modulus at these\nstages were quite similar to the corresponding values from wOPM specimen, as\nseen previously in Figure 5.20b. In conclusion, travel time determination using\naccelerometers is unambiguous whatever material state condition.\n\n5.5 Conclusions\n\nIn this chapter, the most relevant laboratory test results obtained from test-\ning of clayey sand (SC) and crushed aggregate (CA31.5) materials were pre-\nsented. Results were divided according to the characterization type, namely,\nphysical, hydro and mechanical characterization. Emphasis was given to me-\nchanical characterization, particularly in what concerns to SC material.\n\nOnly SC was submitted to hydro characterization. The filter paper technique\nwas employed to measure matric suction on specimens compacted with same\ninitial void ratio but varying molding water contents. Matric suction decreased\nwith increasing saturation degree, ie.e, with increasing molding water content.\nTests showed good repeatability and, thereby, filter paper technique proved to\nbe an easy and low cost method to determine water retention curve.\n\nMechanical characterization involved oedometer test, triaxial tests and tri-\naxial tests with measurement of S\u2013waves velocity. SC specimens with varying\nmolding water content both in unsaturated and saturated conditions were sub-\n\n\n\nConclusions 129\n\nmitted to oedometer tests. In the lower stress range, before yielding, the curves\nshapes are reasonably molding water content independent, thus suction inde-\npendent. On the contrary, in the higher stress range after yielding, curves\nshapes from unsaturated specimens seems to be suction dependent. The data\nconfirm the general findings that an increased suction produces a stiffening of\nthe material with smaller plastic compressibility (Alonso et al., 1990; Cui and\nDelage, 1996), despite the tight differences observed between unsaturated tests.\nSaturated test (zero suction) showed the lowest compressibility which was due\nto a lower initial void ratio. Hence, similar results are produced by variation of\nsuction and density, since any increase in either of these parameters reduces the\ncompressibility. Regarding unloading cycle, it appears that swelling is suction\nindependent for unsaturated specimens.\n\nBoth materials were subjected to triaxial tests. As far as what concerns to\nSC, drained saturated and unsaturated multistage triaxial tests were performed\non specimens compacted with the same initial void ratio and with molding\nwater contents ranging from 4% dry of optimum to 2% wet of optimum. A\nstrong influence of molding water content on the mechanical behaviour of SC\nmaterial was found, namely regarding strength and deformability parameters,\nwhich is attributed to suction effect. However, suction effect decreases with\nincreasing stress and strain levels.\n\nA stress\u2013strain non linear behaviour featuring material in a dense state was\nobserved from all specimens. Specimens with lower molding water content de-\nnoted higher britleness behaviour, corresponding higher secant friction angles.\nHowever, differences become lower with increasing total mean stress level with\nspecimens with lower molding water content presenting higher reduction of se-\ncant friction angles. Moreover, at higher total mean stress ?sec values get closer\nand seems to tend to ?sec value at critical state, which is consistent with de Beer\n(1965) investigations on granular materials in a dense state. Critical state had\nbeen reached in unsaturated and saturated tests and a similar ?cs was found\n(34.1?), which means that material behaviour at critical state is independent of\ninitial saturation condition.\n\nSpecimens deformability were investigated regarding strain levels 0.5 and\n1% and, likewise, identical trends were found. Higher Esec feature specimens\ncompacted dry of optimum. As specimen molding water content approaches\nsaturated condition Esec decreases.. However, differences regarding strain level\n1% are smaller reflecting the influence of strain level. In addition, Esec relation\nfor 0.5 and 1% strain level appears to be fairly constant as moisture increases\nbeyond optimum value for both stress levels, corresponding to about 1.7, which\nis quite similar to relation given by Ishibashi and Zhang (1993). In what con-\ncerns to specimens with lower moisture content, i.e, higher suction, relation\ntends to increase and becomes more pronounced for lower stress levels, which\nis the same to say that as stress level increases there is a reduction of suction\neffect on deformability. Further, degradation curves were found to lie between a\nreference threshold shear strain given by Santos (1999). The influence of mois-\nture content, i.e., suction, on normalized degradation curves confining stress is\nclearly marked. As confining stress increases, differences between degradation\ncurves become smaller. Therefore, as seen previously, as stress level increases\nthere is a reduction of suction effect on deformability.\n\nMultistage procedure was found to provide good results regarding peak de-\nviatoric stresses, as long as no significant structure disturbance is experimented\n\n\n\n130 Laboratory investigation\n\nat each stage. However, stress\u2013strain curves present higher britleness behaviour\nrather than triaxial single stage tests. In addition, similar anisotropic and\nisotropic compression lines regarding wOPM and wOPM iso saturated and un-\nsaturated tests, respectively, were obtained. These results reflect low influence\nof anisotropy induced by multistage triaxial tests. Further, it was interesting\nnoting that slopes (?) of unsaturated samples increase with increasing water\ncontent, thus confirms a decreasing compressibility, as verified in oedometer\ntests.\n\nLikewise to SC material, also saturated and unsaturated multistage triaxial\ntests were performed on CA31.5 specimens compacted with the same initial void\nratio and with molding water contents of 2% dry of optimum and optimum,\naiming to investigate the influence of molding water content on strenght and\ndeformability. In addition, a dry test was carried out.\n\nA stress\u2013strain non linear behaviour featuring material in a dense state was\nobserved from all specimens. Unsaturated specimens denoted higher britleness\nbehaviour, corresponding higher secant friction angles. However, in contrast to\nSC material, specimen with optimum molding water content presented the high-\nest friction angle and saturated specimens the lowest. Once again, differences\nbecome lower with increasing total mean stress level and at higher total mean\nstress ?sec values get closer. Critical state had been reached only for saturated\ntests where a ?cs = 40.8\n\n? was obtained. As so, little differences on samples\nstrength were found whether from saturated or unsaturated samples, which in-\ndicates little influence of suction effect on strength in the range of molding water\ncontent studied.\n\nThe influence of compaction conditions on specimens deformability was in-\nvestigated regarding strain levels 0.5 and 1%. No significant differences on\nspecimens deformability were found for strain and stress levels evaluated. To\nthis end, suction seems not to play an important role on CA31.5 material stiff-\nness for the studied compaction conditions. In addition, Esec relation for 0.5\nand 1% strain level appears to be fairly constant corresponding to about 1.75,\nwhich is quite similar to relation obtained from SC material.\n\nThe very small strains properties of SC were determined from measurements\nof S\u2013waves velocity with bender elements and accelerometers. Tests were carried\nout on specimens with the same initial conditions as for triaxial tests. Measure-\nments were performed at isotropic and anisotropic states. Once again, molding\nwater content strongly influences material stiffness at very small strains. Like-\nwise to conventional triaxial tests, stiffness decreased with increasing molding\nwater content exhibiting, thereby, suction effect. Moreover, at lower stress levels\ndifferences tend to be higher.\n\nAs far as what concerns to comparison between results obtained using BE\nand accelerometers, generally, results obtained with both sensors slightly differs,\nwith exception to the specimen with higher moisture content. The investiga-\ntion of travel time determination showed that picking arrival time from both\naccelerometers is straight, whereas picking BE arrival point is ambiguous. This\ndifficulty, probably due to near\u2013field effects amplified by a high degree of sat-\nuration, led to pick the wrong arrival time, thus to mislead computation of\nS\u2013wave velocity. Therefore, the measurement of S\u2013waves using accelerometers\nas receivers appears to improve measurements quality in the time domain, par-\nticularly concerning quasi\u2013saturated specimens.\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nField investigation: E?vora\ntrial railway embankment\n(ETRE)\n\n6.1 Introduction\n\nThe current field quality control/quality assurance (Qc/Qa) of road and rail-\nway embankments construction requires materials and compacted layers evalu-\nation and comparison with design parameters, that were accessed either by in\nsitu prospection and/or by laboratory tests.\n\nRecently, there is a strong trend towards using stiffness and strength to con-\ntrol compaction rather than index parameters given the importance of these\nmechanistic properties in pavement materials evaluation (Briaud, 2001; Loizos\net al., 2003; Alshibli et al., 2005; Edil and Sawangsurya, 2005). In this scope,\nthe static plate loadind test (SPLT) has been used in Portugal as a reference\ntest either for evaluation of layers deformability and as reference test for per-\nformance related tests. However, the lack of a national SPLT standard for the\napplication on road and railways embankments led constructors to use European\nstandards, specifically, DIN 18134 (2001) and AFNOR NF P94\u2013117\u20131 (2000).\nThis notwithstanding, these standards differ in the test procedure and method\nfor determination of E modulus. Therefore, evaluation of these standards is\nrequired in order to, on one hand, allow comparison of results and definition\nof standard to be used and, on the other hand, to provide a contribution for\nthe European standardisation of SPLT. Further, performance related tests that\nhave been recently developed, namely, impact tests (falling weight deflectometer\n\u2013 FWD and light falling weight deflectometer \u2013 LFWD), the soil stiffness gauge\n(SSG) and spectral analysis of surface waves (SASW), and continuous com-\npaction control test methods (Portanceme?tre), involve different test methods\nwhich are not standardised and, therefore, it demands their in situ calibration\nfor different materials and state conditions using SPLT as reference test.\n\nA full scale trial was performed on a railway embankment aiming to study\nthe influence of compaction conditions on the mechanical behaviour of com-\npacted layers constructed using two geomaterials, a clayey sand (SC) and a\n\n131\n\n\n\n132 Field investigation: ETRE\n\ncrushed aggregate (CA31.5), which were employed in railway embankment and\nrailway track layers, respectively. To this end, SC layers were compacted em-\nploying different thicknesses (0.30, 0.40 and 0.50 m), and different water con-\ntents regarding Modified Proctor (optimum -2%, optimum and optimum +2%),\nwhereas CA31.5 layers were compacted employing different thicknesses (0.22\nand 0.30 m), yet with same water content (optimum Modified Proctor). Index\nparameters and mechanical properties were then evaluated for several energy\nlevels corresponding to 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 passes of the vibrating roller.\n\nIn this chapter, firstly, index parameters (density, ?, and moisture content,\nw) obtained from SCM and NM are presented and directly compared. Secondly,\nresults obtained from SPLT following AFNOR NF P94\u2013117\u20131 (2000) standard\nand using two different measuring systems are evaluated. Then, comparison\nwith corresponding results obtained from SPLT following DIN 18134 (2001) is\nconducted. Following, SPLT is used as reference test and comparison with\nperformance related tests is established . Then analysis of full scale trial results\nis conducted and recommendations are provided. At last, comparison between\nfield and laboratory results is performed.\n\n6.2 State conditions\n\nThe sand cone method (SCM) and nuclear method (NM) provide state pa-\nrameters, namely, density (?) and water content (w). The interpretation of both\ntests is straight. However, it should be noted that NM involved measurements\non the same spot at depths of 0, 0.06 and 0.12 m, which were then averaged.\n\nAlthough SCM enable a direct measurement of density and the direct mea-\nsurement of moisture content through oven drying method (NP 84, 1965), values\nobtained from NM results from an indirect measure. Hence, values obtained\nfrom NM requires calibration with corresponding measures from SCM and oven\ndrying method. In order to establish a relationship between test methods, re-\nlationship between density (?) and volumetric water content (?) is shown in\nFigures 6.1 and 6.2.\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n18 19 20 21 22 23 24\n\nDensity, ?w NM [kN/m\n3\n]\n\nD\ne\n\nn\ns\nit\ny\n, \n?\n\nw\n S\n\nC\nM\n [\nk\nN\n\n/m\n3\n]\n\nSC\n\nCA31.5\n\ny = x + 0.8\n\n(a)\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0\n\nVolumetric water content, ?NM [kN/m\n3\n]\n\nV\no\n\nlu\nm\n\ne\ntr\n\nic\n w\n\na\nte\n\nr \nc\no\n\nn\nte\n\nn\nt,\n ?\n\nS\nC\n\nM\n [\nk\nN\n\n/m\n3\n]\n\nSC\n\nCA31.5\n\ny = x - 0.12\n\nR\n2\n=0.76\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 6.1: Comparison of state parameters obtained from NM and SCM test\nmethods performed on the same grid: (a) density; (b) volumetric water content\n\n\n\nState conditions 133\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n18 19 20 21 22 23 24\n\nDensity, ?w NM [kN/m\n3\n]\n\nD\ne\n\nn\ns\nit\ny\n, \n?\n\nw\n S\n\nC\nM\n [\nk\nN\n\n/m\n3\n]\n\nSC\n\nCA31.5\n\ny = x + 0.45\n\nR\n2\n = 0.70\n\n(a)\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0\n\nVolumetric water content, ?NM [kN/m\n3\n]\n\nV\no\n\nlu\nm\n\ne\ntr\n\nic\n w\n\na\nte\n\nr \nc\no\n\nn\nte\n\nn\nt,\n ?\n\nS\nC\n\nM\n [\nk\nN\n\n/m\n3\n]\n\nSC\n\nCA31.5\n\ny = x - 0.10\n\nR\n2\n? ????\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 6.2: Comparison of average state parameters per layer obtained from\nNM and SCM test methods: (a) density; (b) volumetric water content\n\nThough measures carried out on CA31.5 are plotted no correlation between\ntest methods is established due to lack of results. Thereby, results are corrected\naccordingly individual relationships between average values.\n\nFirstly, in Figure 6.1 only values obtained from tests carried out on the same\ngrid are included and grid homogeneity is assumed. Even though a poor re-\nlationship between density was obtained due to high scatter, values gathered\nfrom SCM are slightly higher. On the contrary, a good relationship between\nvolumetric water content was reached, where a R2 of 0.76 was obtained. Due\nto high scatter from density results, secondly, a relationship between average\nvalues per energy level for each layer was attempted. In Figure 6.2 one can see\nreasonable and good relationships for density (R2 = 0.70) and volumetric water\ncontent (R2 = 0.87), respectively. Hence, values obtained from NM were cali-\nbrated accordingly to expressions in Figure 6.2 and will be employed hereafter.\nThe result of calibration is presented in Figure 6.3.\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n18 19 20 21 22 23 24\n\nDensity, ?w NM [kN/m\n3\n]\n\nD\ne\n\nn\ns\nit\ny\n, \n?\n\nw\n S\n\nC\nM\n [\nk\nN\n\n/m\n3\n]\n\nSC\n\nCA31.5\n\n(a)\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0\n\nVolumetric water content, ?NM [kN/m\n3\n]\n\nV\no\n\nlu\nm\n\ne\ntr\n\nic\n w\n\na\nte\n\nr \nc\no\n\nn\nte\n\nn\nt,\n ?\n\nS\nC\n\nM\n [\nk\nN\n\n/m\n3\n]\n\nSC\n\nCA31.5\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 6.3: SCM parameters plotted against NM calibrated parameters: (a)\ndensity; (b) volumetric water content\n\nFollowing, the state parameters obtained from each test method on SC com-\n\n\n\n134 Field investigation: ETRE\n\npacted layers are presented in Figure 6.4 for several energy levels.

Remaining layers present great\nscatter despite the fact that material had been subject to a process to make\nit homogeneous previously to its application, as described in Chapter 4. To\n\n\n\nState conditions 135\n\nsome extent this may be attributed to the weather conditions during these\nlayers construction. Concerning to SCM tests results (fig. 6.4), the lowest\ndry density was obtained on 0.50 m wOPM?2% layer which lied below the 97%\nProctor Modified limit, whereas for the remain layers this limit seems to be\nachieved at the last energy level (12 passes). With regards to NM tests results,\nhigh scatter is verified. This notwithstanding, the great number of tests allows\nto see that there is a gradual shift of optimum moisture content to the left,\nwhich means that wOPM decreases with increasing energy level, as would be\nexpected.\n\nIn Figure 6.5 data from SCM and NM tests carried out on CA31.5 layers are\nillustrated. Due to time constraints SCM was performed only for one energy\nlevel. The analysis of NM calibrated results for all energy levels demonstrate\nan increasing ?d with increasing energy exceeding maximum dry density given\nby Modified Proctor. Concerning to moisture content, w, an increase about 2%\nbetween the first and last energy levels is observed. This propably was due to\nweather conditions, which were adverse during runing tests on these trial layers.\nNevertheless, for the last energy level moisture content is close to optimum value\nfrom Modified Proctor.\n\nSince an extensive mechanical characterization was performed for the last\nenergy level (12 passes), focus is given to layers state conditions at this stage.\nIn Tables 6.1 and 6.2 is given statistical data regarding SC and CA31.5 trial\nlayers, respectively. In what concerns to the former layers constructed with 2%\ndry of optimum, the desirable moisture content was achieved only for layers\nwith 0.30 and 0.50 m thickness, which average value was about 2.5\u20133% dry of\noptimum. With regards to dry density a higher average value was reached for\nlayer with 0.30 m thickness, which is close to 98% of Modified Proctor, whereas\naverage dry density for 0.50 m layer was close to 94%. These results denote\nthe influence of layer thickness on dry density regarding compaction equipment\nused.\n\nTable 6.1: State conditions of SC trial layers obtained from SCM and NM after\ncalibration for the last energy level (12 passes)\n\n0.30 m 0.50 m 0.40 m\nwOPM?2% wOPM?2% wOPM wOPM?2% wOPM+2%\n\nSCM ?d [kN/m\n3] 19.64 18.93 19.62 19.55\n\nSD 0.40 0.17 0.12\nCV 2.1 0.9 0.6\nw [%] 6.3 6.3 8.3 10.4\nSD 0.72 0.23 0.51\nCV 11.5 3.7 4.9\n\nNM ?d [kN/m\n3] 19.71 19.03 19.18 19.26 19.39\n\nSD 0.50 0.97 0.74 0.61 0.41\nCV 2.5 5.1 3.9 3.1 2.1\nw [%] 5.7 5.8 8.0 10.0 10.2\nSD 0.50 0.84 1.03 0.90 1.01\nCV 8.8 14.4 12.8 9.0 9.8\n\nWith regards to layer constructed with moisture content close to optimum\nand 0.40 m thickness, one can see that the NM average value corresponds to 0.5%\n\n\n\n136 Field investigation: ETRE\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nMoisture content, w [%]\n\nD\nry\n\n d\ne\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n, ?\n\nd\n [\n\nkN\n/m\n\n3\n]\n\n(a)\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nMoisture content, w [%]\n\nD\nry\n\n d\ne\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n, ?\n\nd\n [\n\nkN\n/m\n\n3\n]\n\n(b)\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nMoisture content, w [%]\n\nD\nry\n\n d\ne\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n, ?\n\nd\n [\n\nkN\n/m\n\n3\n]\n\n(c)\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nMoisture content, w [%]\n\nD\nry\n\n d\ne\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n, ?\n\nd\n [\n\nkN\n/m\n\n3\n]\n\n(d)\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nMoisture content, w [%]\n\nD\nry\n\n d\ne\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n, ?\n\nd\n [\n\nkN\n/m\n\n3\n]\n\n(e)\n\nNM\n0.22 m wOPM\n0.30 m wOPM\nSCM\n0.22 m wOPM\n0.30 m wOPM\nModified Proctor\n97% Modified Proctor\n\nFigure 6.5: State parameters obtained from SCM and NM on CA31.5 layers\nfor energy level corresponding to: (a) 4 Passes; (b) 6 Passes; (c) 8 Passes; (d)\n10 Passes; (e) 12 Passes\n\ndry of optimum and an average dry density corresponding to 95% of Modified\nProctor was achieved for the last energy level.\n\nConcerning to remaining SC layers with 0.40 m, though different moisture\ncontents were attempted, 2% dry of otpimum and 2% wet of optimum, an\nidentical moisture content was reached on both layers, which was about 1.5%\nwet of optimum value.

These were car-\nried out following both AFNOR NF P94\u2013117\u20131 (2000) and DIN 18134 (2001)\nstandards, corresponding to 78 and 34 tests, respectively, yet the latter were\nperformed only for the last energy level at each layer, as listed in section 4.3.\nRegarding running tests following AFNOR standard, two settlement measure-\nment systems were used at the same time: one measuring settlement at the\ncenter and another measuring settlement in three concentric points on periph-\nery of the loading plate. For this reason, results obtained following AFNOR\nstandard will be differentiated accordingly the settlement measuring system.\nOnly one settlement measurement system measuring at the center of the load-\ning plate was used on tests conducted following DIN standard. Statistical data\n(average, standard deviation, SD, and coefficient of variation, CV) obtained\nfrom SPLT is given in Appendix C. The individual tests results were reported\nin Gomes Correia et al.

Thus, the settlement of the supports\nof the three point measuring system and the settlement of the structure were\nassessed attempting to justify these differences. However, it was found out\ninsignificant support settlement (?s) in such a way to affect the measurement\nof the settlement of the loading plate (?lp).

The load\u2013settlement curve is presented in Figure 6.7.\n\n0.00\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\n0.25\n\n0.0 0.3 0.6 0.9 1.2\n\nSettlement [mm]\n\nS\ntr\n\ne\ns\ns\n [\n\nM\nP\n\na\n]\n\nCenter\n\n3 Point\n\nFigure 6.7: Third loading cycle of a SPLT following standard AFNOR carried\nout on grid A10 of the trial layer 0.40 wOPM, which energy level corresponds to\n12 Passes of the vibrating roller.

Though\nin this case it differs approximately 10% (see Table 6.3), which is thought to be\nan acceptable difference.\n\nTable 6.3: Comparison of the settlements measured with the one point mea-\nsuring system, through the hole in the center (second loading cycle) or on the\nloading plate 2 cm away from the center (third loading cycle), and with the three\npoint measuring system\n\nLoading One point on the center Three Point Difference\ncycle [mm] [mm] [%]\n\nThrough the hole On the plate\n\n2nd 0.564 \u2013 1.078 91.1\n3rd \u2013 1.015 1.115 9.9\n\nFurthermore, it should be pointed out the difference between the settlement\nmeasured with the three point measuring system between second and third\nloading cycles that is 3.4%. In the same way, a difference in the same range\nbetween settlemen measured with the one point measuring system, through the\nhole in the center (second loading cycle) or on the loading plate 2 cm away from\nthe center (third loading cycle), should be similar. However, a difference of\n80% is verified. As a result, measurement through the hole in the center of the\nloading plate appears to exhibit a punching phenomenon, which might explain\nthe differences mentioned above. Hence, the measurement of the settlement with\none point measuring system should be performed on the center of the loading\nplate instead through the hole in the center in contact with the material being\ntested.\n\nThe analysis of the whole SPLT following AFNOR standard, where the two\n\n\n\n140 Field investigation: ETRE\n\nsettlement measuring systems were used at the same time, allows to conclude\nthat EV2 modulus obtained with one point measuring system through the hole\nin the center of the loading plate is approximately 30% higher than the corre-\nsponding value obtained with the three point measuring system, as illustrated\nin Figure 6.8.

Taking into\naccount the importance that this parameter assumes on quality control of em-\nbankments layers, comparison between values obtained following each standard\nwas conducted. With this purpose, experimental plan provided SPLT performed\nfollowing AFNOR NF P94\u2013117\u20131 (2000) and DIN 18134 (2001) standards on all\ntrial layers for the last energy level, corresponding to 12 passes of the vibrating\nroller.\n\nFor the sake of the interpretation and comparison of SPLT, some issues\nmust be pointed out. First, SPLT were performed in different grids (5\u00d72 m2)\non trial layers 0.30 wOPM?2%, 0.40 wOPM?2%, 0.50 wOPM?2% and 0.40 wOPM.\nSecond, SPLT were conducted in same grids (5\u00d72 m2) on remaining trial layers,\nnamely, 0.40 wOPM+2%, 0.22 wOPM and 0.30 wOPM. Finally, with exception to\ntests performed on trial layers 0.50 wOPM?2% and 0.30 wOPM?2%, all the other\nones were performed in the same day. Table 6.4 sum up these issues.\n\nComparison of EV2 modulus obtained from SPLT direct interpretation\nof standards\n\nResults obtained from SPLT carried out in the same grid (5\u00d72 m2) were\ncompared assuming homogeneity of state parameters per grid. For this reason,\n\n\n\nModuli from SPLT 141\n\nTable 6.4: Synthesis of SPLT for the energy level corresponding to 12 Passes of\nthe vibrating roller\n\nLayer Number of SPLT fol-\nlowing each standard\n\nPerformed in\nthe same grid?\n\nPerformed in\nthe same day?\n\n0.30 wOPM?2% 5 No No\n0.40 wOPM?2% 5 No Y es\n0.50 wOPM?2% 5 No No\n0.40 wOPM 5 No Y es\n0.40 wOPM+2% 4 Y es Y es\n0.22 wOPM 5 Y es Y es\n0.30 wOPM 5 Y es Y es\n\nit is believed that correlations presented are independent from state parameters\nof each layer and, therefore, results from all layers were compared together.\n\nComparison of EV2 modulus obtained from direct interpretation of SPLT\nfollowing both standards is presented in Figure 6.9a. One can see that EV2\nmodulus obtained from direct interpretation of SPLT following DIN standard\nis about 15% higher than corresponding values obtained from SPLT following\nAFNOR standard. An acceptable correlation is verified (R2 = 0.69).\n\nOn the assumption of homogeinity of state parameters, comparison between\nthe average values of EV2 per layer was carried out. In Figure 6.9b are plot-\nted the EV2 average values resulting from direct interpretation of five SPLTs\nfollowing each standard. Average values of EV2 obtained from direct interpre-\ntation of SPLT following DIN standard are 11% higher than the corresponding\nvalues obtained following AFNOR standard, which is similar to the one verified\nfor comparison of tests performed in the same grid. Thereby, the assumptions\nabout homogeneity of state parameters per layer are validated by this correla-\ntion.

Herein, focus will be given to the latter. Two\nmain differences on the interpretation method must be highlight: (i) the normal\nstress below the plate for which EV2 is calculated; (ii) the method for determi-\nnation of plate settlement (recall Chapter 2). On one hand, interpretation of\nSPLT following AFNOR standard is performed for a normal stress below the\nplate of 200 kPa and using secant method for settlement determination. On\nthe other hand, interpretation of SPLT following DIN standard is performed\nfor a normal stress below the plate of 250 kPa and using tangent method for\nsettlement determination.\n\nRegarding non\u2013linear stress\u2013strain behaviour of geomaterials, comparison\nof EV2 modulus should be carried for the same normal stress and using same\nmethod for settlement determination (secant or tangent). Hence, a normal\nstress of 200 kPa and secant method was set as reference for the interpretation\nof SPLTs. This option was limited by AFNOR standard procedure which deter-\nmines a maximum normal stress below the plate of 200 kPa during the second\nloading cycle and only allows the secant method to be used. In the same manner\nas previously presented, in Figure 6.10 are plotted the EV2 modulus obtained\nfrom tests carried out in the same grid and average values per layer. One can\nsee that differences decreases when interpretation for the same normal stress\n(200 kPa) and same method (secant) is conducted. EV2 modulus obtained from\ntests following DIN procedure are about 10% or 15% lower than corresponding\nvalues obtained from tests following AFNOR standard, either when comparison\nis made between tests done in the same grid (fig. 6.10a) or between average\nvalues per layer (fig. 6.10b), respectively. Once again, acceptable and good\ncorrelations are testified by values of R2 equal to 0.68 and 0.81.\n\ny = 1.10x\n\nR\n2\n = 0.68\n\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\n120\n\n150\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150\n\nEV2 DIN [MPa]\n\nE\nV\n2\n A\nF\nN\nO\nR\n [\nM\nP\na\n]\n\nSC\n\nCA31.5\n\nPrediction Limit 95%\n\n(a)\n\ny = 1.15x\n\nR\n2\n = 0.81\n\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\n120\n\n150\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150\n\nEV2 DIN [MPa]\n\nE\nV\n2\n A\nF\nN\nO\nR\n [\nM\nP\na\n]\n\nSC\n\nCA31.5\n\nPrediction Limit 95%\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 6.10: Comparison of EV2 modulus obtained from interpretation of SPLT\nfor same normal stress (200 kPa) and same method: (a) tests performed in the\nsame grid; (b) average value per layer.\n\nIn conclusion, from straight interpretation of SPLT following both standards\nor even when interpretation for same normal stress (200 kPa) and same method\n(secant) is performed, slightly differences are observed. Therefore, for the stud-\n\n\n\nModuli from SPLT 143\n\nied geomaterials and state parameters, results suggests that test procedure does\nnot have significant influence on value of EV2 modulus.\n\nComparison of EV2 modulus obtained from SPLT back\u2013analysis\n\nSo far SPLT have been compared based on straight interpretation of stan-\ndards or for same normal stress and method. However, it mus be pointed out\nthat difference of plate dimension was not considered, which may influence the\ninterpretation undertaken.\n\nAs mentioned on Chapter 2, SPLT plate with 600 mm in diameter was used\nfor SPLT following AFNOR standard, whereas a plate with 300 mm in diameter\nwas used for SPLT following DIN standard. It is well recognised that the \u201cpres-\nsure bulb\u201d below a circular footing extends to a depth equal to about twice the\ndiameter of the footing. Thus, different \u201cpressure bulbs\u201d are associated to each\nplate. Consequently, in a multi\u2013layer system EV2 modulus per layer must be\ndetermined to allow to compare values independently of standard used. Oth-\nerwise, only comparison of equivalent EV2 modulus is possible. To this end,\nback\u2013analysis of SPLT was carried out. This analysis was based on the Theory\nof Elasticity and on Boussinesq solution for a rigid circular footing with diame-\nter B loaded by force Q, resting on a linear elastic medium with elastic modulus\nE and Poisson ratio ?, as expressed in Equation 6.1.\n\ns =\nQ\n\nB\n\u00b7\n\n(\n\n1 ? ?2\n)\n\nE\n(6.1)\n\nAdopting a Poisson ratio, ?, equation 6.1 allows to estimate E modulus.\nSolving equation 6.1 in order to E modulus the following expression is obtained:\n\nE =\n?\n\n2\n\u00b7\n(\n\n1 ? ?2\n)\n\n\u00b7\np \u00b7 r\n\ns\n(6.2)\n\nwhere p is the stress below the footing and r is the diameter. From previous\nexpression a coefficient of rigidity footing, Irig may be defined as follows:\n\nIrig =\n?\n\n2\n\u00b7\n(\n\n1 ? ?2\n)\n\n(6.3)\n\nIn order to determine E modulus from back\u2013analysis, a numerical model was\nimplemented using a finite element commercial program (TNO, 2005) and an\naxisymmetric model was used. The methodology for back\u2013analysis calculations\nconsisted in three phases.\n\nIn the first phase rigidity of plates was evaluated. With this purpose,\nAFNOR and DIN plate (recall Chapter 2) were modeled, the latter considering\nthree thicknesses 21 (plate used in situ tests), 50 and 150 mm. In addition,\na uniform load applied directly over foundation was modeled in order to con-\nfirm Irig given by analytical expressions (Poulos and Davis, 1974). SPLTs were\nmodeled with concentric static linear load applied on plates and a wide range\nof foundation modulus (0\u2013400 MPa) was considered. A Poisson ratio ? = 0.20\nwas employed. From the input load and modulus and output settlement the\nIrig was determined. Results obtained are shown in Figure 6.11. From analysis\nof Figure 6.11 it can be concluded that AFNOR plate behaves as rigid plate.\nHowever, the value of Irig is lower than theoretical value, 1.51. An interesting\nbehaviour regarding DIN plate 21 mm is observed. For low values of E modulus\n\n\n\n144 Field investigation: ETRE\n\nplate behaves as rigid plate, while for high values of E modulus plate behaves\ntowards flexible plate since Irig becomes closer to the theoretical value for flex-\nible plate, 1.9 (Poulos and Davis, 1974). In order to check minimum thickness\nfor DIN plate to behave as rigid plate, thicknesses equal to 50 and 150 mm were\nstudied. Behaviour as rigid plate was verified for both thicknesses. To sum up,\nconcerning plates used in field tests, both plates behaves as rigid plate within the\ninterval range of interest, i.e., for values of E modulus given by in situ SPLTs.\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2.0\n\n0 100 200 300 400\n\nE [MPa]\n\nI r\nig\n\nAFNOR plate\n\nDIN plate - \n21mm thickness\n\nDIN plate - \n50mm thickness\n\nDIN plate -\n150mm thickness\n\nUniforme load -\nno plate\n\nFigure 6.11: Coefficient of rigidity Irig determined from numerical analysis\n\nThe second phase consisted on the validation of numerical analysis. With\nthis purpose, numerical modeling of SPLT was conducted to verify relationship\nbetween EV2 given by the interpretation of both standards for the same normal\nstress, 200 kPa, which results are plloted in Figure 6.12. Relationship between\nEV2 is identical to the one obtained by comparison of interpretation of SPLT\nresults for the same stress and method (see fig. 6.10). Although Irig of plates\ngiven by numerical models are not the same given by standards, it can be ob-\nserved negligible influence on relationship established, thus validating numerical\nmodeling.\n\ny = 1.06x\n\nR\n2\n = 0.64\n\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\n120\n\n150\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150\n\nEV2 DIN [MPa]\n\nE\nV\n2\n A\nF\nN\nO\nR\n [\nM\nP\na\n]\n\nSC\n\nCA31.5\n\nPrediction Limit 95%\n\n(a)\n\ny = 1.12x\n\nR\n2\n = 0.79\n\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\n120\n\n150\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150\n\nEV2 DIN [MPa]\n\nE\nV\n2\n A\nF\nN\nO\nR\n [\nM\nP\na\n]\n\nSC\n\nCA31.5\n\nPrediction Limit 95%\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 6.12: Comparison of EV2 modulus obtained from numerical modeling of\nSPLT for same normal stress (200 kPa) and same method: (a) tests performed\nin the same grid; (b) average value per layer\n\nIn the third phase back\u2013analysis was conducted.

A\nrelationship close to unit between computed values can be seen. A reasonable\ncorrelation is exhibited by a R2 equal to 0.44. Since a relationship close to unit\nwas obtained, one may conclude that plate diameter had slightly influence on\nthe result of studied cases. Nevertheless, for multi\u2013layered system, comparison\nof EV2 modulus obtained from SPLTs using different plates can only be made\nby conversion of values for a certain layer with a certain thickness.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 6.13: Properties and geometry adopted in numerical models for back\u2013\nanalysis of SPLT models following: (a) AFNOR NF P94\u2013117\u20131 (2000); (b)\nDIN 18134 (2001) standards\n\ny = 0.92x\n\nR\n2\n = 0.44\n\n0\n\n15\n\n30\n\n45\n\n60\n\n0 15 30 45 60\n\nEV2 DIN [MPa]\n\nE\nV\n\n2\n A\n\nF\nN\n\nO\nR\n [\nM\n\nP\na\n]\n\n0.40 m  wopt-2%\n\n0.40 m  wopt+2%\n\nPrediction Limit 95%\n\nFigure 6.14: Comparison of EV2 modulus obtained from back\u2013analysis\n\nTo sum up, comparison between test results following AFNOR and DIN\nstandards should take into account the stress level and method on test interpre-\ntation. Furthermore, the plate diameter and plate coefficient of rigidity should\nbe taken into account on determination of equivalent modulus. In addition,\nSPLT carried out accordingly AFNOR NF P94\u2013117\u20131 (2000) should be carried\nout using a measuring system that directly measures the plate settlement either\nusing a three point or one point measuring system. These recommendations\nled to a specification project of SPLT (Gomes Correia et al., 2007) which is\npresented in Appendix B.\n\n\n\n146 Field investigation: ETRE\n\n6.4 Moduli obtained from performance related\n\ntests\n\n6.4.1 LFWD, FWD, SSG and Portanceme?tre\n\nThe LFWD, SSG and Portanceme?tre devices promptly provide ELFWD, ESSG\nand EPort moduli, respectively. In Appendix C is given statistical data (average\nand standard deviation, SD, and coefficient of variation, CV) obtained with\nthese test methods for each trial layer and for several energy levels. The number\nof tests enabling statistic treatment by layer and energy level were listed in\nChapter 4 and individual tests results were reported in Caldeira (2006).\n\nThe FWD device provide maximum deflection from which modulus EFWD\ncan be computed promptly too. All tests were conducted starting with one\nseating load followed by one load drop at four different drop heights, generating\nthis way four different loads, in each station. A load plate with 0.30 m in\ndiameter was used and a flexible load plate was considered. In Appendix C is\ngiven statistical data.\n\nIt should be bear in mind that Portanceme?tre is the only continuous test\nmethod enabling, therefore, an enhanced characterization of mechanical prop-\nerties of compacted layers. In fact, while 2 or 4 LFWD and SSG tests were\nperformed at each lane A, B or C (recall section 4.3), the total length was\nevaluated with Portanceme?tre since it gathers one test per meter.

In what follows is presented the setup and the interpretation of SASW\ntests carried out on 0.40 wOPM compacted layer.\n\n\n\nModuli obtained from performance related tests 147\n\nThe setup involved the instrumentation of surface layer with accelerometers\nplaced at equidistant distances. Four vertical receivers (accelerometers) are\nplaced on the ground at an equal distance from a fixed centerline. Because the\nupper compacted layer of about 0.40 m and foundation layer of about 0.60 m are\nunder consideration, receivers spacing of 1 m is used in this study. The setup\nadopted is illustrated in Figure 6.16.\n\nFigure 6.16: Setup adopted to perform SASW on layer 0.40 wOPM inside grid\nB6\n\nTwo tests were performed, one was carried out inside grid 5\u20136, lane B,\nwhereas another was performed inside grid 8\u20139, also inside lane B. An impulsive\nload is applied in line with the receivers at a distance away from the receiver\nequal to receivers spacing. To improve the signal\u2013to\u2013noise ratio, the impacts are\nrepeated several times (about 20 impacts). A reverse test is also performed with\nthe source in the opposite side of the receiver array, in order to confirm the first\ntest. Active Rayleigh wave data were generated using a light hammer source.\nThe typical waveforms of signals generated using a light hammer source and its\nspectrum is presented in Figure 6.17.

In this section, correlation between E modulus obtained from SPLT\ntest and performance related tests (LFWD, SSG and Portanceme?tre) will be\nestablished. To this end, EV2 modulus from SPLT using three point measuring\nsystem will be set as the reference value, accordingly to conclusions reached on\nprevious sections.\n\nBefore the establishment of correlations, it is important to remind that Por-\ntanceme?tre is a continuous test, while the others being spot tests, as aforemen-\ntioned. The output of Portanceme?tre is about one value per meter, which means\napproximately five values per grid with dimensions 5\u00d72 m2. Therefore, output\nwas managed in order to enable comparison between values obtained from spot\ntests. As so, an average value of EPort modulus per grid value was determined.\nIn Figure 6.22 the number of original output given by the equipment, aver-\nage per grid and computed spacial distribution are illustrated concerning layer\n0.30 m wOPM?2% last energy level.\n\nThe methodology employed to the establishment of relationships between\nSPLT and performance related tests was based is the following steps:\n\n(i) comparison between tests results performed in the same spot for all energy\nlevels;\n\n(ii) comparison between tests results performed in the same grid for all energy\nlevels;\n\n(iii) comparison between average values per energy level grouped into homoge-\nneous areas given by Portanceme?tre;\n\n(iv) comparison between average values per energy level;\n\n(v) perform previous iterations, yet only considering the last energy level (12\npasses).\n\nEver tests results are unavailable or established relationships at each step\nshow high scatter will not be presented.\n\n\n\n152 Field investigation: ETRE\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nE [MPa] 85 - 90 90 - 100 100 - 120 120 - 130 130 - 140 140 - 150\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 6.22: Plant representation of the output of Portanceme?tre: (a) values\ngiven by the equipment; (b) average values; (c) computed spacial distribution\nconcerning layer 0.30 m wOPM?2% last energy level (12 passes)\n\nOwing to the third step, homogeneous areas were defined by averaging Por-\ntanceme?tre modulus in each 5\u00d72 m2 grid into groups with intervals within the\nrange of 10 MPa. For instance, every grid with an average EPort modulus\nbetween 80 and 90 MPa belongs to the same homogeneous area. Spot tests be-\nlonging to a given homogeneous area were also grouped together and average\nwas computed. The correlations between Portanceme?tre results and the other\ntests were established by comparing the respective average modulus for each ho-\nmogeneous area. It is worth noting the fact that output values of Portanceme?tre\nresults from calibration made at the time of the construction of the new E?vora\nrailway line. The materials used in the trial embankment were similar to the\nones used in the new railway line. Regarding the last step, it is intended to\nestablish relationships between tests carried out for an energy level with low\nscatter regarding state conditions.\n\n6.5.1 SC trial layers\n\nIn first place, relationship between moduli obtained from Portanceme?tre and\nSPLT is evaluated. Figure 6.23 show reasonable correlation (R2 = 0.65) close\nto unity between EPort and EV2 AFNOR moduli corresponding to average values\nper energy level (number of passes of the vibrating roller).\n\nA similar trend is given by relationships between tests results for the last\nenergy level, as presented in Figure 6.24, yet modulus obtained from Por-\ntanceme?tre being slightly higher. Poor correlation (R2 = 0.42) is observed\nfrom relationship established between tests performed in the the same grid for\nthe last energy level (fig. 6.24a), whereas a reasonable correlation is found from\n\n\n\nCorrelation between E modulus for several tests 153\n\ny = 0.95x\n\nR\n2\n = 0.65\n\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\n125\n\n150\n\n0 25 50 75 100 125 150\n\nEPort [MPa]\n\nE\nV\n\n2\n A\n\nF\nN\n\nO\nR\n [\nM\n\nP\na\n]\n\n0.30 m wopt-2%\n\n0.40 m wopt-2%\n\n0.40 m wopt\n\n0.40 m wopt+2%\n\n0.50 m wopt-2%\n\nFigure 6.23: Comparison between EPort and EV2 AFNOR average values per en-\nergy level\n\ncomparison between average values grouped into homogeneous areas given by\nPortanceme?tre (fig. 6.24b). In contrast, comparison between average values\nnoticeably improves correlation where a R2 = 0.97 is obtained (fig. 6.24c). It\nis noteworthy that correlations present reduced scatter at the last energy level,\nwhich denotes greater homogeneity of mechanical properties. Note that the cal-\nibration of Portanceme?tre is corroborated by this results, despite the fact that\nPortanceme?tre modulus being overestimated for values higher than 110 MPa.\n\nIn second place, LFWD results are compared with reference test SPLT. In\nFigure 6.25a is plotted the EV2 AFNOR against ELFWD modulus for tests pre-\nformed in the same spot and for several energy levels. Despite high scatter\n(R2 = 0.29), a correlation between moduli close to unity is verified. The eval-\nuation of the relationship between average moduli per energy level show an\nidentical trend, but higher scatter is associated (R2 = 0.26), as illustrated in\nFigure 6.25b.\n\nFurther, in Figure 6.26 is shown the correlations established for the last\nenergy level. Identical trends are verified for both values grouped into homo-\ngeneous areas and average values, yet an enhanced correlations are observed,\nwhich means reduced scatter at this energy level. Likewise to previous results,\nit is noteworthy that coefficient of determination is higher regarding average\nvalues per energy level (R2 = 0.64). It should be noted that correlation close to\nunity was obtained.\n\nIn third place, relationship between moduli obtained from SSG and SPLT\nis shown in Figure 6.27. Although higher scatter is observed for average val-\nues per energy level (fig. 6.27a), ESSG modulus is found to be approximately\n34% higher than EV2 AFNOR. An identical trend is obtained from relationship\nbetween average values for the last energy level (fig. 6.27b), yet with slightly\nreduced scatter (R2 = 0.41).\n\nFinally, moduli obtained from FWD and SASW are analyzed. Concerning\nthe former, since tests were carried out only for layer 0.40 m wOPM for the\nlast energy level, average EFWD modulus is compared with corresponding value\nobtained from reference test. As so, average modulus corresponding to the\nfirst drop (EFWD = 191.9) is about 2.5 times EV2 AFNOR. With regards to\nSASW, two tests were performed on trial layer 0.40 wOPM, on grids B6 and B9,\n\n\n\n154 Field investigation: ETRE\n\ny = 0.93x\n\nR\n2\n = 0.42\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\n125\n\n150\n\n50 75 100 125 150\n\nEPort [MPa]\n\nE\nV\n2\n A\nF\nN\nO\nR\n [\nM\nP\na\n]\n\n0.30 m / wopt-2%\n\n0.40 m / wopt\n\n0.50 m / wopt-2%\n\n(a)\n\ny = 0.92x\n\nR\n2\n = 0.56\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\n125\n\n150\n\n50 75 100 125 150\n\nEPort [MPa]\n\nE\nV\n\n2\n A\n\nF\nN\n\nO\nR\n [\nM\n\nP\na\n]\n\n0.30 m wopt-2%\n\n0.40 m wopt\n\n0.50 m wopt-2%\n\n(b)\n\ny = 0.88x\n\nR\n2\n = 0.97\n\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\n125\n\n150\n\n0 25 50 75 100 125 150\n\nEPort [MPa]\n\nE\nV\n\n2\n A\n\nF\nN\n\nO\nR\n [\nM\n\nP\na\n]\n\n0.30 m wopt-2%\n\n0.40 m wopt-2%\n\n0.40 m wopt\n\n0.40 m wopt+2%\n\n0.50 m wopt-2%\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 6.24: Comparison between EPort and EV2 AFNOR for the last energy level\n(12 passes): (a) tests preformed on the same grid; (b) average values grouped\ninto homogeneous areas; (c) average values per layer\n\ny = 1.07x\n\nR\n2\n = 0.29\n\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\n120\n\n150\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150\n\nELFWD [MPa]\n\nE\nV\n2\n A\nF\nN\nO\nR\n [\nM\nP\na\n]\n\n0.30 m wopt-2%\n\n0.40 m wopt-2%\n\n0.40 m wopt\n\n0.40 m wopt+2%\n\n0.50 m wopt-2%\n\n(a)\n\ny = 1.12x\n\nR\n2\n = 0.26\n\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\n120\n\n150\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150\n\nELFWD [MPa]\n\nE\nV\n\n2\n A\n\nF\nN\n\nO\nR\n [\nM\n\nP\na\n]\n\n0.30 m wopt-2%\n\n0.40 m wopt\n\n0.40 m wopt+2%\n\n0.50 m wopt-2%\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 6.25: Comparison between ELFWD and EV2 AFNOR: (a) tests performed\nin the same spot; (b) average values per energy level\n\n\n\nCorrelation between E modulus for several tests 155\n\ny = 1.10x\n\nR\n2\n = 0.56\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\n125\n\n150\n\n50 75 100 125 150\n\nELFWD [MPa]\n\nE\nV\n\n2\n A\n\nF\nN\n\nO\nR\n [\nM\n\nP\na\n]\n\n0.30 m wopt-2%\n\n0.40 m wopt\n\n0.50 m wopt-2%\n\n(a)\n\ny = 0.99x\n\nR\n2\n = 0.64\n\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\n120\n\n150\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150\n\nELFWD [MPa]\n\nE\nV\n2\n A\nF\nN\nO\nR\n [\nM\nP\na\n]\n\n0.30 m wopt-2%\n\n0.40 m wopt\n\n0.40 m wopt+2%\n\n0.50 m wopt-2%\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 6.26: Comparison between ELFWD and EV2 AFNOR for the last energy\nlevel (12 passes): (a) average values grouped into homogeneous areas; (b) aver-\nage values\n\ny = 0.66x\n\nR\n2\n = 0.33\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n0 50 100 150 200 250\n\nESSG [MPa]\n\nE\nV\n2\n A\nF\nN\nO\nR\n [\nM\nP\na\n]\n\n0.30 m wopt-2%\n\n0.40 m wopt-2%\n\n0.40 m wopt\n\n0.40 m wopt+2%\n\n0.50 m wopt-2%\n\n(a)\n\ny = 0.60x\n\nR\n2\n = 0.41\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n0 50 100 150 200 250\n\nESSG [MPa]\n\nE\nV\n2\n A\nF\nN\nO\nR\n [\nM\nP\na\n]\n\n0.30 m wopt-2%\n\n0.40 m wopt-2%\n\n0.40 m wopt\n\n0.40 m wopt+2%\n\n0.50 m wopt-2%\n\nFigure 6.27: Comparison between ESSG and EV2 AFNOR: (a) average values; (b)\naverage values for the last energy level (12 passes)\n\nwhich interpretation was conducted on section 6.4.2 and a ESASW = 185 MPa\nand ESASW = 130 MPa were obtained, respectively.

Focusing on the analysis of moduli\nand relative compaction, an increase of both parameters with increasing num-\nber of passes is verified. On the other hand, in Figure 6.28b one can see that\nmoisture content remains fairly constant. These trends appears to denote the\ninfluence of dry density on mechanical performance concerning to the same mois-\nture content. However, analysis of results obtained on trial layer with 0.50 m\nthickness with similar moisture content is not so straight. In Figure 6.29a one\ncan see that moduli fairly increases with increasing energy level, yet relative\ncompaction slightly varies.

In Fig-\nures 6.30, 6.31 and 6.32 is presented the evolution of moduli, relative compaction\nand moisture content deviation with number of passes. Maximum relative com-\npaction is achieved at 8 passes for trial layers 0.40 m, wOPM?2% and 0.40 m,\nwOPM, whereas only at 10 passes maximum relative compaction is achieved\nfor trial layer 0.40 m, wOPM+2%. Concerning to 0.40 m trial layer with lower\nmoisture content (fig. 6.30), one can see that state parameters do not vary\nsignificantly with increasing energy level, but moduli seems to increase. As so,\nrelationship between moduli and state parameters can not be established. On\nthe contrary, moduli and relative compaction appears to be related on trial lay-\ners with moisture content 1.5% wet of optimum, since both parameters increase\nwith increasing energy level, as moisture content remains almost constant. This\ntrend is similar to the one verified for trial layer 0.30 m wOPM?2%.\n\nFurther, regarding quality control state parameters and moduli scatter earn\nto be commented for last energy level (12 passes). Concerning to SC layers\nconstructed with 2% dry of optimum, NM statistical data for 0.50 m trial layer\nshows the highest state parameters CV, about 14% and 5% regarding mois-\nture content and dry density, respectively. Corresponding values for 0.30 m trial\nlayer are approximately 9% and 3%, being almost half than values regarding\n0.50 m trial layer (see Tables C.1 and C.3 in Appendix A). With regards to\ntrial layer 0.40 m wOPM, a NM moisture content CV about 13% is associated,\nwhile dry density presents CV close to almost 4%. It is interesting noting that\nmoisture content CV is almost the double than dry density CV for trial layers\ncompacted dry of optimum. As so, to some extent it appears that state param-\neters scatter are related. This relation is not observed concerning remaining\nlayers with 0.40 m thickness and compacted wet of optimum. Dry density CV\nof approximately 3% and 2% and moisture content CV of about 9% and 10%,\nrespectively, were obtained from NM tests carried out on trial layers compacted\nwet of optimum. To this end, state parameters CV lie below the maximum\n\n\n\n158 Field investigation: ETRE\n\n4 6 8 10 12\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nM\no\n\nd\nu\n\nlu\ns,\n\n E\n [\nM\n\nP\na\n\n]\n\nNo. of Passes\n\n \n\n \n\n4 6 8 10 12\n87\n\n92\n\n97\n\n102\n\n107\n\n112\n\nR\ne\n\nla\ntiv\n\ne\n c\n\no\nm\n\np\na\n\nct\nio\n\nn\n, \nR\n\nC\n [\n%\n\n]\n\nE\nV2 AFNOR\n\nE\nPort\n\n?\nd SCM\n\n?\nd NM\n\n(a)\n\n4 6 8 10 12\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nM\no\n\nd\nu\n\nlu\ns,\n\n E\n [\n\nM\nP\n\na\n]\n\nNo. of Passes\n\n \n\n \n\n4 6 8 10 12\n?4.0\n\n?2.0\n\n0.0\n\n+2.0\n\n+4.0\n\n+6.0\n\nM\no\n\nis\ntu\n\nre\n c\n\no\nn\n\nte\nn\n\nt \nd\n\ne\nvi\n\na\ntio\n\nn\n, \n\nw\n [\n\n%\n]\n\nE\nV2 AFNOR\n\nE\nPort\n\nw\nSCM\n\nw\nNM\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 6.30: 0.40 m wOPM layer moduli EPort, relative compaction and moisture\ncontent deviation evolution with number of passes: (a) Moduli and relative\ncompaction; (b) Moduli and moisture content deviation\n\n4 6 8 10 12\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nM\no\n\nd\nu\n\nlu\ns,\n\n E\n [\nM\n\nP\na\n\n]\n\nNo. of Passes\n\n \n\n \n\n4 6 8 10 12\n82\n\n87\n\n92\n\n97\n\n102\n\n107\n\nR\ne\n\nla\ntiv\n\ne\n c\n\no\nm\n\np\na\n\nct\nio\n\nn\n, \nR\n\nC\n [\n%\n\n]\n\nE\nV2 AFNOR\n\nE\nPort\n\n?\nd SCM\n\n?\nd NM\n\n(a)\n\n4 6 8 10 12\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nM\no\n\nd\nu\n\nlu\ns,\n\n E\n [\n\nM\nP\n\na\n]\n\nNo. of Passes\n\n \n\n \n\n4 6 8 10 12\n?6.0\n\n?4.0\n\n?2.0\n\n0.0\n\n+2.0\n\n+4.0\n\nM\no\n\nis\ntu\n\nre\n c\n\no\nn\n\nte\nn\n\nt \nd\n\ne\nvi\n\na\ntio\n\nn\n, \n\nw\n [\n\n%\n]\n\nE\nV2 AFNOR\n\nE\nPort\n\nw\nSCM\n\nw\nNM\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 6.31: 0.40 m wOPM?2% layer moduli EPort, relative compaction and mois-\nture content deviation evolution with number of passes: (a) Moduli and relative\ncompaction; (b) Moduli and moisture content deviation\n\nvalues given by Brandl (1977), 5% for dry density determined by means of NM,\nwith exception to trial layer 0.50 m wOPM?2%.\n\nThe analysis of mechanical properties scatter was based on Portanceme?tre re-\nsults (see Table C.13).

As shown in Chapter 5\nfrom laboratory campaign, this influence is attributed to suction effect. On the\ncontrary, dry density influence on modulus appears to be unnoticeable. The\nevolution of modulus and dry density of trial layers with moisture content 3%\ndry of optimum and 1.5% wet of optimum seems to, at first sight, highlight this\nconclusion. However, these results should be interpreted taking into account\nhydro\u2013mechanical behaviour of unsaturated geomaterials. Concerning to trial\nlayers with moisture content 3% dry of optimum, although dry density from\n0.30 m trial layer is higher than corresponding value from 0.50 m trial layer,\nmodulus is sligthly lower. This phenomena may be due to suction effect. It is\nknown that suction increases with decreasing void ratio and decreasing satura-\ntion degree (see fig. 3.18 from Chapter 3). Since moisture content is similar,\nthe increase of suction due to a lower saturation degree (lower dry density) can\noverlap to the increase of suction due to a lower void ratio (higher dry density).\nThis phenomena should be testified with further laboratory investigation. In\nwhat concerns to trial layers with moisture content 1.5% wet of optimum, suc-\ntion effect is lower and does not seems to explain modulus differences. Instead,\nit may be due to a higher moisture content CV.\n\nTaking into account the aforementioned issues, it seems that influence of\nstate conditions on mechanical properties of compacted requires analysis con-\nsidering moisture content and respective suction effect, particularly in what\nconcerns to layers compacted on dry side of compaction curve. With regards\nto 0.30 m wOPM?2% and 0.50 m wOPM?2% layers, similar mechanical properties\nand moisture content were obtained, but fairly differences on dry density were\nfound. This fact indicate that influence of suction on mechanichal properties\nprevails rather than influence of dry density.\n\nThe influence of CV of state parameters on CV modulus is not clear, as\nseen previously. However, as moisture content of compacted layers approaches\noptimum value and wet side of compaction curve, modulus CV appears to\ndecrease too. As so, requirements regarding modulus and state parameters\n\n\n\n160 Field investigation: ETRE\n\n?4 ?2 0 2 4\n40\n\n65\n\n90\n\n115\n\n140\n\n165\n\nM\no\n\nd\nu\n\nlu\ns,\n\n E\n [\n\nM\nP\n\na\n]\n\nMoisture content deviation, w [%]\n\n \n\n \n\n?4 ?2 0 2 4\n73\n\n79\n\n85\n\n91\n\n97\n\n103\n\nR\ne\n\nla\ntiv\n\ne\n c\n\no\nm\n\np\na\n\nct\nio\n\nn\n, \n\nR\nC\n\n [\n%\n\n]\n\nPortancem\u00e8tre\nNM\n\nFigure 6.33: EPort modulus and relative compaction (RC) versus moisture con-\ntent deviation (w) obtained on SC trial layers for energy level corresponding to\n12 passes\n\nCV of compacted layers should take into account moisture content.\nThe analysis of results from full scale trial enabled to come to several con-\n\nclusions. Concerning to state conditions, namely moisture content, desirable\nmoisture content was not achieved for all trial layers and high scatter was veri-\nfied. As so, the previous stack of material, water adding and mix up by means\nof a front shovel did not reproduced the desirable homogeneity on moisture con-\ntent. The adverse weather conditions during running tests may have partially\ncontributed to increase scatter.\n\nThe evaluation of mechanical properties by means of SPLT following AFNOR\nNF P94\u2013117\u20131 (2000) standard and using different measuring systems showed\nsignificant differences. A three point measuring system or a one point measur-\ning system on the plate should be used rather than one point measuring point\nplaced on a device that measures layer settlement through a hole on the cen-\nter of the plate. Further, analysis of SPLT following AFNOR NF P94\u2013117\u20131\n(2000) and DIN 18134 (2001) standards showed differences on test procedure\nand interpretation, which should be taken into account when comparison be-\ntween test results is proceeded. A direct comparison should be performed for\nthe same stress and method for determination of plate settlement. As men-\ntioned previously, these recommendations led to a specification project of SPLT\n(Gomes Correia et al., 2007) which is presented in Appendix B.\n\nFurthermore, comparison between SPLT results and performance related\ntests allowed to establish correlations and testify equipment calibrations us-\ning SPLT as reference test. Concerning to SC material, a good correlation\nbetween SPLT following AFNOR standard (EV2 AFNOR) and Portanceme?tre\n(EPort) moduli was obtained. This results indicate the huge potential of this\nequipment on continuous stiffness evaluation on earthwork platforms. In con-\ntrast, a poor correlation was achieved regarding comparison between SPLT fol-\nlowing DIN standard (EV2 DIN) and Portanceme?tre (EPort) moduli. This result\nhighlight one advantage of using a plate with larger diameter. A correlation\nclose to unity between SPLT based on the AFNOR standard (EV2) and the\nLFWD (ELFWD) moduli was observed, despite data high scatter. The results\nfrom this equipment should be treated with caution.\n\nIn conclusion, the experiences performed with different equipments to evalu-\nate moduli showed great benefit using Portanceme?tre, although calibration for\n\n\n\nAnalysis of full scale trial results and recommendations 161\n\nmaterial being tested is required. The quick execution and the immediate lay-\nout of the results, which allows quick intervention whenever the deformability\nconditions are not achieved, are great advantages of this equipment. However,\nthe greatest advantage is to allow continuous evaluation of layers stiffness. Nev-\nertheless, an adequate calibration using SPLT is required. With this purpose, it\nis recommended to conduct calibration during execution of trial embankments.\n\n6.6.2 CA31.5 trial layers\n\nLikewise, in Figures 6.34 and 6.35 are plotted moduli, obtained from SPLT\nand Portanceme?tre (after calibration), and relative compaction and moisture\ncontent deviation, obtained from SCM and NM (after calibration), against the\nnumber of passes for CA31.5 trial layers. One can see a almost linear increase of\nrelative compaction with energy level, yet moduli do not follow the same trend.\nOn the other hand, moisture content present great variation between energy\nlevels, ranging from 2% dry of optimum to 1% wet of optimum, which may\nbe partially attributted to adverse weather conditions. This notwithstanding,\nmoduli appears to follow moisture content variation for both layers regarding\nenergy levels corresponding to 4 to 10 passes. This trend indicates the great\ninfluence of moisture content on mechanical performance rather than dry den-\nsity. Concerning the last energy level, a significant moduli decrease is verified,\nthough a decrease of moisture content is not observed in the same proportion.\nIt is noteworthy that modulus reaches the highest value close to optimum water\ncontent. This behaviour agrees with the one found from laboratory tests (recall\nChapter 5), where higher modulus was obtained from specimen with optimum\nmoisture content than modulus obtained from specimen compacted 2% dry of\noptimum.\n\n4 6 8 10 12\n50\n\n70\n\n90\n\n110\n\n130\n\n150\n\nM\no\n\nd\nu\n\nlu\ns,\n\n E\n [\nM\n\nP\na\n\n]\n\nNo. of Passes\n\n \n\n \n\n4 6 8 10 12\n92\n\n97\n\n102\n\n107\n\n112\n\n117\n\nR\ne\n\nla\ntiv\n\ne\n c\n\no\nm\n\np\na\n\nct\nio\n\nn\n, \nR\n\nC\n [\n%\n\n]\n\nE\nV2 AFNOR\n\nE\nPort\n\n?\nd SCM\n\n?\nd NM\n\n(a)\n\n4 6 8 10 12\n50\n\n70\n\n90\n\n110\n\n130\n\n150\n\nM\no\n\nd\nu\n\nlu\ns,\n\n E\n [\n\nM\nP\n\na\n]\n\nNo. of Passes\n\n \n\n \n\n4 6 8 10 12\n?3.0\n\n?2.0\n\n?1.0\n\n0.0\n\n+1.0\n\n+2.0\n\nM\no\n\nis\ntu\n\nre\n c\n\no\nn\n\nte\nn\n\nt \nd\n\ne\nvi\n\na\ntio\n\nn\n, \n\nw\n [\n\n%\n]\n\nE\nV2 AFNOR\n\nE\nPort\n\nw\nSCM\n\nw\nNM\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 6.34: 0.22 m wOPM layer moduli EPort, relative compaction and moisture\ncontent deviation evolution with number of passes: (a) Moduli and relative\ncompaction; (b) Moduli and moisture content deviation\n\nThe influence of moisture constant is illustrated in Figure 6.36 regarding the\nlast energy level (12 passes).

Therefore, equip-\nments calibration for each kind of material is required. In what concerns to the\ninfluence of state parameters on mechanical performance, it seems that mois-\nture content has great influence, yet further conclusions requires investigation\nof trial layers with constant moisture constant, covering a range from 2% dry\nof optimum to optimum.\n\n?1.5 ?1 ?0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\nM\no\n\nd\nu\n\nlu\ns,\n\n E\n [\n\nM\nP\n\na\n]\n\nMoisture content deviation, w [%]\n\n \n\n \n\n?1.5 ?1 ?0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5\n94\n\n97\n\n100\n\n103\n\n106\n\n109\n\nR\ne\n\nla\ntiv\n\ne\n c\n\no\nm\n\np\na\n\nct\nio\n\nn\n, \n\nR\nC\n\n [\n%\n\n]\n\nPortancem\u00e8tre\nNM\n\nFigure 6.36: EPort modulus and relative compaction (RC) versus moisture con-\ntent (w) obtained on CA31.5 trial layers for energy level corresponding to 12\npasses\n\n\n\nComparison between full scale trial and laboratory results 163\n\n6.7 Comparison between full scale trial and lab-\n\noratory results\n\nComparison between moduli obtained from full scale trial and laboratory\ntests are performed herein. To this end, stress and strain levels on both field\nand laboratory tests are taken into account, as well as, state conditions.\n\nFirstly, comparison between modulus obtained from SASW carried out on\n0.40 m wOPM and modulus computed from S\u2013wave measurements on specimen\nwith similar moisture conditions is performed. Methodology for the determina-\ntion of moduli is based on S\u2013wave propagation through geomaterial, thus in-\nvolving similar stress and strain levels. Laboratory results obtained on specimen\nwith optimum moisture content (8.8%) were considered since state conditions\nare the closest to the ones verified on trial layer 0.40 m wOPM. The SASW was\ncarried out on grids B6 and B9 where Vs = 195 m.s\n\n?1 and Vs = 169 m.s\n?1 were\n\nobtained, respectively. However, moisture conditions obtained from NM carried\nout on closest grids, B7 and B10, were 7.6% and 8.8%, respectively. Thereby,\nonly the latter is used herein for the sake of comparison. The state conditions\nand shear modulus determined from field and laboratory tests are summarized\nin Table 6.9. It is noteworthy that laboratory shear modulus was computed\nusing Equation 5.9 and parameters given in Table 5.9. A total mean stress of\n2 kPa corresponding to mean stress at the middle of the layer was considered.\nIn addtion, to take into account the great influence of unsaturated condition at\nthis stress level, matric suction computed from expression given in Figure 5.2\nwas added and a mean stress of 21.8 kPa was obtained. It should be noted that\nmatric suction value is just an approximation since laboratory matric suction\nversus saturation degree curve was determined considering a void ratio of 0.331,\nwhereas field void ratio is 0.370. This notwithstanding, it is thought to be a\ngood approximation taking into account a high saturation degree (about 70%).\nFurther, shear modulus was corrected for the same void ratio.\n\nTable 6.9: Field and laboratory state conditions and modulus regarding SC\ngeomaterial\n\nField Laboratory\nB10 BE Acc\n\n?

As aforementioned, stress and state conditions should be\ntaken into account, thereby field parameters were gathered from NM and SPLT\nresults and are summarized in Table 6.10. As described on Chapter 2, EV2 mod-\nulus following AFNOR standard is computed for a stress level about 200 kPa.\nConsequently, laboratory secant modulus is estimated for the same stress level\nand considering the strain level involved in SPLT performed at each layer. Tri-\naxial tests did no enabled secant modulus for strain levels lower than 0.5%,\nhowever modulus degradation curves lie between a reference threshold given by\nSantos (1999), as illustrated in Figure 5.10 in previous chapter. Hence, secant\nmodulus was computed from Equation 5.8, which parameters are given in Ta-\nble 5.5, for ?1 = 200 kPa and then estimated from the relationship obtained\nfrom G/G0 degradation curves (Ishibashi and Zhang, 1993; Santos, 1999) for\nthe strain levels involved in SPLT (?SPLT in Table 6.10) and 1% (see fig. 5.9).\nFinally, secant modulus was normalised for field void ratio.\n\nTable 6.10: State conditions, average EV2 modulus and corresponding strain\nlevel for SC layers for the last energy level (12 passes)\n\nTrial layers\n0.30 m 0.50 m 0.40 m 0.40 m 0.40 m\n\nwOPM?2% wOPM?2% wOPM wOPM?2% wOPM+2%\n?d 19.54 18.75 19.07 19.48 19.30\nw [%] 6.1 6.3 8.0 9.5 9.7\nvoid ratio, e 0.330 0.386 0.363 0.335 0.347\nEV2 96.2 102.2 74.9 50.8 52.0\n?(field) 1.0% 0.9% 1.2% 1.8% 1.8%\n\nSpecimens\nwOPM?2% wOPM\n\nw [%] 6.9 9.1\nEnorlab\n(?1 = 200 kPa)\n[MPa]\n\n100.3 104.8 85.0 62.8 62.8\n\nf(e lab) 2.541 2.541 2.541 2.541 2.541\nf(e field) 2.544 2.294 2.395 2.524 2.467\nEnorfield (?1 =\n200 kPa) [MPa]\n\n100.4 94.6 80.1 62.4 61.0\n\nEV2/E\nnor\nfield 0.958 1.080 0.935 0.814 0.853\n\nConcerning to layers compacted with moisture content 2% dry of optimum\n(0.30 m wOPM?2% and 0.50 m wOPM?2%), average EV2 modulus differs less than\n8% from modulus determined from triaxial tests on specimen with identical\nmoisture content. However, comparison between average EV2 modulus from\nlayers 0.40 m wOPM?2% and 0.40 m wOPM+2% and secant modulus determined\nfrom specimen with similar moisture content (wOPM) show a difference lower\nthan 18%. Regarding 0.40 m wOPM layer, moisture content is about 1% dry of\noptimum and specimen with similar moisture content is not available. As so\ncomparison with specimen with optimum moisture content is carried out and a\ndifference of about 7% is found.\n\n\n\nConclusions 165\n\nThese results denotes a reasonable relationship between field and laboratory\nmodulus and assumes great importance taking into account two issues: i) design\nis based on mechanical properties usually determined from laboratory tests; ii)\neven though conventional triaxial tests only allow determination of mechanical\nproperties beyond strain level of 1%, for SC geomatrial is possible to estimate\nsecant modulus from degradation curves for lower strain levels since degradation\ncurves lie between reference threshold for sands given by Santos (1999).\n\nFinally, the same procedure was adopted in order to establish comparison\nbetween ESASW and modulus obtained from conventional triaxial tests. With\nthis purpose, laboratory modulus was computed using Equation 5.8. A total\nvertical stress of 4 kPa at the middle of the layer was considered and matric suc-\ntion was added, likewise described previously. Laboratory modulus of 3.6 MPa\nwas obtained, corresponding to a strain level of 1%. From modulus degradation\ncurves obtained in previous chapter (fig. 5.10), modulus reduction at this strain\nlevel is about 85%. Thereby, modulus was corrected to take into account the\nstrain level and the same void ratio. As so, laboratory modulus of 22 MPa was\nachieved, which compares with ESASW equal to 132 MPa. The hudge difference\nfound may be due to the estimation of laboratory modulus for a low stress level,\nwhich was computed out of the stress interval regarding Equation 5.8.\n\nThe relations between laboratory and field modulus found are illustrated in\nFigure 6.37.\n\n20 40 60 80 100 120\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nModulus, E\nlab\n\n and G\nlab\n\n [MPa]\n\nM\no\n\nd\nu\n\nlu\ns,\n\n E\nfie\n\nld\n a\n\nn\nd\n\n G\nfie\n\nld\n [\nM\n\nP\na\n\n]\n\n \n\n \n\nE\nSPLT\n\nG\nSASW\n\nFigure 6.37: Relationship between modulus estimated from laboratory triaxial\ntests and modulus obtained from SPLT carried out on trial layers for the last\nenergy level\n\n6.8 Conclusions\n\nIn this chapter the main results obtained on full scale trial were presented.\nTwo type of geomaterials, clayey sand (SC) and a crushed aggregate (CA31.5),\nwere investigated. To this end, construction of trial layers with different thick-\nnesses (0.22, 0.30, 0.40 and 0.50 m) and different moisture contents (2% dry of\noptimum, optimum and 2% wet of optimum Modified Proctor) were carried out,\nas well as evaluation of state conditions and mechanical properties for several\nenergy levels.\n\nState conditions were evaluated by means of sand cone method (SCM) and\nnuclear method (NM), the latter requiring calibration. Regarding SC trial lay-\n\n\n\n166 Field investigation: ETRE\n\ners, moisture content about 3% dry of optimum was achieved on trial layers\n0.30 m wOPM?2% and 0.50 m wOPM?2%, average moisture content 1.5%wet of\noptimum was achieved on trial layers 0.40 m wOPM?2% and 0.40 m wOPM+2%,\nand average moisture content 0.5% dry of optimum was achieved on trial layers\n0.40 m wOPM. The adverse weather conditions during construction of trial lay-\ners with 0.40 m thickness might had contributed to moisture content mismatch,\nsince favorable weather conditions were verified during construction of trial lay-\ners with 0.30 and 0.50 m thickness. Further, statistical data showed higher\nmoisture content coefficient of variation (CV) from SC trial layers compacted\ndry of optimum, rather than SC trial layers compacted with moisture content\nwet of optimum. As so, the previous stack of material, water adding and mix\nup by means of a front shovel did not reproduced the desirable homogeneity\non moisture content of trial layers compacted dry of optimum. This notwith-\nstanding, dry density CV lie below maximum values given by Brandl (1977),\nwith exception to layer with 0.50 m thickness. Average relative compaction of\nabout 95\u201396% was obtained from trial layers with 0.40 m thikness, whereas 98\nand 94% was obtained from trial layers with 0.30 and 0.50 m thickness, respec-\ntively. As so, layer thickness strongly influences relative compaction. To this\nend, layer with 0.50 m thickness does not fulfill quality control requirements of\nhigh quality projects, namely those regarding high speed embankments.\n\nConcerning to CA31.5 trial layers, moisture content 1% wet of optimum\nwas achieved on layer with 0.22 m thickness, whereas moisture content close to\noptimum value was achieved on trial layer with 0.30 m thickness. As so, desirable\nmoisture content was achieved only for the latter. Further, it is noteworthy that\nmoisture content strongly varied within increasing energy level. In fact, moisture\ncontent obtained from both layers for the first enelgy level was about 1.5% dry\nof optimum. Once again, the previous stack of material, water adding and mix\nup by means of a front shovel did not reproduced the desirable homogeneity\non moisture content. However, adverse weather conditions during construction\nof CA31.5 trial layers might had contributed to a strong variation of moisture\nconditions. Nevertheless, for the last energy level both trial layers presented\nidentical moisture content CV (5 and 7%), whereas dry density CV were less\nthan 2%. Moreover, the same relative compaction was found, about 106%.\n\nMechanical evaluation was performed by means of static plate loading test\n(SPLT) and performance related tests, namely, impact tests (falling weight de-\nflectometer \u2013 FWD and light falling weight deflectometer \u2013 LFWD), the soil\nstiffness gauge (SSG) and spectral analysis of surface waves (SASW), and con-\ntinuous compaction control test method by means of Portanceme?tre.\n\nWith regards to SPLT, tests were conducted accordingly standards AFNOR\nNF P94\u2013117\u20131 (2000) and DIN 18134 (2001). Further, SPLT following AFNOR\nwas carried out using two settlement measuring systems: one measuring settle-\nment on a point at the center of the plate through a hole; another measuring\nsettlement three concentric points on the periphery of the plate. Results from\nthe former measuring systems were found to be more than 30% higher than cor-\nresponding values obtained with the latter. Furthermore, analysis of AFNOR\nand DIN standards showed differences concerning to test proceed and test inter-\npretation. As so, it was demostrated that values obtained from tests following\neach standard can only be compared if interpreted for the same stress (200 kPa)\nand using the same method (secant method). In addition, equivalent modu-\nlus should take into account different plates diameter if a multi\u2013layered system\n\n\n\nConclusions 167\n\nis being tested. Conclusions regarding SPLT led to the specification project\n(Gomes Correia et al., 2007) that is presented in Appendix B.\n\nFurther, correlations between performance related tests and SPLT moduli\nwere established, where SPLT following AFNOR was used as reference test.\nGood correlation between SPLT and Portanceme?tre moduli was established for\nSC trial layers, the latter being about 10% higher than the former. These results\nindicate the huge potential of this equipment for the continuous stiffness evalu-\nation on earthwork platforms, being a non destructive method easy to operate\nenabling quick evaluation of moduli and large number of tests, which allows\nstatistical analysis. Moreover, the instantly layout of moduli enables immediate\nintervention ever quality control requirements are not achieved. In addition,\nafterwards treatment of results allows spacial characterization of full area of\ncompacted layer. Thereby, mechanical evaluation by means of Portanceme?tre\nrepresents a great improvement on quality control/quality assurance (Qa/Qc)\nof compacted layers. Although a correlation close to unity was obtained be-\ntween SPLT and LFWD on SC trial layers, high scatter led to poor correlation.\nThereby, results from this equipment should be treated with caution. No corre-\nlation was found between SPLT and the others performance related tests. Re-\nsults from CA31.5 trial layers did not allowed to establish correlations between\nSPLT as reference test and performance related tests. Therefore, equipments\ncalibration for each kind of material is required.\n\nThen, evaluation of state conditions and mechanical properties with increas-\ning energy level was conducted. In what concerns to SC trial layers no clear\nrelationship between dry density and moduli was found. In contrast, moduli was\nfound to decrease with increasing moisture content, as observed from laboratory\nresults from previous chapter, thus reflecting suction effect on mechanical prop-\nerties. Further, Portanceme?tre moduli CV decreased with increasing moisture\ncontent. These results denote the great influence of moisture content either on\naverage moduli and on homogeneity of mechanical performance of layers em-\nbankment. With regards to CA31.5 trial layers, moduli was found to follow\nmoisture content variation concerning energy levels corresponding to 4 to 10\npasses. Moduli increased with increasing moisture content, as long as moisture\ncontent varies between 2% dry of optimum and optimum value. This trend\nindicates the great influence of moisture content on mechanical performance\nrather than dry density. As so, higher requirements regarding compaction con-\ntrol should be considered when compaction is performed with moisture content\non the dry side, rather than compaction on the wet side, as long as compacted\nlayers will remain in unsaturated condition. To this end, continuous evalua-\ntion of mechanical performance represents a great improvement on compaction\ncontrol.\n\nFinally, comparison between full scale trial and laboratory results was per-\nformed. Shear modulus obtained from SASW carried out on trial layer 0.40 m\nwith optimum moisture content was found to be similar to shear modulus given\nby laboratory tests. Moreover, a maximum difference of 19% between modulus\nobtained from SPLT following AFNOR standard and modulus estimated from\ntriaxial compression tests was found, which assumes great importance taking\ninto account two issues: (i) design is based on mechanical properties usually\ndetermined from laboratory tests; (ii) even though conventional triaxial tests\nonly allow determination of mechanical properties beyond strain level of 1%, for\nSC geomatrial is possible to estimate secant modulus from degradation curves\n\n\n\n168 Field investigation: ETRE\n\nfor lower strain levels since degradation curves lie between reference threshold\nfor sands given by Santos (1999).\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nField investigation: Fafe\ntrial road embankment\n(FTRE)\n\n7.1 Introduction\n\nIn the aim of a national research project POCI/ECM/56952/2004 with the\ngoal to validate/calibrate in situ the results obtained in laboratory for the pro-\ncessed steel slag (inert steel aggregate for construction, ISAC), a trial road\nembankment was constructed where, besides this non\u2013traditional geomaterial,\ntraditional geomaterials, a poor\u2013graded sand with silt and a well\u2013graded gravel\nnamed herein as SP and CA40, respectively, were employed (Gomes Correia\net al., 2009b; Reis Ferreira, 2010). The execution of a trial embankment em-\nploying different materials gave the opportunity to carry out different studies,\nwhich are twofold: (i) mechanical performance of geomaterials were evaluated by\nmeans of static plate loading test (SPLT) and performance related tests, falling\nweight deflectometer (FWD) and light falling weight deflectometer (LFWD),\nthe soil stiffness gauge (SSG), spectral analysis of surface waves (SASW) and\nPortanceme?tre; (ii) instrumentation of the embankment and road layers en-\nabling the measurement of vibrations and strains induced by the compaction\nequipment and by performance related tests.\n\nLikewise to E?vora trial railway embankment (ETRE), the first issue aims to\nestablish correlations between different test methods using SPLT as reference\ntest. Taking into account conclusions from previous chapter regarding SPLT\nand the outcome of the specification project presented in Appendix B, SPLT\nwere performed following this specification project. To this end, SP, CA40 and\nISAC trial, embankment and base layers were compacted employing different\nthicknesses (0.20, 0.30, 0.40 and 0.50 m) and optimum moisture content regard-\ning Modified Proctor. Index parameters and mechanical properties were then\nevaluated for several energy levels corresponding to 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 passes of\nthe vibrating roller. A detailed description is given in Chapter 4. As so, firstly\nindex parameters are evaluated by means of sand cone method (SCM), rubber\nballoon method (RBM) and nuclear method (NM). Secondly, SPLT is used\n\n169\n\n\n\n170 Field investigation: FTRE\n\nas reference test and correlation with performance related tests is established.\nThen analysis of full scale trial results is conducted and recommendations are\nprovided. At last, comparison between field and laboratory results is performed.\n\nThe second issue deals with vibration measurements of roller drum and layers\nvibrations during compaction and application of dynamic loads. It is intended\nto get data in order to investigate the interaction between roller drum and layer\nto be compacted, as well as to realize the magnitude of strains and acceler-\nations induced during compaction, application of dynamic loads with several\nequipments, such as, FWD, LFWD, the Portanceme?tre and during applica-\ntion of static loads while performing SPLT. In this scope, firstly, in\u2013ground\nstrains and acceleration measurements during application of dynamic loads are\npresented and, secondly, roller drum behaviour and layers in\u2013gound behaviour\nduring compaction process is presented.\n\n7.2 State conditions\n\nIn this section SCM and NM results, namely dry density and moisture con-\ntent will be presented. The interpretation of both tests is straight. Likewise in\nprevious chapter, since NM involves measurements at the same spot at depths\nof 0, 0.06 and 0.12 m, an average value at each spot was computed. Then, a re-\nlationship between density (?w) and volumetric water content (?) between both\ntests results was attempted for SP and ISAC materials and is shown in Figures\n7.1 and 7.2.\n\ny = 1.00x + 1.50\n\n19\n\n21\n\n23\n\n25\n\n27\n\n29\n\n19 21 23 25 27 29\n\nDensity, ?w NM [kN/m\n3\n]\n\nD\ne\n\nn\ns\nit\ny\n, \n?\n\nw\n S\n\nC\nM\n\n,R\nB\n\nM\n [\nk\nN\n\n/m\n3\n]\n\nSP\n\nISAC\n\n(a)\n\ny = 1.00x + 0.10\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0\n\nVolumetric water content, ?NM [kN/m\n3\n]\n\nV\no\n\nlu\nm\n\ne\ntr\n\nic\n w\n\na\nte\n\nr \nc\no\n\nn\nte\n\nn\nt,\n ?\n\nS\nC\n\nM\n,R\n\nB\nM\n [\nk\nN\n\n/m\n3\n]\n\nSP\n\nISAC\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7.1: Comparison of state parameters obtained from NM and SCM test\nmethods performed on the same grid: (a) density; (b) volumetric water content\n\nFirstly, in Figure 7.1 only values obtained from tests carried out on the same\ngrid are included and grid homogeneity is assumed. A reasonable relationship\nbetween density and volumetric water content was obtained for SP material\n(R2=0.53 and R2=0.55), while a poor relationship was achieved for ISAC ma-\nterial. Secondly, a relationship between average values per energy level for each\nlayer was attempted in order to reduce scatter (fig. 7.2). Poor relationships\nwere obtained regarding ISAC geomaterial. Therefore, NM appears not to be\nappropriate to evaluate moisture content of ISAC geomaterial and, thereby, cal-\n\n\n\nState conditions 171\n\n19\n\n21\n\n23\n\n25\n\n27\n\n19 21 23 25 27\n\nDensity, ?w NM [kN/m\n3\n]\n\nD\ne\n\nn\ns\nit\ny\n, \n?\n\nw\n S\n\nC\nM\n\n,R\nB\n\nM\n [\nk\nN\n\n/m\n3\n]\n\nSP\n\nISAC\n\n(a)\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0\n\nVolumetric water content, ?NM [kN/m\n3\n]\n\nV\no\n\nlu\nm\n\ne\ntr\n\nic\n w\n\na\nte\n\nr \nc\no\n\nn\nte\n\nn\nt,\n ?\n\nS\nC\n\nM\n [\nk\nN\n\n/m\n3\n]\n\nSP\n\nISAC\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7.2: Comparison of average state parameters per layer obtained from\nNM and SCM test methods: (a) density; (b) volumetric water content\n\nibration was not conducted.

Due to time\nconstraints and labor intensive SCM number of tests are significantly less than\nNM tests. Dry density exceeded the maximum value given by Modified Proctor\nfor all layers and energy levels, which may be attributed to a high energy level\nemployed by compaction equipment. In fact, the distribution of points indicate\nthat maximum dry density is achieved at a lower moisture content on the dry\nside of modified compaction curve which features a higher energy level applied.\nTrial layers (0.30, 0.40 and 0.50 m wOPM) were compacted with moisture content\nabout 3% to 2% dry of optimum, whereas moisture content ranging between 2%\n\n\n\n172 Field investigation: FTRE\n\ndry of optimum and optimum value was achieved on embankment layers (4th,\n5th, 6th, 7th and 8th layers).\n\n4 6 8 10 12 14\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\nMoisture content, w [%]\n\nD\nry\n\n d\ne\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n, ?\n\nd\n [\nkN\n\n/m\n3\n]\n\n(a)\n\n4 6 8 10 12 14\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\nMoisture content, w [%]\n\nD\nry\n\n d\ne\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n, ?\n\nd\n [\nkN\n\n/m\n3\n]\n\n(b)\n\n4 6 8 10 12 14\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\nMoisture content, w [%]\n\nD\nry\n\n d\ne\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n, ?\n\nd\n [\nkN\n\n/m\n3\n]\n\n(c)\n\n4 6 8 10 12 14\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\nMoisture content, w [%]\n\nD\nry\n\n d\ne\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n, ?\n\nd\n [\nkN\n\n/m\n3\n]\n\n(d)\n\n4 6 8 10 12 14\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\nMoisture content, w [%]\n\nD\nry\n\n d\ne\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n, ?\n\nd\n [\nkN\n\n/m\n3\n]\n\n(e)\n\n4 6 8 10 12 14\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\nMoisture content, w [%]\n\nD\nry\n\n d\ne\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n, ?\n\nd\n [\nkN\n\n/m\n3\n]\n\n \n\n \n\nSCM\n0.30 m wOPM\n0.40 m wOPM\nNM\n0.30 m wOPM\n0.40 m wOPM\n0.50 m wOPM\n\n4th\n\n5th\n\n6th\n\n7th\n\n8th\n\n(f)\n\nFigure 7.4: State parameters obtained from SCM and NM on SP layers for\nenergy level corresponding to: (a) 4 Passes; (b) 6 Passes; (c) 8 Passes; (d) 10\nPasses; (e) 12 Passes; (f) 14 Passes\n\nSince an extensive mechanical characterization was performed for the last\nenergy level, focus is given to layers state conditions at this stage. In Table 7.1\nis given respective statistical data regarding SP trial layers and embankment\nlayers. In what concerns to the former layers, moisture content achieved ranged\n\n\n\nModulus from SPLT 173\n\nfrom 6 to 4% dry of optimum. The highest dry density was obtained from trial\nlayer with 0.40 m thickness, whereas the lowest was achieved on trial layer with\n0.50 m thickness even though a higher energy level was applied. These results\ndenote the influence of layer thickness on dry density regarding compaction\nequipment used. Concerning to embankment layers, all constructed with 0.40 m\nthickness, average moisture content ranged from 2% dry of optimum to opti-\nmum. It is noteworthy that to the lowest dry density achieved in 5th layer\ncorresponds to the higher moisture content.\n\nTable 7.1: State conditions of SP trial and embankment layers obtained from\nNM after calibration for the last energy level at each layer\n\nTrial layers [m] Embankment layers (0.40 m)\n0.30 0.40 0.50 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th\n\nNo. Passes 10 12 14 10 8 12 10 12\n?d [kN/m\n\n3] 20.02 20.96 19.84 19.40 18.77 19.46 19.56 20.57\nSD 0.37 1.06 0.60 0.57 0.52 0.40 0.05 0.26\nCV 1.9 5.0 1.3 2.9 2.8 2.1 0.3 1.3\nw [%] 7.5 8.3 5.6 11.7 12.5 11.5 9.4 10.1\nSD 1.02 1.12 1.40 1.10 1.90 0.83 0.57 0.79\nCV 13.6 13.4 25.1 9.4 15.2 7.2 6.0 7.8\n\nThe wetting process employed on SP material involved the previous stack of\nmaterial, water adding and mix up by means of a front shovel and, in addition,\nmoisture content was corrected in situ before compaction process.

It is noteworthy that modulus obtained from tests performed on\nISAC trial and base layer were about 63% and 56% than the corresponding\nvalues obtained from SP trial layer and base layer, respectively.\n\nTable 7.2: Average modulus ESPLT obtained from SPLT carried out on trial\nand base layers, for the last energy levels\n\nNo. of passes\nLayer Material 10 12 14\n0.40 m SP 92.8\n\nISAC 151.5\n0.50 m ISAC 149.4\nBase layer CA40 119.0\n\nISAC 185.8\n\n\n\n174 Field investigation: FTRE\n\n7.4 Moduli obtained from performance related\n\ntests\n\n7.4.1 LFWD, FWD, SSG and Portanceme?tre\n\nSimilarly to Chapter 6, statistical data (average and standard deviation,\nSD, and coefficient of variation, CV) was computed from moduli obtained from\nLFWD, SSG and Portanceme?tre and data is given in Appendix D for each trial\nlayer and for energy levels evaluated. The number of tests enabling statistic\ntreatment by layer and energy level were listed in Chapter 4.\n\nThe FWD modulus EFWD was computed and statistical data is also pre-\nsented in Appendix D. All tests were conducted starting with one seating load\nfollowed by one load drop at three different drop heights, generating this way\nthree different loads, in each station. A load plate with 0.45 m in diameter was\nused and a flexible load plate was considered.\n\n7.4.2 SASW\n\nWith the aim to perform a SASW test, SP capping layer was instrumented\nwith accelerometers on the surface. Six vertical receivers (accelerometers) were\nplaced on the ground and offset in incremental distances from a fixed center-\nline. Because the compacted layers of about 0.40 m are under consideration and\ntaking into account filtering criterion described in Chapter 2, the receivers were\noffset of 0.40 m, as is illustrated in Figure 7.5. All tests were performed on SP\ncapping layer inside grid L6.\n\nFigure 7.5: Setup adopted to perform SASW on SP capping layer inside grid\nL6\n\nSeveral tests were performed applying different impulsive loads in line with\nthe receivers at a distance away from the receiver equal to receivers spacing. Ac-\ntive Rayleigh wave data were generated using a light hammer, a sledge hammer,\nLFWD and FWD sources. To improve the signal\u2013to\u2013noise ratio, the impacts\nare repeated several times. A reverse test is also performed with the source in\nthe opposite side of the receiver array, when a light or sledge hammer source is\nused, in order to confirm the first test. Satisfactory results were obtained with\nlight hammer, LFWD and FWD sources.\n\nThe acquisition system was described in previous chapter.\n\n\n\nModuli obtained from performance related tests 175\n\nResults from test using a light hammer\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 7.6, a light hammer source generate high\u2013frequency\nRayleigh waves in the range of 10\u20131500Hz. This range is higher than the one\nobtained from SASW tests in ETRE (recall section 6.4.2).\n\n0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nF\no\n\nrc\ne\n\n [\nkN\n\n]\n\nTime [s]\n\n(a)\n\n0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500\n0\n\n0.002\n\n0.004\n\n0.006\n\n0.008\n\n0.01\n\n0.012\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\n\ne\n [\nkN\n\n/H\nz]\n\nFrequency [Hz]\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7.6: (a) Waveforms of signals and (b) respective spectrum generated\nusing a light hammer source\n\nEstimation of the dispersion curve was computed using three pairs of sig-\nnals, namely, 0.40-0.80m, 0.80\u20131.60m and 1.20\u20132.40m, which information was\nassembled considering filtering criterion, as described in Chapter 2. Experimen-\ntal dispersion curves corresponding to the first test and the reverse one (fig.\n7.7) were then obtained, where only fundamental mode was considered. Figure\n7.7 shows that no significant differences are seen between experimental curves\nobtained with first and reverse test. Therefore only results from first test were\nanalysed. Since the number of points in the composite dispersion curve is not\nmanageable for the successive inversion process, a polynomial regression was\nadopted.\n\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nFrequency [Hz]\n\nV\ns \n\n[m\n/s\n\n]\n\n(a)\n\n0 50 100 150 200 250\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nFrequency [Hz]\n\nV\ns \n\n[m\n/s\n\n]\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7.7: Experimental dispersion curves from SASW carried out on capping\nlayer inside grid L6 using light hammer: (a) first test ; (b) reverse test\n\nThe shear wave profile was computed using an iterative process described\n\n\n\n176 Field investigation: FTRE\n\npreviously in Chapter 2.

The lowest value of f\n1/2\nobj was achieved\n\nfor the shear wave profile corresponding to an earth model with one layer over\nhalfspace. From Table 7.3 it can be seen that a layer with thickness of 0.41 m\nis identified on the top, which corresponds to the capping layer.\n\nTable 7.3: Initial and final soil profile for first attempt including all stages in\nthe inversion procedure (light hammer test)\n\nInitial profile Final profile\n\nStage Layer d Vs ? d Vs ? f\n1/2\nobj\n\n1 1 ? 100 18.64 ? 181 18.64 11.1\n2 1 3 181 18.64 0.41 175 18.64 5.4\n\n2 ? 181 18.64 ? 195 18.64\n3 1 0.45 175 18.64 0.39 175 18.64 7.5\n\n2 3 195 18.64 1.98 194 18.64\n3 ? 195 18.64 ? 217 18.64\n\n4 1 0.39 175 18.64 0.38 175 18.64 11.1\n2 0.99 194 18.64 1.06 194 18.64\n3 0.99 194 18.64 1.03 197 18.64\n4 ? 217 18.64 ? 211 18.64\n\nThen, a new shear wave profile was computed using all data available for the\n\nembankment.

To this end, EV2 modulus from SPLT will be set\nas the reference value.\n\nIt should be noted that, before the establishment of correlations, being Por-\ntanceme?tre a continuous test, the data given by this equipment was treated in\nsuch a way to be possible to compare values with spot tests. In this sense,\nan average value of EPort modulus per grid was computed, in the same way\nas in the previous chapter. The methodology employed to the establishment\nof relationships between SPLT and performance related tests was based is the\nfollowing steps:\n\n(i) comparison between tests results performed in the same spot for all energy\nlevels;\n\n(ii) comparison between tests results performed in the same grid for all energy\nlevels;\n\n(iii) comparison between average values per energy level;\n\n(iv) perform previous iterations, yet only considering the last energy level.\n\nDue to the small dimensions of the trial, embankment and base layers, it\nseems to not make sense to group these values into homogeneous, as done for\nETRE. Once again, ever tests results are unavailable or established relationships\nat each step show high scatter will not be presented. The results analysis was\ndivided by type of material studied and is presented in the following sub sections.\n\n7.5.1 SP trial and embankment layers\n\nIn Figure 7.17 is shown the relationship between SPLT modulus (EV2) and\nPortanceme?tre and LFWD moduli (EPort and ELFWD), despite only two SPLT\navailable. Comparison between tests results on the same spot show a EV2 1.5\ntimes greater than ELFWD. On the other hand, a correlation close to unity\nobserved between EPort and ESPLT moduli, which means moduli given by both\ntest methods are similar. Thus, further relationships were attempted using\nPortanceme?tre as reference test, however, high scatter did not allowed the es-\ntablishment of correlations.\n\nFinally, moduli obtained from SASW is analysed. Interpretation of tests\nperformed on capping layer inside grid L6 resulted in moduli ranging from 135\nto 165 MPa. Inside the same grid, LFWD, SSG and Portanceme?tre were carried\nout and moduli equal to 57, 112 and 83 MPa were obtained respectively. When\nthese results are compared with SASW, significant differences are achieved.\nSASW modulus is approximately 160, 35 and 80% higher than LFWD, SSG\nand Portanceme?tre moduli. These differences are probably related with two\nfundamental aspects, namely, stress and deformation level applied by each test\nmethod. LFWD and Portanceme?tre applies higher stress and deformation levels\nthan SSG, thus attempting on non linear behaviour of SP material it results in\n\n\n\nCorrelation between E modulus for several tests 183\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\n125\n\n150\n\n50 75 100 125 150\n\nEPort and ELFWD [MPa]\n\nE\nV\n2\n  \n[M\nP\na\n]\n\nPortancem\u00e8tre\n\nLFWD\n\nFigure 7.17: Comparison between moduli obtained from SPLT with Por-\ntanceme?tre and LFWD performed on SP trial layers\n\nlower moduli. On the other hand, SSG applies lower stress levels and, therefore,\ncorrelation between ESSG and SASW modulus is the closest one.\n\n7.5.2 ISAC trial and embankment layers\n\nLikewise to SP material, correlations between moduli were carried out. Firstly,\nin Figure 7.18 EV2 modulus is plotted against EPort, ELFWD and ESSG moduli.\nESPLT modulus is higher, approximately 44%, than the corresponding values\nobtained with Portanceme?tre (EPort), despite lack of results to allow sustain-\nable conclusions. For this reason, it seems that calibration of Portanceme?tre\nwas not suitable for this type of material. Concerning moduli obtained from\nLFWD and SSG tests, these are fairly lower than the ones obtained from SPLT.\nAs one can see, EV2 is about two times ELFWD and more than two times ESSG.\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n0 50 100 150 200\n\nEPort, ELFWD and ESSG [MPa]\n\nE\nV\n2\n [\nM\nP\na\n]\n\nSSG\n\nLFWD\n\nPortancem\u00e8tre\n\nFigure 7.18: Comparison between moduli obtained from SPLT and Por-\ntanceme?tre, SSG and LFWD performed on ISAC trial layers\n\nOwing to the lack of SPLT results and likewise to SP material, Portanceme?tre\nwas used as reference test. In Figure 7.19, moduli given by Portanceme?tre,\nLFWD and SSG are compared. In Figure 7.19a correlation between EPort and\nELFWD moduli is established for average values per layer and energy level, where\n\n\n\n184 Field investigation: FTRE\n\npoor correlation is verified (R2 = 0.41).

Nevertheless, comparison with the corre-\nsponding values ELFWD, EFWD and ESSG obtained from tests performed inside\nthe same grid is conducted in Table 7.9. In addition, also average values are\ngiven. It should be noting that FWD modulus was gathered from second drop\nweight with corresponding stress below the plate of 193 kPa, which is closer to\nthe 200 kPa applyied on SPLT.\n\nTable 7.9: Moduli obtained from SPLT and performance related tests (LFWD,\nSSG and FWD) carried out on CA40 base layer: tests performed on the same\ngrid and average moduli\n\nEV2 ELFWD\nELFWD\nEV2\n\nESSG\nESSG\nEV2\n\nEFWD\nEFWD\nEV2\n\nE [MPa] 119.0 144.6 1.21 111.6 0.94 90.5 0.76\nAverage [MPa] 120.3 1.01 119.6 1.01 90.2 0.76\n\nOne can see that average ELFWD and ESSG are almost the same as EV2,\nthough moduli obtained in the same grid differed 21% and 6%, respectively.

The maximum relative compaction is achieved\nfor 6 passes for trial layers with 0.30 and 0.50 m, yet, concerning to the latter,\nmaximum moduli is only achieved for 12 passes.

Moduli (EPort) and state pa-\nrameters (relative compaction and moisture content deviation) evolution with\nnumber of passes: (a) Moduli and relative compaction; (b) Moduli and moisture\ncontent deviation\n\nFocusing on the analysis of moduli and relative compaction regarding all trial\nlayers, it seems that dry density has great influence on mechanical properties.\nModuli seems to follow dry density trends, i.e, increases with increasing dry\ndensity and vice\u2013versa. This trend is similar to the one verified for ETRE on\nSC trial layers (recall section 6.6).\n\nFurther, the influence of state parameters on mechanical performance is in-\nvestigated. To this end, in Figure 7.23 is plotted moduli and relative compaction\nagainst moisture content deviation for the last energy level for trial and embank-\nment layers.\n\nOne can see a wide range of state parameters. Moisture content devia-\ntion ranged from 6% dry of optimum to optimum, whereas relative compaction\nvaried between 102% and 113%. However, modulus appears to not vary signifi-\ncantly with moisture content. For example, relative compaction corresponding\nto moisture content deviation about 4%, 2% and 0.5% dry of optimum is quite\nsimilar, yet modulus is identical for the limits moisture contents and lower cor-\nresponding to 2.5% dry of optimum. Thereby, moisture content appears have\nunnoticeable influence on mechanical properties for the moisture content range\n\n\n\n186 Field investigation: FTRE\n\n4 6 8 10 12\n40\n\n55\n\n70\n\n85\n\n100\n\n115\n\nM\no\n\nd\nu\n\nlu\ns,\n\n E\n [\nM\n\nP\na\n\n]\n\nNo. of Passes\n\n \n\n \n\n4 6 8 10 12\n97\n\n102\n\n107\n\n112\n\n117\n\n122\n\nR\ne\n\nla\ntiv\n\ne\n c\n\no\nm\n\np\na\n\nct\nio\n\nn\n, \nR\n\nC\n [\n%\n\n]\n\nE\nPort\n\n?\nd SCM\n\n?\nd NM\n\n(a)\n\n4 6 8 10 12\n40\n\n55\n\n70\n\n85\n\n100\n\n115\n\nM\no\n\nd\nu\n\nlu\ns,\n\n E\n [\n\nM\nP\n\na\n]\n\nNo. of Passes\n\n \n\n \n\n4 6 8 10 12\n?6.0\n\n?4.0\n\n?2.0\n\n0.0\n\n+2.0\n\n+4.0\n\nM\no\n\nis\ntu\n\nre\n c\n\no\nn\n\nte\nn\n\nt \nd\n\ne\nvi\n\na\ntio\n\nn\n, \n\nw\n [\n\n%\n]\n\nE\nPort\n\nw\nSCM\n\nw\nNM\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7.21: Trial layer with 0.40 m thickness.

In contrast, relative compaction appears to influence mechanical\nproperties. Grouping results by similar moisture content deviation, namely,\nabout 4%, 2% and 1%, one can observe that modulus increase with increas-\ning relative compaction, i.e, dry density. An investigation of hydro\u2013mechanical\nbehaviour of SP material is required in order to justify these conclusions.\n\nFurther, regarding quality control state parameters and moduli scatter earn\nto be commented for last energy level. Concerning to SP trial layers the highest\ndry density CV was obtained from NM carried out on layer with 0.40 m thick-\nness, about 5%, whereas trial layers with 0.30 and 0.50 m thickness presented\nCV lower than 2%. Owing to embankment layers, a dry density CV lower than\n3% was achieved. As so, state parameters CV lie below the maximum values\ngiven by Brandl (1977), 5% for dry density determined by means of NM.

Trial layers presented identical modulus CV ranging\nfrom 6 to 8%, while embankment layers presented modulus CV ranging from\n4 to 9%. As so, moduli CV mainly lie below the required maximum given\nby Brandl (1977), which is 25%. No relation between state parameters and\nmodulus scatter was found.\n\nThe analysis of results from full scale trial allowed to conclude that the\nwetting process employed on SP did not produced desirable moisture content.\nProcess involved the previous stack of material, water adding and mix up by\nmeans of a front shovel and, in addition, moisture content was corrected in situ\nbefore compaction process. Still, this procedure did not always met the desirable\nmoisture content. Further, NM appear not to be appropriate for determination\nof state parameters of ISAC material.\n\nConcerning to mechanical evaluation, the reduced number of SPLT did not\nallowed the establishment of reliable correlations with performance related tests.\nNevertheless, a correlation close to unity was observed between SPLT and Por-\ntanceme?tre for tests carried out on SP, whereas on ISAC SPLT modulus was\nfound to be approximately 1.45 times modulus obtained from Portanceme?tre.\nThese results shows that an adequate calibration using SPLT is required. There-\nfore, it is recommended to conduct calibration during execution of trial embank-\nments. This notwithstanding, the quick execution and the immediate layout of\nthe results allowed quick intervention whenever the deformability conditions\nwere not achieved, which highlights the great advantage of this equipment, be-\nsides being a continuous method.\n\nPoor correlations with other performance related tests, namely LFWD and\nSSG, using Portanceme?tre as reference test were obtained due to high scatter.\nTherefore, the results from these equipments should be treated with caution.\n\n\n\n188 Field investigation: FTRE\n\n7.7 Comparison between full scale trial and lab-\n\noratory results\n\nLikewise to previous chapter, comparison between moduli obtained from full\nscale trial and laboratory tests are performed herein. To this end, stress and\nstrain levels on both field and laboratory tests are taken into account, as well\nas, state conditions.\n\nFirstly, comparison between modulus obtained from SASW carried out on\ncapping layer and modulus obtained from triaxial tests carried out in the aim of\na doctoral thesis (Reis Ferreira, 2010). The variation of secant modulus versus\ntotal vertical stress considering a strain level of 4 \u00d7 10?5 is given by Equation\n7.1.\n\nEsec = 211 \u00b7\n\n(\n\n?1\npa\n\n)0.64\n\n(7.1)\n\nTo take into account in situ stress and strain levels laboratory modulus was\ndetermined for a total vertical stress of 4.5 kPa, corresponding to an average\nvertical stress at the middle of the capping layer with 0.40 m thickness. Since\nsuction data is not available regarding SP material, a matric suction level similar\nto the one determined from SC material was adopted, about 20 kPa, in order\nto take into account unsaturated condition. As so, a laboratory modulus of\n86 MPa was obtained and then corrected for the same in situ void ratio. With\nregards to strain level, no correction was conducted since there are no available\nlaboratory results regarding in situ strain level involved in SASW test (1\u00d710?6).\nNevertheless, accordingly Ishibashi and Zhang (1993) degradation curves there\nis no significant modulus reduction these strain levels. The state conditions and\nmodulus determined from field and laboratory tests are summarized in Table\n7.10.\n\nTable 7.10: Field and laboratory state conditions and modulus regarding SP\ngeomaterial\n\nSASW on L6 Laboratory\nLight hammer LFWD FWD\n\n?

From Table 6.9 one can see that field modulus is about 5% to 50%\nhigher than laboratory modulus. However, these results should be treated with\ncaution due to simplifications adopted.\n\n\n\nField monitoring of roller drum and capping layer vibrations 189\n\nComparison between SPLT and laboratory results was conducted by Reis Fer-\nreira (2010) using the same procedure described previously. However, a stress\nlevel of 200 kPa and a strain level of 1 \u00d7 10?3 were considered. Laboratory\nmodulus was found to be about 10% to 27% greater than modulus obtained\nfrom SPLT on SP layers and ranged from 3% to 26% higher than modulus ob-\ntained from SPLT on ISAC layers. In the same manner, also modulus obtained\nfrom SSG was compared with laboratory results. Once again, laboratory results\nwere found to be about 13% higher than SSG modulus. In Figure 7.24 moduli\nobtained from laboratory tests are plotted against moduli obtained from field\ntests.\n\n50 75 100 125 150 175 200\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nModulus, E\nlab\n\n [MPa]\n\nM\no\n\nd\nu\n\nlu\ns,\n\n E\nfie\n\nld\n [\n\nM\nP\n\na\n]\n\n \n\n \n\nSP\nE\n\nSPLT\n\nE\nSSG\n\nASIC\nE\n\nSPLT\n\nFigure 7.24: Moduli obtained from SPLT performed on on SP and ISAC layers\nand SSG carried out on SP layers versus moduli obtained from laboratory tests\n\n7.8 Field monitoring of roller drum and capping\n\nlayer vibrations during compaction and ap-\nplication of dynamic loads\n\nAs described in Chapter 4, field monitoring of vibrations (vertical strains and\nvertical accelerations) was conducted in two phases. Phase One measurements\nwere carried out on capping layer in materials ISAC and SP during dynamic\ntests, namely, LFWD, FWD, Portanceme?tre and during roller drum vibration.\nPhase Two involved measurements of roller drum vibrations, as well as capping\nlayer vibrations during compaction of base layer.\n\n7.8.1 Phase One: Instrumentation\n\nThe instrumentation in this phase involved strain gauges and accelerometers.\nIt is important noting that while the former reflects both static and dynamic\nresponse, the latter only reflects dynamic response.\n\nThe setup adopted is illustrated in Figure 4.16a, in Chapter 4. One strain\ngauge was buried in the capping layer of SP profile at depth 0.43 m, while an-\nother strain gauge was buried in the capping layer of ISAC profile at depth\n0.45 m. Though the sensors depth were slightly different for the two profiles,\nthey are close enough to elicit comparison. It should be noted that these sensors\n\n\n\n190 Field investigation: FTRE\n\nwere not calibrated previously to its in\u2013ground placement, thus values presented\nhereafter are direct values given by sensors. In addition, two uniaxial accelerom-\neters were buried in the top and bottom of the capping layer. For SP profile\nprofile, the top and bottom accelerometers were placed at depth z = 0.10 m\nand z = 0.45 m, whereas for ISAC profile sensors were placed z = 0.22 m and\nz = 0.47 m. As so, bottom accelerometers also allows comparison, despite dif-\nferences in depth, while top accelerometers do not allow direct comparison. The\ncharacteristics of these accelerometers are given in Table 7.11.\n\nTable 7.11: Sensors characteristics used for vibration measurements\n\nDesignation Type Sensibility Measurement Frequency\n[V/g] range [g] range [Hz]\n\nin\u2013ground PCB 1 \u00b1 5 0.5 to\naccelerometers 623B13 1000\n\n7.8.2 Phase One: Test results\n\nLFWD\n\nFor both profiles, ISAC and SP, two LFWD tests were performed at surface\ncapping layer, one at strain gauges vertical alignment and another at accelerom-\neters vertical alignment, thereby enabling the evaluation of vertical in\u2013ground\nstrains and in\u2013ground accelerations. Each LFWD test consisted in at least six\nimpacts and a plate with 300 mm diameter was used.\n\nThe force versus displacement loops corresponding to one impact at each\nvertical alignment on both profiles are plotted in Figure 7.25. An average\nFpeak = 15 kN loading was measured for LFWD performed in the SP pro-\nfile, while an average Fpeak = 15.5 kN loading was measured for tests performed\nin ISAC profile, corresponding to average stress below the plate of 212 and\n219 kPa, respectively. It is interesting noting that significant differences be-\ntween plate displacements are observed, mainly those corresponding to LFWD\ntests performed in ISAC material, though spot tests were spaced of 0.50 m.\n\nFigure 7.26 illustrates the strain measurement during LFWD testing on both\nprofiles. In Table 7.12 is summarized data obtained from LFWD carried out at\nstrain gauges vertical alignment and respective in\u2013ground peak strains measure-\nments. Identical peak strains were measured in SP and ISAC profile (356\u00d710?6\n\nand 361\u00d710?6, respectively) reflecting similar modulus obtained from tests in-\nterpretation. Moreover, strain response stress ratio is approximately 1.67 for\nboth profiles. Despite different materials being tested, identical stress strain\nbehaviour is found from profiles at strain gauges vertical alignments.\n\nTable 7.12: Peak in\u2013ground strains measurements obtained from LFWD tests\ncarried out on SP and ISAC profiles\n\nMaterial Measurement Stress below ELFWD Peak strain\nprofile depth the plate [kPa] [MPa] [\u00d710?6]\nSP 0.43 m 212 62 356\nISAC 0.45 m 215 60 361\n\n\n\nField monitoring of roller drum and capping layer vibrations 191\n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\nDisplacement [\u00b5m]\n\nF\no\n\nrc\ne\n\n [\nkN\n\n]\n\n \n\n \n\nStrain gauge alignment\nAccelerometer alignment\n\n(a)\n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\nDisplacement [\u00b5m]\n\nF\no\n\nrc\ne\n\n [\nkN\n\n]\n\n \n\n \n\nStrain gauge alignment\nAccelerometer alignment\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7.25: Average LFWD force\u2013displacement loops from impacts at surface\ncapping layer on sensors vertical alignment at: (a) SP profile; (b) ISAC profile\n\n0.4 0.45 0.5 0.55 0.6 0.65\n?400\n\n?300\n\n?200\n\n?100\n\n0\n\n100\n\nTime [s]\n\nS\ntr\n\na\nin\n\n [\n\u00d71\n\n0\n?\n\n6\n]\n\n \n\n \n\nV05\nAc botV05\n\nAc top\n\nLFWD\n\n(a)\n\n0.4 0.45 0.5 0.55 0.6 0.65\n?400\n\n?300\n\n?200\n\n?100\n\n0\n\n100\n\nTime [s]\n\nS\ntr\n\na\nin\n\n [\n\u00d71\n\n0\n?\n\n6\n]\n\n \n\n \n\nV04\nAc botV04\n\nAc top\n\nLFWD\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7.26: Strains measurement during LFWD test in: (a) SP profile; (b)\nISAC profile\n\nThe acceleration time histories are presented in Figures 7.27a and 7.27b and\npeak acceleration data is given in Table 7.13. The acceleration data from top\naccelerometer in SP profile is not provided because exceeded the measurement\nrange of the sensor, which means acceleration peak was higher than 49.1 m/s2.\nThis was probably due to the lower depth of top accelerometer in SP profile\n(z = 0.10 m) than in ISAC profile (z = 0.22 m). One can see that peak from top\naccelerometer lags peak from bottom accelerometer due to wave propagation\nthrough profile. Further, in order to estimate displacements double integration\non frequency domain was conducted on accelerometers data (see figs. 7.27c\nand 7.27d) and computed peak displacements are given in Table 7.13. Negative\nvalues represent downward displacement.\n\nOne can see that both acceleration and displacement peaks decrease with in-\ncreasing depth. It is noteworthy at higher depth (0.43 and 0.45 m) the amplitude\nof upward acceleration exceeded the downward acceleration in SP profile and\nwas the same in ISAC profile , whereas at z = 0.22 m in ISAC profile down-\nward acceleration exceeded the upward acceleration.

Concerning\n\ndisplacements on ISAC profile, a reduction about 78% between peak negative\ndisplacements from top and bottom sensors is verified.\n\nComparison between in\u2013ground peak displacements from both profiles shows\nthat computed displacements at higher depth in SP profile is almost two times\nthe corresponding observed on ISAC profile, indicating thereby greater stiff-\nness from ISAC profile. In fact, a higher ELFWD was obtained on ISAC profile\nwhich is consistent with estimated displacements. However, computed displace-\nments differ by a factor of about 2.1, yet moduli only differ about 1.6, despite\napplied stress almost the same. Aiming to understand these differences, the-\noretical modulus, stress and strain were computed from static loading theory\napplied to a homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic half\u2013space. Accordingly to\nAchenbach (1999) cited by Mooney and Miller (2009) elastic theory consider-\ning static loading can be used for dynamic loading when the time for stress\nwaves through the volume of soil involved is much less than the duration of the\nload pulse. For LFWD testing on ISAC and SP materials, shear wave veloc-\nities of about 90 m.s?1 and 170 m.s?1, respectively, were estimated from time\n\n\n\nField monitoring of roller drum and capping layer vibrations 193\n\nTable 7.13: Peak in\u2013ground acceleration measurements and computed peak\ndisplacements obtained from LFWD tests carried out on SP and ISAC profiles\n\nMaterial Measure- Stress ELFWD Peak accele- Peak\nprofile ment below the [MPa] ration [m.s?2] displace-\n\ndepth [m] plate [kPa] acp+ acp? ment [mm]\nSP 0.45 212 54 18 14 0.145\nISAC 0.22 215 84 37 39 0.319\n\n0.47 15 15 0.069\n\nlag between LFWD sensors located at 300 and 600 mm far from the center of\nthe plate. Assuming a effective depth of 1.5D, travel times of 5.0 and 2.6 ms\nare about three to five times less than the load pulse duration (approximately\n13.5 ms). Therefore, static analysis using measured dynamic force provides a\nreasonable approximation to which the dynamic stress measurements can be\ncompared. Through equations 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4, theoretical stress and strain\nresponse beneath the center of a circular plate can be determined (Timoshenko\nand Goodier, 1951), where ?z, ?r and ?? are vertical, radial and tangential\nstresses, ?z is vertical strain, z is depth, E is Young modulus and ? is Poisson\nratio which is assumed to be 0.35 and R is the radius.\n\n?z =\n\n? 2?\n\n0\n\n?

Therefore, on one\nhand, ELFWD obtained from SP profile may be underestimated or, on the other\nhand, ELFWD obtained from ISAC profile may be overestimated.\n\nTo this end, observed differences can be explained by different contact stress\ndistributions between the plate and ISAC or SP materials. Moduli calculus\nwas carried out considering uniform contact stress distribution corresponding\nto flexible plate. However, elastic half\u2013space theory predicts inverse parabolic\ndistribution if a rigid plate is considered, although a parabolic stress distri-\nbution may be considered depending on material type being tested (Terzaghi,\n1943). The author suggested inverse parabolic distribution on cohesive soil and\nparabolic distribution on granular soil. Indeed, ISAC material is a granular\nmaterial where suction does not play significant role, thereby parabolic stress\ndistribution seems to be more suitable. As so, modulus and in\u2013ground strains\nwere computed considering uniform and parabolic stress distribution given by\nequations 7.5 and 7.6, respectively (Mooney and Miller, 2009). Results are\nsummarized in Table 7.14.\n\nq(r) =\n? \u00b7 R\n\n2 \u00b7 (R2 ? r2)0.5\n(7.5)\n\n\n\n194 Field investigation: FTRE\n\nq(r) =\n2 \u00b7 (R2 ? r2) \u00b7 ?\n\nR2\n(7.6)\n\nA ELFWD = 112 MPa is obtained on ISAC material, corresponding to ap-\nproximately 2.1 times ELFWD obtained from SP, which is similar to the obtained\ndisplacement relation. Further, relation between theoretical strains considering\nparabolic contact stress for ISAC and uniform contact stress for SP is approxi-\nmately 2.2. Therefore, it seems that parabolic contact stress distribution is more\nsuitable to LFWD tests performed in ISAC material when compared to LFWD\nresults obtained from SP material considering uniform stress distribution below\nthe plate.\n\nTable 7.14: In\u2013ground peak displacements computed from accelerometers sig-\nnals and respective theoretical and estimated strains at capping layer during\nLFWD tests\n\nSection ISAC SP\nAccelerometer Ac top Ac bot Ac bot\nDepth [m] 0.22 0.47 0.45\n? below the plate [MPa] 215 212\nPeak displacement, u (\u00b5m) 319 69 145\nPeak velocity, u?

In contrast, though computed displacements from\nacceleration data (145 and 69\u00b5m) and corresponding moduli (54 and 84 MPa)\nappears to be consistent, respective relations between measures, 2.1 and 1.6,\nindicate that modulus obtained on ISAC may be underestimated. Considering\nparabolic stress distribution below the plate, relation between moduli is found to\nbe 2.2. Therefore, it seems that parabolic stress distribution is more appropriate\nfor ISAC material when presenting high stiffness.\n\nFWD\n\nThe procedure adopted for FWD tests was the same described earlier for\nLFWD. FWD tests were performed at surface capping layer at the vertical\nalignment of strain sensors and accelerometers in both profiles. Tests were car-\nried out using a circular loading plate with a diameter of 450 mm and consisted\nin impact loads from three drop heights. Only one impact by each drop height\nwas performed. It should be noted that FWD test in SP profile was performed\nafter LFWD test, while FWD in ISAC profile test was carried out after roller\ndrum stationary vibration.\n\nFigure 7.28 shows the force versus displacement data gathered by the equip-\nment. Three force levels of approximately 20, 30 and 47 kN are generated. Good\nagreement between plate displacements from both tests performed on SP is ver-\nified. In contrast, plate displacements measured during tests on ISAC material\ndiffers significantly. In fact, plate displacements obtained from FWD carried\nout at strain vertical alignment are almost twice the corresponding value ob-\ntained from FWD carried out at accelerometer vertical alignment. This result\nwas unexpected since tests were spaced of 0.50 m. This may be attributed to ad-\nditional compaction during drum tests, since they were performed before FWD\ntests. Plate displacements obtained from FWD on ISAC profile are about a\nhalf and a third of plate displacements measured on SP material, which denotes\nlower deformability from ISAC material. Further, it is noteworthy that ISAC\nmaterial presents almost no viscosity.\n\nFigure 7.29 illustrates the strain time histories during FWD testing on ISAC\nand SP profiles. In Table 7.15 is summarized data obtained from these tests.\nIn both profiles strains increased with increasing stress applied by FWD de-\nvice corresponding to higher drop heights. Unexpectedly strains obtained from\nISAC profile are greater than obtained from SP profile, since ISAC profile was\nsupposed to have greater stiffness. In fact, FWD moduli obtained in ISAC pro-\nfile were almost two times the ones obtained in SP profile. Theoretical strains\nwere computed from static loading theory in order to understand these results.\nLoad pulse duration was about 33 ms, whereas the calculated travel times are\n4.0 to 7.5 ms, corresponding to four to seven times less, thereby, static loading\ntheory can be applied. Loading stresses were similar in both tests, thus, through\nthe equations 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4, lower strains levels are expected for profile with\n\n\n\n196 Field investigation: FTRE\n\n0 500 1000 1500 2000\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nDisplacement [\u00b5m]\n\nF\no\n\nrc\ne\n\n [\nkN\n\n]\n\n \n\n \n\nStrain\nAc\n\n(a)\n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nDisplacement [\u00b5m]\n\nF\no\n\nrc\ne\n\n [\nkN\n\n]\n\n \n\n \n\nStrain\nAc\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7.28: Average FWD force\u2013displacement loops from impacts at surface\ncapping layer on sensors vertical alignment at: (a) SP profile; (b) ISAC profile\n\nhigher modulus.

Values 3.16, 3.50 and\n3.70 were found from SP profile, whereas 6.41, 5.92 and 5.85 were obtained from\nISAC profile. As one can see, values for SP material seems to indicate that\nstrain response at z = 0.43 m is dependent on stress applied, where an increase\non stress applied results in strain softening response. This finding demonstrates\nnon linear behaviour of SP material at the evaluated depth range for in situ state\nconditions and stress levels applied. Regarding ISAC material, though strain\nresponse seems to be non linear too, a hardening response is observed. These\nsoftening and hardening response of SP and ISAC material, respectively, may\nbe explained from the stress dependency of soil stiffness. It is well documented\n\n\n\nField monitoring of roller drum and capping layer vibrations 197\n\nTable 7.15: Peak in\u2013ground strains measurements obtained from FWD tests\ncarried out on SP and ISAC profiles\n\nMaterial Measurement Stress below EFWD Peak strain\nprofile depth [m] the plate [kPa] [MPa] [\u00d710?6]\nSP 0.43 129 72 408\n\n187 60 655\n294 67 1087\n\nISAC 0.45 137 138 878\n199 132 1178\n300 141 1755\n\nthat soil stiffness increases with increasing confining stress and decreases with\nincreasing shear stress. Within each impact due to falling weight, the shear\nstress and confining stress increases. From the previous results it seems that\nthe decrease of stiffness due to increasing shear stress overlaps the increasing\nconfining stress effect for SP material, resulting in a softening response with\nincreasing stress. On the contrary, for ISAC material, the confining stress effect\nseems to superimpose to the increase of shear stress, leading to a hardening\neffect.\n\nOwing to FWD tests carried out at accelerometers vertical alignment, ac-\nceleration time histories and computed displacements are illustrated in Figure\n7.30. Also here acceleration and displacement data are not provided ever accel-\neration exceeded the measurement range of the sensor. In Table 7.16 is given\nacceleration and displacement peak data.\n\nOne can see that acceleration and displacement peaks increase with increas-\ning applied stress and decrease with increasing depth. Acceleration peaks ob-\ntained from in\u2013ground accelerometers in SP profile were higher than the ones\nobtained from in\u2013ground accelerometers in ISAC. In SP profile, acSPp? exceeded\n\nacSPp+ at both depths and the difference between peaks increased with increasing\n\ndrop height. Conversely, in ISAC profile acISACp+ exceeded ac\nISAC\np? at both sen-\n\nsors, with exception to result from accelerometer at z = 0.45 m corresponding\nto the 3rd drop height. Nevertheless, difference between peaks decreased with\nincreasing drop height. Likewise to acceleration data from LFWD tests, one\ncan see that peak from top accelerometer lags peak from bottom accelerometer\ndue to wave propagation through profile.\n\nA reduction of about 53% between top and bottom (0.22 m and 0.47 m) peak\ndisplacements is obtained in ISAC profile for all stress levels. With regards to\nSP profile, results available denotes a reduction of 66% between displacements\nobtained at z = 0.10 m and z = 0.45 m. Comparison between displacements\nfrom both profiles denote a different trend from strain results. Displacements on\nSP at z = 0.45 m ranged between 1.9 to 2.6 times the correspondent observed\non ISAC at z = 0.47 m, despite stress applied by equipment does not differ\nsignificantly. These results indicate higher stiffness from ISAC profile, which is\ntestified by higher moduli, about three times greater than corresponding moduli\nfrom SP profile.\n\nTaking into account conclusions regarding stress distribution below LFWD\nplate in previous section, the relations between displacements and moduli due\nto FWD tests were investigated too.

The effects of overburden and previous tests have been removed\nso the strain measurements presented here are due to the Portanceme?tre alone,\ni.e., strains at the beginning are equal to zero.\n\nFigure 7.31 illustrate total strains measurements during Portanceme?tre pass\non SP and ISAC profiles and respective cyclic portion. Peak strains are sum-\nmarized in Table 7.19. Both total and cyclic strains in ISAC profile were about\ntwice than those obtained in SP profile. This behaviour was unexpected since\nPortanceme?tre performed in each profile showed greater deformability of SP\nprofile. The ratio between cyclic and total strains were similar, about 30%.\n\nTable 7.19: Peak in\u2013ground strains measurements obtained from Portanceme?tre\ntests carried out on SP and ISAC profiles\n\nMaterial Measurement EPort Peak strain\nprofile depth [m] [MPa] [\u00d710?6]\nSP 0.43 Total 84 1107\n\nCyclic 335\nISAC 0.45 Total 102 2104\n\nCyclic 690\n\nIt is worth noting that in ISAC profile, material immediately in front of\nthe vibrating wheel experiences vertical extension, whereas in SP material this\nbehaviour is unnoticeable.

Double integration on frequency domain was conducted on data\ngathered from the accelerometers in order to compute the approximated dis-\nplacements (see figs. 7.32c and 7.32d). Negative values represent downward\ndisplacement. In Table 7.20 is given peak accelerations and displacements.\n\nAs observed previously for acceleration data, displacements are higher near\nthe point of load application and decrease as depth increases. A reduction of 70%\nand 75% between top and bottom peak displacements is verified, corresponding\nto SP and ISAC profiles, respectively. Further, displacements at z = 0.45 m in\n\n\n\n202 Field investigation: FTRE\n\nTable 7.20: Peak in\u2013ground acceleration measurements and computed peak\ndisplacements obtained from Portanceme?tre tests carried out on SP and ISAC\nprofiles\n\nMaterial Measure- EPort Peak accele- Peak\nprofile ment [MPa] ration [m.s?2] displace-\n\ndepth [m] acp+ acp? ment [mm]\nSP 0.10 84 21 13 0.281\n\n0.45 5 4 0.085\nISAC 0.22 102 17 13 0.199\n\n0.47 4 4 0.049\n\nSP profile is about 1.7 times the corresponding displacement obtained on ISAC\nprofile. This relation appears to reflect moduli obtained on both profiles, EPort\nfrom ISAC profile being about 1.2 times EPort from SP profile. Regarding to\ndisplacements at depth z = 0.10 m, displacements obtained in SP profile are\ngreater 1.3 times than the ones obtained in ISAC profile at z = 0.22 m. This\ntrend is contrary to the observed through strain data.\n\nIt is interesting noting that displacement computed from bottom accelerome-\nter on SP slightly decreased when Portanceme?tre loading is on vertical alignment\nof accelerometers. Displacements increased as Portanceme?tre approached, peaks\nat approximately 0.15 m away from sensor, slightly decreased to a local mini-\nmum when the roller was just above the sensor, increased as Portanceme?tre was\nmoving away, peaks again at approximately 0.15 m away from the sensor, and\ndecreased beyond this point. Beneath loading shear stress and strain are the-\noretically zero or very small compared with normal stresses and strains (John-\nson, 1987). Hence, it seems that strains induced by Portanceme?tre at depth\nz = 0.45 m when was approaching and moving away from the sensor results\nfrom shear and normal strains acting together.\n\nRoller drum\n\nVibrations measurements induced by vibratory roller were also carried out\non both SP and ISAC profiles. A Hamm 3412 smooth drum vibratory roller\nwas used during investigation. The total weight of the compactor is 12200 kg,\nwith the static weight under the front drum and rear tires equal to 6705 kg\nand 5495 kg, respectively. The drum is 1.504 in diameter and 2.140 m in width\nand houses an eccentric mass configuration that provides circular excitation at\nfrequencies of 30 and 40 Hz. Manually set eccentric configurations provide ec-\ncentric static moments ranging between 256 and 215 kN and nominal amplitudes\nbetween 1.91 and 0.90 mm, respectively. The drum\u2013frame connection configu-\nration is different on the right and left sides and access to a non\u2013rotating mount\nwas only possible on the left side (see fig. 7.33).\n\nBesides in\u2013ground instrumentation, one accelerometer was embarked on the\nroller in order to monitor its behaviour during vibrations measurements at this\nstage. This was embarked on the non\u2013rotating mount on the left side where\naccess was available. Taking into account the asymmetry of the drum, another\naccelerometer was placed on the top and at the middle of the drum in order to\ninvestigate the influence of sensor location.

The drum was allowed to apply vibratory\nloading during at least 4 seconds. The eccentric configuration was set in order\nto provide the lower eccentric static moment at the beginning of record. Then,\neccentric static moment was manually increased by the operator until roller\ndrum become to translate laterally. Therefore, for the sake of comparison of\n\n\n\n204 Field investigation: FTRE\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 7.33: Accelerometers embarked on roller drum: (a) scheme; (b) instru-\nmentation\n\ntests conducted in each profile, it should be bear in mind that each test did not\nhad the same eccentric static moment time history.\n\nIn Figure 7.34 is shown the in\u2013ground total and cyclic strain response, as well\nas, the acceleration and approximated displacements response during vibrating\nroller pass. In Table 7.22 peak data is summarized. Likewise to Portanceme?tre\nresults, the effects of overburden and previous tests have been also removed.\nAgain, data was referenced to each in\u2013ground sensor and abscissa reflects the\nposition of the roller drum. From strain response (figs. 7.34a and 7.34b) one can\nsee that cyclic response represents 98% of total strain response, which indicates\nthat drum remained in contact with the material during compaction. No plastic\nstrain was observed after roller pass. At sensor depth (z = 0.43 m) the width of\nthe zone of material influenced by the roller is about 0.70\u20130.80m.\n\nTable 7.22: Peak in\u2013ground strains and accelerations measurements and com-\nputed displacements obtained during drum pass over SP capping layer\n\nMeasu- Peak Peak acceleration Peak dis-\nrement strain [m.s?2] placement\ndepth [m] [\u00d710?6] acp+ acp?

On the contrary, positive peak acceleration\ngiven by bottom sensor is greater than negative peak. This fact denotes high non\nlinear behaviour (Mooney et al., 2005). Note that results show lower difference\nbetween negative and positive peaks, which tends to linear behaviour response.\nApproximated displacements were computed through double integration on fre-\nquency domain and are illustrated in Figure 7.34d.

From the time history\nacceleration data, peak values were gleaned for upward and downward in vertical\ndirection and are presented in Figure 7.35a. Following a positive down sign\nconvention, peak positive acceleration is downward and occurs when the drum\nis in the highest point in its trajectory. Conversely, peak negative acceleration\nis upward and occurs when the drum is at its lowest point.\n\nFocusing on frequency content, one can see that excitation frequency is about\n19 Hz. The analysis of the drum acceleration time history presented in Figures\n7.35c and 7.35d corroborates the results in frequency domain. Indeed, 19 Hz is\nabout half of the operation frequency of the roller, which ranges between 30 and\n40 Hz. As so, drum operating in periodic loss of contact, specifically, operat-\ning in double jump (Adam, 1996), was set as hypothesis. However, it is worth\nnoting that frequency content covers low to high eccentric static moments. Al-\nthough double jump operating mode is rather probable for high eccentric static\n\n\n\n206 Field investigation: FTRE\n\n0 1 2 3 4\n?50\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nTime [s]\n\nA\ncc\n\ne\nle\n\nra\ntio\n\nn\n [\n\nm\n.s\n\n?\n2\n]\n\n(a)\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nFrequency [Hz]\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\n\ne\n [\n\nm\n.s\n\n?\n2\n/H\n\nz]\n\n \n\n \n\nAc drum\nAc top\nAc bot\n\n(b)\n\n0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n?10\n\n?5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nTime [s]\n\nA\ncc\n\ne\nle\n\nra\ntio\n\nn\n [\n\nm\n.s\n\n?\n2\n]\n\n(c)\n\n3 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5\n?50\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nTime [s]\n\nA\ncc\n\ne\nle\n\nra\ntio\n\nn\n [\n\nm\n.s\n\n?\n2\n]\n\n(d)\n\n0 1 2 3 4\n?5\n\n?2.5\n\n0\n\n2.5\n\n5\n\nTime [s]\n\nD\nis\n\np\nla\n\nce\nm\n\ne\nn\n\nt \n[m\n\nm\n]\n\nAc botV05\n\nAc top\n\nRoller\ndrum Ac drum\n\n(e)\n\nFigure 7.35: Vibration response on SP test bed during drum vibratory load-\ning: (a) peak acceleration time history; (b) acceleration frequency spectrum;\n(c) acceleration time history; (d) acceleration time history; (e) approximated\ndisplacements\n\nmoments, for low eccentric static moments, probability is lower. Nevertheless,\ncontinuous compaction control still may be applied in double jump operating\nmode (Adam, 1996). Taking into account the strain results during roller pass,\nit is believed that roller drum was in contact with the ground during vibration.\n\n\n\nField monitoring of roller drum and capping layer vibrations 207\n\nAnother explanation might be an improperly operation of the excitation system.\nThese hypothesis could not be confirmed since the roller was no longer available\nat the time of this analysis.\n\nOwing to the acceleration time history on SP profile illustrated in Figure\n7.35a, acceleration peak decreases with depth. Differences between peak positive\n(acdp+ ) and negative accelerations (acdp?) of the accelerometer embarked on\nthe roller drum yields non linear behaviour of the coupled drum\u2013soil system.\nNote that acdp? exceeds acdp+ for lower eccentric static moments, while the\nopposite is observed for greater eccentric static moments . The nonlinearity of\nthe coupled roller drum\u2013soil system media distorts the output of a sinusoidal\ninput forcing function. The distortion is manifested in harmonic content within\ndrum vibration response spectra (Ewins, 2000; Mooney et al., 2005), as can be\nobserved from frequency content in Figure 7.35b.\n\nAnother behavioural characteristic from acceleration time history is worth\nnoting. Beyond the 3 seconds, the acdp? remains almost constant, despite in-\ncreasing eccentric static moment. On the contrary, acdp+ fairly increased. Thus,\nsurface deformation seems to remain almost constant, despite increasing vibra-\ntion force. This is confirmed by the approximated displacements determined in\nfrequency domain which remain almost constant beyond 3 seconds, as can be\nseem in Figure 7.35e.\n\nRegarding in\u2013ground accelerometers, differences between acdp+ and acdp?\nof the top accelerometer (z = 0.10 m) are noticeable for higher eccentric static\nmoment and remained almost constant beyond 2.5 seconds. No significant dif-\nferences were seen for lower eccentric static moments (fig. 7.35c). On the other\nhand, acdp? (32 m.s\n\n?2) exceeds acdp+ (24 m.s\n?2) in 33% for higher eccentric\n\nstatic moments (fig. 7.35d). This seems to indicate non linear behaviour at\nz = 0.10 m for lower vibrations forces, while increasing vibration forces yields\nincreasing non linear behaviour. Concerning to acceleration at z = 0.45 m, dif-\nferences between acdp+ and acdp? are unnoticeable during increasing of eccentric\nstatic moment, which seems to reflect linear behaviour. Along with the other\nsensors, peak accelerations from accelerometer at z = 0.45 m remain constant\nfor higher eccentric static moment.\n\nThese findings indicate non linear behaviour below the drum for the applied\neccentric static moments during vibration on SP test bed. Further, non linear\nbehaviour at depth z = 0.10 m for higher vibration forces is observed, while at\ndepth z = 0.45 m linear behaviour seems to be present for the applied eccen-\ntric static moments. In addition, for greater eccentric static moments, drum\npeak negative acceleration and in\u2013ground peak acceleration remained almost\nconstant, i.e., deformation remained almost constant (see fig. 7.35e). This indi-\ncates non linear relationship between vibration force applied by the drum and\ndeformation below the drum and in depth.\n\nFor ISAC profile only stationary vibration test was performed. Time and\nfrequency content of acceleration responses due to drum vibratory loading are\npresented in Figure 7.36, as well as approximated displacements computed from\nacceleration data. The frequency content of the drum acceleration presented in\nFigure 7.36b given by either accelerometer on the left side of the drum or the\naccelerometer placed on the top at the middle shows a peak amplitude about\n19 Hz indicating that drum was operating at this frequency. The acceleration\ntime history illustrated in Figure 7.36e confirms this finding.\n\nConcerning to the drum acceleration measurement, Figure 7.36a presents\n\n\n\n208 Field investigation: FTRE\n\n0 1 2 3 4\n?60\n\n?40\n\n?20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\nTime [s]\n\nA\ncc\n\ne\nle\n\nra\ntio\n\nn\n [\n\nm\n.s\n\n?\n2\n]\n\n(a)\n\n0 50 100 150\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nFrequency [Hz]\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\n\ne\n [\n\nm\n.s\n\n?\n2\n/H\n\nz]\n\n \n\n \n\nAc drum\nAc drum top middle\nAc top\nAc bot\n\n(b)\n\n0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n?20\n\n?10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\nTime [s]\n\nA\ncc\n\ne\nle\n\nra\ntio\n\nn\n [\n\nm\n.s\n\n?\n2\n]\n\n(c)\n\n3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 4\n?50\n\n?25\n\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\nTime [s]\n\nA\ncc\n\ne\nle\n\nra\ntio\n\nn\n [\n\nm\n.s\n\n?\n2\n]\n\n(d)\n\n0 1 2 3 4\n?1.5\n\n?1\n\n?0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nTime [s]\n\nD\nis\n\np\nla\n\nce\nm\n\ne\nn\n\nt \n[m\n\nm\n]\n\nAc botV05\n\nAc top\n\nRoller\ndrum Ac drum\n\nAc drum top mid\n\n(e)\n\n3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 4\n?1.5\n\n?1\n\n?0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nTime [s]\n\nD\nis\n\np\nla\n\nce\nm\n\ne\nn\n\nt \n[m\n\nm\n]\n\n(f)\n\nFigure 7.36: Vibration response on ISAC test bed during drum vibratory load-\ning: (a) peak acceleration time history; (b) acceleration frequency spectrum; (c)\nand (d) acceleration time history; (f) and (e) approximated displacements\n\npeak accelerations given by accelerometers placed on the left side of the drum\nand at the top at the middle of the drum. One can see that acceleration from\nboth sensors slightly differs. Acceleration given by accelerometer located at the\nleft side is greater than acceleration given by the sensor located at the top at the\nmiddle of the drum for lower eccentric static moments and tends to be almost\nthe same for higher eccentric static moments. Since the acceleration level during\n\n\n\nField monitoring of roller drum and capping layer vibrations 209\n\ntests carried out on ISAC afterwards were close to the values reached for higher\neccentric static moments in this measurement, the location of the accelerome-\nter has almost no influence on acceleration results. However, from computed\ndisplacements illustrated in Figure 7.36e, one can see that displacement deter-\nmined from accelerometer located on the left side of the drum is about 85%\nof the displacement exhibited on the top and at the middle of the drum. It is\nworth noting that signal from accelerometers placed on the left side of the drum\non the non\u2013rotation mount showed higher noise levels, as can be confirmed from\ndrum acceleration time and frequency content in Figures 7.36b and 7.36d.\n\nIn contrast to the observed in measurements carried out in SP test bed for\nlower eccentric static moments, differences between acdp+ and acdp? given by\nsensors embarked on the roller drum were unnoticeable till acceleration level\nabout \u00b120 m.s?2, yielding, therefore, linear behaviour of the coupled drum\u2013soil\nsystem. In Figure 7.36a can be seen that beyond this point, as acceleration level\nincreases acdp+ becomes greater than acdp? indicating non linear behaviour.\n\nAcceleration measurements in depth at ISAC test bed showed a different\ntrend from the results seen previously in SP test bed. Although for lower ec-\ncentric static moments acceleration peak decreases with depth, as expected,\nfor greater eccentric static moments acdp+ follow the same trend, while acdp?\nslightly increased with depth, as illustrated in Figure 7.36a . Regarding sensor\nlocated at z = 0.22 m, differences between acdp+ and acdp? were significant.\nOn the other hand, despite no significant differences between peak accelera-\ntions given by accelerometer at z = 0.45 m were seen for the lowest eccentric\nstatic moments, acdp? become greater with increasing eccentric static moment.\nThis notwithstanding, the approximated computed displacements followed the\nnormal trend, since a decreased with increasing depth is observed in Figure\n7.36e. In fact, for the greatest eccentric static moment applied, approximated\ndisplacement at depths z = 0.22 m and z = 0.45 m were approximately 0.40 and\n0.28 mm, corresponding to 47% and 33% of the surface displacement determined\nfrom accelerometer on left side of the drum (0.85 mm), as shown in Figure 7.36f,\nand a reduction of 30% between in\u2013ground displacements.\n\nFrom results obtained at ISAC test bed, differences between peak accelera-\ntions obtained with accelerometers located on the drum and at depth z = 0.22 m\nindicate non linear behaviour when applied eccentric static moments similar to\nthe compaction process. On the contrary, results obtained from accelerometer\nlocated at z = 0.45 m indicate linear behaviour.\n\n7.8.3 Phase One: Comparison between tests results\n\nIn Tables 7.23 and 7.24 are summarized data gathered during performance\nof different mechanical tests by material type, SP and ISAC, attempting to\nestablish relation between in\u2013ground measurements. Due to different loading\nnature, comparison will be conducted accordingly loading type, namely, impact\nloads (LFWD and FWD) and vibrating loads (Portanceme?tre and roller drum).\nNevertheless, strain measurements from both profiles allow to conclude that\ntests are ordered by increasing induced strains, which seems to indicate that\nroller drum has the higher depth influence, whereas LFWD has the lowest.\n\nMoreover, in\u2013ground displacements obtained from acceleration measurements\nwere consistent with profiles stiffness. Higher in\u2013ground displacements were\nfound regarding SP profile than in ISAC profile, which is consistent with lower\n\n\n\n210 Field investigation: FTRE\n\nmodulus obtained in the former than the latter. Hence, in\u2013ground dynamic\nresponse reflect moduli obtained from dynamic tests performed at layer surface.\n\nTable 7.23: In\u2013ground peak strains, accelerations and computed displacements\nobtained during performance of different mechanical tests on SP capping layer\n\nTests Displacement (accelerometers) Strain gauges\nz = 0.10 m z = 0.43 m E z = 0.45 m E\n\n[mm] [mm] [MPa] [\u00d710?6] [MPa]\nLFWD* 212 kPa 0.145 54 356 62\nFWD** 129 kPa 0.507 0.173 67 408 72\n\n187 kPa 0.278 70 655 70\n294 kPa 0.463 72 1087 67\n\nPortan- Total 84 1107 84\nceme?tre Cyclic 0.281 0.085 670\nRoller Total 1903\ndrum Cyclic 1.100 0.700 1873\n* Plate with 0.30 m diameter\n\n** Plate with 0.45 m diameter\n\nTable 7.24: In\u2013ground peak strains, accelerations and computed displacements\nobtained during performance of different mechanical tests on ISAC capping\nlayer\n\nDisplacement (accelerometers) Strain gauges\nTests z = 0.22 m z = 0.45 m E z = 0.47 m E\n\n[mm] [mm] [MPa] [\u00d710?6] [MPa]\nLFWD* 215 kPa 0.319 0.069 84 361 60\nFWD** 147 kPa 0.193 0.091 199 878 138\n\n205 kPa 0.258 0.124 209 1178 132\n306 kPa 0.361 0.175 230 1755 141\n\nPortan- Total 102 2104 102\nceme?tre Cyclic 0.199 0.049 1380\n* Plate with 0.30 m diameter\n\n** Plate with 0.45 m diameter\n\nComparison between LFWD and FWD results\n\nPrior to results analysis it should be noted that tests on SP profile were\ncarried out ordered in the following way: LFWD, FWD, Portanceme?tre and\nroller drum. In contrast, tests on ISAC profile were carried out by the following\norder: LFWD, Portanceme?tre, roller drum and FWD.\n\nFocusing on SP profile, it is noteworthy that moduli obtained from LFWD\non strain and accelerometers vertical alignments spaced of 0.50 m are similar, as\nmoduli obtained from FWD are similar too. To this end mechanical properties\nof this profile may be considered homogeneous. This conclusion is corroborated\nby relations between in\u2013ground measurements given in Table 7.25. Displacement\nresponse stress ratio (u?/?) and strain response stress ratio (?/?) were computed\nin order to eliminate response stress dependence.\n\n\n\nField monitoring of roller drum and capping layer vibrations 211\n\nTable 7.25: comparison of displacement and strain response stress ratio obtained\nfrom LFWD (300 mm loading plate diameter) and FWD (450 mm loading plate\ndiameter)\n\nSection Sensor u?/? u?/?FWD\nu?/?LFWD\n\n?/? ?/?FWD\n?/?LFWDdepth [m] LFWD FWD LFWD FWD\n\nSP 0.43 1.35 3.16\nand 0.68 1.49 2.19 1.68 3.50 2.08\n0.45 1.57 3.70\n\nISAC 0.22 1.41\n1.48 1.30 0.88\n\n1.20\n0.45 0.66 6.41\nand 0.32 0.62 1.94 1.66 5.92 3.57\n0.47 0.58 5.85\n\nOne can see that both u?/? and ?/? obtained at z = 0.43 m from FWD test\nis about twice (2.19 and 2.08) the corresponding value obtained from LFWD\ntest. These relations are close to that predicted from homogeneous, isotropic,\n\nlinear elastic theory considering a single modulus, which led to a\n?/?FWD\n?/?LFWD\n\nof\n\n1.80. Nevertheless, relations between in\u2013ground strains and displacements are\nsimilar showing, thereby, measurements consistency with both type of sensors.\nFurther, one can see that both in\u2013ground strains and displacements at bot-\ntom of the layer are higher due to FWD test, even though lower stress levels\nare applied concerning first and second drop heights. These results denote the\ngreater depth influence from plate with high diameter. Indeed, taking into\naccount homogeneous profile and considering a single modulus, theoretical ap-\nproach (equations 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4) corroborate these results. To this end, even\nthough moduli obtained from LFWD and FWD carried out on SP profile dif-\nfers, in\u2013ground measurements with both strain gauges and accelerometers show\nconsistency with theoretical approach considering a single modulus. As so, this\nresults highlight the importance of tests methods calibration to a reference test.\n\nWith regards to ISAC profile the same analysis was attempted. However,\nsignificant LFWD and FWD moduli is verified for both vertical alignments.\nThis is probably due to roller drum stationary vibration which was carried out\nbetween LFWD and FWD tests and may have induced significant differences\non profile mechanical behaviour. Moreover, even though tests were conducted\non spots spaced 0.50 m, moduli noticeably differs and, thereby, homogeneity can\nnot be assumed. To this end, theoretical approach was conducted using moduli\nobtained from each test.\n\nAt ISAC section u?/? obtained at z = 0.22 m from both tests were similar,\nonly differing about 12%, yet higher values were obtained for LFWD test. The\nrelation given by theoretical approach reveals a difference of about 40%. This\nnotwithstanding, these results shows consistency. At bottom of the capping\n\nlayer (z = 0.45 and 0.47 m) a\nu?/?FWD\nu?/?LFWD\n\nclose to 2 was found. However, theoretical\n\nvalues revealed a relation close to 0.80. Moreover, at the same depth ?/?FWD\nwas over three times greater than ?/?LFWD, while theoretical approach shows a\nrelation of 0.80. These results are not consistent with static linear elastic theory.\n\n\n\n212 Field investigation: FTRE\n\nAs so, results from ISAC profile showed inconsistency with theoretical approach,\nwhich might be due to significant mechanical properties changes induced by\nstationary vibrating.\n\nComparison between Portanceme?tre and roller drum results\n\nStrain measurements and computed displacements during roller drum and\nPortanceme?tre passes are directly compared only for SP profile, since measure-\nments during roller drum pass on ISAC profile are not available.\n\nRegarding strain response at bottom of SP capping layer, total peak strain\ninduced by Portanceme?tre is about 58% of corresponding value induced by roller\ndrum, whereas cyclic strain induced from the former represents 36% of the latter.\nThese results demonstrates either greater depth of influence and greater stress\napplyied by the roller drum. Further, it is interesting to note that at strain\nsensors depth the width of the zone of material influenced by Portanceme?tre is\nabout 0.90\u20131.0m, whereas the width of the zone of material influenced by the\nroller drum is on the order of 0.70\u20130.80m.\n\nConcerning to approximated vertical displacements higher differences are\nverified. At the top of capping layer (z = 0.10 m) peak negative displacements\ninduced by Portanceme?tre were found to be 25% of displacements induced by\nroller drum, while at bottom of capping layer (z = 0.45 m) Portanceme?tre in-\nduced displacements are only 12% of the ones induced by roller drum. A similar\ndynamic in\u2013ground response is found at higher depth. Since roller drum and\nPortanceme?tre wheel dynamic behaviour reflects dynamic in\u2013ground response,\nthis fact might indicate a good correlation between mechanical properties de-\ntermined from instrumented rollers and Portanceme?tre. It is noteworthy that\nthis relation is one third of the one found from strain results.\n\nThough peak accelerations are not presented in Tables 7.23 and 7.24, com-\nparison between measurements during vibration pass of both equipments are\ncompared too. From top accelerometer (z = 0.10 m) peak negative and positive\nacceleration levels corresponding to Portanceme?tre pass were 13 and 20 m.s?2,\nrespectively, whereas values corresponding to roller drum pass were 49 and\n32 m.s?2. From bottom accelerometer (z = 0.45 m) peak negative and positive\nacceleration levels corresponding to Portanceme?tre pass were 4 and 5 m.s?2,\nrespectively, whereas values corresponding to roller drum pass were 18 and\n21 m.s?2. It is noteworthy that positive peak value is greater than negative\npeak value during Portanceme?tre pass, while the opposite is verified during\nroller drum pass. In contrast, at z = 0.45 m positive peak values are greater\nthan negative peak values during both equipment passes. These features indi-\ncate different type of responses to vibrating load at z = 0.10 m and z = 0.45 m,\nwhich is probably due to stress\u2013strain levels induced by each equipment. At\ngreater depth differences between peak values decrease which might be associ-\nated to a stress\u2013strain behaviour close to linear. The greater differences observed\nat lower depth are related to nonlinear stress\u2013strain behaviour. Indeed, from\nstrains measurement, roller drum seems to induce higher stresses.\n\n7.8.4 Phase Two: Instrumentation\n\nThe setup adopted in this phase is illustrated in Figure 4.16b of Chapter 4.\nEither in\u2013ground strain gauges and accelerometers placed at bottom of the\n\n\n\nField monitoring of roller drum and capping layer vibrations 213\n\ncapping layer (at depth 0.45 m in Phase One) were left in same position, while\nthe accelerometers in the top of the capping layer were replaced by new strain\ngauges. As so, the same setup was implemented for both ISAC and CA40+SP\nprofiles, where two strain gauges were placed at 0.32 m from the surface of\nthe base layer and another strain gauge and one accelerometer were located at\n0.65 m depth. In addition, another strain gauge was buried in the capping layer\nbelonging to profile ISAC+SP at 0.32 m depth from the surface of base layer.\nThis operation was carried out after material placement and before roller passes.\n\nBesides in\u2013ground instrumentation, one accelerometer was embarked on the\nroller on the non rotating mount on the left side, in order to monitor its be-\nhaviour during compaction. However, high noise level was detected on the\nacceleration signal during pass 1. The author became aware of this problem\nand it was found to be due to a wire problem. Therefore, data from roller drum\nduring this pass was discarded. In order to prevent malfunction of one sensor,\ntwo accelerometers (Ac drum 1 and Ac drum 2) were embarked on the drum\nduring further passes (2 to 10). Frequency domain features were determined\nfrom the vibration histories of both accelerometers. Frequency content of the\nraw acceleration data of the drum collected from one of the passage of the roller\nis shown in Figure 7.37. From these figures some issues earn to be comment.\n\nOne can see from frequency content that accelerometer Ac drum 2 only shows\npeak magnitude for frequencies of interest, specifically the drum frequency and\nits harmonics. On the other hand, frequency content of accelerometer Ac drum\n1 shows high magnitude for low frequencies, between 0 and 10 Hz. Due to the\nhigh noise level on raw data from accelerometer Ac drum 1, hereafter drum\nacceleration is referred as data gathered from accelerometer Ac drum 2. In\naddition, it can be seen that the drum excitation frequency is approximately\n19 Hz, similarly to the verified in previous tests with the roller. This issue was\nreported in the previous section.\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nFrequency [Hz]\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\n\ne\n [\nm\n\n.s\n?\n\n2\n/H\n\nz]\n\n \n\n \nAc drum 1\nAc drum 2\n\n(a)\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nFrequency [Hz]\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\n\ne\n [\nm\n\n.s\n?\n\n2\n/H\n\nz]\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7.37: Frequency content of raw drum acceleration data collected from\none of the pass of the roller on: (a) CA40; (b) ISAC base layers\n\nThe characteristics of either accelerometers embarked on the drum and in\u2013\nground accelerometers are given in Table 7.26.

However,\ndue to wire problems with accelerometer embarked on drum during pass 1 of the\nvibrating roller, as reported previously, only data from vibrating roller passes 2\nto 10 will be presented.\n\nTaking into account that roller had no positioning system and roller velocity\nwas not recorded, in\u2013ground sensors were used as reference to positioning the\nroller drum. In this way, roller velocity was estimated from time lag between the\ndrum and wheels of the roller passing over strain gauges at each profile. Then,\ndata was referenced to the middle of each set of in\u2013ground sensors. Thus, data\nto be presented corresponds to the traveled distance by the roller over each set\nof in\u2013ground sensors, i.e., over each different profile.\n\nTime and frequency domain features were determined from the vibration\nhistories. The abscissa in following time history figures reflects the position of\nthe drum relative to in\u2013ground sensors location. The roller is traveling left to\nright, thus, negative x indicate that the drum is approaching the sensors. The\ndrum is directly above the middle of the set of sensors at x = 0 and positive x\nindicate that drum is moving away from the sensors.\n\nComputed velocities show that instrumented vibratory roller was driven over\nbase layer at varying speeds 0.18 to 0.30 m.s?1. Peak vertical drum acceleration\namplitudes measured at the three profiles (ISAC, ISAC+SP and CA40+SP)\nduring each pass ranged from 15 to 30 m.s?2 and are shown in Figure 7.38.\nNote that these acceleration levels are in the range of the ones given by Mooney\net al. (2005) and Mooney and Rinehart (2007). As mentioned previously, dou-\nble integration on frequency domain was conducted on data gathered from the\naccelerometers in order to compute the approximated displacements. In Fig-\nure 7.39 computed peak vertical displacements from accelerometer embarked on\nthe drum are illustrated for the three profiles. Statistical data (average, stan-\ndard deviation and coefficient of variation) regarding peak accelerations and\ndisplacements is given in Tables D.17 and D.18 in Appendix D.\n\nBoth drum acceleration and displacement decreases with increasing number\nof passes, as shown in Figure 7.40. Since, peak negative acceleration occurs\nwhen the drum is at the bottom in its trajectory, i.e., during rebound from the\nground, hereafter peak negative vertical drum acceleration (acd?p ) will be used\nas reference. Time domain analysis showed that as base layer was transformed\nfrom its placed state (near Pass 2) to a compacted state (Pass 10), average\n\n\n\nField monitoring of roller drum and capping layer vibrations 215\n\n?0.6 ?0.4 ?0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6\n?30\n\n?20\n\n?10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nx [m]\n\nA\ncc\n\ne\nle\n\nra\ntio\n\nn\n [\nm\n\n.s\n?\n\n2\n]\n\n(a)\n\n0 20 40 60 80\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nFrequency [Hz]\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\n\ne\n [\nm\n\n.s\n?\n\n2\n/H\n\nz]\n(b)\n\n?0.6 ?0.4 ?0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6\n?30\n\n?20\n\n?10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nx [m]\n\nA\ncc\n\ne\nle\n\nra\ntio\n\nn\n [\nm\n\n.s\n?\n\n2\n]\n\n(c)\n\n0 20 40 60 80\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nFrequency [Hz]\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\n\ne\n [\nm\n\n.s\n?\n\n2\n/H\n\nz]\n\n(d)\n\n?0.6 ?0.4 ?0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6\n?30\n\n?20\n\n?10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nx [m]\n\nA\ncc\n\ne\nle\n\nra\ntio\n\nn\n [\nm\n\n.s\n?\n\n2\n]\n\n(e)\n\n0 20 40 60 80\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nFrequency [Hz]\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\n\ne\n [\nm\n\n.s\n?\n\n2\n/H\n\nz]\n\n(f)\n\n1 pass 2 pass 4 pass 6 pass 8 pass 10 pass\n\nFigure 7.38: Time and frequency histories of vertical drum acceleration during\nsuccessive passes of the roller compacter on the three profiles: (a) ISAC; (b)\nISAC+SP; (c) CA40+SP\n\nacd?p decreased about 19% on ISAC and ISAC+SP profiles and about 8% on\nCA40+SP profile.

Concerning to vibration results for the last pass\nof vibrating roller (10 Pass), average acd?p on ISAC profile was 15 m.s\n\n?2 and in-\ncreased 22 and 46% for ISAC+SP and CA40+SP profiles, respectively.Vertical\ndrum displacements during compaction of ISAC profile is about \u00b11 mm, while\nincreases approximately 30 and 50%, up to \u00b11.3 and \u00b11.5 mm, during com-\npaction of profiles ISAC+SP and CA40+SP, respectively.\n\nThe decrease of both peak drum accelerations and displacements verified ei-\nther towards increasing number of passes and with different underlying materials\ncan be related with stiffness. It is known that materials stiffens with number\nof passes of the roller. In fact, moduli obtained from SPLT carried out for 10\npasses were the highest on ISAC profile. Moreover, moduli obtained from SPLT\nperformed in ISAC section (ESPLT = 185 MPa) is approximately 50% greater\n\n\n\nField monitoring of roller drum and capping layer vibrations 217\n\n2 4 6 8 10\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\n\nA\nve\n\nra\ng\n\ne\n a\n\ncc\ne\n\nle\nra\n\ntio\nn\n\n, \na\n\ncd\n [\n\nm\n.s\n\n?\n2\n]\n\nNo. of Passes\n\n \n\n \n\n2 4 6 8 10\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\nA\nve\n\nra\ng\n\ne\n d\n\nis\np\n\nla\nce\n\nm\ne\n\nn\nt,\n\n z\nd\n\n [\nm\n\nm\n]\n\nacd+ acd? zd+ zd?\n\n(a)\n\n2 4 6 8 10\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\n\n28\n\nA\nve\n\nra\ng\n\ne\n a\n\ncc\ne\n\nle\nra\n\ntio\nn\n\n, \na\n\ncd\n [\n\nm\n.s\n\n?\n2\n]\n\nNo. of Passes\n\n \n\n \n\n2 4 6 8 10\n1.1\n\n1.3\n\n1.5\n\n1.7\n\n1.9\n\n2.1\n\nA\nve\n\nra\ng\n\ne\n d\n\nis\np\n\nla\nce\n\nm\ne\n\nn\nt,\n\n z\nd\n\n [\nm\n\nm\n]\n\nacd+ acd? zd+ zd?\n\n(b)\n\n2 4 6 8 10\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\n\n28\n\nA\nve\n\nra\ng\n\ne\n a\n\ncc\ne\n\nle\nra\n\ntio\nn\n\n, \na\n\ncd\n [\n\nm\n.s\n\n?\n2\n]\n\nNo. of Passes\n\n \n\n \n\n2 4 6 8 10\n1.1\n\n1.3\n\n1.5\n\n1.7\n\n1.9\n\n2.1\n\nA\nve\n\nra\ng\n\ne\n d\n\nis\np\n\nla\nce\n\nm\ne\n\nn\nt,\n\n z\nd\n\n [\nm\n\nm\n]\n\nacd+ acd? zd+ zd?\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 7.40: Average drum acceleration and displacements versus number of\npasses for three type of sections: (a) ISAC; (b) ISAC+SP; (c) CA40+SP\n\nthan the correspondent value obtained on CA40+SP profile (ESPLT = 119 MPa).\nThis relation (50%) is quite similar to the one verified between average acd?p\nand zd?p , about 46% and 50%, respectively. As so, one may conclude that peak\ndrum accelerations decreased with increasing stiffness.\n\nIn the same manner, also moduli obtained from FWD carried out were in-\nvestigated. FWD results on ISAC section are higher than the corresponding\nvalues obtained on the other sections. Indeed, average EFWD in ISAC profile\nregarding to 1st, 2nd and 3rd drop heights is, respectively, 73, 82 and 100%\ngreater than the corresponding values obtained from ISAC+SP profile, and 54,\n64 and 78% greater than the corresponding values obtained from CA40+SP\nprofile. However, comparison between average acd?p measured on ISAC+SP\nand CA40+SP profiles and FWD moduli did not showed the same trend. Av-\nerage acd?p , corresponding to 10 passes, measured in CA40+SP profile was 19%\ngreater than the average peak acceleration measured in ISAC+SP profile, yet\nEFWD obtained from tests performed on CA40+SP profile were 10\u201313% greater\nthan the EFWD obtained on ISAC+SP profile, which is not consistent with the\nprevious findings.\n\nHowever, FWD moduli obtained from test campaigns carried out on these\nprofiles after placing betuminous layers revealed consistently identical or greater\nstiffness of ISAC+SP profile than in CA40+SP profile (Reis Ferreira, 2010). It\n\n\n\n218 Field investigation: FTRE\n\nis worth noting that the same type of betuminous material was placed over base\nlayer. To this end, these profiles only differs on base layer material. Therefore,\nit is believed that differences on FWD results are influenced mainly by base\nlayer and, consequently, reflects the greater stiffness of the ISAC base layer.\nThese last results are consistent with accelerations measurements.\n\nIn order to this phenomena acceleration measurements were investigated.\nThough CV for ISAC+SP (14.1%) was much greater than the corresponding\nvalue obtained for CA40+SP (5.7%), it does not seems sufficient to explain\nthe contradicting trends found. On the other hand, stress dependency of ISAC\nmaterial stiffness may explain it. Material stiffness increases with increasing\nconfining stress and decreases with increasing shear stress. Within an impact\nloading, the shear stress increases and the confining stress increases too due\nto lateral confinement. Stresses induced by roller drum may be substantially\ngreater than the stress applied by FWD. To this end, the increase of stiffness\ndue to an increase of confining stress seems to come over the decrease in stiffness\ndue to an increase of shear stress. Thus, vibration history of the drum reflects\nhigher stiffness of ISAC+SP profile. Regarding FWD results obtained from\ntests carried out on betuminous layers, it seems that the effect of confining\nstress induced by betuminous layers leads to an increasing stiffness of ISAC\nmaterial in base layer.\n\nThe previous results demonstrated that vibration characteristics exhibited\nsensitivity to changes in underlying material properties due to compaction pro-\ncess. Drum peak vertical acceleration and displacement decreased as underlying\nmaterial stiffens. This type of drum behaviour was observed by Scullion et al.\n(2006) and Mooney and Rinehart (2007) when drum is operating at excita-\ntion frequencies lower than the natural frequency of drum\u2013soil system. The\nfrequency content illustrated in Figure 7.38 indicated that roller drum was op-\nerating at frequency about 19 Hz. Therefore, the natural frequency of drum\u2013soil\nsystem is believed to be higher.\n\nFocusing on acceleration measurements, the acceleration levels measured at\nany time during compaction reflect machine vibration upon a complex body of\ninvolved soil that is stressed by the vibrating drum at a given time and location.\nThe involved soil ahead of the drum is less dense than the involved soil behind\nthe drum. Hence, the drum vibration characteristics during any pass reflect\nmachine vibration on soil that varies from loose state ahead of the roller to\ncompacted state behind the drum. Either from Figure 7.38 and Table D.17\none can see that peak positive drum acceleration significantly exceeds peak\nnegative drum acceleration at all profiles and during all passes of the roller.\nThe overage ranged between 12\u201328% for ISAC profile, 0\u201316% for ISAC+SP\nprofile and 4\u20137% for CA40+SP profile. Also note that differences tend to be\nhigher with increasing number of passes, although a clear trend could not be\nobserved. Difference between positive and negative drum acceleration seems to\nbe dependent on the changes of underlying materials. Mooney et al. (2005)\nfound that acceleration amplitudes were close to symmetric in vertical direction\nduring stationary vibration on a fairly linear elastic underlying medium, whereas\ndrum acceleration amplitudes on non linear underlying medium were up to\n18% greater in the negative vertical acceleration than the positive one. This\ndifference is also a measure of system nonlinearity due to numerous aspects,\ne.g., inelastic soil behaviour, machine nonlinearity, curved drum acting on the\nsoil surface and possible drum decoupling from the soil (Adam, 1996; Anderegg\n\n\n\nField monitoring of roller drum and capping layer vibrations 219\n\nand Kaufmann, 2004; Mooney et al., 2005; van Susante and Mooney, 2008).\n\nThe harmonic content on frequency history also confirmed the non linear\nbehaviour of soil\u2013drum system. Mooney et al. (2005) investigated harmonic\ncontent as a measure of system nonlinearity. The harmonic components normal-\nized by the fundamental component Hfi/Hf1 and the total harmonic distortion\n(THD), both as percentages, were determined for tests carried out with instru-\nmented roller over four materials with different stiffnesses, as mentioned earlier.\nThe THD provided a measure of collective harmonic content and is expressed\nas follows:\n\nTHD =\n\n?\n\nH2f2 + H\n2\nf3 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + H\n\n2\nfN\n\nHf1\n\u00d7 100 (7.9)\n\nThe authors verified that the normalized frequency components and the THD\nwere small (less than 1%) during vibration on rubber tires, which was supposed\nto be a fairly linear elastic underlying medium; the majority of the distortion\nwas manifested in the first harmonic for all test beds. Moreover, normalized\nfrequency components and THD increased with underlying material stiffness\nand was found to exhibit much greater sensivity to changes in underlying ma-\nterial stiffness than drum acceleration amplitude. A similar investigation was\nconducted with regards to three profiles and results are presented on Table 7.27.\n\nThe THD essentially reflects he ratio Hf2/Hf1, since values of Hf3 and Hf4\nwere much smaller than Hf2. THD varied from 41 to 74% during compaction on\nISAC, 23 to 30% on ISAC+SP and 33 to 46% on CA40+SP profiles. The high\nvalues of THD reflects high non linear behaviour of soil\u2013drum system. Com-\npaction over ISAC profile exhibited greater nonlinearity which is consistent with\nthe ratio between average peak positive and negative drum acceleration given\nin Table D.17. However, it seems that there is no linear relation between these\ntwo parameters within the number of passes of the vibrating roller. Regarding\nISAC+SP, THD values are the lowest, while average peak positive and negative\ndrum acceleration ranges from 0 up to 16%. This interval includes the ratio for\nCA40+SP profile (4\u20137%). This probably due to the greater scatter on acceler-\nation data measured during compaction of ISAC+SP profile that is reflected in\na higher CV.\n\nIt is worth noting that magnitude of THD measured during vibration on\nISAC was about 55% greater than magnitude of THD measured during vibration\non CA40+SP, whereas it ranged between 26 to 225% in relation to ISAC+SP\nprofile. Taking into account previous conclusions, it seems that THD was sen-\nsible to changes in underlying material and increased with increased stiffness.\nThe THD relation between ISAC and CA40+SP profiles of 55% is consistent\nwith the relation between modulus given by SPLT performed on both profiles.\nHowever, a close look to THD variation within the number of passes in each\nprofile did not showed a clear trend. When comparison between passes 2 and\n10 is established, one can see that THD decreased for ISAC and CA40+SP\nprofiles, while the opposite was observed for ISAC+SP profile. This trend was\nagainst the established relation between THD and stiffness. Therefore, it seems\nthat THD is not sufficient feature to be used as indicator of varying stifness.\n\n\n\n220 Field investigation: FTRE\n\nTable 7.27: Frequency domain results for vibration on the three profiles\n\nSection No. of Passes\n2 4 6 8 10\n\nISAC Freq [Hz] 18.6 18.9 18.7 18.9 18.6\nH1 [m.s\n\n?2/Hz] 33 34 46 30 32\nH2 [m.s\n\n?2/Hz] 23 24 18 22 16\nH3 [m.s\n\n?2/Hz] 6 6 5 5 5\nH4 [m.s\n\n?2/Hz] 1 2 2 1 2\nH2/H1 [%] 70 70 39 72 49\nH3/H1 [%] 17 17 11 16 14\nH4/H1 [%] 4 5 4 5 5\nTHD [%] 72 72 41 74 51\n\nISAC + Freq [Hz] 18.4 18.7 18.4 18.6 18.4\nSP H1 [m.s\n\n?2/Hz] 53 57 60 55 42\nH2 [m.s\n\n?2/Hz] 15 15 19 12 12\nH3 [m.s\n\n?2/Hz] 3 3 5 3 4\nH4 [m.s\n\n?2/Hz] 1 1 1 1 1\nH2/H1 [%] 28 27 32 22 28\nH3/H1 [%] 6 6 8 6 8\nH4/H1 [%] 2 1 2 1 2\nTHD [%] 29 27 32 23 30\n\nCA40 + Freq [Hz] 18.1 18.3\nSP H1 [m.s\n\n?2/Hz] 47 52\nH2 [m.s\n\n?2/Hz] 21 17\nH3 [m.s\n\n?2/Hz] 4 4\nH4 [m.s\n\n?2/Hz] 1 1\nH2/H1 [%] 45 33\nH3/H1 [%] 9 7\nH4/H1 [%] 2 2\nTHD [%] 46 33\n\n\n\nField monitoring of roller drum and capping layer vibrations 221\n\nIn\u2013ground acceleration measurements\n\nIn\u2013ground acceleration measurements were carried out during roller drum\noperation over all profiles. Data was gathered during 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 passes\nof the vibrating roller on base layer. Similarly to previous analysis, time do-\nmain features were determined from the vibration histories. Then, data gleaned\nfrom in\u2013ground accelerometers was computed in order to obtain displacements.\nIt should be highlighted that vibrations measurements reflects only the cyclic\nresponse induced by the roller drum.\n\nVibration data from accelerometers was referenced to each in\u2013ground sen-\nsors, which means that abscissa x reflects the position of the drum relative to\nthe in\u2013ground sensor location. Negative x indicate that the drum is approaching\nthe sensors while positive x indicate that drum is moving away from the sensors.\nThe x = 0 position means that the roller drum was in the vertical alignment of\nthe sensor. It should be noted that the roller is traveling left to right, except for\npass 1 in which roller traveled in the opposite way. Peak amplitudes time his-\ntory of in\u2013ground accelerations measured on ISAC and CA40+SP profiles are\nplotted in Figure 7.41 ever results were available. Peak positive and negative\nvalues due to vibration above accelerometers are plotted in Figure 7.42 along\nwith computed displacements.\n\nA noticeable decrease of in\u2013ground peak accelerations and displacements\nbetween 1 and 10 passes of vibrating roller is observed in both profiles (fig. 7.42).\nPeak accelerations (ac+p and ac\n\n?\n\np ) decreased 21 and 42%, respectively, in ISAC\nprofile, whereas in CA40+SP profile a corresponding reduction of 32 and 47% is\nverified. Regarding peak displacements (z+p and z\n\n?\n\np ) in ISAC profile, a decrease\nof 37% is obtained from both positive and negative displacements, whereas in\nCA40+SP profile a reduction of 27 and 32% is verified, respectively. Accordingly\nto previous conclusions from drum behaviour, stiffness increases with increasing\nnumber of passes of the vibrating roller. To this end, one may conclude that\nboth in\u2013ground accelerations and displacements at 0.65 m depth decreases as\nbase layer stiffens. In fact, both parameters obtained from CA40+SP were\nmore than twice the corresponding value for ISAC profile (fig. 7.42), which\ndenotes greater stiffness from ISAC profile. These results are consistent with\nthe ones obtained on previous sections.\n\nIt is noteworthy that a greater decrease of in\u2013ground accelerations and dis-\nplacements is observed between passes 1 and 2 for both profiles, which denotes\na great improvement in profile mechanical properties between passes 1 and 2.\nConcerning ISAC profile, beyond pass 2 an increase of both parameters is ob-\nserved during pass 4, while from pass 6 to 10 an unclear trend is observed.\nNevertheless, between passes 2 and 10 peak positive in\u2013ground accelerations\nand displacements fairly increased, whereas, negative in\u2013ground accelerations\nand displacements remained almost the same. Owing to CA40+SP one can\nobserve that all parameters decreased between pass 2 and 10.\n\nFocusing on acceleration measurements, it is interesting noting that average\nac?p exceeded average ac\n\n+\np in ISAC profile, except to pass 10. The ratio be-\n\ntween these parameters was about 23% for pass 1 and decreased to -10% for\npass 10, which means that acd+p exceeded acd\n\n?\n\np . From vibration measurements\nduring roller stationary vibrating loading presented earlier, one can see that for\nthe same level of drum vibration (ac+p about 20 m.s\n\n?2; ac?p about 15 m.s\n?2)\n\npeak positive exceeding peak negative acceleration features in\u2013ground vibra-\n\n\n\n222 Field investigation: FTRE\n\n?1 ?0.5 0 0.5 1\n?10\n\n?5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nx [m]\n\nA\ncc\n\ne\nle\n\nra\ntio\n\nn\n [\n\nm\n.s\n\n?\n2\n]\n\nAc bot\n\nV08\n\nV04\n\nV09\n\nRoller\ndrum\n\nBase layer\n\n(a)\n\n?1 ?0.5 0 0.5 1\n?20\n\n?10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\nA\ncc\n\ne\nle\n\nra\ntio\n\nn\n [\n\nm\n.s\n\n?\n2\n]\n\nx [m]\n\nAc bot\n\nV01\n\nV05\n\nV02\n\nRoller\ndrum\n\nBase layer\n\n(b)\n\n?1 ?0.5 0 0.5 1\n?0.3\n\n?0.2\n\n?0.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nD\nis\n\np\nla\n\nce\nm\n\ne\nn\n\nt \n[m\n\nm\n]\n\nx [m]\n\nAc bot\n\nV08\n\nV04\n\nV09\n\nRoller\ndrum\n\nBase layer\n\n(c)\n\n?1 ?0.5 0 0.5 1\n?0.8\n\n?0.6\n\n?0.4\n\n?0.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nD\nis\n\np\nla\n\nce\nm\n\ne\nn\n\nt \n[m\n\nm\n]\n\nx [m]\n\nAc bot\n\nV01\n\nV05\n\nV02\n\nRoller\ndrum\n\nBase layer\n\n(d)\n\n1 pass 2 pass 4 pass 6 pass 8 pass 10 pass\n\nFigure 7.41: Acceleration time history and computed displacements obtained\nfrom in\u2013ground vibrations measured on: (a) and (c) ISAC profile; (b) and (d)\nCA40+SP profile\n\ntion at z = 0.22 m, while the opposite was observed for in\u2013ground vibration\nat z = 0.45 m, where stress level is lower. Given these facts, it seems that\nfor lower stresses ac?p exceeds ac\n\n+\np , whereas for higher stresses the opposite\n\nis verified. Hence, by applying this finding to the results of in\u2013ground vibra-\ntions during ISAC base layer compaction, one may conclude that stress level at\nz = 0.65 m increased with increasing number of passes of the vibration roller\nand, consequently, with increasing ISAC profile stiffness. This may be explained\nby drum\u2013material contact width during successive passes of vibrating roller. As\nprofile stiffens the contact width narrows and, therefore, applied stress increases\nleading to an increase stress in depth.\n\nFrom in\u2013ground accelerations measured on CA40+SP profile a different\ntrend was verified. ac+p exceeded ac\n\n?\n\np for passes 1, 2 and 10 with corresponding\nratios of 15, 38 and 34%, respectively.

Thus, by applying this finding to the results of\nin\u2013ground vibrations during CA40 base layer compaction, one may conclude\nthat stress level at z = 0.65 m increased within passes 1 and 2 and slightly\ndecreased between passes 2 and 10. Recalling previous section, drum roller re-\nsponse indicated that stiffness increased between passes 2 and 10. Given these\nopposite trends, it seems that stiffness increase of profile was due mainly to\nCA40 base layer.\n\nAnother interesting feature is that maximum ac?p occurred when roller was\nabout 0.50 m away from sensor regarding pass 1. This distance decreased to\napproximately half distance to pass 2 and remained constant for the other passes,\nwhich seems to be relate to increasing stiffness of the profile. Note that due to\nthe roller being traveling in opposite direction during pass 1, the evolution of\nin\u2013ground vibration is fairly symmetric to the other lines. In the same way,\nnegative displacements are highest when drum roller was about 0.30 m away\nfrom the sensor and slightly decreased when the roller drum moved towards\nthe sensor. A fairly symmetric behaviour was observed when the roller drum\nmoved away from the sensor (fig. 7.41d). Regarding ISAC profile, although\nmaximum peak negative displacements were observed when the roller drum was\nabove sensor during pass 1, for the other passes peak negative displacement was\nobserved when the roller drum was approximately 0.25 m away from the sensor\nand when the roller drum was moving away from the sensor. The phenomena\nwas also observed from strain data and will be discussed later.\n\nIn\u2013ground strain measurements\n\nStrain measurements carried out during 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 passes of the\nvibrating roller on base layer are presented in Figures 7.43, 7.44 and 7.45, corre-\nsponding to ISAC, ISAC+SP and CA40+SP profiles. It is important to bear in\nmind that strain response reflects the response due to both static weight of the\ndrum and cyclic forces generated by the vibrating drum. Further, it should be\nnoted that the effects of of overburden and previous passes have been removed\nso strains are due to the roller drum only, which means all passes start with\nzero strain. Likewise to acceleration data, strain data was referenced to each\n\n\n\n224 Field investigation: FTRE\n\nin\u2013ground sensors, which means that abscissa x reflects the position of the drum\nrelative to the in\u2013ground sensor location.\n\nIn Table D.19 is given total strain (?z) and cyclic portion (??z) due to\nvibrating roller passes on base layer, as well as the ratio ??z/?z. Note that\nfor strain gauge V08, placed in ISAC section, only data from passes 2 and 4\nare presented, since sensor become inoperative beyond this point. Regarding\nstrains measurements on CA40+SP profile (strain gauges V01, V02 and V05)\nonly data from passes 1, 2 and 10 are available. This was due to problems in\nthe acquisition system during remaining passes.\n\nIn\u2013ground peak strains and ratio ??z/?z at roller drum position x = 0 were\nevaluated with number of passes and are plotted in Figures 7.46, 7.47 and 7.48.\nData analysis shows that evolution of peak total strain and ratio ??z/?z is\ninverse.\n\nA clear trend is observed from strain data obtained in ISAC section, where\npeak total strain increases with increasing number of passes, which means with\nincreasing stiffness of the material being compacted (fig. 7.46a). As mentioned\nearlier, this behaviour may be attributed to the narrow contact width of the\ndrum\u2013material. Though sensors V08 and V09 were at same depth, measured ?z\nmaximum values ranged from 2500 to 4500 \u00d7 10?6 and from 1 to 2200 \u00d7 10?6,\nrespectively. As so, ?z given by strain gauge V08 was about twice the ?z given\nby strain gauge V09 (see figs. 7.43a and 7.43b). This may be due to improper\ninstallation of the sensor V08, for example, disturbance of material around the\nsensor during placement which was left in a loose state. This notwithstanding,\nthe same trend is verified from both sensors V08 and V09. With regards to\nstrain gauge V04 at z = 0.65 m, ?z values ranged from 500 to 1100 \u00d7 10\n\n?6,\nwhich were approximately half than the ones obtained from strain gauge V09.\nRecall both sensors were placed in the same vertical alignment.\n\nConversely, ratio ratio ??z/?z was found to decrease within the number of\npasses, as illustrated in Figure 7.46b. Actually, ??z for strain gauges V04 and\nV09 decreased 43 and 45%, respectively, between passes 1 and 10, yet great\nreduction was observed between pass 1 and 2. Since this parameter reflects only\nthe cyclic portion of strain measurements, comparison with in depth accelera-\ntion measurements shows that this trend is consistent with the one found from\naccelerometers data at the same depth (fig. 7.42a). Note that the ratio ranged\nover 6\u201318%. The small magnitude of ??z compared to ?z was also found by\nRinehart and Mooney (2009) and result from curved drum\u2013material interaction\nand material viscoelasticity. During vibration, the applied force equals the static\nforce \u00b1 a cyclic force depending on eccentric static moment of the roller drum.\nContact stress and contact width are nonlinearly related to force and vertical\ndrum deflection, and leads to a hardening type relationship between applied\nforce and drum deflection (see Figure 2.14 in Chapter 2). The deflections (and\nin turn strains) due to drum vibration are relatively small compared to deflec-\ntions resulting from static loading. Further, one can see from Table D.19 that\n??z from V09 and V08 were similar, varying around 120 \u00d7 10\n\n?6, which cor-\nresponds to an order of magnitude less than ?z. ??z from V04 varied around\n80 \u00d7 10?6, corresponding to less than half the value obtained from sensors V08\nand V09.\n\nThe strains plot from strain gauge V06 (fig. 7.44) placed at 0.32 m depth in\nISAC+SP section illustrate differences from the previous section. From pass 1\nto 2 ?z decreased, increased between passes 2 and 6 and decreased again till last\n\n\n\nField monitoring of roller drum and capping layer vibrations 225\n\n?1 ?0.5 0 0.5 1\n?4400\n\n?3300\n\n?2200\n\n?1100\n\n0\n\n500\n\nx [m]\n\nS\ntr\n\na\nin\n\n [\n\u00d71\n\n0\n?\n\n6\n]\n\nAc bot\n\nV08\n\nV04\n\nV09\n\nRoller\ndrum\n\nBase layer\n\n(a)\n\n?1 ?0.5 0 0.5 1\n?180\n\n?120\n\n?60\n\n0\n\n60\n\n120\n\n180\n\nx [m]\nS\n\ntr\na\n\nin\n [\n\n\u00d71\n0\n\n?\n6\n]\n\nAc bot\n\nV08\n\nV04\n\nV09\n\nRoller\ndrum\n\nBase layer\n\n(b)\n\n?1 ?0.5 0 0.5 1\n?2400\n\n?1800\n\n?1200\n\n?600\n\n0\n\n300\n\nx [m]\n\nS\ntr\n\na\nin\n\n [\n\u00d71\n\n0\n?\n\n6\n]\n\nAc bot\n\nV08\n\nV04\n\nV09\n\nRoller\ndrum\n\nBase layer\n\n(c)\n\n?1 ?0.5 0 0.5 1\n?120\n\n?80\n\n?40\n\n0\n\n40\n\n80\n\n120\n\nx [m]\n\nS\ntr\n\na\nin\n\n [\n\u00d71\n\n0\n?\n\n6\n]\n\nAc bot\n\nV08\n\nV04\n\nV09\n\nRoller\ndrum\n\nBase layer\n\n(d)\n\n?1 ?0.5 0 0.5 1\n?1200\n\n?900\n\n?600\n\n?300\n\n0\n\n300\n\nx [m]\n\nS\ntr\n\na\nin\n\n [\n\u00d71\n\n0\n?\n\n6\n]\n\nAc bot\n\nV08\n\nV04\n\nV09\n\nRoller\ndrum\n\nBase layer\n\n(e)\n\n?1 ?0.5 0 0.5 1\n?45\n\n?30\n\n?15\n\n0\n\n15\n\n30\n\n45\n\nx [m]\n\nS\ntr\n\na\nin\n\n [\n\u00d71\n\n0\n?\n\n6\n]\n\nAc bot\n\nV08\n\nV04\n\nV09\n\nRoller\ndrum\n\nBase layer\n\n(f)\n\n1 pass 2 pass 4 pass 6 pass 8 pass 10 pass\n\nFigure 7.43: Total and cyclic strain data from strain gauge: (a) and (b) V08;\n(c) and (d) V09; (e) and (f) V04\n\npass (fig. 7.47a).

On the contrary, the ratio ??z/?z\nincreased approximately 32% (fig. 7.47b). Note that this trend is contrary to\nthe one verified in ISAC profile.\n\nWith regards to CA40+SP section, a different trend from previous sections\nis found. Strain data obtained from sensors placed at z = 0.32 m, V01 and V02,\nevolves in different ways, as one can see in Figure 7.48a. As so, the outcome is\ninconclusive. In contrast, a clear trend is verified from total strain concerning\nto strain gauge V05 placed at depth z = 0.65 m (fig. 7.48a). Total strain\ndecreased with increasing number of passes. As aforementioned, this finding is\nconsistent with the stress reducing effect of an overlying stiff layer (Burmister,\n1958). Similarly to reported on analysis of data from ISAC section, strains\ngiven by sensors V01 and V02, placed at same depth, are quite different too.\n?z measured ranged from 300 to 400 \u00d7 10\n\n?6 for the former and from 800 to\n1300 \u00d7 10?6 for the latter. Regarding strain sensor V05, one can see that ?z\nranged from 500 to 700\u00d710?6, which strains are about half the ones from strain\ngauge V09 placed in the same vertical alignment.\n\nOwing to the cyclic portion, once again one can see from Figure 7.48b that\nonly strain gauge V05 presents a clear trend, where ??z increases with increas-\ning number of passes. However, this trend is contrary to the one observed from\nacceleration data (fig. 7.42b). ??z from V01 and V02 is an order of magnitude\nless than ?z. ??z from V01 ranged from 40 to 70 \u00d7 10\n\n?6 and 130 to 170 \u00d7 10?6\n\nfrom V02. Although sensors were placed at the same depth a significant differ-\nence on ??z from V01 and V02 is noticeable. Concerning to V05, ??z varied\nabout 40 \u00d7 10?6. The ratio ??z/?z ranges over 11\u201317%, which are consistent\nwith values obtained for the other profiles.\n\nFocusing on total strain history it is noteworthy that the widening with\ndepth of the zone of material influenced by the roller, which is on the order of\n0.50\u20130.60m, 0.35\u20130.45m and 0.40\u20130.50m at z = 0.32 m corresponding to ISAC,\nISAC+SP and CA40+SP section, respectively, and widens to about 1.40\u20131.60m\nand 1.00\u20131.10m at z = 0.65 m, concerning to ISAC and CA40+SP sections.\n\n\n\nField monitoring of roller drum and capping layer vibrations 227\n\n?1 ?0.5 0 0.5 1\n?500\n\n?400\n\n?300\n\n?200\n\n?100\n\n0\n\n50\n\nx [m]\n\nS\ntr\n\na\nin\n\n [\n\u00d71\n\n0\n?\n\n6\n]\n\nAc bot\n\nV01\n\nV05\n\nV02\n\nRoller\ndrum\n\nBase layer\n\n(a)\n\n?1 ?0.5 0 0.5 1\n?45\n\n?30\n\n?15\n\n0\n\n15\n\n30\n\n45\n\nx [m]\nS\n\ntr\na\n\nin\n [\n\n\u00d71\n0\n\n?\n6\n]\n\nAc bot\n\nV01\n\nV05\n\nV02\n\nRoller\ndrum\n\nBase layer\n\n(b)\n\n?1 ?0.5 0 0.5 1\n?1600\n\n?1200\n\n?800\n\n?400\n\n0\n\n200\n\nx [m]\n\nS\ntr\n\na\nin\n\n [\n\u00d71\n\n0\n?\n\n6\n]\n\nAc bot\n\nV01\n\nV05\n\nV02\n\nRoller\ndrum\n\nBase layer\n\n(c)\n\n?1 ?0.5 0 0.5 1\n?90\n\n?60\n\n?30\n\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\nx [m]\n\nS\ntr\n\na\nin\n\n [\n\u00d71\n\n0\n?\n\n6\n]\n\nAc bot\n\nV01\n\nV05\n\nV02\n\nRoller\ndrum\n\nBase layer\n\n(d)\n\n?1 ?0.5 0 0.5 1\n?800\n\n?600\n\n?400\n\n?200\n\n0\n\n100\n\nx [m]\n\nS\ntr\n\na\nin\n\n [\n\u00d71\n\n0\n?\n\n6\n]\n\nAc bot\n\nV01\n\nV05\n\nV02\n\nRoller\ndrum\n\nBase layer\n\n(e)\n\n?1 ?0.5 0 0.5 1\n?45\n\n?30\n\n?15\n\n0\n\n15\n\n30\n\n45\n\nx [m]\n\nS\ntr\n\na\nin\n\n [\n\u00d71\n\n0\n?\n\n6\n]\n\nAc bot\n\nV01\n\nV05\n\nV02\n\nRoller\ndrum\n\nBase layer\n\n(f)\n\n1 pass 2 pass 10 pass\n\nFigure 7.45: Total and cyclic strain data from strain gauge: (a) and (b) V01;\n(c) and (d) V02; (e) and (f) V05\n\nThis results shows that a given roller\u2013measured stiffness value is representative\nof soil about 0.25\u20130.30m in the front of and behind the center of the drum\nnear surface.

Therefore, area of influence assumes great importance when\nperforming correlations of roller\u2013measured stiffness to spot tests results as is\ncommonly performed in CCC (Mooney and Rinehart, 2009). Further, in order\nto investigate depth of influence from both roller drum and SPLT, SPLT was\nperformed over strain sensors V09 and V04 at ISAC section and over strain\nsensors V02 and V05 at CA40+SP section after 10 passes of the roller drum.

Though\nstrains at z = 0.32 m induced by roller drum and SPLT differs significantly, at\ngreater depth (z = 0.65 m) strain levels are quite similar.\n\nIn what concerns to SPLT carried out on CA40+SP section (fig. 7.49b), a\nhardening response was observed from strain gauge V02 at depth z = 0.32 m,\nwhile at depth z = 0.65 m strain gauge V05 exhibited softening response dur-\ning second loading cycle. This notwithstanding, response may be considered as\nfairly linear. In second load cycle relative strains of 1112\u00d710?6 and 568\u00d710?6\n\nwere measured, respectively, which seems to match total strains induced by\nroller drum during pass 10, 1320\u00d710?6 and 483\u00d710?6. This findings demon-\nstrated close strain responses between load applied by the roller and SPLT, thus,\nare of great importance for the establishment of correlations with roller drum\nbehaviour. It is noteworthy that strain at the bottom of the capping layer is\ntwo times less than at the top of the same layer. This difference is consistent\n\n\n\n230 Field investigation: FTRE\n\nwith the stress reducing effect of an overlying stiff layer (Burmister, 1958).\n\nFurther, one can see that material immediately in front of the drum experi-\nences vertical extension during pass 1, which is due to the traveling nature of\nthe roller (Adam, 1996).\n\nFinally, it is interesting noting the development of both ?z and ??z from\nsensor V05. These values increased as the roller drum approached, peaks at\napproximately at x = 0.05 to 0.15 m, and slightly decreased to a local minimum\nwhen the roller was just above the sensor at x = 0. As the roller moved away,\n?z and ??z increased, peaks at approximately at x = 0.05 to 0.15 m and de-\ncreased beyond this point. Beneath the drum (x = 0) shear stress and strain\nare theoretically zero or very small compared with normal stresses and strains\n(Johnson, 1987; Hirikawa et al., 2000). Hence, peak strains are due to normal\nand shear stresses induced by the roller, which effect is greater approximately\nat x = \u00b10.05 to 0.15 m away from vertical alignment of the sensor. The same\nbehaviour was found from acceleration data and is identical to the one observed\nduring Portanceme?tre pass on capping layer of SP profile at depth z = 0.45 m.\n\n7.9 Conclusions\n\nIn this chapter, results obtained from several in situ tests performed on\ntrial, embankment and base layers were presented. Three types of materials\nwere studied, namely, poor\u2013graded sand with silt (SP) employed in trial and\nembankment layers, inert steel aggregate for construction (ISAC) employed in\ntrial, embankment and base layers and a well\u2013graded gravel (CA40) employed\nin base layers.\n\nFirstly, state conditions obtained from sand cone method (SCM), rubber bal-\nloon method (RBM) and nuclear method (NM) were presented. NM was found\nto be inappropriate to determine state conditions of ISAC layers. Moisture\ncontent of SP trial layers ranged over 3\u20134% dry of optimum, whereas embank-\nment layers varied between 1 and 3% dry of optimum. The wetting process\nemployed on SP material which involved the previous stack of material, water\nadding and mix up by means of a front shovel and, in addition, moisture content\nwas corrected in situ before compaction process, did not reproduced desirable\nmoisture conditions. Moreover, density slightly decreased with increasing mois-\nture content. The highest moisture content coefficient of variation (CV) was\nobtained from trial layer with 0.50 m thickness, which denotes the influence of\nlayer thickness on moisture content homogeneity. Nevertheless, dry density CV\nwas less than 3% for all layers, which lie below limit given by Brandl (1977).\n\nSecondly, correlations between moduli obtained from light falling weight de-\nflectometer (LFWD), soil stiffness gauge (SSG), falling weight deflectometer\n(FWD), spectral analysis of surface waves (SASW) and Portanceme?tre using\nstatic plate loading test (SPLT) as reference test were attempted. Concerning\nto SP material, though the data is limited, a general relationship between SPLT\n(EV2) and Portanceme?tre (EPort) moduli close to unity was found. This means\nthat results given by these tests are approximately the same validating the cal-\nibration method used and indicate the huge potential of this equipment for the\ncontinuous stiffness evaluation on earthwork platforms. Recall conclusion from\nSC material on ETRE was similar. The SPLT results were then compared with\nLFWD results, but a difference of approximately 55% was found. Since corre-\n\n\n\nConclusions 231\n\nlation between Portanceme?tre and SPLT is close to unity, the former was used\nas reference test to confirm this difference. Comparison between Portanceme?tre\nwith LFWD was then found to be around 40%. This conclusion differs from\nthe obtained in previous chapter to SC material. Thus, more results would be\nrequired in order to study the application of LFWD to this type of material.\nThe relation of Portanceme?tre to the SSG (ESSG) moduli yielded data with large\nscatter, although the moduli obtained with both equipments was approximately\nthe same. Likewise conclusions in previous chapter, the results from LFWD and\nSSG equipment should be treated with caution.\n\nWith regards to ISAC material different conclusions were obtained regarding\nto the ones described in previous paragraph. Moduli given by SPLT (EV2) and\nPortanceme?tre (EPort) differ approximately 45%. Correlation between LFWD\nand Portanceme?tre moduli was close to unity (only differs 12%), while between\nSSG and Portanceme?tre moduli differs 30%. This shows the necessity of equip-\nments calibration for each kind of material. Though it seems possible to estab-\nlish correlations between moduli of in situ performance\u2013based tests methods,\nmaterial type and state conditions should be taken into account on this eval-\nuation. Concerning to CA40+SP profile due to lack of results no sustainable\nconclusions were obtained.\n\nSASW were carried out using different sources types, namely light hammer,\nsledge hammer and LFWD and FWD equipments. Sledge hammer source was\nfound not appropriated to the setup employed. On the contrary, good results\nwere obtained using light hammer source, as well as results obtained using\nLFWD and FWD as sources demonstrated that these equipments can be used\nfor seismic surface analysis. This findings assume great importance, specially in\nthe case of FWD since equipment has already mounted a deflection measuring\nsystem consisting of 8 geophones positioned along 3 meters from the center\nof the source (loading plate). Besides traditional back\u2013analysis or even static\nloading approach for the interpretation of FWD test, data gathered from these\nsensors can be used to perform surface seismic analysis. This interpretation\nwould allow, on one hand, to confirm traditional back\u2013analysis regarding the\nnumber of layers and, on the other hand, the extraction of low strain modulus.\n\nThen, analysis of moduli and state conditions was conducted. Moisture con-\ntent was found have unnoticeable influence on moduli for the range of moisture\ncontent studied, 1 to 4% dry of optimum. Conversely, dry density seems to\ninfluence mechanical properties. Moduli increased with increasing dry density,\nas long as moisture content do not vary significantly.\n\nComparison between full scale trial and laboratory results yielded differences\nlower than 27%, laboratory moduli being higher than field moduli. This results\nassumes great importance taking into account that design is based on mechanical\nproperties usually determined from laboratory tests.\n\nFurther, an experimental program was carried out to monitor drum roller\nand layer vibrations in two phases. Phase One aimed vibrations measurement\nof the capping layer during tests, namely, LFWD, FWD, Portanceme?tre and\nroller drum. Accelerometers and strain gauges were buried on the capping layer\nenabling measurement of dynamic response and total strains. ISAC and SP\nmaterials were tested in this phase.\n\nStrain measurements from SP and ISAC profiles during aforementioned tests\nindicate different depths of influence, which can be ordered in increasing way:\nLFWD, FWD, Portanceme?tre and roller drum. However, strain measurements\n\n\n\n232 Field investigation: FTRE\n\ndid not always reflected moduli obtained from performance related tests. In fact,\nhigher strains were obtained from in\u2013ground measurements in ISAC profile that\nwas found to had higher stiffness. These results were unexpected and theoretical\napproach regarding LFWD and FWD tests was unable to explain these results.\nOn the contrary, in\u2013ground displacements obtained from acceleration measure-\nments were consistent with profiles stiffness. Higher in\u2013ground displacements\nwere found regarding SP profile than in ISAC profile, which is consistent with\nlower modulus obtained in the former than the latter. Hence, in\u2013ground dy-\nnamic response reflect moduli obtained from dynamic tests performed at layer\nsurface.\n\nOwing to impact loads from LFWD and FWD on SP profile, in\u2013ground\nstrains and displacements were consistent with theoretical approach considering\na single modulus, yet modulus obtained from both tests differed. These results\nhighlight the importance of test methods calibration using a reference test and\nallowed to conclude higher depth of influence from plate with higher diame-\nter. Results obtained from ISAC profile did not confirmed these conclusions,\nwhich might be attributed to stationary drum tests between impact tests which\ninduced significant differences on profile mechanical homogeneity.\n\nConcerning to vibration loads induced by Portanceme?tre and roller drum on\nSP profile, displacements at lower depth differed about 25%, whereas at higher\ndepth differed only 12%. The analysis of acceleration data denote non linear\nbehaviour at lower depth, while behaviour close to linear appears to prevail at\nhigher depth. As so, a similar dynamic in\u2013ground response is found at higher\ndepth. Since roller drum and Portanceme?tre wheel dynamic behaviour reflects\ndynamic in\u2013ground response, this fact might indicate a good correlation between\nmechanical properties determined from instrumented rollers and Portanceme?tre.\n\nPhase Two involved vibrations measurement of roller drum and vibrations\nof capping layer during compaction of base layer. Three different profiles were\ntested, namely, one formed only by ISAC material, and the others formed\nby ISAC and CA40 materials resting on SP capping layer. Two accelerom-\neters were embarked on the drum and acceleration signals were then computed\nin order to obtain roller vertival movement during compaction. At the same\ntime, capping layer was instrumented with in\u2013ground accelerometers and strain\ngauges in order to get information of vibrations in depth. Vertical drum acceler-\nation and displacement were found to be sensitive to changes in underlying soil\nstiffness. Both decreased with increasing soil stiffness for an excitation frequency\nof about 19 Hz, which features drum vibration below the natural frequency of\ntest bed. Further, good correlation was found between drum vibration and\nSPLT modulus obtained from ISAC and CA40+SP profiles. In addition, at\n0.65 m depth strain levels induced by SPLT were similar to the ones induced\nby roller drum, denotes identical depth of influence. These findings shows that\nSPLT modulus reflect drum behaviour and, therefore, should be used as refer-\nence test.\n\nConcerning in\u2013ground vibrations measurements, similar trend to drum be-\nhaviour was found, i.e., accelerations and computed displacements decreased\nwithin number of passes on both profiles, thus with increasing stiffness. There-\nfore, in\u2013ground dynamic response measured by means of in\u2013ground accelerom-\neters denotes close relation to drum behaviour, as was concluded from Phase\nOne. On the other hand, results from in\u2013ground strains were inconclusive.\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nConclusions\n\n8.1 Conclusions\n\nSeveral aspects that governs high\u2013speed railway embankments, which dis-\ntinguishes from other conventional transportation infrastructure, like road em-\nbankments, were identified. High\u2013speed railway embankments demands an in-\nfrastructure exhibiting an overall stiffness that limits maximum settlements and\nminimize relative settlements of the embankment platform during serviceability\nconditions, in order to minimize the exploration costs, to avoid high level of\ndiscomfort for passengers and reduce induced vibrations on surrounding struc-\ntures.\n\nThese aspects include strict requirements demands of high quality construc-\ntion of embankment and railtrack layers regarding material quality, state pa-\nrameters and mechanical properties limits, promoting homogeneity of mechan-\nical behaviour of compacted layers. As mentioned in Chapter 2 requirements\nincrease from bottom to top layers. The embankment layers should provide\na stable foundation for the base (subballast) and ballast layers. The range of\nstiffness of the capping layers is believed to influence ballast, rail and sleeper de-\nterioration, since the influence of the traffic induced stresses extends downwards\nas much as 5 meters below the bottom of the sleepers. Hence, embankment lay-\ners are a very important substructure component which as a significant influence\non track performance and maintenance. Base layer (subballast) assumes great\nimportance due to several aspects, e.g. to ensure better distribution of loads, to\nprotect the underlying layer against erosion, to avoid seepage into the underly-\ning layer and to prevent the penetration of fine soil material into the track bed,\nespecially to the ballast.\n\nFurthermore, strict requirements on quality construction demands higher\nquality on materials compaction control. From the literature review, it was\nconcluded that there is a strong trend towards using performance based proper-\nties like stiffness and strength to assess layer compaction (Briaud, 2001; Loizos\net al., 2003; Alshibli et al., 2005; Edil and Sawangsurya, 2005). These proper-\nties are a measure of quality since non\u2013uniformity of stiffness and/or strength is\ndirectly related to progressive failures and life\u2013cycle cost. Moreover, the design\nmethod of layer systems is based on engineering parameters of materials such\nas their stiffness and/or strength, which results in a missing link between the\n\n233\n\n\n\n234 Conclusions\n\ndesign process and construction quality assessment.\nIncreasing demands for better, cheaper and faster compaction assessment\n\nhave lead to technology improvements. In this context, equipments for field test\nevaluation of mechanical properties of geomaterials have been recently devel-\noped, such as, impact tests (Falling Weight Deflectometer \u2013 FWD and Light\nFalling Weight Deflectometer \u2013 LFWD), the Soil Stiffness Gauge (SSG), Spec-\ntral Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW). These are non\u2013destructive spot tests\nwhich can be conducted independently and in conjunction with conventional\nmoisture density testing improving statistical evaluation and allowing variability\nreduction, thus substantially enhance construction quality of the entire earth-\nwork (Edil and Sawangsurya, 2005). Moreover, equipments enabling continuous\nevaluation of layer stiffness, like Portanceme?tre, had been developed which rep-\nresents a great improvement on platform quality. However, these equipments\nare not standardized and requires comparison to the reference test given on\nspecifications, usually static plate load test (SPLT) following either AFNOR\nNF P94\u2013117\u20131 (2000) or DIN 18134 (2001) before CEN standards will be avail-\nable.\n\nMoreover, railway embankments and railtrack layers are constructed on com-\npacted geomaterials that are typically in unsaturated condition during construc-\ntion and may remain in that condition during the working life of the struc-\nture. Several design and maintenance measures are undertaken to maintain\nunsaturated conditions because they provide favorable engineering materials\nproperties, namely strength and stiffness. The literature review showed that\ncompaction conditions (moisture content, compaction energy and compaction\ntechnique) strongly influence the hydro\u2013mechanical behaviour of unsaturated\ngeomaterials, namely, strength and stiffness, due to suction effect. However, the\nhydro\u2013mechanical behaviour of unsaturated geomaterials is not straightforward\ndue to the presence of suction and, even at critical states, the results found on\nliterature are contradictory. Therefore, a better understanding of the hydro\u2013\nmechanical behaviour of compacted layers requires both laboratory and field\ninvestigations.\n\nIn the scope of the present work laboratory and field evaluation of influ-\nence of compaction conditions on the hydro\u2013mechanical behaviour of different\ngeomaterials was carried out. In what follows the main achievements will be\npointed out.\n\n8.1.1 Laboratory investigation\n\nThroughout a laboratory investigation the influence of compaction condi-\ntions, namely, molding water content, on hydro\u2013mechanical behaviour of geo-\nmaterials was evaluated. Emphasis was given to mechanical characterization,\nparticularly regarding to clayey sand (SC) material, since it has a non negligi-\nble fine fraction. The same procedure was employed on all tests to study both\nmaterials. Specimens were compacted with the same initial void ratio but with\ndifferent molding water contents and tested in unsaturated condition. Further\nalso saturated and dry tests were carried out.\n\nThe hydro\u2013characterization of SC material was carried out by means of fil-\nter paper technique. Tests showed good repeatability and, thereby, filter paper\ntechnique proved to be an easy and low cost method to determine water re-\ntention curve. Molding water content was found to strongly influences matric\n\n\n\nConclusions 235\n\nsuction that, in turn, play an important role on the mechanical behaviour of SC\nmaterial. Compressibility of SC specimens was found to be suction indepen-\ndent in the lower stress range, before yielding. On the contrary, in the higher\nstress range after yielding, curves shapes from unsaturated specimens seems to\nbe suction dependent: the higher the suction, the lower is the compressibility.\nThis was confirmed by isotropic compressibility of unsaturated samples which\nincreased with increasing water content. As so, an increasing suction produces a\nstiffening of the material with smaller plastic compressibility. However, during\nunloading sequences, compressibility appeared to be suction independent for the\ncompacted unsaturated specimens. The data confirm the general findings that\nan increased suction produces a stiffening of the material with smaller plastic\ncompressibility (Alonso et al., 1990; Cui and Delage, 1996), despite the tight\ndifferences observed between unsaturated tests.\n\nAs far as what concerns to SC, a strong influence of molding water content\non the mechanical behaviour was found at both large and very small strain do-\nmain, namely regarding strength and stiffness parameters, which is attributed\nto suction effect. Strength and stiffness increases with decreasing molding water\ncontent, i.e, with increasing suction. However, for the same state conditions,\nstrength and stiffness was found to decrease with increasing stress and strain lev-\nels, which is due to a reduction of suction effect. In what concerns to strength,\nthese trends agrees with the ones found by Estabragh et al. (2004) and dif-\nfers from Alonso et al. (1990). Stress\u2013strain curves featuring materials in a\ndense sate were obtained. Critical state had been reached in unsaturated and\nsaturated tests and a similar internal friction angle at critical state (?cs) was\nfound, thus material behaviour at critical state is independent of initial satura-\ntion condition. Concerning to stiffness, similar trends were found by Fleureau\net al. (2003). It is noteworthy that stiffness degradation curves were found to\nlie between a reference threshold shear strain given by Santos (1999). As so, the\nmaterial characterization on the very small and large strain domain enabled to\nestimate stiffness for any strain domain.\n\nA stress\u2013strain non linear behaviour featuring material in a dense state was\nalso observed from crushed aggregate (CA31.5) specimens. However, slight in-\nfluence of molding water content on the mechanical behaviour was found at large\nstrain domain, which indicates little influence of suction effect on strength and\nstiffness in the range of molding water content studied. This is probably due\nto a negligible fine fraction. Unsaturated specimens denoted higher britleness\nbehaviour, corresponding higher secant friction angles. However, in contrast\nto SC material, specimen with optimum molding water content presented the\nhighest friction angle and saturated specimens the lowest. Once again, differ-\nences become lower with increasing total mean stress level. Critical state had\nbeen reached only for saturated test. Concerning to stiffness, no significant dif-\nferences on specimens stiffness were found for strain and stress levels evaluated.\nTo this end, suction seems not to play an important role on CA31.5 material\nstiffness for the studied compaction conditions.\n\nFurther, multistage procedure was found to provide good results regarding\npeak deviatoric stresses, as long as no significant structure disturbance is exper-\nimented at each stage. However, stress\u2013strain curves present higher britleness\nbehaviour rather than triaxial single stage tests.\n\nFinally, as far as what concerns to tests on the very strain domain a setup\nusing bender elements and accelerometers was attempted. Comparison between\n\n\n\n236 Conclusions\n\nresults obtained using BE and accelerometers showed that, generally, results\nobtained with both sensors slightly differs, with exception to the specimen with\nhigher moisture content where significant differences were found. The inves-\ntigation of travel time determination showed that picking arrival time from\nboth accelerometers is straight, whereas picking bender elements arrival point\nis ambiguous. This difficulty, probably due to near\u2013field effects amplified by a\nhigh degree of saturation, led to pick the wrong arrival time, thus to mislead\ncomputation of S\u2013wave velocity. Therefore, the measurement of S\u2013waves us-\ning accelerometers as receivers appears to improve measurements quality in the\ntime domain, particularly concerning quasi\u2013saturated specimens.\n\n8.1.2 Field investigation: E?vora trial railway embankment\n(ETRE)\n\nA full scale trial was carried out involving two type of geomaterials, SC and\nCA31.5. Trial layers with different thicknesses (0.22, 0.30, 0.40 and 0.50 m)\nand different moisture contents (2% dry of optimum, optimum and 2% wet\nof optimum Modified Proctor) were constructed. Then, evaluation of state\nconditions and mechanical properties for several energy levels were carried out\nand statistical data was computed.\n\nState conditions were evaluated by means of sand cone method (SCM) and\nnuclear method (NM), the latter requiring calibration. Regarding SC trial\nlayers, average moisture content of trial layers ranged from 3% dry of optimum\nto 1.5% wet of optimum, which reflects a deviation from previously planned.\nFurther, statistical data showed higher moisture content coefficient of variation\n(CV) from SC trial layers compacted dry of optimum, rather than SC trial layers\ncompacted with moisture content wet of optimum. Concerning to CA31.5 trial\nlayers, moisture content 1% wet of optimum was achieved on layer with 0.22 m\nthickness, whereas moisture content close to optimum value was achieved on\ntrial layer with 0.30 m thickness. Moreover, moisture content strongly varied\nwithin increasing energy level. In fact, moisture content obtained from both\nlayers for the first enelgy level was about 1.5% dry of optimum.\n\nAs so, the previous stack of material, water adding and mix up by means\nof a front shovel did not reproduced the desirable moisture contents nor even\nthe desirable homogeneity. It should be noted that the adverse weather con-\nditions during construction of some trial layers might had contributed to these\nresults. This notwithstanding, dry density CV lie below maximum values given\nby Brandl (1977), with exception to SC trial layer with 0.50 m thickness. To\nthis end, layer with 0.50 m thickness does not fulfill quality control requirements\nof high quality projects, namely those regarding high speed embankments. Fur-\nther, layer thickness was found to influence relative compaction of SC trial layers\nfor the compaction equipment and energy levels studied. Relative compaction\ndecreased with increasing layer thickness.\n\nMechanical evaluation was carried out by means of static plate load test\n(SPLT) and performance related tests, namely, Soil Stiffness Gauge (SSG),\nlight falling weight deflectometer (LFWD), falling weight deflectometer (FWD),\nspectral analysis of surface waves (SASW) and Portanceme?tre.\n\nFocus was given to the evaluation of mechanical properties by means of\nSPLT which were performed following two commonly used standards,AFNOR\nNF P94\u2013117\u20131 (2000) and DIN 18134 (2001). SPLT following AFNOR was\n\n\n\nConclusions 237\n\ncarried out using two settlement measuring systems: one measuring settlement\non a point at the center of the plate through a hole; another measuring settle-\nment three concentric points on the periphery of the plate. Results from the\nformer measuring systems were found to be more than 30% higher than corre-\nsponding values obtained with the latter. Therefore, measuring settlement on\na point at the center of the plate through a hole is not recommended. Fur-\nthermore, analysis of both standards was performed and differences concerning\nto test proceed and test interpretation was found. Comparison between results\nobtained from direct interpretation of SPLTs following AFNOR NF P94\u2013117\u20131\n(2000) and DIN 18134 (2001) standards showed a difference between moduli of\napproximately 10%, where values obtained from DIN standard were the highest.\nHowever, differences between standards regarding stress level and method of in-\nterpretation were observed. Thus, interpretation for same stress level (200 kPa)\nand method (secant method) was conducted. In this case modulus given by\ntests performed following DIN standard were 15% lower than the ones achieved\nby tests performed following AFNOR standard. In addition, equivalent modu-\nlus should take into account different plates diameter if a multi\u2013layered system\nis being tested. Conclusions regarding SPLT led to the specification project\n(Gomes Correia et al., 2007) that is presented in Appendix B.\n\nThe analysis of the results from several tests methods to evaluate moduli\nallowed to establish correlations and testify equipment calibrations using SPLT\nas reference test. Good correlation between SPLT and Portanceme?tre moduli\nwas established for SC trial layers, the latter being about 10% higher than the\nformer. Although a correlation close to unity was obtained between SPLT and\nLFWD on SC trial layers, high scatter led to poor correlation. Thereby, results\nfrom this equipment should be treated with caution. No correlation was found\nbetween SPLT and the others performance related tests. Results from CA31.5\ntrial layers did not allowed to establish correlations between SPLT as reference\ntest and performance related tests. Therefore, equipments calibration for each\nkind of material is required.\n\nThese results indicate the huge potential of Portanceme?tre for the continu-\nous stiffness evaluation on earthwork platforms, being a non destructive method\neasy to operate enabling quick evaluation of moduli and large number of tests,\nwhich allows statistical analysis. Moreover, the instantly layout of moduli en-\nables immediate intervention ever quality control requirements are not achieved.\nIn addition, afterwards treatment of results allows spacial characterization of\nfull area of compacted layer. Thereby, mechanical evaluation by means of Por-\ntanceme?tre represents a great improvement on quality control/quality assurance\n(Qa/Qc) of compacted layers.\n\nThen, the influence of state conditions on the mechanical properties was\nevaluated. In what concerns to SC trial layers no moduli was found to decrease\nwith increasing moisture content confirming, thus reflecting suction effect on\nmechanical properties. Indeed, this trend is consistent with laboratory results.\nFurther, Portanceme?tre moduli CV decreased with increasing moisture content.\nThese results denote the great influence of moisture content either on average\nmoduli and on homogeneity of mechanical performance of layers embankment.\nNo clear relationship between dry density and moduli was found. With regards\nto CA31.5 trial layers, moduli was found to follow moisture content variation.\nModuli increased with increasing moisture content, as long as moisture content\nvaries between about 2% dry of optimum and optimum value. This trend indi-\n\n\n\n238 Conclusions\n\ncates the great influence of moisture content on mechanical performance rather\nthan dry density. It is noteworthy that the highest modulus was obtained for\nmoisture content close to optimum value, which is consistent with results from\nlaboratory results once again.\n\nTo sum up, great influence of moisture content was found either on average\nmoduli and homogeneity rather than density. As so, higher requirements regard-\ning compaction control should be considered regarding moisture content rather\nthan dry density, particularly when compaction is performed with moisture\ncontent on the dry side as long as compacted layers will remain in unsaturated\ncondition. Further, since mechanical properties reflect moisture conditions, con-\ntinuous evaluation of mechanical performance represents a great improvement\non compaction control. This fact highlights the great benefit using continuous\ncompaction control devices like Portanceme?tre.\n\nFinally, comparison between full scale trial and laboratory results was per-\nformed. A perfect match between shear modulus obtained from SASW and\nshear modulus given by laboratory tests was found. In addition, a maximum\ndifference of 19% between modulus obtained from SPLT following AFNOR stan-\ndard and modulus estimated from triaxial compression tests was found. These\nfindings assumes great importance taking into account two issues: (i) design is\nbased on mechanical properties usually determined from laboratory tests; (ii)\neven though conventional triaxial tests only allow determination of mechanical\nproperties beyond strain level of 1%, for SC geomatrial is possible to estimate\nsecant modulus from degradation curves for lower strain levels since degradation\ncurves lie between reference threshold for sands given by Santos (1999).\n\n8.1.3 Field investigation: Fafe trial road embankment\n(FTRE)\n\nAnother full scale trial was performed. Three types of materials were stud-\nied, namely, poor\u2013graded sand (SP) used in trial and embankment layers, inert\nsteel aggregate for construction (ISAC) used in trial, embankment and base\nlayers and crushed aggregate (CA40) used in base layers. However, only SP\nand ISAC were used in trial layers, which were constructed at optimum water\ncontent with varying thicknesses compacted with different energy levels. Like-\nwise in ETRE, a full scale trial was carried out involving state conditions and\nmechanical properties evaluation.\n\nState conditions were obtained from SCM, rubber balloon method (RBM)\nand NM tests, the last requiring calibration. NM was found to be inappropriate\nto determine state conditions of ISAC layers.\n\nMoisture content of SP trial layers ranged over 3\u20134% dry of optimum, whereas\nembankment layers varied between 1 and 3% dry of optimum. The wetting pro-\ncess employed on SP material which involved the previous stack of material,\nwatter adding and mix up by means of a front shovel and, in addition, in situ\nmoisture content correction before compaction process, did not reproduced de-\nsirable moisture conditions close to optimum. The highest moisture content CV\nwas obtained from trial layer with 0.50 m thickness, which denotes the influence\nof layer thickness on moisture content homogeneity. Nevertheless, dry density\nCV was less than 3% for all layers, which lie below limit given by Brandl (1977).\n\nFocus was given to the analysis of the results from tests methods to evaluate\nmoduli. Correlations between moduli obtained from LFWD, SSG, FWD, SASW\n\n\n\nConclusions 239\n\nand Portanceme?tre using SPLT as reference test were attempted. Concerning\nto SP material, though the data is limited, a general relationship between SPLT\nmodulus (EV2) and Portanceme?tre (EPort) moduli close to unity was found once\nagain. This means that results given by these tests are approximately the same\nvalidating the calibration method used. Correlation between SPLT and other\nperformance related tests showed differences higher than 55%. As so, due to\nlack of results of SPLT, Portanceme?tre was used as reference test to confirm\ncorrelations based on a greater number of points. However, high scatter did\nno enable sustainable conclusions. As mentioned previously, the results from\nLFWD and SSG equipment should be treated with caution.\n\nWith regards to ISAC material different conclusions were obtained. Moduli\ngiven by SPLT (EV2) and Portanceme?tre (EPort) differed approximately 45%.\nOnce more, due to lack of SPLT tests, Portanceme?tre was used as reference\ntest. Correlation between LFWD and \u2018Portanceme?tre\u201d moduli was close to\nunity (only differs 12%), while between SSG and Portanceme?tre moduli differs\n30%, yet high scatter was observed. Concerning to CA40+SP profile due to lack\nof results no sustainable conclusions were obtained. This shows the necessity of\nequipments calibration for each kind of material. Though it seems possible to\nestablish correlations between moduli of in situ performance\u2013based tests meth-\nods, material type and state conditions should be taken into account on this\nevaluation.\n\nSASW were carried out on SP embankment layer using different sources\ntypes, namely light hammer, sledge hammer and LFWD and FWD equipments.\nGood results were obtained using light hammer source, LFWD and FWD as\nsources. This findings assume great importance, specially in the case of FWD\nsince equipment has already mounted a deflection measuring system consisting\nof 8 geophones positioned along 3 meters from the center of the source (loading\nplate). Besides traditional back\u2013analysis or even static loading approach for the\ninterpretation of FWD test, data gathered from these sensors can be used to\nperform surface seismic analysis. This interpretation would allow, on one hand\nto confirm traditional back\u2013analysis regarding the number of layers and, on the\nother hand, the extraction of modulus on the very small strain domain.\n\nThen, analysis of moduli and state conditions was conducted. In contrast to\nconclusions obtained from ETRE, moisture content was found have unnoticeable\ninfluence on moduli for the range of moisture content studied, 1 to 4% dry of\noptimum. Conversely, dry density seems to influence mechanical properties.\nModuli increased with increasing dry density, as long as moisture content do not\nvary significantly. However, no relation between dry density CV and modulus\nCV was found.\n\nComparison between full scale trial and laboratory results yielded differences\nlower than 27%, laboratory moduli being higher than field moduli. This results\nassumes great importance taking into account that design is based on mechanical\nproperties usually determined from laboratory tests.\n\nFurther, an experimental program was carried out to monitor drum roller\nand layer vibrations in two phases. Phase One aimed vibrations measurement\nof the capping layer during tests, namely, LFWD, FWD, Portanceme?tre and\nroller drum. Accelerometers and strain gauges were buried on the capping layer\nenabling measurement of dynamic response and total strains. ISAC and SP\nmaterials were tested in this phase.\n\nStain measurements from SP and ISAC profiles during aforementioned tests\n\n\n\n240 Conclusions\n\nindicate different depths of influence, which can be ordered in increasing way:\nLFWD, FWD, Portanceme?tre and roller drum. However, strain measurements\ndid not always reflected moduli obtained from performance related tests, since\nhigher strains were obtained from in\u2013ground measurements in ISAC profile that\nwas found to had higher stiffness. On the contrary, in\u2013ground displacements\nobtained from acceleration measurements were consistent with profiles stiffness.\nHigher in\u2013ground displacements were found regarding SP profile than in ISAC\nprofile, which is consistent with lower modulus obtained in the former than the\nlatter. Hence, in\u2013ground dynamic response was found to reflect moduli obtained\nfrom dynamic tests performed at layer surface.\n\nComparison between in\u2013ground strains and displacements during impact\nloads LFWD and FWD on SP profile, showed consistency with theoretical ap-\nproach considering a single modulus, yet modulus obtained from both tests\ndiffered. These results highlight the importance of test methods calibration us-\ning a reference test. Moreover, it allowed to conclude higher depth of influence\nfrom plate with higher diameter. Results obtained from ISAC profile did not\nconfirmed these conclusions, which might be attributed to stationary drum tests\nbetween impact tests which induced significant differences on profile mechanical\nhomogeneity.\n\nAnalysis of in\u2013ground accelerations during Portanceme?tre and roller drum\npasses on SP profile exhibited non linear behaviour at depth of 0.10 m, while\nbehaviour close to linear appears to prevail at depth of 0.45 m. Moreover, quite\nsimilar in\u2013ground vibrations were found at higher depth, which denotes similar\ndynamic in\u2013ground response. Since roller drum and Portanceme?tre wheel dy-\nnamic behaviour reflects dynamic in\u2013ground response, this fact might indicate a\ngood correlation between mechanical properties determined from instrumented\nrollers and Portanceme?tre.\n\nOwing to the roller drum behaviour monitoring during stationary vibration\ntests, comparison between drum acceleration given by both sensors (one located\nat the top and middle of the drum and another located at the left side of the\nnon\u2013rotating mount) slightly differed for low eccentric static moments and was\nalmost the same for higher static moments. Acceleration measured at the top\nmiddle of the drum was greater and signal noise level was lower. Approximated\ndisplacements obtained from sensor on the left side were 85% lower than the ones\nobtained from sensor at the top middle. Since continuous compaction control\n(CCC) based on roller drum measurments uses displacements obtained from\ncomputed acceleration signals, this difference should be taking into account on\nstiffness determination.\n\nPhase Two involved vibrations measurement of roller drum and vibrations of\ncapping layer during compaction of base layer. Vertical drum acceleration and\ndisplacement were found to be sensitive to changes in underlying soil stiffness.\nBoth decreased with increasing soil stiffness for an excitation frequency of about\n19 Hz, which features drum vibration below the natural frequency of test bed.\nFurther, good correlation was found between drum vibration and SPLT modulus\nobtained from ISAC and CA40+SP profiles. In addition, at 0.65 m depth strain\nlevels induced by SPLT were similar to the ones induced by roller drum, denotes\nidentical depth of influence. These findings shows that SPLT modulus is related\nto drum behaviour and, therefore, should be used as reference test.\n\nConcerning in\u2013ground vibrations measurements, similar trend to drum be-\nhaviour was found, i.e., accelerations and computed displacements decreased\n\n\n\nProspective work 241\n\nwithin number of passes on both profiles, that is the same to say with increas-\ning stiffness. Therefore, in\u2013ground dynamic response measured by means of\nin\u2013ground accelerometers denotes close relation to drum behaviour, as was con-\ncluded from Phase One. On the other hand, results from in\u2013ground strains were\ninconclusive.\n\n8.2 Prospective work\n\nAs future work hydro\u2013mechanical behaviour of SC geomaterial in unsatu-\nrated condition should be investigated using suction measurement apparatus in\norder to get a better insight on the interpretation of both laboratory and field\nresults. On one hand, it would allow effective stress analysis and validate matric\nsuction obtained from filter paper method and, on the other hand, to validate\ntheoretical effective stress approaches.\n\nTaking into account the apparent influence of dry density on the mechanical\nbehaviour of SP material for slight variations of moisture content, a laboratory\ncampaign is required in order to confirm this behaviour.\n\nThe measurement of S\u2013waves velocity by means of bender elements and ac-\ncelerometers requires calibration using materials with well known properties.\nFurther, interpretation technique of accelerometers signal in the frequency do-\nmain is necessary in order to compare with results obtained from time domain.\n\nRegarding mechanical evaluation by means of field tests, full scale trials em-\nploying different materials would be useful in order to establish correlations\nbetween mechanical tests. Further, it allows to get state parameters and me-\nchanical properties variation, which information is of great interest on the be-\nhaviour analysis and design involving reliable analysis.\n\nIn addition, full scale trials should be performed coupled with \u201cintelligent\nrollers\u201d promoting and validating this technology (Parente, 2010). Moreover,\ninvestigations using in\u2013ground sensors (strain gauges, cell pressures and ac-\ncelerometers) should be carried out. Vibration characteristics of the roller drum\nshould be continuously monitored enabling the loading action of the drum to\nbe characterized. This information would be then used to develop numerical\nmodels of the interaction roller drum\u2013material behaviour during compaction\nprocess.\n\nThe FWD appears to be a promising device to evaluate modulus in the\nvery small strain domain, besides large strain domain. This equipment applies\nimpact loads and has already mounted a deflection measuring system consisting\nof 8 geophones positioned along 3 meters from the center of the source (loading\nplate). As so, besides traditional back\u2013analysis or even static loading approach\nfor the interpretation of FWD test, data gathered from these sensors could\nbe used to perform seismic analysis of surface waves. This interpretation would\nallow the extraction of low strain modulus. This would represent a great benefit\non the mechanical evaluation of road and railway platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\nAbu-Farsakh, M.

If an oscillating loading is applied to a homogeneous unbounded elastic\nspace, two types of waves will emanate from the loading: volumetric waves and\nsurface waves.\n\nFrom the two types of volumetric waves generated from an energy source,\nthe one of most interest in this study is the shear wave. Since the pore fluid\ndoes not have shear stiffness, only the soil skeleton propagates S\u2013waves. As a\nresult, the shear modulus G of a material is related to the velocity of a shear\nwave through it by:\n\nG = ? \u00b7 V 2s (A.1)\n\nwhere ? is the density.\n\nFor an isotropic elastic soil the effective stress elastic parameters are related\nby:\n\nE = 2 \u00b7 G \u00b7 (1 + ?) (A.2)\n\nOn contrast, P\u2013waves can be propagated also by the pore fluid. Therefore,\nin saturated, unconsolidated materials, P\u2013wave velocities are often controlled\nby the bulk stiffness of water.\n\nThere are several ways to obtain the shear modulus either in the field or\nin laboratories in the small strain domain. In situ methods to determine shear\nmodulus are generally described as a part of geophysical surveying, they all have\n\n259\n\n\n\nthe principle of sending waves through the ground and recording them in differ-\nent points, and the wave distortion and speed are interpreted to give information\nabout the soil from which they pass. There are many methods available to cre-\nate artificial waves like the Cross\u2013Hole (CH) and Down\u2013Hole (DH) methods,\nthe seismic cone penetration test (SCPT) and the spectral analysis of surface\nwaves (SASW).\n\nMeasurement of soil stiffness in laboratory throughout the small strain (about\n10?5 up to 10?3) can be made using local gauges attached directly to the spec-\nimen (Goto et al., 1991; Hoque et al., 1997), while throughout very small strain\nrange (strains below 10?5) can be made using dynamic methods, such as reso-\nnant column and bender element method (Santos, 1999; Ferreira, 2008). Since\nbender elements were used in laboratory tests, only bender element method will\nbe focused.\n\nA bender element is a piece of piezo\u2013ceramic elements which distort or bends\nif a voltage across it is changed or, if bent by an external force, the voltage across\nit changes. The transducers are made of bimorphs in which two sheets of piezo-\nelectric material are fused together. When a voltage is applied to it, depending\non the materials polarity, it will either contract or expand, and similarly when\nit expands or contracts it produces a voltage. Therefore if a voltage is applied\nto both sides of the bender element, one side will lengthen while the other will\nshorten. This in turn will cause the bender element to flex in one direction, and\nthen in the opposite direction when the voltage is reversed as shown in Figure\nA.1.\n\nBender elements may be assembled to operate in two different ways: parallel\nor series (fig. A.1). In parallel bimorphs, the electrodes are on the outside\nof each plate, but these are connected together to the same terminal and the\ncentral conductor is connected to the other terminal. The plates are polarized in\nthe same direction in this case. In series bimorphs the electrodes on the outside\nof each plate are connected to a voltage source and the plates are polarised\nin opposite direction. They develop twice the voltage of those connected in\nparallel for the same driving force and they provide only half the displacement\nof parallel elements for the same applied voltage. To this end, a suitable setting\nshould use a parallel bender element as the source and a series bimorph as the\nreceiver.\n\nBender elements are usually set into the top and bottom platens of a triaxial\nor oedometer cell and penetrate into the specimen a small distance. Mounted as\ncantilever beams, one element is vibrated by changing the voltage across it. The\nmotion of the bender element initiates a shear wave to propagate through the\nsoil specimen. When the shear wave reaches bender element some distance away,\nit causes it to flex and thus producing a voltage between the electrodes. The\ninput voltage (created using a function generator) and the received signal are\nmonitored using a digital oscilloscope, allowing the travel time to be determined.\nThen, velocity can be computed using following Equation:\n\nV =\nL\n\nt\n(A.3)\n\nwhere V is the wave velocity, L is the distance between the tips of source and\nreceiver bender elements, and t is the travel time. The dynamic elastic shear\n(G) and Young (E) moduli can then be determined through equations A.1 and\n\n260\n\n\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure A.1: (a) Series connected bimorph bender element; (b) parallel connected\nbimorph bender element\n\nA.2.\nAlthough in principle the use of bender elements appears to be straight for-\n\nward, in practice their use can lead to ambiguous and uncertain results. This\nhas led to a great deal of research focused on the principles and assumptions\nunderlying their use. The convenience of bender element tests is limited by\nsubjectivity associated with identifying wave travel time and uncertainties sur-\nrounding the validity of some interpretation methods. Doubts exist regarding\nthe influence of transducer support conditions on the characteristics of transmit-\nted waves and the importance of reflected components on received waveforms\n(Dyvik and Madshus, 1985; Brignoli et al., 1996; Viggiani and Atkinson, 1995).\nThe received signals can be distorted by near field effects, cross\u2013talking and\nsample size effects.\n\nA.2 Near\u2013field effects\n\nThe first deflection of the signal may not correspond to the arrival of the shear\nwave but to the arrival of the so\u2013called near\u2013field component which travels with\nthe velocity of a compression wave (Sa?nchez-Salinero et al., 1986).\n\nTheoretical studies on three\u2013dimensional transmission of waves through an\ninfinitive elastic body have been performed and described in detail by Sa?nchez-\nSalinero et al. (1986). They presented fundamental equation solution for shear\nwaves which are composed of three terms. In a simplified form shear wave\ncomponents can be generally represented as:\n\nS = Sfar?field, traveling at Vs + Snear?field, traveling at Vs\n+Snear?field, traveling at Vp\n\n(A.4)\n\nIn simplified terms, two of the components of a shear wave propagate at\nthe shear wave velocity Vs, while the other component propagates at the com-\npression wave velocity Vp. The terminology \u201cfar\u2013field\u201d and \u201cnear\u2013field\u201d denote\ndifferent attenuations with distance. The near\u2013field components attenuate much\n\n261\n\n\n\nfaster than the far\u2013field so, although their contribution is important very near to\nthe source, it rapidly decreases with distance from the source. Analytical studies\nof this phenomenon can be found in Arroyo et al. (2003) and Rio (2006).\n\nFrom the previous can be concluded that these near\u2013field effects may mask\nthe arrival of the shear wave when the receiver is located at a near distance\nfrom the source, adding difficulties when choosing the arrival point. Near\u2013\nfield effects in bender element tests have been recognized by many researchers\n(Viggiani and Atkinson, 1995; Brignoli et al., 1996; Jovicic et al., 1996). From\ntheir experimental observations was showed that the near\u2013field effect could be\nreduced by increasing the frequency of the transmitted signal in such a way that\nat least two wavelengths should travel in the length of the specimen. This limit\nis represented by the following expression:\n\nN = Rd =\nL\n\n?\n=\nL \u00b7 f\n\nVs\n? 2 (A.5)\n\nOn the contrary, others have found it difficult to ever obtain a clear shear\nwave arrival (Gajo et al., 1997; Pennington, 1999). These apparent problems\nand the need for a definitive, objective criterion for determining shear wave\ntravel time from any type of input signal led Arroyo et al. (2003) to look in\nmore detail at the often quoted Sanchez\u2013Salinero solution. According to their\nanalysis, acceptable results are found if phase or group velocity is measured at\nmore than about 1.6 normalized distances (or travel lengths) from the source.\nThe frequency adjustment to limit near\u2013field influence has been translated into\nthe following expression:\n\nflim =\nVs\n?\n>\n\nVs\n1.6 \u00b7 L\n\n(A.6)\n\nA.3 Cross\u2013talk\n\nCross\u2013talk is associated to electromagnetic coupling between source and re-\nceiver bender elements. This phenomena manifests as an output signal with an\nearly component that is quasisimultaneous with the input signal (Santamarina\net al., 2001), as can be observed in Figure A.2. This cross\u2013talk can be very\nimportant in conductive soils, such as saturated soils.\n\nLee and Santamarina (2005) conducted an experimental study to explore\ncross\u2013talk associated with the different wiring of the transducers, either in se-\nries or in parallel\u2013type bender elements. This problem can be overcome by\nproperly grounding the bender element and the use of parallel to series ben-\nder element combination (Lee and Santamarina, 2005). Brocanelli and Rinaldi\n(1998) improved received signal by coating the bender element with conductive\nsilver paint over the insulating epoxy resin and grounding it. Through a process\nof trial and error, by handling the different elements of the circuit, Rio (2006)\nconcluded that cross\u2013talk phenomena can occur at different points of the cir-\ncuit. The physical proximity of the plugs in the electronics equipments and the\nlack of grounding of the testing apparatus are some of the aspects that may\ncontribute to the presence of crosstalk.\n\nSince it may sometimes be impossible to eliminate this phenomena, measures\nshould be taken to improve received signal. High magnitude of the output signal\nresults on a high signal\u2013to\u2013noise ratio, which enables to minimize cross\u2013talk.\n\n262\n\n\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure A.2: Bender element measurements in different testing setups: (a) no\nevidence of cross\u2013talk; (b) clear presence of cross-talk in the output signals\n(Ferreira, 2008)\n\nOn the other hand, low amplitude of the output signal results on a low signal\u2013\nto\u2013noise ratio which enhances this phenomena. Whenever a high amplitude of\nthe received signal is not achieved, additional measures should be taken by the\nuser for correct interpretation. One way involves choosing frequency in such a\nway that at least two wavelengths should travel in the length of the specimen,\nallowing to distinguish cross\u2013talk portion of the signal from the arriving of the\ntrue shear wave. This measure assumes greater importance if the interpretation\nis performed in time domain. Another way consists on the use of numerical\ntools to remove the initial portion of the signal since the frequency and location\nof this error are known. Then, the equivalent filtered signals can be used for\nfrequency domain analyses (Rio, 2006).\n\nA.4 Sample size effects\n\nArroyo et al. (2003), Arroyo et al. (2006) Lee and Santamarina (2005) and\nRio (2006), Kuwano et al. (2008) findings suggest that near\u2013field effects were\nunable to justify the observed measurement uncertainty. To some extent these\nlimitations have been related to sample size effects, which importance in bender\ntesting has been signaled by other researchers (Blewett et al., 2000; Arroyo et al.,\n2002; Theron et al., 2003; Greening and Nash, 2004).\n\nPropagation of waves in a confined medium is influenced by the reflection of\nwave components at its boundaries. This is the case of the triaxial or oedometer\ntests, where bender elements are mostly commonly installed. In the first case\n\n263\n\n\n\nthe soil specimen is surrounded by water, oil or air, while in the second case soil\nspecimen is contained in a steel ring. Consequently, sample geometric properties\nwill determine the influence of reflection of wave components in bender element\ntests. This is the same to say that so\u2013called sample size effects will depend on\nthe particular test configuration.\n\nUsually bender elements are incorporated into the upper and lower load\nplatens of triaxial and oedometer apparatus. In most cases, therefore, bender\ntests proceed as a pulse transmission test along the sample axial direction. Ar-\nroyo (2001) examined in depth the problem of sample size effects in cylindrical\nspecimens in this configuration. Two different phenomena may play a role here:\nthose linked to end reflections from the loading platens, and those due to re-\nflections from the lateral sample boundaries. According to Arroyo et al. (2006),\nwhereas the first may be incorporated with relative ease into an elastodynamic\nmodel of the soil transmission subsystem, the second are harder to deal with,\nparticularly when compounded with end reflections.\n\nIn this sense Arroyo et al. (2006) and Rio (2006) showed how sample size\nof cylindrical specimen due to lateral boundary reflection affects the results of\nbender element test by the 3D numerical simulation. In order to establish an\nanalogy between boundary conditions and laboratory setups, the authors stud-\nied two cases that can be translated into two opposite types of lateral boundary\nconditions: reflecting and absorbing boundaries. In general, the higher the\nimpedance of the confining media relative to that of the soil, the higher the pro-\nportion of energy reflected back into the sample. This means that oedometer\ntests with metallic boundaries will be very close to the perfectly reflecting case;\nthe same will apply for dry soil and triaxial conditions. The case of saturated\nsoil and triaxial conditions is less clear\u2013cut, and probably intermediate between\nthe perfectly absorbing and perfectly reflecting conditions. These authors show\nclearly the influence of the reflected wave components in the received signals.\n\nRio (2006) shows the simulation results for a standard triaxial specimen\n(model A of 100 \u00d7 50 mm, with a slenderness of 2) and for a specimen model\nB (100 \u00d7 75 mm), for the cases of reflecting (non\u2013absorbing) and absorbing\nboundaries (see fig. A.3). For the absorbing case, first arrival occurs at the\nexpected instant with less distortion than non\u2013absorbing case, where first arrival\ndoes not occurs as expected and larger distortions of response can be observed.\nThe author also shows that response of the non\u2013absorbing model results from the\noverlap of responses for non\u2013absorbing and absorbing conditions. This proofs\nthe importance of wave reflection caused by sample geometry and boundary\nconditions, which are complex issues, especially for the interpretation of BE\nresults in the time domain (Ferreira, 2008).\n\nArroyo et al. (2006) also simulated cylindrical specimens with different slen-\ndernesses and absorbing and non\u2013absorbing boundaries conditions. Figure A.4a\npresents the same representative section for the Ba (200 \u00d7 50 mm) and Aa\n(100 \u00d7 50 mm) models with absorbing lateral boundaries. The time histories\nare very similar. The same happens for the Bna and Ana models with non\u2013\nabsorbing lateral boundaries, as shown by the sections in Figure A.4b. Joint\nconsideration of these figures shows the striking differences in the wave shapes\ninduced when the nature of the lateral boundaries is changed. The sections in\nFigure A.4c show that there was indeed no appreciable difference between mod-\nels Ca and Cna (model with dimensions 100 \u00d7 400 mm): the lateral boundaries\nare so distant that they have negligible influence on the propagating motion.\n\n264\n\n\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure A.3: Time history of received pulse signals for model A (100 \u00d7 50 mm)\nand model B (100\u00d775 mm): (a) non\u2013absorbing models A and B, and absorbing\nmodel B; (b) non\u2013absorbing and absorbing model A and reflected signal (Rio,\n2006)\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure A.4: Time histories for soil movements 88 mm from bender tip for models\nwith absorbing lateral boundaries: (a) Aa and Ba; (b) Ana and Bna; (c) Can\nand Ca. Spikes indicate theoretical arrival times of bulk P and S waves (Arroyo\net al., 2006)\n\nA.5 Travel distance determination\n\nThe main task when using bender elements is to calculate the shear wave\nvelocity. Once the travel time between the transmitting and receiving bender\n\n265\n\n\n\nelement has been measured, it should be a simple matter to calculate the shear\nwave velocity, following Equation A.3, which means by diving the travel distance\nby the travel time. However, there are several difficulties for travel length and\ntravel time determination.\n\nThe tip\u2013to\u2013tip distance is the most commonly assumed by a variety of au-\nthors (Dyvik and Madshus, 1985; Viggiani and Atkinson, 1995; Brignoli et al.,\n1996; Pennington et al., 2001), although not always justified. It corresponds to\nthe minimum distance between transducer tips. This assumption is supported\nby data gathered with bender elements and resonant column tests by Dyvik and\nMadshus (1985). They observed that the results from the bender element test\nfitted best the resonant column results for travel distances measured tip\u2013to\u2013tip.\nViggiani and Atkinson (1995) conducted laboratory tests on samples with dif-\nferent heights. For different confining pressures the sample length was plotted\nagainst the travel time. The chosen linear relationship between the results from\ndifferent samples, at similar stress states, indicate the correct travel distance to\nbe the tip\u2013to\u2013tip distance. Brignoli et al. (1996) performed tests with bender\nelements as well as with shear\u2013plates on samples with different heights, also\ncoming to the conclusion that the correct travel distance must be measured\nbetween tip\u2013to\u2013tip.\n\nAlternatives to the tip\u2013to\u2013tip travel distance are proposed by some authors.\nFam and Santamarina (1995) used the distance between mid\u2013embedded height\nbut did not justify it. Rio (2006) conducted a series of bender element tests\non artificial polyurethane samples, covering a large range of sample heights,\ntravel distances and relative embedment heights. The results indicated that the\nwave travel distance should be measured not between transducers tip\u2013to\u2013tip\nbut between about 60% of the transducers embedment height, coinciding with\nthe estimated centres of dynamic pressure exerted by the transmitter bender\nelement on the sample. Arulnathan et al. (1998) states that the travel time\ncan be also measured by comparison of the first and the second arrival of the\nwave in the output signal using the second arrival method. This is possible\ndue to reflection at the ends of the specimen. Lee and Santamarina (2005)\nuses multiple reflections method where the S\u2013wave reflections from end plates\nare enhanced by maximizing the soil\u2013plate impedance mismatch. The authors\nstate that this method solves uncertainty not only in travel time but also in\ntravel distance: as shown in Figure A.5, the travel distance between the first\nand the second event is always the twice the plate\u2013to\u2013plate distance given by\nthe following expression.\n\ndpp = 2 (L + 2Lb) (A.7)\n\nThe tip\u2013to\u2013tip distance has been herein adopted. During the course of a\ntest, the deformation experienced by the specimen was taken into account, and\nincluded in the computation of travel length.\n\nA.6 Travel time determination\n\nThe determination of the travel time is more controversial. Determination of\ntravel times of elastic waves from bender elements for calculus of the shear wave\nvelocity of laboratory soil specimens may be done using time domain techniques\nand frequency domain techniques (Dyvik and Madshus, 1985; Brignoli et al.,\n\n266\n\n\n\nFigure A.5: Multiple\u2013reflection method (Lee and Santamarina, 2005)\n\n1996; Ferreira, 2003). Jovicic (2003) claims that the measurement should be\ntaken in the time domain preferably directly from the screen because automatic\ninterpretation of arrival times using numerical processing (frequency domain)\nusually does not consider changes in boundary conditions during the course of\na test. In contrast, Ferreira (2003) indicates that time domain techniques seem\nto overestimate shear wave velocity and G0.\n\nRegarding time domain technique, this method of interpretation assumes\nplane wave\u2013fronts and the absence of any reflected or refracted waves (Arul-\nnathan et al., 1998). A typical output signal gathered from a step input signal\nis presented in A.6.\n\nFigure A.6: Typical S\u2013wave signal within near field: (A) first deflection, (B)\nfirst bump maximum, (C) zero after first bump, and (D) major first peak (Lee\nand Santamarina, 2005)\n\nIdentifying at which point the shear wave arrives (A, B, C or D) is open to\nuser interpretation. The problem arises due to a phenomena described previ-\nously, such as near field and sample size effects. Suggested criteria and recom-\nmendations vary depending on installation, application, and input signal (Dyvik\nand Madshus, 1985; Fam and Santamarina, 1995; Viggiani and Atkinson, 1995;\nJovicic et al., 1996; Lee and Santamarina, 2005; Arroyo et al., 2006). Although\npoint A indicates the very first deflection of the shear wave, it has contrary\npolarity. As mentioned above, this phenomenon is assigned to dispersion, either\nby near\u2013field effects or wave reflections at the boundary conditions. Hence, this\npoint does not correspond to the first arrival of the shear wave. The first arrival\nof the shear wave is most likely located between points B and C. Point B is\nlocated at the first trough of the wave, at the start of the main sinusoidal cycle,\nwhile point C is located where the main cycle crosses zero, as depicted in the\n\n267\n\n\n\nfigure by the zero intercept dashed line. Herein point B adopted as the arrival\ntime.\n\nAlternative methods in time domain technique were explored by Arulnathan\net al. (1998) and Lee and Santamarina (2005) based on second arrival of the\noutput. As mentioned previously, this is possible due to reflection at the ends\nof the specimen. However, second arrival of the wave is often undetected in the\nsignal, since it contains less energy than the first arrival. That is the case of\nstandard triaxial tests with high specimens due to large travel distances. In this\nresearch specimens of 200 mm high were used and, therefore, this method was\nnot applied.\n\nAlternative signal processing procedures have been explored to avoid \u201cpick-\ning\u201d a travel time, including cross correlation and frequency domain analyses.\nFor further details one should consult Ferreira (2008).\n\nAs has been noted, time domain techniques are generally simple and straight-\nforward, as the travel time can be directly defined from the measurement of the\ntime interval between characteristic points in the transmitted and received wave\ntraces. However, the input signal is given by the function generator and may not\nexactly correspond to the input bender element signal (Lee and Santamarina,\n2005). Besides, near\u2013field and sample size effects contributes to distortion of\nthe output signal and leads to misinterpretation. On the other hand, frequency\ndomain techniques tend to be more elaborate, as these are supported by signal\nprocessing and spectrum analyses tools, and enable automated data acquisition\nand processing. However, computed signals are not of \u201csame nature\u201d, which\nalso may lead to misinterpretation.\n\nIn this sense, Ferreira (2008) found that the exclusive use of either method\nproved to be unreliable. Therefore, a practical framework for bender element\ntesting was recently proposed by Viana da Fonseca et al. (2009), combining two\ndistinct interpretation methods, in the time and the frequency domain, as a\nmeans to effectively reduced the uncertainty and subjectivity often associated\nwith bender elements testing and obtain the most reliable value for the travel\ntime.\n\nThe issues highlighted above can be overcome if two sensors acting as re-\nceivers are used. Ferreira et al. (2010) proposed the instrumentation of spec-\nimens with two accelerometers in combination with bender elements. In this\nsetup, the signal produced by the bender element transmitter is acquired by\nthe bender element receiver and by the two accelerometers. The advantages of\nthis setup are twofold: i) the interpretation of the acceleration measurements\ncan be directly made both in the time and in the frequency domain, since the\nsignals are of the same nature; ii) these measurements can be used to verify the\nbender element signals, and thus minimize the subjectivity of the interpretation\nof bender element results.\n\n268\n\n\n\nAppendix B\n\nSpecification project of\nSPLT\n\n269\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECIFICATION \n\nPROJECT June 2007 \n \n\n \nSTATIC PLATE LOAD TEST \n \nDETERMINING THE DEFORMATION MODULUS BY THE STATIC PLATE \nLOAD TEST (Ev2) \n \n \nContents Page \n \n1.\t\n \u00a0 SCOPE .................................................................................................................................................. 2\t\n \u00a0\n2.\t\n \u00a0 NORMATIVE REFERENCES .......................................................................................................... 2\t\n \u00a0\n3.\t\n \u00a0 SYMBOLS AND ABBREVIATIONS ................................................................................................ 2\t\n \u00a0\n4.\t\n \u00a0 TEST PRINCIPLE .............................................................................................................................. 3\t\n \u00a0\n5.\t\n \u00a0 APPARATUS ....................................................................................................................................... 3\t\n \u00a0\n\n5.1.\t\n \u00a0 REACTION LOADING SYSTEM .......................................................................................................... 3\t\n \u00a0\n5.2.\t\n \u00a0 LOADING PLATE .............................................................................................................................. 4\t\n \u00a0\n5.3.\t\n \u00a0 COMMAND AND MEASURING DEVICE OF LOAD APPLIED TO THE PLATE ........................................... 4\t\n \u00a0\n5.4.\t\n \u00a0 SETTLEMENT MEASURING DEVICE .................................................................................................. 5\t\n \u00a0\n5.5.\t\n \u00a0 AUXILIAR EQUIPMENT .................................................................................................................... 5\t\n \u00a0\n\n6.\t\n \u00a0 TEST PROCEDURE ........................................................................................................................... 6\t\n \u00a0\n6.1.\t\n \u00a0 TEST SETUP ..................................................................................................................................... 6\t\n \u00a0\n6.2.\t\n \u00a0 PRELOADING ................................................................................................................................... 6\t\n \u00a0\n6.3.\t\n \u00a0 LOADING AND UNLOADING ............................................................................................................. 6\t\n \u00a0\n\n7.\t\n \u00a0 RESULTS ............................................................................................................................................. 7\t\n \u00a0\n8.\t\n \u00a0 TEST REPORT .................................................................................................................................. 10\t\n \u00a0\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\np. 2 de 10 \n\n1.

This test enable the determination of modulus known as \u201cdeformation modulus \n\nunder static plate loading\u201d of platforms. \n\nThis test is intended for use in earthworks and infrastructures of roads, railways and \n\nairports, where maximum material dimension under the plate do not exceed \u00bc plate \n\ndiameter. \n\nThis specification project specifies a method which permits the relationship between \n\nload and settlement to be determined, the aim being to assess the deformation \n\ncharacteristics of geomaterials and determine strain modulus. The maximum modulus \n\nvalue to be measured with this test is 250 MPa. The deformation modulus under static \n\nplate loading does not features the relative compaction of platforms. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.

TEST PRINCIPLE \n\nAfter choosing test site, two successive loading cycles are applied to material, \n\naccordingly normalized procedures, through a plate with diameter and stiffness \n\nnormalized. \n\nThe first loading cycle is applied in successive increments and then load is released in \n\nstages. The procedure is repeated for a second loading cycle. For each stage, the average \n\nnormal stress under the plate, ?0, is plotted against plate settlement and the a load-\n\nsettlement curve is obtained. \n\nThe deformation modulus under static plate loading, Ev2, expresses material \n\ndeformation characteristics and is computed from the second loading cycle of the load-\n\nsettlement curve. \n\n \n \n \n\n5. APPARATUS \n\nThe following equipment is required: \n\n - reaction loading system; \n\n - plate loading apparatus; \n\n - command and measurement device of load applied to the plate; \n\n - settlement measurement device. \n\n \n\n5.1. REACTION LOADING SYSTEM \n\nThe reaction loading cycle shall produce a reaction load which is at least 10% greater \n\nthan the maximum test load required. The reaction loading system supports should be at \n\nleast 1,20 m far away from the center of the loading plate. \n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\np. 4 de 10 \n\n5.2. LOADING PLATE \n\nThe loading plate diameter is 600 mm \u00b1 2 mm, for tests on materials which maximum \n\nparticle dimension not exceeding \u00bc of loading plate diameter. \n\nThe loading plate stiffness shall be in such a a way that under a applied force, F, equal \n\nto 10 \u00b1 0,5 kN at its center, deflection, f, between plate center and plate edge measured \n\naccordingly Figure 1, does not exceed 0,2 mm. \n\n \n1 \u2013 Steel cylinder \n\ndiameter: 20mm \u00b1 1 \n\nlength: 600mm \u00b1 5 \n\n2 \u2013 Solid with stiffness similar to a concrete block with approximate dimensions:: \n\nL = c = 1 m e h=0,5m \n\nRoughness tolerance of superior face: \u00b1 1 mm \n\nFigura 1 \u2013 Scheme for loading plate stiffness verification. \n\n \n\nAlso a loading plate with diameter 300 mm \u00b1 0,5 mm can be used. A minimum \n\nthickness of 50 mm \u00b1 0,2 mm is required to guarantee stiffness condition of loading \n\nplate. \n\n \n\n5.3. COMMAND AND MEASURING DEVICE OF LOAD APPLIED TO THE \nPLATE \n\nThe device shall allow a normal load to be applied to the plate inducing a normal stress \n\nunder the plate of 0,25 MPa, for plate with 600 mm diameter, and 0,50 MPa, for plate \n\nwith 300 mm diameter. Suitable means shall be provided to prevent buckling of \n\nelements and guarantee vertical forces. Loading speed shall satisfy conditions given in \n\nsection 6.2.  \n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\np. 5 de 10 \n\nDevice shall also enable measurement of loads applied to the plate as described in \n\nsection 6.2 and, if required, shall allow load sustain during settlement stabilization.  \n\nThe load on the plate shall be measured by means of a strain gauge with a limit of error \n\nof 1% and resolution of the gauge shall be at least 0,0001 MPa for 600 mm loading \n\nplate and at least 0,001 MPa for 300 mm loading plate. \n\n \n\n5.4. SETTLEMENT MEASURING DEVICE \n\nThe resolution of settlement measuring device shall be at least 0,01 mm and shall enable \n\nmeasurements at least 10 mm. \n\nThe following measuring systems can be used: \n\n- one point measuring system located less than 20 mm of the center of the plate; \n\n- three points measuring system located concentrically on the periphery of the loading \n\nplate at 120\u00ba \u00b1 10\u00ba and at same distance, a, from the center of the loading plate (a \u00b1 5 \n\nmm). \n\nThe supports of the measuring systems shall be located at 1,50 m far away from the \n\ncenter of the plate and from supports of the reaction loading system. \n\n \n\n5.5. AUXILIAR EQUIPMENT \n\nThe following auxiliar equipment is required: \n\n\u00a7? spade; \n\n\u00a7? rule to level with, at least, 0,8 m length; \n\n\u00a7? bucket with, at least, 20 liters of clean sand 0/2 mm; \n\n\u00a7? trowel; \n\n\u00a7? hand brush; \n\n\u00a7? protection element against weather conditions if measuring device used is \n\nsensible to meteorological agents. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\np. 6 de 10 \n\n6. TEST PROCEDURE \n\n \n\n6.1. TEST SETUP \n\nRecord measurement point coordinates. Test area with 0,7 m x 0,7 m shall be levelled \n\nwith rule. A clean sand layer shall be put on the test area and spread and levelled with \n\ntrowel in such a way to achieve a thin layer. \n\nThe loading plate shall lie in the center of this surface in full contact with the material \n\nbeing tested. This may be achieved by rotating the plate back and forth in angles of 30 \n\nto 45\u00ba. \n\nThe loading device shall be placed centrally on the loading plate beneath the reaction \n\nloading system and measuring device shall be placed accordingly the requirements \n\ngiven in sections 5.3 and 5.4. \n\nIf necessary protection element against weather conditions shall be installed. \n\n \n\n6.2. PRELOADING \n\nPrior to starting the test, the strain gauge and the dial gauge or displacement transducer \n\nshall be set to zero and the plate preloaded for about 30 seconds. The load applied shall \n\ncorrespond to a normal stress of 0,01 MPa 600 mm plate. The reading of the gauge or \n\ntransducer at this load shall be taken as zero reading. \n\n \n\n6.3. LOADING AND UNLOADING \n\nThe load shall be applied in not less than six stages, in approximately equal increments, \n\nuntil the required maximum normal stress is reached. Each increase in load (from stage \n\nto stage) shall be completed within one minute. The load shall be released in stages, to \n\n50% and 25% of the maximum load and then to the load corresponding to the zero \n\nreading. Following that, a further (2nd) loading cycle shall be carried out, in which the \n\nload is to be increased only to the penultimate stage of the first cycle (see Figure 2). \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\np. 7 de 10 \n\n \nFigure 2 \u2013 Load-settlement curve for determination of deformation modulus, Ev2. \n \n\nWhen testing soil, the time interval between the application of each load increment shall \n\nbe two minutes, the load being held constant during this period.  \n\nIf a test proceeds in an unexpected manner (e.g. if the loading plate tips or sinks \n\nrapidly), the soil at the test site shall be dug up to a depth equal to the plate diameter. If \n\nstones are encountered, or if the soil is of less than stiff consistency, this shall be \n\nrecorded. \n\nIf, during the loading cycle, a higher load than intended is inadvertently applied, this \n\nload shall be maintained and a note made in the records. \n\nNOTE: In order to check the results obtained from the second loading cycle, a third \n\ncycle may be carried out to the same maximum load, this being applied immediately \n\nafter the second loading stage, without any further intermediate stages. \n\n \n\n \n\n7. RESULTS \n\nThe deformation modulus, Ev2 (secant modulus), shall be calculated using Boussinesq \n\nequation: \n\n \n\n( )\nz\ndp\n\nEv\n?\n\n???= 22 14\n?\n\n?\n\n \n \n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\np. 8 de 10 \n\nwhere: \n\nz represents plate settlement on the second loading cycle, expressed in milimeters; \n\n?, p, d are, respectively, coefficient of Poisson, average stress under the plate, expressed \n\nin MPa and plate diameter, expressed in milimeters. \n\n \n\nThe plate settlement, z, shall be based on smooth load-settlement curve by adjustment of \n\na second degree polynomial. To this end, settlement, z, on the plate center shall be \n\ncalculated using following equation: \n\n \n2\n02010 ?? ?+?+= aaaz  \n\n \n\nwhere: \n\n?0 is the average stress under the plate, in MPa; \n\na0, a1, a2 are factors in mm, mm/MPa and mm/MPa2. \n\n \n\nFactors a0, a1, a2 are obtained from adjustment of a second degree polynomial to the \n\nload-settlement curve, not being considered the initial value (zero). \n\n \n\nAs so, the deformation modulus, Ev2 (secant modulus), shall be calculated using \n\nfollowing equation: \n\n( )\n2\n0201\n\n2\n2 14 ??\n\n?\n?\n\n?+?\n\n?\n???=\n\naa\ndp\n\nEv  \n\n \n\nEv2  shall be calculated for a stress under the plate of 0,20 MPa. However, the \n\nevaluation of this parameter can be performed for any stress level of the second loading \n\ncycle. \n\n \n\nIn the next tables is given an exemple of measured values during a test and the results \n\ninterpretation for evaluation of deformation modulus, Ev2. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\np. 9 de 10 \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Measured values obtained from the first loading cycle. \n\nLoading stage Load (kN) Stress ?0 (MPa) z (mm) \n\n0 0,00 0,000 0,00 \n\n1 11,78 0,042 0,60 \n\n2 23,56 0,083 1,20 \n\n3 35,34 0,125 1,70 \n\n4 47,12 0,167 2,14 \n\n5 58,90 0,208 2,52 \n\n6 70,68 0,250 2,90 \n\n7 35,24 0,125 2,77 \n\n8 17,62 0,062 2,55 \n\n9 0,00 0,000 1,71 \n\n \n\nTable 2 \u2013 Measured values obtained from second loading cycle. \n\nLoading stage Load (KN) Stress ?0 (MPa) z (mm) \n\n10 0,00 0,000 1,71 \n\n11 11,78 0,042 2,06 \n\n12 23,56 0,083 2,34 \n\n13 35,34 0,125 2,58 \n\n14 47,12 0,167 2,80 \n\n15 58,90 0,208 2,96 \n\n16 24,36 0,086 2,78 \n\n17 12,18 0,043 2,49 \n\n18 0,00 0,000 2,01 \n\n \n\nTable 3 \u2013 Results interpretation \n\nParameter 2nd loading cycle \n\n?0max (MPa) 0,208 \na0 (mm) 1,716 \n\na1 (mm/MPa) 8,505 \na2 (mm/MPa) -12,117 \n\n( )\n2\n0201\n\n2\n2 14 ??\n\n?\n?\n\n?+?\n\n?\n???=\n\naa\ndp\n\nEv  72,6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\np. 10 de 10 \n\n8.
