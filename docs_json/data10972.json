These elements application, with thin-walled sections, is increasingly while maintaining a significant load bearing capacity. These slender cross-sections provide greater susceptibility to the occurrence of local instability phenomena in the respective cold-formed profiles. Additionally, the global instability of the elements and the distortional buckling related to the existing of reinforcements in the section are also very common collapse modes in these profiles. These instability phenomena are intensified when the profiles are subjected to high temperatures, such as the ones in case of fire. The present study, which focuses on the determination of the ultimate strength of cold-formed steel columns, beams and beam-columns at high temperatures, is based on non-linear numerical analyses with imperfections, using the finite element software SAFIR. In order to validate the different numerical models applied, numerical analysis of different cold-formed profiles experimental tests at normal and high temperatures was performed. Subsequently, a parametric study was carried out to understand the influence of different parameters for numerical modelling (such as initial imperfections, residual stresses and the corner enhancements) and to stablish case studies to be considered in the validation of cold-formed steel columns, beams and beam-columns design proposals. Through the parametric studies performed varying the cross-sections slendernesses, temperatures, steel grades and loading types, the ultimate loads numerically obtained are compared with the resistances provided by Eurocode 3 prescriptions, for these profiles. And finally, following the observations obtained with such comparisons, new design formulations are proposed that improve the analytical predictions of the different structural elements at high temperatures.\nFor every problem there\u2019s a challenge, for every challenge there\u2019s a solution.\n(Aman Dhanda)\nContents\nList of

The use of these profiles in construction began around 1850 in the United States and United Kingdom, but the biggest application on residential construction began at the end of the Second World War, in Japan, due to the mass destruction and lack of wood to build new habitational buildings (Silvestre et al., 2013). The cross-section geometry is very often conditioned by the intended application, which leads to a large variety of cross-sections shapes and sizes (Figure 1.1). Most common cold-formed steel profiles cross-sections geometry are C, Z, S and Q.\nFigure 1.1 - Most common section types according to their application, for columns and beams\nThe cold-formed profiles are commonly used in buildings due to its lightness and ability to support large spans, being quite common as roof or walls support elements (Silvestre and Camotim, 2010a).\nSome of general advantages provided by cold-formed steel structural members in building constructions are (Yu, 2000): the lightness; the ability to support large spans; the high strength and stiffness; the faster manufacturing process and with relatively light loads; the easy prefabrication and mass production; the favourable strength-to-weight ratios; the cross-section\u2019s shape allowing the compact packaging; the economy in transportation, handling and the sustainability on construction (Silvestre et al., 2013). Compared with other materials, the combination of previous qualities can result in cost saving in construction.\nOn the other hand, the structural steel elements with thin-walled sections are characterized by being able to have the possibility of failure modes occurrence such as\nlocal, distortional and global (for example, lateral-torsional buckling on elements under bending and flexural buckling on elements under compression). The instability phenomena and its influence on the ultimate strength at normal temperature have been widely studied (Gon\u00e7alves and Camotim, 2007; Silvestre and Camotim, 2010b).\nHowever, cold-formed steel elements behaviour in fire has only recently received the same attention. In fact, the fire resistance evaluation of cold-formed profiles has a major role in the design of these elements. According to Sidey and Teague (1988), the cold-formed steel strength can suffer a reduction of 10 to 20% more than that for hot rolled steels due to the metallurgical composition. For high temperatures, cold-formed steel profiles are likely to lose the strength that they gained through manufacturing process at normal temperature. For these reasons, there are differences between the degradation characteristics of mechanical properties of hot-rolled and cold-formed steels at elevated temperatures. The French National Annex (FN Annex) from Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 (EC3) (CEN, 2007) recommends appropriate reduction factors for hot-rolled and cold-formed steel profiles with Class 4 cross-sections at high temperatures.\nFigure 1.2 shows an example of the effect of a fire in a building with cold-formed profiles applied as roof support elements.\nFigure 1.2 - Cold-formed profiles as roof support elements after a fire on Vagos, Portugal, 2017\nThe fire resistance analysis of these elements can be performed using calculation methods with various complexity levels, ranging from those based on simplified methods defined in the Eurocodes, to more complex ones with non-linear analysis, based on the finite element method and included in the designated advanced calculation methods. To better capture local instabilities, the resistance of building structures with thin-walled profiles has been calculated using advanced methods with finite shell elements.\nThis thesis presents a research on the behaviour of cold-formed steel members (beams, columns and beam-columns) under fire situation based on numerical analysis. Numerical models are developed and validated against experimental tests from literature. After an extensive study about these profiles under the influence of different considered parameters, proposals for new design formulae are made.\n1.2\tContextualization of the thesis topic\nIn 1729, Van Musschenbroek started the first experiments of centrally compressed prismatic bars and, as a conclusion, he presented an empirical formula for column strength depending on column length, where the buckling load was inversely proportional to the square of the length of the column (Timoshenko and Gere, 2012).\nThirty years later, at 1759, Euler obtained the mathematical analysis for this empirical formula. According to this research, the column behaviour is analysed by using the linear theory based on linear elastic material property and small deflection approximation of the element. A straight column (considered as a perfect column) remains straight from the beginning of loading process and to produce a small deflection on the column the load must reach a critical value. Below this critical load, the column would not suffer any deflection, as it is explained on Chapter 2 of this document.\nHowever, the previous theories were not accepted by engineers until 1846, when Lamarle gave a logical explanation to the discrepancy between Euler's and Musschenbroek's theories. If the fundamental assumptions of the perfect material elasticity and under ideal conditions at the ends were satisfied, the Euler's theory is in agreement with the Musschenbroek's results (Timoshenko and Gere, 2012).\nVon Karman (1908, 1910) and Chwalla (1928) started plastic studies of beam-columns. At 1932, Von Karman proposes the Effective Length Method, which is still a current method applied on post-buckling analysis (Chen and Atsuta, 2007).\nGeorge Winter and his collaborators, since 1939, started an investigation on structural behaviour of cold-formed steel structures conducted at Cornell University resulting in the development of many works about design methods considering the effective width method for stiffened compression elements, web crippling of thin-walled sections,\nbeams lateral buckling, flexural buckling of thin-walled steel columns, flexural-torsional buckling of concentrically and eccentrically loaded columns (beam-columns) in the elastic and inelastic ranges, as well as the effects of manufacturing processes on material properties (occurrence of residual stresses). Thus, Winter became known as \u201cthe father\u201d of cold-formed steel leading this effort until his retirement in 1975 (Yu and LaBoube, 2010).\nTakahashi and Mizuno (1978) publish a paper describing the distortional instability phenomenon that can occur on thin-walled open sections. The range of the other buckling modes (local and flexural-torsional) in a lipped channel cross-section column were presented by Hancock (1984). Years later, Lau and Hancock (1990) developed simple analytical expressions to allow the distortional buckling stress to be calculated for different dimensions of thin-walled lipped channel columns cross-sections. Kwon and Hancock (1992) studied lipped channel cross-sections (with and without stiffeners) under fixed boundary conditions, choosing also a particular yield strength to ensure that a substantial post-buckling strength reserve occurs in a cross-section distortional mode. According to Serrette and Pekoz (1995) the distortional buckling has an important role on flexural members or decking sections behaviour.\nDavies and Jiang (1996) applied the Generalized Beam Theory (GBT) to analyse the individual buckling modes separately and combined. Applying the same theory, Silvestre and Camotim (2002) described and discussed the various steps involved in deriving analytical distortional buckling formulae for cold-formed steel lipped channel elements, and Narayanan and Mahendran (2003) studied the distortional buckling strength for more complex cross-section geometries.\nOne of the first studies of residual stresses, on cold-formed steel elements, was published by Ingvarsson (1978) for columns with two channel cross-sections welded together and by Weng and Pekoz (1988b) for cold-formed steel channel sections. Relevant studies on residual stresses were also presented by Schafer and Pekoz (1998a).\nOn 1998, the University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR) starts developing a better understanding of the behaviour of cold-formed steel members due to the increase of residential construction market (Yu and LaBoube, 1998). Since this moment, a huge number of research works about the structural behaviour of cold-formed profiles have been developed up to today.\nAccording to Kaitila (2002), the increase of the local imperfections magnitude leads to a relative straightforward decrease of initial stiffness of the elements, while the global imperfections magnitude have more influence in the ultimate load. However, the distortional buckling failure may also be affected by initial geometric imperfections.\nAbout cold-formed steel members subjected to elevated temperatures there are here presented some studies on its behaviour.\nLee (2004) performed his PhD research work about the local buckling behaviour and design of cold-formed steel compression members at elevated temperatures. The experimental and numerical results demonstrated that the local buckling stress at high temperatures highly depends on the deterioration of the elasticity modulus. Therefore, the theoretical equation for local buckling stress could be simply modified considering a reduced elasticity modulus.\nA research work develop by Feng et al. (2004) allowed to conclude that the normal temperature buckling curve for columns in ENV1993 Part 1-3 (CEN, 2001b) was not clearly adapted for fire design since it will overestimate column strength, and also to conclude that the buckling curve for columns in ENV1993 Part 1-2 (CEN, 2001a), originally developed for hot-rolled steel, seemed to produce safe and acceptable results.\nA numerical simulation of catenary action in cold-formed steel sheeting in fire was performed by Lu et al. (2007) and concluded that the sheeting structure bent and buckled upwards first due to thermal expansion and axial restraints when connecting the sheeting to the supports causes high compression force in the structure. As a consequence, the structure deforms rapidly with high deformation values due to stiffness degradation when increasing the temperature. It was also possible to conclude that the catenary force in the structure has a significant role to sustain the applied load.\nAn experimental study of the mechanical properties for light gauge cold-formed steels at high temperatures was developed by Ranawaka and Mahendran (2009). New predictive equations were developed for the determination of yield strength and elasticity modulus at high temperatures, as well as a new stress-strain model for high strength cold-formed steels. An improvement was proposed to this equations in case of low strength steels by Kankanamge and Mahendran (2011).\nAlso Ranawaka and Mahendran (2010) developed a finite element model capable of simulating the distortional buckling behaviour on cold-formed steel elements under compression at normal and high temperatures. The validated model was used to investigate the effect of different types of distortional buckling mode, initial geometric imperfections, residual stresses and mechanical properties. The results demonstrated the importance of the exact use of the mechanical properties at high temperatures in fire safety projects of cold-formed steel elements under compression.\nA parametric study on the behaviour of cold-formed steel lipped channel beams subjected to lateral-torsional buckling at elevated temperatures was performed by Dolamune Kankanamge and Mahendran (2012) and the Part 1-2 of EC3 (CEN, 2005b) predictions were found to be over-conservative for all the temperatures.\nIn the research work of Lopes et al. (2012, 2013) and Arrais (2012) the influence of initial geometrical imperfections on the determination of the ultimate loads of cold-formed steel beams and columns at high temperatures was analysed and it was concluded that these imperfections are relevant to the determination of those ultimate loads, thus they should be considered. The influence of residual stresses was also analysed and it was concluded that they did not have significant impact on the resistance values when considered all the initial geometric imperfections combined.\nLaim et al. (2014) concluded on an experimental analysis on cold-formed steel beams subjected to fire that these elements can fail in a variety of buckling modes (local, distortional and lateral-torsional buckling) at normal and elevated temperatures, observing that the lateral-torsional buckling mode was the main failure mode responsible for the collapse of the open beams and the distortional buckling mode the responsible for the collapse of the closed built-up beams.\nArrais et al. (2014) performed a parametric study of the lateral-torsional buckling behaviour of simply supported members with cold-formed lipped channel sections, in case of fire. The influence of different steel grades, cross-sections slenderness and loading types was evaluated and new design rules were proposed.\nA research project occurred on Czech Republic, between 2014 and 2015, on the behaviour of cold-formed purlins at fire conditions where the main investigator was the Ing. Michal Jandera, Ph.D. The aim of the project was to develop an analytical model of\ncold-formed thin-walled sections behaviour in fire and to obtain their resistance. The model should be based on a substantial parametric numerical study (GMNIA) made in general Finite Elements Software ABAQUS that should be validated on an experimental investigation. On the same topic, Chaves (2014) developed a study on cold-formed purlins at fire conditions connected to sheeting, analysing the EC3 rules approximation to numerical ultimate loads.\nGunalan et al. (2015) focused their research on local buckling studies of columns at high temperatures and concluded that the design predictions at normal temperature can be used to predict the local buckling capacities at elevated temperatures by applying the reduced mechanical properties. Part 1-2 of EC3 recommends the use of the effective area calculated at ambient temperature, but it results in too conservative predictions at high temperatures.\nLaim et al. (2015) analysed sigma section beams behaviour at normal and high temperatures. The conclusion from this study was that cold-formed steel beams with web stiffeners may have different structural responses under fire conditions depending on the section shape. Sigma beams presented similar critical temperatures to the lippedchannel beams, regardless the boundary conditions, double-sigma beams behaved differently from the lipped-I beams.\nFire tests of cold-formed profiles continue to be important, to improve numerical models and develop more and more studies to further deepen the knowledge about this topic. In this regard, Muftah et al. (2016) and Craveiro et al. (2016) performed some fire tests of cold-formed steel columns to understand the fire behaviour of these members and to obtain the respective fire resistance to apply them on numerical studies and compare the results with the standard rules.\nJaved et al. (2017) performed a review about the most recent research about cold-formed steel members at high temperatures. Basically, the research gaps about this topic, as well as some recommendations, were also proposed. The general conclusions are about how to find the real temperature distribution across the section and along the length of the elements and about the large deflections that is recommended the study of semi-rigid end restraints conditions.\nThe present thesis theme is within the line of the above mentioned researches, and its development took these and other investigations in consideration.\n1.3\tThesis planning and organization\n1.3.1\tMotivation\nCold-formed steel profiles have been increasingly used in architectural and structural applications on residential, commercial and industrial buildings, incorporated into wall, floor and roof panels. This interest over the years derives from their high mechanical and corrosion resistance, the easy maintenance and for pleasing appearance, as well as its structural efficiency expressed by the high ratio between mechanical resistance and weight when compared to the hot-rolled profiles, contributing to a substantial reduction in the consumption of steel.\nHowever, the fire design rules for some of these profiles have demonstrated to be too conservative. The EC3 fire part is sometimes unclear on some aspects to take into account for cold-formed steel elements, being widespread to all the steel elements type.\n1.3.2\tObjectives\nThe main objectives of this research work were to increase the knowledge on the fire behaviour of cold-formed steel elements and to study and develop, if necessary, simple design rules for these elements (beams, columns and beam-columns).\nMore specific objectives of the present research work were:\n\u2022\tto analyse experimental studies characterizing the fire behaviour of cold-formed steel sections from the literature, for the numerical models validation;\n\u2022\tto perform a parametric study of cold-formed steel profiles behaviour varying the geometry of the element cross-section, the length of the element, the steel grade, the loading type and the different boundary conditions;\n\u2022\tto compare the obtained numerical results for the ultimate loads with the simplified calculation formulae prescribed in Parts 1-2 of EC3;\n\u2022\tand, if necessary, to propose new design methodologies;\n1.3.3\tThesis organization\nThe present work has been divided into seven chapters.\nThe first and current chapter provides a general introduction to the different subjects addressed in this work. The main objectives are also described as well as the motivation to develop this research.\nIn Chapter 2, some general concepts and fundamentals of structural stability related to the subject of the research work as well as stability analysis concepts are presented. Different types of stability analysis, initial imperfections and some specific methods of analysis are presented.\nThe Chapter 3 is dedicated to the presentation of structural elements design according to the EC3, including cross-section and members resistance.\nA range of different experimental tests performed by different authors are modelled and analysed on Chapter 4, where important considerations are drawn for the numerical analysis presented in Chapter 5.\nAt the numerical analysis performed on Chapter 5, different parameters are considered to obtain useful numerical models and to perform comparisons with the EC3 prescribed design rules.\nWith the adopted numerical models, the obtained results are compared with the EC3 design rules on Chapter 6, finishing with the development of new design rules for cold-formed profiles at high temperatures that are on the safe side and have a better agreement with the numerical results.\nFinally, on Chapter 7 the full conclusions are presented as well as some proposals for future works.\nChapter 2\nGeneral structural stability concepts and fundamentals on cold-formed profiles\n2\tGeneral structural stability concepts and\nFUNDAMENTALS ON COLD-FORMED PROFILES\n2.1\tGeneral considerations\n2.2\tInstability phenomena\n2.2.1\tStructural behaviour of cold-formed profiles\n2.2.2\tBuckling modes\n2.2.2.1\tLocal instability\n2.2.2.2\tDistortional instability\n2.2.2.3\tGlobal instability\n2.2.2.4\tInteraction between buckling modes\n2.2.3\tPlates behaviour\n2.2.3.1\tIndividual plate loading analysis\n2.2.3.2\tCold-formed steel sections as composition of plates\n2.3\tUltimate bearing capacity\n2.3.1\tImperfections influence\n2.3.1.1\tInitial geometric imperfections\n2.3.1.2\tResidual stresses\n2.3.2\tLoad-carrying capacity analytical determination\n2.3.3\tApproximate numerical methods\n2.3.3.1\tFinite Element Method (FEM)\n2.3.3.2\tFinite Strip Method (FSM)\n2\tGeneral structural stability concepts and\nFUNDAMENTALS ON COLD-FORMED PROFILES\n2.1\tGeneral considerations\nAll engineering problems involve equilibrium. Stability concepts and analysis are going to be explored in this section with special focus on cold-formed steel elements.\n2.2\tinstability\n2.2.1\tStructural behaviour of cold-formed profiles\nThe equilibrium state of a structure subjected to a given \u201caction\u201d can be \u201cstable\u201d or \u201cunstable\u201d. When this structure is subjected to a compressive force/stress sufficiently high, the tendency is to lose its stiffness and the geometry can be changed, becoming unstable. With the occurrence of the instability phenomenon, the structure loses it load capacity and cannot find a stable equilibrium configuration.\nThe use of thin-walled sections and cold-forming processes can result in some design problems on cold-formed steel structures, not normally found on thick hot-rolled steel structures. Some of these problems are mentioned below (Dubina et al., 2012; Yu, 2000).\nDue to the high slenderness of the individual components of cold-formed steel members and the low torsional stiffness on thin-walled open cross-sections, these elements can buckle. The different instability modes depend on the buckling length (section 2.2.2).\nCold-formed sections are usually thin. Open cross-section steel members are more likely to undergo torsional deformation due to their low torsional rigidity resulting from their thin walls. Additionally, if the sections are loaded eccentrically, which typically occur in mono-symmetric sections where the shear centre doesn't coincide with the centroid (Figure 2.1), the torsional buckling becomes a critical factor for these elements.\nOn open cross-sections, warping is a phenomenon that can occur and influence the deformation mode, when subjected to bending moment. On beam-columns the warping torsion is easy to control with simple equations for lateral buckling. End conditions have a big influence on mechanical resistance (Figure 2.2).\nFigure 2.2 - Torsion with unrestrained and restrained warping (Adapted from Dubina et al. (2012))\nWebs may cripple if end and intermediate stiffeners are not in used in cold-formed steel structural members, due to the high local or reaction intensity (Figure 2.3). There are other reasons for web crippling: in some cases, the webs are not vertical and have a slight inclination; the depth-to-thickness ratios of cold-formed members web are normally larger than hot-rolled members\u2019.\nFigure 2.3 - Web crippling of cold-formed structural members without stiffeners (Winter, 1970)\nTo increase de strength of cold-formed steel sections, edge and intermediate stiffeners should be applied. Figure 2.4 shows the resistance increasing in function of the number of stiffeners.\nFigure 2.4 - Influence of edge and intermediate stiffeners at the cross-section resistance (Adapted from Silvestre and Camotim (2006))\nDue to the effect of cold-forming and stiffeners, the yield stress increases but the\nductility is lower (Figure 2.5).\nFigure 2.5 - Steel hardening process before/after cold-forming (Ver\u00edssimo, 2008)\n2.2.2\tBuckling modes\nBuckling is an instability phenomenon which occurs normally on thin plates, when subjected to forces in-plane. The perfectly plane thin plate element from Figure 2.6, with a x b dimensions, is simply supported along all four edges and subjected to axial compression on minor direction size (x direction).\nFigure 2.6 - Simply supported plate uniformly compressed in x direction (Reis and Camotim, 2001)\nApplying a ax stress, deformations out of the plate plane can occur, returning to the initial position when removed the stress that created this deformation, if \\x has a reduced value.\nThe smallest stress not imposing permanent deformations is called elastic critical buckling stress, \\cr. If \\x is lower than \\cr the plate naturally acquires its initial position after unloading, but when the \\x value is higher than \\cr, the plate deformation still increasing, suffering buckling (Beg et al., 2010; Reis and Camotim, 2001; Vila Real, 2004).\nAs it is known, most of cold-formed profiles have a very thin wall, which leads to having a high susceptibility to suffer instability phenomena. The instability mode depends on the length of the element, its cross-section (shape and size) and boundary conditions.\nWith regard to the stability behaviour and instability modes, a bar with thin wall section can be classified according to their length as (Prola, 2001):\n\u2022\tShort bar - if instability occurs with a local mode;\n\u2022\tLong bar - if instability occurs with a global mode;\n\u2022 Intermediate bar - if instability occurs in a combination of a local mode with a\nglobal mode (distortional mode).\nIt is also possible to obtain the elastic buckling stress and identify the corresponding instability modes (see Figure 2.7).\nShort bar\nIntermediate bar\nLong bar\nFigure 2.7 - Buckling stresses, bar length and respective instability modes (CEN, 2006a)\nSome of these examples with lipped-channel sections studied with finite strip analysis are presented (Figure 2.8 and Figure 2.9).\n2.2.2.1\tLocal instability\nCold-formed steel elements are a set of long plates connected by the longitudinal borders (Figure 2.10). This instability mode is characterized by small half-wave lengths comparing with other instability modes and half-wave lengths are in the order of the width of individual plate elements (Figure 2.11) (Yu and LaBoube, 2010).\nFigure 2.10 - Hat-section beam local instability of top flange (Winter, 1970)\nFigure 2.11 - Square and rectangular plates subjected to compression stress (Adapted from Yu and LaBoube (2010)\nThe compression critical stress acr from Figure 2.11 can be taken as (CEN, 2006b):\nd8E\t/t\\\n\u00b0cr = k \u00b0E = k 12(1-v2h\\b)\n(2.1)\nFor local instability there is a specific configuration of the cross-section elements:\n\u2022\tThe longitudinal internal corners only suffer rotation, absent of translation movement;\n\u2022\tDeflection of internal walls causes section deformations, as opposite to external walls that have a free edge, therefore they undergo rigid element displacements;\n\u2022\tAs already mentioned, local plate mode origin small half-wave lengths which are in the order of the width of individual plate elements and creates an \u201cundulated shape\u201d on element walls;\n\u2022\tEdge conditions of the element only influence the local plate mode of end crosssection, not on the rest of the element.\n2.2.2.2\tDistortional instability\nDistortional instability mode has been considered as one of the most important limit states for cold-formed steel elements with edge-stiffened compression (Yu and LaBoube, 2010). This instability mode is characterized by half-wave lengths 5-10 times larger than local half-wave lengths, not always considered as a local instability mode, and by the stiffness buckling.\nOn flange distortional instability, the flange and the stiffness rotate about web-flange union with some rotational resistance provided by the web (Figure 2.12). This type of instability mode only occurs in open cross-sections such as C, Z and Z sections (Moen and Schafer, 2009).\nFigure 2.12 - Distortional modes: a) axial compression; b) bending (Pala, 2006)\nFor distortional instability there is a specific configuration of the cross-section elements as showed on Figure 2.12:\n\u2022\tThe longitudinal internal corners suffer rotation;\n\u2022\tPart of the cross section suffers distortion and the other undergoes rigid element displacements of the internal walls;\n\u2022\tOn stiffeners, they suffer high warping displacements;\n\u2022\tEdge conditions of the element influence the elements shape.\n2.2.2.3\tGlobal instability\nGlobal instability, also called as Euler instability mode (Euler buckling), defines the full member instability at long half-wave lengths, including both flexural and flexural-torsional effects (Figure 2.13) for columns and lateral-torsional effects in beams (Trahair, 1993).\na) Flexural\nb) Torsional\nFigure 2.13 - Forms of global instability\nIn this instability:\n\u2022\tCross-sections of the element do not suffer deformations; they undergo rigid element displacements (only flexural and torsional movements of all crosssection). None cross-section element suffers distortion;\n\u2022\tCritical global modes of flexural or flexural-torsional create a single half-wave length. A beam simply supported at both directions, with torsional rotation prevented and warping allowed at both ends, the half-wave length is the element length. In other examples with different support conditions, the number of halfwave lengths may be different (Figure 2.14);\n\u2022\tEdge conditions of the element influence the elements shape because of their significant warping displacements.\nThis instability mode becomes critical for longest and un-braced elements.\nFigure 2.14 - Half-wave lengths according to support and load conditions (Arrais, 2012)\n2.2.2.4\tInteraction between buckling modes\nInteraction between buckling modes is a set of phenomena that affect the behaviour of geometrically non-linear structural systems characterized by simultaneous or almost simultaneous occurrence of buckling modes (Reis and Camotim, 2001). On cold-formed steel elements, this phenomenon is more certain to occur due to its high slenderness. These buckling modes may occur on elastic or elastic-plastic behaviour. However, plasticity occurs on an advanced post-buckling behaviour, which leads to the modes arise mostly in the elastic behaviour. Therefore, it is considered that the collapse of these elements occurs when one reaches the limit of proportionality of steel.\n2.2.3\tPlates behaviour\nPlates study was always a complex problem to solve in engineering. There are different variables to study which are considered on engineering solutions, involving rectangular plates with infinite equations that difficult the precision of the obtained results. The real problems join multiple plates and the solution becomes even more complicated. The buckling theory of compressed plates is the basis of I-beams design. The beams flanges can be designed as long plates under a uniform compression where it is assumed that one of the ends is simply supported and the other is free. On the other hand, the web can be designed as a long plate, considering the two closer ends simply supported.\nThe stresses caused by bending moment in an I-beam are shown in Figure 2.15, where the flanges are subjected to uniform normal stresses and the web is subjected to nonuniform normal stresses.\nFigure 2.15 - Stresses in a I-beam due to bending (Reis and Arrais, 2014)\nThe member behaviour it will be defined by the behaviour of individual plates. The bending theory of thin plates is similar to the theory of beams but considering the effects in two different directions.\nOn numerical studies, different problems of instability usually occur. Therefore, it is important to understand the different behaviours of simple plates under different loading and boundary conditions types.\n2.2.3.1\tIndividual plate loading analysis\nHere are presented some common situations that occur on cold-formed steel elements plates. For each solicitation the respective buckling mode on individual simply supported plate is presented. The considered situations are:\n\u2022 a plate simply supported in its four edges, subjected to uniform uniaxial\ncompression (a = 1), as shown in Figure 2.16.\nFigure 2.16 \u2014 Plate under uniform uniaxial compression (Reis and Arrais, 2014)\nConsidering the plate as an internal compression element, the buckling modes for different dimensions are presented on (Figure 2.17):\na)\tb)\nFigure 2.17 - Buckling modes of plates in compression: a) 1000x250 mm2 and b) 1000x2000 mm2\n\u2022 a plate simply supported in its four edges, subjected to bending, as shown in\nFigure 2.18.\nFigure 2.18 - Plate subjected to bending (Reis and Arrais, 2014)\nConsidering the plate as an internal bending element, for a = 0, the results are on\nFigure 2.19.\na)\tb)\nFigure 2.19 - Some buckling modes of plates in bending (k = 0): a) 1000x250 mm2 and b) 1000x2000 mm2\nAnd considering the plate as an internal bending element, for a = _1, the buckling shape is observed in Figure 2.20.\na)\tb)\nFigure 2.20 - Some buckling modes of plates in bending (k = \u20141): a) 1000x250 mm2 and b) 1000x2000 mm2\n\u2022 a plate simply supported in its four edges, subjected to shear, as shown in Figure\n2.21.\nFigure 2.21 - Plate subjected to shear (Reis and Arrais, 2014)\nConsidering the plate as an internal element under shear, the effect observed is presented in Figure 2.22.\na)\tb)\nFigure 2.22 - Some buckling modes of plates in shear: a) 1000x250 mm2 and b) 1000x2000 mm2\nFor each type of load, an internal element may have quite different plate behaviours. It is important to recognise and to know how to identify the different types of buckling modes to interpret the numerical results.\n2.2.3.2\tCold-formed steel sections as composition of plates\nConsidering a numerical model of a lipped-channel cross-section beam under bending action, for a = \u20141, on Figure 2.23 it is possible to observe the first buckling mode (local buckling) of a beam and the plate behaviour of the flange similar to a plate simply supported under compression and the plate behaviour of the lip similar to a plate simply supported on three edges and free in the fourth edge under bending action, for = 0.5.\nFigure 2.23 - First buckling mode of a beam in bending, k = \u20141 and the respective individual plates behaviour\nFor another C cross-section beam under bending action example, ^ = \u20141 (Figure 2.24), it is possible to observe the first buckling mode (local buckling) where the plate behaviour of the web is similar to a plate simply supported under bending.\nFigure 2.24 - First buckling mode of a beam in bending, k \u2014 \u20141, base on the buckling mode of a plate in bending (web)\nAnd considering a numerical model of a beam under bending action, for ^ \u2014 1, Figure 2.25, it is possible to observe the first buckling mode (local buckling) of a beam with a specific length (small length) and the plate behaviour of the web similar to a plate simply supported under shear.\nFigure 2.25 - First buckling mode of a beam in bending, k = 1, based on the buckling mode of a plate in shear (web)\nIt is possible to understand the element's behaviour knowing the typical plate behaviour under different boundary conditions and loading types. In this way, some particular problems on numerical models can be easily interpreted.\n2.3\tUltimate bearing capacity\nConsidering the imperfections is fundamental for the ultimate bearing capacity determination. Numerical and analytical main methods are generically here presented.\n2.3.1\tImperfections influence\nReal structures do not exhibit, in general, bifurcation instabilities due to the existing of initial geometric imperfections (Reis and Camotim, 2001). However, the critical elastic bifurcation load influences significantly the structures behaviour and its ultimate load.\n2.3.1.1\tInitial geometric imperfections\nAll the structures are imperfect. Imperfections can be from geometric shapes, residual stresses and yield strength distribution across the section. Geometrical and material imperfections are functions of plate width and thickness, and of the forming process.\nAccording to Schafer and Pekoz (1998a), the geometric imperfections are related to the deviation of an element from \u201cperfect\u201d geometry. Imperfections include bowing, warping and twisting such as local deviations characterized by dents and regular plate waves.\nIn practice, each element has it deviation from a perfect geometry due to manufacturing process, storage, transportation, handling and installation. Following Part 1-5 of EC3 (CEN, 2006b), geometric imperfections may be based on the shape of the critical plate buckling modes with amplitudes given in the National Annex, where it is recommended 80% of the geometric fabrication tolerances.\nThe geometric imperfections and residual stresses characterization is largely complicated. Cold-formed steel elements post-buckling is difficult to predict if geometric imperfections and material non-linearity exist. However, allowance for these imperfections may be achieved incorporating geometric imperfections which values reflect all imperfection types. According to Part 1-1 of EC3 (CEN, 2005a), global and local imperfections should be taken into account. Distortional imperfection is an intermediate state between local and global imperfections that should be considered depending on their big influence on the numerical models. These buckling mode shapes could be determined for local imperfections with the highest value of b/100 multiplied by 0,8 (CEN, 2006b), or according to recent studies with the value of 10% of the wall\nthickness, t (Basaglia and Camotim, 2011; Borges Dinis and Camotim, 2010). For global buckling mode, the global imperfections were considered with a sinusoidal shape given by the expression:\ny = 0,8 \u2014 sinf\u20141\n750 \\ L )\n(2.2)\nFollowing Part 1-5 of EC3 (CEN, 2006b) a combination of the previous enunciated buckling modes is introduced on a numerical model. According to this rule, in combining imperfections, a leading imperfection should be chosen and the accompanying imperfections may have their values reduced to 70%.\n2.3.1.2\tResidual stresses\nCold-formed steel elements begin as thick, molten, hot steel plates. Each slab is typically hot-rolled, the thickness cold reduced and annealed to subsequently be rolled up and transported as a thin sheet of elements for cold-formed producers. At forming moment, the steel sheet is unwound by a production line and plastically folded to obtain the final shape of the desired element (roll-forming process). This manufacturing process imparts residual stresses and plastic strains through the sheet thickness (Lankford et al., 1985).\nResidual stresses of cold-formed steel elements affect it stiffness and may cause a premature initial deformation which will cause the ultimate strength reduction. Residual stresses can be from two different types: flexural and membrane (Figure 2.26).\nFigure 2.26 - Definition of flexural and membrane residual stresses through the thickness (Schafer and Pekoz, 1998a)\nFlexural residual stresses are compressive in the inner surface and tensile in the outer surface. On the other hand, membrane residual stresses are compressive or tensile and are the same through the entire thickness (Weng and Pekoz, 1988a).\nIn hot-rolled steel elements residual stresses do not exhibit big variation through the thickness, but on cold-formed steel elements residual stresses are dominated by a \u201cflexural\u201d. This can cause the early yielding on the faces of cold-formed steel plates (Schafer and Pekoz, 1998a).\nThe cold-rolling process causes different residual stresses on cross-sections when compared to press-braking process, on cold-forming. Therefore, the cross-section resistance may be different when buckling and yielding interact (Hancock, 1997) (Table 2.1).\nTable 2.1 - Type magnitude of residual stresses in steel section (ASRO (2008))\n\tForming Method\t\t\n\tHot-rolling\tCold-forming\t\n\t\tCold-rolling\tPress braking\nMembrane residual stresses (orm)\tHigh\tLow\tLow\nFlexural residual stresses (Orf)\tLow\tHigh\tLow\nOn cold-formed steel elements, the membrane residual stresses present, in general, small values when compared with flexural residual stresses (Schafer and Pekoz, 1998a).\nPi et al. (1998) adopted the residual stresses configuration recommended by Weng and Pekoz (1988a) but with a small adaptation of the model. As mentioned previously, there are tension residual stresses on the outside surface of the section, and compression residual stresses on the inside surface. Their values are assumed to be varied linearly through the plate thickness and are different for linear or curved section members. According to Weng and Pekoz (1988a), the magnitudes of the maximum tension and compression residual stresses are assumed to be the same and are taken as 50% of the yield stress for straight members, and 65% of the yield stress for corners. These residual stress distributions satisfy bending moment equilibrium conditions (Eq. 2.3 and 2.4) but not the axial force equilibrium conditions (Eq. 2.5).\nI ar.y. dA = 0\t(2.3)\nJ A\n\u2014 I ar.x. dA = 0\t(2.4)\nJ A\n\\r. dA V 0\t(2.5)\nThat occurs because the outside corner area, with tensile residual stress, is larger than the inside corner area, with compressive residual stresses. So, Pi et al. (1998), to satisfy both equilibrium conditions, replaced the 65% of the yield stress for corners to \u20140.65u@(2 ti/t) for inside surface and +0.65o@(2 t0/t) for outside surface, where:\nt\u00bf = yr2 X rt X t2/2 \u2014 r\nto\tt t\u00bf\n(2.6)\n(2.7)\nWith r the corner radius and t the corner thickness (Figure 2.27).\nFigure 2.27 - Residual stresses distribution a) around the C-section, b) through section wall at flats and lips, c) through section wall at corners (Pi et al., 1998)\nA research developed by Schafer and Pekoz (1998a) allowed a distribution of residual stresses as a percentage of yield stress for two cold-forming processes, cold-rolling and press braking, for cold-formed steel C-sections, which values are presented on Table 2.2 and Table 2.3. The results are distributed by elements where the residual stresses were measured: corner, flange, lip and web.\nTable 2.2 - Membrane residual stresses as %fy\n\tCold-rolling\t\tPress braking\t\nElement\tAccurate\tAdopted\tAccurate\tAdopted\nCorner\t6.8\t7\t5.2\t5\nFlange\t3.9\t4\t0.9\t1\nLip\t7.9\t8\t0.2\t0\nWeb\t-1.7\t-2\t0.9\t1\nTable 2.3 - Flexural residual stresses as %fy\n\tCold-rolling\t\tPress braking\t\nElement\tAccurate\tAdopted\tAccurate\tAdopted\nCorner\t26.8\t27\t32.7\t33\nFlange\t23.5\t23\t8\t8\nLip\t6.7\t7\t56\t56*\nWeb\t38.9\t39\t16.9\t17\n*Some lips are flame-cut, thus distorting this value. Value not adopted for residual stresses configuration.\nThe residual stress model adopted by Schafer and Pekoz (1998a) is shown on Figure\n2.28 with the flexural residual stress configuration for two cold-forming processes.\nFigure 2.28 - Bending residual stresses for a) cold-rolling process and b) press braking process (Schafer and Pekoz, 1998a)\nIn fire conditions, Franssen (1993) argues that the residual stresses are not lost with temperature increasing. The residual stresses behaviour and effect are different being less influential as the temperature increases and for largest lengths.\nHowever, according to Lee (2004), residual stresses will be lost when the element is exposed to elevated temperatures. Therefore, it must be taken into account a reduction factor for the residual stresses at high temperatures. This reduction factor is obtained by the following linear equation (Eq. 2.8), obtained by the same author which depend on the element temperature, or by interpolating the values presented on Table 2.4:\na = 1,0181 - 0,001283\t(2.8)\nwhere T (temperature) is in \u00b0C, and 20 &lt;T &lt;800.\nTable 2.4 - Reduction factors for residual stresses\nTemp.

So, it is important to considerer this instability mode to determine the effective cross-section.\nOn local instability mode the effective section is determined by the effective width concept, where the reduction occurs on elements width, while the distortional instability\nmode is determined by the effective thickness concept, where the reduction occurs on elements thickness (Table 2.5) (CEN, 2006a).\nTable 2.5 - Effective cross-section for different types of instabilities\nType of\tType of instability\nelement\tLocal\tDistortional\nThe North American Specification for the design of cold-formed steel structures (AISI S100 2007) describes the method to obtain the cross-sections properties, and suggest, when applicable, the effective design widths to calculate those section properties, or the Direct Strength Method, presented on Appendix 1 from this standard, for some prequalified elements.\nAccording to the EC3, Part 1-3 (CEN, 2006a), local buckling effects are represented by effective cross-section properties, obtained by the effective width method, and for distortional buckling is suggested the calculation of reduced thickness of edge and intermediate elements from cross-section. Intermediate steps for determining crosssections properties are described on the EC3, Part 1-3 (CEN, 2006a), and Part 1-5 (CEN, 2006b).\nEffective width method is adopted by almost all standardization documents related to cold-formed steel structures (CEN, 2006a). Currently, the design of cold-formed steel elements for local buckling depends on the effective width approach. The direct application of this empirical method has been used since 1940, the inception of cold-formed steel design, and continues to be used in the design of full thin-walled structures. The mainly application of this method is for estimate the post-buckling resistance values, on plate post-buckling context.\nOn effective area method, the effective area is obtained directly from the critical bifurcation stress of all cross-sections. Thus, it is possible to solve some cases that are not covered by the effective width method, as accounting the influence of rotations bending restrictions, which occurs on longitudinal internal edges, and the direct application of this method on sections when the distortional instability mode occurs.\nActually, for different optimised cross-sections not presented on the Eurocode, the application of these two methods can become complicated. In some cases, the interaction between multiple buckling modes is difficult to determine the elastic buckling stress and the effective section properties.\nThe Direct Strength Method, suggested by Schafer and Pekoz (1998b), is applicable to complex cross-sections, avoiding the complexity of current methods, and makes the design process easier than the Eurocode rules. This method has been calibrated with AISI Standard, with a large number of experimental results, and was accepted by this standard as an alternative design for cold-formed steel elements (such as columns and beams). This method requires the elastic buckling elements behaviour, and then provides a series of nominal strength curves for predicting the elements strength based on elastic buckling behaviour.\n2.3.3\tApproximate numerical methods\nAs mentioned before, some instability problems can be founded on cold-formed steel elements under axial compression. Buckling problems (such as local, distortional, flexural buckling, flexural-torsional and local interaction, or local and global interaction) reduce the ultimate failure loads significantly. Therefore, approximate methods must be applied to eliminate the buckling problems or to delay it action.\nApproximate numerical methods available may be classified by two groups, according to their application, using equilibrium differential equations or the system potential energy. The second ones can only be applied in conservative problems. Some of these methods, relevant for this work, are very briefly presented below (Reis and Camotim, 2001; Simitses and Hodges, 2006): the Finite Element Method and the Finite Strip Method, as both were applied in this research work.\nGeneralized Beam Theory is an extension to conventional engineering beam theory that allows cross-section distortion to be considered, applied to equilibrium differential equations (bars only) and the displacements are \u201cpure deformation modes\u201d previously identified and chosen. However, within the scope of this study will not be applied.\n2.3.3.1\tFinite Element Method (FEM)\nThe FEM is applied to equilibrium differential equations and to the potential energy. It involves two discretization structural levels: structure division in finite elements, with simple geometry, generating a nodes mesh between the elements; and inside the finite element, the approximation of the displacement shape combining linear functions.\nThe FEM has been widely used in design of structures since the 60's. Engineers used the method for approximate solutions of problems in stress analysis, fluid flow, heat transfer, and other areas (Cook et al., 1989).\n\u201cThe finite element method is one of the most powerful numerical techniques ever devised for solving differential (and integral) equations of initial and boundary-value problems in geometrically complicated regions.\u201d (Reddy, 1984). It is a numerical procedure for analysing structures which are too complicated to be solved applying a classical analytical method. The results are approximated, but errors are decreased by processing more equations.\nOn FEM the structure is divided into a finite number of small and simple elements, then reconnected with nodes, and this process results in a set of simultaneous algebraic equations. The advantage of dividing a big element into small ones is that it allows to the small element simple shape (different between them), which leads to a good approximation for the analysis. Another advantage is that at every node occurs an interpolation polynomial. The Figure 2.31 shows a problem that illustrates de\ndiscretization process of cold-formed profile used in real life practical solutions, with the finite element concept.\nFigure 2.31 \u2014 a) Madremax and b) a possible finite element model (Lopes et al., 2016)\nSAFIR (Franssen, 2005) is a software developed at the University of Liege in Belgium that applies the finite element method (FEM) for geometric and material non-linear analysis. Being especially developed for the study of structures under fire situations, it has been applied in several research studies, as an example in studies on the evaluation of local buckling at elevated temperatures including validation with experimental tests(Couto et al., 2015), or numerical comparisons with other software (Prachar et al., 2014). Due to its characteristics, this software is applied on the FEM analysis of the current research work.\n2.3.3.2\tFinite Strip Method (FSM)\nThe FSM is a modification of the FEM, adapted to structures with a regular geometric configuration and simple boundary conditions and load applications. The geometry is always the same along the longitudinal axis (Figure 2.32 b)).\nFigure 2.32 \u2014 Element discretization in a) finite elements and b) finite strips (Schafer and Adany, 2006)\nThe finite strip method was first introduced by Cheung (1968) and is less powerful and versatile than the finite element method, but more efficient for the computational modelling of some cases. This method is semi-numerical and semi-analytical, and it is suitable for the following types of civil engineering structures such as bridge slabs, box girders, roofs consisting of plane elements. Basically, the FSM reduces a twodimensional problem to a one-dimensional problem.\nOn Finite Strip Method the element suffers discretization, only in the cross-section plane, being divided into finite strips, all of them with the same length (of the bar) and connected by \u201cnodal lines\u201d and approximation by polynomials on longitudinal direction. This method is particularly better to perform the stability analysis of structures with a precise or approximated periodical variation of displacements configuration on longitudinal direction.\nThe CUFSM software (Schafer and Adany, 2006) was developed to analyse the elastic buckling behaviour. It generates the critical elastic buckling modes and the thin-walled members deformation, originally created to research the behaviour of cold-formed steel members under uniform longitudinal stresses (such as axial, bending, warping torsion, or their combination). CUFSM is most commonly used for thin-walled cold-formed steel members and apply the semi-analytical finite strip method (FSM) to provide solutions for the cross-section of these members. To complement the research work performed in this thesis, this software is also here applied.\nEurocode 3 prescriptions for cold-formed steel members\n3\tEurocode 3 prescriptions for cold-formed\nSTEEL MEMBERS\n3.1\tGeneral considerations\n3.2\tSteel mechanical characteristics of cold-formed sections\n3.3\tDesign rules at high temperatures\n3.3.1\tClassification of cross-sections\n3.3.2\tEffective cross-sectional properties\n3.3.2.1\tLocal instability\n3.3.2.2\tDistortional instability\n3.3.3\tResistance of cross-section and members\n3.3.3.1\tAxially compressed members\n3.3.3.2\tBending moment members\n3.3.3.3\tCombined bending and axial compression\n3\tEurocode 3 prescriptions for cold-formed\nsteel MEMBERS\n3.1\tGeneral considerations\nAccording to EC3, the analysis and design of cold-formed steel structures contain some differences from hot-rolled steel structures.\nThe EC3, Part 1-3 (CEN, 2006a), provides design requirements for cold-formed thin elements and sheeting. These rules are applied to cold-formed steel products made from coated or uncoated thin gauge hot/cold-rolled sheet cold-formed by such processes as cold-rolling or press-braking (Dubina et al., 2012). The EN 1090 covers the execution of cold-formed steel structures, and the calculation rules given in this standard are only valid if the cold-formed members manufacturing tolerances fulfil the EN 1090-2 (CEN, 2008) limits, to ensure adequate levels of mechanical resistance as well as stability, serviceability and durability levels.\nThe French National Annex (FN Annex) of the EC3, Part 1-2 (CEN, 2007), proposes the use of different design formulae and steel constitutive law for cold-formed profiles at elevated temperatures, which will be analysed and applied in this study.\n3.2\tsteel mechanical characteristics of cold-formed sections\nMaterial properties have an important role in the structural members behaviour. Therefore, it is important to be familiar with the mechanical properties of the steel sheets, strip and plates of cold-formed steel elements before designing it.\nAccording to Part 1-1 of EC3 (CEN, 2005a), for the structural steels covered by this Eurocode Part, the material coefficients to be adopted in calculations should be taken as follow:\n\u2022\tElasticity modulus: E = 210 000 MPa (N/mm2);\n\u2022\tShear modulus: G = \u2014-\u2014 ~ 81 000 MPa (N/mm2);\n\u2022\tPoisson's ration in elastic stage: v = 0,30.\nPartial factors yMi for buildings may be defined in the National Annex.\nOther important properties depending on the steel grade and manufacturing process are: basic yield strength (fyb), average yield strength (fya) and ultimate tensile strength (f?).\nOn Part 1-3 of EC3 (CEN, 2006a) the design cold-formed members and profiled sheets fabricated from steel material must be conform the different types of steel standards and steel grades, and the respective nominal values of basic yield strength and ultimate tensile strength, listed on the same document in Table 3.1a and Table 3.1b.\nIn general, cold forming leads to a modification of the steel stress-strain curve.\nCold rolling provides an increase of the yield strength and sometimes of the ultimate strength, which revealed to be important in the corners and still being significant in the flanges (Table 3.1). This influence does not occur in hot-rolled cross-sections.\nTable 3.1 - Influence of manufacturing process on the basic strengths of cold-formed profiles (ASRO, 2008)\nCold forming\nForming method\t-----------------------\n\t\tCold rolling\tPress braking\nYield strength (fy)\tCorner\tHigh\tHigh\n\tFlange\tModerate\t-\nUltimate strength (fu)\tCorner\tHigh\tHigh\n\tFlange\tModerate\t-\nOn one hand, the basic yield strength increase is due to strain hardening (especially due to corners folding) and depends on the type of steel used on cold rolling process. On the other hand, the ultimate strength increase is related to strain aging, accompanied with the ductility decrease, which depends on the metallurgical properties of the material. Therefore, it is common to take advantage of the steel hardening on steel elements design and apply the average yield strength (fya), whose value is higher than the basic yield strength (fyb).\nAccording to Part 1-3 of EC3 (CEN, 2006a) the increased yield strength due to cold forming may be taken into account in axially loaded members whose effective crosssection area (Aeyy) equals the gross area (Ag), or in determining Ae?f the yield strength (fy) should be taken as the basic yield strength (fyb).\nThe average value of yield stress increases with the number of bends, and may be determined from the results of full size tests or by calculation using Eq. (3.1):\n(7\u00bb + fyb)\n2\n(3.1)\nwhere,\n\u2022\tAg is the gross cross-sectional area;\n\u2022\tk is the numerical coefficient that depends on the type of forming (k = 7 for roll forming and k = 5 for other methods of forming);\n\u2022\tn is the number of 90\u00b0 bends in the cross-section with an internal radius l &lt;5) (fractions of 90\u00b0 bends should be counted as fractions of n)\n\u2022\t) is the design core thickness of the steel material before cold-forming.\nWhen the probability of occurrence of local instability phenomenon is low (crosssection profiles with Class 1, 2 or 3), it is possible to apply the average yield strength (fya) on tensile zones instead of the basic yield strength (fyb). In the cold-formed steel elements production is very common to use galvanized steel with yield strength (fy) with values between 200 and 600 N/mm2 and with ultimate strength (f?) in the range of 300 to 750 N/mm2.\nTo determine the resistance capacity of a steel structure is important to consider the instability phenomena. The high steel resistance often leads to design slender structures, where the global behaviour is extremely affected by the instability modes.\nThe stress-strain diagram which describes the material behaviour is known as \u201celasticplastic\u201d and characterized by (Reis and Camotim, 2001):\n\u2022\tAn elastic range/region (initial elastic domain): reversible on an initial domain with linear development (slope corresponding to the elasticity mode, E);\n\u2022\tA plastic range/region (plastic domain): irreversible, where a discharge of the material, after an elastic domain, occurs in parallel with the elastic linear development and generates permanent deformations, often with a non-linear development (variable ET value).\nThe Figure 3.1 shows part of the stress-strain diagram for structural steel for modelling the material behaviour.\nUpper Yield Point\nSlope = E j\nI\nLower Yield Point E,\nStrain-Hardening Range\n/ Plastic Range\n!-----------\u2014\u2014----------\u25ba\u00ab<-\n___________________Inelastic Range_________________________\n____ Elastic Range\n____ Slope = E\n------L\u2014L-------1-----------1----------1-----------1---------\u25ba\n0.005\t0.010\t0.015\t0.020\t0.025\t0.030\n0.002\tStrain\nFigure 3.1 - Partial stress-strain curve for structural steel (Brockenbrough and Johnston, 1968)\nCold-formed mechanical properties can suffer several changes when the steel element is under fire conditions. Apply the temperature uniform throughout the cross-section is possible due to the high thermal steel conductivity and its reduced thickness. To consider this mechanical resistance and stiffness loss, it is necessary to apply the reduction factor of Young's modulus and the reduction factor of yield strength according to the applied temperature (CEN, 2005b).\nAccording to Part 1-2 of EC3 (CEN, 2005b), Annex E (Class 4 cross-sections), for the design under fire conditions, the yield strength of steel should be taken as the 0,2% proof strength (used to determine the resistance to tension, compression, moment or shear). For the other cross-section classes, the yield strength of steel to apply corresponds to the stress at 2% total strain (Figure 3.2).\nFigure 3.2 - Stress-strain relationship for carbon steel at elevated temperatures (CEN, 2005b)\n/y,e\teffective yield strength;\n/p,0\tproportional limit;\n#a,0\tslope of the linear elastic range;\n\u00bfp,0\tstrain at the proportional limit;\n\u00bfy,0\tyield strain;\n\u00bft,0\tlimiting strain for yield strength;\n\u00a3u,0\tultimate strain.\n8 u.e Strain 8\nAccording to EC3, thin-walled cross-sections are classified as Class 4 (CEN, 2005a).\nFor these cross-sections, Part 1-2 of EC3 (CEN, 2005b) states that the conventional\nlimit of proportionality at 0.2%, fo.2,p,o, should be used instead of the yield strength for a total strain of 2%, fyo, as proposed for stocky.\nThe FN Annex of Part 1-2 of EC3 (CEN, 2007) proposes a different design approach for thin-walled cross-sections and different reduction factors for the steel constitutive laws at elevated temperatures for cold-formed profiles (Zhao et al., 2005). These new material laws are obtained from different reduction factors for the yield strength and Young\u2019s modulus at high temperatures. The FN Annex proposes lower values for these reduction factors for cold-formed profiles. The comparison of the different constitutive laws between the Annex E and the FN Annex from Part 1-2 of EC3 is presented in Figure 3.3.\n(5 (MPa)\n400 t.....T-\n----350\u00b0 (Annex E)\n----35 OP (FN Annex)\n----500P (Annex E)\n500\u00b0 (FN Annex)\n----600\u00b0 (Annex E)\n60 CP (FN Annex)\n\u00a3\n20\n350\n0.12 0.\n300 j\n250 f 7\n14\n0.16\n0.18\n0.\n0 d\u2014\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.10\n100\nFigure 3.3 - Constitutive law for elevated temperatures according to EC3\n3.3\tDesign rules at high temperatures\nDesign in case of fire is mainly concerned with preventing the structural collapse before the specified fire resistance period. During a fire, large deformations are accepted and normally they do not need to be calculated, as usual at normal temperature design (Buchanan, 2001; Franssen and Vila Real, 2010). According to Part 1-2 of EC3 (CEN, 2005b) the model of the structural system should reflect the expected performance of the structure in fire verifying that, during a relevant duration of fire exposure t:\nEfi,d \u2014 2fi,d,t\t(3.2)\nwhere, Ej-ld is the design effect of actions for the fire situation and Rfid,t is the corresponding design resistance of the member in the fire situation at time t.\n3.3.1\tClassification of cross-sections\nSteel structural cross-sections may be considered as an assembly of individual plate elements divided into two different types: internal elements and outstand elements (Figure 3.4).\nFigure 3.4 - Internal and outstand elements\nDue to the reduced thickness plate elements in structural sections, compared with their width, when loaded in compression (result of axial compression or bending) local buckling may occur in these elements.\nThe EC3 defines four cross-section classes in order to identify the extent to which the resistance and rotation capacity of cross-sections is limited by its local buckling resistance (CEN, 2005a).\nThin-walled cold-formed steel elements usually have a cross-section classification equivalent to sections of Class 4 or, at most, Class 3. Compared to hot-rolled crosssections (frequently of Class 1 or 2), only the elastic analysis is taken into account, because cold-formed steel elements are characterized by a reduced post-elastic strength and by a reduced ductility (i.e. without a sufficient plastic rotation capacity to form plastic hinges).\nClass 4 cross-sections may be replaced by an effective Class 3 cross-section (Franssen and Vila Real, 2010). The obtained cross-section only takes into account the gross section without the parts where the local buckling effect can occur (Figure 3.5).\nGross cross-section\nFigure 3.5 - Effective cross-section\n3.3.2\tEffective cross-sectional properties\nThe design of cold-formed steel elements is based on the method of the effective crosssection, considering the cross-sectional resistance reduction due to local instability, which reduces the length of each part of the cross-section as referred before. However, the existence of stiffeners on cross-section elements leads to the occurrence of distortional instability effects.\nTherefore, it is necessary to take into account the instability mode to obtain the effective cross-section. According to the Part 1-3 of EC3 (CEN, 2006a):\n\u2022\tlocal and distortional buckling effects should be considered to determining the resistance and stiffness of cold-formed members and sheeting;\n\u2022\tto consider the local buckling effects, it may be used the effective crosssectional properties calculated with the method of the effective width;\n\u2022\tin determining local buckling resistance, the yield strength (<@) should be taken as the basic yield strength (fyb);\n\u2022\tdistortional buckling shall be taken into account where it constitutes a critical failure mode;\n\u2022\tto consider the distortional buckling effects, it may be used the effective crosssectional properties calculated with the reduced thickness method.\n3.3.2.1\tLocal instability (Method of the Effective Width)\nAs mentioned before, according to the Part 1-3 of EC3 (CEN, 2006a) the local buckling effects are taken into account with effective cross-sectional properties obtained with the Method of the Effective Width (Figure 3.6).\na) Simple bending\n-I L .\nb) Axial compression\nFigure 3.6 - Effective cross section with the Method of Effective Width\nThe stress distribution is characterized by low stress values on central part and maximum stress values on longitudinal edges. Von Karman et al. (1932) introduced the \u201ceffective width\u201d concept (Figure 3.7). Instead of considering the \u201cnon-linear\u201d stress distribution ax(y), over the entire width of the plate b, it is assumed that the total load, P, is carried by a fictitious effective width, beff, subjected to a uniformly distributed stress equal to the longitudinal edge stress value, \\max (Figure 3.8).\nFigure 3.7 - Concept of effective length\nFigure 3.8 - Stress distribution in simply supported plate, uniaxially compressed\nThe beff value presented on Figure 3.7 and Figure 3.8 is obtained by Eq. 3.6.\nbeff -\ni=\\x(y)dy\n(3.6)\nb\nThus, the reduction factor for the plate buckling resistance p is obtained by:\np = \\E=6\u00a3f\u00a3\t(3.7)\n\\e\tb\nThe effective widths of compression elements should be obtained from Part 1-5 of EC3 (CEN, 2006b) on Table 4.1 for internal elements and Table 4.2 for outstand elements (tables of the respective document).\nThe reduction factor p for internal elements under compression is calculated by:\np = 1\tfor X. &lt;0.5 + y0.085 - 0.055a\nX. - 0.055(3 + a)\t-\t,______________ (3.8)\nP =--------\u2014---------&lt;1\tfor X. > 0.5 + y0.085 - 0.055^\nX.\nand for outstand elements under compression is calculated by:\nP = 1\nX. - 0.188\n---<1\nX.\nfor X. &lt;0.748\nfor X. > 0.748\n(3.9)\nwhere a is the stress ratio and X. the plate slenderness given by:\nX\t(3.10)\nP\t28 As Jk~a\nand kF is the buckling factor, corresponding to the stress ratio a and boundary\nconditions (see Table 4.1 and Table 4.2 from Part 1-5 of EC3).\nCalculated the effective width, be//, of each cross-section element, it is possible to determine the new position of the centroidal axis of effective cross-section and calculate the respective properties.\n3.3.2.2\tDistortional instability (Method of the Reduced Thickness)\nFor distortional instability, the Part 1-3 of EC3 (CEN, 2006a) does not provide explicit provisions. However, it is possible to obtain a calculation procedure for plane elements with edge or intermediate stiffeners in compression by applying the Method of the Redyced Thickness (Figure 3.9).\n\u00a3 r\nL\nb\nk----H\na) Simple bending\n^eff/2\t^eff/2\nb) Compression\nFigure 3.9 - Effective cross section with the Method of Reduced Thickness\nFor compression elements with edge or intermediate stiffeners, the design is based on the assumption that the stiffness behaves as a compression member with a partial restriction, an equivalent spring stiffness (#), that depends on the boundary conditions and on the flexural stiffness of the adjacent plane elements of the cross-section.\nTo obtain the spring stiffness of the stiffener, a unit load per unit length (u) is applied on the cross-section stiffener (Figure 3.10).\nFigure 3.10 - Determination of the spring stiffness (K) and the respective deflection (<) for C and Z sections according to the Part 1-3 of EC3 (CEN, 2006a)\nThe general equation that expresses the spring stiffness per unit length is:\nu\n(3.11)\nwhere V is the deflection of the stiffener due to the unit load u and should be obtained\nfrom:\nV \u2014 Sb. +\nubp312(1 \u2014 v2)\n3 Et3\n(3.12)\nwith,\nubp\nCo\n(3.13)\n\nFor an edge stiffener, the elastic critical buckling stress is:\n24kETs\nAs\n(3.14)\nIn case of lipped C or Z sections, as presented on Figure 3.10, the spring stiffness for\nthe flange, #, is obtained from:\nEt3\t1\n# =\t-----^\u201c2----------3----------------- (3.15)\n4(1- v2)b12hw + b\u00b13 + 0.56b2hwkf\nwith,\n\u2022\tb7 and b8, the distance from the web to the centre of the effective area of the\nstiffener in compression of flange 1 and 2 respectively;\n\u2022\thw the web depth;\n\u2022\tkf = 0 for bending about y-y axis;\n= Aeff2 for a member in axial compression;\nAeffl\nkf = 1 for a symmetric section in compression;\n\u2022\tIs the effective second moment of area of the stiffener;\n\u2022\tAs the effective area of the edge stiffener considered;\n\u2022\tAeff7 and Aeff2 the effective area of the edge stiffener of flange 1 and 2\nrespectively.\nAccording to the Part 1-3 of EC3 (CEN, 2006a), in case of a plane element with an edge and intermediate stiffener(s), in the absence of a more accurate method, the effect of the intermediate stiffener(s) may be neglected.\nThe thickness reduction factor _d for the distortional buckling resistance of the edge stiffener should be obtained from the relative slenderness:\nwhere,\nif Xd &lt;0.65\nXd = 1.47 - 0.723Xd\nXd = 0.66/Xd\nif 0.65 &lt;Xd &lt;1.38\nif Xd > 1.38\n(3.16)\nI fy&amp;\n-J \\cr,i\n(3.17)\nIt is recommended the achievement of two iterations of all the local and distortional instability process with:\nXp,red\tXpyXd\nObtained the thickness reduction factor, _d, the thickness reduction is:\n^red\t^Xd&lt;\n(3.18)\n(3.19)\nCalculated the thickness reduction, tred, of cross-section stiffener, it is possible to determine the new position of the centroidal axis of effective cross-section and calculate the cross-section properties.\n3.3.3\tResistance of cross-section and members\nThe design values of internal forces and moments of a cross-section should not exceed the design values of the corresponding resistances from EC3.\nFor the design, the local buckling effects shall be taken into account by using the effective cross-section properties. Also, the distortional buckling effects shall be taken into account considering the possibility of lateral buckling occurrence.\nThe Part 1-3 of EC3 (CEN, 2006a) only gives design guidelines for cold-formed steel members at normal temperature. The design method given in Part 1-2 of EC3 (CEN, 2005b) can be used for cold-formed steel members. Therefore, the design values are going to be compared with the fire resistance conditions presented on Part 1-2 of EC3 (CEN, 2005b) for Class 3 or 4 cross-sections (cold-formed steel members case).\nCross-section verification is not specifically mentioned in the Part 1-2 of EC3. However, there is as clause which mentions that the formulae from Part 1-1 of EC3 could be used if adapted to high temperatures.\n3.3.3.1\tAxially compressed members\nThe design value of the compression force in the fire situation, NfiEd, at each cross-\nsection should satisfy the following condition:\n\u00b0fi,Ed\n\u00b0b,fi,t,Rd\nAccording to the Part 1-2 of EC3 (CEN, 2005b) the design buckling resistance,\nOb,fi,t,Rd, at required time t of a compression member with a uniform temperature 0\nshould be determined from:\n\u00b0b,fi,t,Rd\n_\tfy\nXmin,fi^Cy,0\nYM,fi\n(3.21)\nwhere,\n\u2022\tA is the cross-section area (A = Aeff, the effective cross-section area for Class 4 cross-section);\n\u2022\tky 0 is the reduction factor for the yield strength of steel at uniform temperature 0, reached at time t (ky0 = k0.2tPte, the reduction factor for the 0.2% proof strength for Class 4 cross-section);\n\u2022\tXminji is the reduction factor for flexural buckling in the fire design situation defined as the lower of the values of xy,fi and Xz.fi and determined according to:\nXfi _------.1\t&lt;1-0\nI 2 \u2014 8 $0 +\t\u2014 X0\n(3.22)\nThe non-dimensional slenderness X0 for the temperature 0, is given by:\nX0\n(3.23)\nwhere kE0 is the reduction factor for the Young's modulus.\nFor the remaining parameters, the FN Annex proposes a design procedure similar to\nPart 1-2 of EC3, with particular differences (Table 3.2).\nTable 3.2 - Differences between Part 1-2 of EC3 (CEN, 2005b) and FN Annex from Part 1-2 of EC3 (CEN, 2007) for axial compression members design\nPart 1-2 of EC3 + Annex E\tPart 1-2 of EC3 + FN Annex\n1 r\t-\t- 21 - 21.1 + aXe + Xe J\t1 r\t-\t-2i&lt;Pe = 211 + a(Xe \u2014 0'2) + Xe ]\n235 a = 0.65 \u2014\u2014 Jfy\ta (curve from Table 6.3, section 6.2.3 of Part 1-3 of EC3, for different types of cross-section)\nkyqtpqko,2,PqkEq (values from Table 3^ Part 1-2 of EC3, and Table E.1 of Annex E)\tk k k\tk (values from Table AN6.1 of Ay.^vp,q-r'0,2,pq^-E.e v FN Annex)\nFor members with non-symmetric Class 4 cross-sections, the additional moment, \u2022MEd, should be taken into account due to the eccentricity of the centroidal axis of effective cross-section, considering the axial compression and bending moment interaction.\n3.3.3.2\tBending moment members\nThe design value of the bending action in the fire situation, MfiEd, at each cross-section should satisfy the following condition:\nMfi,Ed\nMb,fi,3,Rd\nAccording to the Part 1-2 of EC3 (CEN, 2005b) the design lateral-torsional buckling resistance moment, Mbfi t Rd, at required time t for a laterally unrestrained beam with a uniform temperature 0 should be determined from:\nfy\nMb,fi,t,Rd\tXLT,fiWyky,e,com\t(3.25)\nYM.fi\nwhere,\n\u2022\tWy is the elastic section modulus, Wely, for Class 3 cross-section and the effective section modulus, Weffy, for Class 4 cross-section;\n\u2022\tky,e,com is the reduction factor for the yield strength of steel at the maximum temperature in the compression flange 0, at time t (kye = k0.2tPte, the reduction factor for the 0.2% proof strength for Class 4 cross-section);\n\u2022\t_LT,fi is the reduction factor for lateral-torsional buckling in the fire design situation determined according to:\nXLT.fi \u2014\tI-------------------------\n0ET,0,com + ' 0ET,0,com\tXLI,0,cr;m\n1\n(3.26)\nThe non-dimensional slenderness for lateral-torsional buckling XHI,0,com at the maximum temperature in the compression flange 0, is given by:\n1\nXLI,0,cr;m\nCy,0,com\nCE,0,com\n(3.27)\n\u2014 XET\nFor the remaining parameters, the FN Annex proposes a design procedure similar to\nPart 1-2 of EC3, with particular differences (Table 3.3).\nTable 3.3 - Differences between Part 1-2 of EC3 (CEN, 2005b) and FN Annex from Part 1-2 of EC3 (CEN, 2007) for bending moment members design\nPart 1-2 of EC3 + Annex E\tPart 1-2 of EC3 + FN Annex\n1 r\t-\t-\t2-1 0LT,0,com = 2 L1 +\t+ XLT,0,com \u201d\t1 r\t-\t-\t2-| 0LT,e,com = 2 L1 +\t\u2014 0,2) + VrAcom j\na = 0,65 f235 V,\taHI = 0,34 (value from Table 6.1, section 6.3.2.2 of Part 1-1 of EC3, lateral buckling curve b)\nk k k\tk (values from Table 3.1 Part 1-2 of EC3, and Table E.1 of Annex E)\tk k k\tk (values from Table AN6.1 of FN n\u2019y.e^-p.^io,2,p,^iE,e v Annex)\n3.3.3.3\tCombined bending and axial compression\nFor Class 3 and 4 cross-sections the maximum longitudinal stress obtained with an elastic analysis and based on the gross area of Class 3 cross-sections or the effective area of Class 4 cross-sections should verify the following conditions (Franssen and Vila Real, 2010):\n/fi,Ed + %y,fi,Ed\t%z,fi,Ed &lt;Cy,0<y\n4z\tTw,fi\n_\t\u2014 0fi,Ed\n\\],fi,Fd \u2014\t+ \u2014\n(3.28)\nThe Eq.

In some cases, the cross-section capacity is lower than the overall stability, especially for members subjected to end moments with double curvature (^ = \u20141), where the maximum moment point is located at the end of the element and not influence the member stability. For members subjected to uniform moment (^ = 1) the overall buckling verified with Eq. (3.30) and Eq. (3.31) will always be more severe than the cross-section verification.\nFor not doubly symmetrical cross-sections, the axial load will be eccentrically when considering the effective cross-section.

However, due to the high costs associated to experimental tests the parametrization of the profiles behaviour has been carried out through numerical studies validated.\nSimply supported beams, columns and beam-columns are the focused elements analysed in this research work. The most elementary and common cases are selected and here explored due to the extensive different possible cases to choose and study. Beam's analysed cases are the laterally unrestrained members under bending moment around the y-y axis (strong axis), where the lateral torsional buckling can occur. For columns, the considered case is under axial compression and taken into account the buckling around the minor axis (z-z axis due to the cross-sections type analysed in the following chapters - C and S). About beam-columns, the most common case analysed is N+My (with and without lateral torsional buckling). N+Mz is not a situation easy to occur to this kind of analysed cross-sections. Otherwise, it would be necessary to take into account the two-ways of Mz (Mz+ and Mz-).\nThis chapter presents the validation of the applied numerical models in this work against different experimental works performed by different authors, analysing different parameters that can be important on the numerical models conception, such as restrictions, loads distribution and FEM elements and respective mesh. Table 4.1 shows the different numerically modelled experimental tests, which were important for the validation of numerical models.\nTable 4.1 - List of analysed experimental tests\nTemperature\tElement type\tCross-section\tReference\nNormal Temperature \u25a0\tColumns Beam-columns\tS\tAghoury et al.

The numerical analysis of cold-formed steel elements of this research work is obtained using the software SAFIR.\nLocal, distortional and global instability modes obtained in CAST3M (CAST3M, 2012) were used to define the geometrical imperfection shapes by applying the interface with SAFIR, RUBY (developed at the University of Aveiro, in Portugal) (Couto et al., 2013), comparing with the results obtained with CUFSM software.\nResidual stresses are not considered on the numerical models due to the lack of information provided by the authors.\n4.2\tNormal temperature\nExperimental tests at normal temperature were modelled due to the lack of experimental tests research on cold-formed steel elements at high temperatures, particularly on beamcolumn's elements. Some of those elements were also adopted for the numerical parametric analysis. Experimental tests with lipped-channel and sigma cross-sections elements are presented and corresponding numerical analysis are performed.\n4.2.1\tColumns\nTo investigate the effect of initial geometric imperfections and residual stresses on single lipped sigma columns, Aghoury et al. (2014) analysed and tested eight specimens (see test setup on Figure 4.1). The simply supported lipped sigma columns E_240x60x20x(1.5), paper reference S-60-75, was considered with the length of 1036 mm. The cross-section rotation at the ends is not allowed and the axial load is distributed around the cross-section on the bottom. Residual stresses were neglected and the geometric imperfections were applied according to the authors considerations. Also the geometric imperfections amplitudes from EN1090-2 (CEN, 2008) were tested and compared with the previous values (Table4.2). Initial geometric imperfections were taken into account in the numerical model and their influence evaluated. The values correspond to 80% of geometric fabrication tolerances, following the recommendations from Annex C of Part 1-5 of EC3, and described in section D.1 from Annex D of EN 1090-2+A1.\nTable 4.2 - Geometric imperfections magnitudes analysed\nReference\tGeometric imperfections magnitudes considered\t\t\n\tLocal\tDistortional\tGlobal\nAghoury et al.

Figure 4.3 shows the numerical model and the corresponded\ndeformed shape at the collapse instant, with the distortional buckling phenomenon occurrence as occurred at the experimental test (Aghoury et al., 2014).\nFigure 4.2 - Sigma load-displacement chart (experimental and numerical)\na) Model\tb) Deformed shape\nFigure 4.3 - Sigma numerical model before and after the SAFIR analysis\nThe numerical models considering the initial imperfections are closer to the numerical results and at the same time are on the safe side. From this analysis, it is possible to\nconclude that it is important to consider the initial geometric imperfections on the numerical models to the numerical analysis.\nThe following research work (Young and Rasmussen, 1998) presents a group of cold-formed steel plain and lipped-channel columns tests under compression action and the strengths compared with the design strengths from determined specifications (Australian, American 1996 specifications).

Figure 4.5 and Figure 4.6 also present the load-deflection and load-shortening charts experimental and numerically obtained for the 565 mm length model.\nTable 4.4 - Experimental vs. Numerical results at normal temperature\nLength [mm]\tUltimate load [kN]\t\tDifference [%]\n\tExperimental\tNumerical\t\n300\t100.1\t98.1\t2.0\n565\t87.6\t91.4\t4.3\n1065\t72.0\t70.6\t1.9\n1565\t53.2\t52.3\t1.7\nFrom Figure 4.5, Figure 4.6 and Table 4.4 results is possible to observe differences lower than 5%, where is visible a good numerical validation of the numerical model when compared to the experimental lipped-channel columns at normal temperature.

(2015) presents the structural strength and stability of cold-formed steel lipped-channel beam-columns tests under bending and compression action. Figure 4.8 presents the test setup and an experimental case of the research work.\nFrom de different cases of this research work, C_154x35x11x(1.5) with 305, 610 and 1219 mm length, under major axis bending with an eccentric loading, were considered. For the numerical analysis, residual stresses were neglected and the geometric imperfections taking into account according to CEN (2008) amplitudes to be on the safe side, since no related information was provided by the authors. The results from experimental and numerical analysis, for the different lengths, are presented in Table\n4.5.\nTable 4.5 - Experimental vs. Numerical results for C_154x35x11x(1.5)\nLength\tAxial Force\t\tDifferences\n\tExperimental\tNumerical\t\n305 mm\t20.55 kN\t23.81 kN\t15.9 %\n610 mm\t21.51 kN\t24.36 kN\t13.2 %\n1219 mm\t23.41 kN\t25.57 kN\t9.2 %\nFigure 4.8 - Test setup of beam-column experimental test (Torabian et al., 2015)\nBottom Loading plate Bottom Swivel Joint\t\u25a0 \u2022 \u2022\nPT1 PT3<B*ck|\tPT2 PT4<B|\nTop joint\nGTranfiR\nBottom joint\nTest data visualization\nFigure 4.9 and Figure 4.10 present the load-displacement chart for the lipped-channel beam-column with 1219 mm length, with the experimental and the numerical analysis, as well as the deformed shape of the element after the analysis.\nLoad [kN]\nDisplacement [mm]\nFigure 4.9 - Experimental and numerical C-section load-displacement chart\nb) Experimental test (Torabian et al., 2015)\nFigure 4.10 - Numerical and experimental lipped-channel beam-column deformation\nAs it is possible to observe, there is a good agreement between SAFIR results and the experimental test (results and collapse mode/shape). For beam-columns, where the test data is more complex than the test data for beams or columns, the differences on the results are notorious (from 4.3% to 15.9%). Despite this, the results remain very reasonable.\n4.3\tElevated temperatures\nRecently this type of research has been increasing but there is a small number of elevated temperature tests on cold-formed profiles. Some of the elements analysed in the present chapter were also adopted for the numerical parametric analysis. Experimental tests with zed, sigma and lipped-channel cross-sections elements are presented with some analyses and brief conclusions.\nThe elevated temperatures were considered uniform throughout the cross-section due to the reduced thickness of the cross-section\u2019s walls.\n4.3.1\tColumns\nThe first elevated temperatures research work here analysed (Mesquita et al., 2014) presents an experimental study about cold-formed steel C and Z cross-section columns\nbehaviour at normal and high temperatures and compared with the ones obtained with the Eurocode simplified models.\nFrom de different cases analysed by Mesquita et al. (2014), the lipped-channel element C_150x51x20x(1.5), reference C17 under ISO834 fire curve and 1000 mm length, was considered. For the numerical analysis, residual stresses were neglected and the geometric imperfections taking into account the CEN (2008) amplitudes, since nothing was mentioned by the authors.\nFigure 4.11 presents the fire resistance furnace used for the experimental tests, as well as the applied fire test setup.\nFigure 4.11 - Furnace and experimental test setup (Mesquita et al., 2014)\nThe procedure of the fire test starts with the mechanical load application, representing a degree of use, increasing the load until the expected value and kept constant during the fire action. After, the temperature is applied according to the ISO834 fire curve.\nThe same procedure was applied on the numerical model with the experimental test data and the FN Annex constitutive law was used. The result from both analyses, experimental and numerical, are presented on Table 4.6 and in Figure 4.12.\nTable 4.6 - Experimental vs. Numerical results for C_150x51x20x(1.5)\n\tExperimental\tNumerical\tDifference\nResistance\t319 s\t277 s\t12.9%\nTime\t5 min\t4.6 min\t\nTemperature\t484 \u00b0C\t429 \u00b0C\t11.4%\nFigure 4.12 - Shortening-time chart experimental and numerically obtained for the\nC_150x51x20x(1.5) model\nFigure 4.13 also shows the numerical model and the respective deformed shape at the\ncollapse instance.\na) Model\tb) Deformed shape\nFigure 4.13 - C-section numerical column before and after the SAFIR analysis at high temperatures\nThe time and temperature values correspond to the values obtained since the furnace was switched on, until the collapse occurrence. From Table 4.6 and in Figure 4.12 is possible to observe differences of almost 13%, which is still a good validation of the numerical model against experimental lipped-channel columns at elevated temperature providing also reasonable similar behaviour during the fire test. Beams\nLaim et al. (2016) presented the results of an experimental study about cold-formed steel beams with different cross-section under fire conditions.\nFrom de different cases of this research work, C_250x43x15x(2.5), reference B-C, and E_255x70x25x(2.5), reference B-S, with 3000 mm length were considered. For the numerical analysis, residual stresses were neglected and the geometric imperfections taking into account according to CEN (2008) amplitudes, since no related information was provided by the authors. The fire curve applied during the numerical analysis was the one with the temperatures obtained for each element during the real fire test. Also, the FN Annex constitutive law was used in the present analysis.\nFigure 4.14 presents the applied test setup by Laim et al. (2016) research. The test was performed in two stages: first loading and then heating. The maximum load applied was 50% of the design value of the load-bearing capacity of the element at normal temperature. Reached the required load, the element was subjected to the ISO 834 fire curve, maintaining the load constant during the entire fire test.\nFigure 4.14 - Beam test setup (Laim et al., 2016)\nThe results from both analyses, experimental and numerical, and for the different models, are presented in Table 4.7.\nTable 4.7 - Experimental vs. Numerical results for high temperatures\nSection type\tOcr\t\tDifferences\n\tExperimental\tNumerical\t\nC_250x43x15x(2.5)\t718 \u00b0C\t709 \u00b0C\t1.3 %\nL_255x70x25x(2.5)\t681 \u00b0C\t686 \u00b0C\t0.8 %\nFigure 4.15 and Figure 4.16 present the displacement-time chart for lipped channel and sigma cross-sections, respectively, with the experimental and the numerical analysis.\nFigure 4.15 - C-section displacement-time chart (experimental and numerical) at high temperatures\nFigure 4.16 - Sigma section displacement-time chart (experimental and numerical) at high temperatures\nFrom Table 4.7, Figure 4.15 and Figure 4.16 is possible to observe a good agreement between both analysis with differences less than 2%, being a good numerical validation of the experimental beams at elevated temperature, with similar element behaviour during the fire test as shown in Figure 4.17 and Figure 4.18.\na) SAFIR result\tb) Experimental test (Laim et al., 2016)\nFigure 4.17 - Numerical and experimental C-beam after the analysis and the test\na) SAFIR result\nb) Experimental test (La\u00edm et al., 2016)\nFigure 4.18 - Numerical and experimental \u00a3-beam after the analysis and the test\nIt is possible to create a numerical model with the same characteristics and conditions of a fire experimental test and presenting similar results and behaviours. For being more stable, the sigma element fire test demonstrated to be in a better agreement with the numerical results and behaviour (Figure 4.15 and 4.16 and Table 4.7).\nFinally, the last experimental test studied presents cold-formed Z purlins, performed in the Fire testing laboratory PAVUS by the Czech Technical University in Prague, in a\nhorizontal furnace. The Z purlin is here analysed as it was possible to study in detail the data considered obtained from this test, performed in Prague, where part of the present research work was specifically developed.\nThe profile tested had a Z section with a height of 200 mm and thickness of 1.5 mm. Different Z profiles were spanned for 6 m, inside the furnace, with an overhanging part (cantilever) of 2.5 mm on one side, outside the furnace (see Figure 4.19).\n\t815 f\t\t\t?\t815 K\nIf\t1 Z200/1.5\tj:Z200/2,0 \u00a3\ti SLEEVE ;j\tZ200/1.5\n\t1U140\tU140 P , 6000\tz\t2500\n\tINSIDE FURNACE\tOUTSIDE FURNACE\nFigure 4.19 - Template of the tested Z purlin (Jandera and Schwarz, 2014)\nThe aim of the overhanging part (cantilever) was to simulate an internal support of a continuous beam. A sleeve system was adopted in this connection. Inside the furnace one element was used for the span, outside the furnace for the cantilevered part, and for the connection a thicker element (Z purlin height 200 mm and thickness of 2.0 mm) was interconnecting both elements at the hogging moment area. All sections are S350GD steel grade.\nThe loads were chosen in order to represent a realistic example of a roof structural element (purlins), based on the ultimate limit state combination, at normal temperatures. The dead weight of a sandwich panel and the snow load representing more than 90% use of the element in normal conditions were considered. This leads to a load of 0.5 kN/m for the member inside the furnace, the load was imposed by attaching it to the web each 1 m of the span length, and a 1 kN at the end of the element outside the furnace was also imposed, at the top of the member.\nComparisons between the imposed heating curve ISO834 (CEN, 2012) and the measured temperature inside the furnace are presented on Figure 4.20. The element temperature was measured with welded thermocouples in three parts (upper flange, web and lower flange) of two different cross-sections (mid-span and at 500 mm from the support) (Figure 4.21). The average temperatures at mid-span and at the support are presented on Figure 4.20.\nFigure 4.20 - Comparison between the ISO834 curve and the gas temperature, and the element temperature\nFigure 4.21 - Thermocouples applied on the element (Jandera and Schwarz, 2014)\nAccording to EN 1363-1 (CEN, 2012), for flexural loaded elements, the failure to support the load occurs when one of the following criteria has been exceeded (Table 4.8):\nTable 4.8 - Criteria for flexural loaded elements and respective values for the present fire test\nLimiting deflection\nLimiting rate of deflection\nL2\n400d\n60002\n400 x 200\n= 450mm\ndD\ndt\nL2\n9000d\n60002\n9000 x 200\n20mm.min\n-i\nwhere $ is the span of the element and d is the distance from the extreme fibre of the cold design compression zone to the extreme fibre of the cold design tension zone of the structural section. However, the rate of the deflection criteria is not applied in the first 10 min of the fire test, since relatively fast deflection can occur until stable conditions are reached. The Z purlin is supported by a pair of U-profiles with four bolts each one. The boundary conditions for the numerical models are presented on Figure 4.22 and\nFigure 4.23. The distributed loads were considered as point loads on end points from U-profiles and a point load at the end of the cantilever (Figure 4.24).\nb) Cantilever\nFigure 4.22 - Boundary conditions applied on numerical model elements\nFigure 4.24 - Loads applied on the Z purlin numerical model\nFigure 4.23 - Lateral restriction on cantilever and U-support\nThe temperature considered in the Z purlin on the numerical model was the one obtained on the experimental test. The different constitutive laws from Annex E and FN Annex were studied.\nThe numerical model with all the previous considerations is presented on Figure 4.25 where it is possible to compare the design drawing with the final numerical model adopted for the present research work.\nT5S-5X-97SAU \u00ab\n\t\t\nIt\tEZ\t:\t:\t:\t:\t: j: : f\t\n\t1 DOOM\tD00/Z0  \u00ab000\t\n\t\t\na) Design drawing (Jandera and Schwarz, 2014)\nb) Numerical model\nO<\t\t\t\t\t\u2014>\n\tii\t\u25a0\nii \u2019\t!\t1111 -1 1 \u00ab\t>\t\nFigure 4.25 - Numerical model and respective temperature from the Z purlin adopted for the SAFIR numerical model analysis\nThe influence of geometrical imperfections and constitutive laws on the numerical model\u2019s behaviour was analysed. The obtained results from the experimental fire test and from the numerical analysis with and without imperfections and considering de different constitutive laws are presented in Figure 4.26.\nFigure 4.26 - Deflection-time comparison between experimental and numerical models at mid-span\nFrom Figure 4.26 it is possible to observe the evolution of the deflection from the Z purlin, in function of time, at mid-span. The difference between the numerical model behaviour considering the Annex E or the FN Annex constitutive law after 19 min is notable. The results are closer to the experimental results considering the FN Annex.\nFigure 4.27 shows the time of each criteria reached by the experimental and the numerical analysis adopted (considering the FN Annex constitutive law).\nFigure 4.27 - Criteria for flexural loaded elements and respective values reached in experimental and numerical tests at mid-span\nThe first limiting criterion to be reached was the limiting rate of deflection, after 17 min by the experimental fire test and after 22 min by the numerical analysis. As mentioned before, according to EN 1363-1, the rate of the deflection criterion is not applied in the first 10 min of the fire test, since relatively fast deflection can occur until stable conditions are reached as observed at the minute 6 of the fire resistance test. The second limiting criterion was reached by the fire test after 42 min and by the numerical analysis after 59 min.\nAfter 15 min it is possible to observe the lateral-torsional phenomenon occurring (Figure 4.28) before the first criterion reached. Around the 20 min of fire test and 22 min of numerical analysis the phenomenon of catenary action is starting to develop. From Figure 4.29 the Z purlin behaviour is similar to a tensile element (catenary action).\na) Experimental (Jandera and Schwarz, 2014)\tb) Numerical\nFigure 4.28 - Lateral-torsional buckling phenomenon observed after 15 min\na) Experimental (Jandera and Schwarz, 2014)\tb) Numerical\nFigure 4.29 - Catenary action observed after 30 min\nThe end of the experimental test and numerical analysis was considered after the catenary action occurs for a high deflection as observed.

A relatively good agreement between the numerical results and the fire test results was obtained with the adopted numerical model presented in this section.\nConsidering the FN Annex constitutive law, the results present an approximation to the experimental results. The shape of the numerical model curve is closer to the experimental curve configuration. Also the behaviour of both analyses is very similar. Therefore, it is important to take into account the reduction factors from the FN Annex constitutive law for cold-formed profiles to obtain more realistic results for this type of profiles.\n4.4\tFinal considerations\nIn this chapter it is presented the numerical modelling of some experimental tests from the literature and from the performed work, and general conclusions were obtained.\nFrom these chapter analyses it is concluded that it is possible to create a numerical model with the same characteristics and conditions of an experimental test, at normal and elevated temperatures.\nIt is important to consider the initial geometric imperfections on the numerical models, since with this consideration closer results to the experimental tests were obtained. In\nChapter 5 it is going to be analysed which amplitudes for the initial geometric imperfections are better to take into account on the numerical models.\nWhen considering the FN Annex constitutive law in all the fire analysis, the results presented a better approximation to the experimental results. As mentioned before, it is important to take into account the reduction factors from the FN Annex constitutive law for cold-formed profiles to obtain more realistic results for cold-formed steel profiles.\nIn general, from all the previous analysis, it is visible a good agreement between the numerical analysis and the experimental tests, in terms of results and elements structural behaviour in fire.\nChapter 5\nParametric modelling study\n5\tParametric modelling study\n5.1\tGeneral considerations\n5.2\tNumerical models\n5.3\tBuckling modes\n5.4\tInfluence of different parameters for model admeasurement\n5.4.1\tInitial geometric imperfections\n5.4.2\tResidual stresses\n5.4.3\tCorner enhancement\n5.5\tInfluence of different parameters for case study's admeasurement\n5.5.1\tCross-section slenderness\n5.5.2\tTemperature\n5.5.3\tSteel grades\n5.5.4\tBending moment diagram\n5.6\tCase studies for validation of design proposals\n5.7\tFinal considerations\n5\tParametric modelling study\n5.1\tGeneral considerations\nSteel structural elements are susceptible to the occurrence of local, distortional and global buckling phenomena. However, depending on the element or cross-section type, these buckling phenomena have different susceptibility to occur.\nThis chapter presents a parametric study through numerical analyses on the behaviour of simply supported elements, considering different initial imperfections, temperatures, cross-section slendernesses and steel grades. The different case studies chosen for the extended numerical analyses presented in Chapter 6 for code validation are also presented.\nOn this research, lipped channel cross-sections (C) and sigma sections (S) were studied. These two section types were chosen due to being two of the most common cold-formed shapes applied in construction.\nIn Chapter 5, three types of members are considered: axially compressed (columns), subjected to bending (beams) and the previous actions combined (beam-columns). The respective numerical models are presented. The different instability modes are represented and the influence of different parameters for model and case study's admeasurement are analysed. For beam-columns, some of the assumptions were taken into account from beams and columns for being a particular situation of both cases combined. Therefore, only the numerical models adopted and the influence of different parameters for case study's admeasurement is analysed.\nThe purpose of this chapter is to test the consistency of the numerical models in columns, beams and beam-columns.\n5.2\tNumerical models\nIn the finite element model, rectangular shell finite elements, with four points of integration on the surface of the element, were used due to the walls high slenderness, to reproduce local buckling phenomena (see Figure 5.1 and Figure 5.2).\nLoads were applied, in the parallel directions to the element axis, according to the correspondent linear stresses distribution. The restrictions were imposed in order to\nreproduce one end pinned support and one roller support (simply supported). It was not considered the increased yield strength, due to the cold formed process, as it is not also considered in EC3 analytical calculations when local/distortional buckling is due to occur. The constitutive law considered was the one prescribed in EN1993-1-2 using its Annex E, for Class 4 cross-sections. The elevated temperatures were considered uniform throughout the cross-section, for an easier comparison with the design formulations proposed in EC3 and due to the reduced thickness of the profile\u2019s walls.\n5.2.1\tColumns\nAt columns, concentrated loads were applied in the parallel direction to the lipped channel section columns axis along the whole section according to the linear stresses distribution resulting from compression action. The thickness of the shell elements was increased at the column ends to avoid local buckling instabilities on these parts when loads and restrictions are applied. In Figure 5.1 the numerical model with constraints and loads, at elevated temperatures, is presented.\nFigure 5.1 - Adopted numerical model for lipped channel cross-section columns\nThe same considerations were taken into account on sigma, as presented in Figure 5.2.\ni! 11\nI\tI\n11\nII\nill\n11 ! u\n! ii\n11\n!\n! i! ii\nI I i! ii\nFigure 5.2 - Adopted numerical model for sigma cross-section columns\n\na\n5.2.2\tBeams\nRegarding beams loads were applied, in the parallel direction to the lipped channel section beam axis, according to the linear stresses distribution resulting from simple elastic bending around the strong axis, imposing uniform bending diagram in the beams length. In Figure 5.3, the numerical model with constraints and loads at elevated temperatures is presented.\nFigure 5.3 - Adopted numerical model for lipped channel cross-section beams\nIn Figure 5.4, the numerical model with constraints and loads at elevated temperatures for sigma cross-section beams is presented.\nFigure 5.4 - Adopted numerical model for sigma cross-section beams\n5.2.3\tBeam-columns\nAbout beam-columns, loads were applied in the parallel direction to the lipped channel section beam axis, according to the linear stresses distribution resulting from simple elastic bending around the strong axis and the compression action. Beam-columns with and without lateral buckling restrictions are studied.\n5.2.3.1\tWithout lateral torsional buckling\nTo study beam-columns without the lateral torsional buckling phenomenon restricted is presented in Figure 5.5, for lipped channel cross-sections, the numerical model adopted\nfor the analysis of this case. The restrictions applied in the corner do not allow the displacements out-of-plan.\nF0\nZ\nFigure 5.5 - Adopted numerical model for lipped channel cross-section beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling\n\nFor sigma cross-sections, the numerical model performed for the element analysis without lateral torsional buckling is shown in Figure 5.6.\nFigure 5.6 - Adopted numerical model for sigma cross-section beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling\n5.2.3.2\tWith lateral torsional buckling\nFigure 5.7 shows the numerical model for lipped channel cross-section beam-column element where the lateral torsional buckling is allowed.\nFigure 5.7 - Adopted numerical model for lipped channel cross-section beam-columns with lateral torsional buckling\n\nAnd finally, the numerical model with constraints and loads at elevated temperatures for sigma cross-section beam-columns is presented on Figure 5.8.\nFigure 5.8 - Adopted numerical model for sigma cross-section beam-columns with lateral torsional buckling\n5.3\tBuckling modes\nFor a better understanding of the analysed members behaviour, this section presents the critical loads of elastic instability and the correspondent instability modes obtained through numerical analysis for the different elements. A comparison between the numerical results obtained with the CAST3M (CAST3M, 2012) software associated with RUBY (Couto et al., 2013) interface for SAFIR (Franssen, 2005) and the curve corresponded to elastic instability modes obtained with the CUFSM (Schafer and Adany, 2006) software is presented.\n5.3.1\tColumns\nThe determined critical loads of elastic instability and the correspondent modes, through numerical analysis carried out at the simply supported columns subjected to normal temperature (Figure 5.9 to Figure 5.12) are here presented. Initial geometric imperfections and residual stresses were not introduced.\nFor a better understanding of the existing instability modes, Figure 5.9 to Figure 5.12 present a comparative analysis between the instability modes that the lipped channel cross-section profile can suffer when subjected to axial compression. The crosssection\u2019s and element\u2019s shape is also illustrated, selecting different half-wavelength with different results for an easier comprehension of the different obtained results.\nFigure 5.9 - Critical load factors based on half-wavelength for the lipped channel cross-section C_155x77x31x(2.0) column\na) Local instability mode\nb) Distortional instability mode\nc) Global (flexural/torsional) instability mode\nFigure 5.10 - Instability modes based on half-wavelength obtained with CAST3M and CUFSM for the lipped channel cross-section C_155x77x31x(2.0) column\nCUFSM\nCAST3M\nd) Global (flexural) instability mode\nAt Figure 5.9 and Figure 5.10, the different buckling modes based on half-wavelength for the different element lengths are presented: the local buckling for small lengths, the distortional buckling for intermediate lengths and the global buckling for long lengths. It is still possible to observe two different global buckling modes for long lengths: flexural/torsional and only flexural.\nThe first critical buckling modes observed for the same element lengths are presented on Figure 5.11 and Figure 5.12.\nFigure 5.11 - Critical load factors for first buckling modes for the lipped channel cross-section C_155x77x31x(2.0) column\nCAST3M\nCUFSM\na) Local instability mode\nb) Local instability mode\nFigure 5.12 - Instability modes based on first buckling mode obtained with CAST3M and CUFSM for the lipped channel cross-section C_155x77x31x(2.0) column\nIt can be observed the predominance of local buckling on small and intermediate lengths columns, and global buckling on long lengths columns.\nIn Figure 5.13 to Figure 5.16 it is possible to observe the same analysis and the results for sigma cross-section elements.\nE_229x64x20x(1.5)\n\to CAST3M + RUBY \u2014CUFSM\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\\o\ta)\t\n\t!\to\\.\ti\n\ti\t1\t1\t1\t1\u2014i\u2014i\u2014i\u2014i\u2014i\t1\t1\t1\u2014iT i 1 1 -i\n1.00E+01\t1.00E+02\t1.00E+03\t1.00E+04\nHalf-wavelength (mm)\nFigure 5.13 - Critical load factors based on half-wavelength for the sigma cross-section\nL_229x64x20x(1.5) column\nCAST3M\nCUFSM\nb) Distortional instability mode\nc) Global+Distortional instability mode\nFigure 5.14 - Instability modes based on half-wavelength obtained with CAST3M and CUFSM for the sigma cross-section L_229x64x20x(1.5) column\nIn Figure 5.13 and Figure 5.14, the different buckling modes based on half-wavelength for the different element lengths are presented: the local buckling for small lengths, the distortional buckling for intermediate lengths and the global+distortional buckling for long lengths.\nThe first critical buckling modes observed for the same element lengths are presented on Figure 5.15 and Figure 5.16, where it can be observed the predominance of local buckling on small and intermediate lengths beams and global+distortional buckling on long lengths beams.\nFigure 5.15 - Critical load factors for first buckling modes for the sigma cross-section E_229x64x20x(1.5) column\nCAST3M\nCAST3M\nCUFSM\na)\tLocal instability mode\nb)\tLocal instability mode\nFigure 5.16 - Instability modes based on first buckling modes obtained with CAST3M and CUFSM for the sigma cross-section E_229x64x20x(1.5) column\nFrom the charts and shapes of the elastic instability modes shown in Figure 5.9 to Figure 5.16, it is possible to observe a good agreement between the results obtained with CAST3M and the RUBY interface, and CUFSM software with the model developed for this work.\n5.3.2\tBeams\nThe determined critical loads of elastic instability and the correspondent modes, through numerical analysis carried out at the simply supported beams subjected to normal temperature are here presented.

In Figure 5.21 to Figure 5.24 is possible to represent the same analysis and the results for a sigma cross-section.\nFigure 5.21 - Critical load factors based on half-wavelength for the sigma cross-section E_229x64x20x(1.5) beam\na) Local instability mode\tb) Distortional instability mode\nc) Global instability mode\nFigure 5.22 - Instability modes based on half-wavelength obtained with CAST3M and CUFSM for the sigma cross-section E_229x64x20x(1.5) beam\nIn Figure 5.21 and Figure 5.22, the different buckling modes based on half-wavelength for the different element lengths are presented: the local buckling for small lengths, the distortional buckling for intermediate lengths and the global buckling for long lengths.\nThe first critical buckling modes observed for the same element lengths are on Figure\n5.23 and Figure 5.24.\nFigure 5.23 - Critical load factors for first buckling modes for the sigma cross-section E_229x64x20x(1.5) beam\na) Local instability mode\tb) Distortional instability mode\nFigure 5.24 - Instability modes based on first buckling modes obtained with CAST3M and CUFSM for the sigma cross-section L_229x64x20x(1.5) beam\nIn this case it can be observed the predominance of local buckling on small lengths beams, distortional buckling on intermediate lengths beams and global buckling on long lengths beams.\nFrom the Figure 5.17 to Figure 5.24, it is once again possible to observe a good agreement between the results obtained with the RUBY interface and CUFSM software as concluded for the column elements which helps to stablish the numerical model to be applied in the present thesis.\n5.4\tInfluence of different parameters for model admeasurement\nHere is presented the influence of different parameters on the ultimate bearing capacity of the studied members at elevated temperatures considering the numerical models from section 5.3. The different initial imperfections (geometric and material imperfections), the corner enhancement and residual stresses due to the cold-forming processes are here analysed for columns and beams.\nThe main purpose of this section is to compare the numerical results obtained from SAFIR analysis by varying the different mentioned parameters. The comparison with the EC3 rules is a topic that will be covered in Chapter 6. Therefore, these analyses are presented considering the EN1993-1-2 rules and the Constitutive Law from the respective Annex E only to have a basic possible reference of comparison.\n5.4.1\tInitial geometric imperfections\nGeometric initial imperfections are taken into account in the models analysis. To generate these imperfections, different shapes based on the local, distortional and global buckling modes are used. For that purpose CAST3M and RUBY software are applied, where the lowest Eigen value for each instability mode is considered.\nTable 5.1 shows the maximum magnitude for the three buckling modes imperfection considered from different literatures, where h is the height of the web or width of the flange, whichever presents the larger deflection, and L the element length.\nTable 5.1 - Geometric imperfections magnitudes from different references\nReference\tGeometric imperfections magnitudes considered\t\t\n\tLocal\tDistortional\tGlobal\nEN 1090-2 (CEN, 2008)\th\th\t$\n\t100\t100\t750\nEN 10162 (CEN, 2003)\th\th\t$\n\t125\t125\t500\nKaitila (2002)\th\th\t$\n\t200\t200\t500\nECCS Manual (Dubina et al., 2012)\t0,006h or t\t0,006h or t\t$ $ 1000 Or 1500\nBasaglia and Camotim (2011)\t0,10)\t0,10)\t$ 1000\nFrom the values given in Table 5.1, 80% of geometric imperfections magnitudes are considered following the EN1993-1-5 Annex C.

For the numerical models considering Basaglia and Camotim (2011) proposals for magnitude imperfections the results are very high, which means that are less influent on numerical models resistance. Therefore, the EN1090-2 magnitudes are considered on column models to be on the safe side, representing the most critical situation.\nFor better understanding the influence of the imperfections, the following situations were compared (Figure 5.29):\n\u2022\twithout geometrical imperfections;\n\u2022\twith geometrical imperfections corresponded to the local buckling mode;\n\u2022\twith geometrical imperfections corresponded to the distortional buckling mode;\n\u2022\twith geometrical imperfections corresponded to the global buckling mode;\n\u2022\twith geometrical imperfections corresponded to combination of the different buckling modes.\nC_229x64x2Ox(l.5)\nrsakir\t500 \"C\t_________fy=355MPa\n\t\tConstitutive Law EN 1993-1-2\n\t\tSafe x\tH\t\n\tA\t.\t\tA\t i\t A\ti\t* \t)\t\t\t\nS\tg\t8\to \u2022\t\u2022\t\u2022\t2\ti $\t\tA\tb .JoL\tis\tJ\nft\tV\t\u2022\tft\n\t\t\nX SAFIR without imperfections A SAFIR with distortional imperfections O SAFIR with local imperfections O SAFIR with global imperfections \u2022 SAFIR with local, global and distortional combination \u2014EN 1993-1-2\tUnsafe\t\n0.00\t0.20\t0.40\t0.60\t0.80\t1.00\t1.20\t1.40\t1.60\t1.80\t2.00\nFigure 5.29- Numerical results of the influence of initial imperfections on lipped channel section\ncolumns numerical model\nFrom the chart in Figure 5.29, it is observed that the columns without any imperfections reach higher resistances compared to the ones which take into account the initial imperfections (as expected). It can be noticed the influence of the introduction of different geometrical imperfections. In this particular case, for all slendernesses the analysis with local imperfections gives lower ultimate loads when compared with the other simulations, as well as the distortional imperfections. The columns with the combined imperfections give lower resistances than the ones with the separate imperfections.\nFigure 5.30 shows the same analysis for sigma cross-section columns S_229x64x20, steel grade S355 and for 500 \u00b0C.\nf =3SSMPa\n0.80\t\u2014EN 1993-1-2\n0.60\tx SAFIR without geometric imperfections O SAFIR with local imperfections\n0.40\tA SAFIR with distortional imperfections\tUnsafe\n0.20\t\u25a1 SAFIR with global imperfections\n0.00\tA SAFIR with local, distortional and global combination \t\t\t.\t\t\t z,e\n0.00\t0.20\t0.40\t0.60\t0.80\t1.00\t1.20\t1.40\t1.60\t1.80\t2.00\nFigure 5.30- Numerical results of the influence of initial imperfections on sigma section columns numerical model\nAgain, from the chart in Figure 5.30, it is observed that the columns without any imperfections reach higher resistances compared to the ones which take into account the initial imperfections.\nThe influence of the introduction of different geometrical imperfections in sigma crosssection is less obvious when compared to lipped channel cross-section columns. In this particular case, for all slendernesses the analysis with local imperfections gives lower ultimate loads when compared with the other simulations.\nFrom this analysis it is possible to conclude that it is important to consider all the initial geometric imperfections on columns for the different analysis.\n5.4.1.2\tBeams\nThe same study of the influence of the initial geometric imperfections on the ultimate load bearing capacity is made for cold-formed beams on fire conditions. In addition, the performance of the simple calculation rules prescribed in EN1993-1-2 is also analysed, when compared to the numerical results.\nWith the purpose of analysing only the member buckling curve and not the crosssection resistance, the last was made equal to the numerically obtained resistant bending moment for a laterally restrained beam (Figure 5.31), and the critical bending moment was also determined numerically with CAST3M software and RUBY interface. The mesh was maintained equally divided to preserve the model continuity.\na) Lipped channel section model\nb) Sigma section model\nFigure 5.31 - Laterally restrained beam numerical models\nIn Figure 5.32 to Figure 5.34 the influence of each geometric imperfection on lipped channel beams from different references is presented and the results compared with the EC3 buckling curve for high temperatures (500 \u00b0C), S355 steel grade and section C_229x64x20.\nFigure 5.32 - Influence of different local magnitudes on lipped channel beams resistance\nFigure 5.33 - Influence of different distortional magnitudes on lipped channel beams resistance\n\t=\t\t\t\t\tConstitutive Law EN 1993-1-2\t\n\u25a0\t\u00cd\t\tS\t\u00ab\tX o e\tX o\t\t\tSafe\t\n\t\t\t\t\u25a0\t\u201cX - \u00a7\t\t\t\t\t\t\n= SAFIR without imperfections o SAFIR Distortional b/100 a SAFIR Distortional b/125 o SAFIR Distortional b/200 \u25a1 SAFIR Distortional 0.006h SAFIR Distortional 0. lOt \u2014EN 1993-1-2\t\t\t\t\t\tI\tA\t=\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u25a1 = 0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUnsafe\nFigure 5.34 - influence of different global magnitudes on lipped channel beams resistance\nAlso, according to each reference, the initial imperfections were combined considering EN1993-1-5 prescriptions (Figure 5.35).\nFigure 5.35 - influence of different imperfections combination on lipped channel beams resistance\nThe lower resistance values occur on models which considered imperfections are related to EN1090-2 and EN10162 rules, as also concluded for columns. For the numerical models considering Basaglia &amp; Camotim magnitude imperfections the results are again very high. Therefore, the EN1090-2 magnitudes were also considered on beam models to be on the safe side, representing the most critical situation. For better understanding the influence of the imperfections, the following numerical models situations are analysed (Figure 5.36):\n\u2022 without geometrical imperfections;\n\u2022\twith geometrical imperfections corresponded to the local buckling mode;\n\u2022\twith geometrical imperfections corresponded to the distortional buckling mode;\n\u2022\twith geometrical imperfections corresponded to the global buckling mode;\n\u2022\twith geometrical imperfections corresponded to combination of the different buckling modes.\n0.20\n0.40\n\tJ\t\tX\t\t\t\tConstitutive Law EN 1993-1-2\t\n\t2\t\u00ea \u25b2\t\u25a1 \u00ea\tX \u25a1\tX\t\t\t\n\t\tA\t\tA'\u201c 2\t0\tX\t\t\n\u2014EN 1993-1-2 X SAFIR without imperfections\t\t\t\tA\t0 2\tX \u25a1 A\tX\na SAFIR with distortional imperfections \u25a1 SAFIR with global imperfections\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\no SAFJR with local imperfections \u25b2 SAFIR with local, global and distortioi\t\t\tial combine\tition\t\t\t\n0.00\n0.00\t0.20\t0.40\t0.60\t0.80\t1.00\nFigure 5.36 - Numerical results of the influence of initial imperfections on lipped channel section\nbeams numerical model\nIt can be observed on Figure 5.36 that the imperfections have a big influence on the beams fire resistance. The analysis with local imperfections gives lower ultimate loads when compared with the other simulations. The beams with the combined imperfections give lower resistance values than the ones with the separate imperfections. Figure 5.37 shows the same analysis for sigma cross-section beams at 500 \u00b0C, S355 steel grade.\n1.20\n^/Msafir,res\nE_229x64x20x(1.5)\n500 \u00b0C\nfy=355 MPa\nConstitutive Law EN 1993-1-2\n1.00\n0.80\n0.60\n0.40\n0.20\n0.00\n0.i\n\u2014EN 1993-1-2\nX SAFIR without imperfections\nA SAFIR with distortional imperfections\n\u25a1 SAFIR with global imperfections\no SAFIR with local imperfections\na SAFIR with local, global and distortional combination\nA.\n0.20\n0.40\n0.60\n0.80\n1.00\n1.20\n1.40\n1.60\n2.00\nFigure 5.37 - Numerical results of the influence of initial imperfections on sigma section beams numerical model\nFrom Figure 5.37 it is possible to conclude that the influence of the introduction of different geometrical imperfections is less obvious when compared to lipped channel cross-section beams. In this particular case, for small and intermediate slendernesses the analysis with local imperfections gives lower ultimate loads when compared with the other simulations and global imperfections for high slendernesses.\nFrom this analysis it is possible to conclude that it is important to consider all the initial geometric imperfections on beams for the different analysis.\n5.4.2\tResidual stresses\nMaterial imperfections can be presented as residual stresses which normally appear due to fabrication processes. Schafer and Pekoz (1998a) presented different residual stresses values and paterns, depending on the cold-forming process, cold-rolling or press braking, for cold-formed steel lipped channel sections, which values are presented on Table 5.2. The results are distributed by elements where the residual stresses were measured: corner, flange, lip and web.\nTable 5.2 - Residual stresses %fy for lipped channel sections by Schafer &amp; Pekoz\n\tMembrane\t\tFlexural\t\nElement\tCold-rolling\tPress braking\tCold-rolling\tPress braking\nCorner\t7\t5\t27\t33\nFlange\t4\t1\t23\t8\nLip\t8\t0\t7\t56*\nWeb\t-2\t1\t39\t17\n*Some lips are flame-cut, thus distorting this value. Value not adopted for residual stresses configuration.\nAn analysis considering the different residual stresses is performed applying the research values of Schafer and Pekoz (1998a) on models with and without initial geometric imperfections. According to the previous research, the lip values were not considered, the web values were applied on internal elements and the flange on external elements (Figure 5.38). Again, comparisons are made for columns and beams.\nFigure 5.38 - Applied residual stresses diagram (flexural - cold-rolling) (Schafer and Pekoz, 1998a)\n5.4.2.1\tColumns\nFigure 5.39 shows the results for each residual stress on the different lipped channel columns numerical models.\n0.80\n0.60\n0.00\n0.00\n0.40\n0.20\n^SAFIR\tC_229x64x20x(l. 5) 500 \u00b0C\tfy=355MPa\t\n\t\tConstitutive Law EN 1993-1-2\n\t\tSafe\n\t8 *\tB\tg x\tx\nn \u25a0 g\t1 \u2022\t\u00ae\t\u00a7\tS \u2019\t\u2666\tA \u2018 \u2019 1\ng\t\t\nWithout initial geometric imperfections X SAFIR without residual stresses A SAFIR with membrane residual stresses - Cold-rolling O SAFIR with flexural residual stresses - Cold-rolling \u25a1 SAFIR with membrane residual stresses - Press-braking O SAFIR with flexural residual stresses - Press-braking \u2014EN 1993-1-2\t\tWith initial geometric imperfections\tUnsafe - SAFIR without residual stresses A SAFIR with membrane residual stresses - Cold-rolling \u2666\tSAFIR with flexural residual stresses - Cold-rolling \u25a0 SAFIR with membrane residual stresses - Press-braking \u2022\tSAFIR with flexural residual stresses - Press-braking\n0.20\n0.60\n0.40\n1.60\nFigure 5.39 - Numerical results of the influence of residual stresses on lipped channel column numerical models\nSome differences are visible on the ultimate bearing critical load for the elements without initial imperfections. As referred by Schafer and Pekoz (1998a) research work, the most critical material imperfection is the flexural type. But, combined with the initial geometric imperfections, the differences observed are minimal, which means that the effect of the residual stresses can be neglected when combined all the initial imperfections. For this reason, the residual stresses were not taken into account for sigma columns, apart from the lack of information of how to consider these ones for this specific cross-section.\n5.4.2.2\tBeams\nThe same analysis is performed for lipped channel cross-sections beams. Figure 5.40 shows the results for each residual stress on the different lipped channel beams numerical models.\nf,=355MPa\nWith initial geometric imperfections\n- SAFIR without residual stresses\nA SAFIR with membrane residual stresses - Cold-rolling\n\u2666\tSAFIR with flexural residual stresses - Cold-rolling\n\u25a0 SAFIR with membrane residual stresses - Press-braking\n\u2022\tSAFIR w ith flexural residual stresses - Press-braking\nFigure 5.40 - Numerical results of the influence of residual stresses on lipped channel beam numerical models\nu itliout initial geometric imperfections\n* SAFIR without residual stresses\nA SAFIR with membrane residual stresses - Cold-rolling o SAFIR with flexural residual stresses - Cold-rolling\n\u25a1 SAFIR witfl membrane residual stresses - Press-braking\nO SAFIR with flexural residual stresses - Press-brakins\nSome differences are visible on the ultimate load for the elements without initial imperfections. Once again, the flexural residual stresses are the most important. Considering the residual stresses with the worst initial geometric imperfections combinations has a low influence on the ultimate bearing resistances (Figure 5.40), because the ultimate load is extremely affected by all the geometric imperfections and the residual stresses do not have any impact on the resistance values. And once again, the residual stresses were not taken into account for sigma beams.\n5.4.3\tCorner enhancement\nThe corner enhancement is one final influence of the fabrication process on the ultimate bearing capacity. According to EN1993-1-3, to consider the corner enhancement on cross-section\u2019s corners due to the cold-forming process the average yield strength fya may be used instead of the basic yield strength fyb.\nThe average yield strength f@a may be determined from the results of full size tests, or alternatively by calculation using Eq. (5.1):\nfya - fyb + (fu f fyb) A\u2014\t2\t(5.1)\nwhere,\n\u2022\tAg is the gross cross-sectional area;\n\u2022\tk is the numerical coefficient that depends on the type of forming (k \u2014 7 for cold-rolling and k = 5 for other methods of forming - press-braking);\n\u2022\tn is the number of 90\u00b0 bends in the cross-section with an internal radius r &lt;5t (fractions of 90\u00b0 bends should be counted as fractions of n)\n\u2022\tt is the design core thickness of the steel material before cold-forming.\nIn this section an analysis considering the different cold-forming processes is performed considering the average yield strength fya instead of the basic yield strength fyb on models with and without initial geometric imperfections. Although, EC3 states that this parameter should not be considered when buckling occurs.\n5.4.3.1\tColumns\nFigure 5.41 shows the results for each cold-forming process on the different lipped channel column numerical models and Figure 5.42 presents the obtained results for sigma columns.\n\tConstitutive Law EN 1993-1-2\n\tSafe\na\t\u00ae\t*\t*\tas\t\u00a1K\tX\t*\n\t\n\t\u2022 \u2022\n\tUnsafe\nWithout initial geometric imperfections\tWith initial geometric imperfections x SAFIR without comer enhancement\t\u2014 SAFIR without comer enhancement o SAFIR with comer enhancement - Cold-rolling\t\u2666 SAFIR with comer enhancement - Cold-rolling C SAFIR with comer enhancement - Press-braking\t\u2022 SAFIR with comer enhancement - Press-braking \u2014EN 1993-1-2\t\nFigure 5.41 - Numerical results of the influence of corner enhancement on lipped channel column numerical models\nFigure 5.42 - Numerical results of the influence of corner enhancement on sigma column numerical models\nIn Figure 5.41 and Figure 5.42 the differences considering the corner enhancement for long slenderness models are minimal, increasing a not significant resistance value for small slenderness models. When combined with the initial geometric imperfections the differences are very small, which means that it is possible to neglect the small effects on elements numerical modelling when combined with geometric imperfections.\n5.4.3.2\tBeams\nThe same analysis was performed beams.

When combined with the initial geometric imperfections the differences are null for intermediate and long slendernesses, which means that it is possible to neglect the small effects on elements numerical modelling when combined with geometric imperfections. The differences are more visible on sigma elements due to the increased folds on the web when compared to lipped channel elements.\nThis general effect occurs due to the small difference between the average yield strength (fya) and the basic yield strength fy&amp;. Beyond this, EN1993-1-3 refers to consider the increased yield strength due to cold-forming under specific situations (see 3.2.2.(4) and 3.2.2.(5) from EN1993-1-3).\n5.5\tInfluence of different parameters for case study's admeasurement\nThis section presents the influence of different parameters to be considered on the case studies afterwards. It is presented a numerical study considering different cross-sections slendernesses, temperatures, steel grades and loading types, for beams, columns and beam-columns. After the analysis performed at section 5.4 and the respective conclusions, the initial imperfections considered where the ones from EN 1090-2 (CEN, 2008) and the residual stresses and the corner enhancement were not considered on the following numerical models.\n5.5.1\tCross-section slenderness\nTo study the influence of considering different cross-section slenderness, several crosssections with different dimension values were chosen corresponded to different slenderness values. All the study cases are here analysed for 500 \u00b0C and yield strength of 355MPa.\n5.5.1.1\tColumns\nAs Figure 5.29 shows the results for a section C_229x64x20, here is presented a section with less slender web (Figure 5.45 shows the results for lipped channel column numerical models with C_155x77x31 cross-section).\n2.00\n0.00\n0.00\nf,=355MPa\n1.60\n1.40\n1.20\n1.00\n0.80\n0.60\n0.40\n0.20\nRsafer\nC_155x77x31x(2.0)\n500 \u00b0C\n\tConstitutive Law EN 1993-1-2\nX\tX\na\t\u00a7\t*\tSafe\n\tx\t 1\tQ\t\u2022\t\u00b0\t:\tO\t\u00ae\t\u2666 \u2022\t\u2022\t\u00b0\to\t0\nf\tt\tA\tA\t* \u2018 :\nx SAFIR without imperfections a SAFIR with distortional imperfections o SAFIR with local imperfections\t\n\t\no SAFIR with global (flexural/torsional) imperfections \u25a1 SAFIR with global (flexural) imperfections\tnSa e\t\n\u2022 SAFIR with local and global (flexural) combination a SAFIR with local, global (flexural) and distortional combination -EN 1993-1-2\t\n0.25\t0.50\t0.75\t1.00\t1.25\t1.50\t1.75\t2.00\t2.25\nFigure 5.45 - Numerical results for C_155x77x31 section column models\nComparing Figure 5.29 with Figure 5.45 it is possible to observe a similar behaviour between the results: the higher resistance values for the numerical models without imperfections, the lower resistance values for the numerical models with local imperfections compared with the other imperfections isolated, and the lowest resistance values for the numerical models with all the geometric imperfections combined.\nFigure 5.30 presents the results for the X_229x64x20 and Figure 5.46 shows the results for sigma column numerical models L_240x60x20 with a slenderer web.\nf=355MPa\n1.00\n0.60\n0.40\n0.20\n0.00\nX SAFIR without geometric imperfections\nA SAFIR with distortional imperfections\n\u25a1 SAFIR with global imperfections\nO SAFIR with local imperfections\na SAFIR with local, distortional and global combination\n\u2014EN 1993-1-2\nUnsafe\n0.00\n0.25\t0.50\t0.75\t1.00\t1.25\t1.50\t1.75\t2.00\t2.25\nFigure 5.46 - Numerical results for L_240x60x20 section column models\n\nFigure 5.30 and Figure 5.46 present results with similar behaviour, as concluded for lipped channel sections.\nIt can be concluded that sections from the same shape type can present similar behaviour. However, considering different shape types (lipped channel or sigma crosssections), particular differences can be found. In sigma cross-sections, the initial geometric imperfections have less influence than in lipped channel cross-sections. The results for lipped channel sections are lower when compared with sigma section results.\n5.5.1.2\tBeams\nOn Figure 5.47 and Figure 5.48 the numerical results of the numerical model with\nlipped channel section and sigma sections are presented with a less slender web when compared to Figure 5.36 and Figure 5.37.\n1.20\n0.00\n0.00\n1.00\n0.80\n0.60\n0.40\n0.20\nfy=355MPa\nC_155x77x31x(2.0)\n500 \u00b0C\nM/MSafirres\n\u00ae 8 \u2022 . *\t2 i w\t\t\tConstitutive Law EN 1993-1-2\n\tt\tX\u201d\u201d 0 \u2022\t\t\t\n\u2014 EN 1993-1-2\t\t\u2022 $\t\t\nX SAFIR without i a SAFIR with dist\tmperfections ortional imperfections\t*\tI 8\t\u00a5 :\n\u25a1 SAFIR with glol o SAFIR with loca\t)al imperfections il imperfections\t\t\t\u25a0 !\n\u2022 SAFIR with local and global combina a SAFIR with local, global and distortic\t\ttion nal combination\t\t\n0.20\t0.40\t0.60\t0.80\t1.00\t1.20\t1.40\t1.60\t1.80\t2.00\nFigure 5.47 - Numerical results for C_155x77x31 section beam models\n1.20\n1.00\n0.80\n0.60\n0.40\n0.20\n0.00\n0.\n00\n0.20\n0.40\n0.60\n0.80\n1.00\n1.20\n1.80\n2.00\n1.40\no SAFIR with local imperfections\na SAFIR with local, global and distortional combination\nA.8\nM/MSafir,res\n\u2014 EN 1993-1-2\nX SAFIR without imperfections\nA SAFIR with distortional imperfections\n\u25a1 SAFIR with global imperfections\nL_155x77x3 lx(2.0)\n500 \u00b0C\nfy=355MPa\nConstitutive Law EN 1993-1-2\nFigure 5.48 - Numerical results for L_150x43x20 section beam models\nComparing Figure 5.36 to Figure 5.47 and Figure 5.37 to Figure 5.48 an analogous behaviour is perceptible from the obtained results.

Therefore, it is recommended to analyse each geometric imperfection when a new cross-section is studied.\n5.5.1.3\tBeam-columns\nFor beam-columns the analysis is performed for elements without and with the possibility of occurrence of lateral torsional buckling.\n5.5.1.3.1\tWithout lateral torsional buckling\nFor three different lengths, two cross-sections are compared for lipped channel sections\n(Figure 5.49 and Figure 5.50) where the lateral torsional buckling is restricted.\no SAFIR\n\u2014EN1993-1-2\nV=1\n500 \u00b0C\nL=0.5m\nf)=355MPa C_229x64x20\nN/Nb.ri,t.Rd + l9AM/Mjnt Rd\n1.2 ---------------------------------\n0.6 0.8 1 1.2\nM/Mn.tJid\nFigure 5.49 - Numerical results for C_229x64x20 section beam-column models without lateral torsional buckling, for a) 0,5m, b) 1,5m and c) 5,0m\nFigure 5.50 - Numerical results for C_154x35x11 section beam-column models without lateral torsional buckling, for a) 0,5m, b) 1,5m and c) 5,0m\nAs it is possible to observe from Figure 5.49 and Figure 5.50, the behaviour between the results from the different cross-sections seem very similar.\n5.5.1.3.2\tWith lateral torsional buckling\nAlso for beam-columns with lateral torsional buckling allowed, the comparison between two different cross-sections is presented in Figure 5.51 and Figure 5.52.\na)\nFigure 5.51 - Numerical results for C_229x64x20 section beam-column models with lateral torsional buckling, for a) 0,5m, b) 1,5m and c) 5,0m\nc)\n1 1.2\no SAFIR \u2014EN1993-1-2\n\t\t\n&lt;\u00b0 X. 0\t\t\nX. o\t\t\nv=l 500 \u00b0C L=0.5m\t\u201cTOT\t\u2022 O\t\n\tN. \u00b0\t\nfy=355MPa\nC_154x35x11\nb)\nN/Nbfl \u00bf^d + kzAM/M^nytd\n\to SAFIR \tEN 1993-1-2\t\n\u2019 O\tT o:\t\t\n\\ \u00b0\t\t\n\t>\t\n\to\t\ny=l\t\\ 500 \u00b0C L=1.5m\t\t0\nfy=355MPa\t\\ C 154x35xll\t\\\t\t\nN/Nb_n tjjd + kjAM/MjjixRd\no SAFIR \u2014EN 1993-1-2\nV=1\n500 \u00b0C\nL=5.0m\n\u00c7=355MPa C_229x64x20\n\nFigure 5.52 - Numerical results for C_154x35x11 section beam-column models with lateral torsional buckling, for a) 0,5m, b) 1,5m and c) 5,0m\nThe results demonstrated a similar behaviour between them.

This study is performed for beams and beam-columns lipped channel and sigma cross-sections.\n5.5.4.1\tBeams\nOn beams, for non-uniform bending cases at small lengths members, a failure mode correspondent to shear buckling is observed (see Figure 5.81 and Figure 5.82).\nFigure 5.81 - Shear buckling effect observed for y= 0, for a lipped channel section\n\n\nFigure 5.82 - Shear buckling effect observed for y= -1, for a lipped channel section\nAs this instability phenomenon is not in the scope of this study, the correspondent values are not taken into account.\nFrom Figure 5.81 and Figure 5.82 it is possible to conclude that the numerical resistance increase significantly for the case of non-uniform bending. This behaviour of LTB is already considered in Part 1-1 of EC3, but not in Part 1-2.\nTo evaluate the different loading types for sigma cross-sections, the E_229x64x20x(1.5) cross-section is analysed applying different non-uniform bending moments (^ ratio 0 and -1, Figure 5.83 and Figure 5.84).\nFigure 5.83 - Results of the sigma beams for y= 0, for a sigma section\nIn non-uniform bending cases, especially for small length beams with ratio -1, a failure mode corresponding to shear buckling was observed (see Figure 5.84) as happened on lipped channel sections. Once again, this instability phenomenon is not in the scope of this study, therefore the corresponding values are not taken into account.\nS 229x64x20x(1.5)(<|\u00bb\u2014l)\nM/MSafirres\nConstitutive Law EN 1993-1-2\nOAQ....ft\t---\n<> A\nO\no\nfy=355MPa\nMethodology 1\nSAFIR 350 \u00b0C\nSAFIR 500 \u00b0C\nSAFIR 600 \u00b0C\nFigure 5.84 - Shear buckling effect observed for y= -1, for a sigma section\nFrom Figure 5.83 and Figure 5.84 charts, it is possible to conclude that the numerical resistance increases significantly for the case of non-uniform bending.\n5.5.4.2\tBeam-columns\nFor beam-columns, the analyses are presented below without and with lateral torsional buckling for lipped channel and sigma cross-sections at 500 \u00b0C and f=355MPa.\n5.5.4.2.1\tWithout lateral torsional buckling\nFor non-uniform bending cases the results are presented on Figure 5.85 for ^=0 and\nFigure 5.86 ^= -1 on lipped channel beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling.\nFigure 5.85 - Results of C_229x64x20 section beam-column models for k = 0 without lateral\ntorsional buckling: a) L=1.5m, b) L=3.0m and c) L=5.0m\nFigure 5.86 - Results of C_229x64x20 section beam-column models for k = \u20141 without lateral torsional buckling: a) L=1.5m, b) L=3.0m and c) L=5.0m\nFigure 5.87 - Collapse mode of a C_229x64x20 section beam-column model for k = _1 without lateral torsional buckling\nThe collapse mode presented on Figure 5.87 is obtained from one case of the beamcolumn lipped channel cross-section with ^ = \u2014 1 and without lateral torsional buckling, marked on the previous chart, where different phenomena are visible (local buckling, shear buckling).\nFigure 5.88 and Figure 5.89 represent the same analysis for sigma cross-section beamcolumns.\nFigure 5.88 - Results of L_229x64x20 section beam-column models for k = 0 without lateral torsional buckling: a) L=1.0m, b) L=2.5m and c) L=3.5m\nFigure 5.89 - Results of L_229x64x20 section beam-column models for k = without lateral torsional buckling: a) L=1.0m, b) L=2.5m and c) L=3.5m\nThe results are again higher when considering non-uniform bending k = \u2014 1 and 0.\nThese differences are important to be taking into account on the EC3 rules.\n5.5.4.2.2\tWith lateral torsional buckling\nConsidering the lateral torsional buckling phenomenon on lipped channel sections nonuniform bending cases results are presented on Figure 5.90 for k=0 and Figure 5.91 k= -1.

These cold-formed profiles are commonly used in buildings being quite common as roof or walls support elements.\nWhen compared with lipped channel sections, sigma cross-sections normally have advantageous structural features, where the shear centre is closer to the web and an enhanced web buckling resistance is observed.\nAs can be seen from section 5.5, the influence of the different parameters is important and is therefore taken into account in the parametric study of the Chapter 6. With the present research it is intended to extend the study of these cross-sections to evaluate the EC3 prescriptions.\nThree types of elements are presented, such as columns, beams and beam-columns, at elevated temperatures. Due to the mono-symmetrically of these cross-sections studied, the columns case will be an approximation of beam-columns study, due to the shift of centroidal axis of the effective cross-section relative to the gross cross-section.\n5.6.1\tColumns\nThe cold-formed lipped channel sections (C) presented on Table 5.3 (some of them already shown at the previous parametric study) were chosen for the numerical analysis of columns, where the comparison between the numerical results and the EC3 rules is presented in Chapter 6.\nTable 5.3 - Lipped channel sections analysed and respective dimensions - columns\t\t\t\t\nDesignation\tWeb (mm)\tFlange (mm)\tLip (mm)\tThickness (mm)\nC_229x64x20x(1.5)*\t229\t64\t20\t1.5\nC_170x64x20x(1.5)\t170\t64\t20\t1.5\nC_229x48x20x(1.5)\t229\t48\t20\t1.5\nC_229x64x15x(1.5)\t229\t64\t15\t1.5\nC_100x50x10x(1.6)**\t100\t50\t10\t1.6\nC 155x77x31x(2.0)***\t155\t77\t31\t2.0\n*(Schafer and Pekoz, 1998a), **(Wang et al., 2006), ***(Batista, 1988;

The numerical analyses are performed to columns, beams and beam-columns. Also, new design methodologies are proposed as the analysis made showed the need of new design adjustments, from previous conclusions. This prediction for the fire design of cold-formed steel members is important because the actual calculation rules seem to be over conservative.\n6.2\tColumns\nIn the present section, the adopted column model from Chapter 5 is applied and after obtained the respective resistance values, for different cross-section types (lippedchannel (C) and sigma (E) sections) and different steel grades. New methodologies are analysed and proposed in this section in order to cover as many cases as possible not being over conservative but remaining in the safe side.\nHere are presented the different methodologies applied as well as the New Proposals for the different analysis. The applied methodologies are based on the EC3 design rules. The \u201cEN1993-1-2\u201d is referred to the current Part 1-2 of the EC3 general rules, for elements under compression action considering the load eccentricity and the Annex E considerations for Class 4 cross-sections. The \u201cEN1993-1-2 FNA\u201d is referred to the Part 1-2 of the EC3 considering the FN Annex assumptions for cold-formed crosssections. \u201cNew Proposals\u201d correspond to the differences applied on the previous Methodologies. \u201cNew Proposal a-0,65\u201d is tested for lipped-channel and sigma crosssections and consists on considering the a factor from the EC3 general rules for fire. However, a new proposal is presented (\u201cNew Proposal a-0,40\u201d) particularly for sigma cross-sections that presents a better approximation to these numerical results that consists on modifying the constant value from a factor 0,65 to 0,40. Afterwards, a statistical analysis is performed to evaluate the accuracy of the different Methodologies and New Proposals.\n6.2.1\tNew simplified calculation proposals\nTable 6.1 presents the different Methodologies and also the New Proposals for the different case studies.\nTable 6.1- Equations for axial compression of cold-formed profiles under fire conditions\nEN1993-1-2\tEN1993-1-2 FNA\tNew Proposal a-0,65\tNew Proposal a-0,40*\nReduction factor for the flexural buckling in fire design situation\t\t\t\n\t\t1\t\n\t1 Ve + J(Ve )2 - (Xe 7\t\t\nNon-dimensional slenderness for lateral-torsional buckling in the fire design situation\t\t\t\nXe\n= X\nk\ntto,2,p,e\nkE,e\n\nCoefficient for determining the reduction factor\nVe = 2[1 + aXe + (Xe 7 ]\tVe = \u20141 + a(Xe - 0,2)+ (Xe)2]\t\t\nImperfection factor\t\t\t\na = 0,65 \u2014\ta = 0,34 (curve b)\ta = 0,65 \u2014\t\u00a1235 a = 0,40 I235\n* Only for sigma (S) cross-sections\nIn \u201cNew Proposal a-0,65\u201d, the coefficient for determining the reduction factor from FN Annex is considered and the imperfection factor is obtained applying the imperfection factor expression from Part 1-2 of the EC3.

The same does not happen when for the same numerical results are applied the different methodologies of both annexes.\nFrom Figure 6.3 there are clear differences. The design rules from Part 1-2 of EC3 (EN1993-1-2) are over conservative, but the design rules from the FN Annex of Part 12 of EC3 (EN1993-1-2 FNA) have a range of unsafe results. The New Proposal balances the previous differences where the results are closer to the new curve but on the safe side.\nFigure 6.4 and Figure 6.5 show the same analysis considering different lipped-channel cross-sections.\nf =355MPa\nEM 993-1-2\nOSAFIR 350 \u00b0C\nA SAFIR 500 \"C\nSAFIR 500 \u00b0C\nA SAFIR 500 \u00b0C\nSAFIR 600 \u00b0C\nOSAFIR 600\u00b0C\nNew Proposal q-0,65 OSAFIR 350\u00b0C\nEM 993-1-2\nFNA\nSAFIR 35O\u00b0C\nConstitutive Law\nFigure 6.4 - Methodologies from EN 1993-1-2 and New Proposal results with the FN Annex Constitutive Law for C_155x77x31x(2.0) columns\nOSAFIR 600\u00b0C\n4o 4*^\t4)0\t4.0 A. /s\t4>o A\t4do\n4o\t4)0\t4)0\t4)0\t4)0\n2.00\n0.00\n0.00\nC_100x50xl0x(1.6)\n1.80\n1.60\n1.40\n1.20\n1.00\n0.80\n0.60\n0.40\n0.20\n^SAEIR\nfy=355MPa\n\tEN 1993-1-2\tEN1993-1-2\tNew Proposal FNA\ta-0,65\n\tOSAFIR 350\u00b0C\tSAFIR 350\u00b0C OSAFIR 350\u00b0C A SAFIR 500 \u00b0C\tSAFIR 500\u00b0C ASAFIR 500%:\n\tOSAFIR 600\u00b0C\tSAFIR 600 \u00b0C OSAFIR 600%:\n\tSafe\na\t*\t\u00a3\t\u00b0\tzbo\n\tZbO\tA) O\n\tUnsafe\n\t\nf=3S5MPa\tConstitutive Law EN 1993-1-2 (FN Annex)\t\n1\tC_100x50xl0x(1.6)\t\n0.20\n0 40\n0.60\n0 80\n1.00\n1 20\n1 40\n1 60\nA\n2.8\n2.00\nFigure 6.5 - Methodologies from EN 1993-1-2 and New Proposal results with the FN Annex Constitutive Law for C_100x50x10x(1.6) columns\nFrom the results shown in Figure 6.3, Figure 6.4 and Figure 6.5, on one hand is visible how over conservative are the rules from the EN1993-1-2 for the three cases. The opposite occurs for the rules from EN1993-1-2 FNA, where most of the values are on the unsafe side. The \u201cNew Proposal a-0,65\u201d shows a better approximation to the numerical results for any different cross-section\u2019s dimensions.\nThe following charts consider different steel grades (Figure 6.6 and Figure 6.7).\nEM 993-1-2\nOSAFIR 350 \u00b0C\nA SAFIR 500 \u00b0C\nSAFIR 500 \u00b0C\nA SAFIR 500 \u00b0C\nOSAFIR 600\u00b0C\nSAFIR 600 \u00b0C\nOSAFIR 600\u00b0C\nfy=280MPa\nNew Proposal a-0,65\nOSAFIR 350\u00b0C\nEN 1993-1-2 FNA\nSAFIR 350 \u00b0C\nFigure 6.6 - Methodologies from EN 1993-1-2 and New Proposal results with the FN Annex Constitutive Law for C_229x64x20x(1.5) and fy = 280MPa columns\nEN1993-1-2\nO SAFIR 350 \u00b0C\nA SAFIR 500 \u00b0C\nSAFIR 500 \u00b0C A SAFIR 500 \u00b0C\nO SAFIR 600\u00b0C\tSAFIR 600 \u00b0C O SAFIR 600 \u00b0C\nfy=460MPa\nEMI993-1-2\tNew Proposal\nFNA\ta-0,65\nSAFIR 350 \u00b0C O SAFIR 350 \u00b0C\nfv=460MPa\n0.40\nEN 1993-1-2 (FN Annex)\n0.20\nC 229x64x20x(1.5)\n0.20\n0.40\n0.60\n0.80\n0.00 I\u2014\n0.00\nFigure 6.7 - Methodologies from EN 1993-1-2 and New Proposal results with the FN Annex Constitutive Law for C_229x64x20x(1.5) and fy _ 460MPa columns\nThe influence of the different steel grades is visible. Considering a low steel grade the numerical results are far from the EC3 rules, being the approximation improved when the steel grade increases. The EN1993-1-2 stills being over conservative, but the EN1993-1-2 FNA tends to be increasingly insecure for the results (Figure 6.5, Figure\n6.6,\tFigure 6.7). New Proposal a-0,65 balances these differences being often on the safe side, where the unsafe results occur for the limit range of steel grade.\nThe average value (p) and the standard deviation (s) are important values in the statistical analysis for the different methodologies of Part 1-2 from EC3 and different New Proposals that are obtained for each analysis performed.\nFor each analysed curve it is possible to evaluate the ratio between the analytical value and the corresponding SAFIR value:\nAnalytical x _ Rult,i Xi _\tSAFIR\nRult,i\nThe average value p is obtained by:\nzr=1xj\n(6.1)\n(6.2)\nAnd the standard deviation s is given by:\ns\n= Jsr=i(xi- r)2\nn- 1\n(6.3)\nwith n, the total number of considered numerical simulations.\nThe following criteria for validation were considered:\n1.\tThe calculation results shall not be on the unsafe side by more than 15% of the SAFIR results;\n2.\tA maximum of 20% of individual calculation results is acceptable to be on the unsafe side;\n3.\tThe mean value of all percentage differences between calculation results and SAFIR results shall be on the safe side.\nConsidering n=330 as the total number of numerical simulations taking into account the Annex E Constitutive Law and other 330 numerical simulations considering the FN Annex Constitutive Law, Table 6.2 shows the average value and the standard deviation for the ratio between the different design rules, analytical approaches and the numerical results for lipped channel sections.\nTable 6.2 - Statistical evaluation for lipped channel columns at high temperatures\nDesign rule\tAverage value (u)\tStandard deviation (s)\tM\u00e1x.

Also, the standard deviation is high. However, the EN1993-1-2 FNA presents a large percentage of non-safety results (58%) despite an average value closer to 1 and a lower standard deviation. The percentage of unsafe results for \u201cNew Proposal a-0,65\u201d significantly decreases to 18%. The average value is closer to 1 and with a low standard deviation.\nSince the values of the statistical analysis and respective criteria for validation are on the limit of safety, the analysis for \u201cNew Proposal a-0,40\u201d does not make any sense. The results for this New Proposal would be too unsafe.\n6.2.2.2\tSigma sections (X)\nThe following results are related to the different sigma sections analysed cases (Figure\n6.8\tand Figure 6.9). The same procedure and analysis made for lipped channel sections is also here performed. A New Proposal (New Proposal a-0,40) is here analysed, developed specially for this type of cross-section shape (Figure 6.10, Figure 6.11).\nFigure 6.8 - Numerical results considering the EN 1993-1-2 and Annex E Constitutive Law for L_229x64x20x(1.5) columns\nfy=355MPa\n\tEN1993-1-2\n\tSAFIR 350 \u00b0C A SAFIR 500 \u00b0C\n\t\u25a0SAFIR 600\"C\n\tSafe A\u00f3\t* %\tAO\n\t\nr\t\n\tUnsafe\nfy=355MPa\t\nL X_229x64x20x(1.5)\tConstitutive Law EN 1993-1-2\n\t\nE_229x64x20x(1.5)\nfy=355MPa\nEN 1993-1-2 FNA\n\u2022\u00bf\u2022SAFIR 350\u00aeC\nA SAFIR 500 \u00b0C\nSAFIR 600\"C\nFigure 6.9 - Numerical results considering the EN 1993-1-2 FNA and the respective Constitutive Law for L_229x64x20x(1.5) columns\nFrom the previous results shown, they are always on the safe side for sigma crosssections. \u201cEN1993-1-2\u201d demonstrated to be more conservative for these cases (Figure 6.8).

The \u201cEN1993-1-2\u201d is over conservative, the \u201cEN1993-1-2 FNA\u201d\npresents a significant improvement for the results, being these closer to the curve\n(Figure 6.12 and Figure 6.13). Nevertheless, \u201cNew Proposal a-0,40\u201d gives a good\napproximation to the numerical results guaranteeing the safety required.\nConsidering n=150 as the total number of numerical simulations for Annex E Constitutive Law and n=150 for FN Annex Constitutive Law, Table 6.3 shows the average value and the standard deviation for the ratio between the different design rules, analytical approaches and the numerical results for sigma sections.\nTable 6.3 - Statistical evaluation for sigma columns at high temperatures\nDesign rule\tAverage value (u)\tStandard deviation (s)\tM\u00e1x.

Also, the standard deviation is high. However, the EN1993-1-2 FNA presents a very good agreement with the numerical results, with an average value closer to 1 and a lower standard deviation. With the New Proposal a-0,65, the method remains over conservative. Therefore, the New Proposal a-0,40 shows a better agreement with the numerical results, having an average value closer to 1 and a low standard deviation, despite the not significant increase of unsafe results from 3% to 9% when compared with \u201cEN1993-1-2 FNA\u201d.\nIn general, the EN1993-1-2 design rules are over conservative and this is visible for both lipped channel and sigma sections, from columns. For sigma cross-sections this difference is more evident. On the other hand, for \u201cEN1993-1-2 FNA\u201d the same does not happens in the same way. The results are closer to the Eurocode curve but are on the unsafe side (in some cases 58% of the numerical results). Therefore, a new methodology is developed to balance those differences, where the results are closer to the Eurocode curve but on the safe side in almost all cases.\nConsidering different cross-sections types and dimensions, the conclusions of the analysis are the same. For different steel grades it is possible to obtain the same conclusions with the particularity of having an imperfection factor that depends on the yield strength. The numerical results demonstrated the importance of this adjustment which is not very evident but important for the accuracy of the Eurocode curve. With the New Proposal a-0,65, the method remains over conservative for sigma. Therefore, the New Proposal a-0,40 shows a better agreement with the numerical results, with a small increase of unsafe results.\n6.3\tBeams\nIn the current chapter section, the adopted beam model is going to be presented and also the respective analysis, for different cross-section types (lipped channel (C) sections and sigma (S) sections), different steel grades a different bending moments diagrams (uniform and non-uniform moments) comparing the results with the actual design rules. As performed for the column elements, new methodologies are analysed and proposed in this part. The different methodologies are studied and New Proposals developed, based on the EC3 design rules, for the different analysis.\nThe \u201cEN1993-1-2\u201d, in the same way as for the columns, is referred to the current Part 1-2 of the EC3 general rules, for elements under bending action and the Annex E considerations for Class 4 cross-sections. The \u201cEN1993-1-2 FNA\u201d is referred to the Part 1-2 of the EC3 considering the FN Annex considerations for Class 4 or cold-formed cross-sections. \u201cNew Proposals\u201d correspond to the differences applied on the previous Methodologies, as referred for columns. After, a statistical analysis is performed to evaluate the accuracy of the different Part 1-2 of the EC3 methodologies and New Proposals.\n6.3.1\tNew simplified calculation proposals\nSimilar to Table 6.1, Table 6.4 presents the different Methodologies and also the New Proposals for the different beam case studies. New Proposals consider the FN Annex Constitutive Law as already considered for columns.\nAccording to Vila Real et al. (2007), and from previous conclusions, the shape of the moment diagram also affects the value of the lateral-torsional buckling resistance moment. A beneficial effect results from reduced plastic zones connected by variable bending along the beam can be considered at high temperatures, applying a factor f in function of the shape of the bending moment diagram.\nCouto et al. (2015) proposed the introduction of a limit value for this factor, in case of Class 4 sections in fire conditions, which improved the results for bi-triangular bending diagrams (y= -1).\nTable 6.4- Equations for bending moment of cold-formed profiles under fire conditions\nEN1993-1-2\nEN1993-1-2 FNA\nNew Proposal a-0,65\nNew Proposal a-0,40\nReduction factor for the flexural buckling in fire design situation\n________1_______\nPe +J(Pe I' - (\u00c0e f\nNon-dimensional slenderness for lateral-torsional buckling in the fire design situation\n\u00c0e\nko,2, p,e kE,e\n= \u00c0\nModified reduction factor\nNo modified reduction factor applied\nXfi,mod = Y &lt;1.0\n&lt;= 1 - 0,5(1 - C*) > 0,8 *\nC* = 0.15a2 + 0.3a + 0.6 &lt;1.0 **\nCoefficient for determining the reduction factor\nEC3 + Annex E\tEC3 + FN Annex\t\t\npe = 21 + a~- + (\u00c0e f ]\tPe = 21 + a(\u00c0e - 0,2) + (\u00c0e f ]\t\t\nImperfection factor\t\t\t\na = 0,65 \u00cd235 Uy\ta = 0\u201934 (curve b)\t1235 a = 0,65 I235\t1235 a = 0,40 U\n* Equation limit proposed by Couto (2015) for Class 4 sections ** Modified reduction factor proposed by Vila Real et al.

The coefficient from FN Annex, for determining the reduction factor, is considered and the imperfection factor is obtained applying the imperfection factor expression from Part 1-2 of the EC3 (also at \u201cNew Proposal a-0,40\u201d with an adjustment). All the main formulation of Part 1-2 from EC3 remains.\nConsidering the previous analysis and conclusions about the numerical models behaviour, New Proposals consider the FN Annex Constitutive Law.\n6.3.2\tComparisons between numerical results and simplified calculation rules\n6.3.2.1\tLipped channel sections (C)\nHere are presented the results related to the different lipped channel beam sections analysed.

The existence of a plateau in the beginning of the buckling curve is clearly needed (New Proposal a-0,65) but not enough (Figure 6.16 and Figure 6.17).

The application of a modified reduction factor on the design methodology is important, as shown on Figure 6.20 and Figure 6.21. The results are clearly closer to the \u201cNew Proposal a-0,40\u201d and on the safe side.\nFigure 6.20 - EN1993-1-2 FNA and New Proposals results with the EN 1993-1-2 FN Annex Constitutive Law for C_229x64x20x(1.5) and y= 0 beams\nFigure 6.21 - EN1993-1-2 FNA and New Proposals results with the EN 1993-1-2 FN Annex Constitutive Law for C_229x64x20x(1.5) and y= -1 beams\nFigure 6.22 shows the accuracy of the design prescriptions of EN1993-1-2, EN1993-\n1-2 FNA and the New Proposals, for lipped channel sections, considering y=1 numerical results.\nc)\td)\nFigure 6.22 - EN1993-1-2, EN1993-1-2 FNA, New Proposal a-0,65, New Proposal a-0,40 and numerical results for lipped channel sections, considering ^=1 numerical results\nThe total number of considered numerical simulations is 510 (k = 255 with the EN1993-1-2 parameters and also n = 255 with the EN1993-1-2 FNA parameters, considered for the statistical evaluation).\nTable 6.5 shows the average value and the standard deviation for the ratio between the different design rules, analytical approaches and the numerical results for lipped channel sections.\nTable 6.5 - Statistical evaluation for lipped channel beams at high temperatures\nDesign rule\tAverage value (u)\tStandard deviation (s)\tM\u00e1x.

Despite the percentage of unsafe results for the \u201cNew Proposal a-0,40\u201d, this New Proposal is closer to the numerical results obtained.\nThe \u201cEN1993-1-2\u201d design rules are over conservative and this is visible for both crosssection\u2019s shapes, from beams. For sigma cross-sections this difference is more evident, as also concluded for columns. For \u201cEN1993-1-2 FNA\u201d the curve is really closer to the numerical results, but for non-uniform bending diagrams the curve revels to be over conservative. Therefore, a new methodology is developed to balance the registered differences, where the results are closer to the buckling curve, not always on the safe side.\nConsidering different cross-sections types, different dimensions and different steel grades, the conclusions of the analysis are the same. For different steel grades it is possible the particularity of having an imperfection factor that depends on the yield strength. The numerical results demonstrated the importance of this adjustment which is quite evident and important for the accuracy of the buckling curve.\nWith the \u201cNew Proposal a-0,65\u201d, the method remains over conservative. Therefore, the \u201cNew Proposal a-0,40\u201d shows a better agreement with the numerical results, with low unsafe results.\n6.4\tBeam-columns\nIn this section, the adopted beam-column model and the respective analysis with lipped channel and sigma sections are presented. Different temperatures and steel grades are analysed for one case of each cross-section type to understand the element behaviour in function of these parameters. Different loading types considering different bending moment diagrams are also analysed for different slendernesses. The comparison of the results with the actual design rules is also performed, being necessary to develop new design proposals for these elements.\nA \u201cNew Proposal\u201d was developed for beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling (adjusting the actual tc expression) and considering the lateral torsional buckling (adjusting the current expression). The statistical analysis demonstrates the need of developing and the adoption of this new methodology, which is presented in this section.\n6.4.1\tNew simplified calculation proposals\nConsidering the New Proposals from columns and beams, presented on 6.2.1 and 6.3.1 respectively, the New Proposal for beam-columns adds new coefficients to determine interaction factors and consequently to obtain less conservative design rules.\nThe adjustment for beam-columns under fire conditions and without lateral torsional buckling, on the current tc expression, is presented on Figure 6.34 to Figure 6.36 for the different bending moment diagrams. There is shown the evolution of tc in function of the slenderness with the proposed modifications given on Table 6.9. The \u201cLinear (SAFIR)\u201d represents the behaviour of the main values of each parameter analysed by the SAFIR software.\nFrom this analysis, it is possible to observe that the current py is appropriated for the presented numerical results. Since the results for very small lengths and non-uniform bending results are very conservative and due to the lack of different cases, the expression\u2019s limit value is increased from 0,9 to 1,1 as analysed on Figure 6.34 to Figure 6.36 to keep it safe.\nFigure 6.34 - Variation of the factor py of lipped-channel beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling for y=1\nFigure 6.35 - Variation of the factor py of lipped-channel beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling for y=0\nEN 1993-1-2 ----New Proposal gy\nX SAFIR\n- Lineal (SAFIR)\nFigure 6.36 - Variation of the factor py of lipped-channel beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling for y= -1\nAs performed for lipped-channel sections, the adjustment of the current ^y expression is presented on Figure 6.37 to Figure 6.39, referred to sigma sections, for the different bending moment diagrams. There is shown the evolution of in function of the slenderness with the proposed modifications.\nFrom this analysis, it is possible to observe that the current ^y is appropriated for the presented numerical results. Since the results for very small lengths and non-uniform bending results are very conservative, the expression\u2019s limit value is increased from 0,9 to 1,1 as analysed on Figure 6.37 to Figure 6.39\nFigure 6.37 - Variation of the factor py of sigma beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling for y=1\nFigure 6.38 - Variation of the factor py of sigma beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling for y=0\nA\nEN 1993-1-2\n----New Proposalpy\nX SAFER\n----Linear (SAFER.)\nFigure 6.39 - Variation of the factor py of sigma beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling for y= -1\nThe previous conclusions demonstrated that the shape of the bending diagram affects the value of the element\u2019s resistance. Besides the &lt;factor in function of the shape of the bending moment diagram, the beam-column\u2019s slenderness also changes de interaction curve (M-N) behaviour.\nTable 6.9 - Equations for combined bending and axial compression of cold-formed profiles under fire conditions without lateral torsional buckling\nEN1993-1-2\tEN1993-1-2 FNA\tNew Proposal\nInteraction factors\t\t\nky = 1\tmyNfi\u2019Ed\t&lt;3 C A k\tf M,fi^eff^0,2,p,6 g JMfi\tkyy = 1\tky = 1\tmyNfiEd f &lt;3 ^y,Aeffko.2.P.e~~ 'Mft\nCoefficients to determining the interaction factors\t\t\nP = (2pM,y - 5)ly, + 0,44\t+ 0,29 but my \u00a3 0,8\t-\tPy = (2Pm,y - 5)lq + 0,44 Pm,y + 0,29 but my &lt;1,1\nAlthough the relatively good results for uniform moments, already considering the New Proposals developed for beams and columns, the results for non-uniform moments were not as good as the previous. Therefore, only changing the limit of the coefficients to determining the interaction factors (py) from 0,8 to 1,1, the problem is solved by simplifying the solution and the safety is remained.\nThe adjustment for beam-columns under fire conditions and with lateral torsional buckling, on the current liw expression, is presented on Figure 6.40 to Figure 6.42, also for the different bending moment diagrams. The evolution of liw in function of the slenderness with the modified propose from Table 6.10 is shown for lipped-channel cross-sections.\nFigure 6.40 - Variation of the factor pLT of lipped-channel beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling for y=1\nFigure 6.41 - Variation of the factor pLT of lipped-channel beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling for y=0\nFigure 6.42 - Variation of the factor pLT of lipped-channel beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling for y= -1\nAnalysing the charts from Figure 6.40 to Figure 6.42, it is possible to observe the small adjustment to perform to the current \u00bflt expression that is necessary to present a better agreement with the numerical results.\nAnd here is the adjustment of the current \u00bflt expression analysed for sigma crosssections (see Figure 6.43 to Figure 6.45).\nFigure 6.43 - Variation of the factor pLT of sigma beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling for y=1\nFigure 6.44 - Variation of the factor pLT of sigma beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling for y=0\n.5\n----New Proposal pLT\nX SAFIR\n----Linear (SAFIR)\n2.0\nFigure 6.45 - Variation of the factor pLT of sigma beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling for y= -1\n\t\t\t\tX\n\t\t\tX\t\n-\t\t\t\tX\t\tX\t\n\tX\tX \t\tx\t\tX\tX\n\t\t\t\u25a0 ? \u2014\t\u2014L2i\u2014\nConsidering the performed beam-columns analysis taking or not taking into account the lateral torsional buckling, all the main formulation from beams and columns \u201cNew Proposals\u201d remains, introducing a new my and mLT on the final \u201cNew Proposal\u201d. The FN Annex Constitutive Law is also considered in the \u201cNew Proposal\u201d.\nTable 6.10 - Equations for combined bending and axial compression of cold-formed profiles under fire conditions with lateral torsional buckling\nEN1993-1-2\tEN1993-1-2 FNA\tNew Proposal uit\nInteraction factors\t\t\nkT = 1\t\u00a3 1 Xz.fA;ffk0,2.p,e g hifi\tkzy = 1\tkLT = 1\t'\tf \u00a3 1 Xz.fi^Aeff^O,2.p,0 g hifl\nCoefficients to determining the interaction factors\t\t\nmLT = 0,15lz,eftMiT - 0.15 \u00a3 0,9\t-\tmLT = 0,3Olz,0pMTT -0,15\u00a3 0,25\n6.4.2\tComparisons between numerical results and simplified calculation rules without lateral torsional buckling\n6.4.2.1\tLipped channel sections (C)\nFor the lipped channel sections without lateral torsional buckling case, the results are presented bellow considering the different parameters. The first presented results represent the temperature factor, compared with the design methodology corresponded to the Part 1-2 from EC3, considering the Annex E Constitutive Law (Figure 6.46).\nSince these are not buckling curves because there is a case of axial compression combined with a bending moment (due to the mono-symmetric cross-sections geometry), the charts Eurocode curves always start at 1 on the y-axis. Also, because there is no lateral torsional buckling, the kLT will always be equal to 1 and therefore the same chart ends in 1 on the x-axis.\nFigure 6.46 - EN1993-1-2 results with Annex E Constitutive Law for C_229x64x20x(1.5) beamcolumns without lateral torsional buckling for high temperatures a) 350 \u00b0C, b) 500 \u00b0C and c) 600 \u00b0C\nTo compare the previous results with the different methodologies here analysed, Figure\n6.47 and Figure 6.48 present respectively the results taken into account the FN Annex and the New Proposal.\nFigure 6.47 - EN1993-1-2 FNA results with FN Annex Constitutive Law for C_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling for high temperatures: a) 350 \u00b0C, b) 500 \u00b0C and c) 600 \u00b0C\nFigure 6.48 - New Proposal results with the New Proposal curve where FN Annex Constitutive Law is considered for C_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling for high temperatures: a) 350 \u00b0C, b) 500 \u00b0C and c) 600 \u00b0C\nAlso, the study about the steel grade influence is presented in Figure 6.49 and Figure\n6.50 for the different methodologies that consider the FN Annex Constitutive Law.\nFigure 6.49 - EN1993-1-2 FNA results with FN Annex Constitutive Law for C_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling for different steel grades: a) S280, b) S320 and c) S460\nFigure 6.50 - New Proposal results with the New Proposal curve where FN Annex Constitutive Law is considered for C_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling for different steel grades, a) S280, b) S320 and c) S460\nThe presented results show the differences between the different methodologies. The general rules from Part 1-2 of EC3 are one more time conservatives as visible in (Figure 6.46) and for all the different parameters analysed (as presented in Chapter 5).\nThe FN Annex presents an improvement as presented on Figure 6.47 and Figure 6.49 but the interaction curve seems to be inadequate. Otherwise, if considered the assumptions of the New Proposals for beams and columns are taken into account with the shape of the curve of the general calculation rules the results revealed to be closer to the new interaction curve (see Figure 6.48 and Figure 6.50).\nFor different lengths the results with the FN Annex are also presented and compared with the results considering the New Proposal on Figure 6.51 and Figure 6.52.\nFigure 6.51 - EN1993-1-2 FNA results with FN Annex Constitutive Law for C_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling for different lengths: a) L=3.0m, b) L=5.0m and c) L=10.0m\nFigure 6.52 - New Proposal results with the New Proposal curve where FN Annex Constitutive Law is considered for C_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling for different lengths: a) L=3.0m, b) L=5.0m and c) L=10.0m\nThe New Proposal has a better behaviour according to the numerical results, but sometimes still being conservative (increasing the element length). The results are also safer when compared with the FN Annex results.\nFor non-uniform bending moments, the results represent the values for y=0 and for\nY= -1 on Figure 6.53 to Figure 6.56.\nFigure 6.53 - EN1993-1-2 FNA results with FN Annex Constitutive Law for C_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling for y=0, a) L=1.5m, b) L=5.0m and c) L=10.0m\nFigure 6.54 - New Proposal results with the New Proposal curve where FN Annex Constitutive Law is considered for C_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling for y=0: a) L=1.5m, b) L=5.0m and c) L=10.0m\nFigure 6.55 - EN1993-1-2 FNA results with FN Annex Constitutive Law for C_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling for y=-1: a) L=1.5m, b) L=5.0m and c) L=10.0m\nFigure 6.56 - New Proposal results with the New Proposal curve where FN Annex Constitutive Law is considered for C_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling for y=-1: a) L=1.5m, b) 5.0m and c) 10.0m\nNew Proposal curve is better adjusted to the numerical results as it is possible to observe. For very small lengths the New Proposal continues to be very conservative. For superior lengths the curve has a better behaviour, closer to the numerical results and at the same time on the safe side. The buckling curve shape from the FN Annex, due to consider the k equal to 1, is not the most recommended. The statistical analysis is performed and the results of the average value, standard deviation and unsafe values are presented on Table 6.11 for uniform bending moments and on Table 6.12 for the different bending diagrams.\nTable 6.11 - Statistical evaluation for a lipped-channel beam-column section without lateral torsional at high temperatures considering k = 1 numerical results\nDesign rule\tAverage value (u)\tStandard deviation (s)\tMax.

For \u201cEN1993-1-2 FNA\u201d the rules are closer to the numerical results, but for small steel grades and high slendernesses some of the results are on the unsafe part. Therefore, a new methodology is considered to adapt the shape of the interaction M-N curves to the numerical results behaviour, depending on the slenderness of the elements, the steel grade and on the bending diagram. The New Proposal presents the best agreement with the numerical results, providing at the same time safety.\n6.4.2.2\tSigma sections (X)\nIn this case, the study of beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling is performed for sigma cross-section analysing the same parameters as analysed for lipped-channel sections. The results from Figure 6.57 are the results of the numerical analysis considering the Annex E Constitutive Law and the comparison with the current Part 1-2 from EC3 interaction curve.\nFigure 6.57 - EN1993-1-2 results with Annex E Constitutive Law for E_229x64x20x(1.5) beamcolumns without lateral torsional buckling for high temperatures a) 350 \u00b0C, b) 500 \u00b0C and c) 600 \u00b0C\nThe FN Annex from Part 1-2 of EC3 interaction curve is analysed (Figure 6.58) as well as the New Proposal (Figure 6.59) for different temperatures.\nFigure 6.58 - EN1993-1-2 FNA results with FN Annex Constitutive Law for L_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling for high temperatures: a) 350 \u00b0C, b) 500 \u00b0C and c) 600 \u00b0C\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n+ I\u00e7AM/M^jRd\n1.2\n\to SAFIR \u2014New Proposal py\n\t\n\u25a0X.\t\n\t\nV=1 350 \u00b0C L=1.0m\t\nt=355MPa E_229x64x20\t\n0.2\t0.4\t0.6\t0.8\na)\nFigure 6.59 - New Proposal results with the New Proposal curve where FN Annex Constitutive Law is considered for L_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling for high temperatures: a) 350 \u00b0C, b) 500 \u00b0C and c) 600 \u00b0C\n0\n0\nAnalysing different steel grades, Figure 6.60 and Figure 6.61 present the influence of this parameter for both methodologies (FN Annex and New Proposal).\nFigure 6.60 - EN1993-1-2 FNA results with FN Annex Constitutive Law for L_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling for different steel grades: a) S280, b) S320 and c) S460\nFigure 6.61 - New Proposal results with the New Proposal curve where FN Annex Constitutive Law is considered for L_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling for different steel grades: a) S280, b) S320 and c) S460\nThe current design rules continue to demonstrate to be conservative and the FN Annex curve does not present a similar behaviour closer to the corresponding numerical results. New Proposal adopted for lipped-channel sections seems to agree with this analysis results. However, some of the values are on the unsafe side.\nVarying the element length, the results are showed in Figure 6.62 and Figure 6.63.\nFigure 6.62 - EN1993-1-2 FNA results with FN Annex Constitutive Law for L_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling for different lengths: a) L=3.0m, b) L=7.0m and c) L=10.0m\nFigure 6.63 - New Proposal results with the New Proposal curve where FN Annex Constitutive Law is considered for L_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling for different lengths: a) L=3.0m, b) L=7.0m and c) L=10.0m\nWith FN Annex methodology the results are clearly on the unsafe side (Figure 6.62).

Therefore the \u201cNew Proposal\u201d is in better agreement with the results. Comparing the results from sigma sections and lipped-channel sections, the new interaction curve presents better results for lipped-channel sections.\n6.4.3\tComparisons between numerical results and simplified calculation rules with lateral torsional buckling\n6.4.3.1\tLipped channel sections (C)\nFor lipped channel beam-columns sections, considering the lateral buckling effect, the results are here presented for the different analysed parameters. As previous presented, the first charts represent the results and the design methodology corresponded to the Part 1-2 from EC3, considering the Annex E Constitutive Law (Figure 6.68) and for different temperatures. For these cases, there is still a case of axial compression combined with a bending moment (due to the mono-symmetric cross-sections geometry), so the charts Eurocode curves always start at 1 on the y-axis. But, considering the lateral torsional buckling, the kLT depends on the element slenderness and will vary the value on the x-axis.\nFigure 6.68 - EN1993-1-2 results with EN 1993-1-2 Annex E Constitutive Law for C_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns with 1,5 m length and for high temperatures a) 350 \u00b0C, b) 500 \u00b0C and c) 600 \u00b0C\nThe following charts represent the results and the design methodology corresponded to\nthe Part 1-2 from EC3 considering the FN Annex considerations and the respective\nConstitutive Law (Figure 6.69).\nFigure 6.69 - EN1993-1-2 FNA results with EN 1993-1-2 FN Annex Constitutive Law for C_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns with 1,5 m length and for different steel grades: a) S280, b) S320 and c) S460\nAnd on the charts from Figure 6.70 are revealed the results considering the New Proposal.\nFigure 6.70 - New Proposal results with the New Proposal curve where FN Annex Constitutive Law is considered for C_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns with 1,5 m length and for different steel grades: a) S280, b) S320 and c) S460\nFrom the results presented above, the analyses show how over conservative the current design rules from Part 1-2 of EC3 are (Figure 6.68). As mentioned before, the FN Annex presents numerical results closer (Figure 6.69) but in some cases on the unsafe side. Therefore, considering all the considerations taken into account so far it is possible to obtain results less conservative than the current Part 1-2 of EC3 curve but on the safe side in general (Figure 6.70).\nFor different beam-columns lengths the results considering the FN Annex (Figure 6.71) are also presented and compared with the results considering the New Proposal (Figure 6.72).\no SAFIR\n\u2014EN1993-1-2 FNA\nV=1\n500 \u00b0C\nL=0.5m\n\u00c7=355MPa\nC_229x64x20\n1.2 ---------------------------------------\nFigure 6.71 - EN1993-1-2 FNA results with EN 1993-1-2 FN Annex Constitutive Law for C_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns for different lengths and for 500\u00b0 C results: a) L=0.5m, b) L=3.0m and c) L=5.0m\nN/Nb>n ,tRd +\tARd\n\to SAFIR \u2014EN1993-1-2 FNA\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\\\u00b0 \\\u00b0\t\t\n\ti\t O\tV=1 500 \u00b0C I \u2014 7 Am\n\t\\ o\tfy=355MPa \\\tC_229x64x20\t\n1 1.2\nM/Mnt-Rd\nN/Nbin t.Rd + kyzAM/Mjj) tRd\n\t\to SAFIR \u2014EN 1993-1-2 FNA\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\\o\t\t\nv> \\o\t\tV=1 500 \u00b0C\n\\ \u00b0\tfy=355MPa C_229x64x20\t\nFigure 6.72 - New Proposal results for C_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns for different lengths and for 500\u00b0 C results: a) L=0.5m, b) L=3.0m and c) L=5.0m\nFrom Figure 6.71 and Figure 6.72 is visible how the New Proposal has a better behaviour according to the numerical results. The results are safer, when compared with the FN Annex results (see a) from Figure 6.71 and Figure 6.72), and at the same time the shape of the curve is better adjusted (compare b) from Figure 6.71 and Figure 6.72).\nAlso from different bending diagrams (non-uniform bending moments) the results are analysed (Figure 6.73 to Figure 6.76).\nFigure 6.73 - EN1993-1-2 FNA results with EN 1993-1-2 FN Annex Constitutive Law for\nC_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns for f|/= 0: a) L=1.5m, b) L=3.0m and c) L=4.0m\n1.2 -------------------------------------\no SAFIR\n1 1.2\nM/Mn,.Rd\n\u2014New Proposal pLT\nV=0\n500 \u00b0C\nL=4.0m\n^=355MPa C_229x64x20\nFigure 6.74 - New Proposal results for C_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns for f|/= 0: a) L=1.5m, b) L=3.0m and c) L=4.0m\nFigure 6.75 - EN1993-1-2 FNA results with EN 1993-1-2 FN Annex Constitutive Law for C_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns for y= -1: a) L=1.5m, b) L=3.0m and c) L=4.0m\nFigure 6.76 - New Proposal results for C_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns for y= -1: a) L=1.5m, b) L=3.0m and c) L=4.0m\nThe results are closer to the New Proposal curves. As it is possible to observe, for very small lengths the New Proposal continues to be very conservative. However, these small lengths are not very common in real cases. For common lengths the curve has a better behaviour, closer to the numerical results and at the same time on the safe side.\nThe statistical analysis presented on Table 6.15 and Table 6.16 proves the last mentioned conclusion.\nTable 6.15 - Statistical evaluation for a lipped-channel beam-column section with lateral torsional at high temperatures considering k = 1 numerical results\nDesign rule\tAverage value (u)\tStandard deviation (s)\tMax.

The New Proposal is a good improvement of both Eurocode rules from the different annexes.\n6.4.3.2\tSigma sections (E)\nAs performed for lipped channel beam-columns sections, the same study for sigma sections was performed considering the lateral-torsional buckling.\nFigure 6.77 presents the results as well as the Part 1-2 from EC3, considering the Annex E Constitutive Law, design methodology for different temperatures. Also Figure 6.78 presents the results but considering the FN Annex and the respective constitutive law for the numerical analysis.\nFigure 6.77 - EN1993-1-2 results with EN 1993-1-2 Annex E Constitutive Law for E_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns with 1,0 m length and for high temperatures a) 350 \u00b0C, b) 500 \u00b0C and c) 600 \u00b0C\nFigure 6.78 - EN1993-1-2 FNA results with EN 1993-1-2 FN Annex Constitutive Law for E_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns with 1,0 m length and for high temperatures a) 350 \u00b0C, b) 500 \u00b0C and c) 600 \u00b0C\nConsidering the New Proposal conditions, the Eurocode curve and the results exhibit the characteristics presented on Figure 6.79.\nN/Nb>fW<IM + ktAM/M1/u.Rd\nO SAFIR\n\u2014New Proposal pLT\nV=1\n500 \u00b0C\nL=1.0m\n\u00c7=355MPa\nS_229x64x20\n1 1.2 M/Mn>uw\nN/Nb,n.t,Rd + k3M/Min.t.Rd\n\t\to SAFIR \u2014New Proposal pLT\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nv=l\t\\ 600 \u00b0C L-l.Om f)-355MPa S 229x64x20\t\t\nFigure 6.79 - New Proposal results with the New Proposal curve where FN Annex Constitutive Law is considered for E_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns with 1,0 m length and for high temperatures: a) 350 \u00b0C, b) 500 \u00b0C and c) 600 \u00b0C\nThe analyses continue to show how over conservative the current design rules from Part 1-2 of EC3 are. The FN Annex presents numerical results really closer. Therefore, considering all the considerations taken into account so far for the New Proposal it is possible to obtain results less conservative than the current Part 1-2 of EC3 curve but on the safe side in general as well as the FN Annex Methodology.\nThe steel grade is also one of the analysed parameters. The different steel grades results are presented on Figure 6.80 considering the FN Annex and the respective constitutive law and compared with the results considering the New Proposal (Figure 6.81).\nAs concluded before for lipped channel cross-sections, the current Part 1-2 of EC3 presents a very conservative solution. Again, the FN Annex demonstrated a very good correlation between the numerical results and the analytical expressions, although for other cases (as will be demonstrated) the FN Annex does not continue this correlation.\nFigure 6.80 - EN1993-1-2 FNA results with EN 1993-1-2 FN Annex Constitutive Law for L_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns with 1,0 m length and for different steel grades: a) S280, b) S320 and c) S460\nFigure 6.81 - New Proposal results with the New Proposal curve where FN Annex Constitutive Law is considered for L_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns with 1,0 m length and for different steel grades: a) S280, b) S320 and c) S460\nFor the different lengths are presented the comparison for different sigma crosssection's lengths (Figure 6.82) and the New Proposal results (Figure 6.83).\nFigure 6.82 - EN1993-1-2 FNA results with EN 1993-1-2 FN Annex Constitutive Law for L_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns with different lengths and for 500\u00b0 C results: a) L=0.5m, b) L=1.5m and c) L=3.0m\nFigure 6.83 - New Proposal results for E_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns for different lengths and for 500\u00b0 C results: a) L=0.5m, b) L=1.5m and c) L=3.0m\nFrom Figure 6.79, Figure 6.81 and Figure 6.83 is visible how the New Proposal has a very good behaviour accompanying the numerical results.\nAlso, from different bending diagrams (non-uniform bending moments) the results are analysed (Figure 6.84 to Figure 6.87) for three different lengths.\nFigure 6.84 - EN1993-1-2 FNA results with EN 1993-1-2 FN Annex Constitutive Law for\nE_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns for y= 0: a) L=1.0m, b) L=2.0m and c) L=3.0m\nFigure 6.85 - New Proposal results for E_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns for y= 0: a) L=1.0m, b) L=2.0m and c) L=3.0m\nFigure 6.86 - EN1993-1-2 FNA results with EN 1993-1-2 FN Annex Constitutive Law for E_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns for y= -1: a) L=1.0m, b) L=2.0m and c) L=3.0m\nFigure 6.87 - New Proposal results for E_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns for y= -1: a) L=1.0m, b) L=2.0m and c) L=3.0m\nThe results are closer to the New Proposal curves. As it is possible to observe from the non-linear bending moment diagram analysis, for very small lengths the New Proposal continues to be very conservative. The results are not as close as the lipped channel section results from the New Proposal curve in the present case but they are on the safe side as the presented at the statistical analysis of Table 6.17 and Table 6.18.\nTable 6.17 - Statistical evaluation for a lipped-channel beam-column section with lateral torsional at high temperatures considering k = 1 numerical results\nDesign rule\tAverage value (u)\tStandard deviation (s)\tMax.

It was possible to observe that the FN Annex is less conservative than the Annex E, having the first a better agreement with the numerical results.\nNew methodologies for the design of cold-formed steel members were presented.

The FN Annex design rules present in some cases a really good approximation to the numerical results, but a shape not adequate to them, being sometimes over conservatives and other times unsafe, due to the simplicity and simplifications that are allowed by the rules for cold-formed steel members.\nFinal considerations and future work\n7\tFinal considerations and future work\n7.1\tConclusions\n7.2\tFuture work\n7\tFinal considerations and future work\n7.1\tConclusions\nThe performed work in the present thesis had the concern to study and deepen the knowledge about cold-formed steel structural members developing simplified design methodologies for lipped-channel and sigma cross-sections in case of fire.\nFirst, it was performed an introduction to cold-formed profiles behaviour at fire conditions, addressing fundamental concepts about structural stability of cold-formed steel elements.\nA numerical study on the behaviour of different cold-formed steel elements was presented. The numerical models were created based on experimental tests performed by different authors.\nFrom the experimental tests numerical modelling it was concluded that it is important to consider the real imperfections of the cold-formed elements. However, since is not always possible to measure the real initial geometric imperfections, for practical reasons the geometric imperfections magnitudes from the EN1090-2 tolerances should be considered to be always on the safe side.\nThe more complex the structural setup is, more difficult is to create a more realistic numerical model. It is important to consider as many experimental information as possible, being reasonable to not introduce too much entropy into the model analysis.\nFor elevated temperatures the differences between the numerical and the experimental tests increased. Considering more variables on a numerical analysis increases the differences.\nConsidering the FN Annex constitutive law for the numerical simulations of cold-formed steel profiles, it provides better results when compared with the results analysed with the constitutive law of EN1993-1-2 and respective Annex E. The numerical results and the member's fire behaviour are more realistic when making this consideration.\nIn the end, it was observed a good correlation between the experimental and numerical results, validating the numerical model applied in this study.\nThe obtained results at normal temperatures, for the determination of elastic instability critical loads and modes shape, were compared using FEM analysis with CAST3M and RUBY interface with those obtained by FSM through CUFSM.\nAn extensive parametric study of the lateral-torsional buckling behaviour of simply supported members with cold-formed sections in case of fire was performed, considering the influence of different temperatures, steel grades, cross-section slenderness and loading types.\nFrom this analysis is notorious the big influence the geometric imperfections have on the members fire resistance. It is important to consider all the geometric imperfections combined.\nThe imperfections are variable for different cross-sections, member types, loading types and for different boundary conditions. Therefore, a previous analysis must be done to consider each imperfection and combination.\nThe influence of the residual stresses is low at high temperatures and minimal when combined with the geometric imperfections. Flexural residual stresses revealed to be the most influent when compared with the membrane residual stresses. Nevertheless, both can be neglected for the numerical analysis.\nThe corner enhancement does not have a considerable impact on cold-formed members resistance. The Eurocode suggests the consideration of this improvement only for specific situations. Therefore, it is not relevant to take into account this parameter on cold-formed numerical models.\nEach cross-section member presents different resistance values. The behaviour between sections with the same shape is always similar, but one type shows their particular behaviour. However, it is always recommended to analyse and study each cross-section behaviour.\nPerforming the analysis of cold-formed profiles for different temperatures, the members behaviour is similar and the same conclusions can be obtained.\nThe steel grade is a parameter that should be taken into account on EC3 buckling curves. There are small differences but it should be considered for a better approximation between the numerical results and the Eurocode curves.\nConsidering different bending moment diagrams for non-uniform bending moments the numerical resistance increases significantly. Therefore, different loading types must be analysed separately. An analytical factor is needed on EC3 design rules for considering these different cases.\nA comparison between the members ultimate loads and the formulae prescribed in EC3 was performed, concluding that the calculation rules are on the safe side and sometimes too conservative. It was possible to observe that the FN Annex is less conservative than the Annex E, having the first a better agreement with the numerical results.\nNew methodologies for the design of cold-formed steel columns, beams and beamcolumns were presented. These proposals were developed to introduce the minimum changes in the existing formulae providing at the same time safety and accuracy when compared to the numerical results.\nFrom the columns analysis, the EN1993-1-2 design rules demonstrated to be in general over conservative. The differences for sigma cross-sections are more evident than for lipped-channel sections. In opposition, the EN1993-1-2 FN Annex design rules are in a better agreement with the numerical results. However, there are many cases that are on the unsafe region. In order to find a balance between the two design rules, New Proposals were developed. The \u201cNew Proposals\u201d present an adaptation of the previous rules in order to maintain the same assumptions/principles and not creating big changes, but covering a greater number of cases in a less conservative way while maintaining safety.\nFrom beams analysis, the EN1993-1-2 design rules are also over conservative for both lipped-channel and sigma sections, as concluded for columns. The EN1993-1-2 FN Annex design rules are closer to the numerical results but for non-uniform bending diagrams the curve is over conservative. Taking advantage of the principles from the \u201cNew Proposals\u201d of columns, the new rules for beams reduce these differences.\nFrom beam-columns analysis, the EN1993-1-2 curves are visibly over conservatives, especially for the cases where the lateral torsion buckling is allowed. The EN1993-1-2 FN Annex design rules present a significant improvement for simple and general cases. However, the shape of the interaction curve looks very inadequate and sometimes not functional, displaying results completely out of the safe domain. Considering the \u201cNew\nProposals\u201d for beams and columns, there is a big change on the proximity of the results to these curves. Nevertheless, performing an arrangement on the coefficients to determining the interaction factor is going to adapt the shape of these curves to the results layout. Even so, there are some over conservative curves for small lengths. Because the sample of numerical results was not large enough as desired, it was preferred to play on the safe side and maintain the adjustments at this level.\nIn general, it is possible to conclude that the current EN1993-1-2 design rules, considering the Annex E, are very conservatives. The FN Annex design rules present in some cases a really good approximation to the numerical results, but a shape not adequate to them, being sometimes over conservatives and other times unsafe, due to the simplicity and simplifications that are allowed for cold-formed steel members.\nThe New Methodologies are in some way easy to apply and they follow the same philosophy of the Eurocode rules. The results are closer to these curves and the respective shape and behaviour follow the same provision of the numerical results.\n7.2\tFuture work\nThe present section describes possible future works on research that demonstrated to be necessary during all these works, on the behaviour of cold-formed profiles on fire conditions.\nExperimental tests should be performed, particularly for beam-columns at elevated temperatures, since no results were found on literature. The numerical simulations performed were developed based on of columns and beams assumptions, but beamcolumns have a particular behaviour that should be experimentally studied. Also, experimental tests to evaluate the behaviour of the residual stresses on different crosssection types should be performed.\nTo validate the New Proposals, more numerical analyses are recommended for different cross-sections types (Z and Q), for more loading types (other bending moment diagrams), considering also the bending action around the weak axis.\nAlso, the distortional buckling as common problem on cold-formed profiles with end and intermediate stiffeners is an important phenomenon to study. The distortional\nbuckling of these profiles under fire should be deeply analysed, which is determinant for a complete understanding of the cold-formed members behaviour.\nCatenary action is also another effect that should be analysed. On fire situation, this phenomenon is very common on beams and to study these advantages for the building safety should be important. Purlins are a typical case of a secondary structural element where it is foreseeable the occurrence of a different phenomenon in fire conditions with the influence of the steel sheeting.\nReferences\nReferences\nAghoury, M.
