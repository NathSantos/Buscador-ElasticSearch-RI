The importance of environmental monitoring is clear from the many oil spills that have occurred over the past three decades. This has encouraged\nboth companies and the public sector involved in the prevention and response to these accidents to develop efficient procedures to minimize the damage caused by\n\naccidents involving oil spill. This study reviews the history of oil spill accidents in Brazil and examines how these events have contributed to the development of\n\ntechnological research through partnerships involving oil companies, government, universities and research institutes, with the emphasis on the Amazon coastal zone.\n\nAs a result, environmental sensitivity indexes (ESIs) for oil spill have been developed specifically for the Amazon coast, where fluvial and marine processes take place\n\nin the estuary of the world\u2019s largest river system. Perspectives on research and emergency response procedures are presented, with the primary objective of conserving\n\nthe social-environmental diversity of the planet\u2019s most important tropical region.\n\nKeywords: environmental sensitivity index, ESI, remote sensing, oil spill, Amazon coastal zone.\n\nRESUMO.

These accidents have encouraged\nthe oil companies and public sector to develop increasingly ef-\nficient procedures, both preventive and emergence response, in\norder to minimize the damage caused by such events.\n\nIn 2000, more than 1300 m3 of fuel oil leaked from the rup-\nture of one of the transfer pipelines at the Duque de Caxias refinery\n(REDUC) into Rio de Janeiro, Guanabara Bay (Bentz &amp; Miranda,\n2001). In July of the same year, a Petrobras pipeline fractured\nat the Presidente Getu?lio Vargas refinery in Parana? state, causing\nthe spill of 3.7 million liters of crude oil into the Barigue river\n(Carvalho, 2003). In 2001, the tanker \u201cMiss Rondo?nia\u201d, loaded\nwith approximately 1900 tons of type A1 oil, sank in the Para? ri-\nver near the Port of Vila do Conde, in the state of Para? (Berredo\net al., 2001).\n\nThese accidents have provoked fundamental changes in the\nsafety and environmental policies of Brazilian petroleum compa-\nnies, in particular Petrobras, as a response to both their social\nresponsibility, and the heavy fines and compensation costs im-\nposed by the courts, in response to these episodes. This shift\nin perspective has resulted in increasing investment in measures\naimed at reducing emissions, residues, and effluents, in addition\nto improvements in the procedures for prevention and control.\nThis has brought the objectives of the petroleum companies in-\ncreasingly in line with the Public anxieties and demands for so-\ncially and environmentally responsible actions. This change in\nattitude was consolidated by the production of maps of environ-\nmental sensitivity to oil spill for a number of different sectors of\nthe Brazilian coast, including that of the Amazon region (Arau?jo et\nal., 2006). A fundamentally important publication was the \u201cBasic\nManual for the Elaboration of Maps of Environmental Sensitivity\nto Oil Spills in the Petrobras System: Coastal and Estuarine Envi-\nronments\u201d (Arau?jo et al., 2002).\n\nIn 2004, a project named PIATAM Mar was established to\nevaluate the \u201cPotential Environmental Impacts of the Transporta-\ntion of Petroleum and its Derivatives in the Amazon Coastal Zone\u201d\n(Sales et al., 2004). The objective of the first phase of this project\n(2004-2005) was the compilation of existing environmental and\nsocial data, covering themes related to geology, oceanography,\nfisheries, biology, tropical diseases, and socio-economic para-\nmeters. The second phase of the project (2006-2008) has concen-\ntrated on the development of a social and environmental diagnosis\nof the areas surrounding ports where oil terminals are located, as\n\nwell as adjacent areas under their indirect influence, represented\nby conservation units (protected areas).\n\nThe production of Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI)\ncharts must take into consideration the juxtaposition of the hy-\ndrological cycles of the rivers of the Amazon basin with the con-\nfiguration of local tides. The combination of these factors results\nin at least 64 different scenarios, which must be considered in\nthe development of the environmental sensitivity maps which will\nprovide support for the development of contingency plans for the\nAmazon coastal zone. The aim of the present paper is to review\nthe level of scientific and technological development that has gone\ninto the production of the ESI charts for the Amazon coastal zone,\nproviding the reader with a historical perspective of the stages\nin the scientific development of this topic, which is so important\nfor the exploration and conservation of the coastal zone.\n\nTHE PAST\n\nIn the mid nineteen-seventies, scientists from the National Oce-\nanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the American\nCoast Guard began to study and classify the sensitivity of coas-\ntal environments to oil spill. This classification was based initi-\nally on the index of vulnerability to oil spills proposed by Gun-\ndlach &amp; Hayes (1978), which was determined by the physical\nand geological characteristics of the coastal pipeline (ARPEL,\n1997). Based on a study of five oil spills, the coastal environ-\nments were classified according to a 10-item scale of sensitivity,\nfrom which a hierarchy of 1 to 10 was defined, referring to increa-\nsing vulnerability according to the type of coastline (Gundlach &amp;\nHayes, 1978).\n\nThis Vulnerability Index became the standard for coastal ma-\nnagement, planning and research into the effects of oil spills on\ndifferent types of coastline. Over time, this index evolved and was\nmodified, leading eventually to the development of the Environ-\nmental Sensitivity Index (ESI).\n\nFrom this moment onwards, ESI charts have been an integral\ncomponent of response and contingency planning for oil spills.\nThe first ESI chart was produced in a matter of days, in 1979, in\nresponse to the advance and impending coastal landing of the oil\nslick resulting from the blowout of the IXTOC 1 well in the Gulf of\nMexico (NOAA, 2002).\n\nIn the nineteen-eighties, ARPEL (Asociacio?n Regional de Em-\npresas de Petro?leo y Gas Natural en Latinoame?rica y el Caribe)\nproduced an innovative ESI atlas for the whole coast of the Uni-\nted States, including Alaska and the Great Lakes, to be used for\nthe planning of contingency measures in response to oil spills\n\nRevista Brasileira de Geof??sica, Vol. 27(Supl. 1), 2009\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2009/12/18 \u2014 16:07 \u2014 page 9 \u2014 #3\n\nPEDRO WALFIR M. SOUZA FILHO et al. 9\n\n(ARPEL, 1997). Prior to 1989, these atlases were, however, a two-\ndimensional representation of a three-dimensional world, with all\nthe information printed in color on paper maps, which had a li-\nmited distribution due to high production costs. Obviously, these\nmaps were not only difficult to produce, but in particular to up-\ndate, especially in comparison with the digital maps available in\nthe present day. Given this, the ESI atlas has been generated\nfrom digital data bases by a Geographic Information System (GIS)\nsince 1989.\n\nIn Brazil, the first ESI chart was produced only in 1993, by\nPetrobras. It covered the company\u2019s exploration and production\nareas in the Campos Basin. In 1996, ARPEL promoted a work-\nshop, during which it recommended the use of a standard sys-\ntem for the production of ESI chart by the different petroleum\ncompanies (Arau?jo et al., 2002). The ESI scale adopted during\nthis workshop was modified from the NOAA proposal, based on\nGundlach &amp; Hayes (1978), to include both biological and social\nparameters, and the adaptation of these parameters to the reality\nof local conditions (Michel et al., 1978).\n\nTHE PRESENT\n\nOn December 12th, 2001, the Brazilian National Environ-\nment Council (CONAMA) published its Resolution number 293,\nwhich defined the minimum parameters for individual emergency\nplans for dealing with oil pollution in ports, dockings or termi-\nnals, pipelines, platforms, and their respective support installati-\nons. This document provides specific instructions for the deve-\nlopment of each plan considering, among others factors, the seri-\nous oil spill that have occurred in the country, and the urgent need\nfor the establishment of guidelines and effective response proce-\ndures for incidents involving oil pollution. Given this, the resolu-\ntion requires that, whenever possible, the analysis of vulnerability\nbe based on the information available in ESI charts, produced ac-\ncording to the relevant technical norms and specifications. The\nlocalization of the vulnerable areas should be indicated clearly\non diagrams and maps, drawn up on an appropriate scale, with\nclear labels.\n\nResolution 293 led to the acceleration of the production of\nESI charts in the country, and an increasing demand for the es-\ntablishment of specific methods for their development. In 2002,\nPetrobras published its \u201cBasic Manual for the Elaboration of Maps\nof Environmental Sensitivity to Oil Spills in the Petrobras Sys-\ntem\u201d (Arau?jo et al., 2002). This publication is a benchmark for\nthe production of ESI charts in Brazil, as well as for the develop-\nment of research into the evaluation of the environmental sensi-\ntivity of the Brazilian coastline, which stretches from the Amazon\n\nzone (?4?N) to the lagoons in the southernmost extreme of the\ncountry (?35?S).\n\nIn 2002, the Northern-Northeastern Cooperative Network\nfor the Environmental Monitoring of Areas under the Influence\nof the Petroleum Industry (Rede 5 \u2013 PETROMAR, FINEP/CNPq/\nPETROBRAS; http://www.geopro.ufrn.br/rede05/), led by the Fe-\nderal University of Rio Grande do Norte, was created through a\nFINEP (Studies and Projects Financier) research initiative. This\ncooperative network is arbitrated by Petrobras, through its Re-\nsearch and Development Center (CENPES), and its Exploration\nand Production Business Units in Rio Grande do Norte and\nCeara? (UN-RNCE), Bahia (UN-BA), and (at the time) Para? (UN-\nPA), in addition to its Northeastern Lubricants and Petroleum\nDerivatives Unit (LUBNOR). PETROMAR created an organizati-\nonal structure for the exchange of information, knowledge and\nexperts, training and scientific specialization, research, and the\ncollection and divulgation of new findings, which allowed its par-\nticipants to identify, evaluate, and eliminate or minimize the ne-\ngative effects of the activities of the petroleum and natural gas\nindustries in the Brazilian North and Northeast. PETRORISCO,\none of the projects of the PETROMAR network, introduced the\napplication of multitemporal ESI maps for areas under meso- and\nmacrotide regime. This resulted in the production of ESI charts,\nwith the collaboration of the PIATAM Mar project, for a number of\nsectors of the northern and northeastern coasts of Brazil.\n\nIn 2002, the Secretariat for Environmental Quality, Coastal\nand Marine Management of the Brazilian Environment Ministry\n(MMA) published its \u201cTechnical Specifications for the Elabora-\ntion of Environmental Sensitivity Charts for Oil Spills\u201d with re-\nference to the coastal and marine zones of the country (MMA,\n2002). This publication was based on the manual of Arau?jo et\nal. (2002) and currently regulates the norms for the production\nand publication of ESI charts in Brazil. In 2004, it was published\nthe ESI Atlas of Ceara? and Potiguar maritime basin (MMA, 2004).\n\nAs of 2006, Petrobras had published 23 ESI charts, cove-\nring 19 coastal and two fluvial terminals, and its marine activi-\nties in Sergipe and Alagoas. This initiative was coordinated by\nCENPES and involved universities, research institutions and en-\nvironmental organizations (Arau?jo et al., 2006). Some 150 re-\nsearchers participated in the project, which covered the whole\nof the Brazilian coastline, from north to south, as well as two\nsectors of the Amazon basin. These publications are based on\nthe NOAA methods, which according to the ARPEL manual, have\nbeen adopted in many different parts of the world. In 2007, MMA\npublished the ESI Atlas of the Santos Maritime Basin (Gherardi\n&amp; Cabral, 2007).\n\nBrazilian Journal of Geophysics, Vol. 27(Supl. 1), 2009\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2009/12/18 \u2014 16:07 \u2014 page 10 \u2014 #4\n\n10 ESI MAPPING OF OIL SPILL IN THE AMAZON COASTAL ZONE\n\nThe PIATAM Mar project\n\nPetrobras has long been working to comprehend the Amazonian\nenvironment as a whole. It has been investing in the develop-\nment of technological tools and processes to support local mo-\nnitoring and environmental management through the projects PI-\nATAM (www.piatam.ufam.edu.br), Cognitus (www.cognitus.org),\nLABCOG (www.lamce.ufrj.br/grva/data/labcogsdk), PIATAM Mar\n(www.piatammar.ufpa.br), and PIATAM Oceano (www.igeo.uff.br/\npiatamoceano). This project focuses on the development of the\ninfrastructure and it is led by the Federal University of Para?\n(UFPA), Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) and CENPES,\nand involves other nine Amazonian institutions. This initiative led\nto the consolidation of a network of researchers who are active in\nthe Amazon coastal zone, developing important scientific studies\nin a number of different fields of expertise.\n\nThe implementation of Phase I of the PIATAM Mar project\nwas characterized by the compilation of the environmental data\nand other information available on the Amazon coastal zone,\nwhich resulted in an integrated overview of current knowledge\nof this region. A total of 3014 references were obtained, all of\nwhich were catalogued in a bibliographic data base, which culmi-\nnated in the publication of the book \u201cBibliography of the Amazon\nCoastal Zone: Brazil\u201d (Souza Filho et al., 2005a). An additional\nresult worth of comment was the development of a computatio-\nnal system for the management of the data base, built using the\nMYSQL language. This system permits a continuous feed of the\nsocial-environmental information in a rapid and secure fashion\n(Souza, 2005). This also allowed the generation of the concep-\ntual bases necessary for the development of a geographic in-\nformation system (SIGmar), which provides a data base for the\nproduction of ESI charts.\n\nThe PIATAM Mar project is based on an innovative scientific\nconcept, in which remote sensing, GIS and cartography combine\nto form a three-way spatial reference (Fig. 1) for the physical (e.g.\nPhysics, Chemistry, Geology), biological (e.g. Botany, Zoology),\nand social (Geography, Sociology and Anthropology) sciences\n(Jensen et al., 1998; Jensen, 2000). These different mapping pro-\ncedures all use techniques or tools that represent practical appli-\ncations of mathematical concepts. Remote sensing permits the\nextraction of information from digital images which contain data\non the radiation reflected, emitted or backscattered by specific tar-\ngets on the Earth\u2019s surface, using specially-developed algorithms\n(Fussel et al., 1986; Dahlberg &amp; Jensen, 1986). This approach\nexists harmoniously alongside other techniques for the collec-\ntion of orbital data, and other mapping science tools, such as GIS\nand cartography. The term GIS refers to computational systems\n\nused for the treatment of geographic data, which integrate alpha-\nnumeric data bases with the spatial representation of real world\nentities. In fact, GIS is a highly-specialized information system,\nwhich combines cartography and the digital processing of images\nfor the spatial analysis of information (Burrough, 1986). As Fisher\n&amp; Lindenberg (1989) have pointed out, these sub-disciplines of\nthe mapping sciences not only provide a baseline for knowledge\nand intellectual activity, but also a spatial orientation tool for the\nanalysis of physical, biological, and social data (Fig. 1).\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Representation of the interaction among the remote sensing, GIS\nand cartographic approaches to mapping, and their relationships with the physi-\ncal, biological and social sciences. M = Mathematics. Modified from Fisher &amp;\nLindenberg (1989) and Jensen (2000).\n\nThe general aim of PIATAM Mar is to generate ESI charts as\nan operational alternative for the monitoring and mapping of the\nAmazon coastal zone. These charts have been developed through\na Geographic Information System, called SIGmar. The results of\nthis initiative will provide guidelines for the use of the InfoPAE\n(Computerized Emergency Action Plan Support) System on the\nAmazon coast. For this, a number of specific aims must be fulfil-\nled, as described below:\n\n1. Develop and implement a geographic information sys-\ntem (SIGmar), linked to a social-environmental data base;\n\n2. Produce ESI charts of the study areas at stra-\ntegic (1:250,000), tactical (1:50,000), and operational\n(1:10,000) scales;\n\n3. Conduct a spatial analysis of the available data and stu-\ndies from the areas of oceanographic geology, chemis-\ntry and physics, social-environmental studies, biology\n(birds and vegetation), archeology, and tropical diseases\n(malaria);\n\n4.

Store the social-environmental data collected during\nthese excursions in the geographical data base of the\nPIATAM Mar project (SIGmar).\n\nThe Amazon coastal zone setting\n\nThe coastal zone of the Brazilian Amazon is located between Tu-\nbara?o Point in the state of Maranha?o (4?S, 43?W) and Cape\nOrange, in Amapa? (5?N, 51?W), encompassing the entire coas-\ntline of the states of Amapa? and Para?, and the western half of\nthat of Maranha?o (Fig. 2). Overall, this zone extends along some\n2250 km, measured on a 1:2,500,000 scale map, not counting\nthe many inlets, islands and small estuaries, which punctuate the\ncoastline (Souza Filho et al., 2005b). This coastal plain, charac-\nterized by flat sandy estuaries and extensive mudflats, is limited\nto the east by the aeolian deposits of the Lenc?o?is Maranhenses\ndune system (Floriani et al., 2004), and extends north and west\nthrough the Guyanas to the Orinoco delta in Venezuela (Gonthier\net al., 2002).\n\nAs part of the Coastal Ecosystem biome (Arruda, 2001), this\nregion is considered to be important for the conservation of the\nBrazilian coastline biodiversity, and is characterized by an acute\nlack of information and by the intensity of anthropogenic pres-\nsures from human occupation (Fundac?a?o BIO-RIO, 2002). In any\ndiscussion of the marine or coastal processes of the Amazon Co-\nastal Zone (ACZ), it is necessary to place its principal hydro-\ngraphic basins into their proper perspective. These include the\nAmazon, the Araguaia-Tocantins, and the smaller coastal rivers,\nwhich together drain an area of approximately 8,127,000 km2,\nand carry sediments, nutrients and all kinds of organic material\n(dissolved, particulate and organisms) into the ACZ. This means\nthat the ACZ is the final destination of millions of tons of sedi-\nments and nutrients each year, carried by millions of cubic meters\nof water draining from an area the size of Australia (Souza Filho et\nal., 2005a).\n\nThe ACZ is located in a meso- to macrotidal area, in which\ntide amplitudes vary from 2 to 8 meters. The region is also cha-\nracterized by the largest continuous tract of mangrove forest found\nanywhere in the world. It is located in a low-lying area, characte-\nrized by a high density of drainage and active processes of ero-\nsion, sedimentation and neotectonics (Souza Filho, 2005). Where\nmacrotides are present, the area of flooded mangrove \u2013 an envi-\nronment extremely sensitive to oil spills \u2013 may extend for up to\n\n30 km inland, and the estuaries themselves as much as 80 km\n(Souza Filho, 2005). All of these characteristics contribute to the\nunique nature of the ACZ, and emphasize the need for adequate\nresearch to guarantee its conservation both in the present and\nfar into the future.\n\nESI charts as oil spill guidelines for the Amazon\ncoastal zone\n\nThe combination of the hydrological cycle of the Amazonian ri-\nvers, with local tide cycles, results in at least 64 distinct environ-\nmental scenarios for the development of the ESI charts necessary\nfor the implementation of effective contingency plans for the coas-\ntal zone. The temporal variation in these tidal and fluvial processes\nis illustrated in Figure 3.\n\nThe estimated long-term average freshwater discharge of the\nAmazon river is of the order of 134,000 m3/s (68% of Brazi-\nlian drainage basin), while that of the Araguaia-Tocantins system\nis 11,000 m3/s. A large part of this discharge \u2013 71,527 m3/s \u2013\noriginates in the countries neighboring Brazil (ANA, 2002). Its\nmean annual discharge of 6.3 trillion m3 represents approxima-\ntely 16% of all the freshwater deposited in the world\u2019s oceans\n(Oltman, 1968). Peak discharge, with a mean of approximately\n220 thousand m3/s (Fig. 3), normally occurs in May, whereas the\nminimum, of around 100 thousand m3/s is usually in November\n(Richey et al., 1986; Nittrouer et al., 1995). Therefore, the ACZ is\nstrongly influenced by Amazon river processes.\n\nThe different tidal scenarios, varying from meso- (amplitude\nof 2\u20134 m) to macrotidal (amplitude > 4 m) are represented by the\n16 combinations described below, and illustrated in Figure 4:\n\n01.

In addition to the flu-\nvial discharge and tides, the local climate is affected primarily by\nthe Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), the position of which\nfluctuates considerably between seasons. In August-September,\nthe ITCZ is typically located at 14?N (Fig. 5), whereas by March-\nApril, it migrates southward to 2?S, defining the dry and wet\nseasons, respectively. Secondarily, other factors control the pre-\ncipitation in the region (REF). Furthermore, El-Nin?o and La-Nin?a\ncycles are responsible, in part, by changes in the precipitation in\nthe Amazon region. Normally, almost 73% of the region\u2019s an-\nnual precipitation falls between January and April, whereas at\nthe peak of the dry season, between September and November,\nrainfall can be almost negligible.\n\nHuman occupation of the Amazon coastal zone\n\nBrazil presents considerable demographic disparities (Fig. 6),\ncharacterized by a major contrast between the Amazon region and\nthe rest of the country. In addition, in both the Amazon and all\nother regions, coastal areas tend to be more densely populated\nthan those further inland (Mello, 2002; Kampel, 2004; Jayme Jr.\n&amp; Crocco, 2005).\n\nEven in coastal regions, however, considerable gaps can be\nobserved. On the Amazon coast, there is a close relationship\nbetween the distribution of the population, and the transport\nnetwork, which is the principal conduit of human colonization in\nthe region (Jayme Jr. &amp; Crocco, 2005).\n\nOverall, population density in Brazil tends to decline from\neast to west. This reflects the general pattern of colonization that\nbegun on the coast, and progressed landward (Melo, 2002). Den-\nsities are very low \u2013 between 0.09 and 15 inhabitants per km2\n\n\u2013 throughout most of the Amazon basin, except for the major\nurban centers (Manaus, Bele?m and Sa?o Lu??s), where it rises to\n11\u201335 inhabitants per km2 (www.ibge.gov.br/censo).\n\nThe Amazon coastal zone is characterized mainly by muni-\ncipalities with relatively small populations, most of which are\nbetween 10 and 25 thousand inhabitants (Fig. 7). In the coas-\ntal region of the state of Amapa?, most municipalities have even\nsmaller populations, of less than 10 thousand inhabitants. Only\nBele?m and Sa?o Lu??s, capitals of the states of Para? and Maranha?o,\nrespectively, have populations of over one million inhabitants.\n\nOperational risks of oil spills\n\nThe increasing operational safety applied to the exploration, pro-\nduction, and transportation of petroleum and its products by the\npetroleum companies over the past few years has led to a consi-\nderable reduction in the risk of accidents. Despite this, however,\nsome disasters have still occurred, and the damage sustained per-\nsists as a serious threat to coastal areas.\n\nIt has been estimated that at least 4.5 million tons of oil is spil-\nled each year worldwide. The principal causes are tanker cleaning\noperations and accidents occurring during the transportation of\nfuel (ESA, 1998). The Amazon estuary is obviously at considera-\nble risk from the latter phenomenon.\n\nThe ports of the coastal states of the Amazon involved in the\ntransportation and storage of petroleum and its derivatives repre-\nsent the areas with the highest risk of such incidents, as the most\nlikely locations of oil spills. These locations include the ports of\nSantana, in Amapa?, and Itaqui, in Maranha?o, as well as the Outeiro\nand Miramar terminals and the Vila do Conde port, all located in\nthe state of Para? (Fig. 8). The protected areas adjacent to these\nports (Fig. 2) are considered to be under their indirect influence.\nIn the PIATAM Mar project, these conservation units are treated\nas control areas, given both their well-preserved conditions and\ntheir proximity to transportation routes (Fig. 9). These areas are\nthe Lago Piratuba Biological Reserve in Amapa?, the Soure Marine\nSustainable Exploitation Reserve in Para?, and the Ilha dos Caran-\nguejos Environmental Protection Area, in Maranha?o (Fig. 2).\n\nBrazilian Journal of Geophysics, Vol. 27(Supl. 1), 2009\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2009/12/18 \u2014 16:07 \u2014 page 14 \u2014 #8\n\n14 ESI MAPPING OF OIL SPILL IN THE AMAZON COASTAL ZONE\n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Environmental scenarios for the development of oil spill contingency plans for the Amazon coastal zone (Almeida, 2008).\n\nFigure 5 \u2013 GOES satellite image showing the position of the ITCZ over South America on (A) March 3rd , 2004, and (B) August 25th, 2004.

In these areas, the ade-\nquate application of contingency measures results in a reduction\n\nin contamination, thereby mitigating impacts on the environment.\nIn this scenario, ESI charts are essential for the most efficient\napplication of the available response resources, making the clean-\nup operation more effective.\n\nBrazilian Journal of Geophysics, Vol. 27(Supl. 1), 2009\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2009/12/18 \u2014 16:07 \u2014 page 16 \u2014 #10\n\n16 ESI MAPPING OF OIL SPILL IN THE AMAZON COASTAL ZONE\n\nFigure 8 \u2013 Port areas surveyed during the PIATAM Mar project: (A) Port of Santana; (B) Outeiro Terminal; (C) Miramar Terminal; (D) Port of Vila do Conde; and\n(E) Port of Itaqui. For geographic location, see Figure 2. Based on Ikonos images acquired in 2007.\n\nIn the PIATAM Mar project, the ESI charts are produced\naccording to NOAA (2002) procedures, with adaptations appro-\npriate to the specific conditions of the Amazon coastal zone. The\nremote sensing products used in the creation of these documents\nare as follows:\n\n\u2022 ESI charts in strategic scale (1:250,000) of the whole\nAmazon coastal zone based on the processing of RADAR-\nSAT-1 Wide 1 images and mosaics of JERS-1 SAR and\nSRTM images, with spatial resolution of 30 m, 90 m, and\n90 m, respectively;\n\n\u2022 ESI charts in tactical scale (1:50,000) of the protected\n\nareas based on the processing of RADARSAT-1 Wide 1,\nLandsat TM and ETM+, and CBERS-2 images, with spatial\nresolution of 30 m, 30 m, 15 m, and 20 m, respectively;\n\n\u2022 ESI charts in tactical scale (1:10,000) of the port areas\nbased on the processing of Ikonos images, with a spatial\nresolution of 1 m.\n\nESI charts will be produced in the SIGmar geographic infor-\nmation system (Costa et al., 2005) and will be used in associa-\ntion with a social-environmental data base (Souza, 2005; Costa et\nal., 2005; Castro et al., 2006). This system was modeled in three\nmodules, as follows:\n\nRevista Brasileira de Geof??sica, Vol. 27(Supl. 1), 2009\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2009/12/18 \u2014 16:07 \u2014 page 17 \u2014 #11\n\nPEDRO WALFIR M.

A variety of thematic\nmaps will be generated in ArcGIS 9.0 software to attend\nto the requirements of the system. These maps provide a\nmore reliable assessment of risks and potential damage,\non which the more efficient coordination of oil spill pre-\nvention operations can be based;\n\n\u2022 Report Module: three classes of report are generated.\nClass A reports are very detailed, and are designed to pro-\nvide the authorities responsible for clean-up operations\nwith the information they need; the briefer class B reports\nare destined for the Media. By contrast, class C reports are\nprovided to local organizations that may be affected by the\noil spill.\n\nESI for the Amazon coastal zone\n\nThe ESI scale classifies coastal environments according to their\nrelative sensitivity to oil spills, taking into consideration natu-\nral, physical and biological processes. This scale was developed\non the basis of prior experience with actual oil spills, as well as\nfieldwork in each type of environment. The classification is thus\nbased on a comprehensive understanding of the environment,\nincluding the relationships between physical processes and the\nsubstrate, which produce specific types of environment, and per-\nmit the prediction of the ways in which the spilt oil may behave\nand move (MMA, 2002).\n\nIn addition, the unique complexities of the Amazon basin,\nin terms of both the dynamics of environmental (sedimentary,\ngeomorphological, oceanographic and biological) processes, and\nthe importance and fragility of this rich ecosystem, demand the\ndevelopment of a specific approach, which takes the intricacy of\nlocal variations in account. From this perspective, Souza Filho et\nal. (2004) proposed an ESI classification for the Amazon coastal\nzone (Tab. 1) based on a modification of the proposals of NOAA\n(2002) and Arau?jo et al. (2002). Subsequently, Gonc?alves (2005),\nGonc?alves et al. (2006), Teixeira (2006), Boulhosa (2006), Al-\nmeida (2008), Boulhosa &amp; Souza Filho (2009) and Teixeira &amp;\nSouza Filho (2009), followed this adaptation in order to map a\n\nBrazilian Journal of Geophysics, Vol. 27(Supl. 1), 2009\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2009/12/18 \u2014 16:07 \u2014 page 18 \u2014 #12\n\n18 ESI MAPPING OF OIL SPILL IN THE AMAZON COASTAL ZONE\n\nnumber of different sectors of the zone, and attribute indexes of\nenvironmental sensitivity to oil spill to each one.\n\nTable 1 \u2013 ESI shoreline classification for the Amazon Coast (modified from\nSouza Filho et al., 2004).\n\nESI Ranking Amazon Coastal Environments\n\n1A Exposed rocky shores.\n\n1B Exposed, solid man-made structures.\n\n1C Exposed rocky cliffs with boulder talus base.\n\n2 Exposed scarps and steep slopes in clay.\n\n3A Fine to medium grained sand beaches.\n\n3B Scarps and steep slopes in sand.\n\n4 Coarse- grained sand beaches.\n\n5 Mixed sand and gravel banks and beaches.\n\n6 Riprap.\n\n7 Exposed tidal flats.\n\n8A Sheltered scarps in bedrock, mud, or clay.\n\nSheltered rocky shores (impermeable), Paleo-cliff.\n\n8B Sheltered, solid man-made structures.\n\n8C Sheltered riprap.\n\n8D Peat shorelines.\n\n9A Sheltered tidal flats mangrove scarp.\n\n9B Vegetated low banks and tidal flats.\n\n9C Hypersaline tidal flats or supratidal sandflats.\n\n10A Salt, and brackish- water marshes.\n\n10B Freshwater marshes with aquatic vegetation,\nflooded forest (\u201cvarzea\u201d) and intermitent lakes.\n\n10C Intertidal mangrove.\n\n10D Supratidal mangrove.\n\nTHE FUTURE\n\nThe principal objective of the PIATAM Mar project is the forma-\ntion of a data base which organizes systematically all the social\nand environmental information available for the Amazon coastal\nzone. It is expected that these data can be mapped and cross-\nreferenced in such a way as to generate new types of information\nfor the production of ESI charts.\n\nSocial-environmental data will be collected during joint sci-\nentific expeditions, in which they will be integrated with the col-\nlection of abiotic (geology, chemistry, geomorphology and ocea-\nnography, physics), biological (birds, fish, benthic fauna, plank-\nton), and tropical disease (malaria) data in order to achieve the\nbest possible understanding of the environment as a whole. The\nmapping of these data will be essential, and to this end, the long-\nterm availability and acquisition of remote sensing imagery will\nbe fundamentally important.\n\nPerspectives of the new remote sensor data\n\nUp to 1991, the available orbital remote sensing data with glo-\nbal coverage were of the multi-spectral electro-optical type (which\noperates in the visible electromagnetic and the infrared spectra)\nsuch as, for example, the NOAA (AVHRR) low spatial resolution\n(1.1 km) sensors, and the moderate spatial resolution (10\u201330 km)\nLandsat series (MSS, TM and ETM+), SPOT (HRV and HRVIR) and\nCBERS (CCD) sensors, which provide images that are extremely\naffected by the presence of cloud cover, which is almost always\npresent in the equatorial region. During the nineteen-nineties,\nnew microwave sensors (Synthetic Aperture Radar \u2013 SAR), e.g.\nERS 1 and 2, JERS-1, and RADARSAT-1, were launched. Given\ntheir long wavelengths (5.6, 23, and 5.6 cm, respectively), these\nsystems allow images to be acquired under unfavorable climatic\nconditions. It is important to remember here that all these types of\nsensor provide low to moderate spatial resolution. Electro-optical\nimages from high spatial resolution (4 m or less) sensors such as\nIkonos, Quickbird, and SPOT 5 (HRG), were only available com-\nmercially from 1999 onwards. Multi-spectral sensors of low to\nmedium spatial resolution, such as the MODIS sensors on the\nTERRA and AQUA satellites, nevertheless provide imaging on an\nalmost daily basis, which is extremely useful for the monitoring\nof the dynamics of the Amazon coastline.\n\nLow to medium spatial resolution sensors have been used\nfor the production of strategic scale (1:250,000) ESI charts, while\nthose at a tactical scale (1:50,000) have been derived from ima-\ngery of moderate resolution. High resolution images are only ne-\ncessary for the production of ESI charts at the operational level\n(scale of 1:10,000).\n\nGiven the electro-optical characteristics of the high reso-\nlution sensors, operational ESI charts can only be produced\nduring the driest part of the year, which is June to Novem-\nber in the Amazon coastal zone. During the rest of the year,\ncloud cover is extensive, due to the positioning of the inter-\ntropical convergence zone (ITCZ). This limitation can neverthe-\nless be overcome by the use of airborne sensors, such as\nCENSIPAM\u2019s SAR-R99B, although, like all airborne equipment,\nthe operational logistics of this system is complex, and it is\nnot always possible to acquire data during the required period.\nThe use of SAR technology in the reconnaissance and map-\nping of coastal environments expanded considerably following\nthe launches of the ALOS satellite (www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/)\nin 2006, and RADARSAT-2 (www.radarsat2.info/) and Terra-\nSAR (www.lsespace.com/missions/terrasar.php) in 2007.

Given this diversity, a single map of the\nvulnerability of local coastal environments to oil spill incidents\nwould be inadequate. Clearly, it is necessary to update such maps\non a regular \u2013 seasonal and yearly \u2013 basis, in accordance with the\nspatial dynamic of the region. The production of ESI charts for the\nAmazon coastal zone is thus a considerable challenge, which re-\nquires the systematic use of orbital remote sensing data, GIS data\nanalysis, and field investigation of remote areas.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nOur special thanks to Dr. Cleverson Guizan Silva, editor-in-chief\nof the Brazilian Journal of Geophysics (RBGf), and all the col-\nlaborators and reviewers who contributed to this paper through\ntheir criticisms and suggestions.
