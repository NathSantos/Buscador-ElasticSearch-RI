First of all my deepest gratitude goes to my supervisor Professor Maria Luisa de Carvalho \n\n(Centro de F\u00edsica At\u00f3mica, Departamento de F\u00edsica da Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias da Universidade de \n\nLisboa). You made it possible for me to start a scientific career providing all kinds of resources \n\nand support. I recognize and deeply appreciate the effort you always put in finding means of \n\nsupporting me financially, given the present difficult times. By granting me the possibility to \n\nparticipate in (national and international) projects related to X-ray Spectrometry applied to the \n\nCultural Heritage, I have acquired experience and confidence to come forward. An important \n\nstage of my life was moving to Berlin and even though I never felt neglected. Thank you for \n\nyour scientific guidance, advisory, comprehension, trust and above all friendship. \n\n? My gratitude is also extended to my other supervisor Professor Jo\u00e3o Coroado \n\n(Departamento de Arte e Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e Restauro do Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico de Tomar), who I had \n\nthe pleasure to meet during my masters studies. Your knowledge in glazed ceramics is \n\noutstanding and this was essential for me to get into this new field of investigation. Thanks for \n\nthe long talks via Skype? and for clarifying all my doubts. In your own words: \u201cTalking about \n\nthese subjects is like eating sweets.\u201d In fact, your enthusiasm on this field kept me motivated to \n\ncarry on and wanting to know more about it. Thank you for your suggestions, advises and \n\nknowledge transfer. \n\n?

caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o de cer\u00e2micas vidradas \n\n(antigas) produzidas entre os s\u00e9culos XVI e XVIII em Coimbra e Lisboa. Para tal recorreu-se a \n\numa metodologia multianal\u00edtica de modo a fornecer informa\u00e7\u00e3o cient\u00edfica a v\u00e1rios n\u00edveis para \n\nse obter par\u00e2metros identificadores destas produ\u00e7\u00f5es. Paralelamente, este estudo surge como \n\numa oportunidade para o apuramento do conhecimento e da reconstitui\u00e7\u00e3o da tecnologia e do \n\nsistema de produ\u00e7\u00e3o usado em Coimbra, particluarmente faian\u00e7as. \n\nDe um modo geral, cer\u00e2micas vidradas policromas s\u00e3o caracterizadas por tr\u00eas zonas: corpo \n\ncer\u00e2mico, vidrado e superf\u00edcie decorativa. A escolha das mat\u00e9rias-primas bem como o processo \n\nde manufactura (aplica\u00e7\u00e3o do vidrado, temperatura de cozedura, entre outros) s\u00e3o factores \n\nque influenciam a pe\u00e7a final. O corpo cer\u00e2mico \u00e9 composto maioritariamente por minerais \n\nargilosos, oxidos de sil\u00edcio (Si) a Alum\u00ednio (Al) e inclus\u00f5es n\u00e3o pl\u00e1sticas (t\u00eampera). Os minerais \n\nargilosos comferem plasticidade \u00e0 pasta; silica (SiO2) tem um papel estrutural e \u00e9 refract\u00e1rio \u2013 \n\nponto de fus\u00e3o alto (1600 \u2013 1725 \u00b0C); t\u00eamperas podem ser impurezas intr\u00edsecas aos minerais \n\nargilosos ou adicionadas pelo oleiro para conferir as propriedades desejadas.  \n\nO vidrado \u00e9 constitu\u00eddo por tr\u00eas (ou quatro) grupos de compostos: i) formadores de rede \u2013 \n\nmaioritariamente silica (SiO2); ii) modificadores de rede (ou fluxos) \u2013 maioritariamento oxidos \n\nde chumbo (ex. PbO) e minerais argilosos (para baixar o ponto de fus\u00e3o da estrutura silicatada); \n\niii) intermedi\u00e1rios  - para rep\u00f4r as propriedades perdidas pela introdu\u00e7\u00e3o de fluxos; iv) agentes \n\nopacos \u2013 normalmente Cassiterite (SnO2).  \n\nOs escassos estudos cer\u00e2micos j\u00e1 desenvolvidos privilegiam as manufacturas de Lisboa em \n\ndetrimento das de Coimbra, encaradas como mais perif\u00e9ricas e de menor qualidade. No \n\nentanto, este preconceito exige uma reflex\u00e3o mais profunda, pois aspectos considerados pouco \n\ncuidados (tipo de vidrados, tonalidades mais densas dos \u00f3xidos, maior porosidade das pastas) \n\npoder\u00e3o dever-se a constrangimentos na aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de mat\u00e9rias-primas e consequente \n\nimprovisa\u00e7\u00e3o do que havia dispon\u00edvel. O facto \u00e9 que qualquer pe\u00e7a da produ\u00e7\u00e3o de Coimbra \u00e9 \n\navidamente coleccionada, mesmo fora das fronteiras nacionais. Atrav\u00e9s de uma caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nvisual, t\u00eam vindo a ser intu\u00eddos pelos ceram\u00f3logos alguns aspectos potencialmente marcadores \n\n\n\n2 \n \n\ndas cer\u00e2micas de Coimbra, mas faltam crit\u00e9rios cient\u00edficos que permitam confirmar estas \n\nhip\u00f3teses. \n\nOs objectos de estudo pertecem a dois grupos de cer\u00e2mica vidrada: faian\u00e7as utilit\u00e1rias \n\n(originais de Coimbra) e azulejos (originais de Coimbra e Lisboa). Os fragmentos de faian\u00e7as \n\nforam recolhidos do esp\u00f3lio existente no Mosteiro de Santa Clara-a-Velha (Coimbra) atrav\u00e9s do \n\nMuseu Machado de Castro (MMC) em Coimbra e os fragmentos de azulejos \u2013 quer de Coimbra \n\ne de Lisboa \u2013 foram obtidos atrav\u00e9s do Museu Nacional do Azulejos (MNAz) em Lisboa. Tendo \n\nem conta o objectivo principal proposto, este estudo assenta em duas grandes vias de \n\ninvestiga\u00e7\u00e3o: caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o composicional de pe\u00e7as com origem conhecida (Coimbra e Lisboa) \n\ne prepara\u00e7\u00e3o e caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o de modelos laboratoriais. Os modelos criados em laborat\u00f3rio \n\nservir\u00e3o para obter informa\u00e7\u00e3o sobre a origem da mat\u00e9ria-prima utilizada, dos processos de \n\nfabrico, nomeadamente da temperatura de cozedura, processo de aplica\u00e7\u00e3o do vidrado e \n\naplica\u00e7\u00e3o dos pigmentos. Pretende-se assim com este trabalho o desenvolvimento de um \n\nextenso programa anal\u00edtico,  que permitir\u00e1 a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o elementar, composicional, \n\nmineral\u00f3gica e morfol\u00f3gica ao n\u00edvel do corpo cer\u00e2mico, vidrado e pigmentos. Al\u00e9m disto, as \n\nzona de interface (pigmento/vidrado e vidrado/corpo cer\u00e2mico) ser\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m analisadas, pois \n\na interac\u00e7\u00e3o pigmento/vidrado e vidrado/corpo cer\u00e2mico depende das mat\u00e9rias primas \n\nutilizadas bem como da temperatura de cozedura. \n\nTendo em conta os objectivos propostos \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio escolher t\u00e9cnicas espectrosc\u00f3picas \n\nn\u00e3o destrutivas, isto \u00e9, que preservem a integridade f\u00edsica e qu\u00edmica do objecto a analisar. As \n\nt\u00e9cnicas usadas neste trabalho s\u00e3o: espectroscopia por Fluoresc\u00eancia de Raios X (do ingl\u00eas, \n\nXRF), Difrac\u00e7\u00e3o de Raios X (do ingl\u00eas, XRD), Microscopia por Varrimento Electr\u00f3nico com \n\nsistema de espectroscopia por Fluoresc\u00eancia de Raios X acoplado (do ingl\u00eas, SEM/EDX) e \n\nespectroscopia por Absorp\u00e7\u00e3o de Raios X (do ingl\u00eas, XAFS).  \n\nXRF permite a identifica\u00e7\u00e3o simult\u00e2nea bem como quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos elementos presentes \n\nnuma amostra, com n\u00famero at\u00f3mico superior a 9. O facto de esta t\u00e9cnica ser n\u00e3o destrutiva, \n\nfaz dela um m\u00e9todo de elei\u00e7\u00e3o para a an\u00e1lise de objects com valor hist\u00f3rico, art\u00edstico e \n\narqueol\u00f3gico. Al\u00e9m do m\u00e9todo convencional de XRF, foi tamb\u00e9m usada a vertente confocal (ou \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\n3D) de XRF. Com esta vertente, consegue-se seleccionar volumes de amostra e efectuar \n\nvarrimentos em profundidade, obtendo uma informa\u00e7\u00e3o tri-dimensional elementar da amostra. \n\nXRD fornece informa\u00e7\u00e3o ao n\u00edvel mineral\u00f3gico que constitui as amostras. Acedendo a esta \n\ninforma\u00e7\u00e3o consegue-se assim aceder directamente \u00e0s mat\u00e9trias-primas utilizada bem como a \n\nminerais que surgem como conseque\u00eancia das transforma\u00e7\u00f5es t\u00e9rmicas que ocorrem durante o \n\nprocesso de cozedura. \n\nSEM/EDX fornece informa\u00e7\u00e3o ao n\u00edvel morfol\u00f3gico, em que imagens dos cristais que \n\npertencem \u00e0 estrutura das mat\u00e9rias-primas s\u00e3o visualizados. Tendo esta informa\u00e7\u00e3o dispon\u00edvel, \n\nconseguem-se estimar processos de cozedura utilizados, mais precisamente temperaturas \n\nutilizadas. O tamanho e a forma dos cristais \u00e9 ind\u00edcio desta ultima propriedade.  \n\nPor fim, XAFS, vem complementar a informa\u00e7\u00e3o que \u00e9 \u201cperdida\u201d com XRD. A alta \n\nsensibilidade qu\u00edmica para especia\u00e7\u00e3o de um \u00fanico \u00e1tomo, vem colmatar as dificuldades \n\nimpostas pelos artefactos experimentais em XRD. Com XAFS, consegue-se averiguar o estado e \n\noxida\u00e7\u00e3o de um dado \u00e1tomo bem como a dist\u00e2ncia a que se encontram os \u00e1tomos vizinhos \n\nmais pr\u00f3ximos desse \u00e1tomo. Assim sendo, informa\u00e7\u00e3o acerca da geometria da mol\u00e9cula em que \n\no que \u00e1tomo se encontra bem como tipos de liga\u00e7\u00e3o entre este e os seus vizinhos, consegue ser \n\nobtida. Estas propriedades tornam a t\u00e9cnica de XAFS bastante apelativa para estudos em \n\nobjects ligados ao patrim\u00f3nio cultural. A \u00fanica dificuldade \u00e9 ter que recorrer a um sincrotr\u00e3o \n\npara poder efectuar tais medi\u00e7\u00f5es. O facto de ser uma t\u00e9cnica altamente sens\u00edvel a n\u00edvel \n\nat\u00f3mico requer o uso de fontes de radia\u00e7\u00e3o X com determinadas propriedades que n\u00e3o se \n\nencontram em laborat\u00f3rio, tais como, coer\u00eancia, alto brilho e muito baixa diverg\u00eancia.  \n\nAplicando esta aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o multianal\u00edtica aos objectos em estudo \u2013 e tendo em conta o \n\nobjectivos propostos \u2013 foram obtidas diferen\u00e7as entre as produ\u00e7\u00f5es de Coimbra e Lisboa, \n\ndestacando as faian\u00e7as das demais. Resultados obtidos por XRF e XRD demosntram que o corpo \n\ncer\u00e2mico dos Azulejos \u00e9 mais heretog\u00e9neo e mais poroso do que o das faian\u00e7as. Mais ainda, foi \n\nobtido que os corpos cer\u00e2micos de Azulejos ter\u00e3o sido submetidos a temperaturas de cozedura \n\nmais elevadas do que os de Faian\u00e7as. Isto confirma-se pela presen\u00e7a de minerais metaest\u00e1veis \n\nque se formam a mais altas temperaturas, tais como a Cristobalite (um polimorfo da silica que \n\nse forma a alta temperatura). Foi tamb\u00e9m detectada a presen\u00e7a de chumbo (Pb) \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\n(principalmente em Azulejos) na parte de tr\u00e1s do corpo cer\u00e2mico. Isto deve-se \u00e0 elevada \n\nporosidade no corpo cer\u00e2mico de Azulejos que favorece a penetra\u00e7\u00e3o de Pb pelos poros at\u00e9 ao \n\nfundo do corpo cer\u00e2mico. Este fen\u00f3meno est\u00e1 de acordo com o processo de manufactura das \n\npe\u00e7as. Faian\u00e7as s\u00e3o produzidas ao torno oleiro enquanto que os Azulejos s\u00e3o produzidos em \n\nplacas, conferindo assim maior heterogeneidade. \n\nFaian\u00e7as t\u00eam um vidrado mais fino (espessura m\u00e1x. 180 \u00b5m) do que os azulejos (espessura \n\nm\u00e1x. 400 \u00b5m). Atrav\u00e9s de XRF foi poss\u00edvel identifcar elementos-chave para vidrado e cores \n\nusadas para a camada decorativa: Cobalto (Co) para o azul, Antim\u00f3nio (Sb) para o amarelo, \n\nMangan\u00eas (Mn) para o p\u00farpura, Cobre (Cu) para o verde e Chumbo (Pb) para o vidrado.  \n\nAtrav\u00e9s de SEM/EDX foi poss\u00edvel obervar que Estanho (Sn) doi adicionado intencionalmente \n\npelo oleiro \u00e0 mistura do pigmento azul. Isto deve-se ao facto de o azul de Co ser muito escuro \n\n(quase preto) e n\u00e3o \u00e9 esse o tom de c\u00f4r que se observa a olho n\u00fa. Sendo SnO2 um composto \n\nque confere uma c\u00f4r esbranqui\u00e7ada, confere-se a adi\u00e7\u00e3o de este ao pigmento azul. Uma das \n\ngrandes contribui\u00e7\u00f5es deste estudo foi verificar Co est\u00e1 associado a uma corrente de 5 \n\nelementos: Fe-Co-Ni-As-Bi. Apesar de Bi ter sido detectado por XRF, este n\u00e3o foi detectado com \n\nestando associado \u00e0 fonte de Co. Mais ainda, em faian\u00e7as de Coimbra, as estruturas de Co s\u00e3o \n\nricas em Ferro (Fe) enquanto que em Azulejos estas s\u00e3o ricas em N\u00edquel (Ni).  \n\nOutro resultado importante foi verificar diferen\u00e7as na morfologia dos cristais que comp\u00f5em \n\no pigmento amarelo. Segundo fontes documentais, o pigmento amarelo mais usado e mais \n\nprov\u00e1vel ter\u00e1 sido o Amarelo de N\u00e1poles (Pb2Sb2O7). Atrav\u00e9s de SEM/EDX foi verificado que os \n\ncristais de amarelo de N\u00e1poles em azulejos de Lisboa s\u00e3o hexagonos bem definidos \u2013 t\u00edpico do \n\npigmento em si e indicativo de uma temperatura de cozedura acima dos 1100 ?C. Nas faian\u00e7as \n\nde Coimbra estes cristais t\u00eam formas mais irregulares (tri\u00e2ngulares) em vez de hexagonais. De \n\nacordo com a literatura esta forma de cristais indica temperaturas de cozedura inferiores a \n\n1000 ?C. Al\u00e9m do mais, atrav\u00e9s de XAFS obtiveram-se diferen\u00e7as na pr\u00f3pria estrutura cristalina \n\ndo pigmento amarelo. Amostras de Coimbra (faian\u00e7as e Azulejos) o composto na forma de \n\nPb2Sb2O7 ter\u00e1 sido usado enquanto que nas amostras de Lisboa, uma mistura de compostos de \n\nPb e Sb foi identificada. \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nEste trabalho \u00e9 pioneiro no estudo cient\u00edfico de t\u00e3o valioso esp\u00f3lio e com a informa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nobtida surgiram 4 publica\u00e7\u00f5es em revistas internacionais cient\u00edficas com um factor de impacto \n\nsiginificativo na \u00e1rea de espectrosocpia. Foram fornececidas respostas acerca das mat\u00e9rias-\n\nprimas e propriedades composicionais \u2013 ao n\u00edvel mineral\u00f3gico e morfol\u00f3gico. Assim sendo, o \n\ncampo das artes em Portugal pode ser usado como base para desenvolver metodologias de \n\nconserva\u00e7\u00e3o e restauro. Este trabalho proporcionou n\u00e3o s\u00f3 nova informa\u00e7\u00e3o acerca das \n\nprodu\u00e7\u00f5es de Coimbra e Lisboa mas tamb\u00e9m a abertura de horizontes para dar continuidade a \n\nesta investiga\u00e7\u00e3o. O universo de amostra aqui analisado seviu para extrair diferen\u00e7as entre os \n\ncentros de manufactura cer\u00e2mica mas h\u00e1 fica implicita a necessidade de analisar cer\u00e2micas de \n\noutros centros, como por exemplo Porto ou Alcoba\u00e7a. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Faian\u00e7as de Coimbra; Azulejos; Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o multianal\u00edtica; Caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ncomposicional; Diferen\u00e7as entre t\u00e9cnicas de manufactura;   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nABSTRACT \n\nPolychrome glazed ceramics (faiences and wall-tiles) originally produced in the two main \n\nmanufacturing centers between the XVI and XVIII centuries, Coimbra and Lisbon (Portugal), \n\nwere object of study.  In order to overcome mislabeling of objects which are not properly \n\nidentified \u2013 e.g. by potters marks \u2013 this investigation addresses to gain knowledge concerning \n\nmanufacturing technological aspects by a multianalytical (non-destructive) approach. Since no \n\nscientific data was found regarding faiences produced in Coimbra, this serves as a contribution \n\nfor the classification of \u201cFaience from Coimbra\u201d.  \n\nThe samples are characterized by ceramic support, a glaze and surface decoration. \n\nDepending on the raw materials as well as the manufacturing process involved \u2013 e.g. firing \n\ntemperature \u2013 these three main regions will interact with each other differently. Therefore, \n\ninformation obtained at the interface-areas is important. \n\nConsidering the objectives of this work, the chosen analytical methods were: X-ray \n\nFluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy / Energy Dispersive X-\n\nray System (SEM/EDX) and X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS). It was shown that faiences \n\nare a unique kind of glazed ceramics and differences between the productions from Coimbra \n\nand Lisbon arose. Faiences have thinner glazes (max. 180 \u00b5m) than wall-tiles (max. 400 \u00b5m). \n\nKey elements are: Co for blue, Mn for purple, Cu for green, Sb for yellow, Pb for glaze. \n\nElemental and morphological features have shown that Sn is mixed in the blue to lighten the \n\nfinal hue and Co-structures are in a Fe-rich environment in faiences and in a Ni-rich \n\nenvironment in wall-tiles.  \n\nRegarding the yellows, the hexagonal shape found for wall-tiles from Lisbon indicates that a \n\nhigher temperature was used (? 1100 ?C), in comparison to the samples from Coimbra (faiences \n\nand wall-tiles), which shape is irregular and triangular-like (from 950 ?C). Furthermore, the \n\ncompound used for yellow pigments is different between Coimbra and Lisbon. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Coimbra faiences; Wall-tiles; Multianalytical investigation; Compositional \n\ncharacterization; Differences in manufacturing techniques. \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nCHAPTER 1 \u2013 INTRODUCTION TO GLAZED CERAMICS \n\nPottery-wares are magnificent and complex objects carrying intrinsic historical, cultural and \n\ntraditional values. Their high resistance to weathering mechanisms allows us to infer about past \n\ntraditions through direct and indirect evidences on manufacturing techniques, raw materials \n\nand decoration employed, characteristic of a culture, region or country. \n\nFeatures like the chemical composition (dependent on the raw materials and recipes used) \n\nand the firing stages applied, will dictate the type, or class of object. Nowadays there is huge \n\nvariety of ceramics, including the traditional pottery for domestic use and decorative ware, \n\nporcelains, sanitary, bricks and tiles. Moreover, modern ceramic materials are used for example \n\nas thermal insulators, with high thermal and mechanical resistance, for medical proteases and \n\neven for computer memory devices.  \n\nBased on the properties of the processed products, traditional ceramics can be divided into \n\ntwo groups: porous (or permeable) and non-porous (or impermeable). The former are \n\ncharacterized by their ability of absorbing water and the latter by having practically no porosity, \n\nresulting in new crystalline phases during the firing process, at high temperature. Examples of \n\nporous bodies are faiences and refractory clays (with a melting point of > 1600 ?C) while non-\n\nporous bodies are typical in porcelain [1]. \n\nCeramic objects can be classified according to body\u2019s porosity and firing range as resumed in \n\nTable 1.1 [2]. Based on this taxonomy all objects under consideration in this work are \n\nearthenware.  \n\n \n\nTable 1.1 \u2013 General taxonomy of the ceramic bodies [2]. \n\nBody Porosity Firing Range \n\nTerracotta High: ? 10% &lt;1000 ?C \n\nEarthenware 3% - 10% 900 \u2013 1200 ?C \n\nStoneware 0.5% - 3% 1200 \u2013 1350 ?C \n\nPorcelain 0% - 1% 1300 \u2013 1450 ?C \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nAnother feature that has been used to define the type of ceramic objects is surface \n\ntreatment. Depending on it other object designations became known and accepted as \n\ndefinition for the pieces. Surface treatments have appeared to embellish the ceramic body and \n\nto reduce the permeability to fluids. They can cover the ceramic body partially or entirely, \n\napplied before or after firing [2]. The most common surface treatments are slips and glazes. \n\nGlazes are vitreous substances, having in its constitution a mixture of materials, which then are \n\napplied onto fired ceramic bodies (bisque) and submitted to a firing procedure, at high \n\ntemperature. This was a great breakthrough in the history of ceramics manufacture, as it forms \n\nan impermeable, shiny, smooth layer, which is ideal for surface decoration application. \n\nThe origin of glazes production dates back to around 2000 B.C. in Mesopotamia. The \n\ndevelopment of glazes are interesting to observe and well documented by Gustav Weiss [3]. \n\nThe glaze technology has evolved and improved. Until 550 A.D. glazes were of the alkali-lime-\n\nsilica type, with similar composition to the contemporary glass, as the study on several glazed \n\npottery from this period shows, reported by M. S. Tite [4]. Such studies have proven that there \n\nwere no changes in the chemical composition of the glazes for a 2000-year period, and the glass \n\nand glaze content at this time was very similar, suggesting that glass ground to a powder (frit) \n\nand applied onto the bisque was used as glaze. The next important step on this path was the \n\nintroduction of lead (Pb) into glazes\u2019 composition, with values between 45-60% (high-lead \n\nglazes), in the oxide form, during the I century B.C in Anatolia. \n\nThe introduction of Pb as one of the major components in the glaze has brought advantages \n\nlike easier application due to its inherent insolubility, reduced possibility of cracking due to its \n\nlow thermal expansion (0.106 x 10\n-6\n\n/?C) and it offers a higher optical brilliance. \n\nA milestone in glaze\u2019s history was the introduction of tin (Sn) to their composition, around \n\nthe IX century A.D. in Iraq, to imitate the white porcelain from China. Due to its high refractive \n\nindex, small particle size and surface irregularity, tin oxide is an excellent opacifier. Later on, tin-\n\nopacified glazes started being produced in Egypt between the X \u2013 XI centuries A.D. At this time \n\nthe glazes were lead-alkali type, with lead oxide concentrations ranging 25-30% and 5-10% \n\nalkali [4]. From this point on, this glaze technology spread through the Islamic world in North \n\nAfrican and south European countries covering a big part of the Iberian Peninsula (Portugal and \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\nSpain). To Italy it reached via the island Mallorca, and, therefore, the Italian named Maiolica (or \n\nMajolica) to the type of glazed ceramics based on the tin-opacifying technology. The spreading \n\nto other European countries such as France was from Faenza (in the north of Italy) and the \n\nFrench named this type of objects Faience. In principle, both names are valid to classify them.  \n\nThis is an important point to turn to the objects under investigation in this work \u2013 \n\nPortuguese glazed ceramics. \n\n \n\n1.1 Glazed ceramics in Portugal \u2013 historical context \n\nFrom art historian point of view, the Islamic influence (661-750 A.D.) on Portuguese glazed \n\nceramics is well noticed particularly in the recipes for ceramic production. Azulejos (wall tiles) \n\nand faiences are two examples with this technical influence.  \n\nFrom all the glazed ceramics in Portugal, the most famous ones are Azulejos (from Arabic: al \n\nzulayj, meaning \u201cpolished stone\u201d). These Azulejos, Portuguese wall tiles, characterized by their \n\nsquare shape and elaborated decorative motifs are used in many (old) buildings in Portugal. The \n\ndecorative motifs evolved between the Gothic and the Renaissance styles. Although these wall-\n\ntiles are also found in other countries like, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Turkey, Morocco and Iran, \n\nthey have assumed a special charisma in Portugal due to: i) their longevity in use (five centuries \n\nwith no interruption); ii) its application mode, as element that supports the architecture, \n\ncovering entire inner- and outer-walls; iii) the way it has been understood, not just as \n\ndecorative art but also as support for taste renovation and as creativity proof [5]. A brief \n\nchronology of the development of Azulejos in Portugal is given in annex 1.1 [6]. \n\nIn figure 1.1, a set of examples of the different uses for Azulejos in Portugal is shown. \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 \u2013 Examples of the use of Azulejos in Portugal: a) \u201cArmillary Sphere\u201d motif at the Carranca \n\ncourtyard in Sintra Palace [7]; b) pattern style at the main Church in Argoncilhe (Aveiro) [7]; c) Rococo \n\nstyle at the garden in Queluz palace [7]; d) Baroque style at the Congregados church in Porto (A. \n\nGuilherme, 2010); e) Publicity panel and street name in Abrantes [7]; f) Publicity panel in Bom Jesus \n\n(Braga) (A. Guilherme, 2010). \n\n \n\nGiven the development of Azulejos in Portugal, an important stage was in the mid XVI \n\ncentury, where a change of artistic taste in this matter was experienced. The embossed work in \n\nAzulejos became \u201cold-fashioned\u201d and a new wave of manufacturing appears. Pieces with flat, \n\nfine glazed surfaces (faiences) turned to be the \u201cmodern\u201d style of glazed ceramics. This is the \n\ntime where the first Azulejos with painted decoration (by Portuguese artists) appeared [6]. \n\nOther types of objects hereby investigated are utility faiences for domestic use, such as \n\nplates, vases, bowls, etc. Regarding faiences, Portugal has a big variety of factories (or \n\npotteries) and based on documental (non-scientific) proofs, the possibility that the different \n\nmanufacturing centers adopted slightly different techniques has emerged [8]. One of the most \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nintriguing production centers is Coimbra. However, the lack of (scientific) data has raised \n\nmislabeling questions, which will be better explained in the next sections. Moreover, this \n\ninvestigation serves as a contribution to the missing scientific information. Just by 2007, a \n\ncomplete documental (and partially scientific) compilation about the Coimbra glazed ceramic \n\nproduction was published (in Portuguese) [9], but a good overview (in English) of the \n\nimportance of faiences in Portugal is given in [10]. \n\nStill regarding the book of Pais et al. [9] one can find a detailed insight about the chronology \n\nrelated to faience production within Coimbra district. A whole list of potters and families \n\nprotagonist of this type production is given, as well as stylist changes that have taken place \n\nbetween the XVI and XIX centuries. One of the most interesting facts is the lack of production \n\nindicatives before the ceramic factories appeared in this region. This is a strong hint that until \n\nthat time, the ceramic objects were produced by craftsmen, mainly illiterate, who were not \n\neven aware of the craft and at that time the value of their productions was inexistent. Due to all \n\nof these difficulties, and as a first step for investigation, excavations at the places connected to \n\n\u201cancient\u201d pottery workshops were executed, namely at the Convento de Santa Clara-a-Velha \n\nand at the Museu Machado de Castro (MMC). The retrieved fragments there represent a \n\nconcrete set of \u201cancient\u201d samples. The term \u201cancient\u201d is here connected to the fact that they \n\nare in the context of the earliest known Portuguese faience pieces (and therefore the oldest) \n\nproduced in Portugal. \n\nA brief chronology of art historical development regarding faiences from Coimbra is given in \n\nannex 1.2 [9]. From this description the main features characteristic of the faiences from \n\nCoimbra are: glazes more mate than the ones from Lisbon (for example); the use of earthy \n\nmate tones in which yellows tend to orange and blues tend to violet; the dark purple contours; \n\nembossed decorative motifs, which together with their lack of brightness suggest a third firing \n\nstage; and as a final remark the less use of oriental motifs, as it is known for the pieces from \n\nLisbon [8, 9]. \n\nAnother interesting fact is the strong influence of Spanish and Italian tin-glazes \n\nearthenwares in Portugal, especially from the quantity of faience produced in the XVII century. \n\nThe most characteristic pieces from this period are decorated based on the exported Chinese \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\nporcelain style. In fact, the Portuguese were the first Europeans to manufacture imitations of \n\nChinese export porcelain in faience, preceding the Dutch with their \u2018Kraak\u2019 porcelain [10]. \n\nCiting the Portuguese ceramist, Joaquim de Vasconcelos, on faiences from Coimbra: \u201cThe \n\nonly one in Portugal representing the oriental tradition and preserving characteristics from the \n\nIslamic style\u201d. The colored motifs (\u2026) produce a unique effect at ones sight, gives to this \n\nceramics an archaic aspect, which is impossible to confuse it with any other region\u201d [9]. Figure \n\n1.2 shows some examples of utility faience objects produced in Coimbra. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 \u2013 Examples of faiences from Coimbra: a) Tray from mid XVII century, 6 x ? 27 cm (present \n\nlocation: Museu Municipal de Viana do Castelo \u2013 MMVC \u2013 in Viana do Castelo); b) Plate from late XVII \n\ncentury, 5.3 x ? 33.6 cm (present location: Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga \u2013 MNAA \u2013 in Lisbon);c) Plate \n\n1\nst\n\n half of XVIII century, 6.2 x ? 39 cm (present location: MMVC \u2013 in Viana do Castelo); d) Plate from late \n\nXVIII century, 4.8 x ? 27.4 cm (present location: MMVC \u2013 in Viana do Castelo); e) Bottle from late XVIII \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\ncentury, 25.2 x ? 16 cm (present location: Museu Nacional Machado de Castro \u2013 MNMC \u2013 in Coimbra; f) \n\nWall deposit from late XVIII century, 36.8 x 24 cm (present location:  MNAA \u2013 in Lisbon) [9] (all photos by \n\nA. Guilherme, 2008).  \n\n \n\n1.2 Description of the analyzed samples \u2013 origin and features \n\nThe sample set chosen for this investigation comprises two ceramic production centers: \n\nCoimbra and Lisbon. All samples belong to the class of Majolica (or faience) and two types are \n\nincluded: Azulejos (from Coimbra and Lisbon) and utility faiences (from Coimbra). All belong to \n\nthe time period of XVI-XVIII centuries. The assignation to the manufacturing centre is based on \n\nthe stylistic features that the pieces exhibit, according to documental proofs. Some of the \n\npieces, at least the most erudite ones, have even potter trade-marks, which makes it easier to \n\ncompare the artistic styles and assign the samples to Coimbra or to Lisbon. \n\nThe Azulejo samples (produced in Coimbra and Lisbon) were provided by the Museu \n\nNacional do Azulejo \u2013 MNAz (Wall-tile National Museum in Lisbon), while the collection of \n\nutility faience samples (produced in Coimbra) were retrieved from the Mosteiro de Santa Clara-\n\na-Velha (Santa Clara-a-Velha Monastery) in Coimbra. A list of the analyzed samples, describing \n\ntheir origin, estimated date of production and features observed by naked-eye, is presented in \n\nannex 1.3. In technical terms all of these pieces are characterized by three main parts: i) \n\nceramic support (body); ii) glaze; iii) surface decoration, as indicated in figure 1.3. The \n\nmicrograph of the cross-section was taken with a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) at the \n\nFederal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (BAM \u2013 Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr \n\nMaterialforschung und \u2013pr\u00fcfung, Berlin, Germany \u2013 division 6.8:  Surface Analysis and \n\nInterfacial Chemistry) (cf. chapter 3, section 3.3). \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.3 \u2013 Scanning Electron Microscopy micrograph of a ceramic sample in cross-section taken at \n\nBAM (division 6.8 \u2013 Surface Analysis and Interfacial Chemistry). The three main parts characteristic of all \n\nsamples are observable: surface decoration, glaze and ceramic support. \n\n \n\n1.2.1 Ceramic support / body \n\nThe ceramic support is characterized mainly by clay minerals, Silicon (Si) and Aluminum (Al) \n\noxides (with particle size ? 2 \u00b5m in diameter) and non-plastic inclusions (temper). Clay minerals \n\nconfer plasticity, which is necessary for molding the material [2]. These are basically alumina-\n\nsilicate hydrated minerals (Al2O3?SiO2?H2O) with lower quantities of other oxides, such as TiO2, \n\nFe2O3, MgO, CaO, Na2O and K2O. Silica (SiO2) has a structural role in the body and it is the \n\nrefractory component, as it has a very high melting point (1600 \u2013 1725 \u00b0C). The temper \n\ninclusions can be natural impurities within the clay minerals or added by the potter in order to \n\nchange the properties of the ceramic material so that it could be easier to shape it and become \n\nmore consistent [11]. \n\nThe elements (or compounds) that hold a more informative character are the ones which are \n\nformed from igneous rocks and this is strongly dependent on the geology of the region [12]. \n\nImportant minerals for the formation of igneous rocks are feldspars, quartz, olivines, \n\npyroxenes, amphiboles and micas.  \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nFeldspars are alumina-silicates (SiO2 and Al2O3) and constitute 39% of the earth\u00b4s crust. \n\nPotassium (K), sodium (Na) and calcium (Ca) are other elements which are present in feldspars \n\nas well. They are responsible for the division between potash or alkali feldspars (with K: \n\northoclase and microcline) and soda-lime feldspars (different relative quantities of Na and Ca: \n\nAlbite, Oligoclase, Andesine, Labradorite, Bytownite and Anorthite) namely plagioclases. During \n\nthe process of weathering, all the minerals in igneous rocks form clays, and different kinds of \n\ndecomposition procedures form different clays [2]. There are still other elements (so-called \n\n\u201caccessory\u201d elements) that can either positively or negatively alter the properties of the paste, \n\nsuch as metallic sulphides, carbonates, sulphates, other salts and organic matter [13]. \n\nApart from the chemical interactions within the water/clay system, physical and chemical \n\ncharacteristics are altered when the paste is submitted to a firing process. These alterations are \n\nfunction of three variables: firing cycle, temperature and atmosphere [2]. The atmosphere \n\nrefers to the gases that are present while the paste is being heated and cooled down. If the \n\nwhole process is taken place under a free air circulation and oxygen to bind with the elements, \n\nthe atmosphere is said oxidizing; while if oxygen is lacking, the atmosphere is said reducing. \n\nThis is important since the atmosphere during the firing affects the final product in terms of \n\ncolor, hardness, porosity and shrinkage [2, 13]. \n\nRegarding some of the most common components of the body, the first phenomenon under \n\nthe first heat action (below 300?C) is the loss of water which was not expelled during the drying \n\nprocess. The second important stage, between 300 \u2013 600 ?C, is the dehidroxilation, which \n\nmeans that, at the end of this stage, the loss of plasticity is irreversible. Organic components \n\nstart oxidizing at 200 \u2013 300 ?C, which increases exponentially at temperatures around 600 \u2013 800 \n\n?C and together with the water elimination there is an increase in porosity that allows an intake \n\nof air into the piece. At 573?C there happens the so-called \u201cquartz inversion\u201d. From 800 ?C the \n\npores start closing and the material starts contracting. Between 800 \u2013 950 ?C the \n\ndecomposition of calcium and magnesium carbonates takes place and from 900 ?C vitrification \n\nphenomena starts occurring, which confers resistance to the material. So, in clayey materials \n\nthe mechanical resistance is owed to the formation of glassy phases, mainly due to the fuser \n\nmaterials within the paste [1, 13-15]. \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\nAll these transformations occur with the variation of temperature (or volume), which allows \n\nto infer about these phenomena, for example using X-ray Diffraction (XRD) (cf. chapter 3, \n\nsection 3.2).In the case of faiences the firing temperature used for the ceramic body goes up to \n\n950 \u2013 1200 ?C. The bisque (after firing) has a dim and opaque appearance, with low \n\ndeformation, owed to the lower content in fuser elements. Faience ceramic bodies have a \n\nhigher mechanical resistance in comparison to the ball-clay ones. They have also an early \n\nvitrification phase, which makes it more difficult to have a good fit between body and glaze. \n\n \n\n1.2.2 Glaze \n\nGlazes are composed by three main categories of components: i) network formers, ii) \n\nnetwork modifiers (fluxes) and iii) intermediates. Every one of these components is important \n\nfor the properties of the final product.  \n\nThe network formers, as the name itself suggests, create the structure and this is achieved \n\nby silica (SiO2). The network modifiers (fluxes) are oxides that are introduced in the tetrahedral \n\nstructure of silica. These oxides have longer ionic radii than the ones of silica, which weakens \n\nthe network connections, lowering the melting point of the system. The most common fluxes \n\nare Na2O, K2O, PbO, CaO and MgO. The intermediates are oxides that substitute part of silica \n\nand have one or both of the functions: \n\n- Increase the glaze viscosity, which was lost by the introduction of fluxes; \n\n- Strengthen the glaze during the firing process, avoiding fissures. \n\nCommon intermediates are Al2O3, PbO, ZnO, ZrO2 and CdO. There is also a fourth category, \n\nthe opacifiers, which make the glaze more opaque. As it was mentioned previously tin (Sn) is \n\none of the best opacifiers and it is commonly found in the composition of Maiolica objects. The \n\nintroduction of such components promotes the application of surface decoration onto the \n\nglazed pieces. \n\nDuring the firing process these components react with each other and fuse to form the glaze \n\nlayer. It can be fired simultaneously with the body (mono-firing) or fired after applied onto the \n\nbisque (bi-firing). In the case of the samples hereby studied, all glazes were applied onto the \n\nfired ceramic support and fired in an own stage. The surface decoration could have been \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\napplied together with the base glaze onto the bisque or applied onto the glazed piece \n\nsubmitted to own firing stage, where the whole piece undergoes a third firing procedure. This is \n\nstill an open question.  \n\nThe glazes used for ceramics are a kind of glass, which is a non-crystalline substance cooled \n\nrapidly. Glazes are viscous coatings that are fused at high temperatures over a ceramic body \n\nand during the cooling process they solidify without the formation of a crystalline structure and \n\nretain some characteristics of a liquid. In fact glazes represent a mixture between amorphous \n\nand crystalline phases [2, 16] (figure 1.4). \n\n \n\nFigure 1.4 \u2013 Illustration of a crystalline material with theoretical composition of A2O3 (left) and \n\namorphous arrangement of A2O3 (right) if the material is cooled down rapidly. The dashed lines \n\nsurround 24 black dots and 36 open circles, representing the same chemical composition in both figures. \n\nThe amorphous structure occupies a larger volume in comparison to the crystalline one [16]. \n\n \n\nFigure 1.5 shows what happens to a material with the insertion of network modifiers. \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.5 \u2013 Insertion of network modifiers cations (larger grey filled circles) in the glass structure \n\n[17].  \n\n  \n\nGlazes are normally applied in an aqueous suspension form either by submersion, or with a \n\nbrush. After the water is absorbed through the pores of the body a sort of dusty layer remains \n\non the surface [16, 17]. Once fired at sufficiently high temperature this layer forms an \n\nimpermeable, more or less shiny glassy surface. During the firing process several phenomena \n\noccur, such as the decomposition of the raw materials (which were not fritted before) by the \n\nrelease of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the carbonates; dissolution of some compounds and \n\nseparation of non-mixable phases. During the cooling process some substances crystallize and \n\nthe glaze hardens. \n\nThe properties of glazes depend, of course, on the chemical composition. The higher the \n\namount of silica the harder the glaze is but it needs a higher firing temperature. The oxides that \n\nact as fluxes have a stronger effect the shorter the cation is. Level of fusibility or fusing power \n\nvaries using different alkaline oxides in the following order: \n\nLiO2> PbO > Na2O > K2O > BaO > CaO > SrO > MgO > ZnO \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\nYet, the presence of these oxides can be harmful since it diminishes the mechanical and \n\nchemical resistance of glazes and increase the thermal expansion coefficient\n2\n. Here the \n\nintroduction of the so-called \u201cnetwork stabilizers\u201d is necessary. \n\nTaking all of these issues into account, glazes should have the following properties: \n\n? Moderate viscosity, to avoid differences in thicknesses especially in irregular surfaces; \n\n? The reaction between ceramic paste and glaze should be moderate in order to \n\nminimize the compounds exchange. \n\n? The relationship between expansion coefficient and elasticity module (Young)\n3\n of the \n\nglaze should be towards a maximal resistance. \n\n? It should be chemically stable, homogeneous, and abrasion resistant. \n\nAfter applying the glaze either by submersion, or with a brush, onto the ceramic body, the \n\npiece is fired.  \n\n \n\n1.2.3 Surface decoration \n\nFrom all the analyzed samples, and from documental proofs [9], the base colors used for the \n\nsurface decoration in Portuguese glazed ceramics are: blue, dark purple, yellow (and brown) \n\nand green \u2013 in rare cases. Different mixtures and concentrations (pigment to volume ratio) of \n\nthe raw materials for the pigments result in different hues. For example different hues of blue \n\nand yellow were found among the sample set. Based on the colors used, the palette of \n\ninorganic pigments is broad as it is described in table 1.2. \n\n  \n\n                                                           \n2\n Thermal expansion coefficient: Thermal expansion is the tendency of matter to change in volume in response to a \n\nchange in temperature. The degree of expansion divided by the change in temperature is called the material's \n\ncoefficient of thermal expansion. \n3\n Young\u00b4s module: For the description of the elastic properties of objects, which are either stretched or \n\ncompressed, a convenient parameter is the ratio of the stress to the strain, a parameter called the Young's \nmodulus of the material. \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\nTable 1.2 \u2013 Inorganic pigments with their chemical formula as well as key-elements. \n\nColor Pigment name Chemical formula Key-element(s) \n\nBlue \n\nAzurite 2CuCO3\u00b7Cu(OH)2 Cu \n\nCerulean blue CoO\u00b7SnO2 Co, Sn \n\nCobalt blue CoO\u00b7Al2O3 Al, Co \n\nCobalt violet Co3(PO4)2 Co \n\nEgyptian blue CaO\u00b7CuO\u00b74SiO2 Si, Ca, Cu \n\nManganese blue BaSO4\u00b7Ba3(MnO4)2 Mn, Ba \n\nPrussian blue Fe4[Fe(CN)6]c3 Fe \n\nSmalt Co-glass (K2O,SiO2,CoO) Si, K, Co \n\nUltramarine Na8\u201310Al6Si6O24S2\u20134 Na, Al, Si, S \n\nYellow \n\nAuripigment As2S3 As \n\nCadmium yellow  CdS Cd \n\nChrome yellow  2PbSO4\u00b7PbCrO4 Cr \n\nCobalt yellow  K3[Co(NO2)6]\u00b71.5H2O K, Co \n\nLead-tin yellow  Pb2SnO4/PbSn12xSixO7 Sn \n\nMassicot  PbO Pb \n\nNaples yellow  Pb(SbO3)2/Pb3(SbO4)2 Sb, Pb \n\nStrontium yellow  SrCrO4 Cr, Sr \n\nTitanium yellow  NiO\u00b7Sb2O3\u00b720TiO2 Ti, Ni, Sb \n\nYellow ochre  Fe2O3\u00b7nH2O (20\u201370%) Fe \n\nZinc yellow  K2O\u00b74ZnO\u00b74CrO3\u00b73H2O Cr, Zn \n\nGreen \n\nBasic copper \nsulphate \n\nCux(SO4)y(OH)z Cu \n\nChromium oxide  Cr2O3 Cr \n\nChrysocolla CuSiO3\u00b7nH2O Cu \n\nCobalt green  CoO\u00b75ZnO Co, Zn \n\nEmerald green  \nCu(CH3COO)2\u00b73Cu(AsO2\n\n)2 \nCu, As \n\nGuignent green  Cr2O3\u00b7nH2O + H3BO3 Cr \n\nMalachite  CuCO3\u00b7Cu(OH)2 Cu \n\nVerdigris  Cu(CH3COO)2\u00b7nCu(OH)2 Cu \n\nBlack; purple \n\nBlack iron oxide  FeO\u00b7Fe2O3 Fe \n\nCobalt black  CoO Co \n\nIvory black  C + Ca3(PO4)2 P, Ca \n\nManganese oxide  MnO + Mn2O3 Mn \n\n \n\n During the XVIII century it was common that each workshop prepares its own colors and \n\nhues and kept it as a secret [9]. This is a challenge for such investigations, as there is a need for \n\nfinding adequate strategies for reconstructing manufacturing procedures used.  \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\nFrom table 1.2 one can see that at a first approach, having elemental information only can \n\nbe difficult in assigning the pigment that has been used. Nonetheless, given the time of \n\nmanufacture and resources available, some hints can be given about the pigments used for \n\nsurface decoration. For example, the source for the blue may have been Smalt, for the yellow \n\nthe Naples Yellow and for the purple the Manganese oxide [9], as highlighted in table 1.2. \n\nHowever, the mixture of pigments to obtain the desired hues can be dependent on the \n\nproduction center and the special case of the Naples Yellow seems to require a deeper \n\nunderstanding on the type which was used [18, 19].  \n\nNaples yellow is a synthetically generated pigment produced by initial raw materials, which \n\ncould have been sulphides, oxides or metals. Dik et al. [20] investigated whether the yellow \n\npigment was produced from sulphides, oxides or metals. Three mixtures of Naples Yellow were \n\ncalcinated\n4\n at 900 ?C: (1) minium (Pb3O4) + Stibnite (Sb2S3); (2) Pb3O4 + Sb2O3; and (3) Pb \n\nmetallic + Sb metallic. The tests showed advantage of the oxides mixture (2) over the other two, \n\nas it produced almost pure lead antimonate yellow.  \n\nThe work of Maggetti et al. [19] resumes the topology of four yellow mixtures used in glass \n\nmanufacturers as well as in paintings, based on previous investigations on each one. These \n\nmixtures are: (1) cubic lead antimonate yellow (mineral: bindheimite), Pb2Sb2O7; (2) \n\northorhombic lead-tin yellow I, Pb2SnO4; (3) cubic lead-tin yellow II, PbSn1-xSixO3; and (4) cubic \n\nlead-tin antimonate yellow (a Pb-Sn-Sb solid solution), Pb2Sb2-xSnxO6.5. In most ceramic glazes, \n\nlead antimonate is commonly found as coloring and opacifying agent [21, 22]. However, hints \n\nabout the recipes used for this pigment production can be analytically identified by tracing the \n\npresence of other elements such as Al, Si, Fe or Zn. One way of predicting which of the four \n\nyellow mixtures was used is by the Sb/Pb weight ratio. If no other minor compounds are \n\npresent in the yellow crystal structure, a stoichiometric composition of 58 wt% PbO and 42 wt% \n\nSb2O5 is expected, if Pb2Sb2O7 was used as yellow pigment. This corresponds to a PbO/Sb2O5 \n\nratio of 1.38 [19]. Further important informations are related to pigment thermal stability. \n\nYellow mixtures (2) and (3) are thermally stable only up to 900 \u2013 950 ?C firing temperature \n\n                                                           \n4\n Calcination: a thermal treatment process in which the compounds are heated below their fusing point, causing \n\ndecomposition of carbonates, among others. \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\nwhile mixtures (1) and (4) are thermally stable up to 1100 ?C. The latter two would easily \n\nwithstand temperatures of a second firing process (950 \u2013 1050 ?C) [19]. \n\nAnother important factor that serves as a manufacturing production hint is the way the \n\npigment was obtained. Such opaque glazed ceramic pigments could have been produced in two \n\ndifferent ways according to Maggetti et al. [19], as shown in figure 1.6. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.6 \u2013 Production steps of opaque glazed ceramic colors [19] \n\n \n\nDifferences at the microscopic level are expected whether method A or B is chosen. In \n\nmethod A the pigments were subjected to high temperatures for an extended period and \n\ndissolution phenomena should have taken place; hence, more spherical or rounded-edge \n\npigments grains are expected. In method B the pigments were fixed into the glassy matrix in the \n\nhigh temperature firing only \u2013 which implies that the pigment has less time left to react with \n\nglassy matrix; and the original pigment grain  shape is preserved [19].  \n\nAt this point one expects to have two main possible configurations regarding the base-\n\nglaze/color system. In figure 1.7 a schematic representation of both is shown.  \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.7 \u2013 Schematic representation of the two possible stratigraphic arrangements: a) three \n\ndistinct layers (body, base glaze and color) or b) two layers (body and glaze+color). \n\n \n\nFor the particular case of opacified-colors, they were probably prepared as a frit (cf. figure \n\n1.6) and therefore submitted to a third firing stage, which could lead to the situation in figure \n\n1.7a. Conversely, pigment and base-glaze were submitted to the same firing stage (second), \n\nwhich would lead to the case in figure 1.7b. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\nCHAPTER 2 \u2013 OBJECTIVES OF THE WORK \n\nThis work deals with polychrome glazed ceramics originally produced in the two main \n\nPortuguese manufacturing centers (Coimbra and Lisbon) between the XVI and XVIII centuries.  \n\nWith the premise of overcome mislabeling of objects that are not properly identified \u2013 either by \n\npotters marks or clear manufacturing tracers with unambiguous assignation \u2013 this investigation \n\naddresses to gain knowledge concerning manufacturing technological aspects by a \n\nmultianalytical (non-destructive) approach. Literature survey shows a gap in scientific \n\ninvestigations concerning faiences produced in Coimbra, therefore a special output of this \n\nresearch work is to serve as a contribution \u2013 if not a basis \u2013 for the classification of \u201cFaience \n\nfrom Coimbra\u201d.  \n\nAn important aspect is the choice of various analytical methods for the sough answers. For \n\nthis purpose it is crucial to understand the advantages and limitations of each analytical \n\nmethod in order to extract results and conclusions as accurate as possible. This is briefed in the \n\nlast section of this chapter. \n\n \n\n2.1 The necessity for investigation \n\nAccording to the Portuguese history and traditions, glazed ceramics hold great artistic value \n\nbased on the descriptions above and many more. This type of art has represented not only \n\nbeauty to one\u2019s eye but also a symbol of the influence from other nations as it has changed \n\nthrough times. Moreover, it has been a symbol of wealth for some and due to the importance \n\nin developing new manufacturing processes it has became a symbol of secrecy between \n\ndifferent production centers. Taking this into account, information about the manufacturing \n\nprocesses is missing and from this point of view this investigation is important in order to fill \n\nthe existing gaps.  \n\nAnother issue is related to ceramic production in Coimbra, in particular. As it has been stated \n\n[9], there was always a difference between the two main ceramic production centers (Lisbon \n\nand Coimbra), at least in stylistic terms. In addition, Lisbon being the capital city, the monetary \n\nresources for such industry were larger and Coimbra has been known as a less wealthy \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\nproduction center. Therefore, it has been thought that the expensive raw materials were \n\nspared as much as possible, which would imply a much broader range of materials in order to \n\nproduce a single color or hue. One example is given by the blue pigments, in which the source \n\nof cobalt; smalt (a ground blue containing Cobalt), is the main and the most expensive mineral. \n\nIn the samples from Coimbra, additional elements can be found, such as manganese (Mn) to \n\nspare the cobalt source. \n\nAn additional point is the fact that there are many pieces found with no labeling, which \n\nfacilitates the erroneous assignation to a production center. Hence, the intrinsic value of a \n\npiece is put at stake, as based on historical and art historical facts \u201conly\u201d several opinions have \n\nbeen developed about e.g. the use of raw materials and manufacturing processes. \n\nRegarding all the information above, it is of primary importance to have samples with \n\nunequivocal origin (pottery labels) to serve as a reference group for the whole investigation. \n\nThis way one can validate a group and find similarities or dissimilarities between the samples \n\nfrom different production centers. This work is pioneer in terms of scientific criteria for such \n\nvaluable pieces, improving the knowledge about Portuguese Cultural Heritage. \n\n \n\n2.2 Analytical requirements \n\nThe field of natural sciences applied to Cultural Heritage objects (also known as \n\nArchaeometry) has grown tremendously in the past decades, indicated by the big number of \n\npublications available. Concerning ceramic studies only, some examples can be found [21, 23-\n\n39]. \n\n The fact that most of the times the object cannot be taken away from its place (museum, \n\nbuilding, etc.), triggered the fast development of portable equipment \u2013 as it is the case of X-ray \n\nFluorescence (XRF) setups. In comparison to stationary equipment, portable XRF setups \n\ncomprise low power X-ray tubes and X-ray detectors with a technology without external cooling \n\n(cf. chapter 3). Another issue is the growing demand for smaller spot sizes of analysis in order \n\nto resolve details in the sub-millimeter range. Hence, for example, the development of micro-\n\nfocus X-ray tubes together with optical X-ray elements is evident, enabling beam focusing down \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\nto the micrometer scale. Nowadays, several optical systems providing analysis at these ranges \n\nare found (cf. chapter 3).  \n\nYet, the information obtained by the methods that allow portable setups is most of the \n\ntimes not enough for conclusive investigations. Information at other levels is also required and \n\nin that case only stationary systems are possible so far due to technical constrains. In this case a \n\ncompromise has to be found and minimal sampling can be performed. Regarding this matter, X-\n\nray Absorption (XAS) techniques became also very popular among Cultural Heritage (CH) \n\nobjects [23]. This specific method is optimal for samples with high heterogeneity, as it provides \n\nhigh-sensitive chemical information (atom specific) irrespective of the complexity of the \n\nsystem. However, for this purpose the use of a high-brilliant X-ray source is required, such as in \n\na synchrotron. The drawback of using synchrotron radiation is that one requires a beamtime \n\napplication and, if accepted, the allowed beamtime is rather limited \u2013 most of the times not \n\nenough to have sufficient results. The tendency nowadays is to try to produce such high \n\nbrilliant sources on a laboratory scale, allowing an \u201cuncomplicated\u201d use. This is, for example, \n\none of the goals of BLiX \u2013 Berlin Laboratories for innovative X-ray technologies (at the Technical \n\nUniversity of Berlin). It is still in a development process, but for example XAS measurements are \n\nalready feasible for certain types of samples \u2013 mainly biological (http://www.blix.tu-berlin.de/). \n\nThe objects hereby investigated have great compositional variability, so there is a need for a \n\nmulti-analytical approach. The analytical methods chosen have to be able to provide \n\ninformation about the chemical (or compositional) nature of the different parts of these \n\nartefacts, in order to identify raw materials. It is important here to remark that this approach is \n\nused for the objectives of this research work, and although it can be part of a scientific \n\napproach for provenance purposes but it should not be exclusively consider for this purpose. \n\nEven if the samples under investigation are fragments, these are artistic and historical objects \n\nplaying a significant role in the context of Portuguese Cultural Heritage. Therefore the analytical \n\nrequirements can be numbered in the following way: \n\n? Non-destructive: in terms of keeping the physical integrity of glaze and surface decoration; \n\nthe ceramic body (when exposed) is quite thick and if sampling is required for this part it would \n\nnot represent a problem; \n\nhttp://www.blix.tu-berlin.de/\n\n\n27 \n \n\n? Sensitive: in terms of the sough analytical answers; each method does not have to provide \n\n\u201call\u201d the information required but it should be sensitive to the specific need. \n\n? Versatile: in order to obtain information at different scales using the same technique, \n\nwhich in this case would be from millimeter (mm) down to micrometer (\u00b5m) scale, and if \n\npossible, being able to analyze objects with different sizes, shapes and surface morphology.  \n\nAll spectroscopic methods used for studying CH material based on X-ray, ultraviolet (UV), \n\nvisible (VIS) and infrared (IR) radiation tend to be non-destructive. In many of CH objects a \n\ndetailed surface decoration is visible, so one should aim for analytical systems that provide \n\nenough lateral resolution (&lt;1 mm\n2\n) [40]. Furthermore, these objects have somewhat a layered \n\nsystem (or better explained, an interface system) and this is with most of the techniques a \n\nchallenge for investigation. Therefore, depth resolved methods would provide useful \n\ninformation in this case and cancel out information overlap obtained in the conventional way. \n\nTaking the above into account (and also based on the expected variability in these samples), \n\nwithin the group of non-destructive techniques, methods providing elemental, compositional, \n\nmineralogical and textural information are also needed. \n\nAs a good practice, one should start with the method that provides a fast and broad range of \n\nelemental information. An example that fulfills quite well these requirements is X-ray \n\nFluorescence (XRF) spectrometry (cf. chapter 3, section 3.1). It is a well-established method for \n\ninnumerous applications and, although there is a vast number of publications using this \n\ntechnique, a recent work by Tsuji et al. [41] gives an excellent overview about such applications. \n\nAs a complement, techniques that provide mineralogical and textural information are \n\nrequired. For this purpose, X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy with an \n\nattached Energy Dispersive X-ray System (SEM/EDX) are suitable (cf. chapter 3, section 3.2 and \n\n3.3). The latter will be especially useful for cross-section analyses that comprise \n\nbody/glaze/color in order to evaluate the interaction between these interfaces. This provides \n\nhints about the glazing process. At last, one must consider that changes in the chemical \n\nenvironment of some compounds may occur, which are indicative for differences in the \n\nmanufacturing processes. Therefore X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS), a method sensitive \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\nto the chemical environment of a certain atom, was also chosen for this investigation (cf. \n\nchapter 3, section 3.4) \n\n  \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \u2013 METHODS OF ANALYSIS \n\n \n\nConsidering the objectives of this work, the chosen analytical methods were: X-ray \n\nFluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy / Energy Dispersive X-\n\nray System (SEM/EDX) and X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS). Therefore, this chapter is \n\ndivided into four sections, each one dedicated to each of the mentioned techniques, pointing \n\nout the physical concepts and analytical features \u2013 enhancing advantages and limitations for \n\nthe present investigation. Furthermore, a description of the experimental setup used is also \n\nprovided in each section.  \n\n \n\n3.1 X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy (XRF) \n\nAs previously explained, XRF has innumerous advantages for the investigation of CH-related \n\nobjects. XRF has undergone huge advances in the last decades improving both excitation and \n\ndetection conditions, as well as the environment in which the whole analysis take place. One of \n\nthe most significant upgrading resulted by the advent of X-ray optics devices, allowing XRF \n\nanalysis at the micrometer scale. Concerning CH-related objects this was a great improvement, \n\nas it resolves tiny details both lateral and in depth. Several textbooks cover the fundamentals of \n\nthis method \u2013 in its variants \u2013 in detail [42, 43].  \n\nIn the course of this work two variants of energy-dispersive XRF were used, conventional- \n\nand 3D Micro-XRF. Each of which will be covered in the second and third sub-sections, \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\n3.1.1 XRF principles \n\nWhen interacting with matter and given their energy range (&lt;1 MeV), X-rays undergo mainly \n\nabsorption (photoelectric absorption) or scattering phenomena (Compton and Rayleigh), both \n\nof which will be described in the following sub-sections.  Considering a parallel monochromatic \n\nX-ray beam of intensity I0 that impinges on a given homogeneous material (absorber), the \n\ntransmitted beam \u2013 after passing through the absorber of thickness x \u2013 will have a reduced \n\n\n\n30 \n \n\nintensity Ix due to absorption and scattering phenomena [44]. This attenuation process is \n\ndescribed by the Lambert-Beer law according to: \n\n                                             (3.1) \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 \u2013 Schematic representation of the attenuation of X-rays through a material (absorber). \n\n \n\nwhere      is the linear attenuation coefficient of the material for a specific wavelength. \n\nKnowing the density of the material, ?, the mass of material in a unit section (white circle on \n\nfigure 3.1) becomes       . So, equation 3.2 can be re-written in the following way: \n\n             \n    \n\n \n                          (3.2) \n\nand for          , equation 3.3 becomes: \n\n                                              (3.3) \n\n\u00b5 is the mass attenuation coefficient, as it refers to the mass of the material per unit section \n\nand it is expressed in cm\n2\n.g\n\n-1\n [44].  \n\nIf one atom covers an area of ?Atom (cm\n2\n) within a beam of monochromatic photons with a \n\ncross-section of 1 cm\n2\n, the practical unit is (10\n\n?24\n cm\n\n2\n) = (barns/atom) (figure 3.2). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 \u2013 Atomic cross-section, mass attenuation, linear attenuation [45]. \n\nThe total atomic cross-section comprises all three possible ways of interaction and is thereby \n\nan attenuation coefficient given by: \n\n                                                      (3.4) \n\nEach of these terms will be described in the following sub-sections. \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\n3.1.1.1 Photoelectric absorption \n\nWhen X-rays of suitable energy impinge onto a sample, energy is transferred to core \n\nelectrons and these can be ejected resulting in an excited atom with a vacancy in the inner \n\norbital shell. The atom then reorganizes itself by successive vacancy-filling processes until it \n\nreturns to its fundamental state. This means that a potential loss takes place and can be \n\nreleased by emission of fluorescent photons or by Auger transitions [42, 46]. The energy of \n\neach emitted photon equals the energy difference between the levels in which the transition \n\nhas occurred. These fluorescent X-rays are characteristic for each transition in each atom \n\n(figure 3.3). The allowed transitions \u2013 according Hund\u00b4s rules \u2013 are organized in many tables \n\naccording their intensity. For example, the most intense characteristic line corresponds always \n\nto the transition between L3 \u2013 K (according the IUPAC notation), which is denoted as K?1, \n\nunder the Siegbahn notation.  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 \u2013 Schematics of the transitions between the atomic energy levels that give rise to the \n\ncharacteristic XRF lines. Both Siegbahn and IUPAC notations are displayed [47].  \n\n \n\nFor the X-rays energy range considered (&lt;1 MeV), the photoelectric absorption coefficient \n\naccounts for at least 95% of the whole attenuation coefficient (\u00b5Atom, total) [44]. This means that \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\nthe experimental values of the attenuation coefficient reflect majorly the properties of the \n\nphotoelectric coefficient. For a given element, ? increases, i.e. the probability of a photon \n\nejecting an electron from an atom increases with decreasing energy, within certain limits \u2013 \n\nwhich are characterized by sharp discontinuities that can be observed in any absorption curve \n\n[44]. An example is shown in figure 3.4 \u2013 photoelectric absorption coefficient of Pb. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 \u2013 Photoelectric absorption coefficient of Pb as a function of photon energy [48]. \n\n \n\n3.1.1.2 Scattering \n\nAs previously mentioned, there are two types of scattering processes taking place in the \n\nphoton-atom interaction: Compton (incoherent or inelastic) and Rayleigh (coherent or elastic) \n\nscattering. In the former energy and momentum are not conserved, which means that there is \n\na change in energy and phase of the photon, while in the latter energy and momentum are \n\nconserved. The probability for Compton scattering increases for higher photon energies and \n\nlower atomic number (Z) of the scattering atom, while the probability for Rayleigh scattering \n\nbehaves exactly vice-versa. \n\n \n\nIncoherent scattering \n\nIt results from the interaction between an incident photon (     ) and a free electron \u2013 \n\nweakly bound to the atom (figure 3.5).  \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.5 \u2013 The Compton Effect. \n\n \n\nAn inelastic interaction takes place, which means that incident photon is deflected in the OB \n\ndirection with lower energy (E\u00b4) \u2013 at ? &lt;? - and the electron recoils in the OA direction \u2013 at ? &lt;\n\n?/2. This effect obeys to the laws of relativistic dynamics, so the principle of conservation of \n\nmomentum implies that the wavelength change of the scattered photon is [44]: \n\n          \n \n\n   \n                            (3.5) \n\nwith m0 being the mass of the electron at rest. Equation (3.5) is valid for all incident energies \n\nand any scattering atom. The pre-collision motion of the bound electron causes, due to the \n\nDoppler effect [49], a broadening of  the Compton peak, compared with the fluorescence \n\npeaks, which can be and described by: \n\n          \n \n\n \n                                                  (3.6) \n\nwith      . \n\n \n\nCoherent scattering \n\nIt is a process in which a photon interacts with a bound atomic electron without energy \n\ntransfer. The scattered photon has the same energy as the incoming photon and only the \n\ndirection is changed, leaving the atom neither ionized nor excited. The intensity of the radiation \n\nscattered by an atom is determined by summing the amplitudes of the radiation coherently \n\nscattered by each of the electrons bound in the atom. In Rayleigh scattering the coherence \n\nextends only over the Z electrons of individual atom and the interface is always constructive as \n\nlong as the change over the diameter of the atom is less than one-half of a wavelength [42] : \n\n  \n\n \n     \n\n \n\n \n                                     (3.7) \n\nwhere    is the effective radius of the atom. \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\nRayleigh scattering is dominant at low energy incident photons and high-Z atoms. \n\n \n\n3.1.2 Conventional XRF \n\nIn a simple form, in order to perform XRF analyses one needs an X-ray source and a suitable \n\ndetector. Nowadays a big variety of XRF setups are found, according to the requirements for \n\nthe investigations purposes. These setups can differ in the X-ray source, detector and some \n\nother devices used. \n\nAs previously explained, in addition to the emission of the characteristic radiation, several \n\nother X-ray interactions also occur. These interactions alter the overall appearance of the XRF \n\nspectrum, so it is vital to understand how these interactions occur when analyzing XRF spectra. \n\nMoreover, experimental artifacts mainly related to the detectors used for this purpose are \n\nvisible in XRF spectra as well. Both qualitative and quantitative information can be withdrawn \n\nfrom performing XRF analysis. However, as no quantitative treatment was performed in this \n\ninvestigation by means of XRF, focus will be only given to the qualitative information. \n\nXRF became possible due to the correlation between the energy of the fluorescence \n\nradiation E and the atomic number of the emitting element Z, proposed by Moseley, given as: \n\n                                                                 \n\nZ and ? are constants related to the observed fluorescent line. \n\n  XRF measurements performed in the so-called \u201cconventional\u201d way are referred to bulk \n\nanalysis, as it is shown in figure 3.6. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.6 \u2013 Sketch of a conventional XRF setup. \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\n3.1.2.1 Experimental setup and methodology \n\nThe spectrometer used for conventional XRF measurements belongs to the Atomic Physics \n\nCentre (Faculty of Sciences, University of Lisbon). Conventional XRF measurements were carried \n\nout in a 45\u00b0 tube-detector geometry setup enclosed in a chamber submitted to a 10 mbar \n\nvacuum (figure 3.7a). The X-ray tube is a Be sided-window (125 \u00b5m thick) model with a Mo-\n\nanode and take-off angle of 20?, from Oxford Instruments (California, USA); the detector is a \n\nVortex-60EX Silicon Drift Detector (SDD) with a 50mm\n2\n Si-area and 12.5 \u00b5m thick Be-window, \n\nfrom HITACHI USA Inc. (California, USA). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.7 \u2013 a) General view of the XRF experimental setup and b) the inside of the chamber [50] . \n\n \n\nInside the vacuum chamber (figure 3.7b) there is a motor stage which allows the incident \n\nradiation to be transmitted by means of a polycapillary full-lens from XOS (New York, USA) or a \n\ncollimator made out of brass.  The chamber is equipped with two laser pointers which overlap \n\nat the same position as the focus of the polycapillary and the detector axis. This allows \n\npositioning the sample at the proper distance of about 1.5 mm in front of the Kapton\nTM\n\n \n\nwindow. Due to this small distance the laser points as well as the spot of analysis can only be \n\nobserved with the built-in camera. \n\nThe efficiency of an X-ray tube is very low (between 0.1 \u2013 1%), due to the high thermal \n\nenergy dissipation at the anode. The total irradiated X-ray power can be       can be \n\nestimated according to: \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\n                                                \n\nwhere              ,   is related to the anode material,       is the anode current and \n\n      is the applied voltage. The maximum electric power of X-ray tubes can reach several kW \n\nfor most operations and up to 100 kW in a pulsed mode \u2013 like for medical applications [43]. This \n\nimplies that for many laboratory X-ray tubes a proper cooling system is crucial \u2013 in this case an \n\nair-cooling system was provided.  \n\nSilicon Drift Detectors (SDD) represent the latest technologic developments in collecting the \n\ncharge (electron-hole pairs) created in the semiconductor material by the interaction of X-rays. \n\nThe advantages of SDD compared to conventional energy dispersive detectors are lower \n\nelectronic noise and capacitance, shorter shaping times, considerably higher pulse \n\nthroughoutput and a pre-amplifying FET onto the detector chip. The energy-resolution is \n\nnowadays comparable to Si(Li) detectors and considerably high pulse throughput is achieved \n\nwithout detector cooling. The advantage of the Si(Li), nevertheless Si(Li) are still necessary \n\nbecause of their much higher detection efficiency \u2013 due to their thicker crystals \u2013 for high \n\nenergy photons (up to 50 keV). \n\nFor the present investigation all measurements were performed with the collimator \u2013 in \n\norder to access larger areal information of at once \u2013 except when the decorative motifs were \n\ntoo close to each other and only by means of polycapillary they are laterally resolved [36-38]. \n\nAs it was necessary to excite Sn- and Sb-K lines, the measuring conditions were always: 50 kV, 1 \n\nmA, 300 s and 10 mbar. Spectra were collected using a multichannel (4096 channels) and \n\nrecorded in ASCII data mode in order to perform their evaluation using the PyMCA software \n\ncode [51]. \n\nFor beam-size measurements, a knife-edge scan with a snap-off blade was performed for the \n\npolycapillary, while an iron wire was used to perform the scans for the collimator. The step-size \n\nwas 10 \u00b5m for the polycapillary and 0.5 mm for the collimator.  Figure 3.8 shows the scans \n\nperformed for beam emitted with a) a polycapillary and b) a collimator. For the energy of Fe-Ka \n\n(6.49 keV) the beam emitted with the polycapillary has a focal spot size of about 54 \u00b5m and the \n\ncollimator produces a beam of about 1.2 mm in diameter. One must keep in mind that the focal \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\nspot of polycapillary lenses are energy dependent (explained further on) \u2013 assessed by the Full \n\nWidth at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the profile obtained by such step-sized scans. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.8 \u2013 Scans performed for beam emitted with a) a polycapillary and b) a collimator. For the \n\nenergy of Fe-K? (6.49 keV) the beam emitted with the polycapillary has a focal spot size of about 54 \u00b5m \n\nand the collimator produces a beam of about 1.2 mm in diameter, both given by the Full Width at Half \n\nMaximum (FWHM) of the Gaussian fitted curves. \n\n \n\nX-ray polycapillary optics \n\nThe field of X-ray optics has grown tremendously in the past decades [52]. The necessity in \n\nanalyzing samples with a high lateral or spatial resolution became evident to help \n\nunderstanding their properties or phenomena. This was the motivation for developing optical \n\nsystems, which can focus or collimate an X-ray beam for the desired application.  Nowadays we \n\nhave at our disposal several optical systems, which provide different spot sizes for almost every \n\nrequirement. Further information on the properties of the most common X-ray optics as well as \n\ntheir applications can be found in the review articles from Snigirev et al. [53], MacDonald [54] \n\nand Guilherme et al. [55] \n\nPolycapillaries work under the principle of total reflection. It is meanwhile well-known that \n\nthe interaction of X-rays with matter can be macroscopically described by an index of \n\nrefraction. It can be derived from the interaction between a photon and a bound electron using \n\nthe forced oscillator model, where an elastically bound electron is forced to oscillate in the \n\nelectric field of the impinging photon. The whole derivation of the refraction index can be \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\nfound in James, 1962 [56]. An important result of this theory is that it leads to a complex index \n\nof refraction for X-rays, given by: \n\n     \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n   \n \n\n                                                     \n\nwith the wavelength of the photon ?, the scattering length   , the density of the matter ?, \n\nthe Avogadro constant   , the molar mass   and the atomic scattering factor: \n\n                    \n \n   \n\n      \n   \n\n                                  \n\nwhere      is the scattering vector between incident and scattered beam. Since only scattering \n\nin the forward direction is beneficial \u2013 while the rest accounts for attenuation \u2013 the atomic \n\nscattering factor (using the Z of the scattering element), can be re-written as: \n\n       \n   \n\n      \n   \n\n                                                 \n\nHence, equation (3.10): \n\nWith    \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n   \n\n \n      \n\n   \n       and        \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n\n   \n\n \n   \n\n \n                        \n\ncan be rearranged in the following way:                                   \n\n \n\nThe value of the decrement ? is in the order of 10\n-5\n\n to 10\n-7\n\n describes the refractive properties \n\nand depends on the energy of the X-rays (?\n2\n/2?), the number of relevant electrons per atom \n\n      \n   \n\n  and the density of atoms  \n   \n\n \n. If    \n\n   \n\n \n , and ? is given in         , an \n\napproximation can be found as:            \n \n\n \n                                     \n\nThe imaginary part, ?, describes the absorption of radiation in a medium and can be related \n\nto the linear attenuation coefficient \u00b5 as: \n\n   \n   \n\n \n                                                       \n\nThe small difference of the refraction index from the unit implies low reflection and \n\nrefraction abilities of matter in the X-ray energy range. An important outcome from this \n\nderivation is that the real part of the refraction index is smaller than 1. This means that the \n\noptical density of any substance in the X-ray range is smaller than that of vacuum and the \n\nphenomenon of total external reflection can take place at grazing angles of incidence [43, 56]. \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\nConsidering the scheme in figure 3.9 that represents the law of refraction formulated by Snell, \n\nit can be written as follows: \n\n        \n\n       \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n                                                 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.9 \u2013 Representation of the law of refraction. \n\n \n\nIf ?2 = 90? and n1 = 1, this leads to:                          \n  \n \n\n \n             \n\nwith ?c being the critical angle for total reflection. If one compares equation 3.17 with \n\nequation 3.14 \u2013 and having in mind         \u2013 one obtains: \n\n         \n                \n\n  \n\n \n                                \n\nwith E in keV, ? in g/cm\n3\n and ?c in mrad. \n\n \n\nIn the present case, focusing polycapillary half-lenses were used. They consist of consists of \n\nthousands of bundles of hollow glass capillaries with different curvatures, as indicated in figure \n\n3.10a. \n\n\n\n40 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.10 \u2013 a) Representation of focusing polycapillary half-lenses [57]; b) total reflection condition \n\nfor X-ray photons [58] and c) Radiation capture for a bent capillary [58]. \n\n \n\nAs the angle of the X-ray beam incident on the glass surface decreases from relatively high \n\nangles, the refracted beam in the glass will approach the critical angle (?c) and the increased \n\nprobability of propagating along the channel by multiple reflections (figure 3.10b). Photons \n\nwith ? > ?c will not propagate and a shading effect happens (figure 3.10c). For a borosilicate \n\nglass, one has: \n\n          \n  \n\n       \n                                                   \n\nSince the critical angle and the energy of the photon are inversely proportional, the \n\ntransmission of a polycapillary has generally a maximum for medium-range energies and it \n\ndecreases for both low-range and high-range energies. At higher energies, the angle of \n\nacceptance becomes smaller and the total reflection condition is not fulfilled anymore, while at \n\nlower energies, the reflectivity decreases.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n41 \n \n\n3.1.3 3D Micro-XRF \n\nA new mode of performing XRF analyses in depth was presented in 2003 by Kanngiesser et \n\nal. [59], where the first experimental applications were performed. The method consists in \n\nhaving two polycapillary lenses aligned in a confocal geometric arrangement, so 3D depth \n\nresolved analyses are feasible (figure 3.11). The model for this geometry was proposed by \n\nMalzer et al. [60] in 2005. Radiation from an X-ray source is focused by a polycapillary full or \n\nhalf-lens onto a sample. The resulting characteristic fluorescence radiation is transported with a \n\nsecond polycapillary half-lens to an energy-dispersive detector. The overlap of the foci of the \n\ntwo optics forms a probing volume from which information is derived. Due to the finite size of \n\nthis probing volume information can be obtained three-dimensionally by moving the micro-\n\nvolume through the sample. Absorption of exciting and fluorescence radiation limits the \n\npossible information depth and the extension of the probing volume affects the shape of the \n\nprofiles [61].  \n\nBoth qualitative and quantitative analyses can be performed by means of 3D Micro-XRF. A \n\nreview article published recently by Mantouvalou et al. [62] gives an overview of the work on \n\n3D Micro-XRF. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.11 \u2013 3D Micro-XRF sketch; the overlap of the foci from the two polycapillary half-lenses \n\nensure three-dimensional resolution (sketch by I. Mantouvalou [61]). \n\n \n\n \n\nWhen working with polycapillary X-ray optics some new features have to be taken into \n\naccount. One of them is the energy-radiation dependence. The transmission and spot size of a \n\npolycapillary lens are functions of the radiation energy. The spot size decreases with increasing \n\n\n\n42 \n \n\ntransported energy, which means that the size of the probing volume also decreases with \n\nincreasing fluorescence energy (figure 3.12). The transmission of a polycapillary lens can be \n\ndescribed by an asymmetric peak function, thus limiting the range of detectable elements \n\nthrough its decrease to higher and lower energies. Additionally, the absorption of radiation \n\nthrough matter is energy dependent and increases with decreasing energy. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.12 \u2013 Depth profile simulation on a 200 ?m thick glass samples with 50 ppm of CaO, Fe2O3, \n\nPbO and SrO homogeneously distributed in the sample matrix.

Mantouvalou [62]). \n\n \n\n3.1.3.1 Experimental setup and methodology \n\n3D Micro-XRF measurements were carried out with a tabletop setup from the Institute for \n\nOptics and Atomic Physics at the Technical University of Berlin. This system is a commonly \n\ndevelopment with ifG (Institute for Scientific Instruments). The X-ray tube is from Rtw R\u00f6ntgen-\n\nTechnik (Neunhagen, Germany); the polycapillary optics are from IfG (Berlin, Germany); and the \n\ndetector is from Bruker nano (Berlin, Germany). \n\n\n\n43 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.13 \u2013 a) General view of the 3D Micro-XRF spectrometer; b) Spectrometer\u00b4s gauge head; c) \n\nview of the polycapillary half-lenses and sample holder (left-hand side) (pictures by C. Seim [63]). \n\n \n\nWith the aim of checking the stratigraphy of the samples in a non-destructive way, the \n\nchoice of depth resolved XRF at the micrometer regime was justified. Therefore, a \n\ncharacterization of the spectrometer used was performed. Here the concept of probing volume \n\nplays a central role when using the confocal XRF \u2013 as explained above. Hence features such as \n\nbeam resolution have to be known at front in order to properly evaluate information obtained \n\nfrom the scans performed on the samples. \n\nIn order to evaluate the probing volume size, depth scans on thin single-element foils were \n\ncarried out. As the thickness of each foil is 2 \u00b5m, self absorption effects can be neglected since \n\nthe probing volume will be larger than the foils thickness. Depth scans in steps of 5 \u00b5m were \n\nperformed and the sum of the most intense peak \u2013 characteristic of each foil \u2013 was collected \n\n\n\n44 \n \n\nand plotted. The measuring time at each position was 10 s. In figure 3.14a the data collected \n\nfrom the depth scans performed with the Cu-foil are plotted. A Gaussian fit applied to the data \n\nspread showed a FWHM of ~ 34.6 \u00b5m for Cu-Ka energy (8.05 keV). Figure 3.14b displays the \n\nFWHM for all analyzed elements (foils) with respect to the energy. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.14 \u2013 a) Determination of the FWHM for Cu-K? (8.05 keV): ~ 34.6 \u00b5m; b) dependence of the \n\nFWHM as function of the energy. An exponential decrease of the FWHM is observed with increasing \n\nenergy. \n\nThe leading feature of this system is the ability to perform depth-resolving analysis, as \n\ndescribed above. However, due to the high amount of lead in the samples, strong absorption \n\neffects took place. In figure 3.15 an example of a depth scan performed perpendicular to the \n\nsurface of a sample \u2013 with a stratigraphy (from top to bottom) of yellow-glaze-body \u2013 is shown.  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.15 \u2013 Depth profile from a faience sample from Coimbra. The Pb-L? and Sb-L? lines are \n\ncharacteristic from the glaze and yellow color, respectively. \n\n\n\n45 \n \n\nFrom figure 3.15 one sees that the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) for the Sb-L? line is \n\nlarger than the one for the Pb-L?, which is due to the difference between probing volume sizes \n\nfor different energies (cf. figure 3.14). At 10 keV, a probing volume size of ca. 27 \u00b5m is \n\nexpected, while at 3 keV a size of ca. 57 \u00b5m is obtained, for the used lenses. This leads to a \n\ndifference in about 30 \u00b5m, which means that the existing 21 \u00b5m difference between the Pb-L? \n\nand Sb-L? profiles gives no information about a possible layered system. This leads to an \n\ninformation depth of several tens of micrometers, only, which prevents further depth \n\nresolution. \n\nNevertheless, we took advantage of another feature of the confocal geometry, which is \n\nprobing site selection \u2013 on the cross-section (figure3.16). The probing volume created in the \n\nconfocal geometry allows selective analysis in a certain volume in the micrometer regime, \n\nwhich reduces the amount of detected scattered radiation considerably. Therefore, scans just \n\non the surface of the polished cross section of each sample were performed, in steps of 5 ?m \n\n(each during 60 s) through a length that varied according to the thickness of the relevant part of \n\nthe sample [37] . The operating conditions were the maximum for this system: 50 kV and 600 \n\n?A.  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.16 \u2013 Schematic representation showing how the 3D Micro-XRF cross-section scans were \n\nperformed.  \n\n \n\n3.1.4 High-resolution Micro-XRF \n\nHigh-resolution Micro-XRF scans were performed at the synchrotron. More precisely, at the \n\nBAMline at BESSY-II (Berliner Elektronen Speicherring f\u00fcr SYnchrotronstrahlung) in Berlin, \n\n\n\n46 \n \n\nGermany. The fact that a 1 \u00b5m X-ray beam size is achieved was appealing for performing lateral \n\ncross-section scans to trace key-elements along the different \u201clayers\u201d of the samples.  \n\nSynchrotron radiation (SR) together with Compound Refractive Lenses (CRL) allowed having \n\na 1 \u00b5m beam, which provides information about the diffusion of the pigments throughout the \n\nglaze and the glaze throughout the ceramic support. The following sub-sections summarize the \n\nproperties of SR and CRLs. \n\n \n\n3.1.4.1 Synchrotron Radiation \n\nSynchrotron radiation (SR) is produced whenever electrons travelling at relativistic velocity \n\n(    ) are accelerated for example by forcing them to deviate from a straight line of motion. \n\nSR possesses unique features such as: \n\n? High brilliance (photons/sec/mm\n2\n/mrad\n\n2\n in 0.1% bandwidth) \n\n? Highly collimated (divergence in the mrad range) \n\n? Polarization  \n\n? Time structure (pulse lengths down to 100 ps) \n\n? Broad spectral range (IR to hard X-ray region) \n\n? Small source size (size and divergence of the electron beam) \n\nDue to the high energy     of the electrons, in the range of GeV, and the corresponding high \n\nvelocity, close to  , the relativistic version of the total radiated power   of an accelerated \n\nelectron (calculated by Larmor) has to be used to calculate the emitted radiation: \n\n    \n    \n\n   \n                                         \n\nwith        \n  and the orbit radius      . Further insight about SR properties can be \n\nfound, for example, in Duke [64]. A 3\nrd \n\ngeneration synchrotron source consists basically of an \n\nelectron gun, a microtron, the synchrotron and the storage ring (figure 3.17). \n\n\n\n47 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.17 \u2013 Main components and dimensions of the Berliner Elektronen Speicherring f\u00fcr \n\nSYnchrotronstrahlung (BESSY-II) in Berlin, Germany [65].  \n\n \n\nElectrons emitted by an electron gun are first accelerated in a linear accelerator (Microtron) \n\nand then transmitted to a circular accelerator (booster synchrotron) where they are \n\naccelerated to reach an energy of 1.7 billion electron volts (1.7 GeV) \u2013 in the case of BESSY-II. \n\nThese high-energy electrons are then injected into a large storage ring where they circulate in a \n\nvacuum environment, at a constant energy, for many hours. Each time these electrons pass \n\nthrough a magnetic device, they emit X-rays (SR), which are directed along beamlines. \n\nSR radiation can be emitted either by a bending magnet (BM) \u2013 which makes the electron \n\nbeam to undergo in circular trajectory \u2013 or by an insertion device, which comprise rows of \n\nmagnets with alternating polarity, installed in straight sections of the electron path. Insertion \n\ndevices are: wigglers (W), undulators (U) or wavelength shifters (WLS).  \n\nEach device provides different radiation features, being one of them related with the cone of \n\ndivergence in which more or less brilliance is obtained (figure 3.18). Generally: BM: When \n\nstored electrons encounter a BM, they bent and emit SR in a continuous spectrum; W:  the \n\nelectron beam wiggles with a large deviation angle and, as a result, bright a spectral continuous \n\nlight with short wavelengths is obtained; U: The electron beam wiggles with a small deviation \n\nangle and, as a result, highly bright and quasi-monochromatic light is obtained by the \n\ninterference effect; WLS: The electron beam passes a three dipole magnet array with \n\n\n\n48 \n \n\nalternating magnetic field directions. The radiation is emitted at the central dipole of the \n\nwavelength shifter. The other two dipoles only compensate the deflection of the electron beam \n\nfrom its orbit, so that the electrons leave the device in the same direction as they entered. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.18 \u2013 a) comparison of brilliance vs photon energy obtained with different magnetic devices \n\nat the synchrotron and X-ray tubes (from Spring 8 [66]); b) Spectral Photon Flux of a 1.3T bending \n\nmagnet and a 7T wavelength shifter. In the upper right corner, a schematic view of the electron \n\ntrajectory in a WLS is shown (adapted by G. Buzanich [67]). \n\n \n\n3.1.4.2 Compound Refractive Lenses (CRL) \n\nCLRs belong to the group of refractive optics, in which the X-rays undergo refraction at the \n\nsurfaces between different materials, as shown in figure 3.19. Since one lens only provokes a \n\nsmall change in the direction of the X-ray, an array of such lenses (therefore Compound \n\nRefractive Lenses) is necessary to obtain acceptable focal distances [68].  \n\n\n\n49 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.19 \u2013 Example of a CRL and its working principle. \n\n \n\nFor thin lenses, the focal length   can be calculated as: \n\n   \n \n\n   \n                                      \n\nwith the radius of curvature   and the number of lenses elements  . When the lens length   \n\nis in the range of the focal length, the formula for thick lenses can be applied [68]: \n\n   \n \n\n   \n \n \n\n \n                                \n\nDue to their simple design and alignment, CRLs are one of the most popular X-ray focusing \n\ndevices. The important features are: i) focusing in the region of 100 nm; and ii) focusing of X-\n\nrays with energies in the range from 5-200 keV is possible. The energy bandwidth of this kind of \n\nlenses (ca. 100 eV) is very small, meaning that for every energy an own lens has to be \n\nmanufactured. The fact that the CRL\u00b4s require a monochromatic and also parallel beam makes \n\nthem suitable for synchrotron beamlines only. \n\nAs an example, the CRL plate designed for the BAMline is shown in figure 3.20.  \n\n\n\n50 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.20 \u2013 CRL @BAMline (from KIT: www.x-ray-lenses.de  pictures by G. Buzanich). \n\n \n\n3.1.4.3 Experimental setup and methodology \n\nThe schematic of the BAMline @BESSY-II is shown in figure 3.21. In figure 3.22 the layout of \n\nthe \u00b5-XRF experiment at the BAMline and a sketch of the sample composition (wall-tile) in \n\nterms of its layers is shown to illustrate how the scans were performed. For these \n\nmeasurements two lenses were used: one with a nominal energy of 33.2 keV and another with \n\na nominal energy of 20.0 keV. This choice was taken due to the elemental variability present in \n\nthe decorative motifs as well as in the glaze. For the pieces which have yellow (Sb: Ec(K) = 30.491 \n\nkeV) the 33.2 keV lens was ideal and for the pieces which have blue (Co: Ec(K) = 7.709 keV), \n\ngreen (Cu: Ec(K) = 8.979 keV) and purple (Mn: Ec(K) = 6.539 keV; Fe: Ec(K) = 7.112 keV) colors \n\ntogether with the glaze (Pb: Ec(L3) = 13.035 keV) the 20 keV lens was used. Although the lens \n\nwith a nominal energy of 33.2 keV would have been able to excite the medium-low range, the \n\n20 keV lens was used for the measurements. This lens, due to its bigger aperture, provides \n\nmore flux at the sample and the absorption efficiency is higher for this elemental range.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.21 \u2013 Scheme of the BAMline.

The optical elements are a Double Multilayer Monochromator, a Double Crystal \n\nMonochromator and the CRL (sketch by G. Buzanich [39, 67]). \n\nhttp://www.x-ray-lenses.de/\n\n\n51 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.22 \u2013 (a) Layout of the \u00b5-XRF experiment at the BAMline; (b) a sketch of the sample \n\ncomposition (wall-tile) in terms of its layers. The scans were performed up to a maximum of 500 \u00b5m \n\nthickness of ceramic body [39]. \n\n \n\n3.2 X-ray Diffraction (XRD) \n\n \n\n3.2.1 XRD principles \n\nWhen a monochromatic incident X-ray beam interacts with a material in which a regular and \n\nperiodic arrangement of atoms (or molecules) exists \u2013 crystalline structure \u2013 diffraction of the \n\nbeam takes place in definite directions. This phenomenon can be seen as reflection of the \n\nincident beam by interior planes of a crystal (Bragg reflection) and it follows the Bragg \n\nequation, in fist approximation [42]: \n\n                               \n\n\n\n52 \n \n\nwhere n is the order of reflection, d is the interplanar spacing and ?n/2 is the angle of \n\nreflection (Bragg\u00b4s angle), which is defined by the angle between the reflecting plane of the \n\ncrystal and incident or reflected beam (figure 3.23). The first order of reflection is the strongest \n\nand the reflected intensity decreases as n increases.  \n\nAs previously described one of the types of interaction between X-rays and matter is elastic \n\nscattering of the X-rays (Rayleigh scattering). Diffraction is one example of elastic scattering \u2013 \n\nthe wavelength ? of the diffracted X-ray beam is conserved. A detailed theoretical development \n\nof the scattering occurring in a group of atoms can be found elsewhere [69]. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.23 \u2013 Visualization of the Bragg equation. Maximum scattered intensity is only observed \n\nwhen the phase shifts add to a multiple of the incident wavelength ? [69]. \n\n \n\nOne obtains, therefore, information about the minerals that constitute the sample. \n\nHowever, due, the sample preparation process as well as instrumental background it can hinder \n\nsome diffracted peaks \u2013 for example due to preferred crystallographic arrangement. \n\n \n\nThe ?/2? scan \n\nOne is interested in the measurement of Bragg reflections, i.e. their position, shape, \n\nintensity, in order to derive microstructural information from them. The intensity variation that \n\nis associated with the reflection is included in the interference function developed in [69], while \n\nthe scattered intensity depends on the distance from the sample to the detection system R. \n\nTherefore the instrument should be configured such that one can scan the space around the \n\n\n\n53 \n \n\nsample by keeping the sample\u2013detector distance R constant. This measure ensures that any \n\nintensity variation observed is due to the interference function and is not caused by a \n\ndependency on R. The detector should accordingly move on a sphere of constant radius R with \n\nthe sample in the center of it \u2013 performed by a goniometer. In addition, the sphere reduces to a \n\nhemisphere above the sample, since we are only interested in the surface layer and data \n\ncollection will be performed in reflection mode (figure 3.24). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.24 \u2013 Schematic representation of a ?/2? scan from the point of view of the sample \n\nreference frame [69]. \n\n \n\nThe sample is positioned in the center of the instrument and the probing X-ray beam is \n\ndirected to the sample surface at an angle ?. At the same angle the detector monitors the \n\nscattered radiation. The sample coordinate vectors S1 and S3 lie in the scattering plane defined \n\nby K0 and K. During the scan the angle of the incoming and exiting beam are continuously \n\nvaried, but they remain equal throughout the whole scan: ?in=?out. The ?/2? scan can also be \n\nunderstood as a variation of the exit angle when this is determined with respect to the \n\nextended incoming beam and this angle is 2? for all points in such a scan. The quantity \n\nmeasured throughout the scan is the intensity scattered into the detector. The results are \n\ntypically presented as a function of I(2?) type [69]. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n54 \n \n\n3.2.2 Experimental setup and methodology  \n\nXRD analyses were performed at the GeoBioTec from the University of Aveiro (Portugal). The \n\nequipment used was a Philips X'Pert PW 3040/60 goniometer, using Cu-K? radiation (? = 1.5405 \n\n\u00c5), 50 kV and 30 mA, automatic divergent notch graphite monochromator and a step size of \n\n1\u00b0/2?/min in the 4\u201365\u00b0 2? range, with data acquisition by Philips X\u2019Pert-Pro Data Collector v1.2.  \n\nThe sample preparation is the following: a small amount (6 \u2013 8 grams) of sample is removed \n\nand dried at around 40 ?C and then grinded, which id then passed through a sieve of 63 \u00b5m. \n\nThe obtained powder is mounted on a sample holder under a slight pressure \u2013 in order to \n\nminimize preferred crystallographic arrangement. This sample holder is then placed inside the \n\ndiffractometer. Identification of crystalline phases by XRD was carried out using the \n\nInternational Centre for Diffraction Data Powder Diffraction Files (ICDD PDF). \n\n  \n\n3.3 Scanning Electron Microscopy / Energy Dispersive X-ray System \n\n(SEM/EDX) \n\n \n\n3.3.1 SEM/EDX principles \n\nElectron beam-specimen interaction \n\nThis is a versatile technique, through which one obtains both morphological (SEM) and \n\ncompositional (EDX) information about the sample. The latter has developed into an own field \u2013 \n\nso to say \u2013 often referred as Electron Probe Micro-Analysis (EPMA). The primary reason for \n\nSEM\u00b4s usefulness is the high resolution that can be obtained when bulk objects are examined. \n\nThe principle of this method consists in bombarding target atoms (of a sample) with an \n\nelectron beam. In figure 3.25a a scheme of the electron-beam solid interactions as well as the \n\nrange and spatial resolutions for each one is shown (figure 3.25b). \n\n\n\n55 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.25 \u2013 (a) Electron beam solid interactions; (b) summary of range and spatial resolutions of \n\nelectrons and X-rays produced in SEM [71]. \n\n \n\nThe primary effects by impinging a high-voltage electron beam on the electrons of a target \n\nmaterial are elastic scattering \u2013 change of direction with negligible energy loss \u2013 and inelastic \n\nscattering \u2013 energy loss with negligible change in direction. Elastic scattering is mainly caused \n\nby interactions with the nucleus, through which significant deviations from the incident \n\ndirection occur. Inelastic scattering is caused by two mechanisms: (i) inelastic interaction with \n\nthe atomic nucleus and (ii) inelastic interaction with the bound electrons. Inelastic scattering is \n\nmainly responsible for producing signals than backscattered electrons. Inelastic interactions \n\nwith the nuclei of atoms are characterized by loss of energy in the Coulomb field of the nuclei \n\nand continuum X-radiation is emitted. Inelastic collisions between loosely bound outer \n\nelectrons of the target atoms provoke the ejection of these. Typically these ejected electrons \n\nwill have energy of about 50 eV and are called secondary electrons (SE). If these secondary \n\nelectrons are produced close to the surface and their energy is enough to overcome the surface \n\nbarrier (2-6 eV) they have high probability of escaping. However, these electron will be strongly \n\nabsorbed if they are produced much below the surface (? 100  ) and the probability of escape \n\nis lowered drastically [71]. One other result of inelastic collisions is the production of \n\ncharacteristic X-ray lines. The dissipation of energy from an impinging electron during inelastic \n\nscattering is quite complex to determine. From the quantum theory, Bethe obtained an \n\n\n\n56 \n \n\nexpression which described the stopping power of an electron (S) and can be simplified in the \n\nfollowing form: \n\n    \n \n\n \n\n   \n  \n\n                                                  \n\nand indicates the energy loss per unit mass thickness. ? is the physical density. S increases \n\nwith decreasing Z, being about 50% greater for Al than for Au at 20 keV. \n\nElastic scattering \u2013 by the nucleus \u2013 is by far the most probable large-angle scattering \n\nmechanism. The cross-section for inelastic scattering into angles greater than 10\n-2\n\n rad is much \n\nsmaller than for elastic scattering for all elements except for the ones of low-Z. Elastic \n\nscattering should be seen in two parts: (i) Rutherford scattering \u2013 which occurs in the Coulomb \n\nfield of the nucleus and is characterized by a large change in direction (even greater than 90?); \n\nand (ii) multiple scattering \u2013 composed of many small scattering events, in which in each of \n\nthese events the electron passes through the electron cloud of the atom and act as a screening \n\nfield for the nucleus. It may also results in large change of direction. In sum, beam electrons \n\nmay change directions in a series of events, travel back to the surface and escape \u2013 process of \n\nbackscattering (figure 3.25) [71]. Backscattered electrons (BSE) leave the sample with reduced \n\nenergy due to inelastic processes. From a certain depth in the target material, the original \n\ndirection of the electron beam is lost and the electrons diffuse through the material randomly. \n\nThe depth from which this happens can be seen as the depth of complete diffusion (xd \u2013 figure \n\n3.25b).  \n\nThe scattering cross-section at constant energy varies with Z\n2\n and the probability of \n\nscattering through a given angle varies as Z\n2\n/E\n\n2\n. The mean free path between scattering events \n\nat 30 keV decreases with increasing Z from 528   for Al to 131   for Cu and to 50   for Au \n\n(figure 3.26) [71].  \n\n\n\n57 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.26 \u2013 Electron trajectories calculated for Al, Cu and Au, E0 = 30 keV at normal (0?) and 45? \n\nincidence [71]. \n\n \n\nFor low-Z samples, most electrons penetrate deeply into the target before changing \n\ndirection by more than 90? and are absorbed in the sample. For high-Z samples the amount of \n\nscattering will increase and a state of complete diffusion will occur. In case of a heavy element, \n\nsuch as Au, diffusion happens much nearer the surface than for a light element, and most of the \n\nbackscattered electrons are caused by multiple rather than single scattering [71]. From figure \n\n\n\n58 \n \n\n3.26 it can be observed that, at the same energy, the electron appear to penetrate more deeply \n\ninto the low-Z element and the electron distribution seems to be more pear-shaped.  \n\nThere are two electron beam-solid interactions which lead to X-rays production: (i) core \n\nscattering \u2013 that results in the emission of continuous spectrum \u2013 and (ii) inner shell ionization \n\n\u2013 yielding characteristic lines. In (i) impinging electrons are inelastically scattered by the nucleus \n\nwhich results in a continuous spectrum of X-rays \u2013 similar to what happens in an X-ray tube, \n\nwhere Bremsstrahlung is produced. These X-rays assume a maximum energy value of incident \n\nelectron E0. The relationship between wavelength and energy of the X-ray photos is: \n\n             \n \n\n    \n            \n\n   \n\n       \n \n\n    \n\n       \n                          \n\n \n\nThe X-ray ranges can be summarized with the help of figure 3.27. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.27 \u2013 Comparison of X-ray production regions from specimen with densities of 3 g/cm\n3\n (Al) \n\n(left) and 10 g/cm\n3\n (Cu) (right) [71]. \n\n \n\nThe X-ray range for Al-K? in Al is much greater than that for Cu-K? in Cu. Moreover, the Cu-\n\nK? in Al comes from a depth closer to the surface in Al than it does the Al-K?. However, Cu-K? \n\nradiation in Al comes from much deeper in the sample than it does the Cu-K? in Cu. For light \n\nelements measured in high-Z matrices, the beam size is larger.  \n\nSummarizing, electron-beam interactions are responsible for the signals that can be used to \n\nreveal the topography and the local chemistry of the sample. \n\n \n\n\n\n59 \n \n\nImage formation \n\nThe quality and resolution of SEM images are function of three major parameters: (i) \n\nInstrument performance, (ii) selection of imaging parameters, and (iii) nature of the specimen. \n\nOne of the most surprising aspects of scanning electron microcopy is the apparent ease with \n\nwhich SEM images of three-dimensional objects can be interpreted by any observer with no \n\nprior knowledge of the instrument. The main components of a typical SEM are electron column, \n\nscanning system, detector(s), display, vacuum system and electronics controls (figure 3.28). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.28 \u2013 Main components of a typical SEM: electron column, scanning system, \n\ndetector(s), display, vacuum system and electronics controls [72].  \n\n \n\nThe electron gun generates free electrons and accelerates these electrons to energies in the \n\nrange 1-40 keV in the SEM. The purpose of the electron lenses is to create a small, focused \n\nelectron probe on the specimen. In order to produce images the electron beam is focused into \n\na fine probe, which is scanned across the surface of the specimen with the help of scanning \n\ncoils (figure 3.29). Each point on the specimen that is struck by the accelerated electrons emits \n\nsignal in the form of electromagnetic radiation. Selected portions of this radiation, usually \n\nsecondary (SE) and/or backscattered electrons (BSE), are collected by a detector and the \n\nresulting signal is amplified and displayed on a TV screen or computer monitor. The resulting \n\n\n\n60 \n \n\nimage is generally straightforward to interpret, at least for topographic imaging of objects at \n\nlow magnifications. The electron beam interacts with the specimen to a depth approximately 1 \n\n?m and complex interactions of the beam electrons with the atoms of the specimen produce \n\nwide variety of radiation \u2013 as previously explained.  \n\nUnlike optical or transmission electron microscopes no true image exists in the SEM. The \n\nparticularity of SEM is that the image is generated and displayed electronically, where no \n\noptical transformation takes place, and no real of virtual optical images are produced. \n\nThe primary signal carriers in SEM used to form images are secondary (SE) and backscattered \n\nelectrons (BSE). SE are low energy particles with typical energy of about 5 eV. BSE are high \n\nenergy particles with energies approaching the energy of the incident electron beam, e.g. \n\nseveral thousand eV. Compositional contrast or atomic number contrast arises because the \n\nintensity of the signal generated from areas with different composition is proportional to the \n\ndifference in the average atomic number of the respective areas. The most efficient way to \n\nimage compositional contrast is by using backscattered electrons because of the nearly \n\nmonotonic increase of the BSE coefficient ? with atomic number [71, 72]. Regions of high \n\naverage atomic number will appear bright relative to regions of low atomic number. The \n\nmagnitude of the atomic number contrast can be predicted. If a detector sensitive to the \n\nnumber of BSE is used, then the detected signal is proportional to the backscatter coefficient. \n\nThe contrast between two regions 1 and 2 can be calculated as the difference between the \n\nbackscatter coefficients (?1 and ?2): \n\n   \n     \n\n  \n                                         \n\nElements separated by one unit of atomic number produce low contrast; for example, Al and \n\nSi yield contrast of only 6.7%. For elements widely separated in atomic number, the contrast is \n\nmuch larger; for example, Al and Au produce contrast of 69%. Contrast above 10% is relatively \n\neasy to image in the SEM, contrast in the range 1 \u201310% requires careful strategy, and contrast \n\n<1% requires extreme measures to successfully image it. \n\nTopographic contrast includes all effects by which the shape and morphology of the \n\nspecimen can be imaged. Most of applications of the SEM involve studying shapes. Topographic \n\ncontrast is the most important imaging mechanism. Topographic contrast arises because the \n\n\n\n61 \n \n\nnumber and trajectories of BSE and the number of SE depend on the angle of incidence \n\nbetween the beam and the specimen\u2019s surface. The angle of incidence varies because of the \n\nlocal inclination of the specimen. At each point the beam strikes, the number of BSE and SE \n\ndetected gives direct information on the inclination of the specimen.  \n\n \n\nSample requirements \n\nSince the SEM is operated under high vacuum the specimens that can be studied must be \n\ncompatible with high vacuum (~ 10-5 mbar). This means that liquids and materials containing \n\nwater and other volatile components cannot be studied directly. Also fine powder samples \n\nneed to be fixed firmly to a specimen holder substrate so that they will not contaminate the \n\nSEM specimen chamber. Non-conductive materials need to be attached to a conductive \n\nspecimen holder and coated with a thin conductive film by sputtering or evaporation. Typical \n\ncoating materials are Au, Pt, Pd, their alloys, as well as carbon.  \n\n \n\n3.3.4 Experimental setup and methodology \n\nThe experiments have been carried out in two specialized institutions: \n\nA. At the GeoBioTec \u2013 University of Aveiro (Aveiro, Portugal); \n\nB. At BAM, Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing, Division 6.8 \n\nSurface Analysis and Interfacial Chemistry (Berlin, Germany). \n\nA \u2013 In this case, measurements were carried out with a Hitachi S4100 system, equipped with \n\nQuantax 400 EDS system of Bruker AXS (XFlash Silicon Drift Detector). A 15 kV acceleration \n\nvoltage and a current intensity of 32 \u00b5A were applied. The chemical information by EDS was \n\ntaken from an area of 300x400 \u00b5m\n2\n selected regarding its homogeneity and lack of voids, with \n\nspectrum acquisition times of minimum 60 s. The semi-quantitative results were based on a \n\npeak-to-background ZAF evaluation method (P/B-ZAF), being ZAF a matrix correction, mainly \n\nbased on analytical expressions for atomic number (Z), X-ray yield, self-absorption (A) and \n\nsecondary fluorescence enhancement (F), provided by the Esprit software. \n\nB \u2013 In this case measurements were performed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) \n\nZeiss Supra 40 with a Schottky field emitter having attached a silicon drift detector energy \n\n\n\n62 \n \n\ndispersive X-ray spectrometer (SDD-EDS) Quantax 400 from Bruker as well as a Si(Li)-EDS from \n\nThermo Fisher Scientific (see [73-75] for more details). Various beam voltages from 5 to 30 kV \n\nhave been applied. EDX spectra have been taken mostly in the \u201cpoint and shoot\u201d mode in order \n\nto pick up as much as possible information from representative structural features observed \n\nwith the SEM. \n\nBoth \u201ctop\u201d observations of the specimen surface and in the cross-section one through the \n\nthick coating(s) have been employed. Depending on the size of the structural features selected \n\nfor investigation various magnifications have been used, for the real magnification (periodically \n\ncalibrated) see the micrometer marker on each SEM micrograph. Note that some micrographs \n\nhave been taken in the conventional (high-resolution) mode of the SEM and some micrographs \n\nhaving associated selected areas for EDX \u201cpoint and shoot\u201d analyses have been taken over the \n\nEDS system in the low-resolution mode. This lies in the need of increasing the efficiency of \n\nanalysis for the rather high number of samples and investigated areas of interest. \n\n \n\n3.4 X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) \n\n \n\n3.4.1 XAFS principles \n\nXAFS settles under the physical principle of X-ray Absorption, which is a consequence of the \n\nphotoelectric effect. One obtains variations of the absorption coefficient of a certain element \n\nwhile the energy of the incident photons is tuned around the absorption edge of that element. \n\nXAFS can be divided in two parts, X-ray Absorption Near Edge (XANES) and Extended X-ray \n\nAbsorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) (figure 3.29).  \n\n \n\n\n\n63 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.29 \u2013 Scheme enhancing XANES and EXFAS regions of an absorption edge. \n\n \n\nXANES or NEXAFS is related to transitions from core levels to unoccupied levels of the \n\nprobed atom, which correspond to the edge fine structure. The interpretation of XANES is \n\nextremely complicated as there is no simple physical description for it. However, the features of \n\nabsorption at this region are governed by the density of final states (DOS). Hence, \n\nmeasurements at the XANES region allow the determination of the oxidation state and local \n\ncoordination number (related to the crystal structure) of the analyzed element.  \n\nEXAFS is related to the interference between the outgoing wave (transition from core level \n\nto the continuum) and the incoming wave (backscattered from neighboring atoms) (figure \n\n3.30). The variations in the absorption coefficient, \u00b5(E), emerge from the interference between \n\nthese waves in a probabilistic way and because of this it can only be described quantum-\n\nmechanically. As the absorption process represents the transition between two quantum \n\nstates, one can describe \u00b5(E) with Fermi\u2019s Golden Rule: \n\n                                                                             \n\n with      and      being the initial and final states, respectively and   is the operator that \n\ndescribes the process of changing between two energy and momentum states. By the presence \n\nof a neighboring atom, the photoelectron can be scattered by the electrons of the neighboring \n\natom and return to the absorbing atom, hence the final state will carry this contribution as well \n\n[76]. Based on the considerations for the quantum wave theory, the equation for EXAFS can be \n\nwritten as: \n\n\n\n64 \n \n\n      \n   \n\n      \n \n\n      ?          \n\n   \n \n\n               \n\n \n\n             \n\nAs in real samples more than one neighbor atom is found, equation (3.29) comprises the \n\nsum of the contribution of each scattering atom type (also denominated coordination shell). \n\nHence, j corresponds to the individual coordination shells at approximate distance from the \n\nprobed atom; N is the coordination number; ?\n2\n is the mean square displacement within the \n\ninter-atomic distance (R); ? is the mean free path of the photo-electron and k the wave-\n\nnumber. \n\nSome remarks about equation (3.29) are for example: from the terms ?(k) and R\n-2\n\n the \n\ninformation obtained is local, in the range of 5 Angstroms away from the absorber atom [76]; \n\nthe amplitude of the EXAFS signal is proportional to the coordination number; the ?\n2\n dampens \n\nexponentially and the sine factor implies that longer inter-atomic distances result in higher \n\nfrequency oscillations; this equation breaks down at low-k, which makes it complicated to \n\ninterpret XANES.  In sum, measurements at the EXAFS region provide information about the \n\nlocal surrounding environment (neighbors) of the probed atom. \n\nExamples for further insight on the XAFS theory and properties are given by Rehr et al. [77] \n\nand by Yano et al. [78].  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.30 \u2013 Scheme for single scattering (in blue) and multiple scattering (in red) in the \n\nEXAFS region [79]. \n\n\n\n65 \n \n\n \n\n3.4.2 Data handling \n\nOnce the spectra are recorded, column ASCII raw data files have to be stored in order to be \n\nprocessed by proper developed software that handle XAFS data. All data were prior normalized \n\nto the Ionization Chamber (IC), so that variations in the primary beam intensity are taken into \n\naccount. For processing the experimental XAFS data ATHENA (v. 0.8.056) was used [80]. This \n\nGUI program belongs to the main package IFEFFIT (v. 1.2.11) [80].  \n\nThe first step for treating a XAFS spectrum is to perform background subtraction by \n\nnormalization to the edge step, which was carried out automatically using ATHENA.  This \n\ncomprises the pre-edge normalization range (at the very beginning) and post-edge \n\nnormalization region (at the far energy region). After normalization the pre-edge and post-edge \n\nregions become parallel and the automatic background subtraction takes into account the \n\nregions previously defined.  \n\nFor the XANES measurements, the use of materials with known crystal structures is most of \n\nthe time the best approach to infer about the unknown samples. XANES scans were performed \n\non the original samples as well as on reference materials (known valence and coordination) and \n\nprepared replicas. Using the ATHENA program a linear combination fitting routine was \n\nperformed taking all reference spectra into account in order to compare with the \u2018unknown\u2019 \n\nspectra. A weight of the contribution that each reference has on the \u2018unknown\u2019 spectrum gives, \n\ntherefore, a hint of the possible valences and coordinations.  \n\nRegarding the EXFAS region, measurements were performed on original samples, reference \n\nmaterials and replicas. With ATHENA one can plot  (k) against R(\u00c5) and the oscillations \n\nrepresent different frequencies, which correspond to the different distances for each \n\ncoordination shell. Hence, Fourier transforms (FT) are necessary for the analysis process. The FT \n\nfrom the k-space to R-space was performed with a Hanning-type window with a range of 2 \u00c5 to \n\n14 \u00c5. However, if one keeps just comparing the oscillations between spectra, the reliable \n\nknowledge obtained is limited, since accurate results are given for the first two or three \n\nneighbor shells only. Software codes such as FEFF [81] provide accurate scattering factors which \n\n\n\n66 \n \n\nare taken into account for multiple scattering phenomena and assist the conclusions about the \n\nneighboring environment of the probed atom.  \n\n \n\n3.4.3 Experimental setup and methodology \n\nXAFS measurements at the Sb-K edge and at the Pb-L3 edge were performed, and for this \n\ncase two beamlines with different experimental specifications were used: \u00b5Spot beamline and \n\nBAMline. Even if both beamlines \u2013 at the BESSY-II storage ring (Berlin, Germany) \u2013 use the same \n\n7 T wavelength shifter as insertion device, they have very different qualities. The advantage of \n\nthe \u00b5Spot beamline is the higher photon flux \u2013 due to a focusing mirror \u2013 in the energy region \n\nfrom 1 keV to about 25 keV (>10\n11\n\n ph/s), while at the BAMline the flux in this energy range is \n\nabout two orders of magnitude lower. Above 25 keV the photon flux of the \u00b5Spot drops rapidly \n\nunder 10\n8\n ph/s, while at the BAMline this mark is only reached at about 75 keV.  Furthermore, \n\n\u00b5Spot beamline allows a depth resolved speciation of a certain chemical state of a given \n\nelement (by means of 3D Micro-XAFS), with a reliable reconstruction procedure recently \n\ndeveloped by L\u00fchl et al. [82]. This beamline uses a seven-element Si(Li) detector (from e2v, \n\nSirius model, UK) with and active area of 30 mm\n2\n each, and a polycapillary half-lens was placed \n\nin front of one of them. At the excitation channel, a polycapillary half-lens was also used, having \n\na FWHM 18 ?m for Cu-K? (?9 keV). Furthermore, the transmission function of this les has a \n\nmaximum at around 15 keV. \n\nBoth beamlines use a double crystal monochromator (DCM) with Si (311) crystals at the \n\n\u00b5Spot (energy resolution E/?E ? 25000) and Si (111) crystals at the BAMline (E/?E ? 5000).  \n\nFurther detailed descriptions of the \u00b5Spot beamline can be found in [83] and further technical \n\ndata for the BAMline can be found in [84]. Furthermore, the radiation detection at the BAMline \n\nwas carried out by means of a Si(Li) detector from e2v as well but this one is a single-element \n\ndetector with an active area of 30 mm\n2\n. \n\nBoth conventional and confocal measurements were performed in order to evaluate the \n\nusefulness of the latter geometry for the samples hereby described. It was proven that given \n\nthe thickness and high-Z matrix of the samples, no significant alteration of the signal was \n\nobtained by measuring in conventional mode. At the \u00b5Spot conventional Pb-L3 XANES \n\n\n\n67 \n \n\nmeasurements were performed on both yellow and glaze surfaces, while at the BAMline both \n\nconventional Pb-L3 EXAFS and Sb-K XANES and Sb-K EXAFS measurements were performed.  \n\nAll measurements were performed in fluorescence mode, as the samples are thick and \n\ncontain high Z matrix. Furthermore, thin sections could not have been obtained because one is \n\ndealing with Cultural Heritage (CH) related objects and a non-destructive approximation is a \n\nrequisite for this investigation. \n\nThe experimental setup at the BAMline is the same as shown before (cf. figure 3.22), except \n\nthat instead of the CRL lenses, a slit with an aperture of 3x1 mm, was used. The experimental \n\nsetup at the \u00b5Spot is depicted in figure 3.31. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.31 \u2013 Optical layout of the MySpot beamline. Energy range of 4.5 keV\u201330 keV.

Mantouvalou [61] ; right-hand side: \n\nsetup at the BAMline for XAFS measurements (picture by A. Guilherme). \n\n \n\n3.5 Statistical data handling \n\nWhen performing scientific studies, the sough for patterns among the analytical data \n\nbecomes necessary to assist the conclusions. For this purpose, statistical data handling is \n\nessential. The only remaining question is what kind of treatment is suitable for the present \n\nstudy.  \n\nStatistical studies can be separated into two big groups: parametric and nonparametric \n\nmethods. Parametric studies follow well-known distributions, such as the Gaussian distribution \n\nwhere individual data are specified by assigning constant values to two parameters (normally \n\nthese are the mean - \u00b5 - and the variance - ?\n2\n). However, to perform a parametric inference on \n\nany population of data is most of the times unreasonable, even if one has precise \n\nmeasurements, as one is implying a certain normality within the data (mean, median and \n\nmode) that may not exist [85].  \n\nBased on the aims of this investigation, finding correlations can be quite useful to determine \n\nrelationships between the data and aid the conclusions. Correlation is a measure of the \n\nrelationship between two variables. This can be performed using the Pearson correlation \n\ncoefficient, denoted by ? (rho), which \u2013 in the parametric context \u2013 estimates the degree of \n\nlinearity between two variables. This coefficient can assume values between -1 and +1. When ? \n\n= -1, there is a negative correlation between the variables (they are inversely proportional), \n\n\n\n69 \n \n\nwhen ? = +1 there is a positive correlation (they are directly proportional), and when ?? = 0 \n\nthere is no linear correlation (they are either independent or there is a non-linear relationship \n\nbetween them) [85]. In figure 3.33 a representation of the different correlation values of ? is \n\ngiven. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.33 \u2013 Examples of different Pearson correlation coefficient values (?) [86].  \n\n \n\nHowever, the limitation of this method is being sensitive to linear dependence only. Other \n\nmore robust correlation coefficients have been developed, which are sensitive to nonlinear \n\nrelationships as well, such as the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. This coefficient \n\ndenoted by rs, is a nonparametric measure of the statistical dependence between two \n\nvariables, inferring on how well the relationship between these variables can be described \n\nusing an order function (monotonicity) [85]. The Spearman\u2019s coefficient can be calculated by \n\nequation 3.25: \n\n     \n          \n\n   \n\n       \n (3.30), \n\nwhere          \n    represents the sum of the squares of the difference between the ranks \n\nof each sample pair and n is the number of individuals for the sample. Here the raw data \n\nvariables         are replaced by their ranks        . If the x and y ranks are all equal for each \n\nindividual one obtains         , then the sum term becomes zero and       For the opposite \n\nsituation one obtains        If there is no correlation between ranks,      [85]. Figure 3.34 \n\n\n\n70 \n \n\nshows some examples of possible correlations obtained with the Spearman correlation \n\ncoefficient [87]. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.34 \u2013 Examples of different Spearman correlation coefficient values (rs): a) rs = 1 when two \n\nvariables are monotonically related, even when their relationship is not exactly linear (proven by the \n\nPearson coefficient (?) as well); b) there is not an obvious relationship between the variables and the \n\ncoefficients assume values close to zero (also from ?); c) there seems to exist a linear correlation \n\nbetween the variables but rs is not so sensitive to outliers than the ?; d) in this case a negative rs \n\ncorresponds to a decreasing monotonic tendency between the two variables [87]. \n\n \n\nWhen using such methods one should determine its significance \u2013 that is, how stable the \n\nrelationship found between the data is. This is provided by the p-value \u2013 the probability of error \n\nthat is involved in accepting the observed result as valid. This directs to a statistical hypothesis \n\ntest that consists in two hypotheses:  the null hypothesis (H0), which is going to be tested and \n\nthe alternative hypothesis (H1) that corresponds to the sample observations. For the present \n\ncase, the used test was the so-called two-tailed test, which means that H0 is equal a certain \n\nvalue and H1 assumes any other value different from H0 [85]. In the presented studies, using the \n\n\n\n71 \n \n\nSpearman correlation method, H0 \u2013 represents no correlation and H1 \u2013 represents a correlation. \n\nH0 will be rejected if p ? 0.05 and for these cases a correlation between variables is found. \n\nAnother important tool for the present investigation is cluster analysis (CA). CA provides \n\nmeaningful taxonomies, groups or clusters of data based on combinations of instrumental \n\nvariables (IV), which maximizes the similarity of cases within each cluster while maximizing the \n\ndissimilarity between groups that are initially unknown [88]. As the number of groups or \n\nclusters that will emerge is unknown, this technique follows two stages: \n\n1) Carry out a hierarchical cluster analysis using the Ward\u00b4s method applying \n\nsquared Euclidean Distance as the distance or similarity measure; \n\n2) Rerun the hierarchical cluster analysis with a selected number of clusters, which \n\nenables to allocate every case in ones sample to a particular cluster. \n\nEuclidean distance is an ordinary distance between two points that can be measured with a \n\nruler, which is the simpler way of computing distances between objects in a multi-dimensional \n\nspace, as they represent an extension of the Pythagoras\u2019 theorem. Moreover, the squared \n\nEuclidean distance is used more often than the simple Euclidean distance in order to place \n\nprogressively greater weight on objects that are further apart [88]. \n\nThe next important topic is to choose the clustering algorithm, i.e. the rules that govern \n\nbetween which points distances are measured to determine cluster membership. Among all the \n\npossible clustering methods, the Ward\u00b4s method will be used. This method uses an analysis of \n\nvariance\n5\n approach to evaluate the distances between clusters. Cluster membership is \n\nevaluated by calculating the total sum of squared deviations from the mean of a cluster. The \n\ncluster criterion should produce the smallest possible increase in the error sum of squares. \n\nA dendrogram is a graphical representation of hierarchical cluster analyses. It is a branching \n\ndiagram that represents the relationships of similarity among a group of entities. Figure 3.35 \n\nshows an example a dendrogram in horizontal display. \n\n                                                           \n5\n A measure of how far the set of numbers is spread out. \n\n\n\n72 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.35 \u2013 Example of a dendrogram. The blue circles represent the branches (or clades) and the \n\ndark red filed circles mark the so called leafs.  \n\n \n\nThe height of the vertical lines indicates the degree of difference between branches \u2013 the \n\nlonger the line, the larger the difference. For example, cases 3 and 4 are more similar to each \n\nother than cases 1 and 2 because the height of the vertical lines of the former is smaller than \n\nthe latter. One can find clusters at any height of the dendrogram, as at each clade a new cluster \n\nappears. It is just a matter of choosing a distance between clusters. \n\nThe software used for the statistical data handling was SPSS (Statistical Package for Social \n\nSciences), version 20.0. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n73 \n \n\nCHAPTER 4 \u2013 RESULTS \n\n \n\n4.1 \u2013 Suitability of XRF for glazed ceramics analyses \n\nDue to high heterogeneity among glazed ceramic objects, one must primarily distinguish the \n\nscale at which differences in the composition occur especially if the chosen techniques are \n\nproviding reliable information at that scale. This is intrinsically related to the resolution and the \n\nsensitivity of the technique and in order to evaluate this and other crucial technical features, \n\nthe suitability of the XRF setup for the present case study was evaluated.  The following topics \n\nwere considered: \n\ni) Analysis of standard reference materials with two emission modes: polycapillary lens \n\nand collimator; \n\nii) Performance tests: linearity through calibration curves; \n\niii) Estimation of the mass attenuation coefficient of the specimen based on the Compton \n\npeak intensity. \n\nTwo groups of standard reference materials are presented:  the silicates group to infer on \n\nthe ceramic body and the glasses group to infer on the glaze.  \n\nThe silicates group was provided by I. Queralt from the Spanish National Research Council \n\n(CSIC) in Barcelona, Spain.  All of them are Geochemical Certified Reference Materials (CRM\u2019s), \n\nwith data reported in the Govindaraju\u2019s compilation [89]: Basalt (BE-N), Diorite (DR-N), Granite \n\n(GS-N), Anorthosite (AN-G), Granite (MA-N), Granite (AC-E), Dolerite (WS-E), Microgabbro (PM-\n\nS); Potash Feldspar (BCS-376), Firebrick (BCS-315) and Sillimanite (BCS-309). The glasses group \n\nbelongs to CFAUL and the CRM\u00b4s are: SRM-612 (from NIST \u2013 National Institute of Standards and \n\nTechnology), Fluoride Opal Glass SGT-4, Soda-Lime-Magnesia-Silica Glass SGT-5, Soda-Lime-\n\nSilica Glass SGT-7, Lead-Oxide-Potassium Oxide-Silica Glass SGT-8 (Standard Glass Technology). \n\nThe silicates group represents prepared pressed powder pellets with a nominal mass of 5 g. \n\nIn the glasses group only the SRM-612 is a pressed pellet. SGT-4 was supplied as white pieces; \n\nSGT-5, SGT-7 and SGT-8 as colorless glass pieces. \n\n \n\n\n\n74 \n \n\nSome characteristics and distinctive features of different ceramics can be found among \n\nrelationships between chemical elements playing similar roles in the structure (network \n\nformers, modifiers, nucleating agents, etc.) in ceramic production process. Hence, the linearity \n\nbetween several elemental ratios was checked and is displayed in figure 4.1. The x-axis \n\nrepresents the net peak area ratios between neighbor elements and the y-axis represents oxide \n\ncomposition found in the sheets from the certifying company. Through this relationship one is \n\nable to retrieve directly the ratio between the respective oxides (usual form in ceramic \n\nchemical assemblages). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 \u2013 Linearity response with net peak area ratios of neighboring elements and respective \n\ntabled oxide composition for all the silicate standard reference materials. \n\n \n\nSince Compton scattering increases with decreasing average atomic number (cf. chapter 3, \n\nsub-section 3.1.2), a way of estimating the matrix effects is to evaluate the Compton scatter \n\npeak from the characteristic X-ray lines of the tube anode material (cf. chapter 3, section 3.2).   \n\n\n\n75 \n \n\nSince the intensity of the Compton peak (Is) is inversely proportional to the mass attenuation \n\ncoefficient (\u00b5s) of the specimen, \n\n   ?     \n \n\n   ?  \n                        (4.1) \n\n it can be used to estimate the absorption coefficient of the sample at the wavelength (or \n\nenergy) of the scattered photons [90]. \n\nThe analyzed spectra of the silicates and glass standards were fitted and the Compton net \n\npeak areas were used to estimate the mass attenuation coefficient (\u00b5s) in the specimen, using \n\n(4.1). Figure 4.2 shows the order of magnitude for the \u00b5s in each standard. In figure 4.2a one \n\nsees that the values for \u00b5s are of the same order of magnitude for the different standards, \n\nwhich means that the matrix average atomic number (Z) does not vary significantly among the \n\ndifferent silicates. Conversely, in figure 4.2b a difference of two orders of magnitude for the \u00b5s \n\nbetween the glass standard SGT-8 and the rest is observed. This can be explained by the high \n\nlead oxide (PbO) content present in the SGT-8 standard (about 31%), while in the other glass \n\nstandards PbO is a minor or trace compound.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2 \u2013 Mass attenuation coefficient (\u00b5s) estimation by calculating the inverse of the Compton \n\nscatter intensity (Is) at the wavelength of Mo-K?, for a) silicates standards and b) glass standards. \n\n \n\nSince \u00b5s and Is are inversely proportional, it becomes clear that the higher the average \n\natomic number (Z) of the sample the lower the Compton peak and the stronger the mass \n\nattenuation coefficient. \n\n\n\n76 \n \n\nOne of the most important aspects is the fact that the features hereby presented are at a \n\nqualitative level and can provide significant information about the samples by comparing \n\nelemental ratios. Quantification was not performed in this investigation, due to compositional \n\nheterogeneities and irregularities in the thickness of layers.  \n\n \n\n4.2 \u2013 Original samples: fragments \n\nThe structure of this section is based on the comparison between the two ceramic \n\nproduction centers to enhance differences and/or similarities between the technological \n\naspects of these objects. This study corresponds to analyses performed on fragments from \n\nfaiences from Coimbra and wall-tiles both from Coimbra and Lisbon (cf. Annex 1.3). A shorter \n\nversion of this study for whole museum objects is presented further in section 4.4 \u2013 In situ \n\nanalysis of whole Museum objects. \n\nAs previously described (cf. chapter 1, section 1.2) these objects are composed by three \n\nmain zones: body, glaze and surface decoration. Hence, a subsection focused on each part of \n\nthe samples is created in order to compare their features.  \n\n \n\n4.2.1 \u2013 Ceramic body  \n\n \n\nX-ray Fluorescence (XRF) \n\nConventional XRF measurements were performed in the ceramic body of all available pieces. \n\nIn figure 4.3 an example of the elemental variability found in the ceramic support is shown.  \n\n\n\n77 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3 \u2013 XRF spectrum of the ceramic body of faience from Coimbra, obtained in conventional \n\nmode.  \n\n \n\nFrom the spectrum depicted in figure 4.3 one sees that apart from the expected (main) \n\npresence of Al and Si, the major elements are K, Ca and Fe. These are a hint for the (expected, \n\nas well) presence of feldspars, more precisely potash-feldspar (microcline or orthoclase) and \n\ncalcium plagioclase (Anorthite). Another important element, which comes normally in \n\nassociation to feldspars, is sodium (Na). This, however, could not be detected by the used \n\nspectrometer, as its quantity lies below the detection limit.  \n\nAnother important aspect to discuss about is the thickness of the samples. The fragments \n\nfrom faience samples are all thin (max. 2 mm thick body). XRF analyses on the ceramic body \n\nwere performed on the back side (non-glazed). As previously described (cf. chapter 1, sub-\n\nsection 1.2.1) the elemental variability within the ceramic support is strongly dependent on the \n\ngeological resources of the region as well as the manufacturing techniques employed. For this \n\nreason, a comparison of the most significant elements within the ceramic body composition \n\nbetween the different samples (faiences from Coimbra, wall-tiles from Coimbra and from \n\nLisbon) was carried out (figure 4.4).  \n\n \n\n\n\n78 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4 \u2013 Comparison of most significant elements that constitute the ceramic body (Al, Si, K, Ca, \n\nTi, Fe, Rb, Sr) between faiences from Coimbra (Coimbra F), wall-tiles from Coimbra (Coimbra T) and wall-\n\ntiles from Lisbon (Lisbon T). \n\n \n\nFrom figure 4.4 one extracts that a difference between some elements, such as Ca and Fe, \n\nexists. Faiences from Coimbra (Coimbra F) show higher Fe count rate than Ca, which does not \n\nhappen for the wall-tiles from Coimbra (Coimbra T) and Lisbon (Lisbon T). Moreover, there is a \n\none order of magnitude difference for the Fe count rate between wall-tiles and faiences. In \n\ngeneral, the elemental variability is much more constant for the faience samples, than for the \n\nwall-tile samples, which is intrinsic to the manufacturing process (cf. chapter 5). \n\n \n\nX-ray Diffraction (XRD) \n\nAs complementary information to the so far presented results, XRD measurements were also \n\nperformed on the ceramic support of some of the samples (figure 4.5). At this point it is \n\nimportant to highlight that this is a destructive procedure and, therefore, just some pieces were \n\nable to be analyzed. To these results, specifically the ones from faiences from Coimbra, the \n\nwork developed by M. J. Fonseca [91] was taken into account. \n\n\n\n79 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.5 \u2013 Diffractograms of the ceramic bodies of 4 faiences from Coimbra (blues), 3 wall-tiles \n\nfrom Coimbra (greens) and 3 wall-tiles form Lisbon (red-oranges). The crystalline phases are marked on \n\nthe top, assigned with initials: G \u2013 Gehlenite; Gy \u2013 Gypsum; Q \u2013 Quartz; M \u2013 Microcline; C \u2013 Cristobalite; \n\nCa \u2013 Calcite; A \u2013 Anorthite; Go \u2013 Goethite; W \u2013 Wollastonite.  \n\n \n\nIn general, quartz (SiO2) and alkali feldspars (Microcline (M): KAlSi3O8  - K-rich) are the \n\ncrystalline phases identified among all samples, as well as Gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O, denoted as Gy) \n\nbut with a much lower significance. Other feldspars that are Ca-rich, such as Anorthite: \n\nCaAl2Si2O8 (denoted as A) are identified with higher significance among the samples from \n\nCoimbra \u2013 faiences and wall-tiles \u2013 with more intense diffraction peaks for faiences. Calcite \n\n(CaCO3, denoted as Ca) and Gehlenite (Ca2Al(AlSiO7), denoted as G) are identified with higher \n\nsignificance among the wall-tiles from Lisbon. In addition, Wollastonite (CaSiO3, denoted as W) \n\nand Goethite (FeO(OH), denoted as Go) are identified only in the wall-tiles from Lisbon. At last, \n\nCristobalite (denoted as C) \u2013 which is a high-temperature polymorph of silica (same chemical \n\n\n\n80 \n \n\nformula but different crystal structure) \u2013 is pronounced among the samples from Coimbra \n\n(faiences and wall-tiles) only, at around 2? = 22?. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.6 \u2013 a) Phase equilibrium diagram of CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 [92]. Cristobalite (in yellow), Anorthite \n\n(in blue) and Gehlenite (in green) are some of the crystalline phases identified by the diffractograms; b) \n\nPhase-diagram of SiO2 [93]. \n\n \n\nRegarding Cristobalite, its presence in XRD diagrams is a strong hint of the cooling process \n\noccurred. As the firing temperature increases, silica undergoes the so-called \u201cquartz inversion\u201d \n\n\u2013 from quartz-? to quartz-? - and when the pressure increases, polymorph phases such as \n\nTridymite and Cristobalite are formed (figure 4.6b). If the cooling process is made rapidly \n\nenough, typical high-temperature phases keep in the structure along with some thermal \n\ntensions, which leads to a more fragile object.  \n\n \n\n4.2.2 \u2013 Glaze  \n\n \n\nX-ray Fluorescence (XRF) \n\nConventional XRF measurements were performed on the glazed surfaces (white areas) of all \n\nsamples in order to compare the elemental content. In this case, the incident beam was \n\n\n\n81 \n \n\nconducted through the collimator and the analyzed areas of about 1.2 mm\n2\n give reliable \n\ninformation of the whole glazed white parts of the samples, due to their intrinsic heterogeneity. \n\nYet, three measurements on each sample in different spots were carried out and averaged for \n\neach sample. Figure 4.7 is an example of the elemental diversity found in such glazes, and in \n\nthis case it corresponds to a faience and a wall-tile from Coimbra as well as a wall-tile from \n\nLisbon.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.7 \u2013 XRF spectra of the glaze of a faience and a wall-tile from Coimbra and wall-tile from \n\nLisbon, obtained in conventional mode. Elemental recognition indicates a lead-tin-based glaze.  \n\n \n\nFrom figure 4.7 one sees that the elemental distribution of the glazes is quite similar among \n\nthe three different groups of samples. From the spectra the only differences identified are \n\nhigher concentrations of Ca, Zn and Pb and lower of Sn in the faience sample in comparison to \n\nthe wall-tiles from Coimbra and Lisbon. The four peaks assigned as \u201cMo-inc\u201d and \u201cMo-coh\u201d \n\ncorrespond to the incoherent (Compton) and coherent (Rayleigh) lines characteristic from the \n\nanode material (Mo) of the X-ray tube, respectively. \n\nThe elemental variability in these samples is broad and it is important to mention here that \n\nthere are elements present, such as B, Na and Mg, which cannot be detected by this \n\nexperimental system.  \n\n\n\n82 \n \n\nIn order to assign possible groups regarding the chemical information of the different types \n\nof ceramic objects here investigated, statistical clustering methods were a choice for such \n\npurposes. The input data for the dendrogram in figure 4.9 are the net peak areas of the \n\nelements that mostly characterize the glazes: Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Sn and Pb.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.8 \u2013 Dendrogram representing the clusters formed with the elemental data obtained from \n\nconventional XRF. Three clusters are unambiguously formed. \n\n \n\nFrom the dendrogram (figure 4.8) one sees that three clusters can be clearly identified. \n\nCluster 1 comprises Coimbra samples only, cluster 2 has a mixture of both Coimbra and Lisbon \n\nsamples and cluster 3 includes samples from Lisbon only.  \n\nOne of the most characteristic features of the presented samples is opacifying character of \n\nthe glazes, owed to introduction of cassiterite (SnO2) in the chemical composition. A ternary \n\ndiagram between silicon (Si), lead (Pb) and tin (Sn) is plotted in figure 4.9. The data points \n\ncorrespond to net peak areas from the fitted XRF spectra (in conventional mode). These \n\nelements were chosen due to their role in glazes, as previously described (cf. chapter 1). Si has \n\na structural role in the glaze as is a network-forming agent; Pb has a network-modifier nature \n\nand Sn was introduced as an opacifier agent. Differences between these three elements (or \n\n\n\n83 \n \n\ncompounds) will provide a first-approach confirmation about the use of these raw materials \n\nand, hence, about the manufacturing processes. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.9 \u2013 Ternary diagram Si-Sn-Pb with net peak areas obtained by conventional XRF on glazes of \n\nall analyzed samples: utility faiences from Coimbra (?), wall-tiles from Coimbra (?) and wall-tiles from \n\nLisbon (?).  \n\n \n\nFrom figure 4.9 one can identify two distinct groups of data. The faience samples (Coimbra) \n\nare emphasized by lower counts of Sn and higher counts of Pb in comparison to the wall-tile \n\nsamples (Coimbra and Lisbon). At this point finding correlations between elemental data will be \n\nuseful to trace the choice of raw materials for both manufacturing centers as well as different \n\ntypes of objects (faiences and tiles). For this purpose, Spearman correlation tests were \n\nperformed for the different groups of samples (faiences and tiles).

Further developments on this part will be \n\ngiven further on (cf. section 4.2.3).  \n\nAs complementary information, it is important to investigate the stratigraphy of the samples \n\nfor estimating the thickness of each layer and especially the elemental distribution in depth. \n\nTherefore, 3D Micro-XRF analyses were performed (cf. chapter 3, sub-section 3.1.3).  \n\n\n\n86 \n \n\nThree cross-section scans on glaze + body were carried out for each sample. Figures 4.10a \n\nand 4.10b shows the elemental profiles for a faience from Coimbra and a wall-tile from Lisbon, \n\nrespectively. A key element for each important region in the stratigraphy of the samples was \n\ninspected \u2013 Pb and Sn for the glaze and Ca for the ceramic body.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.10 \u2013 3D Micro-XRF cross section scans performed on glaze + ceramic support on: a) a faience \n\nfrom Coimbra and b) a wall-tile from Lisbon [37]. \n\n \n\nFollowing the Pb-L? profiles for all analyzed sample it was realized that faiences have glaze \n\nthickness between 150 \u2013 250 \u00b5m, while the glaze of wall-tiles (both from Coimbra and Lisbon) is \n\nbetween 300 \u2013 400 \u00b5m thick. Although glazes also contain Ca, this element is mostly \n\ncharacteristic for the ceramic body as it is depicted in figure 4.10. A very interesting point is the \n\nregion where the connection between two main parts of the sample occurs (what it will be \n\ncalled \u00b4interface area\u00b4 from this point forth). Comparing the profiles between figure 4.10a and \n\n4.10b (plotted over the images obtained by the microscope inside the confocal setup) one sees \n\nthat at the glaze/body interface the elemental exchange for the faience samples from Coimbra \n\nhappens in a smoother way (approximately 50 ?m) than for the wall-tiles from Lisbon (less than \n\n30 ?m).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n87 \n \n\nScanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry (SEM/EDX) \n\nIn order to prove the assumptions above, the use of techniques that provide compositional \n\nand morphological information is a requirement. Hence, SEM/EDX analyses were performed \n\nonto the glazes of some samples.  At this point it is important to emphasize that given the \n\nheterogeneity among these objects, quantitative results obtained with EDX will be here \n\npresented just as an estimation of the content at a specific area. Hence, these will not be \n\nconsidered as providing representative quantitative information of the whole piece/area.  \n\nFigure 4.11 shows two examples of the elemental distribution on the glaze surfaces of one \n\nfaience form Coimbra (a) and one wall-tile form Lisbon (b). The image contrast provides \n\ninformation about the atomic number (Z) of a certain area/spot. Dark sots/areas correspond to \n\nlow-Z compounds and bright ones to high-Z compounds. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.11 \u2013 SEM micrographs taken on the glaze surface of a faience sample from Coimbra (a) and a \n\nwall-tile sample from Lisbon (b).  \n\n \n\nObserving figure 4.11a one can identify quartz phases (dark spots) confirmed by the EDX \n\nspectrum (#3, in orange) due the presence of Si and O only. Areas #1 and #2 represent a more \n\nuniform contribution of all compounds present in the glaze, where Na, Al, Si, K, Ca, Fe, Sn and \n\nPb are identified by the EDX spectrum.  \n\nSodium is a key element for glaze characterization, which could not be detected by XRF. In \n\ntable 4.3, quantities for the elements in glaze surfaces detected by EDX for all analyzed samples \n\n\n\n88 \n \n\nare presented. These measurements were taken under a low magnification (wide-area) and the \n\nmorphology of the cross-section was taken into account in order to better estimate the \n\nconcentrations. \n\n \n\nTable 4.3 \u2013 Elemental composition of glazes of the samples (N is the number of samples analyzed) \n\nfrom Coimbra and Lisbon (in wt-%) obtained with standardless EDX (wide-area).

In order to evaluate the morphology of the glazes, a series of \n\nmicrographs is presented in figure 4.12. \n\n \n\n\n\n89 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.12 \u2013 SEM micrographs: a) cross-section of a faience from Coimbra (low-mag.); b) cross-\n\nsection of a faience (interface glaze/body is observed at the bottom); c) enhancement of the same \n\nsample, where the deposition of cassiterite crystals is observed; d) high magnification on the cassiterite \n\ncrystals, supported by the EDX results. \n\n  \n\nGeneral features of the glazes: \n\n- From the micrograph in figure 4.12a one realizes how smooth the interface \n\nglaze/body is, meaning that there was a good adhesion between glaze and ceramic \n\nsupport; \n\n- The brightness of the glaze (also confirmed by figure 4.12b) indicates that the \n\nmatrix average atomic number is medium-high.  \n\n- The quartz grains are observable as dark spots, which shape varies from sphere-\n\nlike to more oblong, with sizes up to around 60 \u00b5m (figures 4.12b and 4.12c);  \n\n- Feldspars are identified with sizes up to 5 \u00b5m;  \n\n\n\n90 \n \n\n- Cassiterite (SnO2) crystals are typically found in this type of ceramic glazes and \n\nthe crystals size is around 1 \u00b5m and less; With a high magnification (figures 4.12c and \n\n4.12d) one can see that these crystals form agglomerates and are well distributed in the \n\nglaze.  \n\n \n\nAs a last example of the morphology of the glazes figure 4.13 exhibits two micrographs, one \n\nfrom a faience form Coimbra (a) and one from a wall-tile from Lisbon (b). One can see how well \n\ndistributed the tin oxide crystals are within the glassy matrix. Their length varies between for 1 \n\nand 2 ?m for the former (a) and between 0.5 and 0.8 ?m for the latter (b). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.13 \u2013 SEM micrographs taken on the glaze surface of a faience sample from Coimbra (a) and a \n\nwall-tile sample from Lisbon (b), with high magnification [37]. \n\n \n\n4.2.3 \u2013 Surface decoration \n\nConcerning polychrome glazed ceramics, some facts must be taken into account. The colors \n\nemployed on the pieces were usually obtained from metallic oxides, which could have been \n\nused in a \u201craw\u201d state or in a mixture called frit, which is a pre-melting of the pigment together \n\nwith fluxes, such as Pb, Na, and sometimes even Sn (to make it more opaque). After cooling \n\ndown, this mixture (frit) was grinded until a powder was obtained and then applied over the \n\n\u201cbase glaze\u201d (cf. figure 1.7). The brilliance or opacity and the migration ability of the elements, \n\nwhich grant the color, are some factors that help assign the way the pigment was applied \n\nonto/within the glaze [33, 37]. \n\n\n\n91 \n \n\nIn figure 4.14 XRF spectra from the four most used colors (blue, purple, green and yellow) \n\nare plotted. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.14 \u2013 XRF spectra \u2013 obtained in conventional mode \u2013 correspondent to blue, purple, green \n\nand yellow colors respectively.  \n\n \n\nFrom these spectra key elements \u2013 that characterize each color \u2013 can be identified: Cobalt \n\n(Co) for blue, Manganese (Mn) (and possibly Barium (Ba)) for purple, Copper (Co) for green and \n\nAntimony (Sb) for yellow.  \n\n \n\n4.2.3.1 \u2013 Blue pigment \n\n \n\nX-ray Fluorescence (XRF) \n\nBlue is without a doubt the most common color for (Portuguese) glazed ceramic decoration. \n\nIts common association with majesty made it the most required color for this purpose. \n\nFrom figure 4.14 the typical elements detected are Fe, Co, Ni and As (Smalt).  According to \n\nthe literature [27], the use of Co-pigments until about the 12\nth\n\n century AD is related to two \n\nmineral ores only:  i) Qamsar and Anarak in Persia and ii) the Erzgebirge \u2013 Ore Mountains \u2013 at \n\n\n\n92 \n \n\nthe border between Saxony (Germany) and Bohemia (Czech Republic). These were geologically \n\nrich enough to support a trade route over Europe, North Africa and the East (till China). The \n\nmain mining industry in the Erzgebirge was Silver (Ag), whose minerals were found admixed in \n\nthe so-called \u00b4five-element\u00b4 veins (Ni-Co-As-Ag-Bi). Since then, the Erzgebirge has supplied the \n\nCo-pigment market to a large extent.  \n\nThe decorative motives as well as the hues used, make the difference. Measurements with \n\nthe conventional XRF setup were performed on blue areas, and in order to identify the \n\nelements from the color a spectra from the glaze next to these areas was subtracted. In figure \n\n4.15, spectra \u2013 obtained by conventional XRF \u2013 from blue areas in faiences from Coimbra and \n\nwall-tiles from Coimbra and Lisbon are presented.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.15 \u2013 XRF spectra from blue regions from faiences from Coimbra and wall-tiles from Coimbra \n\nand Lisbon. \n\n \n\nFrom figure 4.15 a difference in the shape of the spectra between faiences and wall-tiles is \n\nobserved. Since blue painted regions were much smaller in faiences than in wall-tiles, X-ray \n\n\n\n93 \n \n\nexcitation was performed using the polycapillary lens for faiences. This way one restrains the \n\ndesired analyzed and has no overlap with adjacent colors. The shape of the background in the \n\nspectrum corresponding to the faience in figure 4.15 is in agreement with the theory of \n\npolycapillary lenses (cf. chapter 3, sub-section 3.1.2)  \n\nAn interesting feature detected on these spectra is that there seems to appear a peak on the \n\nright side of the Pb-L? line, which energy would correspond to Bismuth (Bi-L?). Given the \n\ninherent instrumental limitations in terms of energy resolution, long measurements (of 30 min.) \n\nwere carried out on the blue areas of each sample.  For this purpose (and to assure that the \n\nupper layer is selected), 3D Micro-XRF measurements were performed placing the probing \n\nvolume on the upper layer (blue). \n\n  \n\nFigure 4.16 \u2013 Comparison between blue and glaze spectra, performed with 3D Micro-XRF on the \n\nupper layer of each area. The shoulder appearing on the right side of both Pb-L? and Pb-L? indicates the \n\npresence of Bismuth (Bi) in the blue. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.16 shows that with long measuring time, both lines of Bismuth (L? and L?) become \n\nemphasized, when compared with respective glaze. In order to evaluate whether the presence \n\nof the elements that are \u201clinked\u201d to Cobalt is found in all samples or not, net counts for these \n\nelements were compared between the different kinds of samples. \n\n \n\n\n\n94 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.17 \u2013 a) Plot of the elemental net counts for Al, K, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, As, Bi for faiences from \n\nCoimbra (Coimbra F), wall-tiles from Coimbra (Coimbra T) and wall-tiles from Lisbon (Lisbon T); b) \n\ncomparison elemental ratios (Mn/Co, Fe/Co, Ni/Co, Bi/Co) between faiences from Coimbra (Coimbra F), \n\nwall-tiles from Coimbra (Coimbra T) and wall-tiles from Lisbon (Lisbon T). \n\n \n\nFrom figure 4.17a one sees that the wall-tiles (Coimbra T and Lisbon T) show higher count \n\nrates for Ni and Bi and lower count rates for Mn in comparison to the faiences (Coimbra F). This \n\nis easier to observe by the ratio plot in figure 4.17b, where an increase of the Ni/Co (light-blue \n\nline) and Bi/Co (orange line) and a drop of the Mn/Co (red line) for the wall-tiles are observed \n\n(right hand-side of the grey dashed line). The ratio Fe/Co (blue line) keeps more or less \n\nunchanged between faiences and wall-tiles. Furthermore, the fact that the source of Co has \n\n\u201ccontaminant\u201d elements such as Fe, Ni, As and Bi, allows inferring about the time at which \n\nthese objects were manufactures. According to Van der Linden et al. [28], the more recent the \n\nobject is, the higher the \u201cpurity\u201d of the Co-source that was employed is. In figure 4.18, the \n\nAs/Ni ratio is plotted against the Co/Fe ratio. \n\n \n\n\n\n95 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.18 \u2013 As/Ni square-root net counts ratio plotted against Co/Fe square-root net counts ratio, \n\nfor both faiences (Coimbra) and wall-tiles (Coimbra &amp; Lisbon). \n\n \n\nFrom figure 4.18 one sees a negative linear relationship between As/Ni and Co/Fe for both \n\nfaiences (Coimbra) and wall-tiles (Coimbra &amp; Lisbon). However, looking at both scales, the \n\ndifference with the Co/Fe and As/Ni ratio does not vary much, which means that the whole set \n\nof pieces belongs to the same period.  \n\nIn order to assign possible groups regarding the chemical information of the blue used in the \n\ndifferent pieces, statistical clustering methods were chosen (cf. chapter 3, section 3.5 \u2013 \n\nstatistical data handling). The input data for the dendrogram in figure 4.19 are the net peak \n\nareas of the elements that mostly characterize the blue color together with the respective \n\nglaze: Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, As, Sn, Bi and Pb.  \n\n\n\n96 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.19 \u2013 Dendrogram showing the clusters formed with the elemental data of the blue. Two \n\nclusters are unambiguously formed: cluster 1 \u2013 faiences from Coimbra (Coimbra F); cluster 2 \u2013 wall-tiles \n\nfrom Coimbra and Lisbon (Coimbra T and Lisbon T). \n\n \n\nFrom figure 4.19 one realizes two distinct clusters \u2013 one for faiences from Coimbra (Coimbra \n\nF) and one for wall-tiles (Coimbra T and Lisbon T) \u2013 with a big distance. However, cluster 2 could \n\nbe sub-divided into two clusters, as there is a smaller distinct division between wall-tiles from \n\nCoimbra (Coimbra T) and wall-tiles from Lisbon (Lisbon T). \n\nSpearman correlation tests were performed for the different groups of samples (faiences \n\nand tiles). Table 4.4 shows the correlation coefficients between the elements that characterize \n\nthe blue of faiences from Coimbra, table 4.5 the blue of wall-tiles from Coimbra and table 4.6 \n\nthe blue of wall-tiles from Lisbon.

The results \n\nreported here correspond to an average of three measurements per analyzed cross-section. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n100 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.20 \u2013 3D Micro-XRF cross section scans performed on blue + glaze + ceramic support on: a) a \n\nfaience from Coimbra and b) a wall-tile from Lisbon [37]. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.20 shows an example of the elemental dispersion in depth for a faience from \n\nCoimbra (a) and wall-tile from Lisbon (b). \n\nFrom the elemental profile two main differences are observed: i) the glaze of the faience \n\nfrom Coimbra is thinner (ca. 150 \u00b5m) than the one from the wall-tile from Lisbon (ca. 400 \u00b5m), \n\nas previously shown; ii) by monitoring the Co K-line, the pigment is distributed throughout the \n\nwhole glaze in the faience sample (figure 4.20a) while in the wall-tile the pigment dissemination \n\nis about 100 \u00b5m in depth. On one hand, either there is no interface between color/glaze in the \n\nsample from Coimbra or is less than the resolution allowed for the 3D Micro-XRF. This may \n\nindicate that glaze and pigment were applied together, as it is also proved by the Co-K and Pb-\n\nL? profiles (figure 4.20a). On the other hand, there is an interface color/glaze in the sample \n\nfrom Lisbon (figure 4.20b). However, the pigment disseminates quite well through the glaze, \n\nwhich is also proved by the profiles obtained for Co-K and Pb-L?. In both cases Sn is more \n\nabundant in the lower part of the glaze, being dominant in the sample from Coimbra (figure \n\n4.20a). This is in agreement with the assumption that tin crystals are very dense and deposit on \n\nthe lower part of the glaze. \n\nIn order to complement the information above, these scans were performed with high \n\nlateral resolution (1 \u00b5m) at the BAMline @ BESSY-II (Berlin, Germany) [39]. For focusing the \n\nincident X-ray beam Compound Refractive Lenses (CRLs) were used. Further technical details of \n\nthe experiment are previously described (cf. chapter 3, sub-section 3.1.4). The scans were \n\n\n\n101 \n \n\nperformed, in the same way as the ones for 3D Micro-XRF. The results reported here \n\ncorrespond to an average of three measurements per analyzed cross-section. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.21 \u2013 Cross-section scans were performed through the blue/glaze/body of two samples from \n\nCoimbra \u2013 (a) faience and (b) wall-tile \u2013 and a wall-tile from Lisbon (c) [39]. \n\n \n\nPictures taken with the incorporated microscope, in which the different areas of each \n\nsample are easy to observe, are also displayed in figure 4.21. The red line in these pictures gives \n\nan idea of how the scans were accomplished, from the top of the surface down to the ceramic \n\nbody.  \n\nThe scans compare the Co-K, Pb-L and Fe-K signals, which characterize blue, glaze and body, \n\nrespectively. Tracing the Co signal in the faience sample, one sees that the glaze and surface \n\ndecoration exist as one layer together. The glaze is thin and the pigment was applied together \n\nwith the glaze in one firing stage. Comparison of the Co-signal between the two tiles shows that \n\nits maximum is broader in the sample from Coimbra (ca. 150 \u00b5m \u2013 figure 4.21b) than in the one \n\nfrom Lisbon (ca. 125 \u00b5m \u2013 figure 4.21c). Another point is that the Pb-signal in the wall-tiles from \n\nCoimbra (figure 4.21b) has an abrupt drop in the interface glaze/body. There is a smooth drop \n\n\n\n102 \n \n\nof the Pb-signal when reaching the body of the sample from Lisbon (figure 4.21c), allowing a \n\nhigher intake of the glaze throughout the body. In addition, the Fe-signal (mainly characteristic \n\nof the ceramic body) is higher at the interface glaze/body in the sample from Lisbon than in the \n\nsample from Coimbra.  \n\n \n\nScanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry (SEM/EDX) \n\nIt is known that in addition to the choice and preparation of the materials, the firing and \n\ncooling conditions play an important role in the granularity and differences in the spatial \n\ndistributions of the finished composition [27]. Therefore, it is crucial to infer about the \n\nstratigraphy of these objects, as there is no typical expected layered-system in such items. \n\nHence, it becomes necessary to gain knowledge about the morphology not only of the glazes \n\nbut also of the pigments. In the case of blue pigments although Co is the color-carrier, a linkage \n\nbetween several elements exists: Fe-Co-Ni-As-Bi, as mentioned above. Moreover, tracing the \n\nCo-signal throughout the glaze one realizes how diffused this pigment is.  \n\nIn figure 4.22a a cross-section of the blue-colored glaze from a faience sample from Coimbra \n\nis presented. Several Cassiterite (SnO2) agglomerates throughout the whole glaze \u2013 from top to \n\nbottom (marked by white circles) - are observed. Figure 4.22b represents an enlargement of \n\none of the areas containing SnO2 agglomerates. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n103 \n \n\n \n\n Figure 4.22 \u2013 SEM micrographs on the \u201cblue\u201d sample areas: a) cross-section of a faience sample \n\nfrom Coimbra (low magnification) with visualization of Cassiterite (SnO2) agglomerates (white marks) \n\nand Fe-Co-Ni structures (blue marks); b) enlargement of one area of the SnO2 agglomerates and c) EDX \n\nspectrum taken from the area shown in (b) demonstrating the massive presence of Sn. 239x87mm (150 \n\nx 150 DPI) [94]. \n\n \n\nThe presence of Sn in the agglomerates as those in figure 4.22b is clearly proven by the EDX \n\nspectrum shown in figure 4.22c. The Fe-Co-Ni structures (marked by blue circles) are rather \n\nscarce in the whole region, plus they are found somewhat \u201cburied\u201d in the glaze (around 100 \u00b5m \n\nin depth according to figure 4.22a), in agreement with Zucchiatti et al. [27]. This means that \n\ngiven the heterogeneity in these objects, together with the fact that the excitation volume of \n\nthe X-ray electron probe microanalysis in such matrices (at the high-voltages employed) is \n\nabout 1-3 \u00b5m (cf. chapter 3, sub-section 3.3.1), the EDX analyses of the Fe-Co-Ni structures \n\nbecome a real challenge in this case. \n\nFrom the structures found in figure 4.22, the amount of Sn-agglomerates in the blue regions \n\nis a hint for a particular manufacturing process. Co-blue is in its natural state a very strong and \n\ndark blue, which is not the hue in the blue surface motifs, by naked-eye observation. So, since \n\nSn is a natural white-opacifier, one can deduce that the potter added it intentionally to the \n\npigment in order to obtain a lighter blue hue. \n\n\n\n104 \n \n\nThe micrograph in Figure 4.23a corresponds to a blue-painted surface of a faience sample \n\nfrom Coimbra. Some needle-like structures (figure 4.23b) correspond to As-compounds, which \n\nmarkedly were found in blue regions only. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.23 \u2013 SEM micrographs of a surface area of a faience from Coimbra (low magnification (a) \n\nand high magnification (b)) with visualization of Arsenic needle-like structure; c) EDX spectra \n\ncorrespondent to the areas marked in a) demonstrating the presence of As in the bright needle-like \n\nstructures; Note that a Fe-Ni-rich structure could be also identified (see point #1 in c) by EDX. \n\n238x80mm (150 x 150 DPI) [94]. \n\n \n\nThe EDX spectra from figure 4.23c correspond to the areas marked in figure 4.23a. The \n\nanalytical challenges described above are here demonstrated. The EDX spectra taken from the \n\narea #1 and area #2 in figure 4.23a show no significant Co peaks (K? @ 6.93 keV and L? @ 0.77 \n\nkeV). However, the presence of other elements that are linked with the Co-structure, such as \n\nFe, are observed. Moreover, the L-line of As is well detected, especially in the spectrum \n\ncorresponding to area #3. This is easily observed by the higher concentration of \u201cbright\u201d As-\n\nstructures (needle-like). Figure 4.23b corresponds to an enlargement of area #3 from figure \n\n4.23a. Point #1 in figure 4.24c is is obviously rich in Fe \u2013 shown by the correspondent EDX \n\nspectrum. Furthermore, this structure is presumably rather thin in comparison to the needle-\n\nlike structures, as one can see by the \u201cshade\u201d it provokes on the As-structure in figure 4.23b. \n\nThe EDX spectra of points #2, 3 and 4 show the presence of As-L line (1.28 keV), while for point \n\n#1 the line which partially overlaps this one is Mg-K (1.25 keV). \n\n\n\n105 \n \n\nA comparison between micrographs taken with high magnification on blue painted regions \n\nfrom samples from the two locations, Coimbra and Lisbon, is made. Figure 4.24 shows \n\nexamples of blue surfaces from two faiences from Coimbra. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.24 \u2013 SEM micrographs: a) surface of a faience from Coimbra with visualization of the mixture \n\nbetween Sn-crystals and Fe-Ni-rich structures; b) EDX spectra correspondent to the point analysis \n\nmarked in a); c) surface of a faience from Coimbra with visualization of Fe-Ni-rich structures, dispersed \n\nthroughout the whole colored area; d) EDX spectra corresponding to the points marked in c). 168x90mm \n\n(150 x 150 DPI) [94]. \n\n \n\nIn figure 4.24a a smooth mixture of dark and bright zones is observable, which corresponds \n\nto the Fe-containing structures and Sn-crystals, respectively (figure 4.24b). Figure 4.24c \n\ncorresponds to another Coimbra faience sample and in this case, the Fe-containing structures \n\nare more dispersed at the surface level. \n\n\n\n106 \n \n\nRegarding wall-tile samples, figure 4.25 shows a micrograph taken onto the surface of a wall-\n\ntile from Lisbon, at a low magnification. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.25 \u2013 SEM micrographs of two Lisbon wall-tile samples in the blue painted areas together \n\nwith EDX spectra (b and d) on selected spots demonstrating the presence of Fe-Mn-rich or Ni-rich micro-\n\nstructures. 175x80mm (150 x 150 DPI) [94]. \n\n  \n\nIn figure 4.25a darker and brighter relatively large regions are observed. Comparing this \n\nsurface micrograph with the one from figures 4.23a and b (faience from Coimbra), As-structures \n\n(needle-like) are not observable in the wall-tile sample at similar magnifications. This is also \n\nconfirmed by the EDX spectra in figure 4.25b, where As-lines were not detected. According to \n\nZucchiatti et al. [27], As is found in the glaze with connection to Ca and Pb only and in fact there \n\nis a lower intensity for Pb-M and Ca-K lines in the spectrum of figure 4.25b. There is, however, a \n\nhigher areal concentration of Sb-compounds \u2013 see e. g. area #3 in figure 4.23a and the \n\nrespective EDX spectrum in red (figure 4.25b) \u2013 in comparison to the faience surface in figures \n\n\n\n107 \n \n\n4.23a and b, which indicates the presence of yellow painted regions close to the blue regions. \n\nFigure 4.25c is an enlargement of area #3 in figure 4.25a. Some micro- and submicro-structures \n\nare observed and the blurry appearance indicates that these are somewhat \u201cburied\u201d in the \n\ndepth of the blue-glaze. However, one of these structures seems to \u201ctouch\u201d the surface (blue \n\npoint in figure 4.25c), see the respective EDX spectrum in figure 4.25d. Ni, Co and Mn were \n\nclearly detected in this structure. By the count rate ratio between these elements, a Ni-rich \n\nstructure encloses the Co-blue pigment, in comparison to the ones from Coimbra, where a Fe-\n\nrich environment is found. \n\n \n\n4.2.3.2 \u2013 Yellow pigment \n\n \n\nX-ray Fluorescence (XRF) \n\nBy naked eye observation, faiences from Coimbra exhibit bright yellow decoration (except \n\none sample); the wall-tiles from Coimbra show a mate yellow-orange hue and the wall-tiles \n\nfrom Lisbon have relatively bright yellow decorations (cf. Annex 1.3).  \n\nSurface analyses with conventional XRF were performed on all yellow regions on the samples \n\nand in figure 4.26 spectra from: one faience (Coimbra) and wall-tiles (one from Coimbra and \n\none from Lisbon) are plotted. \n\n \n\n\n\n108 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.26 \u2013 XRF spectra: a) yellow regions from faiences from Coimbra (Coimbra F) and wall-tiles \n\nfrom Coimbra (Coimbra T) and Lisbon (Lisbon T); b) comparison between yellow and glaze of a faience \n\nfrom Coimbra; c) comparison between yellow and glaze of a wall-tile from Lisbon. \n\n \n\nFrom the spectra in figure 4.26a one sees that the color yellow is owed to the presence of \n\nAntinomy (Sb). Along with this element, Pb and Sn seem to be in strong association \u2013 by the \n\nstrong count rate in both Coimbra and Lisbon samples (figures 4.26b and 4.26c). The lead-\n\nantimonate pigment \u2013 also known as Naples Yellow (Pb2Sb2O7) \u2013 was commonly used for the \n\nyellow motifs [22]. Samples from Coimbra show higher count rates for Mn and Fe than the ones \n\nfrom Lisbon (figure 4.26a), which may justify the more orange hue in the former. Additional \n\nconsiderations about the chemical environment related to the yellow pigment are presented \n\nfurther on. \n\n\n\n109 \n \n\nOn a first approach to complement the consideration so far made, 3D Micro-XRF scans on \n\nthe cross-section of samples from Coimbra and Lisbon are presented. The results here reported \n\ncorrespond to an average of three measurements per analyzed cross-section. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.27 \u2013 3D Micro-XRF cross section scans performed on yellow + glaze + ceramic support on: a) \n\na faience from Coimbra and b) a wall-tile from Lisbon [37]. \n\n \n\nFrom figure 4.27 one realizes that the yellow pigment is distinguished from the base glaze, \n\nwhether in Coimbra or in Lisbon samples. Tracing the Sb-Ka line, a thickness of about 30 \u00b5m is \n\nobtained for the yellow layer in the faience from Coimbra (figure 4.27a) and about 80 \u00b5m for \n\nthe yellow layer in the wall-tile from Lisbon. Tracing the Pb-La line, a thickness of about 150 \u00b5m \n\nis obtained for the glaze of the faience from Coimbra (figure 4.27a) and a thickness of ca. 300 \n\n\u00b5m is obtained for the wall-tile from Lisbon (figure 4.27b) [37]. In agreement to the results \n\nabove, the Fe-signal was detected in the yellow layer from the sample from Coimbra (red line in \n\nfigure 4.27a) while in the sample from Lisbon it starts just at the base glaze (red line in figure \n\n4.27b). Furthermore, in the sample from Coimbra both Pb- and Sn-signal start approximately at \n\nthe same place as the Sb-signal (figure 4.27a) and in the sample from Lisbon the Pb-signal starts \n\njust about 30 \u00b5m after the Sb-signal, while the Sn-signal accompanies the Sb-signal (figure \n\n4.27b). \n\n\n\n110 \n \n\nIn order to complement the information above, these scans were performed with high \n\nlateral resolution (1 \u00b5m), again at the BAMline @ BESSY-II (Berlin, Germany) [39]. The scans \n\nwere performed, in the same way as the ones for 3D Micro-XRF. The results reported here \n\ncorrespond to an average of three measurements per analyzed cross-section. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.28 \u2013 Cross-section scans were performed through the blue/glaze/body of two samples from \n\nCoimbra \u2013 (a) faience and (b) wall-tile \u2013 and a wall-tile from Lisbon (c) [39]. \n\n \n\nIn figure 4.28a one sees that the pigment layer (30 \u00b5m) is not completely dispersed into the \n\nglaze (ca. 180 \u00b5m). One can also see that Pb keeps throughout the whole glaze until the first \n\ntens of micrometers of the body. Comparing the profiles of figures 4.28b and 4.28c, it is obvious \n\nthat the pigment layers of both samples have about the same thickness (about 100 \u00b5m); \n\nConversely to what happens in figure 4.28a, the Pb signal accompanying the pigment in wall-\n\ntiles from Coimbra and Lisbon drops (figures 4.28b and 4.28c), being more abruptly for the \n\n\n\n111 \n \n\nformer. Moreover, the Pb-signal does is not observed in the first tens of micrometers of the \n\nbody [39]. \n\n \n\nScanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry (SEM/EDX) \n\nRepresentative SEM micrographs taken on the \u201cyellow\u201d surface of one of each type of object \n\nare displayed in figure 4.29. \n\n \n\n\n\n112 \n \n\nFigure 4.29 \u2013 SEM micrographs of yellow painted areas of the surface of (a) a Coimbra faience \n\nsample, (d) a Coimbra wall-tile sample, and (g) a Lisbon wall-tile sample. On the right side EDX spectra \n\non selected spots and further high-mag micrographs are shown. 153x160mm (150 x 150 DPI) [94]. \n\n \n\nThe faiences from Coimbra exhibit localized very bright areas (for example area #3 in figure \n\n4.29a), which correspond to the local higher density of Sb-crystals \u2013 as shown by the respective \n\nEDX spectra in figure 4.29b. The wall-tiles from Coimbra appear in figure 4.29d relatively darker \n\nin general with lower local density of Sb-compounds \u2013 as indicated by the EDX spectra (figure \n\n4.29e). The wall-tiles from Lisbon shows, in figure 4.29g, a more uniform mixture of bright and \n\ndarker regions, which indicates a quite homogeneous distribution of the Sb-crystals \u2013 shown by \n\nthe EDX spectra of all marked regions on the micrograph (figure 4.29h). High-magnification \n\nmicrographs (figures 4.29c, 4290f and 4.29i) were also taken onto the yellow surface areas from \n\nthe samples together with the respective EDX spectra.  \n\nThe rough concentration of the elements present in yellow regions as detected by EDX for all \n\nanalyzed samples were calculated by using the commercial standardless quantification routines \n\noffered by one of the EDS systems employed (NSS 300 Thermo Fisher Scientific). The \n\ncorresponding measurements were taken at a low magnification, i. e. integrating over larger \n\nareas, and the morphology of the cross-section was checked as well in order to better evaluate \n\nthe concentrations.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n113 \n \n\nTable 4.7 \u2013 Elemental composition of the yellow regions of the samples (N is the number of samples \n\nanalyzed) from Coimbra and Lisbon (in wt-%) obtained with standardless EDX (wide-area).

Furthermore, the presence of Sn \n\nindicates that the Sn-ions may participate in the crystalline structure that forms the yellow \n\npigment \u2013 possibly by replacing Sb [95]. Other elements, which are embedded in the glaze \n\nmatrix, such as Si, are also identified in these spectra due to the rather large analyzed volume. \n\nAnother interesting perspective to observe the way the Sb-crystals are spread through the \n\nglaze is shown in figure 4.30. Clearly the Sb-crystals keep at the first tens of micrometers \n\nbeneath the surface \u2013 marked in yellow circles.  \n\n \n\n\n\n114 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.30 \u2013 a) SEM micrograph of a cross-sectioned Coimbra faience sample in an yellow painted \n\narea; b) EDX spectrum corresponding to the areas marked with yellow in a) demonstrating the presence \n\nof Sb. 219x91mm (150 x 150 DPI) [94]. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.31 shows the differences between the morphology of the Sb-crystals between wall \n\ntiles from Coimbra and Lisbon. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.31 \u2013 a) SEM micrographs showing Sb-crystals at the surface a wall tile from Coimbra (a) and \n\na wall tile from Lisbon (b) 234x91mm (150 x 150 DPI) [94]. \n\n \n\n\n\n115 \n \n\nThe size of the crystals is smaller in the sample from Coimbra (faiences and wall-tiles \u2013 \n\nfigures 4.30a and 4.30b) than in the samples from Lisbon (figure 4.30c). The crystal size is about \n\n1-2 ?m for the former and about 5-10 ?m for the latter. Furthermore the crystal-shape is \n\ndifferent: in faiences and wall-tiles from Coimbra they are triangular-like while in wall-tiles from \n\nLisbon they have a well-formed hexagonal shape (figures 4.31a and 4.31b). \n\n \n\nX-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS)  \n\nRegarding the yellow pigment used for decoration in glazed ceramic objects, questions about \n\nthe structural nature of the most common yellow pigment \u2013 Naples Yellow (Pb2Sb2O7) \u2013 \n\nemerged. This lead-antimonate yellow pigment is a synthetic pigment, normally obtained by \n\ncalcination of a mixture of ore compounds. This is a thermal treatment process in which the \n\ncompounds are heated below their fusing point, causing decomposition of carbonates, among \n\nothers. In order to obtain Naples yellow, lead compounds (metallic lead, lead monoxide and \n\nlead white) were calcinated together with antimony compounds (metallic antimony, antimony \n\ntrioxide and potassium antimonate or antimony sulfide). A more detailed description about the \n\nused compounds for calcination as well as their possible ratios is presented by Dik et al. [96]. \n\nDuring the calcination process other elements, such as Al, Si or Zn, were added and therefore \n\nthey serve as hint for the recipes used. \n\nThe pyrochlore-type lead-antimonate was commonly used as pigment for the yellow hues, \n\nhowever previous investigations on the yellow decorated parts have indicated the presence of \n\nother elements such as Sn or Zn [37]. This suggests either the use of other compounds or \n\nchanges in the original pyrochlore-type. Four distinct yellow components were mostly used in \n\npaintings and glass manufacture: 1) the orthorhombic lead-tin yellow I (Pb2SnO4); 2) the cubic \n\npyrochlore lead-tin yellow II (PbSn1-xSixO3); 3) the cubic pyrochlore lead-antimonate (Pb2Sb2O7); \n\n4) the cubic pyrochlore lead-tin antimonate yellow (Pb2Sb2-xSnxO6.5) [18, 19, 22]. A detailed \n\ndescription about recipes used to obtain these pigments as well as the crystal structure \n\ncharacterization is given by Clark et al. [97].  \n\nIn order to distinguish such fine details, a chemically-sensitive technique is required. \n\nInformation about the coordination geometry and local environment of the investigated \n\n\n\n116 \n \n\nelement are sought and therefore X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) analyses were carried \n\nout on both Pb-L3 and Sb-K edges. For this purpose, a set of original samples, some prepared \n\nreplica and reference materials were analyzed. In addition, theoretical simulations \n\n(modulations) of the Pb and Sb XAFS spectra, assuming different valences, were performed.  \n\nWith the aim of finding differences in manufacturing techniques of the two main glazed \n\nceramic production centers in Portugal (Coimbra and Lisbon),  it is of great importance to learn \n\nabout the Sb and Pb chemical environment and understand the role of these cations within the \n\npigment and the glassy matrix [98]. The electron configuration of Sb: [Kr2 4d\n10\n\n5s\n2\n5p\n\n3\n allows the \n\nformal valences of (+3) and (+5). The electron pair 5s\n2\n of Sb(III) is strongly localized and induces \n\nan asymmetric coordination and the three bonds point away from this lone electron pair, \n\nforming a trigonal pyramidal coordination (figure 4.32). Conversely, Sb(V) is octahedral \n\ncoordinated to 6 oxygen atoms, in line with the symmetric 4d\n10\n\n electron configuration (figure \n\n4.32) [99]. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.32 \u2013 Coordination of Sb(III) and Sb(V) in oxide minerals. Oxygen atoms are indicated by the \n\nsmaller balls. For both oxidation states Sb-O distances largely overlap (1.92-2.04   for Sb(III) and 1.98-\n\n2.10   for Sb(V)) [99]. \n\n \n\nThe same happens for Pb, with an electron configuration: [Xe] 4f\n14\n\n5d\n10\n\n6s\n2\n6p\n\n2\n and formal \n\nvalences of (+2) and (+4). The electron pair 6s\n2\n in Pb(II) induces the coordination asymmetry \n\nand the 5d\n10\n\n electrons in Pb(IV) will account for the energy perturbation [100]. It is of great \n\nimportance to raster these structural differences in order to provide answers about the raw \n\nmaterials used as well as hints for firing processes used. \n\n \n\n\n\n117 \n \n\nSample preparation: \n\n- A set of thirteen original samples from both production centers (Coimbra and Lisbon) was \n\ngathered. Six faience samples from the Museu Machado de Castro (MMC), in Coimbra, and five \n\nwall tile samples (originally produced in Lisbon) as well as two wall tile samples (originally \n\nproduced in Coimbra) from the Museu Nacional do Azulejo (MNAz), in Lisbon, were granted for \n\nnon-destructive analysis. The limited number of samples is due to the fact that yellow surface \n\ndecorations are quite \u2018rare\u2019 and difficult to find. \n\n- A set of reference lead- and antimony-based compounds were purchased from Kremer \n\nPigmente\u00a9: PbO (litharge); Pb2Sb2O7 (Naples yellow); Pb3(SbO4) (lead antimonate); Pb(SbSn)O3 \n\n(lead tin antimony from Paris). PbO2 (lead dioxide), Pb3O4 (lead tetroxide, Red lead) and PbCO3 \n\n(lead carbonate, White lead) were provided by BAM. Furthermore, XAFS spectra from several \n\nSb-based compounds were kindly provided by Andreas C. Scheinost (Beamline BM20 at the \n\nESRF, Grenoble, France): Sb2O5 Fluka, Sb2O3 (Senarmonite), Sb2O3 (Valentinite), Sb3O6(OH) \n\n(Stibiconite), SbSbO4 (Cervantite) and Sb2O5 synth [99].  \n\n- Aside from the list above, some replicas were produced at the Department of Arts, \n\nConservation &amp; Restoration from the Polytechnic Institute of Tomar (Portugal). The \n\nmanufacturing procedure for the replicas is described further in detail (cf. section 4.3, sub-\n\nsection 4.3.1.2 \u2013 Surface decoration: yellow). \n\n \n\nNote: Self-absorption (SA) effects were not taken into account in the following results. SA \n\neffects should be considered, especially when measuring in fluorescent mode (which is the \n\npresent case). Although one would expect different SA for standards and original samples, the \n\namount of Pb or Sb present in the latter reaches almost 40 % in most of the cases. This assigns \n\nthe samples with high-Z matrix and theoretically not much difference between SA-effects on \n\nstandards and originals should be expected. However, further investigations are in course, \n\nconsidering this aspect. The results here presented serve as comparative basis between \n\noxidations states and post-edge features between standards and unknown only. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n118 \n \n\nSb-K speciation: standards \n\nIn order to investigate the absorption behavior of Sb at the K-edge (30491 eV), the XAFS \n\nspectra were measured with a step width of 10 eV in the pre-edge region (from 30391 eV to \n\n30461 eV) and from there over the edge in 2 eV steps until 30595 eV. From 30595 eV until \n\n31488 eV in 220 equidistant steps in the k-space. All measurements were performed in \n\nfluorescence mode, as the samples are thick and have high-Z matrix. A Sb-foil was used to \n\ncalibrate the monochromator for the energy of the atomic Sb-K absorption edge, at 30491 eV. \n\nIn figures 4.33a and 4.33c, the XANES region for the Sb-K edge from all reference materials is \n\nplotted. Apart from Pb(SbSn)O3 compound, the white lines are broad and the oscillations on the \n\npost-edge region reveal that multiple scattering at low kinetic energies takes place. The \n\ntransition in the case of a K-edge (1s) occurs between s?p orbitals and the final state may have \n\nmixing with other orbitals (hybridization) that change the absorption profile.  \n\n \n\n\n\n119 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.33 \u2013 a) &amp; c) XANES spectra of Sb-based reference materials @ Sb-K edge. Differences in the \n\nedge positions as well as on the post-edge oscillations can be observed, owed to the contribution of \n\ndifferent electronic shells; b) &amp; d) Fourier transform of  (R) of experimental Sb-K edge EXAFS  (k)  for \n\ndifferent reference compounds. \n\n \n\nThe absorption features at the XANES region (figures 4.33a and 4.33c) reveal that the edge \n\nposition for cubic crystalline compounds with just one valence state (Sb2O5, Sb2O3 Fluka, \n\nPb2Sb2O7 and Pb3(SbO4)2) is at 30494 eV. Moreover, the absorption edge of compounds with \n\northorhombic crystalline structure (Cervantite, Stibiconite and Valentinite) is at 30496 eV. \n\nSenarmonite (a cubic crystalline phase of Sb2O3) assumes the lowest edge position at 30493 eV. \n\nXANES spectroscopy is extremely sensitive to the local coordination chemistry and the \n\ndifferences in the post-edge features suggest that the 4d\n10\n\n electrons in the SbV state are \n\nresponsible for these perturbations.  \n\n\n\n120 \n \n\nFigures 4.33b and 4.33d show the Fourier transform of  (R) of experimental Sb-K edge EXAFS \n\n (k) for the reference compounds. With EXAFS one is able to identify differences at other levels \n\n(environment of the probed atom), such as coordination and symmetry \u2013 that cannot be \n\nattained by the XANES region. Here, the peaks represent resonant frequencies \u2013 resulting from \n\nthe interference between the outgoing and the incoming scattered waves (cf. chapter 3, section \n\n3.4). The higher the amplitude of these peaks, the higher the coordination number (CN) and the \n\nstructural symmetry. From figures 4.33b and 4.33d, one can observe several differences \n\nbetween the EXAFS spectra of the Sb-reference compounds. First of all, differences arise \n\nbetween compounds with the same molecular formula but different crystalline structures \n\n(Valentinite and Senarmonite \u2013 figure 4.33b). This is owed mainly to symmetry issues: the cubic \n\narrangement reveals higher symmetry \u2013 higher amplitude \u2013 while the opposite happens for \n\northorhombic crystallographic arrangements.   \n\nLooking at figure 4.33d, a large difference between the Pb(SbSn)O3 and the rest exists. The \n\nsmall amplitude peaks from this compound reveal that there is a low CN \u2013 low number of \n\nneighbors \u2013 and also low symmetry. The first neighbor in all Sb-reference compounds is at \n\nabout 1.7   and it corresponds to the Sb-O1 path of interference. Then at about 2.8   another \n\nSb-O2 happens, which is just observable for the Pb2Sb2O7 compound. At about 3.4   and 3.8   \n\nthe interference paths Sb-Sb1 and Sb-Sb2 occur, which are observed for all compounds except \n\nPb(SbSn)O3. \n\n \n\nSb-K speciation: original samples \n\nXANES measurements were performed onto the yellow surface decorations from original \n\nsamples and in figure 4.34, a spectrum of each type of sample is plotted . \n\n \n\n\n\n121 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.34 \u2013 XANES spectra of some of the original samples @ Sb-K edge.  \n\n \n\nFrom figure 4.34 one sees that the edge position of all Sb-K XANES spectra is slightly shifted. \n\nFaiences from Coimbra reveal Sb-K edge @ 30494 eV, wall-tiles from Coimbra @ 30496 eV and \n\nwall-tiles from Lisbon @ 30493 eV. The post-edge features seem quite similar among all spectra \n\nfrom original samples but the shift in energy suggests differences in the crystalline structure. \n\nAccording to figures 4.33a and 4.33c, edges @ 30494 eV can represent different oxidations \n\nstates but a cubic crystalline structure is expected. If the edge is at 30496 eV an orthorhombic \n\ncrystallographic arrangement is present and the edge position at 30493 eV is in agreement with \n\nthe Sb(III) state in Senarmonite.  \n\nA linear combination fitting (LCF) procedure was performed for each spectrum with all the \n\nSb-reference compounds, in order to find similarities in the composition of the unknown \n\nspectra from the original samples. In figure 4.35 spectra from the three different types of \n\nsamples are shown together with the spectra obtained by LCF with standards. \n\n\n\n122 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.35 \u2013 Linear combination fitting (LCF) with Sb-reference compounds adjusted to the unknown \n\nXANES spectra of yellow of a) faiences from Coimbra, b) wall-tiles from Coimbra and c) wall-tiles from \n\nLisbon. (Note: the difference in height between original (black) and LCF (dashed-red) in c) is merely due \n\nto an exportation fault from ATHENA.) \n\n \n\nFrom figure 4.35 one realizes that Pb2Sb2O7 adjusts practically entirely to the features of the \n\nXANES spectra of all samples. However, the yellow from the samples from Lisbon (figure 4.35c) \n\nreveals a mixture of valences for Sb, where 58% adjusts to Pb2Sb2O7 and 33% to SbSbO4. It is \n\nimportant to realize that this process of LCF does not necessarily mean that, when a result of \n\n100% suitability with a certain compounds arises, the unknown spectrum corresponds exactly \n\nto that compound. For the edge position and post-edge features it is in good approximation a \n\nvalid result but one must (if possible) always confirm with the EXAFS region. \n\n\n\n123 \n \n\nFigure 4.36a shows the EXAFS spectra of each type of original samples: faiences from \n\nCoimbra and wall-tiles from Coimbra and Lisbon. Figures 4.36b, 4.36c and 4.36d show overlap \n\nbetween EXAFS spectra of each original sample and all the Sb-reference compounds. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.36 \u2013 Fourier transform of  (R) of experimental Sb-K edge EXAFS  (k) for different types of \n\noriginal samples: a) Faiences and Wall-tiles (Coimbra) and Wall-tiles (Lisbon); together with the \n\nreference compounds: b) Faiences from Coimbra, c) Wall-tiles from Coimbra, d) Wall-tiles form Lisbon. \n\n  \n\nFrom figure 4.36a one realizes clear differences between the EXAFS profiles of different \n\nsamples. For both faiences and wall-tiles from Coimbra, EXAFS signals adjust quite well to \n\nNaples Yellow (Pb2Sb2O7) and Cervantite (SbSbO4) compounds (figures 4.36b and 4.36c). The \n\nwall-tiles from Lisbon have shown further details, in which the shape of the frequencies seems \n\nto distinguish from any other Sb-compound (figure 4.36c). For example the first peak reveals an \n\n\n\n124 \n \n\noverlap of three different interference paths \u2013 by the presence of \u201cshoulders\u201d on the left- and \n\nright-side of the peak (at about 1.8  ). Furthermore, the succession of peaks around 3   does \n\nnot have a match with any of the Sb-reference compounds. Probably a mixture of other Sb-\n\nbased compounds exists and the available reference materials are not enough to testify this \n\nassumption.  \n\nBetween the different samples one can observe a higher symmetry and CN among the wall-\n\ntiles from Lisbon (figure 4.36a) \u2013 owed to the higher amplitude of the first peak.  Further \n\ninformation obtained by EXAFS is how far the closest neighbors from Sb are found at about \n\n1.5   and 3.5  .  \n\n \n\nThe next step was to verify if there are differences in the molecular structure on the yellow \n\npigment depending on the manufacturing process used. For this purpose replicas were \n\nmanufactured in laboratory according to procedure explained ahead in section 4.3, sub-section \n\n4.3.1.2. The pigment used was the so-called \u201cconventional\u201d Naples Yellow (Pb2Sb2O7). Figure \n\n4.37 shows XANES (a) and EXAFS (b) spectra for the three replicas together with the Pb2Sb2O7 in \n\npowder.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.37 \u2013 a) XANES and b) spectra of the three replicas together with the Pb2Sb2O7 in powder. \n\n \n\nWhether the pigment was applied mixed with water (P+H2O) or with glaze (P+G) or with \n\nglaze and submitted to a third firing stage (P+G+3\nrd\n\n F) does not affect the structural role of Sb \u2013 \n\n\n\n125 \n \n\nas one can observe by the strong resemblance between all spectra in the XANES region (figure \n\n4.37a) and EXAFS region (figure 4.37b). \n\n \n\nPb-L3 speciation: standards \n\nSince the yellow pigments are also Pb-based, a similar approach was also carried out for \n\nlead. The chemical speciation was performed at the Pb-L3 edge.  In figure 4.38a an overlap of \n\nthe XANES spectra collected for all the reference materials is presented in order to evaluate the \n\ndifferences in absorption.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.38 \u2013 a) XANES spectra of Pb-based reference materials @ Pb-L3 edge. Differences in the \n\nedge positions as well as on the post-edge oscillations can be observed, owed to the contribution of \n\ndifferent electronic shells; b) Fourier transform of  (R) of experimental Pb-L3 edge EXAFS  (k)  for \n\ndifferent reference compounds. \n\n \n\nAccording to what was already mentioned (at the beginning of this section) the electronic \n\nconfiguration of Pb allows formally the +2 and +4 valences. The atomic absorption edge for Pb-\n\nL3 is 13035 eV. According to the XANES spectra in figure 4.38a, the differences in the edge \n\nposition are not significant in comparison to the clear differences in the pre- and post-edge \n\ndetails. The edge positions range between 13040 \u2013 13041.5 eV for all compounds except for \n\nPb3O4 (13043.8 eV), owed to the fact that it comprised both Pb(II) and Pb(IV) oxidation states. \n\nThe energy perturbation of the 5d\n10\n\n electrons due to the chemical bonding in Pb(IV) induces \n\nintensity variations in the XANES post-edge [101]. \n\n\n\n126 \n \n\nIn contrast to the Sb-K EXAFS spectra, the Pb-L3 EXAFS region revealed huge differences in \n\nthe frequencies domain which can be observed in figure 4.39b. Comparing the EXAFS signals \n\nemerging from PbO massicot and litharge, the difference between the crystalline structures \n\n(orthorhombic and tetragonal) is translated in huge differences. The former shows higher CN \n\nnumber and symmetry (by the higher peaks), while the low-amplitude peaks in the latter \n\nindicate the opposite. In general, probing Pb-L3 at the EXAFS regions revealed a lower CN and \n\nsymmetry. \n\n \n\nPb-L3 speciation: original samples \n\nXANES measurements were performed on both glaze and yellow surfaces of each sample \n\nand, at first approach, a comparison between the two XANES spectra is made. Figure 4.39 \n\nshows spectra from Coimbra (faiences and wall-tiles) and from Lisbon samples (wall-tiles). \n\n \n\n\n\n127 \n \n\nFigure 4.39 \u2013 XANES spectra of some of the original samples @ Pb-L3 edge on both glaze (black) and \n\nyellow surfaces (orange) from faiences from Coimbra (a), wall-tiles from Coimbra (b) and wall-tiles from \n\nLisbon (c). \n\n \n\nIn all cases, a 1 eV difference between the edges of glaze and yellow spectra was identified \u2013 \n\nwith higher edge energy for the yellow spectra. The glazes have an absorption edge at 13040 eV \n\nand the yellows at 13041 eV \u2013 which represents a 5 eV shift for the former and 6 eV for the \n\nlatter in comparison to the atomic value (13035 eV). Most noticeable are the post-edge \n\ndifferences existing between glaze and yellow absorption spectra, where two maxima are \n\nobserved for the latter as well as opposite absorption coefficients for the energy range of \n\n13070 \u2013 13100 eV. \n\n \n\nA linear combination fitting (LCF) procedure was performed for each spectrum with all the \n\nPb-reference compounds, in order to find similarities in the composition of the unknown \n\nspectra from the original samples. In figure 4.40 spectra from the three different types of \n\nsamples (on glaze) are shown together with the spectra obtained by LCF with Pb-standards. \n\n\n\n128 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.40 \u2013 Linear combination fitting (LCF) with Pb-reference compounds adjusted to the \n\nunknown XANES spectra of glazes of a) faiences from Coimbra, b) wall-tiles from Coimbra and c) wall-\n\ntiles from Lisbon.  \n\n \n\nFrom figure 4.40 one realizes different contributions from different Pb-reference materials \n\nemerge for each type of sample. In glazes from faiences from Coimbra Pb3O4, PbO (massicot) \n\nand PbCO3 are the main compounds found with higher affinity from the LCF procedure (figure \n\n4.40a). In wall-tiles from Coimbra a contribution from Pb2Sb2O7 (with 28%, figure 4.40b) and in \n\nwall-tiles from Lisbon a contribution of the Pb(SbSn)O3 (with 38% - figure 4.40c) was found, \n\nboth significant, which could suggest a mixture of yellow to the glaze to look yellowish. PbO \n\n(litharge) is the main component in the glazes from wall-tiles from Coimbra (figure 4.40b) and \n\nthe second main in glazes from wall-tiles from Lisbon (figure 4.40c). The main conclusion from \n\nthese LCFs is that Pb coexists in several forms within the glazes, intentionally added by the \n\npotter. \n\n\n\n129 \n \n\nThe same treatment was performed for the yellow regions and spectra from the three \n\ndifferent types of samples (on glaze) are shown together with the spectra obtained by LCF with \n\nPb-standards (figure 4.41). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.41 \u2013 Linear combination fitting (LCF) with Pb-reference compounds adjusted to the \n\nunknown XANES spectra of yellow of a) faiences from Coimbra, b) wall-tiles from Coimbra and c) wall-\n\ntiles from Lisbon. \n\n \n\nFrom figure 4.41 one realizes that the results obtained from the LCF for Sb-K (cf. figure 4.35) \n\nare in agreement with these ones. In samples from Coimbra (faiences and wall-tiles) the yellow \n\npigment is mainly characterized by the Naples Yellow (Pb2Sb2O7) with percentages of 33% for \n\nfaiences (figure 4.41a) and 35% for wall-tiles (figure 4.41b). Furthermore, in faiences from \n\nCoimbra the form Pb(SbSn)O3 is the second most significant (with 22%), while for wall-tiles \n\nfrom Coimbra other Pb-based forms are the next most significant (19% Pb3O4 and 16 % PbCO3). \n\nThe yellows from Lisbon are different (as shown before for the Sb-K speciation), since the most \n\n\n\n130 \n \n\nsignificant compound is Pb(SbSn)O3 (with 48%), followed by Pb2(SbO4)2 (with 24% - figure \n\n4.41c). According to both Sb-K and Pb-L3 speciation Lisbon yellows revealed different \n\ncomposition, which suggests different manufacturing recipes and even different raw-materials \n\nused. \n\nAt last, EXAFS spectra were also acquired on both glaze and yellow from all samples and are \n\npresented below.  \n\n \n\n Figure 4.42 \u2013 Fourier transform of  (R) of experimental Pb-L3 edge EXAFS  (k) of the glazes of \n\ndifferent types of original samples: a) Faiences from Coimbra, b) Wall-tiles from Coimbra, c) Wall-tiles \n\nform Lisbon, all together with the two most compatible compounds (PbO litharge and massicot).  \n\n \n\nFrom figure 4.42 one sees a huge resemblance from the composition among the glazes from \n\nall samples. In the case of Pb-compounds, all glazes show high compatibility with the PbO \n\ncompounds in both arrangements (tetragonal in litharge and orthorhombic in massicot). \n\n\n\n131 \n \n\nHowever, the glazes in faiences from Coimbra show higher compatibility with PbO massicot \n\n(figure 4.42a), while wall-tiles from Coimbra show higher compatibility with PbO litharge (figure \n\n4.42b).  \n\nFurther EXAFS measurements were performed onto yellow decorated regions on the three \n\ntypes of samples and are plotted in figure 4.43. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.43 \u2013 Fourier transform of  (R) of experimental Pb-L3 edge EXAFS  (k) of the yellow regions \n\nfor different types of original samples: a) Faiences from Coimbra, b) Wall-tiles from Coimbra, c) Wall-\n\ntiles form Lisbon. \n\n \n\nBy evaluation of the EXAFS profiles, the results are in agreement with the LCF performed for \n\nthe XANES region (cf. figure 4.41).The yellow pigment on both faiences and wall-tiles from \n\nCoimbra are compatible with the Naples Yellow pigment (Pb2Sb2O7) (figures 4.43a and 4.43b), \n\nwhile the yellow pigment on wall-tiles from Lisbon showed practically no resemblance to the \n\n\n\n132 \n \n\nconventional Naples Yellow pigment. Instead a compatibility between the EXAFS profiles of two \n\nother Sb-compounds (Pb(SbSn)O3 and Pb2(SbO4)2) is found for the yellow in wall-tiles from \n\nLisbon (figure 4.43c). \n\n \n\n4.2.3.3 \u2013 Purple pigment \n\n \n\nX-ray Fluorescence \n\nAnalyses performed with conventional XRF showed similar chemical composition in all \n\npurple colors from both production centers (figure 4.44).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.44 \u2013 XRF spectra \u2013 obtained in conventional mode \u2013 from purple regions from faiences from \n\nCoimbra and wall-tiles from Coimbra and Lisbon. \n\n \n\nThe dominant element that confers the purple color is Manganese (Mn), and the presence of \n\nBarium (Ba) in the spectra indicates that the mineral Psilomelane [(Ba,H2O)2Mn5O10] may have \n\nbeen used as source of Mn. It is known that in Portugal (specifically in the Alentejo region) \n\nPsilomelane is quite abundant and this means that the source for Manganese may be local \n\n[102]. \n\n\n\n133 \n \n\nIn order to evaluate the consistence of the presence of Barium connected to Manganese, net \n\ncounts for these elements was taken into account and compared between faiences and wall-\n\ntiles (from Coimbra and Lisbon) (figure 4.45). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.45 \u2013 Plot of the elemental net counts for Mn, Fe and Ba for faiences from Coimbra (Coimbra \n\nF), wall-tiles from Coimbra (Coimbra T) and wall-tiles from Lisbon (Lisbon T); b) comparison of elemental \n\nratios (Fe/Mn, Ba/Mn) between faiences from Coimbra (Coimbra F), wall-tiles from Coimbra (Coimbra T) \n\nand wall-tiles from Lisbon (Lisbon T). \n\n \n\nFrom figure 4.45a one sees that the wall-tiles (Coimbra T and Lisbon T) show higher count \n\nrates for Ba-L lines and in comparison to the faiences (Coimbra F). This is proved by the ratio \n\nplot in figure 4.45b, where an increase of the Ba/Mn (light-purple line) is observed (right hand-\n\nside of the grey dashed line). The ratio Fe/Mn (orange line) keeps more or less unchanged \n\nbetween faiences and wall-tiles. \n\nIn order to check the elemental distribution in depth, specifically the pigment dissemination \n\nthroughout the glaze, high-resolved Micro-XRF scans on the cross-section were carried out.   \n\n\n\n134 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.46 \u2013 Cross-section scans performed through purple/glaze/body of a) a faience from \n\nCoimbra, b) a wall-tile from Coimbra, and c) a wall-tile from Lisbon [39]. \n\n \n\nIn figure 4.46 the elemental profiles of samples containing purple decorative motifs are \n\ncompared. Cross-section scans were performed through purple/glaze/body from a faience from \n\nCoimbra (figure 4.46a) a wall-tile from Coimbra (figure 4.46b) and a wall-tile from Lisbon (figure \n\n4.46c). \n\nAgain, in the pictures taken with the microscope it is indicated how the scans were \n\nperformed. The scans compare the Mn-K, Pb-L and Fe-K signals, which characterize purple, \n\nglaze and body, respectively. Once again one can see that the faience sample (figure 4.46a) \n\nreveals no interface between color/glaze. The glaze thickness is approximately 150 \u00b5m and the \n\npigment was applied to the glaze and both have been submitted to one firing stage. There is, \n\nhowever, a moderate connection between glaze and body in this sample, to observe by the \n\n\n\n135 \n \n\nsmoothly decreasing and increasing of the Pb and Fe profiles, respectively. Comparing the tiles \n\nfrom Coimbra and Lisbon it is to see that the pigment (Mn) is equally well dispersed through \n\nthe glaze in both samples (figures 4.46b and 4.46c). However, the Mn profile in the sample \n\nfrom Coimbra (figure 4.46b) reveals a broader maximum at the surface (~50 \u00b5m) than in the \n\nsample from Lisbon (&lt;25 \u00b5m \u2013 figure 4.46c). The Copper (Cu) signal was also plotted because \n\nthe purple motifs were applied together with a green colored layer (observable on the picture). \n\nThe glazes from both tiles have thicknesses of about 250 and 300 \u00b5m for the Coimbra and \n\nLisbon cases, respectively. Again one observes a smoother elemental exchange at the interface \n\nglaze/body in the sample from Lisbon (figure 4.46c) than in the sample from Coimbra (figure \n\n4.46b). \n\n \n\nScanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry (SEM/EDX) \n\nAt this point, knowledge about the morphological properties of this pigment is also a \n\nrequirement in order to complement and support the data so far presented. Hence, SEM/EDX \n\nanalyses were performed on the purple areas of some samples (from both production centers).  \n\nAgain, it is important to emphasize the heterogeneity among these objects. Therefore, \n\nquantitative results obtained with EDX will be here presented just as an estimation of the \n\ncontent at a specific area. Hence, these will not be considered as providing representative \n\nquantitative information of the whole piece/area.  \n\nEDX results were obtained by wide-area analyses onto the purple surfaces (figure 4.47 and \n\ntable 4.8). \n\n \n\n\n\n136 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.47 \u2013 SEM micrographs taken on the purple surface of a faience from Coimbra (a) and a wall-\n\ntile from Lisbon (b). \n\n \n\nTable 4.8 \u2013 Elemental composition of the purple regions of the samples (N is the number of samples \n\nanalyzed) from Coimbra and Lisbon (in wt-%) obtained with standardless EDX (wide-area).

Particularly Pb which is much higher in \n\nfaiences (ca. 30 wt%) than in wall-tiles (ca. 10 wt%). Furthermore, for the analyzed the amount \n\nof Mn is lower in faiences (ca. 10 wt%) than in wall-tiles (ca. 20 wt%). High magnification \n\nanalyses have revealed that the crystals in the purple layer could be observed from both \n\ncenters of production (figure 4.48). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n138 \n \n\n4.2.3.4 \u2013 Green pigment \n\n \n\nX-ray Fluorescence \n\nGreen was found to be rather scarce as color used for decoration purposes, among this type \n\nof objects. Within all analyzed samples, green was found in 2 faiences, 2 wall-tiles from Coimbra \n\nand 3 wall-tiles from Lisbon. Analyses performed with conventional XRF showed similar \n\nchemical composition in all green colors from both production centers, except for one wall-tile \n\nfrom Lisbon (figure 4.49).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.49 \u2013 XRF spectra \u2013 obtained in conventional mode \u2013 from green regions from faiences from \n\nCoimbra and wall-tiles from Coimbra and Lisbon. \n\n \n\nFirst of all the difference in the shape of the background between the spectrum of the \n\nfaience (green) and the spectra from both wall-tiles (grey and black) is due to the fact that the \n\nformer was obtained by means of a polycapillary lens and the latter by means of a collimator. \n\nThis choice was due to the fact that the green areas in the faiences from Coimbra were much \n\nsmaller than in the ones from the wall-tiles (figure 4.49), and in order to avoid overlap of \n\ninformation from adjacent areas, the polycapillary was more suitable.  \n\n\n\n139 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.50 \u2013 Samples in which green was found for the decoration: a) faience from Coimbra (green \n\nstripes with ca. 1 mm thickness), b) wall-tile from Coimbra, c) wall-tiles from Lisbon (two different hues).  \n\n \n\nOne can see \u2013 from figure 4.49 \u2013 that the dominant element is Copper (Cu). However, for \n\none the wall-tiles from Lisbon the green hue is obtained by an intentional mixture between \n\nblue (Co-Ni-As) and yellow (Sb), seen in the light green spectrum in figure 4.49. This spectrum \n\ncorresponds to the sample AZLX6, exhibited in figure 4.50c (right-hand side) and in fact a \n\nparticular green hue is noticeable, when observing the other green hues from the other \n\nsamples in the same figure. \n\nIn order to evaluate the consistence of the presence of Copper within the green decorated \n\nregions, net counts for these elements used and compared between faiences and wall-tiles \n\n(from Coimbra and Lisbon) (figure 4.51). \n\n \n\n\n\n140 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.51 \u2013 Plot of the elemental net counts for Mn, Fe, Co, Cu and Sb, for faiences from Coimbra \n\n(Coimbra F), wall-tiles from Coimbra (Coimbra T) and wall-tiles from Lisbon (Lisbon T); b) comparison \n\nelemental ratios (Mn/Cu, Fe/Cu, Co/Cu and Sb/Cu) between faiences from Coimbra (Coimbra F), wall-\n\ntiles from Coimbra (Coimbra T) and wall-tiles from Lisbon (Lisbon T). \n\n \n\nFrom figure 4.51a one sees that in faiences and wall-tiles from Coimbra (Coimbra F and \n\nCoimbra T) the green color is due to a Cu-based pigment, while in wall-tiles from Lisbon (Lisbon \n\nT) the color green emerges from the mixture of a Co-based pigment (blue) and a Sb-based \n\npigment (yellow). This is confirmed by the ratios plot in figure 4.51b. The Mn/Cu, Fe/Cu and \n\nCo/Cu ratio is relatively low in faience and wall-tiles from Coimbra (Coimbra F and Coimbra T), \n\nwhich means that Copper is the key-element for the green color. Conversely, the same ratios \n\nare relatively high in wall-tiles from Lisbon (Lisbon T), together with the Sb/Cu ratio, which \n\nindicated that the green color is mainly due to the overlap of blue and yellow. \n\nIn order to check the elemental distribution in depth, specifically the pigment dissemination \n\nthroughout the glaze, high-resolved Micro-XRF scans on the cross-section were carried out [39].   \n\n\n\n141 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.52 \u2013 Cross-section scans performed through green/glaze/body of a) a wall-tile from \n\nCoimbra, and b) a wall-tile from Lisbon [39]. \n\n \n\nCross-section scans were performed through the green/glaze/body of a wall-tile from \n\nCoimbra (figure 4.52a), and a wall-tile from Lisbon (figure 4.52b). Evaluating the Cu-signal, the \n\nintake of pigment into the glaze seems to be higher in the sample from Lisbon than in the \n\nsample from Coimbra. However, a broader maximum of the Cu-signal at the surface from the \n\nsample from Coimbra (ca. 50 \u00b5m \u2013 figure 4.52a) than in the sample from Lisbon (ca. 25 \u00b5m \u2013 \n\nfigure 4.52b) is observed [39]. Also, the elemental exchange between the glaze and the body \n\nseems to be more pronounced in the sample from Lisbon than in the sample from Coimbra. The \n\njustification is the same as previously explained (cf. 4.2.3.3 \u2013 Purple). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n142 \n \n\n4.3 \u2013 Replicas \n\nOne of the goals of this investigation was trying to carry out a non-destructive approach, as \n\none is dealing with CH-related objects. The samples used for this work are fragments \u2013 and \n\nthere is quite considerable available amount of such fragments in Portugal \u2013 so, some of these \n\nobjects could undergo minor physical invasion. For example, an application of Carbon-layer to \n\nperform SEM measurements and also a small amount of ceramic body removal was allowed in \n\norder to perform XRD analyses. The ceramic body is not so crucial to keep intact, as it is quite \n\neasy to remove part of it while keeping the integrity of the whole piece.  \n\nFor all these \u201cdifficulties\u201d the need of recreating analogues to the original samples became \n\nnecessary in order to understand some features obtained by the experimental analyses.   \n\nAll replicas were produced by Ricardo Tri\u00e3es from the Department of Arts, Conservation &amp; \n\nRestoration from the Polytechnic Institute of Tomar (Portugal). \n\n \n\n4.3.1 \u2013 Manufacturing processes \n\n \n\n4.3.1.1 \u2013 Glaze \n\nIt is important to know the mineralogical features of glazes and possibly to estimate the \n\nfiring temperature to which they were submitted. For this purpose, three different types of \n\nglazed surfaces were produced. Using these glazes \u2013 with known chemical and mineralogical \n\ncomposition \u2013 one can observe the phase differences and mineralogical changes after each \n\nthermal transformation. Following the identification of the mineralogical changes in the \n\nprepared samples, one can correlate the obtained results for the original glazes, allowing \n\nestimating the production firing temperature [36]. The manufacturing procedure is explained in \n\nthe following steps, with the help of figure 4.53: \n\n \n\n\n\n143 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.53 \u2013 Manufacturing procedure for the glazed surfaces. \n\n \n\n1) Industrial ceramic support was used as base; \n\n2) Three different glazes (frit) \u2013 in powder \u2013 were used. Glaze A and B are two types \n\nof ancient glaze (XVII century) and Glaze C is a rustic glaze (figure 4.53a);  \n\n3) Each powder was diluted in water on a proportion of 1:3 (figure 4.53b); \n\n4) The ceramic support was then submersed for 5 seconds in the glaze (figure \n\n4.53c).  \n\n5) The pieces were put to \u201crest\u201d just shortly in order for them to dry (figure 4.53d); \n\nthey were marked with a designation which corresponds to the type of glaze (A, B or C) \n\nand to the temperature to which they were submitted (8 \u2013 800 ?C, 9 \u2013 900 ?C and 10 \u2013 \n\n1000 ?C). A total of four pieces were prepared for each glaze and temperature. \n\n6) Al last they were placed in the oven (figure 4.53e) and the firing sequence was \n\nthe following:  \n\ni. 15 min. until 110 ?C; \n\n\n\n144 \n \n\nii. 15 min. at the 110 ?C stage; \n\niii. 90 min. until 550 ?C; \n\niv. 30 min. until 600 ? C; \n\nv. 90 min. until maximum temperature (800, 900 or 1000 ?C) \n\n7) After the pieces are fired, the oven has to cool down to a temperature below \n\n100 ?C in order to open it. \n\nIn figure 4.54 a picture of how the pieces look like after fired is presented. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.54 \u2013 Three different types of glazes (A, B and C) submitted to three different firing \n\ntemperatures (800 ?C, 900 ?C and 1000 ?C) [36]. \n\n \n\nFrom figure 4.54 some aspects are noticeable by naked-eye observation. Features like color, \n\nbrightness and integrity are obviously susceptible to changes according to the chemical \n\ncomposition and firing temperature used. Glaze A (figure 4.54a) has a mate appearance and it \n\nhas experienced a change in the hue for higher firing temperature (from pinkish to grayish). \n\nMoreover, it has kept its integrity and smoothness under different firing temperatures. Glaze B \n\n(figure 4.54b) has a shiny appearance and the color has changed from yellow to light-yellow \n\n(from 800 ?C to 1000 ?C); plus, it has kept its integrity under different firing temperatures but it \n\n\n\n145 \n \n\nshows a certain surface roughness with increasing temperature. Glaze C (figure 4.54c) has a \n\nshiny appearance as well and it has not changed its color. However, it has not kept its integrity \n\nwith increasing firing temperatures: at 900 ?C it has began to crack and for 1000 ?C one sees \n\nquite high amount of holes in the glaze surface. \n\nAll these differences were mainly due to the glaze composition. Glaze A is more similar in \n\ncomposition to the ones used at the time the original pieces were manufactures, and one sees \n\nit kept intact even when submitted to 1000 ?C. Glaze C is more modern and therefore, has less \n\nlead content which promotes the loss of integrity under \u201cextreme\u201d firing conditions. \n\n  \n\n4.3.1.2 \u2013 Surface decoration \u2013 yellow \n\nFurther replicas were prepared in laboratory in order to understand how the decorative \n\nmotifs were applied to the glaze. This was especially investigated for the yellow pigments. As \n\nshown before, this pigment is a combination of Sb and Pb and it forms a quite compact \u201clayer\u201d \n\non the upper part without much diffusion throughout the glaze (cf. sub-section 4.2.3.2 \u2013 \n\nyellow). In order to better evaluate whether the pigment was applied over the base glaze and \n\nthe whole piece was submitted to a third firing stage (for the surface decoration), replicas with \n\nvariable parameters were produced in laboratory.  \n\nThe manufacturing procedure of these replicas is explained in the following steps: \n\n1) Industrial ceramic support was used as base; \n\n2) Glaze A (ancient-like, XVII century) was used and applied in the same way as \n\ndescribed above, for the previous replicas (figure 4.53); \n\n3) Naples Yellow (Pb2Sb2O7) \u2013 NY \u2013 purchased at the Kremer Pigmente\u00a9 was used \n\nin all the variations of manufacture: \n\na.  NY mixed with water and applied onto the base glaze \u2013 both fired at the \n\nsame time; \n\nb. NY mixed with water and applied onto the previously fired base glaze \u2013 \n\nthird firing stage for the whole piece (which means, own firing stage for \n\nNY+water mixture); \n\n\n\n146 \n \n\nc. NY mixed with glaze and applied onto the previously fired base glaze \u2013 \n\nthird firing stage for the whole piece (which means, own firing stage for the \n\nNY+glaze mixture). \n\nAll replicas were then cut along the painted areas in order to have polished cross-sections \n\nhaving color/base glaze/body. \n\n \n\n4.3.2 \u2013 Chemical and mineralogical characterization \n\n \n\n4.3.2.1 \u2013 Glaze \n\nThe use of raw glazes on traditionally fired products is a well-established practice. However, \n\ndocumental facts of the ceramic production in Coimbra report both raw and fritted applications \n\non the bisque [9]. During the firing process of raw glazes, different processes can occur, such as: \n\ndecomposition of raw materials, chemical reactions giving either crystalline or glassy products, \n\nand melting followed by nucleation and crystallization of the melt [103]. The glazes used for the \n\nreplicas are commercially obtained frits. \n\nXRF analyses on each type of glaze were performed and in figure 4.55 the respective spectra \n\nare shown. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.55 \u2013 XRF spectra of the three types of glaze used for the replicas. \n\n\n\n147 \n \n\n \n\nFrom figure 4.55, differences between the glazes elemental variability are observed. Glaze A \n\ncorresponds to a more ancient type and Glaze C corresponds to a rustic modern one. This \n\ndifference is mainly realized by the much lower count rate for Pb-lines in Glaze C, when \n\ncompared with Glaze A. This decrease is Pb must be compensated by another flux agent, which \n\nin this case is Zirconium (Zr) \u2013 with higher contribution \u2013 and Titanium (Ti) \u2013 with lower \n\ncontribution, to obtain similar glaze properties. \n\nGlaze B \u2013 assuming an intermediary-age position between Glaze A and C \u2013 shows lower Pb \n\nand higher Zn concentration, when compared with Glaze A. \n\nIt is known that Pb is an excellent flux-acting agent in the glassy matrix conferring properties \n\nthat no other element can offer (cf. chapter 1, section 1.2.2). However, it has a huge drawback: \n\nit is highly toxic. Therefore, the use of other fluxes in the glazes became necessary. \n\nAfter submitting all three types of glaze to the above firing conditions \u2013 for three different \n\ntemperatures \u2013 XRF analyses were performed on the three pieces and for the three different \n\ntemperatures, ten points were studied. The obtained results are displayed in figure 4.56 and \n\ncorrespond to an average of all measurements.  \n\n \n\n\n\n148 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.56 \u2013 Net counts plot of the elements that compose the three glazes for three different firing \n\ntemperatures: 800, 900 and 1000 ?C [36]. \n\n \n\nAs expected, no elemental changes occured for the three glazes having different firing \n\ntemperatures. More interesting is to observe whether there are or not changes in the \n\nmineralogical composition depending on the firing temperature used. For this purpose, XRD \n\nanalyses were carried out and tables 4.9, 4.10 and 4.11 exhibit the mineralogical content of \n\nGlazes A, B, C, respectively for the three firing temperatures used together with the mineralogy \n\nof the glaze in powder before applied to the ceramic body.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n149 \n \n\nTable 4.9 \u2013 Mineralogical firing temperature dependence obtained by XRD for the glaze A, submitted \n\nto 800 ?C, 900 ?C and 1000 ?C, respectively. \n\nCompound \n\n---------- \n\nFiring \n\ntemp.

The simulation of old-\n\nlike glazes production is performed by introducing Quartz and clay minerals to the frit, as it is \n\nexhibited in the XRD profile of glazes A and B. Moreover, in glazes A and B, kaolinite becomes \n\namorphous at 550 \u00b0C and vanishes after the firing process is finished and at 1000 \u00b0C the \n\nchanges are basically due to mineral orientation, rather than thermal modifications (Tables 4.9 \n\nand 4.10). Additional important aspects are the fact that Glaze A exhibits more Kaolinite and \n\nIllite than the other two and after the firing process is finished, it reveals a more matte \n\nappearance than glaze C (figure 4.54). Glaze C is mainly composed by zircon (ZrSiO4), which \n\nassigns it as a modern one. In its profile is also shown a peak of Cristobalite, characteristic from \n\na high-temperature polymorph of Quartz\u2014this means that is has the same chemistry as Quartz \n\nbut a different structure (Table 4.11). Some of the compounds are only formed after the glaze \n\nreaches the so called \u201cworking point\u201d. This is the stage where all components have melted and \n\nthis liquid matrix state of the glaze originates the formation of some mineralogical components \n\nsuch as Skuterrudite (CoAs3), Anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8) and sodium aluminium-trisilicate \n\n(NaAlSi3O8). Furthermore, Cassiterite (SnO2) crystallizes from 800 \u00b0C. Depending on the amount \n\nand on the original components from the raw frit, the \u201cworking point\u201d can be reached at \n\n\n\n151 \n \n\ndifferent temperatures for each kind of glaze [104].  Another interesting fact is that \n\nSkuterrudite appears only due to the initial presence of cobalt oxide in the raw frit. This \n\ncompound causes an interesting optic effect on the glaze and it was commonly used to confer \n\nsome bluish-hue to the glaze in order to reduce the typical commercial yellowish nature from \n\nthe glazes. From an esthetical point of view, in general people tended to prefer the less \n\nyellowish glazes. One can even prove this fact by observation of the three different glazes \n\napplied on the ceramic pieces (figure 4.54), where glaze A is less yellow than the other two. \n\n \n\n4.4 \u2013 In situ analysis of whole Museum objects \n\nA set of forty-seven (47) glazed ceramic objects \u2013 faiences \u2013, originally produced in Coimbra \n\n(Portugal), were submitted to elemental analysis, having as premise the manufacture \n\nproduction recognition. According to the literature [9] these objects are marked with the \n\npotters labels and a correct date assignation was possible. Objects from the XVII, XVIII and XIX \n\ncenturies were analyzed. \n\nAlthough having been produced in Coimbra, their location changed as time passed due to \n\nhistorical reasons. An exhibition celebrating the glazed ceramics production in Coimbra took \n\nplace at the Museu Machado de Castro (Coimbra) in 2008, and shortly after \u2013 before the \n\nobjects were deported to their current locations \u2013 in situ XRF analyses were able to be carried \n\nout. Annex 1.4 resumes a description of all analyzed objects and figure 4.58 an example of \n\nsome objects. \n\nWith the aim of tracing differences between objects from different centuries, Micro-XRF \n\nanalyses on whole Museum ceramic objects were performed. Of course the only viable \n\nmethods of analyses are in situ and therefore information on the elemental level only was \n\npossible.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n152 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.57 \u2013 Examples of faiences from Coimbra: (a) polychrome piece \u201cPrato Vascomselos\u201d: 6\u00d7\u00d827 \n\ncm (b) the use of purples in \u201cPrato Mulher P\u00e1ssaro\u201d: 4.8\u00d7\u00d827.4 cm; (c) plate: decorative motives used in \n\nthese pieces only in blue, such as laces (marked in the picture), typical from Coimbra \u201cPrato Fl\u00f4r\u201d: \n\n5.3\u00d7\u00d833.6 cm; (d) Micro-XRF in situ analysis of a barrel (\u201cPote\u201d) from Coimbra: 14.5\u00d724\u00d7\u00d815 cm [9, 38]. \n\n \n\n4.4.1 \u2013 Blue pigment \n\nThe XRF spectra of the blue regions in all objects were deconvoluted, fitted and the net peak \n\nareas of the characteristic elements were considered for comparison between the different \n\ndates. In figure 4.58 net peak areas for Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, As and Bi are presented, together with \n\nthe ratios Mn/Co, Fe/Co, Ni/Co and Bi/As.  \n\n \n\n\n\n153 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.58 \u2013 a) Plot of the elemental net counts of Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, As, Bi for faiences from Coimbra \n\nfrom the XVII, XVIII and XIX centuries; b) comparison elemental ratios (Mn/Co, Fe/Co, Ni/Co, Bi/Co) of \n\nfaiences from Coimbra from the XVII, XVIII and XIX centuries; c) As/Ni square-root net counts ratio \n\nplotted against Co/Fe square-root net counts ratio, for faiences objects (Coimbra). \n\n \n\nFrom figure 4.58a one sees that there is no significant elemental variability between objects \n\nfrom the XVII, XVIII and XIX. This is also confirmed by the ratios depicted in figure 4.58b. \n\nBismuth has a week presence among the blue in faiences from Coimbra (also previously \n\nconfirmed by the plots in figure 4.17 for the fragments). Although the ratio changes are more or \n\nless stable Ni/Co and Bi/Co have the lowest change among all objects, while Fe/Co and Ni/Co \n\nshow sharper changes \u2013 though in a small scale (? 0.5). Furthermore \u2013 as already mentioned \n\nbefore (cf. figure 4.17) \u2013 there is no significant difference between objects from the XVII, XVIII \n\nand XIX centuries regarding the contaminant association to the Co-ore. In figure 4.58c the As/Ni \n\nratio against Co/Fe ratio is plotted and one sees no distinguished groups for the different \n\n\n\n154 \n \n\nproduction dates. One could assume a possible separation for the objects from the XIX century \n\nin terms of Co-purity, as two of the samples reveal higher values for Co.  \n\nIn addition, Spearman correlation test was performed and table 4.12 shows the correlation \n\ncoefficients between the elements that characterize the blue of faiences from Coimbra. \n\n \n\nTable 4.12 \u2013 Spearman correlation coefficient (?) for net peak areas of the elements that most \n\ncharacterize the blue in faiences from Coimbra \u2013 museum objects (N = 37). \u00b4**\u00b4 indicates that the \n\ncorrelations are significant at the p<0.01 level; \u00b4*\u00b4 indicates that the correlations are significant at the \n\np<0.05 level. \n\n Mn Fe Co Ni As Bi \n\n \n\nMn \n?  .337* .134 .178 .264 .059 \n\nSig.

Co-Fe, Co-Ni Co-As and Co-Bi show a positive significant \n\ncorrelation at the p<0.01 level.  \n\nTaking all the above into account, no significant differences are observed with respect to the \n\nsource of Co for the blue. There is definitely a connection to the five element vein related to Co \n\nitself (Fe-Co-Ni-As-Bi), as it was previously identified.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n155 \n \n\n4.4.2 \u2013 Yellow pigment \n\nXRF measurements on the yellow regions revealed the presence of Sb together with strong \n\npeaks of Pb, which is in agreement with the use of Naples Yellow pigment \u2013 as previously \n\nexplained.  \n\nAlthough Pb is connected to the structure of the yellow pigment, conventional in situ Micro-\n\nXRF measurements carry the uncertainty from how deep the fluorescent signal comes and \n\ntherefore, one cannot estimate whether Pb is owed to the yellow \u201clayer\u201d only or to the base \n\nglaze as well. The same is valid for Sn \u2013 which is possible to be part of the crystal structure as \n\nwell (cf. 4.2.3.2 \u2013 Yellow). However, the ratios of the elements that mostly characterize the \n\nyellow pigment are displayed in figure 4.59. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.59 \u2013 a) Plot of the elemental net counts of Mn, Fe, Zn, Sn, Sb and Pb of yellow regions of \n\nfaiences from Coimbra from the XVII, XVIII and XIX centuries; b) comparison elemental ratios (Mn/Sb, \n\nFe/Sb, Zn/Sb and Sn/Sb) of faiences from Coimbra from the XVII, XVIII and XIX centuries. \n\n \n\nOther hues such as orange-like and brownish were also analyzed and in these cases the \n\nobtained spectra show mainly Mn and Fe. This suggests the use of ochres of these elements \n\nmixed with Naples yellow. These results are in agreement with the documented hypothesis that \n\nmanganese oxides and iron oxides and hydroxides were responsible for the orange and brown \n\ncolors [38]. From figure 4.59b one sees for example a decrease in the Fe/Sb and Zn/Sb from the \n\nXVII to the XIX centuries, which indicates a less use of other ochres in the yellow regions in the \n\nmore recent objects. \n\n\n\n156 \n \n\n \n\n4.4.3 \u2013 Purple pigment \n\nAs previously described (cf. 4.2.3.3 \u2013 Purple), Mn is the dominant element for conferring the \n\npurple hue. The source of Mn is highly probable to be Portuguese as the mineral Psilomelane \n\n[(Ba,H2O)2Mn5O10] is quite abundant in the country [102]. Once again the connection between \n\nMn and Ba is observed for known faiences from Coimbra. In figure 4.60 the ratios of the \n\ncharacteristic elements conferring this hue is presented as well as the Fe/Mn and Ba/Mn ratios. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.60 \u2013 Plot of the elemental net counts for Mn, Fe and Ba for faiences from Coimbra; b) \n\ncomparison of elemental ratios (Fe/Mn, Ba/Mn). \n\n \n\nFrom figure 4.60a one realizes little change in the Mn net counts. The possible changes are \n\ndue to a denser painted area, in which more pigment was used. Observing the ratios in figure \n\n4.60b a very constant Ba/Mn relationship is kept which indicates a strong association between \n\nMn and Ba \u2013 this was also observed for the analyzed purple regions in faience fragments (cf. \n\nfigure 4.45). Fe \u2013 although constant in all spectra \u2013 seems to have little participation in the \n\npurple color, as there is not a strong association between Mn and Fe (figure 4.60b). \n\nThe ceramic production in Coimbra is also distinguished by another feature, which is the fine \n\nand detailed contours between the painted areas, usually in purple. In figure 4.61 one can \n\nobserve that the contours are more dense colored areas and this is evidenced by the increase in \n\nMn and the decrease of Pb (characteristic from the glaze), due to a thicker layer of purple color \n\n[38]. \n\n\n\n157 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.61 \u2013 Left-hand side: Faience from Coimbra \u201cPrato\u201d with two marked regions (yellow) \n\nenhancing purple contour and painted area; right-hand side: XRF spectra correspondent to purple \n\ncontour and painted area, respectively [38]. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.4.4 \u2013 Green pigment \n\nAccording to the literature, green was just started to appear as decoration in faiences from \n\nmid. XVIII century [9]. Moreover it was not a very common color to find in such applications. It \n\nhas been seen before (cf. 4.2.3.4 \u2013 Green), that differences in the green pigments from faiences \n\nand wall-tiles exist. In faiences the pigment used is Cu-based while in wall-tiles from Lisbon a \n\nmixture between blue and yellow was made in order to obtain the desired green hue. In this \n\ncase, no original green pigment was used. \n\nIn figure 4.62 ROIs of the possible green-conferring elements are presented as well as useful \n\nratios for the case. \n\n \n\n\n\n158 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.62 \u2013 Plot of the elemental net counts for Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn and Sb of green regions of \n\nfaiences from Coimbra; b) comparison of elemental ratios (Co/Cu, Sb/Cu). \n\n \n\nA difference between the elemental recognition in green regions is observed between \n\nobjects from the XVIII and XIX centuries. Clearly, the ones from the XVIII century are Cu-based \u2013 \n\nwith little contribution of blue or yellow components\u2013 while the ones from the XIX century \n\nreveal higher contribution of blue and yellow elements (figure 4.62a). The Co/Cu and Sb/Cu \n\nratios are relatively low for the XVIII objects (left-hand side from the dashed-grey line in figure \n\n4.62b), justified by the higher count rates of Cu. On the other hand these ratios are rather \n\nunstable for objects from the XIX century (right-hand side from the dashed-grey line in figure \n\n4.62b), which means that Cu is no longer the only color-giving element but rather a mixture \n\nbetween blue (Co) and yellow (Sb).  \n\nThese results are in agreement with the ones obtained for the faience fragment (cf. figure \n\n4.51), which indicated that the whole analyzed fragments belong to the period until the XVIII \n\ncentury.  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n159 \n \n\nCHAPTER 5 \u2013 DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS and OUTLOOK \n\nIn this chapter a discussion about the results presented in the previous chapter is made. \n\nGeneral features obtained by various analytical methods are summarized and conclusions are \n\nwithdrawn. Differences between Coimbra and Lisbon arose, regarding the ceramic body, glaze, \n\nblue and yellow regions. The discussion is, therefore, presented according to this division. \n\nAt the end perspectives for future work are presented. \n\n \n\n5.1 Ceramic body  \n\nInformation obtained by XRF has shown that elemental variability is less for faiences than for \n\nwall-tiles. This is in agreement with the manufacturing process behind faiences and wall-tiles. \n\nFaiences are formed using potter\u00b4s wheel \u2013 which confers higher uniformity among the raw-\n\nmaterials \u2013 while wall-tiles are made in plaques (which induce a higher material heterogeneity). \n\nTogether with the results obtained by XRD, wall-tiles from Lisbon revealed several Ca-based \n\ncompounds \u2013 which justify the higher Ca count rate from XRF data. Conversely, faience samples \n\nrevealed two types of feldspars (Microcline and Anorthite), while wall-tiles (both from Coimbra \n\nand Lisbon) have revealed just K-rich feldspars (Microcline). Although they are both feldspars, \n\nthere are some differences between the presence of Microcline and Anorthite in the pastes. \n\nMicrocline belongs to the raw materials, while Anorthite is a mineral that emerges from a \n\nthermal transformation. \n\nGehlenite is found mainly in wall-tiles, from Coimbra and Lisbon, being Fe its main element \n\nand it is mostly used in wall-tiles, as it confers a darker-reddish hue to the body. This is not \n\ndesired in faiences \u2013 where whitish pastes are required.  \n\nFurthermore, the presence of Cristobalite in the samples from Coimbra and not in the \n\nsamples from Lisbon is a hint of different cooling processes used for the ceramic support. The \n\nones from Coimbra have undergone rapid cooling processes, allowing keeping phases such as \n\nCristobalite in the structure, as well as thermal tensions which lead to a more fragile body. \n\nThe presence of Pb in all spectra from the body has to do with a capillarity effect that occurs \n\nduring the drying process. According to [105], lead is water-soluble and when applied over the \n\n\n\n160 \n \n\nceramic body \u2013 together with other glaze components \u2013 the solution penetrates into the \n\nporous body allowing lead migration until the bottom of the body, favored by its high porosity. \n\nThis effect happens for both types of samples, being more pronounced in wall-tiles from Lisbon \n\ndue to their higher porosity in comparison with faiences (Coimbra). \n\n \n\n5.2 Glaze \n\nGlazes in all samples are characterized by similar compound-groups: network-forming agent \n\n(Silica), network-modifiers or fluxes (Pb, Zn, Ca, K, Na) and opacifiers (Sn, Ti). Further coloring \n\nagents were added to the glaze (Mn, Fe, Cu). However the strong presence of Pb and Sn confers \n\nthe designation lead-tin-based glazes. The addition of Pb was a very important step in glazes \n\nmanufacture, as it lowers the melting point of the whole glassy structure and therefore it can \n\nbe formed at lower firing temperatures. However, differences in the proportions of these and \n\nother important elements provide hints for manufacturing techniques.  \n\nThe positive correlation between Si-K for both faiences and wall-tiles suggests that the \n\nhigher the network-forming agents the higher the need for fluxes addition (such as K).  \n\nMoreover, the positive correlation between Pb-Zn in wall-tiles from Lisbon suggests the use of \n\nmore fluxes than in faiences (Coimbra), which implies then a lower melting point for the glazes \n\nin samples from Lisbon than from Coimbra. This was also supported by the SEM/EDX analyses, \n\nin which the glazes from wall-tiles have more fusibility (higher content in network modifiers \u2013 \n\nfluxes) than the ones from faiences.  Pb and Na act as dominant fluxes within the glassy matrix \n\nand lower the melting temperature [37].  \n\nBy the inspection of original documents that contain some recipes used to produce glazes, \n\nthey were applied as frits. This process comprises at least two stages: i) roasting a mixture of \n\nlead and tin, which is mixed further with sand and then melted. In accordance with this step, \n\nanalyses of medieval frits always yielded a PbO\u2013SiO2 melt with SnO2 particles. ii) The frit is \n\nground down and applied in a water suspension or mixed with a gum on the ceramic surface. \n\nHowever, regarding the inclusion of Sn-crystals not much is found. Previous investigations \n\nreported by Molera et al. [34] have shown that SnO2 particles react during the glaze formation. \n\nThis study has revealed that SnO2 particles are in the order of several hundred nanometers in \n\n\n\n161 \n \n\nsize that show crystallization faces in tin-opacified glazes. Several reference materials with \n\nvarying amounts of SiO2, PbO and SnO2 were prepared and the heating and cooling processes \n\nwere monitored by means of High-temperature XRD (XRD-HT). Results have shown that SnO2 \n\nreacts with Pb at temperatures > 600 ?C and a metastable phase is formed (PbSnO3). As the \n\ntemperature increases this and other Pb-phases melt and, as the liquid phase starts forming, \n\nSnO2 re-crystallizes [34]. Furthermore, higher numbers of larger-sized particles were observed \n\nas the annealing temperature is increased. \n\nTaking the above into account, SEM micrographs shown in the previous chapter reveal the \n\npresence of higher amount of slightly larger Sn-crystals in glazes from Lisbon which suggests \n\nhigher firing temperature for Lisbon samples. \n\nThe fact that glazes in faiences are thinner (about 150 \u2013 250 \u00b5m) than glazes from wall-tiles \n\n(300 \u2013 400 \u00b5m) is in agreement with the nature of these objects. Faiences are technologically \n\n\u201cfiner\u201d and one of the reasons is the fact that a thinner piece is desired, as most of their utility \n\nis at home both for decoration and functional purposes. Wall-tiles are more robust as they are \n\nused as outer decoration for buildings, which are then subject to all atmospheric conditions. \n\nFurthermore, the cross-section scans provided by 3D Micro-XRF have shown that a smother \n\nconnection between glaze and ceramic body exists for faiences (Coimbra), in comparison to the \n\nwall-tiles (Lisbon) \u2013 where an abrupt drop of Pb occurs between glaze and body. This is due to \n\nthe capillary effect \u2013 described above \u2013 that transfers Pb into lower parts of the ceramic body. \n\nHigher porosity in bodies promotes lead diffusion, which consequently induces a stronger \n\nelemental separation at the interface glaze/body.  \n\n \n\n5.3 Surface decoration \n\nAccording to documental proofs [9] Coimbra was a less wealthy center of production, when \n\ncompared to Lisbon and, hence, the expensive raw materials were spared as much as possible. \n\nTherefore, one would find a broader range of elements used to confer the intended color. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n162 \n \n\n5.3.1 Blue \n\nA higher Mn/Co ratio found in faiences (Coimbra) than in wall-tiles reinforces the hypothesis \n\nthat Mn was intentionally added by the potter in order to spare the expensive Co-source. On \n\nthe other hand, a higher purity in Co-content was found for faiences by the lower Ni/Co and \n\nBi/Co ratios, in comparison to wall-tiles. Still, the slight increase in both Co/Fe and As/Ni ratios \n\nfor faiences (Coimbra) indicates that there was an intention of preparing the pigments with a \n\nhigher level of purity. Moreover, there are positive correlations between Mn-Fe, Mn-Ni, Fe-Ni, \n\nMn-Co, Fe-Co and Co-Ni for the blue in faiences. These correlations were also obtained for wall-\n\ntiles but no correlation between Co and Mn exists, which support the theory of the \n\nintentionally added Mn to the blue pigment used in faiences (Coimbra) but not in wall-tiles. \n\nCluster analyses have shown that regarding the blue pigment composition, two distinct \n\ngroups are formed: one for faiences and one for wall-tiles. In this case the difference is made \n\nbetween types of object rather than between production centers.  \n\nRegarding the cross-section scans performed by high-resolved XRF, some differences in the \n\npigment diffusion throughout the glaze appeared. A higher intake of the blue pigment was \n\nobserved for samples from Coimbra than for samples from Lisbon. There are several factors \n\nthat allow a higher intake of the pigment particles through the glaze: (i) a higher content of \n\nfluxes  in the glaze; (ii) a higher firing temperature of the glaze; and (iii) more refractory \n\npigment particles, meaning that particles do not undergo physical changes when they are \n\nsubmitted to a higher temperature [106]. Since the pigment sources used should be the same, \n\nthe factors which can promote a higher penetration of the pigment in the glaze are (i) and (ii). \n\nConcerning SEM/EDX measurements, one was able to identify Sn-agglomerates throughout \n\nthe whole blue+glaze cross-section among all samples, which is a hint for a certain \n\nmanufacturing process. Co-blue is in its natural state a very strong and dark blue, which is not \n\nthe hue one sees in the blue surface motifs. So, since Sn is a natural opacifier the potter \n\nintentionally added it to the pigment in order to obtain a lighter blue hue. By inspection of the  \n\nThe expected connection between Fe-Co-Ni-As-Bi was not easy to investigate. Co was \n\ndifficult to observe but the other elements that participate on the pigment structure were \n\ninvestigated. Co was found in Fe- or Ni-rich structures but with no structural connection to As \n\n\n\n163 \n \n\nor Bi. However, the As-needle-like structures were always identified in blue regions. A \n\ndifference between faiences and wall-tiles was observed: in faiences Co is found in Fe-rich \n\nstructures while in wall-tiles Co is found in Ni-rich structures [94]. \n\n \n\n5.3.1 Yellow \n\nYellow pigments used in the analyzed samples are Sb-based with connection to Pb as well.  \n\nSEM micrographs have shown that the Sb-crystals are mainly concentrated at the surface of \n\nthe samples (only going deep over the first tens of micrometers in depth). Moreover, \n\ndifferences noticed in the crystal shape and size are indicatives for the same firing cycle the use \n\nof different firing temperatures used [22]. The rather hexagonal shape found for the \n\nmicrostructures in the wall-tiles from Lisbon indicates that, in this context, a higher firing \n\ntemperature was used (? 1100 ?C), in comparison to the samples from Coimbra (from 950 ?C) \n\n(faiences and wall-tiles), whose micro-structure shape is rather irregular and triangular-like. \n\nThus, one can conclude that the firing cycle plays an important role in this simple linear model, \n\nwhich means that similar crystal-morphologies could be obtained for both short-firing cycles at \n\nhigh temperatures and for long-firing cycles at lower temperatures [94]. \n\nFurther information obtained by XAFS revealed differences between manufacturing centers \n\n(at a first approximation) regarding the yellow pigment. By Sb-K speciation, it has been shown \n\nthat the yellow compound is different between Coimbra and Lisbon. In samples from Coimbra, \n\nthe yellow fits quite well to the Naples Yellow (Pb2Sb2O7), while is samples from Lisbon a \n\nmixture of Sb-based compounds has been used. It is important to stress again that these results \n\nare merely in a comparative basis and no definite conclusion is should be withdrawn. Further \n\ninvestigations are already in course in order to conclude more accurately about the chemical \n\nenvironment of Pb and Sb. For this purpose, tests that involve inclusion of self-absorption (SA) \n\neffects are being developed in order to evaluate their influence in this kind of samples \u2013 or \n\nbetter said, matrices. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n164 \n \n\nTable 5.1 \u2013 Summary of the properties of Lisbon and Coimbra productions, from this investigation. \n\nFaiences are a unique type of glazed ceramics. \n\n Coimbra Lisbon \n\n Faiences Wall-tiles Wall-tiles \n\n  Glaze Thickness: max. 180 \u00b5m Thickness: max. 400 \u00b5m Thickness: max. 400 \u00b5m \n\nBlue \n\nPigment (Co) completely \n\ndispersed into the glaze; \n\nPositive correlation \n\nbetween Mn and Co; \n\nPresence of Sn-\n\nagglomerates; Co-structures \n\nare in Fe-rich environment. \n\nPigment (Co) diffused down \n\n~150 \u00b5m into the glaze; No \n\ncorrelation between Mn and Co; \n\nPresence of Sn-agglomerates; \n\nCo-structures are in Ni-rich \n\nenvironment. \n\nPigment (Co) diffused down \n\n~125 \u00b5m into the glaze; No \n\ncorrelation between Mn and Co; \n\nPresence of Sn-agglomerates; \n\nCo-structures are in Ni-rich \n\nenvironment. \n\nYellow \n\nPigment (Sb) thickness: \n\n~30 \u00b5m; \n\nSb-crystals rather \n\nirregular shaped \n\n(triangular-like) ?  \n\n&lt;1000 ?C firing \n\ntemperature; \n\nNaples Yellow \n\n(Pb2Sb2O7) confirmed by \n\nXAFS. \n\nPigment (Sb) thickness: ~100 \n\n\u00b5m; \n\nPb signal strong drop \n\ntogether with Sb signal; \n\nSb-crystals rather irregular \n\nshaped (triangular-like) ?  \n\n&lt;1000 ?C firing temperature; \n\nNaples Yellow (Pb2Sb2O7) \n\nconfirmed by XAFS. \n\nPigment (Sb) thickness: ~100 \n\n\u00b5m; \n\nPb signal slight drop after the \n\npigment layer (Sb); \n\nSb-crystals more regular \n\nshaped (hexagonal) ?  \n\n? 1100 ?C firing temperature; \n\nMixture of Sb-based \n\ncompounds confirmed by XAFS. \n\nPurple \n\nPigment (Mn) completely \n\ndispersed into the glaze;  \n\nPresence of Ba indicates \n\nthe use of (Ba,H2O)2Mn5O10 \n\nas source \u2013 high abundance \n\nin Portugal; relatively low \n\nBa/Mn ratio ? pureness of \n\nthe source. \n\nPigment (Mn) completely \n\ndiffused into the glaze; Mn \n\nmaximum at the surface ~50 \u00b5m \n\nbroad; \n\nPresence of Ba indicates the \n\nuse of (Ba,H2O)2Mn5O10 as \n\nsource \u2013 high abundance in \n\nPortugal; relatively high Ba/Mn \n\nratio.  \n\nPigment (Mn) completely \n\ndiffused into the glaze; Mn \n\nmaximum at the surface &lt;25 \u00b5m \n\nbroad; \n\nPresence of Ba indicates the \n\nuse of (Ba,H2O)2Mn5O10 as source \u2013 \n\nhigh abundance in Portugal; \n\nrelatively high Ba/Mn ratio. \n\nGreen \n\nPigment (Cu) completely \n\ndispersed into the glaze; \n\n \n\nPigment (Cu) well diffused \n\ninto the glaze; Cu maximum at \n\nthe surface ~50 \u00b5m broad. \n\nHigher pigment (Cu) intake into \n\nthe glaze; Cu maximum at the \n\nsurface ~25 \u00b5m broad; two \n\n\n\n165 \n \n\nsamples in which green was \n\nobtained by mixing blue (Co) and \n\nyellow (Sb). \n\nGerenal \n\nfeatures \n\nNo color/glaze interface, \n\nexcept for yellow \n\ndecorations; \n\nSmoother elemental \n\nexchange at the glaze/body \n\ninterface ? less porous \n\nbodies; \n\nPigments analysis: \n\nConstant elemental ratios ? \n\nmanufactured in potter\u00b4s \n\nwheel (more refined \n\nmanufacturing process) \n\nBroader maximum of the \n\npigment signal.

With the hypothesis \n\nthat the productions from Coimbra are unique, this has been confirmed by scientific data. In \n\nthe field of Cultural Heritage it is important to understand the complexity of the objects in \n\norder to use the proper analytical tools for the sough answers. With the released scientific data, \n\nanswers about raw materials and compositional features, at a mineralogical and morphological \n\nlevel, are provided. This has enriched the field of Arts in Portugal and can be used as basis for \n\ndeveloping conservation and restoration methodologies. \n\nThis work has not only provided new information about ceramic productions from Coimbra \n\nand Lisbon but has also brought the need for carrying out further investigations. The sample \n\nuniverse available for this work was good in order to have a comparison basis between these \n\ntwo main ceramic manufacturing centers but analyses on samples from other centers are now \n\nrequired. Although Coimbra and Lisbon were considered the main centers, other centers such \n\nas Porto or Alcoba\u00e7a have played an important role as routes for raw materials and this could \n\n\n\n166 \n \n\nbe a connection string for enriching the knowledge about Portuguese ceramic productions. \n\nNew doors are open for further investigations. \n\n  \n\n\n\n167 \n \n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY \n\n \n\n1.

The ones from Coimbra comprise two sets of\n\nsamples: faiences and tiles. The ones from Lisbon are only tiles (azulejos, in Portuguese). The three main\n\ndivisions of such pieces are the ceramic support (body), glaze and surface decoration. The system\n\ndecoration/glaze is not easy to investigate, due to the high heterogeneity resulting from the mixing\n\nprocedures and firing temperatures used. Moreover, the ability of the pigment to diffuse into the base\n\nglaze varies depending on the composition of both the pigment and the glaze in terms of fusibility. In\n\norder to raster these effects, high resolution techniques are required. In this work, synchrotron micro-\n\nX-ray fluorescence (m-XRF) analysis was performed to monitor the profiles of the characteristic\n\nelements from the colors used and the glaze in well prepared cross-sections of the samples. Key elements\n\nare: Co for blue, Mn for purple, Cu for green, Sb for yellow, Pb for the glaze and Fe for the body. The\n\nmajor difference observed is that faiences have glaze thicknesses between 150 and 200 mm and tiles have\n\nglaze thicknesses between 350 and 400 mm. Furthermore, in faiences all the pigments except the yellow\n\nones are well dispersed into the glassy matrix, while in tiles, all of them are just partially diffused\n\nthroughout the glaze. However, differences between the tiles from Coimbra and Lisbon were observed.\n\nIn the samples from Lisbon, a higher intake from the pigment throughout the glaze is observed.\n1. Introduction\n\nTo gain knowledge about Cultural Heritage (CH) objects,\n\na physical\u2013chemical characterization is required. A better\n\nunderstanding about the technologies used in the past is valuable\n\nfor accurate object assignation as well as for conservation and\n\nrestoration purposes.\n\nFor several years now there have been numerous references to\n\ndifferent investigations bridging science and art. The use of\n\ndifferent analytical techniques has been revealed to be the proper\n\nmethodology for the study of CH. However, one must be aware\n\nof the advantages and limitations of each chosen method. This is\n\nthe reason why one should always use a multianalytical approach\n\nin order to better characterize the given objects/samples.\naAtomic Physics Centre, University of Lisbon, 1649-003 Lisbon, Portugal.\nE-mail: luisa@cii.fc.ul.pt\nbBAM Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing, 12200 Berlin,\nGermany\ncInstitute of Atomic and Subatomic Physics, Vienna University of\nTechnology, 1020 Vienna, Austria\ndDept.

Spectrom., 2012, 27, 966\u2013974\nWith regard to ceramics studies (pigments, glazes, ceramic\n\nsupports), several manuscripts can be found that describe the use\n\nof various analytical methods, for example, X-ray fluorescence\n\n(XRF),1\u20135 X-ray diffraction (XRD),2,4,6 Scanning Electron\n\nMicroscopy (SEM),1,6\u201310 Raman spectroscopy and Fourier\n\nTransform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy4,11,12 and also X-ray\n\nAbsorption Fine Structure (XAFS).2,4,5,13,14\n\nIn the universe of CH studies, glazed ceramic objects are\n\nrecognized by their high degree of complexity. In this case,\n\nfragments from the XVIth to XVIIIth centuries were retrieved\n\nfrom two important production centers in Portugal, namely\n\nCoimbra and Lisbon.\n\nWhen analyzing glazed ceramic pieces, one has to consider\n\nthree important areas that comprise these objects: (1) the ceramic\n\nsupport (or body), (2) the glaze and (3) the surface decoration\n\n(color). The way these layers interfere with each other is strongly\n\ndependent on the raw materials chosen and on the\n\nmanufacturing process used by the craftsman. Based on an\n\nongoing investigation, this manuscript offers complementary\n\ninformation about the possible techniques used to produce such\n\npieces. The analyzed glazed ceramic objects belong to a class\n\ncalled Majolica, produced mainly between the XIVth and XVth\n\ncenturies in the Iberian Peninsula, based on Islamic traditions \u2013\n\nthe so-called Hispano-Moresque wares.15 Previous investigations\nThis journal is \u00aa The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ja30030c\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ja30030c\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ja30030c\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ja30030c\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ja30030c\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ja30030c\nhttp://pubs.rsc.org/en/journals/journal/JA\nhttp://pubs.rsc.org/en/journals/journal/JA?issueid=JA027006\n\n\nTable 1 Set of significant analyzed samples from each production\ncentre, their types and a summary of their characteristics, and the\nelemental composition obtained previously by XRF.

The aim of the craftsman was to have a white glaze as the\n\nbase for surface decoration, and opacifying it with tin oxide\n\ninclusions was discovered to be the most favorable technique,\n\neven though opacification with other more ancient methods, such\n\nas inclusion of bubbles, is still found in these pieces.\n\nAn important piece of information for better understanding\n\nthese objects is the amount of each compound present in the\n\nglazes. Previous analyses performed by Scanning Electron\n\nMicroscopy with an Energy Dispersive System (SEM-EDS)16\n\nrevealed that the glazes from the Coimbra pieces reveal relatively\n\nhigh amounts of K2O (8.1\u20139.3 wt%) and CaO (3.1\u20133.2 wt%) when\n\ncompared with the ones from Lisbon (K2O: 4.3\u20135.8 wt% and CaO:\n\n0.8\u20131.1 wt%). In addition, the amounts of Na2O (0.8\u20131 wt%) and\n\nPbO (40.1\u201340.5 wt%) in Coimbra are lower than the ones in\n\nLisbon (Na2O: 3.5\u20134.2 wt%, and PbO: 45.5\u201345.9 wt%).\n\nAs for the pigment composition, by X-ray fluorescence tech-\n\nniques we were able to retrieve the basic elemental profiles from\n\neach color used.16 Blue: the typical elements detected were Fe, Ni,\n\nCo and As (Smalt) with the presence of Mn and Ba in certain\n\ncases, mainly from Coimbra. Purple: the dominant element is\n\nMn, and the presence of Ba indicates that the mineral Psilome-\n\nlane [(Ba,H2O)2Mn5O10] was used as the raw material to obtain\n\nMn. Green: Cu-based pigment. Yellow: the presence of Pb and\n\nSb indicates the use of lead-antimonate (Pb(SbO3)2).\n\nKnowing all these premises, monitoring the profiles of the\n\ncharacteristic elements from the three main \u2018\u2018layers\u2019\u2019 is of interest:\n\nCo for blue, Mn for purple, Cu for green, Sb for yellow; Pb for\n\nthe glaze; and Fe for the body. For clarifying the production\n\ntechniques used in both centers (Coimbra and Lisbon), impor-\n\ntant issues to investigate are the system glaze/surface decoration\n\nand the ability of the pigment to diffuse into the base glaze. In\n\norder to understand these issues, we performed m-XRF analysis\n\nwith a Compound Refractive Lens (CRL) on polished cross-\n\nsections. Synchrotron radiation together with exceptional optics\n\nallows us to have a 1 mm beam, which provides information\n\nabout the diffusion of the pigments throughout the glaze and the\n\nglaze throughout the ceramic support.\n\nGiven the fact that one of the major compounds forming the\n\nglaze is lead, strong absorption effects can always take place\n\nwhen one performs investigation with X-rays. However, as\n\npreviously shown,16 cross-section scans are one of the best\n\nmethods to monitor the elemental profiles in depth. This brings\n\nvaluable information about system color/glaze/body. The high\n\nlateral resolution offered by the experiment described here\n\nallowed us to obtain detailed elemental information, which is\n\nrarely achieved by most of the laboratory experimental\n\ntechniques.\n\nFurthermore, surface elemental mappings with a Color X-ray\n\nCamera (CXC) were also performed to get complementary\n\ninformation and knowledge about the pieces. With this technique\n\nit is easy to visualize the elements which characterize each color\n\nused as surface decoration.\nAZLX3 Lisbon Tile Purple Mn, Fe, Ba Mn\nGreen Cu Cu\n\nC41 Coimbra Faience Yellow Fe, Sb, Pb Sb\nAZCO1 Coimbra Tile Yellow Fe, Sb, Pb Sb\nAZLX2 Lisbon Tile Yellow Fe, Sb, Pb Sb\n2.

The main division throughout the whole\n\ninvestigation is between Coimbra and Lisbon. Since for this\n\nstudy there are only tiles available for Lisbon, the differences\n\nbetween faiences and tiles are only considered as a subgroup of\n\nthis work. The main goal of this study was to monitor the profiles\n\nof the characteristic elements from each part of the ceramic\n\npieces. Since some lines of these elements overlap with each\n\nother,16 after collecting the XRF data the spectra were fitted with\n\nPyMCA22 and the fitted values were used for plotting the\n\nelemental profiles.\n\nThe capabilities for high resolution XRF analysis, provided at\n\nBAMline,19 BESSY II electron storage ring, were the reason to\n\nperform this investigation there. The schematic of the BAMline\n\n@BESSY-II is shown in Fig. 1.\n\nIn the present work, two techniques were applied: (a) m-XRF\n\nanalysis on the polished cross-sections of the samples and (b)\n\nsurface elemental mappings obtained with a Color X-ray Camera\n\n(CXC).\n\nTo focus the incident X-ray beam for experiment (a),\n\nCompound Refractive Lenses (CRLs) were used. CLRs are one\n\nof several types of focusing X-ray optics devices and belong to\n\nthe group of refractive optics, in which the X-rays undergo\n\nrefraction at the surfaces between different materials. An\n\nexample is displayed in Fig. 2. Since each lens only provokes\n\na little change in the direction of the X-ray, an array of such\n\nlenses (i.e. Compound Refractive Lenses) is necessary to obtain\n\nacceptable focal sizes and distances.20 Due to their simple design\n\nand alignment, CRLs are one of the most popular X-ray focusing\n\ndevices. The important features are: (i) focusing in the region of\n\n100 nm; and (ii) focusing of X-rays with energies in the range\n\nfrom 5\u2013200 keV is possible. The energy bandwidth of these kinds\n\nof lenses (ca. 100 eV) is very small, meaning that for every energy\n\nvalue, a separate lens has to be manufactured. The fact that the\n\nCRLs require a monochromatic and parallel beam makes them\n\nsuitable for synchrotron beamlines only.\n\nAn example of one CRL used @BAMline is shown in Fig. 3. For\n\nthis beamline designed optics, a beam of 1 mm diameter is feasible.\n\nIn Fig. 4 the layout of the m-XRF experiment at the BAMline and\n\na sketch of the sample composition (tile) in terms of its layers is\n\nshown to illustrate how the scans were performed. For these\n\nmeasurements two lenses were used: one with a nominal energy of\nJ. Anal. At.

This\n\nchoice was made due to the elemental variability present in the\n\ndecorative motifs as well as in the glaze. For the pieces which had\n\nyellow (Sb: Ec(K) \u00bc 30.491 keV) the 33.2 keV lens was ideal, and\nfor the pieces which had blue (Co: Ec(K) \u00bc 7.709 keV), green (Cu:\nEc(K) \u00bc 8.979 keV) and purple (Mn: Ec(K) \u00bc 6.539 keV; Fe:\nEc(K) \u00bc 7.112 keV) colors together with the glaze (Pb: Ec(L3) \u00bc\n13.035 keV) the 20 keV lens was used. Although the lens with\n\na nominal energy of 33.2 keV would have been able to excite the\n\nmedium\u2013low range, the 20 keV lens was used for the measure-\n\nments. This lens, due to its bigger aperture, provides more flux at\n\nthe sample and the absorption efficiency is higher for this\n\nelemental range. As a supplement to this investigation, surface\n\nelemental mappings were performed. For such data collection,\n\na beam with a size of 20 mm ? 5 mm was impinged onto the\nsample and a so-called Color X-ray Camera (CXC) together with\n\n1 : 1 polycapillary optics was used. The CXC records 264 ? 264\nspectra simultaneously with a spatial resolution of 50 mm and an\n\nenergy resolution of 152 eV @ Mn-Ka.21 The first prototype of the\n\ncamera, the SLcam, was provided by the Institute for Scientific\n\nInstruments GmbH.\n3.

Cross-section scans were performed through the blue/\n\nglaze/body of two samples from Coimbra, a faience (C34,\n\nFig. 5a) and a tile (AZCO7, Fig. 5b), and one sample from Lis-\n\nbon, a tile (AZLX1, Fig. 5c). Pictures taken with the incorpo-\n\nrated microscope, in which the different areas of each sample are\n\neasy to observe, are also displayed in this figure. In red one can\n\nsee how the line scans were accomplished from the top of the\n\nsurface down to the ceramic body. These scans were repeated in\n\nthree different regions of the cross-sections.\n\nThe scans compare the Co-K, Pb-L and Fe-K signals, which\n\ncharacterize blue, glaze and body, respectively. The first differ-\n\nence highlighted by these scans is the thickness of the glazes.\n\nWith regard to the faience sample C34 (Fig. 5a), the glaze is\n\napproximately 120 mm thick, while the tile samples (AZCO7 and\n\nAZLX1) have similar glaze thicknesses (between 350 and\n\n400 mm) (Fig. 5b and c). Tracking the Co signal in sample\n\nC34, one sees that the glaze and surface decoration exist as\n\none layer together. The glaze is too thin and the pigment was\n\napplied together with the glaze in one firing stage. Comparison\n\nof the Co signal between the two tiles (AZCO7 and AZLX1)\n\nshows that its maximum is broader in the sample from\nFig. 3 CRL @BAMline (from KIT: www.x-ray-lenses.de).\n\nThis journal is \u00aa The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ja30030c\n\n\nFig. 4 (a) Layout of the m-XRF experiment at the BAMline; (b) a sketch\n\nof the sample composition (tile) in terms of its layers.

There are several factors which allow\na higher intake of the pigment particles through the glaze: (a)\n\na higher content of fusible components in the glaze (lead oxides\n\nand alkaline compounds); (b) a higher firing temperature of the\n\nglaze; and (c) more refractory pigment particles, that is, the\n\nparticles do not undergo physical changes when they are\n\nsubmitted to a higher temperature.23 Since the pigment sources\n\nused should be the same, the factors which can promote a higher\n\npenetration of the pigment in the glaze are (a) and (b).\n\nAnother interesting fact is that the Pb signal in sample AZCO7\n\n(Fig. 5b) has an abrupt drop in the interface glaze\u2013body. This is\n\nnot found to happen in sample AZLX1 (Fig. 5c). There is\n\na smooth drop of the Pb signal when reaching the body of the\n\nsample from Lisbon, allowing a higher intake of the glaze\n\nthroughout the body. In addition, the Fe signal (mainly char-\n\nacteristic of the ceramic body) is higher at the interface glaze/\n\nbody in the sample from Lisbon than in the sample from\n\nCoimbra. These two aspects lead to the preliminary conclusion\n\nthat the glaze and the ceramic body have undergone a higher\n\nchemical exchange in the interface during the firing procedure.\nsamples from Coimbra \u2013 (a) a faience (C34) and (b) a tile (AZCO7) \u2013 and\n\nJ.

Mn is the monitored\n\nelement for the purple decoration since its source is a compound\n\nhighly abundant in Portugal: Psilomelane [(Ba,H2O)2Mn5O10].\n\nOnce again one can see that the faience sample (Fig. 6a) reveals\n\nno interface between color and glaze. The glaze thickness is\n\napproximately 150 mm and the pigment was applied to the glaze\n\nand both had been submitted to one firing stage. There is,\n\nhowever, a moderate connection between the glaze and the body\n\nin this sample, as observed from the smooth decrease and\n\nincrease of the Pb and Fe profiles, respectively.\n\nOn comparing the tiles from Coimbra and Lisbon, it seems\n\nthat the pigment (Mn) is equally well dispersed through the\n\nglaze in both the samples (Fig. 6b and c). However, the Mn\n\nprofile in the sample from Coimbra (Fig. 6b) reveals a broader\n\nmaximum at the surface (?50 mm) than in the sample from\nFig. 6 Cross-section scans were performed through the purple/glaze/body of\n\nand one sample from Lisbon, (c) a tile (AZLX3).\n\n970 | J.

Again one observes a smoother elemental exchange\n\nat the interface glaze\u2013body in the sample from Lisbon (Fig. 6c)\n\nthan in the sample from Coimbra (Fig. 6b).\n\n3.1.3.

On evaluating the Cu signal, the intake of\n\npigment into the glaze seems to be higher in the sample from\n\nLisbon than in the sample from Coimbra. However, a broader\n\nmaximum of the Cu signal at the surface from the sample from\n\nCoimbra (?50 mm \u2013 Fig. 7a) than in the sample from Lisbon\n(?25 mm \u2013 Fig. 7b) is observed.

The\n\njustification is the same as previously explained.\n\n3.1.4. Glazes with yellow decorations. In this section, the\n\nelemental profiles of samples containing yellow decorations are\n\ncompared. Fig. 8 corresponds to the cross-section scans carried\n\nout through the yellow/glaze/body of two samples from Coim-\n\nbra, a faience (C41, Fig. 8a) and a tile (AZCO1, Fig. 8b), and one\n\nsample from Lisbon, a tile (AZLX2, Fig. 8c).\n\nConversely to what has been said regarding the faiences\u2019\n\nfeatures, when one is dealing with yellow pigment, new aspects\n\narise. The yellow pigment found in these ceramic objects is\n\na lead\u2013antimony composite. This has large sized crystals, which\n\nmakes it difficult for the pigment itself to be dispersed\n\nthroughout the glaze as a principle. Furthermore, a single firing\n\nstage just for the pigment (mixed with glaze) could have\n\noccurred. In Fig. 8a one sees that the pigment layer (30 mm) is not\n\ncompletely dispersed into the glaze (?180 mm). At the interface\nglaze\u2013body, once again a smooth decrease of the Pb signal and\n\na smooth increase of the Fe signal is observed.\n\nNow, by comparing the profiles of Fig. 8b and c, some features\n\nare explained. The pigment layers of both samples appear to have\n\nthe same thickness (?100 mm); however, the Pb signal accom-\npanying the pigment (in Fig. 8b) has a high drop at the interface\n\ncolor\u2013glaze, indicating the possibility of a separate firing stage\n\njust for the pigment. This effect is not observed in the sample\nThis journal is \u00aa The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012\nfrom Lisbon. At the interface glaze/body, the Pb and Fe signals\n\nare smoother in the sample from Lisbon (Fig. 8c) than in the\n\nsample from Coimbra (Fig. 8b).\n3.2. Elemental mappings with a Color X-ray Camera (CXC)\n\nSeveral images corresponding to elemental surface mappings are\n\npresented. These images were taken with the so-called Color\n\nX-ray Camera (CXC), and detailed explanation about the\n\nassociated software can be found in ref. 7.\n\nFor these measurements, samples with a broad range of\n\nsurface decorations were chosen in order to obtain a bigger\n\nelemental variety on these mappings. In Fig. 9 one can observe\n\nthe pictures taken of 4 tile samples: AZCO3 (Fig. 9a), AZCO2\n\n(Fig. 9b), AZLX9 (Fig. 9c) and AZLX2 (Fig. 9d). The red square\n\nmarks the area of the image taken with the CXC. For each\n\nelement a color was arbitrarily assigned. In both samples from\n\nCoimbra (Fig. 9a and b), the analyzed areas have a green base\n\ndecoration together with purple motifs on top of it. This explains\n\nthe abundant presence of Cu and Mn. The Cu signal is stronger\n\nin sample AZCO3 since it has a thicker layer of green than\n\nsample AZCO2.\n\nFor the sample from Fig. 9c (Lisbon), the examined area\n\ncorresponds to green, blue and purple motifs over a white glaze\n\nbase. One can see the characteristic Cu, Co and Mn signals from\n\nthe respective colors. At last the sample from Fig. 9d (Lisbon)\n\nwas examined in an area where three different parts are seen:\nJ. Anal.

By the elemental mapping shown in this\n\npicture, one can see perfectly the characteristic Pb signal from the\n\nglaze lying underneath the Sb signal from yellow and the Mn\n\nsignal from purple. An interesting feature is that the darker\n\npurple line in this area has less contribution from Pb than the\n\nbrighter part of the purple decoration, where Mn is completely\n\ndisseminated with the Pb, throughout the glaze.\n4. Conclusions\n\nThis study is part of an ongoing investigation, and the number of\n\nsamples used here was chosen to be representative of each type of\n\nceramic as well as the centre of production. The results reported\n\nare given as an example of application and the archaeometric\n\nconclusions hereby presented have a strong support from\n\nprevious studies as mentioned throughout this manuscript.\n\nThe most important conclusion one can draw from this work is\n\nthe usefulness of this method of investigation, and its potential in\n\nstudying these types of CH objects is shown.\n\nCross-section elemental scans with a 1 mm lateral resolution\n\nwere performed and general features were extracted. In Table 2,\n\na summary of the properties of the Lisbon and Coimbra samples\n\nis presented. The major difference is related to the glaze thick-\n\nnesses of faiences and tiles. Faiences revealed a glaze thickness of\n\nup to 180 mm, and tiles revealed a glaze thickness of up to\n\n400 mm.\n\nIn general, the maximum of each pigment\u2019s characteristic\n\nsignal is broader in the tile samples from Coimbra than in the\n\nones from Lisbon. However, a slightly higher intake of the\n\npigment throughout the glaze in the tile samples from Lisbon is\n\nobservable.\n\nAnother feature is that the tile samples from Lisbon seem to\n\nhave a broader glaze/body interface than the ones from Coimbra.\nThis journal is \u00aa The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012\nThis means that the chemical exchange between some elements\n\nfrom the glaze and some elements from the body took place in\n\na more pronounced way in the samples from Lisbon. Taking\n\nthese results into account, several points must be discussed.\n\nThere is a high possibility that the glaze was applied raw,\n\nmeaning that it had not undergone a previous firing process\n\nbefore being applied onto the bisque (fired ceramic body).23 This\n\nconclusion derives from the fact that the glazes show defects like\n\nvoids or cracks on naked eye inspection. This would have been\n\nmuch less probable if the glaze had been applied as a frit (pre-\n\nfiring process) before application onto the bisque. The raw glaze\n\nis then mixed with water and applied onto the bisque to be fired.\n\nThe lead compounds are water soluble and during the firing\n\nprocess, water is highly absorbed by the ceramic support and this\n\nprocess drags the lead compounds to the lower part of the glaze.\n\nThis migration may also occur with other compounds, such as\n\nFe. The fact that there is a smoother chemical exchange between\n\nPb and Fe in the samples from Lisbon, as already mentioned,\n\nleads to the conclusion that Pb migrated further down the glaze\n\nand the samples from Lisbon were subjected to a higher firing\n\ntemperature. This last conclusion is also supported by the fact\n\nthat the pigment intake in the sample from Lisbon is higher than\n\nthat in the samples from Coimbra.\n\nFurthermore, the faiences reveal a typical thin glaze together\n\nwith pigment application in a single firing stage. This conclusion\n\ncomes from the fact that the signal from Pb and the element\n\nwhich typifies the color have similar profiles. However, the\n\nyellow decorations do not reveal this. The yellow pigment is\n\nmuch denser than the other ones (blue, green, purple) making its\n\ndissemination throughout the glaze difficult. Moreover, this\n\ncould also be indicative of a single firing stage for the yellow\n\npigment (mixed with glaze), which was then applied over the base\n\nglaze layer.\nJ. Anal. At.

By naked\neye inspection, there are several characteristics about a certain piece,\nwhich one can extract immediately: the brightness of a glaze and the\ncolor palette, among others. Although these characteristics give hints\nabout how the piece was produced, they are not sufficient to\ncharacterize it.\n\nTo extend knowledge about the manufacturing procedures\ninvolved in the glazing and surface decoration is the main goal of\nthis investigation. The items, which served as object of study, were\noriginally produced between the 16th and 18th centuries in two main\ncenters in Portugal: Coimbra and Lisbon.\n\nA glazed ceramic object can be divided in three main parts: (1) the\nceramic support, (2) the glaze and (3) the surface decoration (Fig. 1).\nThe areas marked in red correspond to the interface color/glaze and\nglaze/ceramic support. Interface is defined here as an area where a\nmixture of two distinctive \u201clayers\u201d can be found. The surface\ndecoration can be more or less dispersed within the glassy matrix,\ndepending on the kind of glaze (in terms of chemical composition)\nand/or the firing temperature used. Information about the historical\nbackground of the pieces as well as the chemical composition that\ncharacterizes each part, including the pigments composition, is\navailable in previously published works [1,2].\n\nAccording to the limited documentation about the possible\nmanufacturing procedures involved in Portuguese glazed ceramics\nbased on historical facts [3], several opinions have been developed\nabout the raw materials, the glaze and color application as well as the\nfiring stages and temperatures used at different centers of production,\nsuch as Coimbra and Lisbon.\n\nIt is known that Coimbra was a less wealthy center of production,\nwhen compared to Lisbon and, hence, the expensive raw materials\nwere spared as much as possible. Therefore, one would find a broader\nrange of elements used to confer the intended color. One example is\ngiven by the blue pigments, in which the source of cobalt (Smalt: a\nground blue containing Co) is the main and expensive element. In the\nsamples from Coimbra, additional elements can be found, such as Mn\nto spare the cobalt source. For that reason, in the samples from\nCoimbra the blue color has a kind of old-\u201cpinkish\u201d tone mixed to it.\nFurther assumptions are related with the history of the country itself,\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sab.2011.02.007\nmailto:luisa@cii.fc.ul.pt\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sab.2011.02.007\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/05848547\n\n\nFig. 1. Model of a polychrome glazed ceramic. The areas marked in red correspond to\nthe interface color/glaze and glaze/ceramic support.\n\n298 A. Guilherme et al. / Spectrochimica Acta Part B 66 (2011) 297\u2013307\nparticularly that Lisbon had more influence from the Muslim\noccupation than Coimbra, so the recipes may have kept rather\ndifferent from each other [4].\n\nThere are several possibilities to obtain the final piece. In all cases,\na firing process for the ceramic support took place and then, it may\nhave happened just one firing process for the base glaze together with\nthe decorative motives or a separate firing process for the decorative\nmotives, after the firing for the base glaze. [5]. So, the piece may have\nbeen submitted to either two or three firing processes.\n\nRegarding this study, we are interested in the interfaces: surface\ndecoration/glaze and glaze/ceramic support, which helps us to\ndistinguish differences in the manufacturing methods, as well as\nthe chosen raw materials for the glaze formation in both production\ncenters. Hence, a detailed study of the elemental profiles through-\nout the interface areas was carried out, by using laboratory X-Ray\nFluorescence Spectroscopy techniques (conventional XRF and 3D\nMicro-XRF). To complement such qualitative data, elemental\ncontent of the surface decoration as well as the glaze beneath/\nwithin were also obtained by means of Scanning Electron\nMicroscopy with an Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy system\n(SEM-EDS).\n\n2. Experimental methodology\n\nA set of fragments from pieces originally produced in Coimbra (11\nsamples) and in Lisbon (9 samples) (Fig. 2) was collected for\ninvestigation. The art historians made the assignation to Coimbra\nand Lisbon on a stylistic basis. All of the fragments were cut with a\ndiamond saw and polished in order to obtain flat cross sections for\nSEM and ?-XRF analyses.\n\nThe experimental approach was the following:\n\ni) Conventional XRF measurements were carried out with a 45\u00b0\ntube-detector geometry setup enclosed in a chamber submit-\nted to a 10 mbar vacuum, belonging to the Atomic Physics\nCentre of the University of Lisbon, and fully described in Refs.\n[1,2]. The X-ray tube is from Oxford Instruments (California,\nUSA); the polycapillary optics are from XOS (New York, USA);\nand the detector is a Vortex-60EX from SII NanoTechnology\nUSA Inc. (California, USA). The measurements were performed\nusing a collimator, which allows an excitation area of about\n1.2 mm2, when the sample is placed at a 1.5 mm distance from\nthe Kapton window, through which the excitation and\nfluorescence beams pass. The operating conditions were\n50 kV and 1 mA, in order to excite the K-lines of such elements\nas Sn and Sb. Each spectrum was acquired for 300 s. Spectra\nwere collected using a multichannel (4096 channels) and\nrecorded both in binary mode and in ASCII data mode in order\nto perform their evaluation using the PyMCA software code [6].\nWith this spectrometer, measurements were performed\nperpendicular to the surface of each sample on each color\nand on the glaze. By using the collimator, a large area of\nanalysis is obtained, which is more representative of the\nwhole sample. Decoration and glaze areas are in all cases\nlarger than 1.2 mm2.\nThe purpose of this investigation is to have intensity ratios\nfor specific elements, which will provide us fingerprints of\nboth production centers.\n\nii) 3D Micro-XRF measurements were carried out with a tabletop\nsetup from the Institute for Optics and Atomic Physics at the\nTechnical University of Berlin. This system is a common\ndevelopment with ifG (Institute for Scientific Instruments).\nThe X-ray tube is from Rtw R\u00f6ntgen-Technik (Neunhagen,\nGermany); the polycapillary optics are from IfG (Berlin,\nGermany); and the detector is from Bruker nano (Berlin,\nGermany). The leading feature of this system is the ability to\nperform depth-resolving analysis as is fully described in Ref.\n[7]. Due to the high amount of lead in the samples, strong\nabsorption effects took place. This leads to an information\ndepth of several tens of micrometers, only, which prevents\nfurther depth resolution. Nevertheless, we took advantage of\nanother feature of the confocal geometry, which is probing site\nselection. The probing volume created in the confocal geometry\nallows selective analysis in a certain volume in the micrometer\nregime, which reduces the amount of detected scattered\nradiation considerably. Therefore, scans just on the surface of\nthe polished cross section of each sample were performed, in\nsteps of 5 ?m (each during 60 s) through a length that varied\naccording to the thickness of the relevant part of the sample.\nThe operating conditions were the maximum for this system:\n50 kV and 600 ?A. The Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of\nthe probing volume obtained for Cu\u2013K? (8.04 keV) was\napproximately 42 ?m.\nIn addition to the measurements in confocal geometry (3D),\nMicro-XRF measurements (2D \u2014 with lenses in the excitation\npath only) were carried out at the same cross sections.\nComparing scans along the same cross section obtained by\nthe two methods, the confocal geometry enables a better\nresolving of the elemental profiles along the cross sections, as is\nshown in Fig. 3. In this figure we see two scans performed along\nthe cross section of the same sample (C29) capturing the\npigment (purple), glaze and ceramic support, in 3D mode (a)\nand in 2D mode (b). In 3D mode, we can clearly see that there is\nan interface layer between the pigment and the base glaze,\nwhile with the 2D mode the transition is not so clear. This may\nlead to wrong conclusions about the pigment application on\nthe glaze (see Results and discussion section).\nWith these results, we are able to monitor the profiles of\ncertain elements through the interface color/glaze and glaze/\nceramic support. It enables conclusions about the diffusion\nability of elements, which give color, and about the fusibility\nof the glaze for these elements. These results also contribute to\nrevelations on firing temperatures used in both manufactur-\ning centers.\n\niii) Examinations by SEM were carried out with a Hitachi S4100\nsystem from Bruker (Tokyo, Japan), equipped with Quantax\n400 EDS system of Bruker AXS (XFlash Silicon Drift Detector)\n(Berlin, Germany). A 15 kV acceleration voltage and a current\nintensity of 32 ?A were applied. The chemical information by\nEDS was taken from an area of 300\u00d7400 ?m2 selected\nregarding its homogeneity and lack of voids, with spectrum\nacquisition times at a minimum of 60 s. The semi-quantitative\nresults were based on a peak-to-background ZAF evaluation\nmethod (P/B-ZAF), being ZAF a matrix correction, mainly based\non analytical expressions for atomic number (Z), X-ray yield,\nself-absorption (A) and secondary fluorescence enhancement\n\n\n\nFig. 2.

Guilherme et al. / Spectrochimica Acta Part B 66 (2011) 297\u2013307\n3. Results and discussion\n\nThe results we present, are representative of the whole set of\nsamples analyzed from both production centers. The measurements\nperformed with all methods were carried out in all samples, and\nrepeated in at least three spots.\n\n3.1. The (white) glaze\n\nIn a common way, the glazes from both production centers belong\nto a class of \u201ctin opacified lead glazes\u201d, in which the main components\nare SiO2, PbO and SnO2. What differentiates the productions is the\nratio between the amounts of these and other important oxides, such\nas Na2O, K2O and CaO.\n\nWith SEM-EDS, the uniform distribution of cassiterite crystals\n(SnO2) throughout the glazes was evident. Tin and lead were usually\nburnt together and then added to the glaze. This way, tin oxide was\nfirst dissolved in a silica and lead vitreous matrix and during the firing\nprocess of the glaze, at a temperature of 650 \u00b0C, it recrystallized in the\ncassiterite structure (SnO2). Once in this form, SnO2 becomes\ninsoluble in the glaze [8].\n\nAs an example, Fig. 4 displays an image taken perpendicular to the\nsurface of the glaze (not colored) from the pieces (a) C41 from\nCoimbra and (b) AZLX1 from Lisbon. One can see how well distributed\nthe tin oxide crystals are within the glassy matrix. Their length varies\nbetween 0.5 and 0.8 ?m for the former (a) and between 1 and 2 ?m for\nthe latter (b). Furthermore, the EDS results (from SEM-EDS) in Table 1\nreveal some differences between the two production centers worth to\ndiscuss. The glazes produced in Coimbra reveal relatively high\namounts of K2O (8.1\u20139.3 wt.%) and CaO (3.1\u20133.2wt.%) when\ncompared with the ones from Lisbon (K2O: 4.3\u20135.8wt.% and CaO:\n0.8\u20131.1wt.%). This in addition to the amounts of Na2O (0.8\u20131wt.%)\nand PbO (40.1\u201340.5wt.%) in Coimbra compared to the ones in Lisbon\n(Na2O: 3.5\u20134.2wt.%, and PbO: 45.5\u201345.9wt.%), leads us to the\npreliminary conclusion that the glazes of Lisbon have more fusibility\nFig. 4. SEM image perpendicular to the glaze surface of a sample from Coimbra (a: C41)\nand a sample from Lisbon (b: AZLX1).\nthan the ones from Coimbra. The higher amounts of Na2O and PbO\nindicate that the melting point of the glaze is lower than the ones\nwhere higher amounts of K2O and CaO are present. It is already known\nthat Na and Pb compounds, acting as dominant fluxes in the glaze,\nlower the fusion temperature [9].\n\nOther significant results are the ones obtained with the cross\nsection lateral scans performed with the 3D Micro-XRF setup. Fig. 5a\nand b exhibits the profiles for one glaze from Coimbra (a: C41) and\none from Lisbon (b: AZLX1), respectively, for the elements Pb, Sn and\nCa. Scans performed in all the pieces from Coimbra showed that the\nglaze thicknesses vary between 150 and 350 ?m, whereas the ones\nfrom Lisbon vary between 300 and 400 ?m, by monitoring the energy\nline of the element, which mainly characterizes the glaze: Pb\u2013L?\n(10.54 keV). These scans also support the results obtained by SEM-\nEDS: tin (Sn) is well distributed within the glassy matrix and the\nglazes from Coimbra reveal a higher concentration of Ca than the\nLisbon ones, when compared to the other elements in the glaze of the\nsame sample. Together with the images obtained by the microscope\ninside the confocal system, one can easily observe a very well defined\ninterface glaze/ceramic support, being approximately 50 ?m for the\nCoimbra sample and smaller than 30 ?m for the Lisbon one.\n\n3.2. Colors and pigments\n\nConcerning polychrome glazed ceramics, some facts must be taken\ninto account. The colors employed on the pieces were usually\nobtained by metallic oxides, which could have been used in a \u201cpure\u201d\nstate or in a mixture called frit, which is a pre-melting of the pigment\ntogether with fluxes, such as Pb, Na, and sometimes even Sn (to make\nit more opaque). After cooling down, this mixture (frit) was grinded\nuntil a powder was obtained and then applied over the \u201cbase glaze\u201d.\nThe brilliance or opacity and the migration ability of the elements,\nwhich grant the color, are some factors that help assign the way the\npigment was applied onto/within the glaze [10].\n\n3.2.1. Blue\nIn general, blue is the most common color in glazed ceramics. The\n\ndecorative motives as well as the tones used, make the difference.\nMeasurements performed with the conventional XRF setup gave us\nthe possibility analyzing bigger areas (due to the collimator) of the\nblue color from both production centers. These analyses were\nperformed on the surface and, in order to identify the spectra from\nthe blue color, spectra from the glaze next to these areas were\nsubtracted. The typical elements detected were Fe, Ni, Co and As\n(Smalt) with the presence of Mn and Ba in certain cases mainly from\nCoimbra, as it was already discussed [2].\n\nIn Fig. 6 we can observe: a) comparison between spectra obtained on\nthe blue color and the respective glaze of a sample from Coimbra (C34);\nb) comparison between spectra obtained on the blue color and on the\nrespective glaze of a sample from Lisbon (AZLX1); c) comparison\nbetween the spectra obtained for the blue colors in Coimbra (C34) and\nLisbon (AZLX1) and d) intensity ratios for the elements associated to the\nblue pigment (Smalt). From Fig. 6a and b, we can see the elements that\nare associated to the blue color: Mn\u2013Fe\u2013Co\u2013Ni\u2013As are free from\ninterference coming from the glaze, except Fe, which is also present in\nthe glaze. Fig. 6c shows that the samples from Coimbra have higher\ncontent of Mn and Ba and less of Co than the ones from Lisbon, which\nsupports the assumption that Coimbra was a less wealthy center\ncompared to Lisbon. However, as we can see from Fig. 6d not only the\nratios Mn/Co are higher for Coimbra, but also the ratios Fe/Co, due to less\npronounced values for Co in these samples.\n\nIn addition to these results, we present also cross section scans by\n3D ?-XRF together with pictures taken with the microscope. Fig. 7a\nand b shows an example of the different profiles obtained for a\nfragment from Coimbra (a: C34) and one from Lisbon (b: AZLX1).

This may indicate that glaze and pigment were applied\ntogether, as it is also proved by the Co\u2013K? and Pb\u2013L? profiles (Fig. 7a).\nOn the other hand, there is an interface color/glaze in the sample from\nLisbon (Fig. 7b). However, the pigment seems to disseminate quite\nwell through the glaze, which is also proved by the profiles obtained\nfor Co\u2013K? and Pb\u2013L?. In both cases the fact that Sn appears to be more\nabundant in the lower part of the glaze is noticeable (Fig. 7). In the\ncase of the sample from Coimbra, it is evident that Sn is the dominant\nelement on the lower part of the glaze (Fig. 7a). This is in agreement\nwith the assumption that tin crystals are very dense and tend to\ndeposit on the lower part of the glaze [8].\n\n3.2.2. Purple\nAnalyses performed with conventional XRF showed similar\n\nchemical composition in all purple colors from both production\ncenters (Fig. 8). The dominant element to give the purple color is Mn,\nand the presence of Ba in both spectra indicates that the mineral\nPsilomelane [(Ba,H2O)2Mn5O10] was used as raw material to obtain\nMn [11].\n\nFurther analyses performed by SEM-EDS perpendicular to the\npurple surface revealed that the crystals in the purple layer could be\nFig. 5. 3D ?-XRF cross section scans performed on glaze+ceramic sup\nobserved from both centers of production. However, the Mn crystals\nfrom Coimbra (Fig. 9a: C29) are more noticeable in comparison to the\nones from Lisbon (Fig. 9b: AZLX2). The crystals formed on the sample\nfrom Lisbon appear to be more dispersed into the glaze matrix. The\nEDS results from these two samples were obtained by micro-spot\nanalyses and are displayed in Table 2.\n\nFurthermore, interesting results were also obtained with 3D ?-XRF.\nThe profiles in Fig. 10 correspond to cross-section scans made on the\nsame samples. In Fig. 10a, the Mn profile is similar to the one of Pb,\nwhere in the left side of the scan Mn corresponds to the purple color\nand in the right side it corresponds to the ceramic support. It is also\nevident that there is a drop in the Mn and Pb depth profiles between\npigment and base glaze. This was a common result in all analyzed\nsamples from Coimbra and it leads to the conclusion that the pigment\nwas applied as a frit. The interface frit/\u201cbase glaze\u201d clearly remained\nafter the firing process and the two \u201clayers\u201d (frit and base glaze) were\npractically kept individualized from each other, indicating that the\nglaze has low fusibility (due to the presence of Ca also). When we\ncompare these profiles with the ones from Lisbon (Fig. 10b), we see\nthat the pigment is well dispersed into the glaze matrix. Furthermore,\nthere is no accentuated drop in the Pb profile, revealing that the glaze\nis more fusible than the one in Coimbra, as it was already explained in\nSection 3.1: The (white) glaze. This allows a better dissemination of\nthe frit in which the pigment was applied through the base glaze.\nAlthough we cannot compare the profiles of Ca obtained in both\ncenters directly, when we evaluate the profiles Pb and Ca in each\nproduction center, the base glaze from Coimbra (Fig. 10a) has the\nport on a sample from a) Coimbra (C41) and b) Lisbon (AZLX1).\n\nimage of Fig.?5\n\n\nFig. 7. 3D ?-XRF cross section scans performed on blue+glaze+ceramic support of a sample from a) Coimbra (C34) and b) Lisbon (AZLX1).\n\nFig. 6. a) Comparison between spectra on blue and glaze of a sample from Coimbra (C34); b) comparison between spectra on blue and glaze of a sample from Lisbon (AZLX1); c)\ncomparison between spectra on the blue of the two samples; The samples from Coimbra have higher content of Mn and Ba and less of Co than the ones from Lisbon, which supports\nthe assumption that Coimbra was a less wealthy center compared to Lisbon. d) intensity ratio of Fe and Mn with respect to Co, obtained on the blue in the set of samples from\nCoimbra and Lisbon.\n\n302 A.

This is in\nagreement with the higher fusibility of the glazes from Lisbon.\n3.2.3. Yellow/orange\nFrom all the colors used in glazed ceramics, the yellow or orange\n\ncomes out to be the most interesting one. By naked eye observation, we\nnoticed that in Coimbra, this color tends to be orange and in Lisbon yellow.\n\nThe first results were obtained by conventional XRF, where\ndifferent samples were analyzed from both centers and some\ndifferences are already noticed. Fig. 11 shows a spectrum of glaze\nand yellow from Coimbra (a: C41) and from Lisbon (b: AZLX1). From\nthe spectra, we see that this pigment comes from the same compound,\nwhich is a lead\u2013antimony (Pb2Sb2O7) composite called Naples yellow\n[12]. In Fig. 11c, we can see that the samples from Coimbra appear to\nhave higher Fe and Mn count rate than the ones from Lisbon. This may\nbe a justification for the orange tone exhibited by the samples from\nCoimbra. Furthermore, the ones from Lisbon revealed higher count\nrates in Sn and lower in Sb, which possibly indicates that Sn4+, may\nhave replaced the ion Sb3+ in the lead\u2013antimony compound,\nprovoking changes in the molecular structure [13].\nTable 2\nComparison between the purple chromophore phases from Coimbra (C29) and from Lisbo\ncrystals (MnO) formed on the sample from Lisboa are more dispersed into the glaze matr\nrepresent a Relative Error (in %) reported automatically by the software.\n\nSample Na2O MgO Al2O3 SiO2\n\nC29 Coimbra 1.6\u00b10.1 0.6\u00b10.1 3.3\u00b10.2 28.4\u00b11.0\nAZLX2 Lisbon 0.7\u00b10.1 0.9\u00b10.1 3.2\u00b10.1 36.3\u00b11.1\nOther relevant results are the ones we could obtain with SEM-EDS.\nFig. 12a and b shows images taken perpendicular to the surface of the\nyellow color in one sample from Coimbra (a: C41) and one sample\nfrom Lisbon (b: AZLX2). Fig. 12c and d displays images taken\nperpendicular to the cross section of the samples in order to evaluate\nthe interfaces in Coimbra (c) and in Lisbon (d).\n\nThe crystals identified in both images (a and b) have a triangular\nand hexagonal shape, which is typical for the Naples yellow pigment\n[12,14]. Additionally, the shape of the crystals is also a hint to estimate\nthe firing temperature. According to Ref. [12], from 950 \u00b0C up some\ncrystals start to form agglomerates, but in an irregular way (as it\nmight be recognized in Fig. 12a, in Coimbra), and only from 1100 \u00b0C\nthe nice hexagonal phase starts to appear (as it is shown on Fig. 12b, in\nLisbon). In sample C41 (from Coimbra) (Fig. 11a) the crystals are\nsomehow irregular and still very small (b1 ?m) in comparison to the\ncrystals in sample AZLX2 (Lisbon) (Fig. 12b), where they are very well\nshaped, having already a hexagonal shape.\n\nFurthermore, the semi-quantitative results obtained from EDS\n(Table 3) on these samples lead to the assumption that different firing\ntemperatures were used. The values of Sb2O5 and SiO2 obtained for\nCoimbra and Lisbon show great discrepancy. This is because in\nCoimbra, the values represent the yellow chromophore phases within\nn (AZLX2).

The one from Coimbra (c) shows clearly an interface\nbetween color/glaze and glaze/ceramic support. These are character-\nized by a certain amount of bubbles, some of them contain cerussite\n(lead carbonate: PbCO3) due to weathering. The picture from the\nLisbon piece (Fig. 12d) is a magnification of the possible interface\ncolor/glaze and in this case, it is not as evident as in the case of the\nsample from Coimbra.

In contrast, the Pb tends to go down the\nglaze due to its higher density. The Sn profiles indicate once again that\nthe SnO2 crystals tend to deposit on the lower part of the glaze.\n\n4. Conclusions\n\nIt is clear that Portuguese polychrome glazed ceramics have an\nintrinsic value by the way they were produced: the broad poly-\nchromic pallet, the obtained tones or even the careful manufacturing\nprocedure in order to achieve such slight differences.\n\nComparing the data obtained for the two main important production\ncenters, Lisbon and Coimbra, new results about the raw materials used\nas well as the possible manufacturing techniques have been achieved.\nDue to the lack of archaeometric information on Portuguese ceramic\nproduction, we used the knowledge from previous works performed on\nSpanish and Italian glazed ceramics [4,8,10,12\u201314], since we are dealing\nwith similar types of samples. Hence, this work presents the first\narchaeometric results about Portuguese glazed ceramics produced in\nCoimbra and Lisbon as a comparative study.\n\nimage of Fig.?12\n\n\nFig. 13. 3D ?-XRF cross section scans performed on yellow+glaze+ceramic support on a sample from a) Coimbra (C41) and b) Lisbon (AZLX2).\n\n306 A. Guilherme et al. / Spectrochimica Acta Part B 66 (2011) 297\u2013307\nThe compositional and microtextural data obtained for both\ngroups of samples revealed differences in the properties of the glazes:\nthe ones from Coimbra are less fusible than the ones from Lisbon. This\nwas noticeable by all the results obtained with the different\ntechniques. Glazes with a higher content of Na and Pb have a lower\nmelting point than the ones with a higher content of K and Ca. This\nwas also evident when the pigments were applied to the glaze in the\nform of frit. For this manufacture procedure, a more pronounced\ninterface between pigment and glaze was found in the SEM images.\nHowever, when the frit and the base glaze onto which the pigment\nwas applied had higher fusibility and/or if the firing temperature was\nhigher than in other cases, the interfaces were not so distinguishable.\nThis could be detected by the 3D Micro-XRF scans. In all images\ncorrespondent to the samples from Coimbra the elements are less\ndisseminated throughout the glaze than the ones from Lisbon. This\nmeans that the element that gives the color (Co in the case of blue, Mn\nin the case of purple and Sb in the case of yellow) is more\nconcentrated on the surface of the sample from Coimbra than the\nones from Lisbon. This lack of ability in going further down into the\nglaze is more related with the glaze composition than with the\npigment itself. However, blue and purple pigments have in principle\nmore ability of diffusion than the yellow ones when applied to the\nsame glaze. This is due to the molecule size and ability in\nhomogenizing themselves into the glassy matrix.\n\nAnother conclusion can be drawn from the analysis of the yellow\npigment. Not only the dissemination of the pigment throughout the\nglaze is less in the samples from Coimbra but also the irregularity of\nthe crystals in the yellow seen in these samples is higher in\ncomparison to the hexagonal shaped crystals from Lisbon. This\nindicates that the samples from Lisbon were submitted to a higher\ntemperature than the ones in Coimbra.\n\nSummarizing, in this study, some questions mainly related to the\nglaze properties have been clarified by comparing the manufacturing\ncenters of Coimbra and Lisbon as well as the pigment application and\npossible firing temperatures used.\n\nAs a next step of the project, it becomes necessary to evaluate the\nsurface composition of all samples with ?-XRD together with ?-Raman\nin order to know the local composition of the pigments, and their\nevolution along the time.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work is within the frame of the Portuguese\u2013German FCT/\nDAAD bilateral collaboration exchange program on \u201cInvestigation on\nglazed Portuguese ceramics through spectroscopy techniques\n(EDXRF, 3D Micro-XRF, XRD and SEM-EDS)\u201d.\n\nThe authors would like to thank Dr. Alexandre Pais for having\nsupplied the samples, property of the \u201cMuseu Nacional do Azulejo\n(MNAz)\u201d (National Tile Museum).\n\nReferences\n\n[1] A.

Introduction\n\nThe presence of coloration in an art object is one of the first\ncharacteristics to draw our attention and sometimes a starting point\nto make some cataloging about it. In fact, color has played an\nimportant role since ancient societies dated back to Egyptian times\n[1].\n\nWhen the first Egyptians used color they believed it had magical\nabilities related with healing. They created the \u201cBlue frit\u201d by grinding\ndown blue grass. The \u201cBlue frit\u201d, also known as \u201cEgyptian blue\u201d, is\nmade from quartz, lime, a copper compound, and an alkali flux, all\nheated to a temperature between 850 and 1000 \u00b0C [2]. Frit is a\nceramic composition that has been fused, quenched to form a glass,\nand granulated. Frits form an important part of the batches used in\nceramic glazes; the purpose of this pre-fusion is to render any\nsoluble and/or toxic components insoluble by causing them to\ncombine with silica and other added oxides and also to form a more\nuniform glaze surface on which the pigments can be applied more\neasily [3,4].\n\nColor still creates an impact in our perception to define a certain\nobject, regarding the cultural heritage of a country. For example, in\nPortuguese ceramic manufacture there was a marked preference for\nbluish glazes rather than yellowish in the decorative ceramic pieces.\nThe ones which tend more to yellow-like color were seen as more\ncommercial and not so fine as the blue-like ones [5].\n\nIn order to improve the knowledge of Portuguese glazed ceramics,\nthis work aims to identify the colors used on this special type of\npottery, which intend to identify \u201cfaiences of Coimbra\u201d. Therefore, we\nquantify the kind of used pigments, as a key to classify the museum\npieces. This investigation brings additional information regarding a\nformer study already published by the authors [6], where the ceramic\nsupport and glaze of the same kind of pottery were characterized.\n\nHistorical and documental research based on examination of style,\ndecorative motives and manufacture techniques provide a crucial\nset of information regarding typological and provenance matters.

Guilherme et al. / Spectrochimica Acta Part B 65 (2010) 328\u2013333\naddition to this classification method we will provide scientific\nresults, in particular through the use of in situ micro Energy Dispersive\nX-ray Fluorescence (\u00b5-EDXRF).\n\nMany special features like providing a good elemental coverage,\nhigh sensitivity for a wide range of elements and non-destructiveness,\nhave labeled the XRF technique the most popular and the best starting\npoint of a detailed scientific investigation [7\u201311]. These features\ntogether with a good quantification method and accomplished with a\ngood statistical data treatment are in many cases enough to\ncharacterize the kind of objects at stake.\n\n2. Materials\n\n2.1. Provenance context\n\nThe type of pottery we study in this investigation is influenced\nby Northern Africa cultures especially from Maghreb. During the\nRenaissance, the tin glaze method applied to the ceramic body was\nmanufactured in that region, which was rapidly spread to the\nsouthern European countries [3].\n\nThe ceramic pieces with this kind of glaze may have two\ndesignations: majolica or faience. The designation is associated to\nthe place from where they were exported: from Majorca (Spain) or\nfrom Faenza (Italy), respectively. The faiences according to this\ntechnique were for the first time produced in Portugal in potteries\nfrom Lisbon on the second half of the XVI century [12].\n\nAt this time (end of the 16th century until beginning of the 17th)\nthe Portuguese ceramic production consisted on common objects\nwith \u201cfast-made\u201d decorative motives, which made this faience pro-\nduction the cheapest one and the preferred one from the middle class\nto use in their daily life.\n\nIn the first half of the XVII century we witness a reduction of the\npeople involved in the ceramic production, maybe due to outcome of\nmany cases of Pest diseases.\nFig. 1. Examples of glazed ceramics from Coimbra: (a) polychrome piece \u201cPrato Vasconselos\u201d\ndecorative motives used in these pieces only in blue, such as laces (marked in the picture), t\npiece from Coimbra: 14.5\u00d724\u00d7\u00d815 cm.\nIn the second half of the XVII century, an increase of production in\nCoimbra was noticeable. At this time there was an offspring of new\ndesignations for this kind of activities (porcelain painters, oil painters\nand ceramic tileworks\u2014Portuguese azulejo).\n\nFrom the polychromic patterns used in the pieces produced in\nCoimbra, it is possible to distinguish, in a clearly divergent way, the\nproduction of this region from the pieces produced in other big\nproduction centers. To the production in Coimbra we can assign\nseveral features, such as the colors used as contours (Fig. 1). These\nvaried from purple manganese to blue cobalt, enhancing a better\ndefinition of the limits between different decorative motives.\n\nUnder these conditions and based on historical and documental\nresearch, supported by examination of the style, the polychromic\npieces having a mate vitreous surface, covered by dense and earthy\ndecorative tones, seem to be characteristic from Coimbra. However,\nsome doubts are still remaining concerning the pieces where the only\nchromatic tone is the blue. Furthermore, in these pieces two other\ncharacteristics can be allocated. The first one is that a mold from\nwhich all these pieces were manufactured might be existed, and the\nsecond one is that these pieces were performed prior in white, and\nfollowing the glaze firing process some of them have been painted.\nOther characteristics rely on the decorative motives used in these\npieces only in blue, such as laces.\n\n2.2. Sample set\n\nThe analyzed pieces belong to a period between the XVI and\nXIX centuries and they are thought to be originally produced in\nCoimbra.\n\nNowadays these pieces belong to different museums in different\nlocations in Portugal but a recent exhibition, aiming to show a large\nset of Coimbra ceramic manufacture, brought them together.\nThe micro-EDXRF analyses were carried out in situ at the Museu\nMachado Castro in Coimbra.

Overlapping of spectra from three different colored\n\n330 A. Guilherme et al. / Spectrochimica Acta Part B 65 (2010) 328\u2013333\nafter a careful tracking from the historical point of view, 49 pieces\nhave been chosen for analysis. Looking at Table 1 we see that blue is\nin 46 pieces, purple in 27 pieces, green in 15 pieces, yellow in 13 and\nbrown and orange in just 6 pieces. These are the colors to be\ncharacterized.\n\n3. Experimental\n\n3.1. \u00b5-EDXRF method\n\nFor elemental determination, an Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluores-\ncence (EDXRF) spectrometer, with micro beam capabilities was used.\n\nThe \u00b5-EDXRF system consists of a sided-Be window with a Mo\nanode OXFORD XTF5011 X-ray tube and a Silicon Drift Detector (SDD)\nThermoelectrically Cooled (TEC) Vortex-60EX\u00ae (FWHM at 160 eV at\nFe\u2013K? line energy) with an active area of 50 mm2 and a 25 \u00b5m\nthickness Be window. The instrumentation is on a 45 degree detector\nto tube XRF geometric arrangement.\n\nThe characteristic radiation and Bremsstrahlung were emitted by\nmeans of polycapillary focusing optics [13], allowing a focal spot of\n100 \u00b5m for Fe\u2013K?. The distance positioning was accomplished owed\nto two laser points and the analyzed spot could be visualized due to a\ncamera. The X-ray beam as well as the detector snout is housed in a\nvacuum chamber, down to a 10 mbar pressure [14]. These measure-\nments were performed in situ directly on the pieces (Fig. 1d).\n\nEach spectrum was collected during 300 s by a digital pulse\nprocessor with PI-SpecA software application and the spectral\nqualification and further quantitative results obtained by using the\nPyMCA software code [15].\n\n3.2. Statistical data handling\n\nAfter quantifying the elements from the several analyzed pieces,\nwe tried to find some correlations between the elements character-\nistics to each color used in the decoration of the pieces. In order to\naccomplish those correlations we resorted to two statistical applica-\ntions, the Pearson test and the Scatter Matrix Plot.\n\nThe Pearson Correlation Coefficient is usually signified by r (rho),\nand can have the values from ?1.0 to 1.0. A perfect negative (inverse)\ncorrelation corresponds to ?1.0; 0.0 means no correlation, and 1.0\ncorresponds to a perfect positive correlation.\n\nAnother interesting tool is the Scatter Matrix Plot. A scatter matrix\nis a pair-wise scatter plot of several variables presented in a matrix\nformat. It can be used to determine whether the variables are\nareas (purple, yellow and blue) in a polychrome piece.\n\n\n\nTable 2\nCorrelation matrix performed for the blue color.

If\none draws the line Y=x in the square of the relation between two\nelements, and the dots seem to tend to this line, their relation is\npositive; If they tend to Y=?x, their relation is negative.\n\n4. Results and discussion\n\nIn each piece all colors were analyzed in several points and some\npattern arose from the evaluation of the spectra.\n\nWe started by noticing which elemental profile arises from the\nkind of pieces that definitely characterize the ceramics from Coimbra.\n\nIn the blue painted areas (Fig. 2) the elements Fe, Co Ni and As are\npresent. Furthermore, the Pearson test (Table 2) revealed strong\npositive correlation between these elements which is indicative of its\nuse to produce the blue pigment, like ground cobalt glass (Co(SiO2)n)\nnamely smalt, which is a blue glass matrix where tetrahedral holes are\npartly filled with Co2+ ions. The high correlation between Co and Ni\n(0.812) and Co and As (0.714) and also Fe and As (0.725) and Co and\nFe (0.621) indicates that the raw material is related with cobaltite\ngroup mix minerals mainly Cobaltite a Cobalt Arsenic Sulfide ((Co, Fe)\nAsS) and Gersdorffite a Nickel Arsenic Sulfide NiAsS, or the related\nweathered mineral erythrite (Co3(AsO4)2.8H2O), more common as a\nblue pigment [17].\n\nThe purple (Fig. 2) was the second most used color. Through \u00b5-\nEDXRF spectra inspection we could testify that its characteristic\nelement is Mn, which indicates that it was obtained by the use\nof ground manganite mineral originating Manganese Oxide Hydrox-\nide MnO(OH). From the Scatter Matrix Plot (Fig. 3a) for the purple\ncolor we can see a positive relation with Fe since manganite is\nFig. 3. Scatter matrix plots. (a) P\ncommonly related with iron hydroxides (goethite) and iron carbo-\nnates (siderite) in surface sedimentary deposits.\n\nThe spectra corresponding to the green areas revealed Cu as the\ncharacteristic element for this pigment. An exception was revealed by\nthe piece Prato \u201cs\u00e9timo centen\u00e1rio\u201d, containing high amounts of Ti\nand Zn and a very low content of Cu. This might be indicative that the\npiece is a recent one, maybe belonging to the XIX century. In fact, the\nmotives and color densities are different than the rest of the set. In\naddition, the piece has some writings regarding the celebration at the\nyear 1895. The performed tests did not reveal any correlations\nbetween the elements present in the green areas (Fig. 3b).\n\nThe measurements in the yellow colors revealed the presence of Sb\ntogether with very strong peaks of Pb. This suggests a crystalline\nphase of antimony and lead like the synthetic yellow pigment of\nNaples yellow (Pb3(SbO4)2) [18].\n\nNevertheless a positive correlation for these elements was not\nfound (Table 3). This can be explained considering that the pieces are\nlead-based glazes, so the measurements of Pb are always affected by\nthe Pb of the glaze.\n\nOther colors such as orange and brown were also analyzed and the\nobtained spectra present mainly Mn and Fe in their composition. This\nsuggests the use of ochres of these elements. These results are in\nagreement with the documented hypothesis that manganese oxides\nand iron oxides and hydroxides were responsible for the orange and\nbrown colors [5].\n\nThe ceramic production in Coimbra is also distinguished by\nanother characteristic which is the careful and detailed contours\nbetween the painted areas, usually in purple. In Fig. 4 we can observe\nthat the contours are more dense colored areas and this is evidenced\nurple color b) green color.\n\n\n\nTable 3\nCorrelation matrix performed for the yellow color.

Conclusions\n\nFrom this work we can conclude that the glaze decoration\nperformed after the primary glaze was obtained mainly by cobalt\noxide pigments that confer the blue tones, the iron oxides and\nhydroxides responsible for the colors between orange and brown, the\npurple out of manganese oxides (typically used for contours), the\ngreen pigments essentially out of copper, and the yellows are a\npigment based on antimony and lead. The remaining colors or tones\nresult from the \u201cchromatic density\u201d and the combination of these\npigments application.\n\nThis work is a successful application of a polycapillary lens in\nEDXRF portable equipment in order to study the colors, ornaments\nand contours in these exceptional pieces. Furthermore, this also\nemphasizes the use of a non-destructive in situ technique, which is a\nrequisite to study valuable pieces that cannot be removed from the\nmuseums.\n\nAs a final remark we would like to end this work citing an old\ndescription of the ceramics from Coimbra belonging to Joaquim de\nVasconcelos:\n\n\u201cThe only one in Portugal representing the oriental tradition and\npreserving characteristics from the Arabic style. This paint,\nsimulating birds, peacock tails, traced over a background formed\nby green areas, produces a unique effect at one sight, gives to this\nceramics an archaic aspect, which is impossible to confuse it with\nany other region\u201d [5].\nFig. 4.

Guilherme &amp; J. Coroado &amp; M. L. Carvalho\n\nReceived: 6 June 2009 /Revised: 27 August 2009 /Accepted: 2 September 2009 /Published online: 22 September 2009\n# Springer-Verlag 2009\n\nAbstract Chemical, mineralogical and textural character-\nizations were performed on glazed pieces prepared in\nlaboratory as well as on faiences fragments collected from\nthe existing remains in \u201cSanta Clara-a-Velha\u201d monastery\n(Coimbra, Portugal). The chemical investigation was\ncarried out using micro X-ray fluorescence (\u00b5-EDXRF)\nand wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WDXRF);\nthe mineralogical results using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and\nthe textural profile was obtained by scanning electron\nmicroscopy coupled with an energy dispersive spectroscopy\nsystem (SEM-EDS). Attention has been drawn to the glaze\nmineralogical changes during the firing temperature pro-\ncess, where three different types of glazes were submitted\nto three different firing temperatures (800 \u00b0C, 900 \u00b0C and\n1,000 \u00b0C). Under these conditions, it is possible to relate\nthe mineralogical content of the fragments to their firing\ntemperature. Furthermore, we focused our purposes on\nidentifying the technological aspects of the ceramic\nproduction in Coimbra, such as the raw materials, manu-\nfacture techniques and firing temperature adopted for the\nglaze. The latter aspect is highly dependent on the ceramic\nmaterials. In the framework of a more general project, this\nsurvey has as premise the recognition of a pattern, which is\nthought to be exclusively typical from the region of\nCoimbra. The perspective developed in the present work is\n\ntowards reliable archaeometric criteria, which can be used to\ncharacterise scientifically the ceramics from Coimbra.\n\nKeywords Portuguese faiences . Glaze characterization .\n\nSpectrometry techniques . Authenticity. X-ray spectroscopy\n(XPS | XRF | EDX) . Diffraction methods (LEED | X-ray) .\n\nArchaeometry/fine arts\n\nIntroduction\n\nMany ceramic studies are easily found through the\ninspection of scientific international journals [1\u20136]. How-\never, there is an apparent lack of scientific results\nconcerning the ceramic Portuguese cultural Heritage.\n\nSeveral faience fragments, out of a large number,\ncollected originally from the \u201cSanta Clara-a-Velha\u201d monas-\ntery remains, were examined through spectroscopic techni-\nques to obtain their chemical and mineralogical profile.\nWith this statement, we aim to perform consistent criteria\nthat lead to scientific results and define a group of glazed\nceramics (faiences), produced in Coimbra from the six-\nteenth to nineteenth centuries.\n\nBetween the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries, the\nproduction of ceramics in Portugal was based on three big\nproduction centres: Coimbra, Lisbon and Alcoba\u00e7a. How-\never, the different productions of these workshops cannot,\nnowadays, be easily separated.\n\nThe classification of these pieces is exclusively based on\nthe inscriptions associated to the label of the workshop\nmanufactures. It is essential to establish scientific tracers, like\nphysical, chemical, mineralogical, textural and technological\nones, which allow to distinguish these productions centres.\n\nThe importance of the ceramic production in Coimbra is\nvery well documented [7\u201311]. However, in most of the\n\nA. Guilherme : M. L. Carvalho (*)\nDepartamento de F\u00edsica da Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias,\nCentro de F\u00edsica At\u00f3mica da Universidade de Lisboa,\nAv.

For this purpose, two parallel approaches were\nconsidered: first, we studied the glaze coatings applied in\nthe bisque (fired ceramic body) in simulated pieces\nprepared in laboratory. These model samples intend to\nreproduce the composition of the old ones (Fig. 1). We\nsubmitted these samples to three different temperatures,\nselected according to the range of temperatures that might\nbe used in the original production of the sixteenth to\nnineteenth centuries. The glazes applied in the laboratory\nwere obtained commercially in the form of frit, which\nmeans that the raw materials are pre-melted, then cooled\ndown and grinded until obtain a uniform powder. With this\nprocess, the glaze acquires a bigger uniformity (concerning\ndensity and granularity) and the toxicity is reduced [13].\n\nThese pieces were analysed by several spectrometric\ntechniques in order to obtain the data.\n\nIn parallel, we analysed by the same techniques, some\noriginal faience fragments from Coimbra in order to identify\ncharacteristic tracers from this production centre (Fig. 2).\n\nThe existing recognised studies on these faience frag-\nments is supported basically by their chromatic and\ndecorative characteristics, and were based on detailed\ndescriptions of the ceramic production of Coimbra [12].\nFrom this reference, important information can be\nextracted, namely, from the geologic point of view: (1)\nthe ceramic support is generically characterised by a fine\ntexture, light colour and sometimes red spots where non\nplastic elements are millimetric or eye visible, long pores\noriented parallel to the surface are dispersed in the matrix.\nThese aspects reveal the use of several raw materials and\ncarelessness in the paste preparation.\n\n(2) The glaze that is often associated to the ceramics\nfrom Coimbra is mostly characterised by a typical layer,\nwhich is used to masquerade the natural colour from the\nbisque (fired ceramic body), resulting in a matte aspect due\nto its textural composition.\n\nThe studied fragments were identified as belonging to\nthe class of the majolica ceramics (sixteenth to nineteenth\ncenturies).\n\nSome of the most important aspects of majolica\nproduced in Coimbra can be summarised: in 1514 is\nprimarily established the price list of each kind of ceramic,\nbut still no information about the used production tech-\nnique. In this period, the glazed objects start to be frequent\nin Coimbra, due to the bad quality of the clay used for the\nceramic body. In the seventeenth century, for the first time,\nappeared the reference to three different types of ceramic\nproduced in Coimbra\u2014the white one, the green, the yellow\none and the red clay. The oxides could eventually be\napplied in a third firing process, which can explain the\nrevealed chromatic density, and also the matte appearance\nand small white areas. In the eighteenth century, the ceramic\nfrom Coimbra reached the highest point. During this century,\nsome of the masterpieces of the faience from Coimbra were\ncreated and became famous all over the world through the\nPortuguese trade market with colonies from India, China,\netc. In the nineteenth century, a new kind of faience was\nproduced in Coimbra called \u201cRatinha\u201d. It is characterised by\nhaving a coarser paste aspect and a yellowish glaze, due to\nthe bigger amount of tin included in the mixture.\n\nThe selected techniques for this study were: \u00b5-EDXRF,\nWDXRF, XRD and SEM-EDS. EDXRF and XRD are non-\ndestructive and give elemental and chemical composition of\nthe glaze. SEM-EDS allows mostly to identify the\nhomogeneity of the material and WDXRF, besides being\ndestructive, was used in this study as a complementary\ntechnique of \u00b5-EDXRF, for quantitative analysis.\n\nAll are well-established techniques and especially EDXRF,\ndue to its portability, have been used successfully to study\nseveral characteristics in cultural heritage objects [14\u201316].\n\nExperimental\n\nExperimental setup\n\nThe experimental techniques at our disposal were: \u00b5-\nEDXRF, WDXRF, XRD and SEM-EDS. With these\ntechniques we were able to extract the desired information:\nchemical, mineralogical and textural profiles.\n\nThe chemical profile of the prepared glazed pieces as\nwell as the faience fragments was undertaken by \u00b5-EDXRF\nand WDXRF.\n\nThe \u00b5-EDXRF system consists on a sided-Be window\nwith a Mo anode OXFORD XTF5011 X-ray tube and a\nsilicon drift detector thermoelectrically cooled Vortex 60EX\n(FWHM?160 eV at Fe-K? line energy) with an active area\nof 50 mm2 and a 25 \u00b5m thickness Be window. The\ninstrumentation is on a 45\u00b0 detector to tube X-ray\nfluorescence spectrometer (XRF) geometric arrangement.\n\nThe characteristic radiation and Bremsstrahlung can be\nemitted whether by means of a polycapillary lens or by a\n\n2052 A. Guilherme et al.\n\n\n\ncollimator, allowing a focal spot of 100 \u00b5m for the former\nand 1.2 mm for the latter. The distance positioning was\naccomplished owing to two laser points and the analysed\nspot could be visualised by a camera.\n\nThe X-ray beam as well as the detector snout is housed\nin a vacuum chamber, down to a 10 mbar pressure [17].\nThese measurements were performed through a non-\ndestructive method.\n\nThe WDXRF system consists on an XRF spectrometer\nPhilips PW 1410/00, using a Cr-K? radiation. Lost on\n\nignition (LOI) values were obtained by heating samples at\n1,000 \u00b0C for 3 h.\n\nThe mineralogical results were obtained through XRD.\nThese analyses were performed with a Philips X'Pert PW\n3040/60 goniometer, using Cu-K? radiation, 50 kV and\n30 mA, automatic divergent notch graphite monochromator\nand a step size of 1\u00b0/2?/min in the 4\u201365\u00b0 2? range, with data\nacquisition by Philips X\u2019Perta Data Collector v1.2. After\nsamples have dried at 60 \u00b0C, were grinded and pulverised in\nan agate mortar. Identification of crystalline phases by XRD\nwas carried out using the International Centre for Diffraction\nData Powder Diffraction Files (ICDD PDF).\n\nThe surface microchemistry and texture profile of the\nanalysed materials were obtained using SEM-EDS. The\nspecification of this system is a Hitachi S4100, equipped\nwith micro-analysis. The operating conditions were a 25 kV\naccelerating voltage and a 16 mm working distance.\n\nFor all the \u00b5-EDXRF measurements, the working\nconditions were: 40 kV, 1 mA, 10 mbar and 300 s\nacquisition time. The X-rays were emitted through the\npolycapillary lens mode, in order to obtain a detailed\nmapping area of each piece.\n\nSample collection and preparation\n\nAs previously referred, two parallel studies were undertak-\nen in this work.\n\n1. Pieces of three different types of glaze were prepared in\nlaboratory (Fig. 1), labelled: A\u2014\u201cold-like\u201d glass\n(seventeenth century), B\u2014\u201cold-like\u201d glass (eighteenth\ncentury), C\u2014rustic glass.\n\nFig. 1 Glazes A, B and C\n(8 submitted to 800 \u00b0C, 9 sub-\nmitted to 900 \u00b0C, 10 submitted\nto 1,000 \u00b0C)\n\nFig. 2 Faience fragments from the \u201cSanta Clara-a-Velha\u201d monastery\n(Coimbra, Portugal)\n\nCharacterization on glazes of ceramics from Coimbra (Portugal) 2053\n\n\n\nEach type was previously mixed with water, applied on\nnine fired ceramic bodies (bisques) via submersion and then\nsubmitted to three different firing temperatures (800 \u00b0C,\n900 \u00b0C and 1,000 \u00b0C, respectively). The purpose of this\nsurvey using the three different glazes with known\nchemical and mineralogical composition is to observe the\nphase differences and mineralogical changes after each\nthermal transformation. Following the identification of the\nmineralogical changes in the simulated samples, we can\ncorrelate the obtained results for the old glazes, allowing to\nestimate the production firing temperature. These temper-\n\natures were chosen considering the possibilities of working\nconditions for the original production.\n\nThese pieces were analysed by \u00b5-EDXRF and WDXRF\nin order to appraise the elemental characteristics of each\nglaze type, and the influence of firing temperature on\nmorphological changes.\n\n2.

Guilherme et al.\n\n\n\nThe use of raw glazes on traditionally fired products is\na well-established practise. However, the documental facts\nof the ceramic production in Coimbra [12] report a general\ncarelessness in the production procedure, as it was\nmentioned previously, and those facts together with\narchaeological research leads us to believe that the\nuniverse of glazed ceramic production in Coimbra is\nbased on both raw and fritted applications on the bisque.\nDuring the firing process of raw glazes, different process-\nes can occur, such as: decomposition of raw materials,\nchemical reactions giving either crystalline or glassy\nproducts, and melting followed by nucleation and crystal-\nlisation of the melt [18].\n\nResults and discussion\n\nGlazed pieces prepared in laboratory\n\nThe \u00b5-EDXRF analyses were performed on the three pieces\nand for the three different temperatures and for each\nsample, ten points were studied. The obtained results are\ndisplayed in Fig. 3 and correspond to an average of all\nmeasurements. As expected, no elemental changes were\nobtained for the three glazes having different firing temper-\natures (Fig. 3). The confirmation of this fact was necessary\nconsidering that the penetration of the glaze into the\nceramic body could be temperature dependent.\n\nFurthermore, from the semi-quantitative results, consid-\nering that the thickness and matrix composition of the\n\npieces are similar, we can conclude that the three types of\nglazes are different in terms of elemental composition. Both\nA and B are richer in Pb and poorer in Zr, while the rustic\none presents a very high concentration in Zr. Type B,\nsimulating the eighteenth century, is richer in Zn. These\nthree elements are crucial to characterise the type of the\nglaze. Besides these three elements, Sn is also characteristic\nof old glazes, which is not present in the commercial ones.\n\nAll glazes (A, B and C) were obtained by commercial\nfrits and the similarity with old glazes elemental content is\ndecreasing from A to C (Tables 1, 2 and 3). The simulation\nof old-like glazes production is performed by introducing\nquartz and clay minerals to the frit, as it is exhibited in the\nXRD profile of glazes A and B . Moreover, in glazes A and\nB, kaolinite becomes amorphous at 550 \u00b0C and vanishes\nafter the firing process is finished and at 1,000 \u00b0C the\nchanges are basically due to mineral orientation, rather than\nthermal modifications (Tables 1 and 2).\n\nAdditional important aspects are the fact that glaze A\nexhibits more kaolinite and ilite and after the firing process\nis finished, it reveals a more matte appearance than glaze C\n(Fig. 1).\n\nGlaze C is mainly composed by zircon (ZrSiO4), which\nassigns it as a modern one. In its profile is also shown a\npeak of cristobalite, characteristic from a high-temperature\npolymorph of quartz\u2014this means that is has the same\nchemistry as quartz but a different structure (Table 3).\n\nSome of the compounds are only formed after the glaze\nreaches the so called \u201cworking point\u201d. This is the stage\nwhere all components have melted and this liquid matrix\nstate of the glaze originates the formation of some\n\nFiring temperature (\u00b0C) Compound\n\nCristobalite (polymorph of SiO2) Zircon (ZrSiO4)\n\nPowder ?\n\n800 ?\n\n900 ? ?\n\n1000 ? ?\n\nTable 3 Mineralogical firing\ntemperature dependence\nobtained by XRD for the glaze\nC, submitted to 800 \u00b0C, 900 \u00b0C\nand 1,000 \u00b0C, respectively\n\nTable 2 Mineralogical firing temperature dependence obtained by XRD for the glaze B, submitted to 800 \u00b0C, 900 \u00b0C and 1,000 \u00b0C, respectively\n\nFiring temp.\n(\u00b0C)\n\nCompound\n\nKaolinite\n[Al2Si2O5(OH)4]\n\nZircon\n(ZrSiO4)\n\nCassiterite\n(SnO2)\n\nQuartz-low\n(SiO2)\n\nCristobalite (polymorph of\nSiO2)\n\nAnorthite\n(CaAl2Si2O8)\n\nPowder ?\n\n800 ? ? ? ?\n\n900 ? ? ? ?\n\n1000 ? ? ?\n\nCharacterization on glazes of ceramics from Coimbra (Portugal) 2055\n\n\n\nmineralogical components such as skuterrudite (CoAs3),\nanorthite (CaAl2Si2O8) and sodium aluminium-trisilicate\n(NaAlSi3O8). Furthermore, cassiterite (SnO2) crystallises\nfrom 800 \u00b0C. Depending on the amount and on the original\ncomponents from the raw frit, the \u201cworking point\u201d can be\nreached at different temperatures for each kind of glaze\n[19].\n\nAt this point, an interesting fact should be mentioned.\nSkuterrudite only appears due to the initial presence of\ncobalt oxide in the raw frit. This compound causes an\ninteresting optic effect on the glaze and it was commonly\nused to confer some bluish coloration to glaze in order to\nreduce the typical commercial yellowish nature from the\nglazes. From an esthetical point of view, in general people\ntended to prefer the less yellowish glazes. One can even\nprove this fact by observation of the three different glazes\napplied on the ceramic pieces (Fig. 1), where glaze A is less\nyellow than the other two.\n\nFrom the textural point of view, the SEM analyses\nconfirm a certain homogeneity in the glaze composition, as\none can see in Fig. 6. The obtained thickness for the glaze\nis approximately 200 \u00b5m.\n\nFaience fragments (from the sixteenth to nineteenth\ncenturies)\n\nThe general mineralogical composition of the ceramic\nsupports associated to the decorative faiences (C-23, C-24\nand C-26), obtained by XRD is formed by the crystalline\nphases of quartz (SiO2) and minerals of the melillite\n(calcium silicates) (Table 4).\n\nThe glazed surface was obtained, like for the model\nones, during the second firing process by a method that\nallows the reaction between the various raw materials, in\norder to promote the glass formation, which gives rise to\nthe glaze, as well as the used pigments. The firing\n\ntemperature in an oxidant atmosphere for these glazes must\nhave been approximately 950 \u00b0C. This conclusion arises\nfrom the presence of diopside (MgCaSi2O6), due to its\nparticular sensitivity for temperatures above 900 \u00b0C and\nanalcime (CaAl2Si2O8) being weakly electrostatic when\nheated at higher temperatures [20].\n\nCalcite and ilite are of great help to determine the firing\ntemperature at which the pieces were submitted. Complete\nthermal decomposition of calcite can go up to 850 \u00b0C and\nthe presence of augite [(Ca,Mg,Fe)SiO3] indicates precisely\nthat the primary calcite was decomposed [21].\n\nThe chemical composition obtained by WDXRF\nrevealed the content of the major elements, as well as the\nloss values at 1,000 \u00b0C, which are exhibited in Table 5. The\nwater absorption of this material is (about 20 %), which\nfrom the technological point of view helps the glaze\napplication.\n\nThe elemental profile from the glaze of each fragment\nobtained by \u00b5-EDXRF is exhibited in Fig. 4 and shows\ngreat similarity between several analysed pieces, suggesting\nthat the used raw material might be the same. Actually,\nexisting documents corroborate this result stating that\nduring this period (sixteenth to nineteenth centuries) the\nraw material was identical. The glaze is chemically\ncharacterised as a tin glaze, typical from the majolica type\nof ceramic, as it is confirmed by the presence of Sn in the\nspectra of Fig. 4.\n\nThe SEM-EDS measurements were performed via two\noperation modes: wide-area (where inclusions can be\nvisualised) and spot-sized-area (where particular structure\ndetails are observed).\n\nThrough lateral observation of the fragments we could\ncalculate the thickness of the glaze, which was approxi-\nmately 400 \u00b5m.\n\nFurthermore, SEM-EDS observations allowed us to\naccess not only the glaze texture but also its semi-\n\nTable 4 Mineralogical composition obtained by XRD for the fragments C-23, C-24 and C-26\n\nFragment Compound\n\nQuartz (SiO2) Anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8) Diopside (MgCaSi2O6) Analcime (NaAlSi2O6\u00b7H2O) Augite (Ca,Mg,Fe)SiO3\n\nC-23 ? ? ? ?\n\nC-24 ? ? ? ?\n\nC-26 ? ? ? ? ?\n\n% SiO2 Al2O3 Fe2O3 MnO MgO CaO Na2O K2O TiO2 P2O5 Loss\n\nC-23 51.10 18.72 3.72 0.04 4.77 16.35 1.24 2.23 0.79 0.14 0.90\n\nC-24 52.82 17.35 3.75 0.04 4.57 15.52 1.71 1.21 0.81 0.11 2.10\n\nC-26 50.59 18.43 3.78 0.04 4.79 16.21 1.60 2.02 0.79 0.15 1.60\n\nTable 5 Major elements com-\nposition obtained by WDXRF\n(%) and loss at 1,000 \u00b0C of the\nceramic body from the C-23, C-\n24 and C-26 fragments (\u00b1 5%\nerror analysis)\n\n2056 A.

From\nthe obtained results, we conclude that the glaze main\ncomposition is micrometric-sized quartz grains, amor-\nphous particles, rich in SiO2 and Al2O3 which result from\nthe de-hydroxylation of the clay minerals and closed pores\n(bubbles). All together, they confer an earthy and mate\naspect to these glazes.\n\nThese features indicate that the glazes would be an\naqueous suspension of its respective raw materials, namely\nclay minerals, which contribute to the glaze network\nformers (SiO2) and the network stabilisers (Al2O3). The\nchemical composition of the glazes from Coimbra confirms\nthe presence of these components and reveals that the\nfusing agents, the network modifiers were basically PbO,\nK2O and Na2O, as we could confirm by the EDS spectra\n\ncorresponding to the C-24 fragment (Fig. 5). Tin, in the\ncassiterite crystal structure (SnO2), which accumulates in\nthe lower part of the glaze (close to the body), was used as\nan opaque agent, giving a white aspect, as we can see for\nthe C-23 and C-26 pieces (Figs. 7 and 8).\n\nConclusions\n\nThis work proposes a reliable scientific methodology to\nidentify and characterise the Portuguese ceramics. The\nemployment of EDXRF, with the advantage of its portabil-\nity and non-destructiveness of the sample provided ele-\nmental identification. This allowed to characterise the raw\nmaterials used in the glaze preparation of the old fragments\nand hence to assign the type of ceramic: in this case, lead-\nand tin-based (majolica).\n\nAnother issue is the mineralogical identification, which\ngave rise to the second stage of our approach. Through\nXRD, we were able to identify the minerals existent in the\nanalysed samples in the several stages we performed. This\ntechnique has also the advantage of being non-destructive\neven when bigger sized pieces had to be studied. To\ncorroborate the analyses previously mentioned, we also\nperformed SEM analyses to evaluate the textural content of\nthe samples, which aid the mineralogical identification.\n\nThis work is a successful combination of several\ntechniques: \u00b5-EDXRF, WDXRF, XRD and SEM-EDS, in\norder to achieve the chemical, mineralogical and the\ntextural profiles of ceramics.\n\nThe two parallel studies carried out in this work allowed\nus to obtain important results showing the dependence of\nthe firing temperature process on the mineralogical\ncomposition. These results are also extremely important\n\nFig. 7 SEM image from the glaze of the C-23 fragment showing\ncassiterite crystals (SnO2) included in the vitreous matrix.

In addi-\ntion, this work emphasises the possibility to distinguish-\ning the main features of Coimbra production centre,\nscarcely mentioned or even misdated due to non-existing\ninformation.\n\nBy a careful visual analysis of the SEM pictures for each\nkind of glaze, we could testify that one of the major\ncharacteristics relies on the in-homogeneity for old\nceramics and homogeneity for the recent ones (Fig. 6, 7,\nand 8). This is related to the manufacturing process. Glazes\nfrom original pieces are obtained with \u201craw\u201d materials\nwhich, after the firing process, create a more heterogenic\npattern than the ones from the simulated pieces, where the\nglazes were obtained through a fritting process with pre-\nmelted material. This also highlights the big importance of\nthis study in identification of old and modern glazing\nprocesses.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
