The experiment was conducted considering five \ntreatments and thirty replications. the following treatments were applied: stripped soil \nwithout anthropic intervention and total absence of plant cover; stripped soil treated with \nsewage sludge and planted to eucalyptus and grass a year ago; stripped soil developing natural \nsecondary vegetation (capoeira) since 1969; pastureland since 1978, replacing the native \nvegetation; and soil under native vegetation (Cerrado). in the 0.00-0.20 m layer, the soil was \nchemically characterized for each experimental treatment. a 30-point sampling grid was used \nto assess soil porosity and bulk density, and to assess aggregate stability in terms of mean \nweight diameter (MwD) and geometric mean diameter (gMD). aggregate stability was also \ndetermined using simulated rainfall. the results show that using sewage sludge incorporated \nwith a rotary hoe improved the chemical fertility of the soil and produced more uniform \nsoil pore size distribution. leaving the land to develop secondary vegetation or turning it \n\nReceived for publication on October 2, 2014 and approved on June 26, 2015.\nDOI: 10.1590/01000683rbcs20140641   \n\n\n\nR.

These large-scale civil \nengineering projects promote soil compaction, \n\nprincipally within the layers closest to the surface. \nThe concomitant damage to the soil structure \nmay hampers the growth of plant root systems, \nand also reduces aeration and water infiltration. \nDecreased infiltration contributes to surface runoff, \nwith consequent dislodging and transport of soil \nparticles associated with fertilizers and organic \nmatter for example. This transport can occur in the \nform of aggregates and, or, as aqueous suspensions \n(Letey, 1985; Soane, 1990; Soane and Ouwerkerk, \n1995; Streck et al., 2004).\n\nThe anthropogenic actions which frequently \ncause the most severe degradation to soils \n\nover to pastureland produced an intermediate level of structural soil quality, and these two \ntreatments produced similar results. stripped soil without anthropic intervention was of the \nlowest quality, with the lowest values for cation exchange capacity (cec) and macroporosity, \nas well as the highest values of soil bulk density and percentage of aggregates with diameter \nsize&lt;0.50 mm, corroborated by its lower organic matter content. however, the percentage of \nlarger aggregates was higher in the native vegetation treatment, which boosted MwD and \ngMD values. therefore, assessment of some land use and management systems show that \neven decades after their implementation to mitigate the degenerative effects resulting from \nthe installation of the Hydroelectric Plant, more efficient approaches are still required to \nrecover the structural quality of the soil.\n\nKeywords: aggregate stability, soil compaction, stripped soil, soil quality.\n\nResuMo: ReCupeRa\u00e7\u00e3o de um LatossoLo degRadado peLa ImpLanta\u00e7\u00e3o \nde uma usIna HIdReL\u00e9tRICa\n\na retirada de espessas camadas de solo sob cerrado nativo da margem direita do rio paran\u00e1, em \nselv\u00edria, ms, para a constru\u00e7\u00e3o da usina Hidrel\u00e9trica de Ilha solteira, provocou degrada\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental, \ncom reflexos no processo de revegeta\u00e7\u00e3o do solo decapitado.

Mining activities \ncan completely alter the characteristics of the \nremaining substrate, including the soil particle \ncomposition of the soil (Espindola et al., 2000). \nSince the 1960s, the increasing demand for energy \nwithin Brazil has been met by expanding the \nnumber and generating capacity of hydroelectric \nplants. The construction of each new plant has \nbeen accompanied by the removal of thick layers \nof soil in the surrounding area. The magnitude \nand extent of the consequent impacts on the \nenvironment extend far beyond the time and space \nof the construction period and area. However, \nwhen the mantle is thick, as is the case with \nOxisols, it has proven possible to construct a new \nand fertile soil profile (Tavares Filho et al., 1999) \nin a relatively short period of time. This has been \nachieved through measures such as land leveling; \ncontrol of soil acidity; fertilization; cultivation \nof, for example, leguminous plants (Boni et al., \n1994) or eucalyptus associated with grasses after \napplication of sewage sludge (Colodro et al., 2007).\n\nSoil aggregates consist of assemblies and \nrearrangements of the primary soil particle \nfractions (sand, silt, and clay), and determine the \nsoil structure (Brady, 1989). Therefore, evaluation \nof the soil physical quality can be performed \nby considering the properties of its aggregates. \nAggregate development and modification are \ndependent on specific local circumstances, such that \naggregate characteristics are sensitive indicators of \nthe history of land use and soil management (Watts \nand Dexter, 1997; Tormena et al., 2008; Vezzani \nand Mielniczuk, 2011). In addition, chemical \nproperties, such as organic matter content, have \nbeen positively associated with macroaggregation \nin soils (De Gryze et al., 2008; Anders et al., 2010) \nand with soil structural quality (S\u00e1 et al., 2010). \nMonitoring of chemical properties may assists in \nunderstanding the mechanisms through which \nland mitigation may be achieved, for instance in \nrestoration of areas degraded by the installation of \nhydroelectric plants.\n\nT h e  h y p o t h e s i s  o f  t h i s  r e s e a r c h  i s  t h a t \nenvironmental mitigation techniques applied \nto the areas surrounding the Ilha Solteira \nHydroelectric Plant, SP, Brazil, provide the \nrecovery of degraded soil. The objective of the \npresent study was evaluation of soil chemical \nand physical quality in areas surrounding this \nhydroelectric plant. This was carried out through \nexamination of the soil under various land use \nand management systems that represent different \nlevels and periods of human intervention.\n\nMateRial anD MethoDs\n\nThe study was carried out on the Teaching and \nResearch Farm of Universidade Estadual Paulista, \nIlha Solteira, SP, Brazil, and is located within the \nmunicipality of Selv\u00edria, MS, on the right bank \nof the Paran\u00e1 River (51\u00ba 22\u2019 W, 20\u00ba 22\u2019 S) at an \naltitude of 355 m. The local climate type (K\u00f6ppen \nclassification scheme) is Aw, with average annual \nprecipitation of 1,300 mm. The relative humidity \nis from 60 to 80 % during the rainy months \n(October to March), and from 50 to 60 % in the \ndriest months. The average annual temperature \nfor the region is 23.7 \u00baC, with an average of 25.7 \u00baC \nfor the hottest months (January and February), \nfalling to 20.6 \u00baC in the coldest months (June and \nJuly) (Setzer, 1966).\n\nThe local topography is gently undulating to flat, \nwith the soil covered by native vegetation typical \nof the Cerrado. The original soil is an Oxisol (Soil \nSurvey Staff, 2010), corresponding to a Latossolo \nVermelho by the Brazilian classification system \n(Embrapa, 2006), of medium texture, and very deep \nand rich in Fe and Al oxyhydroxides (Dematt\u00ea, \n1980). In the early 1960s, part of the soil (from an \narea of 700 ha) was excavated to a depth of 6.0 m \nand taken to the embankment and foundations of \nthe Ilha Solteira Hydroelectric Power Plant, SP. The \nstripped soil exhibits part of the B horizon, and this \nhas remained exposed since 1969. An inspection in \n1992 found high levels of soil surface compaction \n(Bonini and Alves, 2011). However, in some areas, \nnatural regeneration in the form of rarefied and \nlow-growing vegetation has started and has been \nallowed to remain in this condition until the present \nstudy was conducted.\n\nIn 2003, the soil condition (stripped and hence \ndegraded, or undisturbed during the power plant \nconstruction) and vegetation (natural, pasture, \nnatural regeneration, or bare) of the land available \nfor the study around the Ilha Solteira Hydroelectric \nPlant were surveyed. Soil samples for analysis \nwere collected, in which there were 30 sampling \npoints (repetitions) within a 12 \u00d7 10 m plot per \ntreatment. Areas corresponding to four treatments \nwere delineated: SD, degraded stripped soil with \nan absence of spontaneous plants and without \nhuman interventions for land regeneration; SDCap, \nstripped soil upon which secondary scrub vegetation \n(capoeira) has developed since 1969 as a result of \nnatural regeneration; SNat, soil beneath the native \nvegetation of the Cerrado; and SPas, where the \nnative vegetation has been replaced by pasture. For \ntreatment SD, the B horizon has remained exposed \nsince 1969. A regeneration treatment, consisting of \nthe application of sewage sludge, followed by the \ncultivation of eucalyptus and grasses, was applied \nto randomly selected plots within the SD area, \nestablishing the fifth treatment: SDle.\n\n\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 39:1776-1785, 2015\n\n1779RecoveRy of an oxisol DegRaDeD by the constRuction of a hyDRoelectRic PoweR...\n\nThe conversion of part of the SD area to SDle \nwas through the following operations. A sequence of \ntwo subsoilings to a depth of 0.40 m was performed \nin January and February of 2003. In July 2003, the \nsewage sludge was applied in a single broadcast \noperation (rate: 60 Mg ha-1, dry weight basis). The \nsludge was first manually distributed over the \nsurface, and then incorporated to a depth of 0.10 m \nusing a rotary hoe. The sewage application rate \nwas defined after considering the rates adopted in \nvarious investigations of soil regeneration, such \nas those by Kitamura et al. (2008) and Colodro \nand Espindola (2006), which had previously been \nconducted in the same geographical region of Brazil \nas the present study. The sewage sludge, which \nwas predominantly of domestic origin and had been \nproduced by the extended aeration process, was \nobtained from the Sewage Treatment Plant operated \nby Sanear (Ara\u00e7atuba Sanitation Company S.A.) in \nAra\u00e7atuba, SP, Brazil. Chemical characterization of \nthe sludge was performed by Colodro and Espindola \n(2006), who determined that the concentrations \nof heavy metals in the sewage sludge met the \nlimits established by the principal national and \ninternational environmental monitoring agencies \n(Table 1). Microbiological characterization of \nthe sludge, performed by Modesto et al. (2009), \nindicated 0.04 eggs g-1 of total solids, for both \nprotozoa and helminths, satisfying the maximum \nlimit established by Cetesb (1999) and identifying \nthe sludge type as Class B. Correction of soil acidity \nwas performed with limestone, incorporated by \nlight harrowing, so that base saturation was raised \nto 60 %. In August 2003, the experimental plot was \nplanted to eucalyptus (eucalyptus citriodora) in a \n2.0 m between rows and 1.5 m between plants in \n0.40 m deep furrows. Seeds of the grass Brachiaria \ndecumbens were broadcast over the entire surface \nof the plot, with two objectives: to absorb the excess \nnitrate generated by the addition of the sewage \nsludge and to increase the organic matter content \nof the soil. The grass was not cut.\n\nFor treatment SPas, the substitution of native \nvegetation for pasture (Brachiaria decumbens) \nwas effected in 1978. Soil preparation consisted \nof heavy harrowing (large disc harrow) and light \nharrowing (leveling harrow). Liming to raise \nthe base saturation to 60 % and fertilization \nwere performed as part of the conversion to \npasture and during subsequent renovations of \nthe pasture. The animal stocking rate was 2.5 \nanimal units ha-1 yr-1.\n\nFor each treatment, soil particle distribution \nanalysis was conducted on a composite sample \nfrom the 0.00-0.20 m layer collected from a 30-point \ngrid. The maximum differences identified between \ntreatments (?48 g kg-1) for clay and total sand \ncontent were considered to be of low physical \nsignificance (Table 2).\n\nSoil sampling was performed in 2004. Chemical \ncharacterization was conducted on samples \ncollected from the 0.00-0.20 m layer, with the aim \nof assisting understanding of the evolution of the \nexperimental treatments since their inception, and \nfocused on parameters likely to affect the stability \nof aggregates. The methodology made available in \nRaij et al. (2001) was employed, with soil coming \nfrom 10 sampling points per treatment.\n\nDeterminations of soil bulk density (Blake \nand Hartge, 1986), and porosity (Camargo \net al., 2009), consisting of total, macro-, and \nmicroporosity (water content retained under \na  t e n s i o n  o f  6  k P a )  w e r e  p e r f o r m e d  w i t h \nundisturbed samples. These samples were taken \nfrom the 0.00-0.05 m layer in the designated plot \nfor each experimental treatment using 100 cm3 \nvolumetric rings. For each plot, the 30 sampling \npoints were on a square grid, with a distance of \n2 m between adjacent points.\n\nAnalysis of the stability of the soil aggregates in \nwater was performed according to methods outlined \nby Kemper and Chepil (1965). Sampling points were \nlocated on the previously established 30-point grid, \nand undisturbed soil samples were obtained from the \n0.00-0.20 m layer. In duplicate, 25 g of the air-dried \nsoil sample for each sampling point were passed \nthrough a set of sieves with mesh openings of 9.52, \n7.93, 6.35, 4.00, 2.00, 1.00, and 0.50 mm. From the \nsoil masses retained in the sieves, the distribution \nof the soil aggregates by size class was determined, \nfrom which mean weight diameter (MWD) and \ngeometric mean diameter (GMD) of the aggregates \nwere computed.\n\nAdditional stability testing was performed using \na rain simulator, operated under hydraulic loading \nconditions sufficient to maintain a constant rate of \nraindrop formation (Boyle-Mariotte principle), as \ndescribed by Roth et al. (1985). In duplicate, 3 g of \nthe air-dried soil sample for each sampling point, \nas previously mentioned, were kept under an \naverage precipitation rate of 60 mm h-1 for a period \nof 20 min; sieves were utilized to retain aggregates \no f  t h r e e  s i z e  c l a s s e s :  9 . 5 2 - 6 . 3 5 ,  9 . 5 2 - 4 . 0 0 , \nand 9.52-2.00 mm. The retained size-selected \naggregates were subsequently transferred to \naluminum crucibles with the aid of a wash bottle, \nand dried in an oven (105 \u00baC) to constant weight. \nFrom the dry weights determined, the percentages \nof aggregates which resisted the simulated rainfall \nwere obtained.\n\nThe experimental data were subjected to \nanalysis of normality (SAS, 2002) and were \ntransformed whenever necessary to achieve an \napproximately normal distribution. Mean values of \nsoil properties between treatments were compared \nusing the confidence intervals (95 %), according to \nPayton et al. (2000).\n\n\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 39:1776-1785, 2015\n\n1780 Joseane Carina Borges de Carvalho et al.\n\nResults anD Discussion\n\nChemical properties of the soil demonstrate \nthat for all the experimental treatments the pH \nremained in the acid range, with values&lt;5.0 \n(Table 3). The highest concentration of organic \nmatter (OM) was found in the soil under native \nvegetation, that is, Cerrado with no history of \nhuman interventions. The average OM content \n\ndid not differ significantly between the soil under \nnative vegetation and the soil now under pasture, \nshowing the positive effect of grasses on the \naccumulation of organic C in the soil.\n\nDegraded soil resulting from stripping which had \nexperienced no human interventions directed toward \nregeneration (treatment SD) was highly compacted \n(soil bulk density (Bd) = 1.92 Mg m-3) and displayed \nthe lowest content of organic matter, approximately \n12 % of the maximum observed value (soil under \nnative vegetation, SNat; Table 3). Soil from stripped \nareas where scrub vegetation (capoeira) appeared as \na result of natural regeneration reached an organic \nmatter content approximately half that of the soil \nunder natural vegetation (SNat) and under pasture \n(SPas). The determination of OM content for the \ndegraded soil to which sewage sludge was applied \n(SDle) showed that this treatment was effective \nin improving the condition of the degraded soil. \nRegeneration of the soil occurred, the organic matter \ncontent of the soil increased, and this made the \ncultivation of eucalyptus possible. The effectiveness \nof sewage sludge in the regeneration of degraded \nsoils has been verified in other investigations, such \nas Colodro and Espindola (2006).\n\nCation exchange capacity (CEC) values for the \nsoils of the different treatments followed, in general, \nthe same trend as observed for the organic matter \ncontent (Table 3). However, although the organic \nmatter content of the soil treated with sewage \nsludge (SDle) was approximately 40 % lower than \nfor the SNat and SPas soils, the SDle soil displayed \nthe highest mean CEC. An explanation for this \nobservation can be found in the presence of organic \nmatter in an amorphous state within the SDle soil; \nthis colloidal material has a significantly greater \nsurface area than for organic materials in a less \n\ntable 1. chemical and physical characterization of the \nsewage sludge, with maximum permitted limits\n\nattribute(1) observed value\n\nMaximum permitted \nlimit\n\ncetesb(3) usepa(4)\n\npH (in natura) 7.1\n\nMoisture (m3 m-3) 65.7\n\nVolatile solids (dag kg-1) 71.5\n\nOrganic carbon (g kg-1) 406.0\n\nAmmoniacal-N (g kg-1) 8.9\n\nNitrate-nitrite-N (g kg-1) 105.7\n\nTotal N (g kg-1) 57.1\n\nP (g kg-1) 27.7\n\nK (g kg-1) 8.4\n\nCa (g kg-1) 3.9\n\nMg (g kg-1) 3.3\n\nS (g kg-1) 3.0\n\nB (mg kg-1) 10.7\n\nCu (mg kg-1) 159.8 4,300.0 1,500.0\n\nFe (mg kg-1) 7,385.0\n\nMn (mg kg-1) 77.8\n\nZn (mg kg-1) 474.4 7,500.0 2,800.0\n\nMo (mg kg-1) ND(4) 75.0 18.0\n\nAl (mg kg-1) 4,968.0\n\nAs (mg kg-1) ND 75.0 41.0\n\nCd (mg kg-1) 1.6 85.0 39.0\n\nPb (mg kg-1) 28.7 840.0 300.0\n\nTotal Cr (mg kg-1) 20.4 - 1,200.0\n\nHg (mg kg-1) ND 57.0 17.0\n\nNi (mg kg-1) 18.1 420.0 420.0\n\nSe (mg kg-1) ND 100.0 36.0\n\nNa (mg kg-1) 1,255.0\n(1) Metals determined by ICP AES according to method SW3051 \nof the Usepa (Usepa, 1993).

With regard to the chemical fertility of the \nsoils, the SDle treatment led to large increases in \nthe levels of nutrients, especially P, Ca, and Mg, \nwith associated improvements in the sum of bases \n(SB) and the base saturation (V). The treatment \nalso offered control of Al toxicity to plants and of the \nacidity of the soil. Taken together, these observations \nserve to emphasize the importance of the type and \nthe quality of the OM applied in recovery programs \nfor degraded soils. These results are in agreement \nwith other investigations carried out in the same \ngeographical region as the present study, which \nevaluated soils treated with biosolids and cultivated \nwith corn and beans (Nascimento et al., 2004), and \nwith tree species (Modesto et al., 2009).\n\nFor the soil under the native vegetation of the \nCerrado, soil Bd = 1.19 Mg m-3 was consistent with \nits soil particle properties (Reichert et al., 2009) and \nthe absence of any agricultural use and management \n(Tables 2 and 3). The soil under capoeira, which \nwas regenerating naturally (SDCap), displayed a \nBd = 1.65 Mg m-3 very close to that observed for the \nsoil under pasture (SPas, Bd = 1.68 Mg m-3). This \nsimilarity in Bd and hence compaction reflects, in \n\npart, the history of the stresses applied to the soils \nof these treatments. There was regular traffic of \nheavy machinery over the SDCap soil during the \nconstruction period of the hydroelectric plant, while \nthe SPas soil was burdened by grazing livestock. \nExcluding the soil under native vegetation, the \nsoil from the SDle treatment exhibited the lowest \nBd (1.61 Mg m-3), an observation which may be \nattributed principally to the alleviation of compaction \nprovided during the incorporation of the broadcast \nsewage sludge. The most intense degradation was \nobserved where the soil had been stripped and there \nhad been no subsequent regeneration (treatment \nSD); this was evidenced by the high value for Bd of \n1.92 Mg m-3, which is a recognized consequence of \nthe occurrence of high accumulated strains on a soil.\n\nCompaction of the soil under the different \ntreatments compared to the soil under native \nvegetation, revealed by the changes in Bd, \ncompromised the total porosity (TP) of the soil, \nand was further reflected in decreases in the \nmacroporosity of the soil (Table 3). The TP of the \nSNat soil was greater than the upper value of \n0.50 m3 m-3 indicated as desirable for plant growth \n(Kiehl, 1979). The distribution of the TP between \nmicro- and macroporosity was most balanced for the \nsoil into which sewage sludge had been incorporated, \n\ntable 3. soil chemical and physical properties around the ilha solteira hydroelectric Plant, sP, \nbrazil.

For most of the \nevaluated treatments, the macroporosity exceeded \nthese minimum suggested values.\n\nIndications of the structural stability of the soils \nfrom the different treatments were obtained by \ncomparing the size distributions of the aggregates \n(percentages by dry weight within different size \nclasses) that were stable in water. The soils under \nthe SD and SDle treatments proved to be the least \nstructurally stable from the significantly (p<0.05) \ngreater proportions of aggregates smaller than \n0.50 mm for these soils in comparison to the other \ntreatments (Table 4). A higher proportion of small \naggregates is attributed to more facile fragmentation \nof larger aggregates; in the context of the present \nstudy, this may be explained by the history of the \nSD and SDle soils and especially the impact of \nextensive use of heavy earthmoving machinery \n(Oliveira et al., 2004) in the area surrounding the \nhydroelectric plant.\n\nComparing the proportions of aggregates \nstable in water among the different experimental \ntreatments, the values for the size classes \n9.52-7.93, 7.93-6.35, and 6.35-4.00 mm were \nlargest for the soil under native vegetation (Table \n4). For the treatments that underwent some \ndegree of human intervention, clear differences \namong the treatments were only detected in the \nproportions of stable aggregates with sizes&lt;6.35 \nmm. Considering the two smallest size classes, \n1.00-0.50 mm and&lt;0.50 mm, the percentages \n\nin these classes were smallest for SNat. For the \n2.00-1.00 mm class, the proportion for SNat was \nsubstantially smaller than for SDCap and SPas \nand not significantly different from the values \nfor SD and SDle. The predominance of larger, \nwater-stable aggregates in the soil under native \nvegetation in comparison to the other treatments \nwas attributed to the positive effect of organic C on \nthe stability of larger aggregates (Demarchi et al., \n2011; Costa J\u00fanior et al., 2012). These results \nare in accord with Bonini and Alves (2011), who \nconducted evaluations of the physical quality of \na previously exposed soil (B horizon remaining) \nin an experimental area similar to that of the \npresent study. In their study, the B horizon had \nbeen exposed by deep stripping, and the soil \nsubsequently was under 17 years of agricultural \nmanagement with green manure, limestone, \ngypsum, and forage grasses (Brachiaria).\n\nAmong the managed systems, the stability \nof aggregates with sizes larger than 6.35 mm \nfrom soil under pasture appeared to be no better \nthan for aggregates from the SDCap and SDle \ntreatments (Table 4). This was despite the higher \nlevel of organic matter in the SPas soil, which \nwas similar to the level in the soil under native \nvegetation (Table 3). This indicates that the soil \ncompaction produced by trampling of the ground \nby cattle masked the combined contributions \nto the aggregation afforded by the growth of \nroots of pasture grasses and the activity of \nsoil microorganisms and fauna (Haynes and \nBeare, 1997). The net result found for the SPas \ntreatment was a decrease in the percentage of \nthe macroaggregates found to be stable in water \n(Longo et al., 1999) compared to SNat. This \ndecrease in macroaggregate stability in a managed \nsystem is in accordance with findings from Horn \net al. (1995), who affirmed that compaction is one \n\ntable 4.

For each \nsize class, there was no difference in the percentage \nby weight of water-stable aggregates between the \nSDle and SD soils (Table 4). These contrasts with \nthe SDCap and SPas treatments, for which the \nproportions of aggregates in the smallest size \nclass (<0.5 mm) were much less than for the SD \nand SDle soils, with associated increases for the \nintermediate size classes. This apparent lack \nof improvement under the SDle treatment may \nhave been a consequence of the relatively short \ntime (one year) between the incorporation of the \nsewage sludge into the soil and the collection and \nevaluation of the soil samples. In comparison, \nthe other treatments had been under their \nrespective systems of management for decades. \nIt is recognized that the duration under which a \nsystem of use and management is operated has a \nprofound effect on the structural quality of the soil. \nA recognized phenomenon, which can be invoked \nto explain changes in aggregate stability, is age \nhardening, in which an increase in the internal \nresistance of the aggregates develops over time to \nthe extent that the connections between the solid \nparticles of an aggregate are preserved during \nthe period following the initial tillage of the soil \n(Utomo and Dexter, 1981).\n\nSignificantly higher (p<0.05) percentages of \nstable aggregates in the size classes from 9.52-\n7.93 to 6.35-4.00 mm for the soil under native \nvegetation were reflected in the mean weight \ndiameter (MWD) of the SNat aggregates, 4.74 mm, \nwhich was the highest value among the treatments \n(Table 4). Considering the remaining treatments, \nthe sequence of MWD values was SPas > SDCap \n> SDle = SD; this demonstrates the importance \nof plant cover in the recovery of degraded areas \n(Demarchi et al., 2011). The behavior of the values \nfor geometric mean diameter (GMD) was similar. \nThe GMD gives an estimate of the most frequently \noccurring size class in a soil. With the exception of \nthe SNat soil, the estimates were ?1.02 mm; while \nfor the soil under native vegetation, the estimate \nwas 3.5 times greater.\n\nFor soils displaying a high degree of compaction \nor where plant cover has only recently been \nestablished (Table 3), the aggregates are generally \nless resistant to the action of external forces (Horn \net al., 1995), such as the impact of water drops from \na mechanical rain simulator. These expectations \nwere confirmed by the tests of aggregate stability \nunder simulated rain for the treatments of the \npresent study. Thus, the SD and SDle treatments \nexhibited lower percentages of weight retained for \n\nthe three classes of aggregate size evaluated than \ndid the other three treatments (Table 5).\n\nThe results for the SPas, SDCap, and SNat \ntreatments reflected the positive effects of plant \ncover on soil structure. These three treatments \nbehaved as a single group, with no significant \ndifferences among them for any of the aggregate \nsize classes (Table 5). The tests of aggregate \nstability under rain for the size classes 9.52-6.35 \nand 9.52-4.00 mm divided the treatments into two \ngroups: (SDle = SD) &lt;(SDCap = SPas = SNat). \nHowever, for the size class 9.52-2.00 mm there \nwas differentiation between the SDle and SD \ntreatments, with division into three groups: SDle \n&lt;SD &lt;(SDCap = SPas = SNat). The placement of \nthe SDle treatment with the degraded soil SD on \nthe basis of the relative stability under simulated \nrain of different aggregate size classes was in \naccord with the aggregate size distribution results \nobtained by wet-sieving (Table 4). The soil of the \nSDle treatment had passed through tillage only \na year before the collection and testing of the soil \nsamples, so that the SDle aggregates were the \nleast age-hardened (Utomo and Dexter, 1981). \nThus, the rapid entrance of water into the soil \npores during the testing of the dry aggregates in \nthe rain simulator may have led to their rupture \n(Caron et al., 1996), thereby compromising the soil \nstructural stability.\n\ntable 5.

The incorporation of sewage sludge \nimproved the chemical fertility and total porosity \nof the soil; in addition, soil macroporosity was \nincreased and the distribution between macro- \nand microporosity became more similar to each \nother. The natural regeneration treatment with \ndevelopment of scrub vegetation (capoeira) and \nthe soil under pasture presented intermediate \nlevels of structural quality and a high degree of \nsimilarity in soil physical properties.\n\nAlterations in land use and management \ncaused effects on soil structure. These effects \nwere reflected with considerable sensitivity in \nthe stability of soil aggregates, especially when \nevaluated through size distributions following \nagitation in water.\n\nSize distributions of the water stable aggregates \nwere increasingly shifted towards smaller aggregates \nwith increased environmental degradation. Key \nfactors for improvement in the quality of aggregation \nare the input and residence time of organic matter \nin the soil.\n\nRefeRences\n\nAnders MM, Beck PA, Watkins BK, Gunter SA, Lusby KS, \nHubbell DS.
