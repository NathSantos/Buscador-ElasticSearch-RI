The highest abundance of dragonflies was recorded \nat 6:00 AM and 12:00 AM in wet and dry seasons, respectively. Anoxia was detected \nin wet season during the entire nycthemeral cycle, while in the dry season, the highest \nvariability in oxygen content was observed during sunlight. Canonical correspondence \nanalysis showed that the abundances of Telebasis and Erythemis were positively related \nto water electrical conductivity, temperature, and depth, while for Acanthagrion and \nTauriphila, abundance showed a positive relationship to water oxygen and pH.

Acta Limnologica Brasiliensia\n\n1. Introduction\n\nNycthemeral studies in tropical lakes are \nextremely important due to the high variability of \nchemical and physical characteristics of water, such \nas dissolved oxygen and temperature (Esteves\u00a0et\u00a0al., \n1988). Both water dissolved oxygen concentration \nand temperature directly affect the abundance \nof Odonata larvae. The amount of dissolved \noxygen in water affects the behavior, metabolism, \nand survival of Odonata larvae (Corbet, 1999; \nHofmann and Mason, 2005). Variations in oxygen \navailability in lacustrine (low oxygenation) and lotic \n(high oxygenation) environments determine the \ndiversity of Odonata species (Voshell and Simmons, \n1978; Corbet, 1999; Fulan\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 2008). Water \ntemperature also has an effect on the abundance \nand development of Odonata larvae (Lutz, 1974; \nWard, 1992; Corbet, 1999). Sites with high \ntemperatures, such as thermal springs, tend to \npresent low abundance and diversity of Odonata \nspecies (Corbet, 1999). However, when considering \naquatic insects, Odonata are characterized by a high \ntolerance to changes of surface water temperature \n(Kondratieff and Pyott, 1987; Cobert, 1999). The \nimportance of abiotic factors like water dissolved \noxygen and temperature for the presence of \nOdonata larvae near macrophytes was also shown \nfor a lake lateral to Paranapanema River, Brazil \n(Fulan and Henry, 2006). According to the authors, \nEnallagma, Homeura and Telebasis were highly \nsensitive to variations in dissolved water oxygen \nconcentration and temperature during the year. \nBesides environmental variables, biotic factors such \nas predation risk can also affect macroinvertebrate \ndistribution during the 24-hours period. Flecker \n(1992) recorded that Ephemeroptera larvae \npresented nocturnal habits to avoid predators such \nas fish, which are usually more active during the \nday. Odonata larvae are top predators and can feed \non a great diversity of macroinvertebrates (Corbet, \n1999). Nevertheless, Odonata larvae are also preyed \n\non by fish and can present different behaviors. \nDespite the significant effect of predation on \nOdonata larvae, the current investigation has been \nlimited to the effects of seasonal and nycthemeral \nvariations in the abiotic factors on aquatic insects.\n\nAccording to Corbet (1999), environmental \nvariables and biotic factors, as predation, had \nan important effect on Odonata larvae density. \nAs indicated before, a daily modification on \nenvironmental factors can occurred in distinct \nstations of the year. Thus, it should be expected \nthat Odonata larvae presented a response to \nenvironmental variables as it was mentionned in \nliterature. So, our paper intends to respond to the \nfollowing question: Can environmental factors, \nas oxygen and temperature, explain nictemeral \nvariation in Odonata larvae abundance in a tropical \nlake? \n\n2. Material and Methods\n\n2.1. The study area\n\nCavalos Lake, 23\u00b0 29\u2019 S and 48\u00b0 37\u2019 W, is located \nat the mouth zone of the Paranapanema River. \nIt flows into the Jurumirim Reservoir, located in \nS\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil (Figure 1). It is lateral and \nsuperficially isolated from the Paranapanema River, \nbut it may be affected by the river by underground \nwater exchange. In a 16-month study, Carmo \n(2007) showed that underground water flowed in \nthe river-lake direction during 64% of the time and \notherwise in the remaining period.\n\n2.2. Macrophyte and Odonata larva sampling\n\nThree great stands were selected in dry and \nwet seasons, according to the arrangement shown \nin Figure 1 (P1, P2, and P3). In each stand, only \none macrophyte sampling was carried out; thus \ntotaling three samples each for the wet and dry \nseasons. Macrophytes were sampled on a single day \n\nper\u00edodo seco a maior variabilidade de oxig\u00eanio foi observada durante o dia. A An\u00e1lise de \nCorrespond\u00eancia Can\u00f4nica mostrou que as abund\u00e2ncias de Telebasis e Erythemis foram \npositivamente correlacionadas com a condutividade el\u00e9trica, temperatura e profundidade, \nenquanto que Acanthagrion e Tauriphila mostraram correla\u00e7\u00e3o positiva com o oxig\u00eanio \ne com o pH. Portanto, foi observada uma vari\u00e2ncia na abund\u00e2ncia de Odonata com \ntemperatura, oxig\u00eanio, condutividade, pH e profundidade durante o per\u00edodo de 24 horas; \nConclus\u00f5es: N\u00f3s sugerimos que o melhor per\u00edodo de amostragem de larvas de Odonata \ndeve ser pela manh\u00e3, pois neste per\u00edodo registramos as maiores densidades nas esta\u00e7\u00f5es \nseca e chuvosa. Destacamos que os resultados deste trabalho devem ser interpretados com \ncautela devido ao baixo esfor\u00e7o amostral e reduzida resolu\u00e7\u00e3o taxon\u00f4mica.\n\nPalavras-chave: lagoa tropical, varia\u00e7\u00e3o nictemeral, Odonata, temperatura, oxig\u00eanio.\n\n\n\n2011, vol. 23, no. 1,  p. 23-29 Effects of daily changes in environmental factors... 25\n\ninserted below S. auriculata in the selected sites and \nthe plants with Odonata larvae were transferred to \nplastic bags. In the laboratory, Odonata larvae were \ncarefully removed by moving the plants in circular \nmovements in three buckets containing 8 and 4% \nformaldehyde, and water, respectively (Fulan and \nHenry, 2006). The content of each bucket was \nfiltered with a 0.25-mm mesh net sieve. Odonata \n\nat 6-hours intervals for 24 hours (at 12:00\u00a0 AM, \n6:00 AM, 12:00 PM and 6:00 PM) in dry and \nwet periods. The 6-hours interval corresponds to \nthe minimum time necessary to wash the plants \nand carry out physical and chemical analyses in \nlaboratory. Aquatic plants were sampled with a \n0.25-mm mesh net mounted on a 0.07-m2 square \nmetal frame. The sampling equipment was carefully \n\nFigure 1.

The highest abundances \nwere observed at 6:00 AM in wet season and at \n12:00\u00a0 AM in dry season. Telebasis presented the \nhighest frequency of occurrence, being observed \nin all sampling periods during the nycthemeral \ncycle and in both wet and dry seasons (Table 1). \nIn Table\u00a02, we can observe that the surface water \ndissolved oxygen concentration was zero in all \nperiods (except at 6:00 PM) of the wet season, \nwhile in the dry season, the highest dissolved \noxygen concentration (3.74 mg.L-1) was found at \n12:00 PM. The values of surface water temperature, \nelectric conductivity, and depth were higher in wet \nseason.\n\nThe CCA Monte Carlo test revealed that the \nfirst axis (F = 4.829, p &lt;0.02) and all the canonical \naxes together (F = 4.132, p &lt;0.02) were significant \nand represented relationships between abiotic \nand biological variables. The first and second axes \nexplained together 70.3% of the data variability \n(auto-values 0.579 and 0.124 for axes 1 and 2, \nrespectively).\n\nTelebasis, Erythemis and Acanthagrion presented \nsignificant correlations with axis 1, while Tauriphila \ndid with axes 1 and 2 (Table 3). Water dissolved \noxygen, temperature, electrical conductivity, \n\nlarvae retained on the sieve were preserved in 70% \nalcohol and identified using an identification key \n(Costa\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2004).\n\n2.3. Abiotic factors\n\nAt each site, abiotic factors were measured as \nfollows: air temperature by alcohol thermometer, \nsurface water temperature by Toho Dentam \nthermistor, dissolved oxygen by Golterman\u00a0 et\u00a0 al. \n(1978), pH by Micronal B-380 pHmeter, and \nelectric conductivity corrected to 25\u00a0 \u00b0C by \nGolterman\u00a0et\u00a0al. (1978).\n\n2.4. Data analysis\n\nCanonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of \nabiotic and biological data and sampling periods \nwas made using CANOCO program (Ter Braak \nand Smilauer, 2002). The significance level of the \nfirst two canonical axes was tested with the Monte \nCarlo test (499 permutations, p &lt;0.05) and the \nprobability of hazard distribution of data was \ndetermined. CCA data were log (y + 1) transformed \nfor performing CANOCO.\n\n3. Results\n\nOdonata larvae from six genera (Acanthagrion, \nCyanallagma, Telebasis, Erythemis, Erythrodiplax and \n\nTable 1.

Discussion\n\nDaily changes on environmental variables affect \nthe distribution of aquatic insects. In this paper, \nmore evidences were added showing the effects of \nenvironmental variables during the diurnal cycle \non Odonata larvae.\n\nIn aquatic ecosystems, oxygen availability is one \nof the limiting factors of the survival of insect larvae, \nsuch as Odonata (Gaufin\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 1974; Corbet, \n1999; Hoback and Stanley, 2001; Apodaca and \nChapman, 2004).

Predation risk of Odonata \nlarvae by fish must also be considered, since it \ndirectly affects the larval behavior. Carvalho\u00a0et\u00a0al. \n(2005) studied the monthly variation of fish \ncomposition and distribution in Cavalos Lake from \nJuly, 1998 to June, 1999. According to the authors, \n5481 individuals of four orders, Characiformes, \nSiluriformes, Gymnoformes, and Perciformes, were \ncaptured in the lake. Despite Cavalos Lake being a \nsmall and isolated lake, a significant density of fish \nthat inhabit this environment may prey on Odonata \nlarvae. Flecker (1992) observed in an experiment \nthat Ephemeroptera larvae are conditioned to search \nrefuge, including in the absence of predators. Also, \nBass (2004) recorded that in natural conditions, \nthe number of invertebrates recorded during the \nnocturnal period was approximately four times \nhigher than in the diurnal period, due to a lower \npredation risk at night. Similar to Bass\u2019 (2004) \nobservations, we found the highest number of \nlarvae at 12:00 AM (nocturnal period) in the dry \nseason. This observation shows that predation \ncan be a determinant of Odonata distribution. \nHowever, during the wet season, we recorded a very \nlow number of larvae. In this period, the abiotic \nfactors may have important effects on the Odonata \nlarvae distribution. In the wet season, we recorded \nanoxia on the water surface in all sampling periods \nand also an increase of more than 100% in water \nconductivity as compared with the dry season.\n\nAll the six Odonata genera (Acanthagrion, \nCyanallagma, Eryrhemis, Erythrodiplax, Tauriphila \nand Telebasis) described in this work had already \nbeen reported near macrophytes (Carvalho and \nNessimian, 1998; Fulan and Henry, 2006). \nHowever, despite sharing the same habitat, Odonata \nwere diversely affected by abiotic factors, the most \nimportant ones being water dissolved oxygen and \ntemperature. As their affects on the abundance \nof aquatic insects during the daily cycle is highly \nrelevant, the sampling period of Odonata must be \nreported. In future works, involving environmental \nmonitoring of Odonata larvae, we suggested that \nthe better sampling period must to be carried in \nthe morning , since that we recorded the highest \ndensities of both wet and dry stations at that hour. \nWe point out that our data must to be examined \n\ndissolved oxygen concentration, and Telebasis \nwas positively influenced by dissolved oxygen \n(Fulan\u00a0and Henry, 2006). Apparently, Acanthagrion, \nErythemis, Tauriphila, and Telebasis are thus more \nsusceptible to changes of oxygen availability during \nthe daily cycle rather than during the annual \ncycle. Although the changes of oxygen availability \naffected four of the six Odonata genera observed \nin this study, Cyanallagma and Erythrodiplax were \ntolerant enough of environmental variations, \nincluding of oxygen availability. Morphological, \nphysiological, and behavioral adaptations in low \nwater oxygenation conditions had already been \nobserved for macro-invertebrates (Hoback and \nStanley, 2001; Apodaca and Chapman, 2004).\n\nBesides oxygen, the surface water temperature \nalso influenced the distribution of Odonata larvae. \nOnly four orders of aquatic insects (Odonata, \nHemiptera, Diptera, and Coleoptera) are resistant \nto significant changes in water temperature (Corbet, \n1999). Odonata larvae tolerate changes in water \ntemperature through an enzymatic mechanism that \npromotes a fast physiological response (Schott\u00a0and \nBrusven, 1980). In the present study, only \nCyanallagma and Erythrodiplax tolerated variations \nin surface water temperature. Temperature changes \npositively affected Telebasis and Erythemis and \nnegatively affected Acanthagrion and Tauriphila. \nSome Anisoptera and Zygoptera families are \nsensitive to variations in water temperature, as was \nreported for Acanthagrion, Erythemis, Telebasis and \nTauriphila. (Corbet, 1999; Fulan and Henry, 2006).\n\nIn addition to the water dissolved oxygen \nconcentration and surface temperature, other \nenvironmental factors, such as electrical conductivity, \npH, and depth also had an effect on the abundance \nof Odonata larvae. CCA showed positive effects \nof electrical conductivity and depth on the \nabundance of Telebasis and Erythemis and of pH \non the abundances of Acanthagrion and Tauriphila. \nErythemis also showed a positive relationship \nwith electrical conductivity in a lake lateral to the \nParanapanema River, Brazil (Fulan and Henry, \n2006). Differently from what was observed in the \npresent work, Telebasis and Erythemis exhibited a \nnegative correlation with depth (Corbet, 1999). \nHigh pressure in sites with high depth directly \naffects the larvae tracheal system, reducing gas \nexchange (Corbet, 1999). Although depth can affect \nOdonata larvae negatively during the daily cycle, we \nrecorded a positive effect on Telebasis and Erythemis. \nWater pH, as well as depth, showed a positive effect \non the abundances of Acanthagrion and Tauriphila. \nZygoptera larvae, such as Acanthagrion., are actually \n\n\n\n2011, vol. 23, no. 1,  p. 23-29 Effects of daily changes in environmental factors... 29\n\nFLECKER, A.S. 1992.
