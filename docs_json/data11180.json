These two years of my MSc would not have been the same\n\nwithout his advising, help and encouragement to always pursue my goals. I feel truly thankful\n\nthat he took a leap of faith on me. It has been inspiring to work with you and to learn from\n\nyou and your constant teaching passion. Working with you for sure shaped the researcher that\n\nI will be, and for that I will always be thankful. Thanks for teaching me in several ways how\n\nnonlinear both science and life are.\n\nSecondly, a thanks to my parents who always stood strong no matter what and despite the\n\ndistance always encouraged me. For that I will always be thankful. This chapter in my life\n\nwould not be possible without their support.\n\nI deeply thank professor Wandrey Watanabe who gave a fundamental help in the most diffi-\n\ncult times of this work. Thank you for the helpful insights and precious suggestions. It was a\n\nprivilege to work and learn with you.\n\nI would like to thank the IO-USP professors Belmiro Castro, Paulo Polito and Olga Sato for\n\ntheir precious teaching. I proudly present myself as physical oceanographer today and a big\n\npart of that is because of you.\n\nI also thank professor Glenn Flierl for his precise insights and discussions. His help was\n\ncrucial to the development of this work and it was a privilege to discuss my findings with him.\n\nI am deeply thankful to my brother Nuno Almeida who through good and bad times, troughs\n\nand crests of happiness, was there for me. I could not be more thankful to you. You learned to\n\ncalm my spirit and to always have the right word to say. You\u2019re the best brother in the world.\n\nI am truly thankful to my labmates, Filipe Pereira, \u00c1gata Braga, Daniel Melo, Guido, Fabr\u00ed-\n\ncio Lapolli, Vadim Harlamov, Giuliana Lukine Tiago Bil\u00f3, Andr\u00e9 Pal\u00f3czy and Gilberto Watan-\n\nabe. Thank you for the coffee breaks and good talks.\n\nAlthough being labmates I am specially thankful to Pinguim (Dante Napolitano) and Patola\n\ni\n\n\n\n(Patr\u00edcia Baldasso) for being more than that and supporting me in a period that even I could not.\n\nPart of the tenacity that I had in this two years was because of your support and advices.\n\nI could not be more thankful to Iury Sousa who, although knowing me for only two years,\n\nbecame my younger brother on the other side of the ocean. Thank you for keeping up with my\n\ntemper and for being there through good and bad times.\n\nMy dear D\u00e9bora, there are not enough words to express how much I am thankful to have\n\nyou in my life. You made the problems seem small and easier to smile. Thank you for always\n\nsupporting me and believing in me even more than myself. Thanks for the help and support and\n\nthe laughs even after rough days.\n\nI would like to thank to Nancy, the nice Japanese who became a dear friend during these two\n\nyears. I am deeply thankful for the conversations and the coffee breaks and ginger in this final\n\nstage to relieve the stress.\n\nI also like to thank to my S\u00e3o Paulo friends Matheus Cortezi, Mariana Benites, M\u00e1rcio\n\nBorges, Dalton, Thiago Almeida, Guilherme Caneli, Ana Paula Loureiro, Aninha Losnak.\n\nA special thanks to Kamila and her family, Priscila Verlaine, Gui Bezerra, Shyveres, Hadassa,\n\nRosangela and Adauto.

You will always be my Brazilian family.\n\nI would like to thank to my friends in Portugal, Hugo Oliveira, In\u00eas Vaz, Tiago Pereira,\n\nEvelyn Santos, Diana Nunes, Cristiana Sengo, Am\u00e9rico Ribeiro, Juan Oliveira, Filipe T\u00e1rtaro,\n\nPedro Neves. Despite the distance and timezone they were always there for me during these\n\nyears. Always managed time to keep in touch and were there during good and bad moments.\n\nA special thanks to my professor and mentor professor Jo\u00e3o Miguel Dias who was always\n\nthere to talk about everything and any thought along the path. I also thank him for being the\n\nresponsible for my early passion for physical oceanography. I owe to him the early passion and\n\nwill to teach.\n\nI want to thank the Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro SA (PETROBRAS) for providing the CERES V data\n\nset. I also deeply thank Dr. Wellington Ceccopieri Belo coordinator and idealizer of the CERES\n\nproject and an enthusiastic responsible for the LaDO-PETROBRAS partnership and supported\n\nhigh-quality research.\n\nThanks to the Coordination of Improvement of Personal Higher Education (CAPES) that\n\nprovided the funding through the project \"Rede de Estudos da Corrente do Brasil na Margem\n\nContinental Sudeste-Sul (REMARSUL)\".\n\n\n\nLast but not least, because all the reasons above and even more, thanks Brazil.\n\n\n\nList of Figures\n\n1.1 Schematics of the surface circulation of the South Atlantic.

Its unique vertical structure makes this a different WBC in terms\n\nof velocity and transport. Although significant progress has been made over the last decade,\n\nthe BC system variability within the Santos Bight (SB, 23?S-28?S) is very poorly understood\n\ndespite its strategic role for Brazil in terms of energy. The BC thickens and changes its vertical\n\nstructure and dynamical modal composition as it crosses the SB. As it enters the bight by trying\n\nto contour Cape Frio (Cf, 23?S), the BC is about 500 m deep. As the current leaves the bight\n\nsouth of Cape Santa Marta (CSM, 28?S) it is 1300 m. These differences in thickness and ac-\n\ncompanying velocity vertical shear are due to the impinging branch of the intermediate South\n\nEquatorial Current (SEC) generating the so called Santos Bifurcation (SBi). We here investigate\n\nthe subinertial variability of the BC system within the SB primarily using satellite altimetry data\n\nand some traditional spectral analysis techniques. We also analyzed quasi-synoptic observations\n\nof an oceanographic cruise, which was part of the IOUSP-PETROBRAS CERES Experiment.\n\nWe identified that there are different phenomena occurring to the north and to the south of the\n\nbifurcation and this might be caused by the SBi feature itself and/or the consequential change in\n\nthe BC vertical structure downstream. North of the SBi, we detected oscillations with period of\n\n92 days and a wavelength of 490 km and which represent about a fifth of the BC variability at\n\n25?S. The 92-day oscillations are nonlinear vorticity waves, which are originated to the east of\n\n35?W and propagate zonally towards the BC axis. These waves then perturb the current exciting\n\noscillatory motions of the same period and which propagate downstream. South of the SBi axis\n\n(?28?S), we identified two different maxima in the ??k spectrum. They correspond to oscilla-\ntions with periods (wavelengths) of 68 and 148 days (397 km and 790 km). The longer wave is\n\nalso a baroclinic first-mode nonlinear vorticity waves propagating with westward phase speed\n\nof the nondispersive planetary Rossby waves of same period. They are originated in the ocean\n\ninterior and we were able to track its signal as far as 5?W. The 68-day waves has its existence\n\nxvi\n\n\n\nlimited to vicinities of the BC. Phase speeds have approximately the BC axis orientation and\n\nthey can only be clearly detected between ? 27?S and ? 32?S. This propagating signal accounts\nwith a variance of ?21% on the BC axis. Quasi-synoptic observations allowed the mapping of\na anticyclone and a cyclone of such waves. They seem to have modal composition very similar\n\nto the BC itself, which might provide additional evidence of local origin.\n\nKeywords: Brazil Current, Subinertial Variability, Vorticity Waves, Nondispersive Line, San-\n\ntos Bight.\n\nxvii\n\n\n\nResumo\n\nA Corrente do Brasil (CB) \u00e9 provavelmente a Corrente de Contorno Oeste (CCO) menos\n\nestudada dos oceanos mundiais. A sua estrutura vertical \u00fanica es faz dela uma CCO diferente\n\nem termos de velocidade e transporte. Apesar dos avan\u00e7os significativos na \u00faltima d\u00e9cada, a\n\nvariabilidade da CB na Bacia de Santos (BS, 23?S-28?S) ainda \u00e9 pouco conhecida, apesar do\n\npapel estrat\u00e9gico da regi\u00e3o na matriz energ\u00e9tica brasileira. A CB se espessa mudando a sua\n\nestrutura vertical e muda sua estrutura din\u00e2mica no dom\u00ednio da BS. Na regi\u00e3o de Cabo Frio\n\n(23?S) a corrente tem cerca de 500 m de profundidade. Ao sair da BS na regi\u00e3o do Cabo de\n\nSanta Marta (28?S) a corrente se estende at\u00e9 cerca de 1300 m. Estas varia\u00e7\u00f5es na espessura\n\nda corrente e consequente diferen\u00e7a no cisalhamento vertical de velocidade ocorrem devido \u00e0\n\npresen\u00e7a da Corrente Sul Equatorial em n\u00edvel intermedi\u00e1rio na regi\u00e3o gerando a Bifurca\u00e7\u00e3o\n\nde Santos (BiS). Neste trabalho investigamos a variabilidade subinercial da CB na Bacia de\n\nSantos usando primeiramente dado alim\u00e9trico e um conjunto de an\u00e1lise espectral. Foram depois\n\nestudados fen\u00f4menos geradores dessa variabilidade com dados quasi-sin\u00f3ticos do um cruzeiro\n\noceanogr\u00e1fico CERES V do conjunto IOUSP-PETROBRAS. Foram identificados fen\u00f4menos\n\ndiferentes no norte e sul da Bifurca\u00e7\u00e3o de Santos e esta diferen\u00e7a \u00e9 provavelmente devido \u00e0\n\npresen\u00e7a da bifurca\u00e7\u00e3o ou \u00e0 mudan\u00e7a que esta causa na estrutura da CB. Ao norte da BiS\n\nfoi identificada uma oscila\u00e7\u00e3o com per\u00edodo de 92 dias e comprimento de onda de 490 km\n\nexplicando um quinto da variabilidade da CB em 25?S. A oscila\u00e7\u00e3o de 92 dias est\u00e1 relacionada\n\ncom ondas de vorticidade n\u00e3o lineares originadas a leste da corrente em ?35?W e se propagam\nzonalmente at\u00e9 ao eixo da corrente. Estas ondas perturbam a corrente originando oscila\u00e7\u00f5es\n\ncom mesmo per\u00edodo e que propagam ao longo do eixo da corrente. Ao sul da BiS (?27?S)\nforam identificados dois m\u00e1ximos no espectro k ??. Os m\u00e1ximos correspondem a oscila\u00e7\u00f5es\ncom per\u00edodo (comprimento de onda) de 68 e 148 dias (397 e 790 km). A onda com maior\n\ncomprimento de onda \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m uma onda de vorticidade de primeiro modo barocl\u00ednico n\u00e3o\n\nlinear propagando para oeste com velocidade de fase de ondas de Rossby n\u00e3o dispersivas. Estas\n\nxviii\n\n\n\nondas s\u00e3o originadas no interior da bacia oce\u00e2nica e seu sinal foi identificado chegando at\u00e9\n\n5?W. A onda de 68 dias existe apenas no dom\u00ednio da CB. Esta onda propaga fase num eixo\n\naproximadamente paralelo \u00e0 CB e s\u00e3o detadas de forma clara apenas entre ? 27?S e ? 32?S.\nEsta onda explica uma vari\u00e2ncia da CB de ?21% ao longo do seu eixo. Observa\u00e7\u00f5es quasi-\nsin\u00f3ticas permitiram mapear um anticiclone e um ciclone associado a essa onda. Os v\u00f3rtices\n\naparentam uma estrutura modal muito semelhante \u00e0 da corrente.\n\nDescritores: Corrente do Brasil, Variabilidade Subinercial, Ondas de Vorticidades, Linha\n\nn\u00e3o dispersiva, Bacia de Santos.\n\nxix\n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Brazil Current (BC) is likely to be the least studied among of all the subtropical Western\n\nBoundary Currents (WBCs). While only in the last twenty years, a more thorough kinematic pic-\n\nture of its vertical structure along its poleward path has emerged from the literature, its dynamics\n\nis very much unknown. The first scientific article discussing possible dynamical mechanisms\n\nwhich would explain its vigorous meandering off Southeast Brazil was published only in 2008\n\n(Silveira et al., 2008). Moreover, most of the knowledge regarding the BC mesoscale variabil-\n\nity is restricted to the so-called \"two-cape region\" (22?S-24?S), which encompasses Cape S\u00e3o\n\nTom\u00e9 (CST), the Campos Bight and Cape Frio (CF).\n\nDue to its recent and growing relevance to Brazil\u2019s energy backbone, and of course, due\n\nto climate change understanding in the South Atlantic, the area corresponding to the Santos\n\nBasin (SB) continental margin should be explored in terms of the BC mesoscale variability as\n\nwell as the associated sources and triggers. The current thesis aims to describe how and at\n\nwhich time scales the BC meanders within the 23?S-30?S latitude range, as well as speculate\n\nabout the dynamics associated with such variabilities.\n\nThis initial chapter is organized as follows. In section 1.1, we overview the literature com-\n\nprising the BC mean pattern and its connection to the South Atlantic Subtropical Gyre (SASG). In\n\nsection 1.3, we revise the known mesoscale variability of the BC. We present thesis motivation\n\nand hypothesis, and the overall as well as the specific objectives in section 1.4.\n\n1\n\n\n\n1.1 Large Scale Circulation\n\n1.1.1 Description\n\nThe WBCs, which close the world ocean subtropical gyres, are probably among the most\n\nremarkable and studied large-scale features in Physical Oceanography. These currents are de-\n\nscribed as narrow jets (width of 100-150 km), which flow poleward and serve as ducts for trans-\n\nporting heat and salt from tropical to subtropical latitudes. Therefore, they play an important\n\nrole in regulating the climate and may influence the weather in such meridional range.\n\nFigure 1.1: Schematics of the surface circulation of the South Atlantic. Black solid lines rep-\nresent streamlines of the main currents and arrows represent the currents direction. The South\nAtlantic Subtropical Gyre (?10\u00b0S-40\u00b0S, red solid lines) is delimited by the South Equatorial\nCurrent (north), the Brazil Current (west) and South Atlantic Current (south). The gray shades\nindicate the major topographic features on the region. Adapted from Talley et al. (2011).\n\nThe BC is the Western Boundary Current (WBC) which closes the SASG (Figure 1.1). Obser-\n\nvations have consistently shown the BC as the weakest and shallowest (averaged over its entire\n\nsouthward path) current compared with other WBCs, such as the Gulf Stream (GS), the Kuroshio\n\nCurrent (KC), the East Australian Current (EAC), and the Agulhas Current (Talley et al., 2011).\n\nThe BC structure changes importantly with latitude, as the current thickens and increases its\n\n2\n\n\n\nvolume transport. The thickening of the BC along its path is due to the unique vertical struc-\n\nture of South Atlantic\u2019s South Equatorial Current (SEC). The SEC bifurcates at three different\n\nlatitudes as it impinges itself on Brazilian continental margin. As consequence of this SEC\n\n\"stratified\" bifurcation structure, the SASG diminishes in meridional extension with depth. The\n\ngyre is virtually 30? wide at surface and only about 12? at intermediate depths (600-1300 m).\n\nThe first (from north to south) of these three bifurcations (Figure 1.2) occurs at ? 14?S and\nis responsible for the origin of the BC itself. North of the Vit\u00f3ria-Trindade Ridge (VTR), the BC\n\nis basically a mixed-layer, no more than 200 m thick and transporting 2 Sv (1 Sv =106m3s?1) of\n\nTropical Water (TW) poleward (Soutelino et al., 2011, 2013). The second bifurcation occurs at\n\n? 20?S and thickens the BC to 500 m transporting also South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) in\naddition to TW. Its volume transport can reach 6-10 Sv and a vertical extent (Figure 1.2) which\n\nincludes the pycnocline (Campos et al., 1995; Silveira et al., 2004). The third and southermost\n\nbifurcation is commonly referred in the literature as the Santos Bifurcation (SBi), and occurs at\n\nintermediate levels between 25?S and 28?S (Boebel et al., 1999; Rodrigues et al., 2007; Legeais\n\net al., 2013; Rocha et al., 2014)(Figure 1.3).\n\nThis bifurcation decreases the vertical shear changing the BC from a almost purely baroclinic\n\njet (? 70% baroclinic) to a more barotropic (? 56% barotropic) (Rocha et al., 2014). South of\nSBi, the BC is present from the surface and to intermediate levels over the shelf break, continental\n\nslope and S\u00e3o Paulo Plateau. It flows poleward transporting TW, SACW, Antarctic Intermediate\n\nWater (AAIW) and Upper Circumpolar Deep Water (UCDW) up to more than 18 Sv (e.g., Zemba,\n\n1991; Stramma and England, 1999; M\u00e9mery et al., 2000). Beneath the BC system, there is\n\nthe Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) transports North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW)\n\nbordering the Brazilian continental rise and adjacent abyssal plain (e.g., Meinen et al., 2012;\n\nGarzoli et al., 2015) (Figure 1.2).\n\n3\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: The Brazil Current thickening along the Brazilian margin: (A) a three-dimensional\nsketch of the SEC and BC and the water masses being transported by both flow; (B) diagramatic\nrepresentation of the three SEC bifurcations, i.e. surface, pycnoclinic and intermediate. The\narrows represent poleward flow if pointing to the left or equatorward flow, if pointing to the\nright. Thicker arrows aim to represent the water mass at which the core of the BC, IWBC, NBUC\nand DWBC are found.\n\nThe BC separates from the margin at 38?S-40?S as it \"collides\" with the Malvinas Cur-\n\nrent (MC). Volume transport estimates from the literature are on the 30-46 Sv range poleward\n\n(Gordon and Greengrove, 1986; Rodrigues et al., 2010; Rocha et al., 2014; Schmid, 2014). De-\n\nspite the BC being weaker then the GS, Gordon and Greengrove (1986) identified that the growth\n\nrate of the BC transport along its path (? 5%) is similar to that of the other WBC.\nAs all southern hemisphere WBCs, the BC retroflects as it leaves the western boundary (Cam-\n\npos and Olson, 1991; da Silveira et al., 1999). This convoluted way of separating do not yield\n\nto a nearly zonal extension to the east of the detachment latitude, as observed in the GS or KC\n\n(Figure 1.4). Rather, the BC wraps itself on a large anticyclonic lobe and a zonally-damped sta-\n\ntionary wave pattern develops. The formation of the South Atlantic Current (SAC) occurs only\n\nto the west of the retroflection anticyclone. The SAC represents the southern border of the SASG\n\n4\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: The SBi structure as inferred from trajectories of ARGO floats to the SBi: (A): orig-\ninal ARGO trajectories with floats which veered to the north to join the IWBC are marked in\ngreen, and the ones which veered south to join the BC are marked in cyan. The few magenta tra-\njectories correspond to float immersions greater than 1050 dbar. (B): Averaged float velocities\nin 1?\u00d71? boxes. Blue arrows are averaged velocities less than 5 cm s?1, yellow arrows averaged\nvelocities greater 5 cm s?1. According to Legeais et al. (2013).\n\n(see Figure 1.1).\n\nThe retroflection lobe can be also interpreted as larger inner Recirculation Cell (RC) centered\n\nin ? 35?S. This RC is elliptical in shape and its northern border can reach as north 32?S. Its\nwestern border forms a counterflow to west of ? 53?W and which recirculates part of the BC\nre-entering the main current at the RC northern tip latitude (Gordon and Greengrove, 1986;\n\nStramma and England, 1999; Vianna et al., 2007; Schmid, 2014). The relative small size of\n\n5\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Schematic of the two patterns by which WBCs separate from the continental margins:\n(A) smooth separation and WBC extension formation. (B) reflection with a zonally-damped\nstationary wave formed. Adapted from da Silveira et al. (1999).\n\nthe RC has been attributed to a possible double-subgyre system proposed by Tsuchiya (1985)\n\n(from hydrography) and Vianna et al. (2007) (from altimetry and gravimetry): one centered in\n\nin ? 22?S and the other centered in ? 32?S (Tsuchiya, 1985; Belo, 2011). The RC described here\ncan be thought as the inner recirculation portion of the southern subgyre.\n\n1.1.2 Forcing\n\nThe WBCs are considered primarily wind-driven and usually extend from the surface to inter-\n\nmediate levels (Pedlosky, 2013). Their generation has been explained by numerous theories, as\n\nresponse to the wind stress and frictional forces (Sverdrup, 1947; Stommel, 1948; Munk, 1950;\n\nHughes and De Cuevas, 2001) or as a result of westward propagating planetary waves (Ander-\n\nson and Gill, 1975; Young and Rhines, 1982). Focusing on the viscous forcing hypotheses, all\n\nWBCs can be thought as the Sverdrup\u2019s return current to the wind-driven Sverdrup equatorward\n\nflow in the interior (i.e., away from the western boundary layer) of world ocean basins.\n\nHowever, the simple nature of Sverdrupian return current for the WBCs, which would point\n\nthe wind stress as the sole driving mechanism can be easily doubted by in situ observations\n\noceanwide. In particular, the meridionally-changing BC vertical structure presented in the pre-\n\nvious subsection illustrates that mass fluxes linked with what today is known as the MOC should\n\nbe considered as secondary forcing component as well.\n\nUsing the Atlantic Ocean as example, observations have shown that the transport of the\n\n6\n\n\n\nseparating GS is at least three times larger than that of the separating BC (Talley et al., 2011).\n\nHowever, there seems to be negligible differences between the strengths of North and South\n\nSubtropical High Pressure centers, which supposedly would suffice to explain the WBC genera-\n\ntion in both hemisphere. A first explanation for a stronger (weaker) and deeper (shallower) GS\n\n(BC) was presented by Stommel (1965). The author proposed that wind-driven and buoyancy-\n\ndriven (or thermohaline) components of the circulation add up (oppose each other) for the GS\n\n(BC) (Figure 1.5). The result of the combined forcing, as proposed by Stommel (1965), pre-\n\ndicted elegantly the BC between the VTR SEC bifurcation (? 20?S) and the SBi (? 25?S): a\nsurface boundary current transporting TW near-surface and SACW at pycnocline depths and a\n\ncounterflow at intermediate levels, the IWBC, transporting AAIW in all its domain and UCDW\n\nuntil it reaches the VTR at about 20?S (e.g., Stramma and England, 1999; Boebel et al., 1999;\n\nM\u00e9mery et al., 2000).\n\nFigure 1.5: Schematics of Stommel\u2019s explanation for a weaker and shallowed BC compared to\na stronger and deeper GS. The net volume transport budget includes the wind and buoyancy\ndriven flows. blue represents northward flow and red, southward flow. Adapted from Stommel\n(1965).\n\nThe simple thermohaline circulation box model first idealized by Stommel (1961) and used\n\nto build the conceptual model presented in Figure 1.5 does not suffice to explain what nowa-\n\ndays is known of the BC vertical structure from its origin to its separation from the margin. It\n\nis necessary to add complexity to the Meridional Overturnig Circulation (MOC) and show that\n\ndifferent water masses present distinct patterns of density-flux driven flow. Probably the most\n\ndetailed and complete MOC conceptual model is due to Schmitz (1995). As seen in Figure 1.6,\n\nthe proposed upper layer (i.e., the vertically averaged surface and pycnocline layers) and the\n\nintermediate layer MOC flow patterns, coming from the Indian Ocean, reach the Brazilian conti-\n\n7\n\n\n\nnental margin at different latitudes and, therefore, weaken the wind-driven BC unequally in the\n\nmeridional direction.\n\nFigure 1.6: The four-layer MOC global configuration proposed by Schmitz (1995).\n\nWe can certainly refine the Stommel (1961) for the combined wind and MOC forced BC\n\nbuilding upon the ideas of Schmitz (1995). We additionaly split the upper layer in surface\n\nand pycnoclinic layers to obtain the \"updated\" Stommel (1961) conceptual model for the BC\n\nvertical structure (Figure 1.7).\n\nFigure 1.7: The updated Stommel (1961) conceptual model for the BC vertical structure based\non combined wind and MOC forcings.\n\n8\n\n\n\n1.2 The Study Area\n\nOur study area (Figure 1.8) comprises the continental margin and abyssal plain adjacent\n\nto the SB, which is limited on the north by the CF (22?) and on the south by the Cape Santa\n\nMarta (CSM) (28?). In terms of mean flow patterns, the central portion of our investigated area\n\nis characterized by the SBi at intermediate levels, and which sets the IWBC origin site within our\n\narea. Therefore, the IWBC flows northward opposing a 600m-thick BC flowing southward on\n\nthe northern half of the area, while a 1300m-thick BC flows southward on the southern half of\n\nour domain. The DWBC supposedly flows south entire the whole domain (Meinen et al., 2012;\n\nGarzoli et al., 2015).\n\nFigure 1.8: The study area geographical limits and a schematic representation of mean large\nscale circulation within. The arrow colors represent distinct water masses being transported by\nthe flow regime: TW-SACW (red), AAIW-UCDW (green) and NADW (blue). Gray shades indicate\nthe major topographic features on the region.\n\nThe study area geomorphology deserves to be highlighted. The continental margin off CF\n\nabruptly changes from a nearly north-south orientation to a northeast-southwest orientation.\n\nAt southern end of the SB, in the vicinities of CSM, the continental margin orientation veers\n\nagain and acquires a more north-south display. These changes in margin orientation and in the\n\nsubsequent BC axis positions impose some relevant dynamical constraints in mesoscale activity\n\nwithin this region and which will be addressed next.\n\n9\n\n\n\nFigure 1.9: SST field for the SB at 14/08/2005 with the BC meandering from CST to CSM.

Quiver of geostrophic velocity\nfrom AVISO to the same day.\n\n1.3 The BC mesoscale variability\n\nBesides its complex and unique meridionally-changing vertical structure, the BC develops\n\nvigorous and rich mesoscale phenomena within out study region. We mean here by mesoscale\n\nactivity the occurrence of mesoscale meanders, eddies and rings of typically hundreds of kilo-\n\nmeters in length and of weeks to months in time. These kind of features have been reported by\n\nseveral authors along all the BC path (e.g., Garfield, 1990; Campos et al., 1995; Schmid et al.,\n\n1995; Silveira et al., 2008; Oliveira et al., 2009; Soutelino et al., 2013)(Figure 1.9). The BC\n\nmeandering in the SB has been described with hydrographic data, satellite data and numerical\n\nmodeling (Campos et al., 1995, 1996; Calado et al., 2008; Lorenzzetti et al., 2009). The rel-\n\nevance of the mesoscale phenomena to the regional biological system should be emphasized\n\n(Campos et al., 2000; Calado et al., 2010), as well as their importance to the operation of oil\n\nrigs and oil-gas exploitation in the pre-salt reservoirs.\n\nThe BC mesoscale dynamics only very recently started to be addressed (Silveira et al., 2008;\n\nMano et al., 2009; Rocha et al., 2014; Bil\u00f3, 2015). Silveira et al. (2008) were the first to focus\n\non the dynamical mechanisms responsible for generating the finite-amplitude meandering and\n\nring-shedding off the two-cape region. The authors used a current meter mooring at 22.7?S and\n\ndynamical mode decomposition to characterize the mean current as an essentially baroclinic\n\njet due to the system BC-IWBC. The first dynamical mode structure detected by the authors\n\nwere due to intense velocity vertical shear associated with the opposing jets. Using a quasi-\n\n10\n\n\n\ngeostrophic (QG) analytical model, Silveira et al. (2008) showed that baroclinic instability was\n\nthe primary mechanism for meander growth and found the most unstable waves with growth\n\nrates of about 0.06 days?1, wavelength about 266 km and virtually zero phase speeds (quasi-\n\nstationary waves).\n\nIn the attempt of further understand how the BC-IWBC system generates these unstable waves\n\nin SB, Fernandes et al. (2009) used and idealized two-layer shallow water numerical model.\n\nThey generated the horizontal velocity profiles of the local currents as two opposing Gaussian-\n\nshaped jets over a realistic bathymetry of the region. The authors obtained weakly unstable\n\nwaves, ? 0.02 day?1 growth rate, with 430 km and phase speed ? ?0.2 m s?1. These waves\ngrowth in amplitude between 20?S?25?S but decrease far south of 25?S (Figure 1.10). Their\nresults showed the most unstable waves propagating poleward, contrarily to those found by Sil-\n\nveira et al. (2008). The difference on the steering levels is probably mainly due to the simplified\n\nvertical structure in two layers.\n\nFigure 1.10: Instability wave propagation within the SBi as identified by Fernandes et al. (2009).\n\n11\n\n\n\nFigure 1.11: Linear baroclinic instability phase speed and growth for for MARLIM, C3, and\nW333 moorings: (A) growth rate and (B) phase speed. Source: Rocha et al. (2014)\n\nRocha et al. (2014) pursued the understanding of the baroclinic instability on different BC\n\nvertical structures north and south of the SBi employing four current meter mooring lines along\n\nthe current axis. The authors used a similar analytical approach to that used by Silveira et al.\n\n(2008) and found at 22.7?S unstable quasi-stationary waves just as Silveira et al. (2008) did.\n\nContrarily to the waves found at 22.7?, the waves at 25? and 28? presented significant phase\n\npropagation towards south (Figure 1.11). These authors identified the most unstable waves to\n\nbe shorter than those described by Fernandes et al. (2009) but with similar poleward phase\n\nspeed.\n\nMore recently, Bil\u00f3 (2015) studied the meandering of the BC at 23?S-30?S and found that\n\ndespite the baroclinic instability be responsible for draining the greatest part of the mean state\n\nkinetic energy, the most unstable perturbations are linked to barotropic instabilities. Using a\n\nlinear primitive equation (PE) model, the author found waves with higher growth rate than of\n\nthose found by Rocha et al. (2014), but similar phase speed, being ?0.19, ?0.24 and ?0.26 m\ns?1 at 24?S, 26?S and 30?S. The author also detected evidence of cyclonic meanders at ? 28?S\nusing satellite SST and chlorophyll-a data. The author estimated from satellite thermal imagery\n\nthe occurrence of 5 to 6 events per year of wave patterns with ?219 km of wavelength. Yet the\nauthors did not provide any insight regarding the dynamics of these cyclones and subsequent\n\nanticyclones. Nonetheless, they account for almost 55% of the BC subinertial variability in the\n\n12\n\n\n\nregion.\n\nThe studies listed above have studied the meandering of the BC and linked its possible driving\n\nmechanisms to the structure of the BC velocity shear and potential vorticity. All the authors have\n\ninvestigated the BC mesoscale variability as a response to local perturbations in the potential\n\nvorticity (PV) field either associated with topographic forcing or volume transport fluctuations.\n\nTherefore the possibility of remote sources perturbing the BC mean state has not been addressed\n\nso far. These perturbations can appear as a result of westward propagating features such as\n\ndispersive baroclinic planetary waves (Johns et al., 1990), the westward propagating Agulhas\n\nrings (Guerra, 2011; Azevedo et al., 2012) and nonlinear eddies or waves (Chelton et al., 2011)\n\nimpinging on the BC.\n\nAdditionally, the investigation of the BC dynamics regionally in the SB is restricted to Oliveira\n\net al. (2009) and Bil\u00f3 (2015). The former author used surface drifter data and the latter, thermal\n\nimagery and hydrographic survey data. However, nowadays altimetry data has increased its\n\nglobal coverage and have a spatial resolution that resolves wavelength of instability-like waves\n\nChaigneau et al. (2008). This quasi-synoptic dataset creates the opportunity of studying the BC\n\nmesoscale variability in larger domains such as this thesis study area.\n\n1.4 Thesis Hypothesis and Objectives\n\n1.4.1 Hypothesis\n\nTo date the BC variability within the SB has been only linked to either baroclinic or barotropic\n\ninstability processes and triggered by continental margin changes in orientation (Rocha et al.,\n\n2014; Bil\u00f3, 2015). Even tough the topographic forcing might account for part of the BC mean-\n\ndering, no study has examined so far the current variability caused by PV remote sources.\n\nThere have been studies recently showing the importance of westward propagating nonlinear\n\ncyclonic and anticyclonic eddies (Chelton et al., 2011). More recently, Polito and Sato (2015)\n\nproposed the co-existence of linear Rossby waves and nonlinear eddies and that eddies ride the\n\nwaves with both features propagating westward. The nonlinear eddy-planetary wave system\n\ncould transport a considerable amount of energy and enstrophy that could perturb in the BC\n\nmean field importantly.\n\nConsidering this knowledge gap on how the westward propagating features induce (or not)\n\nmesoscale variability in the BC, we aim to test the following hypothesis in this thesis:\n\n13\n\n\n\n\"The Brazil Current presents a relevant subinertial variability within the Santos Bight forced\n\nremotely by perturbations caused by westward propagating structures from the interior of the\n\nSouth Atlantic basin.\".\n\n1.4.2 Objectives\n\nThe general objective of this thesis is to investigate the remote forcing of the BC meandering\n\nwithin the SB. In order to reach this overall goal, the following specific objectives will be sought:\n\n\u2022 To characterize the spectral properties of the main variability features of the BC;\n\n\u2022 To characterize the origin and propagating direction of the perturbation sources;\n\n\u2022 To quantify the variance of the remotes sources inducing perturbations on the BC jet rela-\n\ntive to the total variance of the current system; and\n\n\u2022 To characterize the vertical structure and velocities of the perturbations.\n\nThis thesis is organized as follows. In chapter 2 we address the variability of the BC using\n\nits surface signal measured from satellite altimetry remote observations. In chapter 3 we seek\n\nto identify the features detected in the satellite data on in situ observational data from a hydro-\n\ngraphic cruise. In chapter 4, we summarize and conclude our findings. Furthermore this thesis\n\nends with recommended future work relating our findings and issues raised which are beyond\n\nour work scopus.\n\n14\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nMesoscale Variability from Satellite\n\nAltimetry\n\nIn this chapter, we study the mesoscale variability of the BC within the SB seeking for remote\n\nsources of perturbation of the BC axis. Nevertheless, we also search for local perturbation\n\nsources, which are probably related to either topographic forcing or jet transport fluctuations.\n\nHowever, we first must look for the dominant wave periods and wave lengths associated with\n\nthe meandering phenomena. Altimetry data is chosen to resolve the BC front and its deviations,\n\nand to conduct our analyses. We are fully aware that the capability of resolving fast and/or short\n\nduration phenomena is lost but, on the other hand, we do not have data gaps to deal with due to\n\nunfavorable atmospheric conditions (i.e. cloud coverage), such as in infrared based SST satellite\n\ndata .\n\n2.1 Datasets\n\n2.1.1 Altimetry\n\nThe altimetry time series extends from the beginning of 1994 to the end of 2015. The series\n\nconsists of a level 4 Absolute Dynamic Topography (ADT) global field, obtained from a multi-\n\nsatellite coverage (TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, Jason-2, ERS\u20131, ERS\u20132 e EnviSat). This image\n\ncomposite series used two type satellite coverage, the European satellites (ERS\u20131, ERS\u20132 e\n\nEnviSat) with ?35-day cycle and closer distance between tracks of ?85 km at the equator and\nthe Americans (TOPEX, Jason-1 e Jason-2) with a ?10-day cycle, but ?315 km along-track\n\n15\n\n\n\ndistance. The data set built by encompassing all satellite measurements is interpolated from\n\nonly two satellites, one European and one American, to keep the statistical accuracy. The two-\n\nsatellite data is interpolated to a daily and regular cartesian grid of 0.25?\u00d70.25? by Ssalto/Duacs1\n\nand provided by AVISO2.\n\nThe AVISO final products are expressed as ADT and SLA. The dynamic topography and the\n\nsea level deviations are related to each other by the hydrostatic equation:\n\n?(x , y, t ) = ??(x , y, t )\ng\n\n, (2.1)\n\nwhere ? is the SLA [in m] ?? is the geopotential anomaly [in m2 s?2] at surface level, and g ,\n\nthe effective gravity. We opt to employ the SLA throughout this work following the AVISO\n\nsite documentation and will use the terminology dynamical topography and sea level anomalies\n\ninterchangeably in the text. The data used, ADT, can be thought as the sum between a mean\n\nstate and its associated perturbations,\n\n?a (x , y, t ) = ?(x , y ) +?(x , y, t ), (2.2)\n\nbeing the ?(x , y ) the temporal mean dynamic topography, and ? its perturbations.\n\nAVISO provides besides ADT (?a ) data, a mean state (MDT) (?) field. The latest MDT version\n\nwas released in April 2014, and it was calculated with 20 years of data from 1993 to 2012.\n\nThis recent ? field better estimates the mean state of the ocean compared to the previous one\n\n(1993-1999), including long-term oscillations and accurate trend estimate of the sea level. The\n\nbackground dynamic topography computed from conventional hydrography and float profiling\n\nwas calculated relative 1500 m. The most recent ADT was also obtained keeping the spatial\n\nfilter constant in all grid points with a low pass filter that cut off wavelengths shorter than 65 km\n\nfor the whole globe (SSALTO/Duacs, 2014).\n\nAs the MDT provided by AVISO is a mean estimated with data until 2012, we needed to\n\ncorrect it using the remainder three year of altimetry data (from 2012-2015), and only after the\n\ncorrection applied, we calculated the SLA using Equation 2.2. Figure 2.1 show the comparison\n\nbetween the original and the corrected MDT as well as difference between both. It is observable\n\nthat the features in the mean field -as expected - are identical, the position of the BC axis is the\n\nsame but the values of the MDT based on the time mean of the ADT set presents an overall higher\n\nsurface height. We speculate that the differences in height are due to the sea level rise trend.\n1Segment Sol multimissions d\u2019 ALTim\u00e9trie, d\u2019Orbitographie et de localisation/Data Unification and Altimeter\n\nCombination System\n2Archiving, Validation and Interpretation of Satellite Ocean data\n\n16\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Comparison between the original AVISO MDT and the corrected MDT used in this\nwork.

This dataset comprehends 57 year of hydrographic data interpolated with\n\nobjective analysis to a 0.25? \u00d7 0.25? Cartesian grid with 102 depth levels. The Brunt\u2013V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4\nclimatological profile was calculated in one area in the basin interior (yellow box in Figure 2.2).\n\n17\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Study area, yellow box the region used to calculate the climatological Brunt\u2013V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4\nprofile. Gray shades indicate the major topographic features on the region.\n\n2.2 Methods\n\n2.2.1 Annual signal removal\n\nTo remove the annual signal and the seasonal oscillation of the data, we assumed that this\n\nannual signal behaves as a sinusoidal function. Then, we can approximate to each data point a\n\nfunction Y (t ), defined as\n\nY (t ) = A sin\n(\n2?\n\nt\n\nTa\n\n)\n+ B cos\n\n(\n2?\n\nt\n\nTa\n\n)\n, (2.3a)\n\nTa = 365, (2.3b)\n\nwith Ta and t units in days. After, the equation was adjusted to the data time series minimizing\n\nroot-mean-square error between data and Y (t )(Figure 2.3). Having this sinusoidal function to\n\nseasonal signal then the resultant signal results simply as the subtraction between the data and\n\nthe seasonal adjusted signal. Being the SLA data at one data point (x0, y0) and all time series\n\nSL A(x0, y0, t ), the data without the seasonal component will be N (x0, y0, t ) = SL A(x0, y0, t ) ?\nY (t ).\n\n18\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Example of annual signal adjustment for 5 years of data at one point in x-axis of the\nHovm\u00f6ller diagram. Green line D (t ) is the SLA signal and blue line Y (t ) the adjusted seasonal\nsignal.\n\n2.2.2 Fast Fourier Transform\n\nThe FFT technique is a computational algorithm to compute discrete Fourier Transform, a\n\nmathematical technique that decomposes a signal in its multiple complex harmonics. By doing\n\nso, one can convert a signal from its original time | space domain to a representation in the\nwavenumber | frequency domain. In this work we used two types of FFT, the two dimensional\nFast Fourier Transform (FFT2D) and the one dimensional FFT.\n\nThe FFT2D is a two dimensional approach when the original signal is converted from a time-\n\nspace domain to a wavenumber-frequency domain. This spectral technique gives as result a\n\nwavenumber-frequency (k ??) energy spectrum. In the present study we used this technique to\ndetermine the two spectral properties of the studied phenomena, wavenumber and frequency.\n\nFrequency determination\n\nTo identify the periods of the main variability phenomena we used the FFT2D of the auto-\n\ncorrelation matrix of the data. The autocorrelation of the data removes random noisy signals\n\nwithout losing the important spectral information. The main frequencies were identified by ap-\n\nplying a bandpass filter to the k ?? spectrum of the autocorrelation with the following criteria:\n\n1. Negative wavenumber and positive frequency, to select only south propagation features;\n\n19\n\n\n\n2. Frequency higher than 0.0349 day?1, separation between mesoscale and large-scale;\n\n3. Frequency lower than 0.3141 day?1, nyquist frequency of data aquisition;\n\n4. Wavenumber higher than nyquist wavenumber to remove non-propagating features;\n\n5. Wavenumber lower than 0.0896 km?1, the mesoscale detection limit using AVISO data\n\n(Chaigneau et al., 2008).\n\nHaving only the portion of the spectrum considered with this criteria we did a mean spectral\n\npower with all wavenumber to each frequency. Therefore we calculate which is the mean energy\n\nat every frequency considering all wavenumber inside the bandpass filter. This gives the peak\n\nof frequency that are more important disregarding the wavenumber.\n\nWavenumber determination\n\nTo determine the wavenumber we considered each period maxima separately. We performed\n\nthe FFT2D of the data and to each period (T ) we used a bandpass filter with a range of T of\n\n\u00b110%. This filter, for any given T, considered the follow criteria:\n\n1. Negative wavenumber and positive frequency, to select only south propagation features;\n\n2. Frequency higher than 2?1.1T day\n?1;\n\n3. Frequency lower than 2?0.9T day\n?1;\n\n4. Wavenumber higher than nyquist wavenumber to remove non-propagating features;\n\n5. Wavenumber lowerer than 0.0896 km?1, the mesoscale detection limit using AVISO data\n\n(Chaigneau et al., 2008).\n\nHaving the filtered spectrum we calculated the mean power spectral of every wavenumber.\n\nThis results in a one dimensional wavenumber spectra with higher values of energy in the most\n\nimportant wavenumbers linked to period T .\n\nOne dimensional FFT\n\nTo calculations used in the present study (i.e., correlation field) we needed the three di-\n\nmensional ? data filtered in the time domain. Therefore we also used in this work the one\n\n20\n\n\n\ndimensional FFT. In order to do that we used the FFT to transform a array of ? from the time\n\ndomain to the period domain. To the period spectrum we applied a bandpass filter in the period\n\ndomain centered in the target period T with a range of \u00b110% (Figure 2.4). After determining\nthe band of period we used the inverse FFT to reconstruct the data with phenomena only in the\n\ntime range of interest.\n\nWith the three dimensional SL A(x , y, t ) field, for each point in space, the time series of SLA\n\nwas filtered with the one dimensional FFT as already explained.\n\nFigure 2.4: FFT band-pass filter on SLA time series for the grid point at 25.375?S and 44.375?W\nfor the first 5 years of data. (A): blue line is the raw data, green line the data filtered with\nFFT. (B): red line is the spectral power [m2 day?1], yellow dashed line is in the 92 day period\nposition, black dashed lines the limits of 10% from central period and shaded black area is the\nportion of the spectre line used to reconstruct the filtered data.\n\n2.2.3 Correlation field\n\nConsidering a three dimensional field of SLA it is possible to determine the presence of a\n\nwave based on the correlation coefficient. This coefficient correlation was calculated between\n\nthe time series of a point where the wave signal is present and the time series at all spatial grid\n\npoints.\n\nConsidering a test fictitious SLA signal (upper Figure 2.5) with 400 km wavelength and 70\n\ndays of period happening at a restricted region of the SLA field and the remain signal as random\n\nnoise. Using the correlation coefficient with the point of control in the region where the wave is\n\npresent we identify troughs and crests of correlation with same wavelength of the troughs and\n\n21\n\n\n\ncrest of SLA. Therefore this method is useful to determine the regions where there is signal of\n\nthe wave and thus its wavelength. Moreover when using this technique to a point in the field\n\nwhere there is not the presence of the wave the correlation is nearlly zero for every grid-point\n\nexcept the control (lower panel in Figure 2.5).\n\nOne important thing to this method is the amplitude of the noise signal compared to the\n\namplitude of the wave signal. To ensure this we used in this method the data previously fil-\n\ntered according to section 2.2.2. Moreover we performed a Monte-Carlo statistical test to study\n\nthe statistical significance of the correlation. The grid points with correlation lower than the\n\nstatistical significance value were interpreted as zero.\n\nFigure 2.5: Example of the pathway and wavelength estimate using the SLA correlation coef-\nficient field.

(C): orrelation field with a\ncontrol point where there is no presence of the wave, magenta dot the position of control time\nseries.\n\n22\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Radon Transform\n\nThe phase speed of the propagating signal in the filtered data were calculated via Radon\n\ntransform. Radon space is given for a radius (r ) and angle (?)(Figure 2.6). So the projection of\n\na function in r with the angle ? is a radon transform\n\n?{h}(r,?) =\n? ??\n??\n\nh(x?, t ?)d s. (2.4a)\n\nx? = r cos?? s sin? (2.4b)\n\nt ? = r sin?? s cos? (2.4c)\n\nwhere, ?{h} is the transform of one arbitrary function h and r and ? the distance and angle\nof the Radon space. This method is used to estimate the phase speed of propagating signal when\n\none considers the Hovm\u00f6ller diagram of the data as the h function. In this sense the function\n\nis rotated for ??/2 &lt;? &lt;?/2 and for each angle the sum is made along the r -axis. When ? is\nsuch that the troughs and crests are aligned with y-axis and perpendicular to r -axis, the variance\n\nof the sums has a maximum. The phase speed can be inferred from ?, since tan(?) = ?t\n?x .\n\nFigure 2.6: Radon transform illustrative scheme. The gray square represent the original data\nbeing rotated. Blue dashed line represent a relative sum of the radon space at each angle for all\nr axis, being the angles 0?, 45? and 67.5?.\n\n2.2.5 Explained variance\n\nConsidering a time series of SLA (?) and the data filtered in some temporal band (?f ) it is\n\npossible to calculate how much the filtered explains of the total variance of the original data.\n\nThe explained variance of the original is given by\n\n23\n\n\n\nv f = 1 ?\n?(???f )2\n?(?)2\n\n, (2.5)\n\nwhere ?f is the SLA filtered in time.\n\n2.3 Results and Discussion\n\nAs stated before, the primary goal of this work is to study the remote sources of subinertial\n\nvariability of the BC and how they account for the meandering of the jet within the SB.\n\nConsidering a QG framework one can recall that\n\n? = g\nf0\n?a (2.6)\n\nand considering that ? can be represented as\n\n?(x , y, t ) = ?(x , y ) +??(x , y, t ), (2.7)\n\nthe sum of the mean state and the time dependent perturbations, then considering the previous\n\ntwo equations and Equation 2.1,\n\n?? = g\nf0\n?. (2.8)\n\nAccording to the previous equation the perturbations of the QG streamfunction can be esti-\n\nmated from SLA altimetry field. One technique to present such data and well known to study\n\npropagating phenomena is the spatio-temporal diagram, also known as Hovm\u00f6ller diagram. To\n\nmake this diagram, a path has been chosen taking in consideration the mean position of the BC\n\n(Figure 2.7). This is defined as the region near the BC with maximum ??.\nNonetheless, the path chosen and hereafter considered as the BC-axis, was not along the\n\nexact center of the current axis, rather it was dislocated approximately 36 km towards offshore.\n\nThis was done because the perturbations do not occur exactly along the current axis. Instead,\n\nthe current usually changes its core position towards offshore as it meanders. Moreover, some\n\nof the perturbations seem to propagate along the BC but not centered in its axis, instead they\n\npropagate attached to the current and centered further offshore.\n\nThe Hovm\u00f6ller diagram path chosen to study the variability of the BC starts south of Patos\n\nLagoon (? 33?S) and ends near Cape Frio (? 23?S). One important process within the SB is the\n\n24\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Mean Dynamic Topography map with filled contours as height in meters. The green\nline is the path along the BCaxis chosen to do the Hovm\u00f6ller diagram, starting at the green dot\nand ending at the red dot, the black dot indicates the mean latitude of the SBi along the green\nline (Rocha et al., 2014).\n\nSBi, both its importance and dynamical constraints it imposes have been discussed in section 1.3.\n\nTherefore we used its approximate position (black dot in Figure 2.1) and studied the region north\n\nand south of the SBi independently.\n\nThe ? for the chosen path was interpolated from the altimetry data. Its seasonal cycle and\n\nlinear trend have been removed in order to filter out anomalies that are related to annual oscil-\n\nlations and long time trend of the current (subsection 2.2.1). The SLA field in the SB presents\n\nsignal of southwestward propagation along the BC axis (Figure 2.8). This propagation occurs\n\nduring the 22 years of data but is not constant in time nor in space. Although there is an alter-\n\nnating pattern of maxima and minima of ?, the time mean of the propagation features changes\n\nits mean values during the time series (i.e. difference between 1998-2001 and 2001-2004). This\n\nprocess can be related to decadal or secular oscillation and is not relevant to the present study.\n\nBesides the identified propagation pattern, when looking closer one can also note southward\n\npropagation in a broader band of frequency. By looking to a smaller period of data, there seems\n\nto happen a time modulation of the SBi position. This modulation occurs in the Hovm\u00f6ller\n\ndiagram as a discontinuity of SLA that interrupt the propagation signal. This local maximum\n\n25\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Hovm\u00f6ller diagram of SLA after removed the trend and yearly signal. A) Hovm\u00f6ller\ndiagram of data time series between 1994 and 2016, black triangles represent the position of the\nSBi in the Hovm\u00f6ller diagram. Black dashed lane represent area subseted. B) subset of panel A\nwith day zero as 1s t of January of 2007 and ending in 1s t of January of 2010, black triangles\nindicate the position of the SBi\n\nchanges its position with time, in early 2007 it was centered at ?1200 km of distance from\nsouthernmost point, and between early 2008 and the end of 2010 it shifted to a smaller distance\n\n(?900 km) therefore to south. This is probably the SBi surface signal and the interruptions\nis due to its presence at intermediate levels. The difference in distance along the Hovm\u00f6ller\n\ndiagram axis represents a variation of 2?, then this changing in position of the abovementioned\n\ndiscontinuity is presumably linked to the long-term variability of the SBi latitude.\n\nGiven the regional importance of the SBi and the apparent discontinuity in propagation here-\n\nafter the spectral analysis will be applied in two different areas:\n\n\u2022 North of the Santos Bifurcation;\n\n\u2022 South of the Santos Bifurcation.\n\n26\n\n\n\n2.3.1 North of the Santos Bifurcation\n\nTo the north of the bifurcation the frequency mean spectrum presents an energy peak in the\n\nperiod of 92 days (red dot) and two secondary peaks both at around 170 days Figure 2.9. The\n\nrest of the energy is almost restricted to periods between 90 and 125 days with no significant\n\nsignal to periods smaller than 80 days. The second and third maximum values are in 160 and 175\n\ndays. (Mata et al., 2006) estimated the limit between low-frequency and mesoscale variability\n\nto be of about 170 days. Therefore, since the second and third maximum are either out or in the\n\nlimit of mesoscale variability band, these periods were not addressed in this study. At the north\n\nof the SBi there is a maximum of mesoscale variability with 92 days of period, and this is the\n\npeak that we will study. Hereafter this peak will be mentioned as 92-D.\n\nFigure 2.9: Spectral mean energy [m2 day?1] for periods between 20 and 180 days, computed\nto the north of the SBi. Red dot the period of maximum energy.\n\nTo determine the wavenumber linked to the variability of 92-D signal we used the method\n\npresented in section 2.2.2. The mean spectrum increases towards a maximum of energy in -\n\n0.012 km?1 (red dot) and decreases after this value (Figure 2.10). To wavenumbers lower than\n\n-0.020 km?1 the spectrum value is lower than a third of the maximum value. However, this\n\nspectrum has a striking limitation in this band of wavenumber. Thus, due to data resolution,\n\nthe wavenumber peak linket to 92-D phenomena is centered in -0.012\u00b10.002 km?1. This range\nof wavenumber represents a 180 km range of wavelengths and this effect is enhanced given the\n\nproximity to minimum wavenumber resolution.\n\n27\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: Spectral determination of most important wavenumber. (A) Spectral energy of\nthe Hovm\u00f6ller diagram [Lo g 10 m2 day?1 km?1]. Blue line the bandpass filter box centered\nin period of 92 days and range of \u00b110%. (B) Wavenumber spectrum [m2 km?1], black dots\nrepresent spectral resolution and red dot dominant wavenumber.\n\nThe main mesoscale variability of the BC at the north of the SBi have a characteristic period\n\nof 92 days and wavelength of ?513 km. Moreover the signal propagates southwestward, with\nsignal along the BC axis. However information is needed to its origin site and propagation\n\npathway towards the current.\n\nIn order to analyze the propagation pathway through which the 92-D signal reaches the BC we\n\nused the methodology explained in subsection 2.2.3. To study only the important signal we first\n\nfiltered the SLA data in the time domain with a tophat band-pass filter using one dimensional\n\nFFT as described in section 2.2.2. This ensures that we remove propagation related to others\n\nfrequencies rather than 92-D signal. Nonetheless this method is solely a time domain filtering\n\nand does not carries spatial information as the wavenumber has been already determined.\n\nThis correlation field shows an almost zonal westward propagation reaching the BC to the\n\nnorth of the SBi along ? 25?S. Meridional elongated bands of correlation (i.e 32.5?W) are ev-\nident in the 92-D signal correlation field, which suggests a propagation as a wave front rather\n\nthan a sequence of cyclones and anticyclones. This elongated fronts are restricted to latitudes\n\nbetween 23?S and 33?S.\n\nZhang et al. (2001) using a current meter mooring and satellite altimetry data identified a\n\nmaximum mesoscale variability of 100 days to the KC south of Taiwan. The authors identified\n\n28\n\n\n\nthe source of this variability to be westward propagating eddies. However they did not found\n\nphase propagation along the current, instead they identified this 100 day signal to be the main\n\nsource of variability in the KC transport. The authors identified this variability to be caused by\n\nbarotropic isntabilities. Due to the instabilities the current shift its axis and flows through a\n\ndifferent path. Chen et al. (2009) studied the KC near South China Sea with a longer time series\n\nof altimetry data and identified the main mesoscale variability to be 94 days. Therefore both\n\nauthors looked to the same source of variability, given the 6 days difference. The variability\n\nsignal of the BC has a close period to the one found for the KC. However it does not seem to be\n\nas eddies reaching the current but a westward propagating wave front.\n\nThe path defined based on the BC axis (black line in Figure 2.11A) is almost in southwest-\n\nward direction and the 92-D signal has a westward propagation direction. This difference in the\n\norientation between both causes the northern part of the troughs and crests to reach the BC first.\n\nTherefore the arrival of a westward propagation wave can cause an apparent phase propagation\n\nalong the BC. Nonetheless it appears to exist an actual phase propagation along the BC with a\n\nsmall tough and crest along the BC. This can be either be propagation along the current or the\n\nwave front reaching the BC near CSM.\n\nUsing the technique in subsection 2.2.3 it is possible to estimate both the origin and the\n\nwavelength of the wave by analyzing the correlation field of the time series of each spatial\n\npoint (Figure 2.11A). The estimated wavelength for the 92-D is 520 km and its origin seems\n\nto be around 35?W. In addition to the origin site, this technique allows us to estimate a better\n\npropagation path of the wave. This improved path is then used to make a Hovm\u00f6ller diagram\n\nusing the same methodology applied to the BC axis case. As previously described, the annual\n\nsignal of the SLA has been removed and the wavelength of the 92-D is estimated with better\n\naccuracy, as explained in section 2.2.2.\n\n29\n\n\n\nFigure 2.11: Correlation coefficient field of the SLA filtered data in to 92-D signal. (A): map\nof correlation coefficient, green dot the position used to correlate with the rest of the field and\nblack line the Hovm\u00f6ller diagram path used for the BC axis. (B): same correlation coefficient\nfield, black line the new Hovm\u00f6ller diagram path specific to this wave, green dot is the start and\nred cross the end of the path.\n\nThe wavenumber spectrum along the 92-D path yields again a single maximum, at wavenum-\n\nber -0.01235 km?1 (508 km wavelength), and the spectral energy is negligible to features smaller\n\nthan 205 km (Figure 2.12). The correlation field pathway is small, only two full wavelengths.\n\nA possible explanation for this is that the wave exists only near the current. Due to the small\n\npath chosen the wavenumber of maximum energy is near the limit of spectral resolution.\n\nThe frequency, wavenumber and pathway of the main BC variability source at north of the SBi\n\nhave been estimated. With these spectral information, we applied a FIR2D filter in the Hovm\u00f6ller\n\ndiagram along the wave pathway. This type of filter preserves only the signal of a specific wave\n\n(Polito and Liu, 2003).\n\nBoth the original 92-D Hovm\u00f6ller diagram (zonal) and the filtered one present a westward\n\npropagating signal Figure 2.13. In the filtered Hovm\u00f6ller diagram it is observable that 92-D\n\nsignal vanishes (i.e., between days 1600 and 1800 in Figure 2.13). This absence of significant\n\nsignal of 92-D wave in the Hovm\u00f6ller diagram can be either because we are looking at a inter-\n\nmittent phenomena or it reaches the SB at different latitudes with time. In the last case we do not\n\nsample the 92-D in this Hovm\u00f6ller diagram but it is propagating towards the BC at latitudes be-\n\n30\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12: Same as the Figure 2.10 but for the new Hovm\u00f6ller diagram path in Figure 2.11A.\n\ntween 23?S-33?S other than 25?S. Having the filtered Hovm\u00f6ller diagram to the 92-D pathway\n\nwe estimated phase speed with the Radon transform method as described in subsection 2.2.4.\n\nHaving the phase speed we calculated an improved and more accurate wavelength of this wave,\n\n491 km.\n\nAlthough not being permanent in the filtered Hovm\u00f6ller diagram the 92-D wave accounts\n\nfor a variance of the SLA in its pathway of 21% (see subsection 2.2.5). However, in the BC axis\n\nthe 92-D signal explains 17% of the total variance. Even though we have other features along\n\nthe 25?S zonal line the 92-D wave accounts for one fifth of the its variance.\n\n31\n\n\n\nFigure 2.13: Hovm\u00f6ller diagram for the last six years of data (2009-2015). (A) SLA Hovm\u00f6ller\ndiagram for the path defined in Figure 2.11. (B) Filtered Hovm\u00f6ller diagram using FIR2D with\nthe period and wavelength of 92-D.\n\n2.3.2 South of the Santos Bifurcation\n\nVariability to the south of the SBi was studied by using the same methodology employed to\n\nthe north of the SBi.\n\nThe frequency spectrum was calculated with the methodology described in section 2.2.2. The\n\nspectrum has higher values of energy to the south of the SBi than to the north (Figure 2.14). The\n\nmaximum value in the south has a mean spectral power of 80 m2day?1, while the maximum\n\nat north has only ?33 m2day?1. Moreover the BC to the south presents two maxima in the\n\n32\n\n\n\nmesoscale period range, 68 and 148 days (red dots). The semiannual variability in this case is\n\nnot clearly present, as in the spectrum for the northern part. The spectrum has a third maximum\n\naround 92 days. Therefore as observed in Figure 2.11A there is variability to the south of the\n\nSBi in 92 days period band. Since this third variability maximum is linked to the phenomena\n\nalready studied in the subsection 2.3.1 we will focus the study of the southern part to periods of\n\n68 days and 148 days, hereafter 68-D and 148-D.\n\nFigure 2.14: Same as the Figure 2.9 but to the south of the bifurcation. Two red dots represent\nthe periods of 68 and 148 days.\n\nWe applied the methodology described in section 2.2.2 to determine the wavenumber of both\n\n68-D and 148-D signals (Figure 2.15).\n\nThe 68-D signal has a maximum in the wavenumber spectrum of -0.01630 km?1 - 385 km\n\nwavelength. However because of the data sampling resolution this wavenumber actually rep-\n\nresents a probable range of ?0.01770 k m?1 ? k ? ?0.01400 k m?1. Nevertheless this range is\nsmaller (94 km) than the one of the 92-D signal, since the wavenumber of 68-D signal is not as\n\nclose to the limit of wavenumber resolution.\n\nThe 148-D presents a wavenumber spectrum increasing towards a maximum of -0.00815 km?1.\n\nThe spectral resolution limitation is more problematic in this case since the wavenumber of\n\nmaximum energy is in the limit of wavenumber resolution, being the closest to zero, not con-\n\nsidering non-propagating features. Therefore the wavenumber of 148-D is in a range between\n\n?0.00612 km?1 and ?0.00978 km?1. This wavenumber range represents a wavelength range of\n400 km.\n\n33\n\n\n\nFigure 2.15: Spectral determination of most important wavenumber for each maximum in Fig-\nure 2.14.

(B): spectral mean power [m2 km?1], black dots represent\nspectral resolution and red dot dominant wavenumber, solid line for 68 day and dashed for 148.\n\nThe region to the south of the SBi has two dominant mesoscale variability periods and for\n\npractical matters, they were analyzed separately.\n\n68 days signal\n\nThe main pathway of the 68-D signal is obtained by the same methods described in subsec-\n\ntion 2.2.3. Figure 2.16A shows the correlation field obtained by comparing the time series of\n\naltimetry with one in 46.125?W and 28.875?S (green point), the BC path is also showed.\n\nThe main pattern of the 68-D signal is two troughs of correlation, one to the north and one\n\nto the south of the chosen point. It is observable in the correlation field that the values after this\n\ntwo minima decrease rapidly, so only one and a half wavelength is clear as a pathway. Therefore\n\nhalf a wavelength from the point of control there is not an obvious pattern of propagation. The\n\n68-D correlation field appears as a wave propagating southwestward not purely parallel to the\n\nBC axis, which makes this signal likely to be linked to the current meandering, or at least the BC\n\ndynamics.\n\nBy measuring the distance between the troughs and crests of correlation, we estimated the\n\nwavelength of 68-D to be 398 km. This wavelength is 13 km bigger than the estimated from\n\nthe spectrum of the BC Hovm\u00f6ller diagram (Figure 2.15). From this correlation field, we can\n\n34\n\n\n\nestimate a better axis of propagation of the wave, which we used to make a new Hovm\u00f6ller\n\ndiagram specific to the wave path (Figure 2.16B).\n\nFigure 2.16: Same as Figure 2.11 but with data filtered in 68 day period.\n\nWith the new Hovm\u00f6ller diagram we calculated a maximum wavenumber of -0.0169 km?1,\n\n371 km wavelength, by using the method in section 2.2.2(Figure 2.17). Since the new Hov-\n\nm\u00f6ller diagram presents only one and a half wavelength, the 68-D wavenumber is closer to\n\nthe spectral resolution limit than was the case when it was determined for the BC axis pathway\n\n(Figure 2.15).\n\nThe result of the Hovm\u00f6ller diagram along the 68-D signal pathway presents southwestward\n\npropagation signal (Figure 2.18A). It can be noted that there are signals in other frequency bands\n\nbesides the 68-D. In order to isolate the 68-D signal, we applied the FIR2D filter, configured with\n\nthe estimated wavenumber, frequency and direction of propagation (Figure 2.18B).\n\nThe pathway of the wave according to Figure 2.16B has its northern point at 27?S. Therefore\n\nwe do not identify in Figure 2.18A the presence of the SLA discontinuity related to the SBi.\n\nThe filtered Hovm\u00f6ller diagram shows the 68-D wave as a not intermittent phenomena like the\n\n92-D. This signal exists in the entire time series. However in some periods (i.e. day 1400) the\n\n68-D signal is not present in all the pathway. So there are time periods that the wave does not\n\nreach the southern point of the estimated pathway (i.e, day 400 and day 1400 in Figure 2.17B).\n\n35\n\n\n\nFigure 2.17: Same as Figure 2.15 but for 68 day signal in the new Hovm\u00f6ller diagram path\ndefined in Figure 2.16B.\n\nFigure 2.18: Same as Figure 2.13 but for 68-D signal in the new Hovm\u00f6ller diagram path\ndefined in Figure 2.16B.\n\n36\n\n\n\nThe phase speed was estimated from the filtered Hovm\u00f6ller diagram by using the Radon\n\ntransform, and then was obtained an improved estimative of the wavelength. The accurate wave-\n\nlength for the 68-D signal is 397 km. This wave explains 21% of the variance of the SLA along\n\nthe BC axis pathway, and it explains 27% along its propagation pathway from Figure 2.16B.\n\nNonetheless the 62-D wave accounts for at least one fifth of the variance of the BC within the\n\nSB. The increase in explained variance shows the better sampling of the signal with the new\n\npathway.\n\n148 days signal\n\nBy employing the same methodology used to analyze the 92-D and 68-D signals, we cal-\n\nculated the correlation field compared to the time series of the point located at 46.125?W and\n\n28.875?S, which is in the BC axis and south of the SBi, as was the case in the analysis of the\n\n68-D signal.\n\nThe 148-D correlation field presents a preferential pathway through which the wave reaches\n\nthe BC in an almost zonal line centered in 28?S (Figure 2.19). Moreover there are elongated\n\nbands of correlation for the 148-D signal suggesting a wave front propagating westward, simi-\n\nlar to the one in 92-D. The wave fronts seem to be meridionaly restricted in the north to 23?S.\n\nHowever within the SB the only clear wave reaching the BC is the one with a propagation path-\n\nway centered in 28?S. Using this pathway we estimated a wavelength of 739 km for 148-D\n\nwave, considering crests and troughs of correlation.\n\nThe 148-D wave does not present a propagation of troughs and crests along the BC axis within\n\nthe SB. This is due to the fact that the wave phase is not propagated along the current. Moreover\n\nthe correlation along the current axis is an elongated maximum which is possibly because the\n\n148-D does not induces meandering of the BC. Instead the wave probably inserts(removes)\n\nenergy from the current causing an increase(decrease) of its signal as a whole within the SB.\n\nTherefore, although the 148-D wave does not induces meandering of the BC, it modulates its\n\ntransport by changing its velocity.\n\n37\n\n\n\nFigure 2.19: Same as Figure 2.11 but with data filtered in 148 day period.\n\nThe improved pathway to make the Hovm\u00f6ller diagram for the 148-D signal can be observed\n\nin the Figure 2.19B. Along this pathway, even though there is a decrease in the correlation\n\nfronts at ? 17?W, one can observe the alternating correlation pattern associated with a wave\nin full longitudinal range. Although it may seem from this result that the 148-D propagates\n\ntowards the BC from at least ? 0?E, this methodology is not adequate to provide certainty to this\nconclusion. Further studies are necessary to address this question.\n\nBy using the method described in section 2.2.2 for the Hovm\u00f6ller diagram along the path of\n\nthe wave (almost zonal at 28?S), we obtained a spectral energy maximum in the wavenumber\n\nof 0.00873 km?1 - 719 km wavelength (Figure 2.20). Wavelengths lower than ?400 km have\nalmost zero energy and the spectrum increases towards a maximum. Due to the length of the\n\npath to the 148-D Hovm\u00f6ller diagram (4300 km), this maximum of energy is not as in the\n\nspectral limit as was the case when it was estimated from the Hovm\u00f6ller diagram of the BC\n\n(Figure 2.15).\n\nAnother difference is that the 148-D wavenumber spectrum does not present a single maxi-\n\nmum and decreases rapidly towards wavenumbers near zero, like 68-D and 92-D (Figure 2.17\n\nand Figure 2.12). Instead the spectrum presents a second maximum with a spectral energy close\n\nthe first. The second maximum have 99.4 % of the total spectral energy of the first. This sec-\n\n38\n\n\n\nFigure 2.20: Same as Figure 2.15 but for 148 day signal in the new Hovm\u00f6ller diagram path\ndefined in ??.\n\nond maximum wavenumber is -0.00727 km?1 - 864 km. Since the FFT spreads the energy of\n\nwavenumbers to a discrete spectrum, the presence of two close maximum is mostly due to the\n\nwavelength of 148-D signal being between 719-864 km range.\n\nThe Hovm\u00f6ller diagram of the 148-D pathway presents crests and troughs and a dominance\n\nof a westward propagating features with a well defined phase speed (Figure 2.21A). We used the\n\nFIR2D filter with a 148 day period and 719 km wavelength to isolate this dominant signal. The\n\nfiltered H\u00f6vmoller diagram presents a well defined propagating feature along all the pathway\n\ndefined for the 148-D signal (?4000 km). The propagation along the entire x-axis indicates a\nphenomena that propagates from 5?W to 45?W. Moreover the 148-D is present in the filtered\n\ndiagram during all the time series. Although its values decrease sometimes (i.e., day 200 in\n\nFigure 2.21) indicating this to be a permanent feature at this latitude.\n\nA more accurate value of wavelength of the 148-D wave is 790 km, as estimated with Radon\n\ntransform using the filtered Hovm\u00f6ller diagram. This wavelength explains the unique wavenum-\n\nber spectrum with two maxima (Figure 2.20B). Since we are observing a phenomena with a\n\nwavenumber exactly between the two discrete maxima.\n\nThe 148-D wave has a maximum amplitude of 0.075 m and accounts for an explained vari-\n\nance of 25.7 % of the SLA in its propagation pathway. However, this explained variance de-\n\ncreases when the wave reaches the BC domain. The BC variance in its axis explained by the\n\n148-D signal is 9%. This low variance of the SLA along the current axis is probably due to the\n\n39\n\n\n\nFigure 2.21: Same as Figure 2.13 but for 148 day signal in the new Hovm\u00f6ller diagram path\ndefined in Figure 2.19B.\n\nway how the wave transfers energy to the current. Although there is a transfer of high values\n\nof energy to the current as the 148-D reaches the BC, this is done increasing and decreasing\n\nthe BC velocity and therefore its transport. Andres et al. (2008) using satellite altimetry and in\n\nsitu composit of data obtained an empirical function to estimate the transport of the KC. The\n\nauthors identified the main variability of the KC transport near the South China Sea in a range\n\nof 100-170 days with the maximum of 150 days. Moreover the main variability of both KC and\n\nBC are related to its transport modulation (Zhang et al., 2001).\n\nMata et al. (2006) used 6 moorings of current meter data to study the mesoscale variability\n\n40\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: Main spectral characteristics of each dominant signal to south and north of SBi.\n\nPeriod [days] Wavelength [km] cp [ms?1]\n\nNorth 92 491 0.06\n\nSouth\n68 397 0.07\n\n148 790 0.06\n\nof the EAC. The authors identified the mesoscale band to vary from the three moorings near the\n\nslope (to the coastal part of the current) to the three in the outter part of the current (one in the\n\ncurrent\u2019s core and the other two in the interior ocean). The variability of the EAC is dominated\n\nby a period around 60 days near its core and coastal half. The moorings in the core of the\n\nEAC have a maximum mesoscale variability in periods near 100 days. No spectral information\n\nis available for the two moorings in the interior, however the variability period linked to the\n\ncurrent meandering (60 days) is similar to the one observed in this study for the BC at south of\n\nthe SBi.\n\nWe identified the spectral characteristics of the most important variability signals. Its fre-\n\nquencies were obtained with the method in section 2.2.2 and the wavenumbers were estimated\n\nwith Radon transform. The spectral information of the signals to the north and south of the SBi,\n\nas well as the phase speed of the phenomena, are listed in Table 2.1.\n\nTaking in account the presented results so far about the 92-D, 68-D and 148-D signals, we\n\nwill try to elucidate what are the dynamics driving each one of them. The three waves differ,\n\nbesides its location to the north or south of the SBi, in the orientation of its propagation axis.\n\nTherefore the dynamics of 68-D will be addressed separately from the 92-D and 148-D.\n\nThe 68-D wave propagates southwestward near the BC-axis. Therefore the signal of 68-D\n\nis probably a variability linked to current meandering. Most of the recent studies of the BC\n\ndynamics use a linear approach (Silveira et al., 2008; Rocha et al., 2014). Consequently the\n\nimportance of nonlinearity in the meandering of the BC have been neglected.\n\nTo access the importance of nonlinearity is to analyze the importance of advective terms. To\n\nestimate the importance of advection of velocity compared with its local term, we will use the\n\nratio between both. Considering the total acceleration d ud t from the equation of motion as\n\n?~u\n\n?t\n+~u \u00b7?~u, (2.9a)\n\n~u = ui? + v j? + w k? , (2.9b)\n\n41\n\n\n\nthe dimension of each velocity term becomes\n\nU\n\nT\n+U U\n\nL\n. (2.10)\n\nThe ratio between those two terms is\n\nU 2L?1\n\nU T ?1\n= U 2T L?1U ?1 = U T L?1. (2.11)\n\nThe phase speed of a wave (C p ) have a dimension of\n\nLT ?1. (2.12)\n\nThen the ratio between the local and advective terms of the velocity, hereafter call as Li is given\n\nby\n\nLi = U T L?1 = U C ?1p , (2.13)\n\nbeing U the tangential velocity. Given the phase speed of the 68-D wave in Table 2.1, to estimate\n\nits linearity we need to determine U .\n\nConsidering a QG framework, ~ug is\n\nug = ?\n??\n\n?y\n, (2.14a)\n\nv g =\n??\n\n?x\n, (2.14b)\n\ntaking the tangential velocity in meridional direction and the Equation 2.8,\n\nv g =\ng\n\nf0\n\n??\n\n?x\n. (2.15)\n\nWe calculate v g by discretizing Equation 2.15 so that\n??\n?x becomes\n\n??\n?x . Then we consider ??\n\nthe difference in SLA between a consecutive crest and a trough and ?x is the distance between\n\nthe same interval, which corresponds to half wavelength. The Li parameter of the 68-D wave is\n\n2.25.\n\nThe meandering of the BC has recently been study within the SB as a result of baroclinic in-\n\nstability (Rocha et al., 2014). The authors identified unstable waves with the same wavelength\n\nat 25?S, however with twice the phase speed, i.e. half the period. At 28?S the authors did not\n\n42\n\n\n\nobserved waves of 400 km to be unstable. Nonetheless the authors used an unidimensional in-\n\nstability linear model and the results obtained might be due to the limitations of their method,\n\nspecially the disregard of nonlinearity. Moreover the authors used mooring current meters and\n\nanalyzed the BC meandering at 25?S and 28?S in the BC-axis. The 68-D as identified in the Fig-\n\nure 2.16 does not propagate along the exact current axis, instead a little offshore of it. Therefore\n\nthis can account for the difference in the waves found by the authors and ours.\n\nAt ? 23?S Silveira et al. (2008) studied the quasi-stationary meanders of the BC with a linear\nbaroclinic instability model and observed a similar wave in frequency and wavelength, but with\n\npositive phase speed - i.e. northward propagation. These authors studied this as the formation of\n\nthe Cape Frio Eddy (CFE). The formation of this quasi-stationary eddies could be one possible\n\nmechanism to generate the 68-D wave found in our study. The instability wave initially causes\n\nthe current to meander. After the meander is fully develop and the eddy is shed the current is\n\nperturbed. This shedding of the CFE can generate perturbations to the south of CF and be the\n\nresponsible for the 68-D wave generation.\n\nBy utilizing SST data Bil\u00f3 (2015) identified a recurrent formation of cyclonic eddies, associ-\n\nated with a wave-like perturbation, between 27?S and 31?S. The author studied the recurrence\n\nof the phenomena, observing an occurence of 5 to 6 events per year. This implies a period of\n\nformation of cyclones between 73 and 60 days. The period of this cyclonic features resembles\n\na lot with the 68-D signal. The author identified this structures to be an important mechanism\n\nof shelf-slope mass exchanges in this region. However, he obtained a wavelength of almost half\n\nof that identified in this study, 219 km compared to 397 km. Moreover the cyclones occured\n\nin the onshore side of the BC, near the shelf break. Taking in consideration the wavelength an\n\nlocalization of the phenomena, we cannot state with certainty that we are looking at the same\n\nphenomena described by Bil\u00f3 (2015), even though the period of occurrence is the same.\n\nNonetheless the 68-D wave can play an important role in shelf-slope water exchanges with\n\ncyclones generating at every 68 days, and this can be of great importance to the local natural\n\nsystem, i.e. primary productivity induced by cyclonic meander Campos et al. (2000).\n\nThe 92-D and 148-D signals propagate to west, also they propagate as a wave front. There-\n\nfore based on this propagation direction we addressed first how these signals are related to first\n\nmode RW. The linear dispersion relation is given by\n\n? = ??k\nk 2 + l 2 + R?2\n\nd\n\n, (2.16)\n\n43\n\n\n\nwhere ? is the frequency, k is the wavenumber, Rd is the deformation radius and ? is the\n\nadvection of planetary vorticity Gill (2016). To estimate this dispersion relation in the waves\n\npropagating axis we calculated deformation radii using the methodology of Flierl (1978) and\n\nthe climatological Brunt-V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency profile (Figure 2.2). The first baroclinic deformation\n\nradius to the latitude of propagation is 51 km. Using the deformation radius and considering an\n\nalmost zonal propagation, k 2 \u00c0 l 2, the dispersion relation becomes\n\n? = ??k\nk 2 + 51000?2 . (2.17)\n\nBoth the 148-D and 92-D signals do not match the Rossby waves (RW) dispersion relation\n\ncurve (Figure 2.22). However both dispersion relation of the signals are close to the line tangent\n\nto the non-dispersive part of the RW, refered as the nondispersive line nondispersive line (NDL).\n\nAccording to Early et al. (2011) the presence of features along this region of the spectrum is an\n\nindicative of nonlinear processes. Using a shallow-water model with both linear and nonlinear\n\nQG setup, he identified that when the nonlinear terms are negligible and they have only linear\n\nwaves, there is not the presence of energy along the NDL in the spectrum.\n\nMorten (2017) used a single-layer, shallow-water, beta-plane, quasi-geostrophic, turbulence\n\nmodel to study frequency-wavenumber spectrum, and identified the presence of energy along\n\nthe NDL in the case characterized by westward propagating coherent eddies.\n\nThe fact that these two signal are close to the NDL is probably due to the its nonlinearity\n\nand the importance of advective terms. Using the Equation 2.13 the linearity parameter is 1.11\n\nand 1.13 to 92-D and 148-D respectively. However both signals are along the NDL, the 148-\n\nD signal is closer to the dispersion relation curve of RW than the 92-D. Therefore the 148-D\n\nalthough seemingly a nonlinear phenomena could be a RW not along the dispersion relation\n\ncurve because of the over simplification of the linear theory used to estimate the dispersion\n\nrelation of the planetary waves.\n\nConsidering the linear theory, the 148-D frequency, wavenumber and the deformation radius,\n\n? would have to be 2.7657 \u00d7 10?11m?1s?1. The local value of ? at ? 28?, axis of 148-D phe-\nnomena, is 2.0157 \u00d7 10?11. The ? parameter can be better estimated considering in the linear\ntheory an effective ? term to get a more accurate linear dispersion relation of RW (e.g. Samelson,\n\n2010). This effective ? term considers not only the advection of planetary vorticity, but also the\n\nbackground velocity field and the effect of bottom slope.\n\n44\n\n\n\nFigure 2.22: Dispersion relation of known phenomena, green line dispersion relation of\nbarotropic and red line first baroclinic mode linear Rossby waves, black dashed line the NDL f,\nblue dot the 148 day signal and blue star the 92 day signal.\n\nStill according to the linear theory of RW\n\n?\n\n?Rd\n? 0.5, (2.18)\n\nwhich means that for each deformation radius there is a minimum(maximum) period(frequency).\n\nTherefore, considering a fixed period, this means that for each period there is a minimum pos-\n\nsible deformation radius and therefore a maximum latitude value, since in the linear theory Rd\n\nis\n\nRd =\n?\n\ng ?H\n| f0 |\n\n, (2.19)\n\nwith H the local depth, g ? the reduced gravity and | f0 | the planetary vorticity. This restriction\nin latitude is called the critical latitude of RW.\n\nTherefore, for the local Rd of 51 km, the critical latitude is 29?S(17?S) for the 148-D(92-\n\nD) phenomena. So, considering a linear theory approach the 92-D wave is 8? past its critical\n\nlatitude. Taking in account its critical latitude, linear parameter and dispersion relation, it is\n\nstrongly suggested that the 92-D is not a linear RW.\n\nTo further investigate the nonlinearity of this waves, we analyze the spectrum of both waves\n\nto access if there are high values of energy along the NDL, in the site of the waves.\n\nSpectrum at 25?\n\nThe 92-D wave has a zonal propagation pathway along the 25?S parallel. (Wortham and\n\nWunsch, 2014) using a spectral model identified the world oceans characteristic local zonal and\n\n45\n\n\n\nmeridional wave number, period and phase speed. To the SB at this latitude their results are\n\napproximately the same phase speed but a zonal wavelength two times bigger than found in this\n\nstudy, therefore a period two times higher.\n\nThe spectrum of the Hovm\u00f6ller diagram made for the propagation pathway of the 92-D\n\nsignal has great part of its energy along the NDL but scattered around it. The first maximum of\n\nenergy is related to non-propagating low-frequency phenomena. However the second maximum\n\nis at 100 days and in the same wavelength of the 92-D wave. This second maximum of energy\n\nis mostly due to the 92-D signal in this latitude (Figure 2.23).\n\nThe spectrum shows a trend to follow the NDL which indicates that the local phenomena are\n\nlinked to nonlinear terms. Energy in the NDL region is present in the k ?? spectrum when the\nvariability is dominated by the presence of coherent eddies. Therefore, and also considering the\n\nwave-like propagation of fronts, the 92-D signal is most likely to be nonlinear wave instead of\n\na pathway of propagating nonlinear eddies (Wortham and Wunsch, 2014; Morten, 2017).\n\nFigure 2.23: Wavenumber frequency spectrum for the 92-D wave pathway. Spectral energy\n[Lo g 10m2d a y ?1k m?1], black solid line the dispersion relation of first mode linear RW, white\ndashed line the NDL for this waves and blue start the 92-D wave.\n\nSpectrum at 28?\n\nThe 148-D signal propagates along the 28?S parallel with a wavelength of 790 km. Wortham\n\nand Wunsch (2014) identified in a spectral model a signal with similar wavelength, but a higher\n\nperiod in this latitude, as in the 92-D signal.\n\n46\n\n\n\nThe spectrum for this wave presents a narrower region of high energy, which is mostly re-\n\nstricted to the NDL (Figure 2.24). Moreover it does not present a substantial spectral energy\n\nalong the RW linear dispersion relation curve. Therefore, there a high activity of nonlinear\n\nprocessesis in this latitude.\n\nFigure 2.24: Same as Figure 2.23 but for the 148-D wave pathway.\n\nHowever, considering only the critical latitude of the 148-D signal as a linear wave, there is\n\na possibility that this signal is a RW. Further studies are needed in order to access the possibility\n\nthat this phenomena is a result of the interaction of propagating linear waves and nonlinear\n\neddies (Polito and Sato, 2015).\n\n47\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nQuasi-Synoptic Observations\n\nIn this chapter, we will use in situ observations to provide a three-dimensional view of me-\n\nanders identified as the main sources of variability of the BC within SB. In particular, we focus\n\non showing evidence of the 68-D vorticity wave, its surface signature and vertical structure.\n\nThe longer waves associated with westward propagating signals from the interior of the South\n\nAtlantic basin were not captured due to the synoptic cruise sampling strategy.\n\n3.1 Dataset\n\n3.1.1 In situ Quasi-Synoptic Velocity Measurements\n\nThe in situ velocity data set used in this work was obtained during the IOUSP-PETROBRAS\n\nOceanographic Expedition \"CERES V\", conducted by the R/V Alpha Crucis between Novem-\n\nber 1st and 23rd, 2013. The velocity data was acquired using a 75-kHz broadband VMADCP\n\nwith maximum profiling extent of about 500 m (which is dependent on sea conditions). The\n\ndata acquisition transects are presented in Figure 3.1. The data was processed with the standard\n\nCommon Ocean Data Access System (CODAS), following the procedures described in Firing\n\net al. (1995).\n\n48\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: The CERES V cruise VMADCP sampling tracks (thick solid black lines). Solid red\nlines correspond to the transects used in this work to build the velocity sections. The color\ngrading underneath the tracks denotes the bathymetry of the study area. The black dashed line\nmarks the position of the 200m isobath, which is the most accepted depth to represent the shelf\nbreak in SB.\n\n3.2 Methods: Objective Mapping\n\nObjective Analysis (OA) is an optimal interpolation scheme traditionally used in mapping\n\noceanographic data (Bretherton et al., 1976; Carter and Robinson, 1987). The OA is least\n\nsquares scheme, based on the Gauss-Markov theorem. In this work, we use both scalar and\n\nvector versions of OA to build velocity vertical sections and the horizontal velocity vector and\n\nstreamfunction maps.\n\nThis OA scheme first step consists of approximating (or fitting) the data (or sample) correla-\n\ntion function to a horizontally isotropic Gaussian function given by\n\nC (r ) = (1 ??2)e?r 2 /l 2c , (3.1)\n\nbeing r the Euclidian distance between two data points, ? the uncorrelated error variance, l\n\n49\n\n\n\nis the correlation length. The fit nonlinearly provides the correlation length and linearly, the\n\nsample error variance. The second step consists of applying the Gauss-Markov theorem in the\n\nform of:\n\n??j = C j i Ci i ?1?i , (3.2)\n\nwhere ??j (?i) represents the j th grid point (the i th observation location) at which the quan-\n\ntity ? is interpolated (was measured). Ci i is the data autocorrelation function and C j i is the\n\ncross-correlation between data and gridded fields. We encourage the reader to seek Carter and\n\nRobinson (1987) for more details. We should also mention the technique developed by Brether-\n\nton et al. (1976) used to map the streamfuction field from scattered velocity measurements is\n\napplied to the CERES V VMADCP velocity vector measurements.\n\nOA schemes considering either Equation 3.1 or its anisotropic version have been successfully\n\nused to map scalar and vector fields related to the southwestern boundary currents (da Silveira\n\net al., 1994; Silveira et al., 2000, 2004; Goes et al., 2005; Silveira et al., 2008; Soutelino et al.,\n\n2011). In particular, Silveira et al. (2000) (Goes et al. (2005)) introduced free-slip (no-slip)\n\nboundary conditions within the OA scheme to constrain the mapped flow in the presence of\n\nsolid boundary in the area of interest. We opt here to apply no-slip boundary conditions by\n\nintroducing v = u = 0 input vector along an isobath, which is taken to be the limit between\nseawater and land.\n\n3.3 Results and Discussion\n\n3.3.1 Near-Surface Streamfunction Fields\n\nIn order to identify the signature of the 68-D wave in the VMADCP data, we used the vector OA\n\nto map the streamfunction ? directly from the observed u(x , y ) (v (x , y )), the zonal (meridional)\n\nvelocity component at a chosen depth. The correlation length and sample error variance used\n\nin an a priori correlation function (Equation 3.1) were 1.2? and 0.1, respectively. The so-\n\ncalled \"observed streamfunction\" virtually represents the geostrophic ? and, therefore the ?\n\ndistribution at near-surface can directly compared with the AVISO ?.\n\nThe shallowest VMADCP data bin is 30 m. This depth is embedded within the mixed layer\n\nand take it as close enough to the surface to be compared with the AVISO ADT field. We also\n\nimposed the no-slip boundary condition at the 30m isobath, which is found at the inner shelf\n\n50\n\n\n\nwhere neither the geostrophic balance is valid nor the BC is in this region. The ? map at 30 m\n\nand its accompanying interpolation normalized error are presented in Figure 3.2.\n\nFigure 3.2: Maps of the CERES V. (A): observational streamfunction ?. (B): the associated\ninterpolation error at 30m. The gray area represents depths shallower than 100 m; the mangenta\ndashed curve denotes the shelf break position.\n\nThe ? distribution depicted in Figure 3.2 presents a highly meandering BC with incursions\n\n(anticyclonic meanders) onto the shelf at 24.5?S and 28?S. Excursions (cyclonic meanders) can\n\nbe seen at 23?S, 26?S, 28?S and 30.5?S. Oceanward of the BC axis, an anticyclone-cyclone pair\n\n51\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Comparison between the (A) CERES V ?o and (B) AVISO streamfunction ?a fields\nduring the cruise period. The black solid line delimits the CERES V sampling area. The gray\narea represents depths shallower than 100 m; the magenta dashed curve denotes the shelf break\nposition.\n\nis clearly identified between 42?W and 46?W.\n\nThe investigation of the 68D wave signal was conducted using altimetry data in chapter 2. We\n\nhere seek to identify if any of the vorticity structures observed during the CERES V cruise are\n\nrelated to those waves, which propagate southwestward parallel to the current axis. Figure 3.3\n\ncompares the near-surface ? (streamfuction from CERES V) with the ?a (streamfuction for the\n\naveraged AVISO data during cruise) distribution. As expected due to averaging, interpolation\n\nand synopticity issues, the BC meander amplitudes are smaller in the AVISO field than that\n\nof the CERES V ? field. It is probably a precision issue associated with resolving the tides\n\nand the geoid at shallower depths. Thus the ?a field is smoother. Nonetheless, the vortical\n\npair described in the last paragraph is identifiable in the AVISO map as well. In both maps,\n\nthe cyclone-anticyclone pair exhibits an approximately 400-km extension, which matches the\n\ncalculated 68-D wavelength.\n\nIn order to further pursue whether the vortical pair present in the \"raw\" AVISO map is related\n\n52\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Comparison between (A) the AVISO streamfunction field (?a ) during the CERES\nV cruise and (B) its FFT-filtered version for a band centered in 68 days (?68). The gray area\nrepresents depths shallower than 100 m; the mangenta dashed curve denotes the shelf break\nposition.\n\nindeed to the 68-D wave, we apply the same filtering process employed in the analysis described\n\nin chapter 2. We thus again use a band-pass FFT filter centered in period of 68-Ds and with a\n\nrange of 10%. The filtered ?68 field Figure 3.4 preserves the presence of both the cyclone and\n\nanticyclone bordering the current. The basin interior is characterized by nearly zero velocities\n\nand reassures in the spatial domain the findings of chapter 2: the 68-D vorticity waves are\n\nintrinsically associated with the BC axis and motion.\n\nThe ?68 map reproduces the same two vortical features within the SB along the BC but the\n\nanticyclone-cyclone extent is overestimated in about ?50 km if compared to both the non-\nfiltered ?a and the CERES V ?o . This difference could have occured because the ?a may\n\nhave merged the two adjacent anticyclones centered at (24?S, 44?W) and (26.5?S, 44?W) as a\n\nsingle one. Aiming to unravel the reason, we rewrite Equation 2.2 in terms of the geostrophic\n\nstreamfunction using Equation 2.6 to obtain\n\n53\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: The 68-D filtered total and anomaly AVISO streamfunction fields (?68 and ??68)for\nthe CERES V cruise period. The gray area represents depths shallower than 100 m; the man-\ngenta dashed curve denotes the shelf break position.\n\n??(x , y, t ) = ?a (x , y, t ) ???(x , y ) ; (3.3)\n\nwhere the ?a (x , y, t ),??(x , y ),??(x , y, t ) definitions are analogous to those of ?a (x , y, t ), \u00af?(x , y ),\n\n??(x , y, t ). We opt to present the ??68 field and compare it with the total ?68 (Figure 3.5). It is\n\nclearly seen in the anomaly streamfunction field that both anticyclones at 44?W are identifiable.\n\nThe crest and trough of the 68-D vorticity wave pattern is shapely displayed. The masking\n\neffect of such feature is due to the ??(x , y ) computed from the MDT.\n\nThe 68-D wave propagation axis is not fully aligned with the mean BC as well as totally\n\nparallel to the shelf break either (Figure 3.6). But it is clear that vortical pair propagates south\n\nat the phase speed of 0.07 m s?1 estimated in chapter 2. As it continues to propagate south-\n\nwestward, the wave train gets nearer the shelf break. Hence, it is likely that it can promote\n\nshelf-slope exchange as predicted by Bil\u00f3 (2015). Moreover, the more oblique propagation the\n\nwave exhibits relative to the BC axis, the weaker its signal is (Figure 2.18). One possibility is\n\n54\n\n\n\nthat interaction with topography discontinues the wave pattern; another is the limitation of the\n\nAVISO data in mapping accurately features at shallow depths. On the other hand, in the cases\n\nthe wave propagates exactly parallel to the current axis, its signal is not seen as attenuated in\n\nthe Hovm\u00f6ller diagram.\n\nFigure 3.6: The 68-D wave propagation: (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) and (F). The gray area represents\ndepths shallower than 100 m; the magenta dashed curve denotes the shelf break position.\n\nWe present in Figure 3.7 a Hovm\u00f6ller diagram with a 6-year time series span centered in\n\n55\n\n\n\ntime on the CERES IV cruise period. The intent is to produce here an analogous diagram to\n\nthat shown in Figure 2.18. We repeated the length time to allow the reader a comparison with\n\nthe figure from chapter 2 in terms of phase speeds (i.e., the troughs or crests distance-time\n\ninclination). The anticyclone (to the north) and the cyclone (to the south) of the 68-D wave\n\ndisplayed at Figure 3.3, Figure 3.4, Figure 3.5 and temporally followed through the six panels\n\nof Figure 3.6 are marked by black arrows at its most upstream position. We do see a clear\n\nsouthward propagation and a discontinuation at ?400 km in the distance axis, which coincides\nwith the CSM location (which is marked by a magenta dashed line). The wave structure to the\n\nsouthwest of 400 km line displays bifurcations and much lower amplitude values of the features.\n\nThis probably indicate that either the wave ceased to exist somehow or it was reflected since its\n\ntrajectory may be oblique relative to the mean current path and hit the western boundary.\n\nFigure 3.7: Hovm\u00f6ller diagram of the streamfuction anomaly of the AVISO series centered at\nthe CERES V period. The black arrows mark the anticyclone (crest) and the cyclone (trough)\nof the 68-D wave captured by the cruise sampling. The magenta dashed line denotes the CSM\nlocation.\n\n56\n\n\n\nWe now return to CERES V data aiming a more quantitative comparison between the ? and\n\n? fields, rather the more qualitative one depicted in Figure 3.4. This time, however, we compare\n\nthe observational ? with the 68-D filtered version. We want prove that the vortical pair detected\n\nin both maps is indeed the same feature depicted simultaneously by in situ measurements and\n\nremote sensing. Therefore, the features should be located approximately in the same geograph-\n\nical location in both maps, despite the differences of original data coverage and interpolation\n\ntechniques. In order to do so, let us consider two scalar fields A(x , y ) and B (x , y ). A simple way\n\nto evaluate whether they are parallel to each other is to calculate the Jacobian matrix of their\n\ngradients. If they are parallel, then ?A \u00d7?B = 0, i.e.,\n\nJ ( A, B ) = d e t\n?\n??A?x ?A?y\n?B\n?x\n\n?B\n?y\n\n?\n? = ?A\n\n?x\n\n?B\n\n?y\n? ?A\n?y\n\n?B\n\n?x\n, (3.4)\n\nTherefore, if J ( A, B ) = 0, so is ?A \u00d7 ?B = 0 and A and B are parallel. We then calculate the\nJacobian field of the filtered data with the cruise data (Figure 3.8). We should note that the\n\nJacobian field is higher where the ? fields differ more. As expected, the higher values are found\n\nnear shelf break. Nonetheless the Jacobian values within the two main vorticity structures\n\npresent in the filtered data are very low, which demonstrates that this cyclone and anticyclone\n\nare positioned at similar location in both data sets. The features in the CERES V map are\n\nsmaller, which explains the increasing of the Jacobian values towards their edge. These size\n\ndifferences can be due to distinct original data resolution, mapping procedures and filtering.\n\n57\n\n\n\nFigure 3.8: The Jacobian between the CERES V ? field and the filtered AVISO ? field.\n\n3.3.2 Velocity Vertical Sections\n\nIn the previous subsection, we identified a 68-D crest-trough vortical pair in the CERES V\n\nnear-surface streamfunction maps and examined its correspondence on the AVISO streamfunc-\n\ntion maps. In the present subsection, we describe two vertical sections of the same situ data\n\nset that captured the anticyclone and the cyclone which form the pair. Figure 3.9 displays the\n\nVMADCP tracks with the two transects that sampled the eddies in red.\n\nNeither of the red-marked transects crossed the eddy but center. As a matter of fact, both\n\nsampled their northeastern borders. Therefore, we do not expect to see velocities comparable\n\nto those of the BC as seen in the ?,?a ,?68 and ??68 horizontal distributions. However, we do\n\nexpect to comment on their vertical structure.\n\n58\n\n\n\nFigure 3.9: The VMADCP tracks (black thick solid lines) overlaid on the CERES V 30m stream-\nfunction field. The red thick solid line highlights the two transects which vertical structure will\nbe shown and described in this subsection. The gray area represents depths shallower than 100\nm; the mangenta dashed curve denotes the shelf break position.\n\nAnticyclonic Eddy transect\n\nFigure 3.10: Vertical section of the VMADCP profiled velocity of transect #3 (the northern red\ntransect in Figure 3.9). The black area represents the topography, and the magenta dashed line\nthe position of outermost station of LADCP top-bottom profile carried out during the cruise and\ndescribed by Bil\u00f3 (2015).\n\n59\n\n\n\nIn this transect (Figure 3.10), we note a BC well attached to the shelf break with a maximum\n\nvelocity of ? -0.75 m s?1. Although the VMADCP profiling extent did not capture the IWBC\ndomain, the velocities at 450 m depth are at ? -0.05 m s?1 and the BC velocities appear to be\ndecreasing with increasing depth. This shallow BC is due to the fact that this transect is to the\n\nnorth of the SBi near the slope, and so the BC had not thicken yet. Bil\u00f3 (2015) analyzed the\n\ntop-bottom current pattern obtained by LADCP in the transect sampled during the CERES V\n\n(November 2013) at same position of the northern red one shown in Figure 3.9. The authors\n\ndescribed that the BC reacher 500 m and the virtually 1500m-thick IWBC underneath it. Despite\n\nour depth constraint the southwestern velocity decrease depicted with VMADCP data suggests a\n\nsimilar current configuration is present in the CERES V cruise.\n\nThe BC volume transport is -14 Sv in the upper 450 m; its width is 160 km at the surface,\n\nbut the cruise did not sampled the whole current structure. Moreover the BC in this transect\n\nis leaning towards the shelf, which is in accordance with the pattern of a frontal anticyclonic\n\nmeander, such as the depicted in the ?o map (Figure 3.9).\n\nOceanward of the inner two-lobe structure associated with BC frontal slope, a second eddy\n\nsectional distribution can be identified in (Figure 3.10). This is the counterclock rotating feature\n\nlinked to the 68-D wave and the one we are interested in. Considering its velocity inversion\n\npattern, the inshore (offshore) lobe of the eddy, which is marked by the negative (positive)\n\nvelocities is centered at ?275 km (?350 km) from the transect starting point.\nThe anticyclone offshore lobe has a maximum velocity of 0.29 ms?1 and a transport of 5.9\n\nSv. This lobe is 140 km wide and reaches more than 450 m. The coastal lobe presents minimum\n\nvelocities of -0.15 ms?1 and is 70 km wide. Deeper than 200 m, its signal merges with the one\n\nfrom the BC frontal meander, as seen by inspecting Figure 3.9. The difference in the velocities\n\nbetween the two lobes might be caused by the cruise sampling, i.e., there is a 30? angle be-\n\ntween the line joining the anticyclone centers and the transect orientation. For this reason, the\n\nwidth and velocity between lobes differ importantly. The vertical extent of the better sampled\n\n(offshore) lobe is comparable with that of the BC. The BC exhibits higher velocity values (in\n\nmagnitude) at surface, where its velocity shear is also stronger. Both features seem to be at least\n\n500 m thick.\n\n60\n\n\n\nCyclonic Eddy transect\n\nFigure 3.11: Southern red transect in Figure 3.9. Filed contour of cross-transect velocity, black\narea the shelf break and slope and magenta dashed line the limit of LADCP collected during the\ncruise and used by Bil\u00f3 (2015).\n\nThe transect #4 (the southern red transect) seems as a virtual mirror image of transect #3,\n\nboth displayed in Figure 3.9. We observe a cyclonically meandering BC, which is distant from\n\nthe shelf break. This frontal cyclonic meander resembles the characteristics of others reported\n\nby Campos et al. (1995) from geostrophic estimates. The inshore lobe presents a maximum of\n\n0.38 m s?1. The maximum BC velocity is ?-0.55 m s?1 at its surface core. The BC vertical shear\nseems to be weaker than that observed in the northern transect and presents a more vertically\n\nelongated structure appearing to reach higher depths. At the corresponding CERES IV transect,\n\nBil\u00f3 (2015), through LADCP profiles, identified a BC which extended from the surface to 750 m\n\ndepth with the IWBC beneath it and flowing to north. The inner portion of the transect seems\n\nstill to be to the north of the SBi. As described by Boebel et al. (1999) and Legeais et al. (2013),\n\nthe bifurcation structure veers to south and develops a cyclonic retroflection at the shallowest\n\ndepths of the S\u00e3o Paulo Plateau.\n\nAdjacent to the cyclonic frontal BC meander, transect #4 exhibits vortical lobes of opposite\n\nsigns associated with the trough of the 68-D wave. The coastal lobe of the 68-D cyclone has\n\na vertical structure similar to that of the current and reaching 0.17 m s?1 at 400 m depth. This\n\nlobe maximum velocities are 0.29 m s?1 and its horizontal extension is of 88 km, with core\n\ndepth of ?80 m.The oceanic lobe has a horizontal extension of ?140 km and a maximum\nvelocity of -0.31 m s?1 with the maximum velocity at ? 110 m depth. Additionally, the volume\n\n61\n\n\n\ntransport of the coastal (oceanic) lobes is 3.33 Sv (-6.6 Sv) . The discrepancy between these two\n\nestimates might be related, as for transect #3, to the angle at which the ship track crossed the\n\nvortical structure. The resemblance of the vertical structure between the 68-D through and the\n\nBC suggests that both features present similar dynamical mode composition. Further sampling\n\nof the eddies vertical structure ought to be done with longer transects and LADCP profiling\n\ncovering all their extensions.\n\n62\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe goal of this work was to study the subinertial variability of the BC system within the SB,\n\nand in order to accomplish that, we primarily used satellite altimetry data and some traditional\n\nspectral analysis techniques. We also analyzed quasi-synoptic observations of an oceanographic\n\ncruise, which was part of the IOUSP-PETROBRAS CERES Experiment and sampled the whole\n\nSB.\n\nThe BC thickens and, therefore, changes its vertical structure and dynamical modal compo-\n\nsition as it crosses the SB. As it enters the bight by trying to contour CF (23?S), the BC is about\n\n500 m deep and transports TW and SACW. As the current leaves the bight south of CSM (28?S),\n\nit is 1300 m deep and also transports AAIW and UCDW at subpycnocline levels. These differ-\n\nences in thickness and accompanying velocity vertical shear is due to the impinging branch of\n\nthe intermediate SEC and subsequent bifurcation as it hits the slope at central latitudes of the SB.\n\nThis oceanographic feature is referred in the literatures as the SBi.\n\nWe showed that there are different phenomena occurring to the north and to the south of the\n\nbifurcation and this might be caused by the SBi feature itself and/or the consequential change\n\nin the BC jet vertical structure downstream. For this reason, we carried out our investigation\n\nexamining two separate regions: north and south of the SBi axis. We studied the spectra splitting\n\nthe SB domain in the two areas and focused on the two most important peaks at each portion.\n\nThe Northern Study Area\n\nNorth of the SBi, we found a spectrum peak in 175 days which we linked to linear Rossby\n\nwaves, and since it was in the range of semiannual phenomena, we did not further analyzed this\n\nperiod band. The second peak in the northern region of the SB relates to a period of 92 days and\n\n63\n\n\n\na wavelength of 490 km. This wave accounts for ?17% of the BC axis variability and subsequent\ndownstream propagation along the whole SBi extension. By extending our analysis towards the\n\ninterior of the South Atlantic basin, we identified that the 92-day wave signal propagating from\n\nthe east as a wave front and reaching the BC. These waves accounted for about ?21% of the\nSLA variability at 25?S along the front path.\n\nCertainly the question we asked was: what are these waves? Given their nearly-zonal prop-\n\nagation, the northern area spectrum was first compared to the linear first-mode baroclinic plan-\n\netary Rossby waves dispersion curve. However, in order to be classified as so, the 490km wave\n\nwould have to present a much longer period than 92 days. If we keep this period, their critical\n\nlatitude would be 17?S, and the Rossby parameter ? would have to be much larger. As matter of\n\nfact, the identified wave seems to propagate with a phase speed corresponding to a nondisper-\n\nsive linear baroclinic planetary wave of 92 days. We observed that the northern area spectrum\n\nconcentrates energy in the vicinities of the so-called NDL. In particular, the (?,k ) pair for the\n\n92-day/490km wave lies near the NDL. The literature has reported that waves with such char-\n\nacteristics are related to nonlinear vorticity waves. Indeed, we calculated the relation between\n\nadvective and local terms from the momentum equation, and found the nonlinear parameter\n\nfor this wave to be 1.1. Therefore, we conclude that the 92-day oscillations are nonlinear vor-\n\nticity waves, which are originated to the east of 35?W and propagate zonally towards the BC\n\naxis. These waves then perturb the current exciting oscillatory motions of the same period and\n\nwhich propagate downstream. Our results suggest that the southward propagating wave train\n\nare in phase with the incoming zonal wave front and account for 1/5 of the BC variability in the\n\nnorthern area.\n\nThe Southern Study Area\n\nSouth of the SBi axis, we identified two different maxima in the ?, k spectrum calculated\n\nusing the FFT2D. They correspond to oscillations with periods of 68 and 148 days. It should be\n\nmentioned that the third maxima found is associated with the 92-day waves coming from the\n\nnorthern area and propagating south.\n\nThe 148-day wave has a length of ?790 km. It is originated in the ocean interior and we were\nable to track its signal as far as 5?W. Its propagation is nearly zonal to the west. Such as the 92-\n\nday wave described above, this longer wave appears to be a baroclinic first-mode NDL wave. We\n\nindeed estimated the nonlinear parameter as 1.13, virtually matching the classification we gave\n\n64\n\n\n\nto the 92-day wave in the northern area. We however should comment that the critical latitude\n\nof a 148-day linear baroclinic Rossby wave is 29?S. It is therefore possible the existence of\n\nlinear Rossby wave with 148-day period, but with a half wavelength of the estimated signal\n\n(420 km). Therefore, in order to match the linear dispersion curve, one possibility is that the\n\nambient potential vorticity gradient of such waves should include other terms other than the\n\nplanetary ?. The other possibility is an association between a linear wave and a nonlinear eddy,\n\nwhich might propagate at same speed, such as proposed byPolito and Sato (2015). However,\n\ngiven the obtained ?, k spectrum resemblance to the one presented by Wortham and Wunsch\n\n(2014), we classify the 148-day oscillations as nonlinear vorticity waves.\n\nThe second spectrum maximum found south of the SBi was related to oscillations of 68-\n\nday period and 397km wavelength. These waves differ from the previously described ones\n\nbecause their existence is limited to vicinities of the BC. There is no evidence of westward-\n\npropagating wave front coming from the ocean interior. Phase speeds have approximately the\n\nBC axis orientation and they can only be clearly detected between ? 27?S and ? 32?S. This\npropagating signal accounts with a variance of ?21% on the BC axis and almost 28% along the\nwave ray tracing.\n\nDue to its propagation axis and its wavelength, this was the only of three investigated wave-\n\nlengths that was possible to search for the evidence in in situ observational data. In CERES V\n\ncruise (1-23 November 2013), we identified a anticyclone-cyclone pair in the outer edge of the\n\nBC. Using VMADCP data we identified a resemblance between the each eddy and the vertical\n\nstructure of the BC. This possibly suggests a similar dynamic modal composition a direct link\n\namong the features. However, this needs to be further examined since the velocity profiling only\n\nreached 450 m depth and the LADCP observations available reaches only the innermost part of\n\nthe oceanographic transects.\n\nThis wave is directly associated with the BC axis and thus can be related perturbations due\n\nto instability in the current. Despite de recent studies regarding instability of the current, they\n\neither did it with current meter data or did not considered the possible effect of the SBi in the\n\nregion (Rocha et al., 2014; Fernandes et al., 2009).\n\nBy positively testing this thesis hypothesis, we can state that the BC is both locally and\n\nremotely forced. While the remote forcing is associated to impinging westward-propagating\n\nwave fronts with periods of 92 and 148 days. The local forcing seems to produce 68-day\n\noscillations confined to the vicinities of the current axis.\n\n65\n\n\n\n4.1 Future work\n\nFrom this work we were able to better understand the variability scales of the BC within the\n\nSB, but there is still a lot to know and understand about the BC system in this region.\n\nTo better understand the periodic signals identified in the present work, we propose to\n\nprocess-model to the SB domain. The use a QG nonlinear model or even PE model to access\n\nwhat is the forcing of the locally-formed southward propagating waves. The interaction of the\n\nincoming NDL waves with the BC and the topography should also be pursued through process\n\nmodeling. Moreover, the dynamical role of the SBi as a both a hydrodynamic barrier as well as\n\na source for perturbations to the BC and the IWBC should be explored using process modeling.\n\nWe also suggest the use of further studies and analyses using available observational data\n\nfrom both quasi-synoptic and time series of currentmeter moorings. Improved spectral tech-\n\nniques like two dimensional wavelets which do not impose constraints in the results like FFT2D\n\n(i.e. permanent and recurrent features).\n\n66\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\nAnderson, D.
