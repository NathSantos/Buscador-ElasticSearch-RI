Polygonality, mean cell area,\ncell density and coefficient of variation of mean cell area were\nanalyzed. The normal corneal endothelium consisted of\npolygonal cells of uniform size and shape with few\ninterdigitations of the cell borders. Microvilli appeared as\nprotusions on the cellular surface. The average cell area was\n269\u00b118?m2 and the endothelial cell density was 3717\u00b1240cells\nmm-2. The coefficient of variation of the cell area was 0.06, and\nthe percentage of hexagonal cells was 75%. The parameters\nevaluated did not differ significantly between the right and the\nleft eye from the same ostrich. The results of this study showed\nthat the ostrich corneal endothelial cells appear quite similar\nto those of the other vertebrates. \n\nKey words: corneal, endothelium, ostrich, Struthio camelus.\n\nRESUMO\n\nObjetivou-se examinar a superf\u00edcie posterior do\nendot\u00e9lio corneano e realizar an\u00e1lise morfom\u00e9trica das c\u00e9lulas\nendoteliais da c\u00f3rnea de avestruz (Struthio camelus) valendo-\nse da microscopia eletr\u00f4nica de varredura.

The structure of the\nnormal corneal endothelium has been documented in\nhumans (ABIB &amp; BARRETO, 2001), dogs (GWIN et\nal., 1982; PIGATTO et al., 2006; RODRIGUES et al., 2006),\nhorses (ANDREW et al., 2001) and other animal species\n(YEE et al., 1987; COLLIN &amp; COLLIN, 1998; PIGATTO\net al., 2004; PIGATTO et al., 2005a; PIGATTO et al.,\n2005b).   The ostrich (Struthio camelus) is the world\u2019s\nlargest living bird. Native of Africa, these flightless\nbird are important animals in many livestock industries.\nHowever, studies about the corneal endothelium of the\nostrich (Struthio camelus) have not been reported\npreviously, in the referred literature.

These eyes were\nobtained from a licensed Brazilian commercial company\nthat breeds ostriches for meat production.  All\nprocedures were performed in compliance with the\nAssociation for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology\nstatement regarding the use of animals in ophthalmic\nand vision research. Ostriches were killed in a\ncommercial abattoir, using a standard slaughter\nprotocol. After 1 hour of death, eyes were enucleated\nand those one that showed evidence of ocular disease\nwere excluded. The posterior endothelial surfaces were\nexamined and photographed using a scanning electron\nmicroscope operated at 15kV.  Ten photomicrographs\nwere taken from each cornea with magnifications of X\n750, X 1,000, and X 1,500. The photomicrographs were\nscanned into the computer, and polygonality was\ndetermined. With image analyzer software, the cell area\nof 100 endothelial cells from each cornea was measured,\nand mean endothelial cell density was obtained. The\ncoefficient of variation of mean cell area was calculated\nby dividing the standard deviation of the cell area by\nmean cell area. Statistical data analysis was conducted\nusing the Tukey test. Values of P<0.05 were considered\nsignificant.  \n\nThe posterior corneal endothelium surface\nof the ostriches observed on SEM revealed a\ncontinuous layer of polygonal cells of uniform size and\nshape (Figure 1). The cell borders showed few\ninterdigitations. Microvilosities appeared as multiple\nprotusions on cell surface . Cilia were not observed.\nSmall pits were observed scattered over the cell surface.\nRegarding the polygonality of the endothelium, the\nmajority of cells were six-sided (75%), with five- (14%),\nand seven-sided (11%) cells constituting the remaining\ncorneal endothelium. The mean cell area of corneal\nendothelium was 269\u00b118?m2 and the endothelial cell\ndensity was 3717\u00b1240cells mm-2. The coefficient of\nvariation of mean cell area was 0.06. The parameters\nevaluated did not differ significantly between the right\nand the left eye from the same Ostrich.   \n\nDespite of their considerable use, the effects\nof preparation of cornea for SEM on corneal\nendothelium have been described (VIRTANEN et al.,\n1984). SEM, with appropriate consideration of the\neffects of fixation, allows the evaluation of morphology\n\nand morphometric analysis of endothelial cells of\nostrich.\n\nIn most vertebrates the shape of normal\ncorneal endothelial cells shows a mosaic-like pattern\nof polygonal cells (YEE et al., 1987; COLLIN &amp; COLLIN,\n1998; ANDREW et al., 2001; PIGATTO et al., 2004;\nPIGATTO et al., 2005a; PIGATTO et al., 2006). The\npleomorphic characteristics of ostrich corneal\nendothelium are similar to those of man, cat, dog, and\nother vertebrates, where 65-80% of corneal endothelial\ncells area hexagonal (DOUGHTY, 1989; PIGATTO et\nal., 2005a). This study shows endothelial cells with\nminimal variation in size and shape, probably because\nall animals were of the same age, and only healthy\ncorneas were studied. In other species, endothelial\nmorphologic features and cell densities are dependent\non age, with a decrease in endothelial cell density and\ncorresponding increases in cell size and variation in\nshape with age (GWIN et al., 1982).  The coefficient of\nvariation in cell area observed in this study was similar\nto those described in normal corneal endothelium of\nother avians (YEE et al., 1987; PIGATTO et al., 2005). \n\nOur results regarding the ultrastructure of\nthe corneal endothelium of ostrich agree with those\nreported by other authors (YEE et al., 1987; DOUGHTY,\n1989; COLLIN &amp; COLLIN, 1998; PIGATTO et al., 2004;\nPIGATTO et al., 2005a; PIGATTO et al., 2006). Our study\nconfirmed the presence of microvilli distributed over\nthe surface of each endothelial cell. The small microvilli\nprojected from all the endothelial cells have been\ndescribed in other vertebrates (COLLIN &amp; COLLIN,\n1998). In the current investigation, we did not detect\ncilia in the corneal endothelium. However, this structure,\nprotruding into the anterior chamber, was occasionally\nfound in the endothelial cells of humans as well as in\nother animals (GALLAGHER, 1980). The small pits\nobserved scattered over the cell surface probably\nrepresent pinocytotic vesicles, previously documented\n(SVEDBERGH &amp; BILL, 1972). Density of corneal\nendothelial cells using SEM has previously been\nreported in other species (COLLIN &amp; COLLIN, 1998;\nPIGATTO et al., 2004; PIGATTO et al., 2005a;\nRODRIGUES et al., 2006). The cell densities of the\nrepresentative species of birds ranged from\n4.413\u00b1766cells mm-2 to 11.734\u00b11.687cells mm-2 (COLLIN\n&amp; COLLIN, 1998). Our results showed that cell density\nis similar to that found by COLLIN and COLLIN (1998).\nThis study showed that the parameters evaluated did\nnot differ significantly between both eyes from the same\nostrich. Such findings are in agreement with previous\nstudies (TUFT &amp; COSTER, 1990; ANDREW et al., 2001;\nPIGATTO et al., 2004; PIGATTO et al., 2005b).  The\nultrastructure and the morphometric parameters of the\n\n\n\n928 Pigatto et al.\n\nCi\u00eancia Rural, v.39, n.3, mai-jun, 2009.\n\nOstrich corneal endothelium are similar to those\ndescribed in other vertebrates. Furthermore, these data\nwill increase our understanding about the environmental\nconstraints placed on the non mammalian cornea and\nthe evolutionary development of this tissue.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nABIB, F.C.; BARRETO, J.
