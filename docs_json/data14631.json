After 10 years, Petrofac \n\nbecame a Multinational Corporation with an operational center in Sharjah, United Arab \n\nEmirates. In the following years, Petrofac expanded their business globally and was awarded a \n\nlot of projects in different regions.

The board of Petrofac will be analyzed \n\nfrom 5 different factors as following. \n\n \n\n \n\nAyman Asfari \n2002 \n\nGroup Chief Executive \n\n \n\nAlastair Cochran \n2016 \n\nChief Financial Officer \n\n \n\nThomas Thune Andersen \n\n2014 \n\nSenior Independent Director \n\nChairman of the \n\nRemuneration Committee \n\n \n\nAndrea Abt \n2016 \n\nNon-executive Director \n\n \n\nMatthias Bichsel \n2015 \n\nNon-executive Director \n\n \n\nRen\u00e9 M\u00e9dori \n\n2012 \n\nNon-executive Director \n\nChairman of the Audit \n\nCommittee \n\n \n\nGeorge Pierson \n2016 \n\nNon-executive Director \n\n\n\nCompany Overview   \n\n11 \n\n \n\nThe first factor is the size of board, Lipton and Lorsch (1992) put forward that the lack of \n\nmeaningful discussions because of the size of board, which should be limited with a maximum \n\nof 10 members. However, if the size of the board is too small, it will limit the viewpoints. \n\nConversely, the members in a big size board have difficulties to communicate with each other \n\nin a limited time. The board of Petrofac consists of a non-executive chairman, group chief \n\nexecutive, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, senior independent director and four \n\nnon-executive directors. This 8-member board allows directors to know each other well and \n\nhave effective meetings. \n\n \n\nThe second factor is the frequency of meetings. The strategy making, supervision of \n\nmanagement and other relative activities from the board are through board meetings. According \n\nto Korn and Ferry\u2019s survey (1992), the directors would be expected to spend at least 94 hours \n\non board-related business. In Petrofac, besides six scheduled face-to-face meetings, the board \n\nalso communicates via telephone conferences. Additionally, face-to-face meeting were held in \n\nthe form of a two-day conference. Lipton and Lorsch (1992) also suggest additional meetings \n\nresulting in salutary effects. \n\n \n\nImage taken from: Petrofac Annual Report 2016 \n\n \n\nThird, the separation of management and control can help to improve the problem of power, \n\nwhen everything is concentrated on the chairman or CEO. The chairman of Petrofac (Rijnhard \n\nvan Tets) is responsible for leading the board and ensuring the effective board governance and \n\nrepresents the shareholders\u2019 equity. The CEO of Petrofac is Ayman Asfari, who is responsible \n\nfor leading and motivating management team. In addition, Ayman Asfari is the major \n\nshareholder with 62,958,426 shares (18.2%, Table 4). Therefore, Ayman as a major shareholder \n\nand the CEO, has the same goal with the chairman to improve the business performance and \n\nmaximize the equity of shareholders. \n\n\n\nCompany Overview   \n\n12 \n\n \n\n NUMBER OF ORDINARY \nSHARES \n\nPERCANTAGE OF ISSUED \n\nSHARE \n\nAYMAN ASFARI \n\nAND FAMILY \n62,958,426 18.2% \n\nMAROUN SEMAAN \n\nAND FAMILY \n18,034,399 5.2% \n\nTable 4 Major Shareholders - taken from Petrofac Annual Report 2016 \n\nFourth, the intensive plan for the board is an effective way to improve business performance. \n\nThe major shareholders can focus on the long-term development, and avoid the short-term \n\ndecision. The intensive plans are divided into cash and shares. Petrofac has Annual Bonus and \n\nPerformance Share Plans. The award from Annual Bonus is based on the performance in the \n\nrelevant financial year, which can be up to 200% of the basic salary. The Performance Share \n\nPlan strengthens Executive Directors\u2019 performance over the long-run and usually rewards \n\nconditional shares. This is in line with the target about the long-term strategy of company and \n\nalignment with long-run shareholder value. \n\n \n\nFinally, the role of the Independent Director will be analyzed. According to NASDAQ Rule \n\n4200 a(15): \u201cIndependent Director means a person other than an executive officer or employee \n\nof the company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the issuer's \n\nboard of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out \n\nthe responsibilities of a director\u201d (Security and Exchange Commission, 2017). Thomas Thune \n\nAndersen has extensive international experience with well-established knowledge of the energy \n\nindustry and the market. Andrea Abt, Ren\u00e9 M\u00e9dori and George Pierson are non-executive \n\nIndependent Director of the company. While Andrea has a good understand in sales, finance, \n\nprocurement and logistics; Ren\u00e9 has a wide-ranging international financial experience with \n\nstrong background in governance, operational and strategic management. George is a lawyer \n\nand engineer with strong background in risk management, contracting, construction law, \n\ncompliance and cost efficiency. As the results from Dahya &amp; McConnel\u2019s study indicate that \n\nthere is a significant positive correlation between the representation of independent director and \n\nthe board decision. The four Independent Directors are specialists in finance, law, management \n\nrespectively, therefore, they can provide advices from different areas, which can lead to an \n\nimprovement in business performance and ensures that no single individual can dominate the \n\ndecision-making process. \n\n \n\n\n\nCompany Overview   \n\n13 \n\n \n\nPetrofac issued 345,912,747 ordinary shares, which are quoted on the London Stock Exchange. \n\nAccording to the Annual Report 2016, the major shareholders with shares greater than 5% \n\nvoting rights are Ayman Asfari and Maroun Semaan. \n\n \n\nPetrofac shareholdings are composed of 33% retail and \n\ninstitutional 67%. The major regions of shareholders \n\nare from the UK, U.S. and Canada. \n\nPetrofac believes that useful and accessible \n\nengagement is the cornerstone to interact with \n\nshareholders. The Investor Relations team will \n\nschedule meetings with existing and potential \n\nshareholders, analysts and investors. This meeting \n\nconsists of presentations and question &amp; answer \n\nsessions. For some people who cannot attend, the \n\npresentations are streamed by internet. \n\n \n\n \n\nImage taken from: Petrofac Annual Report 2016 \n\n \n\n1.4 Peers \n\nThere are many competitors of Petrofac in the oil and gas market. The major competitors of \n\nPetrofac are Amec Foster Wheeler (AMFW), Hunting (HTG) and John Wood Group (WG). \n\nThe reason why I choose these companies is that they are operating within the FTSE250 with \n\nsimilar business activities. \n\nAmec Foster Wheeler is an international company focused on the Oil, Gas &amp; Chemicals, \n\nMining, Power &amp; Process and Environment &amp; Infrastructure market with more than 160 years \n\nof history. Their business expands to 55 countries, employs around 35,000 staff throughout \n\ntheir global operations. \n\n\n\nCompany Overview   \n\n14 \n\n \n\nHunting is an international company which provides oil and gas services worldwide.

The UK and Middle East \n\neconomy will be discussed in this part as well as the U.S. economy. \n\n2.1 General Economic \n\nReal GDP Worldwide \n\n \n\nImage taken from: World Bank \n\nThe global growth in terms of Real GDP is predicted to accelerate to 2.7% in 2017 and 2.9% \n\nin 2018-2019. As we can see from the Table above, the World Real GDP in 2016 anticipated \n\nto fall from 2.7% (2015) to 2.4% which is in line with the January 2017 projections. The \n\nadvanced economic growth has decreased by 0.4% from 2.1% (2015) to 1.7% (2016) while the \n\ngrowth in EMDEs is projected to accelerate to 4.1% in 2017, up from 3.5% in 2016, before \n\nstrengthening further to 4.5% and 4.7% in 2018-2019. \n\nAs predicted in January, the global activity is picking up and the global growth is expected to \n\nstrengthen in 2017. \n\n\n\nEconomic Analysis   \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 Downside Risks to Global Growth Forecasts \n\nSources from: Bloomberg, Consensus Economics, World Bank. \n\nHowever, according to the world bank report, risk to the global outlook remain titled to the \n\ndownside, which is caused by the increase in the uncertainty of advanced economic policy, \n\nelevated trade protectionism and the possibility of financial market disruptions. Those factors \n\nmay cause a weaker potential global growth in the long-run. \n\n2.2 Major Economy \n\nThe activities in major advanced economies could lead to stronger than expected impacts to the \n\nglobal outlook, notably in the U.S. \n\nIn the 19th century, the UK was the economic superpower in the world, its trading partners \n\nsuffered indirect losses when it was involved in a financial crisis. Until the 20th century, the UK \n\nlost his position and the U.S. has become the largest economy measured by the nominal GDP \n\n($16.58 trillion) which accounts for 24.68% of gross world product in 2016. Figure 4 shows \n\nthat China performs better than the U.S. measured in terms of GDP based on PPP after 2013 \u2013 \n\napproximately $21,269 billion in China compared to $18,562 billion in the U.S. \n\n-0,5\n\n-0,4\n\n-0,3\n\n-0,2\n\nDownside Risks to Global Growth Forecasts\n18-month ahead Median\n\nPercent\n\n\n\nEconomic Analysis   \n\n21 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3 U.S. &amp; China GDP in Constant US$ Dollar \n\nSource from: the World Bank \n\n \n\nFigure 4 U.S. and CHINA GDP based on PPP \n\nSource from: the World Bank \n\nFirst of all, the U.S. has been the leader in the world economic development. The data in Figure \n\n5 is provided from the World Bank from 2000 to 2016 and shows the percentages of the U.S. \n\nof the world GDP. The average value for U.S. during this period is around 26.12%. The \n\nminimum value is 21.55% in 2011 while the maximum is 32.46% in 2001. It indicates that the \n\nU.S. GDP is the major part of the global GDP. This means if the U.S. is hit by an economic \n\nslowdown world GDP will decrease significantly. This can be shown on the example of the \n\nSubprime Mortgage Crisis. A Subprime Mortgage is a type of mortgage which is issued by \n\nlending institutions to low credit borrowers. According to Amadeo (2017), this crisis started in \n\nthe late 2006 and peaking in 2009. The main reason is banks sold too many mortgages to \n\nborrowers with low credit ratings, the falling home prices occurred with defaults. In the \n\n0\n\n5000\n\n10000\n\n15000\n\n20000\n\n25000\n\n30000\n\nB\nil\n\nli\no\n\nn\ns\n\nUS &amp; CHINA GDP ($ billion)\n\nChina US\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nT\nr\nil\n\nli\no\nn\n\ns\n\nGDP based on PPP valuation ($ billion)\n\nChina US\n\n\n\nEconomic Analysis   \n\n22 \n\n \n\nfollowing years (2007-2008), banking crisis, financial crisis and the worst recession occurred \n\ndue to Subprime Mortgage Crisis. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5 U.S. Percent of world GDP \n\nSource from: the World Bank \n\nSecondly, the U.S. implements the trade liberalization policy which leads to global integration. \n\nIn addition, there is a board economic link between the U.S. and the rest of the world. According \n\nto the Economic Complexity Index (ECI), the United States is the 2nd largest export economy \n\nwith $1.38T and largest importer with $2.16T in the world (see Figure 6). As a result, a negative \n\nimpact from the U.S. economy can easily spread out to the world through the interactions in \n\ntrade, financial, monetary, investment, confidence and policy channel. The main cause is the \n\nimport and export trade. When the U.S. is experiencing a recession, there should be a receding \n\nin consumption of residents, the capital expenditure and production of companies, which leads \n\nto a reduce in imports about consumer goods, capital goods, intermediate product and raw \n\nmaterials. The imports of the U.S. are the exports of other countries. Therefore, a decrease in \n\nglobal trade will result in a global economic downturn. \n\n3\n1\n\n,2\n8\n\n3\n2\n\n,4\n6\n\n3\n2\n\n,2\n9\n\n3\n0\n\n,1\n2\n\n2\n8\n\n,4\n8\n\n2\n8\n\n,0\n6\n\n2\n7\n\n,4\n\n2\n5\n\n,3\n9\n\n2\n3\n\n,5\n5\n\n2\n4\n\n,3\n4\n\n2\n3\n\n,0\n3\n\n2\n1\n\n,5\n5\n\n2\n1\n\n,9\n7\n\n2\n2\n\n,2\n9\n\n2\n2\n\n,7\n9\n\n2\n4\n\n,3\n1\n\n2\n4\n\n,6\n8\n\n20\n\n22\n\n24\n\n26\n\n28\n\n30\n\n32\n\n34\n\nU.S. Percent of Wrold GDP %\n\nUAS Percent of Wrold GDP Average\n\n\n\nEconomic Analysis   \n\n23 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6 Trade Balance of U.S. \n\nSource: The Observatory of Economic Complexity \n\nAccording to Figure 7, it can be known that China is the top import origins of the U.S. with \n\n$457 Billion. The reduction of consumption from U.S. residents will directly affect the export \n\nof consumer goods from China to U.S. As a result, exporting Chinese companies will reduce \n\ntheir production and lay off employees. \n\n \n\nFigure 7 The Import Origins OF U.S. \n\nSource: The Observatory of Economic Complexity \n\nThird, the U.S. dollar is the benchmark pricing instrument for most commodities in \n\ninternational trade. Foreign traders purchase or sell goods with dollars. According to the data \n\nreleased by International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the end of March 2017, more than half \n\n(63.96%) of all known central bank foreign currency reserves were denominated in U.S. dollars. \n\nThe following one is Euros, which makes up 19.74% of currency reserves (Figure 8). \n\n0,4\n0,6\n0,8\n\n1\n1,2\n1,4\n1,6\n1,8\n\n2\n2,2\n\nT\nri\n\nll\nio\n\nn\ns\n\nU.S. Trade Balance\n\nExport Import\n\nT H E  I M P O R T  O R I G I N S\n\nCHN CAN MEX JPN DEU KOR GBR\nIND ITA VNM XXB FRA IRL MYS\nTHA CHE ISR BRA OTHER\n\n\n\nEconomic Analysis   \n\n24 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8 World \u2013 Allocated Reserves by Currency for 2016Q4 \n\nSource: International Monetary Fund \n\nThe reason why foreign holders prefer U.S. banknotes is because of the monetary stability. \n\nGoldberg (2010, p2-3) mentioned that the U.S. dollar stipulates an improved medium of \n\nexchange relative to their home currency. However, countries might suffer massive wealth \n\ndestruction, because of the depreciation of the U.S. dollar and even might lead to a global \n\ndeflation. The benefit derived by dollar weakness is the increase of export competitiveness of \n\nU.S., but it is bad news for the import origins of U.S. and the data mentioned before proved that \n\nthe U.S. is a powerful importer. Their home currencies appreciated against U.S. dollar that \n\nmeans there will be a lower export competitiveness of their commodities due to the increasing \n\nprice, which affect the development of economy in export countries directly. \n\n2.3 Other indicators \n\nInflation \n\nThe inflation rate in February 2017 is around 2% within advanced economies, which is more \n\nthan double the rate compared to 2016 (0.8%), with a revival within emerging market driven \n\nby the increase in fuel prices (IMF, 2017). The main reason behind this is that the increased oil \n\nprice between August 2016 and February 2017, with growth rates up to 20%., caused by the \n\nproduction cut agreement from the OPEC. In most advanced economies, headline inflation \n\nremains below central bank targets and the core inflation has been stable. It has remained \n\nW O R L D  - A L L O C AT E D  R E S E R V E S  B Y  \n\nC U R R E N C Y\n\nU.S. Dollars Euros Chinese Renminbi Japanese Yen Pounds Sterling\n\nAustralian Dollars Canadian Dollars Swiss Francs Other Currencies\n\n\n\nEconomic Analysis   \n\n25 \n\n \n\nbroadly stable in emerging economies, whereas Brazil and Russia, experiencing a strong \n\ndecline. \n\nLabor Market \n\n10 years after the global financial crisis, the OECD average employment rate reached pre-crisis \n\nlevels in the Q1 of 2017 and the unemployment rate continues to improve. But unemployment \n\nis still a little higher compared to pre-crisis, which has resulted from the rising participation \n\nlevels and cannot be offset by employment increasing (DECD, 2017). The real wage growth is \n\nslow, the unemployment rate still remains high for part-time jobs. All in all, the employment \n\nindicators are getting better but the whole labor market is still lagging behind. \n\nInvestment, Trade and demand \n\nInvestment and trade are picking up modestly, there are three signals showing the investment \n\nprospects are good: low policy uncertainties; the regulation will promote competition among \n\ninvestors; and the global demand is in uptrend (OECD, 2017). Because of the strong support \n\nfrom China, the global trade has rebound in the last year. Investment is suggested to be in a \n\nhigh-quality capital with advanced technology, which might improve the global investment \n\nchains, but requires the high efficient productivity and output. (World Bank, 2017) \n\nPolicy Uncertainty and Geopolitical Risks \n\nAt first, there is a change in the U.S., Trump brings a shock to the fiscal, trade, and immigration \n\npolicies, which affects companies, investments and new hires. On the other side of the Atlantic, \n\nthe Brexit brings risk to the European economy. \n\nThe geopolitical risks in the Middle East might come with a serious problem of oil and gas and \n\nrefugee flows. The food and water shortages also contribute to risk. The reasons presented in \n\nthis Section bring downside risk and heighten the uncertainty in the world economy. \n\nMiddle East and North Africa (MENA) \n\nA sluggish economic growth in the Middle East and North Africa resulting from the oil \n\nproduction cuts and the fiscal consolidation in recent. Because the influence from the oil \n\nproduction cuts exceeds the bettering circumstances on oil importers, the MENA\u2019s growth has \n\nbeen moderate around 3% during 2015-2016, and is projected to fall to 2.1% in 2017. But the \n\ngrowth is expected to increase to 2.9% in 2018, which based on the low geopolitical risk and \n\nan increasing oil price (World Bank, 2017). After 2017, the oil price is expected to pick up, the \n\n\n\nEconomic Analysis   \n\n26 \n\n \n\nfiscal consolidation is expected to eased, and several public investments (such as Dubai\u2019s World \n\nExpo 2020) are ongoing (Callen et al. 2014). It can be told from these factors that the GDP \n\ngrowth will be remain low in the fiscal year of 2017 and increase thereafter.  \n\nOil and Gas \n\nCrude oil price rose 8% in Q1 2017 with the support of OPEC production cuts agreement, the \n\ngas prices increased 6% in the Q1 2017 on the stronger demand and production restrictions \n\n(World Bank, 2017). It should be mentioned that the main driver of the price fluctuation are the \n\nsupply and demand dynamics. In the following years, the oil price is projected to increase as \n\nglobal supply will fail to satisfy the demand. In the other hand, weaker compliance concerning \n\nproduction cuts might affect the supply and demand balance again. \n\n \n\n\n\nIndustry Analysis   \n\n27 \n\n \n\n3 Industry Analysis \n\nIn the previous sections, the macro effects have been discussed. In this section, Porter\u2019s Five \n\nForces and SWOT analysis will be used to analyze the Oil and Gas Equipment and Services \n\nSector. Then, I determine the current stage of Petrofac in industry life cycle as well as the \n\nmacro and micro level of industry. \n\n \n\n3.1 Porter\u2019s Five Force Model \n\nPorter\u2019s Five Forces Model focuses on the industry analysis, which is based on the assumption \n\nthat industries have boundaries. It is a microscopic analysis of the external environment, which \n\nindicates the average profit margins of a company in the industry. Therefore, it is a \n\nmeasurement of industry situation rather than the capacity of a company. Determining which \n\nmarket need to be analyzed is the first step. Petrofac is an international company, their projects \n\nspan over 29 countries, so it will be analyzed in a worldwide scope. \n\n \n\n3.1.1 Bargaining Power of Buyers \n\nAccording to Athanasios Pitatzis (2017), there are different types of buyers \u2013 refineries, \n\nNational Oil Companies (NOC), International Oil and Gas Companies, Distribution Companies, \n\nTraders and Countries (USA, China, Japan, etc.). But all of them are Oil &amp; Gas Companies, \n\ntherefore, the composition of the buyers is single. The business performance of Oil Equipment \n\nand Services Companies is closely tied to oil and gas companies. Most of the oil and gas \n\ncompanies require the strict market access and evaluation system. For these reasons, there is a \n\nstrong bargaining power of buyers in oil equipment and services sector. \n\n \n\n3.1.2 Bargaining Power of Suppliers \n\nThe global oil and gas chain can be divided into three parts: Upstream, Mid-Stream and \n\nDownstream. The whole chain includes designing, building, maintaining facilities; transporting, \n\nstoring, processing oil and gas and refining. \n\n\n\nIndustry Analysis   \n\n28 \n\n \n\n \n\nImage taken from: Slideshare https://www.slideshare.net/theoacheampong/theo-acheampong-presentation \n\nThe suppliers in the Oil and Gas Equipment and Services Sector are the suppliers who provide \n\nthe technology and the equipment. There are a large number of the suppliers worldwide who \n\nhave a large impact on the Sector. However, a special phenomenon exists here, many equipment \n\nand services providers are competitors as well. Valerus Compression Services, L.P., a United \n\nStated-based company, is one of the suppliers of Petrofac. At the meantime, this company is \n\ndoing the same things as Petrofac, they provide products and services for oil and gas companies. \n\nFor this type of company, as a competitor, they intended to invest hugely in research and \n\ndevelopment (R&amp;D) in order to improve their competitiveness in the industry; but as a supplier, \n\nthey set strict limits on their equipment and service provision. Due to these factors, the suppliers \n\nhave a greater impact with strong bargaining power in Oil and Gas Equipment and Services \n\nSector. \n\n \n\n3.1.3 Threat of New Entrants \n\nAs mentioned above, Petrofac is vertical integrated, their business involvement on all of the \n\nsegments of Oil and Gas Value Chain, especially the upstream. And the Oil and Gas Equipment \n\nand Services Sector can be divided into five different subsectors: Exploration, Drilling, \n\nCompletion, Production and Capital Equipment and Offshore Services. For different subsectors, \n\ndifferent technology or equipment is required, which requires companies to have relatively \n\nstrong R &amp;D capacity and huge investments. At present, most leading oil service providers have \n\na considerable number of patents which reflects its high level of technology. According to a \n\nresearch form Espacenet, Schlunberger is the biggest oilfield service company in the world with \n\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/theoacheampong/theo-acheampong-presentation\n\n\nIndustry Analysis   \n\n29 \n\n \n\nmore than 36,000 patents. In comparison with Halliburton and Backer Hughes, which have \n\n25,000 and 20,000 patents. \n\nPitatzis, A. (2016) mentioned that most countries have their state-owned national oil and gas \n\ncompanies, and these national oil and gas companies control more than 90% of the oil and gas \n\nreserves. These national companies always have their own cooperative partners, so this is \n\nanother weakness for new entrants. \n\nIn the future, with the entire oil industry transforming from conventional energy to \n\nunconventional energy, the technical requirements will be higher and more complex. Big oil \n\nand gas companies have grown significantly in their business life, in the meantime, they \n\ndevelop their R&amp;D, improve the technology, which bring a cost advantage to company and \n\nfurther strengthen the barriers to new entrants. \n\n \n\n3.1.4 Threat of Substitutes \n\nThe main current alternatives for oil and gas are: Nuclear Energy, Coal, Hydrogen, Biofuels \n\nand other renewables sources (Solar and wind energy). Hence, the alternatives for Oil \n\nEquipment and Services Company are the companies who provide the service for other energy. \n\n \n\nImage taken from: Petrofac Annual Report 2016 \n\nUnder the new policies scenario, International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated the world \n\nprimary energy demand by 2040. It can be seen from the Image, the demand for oil will increase \n\nslightly to 4775 M tone per day. Meanwhile, the gas demand is forecasted to grow by more \n\nthan 50%. It can be said that the renewables energy may not be able to become the main energy \n\nin the long period. \n\n\n\nIndustry Analysis   \n\n30 \n\n \n\nThe Financial Times (2017) reported that in 2015, the last deep-pitcoalmine (Kellingley) in the \n\nUK was officially closed. The British government also announced in the run-up to the \n\nDecember 2015 adoption of the Paris climate change accord that they wanted to phase out coal \n\npower by 2025. With the increasing of importance of environment, the using of oil and gas have \n\nbeen encouraged, the proportion of coal consumption is gradually decreasing whereas the \n\nproportion of oil and gas consumption is growing. Overall, it seems that there is few threat of \n\nthe substitutes in Oil and Gas Equipment and Services Sector. \n\n \n\n3.1.5 Competitive Rivalry \n\nOil, equipment and services market is a monopolistic competition market with strong \n\ncompetition, due to the large number of segments and the high technical requirements, and the \n\ndifferent services, products from different companies. For example, some grow up with \n\ntechnical advantage, some have a value chain advantage that relies on the vertical integration, \n\nand some monopoly companies get ahead because of their monopolization. Petrofac is a typical \n\nvertical integrated company which is involved throughout the value chain, from designing to \n\nmarketing. Services include concluding contracts with the energy end market, helping \n\ncompanies to manage the operations based on changing market demands. Less influence from \n\nthe oil price volatilities are brought to bear on Petrofac, because the company can hedge profits \n\nagainst declining price by expending the profit margins in refining operations. \n\nThe high exit barrier is another difficult situation for firms. Equipment as the major capital of \n\na company whereas R &amp; D expenditure and other intangible assets might be hard to recover \n\ndue to the specification. \n\n\n\nIndustry Analysis   \n\n31 \n\n \n\n3.1.6 Summary of porter\u2019s five model \n\n \n\nFigure 9 Porter\u2019s Five Model Result \n\nFigure 9 represents that the bargaining power of buyers is relatively high as the threat of new \n\nentrants is low. The high exit barrier and the difficulty recovering the investment lead to a high \n\ncompetitive rivalry. \n\n  \n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nBargaining Power of\n\nBuyers\n\nBargaining Power of\n\nSuppliers\n\nThreat of New EntrantsThreat of Substitutes\n\nCompetitive Rivalry\n\n\n\nIndustry Analysis   \n\n32 \n\n \n\n3.2 SWOT Analysis  \n\n3.2.1 Strength  \n\n? As mentioned above, Petrofac is an integrated company, compared to other independent \n\ncompany, it can get a balance from upstream and downstream operations to hedge \n\nprofits against the market recessions. \n\n? With 35-year operating experience, Petrofac has built a strong reputation in the market. \n\n? A reorganization of Petrofac has been implemented in January 2016, in order to meet \n\nclient requirements from a changing environment, such as the Middle East and North \n\nAfrica. \n\n? The core value of Petrofac is \u201cSAFE\u201d. The high potential incidents (HiPos) rate has \n\nfallen from 0.063 (2015) to 0.039 (2016) (Petrofac, Annual report and account 2016, \n\np.54) which is an excellent safety record. Petrofac\u2019s performance keeps substantially \n\nahead of industry norms. \n\n? There is a strong risk management system in Petrofac (image shown below). This helps \n\nthe management to seize opportunities despite it operates in a challenging environment.  \n\n \n\nImage taken from: Petrofac Annual Report 2016 \n\n? With Petrofac operating in 29 countries, the group employs approximately 13,500 staff \n\nin the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Americas, Asia Pacific, India and CIS, even though \n\nthere is a decline in employee numbers in 2016. This strong workforce ensures that the \n\ngroup can keep operating even when one region stagnates. \n\n\n\nIndustry Analysis   \n\n33 \n\n \n\n? Oil and Gas Equipment and Services Sector is a technology intensive sector, the \n\nengineering teams of Petrofac keep finding new techniques to delivery efficiency \n\ncombined with cost optimization. \n\n3.2.2 Weakness  \n\n? The industry is capital intensive, large amounts of investment are needed at the \n\nbeginning, and it takes a long time to generate profit from the investment. \n\n? The industry is in close ties with the oil and gas industry, hence there is a strong \n\ncorrelation between the performance of IES in Petrofac and oil and gas price volatility. \n\nRecently the low price and the uncertainty in forward price influence the level of \n\ninvestment, development and business activity within the industry. \n\n? The number of contracts are relatively small with large value in Petrofac, the \n\ntermination of contract will bring a significant impact on financial performance. \n\n3.2.3 Opportunities \n\n? As it was mentioned before, the use of coal in the world is declining whereas oil and \n\ngas as a main energy is encouraged to use. The demand of oil and gas will be \n\nstrengthening further. \n\n3.2.4 Threats \n\n? The political risk remains a significant threat in this industry, notably Petrofac which \n\nhas to face possibility of regime change and legal or regulatory changes. Petrofac should \n\nkeep an eye on the Middle East and North Africa because of the exposure to policy \n\nchanges. \n\n? Until 2015, more than 80% of crude oil reserves are located in OPEC countries, but at \n\nthe end of May 2017, OPEC announced the oil supply cut until March 2018, the OPEC \n\nand non-OPEC members agree with it (Meredith, 2017). Oil companies are the main \n\ncustomer of the industry, the oil supply cut might bring along a declining demand in \n\nequipment and service industry. \n\n? A strong international competition exists in this industry. The most market is occupied \n\nby three major oil equipment and service companies: Schlumberger, Halliburton and \n\nBaker Hughes, resulting from technical monopoly. \n\n \n\n\n\nIndustry Analysis   \n\n34 \n\n \n\n3.3 Industry Life Cycle &amp; Macro Economics \n\nFinch and Acha (2008) suggest that oil related equipment and services are at the mature stage \n\nof the industry life cycle with mature technology, stable and clear industry competition and user \n\ncharacteristic. This sector is a monopolistic competition market with significant high entry \n\nbarriers, and it is getting difficult to develop new technologies. Some large firms dominate most \n\nof the market, such as Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes, and there is a strong \n\ncompetition among the others for the rest of the market. It leads to a situation that all of the end \n\nproducts are homogeneous without product differentiation. \n\n \n\nThere is a strong correlation between the performance of FTSE oil equipment and service sector \n\nand the price of oil and gas, and the investment of this industry relies on the stable and healthy \n\noil &amp; gas prices. The prices are determined by many factors, especially the dynamic relationship \n\nbetween the supply and demand. Moreover, there is a long-term inverse relationship between \n\ncrude oil and gas prices and the value of the dollar (Kowalski, 2017). The current spot dollar \n\nindex gradually increased to 96.963 index points (6/26/2017) compared to 80 index points in \n\nmid-2014 against other foreign exchange instruments. Whereas the crude oil WTI future price \n\nfell down from $105.37 in June 1,2014 to $43.84 in June 27, 2017 (Investing, 2017) \n\n \n\nFigure 10 Oil and Gas and Sector Real Price Monthly \n\nMonthly Real Gas, Oil Future Price and Real Sector Index calculated in excel \n\nBased on Natural Gas Price (NG), Brent Crude Oil Price (CLQ7)  \n\nand FTSE ALL SHARE Oil Equipment &amp; Services (FTAXS0570).  \n\nSource: Thomson Reuters \n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nju\nl-\n\n0\n6\n\nd\ne\nz\n-0\n\n6\n\nm\na\ni-\n\n0\n7\n\no\nu\nt-\n\n0\n7\n\nm\na\nr-\n\n0\n8\n\na\ng\n\no\n-0\n\n8\n\nja\nn\n\n-0\n9\n\nju\nn\n\n-0\n9\n\nn\no\nv\n\n-0\n9\n\na\nb\n\nr-\n1\n0\n\nse\nt-\n\n1\n0\n\nfe\nv\n\n-1\n1\n\nju\nl-\n\n1\n1\n\nd\ne\nz\n-1\n\n1\n\nm\na\ni-\n\n1\n2\n\no\nu\nt-\n\n1\n2\n\nm\na\nr-\n\n1\n3\n\na\ng\n\no\n-1\n\n3\n\nja\nn\n\n-1\n4\n\nju\nn\n\n-1\n4\n\nn\no\nv\n\n-1\n4\n\na\nb\n\nr-\n1\n5\n\nse\nt-\n\n1\n5\n\nfe\nv\n\n-1\n6\n\nju\nl-\n\n1\n6\n\nd\ne\nz\n-1\n\n6\n\nm\na\ni-\n\n1\n7\n\nOil Gas Sector REAL Price\n\nRG RO RINDEX\n\n\n\nIndustry Analysis   \n\n35 \n\n \n\nIt can be seen from Figure 10 above, there is a strong positive correlation between the Brent oil \n\nprice, Natural Gas price and the FTSAX0570.

The period from 2005-\n\n2008 were boom years for the industry, peak price of FTAXS was 19,100.32 GBP on Jun 1st \n\n2008. From there on the price has fallen sharply and reached a low of 8,568.42 GBP due to the \n\nglobal financial crisis of 2008. \n\n \n\nImage taken from: Investing.com \n\nSchlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes are the top three in the industry. The picture \n\nabove presents the WTI oil future price and stocks of the three companies. We can see directly \n\nthat the stock prices are consistent with oil price, and the time when extreme points occurred \n\nare highly synchronized. Moreover, there were some rebounds recently, the stock prices \n\nrecovered at the same time as the rebound occurred or even early. \n\n \n\nMarket fundamentals are projected to be robust in the long-term, the energy demand is expected \n\nto grow by 30% until 2040 because of the new policies scenario - Decarburization (450) \n\nscenario (Petrofac, 2016). Oil price is set to continue to increase in the coming years, which has \n\na positive impact on the equipment and services industry. The investment activity will see an \n\n\n\nIndustry Analysis   \n\n36 \n\n \n\nupturn and the growth in China is set to strengthening further in the second half of 2017. The \n\nmarket stability is predicted to increase in line with above factors. \n\n\n\nIndustry Analysis   \n\n37 \n\n \n\n3.4 Correlation with Gas and Oil \n\nPetrofac provides services to the oil and gas production and processing industry, therefore, the \n\ngas and oil price will be focused on. From Figure 11 and 12, we can see a significant positive \n\ncorrelation. The Sector (FTSAX0570) shows a higher correlation with real crude oil price with \n\nR\u00b2 = 0.2530 compared to the gas price with R\u00b2 = 0.0056.

In \n\n2016, the business secret data has been moved to new data centers. Moreover, company \n\ninvested heavily in cyber intrusion detection and prevention tools. Additionally, cyber seminars \n\nwere held to raise awareness for employee. \n\nLack of Effective Talent \n\nIt should be highlighted that the products of Oil and Gas Equipment and Services Sector are \n\nhomogeneous, the company wants to be ahead with the help of employee\u2019s knowledge. To \n\nsolve the lack of employee with insufficient skills and experiences, Petrofac developed a \n\nsystematic talent performance management and leadership excellence program. \n\nFinancial Capacity \n\nPetrofac maintains a healthy capital by using a mixture of external and internal financing. The \n\ncapital of equity has been calculated as 4.66% via CAPM. In order to fund ongoing projects, \n\nPetrofac needs more finance in the future so that the company is exposed to liquidity risk. The \n\nboard has defined a maximum level of leverage, and improved the debt position over 2016 to \n\navoid the losing of financial capacity. As shown on the balance sheet, there is a 10% reduction \n\nin Net Debt from US $686 million to US $617 million (2015), while they are projecting to \n\ncomplete a global cash management program in 2017. \n\nInterest Rate \n\nAccording to Annual Report 2016, the interest rate risk arising from Petrofac\u2019s long-term debt \n\nrate and its cash and bank balances. The company works against its interest cost by mixing the \n\nfixed and variable debt rate, the cash and bank balances are using floating rates. \n\nForeign currency risk \n\nPetrofac uses US dollar to calculate almost all of the financial capital, as the operations has \n\nbeen spread to 29 countries. This makes the company vulnerable to exposure against the \n\nexchange rate. The forward exchange contracts are used to hedge this risk. In the end of 2016, \n\na series of contracts have been formed during January 2017 to June 2019 \n\nCost of Equity \n\n\n\nRisk and Return   \n\n45 \n\n \n\nCapital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) should be used to value the company through the cost of \n\nequity, which describes the relationship of the systematic risk and expected return of the stock. \n\nExpected Return Formula: \n\n??  =  ?? + ?(?? \u2013  ??) \n\nWhere: \n\n??  : Expected Return on Asset (Cost of Equity)  \n\n? : Beta, Systematic Risk \n\n ??: Risk Free Rate \n\n?? \u2013  ??  : Risk Premium \n\n \n\nAccording to Burfield, the Gilts are the most common benchmark in UK, and our data collected \n\nfor five-year period.

In 2016, Petrofac \n\nimproved their free cash flow position with a 10% reduction in Net Debt to US$617 million \n\nbecause of a strong cash generation, but the 56.2% Net Gearing Ratio is still high which \n\nreflecting a greater risk. However, interest bearing debt brings a major benefit from tax since it \n\n\n\nCapital Structure   \n\n48 \n\n \n\nis tax deductible. The above Table shows that there is a dramatic increase in effective tax rate, \n\nwhich led to a great tax benefit. A reduction in finance leads interest costs to offset the increase \n\nin debt interest expenses since the finance cost remained unchanged in 2016. The graphic below \n\nshows the equity and debt, the debt amount has increased over the past 5 years. The D/E ratio \n\nhas a significant increase from 0.23 to 2.12, which stipulates a high level of debt within the \n\ncompany. \n\n \n\nFigure 20 Debt-Equity \n\nThe weighted average cost of capital (WACC) helps to measure the cost of capital for a firm. \n\nEquity is measured by the market capitalization ($1,868.48 Million).

However, Moody\u2019s Investors Service has announced on 31st May 2017 that they \n\nhave downgraded the rating of Petrofac to a Ba1 rating, the spread is 2.50%. There is a big \n\ndifference between self-calculate rating and the Moody\u2019s rating, because the rating is not only \n\na reflection of statistical factors, the principle of rating includes an appraisal of long-term risks. \n\nInterest Coverage \n\nMillion \n\n2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 \n\nEBITDA 704 312 935 1031 883 \n\nEBIT 516 112 691 793 758 \n\nInterest Expenses 91 97 73 24 - \n\nAverage Interest Exp. 71.25     \n\n      \n\nInterest Coverage \n\n(Earning-based) \n\n5.67 1.15 9.47 33.04 - \n\nAverage Interest Coverage  \n\n(2013-2016) \n\n12.3325     \n\n \n\nThe interest coverage in 2016 shows that the earning can give an excellent protection and a \n\nhigh liquidity for the company whereas the Moody\u2019s rating is in line with the net gearing ratio \n\nthat there is a serious default issue, which increases the uncertainty of profitability, even there \n\nis just a slight sudden increase in interest rate or a recession. Furthermore, the financial penalty \n\nwill happen with a long-term influence for financial leverage (Moody, 2017). \n\nTable 15 Leverage &amp; Liquidity \n\nThe Quick Ratio and Current Ratio of Petrofac are the lowest compared to FTSE250 and the \n\nOil and Gas Equipment and Services Industry. The quick ratio of 0.77 means that Petrofac has \n\nonly US$0.77 liquid assets available to cover 1-dollar current liabilities.

The Board forecasted that \n\nthe company has been placed in a stressful situation against several risks that might affect its \n\nfuture financial activities, the risks include the decline in oil price, the reduction in future orders, \n\nthe poor performance of E&amp;P Services, the increase in working capital and a significant \n\n\n\nDividend Policy   \n\n52 \n\n \n\nfinancial loss. In considering all of the impacts, the company might decrease the dividends in \n\nthe following years. \n\n \n\n\n\nRatio Analysis   \n\n53 \n\n \n\n7 Ratio Analysis \n\nIn this section, the key ratio from Financial Statement will be analyzed to measure the \n\nperformance of Petrofac compared to the Market benchmark, Sector and competitors.

P/E Ratio \n\nindicates the current valuation of the company, and the high ratio means the investors believe \n\nthat profits of the company are stunning in the long-run, they are willing to bear high risk in \n\norder to get a better return. All of the other ratios are following a slight downward trend. But it \n\nshould be noticed that every ratio of Petrofac has been elevated in 2016, as the revenues were \n\nup by 15% to US$7.9 billion, a strong growth happened in the net profit to US$1 million in \n\n2015. Ayman Asfari (Chief Executive) said, the large order backlog (US$14.3 billion) brings \n\nthe company excellent revenue prospects for 2017.

First of all, it can be seen from \n\nthe P/E Ratio that Amec Foster Wheeler and Hunting got worse in the recent 2 years, while the \n\nmarket still remains at the same level. There is a slight change in current valuation, the market \n\ngot a higher P/E Ratio. Then the other ratio of Amec, Hunting are in line with the P/E Ratio \n\noverall trend. \n\nFrom both sides (current and history), the P/E Ratio indicates that Petrofac are overpriced. On \n\nthe other hand, the investors are paying more for each unit of profit as a result of the high P/E \n\nRatio. But for cyclical companies in the oil or oil services industry the period of extreme high \n\nP/E Ratio might be a suitable time to enter the market for investors. \n\n7.2 DuPont Analysis \n\nUS$ Million 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 \n\nTax Complement 0.83 0.82 0.70 - 0.01 \nNet Inc./Pre-tax Inc. 632/765 650/789 120/171 - 1/100 \n\nOperating Margin 12.2% 12.2% 3.5% -3.7% 2.4% \nOp.

At first, increasing Total Assets have been \n\ndriven by a strong cash generation and short-term investments, an increase in Inventory and \n\nProperty &amp; Plant &amp; Equipment. And it can be found from the Total Assets, the Non-Current \n\nassets has remained the same level, around US$2000-3000 million while current assets have \n\nincreased from US$3,218 million in 2012 to US$6,018 million in 2016. However, the Asset \n\nTurnover Ratio is moving down during 2012-2015, even though the Revenue has been in an \n\nuptrend, as the growth rate of Revenue is lower than Total Assets. This indicates the efficiency \n\nof Petrofac to deploy assets for revenue generation declined over the period, and the key driver \n\nis the low utilization efficiency of Current Assets in production and business operations. \n\n\n\nRatio Analysis   \n\n58 \n\n \n\n2012-2015 is a challenging period for the Oil and Gas Equipment and Services industry, the \n\nlarge decrease in oil price (from US$98.78/BBL in 2012 to 36.6 in 2015) forced oil companies \n\nto cut down investments, which brought a decrease in Net Profit Margin to the whole industry. \n\nOnly John Wood Group still keeps profitable performance. In 2016, the oil picked up modestly \n\nto 53.72, Petrofac\u2019s Net Profit Margin was in line and got back to positive. \n\nThe D/E ratio of company reflect the impact of Financial Leverage Ratio on ROE, the company \n\ncan increase their debt to get a high ROE despite weak operating profits. The Financial \n\nLeverage of Petrofac in 2016 (7.21) was around twice the Leverage in 2012 (3.81), and the D/E \n\nratio stands at 2.12, which is extremely high compared to the industry medium (0.38). We need \n\nto be cautious about the ROE with a rapid rising debt and weak profits.  \n\n \n\n7.3 EV/Financial Metrics \n\nPFC 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Current \n\n       \n\nEV 8,751.80 7,634.82 5,012.39 5,090.48 4,337.56 2,745.38 \n\n       \n\nEV/Revenue 1.4 1.21 0.8 0.74 0.55 0.35 \n\nEV/EBITDA 9.79 7.53 5.68 17.2 6.32 3.99 \n\nEV/EBIT 11.46 9.84 7.86 53.03 8.71  \n\nEV/OCF - - 7.74 7.61 6.66  \n\nEV/FCF - - 28.16 10.18 8.93  \n\nTable 25 Petrofac EV \n\nAMFW 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Current \n\n       \n\nEV 2,921.08 3,119.28 4,095.78 2,641.60 2,905.88 2,822.03 \n\n       \n\nEV/Revenue 0.71 0.78 1.03 0.48 0.53 0.52 \n\nEV/EBITDA 9.07 9.54 13 58.7 - - \n\nEV/EBIT 10.94 11.64 16.38 - -  \n\nEV/OCF 12.07 13 28.05 18.73 21.06  \n\nEV/FCF 14.04 14.37 35.62 25.65 25.95  \n\nTable 26 Amec Foster Wheeler EV \n\nHTG 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Current \n\n       \n\nEV 2,172.47 2,144.60 1,390.08 806.85 1,288.68 1039.04 \n\n       \n\n\n\nRatio Analysis   \n\n59 \n\n \n\nEV/Revenue 1.66 1.66 1.00 1.00 2.83 2.28 \n\nEV/EBITDA 8.82 8.85 4.98 12.89 - - \n\nEV/EBIT 13.47 13.84 7.55 - -  \n\nEV/OCF 13.09 11.91 6.06 5.67 28.77  \n\nEV/FCF 23.31 20.17 10.72 12.97 54.84  \n\nTable 27 Hunting EV \n\nWG 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Current \n\n       \n\nEV 4,568.52 4,537.30 3,841.52 3,763.21 4,479.57 3,443.62 \n\n       \n\nEV/Revenue 0.75 0.79 0.58 0.75 1.09 0.84 \n\nEV/EBITDA 9.50 8.93 6.84 7.98 12.46 9.57 \n\nEV/EBIT 13.00 12.55 9.22 11.91 21.23  \n\nEV/OCF 23.73 11.79 8.35 8.07 23.64  \n\nEV/FCF 69.96 18.19 10.98 9.81 43.62  \n\nTable 28 John Wood Group EV \n\nFTSE250 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Current \n\n       \n\nEV/Revenue 0.75 0.79 0.58 0.75 1.09 10.3 \n\nEV/EBITDA 9.50 8.93 6.84 7.98 12.46 30.13 \n\nEV/EBIT 16.68 22.50 17.99 22.97 31.25  \n\nTable 29 FTSE250 EV \n\nSector Avg. 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Current \n\n       \n\nEV 2,987.13 2,997.48 2,118.61 2,021.49 2,093.79 1614.62 \n\n       \n\nEV/Revenue 0.87 0.90 1.21 1.15 1.27 1.21 \n\nEV/EBITDA 9.26 7.72 6.46 16.02 6.34 6.14 \n\nEV/EBIT 13.18 10.82 8.59 17.02 11.47  \n\nTable 30 FTASX0570 EV \n\nEnterprise Value is an advantageous instrument to value companies with different capital \n\nstructures, which is a better indicator compared with P/E Ratio, as EV considers the Liquid \n\nAsset, outstanding Debt and cash equivalents which can affect the market valuation of a \n\ncompany greatly. \n\nLynch, P and Rothchild, J mention that it does not make sense to buy a cyclical with low P/E \n\nratio after several years of record earnings, which might make you lose half your investment \n\n\n\nRatio Analysis   \n\n60 \n\n \n\nduring a short time (1994).

It is obvious that EV/EBITDA Ratio of \n\nPetrofac is broadly in line with the Sector, although the ratio is a little lower than the Sector in \n\n2016, it still can tell that Petrofac could be a good choice for making an investment. \n\nThe whole Market performed better than the Sector because of the continued strong world \n\neconomy, but the oil industry recovery will take longer than projected. The ratio of Wood Group \n\nkept in a stable level during observation, it seems to be the most competitive one within the \n\nSector with a 15.1% gearing ratio and 14.1 interest cover ratio, even the gearing ratio trending \n\nupward from 6.9% in 2012 to 15.1% in 2016. The debt financing should be encouraged in Wood \n\nGroup, which will be cheaper than issuing equity. \n\n  \n\n0,00\n\n10,00\n\n20,00\n\n30,00\n\n40,00\n\n50,00\n\n60,00\n\n70,00\n\nPFC AMFW HTG WG FTSE250 SECTOR\n\nEV/EBITDA\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 CURRENT\n\n\n\nProjection   \n\n61 \n\n \n\n8 Projection \n\n8.1 Macroeconomic &amp; Industry \n\nReal GDP Growth % 2016 2017E 2018E 2019E \n\n     \nWorld 2.4 2.7 2.9 2.9 \n\nAdvanced Economies 1.7 1.9 1.8 1.7 \n\nEMDEs 3.5 4.1 4.5 4.7 \n\nUS 1.6 2.1 2.2 1.9 \n\nChina 6.3 6.2 6.1 6.1 \n\nTable 31 Real GDP Projection \n\nOil - Brent 2016 2017E 2018E 2019E \n     \n\nPrice US$ per barrel 44.0 54.2 55.1 54.8 \n\nGrowth%  23.18 1.66 -0.54 \n\nTable 32 Oil Price Projection \n\nThe World Economy is projected to pick-up modestly starting from the second half of 2017, \n\nbecause of the long-awaited cyclical recovery in global trade and manufacturing. \n\nFor Advanced Economies, Europe and Japan are expected to gain supported by the cyclical \n\nrecovery in 2016. Since the 2016 U.S. Elections the fiscal policy easing was reflected to \n\nincrease which encouraged the U.S. dollar to be stronger against other currencies and U.S. \n\nTreasury interest rates to increase. In addition, there is a continued growth in UK because of \n\nthe spending resists the impact of the June 2016 referendum for Brexit. \n\nA mixed performance across EMDEs, the resource misallocation, the reliance on a loose policy \n\nand the continued rapid credit expansion make the mid-term projected performance to be \n\nclouded. An economic rebalancing just completed in China, which let the GDP growth to be \n\nlower but still in a high level. India is expected to gain speed, but it will be offset by Chinese \n\nslowing growth to some extent. As a representative of commodity exporters, Brazil is predicted \n\nto get out of the most serious recessions, which can be traced back to the policy uncertainty \n\ndiminishing and fiscal policy easing. In addition, a fiscal turnaround in Russia is emerging \n\nbecause of the recovery in oil price. \n\nAs mentioned before, with the support of the agreement about cutting the crude oil output for \n\nsix months among the members of OPEC, the oil prices could be able to increase, which will \n\nstimulate investment in this filed with oil demand improving. The oil demand will increase up \n\n\n\nProjection   \n\n62 \n\n \n\nto 99 million barrels/day by 2021, OPEC projected that in 2016 World Oil Outlook Report, and \n\nthere should be significant investment needed. But in the short-term, a revenue decline is still \n\nprojected to come up, which is driven by the decrease in output. \n\n \n\n8.2 Firm Specific \n\nWith the long-awaited oil price beginning to pick up (but still in a low level), the confidence in \n\nthe industry is expected to increase in the coming years. The Middle East and North Africa \n\n(MENA) region are the major customers for oil and gas related services. Petrofac has been \n\npositioned in the top of region\u2019s EPC Contractor list, ranked by Arabian Oil and Gas Magazine. \n\nAs a core customer, NOC is continued to invest heavily in Petrofac based on their strong and \n\nwell-established relationship. Only few upstream investments within IES has exposure to low \n\noil price, but the revenue in the following year may endanger the dividend from the substantial \n\nfalling-off in backlog from US$20.7bn in 2016 to US$14.3bn in 2017.  \n\n \n\nNet Profit Margin \n\nThe Net Profit Margin is a ratio of Net Income after Tax divided by Revenue, which is a good \n\nindicator of the health of the company. In the first half of 2017, Petrofac delivered $135 million \n\nNet Income, based on the strong Backlog in 2016. For the projection, the average Profitability \n\nGrowth during 2012-2016 will be assumed as 3.446% which can be seen from the Table below \n\nand is the growth for following years. \n\nNP Margin 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 \n\nPetrofac 10.13% 10.27% 1.92% -5.10% 0.01% \n\nProfitability Growth 3.446%     \n\nSector 3.76% 9.67% 9.27% 1.10% -6.95% \n\nAverage 3.37%     \n\nTable 33 NP Margin Projection \n\n \n\nDividend Growth \n\nThe significant Dividend Pay-out Ratio 22372% in 2016 presents that the dividends paid are \n\nnot well covered by Net Profits. As the Net Income is only $1Million in 2016, but the Board \n\n\n\nProjection   \n\n63 \n\n \n\nthought that the dividend is the most important thing for their shareholders. The board proposed \n\na final dividend of 43.8 cents per share by using up Retained Earnings. This give rise to doubts \n\nwhether the dividend can be keep at this level in the following years or not. The dividend growth \n\nrate will be calculated for every year on average, which can be seen from the Table 35 below. \n\nYear 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Average \n       \n\nPay-out Ratio% 34.43% 34.52% 186.98% -64.10% 22372.00%  \n\nROE 47.483% 36.744% 6.234% -22.574% 0.086%  \n\nGrowth Rate 31.13% 24.06% -5.42% -37.05% -19.13% -1.28% \n\nTable 34 Dividend Projection \n\nGrowth Rate Formula: \n\n?????? ???? = ??? \u00d7 (1 ? ???????? ?????? ?????) \n\n \n\nRevenue &amp; Cost \n\nIn May 2017, an investigation was organized to pursue bribery, corruption and money \n\nlaundering concerns. During the investigating period which will last for one year decreasing \n\nrevenue will be driven by the heightened result uncertainty of the investigation. In addition, \n\nsome of the big projects will finish in 2017, and Petrofac is looking for new orders, which are \n\ndriving the revenue and backlog in 2018. The Group Chief Executive, Ayman Asfari said in \n\nFull Year 2016 Earnings Presentation, there might be a decline in the revenue in the following \n\nyears, because there are low bidders on some projects (Petrofac, 2017). \n\nFor these reasons, the projected revenue will keep going down to around $5,500 million by \n\n2020. Because some projects will finish in the end of 2017, and if Petrofac cannot take more \n\nnew projects, there will be a steep fall in revenue in 2018. A considerable cost reduction in \n\n2016 is predicted to continue in the following years, because the engineering teams at Petrofac \n\nalways concentrate on finding the new way to cut cost and improve the cost effectiveness. \n\n$M 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Average \nRevenue 6,324 6,329 6,241 6,844 7,873  \n\nGrowth%  0.1% -1.4% 9.7% 15.0% 5.85% \n\n       \n\nProjection 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020  \nRevenue 7873 7412.43 6300.57 5,689.41 5688.84  \n\nGrowth%  -5.85% -15.0% -9.7% -0.1%  \n\nTable 35 Revenue Projection \n\n\n\nProjection   \n\n64 \n\n \n\nIt can be seen from the growth rate in the past 5 years that the trend is quite similar with our \n\nprojection for the next 5 years. Therefore, we assume the average growth rate 5.85% as the \n\ndecline rate for 2017, 15.0% for 2018, 9.7% for 2019 and 0.1% for 2020. \n\n \n\nCapital structure \n\nThe Petrofac\u2019s Debt to Capital ratio increased a lot during 2012-2015, then it started to be \n\nconstant around 0.68. Therefore, it can be assumed that no changes will be taken for the Capital \n\nStructure in the future. The future Debt-to-Capital Ratio is going to be 0.68 for the following 5 \n\nyears, which is in line with the ratio in 2015 and 2016. \n\nAccording to the Presentation of Ayman Asfari (2017), a global Cash Management Program is \n\nbeing completed with ongoing rephrasing of Capex in 2017, which helps to get strong cash \n\ngeneration, the amount of Debt will decrease in the following years to the lowest level. In the \n\nmeantime, there will be a rebound in Equity, it means the Debt amount will go down to around \n\n$700m and the equity will increase to 2012 levels by 2020, which is assumed to be $1,600m. \n\nAssuming that the straight-line method will be used to calculate the growth rate for Debt and \n\nEquity in the following years which will be -0.264 and 0.093. \n\n$ M 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 \nDebt 362.00 1361.00 2691.00 2660.00 2380.00 \n\ngrowth  0.778 0.494 -0.012 -0.118 \n\nEquity 1550.00 1992.00 1871.00 1232.00 1123.00 \n\n      \n\nProjection 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 \nDebt 2380.00 1752.70 1290.74 950.53 700.00 \n\ngrowth  -0.264 -0.264 -0.264 -0.264 \n\nEquity 1123.0 1226.9 1340.4 1464.5 1600.0 \n\ngrowth  0.093 0.093 0.093 0.093 \n\nTable 36 Debt Projection \n\n \n\nAssets Growth \n\nThe data shown in the Section 7.1 P/E Ratio &amp; Others presented that the Petrofac\u2019s total Assets \n\nand the growth rate started to decrease in 2014.

The discount rate used is 4.66%, based on the cost \n\nof equity given by CAPM in Section 4.3. The DDM assume the dividend growth rate of -1.28%, \n\nwhich is calculated from the 2012-2016 average in Section 8 (Dividend Growth) based on the \n\nlack of clear projects in the pipeline. According to the historical data, the Dividend per Share \n\nand the Shares Outstanding were always at the same level, therefore, $0.658 and 340 million \n\nwill be assumed as the DPS and the Number of Shares. \n\nThe Market Capitalization of $1,868.48 million taken from the London Stock Exchange (LSE) \n\nis lower than the self-calculated Equity Value of $3,897.68 million, so the Discounted Dividend \n\nModel presents Petrofac is undervalued. The self-calculate share price with $11.46 is higher \n\nthan the current price. All in all, a BUY signal is given as recommendation. \n\n \n\n9.2 Discounted Cash Flow Model \n\nUnder the discounted Cash Flow Model, the future free cash flow projection will be discounted \n\nback to present value by Cost of Equity (discount rate).

The conclusion from AE model is same as the result from DCF model is \n\nundervalued, as the self-calculated Equity Value ($2,337.28 million) to be higher than the \n\nMarket Capitalization ($1,868.48 million) estimated by LSE. The share price is projected to be \n\n$6.87 per share. All in all, a BUY recommendation is given by this model. \n\n  \n\n\n\nRecommendation   \n\n71 \n\n \n\nRecommendation \n\nInfluences from 2 sides for the valuation \n\n \n\nNegative Side \n\nSFO Investigation - Over the past few months, because the SFO started to investigate, the \n\nchief operating officer has been suspended and the share price has fallen by more than 50%. \n\nAccording to US broker Jefferies, the expectation of the fine might be around US$200 million. \n\nTherefore, suspending the dividend could be a rational way to repay this fine and the time \n\nneeded to rebuild their reputation must be considered. \n\n \n\nThe SFP Investigation is influencing the current share price of Petrofac. The price was falling \n\nsharply since the investigation was commenced by SFO. But investors have overacted that and \n\nsold-off their shares resulting in a further decline. \n\n \n\nPositive Side \n\nWeak Exchange Rate \u2013 there is a positive translational effect for UK listed companies because \n\nof the weak exchange rate, 1.2869$/\u00a3 in 15/08/2017 (taken from Bloomberg) which can be \n\ntraced back to Brexit. \n\n \n\nCyclical Recovery - As mentioned before, oil and gas service and equipment industry is a \n\ncyclical industry, which is same as the oil industry. After the long-time depression, long-\n\nawaited rebound is expected in oil industry. The investments from oil companies to Oil and Gas \n\nServices and Equipment industry is picking up, especially for Petrofac as the Petrofac (ROE \n\n0.09%) even has much higher return than Sector (ROE -15.10%). \n\n \n\nStrong Cash Generation \u2013 with the generating of Free Cash Flow of $500m in 2015 and \n\n$486m in 2016, the price for Petrofac looks cheap. 18% decline in Capex and 10% reduction \n\n\n\nRecommendation   \n\n72 \n\n \n\nin Net Debt driven by this strong cash generation. Which indicates that Petrofac is undervalued \n\nif the cash generation is sustainable. \n\n \n\nBoard Effectiveness \u2013 As analyzed in Section 1.3 Corporate Governance and Shareholders, \n\nPetrofac\u2019s board performs extremely well from 5 different respects. The strong and effective \n\nboard could help Petrofac to escape the terrible situation. \n\n \n\nIn the valuation section, DDM, DCF and AE model were used to value whether the company \n\nis overvalued or undervalued, which based on several assumptions of company\u2019s performance. \n\nHowever, the DDM is full of assumptions which regarding too many factors, and most of these \n\nfactors are beyond the control of investors as the limited information. Moreover, the key \n\nshortcoming of this model is DDM assumes there is a correlation between the dividend paid \n\nand the Revenue. Nevertheless, it can be seen from this project, Petrofac still tries to maintain \n\na stable dividend pay-out to satisfy their shareholders, even if their Net Income cannot cover \n\nthe distributions. Therefore, the Dividend Discount Model is not very useful in practice for \n\nnormal investors. The valuation from this model for Petrofac cannot be very accurate with a \n\nsignificant dividend paid-out ratio (22372%).  \n\n \n\nCompared to DDM, the Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity Model is more popular and \n\nsuitable. A BUY recommendation is given by this model as the company is undervalued. The \n\nAbnormal Earning Model proved this recommendation, and the projected share price given by \n\nDCF and AE are close to each other. This shows that in both models my recommendations hold. \n\n \n\nAll in all, the results from DCF and AE will be taken into the final recommendation, the target \n\nprice will be considered to be the average of the prices from DDM (\u00a35.63) and AE (\u00a35.37), \n\nwhich equals to \u00a35.50. \n\n \n\nKEY DATA \u00a3 Value \n\nCurrent Share Price (16/08/2017) 4.29 \n\n\n\nRecommendation   \n\n73 \n\n \n\nReport Share Price (30/12/2016) 8.71 \n\nShare Price DDM 8.97 \n\nShare Price DCF 5.63 \n\nShare Price AE 5.37 \n\nShares Outstanding 340 Million \n\nTable 41 Key Data \n\nFinal Recommendation \n\n \n\nBUY \u2013 given the undervalued conclusion of the share price from the DCF and AE model.
