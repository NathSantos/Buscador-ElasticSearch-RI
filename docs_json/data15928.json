Wild females were captured in deep-sea waters of southern Brazil\n(27\n\no \nS) and randomly divided in two groups: unilaterally eyestalk ablated and unablated (intact) females.\n\nA total of six eyestalk ablated and five unablated females were sampled after spawning in separated tanks.\nMorphological variables were recorded and ovaries were histologically evaluated according to oocyte\ntype and diameter. In the ovarian tissue of unablated females, basophilic oocytes (48.8 \u00b1 18.7 \u00b5m) were\ndominant (99.7 \u00b1 0.6%), with presence significantly lower in the ablated females (93.5 \u00b1 13.8%).\nLarger acidophilic oocytes (114.9 \u00b1 16.9 \u00b5m), with yolk granules in the cytoplasm, were detected only\nin the ovaries of ablated females. The significantly higher occurrence of atretic oocytes (4.8 \u00b1 10.3%) is\nanother distinguishable feature in the ovaries of ablated females compared with the unablated ones.\nThe presence of advanced yolky oocytes in ablated females just a few hours after spawning, may indi-\ncate the effect of eyestalk ablation on the precocious rematuration of the ovary. The higher number of\natretic oocytes in the ovary of ablated females could be relevant to their reproductive performance, as\nthey represent a percentage of oocytes that were not released in the spawning process. The present\nresults of the histology of the ovaries reveal the existence of substantial differences in the cell arrange-\nment of ablated and unablated females after spawning. The results also demonstrate the effects of\nunilateral eyestalk ablation in the reproductive cycle of F. paulensis under laboratory conditions.\nKey words: eyestalk ablation; gonad; histology; reproduction; Farfantepenaeus paulensis\n\nRESUMO\nO presente estudo avalia o efeito da abla\u00e7\u00e3o do ped\u00fanculo ocular na histologia gonadal de Farfantepenaeus\npaulensis ap\u00f3s a desova.

With\nthis technique, the endocrine system is directly af-\nfected by reducing the inhibitory control over repro-\nduction (DALL et al., 1990). Although faster matura-\ntion and a decrease in the latency period between\nspawnings are commonly observed, conflicting re-\nsults have been reported about the effect of the eye-\nstalk ablation on spawning quality (BEARD and\nWICKINS, 1980; EMMERSON, 1980; BROWDY and\nSAMOCHA, 1985; TAN-FERMIN, 1991). Histological\nanalysis in the ovaries of ablated and unablated fe-\nmales showed significant differences in the size and\ntype of oocytes (VOGT; QUINITIO; PASCUAL, 1989; TAN-\nFERMIN, 1991) as well as in the frequency of atretic\ncells (KELEMEC and SMITH, 1984), which have been\nassociated with reproductive performance.\n\nAlthough the ovarian histology of wild\nFarfantepenaeus paulensis has been described pre-\nviously (WORSMANN et al., 1971; WORSMANN and\nSESSO, 1977) and eyestalk ablation has been success-\nfully applied in broodstock from various sources\n(MARCHIORI and BOFF, 1983; MARCHIORI and CAVALLI,\n1993; CAVALLI; SCARDUA; WASIELESKY, 1997; PEIXOTO\net al., 2002), no information on ovarian histology of\neyestalk ablated females is currently available. In the\npresent study, we evaluated whether unilateral eye-\nstalk ablation affects the ovarian histological char-\nacteristics and oocyte type in recently spawned\nF. paulensis females.\n\nMaterial and Methods\n\nFemale sampling\n\nWild females of F. paulensis were captured in\ndeep-sea waters from southern Brazil (27o\n\n \nS) and\n\nmaintained in maturation tanks (5,000 L) under stan-\ndardized environmental conditions (CAVALLI;\nSCARDUA; WASIELESKY, 1997). After one week of ac-\n\nclimation, the animals were randomly isolated in two\ngroups: (1) unablated (intact) females and (2) unilat-\nerally ablated females by cutting and cauterizing eye-\nstalk. Maturation tanks were daily inspected and any\nfemale with ripe ovaries was transferred to separate\n200 L spawning tanks filled with 90 L of sea water.\nOnly completely spawned females were selected in\nthe next morning, otherwise they were returned to\nthe maturation tank. A total of five unablated and\nsix ablated females were sampled for histological ova-\nrian analysis. After the measurements of carapace\nlength (distance from the postorbital margin to the\nmid-dorsal posterior edge of the carapace, CL), body\nlength (distance between the tip of the rostrum and\ntip of the telson, BL).\n\nA comparative study of the ovarian histology of\neyestalk ablated and unablated F. paulensis and body\nwet weight (BW), the ovary was dissected and weighted\n(OW). The gonadosomatic index (GSI) was calculated\nas a percentage of the OW relative to the BW.\n\nOvarian histology and data analysis\n\nMiddle portions of the ovaries (2-3 mm) were\nfixed in Davidson solution for 24 h, embedded in\nparaffin, sectioned (6 mm) and stained with hema-\ntoxylin-eosin (BELL and LIGHTNER, 1988). Images of\nhistological sections (100x) were captured by video\nwith a camera (CSC-730, color NTSC) connected\nto a microscope (Nikon SC). Ten randomly digitized\nimages from different fields of each ovary were ana-\nlyzed using the software ImageTool version 2.0 for\nWindows (The University of Texas Health Science\nCenter in San Antonio, USA).\n\nThe oocytes were categorized according to the\nhistological features described by WORSMANN et al.\n(1971). The frequency of each oocyte type and de-\ngenerating oocyte (atresia) was taken as a percent-\nage of the total number of oocytes counted in each\nfield. The largest diameter of 30 oocytes or the total\nnumber available per category was measured in each\nimage. Only oocytes showing nuclei sectioned ap-\nproximately at the equatorial plane were measured.\n\n\n\n73\n\nA comparative study of the ovarian histology of eyestalk ablated and unablated  F. paulensis\n\nB. Inst. Pesca, S\u00e3o Paulo, 28(1): 71 - 76, 2002\n\nStudent t-test was used to detect differences, in\nthe analyzed characteristics, between unablated and\nablated females at the 5% significance level. Prior to\nthe analysis, percentage data (e.g. GSI and frequency\nof oocytes) were arcsine transformed, but only origi-\nnal values are presented.\n\nResults\n\nThere were no significant differences (P>0.05) in\nCL, BL, BW, OW or GSI between unablated and\nablated females (Table 1). However, histological\nanalysis of the ovaries revealed significant differences\n(P<0.05) in the frequency of oocytes and occurrence\nof atresia between the two groups (Table 2).\n\nIn the ovarian tissue of unablated females, baso-\nphilic oocytes (BO) represented nearly 100% of the\ncell population (Table 2; Figure 1A). These oocytes\nhad a nucleus larger than the cytoplasm size and sev-\n\neral nucleoli dispersed in the interior (Figure 1C).\nThe cell diameter ranged from 25 to 100 \u00b5m with\nsmaller oocytes lying in the center of the ovarian lobe.\nDespite the predominance of BO in the ovaries of\nablated females, their presence was significantly\nlower than among unablated spawners (Table 2).\n\nAcidophilic oocytes with yolk granules (YO) in\nthe cytoplasm were detected in the periphery of the\novarian lobe of ablated females (Figure 1B), but these\noocytes were not observed in the ovaries of unablated\nones. The nucleoli of the YO are organized on the\nperiphery of the nucleus. A considerable increase in\ncytoplasm is observed, with cell diameter ranging\nfrom 100 to 220 \u00b5m (Figure 1C).\n\nThe significantly high occurrence of atretic oo-\ncytes (AO) in the eyestalk ablated females is another\ndistinguishable feature in the cell arrangement of the\novaries of the females of the two groups (Figure 1B).\n\nTable 1.

Inst. Pesca, S\u00e3o Paulo, 28(1): 71 - 76, 200274\n\nDiscussion\n\nHistological techniques have been widely applied\nto describe the ovarian maturation process of sev-\neral penaeids (KI N G, 1948; T A N-F E R M I N  and\nPUDADERA, 1989; TAN-FERMIN, 1991; MEDINA et al.,\n1996; QUINTERO and GARCIA, 1998), including F.\npaulensis (WORSMANN et al., 1971; WORSMANN and\nSESSO, 1977). Despite some discrepancies on the\nnomenclature of the three basic oocyte types de-\nscribed in these studies, their results generally\nagree that basophilic oocytes are observed through-\nout ovarian development though they are predomi-\nnant in the immature and spent (after spawning)\n\nstages. Yolky acidophilic oocytes occur during\nintermediary development and acidophilic oo-\ncytes with cortical rods are only found in the\npre-spawning stage.\n\nIn our study, the presence of advanced yolky oo-\ncytes (YO) in the ovaries of ablated females just a\nfew hours after spawning may indicate a relatively\nfaster rate of ovarian maturation in these females.\nFurthermore, the frequency of BO was comparatively\nlower in the ovaries of ablated females, which is prob-\nably the result of the development of a certain num-\nber of BO into YO. In accordance, VOGT; QUINITIO;\nPASCUAL (1989) reported that an ablated Penaeus\nmonodon female exhibited oocytes in all stages of\n\nBO\n\nBO\nYOBO\n\nYO\nAO\n\nAO\n\nA B\n\nMn\n\nCt\n\nC D\n\nFigure 1.

Pesca, S\u00e3o Paulo, 28(1): 71 - 76, 2002\n\nmaturation 2h after spawning, while the unablated\nones contained only immature oocytes. These find-\nings were later confirmed by TAN-FERMIN (1991),\nw h o  a l s o  c o n c l u d e d  t h a t  t h e  p r e c o c i o u s\nrematuration of the ovary soon after spawning was\na direct result of eyestalk ablation.\n\nThe endocrinological processes controlling\ngonad maturation in penaeids is not yet fully\nunderstood, but eyestalk ablation presumably\naccelerates this process as it reduces the synthesis\nand release of the gonadal inhibitory hormone\n(GIH) from the neurosecretory complex located\nin the eyestalk (DALL et al., 1990; B R O W D Y ,\n1992). KULKARNI and NAGABHUSHANAM (1980) found\nthat during spawning eyestalk unablated\nParapenaeopsis hardwickii females had compara-\ntively higher GIH levels which could retard the next\ncycle of ovarian maturation. In contrast, the eyestalk\nablated ones were able to start a new maturation cycle\nimmediately as they had a lower concentration of GIH\nin the hemolymph. This hypothesis is in line with the\nhistological features of ovaries of eyestalk unablated\nand ablated F. paulensis observed in the present study.\n\nAtretic oocytes have been reported in various\nstages of reabsorption in the ovary of unablated\np e n a e i d s  a f t e r  s p a w n i n g  ( K I N G ,  1 9 4 8 ;\nMARTOSUBROTO, 1974; QUINTERO and GARCIA,\n1 9 9 8 ) ,  i n c l u d i n g  F.  p a u l e n s i s  s t u d i e d  b y\nWORSMANN et al. (1971). The reabsorption of ma-\nture oocytes in the ovary (atresia) could have a\nsignificant effect on the reproductive performance,\nas they represent oocytes that were not released in\nthe spawning process (KING, 1948). Nevertheless,\nthe effects of eyestalk ablation either on the inci-\ndence of atretic oocytes (TAN-FERMIN, 1991;\nK E L E M E C  and SM I T H , 1984, VO G T ; Q U I N I T I O ;\nPASCUAL, 1989) or on the number of eggs released\n(EMMERSON, 1980; BROWDY And SAMOCHA, 1985)\nare still conflicting. According to our results, the\nhigher frequency of atretic oocytes suggests that\neyestalk ablated F. paulensis females may have a\ndecrease in the number of eggs released per spawn-\ning. However, further studies correlating ovarian\n\nhistology and spawning events must be undertaken,\nin order to have conclusive results.\n\n The present results of the histology of the ova-\nries reveal the existence of substantial differences\nin the cell arrangement of eyestalk ablated and\nunablated females after spawning. The results also\nclearly demonstrate the effects of unilateral eyestalk\nablation in the reproductive cycle of F. paulensis\nunder laboratory conditions. Eyestalk ablation of\nF. paulensis females remains necessary in commer-\ncial hatcheries, aiming to produce large amounts\nof nauplii, due to the faster maturation and\nhigher spawning frequency (PE I X O T O et al.,\n1998). However, it might be advantageous to col-\nlect the first spawns of wild females as soon as\nthey are captured, since this probably maximize\nthe production cycle of the broodstock.\n\nReferences\n\nBEARD, T.A. and WICKINS, J.F.  1980  Breeding of Penaeus\nmonodon Fabricius in laboratory recirculation\nsystems.
