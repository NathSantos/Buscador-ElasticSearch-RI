The asphalt rubber \nbinder can be obtained through wet process in two different systems: terminal blending (produced at industrial plants) and \ncontinuous blending (produced in asphalt plants). This study presents a laboratory evaluation of asphalt rubber mixtures \nproduced with different asphalt rubber binders, using gap and dense gradations. The mechanical behavior of the mixtures \nstudied was established through several laboratory tests (stiffness, fatigue cracking and permanent deformation). A finite-\nelement methodology was also employed to evaluate the fatigue life in terms of reflective cracking. Moreover, the \nmorphologies of the crumb rubber and of the asphalt rubber binder were analyzed through scanning micrographs. The \nrheology of the asphalt rubber binder was characterized in order to predict the mechanical behavior of asphalt rubber \nmixtures. This study indicates that asphalt rubber mixtures improve the mechanical properties of asphalt pavements, \nenhancing their performance and increasing the service life of overlays in comparison to conventional mixtures. \n \n \nResumo \n \nAs misturas com asfalto-borracha constituem uma das mais promissoras t\u00e9cnicas utilizadas para aumentar vida de servi\u00e7o \ndos pavimentos asf\u00e1lticos reabilitados.

Introduction \n \n The disposal of scrap tires is a serious environmental problem all over the world. In order to minimize its impact, \ncrumb rubber from scrap tires have been used in the asphalt modification resulting the asphalt rubber binder, that have \ncontributed to enhance the structural and functional behavior of road pavements. \n\n\n\n20\u00b0 Encontro de Asfalto \n\n 2 \n\n The objective of this paper is to evaluate the laboratory performance of asphalt rubber mixtures, produced using \nthe wet process, in terms of fatigue life, permanent deformation and reflective cracking. Additionally, asphalt rubber binders \nwere analyzed in terms of rheology and morphology. \n Two gap-graded and two dense graded asphalt rubber mixtures were produced with different types of asphalt \nrubber binders (continuous blend and terminal blend). Continuous blend asphalt rubber binder was produced in laboratory \nwith conventional 35/50 pen asphalt and crumb rubber by the ambient and cryogenic processes. Terminal blend asphalt \nbinder was produced with 50/70 pen asphalt and crumb rubber by the ambient process, with two rubber percentages, 15% \nand 20%. A dense graded conventional mixture, produced with 50/70 pen asphalt, was used as control mixture. \n\n The mechanical tests comprised the following: dynamic modulus and fatigue tests using a four-point bending test; \npermanent deformation thought Repeated Simple Shear Test at Constant Height (RSST-CH). The reflective cracking \nresistance was studied through the methodology proposed by Minhoto et al. (2007, 2008), based on finite elements. \n \n2. Materials \n \n2.1. Aggregate and mixtures gradations  \n The dense graded asphalt rubber mixture was specified in accordance with type IV of the Asphalt Institute (AI) \nmix and prepared with asphalt rubber binder from continuous blending (35/50 pen asphalt and ambient crumb rubber) and \nterminal blend with 15% of rubber. The gap gradation used to produce the asphalt rubber mixtures followed the Caltrans \n(California Department of Transportation) specifications. The mixtures were prepared with asphalt rubber binder from \ncontinuous blending (35/50 pen asphalt and cryogenic crumb rubber) and terminal blend with 20% of rubber. The dense \ngradation used to prepare the control mixtures with conventional asphalt (50/70 pen) was the \u201cDNIT Grade C\u201d, specified by \nthe Brazilian Road Department. The sieve analyses followed the ASTM C 136 (1996) test method and the results are \npresented in Figure 1 and Table 1. \n \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n0,01 0,1 1 10 100\n\nSieves (mm)\n\n%\n p\n\nas\nsi\n\nng\n\nDNIT grade \"C\"\n\nCaltrans ARHM-GG\n\nAI type IV\n\n \nFigure 1.

Crumb rubber  \n Two crumb rubbers were used in this study. To produce continuous blending asphalt rubber binder, both cryogenic \nand ambient crumb rubber were introduced. To produce terminal blend asphalt rubber, only ambient crumb rubber was \nused. The crumb rubber was tested in accordance with the requirements of ASTM C 136, and the results are presented in \nFigure 2 with the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) limits. \n \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n0,01 0,1 1 10\nSieves (mm)\n\n%\n p\n\nas\nsi\n\nng\n\nADOT Specification\n\nAmbient crumb rubber\n\nCryogenic crumb rubber\n\n \n \n\nFigure 2. Crumb rubber gradations \n \n Identification of the morphology of the crumb rubbers was conducted using a Scanning Electron Microscope \n(SEM), LEICA Cambridge S 360. The images in Figure 3 (50x magnification) indicate that the morphology of the particles \nfrom ambient and cryogenic processes is completely different. \n The surface analysis of the crumb rubber obtained by the ambient process presents an irregular structure with \nseveral sizes and shapes, with rubber agglomerates, the smallest particles of which are adhered, having a spongy \nappearance. On the other hand, the surface of the cryogenic crumb rubber presents a flat texture with uniform and regular \ngrains. The specific surface was calculated with a proportion of 19,27 m2/kg for ambient crumb rubber and 13,61 m2/kg for \ncryogenic crumb rubber. \n \n\n    \n \n\nFigure 3. Morphology of the crumb rubbers \n \n \n2.3. Physical properties of asphalts \n Two conventional asphalts were tested in this study. The 50/70 pen (named as AB) was used to produce the control \nmixture and to produce the terminal blend asphalt rubber. The 35/50 pen asphalt (AP) was used to produce the continuous \nblending asphalt rubber binder. \n The terminal blend asphalt rubber were produced at an industrial plant, herein named as TB1 (20% of crumb \nrubber) and TB2 (15% of crumb rubber). The continuous blending asphalt rubber binders CB1 (with cryogenic rubber) and \nCB2 (with ambient rubber) were produced as follows: 17% of cryogenic crumb rubber; 90 minutes of digestion time; 180\u00baC \nof digestion temperature. \n The physical properties of the asphalts were evaluated in laboratory in terms of: softening point; penetration; \nresilience, apparent viscosity (Brookfield viscometer). The hardening of the asphalts due to oxidation was also tested \n\nAmbient Cryogenic \n\n\n\n20\u00b0 Encontro de Asfalto \n\n 4 \n\nthrough the Rolling Thin-Film Oven Test (RTFOT). The asphalt rubber binders tested followed the specifications of the \nASTM D 6114 (1997), type II. The test results are presented in Table 2. \n \n \n\nTable 2.

The \nasphalt rubber binders TB1 and TB2 seemed to be similar, except for the fact that TB1 presented higher viscosity (more \nrubber content) and that TB2 had more elasticity. The differences between CB1 and CB2 were more evident. CB1 had \nlower viscosity and a higher softening point. The low viscosity of the continuous blending in relation to terminal blending \ncan be explained by the fact that it was produced with more rigid asphalt than TB. Asphalt rubber binders CB (1 and 2) \npresented a high softening point than TB (1 and 2), what may indicate that mixtures produced with CB would be highly \nresistant to permanent deformation. In general, asphalt rubber binders are not very sensitive to hardening. \n \n \n2.4. Compatibility of asphalt rubber binder systems \n The compatibility of asphalt/polymer systems, such as asphalt rubber binder, may be defined in several ways \n(Brule, 1996). It may be in terms of the achievement of a particular morphology, i.e. the structural arrangement of the \npolymer (rubber) particles, chains or groups within the asphalt matrix. A reaction is claimed to occur when the asphalt and \nthe rubber particles interact. Observation suggests that particles seem gel-coated (Van Kirk et al., 1998). Compatible \nsystems usually have superior rheological characteristics, aging and stability properties than those of incompatible systems \nat the same polymer level (Holleran et al., 2001). \n Despite the fact that ambient crumb rubber, due to the greater surface area, can interact with asphalt more easily \nand quickly than cryogenic asphalt, the compatibility of the system still depends on the other parameters, such as the asphalt \nbase, the amount of the crumb rubber and the proportion of asphalt light fraction. \n The SEM analysis was used to evaluate the compatibility of the asphalt rubber binder system through the \ninteraction with the crumb rubber and the conventional asphalt after blending. Figures 4 and 5 illustrate the asphalt rubber \nbinder microstructures (100x magnification). In both, the systems showed to be compatible. \n \n \n\n\n\n20\u00b0 Encontro de Asfalto \n\n 5 \n\n \n\n      \nFigure 4. Microstructure of asphalts rubber binders CB1 and CB2 \n\n \n\n       \nFigure 5. Microstructure of asphalts rubber binders TB1 and TB2 \n\n \n The configuration used in this study to produce continuous blending asphalt rubber binder resulted in a good \ninteraction and, apparently, 35/50 pen asphalt reacted better with cryogenic than with ambient rubber (Figure 4). The \nterminal blend asphalt rubber system allows blending or combining asphalt and crumb rubber together to produce a long \nlasting product. Thus asphalt rubber binder produced through this system resulted in a compatible system and in a perfect \ninteraction between asphalt (50/70 pen) and ambient and cryogenic rubbers (Figure 5). \n \n \n2.5. Rheology of asphalts rubber binder \n Asphalt is a viscoelastic material, meaning that it simultaneously shows the behavior of an elastic material and that \nof a viscous material. The relationship between these two properties is used to measure the capability of the binder to resist \npermanent deformation and fatigue cracking. A binder needs to be stiff and elastic to resist permanent deformation; to resist \nfatigue cracking, the binder needs to be flexible and elastic (FHWA, 1994). \n The rheology tests with rheometers are used to characterize the viscous and elastic behavior of the asphalt. It is \naccomplished by measuring the viscous and elastic properties of a thin asphalt sample, between an oscillating and a fixed \nplate. As the force (shear stress) is applied to the asphalt by the spindle, the rheometer measures the response (shear strain) \nof the asphalt to the force. If the material was perfectly elastic, the response would coincide immediately with the applied \nforce, and the time lag between the two would be zero. A perfectly viscous material would have a larger time lag between \nload and response. \n The relationship between the applied stress and the resulting strain quantifies both types of performance, and \nprovides the necessary information to calculate two important asphalt binder properties: the complex shear modulus (G*) \nand the phase angle (?). The complex shear modulus, G*, represents the total deformation resistance when loaded or \nsheared and it is defined as the ratio of maximum shear stress (?max) to maximum shear strain (?max), expressed as follows: \n \n\n \nmax\n\nmax*\n?\n?\n\n=G            (1) \n \n The phase angle, ?, represents the relative distribution between the elastic response and the viscous response to \nloading. It indicates the delayed strain response, or lag, of the binder to the applied shear stress, during steady state \n\nCB1 CB2 \n\nTB1 TB2 \n\n\n\n20\u00b0 Encontro de Asfalto \n\n 6 \n\nconditions (Roberts et al., 1996). For a perfectly elastic material, ? is zero, and the whole deformation is temporary, \nwhereas for a viscous material, ? approaches 90\u00ba, and the deformation is permanent. \n The Superpave specifications define the rutting factor, G*/sin ?, that represents the maximum temperature that a \nbinder can reach without permanent deformation. The fatigue cracking factor is G*.sin ?.  \n In this study, the rheological characterization of asphalt rubber binders was performed to estimate the mechanical \nbehavior of the material. The rheological data were collected using a parallel plate rheometer (Rheological StressTech HR) \n(sample with a diameter of 40 mm and a thickness of 0,8 mm) which was capable of measuring the complex shear modulus \nand the phase angle for different stresses and strain rates (Figure 6). \n In relation to the asphalt rubber binder obtained by the continuous blending (CB) and through the terminal blend \nprocesses (TB), the tests were conducted at 20\u00baC (intermediate service temperature) and 60\u00baC (high service temperature) \nwith frequencies between 1 to 10 Hz. Figures 7 and 8 present the G*/sin?, at 60\u00baC and G*.sin? , at 20\u00baC. The phase angle is \npresented in Figure 9. \n \n\n     \n \n\nFigure 6.

Asphalts rubber binder phase angles \n\n \n The results of the rheology tests are an indicator of the properties of the asphalt rubber binder and can be used to \npredict the mixture performance. The results obtained allow concluding that, at high temperatures, the asphalt rubber binder \nCB1 and CB2 should acquire higher resistance to permanent deformation than TB1 and TB2, due to higher values of G* \nand lower values of ?. Furthermore, for intermediate temperatures, CB1 and CBs also present the properties of a soft elastic \nmaterial (lesser G*.sin? and lower ?), that probability would improve the fatigue properties. \n The complex modulus of asphalt, at many levels of temperature and load time-rate, can be determined by a master \ncurve constructed at a reference temperature (20\u00baC). Master curves are constructed using the principle of time-temperature \nsuperposition. \n To construct the master curves of asphalt rubber binder, obtained by graphic translation of the isotherms aligning \nfrequencies of same value, the rheology tests were conducted under five temperatures (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC and 60\u00baC) \nwith applied frequencies between 0,0001 to 100 Hz. The master curves, at a reference temperature of 20\u00baC, are presented in \nFigure 10. The results show that CB1 and CB2 are more elastic than TB1 and TB2, what can be verified by the slope of the \ncurves (a horizontal curve represents a purely elastic behavior). TB1 would be more susceptible to temperature variations. \n \n\n\n\n20\u00b0 Encontro de Asfalto \n\n 8 \n\n \n\n1E+03\n\n1E+04\n\n1E+05\n\n1E+06\n\n0,0001 0,001 0,01 0,1 1 10 100\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nG\n* \n\n(P\na)\n\nTB2\n\nCB1\n\nCB2\n\nTB1\n\n \n \n\nFigure 10.

A \nconventional dense graded mixture was produced with conventional asphalt 50/70 pen, as the control mixture. These \nmixtures were produced as follows:  \n\u2013 MCB1 \u2013 gap graded asphalt rubber mixture; Caltrans ARHM-GG gradation; 8,0% of asphalt content (continuous \nblending asphalt rubber binder, produced in laboratory, asphalt base 35/50 pen, 17% of cryogenic rubber content, 180\u00baC \ndigestion temperature; reaction time of 90 minutes), and 6,0% of void content; \n\u2013 MCB2 \u2013 dense graded asphalt rubber mixture; AI mix type IV gradation; 7,0% of asphalt content (continuous blending \nasphalt rubber binder, produced in laboratory, asphalt base 35/50 pen, 17% of ambient rubber content, 180\u00baC digestion \ntemperature; reaction time of 90 minutes) and 5,0% of void content; \n\u2013 MTB1 \u2013 gap graded asphalt rubber mixture, Caltrans ARHM-GG gradation; 8,5% of asphalt content (terminal blend \nasphalt rubber, produced at industrial plant, asphalt base 50/70 pen, 20% of ambient rubber content) and 6,0% of void \ncontent; \n\u2013 MTB2 \u2013 dense graded asphalt rubber mixture, AI mix type IV gradation; 7,0% of asphalt content (terminal blend asphalt \nrubber, asphalt base 50/70 pen, produced at industrial plant, 15% of ambient rubber content) and 5,0% of void content; \n\u2013 MCO \u2013 dense graded conventional mixture, DNIT Grade \u201cC\u201d gradation; 5,5% of asphalt content (50/70 pen) and 4,0% of \nvoid content. \n Table 3 presents a summary of the studied mixtures, in which the aggregate gradation, binder content, binder type \nand void content can be observed. \n The mixtures were compacted with a steel roller in a mould (75x49x8 cm3). The compacted slabs were sawed and \ncored with the appropriate dimension for each type of test. \n \n\nTable 3.

Mechanical tests \n \n3.1. Dynamic modulus and fatigue life \n Four point bending tests were conducted to evaluate the dynamic modulus and fatigue life. Beam specimens of 38 \ncm long by 5 cm thick by 6,3 cm wide were used in frequency sweep test to measure the dynamic modulus and the phase \nangle when subjected to seven loading frequencies (10; 5; 2; 1; 0,5; 0,2; 0,1 Hz), at 20\u00baC.  \n Fatigue tests were conducted according to the AASHTO TP8/94, at 20\u00baC and at 10 Hz. Fatigue failure was \nassumed to occur when the dynamic modulus was reduced to 50 percent of the initial value. The tests were conducted at \nthree strain levels of approximately 200, 400 and 800 microstrains, with three repetitions for each level. The test results \nconsidered bottom-up cracking to determine an empirical fatigue relationship of the simple power formula (Monismith et \nal., 1971) shown as: \n \n\n \n\nb\n\naN ??\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n=\n\n?\n1\n\n           (2) \n \nwhere: N = number of repetitions until failure; ? = tensile strain applied (10-6); a and b = experimentally determined \ncoefficients. \n \n The dynamic modulus of the mixtures for all the frequencies applied is shown in Figure 11 and the phase angle of \nthe mixtures is depicted in Figure 12. \n The results in Figure 11 show that the MCB2 has a higher dynamic modulus than the other mixtures, and at 10 Hz, \nthis value is similar to MCO. It is noticed that the terminal blend mixtures (MTB1 and MTB2) presented lower dynamic \nmodulus than the continuous blend mixtures. In Figure 12, the results of the phase angle, an indicator of viscoelastic \nproperties of the mixtures, indicate that MCO is more viscous than asphalt rubber mixtures (continuous blend and terminal \nblend) what represents an improvement in the elastic response and, therefore, a better fatigue performance of the asphalt \nrubber mixtures. \n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\n6000\n\n7000\n\n0,1 1 10\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nD\nyn\n\nam\nic\n\n M\nod\n\nul\nus\n\n (M\nP\n\na)\n\nMCO MTB1\nMCB1 MTB2\nMCB2\n\n \n \n\nFigure 11.

The terminal blend mixtures presented higher fatigue life than the continuous blend mixtures. \nHowever, it is important to consider that MTB1 has more asphalt content (8,5%) than MBC1 (8,0%). For terminal blend \nmixtures, it was also observed that the use of dense gradation (MTB2, 7,0% of asphalt content) improved the fatigue \nperformance of the mixture better than the gap gradation (MTB1, 8,5% of asphalt content). The same occurred with \ncontinuous blend mixtures, in which the MCB2 (7,0% of asphalt content) presented a more extended fatigue life than \nMCB1 (8,0% of asphalt content). It was observed that lower air void contents improved the fatigue performance of all \nasphalt rubber mixtures. \n\n\n\n20\u00b0 Encontro de Asfalto \n\n 11 \n\n \n\n100\n\n1000\n\n1E+03 1E+04 1E+05 1E+06 1E+07 1E+08\nNumber of cycles\n\nSt\nra\n\nin\n (1\n\n0-\n6 )\n\nMTB1\nMCB1\nMCO \nMCB2\nMTB2\n\n \n \n\nFigure 13.

Permanent deformation \n Cylindrical specimens with 5 cm thick and 15 cm diameter were used for permanent deformation tests through a \nRepeated Simple Shear Test at Constant Height (RSST CH) that consists of applying a repeated shear stress to a cylindrical \nspecimen, while measuring the resulting plastic shear strains, at a given controlled temperature. During the test there is no \nchange in volume (the height of the specimen is maintained constant). The applied load has a duration of 0,1 seconds, with \nan unload time of 0,6 seconds. A vertical load is applied to the sample during the test to ensure a constant height. The test \nprocedure followed the AASHTO TP7-01, Test Procedure C. The shear stress is applied to the sample until the sample \nreaches 5% permanent shear strain. The RSCH-CH test is carried out until the specimens reach the maximum plastic shear \nstrain of 0,04545, which is equivalent to the limit value of 12,7 mm rut depth (Sousa et al., 1994), expressed in Equation 3. \nIn this study, the asphalt rubber specimens were tested at 60\u00baC.

Permanent deformation test results \n \n\n The permanent deformation results (Figure 15) give evidence that the asphalt rubber mixtures are more resistant \nthan the conventional mixture. MCB1 showed a better performance than the other mixtures. The resistance to permanent \ndeformation of MCB1 is justified by the greater softening point and large elastic recovery presented by the CB1 asphalt \nrubber binder. The gap graded gradation in continuous blending mixtures promoted an enhanced resistance to permanent \ndeformation, associated with an excellent interaction between cryogenic rubber and 35/50 pen to resist rutting. In the case \nof the terminal blend mixtures, MTB2, with less asphalt and voids content and dense gradation, it performed better than \nMTB1. \n The rheology results, in terms of G*/sin?,  were confirmed by the permanent deformation tests once the greater \nG*/sin?,  the greater the resistance to permanent deformation, as it can be observed in Figure 16. \n \n\n MCB1\n\nMTB2 \n\n MCB2 \n\n MTB1\n\nMCO\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\n100000\n\n120000\n\n1E+05 1E+06 1E+07\n\nESAL (80 kN)\n\nG\n*/\n\nse\nn\n\n?\n\n \n \n\nFigure 16.

(2007, 2008), based on finite elements, which takes into account the influence of temperature variation in the \nreflective cracking of asphalt pavements. \n The numeric simulation used to predict the reflective cracking was accomplished by using the finite element \nprogram ANSYS, which allows evaluating the damage of a pavement overlay due to the effect of traffic and temperature \nvariations. The temperature variations considered the temperatures verified in a sub-tropical climate (South of Brazil) and \nair temperature collected for 30 years in Florian\u00f3polis, Brazil. \n\n\n\n20\u00b0 Encontro de Asfalto \n\n 13 \n\n The geometry adopted to evaluate the resistance to reflective cracking was based on a pavement with the following \ncharacteristics: (i) overlay = 0,12 m; (ii) existent cracked layer = 0,21 m; (iii) unbound layer = 0,20 m. \n The application of the finite element model reproduced the pavement damage for the period of one year, as \npresented in Figure 17, in which the pavement life is also depicted. \n \n\n1E-03\n\n1E-02\n\n1E-01\n\nMTB2 MTB1 MCB2 MCB1 MCO \n\nA\nnn\n\nua\nl d\n\nam\nag\n\ne\n\n  \n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\nMTB2 MTB1 MCB2 MCB1 MCO \n\nL\nif\n\ne \n(y\n\nea\nrs\n\n)\n\n \n \n\nFigure 17. Annual damage and reflective cracking life of the mixtures \n \n The results obtained through the numeric simulation showed a great difference between the asphalt rubber mixtures \nand conventional ones. Furthermore, extremely high life values for the modified mixtures were assessed. This can be \nexplained by the weak performance obtained by MCO in fatigue tests in comparison to asphalt rubber mixtures. \n \n \n4. Conclusions \n \n The primary aim of this work was to evaluate the mechanical properties of asphalt rubber mixtures when compared \nto conventional ones. The mechanical tests included dynamic modulus, fatigue cracking and permanent deformation. The \nmethodology developed by Minhoto et al. (2007, 2008), which assessed reflective cracking in pavement overlays through \nFEM analysis, was applied to evaluate the resistance to reflective cracking of asphalt rubber mixtures. \n From the SEM analysis it can be observed that cryogenic and ambient crumb rubbers have different morphologies. \nWhile cryogenic has an angular smooth and cracked appearance surface, ambient has a porous surface. The SEM \nmorphology of asphalts rubber binder systems also showed that all binders result in compatible systems. These analyses are \nsignificant and helpful to make a decision when evaluating the digestion time requested to produce asphalt rubber binders. \n Asphalt rubber binders were characterized rheologically to estimate the mechanical behavior of the material, \nfollowing the SUPERPAVE parameters G*.sin? and G*/sin?, which are good indicators of fatigue performance and \nresistance to permanent deformation. However, the mixture variables such as asphalt and void content and type of gradation \nalso need to be considered in the prediction. \n The continuous blend mixtures presented higher dynamic modulus than terminal blend. The MCB2 presented a \nhigher dynamic modulus and, at 10 Hz, the value was similar to that of conventional mixtures. The results of the phase \nangle indicated that the conventional mixture is more viscous than asphalt rubber mixtures independently of the process \nused, what represents an improvement in its elastic response and, consequently, a better fatigue performance. \n Fatigue tests showed that asphalt rubber mixtures exhibit significantly more fatigue performance than conventional \nmixtures. Terminal blend mixtures presented a higher fatigue life than continuous blend mixtures. \n The results of permanent deformation tests demonstrated that asphalt rubber mixtures were more resistant to the \ndevelopment of plastic shear strains than the conventional mixture. Although similar, the MCB1 presented a better \nperformance, followed by the MTB2. This behavior was also predicted through rheology tests. \n The FEM method used to simulate reflective cracking was a valuable tool to evaluate the performance of asphalt \noverlays under traffic and thermal loading conditions. The results of the FEM method showed that the mixture MCB \npresented a more extended fatigue life in relation to reflective cracking than the others. \n The most important conclusion drawn from this study states that asphalt rubber mixtures present better mechanical \nproperties and a superior performance than conventional mixtures, what allows asphalt pavement layers have a more \nextended life cycle. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n20\u00b0 Encontro de Asfalto \n\n 14 \n\n \n5.
