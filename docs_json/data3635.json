This combination is of great interest, not only from the fundamental point of view, but also because it allows the production of novel functional and hierarchically structured hybrid materials. Two families of materials were obtained, featuring two different types of cross links: urea and urethane. The influence of parameters such as the alkyl and alkylene chain length and the solvent on the nanostructure was analyzed.\nIn the second part of the work the sol-gel method was used to prepare organic-inorganic hybrid electrolytes composed of novel di-urethane cross-linked poly(s-caprolactone)/siloxane biohybrids incorporating a wide range of potassium triflate concentration in one example and a mixture of lithium triflate and europium triflate in the other example. In both cases prototype ECDs have been constructed using a four layer-sandwich configuration comprising two outermost layers composed of transparent conducting oxide (TCO) films, an EC film of tungsten oxide (WO3) and an IC active layer of selected ormolyte samples. The average optical transmittance, colour contrast, optical density and device response time associated with the colouring/bleaching processes have been determined. The colour change has been quantified in the prototype based on the Li/Eu mixture.\nCalcium carbonate (CaCO3) is an important biomineral in Nature, that can exist in six different polymorphic forms. Among them, the metastable amorphous CaCO3 phase (ACC) is used in many organisms as a transient intermediate to form single crystals of calcite and aragonite with elaborate shapes. ACC has a tremendous potential in the orthopedic field. Herein we have employed poly(vinylpyrrolidone) to retard the crystallization of ACC. In addition, several ionic liquids and surfactants were employed to tune the morphology of calcite.\nResumo\nEsta tese centra-se na prepara\u00e7\u00e3o de sistemas h\u00edbridos org\u00e2nicos-inorg\u00e2nicos com propriedades espec\u00edficas.\nNa primeira parte do trabalho utilizaram-se o processo sol-gel e metodologias de auto-organiza\u00e7\u00e3o na prepara\u00e7\u00e3o de materiais h\u00edbridos org\u00e2nicos-inorg\u00e2nicos.

Obtiveram-se duas fam\u00edlias distintas de amostras, cuja principal diferen\u00e7a reside na natureza do n\u00f3 de liga\u00e7\u00e3o entre os componentes org\u00e2nico e inorg\u00e2nico: grupo ureia e grupo uretano. A influ\u00eancia exercida na estrutura\u00e7\u00e3o dos materiais por par\u00e2metros, tais como o comprimento da cadeia de tipo alquilo (pendente ou em ponte) e o tipo de solvente, foi analisada.\nNa segunda parte do trabalho o m\u00e9todo sol-gel foi usado na prepara\u00e7\u00e3o de electr\u00f3litos h\u00edbridos org\u00e2nicos-inorg\u00e2nicos inovadores. Foi preparada uma matriz bioh\u00edbrida de poly(s-caprolactona)/siloxano, baseada em n\u00f3s de liga\u00e7\u00e3o de uretano. A matrizfoi dopada com uma gama de concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de triflato de pot\u00e1ssio muito ampla, num caso, e com misturas de triflato de l\u00edtio/triflato de eur\u00f3pio no segundo caso. Para ambos sistemas foram constru\u00eddos prot\u00f3tipos de dispositivos electrocr\u00f3micos. Estes foram constru\u00eddos usando-se uma configura\u00e7\u00e3o de tipo \"sandwish\" de quatro camadas, envolvendo duas camadas de filme de \u00f3xido condutor transparente, um filme de \u00f3xido de tungst\u00e9nio (WO3) e uma camada activa condutora i\u00f3nica de um ormolito de composi\u00e7\u00e3o optimizada. A transmit\u00e2ncia \u00f3ptica, o contraste de cor, a densidade \u00f3ptica, e o tempo de resposta do dispositivo associado ao processo de colora\u00e7\u00e3o/descolora\u00e7\u00e3o foram determinados. A varia\u00e7\u00e3o de cor foi quantificada para o prot\u00f3tipo cujo ormolito cont\u00e9m uma mistura de triflato de l\u00edtio/triflato de eur\u00f3pio,\nO carbonato de c\u00e1lcio (CaCO3) \u00e9 um dos biominerais mais importantes na Natureza.

Uma das potenciais aplica\u00e7\u00f5es do CCA encontra-se no dom\u00ednio da ortopedia.. Neste trabalho utilizou-se a poli(vinilpirrolidona) para retardar a cristaliza\u00e7\u00e3o do CCA. Foram ainda usados diferentes l\u00edquidos i\u00f3nicos e tensioactivos para controlar a morfologia de calcite.\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9\nCette these d\u00e9crit la pr\u00e9paration de mat\u00e9riaux hybrides organiques-inorganiques aux propri\u00e9t\u00e9s cibl\u00e9es.\nDans la premiere partie de ce travail, le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 sol-gel a \u00e9t\u00e9 coupl\u00e9 aux techniques d'auto-assemblage pour la pr\u00e9paration de mat\u00e9riaux hybrides organiques-inorganiques.

Chemical reactions allow producing new materials that are characterized by physical techniques. The inspiration from Nature is a constant [1-3]. Many ideas come from Nature giving origin to bio-inspired materials, also designated by biomimetic materials. Diatoms [4] and radiolariae [5], bones and crustacean carapaces [6], mollusk shells or nacre (also called mother of pearl) and wood are just a few examples of naturally occurring materials, inspiring materials' scientists.\nNatural materials can serve as models to inspire and develop new concepts and new biomimetic approaches [2, 3]. The most famous example of biomimetic material is probably Velcro, the trend mark of a hook-and-loop fastener discovered in the 1940s by a Swiss Engineer. Other examples come from the lotus leaf and the gecko foot: their structures have provided inspiration for advanced functional materials such as superhydrophobic and superadhesives surfaces [7, and references therein].\nMaterials from Nature present a high degree of sophistication, miniaturization (i.e., they accommodate a maximum of elementary functions in a small volume) finding a compromise between different properties or functions [2]. They exhibit complexity and hierarchical structure from the nanometer, to the micrometer and millimeter scales. The properties of many materials are dependent on the scale [2] and on the form [8, 9]. The existence of a high degree of order across multiple length scales is of great importance since it can dictate the final application of the materials. Consequently, one of the major goals of materials science is to produce hierarchically structured materials that are ordered over all length scales. Nanostructured matter has become popular among industrials and academics. Nanomaterials characteristically exhibit physical and chemical properties different from the bulk as a consequence of having at least on spatial dimension in the size range of 1-1000 nm. Globally speaking, nanoscience and nanotechnology concern making, imaging, manipulating and using\nreally small things [10]. In the last decades Feynman's nanoworld (\u201con the head of a pin\u201d) has not ceased to inspire the scientific community. Nanoscale objects are crucial as components in the emergence of cellular life [11] and also as small-scale materials with advanced functions and properties that can be applied in numerous applications. Interestingly, science and art share in common the notion of form. Architecture is related with the bottom-up approach and sculpture is associated with the top-down approach. Nanomaterials fabrication usually applies bottom-up and top-down approaches [8, 12]. In architecture the building blocks (BBs) are integrated into a spatial structure [8] in order to build a new monument with specific shape, dimension and functionality. The bottom-up strategy employs chemical processes such as sol-gel, chemical vapour deposition (CVD), template synthesis or spray pyrolysis in the construction and growth through the use of precursors of organized materials from the nanometric level. In contrast, in sculpture the form is the result of the exclusion of matter(e.g., stone and wood). In the same way, top-down approaches essentially consist in the controlled nanostructuring of a bulk material by breaking it into smaller pieces or patterning it using diverse physical and/chemical tools. Top-down approaches are extensively employed in a wide range of well-known techniques such as photolithography, soft lithography, nanografting, electron beam lithography and focused ion beam lithography. In Figure 1.1 are indicated some representative keywords related with the main concepts behind this these: biomaterial (a), lotus leave showing an hydrophobic effect (b), botton up (c) ans top down (d) approaches.\nFigure 1.1. Representative examples of the keywords related with the main concepts discussed in thesis: a silica microskeleton a biomaterial, with a hierarchical structure (reproduced from reference [12] (a); a lotus leave displaying an hydrophobic effect (reproduced from reference [13]) (b) Bottom up represented by the architecture of a building (c) and Top-down represented by sculpture (d).\nOrganic-inorganic hybrid materials\nIn the last years a significant number of relevant books [14, 15] and reviews and/or feature articles [16-18] dealing with hybrid materials have appeared in the literature. The scope of such works spans from the strategies of synthesis, to the properties and applications [19-22], including biohybrids and related materials [1, 4].\nBy definition a hybrid material includes two moieties blended in the molecular scale. They can be defined as nanocomposites at the molecular scale, having at least one component (either organic or biological) with a characteristic length scale on the nanometer size [14, 23, 24].\nThe properties of the resulting materials are defined by the corresponding hybrid interface [14, 16]. The concept of organic-inorganic hybrids started to be used in the 1980s with the expansion of the soft inorganic chemistry, i.e. Chimie Douce, in which mild synthetic conditions open a versatile access to chemically designed organic-inorganic hybrid materials. Their potential applications have increased with the continuous development of novel physico-chemical characterization methods.\nThe organic-inorganic hybrids may be classified into two main classes, on the basis of the possible interactions connecting the inorganic and organic species.\nIn Class I organic-inorganic hybrids the organic-inorganic components additively exchange weak bonds (hydrogen, Van der Waals or ionic bonds). They may result from [14, 18] :\n(a)\tOrganic dyes embedded in sol-gel matrices\n(b)\tOrganic monomers embedded in sol-gel matrices\n(c)\tInorganic polymers embedded in a polymer\nOne of the most popular examples of a class I hybridmaterial is the Maya blue (Figure 1.2). It is a very old and remarkable man-made hybrid material processed via soft chemical conditions [18]. Maya blue is a robust pigment, not only resisting biodegradation, but showing also unprecedented stability when exposed to acids, alkalis and organic solvents. In Maya blue molecules of the natural indigo are encapsulated within the channels of a clay mineral known as palygorskite. This material combines the color of the organic pigment and the resistance of the inorganic host, a synergic material with properties and performance well beyond those a simple mixture of components [18].\nFigure 1.2. Computer enhanced Mayan Warrior from Bonampak -Mexico (reproduced from\nreference [18]).\nIn Class II organic-inorganic hybrids the two phases are totally or partly linked together through strong chemical bonds characterized by strong orbital overlap (covalent or iono-covalent bonds). The molecules used as starting building blocks for Class II hybrids possess at least two distinct functionalities: (1) Chloro- or alkoxy groups (M-OR bonds, where M represent metal) which can experience hydrolysiscondensation reactions in the presence of water and lead to an oxopolymer framework; (2) Metal-to-carbon (M-C) links which are hydrolytically stable. The nature of the stable M-C link depends on the nature of the metallic centre. Whereas the Si-C bond is inert towards hydrolysis, other M-C bonds are easily cleaved in the presence of water (e.g., M = Ti, Zr) [25, 26]. The existence of covalent chemical linkages between organic and mineral components present numerous advantages: (a) The potential to synthesize entirely new materials from functionalized alkoxides; (b) Minimization of phase separation; (c) Better definition of the organic-inorganic interface [24].\nMany hybrid materials display both types of interactions and have the possibility to be classified either as Class I or Class II hybrids [24].\nStrategies to produce organic-inorganic hybrids\nGeneral bottom-up strategies for the synthesis of sol-gel derived hybrid materials have been extensively discussed in several reviews [14, 16-18, 24]. These strategies are commonly designated by route A, route B and route C (Figure 1.3). In some cases a route D is also referred [16] (Figure 1.3).\nMonomen\nPolymen\nSelf-Assembly\nF Organic Connecton\nStrategies from well-defined \"Nano-Objects1\nIntercalation Chemistry\nTemplated-based Strategies\nNanoparticles, POSS-\nDispersion-Assembly Nanobuilding Blocks (NBBs)\nFunctional Coatings\nEnergy\nBiomaterials B ioapplications\nMicro-optics Micro- electronics\nIntegrative Approaches &amp; Materials Processing\nConventional Sol-Gel Route\nMXnfmetallic salts) Multifunctional ligands\nMORft ,\t_________ .\nOR).Si*>-\u00bbSiOR.

Several strategies to produce organic-inorganic hybrids (reproduced from reference [17]).\nRoute A gathers the soft chemistry-based approaches including not only the conventional sol-gel chemistry from specific bridged and polyfunctional precursors, but also the hydrothermal processes [16].\nAmorphous hybrid networks are obtained via conventional sol-gel pathways through hydrolysis-condensation of various metal species (alkoxydes /halide derivatives) which can be organically modified [16]. These strategies are simple, low cost and yield amorphous nanocomposite hybrid materials, easily shaped as films or bulks [17]. The materials are often polydisperse in size and locally heterogeneous in chemical composition.\nA special group of materials obtained by this synthetic route are the bridged silsesquioxanes (BSs) [27, 28]. They are obtained from bridged organosilane precursors, represented by the notation X3-Si-R'-Si-X3, R' being an organic spacer and X = Cl, Br or OR. Upon chemically tailoring the bridge, materials with a high degree of organization where obtained, thanks to strong interactions between the organic fragments. Moreau et al. introduced for the first time a hybrid silica system with a\nlamellar structure using self-assembly routes based on the strong hydrogen bonding association ability of the urea groups and van der Waals interactions taking place between the central alkylene chains [29-33]. In some recent works, these urea- BSs have been doped with europium ions, making them very promising materials field for the domain of optics [34, 35]. The study of these nanostructured silsesquioxanes will be the subject of an important part of the present thesis.\nThe last part of route A involves the hydrothermal synthesis of Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) [36]. MOFs constitute a very interesting class of hybrid materials with a high and tunable porosity, and a crystalline architecture. Applications of these materials [37] in the fields of gas sorption [38], separation or purification, luminescence [39], catalysis or nanomedicine [40] are being developed.\nRoute B corresponds to the assembling or dispersion of well-defined nanobuilding blocks (NBBs) [16]. These consist of perfectly calibrated preformed objects that keep their integrity in the final material, which means that the structural units that are present as sources for material formation can also be found in the final material. Examples of materials obtained with this technique are: clusters [41], organically pre- or post-functionalized nanoparticles, nano-core shells or layered compounds able to intercalate organic compounds[18]. These materials have commercial applications, such as nanofillers in the Green Tyres developed by Michelin through a collaboration with Rhodia [18]. The rolling bands are constituted by elastomers containing nanosilica particles fillers.\nRoute C corresponds to the well known self-assembly process [16]. Typically, selfassembled systems exhibit hierarchical structure and exhibit emergent properties. In practice, self-assembly may be carried out in the presence or absence of a structure directing agent (i.e., template), i.e., through template-directed self-assembly or selfdirected assembly, respectively. This particular issue will be discussed in further detail below. In the context of route C it consists in the organization or the texturation of growing inorganic or hybrid networks through the use of an external templates, such as micelles. These inorganic or hybrid phases can be generated from precursors previously described in route A or B [24], allowing a high control and tuning of the hybrids interfaces, and leads to a whole continuous range of nanocomposites, from\nIn some reviews a route D is also mentioned [18, 24].\nRoute D corresponds to the so-called integrative synthesis [16]. The strategies reported above mainly offer the controlled design and assembling of hybrid materials in the 1 to 500 A range. Micromolding methods have been developed, in which the use of controlled phase separation phenomena, emulsion droplets, latex beads, bacterial threads, colloidal templates or organogelators enable controlling the shapes of complex objects at the microscale [16, 18]. This strategy, when combined with routes A, B and C, allows the construction of hierarchically organized materials in terms of construction and functions.\nSol-gel process\nThe sol-gel process has been extensively employed and studied [42-45]. This process was developed in the 1930s using silicon alcoxides as precursors from which silica was produced. The reference book in this area [44] will be used as follows to describe the basic principles behind the method.\nThis chemistry is based on inorganic polymerization reactions in a solvent. The silicon based sol-gel process is probably the one that has been most investigated and is the base of this work: therefore the fundamental reaction principles are discussed using this process as a model system.\nTwo main reactions are involved in this process, namely hydrolysis and condensation.\nIn a hydrolysis reaction, an alcoxy group (-OR) is substituted by a hydroxyl group (-OH) at the silicon atom, with the concomitant formation of an alcohol (ROH):\nSi(OR)4 + H2O^ HO-Si(OR)3 + ROH\t(a)\nAccording to the amount of water employed and the presence of catalyst the species can be partially hydrolyzed (as stated before) or totally hydrolyzed:\nSi(OR)4 +4 H2O^ Si(OR) 4 + 4 ROH\t(b)\nIn the condensation reactions two partially hydrolyzed species (or one partially hydrolyzed and other not reacted) react with each other to form a siloxane bridge (Si-O-Si), with the release of a water or alcohol molecule.\n(RO)3Si-OH + HO-Si(OR)3^(RO)3Si-O-Si(OR)3 + H2O (c)\n(RO)3Si-OR + HO-Si(OR)3^(RO)3Si-O-Si(OR)3 + ROH (d)\nThe sol-gel process can also be described from the physical point of view, as transitions between a solution, a sol - composed of dispersed colloids - and a gel. At the beginning of the process (reaction (a)) of the initially homogeneous solution is transformed into a colloidal solution. A sol is by definition a fluid Colloidal system in which the dispersed phase is so small (-1-1000 nm) that gravitational forces are considered to be negligible and interactions are dominated by short-range forces, such as van der Waals attraction and surface charges. As the process goes on, (reactions (c) or (d)) the dimensions of the molecules become bigger; the system transforms into a gel when the inorganic network reaches the macroscopic scale over the solution. The gelation point is attained when all the growing clusters connect with each other. During the aging process variations in the structure and properties of the materials take place. Another fundamental step is the drying process: (a) Under normal conditions, an important contraction of the gelified network results (5 to 10-fold decrease compared with the wet starting gel). The materials obtained under these conditions are called xerogels. Xerogels are interesting materials because of their porosity and high surface area, which make them useful for catalysis or sensing [45]. (b) Under supercritical conditions, there is a minimal contraction. The final product is denominated aerogel. Under certain conditions the destruction of the gel network can lead to the formation of powders instead of monoliths during materials formation. (c) Fibers or films may be produced by processing an aged sol (before the gelation point) thanks to a rapid evaporation of the solvent.\nFigure 1.4 shows a schematic diagram representing the stages of the sol-gel process. In this scheme several techniques employed in the sol-gel field to obtain the final materials are also indicated: dip-coating, spin-coating, spray-coating, doctor blading, capillary or meniscus coating, flow-coating and roll-coating.\n\u2022X-ray Direct Writinc \u2022Dip-Pen Nanolithography \u2022Site-Selective Deposition \u2022Conventional Lithography Techniques \u2022Pattern-Transfer Method \u2022Two-photon absorption\nFigure 1.4. Processing routes to materials using sol-gel methods (reproduced from reference\n\u2022Replica Moldinc Techniques \u2022UV Patterninc\n[17]).\nSeveral aspects may influence the sol-gel process: H2O/Si molar ratio, nature of the solvent, pH, type of catalyst, temperature, chemical additives.\nMolar ratio H2O/Si (R): Increasing the R value corresponds to a decrease in the hydrolysis reaction time. For R<<2 reaction (d) is favored. In contrast, reaction (a) is favored for R>>2.\nNature of solvent: The solvents are characterized by their protic or aprotic character, dielectric constant, dipolar moment and polarity index.\npH: The pH affects the mechanism of the overall process, and the microstructure of the materials. The effect of the pH is revealed in the gel time. The polymerization process was divided by Iller [46] into three main regions: pH &lt;2, 2 &lt;pH &lt;7 and pH > 7. At the isoelectric point of silica (between 2.5 and 4.5, depending on different parameters) the reaction rate is minimal, but when the pH is changed the reaction rate also changes.\nCatalyst: The process is catalyzed by acids, bases or nucleophiles (typically fluoride anions (F-)) resulting in different reaction mechanisms which depend on the relative rates between the hydrolysis and condensation reactions.\nIn Scheme 1.1 the mechanisms proposed for each situation are represented (the mechanism of the F--assisted reaction is mostly similar to that of the base-catalyzed\nreaction).\nHO'.....\u25ba si----or \"*\u2014\u25ba\nRo\"\"\"\"'y\nRO\nRO....Si....OR\nHO---Si\nOR\nH\nH\n<---\u25ba\nScheme 1.1. Representation of the mechanisms proposed according to the catalyst employed (adapted from reference [15]).\nConsidering all these aspects the sol-gel process presents several advantages, in particular the mild reaction conditions, the processing versatility, the possibility of mixing the inorganic precursor and organic components at the nanometer scale and the ability of tailoring the final properties of the material through the adequate choice of the organic and inorganic components.\nApplications of organic-inorganic hybrids\nBeyond the inherent fundamental knowledge, organic-inorganic hybrid materials obtained from the sol-gel process have found applications in a wide range of domains: from the fundamental studies to the market place [17, 18, 24, 47, 48]. A possible definition for \u201ccommercial product\u201d could be that it is offered for sale and used in a regular production of a device or item in general commerce [47]. The commercial organic-inorganic hybrids have been part of the manufacturing technology since the 1950s.\nIt is possible to find applications is some different areas such as protective and decorative coating, energy applications, micro-optics, micro-electronics, photonics and optical sensors, ionics, catalysis, human care purposes or construction, automotive,\nsealant, textile and woods [17, 18, 24, 48]. Numerous examples are already commercially available, developed by trademarks (Schott, Toshiba, Variotropic, Essilor, Loreal), in a pre-industrial stage or in a prototyping step [17, and references therein]. Most of the commercial applications are protected as registered patents.\nOne of the first applications of hybrids that appeared in the market was in automotive coatings [47]. Another example comes from television screens by Toshiba, coated with a sol-gel material made of indigo dye embedded in a silicon/zirconia matrix. It is interesting to note that indigo was already used in the ancient Maya Blue [18, 48]. With the expansion of the market in flat panel devices the commercial applications of coated displays also extended. Indeed, coating is one of the most significant areas of application due to the low cost and the easy conditions to prepare quickly new products [17]. Another advantage is based on the fact that is possible to coat a variety of media such as glasses, metals or alloys, plastics, ceramics and papers employing the appropriate processing media, such as spray-, spin- or dip-coatings. These allow the development of different functionalities, protective and/or decorative. Another example often cited in the literature is the use of coating employed in art the conservation, namely on the long term protection of the 14th century \u201cLast Judgement Mosaic\u201d situated in St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague [18].\nIn the field of protection, examples can span from aeronautics to basic household articles. In the first case nanocomposite materials and surface films are being developed for corrosion resistance enhancement and improvement of the adhesion of organic matrix resins on aeronautical parts. In the second case nanocomposites are being employed to solve the long-term durability of the non-stick properties of cookware. One of the first and often referred examples is the glassware coated with dye-containing hybrids [17, 18, 24, 48]. This method has advantages from the visual point of view (increasing the possibility of colors and patterns) and environmental, since the bottles prepared in this way are easy to recycle as uncolored glass. The color of conventional glasses provided by transition metals is very difficult to remove upon remelting. Other example besides decorative coating can be in the field of optical coating, such as anti-reflective thin films or transparent hard-coats [17].\nNowadays due to critical environmental issues (nuclear waste and global warming associated with CO2 emissions) the importance of developing new forms of | 11\nalternative green power energy are unquestionable. Research on the field of fuel cells, lithium batteries, electrochromic devices (ECD) and photovoltaic devices are mandatory, progressive replacement of classical forms of energy (gas, oil) by others environmental friendly. The use of the sol-gel process combined with the organic-inorganic hybrid concept allows potential applications in ECD. These important issues will be discussed in Chapter 3. In fuel cells, organic-inorganic materials which are protonic-based low temperature cell have found wide-spread in class as membranes, active layers or bipolar plates [17].\nHybrid materials have also been employed in several fields of human care such as dental applications, cancer therapy, drug delivery, implants, tissue engineering, body care and cosmetics [17, 18, 20, 21, 24]. The most spread application is on the dental care, where the organic-inorganic hybrid acts as filling composites. The advantage of these composites lies on their properties (appropriate hardness, elasticity, and thermal expansion behavior and non-toxicity) and in the fact that they penetrate easily into the cavity and harden quickly under the effect of blue light [18]. Another common example comes from the commercial sunscreens, where the encapsulation of the active organic UV filters in silica micro-capsules avoids the direct contact of these chemicals with the skin. The same concept was employed to incorporate anti-acne drugs (such as benzoyl peroxide) which are as effective as antibiotics but do not cause bacterial resistance or stomach upset [17].\nSelf-assembly\nAs stated above there are many references in the literature concerning selfassembly, in part because it has been used in numerous fields of research. For example in the materials research field self-assembly is related with the formation of liquid crystals, colloids, lipid bilayers and self-assembled monolayers [49].\nGlobally it is possible to define self-assembly as the result of the spontaneous organization of BBs giving origin to more complex structures, hierarchically organized in a more complex form. The properties obtained in that hierarchical structure may not be exactly the same as those of the starting components.\nThe self-assembly on the materials can be achieved by bottom up or top-down approaches, but in both cases is necessary to consider [9]:\n(a)\tSize, shape and structure of BBs (functional and structural roles).\n(b)\tAttractive and repulsive interactions between BBs and equilibrium separation (consist of interactions such as electrostatics or hydrophobic/ hydrophilic interactions).\n(c)\tReversible association-dissociation of BBs during the organization and lowest energy structure (binding forces are noncovalent interactions that impart stability to the assembled structure and define the final structure)\n(d)\tInteraction between BBs and solvents, interfaces and molds (the environment is the medium in which the sub-unit, forces and assembled structures interact)\n(e)\tDynamic, mass transport (random movement of the BBs which allow them to interact).\nReversibility of the system is achieved due to comparable magnitudes of binding and repulsives forces. A schematic representation of those principles is illustrated in Scheme 1.2\nScheme 1.2. Illustration of the principles of a self-assembled system. BBs (a); repulsive/attractive forces (b); binding forces (c); reaction medium (d); driving forces (e).\nTwo main situations may occur: (a) Molecular or supramolecular templates are present as directing agents in the synthesis solution; (b) The synthesis is spatially restricted by confining the reaction solutions within organized media [12]. In both cases the reaction chemistry, bonding and packing considerations are complemented by the chemical, spatial and structural properties of the template or enclosed reaction environment should complement the reaction chemistry, bonding and packing considerations of the incipient organic phase [12].\nFour strategies may be considered to synthesize organized matter [12]:\n1)\tTranscritive synthesis is the formation of organized inorganic materials by direct templating using preformed self-assembled organic architectures. It can be described by the following sequence:\nSelf-assembly transcription replication\nSome requisites must be fulfilled [12]:\na)\tThe organic template is in place prior to the formation of the inorganic phase.\nb)\tThe organic template should be relatively stable throughout materials synthesis.\nc)\tInteractions of the organic surface should be competitive over analogous processes in bulk solution.\nd)\tPossibility to incorporate surface functional groups that direct interfacial events.\nSome examples of the present strategy may be found from in the control of pore shape and size in the synthesis of zeolites and nanoamorphous silicas and also in the biomineralization field. Davis et al. [50] employed a bacterial superstructure consisting of coaligned multicellular fillaments of Bacillus subtilis as macroscale organic template. The bacterial superstructure that is formed resembles the arrangement of surfactant cylinders [50].\n2)\tSynergistic synthesis implies the mechanistic process in which cooperative interactions between different molecular components give rise to the chemical construction of organized states of matter. It can be described by the following sequence:\nCo-adaptation co-assembly replication\nConsidering an inorganic-organic with a structural and bonding complementarity in the first stage a co-adaptation will be observed. This co-adaptation is influenced by the balance between the thermodynamic and kinetic driving forces (it is sensitive to stoichiometry and relative chemical potentials of the reactants). Under certain conditions, the interfacial energy dominates and gives rise to changes in the spatial charge density and steric requirements at the head-group-silicate interface. Pattern replication then proceeds by further condensation and polymerization of silica within the interstitial spaces of the co-assembled template. The order structure could be achieved in a post-synthesis step with the removal of template.\n3)\tMorphosynthesis is related with chemical transformations in spatially restricted reaction fields to produce materials with complex form. The complex and external morphologies of the final material are \"molded\" in situ by means of an organized and delineated chemical environment. The reactions field could be a static reaction, reconstructive or transitory.\nIn the case of a static reaction field the main idea is to impose an external spatial boundary which is not significantly changed by the chemical processes.\nThe case of reconstructive reaction fields is represented by the sequence:\nReaction assembly replication metamorphism\nand is better explained with an example. Bicontinuous micro-emulsions are a mixture of oil / water / surfactant. These microemulsions are structured as compartimentalized liquids in which the oil and water components are separated into a highly branched and interconnected nanoscale network. In the first stage the nucleation and initial growth of the inorganic phase appear to replicate the arrangement of the nanoscale water conduits. After that stage the growth is accompanied by reconstruction of localizes regions of the microemulsion structure. The last process results from the development of interactive coupling of the crystallization process and surrounding reaction environment. This is a time-dependent process such that morphological patterns at the micrometer scale evolve from the nanoscale replica through a series of intermediate structures facilitated by the reconstructive properties of organized media.\nIn the case of transitory reaction fields the formation of transient metastable phases is induced and is further employed to generate boundary surfaces and imprint\nReaction assembly transformation replication\n4)\tIntegrative synthesis results from a combination of the different\ntechniques in order to prepare materials with hierarchical structure and morphology.\nWhen self-assembly occurs without the presence of any template (self-direct assembly - SDA) giving origin to materials with ordered hierarchical architectures and well defined morphologies, the forces between the molecules must be weaker: hydrogen bonds, ionic, dipolar, van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions.\nThe importance of hydrogen bonds and the hydrophobic interactions in the structuring of materials will be discussed in the introduction of Chapter 2.\nBiomineralization\nBiomineralization encompasses a wide range of subjects from biology to chemistry and materials science. General definitions on biomineralization and specific aspects related with this subject can be found in textbooks [3] and reviews [51-54].\nBiomineralization can be considered as a widespread phenomenon in Nature leading to the formation of a variety of solid inorganic structures by living organisms. In some cases the biominerals formed are so stable that they never precipitate under ambient conditions [55]. Many examples of living organisms employing biominerals have been reported: crustaceans [6, 54, 56], intracellular crystals in prokaryotes, exoskeletons in protozoa algae, and invertebrates, spicules [55, 57] and lenses [58], bone, teeth, statoliths and otoliths, eggshells, plant or mineral structures [59, 60]. These biologically-produced biominerals are organic-inorganic hybrid composites formed by self-assembling bottom-up approaches under mild conditions, exhibiting extraordinary properties and beauty, as well as controlled hierarchical structures.\nBiominerals are typically organic-inorganic hybrids that are hierarchically organized from the nano- to the macroscopic length scale [3, 54]. The organic compounds of biominerals include proteins, glycoproteins, polysaccharides and other small organic biomolecules. The organic phase occluded in biominerals may or may not be directly involved in biomineralization [61]. The common ions involved in biomineralization are Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Si and Fe as their carbonates, oxalates, sulfates,\nphosphates, hydroxides and oxides. Over 60 biominerals have been identified up to present. Around 50% of them are calcium-based minerals and half of these are calcium phosphates of variable composition. It is also noteworthy that biosilica can be found in diatoms, sponge spicules and in some plants. Biominerals can be amorphous or crystalline: curiously 25% of the biominerals are amorphous in Nature. Because amorphous minerals are isotropic under polarized light and do not diffract X-rays, their presence in biological tissue has often been overlooked. It is particularly difficult to identify and characterize them when a crystalline mineral is present [6]. As an amorphous mineral, it is isotropic and can thus sustain mechanical constraints from all directions and it may be shaped easily by the space in which it forms. Amorphous minerals are less stable and more soluble than crystalline ones [5, 56]. The stabilization of the amorphous phases can be attributed to the incorporation of macromolecules within their structures.\nBiomaterials can generally be molded into specifically designed devices with well defined properties (structure, size, shape) [53]. The functionalities of biominerals range from gravity, support and sensing to navigation [5]. In table 1.1 some of the principal functions of the biominerals found in Nature are listed with the corresponding specific functions. This table is not however exhaustive; it only intends to illustrate the diversity of options. In some cases biominerals are also known and studied because of their contribution to diseases; for example calcium oxalate is found in kidney stones [54].\nBiomineral formation may be understood from the standpoint of a classical crystallization pathway or in the light of a new approach based on the presence of an amorphous precursor [54]. The classical model of crystallization considers growth essentially as an amplification process in which stable nuclei are simply enlarged by unit cell replication without incurring structural changes in the bulk or at the surface [56]. In contrast, crystal growth by aggregation of preformed crystalline BBs is a mesoscale assembly process that results in single crystals with iso-oriented mosaic textures. This process can occur through the coalescence of primary nanoparticles into colloidal aggregates often to uniform size, and their subsequent internal restructuring to produce a crystallographically continuous particle. Alternatively, nanoparticle assemblies of aligned BBs produce chains of oriented nanocrystals. In Figure 1.5 a schematic diagram indicative of this process is represented.\nMineral\tFormula\tOrganism\tLocation\tFunction\nCalcite\tCaCO3\tCrustaceans\tCrab cuticule\tMechanical\nAmorphous\tCaCO3.nH2O\t\t\tStructural\nMg-calcite\tMg, CaCO3\tOctocorals\tSpicules\tsupport\nCalcite\tCaCO3\tBirds\tEggshells\tProtection\n\t\tPlants\tLeaves\t\nAragonite\tCaCO3\tCephalopods\tShell\tBuoyancy\nAmorphous\tCaCO3.nH2O\tPlants\tLeaves\tStorage\nCalcite\tCaCO3\tTribolites\tEye lens\tOptical sensors\nAragonite\tCaCO3\tFish\tHead\tGrinding\nBarite\tBaSO4\tChara\tStatoliths\t\nGypsum\tCaSO4.2H2O\tJellyfish\tStatoconia\t\nFigure 1.5. Alternative mechanisms of growth for single crystals (adapted from reference [56]).\nIn 1983 Mann stated that \u201csince amorphous phases are more soluble than crystalline phases at equilibrium, it seems possible that the formation of amorphous precursors could be widespread in Nature\u201d [62]. This discussion is better understood with the help of the diagram of Figure 1.7 which demonstrates that the crystallization may occur by a sequential process involving structural and compositional modifications\nof amorphous precursors and crystalline intermediates, rather than by a single-step pathway (pathway A). This process is predominantly based on the modification of the activation-energy barriers of nucleation, growth and phase separation. The stable intermediate phase depends on the solubilities of the minerals and on the free energies of activation of their interconversion, all of which being strongly influenced by additives. The corresponding changes in composition and structure usually occur by dissolution-renucleation processes closely associated with the surface and/or the interior of preformed particles [56]. The underlying basic concept is known as Ostwald-Lussac rules. If a solution is supersaturated with respect to more than one phase, the more soluble (least stable) phase is often the first phase to form. After some time and with the appropriate amount of energy the products should transform into the lower energy and more thermodynamically stable phase [62].\nFigure 1.6. Crystallization pathways under thermodynamic and kinetic control (reproduced\nfrom reference [56]).\n1.2.\tObjectives and organization of the thesis\nThe present thesis is composed of five chapters and one appendix. The first (present) chapter corresponds to the introduction and state of the art. The main results obtained throughout this thesis are presented in three main chapters: chapters 2, 3 and 4. Chapter 5 is devoted to conclusions and future perspectives of the work. In Appendix A the summary of the thesis is presented in French.\nIn Chapter 2 typical sol-gel reactions and self-assembly routes have been combined to produce different hierarchically structured materials. This chapter begins with the study of the influence of the solvent on the materials morphology. The final morphology of the lamellar silsesquioxane produced from (EtO)3Si-(CH2)3-Y-(CH2)12-Y-(CH2)3-Si(OEt)3 (Y = urea group and Et = ethyl) using an acid catalyst and a large excess of water, was changed from rigid platelets (L12) [31] to micro-objects that resemble sea sponges (L12D) upon incorporation of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) in the reaction medium. The microstructural modifications observed were ascertained by several techniques. A mechanism for the morphology tuning based on the polarity of the solvent mixture is proposed.\nThe second section of Chapter 2 is related with di-urea alkylene-bridged silsesquioxanes. These materials were designated by the notation C1oCnC1o and are derived from organosilane precursors including decylene chains as side spacers and alkylene chains with variable length as central spacers (EtO)3Si-(CH2)10-Y-(CH2)n-Y-(CH2)10-Si(OEt)3 (n = 7, 9-12; Y = urea group and Et = ethyl). These materials are based on precursors similar to P12 [31] which includes side spacers composed of propylene chains instead of decylene chains. The main goal of this work was to determine the influence of the side spacers S on the structuring and ultimately on the morphology of the P12-derived materials. These new family of hybrids has enabled us to conclude that the length of the side spacers plays a unique role in the structuring of alkylene-based bridged silsesquioxanes. All the samples obtained adopt a lamellar structure.\nThe same synthetic strategy (i.e., the combination of the sol-gel process with self-assembly techniques) was employed to prepare a novel class of hierarchically\nstructured hybrids. These new family of materials were prepared through the reaction of the series of alcohols CYOH (where Y=14, 16 and 22) with (3-isocyanato)propyl triethoxysilane giving rise to a urethane linkages, followed by the sol-gel reactions. The samples were designated as mono-alkyl-urethanesils. The effect of the alkyl chain length and the nature of the cross-link on the the order/disorder phase transition have been analyzed and the influence of the solvent(s) has been explored to yield different morphologies.\nChapter 3 is dedicated to organic-inorganic biohybrids with potential applications in ECDs. The domain of ECDs is an exciting and rapidly-growing field of research. In view of their potential use as electrolytes in ECDs the sol-gel process was used to prepare two novel series of environmentally-friendly doped biohybrids composed of a di-urethane cross-linked siloxane-based host network incorporating short segments of the poly(s-caprolactone) biopolymer, abbreviated as PCL(530).\nA family of materials derived from such hybrid matrix doped with KCF3SO3 were been characterized and preliminary studies of the performance of prototype ECDs incorporating these xerogel materials as electrolytes were carried out.\nWith the primary goal of developing a new family of environmentally friendly multifunctional biohybrid materials displaying simultaneously high ionic conductivity and high luminescence the same host biohybrid matrix was doped with lithium triflate and europium triflate. The mixed cation approach, which basically involves the use of two guest salts instead of a single one, is an attractive procedure that usually results in a significant enhancement of the ionic conductivity of PEs and allows to obtain the luminescence properties. Preliminary tests performed with a prototype ECD was done.\nIn Chapter 4 a biomimetic approach to control the growth of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) systems was applied. CaCO3 is one of the most important biominerals existing in Nature. It has six polymorphic forms: three anhydrous forms (calcite, vaterite and aragonite) and three hydrated forms. In the hydrated forms reference should be made to amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) because it is one of the most instable forms, but at the same time, it is one of the most attractive ones due to its capacity as temporary storage site for calcium carbonate in many organisms.\nACC has a tremendous potential in the orthopedic field owing to its in-growth rate, immunogenicity and to the mechanical strength of the grown bones. Recently the use of macromolecules, such as phytic acid [63], DNA [64], poly(acrylic acid) [65] and poly(ethyleneimine) [66] has provided a biomimetic approach to ACC formation. In the present work we have used a synthetic method proposed by Lee et al. [67] and poly(vinyl)pyrrolidone (PVP) to inhibit the crystallization of ACC. The ACC crystallisation process was monitored in detail by means of several standard techniques during a timescale that ranged from one hour to one year after ACC synthesis.\nBiomineralization in the presence of ionic liquids (ILs), which are molten salts at ambient temperature, is also a challenging field of research. Apart from offering unique characteristics, such as negligible vapor pressure, thermal and chemical stability, chemical tunability and recyclability, ILs have a bright future for inorganic materials synthesis, providing a means to produce materials that are not otherwise available [68]. ILs may act, not only as solvents, but also as reactants and templates. In the present work, we have adopted the synthetic method proposed by Lee et al. [67] and have used several commercial ILs to determine the structural and morphological changes produced on precipitated CaCO3.\nThe surfactants are another class of compounds employed as templates in an attempt of mimicking the morphologies found in Nature. Lee's method reported [67] was applied using the commercial fatty alcohols CYOH employed in Chapter 2 (section 2.3), because they may be classified as non-ionic surfactants.\nThe entire work was done both at the Chemistry Department of the University of Tras-os-Montes e Alto Douro (UTAD) and at the Ecole Normale Superieure de Chimie de Montpellier (ENSCM). A 3-month period was spent at Professor Kuroda's Group at Waseda University, Tokyo (Japan).The samples discussed in section 2.1 and 2.2 (Chapter 2 )were synthesized at ENSCM. Some of the experimental techniques with the corresponding results were obtained in the framework of collaborations and projects.\nFor a full comprehension, the experimental techniques employed throughout the work, as well as the participating collaborators and institutions are listed in Table 1.2.\nCharacterization Technique\tDepartment / University\tFrame of Colaboration\tChapter\n1 H NMR 13 C NMR\tCACTI-University of Vigo\tCQ-VR\t2.3\n\tInstitut Charles Gerhard-ENSCM\t-\t2.1 / 2.2 / 2.3\n29 Si MAS NMR 29 Si CP MAS NMR\tChemistry Department - Aveiro University\tProf. Jo\u00e3o Rocha Prof. Rute S\u00e1 Ferreira\t2.3\n\tInstitut Charles Gerhard-ENSCM\t-\t2.1 / 2.2\n13 C MAS NMR 13 C/ CP MAS NMR\tChemistry and Physics Departments / Aveiro University\tProf. Jo\u00e3o Rocha Prof. Rute S\u00e1 Ferreira\t2.3\n\tInstitut Charles Gerhard-ENSCM\t-\t2.1 / 2.2\nFT-IR\tChemistry Department - UTAD\t-\t2 / 3 / 4\nAttenuated Total Reflectance\tChemistry Department - UTAD\t-\t2.3\nFT-Raman Spectroscopy\tPhysics Department - Aveiro University\tProf. Rute S\u00e1 Ferreira\t2.2 / 3.1\nX-RAY diffraction\tUME-UTAD\tLisete Fernandes\t3.1\n\tPhysics Department - Aveiro University\tProf. L.

Their control is thus of the utmost interest to tailor the properties of a single material depending on the required application.\nIn the past two decades growing attention has been devoted to organic/inorganic hybrid materials, in particular to the class of silsesquioxanes, owing to the attractive combined properties provided by the inorganic network (e.g., thermal/chemical stability and rigidity) and the functional organic fragments [1-2].\nBridged silsesquioxanes (BSs) [3-6] constitute an important family of siliceous materials in which the intimate coexistence of inorganic domains and organic fragments endow them with very interesting perspectives for applications in extraction [7], optics [8-9], catalysis [10], microelectronics [11] or drug delivery [12]. Typically BSs are synthesized by means of the sol-gel process from bridged organosilanes. Although usually obtained as amorphous materials, BSs have also been produced in the form of periodic mesoporous organosilicas [13] via the addition of external templates, or as nanostructured materials via self-templating effects [14].\nThe particular case of the BSs obtained through a combination of self-directed assembly routes and sol-gel reactions offers a wide range of possibilities in terms of morphology fine-tuning. In these systems self-directed assembly [15] of bridged organosilane precursor molecules with general formula (EtO)3Si-S2-Y-Si-Y-S2-Si(OEt)3 (where the central spacer S1 is an alkylene chain with variable length (-(CH2)n-), an arylene or a cyclohexylene group, the side spacers S2 are short alkylene chains (-(CH2)m-) (in general propylene chains, m = 3) and the cross-link Y is the urea (-NHC(=O)NH-) group) is governed by the growth of a supramolecular architecture that acts as internal structure directing agent [16-22]. The driving forces of the process are weak interactions (hydrogen bonds formed between Y groups and\tand/or\nhydrophobic interactions established between S1 moieties) which yield hierarchically\nBS hybrids exhibiting chiral helical morphology were produced from (EtO)3Si-S2-Y-(C6H10)-Y-S2-Si(OEt)3 (where S2 = -(CH2)3-) (R,R) and (S,S) enantiopure precursors [23]. Chirality transcription from the cyclohexyl-based enantiomers depends critically on the experimental conditions. Acid catalysis yielded right- or left-handed helical fibres, respectively, or a featureless granular solid from the racemic mixture. Basic catalysis led to the formation of hollow tubular or spherical organosilica from the enantiopure compounds or the racemic mixture, respectively [24, 25]. Interestingly, it was later shown that under acidic catalysis the length of the side spacer S2 could also play an important role in the morphology of the resulting hybrids [26]. Materials incorporating propylene and butylene (S2 = -(CH2)4-) side spacers consisted of fiber-like structures. Although chirality transcription prevailed, helicity was reversed, demonstrating an odd/even effect due to the odd or even number of carbon atoms in the S2 chain. Platelike shapes were formed instead from the precursors containing pentylene (-(CH2)5-) and decylene (-(CH2)10-) side spacers. A lamellar structure was observed in the hybrid\nwith the longest S2 chain [26].\nThe case of the di-urea cross-linked alkyl-based silsesquioxane precursor\n(EtO)3Si(CH2)3NHC(=O)NH(CH2)12NHC(=O)NH(CH2)3Si(OEt)3 (P12) (Scheme 2.1). in\nsection 2.1) is of particular interest, as it yields lamellar, long-range ordered materials\nunder certain conditions. A more detailed presentation will be given in the next\nchapters.\nEtO\nEtO \\\n>\nEtO\nO\nII\nx-CX N\tN\nI\tI\nHH\nH\nI x zN\nC\nII\nO\nOEt\n/^OEt\n\u2022Si&lt;OEt\nH\nI N\nScheme 2.1. Representation of di-urea cross-linked alkyl-based silsesquioxane precursor\n(adapted from reference [15]).\nThe reports on silsesquioxanes derived from organosilanes with a pending chain are significantly less abundant. The basic concept behind this approach is that organoalkoxysilanes or organochlorosilanes containing hydrophobic tails become amphiphilic when silanol groups are formed by hydrolysis [27, 28]. The first example to\nappear involving the hydrolysis and condensation of alkyltriethoxysilanes (CnH2n+1Si(OEt)3 n = 12-18 [29] was reported by Shimojima et. al [29] ( Scheme 2.2). The formation of layered structures through the polycondensation of n-alkyltrichlorosilanes was first reported by Parikh [30].\nH3C\nzCl\nSi\u2014Cl\nCl\nHydrolysis --------------- H3C\nn\nOH\nSi\u2014OH\n\\\nOH\nSelf-assembly\tLayered hybrids\nPolyconsensation\tbi|ayer structures\nor\nH3C\nn= 12-18\nOEt\nSi\u2014OEt \\\nOEt\nScheme\n2.2. Self-assembly of hydrolysed organosilanes into\nmultilayered siloxane hybrids\n(adapted from reference [27]).\nLater alkoxytrichlorosilanes (n-CnH2n+1OSiCl3, n= 12, 14, 16, 18 and 20) were also used in the same context as single precursors [31]. A schematic representation is indicated in Scheme 2.3.\nH3C\nn= 12 - 20\nzCl Si\u2014Cl \\\nCl\nHydrolysis\nH3C\nn\nOH\nSi\u2014OH \\\nOH\nSelf-assembly\n_____________ Layered silica -\nalcohol nanocomposite Polyconsensation\n\nScheme 2.3. Formation of layered silica-alcohol nanocomposites from alkoxytrichlorosilanes (adapted from reference [27]).\nThe strategy was further developed to produce a variety of nanostructured hybrids by keeping the hydrophobic chains and branching the trimethoxysilyl group (CnH2n+1Si(OSi(OMe)3)3) yielding lamellar structures (n = 16) or two dimensional (2D) hexagonal hybrids depending on the alkyl chain length (n = 6-13) [32, 33]. Recently tridimensional (3D) mesostructured mesophases were obtained from a branched heptasiloxane precursor [34].\nRecently a hierarchically-structured mono-amide cross-linked alkylene/siloxane hybrid (derived from the alkylsilane (CH3(CH2)14C(=O)NH(CH2)3Si-(OR)3), where selfassembly is driven by hydrogen bonding between amide groups and tail-to-tail hydrophobic interactions between the alkyl chains, was reported [35]. This material is the first example of a photoluminescent bilayered suprastructure displaying a unique\norder-disorder phase transition of the alkylene chains. Recovery of the emission energy is time-dependent [35].\n/\tO\nII\nXO-Si(CH2)3-N C-(CH2)14-CH3\no I\nh\nScheme 2.4.

Fernandes, X. Cattoen, V. de Zea Bermudez, M. Wong Chi Man\nCrystEngComm, 2011, 13, 1410-1415\n2.1.\tSolvent-controlled morphology of lamellar silsesquioxanes:\nfrom platelets to microsponges\n2.1.1.\tIntroduction\nWell-defined morphology is a key parameter for the fine-tuning of the properties of silsesquioxane-type hybrids which are strongly dependent on the synthetic procedure.\nThe case of the di-urea cross-linked alkyl-based silsesquioxane precursor (EtO)3Si(CH2)3NHC(=O)NH(CH2)12NHC(=O)NH(CH2)3Si(OEt)3 (P12) (Scheme 2.1.1) is particularly interesting. This simple molecule may undergo, not only classical sol-gel reactions, but also self-directed assembly processes that rely on the establishment of van der Waals interactions between the hydrophobic bridging alkyl chains and intense hydrogen bonding between neighboring urea groups. In terms of morphology, it is extremely versatile.\nChanges in the reaction medium induce dramatic alterations, not only in the degree of order, but especially in the dimension and design of the final material. While the hydrochloric acid (HCl)-catalyzed synthesis carried out in a large excess of water (molar ratio P12:H2O:HCl=1:600:0.2) led to the formation of the crystalline lamellar structure L12 (Figure 2.1.1 (a) and Scheme 2.1.1) [1-4], the use of the ammonium fluoride (NH4F) catalyst in ethanol (EtOH) and a stoichiometric amount of water (molar ratio P12/H2O/EtOH/NH4F=1:6:6O:O.O1) yielded the amorphous material A12 exhibiting a granular-like morphology [2] or an irregular microsphere shape with a rough surface composed of plates (Figure 2.1.1 (b)) [5].\no\n(EtOfeSi^^x^N\nP12\nN\nH\nSi(OEt)3\nH2O, dmso, HCI\n-------------\u25ba L12D\nO\nScheme 2.1.1. Syntheses of the L12 and L12D hybrids.\nFigure 2.1.1. Different morphologies of the hybrids derived from the P12 precursor: L12 (a)\n(reproduced from reference [6]), A12 (b) (reproduced from reference [5]), Eu@A12-1 (c)\n(reproduced from reference [5]) and Eu@A12-2 (d) (reproduced from reference [5]).\nThe structuring role played by lanthanide ions on the synthesis of the hybrids derived from the P12 precursor under both types of reaction conditions has been reported more recently [5-7]. Upon adoption of the HCl-catalyzed-hydrolytic route and addition of Eu3+ ions (molar ratio P12:H2O:HCl:EuCl3=1:600:0.2:x, where x=0.05, 0.95 and 2.9) another family of highly organized photoluminescent silsesquioxanes (Eu@L12) displaying a lamellar morphology was introduced [6, 7]. In contrast, the combination of NH4F-catalyzed sol-gel reactions and Eu3+ doping resulted in the production of a series of photoluminescent silsesquioxanes Eu@A12 for which the morphology and size can be readily tuned through the control of the amount of Eu3+ incorporated: (1) Microfibers or twisted microbundles made of nanoplates assembled in a tile-to-tile arrangement are formed at low Eu3+ concentration (Eu@A12-1) (molar ratio P12/H2O/EtOH/NH4F/EuCl3=1:6:60:0.01:0.74) (Figure 2.1.1\t(c)), whereas\ndumbbell-like micro-objects result at high Eu3+ concentration (Eu@A12-2) (molar ratio P12/H2O/EtOH/NH4F/EuCl3.=1:6:60:0.01:1.42) (Figure 2.1.1 (d)) [5].\nIn this work we have been able to produce a silsesquioxane hybrid derived from the P12 precursor with a completely different morphology. The new synthetic method adopted here is a modification of the route employed earlier to prepare L12, the only change introduced being the incorporation of a large excess of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to the reaction medium [8]. The presence of the latter solvent induced the formation of a material (henceforth designated as L12D) with a microsphere-like shape that closely resembles sea sponges. In an attempt to explain the independent roles played by water and DMSO in the production of the L12 platelets and the L12D microsponges, respectively, both materials have been examined in depth using several techniques that provide rich structural information, specially X-ray diffraction (XRD)Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Polarized Optical Microscopy (POM), 13C and 29Si Cross Polarization / Magic Angle Spinning (CP/MAS) Nuclear Magnetic Ressonance (NMR), nitrogen (N2) adsorption-desorption measurements and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR).\n2.1.2.\tExperimental part\nMaterials\nWater was distilled prior to use. HCl solution and DMSO ((CH3)2S=O) were purchased from Carlo Erba and SDS (synthesis grade)), respectively.\nSynthesis of L12D\nP12 was obtained according to a procedure described elsewhere [2]. This compound (1.1 g, 1.6 mmol) was dissolved in DMSO (45 mL, 0.63 mol) at 80 \u00b0C. After cooling, water (12.6 mL, 0.70 mol) was added to the gelified mixture. The resulting mixture was heated up to 80 \u00b0C and 2.8 mL of 0.1 M HCl aqueous solution (0.28 mmolHCl and 0.16 molH2O) was then added under vigorous stirring (final molar ratio P12/DMSO/H2O/HCl=1:388:527:0.175). The reaction medium was kept under these conditions during 4 days. After this period, 657 mg of a white powder were recovered by filtration, washed successively with water, ethanol, acetone and water, and finally freeze-dried overnight.\nCharacterization of the material\nThe sample for Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) was transferred to an open platinum pan and analysed using a TA Instruments Q50 thermobalance at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min-1 using dry N2 as purge gas (40 mL min-1 balance and 60 mL min-1 sample). Prior to measurement, the sample was vacuum-dried over phosphorus pentoxide for several days.\nSolid state 13C and 29Si CP/MAS NMR experiments were recorded on a Varian VNMRS 400 MHz spectrometer using a two channel probe with 7.5 mm diameter-size ZrO2 rotors and TMS as reference for the chemical shifts.\nThe SEM images were obtained with a Hitachi S-4800 apparatus after platinum metallization.\nTEM micrographs were obtained using a SEM/ESEM-FEI Quanta 400 scanning electron microscope at high-acceleration voltage (25 kV) and a LEO 906 E Leica microscope. The TEM images were printed as photographs using KODAK Electron film negatives.\nAFM images were recorded using a Veeco Metrology Multimode/Nanoscope IVA equipment (CEMUP-Porto contract REEQ/1062/CTM/2005), in tapping mode using a super sharp silicon tip, curvature radius 10 nm, and frequency resonance equals to -300 KHz. Flattening and elimination of line noise tools and a Lowpass filter provided by the WSXM software [9] were used to improve the quality of the images.\nPOM images were recorded with a Leitz Ortholux II Pol microscope. The images were obtained throught a digital camera Leica DC 100 and were analyzed with a software Leica IM50 (version 1.20).\nN2 adsorption-desorption experiments were performed on a Micromeritics ASAP2020 apparatus after outgassing the material for 30 hours at 55 \u00b0C.\nXRD measurements of the dried powder samples were carried out in 1.5-mm-diameter glass capillaries in a transmission configuration. A copper rotating anode X-ray source working at 4 kW with a multilayer focusing Osmic monochromator giving high flux and punctual collimation was employed. An image plate 2D detector was used.\nFT-IR spectra were acquired using a Mattson Mod7000 spectrometer. The spectra were collected in the 4000-500 cm-1 range by averaging 64 scans at a\nresolution of 4 cm-1. The solid samples (2 mg) were finely ground and mixed with approximately 175 mg of dried KBr (Merck, spectroscopic grade) and pressed into pellets. Prior to recording the spectra the pellets were stored under vacuum for about 24 hours at approximately 60 \u00b0C to reduce the levels of adsorbed water. To evaluate complex band FT-IR envelopes and to identify underlying spectral components, the iterative least-squares curve-fitting procedure in the PeakFit software [10] was used. The best fit of the experimental data was obtained using Gaussian shapes and by varying the frequency, bandwidth and intensity of the bands. A linear baseline correction with a tolerance of 0.2% was employed. The standard errors of the curve-fitting procedure were less than 0.03.\n2.1.3.\tResults and discussion\nL12D was synthesized from a mixture of P12, water, DMSO and HCl in a molar ratio P12:DMSO:H2O:HCl = 1:388:527:0.175 at 80 \u00b0C (Scheme 2.1.1). It was obtained as a white powder after filtration, washing and freeze-drying.\nThe TGA curve of L12D (Figure 2.1.2) reveals that this hybrid sample is thermally stable up to 245 \u00b0C in a non-oxidizing atmosphere. Between this temperature and approximately 400 \u00b0C, a dramatic weight loss (ca. 60%) takes place. Between the latter temperature and 700 \u00b0C, the rate of thermal degradation is considerably lower. At the maximum temperature examined, about 20% of the mass of the sample still has not suffered thermal decomposition.\nFigure 2.1.2.TGA curve of L12D.\nThe 29Si CP/MAS NMR spectrum of L12D (Figure 2.1.3 (a)) exhibits signals peaking at -48, -57 and -67 ppm attributed to the T1 (C-Si(OSi)(OR)2), T2 (C-Si(OSi)2(OR)) and T3 (C-Si(OSi)3) silicon environments, respectively, where R = H or Et. The condensation degree c (where c = 1/3 (%T1 + 2 %T2 + 3 %T3)) was estimated to be ca. 71%. The similarity found between this value and those reported for the lamellar L12 material [1, 2, 5, 6] and for lamellar alkylsiloxanes [11] suggests the occurrence of a two dimensional siloxane framework in the silsesquioxane L12D and consequently the formation of linear polymer siloxane linkages despite the significant steric hindrance associated with the alkyl groups. This explanation is corroborated by the existence of a major proportion of T2 units in this material. We note, however, that the presence of T1 and T3 units is indicative of partial variation in the siloxane linkage. The absence of Q-type (SiO4) environments (characteristic resonances expected at 5 = -90 to -120 ppm) demonstrates the full preservation of the C-Si bonds in the final hybrid material.\nThe latter conclusion is further corroborated by the presence of a signal at 12 ppm typical of the CH2-Si group in the 13C CP/MAS NMR spectrum of L12D (Figure 2.1.3 (b)). As expected, the C=O of the urea groups gives rise to a sharp signal at 160 ppm (full-width-at-half-maximum (fwhm) = 2.2 ppm). The ill-resolved and very weak peaks located at 58 ppm and 18 ppm, associated with the resonance of the ethoxy carbon atoms (CH3CH2-O and CH3CH2-O, respectively), demonstrate that the hydrolysis reaction was practically complete. The internal methylene carbon atoms of the alkylene chains appear between 30 and 35 ppm. The pair of prominent resonances distinguishable at 34 and 31 ppm in Figure 2.1.3) are ascribed to carbon atoms of ordered alkylene chains (i.e., densely packed all-trans chains) and amorphous domains (i.e., disordered chains that adopt essentially gauche conformations), respectively [1214]. Although the all-trans/gauche conformational ratio - estimated through the calculation of the relative integrated areas via curve-fitting using Lorentzian functions -practically coincides for L12D and L12, the fwhm is higher for L12D than for L12 (2.9 and 1.2 ppm, respectively), suggesting a higher chain conformational disorder in the former material.\n(a)\nT2 : Si(OH)(OSi)2\n(b)\nFigure 2.1.3. 29Si CP/MAS (a) and 13C (b) CP/MAS NMR spectra of the L12D hybrid.\nThe SEM image depicted in Figure 2.1.4 (a) demonstrates that, unlike L12 which is obtained as platelets, the L12D material is produced as micrometric spheres with a diameter of ca. 10-50 pm. Higher magnification clearly reveals that the microspheres display a sponge-like morphology, which consists of very thin, folded films assembled along an edge-to-face fashion (Figures 2.1.4 (b-d)). The existence of very thin films that are subject to folding was confirmed by TEM (Figure 2.1.5).\nAlthough L12D displays essentially void-like structure, only a low specific surface area of 35 m2g-1 (a value similar to that reported for L12 (42 m2g-1) [2]), was measured by N2 adsorption-desorption analysis (Figure 2.1.6). The uptake at high p/p\u00b0 results from the condensation of N2 in the voids between the films.\nInterestingly, the L12D material exhibits anisotropic character, as evidenced by the POM image recorded between crossed polarizers (Figure 2.1.7). The birefringence observed suggests submicrometric anisotropy.\n\nFigure 2.1.4. SEM images of the L12D hybrid at different magnifications: (a) 30 p.m; (b) and (c)\n6 p.m; (d) 3.75 p.m.\nFigure 2.1.5.

Profile plot (c) corresponding to the line drawn in (b).\n\nComparison of the XRD patterns of L12D and L12 represented in Figure 2.1.10 allows concluding that the pattern produced by the hybrid synthesized in the present work is clearly less well resolved than that of L12. The peaks detected in the low q (where q is the wave vector^ range at 2.17, 6.52 and 8.72 nm 1 in the diffractogram of L12D correspond to the 1st, 3rd and 4th orders (see inset of Figure 2.1.10) of a lamellar structure with a characteristic interlamellar spacing l (where l = n2n/qn and n is the reflection order) of 2.85 nm. This value is slightly lower than the estimated length of the organic spacer (3.16 nm) [15]. In the high q range, the peak at 13.0 nm-1 (d = 0.48 nm) is associated with the separation between two neighbouring urea groups in the self-associated urea-urea hydrogen-bonded array [5, 6] and the prominent broad peak at 15.1 nm-1 (d = 0.42 nm) (see inset of Figure 2.1.10) is attributed to ordering within the siloxane domains [5, 6]. Both the ill-defined peak at approximately 16.3 and the shoulder seen at approximately 17.0 nm-1 (d = 0.39 and 0.37 nm, respectively) (see inset of Figure 2.1.10) provide information of chain packing density and in-plane chainchain ordering distances. The former peak is related with chains in gauche conformations and the latter to chains in all-trans conformations (highly packed and thus closer) [5, 6]. All the characteristic distances of L12D indicated above are in perfect agreement with those reported earlier for L12 [1].\nFigure 2.1.10. XRD patterns of the L12 (black line) (reproduced from reference [2]) and L12D (red line) hybrids.\nTo assess the influence of DMSO on the extent and strength of hydrogen bonding, we decided to examine the spectral signature of L12D in the 1800-1500 cm-1 interval of the FT-IR spectrum and compare it with that of L12. This spectral region is of the utmost interest because it is where the amide I and amide II vibration modes absorb. The amide I mode (1800-1600 cm-1), essentially due to the C=O stretching vibration, [16] is sensitive to the specificity and magnitude of hydrogen bonding. Usually the amide I band consists of several distinct components which correspond to different C=O environments or aggregates. As the absorption coefficients of C=O groups involved in different aggregates are likely to be different, it is not correct to compare the intensity of the different components. Consequently, only the changes undergone by each component are an adequate indication of concentration variations of each type of aggregate [16, 17]. The amide II mode (1600-1500 cm-1), mainly associated with a N-H in-plane bending vibration, is sensitive to both chain conformation and intermolecular hydrogen bonding, providing valuable information about the distribution of hydrogen bond strengths [16]. In the case of urea-containing compounds, these modes have been designated as \u201camide I\u201d and \u201camide II\u201d modes, respectively.\nThe pair of broad bands centered at 1625 and 1583 cm-1 in the spectrum of L12D depicted in Figure 2.1.11 are ascribed to the \u201camide I\u201d and \u201camide II\u201d modes, respectively.\nWavenumber (cm-1)\nFigure 2.1.11. Curve-fitting results of the FT-IR spectra of the L12 (a) (reproduced from reference [6]) and L12D (b) hybrids in the \u201camide I\u201d and \u201camide II\u201d regions.\nAs the wavenumber difference (Av = 42 cm-1) between the intensity maxima of these modes coincides for L12 [1] and L12D, one might be wrongly induced to conclude that the strength of the hydrogen-bonded array of urea-urea aggregates is independent of the nature of the solvent used in the synthetic procedure. Closer analysis of Figure 2.1.11 reveals that the band profiles of L12 and L12D are significantly different as a result of band redistribution. In fact the proportion of disordered aggregates responsible for the 1647 cm-1 component [6] increases in L12D at the expense of the destruction of the ordered aggregates that give rise to the component at 1625 cm-1 [6]. As a consequence, the integrated area of the \u201camide II\u201d component at 1564 cm-1 increases, whereas that of the 1583 cm-1 feature decreases. These results give support to the explanation that the addition of a mixture of water/DMSO to P12 instead of only water leads to the formation of more disordered hydrogen-bonded urea-urea aggregates [6]. This conclusion is in perfect agreement with the increase of the fwhm of the urea signal in the 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra of L12 and L12D from 1.5 to 2.2 ppm, respectively (Figure 2.1.3). Besides weakening the hydrogen-bonded ureaurea array, the incorporation of DMSO has no further spectral consequences. It is worth mentioning that the component characteristic of the absorption of \u201cfree\u201d urea groups (i.e., urea groups devoid of any hydrogen bonding interactions), expected at 1751 cm-1 [18] is not detected in the \u201camide I\u201d region of either L12 or L12D (Figure\n2.1.11).\nTo explain why the synthesis of the lamellar L12 material in the presence of only water yields platelets, whereas the one carried out in a water/DMSO mixture gives rise to the formation of microsponges, we propose a mechanistic interpretation based on the physico-chemical properties of these two solvents. With respect to aprotic DMSO, water is a solvent with higher dielectric constant (s20 \u00b0C = 46.68 and 80.10, respectively), but lower dipolar moment (li2- \u00b0C = 4.1 D and p 20 \u00b0C = 1.87 D, respectively). Furthermore, both solvents have high polarity indexes (7.2 and 10.2, respectively). The dielectric constant of the water/DMSO mixture used in this study molar ratio DMSO:water = 527:328 was estimated to be 68 \u00b1 6 [20]. We believe that the reason for the different morphologies of L12 and L12D is likely to be found at an advanced stage of the synthetic mechanism (Figure 2.1.12). In the first step of the synthetic procedure the acidic hydrolysis of P12 leads to the formation of a bis(silanetriol) amphiphilic precursor compound [18], soluble in water and in the\nwater/DMSO mixture. Strong intermodular forces between neighbor molecules, such as hydrogen bonding between the urea groups or between the silanol functionalities [21], as well as van der Waals interactions between the alkylene chains, promote the formation of the siloxane network, leading ultimately to the formation and organization of thin lamellar ribbons (A) (Figure 2.1.12). Therefore the growing supramolecular architecture acts itself as an internal template directing the organization of the hybrid silica. Owing to the low pH of the reaction medium, the protonation of the silanol and urea groups of the growing structured objects (A) is expected to take place. The influence of the nature of the solvent on the structuring of P12 at the micrometer scale, which ends up with the formation of platelets in the case of L12 and microsponges in the case of L12D, might operate at this stage.\nFigure 2.1.12. Proposed mechanism for the formation of the L12 and L12D hybrids. For the sake of clarity the Cl- ions have been omitted.\nA plausible explanation for the different shapes of the two materials is the following. In water, the hydrophobic interactions between the alkylene chains promote face-to-face stacking of lamellar ribbons (A), leading ultimately to the formation of 3D platelets (L12) (Figure 2.1.12). Such a stacking is aided by the high charge mobility and the low charge repulsions that occur in water. In contrast, DMSO strongly interacts with the lipophilic alkylene chains, thus stabilizing the growing ribbons (A). Furthermore, the lower charge mobility in the water/DMSO mixture and the lower dielectric constant disfavor face-to-face stacking, privileging edge-to-face approach of the charged ribbons, which ultimately yields sponge-like micro-objects (L12D). Folding, enabled by the films' low thickness, contributes to the final morphology observed.\n2.1.4.\tConclusions\nA novel type of morphology has been obtained for a hybrid silica prepared through acidic hydrolysis/condensation of the P12 precursor using a water/DMSO mixture. The hydrogen bonds established between the urea groups, as well as the van der Waals forces between the long alkyl chains are the main driving forces that govern the ordering of the precursor molecule into a lamellar assembly. Although L12 and L12D resemble closely both from the chemical and nanostructural standpoint, we show in this work that the nature of the solvent plays a major role on the shaping of the final material. We propose that the balance between attractive and repulsive interactions occurring at a late stage of the synthetic process is the key parameter that controls the final microstructure of L12 and L12D.\nThe results reported here represent an important step forward in the comprehension of the processes governing the formation of self-organized hybrid siliceous materials.\n2.1.5.\tReferences\n1.\tJ.

In this class of hybrids the degree of order of the hybrids increases with the length of the central spacer S1. Chains with less than 8 methylene groups lead to, however, to disordered materials regardless of the reaction conditions employed [2-4]. It was also demonstrated that the synthetic procedure adopted exerts a dramatic influence on the final morphology [1-12].\nThe case of the dodecylene (n=12)-based precursor P12 is worth mentioning in this context, as it is an excellent example of easy-tuning of the degree of order, dimension and design of the final hybrid compound via judicious modification of the reaction conditions, such as the type of catalyst [1, 2-14], the P12:H2O molar ratio [1,3-\n5]\tand the addition of Eu3+ ions [5, 6]. In the last section we demonstrated the crucial role played by the nature of the solvent(s) [7].\nIn the present section we will report on studies carried out with the goal of determining the influence of the side spacers S2 on the structuring, morphology and ultimately on the optical properties of the P12-derived materials. We have investigated for this purpose a series of alkylene-based hybrid materials (henceforth designated as Ci0CnCi0) derived from silsesquioxane precursors similar to P12 including side spacers S2 composed of decylene chains instead of propylene chains (EtO)3Si-(CH2)10-Y-(CH2)n-Y-(CH2)10-Si(OEt)3 with n = 7, 9-12 (P10-n-10). Because of the higher proportion of organic component, the solubility of the precursor molecules in water is lower than that of the Pn precursor molecules. This problem was overcome through the use of a water/DMSO mixture. The molar ratio P10-n-\n10:H2O:DMSO:HCl=1:527:388:0.175 employed here coincides with that used in the previous section to prepare the sponge-like L12D material [7, 12].\n2.2.2.\tExperimental part\nMaterials\nThe a.c>-diaminoalkanes were purchased from Aldrich (1,7-diaminoheptane, NH2-C7-NH2,\t97%), Acros (1,9-diaminononane, NH2-C9-NH2,\t98%, and 1,10-\ndiaminodecane, NH2-C10-NH2, 97%), ABCR (1,11-diaminoundecane, NH2-C11-NH2, 97%) and Fluka (1,12-diaminododecane,\tNH2-C12-NH2,\t97%).\t10-\nisocyanatodecyltriethoxysilane (ICDTES) was prepared according to a procedure described elsewhere [13]. Dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and pentane were dried over CaH2 and freshly distilled prior to use. Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, (CH3)2S=O, SDS, synthesis grade), ethanol and acetone were used as received.\nSynthesis of the bridged organosilanes\nThe precursors P10-n-10 were synthesized in Schlenk tubes under anhydrous conditions (Scheme 2.2.1) and stored under a dry atmosphere of nitrogen (N2). In a typical experiment, ICDTES (1.96 g, 5.6 mmol) was added to a CH2Cl2 solution (60 mL) of the diamine (2.6 mmol) at room temperature. A precipitate formed within a few minutes. After 24 hours, the solvent was removed under vacuum, and the residue was washed with pentane (40 mL). After drying, the bis(urea) compound was obtained as a white wax.

Synthetic scheme of the reaction.\nSynthesis of the BSs\nIn a typical experiment a mass of P10-n-10 (1.2 mmol) was heated in DMSO (33 mL, 464 mmol) until the solution got clear. While cooling to room temperature, the mixture gelified. After addition of water (9.3 mL, 517 mmol), the mixture was warmed up to 80 \u00b0C. To the resulting cloudy solution, a solution of HCl (0.1 N, 2.1 mL, 0.21 mmolHCl and 117 mmolH2O) was added. The molar ratio of P10-n-10:DMSO:H2O:HCl was 1:388:527:0.175. The mixture was stirred for 1 hour at 80 \u00b0C, then kept under static conditions at the same temperature for 4 days. The resulting gel/precipitate was filtered off, washed successively with water, ethanol, acetone and water, and then freeze-dried overnight.\nCharacterization of the material\n29Si and 13C solid state NMR spectra and SEM, AFM and POM images were recorded using the equipments and procedures described in section 2.1.\nSome TEM micrographs were obtained using the equipment and procedure described in section 2.1. Some others were obtained using a JEOL 1200 EX2 apparatus equipped with a SIS Olympus Quemesa 11 Mpixel camera. These pictures were treated using the ImageJ software.\nThe XRD patterns were recorded at room temperature with a Rigaku Geigerflex D/max-c diffractometer system using monochromated CuKa radiation (X = 1.54 A) over the 20 range of between 4 and 70\u00b0 at a resolution of 0.05\u00b0. The samples were not subject to any thermal pre-treatment.\nSmall Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS): The SAXS spectra were recorded at the National Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS), Campinas (Brazil), using a SAXS beam line which provides a monochromatic (X=1.608 A) and horizontally focused beam. A vertical position-sensitive X-ray detector and a multichannel analyser were used to record the SAXS intensity, I(q), as a function of modulus of the scattering vector q = 4rc/X- sin (e/2), s being the X-ray scattering angle. The parasitic scattering intensity from air, slits, and windows was subtracted from the total intensity. The scattering intensity was also normalized by taking into account the varying intensity of the direct X-ray beam, sample absorption and sample thickness.\nFourier Transform Raman (FT-Raman): The FT-Raman spectra were recorded at room temperature with a Bruker RFS 100/S spectrometer equipped with a nearinfrared Nd:YAG laser with wavelength excitation (1064 nm at 400 mW). The spectra were collected over the 3200-300 cm-1 range by averaging 200 scans at a maximum resolution of 4 cm-1.\nFT-IR spectra were recorded using the equipment and procedure described in section 2.1. Curve-fitting of complex FT-IR and FT-Raman band envelopes were carried out using the procedure described in detail in section 2.1.\nPhotoluminescence (PL): The PL spectra were recorded at room temperature and at 12 K with a modular double grating excitation spectrofluorimeter with a TRIAX 320 emission monochromator (Fluorolog-3, Jobin Yvon-Spex Horiba Scientific) coupled to a R928 Hamamatsu photomultiplier, using the front face acquisition mode. The excitation source was a 450 W Xe arc lamp. The emission spectra were corrected for detection and optical spectral response of the spectrofluorimeter and the excitation spectra were corrected for the spectral distribution of the lamp intensity using a photodiode reference detector. The lifetime measurements were acquired with the setup described for the luminescence spectra using a pulsed Xe-Hg lamp (6 ps pulse at half width and 20-30 ps tail). The absolute emission quantum yields were measured at room temperature using a quantum yield measurement system C9920-02 from Hamamatsu with a 150 W Xenon lamp coupled to a monochromator for wavelength discrimination, an integrating sphere as sample chamber and a multichannel analyzer for signal detection. Three measurements were made for each sample so that the average value is reported. The method is accurate to within 10%.\n2.2.3.\tResults and discussion\nThe 29Si MAS NMR spectra of the C10CnC10 materials display three broad signals centered at -47, -58 and -68 ppm (Figure 2.2.1 and Table 2.2.1) ascribed to T1, T2 and T3 silicon sites, respectively. The condensation degrees deduced (Table 2.2.1) are of the same order of magnitude as those reported previously for the lamellar L12 material [1, 2, 5] and more recently for the sponge-like L12D material (see section 2.1) [7].

The absence of Q-type (SiO4) resonances between -90 and -120 ppm in the 29Si MAS NMR spectra (not shown) is a proof of the preservation of the C-Si bonds in the C10CnC10 samples. The 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra of the hybrid samples (Figure 2.2.2) also provides evidence of the preservation of the Si-C bond (peak located at about 14 ppm) and also proves that no cleavage of the functional groups of the precursor molecule, i.e., central spacer alkylene chains, side spacer decylene chains and urea cross-links, occurred during the synthesis of the C10CnC10 BSs. The absence of the peaks characteristic of ethoxyl carbon atoms at about 58 and 18 ppm demonstrate that the hydrolysis reaction was complete.\n(b)\nn\n11\n9\n7\na\nFigure 2.2.2. 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra of the C10CnC10 bridged silsesquioxanes with even n (a) and odd n (b).\nTable 2.2.1. 29Si MAS NMR and 13C CP/MAS data of the Ci0CnCi0 bridged silsesquioxanes (8 in ppm).\n*c (polycondensation degree) = 1/3(%T1 + 2%T2 + 3%T3)x100 ; Note: R = -C10H20-(NHC(=O)NH)-(CH2)n-(NHC(=O)NH)- C10H20-\n8 (integral fraction) 29Si NMR\t\t\t\t\t\nn = 7\tn = 9\tn = 10\tn = 11\tn = 12\tAttribution\n-47.9 (10%)\t-48.1 (13%)\t-48.4 (12%)\t47.4 (10%)\t-48.9 (13%)\tT1 -R-Si(OSi)(OH)2\n-57.2 (64%)\t-56.7 (66%)\t-57.5 (71%)\t-57.0 (63%)\t-57.6 (65%)\tT2-R-Si(OSi)2(OH)\n-67.4 (26%)\t-67.7 (21%)\t-67.4 (16%)\t-67.7 (27%)\t-67.8 (22%)\tT3-R-Si(OSi)3\n72\t69\t68\t72\t69\tc\nR[Si(OH)0.84O1.08]2\tR[Si(OH)0.92O1.04]2\tR[Si(OH)0.96O1.02]2\tR[Si(OH)0.83O1.08]2\tR[Si(OH)0.92O1.04]2\tEmpirical Formula\n8 13C CP/MAS\nn = 7\tn = 9\tn = 10\tn = 11\tn = 12\tAttribution\n159\t161\t160\t161\t159\tNHC(=O)NH\n43\t42\t41\t43\t41\tSi-CH2CH2CH2-N\n\t\t40\t41\t\t\n35\t35\t35\t35\t35\tCH2 trans\n32\t32\t32\t33\t32\t\n-\t-\t30\t-\t30\tCH2 gauche\n25\t24\t23\t25\t24\tSi-CH2CH2CH2-N\n15\t14\t13\t15\t13\tSi-CH2CH2CH2\n62\tHybrids organic-Inorganic materials obtained by sol-gel and self-assembly techniques\nAnalysis of the SEM images reveals that the morphology of C10C7C10 is rather irregular (Figures 2.2.3 (a-b)), whereas that of the C10C9C10 and C10C10C10 samples closely resembles that of L12D [see Figure 2.1.4, section 2.1] [7]. Both materials form micro-objects with a sponge-like morphology (Figures 2.2.3 (c, e), respectively), consisting of very thin, folded films assembled along an edge-to-face fashion (n = 9, Figure 2.2.3 (d) or entangled folded ribbons (n = 10, Figure 2.2.3 (f)). In C10C11C10 the ribbons appear considerably more folded, forming less regular objects (Figures 2.2.3 (g, h)). The process ends up in C10C12C10 with the production of 10 p.m-diameter dense, homogeneous spheroidal particles (Figure 2.2.3 (i)) which tend to link to each other (Figure 2.2.3 (j)).\nThe increasing contribution of the folding process to which the thin films are subject in these materials as the length of the central spacer increases is clearly recognized in the TEM images shown in Figure 2.2.4. The intrinsic ordered nanostructure of the films/ribbons is perfectly evident in the case of samples with n = 9 (Figure 2.2.5 (b)), n = 10 (Figures 2.2.4 (c, d)) and n = 12 (Figure 2.2.4 (h)).\nAdditional proofs of the organized texture of C10C12C10 and in particular C10C10C10 have been obtained by AFM upon scanning the surface of the samples in tapping mode (Figures 2.2.5 (c, b) respectively). The 3D topographic perspective of the BS with n = 10 is given in Figure 2.2.6. The organization fashion observed in both samples is, however, less well distinguishable in the case of the material with n = 9 (Figure 2.2.5 (a)).\nThe anisotropic nature of C10C10C10 is demonstrated in the POM image recorded between crossed polarizers (Figure 2.2.7). The birefringence exhibited indicates submicrometric anisotropy.\nFigure 2.2.3. SEM images of the C10CnC10 bridged silsesquioxanes with n = 7 (scale bars = 6 p.m (a) and 1.20 p.m (b), n = 9 (scale bars = 12 p.m (c) and 2 p.m (d)), n = 10 (scale bars = 6 p.m (e) and 1.20 p.m (f)), n = 11 (scale bars = 20 p.m (g) and 2 p.m (h)) and n = 12 (scale bars = 30 p.m (i) and 6 p.m (j)).\nFigure 2.2.4.

POM image of the C10C10C10 bridged silsesquioxane recorded between crossed polarizers.\nThe XRD patterns of selected samples exhibit completely different profiles in the high q range (q > 10 nm-1) (Figure 2.2.8). While the C10C7C10 material produces a broad, ill-defined and asymmetric peak centered at about 15 nm-1, the intensity maximum of the band is shifted to about 15.7 nm-1 for n = 9 and 11 and a shoulder is visible in the lower q side, especially in the pattern of the former hybrid. In the case of the BS with the longest central spacer S1 (C10C12C10) the band profile becomes better resolved and two peaks centered at 14.7 and 16.2 nm-1 are discerned (Figure 2.2.8). Curve-fitting of the band envelopes performed between 12 and 19 nm-1 by means of Gaussian shapes allowed us to identify four components in the XRD patterns of the samples with n = 7, 9, 11 and 12. The component at lowest q, centered at 13.54 nm-1 (di = 0.464 nm), is attributed to the separation between two neighboring urea groups of the urea-urea hydrogen-bonded array [5-7]. The characteristic component associated with ordering within the siloxane domains is centered at 14.65 nm-1 (d2 = 0.429 nm) [5-7]. The remaining two components, centered at 15.85 nm-1 (d3=0.392 nm) and 17.15 nm-1 (d4=0.366 nm), are ascribed to chain-chain spacings, indicating the occurrence of gauche and all-trans conformers in the alkylene chains, respectively [5-7].\nIn the low q-range (q &lt;10 nm-1) the XRD patterns of the C10CnC10 BSs display narrow peaks which correspond presumably to the higher order (i) harmonics of the fundamental reflection located at q &lt;2 nm -1 (Figure 2.2.8).\nFigure 2.2.8. XRD patterns of selected Ci0CnCi0 bridged silsesquioxanes.\nThis hypothesis is confirmed by the presence of a weak and ill-defined peak at q \u00ab1.47-1.55 nm-1 in the SAXS patterns of the C10CnC10 hybrids with n = 9, 10 and 12 reproduced in Figure 2.2.9 (a). Unfortunately, this peak is masked by the intense scattering produced by the hybrid particles. In fact the linear dependency (slope close to -4) observed in the low q region of the log-log plot depicted in the inset of Figure\n2.2.9\t(a) is in agreement with the Porod power law decay expected for a two-phase system with a well-defined interface. Thus, the two peaks at q > 1 nm-1 correspond to the reflections of inner particles crystalline structure. The position of the higher order Bragg peaks follow the sequence characteristic of a lamellar structure in which the interlamellar distance l is given by l = 2ni/qt (i = 1, 2, 3, ...). The l spacing values calculated on the basis of the SAXS data for the C10CnC10 hybrids are 4.09+0.01 nm for n = 9, 4.13+0.02 nm for n = 10 and 4.24+0.02 nm for n = 12. The increase of l with n supports that the length of the alkylene chains of the central spacer is intimately correlated with the interlamellar distance. This result allows inferring that the hybrids have a lamellar structure composed of 2D siliceous domains separated by the alkylene chains. Assuming an average C-C distance of 0.13 nm, the addition of 3 CH2 groups to a nonylene chain would be expected to result in an increment of l equal to 0.39 nm, which is considerably higher (it corresponds grosso modo to a threefold increase) than the value found experimentally (4.24-4.09 = 0.15 nm). In the graph of Figure 2.2.9 (b) the experimental l spacings are compared with those calculated if the alkylene chains of the central and side spacers (S1 and S2, respectively) adopted exclusively fully extended all-trans zigzag conformations. The trend observed allows inferring that alltrans and gauche conformers coexist in the three samples. We may further conclude from Figure 2.2.9 (b) that there is not a linear relationship between the increase of the length of the central spacer Si of C10C9C10, C10C10C10 and C10C12C10 and the deviation of the experimental l values from those calculated for perfect all-trans alkylene chains (Al = 0.59, 0.68 and 0.83 nm for n = 9, 10 and 12, respectively). Therefore, it is clear that upon introduction of more methylene groups into the central spacer S1 the proportion of gauche conformers increases and the alkylene chains become less well packed, a process that ultimately leads to the compression of the siliceous layers. Based on these data it is reasonable to propose that the alkylene chains of the C10CnC10 samples with n\n= 9, 10 and 12 are very likely not perpendicularly oriented with respect to the 2D siliceous layers. To determine the average coherence length L of the lamellar order of the three hybrids examined by SAXS, the integral breadth of the second order diffraction peak observed in the SAXS patterns (B) was corrected from the instrumental broadening (b) by using a well crystallized poly(oxyethylene) [14] as standard reference of experimental aberrations. Assuming that the corrected integral breadth (B2 = B2-b2) [15] is essentially due to the size effects, the coherence length of the lamellar order, deduced by means of the Scherrer equation (L = 4%/0) [15], was 105+3 nm for C10C9C10 and 33+2 nm for samples with n = 10 and 12, respectively, corresponding to ca. 25\u00b11 and 8.0\u00b10.7 lamellae, respectively.\n. b\t\u2014\u25a0\u2014 Only al\\-trans conformations\t\n\t\u2014\u25a0\u2014 Experimental\t\t\t\t\n\t\u2014O\u2014 Deviation\t\n\u25a0\t\t\n-\tO\"\"\t\t-\n\u25a0\t\t\n\t\t_ \t,\n-\t\u25a0\u2014\t__\t\u25a0\u2014-\u2014'\t\n\u25a0\t\t\n9\t10\t11\t12\nn\nFigure 2.2.9. SAXS patterns of selected Ci0CnCi0 bridged silsesquioxanes (a), chain length dependence of the characteristic interlamellar distance l (left axis) and of the deviation of a complete all-irans conformations situation (b). The lines drawn in (b) are just guides for the eyes.\nIn spite of the conclusions retrieved from SAXS data, which suggest the presence of almost completely stretched chains, the absence of intramolecular cyclisation cannot be discarded. However, if present, it must be negligible and the result of a side reaction.\nValuable information regarding the conformational disorder of the alkylene chains may be retrieved from the intense, broad and ill-defined peak which dominates the 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra from 40 to 25 ppm (Figure 2.2.2). Two contributions at ca. 33 and 30 ppm are clearly discerned: the former resonance is due to the carbon atoms of ordered and densely packed alkylene chains in all-trans zigzag conformations, whereas the more shielded signal is produced by the carbon atoms of disordered chains adopting gauche conformations [16-18]. The shoulder visible at ca. 35 ppm (especially detected in the spectra of the C10C11C10 material (Figure 2.2.3 (b)) suggests that crystalline alkylene chains with different packing structures coexist in these samples [16]. Attempts to calculate the all-trans/gauche conformational ratio through curve-fitting of this broad, prominent peak were not successful and thus any conclusions drawn from these data were considered to be highly speculative. Comparison of the peak profile of the C10CnC10 materials studied suggests that the materials with even n appear to be more disordered than those with odd n, corroborating the conclusions drawn from SAXS data.\nTo gain complementary insight into the degree of chain packing and the trans/gauche conformational ratio in the C1oCnC1o hybrid samples we recorded the FT-IR and FT-Raman spectra and examined the following diagnostic modes of the alkylene chains: (1) The symmetric and asymmetric stretching CH2 modes (vsCH2 and vaCH2, respectively). (2) The CH2 bending (5CH2) mode.\nThe location and intensity of the vsCH2 mode is complicated due to Fermi resonance between the vsCH2 fundamental with the many overtones of the 5CH2 vibrations [18-22]. The vaCH2 mode is affected by coupling to the torsional and rotational motions of the chain [18-22]. In the Raman spectrum of ordered alkyl chains (all-trans conformations) the vaCH2 mode emerges as a strong band in the 2884-2878 cm-1 interval, whereas the vsCH2 mode produces bands at 2930 cm-1 (weak), 29002898 cm-1 (medium) and 2850-2844 cm-1 (strong) [18-22]. In the case of disordered alkylene chains (gauche conformations), the vaCH2 mode appears at 2897-2890 cm-1\nand the vsCH2 bands are typically seen at 2920 cm-1 (medium), 2904 cm-1 (medium) and 2858-2853 cm-1 (strong) [18, 21, 22]. Up- shifting and band broadening are indicative of an increasing proportion of gauche conformers.\nThe inspection of the 5CH2 region is of interest, since the frequency, intensity and band shape of the 5CH2 mode are sensitive to interchain interaction and to packing arrangement of the chains [15, 23]. Higher frequency (~1472 cm-1) in the IR spectra indicates ordering of the alkylene chains in all-trans conformations (crystalline state), whereas lower frequency (~1466 cm-1), band broadening and decreasing intensity indicate an increase in chain motion (liquid-like state) and therefore a larger gauche/trans conformer ratio [23].\nThe FT-Raman spectra of the C10CnC10 samples with even n and odd n in the vCH2 region, depicted in Figures 2.2.10 (a, b), respectively, are dominated by two bands at 2885 cm-1 (very strong, vS)/2857 cm-1 (strong, S) and 2884 cm-1 (vS)/2858 cm-1 (S), respectively. In both cases an intense event, manifested as a shoulder and located at 2850 and 2848 cm-1, respectively, is discerned (Figures 2.2.10 (a, b), respectively). The features at about 2885 and 2850 cm-1 are attributed to the vaCH2 and vsCH2 modes of all-trans conformers of the alkylene chains [19-23]. The component at ca. 2858 cm-1, also associated with the vsCH2 mode, is characteristic of gauche conformers [19, 22, 23]. The peak height ratio (r) of the vaCH2 and vsCH2 bands is a valuable tool to determine the conformational disorder of the alkylene chains and their packing arrangement [19]. High values (1.61-1.72) are produced by crystalline alkylene chains, whereas chains in the amorphous state give rise to values that range from 1.39 to 1.48 [19]. The dependence of the intensity ratio r = I2885/I28so with the number of carbon atoms of the alkylene chains of the central spacer S1 of the C10CnC10 materials is represented in Figure 2.2.11 The trend observed suggests that all the alkylene chains of the C10C7C10 sample (i.e., the chains of the side spacers S2 and that of the central spacer S1) are completely disordered and consequently adopt gauche conformations. It may be further inferred from the plot of Figure 2.2.11 that in hybrids with a longer central spacer S1 (n > 7) the proportion of fully stretched and densely packed alkylene chains (all-trans conformers) is enhanced considerably. In C10C9C10 the value attained for r practically coincides with the minimum value reported for solid n-alkanes, suggesting that the presence of two decylene side chains and one central nonylene chain promotes the highest degree of order and the tightest packing. In addition, these\ndata also point out that the samples with n = 10, 11 and 12 contain more gauche\nconformers than C10C9C10.\nWavenumber /cm'\nWavenumber / cm1\nFigure 2.2.10. FT-Raman spectra of the Ci0CnCi0 bridged silsesquioxanes with even n (a) and odd n (b) in the vCH2 region.\nFigure 2.2.11. Dependence of the ratio r (with r = 2885 cm-1/2850 cm-1) with the length of the\ncentral spacer S1 in the C10CnC10 bridged silsesquioxanes.\nThe bands centered at about 1479 and 1466 cm-1 in the 5CH2 region of the FT-IR spectra of the C10CnC10 hybrids (Figure 2.2.12) reveal the occurrence of ordered and disordered alkylene chains and thus the coexistence of all-trans and gauche conformers [23, 24]. The band at ca. 1440 cm-1 discerned in the same spectra represents a further evidence of the existence of gauche arrangements [25, 26]. Interestingly, it may be inferred from the comparison between Figures 2.2.12 (a, b) that the 5CH2 mode is sensitive to the parity of the number of carbon atoms of the alkylene chain of the central spacer. While the C10CnC10 hybrids with odd n display a shoulder at about 1460 cm-1 (Figure 2.2.12 (b)) such event is, however, absent in the case of the samples with even n (Figure 2.2.12 (a)). A similar effect was reported for the parent lamellar L8-L12 materials [3].\nWavenumber / cm-1\na\nWavenumber /cm1\nFigure 2.2.12. Room temperature FT-IR spectra of the Ci0CnCi0 bridged silsesquioxanes with even n (a) and odd n (b) in the 8CH2 region.\nThe FT-IR spectroscopic data were also employed to get insight into the extent and strength of hydrogen bonding in the C10CnC10 di-urea cross-linked BSs. This sort of information is fundamental to characterize this class of hybrids, since it has been\nextensively recognized [2,3, 27] that hydrogen bonding interactions between the urea groups play a key role, together with van der Waals interactions between the alkylene chains, in the self-assembly process and ultimately in the structuring of the materials. Recently, it was demonstrated that in L12 all the urea groups present are involved in the formation of an array of strong urea-urea hydrogen-bonded associations that extends throughout the material [5]. This is not surprising considering that urea groups are known to produce impressive self-assembly effects (e.g., excellent gelling properties [28, 29]). This unusual behavior is intimately associated with the particular geometry of the urea moiety. Indeed, the C=O group (hydrogen acceptor) of a urea group may form two hydrogen bonds with the pair of N-H groups (hydrogen donors) of a neighbor urea group, thus forming highly directional planar bifurcated hydrogen bonds [30]. For the reasons presented we decided to inspect the spectral signature of the C1oCnC1o silsesquioxanes in the \u201camide I\u201d (1700-1600 cm-1) and \u201camide II\u201d (16001500 cm-1) regions of the FT-IR spectra [31-33]. ]. Details concerning the \u201camide I\u201d and \u201camide II\u201d band can be found in section 2.1.\nThe \u201camide I\u201d band of L12 material had been previously decomposed into three components situated at 1668, 1645 and 1624 cm-1, assigned to the absorption of C=O groups included in ordered hydrogen-bonded urea-urea aggregates of increasing strength [5]. These aggregates will be henceforth designated as aggregates I, II and III, respectively.\nClose analysis of the \u201camide I\u201d and \u201camide II\u201d bands of the C10CnC10 hybrids (Figure 2.2.13) allowed us to conclude that curve-fitting was not straightforward, due to the breadth of the band envelopes and the presence of multiple overlapped components. This problem induced us to perform a 2D Correlation FT-IR spectroscopic analysis on the \u201camide I\u201d and \u201camide II\u201d bands of the C10CnC10 materials. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that such sort of approach has been applied to BS hybrids [34]. 2D Correlation spectroscopic data pointed out that the replacement of the side propylene chains by decylene chains deeply influenced the strength and extent of the urea-urea hydrogen-bonded array. New highly ordered hydrogen-bonded aggregates (so-called aggregates IV) located at 1609 cm-1, stronger than those found in L12 [5] (aggregates I, II and III) are formed. Moreover, in the C10CnC10 series no\naggregates II were detected [5]. The formation of aggregates IV occurs prior to that of aggregates III. Aggregates I are formed in last.\nWavenumber / cm\nFigure 2.2.13. FT-IR spectra of the C10CnC10 bridged silsesquioxanes in the 1750-1500 cm-1 region. The spectra were scaled so that the height of the vSi-O-Si band was approximately the\nsame. The wavenumbers indicated represent the intensity maxima of the band envelope of the\nC10C9C10 sample.\nIn an attempt to elucidate the relationship between the photoluminescence features and the length of the side spacers in alkylene-based BSs, we decided to examine the emission and excitation spectra of the Ci0CnCi0 materials.\nFigure 2.2.14 shows the emission spectra under UV excitation recorded for a selected sample, the amorphous C10C7C10 hybrid. The spectra are formed of a large Gaussian-shaped broad band between 320 and 520 nm. Increasing the excitation wavelength from 280 to 320 nm induces an increase in the relative intensity of the high wavelength side of the spectra. The emission features are almost independent of the length of the central alkylene spacer S1 (n = 7, 9-12) (Figure 2.2.15). Interestingly, these spectra are very similar to those reported for the P12-derived A12 [6] hybrid (inset of Figure 2.2.15), despite, not only the longer side spacers S2 of C10CnC10 BS, but also the different synthetic conditions used. Similar emission features were also observed and extensively detailed for amorphous analogous hybrids incorporating\npropylene-based side spacers, such as the di-ureasils [35-36], the di-urethanesils [37], and the mono- [38] and di-[39] amidosils, being ascribed to the overlap of two distinct emissions mediated by donor-acceptor pair transitions that occur within the urea, urethane or amide cross-linkages, respectively, and within the siliceous skeleton, due to the presence of oxygen-related defects [35-36].\nWavelength I nm\nFigure 2.2.14.

Room-temperature emission spectra of the C10CnC10 bridged silsesquioxanes excited at 280 nm. The inset shows the emission spectra of A12 hybrid excited at 280 nm [16].\nThese two emission components were clearly identified through time-resolved spectroscopy. Figure 2.2.16 shows the emission spectra of C10C11C10 acquired for distinct starting delay (SD) values under 365 nm excitation wavelength. For SD values smaller than 5.00 ms, the spectra unambiguously display two bands around 427 nm (marked with an arrow in Figure 2.2.16) and 500 nm, previously ascribed to electronhole recombination occurring in the siliceous domains and in the urea cross-linkages, respectively [35-36].\nAt higher SD values, only the long-lived urea-related component could be observed. In order to detail the time-scale behind each component, lifetime measurements were performed by monitoring the emission decay curves at 427 and 500 nm.\nWavelength / nm\nFigure 2.2.16. (a) Low-temperature (10 K) time-resolved emission spectra of the Ci0CnCi0 bridged silsesquioxane excited at 365 nm acquired under different starting delay values: (1) 0.05 ms, (2) 1.00 ms, (3) 5.00 ms and (4) 20.00 ms. The integration window was 20.00 ms. Emission decay curves monitored at (b) 427 nm and (c) 505 nm excited at 365 nm; the solid lines represent the data best fit using a single exponential function.\nBoth decay curves are modeled by a single exponential function yielding lifetime values of 3.4\u00b10.2 ms and 42.7\u00b14.0 ms for the siliceous and urea-related components, respectively. While the lifetime value of the siliceous-related component resembles\nthat acquired for the di-ureasils, the urea-related lifetime value is substantially smaller (3.5\u00b10.2 ms and 160.0\u00b18.0 ms, respectively [35]). Energy transfer between these two distinct emitting centers was quantitatively estimated for the di-ureasil host with the smallest number of polymer repeat units (d-U(600)) yielding rate values of 1.3x109 s-1 (dipole-dipole mechanism) and 3.7x108 s-1 (exchange process) [40]. As these energy transfer rates strongly depend on the distance between the two emitting centers, the similar lifetimes of the siliceous-related component in the long-chain analogue d-U(2000) and C10C11C10 suggest a similar average distance between the siliceous domains and the urea cross-links, indicating that the side spacers in C10C11C10 most probably adopt gauche conformations. Furthermore, the fourfold increase of the radiative transition decay rate (inverse of the lifetime at 10 K) in C10C11C10, relatively to d-U(2000), is probably associated to the increasing of vibronic-spin-orbit interaction, [40] due to a distinct distribution of hydrogen bonds induced by the increase of the length of the side spacers. The latter result proves that the emission features of the urea-related component of di-urea-cross-linked BSs are sensitive to the length of the side spacers (we recall that there are only three methylene groups in the side spacers of the di-ureasils versus ten methylene groups in those of the C10CnC10 hybrids).\nThe typical excitation spectra monitored within the emission band in Figure 2.2.14 shows a broad band peaking at 280 nm, whose peak position and full-width-at-half-maximum (fwhm) deviates towards the red as the monitoring wavelength increases (inset in Figure 2.2.14). Similarly to the situation found for the emission data, these excitation spectra are identical to those monitored for the A12 [6] hybrid. The high- and low-energy side were attributed to the preferential excitation of the siliceous- and urea-related emission [35-36]. Apart from an increase in the relative intensity of the high- wavelength side of the emission spectra those acquired at 12 K (Figure 2.2.17) resemble those measured at room-temperature (Figure 2.2.14).\nThe absolute emission quantum yield was acquired under the excitation wavelength that maximises the emission features (i.e., 280 nm). For higher excitation wavelengths (330-350 nm) the quantum yield values are below 0.01. The quantum yield values are poorly affected by changes in the alkylene chains length being 0.07\u00b10.01 and 0.06\u00b10.01 for the C10CnC10 samples with n = 7 and 11, respectively. These are considerably smaller than those reported for the P12-derived hybrids,\nnamely the lamellar L12 and for the amorphous A12 with quantum yield values of 0.14\u00b10.01 [5] and 0.24+0.02 [6], respectively, both excited at 290 nm, the latter being the maximum value measured for this type of materials. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the photoluminescence measurements and the quantum yield values of A12 are time-dependent. Upon aging at ambient atmosphere the quantum yield value decreased approximately 2.5 times. The photoluminescence data and quantum yield values reported here for the C10CnC10 BSs do not show any variation in the same period of time. We should also emphasize that the above mentioned quantum yield values resemble the maximum values measured for di-ureasil hybrids (0.07-0.09\u00b10.01) under longer excitation wavelengths (360-400 nm) [35].\nFigure 2.2.17. Low-temperature (12 K) emission spectra of the C10C11C10 bridged silsesquioxane excited between 280 and 360 nm.\n2.2.4.\tConclusions\nIn this section, a novel series of hybrids, represented by the notation C10CnC10, were prepared from silsesquioxane precursors including decylene chains as side spacers and alkylene chains containing 7, 9, 10, 11 or 12 methylene groups as central spacer. The main goal of the present study was to evaluate the influence of the length of the side spacers on the morphology and structure of alkylene-based BS hybrid materials.\nThe SEM images provided evidence that the morphology the C10CnC10 samples, ranging from irregular micro-objects to dense spheroidal microparticles,\nclearly differs from the platelet-like morphology of the L8-12 samples [1-8], but resembles closely that of the L12D material [section 2.1]. In particular, the characteristic L12D microsphere-like morphology mimicking sea sponges, in which thin folded films assemble along an edge-to face fashion, was especially recognized in C10C9C10. Taking into account that the same synthetic procedure (HCl-catalyzed hydrolytic route in the presence of a large volume of DMSO) was employed to produce L12D and the C10CnC10 hybrids, we believe that the morphological similarity found is a consequence of solvent polarity effects [section 2.1].\nThe lamellar structure of all the C10CnC10 samples investigated was evidenced by XRD and SAXS. The lamellae are arranged along a structure composed of 2D siliceous domains separated by non perpendicularly oriented alkylene chains containing variable amounts of trans and gauche conformers. SAXS, 13C CP/MAS NMR, FT-IR and FT-Raman spectroscopic data demonstrated that, while the alkylene chains of the side and central spacers of C10C7C10 are completely disordered, in samples with a longer central spacer S1 the proportion of fully stretched and densely packed alkylene chains (all-trans conformers) is enhanced significantly. The highest degree of order and tightest packing are attained for n =\n9.\tThis structuring trend contrasts markedly with that observed in the case of the Ln family [6] for which the degree of order increases with the increase of the number of methylene groups in the central spacer, provided that at least 8 methylene groups are present in the alkylene chains.\nThe emission spectra of selected C10CnC10 samples are practically independent of the length of the central alkylene spacer and similar to those reported for hybrid materials containing propylene side spacers, such as the non-structured BS A12 [6], the di-ureasils [35,36], the di-urethanesils [37] and the di-amidosils [39] and the structured lamellar bilayer mono-amidosils [38]. The emission is ascribed to the overlap of two distinct components that occur within the urea, urethane and amide cross-linkages in the case of the di-ureasils, di-urethanesils, and amidosils, respectively, and within the siliceous nanodomains. Time-resolved spectroscopic data has enabled us to demonstrate for the first time that the emission features of the urea-related component of the emission of di-urea cross-linked BSs depend critically on the length of the alkylene-based side spacers. It also allowed us inferring that the\naverage distance between the siliceous regions and the urea cross-links is practically the same in BSs including propylene- and decylene-based side chains, suggesting that the longer chains adopt gauche conformations.\nThe excitation spectra of the Ci0CnCi0 hybrids resemble that of A12 [6]. However, while the lifetime value of the siliceous-related component resembles that acquired for the di-ureasils, the urea-related lifetime value is substantially smaller, providing evidence of the crucial role played by the longer side spacers on the dynamics of the two distinct emissions.\nThe absolute emission quantum yield of C10C11C10 is considerably smaller than the highest value reported for the P12-derived materials (A12), but, unlike the latter BS, it is time-independent.\n2.2.5.\tReferences\n1.\tJ.

In this white light emitter self-assembly is dictated by: (i) intermolecular hydrogen bonding between amide groups; (ii) van der Waals interactions between all-trans alkyl chains assuming a partially interdigitated packing mode; (iii) entropic term related to the phase separation between the alkyl chains and the siloxane nanodomains. These factors determine the emergence of a thermally-actuated photoluminescence memory effect, induced by the reversible order-disorder phase transition of the alkyl chains.\nIn sections 2.1 and 2.2 we demonstrated that the chemical structure of the bridged organosilane precursors (namely the length of the central and side spacers) and the choice of the experimental conditions (namely, water content, type of catalyst and nature of the solvents) determine the final structure and morphology of BS materials were emphasized.\nIn the present section we pursued our general investigation on the structuring of silsesquioxanes through the study of materials derived from organosilanes carrying pendant alkyl chains, thus structurally similar to the mono-amidosils [1]. The main goal of this work was to evaluate the consequences arising from the replacement of the amidosil linkage by the urethane linkage. In addition, we wanted to examine the influence of the chain length on the physical-chemical properties of these materials which were named mono-alkyl-urethanesils.\nTo prepare this new family of silsesquioxanes we used as organic precursors three fatty alcohols (CYOH) (also called alkanols) of variable length. These compounds\nare suitable because the reaction of the terminal OH group with the isocyanate group of ICPTES gives rise to the urethane linkage.\nThe notations used to represent the mono-alkyl urethanesils were m-Ut(CY)-ac and m-Ut(CY)@ax. In both notations m stands for mono, Ut denotes urethanesil and Y corresponds to number of carbon atoms in the pendant alkyl chain of the alcohol precursor. In the former notation ac indicates that an acid catalyst was employed; in the latter notation @ax represents a set of three samples in which the effect of solvent was analyzed, x being the experience number.\n2.3.2.\tExperimental part\nMaterials\n1-Tetradecanol (C14OH, Aldrich, 97%, 214,39 g/mol), 1-hexadecanol (C16OH, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%, 242,45 g/mol), 1-docasanol (C22OH, Aldrich, 98%, 326,61 g/mol), (3-isocyanatopropyl)triethoxysilane (ICPTES, Fluka, 95%), hydrochloric acid (HCl, Panreac) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), Merck, GC purity) were used as received. Ethanol (CH3CH2OH, Merck, PA grade) and tetrahydrofuran (THF, Merck, puriss. PA grade) were stored over molecular sieves. High purity distilled water was used in all experiments.\nSynthesis and characterization\nSynthesis of the m-UtPTES(Y) mono-alkyl-urethanesil precursors\nTo synthesize the mono-urethanepropyltriethoxysilane precursors, ICPTES was added to a solution (with the appropriate solvent) of fatty alcohol CYOH. The reaction was carried out at 60-70 \u00b0C under stirring, for several hours (Scheme 2.3.1). The progress of the reaction was monitored by infrared spectroscopy: the strong vibration due to the isocyanate group of ICPTES at 2274 cm-1 decrease progressively, until it disappeared upon completion of the reaction. Simultaneously, a series of new bands, associated with the vibrations of the urethane group, grew in the 1800-1500 cm-1 region. Their structure was confirmed by means of 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) and 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCls).\n86\t| Hybrids organic-Inorganic materials obtained by sol-gel and self-assembly techniques\nC(14) 3H NMR (400 MHz, CDCI3) 5 (ppm): 0.58-0.65 (m, 2H), 0.87 (t, J = 6,7 Hz, 3H),\n1.18-\t1.37 (m, 31H), 1.50-1.67 (m, 4H), 3.10-3.20 (m, 2H), 3.80 (q, J = 7.0 Hz, 6H), 4.01 (t, J = 6,7 Hz, 2H), 4,90 (br, 1H); 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCI3) 5 (ppm): 7.6, 14.1, 18.2,\n22.6,\t23.3, 25.8, 29.29, 29.32, 29.4, 29.5, 29.57, 29.59, 29.62, 29.64, 29.7, 31.9, 43.1,\n58.4,\t64.8, 156.8.\nC(16) 3H NMR (400 MHz, CDCI3) 5 (ppm): 0,59-0,63 (m, 2H), 0,86 (t, J = 6,8 Hz, 3H), 1,15-1,35 (m, 35H), 1,53-1,63 (m, 4H), 3,15-3,18 (m, 2H), 3,80 (q, J = 7,1 Hz, 6H), 4.00 (t, J = 6,6 Hz, 2H), 4.90 (br, 1H); 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCI3) 5 (ppm): 7.7, 14.2, 18.4, 22.8, 23.4, 26.0, 29.3, 29.4, 29.5, 29-7-29.8 (8 C), 32.0, 43.4, 58.5, 65.0, 156.9.\nC(22) 3H NMR (400 MHz, CDCI3) 5 (ppm): 0.58-0.65 (m, 2H), 0.87 (t, J = 6,8 Hz, 3H),\n1.19-\t1.35 (m, 47H), 1.51-1.65 (m, 4H), 3.10-3.20 (m, 2H), 3.81 (q, J = 7.0 Hz, 6H); 4.01 (t, J = 6,6 Hz, 2H), 4.88 (br, 1H); 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCI3) 5 (ppm): 7.6, 14.1, 18.2,\n22.7,\t23.3, 25.9, 29.0, 29.30, 29.33, 29.5, 29.58, 29.64, 29.7-29.8 (11 C), 31.9, 43.3,\n58.4,\t64.8, 156,8.\nSynthesis of mono-alkyl-urethanesils via the acid-catalyzed hydrolytic route (m-Ut(CY)-ac).\nAn aqueous soIution of HCI was added to the m-UtPTES(Y) precursor (moIar ratio m-UtPTES(Y):H2O:HCI = 1:600:0.2) (TabIe 2.3.1).

SampIes @ai, @a2 and @a3 were prepared to observe the influence of DMSO (moIar ratio CYOH: H2O: DMSO = 1: 300: 300).

Masses of approximately 15 mg were placed in 30 pL aluminium cans and stored in a dessicator over P2O5 for one week at room temperature under vacuum. After this pretreatment the cans were hermetically sealed and the thermograms were recorded. Each sample was heated at different scanning rates, according to its characteristics. The purge gas used was high purity N2 supplied at a constant 35 cm3 min-1 flow rate.\nAttenuated Total Reflectance (ATR): The spectra recorded as function of temperature were obtained with a SPECAC temperature controller in a ATR configuration using a High Temperature Golden Gate\u2122 MkII ATR Accessory. The spectra were collected in 4000-500 cm-1 range by averaging 64-200 scans and a resolution of 1 cm-1. The range of temperatures studied was chosen for each sample according to the phase transitions observed in DSC experiments.\nPolarized Optical Microscopy (POM): POM images were recorded using an OPTIKA B-600POL microscope equipped with a 8 Mpixel Digital Photo Camera. The images were analyzed using the OPTIKA Vision Pro software. The same apparatus and procedure was described in the section 1 of this chapter.\nScanning Electron Microscopy (SEM): SEM micrographs were obtained using a SEM/ESEM-FEI Quanta 400 scanning electron microscope at high acceleration voltage (20 kV). A small portion of the sample was fixed on an aluminium stub with carbon tape and then coated with Au/Pd.\nHigh Resolution Scanning Electron Microscopy (HR-SEM): The m-Ut(CY)-ac samples were analyzed in a HITACHI S-5500 microscope operating at 30 kV. The samples were dispersed in ethanol and transferred to a grid. The m-Ut(C16)@ax samples were analyzed with a FEI Quanta 400 FEG ESEM/ EDAXS PEGASUS x 4M. The samples were transferred to a carbon tape and coated with Au/Pd.\nPhotoluminescence (PL): The emission and excitation spectra and the absolute emission quantum yelds were obtained at room temperature in the same equipement and conditions as described earlier in section 2.2.\n2.3.3.\tResults and discussion\nFigures 2.3.1 (a) and (b) show the 29Si CP/MAS NMR spectra of the samples under study. All the samples produce three peaks centered at -47 (T1), -57 (T2) and -67 (T3) and no T0 environments. The absence of Q-type Si atoms demonstrates the total preservation of the Si-C covalent bonds. The T1 signal can be distinguished for the sample @a2 (Figure 2.3.1 and Table 2.3.2). The spectrum of sample @a3 is dominated by the T3 environment (Figure 2.3.1 and Table 2.3.2).\nThe relative population of the various Si sites in the samples was estimated quantitatively through curve-fitting of the 29Si CP/MAS spectra and was used to determine the condensation degrees (c) using the expression (c= 1/3(%T1 +2%T2 + 3%T3)). The values obtained are given in Table 2.3.2.\n3\n2\n1\nFigure 2.3.1. 29 Si CP/MAS NMR spectra of the m-Ut(CY)-ac (a) and m-Ut(C16)@aX m (b) monoalkyl urethanesils.\nThe c values calculated for the m-Ut(CY)-ac samples and for m-Ut(C16)@a3 are of the same order of magnitude than those reported earlier for di--urethanesil systems [2, 3]. In contrast, the values deduced for m-Ut(C16)@ai and m-Ut(C16)@a2 practically coincide with that of the mono-amidosil m-A(14) [1]. The dominating T2 site in both these samples suggests the formation of a 2D siloxane network. In the case of m-Ut(C16)@a3 the prominent T3 signal indicates that the condensation process favored branched structures instead.\nFrom the 13 C/CP MAS NMR spectra, it is clear that no cleavage of the urethane groups, Si-C, or O-alkyl bonds occurred during the synthesis. Indeed, the preservation of the urethane cross-links in the final materials is evidenced by the signal at 160 ppm (Figure 2.3.2 and Table 2.3.3). The peaks associated with the propylene chains are centred at about 44, 24 and 10 ppm (Table 2.3.3 and Figure 2.3.2). The signal observed at 64 ppm, attributed to the O-CH2 methylene group, corresponds to that found around 65 ppm in the solution 13C NMR spectrum of the precursors. The peak at 14 ppm is attributed to the terminal CH3 of the alkyl chain.\nSample\ty\tx\tT1\tT2\tT3\tc\tEmpirical formula\nm-Ut(Cy)_ac\t14\t\t3.2\t56.0\t41.0\t78\tCH3(CH2)13-O-C(=O)-NH-(CH2)3-Si(OH)0.60O1.2\n\t16\t\t2.5\t55.3\t42.1\t80\tCH3(CH2)15-O-C(=O)-NH-(CH2)3-Si(OH)0.60O1.2\n\t22\t\t3.0\t58.0\t38.0\t79\tCH3(CH2)21-O-C( = O)-NH-(CH2) 3-Si(OH)0.64O1.18\nm-Ut(C16)@ax\t\t1\t5.5\t70.6\t23.9\t73\tCH3(CH2)15-O-C(=O)-NH-(CH2)3-Si(OH)0.81O1.09\n\t\t2\t10.6\t48.4\t40.9\t76\tCH3(CH2)15-O-C(=O)-NH-(CH2)3-Si(OH)0.69O1.15\n\t\t3\t3.2\t39.9\t56.8\t84\tCH3(CH2)15-O-C(=O)-NH-(CH2)3-Si(OH)0.46O1.27\nTable 2.3.3. 13C CP/MAS data (8 in ppm) of the m-Ut(Y)-ac and m-Ut(C16)@ax mono-alkyl urethanesils\nY = 14\tm-Ut(CY)-ac Y = 16\tSample\t\tm-Ut(C16)@ax x = 2\tx = 3\tAttribution\n\t\tY = 22\tx = 1\t\t\t\n156\t157\t157\t157\t157\t159\tC=O groups\n64\t65\t64\t64\t65\t62\tnon-assigned\n\t\t\t\t62\t\tnon-assigned\n44\t44\t43\t-\t-\t-\tCH2NHC(=O)OCH2\n33\t33\t33\t33\t33\t34\t(CH2)n all trans\n30\t-\t-\t-\t30\t30\t(CH2)n gauche\n27\t27\t28\t28\t27\t27\tCH2NHCOCH2\n24\t24\t24\t24\t24\t24\tSiCH2CH2CH2NHCO\n14\t14\t14\t14\t14\t14\tCH3(CH2)n\n10\t11\t11\t10\t10\t10\tSiCH2CH2CH2NHCO\n92\tHybrids organic-Inorganic materials obtained by sol-gel and self-assembly techniques\n(a)\n(b)\n2\n14\nFigure 2.3.2. 13 C CP/MAS NMR spectra of the m-Ut(CY)-ac (a) and m-Ut(C16)@aX m (b) monoalkyl urethanesils.\nAs previously discussed in sections 2.1 and 2.2, the 30.0-35.0 ppm region provides valuable information concerning the conformational disorder of the methylene groups. Densely packed all-trans chains produce a peak centred at 34.0 ppm, whereas the amorphous regions, characterized by gauche conformations, yield a more shielded peak (30.0 ppm).\nFor samples with m-Ut(CY)-ac the resonance peak is centred at 33.0 ppm indicating more ordered structures (Figure 2.3.3 (a)). This general trend is also observed for m-Ut(CY)@a1 and m-Ut(CY)@a2 (Figure 2.3.3 (b)). Samples with m-Ut(C14)-ac (Figure 2.3.3 (a)) and m-Ut(CY)@a2 (Figure 2.3.3 (b)) also produce a shoulder at 30 ppm, indicative of the presence of more disordered conformations. The m-Ut(CY)@a3 sample yields a considerably better resolved profile than all the other materials. The main resonances are located at 32.8 and 32.5 ppm a well-defined peak is seen at 34 ppm and a shoulder is also detected at 30 ppm (Figure 2.3.3 (b)).\n(b)\n32.5\nx\n3\n2\n1\nFigure 2.3.3. 13 C CP/MAS NMR of the m-Ut(CY)-ac (a) and m-Ut(CY)@ax (b) mono-alkyl urethanesil samples in the 24-30 ppm region.\nFurther evidence of the conformational degree of disorder of the pendant alkyl chains can be retrieved from FT-IR spectroscopic data in the vCH2 and 5CH2 regions (Figure 2.3.4). The importance of these two FT-IR regions was emphasized in section\n2.2\nThe position of the vCH2 modes indicates the presence of a high concentration of alkyl chains in all-trans conformations because of the close correspondence of the frequencies with those reported for highly crystalline n-alkanes (Figure 2.3.4 (A)). The signature of the vCH2 bands at room temperature and at variable temperature will be discussed in detail below in this section in the framework of the discussion of the order/disorder phase transition undergone by these materials.\nThe CH2 bending (5CH2) mode is sensitive to the interchain interaction and the packing arrangement of the chains [4]. Higher frequencies (~1472 cm-1) indicate ordering of the methylene chains in all trans crystalline state\nThe absorption around 1470 cm-1 in Figure 2.3.4 (B) is characteristic of a partially ordered phase where the chains are mobile while maintaining some orientational order. The six samples examined exhibit this band confirming the conclusion obtained from 13 C CP/MAS NMR data. In the case of the m-Ut(CY)@a3 sample the peak is split in two bands: one at 1468 cm-1 and another one at 1464 cm-1, corresponding to ordered alkyl chains in two sorts of environments. In sections 2.1 and 2.2 the \u201camide I\u201d region was related to urea groups. In the present chapter the \u201camide I\u201d region will be associated with urethane groups.\nFigure 2.3.5 reproduces the global profile of the \u201camide I\u201d and \u201camide II\u201d regions. The band envelopes are similar for all the samples except m-Ut(CY)@a3. In the FT-IR spectrum of the latter material a strong component is also visible at 1650 cm-1.\nThe event located at 1750 cm-1 is ascribed to the \u201cfree\u201d urethane linkages (urethane linkage whose N-H and C=O groups remain non-bonded) [5]. The components at 1720 and 1705 cm-1 correspond to the absorption of hydrogen bonded C=O groups in disordered urethane-urethane aggregates [5]. The bands mentioned emerge in both groups of materials (Figure 2.3.5). In the case of the m-Ut(CY)-ac samples the bands located at 1690, 1673 and 1657 cm-1 correspond to the stronger urethane-urethane aggregates. For the m-Ut(C16)@ax samples the stronger urethaneurethane aggregates give rise to bands at 1686 and 1663 cm-1. The new component present in the \u201camide I\u201d band of m-Ut(C16)@a3 at 1633 cm-1 may be ascribed to the formation of even stronger urethane-urethane aggregates.\nWavenumber (cm1)\nWavenumber (cm1)\nB\nFigure 2.3.4.

The XRD pattern of m-Ut(C22)-ac is, however, significantIy better resoIved: the peak observed at 14.0 nm-1 (d = 0.45 nm), corresponds to urethane-urethane distances [6, 7], whereas that at 16.0 nm-1 (d = 0.39 nm) and the shouIder at ca. 17.0 nm-1 (d = 0.37 nm) are associated with in-pIane chainchain ordering distances [8]. The former peak is reIated with chains in gauche conformations and the Iatter to chains in aII-trans conformations (highIy packed and thus cIoser) [8]. The peak expected at about 15 nm-1, attributed to order within the siIiceous domains, is probabIy masked by the 14 and 16 nm-1 peaks [8].\nComparison of the high q range XRD patterns of the m-Ut(CY)-ac and m-Ut(C16)@ax mono-aIkyI-urethanesiIs aIIows to immediateIy concIude that the Iatter patterns are considerabIy better resoIved (Figure 2.3.7.). The band contour of sampIes m-Ut(C16)@a1 and m-Ut(C16)@a2 resembIes cIoseIy (Figure 2.3.7): whiIe the peak corresponding to the urethane-urethane Iinkage is Iocated at 14.2 nm-1 (0.44 nm), that due to the order within the siIiceous domains is is found at 15.1 nm-1 (d = 0.41 nm) and\n15.3\tnm-1 (d = 0.41 nm), respectiveIy. The iII-defined component detected at ca. 17.1 nm-1 (d = 0.37 nm) is very IikeIy associated with in-pIane chain-chain ordering distances concerning highIy packed aII-trans conformers [8]. SampIe m-Ut(C16)@a3 differs markedIy from the other materiaIs. Its XRD pattern in the high q range is composed of a series of sharp and narrow peaks (Figure 2.3.7), which suggest that this materiaI has higher order at shorter range. The attribution of these Bragg peaks, compIeteIy different from those reported in other ordered siIsesquioxanes in under study.\n1,0\nq (nm-1)\nq (nm-1)\nq (\u2122-1)\nFigure 2.3.8. XRD patterns of the m-Ut(CY)-ac (a) and m-Ut(C16)@ax (b) mono-akyl urethanesils in the low q region. In the case of the m-Ut(CY)-ac samples the SAXS patterns are also included (red line, right yy' axis).\nThe XRD patterns represented in Figure 2.3.8 show a series of peaks which correspond to the kth order reflections of a lamellar structure. The 1st peak detected represents the fundamental order of a lamellar bilayer structure with an interlamellar spacing l (where l = k2x/qk). The lexp values deduced for the m-Ut(C16)@ax samples (Table 2.3.4)\nwere based on the XRD patterns. In the case of the m-Ut(CY)-ac samples the lexp values were estimated (Table 2.3.4) using the position of the 1st peak of the SAXS spectra (red curves in Figure 2.3.8). Assuming an average distance of 0.15 nm for the C-C, C-N, N-C=O, and C=O bonds [9] we estimated the theoretical interlamellar distance (/theor) for all the samples (Table 2.3.4). Comparison of these experimental and calculated values allowed us to conclude that the three m-Ut(CY)-ac samples and m-Ut(C16)@ai and m-Ut(C16)@a2 incorporate partially interpenetrated alkyl chains. Therefore, the interlamellar distance l represents the separation between the siliceous domains of a lamellar bilayer structure governed by the length of the interdigitated alkyl chains. The complex XRD pattern of m-Ut(C16)@a3 requires an in-depth analysis. A preliminary examination of these data suggests the coexistence of two lamellar structures in this material (Figure 2.3.8). Based on the XRD data, a tentative representation of m-Ut(C16)-ac has been derived (Scheme 2.3.2 ).\nTable 2.3.4.

The samples are essentially anhydrous. The loss of water observed at Y = 14 it corresponds to 1.5%. Between 250 and 500 \u00b0C all the materials undergo an abrupt weight loss of ca. 75%. Beyond 500 \u00b0C a plateau is reached, which probably corresponds to a SiO2 residue.\nFigure 2.3.9. TGA curves of the m-Ut(CY)-ac mono-alkyl urethanesil. The derivative curve is shown in red.\nFigure 2.3.10 (A) shows the DSC traces of the starting alcohols (1-tetradecanol, 1-hexadecanol and 1- docasonal). In Figure 2.3.10 (B) the DSC curves of the m-Ut(CY)-ac samples are represented. As referred in the literature [10] the starting materials present very important endothermic transitions (Figure 2.3.10 (a-c)). In the present work we recorded the DSC curves primarily to: (1) Confirm the occurrence of order/disorder transitions; (2) Check if, as we expected, the presence of the urethane linkage modified the order/disorder phase transition temperature with respect to that reported for the parent mono-amidosil material [1].\nAs expected the thermograms of 1-tetradecanol, 1-hexadecanol and 1-docosanol exhibit a single endothermic peak (Figure 2.3.10 (a-c)). The corresponding temperatures (onset and peak maxima) are listed in Table 2.3.5. The m-Ut(CY)-ac samples also give rise to an endothermic peak with onset temperatures, which are, as expected, different from those of the corresponding starting alcohols (Figure 2.3.10 and Table 2.3.5). In the case of m-Ut(CY)-ac the DSC trace exhibits two endotherms (Figure 2.3.10 and Table 2.3.5). The endothermic peaks are tentatively attributed to order-disorder phase transition[1].\nComparison of the phase transition onset temperature of the mono-alkyl urethanesils reported in Table 2.3.5 with the temperature transition observed for the parent mono-amidosil compound (which inspired this work) led us to conclude that all the mono-alkyl urethanesil compounds have lower values than m-A(14), as required [1].\nTable 2.3.5.

DSC curves of (A) the starting alcohols (1-tetradecanol (a), 1-hexadecanol (b) and 1- docosanol (c)) and (B) of the m-Ut(CY)-ac mono-alkyl urethanesils.\nThe temperature dependence of the FT-IR spectra of m-Ut(C16)-ac and the 1-hexadecanol precursor was analyzed in order to check the influence of the temperature on the conformational disorder of the alkyl chains. As indicated in section\n2.2,\tthe conformation of the alkyl chains may be inferred from the position of the vCH2 bands.\nThe FT-IR spectra in an ATR configuration were recorded during the heating and cooling cycles for m-UtC(16)-ac, from room temperature up to a temperature between the transition temperature and the decomposition temperature. Figure 2.3.11 (a) represents the ATR spectra as a function of temperature.\nAt room temperature the vaCH2 band is located at 2916 cm-1, a wavenumber characteristic of the vaCH2 n-alkanes in all-trans conformations [4, 11]. During the heating cycle, in particular when the temperature reaches the onset of the order/disorder transition temperature of m-Ut(C16)-ac (68 \u00b0C), the band shifts to higher wavenumbers (2924 cm-1) (Figure 2.3.11 (a)) [4, 11]. Upon increasing progressively the temperature, the proportion of alkyl chains in gauche conformations increases. During cooling the alkyl chains recover their original conformational state and the wavenumber of the vaCH2 band recovers its original value (2916 cm-1). Figure 2.3.11 (b) shows that the behavior of the vaCH2 band of m-Ut(C16)-ac during the cooling cycle exhibits hysteresis, as already reported for m-A(14). However, in the present case, unlike in m-A(14), the phenomenon is also reversible, although apparently time-independent.\nFor comparative purposes, the same spectroscopic type of measurements were performed with the starting precursor, i.e., 1-hexadecanol (Figure 2.3.11 (c)). The shift from 2916 to 2921 cm-1 occurs abruptly, in a single step when the transition temperature of this compound is reached. The same behavior was observed for 1-tetradecanol [10].\nFigure 2.3.11. Temperature dependence of the ATR spectra (a) and the vaCH2 band (b) of the m-Ut(C16)-ac mono-aIkyI urethanesiI. For comparative purposes the vaCH2 band shifts corresponding to 1-hexadecanoI are presented in (c) (bIack symboIs - heating cycIe; open symboIs - cooIing cycIe). The DSC curves for m-Ut(C16)-ac (a) and 1-hexadecanoI (b) are aIso represented.\nIt was of the utmost interest to examine the two series of mono-alkyl urethanesil from the standpoint of morphology. The POM images reproduced in Figure 2.3.12 demonstrate that the selected samples exhibit birrefringence under crossed polarizers\nFigure 2.3.12. POM images obtained under cross polarizers for representative mono-alkyl urethanesils: m-Ut(C14)-ac (a) and m-Ut(C16)@ai.(b).\nThe SEM images obtained for the m-Ut(CY)-ac materials show that this class of silsesquioxanes display complex and intrincate morphologies (Figure 2.3.13). m-Ut(C14)-ac exhibits an irregular texture composed of micrometric \u201ccabbage-type leaves\" (Figures 2.3.13 (a) and (b)). This samples' lamellar nature is clearly evident in the HR-SEM image of Figure 2.3.13 (c). Curiously, the texture of m-Ut(C16)-ac mimics the very tight arrangement of \u201c\u201ccabbage-type leaves\u201d (Figure 2.3.13 (e)). The stacking of the lamellae is perfectly evident by HR-SEM (Figure 2.3.13 (g)) and AFM (Figure 2.3.13 (g)). The morphology of m-Ut(C22)-ac is also quite interesting, with plates organized in a such a way that globally a flower-like texture that mimics the \u201cdesert rose\u201d-like arrangement results (Figures 2.3.13 (h) and (i)). HR-SEM and AFM confirm the lamellar nanostructure of this material (Figure 2.3.13 (j)).\nThe morphologies exhibited by the m-Ut(C16)@ax materials (Figure 2.3.14) are completely different from those found in the m-Ut(y)-ac mono-alkyl urethanesils (Figure 2.3.13). All the m-Ut(C16)@ax samples are composed of randomly organized microplates. Their thickness increases, however, significantly with X (Figure 2.3.14 (c),\n(f)\tand (i)). It is noteworthy that in m-Ut(C16)@ax some of the plates (ca. 2-3 mm thick and 20 mm long) adopt a hexagonal shape. The edge-to-face growth gives rise to a unique \u201corigami\u201d-like morphology.\n\n(d)\n-section\nC16_Ac_cross-section\n10-May-10 HV WD j Mag I Spot I \u00a11:57:25PM|30.0kV;10.0mm!e0Q0x| 3.5 |\n28-Ape-10 HV I WD plag\u00a1SpotL\n4 55 28PM 200kV!99mm 1200x 4 0 |\nS5500 30 OkV x6O0k SE\n10-May-10| HV I WD | Mag Spot O 01 40 PM I on n Irvl Q a mm|l2000x| 3.0\nS5500 30.0kVx180k SE\nFigure 2.3.13.

The origin of the bands is attributed to the overlap of two distinct emissions mediated by donor-acceptor pair recombinations that occur within the urethane linkages and within oxygen related defects [12, 13]. The typical excitation spectra monitored within the emission band present in Figure 2.3.15 (b, d, f) for the m-Ut(C14)-ac, m-Ut(C16)-ac and m-Ut(C22)-ac show a broad band peaking at 310 nm, 340, 350 nm respectively. The peak position deviates towards the red as the monitoring wavelength increases. The absolute emission quantum yield was acquired for excitation wavelengths between 330 and 400 nm. The values obtained are presented in Table 2.3.6. The maximum quantum yield values id 0.11\u00b10.01 for all the samples under study and are poorly affected by changes in the alkyl chain length. In all the samples the maximum value is obtained at 360 nm.\nTable 2.3.6.

These compounds were designated as mono-alkyl urethanesils (m-Ut(CY) Several experimental conditions were explored seeking materials with hierarchical structure.\n29 Si MAS and CP/MAS NMR spectroscopy were employed systematically to confirm the condensation of the samples and the presence/absence of unreacted precursor.\nTwo major groups of samples were prepared. The first group was prepared under acidic conditions and in the presence of a large excess of water. In the m-Ut(CY)-ac compounds the focus of the study was on the influence of the chain length. In the three cases studied (Y = 14, 16 and 22) the chains adopt preferentially all-trans conformations, revealing an ordered structure. This was confirmed by 13 C/CP NMR and FT-IR spectroscopies. For Y = 16 the conformational changes to which the chains are subject during heating and cooling cycles were evaluated by means of DSC and FT-IR. These analyses were fundamental, since all the m-Ut(CY)-ac samples undergo order/disorder phase transitions. During the cooling cycle of m-Ut(C16)-ac the FT-IR data exhibit hysteresis. Unlike in m-A(14), the order/disorder phase transition, although reversible, is not apparently time-dependent. The emission quantum yields are of the same order of magnitude of that reported for the parent mono-amidosil compound.\nThe chain length corresponding to Y = 16 was also chosen to investigate the influence of the solvent in the structuring of the samples. A second group of materials emerged: m-Ut(CY)@ax. The moles of water employed (a large excess) in the preparation of the m-Ut(C16)-ac samples was replaced by a equimolar mixture of water/DMSO in the case of m-Ut(CY)@a1 and m-Ut(CY)@a2. In the latter sample, no HCl was added. In the preparation of all the samples referred up to now (i.e., m-Ut(CY)-ac and m-Ut(CY)@ax with x = 1 and 2) THF was used in the 1st stage of the synthesis. In the sixth sample prepared (m-Ut(CY)@a3) no THF was used and the entire synthesis was carried out in DMSO. However, like in all the other cases, water was added to promote the hydrolysis and condensation reactions, as well as HCl, which was incorporated as catalyst.\nThe experimental changes introduced in the synthetic procedure in the monoalkyl urethanesils did not affect structurally the m-Ut(CY)-ac family of samples and m-Ut(CY)@ax with x = 1 and 2. All of these materials exhibit a lamellar bilayer nanostructure. The m-Ut(CY)@a3 differs markedly from all the other samples. It displays order at shorter range and it is clear that its structure deserves to be studied Hybrids organic-Inorganic materials obtained by sol-gel and self-assembly techniques\tI 113\nin the near future in more depth. In terms of morphology the two series of mono-alkyl urethanesils are very attractive. We draw the attention in particular to the complex unique textures observed in m-Ut(C16)-ac and m-Ut(C22)-ac (\"cabbage-like\" and \u201cdesert rose-like\", respectively) and in ac Ut(CY)@a3 (\"origami-like\").\n2.3.5.\tReferences\n1.\tL.

While some ECDs have already reached commercialization (including self-dimming rear- and side-view mirrors and sunroofs for automobile glazing, sunglasses and aircraft canopies with controllable optical transmission), current developments in the domain of ECDs are almost entirely governed by energy saving requirements and interest has shifted rapidly from non-architectural applications toward the production of large area devices for application in smart switchable and energy efficient architectural glazing, privacy glass, partitions and skylights.\nA conventional solid state ECD comprises three main elements arranged in a layered, \"sandwich\"-type configuration composed of an electrochromic electrode and a counter-electrode separated by a solid electrolyte (e.g., a Li+ , K+ or H+ conducting polymer). A persistent and reversible color switch occurs by charging/discharging the electrochemical cell by application of an electrical potential. The colored and transparent states of ECDs are usually designated as \"written\u201d and \"bleached\u201d states, respectively. The most widely used electrochromic (EC) material is tungsten trioxide (WO3) which undergoes a reversible color change as a result of simultaneous injection and extraction of electrons and ions (double injection) [6]. EC materials may operate either in a reflective mode (displays) or transmissive mode (\"smart windows\u201d). An attractive feature of ECDs is that once they are colored, the current may be turned off and the color preserved (memory effect), making them energy efficient devices.\nOver the last few years the versatile sol-gel process [7] has become a popular synthetic route for ECD fabrication. Sol-gel processing has opened new opportunities for obtaining advanced, functional and high quality EC coatings with appropriate optical, chemical, electro-optical and mechanical properties [8-15]. The sol-gel method offers many advantages with respect to the traditional techniques used in the context of coating technology: (1) A high degree of homogeneity of the films is achieved, since\nthe starting precursors are mixed at the molecular level; (2) The precursors are relatively cheap and a large variety is commercially available; (3) The deposition equipment is inexpensive and large area coatings can be obtained by several techniques, such as spin-coating, dip-coating and spraying.\nThe first application of the \"all sol-gel\" ECD concept is thought to have taken place in 1988 with the pioneering work of Judeinstein et al. [16]. The device, with configuration WO3| titanium oxide (TiO2) gel | tin oxide (SnO2), failed due to irreversible SnO2 coloration. The first successful \"all sol-gel\" ECD was reported in 1994 by Macedo and Aegerter [17] who used a WO31 TiO2 gel | cerium oxide (CeO2)/TiO2 configuration.\nSeveral organic-inorganic hybrid electrolyte materials [18] have already been obtained via the sol-gel route. The use of ormolytes in ECDs is quite attractive because these materials are generally amorphous and highly transparent, they exhibit good mechanical properties and appropriate chemical/thermal stability. In addition, Class II [18] ormolytes can accommodate greater quantities of guest salt than polymer electrolytes (PEs) [19], thus avoiding the prejudicial effects of \u201csalting out\u201d on device performance.\nA reduced number of proton conducting Class I hybrid systems have been proposed as electrolytes for ECDs. Examples include the hybrid gels made from tetrabutoxytitane(IV), acetic acid and glycerol [16] and the amorphous tallium oxide multi-layers dip-coated from tetraethoxytallane(IV), using acetic acid or H2O as a stabilizer [20]. The proton conducting Class II aminosil ormolytes [21, 22, 23] were also considered to be good candidates for \u201csmart windows\u201d. These materials comprise a basic hybrid structure formed from aminopropylalkoxysilanes and a strong monoacid. The highest conductivity reached was ca. 3x10-5 Scm-1 at room temperature. An electrochemical stability domain of 1.3 V was reported for the aminosils doped with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid. A significant number of Li+ conducting Class II ormolyte systems have been investigated in the same context [24, 25, 26-28].\nIn view of their potential use as electrolytes in ECDs, in the present chapter we will report the preparation and characterization of two novel series of environmentally-friendly KCF3SO3- [29] and LiCF3SO3/Eu(CF3SO3)3 (50:50 molar)-doped [30] biohybrids composed of a di-urethane cross-linked siloxane-based host network incorporating short segments of the poly(s-caprolactone) biopolymer, abbreviated as 118 | Biohybrids organic-inorganic systems with potential applications in electrochromic devices\nPCL(530) (530 represents the average molecular weight in g mol-1). This study is a continuation of preliminary explorations based on the PCL(530)/siloxane network doped with lithium triflate (LiCF3SO3) [31] and magnesium triflate (Mg(CF3SO3)2) [32].\nPCL, a linear poly(ester), has been chosen because, although synthetic, it is an extremely attractive biopolymer. It is an aliphatic thermoplastic, biocompatible, permeable, hydrophobic, biodegradable and non-toxic for living organisms, which is resorbed by the organism a certain interval after implantation. PCL and its copolymers have potential applications in the field of medicine, as biodegradable suture, artificial skin, resorbable prostheses and as containers for sustained drug delivery [33-35]. PCL/silica hybrids may find use as degradable bioglasses, as coating materials for bone implants and prosthetic devices, as supports for enzyme immobilization [36] and even as bone substitutes [37].\nIn recent years there has been a growing interest for biopolymers, as they represent viable alternatives for the development of the so-called electroactive polymers (EAPs) [44]. Most bio-based EAPs are ion conducting materials. Examples of these systems include structures based on hydroxyethylcellulose [45], modified starch [46], chitosan [41-46] or natural rubber [47] with guest ionic salts. Small all solid-state ECDs with good electrochromic properties have been successfully produced with EAPs composed of cellulose [48], starch [49-50] and gelatin [51].\nReferences\n1.\tC. M.

Fortunato,\n3.1.\tK+-doped poly(s-caprolactone)/siloxane biohybrid electrolytes for electrochromic devices\n3.1.1.\tBrief Introduction\nThe high ionic conductivity exhibited by classical poly(oxyethyelene) (POE)-based PEs incorporating K+ ions [1-4] motivated early studies on ormolytes composed of diurea cross-linked poly(oxypropylene)/siloxane [5] and POE/siloxane [6, 7] (di-ureasil) matrices and potassium salts. The di-ureasils composed of long POE chains and doped with KCF3SO3 were proposed as electrolytes for the fabrication of \u201csmart windows\u201d [7]. The present section is focused on the thermal and electrochemical properties of novel PCL(530)-based biohybrid ormolytes incorporating a wide range of KCF3SO3 content. Optimized ormolyte compositions have been tested in prototype ECDs.\n3.1.2.\tExperimental part\nMaterials\na.0 hydroxyl poly(s-caprolactone) (PCL(530), Fluka, average molecular weight 530 g/mol), (3-isocyanato)propyltriethoxysilane (ICPTES, Fluka) and KCF3SO3 (Aldrich) were used as received. Ethanol (CH3CH2OH, Merck) and tetrahydrofuran (THF, Merck) were stored over molecular sieves. High purity distilled water was used in all experiments.\nSynthesis of the materials\nTo prepare the KCF3SO3-doped d-PCL(530)/siloxane-based biohybrids we applied the synthetic method described elsewhere [8], which is a modification of that reported for the LiCF3SO3-doped analog [9].\nThe synthesis of the host d-PCL(530)/siloxane hybrid involved two steps. In the first stage a urethane cross-link was formed between the hydroxyl (-OH) end groups of the PCL(530) chains and the isocyanate (-N=C=O) groups of ICPTES in THF at 70-80 \u00b0C to yield the non-hydrolyzed PCL(530)-based hybrid precursor (Scheme 3.1.1): Biohybrids organic-inorganic systems with potential applications in electrochromic devices | 123\nCH3CH2^\tON\t00\tZOCH2CH3\nCH3CH2O Si(CH2)3-N C- [O(CH2)5C]n. -OCH2CH2OCH2CH2O-[C(CH2)5O]n _C-N-(CH2)3Sr OCH2CH3\nCH3CH2O\tOCH2CH3\n2n' = 3.7\nScheme 3.1.1. Representation of the non-hydrolyzed PCL(530)-based hybrid precursor.\nIn the second stage of the synthetic procedure appropriate amounts of CH3CH2OH and water were added to this solution to promote the characteristic sol-gel reactions (i.e., hydrolysis and condensation). The guest KCF3SO3 salt was incorporated in the latter stage. The materials were obtained as transparent and flexible monoliths. The ormolytes were identified using the notation d-PCL(530)/siloxanenKCF3SO3. Xerogels with n =\t200, 100, 40, 29, 21, 10, 4, 2, 1 and 0.5 were produced. Details of\nthe synthetic procedure are provided in Table 3.1.1.\nTable 3.1.1.

The samples, analyzed as films, were not submitted to any thermal pre-treatment.\nTo evaluate the morphology of the as-prepared xerogel samples, SEM micrographs were obtained using a SEM/ESEM-FEI Quanta 400 scanning electron microscope at high acceleration voltage (25 kV).\nThe thermogravimetric studies were done in the same equipment and with the same methods described in section 2.1. The films were pulverized and dried over phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) for several days. The thermal characteristics of the xerogels were also determined using a Setaram DSC 131 Differential Scanning Calorimeter (same equipment as described in section 2.3). A disk section with a mass of approximately 20-30 mg was removed from the biohybrid film, placed in a 40 pL aluminium can and stored in a dessicator over P2O5 for one week at room temperature under vacuum. After this drying treatment the can was hermetically sealed and the thermogram was recorded. Each sample was heated from 25 to 250 \u00b0C at 10 \u00b0C min-1. High purity nitrogen at a constant flow rate of 40 cm3 min-1 (TGA) and 35 cm3 min-1 (DSC) was used as purging gas in both experiments.\nPrior to characterization of conductivity behavior, the ormolytes were vacuum-dried at 80 \u00b0C for about 48 h and stored in a high-integrity, argon-filled glove box. For bulk conductivity measurements, an ormolyte disk was placed between two 10 mm diameter ion-blocking gold electrodes (Goodfellow, >\t99.9%). The\nelectrode/ormolyte/electrode assembly was secured in a suitable constant-volume support, which was installed in a Buchi TO 51 tube oven. A calibrated type K thermocouple, placed close to the ormolyte disk, was used to measure the sample temperature with a precision of about \u00b1 0.2 \u00b0C and samples were characterized over a temperature range of between 25 and 100 \u00b0C. Bulk conductivities of the samples were obtained during heating cycles using the complex plane impedance technique (Schlumberger Solartron 1250 frequency response analyser and 1286 electrochemical interface) over a frequency range of 65 kHz to 0.5 Hz. The electrolyte behavior was found to be almost ideal and bulk conductivities were extracted in the conventional manner from impedance data by using an equivalent circuit composed of Rb in parallel with Cg, where Rb is the electrical resistance of the electrolyte and Cg is its geometric capacity. The circuit element corresponding to the blocking electrode interface was simulated by a series Cdl element, where Cdl is the double layer capacity. The\nexperimental spectra showed a high frequency semicircle with a low frequency vertical spike. Reproducibility of measurements was better than 5%.\nThe Fourier-Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectra were acquired at room temperature using the same equipment and with the same methods described in section 2.1.\nThe FT-Raman spectra were recorded in the same equipment and with the same methods described in section 2.1. The non-linear curve-fitting procedure provided by the PeakFit software (Jandel Corporation, 2591 Rerner Boulevard, San Rafael, CA 94901, U.S.A.) was applied to deconvolute complex band envelopes. The residuals procedure was used to automatically place hidden peaks. This procedure initially places peaks by finding local maxima in a smoothed data stream. Hidden peaks are then optionally added where peaks in the residuals occur. The best fit of the experimental data was obtained by varying the parameters of the bands (i.e., wavenumber, width and intensity) and by using Gaussian functions. A linear baseline correction with a tolerance of 3 % was employed. The standard error of the curvefitting procedure was less than 0.00006. The software parameters revealed that, in most cases, the three coefficients of the bands were significantly different from zero (a = 0.05). This was clear from the 95% confidence intervals (CI) for these parameters. The fact that the value \"zero\" was not included in these CIs is an indication that most bands were adequately represented by the three parameters. Frequently, the intensity was the least significant characteristic.\nSolid-state ECDs were constructed using a four layer sandwich configuration which did not include an ion storage layer (Scheme 3.1.2). The external layers of the ECDs were transparent conducting oxide films made of indium-doped zinc oxide (IZO) [10]. The active layers of the ECDs were an EC film of tungsten oxide (WO3) and a d-PCL(530)/siloxanenKCF3SO3 ormolyte film with n = 29, 21 and 4. IZO films with a thickness of about 170 nm were deposited on two glass substrates by r. f. (13.56 MHz) magnetron sputtering using a ceramic oxide target In2O3:ZnO (92:8 wt%; 5 cm-diameter, Super Conductor Materials, Suffern, NY, U.S.A., purity of 99.99%). Sputtering was carried out at room temperature, with an argon flow of 20 cm3 min-1 and an oxygen flow of 0.4 cm3 min-1. During sputtering the deposition pressure (argon and oxygen) was held constant at 0.15 Pa. The distance between the substrate and the\ntarget was 10 cm and the r. f. power was maintained at 100 W. WO3 (Super Conductor Materials, purity of 99.99%) films with thickness of about 300 nm were deposited on the IZO-coated glass substrates by r. f. magnetron sputtering (Pfeiffer Classic 500). Two drops of the ormolyte sol was then spread onto the surface of the WO3/IZO-coated glass plates, a IZO-coated glass plate was placed on top of the resulting ormolyte gel and the two plates were pressed together in such a way that the two coatings faced each other inside the assembled system (Scheme 3.1.2). In this manner a surface with an area of approximately 2.7 cm2 was formed. Free space was left on each side of the device for the electrical contacts. The entire assembly procedure described was carried out under atmospheric conditions. As a result of the application of a negative voltage of -4 V for a period of 30 s to each glass/IZO/WO3/d-PCL(530)/siloxanenKCF3SO3/IZO/glass ECD the color of the WO3 layer changed from light yellow to uniform dark blue (Scheme 3.1.2). During coloration charge in the form of electrons and K+ ions was transferred from the IZO and ormolyte films, respectively, to WO3 which suffered simultaneously reduction and K+ insertion. Bleaching from deep blue back to light yellow (Scheme 3.1.2), corresponding to simultaneous WO3 oxidation and K+ desinsertion (Equation 3.1.1), occurred upon reversing the applied voltage.\nWO3 + xK+ + xe- O KxWO3\t(3.1.1)\nbleached (light yellow) colored (blue)\nThe optical transmittance of the ECDs was measured with a Shimadzu UV/VIS 3100PC double beam spectrophotometer and with UV-VIS Spectronic Genexys 2PCC spectrophotometer.\nd-PCL(530)/siloxane KCF SO\nn 3\t3\nScheme 3.1.2.

The diffractograms of the samples with n =\t100 and 40 reveal that\nthese xerogels are entirely amorphous. The broad peak, Gaussian in shape, centered at ca. 21.3-21.6\u00b0, observed in these patterns is ascribed to ordering within the siliceous network [11]. The dilute sample with n = 200 gives rise to a peak at 21.4\u00b0, which is characteristic of PCL(530). The same feature appears as an ill-defined peak in the XRD patterns of the materials with n = 21 and 10. For n = 29 and 21 a Bragg reflection of unknown nature emerges at 28.5\u00b0. The concentrated sample with n = 4 produces a series of weak peaks which do not correspond to those of the pure salt or PCL(530). We associate them with the formation of a crystalline d-PCL(530)/siloxane-KCF3SO3 complex of unknown stoichiometry. In the salt-rich samples with n = 2, 1 and 0.5 this crystalline compound coexists with pure salt.\nn\n0\n\u25a0&amp;-\n<n\n..\nm.tlia.,ipf \u00b1.nIMW, u t\n0.5\n10\n21\n*\n*\n\n\n1\n2\n4\n29\n40\n100\n200\n. . . ...___LjL_. .\tPCL(530)\ni \u25a0 \u25a0\t\u25a0 \u25a0 i \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 i \u25a0\t\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 i \u25a0\t\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 i \u25a0\t\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 i \u25a0\t\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 i \u25a0\t\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 i 1\t\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 i\n10\t15\t20\t25\t30\t35\t40\t45\t50\n20 (\u00b0)\nFigure 3.1.1. XRD patterns of the d-PCL(530)/siloxanenKCF3SO3 biohybrids.\nThe SEM images obtained, shown in Figure 3.1.2, are in perfect agreement with the XRD data. The occurrence of crystalline PCL(530) regions is confirmed in Figures 3.1.2(a)-3.1.2(c). Small crystalline aggregates, presumably due to the formation of the crystalline d-PCL(530)/siloxane-KCF3SO3 complex, are observed at n = 4 (Figure 3.1.2(d)). The high crystalline content of the two most concentrated xerogels is immediately evident in Figures 3.1.2 (e) and 3.1.2 (f).\nFigure 3.1.2. SEM images of the d-PCL(530)/siloxanenKCF3SO3 biohybrids: (a) n = 200 (scale bar 20 pm); (b) n= 21 (scale bar 20 pm); (c) n= 10 (scale bar 20 pm); (d) n = 4 (scale bar 20 pm); (e) n= 1 (scale bar 100 pm); (f) n = 0.5 (scale bar 20 pm).\nThe DSC curves of the d-PCL(530)/siloxanenKCF3SO3 xerogels with n &lt;10 are represented in Figure 3.1.3 In the case of electrolyte samples with composition n = 10 and 2 a very weak, broad and ill-defined endothermic peak at 45 (onset at 42 \u00b0C) is readily detected. This thermal event is due to the fusion of the short polymer segments of PCL(530) (melting temperature 36-48 \u00b0C), thus corroborating the XRD data. The salt-rich biohybrid with n = 1 produces a weak, broad and ill-defined endotherm at 146 \u00b0C (onset at 132 \u00b0C), of unknown origin, and a more intense peak at 225 \u00b0C (onset at about 200 \u00b0C). The latter peak becomes more intense at n = 0.5. On the basis of the conclusions retrieved from the XRD results, we propose that this endothermic event corresponds to the fusion of the d-PCL(530)/siloxane-KCF3SO3 complex with a minor contribution from the melting peak of the pure salt which is located at 237 \u00b0C (onset at 228 \u00b0C) (Figure 3.1.3).\nFigure 3.1.3. DSC curves of the d-PCL(530)/siloxanenKCF3SO3 biohybrids.\nhe TGA data of Figure 3.1.4 allow us to deduce that the decomposition of the xerogels with > n > 1 is initiated at about the same temperature (approximately 235 \u00b0C), an indication that the thermal stability of the PCL(530)/siloxane framework in a non-oxidizing atmosphere remains practically unaffected by the presence of increasing amounts of KCF3SO3. The thermal degradation of the most concentrated material (n = 0.5) begins, however, at a considerably lower temperature (ca. 200 \u00b0C). The thermal behavior of the hybrid samples contrasts deeply with that of KCF3SO3 which only starts to degrade at temperatures above 450 \u00b0C. It is worth noting that even at the maximum temperature applied (700 \u00b0C), none of the samples was completely decomposed.\nFigure 3.1.4. TGA curves of the d-PCL(530)/siloxanenKCF3SO3 biohybrids.\nThe Arrhenius conductivity plot and the composition dependence of the conductivity isotherms of the d-PCL(530)/siloxanenKCF3SO3 samples are shown in Figures 3.1.5 (a) and 3.1.5 (b), respectively. These data reveal that in this hybrid electrolyte system the samples with compositions between n = 21 and 4 support the highest conductivities over the whole range of temperatures analyzed.

We emphasize that in this class of hybrid system the guest alkaline ions may bond, not only to the triflate ions, but also to the three types of donor oxygen atoms provided by the d-PCL(530)/siloxane network, i.e., the carbonyl oxygen atoms of the urethane cross-links, the ester carbonyl oxygen atoms of the PCL(530) chains and the ether oxygen atom of the PCL(530) central oxyethylene segment.\nThe coordination of the cation to the urethane and ester carbonyl groups of the host matrix is manifested in the \u201camide I\u201d region which corresponds to the amide I [14] region of polyamides [15]. The amide I mode is essentially a carbonyl stretching vibration [15]. As a result of its sensitivity to hydrogen bonding, the amide I band is in general composed of several distinct components which correspond to different carbonyl environments (aggregates). As the absorption coefficients of the carbonyl groups from these aggregates may differ, only changes of the same component as a function of salt concentration may be compared [16].\nCurve-fitting, performed in the 1800-1650 cm-1 interval of the FT-IR spectra of the d-PCL(530)/siloxanenKCF3SO3 xerogels, allowed us to resolve the band profile of the d-PCL(530)/siloxane hybrid into four distinct components located at about 1762, 1736, 1720 and 1692 cm-1 (Figure 3.1.6 (a)) [8, 17]. The 1762 cm-1 band is associated with the presence of \"free\" (non-hydrogen bonded) carbonyl groups of the urethane cross-links (A1, Scheme 3.1.3) [18]. The 1736 cm-1 component is characteristic of amorphous PCL(530) chains (A2, Scheme 3.1.3) [19, 20]. The band at 1720 cm-1 is attributed to the presence of hydrogen-bonded oxyethylene/urethane associations (B, Scheme 3.1.3) [21], whereas that at 1692 cm-1 is assigned to the formation of urethane/urethane(C, Scheme 3.1.3) [21] and ester/urethane [8,17] aggregates. The four types of carbonyl groups have been represented by the notations A1 (1762 cm-1, Scheme 3.1.3), A2 (1736 cm-1, Scheme 3.1.3), B (1720 cm-1, Scheme 3.1.3), C1/C2 (1692 cm-1, Scheme 3.1.3), respectively [18].\nA1\nO\n0\nA2\nO\nII\n/\n\\O,\t..\t..\t..\t..\t,\n^Si(CH2)3-N C- [O(CH2)5C]n-OCH2CH2OCH2CH2O-[C(CH2)5O]n- C N-(CH2)3SHO o'\t'\t\u2018\nO\nII\n/\nI\nX^Si(CH2)3-N C- [O(CH2)5C]n-OCH2CH2OCH2CH2O-[C(CH2)5O]n- C N-(CH2)3Si-o' o'\t'\t\u2018\nO\nII\nH '\n%C2 O 0\n/O\nA\"\no\n..\t..\t0\tZ0/\n\u25a0^Si(CH2)3-N C- [O(CH2)5C]n-OCH2CH2OCH2CH2O-[C(CH2)5O]n- C N-(CH2)3Si-O '\t'\tH >\nlB 0\nO\nII.\n..................... .. 0 >/\nO^,Si(CH2)3-N C- [O(CH2)5C]n-OCH2CH2OCH2CH2O-[C(CH2)5O]n- C N-(CH2)3Si-O\n'\tH >\ns C1\n0 0\nO\n0\nO\n0\nO\n0\n\n\nH\n4\nI\nO\n0\nO\n0\n\nO\n0\nI\n1\nScheme 3.1.3. Tentative representation of the chemical surrounding of the urethane-, esther-and ether-type oxygen atoms in the host d-PCL(530)/siloxane hybrid.\nThe general \"amide I\" band profile of the non-doped and doped d-PCL(530)/siloxane hybrid materials with n&lt;29 (Figures 3.1.6 (a) and 3.1.6 (b)) is essentially the same (the intensity maximum is located in all cases around 1736 cm-1). The further addition of salt alters the band shape and the intensity maximum is shifted to 1731 cm-1 for n = 10 and 4 and to 1725 cm-1 for n = 21, 1 and 0.5 (Figures 3.1.6 (a) and 3.1.6 (b)), suggesting that the hydrogen bonds are generally stronger in the latter Biohybrids organic-inorganic systems with potential applications in electrochromic devices | 135\nthree samples. We call attention to the fact that carbonyl groups A1 (1762 cm-1) exist in all the materials. Curiously, the plot of Figure 3.1.6 (c) demonstrates that the proportion of \"free\" carbonyl groups A1 (1762 cm-1) and A2 (1736 cm-1) practically coincides in the non-doped network and in the most concentrated sample. The trends observed in this graph also suggest that the disruption/formation of aggregates B (1720 cm-1), which results from the addition of increasing amounts of salt, is correlated with the formation/disruption of aggregates C1/C2 (1692 cm-1). Although the introduction of the alkali metal salt affects the \"amide I\" region over the entire range of compositions, the most significant modifications that the \"amide I\" components undergo take place in d-PCL(530)/siloxane29KCF3SO3. This hybrid contains the lowest proportion of carbonyl groups A1 (1762 cm-1) and the highest fraction of carbonyl groups A2 (1736 cm-1) of all the series, an indication that the strong hydrogen-bonded aggregates formed at this composition are probably aggregates C1 (1692 cm-1). In the high salt concentration range (n = 1 and 0.5), the formation of aggregates B (1720 cm-1) is clearly favored. At this composition, the fraction of aggregates C1 and C2 (1692 cm-1) is fairly low.\nThe study of the anionic environment was carried out by means of FT-Raman spectroscopy. We examined the spectral region characteristic of the symmetric stretching vibration mode of the SO3 group (vsSO3), since this diagnostic mode is very sensitive to coordination effects. The vsSO3 mode of the \"free\" triflate ion gives rise to a band at 1032 cm-1 [22]. The coordination of the triflate ion to the K+ ion is shown as a shift to higher wavenumbers [4]. The FT-Raman vsSO3 region was decomposed into several peaks (Figure 3.1.7 (a)). The most prominent band for the most dilute samples (n > 10) is that at 1032 cm-1. This feature, present over the whole salt concentration range, confirms the occurrence of \"free\" anions and presumably \"cross-link separated ion pairs\" [18, 21]. The contribution of the latter species may explain the remarkable increase of the band integral area fraction at 40 > n > 10 (Figure 3.1.7 (b)). The 1038 and 1024 cm-1 features, also produced by all the samples, are associated with weakly coordinated triflate ions located in two different sites [21]: (1) CF3SO3- species weakly bonded to K+ ions, which simultaneously interact with the carbonyl oxygen atom of the urethane group; (2) CF3SO3- ions hydrogen bonded to the urethane N-H groups. The event at 1045 cm-1, found in all the FT-Raman spectra, is ascribed to the existence of contact ion-pairs [7].\nAbsorbance (a.u.)\n21\n29\n40\n100\n200\n1800\t1780\t1760\t1740\t1720\t1700\t1680\t1660\nWavenumber (cm-1)\nn\n10\n1800\t1780\t1760\t1740\t1720\t1700\t1680\t1660\nWavenumber (cm-1)\n200 100\t40\t35\t30\t25\t20\t15\t10\t5\t0\nn\nFigure 3.1.6.

Interestingly, at n = 10 none of these coordinated species are formed. In the vsSO3 region of the two most concentrated samples, the 1052 cm-1 band is the most intense feature. Based on the XRD and DSC results, we suggest that in both cases free crystalline KCF3SO3 contributes to this feature [7]. The examination of the plot of Figure 3.1.7 (b) does not allow us to establish a direct correlation between the high room temperature ionic conductivity exhibited by the d-PCL(530)/siloxane21KCF3SO3 sample and the proportion of \"free\" anions and/or weakly-coordinated species. Samples with composition n = 29 and 10 contain similar amounts of such species and exhibit considerably lower conductivity. The ionic conductivity is the result of a combination of two contributions: the concentration of charge carriers and their mobility. Clearly, the ionic association in the materials described in this study is considerable.\nRaman shift (cm-1)\nFigure 3.1.7.

It is manifested in the following cases: (1) With salts containing cations of the same or different valence; (2) With salts composed of the same or different anionic species; (3) With variable relative amounts of the two salts. Although the origin of the increase of conductivity observed in PEs doped with a pair of ionic salts remains uncertain, changes in charge carrier type and concentration or in the microscopic viscosity have been pointed out as possible explanations. In some cases, however, the mixed cation effect does not emerge, a situation found for instance by Chowdary et al. [7] in systems composed of mixtures of poly(ethylene glycol) dimethylether and POE containing various ratios of zinc and lithium bromides.\nWith the primary goal of developing a new family of environmentally friendly multifunctional biohybrid materials displaying simultaneously high ionic conductivity and high luminescence we have produced in this section, by means of the sol-gel route\n[8], ormolytes comprising biopolymer chains and have doped them with a mixture of LiCF3SO3 and Eu(CF3SO3)3 (molar ratio LiCF3SO3:Eu(CF3SO3)3 \u00ab 50:50), in the light of the mixed cation effect. The integration of different hybrid components in a single device is of the utmost interest. This \u201clab-on-a-chip technology\u201d is expected to have a tremendous impact on information and communication technologies, global health and biomedicine, structural engineering and environment monitoring systems in the near future. Requirements such as, speed, sensitivity, specificity, ease of use, shelf-life, cost, scalability and recyclability are critical [9].\nWe note that, although a significant number of Li+-doped POE-based ormolytes have been investigated in the last decades [10-19], the references dealing with POE/siloxane ormolytes incorporating europium salts are considerably less abundant\n[20-22]. We must also emphasize that the work of Morita et al. [40] focused on POE-grafted poly(methylmethacrylate) matrices doped with LiCF3SO3 and lanthanum triflate or ytterbium triflate, is the only known study of a PE system including a mixture of an alkaline salt and a lanthanide salt. Finally, we would also like to stress that to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that the mixed cation approach is combined with the hybrid concept.\nWe have decided to employ the d-PCL(530)/siloxane structure for two reasons: (1) The electrolyte behavior of the di-urethane cross-linked d-PCL(530)/siloxane network doped with lithium triflate LiCF3SO3 [24], Mg(CF3SO3)2 [25] and KCF3SO3 [26] (section 3.1.) is quite encouraging. (2) The incorporation of Eu(tta)3(H2O)2 (tta- is 2-thenoyltrifluoracetonate) into the d-PCL(530)/siloxane matrix, not only results in a significant increase of the D0 quantum efficiency value of the aquocomplex (from 29.0 to 44.2 %), but also yields a hybrid that displays high photostability (under UVA exposure, the emission intensity decreased less than 10 % in 11 h) [27].\nThe materials studied here have been identified using the notation d-PCL(530)/siloxanenLimEum', where n (called composition) corresponds to the number of (C(=O)(CH2)5O) repeat units of PCL(530) per mixture of Li++Eu3+ ions and m and m' represent the individual compositions of LiCF3SO3 and Eu(CF3SO3)3, respectively.\n3.2.2.\tExperimental part\nMaterials\na,o-hydroxyl poly(s-caprolactone) (PCL(530), Fluka, MW = 530 gmol-1), (3-isocyanato)propyltriethoxysilane (ICPTES, Fluka, 95%), anhydrous LiCF3SO3 (Aldrich, 99.995%) and Eu(CF3SO3)3.xH2O (Aldrich, 98%) were used as received. Ethanol (EtOH, Merck, PA grade) and tetrahydrofuran (Merck, puriss. PA grade) were stored over molecular sieves. High purity distilled water was used in all experiments.\nThe synthetic method described in section 3.1 was adopted to prepare the LiCF3SO3- and Eu(CF3SO3)3xH2O-doped d-PCL(530)/siloxane-based biohybrids. The molar ratio ICPTES: EtOH:H2O used here was 1:4:1.5. Xerogels with different concentrations were produced as transparent and flexible monoliths (Figure 3.2.1).

Representative image of d-PCL(530)/siloxanenLimEum- hybrid ormolyte.\nThe samples were characterized by means of DSC, TGA, SEM, XRD, complex impedance spectroscopy and FT-IR using the the same equipments and procedures described in detail in section 3.1.\nThe room temperature photoluminescence spectrum of the complex was obtained using a ISS PC1 spectrofluorometer. The excitation device was equipped with a 300 W xenon lamp and a photographic grating. Emission spectra were collected with a 25 cm monochromator (resolution of 0.1 nm) connected to a photomultiplier. The excitation and emission slit width were fixed at 1.0 mm, with all used monochromators having 1200 grooves/mm. The experimental set up used for these lifetime measurements comprises a Nd:YAG (third harmonic) coherent laser of with A = 355 nm used as excitation the source (frequency of 5 Hz and pulse width of 7 ns), a Tektronix TDS a 1012 oscilloscope and a fast detector ET 2000. The photoluminescence features of the hybrid material were recorded at room temperature with a modular double grating excitation spectrofluorimeter with a TRIAX 320 emission monochromator (Fluorolog-3, Horiba Scientific) coupled to a R928 Hamamatsu photomultiplier, using the front face acquisition mode. The excitation source was a 450 W Xe arc lamp. The emission spectra were corrected for detection and optical spectral response of the spectrofluorimeter and the excitation spectra were weighted for the spectral distribution of the lamp intensity using a photodiode reference detector. The lifetime measurements were acquired with the setup described for the luminescence spectra using a pulsed Xe-Hg lamp (6 ps pulse at half width and 20-30 ps tail).\nThe construction of the prototype ECDs was performed according to the procedure adopted in section 3.1.\nThe optical transmittance of the ECDs was measured in the 800-350 nm range using the the same equipment referred in section 3.1.\nChronoamperometric (CA) tests were performed using a potentiostat/galvanostat (Autolab model 100) by monitoring device current response as a function of time while the applied voltage was stepped between -4 V and +4 V with a delay time at each voltage of 50 s. The ECD was cycled 30 times between the colored and bleached states, respectively. In the set-up used for measurements the electrolyte/WO3/IZO substrate played the role of working electrode (W in Scheme 3.2.1) and the IZO substrate acted as counter and reference electrodes (C and R in Scheme 3.2.1). The cathodic and anodic charge densities were determined through integration of the CA curves during the coloring and bleaching processes, respectively.\nScheme 3.2.1. Close view of the set-up used to carry out the CA tests.\n3.2.3.\tResults and discussion\nThe well known hygroscopic nature of the two guest triflate salts employed prompted us to examine the thermal behavior of the as-received compounds.\nThe TGA curve of LiCF3SO3 shown in Figure 3.2.2 (a) reveals that the decomposition of this salt is a two-step process. Below 80 \u00b0C, an initial mass loss of ca. 4 % is evident, followed by a stability plateau that ends with an abrupt mass drop stage with onset at about 425 \u00b0C. The latter event represents the main degradation stage. At 800 \u00b0C a residue that represents 15% of mass loss remains. The DSC curve of LiCF3SO3\n(Figure 3.2.2 (a)) displays an endothermic peak centered at 59 \u00b0C (Tonset at ca. 57 \u00b0C) that correlates well with the initial mass loss observed in the TGA curve. According to Lu et al. [28] this thermal event is due to the removal of free hydrogen fluoride (HF), a product that remains after the salt production process. The associated enthalpy (AH = 33 Jg-1) is much lower than the value reported by the same authors (164 J g-1) [28]. On the basis of the TGA data, we have been able to estimate the number of HF moles initially present in the as-received LiCF3SO3 and thus deduce that the exact formula of the salt is LiCF3SO3.0.4HF. Below 300 \u00b0C, another endothermic event, less intense than the former, slightly broader and centered at 135 \u00b0C (Tonset at ca. 126 \u00b0C) is detected in the DSC curve (Figure 3.2.2 (a)). As it does not imply a mass variation (see TGA curve), it might be due to a solid state phase transition [28]. The fusion of LiCF3SO3 (423 \u00b0C) occurs shortly before its decomposition (425 \u00b0C) [28]. The melting temperature is thus higher than the maximum temperature value considered in our DSC analysis (300 \u00b0C) and consequently our data do not enable us to detect this thermal event. The final residue may be associated with 1 mole of lithium fluoride (LiF) [28].\nClose analysis of the TGA curve of Eu(CF3SO3)3.xH2O (Figure 3.2.2 (b)) reveals that the thermal decomposition of this compound occurs in several stages. Below 160 \u00b0C three mass losses of ca. 16% (T &lt;90 \u00b0C), 5% (90 &lt;T &lt;137 \u00b0C) and 3% (137 &lt;T &lt;160 \u00b0C) are visible. They correspond to the loss of seven, two and one water molecules, respectively. At about 400 \u00b0C the TGA suffers an abrupt drop, which corresponds to a major, although not complete, thermal degradation of the salt. These results may be interpreted as a clear indication that three of the ten water molecules present in the decahydrated compound are strongly bonded to the Eu3+ ion and thus presumably belong to its 1st coordination sphere. Their complete removal requires temperatures of at least 160 \u00b0C. In contrast the remaining seven water molecules are considerably more labile and may be removed readily below 90 \u00b0C through simple drying procedures. The correct formula of the compound purchased is therefore [Eu(CF3SO3)3(H2O)3].7H2O. The prominent and sharp endothermic peak centered at 129 \u00b0C (Tonset difficult to determine) and that less intense and broader centered at 188 \u00b0C (Tonset = 141 \u00b0C) discerned in the DSC curve of this salt (Figure 3.2.2 (b)) are typical of dehydration of a compound comprising water molecules bound with different strength. The former DSC peak detected presumably corresponds to two processes:\nthe first takes place in the low temperature range and implies the removal of the seven labile water molecules of the compound; the second process, occurring at higher temperature, represents the cleavage of the bonds that ensure strong coordination of two water molecules in the 1st coordination shell of the lanthanide ion. The 188 \u00b0C peak is clearly associated with the most strongly Eu3+-bonded water molecule of the salt.\nThe TGA data reproduced in Figures 3.2.2 (c) and 3.2.2 (d) demonstrate that the thermal degradation of the d-PCL(530)/siloxane52.6Li99Euiii and d-PCL(530)/siloxane27.oLi50Eu56 hybrid samples is initiated at ca. 238 and 220 \u00b0C, respectively. The TGA curves also reveal that decomposition takes place in two and three steps, respectively. Beyond about 500 \u00b0C a plateau is attained in both cases, that persists up to the maximum temperature analyzed (800 \u00b0C). At the latter temperature the samples are not fully decomposed and a considerable amount of residue still remains (40-45% of the sample mass). In the case of the salt-rich sample d-PCL(530)/siloxane61Li12Eu12 (Figure 3.2.2 (e)), after an initial mass loss of about 8%, the TGA curve is subject to two major drops at 220 \u00b0C and at about 400 \u00b0C (Figure 3.2.2 (e)). At 800 \u00b0C the degradation of this material may be considered practically accomplished. At last, in the case of the most concentrated sample d-PCL(530)/siloxane3.2Li6Eu7 (Figure 3.2.2 (f)), thermal decomposition starts immediately from room temperature and is a multi-step process below 500 \u00b0C. Between this temperature and 800 \u00b0C no mass losses occur. At the maximum temperature examined ca. 20% of the sample mass persists. It is worth noting that in the four hybrid samples examined the value of the decomposition onset temperature is lower than that reported for the non-doped d-PCL(530)/siloxane (300 \u00b0C) [24], an indication that the mixture of the two guest salts exerts a non-stabilizing effect on the host d-PCL(530)/siloxane framework. This effect is critical in the case of the most concentrated hybrid d-PCL(530)/siloxane3.2Li6Eu7 (Figure 3.2.2 (f)).\nThe hybrid samples with n > 6.1 are semi-crystalline. In the case of the dilute d-PCL(530)/siloxane52.6Li99Eu111 and d-PCL(530)/siloxane27.0Li50Eu56 samples, a weak endothermic peak centered near 47 \u00b0C is seen in the DSC thermograms (Figures 3.2.2\n(c)\tand 3.2.2 (d), respectively). As the melting temperature of the crystalline organic precursor PCL(530) ranges from 36 to 48 \u00b0C, the thermal event found in both DSC\ncurves is definitely associated with the fusion of a minor proportion of free, crystalline PCL(530) chains in the PCL(530)/siloxane matrix. Based on the value reported in the literature for the bulk enthalpy of melting of 100% crystalline PCL (AHm0 = 166.7 Jg-1 [29]) and on the experimental data retrieved from the DSC thermograms of PCL(530)/siloxane52.6Li9gEu111 and PCL(530)/siloxane27.\u00b0Li5\u00b0Eu56 samples (AHm = 1.49 and 5.69 Jg-1, respectively), we concluded that the proportion of cristallinity in both samples is indeed negligible (0.9 and 3.4%, respectively). The formation of free crystalline PCL(530) regions in both hybrids is in perfect agreement with the presence of the pair of intense and sharp Bragg peaks characteristic of PCL(530) (not shown) at 23.8 and 21.6\u00b0 in their XRD patterns (Figure 3.2.3). In both diffractograms this pair of peaks coexists with a broad band centered near 21\u00b0, Gaussian in shape, also produced by the non-doped d-PCL(530)/siloxane structure and due to the coherent diffraction of the siliceous domains [30]. In contrast with previous results that supported the amorphous character of the non-doped matrix [24], in the present case the XRD pattern of d-PCL(530)/siloxane evidences the existence of crystalline PCL(530) chains (Figure 3.2.3). It is noteworthy that the formation of crystalline domains of PCL(530) was also reported in the case of d-PCL(530)/siloxane-based materials doped with the Eu(tta)3(H2O)2 and Eu(tta)3phen (phen is 1,10-phenantroline) complexes [27]. The nature of the second peak centred at 200 \u00b0C in the DSC thermogram of d-PCL(530)/siloxane27.0Li50Eu56 hybrid is unknown. In the case of the d-PCL(530)/siloxane6.1Li12Eu12 material, as the Bragg peaks discerned in its XRD pattern (Figure 3.2.3) do not coincide with those produced by LiCF3SO3 (not shown), [Eu(CF3SO3)3(H2O)3].7H2O (not shown) or PCL(530) (not shown), we are led to conclude that a new crystalline phase is formed. The DSC curve depicted in Figure 3.2.2 (f) confirms that the thermal decomposition of the most concentrated sample studied is a highly complex process that is initiated immediately after the beginning of the measurement, all the endothermic peaks observed being entirely attributed to degradation reactions.\nO)\nCD\nTemperature (\u00b0C )\nTemperature (\u00b0C)\nTemperature (\u00b0C)\nHeat flow (mW/g)\nFigure 3.2.2.

XRD patterns of the d-PCL(530)/siloxanenLi mEum\u2019 hybrids.\nIn the SEM images recorded for d-PCL(530)/siloxane52.6Li50Eu56 (Figures 3.2.4 (c) and 3.2.4 (d)) and d-PCL(530)/siloxane27.0Li50Eu56 (Figures 3.2.4 (e) and 3.2.4 (f)) the presence of crystalline PCL(530) chains (Figures 3.2.4 (a) and 3.2.4 (b)) is visible. As expected, the texture of these samples contrasts deeply with that reported earlier for amorphous d-PCL(530)/siloxane based materials [31]. The formation of a new crystalline phase in the d-PCL(530)/siloxanenLimEum' system at high salt content is clearly recognized in the SEM images of Figures 3.2.4 (g) and 3.2.4 (h)). Figures 3.2.4 (i) and (j) show the high crystalline nature of the most concentrated sample, which confirms XRD data (Figure 3.2.3).\nFigure 3.2.4. SEM images of the d-PCL(530)/siloxanenLi mEum' hybrids with n =&lt;x> (scale bars = 100 0m (a) and 20 gm (b)), n = 52.6 (scale bars = 200 gm (c) and 20 gm (d)), n = 27 (scale bars = 200 gm (e) and 20 gm (f)), n = 6.1 (scale bars = 200 gm (g) and 10 gm (h)) and n = 3.2 (scale bars = 100 gm (i) and 20 gm (j)).\nHigh ionic conductivity (higher than 10-5 Scm-1) is definitely one of the most important requirements that need to be fulfilled in a PE system if practical applications in electrochemical devices are envisaged. The main conclusion derived from our earlier work conducted on the d-PCL(530)/siloxane biohybrid system doped with LiCF3SO3 was that the conductivities exhibited by these materials are modest [24] with respect to those observed in classical LiCF3SO3-containing PEs extensively reported in the literature.\nThe Arrhenius conductivity plot of the d-PCL(530)/siloxanenLimEum' biohybrids is reproduced in Figure 3.2.5 (a). This graph also shows the temperature dependence of the ionic conductivities of some of the PCL(530)/siloxanenLiCF3SO3 samples studied previously. [24] Examination of Figure 3.2.5 (a) allows us to state that the addition of a mixture of LiCF3SO3 and [Eu(CF3SO3)3(H2O)3].7H2O to the host d-PCL(530)/siloxane matrix instead of simply LiCF3SO3 was successful, as a remarkable enhancement of the ionic conductivity resulted [24], a clear manifestation of the cation mixed effect. For instance, while at 25 \u00b0C the conductivity of the d-PCL(530)/siloxane52.6Li99Euin hybrid is ca. 2x10-8 S cm -1, at about 100 \u00b0C it attains 2.3x10-6 Scm -1 (Figure 3.2.5 (a)). These values are approximately one order of magnitude higher than those measured previously for the d-PCL(530)/siloxane matrix doped solely with LiCF3SO3 and n = 93 (5.44x10-9 and 5.93x10-7 Scm-1 at 27 and -100 \u00b0C, respectively) [24] (Figure 3.2.5 (a)). In the high temperature range (at ca. 100 \u00b0C), the conductivity of the d-PCL(530)/siloxane3.2Li6Eu7 sample practically coincides with that of the most conducting composition of the d-PCL(530)siloxanenLiCF3SO3 series (n = 0.5) (2.94x10-5 and 3.2x10-5 Scm-1, respectively [24]). The conductivity maximum of the d-PCL(530)/siloxanenLimEum' system is located at n = 6.1 over the whole range of temperatures studied (3.7x10-7 and 1.71x10-4 Scm-1 at 20 and 102 \u00b0C, respectively) (Figure 3.2.5 (c)).\nThe microelectrode cyclic voltammogram of the d-PCL(530)/siloxane27.0Li50Eu56 hybrid over the -2.0-8.0 V potential range obtained at 30 \u00b0C is depicted in Figure 3.2.6. This voltammogram demonstrates that in the anodic region the sample is stable up to about 5.0 V versus Li/Li+, whereas the cathodic region lithium deposition is not detected (see Experimental Section). This means that the overall redox stability of d-PCL(530)/siloxane27.0Li50Eu56 spans more than 7 V, an indication that this material displays an acceptable stability window for an application in a solid state electrochemical device. These results are in perfect agreement with those found for d-PCL(530)siloxane0.5LiCF3SO3 [24].\n111\t97\t84\t71\t60\t49\t39\t30\t21\n10-3\n\u25a0 i \u25a0 i \u25a0 i \u25a0 i \u25a0 i\nJ I i I i L\n(a)\n10-3\n10-41\n\u25bc\n\u25bc\nA..\nA\n10-51\n%\nA\nA\n\u25bc\n\u25bc\n\u25bc\n\u25bc\n\u00bb-6-\n4-- 10'\nE\no\nOT\ne 10\n\u25a1\n*\n\u25a1\n\u25a1\n\u25a1\no\no.\nA\n\u25bc\n\u25bc\nA\n*\n\u25a1\no o\nA\n\u25a1\nA\nQ\naa\n\no\nA\n\u25bc\nQo\nA\n\u25a1\n\u25a1\n\tn\t\t\tm\tm'\n10-8:\t\t\u25a1\t93\t93\t0\n\t\t\u25a0\t52.6\t99\t111\n\t\t\t27\t50\t56\n\t\t\u25bc\t6.1\t12\t12\n10-9\u2019\t\t\u2022\t3.2\t6\t7\n\t\tA\t2.3\t2.3\t0\n\t\to\t0.5\t0.5\t0\n\t\t\t\t\t\n10\t\t1 1\t1 1\t1 1\t1 1\n2,6\t\t2,7\t2,8\t2,9\t3,0\t\n\u25a0>\u2014r\n3,1\n\u25a1\n\u25a1\n*\n\u25a1\n*\u2022\n\u25a1\n\u25a1\n\u25a0>\u2014i\u2014\u25a0\u2014i\u2014\u25a0\u2014i-\n3,2\t3,3\t3,4\n2,5x1 &amp;\t\tLl6EU1H\tT = 34 1AC\t(b)\n\t\u25a0\tL50EL^6\tT = 34 AC\t\n2,0x16\t\u25bc\tLi12EU12\tT = 37 'AC\t\n\t0\tL6EU7\tT = 35 AC\t\n\u00a141,5x1 &amp; N\t\t\t\t\u25a0\n1,0x16\t\tO\tO \u00b0\t\u00b0\t\u00b0 o\t0\n5,0x16-\t0 o\tO O\t\to 0 o O\to\n0\t0-\t\t\t\"x/\tV\n\u2019 0\t,0\t5,0x10\t1,0x10 1,5x10\t2,0x10 2,5x1\nZ(Q)\n10-4\n10-5\nE o\nO\nD\n10-6\n10-7\n10-8\n52.6\t27.0\t6.1\t3.2\nT\nT\n1000/T (K-1)\nn\nFigure 3.2.5.

Cyclic voltamogram of the d-PCL(530)/siloxane27.0Li50Eu56 hybrid obtained at about 30 \u00b0C with a 25 pm gold microelectrode as working electrode and lithium as counter and reference electrodes (sweep rate = 100 mVs-1).\nTo elucidate the role played by the carbonyl (C=O) oxygen atoms of the urethane cross-links in the coordination of the Eu3+ and Li+ ions, we have inspected the signature of the d-PCL(530)/siloxanenLi mEum' hybrids in the \u201camide I\u201d region of the FT-IR spectra. After incorporation into the hybrid host framework, several types of interactions may be enviasaged for the Li+ and Eu3+ ions [27]: (1) bonding to the \u201cfree\u201d urethane C=O groups of the cross-links; (2) bonding to \u201cfree\u201d esther C=O groups of the PCL(530) chains; (3) bonding to C=O groups belonging to hydrogen-bonded aggregates (oxyethylene/urethane aggregates, urethane/urethane aggregates and esther/urethane aggregates) [27]. Obviously, coordinating situation (3) implies the rupture of the hydrogen-bonded array formed throughout pristine d-PCL(530)/siloxane.\nThe \u201camide I\u201d region of the di-urethane cross-linked d-PCL(530)/siloxanenLi mEum' hybrids corresponds to the amide I region (1800-1600 cm-1) of polyamides [32].\nThe \u201camide I\u201d region of the FT-IR spectrum of the non-doped d-PCL(530)/siloxane matrix contains four distinct components located at about 1762, 1736, 1720 and 1692 cm-1 [31]. The high frequency bands at 1762 and 1736 cm-1 are\nassociated with \"free'' C=O groups of the urethane cross-links (A1, Scheme 3. 1.3, section 3.1) [31] and \"free\" C=O groups of the esther groups of amorphous PCL(530) chains (A2, Scheme 3.1.3, section 3.1) [33]. The component at 1720 cm-1 is attributed to oxyethylene/urethane aggregates (B, Scheme 3.1.3, section 3.1), whereas the 1692 cm-1 feature is assigned to C=O groups belonging to considerably more ordered hydrogen-bonded urethane/urethane aggregates (C1, Scheme 3.1.3, section 3.1) and ester/urethane aggregates (C2 Scheme 3.1.2, section 3.1) [31].\nFigure 3.2.7 (a) proves that the inclusion of LiCF3SO3 and [Eu(CF3SO3)3(H2O)3].7H2O into d-PCL(530)/siloxane produces a series of marked modifications in the environment of the C=O groups which are manifested in the \"amide I\" region in terms of band redistribution. Globally the incorporation of increasing amounts of the guest salts leads to a strengthening of the hydrogen bonds, to the saturation of the urethane free C=O groups A1 and to the formation of new, very strong and cation-coordinated hydrogen-bonded aggregates D. Further conclusions may be drawn from the analysis of the plot of Figure 3.2.7 (b): (a) The fraction of \"free\" urethane C=O groups A1 is subject to a regular reduction. No such groups remain at n = 3.2; (b) The fraction of \"free\" esther C=O groups A2 increases slightly in d-PCL(530)/siloxane52.6Li99Eu111 and then is significantly reduced, reaching a minimum value in the d-PCL(530)/siloxane6.iLii2Eui2 material. In the most concentrated sample the proportion of these C=O groups increases, recovering the value observed at n = 27.0; (c) The most dramatic effect resulting from salts addition is undoubtedly the marked increase in the proportion of oxyethylene/urethane aggregates B which become dominant in the sample d-PCL(530)/siloxane6.1Li12Eu12. At n = 3.2 a considerable fraction of these aggregates B are, however, disrupted; (d) The variation of the fraction urethane/urethane aggregates C1 with the incorporation of increasing amount of salts resembles closely that of the \"free\" esther C=O groups A2. This means that in samples with n = 27.0 and 6.1 a partial breakdown of these aggregates occurs, but that in contrast they are formed again at higher salt content; (e) The proportion of esther/urethane aggregates C2 does not suffer major changes over the whole salt concentration range examined, although we note a regular increase in samples with n &lt;52.6; (f) New hydrogen-bonded aggregates D, stronger than all the others already existent, are formed in d-PCL(530)/siloxane6.1Li12Eu12. Their fraction increases in the most concentrated sample studied.\n(a)\n( n e) eoueqjosqv\n27.0\nWavenumber (cm-1)\nFigure 3.2.7.

This sample is very rich in oxyethylene/urethane aggregates B, formed at the expense of the breakdown of urethane/urethane aggregates C1 and of \"free\" urethane C=O groups A1. In parallel, a drastic reduction of the \"free\" esther C=O groups A2 is necessary for the formation of more esther/urethane aggregates C2 and especially of the new very strong aggregates D.\nTo investigate the chemical surroundings of the triflate ions at increasing content of the mixed salts we analyzed the FT-IR spectra of the d-PCL(530)/siloxanenLi mEum' hybrids in the region of the symmetric stretching vibration mode of the SO3 (vsSO3) group. This non-degenerated mode of the triflate ion is very sensitive to coordination effects. We note that in the light of this spectroscopic analysis the two populations of triflate ions present (i.e., that originating from LiCF3SO3 and that originating from Eu(CF3SO3)3) are indistinguishable.\nFigure 3.2.8 (a) reproduces the vsSO3 region of three representative d-PCL(530)/siloxanenLi mEum' hybrids. The vsSO3 band was resolved into four components Figure 3.2.8 (b): a prominent band at 1032 cm-1, two shoulders positioned around 1038 and 1025 cm-1 and a weak peak centered at about 1045 cm-1. The detection of the 1031 cm-1 band indicates the presence of free anions in the three samples [34]. The contribution of the so-called \"cross-link separated ion pairs\" to this feature is very likely [35]. The shoulders at 1038 and 1025 cm-1 are ascribed to weakly coordinated triflate ions located in two different anionic environments [35]. Based on the literature, the event at 1045 cm-1 may be associated with the formation of monodentate Li+CF3SO3- ions pairs or negatively charged triplets [Li(CF3SO3)2]- [36-38]. Although in the case of mono-urethanesil POE/siloxane compounds doped with Eu(CF3SO3)3, we assigned the 1045 cm-1 band to the formation of a POE/Eu(CF3SO3)3 crystalline compound of unknown stoichiometry [35], in the present series of hybrids the contribution of the Eu3+ ions to the 1045 cm-1 feature is uncertain. Figure 3.2.8 (c) shows that d-PCL(530)/siloxane27.0Li50Eu56 contains a high concentration of \"free'' ions (1031 cm-1) and weakly coordinated triflate ions (1037 cm-1). Upon introduction of more salt (n =6.1) the fraction of \"free'' ions decreases at the expense of a further\nincrease of the percentage of weakly coordinated anions (1037 and 1025 cm-1). In addition, the proportion of associated ions is also subject to an increase (1045 cm-1). In contrast with the expected situation, these trends are accompanied by a significant increase of the room temperature ionic conductivity. In the salt-rich d-PCL(530)/siloxane3.2Li6Eu7 material, in spite of the fact that the fraction of \"free'' ions displays a slight increase and that the fraction of associated species decreases significantly, the ionic conductivity suffers a dramatic decrease.\nFigure 3.2.9 (a) shows the d-PCL(530)/siloxane27Li50Eu56 emission under different excitation wavelengths. The emission spectra are composed of a large band, whose energy depends on the excitation wavelength, superimposed on a series of sharp peaks attributed to the Eu3+ 5D0 >7F04 transitions. A similar broad emission was already observed in the non-doped d-PCL(530)/siloxane hybrid, being ascribed to electron-hole recombination occurring within oxygen-related defects present in the siliceous domains and within the cross-linkages groups [27]. The emission energy dependence on the excitation wavelength was modeled as radiative recombinations involving thermal relaxation within localized states, in the framework of the extended multiple trapping approach [39-40]. The presence of the host-related band indicates a non-efficient energy transfer PCL(530)/siloxane-to- Eu3+ ions, which in fact can be used to produce multi-wavelength light-emitters. In particular, taking advantage of the relative intensity variation of the d-PCL(530)/siloxane broad band emission and of the Eu3+ lines, the fine tuning of the emission color coordinates within the Commission Internationale d'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity diagram becomes easy (Figure 3.2.9 (b)). The emission color of the d-PCL(530)/siloxane27Li50Eu56 sample can be easily tuned from the pink region (0.43,0.29) excited at 260 nm to the yellow-green area (0.37,0.54) under 464 nm, crossing the white region (0.29,0.28) at 393 nm excitation wavelength, as illustrated in the CIE chromaticity diagram.\nFocusing our analysis on the intra-f6 lines, we observe that the energy, full width at half maximum (fwhm) and number of Stark components of the 5D0>7F1-4 transitions are almost independent of the selected excitation wavelength, suggesting that the Eu3+ occupy a single average local environment. Moreover, the presence of the 5D0>7F0 line and the Stark splitting of the 7F1,2 levels in 3 and 4 components, respectively, points out a low local-symmetry for the Eu3+-coordination site with the absence of an inversion centre, in agreement with the high relative intensity of the 5D0>7F2 transition.\nco o\nI----'---1---'----1---'----1---'----1--'-----1--'----1\n1060\t1050\t1040\t1030\t1020\t1010\t1000\nn\nFigure 3.2.8.

The curves are well reproduced by a single exponential function, in good agreement with the presence of a single average Eu3+-local environment. The single exponential fit yielded 5D0 lifetime values of 0.225 \u00b10.001 ms and 0.262 \u00b10.002 ms, for d-PCL(530)/siloxane27.0Li50Eu56 and d-PCL(530)/siloxane 52.6Li9gEu111, respectively.\nWavelength (nm)\nFigure 3.2.9.

Configuration of the glass/IZO/WO3/d-PCL(530)/siloxane6.1Li12Eu12/IZO/glass ECDs investigated (polarity for the coloration mode).\nWe draw the attention to the fact that it did not include, as usual, an ion storage layer [41]. The outermost layers included (transparent conducting oxide (TCO) films made of indium-doped zinc oxide (IZO) [42]) provided the electronic contacts through which a voltage difference was applied to the active layers of the device. The active layers were an electrochromic (EC) film of tungsten oxide (WO3) and an ion conducting (IC) film of d-PCL(530)/siloxane6>1Li12Eu12, the most conducting ormolyte sample of the series studied in the present work (Figure 3.2.5 (c)).\nThe electrochromic contrast of an ECD may be expressed in terms of the percent transmittance change (A%T) at a specified wavelength (or over a specified wavelength range) for which the EC material exhibits the highest optical contrast. Optical switching of the glass/IZO/WO3/d-PCL(530)/siloxane61Li12Eu12/IZO/glass ECD from light yellow to uniform dark deep blue occurred by charging/discharging the electrochemical cell through the application of a potential of -4 V and +4 V during 50 s, respectively (see\npictures at the bottom of Figure 3.2.10). We note that potential values lower than this did not lead to any color change. The transmission spectra obtained in the wavelength range between 340 and 800 nm for the as-deposited, colored and bleached states are reproduced in Figure 3.2.10.\nUniversidade deTr\u00e1s-os-Montes e Alto Douro\nr\u00e1s-os-Montes\ne Alto Douro\n\nFigure 3.2.10. Transmission spectra of the as-deposited (black line), bleached (red line) and colored (blue line, 1st cycle) glass/IZO/WO3/d-PCL(530)/siloxane6.1Li12Eu12/IZO/glass ECD. The pictures shown below the graphic reproduce the bleached and colored states of this ECD.\nAll the spectra display a series of maxima and minima in this spectral region assigned to interference, resulting from the presence of a multilayer structure (Scheme 3.2.2). The average transmittance of the d-PCL(530)/siloxane6.1Li12Eu12-based ECD in the VIS region (400-700 nm) is practically identical for the as-deposited and bleached states (64.6 and 60.2%, respectively), being 44.9 % for the colored state. The change in optical density (A(OD)) (where A(OD) = -log (Tcolored/Tbleached)) in the VIS region is thus 0.13. This value coincides with that calculated at 555 nm (Tbleached = 41 % and Tcolored = 58 %). We recall that the human eye is sensitive to light waves for which the wavelength is between about 400 and 700 nm (visible region). Under abundant\nillumination (daylight) the maximum eye sensitivity lies in the green region at 555 nm (photopic vision) (dotted curve in Figure 3.2.10).\nThe switching speed (or device response time) of an ECD corresponds to the time required for the coloring/bleaching process. Among other factors, the switching speed depends on the ionic conductivity and thickness/morphology of the electrolyte and on the magnitude of the applied potential [43]. The response times of the prototype ECD reported here (t \u00ab 50 s) are fast.\nThe coloration efficiency (CE) of the\tglass/IZO/WO3/d-\nPCL(530)/siloxane6.1Li12Eu12/IZO/glass ECD was determined on the basis of CA measurements (Figure 3.2.11). The CE is a spectrally dependent parameter which measures the amount of charge necessary to produce the optical change. It is defined as the change in optical density per unit of inserted charge (CE = A(OD)/AQ). A high CE represents a large optical modulation at small charge insertion/desinsertion. During coloration from light yellow to uniform dark blue, a voltage of -4 V was applied during50 s (Figure 3.2.11 (a)) and charge, in the form of electrons and Li+ ions, was transferred from the TCO and IC layers, respectively, to the EC layer (Scheme 3.2.3). Under these conditions, WO3 suffered reduction and simultaneous Li+ insertion. Upon reversing the polarity of the applied voltage, bleaching resulted (i.e., WO3 was oxidated and Li+ was desinserted) and the device recovered its initial state, i.e., from uniform dark deep blue to light yellow. In the present study, the device was cycled during a very short period of time (1500 s corresponding to 15 cycles) (Figure 3.2.11 (b)).\nFigure 3.2.12 shows that the charge density decreases gradually with cycling, although this tendency is more abrupt during the first 5 cycles.It may be also inferred from Figure 3.2.12 that the ratio of the cathodic to the anodic charges (Qin/Qout) of the device decreases with cycling, demonstrating a progressive improvement of the charge insertion/desinsertion reversibility. For the 2nd cycle a high CE value of 577 cm2C-1 was estimated for an A(OD) of 0.15. The short period of time covered by the CA measurements (only 15 cycles) does not enable us to comment of the stability of the glass/IZO/WO3/d-PCL(530)/siloxane6.1Li12Eu12/IZO/glass ECD.\n0,04\nE o&lt;\nE\n-0,03--\n0\n0,03\n0,02\n0,01\n0,00\n-0,01\n-0,02\n(b)\nT--1-1-1--1-1-1-1--1-1-1--1-1-1-1--1-1-1--1-1-1--1-1-1-1--1-\n250\t500\t750\t1000\t1250\t1500\nt (s)\nFigure 3.2.11.

The data corresponding to the 1st insertion were discarded.\nThe electrochromic memory of an ECD is the ability to hold its absorption state while the current is off. Figure 3.2.13 demonstrates that the open circuit memory of our prototype ECD is quite good (approximately 1 month). The extremely encouraging results observed in this exploratory study confirm the advantages that derive from the use of the d-PCL(530)/siloxane6.1Li12Eu12 material in ECDs. Further optimization of the procedures is obviously required, since improvements in switching speed, stability and optical memory and the application of lower operating voltages should be expected. Long-term operation of ECDs is known to depend critically on the production of defect-free ormolyte thin films and air-free sealing of the device.[43] The inclusion of a counter-electrode layer with high ion-storage capacity in future tests of this ECD is absolutely necessary to ensure the existence of a sufficient number of ions to produce a deep coloration of the WO3 active EC layer and for the device to remain stable.\n100\n80-\ncolored\n2 days\n12 days\n\u2019 (a)\n90-\nFigure 3.2.13.

The curve drawn in (b) is just a guide for the eyes.\n3.2.4.\tConclusions\nThe thermal (DSC and TGA), structural (XRD and FT-IR spectroscopy), electrochemical (ionic conductivity and CV) and photoluminescence properties of a novel series of LiCF3SO3- and Eu(CF3SO3)3-doped di-urethane cross-linked\nPCL(530)/siloxane biohybrids induced us to carry out preliminary tests of the performance of prototype ECDs incorporating these luminescent materials as electrolytes. The extremely promising results obtained for the switching time, optical density change, open circuit memory and high coloration efficiency lead us to foresee that these materials may find application in \u201csmart windows\u201d and other ECD-based devices, thus justifying further studies. However, several aspects will have to be taken into account in future for the improvement of their performance. The inclusion of counter-electrode layer with high ion-storage capacity is mandatory to ensure a sufficient number of ions for deeper coloration of the WO3 layer at lower voltage, and therefore for the enhancement of both device stability and cyclability. The optimization of the ECD assembly procedure is another requirement that needs to be fulfilled. Problems related with the presence of air and/or defects in the electrolyte films produced during sealing might explain why the parameters deduced for the three prototype ECDs tested in this work, although not significantly different, did not match exactly. The control of moisture during device construction is also advisable. Another aspect that remains to examined is the variation of the A(OD) with ormolyte composition.\n3.2.5.\tReferences\n1.\tD. P.

In recent years the potential of this inorganic compound in orthopedics [3] and drug delivery [4, 10] have been recognized. The CaCO3 biomineral of invertebrates, such as mollusks shells and a sea urchin spines, have been particularly well studied due to their accessibility and because of the high degree of crystallographic control that is achieved in these biologically formed crystals.\nCaCO3 crystallizes into three anhydrous polymorphic forms: rhombohedral calcite (the most stable), orthorhombic aragonite and hexagonal vaterite (the least stable and the most rare). Their conventional morphologies are rhomboedral, needle-like and spheroidal, respectively. In addition, CaCO3 has three metastable polymorphs: two well-defined hexahydrate and monohydrate compounds and an amorphous form which occurs in many biological organisms [11]. The hydrated forms are calcium carbonate monohydrated, calcium carbonate hexahydrated and amorphous CaCO3 (ACC). Calcite and aragonite are by far the most widely produced forms of calcium carbonate in biology. The less stable phases can be transformed to calcite, the thermodynamically most stable phase. Because magnesium ions are readily accommodated in calcite lattice, many biological calcites contains Mg2+ ions up to levels of 30% mol [12]. Biogenic ACC was first identified at the beginning of the twentieth century when investigators noted that certain CaCO3 deposits were isotropic when observed between crossed Nichols using polarized light. These phases do not diffract x-rays. Many organisms use ACC as a transient intermediate to form single crystals of calcite and aragonite with elaborate shapes.\nBesides its importance as a structural biomaterial, CaCO3 is also of interest for fundamental studies on templates-mineral interactions due to its sensitivity for templates effects. Both in a biological and in a synthetic environment, the formation of\nAdditives can inhibit the development of the energetically most stable product, thus yielding one of the other polymorphs. This means that the crystal size is kept below the critical size for the formation of the crystalline polymorphs or that the dissolution-reprecipitation step that allow the formation of crystals is prevented [13].\nMany examples of adittives can be found in the literature. One of the most popular examples is the magnesium ion [12, 14,]. But the field of research has been enlarged to polymers/block copolymers [15, 16], dendrimers [17], surfactants [18, 19] and more recently ionic liquids [20].\nReferences\n1.\tS.

Fernandes, F. A. Almeida Paz, V. de Zea Bermudez\nCrystal Growth &amp; Design, submitted\n4.1. Ionic liquid-assisted morphology tuning of calcium\ncarbonate in ethanolic solution\n4.1.1.\tBrief Introduction\nIonic liquids (ILs) are a very attractive class of salts, composed of organic cations and inorganic or organic anions, which are generally liquid below 100 \u00b0C. ILs display a series of unique characteristics, such as high fluidity, thermal and chemical stability, ability to dissolve a variety of materials and high ionic conductivity. Because of their low toxicity, non-flammability, non-measurable vapour pressure and recyclability, they are considered as \"green\" solvents in contrast with classical organic compounds [1]. The potential of ILs is further emphasized by the fact that they have tuneable physicochemical properties that can be finely tailored to suit a particular purpose simply through a judicious adjustment of their chemical structure (i.e., through the variation of both the cation and the anion).\nApplications of ILs in organic synthesis [2], catalysis [3], extraction [4] and electrochemistry [5] have been widely reported. More recently, ILs have started to be explored as environmentally benign reaction media for the production of inorganic materials [6-8]. Interestingly, ILs can sometimes act, not only as solvents, but also as reactants and morphology templates for the fabrication of inorganic matter with novel or improved properties [6-12]. Apart from their morphology-modifying effect, ILs may also lower nucleation energies and influence polymorph selectivity [13]. In this sense, ILs may be considered as chemically simple all-in-one systems suitable for \"crystal tectonics\", i.e., for the synthesis of advanced inorganic crystal architectures with hierarchically complex structures and optimized features [14].\nIn spite of its natural abundance and tremendous potential for conventional industry and biomedicine, the precipitation of CaCO3 mediated by ILs has been little explored. Hollow calcite spheres were obtained in a solution of CO2-saturated 1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidinium lactate [15], whereas high surface area mesoporous CaCO3\nwith straw-like bundles morphology was synthesized in 1-methyl-3-pentylimidazolium pyruvate [16}. More recently, Zhao et al. [17] produced unusual rod-like and dendritelike aragonite nanoparticles in the presence of 1-dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide, respectively.\nIn the present work we have investigated the structure and morphology of CaCO3 samples crystallized in the presence of five different ILs whose chemical structure and notation are indicated in Scheme 4.1.1. While four of these compounds are composed of imidazolium-based cations, the fifth contains a pyrrolidinium-based cation. Two types of counter-anions have been considered in this study: the chloride (Cl-) and tetrafluoroborate (BF4-) ions. To precipitate CaCO3 we have adopted Lee et al. [18] s straightforward method which relies on the presence of ethanol as the reaction medium and calcium chloride (CaCl2) and ammonium carbonate ((NH4)2CO3) as the sources of calcium and CO2, respectively. This procedure is extremely attractive, because it does not require any elaborate pH control or the addition of additives. The use of (NH4)2CO3 instead of CO2 allows the reaction medium to maintain at neutral or weakly basic pH caused by the dissolution of ammonia. Moreover, the water vapour derived from the sublimation of (NH4)2CO3 presumably participates in the formation of bicarbonate, carbonate, and ammonium ions, though in small amounts, in ethanol [18].\nWe have tested several parameters, in particular the influence of the C/Ca ratio, the IL concentration and the reaction temperature.\n4.1.2.\tExperimental part\nMaterials\nCalcium chloride dehydrate (CaCl2.2H2O, Panreac), ammonium carbonate ((NH4)2CO3, Riedel-de Haen) and the ionic liquids 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Emim]Cl, Solvionics), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Bmim]Cl, Solvionics), 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium chloride ([Bmpyr]Cl, Solvionics), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([Emim]BF4, Solvionics) and 1-ethanol-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([HOmim]BF4, Solvionics) (Scheme 4.1.1) were\nused as received.

The whole set was then covered with a vessel, to allow the diffusion of CO2 vapour from (NH4)2CO3 into the solution (Scheme 4.1.2), and maintained at room temperature in a fume hood (Figure 4.1.1 (a)) or inside a refrigerator at 9 \u00b0C (Figure\n4.1.2\t(b) and Table 4.1.1). As the reaction progressed the solution phase became milky white. A white precipitate deposited at the bottom of the Petri dish after 24 hrs or ca.\none week, respectively. The jelly-like precipitate was then centrifuged with 5 ml of distilled water at 2000 r.p.m. for 5 min. After repeating this washing operation several times, the precipitate was transferred to an oven at 50 \u00b0C, where it remained for\nseveral days to remove the adsorbed water.\nScheme 4.1.2.

Prior to being analyzed the samples were coated with Au/Pd. X-ray Diffraction (XRD): Powder X-ray diffraction data (PXRD) suitable for phase identification were collected at ambient temperature on a X'Pert MPD Philips diffractometer (Cu Ka1,2 X-radiation, Xi = 1.540598 A and X2 = 1.544426 A), equipped with a X'Celerator detector and a flatplate sample holder in a Bragg-Brentano para-focusing optics configuration (40 kV, 50 mA). Intensity data were collected by the step-counting method (step 0.04\u00b0), in continuous mode, in the co. 5 &lt;20 &lt;50\u00b0 range. Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR): The FT-IR spectra were acquired at room temperature in the 4000-400 cm-1 range by averaging 64 scans at a resolution of 4 cm-1, using a Unicam FT-IR spectrophotometer. To prepare the pellets, 2 mg of the samples were mixed and finely ground with 175 mg of potassium bromide (KBr, Merck, spectroscopic grade) and pressed under vacuum.\n4.1.3.\tResults and discussion\nMicrocube-shaped crystals of CaCO3 were obtained when no IL was added to the reaction medium, independently of the C:Ca ratio used (Figure 4.1.2). As expected, the rhombohedra formed correspond to calcite (see XRD patterns in Figure 4.1.3 (a), although a minor amount of NH4Cl remained in both samples. The FT-IR spectra reproduced in Figure 4.1.3 (b) exhibit the characteristic absorption bands of calcite at 875 and 712 cm-1, ascribed to the v2 mode (due to carbonate out-of-plane bending vibration) and v4 mode (due to in-plane bending vibration), respectively [19].\nCEMUP Branco\nFigure 4.1.2 SEM images of CaCO3 precipitated at room temperature in the absence of any IL.\nMolar ratios C/Ca \u00ab 1 (CC#1: (a) and (b)) and C/Ca \u00ab 2 (CC#2: (c) and (d)).\nThe addition of ILs to the ethanolic solution of CaCl2 affected the crystallization of CaCO3 leading to a series of more or less marked morphological changes.\nIntensity (a.u.)\n26 0\n1\nWavenumber (cm )\nFigure 4.1.3.

At lower temperature the aggregates became significantly denser, comprising essentially calcite (Figure 4.1.4) microcubes of CC#4 with regular, plate-like faces Figure 4.1.5 (d)).\n;emup\nCEM'-'P LB150F\nFigure 4.1.5 SEM images of CaCO3 precipitated at room temperature (CC#3: (a) and (b)) and 9 \u00b0C (CC#4: (c) and (d)).

In contrast, when the reaction was carried out at much lower temperature these \"gruyere\"-type objects were no longer observed Figure 4.1.7 (d). Under the latter experimental conditions the aggregates of CC#6 produced were smaller and less dense (Figure 4.1.7 (d)) and comprise essentially calcite (Figure 4.1.6). It is also worth noting that the rhombohedral morphology produced resembles closely that of sample CC#2, obtained in the absence of any IL (Figure 4.1.2 (c)).\n\u25a0 ILB\u00bb300 \u2022\nFigure 4.1.7.

C - calcite.\nThe occurrence of microframes in CC#3 and in particular microboxes in CC#5 are results of the utmost interest in the context of the development of hollow structures with foreseen application in drug delivery [20]. Considering that CC#3 and CC#5 were thoroughly washed with water (see Experimental section) we may draw a possible scenario for the formation of these two sorts of microstructures. If we assume that in both samples [Emim]Cl was essentially concentrated in the core of the growing microobjects, during washing leaching of the IL must have taken place to balance the ionic liquid chemical potential difference. The IL probably left the solid structure of the microcube through surface defects. At this stage the reason why microframes are not formed at high [Emim]Cl concentration is not clear.\nWhen an excess of (NH4)2CO3 was employed (C/Ca = 2.5) and a low concentration of [Emim]Cl was introduced, highly dispersed sphere/cocoon-shaped microaggregates of CC#7 (Figure 4.1.8 (a) and (b)), composed of a mixture of calcite (Figure 4.1.9) nanocubes and nanocorn-like objects (Figure 4.1.8 (c)) resulted at room temperature. At 9 \u00b0C, the size of these aggregates increased and their substructure became less regular. The XRD pattern of CC#8, reproduced in Figure 4.1.9, confirms that this sample contains NH4Cl besides calcite, a result that indicates that it was not possible to remove all the NH4Cl formed through washing.\nBiomimetic growth of calcium carbonate\n|\t193\nFigure 4.1.8.

C- calcite, F - fluorite, A1 - NH4Cl (01-089-2786).\n1\nWavenumber (cm )\nCaCO3 precipitation in the presence of [Bmim]Cl\nTo evaluate the consequences arising from the replacement of an ethyl group by a butyl group at position 1 of the imidazolium-based ILs, we incorporated [Bmim]Cl instead of [Emim]Cl in the reaction medium and carried out the synthesis of CaCO3 at room temperature, using a stoichiometric content of C:Ca and two different IL concentrations (Table 4.1.1).\nComparison of the morphology of sample CC#9 shown in Figures 4.1.10 (a) and (b) with that exhibited by sample CC#3 (Figures 4.1.5 (a) and (b)) demonstrates that at low [Bmim]Cl concentration the length of the alkyl substituent exerts a major effect. Although no microcubes or microframes are produced Figures 4.1.10 (a) and (b), the irregular calcite (Figure 4.1.11) objects formed in CC#9 show great resemblance with those exhibited by sample CC#5 (Figures 4.1.7 (a) and (b), also fabricated at room temperature, but at high [Emim]Cl concentration. Curiously, at higher [Bmim]Cl content, the morphology of the calcite (Figure 4.1.11) CC#10 sample (Figures 4.1.10 (c) and (d)) does not differ significantly from that displayed by CC#4 obtained at 9 \u00b0C and at a low [Emim]Cl concentration (Figures 4.1.5 (c) and (d))\nb\na\nFigure 4.1.10.

However, the calcite (Figure\n4.1.12)\tmicroboxes of CC#12 that emerge at higher [Bmpyr]Cl content (Figure 4.1.13 (c) and (d)) resemble those of sample CC#9 (Figure 4.1.10 (a) and (b)). Moreover, we note that the microboxes produced within the [Bmpyr]Cl-based solution at low content are similar to those of CC#5 (Figure 4.1.7 (a) and (b)), synthesized under the same conditions, but at high [Emim]Cl content. The tentative explanation given above for the formation of microboxes CC#5 should apply here too.\nIntensity (a.u.)\na C\tCC#12\t\t\n\t\tC\tp\tCC\nC \t\u00c1 .

These data lead us to conclude that there is in both series of samples a clear tendency for the formation of micro-aggregates. However, it seems that in the case of [Emim][BF4]-derived CC#13 and CC#14 materials this effect is favored: the size of the calcite (Figure 4.1.15) aggregates increases, although they become more irregular (Figure 4.1.14). In the case of sample CC#13 these aggregates are composed of a mixture of spherical particles (ca. 1 ^m diameter) and eroded rhomboedra (Figure 4.1.14 (b) of calcite, fluorite and two forms of NH4Cl (Figure 4.1.15). Figure 4.1.14 (b) demonstrates that the spherical micro-objects are nanostructured. Low temperature conditions yielded denser CC#14 aggregates of calcite, fluorite and a form of NH4Cl (Figure 4.1.15) where irregular microframes, microcubes and microspheres are visible (Figure 4.1.14 (f)).\nThe occurrence of fluorite in CC#13 and CC#14, both synthesized in the presence of BF4--based ILs (Table 4.1.1), suggests that in both samples the IL played the role of reactant. Clearly in the ethanolic reaction medium used, the BF4-ion released the fluoride ion (F-) .\n\nFigure 4.1.14.

Analysis of Figure 4.1.16 lead us to conclude that the presence of the terminal OH group has a dramatic effect on the morphology of the CaCO3 crystals.\nWhen [OHmim][BF4] was employed the sample obtained at room temperature (CC#15) was produced as shapeless aggregates (Figure 4.1.16 (a) considerably bigger that those found in sample CC#13 prepared with [Emim][BF4] (Figure 4.1.14 (a-c)). Sample CC#15 contains calcite, fluorite and two forms of NH4Cl (4.1.17). At 9 \u00b0C the aggregates of CC#16 that grow in the [OHmim][BF4] medium display a highly complex and intricate texture (Figure 4.1.16 (b)). According to Figure 4.1.17, the latter material only contains calcite and fluorite.\nFigure 4.1.16. SEM images of CaCO3 precipitated at room temperature (CC#15: (a)) and 9 \u00b0C (CC#16: (b)).

We have chosen methyl, ethyl, butyl and alcohol groups as substituents of the cationic rings.\nIrrespective of the chemical structure and concentration of the IL, of the reaction temperature and of the C:Ca ratio employed, the only polymorph found in all the CaCO3 samples synthesized was calcite. A second crystalline phase, fluorite, was formed only in the case of the samples synthesized in the presence of BF4--based ILs, an indication that these ILs played the role of reactants. Within the ethanolic medium employed the decomposition of the anion was induced, resulting in the formation of fluorite in parallel to the crystallization of calcite. In some of the samples a minor proportion of one or sometimes two forms of NH4Cl were detected, suggesting that the washing procedure was not always efficient. Performing crystallization at low temperature slowed down the precipitation process (cf. Experimental section).\nThe present work has illustrated the quite extraordinary ability of ILs to tune the morphology (i.e., shape and size) of CaCO3. Materials with a large variety of forms, ranging from microcubes, microframes and microboxes to nanocubes and nano-corn like objects, have been produced with the three Cl--based ILs. Interestingly, the addition of BF4--based ILs has generated hierarchically structured materials, displaying considerably more complex shapes, such as nanostructured microspheres, nanostructure jar-like micro-objects and ice-cream ball-like micro-objects.\nThe encouraging results derived from the present investigation justify further studies. Clearly, the production of calcite microboxes as promising drug carriers must be explored in more detail, using other washing methods, such as for instance, dialysis. Monitoring of dialysis progression with time may provide useful information about the transformation of microcubes, to microboxes and ultimately to microframes. Other\n4.1.2.\tReferences\n1.\tM.

In this context the production of CaCO3 crystals assisted by surfactants has emerged as an attractive strategy to control polymorphism and crystal orientation [111]. Most of the research in this domain has involved the use of cationic or anionic surfactants or mixtures of both. A reduced number of reports deal with the use of nonionic surfactants. Amphiphilic polymers, such as poly(oxyethylene)-poly(oxypropylene-poly(oxyethylene) (POE-POP-POE) block copolymers (commercially known as Pluronics), fall into the latter category of surfactants. Yan et al. [12] concluded that the mixture of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate with Pluronic127 in ethanol/water solution favored the formation of vaterite. Xie et al. [13] precipitated calcite and vaterite with low and high poly(ethylene glycol) concentration, respectively.\nIn the present work we have examined the influence of three different nonionic surfactants on the structure, shape and size of precipitated CaCO3 crystals. The compounds, which belong to the class of fatty alcohols, have been represented by the notation CnOH, with n = 14, 16 and 22 (Scheme 4.2.1). The crystallization of CaCO3 has been performed using the straightforward method proposed by Lee et al. [14], which implies the use of ethanol as the reaction medium, calcium chloride (CaCl2) as the source of calcium and ammonium carbonate ((NH4)2CO3) and the source of CO2. This method is suitable because does not require the control of the pH or the addition of additives.\n4.2.2.\tExperimental part\nMaterials\nCalcium chloride dihydrate (CaCl2.2H2O, Panreac), ammonium carbonate ((NH4)2CO3, Riedel-de Haen, purissim.), 1-tetradecanol (C44OH, Aldrich, 97%), 1-hexadecanol (C16OH, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), 1-docasanol (C22OH, Aldrich, 98%) were used as received. Ethanol (Merck, PA grade) was stored over molecular sieves prior to being used.

Chemical structures of the surfactants employed.\nSynthesis of the materials\nThe procedure used to precipitate CaCO3 has been described in detail in section\n4.2.1.\tThe samples prepared, in the different experimental conditions, are listed in table 4.2.1. The characterization of the samples by HR-SEM, XRD and FT-IR was done with the same conditions as described in section 4.1.\nTable 4.2.1.

Figures 4.2.1 (a-c) shows that at room temperature and low surfactant concentration, the rhombohedral shape is preserved in the dispersed aggegates of CC#1. However, upon increasing the chain length of the surfactant, the aggregates formed become larger and more irregular (CC#2 (Figures 4.2.1 (d-f) and CC#3 (Figures 4.2.1 (g-i)). Concomitantly, the rhombohedra observed in these aggregates become smaller and less abundant. Figures 4.2.1 (a), 4.2.1 (d) and 4.2.1 (e). In CC#1 and CC#2 calcite coexists with traces of a form of NH4Cl, an indication that it was not possible to remove all the NH4Cl formed through washing (Figure 4.2.2 (a)). In contrast in CC#3 calcite was the sole crystalline phase detected (Figure 4.2.2). The FT-IR spectra represented in Figure 4.2.2 (b) exhibit the characteristic absorption bands of calcite at 875 and 713 cm-1, ascribed to the v2(CO32-) mode (due to carbonate out-of-plane bending vibration) and v4(CO32-) mode (due to in-plane bending vibration), respectively [15]. The origin of the shoulders detected in the high-frequency side of the v4(CO32-) band of CC#3 is unknown.\nCEMUP\nFigure 4.2.1.

C - calcite and A2 - NH4Cl.\nInfluence of the C/Ca molar ratio\nFigures 4.2.3 (a-c) demonstrate that when an excess of (NH4)2CO3 was employed (C/Ca = 2.5), while maintaining a low concentration of Ci6OH, the morphology changed dramatically (cf. CC#2 in Figures 4.2.1 (d-f)). In CC#4, perfect submicrometer cubes (Figure 4.2.3(c)) assemble forming interconnected microspheres (Figures 4.2.3 (a) and (b)) of variable size. The objects formed are composed of calcite, although NH4Cl was also detected (Figure 4.2.4 (a)).\nCEMUP a\nCEMUP6\nFigure 4.2.3. SEM images of CaCO3 precipitated at room temperature (CC#4).

C - calcite and A2 - NH4Cl.\nInfluence of the reaction temperature\nWhen a low concentration of Ci6OH and a stoichiometric C:Ca molar ratio was used, but CaCO3 precipitation was carried out at 9 \u00b0C, calcite (Figure 4.2.4) aggregates smaller (Figure 4.2.5 (a)) than those of CC#2 (Figure 4.2.1 (d)) were obtained. Moreover in CC#5 the rhombohedra that form these aggregates are also smaller (Figure 4.2.5 (b)) than those produced at room temperature (Figure 4.2.1 (f)).\nFigure 4.2.5. SEM images of CaCO3 precipitated at 9 \u00b0C (CC#5). Molar ratio C/Ca \u00ab 1 and\nSurf/Ca \u00ab 0.08.\nInfluence of the surfactant concentration\nWith a stoichiometric molar ratio of C:Ca and a high C16OH content, calcite (Figure 4.2.6) aggregates of CC#6 composed of a mixture of microcubes and microboxes (red arrows in Figures 4.2.7 (a) and (b)) with regular, plate-like faces were precipitated at room temperature. At lower temperature the aggregates of CC#7 became shapeless and irregular (Figures 4.2.7 (a) and (b)). The presence of microboxes in CC#6 makes this sample potentially attractive as drug carrier [16].\nThese findings differ significantly from those observed at lower C16OH concentration both at room temperature in CC#2 (Figures 4.2.1 (d-f)) and at low temperature in CC#5 (Figure 4.2.5).\nFigure 4.2.6. PXRD patterns (a) and FT-IR spectra (b) of CaCO3 precipitated at room temperature (CC#6) and 9 \u00b0C (CC#7). Molar ratios C/Ca \u00ab 1 and Surf/Ca \u00ab 0.16.\nWavenumber (cm'1)\nThe formation of microboxes in CC#6 may be associated with the fact that the surfactant was probably located in the core of the growing crystals. During the washing procedure leaching of the surfactant must have occurred through surface defects.\nWe must note, however, that some molecules of surfactant must have remained bonded to the calcite crystals. This conclusion derives from the fact that practically all the PXRD patterns recorded included peaks ascribed to the surfactant employed in each case. In particular we draw the attention to the PXRD patterns of CC#4 (Figure 4.2.4 (a)) and CC#6 (Figure 4.2.6 (a)) where the occurrence of this effect is clearly evident.\nIt is of interest to refer at this stage that fatty alcohols exhibit a polymorphic behavior which has been known for a long time [17-22]. In 1960 Abrahamsson et al. [19] reported an orthorhombic low temperature phase for odd alcohols and two different forms for even alcohols (between dodecanol and eicosanol) depending on the temperature: a hexagonal high\nFigure 4.2.7.

In the literature it is possible to find some studies reporting the polymorphic behavior of fatty alcohols: 1-heptadecanol (C47H35OH), 1-octadecanol (C48H37OH), 1-nonadecanol (C49H39OH)) and 1-eicosanol (C20H44OH) [21]. The even n-alkanols (C48H37OH) and (C20H44OH) are isostructural at 298 K with the molecules in an all-trans conformation presenting a different behavior if compared with the odd alcohols ((C17H35OH) and (C19H39OH)) [21].\n4.2.4.\tConclusion\nIn the present work we have investigated the crystallization of CaCO3 from CaCl2 and (NH4)2CO3, in ethanolic solution, in the presence of three different fatty alcohols that acted as non-ionic surfactants. Independently of the experimental conditions considered, calcite was the sole polymorph formed. In general, objects with more irregularities were obtained at low temperature. With the three surfactants employed rhombohedra were obtained in practically all the reaction conditions. The only exceptions were the microspheres composed of microcubes produced at room temperature, high molar ratio C/Ca and low surfactant concentration, as well as the microboxes obtained at room temperature, using a stoichiometric molar ratio C/Ca and a high surfactant concentration.\n4.2.5.\tReferences\n1.\tH.

Representation of comercial poly(vinyl)pirrolidone (PVP)\nIts biomedical applications have been known for many years [2], for example as a blood plasma substitute and extender, and the corresponding ability to bind to certain drugs [3], dyes and toxins have been explored. More recently [4] an engineered in vitro process was reported which allows enamel recristallization and dentine tubule occlusion. It involves the use of metastable calcium fosfate/polymer hydrogels produced in situ on acid-etched dental hard tissues by hydration of electrospun mats of amorphous calcium pohosphate/PVP in fluoride containing saliva solution.\nThe interaction of PVP with surfactants has been also reported in the literature [5]. Mixtures of PVP with surfactants have been proposed as a medium to promote the crystallization of CaCO3 [1, 6-8]. The PVP dispersing capability for the solid particles, as well the mechanical stirring, prevents the direct precipitation of CaCO3 [7]. Depending on the surfactant employed and on the surfactant concentration [6], several polymorphs and morphologies were obtained. Wei et. al [8]. found that the crystallization of CaCO3 in a certain amount of PVP (1 mg/L) in the presence of a low amount of sodium sodecylsulfonate (DDS) the polymorph obtained was calcite with a\nrhombohedral shape and ca. 5 Lim of dimension, but when they increased the concentration of surfactant, keeping the same amount of PVP, they obtained a mixture of rhombohedra and a flower-shape objects. The same group reported the change of calcite to vaterite in the presence of PVP and sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS), with an increasing amount of surfactant [8]. To evaluate the influence of the polymer in the precipitation process of CaCO3 the same authors carried out a study in the presence/absence of PVP at various incubation times [1]. After ten minutes they observed the appearance of vaterite. Two main conclusions could be drawn: (1) The presence of PVP had no influence on the polymorphs obtained, but for higher concentration of PVP the morphologies of calcite and vaterite could be changed [1]. (2) The weak affinity between PVP molecules and Ca2+ ions, together with the high colloidstabilizing ability of PVP made it clear that before the transformation from ACC to crystalline phases, CaCO3 aggregated into bigger spherulites [1].\nIn the present work we decided to use a different experimental method [9] and employ PVP with different molecular weight in order to inhibit the crystallization of CaCO3 for a longer time, in an attempt to optimize the conditions that maintain CaCO3 in the amorphous form (ACC).\nVarious organisms use CaCO3 as a constituent of their skeleton, as protective shell or as optical medium [10,11]. ACC is widely found in biological organisms as temporary storage site for calcium and carbonate [12]. Because of its in-growth rate, immunogenicity and mechanical strength of the grown bones, biogenic CaCO3 is an attractive candidate for bone replacement/regeneration. A considerable amount of research done on materials for prostheses/implants has used biomimetic and/or bioinspired approaches to develop new biomaterials with improved performance\nIn the present work ACC crystallisation process was monitored over a long period of time right after ACC synthesis using standard techniques, such as X-ray Diffraction, FT-IR, Scanning Electronic Microscopy and Polarized Optical Microscopy [13].\n4.3.2.\tExperimental part\nMaterials\nCalcium chloride di-hydrated (CaCl2.2H2O, Panreac, PA-ACS, 147,02 g/mol), ammonium carbonate ((NH4)2CO3, Riedel de Haen, purissim), ethanol absolute (Panreac, PA) and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP, Mw~70 000, Across) were used as received.\nSynthesis of the materials\nThe general method employed in the preparation of the samples was mentioned in section 4.2.1. PVP was dissolved in the ethanolic solution of CaCl2.2H2O (Scheme 4.3.2). After approximately one year selected samples were washed by centrifugation in the way described in section 4.2.1..\nScheme 4.3.2. Representation of the experimental procedure employed.\nTable 4.3.1. shows the appropriate amounts of compounds involved in the preparation of the samples as a function of time. For the sake of simplicity, we decided to divide the samples under study in three groups: Without template (I), 500-100 mg range of PVP (II) and 50-10 mg range of PVP (III).\n\t\tMass of CaCl2 (g)\tMol CaCl2\tMass of NH4(CO3)2 (g)\tMol NH4(CO3)2\tMass of PVP (mg)\nI\tCC#0\t1.48\t0.01\t1.99\t0.02\t0\nII\tCC#500\t1.48\t0.01\t1.98\t0.02\t500\n\tCC#300\t1.48\t0.01\t1.94\t0.02\t300\n\tCC#100\t1.48\t0.01\t1.92\t0.02\t100\nIII\tCC#50\t1.48\t0.01\t1.95\t0.02\t50\n\tCC#25\t1.48\t0.01\t1.93\t0.02\t25\n\tCC#10\t1.50\t0.01\t1.94\t0.02\t10\nCharacterization of the materials\nThe experimental procedures (equipments and methods) were already described in section 2.1 for Fourier Transform Infra-Red Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Polarized Optical Microscopy (POM) and in section 3.1 for X-ray diffraction.\nTo examine the morphology of the samples two different equipments were employed. To check the evolution of the samples as function of time a SEM/ESEM-FEI Quanta 400 equipment operating at a high acceleration voltage (25 kV) was employed. To access the final morphology a FEI Quanta 400 FEG ESEM / EDAXS Pegasus x44 was used. All the samples were coated with Au/Pd.\nWe note that the samples were analyzed by different techniques with small delays between each technique.\n4.3.2.\tResults and discussion\nI- Without template\nFigure 4.3.1 shows the XRD patterns of samples prepared without any template recorded as function of time. The appearance in the first hour (1h) of residual peaks at\n22.9\tand 29.4\u00b0 suggest the presence of calcite (C), whereas the peak at 32.6\u00b0 indicates the presence of vaterite (V). These peaks remain during the first month (1m) of\nXRD pattern corresponding to the first day (1d).\nc c\nV\n\u25a1\nc\n10\t15\t20\t25\t30\n\u201cI\n35\n2e (0)\nFigure 4.3.1. XRD patterns of the sample without template as function of time. On the right side it is possible to observe the SEM Images corresponding to the sample after one hour (bottom) and one day (top)\nThe corresponding SEM images are represented in Figure 4.3.1. After one hour the SEM image (bottom of Figure 4.3.1) exhibits an heterogeneous aspect composed of elongated objects that end-up with spherical aggregates. No specific morphologies can be detected and the same applies to the SEM image recorded after 1 day.\nThe POM image, represented in Figure 4.3.2, was obtained between crossed polarizers after 4 days. This technique is a useful tool to monitor the development of the crystallinity [13]. It reveals birefringence corresponding to the anisotropic character of the sample.\nFigure 4.3.2. POM image recorded between crossed polarizers of the sample prepared without any template.\nThe XRD pattern obtained on the first day does not display any peak. However a close analysis of different regions of the FT-IR spectrum (Figure 4.3.3) reveals the presence of aragonite, represented by the shoulder at 1080 cm-1 (Figure 4.3.3 (a)) and the band at 700 cm-1 (Figure 4.3.2 (c)) [14, 15]. In fact the presence of aragonite was detected by FTIR since the first hour (Figure 4.3.3 (a) and (c)). The evolution of the system to calcite/vaterite after the 4th day was clearly manifested in the FT-IR spectra by the shift of the band from 700 cm-1 up to 710 cm-1 (Figure 4.3.3 (c) and the presence of the band at 875 cm-1 (Figure 4.3.3 (b)).\n(a)\nAbsorbance (a.u.)\n96h\n24h\n4h\n1100\t1080\t1060\t1040\t1020\t1000\nWavenumber (cm-1)\nWavenumber (cm-1)\tWavenumber (cm-1)\nFigure 4.3.3.

The POM and SEM images were recorded simultaneously.\nAccording to the XRD data obtained in the first hour, all the samples remain amorphous (Figure 4.3.4 (a-c)). After 24 hours the first peaks of polymorphs with different morphologies start to appear, more specifically, the peaks corresponding to vaterite (27.97 and 32.7\u00b0). This result is more evident in the samples with a high and low amount of polymer (Figure 4.3.4 (a) and (c) respectively). The POM image in the bottom of Figure 4.3.4, obtained after one day between crossed-polarizers, shows the characteristic needle-like shapes which confirm the presence of vaterite in the 100 mg PVP-based sample [13]. After two days, the POM image, obtained for the same sample and with the same conditions, reveals the presence of the rhombohedra shapes associated with calcite (Figure 4.3.4 top) [14]. The latter result is in good agreement with XRD, since the pattern (Figure 4.3.4 (c)) shows the 29\u00b0 calcite peak after the second day and until the last analysis made for the sample with 100 mg of polymer (Figure 4.3.4 (c)). The presence of a peak suggesting the formation of vaterite is observed from the first up to the third day.\nIn the case of the sample with 200 mg of PVP, the calcite peak at 29.4\u00b0 appear just after two weeks (Figure 4.3.4 (b)). In fact, for this amount of polymer and in five months of analysis the presence of calcite was not easy to detect by this technique. In contrast, the presence of vaterite is easily identified because of the existence of a peak located at 33\u00b0 (Figure 4.3.4 (b)).\nFor the sample with the highest amount of PVP the presence of vaterite is revealed by the appearance of the corresponding peak (33\u00b0) after one day. This peak remains present for 21 days (Figure 4.3.4 (a)). Due to the evolution of the mechanical properties of the samples, the XRD analysis from the 5th month were very difficult to perform (Figure 4.3.4 (b)), suggesting that the samples were amorphous, a conclusion which was not confirmed by FT-IR spectroscopy.

The main goal was to check the reproducibility of the experiments, but unfortunately, as expected, the resulting data were not reproducible. We tried to perform the analyses within the same time intervals, but sometimes this was not possible. As it was reported in the first range of concentrations studied, the absence or presence of the different polymorphous by XRD and FTIR is not always in agreement.\nFor the sample prepared with 50 mg of PVP the XRD results obtained are displayed in Figure 4.3.6 (a) and the FTIR data in Figures 4.3.6 (b) and (c). According to the XRD pattern (Figure 4.3.6 (a)) the first peak on the XRD pattern crystallites, visible after 48 hours, is located at 32.8\u00b0 (vaterite). Small traces at 29\u00b0 (calcite) are seen too. In the corresponding FT-IR spectra the 875 cm-1 band characteristic of calcite is evident after four hours, but the 715 cm-1 band also characteristic of calcite is observable just after three days.\nThe POM images recorded between crossed polarizer (Figure 4.3.7) beautifully demonstrates the amorphous character of the sample after 4 hours (Figure 4.3.7 (a) [14] and the presence of needles of aragonite after one day (Figure 4.3.7 (b))\n(a)\t(b)\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t&amp;\u00edl tuso\t\t(Mtm\u00fc)\nFigure 4.3.7. POM images obtained between crossed polarizers for the sample prepared with\n50 mg of PVP after 4 hours (a) and one day (b).\nThe XRD patterns of the sample prepared with 25 mg of PVP are reproduced in\nFigure 4.3.8 (a). In all the analyses just small peaks were discerned, the presence of\ncrystallites being observed after 2 days. The 900-940 cm-1 (Figure 4.3.8 (b)) and 770690 cm\u20191 (Figure 4.3.8 (c)) regions of the FTIR spectra, i.e. confirm the presence of calcite after 4 days, because of the occurrence of its characteristic bands. In the FTIR region represented in Figure 4.3.8 (c) it is possible to observe the band at 698 cm-1 corresponding to aragonite [14] on the first and second days of analysis. No such information is retrieved, however, from the XRD pattern (Figure 4.3.8 (a)).\nThe sample prepared with 10 mg of PVP produced the same kind of XRD patterns (Figure 4.3.9 (a)), with small crystallites appearing all over the period of analysis. In the FTIR spectra the most relevant feature is the band at 865 cm-1, corresponding to the v2 mode of carbonate and characteristic of ACC [15]. It is observed after two days (Figure 4.3.9 (b)). In the same period of time aragonite (700 cm-1, v4 mode) and vaterite (738 cm-1, v4 mode) are also detected. The presence of aragonite after two days is confirmed by POM (Figure 4.3.10) which displays the characteristic needles associated with this polymorph.After four days the presence of calcite is indicated by the bands at 875 cm-1 and 715 cm-1 (Figure 4.3.9 (b-c)).\nFigure 4.3.10.

The washed samples present a well-defined texture over the whole range of PVP concentrations considered. Figures 4.3.12 (a-c) show that after one year the samples exist under the form of aggregates. Irrespetively of PVP concentration, all the aggregates are composed of nonocorn-like objects.\nFigure 4.3.12.

The different experiences were monitored from the first hour. In the case of the samples prepared with low amount of polymer the study was extended to one year.\nDuring this work some difficulties in the attribution of the correct polymorph present were evident, due to the different information retrieved from the techniques employed. FT-IR spectroscopy is a more powerful technique giving the first clear indication of the appearance of vaterite and the interval time that is necessary for its transformation to calcite. Is also the only technique that allowed us to identified the presence or aragonite.\nThe long-time inhibition of the growth of crystalline CaCO3 was not achieved. The growth of crystalline forms took longer when low amounts of PVP were employed (50-25 mg of PVP). In particular, aragonite, together with small traces of vaterite, were detected after two days for the sample prepared with 10 mg of PVP and after one day for the sample prepared with 20 mg of PVP.\nAlthough the main goal of this work was not completely achieved, the analyses performed after one year demonstrated that the polymorph formed for all the samples under analysis calcite, presented dimensions in the nanometric range, suggesting that PVP did not affect polymer selectivity, but influenced the size of the calcite crystals.\n2.3.5.\tReferences\n1.\tH.

All the chapters have in common the fact that they deal with organic-inorganic materials differing from each other in the methodology employed in their preparation. The motivation on the preparation of each family of compounds, as well the main conclusions drawn from their study is reported in the corresponding sections.\nThe advantages of combining the sol-gel method and self-assembly techniques were discussed in Chapter 2. All the materials reported in this Chapter were based on this synthetic strategy.\nIn section 2.1 a hybrid silica prepared through acidic hydrolysis/condensation of the (EtO)3Si(CH2)3NHC(=O)NH(CH2)i2NHC(=O)NH(CH2)3Si(OEt)3 (P12) precursor using a water/DMSO mixture was proposed. The final morphology of the lamellar silsesquioxane produced from the (P12) was changed from rigid platelets obtained in the lamellar hybrid (L12) to micro-objects that resemble sea sponges (L12D) upon simple mixing with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The microstructural modifications observed were ascertained by several techniques. A mechanism for the morphology tuning based on the polarity of the solvent mixture was proposed. The results reported here represent an important step forward in the comprehension of the processes governing the formation of self-organized hybrid siliceous materials and highlight that the nature of the solvent plays a major role on the shaping of the final material. This conclusion was of particular importance in the preparation of some other materials studied in the Chapter 2.\nIn particular, DMSO and an excess of water were employed in the preparation, through the combination of self-directed assembly and an acid-catalyzed sol-gel route, of di-urea cross-linked bridged silsesquioxanes (BSs) C10CnC10 derived from organosilane precursors including decylene chains as side spacers and alkylene chains with variable length as central spacers (EtO)3Si-(CH2)10-Y-(CH2)n-Y-(CH2)10-Si(OEt)3 (n = 7, 9-12; Y = urea group and Et = ethyl). This new family of hybrids, discussed in section Conclusions and perspectives futures\t| 247\n2.2,\tenabled us to conclude that the length of the side spacers plays a unique role in the structuring of alkylene-based BSs, although their morphology remains unaffected. All the samples adopt a lamellar structure. While the alkylene chains are totally disordered in the case of the C10C7C10 sample, a variable proportion of all-trans and gauche conformers exist in the materials with longer central spacers. The highest degree of structuring occurs for n = 9. The inclusion of decylene instead of propylene chains as side spacers leads to the formation of a stronger hydrogen-bonded urea-urea array. The emission spectra and emission quantum yields of the C10CnC10 materials are similar to those reported for di-urea cross-linked alkylene-based BSs incorporating propylene chains as side spacers and prepared under different experimental conditions. The emission of the C10CnC10 hybrids was ascribed to the overlap of two distinct components that occur within the urea cross-linkages and within the siliceous nanodomains. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy provided evidence that the average distance between the siliceous domains and the urea cross-links is similar in the C10CnC10 BSs and in oxyethylene-based hybrid analogues incorporating propylene chains as side spacers (di-ureasils), an indication that the longer side chains in the former materials adopt gauche conformations. It also allowed us to demonstrate for the first time that the emission features of the urea-related component of the emission of alkylene-based BSs depend critically on the length of the side spacers.\nIn section 2.3 a novel family of silsesquioxanes were prepared using as organic precursors three fatty alcohols (CYOH) of variable length. These compounds are suitable because the reaction of the terminal OH group with the isocyanate group of ICPTES gives rise to the urethane linkage. This new family of compounds were designated by mono-alkyl urethanesils (m-Ut(CY)). A first group of samples was prepared under acidic conditions (ac) and in the presence of a large excess of water to study the influence of the chain length giving origin to the m-Ut(CY)-ac group of samples. In the m-Ut(CY)-ac compounds with Y = 14, 16 and 22 the chains adopt preferentially all-trans conformations, revealing an ordered structure. For Y = 16 the conformational changes to which the chains are subject during heating and cooling cycles were evaluated by means of DSC and FT-IR. These analyses were fundamental, since all the m-Ut(CY)-ac samples undergo order/disorder phase transitions. During the cooling cycle of m-Ut(C16)-ac the FT-IR data exhibit hysteresis. Unlike in m-A(14),\nthe order/disorder phase transition, although reversible, is not apparently timedependent. The emission quantum yields are of the same order of magnitude of that reported for the parent mono-amidosil compound.\nThe chain length corresponding to Y = 16 was also chosen to investigate the influence of the solvent in the structuring of the samples. Several experimental changes were introduced in the synthetic procedure (being represented by @ax where x = 1, 2 or 3). A second group of materials emerged: m-Ut(CY)@ax. The experimental changes did not affect structurally the m-Ut(CY)@ax samples with x = 1 and 2. All the materials exhibit a lamellar bilayer nanostructure. The m-Ut(CY)@a3 differs markedly from all the other samples. It displays order at shorter range and it is clear that its structure deserves to be studied in the near future in more depth. In terms of morphology the two series of mono-alkyl urethanesils are very attractive. We draw the attention in particular to the complex unique textures observed in m-Ut(C16)-ac and m-Ut(C22)-ac (\"cabbage-like\" and \u201cdesert rose-like\u201d, respectively) and in ac Ut(CY)@a3 (\"origami-like\").\nDuring the study of these materials many other questions were raised, related with the preparation and characterization of the samples. In terms of preparation should be interesting, for example, to inspect in the future:\n\u2022\tThe influence of different ratios H2O / HCl / DMSO in different steps of reaction\n\u2022\tThe possibility of obtaining materials starting from fatty alcohols with other chain lengths or with chains comprising an odd number of carbons\n\u2022\tThe possibility of incorporating lanthanide ions, or other cations in order to create/enlarge the range of applications\nIn terms of characterization it will be mandatory to characterize thermally the m-Ut(CY)@ax samples in order to check the existence of order/disorder phase transitions. Based on the systems answer to the thermal characterization many other techniques as function of temperature could be employed.\nIn Chapter 3 the sol-gel method was employed to prepare two series of diurethane cross-linked poly(s-caprolactone) (PCL(530))/siloxane ormolytes doped with potassium triflate (section 3.1) and a mixture of lithium triflate / europium triflate\n(section 3.2). As stated before (PCL stands for the poly(s-caprolactone) biopolymer and 530 is the average molecular weight in gmol-1 (d-PCL(530)/siloxane)\nIn section 3.1 the KCF3SO3-doped di-urethane cross-linked poly(s-caprolactone) system was studied with different concentrations of salt. The concentration was represented by n, being n the number of (C(=O)(CH2)5O) repeat units per K+ ion. In the present work we analyzed xerogels with n =\t200, 100, 40 29, 21, 10, 4, 2, 1 and 0.5.\nOrmolyte samples with n > 1 are thermally stable up to 235 \u00b0C. A minor proportion of PCL crystallites occur in some dilute-to-concentrated samples. At n &lt;4 a crystalline\\ PCL(530)/siloxane-KCF3SO3 complex with unknown stoichiometry emerges. At n &lt;2 this complex coexists with pure salt. At temperatures higher than 40 \u00b0C the composition which exhibits the highest ionic conductivity is n = 21. \"Free\" anions, weakly coordinated CF3SO3- ions, contact ion pairs and several higher ionic aggregates emerge in all the samples. The K+ ions bond to the oxygen atoms of the carbonyl groups of the urethane and ester groups, of the PCL (530) ether chain and of the triflate ions at all salt concentrations. The ormolytes were successfully used in the production of prototype electrochromic devices (ECDs) that exhibit low switching time and good open circuit memory. The ECD incorporating the ormolyte with n = 21 displayed an average transmittance in the visible region of ca. 55 % in the colored state and 76 % in the bleached state\nIn section 3.2. the sol-gel process was successfully combined with the \"mixed cation\" effect to produce novel luminescent and ion conducting biohybrids composed of a d-PCL(530)/siloxane doped with a wide range of concentrations of lithium and europium triflates (LiCF3SO3 and Eu(CF3SO3)3, respectively) (molar ratio of ca. 50:50). The hybrid samples are all semi-crystalline: while at n = 52.6 and 27.0 (n, composition, corresponds to the number of (C(=O)(CH2)5O) repeat units of PCL(530) per mixture of Li+ and Eu3+ ions) a minor proportion of crystalline PCL(530) chains is present, at n = 6.1 a new crystalline phase emerges. The latter electrolyte is thermally stable up to 220 \u00b0C and exhibits the highest conductivity over the entire range of temperatures studied (3.7x10-7 and 1.71x10-4 Scm-1 at 20 and 102 \u00b0C, respectively). According to infrared spectroscopic data, major modifications occur in terms of hydrogen bonding interactions at this composition. The electrochemical stability domain of the biohybrid sample with n = 27 spans about 5.5 V versus Li/Li+. This sample is a room temperature\nwhite light emitter. Its emission color can be easily tuned across the Commission Internationale d'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity diagram upon simply changing the excitation wavelength. Preliminary tests performed with a prototype electrochromic device (ECD) comprising the sample with n = 6.1 as electrolyte and WO3 as cathodically coloring layer are extremely encouraging. The device exhibits switching time around 50 s, an optical density change of 0.15, good open circuit memory under atmospheric conditions (ca. 1 month) and high coloration efficiency (576 cm2C-1).\nThe results obtained in this Chapter encourage us to explore the possibility of incorporating different salts or ionic liquids into d-PCL(530)/siloxane bio-hibrid in order to increase the conductivity of the materials and enlarge the applications on prototype ECDs.\nChapter 4 concerns biomineralization and the concept of organic inorganic materials are slightly different from that applied in Chapters 2 and 3. These studies involved the formation of calcium carbonate in laboratory scale through the use of different templates that tuned the characteristic morphologies of CaCO3. The possibility of inhibiting the crystalline forms of CaCO3 was investigated using poly(vinylpyrrolidone) as inhibitor. Unfortunattely the amorphous form of CaCO3 was not kept longer than two days, which motivates us to continue exploring the optimal conditions necessary to retard the growth of crystalline forms and allow the further application of ACC for instance in the orthopedic field.\nIn section 4.1 the influence of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium chloride, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate and 1-ethanol-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ILs on the morphology and structure of CaCO3 was investigated in ethanolic medium using calcium chloride and ammonium carbonate as calcium and carbon sources, respctively. The syntheses were carried out at 9 \u00b0C and room temperature, at different IL concentrations and different C:Ca molar ratio.\nNo polymorph selectivity was detected, calcite being the only crystalline form obtained under all the reactions conditions considered. In the case of the BF4--based ILs, anion decomposition occurred, leading to the formation of fluorite. Low temperature induced a reduction of the precipitation rate.\nWith the ILs used the morphology of CaCO3 was finely tailored. Calcite microcubes, microframes and microboxes, with potential application in drug delivery, as well as nanocubes and nano-corn like objects, have been produced with Cl--based ILs. With BF4--based ILs, hierarchically structured materials, in which calcite coexists with fluorite, complex and intricate shapes have been produced, such as nanostructured microspheres, nanostructure jar-like micro-objects and ice-cream balllike micro-objects.\nIn section 4.2 the same methodology with the same goals was employed in the preparation of other class of materials. But instead of ionic liquids were employed as templates the same fatty alcohols used in section 2.3 in the preparation of the monoalkyl urethanesil samples.\nOnce again no polymorph selectivity was detected, calcite being the only crystalline form obtained under all the reactions conditions considered. The rombohedral shape of calcite was the major form found in the experiences carried out.\nIn section 4.3 the major goal was not completely achieved, but the analysis after one year demonstrated that the polymorph formed for all the samples under analysis, calcite, presented dimensions in the nanometric range, suggesting that PVP did not affect polymer selectivity, but influenced the size of calcite crystals.\nAppendix A\nResume en frangais\nIntroduction\nPour une bonne comprehension des travaux exposes ci-dessous, des concepts de base doivent etre rappeles dans un premier temps.\nLa chimie des materiaux occupe une place importante a I'interface de la chimie, de la physique et de la biologie. Les reactions chimiques permettent la formation de nouveaux materiaux qui sont caracterises par des techniques physiques. L'inspiration par la Nature est une constante [1-3]. Beaucoup d'idees viennent de la Nature, ce qui donne lieu a des materiaux bio-inspires, aussi appeles materiaux biomimetiques. Les materiaux naturels presentent un haut degre de sophistication, de miniaturisation (ils contiennent un maximum de fonctions elementaires dans un petit volume) realisant un compromis entre les differentes proprietes ou fonctions [2]. Ils montrent une complexite et une structure hierarchique entre les echelles nanometriques, micrometriques et millimetriques. Les proprietes de la plupart des materiaux dependent de leur echelle [2] et de leur forme [4, 5].\nUn des buts principaux de la science des materiaux consiste en la production de materiaux a structuration hierarchique qui sont organises a differentes echelles. Les approches du bas vers le haut (bottom-up) et du haut vers le bas (top-down) sont employees dans la production de nanomateriaux. La strategie bottom-up emploie des processus chimiques comme le sol-gel.\nL'importance de la production de materiaux hybrides organiques-inorganiques\n[6]\ta structure hierarchique et morphologie controlee par l'emploi des techniques solgel [7] et de l'auto-assemblage [8] a ete demontree.\nLe procede sol-gel a aussi ete employe pour preparer des materiaux bio-hybrides organiques-inorganiques dopes utilises comme couche conductrice dans des prototypes de dispositifs electrochrome, afin d'illustrer les applications potentielles des materiaux sol-gel.\nIl est possible de trouver dans la Nature des exemples d'approches bottom-up\ndans la production de biomineraux en conditions douces. Ces biomineraux sont des composites organiques-inorganiques qui ont des proprietes interessantes et des structures hierarchiques controlees. Beaucoup d'exemples d'organismes vivants\ncomportant des biomin\u00e9raux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rapport\u00e9s: dans les crustac\u00e9es [9-11], des cristaux intracellulaires dans les prokariotes, les exosquelettes des algues protozoa, les invert\u00e9br\u00e9s, les spicules [12, 13] et lentilles[14], les os, les dents, les statolithes et les otolithes, les coquilles d'reuf, les plantes ou les structures min\u00f3rales [15, 16]. Dans quelques exemples, les biomin\u00e9raux form\u00e9s sont si stables qu'ils ne pr\u00e9cipitent jamais dans les conditions ambiantes [12]. La biomin\u00e9ralisation [3] peut etre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un ph\u00e9nomene tres r\u00e9pandu dans la Nature, permettant la formation d'une grande vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de structures inorganiques solides par des organismes vivants.\nChapitre 2: Mat\u00e9riaux hybrides organiques-inorganiques obtenus par les techniques sol-gel et d'auto-assemblage\nCe chapitre est divis\u00e9 en trois sections, chacune correspondant a une famille diff\u00e9rente de mat\u00e9riaux. Ces mat\u00e9riaux ont en commun qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenus par le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 sol-gel en employant les techniques d'auto-assemblage, et qu'ils pr\u00e9sentent des structures hi\u00e9rarchiques avec des morphologies bien d\u00e9finies.\nLa premiere section est focalis\u00e9e sur l'\u00e9tude de l'influence du solvent sur la morphologie finale d'un silsesquioxane lamellaire produit a partir du pr\u00e9curseur P12 ((EtO)3Si(CH2)3NHC(=O)NH(CH2)12NHC(=O)NH(CH2)3Si(OEt)3).\tLes modifications\nstructurales observ\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies par diff\u00e9rentes techniques. Un m\u00e9canisme a \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9 pour expliquer la modification de la morphologie comme une cons\u00e9quence du changement de polarit\u00e9 du m\u00e9lange de solvants.\nDans la seconde section, des silsesquioxanes pont\u00e9s (BS) appel\u00e9s Ci0CnCi0 contenant des liens ur\u00e9e capables d'auto-assemblage ont \u00e9t\u00e9 synth\u00e9tis\u00e9s. Ils sont d\u00e9riv\u00e9s de pr\u00e9curseurs organosilanes ((EtO)3Si-(CH2)10-Y-(CH2)n-Y-(CH2)10-Si(OEt)3 (n = 7, 9-12; Y = fonction ur\u00e9e and Et = \u00e9thyle)) contenant des chames d\u00e9cylene comme espaceurs lat\u00e9raux, et des chames alkylene comme espaceurs centraux. Cette nouvelle famille de silices hybrides nous a permis de conclure que la longueur des espaceurs\nlateraux joue un role unique dans la structuration des BS a base d'alkylenes, bien que\nleur morphologie ne soit pas alt\u00e9r\u00e9e.\nLa troisieme section de ce chapitre s'int\u00e9resse a une nouvelle famille de mat\u00e9riaux hybrides a structuration hi\u00e9rarchique, appel\u00e9s mono-ur\u00e9thanesils, comportant des liens ur\u00e9thane form\u00e9s par la r\u00e9action d'une s\u00e9rie d'alcools (Cn H2n+1OH, avec n = 14, 16 et 22) avec le (3-isocyanatopropyl)tri\u00e9thoxysilane. Les effets du lien ur\u00e9thane et de la polarit\u00e9 du solvant sur la morphologie des \u00e9chantillons ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tudi\u00e9s, ainsi que la possibilit\u00e9 d'un comportement thermique hyst\u00e9r\u00e9tique.\n2.1.\tControle de la morphologie des silsesquioxanes lamellaires par le solvant : des plaquettes aux micro\u00e9ponges\nDans ce travail, nous avons pu produire un mat\u00e9riau hybride de type silsesquioxane pont\u00e9 a partir du pr\u00e9curseur P12 avec une morphologie totalement in\u00e9dite. La nouvelle m\u00e9thode de synthese adopt\u00e9e ici est une modification de celle employ\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment pour pr\u00e9parer le mat\u00e9riau L12, le seul changement introduit \u00e9tant l'incorporation d'un large exces de DMSO dans le milieu r\u00e9actionnel [17]. La pr\u00e9sence de ce solvant a induit la formation d'un mat\u00e9riau (appel\u00e9 L12D) avec une morphologie d'\u00e9ponge. Ce mat\u00e9riau L12D a \u00e9t\u00e9 synth\u00e9tis\u00e9 a partir d'un m\u00e9lange de P12, d'eau, de DMSO et de HCl avec un rapport molaire P12: DMSO: H2O: HCl = 1:388:527:0.175 a 80 \u00b0C. L12D a \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu sous la forme d'une poudre blanche apres filtration, lavages et lyophilisation. Le thermogramme ATG de L12D r\u00e9vele que ce mat\u00e9riau hybride est stable thermiquement jusqu'a 245 \u00b0C en atmosphere non oxydante. Le spectre RMN 29Si CP/MAS montre des signaux a -48, -57 et -67 ppm, attribu\u00e9es aux environnements T1 (C-Si(OSi)(OR)2), T2 (C-Si(OSi)2(OR)) et T3 (C-Si(OSi)3) du silicium, respectivement, avec R = H ou Et). Le degr\u00e9 de condensation c (ou c = 1/3 (%T1 + 2 %T2 + 3 %T3)) a \u00e9t\u00e9 estim\u00e9 a ca 71%. La similarit\u00e9 trouv\u00e9e entre cette valeur et celle rapport\u00e9e pour le mat\u00e9riau L12 [18-21] et d'autres alkylsiloxanes[22] suggere la\nformation d'un reseau siloxane 2D dans le silsesquioxane L12D, et par consequence I'existence d'un polymere lineaire de liaisons siloxanes malgre I'encombrement sterique significatif induit par les groupes alkyle. Le spectre RMN 13 C CP/MAS de L12D\npr\u00e9sente les pics escompt\u00e9s: les groups ur\u00e9e donnent un signal fin a 160 ppm (largeur\na mi-hauteur (fwhm) = 2,2 ppm), signaux faibles a 58 et 18 ppm correspondant a\nquelques fragments \u00e9thoxy r\u00e9siduels (CH3CH2-O and CH3CH2-O, respectivement), d\u00e9montrant que l'hydrolyse a \u00e9t\u00e9 quasi-complete, et les signaux associ\u00e9s aux fragments m\u00e9thylene internes entre 30 et 35 ppm. Le pic a 12 ppm typique des groupes CH2-Si est aussi pr\u00e9sent.\nLes clich\u00e9s de microscopie \u00e9lectronique a balayage (MEB) d\u00e9montrent que, a la diff\u00e9rence de L12 qui \u00e9tait obtenu sous la forme de plaquettes, L12D est produit sous la forme de spheres microm\u00e9triques de diametre compris entre 10 et 50 pm. Une plus grande amplification r\u00e9vele clairement que ces microspheres ont une morphologie d'\u00e9ponge qui consiste en des films tres fins repli\u00e9s et li\u00e9s les uns aux autres selon un assemblage cot\u00e9 contre face. L'existence de films recourb\u00e9s a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par microscopie \u00e9lectronique en transmission (MET). De fa^on int\u00e9ressante, L12D a un caractere anisotropique qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 par des clich\u00e9s de microscopie optique obtenus sous lumiere polaris\u00e9e (POM) entre polariseurs crois\u00e9s. La bi-r\u00e9fringence observ\u00e9e suggere une anisotropie a l'\u00e9chelle sous-microm\u00e9trique. Les images par microscopie a force atomique (AFM) enregistr\u00e9es en scannant la surface de L12D en mode de modulation d'amplitude, dit tapping, indiquent une organisation lamellaire. La p\u00e9riodicit\u00e9 discern\u00e9e dans les images 2D peut aussi etre observ\u00e9e a partir du profil. La comparaison des diffractogrammes de rayons X obtenus a partir de poudres de L12D et L12 indique que le trac\u00e9 de L12D est clairement moins bien r\u00e9solu que celui de L12. Le diffractogramme de L12D pr\u00e9sente trois pics principaux a 2,17, 6,52 et 8,72 nm-1 dans la r\u00e9gion des petits angles, correspondant aux premier, troisieme et quatrieme harmoniques d'une structure lamellaire avec une distance interlamellaire caract\u00e9ristique l (ou l = n 2n/qn, et n est l'ordre de r\u00e9flexion) de 2,85 nm. Dans la r\u00e9gion des grands angles, le pic a 13,0 nm-1 (d = 0,48 nm) est associ\u00e9 avec la s\u00e9paration entre deux groupes ur\u00e9e voisins dans le r\u00e9seau ur\u00e9e-ur\u00e9e auto-assembl\u00e9 par liaisons hydrogene [18, 19]; la bande large pro\u00e9minante a 15,1 nm-1 (d = 0,42 nm) est attribu\u00e9e a l'ordre dans les domaines siloxane [18, 19]. Le pic mal d\u00e9fini a 16,3 nm-1, mais aussi l'\u00e9paulement observ\u00e9 a 17,0 nm-1 (d = 0,39 et 0,37 nm, respectivement) donnent des informations sur la densit\u00e9 de l'empilement des chames et sur l'ordre dans les distances chafne-chafne dans le plan. Ce premier pic est associ\u00e9 avec les chames en conformation gauche, alors que le second est caract\u00e9ristique des chafnes en conformation all-trans (mieux empil\u00e9es, et donc plus proches) [18, 19]. Toutes les 256\t[\ndistances caract\u00e9ristiques dans L12D indiqu\u00e9es ci-dessus sont en parfait accord avec celles rapport\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment pour L12 [20].\nPour comprendre l'influence du DMSO sur la force des liaisons hydrogene, nous avons d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'\u00e9xaminer la signature spectrale de L12D dans la r\u00e9gion 1800-1500 cm-1 du spectre infrarouge a transform\u00e9e de Fourier (FT-IR) et de la comparer avec celle de L12. Cette r\u00e9gion spectrale est d'un tres grand int\u00e9ret, car c'est la que les modes de vibration amide I et amide II absorbent. Le mode amide I (1800-1600 cm-1) est essentiellement du aux vibrations d'\u00e9longation C=O [23]; il est sensible a la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 et a l'amplitude des liaisons hydrogene. Habituellement, la bande amide I consiste en plusieurs composants distincts qui correspondent a des aggr\u00e9gats ou environnements des C=O diff\u00e9rents [23, 24]. Le mode amide II (1600-1500 cm-1) est principalement associ\u00e9 a des vibrations de torsion dans le plan des groupes N-H, et est sensible a la fois aux conformations des chames et aux liaisons hydrogene intermol\u00e9culaires, donnant des informations pr\u00e9cieuses sur la distribution en intensit\u00e9 des liaisons hydrogene [23]. Une analyse plus pouss\u00e9e des profils des bandes de L12 et L12D r\u00e9vele qu'ils different de fa^on significative, comme cons\u00e9quence d'une redistribution des composantes. En effet, la proportion d'aggr\u00e9gats d\u00e9sordonn\u00e9s responsables de la composante a 1647 cm-1 [18] augmente dans L12D aux d\u00e9pens de la destruction des aggr\u00e9gats ordonn\u00e9s qui donnent la composante a 1625 cm-1 [18]. En cons\u00e9quence, la surface correspondant au composant amide II a 1564 cm-1 augmente, alors que celle a 1583 cm-1 diminue. Ces r\u00e9sultats sont en faveur de l'explication dans laquelle l'addition de DMSO dans le milieu r\u00e9actionnel a pour cons\u00e9quence la formation d'aggr\u00e9gats ur\u00e9e-ur\u00e9e moins ordonn\u00e9s [18]. Une explication m\u00e9canistique bas\u00e9e sur les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s physico-chimiques de ces deux solvants a \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9e pour expliquer les diff\u00e9rences observ\u00e9es dans la morphologie finale de L12 et L12D. Par rapport au DMSO, qui est aprotique, l'eau est un solvant a plus haute constante di\u00e9lectrique (s20 \u00b0C = 46,68 and 80,10, respectivement), mais avec un moment dipolaire plus faible (p,25 \u00b0C = 4,1 D and\n20 \u00b0C = 1,87 D, respectivement). De plus, les deux solvants ont des indices de polarit\u00e9 importants (7,2 et 10,2, respectivement). La constante di\u00e9lectrique du m\u00e9lange eau/DMSO utilis\u00e9 dans cette \u00e9tude (ratio molaire 527/328) a \u00e9t\u00e9 estim\u00e9e a 68 \u00b1 6 [25] Nous pensons que la cause de cette diff\u00e9rence de morphologie entre L12 et L12D est a trouver a un stade avanc\u00e9 du m\u00e9canisme r\u00e9actionnel. Dans la premiere \u00e9tape de la\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9 en fran^ais\t257\nprocedure, I'hydrolyse acide de P12 conduit a la formation d'un compose amphiphilique bis(silanetriol). Des interactions intermoleculaires fortes entre molecules voisines, telles que les liaisons hydrogene entre les groupes uree ou entre les fonctions silanol [26], mais aussi les interactions de van der Waals entre les chafnes alkyle promeuvent la formation du reseau siloxane, menant finalement a la formation et a l'organisation de rubans lamellaires fins. L'influence de la nature du solvant dans la structuration des materiaux derives de P12 a l'echelle micrometrique devrait s'operer a cette etape. Une explication plausible pour la difference de morphologie est la suivante: dans l'eau, les interactions hydrophobes entre les chafnes alkyle promeuvent un empilement face contre face des rubans lamellaires, menant finalement a la formation de plaquettes 3D (L12). Un tel empilement est favorise par la forte mobilite des charges et les faibles repulsions entre rubans charges qui ont lieu dans l'eau. A l'oppose, le DMSO interagit avec les chafnes alkyle lipophiles en stabilisant les rubans qui grandissent. De plus, la faible mobilite des charges dans le melange DMSO/eau et la plus faible constante dielectrique defavorisent les empilements face contre face, en privilegiant les approches face contre cote entre les rubans charges, ce qui conduit au final a des micro-objets ressemblant a des eponges (L12D). Le repliement des films, qui est rendu possible par leur faible epaisseur, contribue a la morphologie finale observee.\n2.2.\tAuto-structuration de silsesquioxanes pont\u00e9s lamellaires\ncomportant des espaceurs lat\u00e9raux longs\nDans cette section, nous avons \u00e9tudi\u00e9 \u00a1'influence des espaceurs lat\u00e9raux sur la structuration, la morphologie, et finalement les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s optiques des mat\u00e9riaux d\u00e9riv\u00e9s de P12. Nous avons pour cela \u00e9tudi\u00e9 une s\u00e9rie de mat\u00e9riaux hybrides \u00e0 base de chafnes alkyl\u00e8ne (appel\u00e9s Ci0CnCi0) d\u00e9riv\u00e9s de pr\u00e9curseurs de silsesquioxanes similaires au P12, mais incluant des espaceurs lat\u00e9raux compos\u00e9s de chafnes d\u00e9cyl\u00e8ne au lieu de\npropyl\u00e8ne ((EtO)3Si-(CH2)io-Y-(CH2)n-Y-(CH2)io-Si(OEt)3 avec n = 7, 9-12 (P10-n-10)). La structure des mat\u00e9riaux finaux a \u00e9t\u00e9 inspect\u00e9e par RMN 29Si MAS et 13C CP/MAS. Dans\nle spectre RMN\n29Si MAS, les mat\u00e9riaux donnent trois signaux larges \u00e0 -47, -58 et -68\nppm, attribu\u00e9s aux environnements T1, T2 et T3 du silicium, respectivement. Les degr\u00e9s de condensation calcul\u00e9s sont du meme ordre que ceux rapport\u00e9s pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment pur le mat\u00e9riau L12 [20, 27, 28] et plus r\u00e9cemment pour le mat\u00e9riau L12D a morphologie d'\u00e9ponge (cf Section 2.1) [29]. Ces r\u00e9sultats suggerent que dans C1oCnC1o les ponts siloxane sont inclus dans un r\u00e9seau 2D compos\u00e9 de polymeres lin\u00e9aires de siloxane. En RMN 13C CP/MAS, il est possible de distinguer les signaux attendus (cf Table 2.2.1, section 2.2), ce qui confirme la structure des mat\u00e9riaux finaux.\nLes images MEB donnent la preuve que la morphologie de C10CnC10 , qui varie entre de micro-objets irr\u00e9guliers a des microparticules sph\u00e9roidales denses, differe clairement de la morphologie de plaquettes des mat\u00e9raiux L8-L12, mais ressemble a celle de L12D. L'analyse des clich\u00e9s de MEB r\u00e9vele que la morphologie de C10C7C10 est plutot irr\u00e9guliere, alors que celle des \u00e9chantillons C10C9C10 et C10C10C10 ressemble beaucoup a celle de L12D. Ces deux mat\u00e9riaux forment des micro-objets avec une morphologie d'\u00e9ponge, et consistent en de tres fins rubans assembl\u00e9s cot\u00e9 contre face (n=9), ou en des rubans recourb\u00e9s et enchevetr\u00e9s (n=10). Pour C10C11C10, les rubans semblent consid\u00e9rablement plus repli\u00e9s, et forment des objets moins r\u00e9guliers. Le processus finit avec C10C12C10 et la production de particules sph\u00e9roidales homogenes denses de 10 pm de diametre qui tendent a se lier les unes aux autres. La contribution croissante du processus de repliement auquel les films sont sujets lorsque la longueur de l'espaceur central augmente est clairement reconnaissable dans les images de MET. L'organisation intrinseque dans les films/rubans est parfaitement \u00e9vidente dans le cas des \u00e9chantillons avec n = 9, n = 10, et n = 12. Des preuves additionnelles de la texture organis\u00e9e de C10C12C10 et en particulier de C10C10C10 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenues par AFM en scannant la surface des \u00e9chantillons en mode tapping. Le mode d'organisation observ\u00e9 dans les deux derniers mat\u00e9riaux est cependant moins bien reconnaissable dans le cas du mat\u00e9riau avec n = 9. La nature anisotropique de C10C10C10 est d\u00e9montr\u00e9e dans l'image de POM enregistr\u00e9e entre polariseurs crois\u00e9s. La bir\u00e9fringence observ\u00e9e indique une anisotropie sous-microm\u00e9trique. Les diffractogrammes de rayons X des diff\u00e9rents \u00e9chantillons montrent des profils completement diff\u00e9rents dans la r\u00e9gion des grands angles (q > 10 nm-1). Alors que le mat\u00e9riau C10C7C10 produit un pic large, mal d\u00e9fini centr\u00e9 a environ 15 nm-1, le maximum d'intensit\u00e9 de la bande est d\u00e9cal\u00e9 vers 15,7 nm-1 pour n = 9 et 11, et un \u00e9paulement est visible du cot\u00e9 des plus petits\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9 en franj\u00e1is\t259\nangles, en particulier dans le cas de ce dernier. Dans le cas du silsesquioxane pont\u00e9 avec l'espaceur central le plus long (C10C12C10), le profil de la bande devient mieux r\u00e9solu, et deux pics centr\u00e9s a 14,7 et 16,2 nm 1 sont discern\u00e9s. La mod\u00e9lisation des courbes, r\u00e9alis\u00e9e entre 12 et 19 nm-1 par des Gaussiennes nous a permis d'identifier quatre composants dans le profil des diffractogrammes des \u00e9chantillons avec n = 7, 9, 11 et 12, attribuables a la s\u00e9paration entre deux fragments ur\u00e9e adjacents du r\u00e9seau ur\u00e9e-ur\u00e9e form\u00e9 par l'interm\u00e9diaire de liaisons hydrogene (U), a l'ordre entre au sein du domaine siloxane (S) et aux espacements chafne-chafne (c-c). Les valeurs correspondantes sont rapport\u00e9es dans la Table A.1.\nTable A.2.1. Donnees de PXRD pour la region des grands angles des echanillons C10CnC10. Region des grands angles (q > 10 nm-1)\nq (nm-1)\td (nm) Attribution\n13.54\t0.464\tU\n14.65\t0.429\tS\n15.85\t0.392\tc-c\n17.15\t0.366\tc-c\nL'analyse de la region des petits angles des diffractogrammes XRD et SAXS permet de trouver des indications precieuses sur la conformation des chafnes alkyle. En comparant les distances interlamellaires l derivees des donnees de SAXS pour les materiaux C10CnC10 (avec n = 9, 10, et 12) avec les longueurs calculees pour les chafnes alkylene des espaceurs centraux et lateraux adoptant des conformations totalement etirees all-trans (en zig-zag), nous pouvons conclure que les conformeres all-trans et gauche coexistent dans les echantillons. Nous pouvons de plus conclure qu'il n'y a pas de relation lineaire entre l'augmentation de la longueur de chafne de l'espaceur central de C10C9C10, C10C10C10 et C10C12C10 et la deviation des valeurs longueur experimentales de la longueur l de celles calculees pour des chafnes alkylene parfaitement etirees alltrans. Ainsi, il apparait clairement qu'avec l'introduction de groupes methylene\nsuppl\u00e9mentaires dans l'espaceur central, la proportion de conformeres gauche\naugmente et que les chames alkylene deviennent moins bien empil\u00e9es. C'est un processus qui mene au final vers la compression des domaines silyl\u00e9s. Sur la base de ces donn\u00e9es, il est raisonnable de penser que les chames alkylene des mat\u00e9riaux CioCnCio avec n= 9, 10, et 12 sont tres probablement orient\u00e9s de fa^on non-perpendiculaire par rapport aux plans des r\u00e9seaux siloxane. Les donn\u00e9es de RMN CP/MAS du 13C corroborent les conclusions des exp\u00e9riences de SAXS.\nAfin d'avoir une meilleure appr\u00e9hension du degr\u00e9 d'empilement r\u00e9gulier des chames et du rapport conformationnel trans/gauche dans les mat\u00e9riaux hybrides C10CnC10, nous avons enregistr\u00e9 les spectres FT-IR et FT-Raman et examin\u00e9 les modes diagnostiques des chames alkylene: (1) les modes d'\u00e9longation CH2 sym\u00e9trique et antisym\u00e9trique (vsCH2 and vaCH2, respectivement). (2) Le mode de torsion CH2 (5CH2). L'analyse de la localisation et l'intensit\u00e9 du mode vsCH2 est rendue compliqu\u00e9e a cause de la r\u00e9sonnance de Fermi entre le mode fondamental de vsCH2 avec les nombreux\nharmoniques des vibrations 5CH2 [27, 30-33]. Le mode vaCH2 est affecte par le couplage avec les mouvements de rotation et de torsion des chames [27-30]. Dans le spectre Raman des chames alkyle ordonnees (conformation all-trans), le mode vaCH2 emerge comme une bande intense dans l'intervalle 2884-2878 cm-1, alors que le mode vsCH2 produit une bande a 2930 cm-1 (faible), 2900-2898 cm-1 (moyen) et 2850-2844 cm-1 (fort) [27-30]. Dans le cas des chames alkylene (en conformation gauche), le mode vaCH2 apparaft a 2897-2890 cm-1, et les bandes vsCH2 sont typiquement observees a 2920 cm-1 (moyen), 2904 cm-1 (moyen) et 2858-2853 cm-1 (fort) [27-30]. Un decalage vers les hauts nombres d'ondes, et un elargissement des bandes indiquent une proportion croissante des conformeres gauche. Les spectres FT-Raman dans la region des vCH2 des materiaux CioCnCio avec n pair ou impair sont domines par deux bandes a 2885 cm-1 (tres fort, vS)/ 2837 cm-1 (fort, S) et 2884 cm-1 (vS)/2858 cm-1 (S), respectivement. Dans les deux cas, un evenement intense, qui se manifeste comme un epaulement et est localise a 2850 et 2848 cm-1, respectivement, est discerne. Les pics a environ 2885 et 2859 cm-1 sont attribuables aux modes vaCH2 and vsCH2 des conformeres all-trans des chames alkylene [34,35]. La composante a ca 2858 cm-1, aussi associee avec le mode vsCH2 est caracteristique des conformeres gauche [35]. Le\nrapport des hauteurs de pics (r) entre les bandes vaCH2 and vsCH2 est un outil de choix\npour d\u00e9terminer le d\u00e9sordre conformationnel des chames alkylene et leur arrangement par empilement [31]. Des hautes valeurs de r (1.61-1.72) sont produites par des chames alkylene cristallines, tandis que les chames a l'\u00e9tat amorphe conduisent a des valeurs qui vont de 1.39 a 1.48 [31]. La repr\u00e9sentation du rapport des intensit\u00e9s r en fonction du nombre d'atomes de carbone des chames alkylene de l'espaceur central des mat\u00e9riaux CioCnCio suggere que les chames alkylene de l'\u00e9chantillon C10C7C10 (i.e. les chames des espaceurs lat\u00e9raux et celles des espaceurs centraux) sont completement d\u00e9sordonn\u00e9es et par cons\u00e9quent adoptent des conformations gauche. Dans les mat\u00e9riaux hybrides avec un espaceur central plus long (n > 7) la proportion des chames alkylene dens\u00e9ment empil\u00e9es et totalement \u00e9tir\u00e9es (conformeres all-trans) est augment\u00e9e consid\u00e9rablement. Pour C10C9C10 la valeur atteinte pour r coincide pratiquement avec la valeur minimum rapport\u00e9e pour les alcanes lin\u00e9aires solides, ce qui suggere que la pr\u00e9sence des chames d\u00e9cylene lat\u00e9rales et d'une chame centrale nonylene promeut un haut degr\u00e9 d'ordre et un empilement serr\u00e9. De plus, ces donn\u00e9es pointent aussi le fait que les mat\u00e9riaux avec n = 10, 11 et 12 contiennent plus de conformeres gauche que C10C9C10. L'inspection de la r\u00e9gion des 5CH2 est aussi tres int\u00e9ressante, puisque la fr\u00e9quence, l'intensit\u00e9, et la forme de la\nbande du mode 5CH2 sont sensibles aux interactions interchames et au mode d'empilement des chames [35, 36]. Les plus hautes fr\u00e9quences (~1472 cm-1) dans le spectre IR indiquent un ordonnement des chames alkylene en conformation all-trans (\u00e9tat cristallin), tandis qu'a des fr\u00e9quences plus basses (~1466 cm-1), un \u00e9largissement des bandes et une intensit\u00e9 plus faible indiquent une augmentation de la mobilit\u00e9 des chames, (\u00e9tat proche du liquide) et donc un rapport gauche/trans plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 [35].\nLes bandes centr\u00e9es a environ 1479 et 1466 cm-1 dans la r\u00e9gion des 5CH2 du spectre FT-IR des hybrides C10CnC10 r\u00e9velent l'occurrence de chames alkylene ordonn\u00e9es mais aussi d\u00e9sordonn\u00e9es, et donc la coexistence de conformeres all-trans et gauche [35, 37 ]. La bande situ\u00e9e a environ 1440 cm-1 discern\u00e9e dans le meme spectre repr\u00e9sente une preuve suppl\u00e9mentaire de l'existence d'arrangements gauche,\n[38,39]. Le mode 5CH2 est sensible a la parit\u00e9 du nombre d'atomes de carbone de\nl'espaceur central. Alors que les mat\u00e9riaux C10CnC10 avec un nombre n impair montrent un \u00e9paulement a environ 1460 cm-1, cette contribution est absente dans le cas des\nLes spectres d'\u00e9mission des \u00e9chantillons s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s C10CnC10 sont pratiquement ind\u00e9pendants de la longueur de l'espaceur alkylene central, et similaires a ceux rapport\u00e9s pour les mat\u00e9riaux hybrides contenant des espaceurs lat\u00e9raux propylene comme le silsesquioxane pont\u00e9 non structur\u00e9 A12 [19], les di-ur\u00e9asils [41, 42], les di-ur\u00e9thanesils [43], les di-amidosils, et les mono-amidosils structur\u00e9s en bicouches lamellaires[45]. L'\u00e9mission est attribu\u00e9e au recouvrement de deux composantes distinctes qui ont proviennent des r\u00e9seaux ur\u00e9e, ur\u00e9thane ou amide dans le cas des di-ur\u00e9asils, di-ur\u00e9thanesils et amidosils, respectivement, et des nanodomaines silyl\u00e9s. Les donn\u00e9es de spectroscopie en temps r\u00e9solu nous ont permis de d\u00e9montrer pour la premiere fois que les caract\u00e9ristiques d'\u00e9mission de la composante li\u00e9e aux groupes ur\u00e9e de l'\u00e9mission des silsesquioxanes structur\u00e9s par liaisons hydrogene entre les fragments ur\u00e9e d\u00e9pend de fa^on critique de la longueur des espaceurs alkylene lat\u00e9raux. Cela nous a permis de d\u00e9duire que la distance moyenne entre les r\u00e9gions silyl\u00e9es et les liens ur\u00e9es est pratiquement la meme dans les silsesquioxanes a chame lat\u00e9rale propyle ou d\u00e9cyle, ce qui suggere que les chames lat\u00e9rales longues adoptent pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentiellement des conformations gauche. Les spectres d'excitation des mat\u00e9riaux C10CnC10 ressemblent a ceux de A12 [19]. Cependant, alors que le temps de vie des composantes li\u00e9es au r\u00e9seau siloxane ressemble a ceux mesur\u00e9s pour les di-ur\u00e9asils, le temps de vie de la composante li\u00e9e aux ur\u00e9es est bien plus court, ce qui t\u00e9moigne du role crucial jou\u00e9 par les espaceurs longs dans la dynamique des deux \u00e9missions.\nLe rendement quantique absolu d'\u00e9mission de C10C11C10 est consid\u00e9rablement plus faible que la valeur la plus haute rapport\u00e9e pour les mat\u00e9riaux d\u00e9riv\u00e9s de P12 (A12), mais, a la diff\u00e9rence de ce dernier, est constant dans le temps.\n2.3.\tSynthese de mat\u00e9riaux hybrides mono-alkyl-ur\u00e9thanesils a structuration hi\u00e9rarchique\nDans cette partie, nous souhaitons \u00e9tudier une nouvelle famille de compos\u00e9s\nhybrides a structuration hi\u00e9rarchique appel\u00e9s mono-alkyl ur\u00e9thanesil. Cette famille de\ncompos\u00e9s a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9e par r\u00e9action d'une s\u00e9rie d'alcools (CYOH, avec Y=14, 16 et 22) avec le (3-isocyanatopropyl)tri\u00e9thoxysilane, ce qui permet la formation de liens ur\u00e9thane. Les effets de la nature du lien et de la longueur de la chame alkyle ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9s. Pour plus de simplicit\u00e9, les mat\u00e9riaux seront appel\u00e9s m-Ut(CY)-ac (Y = 14, 16 et 22). Nous souhaitons aussi \u00e9valuer l'effet de l'incorporation d'un co-solvant (DMSO) sur la morphologie finale, d'ou la synth\u00e8se d'un autre lot de mat\u00e9riaux pr\u00e9par\u00e9s pour une longueur de chame donn\u00e9e (Y = 16), en employant le DMSO comme co-solvant sous diff\u00e9rentes conditions. Ces \u00e9chantillons seront appel\u00e9s m-Ut(C16)-@ax (avec @ax = @ax, @ax and @ax qui repr\u00e9sentent les diff\u00e9rentes conditions exp\u00e9rimentales employ\u00e9es pour la pr\u00e9paration des \u00e9chantillons) (Cf section 2.3 pour les d\u00e9tails exp\u00e9rimentaux).\nLes spectres RMN 29Si CP MAS ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tudi\u00e9s: tous les \u00e9chantillons produisent des pics centr\u00e9s \u00e0 -47 (T1), -57 (T2) et -67 (T3) ppm, sans qu'il ne reste de pic \u00e0 -46 ppm caract\u00e9ristique des environnements T0. L'absence d'atome de silicium de type Q d\u00e9montre la pr\u00e9servation totale des liaisons Si-C. Les signaux T1 sont plus intenses dans le mat\u00e9riau @a2. L'\u00e9chantillon @a3 est domin\u00e9 par les environnements T3. Les degr\u00e9s de condensation sont plus hauts que ceux rapport\u00e9s pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment pour L12 (64-67%) [18], mais sont similaires \u00e0 ceux rapport\u00e9s pour L12D [29], pour les mat\u00e9riaux Ci0CnCi0 [46] (Section 2.2) et pour les mono-ur\u00e9thanesils (74%) [47]. En analysant les spectres RMN 13 C CP MAS, il apparaft que les groupes ur\u00e9thane, les liaisons Si-C et C-O ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9serv\u00e9s au cours de la synth\u00e8se. En effet, la preservation des liens ur\u00e9thane dans les mat\u00e9riaux finaux est prouv\u00e9e par le signal \u00e0 160 ppm, alors que les signaux associ\u00e9s avec les chames propyl\u00e8ne sont centr\u00e9s aux environs de 44, 24 et 10 ppm. Le signal observ\u00e9 \u00e0 64 ppm est attribu\u00e9 au groupe m\u00e9thyl\u00e8ne CH2-O, ce qui correspond \u00e0 la valeur de 65 ppm trouv\u00e9e dans le spectre en solution (CDCl3) du pr\u00e9curseur. Le signal \u00e0 14 ppm est attribu\u00e9 au CH3 terminal de la chame alkyle. Pour les \u00e9chantillons avec Y = 14, 16 et 22, la r\u00e9sonnance centr\u00e9e \u00e0 33.0 ppm est typique de structures ordonn\u00e9es. Cette tendance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est aussi observ\u00e9e pour les \u00e9chantillons @a3 et @a2 pour lesquels le signal principal est centr\u00e9 \u00e0 33 ppm. Pour les \u00e9chantillons y = 14 et @a3, un \u00e9paulement \u00e0 30 ppm indique la pr\u00e9sence de conformations gauche. L'\u00e9chantillon @a3 pr\u00e9sente un profil compl\u00e8tement diff\u00e9rent, et mieux r\u00e9solu. Des indications suppl\u00e9mentaires sur les conformations des chames peuvent \u00eatre obtenues par\nspectroscopie FT-IR dans les r\u00e9gions correspondant a l'\u00e9longation et a la torsion des groupes CH2. Comme dans les parties pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes (2.1 et 2.2), la spectroscopie FT-IR a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9e pour analyser les r\u00e9gions amide I et amide II [43, 48]. Ici, ces r\u00e9gions correspondent aux groupes ur\u00e9thane. Le profil global des spectres dans cette r\u00e9gion est similaire pour tous les \u00e9chantillons (avec une l\u00e9gere diff\u00e9rence pour @a3 ou un \u00e9paulement important est visible a 1650 cm-1). Les diffractogrammes de rayons X sur poudre ont \u00e9t\u00e9 analys\u00e9s dans la r\u00e9gion des grands angles (> 10 nm) et des petits angles (&lt;10 nm). Aux grands angles, des informations sur les distances ur\u00e9thane-ur\u00e9thane (U), les r\u00e9p\u00e9titions ordonn\u00e9es dans les r\u00e9seaux siloxane (S), et les distances chafne-chafne (c-c) peuvent etre obtenues. Il est a noter que l'\u00e9chantillon @a3 pr\u00e9sente une structure hautement cristalline.\nLe comportement thermique des mat\u00e9riaux m-Ut(CY)-ac a \u00e9t\u00e9 analys\u00e9 par les techniques TGA et DSC. Les courbes d'analyse thermogravim\u00e9trique des \u00e9chantillons m-Ut(CY)-ac avec Y = 14, 16 et 22 d\u00e9montrent que les mat\u00e9riaux sont stables thermiquement jusqu'a 250 \u00b0C; il est possible de distinguer des pics endothermiques dans les courbes de DSC avec des temp\u00e9ratures de transition diff\u00e9rentes de celles des pr\u00e9curseurs. Ces transitions nous ont conduits a r\u00e9aliser des analyses FT-IR a temp\u00e9rature variable. Les spectres FT-IR de l'\u00e9chantillon m-Ut(C16)-ac ont \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9s en fonction de la temp\u00e9rature, avec des cycles de r\u00e9chauffement-refroidissement afin de d\u00e9tecter un \u00e9ventuel comportement hyst\u00e9r\u00e9tique. A temp\u00e9rature ambiante, la bande vaCH2 est situ\u00e9e a 2916 cm-1, fr\u00e9quence caract\u00e9ristique des vaCH2 des alcanes lin\u00e9aires. Dans la phase de mont\u00e9e en temp\u00e9rature, au dessus de la temp\u00e9rature critique (onset) de transition de m-Ut(C16)-ac (68 \u00b0C), la band est d\u00e9cal\u00e9e vers de plus hauts nombres d'onde. Dans la phase de refroidissement, la fr\u00e9quence de vaCH2 retrouve sa valeur initiale, ce qui d\u00e9montre clairement que m-Ut(C16)-ac pr\u00e9sente un comportement hyst\u00e9r\u00e9tique r\u00e9versible quand l'\u00e9chantillon revient a temp\u00e9rature ambiante.\nLes variations dans les conditions exp\u00e9rimentales ont un impact sur les morphologies a l'\u00e9chelle du nanometre. A l'\u00e9chelle microm\u00e9trique, tous les mat\u00e9riaux sont bir\u00e9fringents lorsqu'on les observe en POM entre polariseur et analyseur crois\u00e9s. Les images de MEB montrent que pour Y = 14, des \"feuilles\" avec des dimensions de 20-30 pm sont obtenues. Tous les \u00e9chantillons sont lamellaires, mais lorsque l'on ]\t265\ncompare Y = 14 avec Y = 16, le premier pr\u00e9sente une morphologie sans caract\u00e9ristique particuliere, alors qu'une amplification forte du second permet de distinguer des paquettes fines qui semblent cristallines, avec une \u00e9paisseur de l'ordre du nanometre et des dimensions lat\u00e9rales de l'ordre du micrometre. Leur assemblage r\u00e9sulte en une morphologie de \"chou rouge\". L'empilement de plaquettes fines est aussi visible dans l'image AFM obtenue en mode tapping. Le balayage d'une section de l'\u00e9chantillon Y = 22 r\u00e9vele deux orientations perpendiculaires pour les plaquettes, ce qui pourrait expliquer les donn\u00e9es recueillies en XRD et DSC. Cette morphologie est de type \"rose des sables\". Les mat\u00e9riaux m-Ut(C16)@an r\u00e9velent l'influence des conditions exp\u00e9rimentales sur la morphologie. Tous ces \u00e9chantillons sont compos\u00e9s de plaquettes fines microm\u00e9triques, mais par exemple, l'\u00e9chantillon pr\u00e9par\u00e9 en l'absence de catalyseur HCl (@a2) est organis\u00e9 de fa^on al\u00e9atoire. Pour @a1, il est possible d'observer des morphologies distinctes selon l'amplification employ\u00e9e. Pour les plus faibles grossissements, la morphologie de \"rose des sables\" est discernable, comme nous l'avions d\u00e9crite pour m-Ut(C22)ac. A plus fort grossissement, les microplaques sont parfaitement ordonn\u00e9es, de fa^on parallele.\nEn photoluminescence, les spectres d'\u00e9mission et d'excitation, mais aussi les rendements quantiques d'\u00e9mission ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tudi\u00e9s. Les valeurs de rendement quantique sont inf\u00e9rieures a 0.11 pour tous les \u00e9chantillons \u00e9tudi\u00e9s, et sont peu affect\u00e9s par les variations \u00e9tudi\u00e9es (longueur de chame, conditions exp\u00e9rimentales).\nChapitre 3: Syst\u00e8mes biohybrides organiques-inorganiques \u00e0 application potentielle comme dispositifs \u00e9lectrochromes\nLe chapitre 3 est d\u00e9di\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude de prototypes de dispositifs \u00e9lectrochromes. Un\ndispositif \u00e9lectrochrome conventionnel comporte trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments principaux arrang\u00e9s en une structure en couche de type sandwich compos\u00e9e d'une \u00e9lectrode\n\u00e9lectrochrome et d'une contre \u00e9lectrode s\u00e9par\u00e9s par un \u00e9lectrolyte solide (par exemple un polym\u00e8re conducteur contenant des ions Li+, K+ or H+) (sch\u00e9ma A.1).\nSch\u00e9ma A.1. Exemple repr\u00e9sentatif de\ndispositif \u00e9lectrochrome utilis\u00e9: verre/IZO/WO3/d-\nPCL(530)/siloxane6.1Li12Eu12/IZO/verre (polarit\u00e9 associ\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat color\u00e9).\nAu cours des annees precedentes, le procede sol-gel est devenu une voie de synthese populaire pour la fabrication de dispositifs electrochromes [49-53]. La methode sol-gel offre de nombreux avantages par rapport aux techniques traditionnelles utilisees dans le contexte des technologies de revetement: (1) un degre eleve d'homogeneite des films est atteint, car les precurseurs sont melanges au niveau moleculaire; (2) les precurseurs sont relativement peu onereux, et une grande variete d'entre eux est disponible dans le commerce; (3) les equipements de depot sont relativement peu chers, et des grandes surfaces de revetement peuvent etre deposees grace a quelques techniques comme les dip-coating et spray coatings.\nUne commutation persistante et reversible de couleur a lieu en chargeant/dechargeant la cellule electrochimique lors de l'application d'une difference de potentiel. Les etats colores et transparents des dispositifs electrochromes sont habituellement appeles \"ecrits\" (written) et \"decolores\" (bleached), respectivement. Les materiaux electrochromes peuvent operer soit en mode de reflexion (pour l'affichage), ou de transmission (pour les fenetres \"intelligentes\"). Une caracteristique importante des dispositifs electrochromes lorsqu'ils sont colores est que la couleur peut etre preservee lorsque le courant est eteint. Cet effet memoire en fait des dispositifs efficaces en energie.\nEn vue d'une utilisation potentielle comme electrolytes pour des dispositifs\n\u00e9lectrochromes, nous montrerons dans ce chapitre la preparation et la caract\u00e9risation\nde deux nouvelles s\u00e9ries de biohybrides dop\u00e9s soit au triflate de lithium (Chapitre 3.1),\nsoit avec un m\u00e9lange de triflate de lithium et de triflate d'europium 1:1 (Chapitre 3.2). Ces biohybrides sont compos\u00e9s de silsesquioxanes pont\u00e9s comportant comme fragment organique pontant un segment poly(s-caprolactone) (PCL 530 Mn = 530 g mol-1) li\u00e9 au r\u00e9seau siloxane par des liens ur\u00e9thane. Cette \u00e9tude vient en continuation d'explorations pr\u00e9liminaires bas\u00e9es sur les syst\u00e8mes PCL(530)/siloxane dop\u00e9s au triflate de lithium ou au triflate de magn\u00e9sium.\nLa haute conductivit\u00e9 ionique montr\u00e9e par les poly\u00e9lectrolytes classiques \u00e0 base de poly(oxy\u00e9thylene) (POE) incorporant des ions K+ ont motiv\u00e9 l'emploi du triflate de potassium pour doper les biohybrides d-PCL(530) (Section 3.1)[54-57]. Le choix des sels dans la section 3.2 a \u00e9t\u00e9 stimul\u00e9 par l'effet de m\u00e9lange cationique (mixed cationic effect) [58], qui implique classiquement l'utilisation de deux sels au lieu d'un seul (c'est une proc\u00e9dure attractive qui a habituellement pour cons\u00e9quence une augmentation de la conductivit\u00e9 ionique des poly\u00e9lectrolytes). Nous souhaitons de plus obtenir une luminescence importante pour produire des mat\u00e9riaux biohybrides multifonctionnels \u00e9co-compatibles avec simultan\u00e9ment des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de luminescence et de conductivit\u00e9 ionique. Nous avons alors d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'employer les triflates d'europium et de lithium (Section 3.2).\nLe poly(s-caprolactone) (PCL) est un polyester lin\u00e9aire qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi car c'est un biopolym\u00e8re extr\u00eamement attractif, bien que synth\u00e9tique. C'est un thermoplastique aliphatique, biocompatible, perm\u00e9able, hydrophobe, biod\u00e9gradable et non toxique pour les organismes vivants, qui peut \u00eatre r\u00e9sorb\u00e9 par l'organisme apr\u00e8s un certain temps post\u00e9rieur \u00e0 l'implantation. Les PCL et leurs copolym\u00e8res ont des applications potentielles dans le domaine de la m\u00e9decine comme fils de suture biod\u00e9gradables, peau artificielle, proth\u00e8ses r\u00e9sorbables et comme conteneurs pour la lib\u00e9ration control\u00e9 de m\u00e9dicaments [59-61]. Les hybrides PCL/silice pourraient trouver des applications comme bio-verres d\u00e9gradables, comme mat\u00e9riaux de rev\u00eatement pour les implants d'os et autres dispositifs proth\u00e9tiques, comme supports pour l'immobilisation d'enzymes [62], et m\u00eame comme substituts d'os [63].\nLes structure, morphologie, stabilit\u00e9 thermique, conductivit\u00e9 ionique et stabilit\u00e9 \u00e9lectrochimique des deux s\u00e9ries de mat\u00e9riaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caract\u00e9ris\u00e9es. Des \u00e9tudes exploratoires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entreprises sur les performances des prototypes de dispositifs \u00e9lectrochromes dans lesquels les biohybrides organiques-inorganiques de composition 268\tR\u00e9sum\u00e9 en fran\u00e7ais\noptimis\u00e9e ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s comme couche active conductrice d'ions. Ces dispositifs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caract\u00e9ris\u00e9s selon diff\u00e9rents parametres: le contraste \u00e9lectrochrome, changement de densit\u00e9 optique, temps de commutation, et m\u00e9moire en circuit ouvert. L'efficacit\u00e9 de coloration pour le prototype explor\u00e9 dans la section 2.2 a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tudi\u00e9.\n3.1.\tElectrolytes biohybrides poly(s-caprolactone)/siloxane dop\u00e9s K+ pour les dispositifs \u00e9lectrochromes\nBiohybride \u00e0 base de d-PCL(530)/siloxane dop\u00e9 au KCF3SO3\nAfin de pr\u00e9parer des biohybrides a base de d-PCL(530)/siloxane dop\u00e9s au KCF3SO3 nous avons appliqu\u00e9 une m\u00e9thode de synthese d\u00e9crite par ailleurs [63], qui est une modification de celle rapport\u00e9e pour l'analogue dop\u00e9 au triflate de lithium [64] [64]. Les mat\u00e9riaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenus sous la forme de monolithes transparents et flexibles Ces ormolytes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9s en utilisant la notation d-PCL(530)/siloxanenKCF3SO3. Des x\u00e9rogels avec n =\t200, 100, 40, 29, 21, 10, 4, 2, 1 et\n0 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits.\nLes diffractogrammes des \u00e9chantillons avec n = z, 100 and 40 r\u00e9v\u00e8lent que ces x\u00e9rogels sont compl\u00e8tement amorphes. L'\u00e9chantillon dilu\u00e9 avec n = 200 donne lieu \u00e0 un pic \u00e0 21,4\u00b0, qui est caract\u00e9ristique du PCL(530). La m\u00eame caract\u00e9ristique apparaft comme un pic mal d\u00e9fini dans le profil XRD des mat\u00e9riaux avec n = 21 et 10. Pour n = 29 et 21, une r\u00e9flexion de Bragg de nature inconnue \u00e9merge \u00e0 28.5\u00b0. L'\u00e9chantillon concentr\u00e9 avec n = 4 produit une s\u00e9rie de pics faibles qui ne correspondent pas \u00e0 ceux du sel pur ou du PCL(530). Nous les avons associ\u00e9 avec la formation d'un complexe d-PCL(530)/siloxane-KCF3SO3 cristallin de strechiom\u00e9trie inconnue. Dans les \u00e9chantillons les plus riches en sel, avec n = 2, 1 et 0.5, ce compos\u00e9 cristallin coexiste avec le sel pur. Les clich\u00e9s de MEB obtenus sont en parfait accord avec les donn\u00e9es de diffraction des rayons X; celles de DSC corroborent aussi ces conclusions. Les donn\u00e9es d'analyse thermogravim\u00e9trique nous ont permis de d\u00e9duire que la d\u00e9composition des x\u00e9rogels\navec 1 &lt;n &lt;z, est initi\u00e9e \u00e0 la m\u00eame temp\u00e9rature (environ 235 \u00b0C), ce qui est une\nindication que la stabilit\u00e9 thermique du r\u00e9seau PCL(530)/siloxane sous atmosph\u00e8re\nnon oxydante n'est pratiquement pas affect\u00e9e par la pr\u00e9sence de quantit\u00e9s croissantes de KCF3SO3. Les donn\u00e9es de conductivit\u00e9 r\u00e9velent que dans ce systeme \u00e9lectrolyte hybride les \u00e9chantillons de composition entre n = 4 et 21 ont les meilleures conductivit\u00e9s sur l'ensemble de la gamme de temp\u00e9rature analys\u00e9e. A 40 \u00b0C, les maxima de de conductivit\u00e9 coincident, alors qu'a plus haute temp\u00e9rature le mat\u00e9riau avec n = 21 donne des valeurs sensiblement plus hautes que les autres.\nAfin de clarifier la relation entre conductivit\u00e9 ionique et association ionique, nous avons d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'inspecter l'environnement chimique ressenti par les ions K+ et CF3SO3-dans le milieu d-PCL(530)/siloxane sur l'ensemble de l'intervalle de concentration consid\u00e9r\u00e9. La mod\u00e9lisation des bandes IR, r\u00e9alis\u00e9e sur l'intervalle 1800-1650 cm-1 nous a permis de r\u00e9soudre le profil de la courbe de l'hybride d-PCL(530)/siloxane en 4 composantes distinctes localis\u00e9es a environ 1762, 1736, 1720 et 1692 cm-1 [63, 65]. La bande a 1762 cm-1 est associ\u00e9e avec la pr\u00e9sence de groupes carbonyles \"libres\" (non associ\u00e9s par liaisons hydrogene) des liens ur\u00e9thane. La composante a 1736 cm-1 est caract\u00e9ristique des chafnes du PCL(530) amorphe. Celle a 1720 cm-1 est attribu\u00e9e a la pr\u00e9sence d'associations oxy\u00e9thylene/ur\u00e9thane par liaisons hydrogene, tandis que celle a 1692 cm-1 est assign\u00e9e a la formation d'agr\u00e9gats ur\u00e9thane/ur\u00e9thane et ur\u00e9thane/ester [63, 65]. L'\u00e9tude de l'environnement anionique a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9e en utilisant la spectroscopie FT-Raman. Nous avons examin\u00e9 la r\u00e9gion spectrale caract\u00e9ristique du mode de vibration par \u00e9longation des groupes SO3 [66, 67] Le mode vsSO3 des ions triflates libres donne une bande a 1032 cm-1. La r\u00e9gion des vsSO3 en FT-Raman a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9compos\u00e9e en plusieurs pics. La bande pro\u00e9minente pour les \u00e9chantillons les plus dilu\u00e9s est celle a 1032 cm-1. Cette caract\u00e9ristique, pr\u00e9sente sur l'ensemble de l'intervalle de concentration consid\u00e9r\u00e9, confirme la pr\u00e9sence d'anions libres, et possiblement des paires d'ions \u201ccross-link separated ion pairs\". Les composantes a 1038 et 1024 cm-1, aussi d\u00e9tect\u00e9es pour tous les \u00e9chantillons, sont associ\u00e9s avec des ions triflate faiblement coordin\u00e9s et localis\u00e9s dans deux types de sites: (1) des especes CF3SO3- faiblement li\u00e9es aux ions K+, qui interagissent simultan\u00e9ment avec l'atome d'oxygene des carbonyles des groupes ur\u00e9thane; (2) les ions CF3SO3- li\u00e9s par liaison hydrogene aux groupes N-H des ur\u00e9thanes. La composante a 1045 cm-1, que l'on trouve dans tous les spectres FT-Raman, est associ\u00e9e a l'existence de paires d'ions en contact.

Les thermogrammes d'ATG r\u00e9velent aussi que la d\u00e9composition a lieu respectivement en deux et trois \u00e9tapes. Dans le cas de l'\u00e9chantillon riche en sels d-PCL(530)/siloxane6.1Li12Eu12, apres une perte en masse initiale de 8% environ, le thermogramme montre deux chutes importantes a 220 \u00b0C et 400 \u00b0C. Dans l'\u00e9chantillon le plus concentr\u00e9 d-PCL(530)/siloxane3.2Li6Eu7, la d\u00e9composition thermique commence directement a partir de la temp\u00e9rature ambiante, et consiste en un processus multi-\u00e9tapes au dessous de 500 \u00b0C. Les \u00e9chantillons hybrides avec n > 6,1 sont semi-cristallins. Dans le cas des \u00e9chantillons dilu\u00e9s d-PCL(530)/siloxane52.6Li99Eu111 et d-PCL(530)/siloxane27.0Li50Eu56, un pic endothermique faible centr\u00e9 aux alentours de 47 \u00b0C est visible dans le thermogramme de DSC. La formation de r\u00e9gions de PCL(530)\nlibres cristallins dans les deux hybrides est en parfait accord avec la presence d'une paire de pics de Bragg fins et intense caracteristiques du PCL(530) a 23,8 et 21,6\u00b0 dans\nles profils de XRD. Dans les clich\u00e9s de MEB pris pour d-PCL(530)/siloxane52.6L\u00cd5oEu56 et\nd-PCL(530)/siloxane27.oLi50Eu56,\nla pr\u00e9sence de zones correspondant \u00e0 des chames\ncristallines de PCL(530) est visible. La formation d'une nouvelle phase cristalline dans le syst\u00e8me hybride d-PCL(530)/siloxanenLimEum' \u00e0 haute concentration en sel est clairement identifiable dans les clich\u00e9s de MEB.\nLa courbe de conductivit\u00e9 d'Arrh\u00e9nius du biohybride d-PCL(530)/siloxanenLimEum' montre une d\u00e9pendance en temp\u00e9rature des conductivit\u00e9s ioniques de certains des \u00e9chantillons PCL(530)/siloxanenLiCF3SO3 \u00e9tudi\u00e9s pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment. L'addition d'un m\u00e9lange de LiCF3SO3 and [Eu(CF3SO3)3(H2O)3].7H2O \u00e0 la matrice h\u00f4te d-PCL(530)/siloxane au lieu du simple triflate de lithium est une r\u00e9ussite, car une augmentation remarquable de la conductivit\u00e9 ionique en a r\u00e9sult\u00e9, ce qui est une manifestation claire de l'effet de m\u00e9lange de cations. Par exemple, alors qu'\u00e0 25 \u00b0C la conductivit\u00e9 de l'hybride d-PCL(530)/siloxane52.6Li99Euin est d'environ 2x10-8 S cm -1, il atteint 2.3x10-6 S cm-1 \u00e0 100 \u00b0C. Ces valeurs sont d'une magnitude plus haute d'un ordre de grandeur par rapport \u00e0 celles pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment mesur\u00e9es pour les matrices d-PCL(530)/siloxane dop\u00e9es seulement au triflate de lithium avec n = 93 (5.44x10-9 et 5.93x10-7 Scm-1 \u00e0 27 et -100 \u00b0C, respectivement). Dans l'intervalle des hautes temp\u00e9ratures, (\u00e0 environ 100\t\u00b0C), la conductivit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9chantillon d-\nPCL(530)/siloxane3.2Li6Eu7 coincide pratiquement avec celle de la composition la plus conductrice de la s\u00e9rie des d-PCL(530)siloxanenLiCF3SO3 (n = 0.5) (2.94x10-5 et 3.2x10-5 Scm-1, respectivement). Le maximum de conductivit\u00e9 pour le syst\u00e8me d-PCL(530)/siloxanenLimEum' est situ\u00e9 \u00e0 n = 6,1 sur l'intervalle entier de temp\u00e9ratures \u00e9tudi\u00e9 (3.7x10-7 et 1.71x10-4 Scm-1 \u00e0 20 et 102 \u00b0C, respectivement). Le voltamogramme cyclique \u00e0 micro\u00e9lectrode du mat\u00e9riau d-PCL(530)/siloxane27.0Li50Eu56 sur l'intevalle de potentiel -2,0 - 8.0 V obtenu \u00e0 30 \u00b0C d\u00e9montre que la r\u00e9gion anodique de l'\u00e9chantillon est stable jusqu'\u00e0 environ 5.0 V par rapport \u00e0 Li/Li+, tandis que dans la r\u00e9gion cathodique, la d\u00e9position de lithium n'est pas d\u00e9tect\u00e9e. Cela signifie que le syst\u00e8me d-PCL(530)/siloxane27.0Li50Eu56 est globalement stable sur plus de 7 V, ce qui indique que ce mat\u00e9riau montre une fen\u00eatre de stabilit\u00e9 acceptable pour des applications comme dispositif \u00e9lectrochimique \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat solide. Ces r\u00e9sultats sont en parfait accord avec ceux trouv\u00e9s pour les mat\u00e9riaux d-PCL(530)siloxane0.sLiCF3SO3.\nPour comprendre le r\u00f4le jou\u00e9 par les atomes d'oxyg\u00e9ne des groupements carbonyle des fonctions ur\u00e9thane dans la coordination des ions Li+ et Eu3+, nous avons examin\u00e9 la signature spectrale des hybrides d-PCL(530)/siloxanenLi mEum' dans la r\u00e9gion\namide I des spectres FT-IR [63, 65]. L'inclusion de L\u00cdCF3SO3 et [Eu(CF3SO3)3(H2O)3].7H2O dans la matrice d-PCL(530)/siloxane produit une s\u00e9rie de modifications marqu\u00e9es dans I'environnement des groupes C=O qui se manifestent dans la r\u00e9gion amide I par une redistribution des bandes. Globalement, l'incorporation de quantit\u00e9s croissantes de sels \"invit\u00e9s\" dans l'hote hybride conduit \u00e0 un renforcement des liaisons hydrog\u00e8ne, \u00e0 la saturation des groupes C=O libre des ur\u00e9thanes, et \u00e0 la formation de nouveaux et tr\u00e8s forts agr\u00e9gats par liaison hydrog\u00e8ne d'ur\u00e9thane coordin\u00e9s au cation. Pour \u00e9tudier les environnements chimiques des ions triflates \u00e0 des concentrations croissantes de sels m\u00e9lang\u00e9s, nous avons analys\u00e9 les spectres FT-IR des mat\u00e9riaux hybrides d-PCL(530)/siloxanenLi mEum' dans la r\u00e9gion des modes de vibrations d'\u00e9longation des\ngroupes SO3 (vsSO3). La bande vsSO3 a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solue en quatre composantes: une bande\npro\u00e9minente \u00e0 1032 cm-1, deux \u00e9paulements positionn\u00e9s \u00e0 environ 1038 et 1025\ncm\n-1\net un pic faible centr\u00e9 \u00e0 environ 1045 cm-1. La d\u00e9tection de la bande \u00e0 1031\ncm\n-1\nindique la presence d'anions libres dans les trois echantillons [66, 67].\nL'emission des materiaux d-PCL(530)/siloxane27Li5oEu56 a ete enregistree sous\ndiff\u00e9rentes longueurs d'onde d'excitation. Les spectres d'\u00e9mission sont compos\u00e9s\nd'une bande large, dont l'\u00e9nergie d\u00e9pend de la longueur d'onde d'excitation, superpos\u00e9e sur une s\u00e9rie de pics fins attribu\u00e9s aux transitions 5D0 >7F0 4 des ions Eu3+. Une bande large d'\u00e9mission similaire avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9e pour les mat\u00e9riaux hybrides non dop\u00e9s d-PCL(530)/siloxane [63], et avait \u00e9t\u00e9 attriu\u00e9e \u00e0 des\nrecombinaisons electron-trou a partir de defauts dans le reseau siloxane et dans le reseau de liens croises ente les groupes urethane. Les caracteristiques d'emission ont ensuite ete quantifiees par la mesure des courbes de declin des etats excites 5D0.\nCaract\u00e9risation des dispositifs \u00e9lectrochromes\nLa construction des prototypes de dispositifs \u00e9lectrochromes a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9e pour\nune concentration specifique: n = 6.1, m= 12, m'=12. La commutation optique du dispositif electrochrome verre/IZO/WO3/d-PCL(530)/siloxane6.iLii2Eui2/IZO/verre du jaune clair au bleu fonce uniformement sombre a lieu en chargeant/dechargeant la cellule electrochimique par l'application de potentiels de -4 V et + 4 V pendant 50 s. La\ntransmittance\nmoyenne (T) du dispositif bas\u00e9 sur le mat\u00e9riau\nd-\natteignant 44,9% pour l'\u00e9tat color\u00e9. La variation de densit\u00e9 optique A(OD) dans la r\u00e9gion du visible est done de 0,13. Cette valeur coincide avec celle calcul\u00e9e \u00e0 555 nm (Td\u00e9coloi-\u00e9 = 41 % and Tcolor\u00e9 = 58 %). Il faut rappeler que l'reil humain est sensible aux ondes lumineuses dont les longueurs d'onde sont comprises entre 400 et 700 nm (visible). Sous illumination forte (lumi\u00e8re du jour) la sensibilit\u00e9 maximale de l'reil est dans la r\u00e9gion spectrale correspondant au vert (555 nm, vision photopique). L'efficacit\u00e9 de coloration (CE = A(OD)/AQ) du dispositif verre/IZO/WO3/d-PCL(530)/siloxane61Li12Eu12/IZO/verre a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9e sur la base de mesures de chronoamp\u00e9rom\u00e9trie. Une efficacit\u00e9 de coloration haute correspond \u00e0 une grande modulation optique pour une petite charge d'insertion/d\u00e9sinsertion. Durant la phase de coloration de l'\u00e9tat jaune clair au bleu fonc\u00e9 uniforme, un courant de -4 V a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9 pendant 50 s : la charge, sous la forme d'\u00e9lectrons et d'ions Li+ a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9e des couches d'oxyde conducteur (IZO) et conducteur ionique, respectivement, \u00e0 la couche \u00e9lectrochrome. Sous ces conditions, le WO3 a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duit, et a subi simultan\u00e9ment une insertion d'ions Li+. En renversant la polarit\u00e9 du courant appliqu\u00e9, la d\u00e9coloration a r\u00e9sult\u00e9 (c'est-\u00e0-dire que le WO3 a \u00e9t\u00e9 oxyd\u00e9, et les ions Li+ ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9s) et le dispositif a retrouv\u00e9 son \u00e9tat initial, c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'il est pass\u00e9 du bleu fonc\u00e9 au jaune p\u00e2le. Au cours de cette \u00e9tude, le dispositif n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 cycl\u00e9 que pour une p\u00e9riode tr\u00e8s courte (1 500 s, soit 15 cycles).\nLa densit\u00e9 de charge d\u00e9croft graduellement au cours du cyclage, bien que cette tendance soit plus abrupte durant les 5 premiers cycles. On peut aussi d\u00e9duire de la Figure 3.2.12 que le rapport entre les charges cathodiques et anodiques (Qin/Qout) des dispositifs d\u00e9croft au cours du cyclage, ce qui d\u00e9montre une am\u00e9lioration progressive de la r\u00e9versibilit\u00e9 d'insertion/d\u00e9sinsertion. Pour le second cycle, une valeur haute d'efficacit\u00e9 de coloration de 577 cm2C-1 a \u00e9t\u00e9 estim\u00e9e pour un A(OD) de 0,15. La courte p\u00e9riode de temps couveerte par les mesures de chronoamp\u00e9rom\u00e9trie (seulement 15 cycles) ne nous permet pas de conclure sur la stabilit\u00e9 du dispositif \u00e9lectrochrome verre/IZO/WO3/d-PCL(530)/siloxane61Li12Eu12/IZO/verre. La m\u00e9moire \u00e9lectrochrome\nd'un tel dispositif est sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 garder son \u00e9t\u00e9t d'absorption lorsque le courant est\neteint. Notre prototype est assez bon dans ce domaine, avec une memoire en circuit ouvert d'environ un mois.\nR\u00e9f\u00e9rences\n1.\tD. Avnir, T. Coradin, O. Lev, J. Livage, J. Mater.
