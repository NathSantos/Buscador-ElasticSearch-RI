They turn empty heads into a paradise of ideas,\n\nknowledge and conscious opinions. They transform human beings into citizens. And,\n\nyet, they get almost nothing back (especially nowadays, especially in Brazil). They\n\nare not even respected by most of the students \u2014 or their parents, as a matter of fact.\n\nTeachers have nothing but this unmeasurable passion for giving all they have in their\n\nminds in the hope that a few of the listeners is going to grow to be a good person.\n\nToday, I hope I am one of them. That is why I begin here by thanking all my teachers,\n\nfrom my childhood to my adolescence. They made me understand that, in my own\n\nwords at that time, I wanted nothing but to be an eternal student.\n\nMy special thanks go to two teachers that made me want to be a scientist.\n\nFirst, my father Jo\u00e3o, my Physics teacher, in whom I mirror myself to be as much\n\norganized, determined and passionate about something as he is. I am very proud\n\nto be a lot like him in this sense. Dad, I want you to know that everything your dad\n\nexpected you to be, you became: a scientist, a master, a bright mind, and on the top of\n\nall that, an amazing parent. Second, my first Science teacher, Lucilia, who presented\n\nme to this amazing world and always encouraged me to pursue Ocean Sciences.\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments ix\n\nI also thank all my professors at the University, especially the ones who\n\nshowed me what kind of professor I want to be some years ahead from now. To\n\nmy advisors \u2014 Rodrigo, Mauricio, and Ilana \u2014, I give my sincere acknowledgements\n\nfor giving me the opportunity to learn from them in all kinds of situation. To McGill\n\nUniversity and my supervisor, Dr. Lawrence Mysak, my eternal appreciation for wel-\n\ncoming me at his research group for one year. Prof. Mysak showed me what is to\n\nbe an honest and respected scientist, an exceptional professor and advisor, and a\n\nremarkable human being.\n\nI am extremely grateful to my mother. Even with a broken heart from seeing\n\na child leave for so long and so far, she always supported me in my decisions and\n\ncomforted me when those were the wrong ones. My mom is always there, no matter\n\nwhat. She is brave and loving, as every mother in the world should be. I thank my\n\nsister for her love and her husband for our nerd talks. To my aunts, uncles, cousins,\n\nand grandparents (the four of them), I thank to be part of this family. I still believe, as\n\na kid does, that our family is perfect.\n\nTo my husband-to-be, I thank for his endless love, patience, support, and\n\nencouragement. I could not have done it without him. He never let me give up or\n\ndesperate when things got ugly. He is not only my sweetheart. He is my partner, he is\n\nmy team, he is my best friend. That is how I know we will be always together. To my\n\nparents-in-law, I also thank for their love and support at every single moment of the\n\nlast three years.\n\nI thank my friends, the scientist ones and the mentally-healthy ones too. Marc\n\nand Ana Paula, in particular, thank you for sharing academic crises, deep conversa-\n\ntions about life and science, and, of course, hilarious comics and cat videos.\n\nFinally, I thank the FAPESP agency for allowing me to continue my academic\n\nformation through the grants 2011/02047-9 and 2013/20977-9.\n\nEach piece of this work exists because of you all.\n\n\n\nx\n\n\"My goal is simple.

A\n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o de CO2 atmosf\u00e9rico aumentou cerca de 50% (Monnin et al.,\n\n2001) e a temperatura m\u00e9dia global aumentou 4,0\u00b10,8?C at\u00e9 a \u00e9poca\n\npr\u00e9-industrial (Annan and Hargreaves, 2013). Como consequ\u00eancia deste aqueci-\n\nmento, os grandes mantos de gelo que cobriam a Am\u00e9rica do Norte, o norte da\n\nEuropa e parte da Eur\u00e1sia derreteram e os oceanos polar e subpolar receberam\n\ngrandes quantidades de \u00e1gua doce destes mantos em retra\u00e7\u00e3o. A entrada de \u00e1gua\n\ndoce altera gradientes de press\u00e3o na superf\u00edcie do mar e tamb\u00e9m a densidade de\n\nmassas de \u00e1gua. Como a circula\u00e7\u00e3o oce\u00e2nica \u00e9 parcialmente for\u00e7ada por diferen\u00e7as\n\nde densidade, a \u00e1gua de degelo tem o potencial de afetar esta circula\u00e7\u00e3o. Nesta tese\n\nde Doutorado, os impactos da entrada de \u00e1gua de degelo no oceano desde o \u00daltimo\n\nM\u00e1ximo Glacial em altas latitudes, especialmente do Oceano Atl\u00e2ntico, s\u00e3o estuda-\n\ndos usando os resultados de uma simula\u00e7\u00e3o transiente dos \u00faltimos 22 mil anos com o\n\nmodelo NCAR-CCSM3. Os principais resultados mostram que: (1) a circula\u00e7\u00e3o de re-\n\nvolvimento meridional do Atl\u00e2ntico enfraqueceu durante eventos de descarga de \u00e1gua\n\ndoce pr\u00f3xima a regi\u00f5es de forma\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua densa; (2) a \u00c1gua Profunda do Atl\u00e2ntico\n\n\n\nResumo xii\n\nNorte (APAN) estava ausente no come\u00e7o da deglacia\u00e7\u00e3o, enquanto sua vers\u00e3o inter-\n\nmedi\u00e1ria \u2014 \u00c1gua Glacial Intermedi\u00e1ria do Atl\u00e2ntico Norte (AGIAN) \u2014 era formada;\n\n(3) AGIAN era uma massa d\u2019\u00e1gua doce e fria, semelhante \u00e0 \u00c1gua Intermedi\u00e1ria An-\n\nt\u00e1rtica (AIA) no dom\u00ednio termohalino atual; (4) as camadas profundas e de fundo da\n\nbacia do Atl\u00e2ntico eram dominadas pela \u00c1gua de Fundo Ant\u00e1rtica (AFA) na primeira\n\nmetade da simula\u00e7\u00e3o; (5) a transi\u00e7\u00e3o de AGIAN para APAN ocorreu ap\u00f3s o Heinrich\n\nStadial 1; (6) quando a APAN apareceu, cerca de 12 mil anos atr\u00e1s (ka), a AFA retraiu\n\ne ficou limitada \u00e0s camadas de fundo; (7) a presen\u00e7a de uma camada de baixa salini-\n\ndade na superf\u00edcie do Oceano Austral h\u00e1 ?14 mil anos impedia a libera\u00e7\u00e3o de calor\n\ndas \u00e1guas profundas para a atmosfera, aquecendo a AFA; (8) a Corrente Costeira\n\nAnt\u00e1rtica foi intensificada pela descarga de \u00e1gua de degelo proveniente do manto\n\nde gelo Ant\u00e1rtico. Usando o Oceano \u00cdndico como compara\u00e7\u00e3o, foi observado que\n\no Atl\u00e2ntico Norte afetou o \u00cdndico oeste tropical atrav\u00e9s de processos atmosf\u00e9ricos,\n\nenquanto varia\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas associadas ao Hemisf\u00e9rio Sul foram transmitidas via\n\noceano \u2014 especialmente atrav\u00e9s das camadas intermedi\u00e1rias. Embora as condi\u00e7\u00f5es\n\niniciais dos oceanos glacial e moderno sejam diferentes, este estudo pode ser usado\n\npara prever as poss\u00edveis respostas do oceano ao presente derretimento acelerado\n\nde geleiras e mantos de gelo associado a mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas abruptas.\n\n\n\nxiii\n\nAbstract\n\nD\nURING the last 21,000 years, the planet underwent major changes. The\n\natmospheric CO2 concentration increased ?50% (Monnin et al., 2001)\n\nand the mean global temperature increased 4.0\u00b10.8?C until pre-industrial\n\ntimes (Annan and Hargreaves, 2013). As a consequence of this warming, the huge\n\nice sheets that covered North America, Northern Europe and part of Eurasia melted\n\nand the polar and subpolar ocean surface received a large amount of freshwater from\n\nthese retracting ice sheets. The input of freshwater alters pressure gradients on the\n\nsea surface and also the density of water masses. Since the ocean circulation is par-\n\ntially driven by density differences, the deglacial meltwater has the potential to affect\n\nthe ocean circulation. In this PhD thesis, the impacts of meltwater input since the\n\nLast Glacial Maximum into the high latitudes, especially of the Atlantic Ocean, are\n\nstudied using the results of a transient simulation of the last 22 thousand years with\n\nNCAR-CCSM3. The main results show that: (1) the Atlantic Meridional Overturn-\n\ning Circulation (AMOC) slowed down during freshwater discharge events near dense\n\nwater formation regions; (2) North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) was absent in the\n\nbeginning of the deglaciation, while its intermediate version \u2014 Glacial North Atlantic\n\n\n\nAbstract xiv\n\nIntermediate Water (GNAIW) \u2014 was being formed; (3) GNAIW was a fresh and cold\n\nwater mass, very similar to the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) in the thermo-\n\nhaline domain; (4) the deep and abyssal Atlantic basin was dominated by AABW in\n\nthe first half of the simulation; (5) the transition from GNAIW to NADW occurred after\n\nthe Heinrich Stadial 1; (6) when the NADW appeared, around 12 thousand years ago\n\n(ka), AABW retracted and was constrained to lie near the bottom; (7) the presence of\n\na low-salinity layer in the Southern Ocean surface around 14,000 years ago prevented\n\nthe release of heat from deep waters to the atmosphere, warming the AABW; (8) the\n\nAntarctic Coastal Current (ACoC) was reinforced by the meltwater discharge from the\n\nAntarctic ice sheet. Using the Indian Ocean as a comparison, it was observed that the\n\nNorth Atlantic affected the western tropical Indian through atmosphere, while climatic\n\nvariations associated with the Southern Hemisphere were transmitted via ocean \u2014\n\nespecially through intermediate waters. Although the initial conditions in the glacial\n\nand modern ocean are different, this study may be used to foresee the possible re-\n\nsponses of the ocean to the accelerated melting of glaciers and ice sheets, which are\n\nassociated with dramatic climate changes.\n\n\n\n1\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nIntroduction\n\nT\nHE impact of human activities on the climate has never been so evident. Ac-\n\ncording to IPCC 5th Assessment Report (2013), more than a half of the\n\nobserved increase in the global mean surface temperature from 1951 to\n\n2010 was caused by anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentra-\n\ntions and other anthropogenic forcings together. The climate system is responding\n\nto this warming: over the last twenty years, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets\n\nhave been losing mass and glaciers have continued to shrink almost worldwide. Be-\n\ntween 1992 and 2011, the melting of ice sheets has contributed to a sea level rise\n\nrate of 0.59\u00b1 0.20 mm/yr (Shepherd et al., 2012). Moreover, the projections for fu-\n\nture climate point out that current glacier extents are out of balance with the present\n\nclimatic conditions, indicating that glaciers will continue to shrink even without further\n\ntemperature increase. Meanwhile, the oceans are receiving all this melted ice and\n\nthe scientific community is concerned about the changes in ocean circulation that this\n\nmeltwater input may trigger (e.g., Swingedouw et al., 2006; Driesschaert et al., 2007;\n\n\n\n2\n\nHu et al., 2011; Blaschek et al., 2014).\n\nThe oceans are fundamental to the climate system as they are the major sink\n\nof atmospheric energy and carbon (e.g., Ellis et al., 1978; Hall and Bryden, 1982;\n\nGruber et al., 2002; Sabine et al., 2004). The large-scale ocean circulation distributes\n\nheat from the tropical regions to higher latitudes. As an example of the ocean role in\n\nthe heat distribution, consider the warm equatorial waters that are carried by the Gulf\n\nStream. They travel northward along the USA coast and turn toward Europe as the\n\nNorth Atlantic Current. From there, the warm waters are picked up by the Norwegian\n\nCurrent, which bathes the Norway coast. This is why the northwestern Europe enjoys\n\na milder climate than Canada at the same latitude (e.g., Hartmann, 1994). The deep\n\nocean circulation is, on average, meridional, and it is mainly driven by density differ-\n\nences among water masses formed in the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean. Since\n\nthe density of sea water is mainly controlled by temperature and salinity, changes in\n\nthose fields lead to changes in circulation. For example, when warm tropical waters\n\nare transported to the northern North Atlantic they release heat to the atmosphere\n\nand become cold \u2014 therefore, denser than their surroundings \u2014 which leads these\n\nwaters to sink to the deep ocean. Although the temperature is usually more impor-\n\ntant in determining density, changes in salinity also affect the vertical position of a\n\nwater parcel in the water column, especially near the poles, where temperatures do\n\nnot change much. Thus, the input of freshwater coming from the melting of ice sheets\n\nand glaciers at high latitudes can affect ocean circulation (e.g., Blaschek et al., 2014).\n\nThe introduction of large amounts of meltwater has happened before in Earth\u2019s\n\nhistory. Around 20,000 years ago, continental ice sheets covered North America, the\n\nnorthern portion of Europe and part of Eurasia (Peltier, 1994). From that time until\n\nthe middle Holocene (around 6,000 years ago), these ice sheets melted, contributing\n\nto a sea level rise of ?120 m during the last 21 thousand years (Fairbanks, 1989).\n\nStudying the climate of the past, therefore, can help us understand what responses\n\nshould be expect under extreme climate changes. In order to do that, scientists use\n\nnumerical models that might explain how the observed variations in the several cli-\n\n\n\n3\n\nmate system components happened and interacted to each other. One of the many\n\ninteresting aspects of studying the Earth\u2019s past climate through numerical models is\n\nthat they give us a better understanding of the mechanisms and ranges of the climate\n\nsystem\u2019s natural variability. This comprehension allows us to improve models and\n\naccess their sensibility before trying to simulate future climate changes.\n\nThe present thesis has the main objective of evaluating the ocean responses\n\nto meltwater influxes. The specific objectives are:\n\n1. To analyze changes in the Meridional Overturning Circulation and its associated\n\ntransports of heat and salt under the influence of meltwater discharges;\n\n2. To diagnose variations in the temperature and salinity fields of the Atlantic Ocean,\n\nwhere most of the meltwater is introduced;\n\n3. To determine the distribution of the main Atlantic water masses before, during,\n\nand after meltwater discharge episodes;\n\n4. To evaluate the local impacts of a meltwater discharge in a key region to water\n\nmass formation;\n\n5. To verify the potential teleconnections of Atlantic meltwater fluxes to other oceans.\n\nIt is hypothesized that the accelerated melting of glaciers and ice sheets af-\n\nfects the ocean circulation and, consequently, the climate equilibrium. In order to\n\nreach the presented goals, the results of a transient simulation of the past 22,000\n\nyears are analyzed. Each chapter of this thesis addresses one of the specific objec-\n\ntives. In Chapter 2, the evolution of climate for the last 21,000 years is presented.\n\nChapter 3 describes the model and simulation which generated the data analyzed.\n\nChapters 4 to 7 assess the changes in the Atlantic Ocean\u2019s circulation, thermohaline\n\ncharacteristics, and water masses distribution. Chapter 8 presents some local im-\n\npacts of the meltwater presence in the Southern Ocean. Chapter 9 investigates how\n\nan ocean that is isolated from the North Atlantic \u2014 the Indian Ocean \u2014 responds to\n\nthe freshwater inputs in the Atlantic Ocean. Finally, Chapter 10 points out the main\n\nconclusions and final considerations of this thesis.\n\n\n\n4\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nClimate evolution since the Last Glacial\n\nMaximum\n\nI\nN 1941, Milankovitch proposed that the size of ice sheets was controlled by orbital\n\nvariations, which are expressed in terms of summer insolation changes at high\n\nlatitudes. Thirty-five years later, Hays et al. (1976) showed that, during the\n\nQuaternary (the last ?2.6 million years), the Earth experimented ice age cycles at\n\nsimilar intervals to the main periods of orbital variations. The Last Glacial Maximum\n\n(LGM) ended at approximately 19 ka (ka: thousands of years ago), when the summer\n\ninsolation at the Northern Hemisphere increased enough to make the ablation rates\n\nexceed the snow accumulation rates, thus triggering the melting of the large ice sheets\n\n(e.g., Milankovitch, 1941; Berger, 1978; Clark et al., 2009). The climate evolution after\n\nthis trigger, however, does not seem to have been controlled by orbital variations only,\n\nbut also by a set of internal responses of the climate system (Ruddiman, 2008). The\n\nlast deglaciation, from 19 ka to 10 ka, was the most recent natural climate change,\n\n\n\n2.1. CLIMATE STATE AT 21,000 YEARS AGO 5\n\nwhen CO2 increased by ? 70-80 ppmv. This rise is comparable to the one generated\n\nby emissions since the Industrial Revolution (Karl and Trenberth, 2003). Therefore,\n\nstudying this period of the Earth\u2019s history allows us to observe how the climate system\n\nacts and reacts to changes in its multiple components.\n\n2.1 Climate state at 21,000 years ago\n\nThe last ice age registered in proxy data1 began around 100,000 years ago (Kukla\n\net al., 2002). Its peak \u2014 when the ice sheets reached their maximum extent \u2014 was\n\naround 21 ka, period which is referred to as the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, Mix\n\net al., 2001). The LGM ended when the increasing summer insolation in the Northern\n\nHemisphere (NH) triggered the most recent deglaciation.\n\nTwenty-one thousand years ago, the Earth had mean temperatures of 4.0\u00b10.8?C\n\n(Annan and Hargreaves, 2013), the sea level was ?130 m below the present one\n\n(Clark et al., 2009), and all this missing water was stored in ice sheets that covered\n\nmost of North America (i.e., the Laurentide Ice Sheet), Northern Europe, and Eurasia.\n\nFigure 2.1 shows the extent and thickness of these ice sheets at the LGM, which are\n\nprovided by the ICE-5G data set (Peltier, 2004).\n\nFigure 2.1: Ice sheet thickness (m) given by ICE-5G (Peltier, 2004) at 21,000 years ago.\n\n1Climatic parameters, such as temperature, inferred from biotic, geological, or geochemical records.\n\n\n\n2.2. THE LAST DEGLACIATION 6\n\nThen, what would cause the Earth\u2019s climate 21 ka to be so different from the\n\npresent state? First, the presence of the ice sheets itself contributed to keep the low\n\ntemperatures, since the high albedo of the ice reflects more than absorbs the solar\n\nradiation. Second, the atmospheric GHG concentrations of these two periods are\n\nvery different. The CO2 and CH4 concentrations were ?190 ppmv and 350 ppbv at\n\nthe LGM (Monnin et al., 2001), about 68% and 40% of present levels, respectively.\n\nMoreover, Alley and Clark (1999) showed that the stronger glacial winds may have\n\ncontributed to the low temperatures through the increased mixing and upwelling in\n\nthe tropics.\n\n2.2 The last deglaciation\n\nThe last deglaciation started (around 19 ka) as soon as the summer insolation at\n\nnorthern high latitudes began to increase. The insolation increased gradually up to\n\n?12 ka, when it reached a maximum and started decreasing toward present levels\n\n(Figure 2.2(a)). This solar radiation increase is, however, small compared with the cli-\n\nmate changes observed during the deglaciation. This implies the existence of positive\n\nfeedbacks that amplify the climate system responses. In fact, variations on sea level,\n\nalbedo and GHG concentrations seem to have assumed this role (Alley and Clark,\n\n1999).\n\nThe last deglaciation was a highly variable climatic period, consisting of os-\n\ncillations with periods that go from 1,500 to 100,000 years and overlap each other, al-\n\nternating warm and cold phases. The slowest oscillations are related to Milankovitch\n\ncycles \u2014 fluctuations of the orbital parameters which determine the amount of solar\n\nradiation received at the Earth\u2019s surface. The shorter oscillations are probably re-\n\nlated to ice sheet and deep ocean circulation changes (Alley and Clark, 1999). The\n\n?1,500-year oscillations are called the Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) cycles (Bond and\n\nLotti, 1995; Bond et al., 1997), which manifest themselves through abrupt changes\n\nin temperature. After several successively colder D-O cycles, a Heinrich event may\n\n\n\n2.2. THE LAST DEGLACIATION 7\n\noccur (Heinrich, 1988; Bond et al., 1993). The Heinrich events were first described\n\nby Hartmut Heinrich (1988) and are characterized by massive iceberg discharges into\n\nthe North Atlantic. These events are identified in the geological records as sediment\n\nlayers of fast deposition. As the icebergs drift and melt, they leave behind freshwa-\n\nter and debris of variable sizes, the so-called Ice Rafted Debris (IRD) (e.g. Keigwin\n\nand Lehman, 1994). The debris sink to the bottom of the ocean and are buried after-\n\nwards, forming a distinct layer at sediment cores. The cause of the Heinrich Events\n\nis not well established, but explanations go from internal instabilities of ice sheets\n\n(MacAyeal, 1993) to increase in sea surface temperature (Marcott et al., 2011). The\n\nHeinrich events are commonly followed by abrupt warmings.\n\nFigure 2.2: (a) Insolation2, (b) Antarctic (Dome C, purple line, Jouzel et al., 2007) and\nGreenland (GISP2, green line, Alley, 2000a) temperatures, and (c) CO2 (L\u00fcthi et al., 2008)\n\nand CH4 (Loulergue et al., 2008) concentrations in the atmosphere since 21 ka.\n\n2Data obtained at ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/paleo/insolation/\n\n\n\n2.2. THE LAST DEGLACIATION 8\n\nConsidering the millennial oscillations cited above, the last deglaciation con-\n\nsisted of a sequence of five climatic periods that can be observed in the Greenland\n\nsurface air temperature (SAT) evolution, reconstructed from ice cores collected dur-\n\ning the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (Alley, 2000a, Figure 2.2(b), green line): the\n\nOldest Dryas (cold, from 19 to 14.7 ka), the B\u00f8lling (warm, from 14.7 to 14 ka), the\n\nOlder Dryas (cold, from 14 to 13.7), the Aller\u00f8d (warm, from 13.7 to 12.9 ka), and\n\nthe Younger Dryas (cold, from 12.9 to 11.7 ka)3. The Heinrich event 1 (H1) occurred\n\nduring the Oldest Dryas. Commonly, the H1 is dated from 17.5 to 16 ka based on\n\nthe layer of IRD in NH sediment cores. Stanford et al. (2011), conversely, define the\n\nHeinrich Stadial 1 in a broader sense, placing it between 19 ka and 14.6 ka. The\n\nauthors divide the H1 in three main phases: the onset of meltwater release at ?19\n\nka; the \u2019conventional\u2019 H1 IRD deposition phase starting at about 17.5 ka; and the final\n\nphase between 16.5 and ?15 ka, marked by pooling of freshwater in the Nordic Seas.\n\nBased on this broader definition, the H1 is placed in a period as long as the Oldest\n\nDryas itself. Because of that, the period between 19 ka and 14.7 will be referred to,\n\nhereafter, as H1. Moreover, since the Older Dryas was quite fast and sometimes can-\n\nnot be identified in low resolution records, this period is often omitted and the interval\n\nfrom 14.7 to 12.9 ka is merged as the B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d.\n\nHaving the above discussion in mind, here we simplify and divide the deglacia-\n\ntion in three climatic episodes that mark dramatic transitions of temperature, green-\n\nhouse gases concentration, sea level, and massive iceberg discharges. They are:\n\n\u2022 Heinrich Stadial 1 (H1): from 19 to 14.7 ka;\n\n\u2022 B\u00f8llling-Aller\u00f8d (BA): from 14.7 to 12.9 ka;\n\n\u2022 Younger Dryas (YD): from 12.9 to 11.7 ka.\n\nThe H1 marked the end of LGM with the first meltwater discharges, causing\n\nthe sea level to rapidly rise ?10-15 m at around 19 ka (Yokoyama et al., 2000). Dur-\n\ning the H1, the temperature decreased about 4?C followed by an increase of 2?3?C\n3The dates are estimates because there is still controversy about the periods\u2019 boundaries chronol-\n\nogy.\n\n\n\n2.2. THE LAST DEGLACIATION 9\n\nbefore the beginning of the BA (Figure 2.2, top). At around 14.7 ka, the BA termi-\n\nnated the H1 with a sharp air temperature increase in the Northern Hemisphere \u2014\n\n?13?C in less than 150 years (Cuffey and Clow, 1997). During the BA, a meltwater\n\ndischarge responsible for a rapid sea level rise of ?20 m in less than 150 years took\n\nplace and was named meltwater pulse 1A (MWP-1A Fairbanks, 1989). The Younger\n\nDryas followed the Aller\u00f8d with a temperature decrease of ?9?C in about 200 years,\n\nwhich made this period almost as cold as the glacial interval. During the YD, a new\n\niceberg discharge took place at the NH (the Heinrich event 0, Andrews et al., 1995)\n\naccompanied by increased freshwater fluxes in the North Atlantic. The YD ended at\n\n11.7 ka with a 5 to 10?C increase in Greenland SAT (Alley, 2000b). After that, the\n\ncomponents of the climate system stabilized, marking the beginning of the Holocene.\n\nIn total, Greenland temperatures increased by 15?C between the LGM and the late\n\nHolocene (e.g., Cuffey and Clow, 1997).\n\nThese events were observed in climate records all around the planet, almost\n\nsynchronic with the NH. However, looking at the Antarctic temperature evolution reg-\n\nistered in the Dome C ice core (Jouzel et al., 2007) it can be seen that the southern\n\nhigh latitudes behave quite differently than their northern counterpart (Figure 2.2(b),\n\npurple line). Blunier and Brook (2001) showed that, in the last 90,000 years, signifi-\n\ncant increases in Greenland temperature were preceded by Antarctica by 1,500-3,000\n\nyears \u2014 interval that coincides with the period of the D-O oscillations. Because of\n\nthat, it is possible to observe a phase opposition between Greenland and Antarctica\n\ntemperature time series, which means that warm periods in one place coincide with\n\ncold periods in the other one. This behaviour is known as bipolar seesaw (Broecker\n\net al., 1998), but it is not exactly symmetric around the equator. While the \"northern\n\nbehaviour\" is observed broadly around the world, the \"southern behaviour\" is only\n\nobserved in the South Atlantic, Central Indian and Deep Pacific Ocean (Alley and\n\nClark, 1999). It is believed that the \"southern behaviour\" is transmitted through the\n\nocean along hundreds of years, while the \"northern behaviour\" is transmitted via at-\n\nmosphere, allowing the observed global synchronicity (Alley and Clark, 1999).\n\n\n\n2.3. THE HOLOCENE 10\n\nFigure 2.2(c) shows the temporal evolution of two important greenhouse gases:\n\nCO2 and CH4. The CO2 concentrations rise in a two-step fashion: from the early H1\n\n(?17 ka) to the beginning of the BA (14.7 ka) and from the end of the BA (12.9 ka)\n\nto the end of YD (11.7 ka), when it reaches interglacial levels. CH 4 concentrations\n\nalso start to rise around 17 ka and jump abruptly from ?450 to 640 ppbv during the\n\nBA, followed by a sharp decrease back to ?450 ppbv at the YD (12.9 ka). At the end\n\nof the YD, CH4 concentrations jump to 650 ppbv again. An interesting feature pointed\n\nby Alley and Clark (1999) can be observed in these time series: CO2 variations follow\n\nHeinrich events because these events affect especially ocean processes which, in\n\nturn, control atmospheric CO2 concentrations. On the other hand, CH4 oscillates with\n\nD-O events, because one of the main sources of CH4 \u2014 the wetlands \u2014 are closely\n\nrelated to the monsoonal regime, which is affected by the temperature swings that\n\ncharacterize D-O events.\n\n2.3 The Holocene\n\nDuring the deglaciation, the large amplitude of climate variability is attributed to the\n\npresence of huge ice sheets, which amplify climatic responses (e.g., Mayewski et al.,\n\n2004). In the Holocene, however, most of the ice sheets had melted and the main\n\nforcing of climate variations became the seasonal contrast of incoming solar radiation\n\n(Bond et al., 2001). This contrast was reflected on changes in the hydrological cycle\n\nand monsoonal systems (Otto-Bliesner et al., 2006; Mayewski et al., 2004) which,\n\nin turn, were expressed in surface changes in vegetation, lake levels in Asia and\n\nnorthern Africa, and expansion of the boreal forest at the expense of tundra at mid-\n\nto high latitudes of the NH (Prentice and Jolly, 2000). Although the climatic variability\n\nduring the Holocene is fairly stable when compared to the one during the deglaciation,\n\nthere are some characteristics and episodes that are worth mentioning.\n\nBond et al. (1997) recognized eight cold events during the Holocene: at 11.1\n\nka, 10.3 ka, 9.4 ka, 8.2 ka, 5.9 ka, 4.2 ka, 2.8 ka and 1.4 ka. The authors discuss\n\n\n\n2.3. THE HOLOCENE 11\n\nthat the probable cause for these events was an ocean surface cooling brought by\n\nchanges in North Atlantic\u2019s surface circulation. The most notable event is the 8.2\n\nka one, when climatic deviations were about half as large as those of the YD (Alley\n\net al., 1997). Around this time, the temperatures cooled by 3?-6?C over Greenland\n\nand the snow accumulation decreased 20% (Alley et al., 1997). Another cold event,\n\nwhich happened around 400 years ago, was called the Little Ice Age and followed\n\nthe Medieval warm period. Several of those Holocene cold events led to the collapse\n\nand reconstruction of human civilizations (Mayewski et al., 2004). The last major\n\nmeltwater discharges occurred with the melting of the remaining Eurasian Ice Sheet\n\n(around 8 ka) and Laurentide Ice Shees (around 7 ka, Carlson et al., 2008).\n\n\n\n12\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nThe transient simulation TraCE-21K\n\nN\nUMERICAL models provide \"full-picture\" scenarios when observations cover\n\nonly punctual locations and times. In the past decades, several numerical\n\nstudies determined the paleocean state for specific time slices. Here, with\n\nthe aid of advanced computational resources, we use the results of the first transient\n\nsimulation of the last 22,000 years (called TraCE-21K), based on the NCAR-CCSM3\n\nmodel. With prescribed greenhouse gas concentrations in atmosphere, insolation lev-\n\nels, meltwater fluxes that resemble sea level rise records, and changes in ice sheets\n\nand coast lines configuration, the simulation successfully reproduced the main cli-\n\nmatic periods since the Last Glacial Maximum.\n\n3.1 NCAR-CCSM3 numeric model\n\nThe Climate Community System Model (CCSM) is a global coupled model developed\n\nat the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). It is composed of four com-\n\n\n\n3.2. TRACE-21K SETTINGS 13\n\nponents: atmosphere, ocean, land surface and sea ice (Boville and Gent, 1998). The\n\natmospheric component of this model is the Community Atmospheric Model (CAM)\n\nversion 3 with a ?3.75?in horizontal resolution and 26 hybrid coordinate levels in the\n\nvertical (Collins et al., 2006). The land model uses the same resolution as the atmo-\n\nspheric model, and allows the user to specify glaciers, lakes, wetlands, urban areas,\n\nand vegetated regions.\n\nThe ocean component of this model is the Parallel Ocean Program (POP), a\n\nthree-dimensional primitive equation model in vertical z-coordinate (Gent et al., 2006).\n\nThe ocean grid has a dislocated north pole over Greenland, and 25 levels extending to\n\n5.5 km depth. Its horizontal resolution is approximately 3.6?in longitude and is variable\n\nalong latitudes, with greater resolution in the tropics and North Atlantic. The sea ice\n\nmodel uses the same horizontal grid and land mask as the ocean model, and has a\n\ndynamic\u2013thermodynamic formulation, which includes a sub-grid-scale ice thickness\n\ndistribution and elastic\u2013viscous\u2013plastic rheology (Briegleb et al., 2004).\n\n3.2 TraCE-21K settings\n\nThe simulation analyzed is referred to as TraCE-21K, and it is the final result of sev-\n\neral sensitive experiments generated by He (2011) in his effort to constrain meltwater\n\nflux rates and locations that best reproduced Greenland SAT records, the Atlantic\n\nMeridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strength reconstructions, and other proxy\n\ndata. The final run spans from 22 ka to 0 ka, which includes the LGM, all the main\n\nclimatic events of the last deglaciation, and the Holocene. The present day (0 ka) in\n\nthe simulation represents year 1950. He (2011) explains that at each millenial event,\n\nseveral sensitive experiments were performed with the same initial condition, but dif-\n\nferent meltwater schemes in terms of rates and location of meltwater discharge. After\n\ntaking into consideration the sea level records, indicators of the meridional ocean cir-\n\nculation strength, and Greenland temperature records, he chose the experiment that\n\nbest matched the proxy data to continue the transient run (see Figure 3.1). TraCE-21K\n\n\n\n3.2. TRACE-21K SETTINGS 14\n\nis an extended version of the DGL-A experiment discussed in Liu et al. (2009).\n\nFigure 3.1: Schematic of the strategy for TraCE-21K. At the beginning of each important\nclimatic event, several sensitive experiments were performed with different meltwater\n\nschemes. The most successful experiment reproducing proxy data was chosen to continue\nthe transient run. Figure adapted from He (2011).\n\nThe TraCE-21K run was initialized using the results of the LGM CCSM3 sim-\n\nulation described by Otto-Bliesner et al. (2006). The LGM CCSM3 has prescribed\n\nconcentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases based on ice core measurements\n\n(Fl\u00fcckiger et al., 1999; D\u00e4llenbach et al., 2000; Inderm\u00fchle et al., 2000) and are given\n\nin Otto-Bliesner et al. (2006, their Table 1) as are the atmospheric aerosols. The con-\n\ncentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide\n\n(N2O) are reduced compared to the pre-industrial values, resulting in a total decrease\n\nin radiative forcing of the troposphere of 2.76 Wm2. The majority of this change (2.22\n\nWm2) results from a decrease in the amount of CO2. Continental ice sheet extent\n\nand topography in the LGM CCSM3 simulation come from the ICE-5G reconstruction\n\n(Peltier, 2004). The coastline is also taken from the ICE-5G reconstruction and cor-\n\nresponds to a sea level ?120 m below the present one. The orbital parameters at\n\n21 ka (Berger, 1978) are used to determine the total solar flux. The LGM CCSM3\n\nocean was initialized by applying anomalies of the ocean three-dimensional poten-\n\ntial temperature and salinity fields derived from a LGM run with the Climate System\n\nModel version 1.4 (CSM1.4, Shin, 2003). Starting the simulation with a previous LGM\n\nrun that reached quasi-equilibrium allows a shorter spin-up phase. The LGM CCSM3\n\nequilibrium was run coupled to a vegetation module (CLM-DGVM, Levis et al., 2004)\n\nfor 1800 years before initializing the TraCE-21K simulation.\n\nThe initial fields present a colder and saltier deep ocean compared to the\n\npresent-day thermohaline structure, which is in agreement with previous studies (Ad-\n\n\n\n3.2. TRACE-21K SETTINGS 15\n\nkins et al., 2002). The North Atlantic, in particular, presents a very dense vertical\n\nprofile in the subsurface and deep ocean, which gives the LGM ocean its highly strat-\n\nified characteristic. For the prescribed forcing fields, TraCE-21K adopted transient\n\norbital parameters and transient greenhouse gases concentrations (CO2, CH4 and\n\nN2O) from Joos and Spahni (2008). The ice sheets volume changed every 500 years\n\naccording to ICE-5G reconstruction (Peltier, 2004). The coastlines were also taken\n\nfrom ICE-5G and were modified at 13.1 ka (removal of the Fennoscadian Ice Sheet\n\nfrom the Barents Sea), 12.9 ka (opening of the Bering Strait), 7.6 ka (opening of Hud-\n\nson Bay), and 6.2 ka (opening of the Indonesian throughflow). The changes in the\n\ncoastlines also reflects the sea level variability.\n\nThe meltwater scheme (summarized in Figure 3.2(a)) and their locations\n\n(shown in Figure 3.2(b)) for this simulation are detailed in the Table 3.1. The melt-\n\nwater flux rates were chosen based on sea level records presented in Clark and Mix\n\n(2002) and Peltier (2004), and on geological indicators of ice sheet retreat and melt-\n\nwater discharge from Licciardi et al. (1999), Clark et al. (2001, 2002a), Clark et al.\n\n(2004), and Carlson (2009). As the sea level records do not constrain the locations\n\nwhere the meltwater fluxes come from, these locations were chosen according to the\n\nAMOC sensitivity to freshwater input in that particular region. There is a trend of\n\nlower sensitivity of the AMOC to the meltwater forcing in more southerly latitudes.\n\nTherefore, the Beaufort Sea/Mackenzie River discharge, Nordic Sea and 50?- 70?N\n\nof North Atlantic are the three regions with larger sensitivity, while the sensitivity of\n\nthe Southern Ocean is very small (He, 2011).\n\nThe meltwater discharges were added to the ocean model as a freshwater\n\nflux to the ocean surface (He, 2011). This allows the low salinity signal to spread\n\nfreely in the global ocean. The freshwater flux rate applied on each grid cell of the\n\nchosen region was obtained by dividing the corresponding sea level rise by the total\n\narea where the freshwater was inserted. The unit for the meltwater discharge is given\n\nin m/kyr (meters of equivalent sea level volume per thousand years). Since the area\n\nof the ocean is about 3.61x1014 m2, 1 m/kyr means 3.61x1014m3 volume of meltwater\n\n\n\n3.2.

The idea of the causal link between MWP-1A and Older Dryas cooling has\n\nbeen also proposed based on proxy records (Stanford et al., 2006).

SIMULATION PERFORMANCE 19\n\n3.3 Simulation performance\n\nHe (2011) points out that between H1 and the onset of BA the sea level stabilized,\n\nwhich suggests a minimal meltwater discharge during this period. Yet, even with\n\nno meltwater input, the AMOC remained at a near-collapse state during this period,\n\nwhich could be explained invoking AMOC hysteresis (e.g., Hofmann and Rahmstorf,\n\n2009; Hawkins et al., 2011). Because CCSM3 has a weak AMOC hysteresis (Liu\n\net al., 2009), it was necessary to induce substantial sea level rise in order to maintain\n\na near-collapsed AMOC between H1 and BA.\n\nAt the onset of BA, the Greenland SAT increases by about 13?C in the simu-\n\nlation, which is in good agreement with SAT georeconstructions in terms of amplitude.\n\nHowever, the rate of the simulated Greenland warming is ?40% slower than that from\n\nreconstructions: the simulation takes about 350 years to increase Greenlands\u2019s tem-\n\nperature by 13?C, while the reconstructions suggest that this abrupt warming took\n\nonly ?200 years to happen (He, 2011).\n\nProxy data indicate that the AMOC did not collapse during the YD, which im-\n\nplies that the AMOC reduction during YD is smaller than during H1. In the simulation,\n\nthe maximum meltwater discharge rate that allowed AMOC to weaken but not shut-\n\ndown was 10 m/kyr. This meltwater flux led to a cooling of merely 2?C, compared to\n\nthe 8?10?C cooling on Greenland SAT reconstructions. Even with a larger meltwa-\n\nter discharge and a collapsed AMOC, the temperature decreases only by 3-5?C. He\n\n(2011) explains that, besides AMOC strength, the only other change observed during\n\nthis period that could be involved in YD cooling was in the coastline configuration: the\n\nBering Strait was opened at 12.9 ka. Although the opening of the Bering Strait indeed\n\nshowed a contribution for a weaker AMOC, its effect on temperature reduction was\n\nminimal. Therefore, TraCE-21K could not reproduce all the cooling of Younger Dryas.\n\nBesides, with the opening of the Bering Strait at 12.9 ka, the termination of meltwa-\n\nter flux at the end of the YD fails to produce the abrupt warming during the YD-early\n\nHolocene transition (He, 2011).\n\nEven though AMOC and Greenland SAT reconstructions show a complete\n\n\n\n3.3. SIMULATION PERFORMANCE 20\n\ntransition to Holocene by 10 ka, He (2011) opted to keep meltwater discharges in\n\nthe NH between 10 and 7 ka in order to respect sea level records and geological\n\nindicators of ice sheet retreat. As a result, the simulated Greenland SAT is significantly\n\ncooler than reconstructions between 10 and 7 ka. Once the meltwater was shutdown,\n\nthe temperatures reached Holocene levels, which agrees with reconstructions and\n\nmodern observations.\n\nDespite the above considerations, the simulation reproduced most of the ma-\n\njor climatic events of the last deglaciation, suggesting a good agreement in climate\n\nsensitivity between the model and observations (Liu et al., 2009). He (2011) highlights\n\nthat, since TraCE-21K started from the LGM and integrated forward with prescribed\n\nGHG concentrations and orbital forcing, the successful simulation of the Holocene\n\ntemperatures shows that CCSM3 responds adequately to the radiative forcing.\n\n\n\n21\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nThe Atlantic Ocean\u2019s deglacial evolution:\n\nIntroduction\n\n4.1 Present-day structure of the deep ocean circula-\n\ntion\n\nOceanic motion is driven primarily by two types of forcing: wind stress and buoyancy.\n\nIn the upper ? 100 m of the water column, the winds drive horizontal gyres. The\n\nAtlantic Ocean has two subtropical gyres (one in each hemisphere), one subpolar\n\ngyre in the North Atlantic, and an equatorial system (Figure 4.1). In the Atlantic sector\n\nof the Southern Ocean, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current flows eastward. Due to the\n\nconservation of potential vorticity, the western boundary currents (WBC) of the gyres\n\nare intense and narrow, while the eastern ones are weak (Talley et al., 2011).\n\nBetween 1000 and 1500 m, the intermediate depth circulation is forced by Ek-\n\nman pumping (upwelling and downwelling) generated by wind friction on the surface\n\n\n\n4.1. PRESENT-DAY STRUCTURE OF THE DEEP OCEAN CIRCULATION 22\n\nlayers (Talley et al., 2011).\n\nFigure 4.1: Simplified scheme of Atlantic Ocean circulation near the surface driven by winds.\n\nAt greater depths, the circulation is mostly forced by buoyancy. The flow in\n\nthe ocean interior is generally weak and easily masked by the eddy field and the\n\ndeep WBCs (DWBCs) which extend to the bottom - although with reduced strength.\n\nThe DWBCs in the Atlantic Ocean are the main carriers of newly formed deep waters\n\n(Stommel, 1958). The northern DWBC carries North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW)\n\nsouthward at the 2500 m level, while the southern DWBC carries Antarctic Bottom\n\nWater (AABW) northward, offshore of and deeper than the NADW\u2019s DWBC (Hogg\n\nand Owens, 1999). Since DWBCs are the most energetic part of the deep circulation\n\n(Talley et al., 2011), the deep flows are essentially meridional when averaged over a\n\nlong time. A schematic representation of this circulation is shown in Figure 4.2.\n\nThe present-day configuration of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circu-\n\nlation (AMOC) comprises two cells. The upper cell consists of surface warm waters\n\nthat flow northward, loose heat to the atmosphere in the northern North Atlantic, and\n\n\n\n4.1. PRESENT-DAY STRUCTURE OF THE DEEP OCEAN CIRCULATION 23\n\nsink as North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), which travels southward around 3000\n\nm of depth until ?40?S. The lower cell, in turn, is composed by the NADW flowing\n\nsouthward, mixing with other water masses, upwelling near 50?S and sinking off the\n\nAntarctic shelf as Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), which spreads northward up to the\n\nequator (Johnson, 2008). The AMOC carries heat and freshwater across the Atlantic,\n\nwhich is why it is intimately associated with the climate variability.\n\nFigure 4.2: Simplified scheme of the modern Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation\n(zonally averaged). The North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) sinks in the northern North\n\nAtlantic, travels southward, and upwells in the subtropical front, when it mixes with the newly\nformed Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). From there, NADW can go northward, towards the\nAntarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) formation region, or southward, becoming a part of the\nAABW formation. AABW travels northward near the ocean bottom and eventually mixes with\n\nNADW in its lower part.\n\nThe observation of this meridional circulation, however, is not easily done be-\n\ncause of the difficulties in measuring the slow velocities in the ocean interior. Much\n\nof what is known about the deep ocean circulation today has been inferred from the\n\ndistribution of sea water properties, especially temperature and salinity. This indi-\n\nrect analysis is possible based on the concept that the properties of a certain parcel\n\nof water are originally acquired at the ocean surface in its formation region. Since\n\ntemperature and salinity are considered to be fairly conservative properties (i.e., only\n\nchange at the surface), they function as a signature that allow us to trace the origin\n\n(where the parcel intercepts the ocean surface) and dispersion of this water parcel.\n\nFigure 4.3 shows the vertical salinity profile for the Atlantic obtained with data\n\n\n\n4.1. PRESENT-DAY STRUCTURE OF THE DEEP OCEAN CIRCULATION 24\n\nfrom the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE, http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/woce/).\n\nOne can compare this profile with the schematic circulation provided in Figure 4.2 and\n\nsee that, indeed, salinity is a good tracer for water masses distribution.\n\nHere we define water type and water mass following Tomczak and Large\n\n(1989):\n\n\u2022 Water type: a point in hydrographic parameter space (i.e., each hydrographic\n\nproperty has a single value); it represents the original properties of the water\n\nmass, acquired in its formation region (before mixing with other water masses);\n\n\u2022 Water mass: collection of water parcels that have a common formation his-\n\ntory; they are defined by their mean hydrographic properties plus a standard\n\ndeviation.\n\nFigure 4.3: Vertical section at 25?W for the Atlantic Ocean salinity field using data from\nWOCE (http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/woce/).\n\nAny water mass can be represented by a finite number of water types. In\n\nother words, each water mass is characterized by small fluctuations around a prop-\n\nerty extreme. The AABW, for example, has a temperature minimum signature, while\n\nthe NADW\u2019s signature is a salinity maximum at depth. The Antarctic Intermediate\n\nWater (AAIW) is characterized by a salinity minimum signature. NADW\u2019s high salinity\n\n\n\n4.2. DEEP OCEAN CIRCULATION CHANGES IN THE LAST 21,000 YEARS 25\n\nderives from Gulf of Mexico waters and from eddies that form from the Mediterranean\n\nSea overflow (both with high salinity as a result of the excess of evaporation over pre-\n\ncipitation). The temperature minimum characteristic of AABW is due to the freezing\n\nwaters involved in the formation process of this water mass on the Antarctic conti-\n\nnental shelf. AAIW has different formation theories, but its low salt content is either\n\nassociated with the fresher Pacific waters that enter the South Atlantic via the Drake\n\nPassage or with the excess of precipitation over evaporation around 50?S.\n\n4.2 Deep ocean circulation changes in the last 21,000\n\nyears\n\nWith a significant fraction of water stored in the form of ice, the oceans\u2019 mean salinity\n\nat the LGM was higher than today. Adkins et al. (2002) showed that, at this time, the\n\nwaters coming from the Southern Ocean filled the deep Atlantic basin and were char-\n\nacterized by salinities of ? 35.8 compared to the current ?34.7. The increased salinity\n\nis commonly attributed to the enhanced sea ice formation and extension 21,000 years\n\nago (Liu, 2005; Shin, 2003). Adkins (2013) points out another factor that could have\n\ncontributed to the elevated salinity: the warm deep water of northern origin was colder\n\nat the LGM, which could have led to a reduced basal melting of ice shelves and, con-\n\nsequently, a lack of freshwater input in the Southern Ocean waters. The increased\n\nsalinity of deep waters and the low temperatures of the ocean determined a distinct\n\ndynamic behaviour compared to the present day one. At the LGM, the vertical ocean\n\nmovements were determined by differences in salinity rather than temperature (Ad-\n\nkins et al., 2002), which happens today only in high latitudes or regions under the\n\ninfluence of river runoff. The presence of salty waters near the bottom added to the\n\nreduced vertical mixing rates (e.g. Adkins, 2013; Ferrari et al., 2014) resulted in a\n\nhighly stratified and stable ocean, which reduced the communication between the two\n\ncells that compose the AMOC (Ferrari et al., 2014).\n\nDue to the expansion of AABW at the LGM, the boundary between the south-\n\n\n\n4.2. DEEP OCEAN CIRCULATION CHANGES IN THE LAST 21,000 YEARS 26\n\nern and the northern water masses was around ? 2000 m (Figure 4.4), compared\n\nto the average ?4000 m at present (Oppo and Lehman, 1993; Curry and Oppo,\n\n2005; Ferrari et al., 2014). Back in the 1980s, some studies had already pointed\n\nto a shoaling of the glacial version of NADW (Boyle and Keigwin, 1987; Duplessy\n\net al., 1988). Today, it is widely accepted that this shoaling indeed happened (e.g.,\n\nOppo and Lehman, 1993; Marchitto et al., 1998; Sarnthein et al., 2001; Curry and\n\nOppo, 2005; Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 2007; Otto-Bliesner et al., 2007; Praetorius et al.,\n\n2008; Lippold et al., 2012), which led the scientific community to rename the early\n\nNADW as Glacial North Atlantic Intermediate Water (GNAIW). Based on proxy data,\n\nBoyle and Keigwin (1987) further suggested that GNAIW would have been colder and\n\nfresher than NADW.\n\nFigure 4.4: Simplified scheme of the glacial Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation,\nfollowing the descriptions in Curry and Oppo (2005); Ferrari et al. (2014). The studies\n\nsuggest that the Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) occupied most of the Atlantic basin during\nthe last glacial period, forming an almost closed lower cell \u2014 since the stratification was\n\nstronger and the vertical mixing was reduced. In the intermediate layers, besides the\nAntarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW), there was an intermediate water mass formed in the\n\nnorthern North Atlantic called Glacial Intermediate North Atlantic Water (GNAIW), that flowed\nsouthward.\n\nIt is believed that the climate swings that followed the LGM were frequently\n\naccompanied by changes in the ocean circulation (e.g., Broecker, 1994; McManus\n\net al., 2004; Praetorius et al., 2008). Proxy records show that during cold periods there\n\nwere reductions in the AMOC while the warm periods were marked by the AMOC\u2019s\n\n\n\n4.2. DEEP OCEAN CIRCULATION CHANGES IN THE LAST 21,000 YEARS 27\n\nrecovery (McManus et al., 2004; Came et al., 2008; Ritz et al., 2013, see more details\n\nin section 5.1).\n\nConcerning the AAIW, there is still some controversy about how much this\n\nwater mass penetrated into the North Atlantic during the last deglaciation. Some\n\nstudies suggest that AAIW could have reached as far north as 60?N (Rickaby and\n\nElderfield, 2005), while others believe this water mass did not reach the subtropical\n\nNorth Atlantic (Xie et al., 2012). Also, the ?13C signature of AAIW in Makou et al.\n\n(2010) points to a reduced contact with the atmosphere during glacial AAIW formation,\n\nlikely due to the presence of sea ice in the region.\n\nThe next three chapters present the results obtained from the analysis of\n\nTraCE-21K data concerning the deep Atlantic Ocean circulation. Chapter 5 shows\n\nthe variability of the AMOC since the LGM and its associated heat and salt trans-\n\nports. Chapter 6 describes how the temperature and salinity fields changed during the\n\ndeglaciation. Chapter 7 presents the water masses distribution across the Atlantic in\n\ndifferent important periods. This chapter begins by describing the methodology used\n\nto obtain the distribution of water masses \u2014 the mixing triangle technique, described\n\nby Mamayev (1975).\n\n\n\n28\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\nThe Atlantic Ocean\u2019s deglacial evolution:\n\nMeridional transports\n\n5.1 The AMOC\n\nEither (or both) proxy and model data have been widely used in the effort to recon-\n\nstruct the geometry and strength of the AMOC at the LGM and on (e.g., Duplessy\n\net al., 1988; Yu et al., 1996; Shin et al., 2003; Paul and Schafer-Neth, 2003; Weaver\n\net al., 2003; McManus et al., 2004; Curry and Oppo, 2005; Otto-Bliesner et al., 2006;\n\nStouffer et al., 2006; Clauzet et al., 2007; Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 2007; Otto-Bliesner\n\net al., 2007; Came et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009; Brady and Otto-Bliesner, 2010; Lip-\n\npold et al., 2012; Wainer et al., 2012; Ritz et al., 2013). The results of the numerous\n\nstudies are, however, far from unanimous. Some studies that used proxy records to\n\nestimate the intensity of the AMOC point to a vigorous circulation (at least, as strong\n\nas today) at the LGM (e.g. Yu et al., 1996; Roberts et al., 2010; Lippold et al., 2012).\n\n\n\n5.1. THE AMOC 29\n\nOthers \u2014 sometimes using the same proxies as the studies just cited \u2014 interpret the\n\ndata as a sign of a slower AMOC (e.g. McManus et al., 2004; Negre et al., 2010). In a\n\ncomprehensive review of several proxy data, Lynch-Stieglitz et al. (2007) believe that\n\nthe middle path is the best bet: the AMOC was neither stronger nor much slower than\n\ntoday. The authors point out that in several sediment cores no significant difference\n\nwas found between tracers deposited during the LGM and today, which is consistent\n\nwith a range of past circulation states (from a slight increase in the AMOC to a de-\n\ncrease of up to 30%). Either way, there seems to be a general agreement about the\n\nrelationship between AMOC intensity and D-O cycles: AMOC experienced a weaken-\n\ning during Heinrich Stadials (more intense during the H1 than during the YD), followed\n\nby rapid increases concurrent with regional warming events during the last deglacia-\n\ntion (McManus et al., 2004; Stanford et al., 2006; Gherardi et al., 2009; Bohm et al.,\n\n2014).\n\nHere, TraCE-21K data point to an intensified AMOC at the LGM (Figure\n\n5.1(a)). The upper cell of the overturning is homogeneously strong in both hemi-\n\nspheres while the lower cell shows a vigorous Southern Hemisphere circulation, as-\n\nsociated with the intensified AABW formation, occupying most of the deep Atlantic\n\nbasin. During the H1 (Figure 5.1(b)), the intensified lower cell is still present with the\n\nmaximum transport of 8\u201310 Sv confined south of 25?S. The upper cell changes signif-\n\nicantly, becoming consistently weaker in both hemispheres. The maximum transport\n\n(?10 Sv) at about 1000 m at the LGM is significantly reduced in H1 (max ?4 Sv).\n\nDuring the BA (Figure 5.1(c)) and MPW-1A (Figure 5.1(d)), the deeper circulation of\n\nthe lower cell weakens while the upper cell intensifies. In the BA, there is an inten-\n\nsification of about 4\u20136 Sv centered at 1000 m between 20\u201340?N that is not seen in\n\nFigure 5.1(d). The Antarctic Bottom Water picks up again during YD, which is respon-\n\nsible for the re-intensification of the lower cell of the meridional overturning (Figure\n\n5.1(e)), while the upper cell is weakened \u2013\u2013 except in the upper few hundred meters\n\ncentered at 20?N. The configuration of the meridional overturning for the Holocene is\n\nshown in Figure 5.1(f).\n\n\n\n5.1. THE AMOC 30\n\nLiu et al. (2009), analyzing the TraCE-21K AMOC variability from the LGM\n\nto the BA, found that the BA warming is a response to the sudden interruption of\n\nmeltwater flux in the North Atlantic at 14.67 ka. This interruption stimulated AMOC\n\nto recover and get back to its glacial state (?12.5 Sv, increasing Greenland SAT by\n\n?5?C) and overshoot (to 19 Sv, contributing to rise the temperature by other 10?C; Liu\n\net al., 2009). The authors explain that the overshoot could be caused by convective\n\ninstability in the Nordic Sea added to a deep-ocean warming scenario. He (2011)\n\npoints out that the rate and final amplitude of the AMOC resumption is dependent\n\non the history of meltwater forcing, with faster recovery and larger AMOC overshoot\n\nin cases where the meltwater discharge took longer to cease. Moreover, Liu et al.\n\n(2009) note that there is almost a linear dependence of Greenland SAT variations on\n\nAMOC strength, supporting that AMOC is essential for the temperature control during\n\nthe deglaciation.\n\nThe results suggest that, in CCSM3, the AMOC has multiple equilibria and\n\ngoes from one state to the other through meltwater discharges onto the ocean surface.\n\nFigure 5.1: Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation streamfunction and associated\ntransports at six different periods: (a) LGM, (b) H1, (c) BA, (d) MWP-1A, (e) YD, and (f)\n\nHolocene. Figure from Marson et al. (2014).\n\n\n\n5.2. MERIDIONAL HEAT AND SALT TRANSPORT 31\n\n5.2 Meridional heat and salt transport\n\nIn contrast to the Pacific Ocean, where the heat is transported from the equator to\n\nthe poles, the meridional heat transport in the South Atlantic is directed northward.\n\nThis happens because the upper branch of the AMOC carries warm surface layer\n\nwaters northward to compensate for the outflow of cold waters from the deep North\n\nAtlantic (Seidov and Maslin, 2001). Therefore, studying the South Atlantic circulation\n\nis instrumental to fully understand the Earth\u2019s climate system.\n\nThe meridional heat transport was calculated as in Bryan (1962) through a\n\nsection of the Atlantic basin, using the equation 5.1.\n\nQt =\n\n0?\n5000m\n\n20W?\n70W\n\ncp ?? v dxdz (5.1)\n\nwhere Qt is the meridional heat transport, cp is the sensible heat of seawater,\n\n? is seawater density, v is the meridional velocity and ? is the potential temperature.\n\nThe meridional salt transport was calculated in the same way, simply substituting cp?\n\nby S, where S is the salinity of seawater.\n\nThe northern ocean heat transport (NOHT) for the South Atlantic (0\u201330?S) is\n\nshown in Figure 5.2(a) (purple curve). Apart from the cold LGM period, positive val-\n\nues \u2013 which indicate northward transport \u2013 coincide with warm periods in the Northern\n\nHemisphere. A sharp increase of the NOHT at ?14.7 ka (which coincides with the\n\nB\u00f8lling\u2013Aller\u00f8d (BA) warming in the north) is evident. The heat transport is higher at\n\nLGM than at modern times, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the AMOC\n\nwas stronger at 21 ka as discussed by Shin (2003) and Clauzet et al. (2007). Near-\n\nzero and negative meridional heat transport are associated with the Northern Hemi-\n\nsphere cooling relative to the H1 and Younger Dryas (YD) events, while the temper-\n\nature increases in the Southern Hemisphere. After 11 ka, the heat transport values\n\nshow a steady, small rise to about 0.25-0.3 PW until about 6 ka after which it remains\n\npractically constant at that level, indicating a stable equilibrium at the same time that\n\nthe meltwater pulses are shutdown in the simulation.\n\n\n\n5.2.

MERIDIONAL HEAT AND SALT TRANSPORT 33\n\nThe NOHT as a function of latitude averaged for each of the key millenial\n\nevents in the simulation is shown in Figure 5.2(b). NOHT has a maximum in the\n\nNorth Atlantic in the tropics, centered at 20?N for the LGM and BA. This maximum\n\nshifts a few degrees north for the MWP-1A period. For the YD and Holocene, the\n\nmaximum northward transport is at about 25?S and 30?S, respectively. The changes\n\nin magnitude of the NOHT between the periods are related to air\u2013sea interaction in\n\nthe tropics as discussed by Cheng et al. (2007). They discuss the AMOC slowdown,\n\nthe related NOHT and the mechanisms for the high-latitude tropical coupling through\n\nfreshwater perturbation experiments. In the South Atlantic, with exception of the YD,\n\nthe transport is northward, largest at LGM, decreasing nonlinearly at BA and MWP-1A\n\nand very small for H1 and the Holocene.\n\nThe northward ocean salt transport (NOST) as a function of latitude is shown\n\nin Figure 5.2(c). The NOST between the key millenial events shows its maximum\n\nvalues between 30\u201340?N with a secondary maximum at 10?S. In the North Atlantic,\n\nthe ocean salt transport is southward for all periods (except the Holocene) from the\n\nEquator to about 20?N, after which it becomes poleward until 60?N, when it reverts to\n\nsouthward. The strongest NOST is during H1, followed by BA, LGM and YD. During\n\nthe Holocene with the exception of a small, albeit positive, NOST at about 38?N, all\n\nthe salt transport is southward. In the South Atlantic, there is northward salt transport\n\nat H1, BA and LGM, which is reversed southward at YD and Holocene.\n\nThe relationship between the TraCE-21K meridional heat transport and the\n\nmeridional salt transport (Figure 5.2(a), green curve) shows an out-of-phase behavior\n\nbetween the two time series. This is best illustrated by the scatter diagram in Figure\n\n5.3. It shows that the negative correlations between heat and salt transport are high\n\nbefore and after the BA warming period (circles with a correlation coefficient (r) of\n\n-0.99, and triangles with r = -0.93, respectively). During the transition from approxi-\n\nmately 14.7 ka to 12.9 ka, the correlation diminishes (but is still significant; Fig. 5.3,\n\ncrosses with r = -0.79) due to the reorganization of the deep ocean structure. The\n\ndifferent slopes of the circle and triangle clusters in Fig. 5.3 indicate that, overall, the\n\n\n\n5.2. MERIDIONAL HEAT AND SALT TRANSPORT 34\n\ntransport exhibits two regimes: a large heat and small salt transport before BA and a\n\nsmall heat and large salt transport especially after YD (greenish to reddish tones).\n\nFigure 5.3: Scatter diagram showing negative correlation between heat and salt transport in\nSouth Atlantic (30\u20130?S). The circles represent the data for the period that precede the\n\nB\u00f8lling\u2013Aller\u00f8d event; the crosses stand for the BA period; and the triangles show data from\nYounger Dryas on. The colors stand for time evolution, according to the color bar on the right.\n\nFigure from Marson et al. (2014).\n\nIf we consider the salt transport via water masses, the AABW fills the Atlantic\n\nbasin from LGM to BA due to the limited extension of GNAIW. After that, the devel-\n\noping NADW starts transporting salt southward, and at the same time there is more\n\nheat being transported to the north (as in Seidov and Maslin, 2001). The same is true\n\nfor AABW at the beginning of the simulation (more glacial AABW means export of salt\n\nnorthward and more heat southward). The increase or decrease in NOHT and NOST\n\nis related to the location of the prescribed freshwater fluxes. For example, the MWP-\n\n1A that discharged the equivalent of 15 m/kyr of freshwater into the Southern Ocean,\n\nwhere the AABW is formed, would cause its North Atlantic counterpart to transport\n\nsalt southward more intensely. According to Seidov and Maslin (2001), for example, a\n\nstronger NADW is associated with increased northward heat transport, and more salt\n\ntransported to the south, leading to an inverse correlation.\n\n\n\n35\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\nThe Atlantic Ocean\u2019s deglacial evolution:\n\nThermohaline characteristics\n\nT\nHE analysis of the Atlantic\u2019s salinity and temperature fields reveals changes\n\nin its water masses that occurred in the transient simulation. As we will\n\nsee, several of those changes agree with proxy reconstructions discussed\n\nin section 4.2. We begin presenting the salinity vertical sections, since salinity is\n\na good tracer of the vertical distribution of water masses in the Atlantic Ocean (as\n\nmentioned in section 4.1).\n\nThe Atlantic Ocean at LGM (Figure 6.1(a)) was much more stratified than to-\n\nday (e.g. Adkins et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2014) with the dense (and salty) AABW oc-\n\ncupying much of the deep basin, as discussed before. During the H1 (Figure 6.1(b)),\n\nthe slow and continuous freshwater inflow into the North Atlantic reduces the GNAIW\n\nformation with a significant freshening of the upper 1000 m accompanied by a drop\n\nin the total ocean heat transport (e.g., Figure 5.2(a)). In Stanford et al. (2011), they\n\n\n\n36\n\ninfer, from proxy data, a slowdown of northern sourced water formation from 19 to\n\n17.5 ka. The H1 meltwater discharge is interrupted at 14.67 ka when the North At-\n\nlantic circulation recovers (Figure 6.1(c)). The deep ocean (below 500m) is fresher.\n\nThe H1 changes in ocean circulation have been associated with atmospheric CO2\n\nchanges (Menviel et al., 2014). It is suggested that an enhanced AABW could have\n\nbeen responsible for 30% of the atmospheric CO2 increase. Between 14.35 and 13.85\n\nka (Figure 6.1(d)), the freshwater source in the Southern Ocean is activated (and re-\n\nactivated in the Northern Hemisphere) in the model. A freshening of most of the upper\n\n1000 m in both the North and South Atlantic can be observed. Even though this event\n\nis of much shorter duration in the model, its magnitude is about 4 times greater in the\n\nSouthern Ocean (maximum of 60 m/kyr) than the meltwater flux in the North Atlantic\n\nat H1 (maximum of 15 m/kyr). The AABW is suppressed and only recovers at the YD\n\n(Figure 6.1(e)), when the North Atlantic receives a new iceberg discharge that slows\n\ndown the AMOC. The opening of the Bering Strait at 12.9 ka in TraCE-21K contributes\n\nto a further weakening of the AMOC through meltwater transport from the Pacific to\n\nthe Nordic seas (He, 2011). As soon as the freshwater flux from the North Atlantic\n\nis interrupted around 11.7 ka, the heat transport towards the north is re-established.\n\nThe salinity barrier, which was responsible for the high stratification in the simulation\n\ninitial condition, was continuously eroded and the dense water that was confined to\n\nthe surface and intermediate layers (GNAIW) can finally sink and become NADW.\n\nDuring the Holocene (Figure 6.1(f)), the features of the modern NADW are in place\n\nand the model results compare well (albeit with very different spatial resolution) with\n\nobserved data from the WOCE (Figure 4.3).\n\nExamining the differences in the vertical salinity profile between H1 and LGM,\n\nBA and H1, MPW-1A and BA, YD and MWP-1A and Holocene and YD (Figure 6.2)\n\nhelps in understanding the changes in the ocean structure between the different pe-\n\nriods. The Atlantic basin is considerably fresher at H1 when compared to the LGM\n\n(Figure 6.2(a)). The largest differences are in the North Atlantic in the upper 1000 m\n\nwith maximum values in the upper 200 m.

Figure from Marson et\n\nal. (2014).\n\n\n\n38\n\n800\u2013900 m is saltier in H1 compared to LGM. This is because the prolonged freshen-\n\ning was entirely in the North Atlantic with the residual LGM saltiness remaining in the\n\nsouthern subtropics\u2019 upper ?800\u2013900 m. Figure 6.2(b) shows the salinity differences\n\nbetween H1 and BA when the GNAIW recovers, which is seen by the positive salinity\n\ndifference in most of the North Atlantic in the upper 1000 m, reaching the equator in\n\nthe surface layers. The impact of MWP-1A with respect to BA is observed in Figure\n\n6.2(c) with a basin-wide freshening. Comparing the salinity differences between the\n\nYD event with MWP-1A (Figure 6.2(d)) shows a similar distribution to Figure 6.2(a),\n\nexcept that the deeper ocean is significantly fresher. The upper 500 m displays a\n\nsaltier South Atlantic and a fresh North Atlantic, indicating a weaker North Atlantic\n\ndense water formation. This structure finally evolves into the opposite structure, with\n\nthe newly formed NADW that is able to spread into the Southern Hemisphere as seen\n\ntoday.\n\nFigure 6.3: TraCE-21K temperature meridional sections across the Atlantic Ocean (25?W) at\n(a) LGM (22 ka\u201319 ka); (b) H1 (19 ka\u201314.67 ka); (c) BA (14.67 ka\u201314.35 ka); (d) MWP-1A\n\n(14.35 ka\u201313.85 ka); (e) YD (12.9 ka\u201311.3 ka); (f) Holocene (11.3 ka\u20130 ka)\n\nThe changes in temperature across the Atlantic are not so visible as the salin-\n\nity changes when we look at Figure 6.3. What we can see is that the temperatures\n\nbecame higher \u2014 especially between 500 and 3000 m \u2014 as time evolved. When\n\nwe observe the temperature differences between the main climatic periods (Figure\n\n\n\n39\n\nFigure 6.4: TraCE-21K temperature differences between (a) H1 (19 ka\u201314.67 ka) and LGM\n(22 ka\u201319 ka); (b) BA (14.67 ka\u201314.35 ka) and H1 (19 ka\u201314.67 ka); (c) MWP-1A (14.35\nka\u201313.85 ka) and BA (14.67 ka\u201314.35 ka); (d) YD (12.9 ka\u201311.3 ka) and MWP-1A (14.35\n\nka\u201313.85 ka); (e) Holocene (11.3 ka\u20130 ka) and YD (12.9 ka\u201311.3 ka).\n\n6.4), however, the changes are clearer. During the H1 (Figure 6.4(a)), the first hun-\n\ndred meters cool down in the NH due to the discharge of cold meltwater. Below\n\nthat, the temperature increase since the freshwater layer isolates the ocean from the\n\natmosphere, trapping the heat in the ocean. The South Atlantic also warms up, re-\n\nflecting the continuous warming in the SH during this period. From the H1 to the BA\n\n(Figure 6.4(b)), there is a general temperature rise trend, except for the tropics\u2019 first\n\nfive hundred meters. The warming is more accentuated in the upper layers of NH,\n\npossibly in response to the abrupt BA warming observed in the North Atlantic. It is\n\npossible to distinguish this warmer water flowing southward around 1500 m, indicating\n\nGNAIW/NADW warming. The temperature response to the MWP-1A is quite different\n\n(Figure 6.4(c)). The large meltwater pulse in both hemispheres cause the intermedi-\n\nate layers to cool down. Additionally, the AABW\u2019s temperature rise because the heat\n\nthat was supposed to scape to atmosphere in southern high latitudes is trapped by\n\nthe stable freshwater layer around Antarctica. When this freshwater layer dissipates,\n\nthe AABW cools down again and the intermediate layers\u2019 temperature increases (Fig-\n\nure 6.4(d)). Also, due to new meltwater discharges during the YD, some cooling is\n\nobserved in the North Atlantic in Figure 6.4(d). The changes in temperature after YD\n\n\n\n40\n\n(Figure 6.4(e)) are very similar to the ones observed after the H1 (Figure 6.4(b)). This\n\nresemblance shows the ocean consistent response to D-O cycles since both H1 and\n\nYD were cold periods followed by rapid warming events. Nevertheless, the warming\n\nin NADW\u2019s tongue is stronger during the Holocene.\n\nIn order to see salinity and temperature changes together, these fields are\n\nplotted in a ? ? S diagram shown in Figure 6.5. The points are an average between\n\n30?S and 0?from the LGM (blue points) to 0 ka (red points). The choice of this par-\n\nticular latitude range (30?S - 0?) is based on the fact that the NADW only assumes\n\nan unified thermohaline characteristic in the South Atlantic, while in the North Atlantic\n\nthis water mass is still divided in its precursors. It can be observed that there is a\n\nshift of the curve towards lower salinities throughout the entire water column, which\n\nis expected given all the freshwater entering the Atlantic Ocean in the last 21 000 yr.\n\nThe changes in the shape of the ? ?S curve for the different periods are significant:\n\nthe ? ? S curve at 21 ka has only two deep water types, while the modern curve (0\n\nka) presents the three main Atlantic Ocean deep water masses (AAIW, NADW and\n\nAABW, as in Figure 6.5(a)). The water type that specifies the NADW characteristics\n\n(salinity maximum at ?2500 m) does not appear until the early Holocene. The ? ?S\n\nplots considering the same latitudinal interval for the South Atlantic, averaged for 21\n\nka, 15 ka, 14.1 ka, 13 ka and 0 ka, are shown in Figure 6.5(b). It is, again, clear that\n\nthe deep salinity maximum characteristic of the NADW within the South Atlantic starts\n\nto develop only after 14.1 ka (Figure 6.5(b), pink curve).\n\nThe absence of the NADW during the glacial period is consistent with proxy\n\nrecords (Adkins et al., 2002). Also, the weaker dense water production in the NH\n\nduring YD is discussed by several studies based on proxy data (Boyle and Keigwin,\n\n1987; Hughen et al., 1998; Praetorius et al., 2008; Roberts et al., 2010). Through\n\n231Pa/230Th ratio analysis, Negre et al. (2010) \u2013 as well as the modeling study of\n\nWainer et al. (2012) \u2013 argue that the modern Atlantic circulation was only fully estab-\n\nlished during the Holocene, which is also consistent with the evolution of the salinity-\n\nbased water mass structure presented in Figure 6.1. The establishment of the NADW\n\n\n\n41\n\nas the main southward component of the AMOC induced the change in the over-\n\nturning circulation geometry. The AMOC became deeper, meridional heat transport\n\nbecame more stable and the NADW became the main salt exporter across the At-\n\nlantic Ocean. Hence, the steep triangle cluster on Figure 5.3 (page 34) is explained:\n\na smaller variability of the heat transport northwards and larger salt transport south-\n\nwards in the Holocene.\n\nFigure 6.5: TraCE-21K ? ?S diagram averaged between 30?S to 0?, at 25?W.

The first step is to plot potential temperature (y-\n\naxis) against salinity (x-axis) - the ??S diagram. Let us start with a simplified example\n\nillustrated in Figure 7.1. Consider two water types A and B, with potential tempera-\n\ntures ?A and ?B and salinities SA and SB, respectively, represented by the blue circles\n\nin Figure 7.1. The dashed line between the two points represents the linear mixing\n\nbetween A and B, i.e., any parcel of water with thermohaline properties that falls within\n\nthe line is the result of a mixing between A and B. The closer the water parcel is to\n\nA, the more A contributes to the formation of the water parcel - and similarly for water\n\ntype B. As an example, the red cross in Figure 7.1 stands for a water parcel formed\n\n\n\n7.1. THE MIXING TRIANGLE TECHNIQUE 43\n\nby the mixing of 20% of A and 80% of B.\n\nFigure 7.1: Mixing between two hypothetical water masses A and B.\n\nMathematically, we can find how much of each water type contributes to the\n\nproperties of the water parcel through the equation set (7.1).\n\n????????\n???????\n? = mA?A + mB?B\n\nS = mASA + mBSB\n\n1 = mA + mB\n\n(7.1)\n\nwhere\n\n? = potential temperature of the water parcel\n\nS = salinity of the water parcel\n\nmA = fraction of the water type A contributing to the mixing\n\nmB = fraction of the water type B contributing to the mixing\n\n0 &lt;(mA , mB) &lt;1\n\nNow, if we include one more water type (C, with potential temperature ?C and\n\nsalinity SC) in our ? ? S diagram, we will have a mixing triangle instead of a mixing\n\n\n\n7.1. THE MIXING TRIANGLE TECHNIQUE 44\n\nline. In the illustrated example (Figure 7.2), the water parcel whose thermohaline\n\nproperties are indicated by the red cross is formed by 10% of A, 60% of B, and 30%\n\nof C. In order to find each water type percentage, follow the lines parallel to triangle\u2019s\n\nside that opposes the desired vertex.\n\nFigure 7.2: Mixing between three hypothetical water masses A, B, and C.\n\nThe equation system for three water types is:\n\n????????\n???????\n? = mA?A + mB?B + mC?C\n\nS = mASA + mBSB + mCSC\n\n1 = mA + mB + mC\n\n(7.2)\n\nwhere\n\n? = potential temperature of the water parcel\n\nS = salinity of the water parcel\n\nmA = fraction of the water type A contributing to the mixing\n\nmB = fraction of the water type B contributing to the mixing\n\nmC = fraction of the water type C contributing to the mixing\n\n0 &lt;(mA , mB , mC) &lt;1\n\n\n\n7.2. ISSUES AND THEIR SOLUTIONS WITHIN THE MIXING TRIANGLE\nTECHNIQUE 45\n\nTherefore, with the known thermohaline values of each water type given by\n\nthe literature, we can determine how much each of them is present at any point of the\n\nocean (where the potential temperature ? and salinity S are observed) by simply solv-\n\ning the system 7.2 and finding mA, mB, and mC (assuming that the mixing between\n\nthem is linear).\n\n7.2 Issues and their solutions within the mixing trian-\n\ngle technique\n\nNow, consider the ??S diagrams prepared with TraCE-21K data (Figure 7.3). As we\n\ncan see, many of the blue circles that represent water parcels do not fall within the\n\ntriangle. In the classic mixing triangle technique described above, this would mean a\n\nnegative contribution of some water type, which is physically impossible. This issue is\n\naddressed by doing modifications to the system of equations 7.2. The altered form of\n\nthe system is:\n\n????????\n???????\n? = mA?A + mB?B + mC?C + ??\n\nS = mASA + mBSB + mCSC + ?S\n\n1 = mA + mB + mC + ?mass\n\n(7.3)\n\nwhere\n\n? = potential temperature of the water parcel\n\nS = salinity of the water parcel\n\nmA = fraction of the water type A contributing to the mixing\n\nmB = fraction of the water type B contributing to the mixing\n\nmC = fraction of the water type C contributing to the mixing\n\n??, ?S, ?mass = residuals\n\n0 &lt;(mA,mB,mC) &lt;1\n\n\n\n7.2. ISSUES AND THEIR SOLUTIONS WITHIN THE MIXING TRIANGLE\nTECHNIQUE 46\n\nThe system is then solved in a nonnegative least-squares sense, i.e., the set\n\nof mx (x=A,B,C) is found by minimizing E, where\n\nE = ?2? + ?\n2\nS + ?\n\n2\nmass (7.4)\n\nwith mx ? 0.\n\nAdditionally, in the \"real\" world a typical ? ? S diagram has more than three\n\nwater types. Consider the TraCE-21K ? ? S diagrams for the Atlantic basin shown\n\nin Figure 7.3. The small circles represent the thermohaline properties of each point\n\ninside the Atlantic basin at a given time \u2014 the light blue ones are parcels located in\n\nthe South Atlantic and the dark blue ones are parcels located in the North Atlantic.\n\nThe red squares stand for the approximate thermohaline indexes of five different water\n\ntypes: Central Waters (CW), Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW), Glacial North At-\n\nlantic Intermediate Water (GNAIW), North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) and Antarctic\n\nBottom Water (AABW). Notice that only four of those appear at each time. With four\n\nwater types it is not possible to construct a single mixing triangle. Thus, we solved this\n\nissue by constructing two triangles adjacent to each other, as indicated by the dashed\n\ngreen lines in Figure 7.3. If we determine in which triangle each point belongs, the\n\nmixing can be calculated normally.\n\nHere, we have to assume that the water types CW and GNAIW (from 21 ka to\n\n14 ka)/AABW (from 12 ka to 0 ka) do not mix because they do not occur in the same\n\ntriangle. The assumption of no-mixing between CW and AABW is safe because they\n\nare separated by layers of intermediate and deep waters. On the other hand, the\n\nmixing between CW and GNAIW can happen in the North Atlantic because they are\n\nin contact. As we will see below, not considering the CW-GNAIW mix results in a\n\nfalse signal of AAIW and AABW dominance in the northern North Atlantic in the first\n\n1500 m, where GNAIW should have larger contributions. We address this problem\n\nby presenting an alternative result for GNAIW distribution. This alternative result was\n\ngenerated using a mixing triangle for the North Atlantic only, which is reasonable\n\nsince most of GNAIW does not cross the equator in TraCE-21K, as we could see\n\n\n\n7.2. ISSUES AND THEIR SOLUTIONS WITHIN THE MIXING TRIANGLE\nTECHNIQUE 47\n\nFigure 7.3: ? ?S diagram for points below 500 m depth for the entire Atlantic Ocean at 21\nka (top left), 14 ka (top right), 12 ka (bottom left) and 0 ka (bottom right). The light (dark) blue\ncircles represent points in the South (North) Atlantic. The red squares mark the endmembers\n\nof the mixing triangle, i.e., the water types: Central Waters (CW), Antarctic Intermediate\nWater (AAIW), Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), Glacial North Atlantic Intermediate Water\n\n(GNAIW), and North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). The dashed green lines define the\nboundaries of the mixing triangles. The inserts in the upper left corners of the upper panels\n\nshow the alternative configuration of the triangle to determine GNAIW\u2019s distribution.\n\nin a previous analysis of the data (Marson et al., 2014). Thus, the triangle vertices\n\nare placed at CW, GNAIW, and AABW water types (see small plots in the upper\n\npanels of Figure 7.3). This way, we allow CW and GNAIW mixing but we cut the\n\ncommunication between the hemispheres. As one can see, the method of mixing\n\ntriangles is simplistic and should be replaced by other methods, such as the Optimum\n\nMultiParameter analysis (OMP, Tomczak and Large, 1989) if a more complex analysis\n\nis required as well as more data (e.g., inorganic nutrients) is available.\n\nAnother issue we faced when working with paleoclimatic data is that the\n\nknown present-day (?,S) pair of each water type does not apply at 21,000 years ago,\n\n\n\n7.2. ISSUES AND THEIR SOLUTIONS WITHIN THE MIXING TRIANGLE\nTECHNIQUE 48\n\nbecause the ocean was significantly different when compared to its modern state. Be-\n\nsides, one cannot fix the thermohaline properties for the whole deglacial run due to\n\nthe large changes the ocean goes through during this interval. Therefore, the (?,S)\n\npair of each water type was calculated every 1,000 years (plotted in Figures 7.4 to\n\n7.7 below), taking into account its general features, formation region, and the approx-\n\nimate vertical distribution of the water masses observed in the Figure 6.1. We could\n\nthus determine:\n\n\u2022 Central Waters (CW), by averaging five points with the highest temperatures\n\nbetween 20-40?N (North Atlantic Central Water, NACW) and 20-40?S (South\n\nAtlantic Central Water, SACW) between 250 and 500 m;\n\n\u2022 Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW), by averaging five points with the lowest\n\nsalinities between 40 and 50?S, 250 to 500 m depth;\n\n\u2022 Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), by averaging five points with the lowest tem-\n\nperatures between 60 and 70?S, 1500 to 5000 m depth; and\n\n\u2022 North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), by averaging the five points with the high-\n\nest salinities and low temperatures (less than 3.5?C), when those salinities\n\nwere greater than the AABW salinity. The region considered was between 40\n\nand 80?N, 1500 to 5000 m depth.\n\nBefore averaging the five points which determine each water type, we re-\n\nmoved points in the ??S diagram that were two standard deviations larger (or smaller)\n\nthan the mean. Since in the mixing triangle analysis we could consider up to four wa-\n\nter masses at the same time, we choose to eliminate SACW and approximate Central\n\nWaters in the entire Atlantic by NACW. The choice seems suitable since our interest\n\nis on denser water masses.\n\nWe saw in the previous chapter that the NADW signal does not appear in the\n\nsimulation until 12 ka. As mentioned above, the literature indicates that in place of\n\nNADW there was Glacial North Atlantic Intermediate Water (GNAIW) at glacial peri-\n\nods. From Figure 7.3 (upper left panel), we observe an additional endmember within\n\n\n\n7.3. RESULTS 49\n\nthe North Atlantic points. Tracing those points to the geographical region where they\n\nbelong, we think this endmember indeed represents GNAIW. Therefore, we deter-\n\nmined GNAIW thermohaline properties by averaging the 5 points with lowest salin-\n\nities which had corresponding lowest temperatures, between 40 and 80?N, 400\n\nto 1500 m depth. As we can see in the ? ? S diagrams (Figure 7.3), GNAIW water\n\ntype is close to AAIW water type, and they become more similar as the deglaciation\n\nprogresses.\n\nIn the next section, we will present the evolution of the water types\u2019 (?,S)\n\nand the fractions m of the water types contribution to each point in the Atlantic. The\n\nfractions m are shown in vertical sections and horizontal maps. We chose four partic-\n\nular periods (21 ka, 14 ka, 12 ka, and 0 ka) to illustrate the range of ocean circulation\n\nchanges seen in the last 21,000 years. In the maps, the white patches indicate ei-\n\nther that there is no data in that region (due to bathymetry or coarse resolution of the\n\ncoasts) or that the error E (given by equation 7.4) exceeded the value we considered\n\nreasonable. This value was calculated considering a residual of 0.001 for salinity\n\n(?S=0.001) and mass (?m=0.001), and a residual of 0.01 for temperature (??=0.01).\n\nFor the presented results, the main area in which the points exceeded this threshold\n\nwas the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n7.3 Results\n\n7.3.1 Evolution of the water types\u2019 properties\n\nThe evolution of the potential temperature of the North Atlantic and South Atlantic\n\nCentral Waters (NACW and SACW, respectively) shows an out-of-phase relation from\n\nthe LGM to 13 ka (Figure 7.4, upper panel). The NACW (dark blue line) cooled from\n\n20 to 17 ka (H1 period), and then warmed until 15 ka, when it reached a peak at the\n\nonset of BA. A new cooling followed until 13 ka, after which the temperatures slowly\n\nrose to Holocene levels. In the South Atlantic, SACW\u2019s temperature began to warm\n\nat 20 ka (light blue line) and showed a short cooling from 16 to 15 ka. After that,\n\n\n\n7.3. RESULTS 50\n\nSACW restarted to warm. From 22 to 17 ka, SACW\u2019s salinity increased (Figure 7.4,\n\nlower panel, orange line) while NACW\u2019s salinity decreased in response to meltwater\n\ninput from H1 (red line). SACW\u2019s salinity had a negative peak around 14 ka, before\n\nreaching Holocene levels at 8 ka. Its northern counterpart has two peaks between\n\nthe LGM and present day \u2014 one in at the onset of the BA and the other is in the early\n\nHolocene. A major drop in NACW\u2019s salinity separate these two peaks at 13 ka.\n\nFigure 7.4: Potential temperature and salinity evolution of Central Waters. The orange and\nlight blue lines represent SACW while the red and dark blue ones represent NACW.\n\nFigure 7.5: Potential temperature and salinity evolution of Antarctic Intermediate Water\n\nThe AAIW\u2019s temperature evolved from ?0.8?C at 22 ka to ?3.2?C at present\n\nday (Figure 7.5, upper panel). The period with higher increase rates coincide with the\n\n\n\n7.3. RESULTS 51\n\nH1. The salinity trend is opposite to the temperature, decreasing from ?35.1 to ?34.5\n\nthroughout the simulation (Figure 7.5, lower panel). Embedded in this monotonic\n\nfreshening, there is a negative peak at 14 ka, associated with MWP-1A.\n\nAlthough the changes in AABW\u2019s thermohaline properties are relatively smooth\n\ndue the stable conditions in the abyssal ocean, the curves in Figure 7.6 show a large\n\ndifference between the glacial AABW and the modern one. AABW\u2019s temperature\n\nstarts at ?-2.5?C and ends up at ?-1.4?C. The warming is almost monotonic except\n\nfor a peak coincident with the meltwater pulse 1A (MWP-1A), around 14 ka. The salin-\n\nity decreases gradually from ?37.3 to ?35.2 during the simulation run. AABW\u2019s core\n\nremains near the bottom throughout the run.\n\nFigure 7.7 shows the evolution of the properties of NADW and its precursor\n\nGNAIW. GNAIW\u2019s temperature at the beginning of the run was nearly as cold as\n\nmodern AABW. The temperature increases from 19 to 14 ka, when it gives its place\n\nto NADW. NADW\u2019s temperature increased between 12 and 11 ka and then remains\n\napproximately constant (around 3?C) until 0 ka. GNAIW\u2019s salinity at the LGM (?35.9)\n\nis similar to NADW\u2019s after 8 ka. After 20 ka, the GNAIW freshens about one unit until\n\n14 ka, except for a slight peak at 15 ka. At 12 ka, NADW\u2019s salinity is very close to\n\nAABW\u2019s salinity, and this probably is the reason why it is difficult to tell them apart\n\nin a salinity vertical section before 11 ka (as we saw in the previous chapter). The\n\ncore depths of both water types are quite distinct: around 500 m for GNAIW and 2500\n\nm for NADW. The GNAIW/NADW points at 13 ka are absent in Figure 7.7 because\n\nthe method could not find either water type. Even if there is some water mass being\n\nformed in the North Atlantic at this time, its properties possibly coincide with a linear\n\ncombination of the other water types and, therefore, cannot be separated.\n\nWe can see on the ??S diagrams (Figure 7.3) that the thermohaline indexes\n\n(i.e., temperature and salinity) found for each water type represent well the mixing\n\ntriangles endmembers. NADW\u2019s and AABW\u2019s salinities at the present time (0 ka),\n\nhowever, are overestimated by the model when compared to observations (Talley\n\net al., 2011).\n\n\n\n7.3.

RESULTS 53\n\n7.3.2 Spatial contribution of analyzed water masses in the At-\n\nlantic Ocean\n\nFigure 7.8 shows the contribution of CW to the water column along the Atlantic (on\n\n25?W) calculated through the mixing triangle method described above. During all the\n\nsimulation, contributions of this water mass are restrict to less than 1000 m of depth.\n\nIf we examine the horizontal structure of the CW distribution (Figure 7.9), we can see\n\nthat the Central Waters concentrate in the middle of the subtropical gyres, especially\n\nthe northern one - since we used NACW water type to represent Central Waters in\n\ngeneral. The CW contribution is largest (?60%) at around 600 m and diminishes as\n\nwe go down on the water column. The patterns of spatial distribution do not change\n\nmuch through the simulation.\n\nThe transect along 25?W for AAIW is presented in Figure 7.10. The highest\n\ncontributions are seen around 40?S, although some signal appears around 40 to 60\n\n?N at 21 and 14 ka. The spatial patterns of AAIW distribution show a decreasing\n\ncontribution north of 40?S. The band of higher percentages around ?40?S is weaker\n\nat H1 (Figure 7.12) and YD (Figure 7.11). The north latitude signal discussed before\n\nis present in the maps around the subpolar gyre and Nordic Seas. This is probably the\n\nundesired result of the GNAIW-CW no-mixing assumption mentioned before. AAIW\n\npercentages are reduced as we go deeper through the water column.\n\nAntarctic Bottom Water contributions are high through most of the Atlantic\n\nOcean from 21 to 14 ka (Figure 7.13, upper panels). The contributions diminish to-\n\nward the surface, except for the southern band from 80?S to 60?S. At 21 ka the per-\n\ncentages are smaller from 40?N to 60?N too, forming a \"blob\" of lower contributions\n\n(as indicated by the arrow in Figure 7.13, upper left panel). A big change is seen from\n\n14 to 12 ka, when AABW contributions drop to nearly zero northward of 40?S and\n\nabove 3000 m. From this point on, the AABW distribution pattern remains generally\n\nthe same.\n\nIn the spatial maps (Figure 7.14, see below), higher percentages of AABW\n\ndominate the latitudes south of ?50?S at ?600 m, and the values increase toward the\n\n\n\n7.3.

From Figure7.14 (upper panels) there is a rise of percentages around and\n\nat the center of the subpolar gyre in the North Atlantic in the upper 1500 m, which\n\nis probably caused by the no-mixing assumption between CW and GNAIW that we\n\nmentioned in section 7.2.

When we consider the mixing between CW and GNAIW in the\n\nalternative triangle (small plots in Figure 7.3), the GNAIW distribution is larger (see\n\n\n\n7.4. DISCUSSION 57\n\nbelow Figure 7.17, left panels) and occupies the intermediate levels as south as 20?N.\n\nBecause GNAIW\u2019s (?,S) are similar to AAIW\u2019s (?,S), the high percentages between\n\nthe equator and 20?N are possibly related to AAIW\u2019s spreading beyond the equator\n\nat the LGM. From 12 ka to the present day, the vertical distribution of NADW does\n\nnot change much and its core dominates depths around 2000 to 3000 m from high\n\nnorthern latitudes to ?40?S (Figure 7.15, lower panels).\n\nThe horizontal distribution of GNAIW shows the highest percentages in the\n\nNordic Seas and lower ones in the subpolar gyre (Figure 7.16, upper left panel and\n\nFigure 7.17, upper right maps). The GNAIW contributions at 14 ka disappear in Figure\n\n7.16 (upper right panel), and are not significant south of 60?N in Figure 7.17. The\n\nNADW shows a very different horizontal distribution, with high concentrations south\n\nof Greenland at ?600 m and throughout the deep ocean down to the Southwestern\n\nAtlantic (Figure 7.16, lower left panel). A quasi-latitudinal band of higher contributions\n\nappears around 40?S at ?600 m. The spatial patterns do not vary significantly from\n\n12 ka to 0ka (Figure 7.16, lower panels), except by a slight decrease in NADW\u2019s\n\ncontribution at the 1500 m layer of the subtropics. This decrease is probably related\n\nto the deepening of NADW\u2019s core after 8 ka, also observed in Figure 7.7 (bottom).\n\n7.4 Discussion\n\nFrom the time series of the CW temperature (Figure 7.4, upper panel), we observe\n\nthat these waters seem to capture the surface temperature signal of each hemi-\n\nsphere (Figure 7.18, top). The out-of-phase pattern between north and south has\n\nbeen known in the literature as the \"bipolar seesaw\" (Broecker, 1998). The North\n\nAtlantic cooled during H1 and YD, while the southern counterpart cooled during BA.\n\nCW salinities also connect with the surface, reflecting the net balance between pre-\n\ncipitation and evaporation (Figure 7.18, middle) and the meltwater fluxes (Figure 7.18,\n\nbottom).\n\nA higher contribution of CW for the subtropical gyres\u2019 center (maps in Figure\n\n\n\n7.4. DISCUSSION 58\n\n?\n\nFigure 7.15: Glacial North Atlantic Intermediate Water at 21 ka (upper left) and 14 ka (upper\nright) and North Atlantic Deep Water at 12 ka (lower left) and 0 ka (lower right) contribution\n(%) below 500 m, along 25?W. The arrow indicates the \"blob\" of GNAIW high contributions\n\ncited in the text.\n\nFigure 7.16: Glacial North Atlantic Intermediate Water at 21 ka (upper left) and 14 ka (upper\nright) and North Atlantic Deep Water at 12 ka (lower left) and 0 ka (lower right) contribution\n\n(%) at various layers.\n\n7.9) agrees with the fact that the Central Waters are formed in those regions and\n\noccupy most of their pycnoclines (Talley et al., 2011).\n\nThe AAIW\u2019s temperature evolves quite monotonically (Figure 7.5, upper panel).\n\n\n\n7.4. DISCUSSION 59\n\nFigure 7.17: Glacial North Atlantic Intermediate Water contribution (%) from the alternative\ntriangle. The left panels show the vertical distribution below 500 m, along 25?W, while the\n\nright panels show the horizontal distribution in the North Atlantic.\n\nFrom 22 to 16ka, the temperature increase in AAIW could be aligned with the early\n\nwarming in the Southern Hemisphere (e.g., Barker et al., 2009). The salinities, in\n\nturn, accompany the overall freshening trend in the Atlantic Ocean, with a sudden\n\ndrop associated with MWP-1A.\n\nThe AAIW also seems to be well represented in its spatial distribution (Figure\n\n7.11). The band of high contribution values coincides with the typical position of\n\nthe Subantarctic Front, which is the region that surface waters are subducted and\n\ntransported northward in intermediate layers (Deacon, 1937). Although this is the\n\nhypothesis of AAIW formation that we consider here, there are other studies that point\n\nto either the southeast Pacific (McCartney, 1977) or Brazil-Malvinas confluence in the\n\nsouthwest Atlantic (Piola and Gordon, 1989). In some cases, the low salinity water\n\nformed in the circumpolar region is called Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW). From\n\nthis band located around 40?S, AAIW spreads northward and gradually mixes with\n\nother water masses. The attributed contribution of AAIW to the northern subpolar gyre\n\nis related do the similarities between its low salinity and fresh GNAIW. This indicates\n\nthat the mixing triangle method cannot distinguish perfectly both water masses in the\n\n\n\n7.4. DISCUSSION 60\n\nFigure 7.18: Mean sea surface temperature (top), precipitation minus evaporation (middle),\nand meltwater fluxes (bottom) for the North (dark blue, red, purple) and South (light blue,\n\norange, violet) Atlantic Ocean from TraCE-21K simulation.\n\nNorthern Hemisphere.\n\nThe lower contributions of AAIW during the H1 (Figure 7.12) and YD (Fig-\n\nure 7.11) raises the question about the northward expansion of AAIW during the last\n\ndeglaciation. The subject is still controversial. There are some studies which suggest\n\nthere was an increase in the northward penetration of AAIW during the cold events\n\n(e.g., Pahnke et al., 2008; Thornalley et al., 2011), resulting in its presence up to\n\n60?N. However, other investigators believe the opposite: AAIW would have been ac-\n\n\n\n7.4. DISCUSSION 61\n\ntually weaker during those periods (Came et al., 2008; Xie et al., 2012). Our results,\n\ntherefore, seem to agree with the second hypothesis.\n\nDuring the last deglaciation, the freshwater resulting from the melting of ice\n\nsheets \u2014 both from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres \u2014 led to a gradual\n\ndecrease of the Antarctic Bottom Water\u2019s salinity (as we saw in chapter 6; Figure 7.6,\n\nlower panel). The small increase of AABW\u2019s temperature accompanied the general\n\nclimate warming trend, and is similar to its freshening \u2014 fairly gradual \u2014, except for\n\nthe small peak at 14 ka (Figure 7.6, upper panel). This peak results from the presence\n\nof freshwater at the surface during the MWP-1A, which increases the vertical stability\n\nof the water column and, consequently, does not allow the heat brought at depth from\n\nthe north to escape. The same behavior was observed by Richardson et al. (2005) in\n\ntheir model study about responses to a freshwater input in the Southern Ocean.\n\nUsing the methodology presented, we could identify GNAIW water type char-\n\nacteristics up to 14 ka (Figure 7.7). We found that GNAIW was a cold and relatively\n\nfresh water mass (when compared to glacial AABW), as suggested by Boyle and Keig-\n\nwin (1987). These characteristics make GNAIW very similar to AAIW in the (?,S)\n\ndomain, especially as the deglaciation advances in time. Interestingly, after 13 ka,\n\nthe fresh \"tail\" that stands for GNAIW in the North Atlantic ? ? S diagram assumes\n\na position similar to the one that Labrador Sea Water occupies in a modern ? ? S\n\ndiagram.\n\nThe LGM GNAIW\u2019s salinity (Figure 7.7, orange line in the middle panel) is\n\nsimilar to modern NADW (Figure 7.7, red line in the middle panel) and was progres-\n\nsively reduced during the H1. It seems that after 16 ka the GNAIW\u2019s salinity trend was\n\nheading toward NADW\u2019s salinity values, but it was interrupted by a freshening at 14\n\nka. Because the ocean waters that mix with the meltwater released during MWP-1A\n\nshare GNAIW\u2019s characteristics, it is hard to distinguish them around 14 ka. This would\n\nexplain the reduction of GNAIW salinity at 14 ka (Figure 7.7, orange line) and also the\n\npresence of a small amount of a GNAIW-like water mass in the Southern Ocean (Fig-\n\nure 7.15 and 7.16, upper right panel). The temperatures increase gradually from 18 ka\n\n\n\n7.4. DISCUSSION 62\n\nto 10 ka, separating the cold GNAIW at the beginning of the last deglaciation from the\n\nwarm and stable NADW during the Holocene (Figure 7.7). The location of GNAIW\u2019s\n\nand NADW\u2019s core in the water column is clearly distinct (Figure 7.7, bottom), which\n\nled us to support the use of different names for these water masses.\n\nThe vertical sections of AABW\u2019s distribution across the Atlantic (Figure 7.13)\n\nshow the dominance of this water mass at the bottom and deep layers of the entire\n\nbasin from 21 to 14 ka. Indeed, as discussed above, it is well established that a\n\nsalty version of AABW expanded meridionally and vertically at the beginning of the\n\ndeglaciation (e.g., Duplessy et al., 1984; Oppo and Fairbanks, 1987; Curry et al.,\n\n1988; Duplessy et al., 1988; Adkins et al., 2002; Cottet-Puinel et al., 2004; Ferrari\n\net al., 2014). From 12 ka on, however, AABW was drastically reduced and confined to\n\nabyssal depths, dominating the entire water column only nearer its formation region\n\nin the Southern Ocean (Figure 7.13, lower panels).\n\nWe believe that the transition between GNAIW and NADW occurred gradu-\n\nally after Heinrich Stadial 1 (after 14.7 ka). Tessin and Lund (2013) analyzed ?13C\n\nreconstructions from Brazil margin cores and suggested a reorganization of water\n\nmasses during the H1, with reduced influence of the northern sourced water mass.\n\nThe freshwater input between 19 and 15 ka might have weakened the intermediate\n\nwater formation in the North Atlantic, which is why the AMOC is sluggish during this\n\nperiod (as mentioned in section 5.1). This meltwater was then transported to the\n\nSouthern Ocean, where it continuously freshened AABW and finally allowed NADW\n\nto sink from 12 ka and beyond (chapter 6 and Figure 7.15, lower panels). This is the\n\npoint when AABW retracts to give space to the newly formed NADW.\n\nThe AABW\u2019s horizontal distribution (Figure 7.14) shows the formation of this\n\nwater mass to be south of 50?S. The spreading of this water mass happens mostly\n\nnear the bottom. At 21 ka and 14 ka (Figure 7.14, upper panels), the AABW\u2019s con-\n\ntribution is considerable also in the deep layers. The higher values at the northern\n\nsubpolar gyre are due to the configuration of the triangles explained above. At 12\n\nka (Figure 7.14, lower left panel) we note the sudden reduction of AABW in the At-\n\n\n\n7.4. DISCUSSION 63\n\nlantic Ocean. AABW spreads at the greatest depths and is probably traceable up\n\nto the subtropical North Atlantic, which is consistent with the pattern observed today\n\n(Purkey and Johnson, 2010; Talley et al., 2011).\n\nWhen we compare the maps showing the GNAIW and NADW horizontal dis-\n\ntributions (Figure 7.16 and 7.17), we notice that the spreading of NADW is much\n\nlarger. NADW is transported by the DWBC and reaches 40?S, where it upwells (see\n\nthe horizontal strip of higher values at ?600 m in the lower two panels of Figure 7.16).\n\nGNAIW, on the other hand, is mostly constrained to the subpolar gyre. The maps also\n\nreveal something else of interest. It appears that GNAIW was formed mainly by the\n\nNordic Seas overflow, and then spreads to the subpolar North Atlantic (Figure 7.16,\n\nupper left panel). NADW, in turn, is a result of the mixing between Nordic Seas over-\n\nflow and Labrador Sea waters (LSW). Proxy data reconstructions indeed suggested\n\nthat LSW formation was absent until the early Holocene and that the main source of\n\ndense waters in the North Atlantic was the Nordic Seas (Hillaire-Marcel et al., 2001;\n\nCottet-Puinel et al., 2004; Crocket et al., 2011). The reason for LSW\u2019s early absence\n\nis likely because of the almost constant meltwater flux from the Laurentide ice sheet\n\ninto the Labrador Sea (Cottet-Puinel et al., 2004).\n\n\n\n64\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\nThe Southern Ocean and the Meltwater\n\nPulse 1A\n\nT\nHE Southern Ocean is the only ocean that covers every longitude, allowing a\n\ncontinuous and strong eastward flow \u2014 the Antarctic Circumpolar Current\n\n(ACC). Because it connects all the major ocean basins, ACC is the main\n\nvehicle that transports water from one ocean to another. Near the Antarctic coast, an-\n\nother current flows opposite to ACC: the Antarctic Coastal Current (ACoC). ACoC is\n\nimportant because it sets the regime where the ocean interacts with ice shelves, which\n\nultimately modify water masses formed on the Antarctic shelf. Due to low tempera-\n\ntures and constant sea ice formation \u2014 which releases salt to the water underneath\n\n\u2014, the shelf waters get very dense and sink to the bottom, especially at the Weddell\n\nand Ross Seas. These very dense waters are later exported to all ocean basins as\n\nAntarctic Bottom Water (AABW), which drives the lower limb of the global Overturning\n\nCirculation.\n\n\n\n8.1. REGIONAL EVOLUTION OF THERMOHALINE PROPERTIES: WEDDELL\nAND ROSS SEAS 65\n\n8.1 Regional evolution of thermohaline properties: Wed-\n\ndell and Ross Seas\n\nThe AABW precursors are mainly formed in the Weddell Sea and Ross Sea (Orsi\n\net al., 2002). Because of that, we have placed a meridional section in each sea\n\nin order to observe the changes in temperature and salinity during the 22 thousand\n\nyears of simulation (Figure 8.1).\n\nFigure 8.1: Chosen transects at the Weddell Sea and Ross Sea (black lines). The position of\nthese transects were determined based on the approximated longitude of the two main point\n\nof dense water formation (Orsi et al., 2002).\n\nThe temperature sections for both seas (Figures 8.2 and 8.3) show a pro-\n\ngressive warming of intermediate and deep waters, especially during the Holocene.\n\nThe range of depths that shows the largest warming is commonly occupied by the\n\nCircumpolar Deep Water (CDW) \u2014 or Warm Deep Water (WDW) in the Weddell Sea.\n\nAs this water mass is essentially formed by deep waters coming from north (North\n\nAtlantic Deep Water, Pacific Deep Water, and Indian Deep Water; Talley et al., 2011),\n\nthe warming of CDW may indicate warming of its predecessors.

THE IMPACT OF THE MWP-1A ON THE SOUTHERN OCEAN DYNAMICS 70\n\n8.2 The impact of the MWP-1A on the Southern Ocean\n\ndynamics\n\nFigure 8.6 shows the evolution of surface ocean current speed, surface salinity, and\n\nwind stress averaged along 55?S and 65?S during the simulation. The 55?S band is\n\non the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) pathway, while the 65?S band is on the\n\nAntarctic Coastal Current (ACoC) pathway.\n\nA general negative trend can be noted in the three variables at 55?S. Although\n\nthere is still controversy about the position and strength of westerlies during and after\n\nthe LGM (Kohfeld et al., 2013), there are studies that point out to stronger winds\n\nat the LGM in high southern latitudes (e.g. Wainer et al., 2005), as we see in the\n\ntop panel of Figure 8.6. The salinity at 55?S decreases according to the prescribed\n\nfreshwater fluxes, with a major drop possibly associated with the northward transport\n\nof the meltwater from the Antarctic ice sheet during the Meltwater Pulse 1A (MWP-\n\n1A). The current speed, as the salinity, has a major drop around 14 ka, but the speed\n\nnegative peak happens before the salinity one.\n\nAt 65?S, the wind stress increases from the LGM to around 12 ka, and then\n\nmaintains a relative stable level on the remaining simulation. This variability is quite\n\ndifferent from salinity and current speed time series. The salinity slightly decreases\n\nover time while the current speed is almost constant, and both of them have a large\n\npeak around 14 ka \u2014 positive for current speed and negative for salinity.\n\nAlthough the general negative trend in the ACC velocity might be essentially\n\na response to the wind stress weakening, it seems that the current speed variability is\n\nassociated with the changes in surface salinity. The wind stress is thought to be the\n\nmain driver of the ACC (e.g. Gill, 1968; Allison et al., 2010), but Hogg (2010) points\n\nout the importance of surface buoyancy controlling ACC intensity. Here, we think\n\nthat the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet played an important role in the Southern\n\nOcean dynamics. Normally, in a meridional section across the Southern Ocean, the\n\nisopycnals rise polewards since the surface waters near the Antarctic shelf are much\n\n\n\n8.2. THE IMPACT OF THE MWP-1A ON THE SOUTHERN OCEAN DYNAMICS 71\n\ndenser compared to surface waters farther north. The sea level, on the other hand,\n\nis higher equatorward. This scenario produces a pressure gradient force from mid- to\n\nhigh-latitudes, which forces the water to flow poleward (Figure 8.7(a)). This flow is ulti-\n\nmately deflected to the left due to Earth\u2019s rotation, reinforcing the ACC \u2014 which flows\n\neastward \u2014 and weakening the ACoC \u2014 which flows westward (Figure 8.7(a)). When\n\nfreshwater is released around Antarctica, the isopycnals deepen and the surface level\n\nrises near the coast. This weakens or inverts the pressure gradient force, resulting\n\nin a flow that is opposite to ACC\u2019s direction (Figure 8.7(b)). In this case, the ACoC\n\nis intensified. This scenario would explain the well-correlated peaks around the time\n\nof the MWP-1A, where an abrupt reduction of salinity is immediately accompanied by\n\nan intensified ACoC (Figure 8.6, bottom). The lag between the minimum salinity and\n\nACC\u2019s speed drop (Figure 8.6, top) might be explained depending on the adjustment\n\ntime of the northward flow of freshwater relative to the pressure gradient generated\n\nby the presence of freshwater over the shelf.\n\nFigure 8.6: Current speed at the ocean surface (blue line), salinity (red line) and wind stress\n(green line) at 55?S (top) and 65?S (bottom).\n\n\n\n8.2.

The only direct communica-\n\ntion between the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean occurs between the tip of Africa and\n\nAntarctica. Since there is no direct water exchange between the Indian and the North\n\nAtlantic, this ocean is a good laboratory where we can isolate and analyze the effects\n\nof a meltwater pulse coming from the Southern Ocean.\n\n\n\n9.1. THE INDIAN OCEAN\u2019S CHARACTERISTICS 74\n\n9.1 The Indian Ocean\u2019s characteristics\n\nIn the Indian Ocean, the surface circulation can be divided into two systems: a sub-\n\ntropical gyre in the southern hemisphere and a seasonal regime in the tropics and\n\nin the Northern Hemisphere, driven by the monsoonal regime. These two systems\n\nare limited at around 10-12?S by the nearly zonal Southern Equatorial Current (Talley\n\net al., 2011). In the boreal summer, strong southwestern winds dominate the Arabian\n\nSea area. These winds reverse northeastward during the winter (Figure 9.1). The\n\nchange in the wind regime affects the ocean currents in this area. During the sum-\n\nmer, the West and East Indian Coastal Current (WICC and EICC) flow eastward, as\n\nwell as the Southwest Monsoon Current, which is present only at this season. During\n\nthe winter, the WICC, the EICC, and the Northeast Monsoon Current flow westward\n\n(Figure 9.2, Talley et al., 2011).\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 9.1: Present climatological winds over the Indian Ocean for (a) July and (b) January\nfrom NCEP reanalysis1.\n\nThe North Indian Ocean has also a salinity contrast between west and east\n\nof India. The Arabian Sea is dominated by the high salinity outflows from the Persian\n\nGulf and Red Sea. The Bay of Bengal, on the other hand, is under the influence of\n\nmajor river discharges, which gives this part of the ocean its low salinity characteristic.\n\nAt intermediate depths, we also find a salinity contrast in the north-south axis of the\n\nwestern Indian Ocean (Figure 9.3). Coming from south, there is a low salinity tongue\n1Data obtained at: http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/histdata/\n\n\n\n9.1.

IMPACTS OF MELTWATER PULSES ON THE INDIAN OCEAN 76\n\nthat indicates the presence of Antarctic Intermediate Water. From north, a salty water\n\nmass originated in the Red Sea extends southward (the Red Sea Water, RSW, with\n\ninfluences of the Persian Gulf waters). Generally, the limit between these two water\n\nmasses is around 5?S (You, 1998). At larger depths, AABW dominates.\n\n9.2 Impacts of meltwater pulses on the Indian Ocean\n\nIn order to compare the state of the Indian Ocean during the last deglaciation with the\n\nmodern state described above, we chose to observe the western Indian in a merid-\n\nional transect at 53?E. Figure 9.4 shows the salinity distribution in this transect at\n\ndifferent times. At the LGM (Figure 9.4(a)), the vertical stratification is reinforced by\n\nthe presence of the salty version of the AABW (Adkins et al., 2002). The stratification\n\ngradually weakens as the simulation advances in time (as we saw previously in the\n\nAtlantic Ocean). At 14 ka (Figure 9.4(c)), the AAIW is much fresher and occupies a\n\nlarger domain than before, while RSW is retracted. After that, the AAIW tongue weak-\n\nens but the RSW plume does not return to its glacial extension. The freshening of the\n\nAAIW at 14 ka is probably associated to the MWP-1A, since part of this water mass\n\nis formed through the subduction of southern surface waters at the Subantarctic Front\n\n(e.g. Sloyan and Rintoul, 2001).\n\nAnalyzing the region where AAIW and RSW meet (between 10?S and the\n\nequator), it is possible to observe when one water mass overcome the other through\n\nthe mean salinity variation in intermediate depths (Figure 9.5(a)). In general, the\n\nsalinity between 200 and 1000 m increases about 0.25 during the H1, after which\n\nthe values drop drastically until 14 ka, during the MWP-1A. At the YD, the salinity in-\n\ncreases by 0.25 again and drops slightly toward Holocene levels. The surface mean\n\nsalinity follow the intermediate layer variability, but has lower salinity values. From\n\n1000 m to the bottom, region of AABW\u2019s dominion, the salinity reduction is approxi-\n\nmately monotonous during the deglaciation.\n\nThe potential temperature for the same layers is presented in Figure 9.5(b).\n\n\n\n9.2.

IMPACTS OF MELTWATER PULSES ON THE INDIAN OCEAN 79\n\nface. Kiefer et al. (2006) show that the temperature variations in the western tropical\n\nIndian, reconstructed from ?18O and Mg/Ca records, remarkably resemble the tem-\n\nperature recorded in Antarctic ice cores. The authors point the Subantarctic Mode\n\nWater (SAMW) \u2014 which can be considered part of the AAIW \u2014 as the responsible\n\nfor the link between these two regions. The SAMW is formed between the Subantarc-\n\ntic and Subtropical Fronts, when it is subducted to depths around 200-600 m and\n\nmoves equatorward, where it upwells at the thermocline base. This way, the signal\n\nis clearer at intermediate depths, as observed in Figure 9.5(b). Kiefer et al. (2006)\n\nhypothesis was later reinforced by Naidu and Govil (2010) and Romahn et al. (2013).\n\nThe surface temperatures seem to mix the patterns observed in Antarctic and\n\nGreenland ice cores, which indicates that the western Indian Ocean responds to the\n\nclimatic variability of both hemispheres.\n\nThe ??S diagram for the same region (53?E, between 10?S and the equator)\n\nis presented in Figure 9.6. It can be seen that the curve has a salinity maximum at\n\nintermediate temperatures. This maximum is associated with the dominance of RSW\n\nover AAIW between 10?S and the equator. According to You (1998), the boundary\n\nbetween RSW and AAIW is usually placed around 5?S, as we mentioned before. As\n\nindicated in the ? ?S diagram, the salinity maximum is larger at 15 ka, while at 14.1\n\nka it reverses to a salinity minimum. The observed change may be associated with\n\nthe northward expansion of the AAIW during the BA period.\n\nIn order to explain this variability in the northern limit of AAIW, we first investi-\n\ngated the atmospheric forcings. The Figure 9.7 shows the variability of the wind stress\n\nover the equator during the last 22 thousand years. Comparing this time series with\n\nthe one associated to the temperature at Greenland (Figure 2.2) we note the similarity\n\nbetween them. The reduction of southwest winds (weakened summer monsoon) is\n\nassociated with cold periods in the North Atlantic.\n\nIn a study with dinoflagellates related to upwelling at the Somalian coast,\n\nZonneveld et al. (1997) found the following sequence of events associated with the\n\nmonsoon system in the Indian Ocean since the LGM:\n\n\n\n9.2.

We notice that the expansion phase\n\n\n\n9.2. IMPACTS OF MELTWATER PULSES ON THE INDIAN OCEAN 81\n\nof AAIW observed at Figures 9.4 and 9.6 is associated to the period of intense SW\n\nmonsoons at the BA. Strong SW winds implicate in a reduced outflow from the Red\n\nSea equatorward (which is consistent with the surface circulation observed at Figure\n\n9.2), allowing AAIW to reach its northernmost position.\n\nAnother important feature of the tropical Indian Ocean responds to climatic\n\nvariations in the model: the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC). In the Figure 9.8, we\n\nobserve the variability in the core speed of this current along the simulation. The\n\nincrease in the speed core is consistent with the intensification of the SW monsoons.\n\nThe core depth almost does not change, rising slightly during the H1.\n\nFigure 9.8: EUC core speed and depth at 53?E.\n\n\n\n82\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\nGeneral Conclusions and Final\n\nConsiderations\n\nThis study examined, through the analysis of the results of a transient paleoclimate\n\nnumerical simulation with the NCAR-CCSM3 from the 21,000 years ago to present\n\nday, the evolution of the deep Atlantic (and western Indian) Ocean circulation under\n\nmeltwater forcing. We went through a brief review of the climatic events since the LGM\n\n(Chapter 2); analyzed the changes in the Atlantic\u2019s circulation, from the variability of\n\nthe AMOC and its associated heat and salt transports to the changes in the thermo-\n\nhaline structure and water masses distribution (Chapters 4 to 7); assessed the direct\n\nimpacts of the presence of freshwater on the Antarctic shelf (Chapter 8); and investi-\n\ngated the indirect impact of the meltwater discharges in the dynamics of the western\n\nIndian Ocean (Chapter 9). As these last two chapters (8 and 9) were not explored as\n\ndeeply as the ones concerning the Atlantic Ocean, we suggest that TraCE-21K data\n\nfor the Southern Ocean and the Indian Ocean are further investigated in the future.\n\n\n\n83\n\nThe main conclusions we have found are:\n\n1. The glacial ocean (21 ka) was very stable, stratified, and its layers did not mix as\n\nmuch as they do today. The main reason for this vertical configuration was the\n\nproduction of a salty version of AABW, which occupied most of the deep ocean\n\nbasins. The presence of this very dense water mass below 2000 m of depth\n\ndid not allow the intrusion of the northern water mass to the modern NADW\n\nlevel. At 12 ka, AABW\u2019s distribution was drastically reduced by the appearance\n\nof NADW;\n\n2. AABW had a gradual warming and freshening since the LGM, except for the\n\nsmall warming peak during the MWP-1A, associated with reduced upwelling of\n\nnorthern warm waters;\n\n3. As the upper North Atlantic gets flooded by freshwater during the H1 and this\n\nfreshwater reaches the deep ocean through the Southern Ocean, the ocean\u2019s\n\nvertical structure starts changing but the salinity stratification still only allows\n\nthe formation of an intermediate water mass in the North Atlantic, the so-called\n\nGNAIW;\n\n4. GNAIW was a cold water mass, fresher than AABW that existed in the begin-\n\nning of the deglaciation; its characteristics made GNAIW very similar to AAIW;\n\nGNAIW was shallower than NADW and could not spread as much southward;\n\n5. GNAIW\u2019s formation progressively weakened during the Heinrich Stadial 1 \u2014\n\nwhich caused the MOC to slow down \u2014 and was finally replaced by modern\n\nNADW after 12 ka;\n\n6. The impact on the ocean structure resulting from the continuous freshening\n\nallows the erosion of the salinity barrier that was preventing the spread of the\n\nNADW into the South Atlantic. The newly formed NADW is allowed to sink and\n\nspreads southward;\n\n\n\n84\n\n7. Since 12 ka, NADW has been formed by contributions from both Nordic Seas\n\noverflow and the Labrador Sea Water. Prior to this, GNAIW was mainly formed\n\nby Nordic Seas overflow;\n\n8. During the Holocene, the vertical distribution of salinity (related to the distribu-\n\ntion of Atlantic water masses) reaches its modern-day pattern. Therefore, the\n\npresent-day NADW owes its spatial structure to the impact of several freshwa-\n\nter discharges in the Atlantic, which contributed to the erosion of the subsurface\n\nsalinity barrier formed at LGM.\n\n9. AAIW seems to have weakened during the cold events H1 and YD;\n\n10. The presence of freshwater over the Antarctic shelf shortly induced the inten-\n\nsification of the Antarctic Coastal Current and the slowdown of the Antarctic\n\nCircumpolar Current. The connection between the salinity field and the current\n\nspeeds happens through the change in the meridional pressure gradient and its\n\nresulting flow;\n\n11. The western tropical Indian Ocean responds to the climatic variations from both\n\nhemispheres: the Northern Hemisphere through the atmosphere and the South-\n\nern Hemisphere essentially through the ocean. Wang et al. (2013) point the\n\ninfluence of both hemispheres in the Indian Ocean, highlighting that the signal\n\ncaptured by each proxy may differ according to the phytoplankton preference\n\nto the southern winter or summer. According to these authors, the variation of\n\nthe ITCZ position favors the record of the NH temperatures when the same is\n\ndisplaced southward and the record of SH temperatures when it is displaced\n\nnorthward.\n\nIt is worth to notice that we analyzed a single transient run where no con-\n\ntrol simulation or other companion sensitivity experiments were available to access\n\nuncertainties and robustness of the results with respect to each individual meltwater\n\nflux. Furthermore, there are other intrinsic uncertainty sources such as the prescribed\n\nmeltwater flux in TraCE-21 (that is obtained indirectly from sea level records) plus the\n\n\n\n85\n\nfact that the timing, magnitude and location of MWP-1A, associated with global sea\n\nlevel change, has significant uncertainty as well. Since the meltwater fluxes were\n\nprescribed, it does not necessarily mean that the model has the correct sensitivity to\n\nthe freshwater input. In this respect, interpretation of the results has to be taken with\n\ncaution considering that the lack of a control run does not allow us to single out cause\n\nand effect relationships relative to individual events.\n\nMoreover, the method of analysis employed to determine the water masses\n\ndistribution is quite simplistic. Using only two physical properties to identify four water\n\nmasses is somewhat limiting. Nevertheless, the information this analysis produced\n\nis of considerable value, especially because it shows the continuous evolution of the\n\ndeep Atlantic water masses since the LGM. The formation regions indicated by the\n\nhighest percentages of contribution at thermocline levels are consistent with much\n\nof the oceanographic data literature. In addition, the main water mass distribution\n\npatterns formed are quite reasonable. We believe that this work gives new insights\n\ninto the evolution, on the millennial time scale, of the deep Atlantic circulation in the\n\nlast 21,000 years.\n\n\n\n86\n\nAcademic production\n\nPapers presented in scientific events\n\n1.
