A realidade \u00e9 que nosso planeta n\u00e3o \u00e9 apenas uma \u00e1rea geogr\u00e1fica com 510 \n\nmilh\u00f5es de km2. Se todos os planetas possuem uma \u00e1rea geogr\u00e1fica, apenas a Terra possui \n\num sistema intrinsecamente acoplado ao planeta f\u00edsico, capaz de sustentar a vida tal como \n\na conhecemos. Do ponto de vista jur\u00eddico, o planeta possui apenas uma exist\u00eancia como \n\nentidade territorial. Esta vis\u00e3o unidimensional exclui a express\u00e3o mais not\u00e1vel e vital da \n\nnatureza - o funcionamento do Sistema da Terrestre como o \u201csoftware\u201d que suporta a \n\nvida. O Sistema Terrestre \u00e9 um bem uno, global e intang\u00edvel, que n\u00e3o encontra amparo \n\nna rigidez do atual ordenamento jur\u00eddico. O conhecimento cient\u00edfico j\u00e1 identificou os \n\nindicadores que determinam o estado deste Sistema, os chamados \u201cLimites do Planeta\u201d, \n\nque definem as balizas que n\u00e3o devemos transgredir para manter o Sistema da Terrestre \n\ndentro do Espa\u00e7o de Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Segura para a Humanidade. Este espa\u00e7o qualitativo e \n\nquantitativo de seguran\u00e7a \u00e9 intang\u00edvel e n\u00e3o-territorial, e constitui o nosso verdadeiro \n\nGlobal Common existente no interior e al\u00e9m de todas as fronteiras. Do seu n\u00e3o \n\nreconhecimento pelo Direito Internacional, resulta a sua invisibilidade no seio da \n\ncomunidade das na\u00e7\u00f5es e dos povos. A sua inexist\u00eancia jur\u00eddica autoriza, pois, o seu uso \n\ndesregulado e a consequente trag\u00e9dia do nosso bem comum global, reduzido \u00e0 categoria \n\nde \u201cexternalidade\u201d. \n\nJ\u00e1 h\u00e1 muito que as ci\u00eancias jur\u00eddicas reconheceram a exist\u00eancia de bens jur\u00eddicos \n\nintang\u00edveis como solu\u00e7\u00e3o para a prote\u00e7\u00e3o de determinados interesses ou bens que se \n\ntornaram relevantes para as sociedades humanas. O patrim\u00f3nio cultural imaterial da \n\nUNESCO, o direito de autor, ou o valor intang\u00edvel das empresas (onde frequentemente o \n\nvalor dos ativos intang\u00edveis \u00e9 incomparavelmente superior ao valor dos bens tang\u00edveis) \n\ns\u00e3o alguns exemplos.  \n\nA analogia entre estes objetos de direito intang\u00edveis e o Sistema de Terrestre, pode ser \n\ncrucial n\u00e3o s\u00f3 para representar a funcionalidade global e indivis\u00edvel do Sistema Terrestre \n\n\n\n \n\nna comunidade internacional, como para dar visibilidade econ\u00f3mica ao valor real dos \n\nservi\u00e7os intang\u00edveis realizados pelos ecossistemas na manuten\u00e7\u00e3o dos ciclos \n\nbiogeof\u00edsicos, cujo valor \u00e9 incomparavelmente superior ao valor tang\u00edvel dos \n\necossistemas naturais que os produzem.  \n\nUma parte significativa do desafio de \u201cTransformar o Mundo\u201d passa pela possibilidade \n\nde tornarmos o trabalho da biosfera vis\u00edvel na sociedade, nas a\u00e7\u00f5es humanas e nas \n\ntransa\u00e7\u00f5es econ\u00f3micas e financeiras. Atualmente o valor da natureza s\u00f3 se torna vis\u00edvel \n\nnas transa\u00e7\u00f5es financeiras atrav\u00e9s da sua destrui\u00e7\u00e3o e transforma\u00e7\u00e3o em mat\u00e9rias-primas, \n\ncomo ocorre com a madeira das florestas.  \n\nO objetivo \u00e9 propor que o estado favor\u00e1vel do Sistema Terrestre caracter\u00edstico do \n\nPer\u00edodo do Holoceno seja reconhecido Patrim\u00f3nio Comum Intang\u00edvel da Humanidade. O \n\nobjetivo \u00e9 o de promover este novo bem jur\u00eddico global como \"plataforma de \n\ncoordena\u00e7\u00e3o\", onde todas as externalidades positivas e negativas possam ser agregadas e \n\ncontabilizadas. Este novo objeto de governan\u00e7a global coexistir\u00e1 com os regimes legais \n\ndas soberanias estaduais: um Condom\u00ednio Planet\u00e1rio. O condom\u00ednio \u00e9 o \u00fanico modelo \n\njur\u00eddico existente que n\u00e3o se limita a uma divis\u00e3o dos elementos espaciais, mas reconhece \n\nigualmente a exist\u00eancia de elementos n\u00e3o- espaciais funcionais (ex: eletricidade, \u00e1gua) e \n\nque por isso \u00e9 capaz de assegurar uma governa\u00e7\u00e3o multi-level. \n\nSe utilizarmos diferentes de tipos de divis\u00e3o jur\u00eddica (funcional e espacial) \u00e9 poss\u00edvel \n\na coexist\u00eancia pac\u00edfica de dois regimes legais sobrepostos, mas articulados, no interior do \n\nmesmo espa\u00e7o f\u00edsico. Com a devida adapta\u00e7\u00e3o de escala a teoria que resulta desta solu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\npoderia ter profundas implica\u00e7\u00f5es na organiza\u00e7\u00e3o jur\u00eddica das sociedades humanas nos \n\ndois horizontes que partilham - a Casa Comum da Humanidade: por um lado as \n\njurisdi\u00e7\u00f5es dos Estados (elementos territoriais) sobre o qual \u00e9 poss\u00edvel aplicar conven\u00e7\u00f5es \n\njur\u00eddicas de divis\u00e3o, e por outro, de forma acoplada e sobreposta, a salvaguarda do \n\nSistema Terrestre indivis\u00edvel (elementos n\u00e3o-territoriais). \n\nO reconhecimento deste bem intang\u00edvel que nos une a todos numa escala global \u00e9 \n\numa condi\u00e7\u00e3o estrutural para tornar vis\u00edveis os fatores vitais que suportam a vida, e iniciar \n\num processo em que a manuten\u00e7\u00e3o permanente da Casa Comum n\u00e3o constitui um preju\u00edzo \n\npara quem realiza benef\u00edcios comuns. Esta \u00e9 uma oportunidade para transformar as \n\npessoas e na\u00e7\u00f5es em sujeitos de uma humanidade concreta e realizar a transforma\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ncivilizacional da passagem de uma comunidade de exploradores do Sistema Terrestre, \n\npara uma comunidade de curadores e gestores do uso da nossa Casa Comum. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Patrim\u00f3nio Comum da Humanidade, Natureza Intang\u00edvel, Sistema \nTerrestre, Casa Comum da Humanidade, Bens Comuns Globais Intang\u00edveis, Ecologia \nHumana, Direito do Ambiente, Governan\u00e7a Global, Limites do Planeta. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nAbstract \n \n\nScience has shown that what is at stake is not \u201csaving the planet\u201d, but rather ensuring \n\nthe continued favourable state of the Earth System for humanity. That means that a planet \n\nbeyond the favourable state cannot serve as our \u201cCommon Home\u201d. The reality is that our \n\nplanet is not only a geographical area of 510 million km2. All planets have a geographical \n\narea, but only Earth has a living system intrinsically coupled to the physical planet, able \n\nto sustain life just as we know it. From a legal point view, the planet only has an existence \n\nas a territorial entity. This one-dimensional vision excludes the most remarkable and vital \n\nexpression of nature - the functioning of the Earth System as the software which supports \n\nlife. The Earth System is a single, global and intangible asset, which finds no basis in the \n\nrigidity of the current legal framework. Scientific knowledge has already identified the \n\nindicators which determine the state of this System, the so-called \u201cPlanetary Boundaries\u201d, \n\nwhich cannot be exceeded in order to ensure that the Earth System remains within the \n\nfavourable state -  the Safe Operating Space for Humanity. This qualitative and \n\nquantitative safe space is intangible and non-territorial, and constitutes our real Global \n\nCommons, existing within and beyond all borders. Its lack of acknowledgement by \n\nInternational Law results in its invisibility within the community of nations and peoples. \n\nTherefore, its legal non-existence authorises its deregulated use and consequent tragedy \n\nfor our global common asset, reduced to the category of \u201cexternality\u201d. \n\nLegal sciences have long acknowledged the existence of intangible legal assets as a \n\nsolution to protect certain interests or assets which became relevant to human societies. \n\nUNESCO\u2019s intangible cultural heritage, copyrights, or the intangible value of companies \n\n(where the value of intangible assets is often exceptionally higher than that of tangible \n\nassets) are some examples.  \n\nThe analogy between these intangible objects of law and the Earth System may be \n\ncrucial not only to represent the global and indivisible functionality of the Earth System \n\nin the bosom of the international community, but also to lend economic visibility to the \n\nreal value of the intangible services provided by ecosystems and other features of the \n\nEarth System (e.g., atmospheric and oceanic circulation) in maintaining global \n\nbiogeophysical and biogeochemical cycles, whose value is exceptionally higher than the \n\ntangible value of the component systems which produce them.  \n\n\n\n \n\nA significant part of the challenge of \u201cTransforming the World\u201d entails the possibility \n\nof making the work of the Earth System visible in society, human actions, and economic \n\nand financial transactions. Nowadays, the value of nature only becomes visible in \n\nfinancial transactions through its destruction and transformation into raw materials, as \n\nhappens with the timber of forests.  \n\nThe objective is to put forward a proposal so that the favourable state of the Earth \n\nSystem as a whole, which is represented by the current geological epoch, the Holocene, \n\nis recognised as Intangible Common Heritage of Humanity. The objective is to promote \n\nthis new global legal asset as a \u201ccoordination platform\u201d, where all positive and negative \n\nexternalities can be aggregated and accounted for. This new object of global governance \n\nwill coexist with the legal frameworks of state sovereignties: one Planetary \n\nCondominium. The condominium is the only existing legal model which is not limited \n\nto a division of spatial elements, but also recognises the existence of non-spatial \n\nfunctional elements (e.g.: electricity, water), and, for that reason, is able to ensure multi-\n\nlevel governance aimed at maintaining the integrity of the building as an integrated whole. \n\nIf we use different types of legal division (functional and spatial) it is possible to have \n\nthe peaceful coexistence of two overlapping, but coordinated, legal frameworks within \n\nthe same physical space. With the proper scale adjustment, the theory which results from \n\nthis solution could have profound meaning in the legal organisation of human societies \n\nin the two horizons they share - the Common Home of Humanity: on the one hand, State \n\njurisdictions (territorial elements) over which it is possible to apply legal conventions of \n\ndivision, and, on the other hand, coupled and overlapping, the safeguarding of the \n\nindivisible Earth System (non-territorial elements). \n\nThe legal recognition of this intangible asset which unites us all at a global scale is \n\na structural condition to lend visibility to the vital factors which sustain life, and to start \n\na process in which the permanent maintenance of the Common Home will not be an \n\neconomical loss to those who provide common benefits. This is an opportunity to \n\ntransform peoples and nations into subjects of an actual humanity and to achieve \n\ncivilizational transformation, from a community of Earth System exploiters to a \n\ncommunity of Common Home curators and managers. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Common Heritage of Humankind, Intangible Nature, Earth System, \nCommon Home of Humanity, Intangible Global Commons, Human Ecology, \nEnvironmental Law, Global Governance, Planetary Boundaries. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\u00cdndice \n \n\nResumo ...................................................................................................................... 13 \nAbstract ...................................................................................................................... 16 \n\n\u00cdndice .......................................................................................................................... 18 \nPARTE I ................................................................................................................................ 1 \n\n1.

Motiva\u00e7\u00e3o e Justifica\u00e7\u00e3o para o Tema \n\n \n \n\nPodemos afirmar que o per\u00edodo de estudos desta tese prolongou-se de forma continua \n\ndesde 2006. No entanto o motivo seminal deste projeto de constru\u00e7\u00e3o de uma arquitetura \n\njur\u00eddica mais adequada ao funcionamento global do Sistema Terrestre teve origem ainda \n\nanteriormente. Em Novembro de 2002 o acidente do petroleiro Prestige na costa galega \n\nperto da fronteira portuguesa causou uma enorme mar\u00e9 negra, que se espalhou desde o \n\nnorte de Portugal at\u00e9 Vend\u00e9e em Fran\u00e7a. At\u00e9 aqui, nada de realmente novo ou diferente \n\nrelativamente a outras mar\u00e9s negras que infelizmente ocorreram j\u00e1 um pouco por todo \n\nmundo. O momento iniciador da constru\u00e7\u00e3o de um novo conceito,  surge com a primeira \n\nrea\u00e7\u00e3o das autoridades espanholas, quando tentam rebocar o petroleiro para as \u00e1guas \n\nterritoriais portuguesas, como se o petr\u00f3leo passasse apenas a ser um problema portugu\u00eas \n\ne n\u00e3o continuasse a espalhar-se dois lados da fronteira... Analisando os motivos que est\u00e3o \n\nna origem desta disfuncionalidade jur\u00eddica entre a realidade ambiental e as constru\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nsociais, que levam a confundir as representa\u00e7\u00f5es humanas com a pr\u00f3pria realidade, \n\npercebi que a origem prim\u00e1ria desta disfun\u00e7\u00e3o se encontra no direito e que competir\u00e1 em \n\nprimeira linha \u00e0s ci\u00eancia jur\u00eddicas encontrar solu\u00e7\u00f5es de adapta\u00e7\u00e3o entre as formas de \n\norganiza\u00e7\u00e3o social e o funcionamento do planeta que habitamos e que pertencemos.  \n\nTendo participado nas a\u00e7\u00f5es de limpeza que \u00e0 \u00e9poca se realizaram no norte de \n\nPortugal, voltando para casa depois de um longo dia de limpeza e reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o de aves \n\noleadas, ao abrir a caixa do correio encontrei uma conta de milhares de euros para pagar, \n\nao qual estava em anexo um or\u00e7amento relativo aos trabalhos de restaura\u00e7\u00e3o no meu \n\ncondom\u00ednio. \n\n\n\n 2 \n\nPercebi ent\u00e3o que a maioria desse montante era para o restauro de janelas que est\u00e3o no \n\nespa\u00e7o interior do apartamento dos meus vizinhos da frente. Completamente intrigado, \n\ncomecei a estudar a estrutura legal de um condom\u00ednio. Quanto mais eu lia, mais se tornou \n\nevidente que as referidas janelas n\u00e3o pertenciam ao vizinho que possu\u00eda a fra\u00e7\u00e3o onde as \n\njanelas est\u00e3o localizadas, mas eram sim compropriedade de todos os meus vizinhos que \n\nhabitam o condom\u00ednio. Todos n\u00f3s t\u00ednhamos n\u00e3o s\u00f3 uma titularidade comum sobre aquela \n\njanela e v\u00e1rios outros elementos do pr\u00e9dio, bem como a correspondente responsabilidade \n\ncompartilhada pela sua manuten\u00e7\u00e3o, uma vez que a inexist\u00eancia de manuten\u00e7\u00e3o destes \n\nelementos se iria refletir na habitabilidade de todo o pr\u00e9dio. Ao estudar em detalhe a \n\nconstru\u00e7\u00e3o legal que cercava a minha vida di\u00e1ria, percebi que esta estava cheia de \n\nsignificados te\u00f3ricos e possibilidades que questionavam tudo o que me havia sido \n\nensinado na Universidade ... Depois de alguns anos a tentar desvendar a complexidade \n\ndesse modelo, percebi que a solu\u00e7\u00e3o ali presente, porque tinha surgido como resposta a \n\numa necessidade da vida real, nunca tinha sido devidamente dissecada pela doutrina nos \n\nseus m\u00faltiplos significados e dimens\u00f5es. Como tudo o que n\u00e3o tem explica\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 \n\ncomplexo, a doutrina espanhola chamara-lhe mesmo propriedade complexa. Hoje cada \n\nvez tenho mais a certeza de que a liga\u00e7\u00e3o que fiz entre a mancha de petr\u00f3leo que existia \n\nde forma sobreposta com a linha imagin\u00e1ria que separa as \u00e1guas territoriais e janela \n\ncomum no interior da casa do meu vizinho, foi o momento em que se colocava em causa \n\no paradigma de divis\u00e3o de sobre o qual se alicer\u00e7ava a disfun\u00e7\u00e3o entre o Sistema Terrestre \n\ne as sociedades humanas, do qual s\u00e3o parte integrante.  \n\nO processo de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o come\u00e7a ainda durante o ano de 2003, dando origem \u00e0 \n\npublica\u00e7\u00e3o em 2007 do livro, \u201cCondom\u00ednio da Terra \u2013 Das altera\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas a uma \n\nnova conce\u00e7\u00e3o Jur\u00eddica do Planeta\u201d, publicado pela Livraria Almedina, Coimbra. Em \n\n2016 \u00e9 publicado \u201cSOS Treaty \u2013 Save Operating Space Treaty \u2013 A New Approach to \n\nManaging Our Use of the Earth System, pela Cambridge Scholars Publishing, em parceria \n\ncom uma s\u00e9rie de autores nacionais e estrangeiros, onde foram publicados de forma \n\nintegral os cap\u00edtulos 3,4,5 e 7 desta tese. Nesta linha de desenvolvimento do projeto, em \n\nSetembro de 2017 foi submetida uma proposta ao \u201cGlobal Challenges Prize 2017: A New \n\nShape \u2013 Remodelling Global Cooperation, que constitui o Cap\u00edtulo 6 desta Tese. \n\nA linha de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o pluridisciplinar realizada durante estes anos, embora tenha \n\ndado origem a profundas evolu\u00e7\u00f5es na utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o e conjuga\u00e7\u00e3o de instrumentos e \n\nconsequentemente nas solu\u00e7\u00f5es encontradas, n\u00e3o deixou nunca de ter como esqueleto \n\nbase as possibilidades oferecidas pelo modelo do condom\u00ednio, que ao fim deste per\u00edodo \n\n\n\n 3 \n\njulgo come\u00e7ar a ser desvendado na sua complexidade, e tornar-se simples e evidente o \n\nporqu\u00ea da sua potencialidade. \n\n \n\nPercebemos ent\u00e3o que: \n\n \n\n1) Num condom\u00ednio n\u00e3o existe apenas uma divis\u00e3o do espa\u00e7o. Existe igualmente uma \n\ndivis\u00e3o jur\u00eddica funcional relativa \u00e0s fun\u00e7\u00f5es essenciais:  a estrutura de estabilidade, os \n\nsistemas de uso comum (\u00e1gua, luz, elevadores...) e os elementos funcionais (escadas, \n\ntelhado, coberturas), que est\u00e3o sobre o regime de propriedade comum. Quer isto dizer que \n\ntodos elementos que asseguram a habitabilidade e funcionalidade do pr\u00e9dio no seu todo, \n\ne sobre quais n\u00e3o \u00e9 poss\u00edvel nenhuma opera\u00e7\u00e3o jur\u00eddica de divis\u00e3o, nem mesmo abstrata, \n\ns\u00e3o comuns. S\u00f3 posteriormente a esta divis\u00e3o funcional, \u00e9 que se procedeu \u00e0 divis\u00e3o \n\njur\u00eddica abstrata dos espa\u00e7os que ir\u00e3o ser objeto de direitos de propriedade privada. \n\n \n\n2) Esta divis\u00e3o funcional, tornava poss\u00edvel que no interior dos espa\u00e7os sobre o regime de \n\npropriedade privada, existissem elementos e sistemas e que estavam sobre o regime \n\njur\u00eddico de propriedade comum. Isto significa, que se utilizarmos diferentes de tipos de \n\ndivis\u00e3o jur\u00eddica (funcional e espacial) \u00e9 poss\u00edvel assegurar a coexist\u00eancia pac\u00edfica de dois \n\nregimes legais sobrepostos no interior do mesmo espa\u00e7o f\u00edsico. \n\n \n\n3) Se acompanharmos esta dupla divis\u00e3o, por um sistema de contributos diferenciados e \n\nequitativos entre a cada um dos vizinhos, com o objetivo de assegurar a gest\u00e3o \n\npermanente do mesmo pr\u00e9dio materialmente indivis\u00edvel, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel harmonizar, conciliar \n\ne tornar simbioticamente interdependentes os interesses individuais e comuns, \n\ntendencialmente opostos e conflituantes. \n\n \n\n4) Com a devida adapta\u00e7\u00e3o de escalas, a teoria que resulta desta solu\u00e7\u00e3o poderia ter \n\nprofundos significados na organiza\u00e7\u00e3o jur\u00eddica das sociedades humanas \u00e0 escala do \n\nplaneta - a Casa Comum da Humanidade: por um lado o planeta f\u00edsico, geogr\u00e1fico e \n\nterritorial sobre o qual \u00e9 poss\u00edvel realizar abstra\u00e7\u00f5es jur\u00eddicas de divis\u00e3o, e por outro, de \n\nforma acoplada e sobreposta, o Sistema Terrestre, uno e intang\u00edvel, e sobre o qual n\u00e3o \u00e9 \n\nposs\u00edvel realizar nenhuma divis\u00e3o legal nem de forma abstrata. \n\n \n\n\n\n 4 \n\n5) Esta teoria, porque permite uma reconfigura\u00e7\u00e3o das rela\u00e7\u00f5es que se estabelecem em \n\ntorno da posse e uso de um mesmo bem, (em que a propriedade privada pode coexistir \n\ncom a propriedade comum) permite-nos imaginar novas solu\u00e7\u00f5es para harmonizar as \n\ntens\u00f5es entre o modelo econ\u00f3mico que enaltece a divis\u00e3o, a autonomia e a liberdade \n\nindividuais, com a sempre necess\u00e1ria a\u00e7\u00e3o coletiva para assegurar a manuten\u00e7\u00e3o do bem \n\ncomum global \u2013 Um Sistema Terrestre num estado favor\u00e1vel, e sobre o qual n\u00e3o \u00e9 \n\nposs\u00edvel realizar nenhum tipo de divis\u00e3o. Por outras palavras, o condom\u00ednio \u00e9 um modelo \n\nde organiza\u00e7\u00e3o da interdepend\u00eancia, uma vez que s\u00f3 na prossecu\u00e7\u00e3o do interesse comum, \n\n\u00e9 poss\u00edvel assegurar o direito de cada um. \n\nPartindo desta linha de racioc\u00ednio, a matriz metodol\u00f3gica foi marcada por sucessivas \n\netapas de aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o estrat\u00e9gica a v\u00e1rias \u00e1reas do conhecimento, integrando as duas \n\nabordagens ideol\u00f3gicas dominantes, que foram at\u00e9 hoje consideradas opostas e \n\nantag\u00f3nicas no que diz respeito \u00e0 estrat\u00e9gia de gest\u00e3o de bens comuns. Partindo das \n\npossibilidades abertas pelo modelo do condom\u00ednio, este projeto funcionou como uma \n\nplataforma de encontro de muitas solu\u00e7\u00f5es j\u00e1 encontradas. Como afirmam Almeida et.al., \n\n(2010.10) \u201cA fal\u00eancia das macro narrativas ideol\u00f3gicas, que afirmavam a excecionalidade \n\nhumana (Dunlap et al., 2002), desde o capitalismo ao comunismo, confronta-se com a \n\nemerg\u00eancia do discurso ecol\u00f3gico. Este discurso reabilita a urg\u00eancia de uma solidariedade \n\nintergeracional e a \u00edntima liga\u00e7\u00e3o entre a pol\u00edtica e a economia, concorrendo para o \n\nencontro de solu\u00e7\u00f5es e de responsabilidades coletivas. Contudo, se as quest\u00f5es ambientais \n\nglobais suscitam solu\u00e7\u00f5es globais, ou a concretiza\u00e7\u00e3o de um largo espectro de \n\ncompromissos internacionais, a experi\u00eancia humana da exist\u00eancia \u00e9 essencialmente \n\nfenomenol\u00f3gica e associada \u00e0s rotinas da vida quotidiana (Berger et al., 1985)\u201d.  \n\nA descoberta e defini\u00e7\u00e3o Safe Operating Space of Humankind, como espa\u00e7o \n\nbiogeof\u00edsico relativo \u00e0 estrutura de concentra\u00e7\u00f5es biogeoqu\u00edmicas do Sistema Terrestre, \n\ne, portanto, como espa\u00e7o qualitativo n\u00e3o geogr\u00e1fico, possibilita-nos esse salto para o \n\nglobal, essa liga\u00e7\u00e3o entre o local e global, entre economia e politica nas suas dimens\u00f5es \n\nlocais e globais. Requer igualmente uma reorienta\u00e7\u00e3o da perce\u00e7\u00e3o do que foi entendido \n\nat\u00e9 hoje como \u201cCasa Comum da Humanidade\u201d: este espa\u00e7o intang\u00edvel, relativo \u00e0s \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es biogeof\u00edsicas que suportaram o desenvolvimento das sociedades humanas, n\u00e3o \n\nse refere ao planeta f\u00edsico ou ao espa\u00e7o geogr\u00e1fico/pol\u00edtico, constitu\u00eddo pela soma das \n\ndiferentes \u00e1reas sob jurisdi\u00e7\u00e3o dos Estados e das \u00e1reas remanescentes. O conceito de Casa \n\nComum tem subjacente as condi\u00e7\u00f5es de habitabilidade da Casa na sua totalidade, que \n\nexistem em simult\u00e2neo no interior e exterior de todas as soberanias. Neste sentido a Casa \n\n\n\n 5 \n\nComum da Humanidade n\u00e3o dever\u00e1 ser entendida como o planeta geogr\u00e1fico de 510 \n\nmilh\u00f5es de km2, mas antes deve ser representada atrav\u00e9s do favorable well-defined state \n\ndo Sistema Terrestre, relativo ao per\u00edodo geol\u00f3gico do Holoceno. E \u00e9 esta dimens\u00e3o \n\nqualitativa que escapa \u00e0 abordagem territorial. Em termos geogr\u00e1ficos um oceano morto \n\ne acidificado pode continuar a ser objeto de divis\u00f5es jur\u00eddicas entre soberanias, mas n\u00e3o \n\npode servir como suporte da vida marinha e da humanidade no seu todo. Da mesma forma \n\num planeta com um estado do Sistema Terrestre indesej\u00e1vel que n\u00e3o \u00e9 capaz de suportar \n\nas necessidades ecol\u00f3gicas da esp\u00e9cie humana, tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o pode ser considerado como \n\nnossa Casa Comum. \n\nEsta dimens\u00e3o funcional e qualitativa, ser\u00e1 ent\u00e3o a linha mestra de toda esta \n\ninvestiga\u00e7\u00e3o, que busca nos novos conhecimentos sobre o funcionamento do Sistema \n\nTerrestre, a base cient\u00edfica sobre a qual se vai aplicar o modelo do condom\u00ednio, recorrendo \n\nsempre a conceitos e institutos jur\u00eddicos j\u00e1 constru\u00eddos, e adaptando-as a esta realidade.  \n\nPor isso, para al\u00e9m das ci\u00eancias do Sistema Terrestre, integram-se conceitos como \n\nPatrim\u00f3nio da Humanidade, intangibilidade de objetos jur\u00eddicos, direito internacional, \n\ngest\u00e3o de bens comuns, economia ecol\u00f3gica, valoriza\u00e7\u00e3o de servi\u00e7os de ecossistemas, \n\nm\u00e9tricas e sistemas de contabilidade ecol\u00f3gica e o debate sobre os direitos das futuras \n\ngera\u00e7\u00f5es.  \n\nNa ess\u00eancia iremos procurar construir um objeto de direito que proceda a uma leitura \n\nmais aproximada da realidade ambiental, propondo-se uma cobertura jur\u00eddica \n\ninternacional ao Sistema Terrestre, tornando poss\u00edvel desta forma, distinguir a dimens\u00e3o \n\nespacial do planeta (o hardware), do sistema funcional global (Software) que suporta a \n\nvida na Terra. \n\nEsta dimens\u00e3o funcional e qualitativa do sistema terrestre pode ser determinante para \n\nse encontrarem os fundamentos sobre os quais se pode construir a Casa Comum que o \n\nPapa Francisco refere na sua Enc\u00edclica \u201cLaudato Si\u201d. No seu entender essa Casa Comum \n\nainda \u201cn\u00e3o est\u00e1 ainda constru\u00edda\u201d, quer isso dizer, que a nossa Casa Comum, n\u00e3o ser\u00e1 o \n\nplaneta f\u00edsico ou geogr\u00e1fico, mas sim uma constru\u00e7\u00e3o humana que potencie a constru\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nsimult\u00e2nea de harmonia no interior das sociedades humanas e entre estas o Sistema \n\nTerrestre. La Cura Della Casa Comune, ser\u00e1 ent\u00e3o o cuidado na manuten\u00e7\u00e3o da estrutura \n\nde concentra\u00e7\u00f5es biogeoqu\u00edmicas que determinam as condi\u00e7\u00f5es favor\u00e1veis \u00e0 fam\u00edlia \n\nhumana e a todas as esp\u00e9cies que partilham connosco as mesmas necessidades ecol\u00f3gicas. \n\nCuidar da Casa, implica criar as condi\u00e7\u00f5es estruturais pr\u00e9vias para uma a\u00e7\u00e3o coletiva \n\n\n\n 6 \n\nglobal. Por isso a Casa Comum da Humanidade, ser\u00e1 constru\u00e7\u00e3o jur\u00eddica baseada na \n\nci\u00eancia. \n\n \n\n \n\n 2. Metodologia e Objetivos gerais e espec\u00edficos \n\na) Objetivos gerais   \n\n \n\nAssumindo-se a ecologia humana como \u00e1rea de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o transdisciplinar privilegiada \n\npara a an\u00e1lise das intera\u00e7\u00f5es entre os sistemas sociais e sistemas ecol\u00f3gicos, e que nos \n\npode proporcionar uma leitura abrangente das mudan\u00e7as sociais e ambientais que \n\nresultam dessa intera\u00e7\u00e3o, iremos proceder a um poss\u00edvel desenho de compatibiliza\u00e7\u00e3o das \n\ncaracter\u00edsticas do funcionamento do Sistema Terrestre com a organiza\u00e7\u00e3o pol\u00edtica e social \n\nda comunidade global humana. Esta abordagem ser\u00e1, na sua ess\u00eancia, realizada atrav\u00e9s \n\nda procura de um novo objeto de direito que proceda a uma leitura mais aproximada da \n\nrealidade funcional do Sistema Terrestre, isto \u00e9, na busca de elementos de conex\u00e3o e \n\ncoer\u00eancia entre o sistema jur\u00eddico e o sistema ecol\u00f3gico, especialmente atrav\u00e9s do recurso \n\n\u00e0s recentes descobertas desenvolvidas pelas ci\u00eancias naturais e \u00e0 utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o, por analogia, \n\naos objetos jur\u00eddicos intang\u00edveis e ao modelo do condom\u00ednio.  A abordagem escolhida \u00e9 \n\na de estudar e desenvolver a intangibilidade jur\u00eddica como eixo norteador capaz de \n\ntraduzir e representar a essa qualidade intang\u00edvel do bem ambiental global \u2013 o estado \n\nfavor\u00e1vel do Sistema Terrestre. Sobre o assunto da intangibilidade jur\u00eddica C\u00e9sar Garcia \n\n(2016.15) afirma: \u201cTamanha mudan\u00e7a somente se torna poss\u00edvel quando se deixa de \n\npensar a realidade somente a partir do Direito, para permitir que o pr\u00f3prio Direito seja \n\nrepensado a partir da realidade.\u201d \n\nAo desmaterializarmos a natureza atrav\u00e9s do reconhecimento de Patrim\u00f3nio Comum \n\nNatural Intang\u00edvel da Humanidade, ou para ser mais correto, ao aceitarmos que a natureza \n\npossui elementos n\u00e3o territoriais, poderemos distinguir o espa\u00e7o soberano onde a \n\ninfraestrutura natural est\u00e1 localizada, dos servi\u00e7os e fun\u00e7\u00f5es incorp\u00f3reas que presta no \n\nseio do sistema natural global, abrindo portas \u00e0 valora\u00e7\u00e3o destes servi\u00e7os imateriais.  \n\nEsta ser\u00e1 a base jur\u00eddica que permitir\u00e1 a constru\u00e7\u00e3o de um sistema de contabilidade \n\ndos diferentes contributos de cada agente para o sistema natural comum que suporta a \n\nvida na Terra, e a constru\u00e7\u00e3o de uma economia onde os ativos intang\u00edveis naturais devem \n\n\n\n 7 \n\nter um papel central, e que desta forma poderia resultar numa harmoniza\u00e7\u00e3o entre os \n\nfluxos econ\u00f3micos e os fluxos ecol\u00f3gicos. \n\nA proposta de pensar a terra como um imenso condom\u00ednio, tem como objetivo central \n\naproveitar uma ferramenta jur\u00eddica j\u00e1 amplamente testada de sobreposi\u00e7\u00e3o de dois \n\nregimes legais distintos no interior do mesmo espa\u00e7o, conciliando desta forma interesses \n\nindividuais e coletivos, fornecendo assim uma base jur\u00eddica global que com potencial \n\npara enquadrar e contextualizar globalmente os interesses individualizados de cada um \n\ndos Estados com os interesses superiores de toda a Humanidade.  \n\nEsses interesses superiores existem, independentemente de n\u00e3o ser poss\u00edvel identificar \n\nos sujeitos de direito em rela\u00e7\u00f5es futuras e incertas.

Introdu\u00e7\u00e3o   \n\nA natureza, sabemo-lo hoje, \u00e9 n\u00e3o-linear, e como tal traz consigo a ideia de \n\nmultiplicidade, abertura, adaptabilidade, irreversibilidade e complexidade (Brown 1994 \n\n:420). \n\nNas primeiras palavras do pref\u00e1cio da \u201cIntrodu\u00e7\u00e3o ao Pensamento Complexo\u201d Morin \n\nintroduz-nos um pensamento que n\u00e3o abandonamos mais sempre nos confrontamos \n\ncom a palavra complexo: \u201cPedimos legitimamente ao pensamento que dissipe as brumas \n\ne as obscuridades, que ponha ordem e clareza no real, que revele as leis que o governam. \n\nA palavra complexidade s\u00f3 pode exprimir o nosso embara\u00e7o, a nossa confus\u00e3o, a nossa \n\nincapacidade de definir de maneira simples, de nomear de maneira clara, de p\u00f4r ordem \n\nnas nossas ideias\u201d. Mais \u00e0 frente afirma: \u201cA palavra complexidade \u00e9 uma palavra \n\nproblema, n\u00e3o uma palavra solu\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d (Morin1990: 7). \n\nNa \u00e9poca em que estas palavras foram escritas, os conhecimentos sobre as instru\u00e7\u00f5es \n\noperacionais intang\u00edveis que determinam a forma como o sistema terrestre se auto-\n\norganiza e regula eram praticamente nulos e sua exist\u00eancia, ainda que num plano \n\nmeramente te\u00f3rico e conceptual, suscitava aut\u00eanticos coros de rejei\u00e7\u00e3o. A hip\u00f3tese de \n\nGaia \u2013 em que James Lovelock (1991) formula pela primeira vez a possibilidade de o \n\n\n\n 10 \n\nPlaneta Terra funcionar como um sistema vivo que se auto-regula, foi considerada pela \n\nRevista Science de 19 de Abril de 1991, uma teoria \u201canticient\u00edfica\u201d, \u201cperigosa\u201d, \u201cpura \n\nfantasia\u201d.  \n\nHoje, depois de desvendados os core drivers que determinam o funcionamento do \n\nSistema Terrestre, os cientistas do sistema global - os Earth System Scientists - continuam \n\na defini-lo como um sistema altamente complexo, por duas ordens de raz\u00f5es: a) por lado \n\nexistem ainda muitas interconex\u00f5es desconhecidas, b) por outro, relativamente \u00e0s \n\ninterconex\u00f5es j\u00e1 conhecidas, os efeitos cascata originados pela introdu\u00e7\u00e3o de altera\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nnos seus componentes, que n\u00e3o podem ser analisados num modelo simples de causa-\n\nefeito, resultam em efeitos emergentes n\u00e3o conhecidos. Neste n\u00edvel nenhum fator atua de \n\nforma isolada, antes pelo contr\u00e1rio, \u00e9 um sistema onde \"tudo depende de tudo\" e onde \n\n\u201ctudo implica com tudo\u201d. Esta tautologia tem na escala global o seu campo perfeito de \n\naplica\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n\nMas se para chegar a esta consci\u00eancia da complexidade e de que \"tudo depende de \n\ntudo\", que s\u00f3 agora come\u00e7a a ser reconhecidamente aceite, teve de se percorrer um \"longo \n\ncaminho onde apareceriam em primeiro lugar os limites, as insufici\u00eancias e as car\u00eancias \n\ndo pensamento simplificador, depois as condi\u00e7\u00f5es nas quais n\u00e3o podemos evitar o desafio \n\ncomplexo\" (Morin1990:8). Na esteira do pensamento disjuntor cartesiano, constru\u00edmos \n\numa estrutura de organiza\u00e7\u00e3o das sociedades humanas baseada no paradigma no \n\nconhecimento segmentado, limitativo e isolador de cada \u00e1rea do saber, e que separa e \n\noculta tudo o que liga, interage, interconecta, tornando impercet\u00edvel o erro e as falhas das \n\ninterliga\u00e7\u00f5es. \u201cInfelizmente, a vis\u00e3o mutiladora e unidimensional paga-se cruelmente nos \n\nfen\u00f3menos humanos: a mutila\u00e7\u00e3o corta a carne, deita sangue, espalha sofrimento. A \n\nincapacidade de conceber a complexidade da realidade antroposocial na sua micro-\n\ndimens\u00e3o (o ser individual) e na sua macrodimens\u00e3o (o conjunto planet\u00e1rio da \n\nHumanidade) conduziu a infinitas trag\u00e9dias e conduz-nos \u00e0 trag\u00e9dia suprema\u201d (Morin \n\n1990:19). \n\nO \u201cimp\u00e9rio dos princ\u00edpios de disjun\u00e7\u00e3o, de redu\u00e7\u00e3o e de abstra\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d, cujo conjunto \n\nMorin chama de \u201cparadigma de simplifica\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d isolou radicalmente, na opini\u00e3o de Morin, \n\ncada um dos tr\u00eas grandes campos do conhecimento cient\u00edfico, relativamente a cada um \n\ndos outros - a f\u00edsica, a biologia, as ci\u00eancias do homem. \n\nCom Hobbes, o paradigma cartesiano invade tamb\u00e9m o direito e este torna-se numa \n\narte de estabelecer limites, de fazer a separa\u00e7\u00e3o das coisas, de desenhar fronteiras \n\nabstratas, naturalmente ocultando a realidade ent\u00e3o desconhecida do Sistema terrestre, \n\n\n\n 11 \n\nque existe para al\u00e9m da dimens\u00e3o territorial do planeta e cuja \u00fanica escala de \n\nfuncionamento \u00e9 a global. \u00c9 igualmente sob a vis\u00e3o ainda dominante do paradigma da \n\ndivis\u00e3o, que emerge um modelo econ\u00f3mico que defende que s\u00f3 o regime de propriedade \n\nprivada em associa\u00e7\u00e3o aos mecanismos de mercado est\u00e1 apto a ultrapassar a inevit\u00e1vel \n\n\u201cTrag\u00e9dia dos Bens Comuns\u201d (Hardin 1968), uma vez que nesta linha de racioc\u00ednio \n\napenas as pessoas com propriedade privada seriam motivadas a proteger suas terras do \n\nuso desregulado. A todos os n\u00edveis os sistemas de conhecimento e de organiza\u00e7\u00e3o social \n\nforam formatados para definir limites e n\u00e3o partes comuns. A formata\u00e7\u00e3o social daqui \n\nresultante pode-se resumir desta forma: a) tudo o que interliga e ultrapassa fronteiras \u00e9 \n\nsocialmente invis\u00edvel; b) pensar global \u00e9 uma quimera desconectada da realidade social; \n\nc) representar socialmente o global, uma impossibilidade t\u00e9cnica e categ\u00f3rica.  \n\nNesta linha de pensamento compreende-se que ainda hoje o que \u00e9 o comum seja \n\napenas o remanescente das divis\u00f5es operadas pelas soberanias ou pela propriedade \n\nprivada. \n\nAs falhas estruturais resultantes desta aus\u00eancia de interconex\u00f5es no pr\u00f3prio sistema \n\nde conhecimento e do sistema e organiza\u00e7\u00e3o social, deram origem a um processo interno \n\nde eros\u00e3o, como sequ\u00eancia l\u00f3gica da incapacidade destes sistemas em explicarem \n\nadequadamente a realidade natural e social. O resultado foi o alargamento da \u201cfatalidade\u201d \n\nda l\u00f3gica da \u201cTrag\u00e9dia do Comuns\u201d a uma realidade oculta e \u201cexterna\u201d - a escala global. \n\nAs altera\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas, como fen\u00f3meno mais vis\u00edvel de toda a amea\u00e7a ao estado do \n\nSistema Terrestre, s\u00e3o uma Trag\u00e9dia dos Comuns \u00e0 escala global \u2013 a disrup\u00e7\u00e3o dos \n\nmecanismos de suporte da vida - a Trag\u00e9dia Suprema, nas palavras de Morin.  \n\nNo plano jur\u00eddico, como plano estrutural da organiza\u00e7\u00e3o das sociedades humanas, esta \n\nterritorial obsession (Taylor 2016:120), tem como express\u00e3o m\u00e1xima a abstra\u00e7\u00e3o jur\u00eddica \n\nde considerar o planeta apenas num plano unidimensional, onde este corresponde a uma \n\n\u00e1rea total de 510.000.000 de km2 que foi dividida entre as soberanias e onde os Global \n\nCommons s\u00e3o apenas os remanescentes destas divis\u00f5es. Este continua a ser o modelo \n\n\u00fanico que determina o ponto a partir do qual todas as realidades s\u00e3o analisadas.  \n\nComo afirma Soromenho-Marques (1994:17) \u201cO homem age antes de saber\u201d. Mas \n\nquer queiramos ou n\u00e3o, foi esta separa\u00e7\u00e3o/organiza\u00e7\u00e3o/isolamento que possibilitou \n\nalcan\u00e7ar uma espantosa rede de informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre o mundo, que nos permite agora, quase \n\ncomo observadores externos, questionar todo o caminho j\u00e1 realizado.  \n\nNa posse de tantas informa\u00e7\u00f5es parcelares, podemos agora ambicionar passar da \n\ninforma\u00e7\u00e3o ao conhecimento do todo e, dar um passo decisivo no percurso civilizacional \n\n\n\n 12 \n\nda humanidade. Para isso, \u00e9 necess\u00e1ria uma opera\u00e7\u00e3o, uma conex\u00e3o entre a complexidade \n\nobjetiva da natureza e a nossa capacidade subjetiva de a representar no nosso sistema \n\nsocial.  \n\n\u00c9 nesta conjuntura que surge a Ecologia Humana, que como pr\u00f3prio nome indica, \n\npretende ser um espa\u00e7o de conhecimento onde as informa\u00e7\u00f5es provindas de todas as \n\nci\u00eancias, naturais ou humanas, se encontram e de alguma forma formar\u00e3o um \n\nconhecimento global e integrado.  \n\nMas como \u00e9 evidente, um projeto de construir uma ci\u00eancia unificadora, num contexto \n\nsocial profundamente enraizado em conhecimento espartilhado, n\u00e3o \u00e9 tarefa f\u00e1cil. \n\nEmbora seja hoje recorrente a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o das palavras inter, trans ou multidisciplinaridade, \n\na utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de palavras por si s\u00f3 n\u00e3o significa que esse conhecimento integrado seja uma \n\nrealidade. Em muitos casos, o exerc\u00edcio de nomea\u00e7\u00e3o destas palavras corresponde apenas \n\na uma proclama\u00e7\u00e3o da necessidade de encontrar uma ideia para um problema ainda n\u00e3o \n\nresolvido, como metodologia que incentive ao di\u00e1logo entre pessoas que foram formadas \n\nem diferentes silos, mas que muitas vezes s\u00e3o incapazes de correr o risco de sair da sua \n\n\u00e1rea de especializa\u00e7\u00e3o, da sua zona de seguran\u00e7a e criar um conhecimento \n\nverdadeiramente integrado. A inter, trans ou multidisciplinaridade nasceram como quase-\n\nconceitos, em que a sua validade atual se encontra como um ineg\u00e1vel e necess\u00e1rio projeto \n\nfuturo ainda n\u00e3o realizado. \n\nNo entanto, este dever-ser futuro confronta-se ainda hoje com problemas de afirma\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nrelativamente \u00e0s teias das compartimenta\u00e7\u00f5es dos saberes estabelecidos, onde o \n\n\u201ctransdisciplinar\u201d n\u00e3o encaixa nos modelos de valida\u00e7\u00e3o e delimita\u00e7\u00e3o existentes. Como \n\nIva Pires refere, a Ecologia Humana \u00e9 uma ci\u00eancia altamente especializada mantendo, ao \n\nmesmo tempo, uma vis\u00e3o hol\u00edstica, abrangente e transdisciplinar, condi\u00e7\u00e3o que a torna \n\ncomplexa e mesmo dif\u00edcil de ser definida (Pires 2011). \n\nNeste caminho de afirma\u00e7\u00e3o para Mcharg (1984: 53) \u201cO principal desafio que se \n\ncoloca \u00e0 ecologia humana \u00e9 da capacidade de s\u00edntese dos processos f\u00edsicos, biol\u00f3gicos, \n\nsociais, econ\u00f3micos e culturais para compreender as pessoas os lugares, observar as \n\nrela\u00e7\u00f5es sist\u00e9micas e coment\u00e1-las\u201d. Quando o projeto em causa tem como objetivo \n\ninterconectar as informa\u00e7\u00f5es e transform\u00e1-las em conhecimento, parece-nos que n\u00e3o \n\npoderemos fazer depender a sua valida\u00e7\u00e3o do cabal preenchimento do princ\u00edpios \n\nestruturais formais das metodologias cient\u00edficas herdadas do paradigma da disjun\u00e7\u00e3o - \n\nonde se constatou que \u201cos modos simplificadores do conhecimento mutilam mais do que \n\n\n\n 13 \n\nexprimem as realidades ou fen\u00f3menos que relatam, e se torna evidente que produzem \n\nmais confus\u00e3o que esclarecimento...\u201d(Morin 1990:7). \n\nMas o processo de transforma\u00e7\u00e3o da informa\u00e7\u00e3o em conhecimento \u00e9 um longo \n\npercurso, que por ser inevit\u00e1vel, come\u00e7ou j\u00e1 a ser feito parcelarmente em v\u00e1rias \u00e1reas \n\ncient\u00edficas, entre quais, a que consideramos mais evolu\u00edda e de maior relev\u00e2ncia, ser\u00e1 a \n\ndas ci\u00eancias naturais \u2013 as chamadas ci\u00eancias do Sistema Terrestre - onde a biologia n\u00e3o \n\nest\u00e1 separada da qu\u00edmica, matem\u00e1tica, geologia, paleontologia, climatologia ou da f\u00edsica. \n\nOs ciclos biogeof\u00edsicos globais, pela sua pr\u00f3pria formula\u00e7\u00e3o, s\u00e3o um sinal evidente da \n\nunifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos saberes na \u00fanica e verdadeira escala em que podemos transformar \n\ninforma\u00e7\u00e3o em conhecimento \u2013 a escala global. Esta evolu\u00e7\u00e3o inevit\u00e1vel para entender e \n\nrepresentar o \u201ctodo global\u201d, est\u00e1 ainda longe de possuir uma l\u00f3gica consistente \u00e0 escala \n\ndas ci\u00eancias humanas. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.2. Da Terra Incognita \u00e0s Ci\u00eancias do Sistema Terrestre \n\n \n\nCom a vis\u00e3o do Pr\u00edncipe Infante D. Henrique foi poss\u00edvel iniciar o processo de \n\ntransformar a Terra incognita (termo utilizado na cartografia dos s\u00e9culos XV/XVI para \n\nassinalar as regi\u00f5es nunca mapeadas ou documentadas) em Terra conhecida. Esta epopeia \n\nde descoberta culmina de alguma forma com a viagem de Fern\u00e3o de Magalh\u00e3es, onde \n\npela primeira vez na hist\u00f3ria se p\u00f4de voltar ao ponto de origem sem voltar para tr\u00e1s, e se \n\npercebeu a forma e os limites f\u00edsicos da nossa Casa Comum. Sabemos hoje, que este passo \n\nde gigante na hist\u00f3ria da perce\u00e7\u00e3o que a esp\u00e9cie humana tem do planeta que habita, era \n\napenas ao n\u00edvel do espa\u00e7o geogr\u00e1fico. \n\nDepois das \u201cTerra Incognitas\u201d terem desaparecido dos nossos mapas, tivemos que \n\nesperar at\u00e9 \u00e0 segunda metade do S\u00e9culo XX para perceber que para al\u00e9m do planeta na \n\nsua dimens\u00e3o geogr\u00e1fica, f\u00edsica e palp\u00e1vel, existia um sistema funcional global, cujo o \n\nmodo de funcionamento estava ainda por descobrir. Quando Lovelock percebeu, nos \n\nfinais dos anos 60 do S\u00e9c. XX que os CFC\u2019s emitidos para a atmosfera n\u00e3o desapareciam \n\nno espa\u00e7o infinito e acumulavam-se nos polos, uma nova realidade se revelou. De passo \n\nem passo a ci\u00eancia foi desvendando o n\u00edvel superior de integra\u00e7\u00e3o do Sistema Terrestre, \n\nde interconex\u00f5es globais de dif\u00edcil defini\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n\n\n\n 14 \n\nCom o desenvolvimento exponencial das ci\u00eancias do Sistema Terrestre ocorrido nos \n\n\u00faltimos 25 anos e a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o das observa\u00e7\u00f5es da Terra realizadas a partir do espa\u00e7o, o \n\nsistema incrivelmente complexo do planeta que habitamos transformou-se numa \n\nrealidade que podemos observar em tempo real, como espectadores externos.  \n\nAo juntarmos a informa\u00e7\u00e3o obtida partir do espa\u00e7o com a informa\u00e7\u00e3o recolhida a \n\npartir do solo e do gelo (por exemplo a paleontologia do clima), tornou-se poss\u00edvel \n\nreconstruir a hist\u00f3ria da atmosfera e todo o Sistema Terrestre. Ao longo da hist\u00f3ria do \n\nnosso planeta, foram muitas as diferentes estruturas de composi\u00e7\u00f5es qu\u00edmicas da \n\natmosfera e dos oceanos, que deram origem a diferentes balan\u00e7os energ\u00e9ticos e \n\nequil\u00edbrios termodin\u00e2micos, que por sua vez resultaram em diferentes estados do Sistema \n\nTerrestre. O acesso a esta informa\u00e7\u00e3o permitiu-nos a compreender a verdadeira situa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\n\u00fanica que caracterizou o per\u00edodo de estabilidade clim\u00e1tica dos \u00faltimos 11.700 anos no \n\nPlaneta Terra, o chamado o per\u00edodo geol\u00f3gico do Holoceno. \n\nSe \u00e9 a partir de Portugal que saem muitas das naus nas viagens oce\u00e2nicas dos \n\ns\u00e9culos XV e XVI que iniciam o processo de reconhecimento do espa\u00e7o geogr\u00e1fico global \n\nda nossa Casa Comum, n\u00e3o deixa de ser interessante o facto de a unifica\u00e7\u00e3o das ci\u00eancias \n\nnaturais, e o consequente processo de decifra\u00e7\u00e3o do funcionamento do sistema terrestre, \n\nter liga\u00e7\u00f5es com Portugal, como afirma Will Steffen, Executive-Director do IGBP \n\n(International Geosphere-Biospehere Program) e editor principal do \u201cGlobal Change and \n\nthe Earth System\u201d de 2004 (considerado ainda hoje o estudo mais abrangente sobre o \n\nSistema Terrestre) : \u201cIn fact, this rapidly emerging knowledge of the Earth as a single, \n\nintegrated system also has some interesting connections to Portugal. One the first \n\nconceptualization in the contemporary era of the Earth as a system was by James \n\nLovelock, who used the name \u201cGaia\u201d (name of the Greek Goddess of Earth) for the Earth \n\nSystem. This, of course, is the name of the city that sits across the Douro River from Porto, \n\nand the combination of the twin cities Porto and Gaia formed the basis for the name of \n\nthe country as Portugal. \n\nArguably the most influential international scientific body in the development of the \n\nconcept of the Earth System has been the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme \n\n(IGBP). Interestingly, the most critical meeting of the IGBP Scientific Meeting was held \n\nin 1999 in Estoril, Portugal1. There the Committee determined the objective, scope and \n\nwork plan for the production of the IGBP synthesis project, which resulted in the book \n\n                                                \n1http://www.igbp.net/download/18.950c2fa1495db7081e131/1416232597277/NL_371999.pdf \n\n\n\n 15 \n\n\u201cGlobal Change and the Earth System: A Planet Under Pressure\u201d, still one of the best \n\nsyntheses of Earth System science. The Estoril meeting also initiated the planning for the \n\n2001 Amsterdam Conference, which was the world\u2019s largest global change scientific \n\nconference up to that time. \n\nThe Estoril meeting also featured an explicit link to Ferdinand Magellan and the age \n\nof Portuguese exploration. The IGBP Scientific Committee visited the Portuguese \n\nAcademy of Sciences in Lisbon, where the scientists had the fortune to see the original \n\nnavigational maps of Ferdinand Magellan, where for the first time the islands of Japan \n\nappear on a map in the western world. \n\nInspired by this link to the great age of global exploration, the IGBP Chairman Berrien \n\nMoore III, as he looked out over the Atlantic Ocean from the conference room in Estoril, \n\nchallenged the IGBP scientific community to go out on their own voyage of scientific \n\nexploration to understand our home planet as a single system \u2013 our own life support \n\nsystem.  \n\nSo, from the perspective of Earth System science, it would be truly fitting for the \n\nCommon Home of Humankind to be located in Portugal, and in Porto in particular\u201d  \n\nComo referido, esta 14\u00aa\u00aa reuni\u00e3o Scientific Commitee do IGBP que decorreu entre os \n\ndias 23 a 27 de Fevereiro de 1999 no Estoril, esteve na origem da evolu\u00e7\u00e3o do conceito \n\navan\u00e7ado por Lovelock, que viria a resultar numa abordagem integrada e pluridisciplinar \n\nno \u00e2mbito das ci\u00eancias naturais ao Sistema Terrestre como um \u00fanico todo. Esta evolu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nresultou na pr\u00e1tica num processo gradual de unifica\u00e7\u00e3o das ci\u00eancias naturais \u2013 que est\u00e3o \n\nna base e origem das chamadas Ci\u00eancias dos Sistema Terrestre.  \n\nNa sequencia da reuni\u00e3o do Estoril, e numa parceria do IGBP e de outros programas \n\ninternacionais de mudan\u00e7a global, ficou decidida a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de uma grande confer\u00eancia \n\nem Amsterd\u00e3o em 2001, que marcou em definitivo a formaliza\u00e7\u00e3o desta unifica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ncient\u00edfica. A confer\u00eancia produziu a hist\u00f3rica Declara\u00e7\u00e3o de Amsterd\u00e3o sobre Ci\u00eancia do \n\nSistema da Terrestre, que reproduzimos aqui: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 16 \n\nThe Declaration2 \n \nThe scientific communities of four international global change research programs - the \n\nInternational Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP), the International Human Dimensions \n\nProgramme on Global Environmental Change (IHDP), the World Climate Research Programme \n\n(WCRP) and the international biodiversity programme DIVERSITAS - recognise that, in addition \n\nto the threat of significant climate change, there is growing concern over the ever-increasing \n\nhuman modification of other aspects of the global environment and the consequent \n\nimplications for human well-being.  \n\n \n\nBasic goods and services supplied by the planetary life support system, such as food, water, \n\nclean air and an environment conducive to human health, are being affected increasingly by \n\nglobal change. \n\nResearch carried out over the past decade under the auspices of the four programmes to \n\naddress these concerns has shown that: \n\n \n\n\u2022 The Earth System behaves as a single, self-regulating system comprised of physical, \nchemical, biological and human components. The interactions and feedbacks between \n\nthe component parts are complex and exhibit multi-scale temporal and spatial \n\nvariability. The understanding of the natural dynamics of the Earth System has \n\nadvanced greatly in recent years and provides a sound basis for evaluating the effects \n\nand consequences of human-driven change. \n\n\u2022 Human activities are significantly influencing Earth's environment in many ways in \naddition to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Anthropogenic changes to \n\nEarth's land surface, oceans, coasts and atmosphere and to biological diversity, the \n\nwater cycle and biogeochemical cycles are clearly identifiable beyond natural \n\nvariability. They are equal to some of the great forces of nature in their extent and \n\nimpact. Many are accelerating. Global change is real and is happening now. \n\n\u2022 Global change cannot be understood in terms of a simple cause-effect paradigm. \nHuman-driven changes cause multiple effects that cascade through the Earth System \n\nin complex ways. These effects interact with each other and with local- and regional-\n\nscale changes in multidimensional patterns that are difficult to understand and even \n\nmore difficult to predict. Surprises abound. \n\n\u2022 Earth System dynamics are characterised by critical thresholds and abrupt changes. \nHuman activities could inadvertently trigger such changes with severe consequences \n\nfor Earth's environment and inhabitants. The Earth System has operated in different \n\nstates over the last half million years, with abrupt transitions (a decade or less) \n\nsometimes occurring between them. Human activities have the potential to switch the \n\nEarth System to alternative modes of operation that may prove irreversible and less \n\n                                                \n2http://www.igbp.net/about/history/2001amsterdamdeclarationonearthsystemscience.4.1b8ae20512db692f2a6800013\n12.html \n\n\n\n 17 \n\nhospitable to humans and other life. The probability of a human-driven abrupt change \n\nin Earth's environment has yet to be quantified but is not negligible. \n\n\u2022 In terms of some key environmental parameters, the Earth System has moved well \noutside the range of the natural variability exhibited over the last half million \n\nyears at least. The nature of changes now occurring simultaneously in the Earth \n\nSystem, their magnitudes and rates of change are unprecedented. The Earth is \n\ncurrently operating in a no-analogue state. \n\n \n\nOn this basis, the international global change programmes urge governments, public and \n\nprivate institutions and people of the world to agree that: \n\n \n\n\u2022 An ethical framework for global stewardship and strategies for Earth System \nmanagement are urgently needed.  The accelerating human transformation of the \n\nEarth's environment is not sustainable. Therefore, the business-as-usual way of \n\ndealing with the Earth System is not an option. It has to be replaced \u00ac as soon as \n\npossible \u00ac by deliberate strategies of good management that sustain the Earth's \n\nenvironment while meeting social and economic development objectives. \n\n\u2022 A new system of global environmental science is required. This is beginning to evolve \nfrom complementary approaches of the international global change research \n\nprogrammes and needs strengthening and further development. It will draw strongly \n\non the existing and expanding disciplinary base of global change science; integrate \n\nacross disciplines, environment and development issues and the natural and social \n\nsciences; collaborate across national boundaries on the basis of shared and secure \n\ninfrastructure; intensify efforts to enable the full involvement of developing country \n\nscientists; and employ the complementary strengths of nations and regions to build \n\nan efficient international system of global environmental science. \n\n \n\nThe global change programmes are committed to working closely with other sectors of society \n\nand across all nations and cultures to meet the challenge of a changing Earth. New partnerships \n\nare forming among university, industrial and governmental research institutions. Dialogues \n\nare increasing between the scientific community and policymakers at a number of levels. \n\nAction is required to formalise, consolidate and strengthen the initiatives being developed. The \n\ncommon goal must be to develop the essential knowledge base needed to respond effectively \n\nand quickly to the great challenge of global change. \n\n \n\nA consequ\u00eancia imediata deste marco hist\u00f3rico foi o recente desenvolvimento \n\nexponencial das Ci\u00eancias do Sistema Terrestre com a sua abordagem interdisciplinar e \n\nglobal, proporcionando-nos informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre a natureza e os limites da \u00c9poca do \n\n\n\n 18 \n\nHoloceno, como o \u00fanico estado do Sistema da Terra que possui, com certeza, as \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es ecol\u00f3gicas necess\u00e1rias para suportar sociedades humanas complexas e \n\ncontempor\u00e2neas.  \n\nCom esta nova abordagem global das ci\u00eancias naturais, ficou claramente demonstrado \n\nque o grande desafio ambiental ser\u00e1 o de manter um estado relativamente est\u00e1vel e \n\nfavor\u00e1vel do Sistema Terrestre.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigura 1.

Note the \nrelative stability of temperature for the last 11,700 years (the Holocene) compared to the earlier ice age period. \n(Steffen2016:24) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEsta afirma\u00e7\u00e3o significa tamb\u00e9m que um Planeta com um Sistema Terrestre fora desse \n\nestado favor\u00e1vel, n\u00e3o serve como nossa \u201cCasa Comum\u201d, o que tem como consequ\u00eancia \n\nimediata a desterritorializa\u00e7\u00e3o do bem ambiental e a assun\u00e7\u00e3o da escala que vai \n\ndeterminar todos os processos locais: a escala global. \n\nA comunidade cient\u00edfica tentou responder ao desafio de entender e medir este espa\u00e7o \n\nqualitativo e quantitativo, n\u00e3o-territorial, intang\u00edvel e funcional, desenvolvendo o \n\n\n\n 19 \n\nconceito das Planetary Boundaries \u2013 os limites do planeta (Planetary Boundaries) \n\n(Steffen et al., 2015, Rockstr\u00f6m et al., 2009). Esses limites s\u00e3o baseados nas propriedades \n\nintr\u00ednsecas do pr\u00f3prio sistema terrestre e que se definem atrav\u00e9s de uma combina\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nindicadores (core drivers) que no seu conjunto s\u00e3o as instru\u00e7\u00f5es operacionais intang\u00edveis \n\nque determinam o modo como o Sistema Terrestre se auto-organiza e regula. Por outras \n\npalavras, este conjunto de indicadores ser\u00e1 o \u201cc\u00f3digo gen\u00e9tico\u201d do funcionamento do \n\nsistema terrestre que traduz em n\u00fameros as intui\u00e7\u00f5es iniciais de Lovelock, descrevendo \n\no estado do sistema terrestre, atrav\u00e9s de um conjunto de limites cientificamente \n\nestabelecidos que definem um estado do Sistema da Terrestre baseado nos \u00faltimos 11.700 \n\nanos \u2013 a \u00e9poca do Holoceno - limites que devemos respeitar para manter o Sistema da \n\nTerrestre nesse estado favor\u00e1vel.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nFigura 2. The current status of the control variables for seven of the nine planetary boundaries. Green zone is the \n\nsafe operating space (below the boundary), yellow represents the zone of uncertainty (increasing risk), and red is the \nhigh-risk zone. The planetary boundary itself lies at the inner heavy circle. The control variables have been normalized \nfor the zone of uncertainty (between the two heavy circles); the center of the figure therefore does not represent values \nof 0 for the control variables. The control variable shown for climate change is atmospheric CO2 concentration. \nProcesses for which global-level boundaries cannot yet be quantified are represented by gray wedges; these are \natmospheric aerosol loading, novel entities and the functional role of biosphere integrity.

Este \u201cespa\u00e7o\u201d de opera\u00e7\u00e3o segura para a humanidade \u00e9 \n\nglobal, intang\u00edvel, totalmente interdependente, indivis\u00edvel e, portanto, um inultrapass\u00e1vel \n\ne incontorn\u00e1vel bem comum. O conjunto destas caracter\u00edsticas, tornou-se num dos fatores \n\nque mais desafia uma organiza\u00e7\u00e3o social ainda dominada por uma vis\u00e3o que considera \n\nque a gest\u00e3o de bens comuns resulta numa inevit\u00e1vel \u201cTrag\u00e9dia dos Bens Comuns\u201d. Na \n\nimpossibilidade de dividir o bem, a solu\u00e7\u00e3o tem sido a de tentar minorar a dimens\u00e3o da \n\ntrag\u00e9dia sem, no entanto, se proceder \u00e0 necess\u00e1ria reorganiza\u00e7\u00e3o interna das rela\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nimposta pelo uso compartilhado de um bem finito, indivis\u00edvel e intang\u00edvel.  Sabemos hoje \n\nque existem alternativas e que em determinadas condi\u00e7\u00f5es a a\u00e7\u00e3o coletiva \u00e9 uma \n\npossibilidade.  \n\n \n\n1.3. A Ecologia Humana \u2013 Uma nova era no conhecimento? \n\n \n\nAinda que numa fase de consolida\u00e7\u00e3o, as ci\u00eancias do Sistema Terrestre s\u00e3o resultado do \n\nconfronto inevit\u00e1vel entre a segmenta\u00e7\u00e3o parcelar das informa\u00e7\u00f5es obtidas pelas v\u00e1rias \n\nci\u00eancias da natureza e o suprassistema da escala global, onde tudo interage e onde nada \n\nexiste de forma isolada. Porque esta subida de escala \u00e9 uma realidade incontorn\u00e1vel para \n\nque se \u201cdissipe as brumas e as obscuridades, que ponha ordem e clareza no real, que \n\nrevele as leis que o governam\u201d (Morin 1990:7), questionaram-se paradigmas, \n\ndesenvolveram-se novas metodologias e novas formas de pensar para construir um novo \n\nconhecimento. Ali\u00e1s sempre que a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00e9cnica alarga o campo de vis\u00e3o do \n\nconhecimento e novas ci\u00eancias surgem, uma s\u00e9rie de novas perguntas e de \n\nreenquadramentos emergem como consequ\u00eancia natural. Na \u00e1rea das ci\u00eancias da vida por \n\nexemplo, os novos conhecimentos deram origem a novos significados \u00e9ticos. Nunes \n\n(2002:12) afirma mesmo que, \"Uma \u00e9tica fundada na dignidade humana pressup\u00f5e, \n\nnecessariamente, que novos conhecimentos na \u00e1rea das ci\u00eancias biol\u00f3gicas possam \n\nquestionar axiomas considerados imut\u00e1veis, de modo a proporcionar - atrav\u00e9s de uma \n\nan\u00e1lise introspetiva permanente - uma mudan\u00e7a gradual da vis\u00e3o antropol\u00f3gica do \n\nhomem\u201d.  \n\nRelativamente \u00e0 Ecologia, ainda antes de se lhe adicionar a palavra humana, \n\nSoromenho-Marques (1994:16) j\u00e1 afirmava: \u201cNessa medida, a ecologia n\u00e3o se limita a \n\nser mais uma ci\u00eancia particular a adicionar a outras ci\u00eancias a outras ci\u00eancias particulares. \n\nNo plano epistemol\u00f3gico, ela surge essencialmente como desafio conducente \u00e0 \n\n\n\n 21 \n\nconstru\u00e7\u00e3o de um novo modelo de unidade das ci\u00eancias, um novo corpus das ci\u00eancias \n\ncapaz de refletir ao n\u00edvel dos m\u00e9todos de trabalho e investiga\u00e7\u00e3o essa profunda unidade \n\nobjetiva do homem com todos os outros habitantes deste pequeno, mas magn\u00edfico mundo \n\nplanet\u00e1rio.\u201d \n\nEste exerc\u00edcio de confronto e conex\u00e3o dos novos conhecimentos das ci\u00eancias do Sistema \n\nTerrestre com os velhos axiomas das organiza\u00e7\u00f5es sociais, ser\u00e1 mesmo uma condi\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ncateg\u00f3rica para aferir a intencionalidade do agir humano, na sua rela\u00e7\u00e3o com o sistema \n\nenvolvente.  Desta forma, esta aferi\u00e7\u00e3o pr\u00e9via ser\u00e1 igualmente pressuposto de legitima\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ne valida\u00e7\u00e3o das constru\u00e7\u00f5es sociais humanas. \n\nDaqui resulta que nos parece inevit\u00e1vel que a descodifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos core drivers que \n\ndeterminam o funcionamento do Sistema Terrestre e dos suportes da vida, constituam \n\ninforma\u00e7\u00f5es que em muito dever\u00e3o condicionar e moldar os paradigmas at\u00e9 hoje \n\nconstru\u00eddos e que continuam a ser considerados imut\u00e1veis. Um Sistema Terrestre \n\ninterdependente e indivis\u00edvel, se foi e continua a ser um enorme desafio para as ci\u00eancias \n\nnaturais, ser\u00e1 ainda maior no caso espec\u00edfico das ci\u00eancias sociais. Pelas suas interliga\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ne escala \u00e9 um desafio \u00e0 forma de pensar e a tudo o que isso representa. \n\nA quest\u00e3o coloca-se desde logo porque, como afirma Corraliza (1997:27), a \"Crise \n\nambiental es una expresion infeliz, ya que m\u00e1s bien se trata de problemas de-la-\n\nhumanidad\". Se nos lembrarmos tamb\u00e9m que foi a atividade humana que provocou os \n\nchamados \u201cproblemas ambientais\u201d e que essas altera\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais, por sua vez, ir\u00e3o \n\ninterferir na qualidade de vida dessas mesmas pessoas, concluiremos que esses problemas \n\ns\u00e3o, na verdade, problemas da humanidade.  Portanto, a origem dos problemas h\u00e1 que \n\nbusc\u00e1-la na deficiente adapta\u00e7\u00e3o das sociedades humanas \u00e0s circunst\u00e2ncias que impostas \n\npelo meio em que se encontram. Soromenho-Marques (1994:65) vai mais longe e faz a \n\ns\u00edntese: \u201cA Natureza j\u00e1 n\u00e3o \u00e9 mais do que uma forma diferida do homem falar de si \n\npr\u00f3prio, um campo onde se projetam os seus sonhos, a sua desmesura, a sua paix\u00e3o de \n\ninfinito\u201d. \n\nPosteriormente, foram as pr\u00f3prias Ci\u00eancias do Sistema Terrestre, que vieram ao \n\nencontro desta vis\u00e3o e ainda a tornaram mais integrada. Os problemas do ambiente s\u00e3o \n\nproblemas do homem, uma vez que a esp\u00e9cie humana \u00e9 parte integral do Sistema \n\nTerrestre: \u201cThe Earth System is defined as the interacting physical, chemical and \n\nbiological processes that cycle materials and energy throughout the system at the \n\nplanetary level. Importantly, humans and our activities are an integral part of the ES \n\n(Oldfield and Steffen 2004). It is critical for the planetary boundaries framework to \n\n\n\n 22 \n\nrecognize that the Earth System is a single complex system that exists in well-defined \n\nstates like all complex systems, the ES exhibits threshold/abrupt change behaviour in \n\naspects of atmospheric and oceanic circulation, which, if triggered, would create serious \n\nrisks for human well-being (Steffen 2016:24).\u201d \n\nO auto-isolamento conceptual da esp\u00e9cie humana relativamente \u00e0 sua depend\u00eancia \n\nsist\u00e9mica no seio do Sistema Terrestre, ser\u00e1 com certeza uns dos maiores erros na hist\u00f3ria \n\ndas perce\u00e7\u00f5es humanas: \u201cA ecologia tradicional, ao se preocupar tanto com os aspectos \n\nf\u00edsicos e bioqu\u00edmicos da natureza, solidificando uma ecologia dos bichos e outra ecologia \n\ndas plantas, deixou de fora um grupo-chave para o entendimento das din\u00e2micas dos \n\necossistemas: a esp\u00e9cie humana, objeto-sujeito da Ecologia Humana.\u201d (Marques \n\n2011.86).  \u00c9 neste contexto que a Ecologia Humana surge com a tarefa de colocar \u201cum \n\nfim na ant\u00edtese entre natureza e a sociedade, significando que a natureza n\u00e3o pode ser \n\nmais percebida fora da sociedade, ou a sociedade fora da natureza, os problemas \n\nambientais n\u00e3o s\u00e3o problemas do ambiente que nos rodeia, mas antes inteiramente \n\nproblemas sociais. S\u00e3o uma forma peculiar de problemas sociais, j\u00e1 que apesar de \n\nrepresentarem problemas para a sociedade, embora parecem ser problemas no ambiente \n\n(Yearley, 2004:87). \n\nO projeto de integra\u00e7\u00e3o dos novos conhecimentos obtidos pelas ci\u00eancias do Sistema \n\nTerrestre implica subir ainda mais na escala das interliga\u00e7\u00f5es, procedendo-se a uma \n\nconex\u00e3o entre as ci\u00eancias sociais e as ci\u00eancias naturais, tornando o desafio da Ecologia \n\nHumana verdadeiramente civilizacional.  \n\nA tarefa \u00e9 tudo menos simples e requer tamb\u00e9m por parte dos te\u00f3ricos da Ecologia \n\nHumana um novo pensamento, que n\u00e3o fique ref\u00e9m das metodologias e sistemas de \n\nvalida\u00e7\u00e3o constru\u00eddos sob o paradigma disjuntivo. Desde logo, o problema de defini\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde um objeto cient\u00edfico aut\u00f3nomo deve ab inicio demarcar-se da preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o da sua \n\nvalida\u00e7\u00e3o e delimita\u00e7\u00e3o relativamente \u00e0s ci\u00eancias previamente estabelecidas: \u201cA \n\ndin\u00e2mica da Ecologia Humana em sua base cient\u00edfica tenta, dentro das condi\u00e7\u00f5es \n\npropostas, incorporar em si um pouco de cada \u00e1rea, sobretudo na tentativa de \n\ncompreender, analisar e valorar n\u00e3o apenas o homem ou o entorno. A sua ess\u00eancia, na \n\nverdade, parte da constru\u00e7\u00e3o de uma base filos\u00f3fica do espa\u00e7o-tempo na forma\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\nindividuo e do coletivo. Por este motivo, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 como negar sua import\u00e2ncia, \n\nespecialmente na evolu\u00e7\u00e3o do conhecimento das ci\u00eancias \u201cn\u00e3o-tecnol\u00f3gicas\u201d, tornando-\n\nse um marco de vis\u00e3o interdisciplinar, revolucionando a vis\u00e3o acad\u00e9mica, sobretudo a \n\nsociologia e antropologia modernas que viram nas bases da ecologia te\u00f3rica um novo \n\n\n\n 23 \n\nmarco cient\u00edfico como fonte de pesquisa integracionista. Assim, pode-se dizer que a sua \n\nexpress\u00e3o \u00e9 fruto de uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o concreta e de forte interdepend\u00eancia do Antropo, \n\ndecorrente de sua a\u00e7\u00e3o direta ou indireta com o meio f\u00edsico-natural. \u201c(Alvim 2014:23) \n\nUma ci\u00eancia que desde a sua formula\u00e7\u00e3o inicial pretende colher saberes de todas as \n\noutras ci\u00eancias, que \u201ccoloca gente nos ecossistemas e situa-se nas inquieta\u00e7\u00f5es sobre essa \n\nrela\u00e7\u00e3o entre a esp\u00e9cie humana e os ecossistemas.\u201d (Marques 2011:86), que tem como \n\nambi\u00e7\u00e3o fazer pontes e integrar o todo tornando-se a Unifying Science, Bruhn (1974:105), \n\ntem obviamente um longo percurso a fazer na afirma\u00e7\u00e3o de um campo de estudo sobre o \n\ntodo, onde a aus\u00eancia limita\u00e7\u00f5es vai continuar a ser um dos principais obst\u00e1culos ao seu \n\nreconhecimento. Bruhn (1974:119) faz um estudo aprofundado em que tenta distinguir a \n\nEcologia Humana das ci\u00eancias j\u00e1 estabelecidas e dissipar a relut\u00e2ncia dos \u201cself-interests\u201d \n\ndos saberes especializados em aceitarem uma ci\u00eancia unificadora: \u201cIt would appear that \n\nthe major limitation in human ecology becoming a unifying science is the self-interest of \n\ndisciplines and the hence an incomplete conceptualization of man-environment relations. \n\nThere are viable but as yet largely untested schemes for studying and understanding man-\n\nenvironment relations as a series of interdependent systems. For example, Michaelson \n\n(1970) states that space has been used as a medium in ecological studies rather than a \n\nvariable with a potential effect of its own. Similarly, environment has been referred to by \n\nhuman ecologists as the social environment without regard to how the physical \n\nenvironment supports or elicits certain social behavior. When the social and physical \n\nenvironments are viewed as interdependent systems, it is possible to examine how \n\nchanges in the state or variables in one system affect the state or variables in the other \n\n(process). In addition, it is possible to study the coexistence of variables or factors that \n\nbring about congruence (adaption) or incongruence (maladaptation) as the two systems \n\ninteract. He notes that, since any relations existing between environment and social \n\nbehavior are a function of cultural values and perceptions, it is important to investigate \n\nthe way in which physical, social and cultural variables articulate with each other to \n\nelicit observed behavior.\u201d \n\nNa nossa an\u00e1lise, o estudo das inter-rela\u00e7\u00f5es entre sistemas sociais e Sistema Terrestre, \n\nque revelam adapta\u00e7\u00e3o ou n\u00e3o-adapta\u00e7\u00e3o na intera\u00e7\u00e3o dos dois sistemas, ser\u00e1 o fator \n\ndeterminante para que seja poss\u00edvel o reconhecimento desse estatuto de overview science, \n\nno caso de este estudo ser realizado com o objetivo da procura de solu\u00e7\u00f5es. Como afirma \n\nnovamente Bruhn (1974.120) \u201cIf Human ecology is concerned with the interrelationships \n\nbetween man and this environment and with the process that affect changes in these \n\n\n\n 24 \n\ninterrelationships, it is apparent that single disciplinary studies of these processes can \n\nprovide only small glimpses of the total ecological complex. While theoretical debates \n\namong disciplines and reformulations of human ecology are sometimes fruitful, what is \n\nperhaps most disturbing is that the concepts, principles, and methods of human ecology \n\nused in geography, anthropology, sociology, and psychology are not so different to justify \n\nthe lack of interdisciplinary studies. While is not popular to advocate such studies in \n\nuniversities or to propose that research be more oriented toward reaching solutions to \n\ncurrent human ecological problems, these appear to be worth serious consideration if \n\nhuman ecology is indeed to ever become, in practice, a unifying science.\u201d \n\n Se a \u201cnecessidade de procurar respostas para compreender as complexas \n\nintera\u00e7\u00f5es entre processos sociais, econ\u00f3micos e ecol\u00f3gicos marcou em definitivo o \n\ncar\u00e1cter interdisciplinar da ecologia humana\u201d (Pires; Craveiro 2010:26), e que levou \n\nigualmente \u00e0 \u201cnecessidade de produzir conhecimento para compreender a rela\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\nhomem com o seu ambiente, para responder \u00e0 interroga\u00e7\u00e3o de qual o seu lugar na \n\nnatureza\u201d (Pires; Craveiro 2011:15), est\u00e3o criados os pressupostos program\u00e1ticos iniciais \n\npara que a Ecologia Humana possa ambicionar ser essa ponte instrumental de procura de \n\nsolu\u00e7\u00f5es integradas baseadas na investiga\u00e7\u00e3o pluridisciplinar. \n\nSe entendermos esta \u201crela\u00e7\u00e3o entre homem e o ambiente\u201d na sua devida escala \u2013 a \n\nescala global - colocando a Humanidade no seio do Sistema Terrestre, e se o estudo destas \n\nrela\u00e7\u00f5es tiver como finalidade \u00faltima a procura de solu\u00e7\u00f5es para transformar a n\u00e3o\u2013\n\nadapta\u00e7\u00e3o do modelo existente em propostas de adapta\u00e7\u00e3o, estar\u00e3o criadas as condi\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nnecess\u00e1rias para que a Ecologia Humana possa aspirar a ser reconhecida como uma \n\nci\u00eancia verdadeiramente unificadora per se.   \n\n \n\n \n\n1.4. Uma Ecologia Humana \u00e0 escala do Sistema Terrestre \n\n \n\nSe o motivo fundador da ecologia humana surge como um resultado emergente da \n\ncrise de adapta\u00e7\u00e3o do homem ao ambiente, era inevit\u00e1vel que esta ci\u00eancia tamb\u00e9m \n\ntrilhasse o caminho que as pr\u00f3prias ci\u00eancias ecol\u00f3gicas trilharam. Nas \u00faltimas tr\u00eas \n\nd\u00e9cadas assistiu-se a uma \u00eanfase nas perspetivas dedutivas, simplificadoras e \n\nexperimentais para estudar a estrutura e a din\u00e2mica dos sistemas ecol\u00f3gicos. As an\u00e1lises \n\nemp\u00edricas tendiam para efetuar manipula\u00e7\u00f5es, em pequena escala e no curto prazo, de \n\n\n\n 25 \n\nsistemas relativamente simples, a fim de investigar as intera\u00e7\u00f5es entre esp\u00e9cies e entre \n\norganismos e o respetivo ambiente abi\u00f3tico. Nos anos mais recentes, por\u00e9m, um n\u00famero \n\ncrescente de cientistas come\u00e7ou a adotar programas de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o muito mais \n\nhol\u00edsticos. Esta viragem foi produto, numa parte, da necessidade pr\u00e1tica de estudar os \n\nproblemas ambientais causados pelos pr\u00f3prios seres humanos e, noutra parte, dos avan\u00e7os \n\nconceptuais, metodol\u00f3gicos e tecnol\u00f3gicos registados no estudo do Sistema Terrestre.  \n\nEsta evolu\u00e7\u00e3o entre a fragmenta\u00e7\u00e3o e a progressiva aceita\u00e7\u00e3o do desafio do complexo, \n\nj\u00e1 anteriormente identificado por Morin (1999), foi igualmente inevit\u00e1vel neste percurso \n\nda Ecologia Humana. Depois de uma fase inicial em que o objeto do estudo da Ecologia \n\nHumana estava centrado na an\u00e1lise do uso e apropria\u00e7\u00e3o do espa\u00e7o por parte das \n\ncomunidades humanas e nas rela\u00e7\u00f5es decorrentes entre estas comunidades com esse \n\nespa\u00e7o local de suporte, desta fase inicial em que n\u00e3o existia uma clara distin\u00e7\u00e3o entre o \n\nobjeto desta nova ci\u00eancia e o trabalho realizado pela Geografia Humana ou pela \n\nAntropologia, surgiu a necessidade da transi\u00e7\u00e3o de uma an\u00e1lise centrada no uso e \n\napropria\u00e7\u00e3o do espa\u00e7o, para uma an\u00e1lise sist\u00eamica em que o objeto do estudo passou a \n\nser constitu\u00eddo pelas rela\u00e7\u00f5es que as comunidades humanas estabelecem com o ambiente, \n\ne desta forma consolida-se como campo plurisdisciplinar por excel\u00eancia. \n\nOra, desta evolu\u00e7\u00e3o da an\u00e1lise das rela\u00e7\u00f5es com o \u201cterrit\u00f3rio\u201d, para a an\u00e1lise \n\nsist\u00e9mica dos \u201cprocessos econ\u00f3micos e ecol\u00f3gicos\u201d, sustentamos que o fator estrutural da \n\nafirma\u00e7\u00e3o e autonomiza\u00e7\u00e3o da Ecologia Humana passa pela assun\u00e7\u00e3o de um processo de \n\n\u201cdesterritorializa\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d do objeto de estudo. Tendo em conta que estes processos \n\necol\u00f3gicos s\u00e3o na sua ess\u00eancia globais, a escala de estudo ter\u00e1 de se compatibilizar com \n\na escala dos processos. Como afirma Mcharg (1984:53) \u201cO principal desafio que se \n\ncoloca \u00e0 ecologia humana \u00e9 da capacidade de s\u00edntese dos processos f\u00edsicos, biol\u00f3gicos, \n\nsociais, econ\u00f3micos e culturais para compreender as pessoas os lugares, observar as \n\nrela\u00e7\u00f5es sist\u00e9micas e coment\u00e1-las\u201d. Iva Pires (2011:25) defende mesmo a perspetiva de \n\nque a \u201cEcologia Humana seja pensada como esfor\u00e7o para uma inadi\u00e1vel compatibilidade \n\nentre Socioesfera e Biosfera\u201d. Se o desafio na Ecologia humana for realizado no contexto \n\nda escala das rela\u00e7\u00f5es entre a comunidade global (humanidade) e o meio envolvente (o \n\nplaneta e o sistema terrestre que suporta a vida), independentemente das leituras locais \n\nparciais que possam ser realizadas, esta abordagem poder\u00e1 constituir a grande novidade \n\nque a Ecologia Humana pode trazer ao conhecimento, unificando-o e demarcando-se das \n\nv\u00e1rias \u00e1reas de conhecimento que integra e incorpora. A Ecologia Humana seria assim \n\numa ci\u00eancia que emerge da intera\u00e7\u00e3o de todas as outras \u00e1reas de conhecimento, criando \n\n\n\n 26 \n\numa nova, que como fen\u00f3meno emergente, seria mais do que a mera soma das partes. O \n\ncar\u00e1cter pluridisciplinar da Ecologia Humana fica bem patente na diversidade de \u00e1ras \n\ntem\u00e1ticas das suas publica\u00e7\u00f5es indexadas na base de dados SCOPUS onde cerca de 50% \n\npertencem \u00e0 \u00e1rea das ci\u00eancias sociais e a outra metade est\u00e1 distribu\u00edda pelas ci\u00eancias do \n\nambiente, medicina, ci\u00eancias da terra, ou agricultura, entre as principais (Pires, et al, \n\n2017). \n\nA legitimidade de todo e qualquer conhecimento, como demonstram previamente \n\nCamillieri e Falk (1992), depende do seu poder explicativo para retratar a realidade \n\nconhecida. A aceita\u00e7\u00e3o/afirma\u00e7\u00e3o de uma nova ci\u00eancia, mais do que o resultado de \n\nteoriza\u00e7\u00f5es ou tentativas de explica\u00e7\u00f5es com o intuito de distinguir e afirmar um novo \n\nramo de constru\u00e7\u00e3o de conhecimento, ir\u00e1 depender dessa capacidade de acuradamente \n\ndescrever os factos e explicar da realidade e n\u00e3o de uma discuss\u00e3o centrada nos \n\nprocedimentos e metodologias aplicadas.  \n\nSe o objetivo \u00faltimo ser\u00e1 a pr\u00f3pria unifica\u00e7\u00e3o do conhecimento e a Ecologia Humana \n\nconstitui-se como a ci\u00eancia mais bem posicionada para desempenhar esta tarefa de \n\nconectar as informa\u00e7\u00f5es, talvez seja mesmo necess\u00e1rio assumir a sua n\u00e3o delimita\u00e7\u00e3o, at\u00e9 \n\nporque essa delimita\u00e7\u00e3o seria sempre dependente das evolu\u00e7\u00f5es realizadas pelas outras \n\nci\u00eancias com que interage. Parece-nos que aceita\u00e7\u00e3o desta sua condi\u00e7\u00e3o instrumento de \n\nconex\u00f5es e de constru\u00e7\u00e3o de sentidos, ser\u00e1 mesmo um requisito estrutural para poder \n\nambicionar ser esse sistema de pontes e interconex\u00f5es. Neste sentido, a nova escala de \n\ntrabalho das ci\u00eancias naturais operada pelas ci\u00eancias do Sistema Terrestre, parece-nos ser \n\numa oportunidade \u00fanica para evolu\u00e7\u00e3o das constru\u00e7\u00f5es sociais e para a afirma\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nEcologia Humana, como a ci\u00eancia da vis\u00e3o integradora que avan\u00e7a na constru\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nnovas solu\u00e7\u00f5es em fun\u00e7\u00e3o destes novos conhecimentos. \n\n \u201cA global solution to the sustainability challenge is thus a prerequisite for living \n\nsustainably at local and regional scales (Steffen et.at 2011:6)\u201d. Parece-nos ilus\u00f3ria a \n\nperspetiva de que a soma das atua\u00e7\u00f5es locais, poder\u00e3o resultar numa mudan\u00e7a global. \n\nMesmo as abordagens numa escala mais reduzida dependem sempre da sua \n\ncontextualiza\u00e7\u00e3o numa abordagem global integradora, e essa tarefa estar\u00e1 inscrita no \n\nc\u00f3digo gen\u00e9tico da Ecologia Humana. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 27 \n\n1.5. Uma Ecologia Humana \u00e0 escala da Humanidade \n\n \n\nDepois de um longo percurso de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o emp\u00edrica, Elinor Ostrom publica em \n\n1990 o seu livro seminal \u201cGoverning the Commons\u201d onde explora de forma inovadora \n\nsobre a possibilidade da gest\u00e3o dos bens comuns n\u00e3o terminar fatalmente numa \n\n\u201ctrag\u00e9dia\u201d. Tendo por base centenas de estudos realizados um pouco por todo o mundo, \n\nOstrom demonstrou que a gest\u00e3o partilhada de terras, \u00e1gua, florestas ou pescas, quando \n\nrealizada sob a orienta\u00e7\u00e3o de alguns princ\u00edpios b\u00e1sicos que identificou, pode resultar num \n\nsucesso para todos. A demonstra\u00e7\u00e3o desta possibilidade \u00e9 de enorme import\u00e2ncia e \n\nalcance uma vez que ela destrona a perspetiva de um modelo econ\u00f3mico baseado \n\nexclusivamente nos livres mecanismos de mercado e propriedade privada, como \u00fanica \n\nforma de evitar essa trag\u00e9dia. Esta vis\u00e3o ainda hoje subscrita pela maioria dos \n\neconomistas, foi na sua ess\u00eancia desenhada e popularizada com um famoso artigo escrito \n\npor um bi\u00f3logo, Garret Hardin 1968, intitulado: \"A Trag\u00e9dia dos Bens Comuns\". O \n\nexemplo apresentado, que se tornou j\u00e1 um cl\u00e1ssico, \u00e9 o seguinte: numa situa\u00e7\u00e3o de uso \n\npartilhado de um pasto entre v\u00e1rios pastores, nenhum pastor individual ir\u00e1 ter um \n\nincentivo racional para se auto-limitar no uso do pasto comum. Desta forma, se um dos \n\npastores trouxer uma cabe\u00e7a de gado a mais, os outros pastores ir\u00e3o reagir da mesma \n\nforma, aumentando igualmente o n\u00famero individual de cabe\u00e7as de gado a pastar no \n\nterreno comum e o resultado ser\u00e1 a sobre-explora\u00e7\u00e3o do pasto e a trag\u00e9dia de todos. Esta \n\nlinha de racioc\u00ednio implica que s\u00f3 atrav\u00e9s da divis\u00e3o e atribui\u00e7\u00e3o de propriedade privada \n\nse poder\u00e1 ultrapassar a inevitabilidade da trag\u00e9dia dos comuns, pois apenas as pessoas \n\ncom propriedade privada seriam motivadas a proteger e a auto-limitar o uso das suas \n\npr\u00f3prias terras. O resultado final seria que a soma total destes comportamentos \n\nindividuais iria ser ben\u00e9fica para todos. Acontece que Hardin e todos os seus sucessores \n\ndeturparam o conceito de bens comuns ao considera-lo um regime que apenas pode existir \n\nnum completo livre acesso, que se realiza num cen\u00e1rio de aus\u00eancia de total regras, onde \n\nn\u00e3o h\u00e1 limites para a apropria\u00e7\u00e3o do recurso, nem uma comunidade definida de usu\u00e1rios. \n\n\u201cBut Hardin and others misrepresent the concept of the commons as an open-access \n\nregime, operating in a free-for-all scenario where there are no boundaries to the grazing \n\nland, no rules for managing it, and no community of users. However, a properly managed \n\ncommons has boundaries, rules, monitoring of usage, punishment of free-riders, and \n\n\n\n 28 \n\nsocial norms. A commons requires that, there be a community willing to act as a steward \n\nof a resource (Gautam 2016: 270)\u201d. \n\nO free-for-all scenario, tem constitu\u00eddo a base estrutural que suporta a perspectiva da \n\ninviabilidade da gest\u00e3o de bens comuns, e a inexist\u00eancia de uma alternativa consistente \n\nao modelo de privatiza\u00e7\u00e3o, divis\u00e3o e mecanismos de mercado para evitar a trag\u00e9dia dos \n\nbens comuns. Para al\u00e9m deste erro de base, esta an\u00e1lise dominante, tem igualmente \n\nocultado o facto de existirem bens sobre os quais n\u00e3o \u00e9 poss\u00edvel realizar nenhum tipo de \n\ndivis\u00e3o, nem mesmo abstrata, nomeadamente \u00e0 escala global, onde a trag\u00e9dia dos bens \n\ncomuns globais \u00e9 o sin\u00f3nimo da Suprema Trag\u00e9dia. \n\nNesta escala, para al\u00e9m da abordagem global ao bem, o qual se tornou poss\u00edvel definir \n\na partir do momento em que foi identificado o Safe Operating Space of Humankind, \u00e9 \n\ntamb\u00e9m necess\u00e1rio definir a comunidade de interesses na manuten\u00e7\u00e3o do bem comum, \n\nneste caso o estado favor\u00e1vel do Sistema Terrestre. A constru\u00e7\u00e3o de um modelo de gest\u00e3o \n\ndo uso organizado do Sistema Terrestre pressup\u00f5e a exist\u00eancia de uma comunidade \n\nhumana (o conjunto planet\u00e1rio da Humanidade) internamente organizada, com o objetivo \n\nde agir como protetora do Sistema Terrestre. \n\nComo seres humanos, vivemos simultaneamente em dois tipos diferentes de \n\ncomunidades de interesses: uma ao n\u00edvel das sociedades nacionais e outra ao n\u00edvel da \n\ncomunidade global. Mas, ao contr\u00e1rio das comunidades nacionais organizadas em \n\nterrit\u00f3rios, a comunidade global da humanidade n\u00e3o \u00e9 sujeito de Direito Internacional, \n\numa vez que n\u00e3o tem territ\u00f3rio onde basear uma \u201cexist\u00eancia\u201d organizada como uma \n\nverdadeira comunidade de interesses comuns. O principio da territorialidade condiciona \n\nde forma transversal todas as constru\u00e7\u00f5es sociais humanas e nesta mat\u00e9ria o ponto de \n\npartida a partir do qual a an\u00e1lise tradicional \u00e9 feita \u00e9 que uma comunidade humana \n\norganizada pressup\u00f5e necessariamente a conjuga\u00e7\u00e3o do elemento territ\u00f3rio com o \n\nelemento povo, como suporte origin\u00e1rio de onde deriva e delimita da autoridade do poder \n\npol\u00edtico. \n\nAcontece que \u00e0 escala da comunidade humana global o \"territ\u00f3rio\" da humanidade \u00e9 \n\no planeta, e esse facto ultrapassa o conceito de autoridade e organiza\u00e7\u00e3o exclusivamente \n\nfundada num elemento territorial. A humanidade n\u00e3o possui desta forma um substrato de \n\nlugar do qual derivam consequ\u00eancias jur\u00eddicas, e a partir do qual se possa basear a \n\norganiza\u00e7\u00e3o de comunidade de interesses comuns de longo prazo, distintos e \n\ncomplementares dos interesses de curto-prazo do Estados. O pr\u00f3prio Patrim\u00f3nio da \n\nHumanidade \u00e9 em si uma fic\u00e7\u00e3o jur\u00eddica imprecisa, uma vez que a humanidade n\u00e3o pode \n\n\n\n 29 \n\nser verdadeiramente titular de quaisquer direitos, nem sequer de representa\u00e7\u00e3o, uma vez \n\nque n\u00e3o possui qualquer personalidade jur\u00eddica (nacional ou internacional). Estes \n\nproblemas s\u00e3o vis\u00edveis, por exemplo, na gest\u00e3o internacionalizada dos fundos Marinhos \n\n- a chamada \u00c1rea \u2013 prevista pela Conven\u00e7\u00e3o das Na\u00e7\u00f5es Unidas sobre Direito do Mar \n\n(CNUDM e tamb\u00e9m conhecida por Conven\u00e7\u00e3o de Montego Bay), onde no seu artigo \n\nartigos 136\u00ba, se afirma \u201cA \u00c1rea e seus recursos s\u00e3o Patrim\u00f3nio Comum da Humanidade.\u201d  \n\nEste patrim\u00f3nio comum \u00e9 constitu\u00eddo pelos territ\u00f3rios dos fundos marinhos \n\nremanescentes das jurisdi\u00e7\u00f5es mar\u00edtimas dos estados costeiros, isto \u00e9, todas as \u00e1reas que \n\nficam para al\u00e9m dos limites das zonas econ\u00f3micas exclusivas. A discuss\u00e3o doutrinal sobre \n\nesta quest\u00e3o \u00e9 em si reveladora da fragilidade do conceito jur\u00eddico de Humanidade e da \n\npr\u00f3pria fic\u00e7\u00e3o jur\u00eddica que o pr\u00f3prio Patrim\u00f3nio da Humanidade constitui. A humanidade \n\ncomo conceito biol\u00f3gico n\u00e3o encaixa no modelo dogm\u00e1tico-formal da organiza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nterritorial.  \n\nEmbora para alguns autores, como Sadok Belaid (1982:433-39), a qualifica\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\n\u00c1rea como Patrim\u00f3nio Comum da Humanidade traduza o reconhecimento da \n\ncomunidade humana ou mesmo da humanidade como titular de um direito de propriedade \n\ncoletivo, a grande maioria contraria veementemente esta opini\u00e3o. Este posicionamento \n\nfundamenta-se com argumentos que recaem no facto da comunidade humana ou a \n\nhumanidade n\u00e3o serem sujeitos de direito, isto \u00e9, n\u00e3o s\u00f3 a humanidade n\u00e3o possui \n\npersonalidade jur\u00eddica, sendo desta forma insuscet\u00edvel de ser titular de quaisquer direitos, \n\ncomo no facto da pr\u00f3pria ideia de um direito de propriedade coletiva n\u00e3o parecer \n\nadequada \u00e0 caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o do Patrim\u00f3nio Comum da Humanidade. Em bom rigor, a \n\ncircunst\u00e2ncia dos artigos 136\u00ba\n \n\ne 137\u00ba aparentemente atribu\u00edrem \u00e0 humanidade a \n\ntitularidade de certos direitos, n\u00e3o parece suficiente para concluir a personalidade \n\ninternacional da humanidade e a inerente titularidade das referidas posi\u00e7\u00f5es jur\u00eddicas. Se \n\npara alguns a inexist\u00eancia de normas na CNUDM sobre a quest\u00e3o da personalidade da \n\nHumanidade s\u00f3 pode significar a sua n\u00e3o personifica\u00e7\u00e3o internacional e a inerente \n\ninsusceptibilidade de possuir a titularidade de quaisquer direitos face \u00e0 \u00c1rea, para outros, \n\no que releva \u00e9 a pr\u00e1tica da pr\u00f3pria Autoridade que age em nome e no interesse da \n\nHumanidade, n\u00e3o sendo necess\u00e1rio para tal uma men\u00e7\u00e3o formal expressa de que a \n\npersonalidade lhe tenha sido atribu\u00edda. \n\nA considera\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00c1rea como Patrim\u00f3nio Comum da Humanidade s\u00f3 pode ser \n\nexplicada atrav\u00e9s de uma verdadeira fic\u00e7\u00e3o jur\u00eddica. Na realidade, n\u00e3o \u00e9 a Humanidade \n\nque surge como sujeito de direito internacional, mas sim a Autoridade Internacional dos \n\n\n\n 30 \n\nFundos Marinhos. Consequentemente, s\u00f3 esta pode ser titular de direitos e estar adstrita \n\na obriga\u00e7\u00f5es, ainda que ficcionadamente se diga agir como representante da Humanidade.  \n\nUma certeza, por\u00e9m, existe: o territ\u00f3rio submerso que est\u00e1 sob o regime jur\u00eddico de \n\nPatrim\u00f3nio Comum da Humanidade funciona como substrato territorial de um sujeito de \n\ndireito internacional (A Autoridade) pelo que esta se assume como titular de um \n\nverdadeiro dom\u00ednio p\u00fablico sobre o referido espa\u00e7o. Todavia, a titularidade do citado \n\nespa\u00e7o confere \u00e0 Autoridade, simultaneamente, o \u00f3nus de gerir e explorar os recursos da \n\n\u00c1rea em benef\u00edcio de toda a Humanidade, tendo sempre em vista a sua conserva\u00e7\u00e3o para \n\nas gera\u00e7\u00f5es futuras (Fialho et.al 2009:10).  \n\nPor outro lado, a Humanidade \u00e9 recorrentemente mencionada nos textos dos Tratados \n\nInternacionais, sem, no entanto, ser clara a forma da sua representa\u00e7\u00e3o, exist\u00eancia ou \n\naptid\u00e3o para se constituir como titular de direitos. Ora se existe algum coment\u00e1rio que \n\npossa ser feito quanto \u00e0 quest\u00e3o da Humanidade \u00e9 que a pr\u00f3pria problem\u00e1tica em si \u00e9 \n\nreveladora do paradigma da territorialidade como ponto focal a partir do qual se analisam \n\ntodos os factos do mundo real.  \n\n Isto \u00e9, embora o conjunto humanidade exista de facto, n\u00e3o pode ser titular de direitos, \n\nmas, no entanto, pode nomear representantes para os exercer atrav\u00e9s dos Estados... uma \n\nvez que na \u201c(...) impossibilidade de ser atribu\u00edda a representa\u00e7\u00e3o da Humanidade \n\ndiretamente aos Estados, com a consequente cria\u00e7\u00e3o de uma entidade internacional, por \n\nmeio da qual os Estados organizam e controlam as atividades da \u00c1rea. (Fialho et.al \n\n2009:11)\u201d.  \n\nPerceber o contexto legal existente \u00e9 ent\u00e3o fundamental para perceber a estrutura da \n\natual rela\u00e7\u00e3o Humanidade-Planeta/Sistema Terrestre e as causas estruturais que est\u00e3o na \n\nbase do modelo \u201cn\u00e3o-adaptado\u201d vigente, bem como na inexist\u00eancia da uma comunidade \n\nglobal organizada com o willing to act, conforme mencionado por Gautam, para ser \n\nposs\u00edvel a constru\u00e7\u00e3o de uma a\u00e7\u00e3o coletiva. Este contexto ser\u00e1 ainda um fator \n\ndeterminante para o problema do enquadramento jur\u00eddico das gera\u00e7\u00f5es futuras e os seus \n\npotenciais interesses.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 31 \n\n1.6. Uma Ecologia Humana trans-temporal \n\n \n\n Outra dimens\u00e3o a ter em conta na an\u00e1lise da rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre a comunidade humana e o \n\n/Sistema Terrestre, ser\u00e1 perceber de que forma a organiza\u00e7\u00e3o desta comunidade est\u00e1 \n\nadaptada, ou n\u00e3o, para acautelar os interesses das gera\u00e7\u00f5es futuras. A encruzilhada de \n\ndesafios que se colocam \u00e0 Ecologia Humana na sua afirma\u00e7\u00e3o como ci\u00eancia integradora, \n\nestendem-se muito al\u00e9m do desafio cient\u00edfico de constru\u00e7\u00e3o de uma plataforma de \n\nconhecimento que integra v\u00e1rias disciplinas. Se anteriormente analisamos o desafio da \n\nescala do objeto, no sentido de que \u00e9 inevit\u00e1vel abordar o Sistema Terrestre na sua \n\nglobalidade, e um outro desafio relativo ao sujeito, no sentido de abordar a Humanidade \n\ncomo o conjunto de todos os seres humanos, relativamente a este \u00faltimo teremos ainda \n\nque nos debru\u00e7ar sobre o desafio temporal, no sentido de perceber em que medida o \n\nmodelo de adapta\u00e7\u00e3o pode ou n\u00e3o assegurar um suporte de vida para a continuidade das \n\ngera\u00e7\u00f5es que ainda n\u00e3o nasceram.  \n\nUma vez que os impactos realizados no estado do Sistema Terrestre s\u00e3o cumulativos e \n\na rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre causas e efeitos implicam necessariamente uma proje\u00e7\u00e3o de v\u00ednculos para \n\no futuro, abre-se uma s\u00e9rie de possibilidades distintas de abordagens: a) sob uma \u00f3tica \n\ncr\u00edtica estritamente jur\u00eddica, as rela\u00e7\u00f5es com as futuras gera\u00e7\u00f5es podem ser consideradas \n\nimposs\u00edveis, na medida em que estas ainda n\u00e3o existem, b) sob uma an\u00e1lise econ\u00f3mica, \n\npodem ainda ser desinteressantes, no sentido de nada poderem retribuir aos interesses \n\nmateriais das atuais gera\u00e7\u00f5es, c) podem ainda ser considerados apenas deveres meramente \n\nmorais. Finalmente, tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 poss\u00edvel identificar uma obriga\u00e7\u00e3o de solidariedade com \n\nas gera\u00e7\u00f5es futuras e que ultrapassa a no\u00e7\u00e3o ego\u00edsta e utilitarista das gera\u00e7\u00f5es atuais.  \n\nPara Edith Weiss (1992:5) \u201cThere are two relationships that must shape any theory \n\nof intergenerational equity in the context of our natural environment: our relationship to \n\nother generations of our own species and our relationship to the natural system of which \n\nwe are a part. The human species is integrally linked with other parts of the natural \n\nsystem; we affect and are affected by what happens in the system. We alone among all \n\nliving creatures have the capacity to shape significantly our relationship to the \n\nenvironment.\u201d Esta vis\u00e3o pode ainda ser sustentada no regime legal de Patrim\u00f3nio \n\nComum da Humanidade, como explica Alexandra Arag\u00e3o (1997:31): \u201cDa ideia de \n\nPatrim\u00f3nio Comum da Humanidade, podem-se retirar duas consequ\u00eancias: primeiro, que \n\nsobre estes recursos existe uma esp\u00e9cie de comunh\u00e3o, uma sobreposi\u00e7\u00e3o e um paralelismo \n\n\n\n 32 \n\nde direitos absolutos, cuja finalidade \u00e9 a satisfa\u00e7\u00e3o tanto de interesses coletivos como \n\nindividuais; segundo, que as gera\u00e7\u00f5es atuais os det\u00eam apenas a t\u00edtulo fiduci\u00e1rio. A \n\nresponsabilidade fiduci\u00e1ria das gera\u00e7\u00f5es presentes perante as futuras significa que os \n\nrecursos devem ser deixados \u00e0s futuras gera\u00e7\u00f5es, tal como foram encontrados, \n\npreservando tanto a variedade como a abund\u00e2ncia como ainda a qualidade dos bens\u201d.  \n\nEste dever \u00e9 expresso na teoria da \u201cequidade intergeracional\u201d: \u201cThe second \n\nfundamental relationship is that between different generations of the human species. All \n\ngenerations are inherently linked to other generations, past and future, in using the \n\ncommon patrimony of Earth. The theory of intergenerational equity stipulates that all \n\ngenerations have an equal place in relation to the natural system. There is no basis for \n\npreferring the present generation over future generations in their use of the planet (Weiss \n\n1992:6)\u201d. \n\nApesar deste princ\u00edpio da equidade intergeracional se encontrar j\u00e1 previsto em algumas \n\nConstitui\u00e7\u00f5es, como \u00e9 o caso da Constitui\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira3 onde as gera\u00e7\u00f5es futuras n\u00e3o s\u00e3o \n\ntidas apenas como interessadas, mas antes consideradas verdadeiros titulares de direitos \n\nem rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao desenvolvimento e ao patrim\u00f3nio ambiental, esta \u201cresponsabilidade de \n\nlonga-dura\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d levanta v\u00e1rias dificuldades teor\u00e9tico-dogm\u00e1ticas e jur\u00eddico-dogm\u00e1ticas \n\nno recorte de um sujeito de direitos e de rela\u00e7\u00f5es jur\u00eddicas, nebulosamente identificado \n\ncomo \u201cgera\u00e7\u00f5es futuras\u201d, conforme alerta Gomes Canotilho (2003). Estas dificuldades \n\nlevam alguns autores a acentuar que o que est\u00e1 em causa n\u00e3o ser\u00e1 a titularidade de direitos \n\nfuturos, mas sim a inclus\u00e3o dos interesses das gera\u00e7\u00f5es futuras nos princ\u00edpios materiais \n\nde atua\u00e7\u00e3o pol\u00edtico-constitucionalmente relevantes. Outra corrente da doutrina refere-se \n\na este direito na esteira de reconhecer um direito ao futuro, ou seja, a uma obriga\u00e7\u00e3o \n\njur\u00eddica de prote\u00e7\u00e3o do futuro (Ayala 2004, Freitas, 2012). \n\nNuma l\u00f3gica estritamente formal ser\u00e1 dif\u00edcil recortar uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o jur\u00eddica com o \n\nfuturo, no sentido de ser imposs\u00edvel definir com precis\u00e3o o sujeito dessa rela\u00e7\u00e3o futura. \n\n\u00c9 com base nesta l\u00f3gica de racioc\u00ednio que Wilfred Beckerman (2006) nega a exist\u00eancia \n\nde direitos ou interesses das futuras gera\u00e7\u00f5es, baseando-se em tr\u00eas silogismos: (1) \u00e0s \n\nfuturas gera\u00e7\u00f5es \u2013 de pessoas ainda n\u00e3o nascidas \u2013 n\u00e3o se pode reconhecer quaisquer \n\ndireitos; (2) qualquer teoria de justi\u00e7a coerente implica uma atribui\u00e7\u00e3o de direitos \u00e0s \n\n                                                \n3 Constitui\u00e7\u00e3o da Rep\u00fablica Federativa do Brasil \u2013 Artigo 225\u00ba \u201cTodos t\u00eam direito ao meio ambiente ecologicamente \nequilibrado, bem de uso comum do povo e essencial \u00e0 sadia qualidade de vida, impondo-se ao Poder P\u00fablico e \u00e0 \ncoletividade o dever de defend\u00ea-lo e preserv\u00e1-lo para as presentes e futuras gera\u00e7\u00f5es.\u201d  - Centro de Documenta\u00e7\u00e3o e \ninforma\u00e7\u00e3o, Edi\u00e7\u00f5es C\u00e2mara, Bras\u00edlia, 2012. \n\n\n\n 33 \n\npessoas.

E \u00e9 por esta raz\u00e3o que o problema da justi\u00e7a \n\nintergeracional coloca \u00e0 teoria da \u00e9tica severos sen\u00e3o imposs\u00edveis testes. \n\nAntonio Benjamin (2011) alerta ainda para o facto de as futuras gera\u00e7\u00f5es n\u00e3o poderem \n\nestar fisicamente presentes nos debates legislativos do presente, bem como os milh\u00f5es de \n\nesp\u00e9cies existentes no planeta, muitas das quais nem sequer s\u00e3o conhecidas pela Ci\u00eancia. \n\nNo entanto, mesmo reconhecendo a verdade destes factos, tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o podemos negar a \n\ncerteza de que as gera\u00e7\u00f5es futuras possuir\u00e3o exist\u00eancia em determinado momento \n\nhist\u00f3rico, a n\u00e3o ser que a vida neste planeta fosse extinta de uma \u00fanica vez, situa\u00e7\u00e3o na \n\nqual n\u00e3o restaria oportunidade para algu\u00e9m beneficiar da heran\u00e7a cultural ou dos recursos \n\nplanet\u00e1rios. Como essa possibilidade n\u00e3o se coloca para j\u00e1, h\u00e1 que ultrapassar o paradoxo, \n\ncomo afirma (Weiss 1992:14): \u201cThis paradox assumes the traditional conceptual \n\nframework of rights as rights of identifiable individuals. But planetary intergenerational \n\nrights are not in the first instance rights possessed by individuals. They are, instead, \n\n\n\n 34 \n\ngenerational rights, which must be conceived of in the temporal context of generations. \n\nGenerations hold these rights as groups in relation to other generations - past, present, \n\nand future. This is consistent with other approaches to rights, including the Islamic \n\napproach, which treats human rights not only as individual rights, but as \"rights of the \n\ncommunity of believers as a whole.\u201d They can be evaluated by objective criteria and \n\nindices applied to the planet from one generation to the next. To evaluate whether the \n\ninterests represented in planetary rights are being adequately protected does not depend \n\nupon knowing the number of kinds of individuals that may ultimately exist in any given \n\nfuture generation.\u201d \n\nEste racioc\u00ednio parte de um pressuposto fundamental, o de se reconhecer sen\u00e3o a \n\nexist\u00eancia das gera\u00e7\u00f5es futuras, a certeza de que possuir\u00e3o exist\u00eancia em determinado \n\nmomento hist\u00f3rico. Seja esse facto visto como mera expectativa, seja como futuro \n\nnaturalmente previs\u00edvel. Helena Melo (2002:156), entende que v\u00e1rios sentidos t\u00eam sido \n\natribu\u00eddos \u00e0 express\u00e3o gera\u00e7\u00f5es futuras, quer abrangendo as crian\u00e7as j\u00e1 nascidas, quer \n\nabrangendo apenas os indiv\u00edduos, quer abrangendo apenas os indiv\u00edduos que nascer\u00e3o \n\nnum futuro mais ou menos remoto. Se partirmos do conceito de gera\u00e7\u00e3o como \u201co conjunto \n\ndos indiv\u00edduos nascidos mais ou mesmo tempo (Malhotra 1998:41), cobrindo cada \n\ngera\u00e7\u00e3o um per\u00edodo de aproximadamente vinte e cinco anos, tal significa que nesta \n\nabordagem n\u00e3o existe uma clara demarca\u00e7\u00e3o entre uma gera\u00e7\u00e3o e a gera\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nimediatamente a seguir ou anterior. H\u00e1, antes pelo contr\u00e1rio, um continuum de gera\u00e7\u00f5es, \n\nque se sucedem e sobrep\u00f5em no tempo. Ainda segundo Malhotra (1998:41) \u201cDe acordo \n\ncom esta ace\u00e7\u00e3o, os indiv\u00edduos futuros s\u00e3o indiv\u00edduos que ainda n\u00e3o existem, sendo \n\nimposs\u00edvel determinar com exatid\u00e3o quem e quantos ser\u00e3o.

Cada gera\u00e7\u00e3o ser\u00e1 deste modo \u201cum elo \n\nnuma cadeia sem fim de gera\u00e7\u00f5es que coletivamente forma uma comunidade, a Fam\u00edlia \n\nda Humanidade\u201d (Agius 1998:7). \n\n\n\n 35 \n\nAparece deste modo, o conceito de Humanidade como uma comunidade \n\nintergeracional, que inclui as gera\u00e7\u00f5es passadas, presentes e futuras, como uma \n\n\u201ccomunidade de seres que olham para tr\u00e1s e para a frente, que interpreta o passado \u00e0 luz \n\ndo presente, que v\u00ea o futuro como nascido do passado\u201d (Agiu, Kim 1998:15). Se o Direito \n\nainda busca um caminho que torne poss\u00edvel enquadrar juridicamente uma comunidade \n\nque existe no interior de todas as fronteiras e \u00e9 global, as ci\u00eancias naturais j\u00e1 encontraram \n\no fundamento da unidade biol\u00f3gica da exist\u00eancia real e factual desta comunidade global: \n\n\u201ctoda a pessoa, quer viva hoje ou no futuro, se encontra relacionada gen\u00e9tica e \n\nculturalmente com o resto da comunidade da ra\u00e7a humana\u201d (Santos 2001:68). A \n\nHumanidade pode assim significar a \u201ctotalidade do g\u00e9nero humano, o conjunto de todos \n\nos seres humanos que habitam o planeta\u201d (Santos 2001:68) ao longo das sucessivas \n\ngera\u00e7\u00f5es. \u00c9 tamb\u00e9m chegada a hora de fazer coincidir estas realidades naturais com a \n\nrealidade constru\u00edda, que reconhecendo igualmente a factualidade da exist\u00eancia de povos \n\npoliticamente organizados num determinado territ\u00f3rio juridicamente delimitado, n\u00e3o \n\nimpliquem necessariamente a oculta\u00e7\u00e3o e nega\u00e7\u00e3o da exist\u00eancia de uma comunidade \n\nhumana global geneticamente e temporalmente ligada.  \n\nMas apesar do contributo positivo na defini\u00e7\u00e3o de Humanidade suscitada pela \n\nevolu\u00e7\u00e3o das ci\u00eancias da vida e pela descodifica\u00e7\u00e3o do genoma humano, os problemas do \n\nrecorte de um sujeito de direitos e de rela\u00e7\u00f5es jur\u00eddicas futuras, mant\u00eam-se. E \u00e9 \n\nexatamente ao fugir de conceitos metaf\u00edsicos, que John Ralws (2008), conforme j\u00e1 visto, \n\nretoma a discuss\u00e3o do futuro num verdadeiro marco te\u00f3rico sobre a responsabilidade \n\nintergeracional. Trata-se de uma teoria que busca o descolamento de qualquer v\u00ednculo \n\njur\u00eddico com o futuro de uma vis\u00e3o metaf\u00edsica sobre o mesmo, apoiando-se na no\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ninteresses enquanto fatores decisivos para a a\u00e7\u00e3o, e a racionalidade como crit\u00e9rio de \n\njusti\u00e7a. Parte-se assim de um pressuposto temporal elementar, qual seja, o de centrar o \n\nfoco no presente e no raio de a\u00e7\u00e3o das gera\u00e7\u00f5es vivas, ainda que para gerar efeitos para \n\nas futuras gera\u00e7\u00f5es. Na verdade, como refere Fensterseifer, (2014) as gera\u00e7\u00f5es futuras \n\nnada podem fazer hoje para preservar o ambiente de que v\u00e3o usufruir, raz\u00e3o pela qual \n\ntoda a responsabilidade (e deveres correspondentes) de preserva\u00e7\u00e3o da vida e da \n\nqualidade ambiental para o futuro recai sobre as gera\u00e7\u00f5es presentes. \n\n\u00c9 neste contexto, com base no princ\u00edpio da solidariedade intergeracional, em que as \n\nresponsabilidades das gera\u00e7\u00f5es humanas presentes respondem perante um crit\u00e9rio de \n\njusti\u00e7a intergeracional, ou seja, entre gera\u00e7\u00f5es humanas distintas, que iremos procurar \n\n\n\n 36 \n\nencontrar um espa\u00e7o em que a Ecologia Humana possa servir como uma plataforma de \n\nsolu\u00e7\u00f5es. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.7.

Entre os fatores decisivos est\u00e3o o grande aumento na \n\npopula\u00e7\u00e3o humana, produ\u00e7\u00e3o de metano pelo gado, pesca, o uso de \u00e1gua, altera\u00e7\u00f5es no \n\nuso da terra, a queima de combust\u00edveis f\u00f3sseis e as emiss\u00f5es de CO2, os pl\u00e1sticos e os \n\nfertilizantes \u00e0 base de azoto, est\u00e3o entre as atividades humanas que contribuem para, entre \n\noutras coisas, as altera\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas, a acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos oceanos e a extin\u00e7\u00e3o de grande \n\nn\u00famero de esp\u00e9cies, a chamada sexta extin\u00e7\u00e3o. A totalidade dessas atividades humanas \n\ncontribu\u00edram para o advento do Antropoceno e s\u00e3o j\u00e1 rastre\u00e1veis nos estratos geol\u00f3gicos \n\nda Terra. \n\nOs motivos que est\u00e3o na origem da rutura das condi\u00e7\u00f5es favor\u00e1veis e da consequente \n\nmudan\u00e7a para uma nova \u00e9poca geol\u00f3gica est\u00e3o profundamente enraizados num direito \n\ninternacional completamente inadaptado para lidar com a dimens\u00e3o global dos bens \n\ncomuns. As causas estruturais desta disfuncionalidade jur\u00eddica s\u00e3o, em nosso entender, \n\nessencialmente duas: a) manuten\u00e7\u00e3o de uma abordagem estritamente territorialista, em \n\nque os bens comuns globais s\u00e3o apenas os territ\u00f3rios sobrantes das divis\u00f5es pol\u00edticas entre \n\nos Estados, b) manuten\u00e7\u00e3o de um direito econ\u00f3mico internacional que considera como \n\n\u201cexternalidades\u201d (positivas ou negativas) as altera\u00e7\u00f5es provocadas nos ciclos \n\nbiogeof\u00edsicos globais. De referir, que embora numa primeira an\u00e1lise estas causas \n\naparentem uma aus\u00eancia de rela\u00e7\u00e3o, a considera\u00e7\u00e3o destes fatores vitais como \n\n\u201cexternalidades\u201d encontra a sua raz\u00e3o de ser na abordagem territorialista: porque estes \n\nelementos n\u00e3o-territoriais s\u00f3 podem ser considerados \u201cexternos\u201d ao territ\u00f3rio dos Estados, \n\n\n\n 37 \n\nestes ciclos biogeof\u00edsicos s\u00e3o juridicamente irrelevantes e, como resultado desta \n\nirrelev\u00e2ncia s\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m economicamente invis\u00edveis.   \n\nOs resultados desta inadapta\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o uma inexor\u00e1vel caminhada para a trag\u00e9dia dos \n\nciclos biogeof\u00edsicos globais, que por sua vez ir\u00e3o dar origem \u00e0 trag\u00e9dia dos territ\u00f3rios, da \n\norganiza\u00e7\u00e3o social e das funda\u00e7\u00f5es da vida - a Trag\u00e9dia Suprema. A considera\u00e7\u00e3o de que \n\nos fatores que afetam os ciclos biogeof\u00edsicos globais s\u00e3o \u201cexternalidades\u201d relativamente \n\naos Estados, e de que tudo o que \u00e9 global ou trans-temporal, ou \u00e9 invis\u00edvel ou \n\ntecnicamente imposs\u00edvel, s\u00e3o os bloqueios dogm\u00e1ticos que impedem a mudan\u00e7a \n\nestrutural como \u00fanica possibilidade de encontrar um conceito que nos permita uma \n\nsolu\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n\nPara ultrapassar este bloqueio, para gerir estes desafios de evolu\u00e7\u00e3o e mudan\u00e7a, \n\nprecisamos de maneiras efetivas de tomar decis\u00f5es coletivas e de longo prazo que tenham \n\nem considera\u00e7\u00e3o a sobreposi\u00e7\u00e3o destes ciclos biogeof\u00edsicos que existem no interior e \n\nexterior de todos os Estados, e os interesses de todos os afetados incluindo os interesses \n\ndas futuras gera\u00e7\u00f5es. O sistema implementado para gerir estas quest\u00f5es globais - \n\nincluindo a ONU e as organiza\u00e7\u00f5es conectadas com as Na\u00e7\u00f5es Unidas - est\u00e1, na sua forma \n\natual, ref\u00e9m do sistema estado-c\u00eantrico, sem uma defini\u00e7\u00e3o e delimita\u00e7\u00e3o clara dessa \n\ntarefa comum de assegurar a manuten\u00e7\u00e3o do Sistema Terrestre como um todo, de forma \n\naut\u00f3noma e complementar aos interesses individuais dos Estados. Hoje, estes desafios da \n\ninterdepend\u00eancia s\u00e3o respondidos com o recurso a ferramentas de ontem - negocia\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nmultilaterais que s\u00e3o suscet\u00edveis a interesses nacionais de curto prazo. Como \n\nconsequ\u00eancia, as a\u00e7\u00f5es necess\u00e1rias n\u00e3o s\u00e3o tomadas ou s\u00e3o tomadas muito tarde, \n\nenquanto os problemas e os riscos continuam a crescer.  \n\nComo Afirma Anthony Giddens (1999:18), \u201cEstamos a ser empurrados para uma \n\nordem global, que devido \u00e0 sua escala e total interdepend\u00eancia, nem sequer a \n\nconseguimos compreender ou explicar, mas cujos os efeitos se fazem j\u00e1 sentir. Mas \n\nningu\u00e9m que pretenda progredir neste final de s\u00e9culo pode ignorar esta realidade (...). O \n\nS\u00e9culo XXI ser\u00e1 o campo de batalha em que o fundamentalismo se vai defrontar com a \n\ntoler\u00e2ncia cosmopolita.\u201d Esta nova ordem global, \u00e9 ainda uma desordem. Ainda n\u00e3o \u00e9 \n\nconduzida por uma vontade humana coletiva, mas antes emerge de forma an\u00e1rquica, ao \n\nacaso, movida por uma mistura de influ\u00eancias. Nesta desordem florescem os \n\nnacionalismos, os populismos locais como resposta \u00e0s tend\u00eancias globalizantes \n\ndesreguladas, e que tornam os velhos Estados-Na\u00e7\u00e3o mais fracos, na ilus\u00e3o de que se \n\nafirmarem a sua independ\u00eancia fechando as fronteiras, se tornam mais fortes. A \n\n\n\n 38 \n\npossibilidade de sairmos deste ciclo fatal compete em primeiro lugar ao direito, na sua \n\ndimens\u00e3o de estrutura organizadora e harmonizadora destas tens\u00f5es e n\u00e3o no seu papel \n\nsancionat\u00f3rio. Ainda na esteira de Giddens (1999:24), \u201cAssim, h\u00e1 que admitir que a \n\nglobaliza\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o \u00e9 um processo simples, \u00e9 uma rede complexa de processos. E estes \n\noperam de forma contradit\u00f3ria ou em oposi\u00e7\u00e3o aberta. Para a maioria das pessoas, a \n\nglobaliza\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 apenas uma \u201ctroca\u201d de poder ou de influ\u00eancia, das comunidades locais ou \n\ndas na\u00e7\u00f5es para a arena global. (...) Precisamos de reconstruir as institui\u00e7\u00f5es que temos, \n\nou substituir por outras. Porque a globaliza\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o \u00e9 um incidente passageiro nas nossas \n\nvidas. \u00c9 uma mudan\u00e7a das pr\u00f3prias circunst\u00e2ncias em que vivemos. Para superar esses \n\ndesafios, teremos que repensar a natureza fragmentada do sistema jur\u00eddico internacional\u201d. \n\nNeste sentido a organiza\u00e7\u00e3o destes interesses comuns necessita de uma autonomiza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nque permita a sua gest\u00e3o permanente por uma entidade independente que aja em nome e \n\nno interesse de todos, e onde todos estejam devidamente representados. \n\nNo contexto das rela\u00e7\u00f5es dominantes entre Estados, ainda \u00e9 vis\u00edvel que em alguns \n\ndos mecanismos comerciais que fazem parte dos acordos ambientais multilaterais \n\n(MEAs), demonstram igualmente que o quadro subjacente das rela\u00e7\u00f5es est\u00e1 ainda \n\nintimamente ligado ao legado colonial do direito internacional. Com o advento da \n\ninterdepend\u00eancia e do Antropoceno, sabemos hoje que a exporta\u00e7\u00e3o de problemas \n\nambientais do \"n\u00facleo\" para a \"periferia\", dos estados desenvolvidos para os pa\u00edses em \n\ndesenvolvimento, n\u00e3o \u00e9 apenas moralmente censur\u00e1vel, como conduz ao mesmo \n\nresultado. Por outras palavras, perceber o Antropoceno \u00e9 interiorizar a globalidade, a \n\ninterdepend\u00eancia e ser capaz de pensar sem fronteiras, percebendo que a origem ou \n\nlocaliza\u00e7\u00e3o da atividade humana danosa serve apenas como informa\u00e7\u00e3o para a constru\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde um sistema de organiza\u00e7\u00e3o da justi\u00e7a interna, mas que \u00e9 irrelevante na escala global. \n\nEsta impossibilidade de \u201cexportar\u201d atividades que provocam danos ou de armazenar \n\nbenef\u00edcios, suscitadas pelas interconex\u00f5es ecol\u00f3gicas e que resultam em \n\ninterdepend\u00eancias pol\u00edticas e econ\u00f3micas, s\u00e3o os sinais exteriores de algo que nunca \n\nexistiu antes: uma sociedade cosmopolita global. Somos a primeira gera\u00e7\u00e3o a viver numa \n\nsociedade, cujos contornos ainda mal conseguimos vislumbrar, e para qual n\u00e3o existe \n\nainda um sistema de organiza\u00e7\u00e3o nem \u00e0 escala da comunidade humana, nem \u00e0 escala do \n\nfuncionamento global do Sistema Terrestre.  \n\nComo se afirma no relat\u00f3rio Global Commons in the Anthropocene, \u201cThe \n\nAnthropocene is the defining concept of our age. The most significant implication for life \n\nin the Anthropocene is the urgent need to shift to a new worldview that encompasses the \n\n\n\n 39 \n\nidea of planetary stewardship for the Global Commons, thereby delivering global \n\nbenefits. Effective planetary stewardship can be defined as the sum total of societal and \n\nindividual activities that generate long-lasting prosperity for all and enhance the \n\nresilience of the Earth system. To achieve this aim will require a shift in worldviews at \n\nall scales, from local community to nation and from regional to global\u201d (Nakicenovic,N. \n\net.al 2016,32-33).  \n\nA  nova era do Antropoceno significa uma nova vis\u00e3o do mundo, onde o pensamento \n\nem silos desaparece, onde o pensamento global enquadra e orienta as a\u00e7\u00f5es locais, onde \n\nas fronteiras s\u00e3o encaradas apenas como um n\u00edvel necess\u00e1rio da organiza\u00e7\u00e3o social que \n\nn\u00e3o \u00e9 confund\u00edvel com a realidade global ambiental, onde os fen\u00f3menos ambientais e os \n\nfen\u00f3menos sociais se percecionam como interdependentes, encaixa com miss\u00e3o da \n\nEcologia Humana como ci\u00eancia que, pela sua especificidade, pode dar um contributo \n\nrelevante para essa nova forma de olhar o mundo (Pires 2014). O seu grande objetivo \n\npretende ser uma contribui\u00e7\u00e3o para a constru\u00e7\u00e3o de uma vis\u00e3o antri-fragment\u00e1ria do \n\nmundo unindo e dando sentido \u00e0 contribui\u00e7\u00e3o das ci\u00eancias especializadas (Steiner e \n\nNarkus, 2003), procurando conex\u00f5es entre os saberes que de outra forma ficariam \n\nsegregados (Borden, 2014). \n\nS\u00f3 partindo de uma vis\u00e3o global, onde o contacto e intera\u00e7\u00e3o entre as ci\u00eancias naturais \n\ne as ci\u00eancias sociais \u00e9 fundamental, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel construir uma media\u00e7\u00e3o entre as \n\ncapacidades da t\u00e9cnica, o Sistema Terrestre, as nossas inten\u00e7\u00f5es e as organiza\u00e7\u00f5es que as \n\nsustentam. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 40 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCap\u00edtulo 2 \n\n A Natureza Intang\u00edvel \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\u201cNunca conseguiremos ser donos da nossa pr\u00f3pria hist\u00f3ria, mas \u00e9 obrigat\u00f3rio que \nencontremos os meios, e temos capacidade para isso, de colocar este nosso mundo \n\n\u201cdesvairado\u201d no rumo certo. (Giddens 1999 p.18) \n \n \n \n\n \n\n2.1. O Patrim\u00f3nio Intang\u00edvel como o fio de Ariadne do Antropoceno \n\n \n\nComo explicado anteriormente, a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o da \u201cterritorial obsession\u201d (Taylor \n\n2016:112) como modelo exclusivo da organiza\u00e7\u00e3o social, \u00e9 uma narrativa \n\nmanifestamente incompleta e limitadora n\u00e3o s\u00f3 no contexto da complexidade ambiental \n\nexistente, bem como na diversidade das sociedades de hoje. Este modelo territorialista \n\nque oculta tudo que interliga, interfere e \u00e9 global, tem tido como resultado a abertura de \n\num espa\u00e7o de livre arb\u00edtrio, que marginaliza a pr\u00f3pria autoridade do Estado. Isto acontece \n\nnos mais variados n\u00edveis, exigindo uma evolu\u00e7\u00e3o para uma multi-level governance, que \n\nvai muito al\u00e9m da governan\u00e7a espacial do territ\u00f3rio. Neste contexto, a par com a quest\u00e3o \n\nambiental, a \u00e1rea que mais se tem destacado pela sua influ\u00eancia e pelo seu poder efetivo, \n\n\u00e9 o da globaliza\u00e7\u00e3o financeira. Woodward (2005:46), no seu artigo \u201cterritorial trap\u201d \n\nafirma: \u201cTherefore spaces of places models alone are not sound basis for the development \n\n\n\n 41 \n\nof a generalizable framework of multi-level governance. Space of places models need to \n\nbe complemented by an analysis of non-state spheres of authority understood as \u201cspaces \n\nof flows\u201d (Choen1998). The spaces of flows perspective recognizes that some spheres of \n\nauthority are deterritorialized meaning that they derive their power and authority from, \n\nand exercise their power and authority over, functional or social as opposed territorial \n\nspaces. The strength of this approach is its appreciation of sites and structures of \n\ngovernance that cut across, exist within and cascade through territorial levels. The \n\nproblem is that the spaces of flows blueprint ignores or marginalizes structures of power \n\nand authority grounded in territorial space, so, like space of places model, it represents \n\nan incomplete narrative on contemporary financial governance. Cohen\u2019s (1998) solution \n\nto this dilemma is to introduce a fresh concept, \u201cthe authoritative domains\u201d, that \n\nrecognizes, reconciles and synthesizes territorial and non-territorial elements of power \n\nand authority\u2019s territorial and non-territorial elements of power and authority into a single \n\noverarching governance condominium.\u201d \n\nA n\u00edvel ambiental a oculta\u00e7\u00e3o social das conex\u00f5es globais e a inexist\u00eancia de uma \n\ngoverna\u00e7\u00e3o efetiva dos elementos n\u00e3o-territoriais constitu\u00eddos pelos ciclos biogeof\u00edsicos \n\nglobais (para os quais as atuais tentativas de governa\u00e7\u00e3o multilateral, t\u00eam sido \n\nmanifestamente insuficientes) exigem igualmente uma governa\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o-territorial.  \n\nNeste sentido, a governa\u00e7\u00e3o do Antropoceno requer esta abordagem multi-escala, \n\nonde a governa\u00e7\u00e3o dos interesses globais e comuns a toda a humanidade, presente e \n\nfutura, coexiste com a governa\u00e7\u00e3o territorial. E n\u00e3o deixa ser interessante o facto de o \n\nmodelo proposto para uma governa\u00e7\u00e3o financeira da globaliza\u00e7\u00e3o ser o condom\u00ednio, \n\ncomo o \u00fanico modelo jur\u00eddico capaz de comportar uma governa\u00e7\u00e3o multi-level. Estas \n\nsolu\u00e7\u00f5es de coexist\u00eancia apontam para o facto de que o que est\u00e1 em causa n\u00e3o \u00e9 o \u201cfim-\n\ndo-Estado\u201d territorial, mas sim, a sua inevit\u00e1vel evolu\u00e7\u00e3o. O principal obst\u00e1culo a \n\nultrapassar \u00e9 precisamente o atual modelo da \u201cobsess\u00e3o territorial\u201d como solu\u00e7\u00e3o \u00fanica \n\nde governa\u00e7\u00e3o. Se partirmos da inevit\u00e1vel factualidade do funcionamento global do \n\nSistema Terrestre para a procura de solu\u00e7\u00f5es, percebemos que o reenquadramento destas \n\nbarreiras conceptuais jur\u00eddicas \u00e9 poss\u00edvel, e essa \u00e9 uma condi\u00e7\u00e3o pr\u00e9via estrutural para a \n\nconstru\u00e7\u00e3o de um modelo de organiza\u00e7\u00e3o social adaptado ao funcionamento planeta \u2013 \n\nisto \u00e9, \u00e9 um passo primordial para realiza\u00e7\u00e3o do pr\u00f3prio objetivo da Ecologia Humana.  \n\nA Ecologia Humana, ao colocar a comunidade humana no seio do ecossistema \n\nglobal \u2013 o Sistema Terrestre \u2013 est\u00e1 a confrontar-se com uma s\u00e9rie de paradigmas sociais \n\nconsolidados ao longo da hist\u00f3ria da humanidade. A sua vis\u00e3o hol\u00edstica \u00e9 em primeiro \n\n\n\n 42 \n\nlugar altamente desafiante para o sistema jur\u00eddico, como esquema regulador das rela\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nentre indiv\u00edduos, Estados e comunidades. Neste sentido, a ecologia humana na sua fun\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde s\u00edntese dialogante, dever\u00e1 ter como parceiros estrat\u00e9gicos as ci\u00eancias do Sistema \n\nTerrestre e as ci\u00eancias jur\u00eddicas, os quais v\u00e3o ser essenciais para realizar o trabalho de \n\nenquadramento te\u00f3rico pr\u00e9vio, na constru\u00e7\u00e3o de uma sociedade adaptada ao \n\nfuncionamento do Sistema Terrestre.  \n\n \n\n2.2. Organizar a frui\u00e7\u00e3o coletiva \n\n \n\nEmbora recente na escala temporal das ci\u00eancias jur\u00eddicas, o direito do ambiente, \n\npela sua capacidade de intervir em todas as \u00e1reas do agir humano, desde cedo, quer no \n\nprocesso da sua conceptualiza\u00e7\u00e3o, quer no processo da sua aplica\u00e7\u00e3o, revelou-se \n\nsubversivo e complexo. O car\u00e1cter difuso e indeterminado do seu objeto, a \n\nimpossibilidade de o conter no interior de uma fronteira administrativa ou pol\u00edtica, \n\nlevantou problemas de harmoniza\u00e7\u00e3o com os restantes ordenamentos jur\u00eddicos internos \n\nou internacionais, sobrepondo as dimens\u00f5es locais e globais com as estruturas jur\u00eddico-\n\ndogm\u00e1ticas estabelecidas.  \n\nEste desajustamento entre o novo direito e o direito pr\u00e9-existente deve-se em grande \n\nmedida a esta sobreposi\u00e7\u00e3o de diferentes tipos de rela\u00e7\u00f5es humanas em diferentes escalas, \n\nem que algumas das quais podem ser em parte enquadradas no n\u00edvel local do Estado, mas \n\ncujos os efeitos s\u00e3o em grande parte dispersos numa escala global. Isto \u00e9, enquanto a \n\ndimens\u00e3o do micro-bem ambiental gera rela\u00e7\u00f5es t\u00edpicas do Direito P\u00fablico ou do Direito \n\nPrivado nos termos tradicionais para o Direito, a dimens\u00e3o do macro-bem ambiental \u2013 o \n\nSistema Terrestre \u2013 deveria gerar um novo tipo de rela\u00e7\u00e3o jur\u00eddica, de natureza global, e \n\npara a qual n\u00e3o existe um suporte legal nem locus que lhe possa conferir um \n\nenquadramento jur\u00eddico.  \n\nEsta incompatibilidade sist\u00e9mica entre funcionamento do Sistema Terrestre e modelo \n\nde divis\u00e3o territorial existente, n\u00e3o se ficou apenas ao n\u00edvel do espa\u00e7o geogr\u00e1fico. \n\nAprofundando a disfuncionalidade entre modelos, a crise ambiental questiona ainda n\u00e3o \n\ns\u00f3 o modelo econ\u00f3mico quanto ao objetivo do crescimento ilimitado, como ainda levanta \n\na quest\u00e3o da absoluta da necessidade de desenvolver um modelo de prossecu\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ninteresses comuns. Ora estas caracter\u00edsticas s\u00e3o altamente desafiadoras para o modelo \n\necon\u00f3mico existente, onde a solu\u00e7\u00e3o para a harmoniza\u00e7\u00e3o entre interesses coletivos e \n\n\n\n 43 \n\ninteresses privados nos \u00e9 apresentada atrav\u00e9s da considera\u00e7\u00e3o de que a soma da \n\nprossecu\u00e7\u00e3o dos interesses individuais representar\u00e1 a melhor forma da prossecu\u00e7\u00e3o dos \n\ninteresses comuns. \u00c9 neste contexto que o \u201cbem ambiente\u201d surge, e que sendo um bem \n\nglobal indivis\u00edvel e inapropri\u00e1vel (embora o seu estado possa ser alterado pelo uso), n\u00e3o \n\nse presta a uma frui\u00e7\u00e3o de troca e aliena\u00e7\u00e3o, mas sim a uma fun\u00e7\u00e3o de frui\u00e7\u00e3o coletiva \n\n(Cola\u00e7o Antunes 1998). Isto \u00e9, a tarefa de organizar a frui\u00e7\u00e3o do ambiente, neste caso o \n\nmacro-bem Sistema Terrestre, n\u00e3o pode ser realizada numa l\u00f3gica de divis\u00e3o, propriedade \n\nprivada e mecanismos de mercado desregulados.  \n\nOra, conscientes desta impossibilidade na escala do Sistema Terrestre, um dos \n\ndesafios mais importantes do Antropoceno ser\u00e1 o de anular a ant\u00edtese existente entre os \n\ndois nos modelos de governan\u00e7a de bens comuns: a solu\u00e7\u00e3o cl\u00e1ssica de Garret Hardin \u2013 \n\ndivis\u00e3o, direitos de propriedade e mecanismos de mercado para evitar a \"Trag\u00e9dia dos \n\nComuns\" - e a abordagem de Elinor Ostrom que estabelece as condi\u00e7\u00f5es estruturais \n\nnecess\u00e1rias para que gest\u00e3o coletiva seja poss\u00edvel,  resultando em vantagens m\u00fatuas para \n\ntodas os participantes no m\u00e9dio prazo.  \n\n\u00c0 escala de nosso verdadeiro Global Common -  o Sistema da Terrestre \u2013 a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nisolada de uma destas solu\u00e7\u00f5es, n\u00e3o \u00e9 capaz de retratar com precis\u00e3o todos os factos: \n\n  \n\na) As fronteiras pol\u00edticas das soberanias constituem o suporte estrutural da \n\norganiza\u00e7\u00e3o social. Neste n\u00edvel, a solu\u00e7\u00e3o de divis\u00e3o de Hardin, parece \n\npermanecer v\u00e1lida sem nenhuma alternativa vis\u00edvel. \n\n \n\nMas por outro lado\u2026 \n \n\nb) O estado favor\u00e1vel do Sistema Terrestre \u00e9 um bem intang\u00edvel global, no qual n\u00e3o \n\n\u00e9 poss\u00edvel realizar nenhuma opera\u00e7\u00e3o de divis\u00e3o, nem mesmo abstrata. Neste \n\ncontexto, os princ\u00edpios identificados por Ostrom para a gest\u00e3o bem-sucedida dos \n\nbens comuns, podem vir a ser um contributo de excecional relev\u00e2ncia para a \n\nconstru\u00e7\u00e3o de um modelo capaz de assegurar a preserva\u00e7\u00e3o do estado favor\u00e1vel \n\ncomo uma heran\u00e7a que deve ser mantida para usufruto das pr\u00f3ximas gera\u00e7\u00f5es. \n\n \n\nEnt\u00e3o o desafio que se coloca ao Direito \u00e9 em grande medida o da constru\u00e7\u00e3o das \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es estruturais necess\u00e1rias para tornar poss\u00edvel esta frui\u00e7\u00e3o coletiva de um bem que \n\nn\u00e3o \u00e9 suscet\u00edvel de apropria\u00e7\u00e3o ou divis\u00e3o, e ao mesmo tempo assegurar a manuten\u00e7\u00e3o \n\n\n\n 44 \n\nda divis\u00e3o pol\u00edtica territorial. S\u00f3 depois desta organiza\u00e7\u00e3o estar realizada, \u00e0 escala do bem \n\nem causa - o Sistema Terrestre \u2013 ser\u00e1 poss\u00edvel que o direito do ambiente se torna efetivo \n\n\u2013 isto \u00e9 que abandone o seu deficit sist\u00e9mico de aplica\u00e7\u00e3o. Esta desvincula\u00e7\u00e3o da vertente \n\nproprietarista individual, e a assun\u00e7\u00e3o da inevitabilidade da abordagem do ambiente como \n\n\u201cbem comum\u201d, insuscet\u00edvel de divis\u00e3o ou de qualquer forma de apropria\u00e7\u00e3o individual, \n\nir\u00e1 constituir o grande desafio da constru\u00e7\u00e3o de um modelo social para o Antropoceno. \n\nPara Amado Gomes (2005:24), \u201cO ambiente \u00e9 um bem de uma comunidade e a sua \n\ndimens\u00e3o coletiva n\u00e3o pode ser perdida de vista. O direito subjetivo indicia uma posi\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nego\u00edstica, longe da perspetiva solidarista que deve presidir \u00e0 gest\u00e3o dos bens ambientais. \n\nPor isso consideramos que a melhor doutrina \u00e9 aquela que v\u00ea no direito ao ambiente um \n\ndireito-dever de utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o racional dos bens ambientais.(...) O direito ao ambiente, \n\nconstitui desta feita, um bom exemplo de um novo tipo de direitos fundamentais, \n\nverdadeiros \u201cdireitos de solidariedade\u201d, \u201cdireitos poligonais\u201d ou \u201cdireitos circulares\u201d cujo \n\nconte\u00fado \u00e9 definido pelo interesse comum,(...)\u201d. Ora esta organiza\u00e7\u00e3o implica uma \n\nan\u00e1lise das rela\u00e7\u00f5es cruzadas e n\u00e3o raras vezes opostas, que se exercem sobre este bem \n\nde frui\u00e7\u00e3o coletiva \u00e0 escala da comunidade humana global. A identifica\u00e7\u00e3o das din\u00e2micas \n\nhumanas de usos com efeitos negativos e a identifica\u00e7\u00e3o das din\u00e2micas naturais que \n\nrealizam benef\u00edcios na manuten\u00e7\u00e3o do sistema comum, s\u00e3o uma tarefa base para perceber \n\nos conte\u00fados destas rela\u00e7\u00f5es e para poder organizar esta frui\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n\nUma vez que \u00e9 de todo imposs\u00edvel fazer coincidir a escala do bem \u201cambiente\u201d com os \n\nlimites dos territ\u00f3rios soberanos dos estados, e que o problema da defini\u00e7\u00e3o do objeto do \n\ndireito do ambiente pode ser ultrapassado atrav\u00e9s da defini\u00e7\u00e3o do Safe Operating Space, \n\nexistem neste momento as condi\u00e7\u00f5es necess\u00e1rias para se dar o salto conceptual na \n\ndefini\u00e7\u00e3o desse \u201cambiente salubre\u201d como um novo bem jur\u00eddico, que s\u00f3 pode ser \n\nassegurado \u00e0 escala do Sistema Terrestre. Por consequ\u00eancia, ao ser necess\u00e1rio \n\nampliarmos a escala do bem, tamb\u00e9m a escala da comunidade tem de ser ampliada \u00e0 \n\ntotalidade de sujeitos que partilham o uso do mesmo sistema, formando desta forma uma \n\nverdadeira comunidade de interesses comuns. Como consequ\u00eancia da impossibilidade de \n\ndivis\u00e3o do bem ambiente, o papel da Ecologia Humana como ponte entre as ci\u00eancias \n\nnaturais e o direito, ser\u00e1 o de estudar e propor solu\u00e7\u00f5es de auto-organiza\u00e7\u00e3o, no sentido \n\nde harmonizar as interdepend\u00eancias humanas globais que se estabelecem pela m\u00fatua \n\ndepend\u00eancia relativamente ao uso de um mesmo Sistema Comum. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n 45 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n 2.3. Um sistema jur\u00eddico baseado numa vis\u00e3o do mundo obsoleta \n\n \n\nNo contexto de um percurso hist\u00f3rico em que a exist\u00eancia humana chegou a ser \n\nformulada como uma realidade exterior e aut\u00f3noma \u00e0 natureza e/ou ecossistema global, \n\n\u00e9 natural que as constru\u00e7\u00f5es sociais sejam tamb\u00e9m um reflexo da hist\u00f3ria dessas \n\nmundivis\u00f5es. Por se tratar de um campo do conhecimento aut\u00f3nomo e fundado em \n\nprinc\u00edpios e estruturas l\u00f3gico-formais pr\u00f3prias, as constru\u00e7\u00f5es jur\u00eddicas refletem \n\ninevitavelmente o posicionamento ontol\u00f3gico do homem no seio da natureza. A valora\u00e7\u00e3o \n\njur\u00eddica do meio ambiente possui uma natureza cultural e por isso tende a expressar uma \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00e3o ontol\u00f3gica antropoc\u00eantrica. \u201cPor outras palavras, o meio ambiente somente foi \n\nintroduzido como suporte f\u00e1tico e, posteriormente, como fato jur\u00eddico em virtude de sua \n\ninternaliza\u00e7\u00e3o pela cultura humana, ou seja, pela sua representa\u00e7\u00e3o l\u00f3gico-formal em \n\nnormas jur\u00eddico-ambientais (Garcia 2016:90).\u201d  \n\nA transmuta\u00e7\u00e3o do \u201cbem ambiente\u201d de suporte f\u00e1ctico sobre o qual se exercem \n\ndiferentes formas de apropria\u00e7\u00e3o - direitos de soberania, propriedade ou de uso - para a \n\nconsagra\u00e7\u00e3o como bem jur\u00eddico aut\u00f3nomo com valor per si, \u00e9 o resultado do processo \n\nhist\u00f3rico da destrui\u00e7\u00e3o desse pr\u00f3prio \u201cbem ambiente\u201d, que transformou um bem \n\nabundante e que se pensava infinito, num bem escasso e limitado cuja deteriora\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nprovoca s\u00e9rios danos \u00e0s sociedades humanas e amea\u00e7a mesmo a sobreviv\u00eancia da pr\u00f3pria \n\nesp\u00e9cie. Este ser\u00e1 mesmo o motivo que transformou um bem que desde sempre foi \n\njuridicamente irrelevante como um \u201cvalor\u201d humanamente reconhecido. Como explica \n\nGarcia (2016:88) \u201cA rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Direito com a realidade, ou seja, do mundo das ideias \n\n(desdobramento da manifesta\u00e7\u00e3o cultural e \u00e9tica humana) com o mundo dos factos, d\u00e1-se \n\npor meio de v\u00ednculos previamente estabelecidos ou admitidos pelas normas. Quando \n\ndeterminado acontecimento \u00e9 constatado, a ocorr\u00eancia de efeitos jur\u00eddicos depender\u00e1 de \n\nseu reconhecimento por alguma norma e a correspondente atribui\u00e7\u00e3o de consequ\u00eancias \n\njur\u00eddicas\u201d.  \n\nPara chegarmos ao atual n\u00edvel de juridicidade, o meio ambiente evoluiu da absoluta \n\nirrelev\u00e2ncia jur\u00eddica para a consagra\u00e7\u00e3o como direito e bem fundamental, tendo invadido \n\n\n\n 46 \n\num grande n\u00famero de textos constitucionais por todo mundo. Com uma variedade \n\nalargada de express\u00f5es para traduzir este fen\u00f3meno natural complexo, a Constitui\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nPortuguesa no seu artigo 66\u00ba optou pelo conceito de um \u201cambiente sadio e ecologicamente \n\nequilibrado\u201d. Dado o seu car\u00e1cter sist\u00e9mico o \u201cbem ambiente\u201d \u00e9 incompat\u00edvel com a \n\ndelimita\u00e7\u00e3o territorial dos Estados, deu origem a que as defini\u00e7\u00f5es deste bem usem \n\nrecorrentemente conceitos indeterminados e de delimita\u00e7\u00e3o imprecisa. Ali\u00e1s, a dimens\u00e3o \n\nsist\u00e9mica do bem a proteger foi j\u00e1 percecionada no interior dos pr\u00f3prios Estados, uma vez \n\nque essa \u00e9 uma factualidade inultrapass\u00e1vel: \u201c[...] um Estado constitucional ecol\u00f3gico \n\npressup\u00f5e uma conce\u00e7\u00e3o integrada ou integrativa do ambiente e, consequentemente, um \n\ndireito integrado e integrativo do ambiente. [...] o conceito de direito integrado do \n\nambiente [...] aponta para a necessidade de uma prote\u00e7\u00e3o global e sistem\u00e1tica que n\u00e3o se \n\nreduza \u00e0 defesa isolada dos componentes ambientais naturais (ar, luz, \u00e1gua, solo vivo e \n\nsubsolo, flora, fauna) ou dos componentes humanos (paisagem, patrim\u00f3nio cultural e \n\nconstru\u00eddo, polui\u00e7\u00e3o), (Gomes Canotilho, 2010:8).\u201d  \n\nO Sistema Terrestre, embora percecionado e vivido diariamente pelos sentidos, foi ao \n\nlongo da hist\u00f3ria da humanidade um campo f\u00e9rtil para o inexplic\u00e1vel, para o \n\ndesenvolvimento de vis\u00f5es m\u00edsticas ou conceitos indeterminados. Numa total aus\u00eancia \n\nde informa\u00e7\u00e3o sobre as caracter\u00edsticas do Sistema Terrestre e dos fatores que determinam \n\na seu funcionamento, n\u00e3o se conhecendo sequer a exist\u00eancia de um estado favor\u00e1vel e de \n\nlimites para a sua manuten\u00e7\u00e3o, o resultado inevit\u00e1vel seria a sua invisibilidade social e a \n\nsua n\u00e3o considera\u00e7\u00e3o como fator essencial \u00e0 constru\u00e7\u00e3o de uma organiza\u00e7\u00e3o capaz de \n\nproteger as funda\u00e7\u00f5es da vida. N\u00e3o s\u00f3 n\u00e3o se conhecia, como a possibilidade de as \n\natividades humanas poderem estar a provocar uma mudan\u00e7a neste estado favor\u00e1vel eram \n\nquest\u00f5es que ultrapassavam os limites hipot\u00e9ticos do saber e fazer humano. O clima \n\nest\u00e1vel e o funcionamento regular dos ciclos da vida eram-nos apresentados como dados \n\npr\u00e9-adquiridos e imut\u00e1veis.  \n\nNeste cen\u00e1rio, onde o complexo e inexplic\u00e1vel se confunde com o inexistente, o \n\nm\u00edstico e o sagrado, n\u00e3o era poss\u00edvel reconhecer este estado favor\u00e1vel como um fator da \n\nmaior relev\u00e2ncia, e que pudesse ser defin\u00edvel e internalizado como um valor vital para a \n\nvida e organiza\u00e7\u00e3o das sociedades humanaa. \n\nAceitando a perspetiva do direito como constru\u00e7\u00e3o humana resultante do processo \n\nhist\u00f3rico-cultural da nossa esp\u00e9cie, Mosset Iturraspe (1999:303) define bem jur\u00eddico \n\ncomo \u201cbem \u00e9 tudo o que pode satisfazer uma necessidade. Um bem jur\u00eddico \u00e9 todo bem \n\nmaterial ou imaterial \u2013 de valor econ\u00f3mico ou n\u00e3o \u2013 que satisfaz necessidades do \n\n\n\n 47 \n\nhomem\u201d.  \n\nTal condi\u00e7\u00e3o deve-se \u00e0 exig\u00eancia, considerada b\u00e1sica e elementar pela teoria geral do \n\ndireito, de que os factos reconhecidos pelas normas jur\u00eddicas possuam relev\u00e2ncia para a \n\nvida humana. Da mesma forma, aquilo que for considerado inexpressivo ou irrelevante, \n\n\u00e9 igualmente ignorado pelo Direito. Esta tarefa primordial valorativa, coloca o Direito na \n\nposi\u00e7\u00e3o cr\u00edtica de permanentemente necessitar de se compatibilizar com a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\nconhecimento, procedendo a uma reinterpreta\u00e7\u00e3o da realidade tendo em conta as suas \n\nv\u00e1rias dimens\u00f5es e os novos contextos, evitando ficar preso a distor\u00e7\u00f5es cognitivas dos \n\nseus pr\u00f3prios dogmas. Conscientes da fragilidade de todas as constru\u00e7\u00f5es humanas e da \n\nenorme responsabilidade que cabe \u00e0s ci\u00eancias jur\u00eddicas nesta tarefa de interpretar e \n\nvalorar a realidade conhecida, sabemos que a \u00fanica forma de corresponder a este desafio \n\nser\u00e1 de estabelecer um permanente di\u00e1logo entre os seus conceitos e o seu modus \n\noperandi, e a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o do conhecimento cient\u00edfico e social. Mas nas ci\u00eancias naturais, \n\ncomo nas ci\u00eancias da vida, todos os avan\u00e7os s\u00e3o simultaneamente geradores de liberdade \n\ne de novas responsabilidades: \u201cA aplica\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00e9cnica das novas ci\u00eancias da vida (o conjunto \n\ndas chamadas biotecnologias) alargou, de forma in\u00e9dita o \u00e2mbito do fazer humano; \n\npodemos dizer que, pela primeira vez, na hist\u00f3ria da humanidade, o homem disp\u00f5e de um \n\nsaber que lhe permite exercer poder sobre a natureza, sobre a vida e sobre a morte, isto \u00e9, \n\nsobre o que antigamente fugia \u00e0 sua al\u00e7ada e era considerado fatalidade ou, de um modo \n\ndeterminista, uma sequ\u00eancia puramente casual de acontecimentos. \n\nNo entanto, este poder, libertador e gerador de autonomia, tem-se revelado amb\u00edguo e \n\nperigoso: desencadeia efeitos extremamente ben\u00e9ficos e simultaneamente a\u00e7\u00f5es cujas as \n\nconsequ\u00eancias perigosas t\u00eam uma dimens\u00e3o c\u00f3smica e muitas vezes irrevers\u00edvel. \u00c9 \n\njustamente isto o que nos assusta e inquieta, exigindo-nos pela primeira vez, \n\nresponsabilidade. De facto, tudo o que nos envolve pode, hoje, pela primeira vez, \n\ndepender inteiramente de n\u00f3s. (Silva, 2002.10)\u201d \n\nO estudo recente sobre as consequ\u00eancias das a\u00e7\u00f5es humanas sobre o ambiente, trouxe-\n\nnos a informa\u00e7\u00e3o sobre o funcionamento do Sistema Terrestre, e esse \u201cambiente \n\necologicamente sadio\u201d abandonou a condi\u00e7\u00e3o de conceito indeterminado de contornos \n\nespaciais e qualitativos incertos, para se traduzir no espa\u00e7o intang\u00edvel de seguran\u00e7a bem \n\ndefinido, que n\u00e3o conhece fronteiras. Isto \u00e9, hoje conseguimos identificar quais s\u00e3o os \n\nelementos que determinam o funcionamento do Sistema Terrestre e de que forma e em \n\nque medida ao alterarmos esses fatores, interferimos no funcionamento do sistema do \n\nqual somos parte. De facto, hoje, tudo o que nos envolve, desde o pr\u00f3prio genoma da \n\n\n\n 48 \n\nnossa esp\u00e9cie, ao \u201cc\u00f3digo gen\u00e9tico\u201d do funcionamento do Sistema Terrestre, tudo pode \n\nrealmente depender inteiramente de n\u00f3s. O facto de termos provocado estas altera\u00e7\u00f5es \n\naos mecanismos e condi\u00e7\u00f5es essenciais de suporte da vida, deu-nos acesso a um \n\nconhecimento que gerou um enorme poder e uma tremenda responsabilidade \u00e0 a\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nhumano no seu todo. \n\nEsta possibilidade requer por parte do direito do ambiente uma interven\u00e7\u00e3o que \n\nultrapassa a sua considera\u00e7\u00e3o como \u201cramo de direito\u201d, e convoca-o para uma evolu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nque seja capaz de representar uma nova mundivid\u00eancia em que os elementos n\u00e3o-\n\nterritoriais que asseguram a condi\u00e7\u00f5es biogeof\u00edsicas da vida, estejam no centro em torno \n\ndo quais se regulam as rela\u00e7\u00f5es que se realizam entre todos os seres humanos, numa \n\nescala global.  \n\nOra, como afirma Garcia (2016:89), \u201cA primeira quest\u00e3o a ser enfrentada pelo Direito \n\nAmbiental \u00e9 o de identificar seu objeto principal ou centro de tutela. Em que pese ser \n\nposs\u00edvel apresentar a resposta \u201cmeio ambiente\u201d de maneira r\u00e1pida e l\u00f3gica, o que se busca, \n\nverdadeiramente responder \u00e9 de qual meio ambiente se est\u00e1 efetivamente tratando.\u201d Por \n\nmuito que o bem em causa n\u00e3o se confine \u00e0s divis\u00f5es pol\u00edtico-administrativas, o car\u00e1cter \n\nglobal, indivis\u00edvel e interdependente do estado funcional favor\u00e1vel do Sistema Terrestre \n\n\u00e9 uma factualidade inultrapass\u00e1vel. Constituindo as funda\u00e7\u00f5es da vida como a \n\nconhecemos at\u00e9 hoje, o seu valor \u00e9 obviamente vital, inquestion\u00e1vel e incontroverso. \u00c9 o \n\nmeta-valor, que assegura e suporta as condi\u00e7\u00f5es de vida na Terra, e da pr\u00f3pria esp\u00e9cie \n\nhumana. Neste sentido, como refere o Ac\u00f3rd\u00e3o de 02/07/1996 Proc. N\u00aa. 483/96 do \n\nSupremo Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a: \u201cRepare-se neste pormenor t\u00e3o simples quanto \n\nincontroverso: se as condi\u00e7\u00f5es reais levarem \u00e0 desarticula\u00e7\u00e3o dos meios ambientais que \n\npermitam, efetivamente viver, o direito \u00e0 vida n\u00e3o passar\u00e1 de uma abstra\u00e7\u00e3o te\u00f3rica de \n\ncurto prazo. (\u2026).\u201c Ao n\u00e3o abarcar o \u201cbem ambiente\u201d na sua verdadeira escala, o direito \n\ncorre o perigo de ocultar o seu verdadeiro sentido, e o seu dever-ser. Neste ac\u00f3rd\u00e3o, \u201co \n\nnosso Supremo Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a, realiza a dif\u00edcil tarefa de organizar (de forma \n\nestrat\u00e9gica e prudente) a passagem de uma intencionalidade espiritual, um dever-ser \n\npatente nas normas constitucionais, para um \"ser\" realizado por esse esp\u00edrito, e tornar-se \n\nnum promotor efetivo do processo hist\u00f3rico-cultural, apontando o afinamento da \n\nestrat\u00e9gia de a\u00e7\u00e3o, assumindo a dimens\u00e3o vital do jur\u00eddico no seu sentido modelador da \n\nvida, perante aquela que \u00e9 considerada como a principal crise com que a humanidade \n\nalguma vez se defrontou (Magalh\u00e3es 2005:96).\u201d \n\n\n\n 49 \n\nEsta dimens\u00e3o qualitativa - the healthiness \u2013 do Sistema Terrestre, escapa \u00e0s \n\nabordagens jur\u00eddico-dogm\u00e1ticas tradicionais sobre o ambiente, pelo facto de ser \n\nimposs\u00edvel isolar um determinado ecossistema, regi\u00e3o ou pa\u00eds, da qualidade do sistema \n\nglobal. Isto \u00e9, as principais caracter\u00edsticas do \u201cbem ambiental\u201d s\u00e3o a sua globalidade e \n\nintangibilidade \u2013 o Sistema Terrestre \u00e9 global e indivis\u00edvel, e a qualidade do seu estado \n\ndepende da sua estrutura biogeoqu\u00edmica global, uma vez que esta vai ser determinante no \n\nfuncionamento dos seus fluxos e balan\u00e7os energ\u00e9ticos \u2013 os chamados ciclos \n\nbiogeof\u00edsicos. Estas caracter\u00edsticas obrigam a que a prote\u00e7\u00e3o do ambiente se alargue \u00e0 \n\nprote\u00e7\u00e3o de bens intang\u00edveis naturais, e \u00e0 escala em que o bem existe \u2013  a global.  \n\nOra, o cumprimento da fun\u00e7\u00e3o modeladora do direito e de concretizar esta passagem \n\nde um dever-ser de um ambiente \u201csadio e ecologicamente equilibrado\u201d, para a constru\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde uma sociedade humana adaptada ao funcionamento do Sistema Terrestre e aos seus \n\nlimites, implica uma nova vis\u00e3o do mundo em que esse \u201cbem ambiente\u201d ser\u00e1 mais do que \n\na soma dos conceitos indeterminados presentes numa alargada quantidade de \n\nConstitui\u00e7\u00f5es Estatais e em Tratados Internacionais. O desafio que o Antropoceno coloca \n\nao Direito \u00e9 o de atrav\u00e9s de um exerc\u00edcio de interdisciplinaridade se tornar numa ci\u00eancia \n\npromotora do processo hist\u00f3rico-cultural que leve ao reconhecimento \u201cdeste ambiente \n\nsadio e ecologicamente equilibrado\u201d, como um bem jur\u00eddico na sua verdadeira escala \u2013 a \n\nglobal - e relativamente ao seu verdadeiro sujeito \u2013 a comunidade humana na sua \n\nglobalidade.  \n\nA relev\u00e2ncia vital do Safe Operating Space for Humankind, \u00e9 uma factualidade \n\ninultrapass\u00e1vel. S\u00f3 que este fen\u00f3meno agora conhecido e definido, n\u00e3o \u00e9 ainda \n\nsocialmente reconhecido por nenhuma norma, nem a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de benef\u00edcios ou danos \n\nno estado deste bem comum vital \u00e9 desencadeadora de consequ\u00eancias jur\u00eddicas. A \n\nnecessidade da sua internaliza\u00e7\u00e3o por parte da organiza\u00e7\u00e3o das sociedades humanas, \n\nparece uma evid\u00eancia. O facto de este bem existir dentro e fora de todas as soberanias, \n\nn\u00e3o pode ser um obst\u00e1culo ao seu reconhecimento como um fen\u00f3meno relevante para a \n\nhumanidade. Isto \u00e9, a partir do momento em que determinado facto ecol\u00f3gico se torna da \n\nmaior relev\u00e2ncia para o ser humano, \u00e9 natural que esse bem que at\u00e9 ali tenha sido \n\nconsiderado irrelevante, seja reconhecido como bem e jur\u00eddico.  \n\nN\u00e3o s\u00f3 o bem jur\u00eddico \u00e9 uma constru\u00e7\u00e3o puramente humana que existe num processo \n\nde permanente evolu\u00e7\u00e3o e aperfei\u00e7oamento hist\u00f3rico, como tamb\u00e9m lembra Bosselmann \n\n(2015:61), as constru\u00e7\u00f5es jur\u00eddicas humanas existentes, n\u00e3o s\u00e3o um valor per si: \u201cIt may \n\nbe time now to remind ourselves that the law has no intrinsic value, but is a mere human \n\n\n\n 50 \n\nconstruct intended to govern ourselves in a civilized manner. However, what could be \n\nmore civilized than caring for the conditions that make human life possible in the first \n\nplace. It is here where the concern for the integrity of life as a whole has its place. And it \n\nis here where a renewed sense of the rule of law must have its beginning.\u201d \n\nO principio de tudo, da possibilidade da constru\u00e7\u00e3o de uma civiliza\u00e7\u00e3o humana como \n\na que possu\u00edmos hoje dependeu destas condi\u00e7\u00f5es favor\u00e1veis intang\u00edveis que hoje \n\nconseguimos identificar e mensurar. E a partir do momento que os limites do planeta do \n\nHoloceno s\u00e3o quantific\u00e1veis, essa integridade pode ser usada como medida de legalidade \n\ndo agir humano. \n\nIsto \u00e9, o \u201cbem ambiente\u201d estado favor\u00e1vel do Sistema Terrestre, como fen\u00f3meno \n\nnatural do mundo real, que anteriormente se aparentava como imut\u00e1vel e infinito cujo o \n\nfazer humano era incapaz sequer de o atingir ou alterar, passou de juridicamente \n\nirrelevante e inexistente, \u00e0 mais valiosa heran\u00e7a recebida pela humanidade da natureza. \n\nEsse novo bem, resultante de uma valora\u00e7\u00e3o enunciada por uma norma jur\u00eddica, ir\u00e1 ser \n\nirradiador de direitos e deveres que dever\u00e3o constituir a base organizativa do uso regulado \n\ndeste bem comum global, da qual poder\u00e1 emergir uma nova harmoniza\u00e7\u00e3o das rela\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nhumanas que agora se alargam ao global. \n\n \n\n2.4. A desmaterializa\u00e7\u00e3o do Bem Ambiental \n\n \n\n \n\nO facto de o estado favor\u00e1vel do Sistema Terrestre ser, como o pr\u00f3prio nome indica, \n\num sistema, e como tal ser essencialmente composto por elementos n\u00e3o-territoriais e \n\nintang\u00edveis, isto \u00e9, pelos ciclos biogeof\u00edsicos que se dispersam e atravessam todo o \n\nplaneta, n\u00e3o pode constituir um obst\u00e1culo intranspon\u00edvel \u00e0 sua qualifica\u00e7\u00e3o como \n\nfen\u00f3meno ecol\u00f3gico juridicamente relevante para o ser humano.  \n\nA exist\u00eancia de coisas incorp\u00f3reas, h\u00e1 muito que \u00e9 reconhecida pela cultura humana. \n\nO conceito de coisa incorp\u00f3rea e a sua estrutura de defini\u00e7\u00e3o buscam as suas origens na \n\nfilosofia grega, mais especificamente da escola aristot\u00e9lica: de facto, Arist\u00f3teles diz-nos \n\nque coisas incorp\u00f3reas s\u00e3o aquelas que n\u00e3o podem ser tocadas. O que pode ser percebido \n\ncom os sentidos \u00e9 um corpus, uma coisa corp\u00f3rea; o que n\u00e3o pode ser tocado \u00e9 uma coisa \n\nincorp\u00f3rea, apenas percet\u00edvel atrav\u00e9s do intelecto. Os juristas romanos seguiram os passos \n\n\n\n 51 \n\nda cultura grega, e classificaram os bens como: res corporales e res incorporales. \n\nSegundo Mousourakis (2012:121,122) \u201cWith respect to the res in nostro patrimonio (or \n\nres in commercio), a distinction was drawn between corporeal (res corporales) and \n\nincorporeal thing (res incorporales). The former term referred to things that could be \n\ntouched or perceived by the senses such as a garment, an ox, a table or a house. The term \n\nres incorporales, on the other hand, denoted intangible things no capable of sensory \n\nperception that the law recognizes and protect, such a real and personal rights. (\u2026) \n\nBecause incorporeal objects could not be physically seized as required for possession to \n\nexist, they thus could not be acquired or transferred by any method involving the \n\nacquisition or transfer of possession.\u201d \n\nCoisas corp\u00f3reas s\u00e3o aquelas que pela sua natureza s\u00e3o dotadas de exist\u00eancia f\u00edsica, \n\nmaterial, que podem ser tocadas, como um terreno, uma casa, etc... . Por outro lado, coisas \n\nincorp\u00f3reas, s\u00e3o aquelas coisas que embora n\u00e3o possam ser tocadas, possuem uma \n\nexist\u00eancia abstrata ou ideal, isto \u00e9, existem para a lei; como por exemplo, uma heran\u00e7a, \n\nusufruto ou uma obriga\u00e7\u00e3o. Inicialmente, apenas os direitos reais eram considerados res \n\nincorporales. Posteriormente, como resultado de uma luta liderada pelos dos intelectuais \n\ndo s\u00e9culo XVIII, que reivindicavam reconhecimento das \u201cideias\u201d ou \u201ccria\u00e7\u00f5es do esp\u00edrito \n\nhumano\u201d, segundo o principio de que a obra \u00e9 independente de qualquer fixa\u00e7\u00e3o ou \n\nmaterializa\u00e7\u00e3o (Ascen\u00e7\u00e3o 1992.62), os direitos pessoais foram igualmente reconhecidos \n\ncomo coisa incorp\u00f3rea. O reconhecimento \u201cobra humana\u201d como coisa incorp\u00f3rea, isto \u00e9, \n\nde que a ideia per si, depois de tomar forma no foro \u00edntimo do autor e de ser exteriorizada \n\npor qualquer meio de forma que seja poss\u00edvel ser captada pelos sentidos, teve o seu \n\nreconhecimento como objeto juridicamente relevante em 1710 atrav\u00e9s da c\u00e9lebre lei do \n\ncopyright da Rainha Ana de Inglaterra. Atrav\u00e9s desta lei o direito de reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o, j\u00e1 n\u00e3o \n\npertencia em favor dos impressores, mas j\u00e1 em favor dos autores, constituindo \n\nsimultaneamente um direito pessoal do autor e um novo objeto jur\u00eddico imaterial. Isto \u00e9, \n\neste normativo legal permitiu estabelecer uma divis\u00e3o jur\u00eddica entre o direito intang\u00edvel \n\ndo autor e o suporte material em que a obra est\u00e1 gravada, criando desta forma um objeto \n\njur\u00eddico intang\u00edvel \u2013 a ideia, a cria\u00e7\u00e3o intelectual do autor. \u00c9 esta separa\u00e7\u00e3o, que nos \n\npermite por exemplo, que ao comprarmos um livro apenas adquiramos a titularidade \n\nsobre o papel e tinta que constitui o suporte da grava\u00e7\u00e3o da obra, e n\u00e3o os sobre os direitos \n\nrelativos \u00e0 obra que est\u00e1 ali gravada. De juridicamente inexistente at\u00e9 ao in\u00edcio do S\u00e9culo \n\nXVIII, a ideia intang\u00edvel do autor, tornou-se, na opini\u00e3o dos intelectuais da \u00e9poca, na \n\n\u201cmais sagrada de todas as propriedades\u201d. \n\n\n\n 52 \n\nEstas solu\u00e7\u00f5es t\u00e9cnico-jur\u00eddicas constituem alguns dos alicerces estruturais em que \n\nse baseia a nossa organiza\u00e7\u00e3o social. Por exemplo, sem esta separa\u00e7\u00e3o legal entre a ideia \n\nintang\u00edvel de um autor e o suporte tang\u00edvel onde esta ideia \u00e9 registada, n\u00e3o teria sido \n\nposs\u00edvel o desenvolvimento do conhecimento nem sua dissemina\u00e7\u00e3o em massa. Mas o \n\nreconhecimento jur\u00eddico de objetos intang\u00edveis n\u00e3o se ficou pelo copyright. O patrim\u00f3nio \n\ncultural imaterial reconhecido atrav\u00e9s da UNESCO, ou o valor intang\u00edvel das empresas \n\nem direito comercial, onde frequentemente o valor dos ativos intang\u00edveis de uma empresa \n\ns\u00e3o incomparavelmente superiores aos ativos tang\u00edveis, s\u00e3o outros exemplos em que a \n\nnecessidade de organizar o uso de algo ou a relev\u00e2ncia dos bens em causa, justificaram a \n\nbusca por novas solu\u00e7\u00f5es por parte do direito. Os objetos jur\u00eddicos intang\u00edveis foram um \n\nfator determinante de desenvolvimento e um suporte estrutural cr\u00edtico na cria\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nciviliza\u00e7\u00e3o em que vivemos hoje.  \n\nA analogia entre esses objetos de direito intang\u00edveis e o Sistema de Terrestre igualmente \n\nintang\u00edvel pode tamb\u00e9m ser crucial para representar e compreender a funcionalidade \n\nglobal e indivis\u00edvel do Sistema da Terrestre na nossa sociedade, bem como o valor real \n\ndos ecossistemas naturais, onde o valor intang\u00edvel dos seus servi\u00e7os para a humanidade \u00e9 \n\nincomparavelmente superior ao valor tang\u00edvel das infraestruturas naturais que produzem \n\nesses servi\u00e7os. Atualmente, por exemplo, o valor das florestas que s\u00e3o vitais para a \n\nmanuten\u00e7\u00e3o desse estado favor\u00e1vel, das nossas vidas e as futuras gera\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00f3 se tornam \n\nvis\u00edveis nas transa\u00e7\u00f5es financeiras e econ\u00f3micas da sociedade atrav\u00e9s da destrui\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\ntransforma\u00e7\u00e3o dessas florestas em madeira. Na verdade, tamb\u00e9m na natureza existem \n\noutros tipos de patrim\u00f3nio para al\u00e9m daqueles que podem ser vistos e tocados. Isto obriga \n\na pensar o conceito de capital natural, n\u00e3o apenas como o espa\u00e7o e as infraestruturas \n\necol\u00f3gicas tang\u00edveis, mas a considerar o seu conjunto, como a soma resultante da \n\ntotalidade da infraestrutura ecol\u00f3gica tang\u00edvel e da totalidade altera\u00e7\u00f5es qu\u00edmicas \n\nbiogeof\u00edsicas positivas que constituem os servi\u00e7os ecol\u00f3gicos globais intang\u00edveis. Feitas \n\nas contas, tendo em conta o caracter vital destes servi\u00e7os e a sua escassez, os ativos \n\nintang\u00edveis naturais ter\u00e3o uma import\u00e2ncia muito superior aos proporcionados pelos \n\nrecursos f\u00edsicos tang\u00edveis na produ\u00e7\u00e3o de bens e servi\u00e7os.  \n\nEste processo hist\u00f3rico \u00e9 da maior import\u00e2ncia para percebermos como este processo \n\nde desmaterializa\u00e7\u00e3o do objeto do direito foi um fator estrutural de profundo significado \n\nna constru\u00e7\u00e3o das sociedades modernas, e como as solu\u00e7\u00f5es jur\u00eddicas organizativas s\u00e3o \n\num fator estrutural dos modelos sociais. \n\n\n\n 53 \n\n \n\n \n 2.5 A natureza intang\u00edvel como conex\u00e3o entre Sistema Social e Sistema \nTerrestre. \n \n\nNum trabalho recente sobre o Global Commons no Antropoceno (Nakicenovic,N., \n\nRockstrom,J., Gaffney,O. 2016), identificam-se alguns biomas cr\u00edticos como bens \n\ncomuns globais: \u201cThe critical biomes (Figura 3) that regulate regional energy flows, \n\nhydrological flows, and carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles and provide stable \n\nhabitats for living species are under threat. These biomes are interconnected with each \n\nother \u2013 moisture feedback from the Amazon rainforest affects the temperature and \n\nfunction of the tropical monsoon system, which in turn may interact with the global \n\nclimate system. Critical biomes play a decisive role in regulating the overall status of the \n\nlife-support system on Earth, that is, how well Earth can support world development. \n\nSignificantly, the resilience of ecosystems, critical biomes, and the biosphere as a whole \n\ndetermines the degree of feedback (negative or positive, weak or strong) to the climate \n\nsystem, which regulates the degree of global warming, which in turn, generates a direct \n\nfeedback to the biosphere, affecting all ecosystems.\u201d  \n\n \n\n \n  \n \n\n\n\n 54 \n\n \nFigura 3. Global Commons in the Anthropocene: World Development in a Stable and Resilient Planet. \nNakicenovic,N., Rockstrom,J., Gaffney,O. and Zimm,C., IIASA Working Paper \u2013 WP16-019. P.29,30. \n2016 \n \n\n \n\n\n\n 55 \n\nComo observamos na figura 3, os crit\u00e9rios que estiveram na base da escolha destes Global \n\nCommons in the Antropocene tiveram por base um crit\u00e9rio qualitativo-funcional, \u00e0 qual \n\nacresce a dimens\u00e3o da quantidade em que estes servi\u00e7os qualitativos s\u00e3o prestados, \n\nresultando na defini\u00e7\u00e3o das infraestruturas ecol\u00f3gicas que possuem maior relev\u00e2ncia na \n\nresili\u00eancia do planeta. Isto \u00e9, da soma da qualidade e da quantidade dos global ecosystem \n\nservices prestados, resulta a sua classifica\u00e7\u00e3o como Critical Biomas. No entanto esta \n\nlistagem merece da nossa parte a seguinte an\u00e1lise cr\u00edtica: \n\na) Biodiversidade global \u2013 embora seja abordada na \u00f3tica da perda total em n\u00famero \n\nde esp\u00e9cies, ela n\u00e3o deixa de estar territorialmente vinculada aos Estados onde essas \n\nesp\u00e9cies e comunidades; habitats e ecossistemas est\u00e3o localizados. O mesmo tamb\u00e9m se \n\npode referir quanto ao pa\u00eds de origem dos recursos gen\u00e9ticos, isto \u00e9, \u201cCountry of origin \n\nof genetic resources \u2013 The country which possess those genetic resources in situ \n\nconditions\u201d, conforme definido no artigo 2\u00ba da Conven\u00e7\u00e3o da Diversidade Biol\u00f3gica. A \n\nbiodiversidade possui uma exist\u00eancia material que \u00e9 em grande medida geograficamente \n\ndelimit\u00e1vel, e como tal, reivindicada pelos Estados que exercem a jurisdi\u00e7\u00e3o sobre os \n\nterrit\u00f3rios onde a biodiversidade est\u00e1 localizada; \n\n \n\nb) Os ciclos biogeoqu\u00edmicos - elementos n\u00e3o-territoriais e intang\u00edveis, com uma \n\ncircula\u00e7\u00e3o permanente de caracter global n\u00e3o geograficamente delimit\u00e1vel, e cuja divis\u00e3o \n\njur\u00eddica ou apropria\u00e7\u00e3o f\u00edsica s\u00e3o imposs\u00edveis; \n\n \n\nc) Biomas Cr\u00edticos \u2013 v\u00e1rios tipos de infraestruturas ecol\u00f3gicas que prestam esses servi\u00e7os \n\nde ecossistema de impacto e interesse global, possuindo dessa forma um valor \n\ndeterminante na manuten\u00e7\u00e3o e resili\u00eancia do Sistema Terrestre (Florestas Tropicais, \n\nFlorestas Boreais, Criosfera), mas que s\u00e3o territorialmente delimit\u00e1veis. Nesta listagem \n\nidentifica-se mesmo a sua localiza\u00e7\u00e3o espec\u00edfica, como por exemplo: Amaz\u00f3nia, \n\nFlorestas Tropicais da \u00c1sia do Sul, Florestas Boreais da Europa ou os Glaciares de \n\nMontanha de todo o mundo.  \n\n \n\n Se de um ponto de vista das Ci\u00eancias do Sistema Terrestre, a identifica\u00e7\u00e3o destes \n\nbiomas cr\u00edticos faz todo o sentido, j\u00e1 a sua classifica\u00e7\u00e3o como Global Commons, merece \n\nd\u00favidas da nossa parte. Como conceito jur\u00eddico que \u00e9, e segundo a pr\u00f3pria defini\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nUNEP- \u201cThe \u2018Global Commons\u2019 refers to resource domains or areas that lie outside of \n\nthe political reach of any one nation State. Thus, international law identifies four global \n\n\n\n 56 \n\ncommons namely: The High Seas; the Atmosphere; Antarctica; and, Outer Space. These \n\nareas have historically been guided by the principle of the common heritage of humankind \n\n- the open access doctrine or the mare liberum (free sea for everyone) in the case of the \n\nHigh Seas. Despite efforts by governments or individuals to establish property rights or \n\nother forms of control over most natural resources, the Global Commons have remained \n\nan exception.\u201d \n\nO crit\u00e9rio que fundamenta esta classifica\u00e7\u00e3o proposta para os Global Commons in \n\nthe Anthopocene n\u00e3o \u00e9 o particular interesse cient\u00edfico, est\u00e9tico ou natural de um ou outro \n\nbioma, mas sim a import\u00e2ncia qualitativa em termos do impacto que estes biomas cr\u00edticos \n\npossuem nos ciclos biogeoqu\u00edmicos globais e a consequente influ\u00eancia destes nos fluxos \n\nenerg\u00e9ticos, que no conjunto da sua intera\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o determinantes na manuten\u00e7\u00e3o do estado \n\nfavor\u00e1vel do Sistema Terrestre. Ao incluir nesta lista de Global Commons para o \n\nAntropoceno os ciclos biogeoqu\u00edmicos, os biomas cr\u00edticos e a biodiversidade, esta \n\nproposta mistura no mesmo conceito elementos territoriais ou territorialmente \n\ndelimit\u00e1veis com elementos n\u00e3o-territoriais. Como \u00e9 sabido, do ponto de vista jur\u00eddico, e \n\nde acordo com o principio da territorialidade, n\u00e3o \u00e9 poss\u00edvel classificar como Global \n\nCommons parcelas de territ\u00f3rio que est\u00e3o sob a jurisdi\u00e7\u00e3o de um determinado Estado. \u00c9 \n\numa ilus\u00e3o pensar que um Estado que possua no interior no seu territ\u00f3rio algum destes \n\nbiomas cr\u00edticos, v\u00e1 abdicar da soberania sobre essa parcela de territ\u00f3rio em favor de um \n\nregime legal de Global Commons ou Patrim\u00f3nio Comum da Humanidade.  \n\nReconhecendo a import\u00e2ncia determinante destes biomas nos ciclos biogeoqu\u00edmicos \n\nglobais, a solu\u00e7\u00e3o passar\u00e1 inevitavelmente pela procura de novos conceitos baseados nos \n\nconhecimentos cient\u00edficos entretanto desenvolvidos e que procedem a uma leitura da \n\nrealidade n\u00e3o exclusivamente territorial.  \n\nSendo certo que todos estes biomas cr\u00edticos s\u00e3o territorialmente delimit\u00e1veis e \n\ntang\u00edveis, estando sob a jurisdi\u00e7\u00e3o de um ou mais Estados (com exce\u00e7\u00e3o da Ant\u00e1rtida e \n\ndo \u00c1rtico), e que o motivo desta classifica\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 a sua contribui\u00e7\u00e3o determinante na \n\nmanuten\u00e7\u00e3o do estado favor\u00e1vel do Sistema Terrestre, somos obrigados a chegar \u00e0 \n\nconclus\u00e3o de que o que \u00e9 verdadeiramente comum a toda a humanidade s\u00e3o os \n\nbenef\u00edcios(os \u201cglobal ecosystem services\u201d) realizados por esses biomas nos ciclos \n\nbiogeof\u00edsicos globais. Por outras palavras, o que \u00e9 realmente Global Common nestes \n\nbiomas, s\u00e3o os servi\u00e7os intang\u00edveis prestados a todo o Sistema da Terrestre, e n\u00e3o a \n\ninfraestrutura natural f\u00edsica em si, que est\u00e1 sob a jurisdi\u00e7\u00e3o de um ou mais Estados. Quer \n\nisto dizer que se repudiarmos a tenta\u00e7\u00e3o material\u00edstica e territorialista, e procedermos a \n\n\n\n 57 \n\numa distin\u00e7\u00e3o jur\u00eddica entre os servi\u00e7os intang\u00edveis dos ecossistemas e a infraestrutura  \n\ntang\u00edvel natural que os realizou, isto \u00e9, reconhecendo que a natureza n\u00e3o \u00e9 apenas o \n\nconjunto dos bens tang\u00edveis que formam o ecossistema (por exemplo florestas tropicais) \n\ne o espa\u00e7o geogr\u00e1fico delimit\u00e1vel e mensur\u00e1vel em hectares, mas tamb\u00e9m o ativo \n\nintang\u00edvel concretizado pelas altera\u00e7\u00f5es positivas nos ciclos biogeoqu\u00edmicos que ali se \n\nprocessam, podemos criar uma representa\u00e7\u00e3o da natureza com uma maior capacidade de \n\na retratar e traduzir o seu real valor.  \n\nDado que estes ciclos existem apenas na escala global, s\u00f3 a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de um objeto de \n\ndireito intang\u00edvel global pode representar este fen\u00f3meno natural da maior relev\u00e2ncia para \n\na humanidade \u2013 o Sistema Terrestre.

Na verdade, todos os planetas conhecidos t\u00eam uma \u00e1rea geogr\u00e1fica que pode ser \n\ndimensionada em km2. O que os outros planetas n\u00e3o possuem \u00e9 um sistema intang\u00edvel \n\nacoplado ao planeta f\u00edsico, capaz de sustentar a vida, tal como a conhecemos. Do ponto \n\nde vista jur\u00eddico, o planeta tem apenas uma exist\u00eancia: a \u00e1rea do territ\u00f3rio. Essa vis\u00e3o \n\nunidimensional deixa de fora a express\u00e3o mais not\u00e1vel e vital da natureza - o \n\nfuncionamento do Sistema da Terra como um sistema de suporte de vida \u00fanico e \n\ncomplexo. \n\nSe aceitarmos que a natureza possui igualmente uma dimens\u00e3o intang\u00edvel, que o \n\nSistema Terrestre \u00e9 o nosso principal Global Common, e encontramos forma de \n\nrepresentar esta realidade factual na nossa organiza\u00e7\u00e3o social, reconhecendo-o como bem \n\njuridicamente relevante do qual dever\u00e3o emergir consequ\u00eancias jur\u00eddicas, novas formas \n\nde coordena\u00e7\u00e3o global podem ser imaginadas. \n\nSe, tal como nos direitos de autor, em que existe uma separa\u00e7\u00e3o jur\u00eddica entre a obra  \n\ne o suporte f\u00edsico em que est\u00e1 gravada, procedermos igualmente aqui a uma separa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nlegal entre os servi\u00e7os intang\u00edveis produzidos pela infraestrutura natural tang\u00edvel que \n\nforneceu esses servi\u00e7os, e esses servi\u00e7os intang\u00edveis se tornassem socialmente vis\u00edveis \n\nnum novo objeto legal intang\u00edvel global, esses servi\u00e7os passariam a ter sua exist\u00eancia \n\nreconhecida no novo bem comum global, dessa forma os global Earth System services \n\npoderiam tornar-se em ativos econ\u00f3micos intang\u00edveis.

He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated \nfrom the rest... a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness.\u201d \n\n Albert Einstein \n \n \n \n\n \n3.1. Tragedy Without Territory \n\n \nIt is now widely accepted that climate change is a \u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d on a \n\nglobal scale. When a tragedy is occurring simultaneously inside and outside all borders, \n\nit does not comply with the principle of territoriality of jurisdictions or of norms. It is a \n\nsuperimposed common reality in all territories, without having a territory. Also, in the \n\ndominant view of \u201cterritorial obsession\u201d, existing is to have territory. Being global is not \n\nhaving territory. The underlying principle is the assumption that everything that goes \n\nbeyond our limits should be considered as external to us \u2013 an externality in the words of \n\neconomists. Pollution from an aircraft is an externality for the economy and when \n\nperformed outside the airspace of states, it becomes a case for jurists. \n\nBased on this vision, one can define common areas where theoretically all of humanity \n\nbecomes sovereign over the international commons (res communis omnium), in which \n\nthe \u201ccommon\u201d is what is left over (open sea, seabed, Antarctica), the remains of what \n\ncould not be seized. Pureza (1998:26) considers that \u201cthe res communis own regime as a \n\ntraditional framework for common international spaces is a sequence rather than an \n\n                                                \n4 Cap\u00edtulo realizado em co-autoria com Francisco Ferreira. \n \n\n\n\n 62 \n\nantithesis of the national sovereignty principle\u201d. The common is not that by which its \n\nnature and characteristics is truly common but what remains after appropriation. \n\nIn the confrontation between this one-dimensional simplification of the world and the \n\nhighly complex and deeply interconnected Earth System, we are flooded with more \n\nquestions than answers: Whose tragedy? Where does the responsibility for acting lie? \n\nWho has the instruments to act for the benefit of all? How can we speak about benefiting \n\neveryone if humanity, being global, has no territory, a fact that by itself gives rise to its \n\nlegal non-existence? Yet, are there any organized people in a territorial political \n\ncommunity that do not belong to humanity? If humanity exists materially, and is just one \n\nsingle family with a common origin, will it cease to exist just because it doesn\u2019t exist in \n\na formally organized political territory? Can the concept of sovereignty exist without the \n\nprospect of an unlimited temporal projection into the next generations? \n\nAs sophisticated as societies and their technologies can be, the organization of social \n\nlife leads us invariably to the same primary questions: What is mine? What is yours? \n\nWhat is common or public, or what doesn't belong to anyone? But the reality is always \n\nmore complex than these simplified operations. To the questions whose simple solutions \n\nof separation serve as responses, we can add another: What is simultaneously mine, yours \n\nand everyone\u2019s in an overlapping and symbiotic way? \n\nAs we will see throughout this book, there is no simple answer to this complex \n\nquestion, especially if we look at property not only as a form of ownership over something \n\nbut also as an organizing tool of social relations. It is at the crossroads of belonging to all, \n\nowned by no one where \u2018belonging to\u2019 does not have any clear legal definition, and whose \n\noutcome is often resolved by resorting to res nullius. Kiss (1982:122) came very close to \n\nthe essence of the issue when he asked: \u201cHow can a good that belongs to no one be subject \n\nto a legal regime?\u201d From this paradox, and because legal existence is inextricably linked \n\nto some form of \"ownership\", emerges what was classified as the doctrine of \u201ccomplex \n\nproperty\u201d. \n\nNew questions always elicit new answers. However, it is interesting to note that even \n\nas we surpass the Earth\u2019s borders and launch into the conquest of space, the same classic \n\nquestions invariably arise. Oosterlinck (1996:1), in his article \u201cTangible and Intangible \n\nProperty in Outer Space\u201d, states: \u201cProperty in space is certainly one of the most important \n\nissues for the future not only in the context of the more classical form of tangible property \n\nsuch as minerals but also intangible property such as orbital slots on the geostationary \n\norbit, frequencies, etc.\u201d \n\n\n\n 63 \n\nOnly with clear and precise legal answers to these primary questions might there \n\nsurface an element of stability, without which the construction of any organization is \n\nimpossible, and therefore the construction of any future. Transferred from one earthly \n\nreality dominated by territorial and tangible dimensions, we are now involved in a spatial \n\nreality dominated by apparent emptiness and the intangible. Although within an \n\nenvironment that is strange and cannot be 'comprehended' by our senses, the ability to \n\nexplore new resources and carry out activities that open new possibilities on Earth created \n\nthe need to internally organize our relationships concerning the use of these new \n\nintangible spaces; therefore the classical questions arise again, with new variations. \n\nThe possibility to regulate the use of certain goods involves the ability to first describe, \n\nmeasure, locate and name them, and then to classify them. In other words, in order to \n\nregulate the use of a certain good, we have to have defined it. \n\nThe legitimacy of a theoretical construction always depends on its explanatory \n\ncapacity of reality. In Space, unlike on Earth, the classification of any legal regime should \n\ntake as its starting point the reality of the intrinsic characteristics of the goods and not a \n\nprevious theoretical construction later applied to the goods in question. This process, \n\nwhose initial impulse is the well-known reality, was similar to the approach carried out \n\nby Roman law, which therefore continues to be used in Space today. According to \n\nOosterlinck (1996:2), \u201cUnder Roman Law, \u2018Res\u2019, or things, are classified into res \n\ncorporals and res incorporales\u201d. It was in the Roman legal system where the \u201cemptiness\u201d \n\nof space found a concept (res incorporales) to explain the new reality of the areas in \n\nouter space or langrangian points, orbits including specific slots of certain orbits, \n\ntrajectories and to certain extended frequency spectrum. But even so, \u201cWithin res \n\ncorporals a certain number of things are excluded from trade \u2018res quarum commercium \n\nnon est\u2019, normally referred to res extra commercium\u201d. That is, there are other features \n\nregarding the nature of the good itself that makes its trading impossible, and are essential \n\nelements in the definition of the legal regime. \n\nThis qualitative approach of Roman law differs immediately from the current approach \n\nof monistic simplification, which is merely spatial/geographic, between the things that \n\nare within the territory of states and those that are outside the jurisdiction of states. \n\nFor Roman law, the res communis omnium are available to all and cannot be owned \n\nby anyone, not even by a state; for example, the air, rain and flowing river water, the sea \n\nand shore. Therefore, the origin of the res communis omnium was not one territorial \n\n\n\n 64 \n\ndivision, an abstract criterion where the common is only the part remaining after \n\nappropriations; the good\u2019s intrinsic qualities led to the classification of its legal status. \n\nIt is very interesting to note the distinction between source and resource in the analysis \n\nof the Roman legal system and the constraints that this distinction imposes on the use and \n\nexercise of property. In practice, the Romans looked differently upon the issue when \n\nconsidering the sea as a whole and when considering its constituents. In the former case, \n\nthey qualified it res communis omnium and the latter res nullius. Or, in more general \n\nterms, \u201cres communis differs from res nullius in that the source of resources cannot be \n\nappropriated but the resources themselves are amenable to appropriation. (\u2026) Res nullius \n\nmay be subject to appropriation through effective occupation and the will expressed by \n\nthe (new) owner to exercise ownership (corpore et animo)\u201d (Oosterlinck 1996:2). The \n\nintrinsic quality of the good and the possibility of its effective possession, to acquire \n\nownership, were decisive in the classification of the regime applied to it. \n\nThe \u201cocean the whole\u201d was the source, which by its very nature was inappropriable, \n\nand the fish in it one appropriable resource. The fact that it is inappropriable and common \n\nto all, and therefore global, does not necessarily mean that it doesn\u2019t exist or that some of \n\nits constituents may be physically appropriable.  \n\nThat being said, another crucial problem in defining the use and ownership regime was \n\nthe feature of inexhaustibility.  \n\nThese resources were looked at as inexhaustible and their appropriation was \n\nphysically possible and would moreover only be partial, leaving thus the possibility \n\nto others for future exploitation and use of the sea. Hugo Grotius evokes however, \n\nthough briefly, the possibility that fish could be an exhaustible resource of the sea \n\nbut in his view this would not alter the legal status of the sea as a whole. \n\n(Oosterlinck 1996:3)  \n\n(\u2026) if it were possible to prohibit any of these things, say for example, fishing, for \n\nin a way it can be maintained that fish are exhaustible, still it would not be possible \n\nto prohibit navigation, for the sea would not exhausted by that use. (Grotius 1916) \n\nTherefore, in summary, we can pose some questions that are central in determining \n\nproperty regimes: the possibility to appropriate the good or otherwise; if the good has an \n\nin- or exhaustible character, or better yet, if the use of the good, without a physical \n\nappropriation of it, may or may not lead to the exhaustion of it. Throughout the article, \n\n\n\n 65 \n\nthe author, using a theoretical analogy between ocean and space, between source and \n\nresource, analyses the existing legal regime and the options whose, in his opinion, \n\nperformance is still required in the organization of the use of this new frontier where \n\nnatural intangible resources are also limited (as in the spectrum of frequencies or the \n\ngeostationary orbit). As in all areas in which the law has been called into action, a precise \n\nclarification of the various types of ownership is needed in space too, in order to organize \n\nthe relationships established around the use of sources and resources, which, by being \n\nexhaustible, cannot be used according to a free-access regime. \n\nSynthesizing the previous analysis: \n\n \n\n1) Roman law distinguishes between the source that is not appropriable and the \n\nresource that can be physically appropriated; \n\n2) Grotius analyses the exhaustible or inexhaustible character, which is decisive \n\nin defining the ownership regime, access or use of the good; \n\n3) There are some uses of the good, although not corresponding to a physical \n\nappropriation, that can lead to its exhaustion; and \n\n4) In the outer space law, intangible property is not only confined to human \n\nintellectual property.  \n\n \n\nBased on this summary, we realize that there are also natural intangible resources in \n\nthe Earth System that can be exhausted by some uses, although they can escape our \n\nsenses.  \n\nWith climate change and the discovery that a stable climate is not an inexhaustible \n\nfactor, that is, the incorporales biogeophysical conditions that determine the state of the \n\nEarth System have upper and lower limits and therefore are exhaustible, the \u201cownership\u201d \n\nof this resource is not realized through a physical occupation but rather through its use, \n\ni.e., as a change in the qualitative state of its incorporeal characteristics. \n\nOne should consider the recent period of relative climate stability corresponding to the \n\nHolocene (the last 11,700 years after the last ice age), which has been the basis for the \n\ndevelopment of human civilizations (the history of the human species corresponds to a \n\nperiod of about 200,000 years), as a particularly favourable state of the Earth System for \n\nour species and for others that share the same ecological conditions. Every time a state, \n\ncompany or an individual contributes to a change in the biogeochemical conditions of \n\nthis period of stability, which has benefited all humankind, an \u201cexternality\u201d in the natural \n\n\n\n 66 \n\nres incorporales is generated, affecting all other users of this favourable state as less \n\nresource (considering the stable state of the Earth System as a resource) will be available \n\nto all agents. \n\nThe biogeochemical conditions that ensure a stable climate and the favourable \n\nconditions of the Holocene are a natural intangible limited resource on Earth. The \n\nfavourable conditions of the Holocene arose in an evolutionary fashion throughout Earth's \n\nhistory and it is through this evolutionary process involving the living part of the planet \n\nas well as the geophysical that, for example, the relative concentrations of gases have \n\nremained relatively constant through time. In essence, it is the integration of the \n\ngeophysical properties of the planet with the living biosphere that forms the intangible \n\nEarth System, a single global system incapable of any legal abstraction of division. \n\nIn the source/resource Roman law perspective of analysis, the source of this favourable \n\nstate was the living biosphere and its interactions with the geophysical components. In \n\nother words, the sources are the ecological infrastructures, and the resource the \n\nbiogeochemical conditions of the state of the Earth System. \n\nWe have been exploiting a vital resource we did not even know existed; nor did we \n\nknow if it was exhaustible or inexhaustible. The stable climate was, quite simply, a pre-\n\nacquired data. The possibility of it being affected by human activity was a hypothesis that \n\ndid not even arise. The only value we truly recognized was in the sources of this unknown \n\nglobal resource, which was the primary activator of their massive destruction (for \n\nexample, more than 80% of the original forests). This is a new situation in regard to its \n\npossible classification. First, the natural resource is intangible and as such is not \n\nphysically appropriated. Second, this good does not recognize land, air or ocean borders. \n\nIt refers to a specific biochemical structure of the atmosphere and of the oceans, and its \n\nintegration with the geophysical properties of the planet with the living biosphere that \n\nforms the intangible Earth System. In this respect, taking into account their characteristics \n\nand the ways in which these res incorporales were being perceived over time, we can \n\nidentify some similar elements in four possible categories: \n\n \n\n1) Terra Incognita: The intangible higher level of integration of the Earth \n\nSystem, because it was unknown, can be considered a true terra incognita, an \n\n\u201cunknown space\u201d, traditionally defined as regions never mapped or documented. \n\n2) Res Nullius:  The change in the biochemical structure at the higher level \n\nof the Earth System can be considered to have been carried out under the open-\n\n\n\n 67 \n\naccess regime condition, without rules, and in this sense is a res nullius. A good, \n\nbeing a res incorporales and an unknown resource, is not suited to traditional \n\neffective occupation, that is, a conscious will to ownership (corpore e animo). \n\nHowever, its use can lead to its exhaustion. \n\n3) Terra Nullius: In the Middle Ages, terra nullius was used to define \n\nunclaimed or unoccupied territories, usually situated between fiefdoms and used \n\nas dumps for garbage and deposits. Although intangible and non-territorial, the \n\nfact that pollution legally disappears in the legal inexistence of the Earth System \n\nallows us to consider it as a no-man's land, as the place to send waste, and \n\ntherefore an externality. \n\n4) Res Communis Omnium: The Earth System is available to all and cannot \n\nbe appropriated by anyone, not even by a state. When this common property \n\nextends to all humankind, the goods come to be considered as res omnium. They \n\nare the common heritage of humankind so all human beings, both the present and \n\nfuture generations, have the right to access them in a favourable state. However, \n\ngiven its character as an exhaustible resource, it is necessary to create a legal \n\nframework for both the use and the benefits realized in the common good. \n\n \n\n3.2. Legal Black Hole \n\n \n\nThe \u201cglobal\u201d is therefore a new reality that is outside the legal frameworks built to \n\ndate. Within existing classifications, although we can find some elements that partially \n\nadapt to this new reality, there is no legal asset that is simultaneously global and res \n\nincorporales with the ability to reflect the harmful changes of the biochemical structure \n\nof this favourable state of the Earth System. In the same manner, there is no way to capture \n\nor account for the benefits provided by ecosystems in the maintenance of a favourable \n\nstate and enjoyed by all on a global scale. This new reality, already accepted and \n\nrecognized by science and clearly visible from space, still remains invisible to the law. \n\nIf we take as a starting point the current prevailing view that the common is not by its \n\nnature truly common but what remains after appropriation, and if to this view we join the \n\nlegal invisibility of the higher level of the Earth System as a whole, what remains is not \n\na terra incognita but truly an incognita sine terra. \n\n\n\n 68 \n\nTerra incognita was the term used in the 15th and 16th centuries to mark unknown \n\nland \u2013 the regions that had never been mapped or documented. After terra incognita had \n\ndisappeared from our maps and the planet had \u201cbecome spherical\u201d, where one could go \n\nback to the point of origin without going backwards, a first major step was taken towards \n\nrealizing the overall unity of the planet at the geographical level of integration. We had, \n\nhowever, to wait until almost the end of the 20th century to realize that the planet and its \n\noperating system had more than a well-defined geographical, physical and palpable \n\ndimension. A new reality was revealed when we discovered that the gases and substances \n\nemitted into the atmosphere not only did not disappear in space but were also \n\ninterchanged with the land and the oceans, or that what was released into the sea did not \n\ndisappear into an ocean of infinity. Step by step, science was uncovering the upper level \n\nof integration of an Earth System with global and complex interconnections that were \n\ndifficult to observe and define. However, despite their intangible and systemic nature, \n\nthese relationships are not an abstract abstraction. Although this higher level of \n\nintegration requires an abstraction to be considered as such and also explained, it is \n\nnonetheless incredibly obvious, based in res incorporales, that we are talking about a real \n\nworld that everyone and everything is part of. \n\nAccording to  Melot &amp; P\u00e9lisse (2008) we can say that, the Earth System is still \n\nconsidered to be an unidentified legal object \u2013resulting in a large legal black hole through \n\nwhich vital positive flows (benefits to the state of the Earth System) and negative flows \n\n(harm to the state of the Earth System) \u201cdisappear\u201d as externalities. If the principle of \n\ndisjunction in natural sciences \u201chid everything which connects, interacts, and interferes\u201d \n\nin law, the paradigm of division \u201cmade believe that the arbitrary cut of the real was the \n\nreal itself\u201d (Morin 1990:17). The concept of a \u201csystem\u201d emphasises the concept of the \n\nmedium, that is, not only the physis as a material basis but also a mediation mechanism \n\nof biogeochemical cycles and thermodynamics \u201cin which reciprocal interactions inside \n\nthe system between the framework and its processes contribute to the regulation of \n\ndynamics and the maintenance of their organization, in particular thanks to feedback \n\nphenomena\u201d (L\u00e9v\u00eaque 2002:40). This enables a well-defined characteristic functioning \n\nas a single global complex ecosystem, which in reality is a life- support system for the \n\nentire biosphere, including humans, on Earth. Of course, the biosphere itself is a critical \n\npart of the Earth System, fully integrated with the geophysical components of the system \n\nitself. \n\n\n\n 69 \n\nThe legal inexistence of the favourable state of the Earth System as an object of law \n\nis a structural problem that hides the most vital factors for human life and prevents the \n\nconstruction of just and equitable solutions. \n\nIt is this vision that considers as remaining and res nullius everything that does not fit \n\nthe concept of national sovereignty, which turns us into true free riders of the Earth \n\nSystem to which we belong and depend on, opening the doors for a collective tragedy. \n\n \n\n3.3. The Greatest Market Failure \n\n \n\nWhile it is true that it is materially or legally impossible to deny any human being free \n\naccess to use of the Earth System, the enjoyment of truly common goods without any \n\neffective rules means that each individual is compelled to indefinitely increase his/her use \n\nof common resources associated with a particular state of the Earth System (e.g., the \n\natmosphere with a particular concentration of constituent gases) because, if one does not \n\ndo it, others will. All users have an incentive to increase their use without concern for the \n\nimpact their actions may have on others (and perhaps themselves), and a disincentive in \n\npromoting the maintenance and improvement of the common good. \n\nThis is the well-known tragedy of the commons model described by Hardin (1968), in \n\nwhich free and unregulated use of a common resource based on the logic of first-come, \n\nfirst-served results in a rational actor maximizing individual interest. This places the \n\ncommon resource under such pressure that it becomes degraded and eventually exhausted \n\nas a result of overexploitation, thus the \u201ctragedy\u201d. The dilemma is that if a user retracts \n\nhis/her use and the others do not, the resource will run out in the same way and the user \n\nwill have lost the short-term benefit that was obtained by others. \n\nThe model is now being reproduced on a global scale, with the difference that the good \n\n(resource) was until recently unknown and not definable. In this global-scale model, each \n\nstate, following its own interest, will not be concerned about limiting pollution or \n\nmaintaining its ecosystems for the purpose of contributing to a well-functioning Earth \n\nSystem in a stable and accommodating state, as the good is freely available to be exploited \n\nby all. As there is no legal status for the global good, everyone uses it as res nullius, \n\nconsidering it will provide an endless stream of benefits to everyone, where their use does \n\nnot reduce the potential for use by others (contrary to what is true of the commons). \n\n\n\n 70 \n\nIncidentally, this legal black hole has also been identified by economists in the Stern \n\nReport: \n\nClimate change presents a unique challenge for economics: it is the greatest and \n\nwidest-ranging market failure ever seen. The economic analysis must therefore be \n\nglobal, deal with long-term horizons, have the economics of risk and uncertainty at \n\ncentre stage, and examine the possibility of major, non-marginal change. (Stern \n\n2006:11) \n\nThe failure to recognize the existence of the Earth System makes nations unable to \n\ncope with the challenges on a planetary scale. One consequence is that all the benefits \n\nfrom, or damages to, the Earth System are legally non-existent. Without the existence of \n\nthis common good or the identification of what is the good that presents simultaneously \n\nbeyond and within all states but is required to be maintained in good condition for the \n\nfunctioning of the Earth System as a whole, we will not be able to turn ourselves into \n\nstewards of our common home. An Earth System that does not exist is a matricial failure \n\nand theoretical gap, which prevents filling the void that this recently recognized scientific \n\nreality requires. \n\n \n\n3.4. Global Free Riders... Get It While You Can \n\n \n\nAt the heart of this problem are deep theoretical concepts that require some prior \n\nconceptual clarification on the characteristics of property, property rights and underlying \n\nrelations. Since human relations expanded on a global scale through global systemic \n\nfinancial, economic and political interconnections (but ignored the biogeophysical \n\ninterconnections that underpin the functioning of the Earth System), it is essential to \n\nrealize how some of these principles of law led to the overexploitation and consequent \n\ntragedy of the commons. \n\nThe right of private property confers to its owner the power to exclusively use a \n\nresource, even if such use is rarely done absolutely. This means that, even though an \n\nowner has full power over something plena in re potestas, meaning the right to use, enjoy \n\nand abuse a thing, ius utendi, fruendi et abutendi res sua means that he or she is limited \n\nby the rules of society. \n\n\n\n 71 \n\nRights to common property are held by groups of individuals, excluding access to the \n\nresources for all those outside the group, but considering rights and duties regarding the \n\nuse and conservation of the resource. \n\nThe open-access regime (res nullius), the concept of ownerless property, is completely \n\nnon-exclusive, meaning that the access to goods/resources cannot be denied to any \n\nindividual. In these cases, one cannot identify a group of users or owners because the \n\navailable benefits flow to all without any, or almost any, duty regarding the use, \n\npreservation or maintenance of the resource. \n\nIn economic theory, this inability to exclude any individual\u2019s use of a good led to the \n\nrise of the free rider (Samuelson 1954) issue, in which any individual can benefit from a \n\ngood without contributing to its production. An individual, following self-interest, will \n\nnot contribute to the costs of the existence and maintenance of a good but will make use \n\nof its existence since it is available to everyone. The individual benefits from the principle \n\nof non-exclusion. \n\nThe problem of the tragedy of commons is based on the characteristics of free access \n\nand the unregulated use of a natural resource, which is limited by nature. Climate change \n\nis a tragedy of the commons on a global scale, in which this intrinsically common good, \n\nwhich was overexploited (a characteristic stable climate of a well-defined state of the \n\nEarth System), is not only difficult to define and to establish boundaries around but also \n\nno human being can be excluded from access to it. \n\nIn a situation where either the damage or the benefits are common, without an \n\norganization of collective use through a system of accounting benefits and harms, \n\neveryone will act as a global free rider. Therefore, this is a tragedy not of material \n\nresource exhaustion but of individual occupation of a certain quantity of the \n\nbiogeophysical space of the Earth System, carried out through a change that contributes \n\nto destabilising the favourable, stable state of the system. In other words, pollution is a \n\ncontribution to a change of a particular state, the healthiness of the Earth System. This \n\nnew form of occupation does not correspond to the traditional concept of territory or a \n\nphysical appropriation of tangible resources; rather the new reality must be recognized \n\nand conceptualized in order to organize the use of the Earth System. Although a \n\nsubversive perspective of the dominant view today, the indivisible \u201cwhole\u201d makes the \n\nissue of management of common goods (i.e., the Earth System) the basic fundamental \n\ntheoretical question for all discussions on global environmental goods and possible \n\nalternative ways of building a sustainable society. \n\n\n\n 72 \n\n \n\n3.5. A Long Looking-For Period \n\nWhen we look at the pathway traced by science in perspective, the history of \n\nenvironmental civil society movements and all the high-level negotiations that have been \n\ntaking place for many decades, we realize that along this route of searching for solutions, \n\nthe vision that the \u201ccommon\u201d is just the leftovers after appropriation unfortunately \n\ncontinues to be the starting point from which reality is framed. However, a great effort \n\nby the victims of this structural failure is being made and it is imperative to continue this \n\nstandard negotiations track, even accepting that progress in reaching a solution for our \n\ntroubled planet has been too slow. \n\nTen years after Rachel Carson published Silent Spring, a book that challenged the idea \n\nof the supposed capacity of the environment to absorb toxic pollutants such as agriculture \n\npesticides, the 1972 United Nations Conference on Human Environment, held in \n\nStockholm under the leadership of Maurice Strong, is a decisive mark on the \n\nsustainability timeline. While the regional pollution situation in Sweden and the \n\nsurrounding Nordic and Central European countries achieved a particular focus, it was \n\nthe first major step at the global level to give environmental issues a high priority. The \n\ncreation of a sustainable development concept, with the view of integrating different \n\nfields of development, which until that time had been fully separated into a cohesive \n\nvision solving the environmental versus development dilemma, was a clear breakthrough. \n\nLimits to Growth, by the Club of Rome, the best-selling environmental book, was \n\npublished in 1972, one year before the oil crisis. The type of analysis, interconnections \n\nand particularly the results sent a shockwave through both developed and developing \n\ncountries. The conference led to the establishment of numerous national environmental \n\nprotection agencies and, most importantly, the creation of the United Nations \n\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP). \n\nDuring the 1970s, while relevant international agreements such as the Convention on \n\nInternational Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES) in 1975 and the \n\nadoption of the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution in 1979 came \n\ninto effect, the world became acquainted with dramatic global environmental problems, \n\nincluding the discovery of the role chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) played in damaging the \n\nstratospheric ozone layer by Rowland and Molina in 1974, and catastrophes with a \n\n\n\n 73 \n\nsymbolic impact that became calls for world action like the 1978 Amoco Cadiz oil spill \n\naffecting the coast of Brittany in France.  \n\nThe \u201980s broadened the scope of international action in different areas of the \n\nenvironment. The first World Conservation Strategy was released by the International \n\nUnion for Conservation of Nature in 1980 with the significant subtitle: \u201cLiving Resource \n\nConservation for Sustainable Development\u201d. In the document\u2019s foreword, it states that \n\n\u201chuman beings (\u2026) must come to terms with the reality of resource limitation and the \n\ncarrying capacities of ecosystems, and must take into account the needs of future \n\ngenerations\u201d. At the end, the \u201cTowards Sustainable Development\u201d section identifies the \n\nmain agents of habitat destruction as poverty, population pressure, social inequity and the \n\nterms of trade, and calls for a new international development strategy. While the \n\nprinciples were not disruptive at that time, they started to frame a vision for the next \n\ndecades concerning the complex relationships between human beings and nature. \n\nThe concept of the \u2018common heritage of mankind\u2019, first mentioned in a 1954 \n\nconvention related with the protection of cultural property under armed conflicts and in \n\nthe Outer Space Treaty of 1967, achieved a greater maturity in 1982 within the United \n\nNations Law of the Sea Treaty. \n\nIn 1987, the publication of Our Common Future, or the so-called Brundtland Report, \n\ngave a comprehensive vision of the problems affecting the planet and the need for global \n\nsolutions mostly through the promotion of sustainable development. \n\nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de \n\nJaneiro in 1992 was a real breakthrough. By mobilizing an incredibly larger number of \n\nstakeholders and high-level representatives from all over the globe before, during, and \n\nafter the conference, the Earth Summit or ECO/92 framed the United Nations as the \n\nunquestionable international core for further advances on the implementation of solutions \n\nfor a safer planet with a better quality of life. The publication of Agenda 21, the signature \n\nof the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Framework Convention on Climate \n\nChange, the Rio Declaration plus a statement of non-binding Forest Principles probably \n\nturned the event into the most important political mark on the sustainable development \n\ntimeline. The parallel non-governmental organization Forum also added a set of \n\nalternative strategies and visions relevant in the framing of a critical view compared to \n\nthe less ambitious, slow, and sometimes painful negotiation track along the formal venues \n\nof the United Nations. \n\n\n\n 74 \n\nThroughout the 1990s, two major challenges should be highlighted as crucial steps for \n\na better understanding of the international framework concerning sustainable \n\ndevelopment and the most important global long-term problem for humanity that is \n\nclimate change. The beginning of the Conferences of the Parties, after the entry into force \n\nof the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1995 \n\nand the further signature of the Kyoto Protocol by 1997, and all the preparatory work for \n\nthe approval of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals by 2000, where world \n\nleaders agreed to a set of time-bound and measurable goals for combating poverty, \n\nhunger, disease, illiteracy, environmental degradation and discrimination against women, \n\nto be achieved by 2015. \n\nIn 2000, after a decade of global cross-cultural dialogue on common goals and shared \n\nvalues, the Earth Charter was launched. It began as a United Nations initiative but it was \n\nthen developed through the involvement of the global civil society, currently with the \n\nendorsement of more than 6,000 organizations. The Earth Charter proposes an ethical \n\nframework for building a just, sustainable and peaceful global society for the 21st century. \n\nWith 16 principles, the Charter emphasises the need to respect and care for the community \n\nof life along the first four principles, with a statement (principle 2a) that frames a \n\nrelationship between humans and the rest of nature: \u201cAccept that with the right to own, \n\nmanage, and use natural resources comes the duty to prevent environmental harm and to \n\nprotect the rights of people.\u201d \n\nDuring the first decade of the 21st century, another paradigm should also be noted \u2013 \n\nthe relationship between the intensive work of more than 3,000 experts from the \n\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change between science and forecasted policy \n\nscenarios, and all the negotiations towards the mitigation and adaptation to climate \n\nchange, clearly deserving of the Nobel Peace Prize awarded in 2007. \n\n \n\n3.6. The Inevitable Global and Multiple Approach \n\n \n\nEven admitting that the negotiations pathway will gradually convey better \n\napproximations of a solution, the structural problem still exists, making inevitable a \n\nconfrontation where \u201csovereignty defies reality\u201d (Brunn\u00e9e 1998). This author, in a paper \n\nabout the conflicts between sovereignty and water management and the difficulties of \n\ninternational law in dealing with shared resources, states that \n\n\n\n 75 \n\n My contention is simple: International Water Law, and States, will not meet the \n\n\u201cchallenges of water\u201d until the reality of interdependence is addressed in its full \n\ncomplexity. This means that international environmental law and international \n\nwater law must become integrated to treat water for what it is: a component of the \n\nenvironment. From this integration, in turn, must emerge a concept of sovereignty \n\nthat reflects rather than defies environmental reality. \n\nWith the knowledge we have today of the Earth System, a division between the water \n\ncomponent and the other system components is not sound but the statement is still valid \n\non the need for sovereignty to reflect the environmental reality. \n\nIt has become obvious that solutions are necessary. Within the political framework \n\narchitecture of existing institutions, we must consider that without a new theoretical \n\napproach able to support a new global paradigm for the management of the commons \n\nwithin an international landscape characterised by the multiplication of territorial units, \n\nit will be impossible to avoid the effects of a congenital degeneration. \n\nIn this context, the preliminary works concerning the ecological footprint, a first \n\nquantifiable and integrated analysis at a global scale, date from the beginning of the \u201990s \n\nin the last century. It was more recently, in 2006, that the standardization of this \n\ninstrument has enabled it to evaluate and compare activities, countries and regions \n\nworldwide. The ecological footprint enables us to measure the human demand on nature \n\nand evaluate the availability of resources in a constrained world that is becoming more \n\nand more populated.  \n\nThe footprint represents both the asset side through biocapacity, the planet\u2019s renewable \n\nresources such as biologically productive land areas including our forests, pastures, \n\ncropland and fisheries, and a demand side, with humanity\u2019s consumption of natural \n\nresources. \n\nUpon reaching 2015, the target date of the Millennium Development Goals, the United \n\nNations took an important broader step, adopting in this same year the 17 sustainable \n\ndevelopment goals (SDGs). Considered a consequence of the Rio+20 outcome document \n\n\u201cThe Future We Want\u201d, an inclusive and transparent intergovernmental process on SDGs \n\nopened to all stakeholders, with a view to developing global sustainable development \n\ngoals. Ending poverty and hunger go hand in hand with the need to ensure sustainable \n\nconsumption and production patterns; take urgent action to combat climate change and \n\nits impacts; conserve and promote a sustainable use of the oceans, seas and marine \n\n\n\n 76 \n\nresources; protect, restore and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems; \n\nsustainably manage forests; combat desertification; and halt and reverse land degradation \n\nand biodiversity loss. \n\nTherefore, and with a deep description of the historical application and usefulness of \n\ntracking sustainable development, new guiding principles for assessment system \n\nindicators are suggested throughout this book. \n\nHowever, the ecological footprint does not account for certain key thresholds within \n\nour biophysical system, the so-called planetary boundaries (Steffen et al. 2015a; \n\nRockstr\u00f6m et al. 2009) that correspond to biogeophysical features of the geological period \n\nin the Holocene. This intangible structure that defines the favourable state of the Earth \n\nSystem is referred to by the scientific community as the \u201csafe operating space for \n\nhumanity\u201d, a space without territory, a true natural res incorporales that is simultaneously \n\ninside and outside all sovereignties, that through the cumulative pressure of humanity \n\nmay drive the Earth System to an undesirable state. \n\nThis new known reality, this true environmental grundnorm, therefore, should be the \n\nbasis for any positive law of general acceptance and reasonableness (Rakhyun &amp; \n\nBosselmann 2013). The ULO, unidentified legal object, (Melot &amp; P\u00e9lisse 2008), could \n\nnow have a set of parameters and guidelines that define its stability and existence. \n\nWhile science is key for evaluating the progress towards a more sustainable planet, the \n\ndaily reality embraces long worldwide negotiations, with thousands of negotiators talking \n\n(more than defining) a set of policies on multiple dimensions, including the economy, \n\nsociety, the environment, and other aspects such as governance. \n\nDeparting from the \u201ccurrent system of nation-state based governance is inadequate for \n\ntackling such issues as climate change-induced global warming, pandemic diseases and \n\nother threats to human security and prosperity\u201d2, this book conveys the idea of an Earth \n\nCondominium model, and a new global trusteeship as a paradigm shift necessary to \n\novercome the difficulties the United Nations has had in the last decades to achieve a better \n\nand planetary outcome concerning different environmental- related matters. Indeed, the \n\nperception of informed citizens worldwide is that the UN has not been able to deliver the \n\nnecessary commitments, measures and actions to tackle many of the issues agreed on \n\nwithin the sustainable development area. However, it is completely unrealistic to rapidly \n\nchange the modus operandi of this planetary institution. Even though we are far from the \n\ndesired goals, one has to recognize that the negotiations have been progressing with some \n\nrelevant achievements. The alternative to bilateral or group country agreements would \n\n\n\n 77 \n\nincrease the dictatorship of the will of a few countries, extending the already existing \n\nunnecessary divisions. \n\nIn fact, the high complexity of the climate change issue makes science and technical \n\nexpertise conveyed through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change almost as \n\ndeterminant as political will. \n\nThe extensive accumulation of negotiation knowledge and consensus, including the \n\nsignature of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, with all the accessory mechanisms including the \n\nclean development mechanism, joint implementation, and emission trading between \n\ncountries, involved a huge process of approval, tracking, and monitoring that is not \n\ncommon to other UN conventions. \n\nThe pathway where long-frozen concepts, such as the so-called \u201cfirewall\u201d that has \n\nbeen dividing countries into two major groups \u2013 developed and the developing, which \n\nhave been questioned since greenhouse gas emission targets have had to be applied to a \n\nmuch larger number of countries in the post-2020 era, is a paradigm of crucial importance \n\nthat the negotiations are trying to finally overcome. \n\nThe future has to incorporate a combination of strategies, where champion countries \n\nhave to lead the way and engage other countries, and where multilateral negotiations have \n\nto unfold and at least partially meet the objectives considered necessary for the \n\nminimization of impacts on humanity and ecosystems. Simultaneously, a new legal \n\nparadigm where the \u201ccommons\u201d are the basis of a new configuration of the relationships \n\nbetween the countries is vital, and should be implemented within a medium or long-term \n\nperspective in a parallel but active process that should start as soon as possible. A \n\npragmatic perspective would be the one that takes into account the current real politic but \n\nat the same time acknowledges the huge theoretical challenge to law to convey a \n\nfavourable state of \u201chealthiness\u201d of the Earth System which it is not restricted to the \n\nglobal commons but also spans across areas subject to national jurisdiction (Borg 2007). \n\nA complementary strategy that does not stop or close the ongoing negotiation \n\nprocesses but shifts and integrates them within a new conceptual framework is the \n\nchallenge embraced by this book. Only a truly accepted agreement can be both binding \n\nand implemented and, therefore, successful. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 78 \n\n3.7. The Double Tragedy and Double Challenge \n\n \n\nThe work of Hardin generated pessimism around the \u201ccommon\u201d, turning common \n\nproperty management into a failure. The failure deepens when even those who genuinely \n\ncare about future sustainability and the common good come to the conclusion that the \n\nrestriction of exploitation of the resource will lead to a comparative economic loss. This \n\nis an altruistic feeling that will lead to a self-elimination of the agents, resulting from a \n\nnatural selection process. This logic is valid not only for the exploitation of the resource \n\nbut also applies to the benefits that can be realized in maintaining/improving the common \n\ngood. \n\nIn the context of the Earth System, one can designate the current situation as a dual \n\ntragedy: \n\nOn one hand, the classical tragedy of exploitation embodied in the destabilisation \n\nof the relatively stable Holocene state of the Earth System by unregulated resource \n\nexploitation and pollution; \n\nOn the other hand, and using the Roman Source/resource analysis, as no country \n\nwill enjoy just for itself all the benefits provided from its own sources of the \n\nresource (ecological/geophysical infrastructure) in the state of Earth System \n\n(common resource), there are no advantages in promoting actions to maintain the \n\nEarth System in a stable state. As there is no incentive for individual initiatives to \n\nmaintain or improve the sources of common good, in the context of competition \n\nand legal and economic shortcomings in managing a common resource, it is normal \n\nto allow the degradation of the sources to sell raw materials or to obtain other \n\neconomic gains, since the vital benefits provided by the sources of the common \n\nresource are worth zero as they are still shared by all on a global scale. \n\nThe logic of the tragedy of the commons is doubly valid for the exhaustion of the \n\nresource and for the destruction of the sources of the resource, \u201cthe ecological \n\ninfrastructure\u201d that can deliver benefits to all societies. The short-term logic will prevail \n\nunless structural measures that have the ability to change these initial conditions and \n\ngenerate new systemic collaborative effects are implemented. The logic of the tragedy of \n\nthe commons undoubtedly depends on a set of assumptions related to the motivation of \n\n\n\n 79 \n\npeople operating under rules governing the use of the common and defining the very \n\nnature of the resource. \n\nA pragmatic approach to this dual challenge has to be necessarily innovative. This \n\nimplies a structural intervention in the framework basics of the sovereign international \n\nsystem, which allows the benefits achieved in the state of the Earth System, which \n\ncurrently economically disappear into a black legal hole, to have economic visibility \n\nthrough an accounting system and compensation for the \u201cstewardship of the Earth \n\nSystem\u201d. For this structural change to become possible, it is necessary that the global \n\nbenefits made by the \u201ccommon resource\u201d, which is the Earth System in a favourable state, \n\nare caught in a global legal instrument. \n\n \n\nFigure 4. A comparison of the existing and proposed Earth System \n\nmanagement regimes \n\n \n\nWith the work of Elinor Ostrom and the recognition of the Nobel Prize awarded to her, \n\nthe commons are no longer an impossibility. For Ostrom (2010:28) \u201cthe crucial factor \n\nwill be a combination of structural features that lead many involved to trust each other, \n\nand are willing to take joint action that adds value to their own short-term costs because \n\nboth see a long-term benefit for themselves and others, believing that most others will \n\ncomply\u201d. This building of trust and reciprocity, as she claims, requires structural features. \n\nWe argue that the first structural feature in organizing the collective use of a common \n\nresource is to define the resource to be managed, and to recognize that it has to exist. \n\nNO OBJECT\nFOR GLOBAL\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nLEGAL INVISIBILITY\nOF ECOSYSTEM \n\nSERVICES \n\nNO INSTITUCIONAL EXISTENCE\n\nNO COORDINATION\n\nLEGAL INVISIBILITY  OF \nINTERCONECTIONS\nAND EMERGENCE\nPHENOMENA\n\nINCENTIVE \nTO EXPLOIT\nTHE EARTH SYSTEM\n\nEARTH SYSTEM AS RES NULLIUS\n\nTRAGEDY OF COMMONS\n\nLEGAL INVISIBILITY OF \nHUMANITY AND\n\nFUTURE  GENERATIONS\n\nVITAL FACTORS \n\nAS EXTERNALITIES\n\nNEGATIVE IMPACTS\n\nAS EXTERNALITIES\n\nEARTH SYSTEM AS\n\nINTANGIBLE \nCOMMON \nHERITAGE\nOF HUMANKIND\n\nINSTITUCIONAL \nCOORDINATION OF \nTHE EARTH SYSTEM USE\n\nSYSTEMIC APPROACH\n\nINCENTIVE \nTO REDUCE \nEXPLOITATION AND \nTO RESTORE\nTHE EARTH SYSTEM\n\nVALORIZATION\nBENEFITS ON THE EARTH \n\nSYSTEM STATE\n\nACCOUNTING\nNEGATIVE\n\nCONTRIBUTIONS\n\n             LEGAL VISIBILITY OF\n             HUMANITY AND FUTURE  \n             GENERATIONS THROUGH \n                    THE COMMON \n                       HERITAGE\n\nACCOUNTING SYSTEM\nMANAGEMENT\n\nCAPTURE OF \nBENEFITS ON \n\nTHE COMMON \n\nHERITAGE\n\n WITHOUT LEGAL  EXISTENCE  WITH LEGAL  EXISTENCE\n\n\n\n 80 \n\nOnce identified, the natural res incorporales state of the Earth System, although \n\nphysically inappropriable can be managed.

A crisis can be a real \nblessing to any person, to any nation. For all crises bring progress. Creativity is born from anguish, \njust like the day is born from the dark night. It\u2019s in crisis that inventiveness is born, as well as \ndiscoveries are made and big strategies are created. He who overcomes crisis, overcomes himself, \nwithout getting overcome. He who blames his failure on a crisis neglects his own talent and is more \ninterested in problems than in solutions. Incompetence is the true crisis. The greatest inconvenience \nof people and nations is the laziness with which they attempt to find the solutions to their problems. \nThere\u2019s no challenge without a crisis. Without challenges, life becomes a routine, a slow agony. \nThere\u2019s no merit without crisis. It\u2019s in the crisis where we can show the very best in us. Without a \ncrisis, any wind becomes a tender touch. To speak about a crisis is to promote it. Not to speak about \nit is to exalt conformism. Let us work hard instead. Let us stop, once and for all, the menacing crisis \nthat represents the tragedy of not being willing to overcome it. \n\n Albert Einstein \n\n \n\n4.1. A Theoretical Gap \n\n \nAccording to Nietzsche, \"There are no facts, only interpretations\". This means that \n\nknowledge of facts is no substitute for their comprehension. \n\nThe exponential increase in the knowledge about the Earth System does not \n\nnecessarily mean we understand it in all its dimensions, particularly in terms of all the \n\nconsequences this new reality entails. Still, albeit somewhat unconsciously, the increasing \n\nability to intervene and change the state of the Earth System as a whole is moving us from \n\nthe role of passive spectators towards actors capable of changing the plot itself. We are \n\nnow in the driving seat (Rockstr\u00f6m 2014), but it seems that despite having access to the \n\ncommand centre, we don't have a social organization to define who and how to use the \n\n\u201ccentral computer\u201d (Matos 2016:28) that would allow us to conduct our own behaviour \n\nin respect of Spaceship Earth (Fuller 1969). \n\nIf from a technological perspective we are able to overcome and manipulate Spaceship \n\nEarth at all levels, the crew doesn't have the internal organization that allows collective \n\n\n\n 82 \n\naction to handle its operation. We have never been so vulnerable with respect to the level \n\nof social organization. \n\nIn nature, where more remains hidden than is revealed, the unexplainable \u201cwhole\u201d that \n\nsurrounds us has been delineated by sets of rites, myths, beliefs and concepts that \n\nestablished order amongst ideas and name the unnameable: Mother Nature, Mother \n\nEarth, the Great Machine, goddess Gaia, the law of nature, living space, ecological \n\nspace, life-support system. They are all forms for what we today call the Earth System. \n\nThroughout the history of science, properties and behaviours of different components \n\nof the Earth System have been analysed on different physical, material and biological \n\nlevels. However, the higher, more intangible and diffuse levels of interconnection and \n\nglobal systemic integration remained in our mental sphere, hidden as the true terra \n\nincognita. Even if laboratory analyses allow us to interpret the unseen and incorporeal \n\ncharacter of natural phenomena, a problem arises with the attempt to comprehend them \n\non a global scale, integrated within the true system, the \u201cwhole\u201d. For example, carbon \n\ndioxide (CO2) and its role in the biochemical process of photosynthesis are well known, \n\nbut its effects at higher concentrations in the atmosphere and the consequences of its \n\ninteraction with other elements were perceived only recently. Neither the \u201cglobal\u201d nor the \n\n\u201cwhole\u201d fit in any laboratory or suit the process of delimitation and precision required by \n\nlegal norms. \n\nFirst, human activity operates at the lower level of the Earth System (material, \n\nphysical, biological), that is, at the level of exploitation of resources and ecological \n\ninfrastructure. It not only disturbs the dynamics and interdependencies at the level of \n\nactivity but also at a higher level of the Earth System, provoking chemical changes in the \n\natmosphere and hydrosphere, initiating a process of manipulation of the pattern of order. \n\nSo, for the first time, anthropogenic impacts affected the Earth System as a whole, \n\nregardless of whether they happened at only the lower level of the Earth System. The \n\nunified and interdependent character, and the properties of the global system, began to \n\nunravel through the feedback from the higher levels of integration of the Earth System. \n\nThat initiated an interpretation of the laws of the \u201cwhole\u201d which could not be understood \n\nfrom the behaviour of its components only. \n\nIn fact, the \u2018whole\u2019 is organized from the molecule up to the biosphere, and at each \n\nlevel of integration, characteristics emerge which cannot be analysed based only on \n\nmechanisms that explain lower levels of integration. This phenomenon, known as \n\n\n\n 83 \n\nemergence, corresponds to the appearance of new characteristics at combined levels \n\nand which do not exist at the level of its constituting elements. (Filipe, Coelho &amp; \n\nFerreira 2007:125) \n\nThe characteristic behaviour of the whole cannot be derived, even in theory, from the \n\nmost complete possible knowledge of the behaviour of its components, whether \n\nconsidered individually or in other combined proportions or organizations. \n\nEmergence can also be seen as a process in which \u201cspontaneous\u201d order is displayed \n\nfrom within the system. It is when different elements are allowed to combine, that \n\nthey form patterns and interactions between them. When they lose their established \n\nrational order, entering into a situation of unstructured chaos, a new structure may \n\nemerge. (Miller &amp; Swinney 2001:22) \n\nThe Earth System is a complex one within which there are different levels of \n\nfunctioning and interaction. The pattern resulting from millennia of slow interactions \n\nbetween the various components of the Earth System produced a biochemical structure \n\ncorresponding to a single period of climate stability: the Holocene. This spontaneous \n\nemergence of an order produced emergent phenomena that contributed equally to the \n\nconsolidation of that pattern of a well-buffered stability that works inside an \u201cenvelope \n\nof natural variability\u201d (Steffen et al. 2004:336). These reciprocal interactions of \n\nteleconnections, retroactions and feedbacks led to a complex and dialectical system, \n\nwhich resulted in a favourable condition for the development of human civilizations. \n\nThe number of such phenomena is immense, and only by an analysis of the \n\ninterconnections on a global scale can we begin to lift the veil of their incredible \n\ncomplexity. One of the most interesting phenomena, in that by its domino effect it could \n\nbe a determining factor in maintaining the current state of the Earth System, is the \n\ntransport of dust between the Sahara and Amazon (NASA &amp; Garner 2015). From the \n\nSahara desert and, with more intensity, the Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 Depression in Chad, an ancient lake \n\nrockbed composed of dead microorganisms loaded with phosphorus, around 182 million \n\ntons (the equivalent of 689,290 semi-trucks full) of dust are transported each year by the \n\nwind, travelling 1,600 miles across the Atlantic, though some drops to the surface or is \n\nflushed from the sky by rain. \n\nNear the eastern coast of South America, at longitude 35W, 132 million tons remain \n\nin the air, and 27.7 million tons (enough to fill 104,908 semi-trucks) fall to the surface \n\n\n\n 84 \n\nover the Amazon basin. It fertilises the basin decisively, maintaining that dense green \n\nmass, which, in turn, with its 600 billion trees and an extraordinary sophisticated process, \n\npumps 20 billion tons of water daily into the atmosphere (larger trees pump about 1000 \n\nlitres/day of water), and injects 17 billion cubic metres of water containing a high \n\nconcentration of organic matter into the ocean (one-fifth of all the fresh water that reaches \n\nthe oceans). Amazingly, deserts are crucial to life in the oceans and global climate \n\nregulation. With this dialectic chain of emergences, we realize the interdependent whole \n\nof the entire system. In its higher level of integration, as stated by Hongbin Yu,5 \u201cThis is \n\na small world \u2026 we're all connected together\u201d. \n\nOnly recently has visualizing this example become possible, allowing us to \n\ncomprehend the unimaginable potential chain of interconnections and teleconnections on \n\nwhich we depend, and that we are influencing by inducing changes in the preconditions \n\nthat maintain the status of the system. \n\nThe changes in some of the initial conditions in the pattern of stability in the system \n\ncorresponding with the Holocene period, for example the increase in CO2 concentrations \n\n(and consequent changes in heat accumulation, global thermodynamics and feedbacks \n\nproduced by climate change), allowed us to \u201copen the book\u201d on the dynamics and \n\ninterdependencies that occur at the higher level of the Earth System.  \n\nThe Great Acceleration3 by the human enterprise started in the middle of the twentieth \n\ncentury with an increase in the exploitation of resources and ecological infrastructures \u2013 \n\n\u201cThe speeding up of just about everything after the Second World War \u2026 sometimes \n\ncalled the Great Acceleration\u2026 human population has tripled, but the global economy \n\nand material consumption have grown many times faster\u201d (Hibbard et al. 2006:342). It \n\ncreated such fundamental changes in the state and functioning of the Earth System that it \n\nis designated as the end date for the Holocene period and the start date for the \n\nAnthropocene. \n\nThe tsunami caused by the changes in the dynamic natural pattern is overwhelming \n\nthe social and economic systems to such an extent that it calls for a questioning and re-\n\nevaluation of many of the fundamental ideas upon which the Great Acceleration was built. \n\nAlthough urgent, we have not yet been able to go the required distance from which to \n\n                                                \n5 Hongbin Yu, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Maryland who works at NASA's Goddard Space Flight \nCenter in Greenbelt, Maryland, is lead author of the study about dust transport, with data collected by a lidar \ninstrument on NASA's Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation, or CALIPSO, satellite from \n2007 through 2013. \n\n\n\n 85 \n\nperform a critical analysis of these facts, their scientific interpretation, and their \n\nimplications for international relations and the social, political and economic realms. \n\nAlthough restricted to an academic level, the discussion on the de-territorialised and \n\nglobalised reality in which we now live has created a situation in which everything is \n\nbeing questioned. Garcia (2010:15), in her analysis about the fragmentation of the state \n\nsovereignty, identified many authors who address this issue: \n\nThere are authors who question whether we need to abandon the concept of the \n\nState (Heiko Faber), those that claim that the Modern State has ceased to exist \n\n(Wolfgang Reinhold), those who ask \u201cwhy do we still talk of the State?\u201d (Peter \n\nSaladin), or those who claim that there is an incompatibility between globalisation \n\nand sovereign States (Thomas Vesting). There are even those who assert that the \n\nnational State no longer guarantees peace, freedom, security, protection of human \n\nrights and the environment (Julianne Kokott). \n\nRuggie (1993:139) argues that scholars of international relations are not very good ... \n\nat studying the possibility of fundamental discontinuity in the international system; that \n\nis, at addressing the question of whether the modern system of States may be yielding in \n\nsome instances to post-modern forms of congaing political space. We lack even an \n\nadequate vocabulary; and what we cannot describe, we cannot explain. \n\nIn a fully globalised world, connected through biophysical interactions between people \n\nand nations at social and economic levels, several fundamental premises of the \n\nWestphalian system of sovereign states have changed. The change is so deep that even \n\nwords, until today unquestionable in the description of these situations, such as the word \n\n\u201cinternational\u201d, have become obsolete in the attempt to capture the totality of social \n\nrelations that cross the boundaries of states. \n\nThe growing importance of non-State actors involved in social interactions beyond \n\nState boundaries, regional and global structures, and the improvement in the efficiency \n\nof international norms, resulted in terms such as \u201ctransnationalism\u201d and \u201cglobalism\u201d. \n\nThese new terms are responses to the inadequacy of the term 'international' to depict \n\nobserved empirical phenomena, making the 'international' an unsatisfactory analytical (or \n\nindeed epistemological) category to describe global society. Thus understood, the \n\n'international' might be seen as a description of social structures that have lost much of \n\ntheir relevance in the wake of increasing de-nationalisation through trans-nationalisation \n\nor globalisation. (Albert 2007:48) \n\n\n\n 86 \n\nDisturbances we create in the pattern of Holocene stability, combined with the new \n\ntechnologies available, make visible the higher level of integration of the Earth System. \n\nThe awareness of this new reality and the knowledge of the consequences created the new \n\nglobalised context, where everything changes. It is even normal to resort to \u201cproblem \n\nwords\u201d (Morin 2007) and not \u201csolution words\u201d, as in the case of the word \u201ccomplexity\u201d. \n\nIn this sense, several authors resort to \u201ccomplex sovereignty\u201d (Magalh\u00e3es 2007:88; Pauly \n\n&amp; Grande 2007:3) to define what otherwise could not be named in the confrontation \n\nbetween evolution of social-ecological reality and the concept of sovereignty. \n\nEdgar Morin (1990:8) explains in his \u201ccomplex thought\u201d that \u201ccomplexity cannot be \n\nreduced to a single master word, law or simple idea. In other words, the complex cannot \n\nbe reduced to a law or idea of complexity. It cannot be something easy to define, thereby \n\ntaking the place of simplicity\u201d. In other words, calling complexity \u201ccomplex\u201d does not \n\nsolve the problem with which we are confronted. \n\nEven on the short human temporal scale, the Great Acceleration was short and recent. \n\nIts feedbacks carry with them impertinent and subversive questions that pressure the \n\nexisting social system and its assumptions. Answering them implies a radical change in \n\ntheoretical perspectives. \n\nThe facts exist: the Earth System functions as an interdependent \u201cglobal whole\u201d in the \n\nway it has always functioned in its different states throughout its history \u2013 what does not \n\nyet exist is a theory able to first represent the world beyond the nation-state and then \n\nallocate a place to what is the higher level of integration of the Earth System. Since there \n\nis no interpretation capable of representing this global reality within our system of social \n\norganization, we continue to act as if that reality does not exist. \n\nNietzsche, therefore, is correct in his statement, the point here being that the legitimacy \n\nof interpretation lies in its capacity to explain reality; in other words, its ability to reflect \n\nand understand the actual situation in the world. The legitimacy of a discourse resides in \n\nthe explanatory power of reality, so that legitimacy erodes to the extent that its inadequacy \n\nto reflect the real situation in the world increases. In every area where the discourse of \n\nsovereignty has lost its ability to accurately portray the facts, it is precisely at the gap \n\nbetween theorization of reality and the actual reality of the ecological dynamic of the \n\nbiosphere that this loss of legitimacy becomes clear (Camilleri and Falk 1992). \n\nWithout a theory able to interpret the facts raised by the global and interdependent \n\nreality of the Earth System, we will continue to live an illusion that tries to fit new facts \n\ninto an old interpretation. \n\n\n\n 87 \n\nIn this context, it is no surprise that the majority of reactions to environmental \n\ndisruption caused by the Great Acceleration are limited to interventions in the periphery \n\nof the social system. We classified this \u201clooking-for period\u201d as the first generation of \n\nenvironmental law, with modest intervention in human relationships, that is, we relied on \n\nlong lists of prohibitions without intervening in the primary drivers of the system or \n\nproperly understanding the huge theoretical challenge. \n\nEven without the scientific information needed to unravel some of the contours of the \n\nnew circumstances that impose themselves on law, Amaral (1994:17) understood the \n\nstructural and systemic nature of the challenge being faced. \n\nEnvironmental law is a primary branch of law, born not to regulate the relations \n\namongst humans but to try to insert discipline in the relationship between humans \n\nand nature. ... before the eyes of humanity, a new era has been unravelling, we may \n\nactually even be entering into a new civilization. ... It is why this new civilization \n\nhas begun to generate its Law \u2013 a new type of Law. Environmental Law is not just \n\nanother specialised and technical branch, but requires a whole new philosophy that \n\nshapes the way we look at Law. \n\n \n\n4.2. The Legal Nebula \n\n \nDefining the outlines of reality upon which to build environmental law is conditioned \n\nby the possibility of knowing what is to be protected; in other words, by the ability to \n\ndefine and delimit the quid to be put under the scope (protection) of the law. \n\nThe transmutation of the \u201cenvironment\u201d from a slightly relevant social interest into an \n\nauthentic legal good, with a value per se, added a profound new meaning: The \n\n\u201cenvironment\u201d shall be protected as a value by itself, and not as it was previously \u2013 that \n\nis, merely the causal path of damage. \n\nPreviously, for law, damage to the environment only existed when it caused damage \n\nto people or goods. With the new formulation, damage is perceived as disturbance of an \n\nautonomous and unitary legal interest it allows, immediately, to draw \u2013 based on \n\naxiological ordering of the subject of injury \u2013 the distinction between damage to the \n\nenvironment as a legal good [ecological damage] and the damage caused to people and \n\n\n\n 88 \n\nproperty by environmental disturbances (environmental damage, Umweltsch\u00e4den, \n\nMilieusch\u00e4den). (Cunhal 2002:40) \n\nThe autonomy of the environment as a legal good, with a value per se, is one of the \n\nmajor conceptual achievements made along the path of legal protection for the \n\nenvironment. Despite several national and international legal systems adopting this \n\nrecognition, during this looking-for period, there was no scientific knowledge available \n\nthat would enable us to understand the facts, the quid, with which jurists were faced. This \n\nlack of knowledge and the impossibility of defining the environmental good within \n\nexisting paradigms made these new questions impertinent. \u201cThe subversive impulse of \n\nenvironmental law\u201d was what Canotilho (2009:2) called this structural incompatibility. \n\nIn our view, the subversion of law by the environment is based on three fundamental scale \n\npreconditions: \n\n\u2022 The global scale of the good intended to be captured under the scope of law, \n\nand the impossibility of establishing any kind of material or abstract legal \n\ndivision of the \"environmental good\u201d (geographic scale); \n\n\u2022 The cumulative and intergenerational character of the damages on and benefits \n\ncaused by this \u201cenvironmental good\u201d (time scale); \n\n\u2022 The restrictive and limiting approach of environmental law towards an \n\neconomic system conceived on unlimited growth on a planet with limited \n\nresources (economic/ecological scale). \n\n \n\nOn the way to representing the environment as a legal good, states found they needed \n\nto capture and create a narrative able to interpret something that had always had a local \n\nand a global dimension, diffuse and indeterminate. Some states searched the \u201cwhole\u201d \n\nwithin their own boundaries and eventually arrived at the understanding of the unitary \n\ncharacter of the environment. Departing from the principle of territoriality of norms and \n\npolitical power, it appears that this unitary character referred to a national context, even \n\nthough there was already an empirical perception that this unit referred in fact to the larger \n\nwhole, the global. But due to a lack of legal representation of the true scale of the legal \n\ngood in question, the \u201cenvironment\u201d had to adapt itself to political borders. \n\nThe attempt to define the global on a local scale quickly became ineffective. In the \n\nNational Environmental Performance Report on Planetary Boundaries of the Swedish \n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (Nykvist, Persson, Moberg, Persson, Cornell, &amp; \n\n\n\n 89 \n\nRockstr\u00f6m 2013:3), it is stated that \u201cSweden is exposed to environmental impacts from \n\nother countries which affect Sweden\u2019s ability to achieve these environmental quality \n\nobjectives. At the same time, Swedish consumption and production have an impact on \n\nenvironmental performance in other countries\u201d. International organizations such as the \n\nEU do recognize this global dependency: \u201cEven though we have never used our natural \n\nresources with so much efficiency as we do at present, we are still degrading our essential \n\nresources ... in Europe as well as in the rest of the world, and in the environmental field, \n\nborders do not exist\u201d (SOER 2015). \n\nThese structural genetic defects gave rise to a process of relativism and de-\n\nlegitimization of the legal good. The result was a dysfunctional congenital degeneration: \n\na) the legal weight of \u201cecological footprints turned out to be unsupportable by \n\nthe jus utendi, fruendi et abutendi of property and sovereignty (Canotilho \n\n2009:2); \n\nb) the cumulative character and global spread of harm over the course of various \n\ngenerations, and protection of rights without subjects (namely future \n\ngenerations); \n\nc) the causal link between the acts that harm the systemic character of the \n\nenvironmental damage and affect all the Earth System, whose effects only \n\nreveal themselves much later; \n\nd) the global dispersion of benefits of ecosystem services; \n\ne) the idea of polygonal relations extended to a global scale, within a context of \n\nplural responsibility; \n\nf) the tipping points resulting from the accumulation of damage caused over the \n\ncourse of various generations; \n\ng) interconnections between different territorial components divided by abstract \n\npolitical frontiers; \n\nh) the imposition of limits and environmental obligations as generators of \n\nunequal competing conditions on a global scale; and \n\n\n\n 90 \n\ni) the legitimacy problem of instituting legal proceedings, civil society or class \n\nactions. \n\nAll things considered, there was more than enough reason to reject this first-generation \n\nbranch of environmental law. Incompatibility with the assumptions of the system gave \n\nrise to a phenomenon which is referred to in specialised literature as Vollzug Defizit, the \n\nimplementation deficit (Hucke &amp; Wollmann 1998), or enforcement deficit. It came to \n\ncharacterise environmental law due to a) an exponential proliferation of norms and \n\nstandards; b) the manipulated application with intent to restrict its scope; c) the systemic \n\ndeferral while awaiting regulation; and d) outright failure to apply norms. Prieur \n\n(187:320) considered it a \u201cdiffuse form of deregulation\u201d while Charbonneau (1998) \n\nspeaks of a de-legitimization of environmental law and Carbonnier raises the hypothesis \n\nof No-Law. \n\nBut as paradoxical as it may seem, even when rejected, this quid referent to a \n\nhealthiness environment did in fact invoke a qualitative change in the fundamental goals \n\nof states. That is so because it did not cease to represent a value superior to those the law \n\naims to protect, both from an individual or collective point of view. \n\nThis deep material foundation, as a vital dimension of life and the human species, is \n\nnot just a constitutionally guaranteed right in about 125 constitutions (Bosselmann \n\n2016:72); it is even being considered a hypothesis that would lead to the emergence of a \n\nnew type of state, a post-social state (Silva 1989), or a successor to the welfare state, an \n\nenvironmental law state (Rangel 1994). \n\nThe entry of the environment into the core fundamental objectives and tasks of the \n\nstates as a collective legal good and/or fundamental right of each individual citizen also \n\nraised procedural questions of legitimacy in court or when participating in administrative \n\nprocedures. \n\nVarious states (mainly Portuguese-speaking countries), challenged by a reality not \n\nreflected in their spatial dimension, sought to develop a theory through \u201cproblem words\u201d \n\nthat were better able to portray the diluted and diffuse reality that conditioned them. The \n\n\u201ctheory of diffuse interests\u201d at the basis of class action (in Portuguese A\u00e7\u00e3o Popular) \n\nteaches us that when legal goods are involved, such as the environment, consumption or \n\nquality of life, \"they belong to all of us and can never be allocated exclusively to any \n\nsubject. It means that the diffuse interests include at the same time a collective and \n\nindividual dimension, neither being merely collective, nor merely individual\" (Sousa \n\n\n\n 91 \n\n1998). Cappelletti (1975) expresses the other side of the coin: they belong \"to everyone \n\nand no one\". \n\nBut the all-encompassing scale of diffuse interests, once again, cannot be limited to a \n\nsingle community belonging to a particular state but only to humanity as a collective in \n\nthe trans-spatial dimension, such as \u201cthe entire human race, being the combination of all \n\nhuman beings that inhabit the planet\u201d (Santos 200:68), and in a trans-temporal dimension, \n\nin the sense of the collective ad infinitum, including all human beings that will succeed \n\nthe current living generation at a given time (Malhotra 1998:41). Each generation thus \n\nbecomes \u201ca link in an endless chain of generations that collectively forms a community, \n\na human family\u201d (Agius 1998:7). This has led to a doctrine that defends the emergence \n\nof a new subject in international law: humanity; a true \u201crevolution in social and legal \n\nthought\u201d (Agius 1998:7). \n\nThe combination of the \u201cwhole\u201d and \u201ceveryone\u201d may be the biggest challenge that the \n\nlaw will face in this century. The uncertainty exists not only around the good intended to \n\ncome under the law\u2019s protection but also around the identification of the holders of this \n\ndiffuse good, therefore the nebula broadens to the international dimension. \n\nThe UN General Assembly Resolution 43/53 Protection of Global Climate for Present \n\nand Future Generations of Mankind of 6 December, 1988, with a combination of lack of \n\npolitical will and an absence of suitable concepts to define a fundamental resource, state \n\nthat \"climate change on Earth and its adverse effects are a common concern of mankind\". \n\nThis solution has roots in concepts such as common interest, global commons, \n\nintergenerational equity, responsibility or rights, common ecological heritage of \n\nhumankind, life-support system and \u201cthe awareness that the problems of ocean space are \n\nclosely interrelated and need to be considered as a whole\u201d (UNCLOS 1982)6. They all \n\nshare the difficulty of defining their form in a precise manner. \n\nSo we arrive at a point where all contradictions and paradoxes of the legal nebula are \n\npossible, especially when \u201cproblem words\u201d blend into \u201cconcern words\u201d through \n\nindeterminate, merely descriptive, neutral and open concepts. It can easily lead to the \n\n\u201cwhole\u201d being synonymous for nothing and nobody. \u201cInternational law itself was (and to \n\na certain extent remains) ill-equipped to address state activities affecting negatively an \n\nintangible natural resource which spans across and beyond the national territories of \n\nstates\u201d (Borg 2009:1). \n\n                                                \n \n\n\n\n 92 \n\n \n\n4.3. The \u201cWhole\u201d Problem \n\n \nThe reality of the \u201cwhole\u201d disappears in the political map of state boundaries. \n\nHowever, if the \u201cwhole\u201d exists in a higher level of functioning and integration of the \n\nEarth System, is it or is it not possible to represent this new reality beyond the states? \n\nStarting from the first two elements that gave rise to structural incompatibility, \n\ngeographic scale and time scale, which carried with them the subversion introduced into \n\nthe law by the \"environment\", and recent developments in our knowledge on the \n\nfunctioning of the Earth System, we will work on a possible evolution of these still \n\nembryonic and inefficient formulations of legal concerns from an actual vague and \n\nindeterminate formula into an operational legal instrument, giving shape to rights and \n\nduties. \n\nExpressions such as \u201clife-sustaining systems of the biosphere\u201d (United Nations 1992), \n\n\u201cconservation of climate as part of the common heritage of mankind\u201d (United Nations \n\n1988), or that \u201cthe problems of the ocean space are closely interrelated and need to be \n\nconsidered as a whole\u201d (UNCLOS 1982) presented in different texts of international law \n\nare themselves attempts to approach the biogeophysical foundations at the basis of the \n\nemergence of life and the conditions that allowed the development of human civilization. \n\nIt is clear that these merely descriptive concepts are not rooted in a set of criteria that \n\noffer the possibility of measurement or delimitation that would allow us to define a legal \n\nobject; that is, to define the concept and its amplitude, distinguishing it for all other legal \n\ngoods but also matching the unitary global reality of the \u201cenvironment\u201d. \n\nThe word system in the term life-sustaining systems of the biosphere points back to the \n\nempirical idea of a combination of various interrelated and interacting components, out \n\nof which emerges a whole that is more than the sum of its components. However, this \n\nreference to general concepts, without proceeding to a description of criteria that could \n\nbe used to delimit a physical space in which the system operates or the mention of an \n\nindicator that provides us with information on the system state, once again reveals how \n\nunspecified concepts rule the environmental nebula. \n\nThe phrase conservation of climate as part of the common heritage of mankind, \n\nalthough referring to the initial proposal of the Maltese initiative and is included as such \n\nin the text of this resolution of the UN General Assembly, does not refer to a specific and \n\n\n\n 93 \n\nparticular good but rather to a set of interconnected goods that shape a system with a \n\nspecific functionality inherited from Mother Nature. This heritage is the integration of the \n\ngeophysical properties of the planet with the living biosphere that forms a single global \n\nsystem as the result of an evolutionary process of interaction. \n\nEven the expression whole carries with it a systemic idea. It means that, as in the \n\npreamble of UNCLOS (1982)7 where the necessity to manage \u201cocean space\u201d is \n\nrecognized, it refers not to the geographical and political space made up by the sum of \n\nthe different areas of state jurisdiction and high seas but rather to the necessity to elaborate \n\non problems related to the use of the oceans as a whole, taking into account the ocean \n\nenvironment as an integrated fluid ecological system. Though still empirical in nature, \n\nthe perception exists that all these concepts direct us towards the notion of a system. The \n\nquestion of how we can build a legal concept relating to a system not tied to any territorial \n\ndelimitation, since in environmental matters the system is global, remains unanswered. \n\nWhat are these life-sustaining systems of the biosphere, the biosphere being an object \n\nthat is not confined to any sovereignty, existing both in and outside all sovereignties? We \n\ncan all perceive it intuitively but we cannot touch or appropriate it, even though it is \n\nprofoundly related to and dependent on the physical nature placed under the jurisdiction \n\nof the different states of the planet. What is ocean space as a whole, which apparently \n\ntranscends every sea, ocean or jurisdiction but does not materialize in a geographical \n\ndimension? What is this natural heritage that belongs to the time continuum of all \n\nsuccessive generations, carrying with it interests shared with the unborn, and which \n\nshould not be mixed with the territorial space that belongs to the people amongst whom \n\nthey will be born? \n\nThe first jump into the unknown will focus on both the dysfunctional relationship \n\nbetween the reductionist physicist or biological approach of law towards nature and the \n\nintangible geophysical realities that determine the state and functioning of the Earth \n\nSystem. \n\nIt seems to us that the key to establishing order in our interpretation, as we construct \n\nlegal abstractions in regard to nature, lies in the recognition of different analytical levels. \n\nAs Soromenho-Marques (2006:57) observes in relation to the immaterial heritage, \u201cit also \n\nmatters here to avoid reductionism of a physicist or biological nature, we should today \n\navoid the repetition of an old debate that ran through the 17th and 18th centuries on the \n\n                                                \n \n\n\n\n 94 \n\nnature of matter, as the Newtonian theory of the Universe was presented. During this \n\nperiod, the Cartesians rejected the theory of gravitational force as they considered it \n\n\"miraculous\". For them, the category of material force should always be characterised by \n\ndirect transmission through physical contact. We cannot make the same mistake \n\nconcerning the heritage. In fact there exist other types of heritage beyond those that can \n\nbe seen or touched.\u201d \n\nIn this search for the environmental legal good, the law has already had to face realities \n\nthat go beyond our sensory capacity and had the necessity to broaden to the notion of \n\nsystem and ecosystem functions, which have already been recognized in some legal \n\norders, particularly the European Union (Comiss\u00e3o Europeia, 2000). Although these \n\nevolutions are attempts to theorize reality and produce a more adequate representation of \n\nthe systemic character of environmental goods, we do not yet have a concept able to \n\nrepresent the true scale of these biogeophysical interconnections that extended human \n\nrelations on a global scale. \n\nWe find ourselves in a stalemate. On one hand, if we advance with the search for this \n\nenvironmental legal good within the geographical limits of states, we obtain an ecological \n\nnonsense,5 inevitably amputated and dysfunctional. On the other hand, if we approach the \n\nEarth System on its true scale of biogeophysical relationships, we will collide with the \n\ngeographic delimitation of sovereignties and the lack of the political and legal existence \n\nof the entire Earth System, and therefore arrive at a completely dysfunctional relationship \n\nbetween the Earth System and the social system. \n\nThe awareness of the different internal dynamic levels of the Earth System and its \n\ndependence on the core drivers at the origin of a structural pattern that produced a unique \n\nperiod of climatic stability in the history of the planet (the Holocene) could determine the \n\nname and define what kind of environmental legal good we are looking for. It is so that \n\nthe possibility to accurately represent facts and reconstitute, legitimize and thereby make \n\nsovereignty evolve, as has happened along the course of history, will only become viable \n\nif we cease to hide the reality of these intangible relations. \n\nThe intangible heritage contributes to the understanding of the critical crossroads \n\nof contemporary humanity, shedding light on the human condition, and on some of \n\nthe possible paths for their redemption. (Soromenho-Marques 2006:62) \n\n \n\n\n\n 95 \n\n \n\n4.4. The Software/Hardware Relation \n\n \nDefining and delimiting the quid to be placed under the scope of law will require the \n\nconstruction of legal abstractions in accordance with the known reality of nature, and \n\nfinding solutions that harmonise representations of nature with those of the social system. \n\nThe fact that the planet, as opposed to many others, is not just a sphere of rocks and \n\nan atmosphere offers us a solid point of departure for our reflection. Our planet, orbiting \n\naround the sun at a distance of 149 million kilometres in an orbit called the habitable \n\nzone,6 created the necessary physical conditions for an active water cycle to exist, which \n\nincludes the three \u2013 solid, liquid and gaseous \u2013 phases. This water cycle enabled the \n\ndevelopment of an incredibly complex biosphere, forming patterns of organization and \n\nglobal integration through combined internal interaction. Together these patterns form a \n\nmeta-system. \n\nThe need to understand this global reality led to an evolution in life sciences, which \n\nintegrated different areas of scientific knowledge, creating a contrast with the reductionist \n\ntendencies of the Cartesian perspective. This process eventually resulted in the concept \n\nof the Earth System that came to mean \u201cthe suite of interacting physical, chemical, and \n\nbiological global-scale cycles (often called biogeochemical cycles) and energy fluxes \n\nwhich provide the conditions necessary for life on the planet\u201d (Oldfield &amp; Steffen \n\n2004:7). \n\nBeing in dialectical interaction with the biotic and abiotic infrastructures, these \n\nprocesses function as a set of intangible operational instructions with properties that \n\ndetermine the ways in which the Earth System self-organizes and regulates itself, and can \n\nbe designated as the \u201cprogramme\u201d of the Earth System. In a brilliant theoretical analogy, \n\nSoromenho-Marques (2006:59) clarifies the relationship between tangible and intangible \n\nheritage: \"I believe that in an ultramodern analogy, we can read this relationship in the \n\nsame way that software and hardware relate to each other.\" This analogy could in fact be \n\nequally valid on revealing the relation between tangible infrastructure (res corporals) of \n\nthe planet and the intangible system (res incorporales) of physical laws, thermodynamics \n\nor biochemistry, forming in their combination an authentic piece of software containing \n\nthe operational instructions that determine the functioning state of the Earth System. \n\n\n\n 96 \n\n \nFigure 5. The hardware/software relation and the Earth System/planet relation \n \n\nThe Earth System is a very real and constant presence in our lives. However, since we \n\ncannot see or touch it, it was thought to be infinitely abstract, but, recently, technological \n\nevolution easily made it visual through images captured from space. It thus became an \n\nopen book that has since dazzled us with its high degree of interaction. \n\nThe feedback we are getting on the state of the system and current technological \n\ndevelopments are allowing us to read this \u201cbook of instructions\u201d across different scientific \n\nareas. \u201cFor the first time in history, humans have knowledge at their disposal to exert a \n\npower over nature, over life and death, allowing us to gain control over what would \n\npreviously escape our reach, being considered a certain fatality or causal chain of events\u201d \n\n(Silva 2002:10). \n\nAt the same time, this potential opened up a new field of opportunities and dangers. In \n\nthe case of genetic information, the law was called upon to intervene, imposing rules and \n\nlimits to human-making (bio-law), and information of the human genome was considered \n\nthe heritage of mankind, even though in symbolic meaning only (UNESCO 1997). \n\nThe previous example shows that the recognition of objects of intangible or immaterial \n\ncharacter is not new to legal sciences. Other examples are cultural heritage, recognized \n\n\n\n 97 \n\nthrough UNESCO\u2019s Intangible Cultural Heritage (UNESCO 2003), the intangible value \n\nof companies in commercial law and the intellectual property rights and authorship \n\nthrough statements that establish the independence between author\u2019s rights and the \n\nmaterial support of a work. Despite problems of definition and delimitation, the \n\nimportance of the values intended to be protected have always justified the search for new \n\nsolutions. \n\nAccording to Olfield and Steffen (2004:7), the Earth System consists of an interactive \n\natmosphere, ocean, biosphere, cryosphere, and lithosphere that form together a complete \n\nand unified system with characteristics defined as follows. \n\nIt deals with a materially closed system that has a primary external energy source, \n\nthe sun. \n\n\u2022 The major dynamic components of the Earth System are a suite of interlinked \n\nphysical, chemical and biological processes that cycle (transport and \n\ntransform) materials and energy in complex dynamic ways within the System. \n\nThe forcings and feedbacks within the System are at least as important to the \n\nfunctioning of the System as are the external drivers. \n\n\u2022 Biological/ecological processes are an integral part of the functioning of the Earth \n\nSystem, and not just the recipients of changes in the dynamics of a chemical \n\nsystem. Living organisms are active participants, not simply passive respondents. \n\nHuman beings, their societies and their activities are an integral component of the \n\nEarth System, and are not outside forces perturbing an otherwise natural system. \n\nThere are many modes of natural variability and instabilities within the System as \n\nwell as anthropologically driven changes. By definition, both types of variability \n\nare part of the dynamics of the Earth System. They are often impossible to \n\nseparate completely and they interact in complex and sometimes mutually \n\nreinforcing ways. \n\n\u2022 Time scales considered in Earth System science vary according to the questions \n\nbeing asked. Many global environmental change issues consider time scales of \n\ndecades to a century or two. However, a basic understanding of Earth System \n\ndynamics demands consideration of much longer time scales in order to capture \n\nlonger-term variability of the System, to understand the fundamental dynamics \n\nof the System, and to place into context the current suite of rapid global-scale \n\n\n\n 98 \n\nchanges occurring within the System. Thus environmental and prognostic \n\nmodelling approaches are both central to Earth System science. \n\nNow, as we examine this definition of the Earth System and the enumeration of its \n\ncharacteristics from the perspective of law, it seems that many of the problems associated \n\nthe definition of legal environmental objects at state level have their origin within these \n\ncharacteristics. The same difficulties are faced by international law. These difficulties \n\nconverge in the first two preconditions (geographic scale and time scale) that motivate \n\nthe subversive character of environmental law, as follows: \n\n\u2022 At the state level, the environment was understood as \"an autonomous and unitary \n\nlegal good\". As such, it became a synonym for diffuse and indefinable, thus \n\nrendering the protection of this good dysfunctional; \n\n\u2022 At the international level, the compartmentalised approach that considered and \n\nanalysed only the distinct components of the Earth System concealed phenomena \n\nof interaction and emergence. \n\nThe dysfunction between the current knowledge of the Earth System and the law finds \n\nsupport in the post-2015 Development Agenda of the United Nations, and within the \n\nformulation of the sustainable development goals (SDG). This UN strategy puts an \n\nemphasis on \u201cthe need for a coherent global framework to integrate existing laws that \n\nwould cover these international areas\u201d (UN, 2013). While international treaties and \n\nconventions relative to global common goods do exist, the United Nations recognizes that \n\n\u201cthe frameworks are fractured, and not comprehensive enough to include modern \n\nconservation principles or assessments\u201d (Olfield &amp; Steffen 2004:7). \n\n \n\n4.5. A Space Without Territory \n\n \nThe concept or the most adequate international law term (Shelton 2009) to describe \n\nthe characteristics outlined by Olfield and Steffen from a legal perspective is the common \n\nconcern of humankind (CCH), which emerged with regard to the climate in the UNGA \n\n43/53 (1988) resolution (http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/43/a43r053.htm). While \n\nthis concept is still just a phrase or term that should be understood in a broad sense, \n\n\n\n 99 \n\ntherefore being inapt to serve as operational or normative support for an international \n\nenvironment regime, Dina Shelton knew to appreciate the notable innovation of this term \n\nand the profound implications of its premises. According to Shelton (2009), the concept \n\nintroduces two fundamental innovations into international law: the first relates to the fact \n\nthat this concept does not make any reference to states; the second being the absence of \n\nany reference to a geographically delimited area, even though it is associated with other \n\nconcepts such as the global commons areas \u2013 the high seas, Antarctica, the seabed and \n\nouter space \u2013 where the common heritage of mankind is applied. \u201cCommon concerns are \n\ndifferent because they are not spatial, belonging to a specific area, but can occur within \n\nor outside sovereign territory\u201d (Shelton 2009). \n\nIn the opening speech of the second meeting of the Group of Legal Experts to examine \n\nthe concept of the common concern of mankind in relation to global environmental issues \n\nin Geneva 1991, Mostafa K. Tolba, the director of UNEP at that time, asserted: \n\nIt is very important that the concept of common concern of mankind is further \n\nelaborated to make its contents and scope understandable and clear; it is also \n\nimportant to make sure how this concept can be interpreted in the terms of rights \n\nand obligations of States in the process of its implementation. It is understandable \n\nthat, since it is a new concept in international law and international relations, it \n\nwill develop further in the near future and its interpretation given today, will evolve. \n\n With these statements, the central idea of this concept \u2013 that its birth is only its own \n\nevolution\u2013 is retained. It was born as a quasi-concept, as a future project, a proclamation \n\nof the need to find an idea for an unsolved problem. In other words, since its appearance, \n\nthe common concern is valuable for the novelty it was, and for what it might still be and \n\nrepresent. It is certain about 30 years on that the UN resolution on the common concern \n\nwas the way round a possible legal status for the unique nature of climate which is not \n\nrestricted to the global commons but spans also across areas subject to national \n\njurisdiction (Borg 2007). The climate continues to be orphaned not of a definition but of \n\na legal framework for its existence. In the report of this meeting (UNEP Secretariat, \n\n1991), it was said: \n\nDuring the general discussion on the concept of common concern of mankind, the \n\nexperts reiterated that the concept still has no legal consequences in terms of rights \n\nand duties. It was stressed that the concept should not infringe the sovereign right \n\n\n\n 100 \n\nof States and, in this context, a point was raised whether it is desirable to narrow \n\ndown the scope of the concept and its application and confine it to global \n\nenvironmental issues which may cause significant adverse effects upon the \n\nenvironment. It was re-emphasized that the common concern concept was not meant \n\nto substitute the concept of common heritage. There was a general understanding \n\nthat at the current stage the common concern of mankind may serve as guiding \n\nprinciple rather than legal rule. \n\nHe identified the following aspects of the concept of common concern of mankind \n\nthat require further consideration and elaboration by legal experts: \n\n- Possible implications of the concept for specific obligations in the relevant \n\ninternational treaties; \n\n- Implication for the human right to a healthy environment; \n\n-Implication with respect to the issues of equitable burden sharing and fair \n\ncompensation. \n\nAlthough it is made clear here that the CCH (common concern of humankind) was not \n\nintended to replace the CHM, the need for this statement and its reinforcement justifies \n\nand substantiates the deep connection between the two concepts and their common origin. \n\nBy listing the issues that need further consideration, we consider that there is a common \n\ndenominator among the original objectives of the CHM and the future project \n\nimplementation of CCH. \n\n Both concepts are the result of the same initial boost of looking for an international \n\nmanagement regime with the goal of long-term environmental protection through new \n\nstructures of politics and governance beyond states, without infringing the sovereign \n\nrights of states. For all purposes, the CCH is an embryonic form of the non-territorial \n\ndimension of the CHM that never came into being, although that was the motivation and \n\nsource of the initial boost. In this sense, the CCH represents a latent new legal theory, a \n\nunited and interdependent global reality seeking its roots in the ancient moral or ethical \n\nconcepts that unify humanity in the nature of the planet it inhabits. \n\nBut, unlike the CHM, which still had some \u201cspecific areas of the Earth\u201d, remnants of \n\nthe geographical divisions, to anchor its existence, the global nature and res incorporales \n\ncharacter of the CCH led to a permanently postponed future. This lack of definition and \n\n\n\n 101 \n\nevolution sine die is matched only by the initial project of Arvid Pardo, which suggests \n\nthat the CHM concept is useful in \u201corganizing new forms international cooperation in \n\nmatters that are not directly related to specific areas of the Earth (\u2026) [including] climate \n\nand the environment\u201d (Pardo 1989,9\u201310).7 \n\nThe resolution UNGA 43/53 (1988), as Borg (2007) recognizes, \u201cidentifies the legal \n\nstatus of an \u2018intangible\u2019 common resource (climate) that spans the global commons\u201d. It \n\nis with the absence of a theory capable of representing the intangibility of nature and \n\nrecognizing legally a good that is both inside and outside of all states that we can \n\nsummarize our inability to accurately portray the reality around us. \n\n Therefore, expounding on the statements of the experts, the CCH is not really a \n\nsubstitute of CHM that was compressed and mutilated to fit the territoriality of the borders \n\nof states but rather an attempt to fulfil the original objectives of the CHM itself. \n\nStill, the comments made by Shelton about this quasi-concept may yet prove extremely \n\nuseful in the search of a legal environmental good when the absence of spatial character \n\nturns into a living space, as paradoxical as that may seem. \u201cThe environment is not an \n\nabstraction but represents a living space, the quality of life and the very health of human \n\nbeings, including generations unborn\u201d (Shelton 2009:2). This statement is in tune with \n\nspace as a concept in the global context as considered by theorists on international \n\nrelations: \u201cAlthough globalisation theorists differ on whether globalisation marks a \n\ndistinct rupture in modernity, they do agree that the separation of space from place is a \n\nbasic characteristic of modernity that continues but accentuated form under globalising \n\nprocesses\u201d (Coleman 2007:95). \n\n \n\n4.6. A Safe Space Without Territory \n\n \nOne of the dimensions of complex sovereignty is its openness towards finding new \n\nconcepts able to represent new loci in a transnational or global space. Thereby it presents \n\nan alternative to the exclusive perspective of space as a territory, distinguishing between \n\nspace with its worldwide operation and place. For Giddens (1990:18),  \n\nThe advent of modernity increasingly tears space away from place by fostering \n\nrelations between \u2018absent\u2019 others, locationally distant from any given situation of \n\nface-to-face interaction\u2026 What structures the locale is not simply that what is \n\n\n\n 102 \n\npresent on the scene; the \u2018visible form\u2019 of the local conceals the distant relations \n\nwhich determine its nature.  \n\nAnd for Dirlik (2001:18), \u201cSpace in this sense refers to products\u201d. \n\nThis interesting development, where the spatial geographic representation is absorbed \n\nby the \u201cfunctional\u201d dimension of life, offers a functional space that is in accordance with \n\nShelton's living space as a space system with the function of supporting life. On the other \n\nhand, the primarily spatial representation of the figure of sovereignty is relaxed, \n\nparticularly when newly emerging forms of political authority are read to entail not only \n\na spatial but also a functional reconfiguration. Such emerging forms are also read as the \n\nincreasing importance of functional over spatial understandings of political authority. \n\n(Albert 2007:53) \n\nThe non-territorial and intangible character of the climate and the function of \n\nmaintaining a stable climate meet this vision of a functional space. This new context is \n\nstill going through a process of assimilation and conceptual adaptation. We should \n\nemphasise that the living space referred to by Shelton (2009) is not just the climate system \n\nbut the whole life-support system, of which the climate system is just one part. \n\nTo clarify these concepts and introduce some order into our interpretation, we recur \n\nonce again to Olfield and Steffen (2004:7). \n\nThe term climate system is also used in connection with global change, and is \n\nencompassed within the Earth System. Climate usually refers to the aggregation of all \n\ncomponents of weather \u2013 precipitation, temperature, cloudiness, for example \u2013 averaged \n\nover a long period of time, usually decades, centuries, or longer. The processes which \n\ncontribute to climate comprise the climate system, and they are closely connected to \n\nbiogeochemical cycles. However, there are some important differences between climate \n\nchange and global change: \n\n\u2022 Many important features of biogeochemical cycles can have significant \n\nimpacts on Earth System functioning without any direct change in the \n\nclimate system. Examples include the direct effects of changing \n\natmospheric CO2 concentration on carbonate chemistry and hence on \n\ncalcification rates in the ocean and also the sharp depletion of stratospheric \n\nozone from the injection of chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere. \n\n\n\n 103 \n\n\u2022 Many interactions between biology and chemistry can have profound \n\nimpacts on ecological systems, and hence feedbacks to Earth System \n\nfunctioning, without any change in the climate system. Examples include \n\nthe impact of nitrogen deposition on the biological diversity of terrestrial \n\necosystems and the effect of non-climate driven changes in terrestrial and \n\nmarine biosphere emission of trace gases and hence to the chemistry of the \n\natmosphere. \n\n\u2022 Human societies and their activities are usually not considered to be a direct \n\npart of the climate system, although their activities certainly impact on \n\nimportant processes in the climate system (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions). \n\nThe scale of the living space underlying the CCH would have to be the whole Earth \n\nSystem itself. This means, apart from the various spaces such as climate, biodiversity and \n\noceans, we need an integrated and integrating approach. Considering that the UN \n\nrecognizes the lack of a system approach to environmental problems, and that the common \n\nconcern is the only term in international law capable of drawing a systemic reality that \n\nexists both in and outside of sovereignties, we need to evolve towards a concept that is \n\nable to define the living space. Although there has already been a consensus over the \n\nexistence of a certain ecological global living space, there was no information available \n\nto define and delimit it. \n\nWith the exponential development of Earth System sciences in the last 25 years, and \n\nthe evolution of Earth observations from space, much of what was concealed from our \n\nsenses has turned into a reality that we can observe in real time as external spectators. By \n\ncombining all the information of the spatial \u201cbig picture\u201d with the information collected \n\nfrom the lower level of the system, for example, through climate palaeontology, it has \n\nbecome possible to reconstruct a history of the atmosphere and the whole Earth System. \n\nKnowing the historical behavior of the Earth System is crucial to understanding the value \n\nof the Holocene to humankind, it could have a central role in the definition of the new \n\nlegal object that lacks protection. \n\nOver the long course of history of our planet, many different chemical compositions \n\nof the atmosphere and the oceans have given origin to different levels of heat \n\naccumulation, energetic equilibrium and states of the Earth System. Knowing the history \n\nof chemical structures and the different resulting combinations of element interaction \n\n\n\n 104 \n\nallowed us to understand the true unique conditions that characterised the period of \n\nclimatic stability in the last 11,700 years called the Holocene. \n\nAs we have seen in previous chapters, chemical alterations and the destruction of \n\necological infrastructures as a result from the Great Acceleration8 are pushing the Earth \n\nout of the stable domain of the Holocene \u2013 the only state of the Earth System that we \n\nknow for certain is capable of supporting advanced human civilizations \u2013 and threatening \n\nto undermine our prosperity. The scientific community has attempted to respond to the \n\nchallenge of understanding and measuring this living space by developing the concept of \n\nplanetary boundaries (Steffen et al. 2015; Rockstr\u00f6m et al. 2009). These boundaries are \n\nbased on the intrinsic \u201chard-wired\u201d properties of the Earth System itself. They define a \n\ncombination of indicators that describe the state of the Earth System. \n\nWith access to the information in the \"software\u201d, we have gained the ability to define \n\nand measure our living space. The paradoxical system of problem words that defined \n\nconcerns as legal concepts now have a table where the vital factors are properly listed, \n\nwith every factor assigned to a safe zone, with a minimum and maximum that we must \n\nnot transgress. And this is being done on a scale upon which we all truly depend \u2013 the \n\nglobal scale. So, the living space, an intangible and non-territorial space of the CCH, will \n\ncoincide with this well-defined state of the Holocene, denominated by the scientific \n\ncommunity as the safe operating space of humankind. \n\nIn conceptual terms, this living space operated by the safe operating space of \n\nhumankind is consistent with the separation performed by international relations theorists \n\nbetween space and place. \n\nIf we are able to distinguish the planet, with its 510 million square kilometers, from \n\nthe Earth System and its different possible states, we can start to imagine alternative \n\nconcepts of global coordination, without affecting the constituent elements of \n\nsovereignty. In fact, within a context of systemic dependency of all sovereignties upon \n\nthe same living space, the separation of this functional and intangible space of life from \n\nthe physical space of the planet and its sovereignties may even be the theoretical \n\nfoundation for the development of solutions. \n\nThis new conception of a safe operating space for humankind should in turn lead to a \n\nnew juridical conception of the Earth System that corresponds better with the new \n\nscientific knowledge, notwithstanding the uncertainties that will always exist. \n\nConsidering that space technology allowed this intangible nature to become \n\nperceivable by our senses, and the concept of planetary boundaries offered us the \"genetic \n\n\n\n 105 \n\ncode\" of the functioning of Spaceship Earth, we now have an obligation to organize \n\nourselves and learn to steer collectively. In fact, the only thing that is truly within our \n\nreach is managing and governing ourselves in respect of our interactions with the Earth \n\nSystem. The creation of functional spaces without territory, thereby being global, may \n\nconstitute a fixed point, an element of stability, upon which we may base a new approach \n\nand build an organization. In this sense, the possible construction of a new autonomous \n\nlegal good as a converging point of a looking-for process should focus on the evolution \n\nof this combination of processes with shared origins and goals, continuing the search for \n\nthe stabilization of a space to be invented. \n\n \n\n4.7. From a Space of Concerns to a Heritage \n\n \nThe concept of CHM as a legal one is one of the most revolutionary and radical \n\ndevelopments in the last 50 years of international law. Since its emergence, it became \n\nclear that no other concept, notion, principle or doctrine provoked such intense debate \n\nand controversy as did the possibility of attributing a heritage to both present and future \n\nhumanity. Its revolutionary and subversive character stems from the philosophical \n\nconcept of \"humanity\", which raises questions over legal regimes of resources that are \n\ncrucial for the maintenance of the living space for and by both present and future \n\ngenerations. \n\nSince the application and implementation of the CHM required critical re-evaluation \n\nof many principles and doctrines of classical international law, this adverse context \n\ninevitably resulted in an inadequate implementation9. Put otherwise, the application of \n\nthe model as originally proposed by Arvid Pardo (1976), without the recognition of the \n\ndifferent existing integration levels of the Earth System (unknown at that time), led to a \n\nconfrontation between an intellectually valid philosophical principle, that recognized the \n\nocean as a heritage of mankind and the lower system level where the model of political \n\nand territorial fragmentation reigns. \n\nAs the current legal order only acknowledged some of the separate and individual \n\ncomponents of the Earth System and not the healthiness of the system as a whole at its \n\nhigher level, the CHM concept was inevitably pulled towards the only existing lower \n\nlevel. At this point, a confrontation became unavoidable. It is true that the oceans possess \n\na territorial dimension, but the presence of a functional biochemical dimension that \n\n\n\n 106 \n\ndetermines their quality is no less of a truth. This dimension, incompatible with the legal \n\nabstractions of political borders, is inevitably global. \n\nIn geographical terms, a dead and acidified ocean may continue to be the object of \n\njurisdictional divisions of sovereign powers but it may not serve as an existing life support \n\nto marine life and humanity as a whole. It was this functional and qualitative oceanic \n\nsystem that Arvid Pardo was referring to when he launched the concept of the heritage of \n\nmankind in 1967. \n\nAs there was no legal distinction between the system and the place where the system \n\nwould operate, the CHM was limited to existing concepts, imprisoned within the \n\nterritorial dimension of place, becoming confined to leftover parts of state appropriations \n\nlying outside state borders. \n\nIt was the only possible approach; and in fact, it still is. However, soon enough a \n\nconflict was revealed between the interests and the territorial claims of states, rendering \n\nthe approach inoperable for goods that cannot be geographically defined, such as the \n\nclimate. This is why the vital good, a stable climate from which humanity has only been \n\nable to receive the benefits in the last 10,000 years, has so far remained a concern or a \n\nstate of mind, reduced to a narrow concept of atmospheric pollution to be managed on a \n\nterritorial basis. \n\nAmongst existing legal frameworks, it is difficult to embed and create a non-territory, \n\nor a territory at global scale with intangible characteristics that escape the existing models \n\nof physical and biological nature. The only reason the CHM has survived, even though it \n\nsubverts the model of political-territorial fragmentation, is due to the initial formulations \n\nproving to be philosophically valid and ethically undeniable. Actually, there exists a \n\ngrowing understanding that we are at the limits of international law and we need a radical \n\nadvancement, and CHM and its CCH substitutes and ineffective derivatives are concepts \n\nthat could open the door. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.8. Holocene State as a Heritage Protected by Law \n\n \nThe process that gave birth to the period of the Holocene, unique in terms of climatic \n\nstability in the history of the Earth,10 was a phenomenon of spontaneous emergence from \n\nthe combination of certain elements and their proportions, and which in their reciprocal \n\n\n\n 107 \n\ninteractions formed a pattern, giving rise to a combined organizational \"order\". This \n\nnatural process should be embraced by humanity as one of the greatest gifts it received \n\nfrom nature, as it was exactly these conditions that allowed for the development of human \n\ncivilizations and all the species of the planet that share the same ecological needs. \n\nWe are not able to protect this phenomenon of emergence or teleconnections but we \n\ncan protect the biogeophysical structures and processes of the state of the Earth System \n\nthat assure its maintenance. These biogeophysical structures and their internal relative \n\nconcentrations of gases are a gift to humanity that resulted from millions of years of \n\ninteractions at Earth's history scale. These intangible conditions have the highest value \n\nfor humankind. They are a true grundnorm, where other values, already legally protected, \n\nand a system of organization should establish its locus, its basis of stability. \n\nAccording to Rakhyun and Bosselmann (2013:283), \n\nThis context, the planetary boundaries framework, scientifically suggests the \n\nexistence of a foundational environmental principle or grundnorm, which, for the \n\npurpose of our research, can be defined as a basic norm to bind any governmental \n\npower. This understanding differs from Kelsen\u2019s definition, and is closer to Kant\u2019s \n\nargument that any positive law must be grounded in a \u2018natural\u2019 norm of general \n\nacceptance and reasonableness (Vernunft) to prevent pure arbitrariness. The \n\nexistence of an environmental grundnorm, therefore, rests on the assumption that \n\nrespecting planetary boundaries is a dictate of reason (Gebot der Vernunft) and \n\ngeneral acceptance (allgemeine G\u00fcltigkeit). Conceptually, a grundnorm exists \n\nindependently of a legal system, but underpins legal reasoning in the form of an \n\ninference rule. \n\nIn this sense we can argue that the state of the Earth System corresponding to the \n\ngeological period of the Holocene carries the meaning of heritage as something we need \n\nto conserve in everyone's interest. It enables the recognition of a new value to be legally \n\nprotected as an international autonomous legal good. \u201cHeritage is one idea. It is a \n\nphilosophical idea, a legal concept, as is something that we need to conserve\u201d (Sobrino \n\n2012:4). \n\nThe evolution of the international community, the vital value of this state of the Earth \n\nSystem and the heritage dimension derived from the need to transmit it to future \n\ngenerations enable the recognition of something higher in scale than a concern or an \n\ninterest that should be legally protected as an autonomous legal good. \n\n\n\n 108 \n\nThe evolution of a living space \u201cconcern\u201d towards a common intangible natural \n\nheritage of humankind as an authentic autonomous legal good seems a crucial conceptual \n\nadvance for the organization of human relations, which have broadened to a global scale. \n\nWith the scientific \u201csafe operating space\u201d, the legal concept of the living space could have \n\na value that can be measured. \n\nAs Sobrino (2012:5) stated,  \n\nI think this idea, to being more than an idea, must institutionalize itself (\u2026) If we \n\ncombine the idea of heritage with the idea of an international authority and place \n\nrelative competences on it \u2013 not many are needed, apart from certain ones to \n\nestablish a multilateral framework for action \u2013 I think that would resolve many of \n\nthe current tensions. \n\nThe legal concept of heritage can be the locus for that vital good, the living intangible \n\nspace, represented by the safe operating space, and at the same time to be the support for \n\na global organization. \n\nWhat is certain is that a purely formal legal approach towards the current notion of the \n\nCHM will exclude the maintenance of this Earth System state within the biogeophysical \n\ncharacteristics of the Holocene. The protection of a certain state of the Earth System can \n\nonly be legally framed by proceeding with an axiological and teleological interpretation \n\nat the basis of the legal consecration of the CHM and its substitute derived concepts. \n\nArvid Pardo's vision that gave origin to the concept of CHM involved the perception \n\nof the \u201cocean environment as an integrated fluid ecological system\u201d and the concern \u201cthat \n\ncontinued, unmanaged use of the world\u2019s oceans would become a serious threat to \n\ninternational peace and security from the environmental impact of new technologies, the \n\nmilitarization of the seafloor and expanding state claims to jurisdiction over large parts \n\nof the oceans\u201d.11 \n\nTo realize these objectives through the legal regime of the CHM involves \n\ndistinguishing the system concept and its intrinsic intangible quality from the territorial \n\nand geographical approach of already existing legal concepts. But as Taylor &amp; Stroud \n\n(2012, 19) state, \u201cArvid Pardo (and others) considered the CHM regime flexible enough \n\nto adapt to the emerging challenges, the discovery of new resources and values, such as \n\nscientific research\u201d. \n\nDeparting from this approach, unrealized due to theoretical and practical \n\nimpossibilities at the time, we will try to adjust the initial intentions of the CHM to the \n\n\n\n 109 \n\ncurrent criteria for the intrinsic unit of the Earth System. While the artificial separation \n\nbetween oceans, climate and biodiversity may be necessary for reasons of task \n\norganization, this lower level of operation should not conceal the need for intervention in \n\nthe protection of biogeophysical conditions at the higher-level integration of the Earth \n\nSystem. This intervention can be put into practice through application of international \n\nstandards on the quality of the Earth System state realized by the approach of the \n\nplanetary boundaries. \n\nNonetheless, it is of interest to understand that all the substitutes and derived concepts \n\ngravitating around the CHM seek to plant a seed for the development of a normative \n\nframework that offers alternatives to governing the global common goods, and not only \n\nthe areas and resources beyond its jurisdictions. So, in order for the CHM to become an \n\noperational/normative concept, its object needed to be deterritorialised and made to \n\ncoincide with the initial concepts and premises formulated by Arvid Pardo. \n\nThe entire range of more or less indeterminate concepts pursue the same unique end, \n\nthe reason for their existence being the absence of instruments that could somehow \n\nconstitute an object of intellectual representation of reality, in this case the Earth System \n\nas a whole within a state that supports the living space. It is therefore crucial to understand \n\nin detail the differences between the concept of CHM and the CCH derived from it. Based \n\non the proposal of Murillo (2008), we will compare them with recent knowledge \n\nregarding the safe operating space for humankind and how they may be re-framed so as \n\nto correspond to recent scientific evolutions. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 110 \n\nTERRITORIAL \n\nSCOPE \n\nCHM \nAreas beyond national jurisdiction and its \n\nresources  \n\nCCH \n\nA wider scope \u2013 applied in the intangible higher \n\nlevel, both beyond national jurisdiction but also \n\nwithin the jurisdiction of states. \n\nSUBJECT SCOPE \n\nCHM \nThe main focus is related to the geographical areas \n\nbeyond national jurisdiction and its resources.  \n\nCCH \n\nFocused in functional intangible spaces that are a \n\n\u201cconcern\u201d to humanity as whole. At present, the \n\nmatters are climate change, species in danger and \n\nconservation of biodiversity. \n\nThe intrinsic intangible ecological quality does not \n\nexist autonomously on the geographical space. \n\nTherefore, the CCH continues without a clear and \n\nprecise definition, liable to generate rights and \n\nduties. \n\nDISTRIBUTIVE \n\nSCOPE \n\n \n\nCHM Equitable sharing of benefits. \n\nCCH \nEquitable sharing of burdens \u2013 cooperation and \n\nproblem solving. \n\n \n\nFigure 6. Differences between Common Heritage of Mankind (CHM) and Common \n\nConcern of Humankind (CCH)  \n\n \n\nFrom the analysis of different perspectives of the approach that considers the Earth \n\nSystem as a unique systemic whole with intrinsic limits regarding its state, we are able to \n\nidentify the following advantages and disadvantages. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 111 \n\n \n\n \n\nTERRITORIAL SCOPE \n\nThe CCH offers a more adequate \n\nresponse to the characteristics of the \n\nEarth System both in and outside \n\nsovereignties. But it has the \n\ndisadvantage of not having a locus, \n\nunlike the CHM, so it cannot be \n\nattached to a space on which an \n\norganization can be built. \n\nSUBJECT SCOPE \n\nThe CHM carries the advantage of \n\nbeing able to delimit the area or \n\nresource in question, while the CCH has \n\na problem with the intangibility of the \n\nobject.  \n\n \n\nDISTRIBUTIVE SCOPE \n\n \n\nFrom the perspective of the Earth \n\nSystem, damages and benefits, caused \n\nand produced upon the Earth System as \n\na whole, are shared.  \n\n \n\nFigure 7. Comparative Analysis of Common Heritage of Mankind and Common \n\nConcern of Humankind  \n\n \n\nIn summary, we can say that while one has a locus and does not possess an appropriate \n\nterritorial scope, the other has the appropriate territorial scope but does not have a locus. \n\nIn regard to the distributive scope, the sum of both may adequately address the \n\ncharacteristics of globally shared damages and benefits at the level of the Earth System. \n\nIn this sense, the combination of some of the characteristics of both concepts may \n\nbring the necessary advances in law and international relations with the objective to \n\nconstructing an institutional architecture more adapted to the environmental living space \n\nin response to a collective concern of humanity. \n\n \n\n\n\n 112 \n\n4.9. An Evolutional Legal Living Space \n\n \nBoth concepts of living space of the CCH and the safe operating space of humankind \n\nmaintain the common characteristic of being intangible non-territorial spaces regarding \n\nthe biogeochemical conditions of a certain state of the Earth System that supported \n\nfavourable conditions for human life on Earth. However, their origins are different \u2013 one \n\nlegal, the other scientific. This primordial nature is found on the level of the meta-heritage \n\nor constituent heritage (Soromenho-Marques 2006), an intangible natural heritage that is \n\nthe fundamental basis for the intelligibility of all other types of tangible natural heritage \n\nalready known. It is represented by the processes of life or the major circulatory element \n\nflows, which in a previous analogy was referred to as the software relationship of the \n\nEarth System. \n\nAs a concept, \u2018state\u2019, which is profoundly rooted within territorial space, does not \n\ninclude the global software that supports the life system on Earth. The \u2018safe operating \n\nspace for humankind\u2019, as the best available integrated piece of scientific information with \n\nthe capacity to elaborate on emerging phenomena in a systemic way, may constitute a \n\nkeystone of this announced evolution. The question then becomes whether this scientific \n\ninstrument is sufficient to represent the multiple realities of the Earth System as a whole \n\nand in an immutable way. \n\nAlthough there is still uncertainty regarding the quantification of limits and the \n\nexistence of planetary limits, they are clear and entirely consistent with the science of \n\ncomplex systems. As we cannot \u201caspire to a immutability of physical biological and \n\nchemical elements\u201d (Canotilho 1991:123), it will be necessary to operate permanently on \n\nan evolutionary flexibility. The ecological paradigm is characterised by complex \n\nprocesses, which inevitably engender uncertainty. \u201cIt is up to the law to transform this \n\necological uncertainty into a social certainty\u201d (Morand 1995:212). \n\nIn this sense, this living space will always be a scientific representation of a dynamic \n\nsystem. Therefore, the instrument used for its interpretation will also need to be flexible, \n\ndynamic and evolving, allowing a dialogue between the human species and the Earth \n\nSystem that we are part of. The creation of a new international intangible space, while \n\nfounded in an ever-developing science, will have to be founded on a socially constructed \n\n\"value\" that will guarantee its existence independent from scientific evolutions on the \n\nEarth System. \n\n\n\n 113 \n\nThe important thing will be the concept that there is an intangible living space, both in \n\nand outside sovereignties. Considering present scientific knowledge, this corresponds to \n\nthe safe operating space of the Holocene, but the concrete definition of limits and \n\nelements to be taken into account within this socially constructed space will evolve along \n\nthe line of continuous, evolutionary and dynamic knowledge on the Earth System. \n\nOnce again, as Morin (1990:8) states, complex thought \u201chas no intent to replace the \n\nambition of simple thinking, which is to control and dominate the real. It is a thought \n\nexperiment that is capable of handling the real, and negotiate and enter in dialogue with \n\nit\u201d. \n\nThe key will be to find an instrument that represents the known reality of the Earth \n\nSystem, allowing us to enter in dialogue with it. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.10. Applying CHM to the Earth System \n\n \nFrom the initial intentions and derived concepts that evolved from the CHM concept \n\nwill result a new legal object based on the fundamental separation between the res \n\nincorporales relative to the intangible dimension, qualitative and functional of the Earth \n\nSystem (higher level of integration), and the res corporals, referring to the territorial \n\nspaces (land, oceans and areal space, i.e., the lower level of integration) in which these \n\nfunctions and qualities develop. \n\nIn this sense, we advance a proposal for an evolution incorporating the combined \n\nelements for an axiological interpretation of CHM applied to the Earth System: \n\n \n\n\u2022 The biogeophysical structure of the Holocene period is part of the international \n\ncommon heritage (patrimony) and therefore belongs to all humanity in common. \n\nThis means it cannot be owned, enclosed or disposed of (i.e., appropriated) by any \n\nstate/s or entity. As a commons it can be used, but not owned, either as private or \n\ncommon property or via the claim of sovereign rights; \n\n\u2022 The use of the common heritage framework shall be carried out in accordance \n\nwith a system of cooperative management, for the benefit of all humanity (or \n\ncommon good). This has been interpreted as creating a type of trust relationship, \n\nwith states acting as trustees for the benefit of all humanity (i.e., for the common \n\n\n\n 114 \n\ngood, not for the exclusive benefit of states/private entities) including future \n\ngenerations, taking into account the particular needs and interests of developing \n\nstates (intra-generational equity); \n\n\u2022 There exists a permanent sharing of damage and benefits realized over the state \n\nof the Earth System. It will be necessary to construct an accounting system in \n\norder to account for the contributions of each state towards the desired state of the \n\nEarth System, and next develop an equitable system of derived compensations for \n\nthe different uses of the CHM; \n\n\u2022 A global entity should be created with exclusive functions in coordination of \n\ncompensations and the development of projects for the maintenance of this \n\ncommon heritage of mankind. \n\n \n\nTERRITORIAL \n\nSCOPE \n\nScope \nThe Earth System as a whole \u2013 applied both \n\nbeyond and within the jurisdiction of States. \n\nForm of \n\nRepresentation \n\nThe higher level of Earth System \n\nintegration.

Features of a possible evolution of CHM/CCH to a Common Intangible Natural Heritage of \n\nHumankind \n\n \n\nThis possible pathway of the natural heritage, from the \u201cmaterially and geographically \n\ndefinable\u201d to the \u201cimmaterial and intangible\u201d, is similar to the consolidation of cultural \n\nheritage. The importance of cultural heritage was consecrated in UNESCO's Convention \n\nconcerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage in 1972, but 30 years \n\nlater it was acknowledged that cultural heritage cannot be limited to what can be seen or \n\ntouched, so immaterial heritage was included in the Convention for the Safeguarding of \n\nIntangible Cultural Heritage in 2003. \n\nThe time has now come for intangible nature to be recognized as a vital resource for \n\nall humankind \u2013 a common intangible natural heritage of humankind. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.11. Conclusion \n\n \n\nIt is now recognized in the current doctrine that international law is not yet equipped \n\nto handle the ecological goods that exist simultaneously in and outside of all states. There \n\nexists a structural, theoretical flaw in the approach to the global \u201cwhole\u201d. This flaw \n\nextends to the time dimension of the chain of successive human generations. The global \n\ncommons have always been (and continue to be) understood as geographical spaces that \n\nonly exist outside the political borders of states. Likewise, humanity and its future \n\ngenerations, despite being repeatedly referred to in international conventions, do not \n\npossess a legal status that corresponds with an efficient protection. \n\nThe global, diffuse and intangible dimension of a vital good such as a stable climate, \n\nexisting both within and outside all states, with the effects of the damage caused upon it \n\nextending over several generations, transformed this traditional approach into an \n\necological nonsense. The dysfunctionality of existing legal instruments not only has long \n\nsince been detected but has also been the object of several attempts to build concepts, \n\nwhich, however, are soon found to be inoperative, with no legal consequences in terms \n\nof rights and duties. \n\n\n\n 116 \n\nAlongside the increasing understanding of the functioning of the Earth System, \n\ntogether with the possibility to measure its state through the planetary boundaries, a giant \n\nleap was taken towards the unravelling of the nebula composed of legally vague and \n\nundefined concepts disseminated in national and international legal texts. International \n\nLaw expressions such as the common concern of mankind, common interest, life-support \n\nsystem, intergeneration equity, ecological integrity and sustainable development can now \n\nbe sustained by a pattern of indicators that may be used to translate and delineate the lack \n\nof legal definitions, opening up new perspectives in the construction of solutions that will \n\novercome the dysfunctionality between the ecological reality and the existing legal \n\nframework. \n\nThese vital factors, translated through these indicators, as they are global and diffuse, \n\nare still legally non-existent and considered \u201cexternal\u201d to social organization. They are \n\nthe known economic externalities, either positive (regulating ecosystem services) or \n\nnegative (pollution). \n\nThe concept of the common heritage of mankind has stayed tied to the geographical \n\nareas of political division between states. Until now, World Heritage has only been \n\napplied to goods that, despite their outstanding universal value from an aesthetic or \n\nscientific point of view, are found within the geographical area of a state. \n\n These two legal concepts (CHM and WH) will possess a greater potential for \n\nevolution towards instruments capable of protecting this vital and global good, and their \n\nsum can cover the geographical area in which the Earth System operates. The World \n\nHeritage has already made the shift from tangible cultural heritage towards intangible \n\ncultural heritage. It seems that we can now reproduce this pathway in regard to the natural \n\nheritage (Arag\u00e3o 2016). So, being in the possession of a way to represent a favourable \n\nstate of the Earth System through the structure of biogeochemical concentrations that \n\nremained relatively stable over the last 11,700 years \u2013 the Holocene period \u2013 we propose \n\nthe recognition of a well-defined state of the Earth System as a world natural intangible \n\nheritage of mankind. This new natural intangible heritage should be the locus on which \n\nto construct a system for the management and maintenance of Earth System use. Upon \n\nestablishing rules applying to the use of the Earth System, we are also securing the \n\nminimum conditions for the dignity of future generations. But before undertaking \n\ninstitutional reform, we need a concept that allows for a solution that will fill the gap \n\nbetween the theory underlying the organization of international institutions and the reality \n\nof Earth System dynamics. \n\n\n\n 117 \n\nThis is a structural prerequisite to building the equity and trust needed for collective \n\naction. In this sense, it will be a structural instrument for the application of human rights. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n 118 \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 5 \n \n\nEarth Condominium \u2013 A legal model for the Anthropocene \n \n \n\u201cIt seems that the human mind has first to construct forms independently before we can \nfind them in things.\u201d \n\n \nAlbert Einstein \n\n \n\n \n\n5.1. Political Impossibility? \n\n \nIn a seminar organized by the Academy of Environmental Law (IUCN), Simone Borg \n\n(2001) presented a paper with the title \u201cClimate Change as a Common Concern of \n\nHumankind.\u201d In it he posed two fundamental questions: \n\n1) Is it necessary to identify the legal status of climate? \n\n2) Will we gain anything from doing so? \n\nWe have accepted that the good to be put under the protection of the law is not only \n\nthe climate but a well-defined state of the Earth System, as Olfield and Steffen (2004) \n\nhave already demonstrated. Now, it seems to us that any satisfactory attempt to answer \n\nthese questions can only be made if we first answer another question asked by Alexander \n\nKiss (1982.121) on the definition of res communis: \u201cOf course, one may question the \n\nexact meaning of this concept: is it a common sovereignty, a co-ownership, a \n\ncondominium? We must recognize that this question has never been solved in a \n\ncompletely satisfactory manner \u2013 that is precisely one of the major arguments of the \n\nadvocates of the conception res nullius.\u201d \n\nThis statement redirects the point from the need to recognize a legal status for the \n\nclimate or the Earth System to the real crux of the issue: whether there is a legal \n\nframework able to receive and integrate a new legal status with respect to a good that is \n\n\n\n 119 \n\nsimultaneously inside and outside of all sovereignties. The problem is establishing the \n\ntype of res communis of this new legal good, and that will be decisive in its new legal \n\nstatus being, or not, compatible and integrated in the existing legal framework. It is in the \n\nabsence of a clear definition of what a \u201cglobal common good\u201d is exactly, that is, what is \n\nthe res communis ommnium which is not restricted to the global commons but spans also \n\nacross areas subject to national jurisdiction (Borg 2007), that creates the breeding ground \n\nin which all uncertainties can germinate. This absence is the epicentre of our legal nebula, \n\nour confusion, our legal black hole through which the most vital factors for our future \n\ndisappear. Awareness has been growing that the term common concern can only express \n\nour embarrassment, our incapacity to define in a simple manner, to name in a clear way \n\nor capture with words a vague terrain of ideas. \n\nWhen one states that the common concern was the fall-back solution because there \n\nwas no real political will to build a new legal object, this is only partially correct. In fact, \n\nwithout first identifying the legal regime of res communis needed to reconcile the intrinsic \n\ncharacteristics of the new legal object with the existing international legal framework, \n\neven if there had been political will to recognize the existence of a new legal good, the \n\nresult would probably not have been very different from the existent incompatibilities \n\nthat continue to relegate CHM to the ever- smaller remaining parts of jurisdictions, and \n\nthe CCH for a future always postponed. \n\nA desirable conservation of the Earth System cannot be regulated effectively if it is \n\nbased only on international laws sustained purely on interstate consent and reciprocity. A \n\nnew legal framework must be built that ensures also the protection and promotion of \n\ncommon interests by representing the interests of all humankind. Without this, vital \n\nfactors will continue to be perceived as concerns, or will conflict with ecological \n\nnonsense2 approaches. The question \u201cHow can we admit that a good that belongs to no \n\none may be governed by a specific law?\u201d (Kiss 1982:122) implies understanding what \n\ntheoretical legal framework is more able to explain and receive this new object of law. If \n\nthe basic statement that the absence of ownership is synonymous with not being governed \n\nand therefore being a res nullius is correct, how is it possible that a new global legal \n\nobject, called here the favourable state of the Earth System, can come into being and be \n\nruled in a context of a fragmented territorial sovereignty without any legal representation \n\nof a global res communis? \n\nThe remaining ecological space (Rockstrom 2014), scientifically represented by the \n\nsafe operating space for humankind of planetary boundaries and the living space as the \n\n\n\n 120 \n\nnon-territorial space of the CCH, \u201ccan be considered as a fine-tuned version of the res \n\ncommunis status of global natural resources in light of the contemporary developments\u201d \n\n(Borg 2009:4). This view could also correspond with the problem of res communis \n\ndefinition, as reported by Kiss. But perhaps the main response to Borg\u2019s original question \n\nis the need of the good to belong to someone in order to be ruled and not be a res nullius. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.2. Two Different Levels of the Earth System, Two Different Levels of \nHuman Relations \n \n \n\nIf we need to change our relationship with our life-supporting system from exploitation \n\nto stewardship, humanity has to self-organize within this remaining living space and \n\nensure its maintenance in a well-functioning condition. This means that the main task is \n\nthe internal organization between all the users of the same resource on a global scale. This \n\nfact puts humanity in the unavoidable position of relating internally in two different \n\nscales. This means that it will be in the way the Earth System is used that the relationships \n\nbetween all communities and individuals will be established.  \n\nLike all complex systems, the Earth System has two levels of integration, a lower level \n\nof component parts and processes and a higher level that constitutes the whole system \n\nwith its emergent properties that cannot be understood or described by simply aggregating \n\nthe component parts up the global level. The first level is related to the geographical area, \n\nthat is, the heterogeneous physical planet with 510 million km2 on which different state \n\nsovereignties operate and that is also the locus, the hardware of the Earth System. The \n\nhigher level (the Earth System itself) is intangible as it arises from the global \n\ninterconnections and emerging phenomena through which global human relations are \n\nmediated. This higher level developed in an evolutionary fashion throughout Earth's \n\nhistory and it is through this evolutionary process involving the living part of the planet \n\nas well as the geophysical that, for example, the relative concentrations of gases remain \n\nrelatively constant through time. A key process of the Earth System is self-regulation, \n\nwhich consists of feedback loops formed by component parts of the system (both inside \n\nand outside of all sovereignty and incapable of any legal abstraction of division) that work \n\nsynergistically to keep the system in well-defined states. \n\n\n\n 121 \n\nIn essence, it is the integration of the geophysical properties of the planet with the \n\nliving biosphere that forms the intangible Earth System, a single global system incapable \n\nof any legal abstraction of division. In this sense, the intangible Earth System is an \n\nauthentic law of nature, already described by science and recognized as the \"principles\" \n\nthat govern the natural phenomena of the system. Humanity, as an integral component of \n\nthe Earth System, is also dependent on those principles, and, as such, humanity is related \n\nto the Earth System on two distinct levels in equal terms. \n\nOn a lower level, humanity is organized as independent political communities around \n\na defined territory. On the higher level, the relationships are established and mediated \n\nthrough the use of a single common system, the Earth System, which does not exist \n\nlegally and as a consequence is unmanaged. \n\nSo the main answer to Borg\u2019s initial question has to do with the reconfiguration of \n\ninter-subjective relations between all users of the same resource. As stated by Filipe et \n\nal. (2007:84), \u201cIt is from the relationships established when carrying out the use of the \n\nresource that arise concepts as the right to common property or private property\u201d. \n\n \n\n5.3. A Heritage to Organize Relations \n\n \nSince the use of the common resource, called here the favourable state of the Earth \n\nSystem is extensive temporally and its effects are intergenerational, it is also through this \n\nresource that relationships are established between generations past, present and unborn. \n\nTheory has defined property not only by the individual\u2019s relationship with the inherent \n\ncharacteristics of the object but also to include the underlying relationship between the \n\nowner and all other individuals. According to Hang (2003), the most relevant is the \n\nrelationship between individuals, because property rights are a relationship between \n\nindividuals in relation to a resource, not a relationship between an individual and the \n\nresource\u201d. Once the use of this limited resource is not exclusive to any \"user\" and no user \n\ncan exclude access to any other, in global terms we are facing a situation of common \n\nownership extended to the scale of all humankind (Res communes ominium). From the \n\nmoment it is discovered that a resource considered inexhaustible is, after all, exhaustible, \n\ninternal relations are equally reconfigured among all users of that resource. For \n\nSchmid(1995) property rights represent a set of ordered relationships among people \n\nwhich define their opportunities, their exposure to the acts of others, their privileges and \n\n\n\n 122 \n\ntheir responsibilities for resource utilization\u201d. When the resource in question is a res \n\nincorporales relative to a certain favourable state of the Earth System that everyone \n\ndepends on, all users share the consequences of the acts of others. \n\nConstructing a system to organize each actor\u2019s privileges and responsibilities \n\nregarding the use of a resource that belongs to everyone, born and unborn, becomes a \n\nmatter of survival. \n\nTo that extent, the legal recognition of a favourable state of the Earth System as a \n\ncommon heritage of mankind should primarily result in a regulatory instrument of \n\nrelationships between individuals, states and communities. That is, if everyone has access \n\nto the good and its benefits, and no one can be excluded, we will have to answer questions \n\nlike: Who is responsible for maintaining it? and What are the rules for using it (rights and \n\nduties)? \n\nThe legal absence of the good also corresponds to a social failure, to the res nullius, \n\nthat is, the absence of rules between individuals or states on the use of the good. The \n\nperceived relevance of the underlying relations of property ownership will be the most \n\ndecisive factor in justifying the need to recognize legally the existence of the Earth \n\nSystem, and to give it a patrimonial dimension. \n\nWhen we structure global and inter-subjective relations based on the relationships \n\nestablished through the use of a common good to which is assigned a value per se, we are \n\nsimultaneously building a system to ensure its maintenance and allowing the construction \n\nof a larger global justice as they are intrinsically related. \n\nAs a result, the preservation of the new legal good should result from a collective \n\naction internally organized between the users rather than by a legal obligation. Thereby, \n\nthe new heritage shall be the mediator of a dialectical relationship developed on a global \n\nscale between social internal relations and the object (Earth System). To that extent, \n\nplanetary boundaries should not be perceived as a new prohibition but as the limits that \n\nunderlie and justify our self-organization. We can even say that the ultimate goal of \n\nacknowledging this common natural intangible heritage of humankind is the construction \n\nof a globally organized society around a common heritage, an intangible locus around \n\nwhich humankind organizes itself. \n\nIf nothing can exist in pure disorder, the survival of the human species as a whole \n\ndepends on its ability to self-organize. So, it\u2019s at the level of consequences for subjective \n\nrelationships in the internal organization between users of the common resource that the \n\n\n\n 123 \n\ngreatest justification for the legal consecration of a well-defined state of the Earth System \n\nlies. \n\nIf one accepts that the legal recognition of a favourable state of the Earth System is a \n\nbasic structural factor for the organization/regulation of the internal relations of humanity, \n\na key question remains unanswered: Will it be possible to conciliate in a symbiotic way \n\nthe existence of one global legal support (the legal status of Earth System) with the \n\nfragmented territorial sovereignty? Taking as a starting point the two levels of the existing \n\nrelations, we will try to understand which model of res communis is better able to \n\naccurately portray the facts: \"the common sovereignty, co-ownership, the \n\ncondominium?\u201d (Kiss 1982:122). \n\n \n\n5.4. Divide to Organize \n\nTaking as a starting point the unique characteristics of the climate and the Earth \n\nSystem as a whole, and the alternatives presented by Kiss (1982), it seems that the \n\nhypotheses of both common sovereignty and co-ownership imply the maintenance of the \n\nidea that there is a separation between what is within the borders and the res communis, \n\nwhich corresponds with the leftover areas of the division. In this sense, none of these \n\nmodels seem to have the necessary characteristics to be able to deal satisfactorily with \n\nthe problem of activities affecting negatively an Intangible Natural Resource, which \n\nspans across and beyond the national territories of States (Borg 2009). This overlap of \n\ninterests between the private interests of states and the interests of all humanity has an \n\ninherent condition of interdependence: it is mutually beneficial or mutually destructive. \n\nThe problem of reconciling seemingly opposing interests in a situation of symbiotic \n\ninterdependence is not new to legal sciences, and it was structured through a private law \n\nfigure that defines the situation where a materially indivisible thing, or a thing with a \n\nunitary structure, belongs to various co-owners where each one has private or exclusive \n\nrights of ownership over determined fractions and at the same time, are co-owners of the \n\nparts of the building, which constitutes its common structure. This juridical figure is \n\nknown as a condominium. \n\nIn order for this model to transform a theoretical impossibility into a solution, it was \n\nnecessary to innovate and not be limited by the application of pre-existing forms of \n\ndominium. Once neither private property nor co-ownership could deal with the \n\nrelationships established through the ownership and use of a materially indivisible \n\n\n\n 124 \n\nbuilding, the condominium was invented. First it accepted the unitary and indivisible \n\nnature of a building and then built a system that would adapt to this seemingly \n\nunsurpassable circumstance. It argued against what was previously considered to be \n\nirrefutable and created a model of ownership that cannot be associated with any other \n\nform of ownership. As magistrate Lu\u00eds Hernanz Cano (1998:41) says, Spanish \n\njurisprudence has perceived horizontal property as \u201cspecial property\u201d or \u201ccomplex \n\nproperty\u201d. Its accurate designations are clearly a sign of its complexity: \u201chouse by \n\nstoreys\u201d, \u201ccondominium of storeys\u201d, \u201cpro indivisio communities\u201d, autonomous fraction\u201d, \n\nand \u201ccommunity with rights in rem\u201d (Cano 1998: 41). The motive for such complexity is \n\nthe coexistence of apparently contradictory and antagonistic elements, which, if \n\nconsidered superficially, may create the supposition that the presence of one implies the \n\nabsence of the other and is hardly translatable in the reductive language of definitions. \n\nThe urgent need for a solution led to one capable of combining within the same \n\nmaterially indivisible building a separation that allows several individuals to use the same \n\nfloor as housing. Additionally, it envisages: a) that each individual has a unique right to \n\nownership of a fraction of the building, making possible the legal trade of these \n\nproperties; b) the existence of a system of contributions to ensure the maintenance of \n\nsystems of common use (water, electricity, elevators) and the parts that are legally and \n\nmaterially impossible to divide (stairs, roof, structure, etc.), which must all be maintained \n\nin a dependable state. \n\nThe model of the condominium, or complex property, is not a community or an \n\narithmetic sum of individual properties. It is something complex that elevates the law to \n\nthe art of reconciling the extremes, of making symbiotically dependent what was \n\napparently incompatible (Magalh\u00e3es 2007:87). \n\nAlthough with some nuances, this theoretical model has been used recurrently \n\nthroughout history in international law, in situations of shared rivers, small islands, \n\nterritorial enclaves, territories under dispute and in undefined political situations or even \n\nat the level of small communities wishing to establish access to certain resources related \n\nto rural activities. Even the Antarctica Treaty System of 1959 is considered by some as a \n\nde facto condominium (Glennon 1991), since it is not a sovereign territory (although \n\nvarious nations claim parts of its territory as their own) and provides voting authority for \n\n28 nations to jointly govern the area. In all, 50 countries are part of the \u201ccondominium\u201d \n\nalthough some consider it a \u201cquasi-condominium\u201d (Hemmings 2014). \n\n\n\n 125 \n\nThe use of civil juridical institutes originating from national laws is not new in \n\ninternational law. For some authors it is even recommended. Weeramantry (2000:195) \n\npoints out that: \n\nIn view of the speed of progress and of technology, the national laws and \n\ninternational law should follow the movement and increase their productive and \n\nadaptive ability. New concepts and procedures should rapidly be sought to confront \n\nthe new situations, which are a result of technology\u2019s progress. For this effect, \n\ninternational law should firstly be aware of all the essential traditions of the \n\ndifferent civilizations and adopt a multicultural attitude. Numerous principles of \n\ninternational law, which will be adopted in the future, may be released from the \n\ntraditional juridical systems existent in the world and through which international \n\nlaw may receive its strength and inspiration. \n\nThe change from the soft law to the hard law should be accelerated, thus making \n\ninternational law more fit to adapt itself to the needs of our time. National laws will \n\ntake advantage of the norms and of the universal patterns, which will equally \n\nimprove the internal systems. \n\nIn the classical approach, commons management is doomed to the fate of the \"tragedy \n\nof the commons\". Hardin\u2019s work transformed a growing pessimism around the \n\n\u201ccommons\u201d into a global scale pessimism, also called by some doctrines as the \u201ctragedy \n\nof the common heritage of mankind\" (Shackelford 2008). It considers \u201ccommunal \n\nsovereignty may be seen as a temporary placeholder that exists until technology enables \n\noccupation of property making it worthwhile for States to assert national sovereignty in \n\nthe oldest traditions of the Westphalian system\u201d. In this view, \u201cestablishing property \n\nrights has been commonly seen in the Western world as the solution to commons \n\nmanagement; once occupation of a territory is possible, then property rights become \n\nnecessary to catalyze development\u201d (Shackelford 2008:120). This heads to the still-\n\ndominant doctrine that points out as a unique solution the division and privatization of \n\nthe good. However, ecological interdependence has shown that it is necessary to develop \n\na new theory to explain phenomena that do not fit in a dichotomous world divided \n\nbetween individual/state interests and collective/humanity interests. In an attempt to \n\ndevelop legal or economic instruments to involve collective interests, the conditions that \n\nblock a class action or give rise to a conflict are recognized.  \n\n\n\n 126 \n\nIn his analysis of the strategy of conflict, Schelling (1960), winner of the Nobel Prize \n\nfor Economics and one of the fathers of the theory of games, showed that many social \n\ninteractions can be seen as non-cooperative games that involve both common and \n\nconflicting interests. In fact, Schelling sought to consolidate the idea that almost any \n\nproblem involving the decisions of more than one person simultaneously contains \n\nelements of conflict and common interest. It is in the apparent contradiction of the \n\nsymbiotic relationship between individual and collective interests (masterfully defined by \n\nKant, \u201cOnly in the pursuit of common interests can we guarantee our individual rights)\u201d4 \n\nthat we will try to reinterpret the analyses already carried out on the structural paradox of \n\nthese interrelationships, which are exercised in an mutually advantageous form or a failed \n\ncoordination would give rise to high costs for all parties (Filipe et al. 2007). The \n\ncondominium transforms dichotomous dogma into accidental truth, and achieves, without \n\ndenying the classic solution of division, the integration and symbiotic unification with the \n\ncommon property. \n\nThe big news is that although the condominium divides in order to organize the \n\ndifferent tasks and responsibilities, these are carried out not only to define distinct private \n\nproperties but also to distinguish all private properties from parts and systems that are in \n\na regime of common ownership. It is precisely through the distinction between different \n\ntypes of ownership over the same materially undivided good that this form of \u201ccomplex \n\nproperty\u201d can harmonise the different private and common interests, making this overlap \n\nof properties perfectly symbiotic. \n\nSeparation is managed through a legal abstraction, allowing the existence, within each \n\nindividual fraction, of elements that appear to be private but are actually common (e.g., \n\nmain walls, structure, exterior walls, roofs, water distribution system, and electricity). \n\nThe operation is not just a mere division of spaces but a division with qualitative and \n\nfunctional criteria regarding the intrinsic nature of the different elements in a building. \n\nThe criterion on which this approach is based is that all those constituent and \n\nfunctional elements whose lack of maintenance implies damage for all owners of \n\nindividual properties within the building should be integrated into the co-ownership \n\nregime. That is, common parts are all parts of a building that cannot be materially \n\nassigned to only one owner, as well as all elements and systems that are decisive for the \n\noperation and security of the entire building, obliging all to participate in their \n\nmaintenance. \n\n\n\n 127 \n\nOnly through a clear identification of what those elements are and what is under \n\ncommon ownership is it possible to establish a system that ensures the maintenance of \n\nthe common parts together with the systems and services that are of common interest. In \n\nother words, only the precise definition of all the elements that are in co-ownership will \n\nmake possible to assign responsibility for the management and maintenance of such \n\nproperty, and create a contribution system among all the owners in pursuit of common \n\ninterests. \n\nThe process of this theoretical construction was not a conceptual process that was then \n\napplied to the good, dividing it arbitrarily. On the contrary, it departed from the unitary \n\ncharacter of the property, identified the elements that by their nature are essential to \n\nmaintaining the structure and operation of the building, and considered as private all those \n\nspaces and goods whose individual ownership does not pose a problem to the unitary and \n\nfunctional characteristics of the common good. \n\nThis overlap between private interest and communal interests assumes that every \n\nhomeowner simultaneously pursues private property rights on their fraction and co-\n\nownership of common elements, having the right and obligation to participate in decisions \n\nconcerning the management of common interests. \u201cThis duality of rights \u2013 private \n\nownership and co-ownership of common elements \u2013 will definitely mark the unique and \n\noriginal character of this legal model. As in all situations where the antitheses touch and \n\ncomplement each other, there is a fertile field for searching for appropriate definitions \n\nand explanations of a reality that is complex\u201d (Magalh\u00e3es 2007:86). \n\nSpanish jurisprudence considered it to be an authentic masterpiece of legal \n\nconstruction after 1960: \n\nThe ownership of homes by storeys is an institution of a complex nature, whose \n\ntype is the right to ownership, but within it, it constitutes a class detached from the \n\ntraditional ones, and it is useless to search for similarities or partial identity since \n\nthere is no community because of the private elements belonging to various owners; \n\nnor does servitude help to explain the situation of all the common things, but merely \n\ndetermines relations which only exist between the owners of two or more storeys, \n\nbut which affect everyone. \n\nAs Hang (2003) understands, the most relevant is the relationship between individuals. \n\nMore important than any similarity regarding the type of the good or its scale is the \n\nstructure of relationships that arise around the ownership or use of a particular materially \n\n\n\n 128 \n\nindivisible good. In this regard, also in terms of the scale of the Earth System as a whole, \n\nthe most important point to understand is the structure of relationships established \n\nthrough the common use of the same global and unitary system, the Earth System, so that \n\na legal abstraction cannot divide it. \n\nAssuming that the ecological problem is not a malfunction of the Earth System but \n\nrather a poor adaptation of human society to its functioning, it seems to us that the path \n\nto a possible solution, rather than ideological or techno/scientific choice, should be a \n\ntechnical answer in the social sciences with special resort to law. Here we mean law not \n\nas a system of sanctions and prohibitions but rather in its prior function of organization \n\nand regulation of human relations but widened to a global scale. \n\n \n\n5.5. Divide to Unite \n\n All spaces that have become accessible to humans throughout history have been \n\nsubject to their legal definition. The possibility of humanity as a whole to become a \n\ngeological force capable of changing the state of the Earth System requires that the \n\nintangible non-territorial space, the living space, represented through the core drivers of \n\nthe state of the Earth System, becomes a safe space where its use is subject to order. \n\n The problem arises because this new space has a new character, not geographical and \n\nterritorial, distinguishable and therefore completely distinct from all other spaces \n\npreviously discovered, even when compared to space exploration where the existence of \n\nintangible natural resources is already recognized today. This non-spatial space is not \n\nexternal to the planet but part of the Earth System, and is present inside and outside of all \n\nsovereignty, creating an inextricable link between the activities of states within national \n\nterritory and its effects on climate (...) an unprecedented situation in international law \n\n(Borg 2007). It is from this overlap that the need for international law innovation (Prieur \n\n2012) comes, regarding the still- dominant view that represents reality only under an optic \n\nthat what is common to all humankind are the remaining areas of territorial political \n\ndivisions. A clear distinction between this new intangible space and the territorial \n\ngeographical space is only possible through the use of the latest scientific knowledge on \n\nthe functioning of the Earth System as a whole. The possible legal definition of this new \n\nspace and the resulting regulatory order of its use constitute per se a change in the \n\nconceptual paradigm of the international legal system. This innovation, because it is \n\nstructural, implies a theoretical framework that allows an overlapping of legal regimes \n\n\n\n 129 \n\nbetween the res corporales concerning the sovereign territorial spaces of states and the \n\nnatural res incorporales concerning the global living space, that is, the qualitative \n\ndimension of the structure of biogeochemical concentrations of oceans or the atmosphere, \n\nwhich are global and impossible to divide by any legal abstraction. \n\n It is this overlap between the territorial space of sovereignty and the global intangible \n\nspace of the living space that requires clarification of the type of res communis better able \n\nto portray the reality where tangible and intangible spaces overlap and affect human \n\nrelations. The fact that the system is common and indivisible, that all people have equal \n\naccess to it and no one is able to exclude any other from using it, is exposed to all others \n\nby virtue of sharing globally the damages, which in turn also result in very different uses, \n\nrequires us to look at this deep interdependence from a legal perspective. Everything \n\nbecomes even more complex when, for the same reasons, the benefits realized by the \n\necological infrastructure in the state of Earth System are equally shared by all on a global \n\nscale. \n\n The distinction made by the Roman legal system between source and resource can be \n\nextremely useful in clarifying the structure of the relationships resulting from different \n\nuses of the common system. As we have already stated, \u201cres communis differs from res \n\nnullius in that the source of resources cannot be appropriated but the resources \n\nthemselves are amenable to appropriation\u201d (Oosterlinck 1996:2). \n\nThe favourable state of the Earth System resulted from an evolutionary process \n\nthroughout Earth's history involving the interactions between the living biosphere of the \n\nplanet and the geophysical part, that is, the ecological infrastructures are the sources of \n\nthis favourable state, and that allowed the development of human civilization. The \n\nresource is the favourable intangible structure of biogeochemical concentrations on the \n\nEarth System. In other words, the resource emerged from the interactions of the sources. \n\n Conversely, in this situation, by its very nature, the source is appropriable (the \n\necological infrastructures are under the territorial jurisdiction of states) but not the \n\nresource, that is, the resource is dispersed all over the planet and its appropriation is \n\nphysically impossible, as is any legal abstraction of division. In this regard, although the \n\nsources are under state jurisdiction, with territorial jurisdiction over the areas where the \n\necological structures exist, the benefits realized by these structures in the state of Earth \n\nSystem (resource) are inevitably common. \n\n On the other hand, if all states use the system, all of them have sources that contribute \n\nto the maintenance of that favourable state. However, the disparity between areas and the \n\n\n\n 130 \n\nperformance of different ecosystems on qualitative and quantitative levels generate large \n\ndifferences between states with regard to positive contributions to the maintenance of that \n\nfavourable state. If we add to this discrepancy the differences between different uses, we \n\nfall into a chasm of inequality. \n\n This really is a truly new situation in the history of international law, and neither a \n\nstate-centred sovereignty nor communal sovereignty (in an isolated way) can read the \n\nrelationships established through the use of the same indivisible common system. \n\nThe tension generated by the interdependence of benefits and harms shared on a global \n\nscale in a juxtaposition of interests is a complex equation that requires a complex solution, \n\nwhich does not sit well with the simplified concept of geographic territorial division. \n\n In terms of buildings, the success of the condominium model was due largely to the \n\ndual approach of the internal differentiation. It not only used a spatial criterion in order \n\nto internally distinguish the private spaces of the common spaces but functional criteria, \n\neven within the private spaces, that identified certain elements which, due to their \n\ncharacteristics and functions, impacted the safety and functional units of the building. \n\nThese would have to be regarded as common since, if the maintenance was not provided \n\nby the private owner, the damages would be collective. By overlapping different legal \n\nregimes (private and co-ownership) and simultaneous use of spatial and functional \n\ncriteria, it is possible to ensure the autonomy of private property symbiotically with the \n\nfunctional unit of the building. This dualistic approach to the internal differentiation of \n\ncomplex property in respect of buildings can be summarized as follows: \n\n \n\nBuildings: \n \n\na) Space division \u2013 Division of the spaces between each private fraction and division \n\nbetween the sum of all the private fractions and the remaining parts that are \n\nmaterially indivisible (we refer here to the stairs, common corridors, roof, \n\nentrance, etc.). \n\nb) Functional division \u2013 Non-spatial division, whose criteria is the functional \n\ncharacter of the building components regardless of their location being within or \n\noutside the private fractions. Technically, these components are materially \n\nindivisible, and it is not even possible to carry out a legal abstraction for division. \n\nIn these situations, these components with common functions are mixed within \n\nthe private spaces, creating an overlap of legal regimes. Any attempt to materially \n\n\n\n 131 \n\nor legally divide these components would result in the loss of their functionality \n\n(we refer here to the building support structure, supporting walls, water supply \n\nsystems, drainage, electricity system, communications, etc.). \n\nIf the approach to the legal organization of buildings had stayed purely spatial, all \n\ncomponents essential to the proper functioning of the building within private fractions \n\nwould be private. That means that the cost of its maintenance would be private but the \n\nbenefits would inevitably be collective. As a result, there would be no maintenance of \n\ncommon functional components, which could lead to a collective tragedy. Without \n\nadequate legal solutions to the factual circumstances of buildings, the towns we know \n\ntoday, although technically possible, would be a political impossibility. \n\nThe legal framework of the condominium is a kind of hybrid property; without denying \n\nthe classic solution of division, it allows the integration of separate and independent \n\nfractions with the functional unit of the entire building in a symbiotic way. Its legitimacy \n\nwas based on its ability to reflect the facts of a complex reality, and to shape the need of \n\nproperty, use and maintenance of the good through an equally complex model of overlap \n\nof the two property regimes. \n\n It seems to us that the great innovation was the starting point for the analysis: firstly, \n\nthe functional unit of the building was taken into account through an identification of the \n\nstructural elements ensuring safety and operation, and only after this task had been carried \n\nout was the space division considered, which enabled goods that are under a regime of \n\ncommon ownership to exist within the private spaces. It was through this internal \n\ndifferentiation that defining and delimiting different responsibilities, duties and equitable \n\ncontributions to the maintenance and prosecution of common interests were possible. \n\nThis overlap and coordination of the operations of division allowed symbiotically what \n\nwas once a theoretical impossibility. \n\nThe inadequacy of sovereignty to reflect the real situation in the world is apparent in \n\nits inability to reflect the intrinsic factual features of the Earth System as a whole, treating \n\ndifferent realities equally. \n\n If we adapt scales and perform the same operation on the common home of humanity, \n\nthe planet Earth, we find an almost perfect similarity regarding the type of \n\ninterdependencies established by relations between neighbours who inhabit a materially \n\nindivisible building with a functional unit. \n\n\n\n 132 \n\nThe growing disjunction between the functional domain of biogeophysical \n\ninterconnections and the territorial scope of sovereignty has transformed the classic \n\nWestphalian approach into an ecological nonsense.2 The necessary evolution for the \n\nconcept of sovereignty lies in its ability to integrate the reality of the existence of a \n\nborderless global common that is not limited to the remaining areas of sovereignty. And \n\nfrom this integration, in turn, must emerge a concept of sovereignty that reflects rather \n\nthan defies environmental reality (Brunn\u00e9e 1998). If it is true that international commons \n\nare threatened due to technological progress and increased resource competition, and to \n\nreach the point where \u201cthe international commons must thus evolve to survive\u201d \n\n(Shackelford 2008:104), it is equally true that all sovereignties are also threatened by the \n\n\"global commons\" still being subject to a legal uncertainty and unregulated use, as is the \n\ncase with the Earth System (which includes the climate). \n\nThe solution will inevitably be a legal construction, and therefore the technical choices \n\nfor operationalizing a global response are not different. These choices can result in either \n\na global conflict, as a war of all against all, or the creation of a platform of solidarity, a \n\nforerunner of a globally organized society. \n\n A new organization of global neighbourly relations requires an approach with the \n\nability to reflect the overlap of these two realities. For this, a dualistic approach on a \n\nglobal scale becomes necessary, as it takes into account not only the existing territorial \n\ndivision (where global commons are only the remaining areas of sovereignty) but, in an \n\noverlapped manner, identifies the functional elements responsible for the state of the \n\nEarth System. \n\nAccordingly, the corresponding bio-geochemistry structure of the favourable state of \n\nthe Holocene period should be identified as the most important common resource, which \n\nshould be the subject of a legal definition and be covered by a legal system regulating its \n\nuse. \n\nThe Earth condominium would then be the legal representation of a reality in which \n\nthere is a clear overlap and mix between the tangible and intangible dimensions of the \n\nEarth System. Legally it would be a juxtaposition between the tangible territorial areas of \n\nthe Earth System under the sovereign jurisdiction of states, and the entire intangible \n\nstructure that moves through the atmospheric and oceanic circulation and biogeochemical \n\ncycles that, together, determine the movement of energy and materials through the Earth \n\nSystem, and on which it is impossible to carry out any type of ownership or legal \n\nabstraction for division, and therefore is truly a common good. \n\n\n\n 133 \n\nLacking a physical existence but globally dispersed, the intangible elements of the \n\nEarth System are, albeit on a temporary basis due to their permanent movement, within \n\nthe sovereign space and should be under the regime of an intangible natural common \n\nheritage of all humankind / or World Heritage. \n\n In this juxtaposition between space sovereign jurisdiction and the common system \n\nshould be a model in which the common intangible natural heritage/World Heritage \n\nrepresents the functional unit of the Earth System that blends into the airspace and ocean \n\nspaces of sovereignty but, by referring to a particular favourable structure of \n\nbiogeochemical elements, a different plan of sovereign powers arises, and may be \n\nsummarized as follows. \n\n \n\nPlanet: \n \n\na) Spatial division \u2013 Territorial division between autonomous sovereignty and its \n\ndelimitation in regard to all the remaining parts of sovereign jurisdictions (high \n\nsea, seabed, Antarctica). This is the type of classic territorial division in relation \n\nto the physical planet of 510 million km2, resulting from the existing geopolitical \n\nmap. This operation of dividing the res corporales includes also all airspace of \n\nthe sovereign States, the water column of the territorial seas and exclusive \n\neconomic zones. \n\nb) Functional division \u2013 Refers to the distinction between tangible components of the \n\nEarth System (res corporales), where the territorial division between States is \n\nperformed, and the intangible higher level (res incorporales) of the Earth System, \n\nwhich refers to the elements that compose the biogeochemical structure of the \n\nsystem, both working synergistically to keep the system in well-defined states. \n\nThe higher level is an emerging phenomenon resulting from the interaction and \n\nintegration of the geophysical properties of the planet with the living biosphere, \n\nwhich forms the intangible Earth System. It is a single global system incapable of \n\nany legal abstraction of division, simultaneously inside and outside of all States, \n\nand therefore it is common to all humanity. \n\n \n\nWithin each state there exist ecological infrastructures of the living biosphere and \n\ngeophysical elements, which, through the Earth's history, were (and still are) the source \n\n\n\n 134 \n\nof the favourable state of the higher level. In this regard, ecosystems that are located \n\nwithin the jurisdiction of states provide global ecological services that are functionally \n\ncommon because they are dispersed globally. \n\nConsequently, the benefits provided by ecological infrastructures inside sovereign \n\nterritories that contribute to the maintenance of this ecological safety space of humanity \n\nare ecological services of global common interest. That is, as a result of the overlap of \n\nthe common intangible heritage and territorial sovereign spaces on a global scale, it would \n\nbe possible to include in the intangible heritage the benefits that ecosystems perform in \n\nthe state of the common system. \n\nIt is in this overlap between the intangible elements of the Earth System and the \n\nsovereign rights exercised on the territories where the sources that contribute to the \n\nmaintenance of the living space are located, as well as the human infrastructures that use \n\nthis living space, that will definitively mark the character of this global res communis, \n\nwhich mixes sovereign territories with a common system, with benefits and damage that \n\nare shared globally. \n\nIn this context of interdependence between the interests of all humankind and state \n\ninterests, the proclaimed necessary evolutions of the concepts of CHM, CCH, World \n\nHeritage global commons, sovereignty and international law will only be viable if they \n\ncarried out in a theoretical context that recognizes, reconciles and synthesizes through a \n\nres communis the representation of this overlap of interests and the respective legal \n\nregimes. \n\nAmong the existing models, the only model able to describe this integration and \n\noverlap of two possible different legal regimes is the condominium. With the already \n\nproposed legal separation between the territorial dimension of the planet and the \n\nintangible elements of the Earth System, and through an accounting system to assess the \n\ninputs and withdrawing of the common intangible heritage, it\u2019s possible to bring \n\necological reality and sovereignty rights closer together, building a global condominium \n\nwhere the common interests of humankind are organized in symbiosis with state interests. \n\nThe application of this model on a global scale results in the recognition that the \n\ninternational society is neither a community nor an arithmetic sum of sovereignties. It is \n\nsomething complex that should elevate the law to the art of reconciling the extremes, of \n\nmaking symbiotically dependent what was apparently incompatible. \n\nAccordingly, we can say that the functional unit could be ensured through the internal \n\ndifferentiation of legal regimes between the res corporales and the res incorporales of \n\n\n\n 135 \n\nthe Earth System. However, despite a globally organized society having dealt with \n\nethical, philosophical and legal arguments, and whose cooperation today is already \n\nextended to scientific knowledge, to be more than an idea, it will have to be \n\ninstitutionalized and an accounting system found that matches the internal unity of the \n\nsystem to an internal equity of human relations established through the common use of \n\nthe Earth System. \n\n \n\n5.6. Symbiotic Sovereignty \n\nThe concept of sovereignty has its origins in a matrix incompatibility with the unity \n\nand interactive character of the Earth System. After discovering the conceptual \n\ndisintegration of sovereignty regarding where the concept is applied, old paradigms were \n\ntransformed into paradoxical uncertainties. Its existence is exercised in a contra-natura \n\ntension, ranging from the reaffirmation of political authority and the dilemma of the \n\neffective impossibility of sovereignty being free of the ecological interdependencies that \n\ndrive all states to almost the same level of interdependence, regardless of their \n\ntechnological or economic development. The language of mutual and binding \n\ninterdependencies is hardly explained by international law. When a reality does not fit \n\ninto our abstractions, the solution is often the simple nomination of the impossibility of \n\nunderstanding the problem. This strategy has a double purpose: it not only serves as the \n\nway of explaining the inexplicable but also serves to create the illusion that the \n\ndesignation of the \"complex\" is a synonym of its clarification. \n\nConstructing legal abstractions (boundaries) in the lower level of integration of the \n\nEarth System can lead one to believe that those mental abstractions are reality itself. \n\nAlthough we see clouds, rivers and ocean currents crossing all borders, the lack of \n\nknowledge about Earth System functioning, with all its interconnections and emerging \n\nphenomena (which give it a characteristic of indivisible unity), was a key factor in the \n\nconstruction of this process of mental divisibility. \n\nThe confusion between social abstractions and the systemic reality of the planet soon \n\nmade evident how difficult and serious the consequences of failing to harmonise social \n\nrepresentations with natural reality are. Making non-existent, for practical matters, all \n\nreality that does not fit in the divisions that organize our perception of the world created \n\na structural difficulty in clearly explaining the contradictions, paradoxes, dilemmas, \n\ninterdependencies and improbabilities that are the origin of life. \n\n\n\n 136 \n\nThese are strange and difficult realities not only for law to clarify in all of their \n\ndimensions but also for natural sciences, which had to find new words and concepts for \n\nthe apparent intrinsic contradictions of relationships that apparently revealed opposites or \n\nthe opportunistic. These relationships of mutual benefit and dependence were called \n\nsymbiotic. In some cases, these relationships of interdependency imply such an intimate \n\ninterrelation among the organisms involved that it becomes mandatory, meaning that both \n\nsymbionts entirely depend on each other for survival. Non-acceptance and non-\n\nharmonisation of these dependencies correspond to mutual self-destruction. \n\nIn fact, the main feature of the interdependence is the inability to pursue any of the \n\ninterests in conflict without simultaneously pursuing, or at least serving partially, the \n\napparently opposite interest. Paradoxically, the consequence of the failure of \n\ncoordination is the deepening of the dependence. The global ecological relationships are \n\nobligate, meaning that the inter-relationship between individual and collective interests \n\non any scale, even the global scale, are profoundly intimate and become materially \n\nmandatory; that is, it becomes a non-derogable interdependence and humanly \n\nunavailable. When this \"law of nature\" does not match a socially structured organization, \n\nit becomes a real political impossibility. At the level of interstate relations, this \n\nphenomenon manifests itself through the \u201csovereignty paradox\u201d (Kaul 2013:27), which \n\ndemonstrates that states lose sovereignty through non-cooperation. \n\nIn this field of contradictions and complexities, it is essential to analyse the different \n\nelements of sovereignty and their interrelationships. Considering that territory is a crucial \n\nanchor for global or local analysis (Albert 2007), we also need to understand that this is \n\nnot its only dimension. We need to ask: \n\na) Which elements of this collective identity lead to the perspective of sacred \n\n(absolute) sovereignty? \n\nb) To what extent does this absolute, almost sacred character that underlies the pursuit \n\nof individual interests of the state to the detriment of global collective interest, actually \n\ndepend on the present and future interest of humankind as a whole? \n\n \n\nFor Eduardo Louren\u00e7o (1999), each people just is, by conceiving and living itself as \n\ndestiny. Symbolically, it means as if it always existed, carrying with itself a promise of \n\neternal existence. It is this conviction that delivers to each people and culture (both being \n\ninseparable) what we call identity. \n\n\n\n 137 \n\nThis interesting and profound definition completely ignores the territorial dimension \n\nof this identity, and without wishing to diminish its importance, it is certain that some \n\npeople exist without territories, and territories without people. Equally interesting is the \n\nimportance of the temporal dimension in the formation of this \"conviction\" that is \n\ntransformed into identity. The perception of ever having existed and a destiny or promise \n\nof eternal existence put the projection of the past towards an unlimited future into the \n\ncentre of collective sentiment, offering people that which is called identity. \n\nIn this sense, territory is much more than a merely physical connotation. It is a \n\nconsequence of life in society, so that social relations are essentially projected towards a \n\nconcrete territory and unlimited time. It follows from the above that the sacred character \n\nof physical territory of a nation-state comes from the operation in a specific space of this \n\nsymbolic dimension projected towards an eternal future. \n\nIf this symbolic projection of an eternal future is only possible in the context of \n\ninterdependence between all people and the mutual dependence of all people upon a \n\nspecific state of the Earth System, then the possibility of a people\u2019s sovereignty will \n\nrequire the creation of a common intangible living space where all people can develop \n\nthis \u201clong-term\u201d unlimited temporal projection. Without it, no sovereignty would make \n\nsense. \n\nConsequently, there will be two structural requirements for the emergence of any kind \n\nof community: \n\n \n\n\u2022 the need for a locus as the stability element for building a political organization; \n\n\u2022 the need for a temporally unlimited projection of each people in a subjective \n\ndimension. \n\n \n\nTherefore, the subjective dimension of identity includes, in its genesis and substance, \n\nthe conviction of an existential possibility temporally extended to the successive chain of \n\ngenerations yet unborn. So, we can say that the future healthiness of a certain territorial \n\nspace where the social formation is located is included in the preconditions of \n\nsovereignty. The global nature of the \"environmental good\" transforms the scale of the \n\nfuture state territory healthiness into the healthiness of the Earth System. Each social \n\nformation designed in a particular territory is inevitably integrated into the whole human \n\nfamily, current and future, and therefore has a mutual and global interdependence. This \n\nfact transforms the absolute contraposition between autonomous collective interests of \n\n\n\n 138 \n\nhumanity and the individual subjective interests of each state into a new context: the \n\nbenefit of each state lies primarily in the implementation of the common interest or, to \n\nput into a narrower context, at least while the benefit of each state does not jeopardize the \n\ncomplex balance that sustains what we call the common interest. And this relationship \n\nbetween the territorial sovereignty and the healthiness of the global living space is \n\nsymbiotically necessary. \n\n \n\n5.7. From Complex to Symbiotic \n\nAlthough inextricably linked, sovereignty is not in essence only territory. It \n\nsimultaneously contains elements that open sovereignty to the global, to future \n\ngenerations and to the common interest of all humankind. \n\nThe proof of this is that since the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia, the first exception to the \n\nprinciple that in international law there is no autonomous existence beyond state-centred \n\ninternational relations was the common heritage of mankind. \n\nThe primary exception to this principle is the international commons. In these areas, \n\nwhich include the deep international seabed, the Arctic, Antarctica, and outer space, \n\nconcerns over free passage outweighed the great Western powers\u2019 territorial \n\nambitions and Grotius\u2019s mare liberum triumphed. As a result, these regions were \n\ngradually regulated to a greater or lesser extent by the Common Heritage of \n\nMankind (CHM) principle, in which theoretically all of humanity became the \n\nsovereign over the international commons. (Shackelford 2008:2) \n\nThis exception to the principle of territorial division had its origin in a historical \n\ncultural process based on the ethical perception that there is a common heritage of all \n\nhumanity corresponding to the fundamentals of life and to the renewal cycles of nature, \n\nwhich also includes the temporally unlimited projection of each sovereign identity. We \n\ncan state that the CHM has always existed latently on a higher level to the plan put into \n\neffect. That is, the foundations, the initial booster reason has always been broader than \n\nsimply looking for a legal framework for the remaining parts of the territorial divisions. \n\nHowever, because the scientific tools to define and delimit its implementation were \n\nabsent, it was carried out in an amputated form and in an adverse context. But it is not \n\nbecause it is not recognized in its true dimension that it ceased to exist and the \n\ninterdependencies allowed themselves to manifest. \n\n\n\n 139 \n\n Not to recognize and accept these dependencies is to make them paradoxical, complex \n\nand deeper. \n\nHumanity, as an integral component of the Earth System, is immersed in a necessary \n\nsymbiotic relationship with the Earth System. The sovereignty is the human manifestation \n\nof the political organization of peoples exercised within the Earth System. The symbiotic \n\nrelationships include those associations in which one organism lives on another \n\n(ectosymbiosis) and where one partner lives inside the other (endosymbiosis). \n\nThe exercise of a symbiotic relationship requires coordination of actions mutually \n\nbeneficial for the relationship but because they are mandatory, no coordination gives rise \n\nto a mutual destruction. \n\nRegardless of the system of internal self-organization with which humanity regulates, \n\norganizes and coordinates the use and maintenance of the system in which it operates, it \n\nis necessary to find a source of political legitimacy to build this process. It can only be \n\nfound in the existing political organization, within states\u2019 political authority. \n\nThe figure of the 'international' represents sovereignty as inextricably linked to a \n\ngiven territory. Yet 'international relations' must not be understood as the area of \n\npolitics among States, assuming that within States political authority rests on their \n\nsovereignty. Rather, seen from the vantage point of political theory, the figure of \n\ninternational relations is more: it does offer a powerful solution for a central \n\nproblem of the political, namely the problem to provide a place in which political \n\nauthority ultimately rests, yet at the same time it hides the fact that this 'ultimate' \n\nplace is in reality highly contingent. It is in this sense that the figure of international \n\nrelations allows to combine the political system's inside program of producing the \n\nlegitimacy of political authority with the political system's outside program which \n\ninsinuates that this political authority in need of permanent production and \n\nreproduction is fixed against its environment (of other loci of political authority). \n\n(Albert 2007:53) \n\nThis proposed evolution of sovereignty is therefore a natural consequence of an \n\nattempt to achieve the CCH through the deterritorialisation of CHM/World Heritage. \n\nSymbiotic sovereignty is the evolution that recognizes, reconciles and synthesizes the \n\noverlap of the territorial and non-territorial elements of sovereignty that exist \n\nsymbiotically inside of all states in a single overarching governance condominium. \n\n\n\n 140 \n\nIn this sense, the evolution of the theoretical concept of sovereignty turns out to be just \n\na reconstruction because the issues on which it could potentially be considered a retreat \n\nin sovereignty actually had never been in the states\u2019 sovereign jurisdiction, because no \n\nstate alone can address this issues. Sovereignty is transformed without losing its essence. \n\nOn the contrary, only by harmonising the interdependent relationship between all \n\nsovereignties and the Earth System will be possible to perform the non-territorial element \n\nof each sovereignty. We can argue that this common intangible living space is the \n\nsummation of all the unlimited temporal projections of all the sovereignties, in which \n\ntheoretically all humanity became sovereign over the intangible components of the Earth \n\nSystem as the common natural intangible heritage of humankind. \n\nThe absence of the temporally infinite projection confines sovereignty to the territorial \n\nelement. And it would be the emptiness and the absence of any sense. \n\nWe could briefly review some features of symbiotic sovereignty: \n\n \n\n1. Symbiotic sovereignty, as opposed to the absolute sovereignty [which incidentally \n\nhas never been more than an ideal] of Westphalia, integrates a knowledge that absolute \n\nsovereignty did not have about the territory as a \"live\" system of relations flows of energy \n\nand matter (including biologically organized matter). \n\n2. Symbiotic sovereignty does not abolish territorial sovereignty but changes its nature \n\nand its mode of exercise because it includes in its formula the non-territorial element, \n\ntemporally unlimited, common to all states, which will be the legal basis for building an \n\nequivalence platform through the accounting of compensations and penalties. \n\n3. Territorial sovereignty is maintained as part of the symbiotic sovereignty but under \n\ntwo principles of conditioning that should be the subject of a binding international regime: \n\na) territory uses may not harm the global common Earth System software or, through it, \n\ncause damage to the territories of the other symbiotic sovereign states; b) uses of the \n\nterritory may not limit the choices of future generations [intergenerational justice]. \n\n4. Territorial sovereignty, enriched with this restriction of use, is not a minor harm but \n\na good to be stimulated. It corresponds to a demonstration of the classical principle of \n\nsubsidiarity. In this light, the territorial sovereignty must be understood as the best way \n\nfor humanity to be able to inhabit the planet sustainably, making it a co-sovereignty. Only \n\nthrough many sovereign \"properties\" (and not a mega-state that would eventually be \n\ntotalitarian) can we care for the Earth, moving from a predatory relation to a synergistic \n\nrelationship. \n\n\n\n 141 \n\n5. In fact, only in the context of this new territorial sovereignty, symbiotically \n\ntransformed, will be possible to find a basis in law for the construction of a system of \n\ncompensations and penalties, which is an incentive for states to produce positive \n\nexternalities (receiving rewards) and reduce the negative externalities (avoiding fines). \n\n6. The institutional problem of public international law and constitutional law that \n\nremains open is that of conferring to the United Nations not a part of world government \n\nbut a political, legal, scientific and financial status to allow it to be it the entity that \n\ncoordinates and administers this compensation system, that sets and installs policies that \n\nstimulate the correction and redefinition of the self-regulatory mechanisms. \n\n \n\n5.8. Earth System Stewardship \n\n \n\nThe structural evolution of the recognition by international law of this legal global \n\nobject would have cascading consequences, of which for the moment we highlight only \n\ntwo: \n\n \n\n1) The common interest of all present and future humanity (which is coincident with \n\nthe trans-temporal dimension of sovereignty) would exist via their representation in a \n\ncommon natural intangible heritage; \n\n 2) From the moment the intangible Earth System belongs to someone (in this case it \n\nbelongs to all humankind as a res communis omnium), its use should be governed as a \n\ntrust by a specific law. \n\n \n\nIn other words, it would be possible to discern one of the possible objects of the so-\n\ncalled global governance. The use of the word governance assumes that the object of the \n\nact of managing/governing is identified and defined. This definition can either have a \n\nterritorial or a functional scope. In the absence of a defined object and a clear separation \n\nof powers among the matters that must necessarily be governed globally and the \n\narticulation/coordination with traditional powers of states, we need to admit the \n\nunavoidable emergence of modalities of uncoordinated and unregulated use and the \n\nimpossibility of collective action. \n\nTaking into account the relationship between appropriable sources and inappropriable \n\nresources dispersed globally, and the fact of the living space being an emerging result \n\n\n\n 142 \n\nfrom the integration of the geophysical properties of the planet with the living biosphere, \n\nwe can state that the intangible favourable state of the Earth System is a space of \n\nbiogeochemical flows, whose maintenance of a certain structure of concentrations within \n\nthe limits corresponding to the stability period of the Holocene is vital for humanity. \n\nRecognizing this safe space for humanity as a common natural intangible heritage of \n\nhumankind would allow capturing and accounting intangible flows (positive or negative \n\nfor the state of the common heritage) that all human actors emit in different amounts. \n\nAccording to Carl Folke (2011:8), \u201cA significant part of this challenge is to make the \n\nwork of the biosphere visible in society, in human actions and in financial and economic \n\ntransactions\u201d. \n\nSince most of the benefits provided by sources (ecosystems) are legally nonexistent \n\ndue to their global dispersion, only a comprehensive legal support can give visibility to \n\nthese positive flows. That is, due to the fact of these benefits being global, in order to stop \n\nthem being \"externalities\" for the economy and instead become visible to society, it is \n\nnecessary to first recognize their legal existence; only then may they be subject to \n\nvaluation. Since all people on a global scale enjoy these benefits, and many of them are \n\nprovided by sources (ecosystems) located in territories under sovereign jurisdiction, the \n\nstate in which the source of positive flows is located should be financially compensated. \n\nA structural condition for reaching the civilized journey from explorers and exploiters \n\nto guardians and managers is that the benefits achieved from the state of the Earth System \n\ndo not constitute losses for the societies that perform them. According to the primitive \n\naccounting economic methods still prevailing, the value of a forest only enters into the \n\nGDP and becomes visible in the financial and economic transactions of society the day \n\nthat forest is destroyed and turned into \u201craw material\u201d. \n\nChanging this formula and assigning an economic / financial value to the ecosystem \n\nservice requires a legal solution that recognizes the social existence (legal) of the benefit. \n\nOnly non-territorial legal support can uphold global benefits, and, as a consequence, \n\nfinancial and economic visibility may be possible. The economy cannot consider as a \n\ncredit a benefit that legally does not exist. \n\nIt is no longer about simply controlling polluting emissions; it is necessary to build an \n\neconomy that is able to recover the natural capital that has been destroyed and create a \n\npermanent system of sources renewal that assures the maintenance of the common \n\nintangible space within the limits that humanity should not surpass. This system can only \n\nbe achieved on the scale required if the maintenance and reconstruction of the sources do \n\n\n\n 143 \n\nnot constitute a cost or loss to the state exercising sovereignty over the territory where \n\nthat source is mainly located. Without an international ecological accounting system, \n\nwhere individual contributions and obligations towards the maintenance of the intangible \n\ncommon heritage are clearly defined, there will be no recovery and preservation. No one \n\nwould undertake such tasks when the cost of doing so is private but the benefits collective. \n\nThe shift from an economy of exploration of resources and sources to an economy of \n\nproduction of common resources implies not only the existence of a common intangible \n\nheritage on a global scale but also an accounting system of global biogeochemical flows \n\nin a wider system of international compensation. \n\nThe introduction of benefits in the system of accountancy of ecological flows could \n\nhave a trigger effect in the sense that for the first time the production of common benefits \n\ncould have some individual (state) compensation. \n\nWhen communities, regardless of their size, share the use of the same vital goods, they \n\nare faced with the need to create a system of shared management. As such, it is essential \n\nto compare the different benefits and the consumption by each of that common resource. \n\nThe common heritage is this intangible space, where accountability should be kept by an \n\ninternational institution (UN) with functions of coordination; that is, if we have a system \n\nof compensation between the different performances of each state on the state of the Earth \n\nSystem, each state will try to have the best balance (difference between positive and \n\nnegative inputs) mainly through self-regulation. To achieve that goal, , the condominium \n\ngovernance model, as a universal model optimized to manage global flows in a system of \n\ninternational compensation, should be guided by the following principles: \n\n \n\nNo Winners, No Losers Principle \n\nIn a condominium governance model, the one who deserves to receive compensation \n\nfor the benefits provided to the common heritage is not profiting from it. It is just being \n\nreimbursed for the improvements in the common good enjoyed by everyone. Those who \n\ncontribute to that compensation (through the condominium bodies) are ensuring the \n\nhealthiness of their own territory and protecting the core element of a temporally \n\nunlimited projection of their own sovereignty. We live in a symbiotic mandatory \n\ncondition where we are all either winners or losers. \n\n\n\n 144 \n\nCommon Intangible Living Space \n\nWe could not protect the emergence of a favourable state but we could protect the \n\nbiogeophysical conditions that assure the maintenance of the favourable state of the Earth \n\nSystem. \n\nThe remaining ecological space, scientifically represented by the safe operating space \n\nfor humankind of planetary boundaries, which coincides with the living space of the CCH \n\nconcept and also with the non-territorial dimension of the CHM, is the fine-tuned version \n\nof the res communis well-defined favourable state of the Earth System in light of \n\ncontemporary developments. \n\n \n\nGlobal Condominium \n\nGlobal neighbourhood relations are not relationships of power and domination but \n\nones resulting from the use of the same indivisible resources. In the Earth condominium, \n\nall humanity, present and future, becomes co-sovereign over a well-defined favourable \n\nstate of the Earth System: it is a non-spatial CHM. The condominium is the only type of \n\nres communis with the ability to represent the overlap of autonomous sovereignties over \n\na global common good; it is not restricted to the traditional global commons but spans \n\nacross areas subject to national jurisdiction. In a condominium model, the existence of (i) \n\nan equity criteria to ensure the fair contributions of each co-sovereign and (ii) an \n\ninstitutional arrangement with coordination functions for maintaining the functionality of \n\nthe common home of humanity are necessary. \n\n \n\nSources and Resources \n\nThe favourable conditions of the Holocene arose in an evolutionary fashion throughout \n\nEarth's history and it is through this evolutionary process involving the living part of the \n\nplanet as well as the geophysical hardware that, for example, the relative concentrations \n\nof gases remain relatively constant throughout time. In essence, it is the integration of the \n\ngeophysical properties of the planet with the living biosphere that forms the intangible \n\nEarth System. Thereby the source of this favourable state is appropriable (the ecological \n\n\n\n 145 \n\ninfrastructures are under the territorial jurisdiction of states) and the resource (the \n\nfavourable state) is inappropriable; that is, the resource disperses all over the planet and \n\nits appropriation is physically impossible, as is also any legal abstraction of division. \n\n \n\nOccupation of the Common Intangible Living Space \n\nThe over-use of the favourable state of the Earth System, although not corresponding \n\nto a physical appropriation, can lead to the exhaustion of the intangible living space. With \n\nclimate change comes the discovery that a stable climate is not an inexhaustible factor, \n\nthat is, the incorporeal biogeophysical conditions that determine the state of the Earth \n\nSystem have upper and lower limits and, therefore, are exhaustible. The occupation of \n\nthis resource is not realized through a physical appropriation but rather through a change \n\nin the qualitative state of the incorporeal characteristics of the Earth System. This \n\noccupation of the remaining living space is the result of a chemical change in the \n\nqualitative state of the intangible space, and affects its common use. \n\n \n\na) Enlargement of the Common Intangible Living Space \n\nThe ecosystem services of global common interest are all the biogeophysical processes \n\nperformed by the ecosystems that contribute to the regulation of the stability of the Earth \n\nSystem within the safe operating space. These services, although they originated in \n\necosystems located in territories under the jurisdiction of sovereignty states, are spread \n\ndiffusely in the Earth System and enlarge the remaining living space where all nations \n\nand citizens of the world operate. \n\n \n\nb)  Credits over the Common Intangible Heritage \n\nThe contribution of ecosystem services of global interest to the maintenance of the \n\nfavourable state of the Earth System should generate credit on behalf of the state that \n\nexercises the sovereignty or sovereign rights over the source of this benefit, that is, the \n\necosystem infrastructure that provided those ecosystem services. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 146 \n\nc) Debits over the Common Intangible Heritage \n\nThe more chemical, biological and physical processes, resulting from human activity, \n\npush the Earth System out of the safe operating space, the \u201cless resource\u201d (considering \n\nthe favourable and stable state of the Earth System as a resource) will be available to all \n\nagents. \n\nBecause these processes contribute to the depreciation of the state of Earth System, \n\nand correspond to an occupation of the intangible living space, they should generate a \n\ndebit on behalf of the state that exercises the sovereignty or sovereign rights over the \n\nplace where this activity occurs. \n\n \n\nd) Standardize to Compare \n\nIt is necessary to build a common standard pattern that represents the positive and \n\nnegative flows of each country on the structure of the Earth System. Conceptually, this \n\nnew metric should be an aggregation of indicators that represents core processes that \n\nregulate the stability and resilience of the Earth System. Only by placing the various \n\nbenefits in a common metric compatible with its consumption, can we express, to their \n\nfull extent, the relations to be harmonised. This new metric should be based on the best \n\navailable scientific knowledge. \n\n \n\ne) Life Intangible Support Unit \u2013 LISU \n\nThe common standard pattern could be named LISU (Living Intangible Space Unit) \n\nand should be an aggregation of PB indicators (\u201ccontrol variables\u201d): stratosphere ozone \n\ndepletion, aerosol loading, climate change, ocean acidification, biogeochemical flows \n\n(e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus), novel entities, biosphere integrity, \"land-system change\" and \n\n\"freshwater use\". \n\n \n\nf) Ecobalance \n\nThe difference between the production of positive biogeochemical flows and the \n\nemission of negative flows of each state and the impact of it on the maintenance of safe \n\noperating space of humanity should be the basic equity criteria of contributions for the \n\nEarth Condominium. The balance between the generation and consumption of LISU\u2019s is \n\n\n\n 147 \n\nthe ecobalance. It allows us to realize the status of the relationship of each state with the \n\ncommon heritage, and a structural condition for confidence building. \n\n \n\ng) Legal Foundations of Contributions and Compensations \n\nThe legal basis of the obligation to contribute to the maintenance of the Earth System\u2019s \n\nstate is the fact that all states use within their sovereign territorial space a good that is \n\nunder a co-sovereignty legal regime. \n\nThe legal foundation of the right to be compensated for having contributed to \n\nmaintaining the intangible living space is that this favourable state of the Earth System is \n\nunder a co-sovereignty legal regime, and is also inside sovereign territorial spaces. All \n\nthe sovereignties will benefit from the enlargement and maintenance of the remaining \n\nliving space. \n\n \n\nh)  Agreed Value for each LISU \n\nUsing all the best available economic information about the cost of environmental \n\ndamage and the benefits of ecosystem services, we must construct monetary value for the \n\nproduction and consumption of each LISU. This value must be sufficient to stimulate the \n\nactivity of producing positive flows for the common system, and not constitute a financial \n\nloss for societies that develop those activities. It will be defined through a convention. \n\n \n\ni)  An Intermediate Space \n\nOnly by building a global system capable of crossing, in a comparable manner, the \n\npositive and negative flows can we build an equivalence platform of fairness and \n\nreciprocity, where all actors can see their interests safeguarded. In the current attempts to \n\norganize the collective use of Earth System, positive flows to a favourable Earth System \n\nare not yet part of the accounts. \n\nIt will be an intermediate space between State parties, where each one could \n\nunderstand the contributions from all the others and define its own performance strategy \n\nin relation to the common heritage, taking into account the prediction of other states\u2019 \n\nbehaviour. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 148 \n\nj) Coordination Functions \n\nWith the definition of a new object of law and governance, a new or a reconverted \n\ninternational organization (UN) should form. It should have the capacity to address the \n\nEarth System as whole, tackle the sort of challenges we are facing, and assure \n\ncoordination tasks. Such functions should consist of receiving and redistributing the \n\ncontributions of each State party and gather the different interests then negotiate and \n\nadopt the necessary resolutions. Failed coordination would result in high costs for all \n\nparties. \n\n \n\nk) The Positive Competition \n\nAll parties, depending on internal policies, might improve their balance relative to the \n\ncommon heritage through the encouragement of environmental efficiency and the \n\npreservation or restoration of ecosystems. \n\n \n\nl)  Ecological Trust Principle \n\nThe concept that best translates the idea of sustainable use of this common \n\nintangible heritage by present generations with preservation for future generations in \n\nmind is the concept of ecological trust. This trust is the juridical figure with the best \n\ncapacity to fit the virtual tri-polar relation established between different generations as an \n\nobject encumbered with the duty to keep within the limits of the favourable state of the \n\nHolocene. The elements of trust are: \n\n\u2022 Past generations (Trustors); \n\n\u2022 Present generations (Trustees) \u2013 but we need a governance mechanism here. \n\nFor example, states acting within tight constraints via a revived trusteeship \n\ncouncil; also using own sovereign territory in a way that is consistent with \n\ntrustee obligations/responsibilities; \n\n\u2022 Present and future generations (Beneficiaries) \u2013 current use rights and \n\ninheritors, etc. \n\n \n\n\n\n 149 \n\n5.9. Final Remarks \n\nAs Vandana Shiva (1999) explains, \u201cThe \u2018global\u2019 in the dominant discourse is the \n\npolitical space in which a particular dominant local seeks global control, and frees itself \n\nof local, national and international restraints\u201d. Therefore, Shiva continues, \u201cthe global \n\ndoes not represent the universal human interest; (instead) it represents a particular local \n\nand parochial interest which has been globalised through the scope of its reach\u201d. Although \n\nhumans live in a global political space, they are fundamentally local beings. However, \n\nthey are also creatures who can create a new type of political space which is not global \n\nor local but is a SHARED political space as an intangible locus, where humanity as a \n\nwhole, present and future, harmonise their different contributions to the common good \n\nand ensure the necessity of each sovereignty for the unlimited timescale identity. The \n\nrecognition of one global legal support and an accountability of biogeochemical global \n\nflows in a system of international compensation is a pre-structural-condition for a \n\ndialogue between present living humans and the unborn. \n\n Now we have the access to the central computer of Spaceship Earth, the condominium \n\nit seems to be the conceptual legal framework for the Anthropocene, where we can get \n\ninspired to organize our global neighbourhood. And the ecological neighbourhood is not \n\na relation of power dominance. It\u2019s a relationship of symbiotic interdependence, where \n\nthe military or economic powers are not the only factors on the game. I believe that the \n\ncommon natural intangible heritage of humankind is also the political space of the \n\nSpaceship Earth Condominium, where we can decide how to conduct our own collective \n\naction as neighbours. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 150 \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 6 \n \n\nEarth Global Challenges Prize: A New Shape \nTITLE OF THE ENTRY: CONDOMINIUM: THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE \n\nCOMMON HOME OF HUMANITY \n\nAUTHOR: PAULO MAGALH\u00c3ES IN COLLABORATION WITH ALESSANDRO GALLI, WILL \nSTEFFEN, KATE MEYER, LEENA YENGAR, ALEXANDRA ARAG\u00c3O \n\n \n \n \n6.1. ABSTRACT \n\n \n \n\nPlanetary Condominium: the legal framework for the Common Home of \nHumanity \n \n\nOne of the most crucial challenges of the Anthropocene is to reconcile the rigid \n\ndichotomy between two key diverging approaches for the governance of the Commons: \n\non one side, the classic view of Hardin calling for division and private property rights as \n\nthe only way to avoid the \u201cTragedy of the Commons\u201d; on the other, Ostrom\u2019s suggestion \n\nof coordinated actions for community-based management of common-pool goods and \n\nresources.   \n\nBoth views, at a global scale, have been derived from a society that is territorial, which \n\nconsiders \u201cthe commons\u201d to be that which is leftover from sovereignty or private \n\nproperty. From a legal viewpoint, the Planet has so far been treated as a geographic \n\nterritory divided among States and the remaining territorial global commons. This over \n\nsimplified one-dimensional view leaves out the core expression of nature \u2013 the functional \n\nEarth System as a single, complex life-support system. As such, we argue that the \n\nfavorable Holocene-like state of the Earth System \u2013 i.e., the set of interacting physical, \n\n\n\n 151 \n\nchemical, and biological global-scale cycles and energy fluxes that allow life on the planet \n\n\u2013 is humanity\u2019s ultimate global common that is an intangible and legally indivisible good, \n\nwhich the science of the Planetary Boundaries (PB) framework clearly defines as the \n\n\u201cSafe Operating Space for humankind\u201d.  \n\nThe global and non-territorial nature of this intangible space coupled with the \n\nterritorial nature of sovereignty and private property require the views of Hardin and \n\nOstrom to coexist. \n\nTo achieve this, we propose up-scaling the legal model regulating human interactions \n\nin condominiums to the global level: A condominium is an object with a unitary structure \n\nand common functional systems, which belongs to various co-owners; each co-owner has \n\nprivate or exclusive rights of ownership over determined fractions (e.g. apartments), \n\nwhile sharing ownership over structural elements (e.g., foundation) and functional \n\nsystems (e.g., electricity). This is the only legal model that, using functional and spatial \n\nlegal divisions, allows different legal regimes to coexist within the same physical space.  \n\nWe argue that the functional and spatial divisions found in a condominium are almost \n\nperfectly similar to that of the territorial spaces of the Planet and the functional \n\nindivisibility of the Earth System. Thus, for the functional and spatial divisions to co-\n\nexist in a Planetary Condominium we propose a) recognizing the legal status of the \n\nHolocene-like state of the Earth System as a Common Intangible Natural Heritage of \n\nHumankind, b) using the Condominium framework to solve the overlap between this \n\nheritage and State\u2019s territorial jurisdictions, and c) using Ostrom\u2019s design principles to \n\nensure the maintenance of this Heritage. \n\n \n\nThe key outcomes expected are:  \n\n \n\n1. Autonomous legal object of governance, complementary to sovereignties: the \n\nIntangible Common Heritage of Humankind; \n\n2. Institutional framework with the mandate to govern the management of the Earth \n\nSystem and Global Catastrophic Risks (GCR); \n\n3. Recognition of the intangible global biogeophysical cycles as part of our heritage, \n\nallowing positive and negative global \u201cexternalities\u201d to be accounted, internalized \n\nand managed; \n\n4. New Earth System Accounting Framework based on Planetary Quotas, that can \n\nrepresent all scales, from individual and community, to regional or national; \n\n\n\n 152 \n\n5. Economic compensation scheme based on the balance between negative and \n\npositive \u201cexternalities\u201d and incentives to promote an economy that pro-actively \n\nmaintain the Earth System; \n\n6. System for financing the management/protection of the Commons at the global \n\nlevel; \n\n7. The ultimate recognition and safeguarding of rights of future generations within the \n\ninternational legal system.  \n\n \n\nLike in the Condominium model, the mission of keeping the common systems in a \n\nfunctional state should be institutionalized. We propose the revival of the UN Trusteeship \n\nCouncil (TC) to host this mission \u2013 working under the umbrella of the Security Council \n\nas per the UN Charter \u2013 for four reasons: 1) It is one of the six main UN organs; 2) the \n\nscope of its mandate is global; 3) its revival would not require drafting a new UN Charter; \n\n4) its original mission (administer trust-territories) is analogous to that proposed here, i.e., \n\ntrusteeship of non-territorial global commons (Humanity\u2019s Safe Operating Space). The \n\nrevived \u201cTrusteeship Council for the Earth System and the Global Commons\u201d would be \n\nthe place where local actions get global visibility. TC would become the chief forum for \n\ndealing with GCRs and other trans-national matters.  \n\nIn this new role, half of TC would be composed of representatives from UN member-\n\nstates and the other half by specially qualified members of civil society nominated by \n\neach Member-State. A permanent Scientific Commission, elected by the TC, would guide \n\nthe work of the TC by continuously monitoring State appropriation and preservation of \n\nthe Planetary Boundaries. Its composition would be interdisciplinary with experts \n\nrepresenting PBs, and appointments of Earth Science experts, ecological economists, \n\necological lawyers, and experts in GCRs and social sciences. \n\nThe TC will deliberate on priorities for Global Commons and GCRs, such as: \n\nstrategies for the proactive management of each PB using systems of penalties and \n\ncompensations; rentals for using global commons; and, transaction fees to finance the \n\nmanagement of the Commons.  \n\n \n\nThe initiatives first actions would be the conceptual breakthrough of recognizing \n\nglobal commons spanning across multiple national jurisdictions, as a single legal object. \n\nBy capturing the most important bio-geophysical cycles in the new intangible legal \n\n\n\n 153 \n\nobject, it would be possible to integrate Earth System dynamics within economics to \n\ncreate the ideal economy where the provision of positive bio-geophysical processes is \n\nsynonymous with economic benefits.  \n\nThe Planetary Condominium model details spatial, functional, and temporal \n\ndimensions to addressing humanity\u2019s defining challenge: to maintain a favorable state of \n\nthe Earth System for the continued success of humankind on this Planet.  \n\n \n\nThe proposed model integrates and builds on several mechanisms that already exist, \n\nto make tangible, the intangible concept of the Common Heritage of Mankind. This will \n\nrepresent a significant evolution on humankind\u2019s civilization journey, from explorers and \n\nexploiters, to guardians and managers of our Common Home. \n\n \n \n \n \n\n6.2. MODEL DESCRIPTION \n\n \n \n\n6.2.1. The Planetary Condominium model: the conceptual framework \n\nfor a new global governance. \n\n \nThe Earth System is a single and deeply interconnected whole and needs to be \n\nrepresented for its multi-dimensional qualities. Climate change, biodiversity loss, water \n\nshortage, food security, pandemic diseases, and many other large-scale problems are, \n\ndirectly or indirectly, the consequence of the lack of a comprehensive and interactively \n\norganized governance system. As Kul Gautam (2016:263) best explains it, \u201cOur \n\nunderstanding of the Earth System today is vastly ahead of our organizational capacity to \n\n[\u2026] manage it\u201d and thus \u201cwe need to make a quantum jump to a whole new mode of \n\nmanaging the Earth System\u201d.  \n\nThe favorable Holocene-like state of the Earth System - today identifiable through the \n\nPlanetary Boundaries (PBs) framework, (Steffen et al. 2015; Rockstr\u00f6m et al. 2009)  - is \n\na global intangible good, which is impossible to legally divide and privatize. This \u201clegal \n\nindivisibility\u201d has become one of the most daunting challenges for a globalized society \n\n\n\n 154 \n\nthat regards the management of common goods as something that inevitably results in a \n\n\"tragedy of the Commons\" (Hardin 1968), and which considers the regime of division, \n\nprivate property rights and markets mechanisms as the sole way to solve this inevitable \n\ntragedy. According to Hardin, if placed in a regime of free access to common goods and \n\nresources, each individual will act independently in the pursuit of self-interest, motivated \n\nby the goal of maximizing individual benefits, despite the fact that the collective result of \n\nsuch individual action is the sub-optimal use of resources and overexploitation of the \n\ncommons that inturn impact everyone. This dominant underlying reasoning continues to \n\nmisrepresent the concept of the commons as an open-access regime, operating in a free-\n\nfor-all scenario where there are no boundaries to the usage of a common, no tools for \n\nmonitoring such use or rules for managing it, and no cohesive representation of the \n\ncommunity of users.  \n\nElinor Ostrom (1999) pointed out some basic design principles for successful \n\ncommons\u2019 management, and debunked the established paradigm of fatality: a properly \n\nmanaged common has boundaries, rules, monitoring of usage, punishment of free-riders, \n\nand social norms. Moreover, being a \u201ccommon\u201d, it requires the existence of a community \n\nwilling to act as a steward of its own Common Pool Resources (CPRs).  \n\nA functioning Earth System is indeed humanity\u2019s CPRs: as such, what is at stake is \n\nnot \u201csaving the planet\u201d but rather maintaining the Earth System in that specific state \u2013 the \n\nHolocene-like state \u2013 that is acknowledged to be favorable for humankind to thrive. Our \n\n\u201chome\u201d relies on favorable, life-supporting intangible conditions and therefore a planet \n\noutside such favorable state cannot serve as our \"Common Home\u201d.  \n\nAs humans, we live simultaneously in two different types of communities of interests: \n\none at the level of national societies and the other at the global community level. But \n\nunlike the national communities organized in territories, the global community of \n\nhumanity, is something that, having no personality, appears non-existent and therefore, \n\ncannot be titled with any definitive rights or representation. \n\nThe \u201cterritory\u201d of humanity is the planet, and this fact goes beyond the nation-state \n\nbased governance. Humanity hasn\u2019t yet a locus from which it can base an organized \n\nglobal stewardship community. \n\nOne of the main results of this incapacity is the basis of another fundamental question \n\nof regulation and collective control: \u201cHow can a good that belongs to no one be subject \n\nto a legal regime?\u201d (Kiss 1982:122). In other words, is it possible to regulate the use of a \n\nfunctioning Holocene-like state of the Earth System if this belongs to no one and doesn\u2019t \n\n\n\n 155 \n\nhave any legal recognition within human societies? How can we manage and protect \n\nsomething that is intangible, global and not legally defined?  \n\nUntil now, the legal non-existence of the intangible functional structure of the Earth \n\nSystem has resulted in a model of social organization in which planetary biogeophysical \n\nprocesses are \"invisible\" to the economic processes; they are considered \u201cexternalities\u201d \n\nto our societal organization, despite being key vital factors for humankind. \n\nThe biogeophysical structure of the Earth System throughout the Holocene epoch \u2013 \n\ni.e., the set of interacting physical, chemical, and biological global-scale cycles and \n\nenergy fluxes that provide the conditions for humans to thrive on the planet (Oldfield, F. \n\n&amp; Steffen 2004), belongs intuitively to all humanity in common. This means that such an \n\nEarth System structure cannot be owned, enclosed or appropriated by any State or entity. \n\n\u201cAs a commons it can be used, but not owned, either as private or common property or \n\nvia the claim of sovereign rights\u201d (Taylor 2016:117). These characteristics of belonging \n\nto all but being owned by none do not necessarily prevent the Holocene-like state of the \n\nEarth System from being used in an organized and regulated way and passed on, unaltered \n\nor enhanced, to future generations. \n\nThe transmission of a value is the main purpose of the concept of heritage. The \n\nprinciple of intergenerational equity and the existence of the \u2018right\u2019 of future generations \n\nto receive and enjoy a functioning global ecological space confer an inheritable dimension \n\nto the favorable state of the Earth System. As it belongs to all humankind - present and \n\nfuture generations - as a common heritage, it should be governed in accordance with some \n\nbasic design principles of successful commons management, along the lines of the \n\ninnovative theories of Ostrom(1999).  \n\nHowever, the technical obstacle preventing the recognition of the favourable state of \n\nthe Earth System as a heritage - and thus the construction of an adequate management \n\nsystem - is the fact that this \u201cintangible natural good\u201d cannot be defined by the traditional \n\nunderstanding of the term \u201cglobal commons\u201d, as it seamlessly overlaps with man-made \n\njurisdictional boundaries \u2013 the geopolitical boundaries of nation states. This is a novel \n\nsituation for the current model of international law, which is unable to interpret and \n\nreconcile the intangible functional system of the planet with the tangible sovereignty of \n\nstates. \n\nFortunately, the problem of reconciling seemingly opposing interests in a situation of \n\nsymbiotic interdependence is not completely new to legal sciences as an example can be \n\nfound in the legal model of a condominium.  This model defines a situation in which an \n\n\n\n 156 \n\nobject with a unitary structure and common functional systems belongs to various co-\n\nowners, where each individual has private or exclusive rights of ownership over \n\ndetermined fractions of the object, while at the same time co-owns the structure and \n\nsystems that constitute the object\u2019s common functional elements.  \n\nOn further analysis of this legal construction surrounding our daily life, we realize that \n\nsuch a model offers boundless possibilities of management while challenging the \n\nconventional paradigms of international law: \n\n \n\n1) Condominiums represent not just a space-based division but also a legal division \n\nbased on structural functions: stability (e.g., foundations), systems of common use \n\n(e.g., water, electricity, elevators) and functional elements (e.g., stairs, roof, some \n\nof the windows). All elements that ensure the habitability and safety of the \n\nbuilding, and on which it is not possible to carry out any legal operation of division \n\nor aproppriation - not even abstract \u2013 are under a legal co-ownership regime.  \n\n2) Within the spaces that are under the legal private property regime, there are \n\nelements and systems that are also under the legal regime of co-ownership (e.g., \n\nsome structural walls, water system). This means that by using different types of \n\nlegal division (functional and spatial) it is possible to ensure the coexistence of \n\ndifferent legal regimes, which are usually incompatible, within the same physical \n\nspace. This is the uniqueness of the condominium model. \n\n3) If we add to this differentiated division a system of equitable contributions from \n\neach co-owner to ensure a permanent management of the common systems and \n\nstructures, it is possible to harmonize the interdependence between the individual \n\nproperty interests and common interests. \n\n4) The existence of these two legal regimes in the same physical space do not \n\ncompete with each other, nor does common property limit the full power of private \n\nproperty; conversely, the existence of a common property, superimposed on \n\nprivate property, has the mandate of solely ensuring the maintenance and long-\n\nterm functionality of the systems and structures that all individual owners depend \n\non.  \n\n \n\nWith a proper adaptation of scales, the legal model of the condominium thus provides \n\nus with a solution for the legal organization of human societies at the scale of the planet. \n\n\n\n 157 \n\nThe legal framework of the Common Home of Humanity is essentially that of a Planetary \n\nCondominium.  \n\nIn such a Planetary Condominium (Magalh\u00e3es,P. 2007, 2016), the tangible \n\ngeographical planet \u2013 on which abstract legal divisions are possible (boundaries) and \n\nwhere territorial sovereign powers are exercised \u2013 is coupled with the intangible Earth \n\nSystem, which constitute the functional structure of the planet, and on which no legal \n\ndivision - real or abstract - can be realized. Such a model would allow recognition, at the \n\nglobal scale, of a set of interdependencies and relations similar to those existing among \n\nneighbors who inhabit the same materially indivisible building, and who have an equal, \n\nvital dependence on the proper functioning of the common functional elements.  \n\nIn such a planetary condominium, the apparent limitation of sovereign powers presents \n\nan opportunity to redefine the meaning and terms of sovereignty, and opens minds to \n\ncreative and innovative means of problem-solving with the inherent understanding that \n\nthe overall long-term functionality of the Earth System needs to be safeguarded.   \n\n \n\n \n\n6.2.2. Realizing the Planetary Condominium model \n\n \n\n2.1) The Earth System as an autonomous legal object of governance. \n\n \n\nWhen Arvid Pardo formulated the Common Heritage of Mankind (CHM) concept in \n\n1967, he realized that the characteristics, principles and objectives of CHM did not fit \n\nwithin the one-dimensional view of the planet as a sole geographic area. Conscious of \n\nthis, he sought to avoid the limitations of the territorial approach by proposing an ocean \n\nspace treaty that \"attempted to show how the common heritage concept could be \n\nimplemented in the marine environment as a whole\"(1975,67). Intuitively, the rationale \n\nof the CHM concept incorporated the idea of interconnectedness and the impossibility for \n\nthe global commons to be solely confined outside national borders, and managed through \n\nsiloed governance models.  \n\nIt is only recently that the understanding and measuring of non-territorial, functional \n\nand intangible \u201cglobal environment as an integrated whole\u201d has been created by the \n\nPlanetary Boundaries (PBs) concept (Steffen et al. 2015; Rockstr\u00f6m et al. 2009) . \n\n\n\n 158 \n\nBased on intrinsic \u201chard-wired\u201d properties, the PBs define a combination of \n\nparameters that together describe the state of the Earth System, thus enabling the \n\nunderstanding of the role of interacting chemical, biological and physical processes in the \n\nmaintenance of a favourable state for humanity (i.e., the Holocene), as well as the role of \n\nhumankind in pushing the System out of its stable, desirable state. \n\nSuch a definition of the favourable state of the Earth System and its qualitative \n\nboundaries is what allow us today to identify the object deserving legal protection \u2013 i.e., \n\nthe Safe Operating Space \u2013 and in making it a new object of law.  \n\nThe recognition of objects of intangible character are not new to legal sciences: the \n\nrecognition of intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO, the good will value of companies \n\nin commercial law or intellectual property rights, are examples of \u201cvalues\u201d that, despite \n\nbeing intangible, received legal recognition and a legal regime to regulate their protection \n\nand use. An analogy in scale between these intangible objects of law and the intangible \n\nEarth System is then crucial to understand and recognize the global and indivisible \n\nfunctionality of the Earth System for our society. By envisioning a Planetary \n\nCondominium, with tangible and intangible parts, we are thus defining a global \n\nautonomous legal good, one that is complementary and can co-exist with the sovereign \n\npowers of States.  \n\nThe intangible favorable state of the Earth System corresponding to the geological \n\nepoch of the Holocene has an outstanding value for humankind. It is the meta-condition \n\nfor all current life on the planet, and therefore should be represented appropriately in law. \n\nAs such, we present the recognition of the maintenance of a Holocene-like state of the \n\nEarth System as a Common Intangible Natural Heritage of Humankind. Such a \n\nconceptual breakthrough is the essential first step for the organization of the global \n\ncommunity that must be followed by the development of a new legal system for our \n\nPlanetary Condominium. \n\n  \n\n2.2) Structure, functioning and mandate of the planetary condominium governance \n\nmodel. \n\n \n\nTo institutionalize this newly defined heritage, the mission of the Planetary \n\nCondominium - to maintain the Earth System in a well-functioning state for the benefit \n\nof all humanity and the future generations - should be tasked to an independent institution, \n\n\n\n 159 \n\nacting on behalf of all nations. The activities of such an institution should be limited to \n\nthe elements that fall under the regime of \u201ccommon heritage\u201d.  \n\nCurrently, the only relevant institution with global membership and legitimacy to host \n\nsuch a mission is the United Nations (Gautam 2016). In order to act upon the whole Earth \n\nSystem rather than its individual components through multiple UN agencies, and taking \n\ninto full consideration the known difficulties in amending the UN Charter (Gautam 2016), \n\nwe propose instead, to revive the UN Trusteeship Council (TC) with a mandate to serve \n\nthe mission of humanity\u2019s Common Heritage.  \n\nIn the early 1990s, the TC was suspended as it had accomplished its mandate of \n\nadministering trust-territories. A first proposal for a revival of \u201cUN Trusteeship of the \n\nGlobal Commons\u201d, advanced in 1994 by the Commission on Global Governance, \n\nhighlighted the need for international trusteeship to be exercised over the management of \n\nthe physical and territorial environment (i.e., the oceans beyond national jurisdiction, \n\nouter space, and the related environment and life-support systems). This proposal was \n\nrejected leaving the TC a dormant body which today exists solely on paper.  \n\nThe increased urgency of major global challenges and the realization of the inadequacy \n\nof current governance systems indicate it is time to start thinking beyond the paradigm of \n\nsovereign nation-states and conventional market mechanisms to broader planetary \n\nconcerns. Building and expanding on the original idea of the Commission on Global \n\nGovernance, we thus propose reviving the TC as a trusteeship for the Earth System and \n\nthe global commons it represents.  \n\nA healthy and stable Earth System is the precursor to all the territorial global \n\ncommons, and a necessity to mitigate all environmental challenges and Global \n\nCatastrophic Risks (GCRs). A revived \u2018Trusteeship Council for the Earth System and the \n\nGlobal Commons\u201d would be the chief forum for dealing with the administration of \n\nexisting environmental treaties and the management of global biogeophysical cycles; it \n\nwould define priorities, compensations, incentives and quotas among all users of the \n\nCommon Heritage.  \n\nThis will require a permanent capacity for the TC to take decisions, with expeditious \n\ndecision-making processes involving assessing, monitoring, supervising, allocating, \n\nawarding and arbitrating. As such, the new TC should function as a true manager of global \n\nbiogeophysical cycles with a remit to regulate and sanction, with the goal of assuring \n\nstable functionality of the system.  \n\n\n\n 160 \n\nThe TC would be supported by a permanent Scientific Commission, to be elected in a \n\nTC meeting. Such a committee would guide the work of the TC by continuously \n\nmonitoring appropriation and preservation of the PBs by country. The composition of the \n\npermanent Scientific Commission would be interdisciplinary with experts representing \n\nPBs, and additional appointments of Earth Science experts, ecological economists, \n\necological lawyers, and experts in GCRs and social sciences. \n\nOur proposal is to put GCRs and Earth System management at the same priority level \n\nas maintaining peace and security \u2013 the founding motives of the UN. GCR management \n\nand mitigation are a question of security, and therefore are a strategic area upon which \n\nthe UN should intervene.  \n\nAlongside the support of the permanent Scientific Commission, the TC shall carry out \n\nits mission in collaboration with, and under the umbrella of, the UN Security Council \n\n(SC) -  \u201cin order to ensure prompt and effective action by the United Nations\u201d (Article \n\n24.1). Such cooperation and complementary functional competences between the TC and \n\nthe SC is already provided for by Article 83.1 of the UN Charter \u201cAll functions of the \n\nUnited Nations relating to strategic areas, including the approval of the terms of the \n\ntrusteeship agreements and of their alteration or amendment shall be exercised by the \n\nSecurity Council\u201d and Article 83.3 \u201cThe Security Council shall, subject to the provisions \n\nof the trusteeship agreements and without prejudice to security considerations, avail itself \n\nof the assistance of the Trusteeship Council to perform those functions of the United \n\nNations under the trusteeship system relating to political, economic, social, and \n\neducational matters in the strategic areas.\u201d  \n\nIn accordance with Article 29, and to complement the role of the TC and the SC, we \n\npropose that the Security Council establish a new organ \u2013 a Global Catastrophic Risks \n\nStaff Committee (GCRSC) \u2013 (similar to the already-existing Military Staff Committee) \u2013 \n\nto advise and assist the SC on all questions related to the implementation of concrete \n\nactions aimed at avoiding or mitigating Global Catastrophic Risks, and special disasters \n\nthat could cause serious impacts in the state of the Earth System or could impact at least \n\n10% of world populations.  \n\nThe GCR Staff Committee shall consist of 11 members chosen between the TC and \n\nSC. It is suggested that the GCRSC composition include 2 representatives from TC , 3 \n\nmembers from the permanent Scientific Commission and the SC to be represented by 6 \n\nMembers to ensure equal representation of world geographies. The GCR Staff \n\n\n\n 161 \n\nCommittee, with the authorization of the SC and after consultation with appropriate \n\nregional agencies, may establish regional sub-committees. \n\nThe legal recognition, through the mechanism of a convention, to protect the favorable \n\nstate of the Earth System as a Common Heritage of Mankind, calls for the development \n\nof a system for its legal interpretation and application. The cornerstone of such a \n\nconvention would be fair and ethical representation and maintenance of the favorable \n\nstate of the Earth System. Such a mechanism, that finds precedence in the United Nations \n\nConvention on the Law of the Seas, would allow for the arbitration of disputed decisions \n\nthrough an autonomous and specialized international Tribunal. \n\n \n\n2.3) Coordination platform for the equitable management of the intangible global \n\ncommons \n\n \n\nThe most effective means to organize global relationships in the context of an \n\ninternational system, where everyone has the power to influence and impact all others, is \n\nthrough a system that aggregates and gives visibility to the different impacts produced by \n\neveryone in all the different scales. Rephrasing Ostrom\u2019s words [8], there is a need to \n\nclearly define who the users of CPRs are, and who have the right to withdraw resource \n\nunits from such CPRs. \n\nThe Common Intangible Heritage will be the platform where the intangible positive \n\nand negative global \u201cexternalities\u201d are captured, internalized, accounted for, and where \n\nthe impacts of each individual, family, business, city, and nation State become visible. \n\nThe proposed global governance mechanism of this intangible heritage will give visibility \n\nto all individual or collective actions and their intangible outcomes, whether positive or \n\nnegative; as such each effort will not disappear into a global legal vacuum, thus \n\nempowering each individual to be a steward of the Planet. \n\nThis will incentivize decentralized decision-making, where tasks are to be allocated at \n\nthe lowest possible level as part of a larger nested polycentric governance system, while \n\nat the same time, providing feedback on the performance. \n\nOnly by clearly accounting for the contributions of each entity will it be possible to \n\ncreate a system of compensation, where equity and the social norm of mutual confidence \n\ncould flourish. Further, by addressing the human use and management of the Earth \n\nSystem, we firmly believe that the proposed governance model could reduce the \n\nenvironmental-related threats to political instability.   \n\n\n\n 162 \n\n \n\n2.4) ESAF: the necessary accounting framework for enabling the implementation of \n\nthe Planetary Condominium   \n\n \n\nThe mechanism for translating the Planetary Condominium\u2019s legal framework into \n\naction for implementation, requires the construction of a transdisciplinary accounting \n\nsystem able to track and manage nation States\u2019 use of the intangible Earth System. To \n\nthis end, we propose the introduction of the \u201cEarth System Accounting Framework\u201d \n\n(ESAF). This requires transposing the PBs to a set of scalable indicators, applicable at \n\nany scale of human activity to assign Planetary Quotas (PQs).  \n\nThe PBs framework summarises the complex interactions of the Earth System \n\nfunctioning in an intelligible way, and highlights the main trends in its state. However, \n\nthe main limitation of PBs is that the trespassing of global thresholds cannot be scaled \n\ndown to the sub-global level (e.g., nation States) nor compared to the specific human \n\nactivities that are causing it. For example, the PB threshold for climate change is the \n\nconcentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, with clear difficulties in then assigning \n\nacceptable CO2 concentrations to each nation State.  \n\nOnce fully developed, the ESAF accounting system would be able to: 1) quantify  the \n\nextent to which socio-economic activities within nation States degrade or enhances the \n\n\u201cintangible favorable space\u201d of the Earth System from a biophysical viewpoint and 2) \n\ndesign an economic compensation scheme for the maintenance of such a favorable Earth \n\nSystem state. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4.1) The Planetary Quotas \n\n \n\nThere are 8 Planetary Quotas: carbon, non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHGs), land, \n\nnitrogen, phosphorus, water, aerosols, and ozone depleting substances (ODPs). The \n\ncomplexity of the Earth System and interrelatedness of the PBs is such that there is no \n\ndirect one-to-one conversion from the PBs to PQs. However, together, the PQs represent \n\nthe same safe-operating-space as the PBs and can be divided or allocated to any scale \n\nfrom individual and community, to city, regional or national scales (Meyer &amp; Newman, \n\nupcoming 2018).  \n\n\n\n 163 \n\nThe basis of the ESAF is that every person has an equal right to our Common Heritage \n\nand thus a right to benefit from an equal share of the life-supporting function of the Earth \n\nSystem. Each nation State will thus be allocated one quota/threshold for each of the 8 PQ, \n\nbased on an equal per capita share. A consumption based environmental accounting \n\nprocedure composed of 8 indicators \u2013 similar in their rationale to Footprint-type of \n\nindicators (Galli 2015) \u2013 will then be used to compare each nation State\u2019s use of the global \n\ncommons against the calculated Quotas. The result will be a balance sheet of Earth \n\nSystem credits and debits for each of the 8 PQs, indicating to what extent each nation \n\nState deviates from the quota. For a climatic change PQ, for instance, a biophysical \n\nthreshold (in terms of tonnes of CO2 emitted per person) could be set, which should not \n\nbe exceeded to maintain warming below 1.5 degrees. A carbon-footprint-type indicator \n\nwould then be used to calculate the actual amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere \n\nby the consumption activities of each nation State\u2019s residents. This would then allow the \n\ncalculation of the deviation (\u00b1 xx%) of the footprint value from the allocated Quota. A \n\nsimilar approach could be deployed for each of the other PQs. \n\nOveruse or underuse of the Earth System functionalities \u2013 in other words trespassing \n\nor staying within each of the Quotas \u2013 will then correspond to a monetary fee that should \n\nbe either paid for or received by countries, depending on whether they contribute to the \n\nmaintenance of or drive perturbations to the Holocene-like state of the Earth System.  \n\nAs explained in section 2.4.2, the monetary valuation of such overuse or underuse will \n\nbe estimated by the permanent Scientific Commission of the Trusteeship Council based \n\non the true ecological costs of overshoot per unit of each environmental currency (eg. \n\n$/kgCO2) and the information provided by Earth System sicentists, taking into account \n\nthe scarcity and availability of each of the core drivers of PBs. Earth System credits will \n\nlikewise be compensated using these same rates, thus making the value of the Earth \n\nSystem an integral component of our global economy.   \n\nIt should finally be noted that, as the Earth System does not trade one environmental \n\nimpact for another \u2013 for example, no amount of safeguarded water would compensate for \n\nexcessive GHGs emission in preventing global warming \u2013 the ESAF does not envision \n\ntrade-offs among Quotas. Rather it is designed to drive human behaviour such that none \n\nof the Quotas are exceeded, and therefore the Planetary Boundaries are adhered to. \n\nWe note that there is much controversy over historic contributions to global warming \n\nand substantial literature on the ethics of different allocation procedures. However, the \n\nESAF differs from previous accounting systems in two fundamental ways. Firstly, the \n\n\n\n 164 \n\nPQs go well beyond the only GHGs emission, and the historic impacts of, for example, \n\nland use, or phosphorous consumption, which have very different global distributions. \n\nSecondly, its accounting principle is consumption-based rather than production-based. \n\nConventional carbon accounting, for instance, assign responsibilities to the producers, \n\nand poorer nations, which often devote their production activities to export, thus \n\nassigning relatively high impacts on the Earth Systems to them, compared to their quality \n\nof life. In the consumption-based accounting system we propose, the embodied impacts \n\nof goods and services will be carried over and associated with those nation States \n\nconsuming them.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4.2) Economic compensation scheme \n\n \n\nIn her book, Ostrom (1990) calls for the need of congruence between appropriation \n\nand provision rules, indicating that any successful management of the commons requires \n\nnot only rules on the commons\u2019 use or appropriation, but also a permanent system of \n\nmaintenance and restoration to ensure their long-term functionality. \n\nAs such, planetary stewardship implies not only the control and penalization of \n\nnegative impacts on the Earth System (e.g., the perturbation of bio-geophysical cycles), \n\nbut also the provision to acknowledge, reward and incentivize the maintenance or \n\nimprovement of the functional infrastructures that generate Earth System services.   \n\nIn the current economic system, economic gains are realized \u2013 directly or indirectly \u2013 \n\nthrough degradation and/or destruction, that is, in the consumption of natural capital. For \n\ninstance, the value of forests, vital for the maintenance of the favourable state of the Earth \n\nSystem for our lives and for future generations, only become visible in the financial and \n\neconomic transactions of society when these forests are destroyed and turned into timber. \n\nAs Carl Folke (2011:8) states: \"A significant part of this challenge is to make the work \n\nof the biosphere visible in society, in human actions and in financial and economic \n\ntransactions\u201d. \n\nWhen the production of positive processes for maintaining the favourable state is \n\nsynonymous with economic loss, there can be no change in our behaviour to reduce the \n\nnegative impacts nor can there be any investment in realizing benefits to the common \n\nHeritage. However, if we recognize the favourable state of the Holocene as a legal \n\nautonomous good, we can capture in this intangible common heritage not only the \n\n\n\n 165 \n\ndamages, but also the benefits that contribute to the maintenance of this favourable state. \n\nBy recognizing and capturing the most vital Earth System services, it becomes possible \n\nto frame the economic processes in the context of global chemical, biological and physical \n\nprocesses that support life and human activities, thus modifying economics to become \n\nconsistent with Earth System dynamics.  \n\nThe possibility of using this intangible common heritage for making the work of the \n\nEarth System visible in society, in human actions and in financial and economic \n\ntransactions implies a deep conceptual and structural shift in our economy, transforming \n\nthe current paradigm of individual benefits and collective costs to one in which individual \n\nbenefits are also gained through collective benefits. In a Planetary Condominium set-up, \n\nin which Common Heritage and State sovereignty co-exist, the pursuit of individual \n\ninterests would become in tune with the interests of all humankind. \n\nFor this to be possible, our proposal is to use the accounting system described above \n\nin section 2.4.1 as the biophysical basis for an economic compensation scheme in which \n\nthe overuse or underuse of the Earth System will correspond to an annual fee to be either \n\npaid for or received by nation States, depending on whether they contribute to the \n\nmaintenance or the perturbation of the Holocene-like state of the Earth System.  \n\nManaging the flow of funds - assigning penalty payments and allocating funds to \n\ncountries with positive Earth System balances - would be a key mandate of the TC carried \n\nout annually. We envision a small proportion of the incoming funds to be used to cover \n\nadministrative expenses of the TC, with the majority of the funds to be used in tackling \n\npriority emergencies, paying back historical inequalities (in reimbursing those negatively \n\naffected by the abuse and/or misuse of the commons) and  to cover payments in the \n\ncompensation scheme to maintain (or enhance) key ecosystems and biomes \u2013 located \n\nunder or outside the jurisdiction of one or more States \u2013 whose services are necessary to \n\nensure the functionality of the Holocene-like state of the Earth System, and to invest in \n\ntransitioning to a sustainable future for all. \n\nWith such a system in place, each nation State shall be given full capacity to define its \n\nown strategy for conserving or restoring its ecosystems, such as investing in technology \n\nefficiency or other alternatives, or changing or reducing its use of the Earth System, with \n\nthe mandatory goal of achieving its own best balance in relation to the Common Heritage.  \n\nThe inclusion of the positive environmental impacts in an accounting system could \n\ntrigger a positive competition for restoring the state of the Earth System. This would \n\nencourage a major paradigm shift, from an economy rewarding natural resources\u2019 \n\n\n\n 166 \n\nextraction to an economy which fosters innovation, and where preservation and \n\nproduction of natural resources and well-functioning ecosystems are economically \n\nrewarded \n\n \n\n6.2.3. Final Remarks:  \n\n \n\nAlthough Earth has a specific physical spatial attribute of 510,000 million hectares,  \n\nwe are all globally connected through impacts that each of us produce on the intangible \n\nbiogeophysical functioning of the Earth System. This non-spatial interconnected Global \n\nCommunity,  has no territory in which it can base a legal existence or a cohesive \n\nrepresentation of its own interests. But attempts have been made to meet this challenge, \n\nand valuable and inspiring examples do exist such as, \n\n- The Antarctica Treaty System of 1959, that is considered by some a de facto \n\ncondominium (Glennon 1991) since it is not a sovereign territory (although \n\nvarious nations claim parts of its territory as their own) and provides voting \n\nauthority for 28 nations to jointly govern the area. In all, 50 countries are part of \n\nthe \u201ccondominium\u201d although some consider it a \u201cquasi-condominium\u201d \n\n(Hemmings 2014).  \n\n- Article 136\u00ba of the Montego Bay Convention (UNCLOS) states, \u201cThe Area  (Sea-\n\nbed) and its resources are the common heritage of mankind\u201d. This Convention \n\nadopted a concept of humanity that transcends the notion of State, transferring its \n\npoint of reference to the peoples, regardless of their legal subordination to a State. \n\nHumanity appears as a transcendent reality to the states and to the present \n\ngenerations. \n\n \n\nSimilar to the findings of Nicholas Stern (2007) for the case of global warming, we \n\nbelieve the cost of maintaining the Holocene-like state of the Earth System \u2013 especially \n\nif shared by the global community \u2013 is likely to be lower than the future cost of today\u2019s \n\ninaction. We believe that the Planetary Condominium model is an opportunity for nation \n\nStates to realise and successfully manage its relationship and use of the Earth System.  \n\n The relationship that the Planetary Condominium model effectively operationalizes is \n\nthe environment (or rather a well-functioning, favorable state of the Earth System) that \n\n\n\n 167 \n\nsupports society, which then builds the economy. Further, this model details spatial, \n\nfunctional, as well as temporal dimensions to addressing humanity\u2019s defining challenge, \n\nwhich is to maintain a favourable state of the Earth System for the continued success of \n\nhumankind on this Planet.  \n\n \n\nBesides the legal conceptual evolution, another uniqueness of the Planetary \n\nCondominium model is the novel accounting system combined with the renewal of \n\nexisting global management structures that lead to a very different set of motivations and \n\nbarriers to sub-national and State involvement. Consumption based accounting in \n\nenvironmental currencies beyond carbon shifts the spread of environmental burdens and \n\nopportunites. Not every environmental currency carries the historic components inherent \n\nto carbon accounting. Thus, the proposed mechanism to operationalize the Planetary \n\nCondominium does not carry the same ethical and political barriers that have been present \n\nin past global action on climate change. \n\n \n\nIn conclusion, the model of activties and operations proposed by this Initiative \n\nconstitutes an integrated evolution of experiences in the international management of \n\nterritories and their extention to the management of a \u201cvirtual territory\u201d whose existance, \n\ndespite being intangible, cannot be overlooked.  \n\nThe approach of the proposed Initiative is more extensive and representative in \n\nparticipation and remit. It integrates and builds on several mechanisms that already exist, \n\nto make tangible, the intangible concept of the Common Heritage of Mankind. This \n\nInitiative puts the Earth System and its stability in the spotlight, attempting to empower \n\nit through a legal mandate, to ascertain the continued existance and prosperity of the \n\nhuman civilization. It puts human relationship to the Earth System on centre stage to \n\ndevise a mechanism of management and maintenance. In being able to do so, the Initiative \n\nhopes to opens new avenues and models of solutions to tackle the urgent and trans-\n\ngenerational global challenges today\u2019s world presents. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 168 \n\n6.3.

Core Values \n\n \n\nThe mission of the proposed initiative is to safeguard the favorable state of the Earth \n\nSystem as a common heritage of humankind across all sectors and societies, irrespective \n\nof geo-political jurisdictions. Such a mission envisions, \n\n\u00f0 the creation of a world in which all countries work together to preserve our \n\nplanet\u2019s Safe Operating Space for humans and all living species. \n\n\u00f0 For societies to be driven by a new economic model that prioritize the \n\npreservation of nature, not its depletion. \n\n\u00f0 the building of an inherent sense of respect and belonging to our Common \n\nHome \u2013 as citizens of planet Earth, enriched by our individual cultural \n\ndiversities.  \n\nTo this end our core values are rooted to ensure scientific rigor and evidence based \n\nactivity and response; assign a universally recognized legal existence to the Safe \n\nOperating Space - the common intangible heritage for all humankind; practice socio-\n\ncultural, economic and political diplomacy; and, create a platform that allows global \n\nrepresentation and fosters universal participation. \n\nThis would define the construction of an operational mechanism for the monitoring \n\nand protection of the Safe Operating Space, that is resilient, allows socio-economic \n\nequity, functions through active dialogues and is transparent, reliable and accountable. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.3.2. Decision-making Capacity \n\n \n\nIn line with the core values, the decision making process will be based on scientific \n\nevidence, with legislative clarity and expedited in a transparent, reliable and accountable \n\nmanner.  \n\nOperationally, decision-making involving assessing, monitoring, supervising, \n\nallocating, awarding and arbitrating is proposed to be undertaken by the revived UN \n\n\n\n 169 \n\nTrusteeship Council for the Earth System and the Global Commons, with a mandate to \n\nregulate and sanction, with the goal of assuring functionality of the governance model.  \n\nFrom the perspective of ensuring robust scientific and technical monitoring and \n\nassessments, the Council\u2019s activity and decision are to be supported by the Permanent \n\nScientific Commission comprised of Planetary Boundaries scientists, Earth System \n\nscientists who study the whole system, ecological economists, ecological lawyers, experts \n\nin Global Catastrophic Risk and social scientists. The main role of the Commission will \n\nbe to provide an overview of global effects. This includes establishing of the connection \n\nbetween scientific information and assigned monetary values, assessments on cultural \n\nacceptance, community rights and responsibilities, among other decision-making \n\nparameters requiring trans-disciplinary input.  The trans-disciplinary composition of the \n\nPermanent Scientific Commission will be mandated to contextualize and frame economic \n\nprocesses in the context of global chemical, biological and physical processes that support \n\nlife and human activities, integrating Earth System dynamics and economics - work that \n\nno market-mechanism is currently able to do. \n\nThe Earth System Accounting Framework (ESAF) and the Planetary Quotas (PQ), \n\ndeveloped by this scientific commission would aim to offer rigorous administrative \n\naccountability and transparency in support of the operational regulation and decision-\n\nmaking processes. Complementary functional competencies and relationship between the \n\nTrusteeship Council and the UN Security Council, stated through Articles 24.1, 83.1 and \n\n83.3 of the UN Charter, lends an important degree of administrative surveillance, and \n\ntherefore further reliability and accountability of decisions and actions.  \n\nFurther, to complement the roles of the Trusteeship Council and the Permanent \n\nScientific Commission, we propose that the Security Council establish a new organ \u2013 a \n\nGlobal Catastrophic Risks Staff Committee (GCRSC) \u2013 (similar to the already-existing \n\nMilitary Staff Committee) \u2013 to advise and assist the Security Council on all situations \n\nrelated to the implementation of concrete actions aimed at avoiding or mitigating Global \n\nCatastrophic Risks and other disasters that could cause serious impacts to the state of the \n\nEarth System or could impact at least 10% of world populations. This would further \n\nbolster prompt action and implementation related decision-making in addressing these \n\nvital cases.   \n\n \n\n      \n\n\n\n 170 \n\n6.3.3. Effectiveness \n\n \n\nFactoring in the sensitivity of the decision-making process and conscious of the fact \n\nthat only structural shifts will lead to systemic effects, this initiative proposes an \n\nincentives-based system for the production of global public goods, rather than being an \n\nexclusive coercive legal system of injunctions, whose legitimacy would always be \n\nquestionable and that no sovereign State will accept.  \n\nIn this sense, the effectiveness of the proposed initiative draws from:  \n\n\u00f0 the communication of its scientific studies and socio-economic \n\nmanagement structure that will demonstrate and actively work towards \n\ndriving the perception that prioritizing an ongoing, resilient and well-\n\nfunctioning Earth System does not result in economic loss.  \n\n\u00f0 The fact that even though PQs cannot be translated directly back to the PBs \n\n(as they are also global limits in different indicators that allow the safe-\n\noperating-space to be divided and operationalized), the PB method would \n\nstill be used to assess the global status of Earth System functioning relative \n\nto a Holocene-like state. The point here is that the true ecological costs of \n\novershoot per unit of each environmental currency (e.g. $/kgCO2) can be \n\ndetermined. In this way, if everyone participated, the system would \n\ngenerate enough money to cover the costs of mitigation/adaptation \u2013 and \n\nthat it would be spent for this purpose. This would remove one of the \n\nbarriers that has prevented some from signing global treaties for limiting \n\ncarbon emissions \u2013 i.e. the idea that the money contributed may be \n\n\u201cmisused\u201d. \n\n\u00f0 the economic element of the ESAF / Planetary Condominium model, that  \n\nproposes a   financing system that will not only favor investments in natural \n\ncapital and the preservation of critical Earth System functions, but also \n\ninvest to fight extreme poverty by making sure that individual basic needs \n\nare met. The accounting system will address inequality between poor and \n\nrich, north and south, as well as rural and urban people. This could also \n\ncontribute towards dealing with the root causes of politically-motivated \n\nunrest and in extreme cases, violence.  \n\n\n\n 171 \n\n\u00f0 its programmatic approach, where we choose to organize management of \n\nthe initiative under the auspices of the United Nations as the sole, truly \n\nglobal and trans-disciplinary institution relevant and respected by all its \n\nmember nations. We propose to channel the work of the initiative through \n\nthe close and complementary relations between the TC and Security \n\nCouncil (SC) already foreseen in UN Charter, and propose the creation of \n\na Global Catastrophic Risks Staff Committee by the SC to ensure the \n\npossibility of prompt and effective action by the United Nations. Thereby, \n\nwe introduce the Earth System management and GCRs at the same level of \n\nimportance as the maintenance of peace and security, which are the \n\nfounding motives of the UN.   \n\nFurther, providing visibility to all individual or collective intangible outcomes for each \n\naction, (positive or negative) would empower each individual to become a steward of the \n\nPlanet. This will incentivize decentralized decision-making where tasks are to be \n\nallocated at the lowest possible level as part of a larger nested polycentric governance \n\nsystem, while at the same time, providing feedback on the efficiency and efficacy of its \n\nperformance. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.3.4. Resources and Financing \n\n \n\nThrough its work over the past 10 years the initiative already supports a robust and \n\ngrowing team of  \n\n\u00f0 Scientific and social science expertise \n\n\u00f0 Advisory board of the initiative in its current state \n\n\u00f0 Researchers and academic personnel \n\n\u00f0 Material resource \n\nIn its current operations of building the core features of the initiative, grants and funds \n\nhave been sourced from Portuguese Governmental authorities and through commercial \n\nconsulting partnership contracts. \n\n\n\n 172 \n\nOn the international scale, operations would be supported through the inflow of \n\npenalty costs and environmental levies that will be charged, once the full penalty, \n\ncompensation and stewardship schemes are in place, implemented and regulated. This is \n\nto be executed under the following mechanism: \n\n\u00f0 Comparing each nation State\u2019s use of the Common Heritage against the \n\ncalculated Quotas. The result will be a balance sheet of Earth System \n\ncredits and debits for each of the 8 PQs, indicating to what extent each \n\nnation State deviates from its quota. Overuse or underuse of the Earth \n\nSystem functionalities \u2013 in other words trespassing or staying within each \n\nof the Quotas \u2013 will then correspond to a monetary fee that should be either \n\npaid for or received by countries, depending on whether they contribute to \n\nthe maintenance or perturbation of the Holocene-like state of the Earth \n\nSystem.  \n\n\u00f0 There are other possibilities for financing the Planetary Condominium, \n\nsuch as the charging of a modest rental or transaction fees that could \n\nmobilize significant funds. These could include charges on: military \n\nspending and arms exports, foreign exchange transactions, international \n\ntrade, airline tickets, maritime freight, ocean fishing, sea-bed mining, \n\nsatellite parking spaces, use of electromagnetic spectrum and the internet. \n\n\u00f0 Knowing that humans have already altered the Holocene-like state of the \n\nEarth System, entered the Anthropocene, transgressed 4 of the 9 PBs, and \n\novershot all footprint metrics related to our planetary resources and sinks, \n\nit is clear that the sum shall begin with costing penalties and \n\ncompensations.  In an ideal world, the success of our initiative will be \n\nmeasured by the reduction of penalties and compensations and a rise in the \n\nstewardship awards, complemented by observations and models suggesting \n\nrestored Earth System stability.  \n\nThe basis of the ESAF is that every person has an equal right to our Common Heritage \n\nand thus a right to benefit from an equal share of the life-supporting function of the Earth \n\nSystem. Through the Economic compensation scheme, fairness and equity could be \n\nachieved in balancing the responsibility between the biggest users of the Earth System \n\nand those that provide common benefits. \n\n\n\n 173 \n\n \n\n \n\n6.3.5.Trust and Insight \n\n \n\nThe functions that enhance trust in the proposed initiative and its mode of operations \n\nare: \n\n\u00f0 the inability of the multiple siloed mechanisms that attempt to answer \n\nglobally pervasive challenges \n\n\u00f0 the fact that the initiative will provide a legal mandate to the representation \n\nof the Earth System in its favorable state in order to represent the interest \n\nof all humankind in the present and future \n\n\u00f0 the multiple-levels of accountability \u2013 the science, the economics, law and \n\ngovernance structure.  \n\n\u00f0 Operating through the universally recognized body for peace and security- \n\nthe United Nations. \n\n\u00f0 Open access to the science, the practice of the legal framework and all the \n\ninformation that constitutes the basis of all decisions in this initiative and \n\nits governance \n\nMost importantly, only by clearly accounting for the contributions of each entity will \n\nit be possible to create a system of compensation, where equity and the social norm of \n\nmutual confidence could flourish. \n\nThe initiative highlights the valuable insight, based on observations in science and in \n\nthe natural disasters in the world we see today, that intangible systems are equally \n\nimportant and worth recognizing and protecting for humankind to thrive. \n\nBringing the basis of human survival and enterprise \u2013 the favorable, stable Earth \n\nSystem- to the forefront is one of the most profound insights of this initiative. This insight \n\nhas no economic worth of its own but when it becomes the core concern of socio-\n\neconomic decisions, it would play a pivotal role in resolving and finding solutions to the \n\nmost complex challenges humankind is faced with today and will face in the future. \n\nThe Law of the High Seas and the Sea Bed conventions that exist to protect their \n\nrespective domains have proven that it is possible to build on the effectiveness that these \n\n\n\n 174 \n\nframeworks of governance have shown to expand the mandate of the Earth System as a \n\nwhole. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.3.6. Flexibility \n\n \n\nThe feedback mechanisms of the initiative\u2019s model, just as the dynamic nature of the \n\nEarth System itself, creates flexibility in incorporating new findings and perspectives into \n\nthe decision-making system.  The initiative has developed its operational model based on \n\nthe three principles that Dietz et al. [22] listed in 2003 stated as being particularly relevant \n\nfor problems at larger scales: \n\n\u00f0 well-structured dialog involving scientists, resource users and interested \n\npublic;   \n\n\u00f0 institutional arrangements must be complex, redundant and nested in many \n\nlayers;  \n\n\u00f0 governance should imply mixtures of institutional types.  \n\n \n\n6.3.7. Protection against the abuse of power \n\n \n\nThe initiative maintains the stability of the favorable Earth System as its core \n\nobjective. The construction of the regulatory mechanisms and the governance systems \n\nare hence focused on this core objective and protected as highlighted below:  \n\n\u00f0 Just as the Earth System does not trade one environmental impact for \n\nanother the ESAF does not allow trade-offs among Quotas. Rather it is \n\ndesigned to drive human behavior such that none of the Quotas are \n\nexceeded, and therefore the Planetary Boundaries are respected. \n\n\u00f0 The initiative proposes to be embedded within the UN, as the only existing \n\ninstitution with the most universal membership and legitimacy, with a \n\nGeneral Assembly where 193 members-States have a seat, with a majority \n\nof democratic procedures in almost all of its organs, with an internal \n\n\n\n 175 \n\nseparation of powers and competences in different organs, of which one is \n\nthe International Court of Justice.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.3.8. Accountability \n\n \n\nThe Common Intangible Heritage will be the platform where the intangible positive \n\nand negative global \u201cexternalities\u201d are captured, internalized, accounted for, and where \n\nthe impacts of each individual, family, business, city, and nation State become visible. \n\nThe initiative has installed an accounting system for its scientific work on Earth System \n\nprotection, its framework of economic activity within the initiative and the governance \n\nstructure as highlighted below: \n\n\u00f0 The Earth System does not trade one environmental impact for another \u2013 \n\nfor example, no amount of safeguarded water would compensate for \n\nexcessive GHGs emission in preventing global warming \u2013 the ESAF will \n\nnot allow trade-offs among Quotas.  \n\n\u00f0 The ESAF system is developed to compare each nation State\u2019s use of the \n\nglobal commons against the calculated Quotas. The result will be a balance \n\nsheet of Earth System credits and debits for each of the 8 PQs, indicating \n\nto what extent each nation State deviate from the quota.  \n\n\u00f0 The monetary valuation of such overuse or underuse will be estimated by \n\nthe permanent Scientific Commission of the Trusteeship Council based on \n\nthe natural capital valuation literature and the information provided by \n\nEarth System scientists, taking into account the scarcity and availability of \n\neach of the core drivers of PBs. Earth System credits will likewise be \n\ncompensated using these same rates, thus making the valuation of the Earth \n\nSystem a transparent process.   \n\n\u00f0 Open access to the databases, scientific material and decision-making \n\ncriteria allow further accountability of the processes. \n\n\u00f0 The multi-layered organization, embedded in the most unbiased of global \n\norganizations- the United Nations - and the trans-disciplinary team that \n\n\n\n 176 \n\nexecutes the governance system of the initiative is able to self-check and \n\nregulate the decision-making process to be relevant, impartial, \n\nrepresentative, fair as well as contestable. \n\n\u00f0 Just as the international Courts have an international tribunal for the law of \n\nthe Sea, the initiative shall work towards the development of an Earth \n\nSystem Convention that is protected by a similar jurisdictional system. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n 177 \n\n \n \n \n\nChapter 7 \n \n\nSOS TREATY \u2013 Safe Operating Space Treaty \nDraft on the \n\nCOVENANT ON THE MANAGEMENT OF EARTH SYSTEM USE. \n\u201cSAFE OPERATING SPACE OF HUMANKIND\u201d \n\nAS A NATURAL INTANGIBLE COMMON HERITAGE OF HUMANKIND \n \n \n \n\n7.1. PREAMBLE \n\n \n \nConsidering that: \n \n\n\u2022 All countries are exposed to environmental impacts, positive and/or negative, \n\nfrom other countries. Given that knowledge of this reality is still recent and the \n\nEarth System continues to be used in a non-regulated manner, humanity has now \n\nreached a point where it is characterized its own life-support system. \n\n \n\n\u2022 The main structural motive at the origin of this unregulated use is the fact that the \n\nEarth System does not exist from a legal perspective, and is therefore being used \n\nas a no-man\u2019s land (res nullius). \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022  The global commons were always (and continue to be) understood as the mere \n\nremaining geographical spaces of political division between states. The ecological \n\ngoods that exist in and outside all sovereignties simultaneously currently find no \n\nlegal autonomous existence within the current legal framework. Humanity, as a \n\nwhole, both in the present and the future, corresponds in the same way to this \n\njuridical inexistence. \n\n \n\n\n\n 178 \n\n \n\n\u2022 The global, diffuse and intangible dimension of a vital good such as a stable \n\nclimate, effects from the damage to which are sustained over several generations, \n\ntransform this traditional approach into an ecological nonsense. Today\u2019s doctrine \n\nrecognizes that international law contains a structural theoretical error in its \n\napproach towards global ecological goods and their intergenerational dimension. \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Recent developments in Earth System science, which define and describe the \n\nEarth System as a whole, provide us with insights into the nature and limits of the \n\nHolocene epoch (the last 11,700 years) \u2013 the only state of the Earth System that \n\nwe know with certainty can support advanced human civilizations. \n\n \n\n\u2022 It is now possible to understand the chemical, biological and physical processes \n\nof the Earth System that are conducive to maintaining a favourable state for \n\nhumanity (i.e., the Holocene) and those that act to push the Earth System out of a \n\nstable, desirable state. \n\n \n\n\u2022 A tipping point is when a system fundamentally changes structure and function, \n\ntips over and settles into a new stable state. And the prerequisite to do so is that a \n\nfeedback mechanism, which keeps the system tightly in one state, changes \n\ndirection. \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 This favourable state, which arose in an evolutionary fashion throughout Earth\u2019s \n\nhistory, is an \u201cintangible natural limited resource\u201d on Earth. In essence, it is the \n\nintegration of the geophysical properties of the planet with the living biosphere \n\nthat forms the intangible Earth System, a single global system incompatible with \n\nany legal abstraction of division. With the shift of the biogeophysical structure, \n\nthe system changes fundamentally from one stable and favourable state to another \n\nstable state. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 179 \n\n\u2022 With the growing understanding of the Earth System and the recent possibility of \n\nmeasuring its state through the definition of planetary boundaries \u2013 (Rockstr\u00f6m \n\net al. 2009; Steffen et al. 2015) \u2013 we now have a scientific basis upon which to \n\ndefine the Safe Operating Space of the Earth System. \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 With the ability to quantify and define the desirable state of the Earth System, \n\nwe\u2019ve made a giant step in order to solve the legal vacuum created by the \n\nindeterminate and vague concepts that have characterized national or international \n\nlegal texts over the last decades. Expressions such as the common concern of \n\nhumankind, the common interest of humankind, the life-support system, \n\nintergenerational solidarity, ecological integrity and sustainability now have a \n\nset of indicators and numbers that encircle and delimitate what is global \n\nsustainability. \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022  This new knowledge can be instrumental in the architecture of new solutions that \n\nallow us to overcome the existing dysfunctionality between ecological reality and \n\nthe current legal constructions. \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Throughout history, newly discovered spaces became objects of legal definition. \n\nThe knowledge of this intangible and non-territorial Safe Operating Space of the \n\nEarth System obliges our social institutions to respond to the most recent scientific \n\nevolutions and build new representations capable of going beyond the reductionist \n\nlegal, physical or biological approach that represents nature merely as a \n\ngeographically delimited space or as a collection of biological species that can \n\nbenefit from legal protection. \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 To achieve this fundamental shift, we need to be capable of representing the Earth \n\nSystem as a whole in international law. To do this in a legal sense, we need to \n\n\n\n 180 \n\nidentify the legal status of the Earth System. \u201cHow can a good that belongs to no \n\none be subject to a legal regime?  (Kiss 1982:122)? \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 In this sense, the first step to structurally organizing this interdependence is to \n\nachieve a clear delimitation of the common good/resource to be protected (both \n\ninside and outside of all sovereignty) and upon which we all depend. Only then \n\nwe have the structural conditions to be possible organize its use in a sustainable \n\nway. \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 To make this evolution real, every benefit and/or damage made to the Earth \n\nSystem can no longer disappear into a \u201clegal black hole\u201d. Economics calls those \n\nbenefits and/or damages \u201cpositive and negative externalities\u201d but they cannot be \n\n\u201cexternal\u201d to our societies. \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 If we are able to identify and measure the core global drivers that define the state \n\nof the Earth System, we have the necessary conditions to start to manage its use. \n\nOnce it is measured, it can be managed and operationalized. \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 In the theory of international public domain, it is possible to attribute certain goods \n\nto interests of the community without changing the rules of jurisdiction, that is, \n\nwithout subtracting these goods from the sovereignty of territorial states or from \n\nthe property of other entities. \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Today\u2019s institutional architecture does not operate as a governance system capable \n\nof addressing global challenges and rising above the fragmentation, segmentation \n\nand incoherence that result in today\u2019s ineffective institutions. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 181 \n\n\u2022 Before undertaking a practical reform, we need a new approach able to close the \n\ngap between the theory that underlies the organization of international institutions \n\nand the reality of Earth System dynamics. \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 If we are able to create a new legal fiction capable of addressing the intangible \n\nquality and the non-territorial dimension of the Earth System state, which has a \n\ndialectical relationship with tangible territories of states but is not confined to any \n\nstate (and therefore cannot be considered a subtraction to a sovereign power of a \n\nstate), we can create a legal object distinguishable from every sovereignty. \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 The actual legal inexistence leads to the absence of a scheme of contributions or \n\nresponsibilities to ensure both the maintenance and necessary improvements for a \n\nwell-functioning Earth System, and leads to the lack of an administrator (or an \n\ninstitution with similar functions) in charge of ensuring its ongoing maintenance \n\nin a sustainable way. \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 A legal model for the Anthropocene requires a regulation responsible for ensuring \n\nthe protection and promotion of common interests through the construction of a \n\nnew way that represents the interests of all humankind, both in the present and the \n\nfuture. \n\n \n \nMindful of the will of the peoples, set out solemnly in the Charter of the United Nations, \n\nto safeguard the values and principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human \n\nRights and all other relevant instruments of international law, \n\n \n\nConcerned by the fate of future generations in the face of the vital challenges of this \n\ncentury,  \n\n \n\nConscious that, at this point in history, the very existence of humankind and its \n\nenvironment are threatened, \n\n\n\n 182 \n\n \n\nRecalling the UNESCO Declaration on the Responsibilities of the Present Generations \n\ntowards Future Generations from 21 October to 12 November 1997, \n\n \n\nBearing in mind that the fate of future generations depends to a great extent on decisions \n\nand actions taken today, and that present-day problems, including poverty, technological \n\nand material underdevelopment, unemployment, exclusion, discrimination and threats to \n\nthe environment must be solved in the interests of both present and future generations, \n\n \n\nConvinced that there is a moral obligation to formulate behavioural guidelines for the \n\npresent generations within a broad, future-oriented perspective, \n\n \n\nTAKING INTO ACCOUNT the need to define and develop the provisions of \n\ninternational instruments in relation to the Earth System use\u2026 have agreed on the \n\nfollowing: \n\n \n \n\n \nGENERAL DISPOSITIONS \n\n \n \n\n \n7.2. PART 1 \u2013 OBJECTIVE \n\n \nARTICLE 1 \n\n \nObjective \n\n \nThis Draft Covenant provides a legal framework with the aim of transforming our \ncommon inhabitation of the planet from a system of exploitation to a system of \nstewardship of the Earth System through a process of self-organization to manage its use. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n 183 \n\n7.3. PART 2 \u2013 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES \n\n \nConscious that the global and deeply interconnected functioning of the Earth System \nrequires new organizational solutions, all parties shall cooperate in a global partnership, \nlooking for new pathways to achieve the objective of this covenant by the following \nfundamental principles: \n\n \n\nARTICLE 2 \n \n\nEarth System \n \nThe Earth System consists of the interacting physical, chemical and biological processes \nthat cycle materials and energy throughout the system at the planetary level. In essence, \nit is the integration of the geophysical properties of the planet with the living biosphere \nthat forms the intangible Earth System, a single global system incapable of any legal \nabstraction of division. A key process of the Earth System is self-regulation, which \nconsists of feedback loops formed by component parts of the system (both inside and \noutside of all sovereignties), which work synergistically to keep the system within well-\ndefined states. \nHumans and our activities are an integral part of the Earth System. \n \n\n \nARTICLE 3 \n\n \nThe Planet and the Earth System \n\n \n \nThroughout the history of planet Earth, on a geological timescale, the Earth System has \nalways existed in a process of permanent transformation. Recent scientific developments \ndefined and described the Earth System as a whole, and provided a well-defined \nbiogeophysical structure of the Holocene epoch, the only state of the Earth System that \nwe know for certain can support advanced human civilizations. \nThe recognition that the planet Earth and the Earth System\u2019s state are two distinct \nconcepts is a structural prerequisite to enable a global legal approach. \n \n \n\nARTICLE 4 \n \n\nThe Qualitative State of the Earth System \n \nThe Earth System is a single and complex system that exists within the boundaries of \nwell-defined states. It\u2019s now possible to understand the chemical, biological and physical \n\n\n\n 184 \n\nprocesses of the Earth System that are conducive to maintaining a favourable state for \nhumanity (i.e., the Holocene) and those that act to push the Earth System out of a stable, \ndesirable state. \n \n \n\nARTICLE 5 \n \n\nPlanetary Boundaries \n \nThe Planetary Boundaries (PB) framework provides a scientific basis upon which it is \npossible to define the features of the Safe Operating Zone for humankind, strongly \noriented towards maintaining a relatively stable state of the Earth System, one that is very \nsimilar to that of the past 12,000 years (Holocene). From a human perspective, PBs are \nbiogeophysical limits that define the state of the Earth System, that exist through the \nidentification of control variables and tipping points from which irreversible abrupt global \nchanges may occur. \n\n \nARTICLE 6 \n\n \nA Limited Resource \n\n \nThe favourable state of the Earth System arose in an evolutionary process involving the \ninteractions between the living biosphere as well as the geophysical part. Given that there \nare human activities that cause chemical, biological and physical alterations that are \nconducive to pushing the Earth System out of this desirable state, we can consider that \nthis \u201cfavourable state\u201d as a vital good exhaustible through its use. In this sense it is \u201can \nintangible natural limited resource\u201d on Earth. \n \n \n\nARTICLE 7 \n \n\nThe Source/Resource Relation \n \nFrom a historical perspective, the favourable state of the Earth System is the result of \ninteractions between the living biosphere and the geophysical properties, that is, in this \nsense the ecological infrastructures of biosphere are sources that contributed and still \ncontribute to maintain this resource. \n \n\n \nARTICLE 8 \n\n \nRemaining Ecological Space on Earth \n\n \nFrom the moment we are aware that this favourable biogeophysical structure of the Earth \nSystem is exhaustible, internal relations are equally reconfigured among all users of that \n\n\n\n 185 \n\nresource. We need rules in order to organize the relations established around the use of \nthe remaining ecological space for human development, which, by being exhaustible, \ncannot be used in a free-access regime. \n \n\nARTICLE 9 \n \n\nLegal Indivisibility \n \nThe Earth System as a single and integrated system cannot be included within any already \nexisting legal convention because it is impossible to divide it conceptually, materially, or \nthrough any legal abstraction. Therefore it must be considered a common resource. \n \n\nARTICLE 10 \n \n\nA Common Intangible Space \n \nOnce the use of this limited vital good is not exclusive to any \u201cuser\u201d and no \u201cuser\u201d can \ndeny access to any other, in global terms we are facing a situation where all people are \nexposed to the acts of others, creating an interdependence of benefits and harms shared \non a global scale. \nIn this sense its use requires organization amongst users that defines privileges and \nresponsibilities. \n \n\n \nARTICLE 11 \n\n \nA Primordial Resource \n\n \nThe exceptional stable conditions of the Holocene period, unique in the history of the \nEarth, are a gift that nature has produced for the use of all humanity, today and tomorrow. \nIt\u2019s something that due to its indispensable value to life, belongs to all members of the \nwhole human race and represents more than the sum of individual interests of states. It is \na supreme value and primordial resource. \n \n \n\nARTICLE 12 \n \n\nThe Patrimonial Dimension \n \nThe supreme vital value for humanity, the principle of intergenerational equity and the \nexistence of the \u2018right\u2019 of future generations to receive and enjoy an ecological space that \nsupports their survival confers a patrimonial dimension to the Earth System state within \nthe limits of a Safe Operation Space, since the transmission of a value is the main purpose \nof the concept of heritage. \n \n\n\n\n 186 \n\n \n \n\nARTICLE 13 \n \n\nCommon Home of Humanity \n \nA planet in an undesirable state, which is not able to provide for human ecological needs, \nwill not serve as our common home. In this sense, the common home of humanity, rather \nthan the tangible geographic area of 510 million Km2 of the planet, is an intangible well-\ndefined state of the Earth System, the \u201cSafe Operating Space\u201d (i.e., a Holocene-like state \nof the Earth System). \n \n\n \nARTICLE 14 \n\n \nIntangible Space of Interconnection and Innovation \n\n \nThe evolution of the international community added to recent scientific developments on \nEarth Sciences and the need to address a growing interconnection on global governance \njustify the expansion of the restricted legal contours of the common heritage of \nhumankind or the World Heritage to new situations where the survival of the human \nspecies and life on the planet are at stake. \n \n\na) The doctrine considered the common heritage of mankind regime flexible enough \nto adapt to the emerging challenges the discovery of new resources and values, \nsuch as scientific research; \n\nb) It is of notable interest to understand that all the substitutes and derived concepts \ngravitating around the common heritage of mankind seek to plant a seed for the \ndevelopment of a normative framework as to offer alternatives to govern the \nglobal common goods, and not only the areas and resources beyond jurisdictions; \n\nc) World Heritage has already done the course from Material Cultural Heritage to \nIntangible Cultural Heritage. It seems that this same course can now be \nreproduced in relation to Natural Heritage; \n\nd) The protection of the Earth System as a World Heritage complies with the \nfunctions of UNESCO as a \u201claboratory of ideas, standard-setter, clearing house, \ncapacity-builder in Member States in UNESCO\u2019s fields of competence, and \ncatalyst for international cooperation\u201d. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n 187 \n\n7.4. PART 3 - PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE INTANGIBLE \n\nNATURAL SPACE \n\n \n \n\nARTICLE 15 \n \n\nCommon Heritage of Humankind and World Heritage Evolution \n \nThe Earth System within the limits of a Holocene-like state is a vital primordial resource \nthat belongs to all humanity, present and future. By this fact it exists simultaneously inside \nand outside all sovereignties, and demands one theoretical evolution on the Common \nHeritage of Humankind and World Heritage concepts, which finds its expression in the \nprovisions of this Treaty. \n\n \n \n\nARTICLE 16 \n \n\nSafe Operating Space for Humankind \n \nThe human way to represent this primordial resource is throughout a set of indicators \nwithin the larger system that regulates the stability of the Earth System. These quantitative \ninterconnected boundary levels create the safe operating space for humankind, which \nallow for the delimitation and measurement of a non-territorial common heritage of all \nhumankind. These indicators should also function as a standard reference to guide the \nfuture management of the Earth System use. \n \n \n\nARTICLE 17 \n \n\nJust and Fair Operating Space for Humankind \n \nPlanetary boundaries are not only a safe space in biophysical terms but could also be used \nto achieve equity, fairness, and a just distribution of the remaining ecological space on \nEarth. \n \n \n\nARTICLE 18 \n \n\nGovernance System \n \nThe planetary boundaries are a truly integrated analysis where all boundaries are \ninterconnected, where a critical transition of one boundary could have feedback \n\n\n\n 188 \n\nconsequences on the entire system. Therefore, this safe space represents more than the \nsum of the different indicators, and demands governance based on a systemic approach. \n \n \n\nARTICLE 19 \n \n\nEquity \n \nState parties have the right to use the Earth System without discrimination of any kind on \nthe basis of equality, equity and in accordance with international law and the terms of this \nTreaty. \n\n \n\nARTICLE 20 \n \n\nAccountancy \n \nThe common heritage will be this intangible space where accountability should be carried \nout by an international institution (UN) with coordinating functions, that is, if we have a \nsystem of compensation between the different performances of each state on the Earth \nSystem state, each state will try to have the best balance (difference between positive and \nnegative inputs), mainly through self-regulation. \n\n \nARTICLE 21 \n\n \nCommon Standard Pattern \n\n \nFor collective action to become possible, some structural conditions are required. One of \nthem is the ability to measure and compare each action in regard to the maintenance of \nthe favourable state of the Earth System. If equality consists of treating equally what is \nequal and inequality what is unequal, knowing what is equal and what is unequal \npresupposes a fixed point, a standard pattern that only law can offer. \n\n \n\n \nARTICLE 22 \n\n \nInternational Institutionalization \n\n \nTaking into account the characteristic of non-exclusion of access to this common vital \nresource on a global scale, the application of fundamental principles of the common \nheritage of humankind to a well-defined state of the Earth System implies that its use \nshould be managed in an international and institutionalized form. \n\n\n\n 189 \n\n \n\nARTICLE 23 \n \n\nInternational Regime \n \nState parties adhering to this Agreement hereby undertake to establish an international \nregime, including appropriate procedures, to govern the use of our primordial natural \nresource composed by a relatively stable state of the Earth System, one that is very similar \nto that of the past 12,000 years. This provision shall be implemented in accordance with \nArticle 22 of this Agreement. \n \n\n \nARTICLE 24 \n\n \nMain Purposes of the International Regime \n\n \n \n\nThe main purposes of the international regime to be established shall include: \n\n(a) Ecosystem Services of Global Interest \n \nThe Ecosystem Services of Global Common Interest are all the biogeophysical processes \nperformed by the ecosystems that contribute to regulating the stability of the Earth System \nwithin the safe operating space. These services, although originated in ecosystems located \nin territories under the jurisdiction of sovereignty states, are spread diffusely in the Earth \nSystem, providing benefits to all humankind, thus they are inevitably global and a \ncommon interest. \n \n\n(b) Credits over the Common Intangible Heritage \n \nEcosystem Services of Global Interest are considered all the benefits of the Earth System \nprovided by the biosphere. Because they contribute to the maintenance of the state of the \nEarth System within the safe operating space, they generate a credit on behalf of the state \nthat exercises sovereignty or sovereign rights over the ecosystem infrastructure that \nprovided those ecosystems services. \n\n(c) Debits over the Common Intangible Heritage \n \nThe chemical, biological and physical processes resulting from human activity that are \nconducive to pushing the Earth System out of the safe operating space generate a debit \non behalf of the state that exercises sovereignty or sovereign rights over the place where \nthis activity develops. \nBecause they undermine the stability of the Earth System, they constitute a depreciation \nof the common heritage. \n\n\n\n 190 \n\n \n (d) Common Metric \n \nIt is necessary to build a common standard pattern that represents the impacts (positive \nand negative) of each country on the structure and functioning of the Earth System. \nConceptually, this new metric should be an aggregation of indicators that represent core \nprocesses that regulate the stability and resilience of the Earth System. This new metric \nshould be based on the best available scientific knowledge. \n\n(e) Life-Support Unit \n \nThe common standard pattern could be named \u201cLSU \u2013 Life-Support Unit\u201d and should be \ncomposed of an aggregation of PB indicators (\u201ccontrol variables\u201d): stratosphere ozone \ndepletion, aerosol loading, climate change, ocean acidification, biogeochemical flows \n(e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus), novel entities, biosphere integrity, land-system change and \nfreshwater use. \n\n \n(f) EcoBalance \n \n\n Ecobalance is the difference between the positive and negative contributions of each \nState party to the maintenance of the Safe Operating Space of Humanity, that is, it is the \ndifference between the production and consumption of LSUs. It allows us to realize the \nstatus of the relationship of each state with the common heritage, and should be the base \ncriteria for the building of a system of contributions and compensations for its \nmaintenance. \n\n \n\n(g) System of Contributions \n \nThe basic criteria to establish the contributions of each state for the common heritage are \nthe different balances of each country for the maintenance of the Earth System within the \nlimits of a Holocene-like state of the planet. All parties, depending on internal policies, \nmight improve their balance relative to the common heritage, either through the \nencouragement of environmental efficiency and preservation or restoration of \necosystems. \n \n(H) An Intermediate Space \n\nThe new legal fiction of the Earth System should function as an intermediate space \nbetween State parties, where each state could understand the contributions from all the \nothers and define its own performance strategy in relation to the common heritage, taking \ninto account the prediction of the behaviour of other State parties. \n\n \n\n\n\n 191 \n\n(J) Agreed Value for Each LSU \n\nUsing all the best available economic information about costs of environmental damages \nand benefits of ecosystem services, we must construct one monetary value for the \nproduction and consumption of each LSU. This value will be defined through a \nConvention. \n\n \n\n(l) Coordination Functions \n\nWith the definition of a new object of law and governance, a new or a reconverted \ninternational organization should emerge. It should have the capacity to address the Earth \nSystem as a whole, tackle the sort of challenges we are facing and assure the coordination \ntasks. It consists of receiving and redistributing the contributions of each State party and \ngathering the different interests in play, negotiating and adopting the necessary \nresolutions. \n \n \n(m) Resilience Priority \n\nThe funds resulting from the accounting system payments should be used for setting \ncompensation and restoration agreements with countries that exercise sovereignty on \npriority ecosystems for the maintenance of the stable regulation of the Earth System. \n\n \n(n) Historical Responsibility in the Use of Common Heritage \n\n \nThe different historical responsibilities are well recognized in the use of this vital heritage \nfor humanity. The different negative and positive contributions, the previous lack of \nknowledge about the global and cumulative consequences of the human activities, and \nthe recent knowledge of the role of well-determined ecosystems, whose destruction could \nresult in abrupt consequences in the regulation of the Earth System, should be \nappropriately weighted in the formulation of correction factors in the redistribution \nsystem. The common purpose of restoring this heritage within the levels necessary to \nensure the sustainability of future generations of all the people of the world is a common \nobjective to all members of the human species. The past cannot preclude the construction \nof the future. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n 192 \n\n \n \nBIBLIOGRAFIA \n \n \nAgius, E.

O Projeto  \n\n \nNascido no Porto em 2007, o projeto Condom\u00ednio da Terra teve desde a sua origem o \n\nobjetivo de procurar solu\u00e7\u00f5es te\u00f3ricas e pr\u00e1ticas para o problema da inadequa\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\nconceito de soberania refletir a realidade global, una e interdependente do Sistema \n\nTerrestre. Este projeto transformou-se na Casa Comum da Humanidade que hoje \u00e9 uma \n\nparceria internacional que junta juristas e cientistas ligados \u00e0s ci\u00eancias naturais e sociais \n\nde todo o mundo no \u00e2mbito de uma parceria informal entre o Curso de Doutoramento em \n\nEcologia Humana da Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Universidade do Porto, Universidade \n\nde Coimbra, University of Auckland e o Instituto International de Derecho y Medio \n\nAmbiente de Madrid, University de Siena (Indicadores ecol\u00f3gicos), Australian National \n\nUniversity, Planetary Boundaries/Stockholm Resilience Centre (Ci\u00eancias do Sistema \n\nTerrestre), University of Curtin in Perth Australia, e o Global Footprint Network \n\n(Metricas). Foi igualmente iniciada uma colabora\u00e7\u00e3o pr\u00f3xima com a ESA - Ag\u00eancia \n\nEspacial Europeia.  \n\nO resultado desta j\u00e1 longa investiga\u00e7\u00e3o aponta como origem estrutural da trag\u00e9dia \n\nresultante do uso desregulado do Sistema Terrestre, o facto do Sistema Terrestre n\u00e3o \n\nexistir juridicamente, cujo o resultado d\u00e1 origem a que ser utilizado como res nullius. \n\nEssa ser\u00e1 mesmo a primeira causa estrutural da crise ecol\u00f3gica.  \n\nA motiva\u00e7\u00e3o aglutinadora desta equipe multidisciplinar de acad\u00e9micos de diferentes \n\n\u00e1reas, foi o reconhecimento de que uma nova abordagem jur\u00eddica global \u00e9 um pressuposto \n\npara a constru\u00e7\u00e3o de uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o que nos permitir\u00e1 construir a Casa Comum, onde a \n\ninterliga\u00e7\u00e3o entre direitos humanos e meio ambiente pode encontrar um locus de \n\nrepresenta\u00e7\u00e3o social. A vis\u00e3o do papel central do direito e dos juristas nesta miss\u00e3o \n\npluridisciplinar, come\u00e7a a encontrar ecos um pouco por todo o mundo. Na recente \n\n\n\n 204 \n\nConference Global Pact for the Environment, que teve lugar na Universidade de \n\nColumbia, Nova York, o Prof. Jeffrey Sachs afirmou: \u201cThis initiative for a Global Pact \n\nfor the Environment calls on the world\u2019s leading jurists to help craft an agreement that in \n\nmy view should have two strong bases,\u201d said Sachs. \u201cOne is the legal framework rights \n\nto environmental safety, climate safety, protection of biodiversity, standards of behavior \n\nand clear methods for protecting those rights. The second should be a clear global \n\ngovernance based at the United Nations.\u201d Said Sachs, \u201cWe have a UN Security Council \n\nfor War and Peace. We need, in my personal view, a UN Security Council for the \n\nEnvironment.\u201d \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n8.2. Metodologia da pesquisa \n\n \n\nA forma\u00e7\u00e3o deste grupo de pessoas que suporta neste momento o projeto \u201cCasa \n\nComum da Humanidade\u201d n\u00e3o obedeceu a um plano pr\u00e9vio de sele\u00e7\u00e3o, antes pelo \n\ncontr\u00e1rio, emergiu de um processo a que poder\u00edamos chamar de sele\u00e7\u00e3o natural. Ali\u00e1s, a \n\nter existido alguma sele\u00e7\u00e3o, essa ter\u00e1 ocorrido apenas na fase elabora\u00e7\u00e3o das listas de \n\nconvidados para oradores.
