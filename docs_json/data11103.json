Bacterial reactivity was evaluated in \nthe field, at distinct estuarine boundaries, and further tested in the laboratory. \nThe ectoenzymatic degradation of peptides (activity of the leucine -\naminopeptidase E.C. 3.4.11) and carbohydrates (activity of the ? -glucosidase \nE.C. 3.2.21) and the parameters describing the uptake of glucose (Vm and Tr), \nwere used as proxies for the assessment of bacterial metabolic responses. \nWithin the estuarine gradient, the profiles of bacterial abundance, glucose \nuptake and ectoenzymatic activity generally agreed with a curvilinear pattern \nwith maxima within the 20-30 PSU range. At the transition from the limnetic \nenvironment to the main body of the estuary, a shift in the utilization of organic \nsubstrates occurred with an increasing importance of proteins over \ncarbohydrates with decreasing distance to the sea.  \nBacterioplankton activity decreased at both riverine and oceanic boundaries \nmore than expected from conservative dilution, therefore confirming the \nreactive nature of bacterial metabolism at these highly unstable estuarine \ninterfaces. \nDiffusion chambers were used to test in the laboratory the responses of natural \nbacterial assemblages from distinct estuarine sections to short-term variations \nin water properties. Rapid and intense shifts between levels of activity \nconfirmed the high degree of susceptibility of bacterial activity rates to \nenvironmental modulation and suggest that the control is mostly exerted \nthrough the dissolved pool of substrates.  \nThe influence of sediment resuspension and of the input of particles from the \nintertidal zones on the rates of bacterioplankton activity in the water column \ncould not be clearly demonstrated.  \nAlthough shallow biotopes account for the majority of the area corresponding to \nthe complex estuarine system of Ria de Aveiro, most of the aerobic \nmineralization of organic matter occurs in the planktonic compartment. The tidal \nexchange of water between the estuary and sea results in a net seaward flux of \nbacterial communities and associated activities expressed by a coastal plume \nof enhanced bacterioplankton standing stocks and heterotrophic potential.  \n \n\n \n\n\n\nBacteriopl\u00e2ncton da Ria de Aveiro:  \nactividade ectoenzim\u00e1tica e metabolismo de mon\u00f3meros \n\n \n \n \n \n\n(Bacterioplankton ectoenzymatic activity and monomer uptake in the Ria de Aveiro) \n\n\n\n \n \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n \n \n\nJustification and objectives 1 \nChapter I Introduction 5 \n Bacterioplankton in the estuarine environment 5 \n 1.

The metabolic flexibility of the estuarine biota results in \nhigh rates of primary and secondary production (Cade\u00e9, 1986; Sherr and Sherr, 1996). \nEstuaries have always been preferential settlement sites: (1) they are semi-enclosed natural \nharbours; (2) they effectively trap nutrients and are rich in sources of food; (3) they are \nnatural transport centres connecting oceans and inland waters (Cronin, 1967). However, \nhuman activities may significantly change the organic matter loading, and physical factors, \nsuch as wind and water circulation, are capable of changing estuarine conditions over small \ntemporal scales (Schulz Jr and Ducklow, 2000).  \n\nCoastal eutrophication is a problem that assumes a particular relevance in estuarine \necology. If the definition of estuary is extended to include all the transition zones between \nrivers and oceans, estuaries are the major contributors to the loading of open oceans with \norganic and inorganic materials (Martin and Gordeev, 1982). There is however, an \nincreasing awareness of the modulating role of system-specific attributes that lead to \nmarked differences in the sensibility of the distinct estuarine systems (Cloern, 2001). The \nunderstanding of estuaries as physical, chemical and biological filters (Morris et al., 1995; \nBillen and Garnier, 1997; Cloern, 2001) enhances the importance of research programs that \nprovide fundamental information on mechanistic models connecting biological processes \nand natural or human-related environmental variability.  \n\nThe understanding of the importance of planktonic bacterial and viral communities of \nthe Ria de Aveiro, either as indicators of sanitary quality or as mediators of biological \nprocesses of self-purification, justified the development of some preliminary investigation \non the dynamics of bacterioplankton and viral indicators of environmental contamination: \nResearch Project JNICT 87/122 \u2013 Geographic variation and seasonal fluctuation of \nbacterial populations of the Ria de Aveiro (1987-1990); Research Project INIC-2H - \nGeographic variation and seasonal fluctuation of bacterial populations of the Ria de Aveiro \nII. Effects of toxic pollutants (1991-1992); Research Project ENVIREG \u2013 Study of the \nvirological situation of the Ria de Aveiro and of the impacts of urban sewage effluents.  \n\nThe project Polaveiro - Microbiological and chemical quality of the water of Ria de \nAveiro, corresponded to a combined effort of regular monitoring of biological and \nchemical indicators of water quality between 1989 and 1994. Even though the \nmicrobiological component of this study was focused on the evaluation of the seasonal and \n\n\n\nJustification and objectives \n \n\n 2 \n\ngeographic variability of bacterioplankton standing stocks and on the abundance of \nspecific groups of bacterial indicators, it provided valuable information on the \nmicrobiology of the Ria and is still a reference for comparative analysis and assessment of \nanthropogenic impacts.  \n\nThe contribution of bacteria to total planktonic respiration and secondary biomass \nproduction can vary significantly between different systems but their importance generally \nincreases with increasing eutrophication and organic loading (Hoppe et al., 1998). \nBacterioplankton communities in the estuarine environment respond to changes in ambient \ntemperature (Christian and Karl, 1995), salinity (Hoppe et al., 1996), concentration of \nparticles (Fuks et al., 1991), light intensity (Pakulski et al., 1998), and general nutritional \nenvironment (Rath et al., 1993; Christian and Karl, 1995; Hoppe et al., 1998). Bacterial \nresponses to changing water properties are generally stronger in terms of total and specific \nactivity rates than in terms of abundance (Chin- Leo and Benner, 1992; del Giorgio et al., \n1996; Hoppe et al., 1996). Therefore, the high spatial and temporal variability within the \nestuarine environment should be expressed by marked shifts in the rates of biological \nprocesses mediated by the heterotrophic bacteria of the plankton.  \n\n \nThe general objective of this work was the understanding of the mechanisms of \n\nreactivity of estuarine bacterioplankton to short time and/or short distance variability of \nenvironmental factors at the boundaries of the estuarine system of Ria de Aveiro. Processes \nof polymer hydrolysis and monomer uptake were taken as a proxy to the potential role of \nbacterioplankton in the turnover of autochthonous and allochthonous organic matter within \nthe estuary.  \n\nThe accomplishment of the general objective was attempted by specifically \naddressing the following questions: \n\na) What are the relative contributions of superficial sediments and overlaying \nwater to the mineralization of organic matter in a shallow estuarine system? \n\nb) How do the patterns of bacterioplankton degradation and recycling of \norganic matter respond to an estuarine gradient of changing environmental \nconditions? \n\nc) Can bacterioplankton from extreme estuarine sections adapt to changing \nenvironmental conditions to the point of evolving into functionally distinct \ncommunities or are the rates of heterotrophic processes mostly modulated by \nwater properties? \n\nd) What is the contribution of particulate materials resuspended from bottom \n\n\n\nJustification and objectives \n \n\n 3 \n\nsediments or washed out from the salt marshes to the reactivity of bacterial \nheterotrophic activities in the water column? \n\ne) How do bacterioplankton communities respond to marine influences at the \ninterface with the sea and in what way do these responses affect the patterns \nof exchanges between the estuary and the ocean? \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n \n\n 5 \n\n \nCHAPTER I \n\nINTRODUCTION \n \n \n\nBacterioplankton in the estuarine environment \n \n\nBacteria have been recognized as a part of the plankton for approximately a century. \nThe initial emphasis of research was set on the determination of the numbers of organisms \nand on the identification and physiological characterization of species that grew in the \nlaboratory. Latter techniques allowed a more realistic estimation of bacterial abundance \nand brought new interest into the role of planktonic bacteria in the degradation and \nrecycling of organic matter and as food sources for higher levels of pelagic food chains. \nDuring the last 20 years, important information on the contribution of bacterioplankton to \nbiogeochemical cycles in diverse environments has allowed a better understanding of the \ncomplex net of variables that intervene in the regulation of bacterial dynamics. Molecular \ntechniques are now being used to characterize the large unculturable fraction of species in \nthe bacterioplankton communities. The integration of knowledge on bacterial physiology \ngathered from laboratory approaches with information on community composition and \ndiversity obtained through culture- independent techniques will probably, in a near future, \nprovide new insights into regulatory factors of bacterioplankton abundance and activity in \nnature. \n \n \n1. Bacterioplankton abundance and diversity \n \n\nBacteria are the least variable component of plankton in terms of both total density \nand biomass (del Giorgio et al., 1996) contributing with approximately 20 % to total \nplankton biomass (Fuhrman et al., 1980; Williams, 1984). However, the density of \ncommunities of marine and estuarine bacterioplankton can vary considerably between \ndistinct environments.  \n\nThe lower limit of the range of reported bacterial densities can be set by values below \n109 cells l-1, found in Arctic water (Ritzrau et al., 1997), in Eastern Antarctica (Leaky et \nal., 1996), in a cold temperate coastal Japanese lagoon (Sime-Ngando et al., 1999) or in \nmarine water layers below the photic zone (Kuipers et al., 2000). At the upper limit of the \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n \n\n 6 \n\nrange, bacterioplankton densities above 1010 cells l-1 have been observed in temperate \nestuarine systems (Shiah and Ducklow, 1994), tidal salt- marsh creeks (Shiah and Ducklow, \n1995) and coastal lagoons (Barbosa, 1991; Hoppe et al., 1996). \n\nIn open oceanic waters, the variation of bacterial abundance defines clear vertical \npatterns characterised by the decrease of the community density below the photic zone \n(K\u00fcnnis, 1991; Ritzrau et al., 1997; Kuipers et al., 2000), or below the thermocline (Gast \nand Gocke, 1988) and, on the contrary, some increase within the chemoclines at the \ninterface between oxic and anoxic waters (Gast and Gocke, 1988; Karrasch and Hoppe, \n1991) and at the benthic boundary layer (Ritzrau et al., 1997; Drake et al., 1998).  \n\nIn estuaries, longitudinal patterns of variation often develop corresponding to a \nseaward decrease of bacterial abundance. Estuarine maxima are more often found at the \nupper (Palumbo and Fergusson, 1978) or mid (Wright and Coffin, 1983) estuarine sections. \nSimilarly, bacterial abundance within estuarine plumes tends to decrease with increasing \ndistance from shore (Fuhrman et al., 1980). Estuarine systems also exhibit strong short-\nterm temporal fluctuations of bacterioplankton abundance associated to tidal effects and \ngenerally characterised by increasing density of the communities in low tide, relatively to \nhigh tide (Shiah and Ducklow, 1995; Hoppe et al., 1996). \n\nThe major factors involved in the regulation of bacterioplankton standing stocks may \nvary significantly, both seasonal and geographically. Strong positive relations with \nphytoplankton biomass are often found in costal environments (V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4nen, 1980; Ritzrau et \nal., 1997; Poremba et al., 1999; Fandino et al., 2001) but in estuaries bacterial growth may \nbe uncoupled from phytoplankton biomass since nutrient supply is related to other sources \nrather than local primary production (Shiah and Ducklow, 1995; Hoppe et al., 1996; \nZdanowski and Figueiras, 1999). \n\nHydrographical variability driven by physical factors may significantly affect \nbacterial abundance. Zdanowski and Figueiras (1997) found that 60 % of the variability in \nthe density of bacterial communities in surface waters of Ria de V\u00edgo could be explained \nby physical factors such as solar radiation, water temperature, runoff or coastal upwelling. \nTemperature is probably the most referred controlling factor of bacterial standing stocks. \nThe positive influence of increasing temperature on bacterial growth is expressed by \nincreasing bacterial abundance during warm seasons (Kirstein, 1991) or by denser \ncommunities found above marine thermoclines (K\u00fcnnis, 1991). Temperature limitation \nmay even be stronger than nutrient limitation in the estuarine environment (Shiah and \nDucklow, 1994; Shiah and Ducklow, 1995). The regulatory effect of temperature over \ncommunity size is stronger on the free- living fraction whereas the proportion of particle-\n\n\n\nIntroduction \n \n\n 7 \n\nattached cells is more related to the concentration of particulate matter (Unanue et al., \n1992; Crump et al., 1998). \n\nThe effect of salinity on bacterial density in estuarine waters is sometimes referred as \nminor, compared to biological, physical and other chemical factors. However, negative \nrelations between salinity and either total bacterioplankton abundance or, in particular, the \nparticle-attached fraction, have been found in estuarine gradients (V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4nen, 1980; Vald\u00e9s \nand Albright, 1981; Painchaud et al., 1987; Chin-Leo and Benner, 1992).  \n\nBiological factors such as grazing or viral lysis may also assume relevant roles in the \nregulation of bacterioplankton standing stocks. Increased grazing-related bacterial \nmortality has been found in cold marine waters during austral summer (Leakey et al., \n1996) and at the lower limit of salinity gradients (Guixa-Boixareu et al., 1996) and the \neffects are more pronounced in the active fraction of the community, which is often \ncoincident with the larger cell-size class (Gasol et al., 1995). Viral lysis has been cited as a \nmortality factor particularly important in the estuarine environment. It was found that \naproximatly 40 % of estuarine bacteria are lysogenic and that lysis induction occurs more \nfrequently in estuarine and coastal waters that in the offshore (Jiang and Paul, 1996). \n\nConcomitantly with geographic and temporal variations in the total numbers of cells, \nit has been demonstrated that significant shifts in the composition of bacterioplankton \ncommunities may occur. Culture- independent approaches to the composition of \ncommunities, such as the analysis of 16S rDN A sequences or fluorescence in situ \nhybridisation with specific oligonucleotide probes (FISH), show that the structure of \nbacterial assemblages may reflect changes in water column stability, depth, season or \ntrophic status (Donner et al., 1996; Murray et al., 1998).  \n\nThe degree of bacterial diversity in estuarine environments is expected to be high due \nto the dynamic nature of these particular environments and to the inputs of colonised \nparticles from various sources (Crump et al., 1999). Members of the essentially \nunculturable Cytophaga-Flavobacterium cluster compose one of the most abundant groups \nin marine ecosystems (Cottrell and Kirchman, 2000; Eilers et al., 2000; Pinhassi and \nHagstr\u00f6m, 2000). Contrastingly, members of the beta subclass of the Proteobacteria are \nmostly found in fresh water systems and members of the alpha and gamma subclasses of \nthe Proteobacteria have been detected both in marine and in freshwater assemblages \n(Gl\u00f6ckner et al., 1999). \n\nThe variability in the composition of bacterioplankton communities over small \nhorizontal distances was found to be minimal (Murray et al., 1998) but significant \ndifferences between communities were found over larger geographic scales (Lee and \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n \n\n 8 \n\nFuhrman, 1991; Murray et al., 1996; Hagstr\u00f6m et al., 2000). Shifts in the composition of \nbacterioplankton communities have been related to seasonal fluctuations of abundance in \ncoastal waters (Murray et al., 1998; Pinhassi and Hagstr\u00f6m, 2000) and longitudinal \nprofiles of bacterial abundance and activity along estuarine gradients (Murray et al., 1996). \nIn vertical profiles along the water column, layers of increased turnover of organic matter \nare characterised by increased bacterial diversity (H\u00f6fle and Brettar, 1995) and marked \nshifts in community composition are also related to chemoclines (Donner et al., 1996; \nRamsing et al., 1996). \n\nCulture- independent techniques have also been used to compare the free-living and \nthe particle-attached estuarine bacterial communities. The contribution of particle-attached \ncells to total abundance can be rather variable but usually below 10 % (Almeida and \nAlc\u00e2ntara, 1992; Unanue et al., 1992; Fandino et al., 2001) and the proportion increases at \nthe estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) section (Crump et al., 1998). High-resolution \nelectrophoresis of low molecular weight RNAs (5S rRNA and tRNA) showed that the \nparticle-attached and the free- living communities of bacterioplankton of Chesapeake Bay \nwere different in composition (Bidle and Fletcher, 1995). A similar conclusion was \nredrawn from terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (T-RFLP) of \nbacterioplankton from Eastern Mediterranean (Moeseneder et al., 2001). Results have also \ndemonstrated that the particle-attached estuarine bacterial communities are geographically \nmore stable in composition than free- living assemblages, which include a large fraction of \nbacterial groups also found in coastal or riverine waters (Crump et al., 1999; Hollibaugh et \nal., 2000). In this scenario, particle-attached bacterioplankton would be more \nrepresentative of the \u201ctrue\u201d estuarine communities than the more variable free- living \nfraction. \n \n \n2. Bacterioplankton heterotrophic activity \n \n2.1. Substrate sources for estuarine heterotrophic bacterioplankton \n\n \nEstuaries are important sites for the degradation of terrestrial, riverine, oceanic and \n\nestuarine organic matter. Heterotrophic bacteria intervene in the processes of organic \nmatter transformation within the planktonic compartment by performing two major \nfunctions: they respire organic compounds to inorganic forms and they incorporate organic \nmatter into new bacterial biomass. \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n \n\n 9 \n\nThe nutritional environment for estuarine bacteria is chemically complex, spatially \nheterogeneous and subject to temporal and geographic variations. Although seasonal \nvariations of bacterioplankton abundance and activity are sometimes correlated with \nphytoplankton standing stocks with a lag time of a few weeks (Jonas and Tuttle, 1990) \nautochthonous phytoplankton primary production is often insufficient to supply the \npotential dema nd of estuarine bacterioplankton for organic forms of carbon and nitrogen \n(Jugnia et al., 1999; Bode et al., 2001; Almeida* et al., submitted).  \n\nDuring warm periods, amino acid incorporation (Rosenstock and Simon, 1993) and \nbacterial biomass production (Chin- Leo and Benner, 1992) may exceed planktonic primary \nproduction and under low productivity and high estuarine flushing conditions material \nderived derived from higher plants gains relevance (Otero et al., 2000).  \n\nFindlay et al. (1992) estimated that the amount of allochthonous carbon necessary to \nsupport bacterial productivity at the Hudson River estuary (USA) would correspond to 3-6 \ntimes the net carbon fixation by phytoplankton. A similar carbon budget calculated for the \nWesterschelde estuary (The Nethe rlands) also shows a strong imbalance between auto- and \nheterotrophic processes with a yearly community respiration corresponding to 4-35 times \nthe net production (Soetaert and Herman, 1995). However, experimental results indicate \nthat phytoplankton-derived organic compounds are preferred as substrates for bacterial \ngrowth, producing the highest bacterial growth efficiencies (Cherrier et al., 1996). \n\nThere is a general consensus around the preponderance of dissolved and polymeric \nsubstrates in aquatic environments (Chr\u00f3st et al., 1989; Chr\u00f3st, 1991). The concentration \nof simple molecules that can directly enter bacterial cells is often in the pico- nanomolar \nrange (Chr\u00f3st, 1991; Keil and Kirchman, 1999). In estuaries, the concentration of total \namino acids, peptides, proteins and simple carbohydrates ranges from &lt;10 \u00b5gC l-1 to \nseveral mgC l-1 (review by Pomeroy and Wiebe, 2001). \n\nPolysaccharides account for approximately 50% of marine dissolved organic matter \n(DOM) in surface waters but the proportion is reduced to half this value below the photic \nzone (Benner et al., 1992). Glucose may account for 50-80 % of the monosaccharide pool \nand supply for approximately 25 % of C-demand for bacterial biomass production in the \nocean (Rich et al., 1996). It is estimated that neutral sugars and amino acids account for \n14% and 7% of marine DOM, respectively. These two classes of molecules are highly \nbioreactive and their selective removal from the water column by heterotrophic \nbacterioplankton may account for half the early consumption of organic carbon (Amon et \nal., 2001).  \n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n \n\n 10 \n\n \n2.2. Ectoenzymatic activity and monomer uptake \n\n \nThe general model of transference of organic matter to bacterial cells corresponds to \n\na flux from polymeric to simple substrates that are later up taken by bacteria. The remote \nsources of DOM for heterotrophic bacterioplankton are particulate (algae, zooplankton, \norganic detritus, other bacterial cells) so, gradients of nutrient availability in aquatic \nenvironments are a common feature (Azam and Cho, 1987). These sources may provide \nsubstrates in a continuous manner or in pulses and the heterotrophic bacterioplankton must \ntake advantage of gradients of nutrients and of intermittent periods of enhanced substrate \ninputs.  \n\nSince only low-molecular-weight (LMW) compounds and simple molecules can be \ndirectly transferred from the environment into the cells, the first step of the DOM-bacteria \npathway is dependent upon bacterial hydrolytic enzymes. Ectoenzymes develop their \nactivity as close as possible to permeases in order to take maximum advantage of \nmonomer-rich micro zones surrounding intense polymer degradation sites. Several \nexperimental works have demonstrated that bacterial hydrolytic enzymes are physically \nbound to the cell surface or occur in the periplasmic space of gram- negative bacteria. \nMartinez and Azam (1993) found that approximately 30 % of aminopeptidase activity in a \nmarine bacterium was associated to the cell-surface and 70 % was periplasmic. This is \nconsistent with a model in which surface enzymes directly react with polymers and \ngenerate oligomers that diffuse into the periplasm. Further hydrolysis occurs in a high \nectoenzymatic activity environment where monomers may directly interact with substrate-\nbinding proteins or with permeases (Martinez and Azam, 1993). Extracellular degradation \nof organic compounds has important implications in the processing of particulate \nsubstrates because the conversion of particles into solutes prevents substrates sources from \nsinking and being lost from the water column and makes them inaccessible to particle \nfeeders (Azam and Cho, 1987). \n\nCoupling polymer hydrolysis and monomer uptake allows bacterioplankton to take \nmaximum profit from punctual sources o DOM. This coupling is particularly tight in \noligotrophic environments or during low productivity periods and the ratio between uptake \nand hydrolysis rates provides a measure of the pool size ratio between monomers and \npolymers (Hoppe et al., 1988). Considering that the relative importance of polymers \nincreases with increasing eutrophication, uncoupling between hydrolysis and uptake can \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n \n\n 11 \n\noccur during spring blooms (Middelboe et al., 1995) or in highly eutrophied coastal \necosystems (Hoppe et al., 1988).  \n\nThe co-existence of high and low affinity hydrolytic and uptake enzyma tic systems is \none important strategy in the interaction of bacterioplankton and organic matter because it \nprovides bacterioplankton communities with the metabolic flexibility to utilize low bulk-\nphase concentrations of substrates and high nutrient concent rations in the vicinity of \ndiscrete sources of DOM (Hollibaugh and Azam, 1983; Tholosan et al., 1999; Unanue et \nal., 1999). The maintenance of distinct enzymatic systems allows rapid responses to shifts \nin substrate availability that are expressed by changes in the levels of per-cell activity rates \n(Wehr et al., 1999). Transition between systems occurs at different concentration ranges \nfor different enzymes and is more pronounced for hydrolytic than for uptake systems \n(Unanue et al., 1999). Studies of biphasic kinetics in natural bacterioplankton assemblages \nshow that the coupling between hydrolysis and uptake observed under low ambient \nconcentrations of substrates corresponds to situations of high affinity hydrolytic \nectoenzymes and low affinity uptake systems operating simultaneously (Unanue et al., \n1999). \n\n \n \n\n2.3. Environmental regulation of bacterial activity \n \nEnvironmental factors interact in the regulation of bacterioplankton activity in such a \n\nway that it is often difficult to discriminate between individual effects and to assess their \nrelative contribution. \n\nSubstrate availability and temperature interact in all bacterial communities, at \ndifferent temperature and substrate concentration ranges (Psenner and Sommaruga, 1992; \nJugnia et al., 1999; Pomeroy and Wiebe, 2001).  \n\nBacteria respond to changes in organic matter availability by shifting between levels \nof activity. As a general trend, increasing rates of bacterial biomass production, \nectoenzymatic activity and uptake rates have been extensively reported during \nphytoplankton blooms (Chr\u00f3st et al., 1989; Chr\u00f3st, 1991; Middelboe et al., 1995), in the \nproximity of particulate sources of DOM (Martinez et al., 1996; Ritzrau et al., 1997; \nTholosan et al., 1999; Grossart and Ploug, 2001) or along gradients of increasing \neutrophication (Rath et al., 1993; Christian and Karl, 1995; Hoppe et al., 1998).  \n\nExperimental addition of organic matter to bacterioplankton communities shows that \nresponses are not only related to the concentration of available organic carbon but also to \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n \n\n 12 \n\nthe quality of substrates. Terrestrial detritus were found to be relatively refractory whereas \nalgal-derived material produces significant stimulation of growth (Wehr et al., 1999). \nDissolved substrates produced stronger stimulation than particulate material of identical \nsources (Cherrier et al., 1996; Ferrier-Pag\u00e8s et al., 2000).  \n\nMonomer incorporation and ectoenzymatic activity measure different cellular \nprocesses. Uptake of simple substrates involves membrane transport and intracellular \nmetabolic functions and is interpreted as an indicator of growth. Ectoenzymatic activity \nmeasures the expression of cell-bound enzymes and the potential for the hydrolysis of \npolymeric substrates that ultimately reflects the spectra of recent substrates to which \nbacteria have been exposed. Therefore, additions of simple substrates may trigger distinct \nresponses of these two metabolic indicators. Additions of monosaccharides and amino \nacids stimulate monomer uptake (Berman et al., 1994) but decrease ectoenzymatic activity \nrates either by end-product inhibition or by catabolic repression (Chr\u00f3st, 1991). \n\nIn the estuarine environment bacterial growth is generally not limited by carbon \navailability but rather by nitrogen (Chin- Leo and Benner, 1992). In oligotrophic waters \nbacteria compete with phytoplankton for dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) whereas in \neutrophic waters they mineralise dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) to DIN (J\u00f8rgensen et \nal., 1999). Dissolved free amino acids and ammonia are the dominant N sources for \nbacterial growth (J\u00f8rgensen et al., 1999; Middelburg and Nieuwenhuize, 2000) but the \nhydrolysis of dissolved combined amino acids (DCAA) coupled to amino acid uptake can \nsupport approximately 50% of bacterial nitrogen demand and 25% of the carbon demand \nin estuarine and coastal waters (Keil and Kirchman, 1999). \n\nThe regulatory effect of temperature on bacterial metabolism may prevail over \nnutrient supply during the cold season (Shiah and Ducklow, 1995) or in stratified \nenvironments (Patel et al., 2000) and generally bacterial activity rates are positively \ncorrelated with temperature (Christian and Karl, 1995; Simon and W\u00fcnsch, 1998; Patel et \nal., 2000). One important indirect effect of temperature is that it affects the affinity of \nenzymatic systems. Under low temperature the affinity of enzymatic systems decreases \nsignificantly and labile substrates may accumulate in the environment because they \nbecome less bioavailable (Zweifel, 1999; Pomeroy and Wiebe, 2001). \n\nSalinity generally correlates poorly with bacterioplankton metabolic activity \nmeasures in estuarine bacterioplankton (Murrell et al., 1999) and since in estuaries salinity \ngradients also correspond to trophic gradients, individual effects become difficult to \ninterpret. A relatively high salinity optimum (30 PSU) was reported for ? -glucosidase  \n(E.C. 3.2.21) activity in intertidal sediments (King, 1986) but the potential activity of the \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n \n\n 13 \n\nsame ectoenzyme was negatively related to salinity in coastal waters (Murrell et al., 1999). \nThe relation between leucine-aminopeptidase (E.C. 3.4.11) activity and salinity in coastal \nsystems was found to be positive in some environments (Murrell et al., 1999) and negative \nin others (Hoppe et al., 1996; Pattel et al., 2000). Strong decreases of monomer uptake \nwith increasing salinity have also been observed (Vald\u00e9s and Albright, 1981; Hoppe et al., \n1996). \n\nLight is generally not among the major factors controlling estuarine bacterioplankton \nactivity rates. However photo inhibition of thymidine and leucine uptake was observed in a \nshallow coastal system (Pakulski et al., 1998). Contrastingly, the photodegradation of \nrecalcitrant DOM into more labile compounds has been related to the stimulation of the \ngrowth of marine bacterioplankton populations (Benner and Biddanda, 1998). Light \nintensity also influences rates of primary production and therefore causes indirect effects \non the availability of substrates for bacterial growth and influences the outcome of the \ncompetition between phyto- and bacterioplankton for inorganic nutrients (Sanford et al., \n2001). These indirect effects of light and the concomitant variations in the concentration of \norganic and inorganic nutrients may originate diel rhythms of variation of bacterial activity \nrates in environments where primary production and bacterial organic matter utilization are \ntightly coupled (Gasol et al., 1998; Kormas et al., 1998; Kuipers et al., 2000). \n\n \n \n\n2.4. Bacterioplankton dynamics at estuarine boundaries  \n \nThe water column of estuarine systems is physically and functionally connected to \n\nthe terrestrial, riverine and oceanic environments and establishes also tight relations with \nintertidal margins. Bacterioplankton experiences spatial and temporal variations according \nto the intensity of environmental pressure at these interfaces. \n\n \nThe benthic boundary  \nResuspension of bottom sediments caused by tidal currents, wind- induced waves or \n\nanthropogenic disturbance is an important process of exchange of materials between the \nbenthic and the planktonic compartments in shallow coastal systems (Demers et al., 1987; \nTrousselier et al., 1993; Sloth et al., 1996).  \n\nThe susceptibility to resuspension is subjected to seasonal and geographic \nfluctuations in relation to sediment texture and microphytobenthic colonization (de Jonge \nand van den Bergs, 1987). Experimental results show that the critical current speed \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n \n\n 14 \n\nincreases considerably in fine sediments highly colonised by diatoms when compared to \nsandy sediments with low microphytobenthic biomass (Lucas et al., 2000). \n\nPulses of nutrients associated to resuspension events result in increased rates of \nheterotrophic activity of bacteria in the adjacent water column. Experimental disturbance \nof benthic sediments in either flume or mesocosm experiments produced significant \nincreases of bacterial abundance, biomass productivity and potential ectoenzymatic activity \n(Wainright, 1987; Chr\u00f3st and Riemann, 1994; Sloth et al., 1996). \n\nThe superimposition of tidally- induced sediment resuspension, salinity-related \nflocculation of riverine materials and density gradients, results in the maintenance of \nsuspended particles inside the estuaries and in the occurrence of estuarine turbidity maxima \n(Vale and Sundby, 1982; Brenon and Le Hir, 1999). These estuarine sections are \ncharacterised by high rates of bacterial activity (Fuks et al., 1991) and by an increase in the \ncontribution of particle-attached bacteria to total activity rates (Griffith et al., 1990; Crump \net al., 1998; Hollibaugh and Wong, 1999; Murrell et al., 1999). Attachment to particles \nalso prevents estuarine planktonic bacteria from being washed out of a favourable \nnutritional environment (Murrell et al., 1999). \n\nProcesses of transference between sediments and the water column under low current \nvelocities are mostly driven by salinity gradients and involve exchanges of solutes rather \nthan particulate materials. Differences of salinity between interstitial and overlaying water \ncause the density displacement and advection of solutes from estuarine sediments into the \nwater column (von Bodungen et al., 1995; Webster et al., 1996). Bacterioplankton growing \nin water experimentally exposed to sediments showed higher biomass production rates and \nthe stimulation corresponded to a net flux of DOM from the sediments to the water column \n(Hopkinson et al., 1998; Middelboe et al., 1998). Field results also show that bacterial \nabundance and activity at the water layer directly above the sediment are higher that at the \nintermediate layer in open ocean waters (Ritzrau et al., 1997) or than in surface waters of \nshallow estuarine systems (Goosen et al., 1995) suggesting that benthic-derived substrates \nmay fuel heterotrophic activity in the water column. \n\n \n \nThe fresh-water boundary \nVariations of the fresh-water fluxes are one of the major factors of seasonal control \n\nof estuarine biological activity (Cloern and Nichols, 1985). High inputs of particulate \nmaterials occur during periods of elevated fresh-water fluxes (Otero et al., 2000) and the \nnutritional quality of seston (Murrell et al., 1999), as well as the contribution of \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n \n\n 15 \n\nphytoplankton and bacterial biomass to total particulate organic carbon (POC), \n(Hollibaugh and Wong, 1999) decrease during dry periods. Plant-derived material \ntransported by rivers may assume a dominant role as source of organic carbon for estuarine \nheterotrophs during periods of low autochthonous production (Otero et al., 2000). Fresh-\nwater flow, taken as a proxy for organic matter flux, was positively correlated with several \nbacterioplankton metabolic indicators such as ectoenzymatic activity, monomer uptake, \ngrowth rates and growth efficiency (Benner et al., 1995; Murrell et al., 1999). \n\nUpper sections of estuarine systems also receive inputs of fresh-water bacterial \ncommunities. Although their growth may experience some stimulation at the upper \nestuarine sections, the increase of salinity causes sharp decrease of monomer uptake \n(Vald\u00e9s and Albright, 1981) and growth rates (Painchaud et al., 1995). \n\n \n \nThe inter-tidal boundary \nSalt marshes and mud- flats are generally considered as estuarine compartments of \n\nenhanced primary production (Buzzelli et al., 1999; Ser\u00f4dio and Catarino, 2000) and \nrespiration rates (Taylor and Allanson, 1995; Cai et al., 1999). Exchanges of materials \nbetween the estuarine margins and the water column result from cyclic flooding and \nexposure of sediments in relation to tidal currents.  \n\nEarly attempts to assess the relative contribution of salt-marshes as sources of \norganic matter to adjacent coastal waters led to the formulation of the \u201coutwelling \nhypothesis\u201d according to which considerable amounts of materials would be exported from \nthe salt- marshes to the main estuarine water body (Odum, 1968; Dame et al., 1986). More \nrecently, the exchange of particulate forms of organic carbon and dissolved forms of \ninorganic nitrogen between the littoral zone and main estuarine channel has been \ndemonstrated in shallow estuarine ecosystems (Buzzelli et al., 1999). However, salt-\nmarshes are found to act predominatly as sinks for particulate matter whereas they export \nDOM forms (Taylor and Allanson, 1995). When respiration rates are high, the exports to \nthe water column are dominated by inorganic respiratory products (Cai et al., 1999) and \ninorganic forms of nitrogen and phosphorus that are used by phyto- and bacterioplankton \n(Heinle and Flemer, 1976). \n\n \n \nThe ocean boundary \nThe oceanic influences on the total size of bacterioplankton communities and on the \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n \n\n 16 \n\nactivity rates are often related to patterns of variation with distinct periodicity. The \ndecrease in abundance and activity of estuarine bacterioplankton during the flood-tide is a \nfeature of tidal estuaries (Kirchman et al., 1984; Hoppe et al., 1996; Cunha et al., 2000). \nHowever, field results often show that the tidal-associated variations of abundance and \nactivity within the bacterial communities of the water column cannot be fully explained by \nconservative dilution effects suggesting that bacterial cells react also in terms of the levels \nof individual activity (Hoppe et al., 1996; Cunha et al., 2000).  \n\nFortnight cycles of spring- neap tides affect the vertical mixture of the water column \nand the longitudinal extension of the estuarine turbidity maximum (Murrell et al., 1999), \ntherefore influencing the supply or organic and inorganic nutrients and the relations \nbetween phytoplankton and bacterioplankton biomass production.  \n\nSeasonal variations on the direction and intensity of coastal winds and on oceanic \nupwelling conditions also shape biological gradients at the estuary-ocean boundary (Cloern \nand Nichols, 1985). Coastal upwelling was positively associated with the  colony- forming \nbacterioplankton fraction (Zdanowski and Figueiras, 1999) and since it changes the degree \nof mixing of the water column and the supply of nutrients, upwelling may shift the \nlimitations of bacterioplankton growth from organic to inorganic sources (Kirchman et al., \n2000). \n\nEstuarine plumes correspond to estuarine-ocean interfaces of elevated standing stocks \nof phyto- and bacterioplankton (Malone and Ducklow, 1990) as well as intense \nheterotrophic activity (Robertson et al., 1998; J\u00f8rgenson e t  al., 1999; Pakulski et al., \n2000). Bacterial activity along estuarine gradients and transition zones considerably alters \nthe size and quality of the DOM pool that ultimately reaches oceanic waters (Raymond and \nBauer, 2000).  \n\nThe specific biological attributes of the marine- influenced lower sections of estuarine \nsystems and the dynamics of heterotrophic bacterioplankton within the plume zone may act \nas filters and considerably attenuate the effects of coastal eutrophication (Morris et al., \n1995; Billen and Garnier, 1997; Cloern, 2001). \n\n \n\n\n\nCompartments of oxygen consumption  \n \n\n 17 \n\n \nCHAPTER II \n\nCOMPARTMENTS OF OXYGEN CONSUMPTION IN A TIDAL MESOTROPHIC \nESTUARY (RIA DE AVEIRO, PORTUGAL) \n\nCunha, M. A., Almeida, M. A. and Alc\u00e2ntara, F. (1999) Acta Oecologica, 20(4):227-235 \n \n\n_________________________________________________________________________ \n \n \nAbstract - Oxygen consumption rates were determined, in parallel with primary production and bacterial \nbiomass production, as an approach to the analysis of carbon cycling in the estuarine community of the Ria \nde Aveiro. The water column of the marine zone was the major contributor (64-99 %) for the total aerobic \ncarbon remineralisation in which O2 uptake rates averaged from 80 to 127 mgO2m\n\n-2h-1, respectively at low tide \nand high tide. The planktonic consumption of O2 varied from 0.010 to 0.041 mg O2l\n\n-1h-1 with the highest values \nin the brackish zone. Small water column depths in this zone reduced, however, the integrated average \nconsumption of the plankton, per surface unit, to 57 % (LT) and 66 % (HT) of that observed in the marine \nzone. Benthic O2 consumption rates, 5.1 to 22.0 mgO2m\n\n-2h-1, were 2 to 4 times higher in the brackish zone when \ncompared to the rates in the marine zone. It represented 1 to 31% of the total surface integrated values in \ndifferent areas and at different tides. From the ratios of the primary production and bacterial biomass \nproduction, on a per surface unit basis, it is concluded that, in late autumn, the Ria de Aveiro was mostly an \nheterotrophic system with a feeble recover of primary production at HT in the marine zone and at LT in the \nbrackish water zone. \n\n \n \n\nKey words : estuary, oxygen consumption, bacterial respiration, sediment respiration, bacterial \nproductivity, primary production. \n\n \n \n\n1. Introduction  \n \n\nIn estuarine systems, autochthonous and allochthonous organic matter are transported and \ndeposited in different geographical patterns, stimulating respiration in the water column and in the \nbenthos. The partition of the aerobic metabolism among the different spatial compartments and \nphysiological groups in the community is an important tool for the evaluation of the estuarine \ncarbon cycle. \n\nThe sediment-water interface is a site of intense heterotrophic activity where nutrients are \ngenerated, percolated into the sediment and diffused out to the water column. It gives support to \nbacterial populations, which are 2-3 orders of magnitude more dense than in the water column \n(Alc\u00e2ntara et al., 1996). \n\n\n\nCompartments of oxygen consumption  \n \n\n 18 \n\nThe determination of the metabolic pattern of an ecosystem on the basis of oxygen uptake \nis relatively simple (Hargrave, 1969; Fallon and Boylen, 1990) and can be directly applied to the \nwater column and to the sediments, at quasi in situ conditions (Gocke et al., 1981; Roos and \nEriksen, 1995). Although the Winkler titration method is criticised, particularly when used in \ncases of low rates of respiration (Pamatmat, 1997), the method is still considered valuable in a \ncommunity approach. \n\nCommunity respiration represents the transfer of carbon between the organic and inorganic \nreservoirs of a system. The subtraction of bacterial respiration from autotrophic production, gives \na direct estimate of the organic carbon available for export in the system or incorporation by non-\nbacterial consumers (Yahnke and Craven, 1995). Community respiration defines limits to the \noverall partition of bacterial metabolism of dissolved organic carbon in secondary production of \nbiomass and aerobic respiration (Yahnke and Craven, 1995). \n\nThe system variation in the rate of O2 consumption involves seasonal fluctuation, with \nmaxima in summer, of the respiration rate of planktonic bacteria as was observed in the \ncontinental shelf (Grifith and Pomeroy, 1995). Estuarine sediments also show mineralization \nseasonality (Hargrave, 1969; Mallo et al., 1993) due to changing temperature and organic \nloading variation, but this fluctuation is not common to other marine systems, specially to those \naffected by low concentrations of dissolved oxygen (Conley et al., 1997). Positive effects of \nbenthic bioturbation on the rate of O2 consumption are frequent and probably due to activation of \nthe bacterial community (Hansen and Kristensen, 1997). \n\nAerobic respiration in coastal sediments is limited by oxygen penetration due to the \nresistance of the diffusive boundary layer to the flux of O2 (Y\u00f8rgensen and Revsberg, 1985). The \npenetration is variable with the composition of the sediment but, generally, it is restricted to a few \nmillimetres. \n\nThe profiles of respiratory and production activities in estuaries are shaped by many \nenvironmental factors including those related to the short-term tidal changes in water properties. \n\nThis work intends to establish preliminary values for the rates of biotic mineralisation and \ncarbon fixation in the marine and brackish water zones of the Ria de Aveiro. It is also directed to \nthe determination of the relative contributions of the different compartments, namely plankton and \nbenthos, to the total oxidation of organic carbon within this ecosystem.  \n\n \n \n \n\n2. Material and methods  \n \n\n\n\nCompartments of oxygen consumption  \n \n\n 19 \n\nN\n\nN1\n\nI6\n\nSamples were collected in 1997/98 along two transects defined one in the marine zone at \nthe main navigation channel (transect N1) and other in the inner brackish water section of the \nestuary (transect I6) (Fig.1). Transect I6 was visited on the 28th October (low tide) and on the 7th \nNovember (high tide). Samples from transect N1 were collected on the 16th December (low tide) \nand on the 9th January (high tide). All samples were collected under spring tide conditions. \n\nAlong each transect 5 equidistant subtidal stations were defined and further identified by \ntheir relative position: stations South, South-Centre, Centre, North-Centre and North at transect \nN1 and stations West, West-Centre, Centre, East-Centre and East at transect I6. \n\nFor the determination of the rate of \noxygen consumption two cores of sediment \nplus overlaying water were collected by scuba \ndivers from each station directly into \ncylindrical respiration chambers (14 cm in \ndiameter and 8 cm high) similar to those used \nby Gocke et al. (1981). The closed \nchambers were immediately immersed in \nwater from the station and transported to the \nlaboratory. Water from the bottom layer of \nthe water column (0.5 m from sediment \nsurface) was collected on boat with a Niskin \nbottle for later adjustments and preparation of \nthe respiration chambers. In the laboratory the \nwater from the station was allowed to flow \nthrough the chambers before taking the first \nsample for determination of the initial oxygen \nconcentration. The completely filled chambers \nwere sealed and incubated at in situ \ntemperature for 5-7 hours. BOD bottles were \nalso filled with bottom water for determination \nof planktonic respiration. Total aerobic \nrespiration (sediment plus water oxygen \nconsumption per m2) was calculated from the \nvalues of respiration (per volume) in the \n\nFigure 1: Ria de Aveiro, a coastal estuarine \necosystem. Sampling transects (N1, marine zone and \nI6, brackish zone) are indicated with arrows. \n\n\n\nCompartments of oxygen consumption  \n \n\n 20 \n\nchambers and in the water bottles, taking into account the total depth of the station, and the \nsurface area of the sediment in the chamber. \n\nThe sediments used for respiration assays were later used for granulometric analysis after \ntreatment with 100 V hydrogen peroxide and 20 % sodium pyrophosphate, according to the \ncategories used by Rodrigues and Quintino (1985). Organic matter content was determined \nthrough loss of dry weight after 48 hours treatment with 100 V hydrogen peroxide.  \n\nFor the determination of physical, chemical and microbiological parameters of the water \ncolumn, only the 3 stations corresponding to the margins and to the centre of the channel were \nstudied. At transect N1 (total depth of 2.0-20.6 m at HT and 2.5-12.3 m at LT) the water \nsamples were collected at surface (0.2 m from surface) and bottom (0.5 m from de sediment-\nwater interface) layers of the water column but at the shallower transect I6 (total depth of 1.7-3.0 \nm at HT and 0.3-1.8 m at LT), bottom samples were worth collecting only at the centre of the \nchannel. \n\nBacterial biomass productivity was determined according to Simon and Azam (1989) after \naddition of a saturating concentration of 30 nM 3H-leucine. Samples were incubated at in situ \ntemperature for 1 hour. The metabolism of glucose was determined by the radioisotopic \ntechnique (Gocke, 1977) with a tracing concentration of 14C-glucose (43 nM) and after 2 hours \nof incubation at in situ temperature. Percentage of glucose respiration was calculated as the ratio \nbetween the respired fraction and the total uptake of glucose (sum of respired and incorporated \nfractions). Primary production was determined by incorporation of 14C-bicarbonate (Steemann-\nNielsen, 1952) in simulated in situ conditions. All radioactive substrates were purchased from \nAmersham. \n\nSalinity, temperature and dissolved oxygen were determined in the field with WTW \nequipment.  \n\n \n \n\n3. Results \n \n\nA brief characterisation of the marine and brackish-water zones of the Ria de Aveiro can \nbe derived from the values of salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, granulometry and organic \ncontent of the sediments at, respectively, transects N1 and I6 (Tables 1 and 2). In the marine \nzone, the average values of salinity at the surface water for the 3 sampling stations of the transect \nwere 33.3 UPS at HT and 23.0 UPS at LT, while at the brackish-water zone the corresponding \nvalues were 27.4 and 19.1 UPS. Temperature values determined at transect I6 were higher than \nat transect N1.

The average water depth (considering 5 stations) at this \ntransect was, however, 9.3 m at HT and 6.3 m at LT. Average depth (from 5 sampling stations) \nat transect I6 was 2.2 m at HT and 1.2 m at LT. \n\nThe granulometry of the sub-tidal sediments of the two transects did not differ drastically \n(Table 2). The coarser type of sediment (very coarse sand) was found at the north-centre station \nof transect N1 and at the west station of transect I6 and the finer (fine sand) correponded to the \neast margin of transect I6. The organic matter content of the sediments was higher at transect I6 \nwhere it reached an average value (5 stations) of 2.9 % of the dry weight, compared to 0.8 % in \ntransect N1. \n\nAt transect I6, the aerobic respiration of the benthos was more intensive and quite stable in \ncontrasting tidal conditions. The average values of O2 consumption were 22.0 and  \n21.3 mgO2m\n\n-2h-1 at HT and LT, respectively. In the marine zone the average values of respiration \nin the sediment were 5.1 and 13.8 mgO2m\n\n-2h-1, respectively at HT and LT. \n \nTable 3: Variation of primary production (PP), total respiration (R) and bacterial biomass production (BBP) \nalong transects N1 (marine zone) and I6 (brackish zone) of the Ria de Aveiro at high tide (HT) and at low tide \n(LT) expressed as mgCm-2h-1.

The averages of O2 \n\nconsumption at transect I6 were 0.030 and 0.041 mgO2l\n-1h-1, respectively at LT and HT. In the \n\nmarine zone the values decreased to 0.010 and 0.014 mgO2l\n-1h-1, at corresponding tides. \n\nTaking into consideration the total depth of the water column at each station, the \ncalculations show that the respiration in the planktonic compartment amounted, in average and as \na fraction of total consumption, to 69 % in the brackish zone and to 87 % in the marine zone \n(Figures 2B and 3B). \n\nPrimary production showed to be more intense at the brackish water zone. Average values \nat transect I6 were 4.0 and 4.5 mgCm-2h-1 respectively at HT and at LT while at transect N1 the \naverage values decreased to 1.5 and 3.5 mgCm-2h-1 at corresponding tidal conditions (Table 3).  \n\nThe values of bacterial biomass productivity and of the fraction of respired glucose indicate \nthe occurrence of higher levels of bacterial activity at the brackish water transect (Figures 2C and \n3C). The average values of bacterial biomass productivity at the surface of the water column \nacross this transect (average of 3 stations) were 5.1 and  \n5.7 \u00b5gCl-1h-1, respectively at LT and HT. The respired fraction of the absorbed glucose \ncorresponded to 10.0 and 39.2 % in the corresponding tides. The highest rates of bacterial \nactivity at the transect N1 were observed at LT. The average bacterial biomass productivity at \nthe surface of the water column was here 0.9 \u00b5gCl-1h-1 at LT and 0.3 \u00b5gCl-1h-1 at HT. Glucose \nrespiration determined on surface samples amounted to 13.2 % of the total uptake at HT and to \n5.9 % at LT. \n\n \n \n\n4. Discussion \n \n\nThe lack of detailed bathymetric and hydrological data on the Ria de Aveiro, as well as of a \nmore extensive work on the activity of the community, precludes more precise calculations of the \nintegrated values of biological activity throughout this system. Even so, the results already \nobtained in this work, regarding the marine and brackish water zones, allow a first approach to \nthe geographical and compartment distribution of carbon cycling in this system. \n\n\n\nCompartments of oxygen consumption  \n \n\n 24 \n\nThe rate of oxygen consumption determined, in a per volume unit basis, in the water column \nof the Ria de Aveiro varied from 10 to 41 \u00b5gO2l\n\n-1h-1 (Table 4), values which are within the range \nof results published for marine systems. These include a range of  \n35-47 \u00b5gO2l\n\n-1h-1 in the water of mangrove swamps (Gocke et al., 1981) and of  \n2.7 \u2013 13.3 \u00b5gO2l\n\n-1h-1 in marine water (Kruse, 1993). The values of total consumption of O2 \nobserved in the water column of the Ria de Aveiro range from 2 to 247 mgO2m\n\n-2h-1  \n(Table 4) and from values of 48 to 5928 mgO2m\n\n-2d-1. These high respiration values, indicating \neutrophication conditions, are similar to the range of 9 to 289 mmolO 2m\n\n-2d-1  \n(288-9248 mgO2m\n\n-2d-1) reported by Caffrey et al. (1998) during a spring phytoplankton bloom \nin south San Francisco Bay.  \n\n \nTable 4: Data relative to the compartments of oxygen consumption in the subtidal area of the Ria de Aveiro \n(autumn/winter 1997/98).  \n\n Marine zone(1) Brackish zone(1) Ria de Aveiro  \n\nWeighted average (2)   \n\n HT \n\n \n\nLT \n\n \n\n  HT \n\n \n\n   LT  HT LT \n\n1.Maximum and minimum depth of the \n\nwater column (m) \n\n22-6 20-4 6-1 4-0.5 - - \n\n2.Consumption of O2 in the water \n\ncolumn (mgO2l\n-1h-1) \n\n0.014 0.010 0.041 0.030 0.035 0.023 \n\n3.Total consumption of O2 in the \n\nwater column (mgO2m\n-2h-1) \n\n2-247 \n\n(122) \n\n9-153 \n\n(67) \n\n9-220 \n\n(89) \n\n8-72 \n\n(44) \n\n96 52 \n\n4.

However, the differences in the depth of the water column in \nthe two zones reversed the relation of the integrated values (per surface unit). The total rate of O2 \nconsumption in the water compartment of the marine zone is, in fact, 1.4-1.5 times higher than in \nthe brackish water zone. \n\nTable 5 shows the oxygen uptake rates determined in sediments from freshwater and \nmarine systems, with indication of the method of determination.

This \ndifference is even greater when it is taken into account the average thickness of the aerobic layer \nof the sediments (0.04 m in the marine zone and 0.01 m in the brackish water zone) (Alc\u00e2ntara et \nal., 1996). In fact, the surface layer of the sediment respired, in a per volume basis of aerobic \nsediment, 6 (LT) and 17 (HT) times more intensely in the brackish zone than in the marine zone \n(Table 4). The wide range of values of community respiration observed along each transect \nreflects differences in water depth (contribution of planktonic respiration) between sampling \nstations, differences in sediment characteristics and may also be related to changes in the density \nof zoobenthos. \n\nThe subtidal sediments of the brackish zone of the Ria showed stable rates of oxygen \nconsumption in relation to the tidal currents. The same did not happen in the marine zone, which \nexhibited 2.7 increases in the average transect values at low tide. This could be due to tidal \ndifferences in the bottom hydrodynamism (Hansen and Kristensen, 1997) and to short term \ninstability in the organic content of the interface, associated or not with the deposition of organic \nloads transported from the brackish zone during ebb tide. \n\nEstuarine sediments are considered as a privileged compartment for the accumulation, \ndeposition and mineralisation of locally produced and transported organic matter. The sediments \nof the Ria de Aveiro were 9 to 71 times more active than the water, in a per volume basis. The \nrates of oxygen consumption per surface area showed, however, that aerobic mineralisation runs \nmostly in the water column, with a relative share of 64-99 % (marine zone) and 37-95 % \n(brackish zone) of the total. This distribution of O2 consumption relative to the sediment and \nwater compartments was also observed in other systems (Gocke et al., 1981; Madenjian, 1990; \nSand-Jensen et al., 1990; Roos and Eriksen, 1995) and is indicative of high content of labile \norganic matter in the water column. \n\nThe low values of the rate of O2 consumption, in a per volume basis, in estuarine water did \nnot allow its fractionation according to plankton size, and, in particular, to bacterioplankton as \nwas intended. Anyhow, one could see that the values of bacterial respiration relative to total \nuptake of glucose (Figures 2C and 3C), agree with a more intense bacterial mineralisation, in a \nper volume unit basis, at the brackish zone and, in general, at low tide.  \n\n\n\nCompartments of oxygen consumption  \n \n\n 27 \n\nBacterial biomass productivity, determined as the rate of leucine incorporation, was taken \nas an index of metabolic activity of the bacterioplankton in spite of the degree of uncertainty \ninvolved. The high values observed at the brackish zone are in agreement with the general pattern \nof activities within the estuary. Our range of values considering all the individual stations at the \nmarine and brackish-water zones (0.05-5.7 \u00b5gCl-1h-1), fits within the range of some published \nresults (0.6-31 \u00b5gCl-1h-1) for productivity in coastal systems (Biddanda et al., 1994; Jellett et al., \n1996) with the exception of the relatively rare lower limit. The ratios of the productivity of \nbacterial biomass in the two zones (brackish/marine) of this ecosystem are 5.6 at low tide and \n21.0 at high tide. These values reflect the fact, already denoted (results for publication), that the \nproductivity of the bacterial community originating from the marine zone is not immediately \nstimulated after transport to the brackish zone during flood tide. On the contrary, the brackish \nzone bacterial community moved to the the marine zone at ebb tide can increase local productivity \nby 237 % at the surface water. \n\nThe overall estimates of oxygen consumption rates for the Ria de Aveiro are 115 (HT) and \n70 (LT) mgO2m\n\n-2h-1 (Table 4). These values take into account the higher weight of the brackish \nzones in the total subtidal area (65 % at LT; 78 % at HT) of the Ria (Silva, 1994). \n\nIn this system, and on a per surface unit basis, the aerobic carbon oxidation in daylight \nexceeded 5-9 times the carbon fixation by primary producers. This is an indication of large inputs \nof allochthonous labile organic carbon. Primary production in the Ria  \n(4.3-23.2 gCm-2y-1) compares well with production in other coastal systems  \n(25-45 gCm-2y-1, reviewed by Sherr and Sherr, 1996) but is at the lower end of the range for \nmore productive estuaries (19.7-2394 gCm-2y-1, calculated from Cad\u00e9e, 1986). \n\nBacterial metabolism of glucose revealed that only a minor fraction (less than 40%) was \nrespired. However, the evaluation of the total microbial respiration in the water column gives an \naltogether different picture. Aerobic respiration exceeded (up to 58 times) bacterial biomass \nproductions, denoting either a general unbalance of bacterial metabolism in favour of \nmineralisation or/and a small contribution of the bacterial population for the total respiration. It is \ngenerally accepted, however, that in estuarine and coastal waters the respiration rates are mainly \ndetermined by the bacterial community (Grifith and Pomeroy, 1995) and that the importance of \nthis fraction declines with the distance to the coast (Hopkinson, et al., 1989). The separation of \nbacteria from the total community is not easy or exempt of criticism and was not attempted in this \nstudy. The values of the total community respiration in unfractionated samples may reflect the \nimportance of interbacterial DOC cycling as discussed by Yahnke and Craven (1995). \n\nThe ratio between primary production and bacterial biomass production at LT and HT \nreveals the intensity of the shifts towards autotrophy or heterotrophy in dependence of tide. \n\n\n\nCompartments of oxygen consumption  \n \n\n 28 \n\nAccording to our results, in a per volume basis, referring to late autumn and winter conditions \n(values not shown), the ratio at LT in the marine (1.0) and brackish water (2.1) zones \ncorresponded to a state of equilibrium between autotrophy and heterotrophy in the first zone and \nto a slight dominance of autotrophy in the upper estuary. At HT, however, this ratio shifted in \nopposite directions in the two zones. It increased to 3.3 in the marine zone (mainly due to the \ndecrease in bacterial biomass productivity) and decreased to 0.4 in the brackish water zone (due \nto the increase in bacterial biomass productivity and the decrease in primary productivity). \n\nIn a previous study of the Ria de Aveiro (Hoppe et al., 1996), during spring, this ratio was \nalways equal or greater than 4 (4 to 22) in the two zones, denoting the importance of primary \nproductivity in this season. According to these authors, at HT, the ratio exceeded the values at LT \nby a factor of 3 in the marine zone in a trend similar to that observed during the cold season. Also \nat HT, but in the brackish water zone, the trend was, however, reversed in relation to our results, \nshowing a 5 times increase in the ratio (due to an enormous increase in primary productivity not \nobserved in the cold season). \n\nDuring daylight, the shifts towards autotrophy and heterotrophy of the water column, in this \nestuarine system, are not only tide dependent but seem to be also season dependent. In the \nmarine zone, enhanced heterotrophy happened at LT particularly in the cold season. On the \ncontrary, in the same season, the upper estuary was mostly heterotrophic only at HT. \n\n \n \n\nAcknowledgments \n \n\nThe authors thank Prof. Klaus Gocke for helpfully advising on field and laboratory handling \nof the respiration chambers, Prof. Henrique Queiroga for drawing the map of the Ria de Aveiro, \nProf. Guillermo Marcano for producing the Spanish abstract and the divers of Anfibia, Lda for \ncollecting the sediments. \n\n \n \n\nReferences \n \nAlc\u00e2ntara, F., Cunha, A. and Ferreira, C. - 1996. \n\nMat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica e actividade enzim\u00e1tica \nextracelular em sedimentos estuarinos. \nProceedings of the 5th National Conference on \nthe Quality of the Environment.

A., Almeida, M. A. and Alc\u00e2ntara, F. (2000) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 204:1-12 \n\n \n_________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n \nAbstract - Bacterial heterotrophic communities play dominant roles in the transference of organic matter \nbetween compartments of estuarine ecosystems and, ultimately, between estuaries and the open sea. In this \nscenario, we investigated the responses of inflowing limnetic bacteria to the salinity gradient and the \ninfluence of this patterns on the degradation and recycling of organic matter in the Ria de Aveiro. \nPhytoplankton biomass was maximal (0.65-2.10 mgC l-1) in the mid- or inner-estuary and declined sharply at \nabout 30 PSU. Bacterial communities reached highest densities in the mid and inner sections of the estuary \n(up to 15.3 x109 cell l-1), being 2 -3 times higher than in the outer estuary at identical t idal conditions. \nThe rates of ectoenzymatic hydrolysis were also maximal at the mid -estuary or at the inner section. Values \nranged from 4.3 to 181.3 nmol l-1 h-1 for ? -glucosidase and from 490 to 5374 nmol l-1 h-1 for Leu-\naminopeptidase. At the transition from the limnetic environment to the main body of the lagoon an \nexceptional increase in the utilisation of carbohydrate was observed (? -glucosidase activity). This was \naccompanied by major amplifications of glucose incorporation with maximal values of 17.7 nmol l-1 h-1. Tr \nranged from 0.3 -4.1 % h-1 at the outer estuarine section increasing towards maximal values at the inner \nsection (10.4-39.4 % h -1). \nStatistical analysis revealed that the variation of ectoenzymatic activities could be significantly related to \nbacterial abundance, which, in turn, was highly associated to the variation of salinity, temperature and \nchlorophyll a. \nWithin the salinity gradient, the profiles of bacterial abundance, glucose uptake and ectoenzymatic activity \ngenerally agreed with a curvilinear pattern with a peak at about 25-30 PSU. Ectoenzymatic activity showed a \nquite conservative behaviour during tidal transport along the salinity gradient when compared to the more \nreactive parameters of glucose metabolism.  \n\n \n \n\nKey Words: Bacterioplankton; ectoenzymatic activity; heterotrophic activity; salinity \ngradient; estuaries \n \n \n1. Introduction \n \n\nEstuaries are transition systems governed by complex interacting elements that \nchange in space and with season. When subjected to tidal currents, the entire estuary \nacquires a pulsation that interferes with the transport and expression of biological activities \nand with the distribution of biomass in the water column. One can, however, assess the \n\n\n\nPatterns of heterotrophic activity  \n \n\n 34 \n\nmetabolic structure by locating the main sources of nutrients and of organic carbon and by \ndetermining the potential for autotrophic and heterotrophic growth as well as the potential \nof mineralisation. \n\nAllochthonous carbon sources, in accretion to the elevated primary production \ngenerally observed in estuaries, tend to enhance the heterotrophic component in the \nmetabolism of the plankton in disfavour of autotrophy. In different estuaries of the Iberian \nPeninsula, for example, it was observed that the external source of total organic carbon \n(TOC) was much larger tha n primary production (Vallespin\u00f3s and Mallo, 1990). \nMicroheterotrophs, especially bacteria, are the only biological populations capable of \nsignificantly altering both dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon \n(POC) (Chr\u00f3st, 1990) developing, in this way, a great impact in the cycle of matter and in \nthe energy flux. These processes require extensive extracellular substrate hydrolysis by \ndifferent ectoenzymes, activities that play a key role in microbial ecology (Hoppe, 1991, \nVetter et al., 1998). The importance of the ectoenzymatic activity is brought to evidence by \nthe coupling to the decomposition of POC and DOC during seasonal and spatial \nfluctuations of activity (Chr\u00f3st, 1990).  \n\nThe variation in ectohydrolase profiles (types and levels of activity) along an \nestuarine trophic gradient reflects the trophic status of the environment and this changes \nwith the season (Hoppe et al., 1998, Karner et al., 1992). It has been argued that such \nvariations could be caused by shifts in the dominant species or in the level of enzyme \nexpression by the same species in response to changes in the field of organic matter \n(Martinez et al., 1996) \n\nGenerally, the Ria de Aveiro, is dominated by microbial heterotrophic processes not \nonly in a diel scale, but probably all over the year (Hoppe et al., 1996). In the warm \nseason, during the daylight period, the balance between autotrophy and heterotrophy, \njudged from the ratio of primary production and bacterial production, shifted towards clear \nnet autotrophy, particularly at high tide (Hoppe et al., 1996). In the cold season, however, \neven during daylight, low tide only allowed a general equilibrium of the two activities in \nthe inner and outer estuary sections (Cunha et al., 1999).  \n\nIn face of the observed importance of heterotrophy in the lagoon of Aveiro, it is now \nattempted to put in evidence the patterns of degradation of major macromolecules and the \npatterns of turnover of monomers along the salinity gradient. The tidal effects on bacterial \nactivity will be explored in order to assess the conservative or reactive response of the \nsupporting metabolism during transport associated to tidal currents and to detect the \nlocation of the main activity sources in the estuary. \n\n\n\nPatterns of heterotrophic activity  \n \n\n 35 \n\n2. Materials and methods  \n \n\nStudy site \nThe Ria de Aveiro (Figure 1) is as a bar-\n\nbuilt estuary (Pritchard, 1967) on the Northwest \ncoast of Portugal separated from the sea by a \nsand barrier. The fresh water input to the lagoon \nduring the period of time equivalent to the flood \ntide varies throughout the year around an \naverage value of 1.8 Mm3, which is about 2 % \nof the total low tide volume of the lagoon \n(Silva, 1994). \n\nThe Ria is, in fact, a mesotidal coastal \nlagoon with a complex topography representing \na multi-estuarine ecosystem associated with \ndifferent inflowing rivers. Canal de Navega\u00e7\u00e3o \nis the main navigation channel and Rio Boco is \na small stream that continuously supplies \nfreshwater to the South end of Canal de \u00cdlhavo \n(Figure 1).  \n\nInvestigations were conducted along a \nlongitudinal profile, extending across the inner-\nestuary (River Boco) down to the outer segment \nof the lagoon, where 6 sampling sites spaced \nregularly at 3 Km were defined (Figure 1). The \nstations were numbered from north to south: \nstations N1 and I2 in Canal de Navega\u00e7\u00e3o; \nstations I4, I6 and I8 in Canal de \u00cdlhavo and RB \n(Rio Boco) RB at the mouth of a small \nfreshwater stream.  \n\nFor later comparisons, 3 segments were \nconsidered along this profile being a segment \ndefined as the distance over which a particle is \ntransported during flood tide (Silva, 1994). The \nouter-estuary (stations N1, I2), in the transition \n\nN\n\nN1\n\nI2\n\nI4\n\nI6\n\nI8 Rio Boco\n\nFigure 1: Ria de Aveiro (Portugal) with \nsampling stations indicated with arrows: \nStations N1 and I2 in Canal de Navega\u00e7\u00e3o, \nstations I4, I6 and I8 in Canal de \u00cdlhavo and \nstation Rio Boco at the mouth of the \nfreshwater stream. \n\n\n\nPatterns of heterotrophic activity  \n \n\n 36 \n\nto the coastal zone, showed salinities ranging from 33 to 35.5 PSU at high tide. The mid-\nestuary (stations I4, I6, I8) showed salinities in the 20-33 PSU range at the same tide. The \ninner-estuary (station RB) was defined as the mixing zone between the fresh and marine \nwaters with salinities, at high tide, below 20 PSU. \n\nThe main sources of contamination along this profile are waste waters from the city \nof Aveiro and pollution associated to harbour activities at the outer and mid segments, \nsome industries, aquaculture plants and diffuse domestic sewage drains at the mid segment \nand run-off from agriculture fields at the inner segment. \n\n \n \nSampling  \nThe six sampling sites were visited in early summer 1997, in neap tide (NT) (12th \n\nJuly) and spring tide (ST) (20th July) conditions. Samples were always collected during \ndaytime, an the centre of the channels, 0.2 m below the surface. Collection was performed \nat slack high (HT) and low (LT) tides using 5 l plastic bottles. Collected samples were kept \ncold and in the shade during transport to the laboratory where they were processed within \nthe next 2-3 hours. \n\n \n \nPhysical and chemical parameters  \nTemperature and salinity were measured with a WTW LF 196 Conductivity Meter. \n\nDissolved oxygen, expressed as the percentage of saturation, was determined with a WTW \nOXI 96 oxygen meter equipped with WTW BR 190 stirrer. Depth of the water column was \ndetermined with a Sonar probe and turbidity was evaluated with a Secchi disk. The \ndetermination of the concentration of suspended solids (seston) was performed after \nfiltration of 500 ml aliquots through Whatman GF/C (47 mm diameter) pre-weighted, pre-\ncombusted filters. The filters were dried at 60 \u00baC for 24 hours and seston content was \ncalculated as the increase in weight. Particulate organic matter (POM) was determined by \ndifference in the weight of the dry seston filters after 4 hours incineration at 525 \u00baC of the \ndry seston (Parsons et al., 1989). POC was calculated as 50 % of the POM (Rodier, 1996). \n\n \nMicrobiological parameters  \nTotal bacterial number (TBN) and bacterial organic carbon (BOC) were determined \n\nby cell counting under epifluorescence microscopy after fixation of the water samples with \n2 % formaldehyde (final concentration). The samples were filtered through 0.2 \u00b5m black \n\n\n\nPatterns of heterotrophic activity  \n \n\n 37 \n\npolycarbonate membranes (Poretics) and stained with 0.03 % acridine orange (Hobbie et \nal., 1977). On each filter 50 cells were measured with a reticule (Graticules, Ltd Model \nG2), placed in the microscope eyepiece, for the determination of the average cell volume. \nBacterial biomass was calculated from the averaged biovolume after conversion  \n(350 fgC \u00b5m-3 according to Bj\u00f8rnsen, 1986).  \n\nThe heterotrophic metabolism of glucose was described by the parameters Vm \n(maximum uptake velocity) and Tr (turnover rate) following the procedure described by \nGocke (1977). For Vm determinations, a final saturation concentration of 430 nM of  \n14C-glucose was added to 10 ml aliquots. For Tr, the final concentration of 14C-glucose was \n43 nM. Substrate concentrations were chosen after kinetic analysis. Incubations were \ncarried out for 2-3 hours at in situ temperature. Cells were collected on 0.2 \u00b5m Poretics \npolycarbonate membranes and radioactivity was read in a liquid scintillation counter \n(Beckman LS 6000 IC) using UniverSol as scintillation cocktail. Radioactive labelled \nglucose (SA 11.5 GBq mmol-1, 310 mCi mmol-1) was obtained from Amersham.  \n\nEctoenzymatic activity was determined fluorimetrically (Jasco FP-777 Fluorometer) \nas the maximum hydrolysis rate (Hm) of model substrates for ? -glucosidase (4-\nmethylumbelliferyl-? -D-glucoside) and Leu-aminopeptidase (L- leucine-7-amido-4-\nmethylcoumarin) added at the saturating concentration of 1 mM (Hoppe, 1983). \nWavelengths for excitation and emission were respectively 380-440 nm for MCA (7-\namino-4-methylcoumarone) and 360-450 nm for MUF (4- methylumbelliferone). \nMeasurements were made in 3 replicates for each sample after 1-2 hours incubations at in \nsitu temperature. Calibration was performed by adding a series of 6-8 concentrations of the \nfluorescent products (0-500 nM for MUF and 0-6 \u00b5M for MCA) to a pool of water from \nthe 6 sampling stations. \n\nChlorophyll a was determined fluorimetrically (Yentsch and Menzel, 1963) after \nextraction with 90% acetone. In the absence of a calculated factor for chlorophyll to carbon \nconversion, the generally accepted value of 50 (Eppley et al., 1977) was used. \n\n \n \nStatistical methods  \nAs an attempt to explain the variation of the microbiological parameters, stepwise \n\nmultiple regression was followed using chlorophyll a, seston, POM, percentage of POM in \nthe total seston, temperature, salinity, total depth, secchi depth and oxygen concentration as \nindependent variables. TBN was also included as independent variable for the regression \nanalysis of microbial activity parameters.  \n\n\n\nPatterns of heterotrophic activity  \n \n\n 38 \n\nStatistical procedures were performed with the SPSSWIN 7.1 package. \n \n \n3. Results \n \n\nPhysical and chemical parameters  \nPhysical and chemical data are shown in Table 1. Values of salinity ranged from  \n\n2.3 PSU at RB to 35.6 at station N1. The variation of salinity was strongest at the mouth of \nRB, with amplitude of 5.0 PSU in ST and 13.2 PSU in NT. \n\nThe temperature of the water column (Table 1) varied between 16.6 and 26.6 \u00baC \nincreasing towards the inner estuary. Water depth varied in the range of 0.3 to 8.6 m  \n(Table 1) with tide amplitudes of 0.5 to 2.6 m. \n\nDissolved oxygen concentration corresponded, in the minimum, to 76 % of the \nsaturation value (Table 1). In the mid- and inner-sections of the longitudinal profile, \nparticularly at LT in neap tide, oversaturation was frequent. \n\nSeston concentration ranged from 36 to 66 mg l-1 (Table 1) with no distinct \nlongitudinal pattern of variation. At HT, however, a considerable decrease in the amount of \nseston could be observed in the inner estuary, when compared to the downstream stations. \nNevertheless, values of Secchi depth remained quite low. In the outer and mid estuary the \nseston content at LT was up to 16 % greater than at HT. At the inner estuary the \ncorresponding increase was greater (37 or 44 %) denoting a richer particle content of the \ninflowing river. \n\nThe organic component of the seston (POC) varied between 5.5 and 7.5 mg l-1 \nremaining quite stable irrespectively of salinity or tide (Table 2). POC represented a \nfraction of 11-18 % of the seston at inner estuary and of 9-14 % at mid and outer estuary. \n\n \n\n \n\nPhytoplankton and bacterioplankton abundance \nThe highest concentrations of phytoplankton biomass (Table 2) were found at inner \n\nestuary (0.65-2.10 mgC l-1) or at mid estuary (0.44-1.82 mgC l-1). At outer estuary \nphytoplankton biomass ranged from 0.19 to 0.57 mgC l-1. The phytoplankton carbon \nfraction in the POC was also greater (1.9 to 9.3 times, average 4.3) in the inner- or the mid-\nestuary, depending on tide.  \n\n \n\n\n\nPatterns of heterotrophic activity  \n \n\n 39 \n\nTable 1: Values of total depth, Secchi depth, salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen and seston concentration \nregistered at the surface of the water column (0.2 m), at high and low tide under neap and spring tide \nconditions.

Discussion \n \n\nBacterial abundance and heterotrophic activity along the estuarine profile \nBacterial biomass and bacterial dependent activities were in agreement with a \n\ncurvilinear pattern with a peak at about 25-30 PSU. This corresponds, in general, to the \nestuarine structure described by Wright and Coffin (1983), Palumbo et al. (1984), Fuks et \nal. (1991) and Bordalo et al. (1998) but the location of the peak in Canal de \u00cdlhavo was \nshifted to a comparatively higher salinity level because of the low fresh water input. The \nRia contrasts with other estuaries that showed maximal values for bacterial heterotrophic \nactivities in the inner estuary, at low salinity values (3-10 PSU), followed by a \nconservative decrease towards higher salinities (Palumbo and Ferguson, 1978). In the \nparticular situation of the Ria de Aveiro, it seems clear that the freshwater stream, at the \ninner part of the studied estuarine profile (Figure 1) is generally less polluted than the \nlagoon itself and has higher chlorophyll concentrations but lower seston content, bacterial \nabundance and rates of ectoenzymatic protein degradation. The peaks of bacterial \n\n\n\nPatterns of heterotrophic activity  \n \n\n 44 \n\nabundance, Leu-AMPase activity and glucose heterotrophic metabolism, accompanied by \ndenser (2-4 times) phytoplankton communities and increased nitrate concentrations (data \nnot shown), usually occurred at station I8 and were pushed up to RB only with the strong \nflood tide currents, under spring tide conditions. \n\nValues of TBN, ? -GLCase activity and glucose Tr obtained during this study \ngenerally fit within the range of values published for the Ria de Aveiro and for other \ntemperate coastal ecosystems (Rheinheimer et al., 1989, Chr\u00f3st and Veliminov, 1991, Fuks \net al., 1991, Karner et al., 1992, Crump and Baross, 1996, Hoppe et al., 1996, Hoppe et al., \n1998). However, the metabolism of glucose along the studied profile was strongly diverted \nto incorporation in bacterial biomass (72.5-98.0 %) rather than to respiration. Higher \ngrowth efficiencies of estuarine bacteria, when compared to open-water communities, have \nbeen reported by J\u00f8rgensen et al. (1999). The authors postulate that the differences are \nrelated to the quality (lability) of the available organic matter. Our values are higher than \nthe range of values for estuarine environments (11 to 61 %) reviewed by del Giorgio and \nCole (1998). However, it must be taken into consideration that the single radiotracer \napproach may produce artificially high values of the incorporated fraction because the \nequilibrium of the intracellular pool is not completely achieved during the short incubation \nperiods (Yahnke and Craven, 1995). \n\nThe extracellular degradation of protein was also exceptionally high along the \nsalinity gradient. Leu-AMPase Hm varied in the high range of 490 to 5374 nmol l-1 h-1, \ngreatly exceeding a previous range of values (8.3 to 311 nmol l-1 h-1, after conversion) \ndetermined in a less rich region of the Ria de Aveiro (Hoppe et al., 1996). It exceeded also \nthe range of other published results (4 to 2540 nmol l-1 h-1) for brackish water systems \n(Chr\u00f3st and Velimirov, 1991, Hoppe, 1983, Hoppe et al., 1996, Hoppe et al., 1998, Rego \net al., 1985) denoting an exceptional high potential for peptide hydrolysis in the mid \nestuary of the studied profile. This is probably related to intense anthropogenic pressure \nand increased eutrophication of the brackish water sections of the lagoon. \n\n \n \nChanging pattern of organic matter utilisation between the fresh water stream \n\nand the main body of the lagoon \nOne of the most interesting aspects in the variation of bacterial abundance and \n\nactivity along this estuarine profile is the transition between the inner station (Rio Boco) \nand the main body of the lagoon. The gradient of enrichment in bacterial abundance and \nactivity, from the mouth to the inner parts of the lagoon, extends to the river only under \n\n\n\nPatterns of heterotrophic activity  \n \n\n 45 \n\nspring tide conditions, when strong flood tide currents push up a considerable amount of \nestuarine water. Under different conditions, bacterial abundance decreases at the inner \nstation, as well as Leu-AMPase activity, contrasting with an increase of ? -GLCase activity. \nThis seems to locate upstream the main source of bacterial potential for the degradation of \ncarbohydrates and in the main body of the lagoon the major sources of bacterial carbon and \nAMPase activity. The LT/HT ratios for ? -GLCase activity at RB were above or, at least, \nclose to 1 (Table 5), as occurred at the mid and outer sections.

LT/HT ratios greater than 1 should be expected for other \nparameters related to glucose metabolism (Glucose Vm and Tr) but at RB, the LT \nstimulation of glucose metabolism was only obvious in spring tide (Table 5). The intense \nmixture with water from the mid section of the estuary during ST worked as a \nreinforcement of the supply of simple molecules and allowed the intensification of glucose \nmetabolism at LT, when the negative effect of salinity was reduced.  \n\nIn terms of specific activities, ectoenzymatic activities exhibited distinct tidal \nresponses. Specific values of ? -GLCase Hm (and glucose uptake Vm) showed, at RB, \nhigher values at LT while, on the contrary, specific AMPase Hm at RB was higher at HT. \nHowever, it must be considered that cell specific activity is a statistical concept that may \nnot represent the whole reality of a changing bacterial community in an unstable \nenvironment, since it can alternatively reflect an intrinsic difference in the composition \n(Martinez et al., 1996) or/and in the activity of marine and estuarine bacterial communities \n(Karner et al., 1992).  \n\nFresh water residence time at the inner section of Canal de \u00cdlhavo ranges from 6 days \nin spring to several weeks during periods of low freshwater input (Silva, 1994). In these \nconditions, bacterial communities that reach the uppermost sections of the estuary may \nremain in the brackish water sections during considerable periods. This allows us to \nhypothesise that the shift in the patterns of heterotrophic utilisation of protein and \ncarbohydrates reflects the existence of distinct microbial communities adapted to the \ndifferent environmental conditions and nutrient sources. The observed longitudinal pattern \nwould then result from the combined contributions of a riverine reservoir of potential for \ncarbohydrate degradation and an estuarine reservoir of bacterial biomass and potential for \nprotein utilisation. \n\n \n \nReactive versus conservative bacterial heterotrophic capacities \nDuring the relatively slow transport from the inner sections, processes of mixing of \n\ncommunities, dilution with poorer seawater and adaptation to different organic substrates \nwill considerably change the characteristics of bacterioplankton that reaches the mouth of \nthe lagoon. Some parameters showed a quite conservative behaviour during tidal transport \nwhile others, more reactive, were distinctly shifted up and down, resulting in changes in \nthe slope of the profile established along the salinity gradient. These changes can be easily \n\n\n\nPatterns of heterotrophic activity  \n \n\n 47 \n\ncompared by the ratios between the values observed at stations I8 and N1 (I8 versus N1) \nfor different tidal conditions (Figure 3).  \n\nTBN 4.3\nPhytoplankton-C 4.8\n\nShift up Glucose Vm 1.6\nGlucose Tr 3.2\nLeu-AMPase Hm 3.1\nGLCase Hm 3.2\n\nHT 34.7-35-6 33.0-29.0 7.3\nNeap tide\n\nLT 32.7-32.6 30.0-24.6 2.3\n\nTBN 3.2\nPhytoplankton-C 3.6\n\nShift down Glucose Vm 5.7\nGlucose Tr 8.9\nLeu-AMPase Hm 2.5\nGLCase Hm 2.4\n\nTBN 2.6\nPhytoplankton-C 3.4\n\nShift up Glucose Vm -\nGlucose Tr 6.2\nLeu-AMPase Hm 4.5\nGLCase Hm 3.4\n\nHT 35.5 34.4-33.2 17.7\nSpring tide\n\nLT 33.5-33.3 30.2-25.2 4.5\n\nTBN 2.1\nPhytoplankton-C 1.7\n\nShift down Glucose Vm 15.1\nGlucose Tr 18.1\nLeu-AMPase Hm 2.2\nGLCase Hm 3.3\n\nFigure 3: Schematic representation of tidal responses (shift up and shift down) of biological parameters. \nValues inside the gre y boxes indicate the ranges of salinity values in each one of the three segments of \nCanal de \u00cdlhavo. Inside the dotted-line boxes are presented the ratios calculated between the values \nregistered at stations I8 and N1 (I8/N1) for TBN, phytoplankton-C, and bacterial activity parameters, under \ndifferent tidal conditions. \n \n\n\n\nPatterns of heterotrophic activity  \n \n\n 48 \n\nAs a general trend, bacterial abundance and activity increased inwards during flood \ntide transport (HT shift up) and decreased during ebbing (LT shift down) as a combined \neffect of dilution by poorer marine water and mixture of communities with different \nspecific activity rates. For the overall of the parameters, ST results in an increase in the \nslope of the longitudinal profile but the most striking feature is the distinct behaviour of \nectoenzymes when compared to the heterotrophic metabolism of glucose. Both \nectoenzymes seemed to be transported/diluted up and down the estuary maintaining a quite \ngood balance between shifting up at HT (I8/N1 ratios of 2.2-4.5) and shifting down at LT \n(I8/N1 ratios of 2.2-3.3). On the contrary, the negative effects of increasing salinity and \nimpoverishment, associated to ebb tide transport, on glucose metabolism (Vm and Tr) were \nstronger than the stimulation of marine communities being transported to a richer \nenvironment. The  I8/N1 ratios for Vm and Tr of glucose were higher at LT (5.7-18.1) than \nthe corresponding values calculated for HT (1.6-6.2). This reinforces the scenery of a \nlimnetic source of carbohydrate-utilising bacterial communities. \n\nThe steepest trophic gradient, evaluated by the I8/N1 ratios of phytoplankton \nbiomass (4.8) and bacterial abundance (4.3), occurred at HT-NT. However, in the same \nconditions, the corresponding ratios for glucose Vm and Tr were only 1.6 and 3.2, \nrespectively. This means that at HT-NT, bacterial abundance was more shifted up than the \nmetabolism of glucose and explains the decrease in specific activity from the outer to the \ninner sections (Table 3). If, in this case, resuspension was related to the increase in \nbacterial abundance then, newly suspended benthic bacterial communities were \ncharacterised by lower specific activity rates.  \n\nThe results of multiple regression analysis (Table 4) help clarifying the distinct \nbehaviour of different heterotrophic capacities during tidal transport. A close relation \nbetween ectoenzymatic activity and bacterial abundance can be confirmed. More than  \n80 % of the variation of bacterial abundance was associated to the combined effects of \nsalinity, temperature and chlorophyll a concentration. The relation with salinity is, \nhowever, strongly influenced by the contrast between Rio Boco and the brackish water \nstations. A similar statistical treatment excluding the RB produces a clear negative relation \nbetween bacterial abundance and salinity (results not shown). \n\nAn important fraction (>80 %) the variation in Leu-AMPase activity could be \nexplained by the variation of TBN suggesting that this ectohydrolytic capacity is common \nand a widespread characteristic of estuarine bacterioplankton. Since it is closely associated \nto bacterial cells, processes of mixing and dilution mainly control the variation of Leu-\nAMPase activity during tidal transport. In the case of ? -GLCase, the two variables TNB \n\n\n\nPatterns of heterotrophic activity  \n \n\n 49 \n\nand salinity explained 82 % of the variation, denoting an increase in salinity effects in \nrelation to Leu-AMPase. \n\nThe variation of temperature alone could not explain more than 30-40% of the \nvariation in glucose Vm and Tr suggesting the greater importance of other variables, like \nthe size and quality of the dissolved organic matter pool, and justifies the reactivity of \nthese parameters during tidal transport. It has been reported that, in aquatic ecosystems, the \nconcentration of dissolved polymers in DOC is usually at least one order of magnitude \nhigher than the particulate fraction (Zdanowski and Figueiras 1997). Results from Murrel \nat al. (1999) indicate that during the warm season, when flux of fresh water and the supply \nof particles to the estuaries are reduced, seston suffers from low nutritional quality. We \nbelieve that in the ma in body of the Ria de Aveiro, like in other estuarine environments, \n(Azam and Hodson, 1977, Williams, 1981, Ducklow, 1983, Murrell et al., 1999) bacteria \nobtain their organic carbon mainly from the flux of DOC rather than from the \ndecomposition of essentially detrital POM. The shift from the utilisation of complex \nsubstrates, eventually associated to high-quality seston at RB, to the increasing importance \nof simple dissolved substrates as nutrient sources, at the brackish water sections of the \nestuary, may contribute to the high reactivity of parameters related to the incorporation of \nmonomers. \n\n \n \n\n5. Conclusions  \n \nThe profiles of variation of abundance and activity along an estuarine profile in the \n\nRia de Aveiro, revealed a shifting from a more N-associated metabolism at the main body \nof the lagoon to an increase of the importance of the C-utilising community at the mouth of \nthe fresh water stream Rio Boco. Ectoenzymatic activity followed more closely the \nvariation of bacterial abundance than monomer uptake and seemed to be mainly \ndetermined by the variation of salinity, temperature and phytoplankton biomass. However, \nthe activity of ? -GLCase was strongly associated to the interface with the limnetic \nenvironment being negatively affected by increasing salinity.  \n\nAlong the profile, and under different tidal conditions, ectoenzymatic activity \nappeared to be transported up (stimulated) or down (depressed) the estuary, following a \nquite conservative pattern and responding probably mainly to dilutions effects associated \nto the entrance of poorer marine water during flood tide. The heterotrophic metabolism of \nglucose showed a more reactive behaviour. This parameter responded negatively to the \n\n\n\nPatterns of heterotrophic activity  \n \n\n 50 \n\nebb-tide transport. On the contrary, during transport to inner stations of the lagoon there \nwas a comparably less pronounced and, in some degree, more reversible stimulation. We \ndid not attempt to characterise the dissolved organic matter that reaches the brackish water \nsection of the lagoon mainly from allochtonous origins. However, ectoenzymatic activity \ncould be limiting the turnover of monomers, at least at the inner section of the studied \nprofile. The shifting to a more carbohydrate- utilising bacterial community at the limnetic \nend of the estuary points to an increased importance of autotrophic processes as a source of \nsubstrates during the warm season and in the day light period. \n\n \n \n\nReferences \n \n\nAzam F and Hodson RE (1977) Size distribution \nand activity of marine microheterotrophs. \nLimnol Oceanogr  22:492 -501 \n\nBj\u00f8rnsen PK (1986) Automatic determination of \nbiomass by image analysis.

The opposite transference of the brackish-water bacterial \ncommunity to marine water produced maximal decreases to 0.14-0.58 % of the control values.  \nIn a reverse experiment, designed as the return to the initial conditions after 2 hours of the first exposure, the \nmarine community rapidly re -acquired the characteristic low levels of activity. Contrastingly, the negative \neffects of 2 hours of exposure to marine water on the activity of the brackish water bacteria persisted, at least \nfor 4 hours, after return to their natural water. \nThe apparent short -term irreversibility of the decline in activity of the brackish water bacteria when exposed \nto marine water, in parallel with the quick and reversible positive response of the marine water bacteria to the \nbrackish water, suggests the development of two distinct bacterioplankton communities adapted to the \nenvironmental conditions prevailing at distinct sections of the estuary. The reactivity to environmental \nchanges demonstrated by the two communities allows the prediction of estuarine profiles of bacterial activity \nsteeper than those expected from the conservative transport of bacterial cells associated with tidal currents. \n\n \n \n1. Introduction \n\n \nEstuarine bacterioplankton communities develop and evolve under unstable \n\nenvironmental conditions. Along estuarine gradients, marine and fluvial influences may \ncombine to produce different patterns of bacterial abundance and heterotrophic activity. \nDenser and more active bacterioplankton communities may occur at intermediate salinities \n?5, 12, 26, 38? frequently associated with the maximum turbidity zone. However, under the \nparticular environmental and morphological characteristics of an estuarine system, peaks \nof abundance and activity may be found at low salinity values (3-10 PSU), followed by \nconservative decrease towards higher salinity sections ?25?; contrastingly, maximum \n\n\n\nShort-time responses to changing water properties  \n \n\n 54 \n\nactivity may occur at the outer estuary ?6?. Generally, at low salinity levels \nbacterioplankton communities exhibit higher growth efficiencies ?14, 20? and express \nrelatively higher rates of ? -glucosidase activity ?24?. On the contrary, closer to the \ninterface with the sea, bacterioplankton seems to be more adapted to the degradation of \nprotein ?24?. \n\nConsiderable work has been developed in attempts to determine the environmental \nfactors controlling the activity profiles of estuarine bacterioplankton. The availability of \ninorganic nutrients ?37? and the quantity and quality (lability) of the pool of organic matter \nmay exert control over the production of bacterial biomass ?14, 21?, growth yield ?3, 20?, \nectoenzymatic activity ?24? and monomer uptake ?8?. Processes involving longitudinal \ntransport of particles along the estuary and exchange of materials between the sediments \nand the water column may ultimately modify the quality of the substrates available for \nbacterial utilisation. In ecosystems where rivers are responsible for the major inputs of \nparticles, there is a decrease in the quality of particulate organic carbon (POC) from the \ninner sections to the mouth of the estuary and a corresponding decrease in bacterial \nheterotrophic activity ?24?. Closer to the riverine source of rich particulate substrates, \nbacterial activity was frequently found to be uncoupled from primary production since the \nin situ supply of organic substrates was not acting as a limiting factor ?32?. It has also been \ndemonstrated that fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the sediments may \nstimulate bacterial biomass production ?23? and increase growth rates ?16?. The impact of \nthe release of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the sediments on bacterial activity in \nthe water column can be more important in shallow areas, particularly those with fine \nsediments and high rates of benthic primary production ?23?. \n\nThe dynamics of bacterial carbon metabolism respond to the shifting properties of \nthe water column between different sections of an estuary ?31?. One question about the \nestablishment of patterned estuarine gradients of bacterial activity is whether these \ngradients reflect reversible responses of versatile communities and/or processes of mixing \nof communities adapted to different prevailing environmental conditions and nutrient \nsources along this gradient. Another question is: do these responses occur over a time scale \nthat can allow observable effects during ebb and flood tides? \n\nTo answer these questions and to predict the effects of changing estuarine \nhydrodynamics, an experimental set-up was devised to challenge bacterioplankton \npopulations, from the outer and mid estuary, to respond to contrasting estuarine water. This \nwork reports on the short-term changes in heterotrophic bacterial activity. \n\n \n\n\n\nShort-time responses to changing water properties  \n \n\n 55 \n\n2. Methods  \n \nStudy site \nThe Ria de Aveiro (Fig. 1) is a branched \n\nestuarine ecosystem in the Northwest coast of \nPortugal with maximum length and width of 45 \nand 10 Km, respectively. The tidal water \nexchange with the ocean is about 89 Mm3 while \nthe average fresh water input during an \nequivalent period of time is, on average,  \n1.8 Mm3 ?33?. The ecosystem is frequently \ndescribed as a coastal lagoon within which is \ndistinguished a deeper marine zone (10 to  \n>20 m deep at high tide) encompassing  \n22-35 % of the total water volume of the Ria \n?33? and a progressively shallower brackish \nwater zone, branched in several channels along \nwhich salinity gradients develop. For this study, \n2 sampling stations were chosen in order to \nrepresent contrasting water characteristics \nwithin the estuary: station N1 in Canal de \nNavega\u00e7\u00e3o, close to the mouth of the lagoon, \nrepresenting the deep marine zone, and station \nI6 in Canal de \u00cdlhavo, representing the shallow \ninner brackish water zone. \n\n \n \nSampling  \nThe sampling sites and the moment of \n\ncollection in relation to the tidal cycle were \nchosen in order to represent sharp contrasting \nenvironmental conditions within the estuary. \nStation N1 was sampled 2 hours before high tide \n(HT). As the volume of water that enters this \nsection during flood tide (89 Mm3) is much \n\nFig. 1: Ria de Aveiro lagoon (Portugal) with \nsampling stations indicated by arrows: station \nN1 in Canal de Navega\u00e7\u00e3o, 1.5 Km from the \nmouth, and station I6 in Canal de \u00cdlhavo, 9 \nKm from the mouth. \n\nN\n\nN1\n\nI6\n\n\n\nShort-time responses to changing water properties  \n \n\n 56 \n\nlarger than the 31 mM3 that remain at lo w tide [33], we assumed that the samples obtained \nwhen ocean water was in full flow into the estuary would fairly represent marine \nenvironmental conditions and the corresponding bacterioplankton communities. At station \nI6 sampling was performed late in the ebb flux, 2 hours before low tide (LT). It was \nassumed that in these samples, the characteristics of the water and of the bacterioplankton \ncommunities of the mid section of the estuary would be fairly represented. \n\nStations N1 and I6 were visited in February, March and June 1998. A total volume \nof 60 l of water was collected from 0.2 m below the surface, by consecutive immersions of \na 10 l plastic bottle. Samples were transported to the laboratory in 100 l dark plastic \ncontainers.  \n\n \n \nWater quality variables \nThe physical, chemical and microbiological characteristics of the marine and \n\nbrackish water samples were determined within 6 hours after collection. \nSalinity was measured with a conductivity meter (WTW \u2013 Wissenschaftlich \n\nTechnische Werkst\u00e4tten, Model LF 196). The determination of the concentration of \nsuspended solids (seston) was performed after filtration of 500 ml aliquots through \nWhatman GF/C (47 mm diameter) pre-weighted, pre-combusted filters. The filters were \ndried at 60 \u00baC for 24 hours and the seston content was calculated as the increase in weight. \nThe loss of weight by ignition, as a measure of the particulate organic matter content \n(POM), was achieved by 4 hours of incineration of dry seston at 525 \u00baC ?27?. POC was \ncalculated as 50 % of the POM ?30?. Chlorophyll a concentrations were determined \nfluorimetrically ?39? after extraction with 90 % acetone. \n\nIn the February samples the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and \ninorganic nutrients were also determined. Samples for DOC analyses were filtered through \npre-combusted Whatman GF/C filters and kept frozen (-20\u00baC). An independent laboratory \n(Ambio, Ltd) carried out DOC determinations by combustion and infrared detection ?2? in \na Dohrman DC-180 Analyser. For nutrient analyses, 25 ml aliquots were filtered through \ncellulose acetate membranes with a pore size of 0.45 \u00b5m (MSI - Micron Separation Inc.) \nand stored at \u201320 \u00baC until analysis. The concentration of NO3\n\n- + NO2\n- was determined by \n\nthe sulfanilic acid method after the reduction of NO3\n- to NO2\n\n- in a cadmium column. The \nanalysis of PO4\n\n3- followed the molybdate method. For these determinations, the standard \nprocedures for nutrient analyses ?35? were adapted to the Segmented Flow Injection \nAutomatic Analyser, Alliance Instruments, France \u2013 Evolution II ?1?. \n\n\n\nShort-time responses to changing water properties  \n \n\n 57 \n\nBacterioplankton parameters  \nTotal bacterial number (TBN) was determined by direct counting under \n\nepifluorescence microscopy after fixation of the water samples with 2 % formaldehyde \n(final concentration), followed by collection of cells on 0.2 \u00b5m black polycarbonate \nmembranes (Poretics) and staining with 0.03% acridine orange ?15?. \n\nEctoenzymatic activity was determined fluorimetrically (Jasco FP-777 \nFluorometer) as the maximum hydrolysis rate (Hm) of two model substrates,  \n4-methylumbelliferyl-? -D-glucoside for for ? -glucosidase (? -GLCase) and L- leucine-7-\namido-4-methyl-coumarin for Leu-aminopeptidase, (Leu-AMPase) ?17?, at a saturating \nconcentration of 1 mM. For each sample, 3 replicates were analysed. Wavelengths for \nexcitation and emission were respectively 380-440 nm for MCA (7-amino-4-\nmethylcoumarone) and 360-450 nm for MUF (4- methylumbelliferone). The incubation \nperiod varied between 1 and 2 hours and took place at a standard temperature of 20\u00ba C. \nFluorescent substrates and standards were purchased from Sigma Co. \n\nGlucose incorporation (Glucose Vm) ?13? was determined in 3 replicates and one \nblank fixed with 2 % formaline at a final saturation concentration of 430 nM of  \n14C-glucose (Amersham, SA 11.5 GBq mmol-1, 310 mCi mmol-1). Incubations were carried \nout for 2 hours at 20\u00baC. Cells were collected on 0.2 \u00b5m Poretics polycarbonate membranes \nand radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter Beckman LS 6000 IC using \nUniverSol (ICN Biomedicals, USA) as the scintillation cocktail. \n\nBacterial biomass productivity (BBP) was determined according to Simon and \nAzam ?34? in 10 ml aliquots (3 replicates and one blank fixed with 2 % formaline) by the \nincorporation of 3H- leucine (Amersham, SA 61 Ci mmol-1) at a final concentration of  \n30 nM. Incubation took place at 20 \u00baC for 1 hour. Cells were harvested on 0.2 \u00b5m Poretics \npolycarbonate membranes and washed with 10 ml cold 10 % TCA. Radioactivity was read \nin a liquid scintillation counter Beckman LS 6000 IC using UniverSol as the scintillation \ncocktail.  \n \n \n\nTime course of bacterioplankton response during exposure to contrasting \nwater quality \n\nTwo experimental incubation systems were prepared (Fig. 2). Each one consisted of \na stirred water bath with a capacity of 20 l completely filled either with water from station \nN1 (N1 tank representing the marine zone of the estuary) or from station I6 (I6 tank \nrepresenting the brackish water of the mid estuary). Temperature was kept at 20 \u00baC. Each \n\n\n\nShort-time responses to changing water properties  \n \n\n 58 \n\ndiffusion chamber, with a capacity of 170 ml, consisted of a hollow nylon cylinder with an \nexternal height of 4.5 cm closed at the tops with two 12.5 cm diameter polycarbonate \nmembranes (Poretics, 0.2 \u00b5m). The membranes were held in place by Viton\u00ae \nfluoroelastomer o-rings attached to nylon frames, tightly screwed to the cylinder. A neck \nand an opening at the middle of the chamber allowed the initial filling and periodic \nsampling. The sampling port was kept closed during immersion by a silicone-rubber \nstopper covered by a screw cap ?28?.  \n\n \n  \n\n \n\nN1 \nwater \n\nN1 \n \n\nI6 \n\nDiffusion chamber  \n\nBuoy \n\nMARINE ZONE CONDITIONS \n\nStirring \n\n \n\n \n\nI6 \nwater \n\nN1 \n \n\nI6 \n\nBRACKISH WATER CONDITIONS \n\nStirring \n\n \nFig. 2: Schematic representation of the experimental set up: stirred water baths were filled with water from \nstation N1 (marine conditions) or station I6 (brackish water conditions) and diffusion chambers (tests and \ncontrols), prepared as described in the text, were immersed hanging from buoys. \n\n \nOne \u201cblank\u201d chamber, filled with the same water as that in each water bath, was \n\nused to assess the dilution effect on bacterial abundance and total bacterial activity \n(entrance of water due to the reduction of pressure inside the chambers associated to the \ndecrease in volume after repeated sampling). Further testing allowed us to assume that the \nwater was entering the chamber only through the surface of the membrane and not through \nthe top opening or through the junctions of the membrane to the body of the chamber \n(transport of bacterial cells was not observed). \n\nTwo sets of 7 diffusion chambers were completely filled with water either from N1 \nor from I6. The marine N1 tank received four N1 chambers (1 blank + 3 controls) and three \nI6 chambers (3 tests). In the brackish water incubation system the set-up involved four \n\n\n\nShort-time responses to changing water properties  \n \n\n 59 \n\nchambers with I6 water (1 blank + 3 controls) and three chambers with N1 water (3 tests). \nAll the chambers were kept completely immersed, and in an upright position (with the cap \njust surfacing) with the help of individual buoys. Time recording was initiated at the \nmoment of immersion. Test samples were exposed to contrasting water characteristics for a \nmaximum of 6 hours, corresponding approximately to the duration of one half of a tidal \ncycle. After 2 and 4 hours, chambers were emerged and a volume of 30 ml of water was \ncollected from each chamber with the help of a silicone tube connected to a plastic syringe. \nThe three N1 test or control sub-samples and the three I6 test or control sub-samples were \npooled to obtain the volume of sample necessary for the determinations of all variables. \nThe blank chamber in each incubation system was also emerged after 2 and 4 hour and the \ntotal volume of water inside the chamber was measured. From this volume, an aliquot of \n30 ml was withdrawn in order to approach the conditions in the test and control chambers. \nThe remaining volume of water was again inserted in the blank chamber that was then \nimmersed back into the respective tank. At the end of the exposure period, the volumes of \nwater remaining inside the blank, control and test chambers were measured. \n\nThe assessment of the variation of bacterial abundance and activity during the \nperiod of exposure, was performed through the determination of ectoenzymatic activities \n(leucine-aminopeptidase and ? -glucosidase), Vm of glucose incorporation, and bacterial \nbiomass production after 2, 4 and 6 hours of incubation. TBN was also determined at the \nsame time intervals with exception of the February experiment, when TBN was determined \nonly at the beginning and at the end of the experiment. The methodologies involved were \ndescribed above. \n\n \n \nReversion of exposure  \nIn one of the experiments (June 1998), an attempt was made to observe the effects \n\nof reverting the marine and brackish water bacteria to the approximate conditions of their \nnatural environment after 2 hours of exposure to contrasting water. For this purpose, one \nextra set of 3 test chambers was included in each tank during the first 2 hours and then \ntransferred to the tank containing water of the same origin, where incubation continued for \na further 4 hours period. The chambers to test reversion effects were also sampled after 2, 4 \nand 6 hours of exposure. \n \n \n \n\n\n\nShort-time responses to changing water properties  \n \n\n 60 \n\n3. Results \n \nInitial characterisation of marine and brackish water samples \nThe values corresponding to the initial properties of the marine (station N1) and \n\nbrackish water (station I6) sections of the lagoon are summarised in Table 1. \nBrackish water showed low or medium salinity and higher concentration of POC \n\nand chlorophyll a. The largest differences in salinity, seston and POC between the two \nsamples were observed in February. On that occasion nutrients and DOC were also \nanalysed. The results confirmed the higher availability of organic and inorganic nutrients \nin the brackish water samples, particularly nitrite plus nitrate (increase by a factor of 17). \n\n \nTable 1: Initial physical, chemical and biological properties of the N1 and I6 water samples used in the \nreciprocal exposure experiments.

The variation in the concentration of NO2\n-+NO3\n\n- and PO4\n3- (Fig. 4) indicates \n\nthat concentrations of dissolved substances followed a pattern similar to that of salinity. \nThus, there was effective percolation of water and solutes through the membranes. \n\nMicrobiological variables responded quickly to exposure to the contrasting water \n(Fig. 5). Usually, after only 2 hours, there was a decrease in the activity of the brackish \nwater bacterioplankton incubated in outer-estuary water, and an increase in the activity of \nthe outer-estuary bacterial community incubated in brackish water, relative to the control \nvalues.  \n\nThe amplitude of positive or negative effects was different between experiments \nand between different variables. In general, however, the absolute magnitudes of the \npositive and ne gative effects were similar. Ectoenzymatic activities seemed to be less \naffected by the shifting of environmental properties. Response coefficients, calculated as \nthe ratios between the values determined in the test and in the corresponding control \npopulations (Fig. 6), indicated lower intensity of the responses of Leu-AMPase Hm (0.49-\n2.41) and ? -GLCase Hm (0.58-2.53) than those of glucose Vm and BBP (response \n\ncoefficients of 0.14-3.84 and 0.21-2.90, \nrespectively). In the February experiment, \nectoenzymatic activities showed particularly \nweek responses. The values of the response \ncoefficient were 0.8-1.2 for Leu-AMPase Hm \nand 0.7-1.3 for ? -GLCase Hm.

I6 test) \n\n\n\nShort-time responses to changing water properties  \n \n\n 66 \n\nfact that underlies the responses observed in these experiments. The concentrations of \nseston and POC were 1.2-2.0 times higher in I6 than in N1, reflecting different inputs of \nparticles from the fresh water stream Rio Boco, at the southeastern end of Canal de \u00cdlhavo, \nlocal discharges along the channel and eventual resuspension of bottom sediments. \nRegardless of some patchiness, sediments from stations N1 and I6 correspond dominantly \nto medium sand. They differ, however, in the organic content which was estimated as \n 2.9 % of the dry weight at I6 and 0.8 % at N1 [9]. Higher chlorophyll concentrations give \nthe indication of greater eutrophication in the mid sections of the estuary, also associated \nwith exceptionally high concentrations of NO2\n\n- + NO3\n- (17 times higher than at station N1). \n\nPrimary production at the brackish water section was estimated as  \n3.31 \u00b5gC l-1 h-1 at LT while the HT value closer to the mouth was 0.13 \u00b5gC l-1 h-1 \n\n(Almeida, unpublished data). I6 water seemed to have a slightly better quality of \nparticulate substrates. Assuming the conversion factor of 50 [11], phytoplankton-C \nrepresented 1.7-4.4 % of the total POC at station N1 and 2.2-5.3 % at station I6. The \nresults of the February experiment also showed higher concentrations of dissolved organic \nsubstrates in I6 water. \n\nThe bacterioplankton communities, which were contrasted in our study, differed \nless in density than in activity, at the beginning of the experiments. The bacterial \ncommunities found at mid-estuary during LT were denser and more active than those from \nstation N1. The ratios derived from the initial values of the two communities (I6/N1) were \n1.3-1.7 for TBN, 2.0-5.2 for Leu-AMPase, 2.2-4.2 for ? -GLCase, 2.2-4.2 for glucose Vm \nand 2.0-10.8 for BBP.  Higher rates of total plankton respiration at the brackish water \nsection of the Ria de Aveiro had already been reported [9]. When specific activities were \ncalculated they revealed that the average brackish water bacterial cell was 1.1 to 8.4 times \nmore active than its marine counterpart. Changes in specific activity have been reported as \nreflecting an intrinsic difference in the composition [22] and/or in the activity of marine \nand estuarine bacterial communities [21], which could, in this case, be an indication of the \npresence of communities adapted to different nutritional environments along the estuarine \ngradient. It has been shown that the experimental addition of protein to estuarine \nbacterioplankton communities produced, within 1-4 days, considerable changes in the \ncomposition of the community, in terms of the relative importance of particular \nphylogenetic groups, as well as the increase in growth rate [29]. The long residence time of \nfresh water estimated for the eutrophic mid section of Canal de \u00cdlhavo (10.1-97.4 days) \n[33] would be compatible with strong changes in the composition of bacterial communities \nwhich could also be expressed by different responses to variation in salinity and nutrient \n\n\n\nShort-time responses to changing water properties  \n \n\n 67 \n\nsupply.  \nThe values of abundance and activity determined for the two bacterial communities \n\nfit within the ranges published for other highly productive coastal systems [4, 12, 17, 18, \n19]. High potential for protein degradation (Leu-AMPase) has been found in previous \nwork in the Ria de Aveiro [10]. \n\nThe primary question regarding the existence of distinct bacterial communities in \ndifferent sections of the estuary was addressed by characterising the effects of the \nreciprocal swapping between contrasting conditions in terms of response time, intensity \nand reversibility. \n\nBoth communities responded rapidly, within the initial 2-4 hours of exposure. \nSamples from the same sites amended with simple (glucose, mixture of 10 amino acids, \ncomplex B vitamins) and complex (yeast extract, commercial algae exudates) organic \nsubstrates in microcosm experiments showed significant variations of activity within 6 \nhours of incubation, but the fraction of CTC-active cells remained quite constant \n(manuscript in preparation). This may indicate that the observed short-term responses are \nmore due to the variation of activity rates of individual active cells than to variation of \nproportion of active cells in the total community.  \n\nResponses expressed by hydrolytic and uptake enzymatic systems were probably \nnot related to the production of the relevant enzymes. Shifting between different enzymatic \nsystems with distinct kinetic characteristics [36], and the direct effects of salinity on the \nstructure and integrity of enzymatic systems, could explain the ready variation of the levels \nof activity. In fact, preliminary results showed that the increase of salinity of I6 water from \n10 to 30 PSU by addition of NaCl produced an immediate reduction of Leu-AMPase and \n? -GLCase activities to values corresponding respectively to 53 and 42 % of the initial Hm \nvalues (data not shown).  \n\nChanges in water properties had a greater effect on the direct uptake of small \nmolecules (Glucose Vm and BBP according to the method) than on ectoenzymatic \nactivities. This may be related to the variability of the organic sources. Monomer uptake \nresponds to variations in the DOM pool [29, 31, 32], which in this study was larger in the \nbrackish water zone. Ectoenzymatic activity, on the contrary, may be regulated by the \navailability of the more complex substrates which could be partially adsorbed to particles \nand, in this form, would not exert any effect on the confined test communities since they \nwould not percolate into the chambers through the 0.2 \u00b5m pores of the membranes. In \naddition, the increase in the availability of monomers after transference of marine samples \nto brackish water could even reduce the activity of ectoenzymatic systems [7] and, in this \n\n\n\nShort-time responses to changing water properties  \n \n\n 68 \n\nway, counterbalance, to some extent, the stimulatory effect of the increase in the \navailability of dissolved polymers.  \n\nIn the March and June experiments, when the salinity values at the brackish water \nsection were quite high (> 18 PSU), responses were stronger and bacterial activity in the \ntest samples reached levels identical to those of the natural community of the contrasting \nwater type. This could imply that the communities were not significantly distinct and that \nthe expression of activity would be highly susceptible to environmental control. However, \nin February, when the salinity difference between the initial N1 and I6 samples was \nmaximal, the reaction of the marine community to brackish water conditions was weak \n(BBP and glucose Vm) or undetectable (Leu-AMPase and ? -GLCase). This could be \nexpected from a marine community resenting the lower salinity of the brackish water and \nso being less capable of taking advantage of higher concentration of organic substrates. \nSome parallel experiments revealed that, during summer, the stimulation of the marine \ncommunity exposed to water from the inner section of the estuary was enhanced if NaCl \nwas added up to a salinity of 34 PSU (Almeida, unpublished data). These results could \nindicate the existence of communities with distinct salinity optima.  \n\nThe different reversibility of the responses was interpreted as a further indication of \nthe distinct nature of the two communities. The stimulation of the marine community \nrapidly ceased after transference to marine water. On the contrary, brackish communities \ndid not recover from the loss of activity and their inhibition generally persisted even after 4 \nhours of incubation in their natural water. The unrecoverable loss of activity was not \naccompanied by significant variation in bacterial abundance. This supports the assertion \nthat viability, rather than the recognisable size of the community, was negatively affected \nby salinity, eventually in an irreversible way.  \n\nThe short-term reactivity of bacterioplankton to changes in salinity and in the \ndegree of eutrophication in a shallow estuary such as the Ria de Aveiro, is compatible with \nthe hypothesis of activation and deactivation of bacterial cells during tidal transport and \nhas major implications in the understanding of estuarine profiles of bacterioplankton \nactivity. The stimulation of marine bacterial cells during flood transport, and the opposite \neffect on brackish-water bacteria during the ebb, will magnify the difference in \nheterotrophic activity between the outer and mid sections of the estuary and produce \nsteeper gradients than those expected from the conservative mixture of distinct \ncommunities. \n\n \n \n\n\n\nShort-time responses to changing water properties  \n \n\n 69 \n\nAcknowledgements \nWe thank Sizenando Abreu from the Chemistry Department of the University of \n\nAveiro for the inorganic nutrient determinations.

A., Almeida, M. A. and Alc\u00e2ntara, F. (2001)  \n\nActa Oecologica  (submitted) \n\n \n_________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n \n\nAbstract - In order to assess the relative importance of tidal resuspension of sediments and transport of \nparticles from salt marshes as factors of variability in bacterioplankton abundance and activity, a transect was \ndefined at one of the most productive sections of a shallow estuarine system (Ria de Aveiro, Portugal). \nBacterial abundance, ectoenzymatic activity and heterotrophic metabolism of glucose were assayed in \nsamples collected at four sites in the transect during four springtime tidal cycles. \nThe patterns of variation of particulate materials (seston, POC and chlorophyll a) along the transect did not \nshow significant relation with proximity to the margin or to the bottom sediment. Nevertheless, proximity to \nthe salt marsh or to the bottom sediment surface favoured glucose incorporation and aminopeptidase activity. \nA multiple stepwise regression analysis using temperature, salinity, seston, POC and chlorophyll a  \nconcentration as independent variables could explain a relatively small proportion (12 \u2013 43 %) of the \nobserved variability in different bacterioplankton parameters, with the exception of the fraction of particle -\nattached bacteria (66.5 % of the variability was explained). \nResuspension and runoff, in the strict sense of transference of particulate materials, could not be clearly \ndistinguished in the spatial patterns of variation of the particulate variables. This, together with the poor \ncontribution of these parameters to the transversal and tidal variability of bacterial activity, dismisses the \nimportance of inputs of suspended material across the sediment/water interface and from neighbour salt \nmarshes in the control of bacterial activity, that, instead, may be exerted through DOM fluxes.  \n\n \n\n \n\nKey words : Estuarine bacterioplankton; ectoenzymatic activity; heterotrophic activity; \nsediment resuspension. \n \n\n \n\n1. Introduction \n \n\nDifferent processes of transference of materials between benthic and planktonic \ncompartments, as well as between salt marshes and the main estuarine body, may intervene \nsignificantly in the supply of substrates to the plankton. This contribution may be decisive \nin the dynamics of estuarine bacterioplankton. Maxima of bacterial abundance and \nheterotrophic activity along estuarine gradients are often found in high turbidity zones \n(Erckenbracher and Stevenson, 1975; Wright and Coffin 1983; Fuks et al., 1991) \n\n\n\nInfluence of particles on bacterioplankton metabolism \n \n\n 72 \n\nindicating a tight coupling between particle inputs and stimulation of bacterial \nheterotrophic activity. Bacterial communities are able to respond quickly to these inputs \nbecause of their rapid growth rates and high physiological diversity (Wainright, 1987). \nTherefore, resuspension events and runoff from the margins are sometimes vented as \npossible explanations for high productivity at mid and inner estuarine sections (Hoppe et \nal., 1996).  \n\nSeveral studies have shown that mechanical resuspension of sediment particles either \nby tidal currents, wind forcing, wind- induced waves, dredging or bottom trawling, caused \nsignificant increase in seston content, particulate organic carbon, particulate organic \nnitrogen, chlorophyll a and bacterial biomass (Demers et al., 1987; Riemann and \nHoffmann, 1991; Ritzrau and Graf, 1992). Different types of experimental approaches \nhave confirmed these field observations. Bacterial biomass production significantly \nincreased in water samples that were in physical contact with the sediment surface and the \nstimulation was more intense when sediments were heavily colonised by \nmicrophytobenthos (Middelboe et al., 1998). Bacterial abundance and total cell volume \nresponded positively to amendment of natural seawater with resuspended particulate \nmaterial (Wainright, 1987). Induced sediment resuspension in mesocosm experiments also \nincreased chlorophyll a concentrations in the water and caused significant stimulation of \nbacterioplankton biomass production (Sloth et al., 1996).  \n\nDensely colonised salt marshes frequently found in the banks of estuarine channels \nmay also export considerable amounts of materials to the main body of the estuary (Dame \net al., 1986) through processes of advective transport of solutes and particles. However, the \ndissolved compounds may dominate the net flux of organic carbon from the marshes to the \nestuary (Taylor and Allanson, 1995). \n\nPrevious studies on the dynamics of bacterioplankton in the Ria de Aveiro allowed \nthe identification of the shallow sections of different channels as sites of intense bacterial \nheterotrophic activity (Hoppe et al., 1996; Cunha et al., 1999; Cunha et al., 2000). Here, \nwe report on a field approach to test the hypothesis that particles transported from the salt \nmarshes and/or resuspended from the sediment may stimulate the heterotrophic activity of \nbacterioplankton communities and are ultimately related to the establishment of high rates \nof ectoenzymatic activity and glucose heterotrophic metabolism at an intermediate section \nof one of the main channels (Canal de \u00cdlhavo) of the lagoon. \n \n \n \n\n\n\nInfluence of particles on bacterioplankton metabolism \n \n\n 73 \n\n2. Materials and methods  \n \n\nStudy site \nRia de Aveiro (Figure 1) is a branched estuarine ecosystem, also described as a \n\ncoastal lagoon, in the Northwest coast of Portugal, \nwith the maximum length and width of 45 and  \n10 Km, respectively. The tidal range at the mouth \nvaries from 0.6 m in neap tides to 3.2 m in spring \ntides (Dias et al., 2000 ). The average depth of the \nlagoon is 1  m and the shallow brackish water \nsections (&lt;3 m deep) account for approximately  \n95 % of the total wet area at high tide (83 Km2) and \ntogether, encompass 75 % of the total volume of \nwater of 161 Mm3 (Silva, 1994; Dias et al., 2000). \nThe deeper marine zone varies in depth from 10 to \n> 20 m at high tide. \n\nThis study took place at the transect I6 located \nat the shallow brackish water section of Canal de \n\u00cdlhavo, with its origin at the main navigation \nchannel and extending to Southeast. Along the \ntransect, 4 sampling sites were defined: S1 and S2 \nrespectively at approximately 0.5 and 1.5 m from \nthe west margin; S3 and S4 referred to the centre of \nthe channel (taken as the deeper point) were located \nrespectively at 5 m from the centre (measured \nwestwards) and at the centre itself.  \n\n \n \nSampling  \nTransect I6 was visited 4 times from April to \n\nMay 1997, under spring (6th and 22nd May) and \nneap (29th April and 30th May) tide conditions. \nWater samples were collected 0.2 m below water \nsurface at all stations and also at 0.5 m above the \nsediment surface at the deeper sites (S3 and S4). In \n\nFigure 1: Iberian Peninsula and Ria de \nAveiro lagoon (Portugal) with \nsampling transect I6 at Canal de \n\u00cdlhavo indicated by the arrow. \n\nN\n\nI6\n\n\n\nInfluence of particles on bacterioplankton metabolism \n \n\n 74 \n\neach sampling day, samples were collected at 6 moments of the tidal cycle: low tide (LT), \n2 hours after low tide (LT+2), 2 hours before high tide (HT-2), high tide (HT), 2 hours \nafter high tide (HT+2) and 2 hours before low tide (LT-2). All samples were kept cold and \nin the shade during transport to the laboratory where they were processed within 2-3 hours \nfrom collection. \n\n \n \nPhysical and chemical characteristics \nTemperature and salinity were measured with a WTW LF 196 Conductivity Meter. \n\nDepth of the water column was determined with a Sonar probe (Hondex PS-7 LCD Digital \nSounder). Approximate distance to the west margin was visually estimated. \n\nThe concentrations of total (seston) and organic (POM) suspended solids were \ndetermined according to Parsons et al. (1989). Particulate organic carbon (POC) was \nassumed to be 50% of the POM (Rodier, 1996). Chlorophyll a was quantified \nfluorimetrically (Yentsch and Menzel, 1963) in a Jasco FP-777 espectrofluorimeter after \nextraction with 90% acetone. \n\n \n \nBacterioplankton characteristics \nThe densities of the total bacterial community (TBN) and of the particle-attached \n\nfraction (AB) were determined by direct counting under epifluorescence microscopy (Leitz \nLaborlux) after staining with 0.03% acridine orange of cells collected on Poretics 0.2 \u00b5m \nblack polycarbonate membranes (Hobbie et al., 1977).  \n\nEctoenzymatic activity was determined fluorimetrically (Jasco FP-777 Fluorometer) \nas the maximum hydrolysis rate (Hm) of two model substrates (Hoppe, 1983),  \n4-methylumbelliferyl-? -D-glucoside for ? -glucosidase (BTGLase) and L-leucine-7-amido-\n4-methyl-coumarin for Leu-aminopeptidase (AMPase), added up to a saturating \nconcentration of 1 mM. Samples were incubated 1-2 hours at in situ temperature. For the \ndiscrimination of the contribution of attached bacteria to total ectoenzymatic activity, water \nsamples were fractionated by gentle vacuum filtration (&lt;50 mmHg) through 1.2 \u00b5m pore \ncellulose nitrate membranes (Sartorius). Determinations of ectoenzymatic activities were \nperformed in the whole water samples and in the &lt;1.2 \u00b5m fractions. \n\nThe heterotrophic metabolism of glucose was described by the parameters Vm \n(ma ximum uptake velocity) and Tr (turnover rate) following the procedure described by \nGocke (1977). Vm was determined after the addition of a final saturation concentration of \n\n\n\nInfluence of particles on bacterioplankton metabolism \n \n\n 75 \n\n430 nM of 14C-glucose (Amersham, SA 11.5 GBq mmol-1, 310 mCi mmol-1). Incubations \nwere carried out for 2 hours at in situ temperature.  Cells were later collected on Poretics \n0.2 \u00b5m polycarbonate membranes and radioactivity was read in a liquid scintillation \ncounter Beckman LS 6000 IC using UniverSol as the scintillation cocktail. For Tr \ndeterminations a tracer concentration of 43 nm of 14C-glucose was used. The incorporated \nfraction was determined after collection of cells on 0.2 \u00b5m Poretics polycarbonate \nmembranes and the respired fraction was determined after acidification of the sample and \ncapture of the 14CO2 on ethanolamine (Merck).  \n\n \n \nStatistical analyses \nThe significance of the effect of the sampling site on the variability of chlorophyll a, \n\nPOC and bacteriological parameters was analysed by one-way ANOVA. Homogeneity of \nvariances was verified by Levene tests. Tukey Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) was \nused for Post Hoc Multiple Comparison.  \n\nMultiple correlation analysis was performed with the aim of extracting statistically \nsignificant relations between biological parameters describing bacterial abundance and \nactivity on one side, and on the other, either distance to the margin or to the sediments. \n\nA multiple stepwise regression analysis was used to identify major environmental \nfactors controlling tidal and transversal fluctuations of bacterial abundance and activity and \nto quantify their relative contribution to total variability. Temperature, salinity, seston, \nPOC (total or as a percentage of seston) and chlorophyll a were used as independent \nvariables. \n\nAll statistical analyses were performed with the SPSSWin 7.1 package. \n \n \n3.

In this study, we \nwere focused on tidal and \ntransversal sources of \nvariability rather than on \nlongitudinal gradients. \n\nThe results from ANOVA \nanalysis indicated that in most \ncases, the differences in \nbacterial abundance and \nactivity levels between distinct \nsampling sites were not \nsignificant after integration of \ndata representing different tidal \nphases or tidal cycles. \n\nEven though the \navailability of particulate \nsubstrates did not seem to be \ndirectly controlled by local \nsediment resuspension or \nrunoff, the multiple correlation analysis confirmed that the proximity to the salt-marsh \nedge and to the sediment surface favoured monomer uptake and protein degradation at the \nlevel of individual cells. Considering that a clear transversal pattern of variation of \nparticulate compounds could not be established and that the turnover of glucose, and even \nprotein degradation, are better related to the dissolved pool of organic matter, the results \nmight be interpreted as an indication that DOM rather than POM is regulating bacterial \nmetabolism at these interfaces. \n\nThe next step was to check if variables describing the availability of particulate \nsubstrates were found among the major environmental factors controlling tidal and \ntransversal variability of bacterial abundance, ectoenzymatic activity, glucose uptake and \nturnover. Stepwise multiple regression showed that the fraction of attached bacteria was \nnegatively related to salinity and positively related to chlorophyll a (Table 4).

The variability of the total \nsize of the bacterial community remained mostly unexplained (adjusted R2 = 0.184) even \nthough it showed a negative relation to POC and positive relation to chlorophyll a.  \n\nEctoenzymatic activities showed to be positively associated to chlorophyll a  \n(Table 4) suggesting that primary production may be an important source of substrates. \nBTGLase showed negative relation to salinity as expected since it is generally considered \nthat BTGLase is relatively more important in low salinity environments while AMPase is \nwidespread along estuarine gradients (Murrell et al., 1999; Cunha et al., 2000). The \nabsolute coincidence observed between factors related to total AMPase and BTGLase and \nthe corresponding cell- specific activities indicates that the variations in total activity may \ncorrespond essentia lly to shifts in the levels of activity of the individual cells rather than in \nthe total size of the community. The results also suggest that active attached bacterial cells \nwere probably mostly transported from upper sections rather than locally imported from \n\nAminopeptidase\n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\nS1 S2 S3 S4\n\nn\nm\n\no\nl l\n\n-1\n h\n\n-1\n\nCell-specific aminopeptidase\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\nS1 S2 S3 S4\n\nat\nto\n\nm\nol\n\n c\nel\n\nl-1\n h\n\n-1\n\nBetaglucosidase\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nS1 S2 S3 S4\nn\nm\n\no\nl l\n\n-1\n h\n\n-1\n\nCell-specific betaglucosidase\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\nS1 S2 S3 S4\n\nat\nto\n\nm\nol\n\n c\nel\n\nl-1\n h\n\n-1\n\nGlucose Vm\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nS1 S2 S3 S4\n\nn\nm\n\no\nl l\n\n-1\n h\n\n-1\n\nCell-specific glucose Vm\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nS1 S2 S3 S4\nat\n\nto\nm\n\nol\n c\n\nel\nl-1\n\n h\n-1\n\nFigure 7: Means and 95 % confidence intervals (error bars) for the different sampling sites along transect I6. \nHomogeneous subsets obtained with the Tukey test are displayed only in the chart corresponding to the \nparameter for which significant differences between stations were found with one-way ANOVA (cell-\nspecific glucose Vm). \n \n\n\n\nInfluence of particles on bacterioplankton metabolism \n \n\n 84 \n\nthe margins, as the proportion of \nectoenzymatic activity associated to \nthe > 1.2 \u00b5m fraction was also \n\nnegatively related to salinity (Table \n4). \n\nAlthough its source could not \nbe directly related to the salt marshes \nor to the bottom sediments, POC \nshowed significant, even though \ncontrasting, relations to different \nvariables describing heterotrophic \nbacterial activity. Carbohydrate \ndegradation (BTGLase) was \npositively affected by the increase of \nPOC but this last variable was \nnegatively associated to the \nheterotrophic metabolism of glucose \n(glucose Vm and Tr). This indicates \n\nthat inputs of particulate organic substrates were no t accompanied by the corresponding \nincrease in the availability of monomers and suggesting that bacterial utilization of \norganic-C was limited by ectoenzymatic degradation of complex substrates.  \n\nIn the particular conditions of the shallow sections of the Aveiro lagoon, local \nresuspension and runoff may be less important as factors of substrate supply than the \ntransport of particles from upstream. Considering that the nature of the sediment at transect \nI6, ranges from very coarse sand with 6 % (w/w) organic matter at the West margin, to fine \nsand with 2 % (w/w) organic matter at the East margin (Cunha et al., 1999) some \ntransference of particles from the sediments to the water column could be anticipated. \nHowever, current speed at this section, as well as at most of the shallow sections of the \nestuary, is rather low, never exceeding 0.4 ms-1 (Dias et al., 2000). Low current speed may \nfavour sedimentation during most part of the tidal cycle since susceptibility to resuspension \nis strongly driven by tidal forcing (Blanchard et al., 1997). In the conditions of the shallow \nbrackish water section of the Ria de Aveiro, the benthic compartment as well as the salt \nmarshes may well retain POM, as observed in other estuaries (Taylor and Allanson, 1995; \nYin and Harrison, 2000). \n\n \n\n Depth Distance to \n\n west margin  \n\nSeston 0.049 -0.78 \n\nPOC 0.050 -0.076 \n\nChlorophyll a -0.044 0.020 \n\nTBN -0.126 -0.056 \n\nAB -0.096 0.011 \n\nAMPase -0.025 0.031 \n\nAMPase >1.2\u00b5m 0.050 0.125 \n\nSpecific particulate AMPase -0.222* -0.100 \n\nBTGLase -0.065 -0.063 \n\nBTGLase>1.2\u00b5m -0.024 0.146 \n\nSpecific particulate BTGLase -0.094 0.034 \n\nGlucose Vm -0.010 -0.072 \n\nSpecific glucose Vm -0.720** -0.303** \n\nTable 3: Results of the analysis of correlation between \nenvironmental and bacterioplankton variables and depth or \ndistance to the margin.

The \nadvection of simple organic substrates at these interfaces may explain these effects.  \n\nContrasting to the remova l of particles through sedimentation, considerable inputs of \nDOM to the water column may be expected since density displacement of interstitial water \n\n\n\nInfluence of particles on bacterioplankton metabolism \n \n\n 86 \n\ncauses the release of nutrients (Webster et al., 1996). This process has been directly related \nto the increase of dark oxygen uptake, glucose Vm and the turnover rate of amino acids by \nthe bacterioplankton community in mesocosm experiments (von Bodungen et al., 1995). \nHopkinson et al. (1998) could also establish a linear relation between bacterioplankton \ngrowth rates and the DOC concentration in the water, achieved after exposure to benthic \nsediments.  \n\nGlobally, the results show some relations between availability of particulate organic \nsubstrates (POC, chlorophyll a) and levels of bacterial activity. However, resuspension and \nrunoff, understood in the strict sense of processes of transference of particulate materials, \ndo not directly explain the dense populations established at the shallow sections of the \nestuary or the high heterotrophic activity rates here observed. Therefore we believe, even \nthough in this study the characterization of DOM was not attempted, that dissolved carbon \nmay be the major factor controlling vertical and transversal variations of bacterioplankton \nheterotrophic activity. \n \n \nAcknowledgeme nts \n \n\nThis work was partially supported by PRODEP II, POCTI (Potuguese Foundation for \nScience and Technology) and CZCM (Centro das Zonas Costeiras e do Mar, University of \nAveiro, Portugal). \n \n \nReferences \n \nBlanchard G.F., Sauriau P.-G., Cariou-Le Gall V., \n\nGouleau D., Garet M.-J., Olivier F.

Bacterial numbers  \n(0.2 \u2013 8.1 x 109 cells l-1), aminopeptidase activity (189 \u2013 1662 nmol l-1h-1), ? -glucosidase activity  \n(1.7 \u2013 67.0 nmol l-1h-1) and potential glucose incorporation (0.48 \u2013 3.99 nmol l-1h-1) varied according to a \nconsistent pattern of enrichment during ebb-tide and showing decrease during flood tide.  \nFluxes of bacterioplankton populations and associated heterotrophic activities between the estuary and the \ncoastal area during the time period equivalent to a tidal cycle were estimated from the water flux determined \nusing a two -dimensional vertically integrated numerical model. The net fluxes estimated for the period \nequivalent to a tidal cycle ranged from -2.5 to +26.0 x 1016 bacterial cells. The net tidal fluxes of potential \nheterotrophic activities ranged from -80 to -10 mol h-1 for aminopeptidase, -1.10 to -0.33 mol h-1 for  \n? -glucosidase and -0.18 to +0.03 mol h-1 for glucose incorporation. Net fluxes were generally negative in \nsign indicating the transfer of phyto- and bacterioplankton, as well as potential capacities for the degradation \nand recycling of organic matter, from the outer estuarine compartment to the sea. \n\n \n \nKey words: Estuarine bacterioplankton; tidal fluxes \n \n \n1. Introduction \n \n\nEstuaries are interface ecosystems that functionally couple continental and marine \n\nenvironments, receiving biogeochemically active inputs from land, rivers and the coastal \n\nsea. The estuarine environment is often reported as extremely productive, supporting dense \n\nbacterioplankton communities and high rates of primary production and bacterial \n\nheterotrophic activity (Barbosa, 1991; Fuks et al., 1991, Hoppe et al., 1996; Revilla et al., \n\n2000). The basic model of salt- marsh estuaries as exporting systems usually referred as the \n\n\u201cOutwelling Hypothesis\u201d (Odum, 1968; Dame et al., 1986) can be extended to incorporate \n\nthe passive transport of living cells and their associated heterotrophic activities. \n\n\n\nFluxes of bacterioplankton at the interface with the sea  \n \n\n 90 \n\nMajor transformations of the pools of organic and inorganic nutrients that reach the \n\nmain body of the estuary are related to biological processes associated to bacterioplankton \n\ncommunities. (Billen and Garnier, 1997; Cloern, 2001). These, in their turn, strongly \n\nrespond to environmental stimuli (Cunha et al., 2001), namely variations in nutrient \n\navailability (Hoppe et al., 1998). High fresh-water inputs and the corresponding increase in \n\nthe concentration of labile organic compounds enhance the levels heterotrophic activity of \n\nestuarine bacteria (Murrell et al., 1999) and impose a river-driven seasonality on the way \n\nthe estuary interacts with the nearby ocean (Cloern and Nichols, 1985). However, in \n\nestuaries where the processes of transport of materials are mostly driven by tidal forcing, \n\nthe variability associated to the semi-diurnal time scale prevails over seasonal effects \n\n(Smith, 2001). The tidal flooding of salt marshes and mud-flats, and the advection of \n\ndissolved nutrients from the sediments stimulate bacterial activity in the water column \n\n(Trousellier, 1993; von Bodungen et al., 1995; Ritzrau et al., 1997) and are probably major \n\nfactors underlying the persistence of dense and active bacterioplankton communities in \n\nshallow estuarine sections (Hoppe et al., 1996; Cunha et al., 2000). \n\nThis work reports on an attempt to test in the field the hypothesis that in a shallow \n\nmesotidal estuarine system, such as Ria de Aveiro, exports of bacterioplankton and \n\npotential heterotrophic activities to the coastal ocean can occur under the summer regime \n\nof low fresh water input. With that aim, tidal dynamics of bacterioplankton were \n\ncharacterised in terms of (a) patterns of variability of abundance and activity and (b) sign \n\nand magnitude of the fluxes of cells and potential activities at the interface with the sea. \n\n \n \n2. Materials and methods  \n\n \n\nStudy area \n\nRia de Aveiro (Figure 1) is a bar-built estuary (Pritchard, 1989), also described as a \n\ncoastal lagoon, in the Northwest coast of Portugal. It is a complex system characterised by \n\nnarrow channels and extensive intertidal zones. During spring tides, the maximal wet area \n\nis 83 km2 at high tide, reduced to 66 km2 at low tide (Dias et al., 2000). The estuary \n\nencompasses a total volume of water of approximately 160 Mm3 at high tide (Silva, 1994) \n\n\n\nFluxes of bacterioplankton at the interface with the sea  \n \n\n 91 \n\nand the total river discharge during the period equivalent \n\nto a tidal cycle is 1.8 Mm3 (Moreira et al., 1993). The \n\ntidal range varies between 0.6 m in neap tides and 3.2 m \n\nin spring tides, with an average value of about 2 m (Dias \n\net al., 2000).  \n\n \n\nStudy site \n\nThe investigation was conducted inside the lagoon \n\nassuming that a sampling station located close to the \n\nmouth would fairly represent the properties of the water \n\nmasses moving in and out the estuary. Station N1 \n\n (40\u00ba33\u2019N; 8\u00ba45\u2019W) was located in the main navigation \n\nchannel, approximately 2 Km from the mouth (Figure 1). \n\nSampling was performed during day-time along 5 spring \n\ntide cycles (01-06-96, 03-06-96, 28-08-96, 30-08-96 and \n\n02-09-97) and one neap tide cycle (10-09-97). In each \n\ntidal cycle, water samples were collected just below \n\nsurface (0.2 m) at 6 tidal phases at approximately 2-hour \n\nintervals including one slack low tide (LT) and one slack \n\nhigh tide (HT), for no longer than 14 hours. Samples were \n\nkept cold and in the shade during transport to the \n\nlaboratory. \n\n \n\nPhysical and chemical parameters  \n\nTemperature and salinity were measured with a WTW LF 196 Conductivity Meter \n\nand total depth of the water column was determined with a Sonar probe (Hondex PS-7 \n\nLCD Digital Sounder).  \n\nThe determination of the concentration of suspended solids (seston) in estuarine \n\nsamples was performed after filtration of 500 ml aliquots through Whatman GF/C (47 mm \n\ndiameter) pre-weighted, pre-combusted filters. The filters were dried at 60 \u00baC for 24 hours \n\nand seston content was calculated as the increase in weight. Particulate organic matter \n\n \n\nN\n\nN1  ? ? ?  \n\n \n\nFigure 1: Ria de Aveiro (Portugal) \nwith sampling station N1 indicated \nwith arrow. \n\n\n\nFluxes of bacterioplankton at the interface with the sea  \n \n\n 92 \n\n(POM) was determined through the difference in the weight of the dry seston filters after 4 \n\nhours incineration at 525 \u00baC of the dry seston (Parsons et al., 1989).  \n\nChlorophyll a was quantified fluorimetrically (Yentsch and Menzel, 1963) in a Jasco \n\nFP-777 espectrofluorimeter. A total volume of 0.5 l of water was filtered through \n\nWhatman GF/C filters and later extracted with 10 ml of 90% acetone. Determinations were \n\nperformed in 3 replicates of each sample. \n\n \n\nMicrobiological parameters  \n\nTotal bacterial number (TBN) was determined by cell counting under \n\nepifluorescence microscopy after fixation of water samples with 2 % formaldehyde (final \n\nconcentration). The samples (3 replicates) were then filtered through 0.2 \u00b5m black \n\npolycarbonate membranes (Poretics) and stained with 0.03 % acridine orange (Hobbie et \n\nal., 1977).  \n\nThe determination of maximum uptake velocity of glucose (glucose Vm) followed \n\nthe procedure described by Gocke (1977) in 3 replicates and 1 blank of each sample. A \n\nfinal saturation concentration of 430 nM of 14C-glucose (Amersham SA 11.5 GBq mmol-1, \n\n310 mCi mmol-1) added to 10 ml aliquots was chosen after kinetic analysis was. \n\nIncubations were carried out for 2-3 hours at in situ temperature. Cells were collected on \n\n0.2 \u00b5m Poretics polycarbonate membranes and radioactivity was read in a liquid \n\nscintillation counter (Beckman LS 6000 IC) using UniverSol as scintillation cocktail.  \n\nEctoenzymatic activity was determined fluorimetrically (Jasco FP-777 Fluorometer) \n\nas the maximum hydrolysis rate (Hm) of model substrates (Sigma-Aldrich) for ? -\n\nglucosidase (4- methylumbelliferyl-? -D-glucoside) and Leu-aminopeptidase (L- leucine-7-\n\namido-4-methyl-coumarin) according to Hoppe (1983). Saturation was achieved with  \n\n1 mM of both substrates. Wavelengths for excitation and emission were respectively 380 \n\nand 440 nm for MCA (7-amino-4-methylcoumarine) and 360 and 450 nm for MUF (4-\n\nmethylumbelliferone). Measurements were made in 3 replicates for each sample after 1-2 \n\nhours incubations at in situ temperature. Calibration was performed by adding a series of 8 \n\nconcentrations of the fluorescent products (0-500 nM for MUF and 0-6 \u00b5M for MCA) to a \n\npool of water from all the samples analysed in each day. \n\n \n\n\n\nFluxes of bacterioplankton at the interface with the sea  \n \n\n 93 \n\nEstimation of estuarine fluxes \n\nThe tidal balance of several water properties was estimated as the difference between \n\nthe integrated ebb and flood tide flows through a transverse section of the channel defined \n\nat station N1. In order to determine estuarine fluxes in time periodic current fields, water \n\nflow and properties concentrations are usually measured in cross-sectional structures along \n\nthe tidal cycle (Taylor and Allanson, 1995). Due to the very difficult working conditions at \n\nthe station location, in this work determinations were only performed at a fixed depth \n\ncorresponding to 0.2 m below surface, and at approximately 2-hours intervals. Ria de \n\nAveiro is, however, vertically well- mixed and laterally homogeneous (Dias et al., 1999), \n\nand therefore it can be considered that the measured values fairly represent the structure of \n\nthe correspondent property. In addition, Ria de Aveiro is a very shallow environment \n\nwhich makes adequate the use of vertically integrated numerical models to determine the \n\nintegrated water flow. \n\nIn this work a two-dimensional vertically- integrated numerical model (2DV) was \n\napplied. This solves the well-known shallow-water equations. This model was previously \n\ncalibrated (Dias et al., 1998) and has been used in studies of tidal dynamics of the Ria de \n\nAveiro (Dias et al., 2000), where it proved to be able to reproduce the tidal prism values \n\ncomputed by other authors for the main channels of Ria de Aveiro (Dias, 2001).  \n\nThe 2DV numerical model was used to compute time series of water flow (time-step \n\nof 40 s) through the transverse section of the channel including station N1, during each one \n\nof the tidal cycles. The slack water times were also determined from the numerical results, \n\nallowing the estimation of the time of null flux. Instantaneous cross-sectional fluxes of \n\nsalinity, chlorophyll, POM, ectoenzymatic activities, glucose incorporation and bacterial \n\nabundance were estimated as the result of the product of the field data measured at a given \n\ntime by the simultaneous numerically computed water flow. New values corresponding to \n\nthe slack water time (null instantaneous fluxes) were also included.  \n\nBoth water flow and properties concentrations were considered to have nearly \n\nsinusoidal time evolution patterns in Ria de Aveiro (Hoppe et al., 1996; Cunha et al., \n\n2000). Consequently, it was expected that the fluxes of most properties could reveal a \n\nparallel temporal variation. Therefore, time series of instantaneous fluxes during a tidal \n\ncycle were produced by polynomial interpolation of the value of the products of the field \n\n\n\nFluxes of bacterioplankton at the interface with the sea  \n \n\n 94 \n\ndata by the numerical results, using a third degree polynomial approximation. As expected, \n\nthese curves fited very well with the numerically computed water flow curves. Estuarine \n\nfluxes through the transverse section were later calculated integrating the ebb and flood \n\ntide series. \n\n \n \n3.

Salinity maxima and minima were \n\nalways observed at high and low tide, \n\nrespectively.  \n\nSeston (17-222 mg l-1)  and POM \n\n(6-31 mg l-1) strongly fluctuated during \n\nthe tidal cycles but a clear pattern could \n\nnot be identified (Figure 2).

Discussion \n \n\nTidal bacterioplankton dynamics at the interface with the sea \n\nRia de Aveiro is generally described as estuarine system with a complex topography. \n\nThe location of station N1 was defined in order to allow the best approximation to the \n\nphysical, chemical and biological properties of the water at the mouth of the estuary since \n\nthe total volume of water that crosses this section corresponds to 90 % of the total tidal \n\npris m (Silva, 1994). Since fieldwork at the highly turbulent section between the origin of \n\nCanal de Mira and the mouth proved to be impracticable for security reasons, the \n\ncontribution of this channel was left out of the current study.  \n\nThe patterns of tidal variation of salinity and temperature observed at station N1 \n\nindicate that daytime warming occurred as salinity decreased during ebbing. The lagoon \n\nhas an average depth of 1 m and the shallow sections (&lt;3 m) correspond to approximately  \n\n95 % of the high tide wet area (Silva, 1994). This allows significant warming of the water \n\ncolumn due to insolation, especially during the warm season. The net export of heat from \n\nthe estuary to offshore waters was previously reported by Dias et al. (1999). \n\nThe concentration of particulate matter did not follow a regular pattern along the \n\ntidal cycles. This uncoupling from salinity has also been reported for the variation of DOC \n\nat other temperate estuarine systems and is interpreted as an indication of tidally induced \n\nresuspension/sedimentation events that may exert a major control over the concentration of \n\nparticles in the water column (Miller, 1999). However, in the Ria de Aveiro, like in other \n\nshallow estuarine systems, the sediment-bed and the salt marsh tend to retain particles and \n\nexport solutes (Newell and Krambeck, 1995; Almeida et al., accepted for publication). \n\nAssuming that POC corresponds to 50 % of the POM (Rodier, 1996) and using a factor of \n\n50 to convert chlorophyll to phytoplankton\u2013C (Eppley et al., 1977), we can estimate that \n\nPOC corresponds to 4-19 % of the seston and that phytoplankton biomass corresponds to \n\n6-14 % of the POC. These values fit within the ranges usually reported for productive \n\n\n\nFluxes of bacterioplankton at the interface with the sea  \n \n\n 99 \n\ncoastal ecosystems (Charpy et al., 1997; Canuel and Zimmerman, 1999). The high organic \n\ncontent of suspended matter may be related to inputs of inorganic nutrients and labile \n\nDOM at the mid- and inner-estuarine sections that cause the increase of phyto- and \n\nbacterioplankton biomasses to values that are up to 9 times higher than at the outer section \n\n(Cunha et al., 2000). Tidal transport of cells from upper sections of the estuary induced a \n\nregular pattern characterised by an ebb-tide enrichment in phyto- (1.3 \u2013 1.4 fold) and \n\nbacterioplankton (1.1 \u2013 10 fold). \n\nBacterial potent ial ectoenzymatic activity and glucose incorporation also increased at \n\nstation N1 during ebbing and decreased during flood. However, tidal fluctuation of activity \n\nvariables was less pronounced than the fluctuation of bacterial abundance. This \n\nconservative tidal fluctuation of activity parameters when compared with the fluctuation of \n\nabundance at station N1 may result from the anti-parallel fluctuation of total abundance \n\nand specific activity of bacterial cells. Experimental data referring bacterial communities \n\nof this estuarine system indicate that bacterioplankton heterotrophic activity strongly \n\nresponds to changing water properties and is negatively affected by salinity (Cunha et al., \n\n2001). According to this scenario, the activity of individual cells and the viability of the \n\ncommunity may decrease at station N1 during ebbing, as total abundance increases with \n\nupper estuarine inputs. On the contrary, when ocean water is entering the estuary, the \n\ndensity of the community is decreasing but cells are probably gaining vigour in response to \n\nthe rising nutrient availability.  \n\n \n\nFluxes between the estuary and the coastal oceanic area \n\nEstuarine impacts on coastal ocean often result in the formation of plumes of \n\nelevated chlorophyll concentration, bacterial abundance, biomass production, nitrification, \n\nand total community respiration (Bianchi et al., 1999a; Bianchi et al., 1999b; Malone and \n\nDucklow, 1990; Pakulski et al., 2000). The attempt to quantify fluxes of salt and biogenic \n\nelements between the Aveiro estuarine system and the adjacent Atlantic coast during the \n\nsummer period showed a consistent seaward flux of bacterioplankton cells and potential \n\nheterotrophic activity.  \n\nThe magnitude of the exports from the estuary to the sea reflects the total size and \n\nactivity of estuarine communities and also the balance between marine and freshwater \n\n\n\nFluxes of bacterioplankton at the interface with the sea  \n \n\n 100 \n\ninputs to the main body of the estuary during each tidal cycle. The fluxes of bacterial cells \n\nand AMPase activity calculated for the studied 1996 tidal cycles decreased from early to \n\nmid summer, when salt imports increased, probably as consequence of the reduction in \n\nfreshwater inputs during the warm season (Simpson et al., 2001). ? -GLCase showed a \n\nmore irregular temporal pattern. Since this ectoenzymatic capacity is often reported as \n\nbeing particularly associated to low-salinity bacterial communities (Murrel et al., 1999), \n\nprocesses of activation and deactivation of the corresponding enzymes may be \n\nsuperimposed on transport effects. \n\nThe fluxes of particulate materials at the estuarine-ocean interface are more irregular \n\nin sign probably reflecting physical processes of re-allocation of sediments by tidal and/or \n\nresidual currents (Cloern and Nichols, 1985). Maximum current speed at the mouth of the \n\nestuary ranges 0.6-2.4 m s-1, (average  of 1.2 m s-1) depending on tidal range and other \n\nhydrographical conditions (Dias et al., 2000). During the tidal cycle a succession of \n\nconditions for resuspension, transport and deposition of particles may occur. Also, the \n\nfrequent disturbance of the channel bed by dredging works at this section of intense \n\nnavigation traffic may interfere with tidal fluxes of suspended sediments.  \n\nThe comparison between biogenic estuarine fluxes under spring and neap tide \n\nconditions is not conclusive. Results may indicate that other factors, rather than tidal range, \n\nare prevailing on the magnitude of the net estuarine fluxes. Neap tide exports, when \n\ncompared to spring tide, corresponded to a 6-fold increase in chlorophyll, a 32 % decrease \n\nin bacterial cells and a 63 % decrease of potential ? -glucosidase activity. On the contrary, \n\nneap tide had no significant impact on the export of potential aminopeptidase activity, in \n\nrelation to spring tide values, and coincided with a shift in the sign of the fluxes of salt and \n\nPOM. Short-term variations of the same order of magnitude were also observed in the \n\n1996 cycles, which corresponded to tides of similar range (2.8-3.0 m). The two pairs of \n\ncycles separated by 1-day intervals provide a perception of the amplitude of short-term \n\nvariability not related to changes in tidal range. The results may indicate that other factors \n\ncontrolling the size and activity of bacterioplankton inside the estuary and/or the \n\nmechanisms of estuarine water circulation exert major influence on the processes of \n\ntransference between the estuary and the sea. \n\n\n\nFluxes of bacterioplankton at the interface with the sea  \n \n\n 101 \n\nIn spite of the controversy on Odum\u2019s outwelling hypothesis (Odum, 1968) \n\nregarding the contribution of salt-marsh estuaries to the export of organic matter to the \n\nopen marine environment (Dame et al., 1986), this study brings evidence to the supply of \n\nthe coastal area with enriched bacterial communities and increased potential capacity for \n\nthe degradation and recycling of organic matter brought from the shallow estuary of Ria de \n\nAveiro. It was demonstrated that these exports occur during periods of low fresh water \n\ninputs, when the salt balance corresponded to a net retention of marine water inside the \n\nlagoon. Estuarine fluxes of bacterial cells and associated heterotrophic activities are most \n\nprobably supported by dense and active inner-estuarine communities and are, therefore, \n\nhighly dependent on the reactivity of bacterioplankton communities and on processes of \n\nstimulation or deactivation of heterotrophic capacities during transport along the estuarine \n\ngradient.  \n\n \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThis work was partially supported by PRODEP II, POCTI (Portuguese Foundation for \nScience and Technology) and CZCM (University of Aveiro, Portugal).

The \ncollection of samples should be conducted is such a way that spatial, chemical and/or \ntemporal variations could be fairly represented. However, the selection of the sampling \nsites is not exempt of criticism and some of the options are worth discussing in face of the \nparticular morphological and hydrographical features of the study area. \n\nThe Ria de Aveiro is a bar-built estuary (Pritchard, 1967), sometimes referred as a \ncoastal lagoon, that has a very irregular and complex geometry characterized by extensive \nintertidal zones and by an intricate net of narrow and shallow channels. The estuary is \nconnected to the ocean by an artificial channel 1.3 km long, 350 m wide and ~20 m deep \n(Dias et al., 2000). The Ria corresponds to a mesotidal estuary (Davies, 1964) with a tidal \nrange that is minimum in neap tides (0.6 m) and maximal in spring tides (3.2 m) (Dias et \nal., 1999). The tidal prim at the mouth and in spring tides is 83 Mm3 and the estuary \nencompasses a total volume of water of ~160 Mm3 in high tide (Silva, 1994). The total \nriver discharge during the period equivalent to a tidal cycle is 1.8 Mm3 (Moreira et al., \n1993). No significant signs of vertical stratification in terms of temperature and salinity are \ngenerally detected so the estuary is considered as well mixed (Dias et al., 1999). Four \nchannels originate from the main navigation channel with a correspondent distribution of \nthe tidal prism of 38 % for Canal de S. Jacinto (North), 26 % for Canal do Espinheiro \n(Northeast), 10 % for Canal de Mira (South) and 8 % for Canal de \u00cdlhavo (Southeast) \n(Silva, 1994). Maximum current speed at the mouth of the estuary ranges 0.6 \u2013 2.4 ms-1, \ndepending on hydrographical conditions, but at the shallow sections of the channels it \nnever exceeds 0.4 ms-1 (Dias et al., 2000).  \n\n\n\nDiscussion and conclusions \n \n\n 106 \n\nA first option corresponded to the definition of the extreme points of the estuary, \nwhich would represent the estuarine interfaces with the river and with the sea. The gateway \nto the sea should ideally be defined at the mouth of the Ria, right between peers. However, \nthe strong currents, the frequent dredging of the channel bed and the intense navigation \nmade anchoring at this section impracticable. According to Silva (1994) the volume of \nwater corresponding to the tidal prism at the first section of the main navigation channel \n(83 Mm3) is much larger that the volume that remains in low tide (28 Mm3) so an extensive \nrenovation of the water contained in this section during each tidal cycle was assumed. \nTherefore, a sampling station located approximately 1.5 km inwards to the mouth was \nselected to represent the interface with the sea (station N1). During tidal cycles, the small \nboat used during sampling was kept at a fixed position by attaching it to a navigation buoy, \nwhich was not positioned at the centre of the channel but slightly oriented towards the east \nmargin. It is possible that during ebbing, the water properties at this site were more \naffected by the flux associated with Canal de \u00cdlhavo than with either Canal de S. Jacinto or \nCanal do Espinheiro. Canal de Mira originates very close to the mouth and its contribution \nto the variability of bacterioplankton activity was excluded by the option of establishing \nthe interface with the sea at station N1. \n\nIn order to characterize the responses of bacterioplankton to an estuarine gradient, \nand considering that the Ria has an intricate topography, it become necessary to define a \nmodel sub-estuary (Canal de \u00cdlhavo) within the complex estuarine system. Some important \nattributes of Canal de \u00cdlhavo were taken into consideration: (1) Canal de \u00cdlhavo connects to \na permanent fresh water stream at its upper end which, even though it is not a major fresh \nwater affluent to the estuary (~5 % of total freshwater inputs), creates a distinct salinity \ngradient; (2) earlier studies developed along this channel provided preliminary information \non the longitudinal patterns of variation of hydrographical variables such as temperature, \nsalinity and sediment texture (Rodrigues, 1992); (3) although it is the shortest of the main \nbranches of the lagoon (~15 km length), Canal the \u00cdlhavo fairly represents the diversity of \nintertidal biotopes that occur within the estuarine system; (4) there is a marked shift in \nanthropogenic pressure associated to the margins from the outer (harbour facilities) to the \ninner sections (aquaculture ponds, industrial plants, diffuse domestic sewage inputs) of the \nchannel; (5) the channel is accessible from the margins along almost all the extension and \nnavigation is also possible in small recreation boats; (6) it is located within a short distance \nfrom the laboratory allowing a rapid processing of collected samples. \n\n \n \n\n\n\nDiscussion and conclusions \n \n\n 107 \n\nBacterioplankton reactivity to changing water properties \n\n \nEvidence for the high reactivity of bacterial communities to the changing properties \n\nof the water column was obtained from the analysis of field results and confirmed in \nlaboratory experiments. \n\nAssuming that Canal de \u00cdlhavo represents the estuarine gradients of salinity and \nnutrient availability established in the Ria de Aveiro, the results indicate that the peaks of \nbacterioplankton abundance and activity occur at sections of intermediate salinity (20- \n-30 PSU). This corresponds to a curvilinear pattern also observed in other temperate \nestuaries (Wright and Coffin, 1983; Palumbo et al., 1984; Fuks et al., 1991; Bordalo et al., \n1998). However, the salinity range corresponding to maxima in bacterial heterotrophic \npotential in the Ria is higher than in other estuaries where maxima occur at 3-10 PSU \n(Palumbo and Ferguson, 1978; Painchaud et al., 1995) or at 5-25 PSU (Pakulski et al., \n2000). The longitudinal pattern obtained in Canal de \u00cdlhavo may not accurately reflect the \ndistribution of bacterioplankton in the complex estuarine system of the Ria. The annual \naverage of the freshwater flux associated to Rio Boco during the period equivalent to a \ntidal cycle, corresponds to only ~1.5 % of the tidal prism at the outer section of this \nchannel (Silva, 1994) and the unbalance between fresh and salt water inputs is enhanced \ndur ing the warm season. Considering that the fieldwork along the estuarine gradient was \nconducted during late spring, the patterns of bacterioplankton abundance and activity are \nprobably biased by the seasonal preponderance of marine influences.  \n\nThe transition from the river to the main body of the estuary at the upper end of \nCanal de \u00cdlhavo was characterised by a marked change in the characteristics of \nbacterioplankton communities, both in terms of size and of activity rates. The pattern of \nincreasing abundance, potential peptide degradation and monomer uptake with decreasing \nsalinity was interrupted between the two inner stations of the profile (I8 and Rio Boco). \nHowever, in spring tide, the strong marine influence associated to flood current produced a \nmarked increase in salinity along the profile and extended the biological continuum to the \nupper station. Under different hydrological situations, total bacterial counts, rates of \nleucine-aminopeptidase (Leu-AMPase) activity and glucose uptake in Rio Boco were \nlower than in the adjacent estuarine section thereby confirming the mid-estuarine origin of \nthe densest and more active bacterioplankton populations. \n\nThe pattern defined by the longitudinal variation of ? -glucosidase (? -GLCase) \nactivity at the riverine interface was somewhat distinct. The highest activity rates were \nconsistently achieved at Rio Boco indicating that in the Ria, like in other coastal systems, \n\n\n\nDiscussion and conclusions \n \n\n 108 \n\n? -GLCase activity was negatively related to salinity (Murrell et al., 1999). It also indicates \nthat the relative importance of carbohydrates as substrate sources decreased seawards. On \nthe contrary, salinity played a minor role in the regulation of Leu-AMPase activity. The \nmaximum rates of Leu-AMPase activity were always higher than the maximum rates of  \n? -GLCase as it also happens in other coastal and estuarine environments (Rath et al., 1993; \nChristian and Karl, 1995; Murrel et al., 1999). The shift in the pattern of polymer \nutilisation that occurred along the estuarine gradient was expressed as an increase of the \nratio Leu-AMPase:? -GLCase. This ratio was 9-33 at the riverine interface and 35-48 at the \ninterface with the sea. Changes in the relative importance of different ectoenzymes occur \nwithin estuarine gradients and reflect a change in the spectra of available substrates \n(Schulz Jr and Ducklow, 2000). Therefore, the transition from carbohydrate- utilising to \nprotein- utilising communities was interpreted as an indication of the variation in the \ncomposition of the pool of utilizable organic matter between different estuarine sections.  \n\nThe rates of Leu-AMPase in the Ria were in the high range of the values found in \nother estuarine and coastal waters (Hoppe, 1983; Rego et al., 1985; Hoppe et al., 1998). \nThe exceptional potential for peptide degradation ma y result from the high anthropogenic \ninputs associated to the main body of the lagoon but may also reflect the utilisation of \norganic compounds as sources of nitrogen. The bacterioplankton of the Ria does not \nstrictly depend upon phytoplankton primary production for carbon supply (Almeida* et al., \naccepted) but may strongly compete with the dense phytoplankton communities for \nnitrogen (Chin-Leo and Benner, 1992). The high rates of peptide degradation may indicate \nthat combined amino acids are intensely utilised as organic sources of nitrogen by the \nbacterioplankton of the Ria.  \n\nThe variation of the rates of bacterioplankton-associated activities at the interface \nwith the sea conducted to a consistent pattern of increase during ebb and decrease during \nflood tide. Along the longitudinal profile the tidal fluctuation of the variables describing \nheterotrophic activity was more pronounced than the fluctuation of cell abundance, \nreinforcing the non-conservative behaviour of planktonic bacteria during tidal transport.  \n\nThe hypothesis that bacterial communities respond to changing water properties by \nshifting between levels of activity within time scales compatible with tidal effects \noriginating the characteristic longitudinal patterns of activity, was tested in laboratory. The \nuse of diffusion chambers allowed the assessment of the degree of environmental \nregulation of activity rates by reciprocally exposing bacterial assemblages from different \nestuarine sections to contrasting water properties. Activity rates of the tested communities \nmarkedly shifted within the 6-hour exposure periods whereas bacterial abundance \n\n\n\nDiscussion and conclusions \n \n\n 109 \n\nremained fairly stable. The results for ectoenzymatic activity (Leu-aminopeptidase and ? -\nglucosidase), glucose incorporation and biomass production after transference of the \nmarine bacterial community to brackish water showed maxima in the range of 241-384 % \nof the control values. The opposite transference of the brackish-water bacterial community \nto marine water produced maximal decreases to 0.14-0.58 % of the control values. There \nwas a concomitant increase in the CTC-active fraction of the marine community \ntransferred to brackish water and a decrease in the proportion of active cells in the brackish \nwater community transferred to marine water (Almeida et al., 2001). This indicates that \nchanges in total activity rates correspond to the superimposition of the variation of the size \nof the active fraction of the total community and of the activity levels of individual cells \nprobably by shifting between enzymatic systems with distinct kinetic characteristics \n(Unanue et al., 1999). \n\nEctoenzymatic activities were less affected by the experimental shifting in water \nproperties, in coherence with the results obtained in the field, along the estuarine gradient \nand during tidal cycles at the interface with the sea. The parameters describing the \nheterotrophic metabolism of glucose (Vm and Tr) were more reactive to tidal transport \nthan the potential rates of Leu-AMPase and ? -GLCase. Ectoenzymatic activity and \nmonomer uptake reflect different metabolic processes and are differently controlled by the \navailability and quality of the pool of organic matter. The higher degree of reactivity of the \nuptake of monomers may indicate that the proportion of low molecular weight substrates \nwithin the DOM pool may vary significantly between the mid and outer sections of the \nestuary. \n\n \n \n\nMajor factors of regulation of bacterioplankton activity in Ria de Aveiro \n\n \nTemperature and phytoplankton standing stocks were two of the major identified \n\nsources of variability of bacterioplankton heterotrophic activity. The combined influence \nof temperature, chlorophyll concentration and salinity explained ~80 % of the geographic \nvariability of bacterial abundance. However, the contribution of these factors to the \nvariability of parameters of bacterial activity was rather modest. The metabolic indicators \nrelated to monomer uptake, which were identified as the more reactive to environmental \npressure, were not significantly associated to salinity or phytoplankton biomass, and \ntemperature could not explain more than ~30 % of total variability. Under constant \ntemperature, monomer uptake exhibited the strongest responses to experimental changing \n\n\n\nDiscussion and conclusions \n \n\n 110 \n\nof water. The control of bacterial activity in diffusion chamber experiments was restricted \nto the dissolved water properties supporting the thesis that bacterioplankton reactivity in \nthe Ria is probably determined by short term variations of salinity and, in a major extent, \nby the size and composition of the DOM pool. \n\nPhytoplankton standing stocks were positively associated with bacterioplankton \nabundance and efficiency of glucose incorporation. However, during the warm season, the \nsecondary production of bacterial biomass is not limited by photosynthesis. In fact, \nbacterial carbon demand corresponded to ~20 % of the primary production in the water \ncolumn determined in late spring (Almeida* et al., accepted). The low dependence of \nbacterioplankton on autochthonous primary production and the high availability of organic \nsubstrates for bacterial growth during late spring and summer can also be inferred by the \nuncoupling between polymer degradation and monomer uptake. Maximum rates of glucose \nand leucine incorporation correspond respectively to 1-13 % of the ? -GLCase and  \n0.01-14 % of the Leu-AMPase associated supply of monomers, in terms of carbon. The \nuncoupling between phytoplankton primary production and bacterial secondary production \nas well as between polymer hydrolysis and monomer uptake occurs at high nutrient \nconcentrations (Middelboe et al., 1995; Hoppe et al., 1998) and was interpreted as a \nconsequence of the high degree of eutrophication of the Ria during the warm season. \n\nParticulate organic matter inputs are sometimes related to high rates of bacterial \nactivity in shallow environments (Chr\u00f3st and Riemann, 1994) and estuarine turbidity \nmaxima correspond to sections of elevated contribution of bacterial to total plankton \nbiomass and organic matter degradation (Fuks et al., 1991). No clear turbidity maximum \ncould be defined within the high biological activity section corresponding to the  \n20-30 PSU range. However, the resuspension of bottom sediments and the particle- loaded \nrunoff from the mud flats had been previously vented as on of the possible determinants of \nthe dramatic increase of turbidity and of the high microbial activities and relatively low \nprimary production in low tide (Hoppe et al., 1996). The field approaches failed to \ndemonstrate significant relations between POC concentrations and bacterioplankton \nheterotrophic activities. The fraction of particle-attached bacteria varied between 4 and  \n33 % of the total number, with no significant relation with either POC or chlorophyll. The \nrelative contribution of attached cells (> 1,2 \u00b5m) to ectoenzyme activities was highly \nvariable ranging from ~0 to 98 % of total Leu-AMPase and from ~0 to 83 % of ? -GLCase. \nPositive relations of bacterioplankton abundance and activity to phytoplankton biomass in \nthe absence of clear relations with particulate sources of organic matter suggests that the \n\n\n\nDiscussion and conclusions \n \n\n 111 \n\ncontrol is either exerted through algal exudates or that it corresponds to a parallel response \nof phyto- and bacterioplankton communities to gradients of inorganic nutrients. \n\nNo clear vertical or transversal patterns of POC or chlorophyll could be defined at the \nshallow fine-sediment mid-section of Canal de \u00cdlhavo suggesting a minor contribution of \nlocal sediment resuspension and runoff to the supply of particles to the water column, \nunder a slow tidal current regime. The indication that POM plays a secondary role in the \nregulation of bacterioplankton metabolism is coherent with laboratory evidence for the \npreponderance of dissolved factors in the reactivity of bacterial communities towards \nenvironmental variability. The advection of simple orga nic substrates at benthic and littoral \ninterfaces, by density displacement of interstitial water (Webster et al., 1996), may account \nfor considerable inputs of DOM to the water column and contribute to the high rates of \nactivity in shallow biotopes (von Bodungen et al., 1995) such as those prevailing in Ria. \n\n \n \n\nThe importance of biological processes in the water column in the context of a shallow \nestuarine system \n\n \nFor the assessment of the relative contribution of the water column to the total system \n\nmetabolism it is important to consider that the estuarine system of the Ria de Aveiro has an \naverage depth of 1 m, that the shallow section (&lt;3m) correspond to ~95 % the high tide \nwet area (estimated from Silva, 1994) and that the sediments are generally characterised by \nbacterial densities 3 orders of magnitude superior to those observed the water column \n(Alc\u00e2ntara et al., 1996).  \n\nThe magnitude of planktonic processes, standardised to surface units, exhibits a \nhigher degree of short-term variability than that of the benthic compartment because of the \ntidal variation of depth. The sediments of the Ria are 9-71 times more active in organic \nmatter aerobic mineralization than the water column, in a per volume unit basis (Alc\u00e2ntara \net al., 1996). However, the plankton accounts for 66-90 % of the total oxygen consumption \nper surface unit at sub-tidal areas. The contribution of bacteria to oxygen consumption, \neither in the plankton or in the benthos, was not established. In sediments, the contribution \nof microorganisms to total oxygen consumption tends to decrease towards shallower \nbiotopes (Piepenburg et al., 1995). Sulphate reduction seems to be the major pathway for \norganic carbon mineralization in shallow sandy sediments whereas denitrification gains \nrelevance in finer and deeper sediments (Rysgaard et al., 2000). The major contribution to \noxygen consumption in estuarine waters is associated&lt;1 \u00b5m size classes (Griffith et al., \n\n\n\nDiscussion and conclusions \n \n\n 112 \n\n1990) but bacterial growth efficiency decreases with increasing eutrophication (del Giorgio \nand Cole, 1998). In the conditions of the Ria, and considering the evidences for the high \navailability of organic matter in the water column, an important contribution of \nbacterioplankton for total respiration should be expected.  \n\n \n \n\nBiogenic fluxes between the estuary and the sea \n \nThe patterns of organic matter utilisation along the estuarine gradient and the \n\nreactivity of heterotrophic bacterioplankton at the interface with the sea are major \ndeterminants of the impacts of the Ria on adjacent coastal waters. \n\nConsiderable amounts of labile DOC can be exported from estuaries where the \nresidence time is short when compared to organic matter turnover time (Raymond and \nBauer, 2000). The residence time estimated for the mid and inner sections of Canal de \n\u00cdlhavo varies with season but generally corresponds to several weeks (Silva, 1994). In \nthese conditions, the lability of organic substrates may considerably decrease with \nincreasing proximity to the sea. Bacteria reaching the outer section of the estuary respond \nto higher salinity and to lower substrate quality by shifting to activity levels that are lower \nthan expected by conservative dilution. On the contrary, a more favourable environment \nreactivates communities entering the estuary during flood tide.  \n\nThe balance of the tidal exchange of water between the estuary and the ocean \ncorresponded to a net seaward flux of bacterial cells and associated activities. The biogenic \nexports from the Ria to the sea persisted even during periods of net retention of marine \nwater.  \n\n \nUnanswered questions  \n\n \nTwo important aspects of the regulation of bacterioplankton activity in the estuarine \n\nsystem of the Ria de Aveiro could not be satisfactorily clarified.  \nThe first refers to the role of DOM in the regulation of the processes of polymer \n\nhydrolysis and monomer uptake. The characterization of the DOM in terms of major \nestuarine sources, range of concentrations, spectra of compounds and bioavailability, as \nwell as the evaluation of the relative importance of DOM and POM in the supply of \nnutrients for bacterioplankton growth are emerging investigation areas that will provide \nnew insights into the dynamics of heterotrophic estuarine bacterioplankton.  \n\n\n\nDiscussion and conclusions \n \n\n 113 \n\nThe second aspect regards the co-existence of distinct communities highly adapted to \nthe prevailing conditions at extreme sections of the estuary and the possibility that shifts in \nthe levels of activity may correspond to changes in community composition. The \nexperimental exposure to contrasting water properties revealed the plastic behaviour of \nmixed communities suggesting a high degree of environmental modulation of the \nexpression of bacterial activities. However, the distinct reversibility of the effects caused \nby exposure to contrasting water of marine and brackish water communities may be \ninterpreted as an indication of the existence of communities with different tolerance to \nsalinity. The genetic characterization of the bacterioplankton communities of the Ria by \nculture- independent techniques would certainly bring decisive information on the subject. \n\n \n \n\nConclusions  \n\n \nThe planktonic compartment is the major contributor to the aerobic degradation of \n\norganic matter in the sub tidal areas in the shallow estuarine system of the Ria de Aveiro. \nAlthough the Ria comprehends extensive areas of shallow channels and intertidal zones \n(salt marshes and mud flats) the resuspension of bottom sediments and the run off from \nintertidal zones appeared to play a minor role in the regulation of bacterial processes in the \nwater column. \n\nThe bacterial component of the plankton responded intensely and within short-time \nintervals to shifts in environmental factors and the establishment of a clear longitudinal \npattern of variation resulted from the reactivity of the expression of heterotrophic activity \nrates during tidal transport. The main body of the estuary, corresponding to the 20-30 PSU \nrange, showed the highest bacterial abundance and heterotrophic potential for the \nectoenzymatic degradation of polymers and for the uptake of monomers.  \n\nThe levels of heterotrophic activity of bacterioplankton decreased at both riverine and \noceanic boundaries, more than expected from conservative dilution, therefore confirming \nthe reactive nature of bacterial metabolism in the highly unstable estuarine interfaces. \nThere was also a shift in the patterns of organic matter utilization from a C-dependent \nmetabolism at the less saline sections to an increasing relevance of N-dependence towards \nthe outer section. \n\nLaboratory experiments demonstrated that the environmental regulation of the \nactivity of natural bacterial assemblages from contrasting estuarine sections is mainly \n\n\n\nDiscussion and conclusions \n \n\n 114 \n\nexerted through dissolved factors being salinity and substrate availability two of the main \nsources of variability. \n\n\n\nReferences \n \n\n 115 \n\n \nReferences \n \nAbreu S. and Duarte A.
