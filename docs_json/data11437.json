Many soil\nand management factors, such as temperature, mechani-\ncal resistance, aeration, texture, water and nutrient avail-\nability, pH, frequency and depth of tillage, mulching and\norganic matter content, affect root distribution of grape-\nvines (Kirchhof et al., 1991; Morlat &amp; Jaquet, 1993;\nRichards, 1983). In addition, root functionality is variable\n\nand depends on the grapevine cultivar or rootstock (Perry\net al., 1983; Nagarajah, 1987; Morano &amp; Kliewer, 1994).\nRegarding water supply to roots, the type of irrigation\nsystem has been shown to affect root distribution (Morano\n&amp; Kliewer, 1994) as influenced by irrigation frequency,\nsoil water availability, and spatial distribution of water\nand nutrients (Araujo et al., 1995; Clothier &amp; Green,\n1997; van Zyl, 1988). Moreover, actual root water uptake\nnot only depends on root distribution and its functioning,\nbut also on soil water availability and salinity. In addi-\ntion to water stress in periods of low water availability,\nroot water uptake is also reduced when concentrations of\n\n\n\nBassoi et al.378\n\nScientia Agricola, v.60, n.2, p.377-387, Abr./Jun. 2003\n\nsoluble salts exceed plant-specific threshold values\n(Homaee, 1999). In irrigated soils, particularly in arid and\nsemi-arid regions, plants are generally exposed to both,\nsalinity and water stress. In these regions, soil and water\nmanagement practices are based on maintaining a favor-\nable soil water content and salinity status in the root zone,\nthereby minimizing periods of water stress while control-\nling leaching to minimize salinity stress. Furthermore,\nthere is an increasing interest in the influence of soil water\nstress on grape and wine qualities (Bravdo &amp; Hepner,\n1987; Freeman, 1990; Matthews &amp; Anderson, 1988;\nMyburgh, 1994; van Zyl &amp; van Huyssteen, 1984). These\nissues, in combination, justify studying the interrelation-\nships between irrigation water management, root distri-\nbution grape, yield and quality.\n\nGrapevine root growth initiates after bud burst\nand growth rates increase rapidly to a maximum at the\nblooming stage, after which the growth rate decreases.\nHowever, a new growth period starts after harvest (van\nZyl, 1988).  Depending on age, structural roots vary in\ndiameter but are usually between 6-100 mm. From the\nmain framework, smaller permanent roots (diameter 2-6\nmm) arise and grow either horizontally or vertically.\nThese roots extend and branch in a few main extension\nroots that are generally thin (diameter 1-2 mm) and grow\nrapidly. These finer roots die within weeks after emer-\ngence but are replaced continuously (Richards, 1983).\n\nRoot distribution refers to the presence of roots\nwithin a fixed grid. Typically, root distribution studies in-\nclude root biomass or root length as a function of soil\ndepth, distance from the plant stem, and position between\nneighboring plants. Measurement of root distribution in\nagricultural communities often includes roots of more\nthan one plant. Root architecture refers to the spatial con-\nfiguration of the root system, specifically focusing on the\ngeometric properties of root axes and laterals, mostly con-\ncerned with the entire root system characteristics (Lynch,\n1995). Image analysis may provide all required informa-\ntion on root distribution and architecture, allowing for an\nexplicit characterization of water and nutrient exploration,\ncomparisons between plant cultivars and soil and water\nmanagement practices.\n\nRoot analysis as a tool to study root behavior may\nbenefit from using a combination of various measurement\nmethods (Atkinson, 1980). Although root distribution\nanalysis by the monolith method is difficult, laborious and\ntime-consuming (Bohm, 1979), it provides detailed infor-\nmation on root length and diameter within a soil profile.\nDespite the fact that finer roots are more likely involved\nin plant water uptake, evidence has been presented that\nthe larger suberized roots can also be effective in water\nand nutrient acquisition (Kozinka, 1991; van Zyl, 1988).\nHowever, because of uncertainties about the relationship\nof root diameter to their function, generally, the root\nlength within a soil volume unit has been adopted (root\n\nlength density, Lv) to characterize root presence (Klepper,\n1992). In the trench or profile wall method (Bohm, 1979),\ndigital image analysis can provide information for the re-\nquired quantitative root analysis. From the digital pictures\nof roots exposed in a trench wall, root area (Ap) and root\nlength (Lp) can be estimated using an image processing\ntechnique (Crestana et al., 1994). Moreover, root biom-\nass can be determined from root area measurements, as\nsuggested by Ruark &amp; Bockhein (1988) in aspen roots\nanalysis in trench walls. Many other studies have shown\nthe feasibility, accuracy and procedures of digital image\nanalysis to estimate root area, root length and root diam-\neter (Bauhus &amp; Messier, 1999; Commins et al., 1991;\nDowdy et al., 1998; Kaspar &amp; Ewing, 1997; Kimura et\nal., 1999; Murphy &amp; Smucker, 1995; Tagliavini et al.,\n1993).\n\nThe objectives of this study were to analyze root\ndistribution of grapevines, and to determine root distri-\nbution as affected by irrigation methods and soil types.\nSpecifically, differences in root characteristics were\nmeasured for microsprinkler and drip irrigation systems\nfor the IAC-313 rootstock in Petrolina, PE, Brazil. For\nthis purpose, both the soil profile method with digital\nimage analysis (Crestana et al., 1994; Bassoi et al.,\n1999) and the monolith method (Bohm, 1979) were\nused. In another commercial grape growing area located\nin Juazeiro, BA, Brazil, an evaluation of root distribu-\ntion of the same rootstock in a different soil type was\nalso conducted, using the trench method only. Both\nneighboring counties are sited along the S\u00e3o Francisco\nRiver and are important table grape production areas of\nthe S\u00e3o Fancisco Valley of the semi-arid region of north-\neastern Brazil.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nPetrolina County\nTwo field trials were carried out in Petrolina, PE,\n\nBrazil (09\u00b0 09\u2019 S, 40\u00b0 22\u2019 W, altitude 365.5 m). The re-\ngion has characteristics to grow grapevine with two har-\nvests a year, because of the warm temperatures that pre-\nvail throughout the year (Ara\u00fajo, 1994). The grapevines\ncv. Italia grafted on the rootstock IAC-313 were planted\nin September 1991 in a 4 x 2 m grid (rows x plants) on\na Typic Acrustox of average bulk density 1.6 Mg m-3.\nThe soil is classified as medium-textured (140 g kg-1,\n80 g kg-1 and 780 g kg-1 of clay, silt and sand, respec-\ntively), and the average soil water retention corresponds\nto 128.4 g kg-1 and 44.9 g kg-1 at 10 kPa and 1500 kPa,\nrespectively. The chemical characteristics of the soil pro-\nfile (Table 1) were determined down to the 1 m depth\nas described by EMBRAPA (1997). Grapevines were ir-\nrigated either by microsprinkler (flow rate of 40 L h-1\n\nwith a wetting radius of 2 m), spaced every 4 m along\nthe plant row and centered between two plants, or by\n\n\n\nGrapevine root distribution 379\n\nScientia Agricola, v.60, n.2, p.377-387, Abr./Jun. 2003\n\ndrip emitters  (flow rate of 3.7 L h-1), spaced 1 m apart\nalong a double drip line (10 cm distance between plant\nrow and drip lines on either side of the grapevines). Ir-\nrigation scheduling was based on pan-A evaporation\ndata, using crop coefficients obtained in 1994 in the\nsame area (Teixeira et al, 1999), and identical daily wa-\nter application amounts were used for both irrigation\nsystems. Root distribution was measured after bloom-\ning in two subsequent growing seasons, using the soil\nprofile method combined with digital image analysis\n(Crestana et al., 1994; Bassoi et al., 1999) and the mono-\nlith method (Bohm, 1979).\n\nSoil profile method\nFor crops on both irrigation systems, 1-m deep\n\nand 2-m wide trenches were dug between plant rows to\nexpose half of the root system of each of the two grape-\nvine plants, in October 1995 and for other two in April\n1996 (2 m long wall, one plant along each side of the\ntrench). The distance between trench wall and center of\nplant row was 1 m.\n\nA thin layer of soil (1-2 cm) was carefully re-\nmoved from the excavated vertical soil wall along the\nwhole trench, and visible roots (generally with diam-\neter larger than 1 mm) were painted with white ink to\nenhance color contrast of the roots and the soil. A 1 \u00d7\n1 m wire-wood frame with a wire grid of 0.2 \u00d7 0.2 m\nwas pressed against the trench wall and video images\nwere collected for each of the 0.04 m2 areas along the\nwhole trench. The image collection procedure was re-\npeated in several distances (1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, and 0.2\nm) from plant row. Root images were digitized with a\nresolution of 640 x 480 pixels, saved as BMP files and\nprocessed by the Integrated System for Root and Soil\nCoverage Analysis (SIARCS\u00ae) software (Crestana et\nal., 1994). From each image, root areas (Ap, m\n\n2) were\ndetermined.  Average Ap values ( pA ) were computed\nfrom  two subsequent trench walls, e.g., making up\nthe front and back of each 0.2 m thick soil slab, corre-\nsponding to distances of 0.2-0.4, 0.4-0.6, 0.6-0.8, and\n0.8-1.0 m from the plant row.\n\nTable 1 - Chemical characteristics of the soil of Petrolina and Juazeiro trials.\n\nE.C.: electric conductivity; O.M.: organic matter\n\nhtped Hp .C.E P .M.O aC +2 gM +2 aN + K + lA+H lA 3+ V\n\nm mSd 1- mdgm 3- mdg 3- lomm--------------------------\nc\n\nmd 3- -------------------------- ---%---\n\n5991relknirpsorcimanilorteP\n2.0-0 2.6 33.0 701 69.0 5.2 0.2 20.0 6.0 0.3 5.0 36\n\n4.0-2.0 2.6 94.0 69 16.0 6.2 4.1 20.0 6.0 4.2 5.0 66\n6.0-4.0 1.5 48.0 39 35.0 4.2 5.1 30.0 5.0 8.3 0.2 45\n8.0-6.0 4.4 37.0 - - 4.1 6.1 30.0 5.0 7.4 5.8 34\n0.1-8.0 2.4 75.0 - - 6.1 7.1 30.0 4.0 1.5 5.01 24\n\n5991pirdanilorteP\n2.0-0 5.6 12.1 711 37.0 3.2 7.1 30.0 6.0 8.1 5.0 27\n\n4.0-2.0 0.6 78.0 321 55.0 9.2 0.1 30.0 6.0 6.1 5.0 47\n6.0-4.0 4.5 81.1 49 74.0 6.2 1.2 50.0 6.0 6.2 0.1 76\n8.0-6.0 6.4 91.1 - - 4.3 0.1 50.0 6.0 4.2 5.2 86\n0.1-8.0 4.4 94.1 - - 7.2 1.2 50.0 5.0 9.2 5.3 56\n\n6991relknirpsorcimanilorteP\n2.0-0.0 5.4 78.0 73 62.1 9.0 6.0 20.0 2.0 1.4 0.3 13\n4.0-2.0 7.4 57.0 96 45.1 7.1 5.0 20.0 3.0 6.4 0.4 43\n6.0-4.0 3.5 47.0 95 50.1 0.2 2.1 20.0 4.0 5.3 5.1 05\n8.0-6.0 0.5 19.0 38 49.0 6.2 0.1 30.0 5.0 9.2 5.1 85\n0.1-8.0 4.5 75.1 96 36.0 0.3 8.1 11.0 7.0 6.1 0.1 87\n\n6991pirdanilorteP\n2.0-0.0 0.5 36.0 87 93.1 0.2 9.0 50.0 3.0 3.3 5.1 05\n4.0-2.0 9.4 65.0 69 90.1 7.1 5.0 20.0 3.0 9.3 0.2 93\n6.0-4.0 5.4 96.0 721 88.0 8.1 2.1 30.0 3.0 9.4 0.4 14\n8.0-6.0 2.5 09.0 97 19.0 6.2 3.1 50.0 4.0 5.0 0.1 98\n0.1-8.0 6.5 03.1 23 60.1 4.3 2.1 90.0 6.0 5.1 5.0 87\n\n7991worruforiezauJ\n2.0-0.0 0.7 66.0 021 69.1 6.7 7.0 70.0 6.0 0.0 0.0 001\n4.0-2.0 7.6 27.0 46 89.0 9.6 2.2 40.0 6.0 4.1 1.0 78\n6.0-4.0 6.6 93.0 61 17.0 9.6 2.1 50.0 5.0 5.1 1.0 58\n8.0-6.0 6.6 82.0 - - 1.8 5.2 50.0 3.0 6.1 1.0 78\n0.1-8.0 5.6 13.0 - - 2.8 1.2 70.0 3.0 2.1 1.0 09\n\n\n\nBassoi et al.380\n\nScientia Agricola, v.60, n.2, p.377-387, Abr./Jun. 2003\n\nMonolith method\nAfter image collection of each trench wall, mono-\n\nliths of 0.008 m3, corresponding to the 0.2 \u00d7 0.2 m imaged\narea and to the 0.2 m soil thickness, were sampled for two\nplants, in 1995 and 1996. As the trenches were excavated\nbetween two plant rows, sampling was performed on root\nsystems on each side of the trenches. Monoliths were col-\nlected at distances of 1.0-0.8, 0.8-0.6, 0.6-0.4, and 0.4-0.2\nm from plant rows. In the field, the roots of the monoliths\nwere carefully separated from the soil using a 4 mm mesh\nsieve. Subsequently, fresh roots were washed in the labo-\nratory, classified in four diameter (d) intervals: d ? 2 mm,\n2 &lt;d ? 5 mm, 5 &lt;d ? 10 mm, and d > 10 mm, and oven\ndried at 65\u00b0C before counting. For each diameter interval,\ndry weight (Dw, g) and root length  (L, m) was estimated\nusing the line intersection method (Tennant, 1975). Grid\nsizes of 0.01 x 0.01 m and 0.02 x 0.02 m were used for\ncounting root line intersections for d ? 10 mm and d > 10\nmm, respectively. Root length density (Lv, m m\n\n-3) was ob-\ntained from the estimated L divided by the monolith vol-\nume (V = 0.008 m3).\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe root parameters (Dw, pA  and Lv) for the two\n\nirrigations systems were analyzed in relation to four dis-\ntance intervals from plants, and five soil depths using a\nrepeated measure design. As measurements were repeated\nover the soil profile, the root count at one depth (soil layer\n0.2 m thick) is not independent of the root count of the\nnext depth, for a homogeneous soil. So counts over sev-\neral depths were considered repeated spatial measure-\nments (Morano &amp; Kliewer, 1994). For each irrigation sys-\ntem, two replications were sampled and analyzed for Dw,\n\npA  and Lv data of 1995 and 1996.\nTo better understand the relationships between root\n\nmeasurements, pA - was calculated from the front and the\nback sides of a monolith - was correlated with Dw and Lv,\nobtained from the inside of the same soil volume. Values\nof Dw, Lv, and pA  were added over each 0.2 m soil depth\nand along the trench wall, and  fractional distributions of\nroot parameters were also correlated. These comparisons\nwere performed for all distance intervals and for both irri-\ngation systems.\n\nModel application\nA simple model to predict the vertical root dis-\n\ntribution was applied to root parameters measured by\nboth, the trench wall and monolith methods, based on an\nasymptotic equation (Gale &amp; Grigal, 1987): Y = 1 \u2013 (BD),\nwhere Y is the cumulative fraction of a root density pa-\nrameter (between 0 and 1) measured from soil surface to\na depth D (m), and B is a fitting coefficient.\n\nJuazeiro County\nIn a separated field experiment in 1997, the root\n\ndistribution of the grapevine cv. Piratininga, grafted on\n\nthe rootstock IAC-313, was measured using the soil pro-\nfile method combined with digital image analysis, to dem-\nonstrate its application in a farmer\u2019s field. Grapevines\nwere planted in 1990 using a 3.5 x 2 m spacing, in a\nclayey soil (540 g kg-1, 90 g kg-1, 370 g kg-1 of clay, silt\nand sand, respectively), and with a bulk density of 1.4\nMg m-3). Average soil water retention at 10 kPa and 1500\nkPa were 19.6 g kg-1 and 10.3 kg-1, respectively. Chemi-\ncal characteristics of this soil (Table 1) were also deter-\nmined as described by EMBRAPA (1997). Vines were ir-\nrigated using furrows on each side of the vine row. Two\ntrenches (1 m deep and 2 m long) were excavated to ex-\npose the rooting system of one vine trunk in the center\nof each trench. Field procedures for image collection were\nthe same as described earlier. Root distribution was ana-\nlyzed at several distances (1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, and 0.2 m)\nfrom the trunk. In addition the Ap, root length in the soil\nprofile (Lp, m) was measured in this trial. Average val-\nues ( pA  and pL , respectively) were obtained from two\nsubsequent trench walls as described in the Petrolina\nCounty experiment. In addition, root length density data\nwere computed from the images, assuming that the volu-\nmetric root fraction (VRF, m3 of roots per m3 of soil) is\nequal to the areal root fraction (ARF, m2 of roots per m2\n\nof soil), and that the total root volume within each 0.2 x\n0.2 x 0.2 m3 bulk soil volume is equal to ? 2r?  pL  (Bassoi\net al., 1999):\n\nVRF = ARF => (? 2r?  pL ) / (0.2 \u00d7 0.2 x 0.2) = pA  / (0.2 \u00d7 0.2)\n\npL  = ( pA  \u00d7 0.2) / (?\n2r? )\n\nL\nv,p\n\n = pL  / (0.2 \u00d7 0.2 \u00d7 0.2) = ARF / (? 2r? )\n\nwhere Lv,p denotes the root length density as estimated\nfrom the soil profile method (m m-3), and r?  (m) is the\naverage root radius as estimated by the (Ap / Lp) ratio of\nboth images of the 0.008 m3 root  volume (both trench\nfaces).\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nPetrolina County\nA considerable variation on the total value\n\n(whole plant) of Dw and L was observed between the\ntwo grapevines in both years, even on a same irrigation\nsystem. In 1995, total Dw values were 1.23 and 0.34 kg\nfor microsprinkler, and 1.03 and 0.71 kg for drip irri-\ngated plants. Corresponding total L values were 473.5\nand 252.5 m for microsprinkler, and 475.8 and 417.2 m\nfor drip irrigated plants. In 1996, total Dw from vines\nirrigated by microsprinkler were 1.36 and 0.46 kg, while\nfor those irrigated by drip values were 0.84 and 1.06 kg.\nRespectively, total L values were 564.5 and 264.2 m for\nmicrosprinkler, and 396.8 and 506.0 m for drip irrigated\nplants. In both years, roots with d ? 5 mm were approxi-\n\n\n\nGrapevine root distribution 381\n\nScientia Agricola, v.60, n.2, p.377-387, Abr./Jun. 2003\n\nmately 50 % or more of total Dw, while roots with d ? 2\nmm corresponded to at least 80 % of total L. Other stud-\nies have shown that most of the roots were found within\nd &lt;0.5 mm (van Zyl, 1988), d &lt;1 mm (Morlat &amp;\nJacquet, 1993), and d &lt;2 mm (Morano &amp; Kliewer,\n1994; Padjett-Johnson, 1999). The variation is possibly\na consequence of the extension and direction of root\ngrowth, which is predominantly a random phenomenon\ninfluenced by gravity, soil resistance, temperature and\navailability of carbohydrate from the leaves, nutrient and\nwater availability and gaseous exchange within the soil\n(Rowe, 1993). Also, strong spatial heterogeneity of root\ndistribution, volumetric root expansion, frequent asym-\nmetry on either side of plant rows, and a great variabil-\nity in root diameter are the main constraints for root\nstudies in vineyards (Morlat &amp; Jacquet, 1993). The av-\nerage L for drip (448.93 \u00b1 50.64 m) was higher than\nthat of microsprinkler-irrigated plants (388.70 \u00b1 155.05\nm), which is similar in relation to other results (Stevens\n&amp; Douglas, 1994). Variability of total root length of\nvines did not make possible any conclusion on the ef-\nfect of soil texture on root development (Nagarajah,\n1987).\n\nThere were no differences between root param-\neters under both irrigation systems while all comparisons\nwere significant between soil profiles, soil depths and\ntheir interactions. The closer to the trunk, the greater is\nthe amount of roots in the horizontal direction, as well\nas in the vertical direction. Dw was not significant for ir-\nrigation and soil profile interaction in 1995, and for irri-\ngation and soil depth interaction in 1996, while Lv and\n\npA presented significant differences for both years (Table\n2).\n\nIn the horizontal direction (irrigation and soil pro-\nfile interaction), the t-test was significant for root param-\neters in some sites. For the most distant samples from\ntrunk (0.8-1 m), Dw and pA  of the microsprinkler-irri-\ngated grapevines presented higher values (except for pA\nin 1995), while near the trunk (0.2-0.4 and 0.4-0.6 m),\ndrip-irrigated plants presented significant higher root pa-\nrameters. In the vertical direction (irrigation and soil\n\ndepth interaction), soil layers until 0.6 m presented some\nroot parameters with higher values for plants irrigated by\ndrip, and some higher values for plants irrigated by\nmicrosprinkler for the deeper soil layer (Table 3).\n\nIn the significant interactions between irrigation\nand soil profile and soil depth, the t-test between the\nsame soil depth interval in the same soil profile indi-\ncated that few portions of the root system had differ-\nences between both irrigation systems. But for those\nwith differences, this occurred at the greatest distance\nfrom the trunk (0.8-1 m soil profile) and in the deepest\nsoil layer (0.8-1 m depth); microsprinkler-irrigated\nplants presented greater root presence than those irri-\ngated by drippers, in almost all sampling sites. A clear\ntendency of greater values of drip irrigated plants ap-\npeared in the upper 0.6 m soil depth and in the soil pro-\nfiles between 0.2 and 0.6 m. Lv and pA  values of 1996\ntrial are presented over the entire trench walls in verti-\ncal and horizontal directions in Figures 1 to 4. Closer\nto the trunk, values increased as well as the ones under\nmicrosprinkler presented higher values than those un-\nder drip irrigation in 0.8-1 and 0.6-0.8 m soil profiles,\nwhile the opposite occurred for 0.4-0.6 and 0.2-0.4 m\nsoil profiles. Higher values of Lv and pA  were found\nnear the soil surface due to manure application, a com-\nmon practice of the grapevine production system in the\nS\u00e3o Francisco Valley. Generally, table grape growers\nhave been applying 0.02-0.04 m3 of manure per vine in\nevery growing season.\n\nAs grapevine root distribution in the soil profile\nis dependent of edaphic conditions (Nagarajah, 1987;\nMorlat &amp; Jacquet, 1993). Soil depth of highest root pres-\nence varied around 0.4 m (Nappi et al., 1985), 0.5 m\n(Padgett-Johnson, 1999), 0.8 m (Stevens &amp; Douglas,\n1994), 1.0 m (Ara\u00fajo et al., 1995), and 2.4 m (Williams\n&amp; Smith, 1991). Some of the influence factors are the ir-\nrigation system, age of the plant, rootstock, spacing grid,\nand physic-chemical soil conditions. In this study, the\nupper 0.4 m soil profile presented the highest amount of\nroot in both soils. Supposedly application of mamure has\nprovided better root proliferation conditions in this soil\n\nTable 2 - Analysis of variance (P &lt;0.05) with a repeated measurement design of root dry weight (Dw, kg), root length density\n(Lv, m m\n\n-3), and root area ( pA , m2) of the grapevine cv.

Higher grapevine root presence in a sandy soil ho-\nrizon was observed and related to higher organic matter\ncontent (Morlat &amp; Jacquet, 1993). The main factors for\nshallow rooting in tropical soils are low pH, high exchange-\nable aluminum, compaction, inadequate aeration, and low\nretention and movement of water (Reichardt, 1981). In this\nstudy, soil pH ranged from 4.4 (deeper to upper layers) to\n6.0 (upper layers), and organic matter content in deeper lay-\ners was low. Also, this soil presented over the 1 m depth\nlow level of sodium, medium levels of calcium and mag-\nnesium, high contents of potassium and phosphorus, and\nmedium base saturation (Table 1).\n\nStevens &amp; Douglas (1994) found that in the hori-\nzontal direction, roots of drip-irrigated plants were con-\ncentrated under the vine row, and 50% of the root length\nwas within the 45 cm distance from the plant row in com-\nparison with 35% of the plants irrigated by\nmicrosprinkler. A decrease in the grapevine root length\nfrom 0.3 m to 0.9 m distance from the trunk was also ob-\nserved by Nagarajah (1987). In this study area, a greater\namount of roots was within the 0.6 m distance from the\nplant row.\n\nWater application by drippers close to the trunk\nprovides smaller wetted soil volume mainly in the closer\n\nTable 3 - Comparison performed by the t-test (P &lt;0.05) between drip and microsprinkler irrigation systems of root dry\nweight (Dw, kg), root length density (Lv, m m\n\n-3), root area ( pA , 10\n-4 m2) of the grapevine rootstock IAC-313 from\n\nsignificant interactions between irrigation versus soil profile and irrigation versus soil depth, for Petrolina.\n\npA\n\npA\n\npA\n\npA\n\nFigure 1 - Lv - root length density - (a,b \u2013 m m\n-3) and pA  \u2013 root area (c,d \u2013 10\n\n-4m2) distributions in the 0.8-1 m soil profile under drip (a,c)\nand microsprinkler (b,d) irrigation systems in Petrolina.\n\n\n\nGrapevine root distribution 383\n\nScientia Agricola, v.60, n.2, p.377-387, Abr./Jun. 2003\n\nsoil portions at vertical and horizontal directions to trunk.\nTherefore, in some portions of the soil near the trunk, Lv\nand pA  were higher for drip than for the correspondent\npositions in plants irrigated by microsprinklers. But root\ngrowing was spread over the longitudinal direction in re-\nlation to the plant rows, because of the 2 m wetting ra-\ndius of the microsprinklers, emitter disposals on each 1\nm along the drip line, and the manure application, close\nand along plant rows. Besides of the differences on meth-\nods used for root sampling and measurement, Lv values\nare in accordance with other authors (Nagarajah, 1987;\nvan Zyl, 1988).\n\nNormal precipitation (1963-1996) at Petrolina,\nmeasured at the climatic station located within the ex-\nperimental area, was 573 mm per year, and 512 mm oc-\n\ncur between November and April (rainy season). As\ngrapevine is cultivated over the entire year in this tropi-\ncal fruit growing area, with two harvests per year\n(Araujo, 1994), the root growth during the rainy sea-\nson may contribute also to minimize differences in root\ndevelopment under microsprinkler and drip irrigation\nsystems.\n\nCorrelations obtained between Dw, Lv and pA\nfor 1996 data were slightly better than those for 1995,\nbut in both years the r2-values were not sufficiently\nhigh, even those between parameters measured inside\nthe monolith. This occurred because the trench wall ex-\nposes part of the root system present inside the soil\nvolume, and because roots with same Dw may have dif-\nferent L values or vice-versa because of different root\n\nFigure 3 - Lv  - root length density (a,b \u2013 m m\n-3) and pA  \u2013 root area (c,d \u2013 10\n\n-4m2) distributions in the 0.4-0.6 m soil profile under drip (a,c)\nand microsprinkler (b,d) irrigation systems in Petrolina.\n\nFigure 2 - Lv - root length density (a,b \u2013 m m\n-3) and pA  \u2013 root area (c,d \u2013 10\n\n-4m2) distributions in the 0.6-0.8 m soil profile under drip (a,c)\nand microsprinkler (b,d) irrigation systems in Petrolina.\n\n\n\nBassoi et al.384\n\nScientia Agricola, v.60, n.2, p.377-387, Abr./Jun. 2003\n\ndiameter. Correlation performed between the averaged\nfractional distribution of the root parameters for each 0.2\nm soil layer along the trench wall, considering each\nplant and each soil profile, were high. The integration\nof the root parameter values provided this better rela-\ntionship (Table 4). It means a good correspondence and,\ntherefore, a support to the feasibility of the digital im-\nage analysis for this purpose.\n\nThe model to predict vertical root distribution\nwas tested with Dw, Lv, and pA  measured in 1996\n\nin two vines irrigated by microsprinkler for all soil\nprofiles together (Figure 5). The variability of the\nvalues for a same soil depth is attributed to the varia-\ntion of root presence in the different distances from the\ntrunk, as already discussed. The equations presented high\nr2 values, and the Dw, Lv, and pA variances were explained\nby 91.3, 89.5, and 95.2 %, respectively. Therefore, the\nvertical root distribution analysis can be accomplished\nusing the parameters measured by both methods with this\nsimple model, with acceptable accuracy.\n\nTable 4 - Linear equations (y = a + bx), correlation coefficients for root dry weight (Dw, kg), root length density (Lv, m m\n-3),\n\nroot area ( pA , m2), and root length ( pL , m) of the grapevine rootstock IAC-313, and their fractional distribution\ncomparisons in Petrolina (1995 and 1996) and Juazeiro (1997).\n\nraey setanidrooc noitagirri retemarap noitubirtsidlanoitcarf\n\nyx metsys a b r2 a b r2\n\n5991 D\nw\n\nLx\nv\n\norcim 898.461 548.51 265.0 492.3 538.0 558.0\n\npird 569.381 669.12 416.0 572.3 638.0 619.0\n\nD\nw\n\nx orcim 4-E305.3 5-E713.3 714.0 540.5 847.0 896.0\n\npird 4-E752.2 5-E196.4 646.0 777.2 168.0 968.0\n\nL\nv\n\nx orcim 5-E426.9 6-E296.1 995.0 386.3 618.0 447.0\n\npird 4-E480.1 6-E841.1 665.0 350.1 749.0 378.0\n\n6991 D\nw\n\nLx\nv\n\norcim 518.371 563.91 295.0 881.4 197.0 968.0\n\npird 613.071 051.32 427.0 613.5 437.0 668.0\n\nD\nw\n\nx orcim 4-E652.5 5-E624.6 206.0 324.3 928.0 319.0\n\npird 4-E053.5 5-E744.7 366.0 263.6 286.0 147.0\n\nxvL orcim 4-E332.2 6-E042.2 786.0 011.1 449.0 649.0\n\npird 4-E081.1 6-E157.2 387.0 826.0 969.0 398.0\n\n7991 x worruf 798.0 27.2922 858.0 053.4 387.0 869.0\n\nLx\np,v\n\nworruf 947.93 44.39174 535.0 704.9 035.0 547.0\n\nLx\np,v\n\nworruf 877.42 613.91 585.0 834.6 876.0 177.0\n\npA\n\npA\n\npA\n\npA\npL\n\npL\n\npA\n\npA\n\nFigure 4 - Lv - root length density (a,b \u2013 m m\n-3) and pA  \u2013 root area (c,d \u2013 10\n\n-4m2) distributions in the 0.2-0.4 m soil profile under drip (a,c)\nand microsprinkler (b,d) irrigation systems in Petrolina.\n\n\n\nGrapevine root distribution 385\n\nScientia Agricola, v.60, n.2, p.377-387, Abr./Jun. 2003\n\nJuazeiro County\nRoot distribution of the grapevine cv. Piratininga\n\ngrafted on rootstock IAC-313 was evaluated by digital\nimage analysis to obtain pA , pL , and Lv,p, and an ex-\nample of these results is presented for pA  in Figure 6\nfor comparison with results from the experimental area\n(Petrolina County). Roots reached the 1 m depth and the\n1 m distance from the trunk and the amount increased in\nrelation to the decrease of the distance from the plant row.\nThis soil presented a higher pH and nutrient content than\nthat of Petrolina (Table 1). The lack of roots near soil sur-\nface, specially in 0.4-0.6, 0.6-0.8, and 0.8-1 m distances,\ncan be attributed to no manure application in this area.\nA much less fine root proliferation was observed in the\nfield, particularly in the 0-0.4 m depth, as compared to\nthe Petrolina County trial.\n\nAs observed for the experimental area, higher\ncorrelation coefficients were obtained with the fractional\ndistribution correlation than with the parameter compari-\nsons (Table 4). Lv calculated by monolith data in the ex-\nperimental area ranged from 10 to 2730 m m-3, while Lv,p\n(using trench wall data) of the Juazeiro County trial var-\nied from 1 to 930 m m-3. The differences in magnitude\nbetween both root parameters are a consequence of the\nwhole and partial exposure of the roots for measurement\n(respectively, L in the monolith method, and Ap and Lp\nin the soil profile method). In an indirect way, we found\nthat fractional Lp and Lv,p may be used to evaluate root\ndistribution, given their correlation with pA .\n\nThe range of root diameter over the trench wall\nand estimated by Ap/Lp ratio was 2.1 - 3.4, 2.1 - 3.3, 2.2\n- 3.7, 1.9 - 2.7, 0.9 - 2.9 mm, for soil profiles at 0.2, 0.4,\n\nFigure 6 - pA - root area (10-4 m2) distribution over 0.8-1 (a), 0.6-0.8 (b), 0.4-0.6 (c), and 0.2-0.4 m (d) soil profiles in Juazeiro.\n\nFigure 5 - Vertical root distribution based on the model Y = 1-(BD) of Dw (root dry weight), Lv (root length) and pA  (root area) measured\nin all soil profiles of two vines irrigated by microsprinklers in Petrolina (1996).\n\n\n\nBassoi et al.386\n\nScientia Agricola, v.60, n.2, p.377-387, Abr./Jun. 2003\n\n0.6, 0.8, and 1 m from plant rows. These estimations are\nwithin the diameter intervals where most of Dw and L\nwere found in the Petrolina County and by other studies\nalready mentioned.\n\nIn conclusion, the grapevine cv. Italia, grafted on\nthe rootstock IAC-313 and grown under drip and\nmicrosprinkler irrigation, presented a root system that\nreached 1 m in the vertical and horizontal directions from\nthe trunk, in a coarse textured soil. However, much of the\nroot system was present in the soil volume covered by\nthe 0.4 m depth and by the perpendicular distance of 0.6\nm from plant row. In some portions of the soil, root\namounts were higher as the distance from the trunk in-\ncreased (vertical and horizontal directions) for plants un-\nder microsprinkler irrigation, while drip irrigated grape-\nvines presented higher root presence near to the trunk.\nRoots with diameter less than 2 mm were at least 80%\nof the total root length.\n\nCorrelation among dry weight, root length den-\nsity and root area were reasonable, but correlation among\ntheir fractional distributions over the soil profile were\nhigher, which lead to similar conclusions on root distri-\nbution. Because of its good correlation with root length\ndensity, root area or root length estimated by the soil pro-\nfile method combined with digital image analysis can be\nused to evaluate grapevine rootstocks.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nTo CNPq for finantial support (project n\u00b0 521376/\n95-5).\n\nREFERENCES\n\nARAUJO, F.J.
