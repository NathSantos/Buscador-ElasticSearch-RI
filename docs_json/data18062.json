The first part is devoted to the analytical study\n\nof the structure of premixed flames within porous inert media, covering a wide range\n\nof equivalence ratios. The second part is devoted to the construction of a level-set\n\nmodel for multidimensional numerical simulations of porous burners.\n\nThe structure of stationary adiabatic lean premixed planar flames within porous\n\ninert media is investigated using the asymptotic expansion method based on three\n\ncharacteristic length-scales. The non-equilibrium between the phases and the inter-\n\nphase heat transfer are analyzed in each scale and simplifying hypothesis are assumed.\n\nThe models developed result in closed form solutions for the solid- and gas-phase tem-\n\nperatures, fuel and oxidant mass fractions and flame propagation velocity. The results\n\nalso predict (qualitatively) the lean flammability limit and the maximum superadia-\n\nbatic temperature for lean mixtures.\n\nThe analytical results were used to construct a microscale (subgrid) model for\n\nthe flame speed to be used in the simulation of three-dimensional flow and reaction\n\nin porous media. The problem is formulated with a simplified form of the volume-\n\naveraged conservation equations (macroscale model) using the G-equation (level-set\n\nmethod) to describe the movement of the flame front. A 1D version of the model\n\nis implemented to illustrate the method, showing reasonable agreement with a con-\n\nventional model based on the solution of the full set of conservation equations. The\n\nadvantage of the proposed method is the smaller CPU times required to achieve\n\nconvergence.\n\nxi\n\n\n\nNomenclature\n\nA Pre-exponential factor, m3(kg s)?1\n\nAgs interphase surface area , m\n2\n\na Temperature exponent (reaction rate expression), -\n\ncp Specific heat at constant pressure, J(kg K)\n?1\n\nD Mass diffusion coefficient, m2 s?1\n\nDa Damko?hler number, -\n\nDa Modified Damko?hler number of the O(???1) problem, -\n\nd Dimensionless flux in the reaction region, -\n\nEa Activation energy, J mol\n?1\n\nf Body force, m s?2\n\nG Nonreactive scalar, -\n\nH Excess enthalpy function, -\n\nhv Volumetric convection heat transfer coefficient, W(m\n3 K)?1\n\nhi Enthalpy of species i, J kg\n?1\n\nI?

Then, the difficulties for the numerical simulations of practical\n\ndevices are discussed. Finally, the objectives of the thesis are stated and an overview\n\nof the monograph is given.\n\n1.1 The combustion in porous media and its ap-\n\nplications\n\nThe focus of this thesis is on the stationary adiabatic combustion of premixed gases\n\nwithin porous inert media. In these burners, the flame front stabilizes within the\n\nthree-dimensional structure of interconnected cavities that forms the solid matrix.\n\nWhen compared to freely propagating flames, flames in porous media are character-\n\nized by the existence of an enhanced heat transfer from the hot region downstream\n\nfrom the flame to the cold region upstream from the flame due to a local form of heat\n\nrecirculation. This characteristic has received much attention in the last decades as\n\na way of extending flame stability and burning fuel lean mixtures [3, 4, 5].\n\n1\n\n\n\n2\n\nThe heat recirculation from the combustion products is broadly used in recuper-\n\native and regenerative burners to increase the flame temperature. Weinberg [6] and\n\nLloyd and Weinberg [7] proposed original ways to control the amount of heat recir-\n\nculated to the incoming reactants and, consequently, the flame temperature. With a\n\nthermodynamic model, Hardesty and Weinberg [8] showed that the amount of heat\n\nprovided by the heat recirculation produces an excess enthalpy at the flame, which\n\nin turn extends the flammability limits of the fuel and increases the combustion rate.\n\nIn an experimental study, they used a burner with an integrated counter-flow heat\n\nexchanger between the combustion products and the incoming air. This burner was\n\nable to burn mixtures of very low heat content, showing that the excess enthalpy\n\nallows the stabilization of flames that would not burn otherwise. They also showed\n\nthat the maximum flame temperature exhibited by these flames is not determined by\n\nthe reactants stoichiometry only, but also by the amount of heat recirculated.\n\nTakeno and Sato [9] demonstrated numerically that the insertion of a porous\n\nmedium in the flame region recreates Weinberg\u2019s conditions to recirculate the heat\n\nfrom the outcoming hot combustion products to the incoming fresh reactants and\n\nproduces excess enthalpy flames. They showed that in these systems the heat re-\n\ncirculation induced by the porous medium adds to the heat released by combustion\n\nresulting in local temperatures in excess of the adiabatic flame limit based on the ini-\n\ntial conditions of the mixture. This has been called superadiabatic combustion [10].\n\nIt is important to note that this recirculation of heat differs from the conventional\n\nrecuperation of heat from the combustion products as proposed by Weinberg and his\n\nco-workers. In flames within porous media, the heat recirculation occurs at the flame\n\nscale and no external heat transfer devices are required.\n\n\n\n3\n\nFigure 1.1: SiC foam porous burner [1].\n\nFigure 1.1 shows a picture of a porous burner made of SiC foam in operation with\n\nthe reactants flowing upward. The flame is not visible since it is stabilized within\n\nthe porous matrix. The hot solid-phase loses heat to the surroundings by thermal\n\nradiation.\n\nFigure 1.2 shows a scheme of the working principle of the steady-state combustion\n\nin a porous inert medium with heat losses at the ends. The gas-phase enters the\n\nporous medium and is preheated by the hot solid-phase. At the flame position, the\n\ngas-phase temperature increases steeply due to the heat released by the combustion\n\nreactions, reaching its maximum value. From this point ahead the gas-phase is hotter\n\nthan the solid-phase and the surface convection heat transfer is established from the\n\n\n\n4\n\ngas-phase to the solid-phase. As a consequence of the temperature gradient across\n\nthe solid-phase, heat is recirculated from the hot side of the solid matrix to its cold\n\nside by the solid-phase conduction and intramedium radiation. As a result of this\n\nlocal recirculation of heat, the flame temperature may exceed the adiabatic limit.\n\nFigure 1.2: Gas-phase (Tg) and solid-phase (Ts) temperatures and mass fraction of\nfuel (YF ) distributions for the steady-state combustion in a porous inert medium\nwith heat losses at the ends. The heat fluxes q?u, q?k and q?r are respectively the\nconvection, conduction and radiation heat fluxes, q?ku is the interphase heat transfer\n(surface convection), q?rec is the heat recirculation, which includes the conduction and\nradiation through the solid-phase, and s?r is the reaction energy conversion.\n\nSince the pioneer work of Takeno and Sato [9], many researchers have turned\n\ntheir attention to the field of combustion in porous inert media. Experimental and\n\nnumerical investigations were performed covering a variety of aspects. The experi-\n\nmental works aimed to characterize the operation of surface and volumetric burners\n\nin terms of the flame stability, turn-down-ratio, pollutants emission and flammability\n\n\n\n5\n\nlimits [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Howell et al. [3] provide a longer list of earlier refer-\n\nences. The measurement of the local thermal non-equilibrium between the phases is a\n\nproblem particularly difficult to deal with because of the access restrictions to sensor\n\nprobes within the solid matrix, the influence of the radiation field in the local temper-\n\nature measurements and the possible catalytic reactions that may occur at the sensor\n\nsurface. Some authors have proposed strategies to overcome these difficulties [12, 15],\n\nreaching limited success. Recently, the first optical measurement of temperature and\n\nspecies in a porous medium burner has been reported [18]. Nevertheless, the perspec-\n\ntives of this technique are still restricted to specific matrixes in which the structure\n\npermits optical access. Finally, some studies have also focused on the determination of\n\ntransport properties for materials and conditions of interest to combustion in porous\n\nmedia such as effective thermal conductivity [19, 20], surface convection coefficient\n\n[21, 22] and radiant properties [23]. The numerical investigations are reviewed in the\n\nnext section.\n\nAs a consequence of its modified flame structure, the combustion in porous media\n\nhas several advantages over the free-flame combustion. The high temperatures at the\n\nreaction region lead to high reaction rates and, consequently, high flame speeds and\n\nhigh densities of energy release, allowing for the development of small burners. The\n\nelevated temperatures at the reaction region also permit the combustion of fuels of\n\nlow heat content or mixtures that are under the standard lean flammability limit, i.e.,\n\nthe combustion of fuels and mixtures that otherwise would not be flammable. The\n\nhigh temperatures also lead to high efficiencies in the conversion of the reactants to\n\nsaturated products, reducing the emissions of CO and unburned hydrocarbons. For\n\nvery lean mixtures, the flame temperatures are low enough to prevent NOx formation.\n\n\n\n6\n\nFurthermore, the increase in the flame speed also reduces the residence time in the\n\nhotter regions of the flame, reducing the NOX emissions even for near-stoichiometric\n\nmixtures [14]. The solid matrix enhances the thermal inertia of the burner, making\n\nit less sensitive to fuel feed fluctuations. Finally, the hot solid matrix can enhance\n\nthe heat transfer by radiation between the burner and the load. The heat transfer\n\nby radiation can provide much faster heating times than the surface convection heat\n\ntransfer because it depends on the forth power of the temperature of the burner and\n\nthe load and is not limited by a thermal boundary layer. Then, the use of porous\n\nradiant burners can speed-up the processes that depend primarily on surface heat\n\ntransfer, for example, reducing the necessary length of industrial kilns and dryers.\n\nThese attractive characteristics lead to the development of several industrial and\n\ndomestic applications. Compact boilers with high efficiencies where developed based\n\non the combustion in porous media (CPM) technology [24, 25]. Units, comprising\n\nburner and heat exchanger, of the order of 10-15 times smaller than the existing free-\n\nflame based units were reported. The hight power density of flames in porous media\n\nhave lead to the development of compact heating systems for household applications\n\n[24, 26]. The hight power modulation range of these burners makes them adequate to\n\ndeal with the discrepancies between the power requirement of environment heating\n\nand hot water production. This characteristic avoids the need of several burner start-\n\nup and warm-up periods during the day, where the highest emissions occur.\n\nThe need of using fuels of low heat content had also lead to the development\n\nof applications of the CPM technology. The rising cost of oil and the tendency of\n\nsubstituting fossil-fuels by renewable sources is increasing the interest in gas fuels\n\ngenerated by pyrolysis processes of many sources (coal, organic waste, biomass etc.),\n\n\n\n7\n\nwhich are known as syngas (synthetic gas), and gases emitted by landfills. The syngas\n\nmay be composed by CO, H2 and CH4 diluted in a mixture of N2, CO2 and H2O,\n\nwhereas municipal waste landfills emit mainly CO2 and CH4. In all theses cases the\n\nproportion between the constituents of the mixture may vary strongly depending on\n\nthe source. If the fuel is very diluted with inert gases, the lean mixtures formed\n\nrepresent a challenge for conventional free-flame burners due to the low flame tem-\n\nperatures and poor flame stability. Numerical and experimental studies show that\n\nthe combustion in porous media is a suitable technical solution to this application\n\nbecause of its ability to burn lean mixtures, to its wide power turn-down-ratio and\n\nimproved flame stability [27, 28].\n\nThe study of liquid fuel combustion in porous inert media has also been ad-\n\ndressed [29, 30, 31]. In general, these studies have been concerned with a dispersion\n\nof liquid fuel droplets suspended in air within the porous media. In this case, the\n\nthree-dimensional structure of interconnected cavities of the solid matrix provides a\n\nradiation field that enhances the liquid vaporization, leading to high power loads.\n\nRadiant porous burners are probably the most widespread devices based in the\n\nCPM technology. In these burners, the flame is stabilized at the surface of the porous\n\nmatrix (surface burners) or within the matrix (volumetric burners). The hot solid-\n\nphase exchanges energy with the surrounding environment through radiation heat\n\ntransfer. These burners found applications in paper and wood drying, powder coating,\n\nplastic curing and forming and food browning and baking [1, 3].\n\nSurface burners are suited to the development of ultra-low NOx burners. When\n\nthese burners operate in the radiant mode, the flame is stabilized at the surface of\n\nthe burner. The surface heat loss to the surroundings cools the flame and lowers the\n\n\n\n8\n\nNOx emissions [32]. The conversion efficiency of CO and HC can be kept high, even\n\nat low flame temperatures, with the addition of catalytic particles to the solid matrix\n\n[33, 34]. The porous matrix is an appropriate substrate to catalytic particles since,\n\nin general, it has a large surface area to volume ratio (m2/m3).\n\nThe more general case of traveling combustion waves through porous media is\n\nknown as filtration combustion (FC). Based on this process, efficient boilers were\n\ndeveloped using the concept of reciprocating combustion [35]. In these boilers, the\n\nflow is reversed periodically, enhancing the heat recuperation of the device. Studies\n\nof filtration combustion in porous inert media show that a proper flow rate can lead\n\nto an overlap of the combustion and thermal waves, which in turn leads to extremely\n\nhight excess temperatures at the reaction region [36, 37]. In these cases, ultra-lean\n\nmixtures (? ? 0.1) become flammable.\n\nHydrogen production through partial oxidation within porous inert media has\n\nbeen investigated in experimental and numerical studies of forward filtration com-\n\nbustion [38, 39]. The high superadiabatic temperatures reached in these burners are\n\nadequate to the thermal cracking and partial oxidation of fuel rich mixtures.\n\nMujeebu and co-workers [40, 41, 42] and Mo?\u00dfauer et al. [26] discuss several de-\n\nvices where combustion in porous medium is employed, including gas turbine and\n\npropulsion, thermoelectric conversion, powder combustion, highly polluting volatile\n\norganic components (VOC) oxidation, micro and meso-scale applications, air-heating\n\nsystems for dryers, compact heating systems for cars, lightning and HCl synthesis.\n\nThe numerical simulation of practical devices, like those discussed above, presents\n\nseveral challenges. In the next section, some difficulties of numerical simulations\n\nof realistic devices are discussed with special attention devoted to radiant burners\n\n\n\n9\n\napplications.\n\n1.2 Challenges for the numerical simulation.\n\nComputational models for the simulation of combustion in porous media require the\n\nsimultaneous solutions of chemical kinetics, mass, thermal energy and momentum\n\nequations. The multi-scale nature of the combustion process imposes difficulties in\n\nsolving these equations because the reactions take place in a characteristic length scale\n\nthat is much thinner than the characteristic length scale of the thermally affected re-\n\ngion in the porous matrix. The mesh resolution required to solve the reaction region\n\nis much more restrictive than that to solve the large-scale problem. Local mesh re-\n\nfinement at the flame can reduce the computational demand, but complex adaptative\n\nalgorithms to track the flame front are needed. Regarding the kinetic mechanism, an\n\nopen question that still remains is the proper temperatures and concentrations that\n\nshould be used to evaluate the reaction rates, since the volume-averaged values of\n\nthese variables are valid approximations just for small departures from equilibrium\n\n[4].\n\nNumerical works, in general, are based on one-dimensional homogeneous models\n\n(volume-averaged), and aim to understand the flame stabilization mechanisms, the\n\ninfluence of transport properties and chemical kinetics on the flame structure, tran-\n\nsient behaviors and many other aspects [43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48]. Multidimensional\n\nsimulations were reported [49, 50], but in these cases the computational effort is a\n\nlimiting aspect. Direct simulations are also found, but their application is restricted\n\nto simplified geometries [44, 51].\n\n\n\n10\n\nWhen dealing with engineering applications, such in radiant burners, some ad-\n\nditional difficulties may arise. Each application requires different solutions in terms\n\nof power, operational temperature and burner shape. The burner must be designed\n\nto operate under the matrix maximum operational temperature to prevent matrix\n\ndegradation. Intense gradients should be avoided in ceramic foam burners to increase\n\nthe matrix durability [52]. The stability range and radiant efficiency of these burners\n\ndepend on the burner configuration and the heat losses, then, the flame behavior un-\n\nder each operational condition changes. As a consequence, it is necessary to introduce\n\nnew burner designs to face different applications.\n\nOne example of the possible complexities that can arise from the applications\n\nis the use of multiple discrete injection points of the reactant mixture at the inlet\n\nsurface of radiant porous burners. This configuration creates a combined thermal and\n\nfluidynamic mechanism of flame stabilization, leading to an enlarged stability range\n\nwhich is specially interesting when burners with large superficial area are needed [2].\n\nIn these burners, at each injection point is associated a cone like flame configuration\n\nsimilar to the one observed in [50]. These multiple individual flames can merge\n\ndepending on the operational conditions. Figures 1.3 and 1.4 show respectively a\n\nphotograph and infrared image of a 15 cm x 15 cm radiant burner with 11 points of\n\ninjection distributed in the inlet surface of the burner [2]. The injection points are\n\nclearly seen as brighter spots. This solution permits the development of a variety of\n\nburner configurations, aiming at surface homogeneity of temperature or staged power\n\nsupply.\n\nThen, the multiple scale nature of the problem, the stiffness and nonlinearity of\n\nthe chemical reaction terms, combined with the nonlinearity of the flow in porous\n\n\n\n11\n\nFigure 1.3: Porous radiant burner with multiple injections [2].\n\nmedia and the 3D geometries involved, bring difficulties in building useful design\n\ntools to the development of new burners because of the large computational effort\n\ninvolved. Simplified models that could predict the most important thermal aspects\n\nof the combustion within porous media, with reduced computational effort, would be\n\nof great interest for engineering applications.\n\nResearchers have focused their attention on developing new schemes to solve freely\n\npropagating premixed flames in a less expensive way than the traditional approach of\n\nsolving the entire set of conservation equations. For example, the level-set approach\n\nbased on the G-equation with a modeled turbulent flame velocity has been used to de-\n\nscribe turbulent premixed combustion in the flamelet regime [53, 54]. In these models\n\nthe flame inner structure is not solved explicitly and all information of the reaction\n\nscale is grouped in the flame velocity expression. An alternative approach to include\n\n\n\n12\n\nFigure 1.4: Infrared thermographic image of a porous radiant burner with multiple\ninjections [2].\n\ndetailed kinetics is presented in [55, 56]. In this model (flamelet-generated-manifold\n\n- FGM) a higher dimensional flame is considered as an ensemble of one-dimensional\n\nflames. The results of the simulations of the 1D flamelet equations are parameter-\n\nized and stored in a manifold that is accessed in the course of the multidimensional\n\nflame calculations. This technique has been applied to solve for the 3D gas flow and\n\nreaction above a surface radiant porous burner in a confined ambient [57].\n\nThe use of the level-set method with the G-equation in combination with an an-\n\nalytical expression for the flame velocity could be an interesting way of predicting\n\nthe main thermal aspects of the combustion in porous media and of building a useful\n\ndesign tool for porous burners with complex three-dimensional shapes. The idea is\n\nto use a macroscopic volume-averaged model to describe the problem of heat trans-\n\nfer between the gas and solid phases at the largest scale (macroscale model) and a\n\n\n\n13\n\nsubgrid model for the local flame consumption speed (microscale model) as a form of\n\nmultiscale treatment for reaction in porous media [58].\n\n1.3 Objectives\n\nThe objective of this thesis is to develop a model for multidimensional numerical\n\nsimulations of premixed flames within porous inert media capable of capturing the\n\nmain thermal characteristics of the processes with an associated low computational\n\ncost.\n\nThis general objective will be divided in two partial objectives:\n\n1. To analyze the premixed flame structure in porous inert media with the aim of\n\nidentifying possible simplifications for the inner scales of the problem.\n\n2. To develop a level-set treatment for the simulation of flow and reaction in\n\nporous media based on a subgrid model for these inner scales.\n\n1.4 Organization of the manuscript\n\nChapter 2 presents the problem formulation for reacting flows within porous inert\n\nmedia, discusses its main difficulties and proposes simplifications to allow the analytic\n\ntreatment.\n\nChapters 3 to 5 are devoted to the analytical study of the structure of lean sta-\n\ntionary adiabatic planar premixed flames within porous inert media, covering a wide\n\nrange of equivalence ratios. Chapter 3 deals with an asymptotic solution for the\n\ncombustion of near-stoichiometric mixtures, where high flame velocities are found\n\n\n\n14\n\nand where the interphase heat transfer at the inner scales of the problem can be\n\nneglected. This study has been published recently [59]. Chapter 4 is devoted to\n\nultra-lean mixtures with low flame velocities, where the interphase heat transfer at\n\nan intermediate scale can not be neglected, and reveals the lean flammability limit for\n\npremixed combustion in porous inert media. Finally, Chapter 5 uses an alternative\n\nformulation of the conservation equations through the excess enthalpy function and\n\nreveals a limit for the superadiabatic effect. This study has been presented partially\n\nat the 12th Brazilian Congress of Thermal Engineering and Sciences November 10-14,\n\n2008, Belo Horizonte, MG.\n\nChapter 6 is devoted to the construction of a level-set model for multidimensional\n\nnumerical simulations of porous burners. The flame velocity expression found in the\n\ntheoretical analysis is adapted as a subgrid model for the flame propagation in porous\n\nmedia and is used in conjunction with the G-equation (level-set method) to model\n\nthe flame surface movement.\n\nFinally, in Chapter 7, the main conclusions are summarized followed by recom-\n\nmendations for future works.\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nProblem formulation\n\nIn this chapter, the volume averaging method is employed to obtain the homogeneous\n\nconservation equations for the problem of a reactive gas-phase flowing through a\n\nstationary inert solid-phase. Questions concerning the applicability of the model\n\nto the problem of combustion in porous inert media are discussed and simplifying\n\nhypothesis are assumed.\n\n2.1 Local problem\n\nConsider a mixture of reacting gases flowing through the interstices of a solid station-\n\nary matrix as shown in figure 2.1. The solid-phase is chemically inert and impermeable\n\nto the fluid-phase. The conservation of the total mass of the gas-phase reads\n\n??g\n?t\n\n+ ?\u00b7 (?gu) = 0, (2.1)\n\nwhere ?g is the gas-phase density and u is the gas-phase velocity vector. The conser-\n\nvation of mass of the chemical species, assuming the validity of the Fick\u2019s law [60, 61],\n\n15\n\n\n\n16\n\nFigure 2.1: The local problem of a reacting fluid-phase flowing through a stationary\ninert solid-phase.\n\nreads\n\n?g\n?Yi\n?t\n\n+ ?gu \u00b7?Yi = ?\u00b7 (?gDim?Yi) + w?r,i, (2.2)\n\nwhere Yi is the mass fraction of the chemical species i, Di,m is the mass diffusivity of\n\nthe species i into the mixture and w?r,i is the homogeneous volumetric rate of reaction\n\nof species i. The thermal mass diffusion (Soret effect) is neglected.\n\nThe energy conservation equations for the solid and gas phases are written assum-\n\ning Fourier\u2019s law of heat conduction. For the gas-phase we have\n\n(?cp)g\n?Tg\n?t\n\n+ (?cp)g u \u00b7?Tg = ?\u00b7 (?g?Tg)\n\n?\nNs?\ni=1\n\n?gYicp,ivi,diff \u00b7?Tg ?\nNs?\ni=1\n\nhiw?r,i, (2.3)\n\nwhere Tg is the gas-phase temperature, cp,g is the specific heat at constant pressure\n\nfor the gas-phase, ?g is the molecular thermal conductivity of the gas-phase, Ns\n\nis the number of chemical species, cp,i is the specific heat at constant pressure of\n\n\n\n17\n\nspecies i, vi,diff is the diffusion velocity of species i in the mixture, which is given\n\nby vi,diff = ?(Dim/Yi)?Yi and hi is the specific enthalpy of species i. The kinetic\n\nenergy and viscous dissipation heating are neglected. The gas-phase radiation is, in\n\ngeneral, negligible when compared to the solid-phase radiation. For the solid-phase\n\nwe have\n\n(?cp)s\n?Ts\n?t\n\n= ?\u00b7 (?s?Ts) , (2.4)\n\nwhere Ts is solid-phase temperature, (?cp)s is the product of the density and spe-\n\ncific heat at constant pressure for the solid-phase and ?s is the molecular thermal\n\nconductivity of the solid-phase.\n\nThe momentum conservation equation (Navier-Stokes) for a compressible flow is\n\n[62]\n\n?g\n\n(\n?u\n\n?t\n+ u \u00b7?u\n\n)\n= ?gf ??p + ?(??\u00b7 u) + ?\u00b7\n\n{\n\u00b5\n[\n?u + (?u)T\n\n]}\n, (2.5)\n\nwhere f is a body force, p is the thermodynamic pressure, \u00b5 is the dynamic viscosity\n\nof the gas-phase, ? is the second coefficient of viscosity and (?u)T is the transpose\n\nof the tensor ?u.\n\nFor closure, the ideal gas equation is used\n\np =\nRu\nMg\n\n?gTg, (2.6)\n\nwhere Ru is the universal gas constant and Mg is the mixture molar mass (Mg =?N\ni=1 XiMi, where Xi and Mi are respectively the molar fraction and molar mass of\n\nspecies i).\n\nThe boundary conditions at the interface (Ags) between the solid and gas phases\n\nare: (1) impermeable solid with no surface reactions and no-slip conditions,\n\n??gDi,j?Yi = 0 and u = 0 on Ags, (2.7)\n\n\n\n18\n\nand (2) continuity of temperature and heat flux\n\nTg = Ts and ?g?Tg \u00b7 n?gs = (??s?Ts ? q?r,s) \u00b7 n?sg on Ags, (2.8)\n\nwhere n?gs is the unitary normal vector on Ags pointing to the solid-phase (n?gs = ?n?sg\n\non Ags) and q?r,s is the radiant heat flux at the solid surface, that is due to the\n\nradiation exchange between solid surfaces. The gas-phase radiation at the pore-scale\n\nis neglected.\n\nThe solution of this entire set of equations requires the description of the geometric\n\ndetails of the solid matrix in a direct numerical simulation. This approach represents\n\na tremendous computational effort that is impractical, except for periodic structures.\n\nThe method of volume averaging can reduce this problem to a macroscopic description\n\nof an homogeneous medium with effective properties that is more easily solved. On\n\nthe other hand, this method requires some conditions for its validity that will be\n\ndiscussed in the next section.\n\n2.2 Volume averaging method\n\nIn this method, the conservation equations are volume-averaged over a representative\n\nelementary volume (REV), i.e., the smallest volume that represents the local average\n\nproperties. Thus, a small increase in the REV does not change the averaged proper-\n\nties. Figure 2.2 shows a rendering of the representative elementary volume and the\n\nposition vectors. Any point in the domain can be located by the position vector ~r in\n\nrespect to the global coordinate system. Then, we can define a volume of integration\n\n(REV) with geometric center (GC) located by an arbitrary position vector ~x. Now,\n\nany point inside the REV can be located by the local position vector ~y in respect to\n\n\n\n19\n\nFigure 2.2: The representative elementary volume and position vectors\n\nGC. The idea of the method is to average the property of interest in the REV, using\n\nthe local coordinate system ~y (microscopic coordinate), and to relate the result to\n\nthe general coordinate system ~x (macroscopic coordinate).\n\nThe volume average of a property ? is defined as [63]\n\n??? =\n1\n\nV\n\n?\nV\n\n?dV, (2.9)\n\nwhere V is the volume of the REV and ?? denotes the volume averaging. The porosity\n\nof the matrix ? is defined as\n\n? =\nVg\nV\n\n=\nVg\n\nVg + Vs\n, (2.10)\n\nwhere Vg and Vs are the gas- and solid-phase volumes inside the REV. Then, the\n\naverage of a gas-phase property ?g over the gas-phase volume (gas-phase intrinsic\n\n\n\n20\n\nvolume average) is\n\n??g?g =\n1\n\nVg\n\n?\nVg\n\n?gdV = ??g?/?. (2.11)\n\nThe theorem of the intrinsic volume-averaging of the gradient of a function ?g is\n\n???g?g = ???g?g +\n1\n\nVg\n\n?\nAgs\n\n?gdA. (2.12)\n\nAnalogously, the theorem of the intrinsic volume-averaging of the divergent of a vector\n\nbg is\n\n??\u00b7 bg?g = ?\u00b7?bg?g +\n1\n\nVg\n\n?\nAgs\n\nbg \u00b7 n?gsdA. (2.13)\n\nCentral to the volume averaging method is the requirement of scales separation,\n\nwhich can be stated as\n\nlp ? lREV ? L , (2.14)\n\nwhere lp is the pore characteristic length-scale, lREV is the characteristic length-scale\n\nof the REV and L is the largest characteristic length-scale of the problem. This\n\nprevents the analysis of thin media for which boundary effects are as important as\n\nbulk effects. Also, phenomenological scales have to be separated. For example, for\n\nconduction heat transfer, it is required that\n\n?Tlp ? ?TlREV ? ?TL, (2.15)\n\nwhere ?T represents the maximum temperature difference across the respective\n\nlength-scale. This condition represents a severe limitation to the volume-averaging\n\nmodelling of combustion in porous media. It is usually not possible to define a REV\n\nthat fulfils the separation of scales requirement since flames are characterized by a\n\nnarrow region where the fuel is consumed and the chemical energy is released (the\n\nflame thickness) that is often of the order of a fraction of the length-scale of a single\n\npore, which means that the leftmost inequality in equation (2.15) is violated.\n\n\n\n21\n\nA comparison between the direct simulation (2D) and the volume-averaged mod-\n\nels for the combustion in porous media is presented by Sahraoui and Kaviany [44].\n\nThe two-dimensional results show that multiple flame velocities exist as the flame is\n\ndisplaced within a pore, a behavior not predicted by homogeneous models. Addition-\n\nally, the flame temperature is under-predicted by the volume-averaged model. More\n\ndetails on the interaction of the flame with the pore walls at the pore level are found\n\nin Hackert et al.[51] and Daou and Matalon [64].\n\nNevertheless, if one assumes the validity of the volume-averaged model, the method\n\nproceeds with taking the volume average of the conservation equations (2.1) to (2.7)\n\nand applying successively the averaging theorems. For the total mass conservation\n\nequation, the application of the volume averaging gives?\n??g\n?t\n\n?g\n+ ?\u00b7??gu?g = ?\n\n1\n\nVg\n\n?\nAgs\n\n?gu \u00b7 n?gsdA. (2.16)\n\nApplying the Reynolds transport theorem to the transient term and using the imper-\n\nmeability and non-slip condition at Ags the result is\n\n???g?g\n\n?t\n+ ?\u00b7??gu?g = 0. (2.17)\n\nProceeding in the same way for the energy and species conservation equations,\n\ndifficulties arise because of the additional unknowns introduced by the method (terms\n\ninside the area integrals). To treat these terms spatial decompositions are proposed\n\nfor the variables in the form\n\n?g = ??g?g + ?\n?\n\ng, (2.18)\n\nwhere the ?\n?\ng is a local spatial deviation from the intrinsic phase-averaged value ??g?g.\n\nThe problem is closed proposing a set of closure constitutive equations that, in general,\n\n\n\n22\n\nrelate the local deviation of the variable to the gradient of its average\n\n?\n?\n\ng = b(x) \u00b7???g?\ng, (2.19)\n\nwhere b(x) is a vector function. For the two-medium model described here, these clo-\n\nsure constitutive equations include the effect of the gradients of the phase-averaged\n\ntemperatures of both phases as well as the differences in the phase-averaged temper-\n\natures of the phases [63]. Then, the several unknowns of the problem are grouped in\n\neffective coefficients that have to be modeled. As an example, the volume-averaged\n\ngas-phase energy equation obtained for the two-medium treatment is\n\n??Tg?g\n\n?t\n+ vgg \u00b7??Tg?g + vgs \u00b7??Ts?s = ?\u00b7 Dgg \u00b7??Tg?g + ?\u00b7 Dgs \u00b7??Ts?s\n\n+\nAgs\nVg\n\nhc\n(?cp)g\n\n(?Ts?s ??Tg?g) + ?s?r?g, (2.20)\n\nwhere the convective velocity vectors vgg and vgs are the coefficients of the terms\n\ncontaining the first-order derivatives, the total thermal diffusivity tensors Dgg and\n\nDgs are the coefficients of the terms containing second-order derivatives, hc is the\n\ninterfacial conduction heat transfer coefficient, that is independent from the fluid\n\nvelocity, and ?s?r?g is an energy source term. The equation for the solid-phase energy\n\nis similarly obtained. Note that many cross terms between the solid- and gas-phase\n\nenergy equations exist. The coefficients appearing in Eq. (2.20) are to be obtained\n\nfrom the solution of the closure problem.\n\nEquations for the transformation vectors (and scalars, in the case of the two-\n\nequation model) are obtained and numerical solutions for the closure problems are\n\nproposed by some authors [65, 66]. These solutions are based on direct numerical\n\nsimulations for idealized periodic structures. The results show the behavior of the\n\n\n\n23\n\neffective coefficients which can be parameterized and used in the volume-averaged\n\nconservation equations.\n\nThe derivation of the volume-averaged momentum conservation equation in a form\n\nequivalent to the Navier-Stokes equation is still an open problem. Some simplified\n\nforms are proposed in the literature [63].\n\nAs a result of the volume-averaging method, it is possible to arise at a set of\n\nvolume-averaged conservation equations that describes the problem of a reacting flow\n\nthrough a stationary solid matrix. Nevertheless, data of the entire set of effective\n\ncoefficients is very limited and the resulting equations are still too difficult to solve\n\nfor engineering problems. To deal with these difficulties, semi-heuristic equations that\n\nrely on the volume average concepts but cannot be derived from first principles are\n\nproposed. These equations will be reviewed in the next section.\n\n2.3 Semi-heuristic volume-averaged conservation\n\nequations\n\nThe volume-averaged conservation equations for the total mass, mass of species, gas-\n\nphase energy, solid-phase energy and momentum, based on semi-heuristic considera-\n\ntions and assuming uniform porosity, are presented below [44, 63, 67].\n\nFor the total mass conservation we have\n\n?\n???g?g\n\n?t\n+ ??\u00b7??g?g?u?g = 0. (2.21)\n\n\n\n24\n\nThe species mass conservation equation reads\n\n???g?g\n??Yi?g\n\n?t\n+ ???g?g?u?g \u00b7??Yi?g = ?\u00b7???g?g\n\n(\n?Dm?\n\ng\ni + ?D\n\nd\nm?\n\ng\ni\n\n)\n\u00b7??Yi?g\n\n???w?r,i?g, (2.22)\n\nwhere ??Dm?\ng\ni is the effective mass diffusivity tensor of species i and ??D\n\nd\nm?\n\ng\ni is the\n\nmass dispersion tensor of species i. Then, the effect of the porous medium on the\n\nconservation of species is included, first, in an effective diffusivity that may present\n\nanisotropic behavior and that depends on the solid matrix geometry and, second, via\n\nthe dispersion tensor that is an enhancement of the diffusivity of the species due to\n\nthe hydrodynamics of the local problem and is always anisotropic.\n\nThe gas-energy conservation equation is written as\n\n???g?gcp,g\n??Tg?g\n\n?t\n+ ???g?gcp,g?u?g \u00b7??Tg?g = ?\u00b7?\n\n(\n??g?g + ??g?gcp,g?Dd?g\n\n)\n\u00b7??Tg?g\n\n?\nN?\ni=1\n\n??g?g?Yi?gcp,i?vi,diff?g \u00b7??Tg?g +\nAgs\nV\nhgs (?Ts?s ??Tg?g)\n\n??\nN?\ni\n\nhi?w?r,i?g, (2.23)\n\nwhere ???g?g is the effective thermal conductivity tensor of the gas-phase, ?Dd?g is the\n\nthermal dispersion tensor and hgs is the surface convective heat transfer coefficient.\n\nAgain, the solid matrix introduces a geometric dependence in the effective thermal\n\nconductivity, leading to a tensorial description. The thermal dispersion enhances the\n\nthermal diffusivity of the media and is related to the matrix geometry and flow pattern\n\nof the local problem. Since non-equilibrium between the phases exists, the convection\n\nheat transfer effects are accounted for in a surface convection term based on hgs.\n\nRigorously, since there is energy generation in the gas phase, the average convective\n\ncoefficient becomes a function of the strength of the local energy generation [44].\n\n\n\n25\n\nThe solid phase conservation equation reads\n\n(1 ??)??s?scp,s\n??Ts?s\n\n?t\n= ?\u00b7 (1 ??)??s?s \u00b7??Ts?s\n\n?\nAgs\nV\nhgs (?Ts?s ??Tg?g) + ?\u00b7?q?r?, (2.24)\n\nwhere (1 ??)??s?s is the effective thermal conductivity tensor of the solid-phase and\n\n?q?r? is the volume-averaged radiant heat flux.\n\nFinally, the momentum conservation equation is written as\n\n??g?g\n\n?\n\n(\n??u?\n?t\n\n+ ?u? \u00b7??u?\n)\n\n= ??g?gf ???p?g\n\n+\n\u00b5\n\n?\n?2?u??\n\n\u00b5\n\nK\n?u??\n\nCE\nK1/2\n\n??g?g|?u?|?u?, (2.25)\n\nwhere K is the permeability tensor (a geometric property of the matrix) and CE is the\n\nErgun constant. The left hand side of Eq. (2.25) represents the macroscopic inertial\n\nforces. The first and second terms on the right hand side of Eq. (2.25) are respectively\n\nthe pore pressure gradient and the body force. The third term is the macroscopic\n\nshear stress diffusion term (Brinkman viscous term), the forth term is the microscopic\n\nviscous shear stress (Darcy term) and the fifth term is the microscopic inertial force\n\n(Ergun inertial term). When ? ? 1 (K ??) the macroscopic Navier-Sokes equation\n\nis recovered. Note, however, that the compressible effects were neglected in Eq. (2.25).\n\nThe ideal gas equation of state is\n\n?p?g =\nRu\nMg\n??g?g?Tg?g, (2.26)\n\nwhere the mixture molar mass is given by Mg =\n?Ns\n\n1 ?Xi?\ngMi.\n\nThis set of equations is simpler than that obtained from the rigorous application\n\nof the volume average method to the local problem. Here, the effects of the many\n\n\n\n26\n\ncoefficients that appear in the original equations are accounted for using fewer coeffi-\n\ncients, namely the effective thermal conductivity tensors of both phases, the mass and\n\nthermal dispersion tensors of the moving phase and the superficial convection heat\n\ntransfer coefficient. These coefficients have to be measured experimentally, which can\n\nbe a difficult task since they are coupled in the two-energy equation model [65].\n\n2.4 Reaction source term\n\nIn flames, the reaction region is characterized by the existence of several simultaneous\n\nelementary reactions [68]. For example consider the following elementary reaction\n\nO2 + H ? OH + O,\n\nwhere the molecular oxygen (O2) reacts with the atomic hydrogen radical (H) forming\n\ntwo new radicals, the hydroxyl (OH) and the atomic oxygen (O), in what is known\n\nas a branching step, i.e., one radical forming two radicals. The forward reaction rate\n\nr?f is proportional to the reagents concentrations\n\nr?f = kf [O2] [H] , (2.27)\n\nwhere the terms in brackets are molar concentrations ([H] = ?gYH/MH, for example)\n\nand kf is the forward reaction rate coefficient, which is usually written following an\n\nextended Arrhenius model\n\nkf = AT\na\ng exp\n\n(\n?Ea\nRuTg\n\n)\n, (2.28)\n\nwhere A is the pre-exponential factor, that is related to the collision frequency of the\n\nmolecules, a is the temperature exponent and Ea is the activation energy required for\n\nthe reaction to occur.\n\n\n\n27\n\nIn general, the reactions are reversible and the reverse reaction rate r?r is also\n\nincluded. Then, the net reaction rate for the elementary step under analysis is\n\nr? = r?f ? r?r = kf [O2] [H] ?kr [OH] [O] , (2.29)\n\nwhere the reverse reaction rate is found through the equilibrium constant Kc [68]\n\nKc(p,Tg) = kf/kr. (2.30)\n\nEach elementary reaction can be written in the general form\n\nNs?\ni=1\n\n?\n?\n\ni,jMi ?\nNs?\ni=1\n\n?\n??\n\ni,jMi, (2.31)\n\nwhere ?i,j is the number of moles of species i participating in the reaction j and Mi\n\nrepresents the species i. Then, the reaction rate of the jth reaction can be written as\n\nr?j = kf,j\n\nNs?\ni=1\n\n[Mi]\n?\n?\ni,j ?kr,j\n\nNs?\ni=1\n\n[Mi]\n?\n??\ni,j . (2.32)\n\nFinally, the reaction source term appearing in Eqs. (2.2) and (2.3) include the con-\n\ntributions of all Nr elementary reaction steps\n\nw?r,i = Mi\n\nNr?\nj=1\n\n(\n?\n??\n\ni,j ??\n?\n\ni,j\n\n)\nrj. (2.33)\n\nSeveral degrees of detail can be employed in constructing a chemical kinetic mech-\n\nanism. Reduced schemes based on global reaction steps are proposed to reproduce the\n\nmain behavior of flames with reduced computational cost. In this sense, a common\n\nsimplifying assumption is that the fuel combustion occurs following a global one-step\n\nirreversible mechanism, represented in mass units as\n\nF + ?O2 ? (1 + ?)P,\n\n\n\n28\n\nwhere ? is the stoichiometric mass of oxygen per mass of fuel ratio. Then, the fuel\n\nreaction rate can be written as\n\nw?r,F = ?A?2gT\na\ng Y\n\nn\nF Y\n\nm\nO exp\n\n(\n?Ea\nRuTg\n\n)\n, (2.34)\n\nwhere YF and YO are respectively the mass fraction of fuel and oxidant. This sim-\n\nple mechanism permits the adjustment of few parameters (a, A, n, m and Ea) to\n\nreproduce experimental results.\n\nDetailed [47, 69, 70] and reduced [48, 32, 43] mechanisms were employed to the\n\nproblem of premixed combustion in porous inert media. The results show that, for\n\nlean mixtures, the flame speed is less sensitive to the mechanism chosen, but the\n\nflame temperature is over-predicted when the one-step mechanism is used. A point\n\nthat is an open question is the influence of the porous matrix on the reaction rates.\n\nThe large specific superficial area of the matrix may act as a radical sink, reducing\n\nthe reaction rates. To the author knowledge, no model in the literature considers this\n\neffect.\n\nThe intrinsic volume-averaged homogeneous reaction rates are also heuristically\n\nmodeled in the works found in the literature. The average reaction rate is imposed\n\nto be equal to the reaction evaluated with the averaged variables. For example, the\n\none-step mechanism of Eq. (2.34) is simply re-written as\n\n?w?r,F?g = ?A (??g?g)\n2\n\n(?Tg?g)\na\n\n(?YF?g)\nn\n\n(?YO?g)\nm\nexp\n\n(\n?Ea\n\nRu?Tg?g\n\n)\n(2.35)\n\nIn the evaluation of Eq. (2.35), the use of the volume-averaged temperatures and\n\nconcentrations is a valid approximation only for small departures from equilibrium\n\n[4]. In this sense, the use of detailed kinetic models is still a crude approximation\n\nregarding the effect of temperature on the reaction rates. This is still an open issue,\n\n\n\n29\n\nnot completely solved.\n\n2.5 Radiant source term\n\nThe effect of the radiation field within the solid matrix has been included in the solid-\n\nphase energy equation, Eq. (2.24), as the radiant heat flux ?q?r?. Then, the radiation\n\nheat transfer that affected the boundary condition in the local problem, Eq. (2.8),\n\nbecomes an homogeneous treatment of a medium that emits, absorbs and scatters\n\nradiation, i.e., a participating medium.\n\nThe homogeneous treatment of the radiation in participating media requires the\n\nsolution of the radiant transfer equation (RTE). This equation represents the variation\n\nof the radiant intensity in a generic direction s [63]\n\ndI?\nds\n\n= ???,a?I?,b ? (???,a? + ???,s?) I?\n\n+\n???,s?\n\n2\n\n? 1\n?1\nI?(?i)????(?i ? ?)dcos?i, (2.36)\n\nwhere I? is the spectral (?) radiant intensity, i.e., the radiation energy in the direction\n\n? per unit time, per unit projected area, per unit solid angle and per interval d? around\n\nthe wavelength ? (W/m2sr\u00b5m), I?,b is the spectral blackbody emitted intensity (I?,b =\n\nE?,b/?, where E?,b is the spectral blackbody emissive power given by Plank\u2019s law for\n\nemission into vacuum), ???,a? and ???,s? are respectively the effective absorption and\n\nscattering coefficients (1/m), ? is the angle of propagation of the radiant beam (polar\n\nangle), ?i is the angle of the in-scattering direction and ???? is a phase function that\n\nmodels the directional scattering behavior of the medium. In the above equation,\n\nazimuthal symmetry is assumed. Then, the first term on the right hand side of Eq.\n\n(2.36) is a gain in the radiant intensity due to emission, the second term represents\n\n\n\n30\n\nlosses in the radiant intensity due to absorption and scattering and the last term\n\nis the gain in the radiant intensity due to the incident scattered radiation from all\n\ndirections (?i) into the direction ?.\n\nThe radiant heat flux is found integrating the radiant intensity over all directions\n\nand wavelengths,\n\n?q?r? = 2?\n? ?\n\n0\n\n? 1\n?1\nsI? dcos? d?. (2.37)\n\nFor optically thick media (where the extinction coefficient ???,e? = ???,a?+???,s? is\n\nlarge) a diffusion approximation can be proposed (Rosseland approximation [71, 72]).\n\nIn this limit, the radiant flux is assumed to be dependent on the local temperature\n\ngradient only and a radiant conductivity can be defined as\n\n?q?r? = ?(1 ??)\n\n[\n16?SB (?Ts?)\n\n3\n\n3???,e?\n\n]\n??Ts?s = ?(1 ??)??r???Ts?s, (2.38)\n\nwhere ?SB is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and ??r? is the effective radiant conduc-\n\ntivity of the solid-phase.\n\nThe Rosseland approximation is valid for small pores which often is not the case\n\nfor the porous media used in porous burners. Siegel and Howell [71] suggest that this\n\napproximation is valid for ? > 5, with ? being the optical thickness of the medium.\n\nThe optical thickness is equivalent to the ratio of the characteristic length of the\n\nsystem and the mean free-path lm for the radiation (lm = 1/???,e?). For the radiation\n\nheat transfer in a porous medium, the mean free-path can be estimated by lm =\n\n(ld/3)/(1 ? ?) [73], valid for pore diameters larger than 0.6 mm. The characteristic\n\nlength of the system can be assumed to be equal to the thermally affected region\n\naround the flame lT . Then, as an example, a ceramic foam with ? = 80% and lp = 2.0\n\nmm - and knowing that lT is of the order of 30 mm [1] - we will have a reasonably\n\n\n\n31\n\nlarge optical thickness (? = 6) and a radiant conductivity can be used as a first\n\napproximation to model the radiant heat transfer trough the solid matrix.\n\n2.6 Simplifying assumptions\n\nIn order to develop an analytic approximate solution for the problem of premixed\n\nflames within porous inert media some simplifying assumptions are required. Assum-\n\ning a global one-step reaction mechanism, a steady-state one-dimensional two-medium\n\nmodel for the conservation of mass, gas-phase energy, solid-phase energy and mass of\n\nchemical species is written following Sahraoui and Kaviany [44]. For simplicity, the\n\nvolume-averaging notation is omitted.\n\nThe mass conservation implies that ?nun is constant for the one-dimensional flow,\n\nwith ?n and un being respectively the gas density and the gas velocity far upstream\n\nfrom the flame. For a steady-state stationary flame, the laminar flame speed sF is\n\nequal to un. The gas-phase specific heat capacity cp, the effective thermal conduc-\n\ntivities (??g for the gas and (1 ??)?s for the solid) and the product ??D (gas-phase\n\ndensity times mass effective diffusivity) are assumed to be uniform along the flame.\n\nThe effective thermal conductivity of the solid-phase includes the pore tortuosity and\n\nthe intraphase radiation trough a radiant conductivity (Rosseland approximation).\n\nThe effective thermal conductivity and mass diffusivity of the gas-phase include the\n\npore tortuosity and the hydrodynamic dispersion effects. The diffusion of heat due to\n\nthe species diffusion is neglected in the gas-phase energy equation. The pressure drop\n\nacross the porous medium is assumed negligible when compared to the total pressure\n\nand the momentum equation becomes trivial.\n\n\n\n32\n\nThe steady-state volume-averaged mass, species and energy conservation equa-\n\ntions then become\n\n??u = ??nsF , (2.39)\n\n??nsF\ndYF\ndx\n\n= ??DF\nd2YF\ndx2\n\n??A?2YOYF Tag e\n?Ea/RuTg, (2.40)\n\n??nsF\ndYO\ndx\n\n= ??DO\nd2YO\ndx2\n\n???A?2YOYF Tag e\n?Ea/RuTg, (2.41)\n\n??nsFcp\ndTg\ndx\n\n= ??g\nd2Tg\ndx2\n\n+ ?QA?2YOYFT\na\ng e\n?Ea/RuTg + hv(Ts ?Tg), (2.42)\n\n0 = (1 ??)?s\nd2Ts\ndx2\n?hv(Ts ?Tg), (2.43)\n\nwhere ?DF and ?DO are de fuel and oxidant effective mass diffusivities, Q is the fuel\n\nmass based heat of reaction and hv is the volumetric surface-convection coefficient\n\n(hv = hgsAgs/V ).\n\nThis set of conservation equations will be applied in the subsequent chapters.\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nAsymptotic solution for\nmoderately lean mixtures\n\nIn this chapter, the method of matched asymptotic expansions is used to solve the\n\nproblem of a stationary premixed flame in an infinite adiabatic porous medium. The\n\nsolution is obtained for the case of moderately lean mixtures, where the interphase\n\nheat transfer is not intense.\n\n3.1 Introduction\n\nThe problem of a stationary flame within an inert porous medium has been stud-\n\nied analytically before. From the earlier analysis, Deshaies and Joulin [74](semi-\n\ninfinite burner) and Buckmaster and Takeno [75] (finite length burner) used the\n\nhigh-activation-energy asymptotic method to solve the flame structure considering\n\nthat the solid-phase temperature is constant and equal to the adiabatic flame tem-\n\nperature. These models divide the flame in a pre-heating region, a thin combustion\n\nregion and a post-combustion region. The results agreed with the numerical solutions\n\nobtained by Takeno and Sato [9] and Takeno et al. [76]. However, these solutions\n\n33\n\n\n\n34\n\nare restricted to very large solid-phase thermal conductivities. Following these earlier\n\nworks, Boshoff-Mostert and Viljoen [77] presented an analytical solution for the com-\n\nbustion in a monolith of finite length. The difference from previous work is that their\n\nmodel accounts for the variations of the solid-phase temperature. The flame position\n\nwithin the porous medium is defined as a function of an imposed flame velocity.\n\nThe problem of gas combustion in porous inert media exhibits some similarities\n\nwith the field of filtration combustion. A series of analytical works has been presented\n\nby Aldushin, Matkowsky and coworkers [78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83] covering many aspects\n\nof smoldering and self-propagating high temperature synthesis (SHS). In these prob-\n\nlems, an oxidant stream filtrates through the porous medium until it reaches the\n\nreaction front, where heterogeneous reactions take place. As a result, the combustion\n\ndevelops as a traveling wave. In the case of forward filtration combustion, supera-\n\ndiabatic temperatures are observed. In this situation, Aldushin et al. [81] analyze\n\nthe conditions that lead to the maximum energy accumulation at the flame. Wahle\n\nand Matkowsky [82] and Wahle et al. [83] show that one-equation models for the\n\nconservation of energy are only appropriate for the case of slow combustion waves, in\n\nwhich there is enough contact time between the phases and local thermal equilibrium\n\nis reached. Two-equation models for the energy transport must be used when the\n\ngas velocity is increased beyond the point that the large contact time assumption is\n\nviolated and local thermal non-equilibrium arises.\n\nZhdanok et al. [36] investigated analytically and experimentally the filtration\n\ncombustion of methane-air mixtures within an inert porous medium. The study\n\nshows that the superposition of a thermal and a reaction wave can be reached by\n\ncontrolling the filtration rate of the reactants mixture. In this case, high excess\n\n\n\n35\n\nenthalpy is reached at the flame. The superadiabatic effect is amplified when the\n\nthermal and reaction waves have close velocities of propagation. Bubnovich et al.\n\n[84] proposed an analytical solution for the filtration combustion of lean methane-\n\nair mixtures in a semi-infinite inert porous medium with heat loss, considering the\n\nlocal thermal equilibrium approximation. The burner was divided in a pre-heating\n\nregion, a reaction region and a region filled with combustion products. The closure for\n\nthe system of equations is obtained by providing an equation for the flame ignition\n\ntemperature. This equation is developed following the classical free-flame theory,\n\nconsidering that the thickness of the reaction region is of the same order of the pore\n\nsize. Algebraic expressions for the temperature and concentration profiles and for the\n\nvelocity of the combustion wave were determined.\n\nMcIntosh [85] and McIntosh and Prothero [86] proposed a model for the surface\n\ncombustion with radiant heat loss, i.e., for a porous burner in which the flame is\n\nstabilized on the porous medium surface or just above it. In these burners the flame is\n\ncooled by the radiant heat loss, which implies in low NOx emissions. This work relies\n\non the large-activation-energy asymptotic method to derive an analytical solution\n\nfor the gas and solid temperatures. The solutions depend on (i) a convective heat\n\ntransfer parameter, (ii) a radiant loss coefficient and (iii) the ratio of the gas-phase to\n\nthe solid-phase thermal conductivities, which is imposed to be of the order of unity.\n\nAs in the previous works the combustion front is divided in three regions and the\n\nflame position is a function of a specified flame velocity. The result showed the effect\n\nof those three parameters on flame location and allowed for the prediction of the\n\nblow-off and flashback conditions.\n\nHere, an asymptotic solution for a stationary flame within an infinite adiabatic\n\n\n\n36\n\nporous burner is proposed. This condition is similar to that of a long insulated burner\n\nin which the flame stabilizes deeply within the porous medium. In contrast to the\n\nother asymptotic solutions mentioned above, the present model takes advantage from\n\nthe large difference between the thermal conductivity of the solid and gas phases.\n\nThis difference allows for the separation of the problem in characteristic length-scales\n\ncorresponding to the heat conduction in the solid-phase (outer region) and to the\n\nheat and mass diffusion in the gas-phase (first inner region). Another characteristic\n\nlength-scale is associated to the reaction zone (second inner region) and its solution\n\ngives a closed form equation for the flame velocity.\n\nThis treatment relies on a closer examination of the different characteristic length-\n\nscales and of the source of the large local thermal non-equilibrium present in flames\n\nwithin porous media. The scales are assumed to be sufficiently separated such that\n\nthe asymptotic expansion method can be used to determine the flame structure.\n\nClosed form solutions for the gas- and solid-phase temperatures, fuel and oxidant\n\nmass fractions, flame speed, flame thickness and heat recirculation efficiency are found\n\nas a function of the problem parameters. The effects of the thermal conductivities\n\nratio, equivalence ratio, volumetric porosity and fuel Lewis number on such flames\n\nare evidenced.\n\nAlthough many articles have been published on this subject, to the best of the\n\nauthor\u2019s knowledge, none has presented a universal relation connecting the gas- and\n\nsolid-phase properties with the flame structure and superadiabatic effect. Such rela-\n\ntion could be used to improve the understanding regarding the origin of the limiting\n\nconditions for flame propagation, the upper limit for the superadiabatic effect and\n\n\n\n37\n\nthe combined effects of gas-phase Lewis number, porosity and interfacial heat trans-\n\nfer coefficient on the extent of departure from thermal equilibrium. The main goal\n\nhere is to evidence the effect of the problem parameters on the flame structure and\n\nheat recirculation in a simple explicit form. For this purpose, the large activation\n\nenergy asymptotic theory is employed. This analysis can suggest new ways to tailor\n\nthe porous medium and gas-phase to reach the maximum combustion efficiency.\n\nThe model developed in this chapter is valid for near-stoichiometric mixtures, a\n\ncondition where high flame velocities are found. In these cases, the interphase heat\n\ntransfer in the inner scales of the problem is negligible due to the small contact\n\ntime between the phases. This will be characterized by small values of an interphase\n\nheat transfer parameter N, to be defined in Section 3.3.1. In the next two chapters\n\nextensions to the present model to lower equivalence ratios will be presented.\n\nIn the following, the physics of the combustion in porous inert media is reviewed\n\nwith the aim of identifying the characteristic length-scales and their basic properties.\n\nThen, the equations for the model are written and solved using the well established\n\nasymptotic expansion method [87]. Finally, the obtained results are presented and\n\ndiscussed. A comparison between the analytical model and a numerical solution of\n\nthe differential equations, providing an assessment of the effect of the simplifying\n\nassumptions on the details of the solution obtained, is also presented.\n\n\n\n38\n\n3.2 Length-scales and thermal non-equilibrium\n\nThe main difference between flames in porous media and freely propagating flames is\n\nthe presence of the solid-phase thermally connecting the two sides of the flame. This\n\nconnection enhances the thermal diffusion from the hot burned gases to the fresh\n\nunburned gases. Also, the radiant heat transfer among solid surfaces increases the\n\nheat transfer from the hot region to the cold region, specially for porous structures\n\nwith small optical thicknesses [47]. As a consequence of this heat transfer enhance-\n\nment (heat recirculation), the flame reaches temperatures higher than those in freely\n\npropagating flames, i.e. superadiabatic flame temperatures.\n\nThe properties of the gas and solid phases are very dissimilar. The solid-phase\n\nthermal conductivity can be several orders of magnitude larger than that of the\n\ngas-phase. As a result, in a large region around the flame, significant differences\n\nbetween the temperatures of the two phases are found (local thermal non-equilibrium)\n\nleading to interphase heat transfer [4]. This surface convection heat transfer between\n\nthe phases depends on the interfacial surface area and on the flow field within the\n\nporous structure. The region where the heat conduction in the solid-phase prevails\n\nover the gas-phase conduction is associated to a characteristic length-scale, which\n\nis not present in freely propagating flames. The model developed here relies on a\n\nphysical description based on separation of characteristic length-scales. This physical\n\ndescription is reviewed next.\n\nFigure 3.1 presents a rendering of a stationary adiabatic plane flame within an\n\ninfinite inert porous medium. The flame structure can be described in four levels\n\nof detail. In a first level, Fig. 3.1a, the flame front propagates with velocity sF\n\nagainst the unburnt gas. For stationary flames sF = un, where un is the incoming\n\n\n\n39\n\nFigure 3.1: Rendering of the temperatures and fuel mass fraction distributions for\nthe different characteristic length-scales of the problem.\n\n\n\n40\n\n(phasic averaged) gas velocity. Note that the Darcean flame speed, sD, equal to the\n\nfiltration velocity for stationary flames, is related to the phasic averaged flame speed\n\nby sD = ? sF , where ? is the volumetric porosity of the matrix. In this first level of\n\ndetail, the flame front separates two regions where gas and solid are in thermodynamic\n\nequilibrium. Upstream from the front, the temperatures of both phases and the fuel\n\nmass fraction are equal to their initial values, Tn and YFn respectively. Downstream\n\nfrom the front, the temperatures of both phases reach the adiabatic flame temperature\n\nTr, according to the thermodynamic requirement, and the fuel mass fraction jumps\n\ndown to its final value, YFr, which is zero for lean mixtures.\n\nIn the second level of detail, Fig. 3.1b, the heat transfer by conduction through\n\nthe solid-phase, the interphase surface heat transfer and the gas-phase convection\n\n(advection) heat transfer control the problem. Frozen flow is assumed upstream and\n\nchemical equilibrium flow is assumed downstream from the flame front. However,\n\nthermal non-equilibrium between the phases occurs upstream and downstream from\n\nthe flame sheet, establishing the interphase surface heat transfer. The transport of\n\nmass and heat by diffusion in the gas-phase can be neglected in this level. As a\n\nresult of this assumption, both the gas-phase temperature and the fuel mass fraction\n\ndistributions are discontinuous across the flame sheet. Upstream from the flame the\n\nunburnt gas is heated up by the solid-phase (first pre-heating region) and downstream\n\nfrom the flame the solid-phase is heated up by the burned gas (re-equilibrium region).\n\nAt the flame sheet the gas temperature reaches the superadiabatic peak, Tsup, and\n\nthen decreases in the re-equilibrium region to the adiabatic flame temperature Tr. The\n\nfuel mass fraction is constant and equal to its initial value upstream from the flame\n\nand is completely consumed at the flame sheet for lean mixtures. The temperature of\n\n\n\n41\n\nthe solid-phase varies smoothly from its initial temperature Tn to its final temperature\n\nTr as a result of heat transfer by conduction and radiation. Then, the extent of this\n\nthermally affected region is determined by a balance among the conduction trough the\n\nsolid-phase, the interphase heat transfer and the advection transport in the gas-phase.\n\nIn the present model, this large region of thermal non-equilibrium is related to a\n\ncharacteristic solid-phase diffusion length-scale, defined as the ratio of the solid-phase\n\nconduction to the gas-phase convection, lS ? (1??)?s/(??nsFcp), where (1??)?s is the\n\nsolid-phase effective thermal conductivity, ?n is the unburnt gas-phase density and cp\n\nis the gas-phase heat capacity. From the volume-averaging theory, this effective solid\n\nthermal conductivity must include a tortuosity effect as well as a radiant contribution\n\n[63].\n\nIn the third level of detail, Fig. 3.1c, the flame sheet is expanded, thus revealing\n\nthe mass and heat transfer by diffusion in the gas-phase (second pre-heating region).\n\nThe reaction is a source of thermal energy and a sink for reactants in the gas-phase\n\n(a reaction sheet). Thus, near the reaction sheet, the gas temperature increases due\n\nto the gas-phase heat conduction and the fuel concentration decreases because of the\n\nfuel depletion towards the reaction sheet. In this level of detail, the gas tempera-\n\nture and fuel mass fraction distributions are continuous across the reaction sheet,but\n\ntheir first derivatives are still discontinuous. The solid-phase temperature profile is\n\napproximately linear because the interphase heat transfer is expected to be negligible\n\nwhen compared to the gas conduction heat transfer in the second pre-heating region.\n\nA characteristic gas-phase diffusion length-scale can be defined as the ratio of the\n\ngas-phase conduction to the gas-phase convection, lG ? ??g/(??nsF cp), where ??g is\n\nthe gas-phase effective thermal conductivity. The relation between the solid- and the\n\n\n\n42\n\ngas-phase characteristic diffusion length-scales is expressed by\n\nlG\nlS\n\n=\n?\n\n(1 ??)?\n,\n\nwhere ? is the ratio of the solid and gas thermal conductivities (? ? ?s/?g). Note\n\nthat for freely propagating flames the gas diffusion length-scale is defined as l0G ?\n\n?0g/(?ns\n0\nFcp), where s\n\n0\nF is the flame velocity for free flames and ?\n\n0\ng is the gas-phase\n\nmolecular thermal conductivity. The ratio of the gas-phase diffusion length-scale for\n\nflames within porous media and that for free flames is lG/l\n0\nG = (?g/?\n\n0\ng)(s\n\n0\nF/sF ). Since\n\nsF is expected to be more than two times larger than s\n0\nF [47], as a consequence of\n\nthe heat recirculation, the gas-phase diffusion length-scale for flames within porous\n\nmedia is thinner than that for free flames, lG &lt;l\n0\nG.\n\nAs the porosity of the matrix increases the solid-phase characteristic length-scale\n\nbecomes shorter. For the case of ?/(1??) ? ? the two length-scales are of the same\n\norder of magnitude (lG/lS ? 1). Then, ?/(1 ? ?) ? ? is the necessary condition\n\nto ensure the scale separation. For the case ?/(1 ? ?) ? O(1) the ratio between the\n\ncharacteristic length-scales reduces to lG/lS ? O(1/?). In the present model, this\n\nlimit is considered.\n\nThe limit ? ? 1, not analyzed in this work, imposes a negligible effect of the\n\nsolid-phase heat conduction process on the flame, compared to the other processes,\n\nleading to thermal equilibrium in a wider region around the flame. In this case, in\n\norder to evaluate the contribution of the conduction in the solid-phase on premixed\n\nflames in porous media, it would be necessary to analyze the limit 1 ?? = O(??1).\n\nIn the last, and more complete, level of detail, Fig. 3.1d, the reaction sheet is\n\nexpanded revealing the chemical reaction and the continuous variation of the gas\n\ntemperature and fuel mass fraction first derivatives. Now, it is of interest to define a\n\n\n\n43\n\ncharacteristic reaction length-scale lR. This can be achieved through the continuity\n\nof the heat flux at the flame, ?TR /lR ? ?TG /lG , where ?TR is the gas-phase\n\ntemperature change across the reaction region and ?TG is the gas-phase temperature\n\nchange across the second pre-heating region (?TG = Tr ? Tn, since all the heat of\n\ncombustion is released within the reaction region). The temperature variation across\n\nthe reaction region can be approximated by ?TR ? (w/ (dw/dT))Tsup , where w is\n\nthe reaction rate. Then, based on the simplest kinetic mechanism of one global step,\n\nmodeled by an Arrhenius reaction rate model, the relations among the characteristic\n\nlength-scales are\n\nlR\nlG\n\n=\nRuTsup\nEa\n\nTsup\n(Tr ?Tn)\n\n?\n1\n\n??\n? ? and\n\nlR\nlS\n\n=\n?\n\n(1 ??)\n1\n\n?? ?\n=\n\n?\n\n(1 ??)\n?\n\n?\n,\n\nwhere ?? is a modified Zel\u2019dovich number, Ru is the universal gas constant and Ea is\n\nthe activation energy. For freely propagating flames, the ratio between the reaction\n\nand the gas-diffusion length-scales is l0R/l\n0\nG = 1/? ? ?\n\n0, where ? is the classical\n\nZel\u2019dovich number (? ? Ea (Tr ?Tn) /(RuT 2r )) which usually lies between 5 and 15\n\n[87, 88, 89]. Since Tsup > Tr and defining Tsup ? Tr +TH, with TH/Tr &lt;1, the ratio of\n\nthe reaction length-scale for flames within porous media to that of freely propagating\n\nflames can be estimated as\n\nlR\nl0R\n?\ns0F\nsF\n\n?g\n?0g\n\n[\n1 + 2\n\n(\nTH\nTr\n\n)]\n.\n\nThe expression above shows that the reaction length-scale lR is expected to be\n\nsmaller for flames within porous media than for freely propagating flames. Neverthe-\n\nless, the ratio between the reaction and the gas-diffusion length-scales is larger for\n\nflames in porous media, ?/?0 ? 1 + 2(TH/Tr).\n\nFor freely propagating flames at 1 atm and reactants at 298 K, the flame thickness\n\n\n\n44\n\nis of the order of 1 mm for hydrocarbon fuels [68]. In porous media, the flame\n\nthickness, defined as the sum of the second pre-heating region and the reaction region\n\nthicknesses, is expected to be of the same order of magnitude. The typical ceramic\n\nfoams used as solid matrix in porous burners have pore diameters ranging from 1 to\n\n4 mm. The exceptions are the surface burners where smaller pore diameters are used\n\n[32]. Then, the reactions are not expected to spread over several pores but to be\n\nconfined to a fraction of a single pore. As discussed before, results of direct numerical\n\nsimulations obtained by Sahraoui and Kaviany [44] and Hackert et al. [51] confirm\n\nthis hypothesis. Therefore, the description of the structure of premixed gas flames\n\nwithin inert porous media is very similar to that of free flames and we take advantage\n\nof this idealization. The main difference is that in the combustion in porous media\n\nthere is an additional wider region (lS) of heat exchange between the gas and solid\n\nphases leading to higher gas temperatures.\n\nAs a consequence, from the asymptotic point of view, the flame structure analysis\n\nfollows the hypothesis that lR ? lG ? lS. From the point of view of the use of a\n\ncontinuous treatment for the porous medium [63], it is assumed that lS > lrev ?\n\nld, where lrev is the characteristic length of the representative elementary volume\n\nover which the volume averaging is done and ld is the characteristic length of the\n\npores. This means that the solid- and gas-phase temperature variations spread over\n\na large number of pores, that is a reasonable assumption for the porous structures of\n\ninterest. Since the diffusion of heat and mass in the gas-phase are significant only in\n\na length-scale (lG) of the order of the pore diameter, the solutions of the second pre-\n\nheating region and the reaction region will behave similarly to a sub-grid model for the\n\nprediction of the flame speed. This will be evidenced when the heat transfer between\n\n\n\n45\n\nthe phases is neglected in both problems of the order of lG and lR, showing that the\n\nsolid-phase temperature solution for these scales do not bring new information to the\n\nproblem.\n\n3.3 Mathematical formulation\n\nA one-dimensional two-medium model for the conservation of mass, gas-phase en-\n\nergy, solid-phase energy and mass of chemical species, as given by Eqs. (2.39) to\n\n(2.43), is considered. In the sequence these equations are non-dimensionalized and\n\nsolved by asymptotic expansions taking advantage of the differences among the three\n\ncharacteristic length-scales identified.\n\n3.3.1 Non-dimensionalization\n\nDefining the non-dimensional variables [88]\n\nyF ?\nYF\nYFn\n\n, yO ?\nYO\nYOn\n\n, ? ?\ncp(T ?Tn)\nYFn Q\n\n=\nT ?Tn\nTr ?Tn\n\nand ? ?\n? x\n\n0\n\n?nsFcp\n?s\n\ndx,\n\nEqs.

(3.3) and (3.4) is related to the heat transfer\n\nbetween the phases and is defined as\n\nN ?\n?shv\n\n(?n sF cp)2\n. (3.5)\n\nIn the present model, the interphase heat transfer parameter N is assumed to be of\n\nthe order of unity. In the next chapters, other limits to the parameter N will be\n\nexplored.\n\nIn the present work, the length-scale lS is chosen such that the heat conduction\n\nthrough the solid effective medium balances the heat convected by the gas-phase\n\nand, therefore, is of the same order of magnitude as the interphase heat transfer [a\n\ncondition represented by N ? O(1) ]. It is worth to note that for intense interphase\n\nheat transfer, N ? 1, or for low interphase heat transfer, N ? 1, a new characteristic\n\nlength-scale can be defined as l\n? ? O(lSN?1/2) to capture the thermal non-equilibrium\n\nregion in a length-scale of the order of unity. Note also that the present solution is\n\nconstructed under the hypothesis that ?/(1??) ? O(1). Then the parameter ? is not\n\nused to define the nondimensional coordinate ?.\n\n\n\n47\n\nIn a region of the order of unity around the flame, the parameter ? appears\n\ndividing the diffusion terms in Eqs. (3.1) to (3.3) and it satisfies the condition ? ? 1.\n\nBy using this property, it is possible to employ the singular perturbation method to\n\nfind an analytical solution for the problem [90, 91, 92]. In a region of the order of\n\n??1 near the flame, the gas-phase temperature reaches its maximum value (the flame\n\ntemperature). Then, since the non-dimensional gas-phase temperature variation is\n\nof the order of unity, but the spatial variation is of the order of ??1, the description\n\nof the second pre-heating region follows a boundary layer expansion. In a region of\n\nthe order of ???1 the variables present a small variation of the order of ? and the\n\nlarge-activation-energy asymptotic expansion is employed.\n\nIn the following, the order unity problem, corresponding to the solid-phase diffu-\n\nsion length-scale lS, is solved. Then, the problem of the order of ?\n?1, corresponding\n\nto the gas-phase diffusion length-scale lG, is solved. Finally, the problem of the order\n\nof ???1, corresponding to the reaction length-scale lR, is solved.\n\n3.3.2 Outer zone: problem of the order of unity\n\nIn the characteristic length-scale ? ? ?f = O(1), the diffusive terms in the gas-phase\n\nare of the order of ??1 and the reaction is exponentially small.

(3.20)\n\nEven out of its range of validity the model can show important tendencies for the\n\nflame behavior at the limits for the volumetric porosity. Then, from Eq. (3.20), we\n\nobserve that for very low values of porosity, ? ? 1, the solid-phase temperature at\n\n\n\n50\n\nthe flame approaches a limiting value equal to unity according to ?\n(0)\ns (?f ) ? 1??2/N.\n\nConversely, for high porosity, 1 ? ? ? 1, the solid-phase temperature at the flame\n\napproaches a limiting value equal to 1/2 according to ?\n(0)\ns (?f ) ? 1/2 + [N(1??)]1/2/4.\n\nThereby, it is possible to conclude that 1/2 &lt;?\n(0)\ns (?f ) &lt;1 for every possible value of\n\nporosity.\n\nOnce knowing the leading order term of the solid-phase temperature ?\n(0)\ns , the\n\nleading order term of the gas-phase temperature ?\n(0)\ng can be determined from Eq.\n\n(3.17), obtaining\n\n?(0)g =\n\n{\n[(1 ??)/?] r1 ?\n\n(0)\ns (?f )e\n\nr1(???f ), for ? ? ?f,\n1 + [(1 ??)/?] r2 [1 ??\n\n(0)\ns (?f )]e\n\n?r2(???f ), for ? ? ?f.\n(3.21)\n\nImposing the condition ? = ?f in the solution for the gas-phase temperature, Eq.\n\n(3.21), the following values for the upstream and downstream sides of the flame are\n\nfound respectively by\n\n?(0)g (?\n?\nf ) = [(1 ??)/?] r1?\n\n(0)\ns (?f ), (3.22)\n\n?(0)g (?\n+\nf ) = 1 + [(1 ??)/?] r2 [1 ??\n\n(0)\ns (?f )]. (3.23)\n\nSubtracting Eq. (3.22) from Eq. (3.23) and applying the definition of ?\n(0)\ns (?f ),\n\nEq. (3.20), the difference ?\n(0)\ng (?\n\n+\nf )??\n\n(0)\ng (?\n\n?\nf ) reveals the discontinuity of the gas-phase\n\ntemperature across the flame in the scale of the order of unity, which is\n\n?(0)g (?\n+\nf ) ??\n\n(0)\ng (?\n\n?\nf ) = 1. (3.24)\n\nThis result was expected since all the heat released by the combustion process\n\nis confined to a thin region (the flame sheet in Fig. 3.1b). This means that all the\n\nheat recirculated to the gas-phase in the first pre-heating region must result in excess\n\n\n\n51\n\ntemperature at the downstream side of the flame, i.e., the difference between the\n\nmaximum temperature at the flame and the adiabatic flame temperature based on\n\nthe incoming reactants.\n\nAgain, it is worth analyzing the model at the limits for the volumetric porosity.\n\nFor very low porosities, ? ? 1, the gas and solid phases are in thermal equilibrium\n\nexcept in a region of the order of ??1 around the flame. In this case, at the upstream\n\nside of the flame, the temperature of both phases can be approximated by ?\n(0)\ng (?\n\n?\nf ) =\n\n?\n(0)\ns (?f ) ? 1 ? ?2/N and the value of the gas-phase temperature at the downstream\n\nside of the flame can be determined from Eq. (3.24), ?\n(0)\ng (?\n\n+\nf ) ? 2 ? ?/N\n\n2. For\n\nthe other extreme condition, very high porosities, 1 ? ? ? 1, the solution tends\n\nto a free flame solution. The temperature of the two phases in the region ? ? ?f\n\nare equal to zero, except very close to the flame. At this location, the gas-phase\n\ntemperature is ?\n(0)\ng (?\n\n?\nf ) ? N\n\n1/2(1??)1/2?(0)s (?f ). Then, the gas-phase temperature at\n\nthe downstream side of the flame differs very little from the adiabatic value, ?\n(0)\ng (?\n\n+\nf ) ?\n\n1 + N1/2(1 ? ?)1/2?(0)s (?f ). Thereby, it is possible to conclude that 1 &lt;?\n(0)\ng (?\n\n+\nf ) &lt;2\n\nfor every possible value of porosity.\n\nThe heat recirculated by the porous medium is equal to the gas pre-heating in\n\nthe problem of the order of unity. Then, a heat recirculation efficiency can be de-\n\nfined as the ratio between the heat recirculated and the total energy released by the\n\ncombustion process as\n\n?rec ?\n?nsFcp(T\n\n?\ng,f ?Tn)\n\n?nsFYF,nQ\n= ?(0)g (?\n\n?\nf ), (3.25)\n\nwhere T?g,f is the flame temperature at the upstream side of the flame. Recalling the\n\ndefinition of the non-dimensional temperature, it is seen that the expression for the\n\nheat recirculation efficiency is exactly the non-dimensional gas-phase temperature at\n\n\n\n52\n\nthe upstream side of the flame, Eq. (3.22).\n\nSubstituting Eqs. (3.20) and (3.22) into (3.25) one finds\n\n?rec = (1 + N?)\n?1/2, (3.26)\n\nwhere\n\nN? =\n4?2\n\nN(1 ??)\n. (3.27)\n\nThen, Eqs. (3.22), (3.23) and (3.20) can be expressed in the following form:\n\n?(0)g (?\n?\nf ) = ?rec, (3.28)\n\n?(0)g (?\n+\nf ) = 1 + ?rec, (3.29)\n\n?(0)s (?f ) = (1 + ?rec)/2. (3.30)\n\nUnder the hypothesis considered here, the number N? is the parameter that char-\n\nacterizes the flame variables, universalizing the results. This means that different\n\nmatrix properties and equivalence ratios will lead to the same values of ?\n(0)\ns (?f ),\n\n?\n(0)\ng (?\n\n?\nf ) and ?\n\n(0)\ng (?\n\n+\nf ), provided the parameter N? is kept constant. For this reason we\n\nchoose to call this number the porous-media-flame number.\n\nAs a way of interpreting the parameter N?, an analogy can be made. By using\n\nthe N and lS definitions, N? can be written as\n\nN? = 4\n\n(\nhvlS\n\n??nsFcp\n\n)?1\n. (3.31)\n\nNow, applying the definition of the number of transfer units (NTU) for a porous\n\nmedium we have\n\nNTU =\n\n(\nh\n\n?ucp\n\n)\nAgs\nAu\n\n=\n\n(\nh\n\n?ucp\n\n)\nSgsV\n\n?AT\n=\n\nhvL\n\n??ucp\n, (3.32)\n\n\n\n53\n\nwhere Ags is the interphase surface area , Au is the transversal area of the fluid phase,\n\nSgs is the interphase surface area density (m\n2/m3) and V , AT and L are respectively\n\nthe total volume, total transversal area and total length of the porous medium. Then,\n\nthe parameter N? is a particular case of the reciprocal of the number of transfer units\n\nbased on the length-scale lS and on the flame velocity sF ,\n\nN? = 4/NTUS and NTUS =\nhvlS\n\n??nsFcp\n. (3.33)\n\nBy making use of the universal description of the flame properties with N?, it\n\nis seen explicitly that the solid-phase temperature at the flame in the considered\n\nconditions is equal to the half of the gas-phase temperature, ?\n(0)\ns (?f ) = ?\n\n(0)\ng (?\n\n+\nf )/2.\n\nIn the next section, the second pre-heating region is analyzed.\n\n3.3.3 Inner zone: problem of the order of ??1\n\nIn this zone, the variation of the non-dimensional gas-phase temperature and fuel\n\nand oxidant mass fractions are of the order of unity along a characteristic length of\n\nthe order of ??1 around the flame. Since there is no chemical source in the energy\n\nconservation equation for the solid-phase, the variations of the solid-phase tempera-\n\nture are of the order of ??1. The solution in this thin zone is denoted by y\n(?)\nF , y\n\n(?)\nO ,\n\n?\n(?)\ng and ?\n\n(?)\ns . The thin region around the flame, defined by the length-scale ?\n\n?1, is\n\nanalyzed imposing the conditions that near the flame, more precisely at ?(???f ) = ?,\n\nthe reactants mass fractions vary according to 1 ? y(?)F ? 0, 1 ? y\n(?)\nO ? (1 ??) and\n\n?\n(0)\ng (?\n\n?\nf ) ? ?\n\n(?)\ng ? ?(0)g (?+f ).\n\n\n\n54\n\nBy re-scaling the spatial coordinate, and remembering that the reaction is expo-\n\nnentially small, the governing equations become\n\n?\ndy\n\n(?)\nF\n\nd?\n=\n\n?\n\nLeF\n\nd2y\n(?)\nF\n\nd?2\n, (3.34)\n\n?\ndy\n\n(?)\nO\n\nd?\n=\n\n?\n\nLeO\n\nd2y\n(?)\nO\n\nd?2\n, (3.35)\n\n?\nd?\n\n(?)\ng\n\nd?\n= ?\n\nd2?\n(?)\ng\n\nd?2\n+\nN\n\n?\n(?(?)s ??\n\n(?)\ng ), (3.36)\n\n0 = (1 ??)\nd2?\n\n(?)\ns\n\nd?2\n?\nN\n\n?2\n(?(?)s ??\n\n(?)\ng ). (3.37)\n\nThis problem corresponds to the second pre-heating region as described in Fig.\n\n3.1c. The boundary conditions are determined when the solution corresponding to the\n\nproblem of the order of ??1 is matched with the problem of the order of unity. Thus,\n\nfor ? ??? (upstream from the flame), ?(?)g ? ?(0)g , ?(?)s ? ?(0)s , y(?)F ? y\n(0)\nF = 1 and\n\ny\n(?)\nO ? y\n\n(0)\nO = 1. At the flame, ?\n\n(?)\ng is given by Eq. (3.23), ?\n\n(?)\ns by Eq. (3.20), y\n\n(?)\nF = 0\n\nand y\n(?)\nO = 1??. Since the gas-phase temperature gradient at the downstream side of\n\nthe flame is small when compared to the gradient at the upstream side, the solutions\n\nfor ? ? ? coincide with the solutions for the problem of the order of unity and do\n\nnot bring new information.\n\nThe solution of Eqs. (3.34) and (3.35) for ? ? ?f are\n\ny\n(?)\nF = 1 ?e\n\nLeF (???f ), (3.38)\n\ny\n(?)\nO = 1 ??e\n\nLeO (???f ). (3.39)\n\nAn analysis of Eqs.

(3.40)\n\nThe temperature profiles are determined by the substitution of Eq. (3.40) into\n\nEqs. (3.36) and (3.37) in the limit ? ??.

(3.42)\n\nAnalyzing Eqs. (3.40) and (3.42) we find that ?\n(?)(0)\ns = C\n\n(?)\n1 and ?\n\n(?)(1)\ns = C\n\n(?)\n2 ?, in\n\nwhich the value of C\n(?)\n1 and C\n\n(?)\n2 are determined matching the solution ?\n\n(?)\ns with ?\n\n(0)\ns .\n\nThe matching implies that, for ? ? ??, the function must be continuous and the\n\nheat flux in the solid-phase d?\n(?)\ns /d? is equal to the heat flux ?\n\n?1d?\n(0)\ns /d? at ? = ?f .\n\nThen, C\n(?)\n1 = ?\n\n(0)\ns (?f ) and C\n\n(?)\n2 = d?\n\n(0)\ns /d?|?=?f .\n\nThe solution of equation Eq. (3.41) is ?\n(?)(0)\ng (?) = C\n\n(?)\n3 e\n\n? + C\n(?)\n4 . The constants\n\nare determined by the matching with the profile of ?\n(0)\ng at ? = ?f . Thus, as ? ???,\n\n?\n(?)(0)\ng ? ?(0)g (??f ) leading to ?\n\n(?)(0)\ng (?) = C\n\n(?)\n3 e\n\n? + ?\n(0)\ng (?\n\n?\nf ) . The value of C\n\n(?)\n3 is\n\nspecified applying the condition at the flame, ?\n(?)(0)\ng (? = 0) = ?\n\n(0)\ng (?\n\n+\nf ), then, recalling\n\nthat ?\n(0)\ng (?\n\n+\nf ) ??\n\n(0)\ng (?\n\n?\nf ) = 1, we have\n\n?(?)(0)g (?) = ?\n(0)\ng (?\n\n?\nf ) + e\n\n(???f ). (3.43)\n\nThe flame position ?f is determined by the coordinate system.\n\nTo reach the continuity of the first derivative of the gas-phase temperature at\n\n? ? ?? the correction ?(?)(1)g has to be solved.

Then, the heat transfer between the\n\nphases is negligible at the gas-phase diffusion length scale. This is not true for small\n\nequivalence ratios. In these cases, the small flame velocities increase the heat transfer\n\nparameter N and the heat transfer between the phases becomes relevant.\n\n3.3.4 Inner zone: reaction region O(???1)\n\nThis problem corresponds to the situation described in Fig. 3.1d, where, in a region\n\nof the order of ???1 around the flame, the variables present a variation of the order\n\nof ?.

This is done to\n\nnormalize the equations and boundary conditions, simplifying the analytical solution.\n\nSubstituting Eq. (3.46) into the conservation equations Eqs.

(3.51)\n\n\n\n58\n\nAs already discussed in the section describing the length-scales, the reaction region\n\nin flames within porous media is shorter than that for free flames. This is due to the\n\nincreased gas-phase temperatures at the flame found in the combustion within porous\n\nmedia, resulting in higher reaction rates.\n\nIn the characteristic length-scale of the order of ???1 around the flame, the heat\n\ntransfer from the gas-phase to the solid-phase is negligible (?N/?2? ? 1) compared\n\nto the heat transfer in the solid-phase from the equilibrium zone to the frozen zone.\n\nTherefore, ?\n(1)\ns = C\n\n(1)? and, from the energy conservation, C(1) = C\n(?)\n2 /??.\n\nFollowing [87], an analysis of the system of equations (3.47) to (3.50) leads to the\n\nchoice ? = dF and p = ln( \u00af2Daf ).

(3.55)\n\nFrom the conservation of energy at the flame d+? + d\n?\n? = dF = ?, then\n\nm = d+? /(d\n+\n? + d\n\n?\n? ). (3.56)\n\nCombining the gas-phase energy and fuel conservation equations, Eq. (3.52), and\n\napplying the boundary conditions Eqs. (3.53) to (3.55), we obtain ?\n(1)\ng = y\n\n(1)\nF . Thus,\n\nthe problem in the reaction region reduces to finding the solution of\n\nd2y\n(1)\nF\n\nd?2\n=\n\n1\n\n2\ny\n\n(1)\nF exp[?(y\n\n(1)\nF + m?)], (3.57)\n\nwith the boundary conditions given by Eqs. (3.53) and (3.55). Since these boundary\n\nconditions impose only the derivatives of the function, the solution has to suffer a\n\ndisplacement in the coordinate axis in order to match with the solution of the second\n\npre-heating region. By integrating Eq. (3.53), this displacement n is given by\n\nn = lim\n????\n\n(y\n(1)\nF + ?).\n\nThe displacement n has to be equal to the translation imposed in Eq. (3.46),\n\nn = ?p/m. Then, from the definition of p, we have\n\nln(2Daf ) = ?mn.\n\n\n\n60\n\nSubstituting the Damko?hler definition in the last expression and isolating sF , we\n\nfound the first-order estimative for the flame speed as follows\n\ns2F =\n2A?2f?gYOnT\n\na\ngf exp(??/?)\n\n(?2n cp)\n\n(\n?2LeF (1 ??)\n\nd2F\n\n)\n\u00d7\n\nexp\n\n{\n??(1 ??(?)gf )\n\n1 ??(1 ??(?)gf )\n+ mn\n\n}\n, (3.58)\n\nin which\n\nmn = 1.344m? 4m2(1 ?m)/(1 ? 2m)\n\n+3m3 ? ln(1 ? 4m2), for ? 0.2 &lt;m &lt;0.5. (3.59)\n\nEquation (3.59) is an approximation of the numerical solution of Eq. (3.57) with\n\nthe boundary conditions given by Eqs. (3.53) and (3.54) - see [87] for details. The\n\nvalue of m can be found from the solutions for the gas-phase temperature and is equal\n\nto\n\nm =\n(1 + ?rec)/2\n\n??/N + 1\n=\n\n(1 + ?rec)/2\n\nN?[?(1 ??)/?)]/4 + 1\n. (3.60)\n\nFrom Eq. (3.56), is possible to see that the parameter m is the ratio of the energy\n\nflux downstream from the flame, d+? , to the total energy released by the combustion\n\nprocess, (d?? +d\n+\n? ). Note that in combustion within a porous-medium, the value of m is\n\nbounded by 0 ? m ? 0.5. The limit m = 0 corresponds to a freely propagating flame\n\nwhere there is no excess enthalpy. Thus, the excess of enthalpy requires m > 0. The\n\nlimit m = 0.5 corresponds to a situation in which the heat loss to the equilibrium\n\nzone is equal to that to the frozen zone and under this condition the flame is not\n\nstable, i.e., there is extinction.\n\nAn expression for the flame velocity sF divided by the laminar free-flame velocity\n\n\n\n61\n\ns0F [Eq.

(3.61)\n\nIn this compact result, the effect of the porous media on the flame velocity is\n\nfound to be a function of N?, ? and ? only. The effect of ? and LeF is included in\n\nthe free-flame parameters s0F , ? and ?.\n\n3.3.5 Model summary\n\nA closed form approximate solution for the structure and propagation velocity of\n\nadiabatic stationary premixed flames in porous inert media is obtained. The temper-\n\nature profile of the solid-phase is given by Eq. (3.19), in which the temperature of the\n\nsolid-phase at the flame, given by Eq. (3.20) is used. The temperature profile of the\n\ngas-phase is described by Eqs. (3.21), (3.40), (3.43) and (3.45). The fuel and oxidant\n\nconsumption profiles are given by Eqs. (3.38) and (3.39). The heat recirculation\n\nefficiency is given by Eq. (3.25). The flame velocity is evaluated by Eq. (3.58), in\n\nwhich Eqs. (3.59) and (3.60) are used. Under the considered hypothesis, a parameter\n\nthat universalizes the flame properties for the premixed combustion in porous media\n\nis given by Eq. (3.27).\n\nThis set of equations predicts, under the simplifying assumptions used, the main\n\ncharacteristics of flames in porous media for N ? ? and ?/(1 ? ?) ? O(1). In the\n\nnext section the model will be explored to evaluate the influence of the equivalence\n\nratio, the ratio of the solid-phase thermal conductivity to that of the gas-phase, the\n\nporosity of the medium and the fuel Lewis number on such flames.\n\n\n\n62\n\n3.4 Discussion\n\nThe reaction rate parameters were adjusted to give a reasonable agreement with\n\nmeasured laminar flame speeds for methane-air free flames with equivalence ratios\n\nranging from 0.6 to 0.8 [93]. A constant volumetric heat transfer coefficient hv is\n\nestimated following Fu et al. [21]. The gas-phase properties were approximated by\n\nthe air properties evaluated at 1300 K. The heat of reaction was adjusted to reproduce\n\nthe adiabatic flame temperature for ? = 0.8. Transport and geometric properties of\n\nthe solid-phase are typical of porous burners [2, 26]. Table 3.1 shows the parameters\n\nand properties used in the calculations. Results for ? = 0.8, ? = 60, ? = 0.8 and\n\nLeF = 1 are also shown as an example. For simplicity, the fuel Lewis number is equal\n\nto unity for all the calculated results, except when its effect on the heat recirculation\n\nefficiency is analyzed.\n\nThe model is valid for ?/(1 ? ?) ? O(1). Nevertheless, good results are found\n\neven for porosities as high as 0.8, as will be shown in this section. Another condition\n\nimposed is N ? ?. This will not hold for extremely lean mixtures where lower flame\n\nvelocities are found and the interphase heat transfer at the gas-phase diffusion length-\n\nscale becomes important. This is the reason why the discussion will be restricted to\n\n? ? 0.6. The model fails for equivalence ratios near unity because, in this case,\n\nthe oxidant concentration (1 ? ?) in Eq. (3.58) tends to zero. In order to reach\n\nthe stoichiometric mixture it would be necessary to solve the first correction for the\n\noxidant mass fraction y\n(1)\nO . This is the reason why the discussion will be additionally\n\nrestricted to ? ? 0.8.\n\n\n\n63\n\nTable 3.1: Properties and parameters used in the calculations and results for ? = 0.8,\n? = 0.8, ? = 60 and Le = 1.\n\nProperties and Parameters Results\nRu 8.314 J(mol K)\n\n?1 ?s 4.783 W(m K)\n?1\n\nEa 1.77 \u00d7 105 J mol?1 Tr 1996 K\nA 2.20 \u00d7 1012 m3(kg s)?1 Tgf? 698 K\na 0 Tgf+ 2388 K\nQ 4.525 \u00d7 107 J kg?1 Tsf 1343 K\ncp 1187 J(kg K)\n\n?1 sF 0.82 m s\n?1\n\n?g 0.0797 W(m K)\n?1 ? 0.85\n\n?n 1.185 kg m\n?3 ? 9.07\n\nhv 2.0 \u00d7 105 W(m3 K)?1 N 0.718\nTn 298 K N? 17.83\n\n? 0.8 Daf 0.494\n? 0.8 m 9.06 \u00d7 10?3\n? 60 n 1.344\nLeF 1 ?rec 0.2304\n\n? 0.1577\n\n3.4.1 Flame structure\n\nFigure 3.2 shows the flame structure for ? = 0.8, ? = 60 and ? = 0.8 as a function of\n\nthe transformed space coordinate ?. The range used for the spatial scale represents\n\nthe solution of the problem of O(1), in which the solid conduction, the gas convection\n\nand the interphase heat transfer are the dominant processes. The flame can be seen as\n\na sheet where the fuel mass fraction and gas temperature profiles are discontinuous.\n\nUpstream from the flame there is the first pre-heating region and downstream from\n\nthe flame there is the re-equilibrium region. For these conditions the gas tempera-\n\nture exceeds the adiabatic limit by 23%, which corresponds to the heat recirculation\n\nefficiency given by Eq. (3.25). Figure 3.3 shows the same result as Fig. 3.2 with a\n\n\n\n64\n\nrange for the spatial scale that represents the solution of the problem of O(??1). It\n\nis possible to observe the solution in the second pre-heating region connecting the\n\ndiscontinuous profiles of ?\n(0)\ng and y\n\n(0)\nF across the flame. Note that the first derivatives\n\nof both curves are discontinuous since the solution of the innermost scale provides an\n\nexpression for the flame velocity only. Comparing Figs. 3.2 and 3.3 it is seen that the\n\nthermal affected region, i.e., the sum of the lengths of the first pre-heating region and\n\nthe re-equilibrium region (which corresponds to lS), is much larger than the second\n\npre-heating region (lG), as a consequence of the high thermal conductivity of the solid\n\nmatrix.\n\nFigure 3.2: Non-dimensional gas- and solid-phase temperatures and fuel mass fraction\nprofile (solution of the O(1) problem).\n\n\n\n65\n\nFigure 3.3: Non-dimensional gas- and solid-phase temperatures and fuel mass fraction\nprofile (solution of the O(??1) problem).\n\n3.4.2 Influence of the equivalence ratio and ?\n\nFigure 3.4 shows the interphase heat transfer parameter N as a function of ? and ? for\n\n? = 0.8. The increase of N with the increasing values of ? is in accordance with the\n\ndefinition of N, since the heat transfer parameter is proportional to ? via the solid-\n\nphase conductivity ?s. Also, for any ?, the heat transfer parameter N decreases as ?\n\nincreases. This can be understood by recalling that N is proportional to 1/s2F and that\n\nhigher flame velocities are found for higher equivalence ratios. Then, higher values of\n\nN are found for leaner mixtures and higher solid-phase thermal conductivities. Note,\n\nhowever, that for ? = 20 and ? = 0.8 the results are at the limit for the validity of\n\nthe model.\n\n\n\n66\n\nFigure 3.4: Interphase heat transfer parameter N as a function of ? and ?.\n\nFigures 3.5 to 3.8 show the effect of ? and ? on other flame parameters. The\n\nsolid-phase temperature at the flame ?\n(0)\ns (?f ), depicted in Fig. 3.5, is proportional to\n\n?\nN according to Eq. (3.20). Then, ?\n\n(0)\ns (?f ) also increases for leaner mixtures and\n\nhigher solid-phase thermal conductivities. In the range of analysis, it varied from 0.59\n\nto 0.69, agreeing with the limits 1/2 &lt;?\n(0)\ns (?f ) &lt;1, as already pointed out.\n\nThe heat recirculation efficiency ?rec, shown in Fig. 3.6, is also proportional\n\nto\n?\nN, according to Eqs. (3.26) and (3.27). Then, ?rec increases as ? increases\n\nand as ? decreases. Note that ?rec also represents the gas-phase temperature at the\n\nupstream side of the flame, ?\n(0)\ng (?\n\n?\nf ), or the excess temperature in the gas-phase at the\n\ndownstream side of the flame, ?\n(0)\ng (?\n\n+\nf ) = 1 + ?rec as stated by Eqs. (3.28) and (3.29).\n\nIn the range of analysis, the maximum gas temperature at the flame is 17 to 38%\n\n\n\n67\n\nFigure 3.5: Non-dimensional solid-phase temperature at the flame ?\n(0)\ns (?f ) as a func-\n\ntion of ? and ?.\n\nhigher than the adiabatic flame temperature, or, in other words, 17 to 38% of the total\n\nenergy released by the combustion process has been recirculated to the unburnt gases.\n\nPrevious works [70, 69] have shown that the use of one-step global mechanisms for the\n\nchemical kinetics over-predicts the superadiabatic flame temperatures for equivalence\n\nratios near stoichiometry. For leaner mixtures such mechanisms yield better results.\n\nThe same trends are found for the ratio sF/s\n0\nF , Eq. (3.61), shown in Fig. 3.7. The\n\nratio sF/s\n0\nF increases as the equivalence ratio is decreased since higher recirculation\n\nefficiencies are found. This occurs since, due to higher heat recirculation, the flame\n\nreaches (proportionally) higher gas-phase temperatures with respect to the adiabatic\n\nlimit, leading to higher flame velocities with respect to the laminar free-flame velocity\n\n\n\n68\n\nFigure 3.6: Heat recirculation efficiency ?rec as a function of ? and ?.\n\ns0F . In the range of analysis, sF is 2.3 to 6.5 times larger than the corresponding free\n\nflame velocity. Note that, in order to calculate the mass flow rate for flames in porous\n\nmedia, mg, one must consider the effect of the reduced area to the gas-phase flow\n\nthrough the solid matrix. Then, mg/m\n0\ng = ?sF/s\n\n0\nF , where m\n\n0\ng is the mass flow rate\n\nfor free flames.\n\nFigure 3.8 shows the ratio lR/l\n0\nR, i.e., the reaction length-scale for flames within\n\nporous media non-dimensionalized by the reaction length-scale for free flames, as a\n\nfunction of ? and ?. The reaction region for flames within porous media is shorter\n\nwhen the heat recirculation is higher as a result of the increase in the flame velocity\n\n(one should remember that in Eq. (3.51) sF increases with ?rec). In the range of\n\nanalysis, lR varies between 26 to 57% of l\n0\nR.\n\n\n\n69\n\nFigure 3.7: Ratio sF /s\n0\nF as a function of ? and ?.\n\n3.4.3 Influence of the matrix porosity\n\nFigures 3.9 and 3.10 show the effect of the porosity ? on the flame parameters for\n\n? = 0.8 and ? = 60. As ? is decreased, the effect of the solid-phase becomes more\n\nimportant since there is more solid-phase in the matrix. As a consequence, more heat\n\nis transported by the solid, thus increasing the heat recirculated, as depicted in Fig.\n\n3.9. This can be seen examining the dependence of ?rec with ? in Eqs. (3.26) and\n\n(3.27). When ? tends to unity, ?rec tends to zero and when ? tends to zero ?rec tends to\n\nunity. Nevertheless, when ? tends to unity the intramedium radiation heat transfer\n\nbecomes more important and the Rosseland approximation could not be assumed.\n\nSince the heat recirculation increases for lower porosities, lR decreases and ?\n(0)\ns (?f )\n\n\n\n70\n\nFigure 3.8: Ratio lR/l\n0\nR as a function of ? and ?.\n\nincreases. The same tendency is found for the ratio sF/s\n0\nF in Fig. 3.10, i.e., the flame\n\nvelocity increases as ? decreases as a result of the higher heat recirculation. The heat\n\ntransfer parameter N decreases when the porosity is decreased since it is proportional\n\nto 1/s2F .\n\nWhen ? ? 1 the model tends to the free flame solution, i.e., the temperature\n\nat the downstream side of the flame, ?\n(0)\ng (?\n\n+\nf ), is unity over the entire range of ?,\n\n?\n(0)\ns (?f ) is 1/2, its lower value according to Eq. (3.20), the flame velocity equals\n\nthe adiabatic free flame velocity (sF = s\n0\nF ), the reaction length-scale equals the free\n\nflame reaction length-scale (lR = l\n0\nR) and, as was already seen above, ?rec tends to\n\nzero. Nevertheless, in this limit, the solid temperature and the heat recirculation are\n\n\n\n71\n\nFigure 3.9: Dependence of ?rec, ?\n(0)\ns (?f ) and lR/l\n\n0\nR on ?.\n\nmeaningless since there is no interphase heat exchange. Although these tendencies\n\nare correct, the model is not valid in this limit.\n\n3.4.4 Influence of the Lewis number\n\nUntil now the discussion was restricted to LeF = 1. The effect of a different fuel\n\nLewis number on the heat recirculation efficiency is shown in Fig. 3.11. The heat\n\nrecirculation efficiency slightly increases as LeF decreases. This occurs because sF\n\ndecreases as LeF is decreased, according to Eq. (3.58), thus leading to higher values\n\nof N and ?rec.\n\n\n\n72\n\nFigure 3.10: Dependence of the ratio sF /s\n0\nF and N on ?.\n\n3.4.5 The porous-media-flame number\n\nTherefore, in the range of analysis, the characteristics of the superadiabatic combus-\n\ntion in porous media will be more pronounced for lower equivalence ratios, higher\n\nsolid-phase conductivities, lower matrix porosities and lower fuel Lewis numbers.\n\nCombinations among these four parameters define the heat recirculation induced\n\nby the matrix and, consequently, the superadiabatic effect. Under the hypotheses\n\nconsidered, the porous-media-flame number N?, given by Eq. (3.27), summarizes\n\nthese effects and defines the state of reacting flows within porous media. Figure\n\n3.12 shows the variation of ? with ? and ? for N? = 20. As indicated at the cap-\n\ntion, the data shown in the figure have identical values of the variables at the flame,\n\n\n\n73\n\nFigure 3.11: Heat recirculation efficiency ?rec as a function of LeF .\n\n?rec = ?g(?\n?\nf ) = 0.218, ?g(?\n\n+\nf ) = 1.218 and ?s(?f ) = 0.609.\n\n3.4.6 Comparison with a numerical solution\n\nFigure 3.13 shows a comparison between the present model and a numerical solution\n\nof Eqs. (2.39) to (2.43) for ? = 0.8, ? = 60, ? = 0.8 and LeF = 1. The numerical\n\nsolution was obtained using a finite-volume method, with non-uniform adapting grid\n\nand steps were taken to accelerate convergence to steady-state [94]. The flame speed\n\n(eigenvalue) was obtained from the overall mass balance. The algorithm used the\n\nsame properties and parameters listed in Table 3.1. From Fig. 3.13, it is observed\n\nthat the asymptotic model overestimates the heat recirculation and the gas-phase\n\n\n\n74\n\nFigure 3.12: Variation of ? with ? and ? for N? = 20.\n\ntemperature at the flame. The flame velocity calculated numerically is 25% larger\n\nthan the analytical prediction. The discrepancies between the two solutions are due\n\nto the simplifications assumed in the asymptotic model. For instance, in the prob-\n\nlem of the order of unity, the thermal diffusion is neglected in the gas-phase. This\n\napproximation fails near the flame, where considerable temperature gradients occur,\n\nand could explain the observed discrepancies. As a result of this simplification, the\n\ntemperature of the gas-phase in the upstream side of the flame and, consequently,\n\nthe heat recirculation, are over-estimated by the analytical model. Furthermore, in\n\nthe problem of the order of ??1, the surface convection has been neglected, then, at\n\nthe downstream side of the flame, the gas-phase temperature is also over-estimated\n\n\n\n75\n\nbecause of the high heat recirculation and the reduced heat loss to the solid-phase.\n\nNevertheless, even with a higher temperature at the flame, the analytical model pre-\n\ndicts a lower flame velocity. This may be due to the simplifications inherent to the\n\nhigh activation energy asymptotic method employed to analyze the reaction region.\n\nIn the framework of the simple one-step reaction model, a rough approximation of\n\nthe flame velocity could be expected only. Nevertheless, the analytical model is able\n\nto qualitatively follow the main characteristics of the flame. Note also that in Fig.\n\n3.13 the profiles are shown against the non-dimensional spatial variable ?, that is\n\na function of the flame velocity. Figure 3.14 brings the comparison in dimensional\n\nvariables, showing that the solid-phase temperature is fairly well predicted by the an-\n\nalytical model. The quality of the solution could be improved by solving additional\n\nterms of the asymptotic expansion Eq. (3.10). Nevertheless, this improvement is of\n\nminor interest in the context of the present work. An extension of this work with a\n\nmore detailed model for the chemical kinetics, e.g., a four-step kinetic model, would\n\nimprove the results.\n\n3.5 Conclusions\n\nThis chapter presented an asymptotic solution for an infinite, adiabatic porous burner\n\nconsidering three different characteristic length-scales: the solid-phase diffusion length-\n\nscale (lS), where the solid-phase heat conduction, gas-phase convection and interphase\n\nheat transfer dominate the problem, the gas-phase diffusion length-scale (lG), where\n\nthe gas-phase convection and diffusion dominate the problem, and the reaction length-\n\nscale (lR), where reaction and gas-phase diffusion dominate the problem. Explicit so-\n\nlutions for the gas and solid temperatures and for the fuel and oxidant consumption\n\n\n\n76\n\nFigure 3.13: Comparison of the present model to a numerical solution.\n\nwere found as function of the problem parameters for the lS and lG characteristic\n\nlength-scales. The description of the problem in the reaction length-scale leads to an\n\napproximated expression for the flame velocity.\n\nThe model was used to analyze the influence of the equivalence ratio ?, the con-\n\nductivities ratio ?, the matrix porosity ? and the fuel Lewis number LeF on the\n\nflame structure. The combinations among these four parameters define the heat re-\n\ncirculation induced by the matrix and, consequently, the superadiabatic effect. The\n\nresults showed that the influence of the porous medium on the flame is to increase\n\nits temperature and velocity. That influence is more pronounced for leaner mixtures,\n\nhigher solid-phase thermal conductivities (higher ?), lower porosities and lower fuel\n\nLewis numbers. Under the hypotheses considered in this work, a number that brings\n\n\n\n77\n\nFigure 3.14: Comparison of the present model to a numerical solution in dimensional\nvariables.\n\ntogether the effects of all these parameters, characterizing the flame variables and\n\nuniversalizing the results, is identified. For this reason, this number is called the\n\nporous-media-flame number.\n\nThe thermal affected region (lS) is larger than the gas-phase diffusion length-scale\n\n(lG) as a result of the high thermal conductivity of the solid matrix. For example,\n\nmaximum gas-phase temperatures up to 38% above the corresponding adiabatic free-\n\nflame temperature and flame velocities up to 6.5 times the corresponding adiabatic\n\nfree-flame velocity are found for ? = 0.6, ? = 120, ? = 0.8 and LeF = 1. It is also\n\nshown that the reaction region is shorter in flames within porous media, lR &lt;l\n0\nR,\n\n\n\n78\n\nsince higher flame temperatures are found.\n\nDue to the simplifications assumed by the model, the solution fails for extremely\n\nlean mixtures, when the heat transfer parameters N is large, for equivalence ratios\n\nnear unity, because of the simplified solution for the reaction region, and for very high\n\nporosities (? ? 1), since, in this case, the scale separation assumed by the model is\n\nnot applicable. These limits will be addressed in the next chapters.\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nAsymptotic solution for ultra-lean\nmixtures\n\nIn this chapter, the method of matched asymptotic expansions is employed to the\n\ncase of extremely lean mixtures, where the interphase heat transfer is intense.\n\n4.1 Introduction\n\nUltra-lean premixed flames within infinite adiabatic porous inert media are charac-\n\nterized by low flame velocities that result in intense interphase heat transfer, which in\n\nturn leads to thermal equilibrium between the gas and solid phases in a wide region\n\naround the flame. The present analysis will show that this thermal equilibrium limits\n\nthe superadiabatic effect and will reveal thermal aspects of the lean flammability limit\n\nfor the flame propagation in porous inert media.\n\nThere is a lack of studies concerning the steady-state ultra-lean operation of porous\n\nburners [5]. In an experimental and numerical study of radiant porous burners per-\n\nformance, Hsu et al. [13] obtained stable flames at equivalence ratios as low as 0.41\n\nfor methane-air flames, which is smaller than the lean flammability limit for free\n\n79\n\n\n\n80\n\nmethane-air flames, ? = 0.46 [68]. The results showed that there is a decreasing\n\nflow rate range where stable flames can be sustained as the mixture is made leaner.\n\nBelow a certain value of the equivalence ratio (? ? 0.55) the burner heat loss was the\n\ndominating factor in determining the minimum flow rate for stable flames. In these\n\ncases, the flame did not present flash-back, instead, it just extinguished when the\n\nflow rate was decreased. Although the experiments could not reach the flammability\n\nlimit, the authors hypothesized that at this limit there is only one flow rate that leads\n\nto a stable flame. For this flow rate, the energy released by the combustion process\n\nis just large enough to yeld the temperature required to maintain the chemical re-\n\nactions. This means that, for the ultra-lean operation of radiant burners, the lean\n\nflammability limit is determined by a balance between heat losses and heat recircu-\n\nlation. Experimental and numerical studies report stable flames below the standard\n\nfree-flame lean flammability limit [12, 17, 51, 95]. It is expected that, for perfectly\n\nadiabatic burners, the lean limit for the flame propagation will be found for much\n\nlower equivalence ratios than in radiant burners. Other experimental works report\n\nultra-lean combustion in porous inert media [8, 11, 96], but some kind of external\n\nheat recirculation is used.\n\nUltra-lean combustion is also achieved in low-velocity forward filtration combus-\n\ntion in porous inert media [36, 97]. In these cases the reaction front propagates at low\n\nvelocities (less than 1 mm/s) and the flame can be sustained for equivalence ratios\n\nas low as 0.15. The interaction of the combustion wave with the thermal wave can\n\nlead the flame to reach temperatures as high as 2.8 times the corresponding adiabatic\n\nflame limit [36]. This is not the case for stationary flames. As it will be shown in the\n\npresent analysis, the nondimensional flame temperature based on the thermodynamic\n\n\n\n81\n\nlimit decreases as the flammability limit is approached.\n\nIn the ultra-rich side of the equivalence ratio range, Schoegl and Ellzey [98] de-\n\nveloped an analytical model for the combustion of methane-air mixtures in conduct-\n\ning tubes of finite length. Co-flow and counterflow configurations in parallel tubes\n\nwere evaluated. Stable solutions were obtained for equivalence ratios up to 2.8 in\n\nthe counter-flow case, which is far beyond the standard rich flammability limit for\n\nmethane-air flames (? = 1.64 [68]). Two solutions were obtained, one corresponding\n\nto high flame velocities and the other corresponding to slow flames velocities. The\n\nrich flammability limit for the two configurations was not determined, but the results\n\nshowed that the range of flow rates in which stable flames are obtained decreases as\n\nthe equivalence ratio is increased.\n\nIn the previous chapter, an asymptotic solution was proposed for equivalence ratios\n\nranging from 0.60 to 0.80. The upper bound was the result of the simplifications\n\ninvolved in the one-step kinetic mechanism used. The lower bound is related to\n\ninterphase heat transfer parameter that was not allowed to increase, i.e., N ? ?. For\n\nsmall values of N, the interphase heat transfer at the gas-phase and at the reaction\n\nlength-scales is negligible. Then, the flame structure at the inner scales is similar to\n\nthat of a free-flame. This will not hold for extremely lean mixtures where lower flame\n\nvelocities are found.\n\nThis chapter aims to extend the previous results to lower equivalence ratios where\n\nthe condition N ? O(?) prevails. Higher values of N result in local thermal equilib-\n\nrium between the phases in a wide region around the flame. This intense interphase\n\nheat transfer limits the superadiabatic effect, showing that the superadiabatic flame\n\ntemperature should have a maximum at the lean side of the equivalence ratio range.\n\n\n\n82\n\nThe model also provides a first approximation for the lean flammability limit for the\n\nflame propagation in adiabatic porous inert media based on thermal considerations.\n\nIn this case, since there is no influence of heat losses, the lean flammability limit is\n\ndetermined only by the heat recirculation that is a function of the solid- and gas-phase\n\nproperties.\n\n4.2 Length scales\n\nFigure 4.1 shows a schematic representation of the problem under consideration. Since\n\nwe are dealing with extremely lean mixtures with very low flame velocities, the gas and\n\nsolid phases have enough contact time to reach thermal equilibrium in a wide region\n\naround the flame. This region corresponds to the characteristic solid-phase diffusion\n\nlength-scale lS. In a thin region around the flame there is still considerable thermal\n\nnonequilibrium between the phases. This region corresponds to the characteristic gas-\n\nphase diffusion length-scale lG. The ratio between this two scales is lG/lS = ?/?(1??).\n\nAs in the previous work, the present model is restricted to ?/(1??) ? O(1), ensuring\n\nthe scales separation (lG/lS = 1/?).\n\nAs the equivalence ratio decreases, the large contact time between the phases\n\ncauses an intense heat transfer from the gas-phase to the solid-phase at the length-\n\nscale lG. Then, contrary to the previous model, the nondimensional flame temperature\n\ndecreases as the mixture is made leaner. Since the flame velocity is proportional to\n\nthe Lewis number, the same results are found when the Lewis number is decreased.\n\nThese behaviors are particular of ultra-lean premixed combustion in porous inert\n\nmedia. This is due to a change in the direction of the interphase heat transfer. In\n\nthe previous model, the interphase heat transfer is important just at the solid-phase\n\n\n\n83\n\nFigure 4.1: Schematic representation of the temperatures and fuel mass fraction dis-\ntributions and the different characteristic length-scales of the problem.\n\nlength-scale lS where the solid-phase looses heat to the gas-phase. In the present\n\nmodel, the interphase heat transfer in the gas-phase length-scale lG is not negligible,\n\nand now is the gas-phase that looses heat to the solid-phase. This change in the heat\n\ntransfer direction is the origin of the particular behavior of the ultra-lean combustion\n\nin porous inert media.\n\nThe description of the reaction region lR is identical to the previous model since\n\nthe interphase heat transfer in this region is still negligible. As in the previous model,\n\nthe two innermost scales behave as a subgrid model, with the difference that now the\n\ninterphase heat transfer at the gas-phase scale is no longer negligible.\n\n4.3 Mathematical formulation\n\nThe nondimensional conservation equations obtained in the previous chapter, Eqs.\n\n(3.1) to (3.4), are the starting point of the present analysis.\n\n\n\n84\n\n4.3.1 Outer zone: problem of the order of unity\n\nIn the characteristic length scale ? ? ?f ? O(1), the diffusive terms in the gas-phase\n\nare of the order of ??1, the interphase heat transfer parameter N is of the order of ?\n\nand the reaction is exponentially small. Thus, Eqs. (3.1) to (3.4) take the form\n\n?\ndyF\nd?\n\n=\n?\n\nLeF ?\n\nd2yF\nd?2\n\n, (4.1)\n\n?\ndyO\nd?\n\n=\n?\n\nLeO ?\n\nd2yO\nd?2\n\n, (4.2)\n\n?\nd?g\nd?\n\n=\n?\n\n?\n\nd2?g\nd?2\n\n+ N(?s ??g), (4.3)\n\n0 = (1 ??)\nd2?s\nd?2\n?N(?s ??g). (4.4)\n\nThe solution of Eqs.

(4.5)\n\nSubstituting Eq. (4.5) into Eq. (4.1) to (4.4) and applying the limit ? ? ? (\n\nN ??), the first approximation for the set of equations of the order of unity is\n\ndy\n(0)\nF\n\nd?\n= 0, (4.6)\n\ndy\n(0)\nO\n\nd?\n= 0, (4.7)\n\n?(0)s = ?\n(0)\ng = ?\n\n(0). (4.8)\n\nThe boundary conditions for ? ? ?? are ?(0) = 0 and y(0)F = y\n(0)\nO = 1 and for ?\n\n? +? are ?(0) = 1 and y(0)F = y\n(0)\nO ? (1 ? ?) = 0. The solution for Eqs.

(4.8), one finds\n\nd?(0)\n\nd?\n=\n\n(\n1 ??\n?\n\n)\nd2?(0)\n\nd?2\n. (4.9)\n\nEquation (4.9) is equivalent to the one-equation model for the energy conservation\n\nwith effective properties [44]. Integrating Eq. (4.9) and applying the proper boundary\n\nconditions, one finds the first approximation for the temperature profile in the region\n\nwith thermal equilibrium between the two phases\n\n?(0) =\n\n{\nexp{(? ? ?f ) [?/(1 ??)]}, for ? ? ?f,\n1, for ? ? ?f.\n\n(4.10)\n\nNote that, since local thermal equilibrium is assumed in this scale, superadiabatic\n\nflame temperatures are not possible. This solution is similar to a free-flame solution\n\nwith the mean properties of an homogeneous medium composed by the gas and the\n\nsolid phases. Equation (4.10) is the kind of solution obtained when the one-equation\n\nmodel for the energy conservation is employed to solve the problem of combustion\n\nwithin porous inert media.\n\nNow, collecting the terms of the order of ??1 one finds the equation for the first\n\ncorrection for the temperature as(\n1 ? ?\n?\n\n)\nd2?(1)\n\nd?2\n?\nd?(1)\n\nd?\n= ?\n\nd2?(0)\n\nd?2\n, (4.11)\n\nwhere the condition ?\n(1)\ng = ?\n\n(1)\ns = ?\n\n(1) is still valid since N ??.\n\nThe boundary conditions for the first correction are ?(1) ? 0 in ? ? ?? and\n\n?(1) ? 0 in ? ? +?. Integrating Eq. (4.11) with Eq. (4.10) the solution for the first\n\ncorrection gives\n\n?(1) =\n\n{\n? [?/(1 ??)]2 (? ? ?f ) exp{[?/(1 ??)] (? ? ?f )}, for ? ? ?f,\n0, for ? ? ?f.\n\n(4.12)\n\n\n\n86\n\n4.3.2 Inner zone: problem of the order of ??1\n\nIn this thin region gas and solid phases do not have enough contact time to reach\n\nthermal equilibrium. Superadiabatic temperatures are expected to arise, but are\n\nlimited by the intense interphase heat transfer.\n\nIn this zone, the variation of the nondimensional variables is of the order of unity\n\nalong a characteristic length of the order of ??1 around the flame, except for the\n\nsolid-phase temperature that presents just a small variation of the order of ??1. The\n\nvariables in this thin zone are denoted by y\n(?)\nF , y\n\n(?)\nO , ?\n\n(?)\ns and ?\n\n(?)\ng .\n\nThe expansion for the variables can be written as\n\ny\n(?)\nF = y\n\n(?)(0)\nF + ?\n\n?1y\n(?)(1)\nF + o(?\n\n?1)\n\ny\n(?)\nO = y\n\n(?)(0)\nO + ?\n\n?1y\n(?)(1)\nO + o(?\n\n?1)\n\n?\n(?)\ns = 1 ? ??1?(?)(1)s + o(??1)\n?\n\n(?)\ng = ?\n\n(?)(0)\ng + ?\n\n?1?\n(?)(1)\ng + o(?\n\n?1)\n\n???????\n??????\n. (4.13)\n\nNote that the solid-phase temperature has been approximated to the unity at\n\nthe leading order. To justify this choice, the limit N ? ? is taken in Eq. (3.20),\n\nresulting in ?\n(?)\ns ? 1 at the flame. This means that the present model is valid for flames\n\nin which the solid-phase at the flame presents a small deviation from the adiabatic\n\nlimit. With this assumption, the two phases are decoupled at the leading order for\n\nthis length-scale, as will be seen next.\n\nBy rescaling the spatial coordinate as ?(? ? ?f ) = ?, defining N ? N0? with N0\n\nbeing a parameter of the order of unity, substituting the asymptotic expansions (4.13)\n\ninto the conservation equations (3.1) to (3.4) and collecting the higher order terms,\n\nthe governing equations become\n\n?\ndy\n\n(?)(0)\nF\n\nd?\n=\n\n?\n\nLeF\n\nd2y\n(?)(0)\nF\n\nd?2\n, (4.14)\n\n\n\n87\n\n?\ndy\n\n(?)(0)\nO\n\nd?\n=\n\n?\n\nLeO\n\nd2y\n(?)(0)\nO\n\nd?2\n, (4.15)\n\n?\nd?\n\n(?)(0)\ng\n\nd?\n= ?\n\nd2?\n(?)(0)\ng\n\nd?2\n+ N0(1 ??(?)(0)g ), (4.16)\n\n0 = (1 ??)\nd2?\n\n(?)(1)\ns\n\nd?2\n?N0(1 ??(?)(0)g ). (4.17)\n\nThe boundary conditions are determined when the solution corresponding to the\n\nproblem of the order of unity (???f = O(1)) is matched with the problem of the order\n\nof ??1. Thus, in the unburned region, i.e., upstream from the flame, for ? ? ??,\n\nd?\n(?)\ng /d? and d?\n\n(?)\ns /d? are equal to ?\n\n?1d?(0)/d? evaluated at ?f .

At the flame, the gas- and\n\nsolid-phase temperatures, ?\n(?)\ngf and ?\n\n(?)\nsf , are unknowns to be determined.\n\nThe solution of Eqs.

(4.27)\n\nEquation (4.24) is the first approximation for the gas-phase temperature at the\n\nflame, where ?sup, Eq. (4.25), is the excess temperature at the flame, i.e., the temper-\n\nature above the adiabatic limit, which is similar to the heat recirculation efficiency\n\ndefined in Eq. (3.25). It is possible to verify that ?sup depends only on the parameter\n\nN?. Then, the superadiabatic effect is more pronounced for lower values of N0, i.e.,\n\nless heat transfer between the phases, and higher values of ?. Equations (4.24) to\n\n(4.26) show that, in a first approximation, the flame temperature does not depend\n\non the solid conductivity. This happens because the solid temperature at the length\n\nscale lG is unity in a first approximation. Therefore, under the conditions considered\n\nin this analysis, (N ? ? ? 1), the interphase heat transfer is the limiting process\n\nthat defines the flame properties.\n\nAs in the previous model, the parameter N? universalizes the results at the flame\n\nin the leading order term, since Eq. (4.24) maintains an explicit dependence only on\n\nN? and ?\n(?)(0)\nsf = 1. Then, the parameter N?, called porous media flame number, is\n\nthe parameter that defines the leading order problem. As in the previous chapter, an\n\nanalogy between the parameter N? and the number of transfer units can be made\n\nN? = 4NTUG and NTUG =\nhvlG\n\n??nsFcp\n. (4.28)\n\nNote that, in the present model, the NUT is based on the gas-phase length-scale lG\n\n(NUTG) and that N? is directly proportional to NTUG. The dependence on lG is\n\nexpected since, in the present model, this is the length-scale where the interphase\n\n\n\n90\n\nheat transfer is important. The inversion of the dependence of N? with NTU - note\n\nthat in the previous chapter they were inversely proportional - is a result of the\n\nintense interphase heat transfer of the present model, a condition that limits the\n\nsuperadiabatic effect, as will be seen in the results.\n\nNow, collecting the terms of the order of ??1 for the gas-phase one finds\n\n?\nd?\n\n(?)(1)\ng\n\nd?\n= ?\n\nd2?\n(?)(1)\ng\n\nd?2\n?N0(?(?)(1)s + ?\n\n(?)(1)\ng ), (4.29)\n\nwhere the boundary conditions are d?\n(?)(1)\ng /d? = ?/(1??) for ? ??? and ?(?)(1)g = 0\n\nfor ? ? ?f .

(4.30)\n\n4.3.3 Inner zone: reaction region O(???1)\n\nIn a region of the order of ???1 around the flame, the variables present a variation of\n\nthe order of ?. The solution follows the same steps already discussed in the previous\n\nsolution for higher equivalence ratios (section 3.3.4). The flame velocity is given by\n\nEq. (3.58), in which the approximation of Eq. (3.59) is still valid. The value of m, the\n\ndownstream nondimensional gas-phase conduction heat flux, can be determined from\n\nthe gas temperature profile given by Eqs. (4.13), (4.21), (4.24) and (4.30) resulting\n\nin\n\nm =\nr2\n\nr1 + r2\n= (1 ??sup)/2. (4.31)\n\nNote that, since for m ? 1/2 there is extinction, as was discussed in the preceding\n\nchapter, the flame temperature needs to be above the adiabatic free-flame temperature\n\nfor the flame propagation to be possible, i.e., ?sup > 0.\n\n\n\n91\n\n4.3.4 Model summary\n\nA closed form approximated solution for the structure and propagation velocity of\n\nultra-lean adiabatic stationary premixed flames in porous inert media is obtained.\n\nThe temperature profile of both phases for the region of thermal equilibrium is given\n\nby Eqs. (4.5), (4.8), (4.10) and (4.12). In the region of thermal nonequilibrium,\n\nthe temperature profile of the gas-phase is described by Eqs. (4.13), (4.21), (4.24)\n\nand (4.30) and the temperature profile of the solid-phase is described by Eqs. (4.13),\n\n(4.22) and (4.23). The fuel and oxidant mass fraction profiles are given by Eqs. (4.18)\n\nand (4.19). The flame velocity is evaluated by Eq. (3.58), in which Eqs. (3.59) and\n\n(4.31) are used.\n\nThis set of equations is able to qualitatively predict, under the limitations imposed\n\nby the kinetic mechanism of one global step, the main characteristics of flames in\n\nporous media for heat transfer parameters N of the order of ?. Another condition\n\nimposed in this solution is ?/(1 ? ?) ? O(1), which ensures the separation of the\n\nlength-scales of the problem. The model is also restricted to the conditions where\n\nthe solid-phase temperature at the flame presents small deviations from the adiabatic\n\nlimit. In the next section the model will be explored to evaluate the influence of the\n\nproblem parameters on such flames.\n\n4.4 Discussion\n\nThe reaction rate parameters were adjusted to yield a reasonable agreement with\n\nmeasured laminar flame speeds for free flames with equivalence ratios ranging from\n\n\n\n92\n\n0.5 to 0.6. The heat of reaction was adjusted to reproduce the adiabatic flame tem-\n\nperature for ? = 0.5 [93]. The gas-phase properties were approximated by the air\n\nproperties evaluated at 1000 K. The volumetric heat transfer coefficient hv is mod-\n\neled following Fu et al. [21], which uses a volumetric Nusselt number, Nuv = C\n?Rem\n\n?\n,\n\nwhere Nuv = hvd\n2\nm/?g and Re is the Reynolds number, Re = ?nundm/\u00b5n. The mean\n\npore diameter is modeled as dm =\n(?\n\n4?/?\n)\n/(39.37?), which is a uniform pore dis-\n\ntribution model, where ? is the linear pore density given in pores per inch (ppi).\n\nNote that, contrary to the previous model, the variations of hv are expressive for\n\nextremely lean mixtures and the present analysis must take it into account. The used\n\ntransport and geometric properties of the solid-phase are typical of porous burners\n\n[2, 26]. Table 4.1 shows the parameters and properties used in the calculations and\n\nsome of the results obtained.\n\n4.4.1 Influence of the equivalence ratio\n\nFigure 4.2 shows the flame velocity sF as a function of ?. The upper branch of\n\nthe curve corresponds to the physical solution and the lower branch corresponds to\n\na non-physical solution (N ? ?). Below ? = 0.217 the parameter m reaches the\n\nlimiting value 0.5 and the steady state flame propagation is not possible. Then, the\n\npresent model indicates that there is a flammability limit for the premixed methane-\n\nair combustion within porous media. For the porous medium under analysis this\n\nlimit is found around ? = 0.217. All the subsequent analysis will be restricted to the\n\nphysical branch of the solution.\n\nFigure 4.3 shows the parameter N0 = N/? as a function of ?. The model is\n\nconstructed for N0 ? O(1), then, we see that the solution is valid for a small range\n\n\n\n93\n\nTable 4.1: Properties and parameters used in the calculations and results for ? =\n0.225, ? = 60, ? = 0.8, ? = 50 ppi and LeF = 1.\n\nProperties and Parameters Results\nRu 8.314 J(mol K)\n\n?1 ?s 4.041 W(m K)\n?1\n\nEa 1.2 \u00d7 105 J mol?1 hv 1.476 \u00d7 104 W (m3 K)?1\nA 1.0 \u00d7 1010 m3(kg s)?1 Tr 838 K\na 0 Tgf 1052.1 K\nQ 4.759 \u00d7 107 J kg?1 Tsf 805.0 K\ncp 1141 J(kg K)\n\n?1 sF 2.252 cm s\n?1\n\n?g 0.06735 W(m K)\n?1 N0 1.072\n\n?n 1.185 kg m\n?3 ? 0.64\n\nTn 298 K ? 11.1\nC? 0.146 Daf 42.74\n\nm? 0.83 Daf 0.3706\n? 0.8 m 0.3017\n? 0.225 n 0.9926\n? 50 ppi ? 0.1421\n? 60 N 64.31\nLeF 1 ?gf 1.397\n\nof equivalence ratios around ? = 0.225. Since N0 is proportional to 1/s\n2\nF , for leaner\n\nmixtures the corresponding lower flame velocities result in higher values of N0 and\n\nfor higher equivalence ratios the higher flame velocities result in lower values of N0.\n\nFigure 4.4 shows the gas and solid-phase temperatures at the flame as a function of\n\n?. Contrary to the previous model, for the condition N ? O(1), the non-dimensional\n\nflame temperature, ?\n(?)\ngf , increases as ? is increased. This is a consequence of Eq.\n\n(4.24), in which ?\n(?)(0)\ngf varies with N\n\n?1/2\n0 . Physically, the reason for this behavior is\n\nthe intense heat transfer from the gas-phase to the solid phase that occurs at the\n\ngas-phase length-scale for leaner mixtures. Lower values of ? result in lower flame\n\nvelocities, thus, there is more time for the interphase heat transfer and the gas-phase\n\n\n\n94\n\nFigure 4.2: The flame velocity sF as function of ?. The upper branch corresponds to\nthe physical solution.\n\ntemperature is limited by the intense heat loss to the solid matrix. As ? is further\n\ndecreased there is a point in which the temperatures at the flame are not high enough\n\nto sustain the flame and a flammability limit is found. As the superadiabatic flame\n\ntemperature decreases, i.e, as ?sup decreases, the heat flux to the downstream side of\n\nthe flame becomes more important and the parameter m tends to the limiting value\n\nof 0.5, according to Eq.(4.31). Then, one can conclude that, to sustain flames at\n\n? smaller than the free-flame flammability limit it is necessary to reach a minimum\n\nsuperadiabatic flame temperature, i.e., ?sup > 0, as discussed in relation to Eq. 4.31.\n\nFor the conditions considered in Fig. 4.4, the temperature at the flame must be at\n\n\n\n95\n\nFigure 4.3: The parameter N0 as a function of ?.\n\nleast 20% above the adiabatic free-flame temperature.\n\nIt is important to recall that, although the present model is based on the one-step\n\nreaction mechanism, this approximation is adequate for this first theoretical approach\n\nsince it permits the adjustment of a few chemical parameters to agree with experi-\n\nments. Despite this and other simplifying assumptions, the results reveal the strong\n\ndependence of the flammability limit for premixed methane-air combustion in porous\n\ninert media on the gas phase temperature at the flame and the matrix properties.\n\nTo improve this prediction, at least a four-step reaction mechanism should be con-\n\nsidered and experiments should be carried out to correctly determine the volumetric\n\ninterphase heat transfer coefficient hv at the flow rates and temperatures of interest.\n\n\n\n96\n\nFigure 4.4: Gas and solid-phase temperatures at the flame as a function of ?.\n\nAdditionally, since in the flammability limit the value of N0 is much higher than one,\n\nthe precise determination of this limit requires a model considering the condition\n\nN >> ?.\n\nIt is worth to recall that, for moderately lean mixtures the nondimensional supera-\n\ndiabatic flame temperature increases when ? is decreased, whereas for the ultra-lean\n\nmixtures the superadiabatic flame temperature decreases when ? is decreased. Then,\n\nwe expect to find a point of maximum nondimensional superadiabatic flame temper-\n\nature in the lean side of the equivalence ratio range. This can be understood by\n\nconsidering two limiting cases. For N ? 0 the two equations for the conservation\n\n\n\n97\n\nof energy are decoupled and the flame structure has the same structure of a free-\n\nflame. The solid-phase plays no role in the solution and superadiabatic temperatures\n\nare not possible. For N ? ? the two phases are in local thermal equilibrium and\n\nthe problem reduces to a one-equation model, i.e., a free-flame like structure for a\n\nhomogeneous medium with effective properties and again superadiabatic flame tem-\n\nperatures are not possible. For intermediate values of N thermal non-equilibrium\n\nbetween the phases and superadiabatic flame temperatures are found and a point of\n\nmaximum nondimensional superadiabatic flame temperature must exist.\n\nAn interesting characteristic of the model is that Eqs. (4.24) and (4.27) do not\n\ndepend on ?, i.e., in a first approximation the solid thermal conductivity ?s does\n\nnot influence the gas- and solid-phases temperatures at the flame. This is due to\n\nthe fact that the heat conduction is not the limiting process responsible for the gas-\n\nphase preheating (?\n(?)(0)\nsf = 1). Then, the interphase heat transfer and the convective-\n\ndiffusive balance in the gas phase are the controlling process that define the properties\n\nat the flame. Nevertheless, the solid-phase conductivity impacts the extension of the\n\ntotal flame thickness, lS. For ultra lean mixtures, the solid-phase diffusion length-scale\n\nis very large. For example, the total length of the flame (pre-heating and reaction\n\nregions) reaches 20 cm for ? = 0.225. This occurs because the low flame velocities of\n\nthese extremely lean mixtures allow a wide thermal penetration.\n\nAccording to Eq. (4.13), the solid-phase temperature at the flame is found by\n\n?\n(?)\nsf = 1 ? ?\n\n?1?\n(?)(1)\nsf . According to Eq. (4.23), ?\n\n(?)(1)\nsf varies with N\n\n?1/2\n0 , and since N0\n\nincreases as ? decreases, the solid-phase temperature at the flame ?\n(?)\nsf is expected to\n\nincrease for lower values of ?. This is a consequence of the intense interphase heat\n\ntransfer found in extremely lean mixtures. As N0 increases, the solid- and gas-phase\n\n\n\n98\n\ntemperatures at the flame becomes closer, approaching the adiabatic limit.\n\n4.4.2 Influence of the matrix properties\n\nFigure 4.5 shows the dependence of N0, ?\n(?)\ngf , ?\n\n(?)\nsf and sF on ?. The effect of decreasing\n\n?, for a constant ?, is to decrease the mean pore diameter dm, thus resulting in a large\n\nheat transfer coefficient hv and, consequently, in a large value of N0. Again, the effect\n\nof increasing N0 is to decrease the superadiabatic effect. According to Eq. (4.24),\n\nthe gas-phase temperature at the flame varies as ?1/2. The flame velocity follows the\n\ngas-phase temperature at the flame and increases with increasing values of ?. As N0\n\nincreases the solid-phase temperature at the flame approaches the limiting value of\n\nunity.\n\nWhen the linear density of pores ? is increased while maintaining a constant\n\nporosity ? the mean pore diameter decreases. This leads to a solid matrix with a large\n\nspecific superficial area (m2/m3) increasing the interphase heat transfer coefficient hv\n\nand the parameter N0. The behavior of the flame variables when increasing ? is sown\n\nin Fig.4.6 and is similar to that of decreasing the porosity, i.e., for higher values of\n\nN0 the superadiabatic effect decreases.\n\nIt is interesting to note that decreasing ? the condition of N0 ? O(1) is obtained\n\nfor decreasing values of ?, i.e., the decrease in hv caused by the larger pores has\n\nto be balanced by the lower flame velocities obtained for leaner mixtures. This, in\n\nturn, leads to decreasing values for the lean flammability limit as shown in Fig.4.7.\n\nThis result shows that, for premixed combustion within porous inert media, the lean\n\nflammability limit is no longer a property of the reactants mixtures only, but it is\n\nalso dependent on the solid matrix properties. Additionally, at the lean flammability\n\n\n\n99\n\nFigure 4.5: Dependence of N0, ?\n(?)\ngf , ?\n\n(?)\nsf and sF on ?.\n\nlimit, the reaction length-scale lR is of the order of the pore diameter ld, showing\n\nthat, in this limit, the interphase heat transfer tends to be important even at the\n\ninnermost length-scale.\n\n4.4.3 Influence of the Lewis number\n\nFigure 4.8 shows the effect of fuel Lewis number LeF on the flame variables. Since,\n\naccording to Eq. (3.58), lower flame velocities sF are found for lower values of LeF ,\n\nthe interphase heat transfer is intensified due to the longer contact time between the\n\nphases and, consequently, the superadiabatic effect decreases.\n\n\n\n100\n\nFigure 4.6: Dependence of N0, ?\n(?)\ngf , ?\n\n(?)\nsf and sF on ?.\n\n4.4.4 Flame structure\n\nFigure 4.9 shows the flame structure for ? = 0.225, ? = 60, ? = 0.8, ? = 50\n\nppi and LeF = 1. The profile of the solid temperature at the gas scale presents a\n\ndisplacement in relation to the solution at the solid scale. This happens because in\n\nthe solution of the problem at the gas-phase diffusion length-scale only the continuity\n\nof the energy flux through the solid-phase is required as a matching condition. There\n\nis no matching condition that requires the continuity of the temperature. Then,\n\nthe results are consistent even with this gap in the solid solution. This kind of gap\n\nbetween the inner and outer solutions is present in other asymptotic solutions [99].\n\n\n\n101\n\nFigure 4.7: The flame velocity sF as function of ? for different values of ?. The\nnumbers in parenthesis are the corresponding mean pore diameters.\n\nThe present solution shows that, even though we are dealing with a problem that\n\npresents local thermal equilibrium in a wide region around the flame, the choice to\n\nmodel the problem with the one-equation model for the conservation of energy would\n\nneglect the existence of superadiabatic flame temperatures in a thin region around\n\nthe flame. These superadiabatic flame temperatures decrease as the interphase heat\n\ntransfer is increased, however, there should exist a small region of thermal nonequi-\n\nlibrium around the flame where superadiabatic flame temperatures will be found, in\n\norder for the flame to be sustained. This result cannot be obtained with the models\n\nthat assume local thermal equilibrium between the phases over the entire domain of\n\nsolution.\n\n\n\n102\n\nFigure 4.8: Dependence of N0, ?\n(?)\ngf , ?\n\n(?)\nsf and sF on LeF .\n\n4.5 Conclusions\n\nAn analysis of adiabatic stationary planar premixed flames within inert porous media\n\nis proposed for the conditions of N ? O(?) and ?/(1 ? ?) ? O(1). The condition\n\nN ? O(?) is characterized by an intense interphase heat transfer and is found for\n\nextremely lean mixtures. These flames present a wide region of local thermal equi-\n\nlibrium between the phases and the superadiabatic effect is limited by the intense\n\ninterphase heat transfer at the gas-phase diffusion length-scale.\n\nThe superadiabatic effect is less pronounced for lower values of ? and higher values\n\nof ?. This behavior is related to the increase in the interphase heat transfer coefficient\n\n\n\n103\n\nFigure 4.9: Flame structure for ? = 0.225, ? = 60, ? = 0.8, ? = 50 ppi and LeF = 1.\n\nhv. The superadiabatic effect is also less pronounced for lower values of LeF , a\n\nbehavior which is connected to the lower flame velocities observed for decreasing\n\nvalues of LeF .\n\nThe analysis shows that the superadiabatic flame temperature decreases as ? is\n\ndecreased, i.e., as the interphase heat transfer becomes more intense. Since in a\n\nprevious model, valid for higher equivalence ratios, the superadiabatic flame tem-\n\nperature increases when ? is decreased, a maximum nondimensional superadiabatic\n\nflame temperature in the lean side of the equivalence ratio range is expected to exist.\n\nFor extremely lean mixtures the gas-phase temperature at the flame must reach a\n\nminimum superadiabatic flame temperature for the flame propagation to be possible.\n\n\n\n104\n\nThus, the model shows the existence of a flammability limit for ultra-lean mixtures.\n\nFor methane-air flames, considering LeF = 1, and with ? = 60, ? = 0.8 and ? = 50\n\nppi, the present analysis predicts the lean flammability limit to occur around ? =\n\n0.217 with a gas-phase temperature at the flame 20% above the adiabatic limit. A\n\nbetter determination of this limit would require the use of, at least, a four-steps kinetic\n\nmechanism and the solution of the problem of N0 >> 1. These results cannot be\n\nobtained with the models that assume local thermal equilibrium between the phases\n\nover the entire domain of solution because these models do not allow superadiabatic\n\nflame temperatures to arise.\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nA Level-set model for the\nnumerical simulation of porous\nburners\n\nIn this chapter, the level-set method for flame simulations is presented and then\n\nemployed in conjunction with the flame speed expression obtained in the previous\n\nchapters to build a model for three-dimensional numerical simulations. A 1D version\n\nof the model is employed to solve two test problems and the model limitations are\n\ndiscussed.\n\n6.1 Introduction\n\nThe level-set method is an interesting tool for the predicting the main thermal as-\n\npects of the combustion in porous media and could be used as basis for building an\n\nefficient, low computational cost, design tool for porous burners with complex three-\n\ndimensional shapes. The model can be based on the G-equation for the flame move-\n\nment in combination with the analytical expression for the flame velocity obtained\n\nin the previous chapters. The main idea is to use a macroscopic volume-averaged\n\n119\n\n\n\n120\n\nmodel to describe the problem of heat transfer between the gas and solid phases at\n\nthe large scale lS (macroscale model) and a premixed flame model for the local flame\n\nconsumption speed (microscale model) as a form of multiscale treatment for reaction\n\nin porous media [58].\n\nVan Oijen and de Goey [56] developed a flamelet-generated-manifold method\n\n(FGM) where a higher dimensional flame is considered as an ensemble of one-dimensional\n\nflames. This model is divided in three parts: the first part describes the fluid motion\n\nand mixing process, the second part describes the front motion through a kinematic\n\nG-equation (level-set) and the third part consists of a set of 1D flamelet equations,\n\nusing a local coordinate adapted to the flame sheet, governing the inner flame struc-\n\nture and local mass burning rate. The flamelet equations are solved by treating the\n\nsystem as an 1D adiabatic premixed flame. These solutions form a manifold that can\n\nbe used in subsequent simulations. To test this method, they simulated a ceramic-\n\nfoam surface burner in a radiating furnace and compared the results with temperature\n\nmeasurements at the gas-phase above the burner [57]. The small differences between\n\ncomputed and measured temperatures were found to lie within the experimental er-\n\nrors. It is worth mentioning that, in this application, the flame is stabilized above\n\nthe burner surface.\n\nNevertheless, their method is not directly applicable to volumetric burners, i.e.,\n\nporous burners in which the flame is stabilized within the solid matrix. In this case,\n\nthe 1D set of flamelet equations must include the solid-phase energy equation and the\n\nreaction region cannot be considered as an adiabatic region. As seen in the previous\n\nchapters, the downstream gas-phase heat conduction [related to the parameter m in\n\nEq. (3.58)] has a central role in determining the flame velocity and is a direct result\n\n\n\n121\n\nof the interaction between the gas-phase and the solid matrix. Additionally, since\n\nthe solid-phase length-scale, lS, is large, the flame is influenced by the heat losses far\n\nupstream or far downstream from the flame, which brings new difficulties in building\n\na FGM version for volumetric burners.\n\nIn the next section, the level-set method applied to premixed combustion problems\n\nis reviewed. Then, a simplified model for three-dimensional simulations of porous\n\nburners is proposed and a microscale model for the premixed flame velocity in porous\n\ninert media is formulated based on the results of the previous chapters. Finally,\n\nresults of the present level-set model are presented and compared to a conventional\n\nmodel, i.e., one that solves the full set of volume-averaged conservation equations,\n\nincluding global chemical kinetics, for the entire domain. The model limitations are\n\nevaluated and the multidimensional implementation is discussed.\n\n6.2 Level-set method\n\nThe level-set method is based on a transport equation for a non-reacting scalar, G,\n\nthat describes the propagation of the flame front. The flame thickness is assumed\n\nto be small and the problem is reduced to a thin reactive sheet separating unburnt\n\nand burnt gases. The flame is located at G = G0 and the flame front displacement\n\ndepends on the local balance between the flow velocity and the flame propagation\n\nvelocity (consumption speed). The dynamics of this reactive sheet is described by\n\nthe G-equation [60].\n\nConsider a scalar field of a non-reacting scalar G. An isoplane of G is defined\n\nas the surface where G(t, x) = constant. The kinematic equation that describes the\n\n\n\n122\n\nFigure 6.1: Velocity balance at the flame surface.\n\nmotion of such an iso-surface is given by\n\nDG\n\nDt\n?\n?G\n\n?t\n+ vf \u00b7?G = 0, (6.1)\n\nwhere vf is the iso-surface absolute velocity vector, with respect to the laboratory\n\nframe. The left hand side of Eq. (6.1) is the material derivative of the scalar field G.\n\nA point on a given iso-surface will remain at this surface for all t. The normal vector\n\non an iso-surface is defined as\n\nn? =\n?G\n|?G|\n\n, (6.2)\n\npointing to the burnt side of the flame.\n\nFigure 6.1 shows a schematic representation of the velocity vectors of interest.\n\nThe isoplane velocity vf is the result of a balance between the local flow field velocity\n\nu and the local flame displacement velocity vF , with respect to the flow velocity, as\n\nvf = u ?vF n?. (6.3)\n\n\n\n123\n\nNote that the tangential component of the flow velocity and of the isoplane velocity\n\nare equal (ut = vf,t). Then, the amount of mass effectively consumed by the flame is\n\n?(u ? vf ) \u00b7 n?.\n\nNow, substituting Eqs.(6.2) and (6.3) into (6.1) we find the G-equation\n\n?G\n\n?t\n+ u \u00b7?G = vF | ?G | . (6.4)\n\nThis scalar equation describes the surface displacement as the result of a balance\n\nbetween the flow advection and the front propagation.\n\nThe G-equation has meaning at the flame front only, where the propagation veloc-\n\nity vF is defined. Outside this surface, the form of the G-function can be arbitrarily\n\ndefined and the results are not to be affected by this choice. Then, a convenient\n\ndefinition for the G-function is\n\n|?G| = 1, (6.5)\n\nthus G is a signed distance function in relation to the flame surface, i.e., the value of\n\nG at each point in the solution domain is equal to the distance from this point to the\n\nclosest point along the flame surface. Then, the flame front is the zeroth level of the\n\nG-function. Note that the solution of the G-field is independent of the form of the\n\nG-function outside G = G0 because there are no diffusion terms in Eq. (6.4).\n\nA problem that arises in the solution of Eq. (6.4) is that the G-function may be-\n\ncome distorted and large or small gradients around the flame surface may be created.\n\nTo overcome this difficulty it is usual to periodically replace the resulting G-field with\n\n|?G| = 1, maintaining the same zero level set. This is usually called reinitialization\n\nstep. Some authors proposed ways of accurately performing this task [101, 102].\n\nAnother problem in solving Eq. (6.4) is the formation of cusps when the flame\n\nvelocity is assumed to be constant. Level-set models with flame velocity expressions\n\n\n\n124\n\nthat account for the effects of flame curvature and flame strain are presented in the\n\nliterature [54, 103]\n\nThe coupling between the G-equation and the energy equation is a key-point in\n\nthe level-set modeling. Three approaches have been proposed in the literature: 1)\n\na flame-front tracking, which through geometric considerations identifies the front\n\ndisplacement and calculates the volume of reagents consumed by the flame [104, 105],\n\n2) a temperature reconstruction technique, where the temperature field is directly\n\nreconstructed from the G-field, independent of any energy balance equation [54, 106],\n\nand 3) an estimate of the heat release based on the G-field to determine the source\n\nterm to be included in the energy equation [106].\n\nIn the next section, a simplified model to multidimensional simulations of pre-\n\nmixed flames in porous inert media based on the level-set method is presented.\n\n6.3 Mathematical formulation\n\n6.3.1 Macroscopic-level model\n\nWith the use of the G-equation for the flame movement and a proper model for\n\nthe flame velocity (microscopic-level model), a simplified model for the simulation of\n\npremixed flames in porous media can be constructed. The flame velocity model is\n\nobtained from the results of the preceding chapters and will be summarized in the\n\nnext section.\n\nIn the macroscopic-level problem, the reaction region is assumed to be a thin\n\nsurface separating fresh and burned gases. Then, the species conservation equations\n\ndo not need to be solved and the heat release term in the gas-phase energy equation\n\n\n\n125\n\nis substituted by a local source term to be modeled. A steady-state two-medium\n\nmodel is now written for the conservation of total mass, momentum, gas-phase and\n\nsolid-phase energy as\n\n?\n??gu\n\n?t\n+ ??\u00b7?gu = 0, (6.6)\n\n?g\n?\n\n(\n?u\n\n?t\n+ u \u00b7?u\n\n)\n= ??p + ?gf\n\n+\n\u00b5\n\n?\n?2u ?\n\n\u00b5\n\nK\nu ?\n\nCE\nK1/2\n\n?g|u|u, (6.7)\n\n?

(6.8), the term s?r is the heat source due to the homogeneous reactions.\n\nIt can be modeled as a concentrated heat source at the flame surface or can be\n\ndistributed around the flame based on the G-field. A one-dimensional example of a\n\ndistribution implementation is presented in the Section 6.3.4. The flame movement\n\nis modeled by the G-equation presented in the previous section, Eq. (6.4).\n\n6.3.2 Microscopic-level model\n\nIn the previous chapters, asymptotic solutions where proposed for stationary adia-\n\nbatic premixed flames in porous inert media taking advantage of the large difference\n\nbetween the thermal conductivity of the solid and gas phases. For completeness,\n\nthe main length-scales identified in the previous analysis are presented below and\n\n\n\n126\n\nFigure 6.2: Schematic representation of the temperatures and fuel mass fraction dis-\ntributions for the different characteristic length-scales of the problem.\n\nsketched in figure 6.2,\n\nlG\nlS\n\n=\n?\n\n(1 ??)?\nand\n\nlR\nlG\n? ?,\n\nwith lG ? ??g/(??nsF cp).\n\nThe extent of the thermally affected region, lS, is determined by a balance among\n\nthe conduction trough the solid-phase, the interphase heat transfer and the advection\n\ntransport in the gas-phase. As shown in Chapter 4, this region tends to the local\n\nthermal equilibrium when the mixture is extremely lean, in which case the gas-phase\n\nthermal diffusion is also important. The reactions are restricted to a region lR that\n\nis a fraction of the gas-phase length-scale, lG.\n\nA first-order estimate for the flame speed for premixed flames in porous inert\n\nmedia was derived in Chapter 3, Eq. (3.58). In Chapter 4 it is shown that the same\n\n\n\n127\n\nexpression for the flame velocity is valid even for extremely lean mixtures.\n\nThe model in Chapter 3 was not valid for ? ? 1 due to the reaction expression\n\ndependance on the oxidant mass fraction. Here it is used a fuel decomposition model\n\nof the form\n\nwr = A?YFT\na\ng e\n?Ea/RuTg. (6.10)\n\nThen, the new flame speed expression obtained is\n\ns2F =\n2A ?f ?g T\n\na\ngf LeF ?\n\n2 exp(??/?)\n(?2n cp)\n\nexp\n\n{\n? ?rec\n\n1 + ? ?rec\n+ mn\n\n}\n. (6.11)\n\nThe nondimensional reaction region thickness, ?, the heat recirculation efficiency,\n\n?rec, and the term mn are given by\n\n? =\n[1 + ? ?rec]\n\n2\n\n?\n, (6.12)\n\n?rec ?\n??nsFcp(Tgf ?Tr)\n\n??nsFYF,nQ\n=\n\n(Tgf ?Tr)\n(Tr ?Tn)\n\n, (6.13)\n\nmn = 1.344m? 4m2(1 ?m)/(1 ? 2m) + 3m3\n\n?ln(1 ? 4m2), for ? 0.2 &lt;m &lt;0.5, (6.14)\n\nAs shown in Chapter 3, Eq. (6.14) is an approximation to the numerical solution\n\nof the 1D energy and species conservation equations at the reaction region for a\n\npremixed free-flame obtained by Lin?a?n [87], n is a displacement on the coordinate\n\naxis imposed to match asymptotically the solution in the reaction length-scale to\n\nthat in the gas-phase diffusion length-scale and m is the ratio of the thermal energy\n\nconducted downstream from the flame (normal to the flame surface) to the total\n\nenergy release.\n\n\n\n128\n\nFor adiabatic combustion, approximate expressions for m are available in the\n\nprevious chapters. An estimate for intermediate to stoichiometric values of the equiv-\n\nalence ratio can be obtained from Eq. (5.15) as\n\nm =\n?rec\n2\n\nNe\n?e\n\n[\n(1 + 4/Ne)\n\n1/2 ? 1\n]\n, (6.15)\n\nwhere ?e is the effective thermal conductivities ratio [?e = (1 ??) ?s/??g] and Ne is\n\nthe effective heat transfer parameter (NTU based on lS and sF ) given by\n\nNe =\n(1 ??) ?shv\n(??nsFcp)\n\n2\n. (6.16)\n\nFor ultra-lean mixtures, an approximation for m is given by Eq. (4.31). This expres-\n\nsion can be written as a function of ?rec as\n\nm = 1 ??rec/2, (6.17)\n\nNote that ?rec is related to the macroscopic solution via Tgf .\n\nAn alternative choice is to calculate m directly from the macroscopic field of Tg\n\nas\n\nm =\n(???g?Tg)f+\n\n? m???gcp (Tr ?Tn)\n, (6.18)\n\nwhere the term (???g?Tg)f+ is the downstream gas-phase conduction heat flux nor-\n\nmal to the flame surface and m???g is the local mass flux of reactants per unit area. The\n\nadvantage of this option is that Eq. (6.18) is valid even for non-adiabatic conditions.\n\nAs was noted in Chapter 3, in combustion within porous-media, the value of m is\n\nbounded by 0 ? m ? 0.5, with the limit m = 0 corresponding to a freely propagating\n\nflame and the limit m = 0.5 corresponding to flame extinction. Then, the parameter\n\nm can be used as an indication of how close a flame is from extinction. Note also that\n\nthe flame velocity expression given by Eq. (6.11) is dependent on the flame surface\n\n\n\n129\n\nthrough the flame temperature Tgf , then, curvature effects are already incorporated\n\nin the model, in a first approximation.\n\nThe separation of the length-scales of the problem, lR ? lS, permits the use of Eqs.\n\n(6.11) to (6.18) as a subgrid model to compute the flame velocity of premixed flames\n\nwithin porous inert media. The subgrid model relates the flame speed (microscale\n\nmodel) to the flame temperature that is a result of the energy balance between the\n\nphases (macroscale model).\n\n6.3.3 Model validation\n\nTo validate the proposed model, a one-dimensional steady-state problem is analyzed.\n\nThe level-set model proposed here and the conventional model are presented below.\n\nLevel-set model.\n\nThe steady-state 1D version of the macroscopic Eqs. (6.6) to (6.9) is written as\n\n??u = ??nsF , (6.19)\n\n??nsFcp\ndTg\ndx\n\n= ??g\nd2Tg\ndx2\n\n+ s?r + hv(Ts ?Tg), (6.20)\n\n0 = (1 ??)?s\nd2Ts\ndx2\n?hv(Ts ?Tg), (6.21)\n\nwhere ? and cp are gas-phase properties.\n\nThe heat source is modeled as\n\ns?r =\n\n{\n??nunYF,nQ/lR, for x = xf,\n\n0, for x 6= xf,\n(6.22)\n\n\n\n130\n\nwhere ?nun is the mass flow of the reactants, YF,n is the initial mass fraction of the\n\nfuel and Q is the heat of reaction based on the mass of fuel. Equation (6.22) indicates\n\nthat the energy is released at the flame sheet, x = xf , only. In fact, it is distributed in\n\na length-scale that is thinner than the mesh size, as will be shown in the next section.\n\nThe 1D version of Eq.(6.4) is\n\n?G\n\n?t\n+ u\n\n?G\n\n?x\n= vF\n\n?????G?x\n???? , (6.23)\n\nwith u being the x component of the velocity vector u. Since Eq.(6.23) is valid at\n\nthe flame position only, the flow velocity and the flame velocity are defined at that\n\nlocation as vF = sF (?n/?f ) and u = un(?n/?f ). Additionally, with the |?G| = 1\n\ncondition, Eq. (6.23) reduces to\n\n?G\n\n?t\n= (sF ?un)\n\n?n\n?f\n. (6.24)\n\nNote that the temporal derivative of the level-set equation is maintained in this\n\nformulation since the G-Equation will be used to move the flame from its initial\n\nposition to its final stabilized position in a transient (distorted) calculation. Then, at\n\nsteady state, Eq. (6.10) is reduced to sF = un.\n\nNo formal derivation of the volume-averaged level-set equation is presented here.\n\nThen, the G-Equation is viewed heuristically as\n\n??G?g\n\n?t\n= (?s?gF ??u?\n\ng\nn)\n???gn\n???gf\n\n. (6.25)\n\nConventional model.\n\nThe results of the level-set approach are compared to a model, here named conven-\n\ntional, based on the simultaneous solution of total mass, species and thermal energy\n\nequations with a one-step kinetic mechanism,\n\n??u = ??nsF , (6.26)\n\n\n\n131\n\n??nsF\ndYF\ndx\n\n= ??DF\nd2YF\ndx2\n\n??A?YFTag e\n?Ea/RuTg, (6.27)\n\n??nsFcp\ndTg\ndx\n\n= ??g\nd2Tg\ndx2\n\n+ ?QA?YFT\na\ng e\n?Ea/RuTg + hv (Ts ?Tg) , (6.28)\n\n0 = (1 ??)?s\nd2Ts\ndx2\n?hv(Ts ?Tg), (6.29)\n\nTwo test problems will be considered with different boundary conditions:\n\nTest problem 1: Adiabatic combustion in an infinite medium.\n\nIn this case, the boundary conditions for the fuel mass fraction and for the gas-\n\nand solid-phase temperatures are Dirichlet conditions at the inlet (Tg = Ts = Tn\n\nand YF = YF,n) and Neumann conditions at the outlet (?/?x = 0). The G-equation\n\nis not necessary since the flame position is imposed. The problem is aimed at the\n\nevaluation of the effect of a concentrated heat source on the flame velocity prediction.\n\nNote that for the conventional model, the flame velocity (eigenvalue) is obtained from\n\nthe integration of the fuel mass conservation equation.\n\nTest problem 2: Flame stabilization in a porous radiant burner.\n\nIn the second case, the porous medium is finite (L = 10 mm) and radiant heat\n\nlosses are allowed at both ends. Then, the boundary conditions at the inlet (x = 0)\n\nare\n\n?(1 ??)?s\ndTs\ndx\n\n????\nx=0\n\n= ??SB?(T 4s,0 ?T\n4\n?), (6.30)\n\n???g\ndTg\ndx\n\n????\nx=0\n\n= ???nuncp(Tg,0 ?T?), (6.31)\n\n\n\n132\n\nand the boundary conditions at the outlet (x = L) are\n\n?(1 ??)?s\ndTs\ndx\n\n????\nx=L\n\n= ?SB?(T\n4\ns,L ?T\n\n4\n?), (6.32)\n\n???g\ndTg\ndx\n\n????\nx=L\n\n= 0. (6.33)\n\nwhere ?SB is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, ? is the solid-phase total hemispherical\n\nemissivity, Ts,0 and Ts,L are respectively the solid-phase temperature at the inlet and\n\noutlet, Tg,0 is the inlet gas-phase temperature and T? is the ambient temperature.\n\nIn this problem, the inlet velocity is imposed and the flame is allowed to find its\n\nstabilization position.\n\nWhen solving the fuel conservation equation in the conventional model, the bound-\n\nary conditions are Dirichlet conditions at the inlet and Neumann conditions at the\n\noutlet.\n\n6.3.4 Numerical method\n\nThe conservation equations are discretized in a standard finite volume form as dis-\n\ncussed by Patankar [94]. The power-law scheme is used for the approximation of the\n\ntotal flux (convection and diffusion). A uniform mesh is used for the calculations,\n\nexcept for the conventional model in the test problem 1, where a refined grid at the\n\nflame is employed. Steps are taken to accelerate convergence to steady-state.\n\nIn the present implementation, a distribution scheme of the heat release based on\n\ngeometrical considerations is used. The heat source is distributed in the characteristic\n\nreaction length-scale (lR = ? lG) that is thinner than the computational mesh size.\n\nThen, the heat release is effectively modeled as a concentrated source. Nevertheless,\n\n\n\n133\n\nFigure 6.3: Source term distribution in the computational mesh.\n\nthis distribution allows a smooth transition of the flame front between two adjacent\n\ncells. Figure 6.3 shows a schematic representation of the computational grid, with the\n\nshadowed area representing the region where the heat release is to be distributed. This\n\nis done comparing the value of G in the cell interfaces with the reaction length-scale\n\nlR\n\ns?r,i =\n\n???????\n??????\n\n0, for Ge &lt;?lR or Gw > 0,\ns?r (lR + Gw + ?x) , for Gw &lt;?lR &lt;Ge,\ns?r (?Gw) , for Gw &lt;0 &lt;Ge,\ns?r, for Gw &lt;?lR and Ge > 0.\n\n(6.34)\n\nwhere, s?r,i is the heat release term of the i\nth cell, s?r = ??nunYF,nQ/lR is the total heat\n\nrelease (s?r =\n?\ns?r,i), Gw and Ge are the values of the G-field at the left and right cell\n\ninterfaces respectively (G(x) = x?xf ) and ?x is the mesh size.\n\nThe flame velocity, sF , is calculated based on Eqs. (6.11) to (6.14), but the heat\n\n\n\n134\n\nrecirculation efficiency expression, Eq. (6.13), is modified to\n\n?rec = C\n(Tgf ?Tr)\n(Tr ?Tn)\n\n, (6.35)\n\nwhere C is an adjustable parameter. This parameter is introduced here to correct\n\na small discrepancy between the flame velocity predicted by the conventional model\n\nand the one predicted by the level-set model. The parameter m is evaluated directly\n\nfrom the Tg field as\n\nm =\n???g (dTg/dx)f+\n??nuncp (Tr ?Tn)\n\n. (6.36)\n\nFor the test problem 2, the solution algorithm can be summarized as:\n\n1. The flame is initiated at an arbitrary position xf with hyperbolic tangents for\n\ninitial (guessed) gas- and solid-phase temperatures,\n\n2. The G-field is imposed to be a signed distance function in relation to the flame\n\nfront in a direct form, i.e., G(x) = x?xf\n\n3. The heat source is distributed as described by Eq. (6.34),\n\n4. The conservation equations, Eqs. (6.19) to (6.21), are solved for a limited\n\nnumber of iterations (10 iterations are sufficient),\n\n5. The flame velocity, Eq. (6.11), is calculated based on the flame temperature\n\nTg,f obtained from the solution of the conservation equations, with m given by\n\nEq. (6.36) and ?rec given by Eq. (6.35),\n\n6. A time step is advanced and the level-set equation, Eq. (6.25), is solved resulting\n\nin a new G distribution.\n\n7. The flame position is identified as xf = x (G = 0),\n\n\n\n135\n\n8. Return to step 2.\n\nThis process is repeated until the G-equation solution results in a stationary flame,\n\ni.e., when sF = un. The solution was considered converged when the relative errors\n\nfor the global energy balance across the burner were smaller than 1 \u00d7 10?6.\n\nThe reaction rate parameters for the one-step model considered were adjusted to\n\ngive a reasonable agreement with measured laminar flame speeds for methane-air free\n\nflames [93] for equivalence ratios ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 (relative errors smaller than\n\n8%). The heat of reaction was adjusted to reproduce the adiabatic flame temperature,\n\nwhich is approximated by a polynomial function [107]. A constant volumetric heat\n\ntransfer coefficient hv is estimated following Fu et al. [21]. The gas-phase properties\n\nwere approximated by the air properties evaluated at 1300 K. Transport and geometric\n\nproperties of the solid-phase are typical of porous burners [2, 26]. Table 6.1 shows\n\nthe parameters and properties used in the calculations. For the numerical solution of\n\nthe conventional model, the flame speed (eigenvalue) was obtained from the overall\n\nmass balance.\n\n6.4 Discussion\n\nIn the following, the premixed flame within an adiabatic infinite medium is computed,\n\nthen, the model is employed to study the flame stabilization in a finite medium with\n\nradiant heat losses at both ends.\n\n\n\n136\n\nTable 6.1: Properties and parameters used in the calculations.\n\nParameter Value Unit\nA 1.0 \u00d7 108 s?1\na 0\ncp 1187 J(kg K)\n\n?1\n\nEa 1.41 \u00d7 109 J mol?1\nhv 2.0 \u00d7 105 W(m3 K)?1\nLeF 1\nRu 8.314 J(mol K)\n\n?1\n\nT? 298.15 K\n? 0.8\n?g 0.0797 W(m K)\n\n?1\n\n?s 4.783 W(m K)\n?1\n\n?n 1.185 kg m\n?3\n\n6.4.1 Adiabatic combustion in an infinite medium\n\nIn this section, the present model is compared to the conventional solution for an\n\ninfinite adiabatic medium. Figure 6.4 shows the flame speeds predicted by the two\n\nmodels for equivalence ratios ranging from 0.5 to 1. The level-set model presents a\n\ngood agrement with the conventional model. The relative error of the flame velocity\n\npredicted by the present model to that calculated by the conventional one ranges\n\nfrom 0.5% for ? = 1 to 4% for ? = 0.5.\n\nFigure 6.5 shows the comparison of the gas and solid-phase reduced temperatures\n\nfor the two models for ? = 1. The level-set model is able to reproduce both phases\n\ntemperature distributions with discrepancies smaller than 3%.\n\nThe errors in the temperature distributions are found to increase as ? decreases.\n\nFigure 6.6 shows the temperature profiles for ? = 0.5 for both models. Indeed, the\n\nerror in the flame temperature prediction is around 5%, decreasing to less than 3% far\n\n\n\n137\n\nFigure 6.4: Comparison of the predicted flame velocity for the conventional model\nand the level-set model with concentrated heat release.\n\nfrom the flame. These increasing discrepancies are due to the fact that the level-set\n\nmodel concentrates the heat release in a thin region around the flame position. In\n\nthe conventional solution, the heat release is spread over a wider region (of the order\n\nof lG). Since, for leaner mixtures, lG becomes increasingly wider, the assumption of\n\na concentrated heat release becomes less valid.\n\nThe parameter C in Eq. (6.35) can be adjusted to match the level-set results for\n\nthe flame velocities with that obtained with the conventional model. This adjustment\n\nvaries from 1 to 5% as can be seen in Fig. 6.7. This small adjustment could be\n\nimportant in determining the flame position in a finite length burner, in particular\n\n\n\n138\n\nFigure 6.5: Comparison of the gas- and solid-phase temperatures between a conven-\ntional model and the level-set model for ? = 1.\n\nfor flames near the blow-off limit, as will be shown in the next section.\n\n6.4.2 Flame stabilization in a porous radiant burner\n\nStability results\n\nIn this section the level-set model is used to evaluate the flame stabilization in a\n\nporous radiant burner of finite length with radiant heat losses at the inlet and outlet\n\nends. In this case, there is a range of flow rates in which the flame stabilization is\n\n\n\n139\n\nFigure 6.6: Comparison of the gas- and solid-phase temperatures between a conven-\ntional model and the level-set model for ? = 0.5.\n\npossible [13]. In the numerical solution, the flame position is not imposed, instead, it is\n\nthe outcome from the balance between the flow convection and the flame propagation.\n\nStable solutions are found for flames located near the inlet surface of the burner, a\n\ncondition in which an increase of the flow velocity results in an increase of the flame\n\ntemperature [48].\n\nFigure 6.8 shows the gas-phase temperature predicted by both models as a function\n\nof the inlet flow velocity, un, for ? = 1. The flame stabilization range was determined\n\nby varying un with 0.1 m/s increments until the blow-off or flash-back limits were\n\n\n\n140\n\nFigure 6.7: Adjustment of the parameter C in Eq. (6.35).\n\nfound. The level-set model presents a good agreement with the conventional one. For\n\nboth models the stabilization is not possible for un > 0.86 m/s. On the other hand,\n\nthe level-set model predicts stable flames for inlet flow velocities as low as 0.43 m/s,\n\nwhereas in the conventional model this limit is found for 0.51 m/s.\n\nFigure 6.9 shows the flame temperature (maximum gas-phase temperature) and\n\ninlet velocity, which is equal to the flame velocity, sF = un, as a function of the flame\n\nposition. The blow-off limit is found in the region where flame temperature is nearly\n\nconstant with increasing inlet velocities, or, in other words, when the derivative of the\n\nflame temperature with respect to the flame position tends to zero (??g,f/?xf ? 0).\n\n\n\n141\n\nFigure 6.8: Gas-phase temperature distribution as a function of the inlet flow velocity\nun for ? = 1\n\nAs shown in [48], a further increase in un, beyond the blow-off limit, may lead to a new\n\nflame position (near the outlet surface of the burner) where the equilibrium between\n\ninlet and flame velocities is found again, however, this position is unstable and will\n\nnot be considered here. Note that, near the blow-off limit, small differences in the\n\nflame velocity prediction may result in completely distinct stabilization conditions,\n\nsince a small increase in un may lead to large flame displacements. This explains\n\nthe discrepancies observed between the models near the blow-off limit. Then, as a\n\ngeneral rule, the flame has a tendency to find its stable position near the inlet surface\n\n\n\n142\n\nof the burner. The relative errors between both models for the flame temperature\n\nprediction are smaller than 2%. The errors between both models for the flame position\n\nprediction, relative to the total length of the burner, are also smaller than 2%.\n\nFigure 6.9: Inlet velocity un and flame temperature ?g,f as a function of the flame\nposition xf .\n\nThe flash-back limit is characterized by the situation where a decrease in the inlet\n\nvelocity leads the flame to propagate upstream from the burner inlet surface. The\n\ndiscrepancies between the models near this limit are due to the differences in the\n\nresponse of the flame temperature (and velocity) to the upstream heat losses. As\n\nis shown in Fig. 6.9, the conventional model results are less sensitive to the flame\n\n\n\n143\n\nposition and, consequently, to the inlet heat losses near the inlet end of the burner.\n\nThen, the flame velocity does not decrease sufficiently to stabilize smaller flow rates\n\nand the flash back limit is found.\n\nFigures 6.10 and shows the gas and solid-phase temperatures for un equal to 0.51\n\nand 0.86 m/s. The differences in the solid-phase temperature predictions are similar\n\nto those in the gas-phase. These differences are smaller near the outlet surface of\n\nthe burner, what is important since the solid-phase temperature distribution in this\n\nregion defines the forward radiant output of the burner. This is shown in figure 6.11,\n\nwhich brings the forward and backward radiant losses of the burner, as defined by\n\nthe boundary conditions, Eqs. (6.30) and (6.32). The discrepancies between the two\n\nmodels for the prediction of the forward radiant output of the burner are smaller than\n\n0.5% (unless near the flashback limit where the errors increase to 3%).\n\nFigures 6.12 and 6.13 show the stability range for ? = 0.8 and ? = 0.6 respec-\n\ntively. It is known from experimental works that the stability range decreases as the\n\nequivalence ratio is decreased [1, 13] and this tendency is captured by the numerical\n\nsolution. The agreement between both models becomes less precise for lower equiv-\n\nalence ratios, although the errors for the flame position prediction are still smaller\n\nthan 2%. However, for example, for ? = 0.6, the level-set model overestimates the\n\nflame temperature and the relative errors between both models reaches 6%. This\n\noccurs because, for lower values of ?, the reaction region thickness increases and the\n\nconcentrated heat release condition, imposed in the level-set model, becomes a poor\n\napproximation. Additionally, the increase of the reaction region thickness for lower\n\nvalues of ?, renders the conventional model more sensitive to the inlet heat losses\n\nand, thus, the flash back limit is found for lower inlet flow rates.\n\n\n\n144\n\nFigure 6.10: Gas and solid-phase temperatures for un = 0.51 and 0.86 m/s.\n\nCPU time evaluation\n\nThe advantages of the present model can be observed in the figures 6.14 to 6.16. In\n\nthe conventional model, Fig. 6.14, 400 points in the mesh are required to achieve mesh\n\nindependence (the mesh points evaluated were 50, 100, 200, 400 and 800 points). The\n\ncriterion used to determine mesh independence was to achieve relative errors smaller\n\nthan 0.1% for the flame temperature and flame position predictions. For a 100-points\n\nmesh no solution can be obtained. The level-set model with a concentrated heat\n\nrelease is much less sensitive to the mesh size and Fig. 6.15 shows that good solutions\n\n\n\n145\n\nFigure 6.11: Forward (qrad,L) and backward (qrad,0) radiant losses as a function of the\ninlet velocity for ? = 1.\n\ncan be obtained even with a 100-points mesh.\n\nFinally Fig. 6.16 shows the CPU time required to obtain a converged solution in\n\na standard 2.0 GHz processor / 1.0 Gb RAM PC for both models. The computa-\n\ntions were initiated with hyperbolic tangents for the guessed temperature and species\n\ndistributions with the flame placed at 1 mm from the inlet surface. For number of\n\npoints in the mesh larger than 250, the level-set model is faster than the conventional\n\none. With an 800-points mesh, for example, the level-set model is approximately\n\n40% faster. For a 200-points mesh, the conventional model is faster than the level-set\n\n\n\n146\n\nFigure 6.12: Gas-phase temperature distributions as a function of the inlet flow ve-\nlocity un for ? = 1.\n\nmodel, however, the solution obtained is poor due to the low resolution of the mesh\n\nas seen in Fig. 6.14, i.e., the solution is no more mesh independent. For the present\n\nproblem, to assure mesh independence, the comparison must be made between the\n\nlevel-set model with 100-points mesh and the conventional model with 400-points\n\nmesh. The result of this comparison is that the level-set model is about 16 times\n\nfaster than the conventional model. For some points near the blow-off limit, the\n\nlevel-set model requires a 200-points mesh to achieve mesh independence. In these\n\ncritical cases, the level-set model is about 6 times faster than the conventional one,\n\n\n\n147\n\nFigure 6.13: Gas-phase temperature distributions as a function of the inlet flow ve-\nlocity un for ? = 0.6.\n\nwhich also meets with difficulties in finding the converged solution.\n\nIn summary, the present problem shows that the level-set model is able to predict\n\nreasonably well the flame position and temperature distributions as a function of the\n\ninlet flow velocity for moderately lean mixtures (? ? 0.6) with reduced computational\n\neffort. The difficulties in extending the present model to multidimensional problems\n\nare discussed in the next section.\n\n\n\n148\n\nFigure 6.14: Dependence of the gas-phase temperature on the numerical mesh for the\nconventional model.\n\n6.4.3 Discussion on multi-dimensional implementation\n\nThe level-set model can be employed to study two- and three-dimensional problems.\n\nThe expected advantage is the requirement of less computational effort than that with\n\nconventional models. This advantage comes from the fact that the level-set model\n\ndoes not solve the inner structure of the flame and that coarser grids can be used.\n\nHowever, in multidimensional problems two important aspects of the present\n\nmodel need to be adapted. The first one is the reinitialization scheme. In the 1D\n\nproblem solved here, the direct reinitialization scheme used was easy to implement\n\n\n\n149\n\nFigure 6.15: Dependence of the gas-phase temperature on the numerical mesh for the\nlevel-set model.\n\nand had a marginal impact in the CPU time. In the proposed scheme, the flame\n\nposition (G = G0) is precisely identified (via front tracking) and the G-field is im-\n\nposed to be a signed distance function based on the position of the mesh points in\n\nrelation to the flame position [G(x) = x ? xf ]. This approach is computationally\n\ndemanding for 2D and 3D simulations. A more efficient scheme that could be used is\n\nbased on the solution at each time step of a transient reinitialization equation for the\n\nG-field that has the properties of maintaining its zeroth-level while converging it to\n\na signed distance function at steady-state [101]. A method for solving this equation\n\nthat guarantees the conservation of the flame surface is proposed in the literature\n\n\n\n150\n\nFigure 6.16: CPU time vs mesh points.\n\n[102]. Additionally, since the G-equation is valid only at flame surface, the reinitial-\n\nization procedure could be restricted to a narrow region around G = G0 (narrow band\n\napproach).\n\nThe second aspect to be addressed in multidimensional simulations is the distribu-\n\ntion of the heat release. The scheme proposed here relies on geometric considerations\n\nbased in the comparison of the G-field and the reaction length-scale, lR, thus determin-\n\ning the heat source at each mesh cell. Again, this scheme is simple to be employed in\n\nthe 1D problem, but can be computationally demanding in multidimensional simula-\n\ntions. Nevertheless, this approach is currently being used by some authors [104, 108].\n\n\n\n151\n\nAnother option is to develop some kind of temperature or heat release reconstruction\n\nas proposed in [106].\n\nAn important characteristic of the present level-set model is that the flame speed is\n\nintrinsically dependent on the flame front temperature through ?rec. The advantage\n\nof this dependence is that the effect of flame curvature in the large scale, lS, is\n\nalready accounted for by the numerical solution of the gas- and solid-phase energy\n\nequations. Note that the curvature effect for the combustion in porous media is much\n\nmore pronounced than in free-flames, since the solid-phase conductivity enlarges the\n\nthermal affected region. Then, as a first approximation, no modification to Eq. (6.4)\n\nis needed to avoid formation of cusps. On the other hand, this approach requires\n\nthe identification of the flame temperature and, consequently, the flame position (via\n\nfront tracking) at each time step, what may reduce the computational advantages.\n\n6.5 Conclusions\n\nA level-set model is developed for the simulation of complex three-dimensional flow\n\nand reaction in porous media. This model is based on a subgrid model that relates\n\nthe flame speed (microscale model) to the flame temperature that results from the\n\nenergy balance between the phases (macroscale model). The species conservation\n\nequation is not solved and the heat release is distributed around the flame position\n\nin the gas-phase. The flame movement is accounted for by a transport equation of a\n\nnon-reacting scalar G that describes the propagation of the flame front.\n\nA 1D version of the model is implemented to validate the method and is compared\n\nto a conventional model based on the solution of the full set of conservation equations.\n\nTwo situations were studied, the flame propagation in an adiabatic infinite medium\n\n\n\n152\n\nand the flame stabilization in a finite medium with radiant heat losses at the ends.\n\nThe results of the level-set model were in accordance with a conventional model for\n\nboth cases. Flame velocities, gas and solid-phase temperature profiles and flame\n\nposition were reasonably well predicted with the present approach.\n\nThe advantage of the proposed method is the lower CPU times required to achieve\n\nconvergence. For the problems studied, the level-set model is 6 to 16 times faster\n\nthan the conventional model, when ? ? 0.6. In the present implementation, the\n\nheat release is distributed in a length-scale that is smaller than the mesh size. Then,\n\nbetter results are obtained for higher equivalence ratios since, in these flames, the\n\nconcentration of the heat release in a thin region is a valid approximation.\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this chapter, the conclusions obtained in the previous chapters are summarized\n\nand future works are proposed.\n\n7.1 Summary of conclusions\n\nThis thesis is divided in two major parts. The first part is devoted to analytical\n\nanalysis of the structure of lean stationary adiabatic premixed flames within porous\n\ninert media, covering a wide range of equivalence ratios (Chapters 3 to 5). The second\n\npart is devoted to the construction of a level-set model for multidimensional numerical\n\nsimulations of porous radiant burners (Chapter 6).\n\nIn the model for N ? O(1) (Chapter 3) the principal characteristic length-scales\n\nof the problem were identified and used to construct an approximate solution for\n\nmoderately lean mixtures (0.6 ? ? ? 0.8). The two innermost length scales, the\n\ngas-phase length scale lG and the reaction length scale lR, are the same scales defined\n\nin the classical premixed flame structure analysis. The outermost length scale lS, the\n\nsolid-phase length scale, is related to the heat conduction in the porous matrix. In\n\n153\n\n\n\n154\n\nthis model, the interphase heat transfer at the gas-phase length-scale lG is neglected\n\n(this is the reason why this model is not valid for extremely lean mixtures). Then, the\n\ninfluence of the porous medium on the flame is to increase its temperature and velocity\n\nand this influence is more pronounced for leaner mixtures, higher solid-phase thermal\n\nconductivities (higher ?), lower porosities and lower fuel Lewis numbers. Also, under\n\nthe hypotheses considered, a number that defines the effects of all these parameters,\n\ncharacterizing the flame variables and universalizing the results, is identified. For this\n\nreason, this number is called the porous-media-flame number. The upper bound for\n\n? is a result of the simplifications made in the one-step kinetic mechanism used. This\n\nrestriction is removed in the flame velocity expression used in Chapter 6.\n\nIn the model for N ? O(?) (Chapter 4), the flame structure is characterized\n\nby an intense interphase heat transfer, a condition found for ultra-lean mixtures.\n\nThese flames present a wide region of local thermal equilibrium between the phases\n\nand the superadiabatic effect is limited by the interphase heat transfer at the gas-\n\nphase length-scale lG. Contrary to the previous model, the superadiabatic flame\n\ntemperature decreases as ? is decreased, i.e., as the interphase heat transfer becomes\n\nmore intense, which implies the existence of a point of maximum nondimensional\n\nsuperadiabatic flame temperature in the lean side of the equivalence ratio spectrum.\n\nThe model also shows (qualitatively) that, for extremely lean mixtures, the gas-phase\n\ntemperature at the flame must reach a minimum superadiabatic flame temperature\n\nfor the flame propagation to be possible, i.e., there is a lean flammability limit for the\n\npremixed combustion within porous inert media. A more accurate determination of\n\nthis limit would require the use of, at least, a four-steps kinetic mechanism and the\n\nsolution of the problem of N >> ?.\n\n\n\n155\n\nAn alternative formulation, based on the excess enthalpy function, proposed in\n\nChapter 5 was able to extend the validity of the first model (N ? O(1)) for inter-\n\nmediate lean mixtures, where the condition ? > N ? 1 is found. This model shows\n\n(qualitatively) the maximum nondimensional superadiabatic temperature discussed\n\nin Chapter 4 and also predicts (qualitatively) the lean flammability limit.\n\nFinally, a level-set model is developed for the simulation of complex three-dimensional\n\nflow and reaction in porous media (Chapter 6). This model is based on a subgrid\n\nmodel that relates the flame speed (microscale model) to the flame temperature that\n\nresults from the energy balance between the phases (macroscale model). The flame\n\nmovement is accounted for by the level-set method that describes the displacement\n\nof a thin interface due to the flow convection and self-propagation. The microscale\n\nmodel is built based on the results of the previous chapters. A 1D version of the model\n\nwas implemented to illustrate the method and showed reasonable accordance with a\n\nconventional model based on the solution of the full set of conservation equations.\n\nThe advantage of the proposed method is the lower CPU times required to achieve\n\nconvergence. For the problems studied, the level-set model was 6 to 16 times faster\n\nthan the conventional model.\n\n7.2 Suggestions for future works\n\nSome important extensions of the models presented in this thesis can be suggested\n\nfor future works:\n\n\u2022 To refine the model for N ? O(1) with the use of a 4-step kinetic mechanism, re-\n\nlaxing the assumption of a thin reaction region, to obtain more physical insights\n\n\n\n156\n\nabout the solid matrix effect on the inner flame structure.\n\n\u2022 To develop the model for N ? ? with 4-step kinetic mechanism to study flame\n\nextinction phenomena.\n\n\u2022 To include an approximate form of surface reaction dependent on pore size\n\n(through porosity and specific surface area) and assess the effect of surface\n\nreactions on flame extinction and propagation.\n\n\u2022 To study the burning of liquid fuels in porous media, including in the the solid-\n\nphase length analysis a model for the droplet evaporation.\n\n\u2022 To built a 2D version of the level-set model, including the solution of the radiant\n\ntransfer equation (RTE) and temperature dependent properties, to compare\n\nwith steady-state and transient experiments.\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\n[1] F.
