Na verdade, s\u00f3 consegui \nfinalizar este projecto porque pude contar com a ajuda, o \ncompanheirismo e a boa-vontade de muita gente, alguns dos quais \npassarei a nomear a seguir. Come\u00e7ando pelo in\u00edcio da hist\u00f3ria, tenho de \nagradecer em primeiro lugar \u00e0 pessoa que me deu esta oportunidade, o \nProfessor Amadeu Soares, que se viria a tornar meu orientador, \nacompanhando e amparando-me durante estes loucos 4 anos. Gostaria \nigualmente de agradecer ao meu co-orientador, o Professor Guarino Colli \nque, depois de tantas dificuldades foi um dos poucos que permaneceu ao \nmeu lado neste projecto.  \n\nOs dois anos que passei no Brasil foram recheados de descobertas \nentusiasmantes e momentos inesquec\u00edveis, mas tamb\u00e9m de in\u00fameras \nfrustra\u00e7\u00f5es. Em cada momento, dos melhores aos piores, tive a b\u00ean\u00e7\u00e3o \nde nunca me encontrar s\u00f3, apesar dos 5000km que me separavam da \nfam\u00edlia e dos amigos. Isto porque no Brasil encontrei uma outra fam\u00edlia, \nformada por pessoas que sempre me acarinharam e ampararam para \nque conseguisse terminar o meu trabalho de campo. Devo um \nagradecimento francamente especial ao Rafael Batista de Mendon\u00e7a, e a \ntoda a sua fam\u00edlia, que prontamente me acolheram como sua, tornando \ntudo suport\u00e1vel. Sem o vosso apoio n\u00e3o teria com certeza resistido a \ntanto, e este projecto seguramente n\u00e3o se teria concretizado. Um \n\u201cobrigado\u201d nunca traduzir\u00e1 o sentimento de gratid\u00e3o que tenho para com \nvoc\u00eas. Devo um agradecimento particularmente ternurento ao Sr. Em\u00eddio, \nque rapidamente se tornou um pai para mim e que, desde ent\u00e3o, nunca \ndeixou de estar presente nos meus pensamentos. Um obrigada cheio de \nsaudade tamb\u00e9m para o pessoal da Ecol\u00f3gica, ao Divaldo Rezende e \u00e0 \nsua m\u00e3e, \u00e0 Marly e, em especial ao Yuri, o meu menino!

O arroz \u00e9 a cultura alimentar mais importante do mundo. Dada a \nsua natureza, localiza\u00e7\u00e3o e extens\u00e3o a n\u00edvel global, os campos de arroz \nirrigado s\u00e3o invariavelmente utilizado pela fauna nativas. Determinar \ncomo as comunidades que vivem nesses agroecossistemas s\u00e3o \nafectadas \u00e9, portanto, de extrema import\u00e2ncia. O Cerrado, a maior e mais \ndiversa savana do planeta, encontra-se sob extrema press\u00e3o \nantropog\u00e9nica, com 50% do bioma atualmente sob uso humano direto. \nOs anf\u00edbios est\u00e3o entre os vertebrados mais amea\u00e7ados do planeta, \ndesempenhando pap\u00e9is de destaque no funcionamento dos \necossistemas. Como o seu ciclo de vida \u00e9 particularmente complexo, \ninvestigar a forma como as popula\u00e7\u00f5es de anf\u00edbios s\u00e3o afectadas por \natividades antropog\u00e9nicas requer uma abordagem integrada e \nmultidimensional, a v\u00e1rias escalas. ? Com este projecto pretendeu-se \navaliar a forma como a comunidade de anuros do Cerrado est\u00e1 a ser \nafetada pela press\u00e3o agr\u00edcola, avaliando o risco de extin\u00e7\u00e3o, analisando \nos traits selecionados, e a varia\u00e7\u00e3o na diversidade taxon\u00f3mica, \nfilogen\u00e9tica e funcional em diferentes escalas, bem como a conectividade \nfuncional dos anuros em culturas de arroz. Determinou-se que o risco de \nextin\u00e7\u00e3o de risco oficial dos anf\u00edbios do Cerrado se encontra \nsubestimado. O local de reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o, habitat e tamanho da postura s\u00e3o \npreditores de elevado risco de extin\u00e7\u00e3o em anuros. O sudoeste e regi\u00e3o \ncentral do bioma s\u00e3o as principais regi\u00f5es de esp\u00e9cies de alto risco de \nextin\u00e7\u00e3o, e devem ser priorizados para a conserva\u00e7\u00e3o. Concluiu-se \ntamb\u00e9m que a convers\u00e3o do habitat e a gest\u00e3o agr\u00edcola causaram \nprofundas altera\u00e7\u00f5es na comunidade de anuros, com o aumento da \ndiverg\u00eancia funcional e dram\u00e1tica perda de diversidade funcional e \nfilogen\u00e9tica em ambientes agr\u00edcolas. Anuros com distribui\u00e7\u00e3o restrita, \nespecializa\u00e7\u00e3o de habitat, posturas pequenas e grande tamanho corporal \nforam exclu\u00eddos dos ambientes agr\u00edcolas. Adicionalmente, anuros \nprovenientes de culturas apresentaram menor condi\u00e7\u00e3o corporal. Assim, \na convers\u00e3o de vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o natural em planta\u00e7\u00f5es de arroz irrigado resulta \nna extin\u00e7\u00e3o local de muitas esp\u00e9cies, independentemente da sua \nespecializa\u00e7\u00e3o, e no decr\u00e9scimo dos \u00edndices de condi\u00e7\u00e3o corporal nas \nesp\u00e9cies mais resistentes. ?A presen\u00e7a de abundantes fragmentos \nflorestais e de corpos de \u00e1gua \u00e9 determinante para a manuten\u00e7\u00e3o de \nn\u00edveis elevados de diversidade funcional e filogen\u00e9tica, e ainda para \nassegurar a conectividade funcional para as popula\u00e7\u00f5es de anuros em \npaisagens agr\u00edcolas.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nkeywords \n \n \n \n \nabstract \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAmphibians, agriculture, functional diversity, phylogenetic diversity, traits.  \n \n\n \n\nAnthropogenic activities such as agriculture and cattle farming are the \nmain causes of biodiversity loss. Agricultural expansion is especially \ndetrimental in the tropics, where agricultural investment meets important \nsocial and economic demands, and biodiversity is especially high and \nunique. Rice is the world\u2019s most important food crop. Given its nature, \nlocation and extension worldwide, irrigated rice fields are invariably used \nby the native fauna. Determining how communities living in these \nagroecosystems are shaped is therefore of the utmost concern. The \nCerrado, the world\u2019s largest and most diverse savanna is experiencing \nextreme anthropogenic pressure, with 50% of the biome currently under \ndirect human use. ?Amphibians are among the world\u2019s most threatened \nvertebrates, playing keystone roles in ecosystem functioning. Given the \ninherent complexity of their life cycle, approaching how amphibian \npopulations are affected by anthropogenic activities requires an \nintegrated, multidimensional approach, at multiple scales. This project \nsought to assess how the anuran community of the Cerrado is being \naffected by agricultural pressure, assessing the extinction risk, analyzing \nthe selected traits, and variation in taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional \ndiversity at different scales, as well as the functional connectivity of frogs \nin rice crops. The official extinction risk is underestimated for the anurans \nof the Cerrado. Breeding site, habitat specialization, and clutch size are \npredictors of increased extinction risk. The southwest and central regions \nof the biome are the main hotspots of increased extinction risk, and \nshould be prioritized for conservation. Habitat conversion and crop \nmanagement caused profound changes to the anuran community, \ncausing increased functional divergence and dramatic loss of functional \nand phylogenetic diversity in agricultural environments. Anurans with \nrestricted range, habitat specialization, small clutches and large body size \nwere excluded from agricultural environments. Additionally, frogs from \nagricultural environments had lower body condition. Thus, the conversion \nof natural vegetation to rice crops results in such environmental stress, \nthat large subsets of species are driven to local extinction irrespective of \ntheir specialization, and even the more resilient species exhibit lower \nbody condition. The presence of abundant forest fragments and water \nbodies is crucial for the maintenance of high levels of functional and \nphylogenetic diversity, and also to ensure functional connectivity for \nanuran populations in agricultural landscapes.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                             \n \n                                                                                                                              i \n \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS ? \n\n1.

INTRODUCTION \n1.1. Worldwide biodiversity crisis \n Biodiversity is currently facing a worldwide decline under increasing anthropogenic \npressure (Barnosky et al., 2011). According to Ceballos et al., (2015) the average rate of \n\nvertebrate species loss over the last century is up to 100 times higher than the background rate, \n\nrevealing an impending sixth mass extinction.  \n\n Biodiversity loss, caused by disturbances such as species overexploitation, habitat loss, \n\nclimate change, or invasive species (Brook et al., 2008; Dunn et al., 2009), compromises the \n\nsustainability of ecological processes and the provision of ecosystem services (Cardinale et al., \n\n2012).  \n\n Agriculture represents the largest landuse, occupiyng ca. 38 % of the world\u2019s terrestrial \n\nsurface (Foley et al., 2011). The impacts agriculture has on biodiversity are varied and \n\ncomplex, occurring at both habitat and landscape level (Weyland et al., 2012)  \n\n Global pressure to further increase food production in coming decades will be \n\nenormous, as the world population is projected to approach 11 billion by the end of this \n\ncentury, with the population of Africa nearly quadrupling (United Nations, 2013). In fact, the \n\nglobal extent of cropland is currently expanding faster than at any time in the past 50 years \n\n(Grassini et al., 2008). Future expansion of agriculture will be especially detrimental for \n\ntropical ecosystems (Dobrovolski et al., 2011; Laurance et al., 2014). The greatest agricultural \n\nexpansion will occur in South America and Sub-Saharan Africa (Bruinsma, 2009; World \n\nBank, 2009), which have large areas with unexplored agricultural potential. These include \n\nrainforests, such as the Amazon and Congo Basins, as well as vast semi-arid biomes, such as \n\nthe Cerrado South America or the Miombo and Guinea savanna-woodlands of Africa. Beyond \n\nfeeding the growing populace and eliminating hunger, rising incomes in many developing \n\nnations will result in increased demand for meat and dairy products, bioenergy production and \n\nbio-feedstocks for industry (Fargione et al., 2012; Scharlemann and Laurance, 2008). These \n\nneeds will inevitably be met by expanding agricultural systems stressed by climate change \n\n(Nelson et al., 2009).  \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n\t\n\n16\t\n\nTropical ecosystems sustain much of the Earth\u2019s biological diversity (Myers et al., \n\n2000), provide countless natural products and services to human communities (Grimes et al., \n\n1994) and play key roles in the global carbon and hydrological cycles (Avissar and Werth, \n\n2005; Fearnside, 2000). Unfortunately, many tropical ecosystems are being disrupted by large-\n\nscale land-use change and other environmental alterations (Laurance et al., 2014), facilitated \n\nby by improved crop and soil management practices that support higher yields. Furthermore, \n\nroad construction and improving medical technologies are allowing humans to colonize areas \n\nonce plagued by diseases (Hotez et al., 2009). \n\n Expanding agriculture could be particularly detrimental for biodiversity hotspots, \n\nterrestrial biogeographic regions that sustain exceptional species richness and endemism and \n\nhave suffered severe loss of their original vegetation (Mittermeier et al., 2004; Myers et al., \n\n2000). Tropical and subtropical ecosystems predominate in over half of the hotspots \n\n(Mittermeier et al., 2004). In addition to their many known species, hotspots are believed to \n\ncontain most of the Earth\u2019s undescribed species, many predicted to be restricted endemics \n\n(Joppa et al., 2011; Scheffers et al., 2012) and unlikely to survive in disturbed environments \n\n(Giam et al., 2012). Unfortunatelly, hotspots have highly dense and rapidly growing human \n\npopulations (Cincotta et al., 2000), often struck by extreme poverty (Fisher and Christopher, \n\n2007) and with low development scores (Jha and Bawa, 2006). Hotspot countries with the \n\nhighest population growth rates and lowest human development had the greatest deforestation \n\nrates (Jha and Bawa, 2006). Demands to increase food production, promote economic growth, \n\nand exploit natural resources could inflict high environmental costs on hotspot nations.  \n\n Many tropical landscapes are nowadays composed of crops, plantations, and \n\nsecondary, logged, and fragmented forests. Relative to intact forest, biodiversity is reduced in \n\nall modified tropical forests (Gibson et al., 2011), although to the smallest degree in \n\nselectively logged forests (Edwards et al., 2011; Putz et al., 2012). Biodiversity can be \n\nmoderate in some mixed-cropping and agroforestry systems (Perfecto and Vandermeer, 2010), \n\nbut is typically much reduced in plantation monocultures (Barlow et al., 2007; Fitzherbert et \n\nal., 2008; Ziegler et al., 2009). Mosaics of disturbed and secondary habitats can provide \n\nimportant habitat and foraging sites for forest species, as well as stepping stones and corridors \n\nfor biotic dispersal and animal migration (Barlow et al., 2007; Chazdon et al., 2009; Pereira \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n\t\n\n17\t\n\nand Daily, 2006; Perfecto and Vandermeer, 2010). Such mosaics can also be managed in some \n\ncases to benefit agriculture by promoting natural ecosystem services such as pest control and \n\npollination (Boreux et al., 2013). The natural values of intensively managed farmlands and \n\npastures are typically much lower than those of structurally more complex environments, such \n\nas logged and secondary forests, mixed plantings, and well-managed agroforestry systems \n\n(Edwards et al., 2011; Perfecto and Vandermeer, 2010). \n\n Given the massive anthropogenic pressure on tropical biomes, protected areas are the \n\ncore of conservation efforts in these regions. Approximately 6.6% of all tropical and \n\nsubtropical forests are now in strictly protected areas (Jenkins and Joppa, 2009). However, \n\nprotection of drier tropical habitats, including grasslands, savannas, and shrublands, is lower, \n\nwith 5.9% in strictly protected areas and 12.5% in all reserve categories (Jenkins and Joppa, \n\n2009). Although the network of tropical protected-areas has dramatically improved in the last \n\n25 years, it is still inadequate because many threatened and locally endemic species fall \n\nentirely outside of protected areas (Rodrigues et al., 2004). In addition, many reserves are \n\nimperiled by illegal encroachment, logging, hunting (Curran et al., 2004; DeFries et al., 2005; \n\nHarrison, 2011; Laurance et al., 2012). Reserves are thus becoming geographicly isolated and, \n\nas their surrounding habitats become increasingly modified, reserves and their biodiversity \n\nwill become increasingly imperiled. \n\nUnderstanding the factors behind biodiversity loss is among the main issues in \n\necology, and absolutely pivotal for decelerating the current species extinction rate. However, \n\nthe complexity and importance of this issue has not been met by the metrics used, e.g. species \n\nrichness. An important component of biodiversity loss that succedes or even precedes species \n\nextinctions is the elimination of ecological interactions in which those species are engaged \n\n(Aizen et al., 2012; Tylianakis et al., 2008). As many key functional aspects of ecosystems \n\ndepend on biotic interactions, their loss may have pervasive effects, accelerating species local \n\nextinction, impairing ecosystem functions, and ultimately collapsing the derived services \n\nprovided to humans (D\u00edaz et al., 2013).  \n\nThe collapse of biological interactions and their associated ecological functions may \n\nfrequently precede the complete disappearance of species, i.e., when a species\u2019 abundance is \n\nso reduced as to represent its functional extinction (S\u00e4terberg et al., 2013; Wilkie et al., 2011). \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n\t\n\n18\t\n\nBiotic interactions are thus a major but often neglected component of biodiversity that needs \n\nto be considered in order to assess the \u2018health\u2019 of ecosystems and define critical indicators \n\nproviding early diagnosis of environmental problems (Aizen et al., 2012; Dirzo et al., 2014; \n\nTylianakis et al., 2008). \n\n However pessimistic most predictions may appear, recent estimates of extinction risk \n\nfrom a wide range of ecosystems indicate that real empirical data often exceed predicted \n\nextinctions (Maclean and Wilson, 2011). Hence, we are still far from having adequate tools to \n\npredict species loss attributable to major anthropogenic disturbances such as habitat loss (He \n\nand Hubbell, 2011). In a research field still dominated by species richness as the diversity \n\nmetric (Cardinale et al., 2012), adequate assessment of biodiversity loss and consequent \n\neffects on ecosystem functions and services may be impaired, ultimately compromising the \n\neffectiveness of every resultant management and conservation plan. Thus, there is an urgent \n\nneed to quantify and predict the effects of disturbance on biodiversity patterns to guide \n\nconservation efforts and the management of ecological resources. \n\n \n\n1.2. The value of ecophysiological traits in ecology \nAnalyses of past and projected extinctions have revealed highly non-random patterns \n\nin extinction risk (Anderson et al., 2011; Murray et al., 2011b; Olden et al., 2007; Thuiller et \n\nal., 2011; Tingley et al., 2013). Thus, not all species are equally at risk of extinction. A \n\nspecies\u2019 vulnerability to extinction depends on extrinsic threats such as habitat loss or invasive \n\nspecies, and on its intrinsic ability to respond to such threats (Cardillo et al., 2005; Collen et \n\nal., 2011; Murray et al., 2014). A species\u2019 response to threats is largely mediated by its traits, \n\nspecific characteristics, related to physiological, morphological, and life-history features \n\ninherent to the organism and measurable at the individual level (Violle et al., 2007).  \n\nAccording to the habitat template theory of Southwood, (1977), the habitat provides \n\nthe template on which evolution shapes characteristic life-history strategies through natural \n\nselection. Consequently, major environmental drivers influence the fitness of the species in a \n\nconsistent manner, depending on the traits they possess, resulting in species sorting (McGill et \n\nal., 2006; Southwood, 1977; Webb et al., 2010). The interaction between traits and \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n\t\n\n19\t\n\nenvironmental conditions is known as environmental filtering (e.g., Webb et al., 2010) a \n\nconcept describing how traits are filtered in the regional species pool to yield the final trait \n\ncomposition, species composition and relative abundance in the community (Fig. 1.1). \n\nHowever, natural selection and species sorting do not operate at the level of single traits, but \n\non whole organisms carrying multiple traits. Consequently, species performance will be a \n\nfunction of combinations of traits that synergistically present an adaptive response to the \n\nenvironment (Verberk et al., 2013, 2008). \n\nGiven the determinant role traits have on community composition, the ability to predict \n\nwhich species are more prone to go extinct - a major goal of conservation biology - can be \n\nachieved through trait-based approaches. While classic taxon-based approaches compare \n\nspecies assemblages (e.g., taxonomic composition, species richness, abundance measures) and \n\nrelate them to differences in environmental conditions (Hawkins et al., 2010; Lancaster et al., \n\n2009), trait-based approaches focus on the species\u2019 attributes that determine its ability to deal \n\nwith environmental changes. Compared to taxon-based, trait-based approaches have i) \n\nimproved mechanistic understanding of species\u2013environment relationships (Kearney and \n\nPorter, 2009) and, consequently, ii) greater generality of such relationships because of \n\napplicability across regions.  \n\nThe use of species traits in ecology is rapidly expanding (Doledec and Statzner, 2010; \n\nMenezes et al., 2010; Vandewalle et al., 2010), showing great potential for transforming \n\ndescriptive field studies into a predictive science of community ecology. However, trait-based \n\napproaches are yet to deliver on this promise.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n\t\n\n20\t\n\n \n\n1.2.1. Predicting extinction risk \nThe IUCN Red List is arguably the most useful list of species extinction risk and has \n\nbeen used to raise awareness about threatened species, guide conservation efforts and funding \n\nand set priorities for protection (Baillie et al., 2008; Mace et al., 2008; Mart\u00edn-L\u00f3pez et al., \n\n2011; Rodrigues et al., 2006). The Red List classifies species into different risk categories \n\naccording to a set of quantitative criteria assumed to translate extinction risk, such as \n\npopulation range, population size, decline and/or spatial fragmentation (IUCN, 2001). Species \n\nFigure 1.1 Schematic representation of the taxon-based (A) and trait-based (B) approaches to \nunderstanding the differences in species assemblages resulting from abiotic and biotic \nconditions. Trait-based approaches are based on the notion that the habitat acts as a templet that \nmechanistically explains how major environmental drivers influence the fitness of the species, \ndepending on the combination of traits they possess.  \n\nENVIRONMENT \n\nSPECIES \n\nTraits filter \n \n\nSpecies Traits \n\nR\nes\n\npo\nns\n\ne \nof\n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n s\n\npe\nci\n\nes\n to\n\n c\non\n\ndi\ntio\n\nns\n \n\nENVIRONMENT \n\nSPECIES \n\nE\nffects of species on conditions \n\nSpecies \nfilter \n\nA B \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n\t\n\n21\t\n\nare classified as Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN) and Vulnerable (VU) or, if \n\nthreat criteria are not met, as Least Concern (LC). If available data are insuficient to determine \n\nconservation status, species are categorized as Data Deficient (DD). Hence, a species \n\ncategorized as threatened can have stable populations and be listed because of other factors \n\nassumed to raise the extinction risk, such as a limited number of subpopulations.  \n\nDespite the unquestionable value of this system for conservation, there is an increasing \n\nawareness that many extinctions go unnoticed because they occur within small, strongly \n\nneglected organisms (e.g., Cardoso et al., 2010; Dunn et al., 2009; R\u00e9gnier et al., 2009; \n\nTriantis et al., 2010). Worldwide conservation efforts have mostly relied on a few emblematic \n\ngroups, because monitoring populations of rare, inconspicuous or unpopular species living in \n\nunaccesible or largely unsampled areas is a challenging process and would hardly be funded. \n\nAlthough Red List criteria are meant to be applicable to the majority of described species, \n\nseveral logistic constraints and intrinsic human preferences have produced a deep bias \n\n(Dom\u00ednguez Lozano et al., 2007). While almost all of the mammalian and avian species have \n\nbeen evaluated, ca. 24% of amphibians remain DD and only 0.5% of the described arthropod \n\nspecies worldwide have been evaluated (IUCN, 2015). This portraits the Red List as heavily \n\nbiased towards large species with wide distribution ranges and high dispersal abilities (i.e., \n\nthose that are easily sampled), disregarding small species with narrow distribution ranges and \n\nlow dispersal abilities, which constitute the vast majority of the planet\u2019s biota, particularly \n\nlocal endemics. Hence, the most threatened species may be systematically excluded.  \n\nThe Red List criteria are difficult to apply using the information available for many \n\nspecies (Kozlowski, 2008) because of four main shortfalls (Cardoso et al., 2011): (1) many \n\nspecies are undescribed (the Linnean shortfall); (2) the distributions of described species are \n\nlargely unknown (the Wallacean shortfall); (3) species\u2019 abundances and their changes in space \n\nand time are unknown (the Prestonian shortfall); and (4) species\u2019 ecology and sensitivity to \n\nhabitat changes are largely unknown (the Hutchinsonian shortfall). These four shortfalls stem \n\nfrom the fact that basic taxonomy and natural history research is scarce and underfunded. Poor \n\nbasic knowledge impairs reliable extinction risk attribution. However, even if the required \n\ninformation could be gathered, the current criteria may not be appropriate for many species. \n\nThus, further frameworks should be used complementary to the Red List in order to \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n\t\n\n22\t\n\nthorouhgly assess extinction risk and guide conservation practice. \n\nSome life-history traits are related to colonization ability and extinction risk, which \n\nmeans that traits may be used as surrogates for extinction risk when population data are scarce \n\n(Fagan et al., 2001; Henle et al., 2004). Fagan et al., (2001) were able to predict the general \n\nextinction vulnerability of 60 out of 72 mammals simply by knowing body size, age at first \n\nreproduction, and average number of offspring. Worldwide, the extinction vulnerability of bat \n\nspecies was correlated with small geographic ranges and low wing aspect ratios (Jones et al., \n\n2003). Declining amphibian species in Central America had large body sizes, restricted \n\nelevational ranges and aquatic habitats (Lips et al., 2003). Other factors, including clutch size, \n\nbody size and ecological niche, have also been identified as potentially important (Hero et al., \n\n2005; Lips et al., 2003; Stuart et al., 2004; Williams and Hero, 1998). In fact, small \n\ngeographical range size has been consistently identified as the most important predisposing \n\nfactor to decline (Cooper et al., 2008; Gaston and Fuller, 2009; Murray and Hose, 2005). \n\nDespite particular traits predisposing species or groups of species to decline, external \n\nfactors must be considered (Cardillo et al., 2008; Davies et al., 2006). The effects of a threat \n\ncan be expected to vary spatially and across species because unique suites of traits respond \n\ndifferently to a disturbance (e.g. habitat specialists are particularly vulnerable to habitat \n\ndestruction (Norris and Harper, 2004)). This results in complex, context-dependent and/or \n\nindirect pathways to decline (Blaustein and Kiesecker, 2002; Davidson et al., 2009). Murray et \n\nal., (2011a) for example, show that the spatial distribution of chytridiomycosis is a better \n\ncorrelate of decline than range size in Australian frogs, while Bielby et al., (2008) showed that \n\nthe intrinsic traits of infected species correlate with whether they have suffered rapid declines \n\nor not as a result of infection. Given the diversity of known threats and the array of ecological \n\nand life-history traits that predispose species to decline, untangling the complex interactions \n\nthat result in specific pathways to decline or extinction is a challenging task (Bielby et al., \n\n2009, 2008; Blaustein and Kiesecker, 2002; Davidson et al., 2009) but one that is important \n\nfor predicting further declines and, more importantly, improving our ability to do something \n\nabout them (Wilson et al., 2007). For these reasons, it has been recently stressed that \n\nconsidering both intrinsic traits and extrinsic threats together is pivotal for thoroughly \n\nassessing extinction risk (Cardillo et al., 2008). \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n\t\n\n23\t\n\n \n\n1.2.2. Community response to disturbances \n Data on species composition only provides context and bioregion-specific information, \n\nand metrics such as richness or diversity do not translate ecological functions (Vandewalle et \n\nal. 2010). Furthermore, our limited knowledge of population dynamics, physiological \n\ntolerances, ecological constraints, or long-term and indirect effects can impair our ability to \n\ninvestigate ecological ramifications of biodiversity loss.  \n\n Ecophysiological and behavioral traits are consistent among populations of the same \n\nspecies, are easily access than demography data, and are associated with various \n\nenvironmental variables of interest (Cane et al., 2006; Devictor et al., 2008). For example, \n\ntraits such as body size, determine the spatial scale at which the organisms perceive their \n\nenvironment and control access to resources of various kinds (mineral nutrients, prey items, \n\nnest sites, pollinators, e.g.,(Larsen et al., 2005; Petchey and Gaston, 2006a)  affecting species \n\nturnover among habitats, along environmental gradients or between regions (Mason et al., \n\n2007). Hence, incorporating widely-available information about species traits and looking for \n\nconsistent responses within groups that share traits would allow predictions of general patterns \n\nthat could be applied to a range of related taxa and provide a mechanistic link between \n\ndisturbances and patterns of response within communities (Mouillot et al., 2013a; Williams et \n\nal., 2010).  \n\n This approach would also be fruitful for devising management plans when land \n\nmanagers and stakeholders face decisions associated with landscape or global changes and \n\nhow these might impact communities or particular species of conservation concern. \n\nFurthermore, if the traits that determine species response to environmental change or \n\ndisturbance are positively correlated to those that determine functional importance, then \n\nfunctional trait composition and overall ecosystem function may also change dramatically \n\n(Petchey and Gaston, 2006b). In fact, measures of the functional traits within a community \n\nhave been shown to be better predictors of ecosystem processes than species diversity metrics \n\n(Flynn et al., 2011; Naeem et al., 2012; Thompson et al., 2015). Quantifying and predicting \n\nfunctional community structure within a context of increasing disturbance is thus required to \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n\t\n\n24\t\n\nanticipate the potential loss of ecosystem services that is indisputably associated with \n\nbiodiversity erosion (Cardinale et al., 2012). \n\n Specifically, in anthropogenic habitats, assemblages may be filtered by species \n\ndispersal ability, with dispersal being one of the most important traits for assemblage recovery \n\nafter disturbance in both vertebrates and plants (Kyle and Leishman, 2009; Moretti and Legg, \n\n2009). However, disturbed ecosystems have also been found to select for smaller and more \n\nfecund species, while larger slow-growing species are better suited to stable habitats (Chiu and \n\nKuo, 2012; Statzner and B\u00eache, 2010). Disturbance and eventual recovery also affect \n\nvegetation structure, microclimate, environmental stressors such as aridity, and resource \n\nspectra such as soil fauna or plant seeds, with implications for other functional traits (Entling \n\net al., 2007; Schirmel and Buchholz, 2011). Therefore, trait responses to disturbance are \n\ncomplex and may be mediated by multiple environmental effects in addition to filters of \n\ndispersal ability. \n\n In recent years, trait analyses have been used for evaluating ecosystem health, \n\nespecially for certain organisms, such as macroinvertebrates, which have been viewed as a \n\npromising biomonitoring tool to assess human impacts on freshwater habitats (e.g. Doledec \n\nand Statzner, 2010; Culp et al., 2011). \n\n \n\n1.2.3. Ecosystem services and resilience \n The loss of biodiversity due to anthropogenic activity can have profound impacts on \n\nthe functional properties of ecosystems and the services they provide (Naeem et al., 2012). \n\nRecent emphasis on ecosystem services for attributing value to ecosystems and promote their \n\nsustainable use (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005) has drawn attention to the ways in \n\nwhich different organisms contribute to the delivery of ecosystem services (D\u00edaz et al., 2007; \n\nLuck et al., 2012; Suding et al., 2008). However, our ability to assess how ecosystem services \n\nare affected by anthropogenic activities is still incipient. \n\n  \n\nDisentangling how ecosystems provide multiple services consists first in allocating \n\nrelevant ecosystem properties to each service, and identifying which organisms, or groups of \n\norganisms, control these properties (Kremen, 2005). Afterwards, it is necessary to discern the \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n\t\n\n25\t\n\nkey characteristics and mechanisms by which these organisms affect ecosystem properties \n\n(Hooper et al., 2005; Luck et al., 2012). Species functional traits influence ecosystem \n\nfunctioning directly by mediating changes in biotic controls (e.g., predation or competition) \n\nand indirectly through responses to changes in local environment (e.g., microclimates or \n\ndisturbance regimes) (Chapin et al., 2000). This is being approached in an increasing number \n\nof studies, such as those identifying the functional roles of pollinators (Kremen et al., 2007), \n\nparticular plant groups as nitrogen fixers (Spehn et al., 2002), soil or sediment engineers \n\n(Boyero et al., 2007) and different faunal groups (Heemsbergen et al., 2004). Such studies \n\nhave identified functional traits as the key factors by which species (D\u00edaz et al., 2007; Hooper \n\net al., 2005; Luck et al., 2012) influence ecosystem properties, mostly structural plant traits \n\n(e.g. plant growth form, tissue chemistry, leaf morphology, canopy size and architecture), \n\nmicrobial ecophysiological traits and behavioural animal traits (feeding habit, substrate type, \n\nnesting activity, mobility, environmental and temporal niche). Hence, quantificatying the kind, \n\nrange, and relative abundance of functional traits in biotic communities can greatly contribute \n\nto ecosystem service assessment and management (D\u00edaz et al., 2007; Petchey and Gaston, \n\n2006b).  \n\n Functional trait diversity, rather than the diversity of species per se, is the dimension of \n\nbiodiversity most directly related to ecosystem functioning (Cadotte, 2013). Variation in \n\nfunctional trait diversity and composition due to land management can be a strong driver of \n\necosystem functioning and ecosystem services (Fig. 1.1).  \n\n Understanding the linkages between biodiversity and ecosystem services is especially \n\ncrucial for predicting how changes in environment and management practices will impact the \n\nmultiple ecosystem services provided by agroecosystems (Kremen and Miles, 2012; Power, \n\n2010). Wood et al., (2015) state that a trait-based approach to agriculture that is analogous to \n\nthat applied in broader ecology (e.g., Cadotte et al., 2011; de Bello et al., 2010; Violle et al., \n\n2007) could help better identify the mechanisms underlying the role of agrobiodiversity in \n\nproviding agroecosystem services. Biodiversity loss is known to affect not only ecosystem \n\nfunctioning but also crop yield (Daily, 1997). For example, landscape intensification may \n\ndisrupt processes such as biological pest control (Perfecto and Vandermeer, 2010; Symondson \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n\t\n\n26\t\n\net al., 2002), crop pollination (Kremen et al., 2007; Ricketts et al., 2004) and resistance to \n\nplant invasion (Levine et al., 2004; Zavaleta and Hulvey, 2004).  \n\n As species differ in their potential contribution to ecosystem services, increasing \n\nbiodiversity enhances the probability that a species that strongly enhances ecosystem \n\nfunctioning is present. Hence, the functional identity of one or few species dominating \n\necosystem processes becomes important. Sampling effects have been shown to be important in \n\nexperiments with sown grasslands where the random inclusion of particularly productive \n\nspecies contributed to overall productivity (in addition to complementarity effects, Loreau and \n\nHector, 2001). The chance of including a particularly effective species in a given environment \n\nappears to increase with the number of species in the available pool. Species redundancy \n\nmeans that a positive relation between diversity and functioning holds only for few species \n\nand additional species do not increase function, but plateau at higher diversity levels. \n\nHowever, redundancy is important because only high-diversity systems with redundancy in \n\nfunctional groups can be expected to provide the capacity for reorganization after disturbance. \n\nHigh diversity of functional groups may allow reorganizations after disturbances (Bengtsson \n\net al., 2005), due to a high number of insurance species (the insurance hypothesis of \n\nbiodiversity, Loreau et al., 2003). Surplus or redundant species may become even more \n\nimportant in an ever-changing environment, as formulated by the hypothesis of spatiotemporal \n\ninsurance by biodiversity. In unpredictable human-dominated landscapes, diverse \n\ncommunities support species that may become important as soon as others disappear. \n\nEconomically, this is an option value for the future. For example, Perfecto et al. (2004) found \n\nthat high tree richness in coffee agroforestry supports a diverse bird community that turned out \n\nto increase predation on lepidopterans. Hence, these diverse coffee landscapes appeared to \n\nprovide an important function with the prevention of potential pest outbreaks. The many \n\nsolitary bee species on highland coffee are more effective pollinators than the few, but \n\nabundant, social species, thereby contributing to the positive relation of fruit set to bee \n\ndiversity (Klein et al., 2003). This mechanism is similar to that of the collective role of rare \n\nplant species providing resistance to a grassland invader (Lyons and Schwartz, 2001). \n\nRemoval of many rare plant species, but not removal of the same biomass of common species, \n\nenhanced invasion success of Lolium multiflorum (see also Levine et al., 2004). In such cases \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n\t\n\n27\t\n\nmany rare species may turn out to be more important for ecosystem functioning than few \n\nabundant species. \n\n \n\n1.3. Functional &amp; Phylogenetic diversity \nPreventing dramatic and global loss of biodiversity, along with its consequences for \n\necosystem services is still possible through intensified and integrated conservation efforts. \n\nThorough and effective magament and conservation plans are therefore urgent and can only be \n\nachieved if reliable ways to monitor biodiversity and accurately assess how land use \n\nintensification might affect ecosystem services have been developed (Mace and Baillie, 2007).  \n\nClassical biodiversity measurements such as species richness have relied on three main \n\nassumptions: (i) all species are equal (only relative abundances establish the relative \n\nimportance of species), (ii) all individuals are equal (whatever their size) and (iii) species \n\nabundances have been correctly assessed with appropriate tools and in similar units \n\n(Magurran, 2004). However, species not only offer a wide range attributes, they are also likely \n\nto support many goods and services through ecosystem processes (e.g. D\u00edaz et al., 2007). \n\nHence, the first assumption of biodiversity measurement is not valid: some species carry more \n\nevolutionary history or functional traits essential to ecosystem processes than others (Cadotte \n\nand Davies, 2010; Mouillot et al., 2013b). This consensus has resulted in a growing focus on \n\nthe diversity and values of functional traits that influence ecosystem functioning, as a tool for \n\nexplaining the role of organisms in ecosystems and the ecological impacts of their loss \n\n(Petchey and Gaston, 2006b). Nonetheless, most studies addressing community assembly in \n\nhuman-modified landscapes rely on simplistic taxonomic metrics (Sodhi and Ehrlich, 2010) \n\nand leave important ecosystem-level  \n\n \n\nconsequences unaddressed. Because the complex effects of environmental variation induced \n\nby human activities on species is ultimately mediated by specific characteristics (e.g. \n\nphysiological constraints, habitat requirements, dispersal abilities), considering only \n\ntaxonomic metrics may fail to provide accurate conclusions on the real consequences of \n\nanthropization on biodiversity. To attain more representative conclusions on the effects human \n\nactivities have on communities, we must go beyond species number and account for different \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n\t\n\n28\t\n\ncomponents of biodiversity.  \n\nFunctional (FD) and phylogenetic diversity (PD) are estimates of biodiversity based on \n\necological functions and evolutionary histories of species, respectively. FD describes the \n\nvariability in ecological attributes among species and expresses ecosystem resistance, \n\nresilience and functioning (Petchey and Gaston, 2006a). Use of the term \u201cfunctional diversity\u201d \n\nhas grown exponentially over the last decades (Petchey and Gaston, 2006a) and the concept of \n\nfunctional diversity is gaining a place of general importance in ecological research (Naeem, \n\n2002). Measuring functional diversity is equivalent to measuring functional trait diversity, \n\nwhere functional traits are components of an organism\u2019s phenotype that influence ecosystem \n\nprocesses. There is an increasing body of literature demonstrating that functional diversity, \n\nrather than species diversity, enhances ecosystem functions such as productivity (Hooper and \n\nDukes, 2004; Hooper et al., 2005; Petchey et al., 2004; Tilman et al., 1997), resilience to \n\nperturbations or invasion (Bellwood et al., 2004), and regulation in the flux of matter \n\n(Waldbusser et al., 2004). As functional diversity consists of the range and values of key \n\nmorphological and physiological traits, communities with high numbers of species but low \n\nfunctional diversity can be said to have high functional redundancy (Petchey et al., 2007). This \n\nis because high functional redundancy occurs when species overlap in their traits, which may \n\nreflect niche overlap if traits are defined in a biologically appropriate way (D??az and Cabido, \n\n2001). Conversely, when each species present in a community represents a unique \n\ncombination of traits, there is low functional redundancy. The most critical assumption in this \n\nformulation of functional redundancy is that the traits under consideration are those \n\ndetermining ecosystem functioning (Walker et al., 1999). High functional redundancy may \n\nresult in limited loss of ecosystem functioning with species loss, while in communities with \n\nlow functional redundancy, the loss of even a few species could have dramatic consequences \n\nfor ecosystem functioning. According to Vill\u00e9ger et al., (2008), FD can be divided into three \n\nprimary components \u2013 functional richness (FRic), functional divergence (FDiv) and functional \n\nevenness (FEve). FRic represents the amount of functional space occupied by a species \n\nassemblage. FEve corresponds to how regularly species abundances are distributed in the \n\nfunctional space. Finally, FDiv defines how far high species abundances are from the center of \n\nthe functional space. These facets are complementary and jointly describe the distribution of \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n\t\n\n29\t\n\nspecies and their abundances within the functional space.  \n\nAn important consideration for such a trait-based approach is to identify which \n\nfunctional traits and which species are relevant (Suding et al., 2008). Response traits are \n\nimportant because they indicate how species respond to environmental change, whereas effect \n\ntraits are important because they indicate how species affect ecosystem processes (Lavorel and \n\nGarnier, 2002). Not all species are of equal importance for ecosystem processes; as dominant \n\nspecies make up the bulk of the community biomass, they will also be responsible for most of \n\nthe ecosystem fluxes in energy and resources (Garnier et al., 2004). \n\nPD measures the evolutionary differences among species based on times since \n\ndivergence from a common ancestor (Faith, 1992), representing an estimate of \n\nphylogenetically conserved ecological and phenotypic differences among species (Cavender-\n\nBares et al. 2009). This dimension may characterize the long-term evolutionary potential of \n\nspecific clades to respond or adapt to current and future environments. Few studies have \n\nexplored the influences of anthropic landscapes on FD or PD (Tscharntke et al., 2012), and \n\nmost of which have focused on plant and invertebrate assemblages (e.g., Arroyo-Rodr\u00edguez et \n\nal. 2012; Aviron et al. 2005; Laliberte et al. 2010). \n\n FD and PD were both advocated as two important facets of diversity respectively for \n\nensuring the provision of goods and services (D\u00edaz et al., 2007) and for representing an \n\nevolutionary history of conservation interest (Knapp et al., 2008; Mace et al., 2003). Metrics \n\nother than traditional diversity indices may thus be necessary to picture the actual trends. For \n\nexample, a net increase in regional species richness may be accompanied by a decrease in \n\nfunctional diversity (Vill\u00e9ger et al., 2010), or two communities of equal TD may be composed \n\nof species with either highly similar or different phylogenetic histories (Forest et al., 2007). \n\nSimilarly, any estimated measure of FD can also be decoupled from PD if some functional \n\ntraits are under strong stabilizing selection or owing to competitive interactions within \n\nlineages (Prinzing et al., 2008). Taken together, the use of a multifaceted approach to describe \n\nthe spatial distribution of biodiversity has recently proved to be useful for describing how \n\nbiodiversity covaries in space, unravelling assembly mechanisms (Cadotte, 2013) and \n\nunderstanding the drivers explaining community composition (e.g. Bernard-Verdier et al., \n\n2013; Graham et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2012; Pavoine et al., 2009). Measuring each of these \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n\t\n\n30\t\n\ncomplementary biodiversity components is thus necessary for understanding the complete \n\nstructure, composition and dynamics of natural communities (Maherali and Klironomos, \n\n2007). Adopting an integrated view of biodiversity is also a great challenge for conservation \n\nplanning.  \n\nFunctional indicators can also greatly improve predicting the functions or services \n\nprovided by an ecosystem as they are proxies for the rate, or relative importance, of particular \n\nprocesses (Vandewalle et al., 2010). If the traits that determine species response to \n\nenvironmental change or disturbance positively correlate with those that determine functional \n\nimportance, then functional trait composition and overall ecosystem function may also change \n\ndramatically (Petchey and Gaston, 2006b). However, this concept is yet a neglected \n\ncomponent in biodiversity monitoring programmes in most ecosystems (Feld et al., 2009).  \n\n \n\n1.4. The Cerrado \n Brazil harbors outstanding biodiversity, sharing with Indonesia the top two positions of \n\nthe world\u2019s \u201cMegadiverse\u201d countries (Mittermeier et al., 2000). However, not all Brazilian \n\nbiomes have merited equal attention. While the Amazon and the Atlantic Forest have merited \n\nglobal recognition, the Cerrado has remained forgotten by scientists, environmentalists and \n\ngeneral public, facing an increasingly threatening anthropic pressure. \n\nThe Cerrado is located in the center of Brazil, bordered by the Amazon forest to the \n\nnorth, the Atlantic forest to the south and southeast, and the caatinga to the northeast (Fig. \n\n1.2). The 2nd largest biome of South America, this tropical savanna stretches for about 1, \n\n500,000 km2. Because of its wide latitudinal and altitudinal ranges, has great climatic and \n\nenvironmental diversity, encompassing considerable habitat heterogeneity. Ecological factors \n\nhave acted in synergy to shape the native vegetation into several physiognomies. The typical \n\nvegetation consists of a mosaic of savanna, forest and grassland formations. The savanna \n\nformations are generally located on well-drained interfluves, whereas gallery forests follow \n\nthe watercourses. As a consequence of this heterogeneity, the Cerrado presents high species \n\nrichness and endemism of plants and vertebrates (Colli et al., 2002; Klink and Machado, \n\n2005). \n\nThe Cerrado includes much of central Brazil and parts of northeastern Paraguay and \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n\t\n\n31\t\n\neastern Bolivia (Ab\u2019Saber, 1977), occupiyng a central position in relation to other large South \n\nAmerican biomes, with extensive borders with the two largest forest biomes (Amazonia and \n\nAtlantic Forest) as well as with the two largest dry regions (Caatinga and Chaco).  \n\nThe Cerrado has a tropical wet and dry climate with intermediate rainfall between the \n\nwetter regions to the northwest and southeast and the drier areas to the northeast. Average \n\nannual rainfall varies between 125 and 200 cm and average annual temperature between 20\u00b0 \n\nand 26\u00b0 C (Ab\u2019Saber 1977). The dry period lasts from 3 to 5 consecutive months (generally \n\nbetween May and September or October), during the winter of the Southern Hemisphere \n\n(Sarmiento 1983).  \n\n \nFigure 1.2.

This geomorphological variation explains much of the distribution of \n\nplants in the Cerrado (Cole 1986). Savannas are the dominant phytophysiognomy, covering \n\naround 72% of the region, but patches of dry forests and complex belts composed of both dry \n\nforests and savannas give the region a mosaic-like aspect (Fig. 1.3) (Cardoso Da Silva and \n\nBates, 2002). About 24% of the region represents this mosaic of savanna\u2013forest transition, \n\nwith a remaining 4% being dry forest. The tops of the plateaus are flat, gently rolling surfaces \n\nat elevations ranging from 500 to 1700 m. They are covered primarily by cerrado, a \n\nsemideciduous to evergreen savanna-like vegetation growing on the deep, well-drained, and \n\nnutrient-poor soils (Eiten 1990). Five main structural types of cerrado are recognized by \nbotanists (Eiten 1972): i) cerrad\u00e3o, a dense forest type (8\u201315 m tall) that often has a \n\ncompletely closed canopy; ii) cerrado sensu stricto, a woodland (5\u20138 m tall) with closed scrub \n\nand more scattered trees than in cerrad\u00e3o; iii) campo cerrado, an open scrubland (3\u20136 m tall) \n\nwith few trees; iv) campo sujo, grassland (2\u20133 m tall) with scattered shrubs; v) campo limpo, \n\ngrassland with few or no shrubs or taller woody plants.  \n\n Besides cerrado, other types of distinct savanna vegetation, called campos \n\nrupestres, and miscellaneous lithosolic campos occur on rocky outcrops. These habitats are \n\nlimited to small patches on the plateaus and have a highly endemic flora (Eiten 1990). Narrow \n\nfringes of gallery forest often border small rivers and streams of the region. Gallery forests on \n\nthe plateaus grow on narrow belts of soils rich in organic matter (Eiten 1990). They are \n\nevergreen, have trees that are on average 20\u201330 m tall, and possess a dense understory of low \n\nstature (Ribeiro and Walter, 2008). Commonly associated with gallery forests are stands of a \n\nspecies of palm, Mauritia flexuosa, locally known as veredas. The peripheral depressions are \n\ngenerally flat surfaces of little relief (100\u2013500 m in elevation) that are ocasionally inter- rupted \n\nby the presence of steep-sided hills.  \n\n The percentage of species endemic to the Cerrado varies across different groups of \n\norganisms: vascular plants (44%), amphibians (30%), reptiles (20%), mammals (11.8%), and \n\nbirds (1.4%) (Myers et al., 2000). However, because large areas of the Cerrado remain \n\nunexplored (Silva, 1995), these numbers will likely change when additional biological \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n\t\n\n33\t\n\ninventories are conducted. At present, we still know little about how these endemic species are \n\ndistributed across the Cerrado or how they evolved. \n\n   \n\n \n\n1.4.1. The anthropization of the Brazillian savana \nUp to the mid-twentieth century, the Cerrado had no economic value and was \n\nunattractive due to the scrubby nature of the vegetation, apparent low faunal densities, \n\nFigure 1.3.

By the 1950\u2019s, the Brazilian government was \n\ndetermined to develop the \u201cempty\u201d center of the country, building the new capital city, \n\nBras\u00edlia, in the core of the Cerrado and stimulating agricultural development through \n\nsubsidies, tax incentives, loans and guaranteed prices. These incentives, along with the \n\ndevelopment of appropriate technologies enabled farmers to deal with nutrient-poor and acidic \n\nsoils, investing in large-scale fertilization, high yield/drought-resistant crop varieties and the \n\nheavy use of herbicides, pesticides and modern machinery. After all these agronomic \n\ninvestments, the Cerrado\u2019s wide grasslands and dry soil offered much less resistance to land \n\nclearing and mechanical mobilization than rainforests. \n\nOver the past six decades the Cerrado became Brazil\u2019s largest source of soybeans and \n\npastureland, a significant producer of rice, corn, and cotton (Klink et al., 1999). From a \n\nrevenue generation perspective, the benefits of commercial agriculture in the Cerrado are clear \n\nas soy is one of the main brazilian export commodities and the Cerrado supports the largest \n\ncattle herd in the country (Klink et al., 1999). Consequently, much of the biome\u2019s landscape \n\nbecame a mosaic of \u201cislands\u201d of native vegetation surrounded by vast areas of homogeneous \n\nagricultural lands. Nearly 50% of the Cerrado is currently under direct human use, and about \n\n35% of its total natural cover has been converted into planted pastures and crops (Allan, \n\n2003).  \n\n The frantic conversion of the Cerrado into a massive agricultural land may be a side \n\neffect of the international pressure to halt deforestation in the Amazon. In the search for \n\nalternatives, the Cerrado has often been targeted (Ab\u2019Saber et al. 1977). In fact, the Cerrado \n\nbovine herd as always been larger than the Amazon\u2019s and the percentage of area used for \n\ncrops has been superior in the Cerrado since 2005 (Fig. 1.4). The Brazilian government\u2019s \n\nappreciation for the uniqueness of the Cerrado\u2019s biodiversity has developed slowly. The first \n\nmajor conservation initiative occurred in 1997, when the Brazilian Ministry of Environment \n\npromoted a workshop, with over 200 scientific experts on the region, to define priority areas \n\nfor conservation in the biome. It followed the same methodology applied earlier for the \n\nAtlantic Forest and Amazonia (Cavalcanti 1999). Several criteria for assessing biodiversity \n\nvalue were used, such as number of endemic species, species richness, presence of rare or \n\nendangered species or both, and sites of unique communities or key areas for migratory \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n\t\n\n35\t\n\nspecies. The group identified a total of 87 priority areas that formed the basis for seting the \n\ncurrent protected areas in the biome (Fig. 1.5). The urgency for conservation action in a \n\npriority area was determined by cross-referencing biodiversity data with the human-pressure \n\nand land cover change data (Cavalcanti 1999). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.4.

Scientific knowledge and Biases \nUnlike forests, grassy biomes have long been viewed as anthropogenic artifacts, \n\ndegraded lands or secondary successional stages, often neglected by scientists and seen as \n\nuninteresting for conservationists (see for example Banerjee, 1995).  \n\nIn the year 2000, the Cerrado was classified as a global biodiversity hotspot due to \n\nhigh endemism rate and accelerated habitat loss and fragmentation (Klink and Machado, 2005; \n\nMyers et al., 2000). Although the extent of the environmental modification is less well \n\ndocumented than the economic transformation, the conversion of the Cerrado landscape is \n\nFigure 1.5.

Large areas of this biome \n\nwere never surveyed (Colli et al., 2002), suggesting that the known species richness is \n\nunderestimated (Diniz-Filho et al., 2005). Although scientific projects on the Cerrado include \n\nstudies on natural history (e.g. Alcantara et al., 2007; Durante et al., 2003) and community \n\nstructure (e.g. Diniz-Filho et al., 2004; Giaretta et al., 2008),  information on diversity \n\npatterns, habitat use and species distribution is still limited (Colli et al., 2002). Furthermore, \n\ndata on the influence of the widespread and intensive agricultural practices on the fauna of the \n\nCerrado is rare and often too basic. We searched the literature for original papers published \n\nfrom 1994 to 2014.

The Cerrado is the least studied biome and, among the \n\nconsidered taxa, amphibians are the least studied vertebrates. This trend is especially worrying \n\nbecause of the accelerated degradation of the Cerrado and the global decline of amphibian \n\npopulations. Research focusing on the biodiversity of the Cerrado has been increasing for the \n\nlast 20 years, but research focusing on the amphibians of the Cerrado is still incipient (Fig. \n\n1.7), especially considering the anthropogenic pressure on the biome. Furthermore, scientific \n\nresearch on the biodiversity of the Cerrado is extremely concentrated in the southern and \n\ncentral region of the biome (Fig. 1.8), whereas most of the biome has been disregarded \n\nprobably due to low funding and logistic impairments related to difficulty in sampling highly \n\nunaccessible areas. However, according to Valdujo et al., (2012), 19 amphibian species with \n\nrestricted distributions and/or endemic to the Cerrado are completely unprotected. Therefore, \n\nthe development of more scientific ecological studies on the anurofauna of this biome is \n\nurgent and paramount for the unbiased establishment of conservation policies. \n\n \n\n \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014\n\nN\num\n\nbe\nr \n\nof\n p\n\nap\ner\n\ns \npu\n\nbl\nis\n\nhe\nd \n\n(1\n99\n\n4-\n20\n\n14\n) \n\nBiodiversity Amphibians\n\nFigure 1.7.

Amphibians as surrogate species on ecological assessments \n Scientists first became concerned about widespread amphibian population declines at the \nFirst World Congress of Herpetology, in 1989. Currently many amphibian species are on the \n\nbrink of extinction, with 427 species (7.4%) listed as Critically Endangered (CR - the IUCN \n\nCategory of highest threat), compared with 179 birds (1.8%) and 184 mammals (3.8%) (Stuart \n\net al., 2004). The level of threat to amphibians is undoubtedly underestimated because 1294 \n\nspecies (22.5%) are too poorly known to assess (Data Deficient - DD), compared with only 78 \n\nbirds (0.8%) (Birdlife International, 2008) and 256 mammals (5.3%) (Stuart et al., 2004). A \n\nsignificant proportion of DD amphibians is likely to be globally threatened (Howard and \n\nBickford, 2014). Analysis of trends in population and habitat availability indicates a \n\ndeterioration in the status of amphibians since 1980 (Stuart et al., 2004), when 1772 species \n\n(31%) would have been globally threatened, including 231 species (4%) in the CR category. \n\nThus, in 1980, the percentage of CR amphibians would have been similar to that of mammals \n\ntoday, but the number of CR amphibians has almost doubled since then. Only 34 species of \n\namphibian are reported to have become extinct since 1500, compared with 129 birds (Birdlife \n\nInternational, 2008)) and 74 mammals (IUCN, 2015). There is strong evidence that this \n\nsituation is worsening because nine of these extinctions took place since 1980 (compared with \n\nfive birds (Birdlife International, 2008) and no mammals (IUCN, 2015). Various threats to \n\namphibians, such as global warming, habitat loss, disease vulnerability to chytrid fungus, and \n\npollution) have been identified (Bielby et al., 2006; Kiesecker et al., 2001; Lips et al., 2003; \n\nPounds, 2001; Pounds et al., 2006).  \nAmphibians have several characteristics that make them useful as indicator species \n\n(Heyer et al., 1994). They are often locally abundant (Rocha et al. 2001, Watanabe et al. 2005) \n\nand may be sampled with low-cost standard methods (Heyer et al. 1994, Pierce and Gutzwiller \n\n2004). It is likely that amphibians will be good indicators of changes to the whole ecosystem \n\nbecause they are sensitive to changes in the aquatic and terrestrial environments. Aquatic \n\nenvironment is required for reproduction in most species (Duellman and Trueb 1986) and the \n\npermeable skin of amphibians makes them sensitive  \n\n \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n\t\n\n41\t\n\nto water quality and UV radiation in the egg and larval as well as adult life stages (Gerlanc and \n\nKaufman 2005, Taylor et al. 2005). Many amphibian species spend much of their adult life in \n\nterrestrial environments, also responding to changes in these environments, especially those \n\naffecting water relations through their integument with behavioral responses (e.g., shifting \n\nactivity periods or moving to different microhabitats) or less frequently with phenotypic \n\nresponses (e.g., facultative lipid barrier adjustment; Lillywhite 2006). \n\nSome studies use amphibians as indicators of environmental contamination or pollution \n\n(e.g. Boone et al., 2007; Egea-Serrano et al., 2009). Others attempt to use the species \n\nassemblage (Sheridan and Olson 2003) or relative abundance (Campbell et al. 2005) as \n\nindicators of ecosystem health or habitat quality. Amphibians are among the most diverse and \n\nabundant vertebrates, play keystone roles in ecosystem functioning, acting as both predators \n\nand prey, and enabling nutrient transport between aquatic and terrestrial systems. They are \n\noften critical to aquatic and terrestrial food webs, often reaching high densities and biomass \n\n(Schiesari et al. 2009). Regarding human societies, amphibians have key roles in disease \n\ncontrol, control of agricultural pests (Lajmanovich et al. 2003; Attademo et al. 2005; Peltzer et \n\nal. 2005; Attademo et al. 2007; Peltzer et al. 2010), as food source, in pet trade, and medicinal \n\nresources (Valencia-Aguilar et al., 2013).  \n\n Given their ecological and economic importance, the extent to which threats to \n\namphibians could affect the provision of services should be assessed, especially in the highly \n\ndiverse and endangered Neotropics. However, the services provided by amphibians have \n\nrarely been considered among motivations for acting on their conservation status (Gratwicke \n\net al. 2010). The development of conservation plans for such species and their inclusion in \n\nendangered species categories could help protect the ecosystem services provided by these \n\norganisms. \n\n \n\n1.6. Amphibian dispersal in anthropogenic landscapes \nHabitat fragmentation leads to reduced patch size, increased patch isolation, and \n\nincreased risk of demographic, stochastic and genetic events (Cushman, 2005). This increases \n\nextinction risk by reducing demographic and genetic input from immigrants and reducing the \n\nchance of recolonization after extinction (Gulve, 1994; Lande, 1988). Spatial and temporal \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n\t\n\n42\t\n\npatterns of animal movement influence population regulation, metapopulation dynamics, and \n\nlong-term persistence of species (Semlitsch, 2008). Hence, understanding what facilitates and \n\nimpairs animal movement is pivotal for habitat management and conservation.  \n\n Given their biphasic life cycle, amphibians migrate to and from breeding sites, making \n\nmovement a crucial aspect of population persistence. However, amphibians have lower rates \n\nof movement per generation than invertebrates, mammals or reptiles (Bowne and Bowers, \n\n2004). Habitat connectivity has been regarded as key to regional viability of amphibian \n\npopulations (Cushman, 2005; Rothermel and Semlitsch, 2002; Todd and Rothermel, 2006). \n\nBreeding sites lacking connectivity to suitable terrestrial habitat may be population sinks due \n\nto high mortality of juveniles during emigration (Rothermel, 2004). Populations may decline if \n\nimmigration is impaired and may not be recolonized following a local extinction (Semlitsch \n\nand Bodie, 1998). Connectivity seems to be of particular importance even in pristine \n\nlandscapes, as amphibian populations experience relatively frequent local extinction and \n\nturnover (Trenham et al., 2003).  \n\n In anthropogenic landscapes, the effects of habitat fragmentation on juvenile dispersal \n\nare perceived as crucial for conserving pond breeding amphibians (Cushman, 2005). Low \n\nrecruitment of dispersing individuals probably plays a major role in decline and extinction of \n\namphibian populations in fragmented landscapes (Bulger et al., 2003). There are several \n\nimportant implications of habitat fragmentation on species persistence. High levels of post-\n\nmetamorphic survival are often required to maintain local populations, but substantial \n\nreductions in dispersal success and juvenile survival have been recorded in fragmented \n\nlandscapes (Cushman, 2005). Hence, habitat fragmentation per se can substantially reduce \n\npost-metamorphic survival and population connectivity, threatening population viability.  \n\nRecently, a number of studies have investigated the relationships between landscape \n\nstructure and amphibian dispersal. Both spotted salamanders and wood frogs avoid crossing \n\nfields, pastures, clear-cuts, lawns, and roads (deMaynadier and Hunter, 1999; Marsh et al., \n\n2004; Regosin et al., 2003; Rothermel and Semlitsch, 2002). Furthermore, orientation of both \n\nspotted salamander and wood frog is biased toward forest (Rothermel and Semlitsch, 2002). \n\nLower recapture rates in fields reflected high mortality rates due to desiccation and predation, \n\nsuggesting that fields are substantially resistant to amphibian dispersal, and thus forest \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n\t\n\n43\t\n\nfragmentation reduces dispersal rates for those species (Marsh et al., 2004; Rothermel and \n\nSemlitsch, 2002; Rothermel, 2004). \n\nIn order to understand the population-level implications of fragmentation, it is \n\nnecessary to move from site-specific inferences to assessments of how multiple factors interact \n\nacross larger spatial extents to influence population connectivity (Bowne and Bowers, 2004; \n\nMcGarigal and Cushman, 2002). Non-spatial studies conducted at local scales do not provide \n\na basis for inferences at the landscape or regional level (McGarigal and Cushman, 2002). \n\nLandscape-level studies that represent the spatial patterns of the environment, addressing \n\nspecies-specific dispersal are essential to extend fine-scale species environment relationships \n\nto the population-level (McGarigal and Cushman, 2002). \n\n Understanding amphibian movement is critical for effective management and \n\nconservation of amphibians (Rothermel and Semlitsch, 2002), especially in higly fragmented \n\nand unstable anthropogenic landscapes. Advances in technology such as radiotelemetry, stable \n\nisotope analysis, and use of microsatellite geneticmarkers have yielded greater resolution of \n\nthe movement ecology of amphibians. However, low funding often impairs the wide use of \n\nthese approaches. Hence, other techniques have been adopted to study how landscapes shape \n\namphibian meta-population dynamics, such as graph-theoretic approaches.  Graph-theoretic \n\napproaches may possess the greatest benefit-to-effort ratio for conservation problems that \n\nrequire characterization of large- scale connectivity, due to their ability to provide a detailed \n\npicture of connectivity with modest data requirements (Calabrese and Fagan, 2004).  \n\n1.7. Objectives and thesis framework \nAmphibian ecology is complex, characterized by an inherent duality of dependencies \n\nand vulnerabilities, a larval stage associated to waterbodies, an adult stage associated to \n\nterrestrial environments and a necessity to migrate to and from waterbodies as recently \n\nmetamorphosed individuals and as breeding adults. Because of that complex life cycle, \n\napproaching how amphibian populations are affected by human-mediated activities demands \n\nan integrated, thorough, landscape-scale perspective to reliantly evaluate how populations are \n\nshaped by anthropogenic activities. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n\t\n\n44\t\n\nAlthough studies spanning many taxa are important for uncovering general and robust \n\nrelationships between traits and extinction risk (Cardillo et al., 2008), they may conceal \n\nimportant taxon-specific associations. Many species\u2019 traits show relationships to extinction \n\nrisk to be inconciliable across species groups (Purvis et al., 2000), making more narrowly \n\nfocused studies important (Fisher &amp; Owens, 2004; Isaac &amp; Cowlishaw, 2004; Cardillo &amp; \n\nMeijaard, 2012), even though the results may be challenging to generalize.  \n\nI attempted to make a multidimensional and integrated evaluation of the effects \n\nanthropogenic activities have on the anurofauna of the Cerrado.  \n\nIn Chapter 2 I revised the literature to summarize the current knowledge on the effects \n\nof the main anthropogenic activities on the Cerrado on the biome\u2019s anurofauna. I found this \n\nimportant because there is still the misconception that fauna from arid biomes is composed of \n\ngeneralist and resilient species and, therefore, probably not affected by human activities. I also \n\nfound this review provided me with the ideal position to start assessing how the anurofauna of \n\nthe Cerrado was, is and will be affected by the anthropization of the biome. \n\nIn Chapter 3 I analyzed how anuran species traits related to current official extinction \n\nrisk and, based on those high extinction risk traits, I predicted the extinction risk for the whole \n\nanurofauna of the biome, including species DD. Based on species trait importance, I evaluated \n\nconservation targets for every species and propose an integrative framework for assessing \n\nspecies extinction risk and high priority areas for biomes with low funding and high \n\nantrohpogenic pressure.  \n\nIn Chapter 4 I performed and integrative evaluating of the effects of converting natural \n\nCerrado-Amazon ecotone habitats to a vast irrigated rice crop. I assessed taxonomic, \n\nfunctional and phylogenetic diversity and body condition as a metric of population fitness. I \n\nalso identified which traits are selected and eliminated in Neotropical rice crops. \n\nIn Chapter 5 I analyzed how local and landscape features affect overall functional \n\ndiversity, trait diversity and phylogenetic diversity. I also determined which landscape features \n\nare most important for maintaining the most diverse anuran communities in Neotropical \n\nagroecosystems. \n\nFinally, in Chapter 6 I approached the connectivity aspect of amphibian populations in \n\nanthropogenic landscapes. Using anuran diversity metrics as proxies for amphibian functional \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n\t\n\n45\t\n\nconnectivity I evaluated waterbody importance for connectivity in the sampled waterbody \n\nnetwork embedded in rice crops. I determined which landscape features are more important \n\nfor increasing amphibian functional connectivity in Neotropical rice crops.  \n\nIn Chapter 7 I summarize the main findings from the previous chapters, making \n\nmanagement recommendations and presenting priorities for future research projects. \n\n1.8.

THE ANUROFAUNA OF A VANISHING SAVANNA: THE CASE \nOF THE BRAZILIAN CERRADO \n\nJoana Ribeiroa, Guarino R. Collib, Amadeu M.V.M. Soaresa \n\n \na Department of Biology, University of Aveiro, Campus de Santiago, 3810-193 Aveiro, \n\nPortugal \nb Department of Zoology, University of Brasilia, 70910-900 Bras\u00edlia, DF, Brazil. \n\n \nUnder review in Biodiversity and Conservation \n\n \n \n2.1. Abstract  \n\n The Cerrado is the second largest biome in Brazil and has been vastly transformed \n\ninto a highly mechanized and intensive agricultural area, with very little public opposition. \n\nThe native anurofauna is rich in species number and endemism, but has long been regarded \n\nas a generalist community originated from neighboring biomes. The accelerated \n\ndegradation of Cerrado habitats and consequent landscape fragmentation caused by \n\nagricultural activities are invariably bound to affect local anuran communities. However, \n\nthe effects of these activities on native amphibians are seldom studied, despite the \n\nacknowledged adverse effects of these disturbances on the anurofauna elsewhere and the \n\nfact that amphibian populations worldwide are declining. This review aims to finally \n\ngather the most important findings on the effects of anthropogenic activities on local \n\namphibians. We synthesize the main existing Portuguese and English written literature on \n\nthe effects of the main anthropogenic activities on the Cerrado anurofauna, generally not \n\neasily accessible to the international scientific community. We found a clear paucity of \n\nstudies on ecology, demography and distribution of the Cerrado amphibians, especially \n\nwhen compared to other biomes and taxa. Yet, the few existing studies indicate that, while \n\nthis community may be more resilient to some anthropogenic activities (e.g. fire) than their \n\nforest counterparts, agricultural environments are strongly dominated by generalist species. \n\nNatural forest fragments are important features for maintaining a diverse anuran \n\ncommunity in agroecosystems. Intense agrochemical use has been acknowledged to cause \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n\t\n\n72\t\n\nhistopathologic alterations and potential decreased fitness. Chytridiomycosis has been \n\nrecorded in thirteen species extant in the biome, including endemics. The Cerrado \n\nanurofauna appears to be especially sensitive to hydroelectric dams, as even previously \n\ncommon, widespread and generalist species declined or disappeared after flooding. Latest \n\npredictions indicate that the occupation of the Cerrado will proceed northward, \n\ndramatically reducing the proportion of remaining natural habitats due to climate change, \n\nleading to a great loss of biodiversity. Only a small portion of suitable natural habitats will \n\nremain in northern Cerrado, with amphibian richness being reduced to less than half. Most \n\nspecies will undergo more contraction than expansion of suitable areas in 2050, with high \n\nextinction risk. Future climate changes will be especially detrimental for endemic anurans, \n\nwith small potential current distribution. We conclude that, contrary to widespread beliefs, \n\nthe biodiversity of the Amazon is not the only one experiencing aggressive threats in \n\nBrazil. The anurofauna of the Cerrado is under an unacknowledged extremely high \n\nextinction risk and in urgent need of more scientific studies and conservation and \n\nmanagement projects. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Amphibians; agriculture; fire; rice; soy. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Anurofauna of a vanishing savana: the case of the Brazilian Cerrado \n\n73\t\n\n\t\n\n \n\n2.2  Introduction\t\n\nUp to the mid-twentieth century the Cerrado had no economic value and was \n\noccupied by a few large extensive cattle farms, as the soil\u2019s low nutrient content and \n\nacidity, low faunal densities and lack of railroad access restricted agriculture. However, in \n\nthe 1950\u2019s various forms of government incentives stimulated the agricultural development \n\nof the biome and transformed it into Brazil\u2019s new agricultural frontier. The biome became \n\nthe country\u2019s main source of soybeans and host to the largest cattle herd nationwide (Klink \n\nand Moreira, 2002). It is estimated that ca. 40% of the Cerrado has already been converted \n\ninto crops and pastures (Sano et al, 2009), with a cumulative conversion of 43,6% in 2002 \n\nand 47,8% in 2008 (MMA/IBAMA/PNUD, 2010) and the highest annual conversion rate \n\n(0,7%) of the six Brazilian biomes from 2002 to 2008 (MMA/IBAMA/PNUD, 2011).  \n\n Although the bovine herd of the Cerrado was always larger than that of the \n\nAmazon, and the percentage of crop area is superior in the Cerrado since 2005 (Fig. 2), the \n\naccelerated anthropogenic conversion of the Brazilian savanna has proceeded with little \n\nopposition. In fact, this frantic conversion into vast agricultural areas may be a result of \n\ninternational pressure to halt deforestation in the Amazon (Ab\u2019Saber et al. 1990).  \n\n Global climate change and a growing human population are expected to increase \n\nthe frequency and severity of anthropogenic disturbances, which will pose broad effects on \n\nbiological diversity (McKenzie et al. 2004; Scholze et al. 2006; IPCC 2007). Species \n\nresponse to disturbance depends on the type and magnitude of disturbance, the amount and \n\nconfiguration of remaining habitat, and their life-history characteristics (Prugh et al. 2008; \n\nKuussaari et al. 2009). We aim to summarize the recorded effects of the main \n\nanthropogenic activities on the Cerrado amphibians. We will further elaborate on the \n\ncurrent decline risk for the biome\u2019s anurofauna based on what has been recorded and on \n\nthe ecophysiological traits characteristic of the biome\u2019s amphibians. \n\n \n\n2.3  The Cerrado anurofauna \n\nSouth-American amphibians are concentrated in the Atlantic and Amazon \n\nrainforests (Buckley &amp; Jetz 2007). Although savannas are commonly assumed to harbor an \n\nimpoverished anurofauna (e.g., Duellman 1993), recent studies have uncovered a \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n\t\n\n74\t\n\nsurprisingly rich Cerrado, with high anuran species richness (at least 204 species), \n\nincluding endemic, widespread, and marginal species (Valdujo et al. 2012). \n\n The Cerrado is linked to forest biomes and open domains through wide ecotones \n\nthat favor biological interchange. Communities are thus structured as a mosaic, assembled \n\nfrom multiple adjoining regional species pools (Valdujo et al. 2012). Of the 204 anuran \n\nspecies, 145 are considered typical as they consistently occur in the Cerrado and 59 as \n\nmarginal, known only from ecotones (Colli et al. 2002). Furthermore, 102 species are \n\nendemic or near endemic. Hence, most occurring species are restricted or strongly \n\nassociated to the Cerrado, while only a smaller proportion is widespread  (Valdujo et al. \n\n2012). \n\n Amphibians are ectothermic, have permeable skin and low dispersal ability, \n\nresulting in higher ecophysiological constraints (Hillman et al. 2009). As rainfall and \n\ntemperature determine tropical anuran phenology, the marked seasonality and high spatial \n\nheterogeneity of the Cerrado have profound effects on anuran ecology. Accordingly, \n\nCerrado anurans have developed numerous behavioral adaptations to resist desiccation and \n\nmaximize survival in adverse conditions. Diurnal species of anurans, common in the \n\nhumid Amazon and Atlantic Forests, are relatively rare in the Cerrado (Heyer et al. 1990). \n\nFossorial behaviors are very common among Cerrado anurans, hiding underground, in \n\nholes or under the leaf litter in order to avoid high temperatures and/or low humidity. \n\nBreeding strategies are also adapted to the environmental restrictions of the biome as most \n\nanurans breed only during the rainy season (October to April) in temporary waterbodies \n\nlocated in open vegetation areas (Brand\u00e3o and Araujo 1998, Vasconcellos &amp; Colli 2009). \n\nLeptodactylus sp. commonly dig burrows and build foam nests for their clutch, protecting \n\nagainst predators and facilitating physiological processes such as respiration, excretion and \n\nwater regulation (Prado et al. 2002, Giaretta and Kokubum 2003, Prado et al. 2005, \n\nKokubum &amp; Giaretta 2005). Foam nests also minimize the increase of temperature and  \n\ndecrease of air/soil moisture in unfavorable conditions such as drought or intense heat, \n\nboth frequent in the biome. \n\nAlthough empirically seen as more resilient to anthropogenic practices than their \n\nforest counterparts, it is almost certain that, given the magnitude of the ongoing \n\nanthropogenic activities, the Cerrado\u2019s biodiversity is being affected at ecosystem, \n\ncommunity and population levels (see Brooks et al., 2002). \n\n\n\nThe Anurofauna of a vanishing savana: the case of the Brazilian Cerrado \n\n75\t\n\n\t\n\n  \n\n \n\n2.4 Effects of the main anthropogenic activities on the Cerrado anurans \n\n The main economic activities in the Cerrado are agriculture and cattle farming. \n\nAgriculture has important and complex effects on biodiversity, causing both habitat loss \n\nand pesticide contamination, regarded as the main causes for amphibian declines \n\nworldwide (Beebee and Griffiths 2005). Agriculture causes spatial and temporal habitat \n\nhomogenization and decreased suitability of anuran breeding areas (Piha 2006). Crop and \n\npasture setting requires previous land clearing, often with prescribed fires, altering habitat \n\nstructure, removing the canopy, exposing the floor to sunlight and wind, which leads to a \n\nwarmer, drier surface microclimate, reducing leaf litter and food resources (Ash 1997, \n\nZheng et al. 2000). These conditions may expose amphibians to warmer and drier \n\nmicroclimate conditions, leading to lower survival or higher evacuation of habitats (Todd \n\nand Rothermel 2006, Semlitsch  2008).  \n\n Other economic activities, such as hydroelectric exploration, are also prominent in \n\nthe biome, and cause extensive damage to landscape and biodiversity.  \n\n The next section of this review will summarize the main anthropogenic activities \n\noccurring in the Cerrado and the studies on their effects on amphibians.  \n\n \n\n2.4.1 Fire \n\nFire is an important feature of the Cerrado and its flora and fauna are naturally \n\nresistant to it (Coutinho, 1982). However, fire regimes have been tremendously affected by \n\nrural activities in the last 20 years. Natural fires occur during the wet season, usually \n\ncaused by lightning, typically briefer, shallower and colder than prescribed fires. The \n\ncurrent main cause of fire in the Cerrado is agricultural and its purpose to transform the \n\nnative vegetation into crops or pastures (Coutinho 1990). Prescribed fires are hotter and \n\ncause increased soil temperature, affecting deeper soil layers. Even in a fire-prone biome, \n\nanthropogenic fires may alter soil moisture and temperature, vegetation structure, litter \n\nthickness and erosion rates (Schurbon and Fauth 2003). \n\n Drummond (2009) studied the effect of fire on anurans from campos rupestres, a \n\nfire-prone Cerrado physiognomy (Moreira, 1996), and recorded an increase in species \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n\t\n\n76\t\n\nrichness after the fire and an increase in the abundance of the two endemic species of \n\ncampos rupestres, Physalaemus erythros and Scinax curicica. Although many species \n\nwere recorded after the fire, every species was represented by only a few individuals. \n\nFurthermore, all species found after the fire are known to be resilient to environmental \n\nchanges such as Dendropsophus minutus, Scinax squalirostris, Scinax fuscovarius, \n\nLeptodactylus latrans, L. fuscus and Rhinella pombali (IUCN 2013). The author also found \n\na higher frequency of terrestrial species, often considered more resistant to fire than \n\narboreal species (Friend, 1993), as they remain buried during the dry season.  \n\n The burying habit has been recorded for several Cerrado anurans such as \n\nPhysalaemus sp. (Santos et al., 2003) and Leptodactylus sp. (Oliveira Filho et al., 2005). \n\nThese species also build foam nests, known to prevent clutch desiccation and provide \n\nthermal stability (Dobkin &amp; Gettinger, 1985). These fire-resistance features, common in \n\nsavanna amphibians, may explain the increased abundance of terrestrial species after fires, \n\nespecially when compared to forest communities.  \n\n Despite also being considered resistant to anthropogenic disturbances, Ischnocnema \n\njuipoca was abundant throughout the area before the fire, but rarely found afterwards. \n\nSpecies of Brachicephalidae, such as I. juipoca, are completely terrestrial, have direct \n\ndevelopment and find shelter at the base of grass clumps (Eterovick and Sazima, 2004). \n\nConsequently, once the vegetation of the area was swept by fire, mortality of I. juipoca \n\nwas likely substantial. Furthermore, this species may lays its eggs at the base of grass \n\nclumps, due to the higher water availability (Eterovick and Sazima, 2004), but in a soil \n\ndevoid of grasses and exposed to desiccation, reproductive success may be low in \n\nenvironments recently burned. Hence, I. juipoca may be especially susceptible to fire \n\ndespite its association to a fire prone phytophysiognomy.  \n\n The author also detected an increase in microhabitat use and inter-specific \n\ncompetition in arboreal anurans after the fire. This can be associated with the destruction \n\nof preferred microhabitats available in marginal and aquatic vegetation, suggesting the use \n\nof sub-optimal microhabitats by this group after the fire. Arboreal species showed a large \n\nproportion of empty stomachs, smaller prey and lower total volume of prey compared to \n\nterrestrial species. These results confirm those by Rocha et al. (2008), who found a \n\nnegative effect of fire on the diet of Scinax sp.. \n\n\n\nThe Anurofauna of a vanishing savana: the case of the Brazilian Cerrado \n\n77\t\n\n\t\n\n Amphibians are carnivores with a diet composed mostly of arthropods (Ara\u00fajo et \n\nal., 2007; Almeida-Gomes, 2007). Fire may have negatively affected the arthropod \n\ncommunity, reducing prey availability for amphibians. While treefrogs were negativelly \n\naffected, terrestrial species seemed unaffected because arthopods such as termites and ants \n\nbuild underground nests and resist fires (Vasconcelos et al. 2008), being available as prey \n\nto terrestrial frogs. However, arboreal anurans are unlikely to forage on terrestrial preys. \n\n These results were corroborated by Brasileiro (2004), who found anuran species \n\nrichness and abundance to be unaffected by fire and higher interspecific competition for \n\ncalling and egg-laying sites following the elimination of emergent vegetation by fire. \n\nMorais, C\u00f4rtes and Bastos (2011) studied the influence of fire on co-occurrence patterns of \n\nanurans in veredas, linear environments associated to watercourses (Oliveira &amp; Ratter, \n\n2002), composed of hydrophilic vegetation and characterized by a dense herbaceous layer \n\nand dominance of the arboreal palmtree Mauritia flexuosa (Ribeiro &amp; Walter, 2008). The \n\nauthors observed that co-occurrence patterns, anuran species composition and richness \n\nwere not significantly influenced by fire.  \n\n Fire-induced vegetation changes can increase water temperature, alter water \n\nholding capacity of plants and soil and lead to changes in the timing of peak and low-water \n\nevents (Rieman and Clayton, 1997). Thermal stress and rapid changes in water chemistry \n\nmay cause mortality of some species in ponds or streams (Spencer and Hauer, 1991). \n\nHowever, tadpoles of some Cerrado anurans are known to be resilient to several \n\nenvironmental changes. Larvae of Scinax fuscovarius and Leptodactylus fuscus tolerate \n\nhigh water temperature (Schinia and Neto, 1990), and low oxygen levels, which may be \n\ncommon in waterbodies with sparse vegetation. Eterovick &amp; Sazima (2000) argue that the \n\nsame can happen for tadpoles of Leptodactylus cunicularius, Leptodactylus furnarius and \n\nPhysalaemus cuvieri. In fact, intense fire in watersheds can result in increased \n\nconcentrations of nutrients such as phosphorus, ammonium, nitrate, and nitrite in \n\nwaterbodies, which may increase the productivity of aquatic ecosystems, providing more \n\nfood and, therefore result in faster growth of resilient herbivorous anuran larvae (Kiffney \n\nand Richardson, 2001). \n\nDespite their ecophysiological constraints, the main effects of fire on amphibians are \n\nmost likely indirect, as fire often creates an inhospitable environment associated with \n\nprofound alterations to the leaf litter, ground cover, and soil. Loss of cover can result in \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n\t\n\n78\t\n\nexposure to extreme temperatures, desiccation, high predation risk, physiological stress \n\nand reduced dispersal and foraging abilities. Several studies (e.g. Cano &amp; Leynaud, 2010, \n\nMatthews et al., 2010) found negative effects of fire on anuran assemblages and suggested \n\nthat fire may reduce species richness and abundance. However, and despite the paucity of \n\nstudies, it appears that species native from grassy biomes exhibit some remarkable \n\nresilience to burning due to behavioral traits and reproductive strategies. Nonetheless, \n\nsome species may be especially threatened. \n\n Vulnerability to fire varies as forest communities may be especially sensitive \n\n(Gardner, Barlow and Peres, 2007), while savanna communities such as the Cerrado may \n\nbe more resilient. Nevertheless, long-term studies must be developed to clarify the effects \n\nof fire on the diverse Cerrado anurofauna, especially regarding anthropogenic fires \n\n(Morais, C\u00f4rtes and Bastos, 2011) and the effects of altering fire regimes from superficial, \n\nlighting-caused, rainy season fires to more aggressive, anthropogenic fires set during the \n\ndry season. \n\n \n\n2.4.2 Crops \n\n The influence of agriculture on amphibian populations has been reported for many \n\nregions (e.g. Beja and Alcazar 2003). Agricultural activities are varied in nature, timing \n\nand gravity for biodiversity. Overall, effects are complex and dependent on characteristics \n\nsuch as timing, vegetation structure and cover, species cultivated, plant density and row-\n\nspacing. Habitat loss, decreased connectivity and water contamination are the most \n\nconspicuous effects of agriculture on amphibians worldwide (Liner et al. 2008).  However, \n\nthe potential an activity has to be detrimental to amphibians depends on the nature of the \n\nactivity, how directly the amphibians are exposed to it and on the ability amphibians have \n\nto resist or escape the threat. Naturally, activities that occur during the time period \n\namphibians are more active have higher probability of affecting amphibians than activities \n\noccurring on a period during which amphibians are not vulnerable (Fig. 2.1). Hence, when \n\nanalyzing how anthropogenic activities may affect biodiversity, it is pivotal to consider \n\nspecies characteristics. \n\n\n\nThe Anurofauna of a vanishing savana: the case of the Brazilian Cerrado \n\n79\t\n\n\t\n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\nDespite the ecological value of the world\u2019s most diverse savanna, and the \n\nomnipresence of human-mediated activities on the Cerrado, few studies have addressed the \n\ninfluence of agriculture on the biome\u2019s anuran communities. \n\n Among the main crops of the Cerrado, soybean and rice originate different \n\nmicroclimatic conditions, distinct resource and refuge availability, posing different \n\nsurvival risks for local anurans (Fig. 2.2). The conversion of native Cerrado habitats into \n\nsoybean crops and rice fields causes a significant reduction in evapotranspiration and an \n\nincrease in water flow (Nosetto et al. 2011). In denser crops, with smaller row spacing, soil \n\ntemperature may be lower than in soils covered by native vegetation and leaf litter less \n\nabundant and more homogeneous in crops. Furthermore, in the Cerrado, crop plantation \n\noften occurs when anurans are most active (beginning of the rainy season), which may be \n\nespecially detrimental to individuals migrating from hibernation shelters to breeding sites. \n\nFire \n\nLimestone &amp; \nfertilizers \n\nPloughing &amp; \ncrop sowing \n\nCrop  \nharvesting \n\nClear-cutting \n\nDay \nLate rainy season \n\nDay &amp; night \nLate dry season \n\nDay \nEarly rainy season \n\nDay &amp; night \nLate dry season \n\nDay &amp; night \nLate rainy season \n\nFigure 2.1.

Consequences of the main activities involved in most agricultural activities, with \n\npossible consequences for the anurofauna present in agro-environments.

Soy crops \n\nSilva et al. (2009) assessed the anuran community in agro-systems and found only \n\nterrestrial species in soy crops (Leptodactylus mystacinus, Physalaemus cuvieri and \n\nPhysalaemus nattereri). Physalaemus nattereri, a burrowing frog (Freitas et al., 2001), was \n\nthe only species found in all crops, perhaps because it can remain burrowed until the \n\nfollowing reproductive season, escaping many of the disturbances. According to Gray et al. \n\n(2004), agricultural disturbance around wetlands may positively influence the abundance \n\nof some amphibian species. Less vagile amphibians that aestivate and breed explosively \n\nare competitively dominant in the absence of predators and may benefit from landscape \n\ncultivation (Gray et al. 2004). Agricultural landscapes may therefore have a negative \n\ninfluence on anuran communities, causing decreases in species richness or favoring the \n\noccurrence of generalist species as a result of changes to the vegetation. \n\n Vaz-Silva (2009) found that areas distant from monocultures showed higher \n\ntadpole heterogeneity, species richness and abundance of treefrogs. Furthermore, \n\nmicrohabitat availability was higher in waterbodies distant from crops, providing more \n\ncalling sites and refuges for adults and larvae. Overall, S. fuscovarius, Dendropsophus \n\nminutus and E. nattereri were the most abundant species but, while E. nattereri was \n\ncommon in smaller, colder, shallower waterbodies located close to crops, tadpoles from D. \n\nminutus were associated with larger, warmer, deeper, with low pH waterbodies, distant \n\nfrom soy crops and closer to forest fragments. Microhabitat use was higher in agricultural \n\nenvironments and most species found in both pristine and agricultural waterbodies had \n\nsmaller niches in agricultural waterbodies. In areas distanced from the crops, D. minutus \n\nand S. fuscovarius displayed wider niches, suggesting great environmental plasticity \n\nregarding microhabitat use. In areas near crops, E. nattereri and L. fuscus behaved as \n\ngeneralist species, with broad niches. \n\n Morais et. al. (2011) found species richness in waterbodies located near soybean \n\ncrops to be high and similar to that of protected areas in the biome (Eterovick and Sazima \n\n2004, Uetanabaro et al. 2007). However, most of the recorded species were widespread \n\n(Frost 2010), open area breeders and habitat generalists (Brasileiro et al. 2005). \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n\t\n\n82\t\n\n \n\n Campos et al. (2013) found higher species richness and abundance in temporary \n\nlentic waterbodies on an agricultural matrix, corroborating previous studies (e.g. Prado et \n\nal. 2005, Santos et al. 2007, Vasconcelos et al. 2008). Structural habitat heterogeneity and \n\nlarval development plasticity account for the increased species richness and relative \n\nabundance in temporary ponds compared to lotic waterbodies and permanent lagoons. \n\nDiverse vertical strata favors a wider array of species, including hylids, leptodactylids and \n\nleiuperids, whereas lotic waterbodies typically have less diversified marginal vegetation \n\nand favor a smaller array of species commonly with strong breeding specializations. \n\nHowever, lentic temporary waterbodies harbored many generalist species associated to \n\nanthropogenic environments. \n\n \n\n2.4.2.2. Rice crops \n\nDespite the modifications ensuing the replacement of native vegetation by rice \n\ncrops and the alterations to the hydrological cycle resulting from irrigation techniques, rice \n\nfields often harbor many species (Elphick 2004; Doody et al. 2006) and have been \n\nconsidered \u201cfunctional equivalents\u201d to natural wetlands (Elphick 2000). \n\n Given the actual expansion of rice crops in the Neotropics, and particularly in the \n\nCerrado, it is important to determine if agricultural wetlands can maintain high levels of \n\nbiodiversity. Several studies have analyzed biodiversity patterns in fragmented wetlands in \n\nBrazil (Stenert and Maltchik, 2007; Rolon et al., 2008; Stenert et al., 2008), but the \n\nimportance of rice fields to the conservation of Neotropical amphibians has been \n\noverlooked. Since wetlands serve as important breeding sites for most amphibians, \n\nalterations to these systems can compromise several anuran species (Silvano and Segalla, \n\n2005). \n\n Irrigated rice fields in Brazil present a dynamic hydrologic regime, with variation \n\nbetween aquatic and terrestrial phases, remaining without surface water during the fallow \n\nphase, when the crop is drained and rice sowed. Despite rice being one of the main cash \n\ncrops of the Cerrado, there are no studies on the effects of rice crops on anuran \n\ncommunities.  \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Anurofauna of a vanishing savana: the case of the Brazilian Cerrado \n\n83\t\n\n\t\n\nDur\u00e9 (2008) studied the anuran community of irrigated rice fields in the \n\nArgentinian savannah and found a diverse anurofauna similar to that found in undisturbed \n\nwetlands, as was previously recognized by Bambaradeniya et al. (2004).  However, they \n\nalso found that natural vegetation supported the highest species richness. This underscores \n\nthe importance of retaining patches of natural vegetation in rice paddies to maintain \n\ndiverse anuran communities. Earthen irrigation ditches also assure conditions for diverse \n\nanuran microhabitats, especially useful for dispersal from natural vegetation into flooded \n\nrice fields. Bambaradeniya et al. (2004) found that aquatic organisms were able to use dry \n\nrice field soil cracks and crevices for aestivation when the fields were drained. This finding \n\nis corroborated by Dur\u00e9 (2008), who found adults and foam nests in cracks after field \n\ndrying. Perennial pools with aquatic vegetation may explain the presence of frogs in rice \n\nfields and indicate the importance of such features for anuran populations. The existence of \n\naquatic species, such as Lysapsus limellum, in an environment subjected to drastic water \n\nlevels variations was also of interest. The existence of pools that contain aquatic vegetation \n\nthroughout the terrestrial dry phase, would explain the presence of these frogs.  \n\nMachado and Maltchik (2010) investigated the potential role of rice fields as \n\nrefugia for amphibians and how different management practices could influence the \n\namphibian community. Twelve anuran species were found in the rice fields, representing \n\n75% of the area\u2019s species richness (Loebmann, 2005). However, species composition in \n\npristine wetlands differed from that found in rice fields, mainly regarding the dominance of \n\nhylids and leptodactylids. Furthermore, anuran richness and abundance changed over the \n\nrice cultivating cycle, peaking in the growing phases, during the warmer summer, with \n\nabundant surface water. This study showed that even though management practices in rice \n\nfields produced similar anuran richness and abundance, species composition is different \n\nfrom pristine areas. Lack of surface water in dry rice fields during most of the cultivating \n\ncycle favored the development of terrestrial species, such as Bufonidae, Cycloramphidae, \n\nand Leptodactylidae whereas in rice fields that remained flooded, hylids were more \n\nabundant. Hence, the mosaic created by rice wetlands and drained lands can harbor high \n\nanuran diversity but rice fields must not be viewed as surrogate systems for natural \n\nwetlands, given that the more complex natural systems harbor more diverse communities, \n\ninfluence aquifer recharge, climatic stability and water storage. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n\t\n\n84\t\n\nMoreira et al. (2014) recorded 60% of region\u2019s total species richness in rice fields, \n\nwith dominance of open areas species. Indeed, it has been argued that only generalist \n\nspecies are able to remain in areas converted to rice fields (Doody et al. 2006; Piatti et al. \n\n2010). Amphibians that depend on ponds in agricultural fields may be exposed to high \n\nlevels of agrochemicals, which could affect biota directly or indirectly (Peltzer et al. 2008; \n\nAttademo et al. 2011). Agricultural intensification also affects the structure of habitat in \n\nwhich amphibians forage and reproduce (Peltzer et al. 2006; Piatti et al. 2010). Non-\n\nspecialized reproductive modes (e.g. mode 1 sensu Haddad and Prado 2005) or those that \n\nconfer some protection against desiccation (e.g., modes 11 and 30) are more favored in \n\nopen areas or environments with seasonal availability of water, such as rice fields. \n\nTemporary environments are more likely to dry up and be occupied by species with rapid \n\ndevelopment and those that build foam nests, which allow the larvae to survive until the \n\nnext rain/flood (Zina and Haddad 2006). Indeed, the authors found a higher number of \n\ntadpoles of species that deposit eggs in foam nests inside subterranean constructed \n\nchambers (mode 30). Despite rice fields being often perceived as potential surrogate \n\nhabitats for many wetland species (Machado and Maltchik 2010), tadpole abundance was \n\nlow. Although the presence of tadpoles might be a good indicator that rice crops are \n\neffectively used for breeding activity, this must be heeded cautiously, as tadpoles might \n\nhave originally occurred in other flooded areas and then ended up in the rice fields via \n\nirrigation water. Fish that generally prey upon tadpoles were observed inside rice quadrats \n\nand irrigation channels, which, in addition to the predation effect on tadpoles and adults, \n\ninfluences breeding site selection by amphibians (Werner et al. 2007).  Additive or \n\nsynergistic effects of pesticide use and habitat homogenization on tadpole predation have \n\nbeen demonstrated in amphibians (Mann et al. 2009). Thus, fish predation associated with \n\nlow tadpole abundance could explain species absence during the late growing period. The \n\nauthors also found hylid tadpoles in organic rice fields, which may be associated with the \n\npresence of a strip of vegetation close to these rice plots. During the off-season, organic \n\ncrops retain water in the irrigation and drainage canals, ephemeral pools are common in the \n\nrice plots. Conventional fields are drained and sometimes used for cattle grazing. It has \n\nbeen suggested that hydroperiod predicts tadpole guild composition in grasslands (Santos \n\net al. 2007; Both et al. 2011). In this case, presence of hylid tadpoles in organic fields \n\nmight simply be related to longer hydroperiods. However, this does not exclude other \n\n\n\nThe Anurofauna of a vanishing savana: the case of the Brazilian Cerrado \n\n85\t\n\n\t\n\neffects of organic management, such as no or little use of chemical pesticides/inorganic \n\nfertilizers and maintenance of a heterogeneous landscape around crop edges, of \n\ncontributing to abundance in nearby areas.  \n\nMaltchik et al. (2011) investigated if irrigation channels could maintain high anuran \n\ndiversity over the cultivation cycle and found species corresponding to 63% of the richness \n\nobserved in the studied region (Loebmann 2005). However, anuran community was \n\nstrongly dominated by L. latrans, P. minuta, and P. biligonigerus, all generalist and highly \n\nadaptable species (Loebmann 2005). \n\n Crops can maintain apparently viable anuran populations despite the fact that the \n\nmain anuran breeding and feeding season may occur during cropping. However, there will \n\nbe a dominance of generalist, widespread, open area breeders and terrestrial species. In \n\nparticular, rice fields appear to have the potential to support diverse anuran communities, \n\ndue to certain characteristics of rice production, namely the need to flood the crop. \n\nHowever, natural vegetation fragments, earthen irrigation channels and shallow \n\ndepressions that support perennial ponds and aquatic vegetation must be assured as they \n\nappear to be important landscape features for promoting the use of rice fields by anurans. \n\nNonetheless, even if these structures are assured in agricultural landscapes, anuran \n\npopulations of generalist species might be under sup-optimal conditions. Telles et al. \n\n(2007) analyzed the genetic structure of P. cuvieri populations from central Cerrado and \n\nfound that anthropization explains patterns of genetic distances, even regarding recent \n\ndisturbances. The genetic distances found were higher than expected by geographic \n\ndistances. Current human population density, characteristics of habitat fragmentation and \n\nyear since the creation of each municipality are involved in the explanation of these \n\ndiscontinuities. Indeed, the southeast region of the biome, with the strongest \n\ndiscontinuities, was the first region occupied, in the 18th century.  \n\n \n\n2.4.3 Agrochemicals &amp; Diseases \n\nBesides habitat degradation and fragmentation, contamination from agrochemicals \n\nis the biggest threat to amphibians worldwide. Although Brazil is the world\u2019s largest \n\nconsumer of pesticides (Pacheco, 2009), the impacts of agricultural pesticides on local \n\namphibians have barely been explored. The most commonly used herbicides in soy and \n\nrice crops are glyphosate, phenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and endosulfan. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n\t\n\n86\t\n\nSimioni, Silva and Mott (2013) determined the toxicity (CL50) of the herbicide \n\nglyphosate on P. albonotatus and tadpole survivorship rates under sub-lethal \n\nconcentrations. Glyphosate is a systemic herbicide, considered slightly toxic to vertebrates \n\nand environmentally innocuous since it is promptly adsorbed and does not remain active in \n\nthe environment. However, some studies have indicated that glyphosate can cause negative \n\nimpacts to the biota (Langiano &amp; Martinez, 2008), including amphibians (Releya, 2005; \n\nReleya &amp; Jones, 2009). The CL50 value for P. albonotatus was four times smaller than the \n\nvalue found for a congeneric species (P. centralis) using the same protocol (Figueiredo and \n\nRodrigues, 2010). Figueiredo and Rodrigues (2010) found even higher values of CL50 for \n\ntwo other Brazilian amphibian species, the bufonid Rhinella marina and the microhylid \n\nElachistocleis sp. These discrepancies may reflect a differential resistance of anurans \n\nspecies to herbicides. Figueiredo and Rodrigues (2010) collected egg masses in puddles \n\nclose to soybean plantations, where glyphosate has been used for at least a decade. Anuran \n\nspecies with different historical contact with pesticides may develop tolerance. Species-\n\nspecific tolerances may also be due to phylogenetic factors or environmental conditions \n\nand merit further investigation, as there was also considerable variation in the response of \n\nBrazilian anuran species to sub-lethal concentrations of glyphosate. For example, P. \n\ncentralis had higher mortality rates when kept in higher sub-lethal concentrations of \n\nglyphosate. For R. marina, 50% and 75% of CL50 also affected survivorship, although for \n\nElachistocleis sp. differences in mortality among different sub-lethal concentrations were \n\nnot statistically significant (Figueiredo and Rodrigues 2010). Hence, glyphosate exposure \n\nposes different threat levels to different anuran species. However, further research is \n\nneeded to assess whether resistance is influenced by phylogenetic signature, tolerance \n\nand/or historical contact with pesticides. \n\n Moreira et al. (2012) analyzed groundwater and rainwater for pesticides and related \n\nthese data to morphological anomalies and presence of organochlorines in the blood \n\nplasma of R. schneideri and Leptodactylus labyrinthicus. Residues of endosulfan, flutriafol \n\nand atrazine were detected in the water. Endosulfan, an organochlorine insecticide, is \n\nknown be very toxic to aquatic and terrestrial organisms (Grisolia, 2005) and many studies \n\nhave confirmed its mutagenicity, teratogenicity and carcinogenicity (e.g., Gupta, Saxema \n\nand Chandra, 2000). Endosulfan residues were detected in the plasma of R. schneideri and \n\nL. labyrinthicus. Posterior analyzes detected external malformations in cane toads but not \n\n\n\nThe Anurofauna of a vanishing savana: the case of the Brazilian Cerrado \n\n87\t\n\n\t\n\nin pepper frogs. The presence of residues of endosulfan and others organochlorine \n\npesticides in anuran blood plasma may indicate impaired fitness, as atrazine is known to \n\ncause loss of larval swimming performance, adult sex changes and various anatomical \n\nanomalies. \n\n Lima (2010) performed histological analysis on liver, skin and reproductive system \n\nof Leptodactylus latrans individuals from pristine and agricultural Cerrado areas. Although \n\nboth liver and skin showed histopathologic changes, liver tissue was damaged in animals \n\nfrom pristine and agricultural areas. Two of the three studied areas where under direct \n\ninfluence of agriculture, but the first area was presumably free of pesticides, which may \n\nindicate the power that pesticide use in agricultural areas have on the surrounding habitats. \n\n Survival in agroecosystems depends upon the physiological tolerance of organisms \n\nto adapt to rapid changes in the habitat or to adopt an effective dispersal behavior (Beja \n\nand Alcazar 2003; Bambaradeniya et al. 2004; Davidson 2004). The available studies \n\nindicate that the generalists commonly found in Cerrado crops may be in sub-optimal \n\nfitness conditions due to pesticide exposure, representing an inconspicuous detrimental \n\nconsequence of agriculture for anuran populations. More studies are urgently needed in \n\norder to thoroughly assess the effects of agrochemicals on the Cerrado anurofauna. \n\n Infectious diseases in general are regarded as one of the most significant catalysts \n\ndriving global amphibian declines (Young 2004), and the emerging chytridiomycosis is a \n\nprominent cause of anuran population declines (Schloegel et al. 2010). Chytridiomycosis, \n\ncaused by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), has been detected in \n\nmore than 350 amphibian species (Skerratt et al. 2007, Lips et al. 2006, Stuart et al. 2004). \n\nThis disease has been linked to population decline in at least 200 species since 1980 \n\n(Skerratt et al. 2007). The fungus targets amphibian skin and colonizes keratinous \n\nstructures such as tadpole oral discs (Berger et al. 1998). Infections in tadpoles can affect \n\ntheir feeding, constraining growth, metamorphosis, and survival (Blaustein et al. 2005). \n\nDuring metamorphosis the skin becomes more keratinized, allowing the fungus to \n\npotentially spread to other parts of the body (Rachowicz et al. 2004, Berger et al. 2005, De \n\nPaula &amp; Cat\u00e3o-Dias 2011). In adults, the infection induces skin hyperkeratosis and slough \n\noff (Berger et al. 1998). The hyperkeratosis alters proper osmotic regulation, causing some \n\nindividuals to suffer from a hydroelectrolytic imbalance and subsequent death due to a \n\nheart attack (Voyles et al. 2009, Campbell et al. 2012).  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n\t\n\n88\t\n\n In Brazil, Bd has been recorded in species belonging to ten anuran families from \n\nthe Atlantic Forest (Becker &amp; Zamudio 2011, Carnaval et al. 2006, Grundler et al. 2012, \n\nDe Paula &amp; Cat\u00e3o-Dias 2011, Ron 2005, Schloegel et al. 2010, Toledo et al. 2006a, Toledo \n\net al. 2006b). Ramalho (2015) recorded the first case of Bd in amphibians from the Cerrado \n\nand also for species of the endemic Bokermannohyla pseudopseudis group. These species \n\noccur in small geographic ranges at high altitudes (above 900m a.s.l.), and their tadpoles \n\ndevelop in low-temperature, fast-flowing streams and rivulets (Eterovick &amp; Brand\u00e3o 2001, \n\nBrand\u00e3o et al. 2012). These traits may increase species susceptibility to chytrid infection \n\n(R\u00f6dder et al. 2009), as there are several reports of chytrid fungus causing infection of \n\nstream dwelling species (Piotrowski et al. 2004, Lips et al. 2003, La Marca et al. 2005). \n\nClimate conditions in the Cerrado seem suitable for the survival and spread of the \n\npathogen, and some models have already predicted the occurrence of Bd in the biome \n\n(Ron, 2005, Toledo et al. 2006b). Thirteen species extant in the Cerrado have been found \n\ninfected by Bd, although diagnoses were confirmed on populations from other biome. \n\nHence, more Bd studies are urgent for this biome and potentially susceptible endemic \n\nspecies from rupestrian habitats. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4.4 Cattle pastures \n\n The Cerrado is host to 42% of the national bovine herd and 67% of the biome\u2019s \n\ntotal cleared land has been used to set pastures. Native grasslands are clear-cut, burned and \n\nseeded with potentially invasive African grasses (Klink 1994) to form cattle pastures. Open \n\narea anurans are often seen as generalists with reproductive strategies adapted to harsh \n\nconditions (Haddad and Prado 2005) and some species may be resilient or even thrive in \n\npastures. However, despite being regarded as innocuous and even beneficial to amphibians \n\ngiven the seemingly mild practices and presence of waterbodies used as breeding sites, \n\nstudies on the effect of pastures on anurans are still insufficient to achieve that conclusion. \n\n Silva, Candeira and Rossa-Feres (2011) evaluated which pond characteristics \n\naffected anuran species occurrence in farmland ponds located in a pasture matrix. They \n\nfound 26 anuran species, but only Leptodactylus fuscus, E. nattereri, Pseudopaludicola \n\nfalcipes and P. cuvieri were consistently found, whereas most species were recorded in \n\n\n\nThe Anurofauna of a vanishing savana: the case of the Brazilian Cerrado \n\n89\t\n\n\t\n\nonly one or two ponds. According to this study, anuran species richness in farmland ponds \n\nis mainly predicted by marginal vegetation height and other variables related to habitat \n\nheterogeneity that reflect the structural complexity of breeding sites. The occurrence of \n\nBoana albopunctata was associated with higher aquatic vegetation heterogeneity, whereas \n\nthe occurrence of Elachistocleis cesarii was associated with a greater vegetation cover in \n\nthe pond surface. The occurrence of E. nattereri was associated with lower aquatic \n\nvegetation inside the pond, whereas the occurrence of L. podicipinus was associated with \n\ntaller marginal vegetation. Leptodactylus fuscus occurred mainly in ponds showing \n\nintermediate or permanent hydroperiods whereas P. falcipes was associated with large \n\nponds and ponds with taller aquatic vegetation.  \n\n De Marco et al. (2013) investigated local and regional patterns of species richness \n\nin the Cerrado ponds and found that amphibians were affected by environmental gradients \n\nrelated to water parameters, being positively affected by increased chlorophyll, \n\nammonium, pH, and electric conductivity and negatively affected by increased \n\ntransparency, representing mainly the trophic state of the pond. Several studies previously \n\nconducted in tropical and temperate regions have found that anuran species richness is \n\npositively correlated with the amount and/or diversity of vegetation within ponds (Burne \n\nand Griffin 2005; Lichtenberg et al. 2006; Silva et al. 2011) and in pond margins (Hazell et \n\nal. 2004; Peltzer et al. 2006). The importance of marginal vegetation height for species \n\nrichness is related to the greater diversity of microhabitats provided by different levels of \n\nvertical stratification, allowing a greater number of species to coexist. \n\n Silva, Gibbs and Rossa-Feres (2011) evaluated the effects of environmental \n\nvariables on anuran species richness and abundance in artificial temporary pools located in \n\na pasture matrix. Although they recorded 27 anuran species, only P. cuvieri and L. fuscus \n\nwere recorded in every pool, whereas most species were found in only one pool.   \n\nPools with longer hydroperiods and more aquatic vegetation supported higher species \n\nrichness. In areas with long and intense dry seasons, unpredictable rainfall and predator \n\npressure promote the use of long-term temporary habitats for amphibian reproduction. For \n\nmost species, breeding occurs during the rainy season (October to March) so it is probably \n\nmost advantageous to colonize temporary breeding pools with longer hydroperiod, where \n\nthere are few predators, than to occupy either short-hydroperiod sites, such as breeding \n\npools that may be free from predators but have high risk of desiccation, or permanent pools \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n\t\n\n90\t\n\nwith elevated numbers of predators (Wellborn et al. 1996). Aquatic vegetation was \n\nespecially important for arboreal species that vocalize perched in the vegetation. Pools \n\nwith more structural complexity may be more inviting for anuran reproduction because \n\nthey offer more sites for calling, amplexus, and oviposition, as well as shelter for recently \n\nmetamorphosed tadpoles and adults from predators (Shulse et al. 2010).  \n\n Distance from the pool to the nearest forest remnant was also determinant for some \n\nspecies, especially E. bicolor and E. nattereri, two small burrowing frogs that have low \n\ndispersal capacity (Silva and Rossa-Feres 2011). Discontinuity between suitable aquatic \n\nand terrestrial habitats, a phenomenon known as \u201chabitat split\u201d, forces many species with \n\naquatic larvae into risky breeding migrations through disturbed environments (Becker et al. \n\n2010) and may result in population extinction. Forest fragments have been identified as \n\nimportant habitats, providing refuge for many arboreal and fossorial species (Hazell et al. \n\n2001) and enhancing landscape connectivity (Becker et al. 2010). Silva et al. (2012) \n\nstudied the effect that landscape configuration had on anuran abundance and diversity in \n\nagro-savanna landscapes. The authors found that generalist species used both pasture and \n\nforest habitats and were forced to cross open habitats to reach cattle ponds to breed, despite \n\nthe inherent risks of crossing pastures (Urbina-Cardona et al. 2006). Ponds closer to \n\nfragments had higher anuran abundance and species richness than those far from or even \n\nwithin forest fragments. This study indicates that landscape configuration has an important \n\ninfluence on anuran population viability in tropical agricultural landscapes  \n\n Silva and Rossa-Feres (2011) analyzed how anuran species richness varied in \n\nwaterbodies located in a pasture matrix with increasing distance from forest fragments. \n\nThey found that the dominant species were the same regardless of the pools\u2019 distance from \n\nthe forest fragments. However, species were more abundant and showed prolonged \n\nbreeding activity in pools closer to forest fragments. Forest fragments facilitate anuran \n\nmigration from breeding, to feeding and aestivating areas (Silva &amp; Rossa-Feres 2007) and \n\nare increasingly important as altered environments may impair anuran movement (Becker \n\net al. 2007). These results reinforce the importance of forest fragments even for open area \n\nbreeders. Several temperate-zone studies recorded higher anuran richness in breeding pools \n\nnear forest fragments than those without nearby forest fragments (Herrmann et al. 2005). \n\nIn contrast to these studies, where species composition was a mix of forest-associated and \n\nopen-habitat species, the species recorded by Silva and Rossa-Feres (2011) are typical of \n\n\n\nThe Anurofauna of a vanishing savana: the case of the Brazilian Cerrado \n\n91\t\n\n\t\n\nopen areas and tolerant to anthropogenic modifications (Duellman 1999). The higher \n\ntemperature and lower soil moisture typical of open areas are known to restrict the \n\noccurrence of anurans, which experience higher rates of evaporative water loss and \n\nmortality due to desiccation or increased mortality from predators (Rothermel &amp; Semlitsch \n\n2002). Consequently, proximity of breeding pools to forested patches and more suitable \n\nmicro-climatic conditions enable some species to extend their breeding activity compared \n\nto breeding pools distant from them. These studies emphasize the importance of forest \n\nfragments and indicate that conserving these fragments is paramount for amphibian \n\ndiversity and abundance in tropical agro-savanna landscapes, even for open area breeders. \n\n \n\n2.4.5 Hydroelectric exploration \n\n River damming and the creation of large reservoirs are among the severest and \n\nmost permanent human interferences on nature (Tundisi 1996). Flooding due to a \n\nhydroelectric dam causes habitat loss and fragmentation, population isolation, and \n\nreductions in species richness, abundance, and movement patterns. The Cerrado is the \n\nbirthplace of the rivers that originate Brazil\u2019s six main watersheds (Parna\u00edba, Paran\u00e1, \n\nParaguai, Tocantins-Araguaia, S\u00e3o Francisco and Amazonas), making the biome\u2019s \n\npotential for hydroelectric dams very high.  \n\n Although this is a much unaddressed issue, Brand\u00e3o &amp; Ara\u00fajo (2008) studied \n\nchanges on anuran abundance and richness caused by habitat loss and insularization during \n\nthe flooding of the Serra da Mesa hydroelectric reservoir, in Central Brazil, created by the \n\ndamming of Tocantins river. The enormous area flooded (178,000 ha) was previously \n\ncovered by several phytophysiognomies but after complete flooding only 280 islands were \n\nformed by the isolation of hilltops. After complete flooding, only 11 of the 31 species \n\noriginally found were still recorded on the site. R. schneideri, a large, abundant, and \n\ngeneralist species, commonly found in human-modified Cerrado habitats, almost \n\ndisappeared from the islands during the following months. P. cuvieri and Rhinella \n\ngranulosa were the most abundant species on the hills before flooding but showed \n\nsignificant declines in abundance after insularization. All amphibian species that depend \n\non the availability of water bodies went extinct on the islands. Species that used gallery \n\nforests, previously present on the lowlands, went extinct as the gallery forests of the region \n\nwere submerged. Despite the fact that most species of Serra da Mesa use lentic habitats, \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n\t\n\n92\t\n\nthe number of species found at the end of the study corresponds to less than 30 percent of \n\nthe total number of species recorded in the region before dam formation.  \n\n It was expected that opportunistic species would be favored with the flooding and \n\nthe creation of a new permanent aquatic environment. However, this study shows that \n\nhydroelectric reservoirs located in the Cerrado are not used by most anurans as \n\nreproductive sites. In fact, only R. schneideri used the lake for reproduction, while other \n\ngeneralist species were not observed breeding in the lake. Besides the presence of \n\npredatory fishes, the reservoirs of hydroelectric plants lack adequate structure for \n\namphibian reproduction due to i) it\u2019s large size and lack of physical barriers, strong waves, \n\nmaking anuran activity and egg adherence to substrates difficult; ii) it\u2019s depth, leaving few \n\nsuitable places for egg laying and tadpole development, which usually occur in shallow \n\nwaters (Barreto &amp; Moreira 1996) and iii) vegetation mortality at the edges, creating a strip \n\nof dead trees and exposed soil (Diamond 1972).  \n\n \n\n2.5 Climate change and future prospects \n\n The large-scale agricultural conversion of the Cerrado has direct consequences for \n\nhabitat availability and suitability as well as other indirect and less conspicuous effects. \n\nSimulations of the effects of converting natural Cerrado into open grasslands on regional \n\nclimate have shown reduced precipitation, an increase in the frequency of dry periods \n\nwithin the wet season, changes in albedo and increased mean surface air temperature \n\n(Hoffmann and Jackson 2000). \n\n The synergy between climate change and habitat loss is perhaps the greatest threat \n\nto biodiversity (Drake et al. 2005, Canhos et al. 2008). This becomes apparent when \n\nconsidering the projected scenario of habitat degradation for 2050. If human occupation of \n\nthe Cerrado continues northward, as expected, the proportion of remaining natural habitats \n\nwill be rapidly reduced, which will lead to a great loss of biodiversity (Diniz-Filho et al. \n\n2009). In this case, only a small portion of suitable natural habitats will remain in northern \n\nCerrado, with amphibian richness being reduced to less than half. As populations are \n\nalready reduced in size by isolation due to habitat loss, increased temperature and reduced \n\nrainfall could lead to the extinction of populations and species (Bickford et al. 2010). \n\n\n\nThe Anurofauna of a vanishing savana: the case of the Brazilian Cerrado \n\n93\t\n\n\t\n\n According to Silvano (2011), future climate will not be favorable to most Cerrado \n\namphibians. Many species have restricted distributions, which increases the risks \n\nassociated to climate change, since even relatively small changes may result in a reduction \n\nof their geographic distributions (Bush and Hooghiemstra 2005). In a realistic scenario, \n\nwith a dispersal limit of 500 km around the biome, climate change should exert drastic \n\neffects on habitat suitability for amphibians. According to this author, most species will \n\nundergo more contraction than expansion of suitable areas in 2050. With an average of \n\n30% range loss, many species would be threatened with extinction. \n\n A species\u2019 ability to deal with disturbances and habitat fragmentation varies with \n\nits ecological and reproductive plasticity in the use of the altered habitats (Tocher et al. \n\n2001, Brand\u00e3o and Ara\u00fajo 2001, Urbina-Cardona et al. 2006). The ability a species has to \n\ndisperse will determine if they will occupy shifting suitable areas in the future or simply \n\ndisappear as their habitats are destroyed. Therefore, because amphibians are highly \n\ndependent on dispersal corridors in highly anthropogenic environments (Gibbs 1998), it is \n\nimportant to assure the integrity of corridors or suitable areas to their dispersion (Ara\u00fajo et \n\nal. 2006) between distant habitats. The forecasted climate changes can also impair species \n\nmigration, especially considering the speed and magnitude of their occurrence (Ara\u00fajo et \n\nal. 2006). Few amphibian species are able to disperse, within 50 years, across the 170 km. \n\nTherefore, displacement of suitable areas is an additional concern for Cerrado amphibian \n\nconservation, since southeastern Brazil is precisely the most disturbed and densely \n\npopulated areas in Brazil (Marini et al. 2009). Likewise, the current and predicted areas of \n\nhighest amphibian richness in the Cerrado coincide with densely populated areas with \n\nadvanced degrees of degradation. Diniz-Filho et al. (2009) investigated the effects of \n\nclimate change on patterns of vertebrate diversity in the Brazilian Cerrado and found that \n\nspecies distribution expansions may include areas already being used for livestock. \n\n According to Pac\u00edfico (2011), future global climatic changes will have a strong \n\nnegative effect on the anurans endemic to the Cerrado, especially those with small \n\npotential actual distribution. Anurans with small distributions will have to disperse in order \n\nto survive the alterations occurring on their native areas. Thus, the ability to disperse is \n\nparamount for the resilience of a species in a rapidly changing environment (Trakhtenbrot \n\net al. 2005). However, besides the intrinsic ability every anuran species has to disperse, \n\nthere are structural barriers (large rivers, mountains) and anthropogenic activities that \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n\t\n\n94\t\n\ncause landscape fragmentation. This synergy exacerbates the negative effects generated by \n\nthe global climatic changes, especially for small distribution species. \n\n \n\n2.6 Conclusion \n\n The world\u2019s largest and most diverse savanna is currently under major agronomic \n\npressure. Despite the scarcity of studies regarding the effects of agricultural activities on \n\nnative anurans, we were able to draw some conclusions from the main studies mentioned \n\non this review (Table 2.1).   \n\nCommonly regarded as more resilient to disturbances than their forest counterparts, \n\nthe anurofauna of the Cerrado is characterized by a series of life-history traits that may \n\neffectively render them more resistant to anthropogenic disturbances than Neotropical \n\nforest anurans. According to many studies, fossorial habits and specialized breeding \n\nstructures such as foam nests might in fact be responsible for the resistance of some \n\nanurans in disturbed Cerrado habitats such as crops and pastures. However, much like what \n\nhas been acknowledged in other biomes, these anthropogenic areas are dominated by \n\nwidespread, generalist species. Hence, crops and pastures can harbor an anuran \n\ncommunity, albeit strongly dominated by highly resilient species, favoring generalists and \n\nexcluding specialists. Nonetheless, there is evidence that these generalist populations are in \n\nsub-optimal fitness conditions.  \n\nMaintaining natural vegetation fragments, earthen irrigation channels and shallow \n\ndepressions that support perennial ponds and aquatic vegetation in order to maximize the \n\npotential of agroecosystems to harbor diverse anuran communities. \n\nThe anurofauna of the Cerrado is especially vulnerable to hydroelectric projects but \n\nthe Brazilian government has been increasingly acknowledging the hydroelectric potential \n\nof the Cerrado, planning for the construction of more hydroelectric dams in a biome \n\nalready largely converted into crops and pastures, putting the Cerrado\u2019s remaining \n\nbiodiversity in a especially precarious position.  \n\n It is urgent to direct the attention to the Brazilian savanna. The scientific \n\ncommunity must help establish the Cerrado as a valuable biome with major ecological \n\nimportance. Detailed demographic and community-level studies on Cerrado amphibians \n\nare badly needed, namely abundance and species richness studies for adult, juveniles and \n\n\n\nThe Anurofauna of a vanishing savana: the case of the Brazilian Cerrado \n\n95\t\n\n\t\n\nlarvae/eggs. Furthermore, studies approaching species loss from a functional (Tilman \n\n2001) and phylogenetic (Magurran 2005) point of view should be used as they allow a \n\nmore thorough assessment of the effects on biodiversity, analyzing the changes in \n\ncommunity composition. Invariably, as the Cerrado is transformed into the agricultural \n\nheart of Brazil, it is urgent to thoroughly assess the impacts on anuran communities, \n\nidentify eventual threatened populations and develop efficient conservation policies in \n\nconsonance with agricultural systems.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nC\nh\n\nap\nter 2 \n\n\t\n\n96\t\n\n \n\n  \n\nA\nn\n\nth\nrop\n\nogen\nic \n\nactivity \nR\n\neferen\nce \n\nB\niom\n\ne \nF\n\nocu\ns \n\nE\nffect \n\nF\nire \n\nB\nrasileiro (2004) \n\nC\nerrado \n\nC\nom\n\nm\nunity \n\n\u2022 \nSpecies\trichness\tand\tabundance\tunaffected;\t\n\n\u2022 \nHigher\tinterspecific\tcom\n\npetition\tfor\tcalling\tand\tegg-laying\tsites.\t\n\nD\nrum\n\nm\nond (2009) \n\nC\nerrado \n\nC\nom\n\nm\nunity \n\n\u2022 \nIncreased\tspecies\trichness\tafter\tthe\tfire;\t\n\n\u2022 \nIncreased\tabundance\tof\tthe\ttw\n\no\tendem\nic\tspecies\tof\tcam\n\npos\t\nrupestres;\t\n\u2022 \n\nIschnocnem\na\tjuipoca,\ttypical\tof\tfire-prone\tphytophysiognom\n\nies,\t\nw\nas\tabundant\tthroughout\tthe\tarea\tbefore\tthe\tfire,\tbut\trarely\tfound\t\n\nafterw\nards.\t\n\n\u2022 \nHigher\tfrequency\tof\tterrestrial\tspecies\tw\n\nith\thabits\tand\tbreeding\t\nspecializations\t(e.g.\tfossorial\tbehaviors;\tfoam\n\n\tnests)\tthat\trender\tthem\n\t\n\nm\nore\tresilient\tto\tfire.\t\n\n\u2022 \nNegative\teffects\ton\tthe\tarthropod-rich\tanuran\tdiet.\t\n\n\u2022 \nHigher\tinter-specific\tcom\n\npetition\tfor\tcalling\tand\tegg-laying\tsites.\t\n\nM\norais, C\n\n\u00f4rtes and \nB\n\nastos (2011) \nC\n\nerrado \nC\n\nom\nm\n\nunity \n\n\u2022 \nCo-occurrence\tpatterns,\tanuran\tspecies\tcom\n\nposition\tand\trichness\t\nw\nere\tunaffected\tby\tfire.\t\n\n\u2022 \nH\n.\talbopunctatus\tand\tS.\tfuscom\n\narginatus\tw\nere\tthe\tm\n\nost\tcom\nm\non\t\n\nspecies\tboth\tin\tburned\tand\tunburned\tveredas.\t\n\u2022 \n\nR\n.\tm\n\nirandaribeiroi\tand\tL.\tlabirynthicus\tw\nere\tfound\texclusively\tin\t\n\nburned\tand\tunburned\tveredas,\trespectively.\t\n\nC\nrop\n\ns \nS\n\nilva et al.

Abstract \n Determining species extinction risk and its drivers is a major goal for conservation \n\nbiology. The IUCN Red List is widely used for classifying extinction-risk and prioritizing \n\nconservation action. However, this system has been acknowledged as biased and \n\ncomplementary approaches are strongly recommended to achieve more reliable conclusions on \n\nconservation priorities. Species traits, often perceived as determinant for resiliency to \n\ndisturbances, have been used to identify potentially vulnerable species, even when data are \n\nscarce (e.g. Data Deficient species). We provide an integrative and cost-effective framework \n\nfor predicting species extinction-risk using data on 195 anurans from the Cerrado. We used \n\nIUCN population trend and expert-perceived vulnerability to habitat alteration as response \n\nvariables, to identify traits associated to increased extinction-risk. We used species traits, \n\nthreat pressure and geographic range to determine which species and areas had higher \n\nconservation priority. We found the official extinction-risk to be underestimated, as many \n\nspecies categorized as LC or DD are actually sensitive and/or declining. We identified \n\nbreeding site, habitat and clutch size as predictors of anuran extinction risk. We found that \n\n>70% of the biome\u2019s anurans have major protection gaps, incurring in high extinction-risk. \n\nThe southwest and central region of the biome are the main hotspots for high extinction-risk \n\n\n\nAn integrated trait-based framewok to predict extintion risk and guide conservation planing \n\n\t 127\t\n\nspecies and should be prioritized for conservation. Our framework may be particularly \n\nvaluable to assess extinction-risk and prioritize conservation action regarding less studied taxa \n\nand regions with high anthropogenic pressure, but weak government support and scarce \n\nfunding. \n\n \n\nKey Words: Cerrado, amphibians, Neotropics, Red List. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAn integrated trait-based framewok to predict extintion risk and guide conservation planing \n\n\t 128\t\n\n3.2. Introduction \n Vulnerability to disturbance differs across species and many systems have been \n\ndevised to determine extinction risk, aid in conservation planning and raise public awareness. \n\nThe most prevalent of these systems is the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (henceforth \n\n\u201cRed List\u201d), developed by the Species Survival Commission of the World Conservation Union \n\n(IUCN; http://www.iucn.org). The Red List highlights species at greater risk of extinction, \n\naiming to prioritize conservation action. The Red List classifies species based on quantitative \n\ndata on population size and geographic range (IUCN, 2001). If population size or range have \n\nbeen shown to decline, species are classified as threatened (Critically Endangered (CR), \n\nEndangered (EN) or Vulnerable (VU)). If threat criteria are not met, species are classified as \n\nnot threatened (Near Threatened (NT), Least Concern (LC)) or, when there is no sufficient \n\ndata for categorization, as Data Deficient (DD). The Red List has been paramount for \n\nestablishing protection priorities and justifying conservation funding (Baillie et al., 2008; \n\nMace and Baillie, 2007; Young et al., 2014). However, conservation status is more relative \n\nthan absolute, in the sense that a classification of CR does not imply that the species is almost \n\nextinct, but only that it is in greater danger of becoming extinct - even if by stochastic events - \n\ncompared to a species that is classified in any other category. \n\n The Red List\u2019s reliability stems from its criteria, which are objective and relatively \n\neasy to apply when adequate information is available (IUCN, 2001). These criteria were, \n\nhowever, defined based on the requirements of large vertebrate species, causing the system to \n\nbe putatively biased towards larger and easily sampled taxa (Cardoso et al., 2011; R\u00e9gnier et \n\nal., 2015; Triantis et al., 2010). Hence, even if enough information could be gathered, they \n\nmay not be appropriate for many taxa. Furthermore, decade-long re-evaluation periods may \n\nrender the Red List unable to detect shifts in extinction-risk for fast-declining species, further \n\ncompromising its effectiveness. Despite its unarguable value for conservation, the Red List \n\nshould not be used as the sole means of setting priorities for conservation measures (IUCN, \n\n2001). This recommendation is rarely appreciated and, due to the system\u2019s importance in \n\ncurrent conservation circles, its bias is often pervasive in species inventories (Cardoso et al., \n\n2011), reintroduction projects (Seddon et al., 2007), invasive species studies (Py\u0161ek et al., \n\n2008), legally protected species lists and conservation funding (Cardoso et al., 2011). \n\n\n\nAn integrated trait-based framewok to predict extintion risk and guide conservation planing \n\n\t 129\t\n\nAlthough there is a considerable degree of classification consistency, the Red List does not \n\ntake into account species life histories, causing under- or over-estimated extinction-risks in \n\ncertain cases (IUCN, 2001). Hence, threat category provides only a relative assessment of the \n\nextinction-risk under current circumstances, and should not be used in isolation. A system for \n\nassessing priorities for action should include numerous other factors concerning conservation \n\naction, such as biological characteristics of the subject, costs, logistics and chances of success \n\n(IUCN, 2001). \n\n Our understanding of which species are most at risk remains poor, especially for \n\ninconspicuous taxa, for which natural histories have not been well documented and population \n\nchanges are hard to detect (Cardoso et al., 2011). For example, according to the Red List, 32.4 \n\n% of the world\u2019s amphibians are threatened or extinct, and 24.4% are unclassified (DD), due \n\nto insufficient information (IUCN, 2008). Amphibians are among the least studied vertebrates \n\nwhen compared to birds and mammals (Hecnar, 2009), due to their inconspicuous nature and \n\nsmall size (Wells, 2007). In a highly anthropogenic world, with alarming climate change \n\npredictions and limited funding for conservation, it is vital to develop more accurate and case-\n\nspecific frameworks to prioritize conservation actions and aid mitigation. \n\n Differences in species extinction risk have been partially attributed to variation in \n\nbiological traits (Pearson et al., 2014; Van Allen et al., 2012). Indeed, habitat preferences, \n\necological traits and demographic characteristics have been successfully used to predict \n\nspecies\u2019 extinction risk (e.g. Cardillo et al., 2005; Davies et al., 2004; Lee and Jetz, 2011; \n\nPearson et al., 2014). Therefore, understanding how species traits interact to determine \n\nextinction-risk may help identify species at greater risk and prompt cost-effective and timely \n\nconservation measures. \n\n Amphibians play keystone roles in ecosystem functioning, acting as both predators and \n\nprey, and enabling nutrient transport between aquatic and terrestrial systems (Blaustein et al., \n\n2011; Wells, 2007). Furthermore, amphibians are among the most diverse and abundant \n\nvertebrates, comprising species from a variety of habits, breeding strategies and dispersal \n\nabilities (Wells, 2007). Due to their biphasic life cycle, highly permeable skin and ectothermic \n\nphysiology, amphibians are very dependent on environmental quality and vulnerable to its \n\nchange (Niemi and McDonald, 2004). Hence, amphibian extinction risk can be used as a \n\n\n\nAn integrated trait-based framewok to predict extintion risk and guide conservation planing \n\n\t 130\t\n\nsurrogate for ecosystem resilience (Davic and Welsh, 2004) and a suitable model for \n\nconceiving a new framework to informatively predict extinction risk. \n\n The Cerrado is the world\u2019s largest and most biodiverse savanna. It is also Brazil\u2019s new \n\nagricultural frontier, hosting the country\u2019s largest bovine herd and a percentage of crop area \n\nlarger than that of the Amazon. About 40% of the biome has been converted into crops and \n\npastures (Sano et al., 2010) and only 6.48% is under protection (Arruda et al., 2008; Overbeck \n\net al., 2015). The anuran assemblage of this biome has high endemicity (ca. 50%) (Valdujo et \n\nal., 2012), but low official extinction risk, as only 3 amphibians are considered threatened \n\n(IUCN, 2014, MMA, 2014), while 22% remain Data Deficient. Discrepancy between low \n\nextinction risk, high endemicity (Valdujo et al., 2012) and intense anthropogenic pressure may \n\nbe explained by historical biases towards Neotropical forest biomes, such as the Amazon or \n\nthe Atlantic Forest. For example, sixteen Atlantic Forest anurans are threatened, but a Web of \n\nScience (apps.webofknowledge.com, accessed on April 2015) search using \u2018\u2018Atlantic Forest\u2019\u2019 \n\nor \u2018\u2018Cerrado\u2019\u2019 in combination with \u201camphibians\u201d retrieved 3 times more journal articles on the \n\nAtlantic Forest than on the Cerrado. \n\n With the ever-increasing anthropogenic pressure on biomes worldwide, many species \n\nmay be unrecognizably endangered. There is a need for integrative, predictive and spatially \n\nexplicit models capable of accurately identifying species at higher risk, evaluating the \n\nconsequences of disturbances for biodiversity and guiding conservation actions, especially in \n\nbiodiverse, highly disturbed and scarcely studied regions. Herein we assess amphibian \n\nextinction risk and identify its drivers in a highly disturbed biodiversity hotspot. We propose \n\nan integrative and cost-effective method for accurately assessing and predicting extinction \n\nrisk, considering species rarity, threat pressure and trait-based vulnerability to disturbances. \n\nWe compiled an extensive database with 12 biological traits (e.g., activity, habits) and 4 \n\nvariables describing threat pressure (e.g., percentage of a species\u2019 range occupied by crops) for \n\n195 Cerrado anurans. First, to identify traits associated to increased extinction risk across \n\nspecies, we used two proxies for extinction risk as response variables: IUCN population trend \n\nand expert-perceived vulnerability to habitat alteration. This analysis allowed us then to (i) \n\npredict population decline and vulnerability to habitat alteration for every species; (ii) use our \n\nresults to calculate integrative species-specific conservation targets; (iii) perform a gap \n\n\n\nAn integrated trait-based framewok to predict extintion risk and guide conservation planing \n\n\t 131\t\n\nanalysis to evaluate how effective the network of the biome\u2019s protected areas (PA) is, and \n\nwhich are the species with more urgent conservation needs, and (iv) build maps representing \n\nareas with increased extinction-risk. \n\n \n\n3.3. Methods \n\n3.3.1. Data collection \n\n We compiled intrinsic biological traits and extrinsic environmental variables for 195 \n\nspecies of anurans extant in the Brazilian Cerrado. We used the species list from Valdujo et al. \n\n(2012) and crossed it with the IUCN distribution maps (IUCN, 2008). This data crossing \n\nmotivated us to exclude species for which we could not find satisfactory distribution maps, \n\nand include others not considered by Valdujo et al. (2012), with mapped occurrence in the \n\nCerrado. The biological traits we considered for this study were anuran activity, adult snout-\n\nvent length (SVL), geographic range size, habitat, habit, fossorial behavior, breeding site, \n\nbreeding strategy, clutch size, parental care, breeding season and breeding pattern. We also \n\nconsidered 4 variables quantifying extrinsic environmental variables, namely the percentage of \n\nrange area in Cerrado, and percentage of natural vegetation, crops and pastures within each \n\nspecies' geographic range in the Cerrado (Table A1, Supplementary material). Trait data were \n\ncompiled from the literature, AmphibiaWeb and IUCN online databases. If published data \n\nwere unavailable, we relied on expert opinion. External threats were quantified using species \n\ndistribution maps (IUCN, 2008) and a shapefile of land use in the Cerrado (e.g., agriculture, \n\nurban areas) provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Environment (MMA, 2007). We \n\ndetermined the percentage of each species\u2019 range occupied by crops, pastures and natural \n\nvegetation using program QGIS v.2.6.1 Brighton. Predictor variables were chosen based on \n\nour perception of their importance for determining species responses to anthropogenic \n\ndisturbances, and also on data availability. \n\n To identify which traits are associated with increased extinction risk across species, we \n\nused two proxies for extinction risk obtained from the IUCN Red List online database, as \n\nresponse variables. Due to the relatively low percentage of threatened amphibians (CR, VU, \n\nEN) among the 195 known from the Cerrado, we used other two variables provided by IUCN: \n\n(i) population trend, and (ii) expert-perceived vulnerability to habitat alteration. Both \n\n\n\nAn integrated trait-based framewok to predict extintion risk and guide conservation planing \n\n\t 132\t\n\npopulation trend and expert-perceived vulnerability were obtained from each species\u2019 fact \n\nsheet on the IUCN Red List database. This information is based on empirical data collected by \n\nexperts. Population trend is categorized as declining (D), stable (S), increasing (I) or unknown \n\n(U). According to this variable, 13% of the species have declining populations, 58% have \n\nstable populations and 26% have unknown population trends. Expert-perceived species \n\nvulnerability to habitat alteration was gathered from uncategorized information given by \n\nexperts based on their empirical field experience on how often a species is found in disturbed \n\nareas. We considered a species either tolerant to habitat alteration (T) if it is commonly found \n\nin disturbed areas, sensitive (S) if it tends to disappear after disturbances, or unknown (U). The \n\nIUCN online database has information on each species\u2019 vulnerability to habitat alteration for \n\nmost cases. When this was omitted we searched the literature and, if necessary, contacted the \n\nspecies assessor(s) credited on the factsheet. We contacted over 20 experts for clarifying both \n\ntrait and vulnerability uncertainties. Experts contacted were based on institutions ranging from \n\nthe states of Bahia, to Goi\u00e1s and S\u00e3o Paulo. Only when we could not get information from any \n\nof these sources, we would classify species vulnerability to habitat alteration as unknown. \n\nAccording to this variable, 23% of the anurans occurring in the Cerrado are sensitive to habitat \n\nalteration, whereas 46% are considered tolerant and 30% of the species have unknown \n\nsensitivity to habitat alteration. \n\n \n\n3.3.2. Data analysis \n\n Machine learning techniques are a powerful alternative to traditional linear models and \n\nhave documented advantages for extinction risk analyses, especially when the goal is \n\npredictive accuracy (Davidson et al., 2009; Murray et al., 2011). Classification-tree models \n\nidentify nonlinear, context-dependent associations among multiple correlated predictor \n\nvariables (Olden et al., 2008). These methods do not assume a specific distribution of \n\npredictor variables or data independence, avoiding concerns about pseudoreplication and \n\nalleviating the need for phylogenetic control (Bielby et al., 2009). \n\n To identify which traits and/or external threats were associated with increased \n\nextinction risk measured by (i) population trend and (ii) expert-perceived vulnerability to \n\nhabitat alteration, we used random forest models. This approach combines the predictions of \n\n\n\nAn integrated trait-based framewok to predict extintion risk and guide conservation planing \n\n\t 133\t\n\nmany independent decision-tree models to produce a robust classification (Breiman, 2001), \n\ndetermine predictor importance and predict vulnerability and population trend for each \n\nspecies, especially those for which information is unknown. However, because random forest \n\nmodels cannot graphically represent how each trait influences population decline and species \n\nvulnerability, we also used traditional decision-tree models for that purpose. \n\n We assessed model accuracy through the percentage of species correctly classified \n\n(PCC), the percentage of species not threatened that are correctly classified (specificity), the \n\npercentage of threatened species that are correctly classified (sensitivity), and Cohen\u2019s kappa, \n\nwhich measures inter-rater agreement for qualitative items between two classifications. \n\nCohen\u2019s kappa is considered more robust than percent agreement calculations, since it \n\naccounts for the agreement occurring by chance. We calculated Cohen's kappa statistics for \n\nagreement and further tested the null-hypothesis that the extent of agreement is random (kappa \n\nstatistic equals zero) using package irr (Gamer, 2015) on program R v.3.1.2 (R Core Team \n\n2014). We built random forest and classification-tree models using packages randomForest \n\n(Liaw and Wiener, 2015) and rpart (Therneau and Atkinson, 2012) also on program R. \n\nClassification trees are built by repeatedly partitioning the dataset into a nested series of \n\nmutually exclusive groups, each group as homogenous as possible regarding the response \n\nvariable, according to the mean decrease in accuracy (Liaw and Wiener, 2015). Branches are \n\nafterwards pruned by 10-fold cross-validation to produce an \u201coptimal tree\u201d, balancing \n\ncomplexity (i.e., number of nodes) with prediction accuracy. The smallest tree with an error \n\nrate within 1 standard error of the minimum-error tree is taken as the most parsimonious tree, \n\nthe \u201coptimal tree\u201d. \n\n Although decision-tree models do not assume data points to be independent, alleviating \n\nthe need to \u201ccorrect\u201d for phylogenetic relationships between species, we used a taxonomic \n\nvariable (family) to evaluate the role of taxonomy in population trend and expert-perceived \n\nvulnerability. \n\n To visualize how vulnerability to habitat alteration and population trend is \n\ngeographically distributed, we created heatmaps of high extinction risk zones by overlapping \n\ngeographic ranges of anuran species with traits identified as vulnerability- or decreasing-prone \n\nby our models using program QGIS v.2.6.1 Brighton. \n\n\n\nAn integrated trait-based framewok to predict extintion risk and guide conservation planing \n\n\t 134\t\n\n To evaluate the conservation efficiency of the Cerrado PA network, we performed a \n\ngap analysis. Gap analysis is a version of the well-established method of identifying gaps in \n\nthe representation of biodiversity in management areas (Scott et al., 1993). Digital map \n\noverlays are used in GIS environment to identify individual species, species-rich areas, and \n\nvegetation types that are underrepresented (Scott et al., 1993). Gap analysis is considered one \n\nof the most successful tools for detecting whether a PA system adequately protects a given \n\nspecies or assemblage, requiring: (i) an estimate of its distribution in the region, (ii) the \n\nidentification of protected sites, and (iii) the definition of explicit conservation targets \n\nnecessary to ensure acceptably small extinction risks (Pressey et al., 2003). Conservation \n\ntargets represent the minimum amount of a particular biodiversity feature (e.g., habitat type) \n\nthat should be conserved through conservation actions (Carwardine et al., 2009). The most \n\ncommonly used targets in conservation are equivalent for all species (Urbina-Cardona and \n\nFlores-Villela, 2010) or for groups of species with equivalent distributions (Catullo et al., \n\n2008; Marini et al., 2009). These can favor widespread species (Vimal et al., 2011), failing to \n\nacknowledge that some may require more extensive protection than others (Pressey et al., \n\n2003). We adopted a specific approach based on (i) species\u2019 geographic range, resulting in \n\nlarger targets for species with smaller distributions, and recognizing the increased risks that \n\nextensive impacts present for unprotected portions of their distributions (Pressey et al., 2003); \n\n(ii) susceptibility, accounting for the percentage of habitat loss and an estimate of extinction \n\nthreat, represented by species population trend and vulnerability previously predicted, and (iii) \n\nlife-history, accounting for life-history traits previously identified as determinant for \n\ndecreasing population trend or increased vulnerability: breeding site; habitat; clutch size and \n\nbody size. \n\n Geographic range (GR), susceptibility (SU) and life-history (LH) components were \n\ncalculated as shown in de Novaes e Silva et al. (2014). Species sensitive to habitat alteration \n\nare expected to have increased need for protection, to avoid high exposure to disturbances. \n\nHence, we ranked the SU component as 1 for sensitive, 0.1 for tolerant, or 1 for decreasing \n\nand 0.1 for stable. This ensured that susceptible species were attributed higher conservation \n\ntargets. For the LH component, accounting for life-history (biological traits), we used the \n\noutputs from our random forest and classification trees models to assign values and relative \n\n\n\nAn integrated trait-based framewok to predict extintion risk and guide conservation planing \n\n\t 135\t\n\nimportance to each trait and respective attribute. To input trait importance for extinction-risk \n\nand, therefore, conservation target, we used the mean accuracy decrease value. This represents \n\nthe relative importance of each predictor for vulnerability and population trend, measured by \n\nthe reduction in classification accuracy upon removal of each trait in a set of 2000 random \n\nforest trees. To input trait attribute importance, we used the results form our classification tree \n\nmodel to define which attribute was more associated to increased extinction-risk. For example, \n\nfor breeding site we used 22.5 to input trait relative importance, and attributed different values \n\naccording to association to lotic (1) or lentic (0.3) breeding sites, as association to lotic \n\nenvironments was a predictor of increased vulnerability in our classification tree models. This \n\nway, a species with lotic breeding habits will have increased conservation targets compared to \n\na pond breeding species, due to our predictions of increased extinction risk for the previous. \n\nThe other three more important traits were accordingly classified, and the values summed to \n\ndescribe species sensitivity due to life-history traits. \n\n To calculate conservation targets, we weighted the GR component twice as much as \n\nthe other two criteria, to avoid putting too much emphasis on the conservation of widespread \n\nspecies and also recognizing the prominent role of range size in determining the risk of \n\nextinction (Harnik et al., 2012). We tuned the formula so that a minimum theoretical value of \n\nabout 10% of every species\u2019 pristine range was guaranteed, a value that has been widely used \n\nas a uniform target (de Novaes e Silva et al., 2014; Pressey et al., 2003). We calculated the \n\nconservation target for each species i as: \n\n \n\n!\t# = 0.065 + 0.1+,# + 0.05-.# + 0.05/0#, \n\t\n\nwhere GR is geographic range, SU is susceptibility (population trend/vulnerability), and LH is \n\nsensitivity due to life-history traits. \n\n We conducted a global sensitivity analysis to determine the influence of uncertainty in \n\nmodel input upon the uncertainty in model output (Saltelli, 2002), generating 10,000 samples \n\nfrom the 3-dimensional parameter space (GR, SU, LH) using the Latin Hypercube Sampling \n\nand assuming a uniform distribution for each parameter, with package pse (Chalom and Prado, \n\n2014) on program R. Using maps of the Cerrado\u2019s PA network (MMA, 2007), we also \n\n\n\nAn integrated trait-based framewok to predict extintion risk and guide conservation planing \n\n\t 136\t\n\nquantified the percentage of target area currently under protection for each species, \n\nconsidering species with ? 50% of the target achieved as minor gaps and those with &lt;50% of \n\nthe target achieved as major gaps. \n\n  \n\n Our framework is composed of 3 steps, initially requiring (i) proxies for extinction-risk \n\nobtained mostly from the IUCN online database, (ii) data on 12 biological traits, (iii) \n\ndistribution maps for every species and (iv) quantification of threat pressure on each species\u2019 \n\nrange. In a second step, we analyze this data using random forest and classification tree \n\nmodels, to (i) identify traits associated to increased extinction-risk and (ii) predict population \n\ntrend and vulnerability to habitat alteration for every species, including species for which there \n\nis no information on those parameters. In the final step of the framework, we use (i) the traits \n\nassociated to increased extinction risk, (ii) species\u2019 geographic range and (iii) predicted \n\nsusceptibility (population trend and vulnerability) to calculate conservation targets and \n\nidentify high priority species and areas (Fig. 3.1). \n\n \n\n\n\nAn integrated trait-based framewok to predict extintion risk and guide conservation planing \n\n\t 137\t\n\nFigure 3.1.

Breeding site was the most important predictor of vulnerability (Fig. \n\n3.2), though total geographic range, % Cerrado range, habitat, clutch size, breeding strategy \n\nand SVL were also important (Fig. 3.3). The optimal classification tree predicted amphibian \n\nvulnerability with 79% accuracy (PCC, Cohen\u2019s kappa = 0.54, p &lt;0.001). Regarding \n\npopulation trends, classification accuracy of the random forest model was high (PCC 83.3%, \n\nCohen\u2019s kappa = 0.34, p &lt;0.001) and similar to the optimal classification-tree model. Because \n\nthe difference between the two most parsimonious trees was very small, we choose two \n\nclassification trees for graphical representation, the \u201coptimal classification tree\u201d and the \n\n\u201csecond-optimal classification tree\u201d for graphical representation.

The \n\n\u201coptimal\u201d decision tree indicated that only taxonomic family predicted population trend, \n\nalthough the \u201csecond-optimal\u201d decision tree indicated that breeding site and habitat predicted \n\npopulation trends (Fig. 3.4). Seventy percent of anurans belonging to Brachycephalidae, \n\nCentrolenidae, Ceratophryidae, Craugastoridae and Hylodidae have decreasing populations \n\n(Fig. 3.4A). Breeding site is also important for predicting decreasing population trends; 52% \n\nof stream-breeding species have decreasing populations (Fig. 3.4B). This model indicates that \n\nhabitat acts along with breeding site, resulting in 73% of the stream-breeding species from \n\nforests or rupestrian fields having decreasing populations. \n\n About 41% of the species considered sensitive to habitat modification according to the \n\ninformation gathered from the IUCN Red List online database are considered DD by IUCN, \n\n55% LC and only 3.6% are considered threatened (EN, VU or CR) (Table 1). About 77% of \n\nthe species with verified decreasing population trends are considered LC, 11% as DD and \n\n7.7% as threatened. The fact that most species considered decreasing are currently categorized \n\nas LC, suggests that the Red List may indeed be underestimating the extinction risk of the \n\nCerrado anurans. We compared vulnerability gathered from the Red List online database to the \n\nvulnerability predicted by our model and found original and predicted vulnerability to be \n\nsimilar regarding distribution along Red List statuses. About 41% of decreasing species are \n\nlisted as DD, 53% as LC and only 5.8% as threatened (Table 1). Considering every species \n\nlisted as DD, 65% are predicted as sensitive, 11% as decreasing and 17% as sensitive and \n\ndecreasing (Table A2, Supplementary material). \n\n According to our heatmaps, anurans sensitive to habitat alteration appear more densely \n\nconcentrated in the center of the Cerrado, and in other smaller and more isolated areas in the \n\nsouthwestern region (Fig. 3.5A). Likewise, decreasing species are also concentrated in the \n\ncenter of the Cerrado (Fig. 3.5B). \n\n The global sensitivity analysis revealed a null expectation of 21.7 \u00b1 2.3% for the \n\nconservation target (Ti).

According to our conservation \n\ntargets, 141 anuran species currently are major conservation gaps, i.e., the percentage of the \n\nspecies range under protection corresponds to less than 50% of its conservation targets, while \n\nonly 29 species are protected. \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAn integrated trait-based framewok to predict extintion risk and guide conservation planing \n\n\t 142\t\n\nFigure 3.4.

Discussion \n Our study demonstrates that the most vulnerable anurans in the Brazilian Cerrado are a \n\nhighly non-random subset of the assemblage regarding certain biological traits. Using two \n\nproxies for extinction risk (population trend and expert-perceived vulnerability), we were able \n\nto identify lotic breeders and habitat specialists with small clutches, large body sizes and small \n\ngeographic ranges as those associated with increased risk of extinction. \n\n The traits we found associated with increased extinction risk corroborate several other \n\nstudies regarding a wide array of taxa (Murray et al., 2011; Olden et al., 2007; Siliceo and \n\nD\u00edaz, 2010; Sodhi et al., 2008; Tomiya, 2013). Compared to generalists, specialists are \n\nconsidered less capable of dealing with new environmental challenges (e.g., habitat loss, \n\nclimate change) because they are often unable to persist outside of their narrow range of \n\npreferred conditions (Murray et al., 2011). Lotic breeding habits, habitat specialization, small \n\nclutches, large body size and small geographic range have all been acknowledged as \n\nsurrogates for higher degrees of specialization on multiple taxa (Prado and Haddad, 2005; \n\nSagot and Chaverri, 2015; Siliceo and D\u00edaz, 2010; Wells, 2007). Stream-breeding species \n\nappear particularly sensitive to habitat alteration, which is not a new finding. Stream-dwelling \n\nlarvae are highly specialized in microhabitat use for foraging and cover. Specialization can \n\nrender species susceptible to even minor environmental changes altering their ability to seek \n\ncover or forage (Welsh and Ollivier, 1998). We found that stream-breeding species with small \n\nclutches are especially sensitive to habitat alteration, which has not been previously reported. \n\nCooper et al. (2008) found that clutch size is a significant component of geographical range \n\nsize, while Hero et al. (2005) suggested that more fecund species might have greater potential \n\nto spread to new areas and occupy large geographical ranges. If larger clutches are related to \n\nlarger ranges, higher dispersal ability and colonization success in amphibians, smaller clutches \n\nmay render species more susceptible to stochastic events and anthropogenic activities, \n\nresulting in increased sensitivity to habitat alteration (Grafe et al., 2004; Pounds et al., 2006). \n\n Range size was a predictor of species vulnerability to habitat alteration, especially for \n\npond breeders. These results corroborate previous findings that small geographical range \n\ncorrelates with population decline or extinction risk in frogs (Botts et al., 2013; Sodhi et al., \n\n\n\nAn integrated trait-based framewok to predict extintion risk and guide conservation planing \n\n\t 145\t\n\n2008). Anurans with small ranges may be more vulnerable than those with larger ranges \n\nbecause they are at greater risk from activities affecting their entire range. For example, \n\nseveral endemic amphibians of Central America with narrow ranges have declined, leading to \n\nincreased IUCN Red List status (e.g. Atelopus spp.), and possibly even extinction (e.g. Incilius \n\nperiglenes). Widespread species exposed to the same threats may decline locally, but not \n\nenough throughout their range to increase their extinction risk. Furthermore, species with \n\nrestricted ranges are often specialists, which has been associated with declines in several taxa \n\n(Clavel et al., 2011) including frogs (Cooper et al., 2008). Narrow tolerance to environmental \n\nconditions makes species highly susceptible to climatic change or fluctuations (Murray and \n\nHose, 2005). \n\n Large body size has been found to correlate with population declines in mammals \n\n(Tomiya, 2013), birds (Owens and Bennett, 2000) and amphibians (Lips et al., 2003). Lips et \n\nal. (2003) suggested that body size might regulate population density. For example, large-\n\nbodied frogs would be at a disadvantage because, all else being equal, they would have a \n\nlower density than small frogs and, since population density may influence population \n\nsurvival, larger frogs might be less resilient to habitat alteration. Considering the interaction \n\nwith clutch size, species with larger body sizes but average-size clutches may not reach a \n\ndensity that ensures survival if habitat disturbances occur. \n\n Family was identified as the main predictor of decreasing population trends. Lotic \n\nbreeding habits and association with forest or rupestrian habitats were also important \n\npredictors of population decline. The 5 families with increased probability of population \n\ndecline are associated with forest habitats and/or have lotic breeding habits. While these \n\nassociations have already been explained in relation to vulnerability, the fact that taxonomy \n\nplayed the most important part in this model may be masking a bias of the scientific \n\ncommunity towards forest-associated amphibians, since this proxy was derived from \n\nquantitative data more widely available from forest species. Gonz\u00e1lez-Su\u00e1rez et al. (2012) \n\nidentified biases in the spatial distribution of data availability, especially in the diverse tropics, \n\nwhere disparity in data availability was greater among species. The authors found published \n\nstudies focused on a small group of species, often those easily sampled or more attractive. \n\nMultivariate analyses that consider several traits associated with vulnerability to extinction are \n\n\n\nAn integrated trait-based framewok to predict extintion risk and guide conservation planing \n\n\t 146\t\n\nlikely limited to a skewed subset of species that may not be representative of the whole \n\nensemble. Although this does not imply that all comparative analyses are mistaken or \n\nerroneous, it must be used to motivate more unbiased data gathering. \n\n Intrinsic traits were strong predictors of extinction risk, while variables describing \n\ndirect human impacts apparently had no effect on extinction risk. One plausible explanation \n\nfor this finding is that populations of threatened species may have already been extirpated \n\nfrom the most disturbed habitats before assessments occurred (Cardillo et al., 2005; Tingley et \n\nal., 2013). Another possibility is that detrimental effects of anthropogenic activities have \n\nbroad, across-species consequences, being detrimental to all species. In this case, variables \n\ndescribing human impacts are not identified as mediators of extinction risk because they affect \n\na wide range of species. \n\n The Red List is often used as the main tool for setting priorities for conservation \n\nmeasures. Although the system is valuable and reliable, it has its limitations, and may under- \n\nor over-estimate extinction risk for certain taxa (IUCN, 2001), rendering the category of threat \n\ninsufficient to determine conservation priorities. Other aspects, such as biological \n\ncharacteristics of the subject, should be considered during this process (IUCN, 2001). There is \n\na need for integrative, predictive and spatially-explicit frameworks capable of accurately \n\nidentifying species at higher risk, evaluating the consequences of disturbances for biodiversity \n\nand guiding conservation actions, especially in biodiverse, highly disturbed and scarcely \n\nstudied regions. \n\n Our study suggests that the extinction risk of amphibians worldwide may be severely \n\nunderestimated, especially in scarcely studied and highly anthropogenic biomes. We found \n\nthat a large proportion of species predicted as sensitive and/or decreasing is currently listed as \n\nLC or DD by the Red List. This corroborates previous studies regarding other taxa; smaller, \n\nunpopular and inconspicuous species may be severely unacknowledged by the world\u2019s leading \n\nextinction risk classification system, despite their often pivotal importance for ecosystem \n\nfunctioning. Bland et al. (2014) found that 64% of the world\u2019s mammals categorized as DD \n\nwere actually predicted as threatened and Butchart and Bird (2010) and Morais et al. (2013) \n\nunderscored the urgency to consider DD species as priorities for studies. In fact, DD \n\namphibians are likely to be more threatened with extinction than their fully assessed \n\n\n\nAn integrated trait-based framewok to predict extintion risk and guide conservation planing \n\n\t 147\t\n\ncounterparts (Howard and Bickford, 2014). Given their importance for ecosystem functioning \n\nand the intrinsic difficulties in studying amphibians, predictive integrative trait-based analyses \n\nmay give us insight into impending declines and prioritize regions for scientific projects or \n\nconservation actions. \n\n About 70% of the species analyzed are major conservation gaps, while only 29 species \n\nare sufficiently protected. The center of the Cerrado is the biome\u2019s main hotspot for high \n\nextinction-risk anurans, which may be partially explained by the high concentration of narrow \n\nendemics in mountainous regions, such as Serra do Cip\u00f3 (e.g., Bokermannohyla saxicola and \n\nHypsiboas cipoensis), Serra do Cabral (e.g., Scinax cabralensis), Serra da Canastra (e.g., \n\nBokermannohyla ibitiguara and Scinax maracaya), Chapada dos Veadeiros (e.g., Hypsiboas \n\nericae and Leptodactylus tapiti), and Chapada dos Guimar\u00e3es (e.g., Phyllomedusa centralis, \n\nPristimantis crepitans) (Valdujo et al., 2012). A further explanation may be the historical \n\nhuman occupation of that region, coupled with the inadequacy of the local PA network. We \n\nconclude that the extinction risk of the Cerrado anurans appears severely underestimated, and \n\nthe current PA network is insufficient to protect at least 50% of the minimum area required for \n\nensuring the protection of 141 species. Bokermannohyla ibitiguara, Bokermannohyla \n\nizecksohni, Elachistocleis bumbameuboi, Hypsiboas ericae, Pristimantis crepitans, \n\nProceratophrys moratoi, Phyllomedusa oreades, Rhinella scitula, and Scinax cabralensis have \n\nespecially high conservation needs, and&lt;10% of their conservation target achieved. These \n\nspecies are concentrated mainly in the southwest and central regions of the biome. Hence, we \n\nrecommend that these species and regions in particular be prioritized for conservation actions \n\nin the Cerrado. \n\n Our results provide novel insights into factors that lead to a high risk of extinction in \n\nanurans, highlighting the usefulness of an integrative framework for making predictions \n\nregarding the likelihood of future population declines. This study underscores the urgency of \n\ntaking more specific and integrative approaches, considering species ecology and landscape \n\nmetrics with powerful quantitative tools to unveil the patterns that lead to extinction, and use \n\nthose results to guide conservation and management policies. The cost-effective approach we \n\npresent may be of special value for biodiverse regions, with strong anthropogenic pressure, but \n\nweak government support and scarce funding for conservation actions. Brazil is currently \n\n\n\nAn integrated trait-based framewok to predict extintion risk and guide conservation planing \n\n\t 148\t\n\nexperiencing extremely high economic demands, and after long decades of raising public \n\nawareness to the importance of protecting the Amazon rainforest, other biomes have been \n\ntargeted to fulfill the high social and economic exigencies (Allan, 2003). Non-forest biomes, \n\nsuch as the Cerrado, have been neglected, even though they cover large parts of the country \n\nand have biodiversity levels comparable to forests (Overbeck et al., 2015). To avoid losing \n\nmuch of its biodiversity and ecosystem services, conservation and sustainable land use \n\npolicies in Brazil need to be extended to non-forest biomes, encompassing the creation of new \n\nlarge protected areas, the reinforcement of legal restrictions of land use; extension of subsidy \n\nprograms and governance commitments to non-forest biomes; and the improvement of \n\necosystem monitoring, management and sustainable use in non-forest biomes (Overbeck et al., \n\n2015). Indeed, if Brazil manages to extend its conservation successes to non-forest biomes, it \n\nnot only would contribute significantly to conservation of its biodiversity, but also could take \n\nthe lead in conservation of non-forest biomes worldwide. Frameworks such as ours may shed \n\nlight into which areas and species need more protection and what is the minimum protection \n\neach species needs to endure. These practical approaches may be vital in prioritizing \n\nconservation actions in the most neglected non-forest biomes. However, these efforts should \n\nbe accompanied by substantial increases in coordinated research on the long-term monitoring \n\nof amphibian populations and collection of life history and ecological data to further \n\nunderstand species declines and mitigate current threats. \n\n \n\n3.6. Conclusion \n The extinction risk of certain taxa and biomes is possibly underestimated worldwide. \n\nThis may be especially dangerous for highly sensitive taxa from highly diverse but \n\nanthropogenic regions. Although the value of the Red List is unquestionable, its generalist \n\ncharacter requires the use of other complementary approaches to accurately assess and predict \n\nextinction risk, to prioritize conservation actions. The Red List very clearly warns of the \n\nsystem\u2019s limitations, stating that it should not be used as the sole instrument for approaching \n\nconservation prioritization. Our study shows that adopting an integrative specific approach to \n\nevaluate extinction risk, using species traits in association with threat exposure, may be an \n\naccurate and cost-effective framework. We do not intend to suggest transformations to the Red \n\n\n\nAn integrated trait-based framewok to predict extintion risk and guide conservation planing \n\n\t 149\t\n\nList, but rather motivate the use of holistic, informed and more specific approaches, that \n\ncapitalize the Red List\u2019s value and ensure successful outcomes, especially for biodiversity \n\nhotspots. Planning and implementing conservation actions takes large amounts of time, effort \n\nand funding. The framework we presented may be particularly valuable to prioritizing \n\nconservation actions in biomes with important conservation value, high human pressure and \n\nlow funding. \n\n \n\n3.7.

Abstract \n Agricultural expansion is a major driver of biodiversity loss, especially in the \n\nmegadiverse tropics. Rice is the world\u2019s most important food crop, but the effects of \n\nhabitat conversion to rice crops on biodiversity have not been consensual. Nonetheless, \n\ngiven its nature, location and extension worldwide, irrigated rice fields are invariably used \n\nby the native fauna. Here we conduct an integrative evaluation of the effects habitat \n\nconversion to irrigated rice crops has on anuran communities in a Cerrado-Amazon \n\necotone. We found that habitat conversion and agricultural management caused profound \n\nalterations to the anuran community, namely dramatic loss of species diversity and \n\nfunctional richness with increased functional divergence. Community composition was \n\naltered, with dominance by generalist and low representation of specialist. Anuran \n\ncommunities in rice fields exhibited decreased phylogenetic diversity and mean \n\nphylogenetic distance, with increased mean nearest phylogenetic distance. Agricultural \n\ncommunities are composed of phylogenetically related species. Nonetheless, taxonomic \n\ndiversity did not vary significantly, suggesting that it should not be used without \n\ncomplementary metrics. We found small geographic ranges, habitat specialization, small \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n\t 178\t\n\nclutches and large body size to be associated with low species abundances in rice fields. \n\nFrogs from crops exhibited lower body condition across guilds, indicating reduced fitness \n\nand suggesting that reproductive output and survival may be impaired in these \n\ncommunities. Understanding how communities are altered by human activities will allow \n\nbetter predictions of the functional effects of anthropogenic land-use. Maintaining high \n\nlevels of diversity in anthropogenic environments is important for ecosystem resilience \n\nbecause diverse communities are more likely to hold multiple species capable of \n\ncontributing to a single ecological function. Conversion of Neotropical natural vegetation \n\nto vast irrigated rice crops results in the extinction of large subsets of species irrespective \n\nof their specialization, with even the more resilient generalists exhibiting lower body \n\ncondition. Neotropical rice crops appear unable to support functionally and \n\nphylogenetically diverse, healthy communities, contributing to lower ecosystem resilience \n\nand dramatic implications for global ecology, economy and public health. \n\n \nKeywords: Neotropics, Amphibians, Agriculture, Functional diversity, Phylogenetic \ndiversity. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nEvidence of anuran community disruption on rice crops: a multidimensional evaluation \n\n\t\n\n\t 179\t\n\n4.2. Introduction \n Deforestation is a major driver of biodiversity loss, especially in the megadiverse \n\nNeotropics, where it is mainly caused by agricultural expansion (Garc\u00eda-Barrios et al., \n\n2009). Agriculture and cattle farming are known to cause extensive and complex \n\nalterations to communities and ecosystems (Frishkoff et al., 2014; Williams-Guill\u00e9n and \n\nPerfecto, 2010). For example, several studies have reported negative effects of habitat \n\nconversion to irrigated rice crops on biodiversity (e.g. Attademo et al. 2011; Hyne et al. \n\n2009; Maximiliano Attademo et al. 2015). However, these agricultural wetlands have also \n\nbeen considered valuable for birds and amphibians (Bambaradeniya and Amarasinghe, \n\n2004; Czech and Parsons, 2002; Elphick and Oring, 2003; Lep\u0161 et al., 2006) and even \n\nfunctional equivalents to natural wetlands.  \n\n Wetlands are important breeding habitats for many amphibian species and irrigated \n\nrice fields are invariably used by local amphibians to forage and reproduce. Due to their \n\nbiphasic life cycle, highly permeable skin and ectothermic physiology, amphibians are \n\nvery dependent on environmental quality and vulnerable to its change (Niemi and \n\nMcDonald, 2004). They play keystone roles in ecosystem functioning, acting as both \n\npredators and prey, enable nutrient transport between aquatic and terrestrial systems and \n\nare among the most diverse and abundant vertebrates, especially in the Neotropics. \n\nAmphibians can hence be used as reliable surrogates to evaluate the effects of human \n\ndisturbances on whole communities and ecosystems (Davic and Welsh, 2004). \n\n Rice is the world\u2019s most important food crop, occupying 11% of the world\u2019s total \n\narable land (Guimar\u00e3es, 2009). Asian countries are responsible for 90% of the world\u2019s rice \n\nproduction, while Latin America and the Caribbean produce 4.1%, half of which comes \n\nsolely from Brazil (FAO, 2011). Given the extension and location of rice fields worldwide, \n\ndetermining if these agricultural wetlands can function adequately to maintain biodiverse \n\nand healthy communities is of the utmost concern. This takes special significance in the \n\nNeotropics, where rice production meets important social and economic demands and \n\nbiodiversity is especially high and unique.  \n\n The effects of anthropogenic landscape modification are complex, often involving \n\nthe rise of new environmental, compositional and configurational conditions that affect \n\nbiodiversity. This concept, defined as environmental filtering, suggests that the \n\nenvironment acts as a filter, favoring certain species with particular traits over others \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n\t 180\t\n\n(Keddy 1992; Weiher &amp; Keddy 1995; Mayfield et al. 2005; Lebrija-Trejos et al. 2010). \n\nThe environmental filters arisen as a consequence of disturbances often favor generalist \n\nspecies while creating communities with species richness similar and even higher to that of \n\npristine environments. General patterns of environmental filtering have been identified for \n\nbirds, plants, and freshwater organisms. Traits such as body size, leaf area and geographic \n\nrange have been identified as determinant for species resiliency to disturbances \n\n(Lindenmayer &amp; Montague-Drake 2008, McIntyre 2008, Poff 1997). Environmental \n\nfiltering may hold great promise as a predictive framework to assist conservation planning \n\nand management of anthropogenic environments directed at favoring species with \n\nparticular traits associated with decreased resilience (Hanspach, 2012).  \n\n Species richness metrics rely on the erroneous assumption that all species are equal, \n\ni.e., only relative abundances establish the relative importance of species in communities \n\nand ecosystems (Magurran, 2004). In fact, some species carry more evolutionary history or \n\nfunctional traits essential to ecosystem processes than others (Cadotte et al., 2010; \n\nMouillot et al., 2013a). Nonetheless, most studies addressing community assembly in \n\nhuman-modified landscapes rely on simplistic taxonomic metrics (Sodhi and Ehrlich, \n\n2010) and leave important ecosystem-level consequences unaddressed. Because the \n\ncomplex effects of environmental variation induced by human activities on species is \n\nultimately mediated by specific characteristics (e.g. physiological constraints, habitat \n\nrequirements, dispersal abilities), considering only taxonomic metrics may fail to provide \n\naccurate conclusions on the real consequences of anthropization on biodiversity. To attain \n\nmore representative conclusions on the effects human activities have on communities, we \n\nmust go beyond species number and account for different components of biodiversity.  \n\n Functional (FD) and phylogenetic diversity (PD) are estimates of biodiversity \n\nbased on ecological functions and evolutionary histories of species, respectively. FD \n\ndescribes the variability in ecological attributes among species and expresses ecosystem \n\nresistance, resilience and functioning (Petchey and Gaston, 2006). FD can be divided into \n\nthree primary components \u2013 functional richness (FRic), functional divergence (FDiv) and \n\nfunctional evenness (FEve). FRic represents the amount of functional space occupied by a \n\nspecies assemblage. FEve corresponds to how regularly species abundances are distributed \n\nin the functional space. Finally, FDiv defines how far high species abundances are from \n\nthe center of the functional space. These facets are complementary and jointly describe the \n\n\n\nEvidence of anuran community disruption on rice crops: a multidimensional evaluation \n\n\t\n\n\t 181\t\n\ndistribution of species and their abundances within the functional space. PD measures the \n\nevolutionary differences among species based on times since divergence from a common \n\nancestor (Faith, 1992), representing an estimate of phylogenetically conserved ecological \n\nand phenotypic differences among species (Cavender-Bares et al. 2009). This dimension \n\nmay characterize the long-term evolutionary potential of specific clades to respond or \n\nadapt to current and future environments. Few studies have explored the influences of \n\nanthropogenic landscapes on FD or PD (Tscharntke et al., 2012), and most of which have \n\nfocused on plant and invertebrate assemblages (e.g., Arroyo-Rodr\u00edguez et al. 2012; Aviron \n\net al. 2005; Laliberte et al. 2010). \n\n Other metrics have been proposed to assess the effects of anthropogenic \n\ndisturbance on communities. Body condition is considered an indicator of environmental \n\nstress, prey availability and/or habitat quality (Sztatecsny and Schabetsberger, 2005), \n\nreproductive investment (Castellano et al., 2004), parasite load, investment in secondary \n\nsexual characters (Green, 2001), mate choice (Uetz et al., 2002), survival (Hoey and \n\nMcCormick, 2004), vulnerability to predation (Murray, 2002), and/or fighting ability (Bee \n\net al., 2000). Body condition is thus a proxy of energy reserves (Schulte-Hostedde et al., \n\n2005) and may be used to assess the effects of environmental disturbances on the \n\nindividual fitness level. \n\n Here we conduct an integrative evaluation of the effects that habitat conversion to \n\nrice fields has on anuran communities in a Cerrado-Amazon ecotone. This region has three \n\nlarge rivers, Araguaia, Formoso and Java\u00e9s, hosting the world\u2019s largest continuous area of \n\nirrigated rice, with over 500.000 ha. As an ecotone, it has unique biodiversity, resulting \n\nfrom constant and historical direct contact between species typical of the Cerrado and the \n\nAmazon biomes. We adopted a multidimensional approach to assess i) how taxonomic \n\ndiversity, species richness and evenness are modified; ii) how functional and phylogenetic \n\ndiversity are affected; iii) which anuran traits are selected and excluded in Neotropical \n\nagricultural landscapes; and iv) use body condition indices to assess if population fitness is \n\nunaltered by agricultural activities. We expect that indices considering functional and \n\nphylogenetic diversity will provide better evaluations of habitat degradation than indices \n\nbased on species taxonomic identity and abundances, since species\u2013environment \n\nrelationships are assumed to be mediated via functional traits (e.g., Suding et al. 2008). \n\nFurthermore, we expect rice fields to pose different environmental filters on anuran \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n\t 182\t\n\ncommunities, resulting in more homogeneous communities, with marked selection for \n\ncertain traits that ensure persistence on these altered landscapes. Finally, we hypothesize \n\nthat, although generalist species are apparently successful in these environments, body \n\ncondition indices will be lower than in pristine areas, which may indicate that agricultural \n\nenvironments are unable to host healthy generalist anuran communities. This is the first \n\nstudy to simultaneously assess taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic dimensions of \n\nanuran communities, along with body condition, within a human-modified landscape in the \n\nNeotropics.\n\n\n\nEvidence of anuran community disruption on rice crops: a multidimensional evaluation \n\n\t\n\n\t 183\t\n\n \n\n4.3. Methods \n4.3.1. Study area \n\n This study took place in the states of Goi\u00e1s and Tocantins, Brazil. Both pristine and \n\nagricultural study areas are inserted in an ecotone region between the Amazon rainforest and \n\nthe Brazilian savanna, the Cerrado. \n\n Depending on topography, soil type and condition, temperature, pluviometry and \n\navailable technology, there are five types of rice fields in Brazil. Irrigated and upland rice \n\nfields are the most expressive regarding crop area and yield, accounting for 67% and 37% of \n\nthe annual production, respectively (IBGE, 2005). While upland rice fields are distributed \n\nalong the biome, on montane areas, irrigated rice is grown in periodically flooded regions, \n\nusually close to large rivers. Considered Brazil\u2019s \u201cwater tank\u201d, with its extensive periodically \n\nflooded areas, high water availability and suitable climatic and territorial extension, the \n\nCerrado has great agricultural potential for irrigated rice production (Santos and Rabelo, \n\n2004).  \n\n Sampled rice fields are located in the municipal district of Lagoa da Confus\u00e3o \n\n(Tocantins). Pristine areas are located in Pium, Ilha do Bananal (Tocantins) and Monte Alto \n\n(Goi\u00e1s). The region is a seasonally flooded area, with two large rivers, Formoso and Java\u00e9s, \n\nand a very pronounced rainy season from October to April. This highly unique ecotone is \n\noften characterized by the presence of ipucas, \u201cislands\u201d of closed native vegetation that remain \n\nflooded longer than the surrounding areas. Recently, an endemic rodent (Rhipidomys \n\nipukensis) was found within these structures (Rocha et al., 2011). When an ipuca is destroyed \n\nto make place for crops, low crop yields often result because when the native vegetation is \n\nremoved, the ipuca area remains flooded for longer, thus becoming useless for agriculture. \n\nThe ipucas exist only in the state of Tocantins, making the agricultural landscapes of this state \n\nquite peculiar, with vast crop areas speckled by many \u201cislands\u201d of native vegetation of \n\nvariable dimensions. \n\n Irrigated rice fields in the Cerrado-Amazon ecotone present a dynamic hydrologic \n\nregime, with variation between aquatic and terrestrial phases. When rice is being produced, \n\nfrom December to April, rice fields have surface water until harvest, before which crops are \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n\t 184\t\n\ncompletely drained (Santos and Rabelo, 2004). After rice harvesting, fields may remain \n\nwithout crops, or other crops, such as soybeans or watermelons, may be grown, depending on \n\nthe landowner\u2019s will. Besides rice fields, the region\u2019s landscape is also occupied by pasture \n\nareas, where cattle, emus or water buffalos roam. \n\n Sampled pristine areas are characterized by natural vegetation typical of Cerrado-\n\nAmazon ecotone, with no significant anthropogenic activities. \n\n \n4.3.2. Sampling design \n\n To ensure we represented most of the environmental variability of this agricultural \n\nlandscape, we chose a total of 10 rice fields along the Rio Formoso irrigation project (Fig. \n\n4.1). Chosen rice fields varied in size, ipuca abundance and dimensions and waterbody \n\nabundance and size. We selected 4 to 5 lentic waterbodies for anuran sampling in each rice \n\nfield, totaling 35 waterbodies sampled in rice fields. All waterbodies were located inside the \n\nagricultural matrix or less than 50 m from rice fields. Waterbodies for the pristine and \n\nagricultural area were chosen based on type, size and hydroperiod. We chose small (25 m2) to \n\nlarge (1200 m2) temporary lentic waterbodies. All sampled waterbodies were at least 450 m \n\napart (Fig. 4.1).  \n\n \n4.3.3. Anuran surveys \n\nAgricultural and pristine area surveys were conducted during two rainy seasons, from \n\nFebruary 2013 to April 2014. Anuran sampling was performed using nocturnal visual \n\nencounter surveys along a 10 m wide margin of each waterbody, for approximately 30 min. \n\nEvery individual seen perched on the vegetation, on the ground, under the leaf litter, logs or \n\nstones was caught, identified, measured, weighed, photographed and then released near the \n\nsite of origin.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nEvidence of anuran community disruption on rice crops: a multidimensional evaluation \n\n\t\n\n\t 185\t\n\n4.3.4. Trait Data \n\nWe compiled life history and ecological traits for every anuran species encountered in the \n\nagricultural and pristine study areas. For each species we compiled information on 12 traits: \n\nactivity, habits, habitat, fossorial behavior, adult snout-vent length (SVL), breeding site, \n\nbreeding strategy, clutch size, parental care, breeding season, breeding pattern and geographic \n\nrange size. Traits were chosen based on perceived importance for determining species \n\nresilience to agricultural activities (Table A1) and on data availability. Trait data were \n\nFigure 4.1. Study area (A).

If published data \n\nwere unavailable, we relied on expert opinion or inferred trait information based on closely \n\nrelated species. \n\n \n\n \n4.4. Data analysis \n\n4.4.1. Sampling efficiency and species richness \n\nTo assess the effectiveness of our sampling effort, we fitted species accumulation curves \n\nfor the agricultural and pristine areas. We calculated observed species richness, estimated \n\nspecies richness (Chao1 estimator), species diversity (Shannon\u2013Weaver's H) and species \n\nevenness (Pielou\u2019s J) for the agricultural and pristine areas, for every site sampled in both \n\nareas, using the Vegan package (Oksanen et al., 2010) in program R version 3.1.2 (Team, \n\n2013). \n\n \n\n4.4.2. Taxonomic Diversity \n\nWe calculated taxonomic diversity (D) and taxonomic distinctness (D*) (Clarke and \n\nWarwick 2001) based on information derived from a hierarchical taxonomic tree. We used \n\ntaxonomic classification of all species sampled in both agricultural and pristine areas. \n\nTaxonomic indices were calculated using package vegan (Oksanen et al., 2010) on program R \n\nversion 3.1.2 (Team, 2013). \n\n \n\n4.4.3. Functional diversity \n\nMason et al. (2005) divided functional diversity into three independent components: the \n\namount of trait space filled by the community (FRic), the divergence of abundance distribution \n\nin the occupied trait space (FDiv) and the evenness of distribution of abundance in trait space \n\n(FEve). We quantified functional richness (FRic) according to Vill\u00e9ger, Mason, and Mouillot \n\n(2008), which corresponds to the volume inside the hull that contains all trait combinations \n\nrepresented in the community. FRic is only influenced by the identity of species and more \n\nparticularly by the most extreme species (in terms of functional traits), which delimitate the \n\nconvex hull. We quantified functional evenness and functional divergence with FEve and \n\n\n\nEvidence of anuran community disruption on rice crops: a multidimensional evaluation \n\n\t\n\n\t 187\t\n\nFDiv, proposed by Vill\u00e9ger et.al. (2008). FEve includes both the regularity of species \n\ndistribution and the regularity of their abundances along the \u201cskeleton\u201d of the functional \n\nvolume occupied. It decreases when functional distances among species are less even or when \n\nabundances are less evenly distributed among species, i.e. when the main abundances belong \n\nto functionally close species. FDiv, the third facet of functional diversity, describes whether \n\nhigher abundances are close to the volume borders. It approaches zero when highly abundant \n\nspecies are very close to the center of gravity of the volume occupied and approaches unity \n\nwhen highly abundant species are very distant from the center of gravity. FDis is the mean \n\ndistance in multidimensional trait space of individual species to the centroid of all species \n\nbeing unaffected by species richness by construction (Lalibert\u00e9 et al., 2010). We also \n\ncomputed functional group richness (FGR), which returns the number of functional groups per \n\ncommunity, as well as the abundance of each group in each community. \n\n All of the abovementioned components of functional diversity were computed for both \n\nareas, based on trait values and relative abundances of species. To assess differences among \n\nindices from agricultural and pristine areas, we used t-tests or Wilcoxon\u2013Mann\u2013Whitney tests \n\nfor non-parametric data. All FD indices were calculated using packages FD (Lalibert\u00e9 et al., \n\n2015), Ape (Paradis et al., 2004) and Picante (Kembel et al., 2010) in R version 3.1.2 (Team, \n\n2013). \n\n \n\n4.4.4. Null model validation \n\n Most changes in FD components cannot be interpreted directly, since communities \n\ndiffer in species richness. Thus, we must assess not if observed diversity indices are \n\nsignificantly different between the agricultural and pristine areas, but if diversity indices are \n\nsignificantly different between agricultural and pristine areas after randomizing the samples \n\nbetween the areas. We tested the null hypothesis of no change in pristine and agricultural \n\ncommunities, designing an appropriate randomization procedure to test community changes in \n\ndiversity indices (Swenson, 2014). Our null models were independent swap models, which \n\nrandomize community data, while maintaining species occurrence frequency and sampling \n\nspecies richness for each community. The randomization process was carried out 999 times for \n\neach index and area and the P-value associated with the null hypothesis (no community effect) \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n\t 188\t\n\nrejection was estimated (Manly, 2007). We tested whether the actual FD for each community \n\nwas significantly higher or lower than the null FD distribution, at ? = 0.05. This approach \n\nallowed us to determine if changes in FD simply reflected species richness, or if species \n\ncomposition and trait diversity varied in important ways between agricultural and pristine \n\nareas. In addition, a standardized effect size (SES) was calculated for each index and each area \n\nto measure the statistical amount of deviation of the observed index of community structure \n\nfrom the distribution of simulated indices (Gotelli and McCabe, 2002). Null models and \n\nrespective significance metrics were generated on program R version 3.1.2. \n\n \n4.4.5. Phylogenetic Diversity \n\n We used the phylogenetic tree built by Isaac et al. (2012) from the amphibian \u2018tree of \n\nlife\u2019 described by Faivovich et al. (2006), with 5713 amphibian species and respective branch \n\nlengths. We pruned this supertree to build a smaller phylogenetic tree with every species \n\nsampled in the pristine and agricultural areas. All operations related to pruning the original \n\nIsaac et al. (2012) supertree were performed on R v. 3.1.2 using package Ape (Paradis et al., \n\n2004). We quantified the phylogenetic diversity (PD) with three different measures: Faith\u2019s \n\nindex of PD (PDf, Faith 1992), mean phylogenetic distance (MPD) and mean nearest \n\nphylogenetic taxon distance (MNTD) (Webb et al., 2002). Faith\u2019s index of phylogenetic \n\ndiversity is defined as the minimum total length of the phylogenetic branches connecting the \n\nspecies together on the phylogenetic tree. The abundance-weighted measures MPD and \n\nMNTD are respectively the average distance between two random individuals in a sample and \n\nthe average distance to the closest heterospecific individual for all individuals in the sample \n\n(Webb et al., 2008). The branch lengths on the phylogram were used as distance measures. \n\nMPD is a measure of the tree-wide phylogenetic relatedness of the community, while MNTD \n\nfocuses more on the relationships between the tips of the phylogenetic tree (Kraft et al., 2007). \n\nMeasures of PD were calculated in R version 3.1.2 with the Picante package (Kembel et al., \n\n2010). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nEvidence of anuran community disruption on rice crops: a multidimensional evaluation \n\n\t\n\n\t 189\t\n\n4.4.6. Anuran trait association with agricultural landscapes \n\n To identify which traits persisted or were lost with land use, we used machine learning \n\ntechniques to build classification and regression trees (CART). Although these tools have been \n\npreviously used in ecology and recommended for conservation practice and wildlife \n\nmanagement (Oliver et al., 2012), their application is still limited (Olden et al., 2008). \n\nDecision and regression trees are designed to identify nonlinear, context-dependent \n\nrelationships between multiple correlated predictor variables (Olden et al., 2008). They do not \n\nassume a specific distribution of predictor variables or data independence, avoiding potential \n\nconcerns about pseudoreplication and alleviating the need for explicit phylogenetic control \n\n(Bielby et al., 2009). Predictor variables may appear repeatedly in the model as necessary, a \n\nfundamental difference from the single-predictor variables of linear models. Finally, these \n\nanalyses produce graphical outputs that quantify and summarize the interactions in a visual, \n\neasily interpretable format. \n\n Because traditional tree models can be unstable, we used random forest, which \n\ncombines the predictions of many independent decision-tree models to produce robust results \n\nregarding variable importance (Breiman, 2001). However, because random forest models do \n\nnot produce a visual representation of variable importance, we also fitted traditional \n\nclassification and regression tree models. We used packages randomForest (Liaw and Wiener, \n\n2015) and rpart (Therneau and Atkinson, 1997) of program R v. 3.1.2 to determine the main \n\npredictors of anuran presence and species relative abundance in rice fields. Trees are built by \n\nrepeatedly partitioning the dataset into a nested series of mutually exclusive groups, each \n\ngroup as homogenous as possible regarding the response variable. Homogeneity is measured \n\nby the Gini index. Branches or split points in the tree are determined by considering all \n\npossible splits of all predictor variables and selecting the split that results in the most \n\nhomogenous subgroups for the data. The branching process continues until further subdivision \n\nno longer reduces the Gini index. Lower branches are afterwards pruned by 10-fold cross-\n\nvalidation to produce an optimal tree, balancing complexity (i.e., number of nodes) with \n\nprediction accuracy. The smallest tree with an error rate within 1 standard error of the \n\nminimum-error tree is taken as the optimal tree. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n\t 190\t\n\n We quantified overall model accuracy using the percentage of species correctly \n\nclassified (PCC), specificity (percentage of species not present correctly classified), and \n\nsensitivity (percentage of species present correctly classified). We assessed the accuracy of the \n\nrelative abundance model using cross-validation from package rpart in program R.  \n\n \n\n4.4.7. Body condition index \n\n The original method of estimating body condition involved the quantification of fat \n\ndeposits and was fatal for the studied individuals (Blackwell, 2002). A non-destructive \n\nalternative to the above-mentioned method is the use of body condition indices (BCI) based on \n\nallometric relationships between length and weight. We extracted body condition indices from \n\nthe residuals of the regression of log(body mass) on log(snout\u2013vent length) (Jakob et al., 1996; \n\nPeig and Green, 2010). To evaluate how body condition varied between pristine and crop \n\nareas and across guilds, we calculated body condition indices for two treefrog genera \n\n(Dendropsophus and Hypsiboas) and for a terrestrial genus (Leptodactylus). Hypsiboas \n\nrepresents larger treefrogs while Dendropsophus represents smaller treefrogs. Samples \n\nconsisted of 241 individuals of Dendropsophus, 161 Hypsiboas and 657 Leptodactylus. Half \n\nof the datasets corresponded to individuals from pristine areas, and the other half to \n\nindividuals sampled in rice fields. \n\n\n\nEvidence of anuran community disruption on rice crops: a multidimensional evaluation \n\n\t\n\n\t 191\t\n\n \n4.5.

Discussion \n Our study is the first to integratively represent the effects of natural habitat conversion \n\nto rice fields on anuran communities. Habitat conversion and agricultural management have \n\ncaused profound alterations to the anuran community, including dramatic loss of species \n\ndiversity and functional richness and increased functional divergence. Community \n\ncomposition suffered severe alterations, resulting in dominance of generalist hylids and \n\nleptodactylids and low representation of specialist microhylids and bufonids. Anuran \n\ncommunities in rice fields exhibited decreased phylogenetic diversity and mean phylogenetic \n\ndistance, and increased mean nearest phylogenetic distance, suggesting that anuran \n\ncommunities in agricultural areas are composed of phylogenetically related species and, \n\ntherefore, are not as diverse as their pristine counterparts. \n\n Taxonomic indices often show unimodal patterns, with higher species richness for \n\nintermediate disturbance levels and contribute to the misconception that disturbance may be \n\nadvantageous to biodiversity. These indices are unable to accurately describe how \n\ndisturbances affect biodiversity, unless other metrics are taken into consideration. Functional \n\ndiversity indices are expected to decrease under high disturbance levels due to environmental \n\nfiltering (Cornwell et al., 2006; Flynn et al., 2009), and are thus perceived as better translators \n\nof disturbance effects on communities and ecosystems. According to the performance filter \n\nhypothesis, the environment determines the performance of species according to their trait \n\nsyndromes, posing environmental filters to communities and selecting trait combinations \n\nassociated with increased fitness in the occurring conditions (Mouillot et al., 2013b). This \n\nmeans that even milder disturbances may deplete populations of species with vulnerable \n\ncombinations of traits (e.g., habitat specialists) without modifying species composition and, \n\nthus, without affecting taxonomic indices. Functional and phylogenetic diversity indices \n\nprovide deeper insights into the complex effects that disturbances have on biodiversity \n\n(Cornwell et al., 2006). Functional richness in particular has been invoked as a good predictor \n\nof ecosystem service because it describes species traits, translating the capacity of each species \n\nto provide a particular service (D??az and Cabido, 2001). Indices based on both species traits \n\nand abundances, such as functional divergence or specialization, are more likely to act as \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n\t 200\t\n\nearly-warning indicators as they do not need species extirpations or local extinctions to change \n\n(Vill\u00e9ger et al., 2010). Our study corroborates such conceptions because, although anuran \n\nspecies richness, functional richness and phylogenetic diversity were significantly lower in \n\nrice fields, taxonomic diversity did not vary significantly. \n\n Phylogenetic diversity represents the total evolutionary history or phylogenetic \n\nrelatedness of all species in a community (Faith, 1992), being recognized as intrinsically \n\nvaluable for conservation (Winter et al., 2013). Several studies have suggested that \n\ncommunities with higher phylogenetic diversity are more stable (Cadotte et al., 2012), \n\nproductive (Cadotte, 2013) and support more species (Dinnage et al., 2012). However, despite \n\nthe known impacts of agriculture on species loss, the effects of habitat conversion on \n\nphylogenetic diversity remains largely unknown. Studies on plants and invertebrates suggest \n\nthat environmental disturbances favor subsets of closely related clades, resulting in \n\nphylogenetic diversity loss (Helmus et al., 2010). Global extinction risk assessments of birds \n\nand mammals suggest that particular branches are at greater extinction risk than others (Verde \n\nArregoitia et al., 2013). Although species richness was significantly decreased in rice fields, \n\nspecies loss alone did not account for declining phylogenetic diversity. The changes we \n\ndetected in phylogenetic diversity result from species loss and increased species relatedness. \n\nSpecies in pristine areas were less related to one another than expected by chance, whereas \n\nspecies in rice were more closely related. These patterns indicate that anuran phylogenetic \n\ndiversity loss in agriculture causes a shift in community composition while taxonomic \n\ndiversity remains relatively stable. \n\n Ecological resilience, the ability of ecosystems to absorb disturbances while \n\nmaintaining key functions (Folke et al., 2004), is increasingly crucial considering global \n\nchanges and increased human pressure on ecosystems. Ecosystem resilience safeguards vital \n\nservices upon which humans and biodiversity depend, such as seed dispersal, pollination, and \n\npest control (Foley et al., 2005). Functional richness and redundancy are important aspects of \n\necosystems resilience (Allen et al., 2005). While FRic describes the diversity and range of \n\nfunctional traits responsible for ecosystem services (Wright et al., 2006), functional \n\nredundancy represents the number of species fulfilling the same function. Ecosystems are \n\nmore resilient when a given function is fulfilled by multiple species, which minimizes the \n\n\n\nEvidence of anuran community disruption on rice crops: a multidimensional evaluation \n\n\t\n\n\t 201\t\n\nprobability of trait extinction. In highly functionally redundant communities, if one species \n\ngoes extinct, others will continue to fulfill the same functions and ensure community \n\nfunctioning even under increasing pressure, allowing long-term sustainability of ecosystems \n\nand their services (Tscharntke et al. 2005). Amphibians play keystone roles in ecosystem \n\nfunctioning; in food webs, they act as both predators on invertebrates and small vertebrates \n\nand as prey for larger animals, and they establish an avenue for nutrient transport between \n\naquatic and terrestrial systems. Loss of amphibian functional richness and an increase in \n\nfunctional divergence may affect vital ecosystem processes and contribute to loss of system \n\nresilience and resistance (Davic and Welsh, 2004). \n\n The dramatic decline in FRic and the increase in functional divergence following \n\nconversion of natural habitats to rice fields indicates that the loss of more sensitive species is \n\nnot counterbalanced by the addition of new, disturbance-tolerant species that could either fill \n\nvacant functional niches or occupy different functional roles. Anuran communities from rice \n\nfields were strongly dominated by a few generalist species (e.g., D. nanus, L. latrans), while \n\ncommunities from pristine areas were composed by more species, many specialists, occurring \n\nat lower abundances. These community changes provide strong evidence for environmental \n\nfiltering in agricultural landscapes. Generalists with short life cycles and high reproductive \n\ncapacities (i.e. r-selected species, Begon et al., 1996) are favored, and K-selected specialists \n\nare excluded from the communities due to lower ability to adapt to the fluctuating resources of \n\nintensively managed agricultural lands (Begon et al., 1996). While habitat loss and pesticide \n\nburden are important drivers of extinction of specialized and rare species, habitat \n\nfragmentation per se and the disrupted exchange of individuals between local communities \n\naffect less mobile species. Reduced dispersal affects meta-population dynamics, resulting in \n\nincreased extinction risk for less vagile species (Schweiger et al. 2005). Consequently, \n\nintensively cultivated landscapes will be dominated by generalist and mobile species. \n\nFunctional groups composed mainly of specialized, rare, or less mobile species have higher \n\nextinction risk when land use is intensified than groups dominated by generalist or highly \n\nmobile species (Schweiger et al., 2007). \n\n Small geographic ranges, association with forest and open area habitats, small clutches \n\nand large body size are associated with low to null species abundances in rice fields. Indeed, \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n\t 202\t\n\nwhile pristine communities were composed of many, similarly abundant species, with varied \n\ndegrees of habitat specialization, clutch and body size, agricultural communities were \n\ncomposed of few widespread habitat generalists, with smaller body size and larger clutches, \n\nsuch as D. nanus or L. latrans. Large body size and small range are the most common \n\npredictors of high extinction risk for several organisms (Botts et al., 2013; Gilroy et al., 2014; \n\nSodhi et al., 2008). The most consistently significant correlate with amphibian decline risk is \n\ngeographic range size (Botts et al., 2013). Small-range species are more likely to decline, \n\nbecome threatened and eventually suffer extinction (Devictor et al. 2010; Murray et al. 2011; \n\nSodhi et al. 2008). Species with small ranges are often less abundant, less mobile, poorer \n\ncompetitors and have lower reproductive success than more widespread species (Cooper et al., \n\n2008; Sodhi et al., 2008). The geographic area of a species depends on suitable environmental \n\nconditions, ability to disperse and to successfully compete with other species and survive \n\npredation (Olalla-T\u00e1rraga et al., 2011). Species with large ranges often tolerate a wide variety \n\nof conditions, while species with small ranges are only able to persist under a narrower range \n\nof conditions. Hence, the size of a species range is, at least partially, a spatial representation of \n\nits degree of specialization (Cooper et al., 2008; Devictor et al., 2010; Sodhi et al., 2008). \n\nStrong association with forest and open area habitats are also correlated with higher degrees of \n\nspecialization. The anurofauna of the Cerrado is composed of species strongly associated with \n\nforest formations, those dependent on open area formations and those that are widespread \n\ngeneralists (Valdujo et al., 2012). Forest associated species have specialized breeding \n\nstrategies, such as terrestrial clutches and lotic tadpoles, while open area specialists often \n\nproduce foam nests in subterranean chambers to minimize humidity loss and temperature \n\nfluctuation. Larger body sizes generally correlate with slower life history traits, thus \n\ndecreasing recovery potential after population crashes (Sodhi et al., 2008). Anuran body size \n\nreflects effects of reduced surface to volume ratios in larger species to control both heat and \n\nwater balance (Olalla-T\u00e1rraga et al. 2009); thus, larger species are commonly associated with \n\nhigh water deficit areas, whereas smaller species are usually found in humid areas. In addition, \n\nassuming resistance to desiccation relates to mobility, larger species forced to migrate across \n\nagricultural matrices, from shelter areas to breeding areas, might be more successful than \n\nsmaller ones. Our results indicate that agricultural activities such as pesticide application and \n\n\n\nEvidence of anuran community disruption on rice crops: a multidimensional evaluation \n\n\t\n\n\t 203\t\n\nploughing may be significantly more detrimental to larger species and may offset the \n\nphysiological advantage that larger body size has in regulating body temperature and \n\nincreasing mobility. Small clutches are correlated with decreased survival probabilities, \n\nespecially in unstable and adverse conditions, such as those present in agricultural \n\nenvironments. \n Most studies on the effects of agricultural activities on amphibians are based on \n\nabundance or density changes. While these metrics are useful, less conspicuous effects occur \n\nat the individual and population level. Although the effects of habitat change on body \n\ncondition are seldom studied, the few studies available indicate that anurans in agricultural \n\nareas have lower body condition than their pristine counterparts (e.g. Brodeur et al. 2011; \n\nKarraker and Welsh 2006; Neckel-oliveira 2007). Body condition indices are surrogates for \n\nthe animal\u2019s mass associated with energy reserves after correcting for structural body size. An \n\nindividual in good condition is assumed to have more energy reserves than an animal in poor \n\ncondition. As energy stores can be allocated for maintenance, growth or reproduction, animals \n\nwith larger energy reserves will usually have better fasting endurance, survival and \n\nreproductive output than individuals with smaller reserves (e.g., Bachman and Widemo 1999). \n\nConsequently, the lower body condition observed in frogs from cultivated sites is an indication \n\nthat these animals have reduced fitness and suggests that ecologically relevant parameters such \n\nas reproductive output and survival may be impaired in these populations (Brodeur et al., \n\n2011). Higher abundance of generalists in agricultural areas may result in increased \n\ncompetition for resources and in lower body condition. High exposure to fertilizers and \n\npesticides in crops may stimulate the organism\u2019s compensation/detoxification systems to re-\n\nestablish homeostasis, explaining the reduction of energy reserves due to physiological \n\nalterations and consequent increase of energetic maintenance costs. Another explanation for \n\nthe reduced body condition of frogs from agricultural areas would be for food intake to be \n\nlower in cultivated sites due to either the smaller area of habitat available or to a decrease in \n\nthe abundance of prey insects caused by insecticide applications. Our results highlight the \n\nneed for further investigations into the causes and consequences of the low body conditions \n\nconsistently found in anuran communities from agricultural environments. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n\t 204\t\n\n Understanding how species traits correlate with their responses to agriculture will \n\nallow better predictions of the functional effects of anthropogenic land-use (Newbold et al., \n\n2013). Diversity itself is an important component of ecosystem resilience because diverse \n\ncommunities are more likely to hold multiple species capable of contributing to a single given \n\nfunction. Our results show that the conversion of natural Cerrado-Amazon vegetation to vast \n\nrice fields results in such environmental stresses, that large subsets of species are driven to \n\nlocal extinction irrespective of their specialization. Species commonly perceived as resilient to \n\nhabitat alteration did not occur in these environments (e.g. Leptodactylus labyrinthicus, Heyer \n\n2005), which indicates that the new environmental filters, arisen as a consequence of replacing \n\nnative vegetation with rice fields, are more detrimental on Neotropical anurans than was \n\nexpected. Our results corroborate previous studies (e.g.,  Cooper et al. 2008; Hero, Williams, \n\nand Magnusson 2005; Lips, Reeve, and Witters 2003; Murray and Hose 2005) but also deliver \n\nnew insights into potential synergies of different drivers of anuran community change in \n\nagricultural environments. This study supports previous findings that traditional metrics such \n\nas taxonomic diversity can hide important information about the real impacts of anthropogenic \n\nland-use on species composition and ecosystem functioning. Integrative approaches provide \n\nholistic insights on the impacts and consequences of human-mediated disturbances on \n\nbiodiversity, potentially contributing to future conservation and agricultural management \n\ndecisions (Hidasi-Neto et al., 2012; Vandewalle et al., 2010). \n \n \n4.7.

Abstract \n\nDeforestation is a major driver of biodiversity loss, mainly due to agriculture. As \n\nrice is among the world\u2019s most important crops, determining how agricultural \n\ncommunities are shaped is imperative. However, few studies have addressed the factors \n\nthat alter community assembly in human-modified landscapes. We aim to quantify \n\ntaxonomic, functional, trait and phylogenetic diversity of an anuran community from rice \n\ncrops on a biodiversity hotspot. Identify local and landscape characteris- tics responsible \n\nfor variations in multiple dimensions of anuran diversity in rice crops. This study was \n\nperformed in Tocantins, Brazil. We chose 36 lentic waterbodies on rice fields for anuran \n\nsampling. We quantified taxonomic diversity (TD), functional diversity (FD) and \n\nphylogenetic diversity (PD) for each waterbody. We also estimated the mean functional \n\ndifferences among species for each trait separately. To evaluate how local and landscape \n\nscale features affect anurans, we performed generalized linear mixed models in 500, 1000 \n\nand 1500 m buffers around each waterbody. We found increased PD and FD in water- \n\nbodies closer to many other waterbodies and large forest patches. Anuran biomass \n\ndecreased with increasing distance to the closest waterbody. Trait diversity varied with \n\nwaterbody abundance and closeness, percentage of bare ground and marginal vegetation. \n\nOur study emphasizes the importance of waterbody and forest patch networks for \n\nmaintain- ing high anuran FD and PD in agricultural landscapes. As both metrics are \n\nknown to be related to ecosystem resilience, understanding these patterns is pivotal for \n\n\n\nLandscape and local correlates of anuran taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity in \nrice crops \n\n\t\n\n\t 219\t\n\nbiodiversity management, especially in the tropics, where agricultural expansion is \n\nunrelenting and biodiversity is especially unique.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords: Neotropics; agriculture; amphibians; traits. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5  \n\n\t 220\t\n\n5.2. Introduction \nDeforestation is a major driver of biodiversity loss, especially in the megadiverse \n\nNeotropics, where it is mainly caused by agricultural expansion (Garcia-Barrios et al. \n\n2009). Anthropogenic activities such as agriculture and cattle farming are known to cause \n\nprofound and complex alterations to communities and ecosystems (Williams-Guillen and \n\nPerfecto 2010; Frishkoff et al. 2014). Rice is the world\u2019s most important food crop, \n\noccupying 11% of the world\u2019s total arable land (Kang and Priyadarshan, 2007). Asian \n\ncountries are responsible for 90% of the world\u2019s production, while Latin America and the \n\nCaribbean produce 4.1%, half of which comes solely from Brazil (FAO, 2011). Several \n\nstudies have reported negative effects of habitat conversion to irrigated rice crops on \n\nbiodiversity (e.g. Attademo et al. 2011; Hyne et al. 2009; Maximiliano Attademo et al. \n\n2015). However, these agricultural wetlands have also been considered valuable for birds \n\nand amphibians (Czech and Parsons 2002; Elphick and Oring 2003; Bambaradeniya and \n\nAmarasinghe 2004; Leps et al. 2006) and even functional equivalents to natural wetlands. \n\n(Bambaradeniya and Amarasinghe 2004). Given the extension and location of rice fields \n\nworldwide, determining how communities living in these environments are shaped is of \n\nthe utmost concern, especially in the tropics, where rice production meets important \n\nsocial and economic demands, and biodiversity is especially high and unique. \n\nWetlands are important breeding habitats for many amphibian species and \n\nirrigated rice fields are invariably used by local amphibians to forage and reproduce. Due \n\nto their generally biphasic life cycle, highly permeable skin and ectothermic physiology, \n\namphibians are very dependent on environmental quality and vulnerable to its change \n\n(Niemi and McDonald 2004). These characteristics have made amphibians the most \n\nthreatened vertebrates worldwide, especially due to habitat destruction (Stuart, 2004). \n\nThey play keystone roles in ecosystem functioning, acting as both predators and prey, \n\nenable nutrient transport between aquatic and terrestrial systems and are among the most \n\ndiverse and abundant vertebrates, comprising species from a variety of habits, breeding \n\nstrategies and dispersal abilities. Loss of amphibian species may therefore affect vital \n\necosystem processes and contribute to loss of system resilience and resistance (Davie and \n\nWelsh 2004). Due to their ecological importance and sensitivity, amphibians constitute \n\n\n\nLandscape and local correlates of anuran taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity in \nrice crops \n\n\t\n\n\t 221\t\n\nreliable surrogates to evaluate the effects of human disturbances on whole communities \n\nand ecosystems (Davie and Welsh 2004). \n\nAlthough some studies have already investigated the variables that affect \n\ncommunity composition in anthropogenic landscapes, most were based on taxonomic \n\nmetrics (Sodhi and Ehrlich 2010), leaving important community and ecosystem-level \n\nconsequences unaddressed. Species richness relies on the assumption that all species are \n\nequal, i.e., only relative abundances determine the importance of species in communities \n\n15 and ecosystems (Magurran 2004). However, some species are more distinct from an \n\nevolutionary perspective or carry functional traits especially important for ecosystem \n\nprocesses than others (Cadotte et al. 2010; Mouillot et al. 2013). As the effects of \n\nanthropogenic environmental alteration on species are ultimately mediated by traits (e.g. \n\nphysiological constraints, habitat preference, dispersal ability), considering only \n\ntaxonomic metrics may fail to provide accurate conclusions on the real consequences of \n\nanthropization on biodiversity. \n\nLandscape modification often creates new environmental filters that favor \n\nparticular attributes for species persistence, generating generalist communities with \n\nspecies richness similar and sometimes even higher than pristine environments. In order \n\nto attain more representative conclusions on the effects human activities have on \n\ncommunities, we must account for different components of biodiversity, such as \n\nfunctional (FD) and phylogenetic (PD) diversity. \n\nFD describes the variability in ecological attributes among species, being often \n\nconsidered representative of ecosystem resistance, resilience and functioning (Petchey \n\nand Gaston 2006). Measuring FD is equivalent to measuring functional trait diversity, \n\nwhere functional traits are components of an organism\u2019s phenotype that influence \n\necosystem processes. PD analyzes the evolutionary differences between species (Faith, \n\n1992), representing an estimate of phylogenetically conserved ecological and phenotypic \n\ndifferences between species (Cavender-Bares et al. 2009). This metric may characterize \n\nthe evolutionary potential of biodiversity to respond to environments (Cisneros, Fagan, \n\nand Willig 2014). Studies approaching the effects anthropogenic landscapes have on \n\nspecies traits, FD or PD (Tscharntke et al. 2012) are still scarce but, while most focused \n\n\n\nChapter 5  \n\n\t 222\t\n\non plant and invertebrate assemblages (e.g., Arroyo-Rodr\u00edguez et al. 2012; Aviron et al. \n\n2005; Laliberte et al. 2010), others have successfully explored the effects human \n\nactivities have on vertebrate communities (e.g. Ernst et al. 2006, Trimble and Aarde \n\n2014). However, the influences of landscape and local features of agricultural landscapes \n\non communities are seldom investigated (but see Cisneros et al., 2014). \n\nHuman-mediated landscape modification is spatially complex, as native \n\nformations are fragmented and replaced by a variety of anthropogenic land cover types. \n\nThese new landscape matrices are not completely inhospitable to biota, and species \n\ndispersal ability and plasticity in resource use often determine its ability to endure in \n\nthese environments (Kupfer et al., 2006; Perfecto &amp; Vandermeer, 2008). \n\nLand cover change alters resource availability and diversity, as well as \n\nconnectivity among resource patches. Landscape modification has three main \n\nconsequences for the fauna: loss of native vegetation; fragmentation and alteration of \n\nmatrix permeability (Tscharntke et al., 2012). Because species are affected in multi- \n\ndimensional manners (e.g. landscape composition and configuration), understanding the \n\neffects of native vegetation loss, fragmentation, and matrix configuration on community \n\nassembly requires considering multiple scale-dependent compositional and \n\nconfigurational landscape features. \n\nWe aim to quantify taxonomic, functional, trait and phylogenetic diversity of an \n\nanuran community from rice crops in a Neotropical biodiversity hotspot. Our objective \n\nwas to identify local and landscape characteristics responsible for variations in multiple \n\ndimensions of anuran diversity. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the \n\neffects that landscape and local features of agricultural systems have on taxonomic, \n\nfunctional, trait and phylogenetic diversity of a Neotropical anuran community. \n\n \n\n5.3. Methods \n5.3.1. Study area and sampling design \n\nThis study took place in an ecotone region between the Amazon rainforest and the \n\nBrazilian savanna, the Cerrado, in the municipal district of Lagoa da Confus\u00e3o, state of \n\nTocantins, Brazil. Agricultural landscapes of this area are characterized by the presence \n\n\n\nLandscape and local correlates of anuran taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity in \nrice crops \n\n\t\n\n\t 223\t\n\nof ipucas, \u201cislands\u201d of closed native vegetation which remain flooded longer than the \n\nsurrounding areas. These landscapes are composed of vast crop areas speckled by many \n\n\u201cislands\u201d of native vegetation of variable dimensions. The region is a seasonally flooded \n\narea, with a very pronounced rainy season from October to April. \n\nIrrigated rice fields in the Cerrado-Amazon ecotone present a dynamic hydrologic \n\nregime, with variation between aquatic and terrestrial phases. When rice is being grown, \n\nfrom December to April, rice fields remain with surface water until harvest, before which \n\ncrops are completely drained. After rice harvesting, crops may remain fallow or other \n\ncrops may be cultivated, depending on the landowner\u2019s will. Besides rice fields, the \n\nregion\u2019s landscape is also occupied by pasture areas, where cows, emus or water buffalos \n\nroam. This area has been under agricultural exploration for the last 30 years, especially \n\ntargeting rice production. Given the temporal extent of this exploration, we consider these \n\ncommunities as stable, despite the use of pesticides and crop management procedures. \n\nWe chose a total of 10 rice fields along the Rio Formoso irrigation project (Fig. \n\n5.1). Rice fields varied in size, ipuca and waterbody abundance and size. We selected 4 \n\nto 5 temporary lentic waterbodies for anuran sampling in each rice field, totalizing 35 \n\nwaterbodies. In order to investigate how local and landscape characteristics affect anuran \n\ndiversity in rice crops, sampled waterbodies were chosen to represented the variance in \n\nhabitat and landscape-level characteristics present in rice crop waterbodies. Due to \n\nlogistic constraints, average accessibility to the waterbodies was also considered, as \n\ndifficulty to sample was an important constraint for some waterbodies. We chose small \n\n(25 m2) to large (1200 m2) waterbodies. All waterbodies were located inside the \n\nagricultural matrix or less than 50 m from rice crops. All waterbodies were at least 450 m \n\napart, and the maximum distance between waterbodies was 7km. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5  \n\n\t 224\t\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n5.3.2. Anuran surveys \n\n Agricultural surveys were conducted during two rainy seasons, from February \n\n2013 to April 2014. Anuran sampling was performed using nocturnal visual encounter \n\nsurveys along the 10 m wide margin of each waterbody, for approximately 30 min. Every \n\nindividual seen perched on the vegetation, on the floor, under the leaf litter, logs or stones \n\nwas caught, identified, measured, weighed, photographed and then released near the site \n\nof origin. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1. Study area and design. Dark circles represent the waterbodies sampled.

Local waterbodies characteristics \n\n Environmental variables such as percentage of bare ground, herbaceous \n\nvegetation, shrubs, trees, shaded ground, leaf litter, logs/rocks, aquatic vegetation, \n\nherbaceous vegetation height, shrub vegetation height, herbaceous vegetation \n\nheterogeneity and shrub vegetation heterogeneity were registered.  These variables were \n\nquantified performing transects (10 m long x 1 m wide) set on the sampled waterbody \n\nmargin. For every meter, a 50 cm x 50 cm grid would be placed above the ground and the \n\nnumber of squares with 50% or more coverage of each variable would be summed and \n\ndivided by the total (25 squares). \n\n \n\n5.3.4. Landscape features \n\n We quantified landscape features on the vicinity of each waterbody using high \n\nresolution Google Earth satellite imagery representing the landscape of the year 2014, on \n\nwhich we could easily discern crops from natural vegetation. This satellite classification \n\nwas afterwards corroborated through presential visits to the main features on the field. \n\nFor each of the 36 sampled waterbodies, we quantified distance to the closest waterbody, \n\ndistance to the closest forest patch and number of waterbodies, number of forest patches, \n\ntotal waterbody area, total forest area, mean forest patch area and mean waterbody area \n\nwithin 500 m, 1000 m and 1500 m buffers (Fig. 5.1). While compositional features, such \n\nas number of forest patches or total waterbody area describe the proportions of different \n\ntypes of land use within the area surrounding a waterbody, configurational features, such \n\nas distance to the closest forest patch or waterbody, specify the geometric arrangement of \n\nland features surrounding a waterbody. Both compositional and configurational features \n\nwere considered based on the acknowledged importance of such features for amphibian \n\nbreeding success, migration and, consequently, metapopulation sustenance (Dodd, 2009). \n\nTrying to cover every possible function these features might have for the anuran \n\ncommunity, we decided to consider multiple variables, despite their high apparent \n\ncorrelation. For example, while mean forest patch size and number of forest patches are \n\ncorrelated, they address different perspectives; mean forest patch size is important for \n\naddressing species which mostly exist within those environments, while number of forest \n\n\n\nChapter 5  \n\n\t 226\t\n\npatches addresses the stepping stone character of each forest patch, and therefore, is \n\nrelevant to species that use forest patches in dispersion.  \n\nBecause spatial patterns are scale dependent, and anuran communities from \n\nanthropogenic environments are affected by different features on different scales, the \n\nscale at which anurans react to the environment differs among species, depending on a \n\nseries of traits (Gorresen et al., 2005; Klingbeil &amp; Willig, 2009). We quantified landscape \n\ncharacteristics at three spatial scales (buffers of 500, 1000 and 1500 m radius) that we \n\nfound significant for amphibians regarding known dispersal abilities, to account for \n\ninterspecific differences in anuran dispersal and ability to endure in agricultural systems. \n\n \n\n5.3.5. Anuran Data \n\n We compiled life history and ecological traits for every anuran species registered \n\nin the agricultural and pristine study areas. For each species we compiled information of \n\n12 traits: activity, habits, habitat, fossorial behavior, adult snout-vent length (SVL), \n\nbreeding site, breeding strategy, clutch size, parental care, breeding season, breeding \n\npattern and geographic range size. We chose these traits based on perceived importance \n\nfor determining species resilience to agricultural activities (Table A1) and on data \n\navailability. We compiled trait data from the literature, the AmphibiaWeb and IUCN \n\nonline databases. If published data were unavailable, we relied on expert opinion or \n\ninferred trait information based on closely related species. Because breeding site, \n\nbreeding season and breeding pattern were very homogeneous along the agricultural \n\nanuran community, we decided to exclude these three traits from the following analyses.  \n\nWe used the phylogenetic tree built by Isaac et al. (2012) from the amphibian \n\n\u2018tree of life\u2019 described by Faivovich et al. (2006), with 5713 amphibian species and \n\nrespective branch lengths. We pruned this supertree to build a smaller phylogenetic tree \n\nwith every species sampled in rice crops. All operations related to pruning the original \n\nIsaac et al. (2012) supertree were performed using package Ape (Paradis et al. 2004) in \n\nprogram R. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nLandscape and local correlates of anuran taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity in \nrice crops \n\n\t\n\n\t 227\t\n\n5.3.6. Biodiversity metrics  \n\n At each site we quantified TD using Simpson\u2019s diversity index (Simpson, 1949), \n\nand FD and PD through Rao\u2019s quadratic entropy (Botta-Duke at, 2005). As Rao\u2019s Q \n\nderives from Simpson\u2019s index, hence including information on species differences, it can \n\nbe used for the three dimensions (TD, FD and PD), which facilitates the comparison \n\namong different metrics. Rao\u2019s Q corresponds to the sum of functional or phylogenetic \n\ndistances among all species, weighted by the product of their abundances, hence \n\ndescribing the abundance-weighted average difference between species from a \n\ncommunity (Weiher, 2011).  \n\nRao's Q, is commonly used in a multi-trait perspective, however, due to its \n\nintrinsic versatility, it can also be used to translate variability in trait state, e.g. regarding \n\nhabits, how many different habits are in the space we are studying. Given the amount of \n\ntrait information we collected for this community, we decided to explore how rice crops \n\naffected variability in trait state, and go beyond FD, which measures overall functional \n\ntrait diversity. Hence, because landscape and local agricultural features may affect \n\nparticular traits differently, we estimated the mean functional differences among species \n\nfor each trait separately (e.g., habitat, breeding mode), as well as for all traits combined, \n\ncorresponding to the FD metric. We obtained functional and phylogenetic distances \n\nbetween species from pairwise dissimilarity matrices for each trait separately, for all \n\ntraits combined, and for the phylogeny. We built functional pairwise dissimilarity \n\nmatrices using the Gower distance matrix, which quantifies dissimilarities with \n\ncategorical and numeric attributes simultaneously (Botta-Duk\u00e9 at, 2005). In order to \n\ncompare dimensions, we transformed each metric into its effective number of species \n\n(Jost, 2006), allowing direct interpretation of differences among indices (Jost, 2006). We \n\ncalculated FD with function dfFD from package FD, and PD and TD with function raoD \n\nfrom package picante on program R. \n\nWe also determined anuran biomass directly, through the total anuran weight \n\ncollected in each waterbody, and tested how it was affected by the considered predictors. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5  \n\n\t 228\t\n\n5.3.7. Phylogenetic signal  \n\n To facilitate ecological interpretation of phylogenetic patterns, we used abouheif\u2019s \n\nCmean test to measure the strength of phylogenetic signal of the traits we used. \n\nAbouheif\u2019s Cmean tests the statistical dependence between species\u2019 traits due to \n\nphylogenetic affinities, using Revell et al. (2008) both categorical and mensural \n\nattributes. This approach evaluates if traits on a phylogeny are overdispersed, \n\nindependent, consistent with a model of Brownian motion or conserved. If trait \n\ndistribution along a phylogeny is consistent with a model of Brownian motion or \n\nconserved, traits exhibit phylogenetic signal and phylogenetic patterns can be interpreted \n\nwith regard to those traits. Abouheif\u2019s Cmean test of phylogenetic signal was calculated \n\nwith the R package adephylo (Jombart &amp; Dray, 2010).  \n\n \n\n5.3.8. Quantitative analyses  \n\nWe performed principal component analysis on waterbody characteristics, in \n\norder to assess local variable importance for overall variance and inter-variable \n\ncorrelation. We used package FactoMineR (L\u00ea et al. 2008). \n\nWe performed generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to examine the effects \n\nof local and landscape features on anuran biomass and taxonomic, phylogenetic, \n\nfunctional and trait diversity. Because the 1000 and 1500 m buffers used to characterize \n\nthe surroundings of each waterbody included other waterbodies within the same rice \n\nfield, we used rice field as random effect. Random effects are especially useful for \n\ninferring on a population when the data available are random samples of that population, \n\nassuming it is a meta-population, and that our sample reflects many draws from that \n\npopulation. So rather than anchoring results around heterogeneous intercepts, the data \n\nwill be used to elucidate the parameters of that distribution from which data were drawn. \n\nModel fit for each dependent variable was manually assessed from the null model, \n\nto avoid automatic variable elimination for the sake of model fit optimization only. We \n\nchoose to assess model fit and predictor significance through F-tests performed among \n\nnested models por each dependent variable (FD, PD, TD, each trait\u2019s diversity and \n\nBiomass), first progressively evaluating each predictor\u2019s significance, then fitting \n\n\n\nLandscape and local correlates of anuran taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity in \nrice crops \n\n\t\n\n\t 229\t\n\nreduced models with the most significant predictors, and finally assessing the reduced \n\nmodels\u2019 fit against the full model, using F tests. We fit all models using the lme4 package \n\n(Bates 2007). \n\nWe performed hierarchical partitioning (HP) to further determine the relative \n\nindependent importance of each significant variable. We determined the statistical \n\nsignificance of each independent variable\u2019s independent contribution using a \n\nrandomization approach with 5000 iterations and an alpha- level of 0.05 (Mac Nally, \n\n2002). We executed hierarchical partitioning using package \u2018hier.part\u2019 (Mac Nally &amp; \n\nWalsh, 2004). \n\n \n\n5.4. Results \nRelationships between landscape and local characteristics and anuran diversity \n\nwere scale and metric-specific (Table 5.1). TD variation across waterbodies was affected \n\nmainly by local waterbody and landscape characteristics (F(8, 26) = 14.78,  p = 0.048, \n\nTable 1). TD decreased 67% with increased percentage of terrestrial leaf-litter (Fig. \n\n5.2E), and with increased mean forest patch area within the 500 m buffer (Fig. 5.2D).  \n\nVariation in PD was mainly accounted for by the number of forest patches within \n\nthe 1500 m buffer (F(9, 26) = 20.34,  p = 0.034); increased number of forest patches was \n\nassociated to a 92% increase in phylogenetic diversity (Fig. 5.2C). Phylogenetic signal \n\nwas significant for only four traits (Table 5.2), being stronger for habits, breeding \n\nstrategy and parental care. Hence, PD is not a surrogate for FD, as phylogeny is only \n\nrelated to trait diversity regarding 3 traits. Therefore, it is important to consider PD, as \n\nwell as FD and trait diversity, because all these metrics account for some independent \n\nvariability.  \n\nVariation in FD considering all functional components jointly, was best accounted \n\nfor by mean forest patch and waterbody area in the 1500 m buffer (F(8, 26) = 35.84,  p = \n\n0.029; Table 1); higher mean forest patch and waterbody area caused a 6.5 and 8.7% \n\nincrease in functional diversity, respectively (Fig. 5.2A, B). Anuran biomass was mostly \n\naffected by distance to the closest waterbody, decreasing 95% with increased distance to \n\nthe closest waterbody (F(8, 26) = 74.97,  p = 0.021; Fig. 5.2F). \n\n\n\nChapter 5  \n\n\t 230\t\n\nDecomposing FD into its functional components revealed considerable \n\nheterogeneity regarding the effects landscape and local variables have on each trait\u2019s \n\ndiversity (Table 5.1). Anuran activity diversity decreased 25% with increased distance to \n\nthe closest waterbody (F(9, 26) = 79.44,  p = 0.019; Fig. 5.3A). Diversity in anuran habits \n\nwas affected mainly by local waterbody characteristics, namely percentage of bare \n\nground, increasing 47% with increased bare ground (F(9, 26) = 32.27,  p = 0.031; Fig.  \n\n5.3B). Diversity in anuran habitats was predicted by the number of waterbodies within \n\nthe 500 m buffer, increasing 21% with higher waterbody abundance (F(9, 26) = 21.07,  p = \n\n0.033; Fig. 5.3C). Diversity in adult snout-vent-length and anuran breeding strategy were \n\nmainly affected by local waterbody characteristics. SVL diversity increased 11% with \n\nincreasing shrub height and percentage of shaded ground (F(8, 26) = 17.31,  p = 0.044; Fig.  \n\n5.3D, E). Breeding strategy diversity increased 56% with increased percentage of shaded \n\nground (F(9, 26) = 19.20,  p = 0.037; Fig. 5.3F). Diversity in clutch size was mainly \n\npredicted by the distance to the closest waterbody, decreasing 25% with increasing \n\ndistance to the nearest waterbody (F(9, 26) = 43.97,  p = 0.021; Fig. 5.4A). Diversity in \n\nparental care was mainly predicted by local waterbody characteristics, especially \n\npercentage of bare ground, and total waterbody area within the 1000 m buffer (F(8, 26) \n\n= 23.70,  p = 0.031; Table 5.1). Parental care diversity increased 33% with increasing \n\npercentage of bare ground, and decreased 23% with increasing total waterbody area \n\nwithin the 1000 m buffer (Fig. 5.4B, C). Range diversity was mainly affected by the total \n\nforest patch area within the 500 m buffer, increasing 24% with increased total forest area \n\n(F(9, 26) = 16.81,  p = 0.046; Fig. 5.4D). \n\nThe apparent departure from linearity in some relationships (Fig 5.2D, E; Fig. \n\n5.2F; Fig. 5.4C) is caused by the insufficient sampling of waterbodies in the intermediate \n\nand maximum state regarding predictor variables. For example, regarding the \n\nrelationships among TD and mean forest area, we apparently failed to sample more \n\nwaterbodies within the intermediate and maximum amount of forest area within the 500m \n\nbuffer. Hence, while the relation appears linear for those levels, there is a cluster of \n\nwaterbodies with a small amount of forest area visually confounding the overall \n\nrelationship. \n\n\n\nLandscape and local correlates of anuran taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity in \nrice crops \n\n\t\n\n\t 231\t\n\nThe most significant predictors for the GLMM models were in agreement with the HP \n\nresults, which determines the independent contribution from each predictor.    \n\n \n\nDependent \nvariable \n\nPredictors Estimates (SE) Hierarchical \npartitioning \n\n(%) \n\nMarginal \nR2 \n\nConditional \nR2 \n\nFD \n\nIntercept 0.958 (0.004)  0.444 0.751 \nMeanFoA1500 0.018 (0.004) 24.82   \nMeanWbA1500 0.007 (0.005) 25.73   \n\nPD \nIntercept -35.360 (4.164)  0.645 0.869 \nNrFo1500 6.280 (2.634) 40.45   \n\nTD \n\nIntercept 0.376 (0.067)  0.400 0.743 \nPCA4 0.047 (0.045) 18.78   \nMeanFoA500 -0.157 (0.084) 15.54   \n\nBiomass \nIntercept 128.05 (43.40)  0.505 0.867 \nDistCloserWb -58.79 (17.43) 64.71   \n\nActivity \nIntercept 0.851 (0.011)  0.370 0.621 \nDistCloserWb -0.045 (0.011) 83.605   \n\nHabits \nIntercept 0.808 (0.020)  0.452 0.764 \nPCA1 -0.028 (0.011) 36.486   \n\nHabitat \nIntercept 0.919 (0.013)  0.578 0.797 \nNrWb500 0.035 (0.007) 42.396   \n\nSVL \nIntercept 0.948 (0.005)  0.320 0.641 \nPCA2 0.007 (0.003) 47.901   \n\nB.

Discussion \n Our study shows that communities from anthropogenic environments are shaped \n\nby multiple scale-dependent features. Furthermore, our trait-based approach allowed us to \n\nbetter understand how community assembly is shaped in human-modified landscapes, \n\nspecifically how local and landscape features affect different facets of biodiversity. \n\nVariation in TD was best explained by local waterbody characteristics and a \n\ncompositional landscape variable, whereas variation in FD and PD were best explained \n\nonly by landscape characteristics. This illustrates the complex ways in which human \n\ndisturbances can affect different dimensions of biodiversity. Furthermore, it demonstrates \n\nhow taking one diversity metric as the sole describer of biodiversity is too simplistic and \n\nmay lead to erroneous conclusions and flawed management plans. Nonetheless, \n\nbiodiversity is still seldom assessed using multidimensional and multi-scale approaches. \n\nTo our knowledge, this was the first study to address the effects of local and landscape \n\nvariables on multiple and complementary anuran diversity metrics in anthropogenic \n\nenvironments. \n\nTD was lower in waterbodies with more terrestrial leaf-litter i.e., in waterbodies \n\nmore marginal to rice crops, only partially embedded in rice crops. This, along with the \n\nassociation of lower TD with increased mean forest patch area within the 500 m buffer, \n\nmay suggest that species prefer breeding inside forest patches (Becker et al. (2010)). \n\nTrait Obs. Std. Obs.

Because \n\ncommunity assembly processes act on traits, species\u2019 response to environmental variation \n\nmay be reliably translated by the measured functional attributes (FD) or by unmeasured \n\ncharacteristics (addressed through PD). PD increased with increasing number of forest \n\npatches, which may be explained by the decreased PD in communities from rice crops \n\ncompared to their pristine counterparts (Ribeiro et al.  in prep). Waterbodies close to \n\nmore forest patches exhibit higher PD because species living on those patches may be \n\nable to disperse and colonize waterbodies within rice crops if these are sufficiently close \n\nto ensure dispersal and survival. Similarly, variation in FD, which considers every \n\nfunctional trait jointly, increased with higher mean forest patch and waterbody area. Both \n\ndimensions highlight a pattern of increased diversity in waterbodies closer to many others \n\nand large forest patches, emphasizing the importance of forest patches and waterbodies in \n\nmaintaining diverse anuran communities in agricultural landscapes. Distance from forest \n\npatch has been considered an important predictor of species richness, especially for \n\nspecies with low dispersal ability (Otto et al. 2007; Silva and Rossa-Feres 2011, Silva et \n\nal. 2011). Due to amphibian\u2019s ecophysiological limitations (Duellman and Trueb 1994), \n\nlow mobility (Gibbs 1998), and high mortality during dispersal through roads or \n\nagricultural matrices (Becker et al. 2007), colonizing isolated ponds is impossible for \n\nsome species and leads to selective exclusion from these waterbodies (Silva and Rossa- \n\nFeres 2011). PD and FD are important aspects of ecosystem resilience (Allen et al. 2005; \n\nCisneros et al. 2014), the ability of ecosystems to absorb disturbances while maintaining \n\nkey functions (Folke et al. 2004), increasingly crucial considering global changes and \n\nincreased human pressure on ecosystems. Ecosystem resilience safeguards vital services \n\nupon which humans and biodiversity depend, such as seed dispersal, pollination, and pest \n\ncontrol (Foley et al. 2005). Ecosystems are more resilient when every function is fulfilled \n\nby at least one species. Due to their ecological importance, loss of anuran diversity may \n\n\n\nChapter 5  \n\n\t 238\t\n\naffect vital ecosystem processes and contribute to loss of system resilience and resistance \n\n(Davic and Welsh 2004). \n\nThe importance of landscape and local features for anuran assemblages was trait- \n\nspecific. Anuran biomass and several traits (anuran activity, habitat, clutch size and range \n\nsize diversity) showed increased diversity with increased waterbody proximity and area.  \n\nWaterbody proximity, abundance and area has been determined as important for species \n\ndiversity and abundance, often linked to the amphibian\u2019s need to avoid desiccation \n\n(Salazar et al. 2016). Due to diurnal environmental constraints, such as high temperatures \n\nand low humidity, most anurans from the Cerrado are nocturnal, while diurnal anuran are \n\nusually more associated to forest physiognomies (Olalla-T\u00e1rraga et al. 2009). Hence, \n\ndistance to the closest waterbody may determine dispersion survival and, consequently, \n\nsuccess in colonizing new waterbodies. Waterbody networks also offer increased shelter, \n\ncalling, oviposition, and foraging site availability, in numerous waterbodies located \n\nrelatively closer to each other. More isolated waterbodies may present increased \n\ndesiccation risk during migration, as well as lower microhabitat availability, possibility \n\nwith every shelter/oviposition/foraging site saturated, leading to competitive exclusion of \n\nsome species (Becker et al. 2007, Russildi et al. 2016). Therefore, waterbody networks \n\nare especially important for amphibian communities in agricultural landscapes due to the \n\noften hostile conditions of those environments. Networks provide increased dispersion \n\nsuccess, and higher availability of ecological niches, calling and oviposition sites, making \n\nthem of the utmost importance for sustaining diverse anuran communities in agricultural \n\nlandscapes.  \n\nRange diversity also increased with increasing forest area. The presence of forest \n\npatches in the vicinities of the waterbody allows the subsistence of less generalist species \n\nthat probably use the patches as shelter and occasionally breed in agricultural waterbodies \n\nclose by (Silva and Rossa-Feres 2011, Silva et al. 2011), causing an increased diversity in \n\nrange size.  \n\nAnuran SVL, habits, breeding strategies and parental care diversity increased with \n\nincreasing bare ground, vegetation height and shaded ground, expressing the ability that \n\nwaterbodies more marginal to rice crops have to sustain increased trait diversity than \n\n\n\nLandscape and local correlates of anuran taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity in \nrice crops \n\n\t\n\n\t 239\t\n\nwaterbodies embedded in the agricultural matrix. Indeed, both percentage of bare ground \n\nand vegetation height have been considered important for amphibian abundance and \n\ndiversity, due to its direct influence on amphibian desiccation risk and reproductive \n\nsuccess (Scheele et al. 2012, Cline and Hunter 2014). Larger anurans tend to incur in \n\nincreased desiccation risk due a larger surface area, which may explain increased SVL \n\ndiversity in marginal waterbodies, with increased shelter availability and microclimate \n\nstability, due to diverse marginal vegetation (Olalla-T\u00e1rraga et al. 2009). This explains \n\nwhy waterbodies embedded in rice crops appear to be mainly colonized by smaller \n\nspecies, with similar habits and breeding strategies. Marginal waterbodies offer increased \n\nmicrohabitat diversity and availability, hosting an increased diversity of species with \n\ndiverse traits. Waterbodies embedded in rice crops offer little breeding site diversity, \n\nwhich explains why waterbodies marginal to the crops held increased diversity in traits \n\nrelated to breeding strategies. \n\nOur study is the first to approach how scale-dependent features shape anuran \n\nfunctional and phylogenetic diversity in agricultural landscapes. Our results emphasize \n\nthe importance of creating and/or conserving networks of abundant and large forest \n\npatches and waterbodies for sustaining higher levels of FD and PD in agricultural \n\nlandscapes. As both PD and FD are known to greatly contribute to ecosystem resilience, \n\nwe believe the patterns observed for anuran communities are of the utmost importance \n\nfor managing of agricultural lands, especially in the tropics, where agricultural expansion \n\nis unrelenting and biodiversity is especially high and unique. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nWe would like to thank two anonymous reviewers and an editor, whose opinions \n\nand suggestions much contributed to the improvement of this manuscript.  \n\nJoana Ribeiro is a PhD candidate with a fellowship (reference SFRH / BD / 51414 / \n\n2011) awarded by FCT (Foundation for Science and Technology).

Enhancing connectivity among fragmented habitats is therefore \n\npivotal for conservation planning. Amphibians are frequently characterized as having \n\nlimited dispersal abilities, strong site fidelity and spatially distant breeding habitats. Hence, \n\nsuccess in amphibian conservation, restoration or management can only be achieved by \n\nevaluating how structural connectivity relates to a species\u2019 functional connectivity. We \n\nperformed graph-theoretic network analysis to a set of waterbodies embedded in rice crops, \n\nto estimate the importance of each waterbody to the connectivity of the entire network. We \n\nused anuran diversity metrics (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity) as proxies \n\nof anuran functional connectivity, as species diversity has previously been related with \n\nlandscape connectivity. We found that forest patch area and abundance, as well as waterbody \n\narea in the vicinities of a waterbody, were the most important predictors of waterbody \n\nimportance for connectivity. Although our approach of network analysis followed the \n\nsimplest model, and cannot be generalized to other cases without caution, our results suggest \n\nthat, in order to maximize pond network connectivity for amphibians in rice crops, we must \n\nensure the existence of (i) abundant and large forest patches in the area surrounding \n\nwaterbodies, and (ii) a network of abundant waterbodies.  \n\n \n\nKeywords: Meta-populations; dispersal; Neotropics; Cerrado; amphibians.  \n \n\n\n\n                                            Anuran Functional Connectivity In Rice Crops: A Graph-Theoretic Approach \n\n\t\n\n\t 247\t\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6  \n\n248\t\n\n\t\n\n \n\n6.2 Introduction \nNatural habitat loss and fragmentation are the main causes of biodiversity loss in \n\nagricultural landscapes (Liira et al., 2008). The effects of habitat fragmentation on species \n\nrichness and composition have been extensively studied (Ockinger et al., 2010). However, little \n\nis known about how fragmentation affects other facets of biodiversity, such as functional or \n\nphylogenetic diversity. Fragmentation can indeed affect plant functional diversity directly (e.g. \n\nby promoting traits associated to long distance dispersal when fragment isolation increases) and \n\nindirectly (e.g. by decreasing species richness, hence trait diversity, when fragment area \n\ndecreases) (Magnago et al., 2014; Sonnier et al., 2014). Certain ecological traits, such as \n\nnaturally low population size, strong habitat specialization, large body size and low mobility \n\nhave been shown to be associated to a increased sensitivity to fragmentation in some vertebrate \n\ngroups (Ewers and Didham, 2006; Henle et al., 2004; Laurance, 1991; Viveiros De Castro and \n\nFernandez, 2004). A common explanation for this phenomenon is that habitat fragmentation \n\nmay filter species with particular sets of traits, leading to trait convergence (Grime, 2006) and \n\ndecreased functional diversity. Although the identification of these traits is critical for designing \n\nspecies-specific conservation strategies (Kotiaho et al., 2005; Purvis et al., 2000), few studies \n\nhave addressed the effects of habitat fragmentation on functional or phylogenetic diversity.  \n\nA wide range of measures has been developed to quantify habitat connectivity that either \n\nmeasure structural or functional connectivity (Tischendorf and Fahrig, 2000). Structural \n\nconnectivity can be easily determined, for example, by calculating landscape metrics obtained \n\nfrom geographic information systems, or simply by estimating geographic distances among \n\nhabitats or populations. Because it is easily measured, structural connectivity is often used as a \n\nproxy for functional connectivity, although the response of species may not necessarily be \n\nequivalent to the spatial configuration and composition of a landscape (Tischendorf and Fahrig, \n\n2000). Functional connectivity can be measured either by directly observing the movement of \n\nspecies, for example, by radio-tracking or mark-recapture studies, or indirectly by using \n\npopulation genetic data (Keller et al., 2010).  \n\nEnhancing connectivity among fragmented habitats is a major goals of conservation \n\n\n\n                                            Anuran Functional Connectivity In Rice Crops: A Graph-Theoretic Approach \n\n\t\n\n\t 249\t\n\nplanning (Br\u00fcckmann et al., 2010). However, success in conservation, restoration or ecological \n\nmanagement can only be achieved by evaluating to which degree an increase in structural \n\nconnectivity (for example, the creation of stepping stones) improves the functional connectivity \n\nof target species. Because structural connectivity is generally used as an equivalent of functional \n\nconnectivity in conservation, ecological literature and even management plans, it may lead to \n\ninaccurate and unsuccessful conservation schemes (Taylor et al., 2006).  \n\nModels such as \u201cleast cost path analysis\u201d (e.g., LaRue and Nielsen, 2008), or \u201cgraph-\n\ntheoretic\u201d models are often used to study connectivity and aid in management planning. One of \n\nthe most popular approaches in meta-population ecology, is patch-based monitoring, wherein \n\nspecies occupancy is recorded in a network of discrete habitat patches of varying size and \n\nisolation. Attributes of the habitat patches, matrix areas, and/or the species of interest are used \n\nin a modeling framework to determine how strongly connectivity and other factors influence \n\nspecies occupancy, colonization, or extinction probabilities. Patch connectivity can be measured \n\nin a variety of ways, from the simplest nearest-neighbor distance to more complex formulas that \n\ninclude patch distances, areas, species dispersal abilities, and other scaling parameters (Hanski \n\n1994b).  \n\nGraph-theoretic connectivity metrics combine the attributes of habitats and populations \n\nwith the dispersal behavior of species (Saura and Pascual-Hortal, 2007). In graph-theoretic \n\napproaches, the habitat patches or populations (nodes) are connected by links, for example, \n\ngeographic distances (Saura and Pascual-Hortal, 2007; Saura and Torn\u00e9, 2009). Nodes are \n\nconsidered connected if the internode distance is lower than, for example, the maximum \n\ndispersal distance of a focal species (that is, structural connectivity). Based on the topology of \n\na network, it is possible to determine the most critical network elements\u2014nodes as well as \n\nlinks\u2014for maintaining the structural connectivity of habitat patches or populations in a \n\nlandscape. Graph theory (Harary, 1977) has been taken from its original mathematical context \n\nand is nowadays applied to many other purposes, such as understanding biological process as \n\nfood webs, community stability and gene networks (Proulx et al., 2005). This approach has been \n\n\n\nChapter 6  \n\n250\t\n\n\t\n\nsuggested as a useful tool in assisting decision making for conservation purposes (Saura and \n\nPascual- Hortal, 2007). The application to landscape ecology is not new (Risser et al. 1984) but \n\nit was not until recently that it started to be used for conservation practices (Jord\u00e1n et al., \n\n2007; Minor and Urban, 2008; Vasas et al., 2009). Despite the increasing application of graph-\n\nbased connectivity metrics in recent years, studies relating these measures to estimates of \n\nfunctional connectivity, such as gene flow, or to genetic diversity, remain scarce (Dyer et al., \n\n2012; Neel, 2008).  \n\nAmphibians are the most endangered vertebrates worldwide (Wake and Vredenburg, \n\n2008). Due to their biphasic life cycle, highly permeable skin and ectothermic physiology, \n\namphibians are very dependent on environmental quality and vulnerable to its change (Niemi \n\nand McDonald, 2004). These specificities, combined with their restricted dispersal ability \n\n(Bowne and Bowers, 2004; Russell et al., 2005), demand an integrated local and landscape-level \n\napproach when planning for amphibian conservation and habitat management. Pond breeding \n\namphibians have reproductive populations associated with ponds distributed over the landscape, \n\nbeing often considered to follow meta-population dynamics (but see Smith and Green, 2005). \n\nThus, landscape connectivity and, specifically, pond connectivity is of extreme importance for \n\nthe long- term persistence of these populations, since it may buffer the stochastic events to which \n\nponds (particularly Mediterranean ponds) are extremely prone (Compton et al., 2007; Cushman, \n\n2005) Amphibians play keystone roles in ecosystem functioning, act as both predators and prey, \n\nenable nutrient transport between aquatic and terrestrial systems and are among the most diverse \n\nand abundant vertebrates, comprising species from a variety of habits, breeding strategies and \n\ndispersal abilities. Hence, the importance of amphibian communities is intrinsically related to \n\nvital ecosystem processes and, consequently, ecosystem resilience and resistance (Davic and \n\nWelsh, 2004).  \n\nIn this study, we applied network analysis to a set of waterbodies whose amphibian \n\ncommunities were sampled, in order to establish the structural importance of each individual \n\nwaterbody to the connectivity of the entire network. With this procedure, we characterize each \n\nwaterbody regarding relative connectivity and corresponding amphibian diversity. The latter \n\nhas previously been related with landscape connectivity (Bailey et al., 2010) and, although, with \n\n\n\n                                            Anuran Functional Connectivity In Rice Crops: A Graph-Theoretic Approach \n\n\t\n\n\t 251\t\n\nconstraints, it is a very straightforward measure of biological response to the environment. Since \n\nconnectivity is not the only parameter that influences suitability of a waterbody for amphibians, \n\nwe added several local waterbody (e.g., percentage of bare ground, herbaceous vegetation, \n\nshrubs and trees, aquatic vegetation) and landscape characteristics (e.g. distance to the closest \n\nwaterbody, total waterbody area and total forest patch area within a 500 m buffer) considered \n\nimportant for amphibians. We intend to assess the relation between each waterbody importance \n\nfor connectivity with those variables, in order to better contribute to more effective management \n\nrecommendations. First, we evaluated whether graph-based estimates of structural connectivity \n\nreflect functional connectivity, measured as anuran taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic \n\ndiversity. Afterwards, we examined the relationship between local and landscape pond \n\ncharacteristics on waterbody importance for connectivity. We hypothesized that forest patch \n\narea and waterbody structural heterogeneity would affect pond importance for connectivity in \n\nthe agricultural matrix.  \n\n\t\n\n6.3 Methods \n6.3.1 Study area and sampling design \n\nThis study took place in an ecotone region between the Amazon rainforest and the \n\nBrazilian savanna, the Cerrado, in the state of Tocantins, Brazil. Sampled rice crops are located \n\nin the municipal district of Lagoa da Confus\u00e3o. The agricultural landscapes of the Cerrado-\n\nAmazon ecotone are characterized by the presence of ipucas, \u201cislands\u201d of closed native \n\nvegetation which remain flooded longer than the surrounding areas. These structures are \n\ncharacterized by the abundance of certain plants (e.g. Calophyllum brasiliense) and presence of \n\nendemic animals (e.g. Rhipidomys ipukensis). Because converting an ipuca into cropland results \n\nin very low crop yields, due to their inherent inappropriateness for agricultural exploration, the \n\nagricultural landscapes of the Tocantins state are quite peculiar, with vast crop areas speckled \n\n\n\nChapter 6  \n\n252\t\n\n\t\n\nby many \u201cislands\u201d of native vegetation of variable dimensions.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.1.

When rice is being grown, from \n\nDecember to April, rice fields remain with surface water until harvest, before which crops are \n\ncompletely drained. After rice harvesting, crops may remain fallow or other crops, such as soy \n\nor watermelon, may be cultivated, depending on the landowner\u2019s will. Besides rice fields, the \n\nregion\u2019s landscape is also occupied by pasture areas, where cows, emus or water buffalos roam.  \n\nIn order to ensure that we represented most of the environmental variability of this \n\nagricultural landscape, a total of 10 rice fields were chosen along the Rio Formoso irrigation \n\nproject (Fig. 6.1). Rice fields varied in size, ipuca abundance and dimensions and waterbody \n\nabundance and size. We selected 3 to 4 lentic waterbodies for anuran sampling in each rice field, \n\ntotalizing 35 waterbodies. Waterbodies were chosen based on type, size and hydroperiod. We \n\nchose small (25 m2) to large (1200 m2) temporary lentic waterbodies.  \n\n \n\n6.3.2 Anuran surveys \n\n Agricultural surveys were conducted during two rainy seasons, from February 2013 to \n\nApril 2014. Anuran sampling was performed using nocturnal visual encounter surveys along the \n\n10 m wide margin of each waterbody, for approximately 30 min. Every individual seen perched \n\non the vegetation, on the floor, under the leaf litter, logs or stones was caught, identified, \n\nmeasured, weighed, photographed and then released near the site of origin. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.3.3 Local waterbodies characteristics \n\nEnvironmental variables such as percentage of bare ground, herbaceous vegetation, shrubs, \n\ntrees, shaded ground, leaf litter, logs/rocks, aquatic vegetation, herbaceous vegetation height, \n\n\n\nChapter 6  \n\n254\t\n\n\t\n\nshrub vegetation height, herbaceous vegetation heterogeneity and shrub vegetation \n\nheterogeneity were registered.  These variables were quantified performing transects (10 m long \n\nx 1 m wide) set on the sampled waterbody margin. For every meter, a 50 cm x 50 cm grid \n\nwould be placed above the ground and the number of squares with 50% or more coverage of \n\neach variable would be summed and divided by the total (25 squares). \n\n \n\n6.3.4 Landscape features \n\nWe quantified landscape structure for each waterbody using Google Earth satellite \n\nimagery representing the landscape of the year 2014 and corroborated the main features on the \n\nfield. For each of the 35 sampled waterbodies, we quantified distance to the closest waterbody, \n\ndistance to the closest forest patch and number of waterbodies, number of forest patches, total \n\nwaterbody area, total forest area, mean forest patch area and mean waterbody area within 500 \n\nm, 1000 m and 1500 m buffers. While compositional features, such as number of forest patches \n\nor total waterbody area describe the proportions of different types of land use within the area \n\nsurrounding a waterbody, configurational features, such as distance to the closest forest patch \n\nor waterbody, specify the geometric arrangement of land features surrounding a waterbody. We \n\nquantified landscape characteristics at three spatial scales (buffers of 500, 1000 and 1500 m \n\nradius) that we found significant for amphibians, regarding known dispersal abilities, to account \n\nfor interspecific differences in anuran dispersal and ability to endure in agricultural systems.  \n\n \n\n6.3.5 Trait Data \n\nWe compiled life history and ecological traits for every anuran species registered in the \n\nagricultural and pristine study areas. For each species we compiled information of 12 traits: \n\nactivity, habits, habitat, fossorial behavior, adult snout-vent length (SVL), breeding site, \n\nbreeding strategy, clutch size, parental care, breeding season, breeding pattern and geographic \n\nrange size. We chose these traits based on perceived importance for determining species \n\nresilience to agricultural activities (Table A1) and on data availability. We compiled trait data \n\nfrom the literature, the AmphibiaWeb and IUCN online databases. If published data were \n\nunavailable, we relied on expert opinion or inferred trait information based on closely related \n\n\n\n                                            Anuran Functional Connectivity In Rice Crops: A Graph-Theoretic Approach \n\n\t\n\n\t 255\t\n\nspecies. Because breeding site, breeding season and breeding pattern were very homogeneous \n\nalong the agricultural anuran community, we decided to exclude these three traits from the \n\nfollowing analyses.  \n\n \n\n6.3.6 Biodiversity metrics  \n\nWe quantified TD at each site, using Simpson\u2019s diversity index (Simpson, 1949), and \n\nFD and PD using Rao\u2019s quadratic entropy (Botta-Duk\u00e1t, 2005). These metrics facilitate \n\ncomparison among these three dimensions because Rao\u2019s Q is an extended form of Simpson\u2019s \n\nindex that includes information on species dissimilarities. Rao\u2019s Q corresponds to the sum of \n\nfunctional or phylogenetic distances between all species, weighted by the product of their \n\nrelative abundances and describes the abundance- weighted average difference among species \n\nfrom a community (Weiher, 2011). Functional and phylogenetic distances between species were \n\nobtained from pairwise dissimilarity matrices for all traits combined and for the phylogeny. \n\nFunctional pairwise dissimilarity matrices were calculated using the Gower distance matrix, \n\nwhich quantifies dissimilarities with categorical and numeric attributes simultaneously (Botta-\n\nDuk\u00e1t, 2005). To promote meaningful comparisons among dimensions, we transformed each \n\nmetric into its effective number of species (Jost, 2007), allowing direct interpretation of \n\ndifferences among indices (Jost, 2007). We calculated FD with function dfFD from package \n\nFD, and PD and TD with function raoD from package picante on program R.  \n\n \n\n6.3.7 Network analysis  \n\nStudies on dispersal ability of amphibians reveal that the maximum walked distance is \n\nvery variable among species (Kovar et al., 2009; Smith and Green, 2005), ranging from 10 to \n\n2000 m. We therefore, established four thresholds: 250, 500, 800 and 1000 m. We then tested \n\nat which threshold the relationship with anuran diversity lost significance. For each threshold \n\nand diversity metric, we calculated node importance for connectivity of the entire pond network. \n\nWe used correlation analysis to relate the waterbody importance for connectivity to the diversity \n\n\n\nChapter 6  \n\n256\t\n\n\t\n\nmetrics of the pond-breeding amphibians.  \n\nNodes were characterized by three diversity metrics (TD, FD and PD), and links \n\nwere represented using Euclidean distances between meta-populations. Species richness has \n\npreviously been related with landscape connectivity (Bailey et al., 2010) and used to assess pond \n\nnetwork connectivity for amphibians (Ribeiro et al., 2011). Although with constraints, it is a \n\nvery reliable measure of biological response to the environment. We used taxonomic diversity, \n\nbut also functional and phylogenetic diversity to assess pond connectivity, as both FD and PD \n\nconstitute more accurate representations of anuran diversity, dispersal constraints and more \n\nthorough guidance for management actions.  \n\nTwo graph-based connectivity indices, the integral index of connectivity (IIC) and the \n\nprobability of connectivity (PC), have been shown to perform best for the purpose of \n\nprioritization of habitats and links (Saura and Pascual-Hortal, 2007; Saura and Torn\u00e9, 2009). \nWe chose IIC for evaluating the importance of each waterbody for connectivity. IIC ranges \n\nbetween 0 and 1 and is defined as:  \n\n!!\" =\n$%$&amp;\n\n1 + )*%&amp;\n\n+\n\n&amp;,-\n\n+\n\n%,-\n \n\n \n\nwhere n is the total number of nodes in the landscape, ai and aj are the attributes of nodes i and \n\nj and nlij is the number of links (distances) between nodes i and j. IIC is based on a binary \n\nconnection model that means that two nodes are either considered connected or not depending \n\non the actual distance between them in relation to the predefined distance threshold. In \n\nCONEFOR 2.6, the prioritization of each node for maintaining landscape connectivity is \n\ncalculated as the percentage of the variation of IIC resulting from the removal of a given node \n\nfrom the landscape:  \n\n.* % = 100\u00d7! ? !345674!  \n\n\n\n                                            Anuran Functional Connectivity In Rice Crops: A Graph-Theoretic Approach \n\n\t\n\n\t 257\t\n\n \n\nwhere I is the overall index value (IIC) for all initially existing nodes in the landscape, and \n\nIremove is the overall index value after the removal of a given node from the landscape. To \n\nestimate the effects of landscape variables on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity \n\nas a measure of functional connectivity, we used Euclidian distance, and the local and landscape \n\nvariables for each waterbody.  \n\n \n\n6.3.8 Quantitative analyses  \n\nWe performed generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to examine the effects of \n\nlocal and landscape features on waterbody connectivity considering TD, FD and PD as anuran \n\ndiversity metrics.  \n\nBecause the 1000 and 1500 m buffers used to characterize the surroundings of each \n\nwaterbody included other waterbodies within the same rice field, we used rice field as random \n\neffect. Random effects are especially useful for inferring on a population when the data available \n\nare random samples of that population, assuming it is a meta-population, and that our sample \n\nreflects many draws from that population. So rather than anchoring results around \n\nheterogeneous intercepts, the data will be used to elucidate the parameters of that distribution \n\nfrom which data were drawn. \n\nModel fit for each dependent variable was manually assessed from the null model, to \n\navoid automatic variable elimination for the sake of model fit optimization only. We choose to \n\nassess model fit and predictor significance through F-tests performed among nested models for \n\nconnectivity described by FD, PD and TD. We progressively evaluated each predictor\u2019s \n\nsignificance, and then fitted reduced models with the most significant predictors, finally \n\nassessing the reduced models\u2019 fit against the full model, using F tests. We fit all models using \n\nthe lme4 package (Bates 2007). \n\nWe performed hierarchical partitioning (HP) to further determine the relative \n\nindependent importance of each significant variable. We determined the statistical significance \n\n\n\nChapter 6  \n\n258\t\n\n\t\n\nof each independent variable\u2019s independent contribution using a randomization approach with \n\n5000 iterations and an alpha- level of 0.05 (Mac Nally, 2002). We executed hierarchical \n\npartitioning using package \u2018hier.part\u2019 (MacNally &amp; Walsh, 2004). \n\n \n\n6.4 Results \nThe effects of structural graph-theoretic connectivity measures on taxonomic, functional \n\nand phylogenetic diversity were different but consistent. Depending on the distance threshold \n\nconsidered, we detected significant correlations between node importance and estimates of \n\ndiversity. TD was significantly correlated to node importance considering the 250, 500 and 800 \n\nm thresholds (r250=0.81, p-value = 3.721e- 09; r500=0.81, p-value=3.721e-09; r800=0.64, p-\n\nvalue=3.291e-05). FD was significantly correlated to node importance in the 250 and 500 m \n\nthresholds (r250=0.51, p-value = 0.001705; r500=0.51, p-value = 0.001705). PD was \n\nsignificantly correlated to node importance considering three thresholds (r250=0.66, p-value = \n\n1.812e-05; r500=0.66, p- value = 1.812e-05; r800=0.55, p-value = 0.000608).  \n\nLocal variables were important predictors of node importance regarding taxonomic, \n\nfunctional and phylogenetic diversity (Table 6.1). Regarding TD and PD, node importance \n\ndecreased with increasing shaded ground. Regarding FD, node importance increased with \n\nincreasing abundance of shrubs and trees in the waterbody margin.  \n\nThe most important landscape predictors of node importance were also consistent. \n\nNumber of forest patches, total forest area and mean waterbody area in the vicinities of the \n\nwaterbodies were the most important predictors of node importance for connectivity regarding \n\nthe three diversity metrics used (Table 6.1). Regarding TD, waterbody importance increased 7% \n\nwith total forest area and number of forest patches (Fig. 6.2A, B). Regarding FD, node \n\nimportance increased 83% with increasing mean waterbody area in the vicinities of the \n\nwaterbodies (Fig. 6.2C). Regarding PD, node importance increased 8% with increasing number \nof forest patches and total forest area in the vicinity of each waterbody (Fig. 6.2D, E).  \n\n\n\n                                            Anuran Functional Connectivity In Rice Crops: A Graph-Theoretic Approach \n\n\t\n\n\t 259\t\n\nThe most significant predictors for the GLMM models were in agreement with the HP \n\nresults (Table 6.1), which determines the independent contribution from each predictor.  \n\n \n\nDiversity \nmetricthreashold \n\nLocal predictors Hierarchical \npartitioning \n\n(%) \n\nLandscape  \npredictors \n\nHierarchical \npartitioning \n\n(%) \n\nTD250 \n\n- - \n\nTotal forest area  \n(1000m) \n\n52.16 \n\n Mean waterbody area \n(500m) \n\n13.14 \n\n \nNumber of waterbodies \n(500m) \n\n12.27 \n\nTD800 \n\nShaded ground 22.65 Number of forest patches \n(1000m) \n\n32.40 \n\nLeaf-litter 19.38 Number of waterbodies \n(1000m) \n\n26.22 \n\nBareground 17.87 Mean waterbody area \n(500m) \n\n13.34 \n\nFD250 \n\nShrubs &amp; Trees 44.50 Mean waterbody area \n(500m) \n\n26.77 \n\nLeaf-litter 31.40 Total forest area  \n(1000m) \n\n13.49 \n\nHerb. vegetation 12.87 Total forest area  \n(1500m) \n\n9.60 \n\nPD250 - - \n\nTotal forest area  \n(1000m) \n\n38.60 \n\nMean waterbody area \n(500m) \n\n20.45 \n\nDistance to the closest   \nwaterbody \n\n9.78 \n\nPD800 \nShaded ground 19.56 Number of forest patches \n\n(1000m) \n30.56 \n\n Leaf-litter 20.01 Number of waterbodies \n(1000m) \n\n22.79 \n\n Bareground 21.96  11.45 \n\nTable 6.1.

The adoption of TD, FD and PD as proxies for functional connectivity is based on \n\nthe premise that more accessible sites will host more species, traits and lineages, considering \n\nhabitat suitability is equal. Regarding TD, the most accessible waterbody will host more species. \n\nRegarding FD, more traits will be represented in a waterbody widely accessible to the trait \n\nensemble of the local community. Regarding PD, more lineages will be represented in the most \n\naccessible waterbodies.  \n\nNode importance depends on amphibian functional connectivity, in this case represented \n\nby anuran diversity metrics. Given that diversity metrics also represent habitat suitability, as \n\nmore species will breed successfully in more suitable waterbodies, functional connectivity may \n\nbe overestimated if those factors related to habitat quality are not accounted for. Hence, we \n\nregressed node importance measured according to the three proxies of functional connectivity \n\nagainst local habitat and landscape variables. Functional connectivity can only be affected by \n\nspecies intrinsic dispersal ability or by landscape features.  \n\n Amphibian functional connectivity within this agricultural landscape was positively \n\nrelated to node importance at distance thresholds between 250 and 800 m, depending on the \n\nmetric used. The relation of the landscape connectivity with anuran diversity metrics is \n\nunambiguous, indicating that the accumulation of amphibian species, traits and lineages in \n\nbreeding ponds is, even if partially, related to the spatial position of the pond in relation to the \n\nother ponds nearby. Our results corroborate those found by Cunningham et al. (2007) and \n\nRibeiro et al. (2011). In fact, according to Cunningham et al. (2007), wetland connectivity is the \n\nbest variable in distinguishing wetlands with high amphibian species richness from those with \n\nlow species richness. Although species richness is an elementary measurement of regional \n\ndiversity and extremely useful in conservation planning, it could be misleading and simplistic, \n\nas accounting only for species number leaves important community and ecosystem-level \n\n\n\nChapter 6  \n\n262\t\n\n\t\n\nparameters unassessed. For example, in this study the maximum distance threshold at which \n\nstructural and functional connectivity were correlated was 500 m regarding trait diversity (FD) \n\nand 800 m regarding taxonomic and phylogenic diversity. This means that if traits related \n\nto low dispersal ability were represented by only one or two species that are unable to disperse \n\nbeyond 500 m, they would not be represented in waterbodies beyond that threshold. However, \n\nthis absence would probably not be translated into significantly lower taxonomic or \n\nphylogenetic diversity, which illustrates the importance of taking more that a single avenue to \n\nreach conclusions on the effects on anthropization of biodiversity.  \n\n Pond breeding amphibians typically exist in local populations associated with discrete \n\nbreeding pools. With low dispersal ability and the potential for asynchronous dynamics among \n\nlocal populations, meta-population dynamics may play an important role in long-term \n\npopulation persistence (Gamble et al., 2007; Semlitsch, 2002; Smith and Green, 2005), \n\nespecially in unstable anthropogenic landscapes. Hence, conservation efforts limited to the \n\nprotection of individual pools may be ineffective over the long term if connectivity among pools \n\nis not maintained (Gibbs and Shriver, 2005; Gibbs, 1993). Indeed, maintaining and enhancing \n\nspatial connectivity among fragmented natural and semi-natural habitats is one of the main \n\nchallenges for ecological management and conservation biology. However, although the \n\nstructural properties of landscapes are widely used as indicators of biodiversity in practical \n\nlandscape planning, they may not have a straightforward effect on functional connectivity, i.e., \n\nthe way each species responds to landscape structure (Tischendorf and Fahrig, 2000). In this \n\nstudy, we used several local and landscape variables and a graph-theory based index to assess \n\nwhich features are more determinant for increasing waterbody importance for connectivity in a \n\npond network embedded in an agricultural landscape. We found that total forest patch area and \n\nabundance within 1000 m from a waterbody, and mean waterbody area within the 500 m from \n\na waterbody, were the most important predictors of node importance for connectivity.  \n\n The importance of forest fragments for dispersal in anthropogenic landscapes has been \n\nidentified before. Janin et al. (2009) found that the landscape matrix strongly influenced toad \n\noccurrence, with forests and meadows causing low resistance to toad movement, and crops \n\nposing intermediate to high resistance to toad movement. Popescu and Hunter (2011) found \n\n\n\n                                            Anuran Functional Connectivity In Rice Crops: A Graph-Theoretic Approach \n\n\t\n\n\t 263\t\n\nclear-cuts to be significant barriers to amphibian dispersal, altering the movements of emigrating \n\njuveniles from waterbodies. The low permeability of clear-cuts and other open-canopy habitats \n\nto juvenile amphibian movement has been previously recorded (Rothermel and Semlitsch, 2002; \n\nRothermel, 2004). Hence, promoting the persistence of amphibian populations in anthropogenic \n\nlandscapes must involve the preservation or creation of forest habitats adjacent to breeding sites \n\n(Todd et al., 2009).  \n\nAlthough our approach of network analysis followed the simplest model (euclidean \n\ndistance and no weighing of the different ponds), and cannot be generalized to other cases \n\nwithout caution, our results suggest that in order to maximize pond network connectivity for \n\namphibians in rice crops we must ensure that abundant and large forest patches are present in \n\nthe vicinities of the waterbodies, and that we must create or preserve a network of abundant \n\nwaterbodies.  \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nWe would like to thank two anonymous reviewers and an editor, whose opinions and \n\nsuggestions much contributed to the improvement of this manuscript.

Effects of anthropization on the Cerrado anurans \n The Cerrado is currently under major anthropogenic pressure and the limited \n\nknowledge available on the biome\u2019s biodiversity is evident; new species are constantly being \n\ndescribed and large portions of the biome have never been adequately sampled. Unfortunately \n\nthis poses a very clear impairment on the development of effective management and \n\nconservation plans. \n\n The anurofauna of the Cerrado has a series of ecophysiological traits that may \n\nrender them more resistant to anthropic disturbances than Neotropical forest anurans. \n\nCharacteristic fossorial habits and specialized breeding structures such as foam nests might in \n\nfact be responsible for the increased resistance of some Cerrado anurans in disturbed habitats, \n\nsuch as crops and pastures. However, much like what has been acknowledged in other biomes, \n\nanthropogenic areas are dominated by widespread, generalist species. Hence, although crops \n\nand pastures can harbor a seemingly diverse anuran community, there will be a strong \n\ndominance by resilient species, favoring generalists and excluding anuran specialists. \n\nNonetheless, natural vegetation fragments, earthen irrigation channels and shallow depressions \n\nthat support perennial ponds and aquatic vegetation appear to be important landscape features \n\nfor promoting the use of rice fields by anurans.   \n\n The massive and omnipresent use of agrochemicals in the Cerrado is bound to act \n\nsynergistically with crop and pasture setting and management. In fact, the scarce studies \n\navailable identified pesticides on living tissue of generalist species, which may indicate that \n\neven these seemingly resilient species have low fitness. Furthermore, chytridiomycosis has \n\nalso been recorded in many species extant in the biome, including Cerrado endemics. Given \n\nthe declines this disease is known to cause, it may be causing severe unacknowledged \n\ndeclines. \n\n The Cerrado anurofauna appears to be especially sensitive to the development of \n\nhydroelectric projects, as even previously common, widespread and generalist species \n\ndeclined or disappeared after flooding.  \n\n Latest predictions indicate that the occupation of the Cerrado will proceed \n\nnorthwards, dramatically reducing the proportion of remaining natural habitats, in synergy \n\nwith climate change, leading to a great loss of biodiversity. Only a small portion of suitable \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n\t 272\t\n\nnatural habitats will remain in northern Cerrado, with amphibian richness being reduced to \n\nless than half. Future climate changes will be especially detrimental for endemic anurans, with \n\nsmall potential current distribution.  \n\n This review allowed me to conclude that, contrary to widespread belief, the \n\nbiodiversity of the Amazon is not the only one enduring aggressive threats in Brazil. The \n\nanurofauna of the Cerrado is under an unacknowledged high extinction risk and in urgent need \n\nof more scientific studies and conservation and management projects. It is urgent to direct the \n\nattention to the Brazilian savanna. The scientific community must help establish the Cerrado \n\nas a valuable biome with major ecological importance. Detailed demographic and community-\n\nlevel studies on Cerrado amphibians are badly needed, namely abundance and diversity \n\nstudies for adult, juveniles and larvae/eggs.  \n\n \n\n7.2.  Conservation priorities for the anurofauna of the Cerrado \nIn spite of the broad and aggressive character of the anthropogenic conversion of the \n\nBrazilian Cerrado, species do not respond equally to the same threats. The most vulnerable \n\nanurans in the Cerrado are a highly non-random subset of the anurofauna, composed of lotic \n\nbreeders and habitat specialists with small clutches, large body sizes and small geographic \n\nranges. Specialization has been associated to increased susceptibility to environmental change. \n\nVariables describing direct human impacts apparently had no effect on extinction risk, perhaps \n\nbecause populations of threatened species may have already been extirpated from the most \n\ndisturbed habitats before assessments occurred (Cardillo et al., 2005; Tingley et al., 2013) or \n\ndetrimental effects of anthropogenic activities have such broad, across species consequences, \n\nthat end up being detrimental to all species.  \n\n This particular study demonstrates that the extinction risk of amphibians worldwide \n\nmay be severely underestimated, especially in scarcely studied and highly anthropic biomes. A \n\nlarge proportion of species predicted as sensitive and/or decreasing is currently listed as LC or \n\nDD by the IUCN Red List. Given the difficulties intrinsic to studying amphibians, adopting \n\npredictive integrative trait-based approaches may give us insight into \u201caccidents waiting to \n\nhappen\u201d and help prioritize regions for scientific projects or conservation actions. \n\n\n\nGeneral discussion and conclusions \n\n\t 273\t\n\n The center of the Cerrado is the biome\u2019s main hotspot for high extinction-risk anurans \n\nand about 70% of the anuran species considered are major conservation gaps, while only 29 \n\nspecies are adequately protected. Hence, not only the extinction risk of the Cerrado \n\nanurofauna appears severely underestimated, but also the current PA network is insufficient to \n\nprotect at least 50% of the minimum area required for ensuring the protection of 141 species. \n\n This study underscores the importance of adopting more specific and integrative \n\napproaches to extinction risk, considering species ecology and landscape metrics to better \n\nguide conservation and management policies. The cost-effective and integrative approach we \n\npresented may be of special value for biodiverse regions, with strong anthropogenic pressure, \n\nbut weak government support and scarce funding for conservation actions. Brazil is currently \n\nexperiencing extremely high economic demands and, after long decades of raising public \n\nawareness to the importance of protecting the Amazon rainforest, other biomes have been \n\ntargeted to fulfill social and economic pressures. Frameworks such as ours may shed light into \n\nwhich areas and species need more protection and what is the minimum protection each \n\nspecies needs to endure.  \n\n \n\n7.3. Neotropical anuran communities from rice crops \n Habitat conversion and agricultural management caused profound alterations to the \n\nanuran community of a Cerrado-Amazon ecotone area, with dramatic loss of species diversity \n\nand functional richness and increase in functional divergence. Community composition \n\nsuffered severe alterations, resulting in dominance of generalist hylids and leptodactylids and \n\nlow representation of specialist microhylids and bufonids. Anuran communities in rice fields \n\nexhibited decreased phylogenetic diversity and mean phylogenetic distance, and increased \n\nmean nearest phylogenetic distance, suggesting that anuran communities in agricultural areas \n\nare composed of a few phylogenetically related species and, therefore, not as diverse as their \n\npristine counterparts. \n\n Functional and phylogenetic diversity indices provide deeper insights into the complex \n\neffects that disturbances have on biodiversity (Cornwell et al., 2006). Functional richness in \n\nparticular has been invoked as a good predictor of ecosystem services because it describes \n\nspecies traits and represents the capacity of each species to provide a particular service (D??az \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n\t 274\t\n\nand Cabido, 2001). Our study corroborates such conceptions because, although anuran species \n\nrichness, functional richness and phylogenetic diversity were significantly lower in rice fields, \n\ntaxonomic diversity did not vary significantly. Amphibians play keystone roles in ecosystem \n\nfunctioning; in food webs, they act as both predators on invertebrates and small vertebrates \n\nand as prey for larger animals, establishing an avenue for nutrient transport between aquatic \n\nand terrestrial systems. Loss of amphibian functional richness and increased functional \n\ndivergence may affect vital ecosystem processes and contribute to loss of system resilience \n\nand resistance (Davic and Welsh, 2004). \n\n Understanding how species traits correlate with their responses to agriculture will \n\nallow better predictions of the functional effects of anthropogenic land-use (Newbold et al., \n\n2013). Diversity itself is an important component of ecosystem resilience because diverse \n\ncommunities are more likely to hold multiple species capable of contributing to a single given \n\nfunction. Small geographic ranges, association with forest and open area habitats, small \n\nclutches and large body size were associated with low to null species abundances in rice fields. \n\nHowever, our results show that the conversion of natural Cerrado-Amazon vegetation to vast \n\nrice fields results in such environmental stresses, that large subsets of species are driven to \n\nlocal extinction irrespective of their specialization. Species commonly perceived as resilient to \n\nhabitat alteration did not occur in these environments (e.g. Leptodactylus labyrinthicus, Heyer, \n\n2005), which indicates that the new environmental filters, arisen as a consequence of replacing \n\nnative vegetation with rice fields, are more detrimental on Neotropical anurans than expected. \n\n Anuran biomass, phylogenetic diversity, functional diversity, and specific trait \n\ndiversity were positively influenced by the presence and abundance of landscape features such \n\nas waterbodies and forest patches. These metrics increased with decreasing distance to the \n\nclosest waterbody and increasing waterbody abundance and forest patch area. Hence, these \n\nlandscape features are crucial for maintaining more diverse anuran communities in agricultural \n\nlandscapes.  \n\n The lower body condition observed in frogs from cultivated sites is an indication that \n\nthese animals have reduced fitness and suggests that ecologically relevant parameters such as \n\nreproductive output and survival may be impaired in these populations (Brodeur et al., 2011). \n\n\n\nGeneral discussion and conclusions \n\n\t 275\t\n\n Meta-population theory, the source-sink concept and adaptations of island \n\nbiogeography theory all stress that habitat patches vary in their capacity to maintain \n\npopulations (due to variation in their size, resources, microclimate, etc.), and that a subset of \n\npatches may be pivotal to network viability (Whittaker and Fern\u00e1ndez-Palacios, 2007). Indeed, \n\nmeta-population persistence in fragmented landscapes depends on the ability of habitat \n\npatches to support resilient local populations and sufficient connectivity between patches. \n\nAmphibians are frequently characterized as having limited dispersal abilities, strong site \n\nfidelity and spatially distant breeding habitat. Investigating how landscape structure influences \n\namphibian populations is crucial, and measuring connectivity has been recognized as critical \n\nto the study of fragmented populations. We found that forest patch area and abundance, as \n\nwell as waterbody area, were the most important predictors of waterbody importance for \n\nconnectivity. Although our approach of network analysis followed the simplest model, and \n\ncannot be generalized to other cases without caution, our results suggest that in order to \n\nmaximize pond network connectivity for amphibians in rice crops we must ensure that \n\nabundant and large forest patches are present in the vicinities of the breeding sites, and that a \n\nnetwork of abundant waterbodies must be preserved or even created. \n\n Anuran communities in crops have considerable economic potential, acting as pest \n\ncontrol and contributing to increased crop yield. We believe the patterns we detected on \n\nanuran communities are of the utmost importance for managing agro-ecosystems, especially in \n\nthe Neotropics, where agricultural expansion is unrelenting and biodiversity especially high \n\nand unique. \n\n Local diversity, a proportion of regional richness (e.g. Holt et al., 2002; Meatyard, \n\n2005), can be expected to be lower in agroecosystems than in natural ecosystems, because of \n\ntheir high disturbance levels. In fact, crop fields have been described as \u201cdefaunated islands, \n\nrelying on colonization from the regional species pool\u201d (Tscharntke et al., 2005). Managing \n\nsuch disturbed ecosystems depends on a diversity of source populations in the surrounding \n\nlandscape, which assure the resilience of the systems for sustainable use (Folke et al., 1996). \n\n Although organic farming has been often touted as the solution for ensuring \n\nbiodiversity preservation in crops, landscape context is also important (Bengtsson et al., 2005). \n\nIn fact, the species pool of the landscape from which local communities are drawn may be \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n\t 276\t\n\neven more important than the difference between organic and conventional agriculture, For \n\nexample, Schmidt and Tscharntke (2005) and Schmidt et al. (2005) found the diversity of \n\nspiders to increase with landscape complexity, but not farming system. The negative impact of \n\nintensive farming may happen only in simple landscapes, with little colonization from the \n\nsurrounding areas, whereas complex landscapes appear to mitigate the effects of actions \n\nassociated to the management of intensively grown crops. Hence, in simple agricultural \n\nlandscapes, such as vast rice crop areas, local habitat creation or management changes may be \n\nimportant for reducing isolation from sources of colonizers, thereby improving ecosystem \n\nservices (see Bengtsson et al., 2003).   \n\n \n\n7.4. Management guidelines and implications \n Brazil is currently facing extremely high economic demands, which reinforces the need \n\nfor thorough, viable and cost-effective conservation and management actions.  \n\n I recommend the protected areas\u2019 network of the Cerrado to be revised to include \n\npristine regions still remaining in the center of the biome, as this is the region with the largest \n\nconcentration of high extinction anurans, major conservation gaps and strongest anthropogenic \n\npressure. In simple landscapes, such as vast monocultures, local habitat creation or \nmanagement may be the solution to reducing isolation from sources of colonizers and improve \n\necosystem services. In concrete, maintaining or creating a network of abundant waterbodies \n\nand large forest patches is crucial for sustaining more functionally and phylogenetically \n\ndiverse anuran communities in these anthropogenic landscapes. Furthermore, earthen \n\nirrigation channels and shallow depressions that support perennial ponds and aquatic \n\nvegetation are other important features for promoting the use of rice fields by anurans.   \n\n \n\n7.5. Future research  \n Given the current economic pressure to converting the Cerrado into a massive \n\nagricultural area, the scientific community must make a definite effort to try to preserve what \n\nis still left from the world\u2019s largest and most diverse savanna. This effort should involve \n\ndeveloping more conservation plans, improving the protected areas network and respective \n\n\n\nGeneral discussion and conclusions \n\n\t 277\t\n\nmanagement. However, this is highly dependent on acquiring more knowledge on the \n\nbiodiversity of this biome and on the threats that human activities pose. The northernmost \n\nportion of the biome has been especially disregarded by scientific projects and is now being \n\ntargeted for agricultural development. \n\n Beyond studies on natural history, conserving and managing the actual anthropogenic \n\nCerrado will require more studies on the effects that human activities have on the biome\u2019s \n\nbiodiversity. This thesis underscores the importance of adopting more integrative approaches, \n\nconsidering species ecology and landscape metrics to better guide conservation and \n\nmanagement policies.  \n\n \n\n7.6.
