Optimization and Comparison between Polymer, Surfactant-\n\nPolymer and Water Flooding Recoveries in a Pre-salt Carbonate Reservoir \n\nConsidering Uncertainties. 2019. 156 p. Dissertation (Master\u2019s degree) \u2013 Mining and \n\nPetroleum Engineering Department of the Escola Polit\u00e9cnica of the University of Sao \n\nPaulo, Sao Paulo, 2019. \n\nA successful Chemical Enhanced Oil Recovery (CEOR) program starts with a proper \n\nprocess selection for a given field, followed by a formulation of the batch components \n\nand a representative simulation step. Also, lab studies, field data, pilot testing, and \n\neconomic analyses are required before project implementation. This work discusses \n\nthe state of the art of the Surfactant-Polymer flood (SP) EOR technique, specifically for \n\ncarbonate reservoirs, and states a methodology mixing laboratory, literature and \n\nreservoir simulation, to assess its applicability under economic and geological \n\nuncertainties. First, it is explained concepts related to the research, such as polymer, \n\nsurfactant, microemulsion, functionalities of each chemical injected, advantages, and \n\ndisadvantages. Second, a state of the art is developed about recent SP advances. \n\nThird, it is described the laboratory method being used to evaluate some properties of \n\nthe chemicals injected for the Polymer flooding (PF) and SP flooding. Later, the \n\nsimulation study step being conducted is explained, which will define the volume \n\nrecovered and Net Present Value (NVP) obtained for the PF, SP injections and water \n\nflooding, in different economic and geological scenarios for two models resembling \n\ncarbonate Brazilian reservoirs. Finally, it is discussed the results obtained, future \n\nresearches that could be performed, and the respective bibliography. As part of this \n\nresearch, it was verified the Xanthan gum shows adequate results at different \n\nconcentrations; that a surfactant specifically selected for a carbonate rock with low \n\nInterfacial tension and low adsorption is required; also that for the Lula based model \n\nalthough the polymer flooding and Surfactant-Polymer simulation brought some \n\nbenefits, when compared with the waterflooding, on different economic scenarios and \n\ngeological models, the high cost associated to the chemical handling facilities and \n\nvolume spent do not make favorable its application in any scenario. On the contrary \n\nfor the Cerena I field model, it was found the SP and Polymer flooding on all cases \n\nbrought better results when compared with the water injection. Concluding that the \n\nperformance and success of a CEOR program require finding the correct slug \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\ncharacteristics for the unique conditions of each reservoir. In this research the reservoir \n\nwith higher production rates made possible the use of Chemical EOR presenting better \n\nresults than a water injection however in the smaller model they were not economically \n\nviable due to the additional associated prices.  \n\nKey Words:  Enhanced Oil Recovery, Surfactant-Polymer, Polymer, Carbonate \n\nReservoir, Particle Swarm Optimization, Expected Monetary Value\n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nRESUMO \n\nGARCIA VILLA, J.

Adicionalmente, testes laboratoriais, dados de campos, testes pilotos \n\ne an\u00e1lises econ\u00f4micas s\u00e3o necess\u00e1rias antes da implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de um projeto. Este \n\ntrabalho discute o estado da arte da t\u00e9cnica de recupera\u00e7\u00e3o melhorada de petr\u00f3leo \n\n(EOR) pela inje\u00e7\u00e3o de surfactante-pol\u00edmero (SP), especificamente para reservat\u00f3rios \n\ncarbon\u00e1ticos e, utilizada uma metodologia baseada em dados de laborat\u00f3rio, literatura \n\ne de simula\u00e7\u00e3o de reservat\u00f3rio para avaliar sua aplicabilidade sob incertezas \n\necon\u00f4micas e geol\u00f3gicas. Primeiramente, s\u00e3o explicados conceitos necess\u00e1rios a \n\neste trabalho relacionados com pol\u00edmero, surfactante, microemuls\u00e3o, funcionalidades \n\nde cada produto qu\u00edmico injetado, vantagens e desvantagens. Em segundo lugar, um \n\nestado da arte \u00e9 desenvolvido sobre os avan\u00e7os recentes do SP. Ap\u00f3s, descreve-se \n\nos m\u00e9todos laboratoriais utilizados para avaliar algumas propriedades dos produtos \n\nqu\u00edmicos usados nas inje\u00e7\u00f5es de Pol\u00edmeros (PF) e SP.  \n\nPosteriormente, \u00e9 explicada a etapa do estudo de simula\u00e7\u00e3o, que definir\u00e1 o volume \n\nrecuperado e o valor presente l\u00edquido (NVP), obtidos para inje\u00e7\u00f5es PF, SP e \u00e1gua, em \n\ndiferentes cen\u00e1rios econ\u00f4micos e geol\u00f3gicos, para dois modelos semelhantes a \n\nreservat\u00f3rios carbon\u00e1ticos brasileiros. Por fim, s\u00e3o discutidos os resultados obtidos, \n\nsugest\u00f5es de trabalhos futuros e apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o da bibliografia. Como parte desta \n\npesquisa, verificou-se que a goma xantana apresenta resultados consistentes em \n\ndiferentes concentra\u00e7\u00f5es e que \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio um surfactante especificamente \n\nselecionado para uma rocha carbon\u00e1tica, possuindo baixa tens\u00e3o interfacial e baixa \n\nadsor\u00e7\u00e3o. Para o modelo baseado em Lula, embora a simula\u00e7\u00e3o de inje\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\npol\u00edmero e surfactante-pol\u00edmero tenham trazido alguns benef\u00edcios, quando \n\ncomparados com a inje\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua, em diferentes cen\u00e1rios econ\u00f4micos e modelos \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\ngeol\u00f3gicos, o alto custo associado \u00e0s instala\u00e7\u00f5es de manipula\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica e volume \n\ngasto n\u00e3o favorece sua aplica\u00e7\u00e3o em qualquer cen\u00e1rio. Por outro lado, no modelo de \n\ncampo Cerena I, verificou-se que as inje\u00e7\u00f5es de SP e de pol\u00edmero, em todos os casos, \n\ntrouxeram melhores resultados quando comparadas com a inje\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua. \n\nConcluindo, o desempenho e o sucesso de um programa de CEOR exige encontrar \n\nas corretas caracter\u00edsticas de slugs para condi\u00e7\u00f5es \u00fanicas de cada reservat\u00f3rio. Neste \n\ntrabalho, o reservat\u00f3rio com maiores taxas de produ\u00e7\u00e3o infere que o m\u00e9todo qu\u00edmico \n\nde EOR apresente melhores resultados quando comparado com a inje\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua. \n\nPalavras-chave: recupera\u00e7\u00e3o melhorada de petr\u00f3leo, surfactante-pol\u00edmero, pol\u00edmero, \n\nreservat\u00f3rio carbon\u00e1tico, Otimiza\u00e7\u00e3o por Enxame de

INTRODUCTION \n\nDuring the primary and secondary oil recovery phase, as a result of an inefficient \n\nmacroscopic sweep and a microscopic capillary entrapment, the residual oil is found \n\nin the reservoir as a discontinuous volume of droplets which can reach up to 70% of \n\nthe original oil in place (HIRASAKI; MILLER; PUERTO, 2011), leaving in average only \n\none third of crude acquirable with conventional techniques. Therefore, one of the \n\nbiggest challenges the oil industry has encountered is to increment the global efficiency \n\nof oil recovery on mature reservoirs worldwide. Regarding EOR methods, the objective \n\nis to mobilize the residual oil by increasing the capillary number (Nc), which describes \n\nthe ratio of viscous to capillary forces (CHO et al., 2018). \n\nSince the higher the Nc, the lower the residual oil saturation (STEGEMEIER, \n\n1977; AMRAN et al., 2017), the residual saturation on the reservoir strongly depends \n\non the relationship found on the capillary number (Nc) equation,  \n\n?? =  \n??\n\n?\n (1) \n\nWhere ? is the fluid velocity, ? is the displacing fluid viscosity, and ? is the \n\ninterfacial tension between displaced and displacing fluids. Regarding this equation, \n\nthe increase of oil recovery can be achieved in three different ways: the first one would \n\nbe an increase of displacing fluid viscosity, affecting the macroscopic sweep, but not \n\nthe microscopic sweep. The second one would be a reduction of interfacial tension \n\nwhich does impact the microscopic sweep efficiency, possible with interfacial tension \n\nreducers and the third is by increasing the velocity of the fluid on the porous media \n\n(FARAJZADEH et al., 2012). \n\nBetween the enhanced and improved recovery methodologies being employed \n\nto increase the hydrocarbon recovery, it can be found a diverse selection of techniques \n\nin which chemical EOR methods (CEOR) are well established. The more well-known \n\nprocesses are polymer flood, surfactant flood, alkaline flood and any mix from the \n\nprevious ones such as the alkaline-surfactant flood (AS), the alkaline-surfactant-\n\npolymer flood (ASP) and the surfactant-polymer flooding (SP). Processes where \n\npolymer has as main function to provide mobility control by viscosifying the water; the \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nsurfactant reduces the interfacial tension and alter the rock wettability; and the alkaline \n\nreacts with the oil acids, generating an in-situ soap, which will provide an additional \n\nsource for rock wettability alteration and a minor need of adding synthetic surfactant in \n\nthe slug (CHANG et al., 2006; AYIRALA; YOUSEF, 2015). \n\nHowever, although CEOR methods had an important growth in the 1980s, they \n\nare highly sensitive to oil prices and the chemical additive costs, if compared with other \n\nmethodologies such as  waterflooding, CO2 injection, steam injection and water \n\nalternating gas (MANRIQUE; MUCI; GURFINKEL, 2007b). The techniques require \n\nfinding the correct slug characteristics for the unique conditions of each reservoir. \n\nVariables such as chemical concentration, water ratio, ions presence, flow rate, and \n\nothers influence the production program (OLAJIRE, 2014; SHENG, 2014). Moreover, \n\nchallenges on field scale applications are also encountered: (1) operational difficulties, \n\n(2) surfactant precipitation, (3) difficulties in treating produced emulsions, (4) produced \n\nwater disposal treatment, and (5) sole challenges of offshore application (OLAJIRE, \n\n2014; SHENG, 2014). \n\nThere has been little report studying the SP injection on carbonate reservoirs, \n\nsome authors when constructing screening parameters, do not include these type of \n\nrock formations, or even the SP injection because of the difficulties previously \n\nmentioned. As an example, Dickson (2010) do not include the SP injection, Taber \n\n(1997) and Al Adasani (2011) proposed screenings recompiling several parameters \n\nfrom other authors, where they recommend sandstones as reservoir rocks. The fact  \n\nthere is little report of field scale application on SP flooding, strictly speaking (no alkali \n\ninjection), most of them were done before 1990, none in Latin America and only four \n\napplications on carbonate reservoirs successfully carried out in the literature between \n\n1970 to 2018 (FOSTER, 1973; MILLER; RICHMOND, 1978; WKFMNYER, 1982; \n\nTALASH; STRANGE, 1982; THOMAS et al., 1982; RATERMAN, 1990; HOLLEY; \n\nCAYLAS, 1992; BOU-MIKAEL et al., 2000; MANRIQUE; MUCI; GURFINKEL, 2007a; \n\nZHU et al., 2012; ZHENQUAN et al., 2013; SHENG, 2013a; AL-AMRIE et al., 2015). \n\nIn consideration of these conditions and the previously mentioned challenges, \n\nthe oil industry in offshore basins and carbonate reservoirs requires designs of SP \n\nprograms with the following characteristics: (1) chemicals usable in adversary reservoir \n\nconditions, (2) designs flexibles for carbonate reservoir rocks, (3) divalent tolerable \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nchemicals, pre-salt conditions are over 50.000 ppm (BELTRAO et al., 2009), (4) \n\nsurfactants with lower precipitation tendency (with divalent ions), (5) single formulation \n\nfor different field requirements, and, (6) chemicals with less environmental effects \n\n(OLAJIRE, 2014; AL-SINANI et al., 2016). \n\nTherefore, defining the applicability of SP flooding as an alternative for a \n\nBrazilian carbonate formation requires studying a program containing surfactant and \n\npolymer injection. In this research, a preliminary selection of products available is \n\ndiscussed, considering the rock properties and formation fluids. Secondly, it is \n\nevaluated the laboratory information and literature data which is used on the simulation \n\nphase based on the requirements of a carbonate reservoir with conditions like an \n\noffshore pre-salt field. \n\nThe simulation study was carried by using two synthetics 3D reservoir models \n\nresembling the Jupiter Field and Lula Field. The former was related to the CERENA I, \n\na synthetic model benchmark built by the CERENA Institute (MADEIRA, 2014) \n\nbecause resembles some of the common characteristics of a Brazilian Pre-Salt \n\ncarbonate (medium oil, high CO2 content, and high pressures) with a microbiolite \n\nreservoir and a non-reservoir facies. The latter was obtained and adjusted from \n\nliterature data also for the Brazilian pre-salt. An evaluation of two models was selected \n\nto evaluate how, despite being two Brazilian offshore reservoirs, their characteristics \n\ndiffer between each other such as temperature, PVT model, wettability, pressure, and \n\nCO2 content. \n\nThe inputs information for the simulation study regarding some physical-\n\nchemical parameters from the selected chemicals were obtained from the laboratory \n\nexperimentation for the polymer (xanthan gum) and literature review for the surfactant \n\n(zwitterionic type). Concerning the surfactant, available laboratory screening tests \n\nwere carried out in some available materials to guide the choice of the literature \n\nsurfactant data for the simulation input. For all cases, a high salinity scenario was \n\nconsidered, as conditions over 50000 ppm chloride content are observed in the field \n\n(BELTRAO et al., 2009). \n\nAfter analyzing the results, it is discussed if it is viable or not the injection of SP \n\nas a possible Chemical-EOR technique for further studies on Brazilian offshore \n\nconditions.\n\n\n\n4 \n \n\n \n \n\n1.1.

To evaluate the technical and economic performance of a chosen SP \n\nformulation in a numerical simulation of a synthetic 3D reservoir model with an \n\ninverted five-spot scheme resembling the Lula Field. \n\n? To evaluate the technical and economic performance of a chosen SP \n\nformulation in a numerical simulation of a synthetic 3D reservoir model with an \n\ninverted five-spot scheme resembling the Jupiter Field.\n\n  \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\n \n \n\n2. FUNDAMENTALS \n\nOn an SP flood, the polymer has as primary function providing mobility control, \n\nwhile the surfactant reduces the interfacial tension between water and oil phases, \n\nimproving the final oil recovery on the reservoir. However, it presents disadvantages \n\nsuch as low permeability pore plugging, high costs either by manufacturing or storage \n\nand treatment facilities, high instability in harsh conditions (such as high salt \n\nconcentration and high temperature) and mechanical degradation of the polymer \n\n(SRIVASTAVA et al., 2009). Reasons why finding alternatives and improving the \n\nperformance of this injection, has been crucial. Next, it is relevant to introduce some \n\nkey concepts for the SP flooding, the object of this work. \n\n2.1. SURFACTANT (S)  \n\nAn amphiphilic compound, with two functional groups, where the first is \n\nhydrophilic and the second one is hydrophobic, containing then: a water-insoluble tail \n\nand a water-soluble head (OLAJIRE, 2014), an example on Figure 2.1-1. \n\nFigure 2.1-1 Schematic of a surfactant structure. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019. \n\nSurfactants can be classified as anionic, cationic, nonionic, and zwitterionic \n\naccording to the ionic nature of their head group. The anionic surfactants have a \n\nnegative charge and are more widely used for EOR projects on sandstone reservoirs. \n\nCationic ones have a positive surface-active portion and low adsorption on carbonate \n\nreservoirs but are expensive. Nonionic surfactants have no apparent ionic charge, are \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\n \n \n\nmore tolerable to high salinity, but they don\u2019t reduce the IFT as good as the other types, \n\ntherefore are employed as cosurfactants to improve the phase behavior system. \n\nZwitterionic have both ionic charges, have strong electrolyte tolerance (therefore salt \n\ntolerance), are thermodynamically stables, but they are not that extensively studied as \n\nthe other types of surfactants (ROSEN, 2004; SHENG, 2013b). \n\nThe main objective of surfactant use on the batch is to reduce the interfacial \n\ntension (IFT) between the water and the oil, recovering, in that way, the residual oil \n\ntrapped on the pores of the rocks. When the oil encounters the chemical batch, the \n\nsurfactant accumulates between the fluids contact interface and it forms an adsorbed \n\nlayer, which reduces the IFT. This one allows the dispersed oil droplets to be swept \n\nand produced. \n\nLevitt et al., (2009, 2016) mentioned the formulation requirements for a \n\nsurfactant being employed in an EOR method: \n\n? The surfactant solubilization ratio ? 10 (explained in the microemulsion \n\nsection); \n\n? Low viscosity microemulsion phase with low apparent macroemulsion; \n\n? A transparent solution at reservoir temperature (no oil addition conditions); \n\n? Low adsorption on the rock surface.  \n\n2.2. POLYMER (P) \n\nA polymer is a long chain molecule formed by the joining of smaller molecules \n\ncalled monomers, which results in a high molecular weight (KASIMBAZI, 2014). It is \n\nemployed in EOR methodologies to increase the sweep efficiency of the injected fluid \n\nby reducing the mobility ratio defined as: \n\n? =\n????\n\n????\n (2) \n\nWhere M, ??, ?? ??, and ?? are mobility ratio, water and oil relative permeability \n\nat the endpoints and oil and water viscosity, respectively. The polymer, when \n\nincorporated on the water injection, increases the viscosity of the displacing fluid, \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\n \n \n\nreaching then closer values to one (1), which is defined as a controlled process (Rosa, \n\nCarvalho, &amp; Xavier, 2006).  \n\nSheng, Leonhardt and Azri (2015) describe the sweep efficiency increasing \n\nbecause of reducing viscous-fingering, improving the displacing fluid injection profile \n\ndue to crossflow between vertical heterogeneous layers and longest permeability \n\nreduction after the flooding of the solution containing polymer. In Figure 2.2-1 can be \n\nobserved an example of the areal sweep efficiency of a water injection compared with \n\nthe one obtained with a polymer injection for an inverted five spot model. Figure 2.2-1a \n\nshows a simplified aerial view of how the water channels in the reservoir resulting in \n\nlower recovery efficiencies, while Figure 2.2-1b resembles the polymer flooding which \n\nreduces fingering issues and reaches a larger area than the first by having a more \n\nhomogeneous front. \n\nFigure 2.2-1 Areal sweep efficiency of (a) water and(b) polymer injections. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019. \n\nTwo main types of polymers are employed in chemical EOR methodologies \n\n(CEOR), synthetic polymers such as partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) and \n\nbiopolymers such as Xanthan gum and Scleroglucan (SHENG, 2011; \n\nKULAWARDANA et al., 2012; KASIMBAZI, 2014; MOHAMID et al., 2015). The HPAM \n\nis the most widely used because of its low costs and larger viscoelasticity than other \n\npolymers; however, it is susceptible to the brine salinity and hardness (OLAJIRE, \n\n2014). On the other hand, biopolymers and specifically Xanthan gum are relatively \n\ninsensitive to salinity and hardness, but their main disadvantage is their susceptibility \n\nto bacterial degradation (KASIMBAZI, 2014). Examples of these polymer structures \n\ncan be observed in Figure 2.2-2 and Figure 2.2-3. \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.2-2 Polyacrylamide and Hydrolyzed Polyacrylamide \u2013 HPAM chemical \n\nstructures. \n\n  \n\nSource: OLAJIRE, 2014. \n\nFigure 2.2-3 Example of a Xanthan gum chemical structure. \n\n \n\nSource: OLAJIRE, 2014.  \n\nAccording to Levitt et al. (2009, 2016) a polymer solution for an EOR method \n\nmust meet the following parameters: \n\na. Aggregates low or free polymer solution to ensure there are no particles capable \n\nof plugging the formation (indicated by a filter ratio test); \n\nb. Acceptable injectivity in the reservoir; \n\nc. Stable at reservoir temperature and ionic composition over a reservoir-\n\nresidence timescale. \n\n2.3. MICROEMULSION TYPES \n\nThe Winsor classification (Winsor, 1954) identifies four general types of phase \n\nequilibrium for the microemulsion. On type I, the surfactant is preferentially water \n\nsoluble, and the microemulsion is oil in water (o/w). In this case, the rich-surfactant \n\nwater phase coexists with the oil phase, where the surfactant appears in the form of \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\n \n \n\nmonomers at low concentration. On type II, the surfactant appears mainly on the oil \n\nphase and the microemulsion formed is water in oil (w/o), in which, the surfactant-rich \n\noil phase coexists with the poorest aqueous phase. On type III, a triphasic system is \n\ngenerated where the intermediate phase rich on surfactants, coexist with the water and \n\noil phases, both with a low surfactant concentration. Finally, in type IV, one micellar \n\nsolution phase appears, which is formed when there is enough addition of an \n\namphiphilic volume. In Figure 2.3-1 can be observed the schematic of how each \n\nmicroemulsion (ME) type behaves according to the previously discussed. \n\nFigure 2.3-1 Schematic examples of microemulsion phase behavior types \n\naccording to Winsor classification. \n\n \n\nSource: SHENG, 2011. \n\nTechnically, type III is preferred, because it reaches an ultra-low IFT between \n\nthe microemulsion phase and the water and oil-rich phases (equal or less than \n\n1?10?3 ??/? for successful solubilization and oil recovery). It sweeps the remaining \n\noil as one unified bank with little entrapment of the microemulsion phase, which means \n\nthat there will be a larger area swept by the surfactant and a bigger volume of chemistry \n\nrecovered on the surface facilities. Attention must be taken to the optimal salinity \n\nranges where the type III microemulsion can be reached, meaning that it can be \n\nconsidered a crucial factor in a surfactant-based flood.  \n\nThe solubilization ratio of oil is the ratio of the volume of solubilized oil to the \n\nvolume of surfactant present (Vo/Vs), and the solubilization ratio of the water is \n\ncalculated following the same concept for the water volume (Vw/Vs). The optimal \n\nsalinity can be defined as the point where the solubilization ratios Vo/Vs and Vw/Vs are \n\nequal (ZHANG et al., 2006). Huh (1979) proposed that for a classical Winsor III \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\n \n \n\nbehavior the solubilization ratios between the microemulsion phase and excess oil and \n\nbrine phases respectively were defined as, \n\n??? = ? (\n??\n\n??\n)\n\n2\n?   (3)   ??? = ? (\n\n??\n\n??\n)\n\n2\n?   (4) \n\nWhere c is a constant for each system, ??? and ??? are the interfacial tension between \n\nphases on a Winsor type III microemulsion. This way, the IFT of the mixture (water, oil \n\nand surfactant) can be calculated based on experimental data of solubilization ratios. \n\n2.4. CRITICAL MICELLE CONCENTRATION  \n\nAs the concentration of a surfactant increases, molecules start to interact with \n\neach other and organize aggregates of larger numbers of molecules called micelles. \n\nIn these, the lipophilic parts will associate in the interior of the aggregate, and the \n\nhydrophilic parts will face the aqueous medium. The concentration at which the \n\nmolecules start to interact, and form micelles is called critical micelle concentration \n\n(CMC), and over its value, the surface tension will not be reduced any further. It \n\ndepends highly on the surfactant type, while it has a smaller dependence on pressure \n\nand temperature (SCHRAMM; MARANGONI, 2001; BENT, 2014; LASKARIS, 2015). \n\nThe surfactant effectiveness can be defined as how much the surface \n\ntension/interfacial tension can be reduced until reaching the CMC in the mixture. \n\nTherefore, it\u2019s a parameter which characterizes the surfactant and relates the IFT \n\nbehavior, making its evaluation a detail to observe (CRAFT; ABDELRAHIM, 2012). \n\n2.5. PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION \n\nAn optimization method was used in this research, the Particle Swarm \n\nOptimization algorithm (PSO), which will be later mentioned in the methodology \n\nsection. The PSO is a global optimization method developed by Kennedy and Eberhart \n\n(1995) which can be explained by the behavior of bird flocks, where individual adjusts \n\nits fly vector according to their individual and the companion's experiences. In it, each \n\nPSO candidate, or particle, represents a D-dimensional space, being D the number of \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\n \n \n\nparameters to be optimized (KEMMO\u00c9 TCHOMT\u00c9; GOURGAND, 2009). Hence, the \n\nposition of the particle and the population or swarm of N candidate\u2019s solutions can be \n\ndescribed as \n\n?? = [??1, ??2, \u2026 , ??? ]     (5) \n\n? = [?1, ?2, \u2026 , ??}     (6) \n\nWhile an optimal solution is searched, the particles update their position \n\niteratively based on the next relation: \n\n??,?+1 = ?1??,? + ?2?1(??,? ? ??,? ) + ?3?1(??,? ? ??,? )   (7) \n\nwhere, ??,? it\u2019s the velocity vector associated to the particle, t and t+1 are two \n\nconsecutive iterations of the algorithm, ??,? it\u2019s the best solution so far by the particle, \n\n??,? it\u2019s the global best solution of the swarm, ?1 are random diagonals matrices of \n\nrandom numbers from a uniform distribution from 0 to 1 and ?1, ?2, ?3are constants \n\nmodulating the magnitude of the steps taken by a particle in the direction of its personal \n\nand global best solution.   \n\n2.6. EXPECTED MONETARY VALUE \n\nAccording to Fraser and Seba (1993), the expected monetary value (EMV) \n\ncombines quantitative probabilities (estimates) with each alternative element \n\nevaluated. This parameter is defined as the sum of the product of the probability of \n\neach outcome times the value of that outcome for all possible outcomes, so for this \n\nresearch purposes:  \n\n??? = ? ? ??????? ? ?? ? ??   (8) \n\nwhere ???? it\u2019s the optimal Net Present Value for each possible case and ??  its \n\nthe probability that of each the NPV\u2019s will occur. \n\nThe expected monetary value is used in this research to quantify the economic \n\nperformance of the injection programs: waterflooding, polymer flooding, and \n\nSurfactant-Polymer flooding.  \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\n \n \n\n3. STATE OF THE ART \n\nAs described previously in the introduction, the benefits of both components \n\non the SP method have a synergistic effect that may help to reach higher recovery \n\nfactors on adequate production fields. However, the Surfactant Polymer flood is a \n\nCEOR method traditionally employed only in sandstone reservoirs and it has been \n\nless studied than ASP and Polymer floodings (TABER et al., 1997; MANRIQUE; \n\nMUCI; GURFINKEL, 2007b; ROMERO-ZER\u00d3N, 2012; ZHU et al., 2012; OLAJIRE, \n\n2014; SHENG, 2014).   \n\nManrique et al. (2007) briefly explained that, although CEOR methods had an \n\nimportant growth in the 1980s, they are highly sensitive to oil prices and the chemical \n\nadditive costs, if compared with other methodologies such as WAG, waterflooding, \n\nCO2 flood. Moreover, they possess several issues to overcome, as described next. \n\nOlajire (2014) resumes five challenges to overcome in order to put an ASP \n\nproject in a field scale application, which can be extrapolated to an SP program: (1) \n\noperation difficulties, (2) surfactant precipitation, (3) difficulties in treating produced \n\nemulsions, (4) produced water disposal treatment and (5) sole challenges of offshore \n\napplication. Meanwhile Zhu et al. (2012) describes five: (1) lack of high efficient and \n\nstable industrial surfactants, (2) lack of understanding on the oil displacement \n\nmechanism of the technique, (3) imperfect evaluation method, reflected in a non-\n\nexisting standard methodology, (4) few pilot tests performed in history and (5) high \n\ntechnological risk. These difficulties limit the SP applicability and selection in a \n\npreliminary screening stage, but also bring forward the future developments that \n\nmust be carried to make it attractive in other non-traditional scenarios.  \n\nThere are few reports of field scale application on SP flooding, strictly \n\nspeaking, alkali-free. Chauhan (2014) on his research reported 42 SP/Micellar \n\nPolymer flooding projects carried out worldwide until 2014, based on the Oil &amp; Gas \n\nJournal biennially report, however, most of these projects are only mentioned on the \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\n \n \n\nliterature without further description of them. From this total, only 3 of the 33 projects \n\non the U.S were performed on carbonate reservoirs, according to Manrique et al. \n\n(2007). Additionally, two more recent projects can be added to this list, the Illinois \n\npilot  (IZADI et al., 2018), and the Middle East pilot performed by Total S.A on an \n\noffshore carbonate reservoir (MOREL et al., 2016) summing up 44 projects.  \n\nFrom these projects mentioned previously, Sheng (2011), Zhu et al. (2012) \n\nand Manrique (2007) describe 12 of these projects, and they can be defined as the \n\nprojects more documented in the literature. From this, it can be concluded: (a) most \n\nof them were done before the 1990s; (b) there are only four applications on \n\ncarbonate reservoirs found in the literature, (c) there has not been any pilot or field \n\ndevelopment reported in Latin America; and (d) there is only one offshore project \n\naround the world. Some of these pilots are discussed next, including laboratory and \n\nsimulation studies on carbonate rocks, high salinity brines and CEOR optimizations \n\non reservoir simulation models. The overall distribution of these projects can be \n\nfound in Figure 3-1. \n\nFigure 3-1 SP projects Worldwide status. \n\n \n\nSource: MANRIQUE; MUCI; GURFINKEL, 2007; MOREL et al., 2008; SHENG; \n\nSHENG, 2011; ZHU et al., 2012; CHAUHAN, 2014; IZADI et al., 2018; LI et al., \n\n2018 \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\n \n \n\nNext, will be introduced some field implementations, laboratory applications and \n\nsimulation research relevant to this study as a guide for the work developed.  \n\n3.1. LABORATORY TESTS OF SP FLOODING ON HIGH SALINITY AND/OR \n\nCARBONATE RESERVOIRS  \n\nFor the Bramberge reservoir in Germany, it was studied in the laboratory the \n\nuse of an SP program with high salinity production brine, using adsorption inhibitors \n\n(TABARY et al., 2012). This onshore sandstone reservoir has high permeability, \n\naveraging 1 Darcy, low temperature (40\u00b0C), crude oil of 28.6 API, a water cut close \n\nto 95%, formation water salinity of 120 g/L and an injection brine with a TDS of 25-\n\n43 g/L. Their research focused on testing the performance of the SP program on \n\ndifferent brine conditions, including diluting, brine treatments, and inhibitors. They \n\nconcluded that despite softened water (low hardness) and its mixing can help the \n\nperformance of the SP injection on a high salinity brine formation, the treatment \n\nprocesses required to achieve the softening makes these alternatives challenging to \n\nimplement on field conditions. Concluding, of these alternatives the mixture including \n\nadsorption inhibitors was the one with the best results, as it obtained similar \n\nrecoveries as the other alternatives and moreover the adsorption was reduced 50% \n\nto 70% when compared to the conventional solutions. These results showed the \n\nviability of a high salinity SP, an opportunity on unconventional scenarios. \n\nZaitoun et al. (2003) reported a study for the Chihuido field in Argentina of SP \n\nflooding at a laboratory scale for high salinity brine. The formation brine salinity \n\nmoves close to 110.000 ppm and around 2.800 ppm TDS, which can be considered \n\nas high salinity in a sandstone formation. The rock has a porosity moving between \n\n9 to 27 % and an average permeability of 45mD up to 400 mD, a light oil, 33 to 35 \n\nAPI, and 55\u00b0C. An anionic surfactant for IFT reduction and a sacrificial surfactant \n\nwere evaluated on three experiments: coreflooding, static, and dynamic adsorption. \n\nThe primary and sacrificial surfactant concentration was 0.125%w for each one of \n\nthem, and it was obtained a final recovery of 36%, the lowest IFT measured was of \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\n \n \n\n0.0036 mN/m and adsorption for the primary surfactant of 0.048 mg/g-rock. The \n\nstudy concluded that it is possible to use and SP injection on high salinity formations, \n\nwith low surfactant concentrations and moderate adsorption on the rock. \n\nZhu et al. (2013) reported an ASP and SP laboratory study on a \n\nheterogeneous biostromal carbonate reservoir from Indonesia KS oilfield. The \n\nresearch focused on evaluating and comparing the adsorption of different \n\nsurfactants and polymers and their performance under coreflooding. Five different \n\npolymers were evaluated between polyacrylamides and biopolymers, eleven \n\nsurfactants, including amphoteric, anionic, cationic and non-ionic types, two alkali \n\nagents, sodium carbonate and sodium phosphate, and a crude oil sample with a \n\nTAN of 0.09 mg KOH/g. From this research can be highlighted that: (1) the best \n\nperformance on the chemical slug was provided individually by the specially \n\nmanufactured polymers (HPAM) with heat and salt resistances; (2) the ASP with a \n\nweak alkali and the SP flooding had similar oil recoveries over a water injection \n\nmeaning that the presence of the alkali can be eliminated on a chemical flooding of \n\nthese characteristics; (3) the amphoteric surfactant had one of the best performance \n\non both injection programs ASP and SP and its adsorption was of 0.41 mg/g \n\nconsidered a viable loss on the reservoir during dynamic conditions. \n\nLater Levitt et al. (2013), evaluated on a laboratory scale the challenges of \n\nSP flooding in a low permeability carbonate with high temperature and salinity \n\nconditions. The methodology consisted of the selection of polymer and surfactants, \n\nto later evaluate their performance on different core plugs: limestones, sandstone, \n\nand original reservoir cores. The results pointed out that: (1) there was emulsion \n\nproduction while at the same time a build-up pressure was encountered on \n\nlimestones, which did not appear on sandstones, a possible reason was the \n\nformation of in-situ macroemulsion or capillary pressure in the same order of \n\nmagnitude as the low gradients in the coreflooding test; (2) on laboratory scale exists \n\na dispersity effect only obtained on original reservoir core plugs, which affects the oil \n\nbank formation of the SP flooding directly, resulting in lower recovery factors than \n\nthe expected (a solution may be the use of longer cores); (3) the predictions of the \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\n \n \n\ncapillary desaturation curves are not representative of laboratory data, which \n\nreaches oil recoveries over 90%, a possible reason is oil solubilization rather than \n\nmobilization of the trapped oil. \n\nAlso, there have been researches employing chemical for the SP flooding \n\nfrom a biological origin. Hongyan et al. (2016) studied the performance of a betaine \n\nsurfactant derived from an oleic acid product of vegetable oil and later compared \n\nwith two surfactants. The study was carried out in a sandstone rock at 85\u00b0C, \n\ncontaining a low salinity brine 1270 mg/L and crude oil of 36 API gravity. Among the \n\ntests results, it can be highlighted that the interfacial tension reached desirable \n\nvalues, 1x10-3 mN/m, and this was conserved even after 90 days; showing the \n\nefficiency of the biosurfactant. The remaining saturation of coreflooding test was \n\nmeasured using Dean-Stark apparatus and a Soxhlet Extractor. The incremental \n\nrecoveries for two runs of an SP slug were of 16.03% and 14.43% for medium and \n\nhigh permeability sandstone cores respectively.  \n\nAnother research regarding biochemicals for SP flooding was done by Saudi \n\nAramco, where a biosurfactant, four biopolymers, and one HPAM polymer were \n\ntested in carbonate reservoir sample (ALANIS et al., 2015; ALZAHID et al., 2016). \n\nThe fluids were a crude oil of 30 API, formation brine of 229 g/L TDS and an injection \n\nbrine of 57 g/L TDS, while the rock samples had an average porosity of 19.6% and \n\n26.1 %. The surfactant had low adsorption of 0.65 mg/g, 0.04 mN/m at a 0.2wt% \n\nconcentration which did not change drastically after long thermal exposure at \n\nreservoir conditions and resulting in an incremental recovery of 17%. From the five \n\npolymers, three of them were pre-selected after the compatibility test with the \n\nformation brine, a Xanthan gum, a Diutan gum, and a HPAM benchmark not \n\ndisclosed. Both biopolymers reached the viscosity target despite some affecting by \n\nthe salinity of the brine, the filtration ratio was acceptable for a polymer concentration \n\nof 0.1wt%. However, with lower values the filtration was higher than the ones \n\nobtained with the benchmark; regarding the long-term stability, the Diutan gum \n\nrequired higher concentrations as to obtained in the similar long-term characteristics \n\nas the benchmark while the Xanthan gum maintained its properties. Finally, the \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\n \n \n\nbiopolymers adsorption was lower than the one encountered in the benchmark, and \n\nthe SP coreflooding test had similar results as the HPAM but slightly lower, obtaining \n\nin an SP flooding 15.5% of incremental recovery only 2.5% lower than the \n\nbenchmark. These results showed that it is feasible using biopolymers and \n\nbiosurfactants for chemical EOR programs and that they can achieve good results. \n\nLater, Levitt et al. (2016) reported the following step of the previous research, \n\nwhich was the evaluation of SP formulation for the Middle East pilot. The formulation \n\nwas designed and optimized by performing close to 5000 microemulsion pipette \n\ntests, more than forty coreflooding tests, and several thermal stability evaluations as \n\nto find the best mixture of chemicals. The main requirements for the chemical \n\nformulation were high salinity and high-temperature tolerance, field injectivity, \n\nstability at reservoir conditions, and chemical retention on an economic level. The \n\nreservoir conditions were 83\u00b0C, formation brine salinity of 258 g/l, and a carbonate \n\nrock with 1 to 200 mD. The final formulation contained a manufactured surfactant on \n\nTotal Research labs, and it was an Ethanol ester sulfonate and partially hydrolyzed \n\npolyacrylamide polymer with calcium and temperature tolerance. Such chemical \n\nbatch obtained on coreflooding tests residual oil saturation of 1 to 8%, which proved \n\neconomically viable. \n\nA laboratory study was performed by Jabbar et al. (2017) to evaluate the \n\napplicability of an SP and ASP flooding on an offshore giant carbonate field in the \n\nMiddle East development plan for CEOR injection, which could have pilot \n\ndevelopment on 2018-2019. This research had two objectives: (1) Identifying a \n\nchemical formulation stable at high salinity (~200000 ppm TDS), low permeability \n\n(<10 mD) and high temperature conditions (100\u00b0C), found on this reservoir; (2) \n\nevaluating this formulation performance on coreflooding test with representative \n\ncrude oil and rock samples. During this laboratory phase, thermal stability, polymer \n\nrheology, and microemulsion phase behavior were evaluated. From the evaluated \n\npolymers, despite salt resistance and adequate rheology results, their thermal \n\nstability did not show the long thermal stability necessary. On the other way, the \n\nphase behavior tests (more than 100 were carried out), found optimal formulations \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\n \n \n\nwith high optimal salinities, for the SP 63000 ppm TDS and the ASP 57000 ppm \n\nTDS, the surfactants were large hydrophobe alkoxy carboxylate and sulfonates. \n\nFinally, the coreflooding results were encouraging, with a final recovery for the SP \n\ninjection of 97% and 93.5 for the ASP, however more studies were decided as to \n\nimprove the high surfactant adsorption which was considered not economically \n\nviable. \n\n3.2. OFFSHORE STATUS \n\nOn the literature as described previously, the number of SP projects is not \n\nlarge, and there has been only one report of SP flooding implementation in an \n\noffshore reservoir. In this section is described some offshore ASP projects which can \n\nserve as a reference of the challenges a mixed chemical flooding at offshore \n\nconditions can encounter, and their corresponding performance.  \n\nOn the Bob Slaughter Block (ADAMS; SCHIEVELBEIN, 1987; MANRIQUE; \n\nMUCI; GURFINKEL, 2007b), there were reported two pilots of SP flooding in the \n\n\u201980s specifically in the San Andres dolomite reservoir. The reservoir has an average \n\ndepth of 5000 ft and 109\u00b0F, it had a crude oil of 31\u00b0API, and it was under water \n\ninjection 21 years approximately when two SP pilots were performed. Both \n\nconfigurations consisted of two-well patterns, and their formulations consisted of the \n\ninjection of petroleum sulfonates and a biopolymer. The first pilot began at April \n\n1981, and it had a mixture of petroleum sulfonate and alkyl ether sulfate, injected on \n\na period of 171 days and a displacing batch of polymer solution mixed with fresh \n\nwater for almost 140 days, having a final recovery of 77%. The second pilot had a \n\nformulation of petroleum sulfonate and an alkyl ether sulfate, injected by 61 days \n\nand later a polymer slug for 45 days, with a final recovery of 43% considered \n\npromising. \n\nThe Sabiriyaj Mauddud carbonate reservoir, in North Kuwait under waterflood \n\ndevelopment, was screened at the 2000s for EOR techniques that were possible to \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\n \n \n\nimplement. A six steps program was carried out to find the most adequate \n\ntechnology to be implemented: (1) sector model simulation, evaluating competing \n\nEOR processes, (2) laboratory studies on surfactant and polymer floods, (3) \n\nUTCHEM simulation, replicating lab results, (4) migration from UTCHEM results to \n\na 3D sector model, (5) fine grid simulation study for the pilot area and (6) Single Well \n\nChemical Tracer tests (SWCT). During the first step, it was found that an SP injection \n\nwas favorable and could increase 41%the recovery factor. In the second step, it was \n\nestablished the most effective chemical formulation for the rock and reservoir fluid \n\nsamples, using those results as input for the phases 3 to 5. Later, the SWCT was \n\ncarried out, for this, it was selected the wells with assuring the most representative \n\nand with better benefits. The SWCT consists shortly of soaking some meters of the \n\nformation with the chemical formulation and keeping it closed for some days, later \n\nback producing the well which recovers higher volumes of oil due to the chemicals \n\nin contact with the formation. Preliminary it was obtained an increment of 20% of oil \n\nrecovered. Due to the results of the laboratory, simulation phase, and the SWCT, an \n\ninverted five spot model was planned to be carried out in 2016/2017 (ZUBARI; \n\nSIVAKUMAR, 2003; CARLISLE et al., 2014; ABDULLAH; TIWARI; PATHAK, 2015; \n\nFORTENBERRY et al., 2016). \n\nRegarding offshore applications of ASP projects, Chaco et al. (2003) describe \n\nthe design of an ASP system for La Salina Field, Venezuela and, although there are \n\nno reports of application, it is worth noticing that it was a complete study covering \n\nfrom laboratory design, numerical simulation and facilities design for an offshore \n\nfield. A sandstone reservoir presenting a medium gravity crude oil of 25\u00b0API, 18000 \n\nft depth, with a history production of more than 60 years and a water injection plan \n\nof more than 20 years. On the laboratory phase, 23 surfactants, two alkalines \n\n(sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate) and five partially hydrolyzed \n\npolyacrylamide polymers were evaluated with softened water and crude oil from the \n\nfield (a Total Acid Number \u2013 TAN of 0.56 mg KOH/g). In this lab phase fluid \n\ncompatibility, interfacial tension screening, phase behavior, polymer rheology, \n\nadsorption behaviors, and radial coreflooding tests were performed to obtain the \n\noptimal chemical injection for the reservoir formation (La Rosa). The final formula \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\n \n \n\nconsisted of 0.75%w/w of Na2CO3, 0.1%w/w alkyl aryl sulfonate and 800mg/l HPAM. \n\nRegarding the numerical simulation, a history match for waterflooding (real field \n\ndata) and chemical flooding (radial corefloods and fluids data) was performed for 24 \n\nwells (producers and injectors) considering different forecast. The injection order \n\nwas first waterflooding, later ASP solution, followed by a polymer drive, and lately \n\nwater. All estimates got an incremental oil production of at least 31%. About the \n\nfacilities design, it was considered a three years pilot, having as main construction \n\nrequirements: (1) a dissolving, mixing and injection plant according to the chemical \n\nvolume need planned on the laboratory phase, (2) a water treatment plant, (3) an \n\nappropriate tubing array to transport the mixture from plant to injectors and (4) the \n\noffshore platform with capacity to hold the ASP and water treatment plants. Their \n\nmain conclusions were: (1) the oil recovery increment in the laboratory was \n\nsignificant, (2) fluids behavior and screening tests are required as primordial for the \n\neconomic viability of the pilot, (3) the numerical simulation showed good \n\nperformance of the ASP method for different well scenarios and (4) the design and \n\nconstruction of the offshore plant must follow the recommendations of the lab and \n\nsimulation results. \n\nThe St Joseph offshore field in Malaysia is another offshore ASP system \n\nproject found in the literature (CHAI et al., 2011; DU et al., 2011). The pilot study \n\nwas focused on reservoirs containing a medium gravity oil and a chemical injection \n\nusing an already existing waterflooding project from which facilities could be reused. \n\nThe evaluation was performed on a numerical simulation basis, where both polymer \n\nand ASP flood were evaluated versus the water injection program already done (with \n\ngas injection). For the chemical EOR parameters, such as IFT, adsorption, and \n\nrheology, some generic set was used and later, a sensitivity study brought the \n\npolymer constraints, chemical slug size. A previously 3D model history matching was \n\nemployed for the evaluation and run on a Shell in-house reservoir simulator. \n\nAdditionally, some redevelopment activities were simulated: (1) rim infill wells to \n\naccelerate oil production and improve project economics, (2) stopping of oil migration \n\ninto attic region (reduced by gas injection stopping and increasing pressure by fluid \n\ninjection). The corresponding increment in Recovery Factor by infill wells was 7%, \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\n \n \n\npolymer 13%, and ASP 20%. On their study, they describe the equipment required \n\nto implement, on a full field scale, and resembles the one mentioned previously for \n\nLa Salina field. Moreover, some risks and challenges associated with the EOR \n\ntechnique and the offshore implementation were: (1) logistical challenges related to \n\nthe supply chain of chemicals, (2) operators require training regarding the EOR \n\nmethod, (3) the waterflood infrastructure is relatively old, so rejuvenation and \n\nintegrity maintenance is needed, (4) emulsion handling and disposal, including back \n\nproduced chemicals on the facilities, (5) chemical discharge associated to produced \n\nwater, (6) high adsorption of chemicals, (6) localized heterogeneities affecting the \n\nobjective observation of the results, (7) unconstrained fracture growth on the rock \n\n(more viscous fluid injected) and (8) measuring the saturation of oil accurately on the \n\nobservation well during the pilot phase. \n\nA joint Shell and PETRONAS evaluation of the technical challenges of \n\nimplementing an ASP flooding in three offshore producing fields in northern Borneo \n\nwith a focus on space solution (KOVALEV et al., 2016). For it, four anchor cases \n\nwere detailed and analyzed: (1) high injection, (2) medium injection, (3) low injection, \n\nand (4) only polymer. For the first case, the chemical delivery system was based \n\nonshore, with a water intake for the water treatment plant from the nearshore area \n\nand the ASP mixture prepared and transported to injection points by pipelines. The \n\nsecond was based on a floater concept, where the chemicals are supplied from \n\nmanufacturers to the Chemical Delivery System and stored in a vessel hull. The third \n\nwas based on two injection hubs; the first only focused on one field and a second \n\nsupplying the chemicals to the other two. The fourth case was based solely in \n\npolymer reducing costs, intermediate chemical storage onshore, and ASP mixture \n\ndelivered only for two fields and no cocktail injection on the third one. For all three \n\nfields were fixed alkaline, polymer and co-solvent, while the surfactant may vary \n\nbetween fields. A simulation phase was performed using geological and fluid models, \n\nto understand and evaluate the field dynamics, production profiles, and injection \n\nrates using the in-house reservoir simulator MoRes. Regarding the facilities scope, \n\nthe two focuses were the Chemical Delivery System (CDS) and Produced Fluid \n\nHandling, the first treats and prepares ASP mixture while the second one break \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\n \n \n\ndowns the emulsion and treats oil and water. The CDS brought to the analysis the \n\nnecessity of higher power demand (which means that a fuel source is needed, either \n\ngas or other), a pneumatic conveying system to load/offload the chemicals required \n\nand a structure and weight capacity increase. The production facilities must handle \n\nthe presence of chemical back produced, which will affect the performance of the \n\nsurface facilities by forming very stable microemulsions, polymer viscosifying the \n\nproduced water, foam generation by residual surfactant and chemical toxicity. \n\nConcluding, new technologies regarding water treatment, capable of reducing water \n\nand energy consumption; a single chemical formulation is preferable, so no \n\nadditional storage facilities are needed, currently polymer makes 10% of the \n\nchemical cost, while surfactant and alkaline cover the other 90% which brings cost \n\nissues deepen if the design does not cover the possible adsorption of the chemicals \n\non the rock.  \n\nAnother field test was performed by Total S.A in the Middle East in 2014, \n\nwhich was the first offshore pilot on an offshore carbonate reservoir with high salinity \n\nformation brine of 230g/L, high temperature (80-90\u00b0C) and low permeability ranging \n\nfrom 30-100 mD (AL-AMRIE et al., 2015; MOREL et al., 2016). The formulation \n\nemployed consisted of an SP slug of 1.35%w active surfactant in an 80 g/l brine and \n\na polymer drive with softened seawater. The well configuration selected was a one-\n\nspot, after evaluating time for drilling (not required), workovers (only one needed), \n\npilot duration (30 days), relative costs and overall complexity (confinement and no \n\nplatform difficulties). Despite the laboratory design, there were risks which could \n\nresult in the failure of the project or its modification accord to the planes and \n\ncountermeasures studied; they were: Well integrity failure, Single Well Tracer Test \n\nfailure, SP/P failure, and chemical quality-related risks. The second risk was \n\nmaterialized due to poor injectivity, resulting in a change of the program to a \n\nsurfactant plus brine injection after back producing the SP batch. Despite the \n\nchallenges and risks, it was categorized as a success as safety was maintained \n\nduring all the project, a significant oil desaturation was achieved, the tracer injection \n\nwas a success as it helps evaluate the uncertainties on porosity channels, residual \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\n \n \n\noil saturation, and reservoir dispersity. It was reporting a reduction of oil saturation \n\nof approximately 4 units of saturation within 1 meter around the well. \n\nIzadi et al. (2018) reported a technically successful SP injection on a pilot \n\nscale on the Illinois basin. The pilot had four injectors and nine producers, where oil \n\nproduction increased up to twenty times in offset producers. The development of the \n\npilot followed a laboratory study, a numerical simulation model and implementation \n\nof the pilot. The chemical blend was made up of an HPAM polymer at 2500 ppm and \n\na blend of three anionic surfactants at 0.7%w. This article was the following part of \n\nthe laboratory research explained in section 3.1. \n\nAs was observed in this state of the art, there are various opportunities \n\nrelating the SP flood on carbonate rock in offshore reservoirs. Among them, finding \n\nchemicals appropriate to those conditions is needed; evaluating their performance \n\nonly in the laboratory is not enough, a simulation phase composed of global \n\nsensitivity analysis and optimization taking into account the variables interacting \n\nsuch as concentrations, injection profiles and economic scenarios can bring answers \n\nmore realistic to, how feasible this type of program in no traditional scenarios which \n\nare the offshore fields and carbonate reservoir exploiting. \n\n3.3. NUMERICAL SIMULATION \n\nIn the literature, there are some simulation-based studies for SP flooding, \n\nevaluating the economic viability, the finding of optimal parameters and conditions \n\nfor its application, by using different optimization techniques and sensitivity analysis, \n\nsome of them are detailed next. There are other simulations works having as scope \n\nASP, AS, Surfactant and polymer optimization and evaluation, but studying them is \n\nnot within the objectives of this research, therefore are not described here. \n\nA sensitivity and optimization of a quarter spot model were performed for an \n\nSP, and ASP injections in mixed-wet dolomite, where the optimum design was \n\nselected based on the net present value (ANDERSON et al., 2006) and the input \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\n \n \n\ndata was obtained from previously performed tests. The reservoir had water cut \n\nabout 98%, average porosity of 16%, average permeability of 156 mD, a 31\u00b0API oil \n\nand brine with 60315 ppm of TDS. Sensitivity analysis was based on 21 simulation \n\nruns where it was analyzed the slug size, chemical concentrations, salinity, polymer \n\nmass, surfactant and polymer adsorption, heterogeneity, and the capillary \n\ndesaturation curve. All the previous runs were later analyzed using the concept of \n\ndiscounted cash flow analysis, where crude oil price and surfactant cost were varied \n\nas to obtain different NPV and subsequently selecting the two optimal. These were \n\nthe cases where low surfactant adsorption was selected, and a higher polymer \n\nconcentration as defined. \n\nLater, Mollaei et al. (2011) performed a global sensitivity analysis of the SP \n\nprocess, using an analytical chemical flood predictive model which calculates the \n\nultimate recovery efficiency as a product of volumetric sweep efficiency, \n\ndisplacement efficiency and the efficiency of the mobility buffer. A database of 1381 \n\nonshore fields was collected and used for this study and the results of each case on \n\nthe analytical model. Their research used a sensitivity analysis called Winding Stairs \n\nwhich requires a smaller number of runs than a Monte Carlo method and identifies \n\nthe individual and total effect of each parameter studied on the sensitivity, helping to \n\nidentify the interrelations between variables and their respective uncertainty. For this \n\nstudy, the settings studied were: surfactant concentration, surface density, pattern, \n\ninterfacial tension, rock density, adsorption, water viscosity, oil viscosity, net \n\nthickness, heterogeneity, residual oil saturation, and porosity. It can be highlighted \n\nof their research that the previously mentioned parameters (permeability, porosity, \n\nheterogeneity, and oil viscosity) brought the higher uncertainty either individually or \n\nby interacting with others on the performance of the SP flooding. Nor economic \n\nvariables were studied, and neither offshore fields were evaluated on the original \n\ndatabase. \n\nOne year later, Alsofi et al. (2012) performed a similar study also using \n\ncoreflooding test data for a carbonate sample, followed by sensitivity analysis and \n\nan optimization process was carried out as to evaluate the performance of and SP \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\n \n \n\nflooding on a 1D model resembling the coreflooding. The rock and test condition \n\nwere: 90\u00b0C, pore pressure of 21MPa, 0.2% of polymer and surfactant concentration, \n\nand brine with 84715 ppm of TDS. The methodology followed was: (1) laboratory \n\ndesign, (2) model construction based on laboratory data, (3) base runs, (4) tuning \n\nand history matching of the coreflooding, (4) sensitivity analysis and (5) numerical \n\noptimization. The sensitivity analysis evaluated different parameters on the \n\nUTCHEM software used for the simulation of the numerical models; while the \n\noptimization was performed by running ten scenarios where chemical concentration, \n\nslug sizes, and chemical consumption were performed. It was found that the \n\nsimulation run could not obtain the asymmetrical oil banking profile observed in the \n\nlaboratory test; the sensitivity test showed that the oil recovery of the SP injection \n\nvaried greatly as the IFT is modified and the optimization phase indicated that a high \n\npolymer to surfactant concentration ratio could bring more effective results. \n\nAlsofi. Liu and Han (2013) studied the SP flooding numerical simulation using \n\nlaboratory data experiments on a carbonate rock. The study was based on five \n\ncoreflooding tests where slug size, chemicals concentrations, and brine salinity were \n\nevaluated at reservoir conditions 21 MPa and 90\u00b0C. After it, a simulation model was \n\nconstructed, and history matched as to reflect the injection and later optimized by \n\nsimulating 10 cases varying the parameters mentioned and including a chemical \n\nconsumption. It was found: (1) despite a reasonable consistency between simulation \n\nand experiment was found, the model could not model the oil banking profile; (2) \n\nthere is a direct relationship between the IFT reduction and higher recovery volumes; \n\n(3) the slug size affected the final oil recovery however it varied only between 3-1%; \n\nand (4) optimal results were found on high Polymer to surfactant ratio \n\nconcentrations. \n\nAl-Dousari and Garrouch (2013) introduced an artificial neural network model \n\nfor SP flooding evaluation based on 18 dimensionless parameters defined on \n\nanother research and the associated results of 624 model runs. In their study is \n\nexplained how the proposed model was constructed looking for the optimal selection \n\nof hidden layer and neurons, and later a training phase with a set of 499 simulated \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\n \n \n\nresponds and 125 field cases to validate its results. Concluding that the model it\u2019s \n\nan alternative to evaluate the oil recovery of SP injections with less computational \n\ncost as the traditional simulators. \n\nBahrami et al. (2016) proposed Genetic programming as a methodology to \n\nestimate the  RF and the NPV in an SP flooding and later optimizing it based on \n\nselected parameters. The methodology followed the compilation of 202 data points \n\nof a sandstone reservoir and their corresponding economic evaluation. The \n\nparameters used as input variables for the Genetic Programming were slug sizes, \n\nchemical concentrations, salinity, and the ratio between vertical and horizontal \n\npermeabilty having as output the RF and the NPV. Their algorithm picked 161 data \n\nfor training and 41 for testing the program, and two models were developed one for \n\nthe RF and another for the NPV. It was presented for both models an accuracy of \n\n0.963 and 0.946 on their residual square, showing a high correspondence; with this \n\nresult and the advantage of not requiring a fundamental description of the physical \n\nproperties of the model makes it a possible method to evaluate the performance of \n\ninjection programs. Regarding the optimized input parameters, all had a positive \n\neffect and a direct relationship with the RF model. As for the NPV, the variables of \n\nslug size and surfactant concentration had both a positive and a negative effect \n\nassociated with higher recovered volumes but higher associated costs. These \n\nshowed themselves effective; however, an optimization base on economic \n\nuncertainties should be considered as they also have a high impact on the project \n\nresults. \n\nKamari et al. (2016) presented two models to evaluate the recovery factor and \n\nNPV of SP flooding for sandstone oil reservoir, obtained using the Least Square \n\nSupport Vector Machine methodology (LSSVM). This methodology can be described \n\nas a supervised learning method in which a set of data is analyzed based on several \n\ninput and output variables to recognize patterns and to solve classification problems \n\nwith a set of linear equations. For this research, a databank of SP flooding models \n\nusing UTCHEM simulator was used, this data bank included for each case seven \n\ninput variables and two outputs, RF and NPV. This set was later divided into three \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\n \n \n\nsub-dataset, training, validating and testing as to develop the models with the \n\nLSSVM. Their results concluded that the models for the NPV and RF brought \n\nacceptable results, and the total correlation coefficient for both of them was 0.993. \n\nAlso, after executing a sensitivity analysis, they found that the slug size and \n\nsurfactant concentration had the most significant impact on the RF model, while for \n\nthe NPV the surfactant and polymer concentration had the most significant effect on \n\nthe NPV model. \n\n  \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\n \n \n\n4. METHODOLOGY \n\nThe methodology followed in this research can be divided into five steps, as \n\nobserved in Figure 4-1: \n\nFigure 4-1 Research flowchart divided into steps \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019. \n\n1. Defining input information for waterflooding, Polymer flooding, and Surfactant-\n\nPolymer flooding from laboratory test and literature. For this research, polymer \n\nviscosity was evaluated on a laboratory level, while for the surfactant, parameters \n\nsuch as interfacial tension, adsorption, and CMC data was taken from the \n\nliterature. A screening of three available surfactants was carried out in the \n\nlaboratory, were adsorption and CMC were obtained. Having as main objective \n\nto evaluate what should be the expected behavior of different types of surfactant \n\nat this reservoir conditions and later selecting based on these results one \n\nchemical fulfilling the requirements of adsorption, CMC and IFT behavior. \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\n \n \n\n2.

Discussed and evaluate the results for all three injections on all the models, Lula \n\nbased, and Jupiter based as to define how plausible it\u2019s the SP flooding in the \n\nscenarios defined when compared with other techniques. \n\n4.1. LABORATORY PHASE \n\nAt first, it must be mentioned that microemulsion phase behavior tests or \n\ndirect characterization of the interfacial tension between the aqueous solution and \n\nthe crude oil is one of the inputs for the simulation and such tests were not carried \n\n\n\n30 \n \n\n \n \n\nout in this laboratory work. The microemulsion phase behavior requires many tests \n\nand several screenings to select the best surfactants for the reservoir conditions, \n\nrequiring, therefore, research focused on it. Moreover, the lack of dead crude oil on \n\nour facilities and equipment to measure ultra-low interfacial tensions (~1*10-3 mN/m) \n\nmade its evaluation unavailable. \n\nIn this way, the CMC determination and surfactant adsorption of available \n\nsurfactants in the saline medium and, also required for the simulation were used as \n\nreference parameters to search in the literature, experimental data from a chemical \n\nwith similar or better performance, including, the ultra-low interfacial values.  \n\nThis chapter describes the chemicals and solutions prepared to obtain the \n\nsurfactant adsorption, surfactant critical micelle concentration (CMC) and polymer \n\nviscosity. This latter is also a required parameter for the simulation phase.  \n\n4.1.1. Surfactant \n\nThree surfactants were characterized in the initial laboratory screening phase \n\nto study their behavior, in a high salinity medium, specifically regarding the CMC and \n\nadsorption behavior: anionic, cationic, and non-ionic samples.  \n\n? Anionic: Sodium C14 -16 Olefin Sulfonate, 315 g/mol, liquid at 39.1 % active. \n\n? Cationic: Hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), 364.45 g/mol, solid \n\npowder, 98% active.  \n\n? Non-ionic: Oleyl cetyl alcohol Ethylene oxide, Molecular weight not specified, \n\nsolid paste, 99 % active.  \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\n \n \n\n4.1.2. Polymer \n\nA Xanthan gum was selected because of its divalent cations tolerance and \n\ndegradation temperature over 80\u00b0C (higher than pre-salt value). It was used for the \n\nlaboratory phase a 200 mesh sample provided by Labsynth, and for the simulation \n\nphase, it was assumed a molecular weight of 2x106 Da (ROSALAM; ENGLAND, \n\n2006). \n\nThe rheological behavior of the polymer was obtained in the laboratory \n\nfollowing a power law model, as it is described in the next sections.  \n\n4.1.3. Brine \n\nA base high salinity synthetic brine resembling the one that could be produced \n\nin an offshore facility to be later treated and reinjected on the reservoir (Table \n\n4.1.3-1) is being used for the laboratory phase of this research. \n\nTable 4.1.3-1 Synthetic Brine composition.  \n\nSynthetic Brine \ncomposition \n\nNa+ (ppm) 29505 \n\nCl- (ppm) 63799 \n\nMg2+ (ppm) 4066 \n\nCa2+ (ppm) 6993 \n\nTDS (ppm) 104361 \n\n4.1.4. Critical Micelle Concentration Determination \n\nIn order to determine the CMC of surfactant, it is employed surface tension with \n\nthe methodology described by Mukerjee &amp; Mysels (1971). This procedure bases in \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\n \n \n\nmeasuring the surface tension of different surfactant concentrations in the same \n\nbrine and later plotting the results against the logarithm of the respective \n\nconcentration. A sharp decline is observed after which the curve will behave \n\nrelatively horizontal (almost constant surface tension) as can be observed in Figure \n\n4.1.4-1. This intersection where the curve changes of slope and starts a plateau is \n\nknown as the CMC. A Du No\u00fcy ring tensiometer \u2013 Kruss Company, model K6 was \n\nused on this research (Figure 4.1.4-2). \n\nFigure 4.1.4-1 Surfactant concentration and micelle formation. \n\n \n\nSource: SHENG, 2011 \n\nFigure 4.1.4-2 Du No\u00fcy ring Tensiometer. \n\n \n\nSource: KR\u00dcSS GMBH, 2018. \n\nSome key procedural points of the test were: \n\n? The test was performed with two different solutions; the first was a distilled water, \n\nand the second one a brine with a NaCl concentration of 70 g/l.  \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\n \n \n\n? Triplicate measurements were taken, so the average and standard deviation per \n\npoint could be registered in plotted graphs. \n\n? Each CMC point was obtained intersecting the line trends and solving their \n\ncorresponding equations for the two sections to get the most precise coordinate.  \n\n? Before each series of measurements, the device must be calibrated with \n\ndemineralized water, so the surface tension at 20\u00b0C was expected to be 72-73 \n\nmN/m. \n\n? The solution must be a sample from the middle of the bottle, so no excess was \n\nmeasured in the surface and only the bulk in the center. \n\n4.1.5. Surfactant Adsorption \n\nIn addition to the required chemical parameters previously mentioned, the \n\nsurfactant adsorption is also a parameter used in the simulation. The surfactant \n\nadsorption behavior should be reviewed as it depends on surfactant type, \n\nconcentration, rock minerals, temperature, pH, the flow rate of the solution, among \n\nothers (SHENG, 2011). It can be evaluated either in a dynamic or static test, \n\nhowever, for this research scope, only the latter one was performed \n\n(SHAMSIJAZEYI; HIRASAKI; VERDUZCO, 2013; PARK; LEE; SULAIMAN, 2015; \n\nLI et al., 2016).  \n\nFor the static adsorption, the surfactants are dissolved in the synthetic \n\nformation brine at different concentrations, later rock dolomitic carbonate powder \n\nsieved in a 100-200 mesh is mixed with the solution for 24 hours in a 1:50 mass ratio \n\nat room temperature. The mixture is filtered, and the supernatant is titrated to \n\ndetermine the residual surfactant concentration (a potentiometric titrator version 916 \n\nTi-Touch from Metrohm) and later constructing the adsorption curve for cationic and \n\nanionic surfactants. As for nonionic the surfactant, the methodology followed was \n\nbased on comparing the surface tension of a baseline solution of surfactant and \n\nbrine, against the surface tension of the supernatant fluid after being in contact with \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\n \n \n\nthe rock powder, a procedure detailed by Kaln (2009). The formula to find the \n\nadsorption on milligrams of surfactant adsorbed per grams of rock is the next one, \n\n?????????? =\n(?????)?\n\n?????\n  (12) \n\nWhere Co and Ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of the \n\nadsorbate, M is the mass of adsorbate solution in contact with the adsorbent and \n\ngrock is the weight of the adsorbent used \n\n4.1.6. Polymer evaluation \n\nTo evaluate the polymer, the American Petroleum Institute (API) \n\nRecommended Practice 63 \u201cRecommended Practices for evaluation of Polymers \n\nused in Enhanced Oil Recovery Operations\u201d was followed, in addition to other \n\nrelevant literature (AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE, 1990).  \n\nThe polymer viscosity requirement was based on crude oil viscosity. So, a \n\npolymeric solution slightly above the crude oil viscosity is searched (SHENG; \n\nLEONHARDT; AZRI, 2015; LEVITT et al., 2016). Four polymeric solutions in a brine \n\nsolution (Table 2) with concentrations of 500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 ppm were \n\nprepared. For each one, 4 measures of viscosity were obtained employing a model \n\n35 Fann viscometer (Figure 4.1.6-1). Next, it is briefly explained the procedure \n\nfollowed to obtain the viscosity measurement as a shear rate function (AMERICAN \n\nPETROLEUM INSTITUTE, 1990). \n\n1. Measure the viscosity of the solution at four rotor speeds: 100, 200, 300, 600 \n\nrpm. Starting at the lowest velocity and going upward. \n\n2. Calculate the viscosity of each point following a Power Law model. For this \n\nresearch purpose, it was employed the model described by Bourgoyne et al. \n\n(1986): \n\n \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\n \n \n\n? = ?? ??1  (13)  ? = 3.322 log (\n?600\n\n?300\n)  (14) \n\n \n\n? =\n0.0106?300\n\n511?\n  (15) \n\nWhere ?, K, n and ? are the apparent viscosity, in cP, consistency index in \n\nunits of pounds force per second per square feet; flow-behavior index and \n\nshear rate in s-1 respectively.  \n\n3. Plot the data obtained as viscosity versus shear rate, specifying the polymer \n\nconcentration. \n\nFigure 4.1.6-1 Fann model 35 viscometer for polymer evaluation. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019. \n\n4.2. SIMULATION PHASE \n\nIn this chapter, it is shown and highlighted the main stages to build two 3D \n\nnumeric models by BUILDER v.2017, later run on STARS v.2018 and GEM v.2016.2 \n\nsimulators (Thermal &amp; Advanced Process Reservoir Simulator; Compositional &amp; \n\nUnconventional Reservoir Simulator, both from CMG). The version of GEM \n\nemployed allowed the modeling of microemulsion behavior not available on their \n\nnext releases.  \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\n \n \n\nThe simulation phase was divided into several steps, as can be seen in \n\nFigure 4.2-1. First, the collection of laboratory and literature data from the previous \n\nphase and information required for the reservoir model construction, including fluid, \n\nrock, and chemistry characteristics. This step includes generating a model \n\nresembling the information of a Brazilian, offshore field specifically for the Santos \n\nBasin. Additionally, a second model is adapted, CERENA I model, which is a \n\nsynthetic reservoir model built by the CERENA Research group to resemble the \n\nJupiter field. From this full field model, a pilot size model was taken and adapted \n\nfrom Fabusuyi (2015) research. Finally, the construction of the economic model to \n\nevaluate the performance of all three injection programs: WF, PF, and SP; and \n\nselection of the output data to be analyzed in the simulations results for each inverted \n\nfive spot model (IFS).  \n\nSecond, the simulation of three cases was carried out for each IFS model: \n\nwater flooding, as the base case, polymer flooding, as EOR comparative case; and \n\nSP flood, as the study case. For each one of the cases, an optimization of \n\nparameters was carried out, under three economic scenarios, and three \n\nheterogeneous models were the average permeability in all three directions was \n\nmultiplied by a factor as to account for this uncertainty. The water cut and Net \n\nPresent Value were optimized using the Integrated Analysis &amp; Optimization Tool \u2013 \n\nCMOST, from CMG package. This phase analyses the results obtained for each \n\ncase, individually, and reviews the performance to observe the advantages and \n\ndisadvantages of the SP flood, on a typical water flooding and conventional chemical \n\nflooding as the Polymer injection. For this study case, it is analyzed the operation \n\nparameters and rock-fluid/fluid-fluid phenomena, inside the porous media.  \n\nThird, based on the results of both inverted five spot models, average \n\ncumulative production per well, recovery factor and optimal parameters, the water \n\ninjection and the SP flood processes are evaluated. With this approach, it is possible \n\nto verify how the SP program operates in a theoretical model and a more realistic \n\ncase.  \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\n \n \n\nThe Cerena Field and the inverted five-spot model were adapted from \n\nFabusuyi and Pinto's researches (MADEIRA, 2014; FABUSUYI, 2015) from Petrel \n\nand Eclipse to the BUILDER module from CMG, to be later simulated on the \n\nReservoir Simulator GEM. For this work, it was assumed that the PVT results, \n\npetrophysics, and structural properties of the reservoir are well defined, and no \n\nfurther change or evaluation is required. The PVT data used was the same employed \n\nby Pinto\u2019s research, meaning that it was not required matching of laboratory / \n\nliterature data. The inverted five spot model was used for this research to keep the \n\nbenchmark of the Cerena model. \n\nFigure 4.2-1 Flowchart of the simulation phase for both models. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019  \n\n5. CASE STUDY \n\nTwo models were studied in this research, one constructed by taking the \n\ninformation of the literature of the Lula field, and a second one, more complex, \n\nextracted from a previously full field-built model based on the Jupiter field. Both \n\nstudies were carried out to have a broader view of how the chemical methodologies \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\n \n \n\ncompare in different scenarios of the pre-salt basin. A second reason for the \n\nsimultaneous study in both models, was to avoid not conclusive results regarding \n\nany of the parameters, for example, as will be mentioned later in the results section, \n\none of the models presented injectivity problems, an issue which limited the analysis \n\nof some parameters selected. \n\nBoth models differ in properties such as API, porosity, wettability, Original Oil \n\nin Place and pressures, even when these fields are members of the same basin. \n\nAn inverted five spot configuration was selected for both models to keep the \n\nbenchmark of the Cerena model carried out by other researches (MADEIRA, 2014; \n\nFABUSUYI, 2015). \n\n5.1. INVERTED FIVE SPOT MODELS DESCRIPTION \n\n5.1.1. Cerena-I \n\nThe Cerena-I synthetic model is a replica of some of the common \n\ncharacteristics of a Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonate, specifically the Jupiter field. The \n\ninitial model is a corner-point grid with 161x161x300 cells, with 25x25x1m \n\ndimensions. It is composed of three blocks and two facies each, a microbiolite \n\nreservoir facie and a mudstone non-reservoir facie (MADEIRA, 2014). The porosity \n\nand permeability distributions and lateral view of the reservoir can be observed in \n\nFigure 5.1.1-1 and Figure 5.1.1-2 respectively, where can be seen the representation \n\nof the facies mentioned before with a large number of cells with low porosity and low \n\npermeability, and a smaller quantity of cells corresponding to the microbiolite facies \n\nwith larger porosities and permeabilities.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 5.1.1-1 Porosity distribution and lateral view of the porosity \n\ndistribution of Cerena-I. \n\n \n\nSource: MADEIRA, 2014  \n\nFigure 5.1.1-2 Permeability I distribution and lateral view of permeability I of \n\nCerena-I. \n\n \n\nSource: MADEIRA, 2014 \n\nFor the evaluation of each injection program, it was selected the sector model \n\nextracted by Fabusuyi (2015) on his research of the middle block of the Cerena \n\nmodel, with its corresponding characteristics worked by him. It was decided on this \n\nresearch to maintain the same pattern of the wells to keep the benchmark of the \n\nmodel for future works. \n\n\n\n40 \n \n\n \n \n\nThe wells positioning in the reservoir model corresponds to an inverted five-\n\nspot, this configuration has four vertical producers, and one injector in the center \n\nobserved in Figure 5.1.1-3. The model does not present aquifer neither gas cap, \n\nformed by a 22x22x154 cells grid and 50 m x 50 m x 2 m dimensions, with porosity \n\nand permeability following the distribution found in Figure 5.1.1-4.  \n\nFigure 5.1.1-3 Inverted Five spot model used in this work - Permeability in I \n\ndirection. \n\n  \n\nSource: MADEIRA, 2014  \n\nFigure 5.1.1-4 Histogram distribution of the inverted five-spot model Cerena-I for \n\n(a) porosity and (b) permeability I direction.  \n\n \n\nSource: MADEIRA, 2014 \n\n\n\n41 \n \n\n \n \n\n5.1.2. Lula based model \n\nA 3D geological reservoir model was built in the BUILDER module, to be later \n\nsimulated on the Reservoir Simulator STARS. For the builder input data, it is \n\nassumed, an entire heterogeneous reservoir saturated with oil and water, over its \n\nbubble point so that no gas phase could be encountered at the initiation of the model. \n\nThe wells positioning in the reservoir model corresponds to an inverted five-\n\nspot, this configuration has four vertical producers and one injector in the center, \n\nwithout aquifer and gas cap, formed by a 20x20x7 cells grid and 200 ft x 200 ft x 29 \n\nft (Figure 5.1.2-1), with porosity and permeability following a normal and lognormal \n\ndistribution respectively. Moreover, the properties were fixed, so it resembles a \n\ncarbonate offshore reservoir with medium oil. \n\nFigure 5.1.2-1 Inverted five spot model based on Lula Field Properties, \n\nporosity. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\n5.2. ROCK AND FLUID PROPERTIES  \n\n \n\nIn this section, it is presented the rock and fluid properties employed as input \n\nfor both models, Cerena-I and the Lula based model. \n\n\n\n42 \n \n\n \n \n\n5.2.1. Cerena-I  \n\nThe Cerena I field properties resemble the Jupiter field in Brazil; therefore the \n\nIFS model extracted has the same properties as for their initialization.

ECONOMIC MODELS \n\nAll EOR methods: water, polymer and SP flooding were optimized under the \n\nwater cut and NPV for both IFS models. The economic scenarios were built following \n\na simplified Brazilian regime, having as main taxes and contribution variables \n\npresented in Table 5.4-1.  \n\n0.5\n\n0.7\n\n0.9\n\n1.1\n\n3000 4500 6000 7500 9000O\nil\n\n v\nis\n\nco\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\ncP\n)\n\nPressure (psia)\n\n\n\n50 \n \n\n \n \n\nTable 5.4-1 Simplified Brazilian regime.  \n\nVariable Value \n\nCorporate tax 25% \n\nRoyalty 10% \n\nSocial contribution 9% \n\nSocial taxes rates (PIS, Cofins) 9.25% \n\nSource: SAMPAIO et al., 2013 \n\nFor all cases, the net present value was discounted by an investment covering \n\nthe drilling and completion of wells, production platform, and abandonment. The \n\neconomic parameters are resumed in Table 5.4-2 and were based on the individual \n\nworks of several researchers (ALSOFI et al., 2013; SAMPAIO et al., 2013; SHENG, \n\n2014; GASPAR et al., 2015; SCHIOZER, 2015). As fior the project time a maximum \n\nof 30 years was selected for both, Lula and Cerena, however, if the shut-in \n\nconstraints were reached before this limit the project was finished earlier. \n\nTable 5.4-2 General economic parameters used economic evaluation.  \n\nParameter IFS Cerena IFS Lula \n\nNumber of Wells 5 5 \n\nInvestment on Platform (MMUSD) 985 305.96 \n\nDrilling and completion of vertical wells (MMUSD) 175 21.67 \n\nInvestment in the exploration (MMUSD) 30 2.8 \n\nAbandonment cost  8.2% of drilling cost \n\nAnnual discount rate  9 % \n\nChemical facility Cost (MMUSD) 49.25 15.3 \n\nSource:  ALSOFI et al., 2013; SAMPAIO et al., 2013; SHENG, 2014; \n\nGASPAR et al., 2015; SCHIOZER, 2015 \n\nFor the Lula based IFS, despite there are four producer\u2019s wells, it is important \n\nto highlight that each one of them is occupying only one-fourth of the well capacity. \n\nTherefore, the costs only represent the total expenditure for two wells, one injector, \n\nand one producer, the latter divided into four sections (exploration and platform \n\ninvestment). The platform cost depends of the fluid rates expected in the project; \n\ntherefore, it was higher for the Cerena than for the Lula. \n\nMoreover, being more specific, for the calculation of the investments \n\nabandonment and fluids related cost, it was employed the values state by Schiozer \n\n\n\n51 \n \n\n \n \n\net al. (2015). While the chemical facility cost was assumed as five percent (5%) of \n\nthe platform investment base on AlSofi et al. (2013) research which employed a \n\nsimilar relation between both expenditures in a polymer flooding optimization. The \n\nfacilities and treatment for the salinity content of the water injected was no taken into \n\naccount in this research however it can increase the associated costs of the \n\ntechnology. \n\nTo assess the performance of the SP flooding, if compared with a polymer \n\nflooding and water injection, both optimized, an Expected Monetary Value (EMV) \n\nmethodology alongside a derivation three analysis was used. For both inverted five \n\nspot models, it was considered three levels of reservoir heterogeneity and economic \n\nscenarios. These evaluation schemes can be observed in Figure 5.4-1. For the \n\nevaluation, each branch from the tree was assigned with a percentage weight for the \n\nfinal EMV calculation. \n\nFigure 5.4-1 Derivation tree analysis for the inverted five-spot models. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019  \n\nFor the EMV, it was applied a simple multiplication between the weight \n\npercentage of the branch, the model probability (30% and 40%) and the \n\n\n\n52 \n \n\n \n \n\ncorresponding NPV. Finally, the results for each branch were summed up to \n\ncalculate the EMV for each EOR methodology for each model, either WF, PF or SP. \n\nThe economic parameters considered for each optimization are presented in \n\nTable 5.4-3. Aiming at a balanced comparison between the water, polymer and SP \n\ninjection programs, it was carried out optimization for all cases employing CMOST \n\nmodule from CMG, specifically the PSO having as objective function the NPV.  \n\nTable 5.4-3 Economic scenarios and parameters.  \n\nScenarios \nOil Price \n(US$/bbl) \n\nOil \nProduction \n\nCost \n(US$/bbl) \n\nWater \nProduction \n\nCost \n(US$/bbl) \n\nWater \nInjection \n\nCost \n(US$/bbl) \n\nPolymer \ncost \n\n(US$/Kg) \n\nSurfactant \ncost \n\n(US$/Kg) \n\nOptimistic 70 10 1.1 1.1 1.05 2.3 \n\nProbable 50 9 1 1 1 2.2 \n\nPessimistic 40 10 1.2 1.2 1.1 2.4 \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nFinally, the EMV for each injection program is compared, and the highest \n\nvalue is the one which brings the highest added value to the reservoir production \n\nprogram. \n\n5.5.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS \n\nIn this section the results of the laboratory, and simulation for both Cerena and Lula \n\nmodels are discussed. \n\n\n\n56 \n \n\n \n \n\n6.1. SURFACTANT INPUT SELECTION \n\nThe available surfactants (anionic, cationic and non-ionic) were characterized \n\nregarding their CMC adsorption in the saline medium.  \n\nFigure 6.1-1, presents the surface tension measurements for the anionic \n\nsurfactant in the saline medium.  It can be viewed the decreasing of the surface \n\ntension as the surfactant concentration increases and the intersection of these \n\nstraight lines for the high salinity brine at 48 mg/L, which is the CMC value. The \n\nreference in distilled water of the CMC given by the manufacturer was 301 mg/L. \n\nIn Figure 6.1-2, it is found the curves to find the CMC of the non-ionic \n\nsurfactant. There was no reference for this surfactant by the manufacturer in distilled \n\nwater. The CMC was found at brine conditions as 109 mg/L. \n\nLast, for the cationic surfactant, it was found a CMC of 300 mg/L in high brine \n\nconditions compared to 335 mg/L in distilled water given by the manufacturer. The \n\nlab plot obtained can be observed in Figure 6.1-3. \n\nThe difference of CMC between brine and distilled water conditions is known \n\nas \u201csalting out\u201d and it refers of how the salts present on the water steals the water \n\navailable for polar chain hydration from the micelles resulting on lower surfactant \n\nconcentrations required for the micelle concentration (HUBBARD, 2002; ROSEN, \n\n2004). \n\nAlthough at the CMC a solution attends its largest surface tension reduction, \n\na chemical EOR method requires higher volumes to compensate for possible \n\nconsumptions and losses on the reservoir due to entrapment or adsorption. \n\nTherefore, any field or simulation carried out must be over CMC concentration, and \n\nit is preferred a low CMC value, so the additional concentration does not affect the \n\neconomy of any project. Similar behavior is expected in their adsorption, so no \n\nadditional concentrations are added in the reservoir to compensate. \n\n\n\n57 \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.1-1 Anionic surfactant Surface Tension and Critical Micelle \n\nConcentration on NaCl high salinity brine, TDS 104361 ppm. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nFigure 6.1-2 Non-ionic surfactant Surface Tension and Critical Micelle \n\nConcentration on NaCl high salinity brine, TDS 104361 ppm. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nFigure 6.1-3 Cationic surfactant Surface Tension and Critical Micelle \n\nConcentration on NaCl high salinity brine, TDS 104361 ppm. \n\ny = -0.5179x + 55.337\ny = 0.0006x + 30.424\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n1 10 100 1000\n\nS\nu\n\nrf\na\nc\ne\n T\n\ne\nn\n\ns\nio\n\nn\n \n\n(m\nN\n\n/m\n)\n\nSurfactant Concentration (mg/L)\n\ny = -0.00005x + 36.03887\n\ny = -0.3556x + 74.681\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n1 10 100 1000 10000\n\nS\nu\n\nrf\na\n\nc\ne\n\n T\ne\n\nn\ns\n\nio\nn\n\n \n(m\n\nN\n/m\n\n)\n\nSurfactant Concentration (mg/L)\n\n\n\n58 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019. \n\nTable 6.1-1 CMC for each surfactant evaluated in the laboratory.  \n\nSurfactant \nCMC \nmg/L  \n\nSurface \nTension mN/m \n\nAnionic 48 30 \n\nNon-Ionic 36 109 \n\nCationic 25 300 \n\nSource: Author, 2019. \n\nRegarding surfactant adsorption, the cationic and anionic surfactant were \n\ntested as mentioned on the methodology by potentiometric titration and the non-ionic \n\nby comparing its surface tension behavior before and after rock powder presence. \n\nOn Figure 6.1-4 and Figure 6.1-5 it can be found the adsorption curves for the non-\n\nionic and anionic surfactants, were the plateau of adsorption was 6.3 mg/g-rock and \n\n73.3 mg/g-rock respectively. As for the cationic surfactant its adsorption was so low \n\nthat the delta between the surfactant before and after the presence of the rock after \n\n24 hours was not perceived with the potentiometric titrator, therefore its adsorption \n\nwas lower than 0.5 mg/g-rock, for this research due to the uncertainty of this measure \n\nit was selected this value reference of its adsorption.  In this way, the largest \n\nconsumption was on the anionic, followed by the nonionic and the cationic, behavior \n\nexpected as it was mentioned in section 2.1, the surface and surfactant charges play \n\na central role on the adsorption. In this case, the anionic with the negative charge \n\nwas attracted much more by the positive surface of the carbonate generating larger \n\nadsorption. The opposite happened to the cationic surfactant. \n\ny = -0.0502x + 40.287\n\ny = -0.0025x + 26.001\n\n20\n\n22\n\n24\n\n26\n\n28\n\n30\n\n32\n\n10 100 1000 10000\n\nS\nu\n\nrf\na\n\nc\ne\n\n T\ne\n\nn\ns\n\nio\nn\n\n \n(m\n\nN\n/m\n\n)\n\nSurfactant Concentration (mg/L)\n\n\n\n59 \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.1-4 Adsorption curve for the nonionic surfactant. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nFigure 6.1-5 Adsorption curve for the anionic surfactant. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nFrom these results, it was clear that it was required a surfactant with low \n\nadsorption similar to the cationic and non-ionic tested on the laboratory, and low \n\nCMC as the behavior encountered with the anionic surfactant, Table 6.1-1. The three \n\nsurfactants did not fulfill the requirement of low adsorption and low CMC at the same \n\ntime, therefore searching another surfactant was required. Additionally, as \n\nmentioned in the methodology, it was required information of the interfacial tension \n\nas a salinity function for a condition like the one encountered in the pre-salt \n\nreservoirs. \n\nTherefore, for the surfactant, after reviewing the literature the modeling data \n\nwere based on Zhang et al. (2013), using a sulfobetaine based zwitterionic surfactant \n\nwith high salinity tolerance, expecting low interfacial tension (IFT) at salinity \n\nconcentrations around 6% of salt content.

Therefore, polymer solutions with concentrations under \n\n1000 ppm did not fit the requirement, so were not used preliminary (0, 500 ppm). \n\nThe 1000 ppm line even when at some points w close to the oil viscosity and at very \n\nlow revolutions is higher, it is discarded because these velocities are not \n\nrepresentative of wellbore conditions, and aggressive conditions will bring \n\nuncertainties of the possible behavior of the polymer (mechanical degradation). So, \n\nthe other two options are 2000 ppm and 3000 ppm, however, even when both go \n\nover the condition established, the former concentration in a preliminary screening \n\nis the option selected. The main reason is, that higher polymer concentrations \n\nrepresent higher costs for an EOR method, moreover, a solution with a viscosity \n\nhigher than the expected can represent higher injection pressures at wellbore \n\nconditions. \n\nIt must be stated the viscosity behavior of the polymer was an input for the \n\nsimulation phase, so a more precise polymer concentration is obtained under the \n\noptimization step.

LULA INVERTED FIVE-SPOT MODEL SIMULATION RESULTS \n\nThe main results for the inverted five-spot model, based on the Lula field case \n\nstudy, are detailed in the next sections. \n\n6.3.1. Comparison between IOR methods \u2013 Economic Scenarios \n\nIn Table 6.3.1-1 shows the results obtained for the optimization of WF, PF, \n\nand SP. It can be noticed that despite the polymer injection reduced the volume of \n\ninjected and produced water, and kept the oil produced, the higher cost associated \n\nto the polymer injection reduced the NPV of the field exploitation program. As for the \n\nSP, the simultaneous injection of polymer and surfactant did increase the oil \n\nproduced and the recovery factor, while at the same time the water production and \n\nwater injection volumes were higher than the WF values, resulting in higher \n\nexpenditures on treatment and chemical injection. Such behavior summed up to a \n\nlonger production time of the model, it is reflected on a lower NPV when compared \n\nwith the water injection. This behavior was observed in all three models and \n\neconomic scenarios. \n\nTable 6.3.1-1 Results for Lula IFS.  \n\nM\no\n\nd\ne\nl \n\nScenario IOR \n\nOil \n\nProduction \n\n(MMBbl) \n\nWater \n\nproduction \n\n(MMBbl) \n\nWater \n\ninjection \n\n(MMBbl) \n\nPeriod \n\n(Years) \n\nPolymer \n\nCost \n\n(MMUSD) \n\nSurfactant \n\nCost \n\n(MMUSD) \n\nNPV \n\n(MMUSD) \n\nRF \n\n(%) \n\nFinal \n\nWCut \n\n(%) \n\nB\nA\n\nS\nE\n\n \n\n70 USD WF 28 47 89 20 - - 232.0 68% 96% \n\n70 USD PF 29 45 87 20 4.7 - 222.8 69% 96% \n\n70 USD SP 31 53 99 23 6.8 10.6 222.4 74% 95% \n\n50 USD WF 28 36 77 18 - - 52.1 67% 94% \n\n50 USD PF 28 34 75 17 4.4 - 41.1 67% 94% \n\n50 USD SP 30 45 90 21 4.6 10.1 41.5 73% 94% \n\n40 USD WF 26 17 56 13 - - -59.6 63% 91% \n\n40 USD PF 26 16 55 13 4.9 - -71.9 64% 90% \n\n40 USD SP 29 37 80 18 5.1 11.1 -83.5 71% 90% \n\n\n\n63 \n \n\n \n \n\nL\nO\n\nW\n \n\n70 USD WF 26 45 83 19 - - 192.7 62% 95% \n\n70 USD PF 26 42 80 19 6.7 - 183.4 63% 95% \n\n70 USD SP 28 59 101 23 10.0 21.8 177.9 68% 95% \n\n50 USD WF 25 35 72 17 - - 24.5 61% 94% \n\n50 USD PF 26 35 73 17 4.5 - 13.3 62% 94% \n\n50 USD SP 28 54 96 22 12.7 19.2 5.0 68% 94% \n\n40 USD WF 24 20 55 13 - - -81.1 58% 90% \n\n40 USD PF 24 21 57 13 5.0 - -93.8 59% 91% \n\n40 USD SP 26 35 74 17 11.8 17.8 -109.8 63% 88% \n\nH\nIG\n\nH\n \n\n70 USD WF 30 31 75 17 - - 255.7 72% 95% \n\n70 USD PF 30 31 76 17 4.8 - 246.4 72% 96% \n\n70 USD SP 34 57 107 24 9.0 10.6 236.0 82% 94% \n\n50 USD WF 29 28 71 16 - - 73.0 71% 94% \n\n50 USD PF 30 25 69 16 4.7 - 61.5 71% 93% \n\n50 USD SP 33 56 105 24 4.5 10.0 41.5 79% 90% \n\n40 USD WF 29 23 66 15 - - -43.5 70% 90% \n\n40 USD PF 29 22 66 15 4.9 - -56.6 71% 90% \n\n40 USD SP 32 48 95 22 6.4 11.2 -78.7 77% 88% \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nMoreover, it can be concluded that higher oil prices tend to favor the use of \n\nchemicals when observing that the exploitation period of the Probable and \n\nPessimistic scenario were shorter than the Optimistic Scenario with higher oil prices. \n\nIn years for the SP, 23>21>18 years and for the PF, 20>21>18 years, optimistic, \n\nprobable, and pessimistic respectively.  \n\nFor all three economic scenarios, both chemical programs proved to be not \n\nprofitable even after the optimization performed. Although both presented a positive \n\nend revenue on the optimistic and probable scenarios, the chemical cost impacted \n\nthe production program severally in the long run (15.3 MMUSD of chemical facilities \n\ncost at year one). However, it was proved that the PF brings lower volumes of \n\nproduced water and requires lower volumes of water injected. As for the SP program, \n\nit increases the oil recovery factor by allowing longer production periods, but the cost \n\nof having longer production periods and chemical cost kept the NPV on all three \n\nscenarios at the same value of the PF, and lower than the WF. \n\n\n\n64 \n \n\n \n \n\nOn the other hand, it can be stated that the SP was technically speaking a \n\nsuccess as it brought an incremental recovery ranging 5.5% to 10.3% when \n\ncomparing against the WF. Proving that not all technical projects are economically \n\nviable, as in this case, the incremental was not enough to cover the chemical \n\nexpenditure of injecting simultaneously surfactant, polymer and the facilities \n\ninvestment required for this procedure. Also, in all the six cases the final water cut \n\nwas the same or lower than the ones found on the WF and PF, with longer production \n\ntimes, stating that the mix of surfactant and polymer at least brings the same benefits \n\nas the polymer flooding by itself. \n\n6.3.2. Comparison of EOR methods - Geological models  \n\nFor this analysis, the optimized injection programs with an oil price of \n\n50USD/bbl were the cases taken to evaluate how the three models differ from each \n\nother for both the polymer flooding and the surfactant-polymer flooding. \n\nIn the literature can be found that a higher permeability is often desired on \n\nalmost all screening criteria as described by Sheng et al. (2015) because low \n\npermeability zones often present smaller transmissibility areas where the large \n\npolymer molecules may fail to flow.  \n\nIn Figure 6.3.2-1 are represented the water cut curves for all the three models \n\nfor the PF and SP injection. The uniform injection front on the reservoir results on \n\nmore instantaneous water cut increment of all production wells, which is reflected on \n\nclose to vertical slopes. As for the SP, the behavior is very similar; however, the \n\nwater cut reaches its maximum much slower than for PF, allowing for longer \n\nproduction times and therefore higher recoveries. This can be also observed in \n\nFigure 6.3.2-2 where the SP last for a longer period reaching higher recoveries than \n\nthe other two methodologies. \n\nFigure 6.3.2-1 Water cut curves for three heterogeneity models for both \n\nchemicals flooding at the probable economic scenario. \n\n\n\n65 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nIn Figure 6.3.2-2, it can be observed that with higher values of permeability, \n\neven when it is not a norm, higher recovery factor, therefore, larger produced \n\nvolumes. On the other hand, the model with less recovery was the one with 200mD. \n\nWF and PF shut-in at earlier times in all three models which ratified the improvement \n\nin the oil sweep and incremental oil of the SP technique. \n\nFigure 6.3.2-2 Oil recovery factor for all three heterogeneity models for all injection \n\nprograms at the probable economic scenario. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nIn Table 6.3.2-1, it can be noticed that the final results of the optimization did \n\nnot lead to an apparent relation about heterogeneity and polymer consumption, nor \n\n\n\n66 \n \n\n \n \n\nbecause it is inexistent but because the optimization followed the tendency to reduce \n\nto a minimum the chemical concentration and pore volumes injected.  \n\nTable 6.3.2-1 Polymer consumption and associated cost for each heterogeneity \n\nmodel. \n\nModel Scenario PV \nPol Conc \n\n(ppm) \n\nPol Cost \n\n(MMUSD) \n\nPol Qty \n\n(MMlbm) \n\nBASE \n\n50 USD 0.15 500 4.43 2.01 \n\n40 USD 0.15 500 4.87 2.01 \n\n70 USD 0.15 500 4.65 2.01 \n\nHIGH \n\n50 USD 0.15 525 4.66 2.11 \n\n40 USD 0.15 500 4.87 2.01 \n\n70 USD 0.15 500 4.80 2.07 \n\nLOW \n\n50 USD 0.15 500 4.52 2.05 \n\n40 USD 0.15 500 4.96 2.05 \n\n70 USD 0.21 500 6.67 2.88 \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nAs for the SP, on Table 6.3.2-2 can be observed that like PF, the optimization \n\ntended to the minimum injection of surfactant, as it is the highest cost material. But \n\nin this case, the tendency to have higher cost can be observed in the low permeability \n\ncase, which requires larger PV injected to bring similar recoveries as to the other two \n\nmodels in any of their scenarios. Concluding that low permeability reservoirs \n\nrequired larger quantities of chemical injection and may be not the best option for a \n\nCEOR injection. \n\nTable 6.3.2-2 Chemical consumption and associated cost for each heterogeneity \nmodel on SP flooding.  \n\nModel Scenario PV \nPol \n\n(ppm) \nSurf \n\nConc (%) \nPol Cost \n(MMUSD) \n\nSurf Cost \n(MMUSD) \n\nPol Qty \n(MMlbm) \n\nSurf Qty \n(MMlbm) \n\nBASE \n\n50 USD 0.15 500 0.05 4.60 10.12 2.09 2.09 \n\n40 USD 0.15 500 0.05 5.11 11.14 2.11 2.11 \n\n70 USD 0.15 701 0.05 6.80 10.62 2.94 2.10 \n\nHIGH \n\n50 USD 0.15 500 0.05 4.53 9.96 2.06 2.06 \n\n40 USD 0.15 630 0.05 6.44 11.16 2.66 2.11 \n\n70 USD 0.15 894 0.05 8.99 10.55 3.88 2.08 \n\n\n\n67 \n \n\n \n \n\nLOW \n\n50 USD 0.29 724 0.05 12.66 19.23 5.75 3.97 \n\n40 USD 0.24 726 0.05 11.83 17.77 4.88 3.36 \n\n70 USD 0.31 500 0.05 9.96 21.82 4.31 4.31 \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\n6.3.3. Parameters optimization \n\nAll the field development programs: water, polymer, and surfactant-polymer \n\nfloodings were optimized for all economic and geological scenarios. This way, a \n\nbalanced comparison could be performed between the EOR methodologies. Next, \n\nthe key behaviors regarding the parameters being optimized for the PF and SP are \n\ndiscussed.  \n\n6.3.3.1. Polymer flooding parameters \n\nIn Table 6.3.3.1-1, it can be found the optimized parameters for all geological \n\nmodels and all the three economic scenarios.  It can be observed that despite the \n\ndifference of permeability, all three models in all three economic scenarios had the \n\nsmallest polymer concentration possible for this research. The main reason is the \n\nhigh cost associated to the chemical injection, which the optimizer reduces to \n\nimprove the NPV. In other words, there was an inverse correlation between chemical \n\nconcentration and NPV. This analogy can be observed in Figure 6.3.3.1-1, as the \n\npolymer concentration was reduced the NPV increases even going from losses to \n\nbring some profit until a plateau is reached and no further reduction alters the NPV. \n\nThe situation was accrued due to the economic parameters fixed for the pessimistic \n\nscenario. Thus, the optimization model brought as optimal, the cases where a \n\nminimum of the polymer was injected, with all NPVs were negative. \n\n\n\n68 \n \n\n \n \n\nAs for the optimistic model, it can be highlighted that the NPV delta in the \n\noptimistic model was much less than in the other two economic scenarios, showing \n\nthat higher oil prices increase the viability of using chemical EOR programs. \n\nTable 6.3.3.1-1 Optimized parameters for PF per model and economic scenario.  \n\nScenario 50 40 70 50 40 70 50 40 70 \n\nParameter/Model BASE BASE BASE HIGH HIGH HIGH LOW LOW LOW \n\nWCUT1 99.0% 96.0% 94.9% 99.0% 90.0% 95.8% 93.4% 90.0% 95.2% \n\nWCUT2 99.0% 98.2% 99.0% 99.0% 98.5% 99.0% 95.7% 90.3% 95.0% \n\nWCUT3 95.2% 90.0% 97.4% 99.0% 91.3% 98.5% 94.9% 96.1% 97.5% \n\nWCUT4 95.0% 91.5% 98.7% 94.9% 98.8% 97.8% 96.2% 97.0% 96.1% \n\nInjection Trigger \n(psi) \n\n7000 7000 7000 7000 7000 7000 7000 6879 6932 \n\nPV Injected 0.15 0.15 0.15 0.15 0.15 0.15 0.15 0.15 0.21 \n\nppm Pol 500 500 500 525.7 500 500 500 500 500 \n\nNPV (MMUSD) 41.1 -71.9 222.8 61.5 -56.6 246.4 13.3 -93.8 183.4 \n\n% Delta NPV -21.1% -20.6% -4.0% -15.8% -29.9% -3.7% -45.7% -15.7% -4.9% \n\nOil RF 67.3% 63.8% 68.7% 71.4% 70.6% 72.2% 61.8% 59.0% 62.9% \n\nIncremental RF 0.7% 0.8% 0.7% 0.3% 0.5% 0.8% 0.9% 1.1% 0.5% \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nBased on Table 6.3.3.1-1, it can be noticed that with higher average \n\npermeability, the higher NPV and RF are.

Therefore as the oil price increases, the water treatment is \n\ncompensated, allowing longer periods of production and higher cost due to large \n\nwater-oil ratios of fluid production. However, each well behaved differently for every \n\ngeological model, so fixing one or all well to the same water cut shut in will not bring \n\n\n\n69 \n \n\n \n \n\nprofits without an adequate selection. It can be seen in Figure 6.3.3.1-3 and Figure \n\n6.3.3.1-4 examples of this behavior. \n\nFigure 6.3.3.1-1 NPV versus polymer concentration injected on the polymer \n\nflooding for all three geological and a probable economic scenario. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nOn the contrary, the minimum average pressure on the reservoir at which the \n\ninjection well should be opened follows an opposite tendency, so a lower pressure \n\nmeans more time producing under no injection with the own reservoir energy. In \n\nFigure 6.3.3.1-2, it can be observed that the optimum moment to start the injection \n\nis in a range close to 6000 to 7000 psi.

Surfactant-polymer flooding parameters \n\nIn Table 6.3.3.2-1 can be found the optimized parameters for the surfactant-\n\npolymer flooding for all three modes and economic scenarios.  \n\nRegarding the production wells, it can be seen in Figure 6.3.3.2-1 and  Table \n\n6.3.3.2-1 that each well behaves differently in each model, as was discussed \n\npreviously for the Polymer flooding cases. Arriving at the same conclusion that fixing \n\none or all wells to the same shut-in water cut will not bring profits without an adequate \n\nselection.  \n\nFigure 6.3.3.2-1 Water cut shut-in behavior per economic scenario and every \n\nproducer. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nHowever, in Figure 6.3.3.2-1 can be evaluated that as the oil price increases \n\nthe water cut to shut in any of the wells increases, from 93% on the low model and \n\n96% on the high model. Now, talking individually from each producer, the only two \n\nwells with this tendency are number 2 and 4, as their distribution moves according \n\nto the price and the median of it. This behavior reflects how at higher oil prices wells, \n\n\n\n73 \n \n\n \n \n\nthey have larger final ultimate recoveries because water processing costs can be \n\ncompensated by the oil sells, confirmed with the values on Table 6.3.3.2-1 where \n\nthe shut-in water cuts are lower for the pessimistic scenario and larger for the \n\noptimistic scenario, on average only for the optimized results 96.9%>94.7%>92.2% \n\nfor the optimistic, probable and optimistic scenario. \n\nTable 6.3.3.2-1 Optimized parameters for Surfactant-polymer flooding per model \nand economic scenario.  \n\nScenario 50 40 70 50 40 70 50 40 70 \n\nModel BASE BASE BASE HIGH HIGH HIGH LOW LOW LOW \n\nWCUT1 99.0% 90.0% 94.0% 90.0% 90.7% 95.8% 94.8% 90.0% 95.2% \n\nWCUT2 95.3% 90.0% 98.3% 90.0% 90.0% 99.0% 98.5% 93.1% 95.0% \n\nWCUT3 94.3% 96.0% 98.6% 90.0% 90.4% 98.5% 94.2% 99.0% 97.5% \n\nWCUT4 97.1% 96.9% 97.4% 94.6% 90.0% 97.8% 98.0% 90.0% 96.1% \n\nInjection trigger \n(psi) \n\n5500 6681 5501 6957 6864 7000 6499 5500 6932 \n\nPV Injected 0.15 0.15 0.15 0.15 0.15 0.15 0.29 0.24 0.21 \n\nPol (ppm) 500 500 701 500 630 500 724 726 500 \n\nSalt in chemical \nbatch (ppm) \n\n43833 57805 48990 20000 59104 49259 44795 41969 40835 \n\nSalt pos \nchemical batch \n\n(ppm) \n20000 100000 100000 100000 100000 20000 20000 20000 20000 \n\nSurfactant (%) 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 \n\n  NPV (MMUSD) 41.5 -83.5 222.4 41.5 -78.7 246.4 5 -109.8 183.4 \n\n% Delta NPV -20.3% -40.1% -4.1% -43.2% -80.8% -3.7% -79.4% -35.4% -4.9% \n\nOil RF 73.4% 70.5% 73.8% 79.2% 77.2% 72.2% 68.3% 63.4% 62.9% \n\nIncremental RF 6.8% 7.6% 5.8% 8.1% 7.0% 0.8% 7.4% 5.5% 0.5% \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nAnother tendency that can be observed is that the low permeability model in \n\nall cases had the larger pore volumes injected, indicating higher volumes of the \n\nchemical slug are required to achieve higher oil recoveries as the permeability is \n\nlowered. \n\nAs for polymer concentration, it was observed a similar behavior as the found \n\nfor the polymer flooding, the optimal value went to the lower range, because of the \n\nhigh cost associated to the polymer powder, therefore, a small amount of the \n\n\n\n74 \n \n\n \n \n\nchemical gives better NPV as it is reduced. This analogy can be observed in Figure \n\n6.3.3.2-2, as the polymer concentration is reduced the NPV increases even going \n\nfrom losses to bring some profit until a plateau is reached and no further reduction \n\nalters the NPV in a  range of 800 to 500 ppm. This range matched with the one in \n\nthe Table 6.3.3.2-1 that had values slightly over 700ppm. This points to the idea that \n\nthe parameters controlling the NPV of the project where the polymer concentration \n\nand the size of chemical batch injected. \n\nFigure 6.3.3.2-2 NPV versus polymer concentration injected on the Surfactant-\n\npolymer flooding for all three geological and a probable economic scenario. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nBased on Table 6.3.3.2-1, it can be noticed that higher average permeability \n\nand oil prices result in higher recovery factors. However, it also proves that higher \n\nrecoveries not always do bring larger NPVs, as for this the reduction was 34.6% on \n\naverage when comparing against the waterflooding. Also, the water cut to shut the \n\nwells tends to be over 94% in 9 of 12 times. However, the average water cut to shut \n\nin producers in the High model, is of 91.1%, less than the average of the other two \n\nmodels, 96.4%. Closing earlier the wells can be the cause of why it is presenting \n\nsimilar NPV that the Base case, something irregular when comparing the \n\noptimization results of the other economic scenarios and injection programs where \n\nthe High permeability model is always the one with the best Cash flow. This scenario \n\n\n\n75 \n \n\n \n \n\npresented a local minimum in the water cut parameters, therefore not followed the \n\nbehavior expected. \n\nRegarding the surfactant percentage, it was observed in Figure 6.3.3.2-3 that the \n\ntendency followed by both chemicals is the same, to reduce their associated costs. \n\nHowever, the interfacial tension reduction was kept as can be observed in  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.3.3.2-4 where at the beginning, a front of low interfacial tension is formed \n\n(microemulsion), and it moves across all the model until reaching the producers, \n\nwhich has an effect of increasing the oil recovered while moving at the same time \n\noriginal water saturation. This movement of oil and formation brine is what \n\nincrements the water produced when compared against the polymer flooding results \n\non section 6.3.1. \n\nFigure 6.3.3.2-3 Surfactant concentration versus polymer concentration injected \n\non the Surfactant-polymer flooding for all three geological and a probable \n\neconomic scenario. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\n \n\n\n\n76 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.3.3.2-4 Interfacial tension o-w, two years (left) and after 9 years (right). \n\n  \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nOn the contrary, the minimum average pressure on the reservoir at which the \n\ninjection well should be opened follows an opposite tendency, so a lower pressure \n\nmeans more time producing under no injection with the own reservoir energy. From \n\nFigure 6.3.3.2-5, it can be observed that the optimum moment to start the injection \n\nis in a range close to 6100 to 7000 psi, with an average of 6380 psi (Table 6.3.3.2-1 \n\nOptimized parameters for Surfactant-polymer flooding per model and economic \n\nscenario.Table 6.3.3.2-1), values over the bubble point pressure where the injection \n\npresents higher efficiency as does not have to fill a gas layer. \n\nFigure 6.3.3.2-5 Effects of the Minimum average reservoir pressure to start \n\ninjection on the NPV for three geological models and a probable scenario. \n\n\n\n77 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nOn Figure 6.3.3.2-6 can be observed the box plots for each economic \n\nscenario and model for the salinity content of the chemical batch, where the \n\ntendency of the salt concentration of the brine carrying the surfactant was to go lower \n\nthan the optimal value (60000ppm). Indicating the preference of a negative gradient \n\ninjection program, based on the salinity content.  \n\nFigure 6.3.3.2-6 Chemical batch salt content per model and economic scenario. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nMoreover, Table 6.3.3.2-1, are found the optimized parameters for the \n\noptimistic and pessimistic scenarios. Where similar to the probable scenario, the \n\nhigher the permeability the higher the NPV. Another tendency that can be observed \n\nis that the low permeability model in all cases had the larger pore volumes injected, \n\n\n\n78 \n \n\n \n \n\nindicating higher volumes of the chemical slug are required to achieve higher oil \n\nrecoveries as the permeability is lowered, specifically higher quantities of surfactant. \n\nTaking into a count the optimal values of table Table 6.3.3.2-1, it can be \n\nobserved that a negative gradient of salt injection is being followed, the first batch in \n\n8 of the 9 cases had salt content under its optimal value of 60000 ppm, while the \n\nwater injection which followed the chemical batch presented in 5 of 9 cases under \n\noptimal conditions too. This behavior is explained as in reservoir conditions the salt \n\ncontent of the formation brine is much higher than the optimal value; therefore the \n\ninjection scheme must take into account the creation of a salinity mix between \n\nformation and injection waters (HIRASAKI; MILLER; PUERTO, 2011).  \n\n6.3.4. Expected Monetary Value (EMV) Lula \n\nThe Expected Monetary Value for the waterflooding, polymer flooding and \n\nSurfactant-polymer flooding including the NPV of all three economic scenarios and \n\nall three heterogeneous models were 69.9  MMUSD, 58.8 MMUSD, and 49.2 \n\nMMUSD respectively (Table 6.3.4-1, Table 6.3.4-2 and Table 6.3.4-3). Therefore, \n\nwith a difference of 16% and 30%, the water flooding it\u2019s the best injection program \n\nfor the inverted five-spot model representing the Lula Field properties. The largest \n\ndifference of 26% and 40% against PF and SP respectively is encountered on the \n\nlow permeability model corresponding to a reservoir with 200mD as average \n\npermeability. Finding that matches with the common criteria that low permeability \n\nreservoirs are less preferable for chemical EOR projects that employ polymer as \n\nviscosifying agent (TABER; MARTIN; SERIGHT, 1997b; DICKSON; LEAHY-DIOS; \n\nWYLIE, 2010; AL ADASANI; BAI, 2011). \n\nTable 6.3.4-1 NPVs and resulting EMVs for a waterflooding program \n\nWaterflooding NPV (MMUSD)  \n\nModel Probability \nOptimistic Probable Pessimistic  \n\n30% 40% 30%  \n\n\n\n79 \n \n\n \n \n\nBase 40% 232 52 -60 29 \n\nHigh 30% 256 73 -44 28 \n\nLow 30% 193 24 -81 13 \n    EMV 69.9 \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 6.3.4-2 NPVs and resulting EMVs for a polymer flooding program.  \n\nPolymer Flooding NPV (MMUSD)  \n\nModel Probability \nOptimistic Probable Pessimistic  \n\n30% 40% 30%  \n\nBase 40% 223 41 -72 25 \n\nHigh 30% 246 61 -57 24 \n\nLow 30% 183 13 -94 10 \n    EMV 58.8 \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nTable 6.3.4-3 NPVs and resulting EMVs for a Surfactant-Polymer flooding \n\nprogram.  \n\nSurfactant-Polymer Flooding NPV (MMUSD)  \n\nModel Probability \nOptimistic Probable Pessimistic  \n\n30% 40% 30%  \n\nBase 40% 222 42 -84 23 \n\nHigh 30% 236 41 -79 19 \n\nLow 30% 178 5 -110 7 \n    EMV 49.2 \n\n\n\n80 \n \n\n \n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nFigure 6.3.4-1 Risk curve for all IOR methods based on the individual NPV for the \n\nLula model. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nEvaluating the risk curve in Figure 6.3.4-1, there is a 45% chance of any of \n\nthe projects being a failure under an economic evaluation.

CERENA I INVERTED FIVE SPOT MODEL SIMULATION RESULTS \n\nThe results for the IFS Cerena I model are detailed in the next sections. \n\n6.4.1. Comparison between IOR methods - Economic Scenarios \n\n \n\nIn Table 6.4.1-1 shows the results obtained for the optimization of the IOR \n\nprojects. It can be noticed that both polymer flooding and surfactant-polymer \n\nfloodings reduced the volume of water produced and gave an incremental on oil \n\nproduced while maintaining an incremental of NPV in the project\u2019s life. The behavior \n\nof both chemical injections was similar, final water cut of the filed, oil recovery factor \n\nand total oil produced were not significantly different. Both programs, by slowing the \n\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\n\n100%\n\n-130 -100 -70 -40 -10 20 50 80 110 140 170 200 230 260\n\nC\nu\n\nm\nu\n\nla\nti\n\nv\ne\n\n P\nro\n\nb\na\n\nb\nil\n\nit\ny\n\nNPV (US$ millions)\n\nWF PF SP\n\n\n\n81 \n \n\n \n \n\nincrement of the water phase (water cut) during the project\u2019s life, resulted in a \n\nreduction of the water treatment costs compensating the chemical investments. The \n\nsimilarity in their results pointed out that the surfactant was not playing a key role in \n\nthe behavior of the SP flooding, despite it increased the oil recovery.  \n\nIt can be observed a similar tendency as the one was presented in the \n\nprevious discussion for the Lula project. Both chemical injections recovered more oil \n\nwhile reducing water treatment costs and injection costs, impacting therefore not \n\nonly the technical performance of the field but also the economical. it was observed \n\nthat in all economic scenarios both chemical methods brought higher profits than \n\nWF. Moreover, the chemical cost was compensated due to the reduction of water \n\ninjection and production, both characteristics of a polymer injection. Another fact that \n\nmust be pointed when comparing PF and SP it\u2019s that the individual polymer cost of \n\nthe PF in 6 of 9 the cases is less than the surfactant plus polymer costs of the SP, \n\nbut the NPV of the SP cases are higher, as the main factor improving it were the \n\nreduction of water injected and the water produced plus the additional recovery. \n\nAlso, the consumption of polymer is less in 8 of 9 the cases for the SP than the PF, \n\nmeaning that the synergy between both chemicals reduced the amount required of \n\npolymer in a Chemical EOR program. This phenomenon happened when the \n\nsurfactant reduced the interfacial tension between the phases and improves the \n\nmobility of the fluid injected by altering the relative permeability curves. \n\nTable 6.4.1-2 Results for Cerena IFS. \n\nM\no\n\nd\ne\nl \n\nScenario IOR \nOil \n\nProduction \n(MMm3) \n\nWater \nproduction \n\nMMm3) \n\nWater \ninjection \n(MMm3) \n\nPeriod \n(Years) \n\nPolymer \nCost \n\n(MMUSD) \n\nSurfactant \nCost \n\n(MMUSD) \n\nNPV \n(MMUSD) \n\nRF \n(%) \n\nFinal \nWCut \n(%) \n\nB\nA\n\nS\nE\n\n \n\n70 WF 166 113 106 30 - - 10260 54% 74% \n\n70 PF 177 98.4 6 30 6.9 - 10558 58% 51% \n\n70 SP 180 94.7 1.54 30 2.5 2.2 10868 59% 52% \n\n50 WF 165 111 106 30 - - 6226 54% 72% \n\n50 PF 177 98 2 30 4.2 - 6416 58% 50% \n\n50 SP 181 95 1.65 30 5.0 2.7 6614 59% 52% \n\n40 WF 151 100 115 27 - - 3565 49% 65% \n\n40 PF 177 99 12 30 7.7 - 3860 58% 52% \n\n40 SP 180 94 0.9 30 3.0 1.1 4015 59% 51% \n\n\n\n82 \n \n\n \n \n\nL\nO\n\nW\n \n\n70 WF 167 106 76.1 30 - - 10069 54% 60% \n\n70 PF 171 92.7 8.7 30 5.2 - 10258 56% 46% \n\n70 SP 174 88.4 0.55 30 1.7 3.9 10618 57% 48% \n\n50 WF 170 106 56.5 30 - - 6175 55% 59% \n\n50 PF 171 93.3 2.38 30 3.6 - 6216 56% 47% \n\n50 SP 175 92.1 2.54 30 2.5 28.4 6458 57% 53% \n\n40 WF 170 106 56.5 30 - - 3710 55% 59% \n\n40 PF 172 93.5 2 30 4.8 - 3723 55% 47% \n\n40 SP 174 88.4 0.58 30 1.9 0.7 3898 57% 48% \n\nH\nIG\n\nH\n \n\n70 WF 160 107 101 28.8 - - 10239 52% 70% \n\n70 PF 179 99.5 2.98 30 9.35 - 10700 58% 53% \n\n70 SP 182 96.3 1.63 30 5.2 8.9 10954 59% 53% \n\n50 WF 162 112 109 29.5 - - 6235 53% 74% \n\n50 PF 179 99.6 6.7 30 11.5 - 6494 58% 52% \n\n50 SP 182 96.3 1.87 30 5.6 8.9 6678 59% 53% \n\n40 WF 159 107 100 28.7 - - 3744 52% 69% \n\n40 PF 179 99.5 3.2 30 8.2 - 3931 58% 53% \n\n40 SP 182 96.6 3.24 30 4.9 3.9 4055 59% 53% \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nAdditionally, it must be noticed that for the low permeability model, the \n\ncumulative water injection tended in almost all cases and IOR projects to be reduced \n\nwhen compared with the other models, as the injection goes affected negatively by \n\nthe polymer viscosity. Therefore, higher permeability rocks can be better objectives \n\nfor a polymer-based program, either by itself or with other chemicals as a surfactant \n\nor an alkaline matching the same conclusion of the Lula model and what different \n\nauthors in their screening criteria have mentioned  (TABER; MARTIN; SERIGHT, \n\n1997b; DICKSON; LEAHY-DIOS; WYLIE, 2010; AL ADASANI; BAI, 2011). \n\n6.4.2. Comparison of IOR methods - geological models \n\nBecause low permeability zones often present smaller pore throats that may \n\nbe plugged by the polymer molecules and injectivity problems due to the high \n\nviscosity of the fluid injected, reservoirs too tight are not common in the literature.  \n\n\n\n83 \n \n\n \n \n\nIn Figure 6.4.2-1 are represented the water cut curves for all the three models \n\nand all three injections. As can be observed, the water cut behavior of the three \n\nmodels for the WF differed significantly from the chemical floodings, reaching higher \n\npoints at similar production periods; moreover the rate at how the slope grew was \n\nhigher for the water injection in all three models, a behavior expected when \n\nchanneling and faster breakthrough happens. The breakthrough for all three models \n\noccurs between 2028 to 2032 in the WF, see Figure 6.4.2-2.  \n\nIn Figure 6.4.2-2 can be confirmed that low permeability models were not the \n\npreferred medium for a polymer-based injection program, as the oil production rates \n\nbehaves in the same way as for the water injection, the water cut increased and the \n\nchemical addition did not generate any reduction. Also, in Figure 6.4.2-2, it can be \n\nobserved that with higher values of permeability, even when it is not a norm, higher \n\nproduction rates, therefore, larger produced volumes. \n\nMoreover, in the same Figure 6.4.2-2, can be observed a fall in the water rate \n\nfor all the three models for the PF and SP, being more drastically in the low and base \n\npermeability models. This behavior is explained by the viscosifying action of the \n\npolymer which reduces the channeling of the water injected and reduced the water \n\nproduction of the more aqueous zones. \n\nFigure 6.4.2-1 Water cut curves for all three heterogeneity models for both \n\nchemicals flooding at the probable economic scenario. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\n\n\n84 \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.4.2-2 Oil and water rate areas per models and injection program. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019  \n\nAs shown on models Table 6.4.2-1 and Source: Author, 2019, the pore \n\nvolume injected is less than planned by the optimizer, as it will be mentioned in the \n\n6.4.3 section.

Parameters optimization \n\nAll the field development programs: water, polymer, and surfactant-polymer \n\nfloodings were optimized for all economic and geological scenarios. This way a \n\nbalanced comparison could be performed between the IOR methodologies. Next, it \n\nis discussed how the parameters behaved on the chemical injections. \n\nFor the Inverted five spot based on the Cerena I reservoir, the parameters in \n\nTable 6.4.3-1 won\u2019t be deeply analyzed on this research despite that at the \n\nbeginning were selected, mainly because these parameters presented behaviors not \n\nexpected and not conclusive, requiring therefore further studies.  \n\nTable 6.4.3-1 Inconclusive parameters optimized for the Cerena-IFS models and \n\nIOR methods.  \n\nIOR  Constraint Initial Max Min \n\nAll Min production Bottom hole pressure (kPa) 45400 50000 20000 \n\nAll Max Fluid production rate (m3/day)  4769.62 6359.5 1589.87 \n\nSP Polymer Concentration on chase slug (ppm) 1000 3000 500 \n\nSP Salt concentration chase slug (ppm) 50000 100000 20000 \n\n\n\n86 \n \n\n \n \n\nPF, SP Pore Volumes injected: chemical batch 0.5 0.5 0.15 \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nThe first two variables on Table 6.4.3-1, minimum BHP and max fluid rate for \n\neach producer well, followed the same tendencies for all economic scenarios and \n\nreservoir models: maximizing the fluid rate an minimizing the bottom hole pressure. \n\nBoth parameters are interdepended and were evaluated simultaneously as having \n\nthe same issues. First, as the production platform cost on this economic evaluation \n\nwas fixed and it did not vary depending on the fluid production of the wells, the \n\noptimizer maximizes the fluid rate without having an economic parameter that \n\ncontrolled its performance directly. Second, the model did not contemplate the \n\nexistence of flow efficiency phenomena that affect the wells such as skin or formation \n\ndamage, therefore the well followed a simplified \u201cProductivity Index\u201d behavior, \n\ndefined as \u201cthe volume delivered per psi of drawdown at the sand face (BPD/psi)\u201d \n\n(SCHLUMBERGER LIMITED, 2018) meaning that theoretically the maximum oil \n\nproduction was achieved at the largest drawdown or 0 psi of flowing pressure. For \n\nthis research, the parameters always tended to the minimum bottom hole pressure \n\nof 20000 kPa and the maximum production rate of 6359.5 m3/day.  \n\nBoth tendencies can be found in Figure 6.4.3-1 and Figure 6.4.3-2 whereas \n\nmentioned the fluid rate tends to maximize and the bottom hole pressure to minimize \n\nfollowing an ideal behavior. \n\nFigure 6.4.3-1 Maximum fluid rate tendency for the Cerena-I IFS. \n\n\n\n87 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nFigure 6.4.3-2 Minimum bottom hole pressure tendency for the Cerena-I IFS. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nRegarding the other three parameters: polymer/salt concentration in the \n\nchase slug and pore volume injected, the displacing slug was not injected in any of \n\nthe Cerena models, because the pore volume injected of the main slug never \n\nachieved the minimum value to start the second one. All the injections ended in less \n\nthan 0.1 PV after reaching the simulation limit of 30 years.  \n\nFor the PF and SP the injection rates were lower than the expected, less than ten \n\ntime the water, due to the low injectivity of the formation, low permeability layers \n\nbelow 100 mD, and high viscosity of the fluid injected, both can be observed in \n\n\n\n88 \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.4.3-4 and Figure 6.4.3-5. The injection rate was low for the SP despite the \n\npressure at the bottom of the hole is at its maximum, the same set as for the WF, \n\nsee Figure 6.4.3-3. \n\nMoreover in Figure 6.4.3-4, it can be noticed that the solution viscosity is higher \n\naround the injector at the end of the simulation reaching values up to 70 cp (the \n\npolymer starts to disperse and it losses the viscosity after this front) and in part \u201cB\u201d \n\nof the same figure, it can be noticed that the interfacial tension was reduced and it \n\naffected a large area of the sector. However, it is requiring longer PVs injected as to \n\nobserve a bigger effect on the incremental oil recovery than the one presented in all \n\nthe models. \n\nFigure 6.4.3-3 Pressure and injection rate for the Base model, the probable \nscenario of WF and SP flooding. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nFigure 6.4.3-4 Properties in the High model probable scenario, end of simulation \n\nA) solution viscosity; B) Aerial view of interfacial tension layer 121. \n\n0\n\n15000\n\n30000\n\n45000\n\n60000\n\n75000\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n10000\n\n100000\n\n0 3000 6000 9000 12000\n\nP\nre\n\ns\ns\nu\nre\n\n (\nk\nP\n\na\n)\n\nF\nlu\n\nid\n r\n\na\nte\n\n (\nm\n\n3\n/d\n\na\ny\n)\n\nDays\n\nInj Rate SP Inj Rate WF Inj BHP SP Inj BHP WF\n\n\n\n89 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nFigure 6.4.3-5 Permeability I md, in base model A) layer I:10 plane cut JK; B) J:10 \nplane cut IK \n\n \nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nAlso, the profile of injection despite not moving in a large area, observed an \n\nuniform vertical displacement, which has been reported in the literature for polymer \n\ninjection  (SHENG, 2011; SHENG; LEONHARDT; AZRI, 2015). \n\n6.4.3.1. Polymer flooding parameters \n\nIn Table 6.4.3-1, it can be found the optimized parameters for all geological \n\nmodels and three economic scenarios. Regarding the polymer concentration, the \n\noptimal values were in the middle region of the range given to the optimizer. What \n\nmatches with the section 6.4.3 analysis of the low injection rate, in this case the \n\npolymer concentration went up as to reduce the volume injected while still displacing \n\n\n\n90 \n \n\n \n \n\nthe oil. There was no tendency as to have lower or larger concentrations depending \n\non the model, however, on Figure 6.4.3.1-1 can be noticed that for all three models \n\nthe range went between 1000 to 2000 ppm, where the optimal values fell. The \n\nchemical cost was paid by the incremental oil of the PF strategy, different from the \n\nobserved in the Lula\u2019s model were all the values went to the low range close to 500 \n\nppm. \n\nTable 6.4.3.1-1 Optimized parameters for polymer flooding per model and \neconomic scenario. \n\nScenario 50  40 70 50 40 70 50 40 70 \n\nParameter BASE BASE BASE HIGH HIGH HIGH LOW LOW LOW \n\nWCUT1 77.3% 93.2% 84.1% 89.4% 74.1% 70.0% 94.1% 99.0% 78.1% \n\nWCUT2 90.7% 83.3% 70.0% 82.5% 99.0% 88.0% 77.4% 77.3% 82.5% \n\nWCUT3 87.3% 71.2% 99.0% 74.6% 70.0% 84.5% 83.1% 91.8% 74.4% \n\nWCUT4 70.0% 91.8% 73.5% 99.0% 79.0% 70.0% 70.0% 70.0% 97.8% \n\nInjection Trigger (psi) 40000 43350 46700 47100 40000 40000 45600 50000 46350 \n\nPV Injected 0.06 0.07 0.07 0.07 0.06 0.06 0.06 0.06 0.07 \n\nppm Pol 2023 612 1162 1711 2322 2994 1524 2197 574 \n\nNPV (MMUSD) 6416 3860 10558 6494 3931 10700 6216 3723 10258 \n\n% Delta NPV 3.1% 8.3% 2.9% 4.1% 5.0% 4.5% 0.7% 0.3% 1.9% \n\nOil RF 57.6% 57.6% 57.6% 58.1% 58.2% 58.2% 55.6% 55.4% 55.7% \n\nIncremental FR 3.9% 8.5% 3.7% 5.6% 6.4% 6.3% 0.3% 0.1% 1.4% \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nBased on Table 6.4.3-1, it can be noticed that with higher average \n\npermeability, the higher its NPV and RF, explained by Darcy\u2019s equation, where a \n\nlarger permeability means higher fluid rates that resulted in the NPV and incremental \n\nRF observed. Also, the water cut to shut the wells varies between the models, having \n\nhigher final water cuts for the High model: if a final water cut is selected for all wells, \n\nin average it would be 81.15%<81.33%<86.38% for the low, base, and high models \n\nrespectively.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.4.3.1-1 NPV versus polymer concentration injected on the polymer \n\nflooding for all three geological and a probable economic scenario. \n\n\n\n91 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nAbout the minimum average pressure on the reservoir at which the injection \n\nwell should be opened has three ranges, one for each reservoir model, resulting in \n\na range of 40000 to 50000 kPa, therefore it is a variable that must be evaluated for \n\neach case as it depends on every set of variables per model (Figure 6.4.3.1-2).  \n\nFigure 6.4.3.1-2 Effects of the Minimum average reservoir pressure to start \n\ninjection on the NPV for each geological model in the probable economic scenario. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nif needed operatively, the water cut to shut in the wells could be selected close \n\nto 83% - 84%, Figure 6.4.3.1-3 and Figure 6.4.3.1-4, meaning that for any economic \n\nscenario and model this parameter could be fixed for all the well group in this range. \n\nHowever, as recommended for Lula\u2019s model, it is a parameter that should be \n\n\n\n92 \n \n\n \n \n\nevaluated per well and operational conditions as it presented dispersion of the data \n\nfrom 93% to 76%.  \n\nRegarding the reservoir pressure to start the injection, all three models differ \n\nindividually between economic scenarios, shown in Figure 6.4.3.1-2, Figure \n\n6.4.3.1-7 and Figure 6.4.3.1-8. The base model, probable and pessimistic tend to \n\nhave a pressure lower than 45000 kPa; for the high model optimistic and probable \n\ntend to 40000 kPa, and the low model it\u2019s the one that has a tendency in all three \n\neconomic scenarios to start the injection as earlier as possible over 45000 kPa. The \n\nlast behavior can be explained, when evaluating that this model it\u2019s the one with \n\nlarger problems of injectivity due to its overall lower permeability, therefore it requires \n\nto start earlier the injection as to compensate during the 30 years program the \n\nchemical investment.  \n\nThe tendencies of the probable and pessimistic scenarios were similar and \n\ndiffer from the optimistic. Which lead to the idea that with better economic scenarios \n\n(higher oil prices) could be best to let the reservoir deplete by their own energy \n\nlonger, therefore less investment, and later incorporate more reserves with IOR \n\nprograms. \n\n\n\n93 \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.4.3.1-3 Water cut optimization at an optimistic economic scenario for all \nproducers for polymer flooding. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\n  \n\nFigure 6.4.3.1-4 Water cut optimization at a pessimistic economic scenario on all \n\nfour producers for polymer flooding. \n\n  \nSource: Author, 2019 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n94 \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.4.3.1-5 NPV versus polymer concentration injected on the polymer \n\nflooding for all three geological and the optimistic economic scenario. \n\n \nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nFigure 6.4.3.1-6 NPV versus polymer concentration injected on the polymer \n\nflooding for all three geological and the pessimistic economic scenario. \n\n \nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nFigure 6.4.3.1-7  NPV versus Minimum average reservoir pressure to start \n\ninjection for each geological model in the pessimistic economic scenario. \n\n \nSource: Author, 2019 \n\n\n\n95 \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.4.3.1-8 Effects of the Minimum average reservoir pressure to start \n\ninjection on the NPV for each geological model in the optimistic economic scenario. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\n6.4.3.2.

Explained the same way as for the PF, \n\nincreasing the injected fluid viscosity reduced the fluid volume in the higher \n\npermeability layers which lower the injected fluid cost and treatment as it worked as \n\na conformance corrector.  \n\nWhile the surfactant concentration was affected for the economic scenario, \n\nthe lower price presented lower quantities, and the optimistic economic scenario \n\nallowed the upper concentrations. Similar to the observed in the Lula\u2019s simulations, \n\nthe oil price affects the economy of the CEOR projects, but in this case as the Cerena \n\nmodels were able to compensate the cost, higher quantities were injected. However \n\nthe tendency was not clear between models as observed in Figure 6.4.3.2-3, the \n\nbase model tend to be on the lower range between 0.2 to 0.05 %, the high model \n\ntends to be on the upper side between 0.35 and 0.5%, while the low model does not \n\nhave a range as its concentration moves between all the range defined for the \n\noptimization, 0.05% to 0.5%. \n\nThe salt concentration based one more time in Figure 6.4.3.2-3, had a \n\ntendency to be injected in lower concentrations (under 60000 ppm) for the low and \n\nhigh model, while the base goes in all the range optimized. Leading to the idea that \n\nthe salt it\u2019s a parameter with interaction effects as its tendency was not marked \n\nbetween models. Moreover, the low model tended to have local extrema issues on \n\nthis variable as in this graph the points stay in a straight line the same in all the \n\nrange; therefore it was not conclusive and led to question the result for the surfactant \n\nconcentration as it depended significantly on the salt content.   \n\nFocusing on the average reservoir pressure to start the injection, almost in all \n\nthe scenarios the optimal value was the lowest reservoir pressure constraint, 4000 \n\npsi. This strategy reduces the quantity of chemical injected and then reduces the \n\ncosts in the long run of the project, Figure 6.4.3.2-4. \n\n\n\n97 \n \n\n \n \n\nRegarding the water cut to shut in the wells, when observing the optimized \n\nparameters in Table 6.4.3.2-1, the idea of early closing the wells was supported as \n\n8 of the 12 water cuts is lower than 75%. However, in Figure 6.4.3.2-5 the \n\ntendencies can be divided, the wells 3 and 4 benefited of earlier closures while the \n\nproducers 1 and 2 tended to be on a larger range; therefore, they must be evaluated \n\nindividually and their interactions with polymer and surfactant concentration. \n\nFigure 6.4.3.2-1  Effects of the Minimum average reservoir pressure to start \n\ninjection on the NPV for each geological model in the pessimistic scenario. \n\n \nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nFigure 6.4.3.2-2 Effects of the Minimum average reservoir pressure to start \n\ninjection on the NPV for each geological model in the optimistic economic scenario. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\n\n\n98 \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.4.3.2-3 Surfactant concentration versus salt concentration injected on the \n\nSP flooding for each geological model in the probable economic scenario. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nFigure 6.4.3.2-4 Effects of the Minimum average reservoir pressure to start \n\ninjection on the NPV for each geological model in the probable economic scenario. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n99 \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.4.3.2-5 Water cut optimization at a probable economic scenario for all \n\nproducers in the SP flooding. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nThe surfactant and salt concentrations were clearer on the optimistic and \n\npessimistic scenarios than for the probable. In Figure 6.4.3.2-6 and Figure \n\n6.4.3.2-7, it can be observed that higher surfactant concentrations were injected with \n\nbrines with lower salt content, and the opposite applies. As mentioned in the Lula \n\ncase, the preferable injection of salt according to the literature is a gradient injection \n\nwhich makes a contrast with the high salinity encountered in the reservoir. In Figure \n\n6.4.3.2-7 the high salinity brine with low surfactant concentration indicated that on \n\nthe pessimist scenario the surfactant was not the main chemical agent, but the \n\npolymer was, as with higher salt concentrations the reduction of interfacial was not \n\noptimal (close to 60000 ppm). A reduction of surfactant cost was encountered, \n\ntherefore on the pessimistic scenario. \n\nSalt concentration per model can also be observed in Figure 6.4.3.2-8, where \n\nthe average was found disregarding the economic scenario. Being on this graph \n\nwhere the tendency was clearer, the salt concentration was close to the optimal \n\nvalue mentioned on the input section and lab results of 60000 ppm NaCl (HIRASAKI; \n\nMILLER; PUERTO, 2011), where the IFT was minimal for all surfactant \n\nconcentrations. \n\n\n\n100 \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.4.3.2-6 Surfactant concentration versus salt concentration injected on the \n\nSurfactant-polymer flooding for each geological model in the optimistic scenario. \n\n \nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nFigure 6.4.3.2-7 Surfactant concentration versus salt concentration injected on the \n\nSurfactant-polymer flooding for each geological model in the pessimistic scenario. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nThe surfactant concentration behavior also can be found in Figure 6.4.3.2-9, \n\nthis time as a function of the economic scenario.  The surfactant concentration \n\ndepends on the economics of the project, and the higher concentrations were \n\nencountered in the optimistic scenario and the minimum percentages on the \n\ncontrary, in the more pessimistic scenario. This can be confirmed as the average of \n\nthe optimal surfactant concentration for the pessimistic scenario is 0.05%, for the \n\nprobable scenario 0.16% and for the optimistic 0.32%. As mentioned before, at \n\n\n\n101 \n \n\n \n \n\nhigher oil prices, the economy of CEOR projects can compensate their costs and \n\ntherefore higher concentrations on the brine injected. \n\nFigure 6.4.3.2-8 Salt content tendency per model on the SP flooding. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nFigure 6.4.3.2-9 Surfactant concentration per economic scenario on the SP \n\nflooding. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nFinally, it must be noticed that despite the low injectivity of this chemical \n\nsolution, there was sweep and effect of the surfactant addition in the models. In \n\nFigure 6.4.3.2-10, the (a) section cut shows the fraction of the surfactant that had \n\nbeen adsorbed in the layer observed for the low model, which was in average 1% \n\nwhile the (b) section cut shows the same layer for the high model, with an average \n\nof adsorption of 10%. First, it should be pointed out that higher permeability \n\nreservoirs do increase the oil recoveries and bring higher fluid rates, they require \n\nlarger volumes of chemical injected to compensate the adsorption. With this results, \n\n\n\n102 \n \n\n \n \n\nit can be discarded losses of surfactant as an issue on the performance of the \n\ntechnique inside of the reservoir, additionally, the area that covered went from the \n\ncenter to the producers indicating a good movement of the surfactant through the \n\nreservoir especially in the direction of producers 1 and 2. This movement indicated \n\nthat in this wells, if a surface facility was built, they will be the first requiring \n\nmicroemulsion treatments because of the arrival of the emulsion front (LEVITT et al., \n\n2013). Moreover, the incremental oil volumes given by the SP when compared to \n\nthe PF were related to this IFT reduction. \n\nFigure 6.4.3.2-10 Adsorption as a fraction of surfactant injected, for the SP \n\nflooding (a) optimistic scenario low permeability model, (b) probable scenario high \n\npermeability model. \n\n  \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\n6.4.4. Expected Monetary Value (EMV) Cerena I \n\nIn Table 6.4.4-1, Table 6.4.4-2 and Table 6.4.4-3 have the EVM for each \n\ninjection program according to the probability assigned for each case. As can be \n\nobserved, the EMV for SP flooding was the higher of all three, followed by the PF.  \n\nIn Figure 6.4.4-1, the optimized results for both chemical injections are \n\nshown, relating: cumulative oil production, final water cut, recovery factor, economic \n\n\n\n103 \n \n\n \n \n\nmodel and NPV. It can be observed that the best economic results are obtained on \n\nthe models where the final water cut after the 30 years of all the field production are \n\nbetween 50% and 65%, showing that optimizing the wells shut-in by its water cut \n\ncan benefit the cash flow of a chemical recovery project. Moreover, the PF and the \n\nSP can increase the cumulative oil production overall models and scenarios, \n\nespecially on a low barrel price scenario, when comparing against the WF. It can be \n\nnoted that the NPV difference between methods gets higher on optimistic scenarios, \n\nmeaning that higher oil prices benefit the implementation of chemical EOR programs \n\nsuch as PF and SP. \n\nFigure 6.4.4-1 Results of optimal cases. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nTable 6.4.4-1 NPVs and resulting EMVs for a water flooding program.  \n\nWater flooding NPV (MMUSD)  \n\nModel Probability \nOptimistic Probable Pessimistic  \n\n30% 40% 30%  \n\nBase 40% 10,260 6,226 3,565  2,655  \n\nHigh 30% 10,239 6,235 3,744  2,007  \n\nLow 30% 10,069 6,175 3,710  1,981   \n \n\n \nEMV (MMUSD)  6,643  \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n104 \n \n\n \n \n\nTable 6.4.4-2 NPVs and resulting EMVs for a polymer flooding program.  \n\nPolymer Flooding NPV (MMUSD)  \n\nModel Probability \nOptimistic Probable Pessimistic  \n\n30% 40% 30%  \n\nBase 40% 10,558 6,416 3,860  2,757  \n\nHigh 30% 10,700 6,494 3,931  2,096  \n\nLow 30% 10,258 6,216 3,723  2,004   \n \n\n \nEMV (MMUSD)  6,857  \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nTable 6.4.4-3 NPVs and resulting EMVs for a Surfactant-Polymer flooding \n\nprogram.  \n\nSurfactant-Polymer Flooding NPV (MMUSD)  \n\nModel Probability \nOptimistic Probable Pessimistic  \n\n30% 40% 30%  \n\nBase 40% 10,868 6,614 4,015  2,844  \n\nHigh 30% 10,954 6,678 4,055  2,152  \n\nLow 30% 10,618 6,458 3,898  2,081   \n \n\n \nEMV (MMUSD)  7,078  \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\n6.5. MODEL RESULTS VERSUS CARBONATE FIELD APPLICATION \n\nREPORTS \n\nThe results of this research for the Cerena-I model can be compared to \n\nfindings of real field applications (the Lula model had an EMV lower for SP and PF \n\nthan WF, therefore, is not compared). The most recent report of SP injection was the \n\nSingle Well Tracer Test of an offshore carbonate reservoir in Abu Dhabi (AL-AMRIE \n\net al., 2015). Both, their research and the present agreed on: salinity brine for the \n\nchemical injection lower than the one encountered at reservoir conditions it is \n\npreferential. Six of nine of the optimal scenarios on this research showed a salinity \n\nconcentration under 70000 ppm (Table 6.5-1), less than formation water, 104361 \n\nppm (HIRASAKI; MILLER; PUERTO, 2011). Additionally, the objective reservoir \n\n\n\n105 \n \n\n \n \n\nlayers despite having a positive response on incremental recovery, the polymer \n\nsolution presented injectivity problems reducing the injection rate to less than10% of \n\nits initial conditions with water. This flow resistance behavior has been observed in \n\nthe Shengli pilot (ZHENQUAN et al., 2013) and other simulation reports (DANG et \n\nal., 2015). \n\nHowever, the incremental oil recovery factor of the SP flooding despite being \n\npositive when compared to a conventional water injection, from 0.1 to 9.5%, the field \n\nresults of some pilots are even higher, as an example the pilot performed on the \n\nShengli field gave an incremental of 16.7% (ZHENQUAN et al., 2013) and the pilot \n\non the Minas field (BOU-MIKAEL et al., 2000), an incremental of 20% \u2014 proving that \n\nfield results can differ on from simulation results. \n\nTable 6.5-1 Optimal salinity concentrations for SP flooding.  \n\nModel Scenario \nNaCl Content \n\n(ppm) \n\nBase \n\nProbable 66176 \n\nPessimistic 100000 \n\nOptimistic 20000 \n\nHigh \n\nProbable 45640 \n\nPessimistic 100000 \n\nOptimistic 55653 \n\nLow \n\nProbable 20000 \n\nPessimistic 64778 \n\nOptimistic 100000 \n\nSource: Author, 2019 \n\nRegarding the performance of the PF, if compared against some field cases, \n\nit can be seen in Figure 6.5-1 that this research result falls in a range of medium \n\nperformance, having a low quantity of polymer injected and low and medium \n\nincremental recoveries compared with real field data (SHENG; LEONHARDT; AZRI, \n\n2015). Better performance than the ones obtained for the Lula model explained as \n\nthe oil encountered on it has higher API gravity resulting in less dense fluid with lower \n\nviscosities, a condition not favorable for the polymer flooding (NEEDHAM; DOE, \n\n1987). \n\n\n\n106 \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.5-1 Polymer flooding performance of Cerena I against real field data. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019; SHENG; LEONHARDT; AZRI, 2015 \n\nRegarding the performance of the SP, as was mentioned previously the PV \n\ninjected was less than expected due to the low injectivity of the well. Additionally, it \n\nwas desired to compare how the CEOR methodology performed against other \n\nprojects. In Figure 6.5-2, it can be observed that the performance of the SP is far \n\nfrom being what would be expected as the incremental recoveries are not that high \n\nand the Surfactant quantity is less than some results of field applications. However, \n\nthe results tend to increase rapidly with low quantities of surfactant, having a \n\nsimilarity to the laboratory results. This tendency indicates that by solving the \n\ninjectivity issues and larger volumes of surfactant injected, a significant incremental \n\noil could be recovered (DEBONS; BRAUN; LEDOUX, 2004). \n\nMoreover, when comparing the results with the one obtained of Lula it can be \n\nmentioned that despite higher PV injected the incremental recovery is more or less \n\nthe same, indicating that the Cerena cases may increase even higher the oil \n\nrecovered and therefore the NPV if a solution for the low injectivity is defined. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0 200 400 600 800\n\nIn\nc\nre\n\nm\ne\n\nn\nta\n\nl \nO\n\nil\n r\n\ne\nc\no\nv\ne\n\nry\n \n\n(f\nra\n\nc\nti\no\nn\n\n)\n\nInjected Polymer (ppm*PV in fraction)\n\nField performance\n\nCerena-I performance\n\nLula Performance\n\n\n\n107 \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.5-2 Surfactant-Polymer flooding performance of Cerena-I against real \n\ndata. \n\n \n\nSource: Author, 2019; DEBONS; BRAUN; LEDOUX, 2004 \n\n \n\n  \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2\n\nIn\nc\nre\n\nm\ne\n\nn\nta\n\nl \nR\n\ne\nc\no\nv\ne\n\nry\n (\n\n%\n)\n\nSurfactant Quantity (PVxC)\n\nField Projects\n\nCerena-I Results\n\nLaboratory projects\n\n\n\n108 \n \n\n \n \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\nRegarding the laboratory evaluation: \n\n? Surfactants with low CMC, IFT, and adsorption are required for carbonate rocks, \n\nthe type of surfactant; therefore, it is different than the anionic surfactants \n\nemployed in sandstones. Non-ionic, cationic, or zwitterionic surfactants can be \n\nan answer to this requirement. \n\n? The Xanthan gum behaves as expected on high salinity brines, generating a \n\nbroad range of viscosities depending on its concentration.  \n\nRegarding the simulation evaluation of both models, Lula and Cerena-I:  \n\n? The economic cost of the chemical injection reduced the NPV of all scenarios in \n\nthe Lula IFS, despite increasing the oil recovery factor. Therefore, the associated \n\ncosts of CEOR program play a fundamental role in its applicability, a behavior \n\nobserved previously by Bahrami et al. (2016) and Kamari et al. (2016) \n\nresearches. \n\n? Surfactant-Polymer flooding is the oil recovery mechanism which provided the in \n\nall the cases the largest incremental recovery for both models.  \n\n? When to close a producer well for a Chemical EOR program varies between \n\neconomic scenario and models; however there is a tendency: the higher the oil \n\nprice is, the higher the water cut shut-in can be as higher oil prices allow larger \n\ntimes producing per well. \n\n? When to start a CEOR injection must be evaluated for each case. However, the \n\nLula Model presents a tendency to start the project as early as possible, a \n\nstatement previously visualized by Sheng (2011). In his research is observed that \n\nthe main reason as to delay a CEOR injection based on the polymer is the \n\neconomy of the project and the knowledge a company has over its reservoir. \n\n\n\n109 \n \n\n \n \n\n? Average permeability over 100 md is the best option to inject polymer according \n\nto this results, which Dickson et al. (2010) in his screening recommendation \n\nhighlights is the best option for this type of CEOR programs. \n\n? The brine salinity required for a surfactant injection must be at/under the optimal \n\nconcentration (~60000 ppm). Also, a negative gradient is the best \n\nrecommendation, a behavior, and recommendation previously done by Hirasaki; \n\nMiller and Puerto (2011). This behavior is explained as in reservoir conditions the \n\nsalt content of the formation brine is much higher than the optimal value; \n\ntherefore the injection scheme must take into account the salinity mix between \n\nformation and injection waters, a mixture which reaches concentrations close to \n\nthe optimal. \n\n? During PF and SP flooding it is possible to observe problems related to injectivity \n\nof the solution on low permeability reservoirs, due to the high viscosity of the \n\npolymer. This was observed previously in a field pilot on a carbonate reservoir \n\n(AL-AMRIE et al., 2015) and previously in a laboratory level (SERIGHT; \n\nSEHEULT; TALASHEK, 2009). \n\n? The associated treatment and chemical costs of a CEOR project impact its \n\nprofitability under any economic scenario. It requires then an implementation that \n\ntargets not only the incremental recovery of oil but also the overall cash flow of \n\nthe project (SHENG, 2011).   \n\n? The risk curve graphs showed that WF, PF, and SP are close in space. \n\nOptimizing either one methodology and associated costs will increase the gap \n\nbetween them. \n\n? For the Cerena-I models: the SP programs do increase the NPV and EMV when \n\ncompared to the PF however, the increment is not significant either in profitability \n\nor recovery factor (comparing between both CEOR methodologies). This can be \n\nexplained as an effect of low quantities of chemical injected due to injectivity \n\nproblem in the injector. Assumption confirmed when evaluating its performance \n\n\n\n110 \n \n\n \n \n\nagainst a pool of data relating surfactant quantities versus incremental recoveries \n\nand field results. Despite this result, it can be then expected on the other side \n\nthat if the models have larger volumes injected the recovery factor and its cash \n\nflow may increase, as there was an incremental recovery with very low volumes \n\nof chemical. \n\n? The Cerena-I sector presented injectivity problems when the chemical slug was \n\ninjected regardless of the permeability model, as a result of high pressures and \n\nhigh viscosity fluid. It must be studied possible solutions to this phenomenon as \n\nit makes difficult achieving the quantity of surfactant required to have large \n\nincrements of oil recovery by IFT reduction. One possibility not evaluated in this \n\nresearch it\u2019s changing the position of the vertical well or replacing it for a \n\ndirectional well avoiding the zones with lower injectivity. \n\n? For the Cerena-I model: the surfactant concentration depends on the economics \n\nof the project, the higher concentrations are encountered on the optimistic \n\nscenarios, and the minimum percentages are on the contrary on the more \n\npessimistic scenarios. This can be confirmed as the average of the optimal \n\nsurfactant concentration for the pessimistic scenario is 0.05%, for the probable \n\nscenario 0.16% and for the optimistic 0.32%. \n\nFUTURE WORKS \n\nNext, a list of ideas for future works based on this research: \n\n? Evaluate the performance of both CEOR methodologies in a real field model. \n\n? Evaluate the performance of both CEOR injections in coreflooding tests and \n\npreliminary evaluation and screening of chemical based on state of the art. \n\n? Evaluate the performance of other simulation alternatives such as proxy analysis, \n\nneural networks, and a combination of both as alternatives for CEOR evaluation. \n\n? Evaluate the performance of vertical wells versus horizontal, directional wells and \n\ntheir placement. \n\n? Evaluate the performance of other CEOR oil recovery mechanisms. \n\n\n\n111 \n \n\n \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nABDULLAH, M.; TIWARI, S.; PATHAK, A.
