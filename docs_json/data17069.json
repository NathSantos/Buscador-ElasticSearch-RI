Associated features indicate that the rheology of the bed varied from stiff during lodgement to\n\nsoft and deformable during ploughing. Poor drainage of meltwater at the glacier-bed interface may have\n\ncontributed to lower the strength of sediment to deformation.\n\nThe deformed interval was probably generated during a single glacial phase or advance of a glacier grounding\n\nin a marine or lacustrine water body. Changes in the dynamics of the glacier involving slow and fast flow\n\nwere correlated respectively with alternation of deposition and erosion. The proposed model is analogous to\n\nthat of lodgement till complexes from the Pleistocene of the northern hemisphere. Retreat of the glacier was\n\nprobably fast, followed by settling of muds on top of the upper striated and furrowed surface, and progradation\n\nof deltaic sands during post-glacial time.\n\nKey words: glacially striated surfaces, soft sediments, Itarar\u00e9 Subgroup, late Paleozoic.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSurfaces bearing furrows and striae formed on un-\n\nconsolidated sediments are relatively common fea-\n\ntures associated with diamictites and other rocks in\n\npre-Pleistocene glacigenic successions (see Wood-\n\nworth-Lynas and Dowdeswell 1994 for references).\n\n*Member Academia Brasileira de Ci\u00eancias\nCorrespondence to: Antonio C. Rocha-Campos\nE-mail: acrcampo@usp.br\n\nIn most localities the surfaces have been interpreted\n\nas resulting from the movement of a glacier across\n\nsoft beds, being thus subglacial features. Similar to\n\nhard rock striated pavements, the presence of stri-\n\nated surfaces is usually taken as one of the best\n\ncriteria for assigning a glacial origin to the asso-\n\nciated beds (Hambrey and Harland 1981, Crowell\n\n1999). Woodworth-Lynas and Dowdeswell (1994)\n\nhave pointed that many examples of striated sur-\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2005) 77 (2)\n\n\n\n368 IVO TROSDTORF JR. ET AL.\n\nfaces described in the literature correspond to fea-\n\ntures formed by the mechanical scouring of floating\n\nice on sea or lakebed and offer criteria for distin-\n\nguishing between the two types of structures.\n\nSoft sediment striated beds are herein desig-\n\nnated surfaces, in contrast with hard rock striated\n\npavements. The adjective striated is applied here in\n\na broad sense to designate bedding planes bearing\n\nstriae (positive and negative elements with relief up\n\nto few millimeters), furrows (negative features) and\n\nridges (positive features) with relief of more than a\n\nfew millimeters, of varied shapes, as well as other\n\nabrasional features.\n\nWe describe here an extensive striated surface\n\nformed on top of a diamictite probably represent-\n\ning a subglacial (lodgement) tillite at the basal part\n\nof the Itarar\u00e9 Subgroup (late Paleozoic), well ex-\n\nposed near S\u00e3o Luiz do Purun\u00e3, State of Paran\u00e1, on\n\nthe southern flank of the Ponta Grossa arch (Paran\u00e1\n\nBasin). The locality was first briefly reported by\n\nAssine and Zanotto (1993). Additional field work\n\nin the area (Vesely and Assine 1999, Trosdtorf Jr.\n\net al. 2003) showed that at least two other strati-\n\ngraphically distinct, closely spaced (dm) surfaces\n\nare partially exposed within the tillite. We interpret\n\nthe features as of subglacial origin that is, generated\n\nby the repetitive sliding of a glacier on unlithified\n\nsediment.\n\nOur survey of the literature showed that re-\n\nports on multiple, soft sediment glacially striated\n\nsurfaces similar to the ones here described are rel-\n\natively rare in pre-Pleistocene glacigenic succes-\n\nsions. O\u2019Brien and Christie-Blick (1992), for ex-\n\nample, described a series of six stratigraphically re-\n\npeated, closely spaced (dm to m) striated surfaces\n\nformed on glacial marine sandstone. The authors\n\ninterpret that the striae were cut by the recurrently\n\ngrounding glacier on glacial marine outwash. They\n\nassigned the features to a subglacial rather than to a\n\nfloating ice origin in view of high consistency of ori-\n\nentations of striae on the different surfaces. Several\n\nintraformational, striated surfaces occurring on top\n\nof diamictite and sandstone of the Buckeye Forma-\n\ntion in the Transantarctic Mountains of Antarctica\n\nwere reported by Aitchison et al. (1988). Most of\n\nthe surfaces are stratigraphically tens to hundreds\n\nof meters apart from each other and are typically\n\noverlain by boulder pavements. Only two surfaces\n\nat the top of the unit are as closely spaced (about\n\n20 cm) as the ones reported here. The striations\n\nwere interpreted as due to glacial erosion by Aitchi-\n\nson et al. (1988), but an origin through scouring of\n\nsoft sediment by floating ice has been proposed by\n\nWoodworth-Lynas and Dowdeswell (1994).\n\nOther reports are by Rocha-Campos et al.\n\n(1997, 1999), who described multiple, soft sedi-\n\nment, furrowed and striated surfaces on top of shal-\n\nlow marine Proterozoic quartzite, directly overlain\n\nby diamictite of the Jequitai Formation in central\n\nMinas Gerais State, and on sandstone of the Curitu-\n\nba Formation, Northeastern Brazil, and by Trosdtorf\n\nJr. et al. (2003), who described multiple striated sur-\n\nfaces on late Paleozoic fluvioglacial and glacimarine\n\nsandstones of the Itarar\u00e9 Subgroup (Paran\u00e1 Basin,\n\nSouthern Brazil). Close parallelism of the features\n\nand absence of lateral berms (Woodworth-Lynas and\n\nDowdeswell 1994) in both localities, plus deforma-\n\ntion of beds underlying the striations in the Paran\u00e1\n\nBasin suggest a subglacial origin for the striations\n\nunder an oscillating grounded, glacier margin. In\n\nNortheastern Brazil features assigned to scouring by\n\nfloating ice appear associated with subglacial stria-\n\ntions (Rocha-Campos et al. 1997, 1999).\n\nCharacteristics that distinguish the surfaces at\n\nS\u00e3o Luiz do Purun\u00e3 from other pre-Pleistocene lo-\n\ncalities are their occurrence on closely spaced beds\n\nof lodgement tillite which have similar textures and\n\nclast composition. These aspects may be related\n\nwith glacier dynamics as discussed later.\n\nTo our knowledge, multiple, glacially striated\n\nsurfaces have yet not been found in Pleistocene\n\nor Recent glacial deposits. The only example of an\n\nexceptionally well-preserved single sand bed bear-\n\ning striae and depositional features formed beneath\n\na sliding glacier is described by Clark and Hansel\n\n(1989) from the Pleistocene of Illinois. They assign\n\nthe preservation of the sand bed to syn-sedimentary\n\n(subglacial) carbonate cementation. Intraforma-\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2005) 77 (2)\n\n\n\nGLACIALLY STRIATED, SOFT SEDIMENT SURFACES 369\n\ntional, glacially striated surfaces thus do occur in\n\nrecent and Pleistocene deposits, but, as a rule, they\n\ndo not become easily exposed, and are mostly de-\n\nstroyed by erosion. Striated and furrowed surfaces\n\ndescribed may be equivalent to sharp, planar discon-\n\ntinuities (unconformities) separating multiple, thin\n\ntill units described by Eyles et al. (1982) and related\n\nto variation in deposition of lodgement till.\n\nThe intrabasinal nature of most of the ancient\n\nglacigenic deposits, on the other hand, implies con-\n\ntinuous subsidence, and accumulation of younger\n\nsediments that may include post-glacial trans-\n\ngressive beds, followed by diagenesis. Subglacially\n\ncompacted, striated beds are also often imper-\n\nmeable and subject to cementation and hardening\n\nduring weathering (Eyles 1993). Several authors\n\n(Savage 1972, Visser and Hall 1984, von Brunn\n\nand Marshall 1989, Visser 1990) have raised the\n\nquestion of the potential preservation of soft sedi-\n\nment, striated and grooved surfaces in late Paleo-\n\nzoic glacigenic successions in the context of an ac-\n\ntive glacial environment. This aspect will be briefly\n\nconsidered later in this paper.\n\nIn view of their rarity in the geological record,\n\nexposures of multiple, glacially striated, soft sedi-\n\nment surfaces offer an insight into subglacial ero-\n\nsional and depositional processes and the behavior\n\nof former glaciers. They provide observations of\n\ninteractions of glaciers and unlithified (deformable)\n\nsubstrata that may have occurred under the Gond-\n\nwana ice sheets.\n\nLITHOSTRATIGRAPHY AND\nPALEOENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS\n\nThe striated surfaces crop out in an ample, horizontal\n\narea, a few meters southwest of the road BR-277, at\n\nkm 136, east from S\u00e3o Luiz do Purun\u00e3, PR, on the\n\nsouth flank of the Ponta Grossa arch, Paran\u00e1 Basin\n\n(Fig. 1).\n\nThe Fig. 2 is a schematic stratigraphic section\n\nof the outcrop area. The main striated surface oc-\n\ncurs on the top of a 5 m thick, upper, tabular, di-\n\namictite bed. Two other partially exposed striated\n\nsurfaces occur at two different levels, decimeters\n\napart, within the diamictite. The total area of the\n\nlatter two is unknown. Except for these discontinu-\n\nities, the diamictite seems homogeneous along its\n\nentire thickness.\n\nStrata underlying the diamictite consist of a 10-\n\n15 m thick sequence of interbedded, decimetric lay-\n\ners of fine, massive sandstone and diamictite. Clasts\n\n(up to 15 cm in diameter) dispersed in the sandstone\n\nmay correspond to dropstones. The upper contact\n\nof these beds with the diamictite was not observed.\n\nThe Itarar\u00e9 succession rests unconformably on sand-\n\nstone of the Furnas Formation (Devonian).\n\nBigarella et al. (1967) assigned extensive\n\nglacial striations found on the Devonian Furnas For-\n\nmation, and on thin (decimeters to few meters) red-\n\ndish diamictite and sandstone beds that overly the\n\nFurnas, in the basal Itarar\u00e9 Subgroup exposed on\n\nsouthern Ponta Grossa arch, to two successive\n\n\u2018\u2018glaciations\u2019\u2019, respectively, Rio do Salto and Can-\n\ncela. The direction of movement of glacier in both\n\ncases was northward. Trosdtorf Jr. (unpublished\n\ndata) however, related the features to two succes-\n\nsive advances of the late Paleozoic Paran\u00e1 glacial\n\nlobe.\n\nThe diamictite is dark reddish, silty-clayey,\n\nwell consolidated, and crudely bedded and includes\n\nrare, thin, discontinuous partings of tightly folded\n\nand faulted, stratified, fine conglomeratic sandstone.\n\nClasts of varied composition (mainly Precambrian\n\nmetamorphic and igneous rocks), angular to well\n\nrounded, ranging in size from pebbles to boulders\n\n(up to 40 cm) are relatively abundant. Striations and\n\nfurrows affect the upper 4-10 cm of the diamictite,\n\ncorresponding to the depth of the features. Small\n\nplanar clast clusters with beveled clasts and isolated,\n\nfaceted and striated clasts occur in the lower portion\n\nof the diamictite bed. These features are described in\n\ndetail below. The above set of characteristics seems\n\ncompatible with the interpretation of the diamictite\n\nas a subglacial (lodgement) tillite.\n\nBeds above the diamictite comprise two\n\ncoarsening-thickening upward cycles, each around\n\n10 m thick, of fine to coarse sandstone and\n\ninterbedded mudstone (Figs. 2 and 3). The main\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2005) 77 (2)\n\n\n\n370 IVO TROSDTORF JR. ET AL.\n\nFig. 1 \u2013 Location of study area. SP: S\u00e3o Paulo; PR: Paran\u00e1; SC: Santa Catarina.\n\nstriated surface is directly overlain by a lower, up\n\nto 3 m thick mudstone layer. Mudstone intercala-\n\ntions become thinner toward the upper part of each\n\ncycle where amalgamated beds of sandstone pre-\n\ndominate. Sigmoidal cross-bedding, climbing rip-\n\nple cross-lamination, load and soft-sediment defor-\n\nmation are frequent in the sandstone. Dropstones\n\nseem to be absent in beds above the diamictite.\n\nPaleocurrents in the sandstone flowed in average\n\ntoward west (Fig. 2), normal to the local sense of\n\nmovement of glacier. We interpret this part of the\n\nsection as made up of deltaic sands intercalate with\n\nprodeltaic muds.\n\nThe lithofacies succession in the upper part of\n\nthe section examined at S\u00e3o Luiz do Purun\u00e3 (Fig. 2)\n\nseems thus to record several episodes of subglacial\n\ndeposition of layers of lodgement tillite subse-\n\nquently furrowed and striated. These are possibly\n\nrelated to phases of slow or fast ice flow respectively\n\n(Bennett and Glasser 1997). Final retreat of the\n\nglacier was accompanied by accumulation of sub-\n\naquatic muds and progradational deltaic sands.\n\nA question that arises at the studied outcrop\n\nis whether the glacier that deposited the lodgement\n\ntillite and produced the striations moved in a glacial\n\nterrestrial environment, post-glacially flooded by a\n\nwater body, or whether it reached the margin,\n\nand entered grounded into an already existing lacus-\n\ntrine or marine basin. Occurrence of extensive stri-\n\nated pavements or surfaces in pre-Pleistocene suc-\n\ncessions has often been taken as indicative of glacial\n\nterrestrial setting (e.g. Bigarella et al. 1967, Sav-\n\nage 1972, von Brunn and Marshall 1989). Acoustic\n\nimaging of glaciated continental margins (Davies\n\net al. 1997), shows a profusion of subglacial fea-\n\ntures (lineations, drumlins, flutes, glaciotectonic),\n\nthat demonstrates that subglacial processes continue\n\nunder grounded ice. These are, however, megascale\n\nfeatures. Features of the dimensions of the ones de-\n\nscribed here are probably below the resolution of\n\nacoustic methods.\n\nThe Itarar\u00e9 Subgroup beds examined are not\n\nfossiliferous, and thus the paleoenvironment of the\n\nrocks has to be interpreted on the basis of lithofacies\n\ncharacteristics and distribution in analogous recent\n\nglacial environments.\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2005) 77 (2)\n\n\n\nGLACIALLY STRIATED, SOFT SEDIMENT SURFACES 371\n\nFig. 2 \u2013 Stratigraphic section of basal Itarar\u00e9 Subgroup beds at S\u00e3o Luiz do Purun\u00e3, PR.\n\nThe diamictite bearing the striated surfaces is\n\nintercalated between beds of probable subaquatic\n\nfacies (stratified sandstone below and laminated\n\nmudstone above) in the outcrop studied (Fig. 2).\n\nThis facies relation suggests a probable penecon-\n\ntemporaneity in the deposition of striated diamicton,\n\nmuds and sands. Other features that are considered\n\nas characteristic of gravity-driven deformation that\n\ncommonly occur associated with proglacial sub-\n\naqueous beds (Eyles 1993) are missing.\n\nGeological preservation of the extensive upper\n\nsurface would probably be more prone to occur sub-\n\naquatically. Reimnitz and Barnes (1974) comment\n\nthat floating ice scours cut in marine beds are often\n\nmodified and smoothed by bottom currents unless\n\nprotected by deposition of fine sediments.\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2005) 77 (2)\n\n\n\n372 IVO TROSDTORF JR. ET AL.\n\nFig. 3 \u2013 Deltaic sandstone and mudstone overlying the diamictite. Contact marked by white line.\n\nWe thus envisage the paleoenvironmental set-\n\nting at the present locality as corresponding to a wa-\n\nter body (lacustrine/ marine) into which the glacier\n\nadvanced grounded. In analogy with sedimentary\n\nprocesses described by Powell (1983) in glacial-\n\nstuarine environment, a combination of fast retreat\n\nof the glacier margin to a position away from the\n\nwater associated with rising sea level, and lateral\n\nchanges in the site of deposition in the basin could\n\nhave resulted in the accumulation of fine-grained\n\nsediments (mud drape) over furrowed and striated\n\ntill. Absence of dropstones in the beds above the\n\ndiamictite may indicate that the glacier had lost con-\n\ntact with the water and/or no calving of bergs was\n\nhappening or even that they were moving rapidly\n\naway (Everhoi et al. 1980, Molnia 1983). We may\n\nspeculate that progradation of the outwash delta was\n\ntriggered by post-glacial isostatic uplift of the basin\n\nmargin. Coarse glaciclastic deposits (subaqueous\n\noutwash) that could indicate ice contact however\n\nwere not found. Alternatively, deposition of the\n\ndeltaic package may represent a later event when\n\nmarine processes were dominant and glacial influ-\n\nence was minimum.\n\nLithofacies succession in the studied outcrop\n\ncan be compared to fourth/ fifth order cycles inserted\n\nin the third order sequences described in the Itarar\u00e9\n\nSubgroup and interpreted as glacio-eu-isostatically\n\ncontrolled (Canuto et al. 2001).\n\nSTRIATED SURFACES\n\nThe following description is mainly based on the\n\nuppermost and better exposed striated surface at\n\nS\u00e3o Luiz do Purun\u00e3 (Fig. 2). The lower ones are\n\nof limited exposure and presumably less extensive.\n\nThe surface crops out almost continuously over\n\nan area of at least 40 m by 30 m (1,200 m2) being\n\ncovered by striae, furrows and ridges, essentially\n\nrectilinear and parallel, oriented in average around\n\nN2? (Fig. 4A). Individual larger furrows and ridges\nmay reach at least 11 m in length. Width of fur-\n\nrows is somewhat irregular due to the textural het-\n\nerogeneity of the excavated diamicton, and range\n\nfrom centimeters to around 55 cm. Their section\n\nvaries from shallow \u2018\u2018U\u2019\u2019-shaped (wider furrows)\n\nto \u2018\u2018V\u2019\u2019-shaped (narrower furrows) with depths up\n\nto 10 cm. Ridges between furrows, decimetric (30-\n\n55 cm) up to 1.5 m wide, have also low, inverted\n\n\u2018\u2018U\u2019\u2019-shaped section with flat tops or more rounded\n\nsection (Fig. 4B).\n\nStriae and small furrows occur inside larger\n\nfurrows and on ridges. Striations may be narrow\n\nand shallow at one or both ends; some have ac-\n\ncumulated ridges or prows of sediment at one end\n\n(Figs. 4A and B). The glacial features are intersected\n\nby several differently oriented groups of parallel fur-\n\nrows, artificially excavated during road construction\n\n(Fig. 4A). The former can be easily distinguished\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2005) 77 (2)\n\n\n\nGLACIALLY STRIATED, SOFT SEDIMENT SURFACES 373\n\nFurrow\n\nFig. 4 \u2013 A) General view toward NW of the upper stratified and\n\nfurrowed surface.

Orien-\n\ntations of features on the lower surfaces differ only\n\nslightly from those on the main one, but are less well\n\npreserved.\n\nA series of other features of the striated sur-\n\nfaces confirm their soft-sediment nature and give\n\nindication on subglacial processes associated with\n\nthe generation of the striae. They are:\n\na) Slumped diamicton. Small, flap-like layers of\n\ndiamictite cover striae inside furrows. They\n\nobviously represent masses of diamicton that\n\nflowed down from adjacent ridges (Fig. 4C).\n\nb) Sediment prows. Concentric, curved ridges of\n\ndiamictite around one end of clasts suggesting\n\nthat sediment has been pushed in front of them\n\nwhen being ploughed into the underlying di-\n\namicton and finally lodged (Fig. 5A). Isolated\n\nprows may have been produced by the same\n\nmechanism, though not associated with lodge-\n\nment of the ploughing clasts. Some prows may\n\nhave been produced by ice protuberances\n\nunder the sliding glacier.\n\nc) Curved, oblique furrows. A few smaller fur-\n\nrows are curved and are oblique to the main ori-\n\nentation of features on the surface. These may\n\nbe formed by rotation and change in the trajec-\n\ntory of a moving clast or by a clast with an irreg-\n\nular keel (Clark and Hansel 1989). (Fig. 5B.)\n\nd) Linear accumulation of sediment in the shadow\n\nof clasts. One example of small, dm long fea-\n\nture found inside a curved furrow may repre-\n\nsent a type of crag and tail feature (Fig. 5B).\n\nLarger ridges of diamictite, up to 55 cm wide,\n\nabout 15 cm high and several meters long, with\n\nflat, striated tops, found on the lee side of boul-\n\nders are remindful of flutes (Fig. 4B). Similar\n\nfeatures in front of Turtman Glacier (Switzer-\n\nland) have been called miniflutes and assigned\n\nto seasonal advances of the debris-free glacier\n\non pre-deposited till by van der Meer (1997).\n\nAssociation of striations with evidence of\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2005) 77 (2)\n\n\n\n374 IVO TROSDTORF JR. ET AL.\n\nlodgement at S\u00e3o Luiz do Purun\u00e3 is more sug-\n\ngestive of an origin predominantly through the\n\nploughing action of subglacial clasts. Relative\n\nabundance of clasts in the diamictite at the out-\n\ncrop studied suggests that they were an impor-\n\ntant component in the basal debris zone of the\n\nglacier;\n\ne) Embedded clasts. Clasts transported at the base\n\nof the glacier ploughed the soft till until they\n\nbecame firmly anchored in it when frictional\n\nresistance of the sediment exceeded the drag\n\nimposed by the sliding glacier (Boulton 1979).\n\nContrasting with these, features in the lower\n\nzone of the diamictite seem to point to stiffer con-\n\nditions in the till. These are planar clusters of clasts\n\nwith beveled tops and clasts with faceted and\n\nstriated tops not associated with prows that appear\n\nimmersed in the diamictite matrix on the bottom of\n\nfurrows. We consider that truncation of resistant\n\nrocks by the glacier would only be possible if the\n\nclasts were embedded in a stiff, non-deformable bed.\n\nClusters of clasts are tightly packed and have\n\ntheir long axes trending N20?, being thus roughly\nparallel with the general orientation of furrows and\n\nstriae. They could correspond to a type of sub-\n\nglacial boulder pavement (Fig. 5C).\n\nSediments prows and linear concentrations\n\nof sediment allow the interpretation of the sense of\n\nmovement of the glacier in the area that was toward\n\nnorth, coinciding with the general trend of late Pa-\n\nleozoic ice movement in the southern flank of the\n\nPonta Grossa arch (Bigarella et al. 1967).\n\nORIGIN OF THE SURFACES\n\nFurrows and striae on the studied surface have been\n\nprobably excavated into non-lithified bed (till)\n\nmainly by subglacial plowing of the diamicton by\n\nkeels of clasts being transported at the sole of a slid-\n\ning glacier. It is possible that subglacier ice pro-\n\ntuberances also contributed to this process.

As in\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2005) 77 (2)\n\n\n\nGLACIALLY STRIATED, SOFT SEDIMENT SURFACES 375\n\nour case, striations here are associated with sedi-\n\nment prows, linear grooves and striated clasts that\n\nthe authors take as evidence of subglacial lodge-\n\nment. Clark and Hansen (1989) point out that cur-\n\nrent subglacial depositional models establish that a\n\n\u2018\u2018stiff\u2019\u2019 bed on which the englacial debris can be\n\naccreted is a necessary requirement for lodgement\n\nto occur (Boulton 1982, Eyles and Menzies 1986,\n\nEyles 1993, Bennett and Glasser 1997). They then\n\npropose in the case of the Illinois surface that soft\n\nbed condition could have been generated in\n\nresponse to strong stress concentration at the\n\nclast-bed contact.\n\nAt the Paran\u00e1 Basin locality, however, the\n\nglacier moved on top of soft silty-clayey diamicton\n\n(Fig. 2). There is no evidence of presence of rel-\n\natively thick deformed bed produced by pervasive\n\nshear stress (Boulton and Hindmarsh 1987, Alley et\n\nal. 1987). On the contrary, deformation in our case\n\nis usually associated with ploughing clasts, being\n\nrestrict to the upper 10-15 cm of the tillite and un-\n\nderlain by a more stiff, less deformable horizon of\n\nlodgement till. Rare shoestring lenses of meltout\n\nsands intercalated in the diamictite may indicate\n\npoor subglacial drainage at the glacier-bed interface,\n\nhigh pore water pressure and relatively low shear\n\nstrength of the till.\n\nSeveral authors (Beget 1986, Brown et al.\n\n1987, Fischer and Clarke 1994, Tulaczyk 1999,\n\nTulaczyk et al. 2001) have proposed that plough-\n\ning of clasts and of ice protuberances at the bot-\n\ntom of ice facilitate fast sliding of a glacier over\n\ndeformable sediments. The common occurrence of\n\nsoft sediment furrowed and striated surfaces in the\n\nlate Paleozoic glacigenic beds of Brazil suggests that\n\nice sliding by ploughing was a common mechanism\n\nfor the displacement of the Gondwana glaciers.\n\nThe small linear accumulation of sediments\n\nand flute-like ridges found on the striated surface\n\nsuggest that other erosional and depositional sub-\n\nglacial processes may also have been active at S\u00e3o\n\nLuiz do Purun\u00e3, involving the flow or deformation of\n\nsediment around obstacles formed by the presence\n\nof a boulder. The first features are also remindful\n\nof hairpin erosional marks assigned to the action of\n\nhorseshoe vortices of meltwater around an obstacle\n\n(Shaw 1998). Hairpin marks are, however, entirely\n\nabrasional features that have been reported generally\n\nassociated with subglacially hard bedrock. Surface\n\nof flute-like features bear striae indicating that they\n\nwere molded in contact with the glacier (Fig. 4B).\n\nAlthough basal meltwater did probably existed at\n\nthe interface between the glacier and the unconsoli-\n\ndated bed, landforms indicative of strong meltwater\n\naction, such as sinuous mega-channels, are missing.\n\nInterpretation of the local succession (Fig. 2)\n\nin terms of glacial stratigraphy presents some dif-\n\nficulties and a provisional explanation is here ad-\n\nvanced. The apparent rheology of the diamictite, as\n\ndiscussed above, suggests that each bed of lodge-\n\nment tillite overlain by the furrowed and striated\n\nsurfaces may record transitional episodes of de-\n\nposition of subglacial till followed by erosion by\n\nploughing. These could correspond respectively to\n\na change from conditions of slow to fast moving ice\n\n(Bennett and Glasser 1997). The tillite beds are of\n\nthe same facies both texturally as well as in clast\n\ncomposition and have been deposited by a glacier\n\nflowing consistently toward north.\n\nIn our view, the above circumstances may be\n\nmore easily explained if we consider the studied\n\ntillite sequence as resulting from a single glacial\n\nphase or advance, during which changes in the\n\nglacier flow or dynamics took place leading to alter-\n\nnation between subglacial deposition and erosion.\n\nThe concept is analogous to the model of lodge-\n\nment till complex proposed by Eyles et al. (1982)\n\nfor Pleistocene lodgement till sequences (lodgement\n\ntill complexes) of England. Accordingly, the in-\n\ntraformational striated surfaces at S\u00e3o Luiz do Pu-\n\nrun\u00e3 would be equivalent to the sharp planar discon-\n\ntinuities (unconformities) that separate Pleistocene\n\nlodgement till units.\n\nIn this context, preservation of the soft sedi-\n\nment striated surfaces that occur internally in the di-\n\namictite at S\u00e3o Luiz do Purun\u00e3 may be explained by\n\nthe deposition of a layer of diamicton on top of each\n\nof them. Covering by subaqueous mud would, by\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2005) 77 (2)\n\n\n\n376 IVO TROSDTORF JR. ET AL.\n\nits turn, protect the uppermost surface from subse-\n\nquent erosion. A similar explanation was advanced\n\nby Trosdtorf Jr. et al. (2001) for the preservation of\n\nother multiple, soft sediment, striated surfaces from\n\nthe base of the Itarar\u00e9 Subgroup, in Palmeira, some\n\n30 km west from the present locality.\n\nFINAL REMARKS\n\nClosely spaced, stratigraphically repeated striated\n\nand furrowed surfaces formed on top of late Pale-\n\nozoic (Itarar\u00e9 Subgroup) beds of lodgement tillite,\n\nwell exposed in northern Paran\u00e1 Basin, Brazil, al-\n\nlow examination of subglacial erosional and deposi-\n\ntional features indicative of processes that occurred\n\nin the interface between the Gondwana glacier flow-\n\ning on soft, deformable bed. The multiple striated\n\nsurfaces were generated mostly by ploughing of un-\n\nlithified diamicton by clasts transported at the base\n\nof a warm based glacier on top of lodgement till\n\nbeds. The relative fine-grained diamicton and pres-\n\nence of meltwater probably provided a weak inter-\n\nface between the bed and overlying glacier leading\n\nto limited deformation and possibly fast sliding.\n\nThe local tillite stratigraphy records a history\n\nof an advance of a grounded glacier into a water-\n\nfilled basin. Variation in the velocity of glacier flow\n\nfrom slow to fast was associated with deposition\n\nof lower layer of lodgement till and erosion of an\n\nupper soft bed and formation of striated surfaces.\n\nThe proposed explanation is analogous to the model\n\nof lodgement till complex discussed by Eyles et al.\n\n(1982). Retreat of the glacier was probably fast,\n\nfollowed by accumulation of muds on top of till.\n\nPost-glacial history is marked by the progradation\n\nof wedge bodies of deltaic sands into the lacustrine\n\nor marine basin.\n\nSubglacial features associated to multiple stri-\n\nated surfaces preserved in studied locality are rarely\n\nseen in the geological record and offer a view of pro-\n\ncesses associated with a warm based glacier moving\n\non a soft and deformable bed, such as plough-\n\ning. We believe these features in the pre-Pleistocene\n\nrecord deserve additional study.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank Ian McReath for kindly revising the En-\n\nglish language.
