Neste \ntrabalho pretende-se estudar as altera\u00e7\u00f5es das mar\u00e9s induzidas por \nmodifica\u00e7\u00f5es geomorfol\u00f3gicas entre 1987/88 a 2017, verificando as \naltera\u00e7\u00f5es na amplitude e fase dos constituintes de mar\u00e9: ?2, ?2,  ?4 , ?6  \ne ???, durante esse intervalo de tempo.

Os dados utilizados neste \ntrabalho foram recolhidos por mar\u00e9grafos localizados nos principais canais \nda laguna. Foram elaborados gr\u00e1ficos de varia\u00e7\u00e3o anual da amplitude e da \nfase dos constituintes de mar\u00e9: ?2, ?2,  ?4 , ?6  e ??? (determinados por \nan\u00e1lise harm\u00f3nica usando a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o T-Tide do Matlab), para estudar a \nsua evolu\u00e7\u00e3o entre 1987/88 e 2017, permitindo assim, verificar a \nexist\u00eancia de altera\u00e7\u00f5es relevantes ao longo do tempo.  S\u00e9ries anuais da \nmar\u00e9 meteorol\u00f3gica foram determinadas para cada ano entre o per\u00edodo \nde 2012 a 2017, subtraindo ao n\u00edvel da \u00e1gua medido nos mar\u00e9grafos a \nprevis\u00e3o da mar\u00e9 astron\u00f3mica, para se fazer o estudo da distribui\u00e7\u00e3o das \nanomalias positivas e negativas em cada esta\u00e7\u00e3o estudada, e \ncompreendendo a rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre as vari\u00e1veis meteorol\u00f3gicas e a forma\u00e7\u00e3o \nda sobre-eleva\u00e7\u00e3o das mar\u00e9s. Com esta finalidade, foram elaborados \ngr\u00e1ficos da press\u00e3o atmosf\u00e9rica, intensidade e dire\u00e7\u00e3o do vento, \nprecipita\u00e7\u00e3o, o n\u00edvel da \u00e1gua medido e com as residuais. A partir dos \nresultados obtidos, verifica-se que, para cada esta\u00e7\u00e3o, de uma forma geral, \nos valores anuais de amplitude dos constituintes estudados, est\u00e3o a \naumentar enquanto a fase est\u00e1 a diminuir. Entre 1987/88 e 2002/03 houve \num aumento de amplitude nas esta\u00e7\u00f5es estudadas, sendo esta mudan\u00e7a \numa consequ\u00eancia do aumento da profundidade dos canais de navega\u00e7\u00e3o \ndevido \u00e0s opera\u00e7\u00f5es de dragagem realizadas em 1998. De 2012 a 2017, e \nap\u00f3s o aumento do molhe Norte, os valores anuais permitem concluir que \nn\u00e3o h\u00e1 varia\u00e7\u00f5es significativas na amplitude ou fase. Assim, o aumento do \nmolhe Norte n\u00e3o produziu mudan\u00e7as significativas na din\u00e2mica da mar\u00e9 \nna Ria de Aveiro. Atrav\u00e9s da an\u00e1lise da mar\u00e9 meteorol\u00f3gica, verificou-se \nque as anomalias positivas s\u00e3o mais frequentes do que anomalias \nnegativas. Dos diferentes eventos ocorridos entre 2012 e 2017, apenas \ndois influenciaram toda a laguna, tendo sido determinados pelas \ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es meteorol\u00f3gicas adversas verificadas a n\u00edvel nacional. Os \nrestantes apenas ocorreram localmente. Os eventos de anomalias \nnegativas ocorreram em menor n\u00famero. Verificou-se ainda, que os valores \nmais altos do n\u00edvel da \u00e1gua do mar registados n\u00e3o resultaram da exist\u00eancia \nde mar\u00e9s meteorol\u00f3gicas, mas foram devidos \u00e0s mar\u00e9s vivas. Portanto, a \nocorr\u00eancia conjunta de mar\u00e9s vivas e condi\u00e7\u00f5es meteorol\u00f3gicas extremas \nser\u00e1 um risco para as zonas envolventes \u00e0 laguna, j\u00e1 que poder\u00e3o ficar \nsujeitas a inunda\u00e7\u00f5es. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords Harmonic Analysis, Tidal Propagation, Astronomical Tide, Metereological \n\nTide, Ria de Aveiro. \n\nAbstract \n\n \n\nRia de Aveiro is a shallow lagoon, located in the Northwest of \nPortugal, separated from the sea by a barrier island, with which is connected \nthrough an artificial channel fixed by breakwaters. This work aims to study \nthe tidal changes induce by geomorphologic modifications occurred in Ria \nde Aveiro between 1987/88 and 2017, analysing the variations on the tidal \namplitude and phase of tidal constituents: ?2 , ?2,  ?4 , ?6  and ???. This \nwork also aims to determine the frequency of storm surge phenomena \noccurrence, between 2012 and 2017, determining which factors influence \nthe generation of the storm - variation in atmospheric pressure, intensity \nand direction of the wind and precipitation - and verify the increase of the \nwater level in Ria de Aveiro caused by these meteorological events. Data \nwere collected on tidal gauges in the main channels of the lagoon. Annual \namplitude and phase variation graphics of tidal constituents: ?2 , ?2,  ?4 , \n?6  and ??? (which were computed using the T-Tide Matlab package), were \ndrawn for the different years. This allowed to observe the annual tidal \nevolution and to verify if there had been any relevant changes during the \ntime interval in which the data collection took place.  Annual series of the \nresidual meteorological tide were determined for each year between 2012 \nand 2017, by subtracting the astronomical predicted tides from the \nmeasured tidal signal, and to identify the distribution of the positive and \nnegative anomalies in each station studied, and find the relationship \nbetween meteorological variables and the generation of tidal elevations. \nFor this purpose, were drawn graphs of the atmospheric pressure, wind \nintensity and direction, precipitation and water level and residual graphs. \nFrom the results obtained, in general and for each station, the annual \namplitude values are increasing while the phase is decreasing. Between \n1987/88 and 2002/03 there was an increase in amplitude in the studied \nstations. This change is a consequence of the increase in the depth of the \nnavigation channels due to dredging operations in 1998. From 2012 to 2017 \nand after the North breakwater extension there are no significant variations \nin tidal amplitude or phase. Thus, the extension of the North breakwater did \nnot produce appreciable changes in the tidal dynamics in Ria de Aveiro. By \nthe analysis of the meteorological tide was verified that positive anomalies \nare more frequent than negative. From the different events occurring \nbetween 2012 and 2017, only two positive storm surges influenced the \nentire lagoon, having been generated by adverse meteorological conditions \nverified at national level. The remaining were manifested only locally. The \nevents with negative anomalies occurred in a smaller number. From the \nanalysis of all the studied events, it was verified that the higher values of the \nlevel of the sea water did not result from the existence of meteorological \ntides, but from the spring tides. Therefore, the joining of a positive storm \nevent at high tide of spring tides will constitute a high risk for the marginal \nareas of the lagoon, which may be flooded. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\ni \n\n \n\nContents \nList of Figures .................................................................................................................................................. iii \n\nList of Tables .................................................................................................................................................... v \n\n1.

Introduction \n \n\n1.1. Motivation and Aims \n \n\nCoastal areas are subject to great natural and anthropogenic pressures. Due to their \n\nphysical characteristics, these areas provide exceptional conditions for biological productivity, as \n\nwell as industry, commercial and urban development. Ria de Aveiro is an example of this, a very \n\nimportant area on the Portuguese coast that provides natural conditions for harbour, navigation, \n\nindustry and recreational facilities, but also offers good conditions for agriculture and aquaculture. \n\nBecause of these exceptional conditions, it is a densely populated place that intensifies \n\nanthropogenic pressures. \n\nRia de Aveiro is highly influenced by marine and fluvial interaction (Plecha et al, 2014), being \n\na dynamic system strongly dependent on tidal action. The lagoon has been subject to several \n\nchanges, not only caused by nature, which include the effects of storms, winds, tides and sea level \n\nrise, on the local erosion and deposition, but also by anthropogenic factors, which are generally \n\nrelated to fishing, agriculture, tourism and coastal works (Vaz and Dias, 2011). Over the last years \n\nits geomorphology has undergone changes that will specifically affect their tidal characteristics, \n\nmaking these systems more vulnerable to risks of flooding and increasing the salinization of the \n\nadjacent land, as well as hindering the navigation in the shallow channels. The propagation of tides \n\nin coastal environments, heavily depends on their morphological configuration (Dias and Picado, \n\n2011), so a constant motorization of these natural systems is necessary in order to predict the \n\nconsequences caused in their hydrodynamics and thus to intervene with some anticipation, since \n\nthese natural systems are of such socioeconomic importance.  \n\nThe extreme meteorological factors are also important in the dynamics of the estuary, as \n\nthese will affect the meteorological tide, which is directly related to atmospheric pressure, wind \n\nand precipitation, having an impact in the water level elevation, particularly in shallow areas such \n\nas Ria de Aveiro. At times, these conditions interact in a complex way to increase or decrease the \n\nwater levels significantly above or under predicted tide heights. Storm surges generated through \n\nthese meteorological conditions induce great navigational and other hazards, such as the flooding \n\nof adjacent land (Ribbat, 2012). Another factor that can cause flooding is the long periods of strong \n\nwinds, which can induce water accumulation on one side of the channels. \n\nThis thesis intends to study the tidal changes induced by geomorphologic modifications \n\nbetween 1987/88 and 2017, using the analysis of tidal constituents: ?2  (semi-diurnal lunar tide), \n\n?2(solar-semi diurnal tide),  ?4  (quadric-diurnal tide), ?6 (hexa-diurnal tide) and ??? (long period \n\ntide) in several channels of Ria de Aveiro.  \n\nThis thesis also aims to determine the frequency of storm surge phenomena occurrence, \n\nbetween 2012 and 2017, determining which factors most influence the generation of the storm - \n\nvariation in atmospheric pressure, intensity and direction of the wind and precipitation - and to \n\nverify the increase in water level in Ria de Aveiro caused by these meteorological events. \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\n1.2. Work Structure \n \n\nThis MSc thesis includes six Chapters. \n\nChapter 1 presents the motivation and aims, the structure of this work and the state of the art \n\nabout the problem that is researched. \n\n Theoretical concepts about astronomical and meteorological tides is described in Chapter 2. \n\nIn Chapter 3 are described the main characteristics and location of Ria de Aveiro.  \n\nThe description of the methodology followed in this work is presented in Chapter 4, including \n\nthe details about the water level and the meteorological data, and also the data processing analyses \n\n(tidal harmonic and non-tidal components). \n\nChapter 5 includes the results and the discussion concerning the tidal components analysed in \n\nthis work \u2013 tidal harmonic analysis and meteorological residual analysis. \n\nFinally, the main conclusions are presented in Chapter 6. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.3. State of the Art \n \n\nCoastal systems are natural environments of extreme importance, not only because of their \n\nbiological richness, but also because they are places with optimal conditions to accommodate \n\ninfrastructures of various sectors, namely agricultural, port, industrial and recreational, among \n\nothers. Consequently, these coastal systems are constantly suffering with pressures of natural and \n\nanthropogenic origin. \n\nThe understanding of the evolution of the lagoon systems at several levels, as biological, \n\nchemical, physical and others, led the scientific community to carry out several studies that later \n\nresulted in several publications. Ria de Aveiro is an example of this, as can be verified by the large \n\nnumber of works on physical processes that have been published over the years, mainly resulting \n\nfrom numerical modelling simulations. \n\nOne of the first studies carried out on hydrological characterization of Ria de Aveiro was \n\ndone by Dias et al (1999), where authors concluded that the astronomical tide is the main forcing \n\nagent driving water circulation in the lagoon. The tide is semidiurnal and the tidal wave propagation \n\nin the lagoon has the characteristics of a damped progressive wave. The lunar principal, ?2 , and \n\nthe solar principal, ?2, are the main tidal constituents. These authors also showed that Ria de Aveiro \n\ncan be considered as vertically homogeneous, except occasionally when fresh water inflows are \n\nhigh, and the upper parts of the lagoon can present vertical stratification.  \n\nProperties of tide and tidal currents in Ria de Aveiro are characterized and discussed by Dias \n\net al (2000). These authors showed that tide propagates from the inlet are present in the entire \n\nlagoon. There is a tidal distortion inside the lagoon and during the propagation the tidal wave \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\namplitude decrease and the phase lag increases, results also found by Ara\u00fajo (2005), the author \n\ncompared amplitudes and phases values between 1987/88 and 2002/03. This author also \n\ndetermined that until 1987/88 most of the lagoon was flood-dominant, and since then the central \n\nsection of Ria de Aveiro has become ebb-dominant, while the northern and southern sections \n\nremain flood-dominant. Dias (2011) pointed out that the deepening of the inlet channel and \n\nsurrounding area is one of the main causes for the changes in the characteristics of the tide that \n\nhave been reported by several works about this topic (Dias et al. (1999), Dias et al (2009) and Ara\u00fajo \n\n(2005)). \n\nTo evaluate the effects on the Ria de Aveiro hydrodynamics due to changes in several \n\nnatural and anthropogenic factors over the last years, other studies have been carried out. Dias and \n\nPicado (2011) studied the tidal dynamics changes induced by morphologic anthropogenic and \n\nnatural modifications in channels depth and geometry of Ria de Aveiro. Their results of the model \n\nused, suggest that the amplitude of the tidal constituents ?2  and ?1 has increased and its phase \n\nhas decreased in response to the increased depth of the inlet channel. When an enlargement of \n\nthe flooded area is assumed, a slight decrease in tidal amplitude and an increase in phase lag are \n\nobserved. The tidal prism at the lagoon mouth has increased from the past to the present and the \n\nenlargement of the flooded area also increased the tidal prism.  Similar conclusions were presented \n\nby Picado et al (2011) in relation to the increase of the flooded area. In this work, the authors also \n\nevaluated the consequences of the mean sea-water rise in the hydrodynamics of the Ria de Aveiro. \n\nThis results in the amplitude increase and a phase decrease, as well as increasing flood and ebb \n\ncurrents and in the dominance of ebb (flood) in the central zone (upstream). Lopes et al (2013) also \n\nstudied the changes induced by local morphological modifications in flooding extension, as well as \n\nin the tidal prism, between 1987 and 2012. These authors concluded that the lagoon deepening \n\nobserved led to a generalized increase in the extension of the lagoon flooded area as well as in the \n\ntidal prism, making the lagoon more vulnerable to oscillations. \n\nRecently, Dias (2016a) presented results of investigations carried out mainly using \n\nnumerical modelling techniques. The main objective was to characterise and study the temporal \n\nevolution of the tide in the Ria de Aveiro, between 1987/88 and 2012, in the context of the \n\ngeomorphological evolution of the lagoon. During this time, a significant amplification of the tidal \n\namplitude and its faster propagation along the lagoon main channels was identified. It was \n\nconcluded that the properties of the tide in the Ria de Aveiro near the inlet are strongly dependent \n\non the characteristics of the oceanic tide. Therefore, smaller differences are identified in the central \n\narea of the lagoon, which are larger in the head of the main channels. It was also verified that the \n\nevolution of the tide in the Ria de Aveiro is extremely influenced by the induced geomorphologic \n\nchanges, both of natural and anthropogenic origin. This results in the increase of the tidal amplitude \n\nand in the decrease of the phase verified in the last decades, which are in part a consequence of \n\nthe deepening of the inlet channel and the main channels of the lagoon. Another variable studied \n\nwas the increase in the floodable area of the lagoon, that indirectly leads to an increase in the inlet \n\nchannel depth. This responds to the intensification of dominant ebb currents in this zone, which in \n\nthe future may lead to an increase in the tidal amplitude.  \n\nThe morphological evolution of the Ria de Aveiro inlet was analysed by Plecha et al (2011), \n\nsince 1987/88, three years after the conclusion of the works for the configuration of the \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nbreakwaters, to 2005. It was found that the inlet channel deepening was motivated by the new \n\ninlet configuration, which changed the sediment dynamics and the region that surrounds the North \n\njetty, putting at risk the stability of this structure. The residual sedimentary fluxes at the entrance \n\nchannel are mostly directed offshores and significantly lower than observed at the nearshore area, \n\nevidencing the lagoon capacity to export sediments. Also, the impact of the extension on the inlet \n\nbreakwaters (200 meters in 2012) on the hydrodynamics of Ria de Aveiro was studied by Dias and \n\nMariano (2011) through a numerical modelling approach. This work shows that the jetty extension \n\nslightly changes the local hydrodynamic patterns, and may induce modifications in the overall \n\nlagoon circulation related with the tidal prism decrease found for the main channels. \n\nCoastal hazards, such as inundation and coastal erosion, caused by natural or \n\nanthropogenic factors, have been widely studied all over the world due to their harmful \n\nconsequences. The main natural cause of coastal hazards arises from weather extremes, such as \n\nstorm surges and the cycles in ocean-atmospheric response (see level and currents). The \n\ndependence of this phenomenon on the wind and on the variation of the atmospheric pressure was \n\nmade by Pore (1963), who studied the relation of these two meteorological factors with the \n\nextratropical storm surges in Atlantic City. It was also defined by this author that meteorological \n\ntide (storm surge) is the algebraic difference between the observed and the predicted tides, which \n\nis considered to be the meteorological effect on sea level. \n\nRibbat (2012) also related the effect of wind and atmospheric pressure on the formation of \n\nstorm surges in Torres Strait, Australia. This author found that the response of residual sea level to \n\nbarometric pressure is most significant during periods of low pressure systems, but in relation to \n\nthe wind these phenomena depends on the wind speed, direction and duration. This work also \n\nconcluded that the wind would be least influential in these events. \n\nOverelevation of the tide due to meteorological effects has also been subject of studies in \n\nPortugal, since it is an important factor for the occurrence of floods, namely in Ria de Aveiro. Tidal \n\nexchanges are continuous and predictable as they are periodic. However, subtidal process are less \n\npredictable as they are generated by meteorological forcing. \n\nProcesses affecting the exchanges between lagoons and the adjacent inner continental \n\nshelf are controlled by tidal and subtidal oscillations. Dias and Fernandes (2006) studied the \n\npropagation of tidal and subtidal oscillation throughout the access channel of Patos Lagoon (Brazil) \n\nand the main channels of Ria de Aveiro Lagoon. For Ria de Aveiro, the tidal energy is stronger than \n\nthe subtidal energy, propagating into the far end of channels. The semidiurnal and diurnal tidal \n\nsignals are similarly attenuated, whereas the quarter-diurnal signal is essentially generated inside \n\nthe lagoon. The subtidal energy is usually very low, however the energy is amplified along the \n\nlagoon channels when associated with sporadic extreme weather events connected with coastal \n\nsea-level changes or high river discharge. \n\nTaborda and Dias (1992) analysed storm surge during two storms in February/March 1978, \n\nand in December 1981, on the Portuguese coast. They characterised these storms using tide gauge \n\ndata (Viana do Castelo, Leix\u00f5es, Aveiro, Cascais, Lisboa, Tr\u00f3ia, Sines and Lagos) and predicted \n\nastronomical tide to calculate the meteorological tide, founding a relationship between the surge \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nlevels with the atmospheric pressure variations and the wind speed and suggest that the surge \n\nlevels were mostly related with the local meteorological conditions. \n\nThe work developed by Picado et al (2013) had as principal aim to evaluate the storm surges \n\namplitude impact in the hydrodynamics of Ria de Aveiro lagoon, through numerical modelling \n\nsimulations. These authors concluded that the most significant changes occur at the main channels \n\nhead for all return periods analysed (2, 10 and 100 years), revealing that these regions are the most \n\nvulnerable to marginal flooding. Also, storm surges induced higher velocities and tidal prism in the \n\nlagoon, increasing the marginal erosion risk, as well as the salinization of the lagoon marginal lands.  \n\nCoastal wave regime is also important, mainly in lagoons such as the Ria de Aveiro, because \n\nthey are exposed to a highly energetic wave climate. Vaz et al (2013) studied the influence of the \n\ncoastal wave regime at the inlet channel dynamics and concluded that although the dominant \n\nforcing of Ria de Aveiro inlet hydrodynamics is the tide, the sea level and current velocity \n\nfluctuations depend also on the wave regime. Consequently, the storm events induce important \n\nwaves set-up that may change the inlet hydrodynamics. \n\nTo study the consequences of the extreme sea levels caused by the combination of high \n\ntides, storm surges and wind-generated waves, was one of the aims of Lopes (2016) Ph.D. Thesis. \n\nThis author analysed the influence of the simultaneous occurrence of high tide and storm surges \n\non the risks of flooding, especially when these phenomena occur in neap or spring tide conditions. \n\nThis work concluded that the most intense storm surge events do not always induce extreme sea \n\nlevels, since they depend also on the tidal level. Also, were not found significant evidences that \n\nclimate changes would modify tidal and storm surge levels in the Ria de Aveiro adjacent coast. \n\n  \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\n2. Theoretical Concepts \n \n\nAs will be discussed in the following theoretical concepts, gravitational forces of the Moon, \n\nSun and Earth are the main causes of short-term sea level fluctuations throughout ocean basins, \n\nknown as tidal movements. These movements are termed astronomical tides, because of the forces \n\nalready mentioned. Other stimuli impacting sea level elevation is the meteorological forcing \n\n(atmospheric pressure, wind stress and precipitation), that in certain conditions interact in a \n\ncomplex way to elevate or reduce water levels significantly above or under predicted tidal heights, \n\nknown as storm surges. Any sequence of measurements of sea level elevation will have a tidal \n\ncomponent (astronomical tide) and a non-tidal component (meteorological tide). \n\nA review of theoretical concepts about astronomical and meteorological tides is performed \n\nin this section. \n\n \n\n2.1. Astronomical Tides \n \n\nSince the Earth rotates around its axis, the effects of the interaction between gravitational \n\npulling forces of the Moon and the Sun on Earth, and the centrifugal derived from the system \n\nrotation is responsible for the generation of the astronomical tide. The tide generated force \n\n(resulting from the interaction between the gravitational force and the centrifugal force) acts \n\ndirectly over the ocean, generating waves characterised by a long period. The movements \n\noriginated by these forces are termed as gravitational or astronomical tides. These progress to the \n\ncoast, where, due to the reduction of depth, it is possible to identify them by the regular rise and \n\nfall of the surface of the sea. This periodic vertical movement of water on the surface of the Earth \n\nis frequently known as tide. \n\nThe concept of tide can be understood as the sum of many constituents or partial tides, where \n\nthe respective periods correspond to the period of one of the astronomical movement between \n\nthe Earth, the Sun and the Moon. \n\nEach harmonic constituent can be described mathematically in terms of amplitude and period \n\nby: \n\n?(?) = ?? cos(??? ? ?? ) , (2.1) \n\nwhere ? is the value of the variable elevation at time ?, ??  is the amplitude of the oscillation, ?? is \n\nthe angular velocity which is related to the period ?? , and ??  is the phase lag relative to some \n\ndefined time zero, and ? is time. The time zero for ??  is often taken as the phase lag on the \n\nEquilibrium Tide phase at the Greenwich Meridian (Pugh, 2004). The different harmonic \n\nconstituents obtained by the harmonic analysis allows the prediction and determination of tidal \n\ncharacteristics. \n\nA tide is considered ideal if it presents two high tides and two low tides of uneven height \n\nduring a lunar day. However, such scenario does not happen in all places due to changes caused by \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\ndifferent depths, dimensions and shape of the ocean basins. Therefore, tides have different \n\ncharacteristics, namely diurnal tide, semidiurnal tide or mixed tide. \n\nTidal wave distortions are usually expressed as simple constituents with frequencies that \n\nare multiple, sums or frequency differences of fundamental harmonic constituents. \n\nIn addition to the diurnal tidal cycle, there is also a fortnight cycle due to the changing \n\nposition of the moon\u2019s relative to earth. When the moon is New or Full, the spring tides occur, with \n\nan approximate period of two times a month, and are characterized by an increase in tidal range. \n\nNeap tides, with small tidal range, occur near the time of the first and last lunar quarters, between \n\nspring tides. \n\n \n\n2.2. Meteorological Tides \n \n\nThe sea-level is characterised by having a tidal (astronomical tide) and a non-tidal component \n\n(meteorological tide). The non-tidal component is the part of the sea level that remains once the \n\nastronomical tidal component has been removed and is called the residual or meteorological \n\nresidual (Pugh, 1996). \n\nThe general representation of the observed level, ?(?) that varies with time may be written by \n\nthe following equation: \n\n?(?) = ?0(?) + ?(?) + ?(?) , (2.2) \n\n \n\nwhere ?0(?) is the mean sea level, which changes very slowly with time, ?(?) is the astronomical \n\npart of the variation and ?(?) is the meteorological surge component.  \n\nFrom Equation (2.2), the meteorological tide is the difference between the observed and \n\nthe predicted sea levels at a given time ?: \n\n \n\n?(?) = ?(?) ? ?0(?) ? ?(?) . (2.3) \n\n  \n\nThe term meteorological tide, or storm surge, is used for the excess sea levels generated \n\nby a severe storm, produced by meteorological causes (atmospheric pressure gradient and extreme \n\nnear-surface wind stress) (Pugh, 2004). These two meteorological effects, the atmospheric pressure \n\ngradient and the wind tension parallel to the surface of the sea water, are the main factors \n\nresponsible for the occurrence of over-elevation of the water. However, there are others that when \n\noccurring simultaneously with those mentioned above, may increase storm surges, such as the \n\noccurrence of spring tides, an increase of precipitation that drives to an increasing of river flow, and \n\nthe formation of waves due to wind. \n\nThe water movement can be described by hydrodynamic equations, which are defined \n\nconsidering a Cartesian coordinate system, with ? and ? axis in the horizontal plane and the ? axis \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\ndirected vertically upwards, and zero level for vertical displacements is taken as the long-term mean \n\nsea-level. The momentum equations are: \n\n \n\n??\n\n??\n? ?? = ?\n\n1\n\n?\n\n???\n\n??\n? ?\n\n?\n\n??\n(? ? ?)? +\n\n1\n\n?\n\n???\n\n??\n, (2.4) \n\n \n\n \n\n??\n\n??\n+ ?? = ?\n\n1\n\n?\n\n???\n\n??\n? ?\n\n?\n\n??\n(? ? ?)? +\n\n1\n\n?\n\n???\n\n??\n, (2.5) \n\n \n\nand the continuity equation: \n\n \n\n??\n\n??\n+\n\n??\n\n??\n+\n\n??\n\n??\n= 0, (2.6) \n\n \n\nwhere ? is the free surface elevation,  ? and ? are the horizontal velocity components, ? is the \n\nwater density, ? is the gravitational acceleration, ? is the Coriolis parameter, ?? is the atmospheric \n\npressure, ??  and ??  are the frictional terms arising from shear stress across horizontal planes and  \n\n? ?is the tide-generating potential. \n\nBy integrating through a vertical water column from the bottom ? = ?? to the surface     \n\n? = ? and defining the components ?, ? of the volume transported by the following two equations: \n\n \n\n? = ? ? ??\n?\n\n??\n, (2.7) \n\n \n\n? = ? ? ??\n?\n\n??\n. (2.8) \n\n \n\nThe depth-integrated equations may be obtained as: \n\n \n\n??\n\n??\n+\n\n?\n\n??\n(\n\n?2\n\n?+?\n) +\n\n?\n\n??\n(\n\n??\n\n?+?\n) ? ?? = ?\n\n(?+?)\n\n?\n\n???\n\n??\n? ?(? + ?)\n\n?\n\n??\n(? ? ?)? +\n\n??? ????\n\n?\n, (2.9) \n\n \n\n??\n\n??\n+\n\n?\n\n??\n(\n\n??\n\n?+?\n) +\n\n?\n\n??\n(\n\n?2\n\n?+?\n) + ?? = ?\n\n(?+?)\n\n?\n\n???\n\n??\n? ?(? + ?)\n\n?\n\n??\n(? ? ?)? +\n\n??? ????\n\n?\n , (2.10) \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nand  \n\n \n\n??\n\n??\n+\n\n??\n\n??\n+\n\n??\n\n??\n= 0. (2.11) \n\n \n\nThe velocity components ? and ?, and the transport components ? and ? refer to the tidal \n\nconstituents and the meteorological effects. In coastal waters of limited extent, the direct effects \n\nof the tide-generating potential, represented by ?,? can be neglected. The components ???  and ???  \n\nare the tangential shearing stress of the wind on the sea surface. ??? and ???  represent the \n\ncomponents of stress at the bottom (Bowden, 1984). \n\nAs already mentioned, the effect of atmospheric pressure and wind are the main factors \n\nfor the occurrence of a storm surge. Therefore, it is necessary to analyse separately how sea water \n\nbehaves with the variations of these two factors: atmospheric pressure and wind stress.  \n\n \n\n2.2.1. Atmospheric Pressure Effect - Inverted Barometer Effect \n \n\nChanges in atmospheric pressure may increase or reduce the sea level height, depending \n\non the type of prevailing system. As a result of the inverted barometric effect, low pressure systems \n\nelevate sea levels, while high pressure systems tend to depress them (Ribbat, 2012). The physical \n\nbehaviour of this barometric effect can be explained considering equation (2.9), neglecting the \n\neffect related to the term ??? ? ??? , assuming that V = 0 (considering the sides of the channel \n\nparallel to the ? axis), and consider the variation of ? throughout the channel is smaller compared \n\nto its length. The equation obtained is: \n\n \n\n??\n\n??\n= ?\n\n1\n\n??\n\n???\n\n??\n . (2.12) \n\n \n\nIf the variations ?? (sea level variations) and ??? (local variations of atmospheric pressure) \n\nare related to a finite and horizontal displacement ??, then equation 2.12 becomes: \n\n \n\n?? = ?\n1\n\n??\n???  , (2.13) \n\n \n\nin which the decrease in atmospheric pressure is followed by an increase in sea level height, and \n\nvice versa (Bowden, 1984). \n\nAn increase in atmospheric pressure of one millibar will produce a theoretical decrease in \n\nsea water of one centimetre (Pugh, 2004). \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\n2.2.2. Wind Stress Effect \n \n\nWhen a storm approaches the coast, the alongshore component of wind stress drives an \n\nEkman setup (the net transport of water by the wind occurs at a 90\u00b0 angle to the right of the wind \n\nvector in the Northern hemisphere) at the coast located to the right-side of the wind. As an \n\nimportant consequence, the coastal region located to the right-side of the storm track usually \n\nsuffers larger storm surge and damages than the coastal region located to the left side (Bertin, \n\n2016). \n\nConsidering the accumulation of sea water on the Portuguese coast, the entrance of \n\nseawater into Ria de Aveiro can increase significantly in response to Ekman transport, induced by \n\nsouthward winds. Since the tidal wave in the lagoon is forced by the oceanic tide, an increase in \n\nwater level inside the lagoon is observed. \n\nThe surface currents generated by the wind stress behave differently depending on the \n\ndepth of the site being studied. For a wind blowing along a narrow channel of constant depth, the \n\nsteady-state effect of wind drag on the slope of the sea surface is to pile up water up at the \n\ndownwind end and to produce higher sea levels there. This can result from a balance between the \n\nwind stress and the pressure gradient that opposes it (Pugh, 2004). \n\nConsidering a closed channel at one of its ends, and that the bottom stress is near zero and \n\nconsidering a small ? compared to the height of the water column ?, equation (2.9) can be reduced \n\nto: \n\n \n\n??\n\n??\n=\n\n???\n\n???\n , (2.14) \n\n \n\nWhere \n??   \n\n??\n is the slope formed in the sea water due to wind, and ???  the effective tangencial stress \n\nof the wind on the sea surface (Bowden, 1984). The equation of ???  is: \n\n \n\n??? = ?? ?? ?\n2  , (2.15) \n\n \n\nwhere ? is the wind speed measured at a given height, usually taken 10 m above the sea surface, \n\n??  is the density of the air and ??  is a dimensionless drag coefficient (Bowden, 1984).  \n\n By integrating equation (2.14) through the horizontal length L: \n\n \n\n? = ?\n???\n\n???\n?? =  \n\n???\n\n???\n ?  \n\n?\n\n0\n ,  (2.16) \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\n From the equation (2.16), it can be verified that when the wind blows along a channel the \n\neffect on the slope of the water, due to its accumulation, will be higher than if the wind blows \n\nperpendicular to the channel. \n\nAlso, by using equations (2.14) and (2.15), the following is obtained: \n\n \n\n????? =\n????????  ?? ?????\n\n?????????? ????????\n=\n\n???? ?\n2\n\n???\n . (2.17) \n\n \n\nFormula (2.17) mathematically represents the important fact that the wind effect on sea \n\nlevels increases inversely with the water depth ? (Pugh, 2004). \n\nA comparison between the elevation generated by the wind stress and by the direct \n\natmospheric pressure, estimated by equation (2.13), indicates that for depressions in mid-latitude \n\nthe wind stress effect is usually an order of magnitude higher than the pressure effect (Bowden, \n\n1984). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\n3. Study Area: Ria de Aveiro \n \n\nRia de Aveiro (Figure 1) is a shallow water coastal lagoon system, located on the northwest \n\ncoast of Portugal (40\u00b038'N, 8\u00b044'W), separated from the sea by an extensive sand bar and \n\nintegrated in the Vouga river basin. It is 45 km long and 10 km wide, covering an area of 89.2 km2 \n\nat a high spring tide, which is reduced to 64.9 km2 in neap tide conditions (Dias, 2001; Lopes et al, \n\n2010). It has a very irregular and complex geometry, characterised by narrow channels, large areas \n\nof mud flats and salt marshes. The lagoon has also four main channels: Mira Channel, \u00cdlhavo \n\nChannel, Espinheiro Channel and S. Jacinto Channel.  \n\n \n\nFigure  1 \u2013 Map of the Ria de Aveiro, with the location of the main channels and freshwater sources. \n\n \n\n The average depth of the lagoon is about one meter, except in the navigation channels \n\nwhere dredging operations are frequently carried out. The channel connecting the lagoon with the \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nAtlantic Ocean has a depth higher than twenty meters and the other navigation channels are about \n\nseven meters deep. The inlet channel has approximately 1.3 km long and 350 m wide and is fixed \n\nby the North and South breakwater (Dias at al, 2000, Picado et al, 2011). \n\nThe lagoon receives freshwater from the following rivers: Vouga river (draining in the \n\nEspinheiro Channel, and representing the main source of freshwater to the lagoon), Antu\u00e3 river \n\n(draining in the Laranjo basin, the second most important river), Boco river (draining in the \u00cdlhavo \n\nChannel), C\u00e1ster, Gonde and Fontela rivers (flowing in the S. Jacinto Channel) and various effluents \n\nflowing into the upstream end of the Mira Channel (Dias, 2001). \n\nThe lagoon hydrodynamics is tidally dominated by the influence of the oceanic tide, which is \n\npredominantly semidiurnal with a small diurnal pattern (Dias, 2001). The astronomical tidal range \n\nvaries between a maximum of 3.2 m in spring tide and a minimum of 0.6 m in neap tide, with an \n\naverage value of 2 m, whereby the lagoon should be classified as mesotidal (Dias et al, 2000). \n\nAlthough infrequent, the meteorological tide can reach a maximum height of ~1 m (Picado et al, \n\n2013). Concerning tidal asymmetry, until 1987/88 most of the lagoon was flood-dominant (Ara\u00fajo \n\net al, 2008).  Since then, the lagoon is ebb dominant at the mouth and flood dominant at the upper \n\npart. As the lower lagoon is ebb dominant, there is a tendency to export sediments to the ocean \n\n(Dias, 2001; Oliveira et al, 2006; Picado et al, 2013). The lagoon can be considered as vertically \n\nhomogeneous, except occasionally when fresh water inflows are high, and the upper parts of the \n\nlagoon can present vertical stratification (Dias et al, 2000). \n\nIn addition to the oceanic tide and rivers flows, the wind stress also determines the dynamics \n\nof Ria de Aveiro. The wind action, which can last from a few hours to a few days, may induce slight \n\nchanges on local hydrodynamics. This can happen, especially in shallow areas and wide channels, \n\ninducing currents, surface waves and mixing processes in the water column (Dias, 2001). \n\nAnthropogenic action was the dominant factor in the morphological evolution of the lagoon \n\nin the recent past and also affected directly the natural geomorphological evolution of the lagoon \n\n(Picado et al, 2011). The most noteworthy human intervention was the creation of an artificial inlet \n\nin 1808, in response to persistent accretion of the natural inlet, and later the construction of two \n\nbreakwaters (Lopes et al, 2013; Lopes, 2016). The works to extend of the northern breakwater that \n\nfixes the lagoon entrance, one in 1987 and the other in 2012; the regular dredging activities in the \n\ninlet channel and in the lagoon main channels, between 1996 and 1999; and the natural destruction \n\nof great part of the salt pans, due to its lack of preservation, changed the bathymetry and the \n\ngeometry of the lagoon channels (Lopes, 2016). As result, the lagoon became deeper and as \n\nconsequence the tidal wave amplitude increased, and its propagation became faster (Lopes and \n\nDias, 2015). These morphological changes induce modifications in the lagoon hydrodynamics. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\n4. Methodology and Data \n \n\nThe analysis of water level time series recorded by tide gauges is fundamental in \n\nunderstanding the Ria de Aveiro tidal dynamics. However, tidal signals are a complex combination \n\nof the oscillations generated by the gravitational forces of the Moon and the Sun acting on the sea \n\nwater, and irregular oscillations due to atmospheric variability. The separation from non-tidal to \n\ntidal energy is a crucial component in any analysis of water level time series, especially in coastal \n\nwaters.  \n\nThis chapter will describe where and when the sea level and the meteorological data used \n\nwas obtained, as well as the methodologies that were used to analyse them. \n\n \n\n4.1. Data Presentation \n \n\n4.1.1. Sea Level Data \n \n\nThis study was carried out using records by tide gauges located in the main channels of Ria \n\nde Aveiro, which geographical location is represented in Figures 2 and 3 and in Table 1, in three \n\ndifferent time intervals: 1987/88, 2002/03 and 2012 to 2017. This allowed to determine the \n\npossible variations in the tidal characteristics between these periods. \n\nIn 1987/88 and in 2002/03, the sea surface elevation (SSE) used were obtained in the \n\ncontext of general surveys carried out by the Instituto Hidrogr\u00e1fico Portugu\u00eas and by the University \n\nof Aveiro, respectively. In these two-time intervals, the data collection was done only during some \n\nmonths. Between 2012 and 2017, the data were collected monthly and continuously through tide \n\ngauges installed along the Ria de Aveiro as part of the monitoring of the North breakwater \n\nextension, carried out by Administra\u00e7\u00e3o do Porto de Aveiro (APA), except for several malfunctions \n\nof the tide gauges at each station, which caused gaps in sea level measurements (Table 7).  \n\nSea level observations were recorded with a hourly frequency for 1987/88 and 2012, 6 \n\nminutes between 2002 and 2003, and 20 minutes for the years of 2013 to 2017, except for Barra \n\nstation that where sampled every 5 minutes. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\n \n\n               Figure  2 - Geographical position of each tide gauge in Ria de Aveiro (Google Earth, 2017). \n\n \n\nTable 1 - Observation periods and geographical location of the tide gauges. \n\nStation/ \nyear \n\n1987 /1988 2002/2003 2012/2017 Lat.

Meteorological Data \n \n\nWind speed, wind direction and atmospheric pressure data were obtained from the \n\nweather station located at the University of Aveiro. These data were recorded every 10 minutes for \n\nconsecutive days, from 2012 to 2017, with the exception of January 2013. For this month, the \n\nmeteorological data was acquired in a meteorological station with the coordinates 40.9517\u00b0N; \n\n9.375\u00b0W, at 6-hourly time interval. \n\n \n\n4.2. Data Processing and Analysis \n \n\nThe SSE data sets were subjected to several data management procedures, as the finding \n\nand removal of data gaps, interpolation them to have the same sampling period and to fill some \n\ngaps in short time intervals. In the case of long intervals with lack of values, it was assumed that the \n\nmissing values were zero. Due to several equipment failures, measurements between 2012 and \n\n2017 were not always continuous. These failures include problems in the operation of the tide \n\ngauges, but they are also related to changes in the infrastructure on the places where they were \n\nplaced. The stations most affected were Rio Novo and Vista Alegre. The dates with the \n\nmeasurement failures are present in Table 7.  \n\n \n\n4.2.1.  Tidal Harmonic Analysis \n \n\nA Fourier analysis was first made to identify the frequencies and to measure the relative \n\nenergy in the components responsible for the sea level variation at each tide gauge. This analysis \n\nallowed to determine which frequencies bands are the dominant and thus to identify the main \n\nconstituents that influence the circulation of water in Ria de Aveiro. After that, a harmonic analysis \n\nwas applied using the T-Tide application of Matlab (Pawlowicz et al, 2002), for the data of each \n\nstation. Also, the amplitude and the phase of the tidal constituents were determined annually \n\n(corresponding to the total months available for each year, at the different stations). \n\nInitially, the analysis included seven tidal constituents: ?1, ?1, ?2 , ?2, ?4 , ?6 , and ???, \n\nwhere the symbols represent (Bell et al, 2006; Pugh, 2004): \n\n?1- Principal lunar diurnal tide, with a period of 25.82 hrs. This constituent represents the \n\ncycle of maximum declination to minimum declination of the Moon;  \n\n?1\u2013Principal lunisolar diurnal tide, with a period of 23.93 hrs, which arises from Sun and \n\nMoon\u2019s paths over the Equator being at various inclines or declines (angles) to the Equator line; \n\n?2  \u2013 Lunar semi-diurnal tide, which arises from the direct gravitational attraction of Moon \n\non Earth\u2019s waters, with a period of 12.42 hrs; \n\n?2 \u2013 Solar semi-diurnal tide, which arises from the direct gravitational attraction of Sun on \n\nEarth\u2019s waters, with a period of 12.00 hrs; \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\n?4   - Shallow water constituent, generated by the non-linear effects of advection with a \n\nperiod of 6.21 hrs. \n\n?6  - Shallow water constituent, caused by the interaction of the tidal wave with the bottom \n\ndue to the reduced depth, with a period of 4.14 hrs. \n\n??? \u2013 long period tide, with a value of 14.76 days. This period corresponds to the \n\ndifference between the spring tides and the consecutive neap tides; \n\nConcerning the constituents ?1 and ?1, although they have high frequencies (referred in \n\n5.1.1) they do not present any relevant tendency towards the aims of this work, as mentioned in \n\nFradinho (2014), so they are not showed in this document. Therefore, in the analysis presented in \n\nthis work the other five tidal constituents mentioned (?2 , ?2, ?4 , ?6 and ???) will be included.  \n\nAnnual amplitude and phase variation graphics (section 5.1.2) of each harmonic constant \n\nwere made in the different years and for the following stations: Barra, Ponte Varela, Chegado (Cais \n\ndo Bico), Rio Novo, Vagueira and Vista Alegre. This allowed to observe the annual evolution and to \n\nverify if there had been any relevant changes during the time interval in which the data collection \n\ntook place.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2.1.1. Form Number Determination \n \n\nThe Form number will be determined in this work for all stations (section 5.2), between \n\n1987/88 and 2017, using equation: \n\n \n\n? =\n?1+?1\n\n?2+?2\n  (4.1) \n\n \n\nwhere ?1 (Principal lunisolar diurnal), ?1 (Principal lunar diurnal), ?2 (Lunar semi-diurnal) and \n\n?2 (Solar semi-diurnal tide) correspond to the amplitude of the tidal constituents (Pugh, 2004). \n\nWhen the variation of ? is:  \n\n\u2022 0&lt;?&lt;0.25 the tides are considered semidiurnal; \n\n\u2022  0.25 &lt;?&lt;1.5, mixed - mainly semidiurnal; \n\n\u2022  1.5 &lt;?&lt;3.0 mixed - mainly diurnal; \n\n\u2022 ? > 3.0 diurnal. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\n4.2.1.2. Tidal Asymmetry \n \n\nIn section 5.3., tidal asymmetry was determined for all stations. \n\nOne way of determining the type of asymmetry from the phase of the constituents ?2  and \n\n?4 , is to determine the relative phases of these constituents: \n\n \n\n??4 = 2??2 ? ??4   . (4.2) \n\nwhere the tidal flow has a flood dominance at 0 \u00b0 &lt;?&lt;180 \u00b0 and ebb dominance when 180 \u00b0 &lt;? \n\n<360 \u00b0 (Friedrichs and Aubrey, 1988).  \n\nThe term tidal asymmetry usually refers to the tidal wave distortion when it spreads to shallow \n\nwaters, which may result in periods of unequal flood and ebb (Wang et al, 1999).  \n\nThe distortion of the tide as it propagates from the open ocean into the confinement of \n\nestuaries can be represented by the non-linear growth of compound constituents and harmonica \n\nof the principal astronomical components (Friedrichs and Aubrey, 1988). \n\nDue to the overlap of these constituents, the elevation of the free surface of the water and the \n\ncurrent velocity are distorted from its initial sinusoidal form, giving rise to the asymmetry of the \n\ntide. For the specific case where the ebb period is higher than that of the flood, the situation is \n\ncalled flood-dominant, because the highest velocity is reached in the flood. In the opposite case, it \n\nis called ebb-dominant (Dias, 2016b). \n\nTidal asymmetry often plays a key role in determining sediment transport and deposition/ \n\nerosion patterns in several tidal dominated estuaries and inlets. The transport of sediments will \n\ndepend on the maximum velocity. That is, if the maximum velocity is that of the ebb, the sediment \n\nexportation is higher, if it is of the flood, there will be a mean sediment transport to the interior of \n\nthe estuary (Dias, 2016b). \n\nIt is important to know the tidal asymmetry in estuaries mainly due to the fact that the \n\nnavigability of the estuarine channels and the geomorphological evolution will be affected by the \n\nsediment transport and accumulation. That is, an estuary with flood dominance may be unable to \n\neffectively exhale the sediments, hindering navigability, while an estuary with ebb dominance may \n\nmaintain a stable configuration. \n\nThe phases of these two constituents (?2  and  ?4) are used because the dominant \n\nastronomical constituent is ?2 ,  the semi-diurnal lunar tide. Because of ?2   dominance, the most \n\nsignificant overtide formed in well-mixed estuaries, like Ria de Aveiro, is ?4 , the first harmonic of \n\n?2  (Friedrichs and Aubrey, 1988). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\n4.2.2.  Non-Tidal component (Meteorological Residuals) \n \n\nAnnual series of the residual tide were determined for each year of the period between \n\n2012 and 2017 by subtracting the astronomical predicted tides from the measured tidal signal, as \n\ndescribed in equation 2.3.  \n\nAlso, standard deviations of the meteorological residual annual series were determined to \n\nidentify storm surge events. According to the criterion proposed by Pugh (1996), the meteorological \n\ntide events can be identified considering that the residual levels are higher than three times the \n\nstandard deviation (3?) of the residual series (Pugh,1996, Picado et al, 2013). A distinction will be \n\nmade between positive anomalies, whose residual values are higher than 3?, and the negative \n\nones, whose values are lower than ?3?. \n\nIt was not taken into consideration in this analysis those time intervals where several values \n\nwere missing (which were due to the lack of values and problems with the malfunction of the tide \n\ngauge). These time intervals are presented in Table 7 of the Annex.  \n\nTo identify the distribution of positive and negative anomalies, in each station studied, and \n\nunderstand the relationship between meteorological variables and the generation of tidal \n\nelevations, graphs of the atmospheric pressure, wind intensity and direction, precipitation and \n\nwater level and residual graphs, were performed, section 5.4. \n\n A selection of the obtained events was made to distinguish those that were generated by \n\nthe variations of atmospheric pressure and the wind intensity (storm surge), and those that were \n\nformed due to other effects, namely the occurrence of spring tides. Of the events considered storm \n\nsurges, were still considered those that formed remotely and that affected all the lagoon, and those \n\nthat were formed locally. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\n5. Results and Discussion \n \n\nPawlowicz et al (2002) show that the separation of tidal and non-tidal energy is a crucial \n\ncomponent in any analysis of oceanic time series, especially in coastal waters. Based on this \n\nprinciple, in this Chapter the results obtained from the analysis of the data collected at six tide \n\ngauges located in Ria de Aveiro, will be presented and discussed with the aim of studying the \n\nastronomical tidal changes induced by geomorphological modifications over time and determining \n\nthe frequency and main meteorological drivers of the storm surge phenomena, either remotely \n\ngenerated or locally generated. \n\n \n\n5.1. Tidal Analysis  \n \n\n5.1.1 Fourier Spectrum \n \n\nA Fourier analysis was used to identify the frequencies and to measure the relative energy \n\nof components responsible for the sea level variation at each tide gauge. This analysis allowed to \n\ndetermine which are the dominant frequencies band and thus to identify the main constituents \n\ncharacterizing the tidal properties in the Ria de Aveiro. Fourier spectra for each gauge is presented \n\nin Figure 4. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure  4 \u2013 Fourier spectra for each gauge sites used in sea-level analysis, from 2012 to 2017. These spectra \n\nhave frequency as their abscissa (x-axis) and power spectral density (PSD), which is a measure of energy, \n\nas their ordinate (y-axis). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\nThrough the analysis of the six spectra (Figure 4), were not found high differences between \n\nthe tidal dominant frequencies for each station. In all of them the semi-diurnal frequency processes \n\ndominated the tidal forcing, followed by the diurnal tidal frequencies. In the region where the \n\nfrequencies are between 10-1 h-1 to 1 h-1, corresponding to the frequencies of the shallow water \n\nconstituents, it is possible to verify that the quarter-diurnal tidal frequencies have the highest \n\nenergy, followed by sixth-diurnal tidal frequencies. The only observable differences between the \n\nspectra for all stations are related to the frequencies of the long-period constituent, which \n\nfrequency band is smaller in Rio Novo. \n\nNormally the residual process is less energetic (left-hand side of plots), except in situations \n\nof extreme weather events, when the meteorological tidal frequencies are amplified (Dias and \n\nFernandes, 2006). High energy values at the low frequencies are present in all of spectra because \n\nthey were obtained in a large time interval during which have occurred storm surge events, with \n\nRio Novo presenting the highest energy values in this frequency range. This may be related with \n\nhigh precipitation and therefore high discharges from Vouga River. \n\nDias and Fernandes (2006) studied the energy spectrum for stations located between the \n\nmouth of the lagoon and throughout the main channels of Ria de Aveiro in 1987 and 1988. They \n\nalso conclude that the main frequencies were semi-diurnal, followed by diurnal and quarter-diurnal \n\ntidal frequencies at the mouth of the lagoon. The energy spectrum for stations located throughout \n\nthe main channels present similar patterns, although the energy associated with diurnal and semi-\n\ndiurnal frequencies is lower. These authors showed that these tidal oscillations are progressively \n\nattenuated as they propagate landwards. The energy on quarter-diurnal frequencies for these \n\nstations are higher than at the mouth, indicating that these frequencies are amplified inside the \n\nlagoon. The reason for this is that as primary tides propagate into shallow water regions, the shape \n\nof the wave changes and the frictional effects become more pronounced. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\n5.1.2.

The amplitude \n\ndifference between 2002/03 and 2012 is not significant, although there is a slight increase in all \n\nstations located throughout the main channels, except in Barra where there is a small decrease. \n\nFrom 2012 to 2017, the amplitude does not change significantly, apart from Barra, where a \n\ndecrease between 2012 and 2015 was observed. \n\nIt should be noted that, although there is no data for the year 2002/03 at Ponte Varela, the \n\ngeneral trend of the other stations will be considered in the discussion of the results. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nThe amplitude increases from 1987/88 to 2002/03 are of the order of 32.80 cm in Vagueira, \n\n29.92 cm in Cais do Bico/Chegado, 16.32 cm in Rio Novo, 12.06 cm in Vista Alegre and 3.06 cm in \n\nBarra. \n\n \n\n \n\nb) Phase \n\n \n\nFigure  6 \u2013 Phase of tidal constituent ?? in all tide gauges, from 1987/88 to 2017. \n\n \n\nRegarding the phase of ?2  constituent (Figure 6), a decrease was found, in all stations over \n\ntime, from 1987/88 to 2002/03.

A dredging operation \n\ntook place along the main channels of Ria de Aveiro in 1998. The increase in water depth appears \n\nto be the most important factor contributing to results found, since the highest variations occurred \n\nbetween 1987/88 and 2002/03.  \n\nThe slight differences, both in the amplitude and the phase, of these constituents between \n\n2002/03 and the following years, show that the north jetty extension by 200 m of the north jetty in \n\n2012, did not cause great changes in the local dynamics of the tide, confirming the numerical \n\nmodelling predictions by Dias and Mariano (2011). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\n5.1.2.3.

There was an increase in tidal amplitude \n\nfrom 1987/88 to 2002/03 in these tide gauges and a decrease in Barra and Vagueira (Figures 9 and \n\n10). \n\nFrom 1987/88 to 2002/03, the highest amplitude difference was recorded at Cais do \n\nBico/Chegado for both ?4  (2.89 cm) and  ?6  (3.47 cm). Vista Alegre presented the lowest value for \n\n?4  (1.62 cm) and Rio Novo for ?6 , 0.91 cm. In Vagueira and Barra, there was a decrease from \n\n1987/88 to 2002/03, which for ?4  was in the order of 8.95 cm and 0.30 cm, and for  ?6  of 0.46 cm \n\nand 0.27 cm, respectively.  \n\nIn general, the amplitude of ?4  and ?6  increases with the increase of ?2 . This trend is \n\njustified by the transfer of part of the energy from ?2  to the constituents ?4  and ?6 .  Despite this \n\ntrend, there was a decrease in the amplitude of these two constituents in Barra and Vagueira. This \n\ncan be justified by a reduction of the bottom friction due to the increase of the channel depth from \n\nBarra to Vagueira and specifically in the area where the tide gauges are located, a result of the \n\ndredging throughout the lagoon in 1998.  \n\nAs for the constituents previously studied, between 2012 and 2017 the amplitude did not \n\nchange significantly, except for Rio Novo, which values varied but without any trend. This station is \n\ninfluenced by the Vouga river, which represents the main source of freshwater to the lagoon. The \n\nincrease of the flow in certain months of the year can change the values of these two constituents, \n\nsince they are directly dependent on the bottom friction, which is related to the increase of depth. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\nb) Phase \n\n \n\nFigure  11 - Phase of tidal constituent ?? in all tide gauges, from 1987/88 to 2017. \n\n \n\n \n\nRegarding the phase, for the constituents ?4 , from 1987/88 to 2002/03 the phase \n\ndecreased, except for Rio Novo, with the lowest decrease occurring in Cais do Bico/Chegado, \n\n126.77\u00b0 (131.2 min) (Figure 11). For the other stations, the decrease was as follows: 71.19\u00b0 (73.70 \n\nmin) for Vagueira, 43.62\u00b0 (45.15 min) for Vista Alegre and 4.59\u00b0 (4.75 min) for Barra. As for the \n\nconstituents previously studied, between 2012 and 2017 the amplitude did not change significantly, \n\nexcept for Rio Novo, which values varied without any trend. The same pattern was found, for this \n\nstation, for the constituent ?6  (Figure 12). \n\n \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure  12 - Phase of tidal constituent ?? in all tide gauges, from 1987/88 to 2017. \n\n \n\n \n\nFor the constituent ?6 , from 1987/88 to 2002/03, the phase increased in the Cais do \n\nBico/Chegado (262.66\u00b0 which corresponds to 181.24 min), Vagueira (51.80\u00b0 which corresponds \n\nto35.74 min) and Rio Novo (259.64\u00b0 which corresponds to 177.78 min), and decreased in the other \n\nstations. Between 2012 and 2017 the phase did not change significantly, except for Rio Novo in \n\n2015, and for Vista Alegre in 2014. This different behaviour may have occurred because during \n\nthese years measurement anomalies occurred, which may have influenced the results obtained, as \n\npreviously mentioned in methodology section.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\n5.1.2.5.

The amplitude decreased 10.39 cm in Rio Novo, 7.30 cm in Vagueira, 1.33 cm in \n\nVista Alegre, 0.57 cm in Cais do Bico/ Chegado and 1.37 cm in Barra. Between 2012 and 2017, there \n\nis a trend towards the increase of amplitude of this constituent in most stations, although in some \n\nintermediate years an opposite trend is found in Barra and Cais do Bico/Chegado. This means that, \n\nin this last time interval, the amplitude difference between spring and neap tides has been \n\nincreasing. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure  14 - Phase of tidal constituent ??? in all tide gauges, from 1987/88 to 2017. \n\n \n\nAccording to Figure 14, there is a phase increase of ??? constituent in the stations Cais do \n\nBico/Chegado (4.66\u00b0 which corresponds to 4.58 hours), Vagueira (18.45\u00b0 which corresponds to \n\n18.15 hours) e Vista Alegre (5.97\u00b0 which corresponds to 7.00 hours), and a decrease in Rio Novo \n\n(8.69\u00b0 which corresponds to 8.55 hours) and Barra (20.86\u00b0 which corresponds to 20.53 hours), from \n\n1987/88 to 2002/03.

Also, to know and understand the \n\nrelationship between meteorological variables and the generation of residual elevations, graphs of \n\nthe atmospheric pressure, wind intensity and direction, precipitation and water level and residual \n\nwere performed. \n\nA selection of the obtained events was made to distinguish those that were generated by \n\nthe variations of atmospheric pressure and the wind intensity, and those that were formed due to \n\nother effects, namely the occurrence of spring tides. From the different events, a separation \n\nbetween the remotely generated and the locally generated events was also performed. \n\nFrom the different events occurring between 2012 and 2017, where residual values were \n\nhigher than three times the standard deviation of the annual residuals (positive anomalies), only \n\ntwo influenced the entire lagoon (January and December 2013), having been generated by adverse \n\nmeteorological conditions verified at national level. The remainder were manifested only locally in \n\nOctober 2012, March 2013, September 2015 and May 2016. \n\nThe events with negative anomalies occurred in a smaller number, emphasizing only that \n\nthey occurred in February and March of 2015. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\n5.4.1. Analysis of Positive Anomalies \n \n\nDuring the year 2013, positive anomalies were recorded in all the stations under study in \n\nJanuary and December. In October 2012, March 2013, September 2015 and May 2016 were only \n\nverified local events. \n\n \n\nJanuary 2013 \n \n\nBetween January 18th and 19th, 2013, Portugal mainland was affected by extreme weather \n\nconditions. This severe weather, caused by the storm called Gong Storm, affected mainly the centre \n\nand south of Portugal mainland. The rapid drop in pressure caused wind speed to rise, reaching the \n\nmaximum of \u201cForce 12\u201d on Beaufort scale (0 to 12) in some locations (wind speed between                 \n\n25 ms-1 and 33 ms-1), accompanied by heavy rain (Liberato, 2014). \n\nDue to the weather conditions generated by this storm, the water level and the residual \n\nvalues (higher than three times the standard deviation for this month) were recorded on 19 and 20 \n\nJanuary (Figures 15 and 16).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure  15 - Observed water level (m) and residual levels (m) in January 2013, in the stations: \n\na) Barra; b) Ponte Varela; \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure  16 \u2013Observed water level (m) and residual levels (m) in January 2013, in the stations: \n\na) Chegado; b) Rio Novo; c) Vagueira and d) Vista Alegre. \n\n \n\nIn Rio Novo, the highest SSE and residual values recorded were 4.04 m and 1.26 m, \n\nrespectively. The duration of this event in this area was approximately 31 hours between 19 and 20 \n\nJanuary. In other stations, the storm occurred mainly between January 18 and 19, with the highest \n\nSSE values of 3.90 m and the residual of 1.00 m in Vagueira, and in this area, the effect of the storm \n\nwas felt for 13 hours. In Vista Alegre, the value that was recorded for the water level was 3.92 m \n\nand for the residual of 0.98 m, the duration of the event was 10 hours. In the case of Ponte Varela, \n\nChegado and Barra, the duration of the storm was 18 hours, with SSE values being: 3.55 m, 3.82 m \n\nand 3.80 m respectively, and for the residuals of 0.72 m, 0.87 m and   0.66 m. \n\nOne of the effects of the Gong Storm, which was mainly observed on the day 19th, was the \n\nincrease in water level in Ria de Aveiro, as well as in the residual values (Figures 15 and 16).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\nThe large drop in atmospheric pressure, from 1005 hPa to a minimum pressure of 980 hPa \n\n24 hours later (Figure 17), the increase of the wind intensity on that same date (Figure 18), that had \n\na direction change from SW on day 18th to NW on the 19th [Figure 19 a) and b)] and the large \n\nprecipitation (Figure 20), characterize this storm. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure  17 - Atmospheric pressure (hPa), January 2023. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure  18 \u2013Wind speed (m/s), January 2013 \n\n \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\na) \n\n \n\nb) \n\n \n\nFigure  19 - Wind Roses in the days a) 18th and b) 19th January. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure  20 - Rainfall (Kg/m2/s2), January 2013. \n\n \n\n \n\nFrom the mathematical expression 2.13, it is possible to determine the effect of the \n\natmospheric pressure in the sea surface elevation. For this variation of pressure corresponds an \n\nincrease of the SSE of about 35.00 cm. Considering the effect of wind, by equation 2.16, the SSE \n\nmay increase by about 11.60 cm considering its effect along the lagoon channels. Another effect \n\ncaused by the wind tension is the accumulation of water at the banks of the channels, especially in \n\nareas where the wind has perpendicular direction to the banks of the channels. Adding to these \n\nfactors the high value of the precipitation, justifies the values obtained for the SSE and for the \n\nresiduals. On average, the values found for SSE in all stations were 1.00 m higher than the annual \n\naverage for each station. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\nDecember 2013 \n \n\nIn December, between the 24th and 26th, all stations (except Rio Novo, the tide gauge was \n\nwithdrawn on 24 October 2013), recorded meteorological tides (Figure 21). \n\n \n\n                        \n\n                       \n\nFigure  21 - Observed water level (m) and residual levels (m) in December 2013, in the stations: \n\na) Barra; b) Ponte Varela; c) Chegado; d) Vagueira and e) Vista Alegre. \n\n \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\nIn Chegado, the highest SSE and residual values were recorded, being 3.79 m and 0.98 m, \n\nrespectively. The duration of this event in this area, in Ponte Varela and Barra was approximately \n\n22 hours, between 24 and 25 December. In Barra the SSE value was 3.72 m and the residual value \n\nwas 0.56 m. In Ponte Varela, the value of the SSE reached 3.47 m and the residual 1.02 m. In \n\nVagueira, SSE values of 3.70 m and 0.48 m were recorded for the residuals, the storm lasted 6 hours. \n\nAt Vista Alegre, SSE values of 3.41 m were found and for residual values of 0.45 m, with the storm \n\nlasting 12 hours. \n\nAlthough there was an increase in water levels in these days (24th and 25th December), at \n\nall stations, Ponte Varela recorded the highest value between days 23 and 24, for this month. In the \n\nremaining tide gauges, the highest values of SSE were recorded at dates close to the New Moon \u2013 \n\nspring tides. In Vagueira and Vista Alegre on day 5 (New Moon was on the 3rd day) and on Chegado \n\nwas on day 31 (New Moon occurred on the 31st day). \n\n \n\nOnce again, this event occurred due to the combination of different meteorological factors: \n\na marked decrease in atmospheric pressure (below 1000 hPa) on day 24, Figure 22, an increase in \n\nwind intensity and duration, with predominant wind direction of W and SW, as it is shown in Figure \n\n23 a) and b).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure  22 - Atmospheric pressure (hPa), December 2013. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\na) \n \n\n \n\nb) \n \n\n \nFigure  23 \u2013 a) Wind Rose in the days 24th to 26th December. \n\nb) Wind speed (m/s), December 2013. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure  24 - Rainfall (mm/h), December 2013. \n\n \n\nBy theoretically calculating the values of the rise in water level due to the variation of the \n\natmospheric pressure and the action of the wind, using the expressions 2.13 and 2.16, respectively, \n\nit can see that there are values in the order of 30.00 cm for the variation of the atmospheric \n\npressure and 2.60 cm for the wind stress. It was verified that the duration of the wind action was \n\nhigh, more than 24 hours, with predominant W direction, the accumulation of water at the banks \n\nof the channels is a factor to be considered when determining the elevation of the water level, \n\nespecially if the effect of the wind was felt perpendicularly to the margins of the channels than \n\nalong the channels. Adding to these factors, justifies the values obtained for the SSE and for the \n\nresiduals. \n\n \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\nLocal meteorological storm events \n \n\nIn October 2012, March 2013, September 2015 and May 2016 only local generated events \n\nof meteorological tides were found. \n\nThe Ponte Varela area was the region where most events took place. This may be related \n\nto local conditions, such as: the width of the channel, which is the largest when compared to the \n\nrest of the lagoon, with an unobstructed distance over which the wind can blow in a certain \n\ndirection, increasing the size of the water slope on one side of the channel. The mathematical \n\nequation 2.17, also shows that the smaller the depth of the site, the higher the slope; also, the \n\nsurrounding area is more unprotected, and the absence of high vegetation and/or housing, or other \n\ninfrastructure, makes Ponte Varela a place where wind effects are most felt.  \n\n \n\n \n\nOctober 2012 \n \n\nFrom the analysis of Figure 25, it was verified that during October 2012 a meteorological \n\ntide occurred in Ponte Varela. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure  25 - Observed water level (m) and residual levels (m) in: a) Barra and b)  Ponte Varela: \nOctober 2012. \n\n \n\nOne event was recorded between days 25 and 26 lasting 10 hours. The maximum value of \n\nthe SSE was 3.36 m and the residual value was 0.55 m, on the 26th. In Barra meteorological tides \n\ndid not occur during this month. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\nA decrease of the atmospheric pressure below 1000 hPa, occurred between the days 25 \n\nand 26 (Figure 26). The intensity and duration of the wind, on days 27 to 28 (Figure 28), was high, \n\nwith predominant direction of ESE on day 25 and NW on day 26 [Figure 27 a) and b)]. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure  26 \u2013 Atmospheric pressure (hPa), October 2012. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\na) \n\n \n\nb) \n\n \nFigure  27  - a) Wind Rose in the days: a) 25th and b) 26th of October; \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure  28 - Wind speed (m/s), October 2012. \n\n \n\nWith this variation in atmospheric pressure, and wind intensity, using the mathematical \n\nexpressions 2.13 and 2.16, it is possible to verify that theoretically there was an increase in the \n\nwater level of 20.00 cm due to the variation of the atmospheric pressure, but in relation to the wind \n\nthe theoretical value is negligible since the intensity of the wind was not high. As the predominant \n\nESE and NW wind, the water accumulation at the margin in this area of the lagoon was probably \n\nresponsible for the values found for SSE and for the residuals.  \n\nBetween the days 24 and 25 values of precipitation ranged between 0.50 mmh-1 to            \n\n0.80 mmh-1 (Figure 29). The influence of precipitation could have been felt locally, but the main \n\nmeteorological factors for the formation of this event were the variation of the pressure and the \n\nwind intensity and duration. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure  29 \u2013 Rainfall (mm/h), October 2012. \n\n \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\nMarch 2013 \n \n\nIn March 2013, there were values of positive anomalies lasting more than 5 consecutive \n\nhours for Ponte Varela and Chegado stations (Figure 30). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure  30 - Observed water level (m) and residual levels (m) in March in the stations:  \n\na) Barra; b) Ponte Varela and c) Chegado. \n\n \n\nThe highest SSE and residual values were recorded in Chegado (3.85 m and 0.69 m, \n\nrespectively). The duration of this event in this area was approximately 11 hours, between 5 and 6 \n\nMarch. In Ponte Varela the SSE value was 3.60 m and the residual value was        0.68 m, the storm \n\nlasted 18 hours in the same days. In Barra meteorological tides did not occur during this month. \n\nIn this month, the highest SSE in Ponte Varela and Chegado was recorded at the time of \n\nspring tides (New Moon on March 11th and Full Moon on March 27th).

The duration of \n\nthis event in this area was approximately 6 hours, between 15 and 16 September.

The duration of this event in this area was approximately 8 hours, at May 8th. In \n\nChegado and Vista Alegre the storm lasted 5 hours in the same day and the SSE values were 3.85 m \n\nand 3.71 m, and the residual value were 0.81 m and 0.52 m, respectively.

Analysis of Negative Anomalies \n\n \n \n\nNegative anomalies were recorded only in Ponte Varela in the months of February and \n\nMarch 2015 (Figures 42 and 43) . \n\n \n\nFigure  42 - Observed water level (m) and residual levels (m) in 1st to 28th February in: \n\n a)Barra and b) Ponte Varela. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure  43 - Observed water level (m) and residual levels (m) in 1st to 31st March in: \n\na) Barra and b) Ponte Varela. \n\n \n\nIn Ponte Varela, the surface elevation (SSE) and residual values were 0.77 m and                         \n\n0.49 m, in February 17th. The duration of this event in this area was approximately 12 hours. \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\nIn March, two events were recorded, the first between 4th and 5th March and the second \n\nbetween 28th and 31st March. The lowest SSE was in March 5th, 0.84 m, but the lowest residual value \n\nwas -0.53 m in 31st de March. The storm lasted 7 hours between the 4th and 5th March, and 12 hours \n\nbetween the 28th and 31st March. In Barra meteorological tides did not occur during this month. \n\nSpring tides occurred on February 18th and March 5th, and this may have influenced the \n\noccurrence of negative anomalies and the minimum values of water level found in these months. \n\nIn February, between days 16th and 17th, and in March between days 4th and 5th and \n\nbetween 28th and 31th, the atmospheric pressure rose to 1035 hPa (Figure 44 and Figure 45). \n\n \n\nFigure  44 - Atmospheric pressure (hPa), February 2015. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure  45 - Atmospheric pressure (hPa), March 2015. \n\n \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \n\nAs already mentioned, an increase in atmospheric pressure of one hPa will produce a \n\ntheoretical decrease in sea water level of one centimetre (Pugh, 2004). At both time intervals \n\nrecorded in February, the water level drop was around 15.00 cm, but in relation to March, the \n\nhighest variation in atmospheric pressure was observed between days 28th and 31st, with a value of \n\n30 hPa, corresponding to a drop-in water level of approximately 30 cm.  \n\nRegarding the wind intensity in February and March (Figures 46 and 48), ranged between 5 \n\nand 7 ms-1, being the predominant NW direction in February and March 28th to 31st [Figure 47 and \n\n49 b)].

Conclusions \n \n\nTo study the tidal changes induced by geomorphologic modifications between 1987/88 and \n\n2017, the variations in the main constituents of tide in Ria de Aveiro, namely the semidiurnal tides \n\n(?2  and ?2), the shallow water tides ?4  and ?6 , and the fortnightly spring/neap tide cycle (???) \n\nwas studied. \n\nThe semidiurnal tidal constituents, ?2  and ?2, are the most relevant for studies on tide \n\nchanges, due to variations in the geomorphology of Ria de Aveiro, since they are the major \n\nconstituents of the total tidal energy, as reported in the analysis of the Fourier spectra. By analysing \n\nthe amplitude and the tidal phase variation of ?2  and ?2  between 1987/88 and 2002/03, it verified \n\nthat there is an amplitude increase and a decrease of the phase, in all the stations studied.  \n\nDredging in 1998, which increased the depth of the main navigation channels appears to \n\nbe the most important factor contributing to these results, since the greatest variations occurred \n\nbetween 1987/88 and 2002/03. This means that as the main channels become deeper, the tidal \n\nwave amplitude increases, and its propagation becomes faster. \n\nFrom 2002/03 to 2017, the amplitude and phase remained practically constant, showing \n\nthat the extension of the north jetty by 200 m in 2012, did not induce significant changes in the \n\ndynamics of the tide along the lagoon. \n\nAlthough the energy of the shallow water tidal constituents is low, these constituents must \n\nalso be considered, since the bottom friction modifies the propagation of the tidal wave along the \n\nlagoon channels. In the studied tide gauges, the amplitude of constituents ?4  and ?6  increased \n\nbetween 1987/88 and 2002/03. This trend is justified by the transfer of part of the energy from ?2  \n\nto the constituents ?4  and ?6 .  Despite this trend, there was a decrease in the amplitude of these \n\ntwo constituents in Barra and Vagueira. This can be justified by a reduction of the bottom friction \n\ndue to the increase of the channel depth from Barra to Vagueira and specifically in the area where \n\nthe tide gauges are located, resulting of dredging operations throughout the lagoon in 1998.  \n\nThe phase of the constituent  ?4  decreased in all the stations between 1987/88 and \n\n2002/03, except for Rio Novo. For the constituent ?6 , from 1987/88 to 2002/03, the phase \n\nincreased in the Cais do Bico/Chegado, Vagueira and Rio Novo and decreased in the other stations. \n\nBetween the years of 2012 and 2017, the amplitude and phase values of the constituents, ?4  and \n\n?6 , remained practically constant. \n\nThe tidal constituent ??f, represents the variation of the water level in a spring / neap tide \n\ncycle, and is influenced by ?2  and ?2. A decrease in the amplitude from 1987/88 to 2002/03 can \n\nbe observed in most the studied places, except for Ponte Varela. Between 2012 and 2017 the \n\namplitude of this constituent increased in all the tide gauges, which means that in this time interval \n\nthe difference in amplitude between the spring tides and the neap tides has been increasing. \n\nThe increase or decrease of the bottom friction will also change the tidal velocities along \n\nRia de Aveiro channels, making the velocity of the flood and ebb tides unequal, giving rise to the \n\nasymmetry of the tide. This inequality will depend on phases of the ?2  and ?4  constituents. Tidal \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\nasymmetry often plays a key role in determining sediment transport and deposition/erosion \n\npatterns in several tidal dominated estuaries and inlets.  \n\nThe results of this work show that in 1987/88 all stations located in the channels of the \n\nlagoon are flood-dominant, except for Barra that is ebb-dominant from 1987/88 to 2017. \n\n From this date onward, it can see that while the Ponte Varela, Vagueira and Vista Alegre \n\nstations still remain flood-dominant, which means that the maximum velocity during the flood is \n\nhigher than during the ebb and thus the sediment transport is done upstream, the Rio Novo and \n\nChegado stations show ebb dominance, which translates in  higher velocity during the ebb rather \n\nthan the flood, and as such the sediment transport is preferentially done downstream which \n\nincreases the erosion in those places. In Barra was ebb-dominating between 1987/88 and 2017. \n\nAlso, by analysing the values of Form number over these years, the results show that the \n\ntide is predominantly semidiurnal in all lagoon, between 1987/88 and 2017. There are two high \n\ntides and two low tides in a period of 12h and 25 minutes, which corresponds to a half of a lunar \n\nday.  \n\nThe frequency of occurrence of storm surge phenomena between 2012 and 2017 was \n\ndetermined and the meteorological factors that influenced the generation of meteorological tides \n\nwere studied, among them the variation in atmospheric pressure and wind intensity and direction. \n\nThrough the analysis of the tidal residuals it was verified that positive anomalies are more \n\nfrequent than negative anomalies. From the different events occurring between 2012 and 2017, \n\nonly two positive storm surges influenced the entire lagoon (January and December 2013), having \n\nbeen influenced by adverse meteorological conditions verified at national level. The remainder \n\nwere manifested only locally in October 2012, March 2013, September 2015 and May 2016. The \n\nevents with negative anomalies occurred in a smaller number. \n\nThe response of the residual water level to barometric pressure is found to be most \n\nsignificant during periods of low pressure systems. The effect of invert barometer is checked, that \n\nis, a decrease in atmospheric pressure induces an increase in water level and vice-versa. Also, it has \n\nbeen found that when the atmospheric pressure decreases or increases in small time intervals \n\n(approximately 24 hours), the effect is more visible, especially in positive storm surges. Wind is also \n\na determining factor, and it has been verified that high intensity and long duration winds affect the \n\nlagoon. In relation to wind direction, the predominant ones were NW, SW, W and S, the wind \n\ntension can induce the accumulation of water at the banks of the channels. \n\nThe Ponte Varela area was the place where most locally generated events took place. This \n\nmay be related to local conditions, such as: the width of the channel, which is the largest when \n\ncompared to the rest of the lagoon, with an unobstructed distance over which the wind can blow \n\nin a certain direction, increasing the size of the water slope on one side of the channel. Additionally, \n\nthe surrounding area is more unprotected, and the absence of high vegetation and /or housing or \n\nother infrastructure, makes Ponte Varela a place where wind propagation is most felt.  \n\nFrom the analysis of all the studied events, it was verified that the higher values of the sea \n\nwater level and of residual values did not result from the existence of meteorological tides, but due \n\nto the spring tides. Exception for the event that occurred between January 18th and 19th, 2013 \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\nwhose highest values of SSE and residual dues at Vagueira and Vista Alegre stations were recorded \n\nat that date. \n\n Therefore, the interaction of a positive storm event at high tide with a spring tide will be \n\nrisky event, which may influence the occurrence of marginal flooding in the lagoon. \n\nThe existence of tide gauges located along the main channels of the Ria de Aveiro, during \n\nthe time intervals studied, would have helped to analyse the evolution of the tide from the inlet to \n\nthe head of the different channels, and in the study of its variation with the geomorphological \n\nchanges that the lagoon has been suffering over the last years and would have been a plus for this \n\nthesis. \n\nThe possibility of installing a large number of tide gauges along the channels of the Ria de \n\nAveiro will enable a more comprehensive analysis of the various changes that this natural system \n\nwill suffer, either by natural or anthropogenic modifications. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\n7.
