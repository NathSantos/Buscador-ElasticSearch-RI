It differs from organ transplantation by \n\nregenerating patient\u2019s own tissue and organs avoiding the biocompatibility and \n\nlow biofunctionality problems as well as severe immune rejection; which are the \n\nmain problems of organ transplantation. Tissue engineering methods generally \n\nrequire the use of three main components: a porous scaffold that serves as a \n\nmatrix, cells and growth factors. The architecture of the tissue engineered \n\nscaffold is an important factor to take into consideration that can modulate \n\nbiological response and the clinical success of the scaffold.  \n\nFiber-based scaffolds can provide large surface area and highly \n\ninterconnective porous structure for cell attachment and ingrowth as well as \n\nvariety of geometric possibilities that can be regulated depending on the \n\napplication.  \n\nIn the works presented in this thesis, we developed different fiber based \n\nstructures based on two natural origin polymers, chitosan and starch, for use in \n\ntissue engineering.  \n\nIn Chapter III, chitosan fibers and fiber mesh scaffolds were produced by \n\nmeans of wet spinning technique. The tensile strength of produced fibers was \n\naround 205 MPa and Ca-P layer formation could be observed on their surfaces \n\nafter 14 days of immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF). In Chapter IV, these \n\nfibers were then used in further studies for the reinforcement of the structure of a \n\ncomposite material which was consisting of microporous coralline origin \n\nhydroxyapatite microgranules, chitosan membranes and chitosan fibers. This \n\ncomposite architecture showed 88% (w/w) swelling in one hour and preserved its \n\ncomplex structure upon long-term incubation. Chitosan fiber meshes were \n\nobtained by moulding a predetermined amount of wet-spun fibers. After 7 days of \n\nculture, it was found that they were able to support osteoblast-like cell \n\nattachment and proliferation. A bone-like apatite layer was obtained on these \n\n\n\n iv\n\nscaffolds by means of using a simple biomimetic coating process. The apatite \n\nformation was determined by different techniques, including SEM, FTIR-ATR, \n\nEDS, XRD. The influence of biomimetic coating on osteoblast cell behaviour was \n\nalso examined by culturing SaOs-2 cells onto scaffolds. The cell population and \n\nALP enzyme activity were found to be higher in the biomimetic coated scaffolds \n\nthan those in uncoated scaffolds. Furthermore, cell presented more spread and \n\nflat morphology when they were seeded on biomimetic coated scaffolds. \n\nRegarding starch-based fiber structures, wet spinning was used in \n\nChapter VI as an alternative method to melt spinning for production of \n\nstarch/polycaprolactone fiber mesh scaffolds. This method seemed to be a very \n\nreproducible way of obtaining the fiber mesh scaffolds, typically with 77% \n\nporosity and mean pore size 250\u00b5m. The specific surface of the scaffolds was \n\nmeasured around 29 mm2/mm3, which was very similar to natural bone. The \n\nsurfaces of the scaffolds were then treated with plasma under Ar atmosphere. \n\nAlthough both treated and untreated scaffolds exhibited ability for osteoblast-like \n\ncell attachment and proliferation, DNA content and ALP enzyme activity were \n\nhigher in plasma treated scaffolds. \n\nFinally, and as a new approach to mimic the natural extracellular matrix \n\n(ECM), nano- and micro-fiber combined scaffolds from starch/polycaprolactone \n\nblend were designed by means of two step methodology. Electrospinning was \n\nused to obtain nanofibers on melt-spun micro-fiber meshes. With regard to the \n\ncell culture studies with osteoblast-like cells and rat bone marrow stromal cells, \n\nthese new architectures showed excellent cell support ability and very promising \n\nproperties to make them a proper tissue engineering scaffold.   \n\n In summary, results from these works showed that the designed fiber-\n\nbased structures from natural origin polymers could successfully serve as a \n\nscaffold for tissue engineering. \n\n\n\n v\n\nRESUMO  \n\nEngenharia de tecidos \u00e9 um conceito novo que emergiu como uma abordagem \n\nalternativa para a reconstru\u00e7\u00e3o de tecidos e \u00f3rg\u00e3os. Difere da transplanta\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\n\u00f3rg\u00e3os na medida em que gera os tecidos e \u00f3rg\u00e3os do pr\u00f3prio doente \n\nmelhorando desta forma a biocompatibilidade e funcionalidade, assim como \n\nreduzindo o risco de rejei\u00e7\u00e3o pelo sistema imunit\u00e1rio, que s\u00e3o os principais \n\nproblemas associados \u00e0 transplanta\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00f3rg\u00e3os. Geralmente os m\u00e9todos de \n\nengenharia de tecidos requerem o uso de tr\u00eas componentes principais: um \n\nsuporte poroso que serve de matriz, c\u00e9lulas e factores de crescimento. A \n\narquitectura do suporte \u00e9 um aspecto importante a ter em considera\u00e7\u00e3o que \n\npode modular a resposta biol\u00f3gica e o sucesso cl\u00ednico do mesmo a longo prazo. \n\nSuportes \u00e0 base de fibras podem dar origem a uma grande \u00e1rea superficial e a \n\numa estrutura porosa interconectada para a ades\u00e3o migra\u00e7\u00e3o celulares, assim \n\ncomo uma variedade de possibilidades geom\u00e9tricas que podem ser adaptadas \n\ndependendo da aplica\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nNo trabalho apresentado nesta tese foram desenvolvidas, para uso em \n\nengenharia de tecidos, diferentes estruturas \u00e0 base de fibras produzidas a partir \n\nde dois pol\u00edmeros de origem natural, sendo estes o quitosano e o amido. Fibras \n\nde quitosano e suportes \u00e0 base de fibras foram produzidos pela t\u00e9cnica de \u201cwet \n\nspinning\u201d. A resist\u00eancia \u00e0 trac\u00e7\u00e3o das fibras produzidas foi em m\u00e9dia 204.9 MPa \n\ne a forma\u00e7\u00e3o da camada Ca-P foi observada nas suas superf\u00edcies ap\u00f3s 14 dias \n\nde imers\u00e3o em \u201csimulated body fluid\u201d (SBF). Estas fibras foram usadas em \n\nestudos posteriores para o refor\u00e7o da estrutura do material comp\u00f3sito, que \n\nconsiste em microgr\u00e2nulos de hidroxiapatite de origem coralina microporosa, \n\nmembranas e fibras de quitosano. Esta arquitectura comp\u00f3sita apresentou 88% \n\n(p/p) de inchamento ao fim de uma hora e manteve a sua estrutura complexa em \n\nincuba\u00e7\u00f5es prolongadas. Suportes \u00e0 base de fibras de quitosano foram obtidos \n\nmoldando uma quantidade pr\u00e9-determinada de fibras produzidas por \u201cwet-\n\nspinning\u201d. Ap\u00f3s 7 dias de cultura, verificou-se que eram capazes de suportar a \n\n\n\n vi\n\nades\u00e3o e prolifera\u00e7\u00e3o de osteoblastos. Uma camada de apatite id\u00eantica ao osso \n\nfoi obtida nestes suportes atrav\u00e9s de um processo simples de revestimento \n\nbiomim\u00e9tico. A forma\u00e7\u00e3o de apatite foi determinada por diferentes t\u00e9cnicas, tais \n\ncomo: SEM, FTIR-ATR, EDS e XRD. A influ\u00eancia do revestimento biomim\u00e9tico \n\nfoi tamb\u00e9m examinada na actividade celular dos osteoblastos, cultivando c\u00e9lulas \n\nSaOs-2 nos suportes. Observou-se que a popula\u00e7\u00e3o celular e a actividade da \n\nenzima ALP \u00e9 maior nos suportes com revestimento biomim\u00e9tico do que nos \n\nsuportes sem revestimento. Al\u00e9m disso, c\u00e9lulas semeadas nos suportes com \n\nrevestimento biomim\u00e9tico apresentam-se mais espalhadas e com uma \n\nmorfologia plana. \n\nRelativamente \u00e0s estruturas de fibras \u00e0 base de amido, a t\u00e9cnica de \u201cwet \n\nspinning\u201d \u00e9 utilizada como uma alternativa \u00e0 t\u00e9cnica de \u201cmelt spinning\u201d para \n\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o de suportes \u00e0 base de fibras de amido/policaprolactona. Este m\u00e9todo \n\npermite obter de uma forma reprodut\u00edvel suportes \u00e0 base de fibras com 77% de \n\nporosidade e tamanho m\u00e9dio de poro de 250 \u00b5m. A superf\u00edcie espec\u00edfica dos \n\nsuportes \u00e9 de aproximadamente 29 mm2/mm3, que \u00e9 em muito semelhante ao \n\nosso natural. As superf\u00edcies dos suportes foram ent\u00e3o tratadas com plasma em \n\natmosfera \u00e1rgon. Embora ambos os suportes tratados e n\u00e3o tratados por plasma \n\ntenham exibido capacidade para ades\u00e3o e prolifera\u00e7\u00e3o dos osteoblastos, o \n\nconte\u00fado de DNA e a actividade da enzima ALP foram maiores em suportes \n\ntratados.  \n\nNuma nova abordagem para mimetizar a matriz extracelular natural (ECM), \n\nforam concebidos, por uma metodologia em duas etapas, suportes combinados \n\nde nano- e micro-fibras a partir de uma mistura de amido/policaprolactona.  A \n\nt\u00e9cnica de \u201celectrospinning\u201d \u00e9 utilizada para produzir nano-fibras no topo de \n\nmalhas de micro-fibras sendo estas obtidas por \u201cmelt-spun\u201d. No que diz respeito \n\na estudos de culturas celulares com osteoblastos e c\u00e9lulas da medula \u00f3ssea de \n\nrato, estas novas arquitecturas mostraram uma excelente capacidade de suporte \n\ncelular como uma estrutura de engenharia de tecidos. \n\n\n\n vii\n\nEm resumo, os resultados destes trabalhos demonstraram que as estruturas \u00e0 \n\nbase de fibras, concebidas a partir de pol\u00edmeros naturais, podem servir com \n\n\u00eaxito como suporte para engenharia de tecidos.   \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n viii\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n\nAcknowledgments....................................................................................................... i \n\nAbstract...................................................................................................................... iii \n\nResumo ..................................................................................................................... v \n\nTable of Contents..................................................................................................... viii \n\nList of abbreviations ..................................................................................................xv \n\nList of Figures ......................................................................................................... xvii \n\nList of Tables .......................................................................................................... xxii \n\nShort Curriculum Vitae........................................................................................... xxiii \n\nList of Publications ................................................................................................. xxiv \n\nCHAPTER I \n\nGENERAL INTRODUCTION \n\nBIODEGRADABLE POLYMERIC FIBER STRUCTURES IN TISSUE \nENGINEERING.......................................................................................................... 1 \n\nAbstract .................................................................................................................... 2 \n\n1.

In order to obtain three-\n\ndimensional tissue constructs, stem/progenitor cells must be combined with a highly \n\nporous three-dimensional scaffold. However, so far, many of the structures purposed \n\nfor tissue engineering can not meet all the criteria required by an adequate scaffold \n\ndue to the lack of mechanical strength and interconnectivity as well as poor surface \n\ncharacteristics. Fiber-based structures represent a wide range of morphological and \n\ngeometric possibilities that can be tailored for each specific tissue engineering \n\napplication. The present article overviews the research data in tissue engineering \n\ntherapies based on the use of biodegradable fiber architectures as a scaffold. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 3\n\n1. Definition \n\nFibers are the fundamental units of textile and fabrics. They can be directly supplied \n\nfrom nature or produced from synthetic polymers. Both natural and synthetic fibers \n\nand fiber-based structures, so-called biotextiles, have been widely used for \n\nbiomedical applications.  \n\n \u201cBiotextiles\u201d has been defined as a \u201cstructure composed of textile fibers and \n\ndesigned for used in a specific biological environment (e.g. surgical implant), where \n\nits performance depends on its interactions with cells and biological fluids as \n\nmeasured in terms of its biocompatibility and biostability\u201d [1].   \n\nPolymeric fibers that are used in medicine can be manufactured by three main \n\ntechniques; melt spinning [2], dry spinning and wet spinning [3].  All those techniques \n\nare based on an extrusion of a polymer melt or solution. The final properties of the \n\nproduced fibers can be controlled by using different finishing methods for instance \n\nstretching [4] or drying treatments with different solvents [5]. Besides those main \n\ntechniques, some special methods such as electrospinning [6], gel spinning [7] were \n\nalso used in fiber processing. As we will discuss below, due to the structural \n\nsimilarity of electrospun polymeric mats to the natural extracellular matrix, the \n\nelectrospinning process has attracted a great deal of attention in scaffold processing \n\nfor tissue engineering [8]. In a brief, this process is based on the generation of an \n\nelectrical field between a polymeric solution (or a polymer melt) placed in a capillary \n\ntube with a pipette or needle of small diameter and a metal collector. When the \n\nelectrical field reaches its critical value, repulsive electrostatic force overcomes the \n\nsurface tension of the polymer solution and a charged jet is produced. This charged \n\npolymeric jet then undergoes a stretching process which is accompanied by the \n\nrapid solvent evaporation and results the formation of long and thin nano fibers. \n\nElectrospinning have been used to fabricate nanofibrous structures from a number of \n\nboth natural synthetic polymers, such as collagen[9], chitosan [10] , chitin[11] , silk \n\nfibroin[12], hyaluronic acid [13] and poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) [14], poly(L-lactide) \n\n[15], and polycaprolactone [16], among many others. Within last few years, these \n\nnanofibrous structures have been used as a scaffold in many different tissue \n\nengineering applications.   \n\n \n\n\n\n 4\n\n2. Fiber Structures \n\nFibers can be manufactured as monofilaments or multifilaments, they find, for \n\ninstance, application as a suture in surgery. Sutures are the oldest and simplest \n\nexample of the textiles used in medicine. They are made of both biodegradable and \n\nnon-degradable polymers, either natural or synthetic origin.  Dexon\u00ae (polyglycolide; \n\nmultifilament), Dexon Plus\u00ae (polyglycolide, braided), Vicryl\u00ae (poly[glycolide-L-\n\nlactide]; multifilament), Maxon\u00ae (poly[glycolide-co-trimethylene carbonate]; \n\nmonofilament), Biosyn\u00ae (poly[glycolide-co-L-lactide-co-trimethylene carbonate]), and \n\nPDS\u00ae (poly-p-dioxanone; monofilament) are the some examples for commercially \n\navailable biodegradable sutures [17, 18].  \n\nFor more complex applications, fibers can also be formed in 3D structures \n\nsuch as knitted, braided, woven, and non-woven. The orientation of fibers into these \n\nstructures may range from highly regular to completely random. The final structure of \n\nthe fibers affects the behaviors of the fibers when they are applied. For example, \n\nwoven structures show more stable and porous structure than the other fiber \n\nstructures. As a disadvantage, they can be unraveled at the edges when they cut \n\nsquarely or obliquely for implantation. However, knitted structures have inherent \n\nability to resist unraveling when they cut. Moreover, they are very flexible and \n\nporous. But sometimes their flexibility is reduced when the additional yarns are used \n\nto interlock the loops in order to obtain more stable structures. Additionally, \n\ndifficulties of reducing their high porosity below a certain value are another clear \n\ndisadvantage for some applications. Braided structures are mostly used as a suture. \n\nThey can be designed using several different patterns, either with or without core. \n\nThe spaces between the yarns, which cross each other, make them porous and help \n\nthe fluid flow during the healing process. Non-woven structures may have a wide \n\nrange of porosity. Their isotropic structure provides good mechanical and thermal \n\nstability. They can easily compress and expand. These advantages make them a \n\nsuitable material for many tissue engineering applications.    \n\n3. Applications in Tissue Engineering \n\nTissue engineering offers a promising new approach to create biological alternatives \n\nfor regenerating different tissues. It involves typically the use of  stem/progenitor \n\n\n\n 5\n\ncells seeded in a scaffold which can guide the cell growth and tissue formation in \n\nthree dimensions. Several requirements must be considered in the design of tissue \n\nengineering scaffolds, including high porosity, large surface area, adequate pore \n\nsize, and uniformly distributed interconnected porous structures throughout the \n\nmatrix [19-21].  \n\nBiodegradable polymeric fiber structures can provide a large surface area, \n\nand a relatively large porosity which can be optimized for specific applications. \n\nBesides these, many tissues, such as nerve, muscle, tendon, ligament, blood vessel, \n\nbone, and teeth, have tubular or fibrous bundle architectures and anisotropic \n\nproperties. Therefore, fiber-based structures find a number of applications in tissue \n\nengineering, including soft tissue repair, vascular prostheses, bone and cartilage \n\nscaffolds, nerve guides, among others. On the other hand, many parameters must \n\nbe considered in the design of fiber architectures, such as optimal fiber diameter and \n\nlinear density, overall porosity and pore size distribution, influence of fiber orientation \n\non cellular response and influence of degradation on the properties of the structures. \n\n3.1. Soft Tissue Engineering \n\nSkin Replacement \n\nSkin is a complex organ and mainly consisting of a superficial and an inner layer \n\nwhich are called epidermis and dermis, respectively. It is well known that most \n\nwounds can heal naturally. However, the replacement becomes a serious problem \n\nwhen it is irreversibly damaged by burns, trauma or disease. The most common \n\napproach for skin replacement is the use of autografts or allografts [22-24]. But they \n\nhave many limitations including the creation of a donor site, risk of infection and slow \n\nhealing. Over the past two decades, tissue engineering approach have been studied \n\nto construct a three dimensional skin architecture using a temporary scaffold \n\ncombined with fibroblast, keratinocytes and endothelial cells [25, 26].   \n\nBiodegradable fiber-based structures have been proposed to use for healing \n\nor dermal or epidermal injuries. The most successful fiber-based dermal equivalents \n\nare the commercialized products Dermagraft\u00ae and Dermagraft-TC\u00ae. Dermagraft\u00ae is \n\na structure consisting of fibroblasts, extracellular matrix and a biodegradable fiber \n\nmesh [27]. In this product, polyglactin (PLGA) mesh is used as a scaffold for \n\nfibroblasts. The fibroblast proliferated into the scaffolds secrete human dermal \n\n\n\n 6\n\ncollagen, matrix proteins, growth factors and cytokines and create a dermal \n\nsubstitute. It has been already applied clinically to the patients with diabetic foot \n\nulcers. It was found that healing was faster and better in patients with Dermagraft\u00ae \n\ntreatment compared to the control patients (debridement and moist wound healing) \n\n[28, 29]. Dermograft-TC\u00ae is a Silastic covered form of Dermagraft\u00ae  and act as a \n\nnon-biodegradable form due to that covering. It has been also apporoved by FDA to \n\nuse as a dermal substitute. More recently, the PLGA knitted mesh has been \n\ncombined with collagen microsponges for three-dimensional culturing of skin \n\nfibroblast [30]. In this new hybrid approach, the PLGA knitted mesh serves as a \n\nscaffold to support the forming tissue while collagen microsponges help the new and \n\nhomogenous dermal tissue formation.    \n\nBesides those commercialized synthetic fiber structures, natural fibers, such \n\nas chitin, chitosan, alginate and a benzyl ester of hyaluronic acid (Hyaff 11\u00ae), are \n\nalso proposed for wound healing due to their wound healing ability [31].  For \n\ninstance, Hirano et al. [32] developed a new biocompatible dressing material made \n\nof wet spun chitin-acid gylcosaminoglycan fibers that released a portion of the \n\nglycosaminoglycan in the body. Softness and easy handling of these fibers could be \n\nuseful to heal epidermal tissue injuries. \n\nEngineering of dermal tissue with using a non-woven scaffolds based on a \n\nbenzyl ester of hyaloronic acid has been studied by many researchers [29, 33-35]. In \n\norder to obtain a nonwoven mesh structure hyaluronan benzyl ester thread is \n\nproduced by phase separation extrusion technology, then cut, carded and needle-\n\npunched. For instance, Tonello et al. [34] studied the co-culturing of fibroblast and \n\nendothelial cells into a hyaluronan-based fiber mesh to create microcappillary like \n\nstructures in a dermal graft. Such structure could benefit the healing of deeper \n\nlesions where the tissue vascularization is clearly needed.  \n\nElectrospun nanofibrous mats have been also investigated as novel wound \n\ndressing material. Nanofiber matrices show high oxygen permeability due to their \n\nhigh surface area (ranging 5-100m2/g) which also allows fluid accumulation at the \n\nwound site. On the other hand, their pore size is small enough to prevent bacterial \n\npenetration and making them a promis1ing candidate for wound dressing. For \n\ninstance, Katti et al. [36] used electrospining method to produce antibiotic loaded \n\nPoly(lactide-co-glycolide) nanofibrous membranes for wound healing. Collagen-\n\n\n\n 7\n\nbased electrospun mats were also studied for using in tissue engineering \n\napplications including wound healing [37]. \n\nVascular Grafts \n\nBiomedical textiles can find an application in the cardiovascular area namely as \n\nvascular grafts. In order to mimic the soft and flexible structure of natural blood \n\nvessels, they have been used in woven, knitted, or microporous tubular structures. \n\nEarly attempts to develop a vascular graft focused on the use of bypass grafts made \n\nof nondegradable or degradable synthetic materials. Most used non-biodegradable \n\nsynthetic polymeric fiber structures for this purpose are Dacron\u00ae and Teflon\u00ae [38-\n\n40]. Later, fiber structures made of biodegradable polymers were applied as a \n\ntemporary scaffold for the regeneration of blood vessels. The first proposed totally \n\nbiodegradable vascular graft was Polyglactin 910 knitted mesh (Vicryl\u00ae ) in 1979. \n\nThe woven PGA structures have been also evaluated in a rabbit model, as a \n\nvascular graft [41].  \n\nAfter many studies based on directly implantation of biodegradable grafts, \n\ntissue engineering approaches have been started to be applied to the cardiovascular \n\nsystem for namely in the development of a blood vessel substitute. For example, Kim \n\net al. [42] studied the use of nonwoven PGA matrices, which were coated with PLLA \n\nin order to eliminate stability lack of PGA mesh, to design tissue engineering \n\nconstructs. The smooth muscle cells (SMCs) seeded onto these matrices has \n\nshowed high cellular viability and produced high amount of extracellular matrix \n\nproteins. Others have attempted to utilize surface hydrolyzed nonwoven PGA \n\nscaffolds for culturing smooth muscle cells [43].  In another study, Shum-Tim et \n\nal.[44] created a new vascular graft combined of nonwoven PGA mesh and \n\nbiodegradable polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) as a inner and outer layer, respectively. \n\nAfter one week of culturing a mixed cell population of endothelial cells, smooth \n\nmuscle cells and fibroblasts in these tubular structures, the final construct have been \n\nimplanted into a lamb. It has been observed that these tissue engineered constructs \n\ncould resemble the native aorta and be used as vascular substitutes. In a later study \n\n, tubular scaffolds have been designed from nonwoven PGA fabrics which were \n\ncoated with a poly(L-lactide-co-caprolactone) (50/50) porous membrane. The \n\nautografts made of these scaffolds and mixed cells have shown no occlusion or \n\n\n\n 8\n\naneurismal formation when they were implanted in dogs. Moreover, a line of \n\nendothelial cells has been observed at the luminal surface of each autograft. More \n\nrecently, these scaffolds with bone marrow cells have been successfully implanted \n\ninto patients [45].    \n\nIn order to mimic natural structure of blood vessels, Xu et al. [46] suggested \n\nthe use of aligned nanofibrous poly(L-lactide-co-?-caprolactone) scaffolds produced \n\nby electrospinning, and proposedf these systems to use for blood vessel \n\nengineering. They have reported that nanofibers could provide aligned attachment \n\nmigration of smooth muscle cells along the axis of nanofibers In addition, it has been \n\nalso found that distribution and organization of smooth muscle cytoskeleton proteins \n\ninside SMCs were parallel to the direction of the nanofibers.   \n\nProsthetic heart valves \n\nThe other application of biodegradable polymeric fibers in the cardiovascular field is \n\non the tissue engineered of heart valves. The clinically used prosthetic heart valves \n\ninclude xenograft valve, mechanical valve and homograft valve. But there are \n\nlimitations as to the long term benefits of these valve prostheses such as poor \n\ndurability, foreign body reaction, infection, anticoagulation problem or donor scarcity. \n\nRecently, many studies have been undertaken to determine if tissue engineering \n\nprinciples could be used to develop valve tissue substitutes. Seeding of human \n\nfibroblasts, endothelial cells or marrow stromal cells on biodegradable fiber mesh is \n\na new approach for the creation of human autologous tissue engineered heart \n\nvalves. Poylglycolide (PGA) non-woven scaffolds are the most widely used materials \n\nfor this purpose [47-49]. In order to improve cell attachment and proliferation, PGA \n\nand PLA non-woven fiber mesh structures have been coated with poly-4-\n\nhydroxybutyrate and their performance have been tested under dynamical conditions \n\n[50].  \n\nStents \n\nBiodegradable fiber structures have also been proposed for using as a stent [51-54]. \n\nA stent is a expandable mesh tube which mechanically supports vessels against \n\nelastic recoil and reduces the restenosis rate in percutanous coronary interventions \n\n[52]. Biodegradable stents are only used when a temporary airway stenting is \n\n\n\n 9\n\nneeded. For instance, Paclitaxel loaded melt extruded poly-L-lactide fibers have \n\nbeen tried as a temporary stent [52].  Furthermore, Saito et al. [54] studied a \n\nbiodegradable knitted stent made by poly-L-lactide in rabbit airways. The results \n\nhave showed that the knitted tubular PLLA stents could be used like commercially \n\navailable silicone stents.  Nuutinen et al. [51] developed a biodegradable stent from \n\nPLLA fibers using a braiding technique. These stents showed the similar radial \n\npressure stiffness as compared to commercial metallic stents. They have also \n\nstudied the mechanical properties and in vitro degradation of biodegradable knitted \n\nstents made of polylactide, poly(L-lactide-co-DL-lactide) and pol(L-lactide-co-\n\nglycolide) fibers [53]. It has been shown that different chemical composition of these \n\nfiber structures provided for different degradation rates which can be tailored for \n\nspecific applications.  \n\nNerve Tissue Regeneration  \n\nThe nervous system is a complex, sophisticated system that regulates and \n\ncoordinates body activities. It has two major divisions: central nervous system (CNS) \n\nand peripheral nervous system (PNS). The central nervous system consists of the \n\nbrain and the spinal cord, while the peripheral nervous involves all the nerves that \n\nbranch off from the spinal cord to the extremities. Neurons in central nervous system \n\nhave different characteristics and cannot regenerate by themselves. Therefore, \n\nrestoring their function is a major challenge in neurology. Recently, engineering of \n\nneural tissue by means of using scaffolds with or without cells become an alternative \n\nto traditional transplantation methods. For example, Yang et al.[15] developed highly \n\nporous and fibrous PLLA scaffolds prepared by liquid-liquid phase separation \n\nmethods to be used on nerve tissue engineering. These nanofibrous scaffolds \n\nshowed an ability to support nerve stem cell differentiation and neurite outgrowth.   \n\nIn peripheral nervous system, injuries generally affect axons and can be \n\nregenerated by a variety of methods, depending on how far the stumps are apart \n\nfrom each other. To avoid the problems of the autografts and allografts, artificial \n\nnerve guidance channels have been developed. A nerve guide can be defined as a \n\nconduit that bridges the gap between the nerve stumps and directs and supports \n\nnerve regeneration. Most of nerve guides reported in literature have a rigid solid \n\nstructure. Recently, nerve guides based on biodegradable fibers have been studied. \n\n\n\n 10\n\nFor instance, Bini et al. [55] fabricated a nerve guide from microbraided poly(L-lctide-\n\nco-glycolide) fibers, which allowed for a good nutrient transfer due to its microbraided \n\nstructure. They observed a successful regeneration in rats after one month of \n\nimplantation. Later, they used the same approach to produce microbraided chitosan \n\nconduits [56]. However, chitosan based conduits did not show the same success as \n\npoly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) conduits due to the swelling characteristic of chitosan. A \n\nnerve guide from poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) was also fabricated by using a \n\nelectrospinning method [57].    \n\nA nerve guide made of collagen filaments has been proposed as an \n\nalternative to the tube type nerve conduits [58]. The collagen conduits consisting of \n\ntwo thousand collagen filaments showed better regeneration than the collagen tubes \n\n(as a control) in regeneration of rat static nerve. In another study, synthetic \n\nbiodegradable fibers made of poly-L-lactide have been examined using dorsal root \n\nganglia in vitro [59]. PLLA filaments oriented the growth of Schwann cells and \n\nneuritis along the longitudinal axis of the filament. In addition, it has been observed \n\nbetter neurite growth when the filaments were coated with laminin [59]. Steuer et al. \n\n[60] also studied in vitro axonal outgrowth using polylactide filaments coated with rat \n\nSchwann cells.  They demonstrated that axonal outgrowth on polylactide sheets \n\ncoated with Schwann cells (+SC) was 15-fold better than that on sheets without \n\nSchwann cells (?SC). \nAs another engineering approach, Cheng et al. [61] have also reported a \n\nsuccessful axonal regeneration in rats as a result of implantation of a construct \n\nconsisting of Schwann cells seeded on polyglactin 910 fiber scaffolds and \n\nbiomembrane.   \n\n3.2. Hard Tissue Engineering \n\nArticular Cartilage \n\nArticular cartilage of the knee is a highly specialized connective tissue responsible \n\nfor cushioning and lubricating. It is an avascular, anueral, alymphatic tissue and \n\ncontains only one cell type, chondrocytes. Due to this avascular and low cellular \n\nnature, self-healing capacity of articular cartilage is very limited. Various techniques \n\nfor repairing cartilage defects have been developed, including abrasion [62], drilling \n\n[63], microfracture [64], osteochondral grafting [65] and transplantation of tissue \n\n\n\n 11\n\nengineering constructs [66-68]. Many different types of polymeric matrices \n\nwith/without cells have been tested in vitro, as well as in experimental animals, and \n\nin human patients for their ability to promote articular cartilage repair. Recent trends \n\nare toward to use of fiber based structures for engineering of articular cartilage. Most \n\nused biodegradable fiber structures are made by poly-?-hydroxy acids and \n\nhyaluronic acid. In embryonic tissue, hyaluronan is the main component of \n\nextracellular matrix and plays an important role in chondrogenic condensation during \n\nlimb formation [69]. It has been shown that HA can affect the differentiation of \n\nchondrocytes [70]. However, HA can not form easily without any modification and \n\nusually can be modified by means of esterification. As it was previously described, \n\nHyaff\u00ae is a derivative of HA and is being investigated as a scaffold for articular \n\ncartilage repair. For example, Brun et al. [71] have compared Hyaff\u00ae 7 and Hyaff\u00ae \n\n11 nonwoven meshes which have the same fiber thickness, 20\u00b5m, but different in \n\nvitro and in vivo degradation rates. Chicken embryo chondrocytes seeded in both \n\nstructures maintained their phenotype and secrete ECM for up to 3 weeks of in vitro \n\nculture. On the other hand, Hyaff\u00ae11 nonwoven scaffolds with a slower degradation \n\nrate promoted a higher cell proliferation rate. They latter reported on the use of \n\nHyaff\u00ae 11 non-woven scaffolds as a support for mesenchymal progenitor cells which \n\nproduced the main extracellular matrix molecules, accompanied by an occasional \n\nsynthesis of mature type II collagen [72]. Moreover, when those structures were \n\nimplanted in the rabbit knees, with or without cells, there was no inflammatory \n\nresponse and they degraded within 4 months after implantation. Other studies with \n\nhuman chondrocytes and mesenchymal stromal cells also confirmed that Hyaff\u00ae 11 \n\nnonwoven meshes could promote the growth and differentiation of chondrocyte and \n\nproduction of collagen type II, aggrecan and downregulate the production of collagen \n\ntype I [73-75].  \n\nPoly-?-hydroxy acid based fibrous matrices have been widely investigated to \n\nserve as cartilage grafts. For instance, Freed et al. [76-79]have performed several \n\nstudies where they used PGA fiber meshes and freshly isolated chondrocytes to \n\ninvestigate the influence of scaffold properties as well as seeding and culture \n\nmethods on the development of cartilage constructions. Ma et al. [80] have also \n\ninvestigated ways to engineer the cartilage tissue by seeding articular chondrocytes \n\nonto polyglycolic acid non-woven scaffolds. They reported that after the aggregate \n\n\n\n 12\n\nmodulus of the engineered cartilage reached 179+9 kPa after 20 weeks of in vitro \n\ncultivation, which was 40% that of natural articular cartilage.  \n\nIn order to provide the ability of the cells to suspend and making it possible to \n\ndistribute cells within the polymeric mesh, synthetic non woven mesh structures have \n\nbeen combined with some natural derived materials such as alginate, collagen, and \n\nfibrin. Using this approach, Ameer at al. [81] have prepared a composite, which was \n\ncomposed by a polyglycolide non-woven mesh coated by fibrin gel, for use them in \n\nmeniscal surgery. At 4 weeks in culture, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content in fibrin \n\ncoated PGA mesh scaffolds has been found to be better than the uncoated PGA \n\nmesh scaffolds. In another similar study, PLGA meshes with two different \n\ncompositions which are slower resorbing 47.5/52.5 PGA-PLA and faster resorbing \n\n90/10 PGA-PLA have been combined with chondrocyte suspended alginate gel and \n\ntested in vitro and in vivo. Both types of coated copolymer pads have shown uniform \n\ncell distribution and same performance regarding expression of aggrecan, type I \n\ncollagen and type II collagen [82]. However, the construct consisting of 47.5/52.5 \n\nPGA-PLA, alginate and chondrocytes have exhibit a better performance when they \n\nhave been implanted to osteochondral defects of rabbits. It has been also shown that \n\nalginate stimulates the chondrogenic phenotype of the transplanted chondrocytes \n\nand prevents cells from floating out of the defects. Other researchers have used type \n\nI collagen for chondrocyte encapsulation and tried to combine this gel with a \n\nnonwoven polylactide (PLLA) scaffolds [83]. This method allowed for encapsulating a \n\nhigh number of chondrocytes into the scaffolds, quite homogeneously.            \n\nMore recently, collagen type I has been also used to create a web-like structures \n\nwithin the PLGA knitted meshes in order in order to achieve a uniform cell \n\ndistribution [84]. The bovine chondrocytes seeded on these scaffolds have shown a \n\nhomogenous distribution, maintained their phenotype and regenerated cartilaginous \n\nmatrix filling the void spaces in the scaffolds. To obtain thicker scaffolds, the cell/ \n\ncomposite constructs have been laminated or rolled after 1 day of culture and \n\nimplanted subcutaneously in the dorsum of athymic nude mice. In vivo results have \n\ndemonstrated the formation of articular cartilage after 12 weeks of implantation. \n\nThese new approaches have promised to generate structurally regular cartilage.    \n\nThe use of biorectors is a great challenge to obtain a homogenous \n\nscaffold/cell construct for cartilage and bone regeneration. Such systems can \n\nprovide a good nutrient transfer throughout the porosity of the scaffolds which results \n\n\n\n 13\n\nin a better cell migration and production of extracellular matrix at interior part of the \n\nscaffolds. These systems have been successfully applied for creating a tissue \n\nengineered cartilage construct by using fiber based scaffolds. Davisson  et al. [85] \n\nhave been reported the positive effect of perfusion on cell content and extracellular \n\nmatrix production of bovine articular cartilage cultured polyglycolic acid scaffolds. \n\nThe synthesis of sulphated glycosaminoglycan has been found to be 40% higher \n\nwhen compared with static conditions. Griffon et al. [86] compared two different \n\ndynamic culturing techniques for culturing porcine chondrocytes on a scaffold \n\ncomposed of polyglycolic acid mesh or chitosan sponge. A better and uniform cell \n\nattachment has been found where PGA scaffolds used in the vacuum-reactor \n\nsystem.  \n\nFinally, within the last few years, biodegradable non-woven nanofibers, which \n\nare produced by electrospinning, have been started be to used as scaffolds for \n\nregeneration of cartilage. 3D matrix made of polycaprolactone nanofibers with \n\ndiameter of 700 nm have been proposed as a scaffold for cartilage tissue \n\nengineering [87]. The primary chondrocytes that were seeded onto these scaffolds \n\nproliferated and efficiently maintained their differentiated phenotype, as indicated by \n\nthe expression of cartilage-associated genes. In a latter study [88], the same authors \n\ndemonstrated that PCL nanofibrous scaffolds could significantly enhanced the \n\nchondrogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) compared to \n\nthe cell pellet culture system, which is a widely used culture protocol for studying \n\nchondrogenesis of MSC. Collagen based nanofibrous scaffolds have been also \n\npurposed for cartilage tissue engineering. It is well known that collagen is a naturally \n\noccurring polymer and one of the major components of extracellular matrix of animal \n\ntissues. It is found in ECM as fibrillar form with a diameter of 50-300nm. It has been \n\nshown that collagen type II could be electrospun in a nonwoven mats with a fiber \n\ndiameter between 110nm-1.8\u00b5m and use as a scaffold for chondrocyte seeding [89].  \n\nBone  \n\nBone is a complex, dynamic and highly vascular tissue with a large amount of \n\nextracellular matrix and limited cell population. As in all tissue engineering fields, \n\nmany researches [90-94] have been carried out to recreate complexity, stability, and \n\nbiologic function of bone tissue. The most common strategy for engineering of bone \n\n\n\n 14\n\nis to use a scaffold combined with osteoblast or the cells that can \n\nmature/differentiate into osteoblasts and regulating factors that promote cell \n\nattachment, differentiation and mineralized bone formation [95]. The requirements for \n\nthe design and production of an ideal scaffold for bone regeneration are very \n\ncomplex and not yet fully understood. It is generally agreed that it must be a \n\nbiocompatible, porous (more than 90% and pore sizes between 100-350\u00b5m), \n\ninterconnected, and permeable structure to in order permit the ingress of cells and \n\nnutrients. Clearly, the structures designed with biodegradable fibers can meet all \n\nthese criteria and serve as a scaffold for the engineering of bone. Many different \n\nfiber-based polymeric matrices have been tested with different cell types to create a \n\nbone construct. For instance, bone marrow cells seeded in a nonwoven HA \n\npolymeric scaffold (Hyaff 11) in a mineralizing medium, and basic fibroblast growth \n\nfactor (bFGF) have shown mineralization through the expression of the markers Ca, \n\nalkaline phosphatese, osteopontin, bone sialprotein and collagen I [96, 97]. Recently, \n\nMikos and co-workers [90, 98] have been reported a study where they used \n\nbiodegradable fiber mesh scaffolds to create bone substitutes in dynamic culture \n\nconditions. In this study, rat bone marrow cells were seeded onto nonwoven poly(L-\n\nlactic acid) scaffolds which was with a thickness of 1.7mm, a volumetric porosity of \n\n99% and a fiber diameter of 17mm [90]. These constructs have been cultured either \n\nin a flow perfusion biorector or under static conditions. It has been found that \n\nnonwoven PLLA scaffolds could support the attachment, growth and differentiation of \n\nrat bone marrow cells. Moreover, it has been reported that flow perfusion could \n\naccelerate calcified matrix deposition and provide a homogenous cell distribution \n\nthough the interior part of the scaffold. Gomes, Reis et al. [98] used the same \n\napproach to culture rat bone marrow cells in starch-based fiber mesh scaffolds. They \n\nhave observed an increased osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells \n\nwhen they culture on starch-based fiber mesh scaffolds under dynamic conditions. \n\nThey also reported that fiber-based structures were more advantageous than \n\nextruded porous structures due to their highly interconnected structure which \n\nprovides a homogenous tissue formation.         \n\nAlso in our group, we developed chitosan based non-woven structures as \n\nbone tissue engineering scaffolds, using a traditional wet spinning technique [99]. \n\n\n\n 15\n\nWe demonstrated that chitosan non-woven scaffolds had an ability to support \n\nosteoblast cell attachment. \n\n As a new trend in the tissue engineering field, nanofibrous scaffolds \n\nproduced by electrospining process have been also suggested for bone tissue \n\nengineering. For example, non-woven polycaprolactone nanofibrous scaffolds have \n\nbeen tested with mesenchymal stem cells derived from the bone marrow of neonatal \n\nrats under dynamic culture conditions [16]. After 4 weeks of culture, it has been \n\nfound that at least the surfaces of the cell-polymer constructs were covered with cell \n\nmultilayers. Additionally, it has been shown that these structures could support \n\nmineralization and production of type I collagen under dynamic culture conditions. \n\nHowever, colonization by cells of 3D electrospun scaffolds is a major problem due to \n\nthe pore size of the scaffolds which is typically less than average cell size.   Li et al. \n\n[100] have presented the next step in such nanofibrous PCL scaffolds by culturing \n\nhuman mesenchymal stem cells that can differentiate adipogenic, chondrogenic, and \n\nosteogenic lineage in the same matrix. This very promosing result underscores the \n\npotential of using both stem cell and nanofibers in bone tissue engineering. More \n\nrecently, Jin et al [101] used the electrospinning technique to produce nanofibrous \n\nfiber mats with average fiber diameter 700\u00b150nm from silk fibroin with PEO. In vitro \n\nculture studies with human bone marrow stromal cells have shown that these \n\nmatrices, especially after PEO extraction, could support initial cell attachment and \n\ningrowth. \n\nTuzlakoglu, Reis et al. [102] have suggested a new approach to design a \n\nstructure which combines polymeric micro and nanofibers in the same construct.  \n\nThis novel structure is aimed to serve as a scaffold and mimic the physical structure \n\nof ECM for bone tissue regeneration, but simultaneously still providing the macro \n\nsupport that cells do require. Nano and micro fiber combined scaffolds have been \n\noriginally produced from starch based biomaterials by means of a fiber bonding and \n\na electrospinning, two step methodology. The cell culture studies with SaOs-2 \n\nhuman osteoblast-like cell line and rat bone marrow stromal cells demonstrated that \n\npresence of nanofibers influenced cell shape and cytoskeletal organization of the \n\ncells on the nano/micro combined scaffolds as well as cell viability and ALP activity.       \n\nBesides the use of polymeric fiber structures as a scaffold, they also find an \n\napplication for a special kind of bone regeneration in dentistry, as a membrane for \n\nguided tissue regeneration (GTR). These barrier membranes prevent epithelial \n\n\n\n 16\n\nmigration and promote the regeneration of new connective tissue attachment. \n\nVicryl\u00ae periodontal mesh and Gore Resolut\u00ae (composed by polyglycolide fiber and \n\ntrimethylene carbonate) are successfully used for this application [103, 104]. A PLA \n\ncoated knitted PGA mesh was developed and suggested for using as a barrier \n\nmembrane in GTR [105]. Another GTR membrane composed of polycaprolactone \n\nand calcium carbonate has been developed by Fujihara et al. [106], using again a \n\nelectrospining process. \n\nAnterior Cruciate Ligament \n\nLigaments are bands or sheets of fibrous connective tissue between two or more \n\nbones, being responsible for providing the motion and stability of joints and \n\ntransmitting the tensile loads in the musculoskeletal system. Ligaments are mainly \n\nconsisting of collagen fibers which are formed into large bundles with specific \n\norientation. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) connects the femur to the tibia and \n\nacts as a primary stabilizer of the knee motion. A rupture of the ACL can not heal \n\nand a surgically reconstruction is required to restore normal joint function. Tissue \n\nengineering offers a potential technique to design ligament replacement grafts by \n\nusing a biodegradable scaffold with/without cells. An ideal scaffold for ACL must \n\nprovide a high degree of mechanical strength initially and loose its strength by \n\ngradually degradation while a new tissue is remodelling. Due to the natural structure \n\nof ACL, collagen-based fiber scaffolds are widely used for ACL replacement [107, \n\n108]. The mechanical strength and the control of degradation rate of collagen \n\nscaffolds could be improved by crosslinking for instance with UV or carbodiimide \n\n(EDC) [108]. However, it has been shown that both crosslinking methods had \n\ndifferent advantages on with regards to the final mechanical strength and the \n\ncorrespondent cell attachment.  Silk is another natural polymer that has been \n\nproposed for tissue engineering of anterior cruciate ligaments[109]. When they are \n\nproperly prepared, silk fiber matrices, which have good mechanical properties as \n\nwell as biocompatibility and slow degradation, can serve as a suitable matrices to \n\nsupport adult stem cell differentiation toward ligament lineages. Hyaluronic acid \n\nbased fibers are another natural origin alternative for ACL replacement.  Cristino et \n\nal. [110]  have designed a prototype scaffold with a multilayered knitted cylindrical \n\narray of Hyaff 11 fibers oriented in two directions. They indicated that mesenchymal \n\n\n\n 17\n\nstem cells grown on these scaffolds could express collagen type I, type III, laminin, \n\nfibronectin, and actin which are the characteristic markers for the ligament tissue.  \n\nAlternative biodegradable materials in anterior cruciate ligament \n\nreconstructions are the synthetic polymers, namely polydioxanone, polylactide, \n\npolyglycolide and their copolymers. These materials have been purposed either as \n\nan implant for using directly or a scaffold for creating three-dimensional tissue \n\nengineering constructs. Based on the first approach, commercially available \n\npolydioxanone (PDS\u00ae) has been suggested for ACL replacement [111] . However, \n\nthis material shows very fast degradation that can be a problem for this application. It \n\nhas been reported that PDS loose the half of its tensile strength in about 4-6 weeks, \n\nwhereas the process for replacements can take up to 12 months [112]. A similar \n\nproblem has occurred when braided polyglycolide (Dexon\u00ae) ligaments were used for \n\nthe replacement. For example, Cabaud et al. [113] used braided polyglycolide \n\n(Dexon\u00ae) ligaments, which showed 828N max. linear load at 22.6% strain, for the \n\nrepair of ACL of dogs. Although they showed high initial strength, degradation time \n\nwas not long enough to protect the repaired ligament. In a later study, Laitinen et al. \n\n[114] tested the mechanical properties of braided poly(L-lactide) implants in vitro and \n\nafter subcutaneous implantation in rabbits. These implants have shown a better \n\nmechanical strength and slower degradation rate than PDS and PGA that would be \n\nadvantageous for reconstruction of ACL. Within the last few years, biodegradable \n\nsynthetic fibers have been formed into 3-D scaffolds for engineering of ACL. Cooper \n\net al. have developed a new braiding procedure to create 3-D scaffolds with a \n\ndesired pore diameter, porosity, mechanical properties and geometry from different \n\npolyesters, namely PLLA, PGA and PLAGA [115, 116]. Although PGA scaffolds have \n\nshowed a highest tensile strength, they have supported lowest level of ACL cell \n\nattachment and growth compared to PLAGA and PLA due to their fast degradation \n\ntime and released degradation product during cell culture. On the other hand, \n\nfibronectin coated PLLA scaffold have provide for a better cell viability than PGA and \n\nPLAGA and maintained their structural integrity and high mechanical properties over \n\nculturing period [115]. These results confirm that tissue engineering of ACL using \n\nfiber based scaffolds and ACL cells is a promising approach for ACL reconstruction.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 18\n\n4. Conclusions and Future Aspects \n\nTissue engineering is a relatively new approach that purposes the regeneration of \n\ntissues by using stem/progenitor cells and scaffolds or artificial extracellular \n\nmatrices. The design of an ideal scaffold still remains as a problem in most of the \n\ntissue engineering fields. Although it is specific for each tissue, it is generally agreed \n\nthat biocompatibility, biodegradability, porosity and interconnectivity, as well as \n\nsurface properties are main requirements for an ideal scaffold. Fiber-based \n\narchitectures described in this review seem to be quite promising scaffolds in many \n\ndifferent tissue engineering applications due to their highly porous and \n\ninterconnected pore structures as well as mechanical strength and structural \n\nintegrity, combined with a large surface area. However, there are still many issues to \n\nbe addressed, including the choice of a proper material, the combination and \n\ndiameter of fibers (distinct for different applications and cell sources), and scaffold \n\ngeometry for each specific application.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 19\n\nReferences \n\n1.

Materials: \n\nThe materials used in the studies described in the present thesis were the \n\nfollowing: \n\nA. Chitosan \n\nThe chitosan used in the studies of the present thesis was a medium molecular \n\nweight with a deacetylation degree of 87%. It was obtained from Aldrich \n\nChemical Co. \n\nChitosan is a deacetylated derivative of chitin which is the second most \n\nabundant natural biopolymer after cellulose, being commonly found in shells of \n\nmarine crustaceans and cell walls of fungi [1]. It is a linear polysaccharide, \n\ncomposed of glucosamine and N-acetyl glucosamine linked in a ?(1-4) manner. \n\n(Figure 1). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Chemical structure of chitosan  \n\nThe degree of deacetylation of chitosan refers to the ratio between \n\nglucosamine and N-acetyl glucosamine.  Depending on the source and \n\npreparation procedure, its molecular weight may range from 300 to over \n\n1000kDa with the degree of deacetylation from 30% to 95%. Chitosan is typically \n\nnot soluble in aqueous solutions above pH 7. However, chitosan solutions can be \n\nobtained in dilute acids which protonates amino groups on glucosamine, \n\nrendering the polymer positively charged. Above the pH 6.2, the chitosan solution \n\nshows a gel-like precipitation due to the neutralization of free amine groups and \n\nthe consequent removal of repulsive interchain electrostatic forces which allows \n\nfor hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction between chains. This \n\n\n\n 31\n\nbehaviour of the chitosan allows for the wet spinning (which is based on \n\nsolution/precipitation) of the polymer  \n\nB. Starch/Polycaprolactone Blend \n\nIn the present studies, a starch/polycaprolactone (30/70 wt/wt) blend was used \n\nfor the production of the fibers.  \n\nStarch is a natural polymer which occurs widely in plants such as corn, \n\npotato and rice. It consists of two types of molecules, amylose and amylopectin \n\n(Figure 2). Amylose is a linear polymer and makes up about 20% wt of the \n\nstarch. The other component, amylopectin, has a branched structure and made \n\nup about 80% of the starch. The relative proportions of amylose to amylopectin \n\ndepend on the source of the starch [2].  \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Chemical structure of starch.  \n\nStarch is an inexpensive, totally biodegradable polymer found in a wide \n\nvariety of environments and used in many industrial applications, mainly as a raw \n\nmaterial for packaging. However, starch itself has poor mechanical properties \n\nand it is difficult to process. Moreover, pure starch articles and even those \n\nderived from the so-called thermoplastic starch (starch with disrupted granular \n\nstructure), are usually brittle and moisture sensitive, thus strongly limiting their \n\npotential fields of application. To overcome this problem, starch can be blended \n\nwith different polyesters such as polycaprolactone, polylactide, etc [3, 4]. \n\n\n\n 32\n\n(CH2)5O\nO\nC\n\nn\n\n(CH2)5O\nO\nC\n\nn\n\nIn the present studies, the synthetic part of the used blend was \n\npolycaprolactone which is a biodegradable polyester synthesized by a ring \n\nopening polymerization of a cylic lactone monomer (i.e. ?-caprolactone) (Figure \n\n3).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3. Chemical structure of polycaprolactone.  \n\nIt is a hydrophobic and a semicrystalline polymer with a glass transition \n\ntemperature about -60\u00b0C. High permeability of polycaprolactone to various \n\nsubstances makes it capable for long-term implantable drug delivery \n\napplications. However, it shows slower in vivo degradation than poly(?-hydroxy \n\nacids). It has been reported that the biodegradation rate of PCL can significantly \n\nincrease in the presence of starch [5]. \n\nC. Bioglass\u00ae \n\nBioglass\u00ae with a particle size of 5\u00b5m was supplied by US Biomaterials Corp. \n\n(Florida, USA), being used in biomimetic coating studies as a nucleation-inducing \n\nagent.  \n\nII. Production Methods \n\nA. Wet Spinning \n\nWet spinning is the oldest method of fiber spinning. This process is based on \n\nsolution/precipitation. Basically, the polymer is dissolved in a suitable solvent. \n\nAfter passing through the spinneret, the solution enters into a coagulation bath. \n\nEither the bath reacts chemically to coagulate the polymer, or it draws out the \n\nsolvent from the polymer stream so that the filament can harden. In most cases, \n\nthe second liquid is aqueous. A main difference between wet spinning and either \n\n\n\n 33\n\nmelt or dry spinning is that one is spinning into a fluid with a much higher \n\nviscosity. Due to this higher viscosity, higher shearing stress occurs on fiber \n\nsurfaces which introduce very high tension into the filaments. Figure 4 shows the \n\nschematic presentation of the production of wet spun fibers in large scale. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4. Schematic diagram of wet-spinning process. \n\nThe extrusion may be out directly into the coagulating liquid or through a \n\nsmall air-gap. In the second case it is known as dry-jet wet spinning or air-gap \n\nwet spinning.   \n\nWet spinning method is mostly used to produce fibers from natural \n\npolymers, such as chitin and chitosan fibers which can not be formed by either \n\nmelt or dry spinning methods. The strong inter-chain forces as derived from the \n\nhydroxyl, acetamido and amino groups, raise the melting point of chitin and \n\nchitosan to well above their thermal degradation temperatures. Therefore, melt \n\nspinning is typically not possible for chitin and chitosan. Besides that, these two \n\nnatural polymers can only be dissolved in polar solvents which have high boiling \n\npoints. As a consequence, dry spinning is also not practical for producing chitin \n\nand chitosan fibers.  \n\nIn the studies described in present thesis, the wet spinning technique was \n\nused to produce chitosan fibers and fiber mesh scaffolds, as well as SPCL fiber \n\ndrawing\n\nbobins\n\nfilter\n\nMetering \npump\n\nvessel\n\nPolymer solution\n\ndrying\ncoagulation bath\n\ndrawingdrawing\n\nbobinsbobins\n\nfilterfilter\n\nMetering \npump\n\nMetering \npump\n\nvessel\n\nPolymer solutionPolymer solution\n\ndryingdrying\ncoagulation bath\n\n\n\n 34\n\nwashing\n\ntreatment \nwith methanol\n\nRolling onto a support and \ndrying at r.t.\n\nMoulding and \ndrying at 60\u00b0C\n\nchitosan fibers\n\nchitosan fiber mesh scaffolds\n\nChitosan solution\n\nalkaline bath\n\nmesh scaffolds.

Shematic representation of the production of chitosan fibers and fiber \nmesh scaffolds.  \n\nBriefly, chitosan was dissolved in aq. 2% (v/v) acetic acid solution in 5% \n\n(w/v) concentration at room temperature overnight. Methanol was added to dilute \n\nthe viscous solution for easy injection until reaching 3% (w/v) final concentration. \n\nGlycerol was used as a plasticizer (2.5% (w/w)). After filtration with a cloth filter, \n\nthe solution was placed in an ultrasonic bath to remove the air bubbles. The clear \n\nsolution was injected into a coagulation bath (30% 1N Na2SO4, 10% 1N NaOH \n\nand distilled water) by using a syringe pump (Word Precision Instruments, UK). \n\nThe formed fibers were kept in this coagulation medium for one day and then \n\nwashed several times with distilled water. In the case of chitosan fibers, they \n\nwere suspended in an aq. 30% methanol for 4-5h and subsequently in aq. 50% \n\nmethanol overnight. The filaments are then the wounded onto a cylindrical mould \n\nand dried at room temperature. In order to obtain fiber meshes, the suspended \n\nfibers were treated with aq. 50% methanol and 100% methanol for 1 and 3 h \n\nrespectively. The fibers were then put in a plastic cylindrical mould and dried at \n\n60\u00b0C overnight.  \n\nThe fiber mesh scaffolds from SPCL were also prepared by wet spinning \n\ntechnique. In this case, the polymer solution with a high viscosity (40% (w/v)) \n\n\n\n 35\n\nwas prepared by dissolving SPCL in chloroform. The homogenous polymer \n\nsolution was subsequently extruded into the coagulation bath containing \n\nmethanol. The high viscosity of the polymer solution and high extrusion rate were \n\nchosen to provide the fall of the polymer solution stream to the bottom of the \n\nbath. This approach allowed to form 3-D scaffolds in the bottom of the \n\ncoagulation bath by means of a random movement. The scaffolds were kept in \n\nthe bath until coagulation is completed and dried at room temperature to remove \n\nthe remaining solvents \n\nB. Electrospinning \n\nElectrospinning is another fiber processing method which allows to obtain \n\nsubmicron size fibers (below 3nm) from a polymer solution or melt. This process \n\nis based on an electrostatic potential (typically up to 30kV) that is applied \n\nbetween a spinneret and a collector [6]. Both the spinneret and the collector must \n\nbe electrically conductive and separated at a distance of around 10-25cm. In a \n\ntypical electrospinning process, a fluid is slowly pumped through the spinneret. \n\nThis fluid is usually a solution, whereby the solvent can evaporate during the \n\nspinning process. The spinning of the polymeric melt is more complicated due to \n\nthe fast solidification process under a dynamic spinning condition at high \n\ntemperatures and usually does not allow for the forming of uniform submicron-\n\nsized fibers. The electrical charge is subjected to the spinneret tip that contains \n\nthe fluid droplet held by its own surface tension. As the intensity of electrical \n\ncharge increases, the polymer droplet becomes as a conical shape, known as \n\nthe Taylor cone [7]. When the surface tension of the fluid can be overcome, the \n\ndroplet becomes unstable and charged jet fluid is ejected from the tip. This \n\ncharged jet then goes to a stretching process that leads the formation of nano-\n\nsize fiber by evaporation of the solvent. In the case of polymer melt the \n\ndischarged jet solidifies during the travel in the air.  The final fiber diameter \n\ndepends on various parameters, including applied voltage, the distance between \n\nthe tip and the collector, used solvent, concentration of the polymer solution, etc \n\n[8]  \n\n\n\n 36\n\nSPCL scaffolds\n\nHigh voltage\npower supply\n\npolymer solution\n\ncharged fibers\n\nTaylor cone\n\ndynamic collection  plate\nSPCL scaffolds\n\nHigh voltage\npower supply\n\npolymer solution\n\ncharged fibers\n\nTaylor cone\n\ndynamic collection  plate\n\nHigh voltage\npower supply\n\npolymer solution\n\ncharged fibers\n\nTaylor cone\n\ndynamic collection  plate\n\nIn the present thesis, electrospinning was used for the development of \n\nnano- and micro-fiber combined scaffolds as described in detail in Chapter VI. In \n\nbrief, the polymeric solution with a concentration of 10% was prepared by \n\ndissolving starch/polycaprolactone (SPCL, 30/70) in a solvent system consisting \n\nof chloroform and dimethylformamide (DMF) with a ratio of 7/3, respectively. \n\nDimethylformamide was used to enhance the conductivity of the polymer solution \n\nfor this process. Electrospinning apparatus used in the study is presented \n\nschematically in Figure 6. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 6. Experimental set-up for electrospinning of SPCL nano-fibers onto SPCL \nmicro-fiber meshes. \n\nThe polymer solution was vertically placed in a simple capillary tube. \n\nSPCL scaffolds produced by fiber bonding method were put onto a special \n\ndesign metal collector which is movable through the electrospun polymeric jets. \n\nThe distance between the tip of capillary and collector was adjusted to 10 cm. A \n\nhigh voltage of 15kV was applied by a high voltage supplier (Gamma High \n\nVoltage, USA) for 10s. The time was selected by considering the proportion \n\nbetween the spinning time and the amount of electrospun nano-fibers. The final \n\nconstructs were allowed to dry overnight at room temperature. \n\nC. In vitro Bioactivity Testing and Biomimetic Coatings \n\nC. 1. In vitro Bioactivity \n\nIn vivo bioactivity of a material can be predicted by assessing the bone-like \n\napatite formation on its surface in simulated body fluid (SBF) in vitro. The \n\n\n\n 37\n\nbioactivity test for the chitosan fibers was carried out with the use of standard in \n\nvitro procedure described by Kokubo et al. [9]. The ion concentrations of SBF \n\nsolution used in this study were similar to human blood plasma as presented in \n\nTable 1.  \n\n \n\nTable 1.

The fibers were removed \n\nand washed carefully with distilled water at different time intervals (3, 7, 14, 30 \n\ndays). They were then dried at room temperature before analysis.  \n\nC. 2. Biomimetic Coating \n\nWhen a material is not bioactive or showing delayed bioactivity, a biomimetic \n\ncoating approach can be used to obtain a bone-like apatite layer on its surface \n\nbefore in vivo implantation. Different functional groups can be introduced on to \n\nthe materials surfaces, such as Si-OH, Ti-OH and carboxyl or carboxylate [10]. In \n\nthe present thesis, Bioglass\u00ae was used to introduce functional Si-OH groups on \n\nthe chitosan fiber mesh scaffolds.  \n\nRegarding the biomimetic coating experiments, an innovative and simple \n\nBioglass\u00ae spraying method was developed in order to obtain Ca-P layers on the \n\nscaffolds. The spraying approach was chosen to have a homogenous distribution \n\nof the Bioglass\u00ae particles on the complex fiber mesh structure. Figure 7 presents \n\nschematically the experimental procedure followed in this study. In brief, the \n\nBioglass\u00ae particles were suspended in ultra-pure water and the suspension was \n\nplaced into a simple container with a spray.

After 7 days of immersion, the samples were removed from the \n\nsolution, washed several times with distilled water and dried at room temperature \n\nbefore analysis.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7.

Plasma Treatment \n\nPlasma treatment, using different inert gases or monomers, is one of the most \n\ncommonly used techniques for surface modification of the materials. As it is \n\ndiscussed in Chapter V, Ar plasma treatment was applied to wet-spun SPCL fiber \n\nmesh scaffolds to enhance the cell attachment and proliferation capability on \n\nthem. The plasma reactor (Gala Instrument GmbH, Germany) used in this study \n\nallows for a fully automated process and has a control reactor with a chamber \n\nCaO-SiO2 \n(Bioglass\u00ae) \n\nCa-P layer \nCa2+\n\nNa+\n\nMg2+ \nCa2+\n\nH3O\n+ \n\nSO4\n2- \n\nHPO4\n2- \n\nK+\nCl-\n\nHCO3\n- Si-OH \n\n\n\n 39\n\nsize of 15 cm diameter and 31 cm length (5L). The scaffolds were hanged onto a \n\nmetal wire with a distance of 1cm between them and then placed into the \n\nchamber. The air present in the system was first displaced with argon, by \n\nflushing argon through the reactor. The outlet was then closed, and the reactor \n\nwas filled with argon with a controlled pressure of 0.18 mbar. The power of the \n\nplasma was set at 30W and the scaffolds were exposed to plasma for 15 min. In \n\nthe end of this period, they were kept at ambient conditions before using in \n\nfurther studies. \n\nIII. Characterization Methods for the Developed Structures: \n\nA. Morphology  \n\nMorphologies of the scaffolds developed in the studies were analyzed under an \n\noptical microscope and a scanning electron microscope (SEM). In order to \n\nexamine the nanofiber amount and distribution on the developed nano- and \n\nmicro-fiber combined scaffolds, both sides of the samples were observed under \n\nan optical microscope (Olympus, MIC-D). Light transmission microscopy images \n\nwere taken for HA/chitosan multichannel structures in order to see the placement \n\nof the components within the structure. SEM (Leica Cambridge S360 \n\nmicroscope) was used for all developed scaffolds to analyze the overall structure \n\nas well as the surfaces. All the samples were sputtered coated with gold and the \n\nanalysis were performed at an accelerating voltage 15 kV and magnifications \n\nbetween 15-5000 times. \n\nIn the case of wet spun starch-based fiber meshes, a \u00b5CT imaging system \n\n(\u00b5CT40, Scanco Medical AG, Bassersdorf, Switzerland) with a nominal resolution \n\nof 12 \u00b5m was also used to determine the mean pore size, total porosity, surface-\n\nto volume ratio, mean fiber diameter of the wet-spun SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds. \n\nThe reconstructed images were filtered using a constrained 3D Gaussian filter to \n\npartially suppress noise in the volumes (? = 1.2 voxel, support = 1 voxel), and \n\nbinarized using a global threshold. Standard 3D morphometry as developed for \n\ntrabecular bone was used to assess structural parameters for the scaffolds. Pore \n\n\n\n 40\n\nsize and fiber thickness were determined using the distance transformation \n\nmethod. In this method, each pore (fiber) is filled with a non-redundant set of \n\nmaximal spheres. Mean pore (fiber) size was then calculated as the volume-\n\naveraged diameter of all spheres making up the pore (fiber).  \n\nB. Surface Analysis \n\nB. 1.  Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS):  \n\nEnergy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) is an analytical technique that is used to \nidentify the elemental composition of the specimen. It is based on utilization of x-\n\nrays that are emitted from the specimen when bombarded by the electron beam \n\nof SEM. In the present thesis, EDS technique was employed to determine Ca \n\nand P elements on the surface of the samples after either bioactivity test or \n\nbiomimetic coating. All the samples were coated with carbon by ion sputtering \n\nbefore analysis.  \n\nB. 2.  Fourier Transform Infrared Attenuated Total Reflectance \nSpectroscopy (FTIR-ATR): \n\nFourier transform infrared attenuated total reflectance spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR) \n\nwas used to evaluate the presence of Ca-P bioactive layer on chitosan fiber \n\nmesh scaffolds after biomimetic coating. FTIR spectra were recorded at least at \n\n32 scans with a resolution of 2cm-1 in a FTIR spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer \n\nSystem 1600) with an attenuated total reflectance device from SPECAC (MKII \n\nGolden Gate, diamond crystal, penetration depth 20\u00b5m, active area 0.8 mm2).  \n\nB. 3.  Thin film X-Ray Diffraction (TF-XRD) \n\nX-ray diffraction technique (XRD) is used to provide information on structure, \n\nphases, crystal orientation and other structural parameters such as crystallinity, \n\nstrain, and crystal defects for the crystalline materials. In this thesis, TF-XRD \n\n(Philips X'Pert MPD, The Netherlands) was utilized for identifiying the crystalline \n\nphases present, and characterizing the crystalline/amorphous nature of the \n\n\n\n 41\n\nformed Ca-P layer on chitosan fiber mesh scaffolds after biomimetic coating. The \n\ndata collection was performed by 2?  scan method with 1\u00ba as incident beam \n\nangle using CuK? X-ray line and a scan speed of 0.05\u00ba/min in 2?. \n\nB. 4. X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) \n\nXPS is used in major and minor elemental identification and chemical bonding \n\ninformation at the surface. It provides information about elemental composition of \n\nthe surface approximately the top 100 \u00c5. \n\n In Chapter V, XPS analysis was performed to determine the chemical \n\nchanges on the surface of SPCL wet-spun fiber mesh scaffolds after plasma \n\ntreatment, using an 250 iXL ESCA instrument (VG Scientific) equipped with two \n\nX-Ray sources: a source with Al Ka1,2 monochromatized radiation at 1486.92 eV \n\nand another one (Dual) equipped with two anodes: Mg and Al. Further details of \n\nthe analysis are discussed in Chapter V.  \n\nC. Inductively Coupled Plasma- Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) \n\nOne possible way to follow Ca-P layer formation during bioactivity test is to \n\nmeasure the changes in Ca and P ion concentration of SBF solution. In the case \n\nof bioactivity test for chitosan fibers, the immersion solutions were analyzed after \n\neach time interval by Inductively Coupled Plasma- Optical Emission \n\nSpectroscopy (ICP-OES, JY 70 plus, Jobin Yvon, France).   \n\nD. Swelling test \n\nThe swelling ratios of samples were determined in 0.154M NaCl aqueous \n\nisotonic saline solution (pH=7.4) at 37\u00b0C. The immersed samples were taken out \n\nfrom the solution at various time intervals, and wet weight of the samples were \n\ndetermined by blotting them with filter paper to remove the excess water on the \n\nsurface  and then immediately weighing on an analytical balance. The \n\nexperiment was continued until reaching of an equilibrium value. The equilibrium \n\nswelling percentage of samples was calculated as follows: \n\n\n\n 42\n\n \n\nS%= (mw-mi)/mi x 100 \n\nwhere S% is the percentage of swelling, mw  donates the swollen weight of the \n\nsamples and mi is the initial weight of the sample. Five samples were used for \n\neach experiment and the average values were taken as the swelling percentage.  \n\nE. Mechanical Analysis \n\nE. 1. Tensile test \n\nThe stress-strain curve of developed chitosan fibers was recorded on a Universal \n\nMechanical Testing machine (Lyloyd Instruments, LR %K Serensworth Fareham, \n\nEngland) at room temperature and under room humidity. The measurements \n\nwere performed with a 500N load cell. The crosshead speed and the gauge \n\nlength were set to be 20mm/min and 20mm, respectively. Average values of \n\ntensile strength and maximum strain were determined after repeating the test for \n\nfive samples. \n\nE. 2. Dynamical Mechanical Analysis (DMA) \n\nDynamical Mechanical Analysis (DMA) provides information about the stiffness \n\nand damping properties of the materials. DMA is the most sensitive technique for \n\nmonitoring relaxation event as the mechanical properties change dramatically \n\nwhen relaxation behaviour is observed. \n\nIn the present thesis, this technique was used to analyze short-time swelling, \n\ncreep and rheological behaviour of chitosan fiber mesh scaffolds. All the \n\nexperiments were carried out while the samples were in an isotonic saline \n\nsolution in a DMA7e Perkin-Elmer apparatus, in compression mode, using \n\nparallel plates with 10mm diameter. The details for each kind of measurements \n\nare given in Chapter III. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 43\n\nIV. In Vitro Cytotoxicity and Cell Culture Studies \n\nA. Cell type \n\nA.1. Cell lines: Mouse lung fibroblast cell line (L929) and a human \nosteoblast-like cell line (SaoS-2) \n\nCell lines can be easily maintained in culture and employed in the experiments \n\nwhich are conducted outside of the living system or the host body. In the present \n\nstudies, mouse lung fibroblast cell line (L929) was selected for use in cytotoxicity \n\ntests. Cell culture studies on the developed scaffolds were performed by using a \n\nhuman osteoblast-like cell line (SaoS-2).   \n\nA. 2.  Rat Bone Marrow Stromal Cells (isolation) \n\nAlthough the cell lines are quite useful to test the tissue engineering scaffolds in \n\nvitro, they have major limitations for the use in vivo. The use of primary cells \n\nappears to be a more realistic approach for tissue engineering.  \n\nBased on this fact, rat bone marrow stromal cells were also used in some part of \n\nthe cell culture studies. Rat bone marrow stromal cells were isolated from 4 \n\nweeks-old male Wistar rats (Charles River, Spain). Surgical procedure was as \n\nfollows: The rats were euthanized by placing them in a plastic bag in CO2  \natmosphere. Their femurs and tibia were excised under aseptic conditions and \n\nwashed within ?-MEM (Eagle, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) containing 10 times more \n\namount of normal antibiotics concentrations. Soft tissues were removed from the \n\nbones and their epiphyses were cut off and the marrow residing in the midshaft \n\nwas flushed out with 5ml of complete medium (?-MEM containing 10% foetal \n\nbovine serum (FBS, Biochrome), 50 \u00b5g/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma), 50 \u00b5g/ml \n\ngentamycin, 1% antibiotics, 100mM ?-glycerolphosphate (Sigma) and 10-8 M \n\ndexamethasone (Sigma) using a syringe and collected in a 50 ml sterile \n\ncentrifuge tube. Then, the cells were put in a culture flask and cultured at 37\u00b0C in \n\na humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. These primary cultures were \n\nincubated for 2 days. After 2 days of incubation, hematopoietic and other \n\n\n\n 44\n\nunattached cells were removed from the flasks by repeated washes with PBS \n\nand the complete medium of the flasks was renewed every other day until \n\nreaching confluency.     \n\nB. Indirect Cytotoxicity Evaluation \n\nCytotoxicity test is a first step towards screening the biocompatibility of a \n\nbiomaterial. Indirect cytotoxicity tests are a rapid, standardized, sensitive, and \n\ninexpensive method to determine whether a material contains significant \n\nquantities of biologically harmful extracts. \n\nIn the present thesis, a mouse lung fibroblast cell line (L929) was used in \n\nthe cytotoxicity assessment to comply with the ISO/EN 10993-5 standard test \n\nmethod [11].  This standard test method is based on exposing the cells to the \n\nfluid extract of the test material and control materials. Ultra High Molecular \n\nWeight Polyethylene (UHMWPE) and latex rubber were used as negative and \n\npositive control, respectively. The extracts were obtained by placing the test and \n\ncontrol materials (n=3) in cell culture medium (2.5cm2/ml or 0.2/ml) for 24 hours \n\nat 37\u00b0C under constant agitation.  In the end, the extract fluids were filtered \n\n(45\u00b5m of pore size). Each fluid extract obtained were then applied to cultured-cell \n\nmonolayer, replacing the medium that had nourished the cells to that point, and \n\nincubated for 72h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% of CO2.  \nCells were then observed morphologically under a light microscope in response \n\nto the test and control materials\u2019 extraction fluids. A score for confluency of the \n\nmonolayer, degree of floating cells and change of cellular morphology was then \n\ncalculated based on the values given in Table 1.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 45\n\n \n\nCytotoxic Response Reactivity Pass/Fail \n\n0-1 None Pass \n\n1-3 Slight Pass \n\n3-5 Mild Retest \n\n5-7 Moderate Fail \n\n7-8 Severe Fail \n\nTable 2. Quantitative and qualitative scores used in the cytotoxicity tests. \n\n \n\n \n\nIn the end of the test, cells were trypsinized and the percentage of growth \n\ninhibition was determined through trypan blue exclusion test. The final cytotoxic \n\nindexes of the samples were then obtained by combining all the scores. The \n\nscores used in the test are given in Table 3.  \n\n \n\nTable 3.

Cell seeding and culture on the developed scaffolds  \n\nIn order for a scaffold to be considered successful, it should support to cells \n\nwhich are already seeded into the scaffolds prior the implantation, as well as the \n\ncells that might migrate into the scaffolds from the host.  \n\n To evaluate the cell supporting ability of the scaffolds developed in this \n\nthesis, a direct contact method was used. The parameters for the different \n\nscaffolds were given in Table 4. All the scaffolds were incubated with a culture \n\nmedium without serum overnight prior to cell seeding. The determined number of \n\ncells was suspended in a low amount of culture medium (50-300\u00b5l) and the \n\nsuspension was then dropped over the scaffolds carefully. After 1.5h incubation, \n\n1-3 ml (depending on the culture well used) of medium was added up to each \n\nwell. All the experiments were performed at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in humidified \n\natmosphere with medium changes every 2-3 days.  \n\n \n\nTable 4.

Characterization \n\nD. 1. Cell Morphology \n\nThe morphology of the cells cultured on the developed scaffolds were examined \n\nwith scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Leica Cambridge S360) at 15 V. After \n\neach time interval, cell/scaffold constructs were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde \n\nfor 30 min and washed excessively with PBS. They were then dehydrated \n\nthrough graded series of ethanol, dried and mounted onto brass stubs. Before \n\nthe analysis, all the samples were sputtered coated with gold.    \n\nD. 2. Cell viability and proliferation \n\nD. 2. 1. MTS \n\nMTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymetyhoxyphenyl)-2(4-sulfophenyl)-\n\n2H tetrazolium) is a substrate that is converted by NADPH or NADP produced by \n\ndehydrogenase enzymes in metabolically active cells to yield a brown formazan \n\nproduct . The intensity of the colour is directly related to the number of viable \n\ncells, and thus their proliferation in vitro. Cell viability on the scaffolds after \n\ndifferent time intervals was determined by using Cell Titer 96\u00ae Aqueous One \n\nSolution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega, USA). According to the standard \n\nprocedure, the triplicates of the samples were washed with sterile PBS and \n\nplaced in new culture wells. Fresh medium without phenol red and MTS reagent \n\nwere added to each well in 5/1 ratio. The reaction was carried out by incubating \n\nthe cell/scaffold constructs with this medium for 3h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified \n\natmosphere containing 5% of CO2.  In the end of the reaction, 100 \u00b5l of incubated \n\nmedium was transferred to 96-well plate and optical density was read at 490nm \n\nin a micro-plate reader (Synergy HT, Bio-tek). The results are expressed as the \n\naverage absorbance of triplicate samples.     \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 48\n\nD. 2. 2. DNA \n\nDNA assay is one of the most used measurements to evaluate cell proliferation \n\nby quantifying DNA content of cells cultured on the scaffolds. In order to \n\ndetermine the cell proliferation on wet-spun SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds, \n\nPicoGreen dsDNA kit (Molecular Probes, USA) was used. PicoGreen dsDNA \n\nQuantitation Reagent is an ultra-sensitive fluorescent nucleic acid stain for \n\nquantitative analysis of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in solution. \n\nFor the assay, the samples were prepared by rinsing with sterile PBS and \n\nincubated with sterile ultra pure water at 37\u00b0C for 1h. They were then frozen at -\n\n80\u00b0C and thawed.  Before starting the assay, they were sonicated 15min in an \n\nultrasonic bath. An aliquot of each sample was transferred to the 96-well plate. A \n\ncertain ratio of Tris-EDTA buffer and PicoGreen reagent prepared in the same \n\nbuffer was added to the each well. The fluorescence was read at 485nm and \n\n528nm excitation and emission, respectively. The DNA amount of each samples \n\nwas then calculated using a standard curve.  \n\nD. 3. ALP Enzyme Activity \n\nAlkaline phosphatase, an ectoenzyme produced by osteoblasts, is believed to \n\ninvolve in the degradation of inorganic pyrophosphate to provide a sufficient local \n\nconcentration of phosphate or inorganic pyrophosphate for mineralization to \n\nproceed. Among the various biological functions of osteoblasts, secretion of \n\nalkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an important indicator determining the activity of \n\nthe cells on a scaffold.  \n\nIn order to determine the extent of osteoblast phenotype expression, \n\namount of alkaline phosphatase produced by the cells were determined. ALP \n\nactivity of the cultured cells on the scaffolds was analyzed by either in weekly \n\ncollected supernatant (culture medium) of the samples or lysed cells. In both \n\nexperiments, the enzyme activity determination was based on the specific \n\nconversion of p-nytrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) into p-nytrophenol (pNP).   \n\n\n\n 49\n\nTo determine the activity of the secreted enzyme in the culture medium, \n\nsupernatants were collected at each time point and frozen at -80\u00b0C until further \n\nanalysis. For the assay, the collected supernatant were thawed and mixed with \n\nsubstrate solution (0.2% w/v p-nytrophenyl phosphate (pnPP) in 1M \n\ndiethanolamine HCl (pH=9.8)) at the ratio of 1/3. The enzyme reaction was \n\ncarried out by incubation of the mixture at 37\u00b0C for 1h and then stopped by \n\nadding a solution containing 2M NaOH and 0.2mM EDTA in distilled water. The \n\nfinal mixture was vortexed and dispensed in a 96 well-plate. The absorbance of \n\np-nytrophenol formed was measured at 405nm. A standard curve was made \n\nusing pNP values ranging from 0-600\u00b5mol/ml. The results were expressed in \n\n\u00b5mol of pNP produced/ml/h. \n\nThe ALP activity could also be measured in lysed cells. In this case, the \n\ndetermined enzyme is the one which is present in cells at the moment of the test. \n\nFor this assay, scaffolds seeded with cells were washed three times with PBS \n\nand transferred into an eppendorf containing ultra pure water.Then, the samples \n\nwere frozen and thawed, and sonicated for 15 min . The same reaction \n\nprocedure was followed. Briefly,  an aliquot of 50 \u00b5L of each sample was added \n\nto 150 \u00b5L of p-nitrophenyl phosphate solution at room temperature in the well of \n\na 96-well plate and incubated for 1h at 37 oC in the incubator. The absorbance of \n\np-nytrophenol reduced in the presence of alkaline phosphatase was measured at \n\n405nm. Calibration curve of p-nitrophenol at 37oC is used to determine the \n\nenzyme activity in units of \u00b5mol substrate converted to product per hour.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n 50\n\nReferences \n\n1.

Both structures were produced by means of a wet \n\nspinning technique. Maximum strain at break, and tensile strength of developed \n\nfibers were found to be 8.5%, 204.9 MPa, respectively. After 14 days of immersion in \n\nsimulated body fluid (SBF); scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive \n\nspectroscopy (EDS), and inductively-coupled plasma emission (ICP) spectroscopy \n\nanalyses showed that a bioactive Ca-P layer was formed on the surface of the fibers, \n\nmeaning that they exhibit a bioactive behaviour. The samples showed around 120% \n\nmax. swelling in physiological conditions.  \n\nThe pore sizes of 3-D chitosan fiber mesh scaffolds were observed to be in \n\nthe range of 100-500\u00b5m by SEM. The equilibrium-swelling ratio of the developed \n\nscaffolds was found to be around 170% (w/w) in NaCl solution at 37\u00b0C. Besides that, \n\nthe limit swelling strain was less than 30%, as obtained by mechanical spectroscopy \n\nmeasurements in the same conditions. The viscoelastic properties of the scaffolds \n\nwere also evaluated by both creep and dynamic mechanical tests.  \n\nBy means of using short-term MEM extraction test both types of structures \n\n(fibers and scaffolds) were found to be non-cytotoxic to fibroblasts. Furthermore, \n\nosteoblasts directly cultured over chitosan fiber mesh scaffolds presented good \n\nmorphology and no inhibition of cell proliferation could be observed.  \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n 54\n\n1. Introduction \n\nTissue engineering needs the development of better polymeric scaffolds, which \n\namong other characteristics should be biodegradable and biocompatible. The \n\nscaffolds can be applied simultaneously as a carrier matrix for bioactive agents and \n\nas a support to seed primary undifferentiated cells. A number of natural [1-3] and \n\nsynthetic polymers are currently in use as tissue scaffolds [4]. Depending on the \n\napplications, scaffolds can be presented in different forms, such as for instances \n\nmembranes, and several types of 3-D architectures. Within the last years, non-woven \n\nmesh-like scaffolds have been started to be used in tissue engineering applications \n\ndue to their highly porous structures. Polyglycolide (PGA) [5, 6], \n\npolylactide/polyglycolide (PLA/PGA) [7], and chitosan meshes [8] have been used as \n\na scaffold for different tissue engineering applications. \n\nChitosan, a (1?4)-2-amino-2-deoxy-?-D\u2013glucose, is derived from chitin, which \n\nis found in the exo-skeleton of shellfish like shrimp or crabs. Because of its stable, \n\ncrystalline structure, chitosan is normally insoluble in aqueous solutions above pH 7. \n\nHowever, in dilute acids, the free amino groups are protonated and the molecule \n\nbecomes fully soluble below pH 5 [3]. Viscous solutions can be formed into fibers in \n\ndifferent coagulation solution with high pH, such as aq. NaOH [9], aq. KOH [10], aq. \n\nNaOH-40% methanol [11], and aq. NaOH-NaSO4 (or AcONa) mixture [12]. Chitosan \n\nfiber forming properties have been investigated by several researchers [13]. A \n\nnumber of methods have been tried in order to produce chitosan fibers with good \n\nmechanical properties [10, 14, 15].   \n\nChitosan is a well known natural polymer that is biodegradable, biocompatible \n\nand nontoxic [16]. It has been shown [3, 17] to aggressively bind to a variety of \n\nmammalian and microbial cells. Binding on cells and biodegradability of chitosan may \n\nlead to a variety of biomedical applications such as wound dressing [18], carriers for \n\ndrug delivery systems [19, 20] and space filling implants [21, 22]. Recent studies of \n\nchitosan confirm the utility of chitosan for promoting the bone growth [23, 24]. \n\nMuzzarelli et al. [23] reported the formation of mineralized bone-like tissue in \n\nosseous defects in rats, sheep and dogs when using chitosan plugs. \n\nIn the present study, chitosan fibers were produced for being used \n\nsubsequently to process tissue engineering scaffolds. The developed scaffolds \n\n\n\n 55\n\nshould ideally combine an adequate porous structure with proper mechanical and \n\ndegradation properties. Furthermore, this study aimed for the analysis of this \n\nmaterials cytotoxicity as a first screening of its biocompatibility by means of using \n\nmouse fibroblast (L929) and human osteoblast (SaOs-2) cell lines. \n\n2. Experimental \n\n2.1. Materials \n\nMedium molecular weight chitosan with an 85% degree of deacetylation was \n\nobtained from Sigma-Aldrich. All other chemicals were analytical grade and used as \n\nreceived. \n\n2.2. Methods \n\n2.2.1. Chitosan fiber preparation \n\nChitosan fibers were produced by a wet spinning method as described elsewhere \n\n[12]. In a typical procedure; chitosan was dissolved in aq. 2% (v./v) acetic acid in 5% \n\n(w./v) concentration by stirring at room temperature overnight. The solution was \n\ndiluted with methanol to reach 3% (w./v) final solution concentration. Glycerol at 2.5% \n\nwt/wt concentration was added into this solution as a plasticizer. The solution was \n\nfiltered through a cloth filter and put in ultrasonic bath to remove the air bubbles. The \n\nsolution was injected into a coagulation bath at 40\u00b0C containing a mixture of 30% 0.5 \n\nM Na2SO4, 10% 1M NaOH and 60% distilled water. The fibers were kept in this \n\ncoagulation medium for one day and washed several times with distilled water. They \n\nwere then suspended in aq. 30% methanol for 4/5 h and then in aq. 50% methanol \n\novernight. The chitosan filaments were wounded on the cylindrical support. The \n\nfibers were dried at room temperature/humidity conditions for one day. \n\n \n\n\n\n 56\n\n2.2.2. Chitosan fiber meshes preparation \n\nA similar production method was used to produce 3-D chitosan fiber meshes. \n\nHowever, a different drying method and a thinner needle were used. After fibers were \n\nformed in coagulation medium at room temperature, they were kept in this solution \n\novernight. The fibers were then washed several times with distilled water before \n\nbeing suspended in 50% methanol for 1h. Then they were suspended 100% \n\nmethanol for 3h and put in the oven at 55\u00b0C for drying in a mould.  \n\n2.3. Characterization \n\n2.3.1. Chitosan fiber \n\nScanning Electron Microscopy \n\nThe morphology of fibers was visualized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) in \n\na Leica Cambridge S360 microscope. Samples were sputter coated with gold. \n\nMechanical Properties \n\nTensile tests were performed on a Universal Test Machine (Lyloyd Instruments, LR \n\n%K Serensworth Fareham, England), with a 500N load cell, using a cross-head \n\nspeed of 20mm/min and a gauge length 20mm. Average values of tensile strength \n\nand maximum strain were determined after repeating the test five times. \n\nSwelling Tests  \n\nSwelling behaviours of fibers have been investigated in 0.154M NaCl aqueous \n\nisotonic saline solution at pH=7.4. Fibers with different glycerol ratios were used, in \n\norder to observe the effect of glycerol on swelling ratio. The samples were immersed \n\nin the solution, taken out from it at various time intervals, and then weighted with an \n\nelectronic balance. The experiment was continued until samples reach the \n\nequilibrium. Swelling degree was calculated according to the following equation: \n\n \n\n%S = (mw \u2013 mi) / mi x 100 \n\n \n\n\n\n 57\n\nwhere %S is the percentage of swelling, mw is the weight of the wet sample after \n\nimmersion in the NaCl solution.  \n\nBioactivity Tests \n\nChitosan fibers were immersed in 15 ml simulated body fluid (SBF) in a plastic bottle \n\nat 37\u00b0C. SBF solution was proposed initially by Kokubo et al [25], present an ionic \n\ncomposition similar to human blood plasma, and has been widely used [26, 27] to \n\ntest the bioactivity of different materials in-vitro. After various periods of incubation (3, \n\n7, 14, 30 days) in SBF, samples were removed from the solution, washed carefully \n\nwith water and dried at room temperature in a desiccator. The apatite formation on \n\nthe fiber surface of a calcium-phosphate film was visualized by SEM (Leica \n\nCambridge S360). EDS spectra were obtained after the observation. Changes in \n\nconcentration of calcium and phosphorus of SBF solution due to soaking of fibers \n\nwere measured using inductively-coupled plasma emission (ICP) spectroscopy. \n\nCytotoxicity: Short Term MEM Extraction Test using Fibroblast Cells \n\nTo establish the cytotoxic rate of leachables, a MEM Extract test, a cytotoxicity test \n\nlaid down in European and International standards (ISO/EN 109935 Guidelines) was \n\nperformed [28]. For this assay, a cell line of mouse lung fibroblasts (L929) was \n\nselected. Growth to confluency was performed in controlled atmosphere (37\u00baC, 5% \n\nCO2, 100% humidity) using Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM, Sigma), \nsupplemented with 10% Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Biochrome) and 1% \n\nantibiotic/antimicotic solution (Sigma). In order to achieve 80% of confluency, cells \n\nseeded in cell culture polystyrene plates (10 000 cells/cm2) were incubated for 24h. \n\nAccording to ISO/EN 109935 Guidelines, surface area of the different samples was \n\ndetermined and immersion in the correspondent cell culture media volume was \n\nperformed (37\u00baC, 60 rpm). The same procedure was carried out for a negative \n\ncontrol Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE), and positive control \n\nLatex Rubber. After 24 hours, fibroblasts were morphologically analysed, and culture \n\nmedia was replaced by the extraction one. Test samples and controls were incubated \n\nin triplicate (n=3). After 24, 48 and 72 h testing, the reaction of cells to extracts was \n\nevaluated by means of light microscopy and compared to the positive control and \n\n\n\n 58\n\nnegative control. A score for confluency of monolayer, degree of floating cells and \n\nchanges in cellular morphology was calculated based on the scores posted on Table \n\n1. In the end of the test, cell number was measured and the percentage of cell \n\ngrowth inhibition determined. By means of combining the different quantitative and \n\nqualitative parameters scores, the obtained cytotoxic index defines if samples fail or \n\npass the cytotoxicity test (used scores can be seen in Table 2). \n\nTable 1.

Chitosan fiber meshes: \n\nScanning Electron Microscopy \n\nThe mesh structure of chitosan fibers was analysis by Scanning Electron Microscopy \n\n(Leica Cambridge S360) again after coating with gold. \n\nMechanical Properties \n\nShort-time swelling, creep and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) experiments \n\nwere carried out in a DMA7e Perkin-Elmer apparatus, in the compression mode, \n\nusing parallel plates with 10 mm diameter. The analysed samples, with cylindrical \n\nshape, were typically 2 mm high. All experiments were performed while the samples \n\nwere immersed in an isotonic saline solution. In order to implement such runs, a \n\nmetallic cylindrical vessel was fitted into the inner part of the furnace of the \n\napparatus. The vessel was filled with isotonic saline solution. The calibration of the \n\nforce was performed with the top plate immersed, in order to take into account the \n\nimpulsion effect of the solution. Before the runs have been carrying out on the \n\nsamples, the temperature of the bath was stabilised at 37 \u00baC, using the own \n\ntemperature sensor of the apparatus. \n\nThe short-time monitoring of the swelling of the studied mesh was carried out \n\nusing the thermal mechanical analysis (TMA) mode of the Perkin-Elmer dynamic \n\nmechanical analysis (DMA) apparatus. Briefly, the temperature of the dry sample is \n\nkept at 37 \u00baC in an external furnace, near the DMA equipment. The sample is quickly \n\npositioned between the plates and the furnace with the bath is immediately raised up. \n\nThe height of the sample starts to be recorded less than 10 seconds after the sample \n\ncontacts with the liquid. During the experiment a small stress of 10 Pa is imposed to \n\nthe sample by the top plate, in order to maintain the contact between the sample and \n\nthe plates. \n\nIn the creep experiments, previously swelled samples are positioned between the \n\nplates and immersed until the temperature equilibrates at 37\u00baC. The creep stress was \n\n0.1 MPa. A program of creep/recovery was used, where the strain, ?, was measured \n\nagainst time. \n\n\n\n 60\n\nDMA experiments were performed in the immersed samples (with equilibrated water \n\ncontent) at 37 \u00baC. The real (storage modulus), E\u2019, and the imaginary (loss modulus), \n\nE\u201d, of the complex modulus, E*=E\u2019+iE\u201d (with i=(-1)1/2), were recorded against \n\nfrequency, that varied between 0.5 and 10 Hz. A static stress of 36 kPa and a \n\ndynamic stress of 30 kPa were used in such experiments. \n\nSwelling Tests \n\nThe swelling ratios of the samples were calculated using the same experimental set-\n\nup and method that was described above. \n\nCytotoxicity and Biocompatibility: Direct Contact Test with Osteoblast-like Cells \n\nCytotoxicity assay was performed for chitosan fiber meshes by following the same \n\nmethodology as described for chitosan fibers in part 2.2.1. \n\nIn order to study cell morphology, attachment and proliferation onto the chitosan fiber \n\nmeshes scaffolds a human osteoblasts SaOs-2 cell line was selected. Former \n\ndescribed culture conditions were also used for osteoblast-like cells. Cells cultured in \n\nDME Media (Sigma), enriched with 10% FBS (Biochrome) and 1% \n\nantibiotic/antimicotic solution (Sigma) were seeded directly over samples in a \n\nconcentration of 3.3 x 104 cell/ml. Incubation was performed at 37 \u00baC (5% CO2, 100% \n\nhumidity) for 24 hours and 7 days. Tissue culture grade polystyrene (TCPS) discs \n\nwere used as control and replicates were always prepared. After each incubation \n\nperiod, samples were washed with Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS, Sigma) solution \n\nand fixed in gluteraldehyde 2.5% (v/v). For Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM) \n\nobservation, samples were previously dehydrated in crescent alcohol concentrations \n\n(50%, 70%, 90% and 100%), air-dried and sputter coated with gold. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 61\n\n3.

As it can be \n\nseen here in, chitosan fibers have been oriented in one direction due to the stretching \n\nprocess. Additionally, the images show that the fibers have a smooth and uniform \n\nstriated surface even though using drying elements and rolling up the fiber on \n\ncylindrical support following a methanol drying bath may damage a fiber surface. For \n\ninstance, Knaul et al.

In Figure 3.A it is possible \n\nto observe the typical oriented morphology of the fiber. Similar morphology was \n\nobserved in the first days of immersion in SBF. However, after 14 days of immersion, \n\na number of nucleus started to form on the surface of the fibers, that by EDS analysis \n\nwere found to correspond to the formation a calcium phosphate (Ca-P) (Data not \n\nshown). This nucleus have grown with increasing immersion times and after 30 days \n\na compact and well-defined Ca-P layer could be observed, as presented in Figures \n\n3.B and 3.C For higher magnifications (Figure 3.C) this layer tended to the typical so-\n\ncalled cauliflower like morphology of Ca-P films.  \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n 63\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \nFigure 3.

Chitosan fiber meshes  \n\nScanning Electron Microscopy \n\nSEM images of fiber meshes are presented in Figure 7.A, B, C. As it can be seen in \n\nthe micrograhps, the chitosan fibers could be formed into mesh structures having an \n\naverage pore size in range of 100-500 \u00b5m. In addition, it was possible to see that \n\nfibers have sticked to each other. This structure gives them good mechanical \n\nstrength as well as it will enable cell ingrowth, as required for tissue engineering \n\nscaffolding applications. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSample Total Cytotoxic \nResponse \n\nReactivity Pass/Fail \n\nChitosan fiber 0 None Pass \n\nChitosan fiber \nmesh scaffolds \n\n0 None Pass \n\nUHMWPE 0 None Pass \n\nTCPS 0 None Pass \n\nLatex 8 Severe Fail \n\n\n\n 66\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 7 \u2013 SEM micrographs of the structure of the developed chitosan fibers \nmeshes; A) x33.4, B) x50, C) x250 \n\nMechanical Properties \n\nSwelling experiments are usually carried out by means of measuring the sample\u2019s \n\nweight after different periods of immersion. It is then very difficult to access the \n\nswelling data during short-time immersion periods, which would be rather relevant for \n\nmaterials having a fast swelling rate. The studied chitosan meshes are among such \n\nsystems, where the equilibration of water content occurs mostly in the first hour after \n\nimmersion. The innovative procedure described here in permits to follow this process \n\nby continuously monitoring the height of the samples immediately after the moment \n\nthey are immersed. Obviously, considering an isotropic swelling, the height of the \n\nsample is easily correlated with the increase of volume \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA B \n\nC \n\n\n\n 67\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8 \u2013 Evolution of the strain of a dry chitosan mesh after it was immersed at 37 \n\u00baC (symbols). The solid line corresponds to the best fit of the data according to Eq. \n(2). \n \n\nThe sample\u2019s strain (?=(h-h0)/h0, where h and h0 are the measured and initial \n\nheights of the sample) is measured against time. The results obtained with an initially \n\ndry sample with h0=2.351 mm are shown in Figure 8. The increase of the strain is \n\nfaster in the first 20 minutes and the limit strain seems to be less than 30%. \n\nThe data in Figure 8 was fitted according to the stretched exponential function: \n\n \n\n[ ]))/(exp(1)( ?? ????=? tt  \n \n\nwhere ?? is the limit swelling strain, ? is a characteristic swelling time and ? is an \n\nexponent parameter that measures the deviation from a first-order swelling kinetics \n\n(?=1). This function appears in this context as an empirical model that may be useful \n\nto characterise the strain at equilibrium and the swelling rate. This equation has been \n\noften used to follow relaxational processes, i.e., the isothermal evolution to the \n\nequilibrium when a system is subjected to an external perturbation (see, for example, \n\nref. [29]); in that case the model has physical significance. The results in Figure 8 \n\nwere fitted using a Levenberg-Marquard algorithm and the adjusted parameters \n\nwere: ??= 29,4\u00b10.08%, ?= 9.8\u00b10.1 min and ?=0.54\u00b10.003. \n\n\n\n 68\n\nThe meshes may be subjected to static loads if used in different biomedical \n\napplications. In polymer-based materials an applied static stress usually results in a \n\ncontinuous, long term deformation under the applied stress, called creep. Such \n\nphenomenon may be relevant in the clinical use of the studied meshes, being \n\nassociated with changes on the mechanical performance of the material and in \n\nvariations in the dimensions of the implant. In this work creep/recovery of the \n\nimmersed chitosan mesh was studied in simulated in-vitro conditions. \n\nThe \u201cinstantaneous\u201d increase of the strain is mainly associated with the expulsion of \n\nwater within the mesh and thus is weakly assigned with the changes of geometry of \n\nthe chitosan fibres, but rather is to the quantity of water initially in equilibrium and to \n\nthe original cellular geometry of the sample. Please note that the initial strain value \n\n(?35%) is higher than the plateau in the swelling experiments (?30%, as suggested \n\nby Figure 8). The excess strain (?5%) is then basically due to the deformation of the \n\nmesh geometry of the chitosan sample. \n\nAfter the initial deformation a clear delayed response is observed in the creep \n\nexperiment (see inset graphics in Figure 9). The approximately linear relationship \n\nfound in the log time graphics may be in accordance with the power-law for the time \n\ndependence found in the viscoelastic creep response found in another system [30]. \n\nTherefore, it is possible to assign this delayed creep to the viscoelastic properties of \n\nthe chitosan fibres. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 9 \u2013 Creep (60 min) followed by a recovery stage (60 min) and, finally, a \nsecond short creep run performed at 37 \u00baC in the immersed chitosan mesh. The inset \ngraphics shows the viscoelastic component of the first creep run, in a log time scale. \n\n\n\n 69\n\nThe removing of the strain results in a quick decrease of strain that occurs \n\nwith a similar time-scale of the swelling experiment (? ? 10 min). Therefore, most of \n\nthe strain recovery is related with the swelling of the mesh. After 1 h of recovery, it is \n\nfound that the strain is far to converge to 0. This may be an indication that part of the \n\nmesh structure was irreversibly transformed during the creep state, leading to a more \n\ncompact cellular arrangement. \n\nAfter this creep/recovery experiment the sample was again subjected to the \n\nsame creep stress. The strain appears to respond similarly to the first creep \n\nexposition, being an indication that neither apparent complex memory effects nor \n\ndrastic structural occurs in the sample. \n\n The rheological behaviour of the immersed mesh was also characterised by \n\nDMA. Both storage and loss moduli (E\u2019 and E\u201d) were measured at 37 \u00baC in the \n\nfrequency range 0.5-10 Hz, which are typical frequencies found in physiological \n\nstress-variation situations (blood pumping rate, masticatory frequency, time for \n\npatient movements\u2026). The results are shown in Figure 10. It is to be noticed that the \n\nvalues may change if the experiment is carried out at different stresses, due to the \n\nvariation of the water content in equilibrium inside the mesh. Please also note that E\u2019 \n\nand E\u201d may be transformed into other viscoelastic parameters [31], such as \n\ncompliance, D*=D\u2019-iD\u201d=1/E*, shear complex modulus, G*=G\u2019+iG\u201d==E*/[2(1+?*)], \n\nwhere ?* is the complex Poisson\u2019s ratio, shear compliance, J*=J\u2019-iJ\u201d=1/G*, or the real \n\nand imaginary components of the dynamic viscosity, ?\u2019=G\u201d/? and  ?\u201d=G\u2019/?. \n\nThe storage modulus increases with increasing frequency, being E\u2019 typically \n\nabove 1 MPa. The loss modulus shows the inverse tendency. This results in a \n\ndecrease of the loss factor, tan ?=E\u201d/E\u2019 with increasing frequency (inset graphics in \n\nFigure 10). This parameter measures the fraction of the imposed mechanical stress \n\nthat is dissipated in the form of heat. As tan ? is typically above 0.15 for f<1 Hz, one \n\nmay conclude that the damping capability of the system is significant, which may be \n\nimportant for some biomedical application that require dissipation of mechanical \n\nenergy. It was found that living cells behaves as soft glassy materials existing close \n\nto a glass transition, implying that cytoskeletal proteins may regulate cell mechanical \n\nproperties [32]. This kind of evidences leads one to speculate on the existence of \n\nsome advantages upon biological functions when the materials of the implant that will \n\n\n\n 70\n\nbe in contact with living tissues, also present a viscoelastic character, as is the case \n\nfor the studied chitosan mesh. \n\n \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 10 \u2013 Storage and loss moduli (E\u2019 and E\u201d) as a function of frequency (f) at 37 \n\u00baC of the immersed chitosan mesh.

In this \n\nfigure, it is possible to observe the typical swelling behaviour of chitosan scaffolds [7]. \n\nSamples reach the equilibrium water uptake ratio, which is around 170% (w/w), after \n\n\n\n 71\n\nabout 3h in NaCl solution. Although fiber meshes were swelled up to high ratio, they \n\npreserved their physical integrity upon incubation in aqueous solution. This property \n\nof chitosan fiber meshes may enable for easy handling of the scaffold material in \n\npractical clinical applications. This result has been confirmed by DMA tests. \n\nCytotoxicity and Biocompatibility: Direct Contact Test with Osteoblast-like Cells \n\nCytotoxicity test results for chitosan fiber mesh scaffolds can be seen in Table 3. \n\nThey showed no cytotoxic effect, and behaviour very similar to tissue culture and \n\nUHMWPE surfaces \n\nIn order to observe cell morphology and proliferation of an osteoblast cell line \n\nover chitosan fiber mesh scaffold surfaces SaOs-2 cells were directly cultured and \n\nincubated for 1 and 7 days. By means of observing Figures 12.A and B it is possible \n\nto verify that scaffolds allowed for very significant cell proliferation from day 1 to day \n\n7, respectively. After 7 days, it was clearly seen that cells have been attaching to the \n\nscaffolds and bridging each other by means of filapodia structures which is typical for \n\nosteoblast-like cells (Figure 13) [33]. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of osteoblastic-\n\nlike cells morphology confirmed short-term cytotoxic results performed with \n\nfibroblasts, and allowed for observing extensive lamellipodium structure formation. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 12 \u2013 Osteoblast-like cells A)adhering to chitosan based fibres after 1 day of \nculture, B) proliferating over chitosan based fibres after 7 days of culture. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA B \n\n\n\n 72\n\n4. Conclusions \n\nIn this paper attention has been focused on the preparation and properties of \n\nchitosan fiber and fiber meshes for potential use in tissue engineering applications. In \n\nthe present study, chitosan fibers could be produced by a wet spinning technique. A \n\nsubsequent drying treatment with methanol was used to improve the mechanical \n\nstrength of fibers. Mechanical tests showed that the fibers had enough tensile \n\nstrength to be used to produce scaffolds with good mechanical performance. \n\nUnexpectedly, the developed fibers showed a bioactive behaviour, which is also very \n\nimportant for biomaterials aimed to be used for instances in bone tissue engineering \n\nscaffolding. Fibers could also be formed into 3D structure aimed to be used as tissue \n\nengineering scaffolds. One could observe that mesh structure of the scaffold was \n\nsuitable for cell ingrowth. This was confirmed by the results obtained on the in-vitro \n\ncell culture studies. Both types of samples extracts were comparable to UHMWPE \n\nclearly passing the test. In addition, osteoblasts growing over scaffold surfaces \n\npresented adequate morphology and good proliferation, proofing that the developed \n\nscaffolds might be used for bone tissue engineering applications.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 73\n\nReferences \n\n1.

Introduction \n\nThe new and rapidly developing tissue engineering field is requiring novel \n\nprocessing methods and designs of scaffold and membranes for guided tissue \n\nregeneration. The scaffolds have been fabricated using conventional techniques \n\nsuch as fiber bonding, solvent casting, particulate leaching, membrane \n\nlamination and melt molding [1-4]. The disadvantage of the above technologies \n\nincludes the intensive fabrication process, the limitation to thin structures, and \n\nresidual particles in the polymer matrix, irregularly shaped pores, and \n\ninsufficient interconnectivity. Recently, rapid protyping technologies such as \n\nfused deposition modelling, laminated object manufacturing, three dimensional \n\nprinting and 3D plotting have also been applied to process biodegradable and \n\nbioresorbable materials with controllable and reproducible porosity and well-\n\ndefined 3D microstructures  [5-8].  \n\nMarine skelatal material is usually made of CaCO3 in the crystalline form \n\nof calcite and aragonite and silicated SiO2 materials combined with Mg(OH)2. \n\nOrganisms from different species of corals and hydrocorals have a wide variety \n\nof skeletal architectures and crystalline structures [9]. Coralline carbonate \n\nderivatives, mostly coralline hydroxyapatite, are currently being used mostly as \n\nbone filler or nonweight-bearing areas and orbital implants [10].  The internal \n\nstructure of some coral species is very similar to porous structure of bone and \n\nreplica of porous calcium carbonate can be converted to highly biocompatible \n\nand osteogenic tricalcium phoshate and/or hydroyapatite by a hydrothermal \n\nprocess  [11, 12]. \n\nChitin and chitosan are biologically renewable, biodegradable, \n\nbiocompatible, non-toxic and biofunctional [13]. The use of chitosan together \n\nwith bioceramics such as calcium phosphate as a scaffold material for tissue \n\nengineering applications has been reported previously by a number of \n\nresearchers [14-16]. The incorporation of bioceramics has been shown to \n\nincrease osteoconductivity and improved mechanical strength greatly  [17, 18]. \n\nChitosan fibers, which can be easily extended into three-dimensional \n\nstructures of woven, knitted and nonwoven are widely used in a variety of \n\nbiomedical applications, including sutures, wound dressing, and artificial hair \n\n[19, 20]. This interest is mainly derived from the fact that chitosan is a natural \n\n\n\n  79\n\npolymer that shows well-known wound acceleration ability and a biological \n\naptitude to stimulate cell proliferation. Depending on the processing conditions, \n\nchitosan fibers can present good mechanical properties. Several authors have \n\ndescribed the improving the mechanical strength of fibers from chitosan [21-23]. \n\nAdequate mechanical properties can make chitosan based materials adequate \n\nfor the developing of tissue engineering scaffolds that can be used for bone or \n\ncartilage regeneration.   \n\nThe aim this study is the development of a composite material from \n\ncoralline origin hydroxyapatite (HA) particles and chitosan fibers for use in \n\ntissue engineering or in guided tissue regeneration. By orienting the cylindrical \n\ncoral particles (microchannels run parallel along the particle length) in one \n\ndirection, an anisotropic material similar to biologic structure of bone can be \n\nproduced. The bone forming cells osteocytes are known to be arranged in \n\nconcentric layers called lamellae. In turn, lamellae surrounds central \n\nmicroscopic channels known as haversian canals, through which run capillaries \n\nand nerves. Haversian canals and surrounding lamellar structure are oriented \n\nparallel to bone structure. It is believed that a scaffold structure mimicking these \n\narrangements can provide a guided bone ingrowth and correct vascularization \n\nof biomaterial inside the body. \n\nSince coralline origin HA granules are prone to damage from mechanical \n\nstirring or harsh handling procedure, a new processing method was suggested \n\nin order to blend cylinder shaped coralline HA particles with chitosan fibers. In \n\nthis method, semi-cylinder parallel channels (1 mm in width and deep) were \n\nprepared in a mould for holding and orienting the particles in one direction. This \n\ncomposite material was reinforced with chitosan fibers along and right angle to \n\nchannels and finally, a membrane was used to cover the material in the mould. \n\nAfter obtaining a replica of mould channels over the membrane, thicker \n\nscaffolds can be produced by physical clamp fixing of subsequent replicas of \n\ncoralline HA to each other. \n\n2. Materials&amp;Methods \n\nChitosan (deacetylation degree 87 %), acetic acid, and sodium hydroxide were \n\nobtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, USA). Methanol was obtained \n\n\n\n  80\n\nfrom Merck Chemical Co. (Germany). Sodium sulphate was obtained from \n\nAldrich Chemical Co. All the other chemicals used were of analytical grade. \n\n2.1. Preparation of coralline origin HA reinforced composite material \n\n2.1. 1. Chitosan fiber preparation  \n\nChitosan fibers were produced as previously reported [24]. In brief, chitosan \n\nwas dissolved in aq. 2 % (v/v) acetic acid solution in 5 % (w/v) concentration by \n\nstirring magnetically at room temperature overnight. Methanol was added to \n\ndilute the viscous solution for easy injection until reaching 3 % (w/v) final \n\nconcentration. Glycerol was used as a plasticizer (2.5 % (w/w)). After filtration \n\nwith a cloth filter, solution was placed in an ultrasonic bath to remove the air \n\nbubbles. The solution was allowed to remain at room temperature overnight for \n\naging. The clear solution was injected into a coagulation bath at 40 \u00b0C, (30 % \n\n1N Na2SO4, 10 % 1N NaOH and 60 % distilled water). The formed fibers were \n\nkept in this coagulation medium for one day and then washed several times with \n\ndistilled water. They were suspended in aqueous 30 % methanol for 4-5 h and \n\nthen in aqueous 50 % methanol overnight. The chitosan filaments were wound \n\non the cylindrical support and the fibers were dried at room for one day.  \n\n2.1.2. Chitosan membrane preparation \n\nChitosan membranes were made by a simple solvent casting technique. The \n\nchitosan was dissolved in aqueous acetic acid solution (1 % (w/v)), and then \n\nwas casted onto a plastic petri dishes in a ratio of 0.25g/cm2. Membranes were \n\nthen allowed to dry slowly in an incubator at 37 \u00b0C for 3 days.  \n\n2.1.3. Assembly of coralline origin HA granules, chitosan fibers, and \nmembrane \n\nA chitosan-coralline origin HA slurry was obtained by careful mixing chitosan \n\nsolution (3 %, (w/v)) with prewetted HA microgranules in 1/1 ratio (w/w). The \n\nslurry was then placed into channel spaces by means of a gentle smear \n\nprocess (Figure 1). \n\n \n\n\n\n  81\n\nTCP/HA \nparticles \n\nchitosan \nfibers \n\nmold \n\nOver the coralline origin HA filled spaces, chitosan fibers were aligned as one \n\nset parallel and another set right angle to channel direction to produce a chess \n\nlike pattern (Figure 2). Finally, a chitosan membrane was placed over the \n\ncoralline origin HA particles and the fiber network. In order to provide good \n\nadhesion between membrane and wet particles, a weight was applied over the \n\nmembrane and let to act overnight. The assembly with the mould was placed to \n\nan oven at 37 oC to dry the material. Special care was given to peel off the \n\ncomposite material from the mould. Released material was stored in desicator \n\nuntil further assembly. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.

Cell culture \n\nA cell line of mouse long fibroblasts (L929) was selected for all cytotoxicity \n\nassays. Cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified eagle medium (DMEM, \n\nSigma), supplemented with 10 % of Foetal Bovine Serum (Biochrome) and 1 % \n\nof antibiotics/antimicotics solution (Sigma) until they reach confluency. Twenty-\n\nfour hours before the cytotoxicity tests start, cells were trypsinized and seeded \n\n(n= 3 per tested condition) on 24 and 96 well plates using a density of 7x104 \n\ncells/cm2. \n\n2.2.2. MEM extraction test (72 hours) \n\nThe materials (n= 3) were incubated in 10 ml of complete culture medium (2.5 \n\ncm2/ml) (1) for 24 hours at 37 \u00baC under constant agitation. In the end of the 24 \n\nhours the extraction fluids were filtered (45 \u00b5m of pore size). \n\nMorphological evaluation \n\nFor morphological evaluation, culture medium present in the 24 well plates was \n\nreplaced by 2 ml of extraction fluid and incubated for 72 hours at 37 \u00baC in a \n\nhumidified atmosphere containing 5 % of CO2. After 72 hours the reaction of the \n\ncells to the extracts was evaluated by means of light microscopy and compared \n\nto the negative control (cells incubated with standard culture medium) and \n\npositive control (latex rubber). A score for confluency of the monolayer, degree \n\nof floating cells and change of cellular morphology was then calculated based \n\non the values posted on Table 1. Cells were also trypsinized, the percentage of \n\ngrowth inhibition was determined through trypan blue exclusion test and a score \n\nwas obtained after correction for the value of positive and negative controls. \n\nThe scores were then combined (four parameters have equal weight) resulting \n\nin a final cytotoxic response index ranging from 0 to 8 (Table 2). \n\n\n\n  83\n\nScore \nConfluency  \n\n(%) \n\nFloating cells \n\n(%) \n\nChange of cellular \nmorphology \n\nInhibition of cell \ngrowth \n\n (%) \n\n0 100 0 No changes during test period 0-10 \n\n1 90-100 0-5 Slight changes, few cells affected 10-30 \n\n2 60-90 5-10 \nMild changes, some \ncells round/spindle \n\nshaped \n30-50 \n\n3 30-60 10-20 \nModerate changes, \n\nmany cells \nround/spindle \n\n50-70 \n\n4 0-30 > 20 \n\nSevere changes, \nabout all cells show \n\nmorphological \nchanges \n\n70-100 \n\n \n\nTable 1.

After 72 hours cell viability was assessed by using Cell \n\nTiter 96\u00ae One solution Cell proliferation Assay kit (Promega, USA). This test is \n\nbased on the bioreduction of the substrate, (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-\n\ncarboxymethoxyphenyl)-2(4-sulfophenyl)-2H tetrazolium) (MTS), into a brown \n\nformazan product by NADPH or NADP produced by dehydrogenase enzymes in \n\nCytotoxic Response Reactivity Pass/Fail \n\n0-1 None Pass \n\n1-3 Slight Pass \n\n3-5 Mild Retest \n\n5-7 Moderate Fail \n\n7-8 Severe Fail \n\n\n\n  84\n\nmetabolically active cells  [26, 27]. For the assay to occur extraction fluids were \n\nremoved and 100 \u00b5l of a mixture of culture medium without FBS and MTS in 5:1 \n\nratio were added into each well. Cells were then incubated for three hours at 37 \n\n\u00baC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % of CO2, in the end of which \n\noptical density was read at 490 nm in a plate reader (Molecular Devices, USA). \n\nResults are plotted as percentage of negative control. \n\n2.3. Swelling test \n\nIn order to test the swelling behaviour, the scaffold was cut into five small \n\npieces and each piece was immersed in 0.154 M NaCl aqueous isotonic saline \n\nsolution (pH 7.4).  The samples were taken out from solution at various time \n\nintervals being weighted with an analytical balance. The experiment was \n\ncontinued until reaching of an equilibrium value. \n\n The swelling ratio of the samples was calculated according to the \n\nfollowing equation: \n\n \n\n% S = (mw \u2013 mi) / mi  x 100   (1) \n\n \n\nwhere % S is the percentage of swelling, mw is the weight of the wet sample \n\nafter immersion in the NaCl solution. Average values were used to determine \n\nthe swelling ratio of scaffold for each of the time points. \n\n3. Results and discussion \n\n3.1. Coralline origin HA/chitosan composite material preparation \n\nLight transmission microscopy analysis of the composite material showed that \n\nmost of coralline origin HA cylinder bodies were aligned along channel direction. \n\nChitosan microfibers are seen to be running along coralline origin HA granules \n\nand making chess structure between coralline origin HA replica and chitosan \n\nmembrane (Figure 2.B). Chitosan membrane was observed to hold both \n\ngranules and fibers securely. The strength of composite materials can be \n\nincreased greatly with the incorporation of fibers. In this respect, the coralline \n\norigin HA filled channels were supported by parallel chitosan fibers. A chess-like \n\n\n\n  85\n\nstructure was produced, so that the load can be distributed evenly over the \n\ncomplex. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Light transmission microphotographs of HA granules (white cylinder \nbodies) and chitosan fibers (indicated by arrows) over chitosan membrane:  \n(A) Front view of complex and (B) back view of complex. \n\nThe parallel distribution of coralline origin HA particles is especially \n\nimportant because, fine microchannel architecture of cylindrical structures align \n\nin longitudinal direction of ceramic structure. By that way, highly oriented \n\nchannel networks can be created through the composite material. This pattern \n\nwould mimic the haversian network of natural bone and as a result, a correct \n\nremodelling of biomaterial by infiltration of bone tissue and extensive \n\nvascularization at implantation site can be expected. This will be analysed in \n\nfuture in-vivo studies. \n\n3.2. Cytotoxicity assays \n\nWith regard to short-term MEM extract test there was no cell growth inhibition \n\ndetected after the trypan blue exclusion test (0.00 + 0.00). Moreover cells \n\nrevealed similar morphologies and proliferation patterns when compared with \n\nthe negative control, obtaining a score of 1 in the cytotoxicity index (Table 2) \n\nshowing in this sense that these materials were non-toxic. This type of result is \n\nnot typical at all for biodegradable polymers.  \n\nRegarding cell viability assay (MTS test), cells produced large amounts \n\nof the brown formazan product, which indicates a normal metabolism (Figure 3). \n\nL929 cells incubated with composite extracts showed a good incorporation and \n\n1 mm 1 mm \n\nA B \n\n\n\n  86\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nCHI/TCP Positive control\n\n%\n n\n\neg\nat\n\niv\ne \n\nco\nnt\n\nro\nl\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n0 50 100 150 200\n\ntime (min.)\n\nsw\nel\n\nlin\ng \n\nra\ntio\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\n \n\nmetabolization of MTS, displaying only a slight inhibition of the metabolism \n\nwhen compared to negative control.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.

Swelling curve of coralline HA-chitosan composite in physiological \nsaline (pH 7.4). \n\n\n\n  87\n\nFigure 4 shows that the composite material was swelled up to 88 % and no \n\nfurther swelling was observed afterwards. Upon long-term incubation of scaffold \n\nmaterial in a physiological saline solution, no physical alteration or deformation \n\nin coralline origin HA replica or fiber alignment was detected. Chitosan material \n\nis known to swell in aqueous solutions and sometimes this property can be \n\nused to secure biomaterial inside the implantation space [28], taking advantage \n\nof a press\u2013fitting mechanism. The developed composite materials maintain their \n\nintegrity when immersed in physiological media, even though they showed a \n\nbrief swelling. Consequently, it can be expected that in implantation site it will \n\nshow no further change in structure due to swelling. \n\n4. Conclusions \n\nA 3D composite of coralline origin HA microgranules was obtained by using a \n\nmultichannel mould processing and chitosan as reinforcing material. The \n\ncomposite material showed parallel orientation of cylindrical coralline origin HA \n\nbodies along channel direction and good adhesion of particles to chitosan fibers \n\nand the outer chitosan membrane. MEM extraction test indicated no cell growth \n\ninhibition as determined by the trypan blue exclusion method. MTS test with the \n\ncomposite showed more than 90 % cell viability compare to negative controls. \n\nThe cytotoxicity assays confirmed that the composite material is non-toxic. The \n\nswelling test in physiological medium indicated 88 % (w/w) swelling in one hour \n\nand afterwards no further change was observed.

Chitosan fiber mesh scaffolds produced by a previously described \n\nwet spinning methodology were initially wet with a Bioglass\u00ae-water suspension \n\nby means of a spraying methodology and then immersed in a simulated body \n\nfluid (SBF) mimicking physiological conditions for one week. The formation of \n\napatite layer was observed morphologically by scanning electron microscopy \n\n(SEM). As a result of the use of the novel spraying methodology, a fine coating \n\ncould also be observed penetrating into the pores, that is clearly within the bulk \n\nof the scaffolds. Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR), Electron \n\nDispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis also \n\nconfirmed the presence of apatite-like layer. A human osteoblast-like cell line \n\n(SaOs-2) was used for the direct cell contact assays. After two weeks of culture, \n\nsamples were observed under the SEM. When compared to the control samples \n\n(unmodified chitosan fiber mesh scaffolds) the cell population was found to be \n\nhigher in the Ca-P biomimetic coated scaffolds, which indicates that the levels of \n\ncell proliferation on this kind of scaffolds could be enhanced. Furthermore, it was \n\nalso observed that the cells seeded in the Ca-P coated scaffolds have a more \n\nspread and flat morphology, which reveals an improvement on the cell adhesion \n\npatterns, phenomena that are always important in processes such as \n\nosteoconduction. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 93\n\n1. Introduction \n\nBone is a complex, dynamic and highly vascular tissue with a large amount of \n\nextracellular matrix. In nanoscale, bone matrix consists of highly organized \n\ncollagen fibers surrounded by apatite crystals [1]. Due to this very specialized \n\nstructure, repair or replacement of damaged or traumatized bone still remains as \n\na serious problem in surgery. For many years, autografts and allografts have \n\nbeen used for bone repair. However, there are many limitations and \n\ncomplications in the use of autogratfs and allografts, including limited supply, \n\ndonor site morbidity and transfer of diseases.      \n\nEngineering of bone tissue is a new approach to recreate complexity, \n\nstability, and biologic function of bone tissue. The most common strategy for the \n\ntissue engineering of bone is to use a scaffold combined with osteoblast or the \n\ncells that can mature/differentiate into osteoblasts and regulating factors that \n\npromote cell attachment, differentiation and mineralized bone formation [2]. To \n\nserve as a scaffold for bone tissue engineering, the material should be \n\nbiocompatible, biodegradable, and porous with an interconnective pore structure \n\nin order to allow nutrients and metabolites to permeate. Furthermore, it must also \n\nbe osteoconductive, so that osteoblasts and osteoprogenitor cells can attach and \n\nmigrate in the scaffold.    \n\nCalcium phosphate ceramics and bioactive glasses have been proposed \n\nto be used as a scaffold for bone tissue engineering due to their excellent \n\nosteoconductivity [3, 4]. It has been shown that they can bind to bone trough an \n\napatite layer at the interface or bind directly to bone [5]. However, they can not \n\nserve alone as a scaffold because of their brittleness and low resistance against \n\nimpact loading.  \n\nBiodegradable polymers have been proposed as possible alternatives and \n\nreceived much attention as bone replacement materials [6-8]. They can be easily \n\nprocessed into 3-D porous structures with a proper degradation rate and \n\nmechanical strength. However, most of them are not show bioactivity without any \n\nsurface modification. To overcome this problem, the surface of the material can \n\nbe coated with HA or apatite. A number of methods, such as plasma spraying [9], \n\n\n\n 94\n\nion sputtering [10], laser deposition [11], sol-gel deposition [12], dip coating \n\nsintering [13], have been used for apatite coating of the material surfaces. \n\nHowever, these processes need very high temperatures or very high/low pH that \n\ncan not be applied to the polymeric materials. In addition, the apatite formed by \n\nthese processes is usually highly crystalline and has different crystal structure \n\nthan that in natural bone apatite. Another drawback in these processes is the \n\ndifficulties in obtaining a homogenous and a thin layer of coating on the surface \n\nof the material.  \n\nBiomimetic coating using simulated body fluid (SBF) has been developed \n\nby Kokubo and co-workers as an alternative to the methods discussed above \n\n[14]. They have reported that the formed apatite, so-called bone-like apatite, is \n\nmore similar to natural bone with a low crystallinity and nano-cyrstal size which is \n\nalso an important issue in its degradation. Moreover, the conditions that are used \n\nin this process are very mild and allow applying a variety of polymeric and non-\n\npolymeric surfaces [15, 16]. For instance, Reis et al. [17-19] adapted and used \n\nthis methodology for starch-based biodegradable polymers. Regarding the \n\nmechanism, it has been shown that the functional groups on the polymer surface, \n\nsuch as Si-OH, Ti-OH and carboxyl or carboxylate, are the responsible for the \n\napatite nucleation in SBF. Once the material with a functional surface immersed \n\nin SBF, which is already supersaturated with ions that constitute apatite, apatite \n\nnuclei starts to form and grow into a dense and uniform bone-like apatite layer \n\n[15]. One way to introduce functional Si-OH group on the polymeric surfaces is to \n\nface the polymer with Bioglass\u00ae particles before immersion in SBF [20].  \n\nThe objective of the present study is to obtain bone-like apatite layer on chitosan \n\nfiber mesh scaffolds by using the biomimetic approach.  We developed a new \n\nmethodology based on a simple spraying process in order to have a \n\nhomogeneous coating on these complex structures. Moreover, we also tested \n\nthe scaffolds with human osteoblast-like cell line (SaOs-2) to determine the \n\ninfluence of bone-like apatite coating on cell adhesion and viability.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 95\n\n2. Materials&amp;Methods \n\nChitosan (deacetylation degree 87 %), was obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co.  \n\nBioglass\u00ae with particle size of 5\u00b5m was kindly supplied by US Biomaterials Corp. \n\n(Florida, USA). All the other chemicals used were of analytical grade.  \n\n2.1. Production of Chitosan Fiber Mesh Scaffolds \n\nChitosan fibers were produced as previously reported [21]. In brief, chitosan was \n\ndissolved in aq. 2% (v/v) acetic acid solution in 5% (w/v) concentration at room \n\ntemperature overnight. Methanol was added to dilute the viscous solution for \n\neasy injection until reaching 3% (w/v) final concentration. Glycerol was used as a \n\nplasticizer (2.5% (w/w)). After filtration with a cloth filter, the solution was placed \n\nin an ultrasonic bath to remove the air bubbles. The clear solution was injected \n\ninto a coagulation bath (30% 1N Na2SO4, 10% 1N NaOH and distilled water). \n\nThe formed fibers were kept in this coagulation medium for one day and then \n\nwashed several times with distilled water. They were then suspended in an \n\naqueous 50% methanol solution for 1h and subsequently in 100% methanol for \n\n3h. The fibers were then put in a plastic cylindrical mould and dried at 60\u00b0C \n\novernight.  \n\n2.2. Biomimetic Coating \n\nA simple methodology was developed for the biomimetic coating experiments. \n\nThe method is basically based on spraying a Bioglass\u00ae/water suspension on the \n\nsurface of the scaffolds. This spraying methodology allows for the coating of the \n\nbulk of the scaffold. Briefly, a certain amount of Bioglass\u00ae was suspended in \n\nultra-pure water. Produced scaffolds could then be wet with this Bioglass\u00ae-water \n\nsuspension by using this simple methodology. After drying for a certain time \n\nunder air flow, each sample was immersed in 40ml of simulated body fluid (SBF) \n\n(x1) (see Figure 1).  \n\nThe ion concentrations of SBF were approximately equal to those of human \n\nblood plasma.  The tubes were put in an incubator at 37\u00b0C for 7 days.

After the first day of immersion, \n\nrenewal was every 2 days for the solution. In the end of the immersion period, \n\nsamples were washed with distilled water and dried at room temperature. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1. Shematic representation of a novel biomimetic Ca-P coating process \n\nusing a simple spray. \n\n \n\n2.3. Characterization of Ca-P Coated Scaffolds \n\nIn order to analyze the morphology of the Ca-P layer formed on the scaffolds, the \n\nsamples were mounted onto brass stubs, sputter coated with gold and analyzed \n\nunder a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) at an accelerating voltage 15kV. \n\nElectron Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) was also used to determine the \n\npresence of Ca and P in bioactive layers. To evaluate the changes on the \n\nchemical structure of sample surface, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy \n\n(FTIR-ATR) was used. Thin Film X-ray diffraction (TF-XRD) was used for \n\nidentifying the crystalline phases present, and characterizing the \n\ncrystalline/amorphous nature of the formed Ca-P bioactive layers. \n\n2.4. Cell Culture Studies with Osteoblasts \n\nA human osteoblasts SaOs-2 cell line was selected to study cell morphology, \n\nattachment and proliferation onto Ca-P coated chitosan fiber meshes scaffolds. \n\nCells cultured in DME Media (Sigma), enriched with 10% FBS (Biochrome) and \n\n1% antibiotic/antimicotic solution (Sigma) were seeded directly over samples in a \n\nconcentration of 2x106 cells/scaffold. Incubation was performed at 37 \u00baC (5% \n\n\n\n 97\n\nCO2, 100% humidity) for 3 weeks. Uncoated samples were used as a control. \n\nAfter each incubation period, samples were washed with Phosphate Buffer \n\nSaline (PBS, Sigma) solution and fixed in gluteraldehyde 2.5% (v/v). For \n\nScanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM) observation, samples were previously \n\ndehydrated in increasing alcohol concentrations (50%, 70%, 90% and 100%), air-\n\ndried and sputter coated with gold.  \n\nCell viability  \n\nA MTS assay was carried out to determine the cell viability after 3 weeks of \n\nculture by using Cell Titer 96\u00ae Aqueous One Solution Cell proliferation Assay kit \n\n(Promega, USA). This test is based on the bioreduction of the substrate, (3-(4,5-\n\ndimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2(4-sulfophenyl)-2H \n\ntetrazolium) (MTS), into a brown formazan product by NADPH or NADP \n\nproduced by dehydrogenase enzymes in metabolically active cells. According to \n\nthe standard procedure, the triplicates of samples were placed in a new plate and \n\nfresh medium was added to each well. MTS reagent in 5/1 ratio was added to \n\neach well and then incubated for three hours at 37 \u00baC in a humidified atmosphere \n\ncontaining 5% of CO2.  A 100\u00b5l of incubated medium was transferred to 96-well \n\nplate culture plate and the optical density was read at 490nm in a micro-plate \n\nreader (Synergy HT, Bio-tek). \n\nAlkaline Phosphatase (ALP) Activity \n\nIn order to determine the amount of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) produced by the \n\ncells seeded on the scaffolds, scaffolds/ cells constructs were washed, freeze-\n\nthawed and sonicated after 3 weeks of culture. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) \n\nwas added to the supernatant in the ratio of 1/3 and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. \n\nThe enzyme reaction was then stopped by a solution containing 2 M NaOH and \n\n0.2 mM EDTA in distilled water. The absorbance of p-nitrophenol (pNP) formed \n\nwas determined at 405 nm with a reference filter at 620 nm. A standard curve \n\nwas made using pNP values ranging from 0 to 600 \u00b5mol/ml. The results were \n\nexpressed as \u00b5mol of pNP produced/ml/h. \n\n\n\n 98\n\n3. Results&amp;Discussion \n\n3.1. Biomimetic Coating \n\nThe scaffolds used in this study were porous chitosan fiber meshes of a \n\ncylindrical shape with a diameter of 1cm (Figure 2).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Chitosan fiber mesh scaffolds produced by wet spinning \n\n The structure is made of randomly oriented fibers with an average \n\ndiameter of 100\u00b5m and these fibers form a highly interconnected nest-like \n\nstructure as it can be seen from SEM micrographs (see Figure 3.A and B). As we \n\nhave reported before [21], these scaffolds have a very high water uptake ability, \n\nwhich can of course provide better adhesion of Bioglass\u00ae particles on the \n\nsurface of the fiber during the biomimetic coating process. However the coating \n\nof biodegradable scaffolds with biomimetic Ca-P layers is rather difficult and not \n\nmany examples of this can be found on the literature [22, 23]. \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3. SEM micrographs of chitosan fiber mesh scaffolds; A) x15, B) x200 \n\nA B \n\n\n\n 99\n\nSEM micrographs of Ca-P coated chitosan fiber mesh scaffolds were given in \n\nFigure 4.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4. SEM micrographs of the developed coated scaffolds, exhibiting a fine \nand homogenous Ca-P layer onto chitosan fiber meshes surfaces; A) x100, B) \nx300, C) 500, D) x5000 \n\n After Bioglass\u00ae spraying to the samples, a fine and homogenous Ca-P \n\nlayer was observed on their surface after 7 days soaking in SBF solution. Kokubo \n\net al. [24, 25] proposed the mechanism of bone-like apatite formation on \n\npolymeric surfaces when CaO-SiO2 glass particles are used as a nucleation-\n\ninducing agent. According to this mechanism, silicate ions released from the \n\nglass particles are attached on the polymer surface and Si-OH groups in the \n\nsilicate ions induce the apatite nucleation on the surface. At the same time, the \n\nrelease of calcium ions from glass particles increases the ionic activity product of \n\nSBF with respect to apatite and accelerates the apatite nucleation. Finally, the \n\napatite nuclei formed on the surface grow spontaneously by consuming Ca and P \n\nA B \n\nC D \n\n\n\n 100\n\nions from the fluid. Using this approach, many flat polymeric surfaces have been \n\ncoated with bone-like apatite by rolling the samples in Bioglass\u00ae/water \n\nsuspension [26]. However, the rolling process is not suitable for more complex \n\nsurfaces due to the non-homogenous distribution of Bioglass\u00ae particles. \n\nTherefore, we developed a simple spraying method which allowed a \n\nhomogenous distribution of glass particles on the scaffold surface as well as \n\ninside the structure. As a result of this method, a homogenous bone-like apatite \n\nlayer was observed on the individual fibers. Moreover, it was also possible to see \n\nthe typical cauliflower morphology of bone-like apatite layer in SEM micrographs \n\nwith a higher magnification (Figure 4.D).  \n\n The EDS spectra of the coated samples confirmed the formation of apatite \n\nlayer by showing the Ca and P elements (Figure 5). The typical Ca-P ratio was \n\naround 1.6 \u00b10.10 which is similar to natural bone apatite.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.

These results demonstrated that the surfaces of \n\nthe chitosan fibers were completely coated by a carbonated apatite layer. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.

Another main diffraction peak at 2?=26\u00b0 indicated the \n\n(002) lattice plane of apatite crystals. Other diffraction peak of apatite appeared \n\naround at 2?=40\u00b0 as it was marked in Figure 7. The broad peak at around 2?=20\u00b0 \n\nwas due to the chitosan. The intensity of this peak decreased after coating which \n\nconfirms once again the apatite layer on the surface of fibers.  \n\n3.2.

The cells were observed to be able to attach and to proliferate in \n\nboth surfaces. However, they seemed to be more spread and presented a \n\ndifferent morphology when the surface was pre-coated with a Ca-P layer. This is \n\na result of the changes in the surface chemistry of the scaffolds. Several \n\ninvestigators have reported that the surface chemistry and the topography can \n\ndirectly affect the osteoblast response and determine cell attachment and \n\nalignment [29-31]. Depending on the surface composition and the topography, \n\nprotein, ligands and integrins can adsorb to the surface in different structures and \n\nadhesion kinetics [32]. Due to the different interaction between the adhesion \n\nligands adsorbed to different surfaces and the adhesion receptors of the cells, \n\ncells can generate different adhesion signals. These adhesion signals influence \n\nA B \n\nC \n\n\n\n 104\n\nfurther cell attachment and morphology. In the present study, it was not possible \n\nto evaluate the effect of surface topography because of the irregular surface \n\nstructure of the chitosan fibers. However, we can say that the surface chemistry \n\nhas a clear clear influence on cell attachment and morphology. The difference on \n\nthe cell spreading behaviour could also be observed clearly with a longer \n\nculturing time. The osteoblasts started to form a complete layer on the surface of \n\nfibers after 3 weeks of culture (Figure 9. B).  \n\nThe Ca-P coating also influenced the long-term cell viability on the \n\nscaffolds. Figure 10 shows the MTS results after 3 weeks of culture. MTS is an \n\nindirect assay to determine the metabolic activity and number of the cells. As it \n\ncan be seen, osteoblasts seeded on the Ca-P coated scaffolds showed higher \n\nO.D. value than control samples which means metabolic activity and number of \n\ncells were higher in the Ca-P coated samples. This can be related to the \n\nenhanced cell attachment on the Ca-P coated samples. In fact, it has been \n\nreported that initial cell attachment affects further proliferation of the cells [33].  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10.

One possible \n\nreason for that can be the release of the Ca2+ ions from the coating to the culture \n\nmedium. Matsuoka et al. [35] showed that ALP activity and osteogenic \n\ndifferentiation of osteoblastic cells increased if there is an increase of Ca \n\nconcentration in culture medium by release from the apatite.

Conclusions \n\nA novel and simple biomimetic approach was described for the preparation of \n\nbone-like apatite coated chitosan scaffolds. Fiber mesh type scaffolds could be \n\nprepared from chitosan by a wet spinning method. A homogenous Ca-P coating \n\nwas produced on the surface and the bulk of chitosan scaffolds by means of \n\nusing the proposed methodology. After 7 days of immersion in the SBF solution, \n\na fine and homogenous bone-like apatite layer was observed on the surface of \n\nchitosan fibers. Furthermore, osteoblasts adhered on Ca-P coated samples \n\nshowed a more spread and distinct morphology. Higher cell numbers were \n\nobserved on the caoted scaffolds as compared to the uncoated samples.

Introduction \n\nTissue engineering offers a promising new approach to create biological \n\nalternatives for regeneration of different tissues. It involves the use of tissue-\n\nspecific cells seeded in a scaffold which can guide the cell growth and tissue \n\nformation in three dimensions. To bring about the desired biological response, a \n\nscaffold should possess a number of characteristics such as three dimensional \n\nhighly porous and interconnective structure, large surface area, adequate pore \n\nsize, suitable surface chemistry and mechanical properties, etc. [1] \n\nBiodegradable polymeric fiber structures can provide a large surface \n\narea and a relatively large porosity which can be optimized for specific \n\napplications. Besides these, many tissues, such as nerve, muscle, tendon, \n\nligament, blood vessel, bone, and teeth, have tubular or fibrous bundle \n\narchitectures and anisotropic properties. Therefore, fiber-based structures find a \n\nnumber of applications in tissue engineering, including soft tissue repair [2], \n\nvascular prostheses [3], bone [4, 5] and cartilage scaffolds [6], among others.  \n\nThere are three main techniques to produce fibers to be used in \n\nbiomedical applications: melt spinning, dry spinning and wet spinning. Melt \n\nspinning is based on the extrusion of polymeric melt while the spinning process \n\nstarts from polymeric solution in the case of dry and wet spinning. Most of the \n\nsynthetic polyester fibers used in tissue engineering are produced by a \n\nconventional melt spinning technique [7, 8]. However, excessively high \n\nprocessing temperatures may result in monomer formation during extrusion \n\nprocess. The excess monomer can catalyze the hydrolysis of the material. The \n\nwet spinning technique is an alternative way to produce biodegradable \n\npolyester fibers for the use in tissue engineering [9-12]. The fiber properties can \n\nbe tailored depending on the spinning rate, the concentration of the polymer \n\nsolution and coagulation bath. A highly viscous solution and high spinning rate \n\nallow fiber precipitation at the bottom of the coagulation bath. This approach \n\ncould be used to form scaffolds during the processing. \n\nIn design of a tissue engineering scaffold, surface physicochemistry is \n\none of the most important issues to be considered. The physicochemical \n\nproperties of the surface directly influence the scaffold performance by effecting \n\nthe cellular response and ultimately effecting the new tissue formation [13]. In \n\n\n\n  114\n\norder to improve the cell affinity, the surface hydrophilicity, surface energy, \n\nsurface roughness and surface charge can be modify by different methods, \n\nincluding mechanical treatments, wet chemical treatments and plasma \n\ntreatments. Chemical treatments have been widely used to modify the \n\nbiomaterial surfaces [14, 15]. However, the main problem of these treatments is \n\nthe influence of the treatment on the bulk properties of the material. The surface \n\nof the materials can be modified by plasma tretment without altering the bulk \n\nproperties of the material [16, 17]. By this technique, it is possible to introduce \n\nor graft desired functional groups and polymer chains onto the surface. The \n\nsurface roughness which plays an important role for cell attachment can be also \n\nchanged by plasma treatment. Therefore, plasma is a valuable method for \n\nimprove cell affinity to the tissue engineering scaffolds.  \n\nIn the present study, we describe a new route for the production of \n\nstarch-based fiber mesh scaffolds which allows forming of scaffolds during \n\nspinning. This new route also avoids polymer degradation which is the main \n\nproblem of melt-based systems. The surface properties of the produced \n\nscaffolds are tailored by plasma treatment in order to enhance cell attachment \n\nand proliferation \n\n2. Materials&amp;Methods \n\n2.1. Materials \n\nA blend of starch/poycaprolactone (SPCL) (30/70 wt %) was used to produce \n\nfiber mesh scaffolds. More information on these materials can be found \n\nelsewhere. All the reagents used were analytical grade unless specified \n\notherwise.   \n\n2.2. Wet Spinning Process \n\nStarch-based fiber mesh scaffolds were originally produced by wet spinning. In \n\norder to obtain a polymer solution with proper viscosity, SPCL was dissolved in \n\nchloroform at a concentration of 40% (w/v). Please note that, it was possible to \n\nobtain a homogenous suspension of starch particles into the solution even \n\nthough the only the synthetic part of the blend was soluble in the chloroform. \n\nMethanol was used as a coagulant. The polymer solution was loaded into a \n\n\n\n  115\n\nsyringe and placed in a syringe pump (World Precision Instruments, UK). A \n\ncertain amount of polymer solution was subsequently extruded into a \n\ncoagulation bath. The fiber mesh structure was formed during the processing by \n\nthe random movement of the coagulation bath. The formed scaffolds were then \n\ndried at room temperature overnight in order to remove any remaining solvents. \n\nAfter spinning, the internal architecture of the produced fiber meshes was \n\ncharacterized by micro-computed tomography (\u00b5CT) [18]. The surface \n\nmorphology of the fibers was analyzed under a scanning electron microscope \n\n(SEM, Leica Cambridge S360 microscope). Specifically, three specimens were \n\nscanned in air using a \u00b5CT imaging system (\u00b5CT40, Scanco Medical AG, \n\nBassersdorf, Switzerland) with a nominal resolution of 12 ?m. The \n\nreconstructed images were filtered using a constrained 3D Gaussian filter to \n\npartially suppress noise in the volumes (\u00b5 = 1.2 voxel, support = 1 voxel), and \n\nbinarized using a global threshold. Standard 3D morphometry as developed for \n\ntrabecular bone was used to assess structural parameters for the scaffolds. \n\nThese parameters included porosity and scaffold surface-to-volume ratio and \n\nwere derived from a triangulated mesh allowing for computation of surface and \n\nvolume [19]. In addition, pore size and fiber thickness were determined using \n\nthe distance transformation method [20]. In this method, each pore (fiber) is \n\nfilled with a non-redundant set of maximal spheres. Mean pore (fiber) size was \n\nthen calculated as the volume-averaged diameter of all spheres making up the \n\npore (fiber).  \n\n2. 3. Plasma Surface Treatment \n\nIn order to improve cell attachment and proliferation, a plasma treatment was \n\nperformed using a plasma reactor PlasmaPrep5 (Gala Instrument GmbH, \n\nGermany) with a chamber size of 15 cm diameter and 31 cm length (5L) and \n\nwith a fully automated process control. In order to maximize the surface area to \n\nbe exposed to the plasma, the samples were wired (necklace like) with a \n\ndistance of 1 cm between them. The wire was fixed to a metal support which \n\nwas placed into the chamber. The chamber was flushed with argon five times \n\nprior to treatment. A radio frequency (RF) source was used and a power of 30 \n\nW was applied for 15 minutes. Argon was used as a working gas and the \n\n\n\n  116\n\npressure in the reactor was controlled (0.18 mbar) by adjusting its flow rate. The \n\nsamples were kept 24 hours after being removed from the reactor and then \n\ncharacterized. \n\nX-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) \n\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to quantitatively determine \n\nthe surface composition of the scaffolds. The XPS analysis were performed \n\nusing an 250 iXL ESCA instrument (VG Scientific) equipped with two X-Ray \n\nsources: a source with Al Ka1,2 monochromatized radiation at 1486.92 eV and \n\nanother one (Dual) equipped with two anodes: Mg and Al. \n\nThe nonconductive nature of the samples required the use of an electron \n\nflood gun to minimize surface charging. Charge compensation at the surface \n\nwas performed by using both a low energy flood gun (electrons in the range 0 to \n\n14 eV) and an electrically grounded stain steel screen placed directly on the \n\nsample surface.  \n\n The first attempt to measure the samples was the use of the \n\nmonochromatic X-ray source. However, this was impossible due to the high \n\nroughness of the samples which caused problems to build up the charge. \n\nGenerally, charge neutralization for 3D surfaces is more difficult because of the \n\n\u201choles\u201d on the surface. The best choice for these cases is Mg source which \n\nhelps to neutralize the surface charge. Therefore, the measurements were \n\ncarried out using non-monochromatic Mg-K? radiation (h?=1253.6 eV). \n\nPhotoelectrons were collected from a take off angle of 90\u00ba relative to the sample \n\nsurface. The measurements were performed in the constant analyzer energy \n\nmode (CAE) with a 100 eV pass energy for survey spectra and 20eV pass \n\nenergy for high resolution spectra. C1s high resolution scans were taken before \n\nand after experiments in order to check out the efficiency of charge \n\ncompensation. \n\n Charge referencing was done by setting the lower binding energy C1s \n\nhydrocarbon (CHx) peak at 285.0 eV.  \n\n The atomic composition of the samples was determined from the survey \n\nspectra using the standard Scofield photoemission cross sections. The \n\nchemical functional group identification was obtained from the high-resolution \n\n\n\n  117\n\npeak analysis of C1s envelopes. The spectra fitting were performed using the \n\n\u201cChi-squared\u201d algorithm to determine the goodness of a peak fit.  \n\n2. 4. Cell Culture Studies \n\nA human osteoblast-like cell line (SaOs-2) was used to test the cell attachment \n\nand proliferation on the scaffolds. A 1ml of cell suspension containing 3x105 \n\ncells in a culture medium (DMEM low glucose supplemented with 10% Fetal \n\nBovine Serum and 1% antibiotics/antimicotics) were dropped onto scaffolds \n\n(n=3).  The cells on scaffolds were then allowed to grow for 2 weeks at 37\u00b0C in \n\nhumidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 with medium changes every 2-3 \n\ndays. \n\nMorphological Analysis \n\nFor the morphological examination, cell/scaffold constructs were rinsed with \n\nPhosphate Buffer Saline (PBS, Sigma, USA) and then fixed in 2.5% \n\nglutaraldehyde. The samples were dehydrated through graded series of ethanol \n\nand dried before mounting onto brass stubs, sputter coated with gold. Finally, \n\nthe samples were analyzed under a scanning electron microscope (SEM) at an \n\nacceleration voltage of 15kV. \n\nCell Proliferation-DNA Assay \n\nCell proliferation was evaluated by quantifying DNA content using the \n\nPicoGreen dsDNA kit (Molecular Probes, USA). PicoGreen dsDNA Quantitation \n\nReagent is an ultra-sensitive fluorescent nucleic acid stain for quantitative \n\nanalysis of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in solution. \n\nFor the assay, the scaffold/cell constructs (n=3) were rinsed with PBS \n\nand incubated with sterile ultra pure water at 37\u00b0C for 1h before putting at -\n\n80\u00b0C. The samples were then thawed and put in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min. \n\nAn aliquot of each sample was transferred to the 96-well plate. A certain ratio of \n\nTris-EDTA buffer and PicoGreen reagent prepared in the same buffer was \n\nadded to the each well. The fluorescence was read at 485nm and 528nm \n\nexcitation and emission, respectively. The DNA amount of each samples was \n\nthen calculated using a standard curve.  \n\n\n\n  118\n\nAlkaline Phosphatase (ALP) Activity \n\nAlkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity from the scaffolds/cells constructs (n=3) \n\nwas quantified by the specific conversion of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) \n\ninto p-nitrophenol (pNP). To perform the assay, the seeded scaffolds were \n\nrinsed with PBS and transferred individually into eppendorf containing sterile \n\nultra pure water. They were then frozen at -80oC and defrosted at room \n\ntemperature before starting the assay. A buffer solution containing 0.2% w/v p-\n\nnitrophenyl phosphate was added to the samples in a ratio of 1:3. The enzyme \n\nreaction was carried out at 37\u00b0C for 1 h and then stopped by a solution \n\ncontaining 2 M NaOH and 0.2 mM EDTA in distilled water. The absorbance of \n\np-nitrophenol formed was determined at 405 nm with a reference filter at 620 \n\nnm. A standard curve was made using pNP values ranging from 0 to 600 \n\n\u00b5mol/ml. The results were expressed as \u00b5mol of pNP produced/ml/h.  \n\nStatistical Analysis \n\nAll the quantitative results were obtained from triplicate samples. Data were \n\nexpressed as a mean \u00b1SD. For statistical analysis, a two-tailed Student's t-test \n\nwas used. Differences were considered to be significant at p&lt;0.05.  \n\n3. Results and Discussion \n\n3.1. Morphology of the scaffolds \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.

It can be clearly seen that, the \n\nSPCL fibers were randomly formed into a 3D structure. The porosity of the \n\nscaffolds, determined by \u00b5CT, was 77%. \u00b5CT morphometry showed that fiber \n\ndiameter was 100\u00b5m; mean pore size was 250\u00b5m, which is in the range of ideal \n\npore size for bone regeneration [21]. The scaffolds have a high surface to \n\nvolume ratio: the specific scaffold surface was 29 mm2/mm3, similar to that of \n\nnative bone [20]. Moreover, \u00b5CT showed that wet-spinning was a very \n\nreproducible procedure; the coefficient of variation (CV) for fiber thickness was \n\n4.2%; for the other parameters, CV was 1.2% or below. \n\nPrevious studies have reported that 2D polymer surfaces could be easily \n\nmodified by different plasma techniques [22-24]. However, it becomes more \n\ncomplicated in the case of 3D porous polymeric structure due to the pore \n\nstructures and low interconnectivity which do not allow the penetration of \n\nplasma exposition in the interior part of the structure because of the shadow \n\neffect. In the present study, the wet-spun scaffolds produced presented a highly \n\nporous and interconnected structure that can overcome this problem of plasma \n\nsurface modification. In the case of wet-spun scaffolds, the treatment is very \n\nsimilar to treatment of a single fiber. As a result, the surface exposed to the \n\nplasma is much higher, which allows for a more uniform and effective surface \n\ntreatment. \n\n3.2. Plasma Treatment \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. The surface of the SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds; A) before (x3000) and  \nB) after Ar plasma treatment (x3000). \n\nA B \n\n\n\n  120\n\nDue to phase inversion during precipitation, the surface of the fibers \n\nexibited a non-smooth morphology (Figure 2.A). After plasma treatment, a \n\nsignificant difference on the fiber surfaces was observed (Figure 2.B). It is well \n\nknown that the surface roughness typically tends to increase after a plasma \n\ntreatment due to the so-called etching process [25]. When the plasma is \n\ncomposed of an inorganic gas such as argon, helium, hydrogen, nitrogen, and \n\noxygen, it leads to the etching reactions on the topmost layer of the polymer \n\nsurface [26]. This etching is a result of stripping off the topmost layer of the \n\npolymer because of the weight loss of the polymer during the plasma exposure. \n\nHowever, the SPCL fiber surfaces showed a denser and smaller nano-size \n\nroughness after plasma treatment. Since SPCL has a very low glass transition \n\ntemperature (-60\u00b0C), it can be explained by melting and etching that \n\nconsecutively occured on the surface during the plasma process.  \n\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed in order \n\nto obtain more detailed information for the chemical structures and groups \n\npresented on the surface before and after the performed modification. The \n\nresults obtained are summarized in Table 1.  \n\n \n\nTable 1.

The difference \n\nbetween the bulk and surface composition of the material is not a surprise. It \n\nhas been reported [27, 28] that in polymeric systems, the composition near to \n\nthe surface can be markedly different from the bulk. In fact, due the high \n\ncomplexity of blend chemistry, different components may predominate at the \n\n\n\n  121\n\nC O\n\nO\n\n* *\n\nn\n\n285 eV\n\n286.4 eV288.8 eV\n\n \n\n294 292 290 288 286 284 282 280\n\n5000\n10000\n15000\n20000\n25000\n30000\n35000\n40000\n\nC\nou\n\nnt\ns\n\nBinding Energy [eV]\n294 292 290 288 286 284 282 280\n\n5000\n\n10000\n\n15000\n\n20000\n\n25000\n\n C\nou\n\nnt\ns\n\nBinding Energy [eV]\n \n\nA B \n\nsurface, depending on the blend composition, crystallinity of the components, \n\ncomplexity and degree of miscibility of the system, processing conditions and \n\nalso the nature of surrounding environment [27-29]. However, after plasma \n\nmodification the oxygen content on the surface increase and an O/C ratio of \n\n0.32 was measured (compared to 0.26 for the untreated material). Oxidation is \n\nnot the only process which is taking place on the surface during the plasma \n\ntreatment. As can be seen from the table the percentage of carbon was also \n\nchanged after the treatment; it reduced from 76.9 to 69.7 confirming the \n\npresence of some etching. \n\nMore detailed analyze of C1s core level spectra of SPCL fiber mesh \n\nsamples (Figure 3) showed that they contain three main peaks \u2013 at 285 eV, \n\nwhich was assigned to the main carbon backbone, at 286.4 eV for ?C?O? and \n\nat about 288.8eV for carboxyl bonded carbons. This is not unexpected since the \n\nmain component of the blend poly(?-caprolactone) has all of those bonds \n\npresent in its structure.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3. C1s core level spectra for wet-spun SPCL fiber meshes A) before and \nB) after Ar plasma treatment \n \n\nThe intensity of the peaks at 286.4 eV and 288.8 eV increased after \n\ntreatment as it can be seen from Figure 3. The created active species on the \n\nsurface by Ar plasma are very reactive and can recombine with the oxygen from \n\n\n\n  122\n\nA B \n\nthe air. As a result surface functionalization with different oxygen containing \n\ngroups occurs on the surface and this is the reason for the observed differences \n\nin the C1s core level spectra. It should be noted that the occurred surface \n\noxidation is not as powerful as the one in which oxygen plasma is employed; in \n\nthe latter case much more hydrophilic surfaces are produced which do not \n\npromote protein adsorption and consequently do not favour cell adhesion. \n\n3.3. Cell Culture  \n\nMorphological Analysis \n\nThe morphology and the shape of the osteoblast seeded onto both untreated \n\nand plasma treated fiber meshes showed a clear difference after different time \n\nof culturing (Figure 4, 5, and 6). It was observed that the cells were able to grow \n\nand making a film on the treated surface while they were in spindle-like shape \n\nwith cytoplasmic extension on the untreated surface after 3 days of culture \n\n(Figure 4).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.

As it was discussed above, \n\nthe oxygen content of the fiber surfaces significantly increased after plasma \n\ntreatment due to degradation and functionalization of the fiber surfaces. It is \n\nknown that osteoblasts are attachment-dependent cell [30]. They can only \n\nproduce and mineralize their extracellular matrix if they attach in a proper \n\nsurface that allows specific cell-surface interaction. They also can recognize the \n\nchanges in the surface topography if it is above 0.5 \u00b5m [31]. Therefore, DNA \n\namount was significantly different between untreated and treated scaffolds after \n\n3 and 7 days of culture (p=0.045 and p=0.015 for 3 and 7 days, respectively) \n\nwhile it was not significant after 14 days (Figure 7). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6. Cell viability and proliferation of human osteoblast like cells \n\ndetermined by DNA. Error bars represent means \u00b1 SD for n=3.   \n\n \n\nThis can be explained by the effect of plasma treatment in the initial \n\nstage of culture. By plasma treatment, it is possible to increase the serum \n\nprotein adsorption on the surfaces which would be resulted in an increase of \n\ninitial cell attachment. Once they reached confluency, the rate of cellular death \n\nand proliferation becomes equal and hence the proliferation stops. This fact can \n\nexplain the decrease in the difference between untreated and treated samples \n\nafter 14 days of culture.  \n\n\n\n  125\n\nALP activity \n\nAlkaline phosphatase is an enzyme which is used as an early marker for \n\nosteoblast differentiation. Although its exact role is not very clear, it is known \n\nthat it plays an important role in bone matrix mineralization process [30]. \n\nRegarding the present experiments, ALP activity of the cells cultured onto the \n\nSPCL fiber meshes increased with the culture period (Figure 8). The enzyme \n\nactivity of the cells was found to be even higher if the scaffolds were treated by \n\nplasma. On the other hand, the differences in the enzymatic activity between \n\nthe cells seeded on untreated and treated scaffolds decreased after 14 days of \n\nculture. It has been reported that the deposition of extracellular matrix occurs \n\nbefore the mineralization starts [32]. This latest stage of cell differentiation \n\nprecedes mineralization and thereby ALP enzyme activity which is associated \n\nwith calcification tends to decrease [33, 34]. This phenomenon can explain the \n\nALP results from the present study indicating that the cells cultured on \n\nuntreated and treated scaffolds might be in different stage of differentiation. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8.

Conclusions \n\nA new route was described to produce starch-based fiber mesh scaffolds.

The scaffolds could be formed, in a very reproducible \n\nmanner, during the process by means of optimizing the processing conditions. \n\nFurthermore, the developed scaffolds were able to support osteoblast-like cell \n\nattachment and proliferation. As a second step, the scaffolds surfaces were \n\nmodified by using Ar plasma. After plasma treatment, the surface morphology \n\nand surface chemical composition of the fibers were significantly changed. \n\nOsteoblast-like cells were able to recognize these physical and chemical \n\nchanges on the surface and they showed higher cell viability and ALP enzyme \n\nactivity on the treated scaffolds. \n\nAs a final conclusion, these results suggested that starch-based fiber mesh \n\nscaffolds can be easily processed by a wet spinning technique into adequate \n\nscaffolds. Subjecting these scaffolds to Ar plasma can enhance their suitability \n\nfor tissue engineering applications. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  127\n\nReferences \n\n1.

This work was developed in order to produce scaffolds for \n\nsupporting bone cells. Nano and micro fiber combined scaffolds were originally \n\nproduced from starch based biomaterials by means of a fiber bonding and a \n\nelectrospinning, two step methodology. The cell culture studies with SaOs-2 \n\nhuman osteoblast-like cell line and rat bone marrow stromal cells demonstrated \n\nthat presence of nanofibers influenced cell shape and cytoskeletal organization \n\nof the cells on the nano/micro combined scaffolds. Moreover, cell viability and \n\nAlkaline Phosphatase (ALP) activity for both cell types was found to be higher in \n\nnano/micro combined scaffolds than in control scaffolds based on fiber meshes \n\nwithout nanofibers.   \n\nConsequently, the developed structures are believed have a great potential on \n\nthe 3D organization and guidance of cells that is provided for engineering of 3-\n\ndimensional bone tissues. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n 133\n\n1. Introduction \n\nBone tissue engineering has become a rapidly expanding research area since it \n\noffers a new and promising approach for bone repair and regeneration. Several \n\nrequirements have been considered for engineering bone, including choosing a \n\ncell type that matures/differentiates into bone cells with the proper form and \n\nphenotype, regulating the growth factors and designing a so-called ideal scaffold \n\n[1]. The requirements for the design and production of an ideal scaffold are also \n\nvery complex and not yet fully understood. An ideal scaffold must be \n\nbiocompatible both in bulk and degraded form, exhibit a porous, interconnected, \n\nand permeable structure to permit the ingress of cells and nutrients, and should \n\nexhibit the appropriate surface structure and chemistry for cell adhesion and \n\nproliferation. The processing techniques used to obtain polymeric scaffolds \n\ninclude solvent casting and particulate leaching, gas foaming, freeze drying, \n\nrapid prototyping, thermally induce phase separating, fiber bonding, melt molding \n\nand electrospinning, as reviewed elsewhere [2]. Several techniques aim to \n\nproduce a scaffold which can mimic in some way the architecture of the natural \n\nextracellular matrix (ECM).  \n\nNatural extracellular matrix (ECM) is composed of various protein fibrils \n\nand fibers interwoven within a hydrated network of glycosaminoglycan chains [3]. \n\nThis network structure serves as a scaffold which can support tensile and \n\ncompressive stresses by the fibrils and hydrated networks. Besides providing an \n\nappropriate microenvironment for cells, ECM is responsible for transmitting \n\nsignals to cell membrane receptors that reach nucleus via intracellular signaling \n\ncascades. Therefore, the fibrillar and porous structure of ECM have a great \n\ninfluence on cell functionality, mainly on cell adhesion and migration. \n\nIn last few years, the electrospining processes have attracted a great deal \n\nof attention as a way to try to mimic the structure of natural ECM by means of \n\nproducing fibers down to 3nm [4]. This process is based on the generation of an \n\nelectrical field between a polymeric solution (or a polymer melt) placed in a \n\ncapillary tube with a pipette or needle of small diameter and a metal collector. \n\n\n\n 134\n\nWhen the electrical field reaches its critical value, repulsive electrostatic force \n\novercomes the surface tension of the polymeric solution and a charged jet is \n\nproduced. This charged polymeric jet then undergoes a stretching process which \n\nis accompanied by the rapid solvent evaporation and results the formation of long \n\nand thin fibers [5]. Electrospining has been used to fabricate nanofibrous \n\nstructures from a number of both natural synthetic polymers, such as collagen \n\n[6], chitosan [7], chitin [8], silk fibroin [9] and polyethyleneoxide [10], poly(DL-\n\nlactide-co-glycolide) [11], poly(L-lactide) [12], and polycaprolactone [13], among \n\nmany others. The produced nanofibrous polymeric networks have been proposed \n\nfor engineering of many different tissues. For instance, Li et al. [14] reported that \n\nelectrospun poly(?-caprolactone) membranes could promote chondrocyte \n\nproliferation and provide  maintenance of chondrogenic phenotype. In another \n\nstudy, polyurethane and gelatin have been used to design a mesoscopically \n\nordered structure for using as an artificial graft [15]. Recently, it has been shown \n\nthat nanofibrous PCL mats could be used as a scaffold to support differentiation \n\nof human mesenchymal stem cell cultured in specific differentiation media [16]. \n\nSilk fibroin based nanofibrous matrices have also been tested with human bone \n\nmarrow stromal cells and proposed as a scaffold for bone tissue engineering \n\n[17].        \n\nThough there are many studies that have been proposing nanofibrous \n\npolymeric mats for tissue engineering, they have a limitation for 3D applications \n\ndue to their pore size which is smaller than a cellular diameter and can not allow \n\ncell migration within the structure. Furthermore, the small size of the fibers tends \n\nnot to maximize the points of cell attachment which is a negative effect on the \n\nexpression of several factors and on cell spreading and differentiation. \n\nIn the present study, we have developed a novel structure which \n\ncombines polymeric micro and nanofibers in the same construct that is aimed to \n\nserve as a scaffold and mimic the physical structure of ECM for bone tissue \n\nregeneration, but simultaneously still providing the macro support that cells do \n\nrequire.  \n\n\n\n 135\n\n2. Materials&amp;Methods \n\n2.1. Materials \n\nStarch-based scaffolds with a 70% porosity were prepared from a blend of \n\nstarch/poycaprolactone (SPCL) (30/70 wt%) by a fiber bonding process as \n\ndescribed elsewhere [18]. All the reagents used were analytical grade unless \n\nspecified otherwise.  \n\n2.2. Electrospinning Process \n\nElectrospinning was used to obtain nanofibers onto SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds. \n\nThe aim was to impregnate, as much as possible, the micro-fiber scaffolds with \n\nelectrospun nanofibers. The solution used in the electrospinning experiments \n\nwas prepared by dissolving 1g of SPCL in 7 ml chloroform. After dissolution was \n\ncompleted, 3 ml of dimethylformamide (DMF) which has a high dielectric \n\nconstant was added to the solution to enhance electrospinning of the solution.  \n\nThe polymer solution was then electrospun to the both side of the SPCL \n\nfiber mesh scaffolds. Briefly, a polymer solution was placed in a simple capillary \n\nglass tube vertically. A special designed collector was used to move samples \n\nthrough the electrospun polymeric jets. A 15kV voltage was provided by a high \n\npower supply at a distance of 10cm between a collector and a capillary tube for \n\n10s. \n\nMorphological Analysis  \n\nThe developed structures were analyzed by optical microscopy (Olympus, MIC-\n\nD). To observe more detail in morphology of the nanofibers on the scaffolds, a \n\nscanning electron microscope (SEM) (Leica Cambridge S360 microscope) was \n\nalso used.  \n\n2.3. Cell Culture \n\nThe developed structures were tested with two different cell type, a human \n\nosteoblast-like osteosarcoma SaOs-2 cell line and rat bone marrow stromal cells. \n\n\n\n 136\n\nIn both experiment sets SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds without electrospun \n\nnanofibers were used as controls.  \n\nIn the cell culture experiments with a human osteoblast-like SaOs-2 cell \n\nline, cells were seeded onto the scaffold using a density of 3x105 cells/scaffolds \n\nand allowed to grow for two weeks, with medium (DMEM low glucose \n\nsupplemented with 10% Foetal Bovine Serum, 1% antibiotics/antimicotics \n\nchanges every 2 days.  \n\nRat bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSC) were obtained from the femoras \n\nand tibias of 4 weeks-old male Wistar  rats (Charles River, Spain) as described \n\nelsewhere [19]. Briefly, femurs and tibias were aseptically excised, cleaned of \n\nsoft tissue, and washed in ?-MEM (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) \n\ncontaining 10 times more amount of normal antibiotics concentration in order to \n\navoid contamination during the harvest. Then, the epiphyses were cut off, and \n\nthe diaphyses flushed with 5 ml of complete medium [?-MEM (minimal essential \n\nmedium); Eagle, Sigma, St. Louis, MO], supplemented with 10 % FBS (foetal \n\nbovine serum; Biochrome), 50 \u00b5g/mL ascorbic acid (Sigma), 50 \u00b5g/mL \n\ngentamycin, 1% antibiotics/antimicotics, 10 mM ?-glycerophosphate (Sigma), \n\nand 10-8M dexamethasone (Sigma)]. Cells were cultured at 37 \u00baC in a humidified \n\natmosphere containing 5 % of CO2. \n\nThe confluent cell monolayers were detached using trypsin/EDTA (0.25% \n\ntyripsin/0.02% EDTA, Sigma) and resuspended in complete medium. A 50\u00b5l of \n\ncell suspension containing 3x105 cells were pippeted onto the each scaffold. \n\nCell/scaffold constructs were incubated at 37C for 2h to allow RBMSC to diffuse \n\ninto and adhere to the scaffolds before adding 1 ml of culture medium to each \n\nwell.  The cells on the scaffolds were then allowed to grown for 2 weeks at 37\u00b0C \n\nin a humidified atmosphere containing 5% of CO2 with medium changes every 2-\n\n3 days. \n\nMorphological Analysis \n\nAfter 7 and 14 days of culture, cell/scaffold constructs were fixed in 2.5% \n\nglutaraldehyde, dehydrated through graded series of ethanol and dried. The \n\n\n\n 137\n\nsamples were mounted onto brass stubs, sputter coated with cold and analyzed \n\nunder a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) at an accelerating voltage 15kV.  \n\nCell proliferation Assay \n\nAfter 7 and 14 days of culture, cell viability was assessed by using Cell Titer 96\u00ae \n\nAqueous One Solution Cell proliferation Assay kit (Promega, USA). This test is \n\nbased on the bioreduction of the substrate, (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-\n\ncarboxymethoxyphenyl)-2(4-sulfophenyl)-2H tetrazolium) (MTS), into a brown \n\nformazan product by NADPH or NADP produced by dehydrogenase enzymes in \n\nmetabolically active cells. For this assay, culture medium was removed, samples \n\nwere washed with PBS before the addition of serum free medium plus Cell Titer \n\n96\u00ae Aqueous One Solution (5/1 ratio). The samples were then incubated for three \n\nhours at 37 \u00baC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % of CO2. A 100 \u00b5l of \n\nincubated medium was transferred to 96-well plate culture plate and the optical \n\ndensity was read at 490 nm in a micro-plate reader (Synergy HT, Bio-tek). \n\nAlkaline Phosphatase (ALP) Activity \n\nAlkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity from the scaffolds/ cells constructs was \n\nquantified by the specific conversion of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) into p-\n\nnitrophenol (pNP). The enzyme reaction was carried out at 37\u00b0C for 1 h and then \n\nstopped by a solution containing 2 M NaOH and 0.2 mM EDTA in distilled water. \n\nThe absorbance of p-nitrophenol formed was determined at 405 nm with a \n\nreference filter at 620 nm. A standard curve was made using pNP values ranging \n\nfrom 0 to 600 \u00b5mol/ml. The results were expressed as \u00b5mol of pNP \n\nproduced/ml/h. Please note that ALP activity was determined in weekly collected \n\nsupernatant and lysed cell for SAOS-2 and RBMSC, respectively. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 138\n\n \n\n700\u00b5m \n\n3. Results&amp;Discussion \n\n3.1. Nano- and micro fiber combined scaffolds  \n\nFigure 1.A presents the images of the newly designed combined nano/micro fiber \n\nstructures. As it can be seen, nanofibers could be randomly electrospun on the \n\nmicrofibers and they present the structure that looks like a nanobridge between \n\nthe microfibers which is very similar to the architecture of ECM [20]. The average \n\ndiameter of produced SPCL nanofiber was measured to be around 400nm \n\n(Figure 1.B). Moreover, nanofibers presented a fine morphology without \n\npresence of beads which is refered as a common problem of electropsun fibers \n\n[4]. These results also confirmed that the processing parameters were \n\nsuccessfully optimized in order to produce fine nanofibers from SPCL. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Microscopic images of the scaffolds. Figure B presents a detailed view \nof nanofibers as observed by SEM. \n\n3.2. Cell Culture  \n\nMorphological Analysis \n\nRegarding cell culture studies with SaOs-2 and RBMSC, cell responses in both \n\ncases were clearly different to the nano/micro fiber combined scaffolds when \n\ndirectly compared with the control fiber mesh scaffolds. It was observed that \n\nthere were significant differences, mainly those related with cell shape and \n\nmorphology, which could indicate that the patterned layered by the nanofibers \n\nA \nB \n\n\n\n 139\n\nA \n\nB \n\nD \n\nC \n\nwas leading to a different cytoskeleton rearrangement on the seeded cells. SEM \n\nimages showed that cells had covered microfibers and started to fill the spaces \n\nbetween the latter using for that purpose the previously laid down nanofibers \n\nafter 7 days of culture. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.

Human osteoblast like cells on control scaffolds after 14 days of culture \n \n\nFigure 2 shows confluent growth on combined scaffolds and control by the SaOs-\n\n2 osteoblast-like cell line. As it can be observed the cell population growing on \n\nthe combined scaffolds presented a different organization being able to bridge \n\nbetween microfibers. The presence of nanofibers also led to the changes in cell \n\nmorphology (Figure 2.C and D). Cells along the nanofibers showed very \n\nstretched morhologhy. This fact can be particular useful as this cytoskeletal \n\nrearrangement could affect gene expression, as described by a report of Curtis \n\nand Wilkonson [21]. It has been claimed that when the cells stretch themselves, \n\nthe receptors are also stretched and activated. This results on the expression of \n\ndifferent genes than those observed in unstretched cells. This particular \n\nhypothesis will be further confirmed in forthcoming (already ongoing) studies. A \n\nsimilar cell response was observed in the study with RBMSC (Figure 4). After 14 \n\ndays of culture, the scaffolds were covered by cells which used nanofibers to \n\nbridge between microfibers (Figure 4.B and C). \n\nIt is known that human cells can attach and organize themselves well \n\naround the fibers diameter smaller than those of the cells [22]. This approach \n\nmight explain the behavior of the cells on the developed combined scaffolds. This \n\ncell organization could provide better and faster colonization of the scaffolds with \n\ncells which is of main importance for tissue engineering approaches. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 141\n\nA \n\nB \n\nD \n\nC \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.

The MTS assay is based on a \n\nreduction reaction which reduced MTS reagent to brown formazan product when \n\nincubated with viable cells. Thus, the absorbance of formazan indirectly reflected \n\nthe metabolic activity of cells, which is also associated with cell number.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.

After 7 and 14 days of culturing O.D. values were found to \n\nbe considerably different for combined scaffolds in both studies. These results \n\nindicate that both cell types seeded on combined scaffolds showed increasing \n\nmetabolic activity and growth rates when directly compared with the control. This \n\nfact is closely related with the previously deposited nanofiber mesh. While \n\nreducing large void spaces between the pores the mesh is creating additional \n\nstructures where cells can adhere from the very beginning, avoiding at the same \n\ntime that the cell suspension drops through the pores until it reaches the bottom \n\nof the wells. This particular phenomena shows the validity of the proposed \n\nmethodology for increasing the cell seeding and culturing conditions during the \n\ndevelopment of bone tissue engineered constructs. \n\nALP Activity \n\nALP is a well-known enzyme used as a marker of the osteogenic phenotype, \n\nwhich catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphate esters at an alkaline pH [23]. The \n\nskeletal isoform of ALP is a glycoprotein found on the cell membrane of \n\nosteoblasts [24]. It has been also demonstrated that it plays an important role in \n\nbone matrix mineralization process.  \n\nFigure 7 and 8 shows the ALP activity of SaOs-2 and RBMSC cultured on \n\nthe combined scaffolds and control scaffolds. In both cases, the enzyme activity \n\nof scaffolds with nano fibers was higher than that of control in the end of first \n\nweek. In the case of RBMSC, the differences in enzyme activity became even \n\nhigher after a second week of culture. This is probably related with the different \n\nproliferation rates of the cells seeded on the different scaffolds and at the same \n\ntime with a probable more induced osteogenic phenotype. The latter hypothesis \n\nmight be related with the cytoskeleton rearrangement caused by the nanofibers. \n\nHowever further studies are needed to evaluate the influence of these structures \n\non the differentiation of osteogenic cells. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 144\n\n0,0\n\n0,5\n\n1,0\n\n1,5\n\n2,0\n\n2,5\n\n3,0\n\n3,5\n\n4,0\n\n4,5\n\n5,0\n\n14\n\n \n\n \n\n7\n\np-\nny\n\ntr\nop\n\nhe\nno\n\nl (\n\u00b5\n\nm\nol\n\n/m\nl/h\n\n)\n\ntime (days)\n\n control\n combined\n\n \n\n0,0\n\n0,5\n\n1,0\n\n1,5\n\n2,0\n\n2,5\n\n3,0\n\n3,5\n\np-\nny\n\ntr\nop\n\nhe\nno\n\nl(\n\u00b5\n\nm\nol\n\n/m\nl)\n\n147\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ntime (days)\n\n control\n combined scaffolds\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7.

Conclusions \n\nAn electrospinning technique was used to produce nanofibers on SPCL fiber \n\nmeshes in order to combine nano- and microfibers in the same 3D scaffold \n\narchitecture. It was clearly demonstrated that cell response changed completely \n\nwith the addition of nanofibers on the fiber meshes. Osteoblasts were organized \n\n\n\n 145\n\nto bridge between microfibers and this resulted in scaffolds completely filled with \n\ncells after two weeks of culture. Moreover, the presence of nanofibers had an \n\ninfluence in cell morphology which was observed to be much more streched and \n\nspread. The scaffolds without nanofibers did not show this kind of organization \n\nand the morphology of cells remained normal, and forming a continuous cell \n\nmonolayer over microfibers. Furthermore, cells seeeded on combined scaffolds \n\nshowed higher viability and ALP activity than that on control. \n\nThe results from this study indicate that nano- and micro-fiber scaffolds can \n\nprovide an ideal structure for cell deposition and organization. Their unique \n\narchitecture which supports and guides the cells makes them a suitable \n\ncandidate for bone tissue engineering applications \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n 146\n\nReferences \n\n1.

The studies discussed herein can \n\nbe divided in two main parts: \n\n\u2022 Development of chitosan-based fiber structures; \n\n\u2022 Development of starch-based fiber structures.  \n\nDevelopment of chitosan-based fiber structures; \n\nIn the studies of this part, chitosan, which is a biocompatible, biodegradable and \n\nnon-toxic natural polymer, was chosen for fiber production.  Fibers with different \n\ndiameters were produced by means of wet spinning for use in different purposes. \n\nChitosan fibers with diameter around 200\u00b5m presented an oriented surface \n\nmorphology due to rolling up procedure during processing, which could be called \n\nas a kind of stretching. This property of the fibers would then provide a \n\nmechanical strength for the combined architecture where the chitosan fibers \n\nwere used to reinforce the structure. These combined architectures were \n\ndeveloped from coralline origin hydroxyapatite particles, chitosan membranes \n\nand chitosan fibers being aimed serve as a scaffold for tissue engineering or to \n\nbe used in guided tissue regeneration by mimicking the arrangements in natural \n\nbone.     \n\nChitosan fibers with a smaller diameter were also produced, with the same \n\nprocessing procedure, and shaped into 3D randomly oriented fiber meshes. \n\nThese fiber meshes showed to support well cell adhesion of osteoblast-like cells. \n\nConsidering the use of these scaffolds in bone regeneration, it was important to \n\nhave osteoconductivity in order that osteoblast and osteoprogenitor cells can \n\neasily attach and migrate in the scaffold. Based on this fact, the surface of \n\nchitosan fiber mesh scaffolds were pre-coated with a bone-like apatite layer. A \n\nnew coating approach, using a spray, applied in these experiments due the \n\n\n\n 151\n\ncomplex structure of chitosan fiber meshes, was herein proposed. As a result of \n\ncoating, the osteoblast cell behaviour completely changed when they were \n\ncultured on the coated scaffolds.    \n\nDevelopment of starch-based fiber structures \n\nIn this part, two different types of scaffolds were developed from a \n\nstach/polycaprolactone blend: (i) wet-spun SPCL fiber meshes and (ii) nano- and \n\nmicro-fiber combined scaffolds.  \n\nThe wet spinning technique was also used in this part as an alternative \n\nroute for production of SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds. By this technique, the physical \n\nproperties (such as diameter, thickness, porosity, etc.) of the scaffolds can be \n\nadjusted depending on the specifications. Another important advantage of using \n\nthis technique is that the scaffolds can be formed during processing without any \n\nneed for a further processing step. In this part of the studies, it was possible to \n\nobtain the fiber mesh scaffolds with adequate porosity and the mean pore size \n\nwhich were in the proposed range for an ideal scaffold for bone tissue \n\nengineering. Considering the relation between cell attachment and surface \n\nproperties of a scaffold, the ability of the scaffold surface for cell attachment \n\ncould be enhanced by applying an Ar plasma treatment. The results from the cell \n\nculture studies demonstrated that the treatment worked quite effectively on \n\nenhancing cell attachment and proliferation.      \n\nIt is known that, the ideal scaffold should be one which closely mimics the \n\nnatural extracellular matrix (ECM). Having this in consideration, we originally \n\ndeveloped nano- and micro-fiber combined scaffolds from the same blend in the \n\nfinal study of the thesis. The basic point of this concept was to use nanofibers for \n\nmimicking the physical structure of natural ECM. The micro support for cells was \n\nprovided by SPCL microfiber meshes produced by melt spinning. The presence \n\nof nanofibers in the structure showed great influence on cell morphology, viability \n\nand differentiation. In fact, cells cultured on combined scaffolds presented \n\ndifferent cell organization than that on SPCL fiber meshes without nanofibers. \n\n\n\n 152\n\nThe cells tended to stretch themselves along the nanofibers and to bridge \n\nbetween microfibers. This stretched morphology led to a difference in \n\ndifferentiation rate which could be related with the different gene expression \n\nprofiles. \n\nFurthermore, the presence of nanofibers seemed to be an advantage for \n\nincreasing the cell seeding efficiency, resulting in an increase in cell viability.  \n\nFinal Remarks/Future Research \n\nThe results obtained in the studies discussed in this thesis showed that, tissue \n\nengineering scaffolds with different shapes and properties can be designed by \n\nusing fibers from natural origin polymers. One of the most promising designs \n\nseemed to be the one which combines the nano and microfibers in the same \n\nstructure. By means of following the same concept, new scaffolds can be \n\ndesigned in the presence of different natural polymers such as collagen, silk \n\nfibroin (consists of glycosaminoglycans), which are presented in the natural \n\nextracellular matrix. The author of the present thesis wants to play an active role \n\non taking forward these kind of approaches.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\tkadriye.pdf\n\tP\u00e1gina 1\n\tP\u00e1gina 2\n\tP\u00e1gina 3"}]}}}
