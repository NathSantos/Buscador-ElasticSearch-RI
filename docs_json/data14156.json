Materiais comp\u00f3sitos podem ser produzidos pela \"tecnologia \n\ndo p\u00f3\", na qual basicamente o p\u00f3 met\u00e1lico e/ou cer\u00e2mico \u00e9 compactado \n\ne, por fim, sinterizado. A sinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 um processo de densifica\u00e7\u00e3o, \n\nonde ocorre a consolida\u00e7\u00e3o do material e \u00e9 a etapa respons\u00e1vel por \n\nconferir for\u00e7a e resist\u00eancia \u00e0 pe\u00e7a. Assim, nota-se que o controle dessa \n\netapa \u00e9 determinante para se atingir as propriedades desejadas \u00e0 pe\u00e7a \n\nfinal. Em paralelo, simula\u00e7\u00f5es num\u00e9ricas do processo de sinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ns\u00e3o uma alternativa em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a custosos e longos experimentos f\u00edsicos. \n\nUma metodologia de simula\u00e7\u00e3o num\u00e9rica muito promissora \u00e9 chamada \n\nde M\u00e9todo dos Elementos Discretos (DEM \u2013 Discrete Element Method). \n\nDiferentemente dos m\u00e9todos cont\u00ednuos de simula\u00e7\u00e3o, o DEM considera \n\ncada part\u00edcula do sistema como um elemento distinto e \u00e9 ideal para a \n\nsimula\u00e7\u00e3o de meios granulares, como \u00e9 o caso da sinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o. Assim, \n\nesse projeto tem por objetivo simular e analisar o processo de \n\nsinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o em estado s\u00f3lido de materiais comp\u00f3sitos utilizando o \n\nM\u00e9todo dos Elementos Discretos. O software utilizado foi o MUSEN, \n\ndesenvolvido na Universidade Tecnol\u00f3gica de Hamburgo (TUHH - \n\nAlemanha). Os materiais do comp\u00f3sito utilizado nas simula\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o \n\nn\u00edquel (metal) e alumina (cer\u00e2mico). Especificamente, esse trabalho visa \n\ninvestigar a influ\u00eancia de diferentes propor\u00e7\u00f5es de metal/cer\u00e2mico em \n\namostras monomodais (apenas um tamanho de part\u00edcula) durante a \n\nsinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o. Al\u00e9m disso, a influ\u00eancia de part\u00edculas maiores de metal em \n\namostras bimodais tamb\u00e9m foi analisada. Entre as an\u00e1lises conduzidas, \n\nfoi avaliado o crescimento do raio de contato das part\u00edculas entre os \n\ndiferentes tipos de contatos: metal-metal, cer\u00e2mico-cer\u00e2mico e metal-\n\ncer\u00e2mico. O n\u00famero de coordena\u00e7\u00e3o das part\u00edculas com esses 3 tipos de \n\ncontato tamb\u00e9m foi investigado. Finalmente, a influ\u00eancia de diferentes \n\npar\u00e2metros no comportamento de densifica\u00e7\u00e3o foi analisada e \n\ncorrelacionada com o crescimento de raio de contato e n\u00famero de \n\ncoordena\u00e7\u00e3o entre as part\u00edculas. A partir dos resultados, foi poss\u00edvel \n\nconfirmar que a modelagem modificada foi capaz de simular a \n\nsinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o de comp\u00f3sitos, mesmo para estruturas interpenetrantes. Os \n\nresultados das amostras monomodais foram divididos em tr\u00eas diferentes \n\ncomportamentos de sinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o: controladas pelo metal, controladas \n\n\n\n \n\npelo cer\u00e2mico e estruturas interpenetrantes. As amostras controladas \n\npelo metal apresentaram as maiores taxas de densifica\u00e7\u00e3o e atingiram as \n\nmaiores densidades relativas ao final da simula\u00e7\u00e3o. As part\u00edculas de \n\nmetal (neste caso n\u00edquel) possuem um potencial maior para sinterizar \n\nmais r\u00e1pido que a alumina devido ao seus par\u00e2metros cin\u00e9ticos e energia \n\nsuperficial. Tamb\u00e9m foi observado que a adi\u00e7\u00e3o de uma segunda fase \n\ncom uma menor atividade de sinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o (alumina) reduz a densifica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nglobal em compara\u00e7\u00e3o com o puro metal e leva mais tempo para atingir \n\na mesma densidade relativa. As estruturas interpenetrantes apresentaram \n\nas menores densifica\u00e7\u00f5es globais dentre todas amostras devido \u00e0 \n\ndensifica\u00e7\u00e3o independente da fase met\u00e1lica e cer\u00e2mica. Esse \n\ncomportamento conduziu \u00e0 forma\u00e7\u00e3o de muitas fissuras e rachaduras ao \n\nlongo da amostra e a estrutura inicial foi perdida, formando na verdade \n\numa estrutura porosa. Os resultados das amostras bimodais mostraram \n\num crescimento mais lento do raio de contato para part\u00edculas maiores de \n\nn\u00edquel, como \u00e9 esperado. Entretanto, a densifica\u00e7\u00e3o global foi maior \n\npara amostras com maiores part\u00edculas de n\u00edquel. Esse comportamento \n\nn\u00e3o era esperado, por\u00e9m pode ser explicado pela configura\u00e7\u00e3o das \n\npart\u00edculas em estruturas interpenetrantes. Nessas estruturas, n\u00e3o existe \n\numa fase \u201cmatriz\u201d, a fase met\u00e1lica e cer\u00e2mica formam redes cont\u00ednuas \n\nde part\u00edculas, chamados de caminhos de percola\u00e7\u00e3o. Quando part\u00edculas \n\nmenores est\u00e3o presentes nessas estruturas, elas apresentam maior for\u00e7a \n\nde sinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o, rapidamente se atraem, formam longos aglomerados de \n\npart\u00edculas e a densifica\u00e7\u00e3o global praticamente n\u00e3o ocorre. Por outro \n\nlado, part\u00edculas maiores induzem menores for\u00e7as de sinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o. Assim, \n\nas for\u00e7as viscosas entre contatos alumina-n\u00edquel s\u00e3o suficientes para \n\nmanter esses contatos unidos e, consequentemente, a densifica\u00e7\u00e3o global \n\npode ser observada. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: M\u00e9todo dos elementos discretos, sinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o, \n\nsimula\u00e7\u00e3o, comp\u00f3sitos, metal-cer\u00e2mico, n\u00edquel, alumina. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\nComposite is a class of material made by the combination of two or \n\nmore materials, which produces a third one with unique characteristics. \n\nFor this reason, composites have a wide range of engineering \n\napplications, such as spacecrafts and sports\u2019 equipment. Composite \n\nmaterials can be suitably produced by Powder Metallurgy. In this \nmanufacturing process, the blend of different powders is shaped and \n\nlater sintered at high temperatures for consolidation of the part. Thereby, \n\nsintering is considered a densification process, which is responsible for \n\nproviding strength and stiffness to the material or composite. Moreover, \n\nits control is essential to reach the desired properties of the final part. In \n\naddition, numerical simulations of the sintering process represent an \n\nalternative procedure in relation to the lengthy and costly physical \n\nexperiments. A well-known simulation technique is the Discrete \n\nElement Method (DEM). In contrast to continuum methods, DEM \n\nconsiders every particle of the system as a single element and it is \n\nrecommended to simulate granular media, such as sintering. Thus, the \n\ngeneral purpose of this project is to simulate and analyze the solid-state \n\nsintering process of composite materials when both materials are \n\nsintering using DEM. The software used is the MUSEN system, \n\ndeveloped at TUHH \u2013 Germany. The materials chosen for the composite \n\nare nickel (metal) and alumina (ceramic). Specifically, the present work \n\naims to investigate the influence of varying contents of metal/ceramic in \n\nmonosized samples during sintering. These contents range from metal \n\nvolume fraction of 0.9 to 0.1, and include pure metal and ceramic \n\nbodies. Furthermore, the effect of larger metallic particles in the sample \n\nis also investigated for a constant metal volume fraction of 0.6. Among \n\nthe analyses carried out, the contact size growth was evaluated \n\nconsidering the interfaces metal-metal, ceramic-ceramic and metal-\n\nceramic. The coordination number of the particles within these three \n\ncontacts is also analyzed. Finally, the influence of the varied parameters \n\non the densification behavior is investigated and correlated with the \n\ncontact size growth and coordination number evolution. The results have \n\nshown that the special modeling was capable to simulate sintering of \n\ncomposites even in case of interpenetrating structures. The simulation \n\nresults of the monosized packing can be divided in three different \n\nsintering behaviors: metal-controlled, ceramic-controlled and \n\ninterpenetrating structures. The metal-controlled samples have shown \n\nthe highest densification rates and relative density evolution, as one \n\n\n\n \n\nmight expect. The nickel particles have higher potential to sinter faster \n\nthan alumina due to their kinetic parameters and surface energy. Hence, \n\nmetal particles induce high forces to shrink the system and indirectly \n\ntransfer forces to the sintering of ceramic phase. Interpenetrating \n\nstructures have shown the lowest overall densification due to \n\nindependent densification of metal and ceramic phase. It has led to large \n\ncracks through the samples and the initial structure has been lost. The \n\nresults of bimodal packings have shown a slower growing of the contact \n\nradius for larger nickel particles, as expected. However, the global \n\ndensification has been higher for samples with larger nickel particles. \n\nThis unexpected behavior can be explained due to the particle \n\nconfiguration and distribution of forces in the interpenetrating structures. \n\nSmaller particles induce higher forces, quickly agglomerate themselves \n\nand are not capable to drive a global densification. On the other hand, \n\nlarger particles induce weaker sintering forces. Thereby, the resistance \n\nforce between nickel-alumina contacts is high enough to keep these \n\ncontacts attached and, consequently, a global densification can be \n\nobserved.  \n\n \n\nKeywords: Discrete Element Method (DEM), sintering, simulation, \n\ncomposites, metal/ceramic, nickel, alumina. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLIST OF FIGURES \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1: General fabrication pattern of sintered parts [8]. ............... 34 \n\nFigure 2.2: Density of fused silica prepared by solid-state sintering \n\nmethod as function of sintering time [12]. ............................................ 35 \n\nFigure 2.3: Scanning electron micrograph of the sintering necks formed \n\nbetween bronze particles after sintering at 800 \u00b0C [10]. ....................... 36 \n\nFigure 2.4: The taxonomy of the sintering technique [2]. .................... 37 \n\nFigure 2.5: Representation of the sintering stages with a focus on the \n\nchanges in pore structure during sintering [10]. .................................... 39 \n\nFigure 2.6: Schematic showing a typical densification curve of a \n\npowder compact and the three stages of sintering [8]. .......................... 40 \n\nFigure 2.7: Schematic representation of the paths of sintering \n\nmechanisms for a system of two particles [8].

This class of materials is made by the \n\ncombination of two or more materials, which produces a third one with \n\nunique characteristics if compared to the materials separately. For this \n\nreason, composites have a wide range of engineering applications, such \n\nas spacecrafts, airplanes, automobiles, boats, sports\u2019 equipment, bridges, \n\nbuildings and others [1].  \n\nComposite materials, mainly particulate composites, can be \n\nsuitably produced by Powder Metallurgy. In this manufacturing process, \nthe blend of different powders is shaped and later sintered at high \n\ntemperatures for consolidation of the part. During sintering, the particles \n\nof the powder create solid bonds between each other in order to reduce \n\nthe total surface energy of the system so that the porosity of the body is \n\ndecreased during the process. Hence, sintering is considered a \n\ndensification process, which is responsible for providing strength and \n\nstiffness to the material or composite. Moreover, its control is essential \n\nto reach the desired properties of the final part [2]. \n\nIn addition, numerical simulations of the sintering process \n\nrepresent an alternative procedure in relation to the lengthy and costly \n\nphysical experiments, so that time and costs may be reduced. Moreover, \n\nif the simulations are well dimensioned, not only the scientific aspects of \n\nthe physical phenomena are addressed, but also industrial aspects may \n\nbe incorporated into the models in order to make process more efficient \n\nin terms of energy and costs. Thus, the main goal of simulation \n\ndevelopments in powder metallurgy is to describe analytically the \n\ncomplete process chain from the powder filling into the die to the final \n\nin-service behavior, in order to optimize material and process properties \n\nfurther [3].  \n\nA well-known simulation technique is the Discrete Element \n\nMethod (DEM). In contrast to continuum methods, DEM considers \n\nevery particle of the system as a single element, which interacts by \n\nmodeling of forces. Continuum methods are based on phenomenological \n\nmodels that rely on empirical assumptions about the macroscopic \nbehavior of materials. Thereby, they neglect effects due to the \n\nmicrostructure of materials such as heterogeneities and anisotropy. In \n\nDEM, these microstructural effects are naturally taken into account. \n\nParticularly for sintering simulation, DEM can also be used to \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\ninvestigate the contact size between particles, coordination number \n\n(number of contacting particles), particles rearrangement, particles size \n\ndistribution, cracks formation, among others. Furthermore, macroscopic \n\nbehavior such as densification can be analyzed conveniently.  \n\nDEM has been used to simulate solid-state sintering in three \n\ndimensionally system in the last ten years, including the works of Martin \n\net al. (2006) [4] and Henrich et al. (2007) [3]. Considering DEM \n\nsimulation of powder mixtures, only few references can be found in the \n\nliterature [5,6]. In such works, the authors have considered the ceramic \n\nphase as hard inclusions, which do not sintering. Therefore, no work \n\nwas reported so far, in which both metallic and ceramic materials are \n\nsintering. \n\nIn this context, the general purpose of this master thesis is to \n\nsimulate free solid-state sintering process of composite materials when \n\nboth materials are sintering using Discrete Element Method (DEM). The \n\nmaterial parameters used in the simulations are related to nickel (metal) \n\nand aluminum oxide (alumina; ceramic). As free solid-state is the \n\nsintering technique simulated, neither liquid phase nor pressure is \n\nconsidered. The sintering temperature used through the simulations is \n\nbelow the melting point of both materials, but high enough for both \n\nceramic and metal sinter.  \n\nSpecifically, the present work aims to investigate the influence \n\nof varying contents of metal/ceramic in monosized samples during \n\nsintering. These contents range from metal volume fraction of 0.9 to 0.1, \n\nand include pure metal and ceramic bodies. In order to investigate \n\nwhether the lack of periodic boundary conditions affect the simulation \n\nresults, a simulation of samples with higher number of particles is also \n\nperformed.  \n\nFurthermore, the effect of larger metallic particles in the sample \n\nis also investigated for a constant metal volume fraction of 0.6. Among \n\nthe analyses carried out, the contact size growth was evaluated \n\nconsidering the interfaces metal-metal, ceramic-ceramic and metal-\n\nceramic. The coordination number of the particles within these three \n\ncontacts is also analyzed. Finally, the influence of the varied parameters \n\non the densification behavior is investigated and correlated with the \n\ncontact size growth and coordination number evolution.  \n \n\n \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\n \n\n2 THEORETICAL BACKGROUND \n \n\nThis chapter is divided into four topics. First of all, composite \n\nmaterials are described and their classification is presented. Secondly, \n\nthe theory of sintering and the main features of powder metallurgy are \n\ndescribed. The phenomena that take place during sintering as well as the \n\nparameters which influence the sintering behavior are discussed. In third \n\nplace, the discrete element method is introduced and some important \n\nworks in the literature are presented. Finally, the mathematical model \n\nthat described the sintering phenomenon is presented. \n\n \n\n2.1 COMPOSITE MATERIALS \n \n\nComposites are a class of materials formed by the combination \n\nof two or more different materials that are mechanically or \n\nmetallurgically bonded together. The material components in \n\ncomposites can be metals (titanium, nickel, etc.), ceramics (aluminum \n\noxide, tungsten carbide, etc.) and organics (epoxy, PMMA, etc.). The \n\nkey advantage of composites is that they usually exhibit the best \n\nqualities of their components or constituents and often some properties \n\nthat neither component possesses. Such properties depend on the \n\napplication that the composite is designed for and they may be a \n\ncombination of stiffness, weight, strength, high-temperature \n\nperformance, corrosion resistance, hardness, conductivity, among others. \n\nHence, composite materials can reach a performance required by both \n\nengineering advanced systems and domestic applications where very \n\nspecific properties are needed [1].  \n\nThe origin of the distinct discipline of composite materials is \n\nreported since the beginning of the 1960s. However, the use of \n\ncomposite materials is much older. For example, medieval swords and \n\narmor were constructed with layers of different metals. In the latest 50 \n\nyears, the demand for materials with specific properties and high-\n\nperformance system has increased substantially in several fields as \n\naerospace, energy and civil construction. Airplanes represent a typical \n\napplication, where one material must exhibit light weight, high strength, \n\nstiffness and fatigue resistance [1]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nA common classification of composite materials is related to \n\ntheir structural constituents as: \n\n? laminar or layered composites; \n\n? fiber-reinforced composites; \n\n? particulate composites. \n \n\nLaminar composites consist of layers of at least two different \n\nmaterials that are bonded together. They are used to provide properties \n\nsuch as reduced cost, enhanced corrosion resistance or wear resistance, \n\nelectrical insulation or conductivity, unique expansion characteristics, \n\nlighter weight, improved strength or altered appearance. Safety glass is \n\nan example of this category in which a layer of polymeric adhesive is \n\nplaced between two pieces of glass and serves to retain the fragments \n\nwhen the glass is broken [7].  \n\nFiber-reinforced composites comprise continuous or discontinuous \n\nthin fibers that are embedded in a matrix of another material. The matrix \n\nsupports and transmits forces to the fibers, protects them from the \n\nenvironment and provides ductility and toughness, while the fibers carry \n\nmost of the load and impart enhanced stiffness. Glass-fiber-reinforced \n\nresins represent an important example of fibrous composites. With them \n\nit is possible to produce lightweight materials with high strength and \n\nhigh stiffness. In such a case, glass fibers about 10 \u00b5m in diameter are \n\nbonded in a variety of polymers, generally epoxy or polyester resins. \n\nCurrent uses of glass-fiber-reinforced plastics include sporting goods \n\n(snowboards), boat hulls and bathtubs [7].  \n\nParticulate composites are made of discrete particles of one \n\nmaterial surrounded by a matrix of another material. The particles can \n\nbe either metallic or nonmetallic, as well as the matrix. Concrete is a \n\nclassic example, consisting of sand and gravel particles surrounded by \n\nhydrated cement, where the particles are rather coarse. Another example \n\nare gridding and cutting wheels, which are often formed by bonding \n\nabrasives, such as aluminum oxide, silicon carbide, cubic boron carbide, \n\nor diamond, in a matrix of glass or polymeric material. The purpose of \n\nparticulate composites can be also to increase the toughness, by addition \n\nof cemented carbide in a metal matrix of cobalt. Combining tungsten \n\npowder and powdered silver or copper produces high conductivity and \n\nresistance to wear [7].  \n\nEven though the most common kind of particulate composites \n\nconsist of particle-matrix composites, there is another sort of structure \n\nfor particulate composites. When the volume fraction of the particulate \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n \n\nphase exceeds a certain amount, the particles start to form a continuous \n\nnetwork of particles. This kind of structure is called percolation \nnetwork. The volume fraction limit depends on the particle size \n\ndistribution width. For a wide particle size distribution, the limit value is \n\nabout 10% of the volume fraction, whereas for monosized particles its \n\nvalue is about 30% [5]. In such a case, the particle and matrix phase \n\ncannot be distinguished from each other, and this definition is not valid \n\nanymore. Therefore, this sort of system is called interpenetrating \n\nstructures, where both phases form continuous network in different \n\ndirections through the sample and distinct properties may be developed \n\ndue to this new sort of structure.  \n\nComposite materials, particularly particulate composites, may \n\nbe conveniently produced by powder metallurgical techniques. In this \n\ncase, the main advantage is that metal and ceramic powder can be mixed \n\nhomogeneously and in varying amounts in order to obtain different \n\nstructures and properties. Moreover, the technique versatility allows \n\nproducing parts with a wide variety of shapes and sizes [7].  \n\n \n\n2.2 POWDER METALLURGY \n \n\nPowder metallurgy is a process in which fine powdered \n\nmaterials are blended and pressed into a desired shape (compacted). The \n\ncompacted part is called green body. Then, the green body is heated \n(sintered) to establish desired properties. This process has expanded \n\nrapidly due to the recognition of the distinct advantages in terms of \n\nmaterials utilization, ease of components manufacturing, cost/energy \n\nsaving and other factors. Through the manufacturing process, sintering \n\nis an essential step, where the compacted material is heated in a \n\ncontrolled atmosphere and temperature to obtain the required density \n\nand strength [7]. Figure 2.1 shows a general processing pattern to \n\nproduce sintered parts [8]. Every step through the process has great \n\ninfluence on the sintering behavior and consequently in the shape and \n\nproperties of the end product.  \n\nThe technique used to produce the powder (chemical reduction, \n\nelectrolytic deposition, precipitation from solution, etc.) has influence on \n\nthe size, size distribution, shape and agglomeration of the particles. For \ninstance, smaller particles present higher surface energy and would \n\nincrease the sintering rate [9].  \n\n  \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1: General fabrication pattern of sintered parts [8]. \n\n \n \n\nAdditives used during powder preparation can change the \n\nshaping and/or sintering behavior, such as lubricants that reduce the \n\nfriction between particles and improve their rearrangement during \n\ncompaction [9].  \n\nDie compaction, isostatic pressing and slip casting represent \n\nsome possible techniques to be used in the shaping or forming step. \n\nDepending on the compaction technique employed, varying initial \n\ndensities (so-called green density; initial density of the sample that will \nbe sintered) may be obtained. The green density of a compact has direct \n\ninfluence on the densification behavior and hence on the strength of the \n\nproduct [9].  \n\nAlthough such steps before sintering are very important for the \n\noverall process, they are out of scope of this work and are not discussed \n\nin details. For instance, Richerson\u2019s book [9] explores the topic deeply. \n\n \n\n2.3 FUNDAMENTALS OF SINTERING \n \n\nSintering is a processing technique used to manufacture density-\n\ncontrolled materials and components from metal or/and ceramic \n\npowders by applying thermal energy. Sintering belongs to powder \n\nmanufacturing technology and represents a crucial step for reaching the \n\ndesired mechanical and other properties. Their application fields range \n\nfrom firing ceramic pots to fabrication of complex, high-performance \n\nshapes, such as medical implants and gas turbines [10]. \n\nIn fact, sintering is one of the oldest human technologies, \n\noriginating in the prehistoric era with firing of pottery to add strength. \n\nAncient Incas used this technique to produce jewelry and other artifacts \n\nfrom precious metal powder. Many other sintered ceramic structures can \n\nbe found around the world in ancient civilizations (Egypt, Mesopotamia, \n\netc), such as bricks, porcelains, vessels, etc. [11].  \n\nThe process has been used through the centuries for several \n\npurposes, but scientific understanding and controlled experiments have \n\nonly been developed in the 20\nth\n century. One of the earliest controlled \n\nPowder + \nAdditives \n\nMixing Shaping Sintering \n\nPost-\nsintering \ntreatment \n\nand \nfinishing \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\n \n\nexperiments was conducted by Muller in 1935. He sintered compacts of \n\nNaCl powder for a variety of times at several temperatures and \n\nevaluated the degree of sintering by measuring the strength of fracture \n\n[9].  \n\nEver since, remarkable developments have been done. The \n\napplication of scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron \n\nmicroscopy, and lattice imaging has allowed the investigation of \n\nmicrostructure changes at different stages of sintered parts, as well as \n\nthe density and shrinkage evolution may be plotted as function of time \n\n[9]. Figure 2.2 shows the empirical curve of the bulk density of fused \n\nsilica prepared by solid-state sintering method as function of sintering \n\ntime [12]. \n\n \nFigure 2.2: Density of fused silica prepared by solid-state sintering method \n\nas function of sintering time [12]. \n\n \n \n\n2.3.1 Sintering Process Overview \n \n\nAccording to German [2], \u201cSintering is a thermal treatment for \n\nbonding particles into a coherent, predominantly solid structure via \nmass transport events that often occur on the atomic scale. The bonding \n\nleads to improve strength and lower system energy.\u201d \nDuring sintering, a consolidation of loose or weakly bonded \n\npowder (green body) occurs by heating the material in a sintering \n\nfurnace at temperatures below its melting point but high enough to \n\npermit solid-state diffusion. Typical sintering temperatures, for example, \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\ncan range between 750-1000 \u00b0C for copper and 1350-1450 \u00b0C for \n\ncemented carbides [7].  \n\nThe main driving force for sintering is the reduction of the free \n\nsurface energy of powdered compacts, due to the elimination of internal \n\nsurface area associated with the pores. In the beginning of the process, \n\ncontacting particles start to create connections (necks). As sintering \n\nproceeds, the high temperatures allow atoms to move and the neck \n\ngrows, forming solid bonds between particles. Figure 2.3 shows a \n\nscanning electron micrograph of bronze particles after sintering at 800 \n\n\u00b0C, where necks between particles can be observed clearly [10].  \n\n \nFigure 2.3: Scanning electron micrograph of the sintering necks formed \n\nbetween bronze particles after sintering at 800 \u00b0C [10]. \n\n \n \n\nThroughout sintering process, the pores reduce in size, whereas \n\nthe density increases and product dimensions change (shrinkage). As a \n\nresult, the sintered part may have its strength, stiffness, ductility, \n\ntoughness, and electrical and thermal conductivities increased if \n\ncompared to the green body [7].  \n\nThere are different sintering techniques and the phenomena that \n\ntake place during the process change depending on the technique \n\napplied. Figure 2.4 shows a general categorization of sintering \n\ntechniques.  \n\nAs the first differentiation, sintering can be carried out with or \n\nwithout an external pressure (pressure-assisted and pressureless, \n\nrespectively). Most industrial sintering is performed without an external \n\npressure. Pressureless sintering is divided into liquid phase sintering or \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\n \n\nsolid-state sintering. Liquid phase sintering occurs when at least one \n\nmaterial melts during the process and a liquid is present in the system. \n\nSolid-state sintering occurs when the powder compact is densified \n\nwholly in a solid state at the sintering temperature. In solid-state, single \n\nphase is considered when only one material is sintered. Mixed phase \n\noccurs when a mixture of at least two kinds of powders is sintered to \n\nform composites and alloys [2].  \n\n \nFigure 2.4: The taxonomy of the sintering technique [2]. \n\n \n \n\nThe scope of the present work is the mixed phase in solid-state \n\nsintering (black part in Figure 2.4). Therefore, the following sections \n\nintroduce the concepts and phenomena related to this technique. Liquid \n\nphase and pressure-assisted sintering are not considered nor their related \n\nphenomena. \n\nA wide variety of parameters affects sintering and they may be \n\ndivided into two categories: material and process variables. Table 2.1 \n\nshows the main variables that influence the behavior during sintering \n\n[8]. \n\n \nTable 2.1: Variables that affect the sintering behavior [8]. \n\nProcess variables \nMaterial variables \n\nPowder Chemistry \n\nTemperature shape composition \n\nTime size impurity \n\nPressure size distribution non-stoichiometry \n\nAtmosphere agglomeration homogeneity \n\nHeating and cooling rate mixedness  \n\n \n\nSintering \nprocesses \n\nPressureless \n\nSolid-\nstate \n\nSingle \nphase \n\nMixed \nphase \n\nLiquid \nphase \n\nTransiente \nliquid \n\nPersistent \nliquid \n\nPressure-assisted \n\nLow \nstress \n\nCreep \nflow \n\nViscous \nflow \n\nHigh \nstress  \n\nPlastic \nflow \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\nThe process parameters are mostly thermodynamic variables \n\nand have great (and complex) influence in the sintering kinetics and the \n\nfinal properties of the sintered part. For example, higher temperatures \n\ninduce higher sintering rates and can improve the final properties though \n\nincrease the expense and complicate the process control.  \n\nThe variables related to the material are also of fundamental \n\nimportance to the process. For example, smaller particles have higher \n\ntotal surface energy and then higher driven force for sintering. Either it \n\nmeans that faster sintering (lower sintering time) or lower sintering \n\ntemperatures can be applied. For compacts containing more than two \n\nkinds of powder, the homogeneity is of prime importance to result in a \n\nsintered part with homogeneous and isotropic properties [8]. \n\n \n\n2.3.2 Thermodynamics of Sintering  \n \n\nFrom the thermodynamic point of view, sintering is an \n\nirreversible process in which surface energy of the particles plays the \n\nfundamental role. Surface energy induces some phenomena and it is \n\nimportant to distinguish them [8].  \n\nIn order to reduce the total surface energy of the system, the \n\nmain phenomena that take place during sintering are densification and \n\ngrain growth. The total surface energy of a powder compact is expressed \n\nas ???, where ??  is the specific surface energy and ? the total surface \narea of the compact. The reduction of the total surface energy of the \n\nsystem can be expressed as [8]: \n\ns ?(???) = ???? + ???? (2.1) \n\nThen, the change in surface energy ??? is due to densification, whereas \nthe change in the surface area ?? is due to grain growth. \n\nOn the other hand, for the neck formation and growth (and \n\nconsequently densification and grain growth) a mechanism for matter \n\ntransport must be present. The specific energy and curvature of the \n\nparticle surface provide an effective stress on the atoms under the \n\nsurface. For a curved surface with principal radii of curvature ??  \nand ??, this stress ? is proportional to the surface energy ?? and is given \nby Laplace\u2019s equation [10]:  \n\n \n\ns ? = ??(\n?\n\n?? \n+\n\n?\n\n??\n) (2.2) \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\n \n\nBecause the stress in the neck region is different from the \n\nneighboring region, atomic motion occurs to remove this gradient. \n\nUsually, atomic motions take place often via diffusional solid-state \n\nmechanisms. The high temperatures at which sintering are normally led \n\nare essential to allow the atoms to move. Such mechanism will be \n\ndiscussed in details further on. \n\n \n\n2.3.3 Stages of Solid-State Sintering \n \n\nSolid-state sintering is often divided into three overlapped \n\nstages: initial, intermediate and final stage. They are related to the \n\nsequence of physical changes that occur as particles bond together and \n\nthe porosity disappears. Figure 2.5 shows a representation of those \n\nstages as sintering proceeds [10]. Figure 2.6 shows a typical \n\ndensification curve of sintering versus time [8], which represents the \n\nthree stages and their relative density. \n\n \nFigure 2.5: Representation of the sintering stages with a focus on the \n\nchanges in pore structure during sintering [10]. \n\n \n \n\n(\n\na) \n\n(\n\nd) \n(\n\nc) \n\n(\n\nb) \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5 a) shows particles as a loose powder with a relative \n\ndensity (green density) defined by the compaction technique used [10]. \n\nFigure 2.5 b) represents the initial stage in which is characterized by the \n\nrearrangement of particles and the initial neck formation at the point of \n\ncontact between particles. The rearrangement consists of slight \n\nmovements of adjacent particles to increase the number of points of \n\ncontact. This mechanism can partially heal voids and defects present \n\nalong the sintered part. Normally curvature gradients inherent to the \n\npowder dictate the sintering behavior. As it is observed in Figure 2.6, the \n\ncontribution of this stage on the compact shrinkage is only 2-3% at the \n\nmost within a negligible time if the total sintering time is considered [8].  \n\nIn the intermediate stage (Figure 2.5 c), the size of the necks \n\ngrows and the center of the original particles moves closer together. This \n\nresults in shrinkage and the porosity decreases, so that the relative \n\ndensity can reach up to ~93%, as shown in Figure 2.6. During the \n\nsecond-stage, the pores are tubular and interconnected (open porosity) \n\n[10].  \n \n\nFigure 2.6: Schematic showing a typical densification curve of a powder \n\ncompact and the three stages of sintering [8]. \n\n \n \n\nThe final stage of sintering (Figure 2.5 d) corresponds to the \n\nelimination of the last ~7% of porosity, in which the pores are no longer \n\ninterconnected and become isolated. At this stage, grain growth plays a \n\nfundamental role in pore removal and porosity reduction. As observed in \n\nFigure 2.6, this stage is the slowest one and grain growth must be well \n\ncontrolled to achieve maximum removal of porosity. For example, if \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\n \n\ngrain growth is too rapid, the grain boundaries can move faster than the \n\npores and leave them isolated inside a grain. As the grain continues to \n\ngrow, the pore becomes further separated from the grain boundary and it \n\nhas a lower chance to be eliminated [9].  \n\n \n\n2.3.4 Kinect Mechanisms of Solid-State Sintering  \n \n\nThe reduction of the total surface energy of the system as \n\ndriving force for sintering induces some kinetic mechanisms for matter \n\ntransport. There are two main mechanisms in sintering: surface transport \n\nand bulk transport [10]. Surface transport, such as surface diffusion, \n\nvapor transport and lattice diffusion from the particle surface, results in \n\nneck growth without promoting shrinkage or densification of the system. \n\nIn this case, atoms come to the neck from the particle surface. It means \n\nthe atoms are rearranged along the surface and the interparticle distance \n\nis not reduced [8]. \n\nOn the other hand, in bulk transport mechanism the mass comes \n\nfrom the particle interior to be deposited at the neck, resulting in \n\napproximating the particles centers. Hence, this class of mechanism is \n\nresponsible, beyond the neck growth, for densification and shrinkage of \n\nthe system. Bulk transport includes grain boundary diffusion, lattice \n\ndiffusion from grain boundary (also called volume diffusion) and \n\nviscous flow [8]. Table 2.2 lists the major mechanisms for matter \n\ntransport and their related parameters. Figure 2.7 shows a schematic \n\nrepresentation for two sintering particles including the matter transport \n\npaths listed in Table 2.2.  \n\n \nTable 2.2: Material transport mechanisms during sintering [8, 10]. \n\nMaterial transport \n\nmechanism \n\nMaterial \n\nsource \n\nMaterial \n\nsink \nDensification \n\n1.

Grain boundary \n\ndiffusion \nGrain boundary Neck Yes \n\n5. Lattice diffusion Grain boundary Neck Yes \n\n6. Viscous flow Bulk grain Neck Yes \n\n \n\nThroughout sintering process, the dominant transport \n\nmechanism acting on the particles depends on temperature, kind of \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\nmaterial and stage of sintering. Relatively to the melting temperature of \n\nthe material, bulk transports are dominant at higher temperatures, \n\nwhereas surface transports are dominant at lower temperatures [10]. \n\nAmorphous materials, such as glasses and polymers, sinter in a \n\ndistinct way if compared to crystalline materials, since amorphous \n\nmaterials lack grain boundaries. These materials sinter by viscous flow \n\n(path 6 in Figure 2.7) involving the deformation of particles and the path \n\nalong which matter flows is not clearly specified. Viscous flow is driven \n\nby capillarity. This mechanism is well described by continuum \n\nconservation laws for momentum and mass. Particles coalesce at a rate \n\nthat depends on the particle size and material viscosity. If the \n\ntemperature increases, the material viscosity decreases and sintering \n\noccurs more rapidly. Thus, sintering temperature plays a fundamental \n\nrole in sintering of these materials [10]. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.7: Schematic representation of the paths of sintering mechanisms \n\nfor a system of two particles [8]. Numbers are related to the mechanisms in \n\nTable 2.2. \n\n \n \n\nSintering of polycrystalline materials such as metals and \n\nceramics cannot be described by viscous flow because extremely high \n\nstress is needed for matter flows in such structures. The primary \n\nmechanism for polycrystalline materials is diffusion, which is related to \n\nthe movement of atoms under a difference in vacancy concentration in \n\nthe lattice structure. Usually, more than one kinetic mechanism takes \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\n \n\nplace simultaneously during this process, as described by the paths 1 to \n\n5 in Figure 2.7.  \n\nVapor transport, represented by path 3 in Figure 2.7, usually \n\noccurs in materials with high vapor pressure. A weight loss of the part \n\nduring sintering can indicate that this mechanism is taking place. \n\nHowever, for most materials the contribution of this mechanism is small \n\nand can be neglected [10]. \n\nSurface diffusion takes place through the defects on the surface \n\nof crystalline materials, as shown by path 1 in Figure 2.7. This \n\nmechanism is already active during the heating-up step of sintering \n\nbecause its activation energy is less than other mechanisms. Its \n\ncontribution to the initiation of sintering is recognized for almost all \n\nmaterials. The influence of surface diffusion decreases as the defects are \n\nconsumed and the available surface area is lost to the neck growth [10]. \n\nLattice diffusion (volume diffusion) involves the motion of \n\nvacancies through the crystalline structure of the solids. Its rate depends \n\non the temperature, particle size and composition. There are two ways \n\nfor this kind of mechanism, as pointed by the paths 2 and 5 in Figure \n\n2.7. When vacancies flow from the neck to the particle surface (path 2) \n\nlattice diffusion does not contribute to densification. Although treated \n\ntheoretically, there is little evidence for this occurring at significant \n\nlevels. On the other hand, when vacancies come from the neck to the \n\ngrain boundary (path 5), the center-to-center approach of two particles is \n\ninduced and leads to system shrinkage. \n\nConsidering that the volume diffusion is active for most \n\nmaterials only at high temperatures (high activation energy), this is not \n\nthe dominant mass transport during sintering, especially for small \n\npowders [10]. \n\nGrain boundary diffusion (path 4 in Figure 2.7) is relatively \n\nimportant for sintering of most materials. Indeed, it is the leading \n\nmechanism in many cases. The defective character of the grain boundary \n\nallows mass flow along the boundary with an activation energy that lays \n\nusually between surface and volume diffusion. As surface area is \n\nconsumed and surface diffusion declines in importance, the \n\nsimultaneous emergence of new grain boundaries increases the role of \n\ngrain boundary. On the other hand, grain growth reduces the importance \nof grain boundary diffusion [10]. \n\nRegardless the transport mechanism, once the neck size reaches \n\na thermodynamic equilibrium among surface energy, dihedral angle and \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\ngrain boundary energy, further neck growth only occurs due to the grain \n\ngrowth [10]. \n\nTherefore, it is clear that mass transport rates, and their \n\ninfluence on neck growth and pores and grain size, are a key factor to \n\nunderstand the sintering process. Models for solid-state sintering usually \n\ntake into account surface diffusion (prevailing mechanism during initial \n\nstage) and grain boundary diffusion (dominant for intermediate stage). \n\nModeling of the final stage of sintering must consider grain growth to be \n\nrealistic [10]. \n\n \n\n2.4 DISCRETE ELEMENT METHOD \n \n\nSeveral industrial processes as well as many phenomena in \n\nnature involve particulate media. The discrete character of the medium \n\nresults in a complex behavior due to the dynamic interaction between \n\nparticles and their interaction with surrounding gas or liquid and walls \n\n[13]. Traditional theoretical and experimental investigations of the \n\nmechanical behavior of granular materials are restricted by the limited \n\nquantitative information about what actually happens internally in those \n\nsystems [14]. Alternatively, numerical simulations using particle length \n\nscale is possibly the most powerful tool to understand and reproduce the \n\nbehavior of such systems. \n\nCundall and Strack [13] have developed in 1979 a simulation \n\nmethod, originally to study rock mechanics, known as Discrete Element \n\nMethod (DEM). This technique takes into account the granular nature of \n\nthe material by treating every grain as a distinct element (particle). \n\nEvery particle interacts with the neighbors by means of contact and non-\n\ncontact (body) forces, and can move translationally and rotationally. \n\nNewton\u2019s equations of motion describe the particles dynamics. Thereby, \n\nDEM simulations can provide dynamic information, such as trajectories \n\nof particles and transient forces acting on individual particles, which is \n\nextremely difficult to obtain by physical experimentation at this stage of \n\ndevelopment [15].  \n\nIn contrast to the continuum methods, the discrete element \n\nmethod offers the advantage to have access to coordination number \n\n(number of contacting particles) and contact area of every grain. \nContinuum methods use phenomenological models that do not take into \n\nconsideration the microstructure of the material [16], such as effects due \n\nto grain rearrangement, of local heterogeneities and anisotropy. As \n\nexample, Figure 2.8 shows the particle mixing pattern induced by the \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\n \n\npassage of a single bubble through two initially completely segregated \n\nlayers of particles of different colors. For comparison issues, \n\nexperimental data are presented in Figure 2.8 (a), discrete method in (b), \n\nand continuum method in (c). Differences in the distribution of density \n\ncan be easily noted. The discrete model shows a good correspondence \n\nwith the experimental observations, whereas the continuum model \n\noverpredicts the mixing [17]. \n\nIn recent years, DEM has been rapidly extended to study several \n\nfields of engineering due to multiple efforts in the simulation technique \n\nand computational technology evolution. Examples of application are \n\nvibratory sphere packing [18], ball milling [19], sintering process [4], \n\nand even for fluidization, where DEM may be coupled with \n\ncomputational fluid dynamics [17]. A good review of DEM applications \n\nand findings has been done by Zhu et al. [15]. \n\n \nFigure 2.8: Mixing patterns of a colored under-layer of particles induced by \n\na single bubble: (a) experiment; (b) discrete method; (c) continuum method \n\n[17]. \n\n \n \n\nApplication of DEM to simulate sintering in three-dimensional \n\nsystems has become more frequent in the last decade. One of the first \n\nworks, Martin et al. (2006) [4] have simulated the sintering of copper \n\npowder at varying temperatures and proposed a grain-coarsening \n\nscheme. Prior to sintering, the samples were compacted isostatically or \n\nuniaxially in order to analyze whether the compaction technique can \n\ninfluence the sintering behavior. They have found that uniaxially \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\ncompaction induces anisotropy in the sample during sintering. The \n\nsimulations have shown a good accordance with the experimental data, \n\nmainly when coarsening scheme has been included. \n\nHenrich et al. (2007) [3] have simulated free and pre-assisted \n\nsolid-state sintering of powders with special attention to the grain \n\nrearrangements during sintering. The authors have described in details a \n\nmethod for generating a realistic initial configuration of particles. It has \n\nbeen found that the densification rate is enhanced by grain \n\nrearrangements, whereas bulk and shear viscosity are reduced. Grain \n\nrearrangement has also affected the crack formation. When a coefficient \n\nof friction has been included (imposing a resistance to the \n\nrearrangements), cracks have formed along the sample. \n\nSuch findings concerning evolution of cracks have been \n\nconfirmed by Martin et al. (2009) [20]. The authors have investigated \n\ndeeper the evolution of defects (cracks) during sintering in the \n\nunconstrained and constrained sample, with varying coefficient of \n\nfriction between particles. The authors\u2019 main conclusion has been that it \n\nis necessary to have some form of constraint to nucleate and/or grow \n\ncracks. Defects may nucleate and grow from localized heterogeneities \n\n(at the length of few particles) and the green density can influence in the \n\ndefect growth. \n\nWonisch et al. (2007) [21] have used DEM to study the stress-\n\ninduced anisotropy through sintering of alumina samples. The authors \n\nhave found that intergranular pores are preferentially orientated along \n\nthe compressive loading axis in accordance with their experimental \n\nobservation and with Martin et al.\u2019s work [4]. \n\nThe effect of particle size distribution on sintering has been \n\nstudied by Wonisch et al. (2009) [22]. The authors have simulated \n\nsamples with normal, lognormal and bi-modal size distribution, in which \n\nvarying width distribution was used. The main finding has been that the \n\ndensification rate declines when the distribution width increases, \n\nalthough particle rearrangement is enhanced.  \n\nThe effect of a substrate on the sintering of films has been \n\nstudied by Martin and Bordia (2009) [23]. The interaction between \n\nparticles and substrate has been modelled by viscous drag (friction). \n\nTheir work has shown that the substrate can induce heterogeneity and \nanisotropy along the film thickness in which was initially homogeneous \n\nand isotropic. The degree of anisotropy depends on the value of the \n\nviscosity at the interface. \n\nRasp et al. (2013) [24] has investigated the influence of varying \n\ninitial coordination number but similar green densities on the sintering \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\n \n\nbehavior. Their simulations have shown that the densification is strongly \n\nretarded in the case of low initial coordination numbers. \n\nConsidering sintering of composites using DEM simulations, \n\njust few works can be found in literature. In the earliest works aimed in \n\nthis topic, Jagota and Scherer (1993) [25, 26] have studied the sintering \n\nof monosized composites by varying the fraction of hard spheres and \n\nassuming that all contacts follow a linear viscous law. These authors \n\nhave concluded that there is an inclusion fraction limit (hard spheres) \n\nabove which the apparent viscosity of the packing increases drastically \n\ndepending on the nature of the contact between inclusions.  \n\nLater on, Olmos et al. (2009) [5] have investigated the sintering \n\nof mono-sized copper/alumina composites by varying the volume \n\nfraction of alumina inclusions (between 5% and 30%) and compared \n\nwith experimental data. Sintering has been carried out at temperature of \n\n1000 \u00b0C, which is reasonable to treat alumina particles as hard spheres. \n\nThe experiments have shown that the densification rate decreases as the \n\nfraction of inclusions increase. For the case of 30% alumina, the sample \n\nbarely has sintered since inclusions can form a continuous network \n\n(percolation) above this solid volume content, which hinders sintering. \n\nOverall, the simulations have shown a good agreement with the \n\nexperimental data. \n\nYan et al. (2013) [6] have investigated the effect of volume \n\nfraction, size and homogeneity (agglomerates) on the sintering behavior \n\nof ceramic/metal composites. Metal particles have been treated as soft \n\nspheres, and ceramic particles as hard spheres (sintering temperature at \n\n800 \u00b0C). The authors, in accordance with Olmos et al. [5] and Jagota and \n\nScherer [26], have found that the densification rate is reduced as the size \n\nof inclusions decrease. Furthermore, the simulations have shown that the \n\ndensification rate decreases as inclusion size decrease for a given \n\nvolume fraction. The same behavior has found for agglomerate of \n\ninclusions. The authors claim that agglomerates of fine inclusions may \n\nbe considered as larger particles of agglomerated total size. \n\nIn such works of composites sintering, the authors have used \n\nmodels considering one of the materials as rigid inclusions. It means that \n\njust one material sinters and the other follows, for example, an elastic \n\nlaw. However, whether sintering is carried out at a high enough \ntemperature, both materials can sinter and be treated as soft spheres.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\n2.5 MATHEMATICAL DESCRIPTION OF DEM \n \n\nIn the DEM scheme, the interactions of spherical particles are \n\naccounted by modeling the evolution of the packing as a dynamic \n\nprocess. The particles are described by their individual vectors: \n\nposition  ??? ?, velocity ???? ? and angular velocity ????? ?, and scalars: mass ??, \nmoment of inertia ??, and radius ??. These vectors are shown in Figure \n2.9, which represent two overlapped particles on a vectorial plane. This \n\nFigure represents the soft sphere approach in which the normal force ???? ? \n\nand the tangential force ???? ? can be observed. The overlap ? between \n\nparticles and the forces are discussed in the next chapter.  \n \n\nFigure 2.9: Two overlapped particles on a vectorial plane showing their \n\nvectors.  \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.10 shows a flowchart that represents the DEM \n\nalgorithm for the temporal evolution of the particles. As observed, in \n\neach simulation time step ?t, firstly the number of neighbors in contact \nof every particle is determined (Figure 2.10 a), where the Verlet-\n\nNeighbor List Method [27, 28] may be used. A pair of particles is \nconsidered in contact if the distance between their centers is less than \n\nthe sum of their radii. An example may be observed in Figure 2.9, where \n\n| ??? ? ? ??? ?|  &lt; ?? + ??, thus particles are considered in contact.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.10: Flowchart representing the DEM algorithm. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThen, after the neighborhood calculation, the algorithm goes \n\nthrough every particle (Figure 2.10 b). The forces between neighboring \n\nparticles are calculated (c) depending on a given force law (these forces \n\nare described in the next section). With the total force acting on the \n\nparticle and using the Newton\u2019s second law, it is possible to obtain the \n\nnew velocity and position [3]. The time evolution of the particle \n\npositions is governed by Newton\u2019s equation of motion, which provides \n\nthe balance of forces and moments, as follows: \n\n \n\ns \n\n?\n\n??\n??? ? = ???? ?,    ?\n\n?\n\n??\n???? ? = ???? ?\n\n??? = ? ???? ??\n???\n\n (2.3) \n\ns \n?\n?\n\n??\n????? ? = ???? ?\n\n??? = ? ???? ??\n???\n\n (2.4) \n\n \n\n???? ?\n??? denotes the total force acting on the ith particle, computed as the \n\nsum of all forces  ???? ??, and ???? ?\n???  the total torque acting on the ith particle. \n\nTime Step t = 1,2,\u2026,n \n\n Calculation of the Contact Forces with particle \n\nx \n\nStarting the temporal looping \n\nCalculation of Contact Neighbors for Every Particle \n\nLooping through all particles \n\nx ? m \n\nx = m \n\nt = n \n\nt ? n \n\nEnd \n\nBegin \n\nDEM Algorithm \n\n(\na) \n\n(\nb) \n\n(\nd) \n\n(\nc) \n\nParticle x = 1,2,\u2026,m \n\n \n\nIntegration of the Equations of Motion \n\n \n\nNew Particles Position and Velocity \n\n \n\n a) \n\nb) \n\nd) \n\nc) \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\nFor the time integration of these equations of motion, the \n\nLeapfrog Integration Method [29] may be used (Figure 2.10 d): \n \n\ns ??? ?(? + ??) = ??? ?(?) + ??  ???? ?(?) +\n?\n\n??\n(??)????? ?\n\n???

(2.7) \n\n \n\n2.6 CONTACT MODEL FOR SINTERING \n \n\nDEM simulations need a mathematical model that describes \n\nproperly the interaction forces between particles. Equation 2.8 shows the \n\nNewton\u2019s second law and forces that might act on ith particle [30]: \n\n \n\ns \n?\n\n?\n\n??\n ???? ? = ???? ?\n\n?\n+ ???? ?\n\n?\n+ ? ???? ??\n\n??\n\n???\n\n+ ? ???? ??\n?\n\n???\n\n (2.8) \n\nThe force ???? ?\n?\n results from the particle-fluid interaction, such as \n\ndrag force or due to the pressure gradient. In solid-state sintering, this \n\nsort of force does not exist due to the absence of fluid. The term \n\n???? ?\n?\n represents gravitational forces acting on the particles. Even though \n\ngravity is present during sintering, most works do not consider its \n\ncontribution [3, 4].  \n\n???? ??\n??  results from the non-contact force acting on particle ith by \n\nthe interaction with particle kth, such as the van der Waals or \n\nelectrostatic forces. Van der Waals forces play an important role to keep \n\nthe particles together in the green body, but do not affect the sintering \n\nbehavior.  \n\n???? ??\n?  represents contact forces that result when particle ith is \n\nphysically contacting particle kth. Examples of contact forces include \n\nfrictional forces, spring force and air resistance force. In DEM \n\nmodelling, this sort of forces acts on the point of contact between two \n\nparticles. Figure 2.11 shows a representation of two soft particles \n\ninteracting with an overlap ? and such point of contact is shown by the \ndotted line.  \n\nIn sintering, as discussed in the previous chapter, the mass \n\ntransfer for neck formation and densification only takes place at the \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\n \n\ncontacts of particles. Hence, a contact model that predicts realistically \n\nthe sintering behavior is necessary.  \n\n \nFigure 2.11: Contact geometry between two overlapped particles. \n\n \n \n\nIn this work, whose purpose is to simulate sintering of \n\ncomposites, a special approach is proposed based on Bouvard and \n\nMcMeeking's model [31] and the observations of Olmos et al. [5]. The \n\nmetal material is nickel (Ni) and the ceramic one is alumina (Al2O3). \n\nThree types of contacts coexist through the samples and are treated in a \n\ndifferent way (see Figure 2.12):  \n\n? between metal particles (Ni-Ni); \n\n? between ceramic particles (Al2O3-Al2O3); \n\n? between metal and ceramic particle (Ni-Al2O3). \n \n\nFigure 2.12: Contact geometry between two overlapped particles. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nThe three contacts have two different behaviors. Briefly, the Ni-\n\nNi and Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts are the sintering ones (Figure 2.12 a) and \n\nc)), described by a sintering-viscous model. The Ni-Al2O3 is a non-\n\nsintering contact (Figure 2.12 b) and follows a viscous model (described \n\nin details as follows).  \n\n(\n\na) \n\n(\n\nc) \n\n(\n\nb) \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n\nThe contact model for sintering is based on Bouvard and \n\nMcMeeking's model [31], which considers grain boundary and surface \n\ndiffusion as the main mechanisms of mass transport. As the simulations \n\nare carried out with a constant temperature  ?, the diffusion coefficient \nfor vacancy transport in the grain-boundary with thickness ?? is \ndescribed by Equation 2.9. ?? is the activation energy, ?? the ideal gas \n\nconstant and ??? pre-exponential factor. Diffusion coefficient is used to \ncalculate the diffusion parameter (Equation 2.10), where ? is the atomic \nvolume and ? the Boltzmann constant. \n\n \n\ns ?? = ?????? (\n???\n???\n\n) (2.9) \n\ns ??=  \n? \n\n??\n ???? (2.10) \n\n \n\nAs the simulations are carried out at 1220 \u00b0C, metal-metal and \n\nceramic-ceramic contacts are sintering. For such a case, given a system \n\nof two particles of identical radius ?, and an overlap ?, the normal force \n\n ???? ? (see Figure 2.9) acting at the contact is described by:  \n \n\ns ???? ? =  \n???\n\n?\n\n????,?\n ???? ???,? ? ? ?\n\n?\n\n?\n????,? (2.11) \n\n \n\nwhere ??,? is the surface energy and ??,? diffusion parameter of the \nmaterial, depending on which kind of contact is taking place. Contact \n\nradius ?? can be observed in Figure 2.11.  \nThe first term on the right-hand side of Equation 2.11 may be \n\nconsidered as a normal resistance that opposes the movement. Its value \n\ncan be either compressive or tensile, depending on the particle-particle \n\nrelative velocity in the normal direction  ???? ???,?. The second term relates \nto a sintering tensile force due to the surface energy ??. The vector ? ? is \nthe unit vector in the normal direction to the contact area between two \n\nparticles. This vector is necessary to convert the sintering term from a \n\nscalar into a vector. Note that the viscous term depends on the size of the \n\ncontact radius  ?? to the power of four, thus leading to very large \nresistance for large overlaps [20].  \n\nThe parameters ? and ? depend on the ratio of the grain-\nboundary ???? diffusion to the surface diffusion ???? [23], in the \nfollowing relation: \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ns ? =\n????\n????\n\n (2.12) \n\n \n\nwhere for a pair of particles ? = ? may be used for all values of  ?. The \nparameter ? = ?/? is used for ? = ?, ? = ? for ? = ?. ?, and ? =\n?/? for ? = ?. ??. In other words, it is possible to choose which \nmechanism would be the dominant throughout the simulation only \n\nchanging the parameter ?. As grain boundary diffusion is the most \nimportant mechanism to promote densification during sintering (see \n\nSection 2.3.4), it was chosen ? = ? (grain boundary twice more influent \nthen surface diffusion). Then, in the present work the used parameters \n\nare ? = ?/? and ? = ?. \n\nThe tangential contact force ???? ? represents a viscous resistance \nagainst sliding and opposes the particle-particle relative velocity in the \n\ntangential direction  ???? ???,?, is given by [32, 33]:  \n \n\ns ???? ? = ??????  \n???\n\n???\n\n????,?\n ???? ???,? (2.13) \n\n \n\nwhere ????? is a viscous parameter with no dimension. This coefficient \n\ncan be considered as a friction parameter for the sliding of particles, \n\nwhere surface rugosity and shape of the particles may affect its value. \n\nEven though its value is difficult to quantify experimentally, it has been \n\nshown to be of primary importance for the macro defect initiation [20]. \n\nMartin and Bordia [23] suggest that the value of the viscosity ????? \nshould be&lt;1, because the normal viscosity term in Equation 2.11 should \n\nbe of the same order or larger than the tangential viscosity term \n\n(Equation 2.13) when the normal and tangential relative velocities are of \n\nthe same order. Martin et al. [20] have investigated different values of \n\nthe viscosity parameter. They have found that for ????? > ?. ??, the \n\nrearrangements of particles are very restrict and crack formation can \n\noccur along the sample even without preexisting defects. For  ????? =\n\n?. ??, sintering has taken place with heterogeneous densification and \nwithout formation of large cracks. This value, as an intermediary value \nof viscosity, is used in this work. \n\nThe contact radius ?? is calculated by Coble's model [34]: \n\ns ??\n? = ??? (2.14) \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\nwhich is dependent of the overlap ? between the particles. It is \nimportant to point out that Coble\u2019s model considers the mass transfer to \n\nthe growing of the neck when two particles are approaching and \n\noverlapping each other. In other words, the contact radius  ?? calculated \ntakes into account the conservation of mass, as represented in Figure \n\n2.11. \n\nFor the contact between metal-ceramic (Ni-Al2O3), it is \n\nconsidered that no sintering takes place. The normal force for them has \n\nbeen adapted by the observations of Olmos et al. [5]. The authors have \n\nstudied experimentally the sintering with a mixture of copper and \n\nalumina. One of their results is that during sintering, at temperatures \n\ntypical for the metal phase but not sufficient for alumina, the metal \n\nparticles exhibit viscous deformation in the contact region to an alumina \n\nparticle. The shape of the contact region is, thereby, comparable to a \n\nsintering neck. To consider this viscous effect at the Ni-Al2O3 contacts, \n\nthe normal force is given solely by the viscous term in Equation 2.11, \n\nresulting in: \n\n \n\ns ???? ? =  \n???\n\n?\n\n????,?\n ???? ???,? (2.15) \n\n \n\nwhere ??,?  is calculated from the mean value between ceramic and \nmetal diffusion parameters.  \n\nFriction is also considered in metal-ceramic contacts and is \n\ncalculated by the tangential force in Equation 2.13, where  ????? = ?. ?? \n\nas well. \n\nIn order to study the effect of varying size of particles in the \n\npacking, samples with bimodal packings were generated and an \n\nequivalent radius  ?? is defined between two particles of radius ?? \nand ?? [23]: \n\n \n\ns ?\n? =\n\n?????\n(??+??)\n\n (2.16) \n\n \n\nwhere ? in Equation 2.11 and 2.13 can be replaced by ??. Many authors \n[20, 22] have used this generalization, which has its origin in elasticity \n\nand plasticity theory. Moreover, this is in good quantitative agreement \n\nwith numerical simulations carried out by Pan et al.[35] and Parhami et \n\nal. [36] on sintering behavior of two-spheres systems with size ratio of \n\nup to four. \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\n \n\n3 SIMULATION AND ANALYSIS METHODS \n \n\nAs first part of this project, this chapter presents the adjustments \n\nand developments done on the software MUSEN [37] in order to enable \n\nit to simulate sintering. The topics include a short description of the \n\nsoftware MUSEN, the main assumptions for sintering, the validation of \n\nthe sintering behavior with a system of two particles and a method \n\nproposed to calculate the density evolution.  \n\n \n\n3.1 SOFTWARE MUSEN \n \n\nSoftware MUSEN, developed by Dosta [37, 38], is a Graphical \n\nUser Interface (GUI) with implemented DEM equations, which can be \n\nused to simulate the sintering process with some adjustments. \n\nThe MUSEN system has an algorithm that generates packing of \n\nparticles with random distribution. The algorithm produces packings \n\ninside the simulation box, which is defined as a three dimensional space \n\nwith a specified geometry (cubic, spherical or cylindrical) where \n\nperiodic boundary conditions could be implemented to act on their \n\nborders. The algorithm to fill the simulation box is a dynamic method \n\nand works basically in three steps. Firstly, the number of particles is \n\ncalculated from the porosity required and the simulation box\u2019s volume. \n\nSecondly, this amount of particles is filled into the box occupying \n\nrandom sites and a small overlap is allowed between particles. Thirdly, \n\nthe particles are displaced on a dynamic way, in order to attain a better \n\narrangement of the particles and reduce the overlap between them. Then, \n\nit is possible to manipulate the packing, for example to delete particles \n\nor change their positions.  \n\nA mathematical model for diverse purposes can be implemented \n\nin the language C++ and loaded into the software. Different material \n\nproperties may be loaded and used for simulations. As output data, the \n\nsoftware provides a txt file with the particle\u2019s vectors position, velocity \n\nand force for each saved time step. On the graphical interface, the \n\nbehavior of the sample throughout the time can be observed in such a \n\nway that it allows observing crack formation, rearrangement of particles \n\nand densification.  \n\nThe features previously described are just some of the available \n\ntools in the software. Moreover, new developments and adjustments can \n\nbe done in order to improve the software capabilities. To enable the \n\nsintering simulation, the main adjustments developed for this project \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\nhave been the calculation of the coordination number (CN) (number of \n\nneighboring particle in contact with each particle), the average contact \n\nradius (ACR) evolution and the density evolution. For this purpose, it \n\nhas been developed an algorithm in Matlab\u00ae which reads the output txt \n\nfile with the particle vectors along the simulation provided by the \n\nsoftware and calculates the CN and the ACR evolution throughout the \n\nsimulation. In addition, the particles can be colored by the coordination \n\nnumber on the graphical interface. For the densification calculation, a \n\nnew method has been developed and implemented into the software, as \n\ndescribed in details in the next section. \n\nFigure 3.1 shows a chart resuming the input and output data \n\n(mostly related to the sintering parameters) of software MUSEN. The \n\nDEM algorithm (gray part) refers to the algorithm described in Section \n\n2.5 (Figure 2.9). Figure 3.2 shows a screenshot of MUSEN\u2019s interface \n\nwith a packing of copper particles. As is observed in this figure, the \n\nsoftware allows coloring particles by different characteristics, such as \n\nvelocities, angular velocity, diameter, material and coordination number.  \n\n \nFigure 3.1: Diagram showing the Software MUSEN\u2019s input and output \n\ndata. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMaterial Parameters \n\nAtomic volume, \n\nactivation energy, \n\nsurface energy, \n\nparticle radius, etc.  \n\nParticle properties  \n\nPosition, velocity, \n\nacceleration, stress, \n\ncoordination number. \n\nSample properties  \n\nCrack development, \n\ndensification, \n\nrearrangements of \n\nparticles, anisotropy. \n\nContact Model \n\n \n\n  Software MUSEN \n\nDEM Algorithm \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2: Screenshot of Software MUSEN\u2019s interface with a spherical \n\npacking of copper particles. \n\n \n \n\n3.2 ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE SINTERING SIMULATION  \n \n\nThe first part of this project consisted to define the basic \n\nassumptions to simulate the sintering process. As any simulation work, \n\nit is important that the assumptions simplify the problem but, at the same \n\ntime, do not affect the physical reality of the process. \n\nFor sintering, a usual assumption mentioned in many works [4, \n\n5] is to neglect the rotational motions of the particles. Martin et al. [39] \n\nhave stated that the rotational motions can be neglected for packings \n\nwith particle coordination number between 6 and 10. Such a value of \n\nCN is found in the sintering packings since its relative density is about \n\n64%. Thus, the torque and angular velocity calculation (Equations 2.4 \n\nand 2.7) are deactivated in the software MUSEN during sintering \n\nsimulation.  \n\nSoftware MUSEN allows generating packings with typical \n\nrelative density of green body from 55% to 64%. Hence, it is not \n\nnecessary to compact the sample and the sintering simulation can be \n\ncarried out as soon as the packing is generated. Furthermore, the \n\nsimulations have been performed at sintering constant temperature of \n\n1220 \u00b0C. \n\nGrain growth is not considered in this work because the model \n\nused (see Section 2.6) does not predict such behavior. For this reason, \n\nthe authors of most works [22, 23] have stopped their simulations at \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \n\nrelative density of 0.90; for that grain growth has a limited influence on \n\nthe process. In addition, a basic assumption of DEM simulations is that \n\ntwo neighboring contacts of one particle must not interact. Figure 3.3 \n\nrepresents such situation, where particles A and C start to interact after \n\nsome simulation time due to the large overlaps developed with particle \n\nB. In other words, when the overlap between two particles attains a \n\ncertain maximum value, the simulation is not valid anymore. This \n\nmaximum value of overlap also corresponds at relative density about \n\n0.90. Those authors have used such limiting relative density because \n\nthey have simulated only one material with one densification kinetics. It \n\nmeans that all overlaps (and the contact radius) between particles follow \n\nthe same kinetic.  \n\n \nFigure 3.3: Representation of two neighboring particles interacting.  \n\n                               \n \n\nHowever, for this work in which two materials with two \n\ndifferent kinetics are used, the limitation must be related to the contact \n\nradius evolution between these two phases (nickel-nickel contact and \n\nalumina-alumina contact) instead to the relative density. In order to find \n\nout at which average contact radius the simulations should be stopped, a \n\ncalibration has been done relating the normalized average contact radius \n\nto the relative density evolution as shown in Figure 3.4.  \n\nThe contact radius has been normalized by the particle radius to \n\nbe independent of the particle size. As observed, the normalized average \n\ncontact radius that corresponds to relative density of 0.90 is equal to \n\n0.65. Therefore, the limiting normalized contact radius is 0.65 and the \n\nsimulation must be stopped at this point. It is important to point out that \n\nthis evolution is neither dependent on the material nor on the number of \n\nparticles in the simulation box. It is essentially a geometric evolution \n\nand then can be used for both alumina-alumina and nickel-nickel \n\ncontacts. \n\n  \n\nC \n\nSimulation time  \n\n(\n\na) \n\n(\nb) \n\n(\n\nA \n\n(\n\nA \n(\n\nB \n(\n\nB \n\n(\n\nC \n\n(\n\nC \n\n(\n\nb) \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4: Evolution of the normalized average contact radius as function \n\nof the relative density. \n\n \n\n3.3 NUMERICAL EXAMPLE WITH A TWO-PARTICLE \nSYSTEM \n\n \n\nIn order to investigate the correct behavior of the calculations \n\nprovided by the software MUSEN according to the used contact model, \n\nFigure 3.5 shows a numerical example with two particles of radius 0.05 \n\n\u00b5m before simulation (a) and after 60 seconds of simulation (b) at \ntemperature of 1200 \u00b0C. For such example, typical alumina parameters \n\n[20] have been used and the time step equal to 10\n-4\n\n s. Table 3.1 shows \n\nall simulation parameters for this example. It should be pointed out that \n\nthe contact diameter shown in Figure 3.5 (b) (white arrow) is not the \n\ncontact diameter used for the calculations. Instead of that, it is used the \n\ncontact diameter given by Equation 2.14 (contact radius), which \n\nconsiders the conservation of mass during the process. \n\n  \n\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\n0.40\n0.45\n0.50\n0.55\n0.60\n0.65\n0.70\n\n0.60 0.63 0.66 0.69 0.72 0.75 0.78 0.81 0.84 0.87 0.90\n\nA\nv\n\ne\nra\n\ng\ne\n\n C\no\n\nn\nta\n\nct\n R\n\na\nd\n\niu\ns \n\n/ \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\nP\na\n\nrt\nic\n\nle\n  \n\nR\na\n\nd\niu\n\ns \n\nRelative Density \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\nTable 3.1: Simulation and alumina parameters for the numerical example. \n\nParameter Symbol Unit Value \n\nDensity ?? kg/m\u00b3 3950 \n\nAtomic volume ? m\u00b3 8.47\u00d710-30 \nSurface energy ??

(2009) [20]. \n\n \n\nAs simulation proceeds (Figure 3.5), some parameters of the \n\ntwo particles change (Figures 3.6 and 3.7). Figure 3.6 (a) shows the \n\nforces evolution, and Figure 3.6 (b) shows the evolution of the relative \n\nvelocity in normal direction. As expected from Equation 2.11, in Figure \n\n3.6 (a) the sintering force presents a constant value through the entire \n\nsimulation, whereas the viscous force presents a more complex \n\nbehavior. As discussed previously, this latter force is dependent on the \n\nrelative velocity in the normal direction   ????,? and, since the particles \nare initially stopped, it starts from zero. The curve of velocity in Figure \n\n3.6 (b) presents a similar behavior of the viscous force in (a).  \n\n \nFigure 3.5: Representation of two alumina particles before simulation (a) and \nafter 60 s of simulation (b). \n\n \n\nSimulation time \n\n(\n\na) \n(\n\nb) \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\n \n\nTo explain such behavior, it is necessary to analyze Equation \n\n2.11. In the first time step, since viscous force is zero, the only force \n\nacting on the particles is the tensile sintering force. Hence, there is a \n\nlarge total force attracting the particle, leading the development of high \n\nvelocities for the next time step. Then, such high velocities results in a \n\ngreat increase of the viscous force. On the other hand, the viscous force \n\ndeveloped will offer a resistance to the motion of the particles, which \n\nends up decreasing the velocities. In other words, the viscous force \n\ninduces influences and simultaneously it is influenced by the particle \n\nvelocities. This explanation may be supported by observing Figure 3.6 \n\n(b), where the relative velocity attains a maximum velocity at the same \n\ntime when the viscous force is maximum in (a). Moreover, it is observed \n\nthat the velocity does reach neither a constant value nor zero. For this \n\nreason, it can be considered that the particles attain a \u2018virtual\u2019 \n\nequilibrium. \n\nFigure 3.7 (a) shows the displacement of the particles as \n\nsimulation goes on and (b) shows the evolution of the contact radius \n\nbetween the particles. A great part of the total displacement occurs in the \n\nbeginning of the simulation, when the particles velocity is higher as it \n\nwas in Figure 3.6 (b).  \n\nIn Figure 3.7 (b), contact radius rises nearly similar to the \n\ndisplacement and it is in accordance with Coble\u2019s model in Equation \n\n2.14. \n\n \nFigure 3.6: The evolution of sintering and viscous force (a) and relative \n\nvelocity in the normal direction (b) of the pair of particles as simulation \n\nproceeds. \n\n \n \n\nThese results in Figures 3.6 and 3.7 are quite similar to those \n\nobtained by Nosewicz et al. [16], where the graphs of force, velocity and \n\ndisplacement have shown basically the same trend. Since the authors \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\nhave used the same contact model, it is a proof that the implementation \n\nof the contact model in the system has been done successfully.  \n\n \nFigure 3.7: The evolution of the displacement (a) and contact radius (b) of \n\nthe pair of particles as simulation proceeds.  \n\n \n \n\n3.4 DENSIFICATION CALCULATION THROUGHOUT THE \nSIMULATION \n\n \n\nSintering process is also known as a densification process. \n\nThus, it is extremely important to know how the evolution of the relative \n\ndensity occurs as simulation proceeds. For this reason, a method has \n\nbeen developed to calculate the densification curve throughout the \n\nsimulation. \n\nDensity ? is defined by  \n?\n\n?\n, where ? is mass and ? is volume. \n\nFor a particulate system, the relative density ?? of a specific volume ?? \nmay be calculated by the following equation: \n\n \n\ns ?? = ??\n????\n\n??\n (3.1) \n\n \n\nwhere ?? is the number of particles inside the volume, ?? is the \n\nmaterial density of the particles and ?? is the volume of each particle. \n\nThe great difficulty of this approach is to calculate the exact volume ?? \nof the system, since during sintering simulation the particles can move \n\nin an inordinate way due to the heterogeneities of random packings. \nFurthermore, symmetry is not present in many kinds of studied systems. \n\nTo solve this problem, an alternative has been proposed as \n\nfollows. First of all, a spherical volume ?? with radius ?? and position \nvector ?? is defined, where the density will be calculated. Figure 3.8 (a) \nshows a cubic packing of particles generated by the software, whereas \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\n \n\n(b) is the same cube but cut in the central plane (the particles are hidden) \n\nand such spherical volume ?? can be seen with the gray lines.  \nSecondly, an algorithm goes through every particle ith in the \n\nsystem with a radius ?? and position vector ?? and checks whether the \nparticle is inside, outside or within the border of the spherical volume. \n\nFor the calculation, the following geometrical cases must be considered: \n\n \n\nCase 1) particle is outside the sphere:          |?? ? ??|  ?  ?? + ?? \n\nCase 2) particle is inside the sphere:            |?? ? ??| + ?? ?  ??  \n\nCase 3) particle is within the border and: \n\nCase 3.1) particle\u2019s center outside the border: \n\n?? &lt;|?? ? ??|  &lt; ?? + ?? \n\nCase 3.2) particle\u2019s center inside the border: \n\n?? ? ?? &lt;|?? ? ??|  &lt; ?? \n\n \n\nFigure 3.8: Random cubic packing of particles (a) and the same sample but \n\ncut in the central plane and with a spherical volume defined by the gray \n\nlines where the density is calculated (b). \n\n \n \n\nCase (1) and case (2) are more trivial to be solved. In case (1), \n\nthe particle is not considered. In case (2) the total volume of the particle \n\nis taken into account for the density calculation. Case (3) is more \n\ncomplex to deal with because the particle\u2019s partial volume inside the \n\nspherical volume must be calculated. For such a case, a solution \n\nregarding the intersection between two spheres has been used. Figure \n\n3.9 represents the spherical cap with height ? of a sphere with radius ?. \nThe volume of the spherical cap is given by: \n\n(\n\na) \n\n(\n\nb) \n\n(\n\nb) \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n\ns ???? =\n??2\n\n3\n(3? ? ?) (3.2) \n\n \n\nFigure 3.10 (a) shows the case (3.1), where the particle\u2019s center \n\nis outside of the spherical volume. The partial volume inside the \n\nspherical volume is the sum of the orange and green volumes. The \n\nvolume of the green part is calculated as a cap of the big sphere with \n\nheight ?, whereas orange part is calculated as a cap the small sphere \nwith height ?. \n\n \nFigure 3.9: Representation of spherical cap. \n\n \n \n\nThen, the partial volume inside the spherical volume for the \n\ncase (3.1) is given by: \n\ns ???????? = ????????? +  ?????????? (3.3) \n\nFigure 3.10 (b) shows the case (3.2), where the particle\u2019s center \n\nis inside of the spherical volume. The partial volume inside the spherical \n\nvolume is calculated slightly different. The volume (blue + yellow) \n\n?????? is calculated as a cap of the small particle with a height (? + ?). \n\nThe volume of the yellow ????? part is calculated as a cap of the big \n\nsphere with height ?.  \n  \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.10: Representation of two overlapped spheres with the smallest \n\nparticle\u2019s center outside the border (a) and inside the border (b). \n\n \n \n\nThen, the partial volume inside the spherical volume for the \n\ncase (3.2) is given by: \n\ns ???????? = ?????? ? ?????? +  ????? (3.4) \n\nwhere ?????? is the total volume of the small particle.  \nThereby, the partial volumes can be calculated and the density \n\n?? in such spherical volume ?? is given by: \n \n\ns ?? = ?????????\n[(????)??????\n\n+ ? ????????\n?\n\n? ]\n\n??\n (3.5) \n\n \n\n(\n\na) \n(\n\nb) \n\n(\n\nb) \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\nwhere ?? is the number of particles entirely inside of the spherical \n\nvolume, ?? is the total volume of one particle and ????????\n?  is the partial \n\nvolume of every particle ith that is within the border of the spherical \n\nvolume. \n\nFigure 3.11 shows an example of the relative density evolution \n\nof a cubic packing of alumina particles calculated by the procedure \n\npreviously described. The behavior of this densification curve is quite \n\nsimilar to the theoretical curve showed in Figure 2.6 (Section 2.3.3) and \n\nit is a confirmation that the developed method calculates the \n\ndensification correctly. \n\n \nFigure 3.11: Relative density evolution over time of a cubic packing filled \n\nby alumina particles. \n\n \n \n\n0.6\n\n0.65\n\n0.7\n\n0.75\n\n0.8\n\n0.85\n\n0.9\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120\n\nR\ne\n\nla\nti\n\nv\ne\n\n D\ne\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n \n\nTime (s) - (Simulated time) \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\n \n\n4 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE  \n \n\nBefore proceeding with the simulations, the packing of particles \n\nshall be generated and it should match some initial criteria: \n\nhomogeneous and isotropic random packing of spheres, realistic \n\ncoordination number and relative density for a green body. \n\nThe numerical samples for this work have been generated by the \n\nsoftware MUSEN\u2019s algorithm of packing generation (see Section 3.1), \n\nwhich produces samples that satisfy the previous requirements. For all \n\nsamples, a simulation box with a spherical geometry has been chosen, \n\nand the particles are randomly distributed through the packing. The \n\nmaximum number of particles has been established to about 4000 \n\nparticles. Unfortunately, a limitation of DEM is the number of particles \n\nsimulated, which could lead to a prohibitive computational time. \n\nHowever, Henrich et al. [3] have stated that few thousands of particles \n\nare enough to have a good compromise between acceptable computing \n\ntime and reliable results.  \n\nA common configuration used in DEM works are the periodic \n\nboundary conditions on the simulation box. This configuration allows an \n\ninfinite lateral length to be represented, in which a particle that reaches \n\nthe boundary of the simulation box will interact with the particle on the \n\nopposite side. However, due to the complexity of this configuration, it \n\nhas not been implemented for the presented simulations. Thereby, a few \n\nsimulations with a larger number of particles in the sample have been \n\ncarried out in order to proof that the lack of periodic boundary \n\nconditions do not affect the overall results. \n\n \n\n4.1 NUMERICAL SAMPLES \n \n\nThe numerical samples are divided into two groups:  \n\n? monosized packing; \n\n? bimodal packing. \n \n\nThe monosized packings have been generated in order to investigate \n\nthe influence of varying volume fractions of each material (alumina and \nnickel) on the sintering behavior. Thus, eight numerical samples with \n\nparticle diameter of 100 nm have been produced with varying \n\ncompositions. Table 4.1 describes these samples. Packings composed by \n\npure alumina and pure nickel have been also produced to be used as \n\nreference. There are three kinds of structures among the samples and \n\n\n\n68 \n\n \n\nthey are shown in the last column: matrix system (pure material), \n\nmatrix-particulate system and interpenetrating structures.  The initial \n\nrelative density of these packings is equal to 0.62. This relative density \n\nis below the random close packing limit of 0.64 [22] and it is a typical \n\nvalue for initial relative density used in DEM simulation of sintering [3, \n\n4]. Figure 4.1 (a) shows a screenshots of the initial spherical packing \n\ngenerated by software MUSEN with 80% of nickel volume fraction and \n\n(b) shows the numerical sample with nickel volume fraction of 40%. \n\nNote that blue particles represent alumina and gray represent nickel. \n\n \nTable 4.1: Data of monosized samples representing alumina and nickel \n\ncomposite. \n\nSample \n\nVolume \n\nFraction \n\nNickel \n\n(%) \n\nVolume \n\nFraction \n\nAlumina \n\n(%) \n\nParticle \n\ndiameter \n\n(nm) \n\nNumber \n\nof \n\nParticles \n\nKind of Structure \n\n100% 100 0 100 3987 Matrix (pure metal) \n\n90% 90 10 100 3987 Matrix-Particulate \n\n80% 80 20 100 3987 Matrix-Particulate \n\n60% 60 40 100 3987 Interpenetrating \n\n40% 40 60 100 3987 Interpenetrating \n\n20% 20 80 100 3987 Matrix-Particulate \n\n10% 10 90 100 3987 Matrix-Particulate \n\n0% 0 100 100 3987 Matrix (pure ceramic) \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1: Screenshot of numerical sample with nickel volume fraction of \n\n80% (a) and 40% (b) generated by software MUSEN. \n\n  \n\nAlumina \n\nParticle \n \n\n \nNickel \n\nParticle \n\n(\n\na) \n(\n\nb) \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4.2 describes the data of the monosized samples with \n\nhigher number of particles.

The metallic \n\nmaterial chosen for this work was nickel, whereas the ceramic one was \n\nalumina. These materials have been chosen because their physical \n\nparameters are available in literature [5, 20] and, in fact, it is not easy to \n\nobtain them experimentally. Parameters such as activation energy for \n\ngrain-boundary diffusion would need methods more complex to \n\ncalculate them, for example quantum mechanism. The estimation of \n\nthese parameters is out of scope of this project. \n\nTable 4.4 lists the physical parameters [5, 20] for both materials \n\nrequired by the contact model used (Equations 2.9; 2.10; 2.11 and 2.13).  \n\n \nTable 4.4: Physical parameters for nickel and alumina used in the \n\nsimulations. \n\nParameter Symbol Nickel Alumina Unit \n\nMelting point ?? 1455 2072 \u00b0C \nDensity ?? 8912 3950 kg/m\u00b3 \n\nAtomic volume ? 1.18\u00d710-29 8.47\u00d710-30 m\u00b3 \n\nSurface energy ?? 1.72 1.1 J/m\u00b2 \nGrain boundary \n\nthickness times  \n\ndiffusion parameter \n\n???0? 5.12\u00d710\n-15\n\n 1.3\u00d710\n-8\n\n m\u00b3/s \n\nActivation energy ?? 105 475 kJ/mol \nSource: Martin et al.

For the present work, the temperature has been chosen at \n\n1220 \u00b0C. Nickel and alumina particles in this size can sinter at this \n\ntemperature, even though nickel has a higher potential to sinter whether \n\ncompared to alumina. This conclusion may be justified at Table 4.4, \n\nbecause the nickel melting point is lower than alumina. It leads to a \n\nbetter atomic motion for nickel at the sintering temperature (diffusion \n\nparameter; see Equation 2.9 and 2.10). Moreover, nickel has a higher \n\nvalue of surface energy that results in larger values for sintering force in \n\nEquation 2.11.  \n\nTable 4.5 lists other parameters related to the simulation, such \n\nas time step, saving time step and sliding friction coefficient (discussed \n\nin Section 2.5, Equation 2.13). \n\n\n\n72 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nTable 4.5: Simulation parameters chosen for this work. \n\nParameter Symbol Unit Value \n\nSliding friction coefficient \n\n(tangential force) \n????? - 0.01 \n\nTemperature ? \u00b0C 1220 \n\nTime step ?? s 1\u00d710-7 \nSaving time step ????? s 1\u00d710\n\n-2\n \n\n \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \n\n \n\n5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\nIn this chapter we present the main results obtained along this \n\nproject, as well as their interpretation. The results are divided into three \n\nparts. In the first part we show the simulations results of the monosized \n\npacking samples. Secondly, the results of the bimodal packings are \n\nexposed. The third part consists in a short presentation of the results \n\nwith packings of larger number of particles. \n\n \n\n5.1 MONOSIZED PACKINGS\n1\n \n\n \n\nIn this section we present and discuss the results about the \n\nsimulations of the monosized packings with the varying contents of \n\nnickel and alumina. Firstly, it is presented the average contact radius \n\nevolution of the three kinds of contacts (nickel-nickel, alumina-alumina \n\nand nickel-alumina). Then, the average coordination number evolution \n\nis presented for the three kinds of contacts. Lastly, the global \n\ndensification curves of all samples are shown and discussed. In order to \n\nclarify and support some explanations given along this section, some \n\nimages of the samples after the simulation are also exhibited. \n\nBefore starting to present the results, it is important to recall the \n\nconcept of interpenetrating systems and matrix-particle systems (see \n\nSection 2.1.1) in order to explain the different structures present in the \n\nsamples. For particulate systems with monosized packings, matrix-\n\nparticle structures are considered when the volume fraction of one \n\nmaterial is less than 30%. The particles are either isolated or form small \n\nagglomerates, and can be treated as inclusions. Contents higher than 30 \n\nvol.% form a percolated network of particles that are called \ninterpenetrating structures. Thus, in the samples with 90 vol.% and 80 \n\nvol.%, the nickel particles may be considered as the matrix phase and \n\nthe alumina particles as inclusions. The samples 60 vol.% and 40 vol.% \n\ncan be considered as interpenetrating structures. The samples with 20 \n\nvol.% and 10 vol.% alumina particles can be considered as matrix and \n\nthe nickel particles as inclusions. Thereby, it is possible to expect \n\ndifferent behaviors from these different structures as sintering proceeds. \n\n \n\n_______________________________________________________ \n1\n This part of the dissertation was partially published in: \n\nJournal of the European Ceramic Society, v. 36, p. 2245-2253, 2016. \nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955221915303101  \n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955221915303101\n\n\n74 \n\n \n\n \n\n5.1.1 Average Contact Radius Evolution \n \n\nAs discussed in Section 3.2, the simulations must be stopped \n\nwhen the normalized average contact radius of particles attains 0.65 of \n\nthe particle radius. However, due to the different sintering kinetics of \n\nnickel and alumina, the contact radius evolution of nickel-nickel, \n\nalumina-alumina and nickel-alumina contacts should be analyzed \n\nseparately. All graphs concerning average contact radius (ACR) shown \n\nin this section are normalized by particle radius (?) to provide \ngenerality of the simulation results. The samples are referred by their \n\nvolume fraction of nickel (%). \n\n \n\n? Nickel-Nickel contacts \n \n\nFigure 5.1 shows the ACR evolution for nickel-nickel (Ni-Ni) \n\ncontacts of the samples with nickel volume fraction of 100%, 90%, \n\n80%, 60%, 40%, 20% and 10% over the simulation time. First of all, a \n\nquite similar behavior of all samples over the time is clearly observed. \n\nAt the time zero (before the simulation), the ACR of all samples is about \n\n0.003/?. Then, within the first time steps of simulation, there is an \nabrupt increase of the ACR. After ?? = 0.02?, the ACR growth is \nsmoother and with an asymptotic behavior it reaches 0.65/? at about \n\n ?? = 0.40?.  \nIt is possible to observe a small difference between the curves \n\nof 100 vol.%, 90 vol.% and 80 vol.%, to the others. In these samples, \n\nalumina particles are treated as inclusions. Due to the lower sintering \n\npotential of alumina phase, its addition in metal-matrix composites tends \n\nto retard sintering and, consequently, delays Ni-Ni contact radius \n\ngrowth.  \n\nOther important aspect of this work is the simulation time \n\nshown in ? axis. Indeed, this time is the \u201creal time\u201d, the time that these \nsamples would take to sinter in real life. One might say that 0.4 seconds \n\nis quite fast to sinter any sample. However, it is important to observe the \n\nsintering conditions. The particles have 100 nm of diameter. Within this \n\nsize range, they have a very high surface energy and high potential to \n\nsinter [40\u201343]. Moreover, the samples have less than 4000 particles. It \n\nmeans that the total sample diameter has few ?m of diameter, i.e., it is a \n\nvery small sample, which would take few seconds to be sintered. In \n\naddition, it is important to observe that when the simulation starts, the \n\n\n\n75 \n\n \n\n \n\ntemperature is at the highest sintering temperature. There is no heating \n\nup phase for such situation. Therefore, at time zero the sintering \n\ntemperature is the highest one for the process and equal to 1200 \u00baC. This \n\ntemperature is quite high to sinter nickel, since its melting point is equal \n\nto 1455 \u00baC (see Table 4.4, Section 4.2), and could be expected that \n\nnickel sinters quite fast. \n\n \nFigure 5.1: Average contact radius evolution (normalized by particle \n\nradius) for nickel-nickel contacts of the monosized packings over time. The \n\nsamples are referred to by the volume fraction of nickel. \n\n \n \n\n? Alumina-Alumina contacts \n \n\nFigure 5.2 shows the ACR evolution for alumina-alumina \n\n(Al2O3-Al2O3) contacts of the samples with nickel volume fraction of \n\n90%, 80%, 60%; 40%, 20%, 10% and 0% (pure alumina) over the \n\nsimulation time. Initially, these samples have the ACR about 0.003/?. \nThen, most of the ACR increase occurs within the earliest time steps and \n\nthen it follows a smoother increase until attains about 0.3/? at  ?? =\n0.40?.  \n\nAlong the simulations, the curves behavior for all samples is \n\nnearly the same and the alumina content only influences the sample 90% \n\nand 80%. In fact, the sample 90% has a more apparent increase. The \nhigh content of metal phase in this sample promotes high forces pulling \n\nthe system to shrink and ends up transferring forces to sinter alumina \n\nparticles.  \n\n\n\n76 \n\n \n\nLikely, the same behavior takes place for the sample 80%. \n\nHowever, the forces provided by nickel particles are more distributed \n\nthrough alumina ones and its effect is less pronounced. These \n\naffirmations are discussed in more detail in the next sections. \n\n \nFigure 5.2: Average contact radius evolution (normalized by particle \n\nradius) for alumina-alumina contacts of the monosized packings over time. \n\nThe samples are referred to by the volume fraction of nickel. \n\n \n \n\n? Comparison between Ni-Ni and Al2O3-Al2O3 contact radius \nevolution \n \n\nComparing Figure 5.1 and 5.2, a noticeable difference is \n\nobserved in the ACR growth between Ni-Ni and Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts. \n\nThe ACR for Ni-Ni contacts is more than twice the value of Al2O3-\n\nAl2O3 contacts at  ?? = 0.40?. As stated in Section 4.2, this behavior \nmight be expected since nickel has a higher value of surface energy and \n\ndiffusion parameter if compared to the alumina ones. These parameters \n\nlead to higher forces attracting Ni-Ni contacts and the contact radius \n\ngrows faster. Therefore, an important conclusion is that ACR growth of \n\nNi-Ni contacts is the limiting point for the simulations, since Ni-Ni \n\ncontacts reach 0.65/? before Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts. Consequently, the \nsimulations are not valid after  ?? = 0.40? and all simulations shall be \nstopped at the point where Ni-Ni contacts reached value of 0.65/?. \n\nAnother implication of the higher ACR growth of Ni-Ni \n\ncontacts is that nickel particles induce higher sintering forces through \n\nthe system and faster densifications. This conclusion is discussed in \n\n\n\n77 \n\n \n\n \n\nmore detail in the next sections and can be confirmed by the \n\ndensification curves in Section 5.1.4 further on.  \n\nFurthermore, it is possible to observe a slight variation in ACR \n\ngrowth of Ni-Ni and Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts only for the samples 80% and \n\n90%. These samples are characterized as nickel-matrix composites and \n\nthe alumina particles (with lower sintering potential) are considered \n\ninclusions. Then, alumina particles tend to retard the growing contact \n\nradius of Ni-Ni contacts. On the other hand, the nickel phase tends to \n\ndensify the system with a high sintering force and, as consequence, to \n\ntransfer forces to the alumina particles due to the particulate nature of \n\nthe system.  \n\nFor the samples of nickel volume fraction of 60%, 40%, 20% \n\nand 10%, the Ni-Ni and Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts are not affected by the \n\nother phase. It means that nickel and alumina phases sinter separately \n\nfrom each other in these samples. \n\n \n\n? Nickel-alumina contacts \n \n\nFigure 5.3 shows the ACR evolution for nickel-alumina (Ni-\n\nAl2O3) contacts of the samples with nickel volume fraction of 10% to \n\n90% over the simulation time. Moreover, the nickel-nickel contact \n\nevolution of pure nickel sample (100%) and alumina-alumina contact of \n\npure alumina sample (0%) are also plotted for comparison criteria.  \n\nAnalyzing the Ni-Al2O3 contacts evolution in Figure 5.3, all \n\nsamples show an ACR growth within the first time steps. From about \n\n?? = 0.01? on, the Ni-Al2O3 contacts start showing the ACR evolution \ndependent on the nickel content. For the samples 90%, 80% and 60%, \n\nthe ACR growth increases as the nickel volume fraction increases. The \n\neffect of the nickel content shows stagnation for the sample 40%, 20% \n\nand 10%, whose ACR evolution follows that of the pure alumina Al2O3-\n\nAl2O3 contacts. Comparing to the pure nickel Ni-Ni contact, the Ni-\n\nAl2O3 contacts of all samples show slower ACR growth. \n\nTo explain the behavior of Ni-Al2O3 contacts, it is necessary to \n\nremember Equation 2.15 that defines the normal force acting between \n\nthese contacts. As discussed in Section 2.5, there is no sintering force \n\nattracting Ni-Al2O3 particles. The normal force is defined only by \nviscous force that acts to oppose the current motion of the particles. \n\nHowever, the whole system is shrinking due to the sintering force acting \n\nbetween Ni-Ni and Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts. Then, Ni-Al2O3 particles tend \n\nto approximate and overlap each other as an indirect effect of the \n\n\n\n78 \n\n \n\nsintering force shrinking the sample. At the same time, the viscous force \n\nbetween Ni-Al2O3 contacts acts to hinder the approximation motion of \n\nthese particles.  \n\n \nFigure 5.3: Average contact radius evolution (normalized by particle \n\nradius) for nickel-alumina contacts of the monosized packings over time. \n\nThe samples are referred to by the volume fraction of nickel. The alumina-\n\nalumina contacts from the sample 0% and nickel-nickel from sample 100% \n\nare shown as reference. \n\n \n \n\nFurthermore, it was stated previously that nickel particles \n\ninduce higher sintering forces to the system due to the faster ACR \n\ngrowth than alumina. From this conclusion, one may consider that there \n\nis a higher total force pulling the system to shrink when a higher content \n\nof nickel is present in the sample. Thus, higher nickel volume fraction \n\nresults in higher total force shrinking the system and the effect of the \n\nviscous force between Ni-Al2O3 contacts are less pronounced. In other \n\nwords, the effect of the viscous force between Ni-Al2O3 contacts is \n\nreduced as the nickel content increases. This occurs due to the higher \n\ntotal forces promoted by higher nickel contents in order to shrink to \n\nsystem.  \n\nThis explanation can be easily understood mainly for the \n\nsamples 90 vol.% and 80 vol.%. In these samples, the alumina particles \n\nare essentially isolated particles and surrounded by nickel particles. \nThus, the Ni-Al2O3 contacts suffer higher influences from the nickel \n\nbehavior (higher densifications). For the samples 40 vol.%, 20 vol.% \n\nand 10 vol.%, the higher alumina content promotes weaker sintering \n\nforces through the system and the Ni-Al2O3 contacts essentially follow \n\n\n\n79 \n\n \n\n \n\nthe ACR growth of the Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts. Even though the sample \n\n60 vol.% is considered as an interpenetrating structure, the higher nickel \n\ncontent influences slightly the Ni-Al2O3 contacts and its ACR growth is \n\na bit higher than the samples 40 vol.%, 20 vol.% and 10 vol.%.  \n\nOnce again, it is important to remember that this explanation \n\nabove is supported by the densification curves further on. \n\n \n\n5.1.2 Average Coordination Number Evolution \n \n\nCoordination number (CN) of each particle is defined as the \n\nnumber of neighboring particles in contact. As sintering proceeds, due to \n\nthe shrinkage of the system and the rearrangement of the particles, CN \n\ntends to increase along the process. For a mixture of two materials, CN \n\nis an important parameter, which is related to the homogeneity of the \n\nparticle distribution. Thus, CN of the three kinds of contact shall be \n\nanalyzed separately since their evolution along sintering is not the same.  \n\nIt is important to point out that the average CN presented in this \n\nwork shows slightly smaller values if compared to those presented in \n\nsome works in literature [20, 22]. This is because no periodic boundary \n\nconditions were implemented for the numerical samples. Thereby, the \n\nparticles on the packing border have lower CN and this reduces the \n\naverage. Furthermore, in order to confirm that the lack of boundary \n\nconditions is not affecting the results, few simulations with a larger \n\nnumber of particles have been carried out and are presented in a section \n\nforward. \n\n \n\n? Nickel particles with nickel contacts \n \n\nFigure 5.4 shows the average coordination number (ACN) \n\nevolution for nickel particles with nickel contacts (Ni?Ni) of the \n\nsamples with nickel volume fraction of 100%, 90%, 80%, 60%, 40%, \n\n20% and 10% over the simulation time. Before the simulations, ACN of \n\nall samples is smaller than 3.5 and it decreases as the nickel content \n\ndecreases. Once the sintering has started, ACN increases along the \n\nsimulation, as expected. Overall, ACN growth is higher as the nickel \n\ncontent increases. \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n80 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.4: Average coordination number evolution for nickel particles \n\nwith nickel contacts of the monosized packings over time. The samples are \n\nreferred to by the volume fraction of nickel. \n\n \n \n\nFor the samples 20 vol.% and 10 vol.%, there is a small ACN \n\ngrowth within  ?? = 0.02? and then the curves are virtually constant \nuntil the end of the simulation. Within the first time steps, every Ni-Ni \n\ncontact close to each other is formed and this configuration continues \n\ndue the low nickel content. \n\nFor the samples 40 vol.% and 60 vol.%, there is a sudden ACN \n\ngrowth within  ?? = 0.02? and then the curves grow slightly until the \nend of the simulation. This behavior is due to the interpenetrating \n\nstructures. Even though the nickel particles have a limited number of \n\nnickel neighbors in such structures, the continuous network of particles \n\nallows the development of new Ni-Ni throughout the whole process. \n\nFor the samples 80 vol.%, 90 vol.% and 100 vol.%, an abrupt \n\nACN growth takes place within  ?? = 0.02?. Thereafter, it continues \nclearly increasing as the simulation proceeds. This increase is higher as \n\nthe nickel content increases. Such a behavior is rather different if \n\ncompared to the sample with nickel content lower than 80 vol.%. As \n\nnickel particles are considered the matrix for these systems, many new \n\nNi-Ni contacts are developed along the whole sintering process. \n\n \n\n? Alumina particles with alumina contacts \n \n\nFigure 5.5 shows the ACN evolution for alumina particles with \n\nalumina contacts of the samples with nickel volume fraction of 90%, \n\n80%, 60%, 40%, 20%, 10% and 0% over the simulation time. Initially, \n\n\n\n81 \n\n \n\n \n\nthe sample 0 vol.% has ACN of 3.4 and the value decreases as the \n\nalumina content decreases. As the simulation proceeds, ACN of all \n\nsamples naturally increases. This increase is higher as the alumina \n\ncontent increases.  \n\nFor the sample 90 vol.% and 80 vol.%, the alumina particles are \n\nessentially isolated and have a limited number of neighboring alumina \n\nparticles to develop new Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts. ACN increase for these \n\nsamples is very small during the whole process.  \n\nFor the samples 60 vol.% and 40 vol.%, ACN increase of \n\nAl2O3-Al2O3 is more noticeable due to the continuous network of \n\nalumina particles.  \n\n \nFigure 5.5: Average coordination number of alumina particles with alumina \n\ncontacts of the monosized packings over time. The samples are referred to \n\nby the volume fraction of nickel. \n\n \n \n\nFor the samples 20 vol.%, 10 vol.% and 0 vol.%, the alumina \n\nparticles represent the matrix phase, which have many neighboring \n\nalumina particles to develop new Al2O3-Al2O3 contact through the \n\nwhole simulation. Nevertheless, most of the ACN increase occurs within \n\nabout  ?? = 0.05?. After that, the ACN increase is very slight. \n \n\n? Comparison between Ni-Ni and Al2O3-Al2O3 coordination \nnumber evolution \n \n\nComparing Figures 5.4 and 5.5, it is possible to realize some \n\nsimilarities and some differences. In general, the increase of ACN for all \n\n\n\n82 \n\n \n\nsample of both Ni-Ni and Al2O3-Al2O3 have the highest increase within \n\nthe earliest simulation time. This is because there are higher forces \n\npulling the system to shrink in the beginning of the process. Thus, most \n\nof the possible contacts are developed with neighboring particles in the \n\nbeginning. \n\nFirst of all, a comparison is made for ACN evolution of isolated \n\nparticles (Al2O3-Al2O3 of 90 vol.% and Ni-Ni of 10 vol.%; Al2O3-Al2O3 \nof 80 vol.% and Ni-Ni of 20 vol.%). For both pair of samples, the \n\nbehavior is practically the same. It means that these four samples can \n\nreally represent matrix-particle systems. \n\nFor the interpenetrating systems, ACN growth is also essentially \n\nthe same, when comparing Ni-Ni contacts of the sample 60 vol.% with \n\nAl2O3-Al2O3 contacts of the sample 40 vol.% and Ni-Ni contacts of the \n\nsample 40 vol.% with Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts of the sample 60 vol.%. \n\nOn the other hand, visible distinction may be observed when the \n\nACN evolution of the matrix phase is compared. The ACN growth of \n\nNi-Ni contacts when nickel is the matrix phase (samples 100 vol.%, 90 \n\nvol.% and 80 vol.%) is higher than Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts when alumina \n\nis the matrix (samples 0 vol.%, 10 vol.% and 20 vol.%). It means that \n\nmore Ni-Ni contacts are developed along the process when nickel is the \n\nmatrix if compared to the Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts when alumina is the \n\nmatrix. This is another effect and confirmation that nickel particles \n\npromote higher sintering forces and faster shrinkage of system.  \n\n \n\n? Nickel particles with alumina contacts \n \n\nFigure 5.6 shows the ACN evolution of nickel particles with \n\nalumina contacts (Ni?Al2O3) for the samples with nickel volume \n\nfraction of 90%, 80%, 60%, 40%, 20% and 10% over the simulation \n\ntime. The ACN evolution of Ni-Ni contacts for pure nickel sample \n\n(100%) and Al2O3-Al2O3 contact for pure alumina sample (0%) are also \n\nplotted by comparison issue. Note that it is being analyzed in Figure 5.6 \n\nthe average number of alumina particles contacting each nickel particles. \n\nIt is not the same than ACN of alumina particles with nickel contacts. \n\nThe results would be completely different. For this reason, this \n\nparameter is referred as Ni?Al. \nConsidering Ni?Al2O3 contacts, ACN increases as the alumina \n\ncontent increases. It means that there are more alumina particles \n\nsurrounding (and contacting) the nickel particles when higher alumina \n\ncontent is present in the sample. ACN increase for all samples is quite \n\n\n\n83 \n\n \n\n \n\nsmaller than for both Ni-Ni contacts of pure nickel sample and for \n\nAl2O3-Al2O3 contacts of pure alumina sample. \n\n \nFigure 5.6: Average coordination number evolution for nickel particles \n\nwith alumina contacts of the monosized packings over time. The samples \n\nare referred to by the volume fraction of nickel. The alumina-alumina CN \n\nfrom the sample 0% and nickel-nickel CN from sample 100% are shown as \n\nreference. \n\n \n \n\nFor the samples 10 vol.% and 20 vol.%, ACN increase is more \n\nnoticeable within about  ?? = 0.15? and then its increase is smoother. As \nin these samples the nickel particles are mostly surrounded by alumina \n\nparticles, several contacts may be developed by nickel particles with \n\nalumina. \n\nFor the samples 90 vol.% and 80 vol.%, ACN increase is very \n\nslight during the whole simulation and can be considered constant for \n\nsuch a case. The few alumina contacts of the nickel particles are already \n\nformed in the beginning of the process and the low alumina content does \n\nnot allow new Ni?Al2O3 contacts to be developed. \n\nEven though the number of interfaces between nickel and \n\nalumina should be higher for the samples 60 vol.% and 40 vol.%, ACN \n\nincrease of Ni?Al2O3 does not follow a behavior that one might expect. \n\nThis occurs due to the interpenetrating structures of the phases and its \n\neffect during sintering. The nickel and alumina phase densify \n\nindependently from each other for the samples 60 vol.% and 40 vol.%. It \n\nmeans that nickel particles tend to approach other nickel particles and \n\nthe same happens with alumina. This situation is more pronounced for \n\nthe sample 60 vol.% where only few new Ni?Al2O3 contacts are \n\n\n\n84 \n\n \n\ndeveloped. Due to the higher alumina content in sample 40 vol.%, more \n\nNi?Al2O3 contacts are developed during the simulation, although the \n\nbehavior described before is also present. \n\n \n\n5.1.3 Visual Analysis of the Monosized Samples  \n \n\nIn order to visualize the different sintering behaviors discussed \n\nin Sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.2, Figure 5.7 shows screenshots of the sample \n\n80 vol.% (matrix-particles structures) and 60 vol.% (interpenetrating \n\nstructures). Figure 5.7 (a) shows the sample 80 vol.% before the \n\nsimulation and (b) after the simulation. Figure 5.7 (c) shows the sample \n\n60 vol.% before the simulation and (d) after the simulation. In these \n\nscreenshots, a cross section of the samples is shown at the middle of axis \n\n? (see the coordinate axes) to visualize inside the packing. The gray \nparticles represent nickel, whereas blue particles represent alumina. Note \n\nthat the green lines represent the initial size of the spherical simulation \n\nbox.  \n\nIn Figures 5.7 (a) and (b), it is possible to observe that the \n\nwhole sample of 80 vol.% shrinks along the simulation. The edges of the \n\nsample move away considerably from the initial simulation box size. \n\nIndeed, this is a qualitative (visual) confirmation that this sample is \n\ndensifying. Furthermore, as nickel is the matrix phase for such a case, \n\nthe nickel phase probably controls the densification throughout the \n\nsintering process.  \n\nOn the other hand, the sintering behavior of the sample 60 \n\nvol.% in Figure 5.7 (c) and (d) is rather distinct. The final distance of the \n\nsample borders to the initial simulation box size is less pronounced than \n\nin the sample 80 vol.%. It is observed that nickel particles are highly \n\ndensified with large contact radius developed between Ni-Ni contacts \n\nthrough the continuous network of particles. Meanwhile, the alumina \n\nparticles are barely densified and the Al2O3-Al2O3 contact radius is quite \n\nsmall. This is in agreement with the average contact radius evolution for \n\nNi-Ni and Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts shown in Section 5.1.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n85 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.7: Screenshots of the numerical samples during sintering: (a and b) \n\ninitial and final configuration of the sample 80 vol.% of nickel; (c and d) \n\ninitial and final configuration of the sample 60 vol.% of nickel.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nStill in Figure 5.7 (d), several empty spaces can be seen among \nnickel-alumina interfaces due to the high attraction between Ni-Ni \n\nparticles. This supports the low increase of the ACN for Ni?Al2O3 \n\nshown in Figure 5.6 for the sample 60 vol.%. Moreover, grain growth \n\nshould occur among nickel particles from that point of the simulation on \n\n(\n\na) \n(\n\nb) \n\n(\n\nc) \n(\n\nd) \n\nSample 60 vol.% \n\nof nickel \n\nSimulation time - Shrinkage \n\nSample 80 vol.% \n\nof nickel \n\n(\n\nb) \n\n(\n\nd) \n\n\n\n86 \n\n \n\n(?? = 0.40?) to simulate the process realistically, as discussed \npreviously.  \n\nThese qualitative statements about Figure 5.7 are supported \n\nquantitatively by the densification curves in the next section. \n\n \n\n5.1.4 Global Densification  \n \n\nFigure 5.8 shows the global relative density (RD) evolution of \n\nthe monosized samples with nickel volume fraction of 100%, 90%, 80%, \n\n60%, 40%, 20%, 10% and 0% over the simulation time. It is observed \n\nthat RD increases for all samples along the process. However, RD \n\nincrease for the samples with nickel volume fraction lower than 80% is \n\nvery small and completely different whether compared to the samples \n\n100 vol.%, 90 vol.% and 80 vol.%. \n\n \nFigure 5.8: Global relative density evolution of all monosized samples over \n\ntime. The samples are referred to by the volume fraction of nickel. \n\n \n \n\nObserving Figure 5.8, the relative density evolution of the \n\nwhole sample is highly dependent of sample composition. The sample \n\nwith pure nickel (100 vol.%) shows the highest RD increase among all \n\nsamples. As there are no alumina particles to retard the densification, the \n\nsample follows the nickel sintering kinetics.  \n\nComparing the samples of pure nickel (100 vol.%) and pure \n\nalumina (0 vol.%), the nickel shows a faster densification evolution than \n\nalumina. It confirms that the nickel parameters lead to higher total forces \n\nto shrink and densify the system during sintering. \n\n\n\n87 \n\n \n\n \n\nComparing the samples 90 vol.% and 80 vol.% with the sample \n\n100 vol.% (nickel-matrix composite), the RD growth is reduced as the \n\nalumina content increases. As discussed previously (see Section 2.5), \n\nnickel and alumina contacts are not sintering and solely viscous forces \n\ndescribe their contacts. Thereby, alumina particles offer a resistance for \n\nthe shrinkage of the system and this resistance is higher as the alumina \n\ncontent increases. Moreover, it should be recalled that the samples 90 \n\nvol.% and 80 vol.% represent matrix-particle system, where nickel is the \n\nmatrix phase. For this reason, the nickel particles are able to drive the \n\nshrinkage of the whole system and proceed with the densification. \n\nFor the samples 60 vol.%, 40 vol.%, 20 vol.%, 10 vol.% and 0 \n\nvol.%, RD evolution is very slight and virtually the same. RD of these \n\nsamples increases only from 0.62 to about 0.66 at  ?? = 0.4?. The \ndensification of these samples is essentially controlled by the alumina \n\nkinetics. \n\nThis statement can be more easily understood for the samples \n\n10 vol.% and 20 vol.%. These two samples are considered matrix-\n\nparticle system, where alumina phase is the matrix. Thus, the alumina \n\nphase drives the shrinkage of the packing. The resistance imposed by the \n\nnickel particles is very slight and can be neglected for such a case. \n\nAs discussed in the last sections, the nickel and alumina phase \n\nsinter separately from each other through the interpenetrating structures \n\n(samples 60 vol.% and 40 vol.%). Furthermore, it was shown that the \n\naverage contact radius growth (see Section 5.1.1) of nickel is rather \n\nfaster than the alumina one, resulting in different densification kinetics. \n\nThus, while the continuous network of nickel particles is in advanced \n\nstage of the sintering, the alumina one is many steps back. Thereby, \n\nglobally the samples 60 vol.% and 40 vol.% shall present the \n\ndensification of the system basically controlled by the slowest kinetic \n\nstep. In this case, this is the alumina phase. \n\nThe findings described in this section are in line with those \n\npresented in the sections about average contact radius evolution, average \n\ncoordination number evolution and qualitative analysis of the sample \n\n(Sections 5.1.1, 5.1.2 and 5.1.3, respectively).  \n\n \n\n5.1.5 Samples with Higher Number of Monosized Particles \n \n\nSimulations of monosized samples with larger number of \n\nparticles have been carried out in order to proof that the lack of periodic \n\nboundary conditions is not affecting the simulation results and the main \n\n\n\n88 \n\n \n\nconclusions. The nickel volume fraction is the same of the smaller \n\nsamples (pure nickel, nickel volume of 90, 80, 60, 40, 20 and 10% and \n\npure alumina) but the number of particles is four times higher (~16,000 \n\nparticles in each sample). \n\nFigure 5.9 shows global relative density evolution of all larger \n\nmonosized samples over the simulation time. Note that the simulation \n\ntime is longer than for the smaller samples. Thus, it is possible to \n\nconclude that the trends are valid even for longer simulation times. \n\n \nFigure 5.9: Global relative density evolution of all monosized samples with \n\n16,000 particles over time. The samples are referred to by the nickel volume \n\nfraction. \n\n \n \n\nComparing Figures 5.9 and 5.8 (RD evolution of the larger and \n\nsmaller samples, respectively), it is confirmed that the boundary \n\nconditions do not affect the overall results. The trend of the curves are \n\nessentially the same, in which pure nickel shows the highest RD \n\nevolution, followed by the sample of 90 and 80 vol.%. In addition, one \n\nmay realize the retarded densification of samples 60 and 40 vol.%, \n\nwhich is slightly more pronounced here.  \n\n \n\n5.1.6 Discussion of Monosized Packings  \n \nThe monosized packing results presented along this chapter can \n\nbe divided into two categories. Firstly, some general trends are \n\ndiscussed. The highest growth of the average contact radius and the \n\ncoordination number occurred within the beginning of the simulation, \n\nregardless the type of contact (Ni-Ni, Al2O3- Al2O3 or Ni-Al2O3). Such a \n\n\n\n89 \n\n \n\n \n\nbehavior is explained by the high potential of the particles to sinter at the \n\ninitial step, when no viscous forces exist to provide a resistance for \n\nsintering. This was explained in Section 3.4 (Figures 3.6 and 3.7), in \n\nwhich high forces were observed pulling the particles together and \n\nresulting in high velocities. Therefore, simulations of metal-ceramic \n\ncomposites are also following this expected behavior of samples with \n\none phase. \n\nDue to the substantial difference between sintering potential of \n\nnickel and alumina material, it was needed to outline which phase would \n\ndefine the stopping point for the simulation. Nickel particles have higher \n\nsurface energy and diffusion parameter and sinters quite faster than \n\nalumina particles. Ceramic particles barely densified as metal particles \n\nalready reached the final relative density of 90% (represented by the \n\ncontact radius of 65% of the particles radius). This is clearly observed in \n\nACR charts (Figure 5.1 and 5.2). Thus, nickel particles define when the \n\nsimulation must be stopped. \n\nBeyond these general behaviors found for all samples, there are \n\nsome related to the content of metal and ceramic phase. From this point \n\nof view, the results can be divided into three groups: metal-matrix \n\ncomposite, ceramic-matrix composite and interpenetrating structure.  \n\nFor the nickel-matrix composites (samples 80%, 90% and 100% \n\nvolume of nickel), the sintering is driven by the nickel kinetics. It is \n\nimportant to remember that in matrix-particulate composite materials \n\nwithin this range of content, ceramic phase is added as hard inclusions \n\nand has the purpose to reinforce the composite [7]. Typically, ceramic \n\nphase (such as alumina) has lower sintering activity than the metal one \n\nand, thereby, its addition into metal-matrix sample as inclusions retards \n\ndensification [5]. From this knowledge, the densification curve (Figure \n\n5.8) shows the pure metal sample with the highest densification rate and \n\nit decreases as the alumina content is increased.  \n\nAdditionally, the sample of 90 vol.% shall be analyzed \n\nindividually. In this volume content (10%) the alumina particles are \n\nessentially isolated particles. This content is enough to reduce the \n\ndensification, even though the final relative density is comparable to the \n\npure metal sample. These findings are in line with the simulation results \n\nof Martin et al. [20] and experimentally derived results of Olmos et al. \n[5] as well as of Nakada and Kimura [44]. Those authors claim that rigid \n\nparticles in a matrix retard the sintering leading to longer sintering time \n\nbut still comparable relative densities.  \n\n\n\n90 \n\n \n\nWhen the ceramic content is increased to 20%, the alumina \n\nphase is not isolated as inclusions anymore. Here, they form small \n\naggregates and agglomerates (see Figure 5.7 a). As shown in Figure 5.4, \n\nthe coordination of Ni-Ni is reduced and, consequently, the sintering \n\npotential is restrained as well. Once again, this result is in agreement \n\nwith Yan et al.\u2019s work [6], in which the authors varied the content of \n\ninclusions.  \n\nNevertheless, the alumina agglomerates in the sample 80% are \n\nsintering as well. Analyzing the evolution of ACR for the Ni-Al2O3 \ncontact (Figure 5.3), one can recognize a relatively high value for \n\nnickel\u2013matrix composites. This evolution of ACR between nickel and \n\nalumina particles is promoted by forces acting on these contacts. As the \n\nnickel particles drive the system and promote densification, they \n\ndevelop new contacts with other nickel particles as well as with alumina \n\nparticles. Because of the particulate structure of the system, the sintering \n\nforces are distributed to all contacting particles. \n\nThe second group of results is the alumina-matrix composites, \n\nwhich considered samples with nickel volume of 10%, 20% and pure \n\nalumina (sample 0%). As exposed previously, alumina has a lower \n\nsintering activity than nickel and the global densification of them is very \n\nsmall (only ~4%). Indeed, sintering of alumina particles occurs only \n\nslightly. One might say that the sample is just creating necks but not \n\ndensifying. This observation is in agreement with experimental \n\nobservations of sintering of submicron alumina particles at 1200 \u00baC [45]. \n\nAt the temperature used in the simulation (1200 \u00baC), it would be \n\nnecessary much longer simulation time to reach comparable relative \n\ndensities for such samples. One possible suggestion would be to increase \n\nthe time step. However, this alternative is not valid here because the \n\nnickel parameters defined the maximum time step for the simulation and \n\nits increase would lead to numerical instability.  \n\nThe last group is the interpenetrating structure (samples nickel \n\nfraction 40 and 60 vol.%). The global densification of them is very small \n\nand basically follows the alumina kinetics. Looking at Figures 5.7 c) and \n\nd), it can be observed that the nickel and alumina phases form a \n\ncontinuous network of particles. The densification of each phase occurs \n\nseparately. As the metal particles already reached the densification of \n90%, alumina particles are only at 66%. Since there are many contacts \n\nbetween metal and ceramic phase, several defects (cracks) are developed \n\nthrough the sample and the initial configuration is destroyed.  \n\n \n\n\n\n91 \n\n \n\n \n\n5.2 BIMODAL PACKINGS \n \n\nIn this section, the results concerning the simulations of the \n\npackings with varying nickel particle size are presented and discussed. \n\nThe first part shows the average contact radius evolution for nickel-\n\nnickel, alumina-alumina and nickel-alumina contacts. Then, the \n\ncoordination number evolution is presented for the three kinds of \n\ncontacts as well. Finally, the global relative density evolution for all \n\nbimodal samples is presented and compared. Beyond the bimodal \n\npackings, the monosized packing with nickel volume fraction of 60% \n\n(the same content than the bimodal packings) is also presented along this \n\nsection for comparison criteria. This sample is referred to as particle size \n\nratio 1.0. \n\nIt is important to recall that the nickel volume fraction is equal \n\nto 60% for all samples, which means that they are interpenetrating \n\nstructures. Furthermore, the simulation box size has been kept constant \n\nand it leads to the reduction of the number of nickel particles as the \n\nnickel particle size increase (see Table 4.2 in Section 4.1).  \n\n \n\n5.2.1 Average Contact Radius Evolution \n \n\nThe average contact radius (ACR) is the limiting point for the \n\nsimulation of bimodal packing as well as it was for the monosized \n\npacking. The three kinds of contacts (nickel-nickel, alumina-alumina \n\nand nickel-alumina) are analyzed separately due to their different \n\nevolution. Their respective particles radius ? normalizes the ACR of \neach sample. The bimodal samples are referred to by the ratio of their \n\nnickel particle radius to the alumina particles radius.  \n\n \n\n? Nickel-nickel contacts \n \nFigure 5.10 shows ACR evolution for nickel-nickel (Ni-Ni) \n\ncontacts of the samples with particle radius ratio of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and \n\n3.0 over the simulation time. First, a noticeable influence of the particle \n\nradius is observed on the ACR growth. Note that the simulation time in \n\nthis Figure is rather longer (?? = 5.0?) if compared to that one used to \nsimulate the monosized packings (?? = 0.40?). \n\nAnalyzing Figure 5.10, ACR growth of Ni-Ni contacts is clearly \n\nslower as the particle size increases. This behavior is quite well \n\ntheoretically established since smaller particles have higher total surface \n\n\n\n92 \n\n \n\nenergy and induce higher driven force for sintering (see Section 2.3.1.2). \n\nMoreover, such a behavior can be also understood by the normal force \n\nacting between Ni-Ni contacts (Equation 2.11 in Section 2.5). The \n\nsintering term in this equation increases linearly as the particle radius \n\nincreases. On the other hand, the viscous term increases as the contact \n\nradius increases in the fourth power. As larger particles develop larger \n\ncontact radius, the viscous term (resistance) opposing the approximation \n\nmotion of these particles is higher. Therefore, the normal force acting to \n\nattract a pair of particles is smaller for larger particles.  \n\n \nFigure 5.10: Average contact radius evolution (normalized by particle \n\nradius) for nickel-nickel contacts of the bimodal packings over time. The \n\nsamples are referred to by the nickel-alumina particle size ratio. \n\n \n \n\nAs consequence of these different kinetics caused by the \n\nparticles radius, the simulation time to attain the limiting point (0.65/?) \nincreases as the particles radius increases. While sample 1.0 (monosized \n\npacking 60 vol.%) reaches the limiting point at ?? = 0.4?, the bimodal \nsample 1.5 does at about ?? = 1.8?. The samples 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 do not \nreach the limit contact radius within the simulation time carried out of \n\n?? = 5.0?. The final ACR reached by these samples is higher as the \nparticle radius ratio decreases. It should be pointed out that the increase \n\nin time is not linear due to the relation in the fourth power of the contact \nradius, as stated previously. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n93 \n\n \n\n \n\n? Alumina-alumina contacts \n \n\nFigure 5.11 shows the ACR evolution for alumina-alumina \n\ncontacts (Al2O3-Al2O3) of the samples with particle radius ratio of 1.0, \n\n1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 over the simulation time. \n\n \nFigure 5.11: Average contact radius evolution (normalized by particle \n\nradius) for alumina-alumina contacts of the bimodal packings over time. \n\nThe samples are referred to by the nickel-alumina particle size ratio. \n\n \n \n\nNo difference is observed in Figure 5.11 in ACR growth of \n\nAl2O3-Al2O3 contacts for these samples, as expected. Since the alumina \n\nparticles have the same size in all samples, the growth kinetic of ACR is \n\nthe same. Furthermore, as the number and size of alumina particles are \n\nthe same in the monosized and bimodal samples, these curves are in \n\naccordance with those obtained by the ACR growth of Al2O3-Al2O3 \ncontact for the monosized packing (Figure 5.2 in Section 5.1.1).  \n\n \n\n? Comparison between Ni-Ni and Al2O3-Al2O3 contact radius \nevolution \n \n\nIn order to compare the ACR growth of Ni-Ni and Al2O3-Al2O3 \n\ncontacts, Figure 5.12 shows the curves of both contacts. Only one curve \n\nof Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts is plotted (sample 3.0) since these contacts are \n\nessentially the same for all samples (see Figure 5.10). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n94 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.12: Comparison of the average contact radius evolution \n\n(normalized by particle radius) of Ni-Ni and Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts of the \nbimodal packings over time. The samples are referred to by the nickel-\n\nalumina particle size ratio. \n\n \n \n\nAnalyzing Figure 5.12, ACR growth of Ni-Ni contacts reduces \n\nand tends to approximate to the Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts curve as the nickel \n\nparticles size increases. However, the ACR growth of the largest nickel \n\nparticle (sample 3.0) is faster than the alumina one. Nevertheless, one \n\nmay expect that for a certain nickel particle size, the ACR growth of Ni-\n\nNi contacts would became slower than alumina. This proposition could \n\nbe tested for further works with the particles size ratio at most 4.0 times \n\nlarger. This is because the generalization used in this work (see Equation \n\n2.16 in Section 2.5) for bimodal pair of particles is valid up to this limit. \n\nTherefore, it is concluded that nickel has the fastest sintering \n\nkinetic and determines the limiting point of the simulations for the size \n\nratio used in this work. \n\n \n\n? Nickel-alumina contacts \n \n\nFigure 5.13 shows the ACR evolution for nickel-alumina (Ni-\n\nAl2O3) contacts of the samples with particle size ratio of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, \n\n2.5 and 3.0 over the simulation time. The Al2O3-Al2O3 evolution of the \n\nsample 3.0 is also plotted by comparison criteria.  \n\nObserving the ACR growth of Ni-Al2O3 contacts, one might \n\nrealize a certain tendency. Considering the sample 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0, the \n\nincrease of ACR is slower as the nickel particle size increases. The \n\n\n\n95 \n\n \n\n \n\nevolution for the samples 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 are quite similar and can be \n\nneglected for such a small variation. \n\n \nFigure 5.13: Average contact radius evolution (normalized by particle \n\nradius) for nickel-alumina contacts of the bimodal packing over time. The \n\nsamples are referred to by the nickel-alumina particle size ratio. \n\n \n \n\nThe behavior of the samples 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 can be an effect of \n\nthe weaker forces promoted by larger nickel particles, which was \n\ndiscussed previously in this section. Thus, the total force shrinking the \n\nsystem is smaller when larger particles are present and the effect of the \n\nviscous forces acting between Ni-Al2O3 (see Equation 2.13 in Section \n\n2.5) is more pronounced. \n\nWhen compared to the Al2O3-Al2O3 contact radius evolution, \n\nNi-Al2O3 contacts with particle size ratios larger than 2.0 show slower \n\nACR growth. It means that the global influence caused by larger nickel \n\nparticles is less pronounced. \n\n \n\n5.2.2 Average Coordination Number Evolution \n \n\nThe coordination number may show a substantial variation due \n\nto the particle size increase. Thus, the average coordination number \n\n(ACN) of the bimodal samples is analyzed separately for each kind of \n\ncontact: nickel particles with nickel contacts, alumina particles with \n\nalumina contacts and nickel particles with alumina contacts. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n96 \n\n \n\n? Nickel particles with nickel contacts \n \n\nFigure 5.14 shows the ACN evolution for nickel particles with \n\nnickel contacts (Ni?Ni) of the samples with particle size ratios of 1.0, \n\n1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 over the simulation time. Note that the highest value \n\nof the ACN is 5. As expected, ACN increases for all samples and it \n\noccurs within the earliest simulation times.  \n\n \nFigure 5.14: Average coordination number evolution for nickel particles \n\nwith nickel contacts of the bimodal packing over time. The samples are \n\nreferred to by the nickel-alumina particle size ratio. \n\n \n \n\nComparing the samples 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5, it is possible to \n\nobserve a tendency. The increase of ACN is smaller as the particles size \n\nincreases. The reason for such a behavior is the reduction of the total \n\nnumber of nickel particles as the particle size increases (see Table 4.2 in \n\nSection 4.1). As discussed previously, in order to keep the simulation \n\nbox size constant and at the same time increase the nickel particle size \n\n(for the same volume fraction), it is necessary to reduce to number of \n\nnickel particles. Thus, larger nickel particles have less nickel neighbors \n\nto develop contacts and the ACN decreases.  \n\nHowever, the sample 3.0 does not follow the behavior \n\npreviously described in Figure 5.14. This sample shows an increase of \n\nACN higher than the sample 2.0 and 2.5, and close to the sample 1.5. \n\nLikely, this is because the nickel particles are not so homogeneously \n\ndistributed through the sample 3.0, as it can be seen in the cross-section \n\nof this sample in Figure 5.14. This sample has only 92 nickel particles. \n\nFor such a small number of particles, any small heterogeneity \n\n\n\n97 \n\n \n\n \n\n(unavoidable in random packing of particles) might cause these \n\ndifferences in the coordination number.  \n\n \nFigure 5.15: Cross-section of the sample 3.0. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n? Alumina particles with alumina contacts \n \n\nFigure 5.16 shows the ACN evolution for alumina particles with \n\nalumina contacts of the samples with particle size ratio of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, \n\n2.5 and 3.0 over the simulation time. Once again, the highest value of \n\nthe ACN is 5.  \n\nIn Figure 5.16, ACN increases for all samples as simulation \n\nproceeds and it occurs within the earliest simulation times. This increase \n\nis higher as the nickel particle size increases, though the differences are \n\nvery slight. The reason for this behavior is related to the spatial \n\ndistribution of nickel and alumina volumes through the bimodal \n\nsamples. As already reported, the nickel particles size has been \n\nincreased to the same volume fraction. Hence, the same nickel volume \n\nthat was widely spread through the monosized sample is in turn \n\nclustered in the larger particles. In other words, the nickel volume spatial \n\ndistribution decreases as the particle size increases. Meanwhile, alumina \n\nparticles are also more clustered as the nickel particle size increases and \n\nhave more neighboring alumina to develop more Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts. \n\nThis explanation is supported by the samples screenshots in the next \n\nsection. \n\n \n\n\n\n98 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.16: Average coordination number evolution for alumina particles \n\nwith alumina contacts of the bimodal packing over time. The samples are \n\nreferred to by the nickel-alumina particle size ratio. \n\n \n \n\n? Nickel particles with alumina contacts \n \n\nFigure 5.17 shows the ACN evolution for nickel particles with \n\nalumina contacts (Ni?Al) of the samples with particle size ratios of 1.0, \n\n1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 over the simulation time. In this case, the highest \n\nvalue on the ACN is 15.  \n\nLooking at Figure 5.17, large differences can be observed for \n\nthe ACN evolution of Ni?Al2O3 along the simulations. The increase of \n\nACN is higher as the nickel particle size increases. Indeed, the distance \n\nbetween pairs of close curves is higher as the particle size increases. The \n\nexplanation for such a behavior is due to the ratio between the particles \n\nsize. Larger nickel particles have larger surface area. It means that they \n\nhave superficial space to develop larger number of contacts for a given \n\nsize of alumina particles. This behavior is rather evident and it should be \n\nexpected. Nevertheless, it is important to note that it is shown the \n\naverage of the coordination number. If the total number of Ni?Al2O3 \n\ncontacts was presented instead the average, it would be smaller the \n\nlarger nickel particles.  \n\nIn fact, this behavior related to the ACN of Ni?Al2O3 is very \nimportant to the overall sintering behavior. It may explain an unexpected \n\nbehavior found in the global densification, which is explored in the next \n\nsections. \n\n \n\n\n\n99 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.17: Average coordination number evolution for nickel particles \n\nwith alumina contacts of the bimodal packing over time. The samples are \n\nreferred to by the nickel-alumina particle size ratio. \n\n \n \n\n5.2.3 Visual Analysis of the Bimodal Packings \n \n\nFigure 5.18 shows screenshots of the bimodal samples before \n\nand after the simulation in order to analyze the samples qualitatively. \n\nThe smallest and the largest particles size ratio are shown. Figure 5.18 \n\n(a) shows the sample of ratio 1.5 before the simulation and (b) after the \n\nsimulation (?? = 2.0?). Figure 5.18 (c) shows the sample of ratio 3.0 \nbefore the simulation and (d) after the simulation (?? = 5.0?). These \ndifferences in the final simulation time are due to the difference contact \n\nradius growth in these samples (see Figure 5.10 in Section 5.2.1). The \n\nscreenshots show a cross section of the samples at the middle of axis ? \n(see the coordinate axes) to visualize inside the packing. The gray \n\nparticles represent nickel whereas blue particles represent alumina \n\nparticles. Note that the green lines represent the initial size of the \n\nspherical simulation box. \n\nIn Figure 5.18 (a) it is observed that the sample of ratio 1.5 has \n\nnickel and alumina particles well distributed all over the packing. \n\nComparing to the sample of ratio 1.0 (monosized samples 60 vol.% in \n\nFigure 5.7 (c) in Section 5.1.3), it is possible to notice the spatial \ndistribution of volume changes in ratio 1.5 due to the larger nickel \n\nparticles, as discussed in the last section. In Figure 5.17 (b), the edges of \n\nthe sample move away slightly from the initial simulation box size. \n\nHence, small densification should be expected.  \n\n\n\n100 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.18: Screenshots of the bimodal samples during sintering: (a and b) \n\ninitial and final configuration of the sample with particle size ratio 1.5; (c \n\nand d) initial and final configuration of the sample with particle size ratio \n\n3.0.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\nWhen the ratio 3.0 is analyzed in Figure 5.18 (c), the variation \nin the spatial distribution of volume is even more pronounced. The \n\nalumina particles are clearly clustered since the same nickel volume is \n\ndistributed through larger particles. Moreover, a higher number of \n\nalumina is observed surrounding larger nickel particles, as exposed in \n\nthe coordination number of Ni?Al2O3 contacts (see Figure 5.16). The \n\n  \n\na) \n\nSample of particle \n\nsize ratio 3 \n\nSample of particle \n\nsize ratio 1.5 \n \n\n(c) \n\n(\n\nd) \n\n(\n\nc) \n\nSimulation time - Shrinkage \n\n \n\n \n\n(d) \n\nb) \n\n\n\n101 \n\n \n\n \n\nsample after the simulation (d) shows a noticeable distance of edges \n\nfrom the simulation box size. It means that the sample is shrinking \n\nduring the simulation.  \n\nComparing the samples 1.5 and 3.0 (Figure 5.18) to the sample \n\n1.0 (Figure 5.7 (c) and (d) in Section 5.1.3), some substantial differences \n\ncan be observed. The sintering behavior changes even though the nickel \n\ncontent is identical. While nickel and alumina particles sinter \n\nindependently from each other in the sample 1.0, the densification can \n\nbe noticed in a global manner in the samples 1.5 and 3.0. Those big \n\nempty defects (cracks) formed in the sample 1.0 throughout the \n\nsimulation are not present in the final samples 1.5 and 3.0. As discussed \n\nin Section 5.2.1, smaller nickel particles have higher forces attracting \n\neach other. Thereby, larger nickel particles do not develop such high \n\nforces to cluster themselves and then alumina particles can keep \n\nattached by means of the viscous forces. Therefore, larger nickel \n\nparticles densify more slowly but at the same time are able to \u201ccarry\u201d \n\nalumina together and promote the densification globally. \n\nThese conclusions are supported by the quantitative analyses in \n\nthe following section. \n\n \n\n5.2.4 Global Densification  \n \n\nFigure 5.19 shows global relative density (RD) evolution of the \n\nbimodal samples with particle size ratio of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 over \n\nthe simulation time.  \n\nAs expected, RD increases for all samples along the process. In \n\nthe beginning of the simulation a great portion of the densification \n\noccurs due to the rearrangements and low viscous forces between pairs \n\nof particles. This behavior is in accordance with the sintering theory (see \n\nSection 2.3.3). The densification curves in Figure 5.19 are similar to \n\nthose in Figure 2.6. \n\nFurthermore, it is possible to notice a tendency in Figure 5.19. \n\nThe increase of the relative density is higher as the particle size \n\nincreases. Indeed, this tendency can be in the other way around than one \n\nmight expect. As it was stated and demonstrated previously, smaller \n\nparticles have higher sintering activity to promote densification (see \nSection 5.2.1 about contact radius evolution). Then, larger particles \n\nshould decrease the densification rate.  \n\n \n\n\n\n102 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.19: Global relative density evolution of all bimodal samples over \n\ntime. The samples are referred to by the nickel-alumina particle size ratio. \n\n \n \n\nHowever, the behavior found in the densification results can be \n\nexplained by the microstructural nature of interpenetrating structures \n\nand by the large difference between the kinetic parameters of metals and \n\nceramics. This is discussed in detail in the next section. \n\n \n\n5.2.5 Discussion of Bimodal Packings  \n \n\nThe investigation of bimodal packing of composites has led to \n\ntwo different conclusions, which are not theoretically expected.  \n\nThe first discussion regards the microanalysis of the samples \n\nwith average contact radius and coordination number results. It has been \n\nfound that larger particles have taken longer to attain the final ACR \n\n(65% of the particle radius), as observed in Figure 5.10. This is in \n\nagreement with the sintering theory, in which larger particles have lower \n\nsurface energy and, thereby, less sintering activity. Therefore, the \n\nsimulations of larger particles have demonstrated that sintering of pair of \n\ncontacts is following the expected behavior. \n\nOn the other hand, the global densification results (Figure 5.19) \n\ndo not show the same tendency described before. The samples with \n\nlarger particles have reached higher relative density at the final of \n\nsimulation. To explain such behavior, it is needed to recall two \n\nimportant facts. Firstly, the nickel volume fraction chosen to simulate to \n\nbimodal packings is 60% and, thereby, they are interpenetrating \n\nstructures. Still, it is pointed out that for the monosized sample with 60 \n\nvol.% the metal and ceramic phase sintered independently from each \n\n\n\n103 \n\n \n\n \n\nother and, as a consequence, it has shown the slowest densification \n\namong the samples (see section 5.1.3, 5.1.4 and 5.1.5). Many defects \n\nhave been developed through the sample because the metal phase \n\nsintered too fast compared to the ceramic phase and they formed clusters \n\nof nickel particles. In other words, the monosized packing with 60% \n\nvolume of nickel barely densified globally due to the great difference \n\nbetween the sintering kinetics of the materials. \n\nIn parallel, the simulations with bimodal have not shown \n\ndevelopment of such defects (cracks). As explained in Section 5.3.1, the \n\nsintering force attracting larger nickel particles is weaker and it is not \n\nenough to cluster them, as observed in the monosized sample. Moreover, \n\nthe viscous forces (see Section 2.5), which act always against the \n\nmovement, have an absolute value more significant for these lower \n\nsintering forces. Therefore, the alumina particles in the bimodal packing \n\ncan keep attached to nickel ones and nickel particles are able to drive the \n\ndensification of the whole sample.  \n\nThus, composite materials characterized as interpenetrating \n\nstructures and composed by two phases (metal and ceramic) with large \n\ndifferences in sintering potential, larger metal particles can drive more \n\nhomogenous densification and fewer defects can be developed through \n\nthe samples. Consequently, higher relative densities can be reached if \n\ncompared to smaller metal particles due to the difference in the forces \n\ndistribution. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n105 \n\n \n\n \n\n6 CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK \n \n\nThe software MUSEN has been used to simulate the sintering \n\nprocess after implementing a suitable contact model. It is possible to \n\nhave access to the particles position, velocity, force, coordination \n\nnumber, as well as to see the shrinkage of the sample on the software 3D \n\ninterface. Using the position over simulation time, it was possible to \n\ncalculate the evolution of average contact radius between particles. \n\nAdditionally one can observe particle rearrangement, crack development \n\nand calculate the relative density inside a specified volume of the \n\nsample. From the relative density calculation, it is possible to plot the \n\ndensification curve of the process. \n\nThe special modeling approach proposed in this work has \n\nshown to be capable to simulate sintering of composites even in case of \n\ninterpenetrating structures. The simulation results of the monosized \n\npacking can be divided in three different sintering behaviors: metal-\n\ncontrolled, ceramic-controlled and contact retarded sintering.  \n\nThe metal-controlled samples have shown the highest \n\ndensification rates and relative density evolution, as one might expect. \n\nThe nickel particles have higher potential to sinter faster than alumina \n\ndue to their kinetic parameters and surface energy. Hence, metal \n\nparticles induce high forces to shrink the system and indirectly transfer \n\nforces to the sintering of ceramic phase. Therefore, the sintering of \n\nceramic particles is supported by the metal phase. These interactions \n\nbetween metal and ceramic phase are important in densification of \n\ncomposites when materials with large differences of sintering kinetic are \n\nused.  \n\nMoreover, the addition of a second phase with low sintering \n\nactivity (in this case alumina) reduces the overall densification in \n\ncomparison to the pure metal and it takes longer to reach the same \n\nrelative density. This result is in line with those found in the literature \n\nand confirms the correctness of the proposed approach.  \n\nThe contact retarded sintering has been found for the samples \n\ncharacterized as interpenetrating structures. They have shown the lowest \n\noverall densification due to independent densification of metal and \n\nceramic phase. It has led to large cracks through the samples and the \ninitial structure has been lost. For this reason, it is recommended to use \n\nmaterials with similar diffusion parameters to achieve homogenous \n\ndensification of an interpenetrating metal-ceramic composite. This \n\ninvestigation might be a topic for further works. \n\n\n\n106 \n\n \n\nThe simulation of bimodal packing with larger nickel particles \n\nand metal volume fraction of 60% has shown results that are more \n\ndebatable. Individual analysis of particles, through the contact radius \n\nevolution, has shown slower growing for larger nickel particles, as \n\nexpected. However, the global densification is higher for larger \n\nparticles. This might be explained by the particle configuration in \n\ninterpenetrating structures, in which metal and alumina form continuous \n\nnetwork of particle and the distribution of forces throughout the system. \n\nSince smaller particles have higher forces attracting each other, the \n\nmetal phase sinters quickly and forms long agglomerates of particles and \n\nthe global densification barely take place. When larger nickel particles \n\nare present, the forces promoted by them are weaker. Thereby, the \n\nviscous force between nickel-alumina contacts is enough to keep these \n\ncontacts attached and, finally, a global densification is observed.  \n\nTherefore, composite materials characterized as interpenetrating \n\nstructures and composed by two phases (metal and ceramic) with large \n\ndifferences in sintering potential, larger metal particles can drive more \n\nhomogenous densification and fewer defects can be developed through \n\nthe samples. Consequently, higher relative densities can be reached if \n\ncompared to smaller metal particles due to the difference in the forces \n\ndistribution.  \n\nTo confirm the correctness of the present modeling approach \n\nfor bimodal packing, it is suggested for further works to carry out \n\nsimulation of metal-matrix composites, instead of interpenetrating \n\nstructures, with varying of the size of metal particles. Other suggestion \n\nfor future work is to use samples with a distribution of particle size, \n\nwhich would make the simulation closer to reality. Still, it would be \n\ninteresting to use nickel and zirconia as materials of the composite for \n\nfurther works. These materials have more similar sintering parameters \n\nand it would lead to more homogenous densification.  \n\n \n\n\n\n107 \n\n \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n  \n\n[1] Chawla, K. K.
