para expans\u00e3o da \n\ncana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar no Brasil \n\n \n\nGlobalmente, o aumento da demanda de biocombust\u00edveis t\u00eam intensificado a taxa de \n\nmudan\u00e7a de uso da terra (MUT) para expans\u00e3o da produ\u00e7\u00e3o de culturas para fins energ\u00e9ticos. \n\nNo Brasil, a \u00e1rea de cana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar aumentou 35% (3,2 Mha) na \u00faltima d\u00e9cada. A expans\u00e3o \n\ndo cultivo de cana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar tem resultado em pastagens extensivas sendo submetidas a \n\nintensiva mecaniza\u00e7\u00e3o e ao uso de agroqu\u00edmicos, implicando diretamente na qualidade do \n\nsolo (QS). A hip\u00f3tese testada nesse estudo foi que a MUT resulta na degrada\u00e7\u00e3o da QS. Para \n\ntanto foi conduzido um estudo em tr\u00eas locais na regi\u00e3o centro-sul, com objetivo de avaliar as \n\nmodifica\u00e7\u00f5es na QS devido a principal sequ\u00eancia de MUT (vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o nativa - pastagem - \n\ncana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar) associada a expans\u00e3o do cultivo de cana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar no Brasil. Em cada uso da \n\nterra, amostras indeformadas e deformadas de solo foram coletadas nas profundidades de 0-\n\n10, 10-20 e 20-30 cm. Os atributos qu\u00edmicos e f\u00edsicos do solo foram mensurados atrav\u00e9s de \n\nan\u00e1lises laboratoriais e \u00e0 campo. Dados de atributos biol\u00f3gicos tamb\u00e9m foram inclu\u00eddos no \n\nestudo. Inicialmente, os efeitos da MUT foram quantificados individualmente para cada um \n\ndos atributos do solo, e em seguida as altera\u00e7\u00f5es na QS global foram avaliadas atrav\u00e9s da Soil \n\nManagement Assessment Framework (SMAF) e de seis \u00edndices de QS (IQS), desenvolvidos \n\nusando m\u00e9todos com complexidade crescente. Os resultados demonstraram que a convers\u00e3o \n\nda vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o nativa em pastagem extensiva resultou na acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o do solo, redu\u00e7\u00e3o dos \n\nteores de carbono org\u00e2nico (COS) e macronutrientes (especialmente P), e severa compacta\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndo solo, desequilibrando a rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre ar e \u00e1gua e aumentando a resist\u00eancia mec\u00e2nica do \n\nsolo ao crescimento radicular. Convers\u00e3o da pastagem em cana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar melhorou a \n\nqualidade qu\u00edmica do solo atrav\u00e9s da corre\u00e7\u00e3o da acidez e aumento dos macronutrientes. \n\nApesar dessas melhorias, prolongado per\u00edodo de cultivo de cana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar reduziu os teores \n\nde COS; e a maioria do P adicionado via fertilizantes acumulou em formas menos l\u00e1beis, \n\nconfirmando o importante papel do P org\u00e2nico no fornecimento de P dispon\u00edvel \u00e0s plantas em \n\nsolos brasileiros. O cultivo de cana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar teve impactos negativos nos atributos f\u00edsicos do \n\nsolo menos intensos do que aqueles gerados pelo uso com pastagem. Embora o preparo do \n\nsolo para plantio e reforma da cana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar reduziu a compacta\u00e7\u00e3o do solo, os dados \n\nsugeriram que estes efeitos s\u00e3o de curta dura\u00e7\u00e3o, ocorrendo a reconsolida\u00e7\u00e3o do solo e o \n\naumento dos riscos de eros\u00e3o ao longo do tempo. As altera\u00e7\u00f5es f\u00edsicas do solo induzidas pela \n\nMUT foram detectadas tanto por meio de atributos quantitativos quanto por meio de avalia\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nvisual da estrutura do solo (VESS), um m\u00e9todo simples e diretamente aplicado no campo. A \n\nSMAF detectou eficientemente as altera\u00e7\u00f5es na QS devido a MUT. Al\u00e9m disso, todos os IQS \n\ndesenvolvidos permitiram ranquear corretamente a QS entre os usos da terra. Assim, \n\nrecomendamos que IQS mais simples e com melhor rela\u00e7\u00e3o custo-benef\u00edcio usando poucos \n\nindicadores chaves, tais como: pH, P, K, VESS e COS com pondera\u00e7\u00e3o proporcional entre os \n\nsetores do solo (qu\u00edmico, f\u00edsico e biol\u00f3gico) sejam usados como protocolo para avaliar a QS \n\nnas \u00e1reas de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de cana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar. Os resultados obtidos usando a SMAF e os IQS \n\nsugeriram que a convers\u00e3o da vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o nativa em pastagem extensiva reduziu a QS, \n\ndegradando indicadores qu\u00edmicos, f\u00edsicos e biol\u00f3gicos. Por outro lado, a convers\u00e3o de \n\npastagem em cana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar n\u00e3o teve impactos na QS global, uma vez que a melhoria dos \n\natributos qu\u00edmicos compensou os impactos negativos nos indicatores f\u00edsicos e biol\u00f3gicos. \n\nDesta forma, esses resultados poder\u00e3o ser utilizados como base cient\u00edfica pelos produtores, \n\nextencionistas e pol\u00edticos para orientar estrat\u00e9gias de manejo que mantenham e/ou melhorem \n\na QS e consequentemente a sustentabilidade da produ\u00e7\u00e3o de cana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar no Brasil.  \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Produ\u00e7\u00e3o de etanol; Indicadores do solo; \u00cdndice de qualidade do solo; SMAF \n\n\n\n 12 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n 13 \n\nABSTRACT \n\nSoil quality responses to land-use change for sugarcane expansion in Brazil \n\n \n\nGlobally, increasing demands for biofuels have intensified the rate of land-use change \n\n(LUC) for expansion of bioenergy crops. In Brazil, the world\u2019s largest sugarcane-ethanol \n\nproducer, sugarcane area has expanded by 35% (3.2 Mha) in the last decade. Sugarcane \n\nexpansion has resulted in extensive pastures being subjected to intensive mechanization and \n\nlarge inputs of agrochemicals, which have direct implications on soil quality (SQ). We \n\nhypothesized that LUC to support sugarcane expansion leads to overall SQ degradation. To \n\ntest this hypothesis we conducted a field-study at three sites in the central-southern region, to \n\nassess the SQ response to the primary LUC sequence (i.e., native vegetation to pasture to \n\nsugarcane) associated to sugarcane expansion in Brazil. At each land use site undisturbed and \n\ndisturbed soil samples were collected from the 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm depths. Soil \n\nchemical and physical attributes were measured through on-farm and laboratory analyses. A \n\ndataset of soil biological attributes was also included in this study. Initially, the LUC effects \n\non each individual soil indicator were quantified. Afterward, the LUC effects on overall SQ \n\nwere assessed using the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF). Furthermore, six \n\nSQ indexes (SQI) were developed using approaches with increasing complexity. Our results \n\nshowed that long-term conversion from native vegetation to extensive pasture led to soil \n\nacidification, significant depletion of soil organic carbon (SOC) and macronutrients \n\n[especially phosphorus (P)] and severe soil compaction, which creates an unbalanced ratio \n\nbetween water- and air-filled pore space within the soil and increases mechanical resistance to \n\nroot growth. Conversion from pasture to sugarcane improved soil chemical quality by \n\ncorrecting for acidity and increasing macronutrient levels. Despite those improvements, most \n\nof the P added by fertilizer accumulated in less plant-available P forms, confirming the key \n\nrole of organic P has in providing available P to plants in Brazilian soils. Long-term \n\nsugarcane production subsequently led to further SOC depletions. Sugarcane production had \n\nslight negative impacts on soil physical attributes compared to pasture land. Although tillage \n\nperformed for sugarcane planting and replanting alleviates soil compaction, our data \n\nsuggested that the effects are short-term with persistent, reoccurring soil consolidation that \n\nincreases erosion risk over time. These soil physical changes, induced by LUC, were detected \n\nby quantitative soil physical properties as well as by visual evaluation of soil structure \n\n(VESS), an on-farm and user-friendly method for evaluating SQ. The SMAF efficiently \n\ndetected overall SQ response to LUC and it could be reliably used under Brazilian soil \n\nconditions. Furthermore, since all of the SQI values developed in this study were able to rank \n\nSQ among land uses. We recommend that simpler and more cost-effective SQI strategies \n\nusing a small number of carefully chosen soil indicators, such as: pH, P, K, VESS and SOC, \n\nand proportional weighting within of each soil sectors (chemical, physical and biological) be \n\nused as a protocol for SQ assessments in Brazilian sugarcane areas. The SMAF and SQI \n\nscores suggested that long-term conversion from native vegetation to extensive pasture \n\ndepleted overall SQ, driven by decreases in chemical, physical and biological indicators. In \n\ncontrast, conversion from pasture to sugarcane had no negative impacts on overall SQ, mainly \n\nbecause chemical improvements offset negative impacts on biological and physical indicators. \n\nTherefore, our findings can be used as scientific base by farmers, extension agents and public \n\npolicy makers to adopt and develop management strategies that sustain and/or improving SQ \n\nand the sustainability of sugarcane production in Brazil. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Ethanol production; Soil indicators; Soil quality index; SMAF     \n\n \n\n\n\n 14 \n\n  \n\n\n\n 15 \n\n1 INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\n \n\nLand-use change (LUC) processes have transformed a large portion of the planet\u2019s \n\nland surface, affecting directly the land capacity for provisioning ecosystem services (FOLEY \n\net al., 2005). Increasing global demand to support bioenergy feedstock production has \n\nintensified LUC worldwide [(e.g., South America (LAPOLA et al., 2010; GODEMBERG et \n\nal., 2014), North America (WRIGHT; WIMBERLY, 2013), Europe (FISCHER et al., 2010), \n\nAsia (MUKHERJEE; SOVACOOL, 2014), Africa (GASPARATOS et al., 2015), Australia \n\n(GRUNDY et al., 2016)]. Globally, a gross land demand for bioenergy ranging from 50 to \n\n200 Mha by 2050 was projected by Woods et al. (2015). Direct LUC refers to changes in land \n\nuse that occur where bioenergy feedstock production becomes established, and generally \n\nincludes both conversion from food or fiber production (including crop rotation patterns, \n\nconversion of pasture land, and changes in forest management) and conversion of natural \n\necosystems (KARP et al., 2015). Current LUC, especially forest conversion to agricultural \n\nland, has been and still is the primary driver of global deforestation and forest degradation in \n\nmany countries, especially in the tropics (KARP et al., 2015). Therefore, to minimize \n\nenvironmental impact, expansion of biofuel crop production on non-cultivated land or \n\nmarginal/degraded lands, such as extensive pasturelands, is currently being promoted.  \n\nBrazil is the world\u2019s largest sugarcane producer, and currently accounting for with \n\nabout 40% of the global harvest, of which approximately a half is used to produce ethanol \n\n(COMPANHIA NACIONAL DE ABASTECIMENTO, 2016). Roughly one-third of the total \n\nglobal ethanol fuel production is provided for through Brazilian sugarcane, with small \n\ncontributions from other Latin America countries (GOLDEMBERG et al., 2014). The \n\nevolution of sugarcane, sugar and ethanol production in Brazil is shown in Figure 1A. \n\nHistorically sugarcane expansion has been concentrated in the central-southern region (Figure \n\n1B), with 70% of this expansion occurring in extensive pasturelands (ADAMI et al., 2012). \n\nThe vast area of degraded pasture in Brazil, coupled with opportunities for improvements in \n\ncurrent ranching practices, could provide enough land for sugarcane production to meet the \n\nprojected domestic demand for ethanol whilst meeting the demand for other ecosystem \n\nservices (HORTA NOGUEIRA; CAPAZ, 2013; GOLDEMBERG et al., 2014; \n\nSTRASSBURG et al., 2014). \n\n\n\n 16 \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - Evolution of sugarcane, sugar and ethanol production (A) and sugarcane cropped \n\narea (B) in Brazil (UNI\u00c3O DA IND\u00daSTRIA DE CANA-DE-A\u00c7\u00daCAR, 2016) \n\n \n\nCurrent preditions indicate that an additional of 6.4 Mha of sugarcane land will be \n\nrequired to meet the Brazilian demand for ethanol by 2021 (GOLDEMBERG et al., 2014). \n\nThe accelerated pace of recent and projected sugarcane expansion, through which extensive \n\npasture land has been subjected to intensive mechanization and agrochemical inputs has \n\nraised concerns regarding potential ecosystem impacts of LUC in Brazil. It is expected that \n\nmaximizing the use of one ecosystem service (e.g., provision of biofuel and air quality) often \n\nleads to a sharp decline of other ecosystem services, particularly regulating services (e.g., C \n\nsequestration, soil retention, and water resource conservation) (FU et al., 2015).

Karlen et al. (1997) conceptualized \n\nSQ as the capacity of a specific kind of soil to function, within natural or managed ecosystem \n\nboundaries, to sustain plant and animal productivity, maintain or enhance water and air \n\nquality, and support human health and habitation. It is a complex functional concept and \n\ncannot be measured directly in the field or laboratory; but can be indirectly inferred by soil \n\nindicators. Indicators of SQ are those measurable soil properties and processes that have \n\ngreatest sensitivity to changes in soil function and its ecosystem services (ANDREWS; \n\nKARLEN; CAMBARDELLA, 2004; ZORNOZA et al., 2015). \n\nAssessment of SQ involves a three-step conceptual framework (Figure 2), including (i) \n\nindicator selection (chemical, physical and biological); (ii) indicator interpretation (linear or \n\nnon-linear scoring curves); and (iii) integration into an overall SQ index (SQI) (KARLEN; \n\nDITZLER; ANDREWS, 2003). Assessment values are generally expressed as a fraction or \n\npercentage of full performance for soil functions such as crop productivity, nutrient cycling, \n\nor environmental protection (ANDREWS; KARLEN; CAMBARDELLA, 2004). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 - Conceptual framework for the soil quality assessment (Adapted from Karlen, \n\nDitzler and Andrews 2003) \n\nMinimum Dataset \n\nChemical \n\nIndicators \n\nPhysical \n\nIndicators \n\nBiological \n\nIndicators \n\nStep I - \n\nIndicator \n\nselection \n\nStep II - \n\nIndicator \n\ninterpretation \n\nStep III- \n\nIndicator \n\nintegration \n\nSOIL QUALITY INDEX \n\n \n\n = f (scored MDS indicators) \n\n\n\n 18 \n\nAlthough this conceptual framework is broadly used for SQ assessments worldwide, \n\ndifferent approaches have been tested to perform each one of the three steps (e.g., \n\nANDREWS; KARLEN; MITCHELL, 2002; ANDREWS; KARLEN; CAMBARDELLA, \n\n2004; MUKHERJEE; LAL, 2014). Soil quality indicators can be selected based on expert \n\nopinion, statistical procedures, decision rules, etc. Linear and non-linear curves can be used \n\nfor scoring measured indicator values. Finally, scored values can be integrated into an overall \n\nindex using simple additives or weighted additive methodologies. Each approach has \n\nadvantages and disadvantages, and its performance dependent of the assessment\u2019s goals. \n\nTherefore, since there is no a universal method that can be used across multiple natural and \n\nanthropogenic ecosystems, many SQ assessment strategies have been developed and tested \n\nfor specific purposes under particular environmental conditions worldwide. A distinguished \n\nexample of the existing approaches is the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF), \n\nwhich was initially developed and used by researchers in the USA on North American soils \n\n(ANDREWS; KARLEN; CAMBARDELLA, 2004); but it has been constantly enhanced by \n\ninternational collaborations, enabling to extend its use to other countries around world. \n\nHowever, to our knowledge there is no any protocol or published studies evaluating \n\nSQ changes induced by the LUC for sugarcane expansion in Brazil. Therefore, we conducted \n\na field study in central-southern Brazil, the largest sugarcane-producing regions of the world, \n\nfor assessing SQ responses to the primary LUC sequence (i.e., native vegetation to pasture to \n\nsugarcane) associated with sugarcane expansion. For that, the specific objectives were to: i) \n\nevaluate the LUC impacts on soil chemical attributes; ii) investigate soil physical and \n\nstructural changes induced by the LUC impacts; iii) integrate soil chemical, physical and \n\nbiological responses to LUC into an overall SQ assessment using different approaches and \n\nframeworks; iv) establish a protocol for assessing SQ changes in Brazilian sugarcane areas. \n\nWe tested the main hypothesis that the LUC sequence induces alteration on dynamic of soil \n\nchemical, physical and biological indicators, leading to overall SQ degradation and its \n\nimpacts can detected by SQ indexing strategies.   \n\nTo meet our objectives, this thesis is organized into eight chapters. Briefly, the first \n\none presents a short introduction about the research topic studied. The second one addresses \n\nthe LUC impacts associated to sugarcane expansion on soil chemical attributes and overall \n\nsoil chemical quality. The third one evaluates soil phosphorus pool (labile, moderately labile \n\nand non-labile pools, as well as biological and geochemical pools) changes induced by the \n\nLUC for sugarcane expansion. The fourth one addresses the LUC impacts on soil physical \n\nproperties and overall soil physical quality. The fifth one evaluates the sensitivity of the \n\n\n\n 19 \n\nVisual Evaluation of Soil Structure (VESS) method for detecting soil structure quality \n\nchanges due to sugarcane expansion. The sixth provides the results of the first application of \n\nSoil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) for evaluating overall SQ changes in \n\nBrazil. The seventh one investigates SQ changes induced by sugarcane expansion through six \n\nindexing strategies and provides a protocol for SQ assessment in Brazilian sugarcane areas. \n\nFinally, the eigth one provides the final considerations of this study. \n\n \n\nThe principal findings obtained in this thesis have resulted in the following scientific \n\nmanuscripts:  \n\n \n\nCHERUBIN, M.R.; FRANCO, A.L.C.; CERRI, C.E.P.; OLIVEIRA, D.M.S.; DAVIES, C.A.; \n\nCERRI, C.C.

Soil quality is a key indicator to infer about the \n\nenvironmental sustainability of Brazilian ethanol production. Our objective was to quantify \n\nthe effects of the most common LUC sequence associated with sugarcane expansion (i.e., \n\nnative vegetation to pasture to sugarcane) on chemical attributes in tropical soils. Soil \n\nsampling was carried out in three study sites located in central-southern Brazil, primary \n\nsugarcane region of production and expansion of the world. Overall, long-term conversion \n\nfrom native vegetation to extensive pasture decreased soil organic carbon (SOC), total \n\nnitrogen (TN), available phosphorus, sulfur, calcium, magnesium and boron contents. In \n\naddition, the LUC led to soil acidification and decreased CECpH7, indicating that pasturelands \n\nhad poor soil chemical quality. The LUC from pasture to sugarcane increased soil nutrient \n\nlevels and reduced the soil acidity due to inputs of lime and fertilizers. Despite that, \n\nincrements of available P and base saturation are necessary to achieve ideal soil chemical \n\nconditions to sugarcane growth. Short-time (<5 years) conversion from pasture to sugarcane \n\nhad no significant impacts on SOC and NT contents; however, after 20 years of sugarcane \n\nproduction significant losses were quantified. Overall, our findings suggest that sugarcane \n\nexpansion in Brazil replacing pasturelands will promote improvements on soil chemical \n\nquality. Nevertheless, sugarcane expansion can be associated with management strategies to \n\nincrease soil organic matter and improve the soil fertility, reducing the environmental and \n\neconomic costs associated with ethanol production in Brazil. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Soil chemical quality; Biofuel crops; Ethanol production; Environmental impacts; \n\nSoil fertility \n\n \n\n2.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nLand use activities whether converting natural landscapes for human use or changing \n\nmanagement practices on human-dominated lands have transformed a large proportion of the \n\nplanet\u2019s land surface (FOLEY et al., 2005), with large short and long term environmental \n\nimplications (LAMBIN; MEYFROIDT, 2011; TILMAN et al., 2011). The environmental \n\nimpacts of agriculture include those caused by expansion (when croplands and pastures \n\nextend into new areas, replacing natural ecosystems) and those caused by intensification \n\n(when existing lands are managed to be more productive) (FOLEY et al., 2011). \n\nIn Brazil, the area currently cultivated with sugarcane is undergoing significant \n\nexpansion due to the growing demand for bioethanol, driven by environmental, geopolitical \n\nand economic issues (LAPOLA et al., 2010; 2014; GOLDEMBERG et al., 2014; \n\nHERNANDES; BUFON; SEABRA, 2014). This is considered one of the main causes of LUC \n\n\n\n 24 \n\nin the central-southern region (LAPOLA et al., 2010; 2014; GOLDEMBERG et al., 2014; \n\nWALTER et al., 2014).  \n\nBrazil is currently the world\u2019s largest sugarcane producer, accounting for one-third of \n\nglobal harvest. An area of 9.0 Mha was cultivated during the 2015/2016 season \n\n(COMPANHIA NACIONAL DE ABASTECIMENTO, 2015), with 90% of the sugarcane \n\ncultivated in Brazil concentrated within the central-southern region under tropical soils, \n\nespecially Oxisols and Ultisols. Although Brazilian sugarcane production is significant, an \n\nadditional 6.4 Mha of sugarcane area would be required to meet the projected internal demand \n\nof ethanol by 2021 (61.6 billion L) (GOLDEMBERG et al., 2014). In central-southern Brazil, \n\nsugarcane expanded primarily onto pasturelands and annual croplands, with limited expansion \n\ninto areas of native vegetation (ADAMI et al., 2012; EGESKOG et al., 2014). In the near \n\nfuture, sugarcane expansion is most likely to occur in areas previously used as extensive \n\npasture (LAPOLA et al., 2010; ADAMI et al., 2012; EGESKOG et al., 2014; \n\nGOLDEMBERG et al., 2014). \n\nThis recent expansion in production to meet ethanol demand, in combination with the \n\nprojected future expansion, has raised concerns about the potential environmental impacts of \n\nLUC in Brazil (HERNANDES; BUFON; SEABRA, 2014). Therefore, it is necessary \n\ninvestigate the LUC effects to assess of sustainability of expanding ethanol production. The \n\ngreatest challenge is to define sensitive indicators that reflect local specificities of the \n\nenvironmental implications from LUC (GASPARATOS; STROMBERG; TAKEUCHI, 2011; \n\nEFROYMSON et al., 2013; FU et al., 2015).  \n\nThe soil quality is identified as key component to assess the environmental \n\nsustainability of natural and anthropogenic ecosystems (KARLEN et al., 1997) and it has been \n\nproposed into current protocols such as the one elaborate by Better Sugar Cane Initiative \n\n\u201cBonsucro\n\u00ae\n\n\u201d\n \ncertification (BETTER SUGAR CANE INITIATIVE, 2011) and the \u201cGlobal \n\nBioenergy Partnership\u201d by FAO (GLOBAL BIOENERGY PARTNERSHIP, 2011). To \n\nevaluate the effects of land use and soil managements on soil quality, soil chemical attributes \n\ncan be used as potential indicators, such as: available macro- and micronutrients, acidity \n\nattributes, cation exchange capacity and soil organic carbon (SOC) (DORAN; PARKIN, \n\n1994; VEZZANI; MIELNICZUK, 2011; CARDOSO et al., 2013; ZORNOZA et al., 2015) \n\nPrevious studies indicated that LUC affects soil chemical attributes in different ways. \n\nIn a global meta-analysis Don, Schumacher and Freibauer (2011) showed that conversions \n\nfrom forest to pasture and/or cropland promoted SOC losses. Recently, a large study under \n\ntropical soils in central-southern Brazil showed that soil C stocks decreased following LUC \n\n\n\n 25 \n\nfrom native vegetation to pastures and then from pasture to sugarcane (MELLO et al., 2014). \n\nHowever, C stocks increases were found where cropland was converted to sugarcane \n\n(MELLO et al., 2014). On the other hand, Carvalho et al. (2009) showed the conversion from \n\nBrazilian\u2019s Cerrado into cropland under conservative management in an Oxisol increased \n\nSOC and nutrients (P, K, Ca, Mg) and reduced soil acidity. In this case, it was driven mainly \n\nby fertilizer application and liming to reduce soil acidity. Geissen et al. (2009) under Peruvian \n\nhighland jungle (Amazon forest) region and Lindel, \u00c5str\u00f6m and \u00d6berg (2010) under different \n\nsoils in tropical Southeast Mexico, concluded that the LUC did not lead to significant changes \n\nin soil chemical attributes, although, Geissen et al. (2009) observed that soils used as \n\npastureland became acidified. \n\nTherefore, our objective was to quantify effects of the most common LUC sequence \n\nassociated with sugarcane expansion (i.e., native vegetation to pasture to sugarcane) on \n\nchemical attributes in tropical soils of central-southern Brazil. We hypothesized that i) LUC \n\nfrom native vegetation to extensive pasture leads to significant depletions of SOC and \n\nmacronutrients and increase soil acidification; ii) sugarcane cultivation replacing extensive \n\npasturelands can recover soil fertility; iii) pasturelands have lower soil chemical quality than \n\nsugarcane fields, constituting hotspots for sugarcane expansion in Brazil. \n\n \n\n2.2 Material and Methods \n\n \n\n2.2.1 Study sites \n\n \n\nThe study was carried out in central-southern Brazil, the largest sugarcane-producing \n\nregion of the world (Figure 1).

Despite that concern, a \n\ntextural difference between the soil under pasture (lower clay content) and the other land uses \n\nof the same chronosequence was observed at Lat_17S (Table 1). Thus, we highlighted that all \n\nstatements about LUC effects on P pools for this site must be interpreted carefully. When \n\nadopting a chronosequence approach the variability in soils within the chronosequence is not \n\nalways possible to be controlled, but, the global lack of long-term studies evaluating the \n\neffects of LUC, and especially in Brazil, justifies to keep this synchronic approach in our \n\nstudy (SIQUEIRA NETO et al., 2010; COSTA JUNIOR et al., 2013).  \n\nLand use historical information and brief description of management operations \n\nconducted at the studied sites are shown in Figure 4 and Table 2. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 4 - Schematization of the land use history in the studied chronosequences\n\n\n\n 31 \n\nTable 2 - Land use historical information and brief description of management operations conducted at the studied sites \n\nSite Land use Description \n\nLat_17S \n\n \n\nNative  \n\nvegetation \n\nCerradao forest formation, Cerrado biome, characterized by sclerophyllous and xeromorphic species. The vegetation is dense compared to the \n\nCerrado stricto sensu (savanna). \n\nPasture \n\nConversion from native vegetation to pasture occurred at 1980. Pasture is composed by tropical grasses of the genus Brachiaria, predominantly \n\nB. decumbens, B. brizantha and B. ruziziensis, and supports 1.5 AU ha\n-1\n\n full year. The conversion of native vegetation to pasture occurred of the \n\nbeginning of the 1980s. The predominant species are of the Brachiaria genus, especially B. decumbens, B. brizantha e B. ruziziensis. The \n\nstocking rate is 1.5 UA ha\n-1\n\n along the all year.  \n\nSugarcane \n\nSugarcane cultivar RB855453 was cultivated over part of the pasture at 2009. At that time soil was prepared by plowing and di sking. The \n\nsugarcane mean yield since the implantation is 81.5 ton ha\n-1\n\n. At the sampling time for chemical and biological analyses the sugarcane was in the \n\nthird ratoon cropping of its cycle; while at soil sampling time for physical analyses the soil had been newly tilled for sugarcane replanting \n\n(chiseling and disking). Soil acidity was corrected with the application of 1.6 ton ha\n-1\n\n of dolomitic lime. Also was applied 1 ton ha\n-1\n\n of gypsum \n\nbefore cropping to supply S and Ca and 150 kg ha\n-1\n\n of P2O5. Annually the crop fertilization is carried out by the application of 110 kg ha\n-1\n\n N and \n\n75 kg ha\n-1\n\n K2O. Sugarcane has been mechanically harvested using a harvester (?20 Mg) and transported by a tractor + trailer (?10 + 20 Mg). \n\nSugarcane production has not used controlled traffic system. \n\nLat_21S \n\n \n\nNative  \n\nvegetation \n\nThe local vegetation is seasonal semideciduous forest, Atlantic forest biome, in which a portion of the trees defoliates during the dry season. It \n\nis a transitional region, where the forest has more xeromorphic species than the wetter areas of the Atlantic forest, on the other hand presents \n\nless xeromorphic species than the Cerrado vegetation. \n\nPasture \nConversion from native vegetation to pasture occurred at 1980. Pasture is composed by tropical grasses of the Brachiaria genus and supports 2 \n\nAU ha\n-1\n\n full year. Annually, the pasture receives 25 kg ha\n-1 \n\nN, 6 kg ha\n-1 \n\nP2O5, 23 kg ha\n-1 \n\nK2O (mineral fertilizer). \n\nSugarcane \n\nSugarcane cultivar SP791011 was cultivated over part of the pasture at 2010. At that time soil was prepared by plowing and di sking. The \n\nsugarcane mean yield since the implantation is 80 ton ha\n-1\n\n. At the sampling time sugarcane was in the fourth ratoon cropping of its cycle. Soil \n\nacidity was corrected by liming. The sugarcane was annually fertilized with 11 kg ha\n-1 \n\nN, 55 kg ha\n-1 \n\nP2O5 and 55 kg ha\n-1 \n\nK2O (mineral fertilizer). \n\nVinasse was applied to sugarcane in 2012 at an amount of 150 m\n3\n ha\n\n-1\n (corresponding to approximately 35 kg ha\n\n-1 \nN, 30 kg ha\n\n-1 \nP2O5 and 300 kg \n\nha\n-1\n\n K2O). Sugarcane has been mechanically harvested without controlled traffic system using machines similar to those described for Lat_17S. \n\nLat_23S \n\nNative  \n\nvegetation \nThe local vegetation is similar that described for Lat_21S site. \n\nPasture \nConversion from native vegetation to pasture occurred at 1979. Pasture is composed by tropical grasses of the Cynodon genus, and supports 1 \n\nAU ha\n-1\n\n full year. \n\nSugarcane \n\nSugarcane cultivar CTC6 was cultivated over part of the pasture at the beginning of the 1990s. At that time soil was prepared by plowing and \n\ndisking. The sugarcane mean yield since the implantation is 85 ton ha\n-1\n\n. At the sampling time sugarcane was in the fifth ratoon cropping of its \n\ncycle. Soil acidity was corrected by liming. Annually the crop fertilization is carried out by the application of 45 kg ha\n-1\n\n of N (urea) plus 200 m\n3\n \n\nha\n-1\n\n of vinasse (approximately 45 kg ha\n-1 \n\nN, 40 kg ha\n-1 \n\nP2O5 and 400 kg ha\n-1\n\n K2O) and 25 ton ha\n-1\n\n of filter cake and boiler ash (approximately 75 \n\nkg ha\n-1 \n\nN, 55 kg ha\n-1 \n\nP2O5 and 30 kg ha\n-1\n\n K2O). Sugarcane has been mechanically harvested since 2003 without controlled traffic system using \n\nmachines similar to those described for Lat_17S. From 2013 around 50% of the sugarcane straw has been removed from the soil for electric \n\nenergy production. \n\n\n\n 32 \n\n2.2.3 Sampling and soil chemical attributes \n\n \n\nSoil sampling was completed in January 2013 during the rainy season, when the \n\nsugarcane was in full growth close to harvest. Soil samples within each land use (i.e., native \n\nvegetation, pasture and sugarcane) were collected using a consistent grid pattern composed of \n\nnine points spaced 50 m apart, providing a total of 27 sampling points (3 land uses x 9 points) \n\nfor each site or 81 sampling points for the three studied sites. Around each sampling point, \n\ncomposite samples consisting of 12 subsamples were collected using a Dutch auger, at three \n\ndepths: 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm. This provided a total of 243 disturbed soil samples for \n\nchemical analyses.  \n\nThe soil chemical attributes studied were: soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen \n\n(TN) which were measured by dry combustion on a LECO\n\u00ae\n CN-2000 elemental analyzer \n\n(furnace at 1350 \u00baC in pure oxygen); available phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), \n\nmagnesium (Mg), sulfur (S-sulphate), boron (B), cooper (Cu), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), \n\nzinc (Zn), active acidity (pHCaCl2 0.01mol L\n-1\n\n), potential acidity (H+Al), base saturation (BS) \n\nand potential cation exchange capacity (CECpH7) which were measured by analytical methods \n\ndescribed in Raij et al. (2001).  \n\n \n\n2.2.4 Data analyses \n\n \n\nThe normality of data was confirmed by Shapiro-Wilk\u2019s test (p>0.05), using the \n\nStatistical Analysis System - SAS v.9.3 (SAS Inc, Cary, USA), therefore no transformation of \n\ndata was required. The data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) using PROC \n\nGLM procedure. If the ANOVA F statistic was significant at (p<0.05), the means were \n\ncompared using Tukey\u2019s test (p<0.05) by SAS v.9.3. To analyze the effects within each site, \n\nmeans were compared within each site, and to analyze the overall (regional scale) effects, \n\nmeans were compared considering each site as a block. The three soil depths were analyzed \n\nseparately. A Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis (p<0.01 and p<0.05) was performed using PROC \n\nCORR procedure among all soil chemical attributes. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 33 \n\n2.3 Results \n\n \n\n2.3.1 Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen \n\n \n\nThe LUC to support sugarcane expansion induced significant SOC losses in the three \n\nstudy sites (Figure 5). At Lat_17S and Lat_21S the conversion from native vegetation to \n\npasture resulted in SOC reductions in all soil layers, representing losses of approximately \n\n40% in the 0-30 cm layer. In contrast, short-term (<5 years) conversion from pasture to \n\nsugarcane did not induced significant SOC changes (Figure 5A,C,E). At Lat_23S, the SOC \n\ncontents in natural ecosystem is higher than others study sites, averaged 37, 33 and 30 g kg\n-1\n\n \n\nfor 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm layers. The soils at this site have much higher clay content \n\n(Table 1). Conversion from native vegetation to pasture promoted significant SOC changes \n\nonly in the subsurface layer (20-30 cm) (Figure 5C). After >20 years of conversion from \n\npasture to sugarcane were observed severe SOC losses, decreasing from 36.4 to 18.9 g kg\n-1\n\n \n\n(0-10 cm), from 27.6 to 18.4 g kg\n-1\n\n (10-20 cm) and from 20.6 to 17.3 g kg\n-1\n\n (20-30 cm).  \n\nThe TN response to LUC was similar to that quantified for SOC (Figure 5). At \n\nLat_17S and Lat_21S conversion from native vegetation to pasture led to NT losses of \n\napproximately 42% and 55%, respectively (0-30 cm layer) (Figure 5 B,D,F). In general, short-\n\nterm conversion from pasture to sugarcane had no negative impacts on TN, even some \n\nincreases were found for the subsurface soil layers (10-20 and 20-30 cm) at Lat_17S. Similar \n\nto verified for SOC, long-term conversion from native vegetation to pasture and then from \n\npasture to sugarcane induced significant soil TN losses at Lat_23S. \n\nIn the regional scale (three sites combined), the LUC induced significant SOC and TN \n\ndepletions (Figure 6). Conversion from native vegetation to pasture decreased 28 and 18% of \n\nthe SOC and NT contents, while conversion from pasture to sugarcane decreased 18 and 10%, \n\nrespectively.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 34 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5 - Soil organic carbon (A;C;E) and total nitrogen (B;D;F) in the 0-10, 10-20 and 20-\n\n30 cm layers, respectively, under native vegetation (NV), pasture (PA) and \n\nsugarcane (SC) at Lat_17S, Lat_21S and Lat_23S in central-southern Brazil. *Mean \nvalues within each site in same depth followed by the same letter do not differ among themselves \n\naccording to Tukey\u2019s test (p<0.05).

In general, conversion from native vegetation to pasture decreased pH and \n\nBS values. At Lat_21S, the soil had higher pH and BS, and lower H+Al compared to the other \n\nsites and land uses (Table 3), most likely due to recent historical forest understory burning, \n\nbecause remains of ash were found on the soil surface. Sugarcane cultivation replacing \n\npasture promoted significant decreases in both the active and potential acidity and \n\nconsequently, BS was increased. However, in the sugarcane soils still remain acidity problems \n\nfor crop, since the average pH (0-30 cm) was between 5.0 (Lat_17S; Lat_21S) and 5.5 \n\n(Lat_23S), BS values were 45% (Lat_17S), 60% (Lat_21S) and 65% (Lat_23S), and H+Al \n\ncontents approximately of 30 mmolc dm\n-3\n\n. At the regional scale, this same response was \n\nconfirmed, where sugarcane soils have lower acidity and higher BS, pasture soils have the \n\ngreatest active acidity, and native vegetation sites have the highest potential acidity (soil \n\nelectric charges are saturated with H\n+\n and Al\n\n3+\n). The LUC led to significant decrease of \n\nCECpH7 from native vegetation to pasture, but were not observed differences from pasture to \n\nsugarcane (Table 3) for all sites.  \n\n \n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nNative vegetation Pasture Sugarcane\n\nT\no\n\nta\nl n\n\nitro\ng\ne\nn\n (g\n\n k\ng\n\n-1) \nS\n\no\nil\n\n o\nrg\n\na\nn\nic\n\n c\na\nrb\n\no\nn\n (\n\ng\n k\n\ng\n-1\n\n) \n\nLand-use change \n\nSOC TN\n\na* \n\nb \n\nc \n\na \n\nb \nb \n\n\n\n 36 \n\n2.3.3 Soil macro- and micro-nutrients \n\n \n\nOverall, higher Ca and Mg contents were found under sugarcane  (Table 4) as function \n\nof lime application to neutralize soil acidity. Native vegetation at Lat_21S was an exception, \n\nbecause the effects of forest understory burning and ash (earlier commented) increased the Ca \n\nand Mg contents in the surface soil. There were significant improvements in K contents under \n\npasture soils at the Lat_21S and Lat_23S compared to native vegetation and sugarcane (Table \n\n4). Overall, K contents under pasture soils were 28 and 30% higher than native vegetation and \n\nsugarcane soils for the 0-30 cm layer. Native vegetation and sugarcane showed no significant \n\nK differences among themselves.  \n\nThe lowest available P contents were found at Lat_17S site (Table 4), where the soil is \n\nin more advanced weathering stage [i.e., lower Ki and Kr indexes (Table 1)]. Conversion \n\nfrom native vegetation to pasture significantly decreased available P by 40% at Lat_17S, 65% \n\nat Lat_21S and 27% at Lat_23S, with an average of 42% at the regional scale for the 0-30 cm \n\nlayer. Under sugarcane soils P contents were similar to those under pasture (Lat_23S and \n\nregional scale) or  under native vegetation (Lat_17S and Lat_21S). There were significant \n\nreductions of S-sulphate contents (Table 4) due to conversion from native vegetation to \n\npasture at Lat_23S and from pasture to sugarcane at the Lat_21S and Lat_23S. In contrast, \n\nthere was no S differences between native vegetation and pasture at Lat_17S; and sugarcane \n\nsoil had the highest S values due to gypsum application before sugarcane planting (Table 2).  \n\nThe soil B contents were negatively affected by the transition from native vegetation \n\nto pasture (Table 5). Part of those B losses was recovered by sugarcane cultivation under \n\npasture; however, in all three sites the average B contents were&lt;0.6 mg dm\n-3\n\n, level \n\nconsidered as adequate for Brazilian tropical soils (RAIJ et al., 1997). Other micronutrients, \n\nCu, Mn, Fe and Zn (metal ions), in general, showed similar responses relative to impacts \n\ncaused by LUC (Table 5). Thus, under pasture soils where the pH is lower, there were \n\nsignificant increases in Cu, Mn, Fe and Zn availability. Under sugarcane the concentration of \n\nCu, Mn and Fe decreased, although the contents contained in soil are still considered high, \n\nand meet the crop nutritional demand. The Zn contents were&lt;0.5 mg dm\n-3\n\n at Lat_17S site \n\n(Oxisol more weathered), below the recommended range (0.6 - 1.0 mg dm\n-3\n\n) by Raij et al. \n\n(1997), requiring application of this nutrient. \n\n\n\n 37 \n\nTable 3 - Soil acidity properties and CECpH7 from 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm soil layers under native vegetation (NV), pasture (PA) and \n\nsugarcane (SC) in central-southern

In addition, SOC and \n\nTN were correlated with exchangeable anions P and S-sulphate, exchangeable cations K, Mg \n\nand Ca, and micronutrients Mn, Zn and B. \n\nThere were significant correlations between soil chemical properties that influence soil \n\nacidity [pH vs BS (r = 0.95); pH vs H+Al (r = -0.64); BS vs H+Al (r = -0.63)] and with \n\nexchangeable cations, especially Ca and Mg [Ca vs pH (r = 0.91); Mg vs pH (r = 0.77)]. For \n\nthe micronutrients, Fe and Cu were negatively correlated with pH and exchangeable cations; \n\nContents of B, Zn and Mn were positively correlated with P and with the exchange cations K, \n\nCa and Mg (Table 6).  \n\n \n\n\n\n 41 \n\nTable 6 - Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients (r) and probability of error (p) between soil chemical properties in areas of the land-use change \n\n(native vegetation \u2013 pasture \u2013 sugarcane) in central-southern Brazil \n  TN P K Ca Mg S pH BS H+Al CECpH7 B Cu Fe Mn Zn \n\nSOC \n0.955\n\n* \n0.498\n\n*\n 0.432\n\n*\n 0.210\n\n*\n 0.416\n\n*\n 0.303\n\n*\n -0.033 0.034 0.596\n\n*\n 0.827\n\n*\n 0.564\n\n*\n 0.126 0.150 0.721\n\n*\n 0.714\n\n*\n \n\n<0.0001\n\u2020\n&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001 0.6112 0.6042&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001 0.1967 0.1261&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001 \n\nTN \n1.000 0.604\n\n*\n 0.437\n\n*\n 0.338\n\n*\n 0.437\n\n*\n 0.332\n\n*\n 0.077 0.132\n\n**\n 0.551\n\n*\n 0.873\n\n*\n 0.681\n\n*\n 0.041 0.111 0.676\n\n*\n 0.707\n\n*\n \n\n \n<0.0001&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001 0.2418 0.0445&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001 0.6784 0.2638&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001 \n\nP  \n1.000 0.470\n\n*\n 0.620\n\n*\n 0.643\n\n*\n 0.132\n\n**\n 0.496\n\n*\n 0.560\n\n*\n 0.043 0.578\n\n*\n 0.746\n\n*\n -0.097 -0.046 0.482\n\n*\n 0.631\n\n*\n \n\n  \n<0.0001&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001 0.0413&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001 0.5052&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001 0.3216 0.6420&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001 \n\nK   \n1.000 0.314\n\n*\n 0.500\n\n*\n 0.022 0.193\n\n*\n 0.365\n\n*\n -0.041 0.284\n\n*\n 0.455\n\n*\n -0.220\n\n**\n 0.331\n\n*\n 0.675\n\n*\n 0.648\n\n*\n \n\n   \n<0.0001&lt;0.0001 0.7306 0.0027&lt;0.0001 0.5230&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001 0.0234 0.0005&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001 \n\nCa    \n1.000 0.783\n\n*\n -0.008 0.907\n\n*\n 0.874\n\n*\n -0.430\n\n*\n 0.365\n\n*\n 0.564\n\n*\n -0.302\n\n*\n -0.434\n\n*\n 0.257\n\n*\n 0.358\n\n*\n \n\n    \n<0.0001 0.9034&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001 0.0016&lt;0.0001 0.0079 0.0002 \n\nMg     \n1.000 0.041 0.766\n\n*\n 0.844\n\n*\n -0.326\n\n*\n 0.371\n\n*\n 0.489\n\n*\n -0.163 -0.305\n\n*\n 0.465\n\n*\n 0.503\n\n*\n \n\n     \n0.5258&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001 0.0940 0.0015&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001 \n\nS      \n1.000 -0.010 0.019 0.280\n\n*\n 0.287\n\n*\n 0.161 0.286\n\n*\n 0.030 0.222\n\n**\n 0.234\n\n**\n \n\n      \n0.8793 0.7720&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001 0.1017 0.0030 0.7571 0.0223 0.0157 \n\npH       \n1.000 0.954\n\n*\n -0.638\n\n*\n 0.085 0.314\n\n*\n -0.187 -0.521\n\n*\n 0.075 0.195\n\n**\n \n\n       \n<0.0001&lt;0.0001 0.1883 0.0011 0.0545&lt;0.0001 0.4426 0.0455 \n\nBS        \n1.000 -0.631\n\n*\n 0.090 0.394\n\n*\n -0.238\n\n**\n -0.441\n\n*\n 0.204\n\n**\n 0.295\n\n*\n \n\n        \n<0.0001 0.1649&lt;0.0001 0.0142&lt;0.0001 0.0363 0.0021 \n\nH+Al         \n1.000 0.676\n\n*\n 0.295\n\n*\n 0.175 0.324\n\n*\n 0.208\n\n**\n 0.164 \n\n         \n<0.0001 0.0023 0.0729 0.0007 0.0327 0.0939 \n\nCECpH7          \n1.000 0.780\n\n*\n -0.051 0.012 0.484\n\n*\n 0.509\n\n*\n \n\n          \n<0.0001 0.6066 0.9019&lt;0.0001&lt;0.0001 \n\nB           \n1.000 -0.316\n\n*\n -0.173 0.362\n\n*\n 0.419\n\n*\n \n\n           \n0.0010 0.0770 0.0001&lt;0.0001 \n\nCu            \n1.000 -0.144 0.124 -0.013 \n\n            \n0.1422 0.2068 0.8982 \n\nFe             \n1.000 0.165 0.264\n\n*\n \n\n             \n0.0902 0.0063 \n\nMn              \n1.000 0.843\n\n*\n \n\n              \n<0.0001 \n\n \n\n*Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients significant (p<0.01) and ** (p<0.05).

The key factors of these SOC and TN losses are the following: i) \n\ncutting and burning of native vegetation at the time of pasture establishment, where CO2 and \n\nN volatile forms losses may occur through several mechanisms due to combustion (JUO; \n\nMANU, 1996); ii) exposure and SOM respiration due to soil disturbance by tillage (FELLER; \n\nBEARE, 1997; SIX; ELLIOTT; PAUSTIAN, 2000); iii) soil erosion and runoff (FELLER; \n\nBEARE, 1997; ZHANG; WANG; LI, 2015) and mineral N leaching (McGRATH et al., \n\n2001); iv) low productivity of degraded pasture associated with continuous grazing and \n\nreduced organic litter inputs to the soil (MAIA et al., 2009; ASSAD et al., 2013; \n\nCARVALHO et al., 2014), typical characteristics of the Brazilian pasturelands as those here \n\nstudied.  \n\nImpacts of LUC from pasture to sugarcane on SOC and NT are still little reported in \n\nthe literature (ROSSI et al., 2013; MELLO et al., 2014). Our findings showed that a short-\n\nterm (<5 years) transition from pasture to sugarcane, as observed at the Lat_17 and Lat_21S \n\n(Table 2; Figure 4) did not promote SOC losses for the 0-30 cm layer. On the other hand, \n\nlong-term (>20 years) sugarcane production led to important SOC losses at Lat_23S. This \n\nSOC depletions can be associated to several causes, such as soil tillage performed for \n\nplanting, fertilization and sugarcane reformation (MELLO et al., 2014), long period of time \n\n(~10 years) with burning sugarcane harvesting system (CERRI et al., 2011; BORDONAL; \n\nFIGUEIREDO; LA SCALA JR, 2012; BRANDANI et al., 2015) and the recent crop residue \n\nremoval for electricity production (CARVALHO et al., 2013). At Lat_17S were observed \n\nhigher SOC and TN content under sugarcane than pasture. These results are due to the effects \n\nof LUC, but also influenced by differences in soil texture (Table 1) between pasture area \n\n(lower clay content) and the others land uses of the same chronosequence. Clay content is one \n\nof the major controlling factors to protect, stabilize and storage organic C in the tropical soils \n\n(FELLER; BEARE, 1997).  \n\nOur findings showed SOC and NT losses in regional scale as response of LUC effects. \n\nThese results agree with results reported in a global meta-analysis conducted by Don, \n\n\n\n 43 \n\nSchumacher and Freibauer (2011), and measured effects reported by Assad et al. (2013) and \n\nMello et al. (2014). Both SOC and TN are broadly recognized as key indicators of soil \n\nquality/health (DORAN; PARKIN, 1994; VEZZANI; MIELNICZUK, 2009; CARDOSO et \n\nal., 2013; ZORNOZA et al., 2015); therefore our data suggest that improved management \n\npractices are needed to prevent or minimize negative impact of sugarcane production on soil \n\nquality and other ecosystem services. \n\n \n\n2.4.2 Land-use change effects on acidity attributes and CECpH7 \n\n \n\nThe high soil acidity found in all studied sites (Table 3) can be attributed to the natural \n\nacidity that is characteristic of highly weathered soils, such as Oxisols and Ultisols in Brazil. \n\nThese low pH soils are associated with soil acidification processes driven by management \n\npractices (ANJOS et al., 2012). In croplands, soil acidity is increased by several factors, such \n\nas: uptake of basic cations by crops and removal of these during harvesting; inadequate soil \n\nmanagement favoring erosion and exposure of subsurface soil horizons (more acidic); the use \n\nof N fertilizers, and through the oxidation of S and SOM (SOUZA; MIRANDA; OLIVEIRA, \n\n2007). \n\nSoil acidity may have been strongly neutralized through native vegetation burning and \n\nash deposition on the soil surface (JUO; MANU, 1996; NGO-MBOGBA; YEMEFACK; \n\nNYECK, 2015). It seems to be the major reason of higher pH values in native vegetation at \n\nLat_21S. However, these effects were not observed after more than 30 years of burning in the \n\nconversion from native vegetation to pasture. Thereby, these results would indicate that over \n\ntime pasture land use reduced pH, BS and the exchangeable cations (Ca and Mg). Soil acidity \n\nreductions and increases of Ca and Mg (Tables 3 and 4) observed in sugarcane fields are due \n\nto management with applications of lime during the sugarcane conversion, and each \n\nsubsequent reformation cycle every 5-6 years (Table 2). Therefore, the sugarcane expansion \n\nunder pasture still requires liming, because sugarcane-growing recommendations states a BS \n\n? 60% requirement (RAIJ et al., 1997), and in pasture soils (land use prior to sugarcane) these \n\nBS values are lower (<10% at Lat_17S; ~25% at Lat_21S; ~50% at Lat_23S). \n\nSoil CECpH7 refers to the amount of negative charges at pH 7, which is not affected by \n\naddition of lime and fertilizer. Thus, CECpH7 is dependent upon the soil mineralogy and SOM \n\ncontent. Tropical soils, as those here studied, are dominated by variable-charge minerals with \n\nlow CEC. Therefore, SOM is very important for the nutrient status of the soils, since its lower \n\nthe point of zero charge and increase of CEC (FELLER; BEARE, 1997; ZECH et al., 1997). \n\n\n\n 44 \n\nIt is confirmed in our dataset, where SOC and NT were strongly correlated with CECpH7, r = \n\n0.83 (Table 6). Thus, depletions of SOM as response to LUC effects found in these areas \n\n(FRANCO et al., 2015) led to reductions of CECpH7 from native vegetation to pasture and \n\nsugarcane.  \n\n \n\n2.4.3 Land-use change effects on macro- and micro- nutrients  \n\n \n\nThe higher K contents were found under pasture soils (Table 4). It could be attributed \n\nto the heavy cycling, where up to 90% of the K taken up by plants is returned to the soil \n\nthrough of urine and feces (KAYSER; ISSELSTEIN, 2005) and low K losses from the system \n\n(extensive cattle with low stocking rate). The cycling of K in deeper soil layers and release of \n\nnon-exchangeable K forms by aggressive root system of grasses. The external inputs of K \n\nfertilizers to degraded pasture (Lat_21S) also increase K, in addition to the increases from the \n\nmineral animal feed supplements fed to cattle. In the native vegetation and sugarcane soils the \n\nK content were not significantly different, demonstrating that the application of mineral K \n\nfertilizers and organic residues (rich in K), such as vinasse (CHRISTOFOLETTI et al., 2013) \n\nto sugarcane maintains K levels equal to those found under native vegetation, despite \n\nsignificant K export in harvested sugarcane biomass.  \n\nOverall, low available P contents were found in all land uses studied (Table 4), \n\ncharacteristic of the tropical soils. According to Novais, Smyth and Nunes (2007) increases in \n\nthe weathering degree leads to gradual changes in soil characteristics, resulting in increases of \n\npositives charge and ability of soil to adsorb and retain anions, such as phosphates. Under \n\nthese conditions, P is strongly adsorbed (inner sphere complex) in Fe and Al oxides and \n\nkaolinites (FONTES; WEED, 1996; NOVAIS; SMYTH; NUNES, 2007), which is the \n\npredominant clay mineralogy in these study sites. \n\nThe LUC from native vegetation to pasture promoted available P contents depletions \n\n(Table 4). Recently a large regional survey in Brazil also concluded that LUC from native \n\nvegetation to extensive pasture led to decreases of available P stocks in the soil (GROPPO et \n\nal., 2015). This decrease may be associated with P exploitation over time by grazing cattle \n\nand absence of P fertilizer inputs. Several studies state that P plant-availability in pasture is \n\nstrongly dependent on the mineralization of the P organic pools (AGUIAR et al., 2013; \n\nFONTES et al., 2014; NASH et al., 2014). Therefore, the pronounced SOM depletions in \n\nthese sites (Figures 5 and 6), can be explains the severe degradation process of the Brazilian \n\npasturelands. Available P increases in the transition from pasture to cropland (sugarcane in \n\n\n\n 45 \n\nthis study) is frequently reported in the literature (NEGASSA; LEINWEBER, 2009), as \n\nresponse to application of mineral phosphate fertilizers. However, despite this increase (Table \n\n4), the amount of P available to support sugarcane growth was not enhanced, since the levels \n\nwere lower than the recommended 15 mg kg\n-1 \n\ncritical level (RAIJ et al., 1997). \n\nAvailable P depletion observed in sugarcane soil at Lat_23S may be due to application \n\nof only organic residues (filtercake, boiler ash and vinasse) from sugarcane industry (Table 2). \n\nThese organic residues could be releasing available P to plants below that is removed in the \n\nharvested biomass, and probably, accumulating P in other organic and/or inorganic fractions \n\nthat are less available in the soil. Therefore, future studies fractionating P forms will be \n\ncrucial for understanding LUC impacts on plant-available P dynamics in the soil, and perhaps, \n\nidentify indicator fractions for these effects (AGUIAR et al., 2013). \n\nS-sulphate content depletions from native vegetation to pasture and from pasture to \n\nsugarcane (Table 4) are associated with i) native vegetation burning at the moment of \n\nconversion, where losses occur by volatilization of S (JUO; MANU, 1996), ii) reduction of \n\norganic matter inputs in the soil iii) SOM decreases with more intensive soil tillage in \n\nsugarcane fields. Practically the entire available S-sulphate in the soil comes from biological \n\nprocess of mineralization of SOM (ALVAREZ et al., 2007). Thus, SOM changes have a \n\ndirect effect on the availability of S in the soil (KIRKBY et al., 2011). The SOC and NT \n\nlosses induced by the LUC confirm the close linkage between S-sulphate and SOM.  \n\nSoil micronutrient availability is affected by several factors, such as: soil acidity; \n\nSOM; P availability; moisture, texture, soil mineralogy (Fe, Al and Mn oxides), land \n\nmanagement and fertilization (WEI et al., 2006; ABREU; LOPES; SANTOS, 2007; \n\nSARKAR et al., 2014). Except the soil mineralogy and texture, these other factors are \n\nintensively affected by LUC process, modifying the availability of soil micronutrients to \n\nplants. The associated decrease in SOM in these areas (Figures 5 and 6) could be driving our \n\nobserved decrease in B (Table 5), which has been shown to correlate with SOM, Fe and Mn \n\noxides (SARKAR et al., 2014). The Cu, Mn, Fe and Zn responses to the LUC, with higher \n\ncontents in pasture soils (Table 5), most likely is due to acidification process in these soils, \n\nwhich increase strongly their soil availability (ABREU; LOPES; SANTOS, 2007). The \n\nrelationship between these micronutrients and acidity attributes was confirmed in this study \n\n(Table 6). \n\n \n\n\n\n 46 \n\n2.4.4 Soil chemical quality and its implications for sugarcane expansion \n\n \n\nSoil chemical quality assessments are crucial to quantify the soil\u2019s capacity to provide \n\nnutrients for adequate plant growth. Our findings suggest that LUC promoted significant \n\neffects on soil chemical properties (Figure 7) and consequently on soil chemical quality. \n\nSummarily, conversion from native vegetation to pasture promoted the following effects: i) \n\nhigh depletions of soil attributes related to SOM content (i.e., SOC, TN, P, S, B and CECpH7); \n\nii) soil acidification process with decrease of pH, BS and exchange cations (Ca and Mg); iii) \n\nincrease of metallic micronutrients availability (i.e., Cu, Mn, Fe and Zn). Therefore, \n\nconversion from native vegetation to pasture reduced the soil\u2019s capacity to support plant \n\ngrowth and productivity over time.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7 - Scores of the soil chemical attributes (0-30 cm layer) under land-use change \n\n(native vegetation - pasture - sugarcane) in central-southern Brazil. Mean values were \nrelativized and transformed in scores ranging from 0 to 1, so for each soil attribute the land use that \n\nhad the highest value received score 1 and other land uses received proportional values \n\n \n\n \n\nConversion from pasture to sugarcane resulted in a partial recovery of soil chemical \n\nquality on a relatively short timescale (<5 years) due to the successive applications of lime \n\nand fertilizers. Despite that, increments of available P and soil correction to BS ?60% are \n\nnecessary to achieve ideal soil chemical conditions to sugarcane growth. Although, there was \n\na decrease in soil micronutrient availability, the amount of available micronutrients to support \n\nplant growth was enhanced. Overall the LUC from pasture to sugarcane results in SOM \n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\npH\n\nBS\n\nH+Al\n\nMg\n\nCa\n\nK\n\nSOC\n\nTN\n\nCEC\n\nP\n\nS\n\nB\n\nCu\n\nFe\n\nMn\n\nZn\n\nNative vegetation\n\nPasture\n\nSugarcane\n\n\n\n 47 \n\nlosses, as also reported by Mello et al. (2014). However, the payback time for these losses is \n\nshort and overall it delivers substantial greenhouse gas emission savings when sugarcane \n\nethanol is used to displace fossil based fuels (EGESKOG et al., 2014; MELLO et al., 2014). \n\nBased on our findings that indicated SOC losses in regional scale as response of LUC effects, \n\nassociated to strong relationship among SOC with other soil chemical properties verified in \n\nthis study, we conclude that SOC is an important indicator of soil degradation and could be \n\nuseful for assessing soil quality in the sugarcane fields in Brazil. \n\nTherefore, our study indicated that management strategies are necessary to maintain \n\nand/or improve the soil chemical quality and the sustainability of sugarcane production in \n\nBrazil. Mechanized harvesting associated with reduced tillage and maintenance of sugarcane \n\nstraw on soil surface are key-factors to increase soil C sequestration, nutrient-cycling and \n\nimprove soil quality in sugarcane fields (CERRI et al., 2011; BORDONAL; FIGUEIREDO; \n\nLA SCALA JR, 2012; BRANDANI et al., 2015). In addition, fertilization using organic \n\nresidues from sugarcane industry (e.g., vinasse and filter cake) could be a feasible alternative \n\nto increase SOM (BRANDANI et al., 2015) and provide nutrients, especially K and P \n\n(CHRISTOFOLETTI et al., 2013; PRADO; CAIONE; CAMPOS, 2013) reducing the \n\nproduction costs with mineral fertilizers (ALMEIDA JUNIOR et al., 2011; SILVA; BONO; \n\nPEREIRA, 2014). \n\n \n\n2.5 Conclusions \n\n \n\nOur findings showed that long-term LUC from native vegetation to extensive pasture \n\ndecreases SOC, TN, available P, S, Ca, Mg and B contents. In addition, the LUC induces to \n\nsoil acidification and decrease of CECpH7, indicating that pasture areas have poor soil \n\nchemical quality in the primary sugarcane producing region of Brazil. \n\nConversion from pasture to sugarcane leads to increase of macronutrients levels and \n\nreduction of soil acidity due to inputs of lime and fertilizers, improving soil fertility. Despite \n\nthat, increments of available P and BS are necessary to achieve ideal soil chemical conditions \n\nto sugarcane growth. Decreases of available metallic micronutrients as response to soil acidity \n\ncorrection in sugarcane fields are not limiting to plants growth. Short-time (<5 years) \n\nconversion from pasture to sugarcane had no significant impacts on SOC and NT contents; \n\nhowever, after 20 years of sugarcane production significant losses were quantified. In regional \n\nscale, conversion from pasture to sugarcane induced 18 and 10% losses of the SOC and NT, \n\nrespectively, for the 0-30 cm layer. \n\n\n\n 48 \n\nOverall, it is expected that sugarcane expansion in Brazil replacing areas currently \n\noccupied with pastures will promote improvement on soil chemical quality. Despite this, \n\nsugarcane expansion can be associated with management strategies to increase SOM and \n\nimprove the soil fertility, reducing the environmental and economic costs associated with \n\nethanol production in Brazil. \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\nABREU, C.A.; LOPES, A.S.; SANTOS, G.C.G.

Phosphorus (P) depletion is one of the \n\nmost frequent causes of land degradation in tropical environments, and as such, soil P pools \n\nhave been identified as potential indicators of negative environmental impacts. We quantified \n\nsoil P dynamics for the most common LUC sequence in sugarcane expansion areas (i.e., \n\nnative vegetation to pasture to sugarcane), to determine if and how these changes could be \n\nused to evaluate environmental impacts of LUC in weathered Brazilian soils. Soil samples \n\nwere collected from three areas in central-southern Brazil, representing the primary \n\nsugarcane-producing region of the world. Soil P fractionation was performed, and P stocks \n\nwere calculated for the surface 30 cm. Soil chemical attributes and macrofauna data were \n\ncorrelated with P pools. Long-term conversion from natural ecosystems (Cerrado and Atlantic \n\nforest biome) to extensive pasture decreased total P stocks by 31.2% indicating progressive \n\nsoil degradation in these areas. In contrast, the LUC from pasture to sugarcane increased total \n\nP stocks by 35.6%; nevertheless, fertilization management altered the soil P-cycle, causing P \n\naccumulation in less plant-available forms. Available P increases to support adequate \n\nsugarcane growth are still needed. Applying P using organic residues increased labile organic \n\nP and may be a complementary strategy for increasing nutrient supplies in sugarcane fields. \n\nPhosphorus availability showed significant positive correlations with other soil chemical \n\nproperties and clay content, while the functional diversity of soil macrofauna was strongly \n\ncorrelated with labile and biological P. We conclude that P pools can be useful indicators for \n\nassessing LUC modifications on soil quality in the tropics, and recommend they be used to \n\nassess land degradation and environmental sustainability within sugarcane expansion areas in \n\nBrazil. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Sugarcane production; Environmental sustainability; Phosphorus fractionation; \n\nSoil quality indicators; Soil macrofauna \n\n \n\n3.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nThe global expansion of bioenergy crops has brought attention to the potential \n\nenvironmental impacts resulting from land-use changes (LUC) (ROWE; STREET; TAYLOR, \n\n2009; WRIGHT; WIMBERLY, 2013; MUKHERJEE; SOVACOOL, 2014; WALTER et al., \n\n2014; ANAYA; HUBER-SANNWALD, 2015). In Brazil, the largest sugarcane ethanol \n\nproducer in the world, the area growing sugarcane expanded by 3.2 Mha between 2005 and \n\n2015, totalizing approx. 9.1 Mha (COMPANHIA BRASILEIRA DE ABASTECIMENTO, \n\n2015). However, Brazil will need an additional 6.4 Mha of sugarcane to meet domestic \n\nethanol demand in 2021 (GOLDEMBERG et al., 2014). This additional area will primarily \n\n\n\n 56 \n\ncome from areas that are currently in pasture (LAPOLA et al., 2010; GOLDEMBERG et al., \n\n2014; WALTER et al., 2014). \n\nSoil quality has been identified as a key environmental component for evaluating the \n\nsustainability of biofuel expansion (BETTER SUGAR CANE INITIATIVE, 2011; GLOBAL \n\nBIOENERGY PARTNERSHIP, 2011). Studies have been conducted to identify soil \n\nproperties and processes that are suitable for evaluating soil quality, soil degradation and their \n\nimpact on ecosystem services. Soil organic matter (SOM) depletion (DON; SCHUMACHER; \n\nFREIBAUER, 2011; MELLO et al., 2014; FRANCO et al., 2015) and loss of soil nutrients \n\nsuch as phosphorus (P) associated with the SOM (MacDONALD; BENNETT; TARANU, \n\n2012; AGUIAR et al., 2013; HAMER et al., 2013; FONTE et al., 2014; FRANCO et al., \n\n2015; NESPER et al., 2015) have been appointed as important indicators of soil quality \n\ndegradation. Phosphorus is an important indicator, especially in tropical regions, because it is \n\na major limiting factor for plant growth (ELSER et al., 2007; SHEN et al., 2011; \u00c5GREN; \n\nWETTERSTEDT; BILLBERGER, 2012; ELSER, 2012).  \n\nSoil macroinvertebrates, such as beetles, termites and earthworms can improve the \n\navailability of essential nutrients to plants in tropical soils (OU\u00c9DRAOGO et al., 2005; \n\nCHAPUIS-LARDY et al., 2011; SEYMOUR et al., 2014). Studies have shown that \n\nmacrofauna can significantly change the biogeochemical P cycle in the soil, usually leading to \n\nhigher soil P availability (LE BAYON; BINET, 2006; CHAPUIS-LARDY et al., 2011). \n\nTherefore, LUC processes that induce deleterious effects on soil biodiversity probably also \n\nhave adverse implications on P availability. Developing a better understanding of soil P \n\ndynamics in tropical soils undergoing LUC is necessary, not only to improve P-use efficiency, \n\nbut also to reduce environmental risks (SHEN et al., 2011; MacDONALD et al., 2011; \n\nELSER, 2012; STUTTER et al., 2015). \n\nSoil P is present in organic and inorganic forms, ranging from ionic forms in solution \n\nto highly stable compounds with SOM and/or clayey minerals (NEGASSA; LEINWEBER, \n\n2009; SHEN et al., 2011). Organic P (Po) is associated with soil microbial biomass and SOM, \n\nand generally includes compounds such as phosphomonoesters, phosphodiesters and organic \n\npolyphosphates (NASH et al., 2014; STUTTER et al., 2015). These compounds vary in P \n\navailability based on the degree of recalcitrance. Soil inorganic P (Pi) is primarily linked to \n\namorphous and crystalline forms of iron (Fe), aluminum (Al) and calcium (Ca), and account \n\nfor a large proportion of total soil P in tropical soils (FONTES; WEED, 1996; NOVAIS; \n\nSMYTH; NUNES, 2007; GAMA-RODRIGUES et al., 2014). Unfortunately, much of this P \n\nis unavailable for plant uptake. \n\n\n\n 57 \n\nThe distribution of P between organic and inorganic compounds varies, reflecting soil \n\nuse and composition of both natural ecosystems and agroecosystems (WRIGHT, 2009; \n\nAGUIAR et al., 2013; CREWS; BROOKES, 2014). Therefore, P fractionation and grouping \n\ninto chemically defined pools, such as labile, moderately labile and non-labile (organic and \n\ninorganic) is useful for quantifying the fate of native and applied P in both systems (CROSS; \n\nSCHLESINGER, 1995; NEGASSA; LEINWEBER, 2009; WRIGHT, 2009; RISKIN et al., \n\n2013; CREWS; BROOKES, 2014). Similarly, the distribution and dynamics of P pools can \n\nalso be used to predict the effects of LUC on soil quality and to determine potential \n\nlimitations when establishing new land uses (AGUIAR et al., 2013).  \n\nIn a recent study, the microbe and plant-available P pool was not significantly affected \n\nby LUC in sugarcane expansion areas (FRANCO et al., 2015). The findings of Franco et al. \n\n(2015) also suggest that quantifying only the labile forms of P may not be suitable for \n\nassessing LUC effects on P dynamics in tropical soils, and that less labile forms of P can \n\nbetter elucidate LUC effects. Our objective was to quantify effects of the most common LUC \n\nsequence associated with sugarcane expansion (i.e., native vegetation to pasture to sugarcane), \n\non soil P dynamics and thus determine environmental impacts of LUC on weathered Brazilian \n\nsoils. We hypothesized that LUC from natural to anthropogenic ecosystems would result in \n\nsoil P-pool modifications that could indicate soil degradation.  \n\n \n\n3.2 Material and Methods \n\n \n\n3.2.1 Study sites and experimental design  \n\n \n\nThe study sites and experimental design were described in the 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 items. \n\n \n\n3.2.2 Soil sampling and phosphorus fractionation  \n\n \n\nSoil sampling was completed in January 2013. At each land-use four repetitions \n\nconsisting of 12 subsamples each were collected from the 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm depth \n\naround the center point using a Dutch auger. Samples were sieved through a 2-mm screen and \n\ndried at 50 \u00b0C prior to P determinations. Other soil chemical properties and particle sizes were \n\nanalyzed and correlated with the P pools. Additionally, undisturbed soil samples were \n\ncollected to measure soil bulk density using a metal cylinder (height 5 cm x internal diameter \n\n\n\n 58 \n\n5 cm, approx. 100 cm\n-3\n\n). Those values were subsequently used to calculate the P stocks for \n\neach layer. \n\nPhosphorus pools were obtained by measuring inorganic P (Pi) and organic P (Po) as \n\ndescribed by Hedley, Stewart and Chauhan (1982) and subsequently modified by Condron, \n\nGoh and Newman, (1985). Phosphorus was extracted sequentially from dry 0.5-g soil samples \n\nin the following order: anion exchange resin membrane (Piresin fraction), 0.5 M of sodium \n\nbicarbonate (NaHCO3) (Pibic and Pobic fractions), 0.1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (Pihyd01 \n\nand Pohyd01 fractions), 1.0 M of chloridric acid (HCl) (PiHCl fraction) and 0.5 M of NaOH \n\n(Pihyd05 and Pohyd05 fractions). The remaining soil was oven dried and digested with H2SO4 + \n\nH2O2 (Presidual fraction) to determine residual P. Phosphorus concentrations in the acid extracts \n\nwere determined using the Murphy and Riley (1962) method. Inorganic P (Pi) fractions in the \n\nalkaline extracts (NaHCO3 and NaOH) were determined using the Dick and Tabatabai (1977) \n\nmethod. After determining total P in the alkaline extracts by digesting with ammonium \n\npersulfate + H2SO4 in an autoclave, organic P (Po) was estimated by calculating the difference \n\nbetween total P and Pi in the various fractions.  \n\nPhosphorus fractions obtained by the Hedley fractionation were grouped into pools \n\naccording to their plant availability as \u201cLabile P\u201d (Piresin + Pibic + Pobic), \u201cModerately labile P\u201d \n\n(Pihyd01 + Pohyd01 + PiHCl) and \u201cNon-labile P\u201d (Pihyd05 + Pohyd05 + Presidual). In addition, P \n\nfractions were grouped as proposed by Cross and Schlesinger (1995) into biological and \n\ngeochemical P pools, where the former includes all organic fractions (Pobic + Pohyd01 + Pohyd05) \n\nand the latter includes all inorganic fractions and residual P (Piresin + Pibic + PiHCl + Pihyd01 + \n\nPihyd05 + Presidual). \n\n \n\n3.2.3 Soil attributes and macrofauna variables  \n\n \n\nA dataset of soil chemical attributes and clay content provided by Cherubin et al. \n\n(2015)\n1\n was used to verify their correlation with soil P pools. Those measurements were made \n\non soil samples collected at the same sites and sampling times here reported for P \n\nfractionation. \n\nThe role of soil macroinvertebrates in mediating changes in P pools under the LUC \n\nscenarios was studied correlating data of soil P pools with data of macrofauna variables \n\nprovided by Franco (2015) at the same site and time studied here. Briefly, at each soil \n\n                                                 \n\n1\n Data presented in the chapter 2. \n\n\n\n 59 \n\nsampling point macrofauna numbers were determined using the standard Tropical Soil \n\nBiology and Fertility Institute soil monolith method (ANDERSON; INGRAM, 1993). Soil \n\nmonoliths (25 x 25 x 10 cm) were extracted from 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm soil layers and \n\nthe macrofauna were sorted immediately after sampling. The faunal density was calculated as \n\nthe number of individuals per surface unit (m\n2\n). Ecological indexes were calculated for \n\nassessing richness (Margalef\u2019s index), diversity (Shannon\u2019s index), evenness (Pielou\u2019s index) \n\nand dominance of species (Simpson`s index) according to the methods described by Magurran \n\n(2004). The functional diversity of sampled macrofauna was determined through of taxa \n\nclassification according to their ecological functions. This included species considered to be \n\nherbivorous (Dermaptera and Hemiptera), detritivorous (Blattodea, Diplopoda, Diptera, \n\nGastropoda, Isopoda, Isoptera and Oligochaeta) or predators (Aranae, Chilopoda, Coleoptera, \n\nFormicidae, Hymenoptera and Scorpiones) (BROWN et al., 2001; JEFFERY et al., 2010). \n\n \n\n3.2.4 Data analyses  \n\n \n\nThe P stocks were calculated for each sampling point by multiplying P concentrations \n\nby soil bulk density and layer thickness (10 cm) before averaging the values for each site. \n\nPhosphorus stocks within pasture and sugarcane sites were adjusted to an equivalent soil mass \n\ncorresponding native vegetation to measure effects of LUC on soil bulk density (LEE et al., \n\n2009). An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was computed using PROC GLM procedure to test \n\nthe influence of the LUC within each site on P pools. If the ANOVA was significant (p<0.05), \n\nthe means were compared using Tukey\u2019s test (p<0.05). An additional ANOVA was computed \n\nto test the LUC effects in regional scale (global average at the results found at the three \n\nlocations). In this case, each site was considered a block. Means were also compared using \n\nTukey\u2019s test (p<0.05). A Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis (p<0.01 and p<0.05) was performed \n\nusing PROC CORR procedure among P pools, soil chemical attributes and clay content. A \n\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) was also performed using PROC FACTOR procedure \n\nto visualize the relationship between P pools and soil macrofauna variables. All statistical \n\nanalyses were completed using the Statistical Analysis System \u2013 SAS v.9.3 (SAS Inc., Cary, \n\nUSA). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 60 \n\n3.3 Results \n\n \n\n3.3.1 Dynamic of P fraction levels under land-use change  \n\n \n\nSoil P fractions in native vegetation, pasture and sugarcane land uses at the three sites \n\nare presented in Table 1. Although labile P fractions showed site-specific responses, there was \n\nan increasing trend within these fractions in sugarcane fields at Lat_17S and Lat_21S, \n\npresumably in response to mineral phosphate fertilization. However, Presin levels, the plant-\n\navailable fraction used as a diagnostic for soil fertility, were very low, averaged 4.21, 8.63 \n\nand 3.64 mg kg\n-1 \n\nfor the 0-30 cm soil layer at Lat_17S, Lat_21S and Lat_23S, respectively. \n\nFurthermore, this fraction represented between 0.4 to 2.0% of the total soil P. At Lat_23S \n\nthere was much less inorganic P in labile fractions (Presin and Pibic) within sugarcane soil than \n\nwithin native vegetation or pasture soils (Table 1). However, use of organic wastes as \n\nfertilizers for sugarcane production increased the Pobic fraction (labile pool), which was higher \n\nthan in native vegetation and pasture, but does not ensure adequate soil Presin levels for the \n\nsugarcane crop. \n\nLong-term conversion from native vegetation to extensive pasture depleted soil P \n\nlevels, especially for moderately labile (Pihyd01, Pohyd01 and PiHCl) and non-labile (Pihyd05, \n\nPohyd05 and Presidual) P fractions; this depletion occurred at both Lat_17S and Lat_21S sites \n\n(Table 1). Sugarcane cultivation increased total P to levels similar or higher than those within \n\nnative vagetation as a consequence of successive mineral and organic P fertilizer inputs. \n\nFertilizer P in sugarcane areas was distributed among all P fractions, but the main effect was \n\nto mineral-associated fractions (inorganic P) which are strongly adsorbed and have low plant-\n\navailability (moderately and non-labile P fractions).   \n\n\n\n 61 \n\nTable 1 - Phosphorus fraction levels (mg kg\n-1\n\n) under land-use change (native vegetation - NV, pasture - PA and sugarcane - SC) in central-\n\nsouthern Brazil \n\nP Fractions \nSoil  \n\nLayer \n\nLat_17S \nCV% \n\nLat_21S \nCV% \n\nLat_23S \nCV% \n\nNV PA SC NV PA SC NV PA SC \n\n Labile P fractions   \n\nP_resin \n 0-10     3.85 b* 6.77 a 4.08 ab 29 9.19 b 6.01 b       13.34 a 17 11.64 a 10.73 a 3.88 b 29 \n\n10-20       3.70 a 4.77 a         4.99 a 32 10.39 a 4.09 b   6.82 ab 29 8.01 a 7.25 a 3.78 b 37 \n\n20-30       2.57 b 4.21 a 3.55 ab 19 7.16 a 2.61 b         5.73 a 24 7.03 a 5.59 a 3.25 b 21 \n\nPi_bic \n 0-10 20.77 a 5.25 b 21.45 a 12      7.05 b 7.00 b 12.57 a 21 20.65 a 25.19 a 9.70 b 17 \n\n10-20 18.04 a 3.94 b 21.44 a 17 4.51 b 3.72 b 6.89 a 21 22.24 a 21.56 a 9.02 b 20 \n\n20-30 16.85 b 3.69 c 19.91 a 7 4.67 a 2.79 b 5.25 a 22 23.83 a 19.91 a 7.15 b 10 \n\nPo_bic \n 0-10      1.85 c 27.94 a 9.41 b 36    32.54 a 33.54 a  38.87 a  19 10.74 b 10.72 b 23.82 a 21 \n\n10-20      5.00 b 25.74 a 9.42 b 21 33.57 a 26.28 a 38.16 a 19 17.66 b 3.85 c 25.56 a 19 \n\n20-30      8.34 a 9.52 a 10.41 a 39    33.80 a 27.95 a 32.67 a 26 8.09 b 12.01 b 21.05 a 29 \n\nModerately Labile P fractions  \n\nPi_hyd0.1 \n 0-10 58.06 a 0.90 b 62.33 a 10    32.46 a 37.07 a 28.14 a 14 59.85 b 68.04 ab 83.37 a 12 \n\n10-20 53.30 b 0.70 c 72.06 a 18   24.27 b 34.74 a 21.89 b 16 58.81 b    58.06 b 86.55 a 18 \n\n20-30 55.98 a 0.53 b 62.33 a 11    23.37 a 22.93 a 19.21 a 16 41.98 b    51.21 b 75.18 a 14 \n\nPo_hyd0.1 \n 0-10 30.60 b 2.55 c 72.64 a 22 41.05 b  58.85 b 89.13 a 18 183.03 a 99.29 b 42.66 c 28 \n\n10-20 21.02 b 1.56 c 69.56 a 22 79.69 a 30.25 b 99.22 a 26 86.84 a 68.68 a 24.69 b 29 \n\n20-30 18.55 b 1.00 c 57.05 a 28 79.38 a 43.98 b 91.68 a 21 92.88 a 78.16 a 33.60 b 12 \n\nPi_HCl \n 0-10 2.38 b 0.42 c 4.50 a 31 10.13 a 7.93 a 14.17 a 33 7.94 b 14.02 a 14.81 a 25 \n\n10-20 2.31 b 0.23 c 4.76 a 43 9.99 a 4.23 b 8.17 a 42 7.08 a 10.25 a 11.60 a 26 \n\n20-30 2.12 b 0.21 c 4.03 a 28 7.93 a 3.67 b 6.63 a 22 7.47 a 10.65 a 12.57 a 27 \n\nNon-Labile P fractions  \n\nPi_hyd0.5 0-10 62.17 b 0.43 c 74.42 a 8 12.71 a 4.44 b 11.19 a 11 114.50 a 130.49 a 127.96 a 8 \n\n 10-20 59.60 a 0.32 b 62.92 a 32 10.13 a 3.63 b 9.48 a 19 100.03 a 102.25 a 90.55 b 5 \n\n 20-30 58.08 a 0.20 b 54.91 a 35 8.62 b 6.25 c 12.10 a 13 101.85 b 96.60 b 135.98 a 14 \n\nPo_hyd0.5 0-10 29.82 b 63.33 a 73.25 a 17 125.49 a 61.84 b 79.40 b 20 29.08 a 11.42 a 33.17 a 67 \n\n 10-20 41.77 b 99.92 a 78.44 ab 30 129.11 a 63.73 b 120.21 a 33 19.97 b 36.64 b 72.40 a 37 \n\n 20-30 49.67 b 114.46 a 81.12 ab 31 162.58 a 83.30 b 98.56 b 26 45.32 a 31.93 a 20.96 a 56 \n\nP_residual \n0-10 243.93 b 77.59 b 328.82 a 20 233.51 a 148.94 b 202.70 a 23 654.40 a 536.80 a 667.19 a 18 \n\n10-20 232.35 b 67.43 b 356.24 a 27 217.93 ab 146.50 b 259.97 a 26 680.19 a 602.61 a 615.20 a 19 \n\n20-30 268.71 a 71.29 b 402.75 a 33 299.37 a 232.62 a 282.31 a 16 690.75 a 582.09 a 592.45 a 19 \n\nTotal P  \n\nP_total \n0-10 453.42 b 185.17 c 650.89 a 10 504.11 a 365.61 b 489.52 ab 14 1091.82 a 906.70 a 1006.46 a 11 \n\n10-20 437.09 b 204.60 c 679.83 a 15 519.59 a 317.16 b 570.79 a 11 1000.83 a 911.15 a 939.34 a 14 \n\n20-30 480.86 b 205.11 c 696.07 a 19 626.91 a 426.09 b 554.14 ab 12 1019.21 a 888.17 a 902.19 a 11 \n\n*Mean values in line within each site followed by the same letter do not differ among themselves according to Tukey\u2019s test (p<0.05). \n\n\n\n 62 \n\n3.3.2 Labile, moderately labile and non-labile P pool stocks \n\n \n\nLabile P (0-30 cm) showed few significant differences among land uses. The native \n\nvegetation (Cerrado biome) at Lat_17S (Figure 1A) had lower labile P stocks (82 kg ha\n-1\n\n) than \n\nthe pasture (110 kg ha\n-1\n\n) and sugarcane (108 kg ha\n-1\n\n) areas. At Lat_21S (Figure 1B), P stocks \n\nat pasture sites (122 kg ha\n-1\n\n) were significantly lower than native vegetation (150 kg ha\n-1\n\n) and \n\nsugarcane (177 kg ha\n-1\n\n). Labile P stocks were not affected by the three land uses studied \n\nwithin the Lat_23S (Figure 1C), nor were they different on the regional scale (Figure 1D) \n\naveraging 94 and 115 kg ha\n-1\n\n, respectively. Therefore, in general, labile P stocks showed no \n\nchange over time, although there was a small decreasing trend due to conversion from native \n\nvegetation to pasture and a slight increase with the conversion from pasture to sugarcane \n\n(Figure 2A). The labile P pool represents a small portion of total P reserves (Figure 1E), with \n\nrelative contributions ranging from 5 (sugarcane) to 18% (pasture) at Lat_17S; 9 (native \n\nvegetation) to 11% (pasture and sugarcane) at Lat_21S; and a mean of 4% for all land uses at \n\nLat_23S. Considering the three sites, the average values ranged from 6 (native vegetation and \n\nsugarcane) to 8% (pasture) (Figure 1F).  \n\nThe LUC effects were higher for P stocks in more recalcitrant pools, such as \n\nmoderately labile and non-labile fractions. The LUC from native vegetation to pasture \n\npromoted a significant depletion (36%) in moderately labile P stocks (from 333 to 214 kg ha\n-\n\n1\n) and 32% depletion in non-labile P stocks (from 1422 to 961 kg ha\n\n-1\n) at the regional scale \n\n(Figure 1D). Overall, the change rates of moderately labile and non-labile P stocks due to \n\nconversion from native vegetation to pasture were -3.6 and -14.0 kg ha\n-1\n\nyr\n-1\n\n, respectively \n\n(Figure 2A). The LUC from pasture to sugarcane affected moderately labile and non-labile P \n\npools differently at the three sites (Figure 1A-C), but in general, the results show a significant \n\nincrease in the less labile forms in sugarcane soils (Lat_17S and Lat_21S). At the regional \n\nscale, these results were confirmed (Figure 1D), indicating that replacing pasture with \n\nsugarcane significantly increased moderately labile (39.5 kg ha\n-1\n\nyr\n-1\n\n)\n \nand non-labile (101.9 kg \n\nha\n-1\n\nyr\n-1\n\n)\n \nP stocks (Figure 2B). We highlighted that part of this high P accumulation rates for \n\nregional scale are due to higher rates found at Lat_17S (Figure 2B), where pasture soil \n\npresents less clay content than sugarcane soil.    \n\n\n\n 63 \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1 - Labile, moderately labile and non-labile phosphorus stocks (0-30 cm soil layer) at \n\nthree sites: A) Lat_17S, B) Lat_21S, C) Lat_23S and D) regional scale, and the \n\nrelative contribution of each pool in the total P stock: E) at the three sites and F) on \n\na regional scale, under land-use change (native vegetation - NV, pasture - PA, and \n\nsugarcane - SC) in central-southern Brazil.

For example, 33 years after native \n\nvegetation was converted to pasture, P depletions ranged from 1,388 to 600 kg ha\n-1\n\n (-56.7%) \n\nat Lat_17S, from 1,752 to 1,095 kg ha\n-1\n\n (-37.5%) at Lat_21S, and from 2,457 to 2,154 kg ha\n-1\n\n \n\n(-12.3%) at Lat_23S (Figure 3A). Considering the three sites together, in a regional scale, the \n\naverage total P stock decreased from 1,866 in native vegetation soils to 1,283 kg ha\n-1\n\n in \n\npasture soils. This total P decrease (-31.2%) occurred at an average rate of -18 kg ha\n-1\n\nyr\n-1 \n\n(Figure 2C). Conversion of pasture to sugarcane increased total P stocks at all sites (Figure \n\n3A). At the regional scale, total P stocks increased from 1,283 in pasture soils to 1,992 kg ha\n-1\n\n \n\nin sugarcane soils (Figure 3C) at an average rate of 145.6 kg ha\n-1\n\nyr\n-1 \n\n(Figure 2D). Therefore, \n\nsugarcane soils currently have similar or higher P stocks than under native vegetation.  \n\nThe relative proportion of biological and geochemical P pools within total P was \n\naffected by clay content (Figure 3B). Therefore, the P linked to organic composts had a higher \n\ncontribution to total P stocks within sandy soil at Lat_21S (ranging from 39 to 44%), than \n\nwithin clay soils at Lat_23S (ranging from 11 to 16%). On average, biological P accounted for \n\napproximately 25% of the total P, but when analyzed separately, biological P represented \n\nmore than 50% of labile and moderately labile P (Figure 4). Among the three land uses, \n\nbiological P accounted for 58, 55, and 45% of the labile P pool within pasture, sugarcane and \n\nnative vegetation sites, respectively.

Labile P was positively correlated with acidity \n\nattributes (BS, r = 0.51 and pH, r = 0.43), cations (Ca, r = 0.47; Mg, r = 0.44; K, r = 0.37), \n\nSOM (SOC, r = 0.23 and TN, r = 0.35) and CECpH7 (r = 0.33), but negatively (although not \n\nsignificantly) correlated with clay content.

Non-labile P was similar to the \n\nmoderately labile P, although it was not correlated with pH.

Although macrofauna variables were not \n\nassociated with the soil total P, taxonomic richness, macrofauna diversity and evenness were \n\nclosely and positively related to the labile P pool and biological P pool. Positive relationships \n\nwere also found between the functional diversity of the macrofaunal community (i.e., the \n\nnumber of functional groups found in a sample) and the biological and labile P pools. The \n\nfunctional diversity was associated with the biological variables richness, diversity and \n\nevenness. In contrast, macrofauna density and dominance of species showed negative \n\ncorrelations with labile and biological P and with all the other biological variables. Total P \n\ncontent was strongly related with moderately-labile P, no-labile P and geochemical P pools. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 69 \n\n \n\nFigure 5 - Principal component analysis of the soil phosphorus pools (black lines) and \n\nmacrofauna variables (gray lines) \n\n \n\n3.4 Discussion \n\n \n\n3.4.1 Sugarcane expansion and its implications on P dynamic  \n\n \n\nLabile P fractions are the primary P source for plant growth, but those fractions \n\nrepresented less than 10% of the total soil P, which is similar to the proportion reported by \n\nRiskin et al. (2013) and Rodrigues et al. (2016). Overall, LUC from native vegetation to \n\npasture had no significant effect in labile P pool (Figure 1D), although there was a decreasing \n\ntrend within this pool for the Presin fraction, as reported by Cherubin et al. (2015). Another \n\nlarge, paired-comparison study recently carried out in Brazil (GROPPO et al., 2015) \n\nconcluded that LUC from native vegetation to well-managed pasture led to increase of plant-\n\navailable inorganic P. However, when assessed in a regional survey that better represented the \n\nstatus of the Brazilian extensive pastures (as those here studied) there were reductions of \n\nplant-available inorganic P stocks in pasture compared to native vegetation soils. \n\nLabile P \n\nModerately \n\nLabile P \n\nNon-Labile P \n\nBiological P \n\nGeochemical P \n\nTotal P \n\nDensity \n\nRichness \n\nEvenness \n\nDiversity \n\nDominance \n\nFunctional \n\nDiversity \n\n-1.0\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n-1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0\n\nP\nC\n\n 2\n (\n\n3\n1\n\n.2\n%\n\n) \n\nPC 1 (38.8%) \n\n\n\n 70 \n\nThe conversion of natural ecosystems or pastures for agricultural purposes in tropical \n\nsoils generally increases labile P pool due to low native P levels in natural ecosystem/pastures \n\nand inputs by phosphate fertilizers, as reported by Negassa and Leinweber (2009). The \n\nassumption that increasing pH increases plant-available P (HAYNES, 1984) was also \n\nconfirmed by positive correlations between labile P and acidity attributes (Table 2). Our \n\nfindings are in line with several studies carried out in Brazil. Pavinato, Merlin and Rosolem \n\n(2009) and Rodrigues et al. (2016) indicated that P applied through phosphate fertilization \n\nincreased the inorganic labile and moderately labile P fractions in Oxisols from the Brazilian \n\nCerrado. Aguiar et al. (2013) reported higher inorganic labile P levels under agricultural uses \n\n(alley cropping and no-tillage) compared to a newly cleared area, secondary Amazon forest \n\nand pasture.

Merr.] fields led to increased \n\ninorganic labile P and decreased organic labile P compared to native vegetation. Groppo et al. \n\n(2015) found significant higher inorganic labile P stocks for the top soil layer (0-30 cm) in \n\ncrop-livestock systems (49.50 kg ha\n-1\n\n) than in native vegetation (21.74 kg ha\n-1\n\n) in the Cerrado, \n\nAtlantic Forest, and Pampa biomes. \n\nThere was a higher contribution of organic P (58%) to the labile P pool for pasture \n\nareas (Table 1; Figure 4) representing significant P-recycling (COSTA et al., 2014; CREWS; \n\nBROOKES, 2014; FRANCO et al., 2015; STUTTER et al., 2015), where up to 85% of the P \n\ntaken up by plants is returned to the soil through animal dung (NASH et al., 2014) and \n\nassociated with greater soil biological activity (LAVELLE et al., 2014; FRANCO, 2015). \n\nThese results confirm the hypothesis reported in the literature that plant-available P in pasture \n\nis strongly dependent on mineralization of the Po pool (AGUIAR et al., 2013; HAMER et al., \n\n2013; CREWS; BROOKES, 2014; FONTE et al., 2014; NASH et al., 2014; FRANCO et al., \n\n2015; NESPER et al., 2015; STUTTER et al., 2015). Long-term experiments in the USA \n\n(MOTAVALLI; MILES, 2002) and England (CREWS; BROOKES, 2014) have shown that \n\nnative and perennial grass has capacity to maintain a greater proportion of native or fertilizer-\n\nP in relatively available organic forms compared to annual wheat (Triticum aestivum). These \n\nstudies supported that increased P availability is due to a transformation of stable residual P \n\ninto active Po. In addition, grazing appears to contribute to the regulation of labile P cycling \n\nin pasture conditions (COSTA et al., 2014). More recently, a large study carried out in the UK \n\n(STUTTER et al., 2015) found predominance of organic P forms (e.g., monoesters, diester, \n\npolyphosphates and other) in extensive grasslands soils, while inorganic P forms \n\n(orthophosphates) were more important in arable soils. Greater concentrations of microbial P \n\n\n\n 71 \n\nforms in extensive grassland indicate presence of an active microbial population efficient in \n\nturnover of soil organic P in conditions of limited readily available inorganic P (STUTTER et \n\nal., 2015). \n\nOverall, a depletion in P stocks was observed after 33 years of conversion from native \n\nvegetation to pasture, especially for the moderately and non-labile pools (Figures 1 and 2). \n\nThese decreases are the result of P exploitation over time due to grazing without any P \n\nfertilizer inputs (GROPPO et al., 2015). This further emphasizes that inappropriate \n\nmanagement of soil fertility by Brazilian farmers leads to soil degradation and becomes one \n\nof the major factors for low productivity (i.e., degraded pastures) in approximately 70% of \n\nBrazilian pasturelands (DIAS-FILHO, 2014; STRASSBURG et al., 2014). Recent studies \n\nstressed that soil structural degradation in pasture promotes a continuum of P depletions, \n\nespecially organic forms associated with SOM, confirming that similar mechanisms act in the \n\nprotection and stabilization of organic P and SOM in the soil (FONTE et al., 2014; NESPER \n\net al., 2015). Although the linkage between SOM and biological organic P levels was not \n\nsignificant in this study, we found a strong correlation between total P stock and SOM (Table \n\n2). \n\nExpansion of sugarcane over extensive pasture led to P accumulation in less labile P \n\npools, such as moderately labile and non-labile fractions (Figures 1 and 2), which are the \n\nprimary fates of P from fertilizers in soil (NEUFELDT et al., 2000; NEGASSA; \n\nLEINWEBER, 2009; PAVINATO; MERLIN; ROSOLEM, 2009; WRIGHT, 2009; SHEN et \n\nal., 2011; RISKIN et al., 2013; RODRIGUES et al., 2016). These finding are consistent with \n\nother studies, that have found higher P accumulation in mineral-associated fractions (P sinks), \n\nparticularly the Ca-bound fraction in temperate soils (CASTILHO; WRIGHT, 2008; \n\nNEGASSA; LEINWEBER, 2009; WRIGHT, 2009) as well as Fe- and Al-bound fractions in \n\ntropical soils (NEUFELDT et al., 2000; NEGASSA; LEINWEBER, 2009; PAVINATO; \n\nMERLIN; ROSOLEM, 2009; AGUIAR et al., 2013; RISKIN et al., 2013; RODRIGUES et \n\nal., 2016), such as the highly weathered soils evaluated in this study. When P from mineral \n\nfertilizers is added to soil it is quickly adsorbed or precipitated in mineral forms. First, an \n\nelectrostatic attraction (reversible) occurs between the P (orthophosphate) and soil minerals \n\n(NOVAIS; SMYTH; NUNES, 2007), primarily on the edges of silicates, crystalline Fe and Al \n\noxides, and amorphous Al oxides (FONTES; WEED, 1996). These attractions become \n\nstronger over time, and a specific adsorption or chemisorption (irreversible) occurs with a \n\nligand-exchange (NOVAIS; SMYTH; NUNES, 2007).  \n\n\n\n 72 \n\nAn analysis of global agricultural P budgets, based in input and output rates, showed \n\nthat the top quartile of P surpluses (accumulation in the soil) to be those with more than 13 kg \n\nha\n-1\n\nyr\n-1 \n\n(MacDONALD et al., 2011), indicating the high accumulation P rates found in our \n\nweathered Brazilian soils under sugarcane production (Figure 2) are among the highest P \n\naccumulation rates reported for world croplands. However, despite this high rate of total P \n\naccumulation, only a small amount was in labile forms (4.4 kg ha\n-1\n\nyr\n-1\n\n); consequently, the \n\namount of available P to support sugarcane growth was not enhanced [i.e., Presin levels (Table \n\n1) were lower than the recommended 15 mg kg\n-1 \n\ncritical level (ESPIRONELLO et al., 1997)]. \n\nIn terms of environmental impacts, although a large amount of P has being annually \n\naccumulated in the soil, the strong sorption capacity of these weathered soils suggests that \n\nLUC associated with agricultural expansion in Brazil has a low risk for P losses to waterways \n\n(RISKIN et al., 2013) and subsequent eutrophication of water resources. \n\nPhosphorus from organic residues (e.g., vinasse and filter cake) increased the organic \n\nlabile P pool in sugarcane fields (see Lat_23S, Table 1). In these conditions, similarly to \n\npasture, the supply of P in forms available to plants depends on mineralization of organic P; \n\nnevertheless, lower soil biological activity in sugarcane fields (FRANCO, 2015) may result in \n\nlower turnover of soil organic P, and consequently, an insufficient P supply for the sugarcane \n\ncrop. The release of P from crop residues is significantly reduced in systems where the P-\n\nstatus of crops and soils is low, requiring strong integration between organically cycled P with \n\nfertilizer management strategies (DAMON et al., 2014). Therefore, we suggest that \n\nfertilization strategies include a balance between organic and mineral P sources to improve \n\nboth sugarcane yield and soil quality. \n\nThe geochemical and biological P pools represented around 75 and 25% of the total P \n\nstock, respectively. These proportions were similar to values reported in the literature \n\n(NEUFELDT et al., 2000; NZIGUHEBA; B\u00dcNEMANN, 2005; PAVINATO; MERLIN; \n\nROSOLEM, 2009; SHEN et al., 2011; RODRIGUES et al., 2016). However, when only labile \n\nand moderately labile pools are considered, biological P represents more than 50% of total P, \n\nindicating a great importance of SOM-cycling to P plant-availability in both natural \n\necosystems and agroecosystems. Soil organic matter is often the major storehouse of soil P, \n\naccounting for 30 to 65% of total P (SHEN et al., 2011). In highly weathered tropical soils the \n\npools of organic P and decomposition of SOM are critical for plant productivity (CROSS; \n\nSCHLESINGER, 1995), and the maintenance of P in organic forms is the key for a long-term \n\nfunctioning and productivity of these soils (FONTE et al., 2014; NESPER et al., 2015; \n\nRODRIGUES et al., 2016), since the biological P pool is less susceptible to sorption reactions \n\n\n\n 73 \n\n(CROSS; SCHLESINGER, 1995). Future researches using techniques such as \n31\n\nP NMR are \n\nnecessary to identify organic P forms (see NASH et al., 2014, STUTTER et al., 2015 and \n\nKRUSE et al., 2015) and their effects on P-cycling and P plant-availability in areas \n\nundergoing LUC for expansion of biofuel crops. \n\n \n\n3.4.2 Implications of macrofauna on P cycling  \n\n \n\nOverall, biological P pool showed lower correlations with soil chemical properties and \n\nclay content than the geochemical P pool (Table 2), indicating that soil biological properties \n\nand processes (e.g., macrofauna, symbiotic actions between soil microorganisms and plants; \n\nactions of enzymes released by plant roots and microorganisms) and soil physical and \n\nstructural conditions (FONTE et al., 2014; NESPER et al., 2015) should be considered to \n\nunderstand the dynamic of the biological P pool in the soil. This assumption was confirmed, \n\nsince positive relationship was found between soil macrofauna diversity and biological P pool \n\n(Figure 5). The disconnection between total P contents and biological variables can be \n\nexplained by the fact that the geochemical P pool (especially non-labile P forms) comprised \n\naround 75% of the total P at all the field sites (Figure 3). \n\nIn this study, higher densities of macrofauna animals were specially related to the \n\nwide dominance of termites in the communities of pasture soils at Lat_17S and Lat_23S \n\n(FRANCO, 2015). It was clearly the cause of the negative relationships between macrofauna \n\ndensity and the all the others biological variables. In accordance with our findings, studies \n\nhave shown that functional diversity of the soil macrofaunal community affects \n\ndecomposition processes and nutrient cycling (HEEMSBERGEN et al., 2004; ZIMMER; \n\nKAUTZ; TOPP, 2005; COLLISON; RIUTTA; SLADE, 2013). Heemsbergen et al. (2004) \n\nobserved that functional dissimilarities between soil macrofauna species, irrespectively of the \n\nnumber of taxonomic groups, is a driver of ecosystem processes related to nutrient cycling \n\ndue to facilitative interactions among species. Zimmer, Kautz and Topp (2005) reported a \n\npotential effect on ecosystem functioning through joint action of soil macrofauna even at low \n\nspecies diversity. It suggests that the taxa richness was associated with the enrichment of P \n\nlabile forms as an indirect result of the positive correlation between functional diversity and \n\ntaxa richness found in this study (Figure 5). We suggest that correlation between high soil P \n\navailability and the presence of a functional diverse soil macrofaunal community may be \n\nlinked to a rapid turnover of an increased organic P content. \n\n\n\n 74 \n\nSome studies have described a significant enrichment of labile P forms as a result of \n\nthe activity of macrofaunal groups such as coleoptera (LI et al., 2006), earthworms \n\n(OUEDRAOGO et al., 2005) and termites (R\u00dcCKAMP et al., 2010). Li et al. (2006) showed \n\nan increased availability of soil P during the gut passage of scarabaeid beetle (Coleoptera) \n\nattributed to solubilization and enzymatic hydrolysis of organic P, and desorption of inorganic \n\nP. The contribution of earthworms to enhance soil P availability is attributed to higher pH of \n\nthe gut content, changes in sorption complexes due to the competition for sorbing sites \n\nbetween phosphate and carboxyl groups of a mucus glycoprotein produced in its gut, and an \n\nincrease in microbial activity during digestion (CHAPUIS-LARDY et al., 2011). Termites \n\ncontribute to high levels of soil labile P by the transformation of organic P through enzymatic \n\nactivity in the fresh biostructures (CHAPUIS-LARDY et al., 2011).  \n\nThe LUC associated to sugarcane expansion in Brazil causes negative effects in both \n\nSOC (FRANCO et al., 2015) and soil biodiversity (FRANCO, 2015), which potentially \n\naggravates the low plant availability of phosphorus in highly weathered soils, the main costly \n\nand limiting factor for agricultural productivity in tropical soils. Monitoring soil macrofaunal \n\nbiodiversity to control functional simplification of the community may therefore be an \n\nefficient management strategy in sugarcane fields for increased soil P availability and likely \n\nfor multiple ecosystem services. \n\n \n\n3.4.3 Phosphorus pools as soil quality indicators  \n\n \n\nPhosphorus is an integral component to ecosystem management because it limits \n\nprimary production in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems (ELSER et al., 2007; \u00c5GREN;  \n\nWETTERSTEDT; BILLBERGER, 2012; ELSER, 2012). Phosphorus is one of the primary \n\nlimiting nutrients for agricultural production in Brazilian soils due to both inherent \n\ncharacteristics to strongly weathered soils and inadequate strategies of P application \n\n(NOVAIS; SMYTH; NUNES, 2007). Hence, P pools are highly influential on key soil \n\nfunctions related to nutrient fluxes and ecosystems services responsible for maintaining a \n\nsuitable soil biotic habitat and sustaining plant growth (DORAN; PARKIN, 1994; LAVELLE \n\net al., 2014). Soil quality indicators are defined as those soil properties and processes having \n\nthe greatest sensitivity to changes in soil functions (ANDREWS; KARLEN; \n\nCAMBARDELLA, 2004). Therefore, for the soils we evaluated soil P pools appear to be \n\nuseful soil quality indicators. \n\n\n\n 75 \n\nOur findings showed modifications of P pools in response to LUC associated with \n\nsugarcane expansion. Strong correlations among P pools and other soil properties broadly \n\nused to assess soil degradation, such as SOC, CEC and acidity attributes (DORAN; PARKIN, \n\n1994; KARLEN et al., 2013), endorse the sensitivity of P pools to changes in soil functions. \n\nFurthermore, we observed significant correlations between taxonomic richness and diversity, \n\nand functional diversity of soil macrofauna communities with biological and labile P pools. \n\nSoil macrofauna have been indicated as an efficient biological indicators of modifications on \n\nsoil quality as response to management or land-use changes (DORAN; ZEISS, 2000; \n\nROUSSEAU et al., 2013; LAVELLE et al., 2014). Therefore, P pools warrant further \n\ninvestigations as potential soil quality/health indicators able to assess and monitor the soil \n\ndegradation associated to sugarcane expansion for ethanol production in Brazil.  \n\nIn addition, future studies should be carried out using an integrated approach to \n\nunderstand collectively the LUC effects on isolated indicators, for instance SOC stocks \n\n(MELLO et al., 2014; FRANCO et al., 2015), soil nutrients (CHERUBIN et al., 2015; \n\nFRANCO et al., 2015), soil biodiversity, soil structure and physical quality and others, to \n\ndetermine the environmental sustainability of Brazilian ethanol. \n\n \n\n3.5 Conclusions \n\n \n\nThis field study carried out across the primary sugarcane producing region in Brazil \n\nindicated that long-term conversions from native vegetation (Cerrado and Atlantic forest \n\nbiome) to extensive pasture induced significant depletions of soil total P stocks. These results \n\nshowed a critical process of soil chemical degradation, which helps to explain the low \n\nproductivity in most of Brazilian pasturelands. Our findings suggest that under degraded \n\npasture, the biological P pool plays crucial role for supplying available P to plants. \n\nThe LUC from pasture to sugarcane altered the P-cycle, increasing P stocks in \n\nmoderately labile and non-labile pools. The fertilization management recovered total P stocks \n\nof sugarcane soils to similar or higher levels than those measured in natural ecosystems. \n\nHowever, although high accumulation rates of P were found, only a small and insufficient \n\namount was kept in available forms to plants. Phosphorus inputs from organic residues (e.g., \n\nfilter cake and vinasse) increased the organic labile P and may be a complementary strategy to \n\nsupply P for sugarcane crop. \n\nPhosphorus pools were significantly correlated with soil chemical attributes. Also, \n\nfunctional diversity of soil macrofauna community was positively related with increases of \n\n\n\n 76 \n\nsoil P availability to plants, probably as a response to biological P pool increase and its greater \n\nturnover in the soil. Therefore, we conclude that P pools are useful indicators for detecting \n\nsoil quality/health changes induced by LUC associated to sugarcane expansion in Brazilian \n\ntropical soils.  \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\n\u00c5GREN, G.I.; WETTERSTEDT, J.\u00c5.M.; BILLBERGER, M.F.K.

In Brazil, sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) expansion to produce \n\nethanol is displacing degraded pastures. Intensive mechanization for sugarcane production, \n\ncould impact soil physical quality in these areas. We evaluated a typical LUC sequence (i.e., \n\nnative vegetation \u2013 pasture \u2013 sugarcane) on soil physical quality at three sites in central-\n\nsouthern Brazil. The attributes evaluated through on-farm and laboratory soil analyses were: \n\nbulk density, degree of compactness, macroporosity, microporosity and total porosity, water-\n\nfilled pore space, indexes of soil water storage and aeration capacity, soil resistance to \n\npenetration, field-saturated hydraulic conductivity and stability structural index. Calculations \n\nof mean weight diameter for the soil aggregates and visual evaluation of soil structure (VESS) \n\nscores were also included in this study. From those data we defined a minimum dataset for \n\ncalculating an additive soil physical quality index (SPQI). Long-term conversion from native \n\nvegetation to pasture increased soil compaction (i.e., higher bulk density, degree of \n\ncompactness and resistance to penetration values), decreased aeration porosity and water \n\nhydraulic conductivity, and consequently, created an unbalanced ratio between water- and air-\n\nfilled pore space in the soil. Based on our SPQI, the soil\u2019s capacity to perform its physical \n\nfunctions decreased from 90% under native vegetation to 73% under pasture. Land-use \n\nchange from pasture to sugarcane induced slight soil physical quality degradation, in which \n\nsoil function was 68 and 56% of capacity. Overall, soil physical quality decreased under \n\nsugarcane fields, due to decreases in soil porosity, aeration and water hydraulic conductivity \n\nas well as increases in soil penetration resistance, structural degradation and erosion risk. \n\nTillage operations performed during the sugarcane replanting had a short-term positive effect \n\non soil physical quality, although over time it further decreased the resistance to erosion and \n\nstructural degradation. Therefore, to convert degraded pasture to sugarcane in a sustainable \n\nmanner, the soils should be managed in ways that increase the soil organic matter and \n\nminimize compaction. These actions are needed to prevent further soil physical quality \n\ndegradation and to improve the sustainability of sugarcane ethanol production. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Land-use change; Soil compaction; Soil physical functions; Ethanol production \n\n \n\n4.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nIncreasing global demand for biofuel has promoted the intensification of LUC around \n\nthe world, imposing concerns about soil physical quality degradation and its negative \n\nimplications on ecosystem function (GASPARATOS; STROMBERG; TAKEUCHI, 2011; \n\nFU et al., 2015). Brazil is the largest sugarcane ethanol producer in the world, having \n\nincreased from 5.8 to 9.0 Mha between 2005 and 2015 (COMPANHIA NACIONAL DE \n\n\n\n 84 \n\nABASTECIMENTO, 2015). To meet projected (2021) domestic supplies for ethanol in \n\nBrazil, an additional 6.4 Mha of sugarcane is required (GOLDEMBERG et al., 2014). \n\nHistorically sugarcane expansion has been concentrated in central-southern Brazil, \n\nwith 70% of this expansion occurring in degraded pasturelands (ADAMI et al., 2012). The \n\ndevelopment of Brazilian agriculture has seen extensification of pasture into native vegetation \n\nwith poor management practices. This has resulted in loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) and \n\nsoil fertility (MELLO et al., 2014; CHERUBIN et al., 2015; FRANCO et al., 2015). It is \n\nestimated that 70% of Brazilian pasturelands are degraded or in the process of being degraded \n\n(DIAS-FILHO, 2014). The vast area of degraded pasture in Brazil, coupled with opportunities \n\nfor improvements in current ranching practices, could provide enough land for sugarcane \n\nproduction to meet the projected demand for ethanol, while still meeting the domestic demand \n\nfor other ecosystem services (LAPOLA et al., 2010; GOLDEMBERG et al., 2014). \n\nIn comparison to pasture, sugarcane production requires intensive mechanization \n\nresulting in changes to soil physical properties and related processes. Soil tillage is used to \n\nincorporate lime and fertilizer when sugarcane is first established, and again at approximately \n\nfive-year intervals when sugarcane yields begin to decrease and it is replanted. With the \n\nrecent shift to mechanized harvesting, intensive machinery traffic may be contributing to soil \n\nphysical degradation in these areas. Studies have shown increased soil bulk density and soil \n\nstrength (BAQUEIRO et al., 2012; BANGITA; RAO, 2012; SOUZA et al., 2014; 2015), with \n\ndecreases in soil porosity, aeration, aggregation, water infiltration and available water in many \n\nsugarcane fields (BRAUNACK; McGARRY, 2006; CASTRO et al., 2013; FRANCO, 2015; \n\nHUNKE et al., 2015b). \n\nSoil physical quality degradation has adverse impacts on root growth (OTTO et al., \n\n2011; BAQUEIRO et al., 2012; SOUZA et al., 2014; 2015), often limiting uptake of water \n\nand nutrients, thus decreasing sugarcane yields (BANGITA; RAO, 2012; SOUZA et al., \n\n2014). Decreased sugarcane productivity also decreases atmospheric CO2 uptake by above \n\nand belowground biomass, resulting in lower organic C inputs and a gradual depletion of SOC \n\n(FRANCO et al., 2015). Decreasing soil physical quality may also reduce ecosystem \n\nfunctioning (FU et al., 2015), by accelerating soil C turnover (SIX; ELLIOTT; PAUSTIAN, \n\n2000), decreasing SOC stocks (MELLO et al., 2014; FRANCO et al., 2015) and increasing \n\nCO2 emissions (BALL, 2013; SILVA-OLAYA et al., 2013). In terms of biogeochemical \n\nprocesses, soil compaction reduces air-filled porosity favoring denitrification (N2O emissions) \n\nand methanogenesis (CH4 emissions) (BALL, 2013). Runoff and soil erosion risks increase \n\nbecause physically degraded soils have lower water infiltration rates (HUNKE et al., 2015a,b) \n\n\n\n 85 \n\nand thus contribute sediment, nutrients, and pesticides to surface waters (GUCKER; \n\nBOECHAT; GIANI, 2009; HUNKE et al., 2015a,b). Furthermore, soil compaction can also \n\nmodify or destroy native biological habitats, resulting in loss of biodiversity and ecosystem \n\nfunction (BENTON; VICKERY; WILSON, 2003). \n\nAlthough many technical papers have been published, LUC effects on soil physical \n\nquality associated with sugarcane expansion in Brazil are still poorly documented. We \n\nconducted an on-farm study in the largest sugarcane-producing regions of Brazil to: i) \n\nquantify effects of the primary LUC sequence associated with sugarcane expansion (i.e., \n\nnative vegetation to pasture to sugarcane) on soil physical properties, and ii) integrate the soil \n\nphysical indicators of soil degradation into an additive index for assessing LUC impacts on \n\nsoil physical functioning. We hypothesized that the LUC from native vegetation to pasture \n\nand then to sugarcane was resulting in continuous degradation of soil physical quality that \n\ncould be detected by computing an overall Soil Physical Quality Index (SPQI). \n\n \n\n4.2 Material and Methods \n\n \n\n4.2.1 Study sites and experimental design  \n\n \n\nThe study sites and experimental design were described in the 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 items. \n\n \n\n4.2.2 Sampling and soil physical measurements \n\n \n\nSoil sampling was carried out in January 2014. At each land use (i.e., native \n\nvegetation, pasture and sugarcane) soil samples were collected using a consistent grid pattern \n\ncomposed of nine sampling points spaced 50 m apart, providing a total of 27 sampling points \n\nfor each site (i.e., total of 81 sampling points for the three sites). At each sampling point, a \n\nsmall trench (30 x 30 x 30 cm) was opened to collect disturbed and undisturbed soil samples \n\nfrom the 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm layers, providing a total of 243 soil samples for soil \n\nphysical analyses. Although root systems of tropical pastures and sugarcane can reach deeper \n\nsoil layers, we limited our assessment to 30 cm because most of roots are concentrated in this \n\nlayer (BALL-COELHO et al., 1992; KANNO et al., 1999) and this is the zone where more \n\nsignificant soil physical property changes are induced by land use and management practices. \n\nThe sampling points for each land use were positioned in representative locations within the \n\ntotal area sampled. In native vegetation areas we avoided sampling close to ant or termite \n\n\n\n 86 \n\nnests, burrows of wild animals and big trees. In pasture areas, which were continuously and \n\nuniformly grazed, our major caution was to avoid sampling on the preferential cattle \n\ntrampling paths, where the soil is much more compacted. Except at Lat_17S where the soil \n\nhad been recently tilled for sugarcane replanting, all sampling points in sugarcane fields were \n\nlocated within the inter-row position, which is homogeneously tracked during harvest \n\noperations.  \n\nMeasurements of soil resistance to penetration (SRP) were taken around the soil \n\nsampling trenches to a depth of 30 cm using a digital penetrometer (PenetroLOG\n\u00ae\n). Five \n\nreplicates were used to compute an average value for each sampling point. Field-saturated \n\nhydraulic conductivity (Kfs) was measured using the \u2018simplified falling-head\u2019 method \n\nproposed by Bagarello, Iovino and Elrick (2004) and later used by Keller et al. (2012). Three \n\nreplicate Kfs measurements for each sampling point were made using steel cylinders (height \n\n15 cm x internal diameter 15 cm), inserted 8 cm into the soil and 330 ml of water applied \n\naccording to Keller et al. (2012).  \n\nIn the laboratory, disturbed soil samples were used to determine particle size using the \n\nhydrometer method (GEE; OR, 2002). The undisturbed soil samples were weighed (initial soil \n\nwater content), saturated for 48 h by gradually raising the water level in a tray and weighed \n\nagain. Soil water content at -6 kPa and -10 kPa water potentials were determined using \n\ntension tables similar to those described by Ball and Hunter (1988). The soil samples were \n\nthen dried at 105\no\nC for 48 hours and weighed again. Bulk density (BD, Mg m\n\n-3\n) was \n\ncalculated by dividing the soil dry mass by volume of the cylinder. The maximum bulk \n\ndensity (BDmax, Mg m\n-3\n\n) was estimated using a pedotransfer function described by Marcolin \n\nand Klein (2011), in which SOM and clay content are the input parameters. Based on the BD \n\nand BDmax the soil degree of compactness (SDC, %) was calculated [SDC = (BD/BDmax) x \n\n100]. Soil particle density (PD, Mg m\n-3\n\n) was determined from sub-samples (5g) using a gas \n\npycnometer according to Flint and Flint (2002). The total porosity (TP, m\n3\n m\n\n-3\n) was \n\ncalculated as TP = 1 - (BD/PD). Soil macroporosity (MaP, m\n3\n m\n\n-3\n) was computed as the \n\ndifference between soil water content at saturation and at -6 kPa. Soil microporosity (MiP, m\n3\n \n\nm\n-3\n\n) was estimated as the soil water content at the -6 kPa. Water-filled pore space (WFPS) \n\nwas calculated by dividing volumetric moisture at -6 kPa by TP as described by Wienhold et \n\nal. (2009). In addition, we calculated two indexes according to Reynolds et al. (2002): i) the \n\nsoil water storage capacity (SWSC) defined as the ratio between water content at field \n\ncapacity (FC, -10 kPa soil water potential) and TP (SWSC = FC/TP); ii) soil aeration capacity \n\n\n\n 87 \n\n(SAC) calculated as the ratio between drained pores at soil water potential of -10 kPa (ACt) \n\nand TP (SAC = ACt/TP).  \n\nThe risk of soil structural degradation was assessed using the \u201cstructural stability \n\nindex\u201d (SSI), according to Reynolds et al. (2009): SSI = [(SOC x 1.724) / (silt + clay)]*100, \n\nwhere, SOC is the organic carbon content (g kg\n-1\n\n); 1.724 is a factor to convert SOC to SOM; \n\nsilt and clay are particle size fractions (g kg\n-1\n\n). \n\nMean weight diameter of soil aggregates (MWD) and VESS scores were used to \n\nverify the correlation with other soil physical properties and calculate an index of SPQ. The \n\nMWD and VESS data were taken from Franco (2015) and Cherubin et al. (2016)\n2\n, \n\nrespectively, which were measured from soil samples collected at the same sites and sampling \n\ntimes.  \n\n \n\n4.2.3 Soil Physical Quality Index calculation \n\n \n\nAn overall soil physical quality index (SPQI) was calculated to quantify LUC effects \n\nassociated with sugarcane expansion in Brazil. Development of the SPQI followed three steps \n\nas outlined by Karlen and Stott (1994) and Karlen, Ditzler and Andrews (2003). The first step \n\nwas to select appropriate SPQ indicators to represent and monitor four critical soil physical \n\nfunctions. They were to: f(i): support root growth; f(ii): supply water for plants and edaphic \n\nfauna; f(iii): allow gas exchange between soil and atmosphere (soil aeration); and f(iv): ability \n\nto resist erosion and soil degradation. These functions are essential to sustain plant \n\nproductivity and maintain ecosystem services.  \n\nBased on published literature and the authors\u2019 experience, eight indicators (BD, VESS \n\nscore, SWSC, Kfs, MaP, SAC, MWD and SSI) were used as a minimum dataset to determine \n\nhow well the four critical soil physical functions were being performed under the three land \n\nuses. The second step (indicator interpretation) involved transforming each indicator into a \n\nunitless value ranging from 0 to 1 for inclusion in the SPQI. The soil data from 0-10, 10-20 \n\nand 20-30 cm were averaged to 0-30 cm layer to calculate an overall soil physical quality \n\nindex that better represents the whole soil profile assessed. The transformation was performed \n\nusing a linear technique as described by Andrews, Karlen and Mitchell (2002). Indicators \n\nwere ranked in ascending or descending order depending on whether a higher value was \n\nconsidered \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d in terms of soil function. For \u2018more is better\u2019 indicators, such as \n\n                                                 \n\n2\n Data presented in the chapter 5. \n\n\n\n 88 \n\nMaP, Kfs MWD and SSI, each observation was divided by the highest observed value such \n\nthat the highest observed value received a score of 1. For \u2018less is better\u2019 indicators, such as \n\nBD and VESS, the lowest observed value (in the numerator) was divided by each observation \n\n(in the denominator) such that the lowest observed value receives a score of 1. For \u2018optimum\u2019 \n\nindicators, such as SWSC and SAC observations were scored as \u2018higher is better\u2019 up to a \n\nthreshold value (SWSC = 0.66 and SAC = 0.33) then scored as \u2018lower is better\u2019 above the \n\nthreshold.  \n\nFor step 3, the transformed indicator values were multiplied by their weight. These \n\nresults were summed within each soil physical function, resulting in a scored soil physical \n\nfunction. Subsequently, the individual scores of soil physical function were multiplied by \n\ntheir weight. Finally, these weighed scores were summed to calculate the SPQI. In Table 1 the \n\nstep by step procedure used for developing the SPQI is shown. Soil physical function scores \n\nand SPQI scores for each sample were averaged and standard deviations were calculated for \n\neach land use. In addition, two scenarios were compared to verify soil physical quality effects \n\nof tillage operations performed during the sugarcane replanting. \n\n \n\nTable 1 - Model of the soil physical functions framework and indicators used for developing \n\nthe soil physical quality index (SPQI) \n\nSoil \n\nphysical \nfunction\n\n\u2021\n \n\nWeight \nSoil \n\nindicator\n\u00a7\n Weight \n\nTransformed \n\nindicator value\n\u2020\n \n\nSoil \n\nindicator \n\nscore \n\nSoil physical \nfunction score \n\nWeighted soil \n\nphysical \n\nfunction score \n\nSPQI \n\n?(II x III) \n\nI II III  (II x III) IV (IV x I) ?(IV x I) \n\nf(i)  \n0.25 \n\nBD 0.50 0.79 0.40 \n0.72 0.18 \n\n0.68 \n\n  VESS 0.50 0.65 0.33 \n\nf(ii)  \n0.25 \n\nSWSC 0.50 0.89 0.45 \n0.84 0.21 \n\n  Kfs 0.50 0.78 0.39 \n\nf(iii)  \n0.25 \n\nSAC 0.50 0.39 0.20 \n0.59 0.15 \n\n  MaP 0.50 0.78 0.39 \n\nf(iv)  \n0.25 \n\nMWD 0.50 0.54 0.27 \n0.59 0.15 \n\n  SSI 0.50 0.64 0.32 \n\u2021\nf(i): support roots growth; f(ii): supply water for plants and edaphic fauna; f(iii): allow gases exchange between soil and atmosphere (soil \n\naeration); and f(iv): ability resist erosion and physical degradation; \n\u00a7\nBD: bulk density, VESS: visual evaluation of soil structure, SWSC: soil \n\nwater storage capacity index, Kfs: field-saturated hydraulic conductivity, SAC: soil aeration capacity index, MaP: macroporosity, MWD: \nmean weight diameter of soil aggregates, SSI: structural stability index; \n\n\u2020\nIndicator values obtained by linear transformation of the measured \n\nvalues (second step of index calculation). \n\n \n\n4.2.4 Data analyses \n\n \n\nData were tested for normality using Shapiro-Wilk\u2019s tests (p>0.05), indicating that \n\ndata transformation was not required.

In addition, \n\na Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis (p<0.01 and p<0.05) was performed using PROC CORR \n\n\n\n 89 \n\nprocedure among soil physical attributes and SOC. The scores calculated for each soil \n\nphysical function and the SPQI were compared using Tukey\u2019s test (p<0.05). All statistical \n\nanalyses were carried out using the Statistical Analysis System \u2013 SAS v.9.3 (SAS Inc., Cary, \n\nUSA). \n\n \n\n4.3 Results \n\n \n\n4.3.1 Bulk density (BD) and soil degree of compactness (SDC)  \n\n \n\nConversion from native vegetation to pasture increased BD in all soil layers at all sites \n\n(Figure 1). Bulk density within the 0-30 cm layer was 23%, 19% and 28% lower in native \n\nvegetation compared to pasture at Lat_17S, Lat_21S and Lat_23S, respectively. Conversion \n\nfrom pasture to sugarcane had no significant effect on BD except for the sugarcane field at \n\nLat_17S which was undergoing replanting (tillage operations) when soils were sampled. \n\nTillage reduced BD in the surface layer (0-10 cm), but overall, BD tended to increase below \n\n10 cm for all sites and land uses.  \n\nLand-use change had a significant effect on the SDC (Figure 1), showing an \n\nincreasing transition from native vegetation to pasture of 14%, 19% and 23% at the Lat_17S, \n\nLat_21S and Lat_23S, respectively. Conversion from pasture to sugarcane had no significant \n\neffect on SDC, except in the upper layer (0-10 cm) of the sugarcane field undergoing \n\nreplanting (Lat_17S), where it was lower. Overall, SDC values ranged from 67 to 79% ( ? \n\n73%) under native vegetation, 84 to 98% ( ? 90%) under pasture and 74 to 100% ( ? 90%) for \n\nsugarcane soils. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 90 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1 - Bulk density and soil degree of compactness from 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm layers \n\nunder native vegetation (NV), pasture (PA) and sugarcane (SC) at Lat_17S, \n\nLat_21S and Lat_23S in central-southern Brazil. *Mean values within each site in same \ndepth followed by the same letter do not differ among themselves according to Tukey\u2019s test \n\n(p<0.05).

At the Lat_17S site, MaP and MiP \n\nwithin the 0-10 cm layer were not significantly different under sugarcane compared to native \n\nvegetation. Overall, water-filled pore space (WFPS) increased significantly due to our LUC \n\nsequence (Figure 2K-M). At Lat_17S and Lat_23S the highest WFPS values (~0.6) were \n\nfound in sugarcane soils. At Lat_23S, WFPS values reached approximately 0.85 in pasture \n\nand sugarcane soils.  \n\n \n\n4.3.3 Soil water storage capacity (SWSC) and soil aeration capacity (SAC) \n\n \n\nOverall, LUC induced significant changes in SAC and SWSC (Figure 3). At Lat_17S, \n\nconversion from native vegetation to pasture had no significant impacts on SAC, with values \n\nof approximately 0.5. Significant reductions on SAC were verified in deeper layers (10-20 \n\nand 20-30 cm) in sugarcane, with values reaching 0.3 (Figure 3A). At Lat_21S and Lat_23S \n\nLUC effects on SAC (Figure 3B, C) were more significant, with higher values in soils under \n\nnative vegetation averaging 0.57 and 0.43. Conversion from native vegetation to pasture \n\ndecreased SAC to average values of 0.31 and 0.08, indicating reductions of 45% and 81%, \n\nrespectively. Establishment of sugarcane under pasture, in general, had no significant \n\ninfluence on SAC. \n\nTransition from native vegetation to pasture significantly increased SWSC at Lat_21S \n\nand Lat_23S reaching average values of 0.69 and 0.92 in pasture, respectively. Under \n\nsugarcane at Lat_17S, significant increases in SWSC were observed in deeper layers when \n\ncompared to native vegetation and pasture, with values of 0.72 for the 10-20 cm layer and \n\n0.69 for the 20-30 cm layer (Figure 3A). At Lat_21S and Lat_23S there was no clear trend in \n\nupper soil layers (i.e., pasture had higher SWSC than sugarcane soils at one site, but a lower \n\nvalue at the other site).

Overall, increased SOC resulted in a \n\nreduction in BD, SAC, SDC and Kfs and an increase in TP, MiP, MaP, WFPS, SWSC, MWD \n\nand SSI.  \n\n \n\n4.3.8 Soil physical quality assessement \n\n \n\nMinimum dataset indicator scores for the two scenarios analyzed are shown in Figure \n\n7. Conversion from native vegetation to pasture promoted severe reductions in Kfs and MaP \n\nscores and moderate reductions in VESS, BD and SSI scores. In contrast, pasture soils had the \n\nhighest SAC, SWSC and MWD scores. For scenario I (Figure 7A), which did not include the \n\nsugarcane field that was being replanted, there was a major decrease in indicator scores, while \n\nfor scenario II (Figure 7B) which included all sugarcane fields, tillage associated with \n\nreplanting in one of three fields resulted in a marked increase in the Kfs score. Furthermore, \n\nsmall improvements in MaP, SAC and VESS scores were also verified. On the other hand, \n\ntillage reduced MWD and SSI scores. \n\nThe overall scores for each soil physical function and SPQI are presented in Table 3. \n\nFor f(i) related to supporting root growth, a significant reduction in scores was observed in the \n\nsequence native vegetation > pasture > sugarcane. Under pasture this function decreased 24% \n\n(0.76) compared to maximum performance (1.00) under native vegetation. Tillage operations \n\ncarried out during sugarcane replanting promoted significant improvement in f(i), increasing \n\nthe score from 0.68 to 0.72 score, although, this was not enough to offset impacts of \n\nconversion from pasture to sugarcane. For f(ii) related to water supply for plants and edaphic \n\nfauna, conversion from native vegetation to pasture and then to sugarcane without tillage \n\n(SCwr) decreased scores markedly (from 0.84 to 0.55 and 0.43). However, the tillage \n\noperation in sugarcane increased water entry into the soil and resulted in scores (0.83) similar \n\nto those found in native vegetation. The f(iii) related to soil aeration was affected similarly to \n\nf(i), in which the scores decreased in the sequence native vegetation > pasture > sugarcane. \n\n\n\n 99 \n\nTillage improved soil aeration compared to sugarcane without tillage (SCwr) as indicated by \n\nscores of 0.44 and 0.59. For f(iv) related to ability for resist against erosion and soil \n\ndegradation, the results point out that under native vegetation and pasture there was no \n\ndifference (0.93 and 0.94). On the other hand, within sugarcane fields, lower scores were \n\nfound (0.59 in sugarcane and 0.68 in sugarcane without tillage). Beyond that, the f(iv) scores \n\nindicated that the sugarcane field being replanted, had a poor ability to resist erosion and \n\nsubsequent degradation.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7 - Overall scores of the soil minimum dataset indicators for the 0-30 cm layer in the \n\nland-use change areas in central-southern Brazil, where A) scenario I: native \n\nvegetation (NV), pasture (PA) and sugarcane without replanting tillage (SCwr) \n\nwhen sampled; and B) scenario II: NV, PA and sugarcane including a field with \n\nreplanting tillage (SC) \n \n\n \n\nOverall, the additive SPQI was effective in classifying land uses according to the \n\nhypothesized potential of soil degradation in response to land-use intensification (Table 3). \n\nTherefore, conversion from native vegetation to pasture and then to sugarcane led to a \n\nreduction of SPQI. Finally, the SPQI was sensitive enough to identify that soil tillage \n\noperations had been carried out in the replanted sugarcane field, thus confirming its general \n\nability to improve a soil\u2019s capacity to perform its physical functions, even though it had short-\n\nterm effects. \n\n \n\n \n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\nBD\n\nVESS\n\nSWSC\n\nKfs\n\nMaP\n\nSAC\n\nMWD\n\nSSI\n\nNV PA SCwr\n\nA \n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\nBD\n\nVESS\n\nSWSC\n\nKfs\n\nMaP\n\nSAC\n\nMWD\n\nSSI\n\nNV PA SC\n\nB \n\n\n\n 100 \n\nTable 3 - Overall scores for each soil physical function and Soil Physical Quality Index \n\n(SPQI) values, within the 0-30 cm layer in the native vegetation (NV), pasture \n\n(PA) and sugarcane with replanting tillage (SC) and without replanting tillage \n\n(SCwr) in central-southern Brazil \n\nLand use \nSoil physical functions\n\n\u00a7\n \n\nSPQI \nf(i) f(ii) f(iii) f(iv) \n\nNV 1.00 a\n*\n 0.84 a 0.83 a 0.93 a 0.90 a \n\nPA 0.76 b 0.55 b 0.67 b 0.94 a 0.73 b \n\nSC 0.72 c 0.83 a 0.59 c 0.59 c 0.68 c \n\nSCwr 0.68 d 0.43 c 0.44 d 0.68 b 0.56 d \n\u00a7 \n\nf(i): support roots growth; f(ii): supply water for plants and edaphic fauna; f(iii): allow gases exchange between \n\nsoil and atmosphere (soil aeration); and f(iv): ability to resist erosion and physical degradation; \n*\nMean values \n\nwithin each soil function followed by the same letter do not differ among themselves according to Tukey\u2019s test \n\n(p<0.05). \n\n \n\n4.4 Discussion \n\n \n\n4.4.1 Impacts of the LUC from native vegetation to pasture on soil physical attributes  \n\n \n\nLong-term conversion (>30 years) from native vegetation to extensive pasture led to \n\nsignificant soil compaction (Figure 1). Sampled pastures had BD values that were >1.2 Mg m\n-\n\n3\n in clay soils and >1.6 Mg m\n\n-3\n in sandy soils, suggesting a limiting condition for optimum \n\nplant growth on tropical soils (REICHERT; REINERT; BRAIDA, 2003; REICHERT et al. \n\n2009). The SDC provides a more robust evaluation of soil compaction, because optimum BD \n\nand porosity values for crop growth vary considerably among soils (i.e., BD is strongly \n\ndependent on mineral composition and SOC). Optimal SDC had been associated with values \n\nbetween 80 and 90% (REICHERT et al., 2009). Our results suggest that soil compaction was \n\nclose to the upper limit and even limiting grass growth, especially in high clay soils at \n\nLat_23S, where the SDC averaged 96% for the 0-30 cm layer. Soil compaction in pastures is \n\nprimarily caused by SOC depletion and cattle trampling. Recently, Franco et al. (2015) \n\nverified that SOC losses, induced by conversion of native vegetation to pasture, resulted in an \n\naverage C emission rate of 0.4 Mg ha\n-1\n\n yr\n-1\n\n in these sampled sites. Several studies have \n\nreported the crucial role that SOM plays with regard to resisting structural degradation in \n\npastures (e.g., FONTE at al., 2014; NESPER et al., 2015). Low C inputs also have adverse \n\nimplications on nutrient cycling and biological activity, further decreasing pasture \n\nproductivity and increasing soil degradation. In addition, compressive forces due to \n\ncontinuous cattle trampling can induce soil compaction that has negative effects on soil \n\n\n\n 101 \n\nphysical quality and plant growth in pastures (GREENWOOD; McKENZIE, 2001; \n\nPIETOLA; HORN; YLI-HALLA, 2005; HERBIN et al., 2011; COSTA et al., 2012). \n\nIn this study, increased soil compaction reduced soil aeration and resulted in strong \n\nnegative correlations between BD, SDC, and soil aeration properties (Table 2). Macroporosity \n\nand the SAC index were severely affected by conversion from native vegetation to pasture, \n\nwith MaP values (Figure 2) falling below the critical limit of 10% (XU; NIEBER; GUPTA, \n\n1992) and SAC values falling below 0.33 (Figure 3), which has been suggested as an ideal \n\nratio for good soil aeration. These results are consistent with several other studies (e.g., \n\nHERBIN et al., 2011; RESENDE et al., 2012). In contrast, average values for MiP, WFPS \n\nand SWSC in pasture soils were higher than for native vegetation soils (Figures 2 and 3). \n\nWithin the most compacted soils (Lat_23S), WFPS values exceeded 0.7 indicating excess \n\nwater and reduced soil aeration, which can induce denitrification (WIENHOLD et al., 2009). \n\nFurthermore, the SWSC reached 0.92 which is much higher than the 0.66 value that is \n\nconsidered ideal for good balance between air and water content in the soil (REYNOLDS et \n\nal., 2002; 2009). Although the pasture soils have greater SWSC than native vegetation soils, it \n\ndoes not mean that this water is easily accessible to roots. Soil compaction decreases the size \n\nand continuity of pores increasing water retention at lower soil water potentials and \n\ndecreasing overall soil water availability. \n\nSurface soil compaction also leads to reduced Kfs (REICHERT et al., 2009; HUNKE \n\net al., 2015b). Our results showed Kfs reductions ranging from 76 to 98% in pasture soil \n\ncompared to native vegetation (Figure 4). These cause and effect relationships were \n\nconfirmed by inverse correlations between Kfs versus BD and SDC and positive correlations \n\nbetween Kfs versus TP and MaP (Table 2); a response similar to that found by Reichert et al. \n\n(2009). Several studies showing reduction in water infiltration and Kfs from LUC effects in \n\nBrazilian Cerrado were compiled by Hunke et al. (2015a). In recent field-study Hunke et al. \n\n(2015b) found that conversion from native vegetation to pasture significantly reduced \n\ninfiltration rates (-96%) and Kfs (-92%), indicating high susceptibility to surface erosion and \n\nan increased potential for lateral nutrient transport to the surface waters, as reported by \n\nGucker, Boechat and Giani (2009). Reductions of Kfs were also consistently documented from \n\ntrampling effects on grazing pasture (e.g., GREENWOOD; McKENZIE, 2001) even under \n\nlow-intensity grazing (PIETOLA; HORN; YLI-HALLA, 2005). Higher soil mechanical \n\nresistance to root growth in pasture (Figure 5) is a key-factor limiting water access to the \n\nplants. We found SRP values >2 MPa (suggested as a critical limit to root growth) in all \n\npasture sites. Geissen et al. (2009) concluded that permanent pasture in Mexico led to higher \n\n\n\n 102 \n\nSRP and soil compaction. Costa et al. (2012) also found that an increased SRP associated with \n\nhigh-intensity grazing promoted lower root growth of Panicum maximum.  \n\n \n\n4.4.2 Impacts of the LUC from pasture to sugarcane on soil physical attributes  \n\n \n\nConversion from long-term extensive pasture to sugarcane induced slight soil physical \n\ndegradation. Sugarcane cultivation resulted in SOC losses (FRANCO et al., 2015) and relies \n\non heavy mechanization (SOUZA et al., 2014; 2015), but significant differences in soil \n\ncompaction (Figures 1 and 5), as evidenced by porosity (Figure 2), SAC and SWSC (Figure \n\n3) and Kfs (Figure 4), were not observed when compared to pasture areas. Other studies also \n\nfound no differences in BD and TP (RESENDE et al., 2012) or Kfs (HUNKE et al., 2015b) \n\nbetween long-term extensive pasture and sugarcane fields in Brazilian Cerrado, even though, \n\nboth land uses had lower soil physical quality than areas with native vegetation.  \n\nAlthough soil physical degradation due to conversion from pasture to sugarcane was \n\nless intense than from native vegetation to pasture, soil physical conditions under sugarcane \n\nmay be limiting plant growth. Soil compaction indicators (BD and SDC) were higher than \n\nestablished critical limits and the SRP values were >2 MPa, suggesting poor root growth \n\n(OTTO et al., 2011; SOUZA et al., 2014). Soil compaction in sugarcane fields due to \n\nintensive machine traffic is well documented in the literature (BRAUNACK; McGARRY, \n\n2006; BAQUEIRO et al., 2012; CASTRO et al., 2013; SOUZA et al., 2014; 2015). \n\nCompressive forces are applied to soil by tractors, trailers and harvesters, causing a reduction \n\nin pore space and an increase in soil strength. Consequently, soil aeration properties were \n\nsignificantly affected, as shown by MaP&lt;10% and SAC&lt;0.33, which suggests a \n\ndiscontinuity in pathways of air-filled pores for gas diffusion (XU; NIEBER; GUPTA, 1992). \n\nThe WFPS values were close 0.6 (Lat_17S and Lat_21S) or >0.7 (Lat_23S), indicating \n\nlimiting soil aeration which can induce greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. \n\nSoils within the sampled sugarcane fields showed a high risk for degradation since SSI \n\nvalues were generally ?5%. Lower soil structural resilience results in decreases in \n\nmacroaggregation and MWD, lower Kfs, and poor VESS scores, and it suggests that areas \n\nunder sugarcane expansion are at increased risk for runoff and soil erosion, both which may \n\nhave adverse effects on soil and water quality.  \n\nTillage performed during conversion of pasture to sugarcane and carried out during \n\nsugarcane replanting may be pointed out as the key-factor for alleviating soil compaction and \n\nmaintaining soil physical conditions in a slightly better or similar condition in sugarcane \n\n\n\n 103 \n\nfields as under pasture. The effects of soil tillage during sugarcane replanting were verified at \n\nLat_17S, especially in the top layer (0-10 cm). Measurements showed a decrease in SDC \n\n(Figure 1) and SRP (Figure 5A) and an increase in MaP (Figure 2A), total porosity (Figure \n\n2G), SAC (Figure 3A) and Kfs (Figure 4A). Tillage operations promote soil disturbance, \n\ncreate large pores and consequently alleviate soil compaction, improving soil physical \n\nconditions for sugarcane root growth. Unfortunately, soil physical remediation was restricted \n\nto the top soil layer, indicating that these mechanical operations were not successful in \n\nrestoring the entire soil profile. Understanding the real impact of tillage is important for \n\nfarmers, because the operations are expensive (CHAMEN et al., 2015) and when inadequately \n\ncarried out could have adverse consequences on sugarcane yield.  \n\nOur findings also suggest that tillage performed for sugarcane replanting had a short-\n\nterm effect on soil physical properties. This agreed with study by Centurion et al. (2007) who \n\nverified better soil physical conditions just after tillage followed by progressive soil physical \n\ndegradation from the first to fourth ratoon. Short-term tillage improvements in soil physical \n\nquality may be associated with the disruption of macroaggregates (SIX; ELLIOTT; \n\nPAUSTIAN, 2000; FRANCO, 2015) which also favors more intense SOC losses (SILVA-\n\nOLAYA et al., 2013) and further structural degradation of the soil (Figure 6). This soil \n\nstructural degradation is magnified by successive compaction events associated with \n\nmachinery traffic, and leads to greater soil compaction throughout the sugarcane cycle \n\n(BRAUNACK; McGARRY, 2006; BAQUEIRO et al., 2012). \n\n \n\n4.4.3 Sugarcane expansion versus soil physical quality \n\n \n\nThe minimum dataset used to assess soil physical quality (0-30 cm layer) was able to \n\nrank LUC effects according to soil physical degradation (Figure 7; Table 3). Overall, the \n\nhighest index for soil physical functioning was verified for soils under native vegetation, \n\nsuggesting that they were functioning at 90% of their potential capacity. The soil physical \n\nfunction scores showed that under native vegetation the soil has full capacity to support root \n\ngrowth, since higher C inputs combined with the absence of soil perturbation ensures \n\nstructural arrangement providing good soil physical conditions for growth and deep \n\npenetration of roots. The large air-filled porosity observed under native vegetation provides \n\nadequate soil aeration, but the reduced soil water retention induces an unbalanced ratio \n\nbetween air and water in the soil. Therefore, scores of f(ii) and f(iii) were not maximum (0.84 \n\nand 0.83) in these soils. Finally, higher SOM contents under native vegetation areas favor \n\n\n\n 104 \n\nformation of large aggregates and provide greater soil structural stability. Those inherent \n\ncharacteristics also suggest that soils beneath native vegetation have the ability to resist \n\nerosion and physical degradation.  \n\nConversion from native vegetation to pasture promoted significant decreases in the \n\nsoil\u2019s capacity to perform its physical functions (SPQI = 0.73). The extensive low-input \n\nmanagement commonly used in pastures for more than 30 years led to soil compaction and \n\nreduced the soil\u2019s capacity to support of root growth - f(i), to supply water for plants and \n\nedaphic fauna - f(ii) and to allow gases exchange between soil and atmosphere - f (iii) \n\ncompared to native vegetation soils. Despite that, based on our minimum dataset, we verified \n\nthat pasture soils had high capacity to resist erosion and physical degradation. These results \n\nmay be linked to greater macrofauna activity in pasture areas as suggested by Lavelle et al. \n\n(2014) and the aggressive root system of Poaceae (i.e., Brachiaria and Cynodon) which plays \n\ncrucial role in soil aggregation and improvement of soil structural quality, especially in the \n\ntop few centimeters (FONTE et al., 2014). \n\nSugarcane expansion into long-term extensive pasture land led to slightly negative \n\nchanges in soil physical quality over time. Our findings showed that management practices \n\nadopted in sugarcane fields result in more dynamic changes in soil physical properties. This \n\nwas illustrated by the one sugarcane field where recent tillage operations resulted in an overall \n\nsoil capacity to perform physical functions of 68%, which was close to that observed in \n\npasture (73%). Mechanical tillage alleviated soil compaction resulting in better aeration, water \n\navailability and favorable conditions for root growth. However, intensive sugarcane \n\nmanagement using big and heavy machines promotes soil compaction over time. Our results \n\nindicated that soils in the fourth and fifth ratoon of sugarcane are functioning at only 56% of \n\ntheir potential. The measurements also suggest that sugarcane expansion into degraded \n\npastures should follow management strategies that minimize soil physical degradation to \n\nensure long-term economic and environmental sustainability for this production system. \n\nOur findings confirmed an increasing risk for soil loss and degradation due to erosion \n\nin sugarcane fields that is aggravated by tillage operations during the sugarcane replanting. \n\nSoil perturbation increases structural degradation and SOC losses, decreasing the soil\u2019s \n\ncapacity to resist erosion. In addition, after tillage operations, uncovered soil remains for \n\nweeks or months, creating increased water and wind erosion risks. Throughout the sugarcane \n\nproduction cycle, the main driver to soil erosion is compaction, which has deleterious effects \n\non soil structure and water infiltration. Soil erosion is reported as one of major threats to \n\nsustainability of Brazilian sugarcane production system (MARTINELLI; FILOSO, 2007). In \n\n\n\n 105 \n\nthe state of S\u00e3o Paulo, which is the core of the ethanol industry in Brazil, estimated rates of \n\nsoil erosion in sugarcane fields are close to 60 Mg ha\n-1\n\n yr\n-1\n\n while in forests and pasture \n\nerosion rates do not exceed 2 Mg ha\n-1\n\n yr\n-1\n\n (WEILL; SPAROVEK, 2008). Thus, future \n\nresearch needs to evaluate the degree of soil erosion and associated soil and water resource \n\ndegradation due to LUC in Brazilian sugarcane belt. \n\nBased on our results, we emphasize the urgent need to adopt strategies to mitigate \n\nadverse effects of current sugarcane management practices on soil physical quality, \n\nminimizing the environmental impact of biofuel production. The season for sugarcane \n\nreplanting, which extends from September to March, coincides with the highest rainfall period \n\nin central-southern Brazil. Therefore, a crop rotation plan including commercial crops [e.g., \n\ncorn (Zea mays) or soybean (Glycine max)] or cover crops (e.g. Crotalaria juncea or Mucuna \n\naterrima) could be implemented to prevent soil degradation by erosion, improve C allocation \n\nthroughout the soil profile, N-fixation and nutrient cycling, break pest cycles and alleviate soil \n\ncompaction. Machinery entry on the field, especially during harvest operations should be \n\ndone under soil moisture conditions less favorable to compaction. Mathematical models that \n\ninclude soil and agricultural machinery characteristics should be developed as an auxiliary \n\nmanagement guide to predict the impact of the entry of machines on soil physical quality (for \n\nexample, see KELLER et al., 2015). In addition, more investments and research are necessary \n\nfor developing machines adapted for implementing controlled traffic in sugarcane production \n\nsystem and for studying sugarcane planting strategies with different inter-row spacing, \n\nkeeping non-trafficked zones between crop rows, as well as specific tillage zones, as \n\ndiscussed by Bangita and Rao (2012). \n\nFinally, we suggest that soil physical quality changes should be evaluated and \n\nmonitored throughout the sugarcane life cycle using indicators selected to calculate an overall \n\nSPQI, such as BD, VESS, MaP, SAC, Kfs, SWSC, MWD and SSI. If sufficient resources \n\n(time and money) are not available for a detailed soil assessment including all of these \n\nindicators, we suggest using the VESS, which is an on-farm, inexpensive, simple to perform \n\nand easy to understand approach for evaluating soil physical quality. VESS scores are well-\n\ncorrelated with soil physical properties, and thus provide a first approximation of overall soil \n\nstructure quality that can help farmers and land managers evaluate the impact of various \n\nmanagement practices on sugarcane production. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 106 \n\n4.5 Conclusions \n\n \n\nWe investigated soil physical quality impacts of LUC associated with sugarcane \n\nexpansion across the primary sugarcane-producing region in Brazil. Our hypotheses were \n\nconfirmed. Conversion from native vegetation to long-term, extensive pasture increased soil \n\ncompaction (i.e., higher values of BD, SDC and SRP), decreased aeration porosity and water \n\nhydraulic conductivity, and consequently, created an unbalanced ratio between water- and air-\n\nfilled pore space in the soil. Based on our SPQI the native vegetation and pasture soils are \n\nfunctioning at 90 and 73% of their potential capacity, respectively.  \n\n The LUC from pasture to sugarcane induced slight soil physical quality degradation \n\nand resulted in soils functioning at between 56 and 68% of their capacity. Overall, sugarcane \n\nfields have critical soil compaction (BD and SDC) that is decreasing soil pore space (TP), soil \n\naeration (MaP and SAC) and Kfs and increasing soil strength (SRP) and the risk for soil \n\nerosion and structural degradation. Tillage operations performed approximately every five \n\nyears when sugarcane is replanted have some short-term positive effects on soil physical \n\nquality; although overall it reduces the soil\u2019s ability to resist degradation due to erosive \n\nprocesses. Therefore, sugarcane expansion in Brazil should require the adoption and \n\nmonitoring of management strategies that increase SOM and minimize soil compaction to \n\nreduce soil physical quality degradation and thus improve sustainability of sugarcane \n\nproduction in Brazil.  \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\nADAMI, M.; RUDORFF, B.F.T.; FREITAS, R.M.; AGUIAR, D.A.; SUGAWARA, M.; \n\nMELLO, M.P.

The intensive mechanization associated with this LUC under tropical soils in Brazil \n\nhas increased concerns regarding structural quality. Through decades of research focused on \n\nidentifying sensitive indicators of soil degradation due to land use and management, the \n\nVisual Evaluation of Soil Structure (VESS) method has emerged as a simple, fast, reliable and \n\naccurate semi-quantitative approach for assessing soil structure changes. VESS integrates soil \n\nproperties related to size, strength and porosity of aggregates, and root characteristics into a \n\nsingle score (Sq - structural quality) that ranges from 1 (good structural quality) to 5 (poor \n\nstructural quality). Although the VESS method was developed for temperate soils, it has been \n\nused successfully as an indicator of soil and crop management practice effects on structural \n\nquality of tropical and subtropical soils. Our objectives were to evaluate soil structural quality \n\nchanges associated with a LUC sequence (i.e., native vegetation to pasture to sugarcane) at \n\nthree sites under Oxisols, Alfisols and Ultisols across central-southern Brazil using the VESS; \n\nand to correlate VESS scores with quantitative measurements of soil physical properties. \n\nAverage VESS scores were 2.0, 2.7, and 3.1 for native vegetation, pasture, and sugarcane, \n\nrespectively. Overall the VESS method was able to detect soil structural quality changes \n\nunder LUC for sugarcane cultivation, indicating a decrease in soil quality from native \n\nvegetation through pasture to sugarcane. The VESS scores were significantly correlated with \n\nquantitative soil physical property measurements, suggesting VESS is a reliable indicator of \n\nsoil structural quality in tropical soils. A VESS critical score (Sq= 3.0) seems to be suitable as \n\na guide for management decisions. We conclude that VESS scores provide an efficient \n\nmethod to identify impacts of sugarcane expansion on soil structural quality, and recommend \n\nthat VESS assessment be incorporated into monitoring protocols for evaluating not only \n\nsugarcane expansion areas, but also overall soil quality/health in Brazil. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Land-use change; Visual method; Soil physical properties \n\n \n\n5.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nThe large-scale cultivation of biofuel crops for bioenergy has caused widespread \n\ntransformations in land use worldwide, either directly or through the replacement of other \n\nmanaged lands with food crops (FOLEY et al., 2005). Brazil, the world\u2019s largest producer of \n\nsugarcane ethanol [29.2 billion of liters per year (COMPANHIA NACIONAL DE \n\nABASTECIMENTO, 2016)], is one of principal hotspots of these land-use changes \n\n(LAPOLA et al., 2014). In the last decade (2005-2015), the sugarcane area has increased from \n\n\n\n 114 \n\n5.8 to 9.0 Mha, with most of area being concentrated within the central-southern region \n\n(COMPANHIA NACIONAL DE ABASTECIMENTO, 2016). Nevertheless, in order to meet \n\nthe projected domestic Brazilian supplies for ethanol by 2021, an additional 6.4 Mha of \n\nsugarcane will be required (GOLDEMBERG et al., 2014). Historically, in central-southern \n\nBrazil the expansion of agriculture has been done through the removal of native vegetation \n\nand the introduction of pasture, but often using poor management practices (LAPOLA et al., \n\n2014), which has resulted in vast areas of low-productivity pasture (STRASSBURG et al., \n\n2014) and poor soil quality (CHERUBIN et al., 2015; FRANCO et al., 2015). Therefore, \n\nconversion of extensive pasturelands to sugarcane is the most opportune and widespread land-\n\nuse change to meet projected ethanol demands, thus avoiding direct competition for land with \n\nfood crops and natural ecosystems (GOLDEMBERG et al., 2014; STRASSBURG et al., \n\n2014).   \n\nConversion of pastureland to sugarcane production requires intensive mechanization \n\nthrough large and heavy agricultural machines that impose unavoidable modifications to soil \n\nstructure and to soil physical properties. Recent studies have shown that the LUC from \n\npasture to sugarcane depletes soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks (MELLO et al., 2014; \n\nFRANCO et al., 2015) and increases soil susceptibility to compaction due to heavy and \n\nintense traffic during mechanical harvest and transport (BRAUNACK; McGARRY, 2006; \n\nLOZANO et al., 2013; SOUZA et al., 2014). Therefore, soil compaction has been identified \n\nas the main concern in modern sugarcane production systems in Brazil (LOZANO et al., \n\n2013; SOUZA et al., 2014) and has been characterized by increases in bulk density, leading to \n\na reduction in macroporosity and water infiltration (BRAUNACK; McGARRY, 2006; \n\nCASTRO et al., 2013; SOUZA et al., 2014). Furthermore, these physically and structurally \n\ndegraded soils decrease root growth and sugarcane yield (OTTO et al., 2011; BAQUERO et \n\nal., 2012; SOUZA et al., 2014). \n\nImpacts of sugarcane production on soil physical and structural quality have been \n\ntraditionally assessed using quantitative soil physical properties such as bulk density, soil \n\nporosity, soil resistance to penetration, aggregate stability and macroaggregation that are \n\nindirectly related to soil structure (OTTO et al., 2011; LOZANO et al., 2013; SOUZA et al., \n\n2014). However, measurements of these soil properties are relatively time consuming and \n\nexpensive to analyze, and each sample provides an indication of the structural condition only \n\nat the point where it was taken within the soil profile (NEWELL-PRICE et al., 2013). \n\nAlternatively, visual methods of assessment of soil structure are characterized as simple, \n\ninexpensive, reliable and accurate, easy to perform, capable of producing results quickly and \n\n\n\n 115 \n\nbeing easily understood by researchers, advisers and farmers (BALL et al., 2007; \n\nGUIMAR\u00c3ES et al., 2011; ASKARI; CUI; HOLDEN, 2013; GIAROLA et al., 2013; \n\nMONCADA et al., 2014). To make the assessment of soil physical quality simpler, spade \n\nmethods based on the assessment of topsoil (first 25 cm) have been widely developed. This \n\nincludes the \u201cVisual Soil Assessment\u201d (VSA) method developed by Shepherd (2009) and the \n\n\u2018\u2018Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure\u2019\u2019 (VESS) method described by Ball, Batey and \n\nMunkholm (2007) and improved by Guimar\u00e3es, Ball and Tormena (2011).  \n\n The VESS method was developed from the Peerlkamp method (BALL; BATEY;  \n\nMUNKHOLM, 2007) and has been recognized as one of the simplest methods to employ \n\nwhile still including a variety of soil structure and rooting assessments (GUIMAR\u00c3ES et al., \n\n2013) in a way that Ball, Munkholm and Batey (2013) concluded can evaluate more than soil \n\nstructural quality. The VESS method involves taking an undisturbed soil sample, breaking it \n\nup and visually assessing the size, shape, porosity and strength of aggregates, presence and \n\nstate of roots and soil color (BALL; BATEY;  MUNKHOLM, 2007; GUIMAR\u00c3ES; BALL; \n\nTORMENA, 2011). These soil characteristics are integrated into a single numeric score (Sq - \n\nstructural quality) that ranges from 1 (good structural quality) to 5 (poor structural quality) \n\nthat can subsequently be submitted to statistical analysis for decision making (MUNKHOLM; \n\nHECK; DEEN, 2013). Another distinctive feature of VESS is its ability to distinguish \n\nbetween topsoil layers width different structural characteristics. It is important, because \n\nevaluating soil layers individually rather than giving only a weighted average score enables to \n\nimprove the choice of management practices adopted to preserve or improve overall structural \n\nsoil quality (GIAROLA et al., 2010; GUIMAR\u00c3ES; BALL; TORMENA, 2011; \n\nGUIMAR\u00c3ES et al., 2013). \n\nIn recent years, VESS has been used to evaluate soil structure and soil quality under \n\ndifferent land use and soil management (e.g., IMHOFF et al., 2009; GIAROLA et al., 2010; \n\n2013; ASKARI et al., 2013; GUIMAR\u00c3ES et al., 2013; MUELLER et al., 2013; \n\nMUNKHOLM; HECK; DEEN, 2013; CUI; ASKARI; HOLDEN, 2014; MONCADA et al., \n\n2014; ABDOLLAHI et al., 2015). However, we are not aware of any studies using VESS for \n\nevaluating soil structure changes induced by sugarcane expansion in Brazilian tropical soils. \n\nTherefore, our objective was to apply the VESS method for assessing soil structural quality \n\nchanges associated with a LUC sequence (i.e., native vegetation to pasture to sugarcane) at \n\nthree field-sites across central-southern Brazil. We tested the hypotheses that i) the VESS \n\nmethod is able to efficiently detect soil structure changes induced by LUC and is a suitable \n\nindicator of soil quality in areas under sugarcane expansion in Brazil; ii) VESS Sq score is \n\n\n\n 116 \n\nnegatively affected by LUC from native vegetation to pasture to sugarcane and, iii) VESS Sq \n\nscore is correlated with quantitative soil physical properties.  \n\n \n\n5.2 Material and Methods \n\n \n\n5.2.1 Study sites and experimental design  \n\n \n\nThe study sites and experimental design were described in the 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 items. \n\n \n\n5.2.2 Sampling and VESS measurements \n\n \n\nSoil sampling was carried out in January 2014. At each land-use site were collected \n\nfour samples (i.e., totaling 36 soil samples). Sampling points were positioned in representative \n\nlocations within each land use sampled. In native vegetation areas we avoided sampling close \n\nto ant or termite nests, burrows of wild animals and big trees. In pasture areas, which were \n\ncontinuously and uniformly grazed, our major caution was to avoid sampling on the \n\npreferential cattle trampling paths, where the soil is much more compacted. Except at Lat_17S \n\nwhere the soil had been recently tilled for sugarcane replanting, all sampling points in \n\nsugarcane fields were located within the inter-row position, which is homogeneously tracked \n\nduring harvest operations. \n\nThe VESS assessment and signature of scores were completed as described by \n\nGuimar\u00e3es, Ball and Tormena (2011). At each sampling core, a mini-trench (30 x 30 x 30 cm \n\nin size) was dug out and then, using a spade, an undisturbed sample (20 x 10 x 25 cm deep \u2013 \n\n5000 cm\n3\n volume) was collected and transferred to a plastic tray. The soil evaluation included \n\nmanual breakdown of soil aggregates along its fracture lines, identification of layers of \n\ncontrasting structure, measurement of layer depth and assignment of a score by comparing the \n\nstructure of the sample with the VESS chart, which contains descriptions and pictures of each \n\nproposed soil structure quality. The parameters used to describe soil structure included size, \n\nvisible porosity, color, shape and strength of aggregates as well as the presence, number and \n\ndistribution of roots (GUIMAR\u00c3ES; BALL; TORMENA, 2011).  \n\nSince distinct layers were identified and a score was assigned for each layer identified \n\naccording to the standard chart description, a final weighted score for each soil sample was \n\ncalculated using equation 1. \n\n \n\n\n\n 117 \n\n         ?\n      \n\n  \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n(1) \n\nwhere, VESSSq is the overall VESS score, Sqi and Di are respectively the score and depth of \n\neach identified soil layer, and TD is the total depth of soil sample.   \n\n \n\nTwo additional strategies of scoring were also used: first, a weighted average of the Sq \n\nscore was taken for the top (0-10 cm) and bottom (10-25 cm) soil layers at each site, and \n\nsecond, an overall Sq was taken using the depth and Sq scores of the naturally formed first \n\nand second soil layers. \n\nThe interpretation of VESS scores was conducted according to Ball, Batey and \n\nMunkholm (2007), which is based on requirements to change management practices to \n\npreserve soil structural quality: Sq=1 and Sq=2, good soil structural quality, requiring no \n\nchanges in management practices; Sq=3, adequate soil structural quality; however there is \n\nneed for improved soil management to avoid a further decline in soil quality. Therefore, Sq=3 \n\nis suggested as a critical limit to suitable crop production; Sq=4 and Sq=5, indicate poor soil \n\nstructural quality, requiring urgent remedial management practices.  \n\n \n\n5.2.3 Relationship among VESS scores and quantitative soil physical properties \n\n \n\nVESS is not a soil physical property but rather, it is a semi-quantitative measurement \n\nof soil structure. Thus, the VESS Sq score should be related to quantitative soil physical \n\nproperties routinely used for studying soil structure in the laboratory and the field. At the \n\nsame sampling time of the VESS assessments, soil resistance to penetration (SRP) \n\nmeasurements were taken and undisturbed soil samples (100 cm\n3\n) were collected. In the \n\nlaboratory the following soil physical properties were determined: bulk density (BD) \n\ncalculated by the ratio between soil dry mass and core volume; macroporosity (MaP) was \n\ncomputed as the difference between soil water content at saturation and soil water content at -\n\n6 kPa soil water potential; soil water storage capacity (SWSC) index, obtained as the ratio \n\nbetween water content at field capacity (-10 kPa soil water potential) and total porosity. These \n\nsoil physical properties were used only for establishing functional relationships with VESS Sq \n\n\n\n 118 \n\nscores. A detailed description of the methods used in these measurements were provided by \n\nCherubin et al. (2016)\n3\n. \n\n \n\n5.2.4 Data analyses \n\n \n\nThe raw data were submitted to descriptive analysis and their normality was tested \n\nusing a Shapiro-Wilk\u2019s test (p>0.05) through the Statistical Analysis System \u2013 SAS v.9.3 \n\n(SAS Inc., Cary, USA) software. Average values were compared using the confidence \n\ninterval (p<0.05) according to Gabriel (1978). To test local effects of LUC, average VESS \n\nscores were compared within each site and to test overall LUC effects (regional scale) the \n\naverage VESS scores of three sites were compared together. Linear regressions were \n\nperformed using PROC REG procedure in SAS to verify the relationship among VESS scores \n\nand quantitative soil physical properties.  \n\n \n\n5.3 Results and Discussion \n\n \n\n5.3.1 VESS sensitivity to detect LUC effects on soil structural quality \n\n \n\nThe VESS method was capable of assessing soil structural quality changes under a \n\nwide textural range (15-66% clay content) in the Brazilian tropical soils studied. The VESS \n\nassessment took about 20 to 25 minutes from digging out the mini-trench to assigning the \n\nfinal score. It was more difficult to extract and breakdown samples from sugarcane soils \n\nindicating signs of soil compaction and damaged soil structure. It is also important to collect \n\nsamples when soil moisture is close to field capacity, in order to minimize the physical effort \n\nassociated with digging the mini-trench, extracting, and manipulating the samples as \n\npreviously reported by Imhoff et al. (2009), Giarola et al. (2013) and Moncada et al. (2014). \n\nThe step-by-step recommendations, pictures and criteria for Sq score differentiation available \n\non the VESS chart properly enabled the identification of soil layers with different soil \n\nstructural conditions. The shape of aggregate (approx. 1.5 cm diameter) was an important \n\ncriterion for distinguishing between two scores when visual differentiation was not clear, \n\nespecially for Sq scores between 3 and 4. We stress that user knowledge and experience are \n\nvery important for assigning the Sq scores accurately. The visual evaluations were performed \n\n                                                 \n\n3\nData presented in the chapter 4. \n\n\n\n 119 \n\nby the same person in order to avoid potential Sq variability induced by different operators. \n\nDespite these limitations, several studies have shown that VESS scores have good \n\nreproducibility and that assessments can be accurately made by different, trained operators \n\n(BALL; BATEY;  MUNKHOLM, 2007; CUI; ASKARI; HOLDEN, 2014).  \n\nThe overall VESS scores ranged from 1.3 (native vegetation) and 4.0 (sugarcane), \n\nindicating a variation from good to poor soil structural quality among land uses (Table 1). \n\nMean and median values had small differences and coefficient of variation values were below \n\n25%. The normality of data was confirmed by Shapiro-Wilk\u2019s test (p>0.05).  \n\n \n\nTable 1 - Descriptive statistic of overall VESS scores for 0-25 cm layer in the native \n\nvegetation, pasture and sugarcane at three sites in central-southern Brazil \n\nLand use \n\nStatistical parameters\n(1)\n\n \n\nValues \nSD \n\nCoefficients W \ntest\n\n(2)\n Min Mean Median Max CV Cs Ck \n\n------------------------------------ Lat_17S ------------------------------------ \n\nNative Vegetation 1.30 1.81 1.83 2.28 0.43 23.53 -0.19 -1.46 0.99\nns\n\n \n\nPasture 1.61 2.00 2.01 2.36 0.31 15.35 -0.24  1.51 0.95\nns\n\n \n\nSugarcane 1.80 2.49 2.65 2.85 0.47 18.84 -1.71  3.14 0.82\nns\n\n \n\n------------------------------------ Lat_21S ------------------------------------ \n\nNative Vegetation 1.52 1.80 1.81 2.08 0.23 13.02 -0.06 0.05 0.99\nns\n\n \n\nPasture 2.46 2.91 3.00 3.18 0.32 11.01 -1.33 1.50 0.89\nns\n\n \n\nSugarcane 3.39 3.66 3.63 4.00 0.26   6.97   0.71 1.08 0.97\nns\n\n \n\n------------------------------------ Lat_23S ------------------------------------ \n\nNative Vegetation 1.74 2.52 2.68 3.00 0.56 22.29 -1.26   1.13 0.90\nns\n\n \n\nPasture 2.92 3.19 3.15 3.40 0.23   7.33   0.06 -4.54 0.90\nns\n\n \n\nSugarcane 2.87 3.26 3.08 4.00 0.51 15.66  1.71   3.02 0.82\nns\n\n \n(1)\n\n SD: standard deviation; CV (%): coefficient of variation; Cs: coefficient of skewness; Ck: coefficient of \n\nkurtosis; \n(2)\n\n W test: Shapiro-Wilk\u2019s test for normal distribution, where: (ns) non-significant by p<0.05, indicating \n\nthat the hypothesis of data are normally distributed was not rejected.  \n\n \n\nThe VESS method was sensitive to local and regional soil structure changes induced \n\nby LUC for sugarcane production (Figures 1 and 2). Overall, conversion from native \n\nvegetation to pasture and then to sugarcane decreased soil structural quality for all soil layers \n\n(Figure 1). When the three sites were analyzed together (regional scale), overall VESS Sq \n\nscores significantly increased from Sq= 2.0 in native vegetation to Sq= 2.7 in pasture and then \n\nto Sq= 3.1 in sugarcane fields (Figure 2). We also identified a significant increase in scores \n\nfrom the top layer (0-10 cm depth) to the bottom layer (10-25 cm depth) for both local (Figure \n\n1) and regional scale (Figure 2), indicating an increasing level of degradation in deeper layers. \n\nGuimar\u00e3es et al. (2013) reasoned that assigning scores to individual layers provides \n\n\n\n 120 \n\ninformation that is more detailed and, therefore, allows more accurate management decision \n\nmaking than when only using a weighted average as described by Ball, Batey and Munkholm \n\n(2007). Using this approach, users can identify specific layers for sampling in case additional \n\nsamples for quantitative analysis of soil quality indicators are desired (GUIMAR\u00c3ES et al., \n\n2013).  \n\nConsidering the critical VESS score Sq= 3.0, as suggested by Ball, Batey and \n\nMunkholm (2007), it was verified that native vegetation soils, regardless of soil layer, have \n\ngreater structural quality (Sq&lt;3.0), supporting a suitable environment for root system growth \n\nand the exploitation of deeper soil layers. For pasture and sugarcane soils, poorer structural \n\nquality (Sq >3.0) was identified, mainly in the bottom layer (10-25 cm) at Lat_21S and \n\nLat_23S, suggesting that management practice changes are needed to alleviate soil \n\ncompaction. Our regional scale VESS assessment showed an overall score (Sq = 3.1) that was \n\nvery close to the critical limit (Sq= 3.0) but it was even worse (i.e., Sq= 3.5) when the \n\nLat_17S site was not considered because it had been tilled for sugarcane replanting just before \n\nthe time of sampling. These results confirm that current soil and crop management practices \n\nbeing used for sugarcane production are fostering a dangerous decline in soil structural quality \n\nand its consequent deleterious effects on sugarcane growth, development, and productivity. \n\nThese results are supported by several other studies that show that current management \n\npractices can lead to soil compaction, which negatively affects sugarcane root system \n\ndevelopment and consequently, reduced yields (BRAUNACK; McGARRY, 2006; OTTO et \n\nal., 2011; BAQUERO et al., 2012; SOUZA et al., 2014). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 121 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1 - VESS scores (Sq) for the top (0-10 cm) and bottom (10-25 cm) layers and overall \n\nSq for total layer (0-25 cm) at Lat_17S (A; B), Lat_21S (C; D) and Lat_23S (E; F) \n\nunder land-use change sequence (native vegetation \u2013 pasture \u2013 sugarcane).

The greater inputs of soil organic matter \n\n(SOM) and higher biological activity associated with absence of soil tillage and management \n\nare key factors for maintaining a deeper layer ( ? 10.4 cm) of better soil structural quality ( ? \n\nSq= 1.2) under native vegetation (Figure 4). Recently, Franco et al. (2015) verified that native \n\nvegetation had higher SOC stocks (0-30 cm layer) compared to pasture (average -26%) and \n\nsugarcane (average -36%) soils at these same sampling sites. In addition, field observations \n\nduring VESS assessments indicated a high presence of earthworm burrows and evenness of \n\nroot distribution in native vegetation soils. Organic carbon inputs associated with soil biota \n\nand root activity act as cementing agents throughout the soil aggregation process, gradually \n\nresulting in the formation of organic-mineral complexes (primary particles) that slowly form \n\nmicro- and then macroaggregates (TISDALL; OADES, 1982).

This \n\nincrease in C turnover time enables the organization of more complex and stable soil structure \n\nunder native vegetation areas (SIX et al., 1998). Furthermore, the absence of tillage avoids \n\ndisruption of aggregates and exposure of occlude SOM, that can ultimately lead to SOM \n\ndecomposition.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 - Illustration of the soil structural changes detected by VESS method due to effects of \n\nland-use change (e.g., native vegetation Sq = 1.5; pasture Sq = 2.5; sugarcane Sq = \n\n4.0) in central-southern Brazil \n\n \n\nLong-term conversion from native vegetation to extensive pasture induced soil \n\nstructure alterations in the sampled soil profile. We found a thinner layer ( ? 6.8 cm) of good \n\nsoil structural quality ( ? Sq= 1.2) only associated with the rhizosphere zone (Figure 4) \n\noverlying a compacted and deeper soil layer. The vigorous root systems of tropical grasses \n\n(e.g., the Brachiaria and Cynodon genera) can increase aggregate stability and improve soil \n\nstructural quality (VEZZANI; MIELNICZUK, 2011; FONTE et al., 2012). Large root \n\nLand-Use Change \n\nNative Vegetation Pasture Sugarcane \n\n\n\n 125 \n\nsystems promote high C inputs and act on the formation and stabilization of soil structure. \n\nGreater C stock in superficial soil layer was confirmed by Franco et al. (2015), who reported \n\naverage SOC stock decreases of 6% from 0-10 to10-20 cm layer and 18% from 0-10 to 20-30 \n\ncm layer in these pasture sites. Roots release a variety of exudates that have a cementing \n\neffect on soil particles and they can physically influence microaggregate formation via the \n\ncompressing action of growing roots and in the entanglement of soil particles to form and \n\nstabilize macroaggregates (TISDALL; OADES, 1982; SIX et al., 2004; BRONICK; LAL, \n\n2005). Roots also increase wet-dry cycling of adjacent soil, alter the ionic and osmotic \n\nbalance in the rhizosphere through nutrient uptake and rhizodeposition and host a large \n\npopulation of micro- and macroorganisms that contribute to SOC and soil aggregation \n\n(TISDALL; OADES, 1982; SIX et al., 2004; BRONICK; LAL, 2005). In contrast, continuous \n\ncattle trampling and inadequate pasture management are the major drivers for soil compaction \n\nin pasturelands (NEWELL-PRICE et al., 2013; CUI; ASKARI; HOLDEN, 2014). Soil \n\ncompaction limits growth and depth penetration of roots, decreasing deeper allocation of SOC \n\nand its potential improvement on soil structural quality. It results in a deeper bottom soil layer \n\n( ? 18.2 cm) of poor structural quality ( ? Sq= 3.3).  \n\nIn sugarcane fields, a smaller soil surface layer depth ( ? 5.1 cm) with good structural \n\nquality ( ? Sq= 2.0) and consequently larger bottom layer depth ( ? 19.9 cm) of poor soil \n\nstructural quality ( ? Sq= 3.6) can be associated with soil tillage operations performed during \n\nthe establishment (land-use conversion) and replanting of sugarcane, SOC losses and \n\nintensive machinery traffic under favorable conditions for soil compaction. A thinner soil \n\nlayer with good soil structural quality (lower Sq score) implies a reduced soil volume \n\nexploited by the sugarcane root system (OTTO et al., 2011; SOUZA et al., 2014). Under \n\nweather condition in central-southern Brazil, especially during dry periods, more fragile and \n\nsuperficial root systems induce chemical and physical stress to the plants that can lead to a \n\ndecline in yield and the need for premature replanting operations. The soil tillage operations \n\nprovide an intensive soil disturbance, inducing SOC losses to the atmosphere (SILVA-\n\nOLAYA et al., 2013; MELLO et al., 2014). In addition, sugarcane reformation is very \n\nexpensive and requires appropriate weather to be carried out in an agronomically successful \n\nmanner. Therefore, soil structural degradation decreases both environmental and economic \n\nsustainability of sugarcane production. The thicker surface layer of good soil structure \n\nobserved in sugarcane fields (Figures 3 and 4) may be related to the positive effects of \n\nmaintaining sugarcane straw on the soil surface. These results are supported by Franco et al. \n\n(2015), who reported reduction of SOC in deeper layers in these same sugarcane sites. \n\n\n\n 126 \n\nDalchiavon et al. (2013) also verified that maintenance of sugarcane straw on the soil surface \n\nincreases SOC stocks, decreases bulk density and soil resistance to penetration, and improves \n\nsugarcane yield.  \n\nDespite the differences between soils and length of sugarcane cultivation, a \n\ncomparison of sugarcane fields at the different study sites (Figure 5) indicated that VESS Sq \n\nscores increased from sugarcane replanting (Lat_17A) through initial growth (Lat_23S) to full \n\ngrowth (Lat_21S). Tillage operations conducted during planting or replanting (plowing and \n\ndisking) promote soil disturbance and consequently alleviate soil compaction. Therefore, just \n\nafter those operations VESS scores are lower, indicating better soil structural quality and \n\nadequate soil physical conditions for sugarcane growth. However, our data suggest that tillage \n\nperformed for sugarcane replanting had a short-term effect on soil structure. Soil tillage \n\noperations promote disruption of macroaggregates favoring SOC losses (SIX et al., 1998; \n\n2004) and inducing an increase in soil compaction over time (CASTRO et al., 2013). Its \n\ndeleterious effects are further magnified by successive machinery operations used during the \n\nsugarcane production season (LOZANO et al., 2013; SOUZA et al., 2014).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5 - Evolution of VESS scores during the sugarcane\u2019s annual life cycle, where, \n\nLat_17S: sugarcane replanting; Lat_23S: initial growth; Lat_21S: full growth.

Additional studies for evaluating impacts of sugarcane \n\nmanagement on soil structure assessed by VESS should be carried out through the whole \n\nsugarcane cycle (about five years). Furthermore, subsoil compaction in sugarcane fields \n\nshould also be evaluated using methodology such as SubVESS, proposed by Ball et al. \n\n(2015). We consider subsoil compaction an important concern since sugarcane roots have the \n\npotential to explore soil layers much deeper than 25 cm. Both VESS and SubVESS could be \n\nimplemented at the same time for a complete evaluation of structural quality throughout the \n\nentire soil profile.  \n\nThe VESS scores (Sq >3.0) found in this study suggest that important management \n\nchanges are required to mitigate the negative effects of sugarcane cultivation on soil structure \n\nand improve its sustainability. Adoption of minimum tillage, harvesting without prior burning \n\nand maintaining straw on the soil surface could increase SOC and improve soil structure, \n\nmaking the soil more resistant to compressive machinery effects. Protocols that aim to have \n\nmachinery enter fields under soil moisture that are less favorable to compaction in \n\nconjunction with controlled traffic strategies should also be encouraged to keep soil structure \n\nfavorable for sustainable sugarcane production.  \n\n \n\n5.3.2 VESS score as an integrative soil structural quality indicator \n\n \n\nQuantitative soil physical properties traditionally used to assess soil structure changes \n\nin sugarcane fields have been used for supporting management decisions. Since the VESS \n\nmethod integrates several soil physical properties into a single score, it is convenient that \n\nVESS scores are correlated with these quantitative parameters. Figure 6 shows that VESS Sq \n\nscores have a significant relationship with bulk density (r\n2\n = 0.33 to 0.56), macroporosity (r\n\n2\n = \n\n0.23 to 0.44), index of soil water storage capacity (r\n2\n = 0.21 to 0.50), and soil resistance to \n\npenetration (r\n2\n = 0.32 to 0.52), regardless of the inherent properties of the soil (e.g., soil \n\ntexture, moisture and SOC).  \n\n\n\n 128 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6 - Relationship of the VESS scores with bulk density, macroporosity, soil water \n\nstorage capacity and soil resistance to penetration (SRP) at Lat_17S (left), Lat_21S \n\n(center) and Lat_23S (right).

Overall, the critical VESS score (Sq= 3.0) used \n\nto guide management changes was satisfactorily convergent with critical values to: bulk \n\ndensity, 1.2, 1.4 to 1.6 Mg m\n-3\n\n for clay, medium texture and sandy soils, respectively \n\n(REYNOLDS et al., 2002); macroporosity, 0.1 m\n3 \n\nm\n-3\n\n (XU; NIEBER; GUPTA, 1992); soil \n\nwater storage capacity, 0.66 (REYNOLDS et al., 2002) and soil resistance to penetration, 2 \n\nMPa (OTTO et al., 2011). VESS critical score (Sq= 3.0) proposed by Ball, Batey and \n\nMulkholm (2007) for temperate soils seems appropriate as a guide for management decision \n\nin tropical soils.  \n\nThese results suggest that VESS is an accurate and reliable semi-quantitative method \n\nthat integrates physical functions (e.g., water availability, aeration and root growth) related to \n\nstructural and physical quality of soils. Thus, VESS could be used as an alternative or \n\ncomplementary tool for assessing sugarcane expansion impacts on soil structural quality in \n\nBrazilian tropical soils. These results are consistent with Guimar\u00e3es et al. (2013), who showed \n\nthat VESS and the Least Limiting Water Range (a complex indicator) have converged to \n\nidentify soil physical conditions highly restrictive to plant growth when Sq >3.5. In addition, \n\nquantitative soil physical properties have site-specific responses (Figure 6), which are highly \n\ninfluenced by inherent soil characteristics, and therefore, become one of the drawbacks of \n\nusing one of these properties alone as an indicator of soil for structure or soil quality \n\n(NEWELL-PRICE et al., 2013). \n\nIn addition to the ability of VESS to detect soil structure/physical changes, as reported \n\nin this study, Mueller et al. (2013) reported that visual methods for soil assessment are useful \n\ndiagnostic tools for monitoring and controlling overall soil quality over different scales, \n\nranging from within-field to global. Recent studies confirmed that VESS can be used to \n\nvalidate quantitative soil quality indexes that encompassed soil chemical, physical and \n\nbiological properties (ASKARI; HOLDEN, 2014; 2015). Therefore, the VESS method should \n\nbe suggested to sugarcane producers as a practical, easily-performed and accurate tool for \n\nmonitoring soil quality degradation. This also helps to reduce cost and time when evaluating \n\nsoil quality over large sugarcane areas, typical in central-southern Brazil. A future challenge \n\nis the automated collection of samples to quantify VESS. This is needed to broaden its use, \n\nespecially in extensive areas cultivated with sugarcane in Brazil. Finally, development of \n\nprotocols and training of technicians and consultants on the proper application of VESS are \n\n\n\n 130 \n\nessential steps for its effective use in the assessment and monitoring of soil quality within \n\nsugarcane production systems.  \n\n \n\n5.4 Conclusions \n\n \n\nThe VESS method was efficiently sensitive for detecting soil structural quality \n\nchanges, demonstrating its potential for direct on-farm assessment. VESS scores were \n\nsignificantly correlated with quantitative soil physical properties, and the VESS critical score \n\n(Sq= 3.0) is a reliable guide for management decisions in Brazilian tropical soil under \n\nsugarcane cultivation. Land-use conversions from native vegetation to pasture and then to \n\nsugarcane led to degradation of soil structural quality. Therefore, sugarcane expansion fields \n\nmust be monitored to prevent soil physical limitations that can negatively affect growth and \n\nyield of sugarcane. We conclude that VESS scores provide an efficient method for identifying \n\nsoil structural quality degradation induced by LUC, and recommend that VESS evaluations be \n\nincorporated into monitoring protocols for evaluating soil quality/health in areas of sugarcane \n\nexpansion in Brazil. \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\nABDOLLAHI, L.; HANSEN, E.M.; RICKSON, R.J.; MUNKHOLM, L.J.

We hypothesized that SMAF would be sensitive \n\nenough to detect SQ changes associated to sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) expansion for \n\nethanol production. Field studies were carried out at three sites across the central-southern \n\nregion of Brazil, aiming to quantify impacts of a land-use change sequence (i.e., native \n\nvegetation \u2013 pasture \u2013 sugarcane) on SQ. Eight soil indicators were individually scored using \n\nSMAF curves developed primarily for North American soils and integrated into an overall \n\nSoil Quality Index (SQI) and in its chemical, physical and biological sectors. The SMAF \n\nscores were correlated with two other approaches used to assess SQ changes, soil organic \n\ncarbon (SOC) stocks and Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure (VESS) scores. Our findings \n\nshowed that the SMAF was an efficient tool for assessing land-use change effects on SQ of \n\nBrazilian tropical soils. The SMAF scoring curves developed using robust algorithms allowed \n\nproper assignment of scores for the soil chemical, physical and biological indicators assessed. \n\nThe SQI scores were significantly correlated with SOC stocks and VESS scores. Long-term \n\ntransition from native vegetation to extensive pasture promoted significant decreases in soil \n\nchemical, physical and biological indicators. Overall SQI suggested that native vegetation \n\nsoils were functioning at 87% their potential capacity, while pasture soils were functioning at \n\n70%. Conversions of pasture to sugarcane induced slight improvements on SQ, primarily \n\nbecause of improved soil fertility. Sugarcane soils are functioning at 74% of their potential \n\ncapacity. Based on this study, management strategies are suggested to improve SQ and the \n\nsustainability of sugarcane production in Brazil. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Land-use change; Ethanol production; Soil quality assessment; Soil quality \n\nindicators \n\n \n\n \n\n6.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nSoil quality/health (SQ) is a key factor required to achieve sustainable agricultural \n\nsystems that will meet our increasing demands for food, feed, fiber and fuels. Therefore, in \n\nrecent decades SQ has been discussed worldwide and become a major agenda item for the \n\nscientific community (KARLEN et al., 2008, KARLEN; PETERSON; WESTFALL, 2014). \n\nSoil quality was defined as the capacity of a specific kind of soil to function, within natural or \n\nmanaged ecosystem boundaries, to sustain plant and animal productivity, maintain or enhance \n\nwater and air quality, and support human health and habitation (KARLEN et al., 1997). It is a \n\nproduct of inherent (e.g., parental material, climate, topography) and anthropogenic (e.g., \n\n\n\n 136 \n\ntillage and cropping systems, land uses) interactions (KARLEN et al., 1997). Soil inherent \n\nattributes are governed by soil-forming processes, and are often relatively unresponsive to soil \n\nand crop management practices. On the other hand, dynamic soil properties (e.g., soil organic \n\ncarbon, pH, soil aggregation, microbial biomass activity) are responsive to management \n\npractices and/or land use, but their change rates are dependent of the inherent soil attributes \n\n(KARLEN et al., 1997; 2008).  \n\nLand-use change processes have transformed a large proportion of the planet\u2019s land \n\nsurface, affecting directly the capacity of soils to function (FOLEY et al., 2005). Increasing \n\nglobal demand for bioenergy feedstock production has intensified the land-use changes in \n\nmany countries (FISCHER et al., 2010; WRIGHT; WIMBERLY, 2013; MUKHERJEE; \n\nSOVACOOL, 2014; GASPARATOS et al., 2015), and especially in Brazil (LAPOLA et al., \n\n2010; GODEMBERG et al., 2014; BORDONAL et al., 2015). Brazil is the world\u2019s largest \n\nsugarcane producer (655 million tons) with about 40% of the global harvest (FOOD AND \n\nAGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS, 2015). The sugarcane \n\ncropped area expanded from 5.8 to 9.0 Mha between 2005 and 2015 (COMPANHIA \n\nNACIONAL DE ABASTECIMENTO, 2015) and is projected to increase by 6.4 Mha to meet \n\nBrazilian domestic demand for ethanol by 2021 (GOLDEMBERG et al., 2014). Recent \n\nexpansion has been concentrated in central-southern Brazil and 70% of the land-use change \n\nhas occurred through conversion of extensive pasturelands (ADAMI et al., 2012). Sugarcane \n\nexpansion initiatives have resulted in degraded pastures being subjected to intensive \n\nmechanization and inputs of agrochemicals (i.e., lime, fertilizer and pesticides) that have \n\ndirect implications on SQ. Therefore, monitoring soil properties (indicators) altered by land-\n\nuse change is crucial for identifying strategies that minimize SQ degradation and its negative \n\nimplications on ecosystem functioning (FU et al., 2015; ZORNOZA et al., 2015).  \n\nTo implement the concepts of SQ and its assessment, the Soil Management \n\nAssessment Framework (SMAF) was initially developed by researchers in the USA on North \n\nAmerican soils (ANDREWS; KARLEN; CAMBARDELLA, 2004). The SMAF is a \n\nquantitative SQ evaluation method that emphasizes a dynamic view of SQ and involves \n\ndetecting soil response to current or recent management decisions (ANDREWS; KARLEN; \n\nCAMBARDELLA, 2004; KARLEN et al., 2014). The SMAF uses a 3-step process to assess \n\nsoil quality, including (i) indicator selection (chemical, physical and biological); (ii) indicator \n\ninterpretation (non-linear scoring curves); and (iii) integration into an overall SQ index (SQI). \n\nAssessment values are generally expressed as a fraction or percentage of full performance for \n\nsoil functions such as crop productivity, nutrient cycling, or environmental protection \n\n\n\n 137 \n\n(ANDREWS; KARLEN; CAMBARDELLA, 2004; KARLEN et al., 2013). Currently, the \n\nSMAF has scoring curves or interpretation algorithms for 13 indicators, which encompass \n\nphysical properties: bulk density (BD), macroaggregate stability (AGS), plant-available water \n\nand water-filled pore space (WFPS); chemical properties: potential of hydrogen (pH), \n\nelectrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio, extractable phosphorus (P) and potassium \n\n(K); and biological properties: soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), \n\npotentially mineralizable N, and ?-glucosidase (BG) activity (ANDREWS; KARLEN; \n\nCAMBARDELLA, 2004; WIENHOLD et al., 2009; STOTT et al., 2010). These scoring \n\ncurves were developed and validated using datasets primarily from North America (USA, \n\nCanada, and Mexico), with the exception of WFPS (which included data from China), and BG \n\n(which included data from Brazil, Argentina and Italy), considering site-specific controlling \n\nfactors (i.e., climate and/or inherent soil properties) that affect the score of each indicator \n\n(ANDREWS; KARLEN; CAMBARDELLA, 2004; WIENHOLD et al., 2009; STOTT et al., \n\n2010). \n\nThe SMAF has been broadly used in the USA for assessing several situations and \n\nfactors that affect both agricultural and natural systems at scales ranging from within-\n\nexperimental field (plots) to regional (e.g., ANDREWS; KARLEN; CAMBARDELLA, 2004; \n\nWIENHOLD et al., 2006; ZOBECK et al., 2014; STOTT et al., 2013; KARLEN et al., 2014; \n\nVEUM et al., 2015) evaluations. In addition, SMAF has been tested in other countries around \n\nworld [e.g., South Africa (SWANEPOEL et al. 2015), Ethiopia (ERKOSSA; ITANNA; \n\nSTAHR, 2007; GELAW; SINGH; LAL, 2015) and Nepal (KALU et al., 2015)]. Data from \n\nBrazilian soils was limited in the development and validation of the SMAF, and to our \n\nknowledge, no other studies using SMAF as tool for assessing the impacts of current \n\nmanagement practices and land uses on SQ in Brazil have been published. The SMAF could \n\nbe an important, user-friendly tool for helping farmers, consultants, researchers and \n\ngovernment officials make immediate and strategic decisions for improving SQ/health and \n\nagricultural sustainability. \n\nTherefore, we conducted an on-farm study across the largest sugarcane-producing \n\nregions of Brazil to assess effects of the primary land-use change sequence associated with \n\nsugarcane expansion (i.e., native vegetation to pasture to sugarcane) on SQ for a wide range \n\nof soil textures using SMAF. We hypothesized that: (i) long-term conversion from native \n\nvegetation to extensive pasture led to significant SQ degradation; (ii) under current practices \n\nsugarcane production soils are recovering SQ attributes lost when used as pasturelands; and \n\n\n\n 138 \n\n(iii) SQ changes in Brazilian tropical soils under different land use and management systems \n\ncould be detected by SMAF. \n\n \n\n6.2 Material and Methods \n\n \n\n6.2.1 Study sites and experimental design  \n\n \n\nThe study sites and experimental design were described in the 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 items. \n\n \n\n6.2.2 Soil sampling and laboratory analyses \n\n \n\nSoil samples within each land use (i.e., native vegetation, pasture and sugarcane) were \n\ncollected using a consistent grid pattern composed of nine points spaced 50 m apart, providing \n\na total of 27 sampling points (3 land uses x 9 points) for each site or 81 sampling points for \n\nthe three studied sites. At each sampling point, a small trench (30 x 30 x 30 cm) was opened \n\nto collect undisturbed soil samples from the 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm depths using metallic \n\ncylinders with volume of about 100 cm\n3\n. This provided a total of 243 undisturbed soil \n\nsamples for soil physical indicators quantification. Around of each central trench, composite \n\nsamples consisting of 12 subsamples were collected using a Dutch auger, at same three \n\ndepths. This provided an additional of 243 disturbed soil samples for chemical and biological \n\nanalyses.  \n\nSeveral soil indicators were analyzed. Chemical indicators included available P and K \n\nas well as active acidity (pHCaCl2 0.01M L\n-1\n\n) which were measured using analytical methods \n\ndescribed in Raij et al. (2001). Physical indicators included bulk density (BD), calculated by \n\ndividing the soil dry mass by volume of the cylinder (100 cm\n3\n), and wet macroaggregate \n\nstability (AGS), determined using a vertical oscillator (Yoder, model MA-148) with three \n\nsieve-sizes (2000, 250, and 53 ?m) and a speed of 30 oscillations per minute for 10 minutes. \n\nThe AGS (% macroaggregation) was calculated by summing aggregate mass for >2000 and \n\n>250 ?m classes, dividing by the total soil mass, and multiplying by 100. Particle-size was \n\ndetermined using a hydrometer method (GEE; OR, 2002). Biological indicators included: a) \n\nsoil organic carbon (SOC), measured by dry combustion on a LECO\n\u00ae\n CN-2000 elemental \n\nanalyzer (furnace at 1350 \u00baC in pure oxygen); b) microbial biomass C (MBC), measured on \n\nthree replicates of field-moist samples after fumigating for 24 h and extracting with 0.5M \n\nK2SO4 (VANCE; BROOKES; JENKINSON, 1987). Organic C in the fumigated and non-\n\n\n\n 139 \n\nfumigated extracts was measured using a TOC-Vcs/cp analyzer attached in a Shimadzu\n\u00ae\n \n\nSSM-5000A (Shimadzu, Kyoto - Japan) before calculating biomass C with a correction factor \n\nof k = 0.33; and c) ?-Glucosidase activity (BG) was measured using air-dried soil as described \n\nby Tabatabai (1994). The concentration of p-nitrophenol was determined in triplicate by \n\nmeasuring absorbance at 400 nm in a spectrophotometer, and results were expressed in mg of \n\np-nitrophenol released kg\n-1\n\n soil h\n-1\n\n. Both MBC and BG activity were analyzed only for 0-10 \n\ncm soil layer.  \n\nData of SOC stocks and Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure (VESS) scores were used \n\nto verify their relationship with SMAF scores. Those measurements were made on soil \n\nsamples collected at the same sites and sampling times and previously reported by Franco et \n\nal. (2015) and Cherubin et al. (2015b), respectively. Briefly, SOC stocks were calculated for \n\neach soil layer by multiplying the SOC content of each one by the soil bulk density and the \n\nlayer thickness (10 cm). To account for the effect of differing soil bulk densities (due to land-\n\nuse change) on stock comparisons, the stocks within the pasture and sugarcane soils were \n\nadjusted to an equivalent soil mass based on measurements for native vegetation (LEE et al., \n\n2009). Subsequently, individual SOC stocks for the 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm layers were \n\nsummed to provide a total SOC stock for 0-30 cm layer.  \n\nVisual Evaluation of Soil Structure (VESS) is a semi-quantitative approach developed \n\nby Ball, Batey and Munkholm (2007) and improved by Guimar\u00e3es, Ball and Tormena (2011) \n\nfor on-farm assessment of the soil physical and structural capacity to support plant growth. \n\nBriefly, a VESS assessment consists of digging out a small trench using a spade and \n\ncollecting a block soil (20 x 10 x 25 cm - approx. 5000 cm\n-3\n\n). The VESS evaluation includes \n\nmanual breakdown of soil aggregates along their weakness lines, identification of layers \n\nhaving contrasting structure, measurement of layer depth and assignment of a score by \n\ncomparing the structure of the sample with the aggregated characteristics proposed by \n\nGuimar\u00e3es, Ball and Tormena (2011). The latter, developed as a VESS key chart, contains \n\ndescriptions, pictures, and a score for each soil structure quality rating. The criteria taken \n\naccount to assign the score are related to shape, size, strength and visible porosity of \n\naggregates, as well as biological activity and presence of root inter- or intra-aggregates. The \n\nsoil structural quality scores range from 1 (good) to 5 (poor), with 3 being considered a \n\ncritical limit for suitable plant growth (BALL; BATEY; MUNKHOLM, 2007).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 140 \n\n6.2.3 Soil Management Assessment Framework \n\n \n\nThe SMAF was used as tool to evaluate the land-use change effects on SQ. The \n\nminimum dataset included eight soil indicators (pH, P, K, BD, AGS, SOC, MBC and BG) for \n\n0-10 cm layer and six soil indicators (pH, P, K, BD, AGS and SOC) for 10-20 and 20-30 cm \n\nlayers. The importance of each one of these indicators to soil functionality is consistently \n\nreported in the literature (e.g., ANDREWS; KARLEN; CAMBARDELLA, 2004; STOTT et \n\nal., 2010; CARDOSO et al., 2013; ZORNOZA et al., 2015). The pH, available P and K \n\nprovide information about soil acidity and nutrient availability status. Macroaggregation \n\nstability and BD indicate soil structural and physical conditions, which affect soil aeration, \n\nwater infiltration and storage and soil\u2019s ability to resist erosion process. Soil organic carbon, \n\nMBC and BG were chosen as biological indicators. The SOC plays crucial role in multiple \n\nsoil processes including nutrient cycling and storage, food source for edaphic organisms and \n\nsoil aggregation; while MBC and BG indicate the microbiological and biochemical activity of \n\nthe soils.  \n\nThis approach is consistent with the general SMAF guidelines, which recommend \n\nusing a minimum of five indicators with at least one each representing soil chemical, physical \n\nand biological properties and processes (KARLEN et al., 2008). These indicators were scored \n\nby transforming mean measured values into 0 - 1 values using previously published \n\nalgorithms (ANDREWS; KARLEN; CAMBARDELLA, 2004; WIENHOLD et al., 2009; \n\nSTOTT et al., 2010), which were used to compute an overall SQI for each land use and \n\nstudied site. Those algorithms account for organic matter, texture, climate, slope, region, \n\nmineralogy, weathering class, crop, sampling time, and analytical method effects on the \n\nvarious threshold values. For this study, the organic matter factor class (based on soil \n\nclassification and used for scoring AGS, SOC, MBC and BG) was 4 (low OM) for all sites. \n\nThe texture factor class (used for scoring BD, AGS, SOC, MBC and BG) was 2 (clay content \n\n~17%) at Lat_21S and pasture in Lat_17S and 4 (clay contents >40%) at Lat_17S (except \n\npasture) and Lat_23S. The climate factor (used for scoring SOC, MBC and BG) was 1 (?170\u00ba \n\ndays and ?550 mm of mean annual precipitation) for all sites. The seasonal factor, impacting \n\nMBC scores, was 2 (sampling on summer - January) for all sites. The Fe oxide, used for AGS \n\nscores, was 1 (Ultisol) for Lat_21S and 2 (other soils) for other sites. The mineralogy factor \n\nclass, used for scoring BD, were 3 (clay 1:1 and Fe and Al oxides) and the slope and \n\nweathering class factors, used for scoring P, were 2 (2-5% slope) and 2 (high weathering), \n\nrespectively, for all sites. The method used to measure extractable P was resin (class 5). We \n\n\n\n 141 \n\nchanged resin method factor from 3.1 to 1.25, to avoid overestimating the P scores under low \n\nP conditions in weathered soils. New crop factors, which affecting P and pH scores, needed to \n\nbe added to SMAF spreadsheet for encompassing Brazilian natural vegetation (Cerrado and \n\nAtlantic forest), tropical grass (Brachiaria spp. and Cynodon spp.) and sugarcane. Phosphorus \n\nand pH thresholds for each \u201cnew crop\u201d were set up using literature and expert\u2019s opinions. \n\nOptimum P and pH values were: 6 mg dm\n-3\n\n and 4.5 for Cerrado vegetation; 12 mg dm\n-3\n\n and \n\n5.5 for Atlantic forest; 13 mg dm\n-3\n\n and 5.5 for pasture; and 16 mg dm\n-3\n\n and 6.0 for sugarcane \n\n(RAIJ et al., 1997). The SMAF algorithms are based on pHwater, therefore, pHCaCl2 was \n\nconverted to pHwater by the regression fitted in Ciprandi (1993), pHwater = 0.890 + 0.922 \n\npHCaCl2 (r\n2\n = 0.97, p&lt;0.05). The SMAF scoring curve for K (WIENHOLD et al., 2009) is \n\nconsistent with K recommendation classes adopted in Brazil (RAIJ et al., 1997).    \n\n In addition to individual indicator scores, an overall SQI was calculated by summing \n\nthe scores and dividing by the number of indicators for each soil layer. The overall SQI was \n\nalso subdivided into chemical (pH, P and K), physical (BD and AGS) and biological (SOC, \n\nMBC, and BG) sectors, as well as its relative contribution into overall SQI. This approach \n\nidentifies the management areas of greatest concern (i.e., lowest index scores) so that land \n\nmanagers can be given better guidance on how to most efficiently restore or improve SQ at \n\nthat specific location (STOTT et al., 2013, KARLEN et al., 2014). \n\n \n\n6.2.4 Data analyses \n\n \n\nAn analysis of variance (ANOVA) was computed using PROC GLM procedure to test \n\nthe influence of the land-use change within each site on individual soil indicators, SMAF \n\nscores and overall SQI values. If the ANOVA F statistic was significant (p<0.05), the means \n\nwere compared using Tukey\u2019s test (p<0.05). The analyses were performed separately by \n\ndepth. An additional ANOVA was computed to test the land-use change effects in regional \n\nscale (all sites simultaneously) on overall SQI and SQI-sectors scores for 0-30 cm layer. \n\nMeans were also compared using Tukey\u2019s test (p<0.05). Finally, regression analyses were \n\nperformed using PROC REG procedure between SMAF scores and SOC stocks within each \n\nsite for 0-30 cm depth, and between SMAF scores and VESS scores for sites with contrasting \n\ntexture (Lat_21S: sandy soils; Lat_23S: clay soils). All statistical procedures were completed \n\nusing the software Statistical Analysis System \u2013 SAS v.9.3 (SAS Inc, Cary, USA). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 142 \n\n6.3 Results and Discussion \n\n \n\n6.3.1 Soil chemical indicators \n\n \n\nSoil chemical conditions were typical for tropical regions (Table 1). Soils of Cerrado \n\nbiome in central-southern Brazil are highly weathering and characterized by high acidity and \n\nlow nutrient availability, as shown by Lopes and Cox (1977). The transition from native \n\nvegetation to extensive pasture led to soil acidification and decreased nutrient levels, \n\nespecially available P (Table 1). Soil acidification and nutrient depletions were the result of \n\nlong-term (>30 years) soil use with continuous grazing and the absence of lime and fertilizer \n\ninputs as indicated by Cherubin et al. (2015a). Higher K levels under pasture at Lat_21S and \n\nLat_23S could be attributed to several factors such as greater K cycling, lower K losses \n\n(KAYSER; ISSELSTEIN, 2005), and release of non-exchangeable K forms by aggressive \n\nroot system of grasses (ROSOLEN; VICENTINI; STEINER, 2012).  \n\nThe algorithms used in the SMAF were sensitive to detect the score changes for the \n\nchemical indicators under tropical conditions in Brazil (Table 2). As expected, we needed to \n\nadd new \u201ccrop factors\u201d into SMAF spreadsheet labeled as Brazilian Cerrado vegetation, \n\nAtlantic Forest vegetation, Brazilian tropical grasses (Brachiaria spp. and Cynodon spp.) and \n\nsugarcane. The SMAF scoring curves for pH and P have a parabolic shape denoting an \n\noptimum range, which takes into account crop-specific critical limits to sustain plant growth \n\nwithout causing environmental deleterious impacts (e.g., fresh water contamination). In \n\ngeneral, the results showed that conversion of native vegetation to pasture decreased pH \n\nscores (average from 0.92 to 0.69) and P scores (average from 0.90 to 0.62), mainly at \n\nLat_17S and Lat_21S sites (Table 2). The SMAF scoring curves for K also have a parabolic \n\nshape; however it was set up using a general response of crops to soil K levels according to \n\nWienhold et al. (2009). Therefore, the K scores were lower than pH and P scores, especially \n\nat Lat_17S (more weathered soil) with averages of 0.38 and 0.19 under native vegetation and \n\npasture, respectively. For Lat_21S and Lat_23S, K scores increased from native vegetation \n\n(average from 0.67 and 0.76) to pasture (average from 0.76 and 0.96) (Table 2). \n\n  \n\n\n\n 143 \n\nTable 1 - Mean values of the soil quality indicators\n\u00a7\n from 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm soil \n\nlayers under native vegetation (NV), pasture (PA) and sugarcane (SC) in central-\n\nsouthern Brazil \n\nSite \nLand \n\nuse \n\nMean indicator values \nChemical  Physical  Biological \n\npH P K BD AGS SOC MBC BG \nunit mg dm\n\n-3\n mg dm\n\n-3\n Mg m\n\n-3\n % g kg\n\n-1\n mg kg\n\n-1\n \u00b5g g h\n\n-1\n \n\nLat_17S \n\n0-10 cm \nNV 4.4 b\n\n\u2020\n 5.6 a 39.8 a  1.23 b 90.9 a 15.6 a    397.2\n\nns\n     49.7\n\nns\n \n\nPA   4.3 b 3.0 b 23.8 b 1.63 a 92.8 a 9.5 b    301.5     40.0 \nSC   5.6 a 7.3 a 23.8 b 1.26 b 73.3 b 10.8 b    414.8     47.2 \n\n10-20 cm \nNV 4.4 b 4.5 b 30.5 a 1.28 b 88.7 b 12.9 a - - \nPA 4.4 b 2.6 c 19.2 b 1.61 a 93.3 a 8.4 b - - \nSC 5.6 a 7.0 a 22.3 b 1.54 a 78.5 c 10.4 b - - \n\n20-30 cm \nNV 4.5 b 3.5 b 27.0 a 1.28 b 88.7 b 11.2 a - - \nPA 4.4 b 2.5 c 18.8 b 1.63 a 93.6 a 6.4 b - - \nSC 5.4 a 4.7 a 18.0 b 1.51 a 84.4 b 9.7 a - - \n\nLat_21S \n\n0-10 cm \nNV 6.8 a 17.3 a 108.7 b 1.20 b 92.1 a 21.8 a 870.4 a 122.6 c \nPA 4.5 c 7.1 b  163.0 a 1.53 a 86.2 a 13.3 b 438.5 b 273.2 a \nSC 5.8 b 19.6 a 120.8 ab 1.62 a 60.5 b 11.1 b 539.9 b 200.6 b \n\n10-20 cm \nNV 6.7 a 12.5 a 113.0 a 1.32 b    72.8\n\n ns\n 16.0 a - - \n\nPA 4.5 c 3.9 b 133.3 a 1.65 a    86.2 9.5 b - - \nSC 5.6 b 13.2 a 113.8 a 1.68 a    69.9 9.9 b - - \n\n20-30 cm \nNV 6.7 a 9.9 a   93.5 b 1.38 b 71.5\n\n ns\n 13.1 a - - \n\nPA 4.5 c 3.2 b  120.4 a 1.65 a  81.7 7.5 b - - \nSC 5.2 b 7.8 a 102.8 ab 1.68 a 73.4 8.0 b - - \n\nLat_23S \n\n0-10 cm \nNV 4.3 c 14.3 a 109.1 b 0.89 b 93.8 a 36.7 a 1978.7 a 337.8 a \nPA 5.2 b 11.5 ab 170.1 a 1.30 a 95.8 a 36.4 a 2085.9 a 115.7 b \nSC 5.9 a 8.8 b 120.4 b 1.33 a 84.3 b 18.9 b 928.6 b 53.8 c \n\n10-20 cm \nNV 4.3 c 12.4 a 95.4 b 1.03 b 93.9 a 33.7 a - - \nPA 5.1 b 9.8 ab 174.4 a 1.41 a 97.2 a 27.6 a - - \nSC 5.8 a  8.6 b 90.7 b 1.44 a 83.3 b 18.4 b - - \n\n20-30 cm \nNV 4.3 c 11.0 a 90.3 b 1.06 b 92.0 ab 30.3 a - - \nPA 5.0 b 7.6 b 158.4 a 1.39 a 96.8 a 20.6 b - - \nSC 5.9 a 7.2 b 77.4 b 1.44 a 88.0 b 17.3 b - - \n\n\u00a7\npH: potential of hydrogen, P: phosphorus, K: potassium, BD: bulk density, AGS: macroaggregate stability, \n\nSOC: soil organic carbon, MBC: microbial biomass carbon, BG: ?-Glucosidase activity;

Sugarcane management including lime applications resulted in higher pH \n\n\n\n 145 \n\nvalues in all sites, with average increasing from 4.6 (pasture) to 5.6 (sugarcane) (Table 1) and \n\naverage pH scores from 0.69 (pasture) to 0.86 (sugarcane) (Table 2). Applications of mineral \n\nfertilizer and complementary organic residues in sugarcane fields increased P levels and \n\nscores (from 0.47 to 0.81) and increased or maintained K levels (average scores 0.48 for \n\npasture and 0.47 for sugarcane) at Lat_17S and Lat_21S. Although both P and K levels had \n\nimprovements with sugarcane cultivation, they were still below of the critical limits, P >16 \n\nmg dm\n-3\n\n and K >120 mg dm\n-3\n\n, established by Raij et al. (1997). In contrast, lower P and K \n\nlevels and scores were found in sugarcane field compared to pasture at Lat_23S (Table 1), \n\nlikely associated with the management of fertilization using insufficient amount of organic \n\nresidues as verified by Cherubin et al. (2015a) and due to significant SOM depletions \n\n(FRANCO et al., 2015).  \n\nAll measurements for pH, P and K were concentrated at the increasing part of SMAF \n\nparabolic curves, confirming that acidity and low plant available P and K levels are the \n\nlimiting factors for sugarcane production under Brazilian weathered soils. \n\n \n\n6.3.2 Soil physical indicators \n\n \n\nThe land-use change from native vegetation to pasture induced soil compaction by \n\nincreasing BD values (Table 1). Many studies have shown that cattle trampling is the major \n\ndriver for soil compaction under pasture (e.g., GREENWOOD; McKENZIE, 2001; \n\nPIETOLA; HORN; YLI-HALLA, 2005). In addition, low pasture productivity (shoot and \n\nroots) has been verified under compacted soils, reducing C inputs into the soil (MAIA et al., \n\n2009; FRANCO et al., 2015), contributing to an increase in the soil structural degradation. \n\nThe SMAF scoring curves for BD (less-is-better sigmoidal shapes), which take into account \n\ntexture and mineralogical classes (ANDREWS; KARLEN; CAMBARDELLA, 2004), were \n\nable to identify alterations on BD due to land-use change effects (Table 2). The BD scores \n\ndecreased from native vegetation (average 0.85) to pasture (average 0.44).  \n\nRegarding macroaggregation stability (AGS), higher values were found under native \n\nvegetation and pasture, ranging from >70% in sandy soils (Lat_21S) and >90% in clay soils \n\n(Lat_23S). High AGS values are typically reported in studies under weathered Brazilian soils \n\n(e.g., MADARI et al., 2005; BARTH\u00c8S et al., 2008), being associated primarily with a clay \n\nmineral composition dominated by Fe and Al oxides and 1:1 mineral layering in these soils \n\n(SIX; ELLIOTT; PAUSTIAN, 2000). In addition, Franco (2015) verified that soil macrofauna \n\nabundance plays important role in the soil aggregation processes in tropical soils; therefore, \n\n\n\n 146 \n\ngreater AGS under native vegetation and pasture are consistent with higher abundance of soil \n\nengineering invertebrates (i.e., earthworms and termites) in these areas (FRANCO, 2015). \n\nThe SMAF scoring curves for AGS (more-is-better sigmoidal shapes) takes into account \n\ndifferences in SOM, texture and Fe oxides content (ANDREWS; KARLEN; \n\nCAMBARDELLA, 2004). However, for all possible variations of these factors, the maximum \n\nscore (1.0) is assigned when the AGS values are higher than 50% (threshold value from which \n\nsoil structural stability is optimum for environment protection and productivity goals). \n\nTherefore, using the current SMAF scoring curves, AGS scores was a non-sensitive indicator \n\nto detect land-use change impacts in tropical soils, reaching practically score 1.0 for all sites \n\n(Table 2). Macroaggregation stability has been globally used as SQ indicator (CARDOSO et \n\nal., 2013; KARLEN et al., 2013, 2014; STOTT et al., 2013; ZORNOZA et al., 2015) due to \n\nits crucial role on C stabilization and protection, mediating soil physical processes related to \n\nwater and air dynamic and providing resistance against soil erosion. Therefore, additional \n\nSMAF scoring curves for AGS need to be developed for applying and detecting smaller \n\nchanges caused by recent land use and management under well-aggregated tropical soils. \n\nConversion from pasture to sugarcane have been done through intensive \n\nmechanization raising the concern on soil compaction. Although BD had no significant \n\ndifferences between sugarcane and pasture, the values found in sugarcane [>1.2 Mg dm\n-3\n\n for \n\nclay soil and >1.6 Mg dm\n-3\n\n for sandy soils (Table 1)] are considered critical for sustaining \n\nadequate plant growth as shown by Reynolds et al. (2002). Using SMAF, the average BD \n\nscore was 0.41 (Table 2), confirming that soil compaction is one of major driver to SQ \n\ndegradation under sugarcane fields. Tillage operations carried out during sugarcane replanting \n\n(~ every 5 years) alleviated soil compaction (i.e., decreased BD), but this positive effect was \n\nlimited to the surface layer (10 cm depth) in the sugarcane field at Lat_17S and probably has \n\nshort-term persistence as verified in other Brazilian soils by Silva et al. (2012). In addition, \n\nsoil tillage promoted breakup of the macroaggregates and, SOC and macrofauna losses, \n\ndecreasing AGS values under sugarcane production (Table 1). As discussed previously, even \n\nthough AGS depletions were statistically significant, AGS scores were close to 1, generally \n\nequal those found under native vegetation and pasture (Table 2).  \n\n \n\n6.3.3 Soil biological indicators \n\n \n\nGreater SOC contents were found under native vegetation, ranging from 11.2 to 36.7 g \n\nkg\n-1\n\n (Table 1), depending of soil taxonomic class, texture and climate. These factors are taken \n\n\n\n 147 \n\ninto account in the SMAF scoring curves (more-is-better sigmoidal shapes) for SOC thus \n\naccounting for inherent soil characteristics that can affect the score (ANDREWS; KARLEN; \n\nCAMBARDELLA, 2004). The land-use change from native vegetation to pasture decreased \n\nSOC content (Table 1) and average scores from 0.95 to 0.79 (Table 2). These SOC losses in \n\ntropical regions are well documented in the literature (MAIA et al., 2009; MELLO et al., \n\n2014; FRANCO et al., 2015) as result of conversion process and low C inputs due to low \n\ngrass productivity and inadequate grazing management. The MBC values were high in all \n\nsites, especially in more clay soil (Lat_23S). Conversions from native vegetation to pasture \n\ntrend to decrease MBC at Lat_17S and Lat_21S (Table 1), similar to that observed for SOC, \n\nconfirming the close relationship between MBC and SOC (r = 0.88 p<0.01). Regardless of \n\nsite and effects of land-use change, the SMAF scores for MBC ranged from 0.95 to 1.0, \n\nwithout differences among land uses (Table 2). These results are consistent with study of  \n\nLopes et al. (2013), who defined that MBC values > 375 mg kg\n-1\n\n are classified as high under \n\nclayey Oxisols in Brazilian Cerrado.  \n\nThe BG activity responses to land-use change were statistically different within each \n\nsite. At Lat_23S, BG values significantly decreased from native vegetation to pasture. In \n\ncontrast, significantly higher BG was found under pasture compared to native vegetation at \n\nLat_21S, probably associated with higher pH under native vegetation soil (Table 1). The \n\nSMAF scores for BG decreased from native vegetation (1.0) to pasture (0.84) at Lat_23S, \n\nthere was a slight increase from native vegetation (0.91) to pasture (1.0) at Lat_21S and there \n\nwere not significant differences at Lat_17S, in which the lowest scores were observed (Table \n\n2). The SMAF scoring curves for BG were sensitive to alterations induced by land-use \n\nchange. The inclusion of a dataset from Brazilian Cerrado soils for the development and \n\nvalidation of the SMAF-BG algorithms (STOTT et al., 2010) likely contributed to the good \n\nperformance for the soils of this study. In addition, previously, Lopes et al. (2013) had \n\nverified that critical limits for BG activity defined as function of crop yield and SOC in clayey \n\nBrazilian Oxisols were consistent with SMAF-BG scores (i.e., values in the low and high \n\ninterpretative classes were equivalent to SMAF-BG scores of 0.85 and 0.32, respectively). \n\nShort-term transitions from pasture to sugarcane (<5 years) did not promote \n\nsignificant SOC changes at Lat_17S and Lat_21S (Table 1). However, after more than 20 \n\nyears of sugarcane including approximately 10 years of burning pre-harvest, significant SOC \n\ndepletion and reduced MBC and BG activity at Lat_23S (Table 1) was observed. For that site, \n\nSOC scores showed a slight decrease from pasture (1.0) to sugarcane (0.98), MBC scores \n\nshowed no differences and BG scores had marked depletion under sugarcane field (0.23). \n\n\n\n 148 \n\nThese results are consistent with large studies recently carried out in central-southern Brazil \n\nby Mello et al. (2013) and Bordonal et al. (2015).  \n\n \n\n6.3.4 Overall Soil Quality Index and scores \n\n \n\nOverall SQI and SQI sectors (i.e., chemical, physical and biological) for each depth \n\nand site are shown in Figure 1 and in regional scale (Figure 2) for the 0-30 cm. The SQI \n\ncomputed for each depths (0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm) indicated that SQ decreased in depth, \n\nregardless of the land use and site. Several factors contribute for improving SQ in the first \n\ncentimeters, such as inputs of C from litter and crop residues on the soil surface, greater \n\nbiological and biochemical activity, higher nutrient cycling and fertilizer inputs, better soil \n\nstructure and physical resistance as well as better soil resilience to stress due to animal \n\ntrampling and machinery traffic. We highlighted that SMAF scores calculated for deeper \n\nlayers (<15 cm depth) must be carefully interpreted, since SMAF scoring algorithms were \n\noriginally developed for near surface soils.  \n\nThe highest SQI were verified in the native vegetation soils ranging from 0.72 to 0.77 \n\nat Lat_17S, from 0.87 to 0.92 at Lat_21S and from 0.94 to 0.97 at Lat_23S. In regional scale, \n\naverage SQI suggests these soils are functioning at 87% of their potential capacity for the 0-\n\n30 cm layer (Figure 2). The SQI-sectors were also higher under native vegetation for all \n\nstudied sites and depths (Figures 1 and 2). These results demonstrate that natural ecosystems \n\nare in dynamic balance, where chemical, physical and biological attributes act cooperatively \n\nin such way that soils perform their functions properly. Conversion from native vegetation to \n\npasture promoted significant SQ degradation, with SQI values ranging from 0.51 to 0.77, 0.61 \n\nto 0.85 and 0.86 to 0.92 at Lat_17S, Lat_21S and Lat_23S, respectively. In regional scale, \n\naverage SQI suggests these soils are functioning at 70% of their potential capacity for the 0-\n\n30 cm layer (Figure 2). Long-term land use with extensive pasture led to chemical \n\nimpoverishment of the soil, increasing soil compaction and its deleterious impacts on soil \n\nphysical processes and negative impacts on biological indicators driven by SOC depletions, as \n\nevidenced by SQI-sectors scores in Figure 2B. Recent estimates suggest that 70% of Brazilian \n\npasturelands are degraded or in the process of being degraded (DIAS-FILHO, 2014), and SQ \n\ndegradation caused by inadequate management of pasture and animals is considered the major \n\ndriver of this process. We believe that investigations using robust frameworks, such as \n\nSMAF, for assessing SQ under extensive pasture in Brazil could help farmers make the best \n\ndecision about more sustainable uses for their lands and guide government\u2019s strategic \n\n\n\n 149 \n\nplanning for agriculture expansion and/or funding the adoption of strategies for recovery \n\ndegraded pasturelands (e.g., Low-Carbon Agriculture program). \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n   \n \n\nFigure 1 - Overall soil quality index (SQI) scores and the contribution of chemical, physical \n\nand biological attributes into the overall SQI under native vegetation (NV), pasture \n\n(PA) and sugarcane (SC) for the 0-10 (A;D;G - left), 10-20 (B;E;H - central)  and \n\n20-30 cm (C;F;I - right) layers at Lat_17S (A;B;C), Lat_21S (D;E;F) and Lat_23S \n\n(G;H;I) in central-southern Brazil. \u2020Mean SQI scores within each site in same depth \nfollowed by the same capital letter do not differ among themselves according to Tukey\u2019s test \n\n(p<0.05); \u00a7Mean sectors contribution within each site in same depth followed by the same lower \n\nletter do not differ among themselves according to Tukey\u2019s test (p<0.05) \n\na \nc \n\nb \n\na \n\nb \n\na \n\na\u00a7 \n\nb \n\nb \n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nNV PA SC\n\nS\nQ\n\nI \nsc\n\no\nr\ne\ns \n\nA \n\nA\u2020 \n\nC \n\nB \n\n0-10 cm \n\na \n\nc \nb \n\na \n\nb \n\nb \n\na \n\nb \n\nb \n\nNV PA SC\n\nBiological\nPhysical\nChemical\n\nB \n\nC \n\nA \n\nB \n\n10-20 cm \n\na \nc \n\nb \n\na \n\nb \nb \n\na \n\nc \n\nb \n\nNV PA SC\n\nC \n\nA \n\nC \nB \n\n20-30 cm \n\na b a \n\na \nb c \n\na \na a \n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nNV PA SC\n\nS\nQ\n\nI \nsc\n\no\nr\ne\ns \n\nD \nA \n\nB B \n\na \nb \n\na \n\na \n\nb \n\nb \n\na \n\nb \n\nb \n\nNV PA SC\n\nE \n\nB \n\nC \n\nA \n\na \nb a \n\na \n\nb \nb \n\na \n\nb \nb \n\nNV PA SC\n\nF \n\nB \nC \n\nA \n\nab a b \n\na b \nb \n\na \nb \n\nc \n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nNV PA SC\n\nS\nQ\n\nI \nsc\n\no\nr\ne\ns \n\nLand use \n\nG A\n \n\nB \n\nC \n\na a b \n\na b \nb \n\na \na \n\nb \n\nNV PA SC\n\nLand use \n\nH A \nB \n\nC \n\na a b \n\na \nb \n\nb \n\na \na \n\nb \n\nNV PA SC\n\nLand use \n\nI A \n\nB \nC \n\n\n\n 150 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2 - Overall soil quality index (SQI) scores (A) and SQI sector (chemical, physical and \n\nbiological) scores (B), 0-30 cm layer, for regional scale of land-use change [i.e., \n\nnative vegetation (NV) \u2013 pasture (PA) \u2013 sugarcane (SC)] for sugarcane expansion \n\nin Brazil.

In regional scale (Figure 2) the SQI indicated that sugarcane \n\nexpansion under extensive pasture led to slight, but significant improvement on SQ. \n\nTherefore, sugarcane soils are functioning at 74% their potential capacity within 0-30 cm \n\nlayer. This SQ improvement was driven by inputs of lime and fertilizer, which significantly \n\nincreased chemical SQI-sector (Figure 2B). These findings demonstrate how important the \n\nproper management of fertilization is in the agricultural systems for sustaining SQ in tropical \n\nregions. Physical and biological SQI-sectors had no differences between sugarcane and \n\npasture soils, which had average decreases of 22 and 15% their physical and biological \n\nfunctioning capacity compared with native vegetation soils.   \n\nOur SQ assessment, based on SMAF scores, suggests that sugarcane cultivation has \n\nimproved soil quality compared to extensive pasturelands. Therefore, sugarcane expansion \n\nreintegrates degraded pasturelands into a productive system, providing more economical and \n\nsocial benefits with positive environmental offsets [i.e., improving soil quality, saving \n\ngreenhouse gas emissions (MELLO et al., 2014; BORDONAL et al., 2015) and alleviating \n\ndeforestation of natural ecosystems (MELLO et al., 2014; GOLDEMBERG et al., 2014)]. \n\nHowever, to avoid future SQ decline in sugarcane fields we recommend the adoption of \n\nmanagement strategies (e.g., maintenance of sugarcane straw on soil surface, application of \n\norganic residues as complementary fertilization, minimum or no-tillage system associated to \n\ncrop rotation, controlled machinery traffic), which ensure proper soil fertility to achieve \n\nnutritional demands of sugarcane crop, improve soil C sequestration and mitigate deleterious \n\nimpacts from tillage and machine traffic on soil physical properties and processes.  \n\n \n\n6.3.4 Overall Soil Quality Index versus SOC stocks and VESS scores \n\n \n\nGlobally, SOC is the most common single indicator used for assessing impacts of the \n\nland-use changes and agricultural management practices on SQ and its multiple ecosystems \n\nservices (CARDOSO et al., 2013; ZORNOZA et al., 2015). In Brazil, several studies have \n\nassessed the sustainability of biofuel crops expansion through SOC stock changes (FRAZ\u00c3O \n\net al., 2014; MELLO et al., 2014; FRANCO et al., 2015). In the United States, Soil \n\nConditioning Index was adopted by the USDA-NRCS to investigate effects of agricultural \n\npractices on SOC, and infer changes in SQ (USDA-NRCS, 2003). Zobeck et al. (2008, 2014) \n\n\n\n 152 \n\ncompared agricultural management effects using Soil Conditioning Index and SMAF-SQI. \n\nThe authors concluded that both methodologies were able to identify SQ changes; however, \n\nsince SMAF includes several chemical, physical and biological indicators, it provides more \n\ndetailed information about soil quality than Soil Conditioning Index.  \n\n Linear regressions between SOC stocks and SQI scores obtained using SMAF are \n\nshown in Figure 3. Soil organic carbon stocks explained between 53 to 78% of the variation in \n\noverall SQI. These finding support two important statements: (i) changes in SOC stocks \n\nresults in modifications in physical, chemical and biological attributes of SQ, which are \n\nencompassed in the SMAF-SQI scores, supporting SOC as a universal indicator of SQ. \n\nHowever, when multiple indicators are used together the SQ assessment becomes more \n\naccurate and enables to identify which critical conditions need priority management (e.g., soil \n\nfertility, soil compaction, biological activity, etc); and (ii) these strong positive correlations \n\nvalidated SQI scores, since SOC stock is broadly recognized as a suitable endpoint for \n\nenvironmental protection and crop productivity management goals.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3 - Relationship between soil organic carbon stocks and overall soil quality index \n\n(SQI) scores, 0-30 cm layer, for the land-use change [i.e., native vegetation (NV) \u2013 \n\npasture (PA) \u2013 sugarcane (SC)] at three sites (Lat_17S, Lat_21S and Lat_23S) in \n\ncentral-southern Brazil \n\n \n\n We also verified significant relationship between SQI-physical sector and overall SQI \n\nscores with VESS scores (Figure 4). Our results showed that the variation in SQI-physical sector \n\nSQI Lat_17S = 0.186 + 0.014x   \n\nr\u00b2 = 0.72 p<0.001 \n\nSQI Lat_21S = 0.587 + 0.005x \n\nr\u00b2 = 0.53 p<0.001 \n\nSQI Lat_23S = 0.642 + 0.004x  \n\nr\u00b2 = 0.78 p<0.001 \n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\nS\nQ\n\nI \nsc\n\no\nr\ne\n \n\nSoil Organic Carbon Stock (Mg ha-1) \n\nLat_17S\n\nLat_21S\n\nLat_23S\n\n\n\n 153 \n\nand overall SQI can be explained by VESS at 56 and 51% under sandy soils and at 32 and \n\n25% under clay soils, respectively. Using the equations described in Figure 4 and the critical \n\nvalue of VESS= 3, it was verified that SQI-physical and overall SQI reached values that \n\ncorresponding to 76 and 82% of physical functioning and, 80 and 89% of overall functioning \n\nrespectively for sandy and clay soils. We assume that a sharper decline in SQI-physical and SQI \n\nscores must be observed when VESS scores are greater than 4, which were not found in the \n\nstudied sites.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 4 - Relationship among Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure (VESS) scores, overall \n\nsoil quality index (SQI) and SQI-Physical sector scores under native vegetation, \n\npasture and sugarcane areas in central-southern Brazil \n\n \n\nThese results suggest that VESS measures more than soil structural quality, with \n\nadvantages of to be an on-farm method, simple to perform and easy to understand \n\n(GUIMAR\u00c3ES; BALL; TORMENA, 2011; BALL; MUNKHOLM; BATEY, 2013; \n\nMULLER et al., 2013). Therefore, the VESS method could be used as a complementary tool \n\nfor monitoring SQ in areas undergoing land-use change for sugarcane expansion in Brazil. In \n\naddition, we suggest that VESS could be further included into the SMAF or used to replace \n\nother soil physical properties. Thereby, studies in a wide range of soils and agricultural \n\nmanagements systems are necessary to developed reliable SMAF scoring curves for VESS.  \n\n \n\n \n\nSQI-Physical = 1.088 - 0.109x \n\n    r\u00b2 = 0.56  p<0.001 \n\nSQI = 1.012 - 0.071x  \n\nr\u00b2 = 0.51  p<0.001 \n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nS\nc\no\nr\ne\n \n\nVESS score \n\nSandy soils \n\nSQI-Physical\n\nSQI\n\nSQI-Physical = 1.087 - 0.090x  \n\n   r\u00b2 = 0.32 p<0.001 \n\nSQI = 1.019 - 0.044x  \nr\u00b2 = 0.25 p<0.002 \n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nVESS score \n\nClay soils \n\nSQI-Physical\n\nSQI\n\n\n\n 154 \n\n6.4 Conclusions \n\n \n\nThis study was the first application of SMAF for assessing SQ changes in Brazil and \n\nconfirmed our hypothesis that SMAF would be sensitive enough to detect SQ changes \n\nassociated with sugarcane expansion. In general, the SMAF scoring curves developed \n\nprimarily on North American soils properly assigned scores for soil chemical, physical and \n\nbiological indicators included in this study. The SMAF indicator scores were useful for \n\nevaluating which sectors require priority management, while overall SQI score integrated all \n\nsectored information into a single value, enabling to detect global SQ changes induced by \n\nland-use change impacts. Overall SQI calculated by SMAF was positively correlated with \n\nSOC stocks (r\n2\n = 0.53 to 0.78), which is recognized for its multiples ecosystems functions. In \n\naddition, SQI was negatively correlated with VESS scores (r\n2\n = 0.25 to 0.51), a simpler semi-\n\nquantitative method that has showed potential for on-farm monitoring of SQ changes. \n\nTherefore, the SMAF was a reliable and efficient tool to detect the land-use change effects on \n\nSQ under Brazilian tropical conditions. However, futures studies are encouraged to adjust and \n\nvalidate SMAF algorithms using dataset from tropical soils and expanding its use around the \n\nworld. \n\nOur findings suggest that native vegetation land use had the greatest SQ, with soils \n\nfunctioning on average at 87% of their potential capacity. Replacing native vegetation by \n\npasture decreased SQ to 70% of its potential capacity. Land-use change from pasture to \n\nsugarcane induced slight improvements on SQ, mainly driven by increasing on soil chemical \n\nquality. Overall, sugarcane soils are functioning at 74% of their potential capacity. Based in \n\nthis study, management strategies that sustain proper soil fertility for sugarcane growth, \n\nincrease soil C sequestration and alleviate soil compaction and erosion are recommended to \n\nimprove SQ and the sustainability of sugarcane production in Brazil. \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\nADAMI, M.; RUDORFF, B.F.T.; FREITAS, R.M.; AGUIAR, D.A.; SUGAWARA, M.; \n\nMELLO, M.P.

Assessments of soil quality (SQ) response to \n\nthis LUC are essential for quantifying and monitoring sustainability of sugarcane production \n\nover time. Since there is not a universal methodology for assessing SQ, we conducted a field-\n\nstudy at three sites within the largest sugarcane-producing region of Brazil to develop a SQ \n\nindex (SQI). The most common LUC scenario (i.e., native vegetation to pasture to sugarcane) \n\nwas evaluated using six SQI strategies with varying complexities. Thirty eight soil indicators \n\nwere included in the total dataset. Two minimum datasets were selected: one using principal \n\ncomponent analysis (7 indicators) and the other based on expert opinion (5 indicators). Non-\n\nlinear scoring curves were used to interpret the indicator values. Simple and weighted additive \n\nmethods were used to combine individual indicator scores into an overall SQI. Long-term \n\nconversion from native vegetation to extensive pasture significantly decreased overall SQ. In \n\ncontrast, conversion from pasture to sugarcane had no significant impact on overall SQ at the \n\nregional scale, but site-specific responses were found. In general, sugarcane production \n\nimproved chemical attributes; however it has negative effects on physical and biological \n\nattributes. Overall, we found that simple, user-friendly strategies were as effective as more \n\ncomplex ones for identifying SQ changes. Therefore, as a protocol for SQ assessments in \n\nBrazilian sugarcane areas, we recommend using a small number of indicators [e.g., pH, P, K, \n\nVisual Evaluation of Soil Structure (VESS) scores and SOC concentration] and proportional \n\nweighting to reflect chemical, physical and biological processes within the soil. Our SQ \n\nevaluations also suggest that current approaches for expanding Brazilian sugarcane \n\nproduction by converting degraded pasture land to cropland can be a sustainable strategy for \n\nmeeting increasing biofuel demand. However, management practices that alleviate negative \n\nimpacts on soil physical and biological indicators must be prioritized within sugarcane \n\nproducing areas to prevent unintentional SQ degradation over time.  \n\n \n\nKeywords: Land-use change; Ethanol production; Minimum dataset; Soil quality indexes \n\n \n\n7.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nIncreasing global demand for biofuel has accelerated land-use change (LUC) to \n\nsupport bioenergy crops in many countries. In Brazil, the area devoted to sugarcane \n\nproduction increased from 5.8 to 9.0 Mha during the last decade (COMPANHIA NACIONAL \n\nDE ABASTECIMENTO, 2016). Even though Brazil is already the world\u2019s largest sugarcane \n\nproducer, current predictions indicate that an additional 6.4 Mha of sugarcane will be needed \n\nto meet the domestic demand for ethanol by 2021 (GODEMBERG et al., 2014). Sugarcane \n\nexpansion has primarily occurred on land previously occupied by extensive pastures \n\n(LAPOLA et al., 2010; GODEMBERG et al., 2014), most of which are degraded or in the \n\nprocess of being degraded (DIAS-FILHO, 2014; STRASSBURG et al., 2014). To obtain \n\n\n\n 162 \n\nlong-term energy security, bioenergy systems will need to be agronomically and \n\nenvironmentally sustainable. Intensification of land use through mechanization and \n\nagrochemical inputs has direct implications on soil physical, chemical and biological \n\nproperties and consequently on the quality/health of soils. To prevent unintended \n\nconsequences, monitoring of soil property changes due to LUC is essential (FU et al., 2015; \n\nZORNOZA et al., 2015). However, this research topic is still new in Brazil, and we are not \n\naware of any protocol for evaluating soil quality (SQ) changes induced by sugarcane \n\nexpansion in this region. \n\nSoil quality was defined as the capacity of a specific kind of soil to function, within \n\nnatural or managed ecosystem boundaries, to sustain plant and animal productivity, maintain \n\nor enhance water and air quality, and support human health and habitation (KARLEN et al., \n\n1997). It is a complex functional concept and cannot be measured directly in the field or \n\nlaboratory; but can be indirectly inferred by soil indicators (KARLEN et al., 1997; \n\nMUKHERJEE; LAL, 2014). Indicators of SQ are those measurable soil properties and \n\nprocesses that have greatest sensitivity to changes in soil function and its ecosystem services \n\n(ANDREWS; KARLEN; CAMBARDELLA, 2004; ZORNOZA et al., 2015). A wide range \n\nof soil chemical, physical and biological properties could be measured (CARDOSO et al., \n\n2013; ZORNOZA et al., 2015), but due to cost it\u2019s not feasible to consider them all, and \n\ntherefore it is necessary to select a minimum dataset (MDS). Several strategies have been \n\nused to define an appropriate MDS including principal component analysis (PCA) (LIMA; \n\nHOOGMOED; BRUSSAARD, 2008; ARMENISE et al., 2013; CHEN et al., 2013; ASKARI; \n\nHOLDEN, 2014; 2015; MUKHERJEE; LAL, 2014; S\u00c1NCHEZ-NAVARRO et al., 2015), \n\nfuzzy sets (QI et al., 2009; XIA et al., 2015), expert opinion (ANDREWS; KARLEN; \n\nMITCHELL, 2002; ANDREWS; KARLEN; CAMBARDELLA, 2004) and farmer/local \n\nknowledge (LIMA; HOOGMOED; BRUSSAARD, 2011; TESFAHUNEGN; TAMENE; \n\nVLEK, 2011). According Doran and Parkin (1994) suitable SQ indicators should correlate \n\nwell with ecosystem processes, integrate soil properties and processes, be accessible to many \n\nusers, sensitive to management and climate, and, whenever possible, be components of \n\nexisting databases. An example for reducing the number of potential SQ indicators was \n\nprovided by Andrews, Karlen and Cambardella (2004) through their development of the Soil \n\nManagement Assessment Framework (SMAF). Starting with an extensive list of 80 or more \n\nintegrative measurements related to ecosystem processes and functions that reflect SQ, they \n\ndeveloped scoring curves only for a small number (i.e., 10) of carefully selected indicators \n\nthat could reliably detect SQ changes induced by agricultural management practices. In more \n\n\n\n 163 \n\nrecent studies, others have shown that small datasets can effectively characterize SQ within \n\ndifferent ecosystems. Lima et al. (2013) compared SQ assessment using a total dataset (TDS) \n\nof 29 indicators, a MDS of eight indicators based on PCA, and an indigenous set of four \n\nindicators based on farmer knowledge to evaluate rice (Oryza sativa L.) production systems in \n\nsouthern Brazil. They concluded that the TDS provided the best assessment of SQ, but the \n\nsmaller datasets showed the same SQ trends and thus provided meaningful information for \n\nland managers. Askari and Holden (2014; 2015) reduced the number of indicators using PCA \n\nfrom 21 to 3 and from 22 to 7, respectively, and verified that the MDS indicators were \n\nsuitable to efficiently quantify SQ in grassland and arable fields in Ireland. \n\nAfter defining a MDS, linear and non-linear techniques, each with their advantages \n\nand disadvantages, have been applied to interpret SQ indicators (ANDREWS et al., 2002; \n\nMASTO et al., 2008; ASKARI and HOLDEN, 2014, 2015). While linear methods are simple, \n\nuser-friendly and require little knowledge of the indicator thresholds, non-linear methods can \n\nmore often assign meaningful scores that better represent the soil functions being represented \n\nby the indicators (ANDREWS; KARLEN; MITCHELL, 2002) \n\n Once individual indicators have been scored, it is often convenient, but not essential, \n\nto integrate them into an overall SQ index (SQI) that can be used to support decision making \n\nand selection of sustainable management practices (de PAUL OBADE; LAL, 2016). \n\nCurrently, there is no comprehensive, universal SQI that can be used across multiple natural \n\nand anthropogenic ecosystems. Many indexing strategies have been developed and tested for \n\nspecific purposes under particular environmental conditions around the world [e.g., in the \n\nU.S.A. (ANDREWS; KARLEN; MITCHELL, 2002; ANDREWS; KARLEN; \n\nCAMBARDELLA, 2004; MUKHERJEE; LAL, 2014; de PAUL OBADE; LAL, 2016), \n\nBrazil (LIMA et al., 2013), Argentina (ROMANIUK et al., 2011), Italy (ARMENISE et al., \n\n2013), Spain (S\u00c1NCHEZ-NAVARRO et al., 2015), Ireland (ASKARI; HOLDEN, 2014; \n\n2015), South Africa (SWANEPOEL et al., 2015), India (MASTO et al., 2008) and China (QI \n\net al., 2009; CHEN et al., 2013; LIU et al., 2015)]. The most user-friendly method to calculate \n\na SQI is to simply add all indicator scores and then divide by the number of indicators \n\n(ANDREWS; KARLEN; MITCHELL, 2002; ANDREWS; KARLEN; CAMBARDELLA, \n\n2004; KARLEN et al., 2013; MUKHERJEE; LAL, 2014). The major concern regarding this \n\nmethod is that when the number of indicators is unbalanced among chemical, physical and \n\nbiological sectors, the overall SQI misrepresents the sector(s) having fewer indicators. On the \n\nother hand, several studies have used methods that assign weights for each indicator. Different \n\ncriteria that have been used include soil function frameworks (KARLEN; STOTT, 1994; \n\n\n\n 164 \n\nLIMA et al., 2013; MUKHERJEE; LAL, 2014), principal components loading (ANDREWS; \n\nKARLEN; MITCHELL, 2002; MASTO et al., 2008; MUKHERJEE; LAL, 2014; LIU et al., \n\n2015; S\u00c1NCHEZ-NAVARRO et al., 2015), partial least squares regression coefficients (de \n\nPAUL OBADE; LAL, 2016) and correlation with crop yield (NAKAJIMA; LAL; JIANG, \n\n2015). Simple and weighted additive SQ indexing strategies provide site-specific responses \n\n(ANDREWS; KARLEN; MITCHELL, 2002; ASKARI; HOLDEN, 2014; 2015; \n\nMUKHERJEE; LAL, 2014), influenced by existing dataset, soil type, and effects of land use \n\nand management practices.  \n\n Developing more user-friendly and cost-effective strategies for assessing SQ changes \n\ninduced by agricultural management practices, especially those associated to bioenergy \n\nfeedstock production therefore remains a challenge for the scientific community \n\n(ANDREWS; KARLEN; MITCHELL, 2002;  MUKHERJEE; LAL, 2014; de PAUL \n\nOBADE; LAL, 2016). Our goal was to develop a sensitive and reliable protocol for \n\nevaluating SQ impact associated with LUC occurring to increase Brazilian sugarcane \n\nproduction. To do so, we conducted a field-study at three sites where the primary LUC \n\nsequence (i.e., native vegetation to pasture to sugarcane) is occurring within of the largest \n\nsugarcane-producing region of Brazil. Six SQ indexing strategies with varying complexity \n\nwere developed and tested. Our hypotheses were that: (i) the LUC sequence would result in \n\nSQ degradation; (ii) the SQI approach would be suitable to detect SQ changes due to LUC; \n\nand (iii) the simple, more user-friendly strategies would be able to detect SQ changes as \n\neffectively as more complex strategies. \n\n \n\n7.2 Material and Methods \n\n \n\n7.2.1 Study sites and experimental design  \n\n \n\nThe study sites and experimental design were described in the 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 items. \n\n \n\n7.2.2 Soil sampling and analyses \n\n \n\nAll soil samples were collected using a consistent experimental design that had four \n\npoints spaced 50 m apart imposed within each land use. This provided 12 sampling points for \n\neach location or 36 sampling points for the three locations. A small trench (30 x 30 x 30 cm) \n\nwas opened at each sampling point to collect both undisturbed and semi-undisturbed samples \n\n\n\n 165 \n\nfrom the 0 to 10-, 10 to 20- and 20 to 30-cm layers. This provided 108 samples for physical \n\nanalyses, and 108 for soil aggregation and macrofauna analyses. An additional 108 disturbed \n\nsamples were collected for chemical and biological analyses by compositing 12 subsamples \n\ntaken from each soil layer with a Dutch auger.  \n\nAvailable phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S \u2013 \n\nsulphate), boron (B), cooper (Cu), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), active acidity \n\n(pHCaCl2 0.01mol L\n-1\n\n), potential acidity (H+Al), base saturation (BS) and cation exchange \n\ncapacity (CECpH7) were determined using analytical methods described by Raij et al. (2001). \n\nSoil resistance to penetration (SRP) and field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kfs) were \n\nmeasured at five and three locations, respectively, within ~5 m of each trench using a digital \n\npenetrometer (PenetroLOG\u00ae) and the \u2018simplified falling-head\u2019 method proposed by \n\nBagarello, Iovino and Elrick (2004). Soil structural quality of the 20 x 10 x 25 cm monoliths \n\nfrom each trench was assessed using the Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure (VESS) method \n\n(BALL; BATEY; MUNKHOLM, 2007; GUIMAR\u00c3ES; BALL; TORMENA, 2011). Particle-\n\nsize was determined using the hydrometer method. Bulk density (BD) was determined based \n\non the core method with 100 cm\n-3\n\ncylinder. Soil degree of compactness (SDC) was calculated \n\nas SDC = [(BD/BDmax) x 100], where BDmax is maximum bulk density, estimated using a \n\npedotransfer function described by Marcolin and Klein et al. (2011). The total porosity (TP) \n\nwas calculated as TP = 1 - (BD/PD), where, PD is particle density, determined using a gas \n\npycnometer. Soil water content at -6 kPa and -10 kPa water potential was determined using \n\ntension tables as described by Ball and Hunter (1988). Soil macroporosity (MaP) was \n\ncomputed as the difference between soil water content at saturation and at -6 kPa. Soil \n\nmicroporosity (MiP) was estimated as the soil water content at the -6 kPa. Water-filled pore \n\nspace (WFPS) was calculated by dividing volumetric moisture at -6 kPa by total porosity as \n\nindicated in Wienhold et al. (2009). We also calculated two indexes suggested by Reynolds et \n\nal. (2002): i) soil water storage capacity (SWSC) defined as the ratio between water content at \n\nfield capacity (FC, -10 kPa soil water potential) and TP (SWSC = FC/TP); and ii) soil \n\naeration capacity (SAC) calculated as the ratio between drained pores at soil water potential \n\nof -10 kPa (ACt) and TP (SAC = ACt/TP). A structural stability index (SSI) was calculated as \n\nsuggested by Reynolds et al. (2009): SSI = [(SOC x 1.724) / (silt + clay)]*100. Wet \n\nmacroaggregate stability (AGS) was determined using a vertical oscillator (Yoder, model \n\nMA-148) with three sieves (2000, 250, and 53 ?m) moving at a speed of 30 oscillations per \n\nmin for 10 min. Percentage of macroaggregates  was calculated by summing aggregate mass \n\nfor >2000 and 250 ?m classes, dividing by the total soil mass, and multiplying by 100. Mean \n\n\n\n 166 \n\nweight diameter (MWD) was calculated as the sum of the proportion of aggregates in each \n\nsize fraction, with each proportion weighted by the mean diameter of aggregates in that size \n\nfraction. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) were determined by dry \n\ncombustion on a LECO\u00ae CN-2000 elemental analyzer (furnace at 1350 \u00baC in pure oxygen). \n\nCarbon and nitrogen within microbial biomass (MBC and MBN) were measured by \n\nfumigation/extraction as proposed by Vance, Brookes and Jenkinson (1987). Enzymatic \n\nactivities of ?-Glucosidase (BG) and acid phosphatase (AcP) were measured as described by \n\nTabatabai (1994). Immediately after the sampling, soil macrofauna were carefully hand-sorted \n\nfrom each 25 x 25 x 30 cm soil block, according to the standard Tropical Soil Biology and \n\nFertility Institute (TSBF) soil monolith method (ANDERSON; INGRAM, 1993). \n\nInvertebrates were classified into the taxonomic groups: Aranae, Blattodea, Chilopoda, \n\nColeoptera, Dermaptera, Diplopoda, Diptera, Formicidae, others Hymenoptera, Gastropoda, \n\nHemiptera, Isopoda, Isoptera, Oligochaeta, and Scorpiones. Macrofauna density was \n\ndetermined as the number of individuals per surface unit (m\n2\n). Ecological indexes were \n\ncalculated for assessing richness (Margalef\u2019s index) and diversity (Shannon\u2019s index), \n\naccording to the methods described by Magurran (2004). \n\n \n\n7.2.3 Developing the soil quality indexes \n\n \n\nSix SQI values were developed using different approaches (Figure 1), although each \n\ninvolved three common steps: selection of SQ indicators as an MDS, transformation of \n\nindicator values into unitless 0 to 1 scores using scoring curves, and integration into an overall \n\nindex (KARLEN; DITZLER; ANDREWS, 2003). The SQIs were compared to identify the \n\nmost appropriate strategy for assessing SQ changes induced by LUC associated with \n\nsugarcane expansion in Brazil. Soil data from the 0 to 10-, 10 to 20- and 20 to 30-cm layers \n\nwere averaged to create a 0 to 30-cm layer that was then used to calculate an overall SQI that \n\nbetter represented the whole soil profile. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 167 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - Process diagram for the development of soil quality indexes tested in this study \n\n \n\n(a) Step 1- Indicator selection \n\nThree indicator selection approaches were evaluated: (i) the Total Dataset (TDS) \n\nwhich included 38 indicators representing 14 chemical, 14 physical and 10 biological \n\nproperties and processes; (ii) a MDS-PCA created using PCA on the TDS to reduce data \n\nredundancy and identify the most efficient indicators, without depending upon subjective, \n\nexpert opinion or literature values; and (iii) a five indicator MDS-EO chosen based on expert \n\nopinion and literature review. For the MDS-PCA, only seven components with eigenvalues \n\n>1 (Kaiser\u2019s criteria) were retained and subjected to varimax rotation to enhance the \n\ninterpretability of the components (Figure 2). Furthermore, for each component, only the \n\nindicators with loading values within 10% of the highest value were retained (ANDREWS; \n\nKARLEN; MITCHELL, 2002; CHEN et al., 2013; ASKARI; HOLDEN, 2014; 2015; LIU et \n\nal., 2015). When more than one indicator was retained, correlation values among them were \n\nanalyzed. If the indicators were significantly correlated (p<0.01), only the one with the \n\nhighest loading factor was retained in the MDS to avoid redundancy (ANDREWS; KARLEN; \n\nMITCHELL, 2002; CHEN et al., 2013; MUKHERJEE; LAL, 2014). The MDS-EO was \n\nselected taking into account the indicator\u2019s ability to detect soil function changes as well as \n\nthe ease, practicality and cost-effectiveness for sampling, analysis and interpretation.  \n\n \n\nTotal Dataset \n\n(TDS) \n\nPrincipal Component \n\nAnalysis (MDS-PCA) \n\nExpert Opinion \n\n(MDS-EO) \n\nNon-linear Non-linear Non-linear \n\nSimple \n\nadditive \n\nWeighted \n\nAdditive \n\u201cSoil functions\u201d \n\nSimple \n\nadditive \n\nWeighted \n\nAdditive \n\u201cPCA loading\u201d \n\nSimple \n\nadditive \n\nWeighted \n\nAdditive \n\u201cSectors\u201d \n\nSteps \n\nIndicator \n\nselection \n\nIndicator \n\nInterpretation \n\nIndicator \n\nIntegration \n\nIndex SQI-1 SQI-2 SQI-3 SQI-4 SQI-5 SQI-6 \n\n\n\n 168 \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2 - Scree plot of principal component analysis \n\n \n\n(b) Step 2- Indicator interpretation \n\nAll measured indicator values were transformed using non-linear scoring functions. \n\nBased on agronomic and environmental soil functions, each indicator was scored using one of \n\nthe following curves: \u201cmore is better\u201d (upper asymptote sigmoid curve), \u201cless in better\u201d \n\n(lower asymptote sigmoid curve), and \u201cmid-point optimum\u201d (Gaussian curve), as exemplified \n\nin Figure 3.

For the TDS, the indicators were weighted according to a \n\nframework developed based on five soil functions (Table 2), as suggested by Karlen and Stott \n\n(1994) and later used by Lima et al. (2013). Step by step procedure used for calculate the SQI-\n\n2 is shown in the Table 2. For the MDS-PCA, the indicators were weighted according with \n\nproportional variation explained by each principal component (i.e., % variance explained by \n\neach component divided by total cumulative variance of all components selected for the \n\nMDS). For the MDS-EO the indicators were weighted by chemical, physical and biological \n\nsectors, in which each one, regardless of number of indicators, had the same weight (33%) in \n\nthe final index.  \n\n \n\nSensitivity of SQ indexing strategies \n\n The sensitivity of the SQ indexing strategies for detecting LUC impacts on SQ was \n\ncalculated using equation 5, described by Masto et al.

All statistical procedures \n\nwere completed using Statistical Analysis System \u2013 SAS v.9.3 (SAS Inc, Cary, USA). \n\n \n\n7.3 Results and Discussion \n\n \n\n7.3.1 Soil quality indicators \n\n \n\nLand-use change effects on the 38 soil quality indicators at each site are presented in \n\nTable 3. As typically reported for tropical soils, native vegetation sites were characterized by \n\nhigh acidity, low levels of soil organic matter (SOM) and plant-available macronutrients, \n\nsuitable soil physical conditions, and high activity as well as diversity of edaphic fauna. Long-\n\nterm conversion from native vegetation to extensive pasture significantly increased soil \n\nacidification (i.e., decreased pH and increased H+Al concentrations), depleted SOM (SOC \n\nand TN), available macronutrients, B and CTCpH7 and, increased micronutrient (Cu, Fe, Mn \n\nand Zn) availability. Poor long-term management, which typically includes continuous \n\ngrazing without liming and/or applying fertilizer over time (DIAS-FILHO, 2014; \n\nSTRASSBURG et al., 2014), is a major factor for SOC and nutrient depletion within \n\nBrazilian pastures. Conversion from native vegetation to pasture also degraded soil physical \n\nproperties. Continuous cattle trampling coupled with SOC depletion, increased soil \n\ncompaction (i.e., higher BD and SDC) and altered pore size and distribution (i.e., lower MaP \n\nand higher MiP). This subsequently reduced soil aeration (SAC), significantly decreased Kfs \n\nand available water, and may restrict root growth (i.e., higher SRP and VESS scores). Despite \n\nthose changes, soil aggregate stability (AGS and MWD) was not affected by pasture \n\nestablishment. Soil compaction and consequently physical degradation of pasturelands are \n\nwell documented in the literature (e.g., GREENWOOD; McKENZIE, 2001; PIETOLA; \n\nHORN; YLI-HALLA, 2005; HUNKE et al., 2015).  \n\n\n\n 174 \n\nTable 3 - Mean values of the 38 soil indicators (0-30 cm depth) in native vegetation (NV), \n\npasture (PA) and sugarcane (SC) at three sites in central-southern Brazil  \n\nIndicator\n\u00a7\n \n\nLat_17S Lat_21S Lat_23S \n\nNV PA SC NV PA SC NV PA SC \n\nChemical \nP (mg dm-3) 4.5 b* 2.6 c 6.7 a 12.9 a 5.1 b 9.8 a 14.5 a 10.9 ab 7.6 b \nS (mg dm-3) 4.1 b 3.6 b 17.3 a 8.6 a 9.1 a 7.7 a 16.4 a 10.6 b 6.0 b \nK (mmolc dm\n\n-3\n) 0.8 a 0.5 b 0.4 b 2.7 a 3.1 a 2.5 a 3.0 b 4.4 a 2.0 b \n\nCa (mmolc dm\n-3\n\n) 3.0 b 2.7 b 20.0 a 69.4 a 7.1 c 29.1 b 19.1 b 31.1 b 49.8  a \nMg (mmolc dm\n\n-3\n) 2.4 b 1.3 b 8.7 a 17.6 a 4.1 c 13.0 b 9.9 b 17.8 ab 19.6 a \n\nB (mg dm-3) 0.2 a 0.1 b 0.1 b 0.5 a 0.2 c 0.4 b 0.6 a 0.3 b 0.3 b \nCu (mg dm-3) 3.1 a 0.7 b 3.2 a 0.8 b  1.2 a 1.0 b 1.6 b 2.3 a 1.2 c \nFe (mg dm-3) 43.6 b 85.6 a 20.8 b 15.0 c 164.8 a 51.4 b 87.5 a 90.3 a 21.6 b \nMn (mg dm-3) 9.7 a 3.6 b 4.9 b 32.6 a 14.3 b 16.5 b 45.5 b 100.5 a 14.7 c \nZn (mg dm-3) 0.5 a 0.3 a  0.4 a  2.2 a 1.3 b 1.4 b 2.4 b  4.1 a 0.8 b \nCECpH7  (mmolc dm\n\n-3\n) 78.6 a 54.3 b 60.3 b 104.6 a 60.9 c 71.0 b 169.5 a 103.0 b 105.2 b \n\nH+Al (mmolc dm\n-3\n\n) 72.4 a 49.7 b 31.2 c 14.9 c 46.6 a 26.5 b 137.6 a 49.8 b 33.8 b \npHCaCl2  (unitless) 3.7 b 3.7 b 5.0 a 6.1 a 3.9 c 5.0 b 3.8 c 4.6 b 5.4 a \nBS (%) 7.9 b 8.6 b 48.2 a 85.5 a 23.6 c 62.1 b 19.6 b 51.5 a 67.1 a \n\nPhysical \n\nBD (Mg m-3) 1.3 c 1.6 a 1.5 b 1.3 b 1.6 a 1.7 a 1.0 b 1.3 a 1.4 a \nSDC (%) 73.8 b 87.7 a 89.8 a 70.9 b 89.3 a 89.3 a 79.6 b 95.4 a 98.3 a \nSRP (MPa) 1.1 c 1.9 a 1.5 b 0.6 c 2.8 a 1.9 b 2.4 a 2.4 a 2.2 a \nMaP (m3 m-3) 0.26 a 0.16 b 0.12 b 0.22 a 0.06 b 0.05 b 0.21 a 0.03 b 0.05 b \nMiP (m3 m-3) 0.29 b 0.23 c 0.34 a 0.29 b 0.32 a 0.32 a 0.40 c 0.48 a 0.44 b \nTP (m3 m-3) 0.55 a 0.39 c 0.46 b 0.51 a 0.39 b 0.38 b 0.61 a 0.51 b 0.49 b \nWFPS (unitless) 0.40 b 0.37 b 0.62 a 0.37 b 0.54 a 0.63 a 0.48 b 0.87 a 0.81 a \nSWSC (unitless) 0.47 b 0.49 b 0.69 a 0.41 b 0.71 a 0.72 a 0.61 b 0.93 a 0.88 a \nSAC (unitless) 0.53 a 0.51 a 0.31 b 0.59 a 0.29 b 0.28 b 0.39 a 0.07 b 0.12 b \nKfs (cm h\n\n-1\n) 130 b 48 b 358 a 129 a 3 b 4 b 46.9 a 1.7 b 0.9 b \n\nAGS (%) 90.0 a 92.7 a 79.2 b 80.5 a 84.5 a 66.7 b 93.7 b 96.7 a 87.0 c \nMWD (mm) 3.3 b 4.0 a 1.4 c 4.4 a 4.2 a 3.4 b 4.1 b 4.7 a 2.6 c \nVESS (score) 1.8 b 2.0 b 2.5 a 1.8 c 2.9 b 3.7 a 2.5 b 3.2 a 3.3 a \nSSI (%) 5.7 b 9.1 a 4.6 c 11.2 a 7.2 b  6.9 b 7.4 a 6.6 b 4.5 c \n\nBiological \n\nSOC (g kg-1) 13.1 a 8.8 c 11.0 b 16.3 a 10.2 b 9.4 b 35.5 a 30.5 b 19.5 c \nTN (g kg-1) 1.0 a 0.5 b 0.9 a 1.7 a 0.9 b 1.0 b 3.1 a 2.3 b 1.5 c \nMBC (mg kg-1) 421.9 a 396.0 a 375.6 a 841.2 a 450.1 b 559.3 b 2049.5a 2238.2 a 1024.3 b \nMBN (mg kg-1) 41.0 a 22.6 b 17.0 b 75.7 a 30.1 b 21.7 b 98.4 b 161.9 a 43.3 c \nBG (mg kg-1 h-1) 50.5 a 39.8 a 47.1 a 108.2 c 270.0 a 206.2 b 384.2 a 120.8 b 53.4 b \nAcP (mg kg-1 h-1) 204.5 a 154.2 b 138.2 b 151.6 b 256.2 a 229.4 a 324.3 a 326.2 a 167.8 b \nEworm (indiv m-2) 8 a 4 a 4 a 20 b 248 a 36 b 12 b 60 a 4 b \nMDens (indiv m-2) 120 b 1428 a 40 b 664 a 772 a 148 b 516 a 888 a 72 b \nMRich (unitless) 0.4 a 0.2 a 0.3 a 0.9 a 0.5 a 0.4 a 0.6 a 0.4 ab 0.2 b \nMDiver (unitless) 0.8 a 0.3 b 0.6 a 1.2 a 1.1 a 0.8 a 1.1 a 0.7 b 0.5 b \n\n*Mean values within each site followed by the same letter do not differ among themselves according to Tukey\u2019s test \n\n(p<0.05). \n\u00a7\nAbbreviations are same as Table 1. \n\n \n\nSoil biological changes were also observed due to conversion from native vegetation \n\nto pasture. Most biological indicators showed site-specific responses, although MBC and \n\nMBN tended to be lower within pasture soils, especially at the Lat_17S and Lat_21S sites. \n\nEnzyme activities (BG and AcP) showed a decreasing trend under pasture at Lat_17S and \n\nLat_23S, but increased significantly at Lat_21S. Variation in soil acidity, SOC, P availability, \n\nmicrobiological activity and other variables not assessed in this study, may be among the \n\n\n\n 175 \n\ncontrolling factors affecting enzyme responses at the various sites. Pastures soils generally \n\nhad a higher density of macrofauna than native vegetation sites, but the increase was \n\ndominated by a few taxonomic groups such termites (mainly at Lat_17S), ants, coleopterans \n\nand earthworms. Conversely, even though native vegetation samples had lower macrofauna \n\npopulations, they had a higher richness and diversity of species. Our findings are consistent \n\nwith others in the literature (BENITO et al., 2004; DECAENS et al., 2004), which generally \n\nstate that macrofaunal community size in tropical soils tends to increase over time following \n\nconversion from native vegetation to pasture.  \n\n The LUC from pasture to sugarcane improved soil chemical quality. Liming and \n\nannual application of fertilizer (organic and/or mineral) reduced soil acidity and increased \n\nmacronutrient availability. Short-term sugarcane establishment (<5 years) had no negative \n\nimpacts on SOC and TN content at Lat_17S and Lat_21S, but as reported by Mello et al. \n\n(2014) and Franco et al. (2015), SOC and TN were depleted after more than 20 years \n\n(Lat_23S) of sugarcane cultivation. Those decreases presumably are associated with the \n\nintensive tillage performed every five years (SILVA-OLAYA et al., 2013; MELLO et al., \n\n2014) and more than 10 years of pre-harvest burning, which has been shown to deplete SOC \n\nover time (CERRI et al., 2011).  \n\n Conversion from pasture to sugarcane also negatively impacted on soil physical \n\nindicators, primarily those related to soil structure, such as AGS, MWD, VESS and SSI. \n\nAlthough tillage in preparation for sugarcane replanting (Lat_17S) alleviated soil compaction \n\n(i.e., decreased BD and SRP; increased Kfs), our data suggest those positive effects have \n\nshort-term persistence (i.e., primarily the first year, as reported by Centurion et al. (2007). \n\nOver the entire sugarcane cycle, intensive machinery traffic increases soil compaction again, \n\nleading to decreased of aeration, infiltration and water availability as observed at Lat_21S and \n\nLat_23S. Short-term positive tillage effects on soil physical quality are most likely associated \n\nwith SOC depletion, due to disruption of macroaggregates and exposure of physically and \n\nchemically protected C to microbial decomposition (SIX; ELLIOTT; PAUSTIAN, 2000), and \n\nthe subsequent deleterious consequences on soil structure. In addition, several studies have \n\nshown that intensive machinery traffic in sugarcane fields has negative impacts on soil \n\nphysical quality and often decreases sugarcane growth and yield (e.g., OTTO et al., 2011; \n\nSOUZA et al., 2014). Adverse impacts of current sugarcane management practices on soil \n\nphysical and structural properties have also markedly increased soil loss and degradation by \n\nerosion when compared with native vegetation or pasture (WEILL; SPAROVEK, 2008), \n\n\n\n 176 \n\nbecoming one of major concern for a sustainable sugarcane production in Brazil \n\n(MARTINELLI; FILOSO, 2007).  \n\nOverall, LUC from pasture to sugarcane also has negative implications on soil \n\nbiological indicators. Depletions of soil biota in sugarcane fields can be associated with \n\nquantitative and qualitative decreases in SOC. Franco et al. (2015) reported that sugarcane \n\nproduction depletes C input from C3 plants (forest) which is preferable by microorganisms, \n\nand that new C from C4 plants (i.e., pasture and sugarcane) was insufficient to offset those \n\nlosses. Furthermore, intensification of land use and management, that includes considerable \n\nmineral fertilizer and pesticides inputs as well as the modification or destruction of native \n\nbiological habitats by tillage, and soil compaction can led to a reduction or simplification in \n\nsoil diversity and its ecosystem functions in sugarcane fields, as reported by Wagg et al. \n\n(2014).  \n\n \n\n7.3.2 Soil quality indexing \n\n \n\nThe three SQ indicator selection approaches (Figure 1) provided different datasets for \n\nindex calculations. The TDS (38 indicators) provided a wide range of soil indicators and \n\ntheoretically should have resulted in a more accurate (sensitive) assessment of SQ, due to the \n\nvery comprehensive evaluation involving chemical, physical and biological soil properties \n\nand their interactions. The primary limitations of the TDS approach are the high cost, greater \n\namount of time required for sampling and laboratory analyses, redundancy of indicators, and \n\nmore complex data interpretation (QI et al., 2009; LIMA et al., 2013; ASKARI; HOLDEN, \n\n2014). Using a PCA reduced the TDS to seven principal components (MDS-PCA) that \n\nexplained approximately 90% of total variance (Figure 2 and Table 4). Only the indicator with \n\nhighest loading factor within each PC was retained for the MDS-PCA, since the other highly \n\nweighted indicators were well-correlated (r>0.85; p<0.01) among themselves (Table 5). The \n\nseven selected indicators were: SOC, SAC, pH, Kfs, Mdiver, BG and Mdens. Selecting SQ \n\nindicators using PCA has some advantages and disadvantages. According to Andrews, Karlen \n\nand Mitchell (2002) or Mukherjee and Lal (2014) PCA provides a less subjective method of \n\nindicator selection, which can help avoid bias and data redundancy. On the other hand, the \n\nPCA method requires a large dataset and is less \u201cuser friendly,\u201d thus imposing barriers to \n\npractical adoption for farm or regional scale SQ assessments. Furthermore, the selected \n\nindicators may not be meaningful for farmers and land managers (ANDREWS; KARLEN; \n\nMITCHELL, 2002). \n\n\n\n 177 \n\nTable 4 - Result of principal component analysis \n\n Principal Components \n\n  PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 PC5 PC6 PC7 \n Eigenvalues  10.33 7.92 5.76 3.17 2.53 2.31 2.19 \n\n Variance (%) 27.19 20.84 15.15 8.35 6.67 6.08 5.75 \n\n Cumulative (%) 27.19 48.03 63.18 71.53 78.20 84.27 90.03 \n\n Soil Indicators Eigenvectors\n\u2021\n Communalities \n\nP 0.685 -0.035 0.482 -0.018 0.122 0.421 0.076 0.901 \n\nS 0.319 0.166 0.009 0.656 0.147 0.508 0.179 0.871 \n\nK 0.553 0.395 0.194 -0.369 0.424 0.061 0.198 0.859 \n\nCa 0.243 -0.008 0.930 -0.132 0.035 0.044 -0.049 0.947 \n\nMg 0.407 0.343 0.797 -0.086 -0.037 0.027 -0.066 0.933 \n\nB 0.610 -0.216 0.387 -0.248 0.130 0.517 -0.094 0.922 \n\nCu 0.170 0.047 -0.251 0.799 0.023 -0.328 -0.222 0.890 \n\nFe 0.030 0.257 -0.660 -0.329 0.269 0.106 0.416 0.867 \n\nMn 0.815 0.296 0.111 -0.060 0.204 -0.222 0.285 0.940 \n\nZn 0.736 0.198 0.199 -0.103 0.296 -0.080 0.328 0.833 \n\nCEC 0.849 -0.114 0.076 -0.061 0.007 0.418 -0.183 0.951 \n\nH+Al 0.580 -0.190 -0.656 0.052 -0.023 0.374 -0.144 0.967 \n\npH -0.046 0.063 0.981 0.048 0.032 -0.028 -0.053 0.976 \n\nBS 0.042 0.202 0.966 -0.028 0.099 0.031 -0.027 0.987 \n\n         BD -0.832 0.375 -0.009 -0.167 -0.049 -0.065 0.286 0.950 \n\nSDC -0.131 0.900 -0.008 -0.040 -0.237 -0.080 0.054 0.895 \n\nRP 0.123 0.727 -0.408 -0.244 -0.051 0.213 0.158 0.843 \n\nMaP 0.187 -0.932 -0.147 0.144 -0.024 0.025 -0.179 0.980 \n\nMiP 0.641 0.702 0.163 0.114 0.029 0.002 -0.143 0.964 \n\nTP 0.817 -0.326 -0.016 0.249 0.019 0.035 -0.350 0.960 \n\nWFPS 0.215 0.899 0.230 0.108 -0.022 -0.156 -0.097 0.954 \n\nSWSC 0.184 0.964 0.073 0.051 -0.031 -0.037 -0.041 0.975 \n\nSAC -0.184 -0.964 -0.073 -0.051 0.031 0.037 0.041 0.975 \n\nKfs -0.214 -0.302 0.141 0.858 -0.037 -0.067 -0.040 0.901 \n\nAGS 0.607 -0.060 -0.477 -0.080 -0.235 -0.388 0.085 0.820 \n\nMWD 0.448 -0.150 -0.097 -0.667 0.309 -0.119 0.383 0.934 \n\nVESS -0.011 0.832 0.111 -0.115 -0.039 0.322 0.010 0.823 \n\nSSI 0.082 -0.586 0.227 -0.477 0.170 0.061 0.511 0.922 \n\nSOC 0.963 0.150 -0.031 0.001 0.016 0.134 -0.052 0.972 \n\nTN 0.929 0.063 0.055 -0.032 0.114 0.277 -0.056 0.963 \n\nMBC 0.903 0.279 0.019 -0.087 -0.002 0.086 0.085 0.916 \n\nMBN 0.866 0.160 0.082 -0.089 0.086 -0.209 0.202 0.883 \n\nBG 0.367 0.099 -0.274 -0.210 0.342 0.729 0.125 0.928 \n\nAcP 0.629 0.340 -0.402 -0.169 0.391 0.172 0.072 0.890 \n\nEworm -0.163 0.215 -0.235 -0.003 0.322 0.128 0.520 0.518 \n\nMdens 0.065 -0.136 -0.134 -0.156 -0.237 -0.013 0.746 0.678 \n\nMrich 0.236 -0.396 0.186 -0.075 0.749 0.079 0.034 0.822 \n\nMdiver 0.131 -0.184 -0.020 0.015 0.909 0.129 -0.089 0.903 \n\u2021\nBold values under each component were highly weighted (factor loading value within 10% of the highest values under the \n\nsame principal component) and underlined-bold values were selected to minimum data set;

As \n\nrecommended by Doran and Parkin (1994), these indicators are desirable for SQ assessments \n\nbecause they are: easy to sample for, readily available in commercial laboratories at a low \n\ncost, and the results can be easily interpreted using pre-defined thresholds. The fourth \n\nindicator, VESS score, provides an integrative assessment of soil structural/physical quality \n\nthrough an easily-performed, low-cost, direct on-farm method (BALL; BATEY; \n\nMUNKHOLM, 2007; GUIMAR\u00c3ES; BALL; TORMENA, 2011). VESS integrates soil \n\nproperties related to size, strength and porosity of aggregates, roots and soil color into a single \n\nscore, which ranges from 1 (good) to 5 (poor structural quality). The fifth indicator, SOC, is \n\nthe most consistent indicator used for SQ assessments (ZORNOZA et al., 2015), because it \n\ninfluences multiple soil and ecosystem functions (LAL, 2004). Furthermore, SOC can be \n\nanalyzed using the same sample collected for chemical indicators and it is routinely analyzed \n\nso most farmers have previous records for temporal comparisons. The MDS-EO approach was \n\nconsistent with Andrews, Karlen and Cambardella (2004) and Karlen et al. (2008), who \n\nrecommend that SQ assessments could be made using a minimum of five indicators provided \n\nthere was at least one each representing soil chemical, physical and biological properties and \n\nprocesses. However, Andrews, Karlen and Mitchell (2002) did warn that expert opinion \n\nmethod does truly require expert knowledge of the entire system and may be subject to \n\ndisciplinary biases. \n\nSoil quality indicators were individually scored (Equation 1 and 2) and then, \n\nintegrated using six strategies (Figure 1). The SQI scores for native vegetation, pasture and \n\nsugarcane (0-30 cm depth) at each site are shown in Figure 4. Overall, all six SQI approaches \n\nwere able to detect SQ changes induced by LUC. Soils from native vegetation sites had \n\nsignificantly greater SQI values, except at Lat_17S, where the soil was more weathered and \n\nconsequently had very poor chemical quality (CHERUBIN et al., 2015). In general, LUC \n\nfrom native vegetation to pasture significantly decreased SQ, although the sensitivity among \n\nthe SQ indexing strategies was slightly different. Conversion from pasture to sugarcane \n\npromoted site-specific SQ changes, leading to increases or decreases associated with inherent \n\nsoil characteristics and historic of land use and management. \n\n\n\n 181 \n\n \n \n\nFigure 4 - Soil Quality Index (SQI)\n\u00a7\n scores under native vegetation (NV), pasture (PA) and \n\nsugarcane (SC), for the 0-30 cm depth, at three sites in central-southern Brazil. \u00a7SQI \nstrategies: SQI-1: TDS/non-linear/simple additive, SQI-2: TDS/non-linear/weighted additive, SQI-3: \n\nMDS-PCA/non-linear/simple additive, SQI-4: MDS-PCA/non-linear/ weighted additive, SQI-5: MDS-EO \n\n/non-linear/simple additive, and SQI-6: MDS-EO /non-linear/weighted additive. *Mean values within \n\neach index followed by the same letter do not differ among themselves according to Tukey\u2019s test \n\n(p<0.05) \n\n \n\nab* ns \n\nb \nb \n\na \na \n\nb \n\nab \n\nb \nb \n\nb \n\na \n\na \na \n\na ab \n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1.0\n\nSQI-1 SQI-2 SQI-3 SQI-4 SQI-5 SQI-6\n\nS\nc\no\n\nr\ne\n \n\nNV\n\nPA\n\nSC\n\nLat_17S \n\na \na \n\na \n\na \n\na \na \n\nb \n\nb \nb \n\nb c b \n\nb \n\nb b \nb \n\nb \n\nb \n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1.0\n\nSQI-1 SQI-2 SQI-3 SQI-4 SQI-5 SQI-6\n\nS\nc\no\nr\ne\n \n\nLat_21S \n\na \n\na a a ns \na \n\nb \n\nb \n\nb b \n\nab \n\nc \n\nb \nc \n\nc \n\nb \n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1.0\n\nSQI-1 SQI-2 SQI-3 SQI-4 SQI-5 SQI-6\n\nS\nc\no\nr\ne\n \n\nSoil Quality Index \n\nLat_23S \n\n\n\n 182 \n\nAt Lat_17S, sugarcane cultivation increased SQ, primarily due to soil fertility \n\nimprovement through lime and fertilizer applications. This was confirmed by SQIs calculated \n\nusing strategies that gave greater weight to chemical indicators, such as SQI-4 and SQI-5. At \n\nLat_21S, conversion from pasture to sugarcane had essentially no influence on overall SQ, \n\nexcept when SQI-5 was used for the evaluation. In contrast, at Lat_23S, SQI-1, SQI-3 and \n\nSQI-4 indicated that long-term sugarcane cultivation significantly decreased SQ likely due to \n\nsignificant SOM depletion (FRANCO et al., 2015). This in turn had negative implications on \n\nmicro- and macro-faunal activity, cycling and availability of nutrients, and soil structure \n\n(Table 3). \n\nAt the regional scale, SQ changes induced by LUC for sugarcane expansion were \n\nconsistently detected by all six indexing strategies (Figure 5). In general, higher absolute SQI \n\nvalues were observed when using the TDS (SQI-1 and SQI-2) followed by the SQIs from \n\nMDS-EO (SQI-5 and SQI-6) and SQIs from MDS-PCA (SQI-3 and SQI-4). An identical \n\nsequence was verified by Lima et al. (2013). Native vegetation soils had the highest SQI \n\nscores, suggesting they are functioning at 56 to 78% of their potential capacity for the 0-30 \n\ncm depth. These results support the hypothesis that natural ecosystems are more balanced, \n\nbecause chemical, physical and biological attributes act collectively, thus enabling soils to \n\nperform their functions properly. The SQIs indicated that long-term conversion from native \n\nvegetation to extensive pasture decreased SQ indexes by 15 to 23% (Figure 5), resulting in \n\npasture soils that were functioning at between 44 to 66% of their potential capacity. Weighed \n\nindexes helped to clarify the reasons for overall SQ depletion within pasturelands. The SQI-2 \n\nscores (i.e., TDS weighted by soil function framework) indicated that pasture soils had \n\nreduced soil functions associated with storage and provision of water, as well as soil aeration \n\n(-32%), soil capacity to sustain plant growth (-18%), biological activity (-30%), ability to \n\nresist degradation (-22%), and although not statistically significant, the capacity for storage, \n\nprovision and cycling of nutrients (-6%) when compared to soils under native vegetation \n\n(Figure 6). The SQI-4, weighted by PCA loading, showed that SQ depletions in pasturelands \n\nwere mainly associated with significant decreases of SOC and Kfs (Figure 7A). Using only \n\nfive selected, but weighted soil indicators (SQI-6) detected that SQ depletion due to \n\nconversion from native vegetation to pasture was associated with significant decreases in soil \n\nchemical (-23%), physical (-17%) and biological sectors (-22%) (Figure 7B). This was in \n\nagreement with results obtained using SQI-2, which was the most complex strategy. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 183 \n\n  \n \n\n  \n \n\n  \n \n\nFigure 5 - Overall Soil Quality Index (SQI) scores under native vegetation (NV), pasture \n\n(PA) and sugarcane (SC), for the 0-30 cm depth, in central-southern Brazil. *Mean \nvalues within each index followed by the same letter do not differ among themselves according to \n\nTukey\u2019s test (p<0.05) \n\n \n\n \n\n0.78 a* \n\n0.66 b 0.66 b \n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nNV PA SC\n\nS\nQ\n\nI-\n1\n\n s\nc\no\n\nr\ne\n \n\nTDS/non-linear/simple \n\n0.73 a \n\n0.56 b 0.54 b \n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nNV PA SC\n\nS\nQ\n\nI-\n2\n\n s\nc\no\n\nr\ne\n \n\nNV\nPA\nSC\n\nTDS/non-linear/weighted additive \n\n0.63 a \n\n0.50 b 0.47 b \n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nNV PA SC\n\nS\nQ\n\nI-\n3\n s\n\nc\no\nr\ne\n \n\nMDS-PCA/non-linear/simple additive \n\n0.56 a \n\n0.44 b \n0.48 ab \n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nNV PA SC\n\nS\nQ\n\nI-\n4\n s\n\nc\no\nr\ne\n \n\nMDS-PCA/non-linear/weighted additive \n\n0.69 a \n\n0.54 b \n0.62 ab \n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nNV PA SC\n\nS\nQ\n\nI-\n5\n s\n\nc\no\nr\ne\n \n\nMDS-EO/non-linear/simple additive \n\n0.71a \n\n0.57 b 0.56 b \n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nNV PA SC\n\nS\nQ\n\nI-\n6\n s\n\nc\no\nr\ne\n \n\nMDS-EO/non-linear/weighted additive \n\n\n\n 184 \n\n \n \n\nLand  Use \nSoil Functions \n\nF(i) F(ii) F(iii) F(iv) F(v) \n\nNative vegetation  b\n\u00a7\n a a a a \n\nPasture b b b b b \n\nSugarcane a b c b c \n\n \n\nFigure 6 - Contribution of each soil functions in the SQI-2 under native vegetation, pasture \n\nand sugarcane in central-southern Brazil.\n \u00a7\n\nSame letter within each soil function indicates \n\nthat the mean values do not differ among land uses according to Tukey\u2019s test (p<0.05) \n\n \n\nOur results effectively described the critical situation associated with most Brazilian \n\npastureland. It is estimated that 70% of those areas are degraded or in the process of being \n\ndegraded (DIAS-FILHO, 2014). Recently, a national-scale study verified that the current \n\nproductivity (i.e., animal unit carrying capacity) of cultivated pasturelands is only 32-34% of \n\ntheir inherent potential (STRASSBURG et al., 2014). The low productivity of Brazilian \n\npasturelands has multiple causes as reported by Strassburg et al. (2014). Among them are \n\nimproper pasture management, including seedling failures and bare soil, continuous grazing, \n\nabsence of liming, maintenance of soil fertility through fertilization, and uncontrolled erosion, \n\nwhich all lead to soil degradation over time (DIAS-FILHO, 2014; STRASSBURG et al., \n\n2014). \n\nAt the regional scale, LUC from pasture to sugarcane showed no significant impact on \n\noverall SQ (Figure 5).

The SQI strategies showed sparse non-significant variations on SQ \n\nunder sugarcane compared to pasture, ranging from -6% (SQI-3) to +13% (SQI-5). \n\nRespectively, SQI-3 and SQI-5 were the indexes that gave the lowest and the highest weight \n\nto chemical indicators. Therefore, improving soil fertility attenuated negative implications of \n\nsugarcane production on soil physical and biological indicators within overall SQ assessment. \n\nThis was clearly demonstrated by weighted indexes (SQI-2, SQI-4 and SQI-6). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 7 - Contribution of each principal component (PC) and soil sector in the SQI-4 (A) \n\nand SQI-6 (B), respectively under native vegetation (NV), pasture (PA) and \n\nsugarcane (SC) in central-southern Brazil. \u00a7Same letter within each PC or soil sector \nindicates that the mean values do not differ among land uses according to Tukey\u2019s test (p<0.05) \n\n \n\nConversion from pasture to sugarcane had one positive effect on soil functions \u2013 that \n\nrelated to nutrient dynamics.

Finally, SQI-6 also was able to indicate that \n\nsugarcane production led to significant improvement on soil chemical indicators and decline \n\non physical and biological indicators. Overall, these results indicate that sugarcane expansion \n\nover degraded pasturelands seems to be an opportune way to meet increasing domestic and \n\nglobal ethanol demands, avoiding direct competition for land with food crops and natural \n\necosystems, as reported by Goldemberg et al. (2014) and Strassburg et al. (2014). However, \n\nthe results clearly indicated the necessity for improved management practices that can \n\nmitigate deleterious impacts of sugarcane production on soil physical/structural and biological \n\nindicators.  \n\n \n\n7.3.3 What is the best indexing strategy for assessing sugarcane expansion impacts on soil \n\nquality? \n\n \n\nAll six SQ indexing strategies were able to detect SQ changes induced by LUC, \n\nsuggesting that any of them could be used for monitoring SQ in sugarcane expansion in Brazil \n\n(Figure 5). However, a sensitivity test showed there were slight differences among the \n\nstrategies (Figure 8). The most complex strategy (SQI-2), which included the 38 indicator \n\nTDS and used weighting of the indicator scores provided by the soil function framework had \n\ngreatest sensitivity to detect SQ changes due to LUC. In contrast, the least sensitive SQI was \n\ncalculated using TDS without indicator weighting (SQI-1). These results suggest that using a \n\nmeaningful method (e.g., soil functions) for weighting and integrating indicator scores into an \n\nindex when a large dataset is available for SQ assessment is best, even though it is more \n\ncomplex than simple additive indexing and does not statistically modify the overall SQ \n\nassessment response (Figure 5).  \n\nThere also is no consensus in the literature regarding the benefits of indicator \n\nweighting. Andrews, Karlen and Mitchell (2002) and Askari and Holden (2014) concluded \n\nthat weighting the additive SQI did not change the relative SQI rankings for the treatments; \n\ntherefore, this extra step was unnecessary for analyzing vegetable production or other \n\nsystems. Mukherjee and Lal (2014) also reported similar effectiveness between simple and \n\nweighted indexes. They highlighted that appropriate weighting on scores can predict SQ with \n\nhigher performance which was consistent with our findings. On the other hand, Askari and \n\nHolden (2015) showed that a simple additive linear SQI was the most efficient for detecting \n\nmanagement practice impacts in arable soils.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 187 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8 - Sensitivity values of SQ indexing strategies used to assess the land-use change \n\n(native vegetation - pasture - sugarcane) impacts on soil quality in central-southern \n\nBrazil \n\n \n\nBoth the MDS-PCA (SQI-3 and SQI-4) and MDS-EO (SQI-5 and SQI-6) strategies were \n\neffective for detecting SQ changes using a reduced number of indicators (Figure 8). Similar \n\nresults were also reported by Andrews, Karlen and Mitchell (2002) and Lima et al. (2013), \n\nwho both concluded that a reduced number of carefully chosen indicators could adequately \n\nprovide the information needed for decision-making. From a practical perspective, this means \n\nthat for any one indexing strategy to become the standard for research, large-scale SQ \n\nassessments, or to facilitate discussion and cooperation, it must be rapid, reliable, and \n\neconomically feasible (QI et al., 2009). SQI-5 and SQI-6 strategies have an important \n\nadvantage compared to SQI-3 and SQI-4, since the latter two require a large dataset in order \n\nto perform a PCA and select fewer indicators. Therefore, simple SQI strategies (SQI-5 and \n\nSQI-6), show excellent potential for monitoring SQ changes in sugarcane expansion areas in \n\nBrazil. More specifically, between SQI-5 and SQI-6, we suggest opting for SQI-6, which \n\nprovides balanced weighting for chemical, physical and biological indicators. \n\nThe SQ indexing strategies were significantly correlated among themselves (Figure 9), \n\nconfirming a close relationship between simple and more complex strategies. This was also \n\nreported by Mukherjee and Lal (2014). Decreasing correlations between SQI-1 vs SQI-3 \n\n(r=0.93), SQI-1 vs SQI-5 (r=0.78), SQI-2 vs SQI-4 (r=0.47), and SQI-2 vs SQI-6 (r=0.34) \n\nwere observed. This indicates that as the indexes became simpler, correlations with more \n\ncomplex indexes that used the entire dataset were lower.

Figure 8 confirms there was a decreasing trend for \n\nsensitivity differences between simple and weighted indexes derived from the same sequence, \n\nas the comparisons moved from more complex to simpler strategies. \n\n \n\n7.4 Conclusions \n\n \n\nAll six indexing strategies efficiently detected SQ changes due to LUC for sugarcane \n\nexpansion in Brazilian tropical soils. Both, PCA and EO approaches were useful to reduce the \n\ntotal dataset without any significant interference on SQ ranking among land uses. These \n\nresults indicate that simple, easily-performed and more user-friendly SQI strategies (e.g., SQI-\n\n0.93 \np<0.001 \n\n0.89 \np<0.001 \n\nSimple \n\nAdditive \n\nWeighted \n\nAdditive \n\nSQI-1 \n\n \n\n \n\nSQI-3 \n\n \n\n \n\nSQI-5 \n\n \n\nSQI-2 \n\n \n\n \n\nSQI-4 \n\n \n\n \n\nSQI-6 \n\n \n\nTDS \n\n \n\n \n\nMDS-PCA \n\n \n\n \n\nMDS-EO \n\n \n\nComplexity \n\nof SQ \n\nindexing \n\nstrategies \n\n \n\n0.47 \np<0.001 \n\n0.34 \np<0.046 \n\n0.93 \np<0.001 \n\n0.78 \np<0.001 \n\n0.66 \np<0.001 \n\n\n\n 189 \n\n5 and SQI-6) were as effective and suitable for detecting LUC effects on SQ as more complex \n\nSQI strategies (e.g., SQI-1, SQI-2, SQI-3 and SQI-4). Although simple additive and weighted \n\nadditive SQIs were statistically similar, we recommend using weighted indexes, especially \n\nwhen the number of indicators is unbalanced among chemical, physical and biological \n\ncomponents. Therefore, a SQI strategy using a small number of carefully chosen soil \n\nindicators, such as pH, P, K, VESS and SOC, and proportional weighting for indicator scores \n\nwithin of each soil sector (chemical, physical and biological) could be adopted as a protocol \n\nfor SQ assessments in Brazilian sugarcane areas.  \n\n Our findings also suggest that long-term LUC from native vegetation to extensive \n\npasture depleted overall SQ, driven by decreases in chemical, physical and biological \n\nindicators. In contrast, conversion from pasture to sugarcane had no significant impact on \n\noverall SQ, primarily, because chemical improvements offset negative impacts on biological \n\nand physical indicators. Therefore, sugarcane expansion into degraded pastureland seems to \n\nbe a sustainable strategy to meet increasing demands for biofuels. Nevertheless, management \n\npractices that alleviate soil physical and biological degradation under sugarcane production \n\nmust be prioritized to avoid or minimize SQ depletions over time. \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\nANDERSON, J.M.; INGRAM, J.S.I.

Therefore, in recent decades the process of land-use change \n\n(LUC) has accelerated for expansion of bioenergy crops worldwide, and consequently has \n\nincreased the pressure on soil and other natural resources. In Brazil, the world\u2019s largest \n\nsugarcane-ethanol producer, sugarcane area has expanded by 35% last decade. Land-use \n\nchange for sugarcane expansion has resulted in extensive pastures being subjected to intensive \n\nmechanization and large inputs of agrochemicals (i.e., lime, fertilizer and pesticides). This \n\nland-use intensification has direct implications on soil quality (SQ), a key component for \n\necosystem functioning and consequently a key indicator for assessing the environmental \n\nsustainability of biofuel production. For this thesis, we hypothesized that LUC to support \n\nsugarcane expansion leads to overall SQ degradation. In order to test this hypothesis we \n\nconducted a field-study in three sites in the central-southern region, to assess the SQ response \n\nto the primary LUC sequence (i.e., native vegetation to pasture to sugarcane) associated to \n\nsugarcane expansion in Brazil. \n\nThe overall findings associated with this project show that: in chapter 2 we concluded \n\nthat LUC promoted significant impacts on soil chemical attributes. Long-term conversion \n\nfrom native vegetation to extensive pasture led to soil acidification as well as significant SOC \n\nand macronutrient depletions due to continuous cattle grazing coupled with the absence of \n\nlime and fertilizer inputs over time. In contrast, conversion from pasture to sugarcane \n\ndecreased soil acidity and increased macronutrient levels. Improvements in soil chemical \n\nquality were in direct response to sugarcane management including liming and nutrient \n\nreplenishment using mineral and/or organic fertilizers. However, long-term (~20 years) \n\nsugarcane production resulted in significant SOC depletions (0-30 cm layer). In chapter 3, we \n\ninvestigated soil P dynamics due to LUC, since P is the most limiting essential plant growth \n\nnutrient in weathered Brazilian soils. We verified that conversion from native vegetation to \n\nextensive pasture led to a sharp depletion of soil P pools. Under sugarcane production, soil \n\ntotal P stocks were increased; but most of P added by fertilizer accumulated in less plant-\n\navailable P forms. This confirmed the important role organic P has in providing available P to \n\nplants in these soils. Furthermore, we found a direct correlation between diversity of soil \n\nmacrofauna and labile P, confirming the crucial role of soil biota on nutrient cycling and other \n\nrelated ecosystem services.  \n\n\n\n 198 \n\nIn chapter 4, our results showed that LUC had deleterious impacts on soil physical \n\nquality. Continuous cattle trampling associated to low productivity of pasture (i.e., lower C \n\ninputs in the soil) induced significant soil compaction, and created an unbalanced ratio \n\nbetween water- and air-filled pore spaces in the pasture soils. Intensive mechanization used \n\nfor sugarcane production had a slight negative impact on soil physical properties compared to \n\npasture land use. Tillage performed for sugarcane planting and replanting did alleviate some \n\nof the soil compaction associated with long-term pasture, but our data suggested the effects \n\nare short-term persistent, and that soil reconsolidation trends to occur over time. Furthermore, \n\nperiodic tillage decreases soil resistance to erosion under sugarcane production. Overall, our \n\nfindings suggest that native vegetation, pasture and sugarcane soils were physically \n\nfunctioning at 90%, 70% and from 56 to 68% their potential capacity, respectively. To \n\nidentify a more user-friendly and cost-effective on-farm method for assessing soil physical \n\nchanges due to sugarcane expansion, we tested the Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure \n\n(VESS) method that was discussed in chapter 5. Overall, the VESS was sensitive for \n\ndetecting degradation in soil structural quality induced by LUC. In addition, VESS scores \n\nwere well-correlated with quantitative soil physical attributes, confirming its utility as a \n\npotential tool that should be incorporated into protocols for on-farm assessments of SQ in \n\nBrazilian sugarcane production areas. \n\nTo provide an overall assessment of SQ changes induced by LUC for sugarcane \n\nproduction in Brazil, the second step of this project focused on developing a SQ index (SQI) \n\nthat integrated soil chemical, physical and biological\n4\n indicators. We tested different \n\napproaches for evaluating SQ changes, since there is not a universal method for such \n\nassessments and this research topic is still relatively new in Brazil. In chapter 6, our initial use \n\nof the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF), a tool developed and broadly used \n\nin the USA for assessing SQ changes under wide range of soils, land uses and cropping \n\nsystems is discussed. The SMAF had never been used for Brazilian soils, so we worked to \n\nimprove some of the scoring algorithms, thus allowing proper assignment of scores for the \n\nsoil chemical, physical and biological indicators sampled under Brazilian tropical conditions. \n\nThe results showed that the SMAF could be used as a reliable and efficient tool to detect SQ \n\nchanges induced by LUC associated to sugarcane expansion in Brazil. Finnally, in chapter 7, \n\nwe tested six approaches ranging from more complex to simple for developing a \n\n                                                 \n\n4\n Biological data were measured from soil samples collected at the same sites and sampling time by Franco \n\n(2015). \n\n\n\n 199 \n\ncomprehensible SQI. Our findings indicated that simple, easily-performed and more user-\n\nfriendly SQ indexing strategies (i.e., about five indicators selected by expert opinion and \n\nintegrated through simple additive or weighted method) were as suitable for detecting LUC \n\neffects on soil as more complex strategies [i.e., using the total dataset (38 indicators) and \n\ncomplex weighting procedures based on soil functions]. Therefore, our recommended SQI \n\nstrategy using a small number of carefully chosen soil indicators, such as pH, P, K, VESS and \n\nSOC, and proportional weighting for indicator scores within of each soil sector (chemical, \n\nphysical and biological) could be adopted as an economically and technically efficient \n\nprotocol for SQ assessments in Brazilian sugarcane areas. \n\nOverall, the SMAF and SQIs scores suggested that long-term conversion from native \n\nvegetation to extensive pasture depleted overall SQ, due to decreases in chemical, physical \n\nand biological indicators. On average the soil functioning decreased about 20% from native \n\nvegetation to pasture. In contrast, conversion from pasture to sugarcane had no additional \n\nnegative impacts on overall SQ, mainly because chemical improvements offset negative \n\nimpacts on biological and physical attributes. Therefore, the projected sugarcane expansion \n\nover degraded pastureland seems to be a sustainable strategy to meet increasing demands for \n\nbiofuels. This suggests that our findings could be used as a scientific base by farmers, \n\nextension agents and public policy makers to adopt and develop management strategies that \n\nsustain proper soil fertility for sugarcane growth, increase C sequestration, alleviate soil \n\nphysical and biological degradation for improving SQ and the sustainability of sugarcane \n\nproduction in Brazil.  \n\nWe encourage future studies to test and validate our protocol for assessing and \n\nmonitoring SQ changes in sugarcane production under different soils and management \n\npractices. Furthermore, we suggest correlating SQ scores with other key-ecosystem endpoints, \n\nsuch as primary productivity, biodiversity, and water and air quality for better understanding \n\nthe overall environmental sustainability of sugarcane production system."}]}}}
