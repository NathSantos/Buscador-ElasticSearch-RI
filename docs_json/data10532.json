Harvest residues management and silvicultural operations impact on soil \nphysical and organic matter quality of eucalypt plantations. Adviser: Emanuelle \nMerc\u00eas Barros Soares. Co-adviser: Ivo Ribeiro da Silva.    \n \n\nBrazil is among the world\u2019s largest timber producers and Eucalyptus planted forests are \n\nresponsible for a significant portion of wood products supply. Furthermore, these forests \n\nplay an important role on mitigation of increasing atmospheric greenhouse gases. The \n\nperiod between harvesting and new rotation establishment, i.e. its first two or three years, \n\nconcentrates the major part of forest mechanical operations that may define achievable \n\nproductivity while causing harmful impacts on soil physical and organic properties. This \n\nthesis is divided in three chapters that evaluated and tried to provide a better \n\nunderstanding of these operations impact on eucalypt forest dynamics and soil properties. \n\nThe first chapter approached how the management of eucalypt harvest residues (HR) \n\ncould alter its decomposition pattern and the dynamics of two soil organic matter (SOM) \n\nfractions (Particulate Organic Matter \u2013 POM, and Associated to Minerals \u2013 MAOM). The \n\nexperiment was set up in an area where natural grasslands of Pampa Biome in the Rio \n\nGrande do Sul State, Brazil, have been recently converted to eucalypt forests. Removal \n\nof all residues (-R), only bark removal (-B) and maintenance of all residues (+B), all of \n\nthem combined with external 200 kg ha-1 of N addition (+N) or not (-N), were simulated \n\nin PVC micro-plots in a 3x2 full factorial with 4 replications. A 10 % 15N-enriched \n\nsolution was used as N source to track the role of mineral-N in the process. Whole micro-\n\nplots were sampled at 0, 3, 6, 12 and 36 mo. after experiment establishment and taken to \n\nthe lab for further analysis. All sampling times were used to build decomposition curve, \n\nwhile C, ?13C, N and 15N content associated with both SOM fractions were determined \n\non 36 mo. samples in 0 -1 and 1 -5 cm soil layers. In these same layers, SOM fractions \n\nfrom 12 and 36 mo. samples were characterized with Pyrolysis associated with Gas \n\nChromatography/Mass Spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) to obtain a better understanding of \n\nSOM formation pathway under different HR management. Almost 80 % of HR have been \n\ndecomposed until 3 yr. Bark (p<0.05) and mineral-N (p=0.06) presence slowed down \n\ndecomposition. Overall, changes in C and N content and ?13C due to residues presence \n\nwere more expressive in 0-1 cm layer and POM fraction. +B tended to increase HR \n\ncontribution, but its effect was more distinguished in -N treatments. Mineral-N fraction \n\nwas always higher when HR were present, particularly in +B treatments, but its \n\n\n\nviii \n\n \n\ncontribution to SOM fractions was always smaller than 4 %. Py-GC/MS products \n\nrevealed a direct role of HR on POM formation, but their effect on MAOM seems to be \n\nindirect by altering microbial composition and its products. In summary, we showed how \n\nHR management drives SOM fractions chemistry and we conclude that a sustainable \n\nmanagement of HR can enhance soil C accrual. In the second chapter was evaluated how \n\ntwo different harvest systems would change soil physical properties, soil C content and \n\nsoil CO2 efflux, and initial tree growth under two different silvicultural system. To this \n\nend, two adjacent stands located in Estrela do Sul/MG were selected. Each stand was \n\nharvested and logged with a different system (Feller + Forwarder \u2013 F+F; and Feller + \n\nSkidder \u2013 F+S) and soil physical properties [Soil Bulk Density (Ds), Micro (Mi), Macro \n\n(Ma) and Total Porosity (TP), and Penetration Resistance (PR)], SOM properties [Labile-\n\nC, C associated with Particulate (C-POM) and Mineral (C-MAOM) fractions] soil CO2 \n\nefflux and stump mortality rate, were assessed after harvesting operations and compared \n\nwith reference (before harvesting). Afterwards, each stand was divided in coppice and \n\nreplanting, and we followed soil CO2 efflux after planting and one year after planting, \n\nwhen trees height (H) and SOM properties were also measured in both areas and system \n\nto evaluate how areas would recover from harvesting impacts. All soil variables were \n\nassessed at planting and inter-planting row positions. Both systems affected soil density \n\nand soil pore configuration, but in different ways. F+F concentrates traffic at inter-\n\nplanting row position, and therefore causes a slightly higher compaction in this region, \n\nwhile F+S does not follow traffic routes and impacts planting-row similarly, resulting in \n\nhigher stump mortality. Harvesting operations increased Ds, Mi and PR and reduced Ma \n\nand TP at all layers. Soil CO2 efflux was not affected by harvesting operations. \n\nDifferences in soil CO2 were found after planting, when it was higher in F+S system, that \n\nalso presented higher labile-C and C-POM. One year after planting, mortality rate was \n\nstill higher under coppice in F+S system, that also presented lower trees. In turn, trees \n\nwere higher in replanting in this area. Soil respiration behaved similarly, i.e., higher in \n\nF+F under coppice and lower under replanting. Overall, after one year coppice system \n\npresented higher Labile-C, C-POM and C-MAOM. We concluded that each harvest \n\nsystem affects row and inter-row differently, creating different soil functional zones \n\ninside same area, that might be enhanced by the next silvicultural system chosen, and \n\nshould be observed when assessing ecosystem services and site condition. Lastly, the \n\nthird chapter evaluated the effect of land use change from natural grasslands of Pampa \n\nBiome to eucalypt plantations, as well as N fertilization effects on initial eucalypt growth, \n\nfine-root biomass (FRB) and its spatial distribution, and C, ?13C and N content associated \n\n\n\nix \n\n \n\nwith SOM fractions (POM and MAOM). 4 N-levels were tested (24, 36, 48 e 108 kg ha-\n\n1 of N) on initial tree growth (until 2 yr.). Afterwards, representative trees were chosen to \n\nevaluate FRB until 40 cm depth, and soil samples also until 40 cm depth were collected \n\nfor SOM evaluation. Positive effect of N on tree growth (diameter and height) was seen \n\ninitially after fertilization, i.e., 1.5 yr., whereas at 2 yr. N effects were seen only at trees \n\nheight. The FRB fitted regression showed increase of FRB until 56 kg ha-1 of N, and after \n\nthat level a decrease in FRB was observed, and the highest N level used resulted in the \n\nlowest FRB. Both horizontal and vertical anisotropy in fine-root distribution were \n\nobserved, and besides differences among N levels, we could not see a clear relation \n\nbetween N fertilization and fine-root spatial distribution. Overall, land use change to \n\neucalypt plantations increased soil C content, particularly in top-soil layers. 36 kg ha-1 \n\nresulted in higher C-POM in 0 -10, while 48 kg ha-1 resulted in higher C-MAOM in this \n\nlayer. C and N dynamics were tightly correlated, especially in MAOM fraction. C-POM \n\nwas positively correlated with FRB. Tillage had a strong control on soil C and N stocks, \n\nenhancing C deposition and turnover at row (ridge) region, most likely for favoring roots \n\ndevelopment in this region. Therefore, it is shown that N fertilization may alter initial tree \n\ngrowth, but its effects don\u2019t seem to last longer. Nevertheless, N effects can be reflected \n\non fine-root biomass and distribution and C and N of SOM fractions. We hope that our \n\nfindings could guide the adoption of proper management practices in eucalypt plantations \n\nin Brazil, enhancing the productivity and sustainability of these forests. \n\n\n\nx \n\n \n\nRESUMO \n\n \nFERREIRA, Gabriel William Dias, D.Sc., Universidade Federal de Vi\u00e7osa, janeiro de \n2017. Impacto do manejo dos res\u00edduos da colheita e de opera\u00e7\u00f5es silviculturais sobre \na qualidade f\u00edsica e da mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica do solo em planta\u00e7\u00f5es de eucalipto. \nOrientador: Emanuelle Merc\u00eas Barros Soares. Coorientador: Ivo Ribeiro da Silva.    \n \n\nO Brasil \u00e9 um dos maiores produtores mundiais de madeira e planta\u00e7\u00f5es de eucalipto s\u00e3o \n\nrespons\u00e1veis por boa parte do suprimento dos produtos madeireiros no pa\u00eds. Al\u00e9m disso, \n\nessas planta\u00e7\u00f5es desempenham papel importante na mitiga\u00e7\u00e3o do aumento dos gases de \n\nefeito estufa na atmosfera. No per\u00edodo compreendido entre a colheita de um ciclo e o \n\nestabelecimento de uma nova rota\u00e7\u00e3o, ou seja, os seus primeiros dois ou tr\u00eas anos, se \n\nconcentra a maior parte das opera\u00e7\u00f5es florestais, que podem definir o sucesso do \n\npovoamento e ao mesmo tempo causar impactos negativos em propriedades f\u00edsicas e \n\norg\u00e2nicas do solo. Esta tese, dividida em tr\u00eas cap\u00edtulos, teve como objetivo avaliar o \n\nimpacto dessas opera\u00e7\u00f5es sobre a din\u00e2mica das florestas de eucalipto e propriedades do \n\nsolo. No primeiro cap\u00edtulo foi abordado como o manejo dos res\u00edduos da colheita do \n\neucalipto pode alterar a sua decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o e a din\u00e2mica de duas fra\u00e7\u00f5es (Mat\u00e9ria Org\u00e2nica \n\nParticulada \u2013 MOP e Associada aos Minerais \u2013 MAM) da mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica do solo \n\n(MOS). O experimento foi conduzido em \u00e1rea onde pastagens naturais do Pampa Ga\u00facho \n\nforam recentemente convertidas em plantios de eucalipto. Foram simuladas a remo\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ntotal dos res\u00edduos (-R), a remo\u00e7\u00e3o apenas da casca (-B) e a manuten\u00e7\u00e3o total dos res\u00edduos \n\n(+B), combinados (+N) ou n\u00e3o (-N) com a adi\u00e7\u00e3o de 200 kg ha-1 de N mineral, em um \n\nfatorial 3x2 completo com 4 repeti\u00e7\u00f5es. Uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o enriquecida em 10 % com 15N foi \n\nutilizada como fonte de N para tra\u00e7ar o N mineral em todo o processo. Aos 0, 3, 6, 12 e \n\n36 meses ap\u00f3s a instala\u00e7\u00e3o amostras dos res\u00edduos e do solo foram coletadas e levadas ao \n\nlaborat\u00f3rio. Dados de todos os tempos foram utilizados para construir a curva de \n\ndecomposi\u00e7\u00e3o dos res\u00edduos, enquanto que os teores de C, ?13C, N e ?15N associados \u00e0s \n\nduas fra\u00e7\u00f5es da MOS foram determinados no \u00faltimo tempo nas camadas de 0 -1 e 1 -5 \n\ncm do solo. Nessas mesmas camadas, as fra\u00e7\u00f5es da MOS dos solos de 12 e 36 meses \n\nforam submetidas \u00e0 pirolise associada com cromatografia gasosa e espectrometria de \n\nmassa (Pi-CG/EM) para caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica e tentativa de melhor entendimento sobre \n\nos processos de forma\u00e7\u00e3o da MOS sob os diferentes manejos de res\u00edduos. Ao final dos \n\ntr\u00eas anos, cerca de 80 % de todo o res\u00edduo tinha sido decomposto. A presen\u00e7a da casca \n\n(p<0,05) e do N-mineral (p=0,06) diminu\u00edram a taxa de decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o do res\u00edduo. O \n\nefeito dos res\u00edduos sobre o C e N das fra\u00e7\u00f5es da MOS foram mais expressivos na fra\u00e7\u00e3o \n\n\n\nxi \n\n \n\nparticulada e camada de 0 -1 cm. Em geral, a presen\u00e7a dos res\u00edduos aumentou os teores \n\nde C e N, e diminuiu os valores de ?13C, indicando contribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos res\u00edduos para as \n\nfra\u00e7\u00f5es da MOS. A contribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos res\u00edduos \u00e9 maior na presen\u00e7a da casca, especialmente \n\nnos tratamentos -N. A contribui\u00e7\u00e3o do N mineral para as fra\u00e7\u00f5es da MOS foi inferior a 4 \n\n%, mas foi sempre maior quando os res\u00edduos estavam presentes. Os resultados da Pi-\n\nCG/EM indicaram contribui\u00e7\u00e3o direta dos res\u00edduos para a fra\u00e7\u00e3o MOP, enquanto que a \n\ninfluencia na fra\u00e7\u00e3o MAM parece ser indireta pela altera\u00e7\u00e3o da comunidade microbiana \n\ne seus produtos. Concluindo, foi mostrado como o manejo dos res\u00edduos altera a \n\ncomposi\u00e7\u00e3o da MOS e que a manuten\u00e7\u00e3o dos res\u00edduos na \u00e1rea acarreta em aumento nos \n\nteores de C da MOS. No segundo cap\u00edtulo, foi avaliado como dois sistemas diferentes de \n\ncolheita de eucalipto alterariam propriedades f\u00edsicas do solo, os teores de C e a emiss\u00e3o \n\nde CO2 pelo solo, bem como o crescimento inicial das \u00e1rvores ap\u00f3s a ado\u00e7\u00e3o de dois \n\nsistemas silviculturais distintos. Para isso, dois talh\u00f5es adjacentes localizados em Estrela \n\ndo Sul/MG foram selecionados. Cada talh\u00e3o foi colhido com um sistema diferente (Feller \n\ne Forwarder - F+F, ou Feller e Skidder - F+S) e propriedades f\u00edsicas [Densidade do Solo \n\n(Ds), Micro (Mi), Macro (Ma), Porosidade Total (PT) e Resist\u00eancia \u00e0 Penetra\u00e7\u00e3o (RP)], \n\norg\u00e2nicas (C l\u00e1bil, e C associado \u00e0s fra\u00e7\u00f5es MOP e MAM), emiss\u00e3o de CO2, e \n\nmortalidade das cepas foram avaliadas antes e depois da colheita. Posteriormente, cada \n\n\u00e1rea foi dividida em dois sistemas silviculturais: talhadia e alto-fuste (reforma), e a \n\nemiss\u00e3o de CO2 pelo solo, fra\u00e7\u00f5es de C do solo e a altura das \u00e1rvores foram analisados \n\nap\u00f3s um ano para avaliar como cada \u00e1rea se recuperaria dos impactos da colheita. Todas \n\nas avalia\u00e7\u00f5es foram feitas nas linhas e entrelinhas de plantio. Ambos os sistemas de \n\ncolheita afetaram negativamente as propriedades f\u00edsicas do solo, mas de maneira \n\ndiferente. Enquanto F+F concentra o impacto nas entrelinhas, o sistema F+S n\u00e3o segue \n\nlinhas de trafego pr\u00e9-estabelecidas, causando maior compacta\u00e7\u00e3o nas linhas de plantio e \n\nconsequentemente maior mortalidade de cepas. A colheita aumentou Ds, Mi, RP e reduziu \n\nMa e PT em todas as posi\u00e7\u00f5es, sistemas e profundidade. A emiss\u00e3o de CO2 do solo n\u00e3o \n\nfoi alterada pela colheita. Diferen\u00e7as na emiss\u00e3o de CO2 s\u00f3 foram encontradas ap\u00f3s o \n\nplantio, quando foi mais elevada no F+S em ambos sistemas silviculturais, e C l\u00e1bil e C-\n\nMOP tamb\u00e9m estavam mais elevados. Ap\u00f3s um ano, a mortalidade ainda era maior no \n\nsistema F+S e altura menor no sistema de talhadia. Por outro lado, as \u00e1rvores no F+S sob \n\nreforma eram mais altas. A respira\u00e7\u00e3o do solo apresentou padr\u00e3o semelhante, ou seja, \n\nmais alta em \u00e1rea de talhadia no F+F e mais baixa nas \u00e1reas reformadas. C l\u00e1bil, C-MOP \n\ne C-MAM foram significativamente mais altos nos sistemas de talhadia. Conclui-se que \n\ncada sistema de colheita afeta linha e entrelinha de plantio diferentemente, criando \n\n\n\nxii \n\n \n\ndiferentes zonas no talh\u00e3o, que podem ser exacerbadas com a ado\u00e7\u00e3o de diferentes \n\nsistemas silviculturais. Essas diferen\u00e7as devem ser observadas quando s\u00e3o avaliados \n\nimpactos sobre o solo. No terceiro cap\u00edtulo foram avaliados o efeito da substitui\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\npastagens naturais do Pampa Ga\u00facho por plantios de eucalipto e o efeito da aduba\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nnitrogenada sobre o crescimento inicial, a biomassa e distribui\u00e7\u00e3o espacial de ra\u00edzes finas \n\nde eucalipto, e teores de C, ?13C e N associados \u00e0s fra\u00e7\u00f5es MOP e MAM da MOS. Foram \n\ntestadas 4 doses de N (24, 36, 48 e 108 kg ha-1 de N) e o crescimento inicial das \u00e1rvores \n\nfoi avaliado at\u00e9 a idade de dois anos. Posteriormente, foram selecionadas \u00e1rvores \n\nrepresentativas que tiveram a biomassa de ra\u00edzes finas (BRF) avaliadas at\u00e9 a profundidade \n\nde 40 cm, ao mesmo tempo em que se realizaram as avalia\u00e7\u00f5es da MOS tamb\u00e9m at\u00e9 40 \n\ncm. Efeitos positivos da aduba\u00e7\u00e3o nitrogenada foram observados inicialmente sobre \n\ndi\u00e2metro e altura, mas aos dois anos apenas a altura foi positivamente influenciada. A \n\nregress\u00e3o ajustada para a BRF indicou aumento da BRF at\u00e9 56 kg ha-1 de N, sendo que \n\nap\u00f3s esse n\u00edvel a BRF diminui e a maior dose de N testada resultou na menor BRF \n\nobservada. Foi observada anisotropia na distribui\u00e7\u00e3o radicular horizontal e verticalmente \n\ne, apesar de diferen\u00e7as entre as doses, n\u00e3o foi poss\u00edvel tra\u00e7ar uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o clara entre as \n\ndoses de N e a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o espacial de ra\u00edzes finas. Em geral, a introdu\u00e7\u00e3o de eucalipto \n\nelevou os teores de C do solo. Os efeitos foram maiores nas camadas superficiais. 36 kg \n\nha-1 resultou nos maiores teores de C-MOP na camada 0 -10, enquanto que 48 kg ha-1 \n\nresultou nos maiores C-MAM nessa camada. As din\u00e2micas de C e N apresentaram-se \n\nfortemente correlacionadas, especialmente na fra\u00e7\u00e3o MAM. Os teores de C-MOP \n\ncorrelacionaram-se positivamente com BRF. O sistema de preparo do solo influencia os \n\nteores de C e N no solo, aumentando-os na linha de plantio, provavelmente por favorecer \n\no desenvolvimento de ra\u00edzes nessa regi\u00e3o. Assim, verificou-se que a adi\u00e7\u00e3o de N pode \n\nafetar positivamente o crescimento inicial do eucalipto, mas os efeitos n\u00e3o parecem ser \n\nduradouros. Por outro lado, o efeito do N parece ser observado por mais tempo sobre a \n\nbiomassa de ra\u00edzes finas e C e N das fra\u00e7\u00f5es da MOS. Espera-se que os resultados \n\nencontrados na presente tese possam ser utilizados para nortear as pr\u00e1ticas de manejo \n\nadotadas em plantios de eucalipto no Brasil, trazendo maior produtividade e \n\nsustentabilidade \u00e0 essas florestas. \n\n\n\n1 \n\n \n\nI. GENERAL INTRODUCTION \n\nIt is estimated that timber world market will increase 40 % in the next 35 years. \n\nConsidering current productivity levels of Eucalyptus, the most planted genus worldwide, \n\nthis expected growth would require additional planting of 210 million of hectares (IB\u00c1, \n\n2015). Brazil is among the world\u2019s largest wood producers and presents the seventh \n\nbiggest forest planted area in the world (Colodette et al., 2014). Planted forests are \n\nresponsible for 91 % of industrial wood production in the country. Estimates point out \n\nthat about 7.5 million hectares of Brazilian territory are occupied by planted forests, being \n\n72 % of those only by Eucalyptus genus (IB\u00c1, 2015). Although extensive, the area \n\ncovered by planted forest covers only 0.9 % of national territory, which places the county \n\nin a highlighted position in future forecasts of the world wood chain supply. Moreover, \n\nthe country already presents the world highest average productivity (~ 40 m3 ha-1 yr-1 for \n\nEucalyptus plantations) (IB\u00c1, 2015). The great pressure in international agreements to \n\npreserve native forests and mitigate increasing greenhouse gases concentration in the \n\natmosphere and climate change further enhances the importance of these forest \n\nplantations. \n\nEucalypt forests are recognized as an efficient atmospheric CO2 sink, and \n\nreforestation is considered as a sustainable practice by the Clean Development \n\nMechanism of Kyoto Protocol and fomented by the Low Carbon Emission Agricultural \n\nPlan (Plano ABC) of the Brazilian National Government. The recent adoption of \n\nminimum tillage technique follows similar principles of no-till systems adopted in \n\nagriculture, that have resulted in significant increases in soil carbon (C) stock (Diekow et \n\nal., 2005; Lal, 2004), plays in favor of planted forests. However, these forests ability to \n\nlong-term store C is still questionable, since they are constantly managed to obtain high \n\nproductivity in increasingly shorter rotations, and an elevated C and nutrient export occurs \n\nat every harvesting (~ 7-year average rotation). An alternative would be to increase C \n\ntransference to the soil, a larger and more stable pool (Lal, 2005, 2004), particularly by \n\nkeeping non-or-less commercial components in the field after harvesting, as they could \n\naccount for up to 40 % of above-ground biomass at harvesting (Gatto et al., 2010).  \n\nNevertheless, reforestation effects on soil C are still not a consensus, and either \n\nincreases or decreases on soil C stock have been observed due to several factors such as \n\nprevious land use, edaphoclimatic conditions and management practices adopted (Cook \n\net al., 2016; Li et al., 2012; Lima et al., 2006; Zinn et al., 2002). The lack of sensibility \n\nof total soil C concentration contributes to these divergences. Hence, the use of soil \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\norganic matter (SOM) fractionation methods, isotopes and molecular techniques could \n\nbring new insights and provide a better understanding of SOM dynamics under eucalypt \n\nforests. \n\nThe period between harvesting and new rotation establishment, i.e. its first two or \n\nthree years, concentrates the major part of forest mechanical operations and could define \n\nachievable productivity while may cause harmful impacts on soil physical, chemical and \n\nbiological properties. We highlight harvesting and logging, harvest residues management, \n\nsilvicultural system choice and fertilization as main defining operations. Studies \n\naddressing these operations effects on SOM are still scarce, making uncertain the real and \n\npotential role of eucalypt forests to mitigate climate change. These uncertainties are \n\ngreater in new forest expansion areas, particularly in the Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, \n\nwhere expansion is occurring over natural grasslands of Pampa Biome, that is a fragile \n\necosystem that has a significant portion of its soil degraded due to inadequate \n\nmanagement and excessive grazing (Pillar et al., 2012; Roesch et al., 2009). \n\nThis thesis is divided in three chapters aiming at filling some of these gaps, \n\nproviding a better understanding on management practices effects on eucalypt forests and \n\nSOM dynamics. The first chapter uses a decomposition experiment to address harvest \n\nresidues management effects on dynamics of C and N of SOM fractions. We selected a \n\nsite in Rio Grande do Sul State where Eucalyptus afforestation over natural grassland was \n\njust happening and simulated harvest residues managements practices. Therefore, natural \n\ndifferences between the 13C isotope signature of C3 (new, eucalypt) and C4 (old, \n\ngrassland) plants could be used to quantify harvest residues contribution to SOM pools. \n\nWe also took advantage of differences between SOM and harvest residues chemistry and \n\nused pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) to characterize \n\nchanges in SOM overtime and elucidate SOM formation pathways under different harvest \n\nresidues managements. \n\nIn the second chapter is studied how different harvest systems and afterwards \n\ndifferent silvivultural systems would alter soil physical properties, soil CO2 emission, C \n\ncontent in different SOM fractions and initial tree growth. We selected two adjacent \n\nloamy-soil sites in Minas Gerais State to compare these different systems, as loamy soils \n\nare more prone to physical damage. The two stands were followed over the course of one \n\nyear from harvesting to fertilization operations.  Lastly, the third chapter assesses the \n\neffect land use change from natural grassland of Pampa Biome to eucalypt forests by \n\nchanges in SOM properties, and how nitrogen fertilization would affect initial tree \n\ngrowth, fine-root biomass and spatial distribution and SOM dynamics. Trees were \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nmeasured over the first two years, and early changes in SOM properties were evaluated \n\nby SOM fractionation in two pools with different turnover time and sensitivity to land \n\nuse change, and C and N content, and the proportion of C-derived from eucalypt (C3) \n\nusing isotope techniques, were determined in each SOM pool. \n\n \n\n2.

CHAPTER 1 \n \n\nEucalyptus harvest residue management enhances SOM accrual and alters \n\nchemistry of SOM fractions \n\n \nABSTRACT \n \nEucalyptus forests have been considered a key low-carbon land use, efficiently sinking \natmospheric CO2. Its non-or-less-commercial components (Harvest residues \u2013 HR) can \naccount for up to 40 % of the aboveground biomass at harvesting. Keeping HR in the \nfield could enhance CO2 sequestration, especially if they could be transformed into stable \nforms of soil organic carbon (SOC). We collected samples from an experiment set up in \na new frontier of Eucalyptus forest expansion in Southern Brazil and used micro-plots of \nPVC inserted 10 cm into the soil to assess the effect of simulated management practices \n[removal of all residues (-R), only bark removal (-B) and maintenance of all residues \n(+B), all of them combined with external nitrogen addition (+N) or not (-N)] on \ndecomposition rate, carbon (C) transfer and C stabilization. A 10 % 15N-enriched solution \nwas used as N source to track the role of mineral-N in the process. Whole micro-plots \nwere sampled five times (0, 3, 6, 12 and 36 mo. after experiment establishment). At each \ntime, residues were carefully separated from soil and soil samples were divided in 0 -1 \nand 1 -5 cm soil layers for analysis. We assess HR management effects on soil organic \nmatter (SOM) fractions [Particulate organic matter (POM) and Mineral-associated \norganic matter (MAOM)] by changes in C and N content and changes in the natural \nabundance of ?13C, as well as changes in soil fraction chemistry by Py-GC/MS. Almost \n80 % of HR have been decomposed until 3 yr. Bark (p<0.05) and mineral-N (p=0.06) \npresence slowed down decomposition. HR had great impact on SOM properties after 3 \nyr. of experiment. Changes in C content and ?13C were more expressive in 0-1 cm layer \nand POM fraction. Overall, HR presence increased C content and decreased ?13C values, \nindicating a higher fraction derived from HR in SOC. +B tended to increase HR \ncontribution, but its effect was more distinguished in -N treatments. Changes in N content \nfollowed the same trend observed for C. Mineral-N fraction was always higher when HR \nwere present, particularly in +B treatments, but its contribution to SOM fractions was \nalways smaller than 4 %. Py-GC/MS products revealed a distinct formation pathway of \nSOM fractions. HR have a direct role on POM formation, but their effect on MAOM \nseems to be indirect by altering microbial composition and its products. Lignin \ndisappeared in 3 yr. MAOM \u2013 1 -5 samples, indicating that it\u2019s not stable even associated \nwith minerals and aboveground litter it\u2019s not efficient to keep its content below top-soil \nlayer. In summary, we showed how HR management drives SOM fractions chemistry and \nwe conclude that a sustainable management of HR can enhance soil C accrual. \n \nKeywords: Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (Py-GC/MS); 13C and \n15N stable isotopes; soil organic matter formation.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\n1. INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nBrazil is among the biggest pulp and sawn wood producers in the world. Planted \n\nforests cover more than 7.5 million hectares in the country and reduce the pressure over \n\nnative forests, particularly the Amazon (IB\u00c1, 2015). With an average productivity of 40 \n\nm3 ha-1 yr-1 in 7 yr. rotations, Eucalyptus plantations are the main responsible for wood \n\nproduction and occupy ~ 72 % of forest planted area (Colodette et al., 2014; IB\u00c1, 2015). \n\nSustainable management of these forests usually relies on practices that maintain or \n\nincrease soil organic matter (SOM) stocks, since it has a major role on nutrient dynamics \n\nin the tropics. Plants are the major carbon (C) source for SOM and particularly in these \n\nforests, litter, root turnover and harvest residues (HR) are the main inputs.  \n\nBasically, HR are non-or-less-commercial components composed by leaves, \n\nbranches and twigs, non-commercial stem (small diameter at thinner end) and bark. \n\nAround 30 t ha-1 of HR are generated in an average eucalypt rotation in Brazil (Gatto et \n\nal., 2010). Maintaining HR in the field has proven to provide several benefits on soil \n\nphysical (Jesus et al., 2015; Silva et al., 2007) and chemical properties (Kumaraswamy et \n\nal., 2014; Laclau et al., 2010b; Mendham et al., 2003), and thus tree growth (Laclau et \n\nal., 2010a; Mendham et al., 2014; Rocha et al., 2016; Versini et al., 2013). HR impacts \n\non SOM stocks, though, is still debated (Kumaraswamy et al., 2014; Rocha et al., 2016) \n\nand possible effects on SOM chemistry are even less studied (Mathers et al., 2003). \n\nActually, studies addressing changes in SOM quality due to Eucalyptus plantations \n\nintroduction are scarce (Sanderman et al., 2014; Santana et al., 2015; Soares et al., 2013). \n\nSeveral authors have tried to understand the pathway of SOM formation by litter \n\ninput (Bradford et al., 2013; Cotrufo et al., 2015; Gunina and Kuzyakov, 2014; Hatton et \n\nal., 2015; Mambelli et al., 2011). The presence of more complex and lignified woody \n\nmaterials among HR components might change their decomposition pattern and therefore \n\ntheir role on C cycle (Bradford et al., 2014; Ferreira et al., 2016; Magn\u00fasson et al., 2016). \n\nManagement practices like changes in HR mix and increasing nitrogen (N) fertilization \n\naiming at higher productivity might also affect C dynamics (Berg and Matzner, 1997; \n\nSouza et al., 2016; Vivanco and Austin, 2011). Particularly, the possible interaction \n\nbetween lignified compounds and tannins of eucalypt HR with N requires further \n\ninvestigation (Knorr et al., 2005; Kraus et al., 2003). \n\nTo understand the dynamics of transference from plant-litter to SOM, separate \n\nSOM into different functional pools is crucial. Physical fractionation is based on the \n\npremises that the association with finer mineral particles (silt and clay) play a key role on \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nthe turnover and stability of SOM (Dungait et al., 2012; von L\u00fctzow et al., 2007). \n\nParticulate Organic Matter (POM), i.e. OM not associated with minerals, may be the entry \n\nof plant litter into SOM pool and is characterized for fast turnover time and low stability \n\n(Grandy et al., 2007; Gunina and Kuzyakov, 2014), although some authors recently have \n\nshown a direct flow of soluble components of litter to stable mineral associated pools \n\n(MAOM) (Cotrufo et al., 2015; Sanderman et al., 2014). MAOM, in turn, comprises the \n\nmajor part of SOM, where the protection against microbial accessibility and/or an organo-\n\nmineral association grant stability to this pool. Whilst POM is formed basically by plant \n\ninputs (Grandy et al., 2007), microbial products dominate MAOM fraction and plant \n\nsignal, even from recalcitrant compounds, is almost absent in this fraction (Grandy and \n\nNeff, 2008; Klotzb\u00fccher et al., 2016). We argue if this behavior would be the same with \n\nmore lignified inputs like HR or could more lignified materials create a breakdown \n\ncontinuum and be stabilized into stable pools (Sanderman et al., 2014)? \n\nIn this study, we tried to understand the fate of eucalypt HR on SOM dynamics. \n\nWe took advantage of an experimental network set up across representative areas for \n\neucalypt production (Ferreira et al., 2016; Souza et al., 2016). A unique site where \n\nEucalyptus afforestation over natural grassland was just happening was selected, so \n\nnatural differences in the 13C isotope signature of C3 (eucalypt) and C4 (grassland) plants \n\ncould be used to quantify HR contribution to SOM pools. Pyrolysis gas chromatography-\n\nmass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) was used to create a fingerprint of SOM fractions and \n\nassess similarities between them in a time sequence. Treatments were applied based on \n\ntwo hypotheses: (i) residues mix, particularly bark presence, would increase HR \n\ncomplexity and C stabilization; (ii) increasing nitrogen availability would alter C \n\ntransference to more stabilized pools either by eliminating any possible constraint due to \n\neucalypt HR low N content or by suppressing lignin decomposers activity. \n\n \n\n2.  MATERIAL AND METHODS \n \n2.1. Site description \n\n \nExperiment was carried out in Southern Brazil (30\u00b026\u2019S; 54\u00b031\u2019W), in Rio \n\nGrande do Sul State, near Brazil-Uruguay border. We selected a representative site in a \n\nregion that is considered a new frontier of Eucalyptus plantation in Brazil, where an \n\nexpansion of these forests over natural grasslands of Pampa Biome has been occurring.  \n\nThe natural grassland (C4) of selected site was replaced by Eucalyptus (C3) planted forests \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nat the same time at experiment set up, so we could use and maximize differences in natural \n\nisotope signature and chemistry between fresh input (C3 harvest residues) and former \n\nSOM. Grassland was eliminated using a non-selective herbicide (glyphosate) and \n\nEucalyptus dunnii seedlings were planted at 2.2 x 3.3 m spacing. \n\nSite is located in a sub-tropical climate area, with mean annual temperature \n\n(MAT) of 18 oC and annual rainfall of 1351 mm during experiment years (Data from \n\nBrazilian National Institute of Spatial Research \u2013 INPE \u2013 S. Gabriel/RS station, located \n\nat ~17 km away from experimental site at similar altitude). Soils from the region are \n\nformed from sedimentary material mainly composed by arenite, siltite and argillite \n\n(MAPA, 1973; Roesch et al., 2009). Soil site was classified as Inceptsol (U.S. \n\nTaxonomy), its main properties are shown in Table 1 and SOM characterization is \n\npresented in Table 2. \n\n \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Soil properties (0 -10 cm layer) at experiment beginning. \n\npH(1) SB(2) SBD(3) TP(4) \nParticle-Size(5) \n\nClay Silt Sand \n\n- cmolc dm-3 g cm-3 m3 m-3 % \n\n4.71 7.71 1.15 0.53 28 55 17 \n (1)Determined in water, 1:2.5 soil:water ratio; (2)Sum of Bases, Ca2+ and Mg2+ determined in KCl 1 mol L-\n1, K+ and Na+ determined with Melich-1 extractor.

Experimental design \n\n Harvest residues used in this experiment came from a commercial E. urograndis \n\nhybrid stand harvested at two-year age. These are the same residues used in an \n\nexperimental network set up across representative sites in Brazil aiming at understanding \n\ndecomposition processes of eucalypt harvest residues under different management \n\npractices and its effect on soil carbon and properties (Ferreira et al., 2016; Souza et al., \n\n2016). Trees were separated into leaves, branches, non-commercial stem, bark, and roots. \n\nResidues were dried at 45 oC in a forced draft oven, chopped in smaller pieces varying \n\nfrom 4 to 8 cm (leaves were left uncut) and dry stored until experiment set up. Proportions \n\nof each component used to represent harvest residue and its total composition were based \n\non observations of harvested commercial plantations with a mean annual increment of 50 \n\nm3 ha-1 yr-1 (Ferreira et al., 2016). \n\n Micro-plots made by PVC tubes of 15 x 15 cm (diameter x height) were used to \n\nstudy HR decomposition and C transfer to the soil. Tubes were introduced 10 cm into the \n\nsoil between planting rows. Six lateral holes (20-mm diameter) were made in the tube \n\nwall to allow fauna movement and water flow. Residues were placed on soil surface inside \n\nthe tubes and then tubes were covered after treatment application with a 1-mm mesh net \n\nto avoid external litter input. The use of this type of micro-plot has been proved to be \n\nefficient to study decomposition, minimizing some problems found in litter bag studies \n\nsuch poor contact between litter and soil, fauna exclusion, stolen or lost bags, or higher \n\nprevious processing and litter fragmentation (Ferreira et al., 2016; Powers et al., 2009; \n\nShorohova and Kapitsa, 2014; Souza et al., 2016). \n\n Harvest residues composition and the effect of an external N source were studied \n\nin a 3 x 2 full-factorial, split-plot in time randomized block design with four replications. \n\nWe tested the effect of residue removal (-R), removal of bark only (-B), and maintenance \n\nof all residues (+B), combined (+N) or not (-N) with an external N source on \n\ndecomposition (-B and +B treatments, only) and SOM dynamics. Residues totaled an \n\nequivalent amount of 21.7 and 31.7 t ha-1 of dry mass, in treatments -B and +B, \n\nrespectively. As N source, we used a solution consisted of NH4NO3 and (NH4)2SO4 (19:1) \n\nin an equivalent dose of 200 kg ha-1 of N. The ammonium sulphate solution was enriched \n\nin 15N and provided a 10 % enrichment in the solution to be used as a mineral N tracer. N \n\nwas applied only once at experiment beginning.  \n\n The whole experimental unit (EU) of all replications were sampled five times \n\nduring decomposition, i.e. 0, 3, 6, 12 and 36 months.  At each time, 24 EU were collected, \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nsealed and transported to the lab, where residues were carefully hand-picked, stripped \n\nfrom any adhered mineral particles and taken to oven at 45 oC to obtain remaining dry \n\nmass. Soils were carefully separated in 0 -1, 1 -5 and 5 -10 cm layers, 2-mm sieved and \n\nair-dried to further analysis. For this study, residues from all sampling time were used to \n\nbuild decomposition curves, and soil analysis focused on 0 -1 and 1 -5 cm layers, of 12 \n\nand 36 mo., to investigate SOM dynamics. \n\n \n\n2.3. Soil analysis \n\n2.3.1. SOM fractionation \n\n2-mm sieved, air dried and free from visible plant material mineral soils from the \n\ntwo different depths studied here were physically fractionated in particulate organic \n\nmatter (POM) and mineral associated organic matter (MAOM) following a similar \n\nprotocol as described by Cambardella &amp; Elliott (1992). Briefly, 5 g of soil were dispersed \n\nusing 15 mL of a 15g L-1 solution of sodium hexametaphosphate and one small glass bed \n\nand shaken for 15 h at 200 rpm in a horizontal shaker. Afterwards, fractions were \n\nseparated by a 53 \u00b5 m sieve by gently adding deionized water until the flush through the \n\nsieve was completely clear. All the material and water that flushed through the sieve \n\n(MAOM) was recovered and taken to the oven at 60 oC until completely dry.  The material \n\nremained on the sieve (POM) was removed by rinsing deionized water again, recovered \n\nin a glass and also taken to oven at 60 oC until dry. This fractionation procedure results \n\nin no loss of any C fraction, as all the soil, dispersing solution and water is recovered, at \n\nthe same time that both fractions are thoroughly washed from the dispersing salt with the \n\ndeionized water used to get a complete fraction separation. After dry, POM and MAOM \n\nwere then weighted and finely ground with a ball mill for C, 13C, N, 15N and Py-GC/MS \n\nanalysis. \n\n \n\n2.3.2. C, ?13C, N and ?15N  \n\n No carbonate presence has ever been reported for the soils in the region where \n\nstudy is located, therefore all C content obtained in samples were considered to be organic \n\nC (MAPA 1973; Tornquist et al. 2009). Total C, 13C, total N and 15N were determined on \n\ndried and finely ground soil samples from both fractions using an elemental isotope ratio \n\nmass spectrometer (EA-IRMS GSL 20-20, Sercon, Crewe, UK). Reference gas was \n\ncalibrated with Pee-Dee-Belemnite (PDB) and atmospheric air N2 certified standards for \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nisotope signature calculations. The abundance in samples of 13C and 15N was calculated \n\nas follows: \n\n \n\n  ? ? \u2030 = (? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ) \u00d7                                            (1) \n \n\n  ?  \u2030 =5 (? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ) \u00d7                                            (2) \n \n\nwhere R = 13C/12C or 15N/14N ratios. \n\n \n\n Based on ?13C and ?15N obtained, we could calculate the proportion of C in each \n\nfraction that is derived from residues (fCHR) and the amount of N in each fraction that is \n\nderived from the fertilizer (fNm) as follows: \n\n \n\nfCHR=\n(? ? ? ? ?? ) (? ??? ? ? ?? )?                                      (3) \n\n \n\nwhere ?13Cf is the ?13C result obtained in each fraction, ?13CRef is the reference value, that \n\nwe adopted the ?13C of the treatments without residues (-R), fertilized or not, of each \n\nfraction, depending on the treatment compared, and ?13CHR is the average ?13C of the HR \n\nused. And \n\n \n\nfNm=\n(? ?5 . 66 ) (? ?5 . 66 )?                                     (4) \n\n \n\nwhere ?15Nf is the ?15N result obtained in each fraction for the treatments amended with \n\nN, 0.3663 is the reference value for N2 air, and ?15Nm is the enrichment of the solution \n\nused (10 %). \n\n \n\n2.3.3. Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry  \n\n Chemical composition of SOM fractions was analyzed using Py-GC/MS. We used \n\nsamples from time 0, 12 and 36 mo. to see SOM dynamics and chemical changes in the \n\ntwo fractions in order to test a pathway of litter transformation into SOC (Cotrufo et al., \n\n2015). Py-GC/MS analysis followed previously described protocols (Grandy et al., 2007; \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nRinkes et al., 2016). Briefly, samples were pyrolyzed with a CDS Pyroprobe 5150 \n\npyrolizer (CDS Analytical, Inc., Oxford, PA, USA) at 600 oC for 20 s and then transferred \n\nto a Thermo Trace GC Ultra gas chromatograph (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austin, TX, \n\nUSA) where they were separated on a fused silica column over the course of \n\napproximately 60 min with a starting temperature of 40 oC and final temperature of 310 \noC. Compounds were then ionized via ion trap on a Polaris Q mass spectrometer (Thermo \n\nFisher Scientific).  \n\n The Automated Mass Spectral Deconvolution and Identification System (AMDIS, \n\nV 2.65) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) compound library \n\nwere used to analyze and identify peaks. Peaks of each sample were expressed as relative \n\nabundance of total sample peak area. Py-GC/MS products were grouped into eight \n\nclasses, i.e. Aromatics, Lignin, Lipids, N-Bearing, Phenol, Polysaccharides, Protein and \n\nUnknown Origin.  \n\n \n\n2.4. Data analysis \n\nSuccessive sampling allowed us to estimate decomposition rate in treatments \n\nwith residues presence. Remaining mass at each time was used to fit the single \n\nexponential decay model (Olson, 1963) as follows: \n\n ? = ? ?                                          (5) \n \n\nWhere X0 = initial mass (%), X = remaining mass (%) at a time t, in days, and k \n\n= decomposition rate per day. The fitted model allowed us to estimate half-life (hl), in \n\ndays, i.e. the required to time to decompose 50 % of initial mass, of residues in each \n\ntreatment through the following equation: \n\n ? = ln /                                       (6) \n \n\nData were tested for normality with Shapiro-Wilk test and natural log or box-cox \n\ntransformed in cases where data for ANOVA did not meet normality assumptions. \n\nAfterwards, a three-way ANOVA was performed with Depth, Residues and N as main \n\nfactors, and all interactions, for soil SOM variables, and a two-way ANOVA with \n\nResidues (Bark) and N was performed to compare residues decomposition in the different \n\ntreatments. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nA multivariate description of Py-GC/MS products was performed using Principal \n\nComponents Analysis (PCA) to investigate their distribution and obtain a chemical \n\nfingerprint of SOM fraction at each treatment, depth and time. We calculated Euclidean \n\ndistance matrixes from the eight classes that Py-GC/MS products were grouped to create \n\nPCA plot. All analysis were performed with R 3.02 (R Development Core Team, 2013).  \n\n  \n\n3. RESULTS \n\n3.1. Decomposition \n\nBark notably reduced decomposition of residues (p<0.05), while Nitrogen \n\naddition had a tendency (p = 0.0663) to slow down HR decomposition (Fig. 1). +B \n\ntreatments showed an average hl of ~ 80 days longer than -B. +N presented an average hl \n\nof ~ 60 days longer than -N. +B had a higher influence in +N treatments, and N addition \n\nhad bigger effect in +B treatments, although N x Res. interaction was not significant \n\n(p=0.7999). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Decomposition curve of the different residues treatments during experiment.

ANOVA was performed \nwith estimated half-life values.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\n3.2. C content, ?13C, N content and fNm of SOM fractions \n\n All variables varied between the two-depth studied, except C:N ratio of both \n\nfractions (Table 3). Harvest residues (HR) and N had influenced SOM properties after 3 \n\nyr. of experiment. Changes in C content and ?13C were more expressive in 0 -1 cm layer \n\nand POM fraction (Fig. 2). Overall, HR presence increased C content and decreased ?13C \n\nvalues, indicating a higher fraction derived from HR in SOM. +B tended to increase HR \n\ncontribution, but its effect was more distinguished in -N treatments. Changes in N content \n\nfollowed similar trend observed for C (Fig. 3). +N showed higher N content in POM \n\nfraction than -N treatments, except in +B treatments where this behavior was not \n\nobserved. Contrary, +N resulted in smaller N content in MAOM than -N treatments. \n\nTherefore, C:N ratio \u2013 POM was higher in -N (13.65) treatments than +N (11.49) \n\ntreatments, and C:N ratio \u2013 MAOM was higher in +N (9.48) treatments than -N (9.07) \n\ntreatments. Mineral N fraction was always higher when HR were present, and even higher \n\nwhen bark was kept among residues. However, mineral N contribution to SOM fractions \n\nwas always smaller than 4 %. \n\n \n\nTable 3 \u2013 ANOVA results (p-value) of SOM fractions properties after 36 mo. of experiment.

Py-GC/MS of SOM fractions \n\nThe relative abundance of Py-GC/MS products summarized in the eight classes \n\nare presented in Table 4 (0 -1 soil cm soil depth) and Table 5 (1 -5 cm soil depth). Depths \n\nwere highly different in SOM chemistry (p &lt;0.001), so we organized their representation \n\nseparately to simplify the understanding of their dynamics (Fig. 4). The PCA plot \n\nobtained using these eight classes showed a clear separation of fractions inside both \n\ndepths and shifts in chemistry of fractions overtime (Fig. 4). Higher contribution of lignin \n\nto total chemical composition was observed in treatments with HR presence in POM \n\nfraction of 0 -1 cm depth, particularly when bark was present. In this layer and POM \n\nfraction, from 1 yr. to 3 yr., Lignin drecreased from 15 % to 7 %, and from 23 % to 15 \n\n%, in -R treatments, -N and +N, respectively (Table 4). When HR were present, it \n\nincreased from 16 to 23 % and from 29 to 32 %, in -N treatments, -B and +B, respectively. \n\nIn +N treatments, Lignin drecreased from 21 to 16 % and from 27 to 21 %, in -B and +B \n\ntreatmentes, respectively (Table 4). Despite little or no lignin contribution in MAOM \n\nfraction in 1 -5 depth (ranging from 0 to 2 %), Lignin seems to be driving the separation \n\nbetween MAOM 1 and 3 yr., basically due to native lignin disappearance in the 3 yr. \n\nsamples (Table 5).  \n\nLipid contribution is higher in POM of 1 -5 than in POM 0 -1 cm layer. In MAOM \n\nfraction, it seems to be similar between the two depths. Aromatics compounds increased \n\novertime in POM and decreased in MAOM fraction of both depths (ranging from 10 to \n\n18 %). Polyssacharides and Protein showed similar behavior overtime. They seem to \n\ndecrease in POM fraction overtime, while increase in MAOM, independently of \n\ntreatment. In MAOM 3 yr. samples of both depths, Polyssacharides were higher in -N \n\ntreatments, reaching more than 30 %. Protein peaked around 17 % in 3 yr. MAOM \n\nsamples in residues presence (Tables 4 and 5). Phenol compounds were mostly absent in \n\nour samples.  \n\nTreatments with N input (+N) showed a tendency of staying closer in MAOM 0 -1 \n\ncm depth, although a good separation of treatmens happened only in POM 0 -1 depth and \n\nit was due to HR presence, indicating a constant flow of HR input to this fraction (Fig. \n\n4). \n\n \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 \u2013 PCA plot of SOM fractions (white: POM; grey: MAOM) chemical composition based \non Euclidean distance matrix of the pyrolysis products grouped in the eight classes regarding their \nlikely origin.

DISCUSSION \n\n \nWe found a clear effect of residue mix on the decomposition rate (Fig.1). \n\nAlthough the mix composition of litter is known to influence decomposition behavior \n\n(Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2009; Vivanco and Austin, 2011), our results were the opposite from \n\nsimilar but broader studies of eucalypt harvest residues decomposition in Brazil (Ferreira \n\net al., 2016; Souza et al., 2016). Studying several sites in the country, the referred authors \n\nfound out that, overall, bark presence accelerated decomposition and nutrient release from \n\neucalypt harvest residues. Indeed, the site where our study is located had a peculiar \n\nbehavior when compared to the others (Ferreira et al., 2016). They hypothesized that this \n\neffect was due to the high nutrient content in bark, specially Calcium, and the probable \n\nhigher physical protection against any disturb when bark was present.  Our site is located \n\nin a subtropical area of the country and as it is a nutrient-rich soil, microorganism did not \n\nneed to scavenge the material for nutrients for their processes, so this could explain why \n\nbark slowed down decomposition here and elsewhere (Epron et al., 2006; Hern\u00e1ndez et \n\nal., 2009; Shammas et al., 2003), as it is a more complex material and presents a higher \n\nlignin and phenol content (Garc\u00eda et al., 2014; K\u00f6gel-Knabner, 2002). \n\nAs observed in the other sites, nitrogen effect on decomposition was not \n\nsignificant (Ferreira et al., 2016; Souza et al., 2016). However, +N here presented a trend \n\nto slow down decomposition, and its greater effect when bark was present, or the greater \n\neffect of +B in +N treatments, although not significant, might indicate a possible \n\ninteraction between the tannins present in bark and N, enhancing their toxicity and \n\nunpalatability to decomposers or by binding with dietary proteins and digestive enzymes \n\n(Coulis et al., 2009; Dong et al., 2016; Kraus et al., 2003; Makkonen et al., 2012).  \n\nHarvest residues (HR) had a positive impact on C and N of both SOM fractions, \n\nincreasing the content and C derived from C3 plants (Fig. 2 and Fig.3). Effects of HR on \n\nsoil C were higher on POM than MAOM fraction (Fig.2). +B particularly had greater \n\nimpact on -N treatments than on +N treatments. This could be a result of the slower \n\ndecomposition of this treatment, since there is less decomposed material \u201cready\u201d to \n\nbecome SOM. However, considering the proportion of SOM derived from HR, we \n\nnoticed a different behavior in -N and +N treatments, while changes in decomposition \n\nwere not that expressive, being another indicator of possible interaction between tannins \n\nand N, slowing down decomposition and reducing C transfer and stabilization. Moreover, \n\nthe reduction of +B effect on POM-N and MAOM-N content in +N treatments is \n\nintriguing. Changes in N of SOM fractions were similar to that happened to soil C. The \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\nlack of effect +N treatments in N content, although recovery of mineral N in SOM \n\nfractions (Fig. 3), might be explained by C:N ratio of our soils fraction. Ratios varied \n\nfrom 9 to 14. This narrow range is not likely to offer any constraint to microbial activity \n\n(Manzoni et al., 2010, 2008). Therefore, little +N effect on decomposition could either be \n\nattributed to the optimum stoichiometric range of our soil C:N ratio or the ability of \n\ndecomposers to decompose N-poor materials (Ferreira et al., 2016; Manzoni et al., 2008).  \n\nAlthough HR and N impact on soil C happened in both layers, they were more \n\nexpressive on 0 -1 cm soil layer. Sampling this thin layer is not usual and hard to do in \n\nfield experiments. However, the use of micro-plots allowed us to have better control of \n\nsampling process and better study the dynamics of C transference from litter to soil. Albeit \n\nthis layer might not be representative of soil C stocks and be too susceptible to impacts, \n\nit seems to concentrate the first steps of litter transformation (Cotrufo et al. 2015) and the \n\neffects on it might be reflected in deeper layers in smaller scales later (Figs. 2 and 3).  \n\nSeveral authors have studied the impact of eucalypt HR on soil properties (Epron \n\net al., 2015, 2006; Jesus et al., 2015; Kumaraswamy et al., 2014; Mendham et al., 2003; \n\nRocha et al., 2016). HR usually have a positive impact on soil physics (Jesus et al., 2015; \n\nSilva et al., 2007), as they protect the soil from compaction during harvesting operations; \n\nsoil chemistry, by increasing the amount of nutrients that remain in the field and thus \n\nnutrient cycling (Ferreira et al., 2016; Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2009; Laclau et al., 2010b); and \n\nsoil organic properties, helping to keep or increase soil C stocks (Epron et al., 2015, 2006; \n\nKumaraswamy et al., 2014; Rocha et al., 2016). Their effect on soil C is, however, highly \n\ndebated (Epron et al., 2006; Kumaraswamy et al., 2014; Mendham et al., 2003). Even \n\nthough several factors could affect soil C dynamics, especially when trying to see the \n\neffect of more lignified litter as HR (Magn\u00fasson et al., 2016), we hypothesize that this \n\ncould be a matter of soil sampling depth, as transference occurs first in a thin top-soil \n\nlayer, and the method used to measure soil C. Setting up the experiment in the beginning \n\nof a rotation allowed us to quantify the transference, as the gap between soil and residues \n13C signature was expressive and we believe the results here are quite representative of \n\nHR impact on SOM \u201cper se\u201d, any direct input from root was avoided using the micro-\n\nplots here described. Indirect contribution happened due to land use change, as ?13C of \n\ncontrol plots became more and more negative overtime (Table 2; Fig. 2). This \n\nconsiderable ?13C change in control plots highlights the difficulty of using isotope in \n\nperennial culture to study HR impact on SOM, as it could be hampered by the greater root \n\ninput during growth until HR become available (Binkley et al., 2004; Binkley and Resh, \n\n1999; Christina et al., 2011; Jourdan et al., 2008). Moreover, HR effects seem to happen \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\nfirst in the POM fraction (Epron et al., 2015), so measuring bulk soil C could prevent a \n\nbetter analysis of HR impact on soil C, especially because the major part of soil C is \n\nassociated with minerals, and effects on this fraction seems to be indirect or take longer \n\nto happen. A positive impact on SOC by HR, as seen here or elsewhere, should be \n\ninterpreted with careful, as it could be happening only in non-stable fractions of soil C. \n\nUsing a chronosequence (0, 1 and 3 yr.) of residue decomposition, we aimed at \n\nunderstanding the pathway of SOM formation, i.e. litter becoming soil C and stabilizing. \n\nWe tried to keep track by identifying similarities among SOM fractions with different \n\nturnover times, accessibility by microbes, and thus stability and role on soil processes \n\n(Schulze et al., 2009; von L\u00fctzow et al., 2007). Several authors have shown that SOM \n\nfractions have different chemistry and their formation processes are not the same \n\n(Buurman and Roscoe, 2011; Grandy and Neff, 2008; Schnecker et al., 2016). However, \n\nto our knowledge, we were the first to try this approach in a time scale. We hypothesized \n\nthat if POM was the first step of litter transformation and it would become a stabilized C, \n\n3 yr. MAOM chemistry would be similar to 1 yr. POM. That could not be seen by Py-\n\nGC/MS outputs (Fig. 4). It was seen that POM and MAOM are chemically different, and \n\ntherefore we infer they have different formation pathways. Analyzing together changes \n\nin C content and C transference (?13C) and Py-GC/MS, HR were an important source to \n\nPOM (higher lignin content), while MAOM was formed mainly by microbial products \n\n(Grandy and Neff, 2008). HR still had, however, some effects on MAOM, leading us to \n\nthink that HR have an indirect, but still crucial, role on C stabilization, since it is an \n\nimportant source of C and N for the POM fraction, and this is an important source of \n\nenergy for microbial community (Bradford et al., 2013; Cotrufo et al., 2013). Indeed, the \n\nimportance of microbial products to SOM under Eucalyptus ecosystems has been \n\nhighlighted elsewhere (Soares et al., 2013). \n\nOliveira (2015) showed significant changes in soil community in the same \n\nexperiment studied here through analysis of soil phospholipids fatty acids (PLFA) after \n\none year of experiment. Changes happened in the amount and proportions of different \n\nPLFA classes with HR management. HR removal resulted in increases in Gram + bacteria \n\nproportion, while HR presence increased the amount of PLFA and most likely microbial \n\nbiomass (Frostegard et al., 1996), raised the proportion of Gram \u2013 bacteria and bark \n\npresence caused an increase in Fungi concentrations. Changes were, however, not drastic. \n\nTherefore, changes in microbial products signature in MAOM fraction would take a much \n\nlonger time to be seen and might be seen clearer once there are constant input of litter and \n\nHR in following rotations. \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\nThe fate of lignin in soils converted to Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil is still \n\nunclear, either decreasing (Soares et al., 2013) or increasing (Santana et al., 2015) with \n\nafforestation.  Comparing initial lignin content of fractions and the differences in lignin \n\ncontent from POM to MAOM after 3 yr. of only litter input (Tables 2, 4 and 5), indicates \n\nthat root turnover and exudates inside aggregates may supply lignin to MAOM, and \n\nalmost no lignin is directly transferred from HR to stable fractions. The almost complete \n\nabsence in lignin of 3 yr. samples from 1 -5 cm depth of MAOM fraction (Table 5) points \n\nout to the fact that without a constant supply, lignin is not stable even associated with \n\nminerals. The idea that lignin is not that recalcitrant in soils has been growing lately \n\n(Klotzb\u00fccher et al., 2016; Lobe et al., 2002; Rasse et al., 2006; Thevenot et al., 2010). \n\nHowever, the idea that when associated with minerals it could remain in soils for decades \n\nstill persists (Dungait et al., 2012; Gaudinski et al., 2001; Rasse et al., 2006; Thevenot et \n\nal., 2010). Our data support the idea that may not resist even few years if there is no other \n\ninput (Grandy et al., 2007). \n\n \n\n5. CONCLUSIONS \n\nIn summary, we showed that more sustainable management of eucalypt HR, i.e. \n\nkeeping HR in the field, can enhance C sequestration in these forests. Eucalypt HR proved \n\nto be a significant source to particulate fraction of SOM and may be an important source \n\nof energy for soil microorganisms, driving microbial community dynamics (Oliveira, \n\n2015) therefore changing microbial products, chemistry of mineral associated fraction \n\nand C stabilization (Kallenbach et al., 2016, 2015). N addition, although less expressive, \n\nalters decomposition and reduce C stabilization of tannin-rich material (bark). SOM \n\nfractions chemistry differed each other, indicating distinct formation pathway for each \n\nfraction and different role on C cycle. Above-ground litter may not be a source for lignin \n\nin deeper layers and lignin may not be as stable as thought even associated with minerals.  \n\n       \n\n6.

CHAPTER 2 \n\nAssessing harvest and silvicultural systems effects on soil physical properties, CO2 \n\nefflux, soil C fractions and early tree growth in two Eucalyptus stands in Minas \n\nGerais State, Brazil \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n \n\nHarvesting and logging are probably the most impactful operations in eucalypt \nforest ecosystems and may define silvicultural operations needed for a successful \nfollowing rotation. Changes in soil physical properties are usually critic and may be \nreflected in soil CO2 efflux, soil organic matter (SOM) properties and plant development. \nIn this study, we aimed at understanding the effect of two different harvesting systems \n(Feller + Forwarder \u2013 F+F; and Feller + Skidder \u2013 F+S) on soil physical and organic \nproperties, soil CO2 efflux, and how these properties would be recovered and trees would \nrespond in two different silvicultural systems (Coppice or replanting). Hence, two \nhomogeneous and adjacent stands were selected and soil physical properties [Soil Bulk \nDensity (Ds), Micro (Mi), Macro (Ma) and Total Porosity (TP), and Penetration \nResistance (PR)] until 60 cm depth, SOM properties [Labile-C, C associated with \nParticulate (C-POM) and Mineral (C-MAOM) fractions] until 20 cm depth, soil CO2 \nefflux and stump mortality rate, were assessed after harvesting operations and compared \nwith reference (before harvesting). After harvesting, each stand was divided in coppice \nand replanting, and we followed soil CO2 efflux right after planting and one year later, \nwhen trees height (H) and SOM properties were also measured in both areas and system \nto evaluate how areas would recover from harvesting impacts. All soil variables were \nassessed at row and inter-row positions. Both systems affected soil bulk density and soil \npore configuration, but in different ways. F+F concentrates traffic at inter-planting row \nposition, and therefore caused a slightly higher compaction in this region, while F+S does \nnot follow traffic routes and impacted the planting-row similarly, resulting in higher \nstump mortality. Harvesting increased Ds, Mi and PR and reduced Ma and TP at all layers. \nEffects were more pronounced on superficial (until 20 cm) layers. Soil CO2 efflux was \nnot affected and presented similar values before and post harvesting. Differences in soil \nCO2 were found after planting, when it was higher in F+S system, that also presented \nhigher labile-C and C-POM, probably due to greater disturbance. One year after planting, \nmortality rate was still higher under coppice in F+S system, that also presented lower \ntrees. In turn, trees were higher in replanting in this area. Soil respiration behaved \nsimilarly, i.e., higher in F+F under coppice and lower under replanting. Changes in C-\nMAOM only happened one year after planting, where it was higher in coppice systems. \nOverall, after one year coppice system presented higher Labile-C, C-POM and C-MAOM \nand we could not attribute any differences to different harvest system. We conclude that \nforest floor removal by skidding operations does not seem to be harmful to SOM \nproperties in a single operation and SOM may take longer to respond to this intensive \nremoval. But different harvesting systems affect row and inter-row positions differently, \ncreating different soil functional zones, that might be enhanced by the next silvicultural \nsystem chosen, and should be observed when assessing ecosystem services and site \ncondition. \n\n \nKeywords: Eucalypt harvest system; soil compaction; soil respiration; soil organic \nmatter fractions. \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\n1. INTRODUCTION \n\nHarvesting and logging are among the most expensive operations in planted \n\nforests and the most impactful on soil physical properties. The possible soil degradation \n\ndue to traffic of heavy machines is a matter of concern regarding ecosystem functions and \n\nsustainability of future production. Mechanization of these operations is inevitable as it \n\nis extremely more efficient. With the advance of technology more powerful vehicles were \n\ndeveloped to meet productivity increases, but at the same time, it may increase soil \n\ncompaction due to heavier machinery carrying larger amounts of wood at a time (Horn et \n\nal., 2007, 2004; Vossbrink and Horn, 2004). Stresses due to compaction may be long-\n\nlasting or even irreversible and are usually concentrated on soil bulk density and porosity, \n\nthat are closely linked with soil and plant vital processes (Bottinelli et al., 2014; Cambi \n\net al., 2015). \n\nReductions in porosity and increases in soil bulk density because of compaction \n\nmay modify water and air flow in the soil, and therefore impact plant root development \n\nand soil biological activity. Decreases in productivity of subsequent rotations are often \n\nassociated with compaction caused by harvesting of previous rotations (Ampoorter et al., \n\n2011; Jesus et al., 2015). The extent of soil disturbance varies according to several factors \n\nsuch as machinery used, amount of wood logged, slope, number of passes in the same \n\narea, soil clay and organic matter content, soil compaction status and soil humidity during \n\noperation (Ampoorter et al., 2012, 2010; Cambi et al., 2015; Seixas and Souza, 2007; \n\nSilva et al., 2010). In summary, the more trafficked areas, the finer-textured soils with \n\nlow organic matter content, the lower soil bulk density and the farthest from optimum \n\nmoisture are the most susceptible conditions to harmful impacts.  \n\nClear-cut of Eucalyptus stands is usually done with Harvester + Forwarder (H+F) \n\nor Feller Buncher + Skidder (F+S) systems. The first is usually known as \u201ccut-to-length\u201d \n\nsystem, where each tree is harvested and processed in small logs individually, and pilled \n\nby the harvester, and then the forwarder is used for logging. It usually follows pre-defined \n\nroutes, concentrating the compaction in these areas, and all the non-commercial \n\ncomponents remain in the area, softening the impact direct to the soil and therefore \n\ndecreasing compaction. However, it is less efficient and compaction may increase with \n\nthe number of passes (Seixas and Souza, 2007). The second, in turn, is used in the \u201cwhole-\n\ntree\u201d harvesting process, where the Feller Buncher harvests a group of trees together and \n\npile them, and Skidder drags them to the edge of the plot where the tree is processed with \n\na harvester or a grapple saw. Albeit is a faster and lighter harvesting system, all the non-\n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\ncommercial residues and the forest floor are removed, which may have further \n\nimplications in nutrient cycling and carbon (C) budget (Achat et al., 2015; Epron et al., \n\n2015). Currently, the use of Feller Buncher + Forwarder (F+F) has risen trying to obtain \n\nthe most of both systems. Basically, the Feller would harvest a group of trees and pile \n\nthem, that would be processed inside the plot before being logged with the Forwarder \n\nfollowing the same track the Feller used. This system would create some \u201cresidues \n\nislands\u201d where the trees were processed, but the consequences still need to be studied.  \n\nAs said, the choice of the harvesting system may define harvest residue \n\nmanagement and therefore have directly consequences on soil C stocks. Although the \n\nimpacts on soil C may not be immediate or short-term, it could have significant mid-or-\n\nlong-term effect on carbon cycle (Achat et al., 2015; Epron et al., 2006), and therefore \n\naffect the role of these planted forests in climate change mitigation as recognized by the \n\n\u201cClean Development Mechanism\u201d of Kyoto Protocol. Hence, the use of SOM indicators \n\nthat are sensible to soil management, such soil CO2 efflux or labile-C (Goutal et al., 2012; \n\nHurisso et al., 2016), is needed to support management decisions. Likewise, the harvest \n\nsystem may define the silvicultural management adopted for the next rotation, i.e. coppice \n\nor high-forest (replanting), based on damage and mortality of strains. The silvicultural \n\nsystem would modify ecosystem resilience, since coppice would allow the system to \n\nrecover itself and replanting would require further operations such as subsoiling. Tree \n\ngrowth rates are different in both systems and tillage operations might accelerate recovery \n\nfrom compaction but at the expenses of breaking down aggregates, releasing stable soil \n\nC (Fialho, 2016; Nouvellon et al., 2008).     \n\nBased on this, we set up an experiment in two adjacent commercial eucalypt \n\nstands that were harvested with a Feller Buncher, but one was logged with a Forwarder, \n\nwhile the other was logged with a Skidder. After logging, areas were divided in coppice \n\nand high-forest managements. We measured soil bulk density, micro-macro-and-total \n\nporosity, penetration resistance, soil CO2 efflux, soil C fractions and initial tree survival \n\nand growth over 1 yr. to: (i) assess the effect of different harvesting system on soil \n\nphysical and organic properties and how could this changes affect soil CO2 respiration; \n\n(ii) evaluate how different silvicultural management change the resilience of eucalypt \n\nplantation harvested with different systems; (iii) evaluate how all of these management \n\ncombinations will impact on initial forest growth. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\n2. MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\n2.1. Study site and experimental design \n\nThe study was conducted in two adjacent eucalypt commercial stands in Estrela \n\ndo Sul, Minas Gerais State, Southeast of Brazil (19o01\u2019S; 47o40\u2019W), within the Cerrado \n\n(native savannah) domain. The two stands were selected based on homogeneity of \n\nprevious operation and productivity, soil type and properties. Selected sites were covered \n\nby forest plantations for the last 40 years. Cerrado conversion had started with Pinus sp. \n\nintroduction and changed to Eucalyptus sp. eight years ago. Last rotation averaged 44 m3 \n\nha-1 yr-1 of wood in both stands. \n\nSoil of areas were classified as Oxisol (U.S. taxonomy) and its properties are \n\npresented in Table 1. Both areas are considered flat, easy for any mechanical operations. \n\nArea is located in a tropical climate region (Aw, K?ppen classification), with dry winter \n\nand wet summer, and presented mean annual temperature (MAT) of 22 oC and average \n\nannual rainfall of 1410 mm during study years.  \n\n \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Soil site attributes before harvesting. \nArea Depth pH(1) Clay(2) Silt(2) Sand(2) Al3+(3) SB(4) \n\n cm - % mmolc dm-3 \nF+F 0-20 3.86 76 7 17 4.44 4.50 \nF+S 0-20 3.90 80 5 15 3.56 4.69 \n\n(1) Determined in CaCl2 0.01 mol L-1; (2)Determined following EMBRAPA (1997); (3)Determined \nin KCl 1 mol L-1; SB: Sum of Bases: Ca2+ + Mg2+ + K+ + Na+. \n\n \n\nBoth stands were harvested using a Feller Buncher (John Deere 903J), but logged \n\nusing different machines. One was logged with Forwarder (John Deere 1710D ECOIII, \n\n6x6) and the other with a Skidder (Tigercat 635D). Therefore, systems differ in logging \n\nand wood processing, as Feller+Forwarder (F+F) system has the wood processed inside \n\nthe area with a grapple saw, before loading the Forwarder, keeping all residues (leaves \n\nand branches and twigs) spread, while in Feller+Skidder (F+S) system the wood is \n\nprocessed in the edge of the area, also using a grapple saw, before loading the trucks, and \n\nit concentrates all residues in this edge area. \n\nAfter harvesting and logging, areas were divided in two silvicultural systems. Half \n\nof each area was conducted under coppice and the other half was conducted under high \n\nforest management, i.e. replanting. For replanting management, the inter-rows of area \n\nhalves were subsoiled until 60 cm depth. Standard fertilization was applied in both \n\nsystems and areas aiming at 45 m3 ha-1 yr-1 of wood yield based on NUTREECALC\u00ae \n\nsoftware estimations. Operations were all mechanized.   \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\n2.2. Sampling and data analysis \n\nAreas were sampled four times: before harvesting [(Pre) \u2013 Feb./14], after \n\nharvesting and logging [(Post) \u2013 Apr./14], after planting and fertilizing [(AP) \u2013 Jul./14], \n\nand one year after planting [(1 yr.) \u2013 May/15]. Sampling were done each time aiming to \n\nidentify changes in soil physical attributes, soil CO2 efflux, soil organic matter properties \n\nand plant growth. For each variable, sample occurred following different procedures that \n\nare detailed below. \n\n \n\n2.2.1. Soil physics attributes: Soil bulk density (Ds), Macro (Ma), Micro (Mi), \n\nTotal Porosity (TP) and Soil Penetration Resistance (PR) \n\n \n\nDs, Ma, Mi and TP were assessed before and post whole harvesting and logging \n\noperations. These properties were obtained through intact soil core samples collected in the \n\nplanting row and in the inter-planting row. At each sampling time, five replications were \n\nused for each position in each area. Soil cores were collected in four depths: 0 \u2013 10, 10 \u2013 \n\n20, 20 \u2013 40 and 40 \u2013 60 cm. \n\nMass and volume of soil core sampler were obtained previously. After sampling, \n\nsamples were tightly packed with a plastic film to avoid any possible loss of soil and sent \n\nto the lab. At the lab, samples were weighted to obtain current soil moisture content. Soil \n\ncores were placed in trays with water up to 80% of each soil cylinder height for 48 h to \n\ncomplete saturation. Afterwards they were taken to a tension table for 48 h with 60 cm of \n\nwater column pressure and then weighted to determine microporosity. Soil core were then \n\ndried at 105 oC until constant weight to obtain soil dry mass.   \n\nSoil particle density (Dp) was determined through the volumetric flask method and \n\ntotal porosity with TP = 1 \u2013 Ds/Dp equation. Macroporosity was determined by math \n\ndifference between TP and Mi. \n\nPR was evaluated before and post whole harvesting and logging operations \n\nsimultaneously with soil physics properties in a systematic way (Tavares Filho and Ribon, \n\n2008), at planting and inter-planting row, with 15 replications each. PR was also assessed \n\nin systematic way after replanting (only at replanted areas), but with 8 replications at four \n\ndistances (0.0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 m) from subsoiling line.  \n\nWe evaluated PR with an impact penetrometer (Stolf et al., 1983) until 60 cm depth. \n\nPR (MPa) was calculated using the following equation: PR = (5.6 + 6.89 N) x 0.098, where \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\nN is the number of impacts per decimeter of soil, proposed by (Stolf, 1991), considering \n\nthe penetrometer specifications. \n\nData from Ds, Ma, Mi and TP were submitted to a three-way ANOVA using \n\nSISVAR software (Ferreira, 2011), following repeated measures procedure with \n\nHarvesting System, Sampling Time and Depth as main factors. The effect of harvesting \n\nsystem and sampling time at each depth were compared through F test, and differences in \n\nsoil attributes among depths were assessed by Tukey post-hoc test at 5%. \n\n \n\n2.2.2. CO2 efflux \n\n \n\nSoil CO2 surface efflux measurements were done at the four sampling times \n\nevaluated. During the first two sampling (pre-and post-harvesting), sampling was carried \n\nout in 15 replications, following a systematic distribution across the two stands, at the \n\nplanting and inter-planting row. After silvicultural systems set up, i.e. two last sampling \n\ntimes, sampling occurred with 6 replications per system.  \n\nFor CO2 sampling, two static chambers placed at the planting (row) and inter-\n\nplanting row (inter-row) were used. Chambers consisted of 25 x 25 cm PVC tubes, \n\ninserted 5 cm into the soil, at least 24 h prior to the sampling. Chambers were closed for \n\n40 min and four sampling were performed during this period (0, 10, 20 and 40 min) to \n\nbuild the CO2 flux. Collects were performed with 60 mL syringe coupled with closure \n\nvalves that were stored under constant temperature up to 10 days until CO2 determination. \n\nSimultaneously to gas sampling, soil temperature and moisture were determined with \n\nsensor \u2013 data logger 5 TM (Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman, WA). \n\nCO2 concentration at each syringe was determined in a cavity ring-down \n\nspectrometer (CRDS, Picarro Sunnyvale, CA). Flux was calculated through the following \n\nequation: \n\n \n\n? = ?Q?t  ?  ? ? ?? ? ? ? ?  \n \n\nWhere fCO2 is the flux of CO2 (mg m-2 h-1); ?Q/?t: the slope of fitted regression \n\n(\u00b5 g g-1 s-1); M: CO2 molecular weight (g mol-1); P: pressure inside the chamber (1 atm \n\nassumed); V: chamber volume (dm3); R: molar gas constant (0.08205 L atm K-1 mol-1); \n\nT: soil temperature (K); and A: chamber basal area (m\u00b2).  \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\nAnalysis of data was carried out with two three-way ANOVA procedures. One \n\ncomparing the Harvesting System (Area), Sampling Time and Position (Row or Inter-\n\nrow) effects on soil CO2 efflux and the other comparing Area, Silvicultural System and \n\nPosition on soil CO2 efflux though F test. Box-cox and natural logarithm transformation, \n\nfor the first and second dataset, respectively, were necessary to meet normality \n\nassumptions. \n\n \n\n2.2.3. Soil organic matter properties: Labile C (Clab), Particulate Organic \n\nMatter (POM) and Mineral Associated Organic Matter (MAOM) \n\n \n\nSOM properties were assessed in three times of the four-sampling done: before \n\nand post harvesting, and one year after planting. At each time, a systematic sampling \n\nprocedure was adopted. Three composite (n=18) samples were collected before and post \n\nharvesting, while in the last sampling (one year after planting) three composite (n=12) \n\nsamples were obtained per silvicultural system, for each area at each depth and position. \n\nSOM was evaluated at 0 \u2013 10 and 10 \u2013 20 cm layer. \n\nLabile C was oxidated with KMnO4 0.033 mol L-1 following Shang and Tiessen \n\n(1997) procedure and determined in spectrophotometer at 565 nm. POM and MAOM \n\nwere determined by physical fractionation (Cambardella and Elliott, 1992). Briefly, 5 g \n\nof soil (air dried, 2 mm sieve) were dispersed with 15 mL of 5 g L-1 sodium \n\nhexametaphosphate solution by shaking for 15 h on a horizontal shaker. POM and \n\nMAOM were separated with a 53 \u00b5 m sieve by rinsing water and recovered in different \n\nglasses. Fractions were dried at 60 oC until constant weight and then finely ground. C \n\nassociated with each fraction was determined by dry combustion C analyzer. \n\n \n\n2.2.4. Forest Inventory \n\nWe started forest inventory after harvesting, when a survivor census of each area \n\nwas performed to complement soil physical data. One year after replanting/coppice, tree \n\nheight (H) and mortality were measured at plots previous established to assess harvesting \n\nand silvicultural systems effects on trees initial growth. 32 permanent plots were \n\nestablished in each area and system to evaluate annual forest growth. Areas and \n\nsilvicultural systems were compared through a two-way ANOVA using average tree \n\nheight and mortality obtained in each plot. \n\n \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n3.1.Soil physical attributes and Forest Inventory \n\nAreas were fairly homogeneous before harvesting operations, although area under \n\nF+F harvesting system presented higher density and microporosity, and smaller \n\nmacroporosity and total porosity at the inter planting-row area (Fig. 1). Both systems \n\naffected soil bulk density and soil pore configuration, but in different ways. Differences \n\nin traffic patterns could clearly be seen by different changes in soil physical properties. \n\nResults from undisturbed soil sampling and PR were convergent (Fig. 1 and 2). Both \n\nsystems affected planting and inter-planting row, being the last the most impacted. \n\nHowever, while F+F system concentrates its traffic on inter-planting row areas by \n\nfollowing pre-determined traffic routes, F+S system traffics throughout the area, \n\nimpacting planting-row region likewise. This could be more harmful depending on \n\nsilvicultural system adopted for the next rotation, as more strains could be damaged, \n\nincreasing the mortality rate (Ampoorter et al., 2011). The smaller damage caused to the \n\nstrains using F+F system (Table 2) seems to facilitate strains recovery, as a smaller \n\nmortality rate could be seen after one year under coppice (Table 3). In F+S area, almost \n\nno recovery could be seen after one year. \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1 \u2013 Soil density (Ds), Microporosity (Mi), Macroporosity (Ma) and Total Porosity (TP) \nbefore (Pre) and post (Post) harvesting at the planting (A) and inter-planting (B) row, in each area \n(F+F and F+S), for the four evaluated depths (0-10, 10-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm).

F+S caused higher strain mortality (Table 2). This was \n\nprobably due to major traffic intensity on planting-row, as could be observed by higher \n\nalterations on its physical properties (Fig. 1). One year after planting and fertilization, \n\ntrees were much higher in coppice systems. Trees under coppice were higher in F+F \n\nsystem, while replanted trees were higher in F+S (Table 3). Coppice systems also \n\npresented higher mortality. Mortality was higher in F+S system under coppice and did \n\nnot differ between areas in replanting systems.  \n\n \n\nTable 2 \u2013 Strain survival survey after harvesting in both areas. \n\nHarvesting system Area (ha) \nCensus \n\nTotal strains Alive strains Mortality (%) \n\nFeller + Forwarder 18.17 19440 16114 17.1 \n\nFeller + Skidder 20.07 21726 17149 21.1 \n\n \n \nTable 3 \u2013 Average height (H, m) and mortality (%), and standard error (n=32), one year \n\nafter planting in both areas and silvicultural systems. \nHarvesting System Silvicultural System H (m) Mortality (%) \n\nF+F Coppice 8.28Aa (0.09)  14.19Ba (2.04)  \n Replanting 4.87Bb (0.07)  7.03Ab (1.29)  \n\nF+S Coppice 7.96Ba (0.07)  20.31Aa (2.11)  \n Replanting 5.18Ab (0.07)  6.51Ab (1.06)  \n\nAverages followed by same upper case letter inside same silvicultural system and same \nlower case letter inside same harvesting system do not differ at 5 % by F test. \n\n \n \n\nTraffic increased Ds, Mi and PR and reduced Ma and TP at all layers. Effects were \n\nmore pronounced on superficial (until 20 cm) than deeper layers. Compared to before \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\ntraffic values, F+F caused the larger alteration in Ds, that was 16 % increase at inter-row \n\nin the 0-10 cm layer. At planting row, a maximum increase of 10 % was seen by this \n\nsystem at 20-40 cm layer. F+S, in turn, caused an increase of 13 % at planting row in the \n\n0-10 cm layer and 14 % at inter-row 10-20 cm layer. This magnitude of change is common \n\nin eucalypt (Jesus et al., 2015; Lopes et al., 2015; Silva et al., 2007) and other forest \n\necosystems harvesting (Ampoorter et al., 2007; Labelle and Jaeger, 2011), and \n\ncompaction usually happens in the top soil layers (Ampoorter et al., 2007; Dedecek and \n\nGava, 2005; Jesus et al., 2015). \n\nOther properties were, though, more affected. PR achieved ~ 4.0 MPa at the \n\nplanting row for both systems and ~ 5.0 and 7.0 MPa at inter-planting row for F+S and \n\nF+F, respectively. As summarized by Silva et al. (2000), these levels achieved in both \n\nsystems might constrain root growth, since values ranging from 1.1 to 5.0 MPa are \n\nacknowledge to affect root growth. For eucalypt, a mean value of 3.0 MPa is accepted, \n\nalthough other authors found values around 8.0 MPa after eucalypt harvesting and still \n\nobtained similar productivity to non-compacted soils in next rotation (Seixas and Souza, \n\n2007). After subsoiling, the subsoiling line returned to levels before harvesting (Fig. 3). \n\nHowever, surrounding areas that might be used for roots exploitation remained more \n\ncompacted and may be a matter of concern in F+S system, particularly when is observed \n\nhigh mortality rate and slower tree growth even after one year (Table 3), and this could \n\nstill be reflected in the end of the rotation (Dedecek and Gava, 2005). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3 \u2013 Soil penetration resistance at different distances (0.0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 m) from \nsubsoiling line in both areas. \u201cF + F\u201d indicates Feller + Forwarder and \u201cF + S\u201d indicates Feller + \nSkidder. \n\n \n\nPorosity is among the most important and sensitive indices to evaluate soil \n\ncompaction, since it is strictly related to water movement and soil aeration (Alaoui et al., \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\n2011; Berisso et al., 2012; Cambi et al., 2015; Kuncoro et al., 2014).  Mi and Ma were \n\nmore affected than Ds. A reduction of 87 % in Ma was observed in F+F system at inter-\n\nrow area in 0-10 depth (Fig. 1). This system also caused reductions higher than 50 % at \n\nthe inter-row in other depths but 40-60 cm, where it lowered Ma in 40 %. F+S system \n\nhappened to affect Ma more at the inter-planting row than the planting row. The biggest \n\neffect occurred in 0-10 cm layer and it was of 60 % of reduction. However, in the other \n\ndepths the reductions were all lower than 50 %, being only 7 % in the deeper layer. At \n\nthe planting row, in turn, F+S caused the higher changes in Ma. The highest decrease also \n\nhappened in the top layer and it was of 52 %. Decreases in the other layer ranged from 27 \n\n% to 36 %. In F+F system, the greatest reduction (42 %) was in the 20-40 cm layer. 0-10 \n\ncm presented 35 % less Ma after harvesting and decreases in the other layers were smaller \n\nthan 20 %.  \n\nThese reductions in Ma caused an increase in Mi, however increases were in a \n\nsmaller magnitude than Ma decreases. They were always smaller than 20 % and more \n\nconcentrated at the inter-row position. TP was also decreased, but were even in smaller \n\nmagnitude, usually around 10 %. We do not know to what extent this changes in soil \n\nporosity would affect water movement in our study soils. However, changes observed \n\nhere were as expressive or more than those found in other studies that related negative \n\neffects of compaction on soil environment and soil biological properties (Ares et al., 2005; \n\nCambi et al., 2015; Frey et al., 2009). \n\nOur results showed that compaction happened most in top soil layer. Some authors \n\nhave argued that sometimes this layer is not too affected due to its higher SOM content, \n\nwhich could increase aggregate stability and therefore soil elasticity, giving a higher \n\nprotection against compaction (Braida et al., 2008).  Hence, deeper layers would reflect \n\nmore compaction status due to traffic (Jesus et al., 2015; Silva et al., 2010). Indeed, the \n\ntop soil layer of our soils presented higher soil C content than deeper layers (Fig. 7). \n\nHowever, this higher C content also results in lower density and higher porosity (Cambi \n\net al., 2015), enhancing the susceptibility to compaction, since this layer is the one that \n\nreceives the heavy traffic impact before it could be dissipated to deeper layers. In our \n\ncase, this could also be highlighted due to almost total forest floor removal in F+S system \n\nand the non-continuous residues disposal in F+F system, that would increase the pressure \n\nover the soil (Ampoorter et al., 2007; Silva et al., 2007).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\n3.2. Soil CO2 efflux \n\n \n\nDespite affecting soil pore configuration (Fig. 1), harvesting and logging did not \n\naffect soil CO2 efflux (Fig. 4). Small changes happened, like increase in respiration in \n\nF+F system and higher inter-row respiration in F+S system. These changes were, though, \n\nnot significant. We hypothesized that reductions in soil porosity would result in reduced \n\nCO2 flux, since decreases in soil aeration could increase the production of other \n\ngreenhouse gases, such CH4 and N2O (Frey et al., 2011; Hartmann et al., 2014). Albeit \n\nthis could have happened, a possible increase in soil respiration due to disturbance and \n\nincrease SOM mineralization may have offset that and our measurement was not sensible \n\nto that. A small change but not significant could be seen in F+S system where inter-\n\nplanting row presented a higher respiration than planting row after traffic, probably due \n\nto greater changes in compaction of this system on this position. Also, average humidity \n\nranged from 25 % to 28 %, after and before harvesting and logging, respectively, and did \n\nnot vary between row and inter-row (Table S1). Considering the soil total porosity \n\npresented, we believe that was still enough space for aeration, therefore the compaction \n\nachieved may not be enough to hamper air flow. The possible change in pore \n\nconfiguration along the soil profile may have resulted in micro-sites where aeration \n\nshifted, however we could not detect that by measuring surface CO2 efflux. \n\nEffects of forest harvesting on soil CO2 are variable (Goutal et al., 2012; Yashiro \n\net al., 2008) and few are the studies addressing the effects of logging or soil preparation \n\nin eucalypt plantations (Epron et al., 2006; Fialho, 2016; Nouvellon et al., 2008).  Epron \n\nel al. (2006) observed decreases in soil respiration after clear-cutting the stand in \n\ncomparison to uncut stands. Fialho (2016), on the other hand, observed increases in soil \n\nCO2 efflux after harvesting. In such study, comparing Harvester+Forwarder (H+F) and \n\nFeller+Skidder (F+S) systems, it was observed that after harvesting soil CO2 efflux was \n\nhigher at inter-planting row, while F+S clearly stimulated CO2 efflux at the planting row. \n\nThe author argued that this response was due to disturbance and aggregate breakdown, \n\nreleasing protected carbon. In the present study, even with a high degree of changes in \n\nsoil physical properties, we could not see clear changes in the pattern of CO2 efflux. \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Soil CO2 efflux in both areas before (Pre) and post (Post) harvesting, at planting (row) \nand inter-planting (inter-row) row. Same upper case in italic inside same time and position, and \nsame upper case inside same area and position, and same lower case inside same area and time \ndo not differ at 5% by F test. \n\n \n\nRight after planting, respiration was higher in F+S area than in F+F, independently \n\nof the silvicultural system adopted. More labile-C and POM-C (Fig. 6) was available in \n\nthis area after planting, probably as result of the larger disturbance happened in the whole \n\narea and a small delay in the respiration could be captured in the next (after planting) \n\nsampling. Interestingly, subsoiling did not cause an immediate peak in respiration and \n\nrespiration was lower than reference or even after harvesting and logging. At that time, \n\nrespiration in coppice system was higher in F+S, while replanted areas presented a slight \n\nhigher respiration than coppice on F+F system, but no significant differences were found \n\nunder coppice or replanting, or between row and inter-row. As seen here, Nouvellon et \n\nal. (2008) did not see a clear effect of disturbing soil before planting on soil CO2 efflux. \n\nFialho (2016), in turn, observed increases in CO2 emissions at the subsoiling line.  \n\nOverall, soil CO2 efflux increased with time and one year after planting respiration \n\nreturned to before harvesting levels, or increased, as happened in F+F area under coppice \n\nmanagement (Fig. 5). Respiration in coppice areas were higher in F+F system \n\nindependently of sampling position, respiration in replanted areas was higher at planting \n\nrow in F+S system. We believe that a major part of this difference is heterotrophic \n\nrespiration due to plant development as it could be seen by trees measurement at the same \n\ntime, when bigger trees and smaller mortality were seen in F+F in coppice, compared to \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\ncoppice in F+S, and higher trees in replanting system were seen in F+S area, with similar \n\nmortality rates (Table 3). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5 - Soil CO2 efflux in both areas right after planting and one year after planting (1 yr. AP), \nunder coppice (Copp) or replanting (Repl) managements, at planting (row) and inter-planting \n(inter-row) row. ANOVA was run at each time separately. Same upper case in italic inside same \nsilvicultural system and position, and same upper case inside same area and position, and same \nlower case inside same area and silvicultural system do not differ at 5% by F test. \n\n \n\n3.3.Soil organic matter properties \n\nHarvesting operations usually resulted in decreases in labile C. (Fig. 6). This was \n\nnot observed only in F+S system at the planting row, where an increase in labile-C was \n\nseen. Particularly before harvesting, labile C was higher at the inter-planting row areas. \n\nF+F system impacted more negatively on labile C at the inter-row area. POM-C and \n\nMAOM-C presented similar behavior as labile-C. However, changes due to harvesting \n\nwere much less expressive in MAOM-C fraction. Harvesting effects on soil C are usually \n\nstudied following different harvest residues management and immediate or short-term \n\neffects are not expected in stable fractions (Cambi et al., 2015; Epron et al., 2006; Johnson \n\nand Curtis, 2001). However, labile fractions of soil C may be more sensitive and earlier \n\nindicators of disturbance. The possible breakdown of aggregates due to mechanical \n\noperations would release stabilized carbon inside aggregates, enhancing respiration and \n\ndecreasing soil C. Indeed, changes occurred mostly in more labile fractions. i.e. labile-C \n\nand POM-C.  \n\nOne year after planting, labile C, POM-C and MAOM-C presented similar behavior \n\n(Fig. 7). Contents were higher at the inter-planting row. At row areas, differences regarding \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\ndepth were less expressive. Coppice usually presented higher C content than replanted \n\nareas. Differences were more expressive at inter-planting row areas, where differences \n\namong depths were also highlighted. Expressive increases in POM-C were observed at \n\ninter-planting row one year after planting. At this position, higher MAOM-C was also \n\nobserved under coppice system. Significant shifts in MAOM-C was only observed at inter-\n\nrow position under coppice systems. Coppice systems presented the greatest amount of soil \n\nC overall and we argue that this is due to lesser disturbance and already stablished root \n\nsystem, which makes recovery faster and easier, and probably the higher contribution of \n\nroot system to soil C in these systems. Possible effects of harvest system and therefore \n\nresidue management on soil stable pool might only happen if the same management is \n\nadopted over consecutive rotations (Achat et al., 2015).   \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6 \u2013 Labile-C (A, B), POM-C (C, D) and MAOM-C (E, F) at planting (Row; A, C, E) and \ninter-planting (Inter-row; B, D, F) row, in both areas (F+F and F+S) before (Pre) and post (Post) \nharvesting, in the two depths (0-10 and 10-20 cm) studied. ANOVA was run separately in both \npositions (row and inter-row) evaluated.

ANOVA was \nrun separately in both positions (row and inter-row) evaluated. Same upper case in italic inside \nsame silvicultural system and depth, and same upper case inside same area and depth, and same \nlower case inside same area and silvicultural system do not differ at 5% by F test. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\n4. CONCLUSIONS \n\nCombining results from shifts in soil physical and organic properties, we could \n\nsee that different harvesting system affect differently row and inter-row positions, that \n\ncould drive the choice of next rotation silvicultural system, due to differences in survival \n\nrate after harvesting. F+F causes higher local compaction, but trafficked area is more \n\ncontrolled and limited to inter-row region. F+S, in turn, system traffics throughout the \n\narea, impacting planting-row region likewise, but in lesser extent, and may require more \n\ncareful recovery operations. Although expressive effects on soil density and pore \n\nconfiguration due to harvesting, soil CO2 efflux seems to remain similar, which indicates \n\nthat it is not a sensitive indicator to evaluate soil compaction status, since changes in soil \n\nphysical properties may need to be harder to shift soil respiration. Labile-C and POM-C \n\nchange rapidly and thus reflect management practices. Forest floor removal by skidding \n\noperations does not seem to be harmful to SOM properties in a single operation and SOM \n\nmay take longer to respond to this intensive removal. In summary, different harvest and \n\nsilvicultural systems create different soil functional zones, and soil preparation in \n\nreplanting cases enhance differences between row and inter-row areas, and should be \n\nobserved when assessing ecosystem services and site condition. \n\n \n\n5.

CHAPTER 3 \n \n\nNitrogen alters initial growth, fine-root biomass and spatial distribution, and soil \n\norganic matter properties of Eucalyptus dunnii plantation in Southern Brazil \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\n \nEucalyptus planted forests are expanding in Brazil and the effects of this land use change \nare still not fully understood. Particularly, nitrogen (N) fertilization effects on Eucalyptus \ngrowth and the effect of afforestation on soil carbon (C) are still controversial. We set up \na N fertilization experiment in Southern Brazil, a new frontier of eucalypt expansion over \nnatural grassland, to evaluate initial tree growth and changes in soil C. We also evaluated \nfine-root biomass (FRB), its spatial distribution and relation to tillage practices (ridge \ntillage) adopted there. Four N levels (24 \u2013 Reference, 36, 48 and 108 kg ha-1 of N) as \ncover fertilization, i.e. applied when trees were 1-year-old, were tested and tree growth \nwas assessed during the two first years. Afterwards, representative trees were chosen to \nevaluate FRB and its distribution, and soil samples until 40 cm depth were collected. Soil \nsamples were separated in 0 -10, 10 -20 and 20 -40 cm and soil organic matter (SOM) \nwas fractionated in Particulate Organic Matter (POM) and Mineral Associated Organic \nMatter (MAOM), and C and N content, and shifts in ?13C, were determined in these \nfractions. Positive effect of N on tree growth was highlighted right after fertilization, i.e., \n1.5 yr., whereas at 2 yr. N effects were seen only at trees height. Highest N dose resulted \nin higher diameter and height, but also higher mortality, therefore greater basal area was \nseen using 48 kg ha-1 of N dose. Increasing N until 56 kg ha-1 resulted in higher FRB, but \nafter that level FRB decreased and the highest N dose resulted in the lowest FRB \nobserved. N does not seem to drive fine-root spatial distribution, and both horizontal and \nvertical anisotropy in fine-root distribution were observed. Overall, afforestation had \npositive effects on soil C. Changes were more expressive in top-soil layers. 36 kg ha-1 \nresulted in higher C-POM in 0 -10, while 48 kg ha-1 resulted in higher C-MAOM in this \nlayer. C and N dynamics were tightly correlated, especially in MAOM fractions. ?13C of \nboth SOM fractions became more negative overtime, particularly of POM fraction. C-\nPOM was positively correlated with FRB. ?13C-POM was more negative with depth, \nwhile ?13C-MAOM became less negative with depth, but changes in ?13C-MAOM were \nnot significant. Tillage had a strong control on soil C and N stocks, enhancing C \ndeposition and turnover at row (ridge) region, most likely for favoring roots development \nin this region. In summary, we showed that N fertilization may alter initial tree growth, \nbut its effects do not seem to last longer. Nevertheless, N effects can be reflected on fine-\nroot biomass and C and N of SOM fractions. \n \nKeywords: Land use change; Nitrogen fertilization; Eucalyptus root system; soil organic \nmatter \n \n\n1. INTRODUCTION \n\nThe growing demand for forest products over the last years and the need for \n\ncleaner sources to mitigate increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations have increased the \n\nimportance of planted forests. Brazil is among the world\u2019s biggest sawn wood and pulp \n\nproducers, with highest average productivity. Planted forests cover more than 7.5 million \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\nhectares in the country and ~ 72 % of this area is dominated by Eucalyptus genus \n\nplantations (IB\u00c1, 2015). Southern areas in the country, particularly Rio Grande do Sul \n\nState, is a new frontier of Eucalyptus expansion and planted area in the state with the \n\ngenus has increased 68 % over the last 10 years (ABRAF, 2013; IB\u00c1, 2015). Most of this \n\narea is located in the only subtropical region in the country and special attention should \n\nbe given due to its particular characteristics (Alvares et al., 2013; Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2013).  \n\nLow temperatures and the risk of frost damage are probably the main concerns for \n\neucalypt development in the Brazilian subtropical region. Therefore, tolerance to these \n\nconditions is essential for a successful planting. Tolerance usually happens at the \n\nexpenses of a higher productivity. E. dunnii showed good adaptability to Southern Brazil \n\nclimatic conditions and is among the most planted species in the region (Floriani et al., \n\n2011; Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2013; Jovanovic et al., 2000). However, few are the studies \n\naddressing this specie in the region helping to find suitable managements to boost this \n\nspecie productivity as happened with other Eucalyptus species in other areas of the \n\ncountry to achieve current levels (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2008; Guimaraes et al., 2015; \n\nHern\u00e1ndez et al., 2009; Higa et al., 2000; Stape et al., 2010). \n\nThe current high eucalypt productivity in Brazil was achieved mainly due to \n\nimprovements in genetics and silvicultural practices. The relationship between \n\nproductivity and fertilization is well known in agriculture and this is not different in forest \n\nplantations (Stape et al., 2010, 2006).  Forest growth is limited mainly by N and P in \n\ntropical regions. However, the response of eucalypt plantation to nitrogen (N) fertilization \n\nis largely discussed and contradictory in the literature (Gazola et al., 2015; Gon\u00e7alves et \n\nal., 2008, 2004; Jesus et al., 2012; Melo et al., 2015; Pulito et al., 2015; Silva et al., 2013; \n\nSmethurst et al., 2004, 2003). Some authors have shown a clear response to N fertilization \n\n(Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2008; Jesus et al., 2012; Silva et al., 2013), especially on initial phases \n\nof growth (Pulito et al., 2015), while others showed no response to N supply, suggesting \n\nthat the organic mineralizable N is the main source and sufficient to support trees demand \n\n(Costa et al., 2005; Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2004; Versini et al., 2013). Regarding below-ground \n\ngrowth, studies are far more scarce associating N and root growth in eucalypt ecosystem \n\n(Jourdan et al., 2008). Nitrogen may also be important to sustain stable soil C formation, \n\neither by forming more complex compounds or increasing biomass input and turnover \n\n(Dijkstra et al., 2004; Moran et al., 2005; Neff et al., 2002).  \n\nIn Brazil, soil C stocks have presented different responses to afforestation (Cook \n\net al., 2016; Jesus et al., 2012; Lima et al., 2006; Santana et al., 2015) and might be \n\ndependent on prior land use, edaphoclimatic conditions, tree species planted and tillage \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \n\npractices adopted (Li et al., 2012). Studies assessing the effect of afforestation on soil \n\norganic matter (SOM) properties in Southern Brazil are scarce (Fialho and Zinn, 2014; \n\nSantana et al., 2015; Soares et al., 2013) and this is particularly necessary as expansion \n\nare often taking place over a fragile ecosystem dominated by sandy-textured soils prone \n\nto wind and water erosion (Roesch et al., 2009). As sustainability of Eucalyptus forests is \n\nhighly associated with SOM stocks, understanding the consequences of eucalypt \n\nafforestation on SOM of these areas is crucial (Barros and Comerford, 2002). \n\n  To investigate the effects of eucalypt afforestation and fertilization on initial \n\ngrowth and SOM properties, we set up a N fertilization experiment at the beginning of \n\nconversion of natural grasslands of Pampa Biome to E. dunnii plantations in Southern \n\nBrazil. We followed tree growth over the first two years, evaluating above and below-\n\nground growth, and assessed early changes in SOM properties by fractionation in \n\nParticulate Organic Matter (POM) and Mineral Associated Organic Matter (MAOM), two \n\npools with different turnover time and sensitivity to land use change (Cambardella and \n\nElliott, 1992; Lehmann et al., 2001), determining C and N content, and the proportion of \n\nC-derived from eucalypt (C3) using natural differences in 13C isotope, associated with \n\nthese SOM fractions.  \n\n \n\n2. MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\n2.1. Site description and experimental design \n\nThe study was located in Rio Grande do Sul State, Southern Brazil, near Brazil-\n\nUruguay border (30\u00b026\u2019S; 54\u00b031\u2019W). The site is within Pampa Biome, which is \n\ncharacterized by grass domain with many herbs and shrub species co-occurring with the \n\ngrass matrix. It is a new frontier of Eucalyptus plantation expansion in Brazil (IB\u00c1, 2015). \n\nSite is located in a sub-tropical climate area (Cfa, K?ppen classification), with mean \n\nannual temperature (MAT) of 18 oC and average annual rainfall of 1351 mm during \n\nexperiment years (Data from Brazilian National Institute of Spatial Research \u2013 INPE \u2013 S. \n\nGabriel/RS station, located at ~17 km away from experimental site at similar altitude). \n\nSoils were classified as Inceptsol (U.S. Taxonomy) and properties at the beginning of the \n\nexperiment are presented in Table 1. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Soil properties at the beginning of the experiment.  \n\nDepth pH(1) SB(2) ?b (3) Clay(4) \n          POM(5)        MAOM(5) \nC ?13C N C ?13C N \n\ncm - cmolc dm-3 g cm-3 % g kg-1 \u2030 g kg-1 g kg-1 \u2030 g kg-1 \n0-10 4.71 7.71 1.15 28 2.35 -14.75 0.14 19.22 -13.52 2.22 \n\n10-20 4.82 6.83 1.32 32 1.32 -15.74 0.07 14.37 -13.50 1.60 \n20-40 5.07 7.74 1.36 23 0.81 -16.11 0.03 10.79 -13.41 1.22 \n(1)pH determined in H2O, 1:2.5 soil:water solution; (2)Sum of Bases, Ca2+ and Mg2+ determined in KCl 1 \nmol L-1, K+ and Na+ determined with Melich-1 extractor.

Before planting, soil was subsoiled until 40 cm depth and then prepared in zonal \n\ntillage, i.e. ridge tillage management was used at planting rows. Overall, planting row \n\nconsisted of ~ 20 x 40 cm (height x width) ridges.  \n\nAt planting, 12 kg ha-1 of N were added as base fertilization. Using a randomized \n\nblock design with four replications, the stand was divided in four treatments (totaling 16 \n\nplots) that consisted of four N doses (Source: Urea), applied as cover fertilization one \n\nyear after planting: 12, 24, 36 and 96 kg ha-1 of N, totaling 24 (Reference, commercial \n\napplication used by forest companies in the area), 36, 48 and 108 kg ha-1 of N applied. \n\nEach plot contained 140 trees, divided in 20 trees for 7 different rows, occupying an area \n\nof ~ 1000 m2. \n\n \n\n2.2. Variables assessed \n\n2.2.1. Tree growth \n\nTrees measurement [Diameter at breast height (DBH) and Height (H)] started one \n\nyear (1 yr. age) after planting, i.e. right before the second fertilization, and were carried \n\nout six months (1.5 yr. age) and one year after (2 yr. age) second fertilization. For the first \n\nmeasurement (1 yr.), DBH and H of all trees were measured. For the two other \n\nmeasurements (1.5 and 2 yr.), DBH higher than 3 cm and H of the central 20 trees plus \n\ndominant trees (Hd) (Assman, 1970) were measured. Remaining H were estimated using \n\na hypsometric equation developed for each age. We tried the following models: Trorey \n\n(1932) and Curtis (1967), per treatment, and the generic models Campos and Leite (2006) \n\nand Scolforo (2005)  for all treatments combined. All these models have proven to be \n\nwell fitted to Eucalyptus plantations (Ribeiro et al., 2010). The best fitted equations were \n\nchosen based on coefficient of determination (R2), standard error of prediction (Syx) and \n\ngraphical residues distribution. Basal area (G, m2 ha-1) was calculated using obtained \n\nDBH, mortality rate and plot area.  \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\nDuring the 1.5 yr. age sampling, we also assessed leaf area index (LAI) of each \n\ntreatment and leaf N content. LAI was measured using a Li-COR LAI2000 plant canopy \n\nanalyzer. For each plot, 30 LAI measurements were obtained, simultaneously with the \n\nabove canopy light measurements that were done in an open field adjacent of the eucalypt \n\nplantation. Leaves from average tree of each plot were collected for leaf N content. They \n\nwere dried and finely ground before sulfur digestion for N determination by Kjedahl \n\nmethod. \n\n \n\n2.2.2. Fine-root biomass and architecture \n\n \n\nFine-root (\u00d8 &lt;2 mm) biomass (FRB) and its architecture were sampled at 2.75 \n\nyr. age, i.e. July 2015. After getting data from trees measurement, average representative \n\ntrees were defined for each plot and root sampling was taken on those trees. We selected \n\none average tree for plot, i.e. for each treatment and replication. Root sampling was \n\ncarried out in a quarter of each tree area. We sampled nine points in pre-defined locations \n\nbased on planting spacing for each tree until 40 cm depth, as almost 90 % of fine-roots \n\nare expected to be concentrated in shallower layers (Bouillet et al., 2002; Rodrigues, \n\n2013). Points were collected in three different directions: row (r), inter-row (i) and a \n\ndiagonal (d) at 45o between r and i axis, as shown in Figure 1. A 6-cm diameter auger \n\nwas used for sampling. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1 \u2013 Representation of sampling design used for a singular tree. Area shown represents \u00bc \nof total tree area.

Roots were stored in plastic bags and taken to the lab further cleaning, drying \n\nand weighting. Roots from one replication were stored in a 20 % hydro-alcoholic solution \n\nto keep its fresh properties. In the lab, roots were thoroughly washed, and fine-root were \n\nseparated from the others with a sieve and taken to the oven at 50 oC until dry to obtain \n\ntotal dry mass. Roots that were stored in the hydro-alcoholic solution were scanned at 300 \n\ndpi resolution before being taken to the oven. We processed root image with Safira \n\nsoftware (Jorge and Rodrigues, 2008) to obtain average length, average diameter, total \n\nsurface area and therefore specific root area (SRA). \n\n \n\n2.2.3. SOM properties \n\n2.2.3.1. C and N associated with SOM fractions \n\nSoil was collected at the same time as root sampling. Soil samples were randomly \n\ncollected in five points (n=5) per plot until 40 cm depth, divided in 0 \u2013 10, 10 \u2013 20 and \n\n20 \u2013 40 cm. Samples were then grouped and mixed to build a composite sample per plot. \n\nSamples were air-dried and 2-mm sieved before further analysis. We took a 5 g sub-\n\nsample for SOM physical fractionation (Cambardella and Elliott, 1992) in Particulate \n\nOrganic Matter (POM) and Mineral Associated Organic Mater (MAOM), and C, 13C and \n\nN content associated with each fraction were determined. Briefly, 5 g of soil were \n\ndispersed using 15 mL of a 15g L-1 solution of sodium hexametaphosphate and one small \n\nglass bed and shaken for 15 h at 200 rpm in a horizontal shaker. Afterwards, fractions \n\nwere separated by a 53 \u00b5 m sieve by gently adding deionized water until the flush through \n\nthe sieve was completely clear. All the material and water that flushed through the sieve \n\n(MAOM) was recovered and taken to the oven at 60 oC until completely dry.  The material \n\nremained on the sieve (POM) was removed by rinsing deionized water again, recovered \n\nin a glass and taken to oven at 60 oC until dry.  \n\n After dry, POM and MAOM were then weighted and finely ground with a ball \n\nmill for C, 13C and N content determination using an elemental isotope ratio mass \n\nspectrometer (EA-IRMS GSL 20-20, Sercon, Crewe, UK). Reference gas was calibrated \n\nwith Pee-Dee-Belemnite (PDB) certified standard for isotope signature calculations. The \n\nabundance in samples of 13C was calculated as follows: \n\n \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\n  ? ? \u2030 = (? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ) \u00d7                                            (1) \n  \n\nwhere R = 13C/12C ratio. \n\n \n\n2.2.3.2. Litter and tillage effects on SOM properties \n\n Inside the smallest dose treatment (24 kg ha-1 of N \u2013 Reference) area, a central \n\narea occupied by 9 trees (~ 65 m2) was permanently covered with a net (0.5-mm mesh) \n\nto avoid litter input to the soil. Net was cleaned every month and fallen litter was taken \n\nto the lab where it was dried and weighted to obtain litter input rates. Soil was collected \n\ninside this area in three different points (n=3) until 40 cm depth, then grouped and mixed \n\nto make one composite sample per replication. C and N content and ?13C associated with \n\nSOM fractions were obtained using the same procedure described above. We compared \n\nthese data with those obtained from areas not covered with the net inside the same \n\ntreatment. \n\n Soil samples were also collected inside reference dose plots at the planting row \n\nand inter-planting positions to evaluate any tillage effect on SOM properties. Five \n\nsamples (n=5) until 40 cm depth were collected per position to form one composite \n\nsample for each position for each replication. The same SOM fractionation procedure and \n\nC, N and ?13C content determination described previously were adopted to see any tillage \n\neffect on SOM properties. \n\n \n\n2.3. Data analysis  \n\n Data was checked for normality and homoscedasticity for each variable and ln-\n\ntransformed in necessary cases to meet normality assumptions. We fitted linear \n\nregressions for each sampling time to see increasing N fertilization effects on tree growth \n\n(DBH, H, LAI) and root biomass. Two-way ANOVA and post-hoc Student LSD test were \n\nused for all tree variable and SOM properties. A correlation between above and below-\n\nground tree variables with SOM properties was also performed. \n\n Spatial distribution of fine-roots across horizontal and vertical layers was \n\nrepresented using ordinary kriging of fine-root density (FRD). This method smoothes root \n\ndistribution representation, by estimating FRD in areas where roots were not measured, \n\nbased on the semi-variogram of variances of measured data, considering distance and \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\ndirection of obtained data. The semi-variogram model was adjusted according to the \n\nnormality, stationarity, tendency and anisotropy of the samples, and its fitness was \n\nevaluated by a cross validation technique. All analysis were carried out in SISVAR\u00ae and \n\nR 3.02 software (Ferreira, 2011; R Development Core Team, 2013). \n\n \n\n3. RESULTS \n\n3.1. Tree growth \n\nTrees presented similar growth pattern before cover fertilization (Fig. 2). \n\nDifferences in DBH and H were not significant until 1.5 yr., when a positive effect of N \n\nfertilization on growth was seen. Differences were higher at 1.5 yr., whereas at 2 yr. \n\ndifferences could be seen only for H. A clear change in slope due to fertilization could be \n\nseen at growth curves. The highest N dose resulted in higher mortality, which explains \n\nthe lower G, even with higher average DBH, than 48 kg ha-1 of N dose. These differences \n\nwere though not significant. An increase in leaf N content and LAI could be seen with \n\nincreasing N dose, however increases were also not significant at 5 % of probability \n\n(Table 2). \n\n \n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Eucalyptus tree average diameter at breast height (DBH, cm) and height (H, m) as a \nfunction of N level.

Fine-root biomass (FRB) and spatial distribution \n \n\nFine-root biomass responded positively until ~ 60 kg ha-1 of N. After this dose, \n\nincreasing N addition reduces FRB until 40 cm depth (Fig. 3). This behavior is a result of \n\na positive impact of N availability on root growth until the third highest dose used, but \n\nthe lowest root biomass was found at the highest N dose applied. \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Fine root biomass (FRB) until 40 cm depth at 2.75 yr. as affected by N fertilization. ** \nindicates parameter is significant at 5 %. \n \n\n \n\n Tillage changed root distribution along soil surface and profile (Fig. 4). Fine-root \n\ndensity showed a high heterogeneity along soil profile, and there was horizontal and \n\nvertical anisotropy in root distribution. Root spatial distribution varied in the different N \n\ndoses tested and in the different regions. FRD seems to increase along soil profile at \n\nplanting row, particularly due to 20 cm ridges created. Inter-row and diagonal position \n\npresented a \u201cmore natural\u201d behavior, i.e. higher root density in soil top layers (Bouillet et \n\nal., 2002; Grant et al., 2012; Laclau et al., 2001; Louren\u00e7o, 2009; Rodrigues, 2013). \n\nOverall, in these two last position the highest root concentration happened in 10 -20 cm \n\nlayer. This is particularly interesting due to the higher soil density of this layer in \n\ncomparison with top-soil (Table 1). That is probably the reason why more roots could be \n\nfound at planting row position below 20 cm depth.  \n\n \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Kriging interpolation of average fine-root density (FRD) distribution along soil profile \nin the three positions evaluated.

DBH and \n\nH correlated negatively with FRB and positively with SRA. SOM properties had little or \n\nno correlation with aboveground variables (DBH, H). In turn, C-POM correlated \n\npositively with FRB and therefore negatively with SRA. C-MAOM only correlated with \n\nroot length.

C and N associated with SOM fractions as affected by N level, litter presence \n\nand tillage \n\nNitrogen had influence on C associated with POM and MAOM, particularly in \n\nthe 0 -10 cm soil layer. This influence was, though, non-linear and different between \n\nfractions (Table 4). 36 kg ha-1 of N resulted in the highest C-POM at 0 -10 cm layer. At \n\n10 -20 cm layer, highest C-POM was found at 48 kg ha-1 of N dose. This dose also resulted \n\nin the highest C-MAOM in 0 -10 cm layer and N-MAOM in 10 -20 cm layer. In general, \n\n48 kg ha-1 of N was the dose that provided higher C and N contents. Increasing N dose \n\nhad no effect on ?13C values of SOM fractions. ?13C-POM became more negative as it \n\ngets deeper, whilst ?13C-MAOM presented small and non-significant differences among \n\ndepths and treatments. \n\nTable 4 \u2013 N fertilization effects on C, ?13C and N of SOM fractions properties at 2.75 yr. eucalypt \nplantation.  \n\nProperties \nNitrogen dose (kg ha-1) \n\n24 36 48 108 \nC-POM (g kg-1)    \n\n0-10 4.23Ba (0.87) 7.55Aa (0.65) 4.88ABa (1.16) 4.30Ba (0.52) \n10-20 1.56Bb (0.48) 1.99ABb (0.52) 2.82Ab (0.76) 1.90ABb (0.28) \n20-40 0.70Ac (0.14) 0.85Ac (0.09) 0.61Ac (0.04) 0.67Ac (0.08) \n\nC-MAOM (g kg-1)    \n\n0-10 18.66Cc (1.38) 21.72Ba (1.74) 27.44Aa (1.14) 20.41BCa (0.64) \n10-20 15.36Ab (1.67) 16.92Ab (1.32) 16.12Ab (1.35) 17.46Ab (1.39) \n20-40 9.69Ac (0.83) 11.09Ac (0.96) 11.51Ac (0.09) 9.05Ac (1.31) \n\n?13C-POM (\u2030)     \n0-10 -15.77Ac (0.31) -15.78Ab (0.41) -16.35Ab (0.89) -16.56Ab (0.36) \n\n10-20 -17.33Ab (0.34) -16.93Aa (0.36) -16.62Ab (0.58) -17.25Aab (0.26) \n20-40 -18.34Aa (0.16) -17.63Aa (0.29) -17.78Aa (0.36) -17.70Aa (0.23) \n\n?13C-MAOM (\u2030)    \n0-10 -13.37Aa (0.11) -14.29Aa (0.28) -14.46Aa (0.35) -14.19Aa (1.05) \n\n10-20 -14.24Aa (0.06) -14.20Aa (0.26) -14.10Aa (0.43) -13.71Aa (1.24) \n20-40 -13.19Aa (0.97) -13.77Aa (0.20) -13.67Aa (0.53) -14.06Aa (0.66) \n\nN-POM (g kg-1) \n0-10 0.30Aa (0.06) 0.48Aa (0.12) 0.41Aa (0.05) 0.31Aa (0.04) \n\n10-20 0.09Bb (0.03) 0.13ABb (0.03) 0.19Ab (0.05) 0.12ABb (0.02 \n20-40 0.03Ac (0.01) 0.04Ac (0.00) 0.04Ac (0.01) 0.03Ac (0.00) \n\nN-MAOM (g kg-1) \n0-10 1.96Ba (0.16) 2.28Ba (0.19) 2.69Aa (0.32) 2.14Ba (0.07) \n\n10-20 1.62Aa (0.17) 1.75Ab (0.17) 1.69Ab (0.16) 1.82Aa (0.15) \n20-40 0.97Ab (0.12) 1.13Ac (0.10) 1.18Ac (0.03) 0.91Ab (0.03) \n\nStandard errors (n=4) are presented inside parenthesis.

DISCUSSION \n\n4.1. Tree growth \n\n Eucalypt growth response to N has been largely debated. Mineralizable N and the \n\nefficient internal N cycling are considered to suffice their fast growth (Gama-Rodrigues \n\nand Barros, 2002; Laclau et al., 2010). Seldom responses of eucalypt growth to N \n\nfertilization are found in literature and they are usually limited to the two first years, while \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n\ncanopy is still in formation or under N limiting situations (Gazola et al., 2015; Gon\u00e7alves \n\net al., 2008; Jesus et al., 2012; Melo et al., 2015; Pulito et al., 2015; Silva et al., 2013; \n\nSmethurst et al., 2004, 2003). Here, tree growth responded positively to N fertilization \n\nduring the two years evaluated. N effects on growth was greater at 1.5 yr. age, i.e. six \n\nmonths after cover fertilization and treatment application, when DBH and H were \n\npositively influenced by N (Fig. 2). At 2 yr., only H was positively influenced.  \n\nThe highest N dose resulted in the highest LAI and leaf N content, although not \n\nsignificant, which could explain this higher growth (Table 2). Albeit differences in \n\neucalypt LAI and leaf nutrient content due to fertilization may respond in lower extent \n\nthan growth (Melo et al., 2015), they are considered good indicators of continuous forest \n\ngrowth (Albaugh et al., 2004; Jesus et al., 2012; Smethurst et al., 2003; Stape et al., 2004). \n\nLAI smaller than 3 m2 m-2 as found here have already been reported for eucalypt tropical \n\nplantations (Binkley et al., 2002; Smethurst et al., 2003), but it still considered a low LAI \n\nand is expected to increase as LAI tends to peak when eucalypt forest is around 4-year-\n\nold (Beadle, 1997).  \n\n \n\n4.2.Root biomass and spatial distribution \n\nThe highest N dose also resulted in the lowest root biomass (Fig. 3). All trees \n\nsampled for roots were not located side by side with dead trees, so it is more likely that \n\nthe lower FRB found here is at least in part responsible for the higher mortality, even \n\nthough support trees on the soil is not the major function of fine-roots. Considering the \n\nsite soil is a shallow Inceptsol with higher density in deeper layers (Table 1), a well-\n\ndeveloped lateral root system would be essential to protect trees against wind. Whilst \n\ncoarse roots are mainly located near the stump, fine and medium roots spread laterally \n\nand have good biomass and distribution correlation (Laclau et al., 2013, 2001; Teixeira \n\net al., 2002), and may be helping lateral support of those trees, especially because roots \n\nuntil 2-mm \u00d8 were sampled here.  \n\nThe high nutrient availability may have resulted in needless root expansion under \n\nthe highest dose. In contrast to what we found here, Jourdan et al. (2008) found no effect \n\nof N fertilization on fine root growth of Eucalyptus grandis plantations in Brazil. They \n\nused a 120 kg ha-1 N dose and found negligible differences in FRB in the first 0 -30 cm \n\nof soil compared to control (0 kg ha-1 of N). Fabi\u00e3o et al. (1995) also found no differences \n\nin fine root eucalypt production due to fertilization or irrigation. Coarse roots and total \n\nbelow-ground biomass, in turn, were affected by their treatments.  \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \n\nAs fine roots are specialized in acquiring water and nutrient, other variables such \n\nas length and SRA may be as or more important than total amount of FRB. Indeed, mean \n\ncorrelations showed that specific root area was positively correlated with tree growth \n\n(Table 3). FRB was negatively correlated with tree growth. This mean result needs to be \n\nevaluated carefully, as it was mostly obtained due to root behavior under 108 kg ha-1 of \n\nN dose, since FRB, DBH and H increased with increasing N in the smaller doses. So, we \n\ndo not argue that N was limiting and trees had to choose where to allocate C.  \n\nAs observed in other studies with eucalypt roots distribution, a horizontal and \n\nvertical anisotropy was observed (Bouillet et al., 2002; Laclau et al., 2013, 2001), and \n\nthis might have resulted in some fine-root clustering (Fig. 4).  Root spatial distribution \n\npresented a strong behavior driven by ridge tillage. Although this tillage control, total \n\namount of FRB found here are in agreement to other studies that adressed eucalypt roots \n\nof similar age plantations (Fabi\u00e3o et al., 1995; Jourdan et al., 2008; O\u2019Grady et al., 2005) \n\nor older (Teixeira et al., 2002; Witschoreck et al., 2003). This indicate that eucalypt fine \n\nroot biomass may stabilize in certain age and vary in different seasons due to their rapid \n\nturnover (Jourdan et al., 2008; K\u00e4tterer et al., 1995; Mello et al., 2007; Teixeira et al., \n\n2002). \n\nOverall, eucalypt fine roots tend to concentrate in shallower layers, and sharply \n\ndecrease with depth (Bouillet et al., 2002; Laclau et al., 2001; Louren\u00e7o, 2009; Rodrigues, \n\n2013; Teixeira et al., 2002; Witschoreck et al., 2003). Here, roots growing on the ridge \n\nincreased with depth. At planting row position, soil was subsoiled and a ridge of ~ 20 cm \n\nheight was created that might have driven and changed pattern of root distribution. \n\nMoreover, trees probably invested in deeper roots in ridge area due to the elevated density \n\nin surrounding areas. In the other positions, FRD peaked in 10 -20 cm layer and then \n\ndecreased. This is probably a result of obstructions found in deeper layers as plinthite and \n\nother cohesive structure formations were observed. Although differences in FRB among \n\nN-levels were observed, we could not see a pattern of root distribution being driven by N \n\nfertilization. \n\n \n\n4.3. SOM properties as affected by N levels, litter and tillage \n\n Nitrogen had influence on C associated with POM and MAOM, particularly in the \n\n0 -10 cm soil layer. C and N associated with SOM fractions presented similar responses \n\nto N fertilization regimes, although effect on N content was less expressive (Table 4). \n\n\n\n72 \n\n \n\nTheir dynamics was tightly correlated (Li et al., 2012), particularly when associated with \n\nmineral soil fraction (Table 3).  \n\n Overall, eucalypt afforestation resulted in C and N accrual when compared to \n\nprevious land use. Accrual happened in the top soil layer, especially in POM fractions \n\nand noteworthy for N-POM, whereas deeper layer (20 -40 cm) remained unchanged or \n\npresented lower C and N content. Both ?13C-POM and ?13C-MAOM became more \n\nnegative, with ?13C-POM changing faster.  Interestingly, while top soil layers presented \n\nhigher C-POM content with eucalypt afforestation, it also presented a less negative ?13C-\n\nPOM. This could be a dilution effect, since a slightly decrease of C-POM in 20 -40 cm \n\nlayer was observed, but at the same time more eucalypt contribution (more negative ?13C) \n\nwas observed (Table1; Table 4). This is an evidence that fresh root input may destabilize \n\nold deep soil C (Fontaine et al., 2007), and the overall lower root growth and slower \n\nturnover in deeper layer can explain this decrease of C-POM in deeper layers, since FRB \n\nwas positively correlated with C-POM (Table 3).  \n\n Afforestation effects on soil C is largely debated in the literature (Binkley et al., \n\n2004; Binkley and Resh, 1999; Li et al., 2012; Lima et al., 2006; Santana et al., 2015). \n\nThe positive effect of N on soil C pools showed here are in disagreement with some other \n\nauthors who found no effect of N fertilization on soil C pools under eucalypt plantations \n\n(Binkley et al., 2004; Jesus et al., 2012). Binkley et al. 2004 tested much higher N doses \n\n(300 \u2013 1600 kg ha-1 of N) on development of first-rotation eucalypt forest in Hawaii and \n\nfound no evidence of N altering soil C accrual because losses of old C4-derived C offset \n\nC3-derived C inputs throughout an 8-year rotation. Here, at 2.75 yr. rotation we observed \n\na positive effect of N particularly with 36 kg ha-1 and 48 kg ha-1 of N doses for C-POM \n\nand C-MAOM, respectively. Although this behavior might change until the end of \n\nrotation, we hypothesize that effects might be even enhanced, since a nutrient-richer \n\ncycling is expected (Silva et al., 2013) and therefore a positive effect of combined mineral \n\nand organic N on soil C pools (Moran et al., 2005). \n\n Litterfall exclusion had no effect on soil C and N, although some minor changes \n\ncould be observed. Eucalypt litterfall influence on soil C is poorly studied thus making \n\ndifficult any comparison. Litter might have a positive influence on soil C, but it should \n\nbe restricted to the very top-soil layer (Cotrufo et al., 2015; Souza, 2012) and the 0 -10 \n\ncm sampling used here may have hampered any possible litter effects. Litterfall \n\nproduction tends to peak when eucalypt forest is around 4-year-old (Nouvellon et al., \n\n2012) and may achieve up to 8 Mg ha-1 in a single year (Cizungu et al., 2014; Corr\u00eaa et \n\nal., 2013; Inkotte et al., 2015). The amount of litterfall produced here was around 3.7 Mg \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \n\nha-1 yr-1. Hence, it may even double the amount of litter entering the soil and the constant \n\ninput throughout a rotation might alter SOM dynamics and differ from what we found \n\nhere. \n\n Differently of litterfall exclusion influence on SOM properties, the adoption of \n\nridge tillage notably altered soil C and N pools. It might be a consequence of changing \n\nroot distribution (Fig. 4) and likely breakdown of soil aggregates, changing temperature, \n\nhumidity and therefore C and N accrual and turnover (Fialho, 2016; Oliveira, 2015; \n\nWilliams et al., 2016a, 2016b). Higher C content was observed in row position in both \n\nPOM and MAOM fractions and differences were remarkable especially in 0 -10 cm layer \n\n(Table 5). It also resulted in more eucalypt-derived C, with significant differences in the \n\ndeeper layer (20 -40 cm), that is probably the consequence of the higher fine-root biomass \n\nand turnover. This result shows that adoption of a zonal management technique such ridge \n\ntillage is likely to create different functional zones in the area and therefore drive \n\necosystem functioning. \n\n \n\n5. CONCLUSIONS \n\nOur results showed that N fertilization alters tree growth and SOM fractions \n\nproperties. A positive change in the slope of growth curve with N addition was observed, \n\nbut differences do not seem to last longer. This indicate that a yearly N supply may be the \n\nbest approach to enhance forest productivity over Inceptsols in Southern Brazil, at least \n\nduring the first years. Differences in SOM fractions properties due to N fertilizations were \n\nhigher, but non-linear, and were correlated with fine-root biomass production and \n\nturnover. Most of soil C eucalypt-derived came from roots, with negligible effects of litter \n\ninput. Zonal tillage management, i.e. ridge tillage management adopted here, had \n\nsignificant influence on soil C and N, probably due to changes in soil aggregation, \n\naeration, temperature and humidity and to be driving root distribution along soil surface \n\nand profile. The best results were achieved with slightly increases (12 and 24 kg ha-1 of \n\nN) in reference dose (24 kg ha-1), being the 48 kg ha-1 of N the dose that resulted in higher \n\nstand basal area, fine-root biomass and stable C and N, indicating that it is probably the \n\nmost suitable one to be used under the evaluated conditions. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n74 \n\n \n\n6.

FINAL CONSIDERATIONS \n\n \nThis thesis tried to approach some existing gaps regarding the impact of forest \n\noperations on soil physical and organic properties, and early stand status in planted \n\nEucalyptus plantations in Brazil. We hope that results found here can be used to guide \n\nmore accurate decisions regarding sustainability of eucalypt plantation, particularly in \n\nforest expansion areas where studies are still scarce.  \n\nIn summary, it is shown that: \n\n- Harvest residues (HR) sustainable management could enhance soil C stocks and \n\ndirectly alter soil organic matter (SOM) particulate fraction chemistry. HR are could also \n\nbe an important energy source for soil microorganisms and therefore increase C \n\nsequestration in SOM stable pools. HR directly effects are, however, restricted to the very \n\ntop-soil layer; \n\n - The choice of harvesting system and next rotation silvicultural system should be \n\ndone together, since harvesting impacts vary from system to system and might be harmful \n\nfor next rotation development, requiring specific silvicultural techniques to grant forest \n\nsuccess. Different harvest and silvicultural system might create different soil functional \n\nzones, enhancing differences between row an inter-row areas, that shall be observed when \n\nevaluating operations impacts; \n\n - Lastly, it\u2019s shown positive although short impacts of N fertilization on initial \n\ngrowth of Eucalyptus trees in a new forest expansion area in the country. N addition had \n\nalso positive effects on fine-root biomass and C and N content of SOM fractions. Hence, \n\nthe use of slightly higher N doses than the ones adopted currently may be beneficial. C \n\nand N content were positively correlated with fine-root biomass. Litter input had no effect \n\non SOM properties. Planting operations seems to drive fine-root distribution and create \n\nsoil favorable zones for C input and cycling."}]}}}
