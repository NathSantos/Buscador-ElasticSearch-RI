O objetivo de todo pa\u00eds em desenvolvimento \u00e9 o crescimento de sua \n\neconomia atrav\u00e9s do uso de suas receitas internas e a minimiza\u00e7\u00e3o do uso de empr\u00e9stimos e \n\nsubven\u00e7\u00f5es que trazem dificuldades para o pa\u00eds. A maneira mais importante de tornar isso \n\nposs\u00edvel \u00e9 atrav\u00e9s do uso da receita fiscal, ferramenta fundamental para a constru\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\nsustenta\u00e7\u00e3o das economias nacionais. Uma das \u00e1reas que exigem aten\u00e7\u00e3o nesse sentido \u00e9 o setor \n\ninformal. De uma popula\u00e7\u00e3o estimada de 1.5 milh\u00e3o de ganenses que pagam impostos diretos, o \n\nsetor informal representa menos de 5% desse n\u00famero.  \n\nO ponto central dessa tese \u00e9 o potencial de contribui\u00e7\u00e3o do setor informal para os cofres p\u00fablicos, \n\numa vez que esse apresenta grande potencial de crescimento e gera\u00e7\u00e3o de receita, especialmente \n\nse for levada em considera\u00e7\u00e3o a parcela de popula\u00e7\u00e3o que obt\u00e9m altos rendimentos e tem \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es de pagar impostos, mais ainda n\u00e3o o faz. Para que o governo possa aumentar sua \n\nreceita fiscal sem recorrer ao aumento das taxas \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio ampliar a rede fiscal para nela \n\nincluir todos aqueles que deveriam pagar impostos. Gana utiliza o sistema progressivo de \n\nimpostos, o que assegura que os impostos sejam proporcionais \u00e0 renda. Isso significa, portanto, \n\nque a carga tribut\u00e1ria \u00e9 uma responsabilidade compartilhada por todos os cidad\u00e3os, e o setor \n\ninformal n\u00e3o \u00e9 exce\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\n \n\nPalavras chave: Gana \u2013 setor informal \u2013 tributa\u00e7\u00e3o \u2013 formaliza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\nxiii \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\nThe informal Sector in Ghana by its size is very hug and employs the largest number of the \n\ncountry\u2019s labour force in both Agriculture and Non-agriculture activities yet, contribute very little \n\nin terms of tax revenue. It is the aim of every developing country to grow its economy by using \n\nmore of its own internally generated revenues and to minimize or do away with securing loans \n\nand grants from donors which brings a lot of hardship on the country. The most important way of \n\ncarrying out this is through the use of \u201cTaxation Revenue\u201d which is the fundamental tool for \n\nbuilding and sustaining national economies. One area that needs concentration in this regard is \n\nthe informal sector. Out of an estimated 1.5million Ghanaian tax population paying direct taxes, \n\nthe informal sector consists less than 5 percent of the number. This thesis focuses on the informal \n\nsectors potential to contribute substantially into the tax revenue coffers, since the sector is highly \n\npotential in the growth and revenue generation, especially those in the high income spectrum of \n\nthe sector who has the condition to pay taxes, yet are not paying. In order for the government to \n\nincrease its tax revenue potential without increasing the tax rate is to widen the tax net to capture \n\nall those who are to pay tax. Ghana is using the progressive tax system in its direct tax \n\nadministration, which ensures that the more your income the more tax you pay and the lower \n\nyour income the lower tax you pay. It\u2019s therefore means that the tax burden is a shared \n\nresponsibility of all citizens of the country for which the informal sector is not an exception. \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords: Ghana \u2013 informal sector \u2013 taxation \u2013 formalization\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\nxv \n\n \n\nLIST OF TABLES \n\nTable 1: Occupation of Employed Persons 15years and Above, 2010 .................................. 9 \n\nTable 2: Economic Activity Status of Persons 15years and Above by Sex, 2010 ............... 10 \n\nTable 3: Minimum Wage and Exchange Rate in Ghana (2000-2013) ................................. 13 \n\nTable 4: Employment Data of Informal Sector, Rural and Urban ....................................... 18 \n\nTable 5: Percentage Distribution of Employed Persons Aged 15 years and Older by Employment \n\nSector, 200 and 2010. ........................................................................................................... 19 \n\nTable 6: Percentage Distribution of Employed Persons Aged 15 years and Older by Employment \n\nStatus, 2000 and 2010 ........................................................................................................... 20 \n\nTable 7: Employment Distribution of MSMEs in Ghana, 2003. .......................................... 32 \n\nTable 8: Personal Income Tax Reliefs, 2002 and 2013 ........................................................ 41 \n\nTable 9: Annual Tax Rate for Self-Employed Persons, 2013. ............................................. 55 \n\nTable 10: Monthly Income Tax Rate for Employees, 2013 ................................................. 55 \n\nTable 11: Taxpayer Segmentation- GRA ............................................................................. 60 \n\nTable 12: Business Size and their Tax Contribution in Ghana............................................. 61 \n\nTable 13: Ghana Vehicle Income Tax Rate, 2013................................................................ 65 \n\nTable 14: Taxes Paid by Informal Sector (Self-Employed Persons) .................................... 68 \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\nxvii \n\n \n\nLIST OF FIGURES        \n\nFig. 1 Percentage Contribution by Tax Types\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.......\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.62 \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\nxix \n\n \n\nLIST OF BOXES   \n\nBox 1: Formalization of the Informal Economy: A Comprehensive Approach\u2026\u2026\u202637 \n\nBox 2: Important Issues of LI. 1727\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..65 \n\nBox 3: Important Issues of LI. 1803\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..68 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\nxxi \n\n \n\nAcronyms and Abbreviations \n\nNBSSI- National Board for Small Scale Industries \n\nGDP -

It is the \n\naim of every developing country to be able to grow its economy by using more of its own \n\ngenerated revenues in order to become self-sufficient, for which Ghana is not an exception. \n\nIn 2011, Ghana was declared a Lower Middle Income country, which then imposes \n\nmore challenge of self-reliance on internally generated funds than the over reliance on \n\ndonor funding of its major developmental programmes. \n\n For some decades, Ghana\u2019s budgeted revenues always fall short of its budgeted \n\nexpenditures, thereby resulting in huge deficits. For instance, Ghana\u2019s budget deficit was \n\nestimated at 3.2 percent of GDP in 2007, currently (2012) Ghana registered a budget deficit \n\nof 12 percent of GDP, which gives an increase of about 8.8 percent in five years.  Budget \n\ndeficits impose a barrier to achieve the projected goal of becoming a Middle Income \n\neconomy by the end of year 2015 (Budget statements 2007 &amp; 2013). One of the reasons \n\nwhy deficits arise as obstacles for growth is public debt \u2013 both domestic and external - as \n\nits payment divert resources from governmental productive investments in education, \n\nhealth care and infrastructure building among other needed investments. \n\nOne and most important way of achieving this goal is through the use of Taxation \n\nrevenue\n1\n. Taxation is a fundamental tool, which is used to provide the essential revenue to \n\nbuild a state that is accountable and responsive to its citizens. Thus it becomes an important \n\ninstrument for building and sustaining national economies. At the same time, accountability \n\nand transparency make easier for governments to tax its constituency, and to get support for \n\na wider tax base (Prichard, 2009).   \n\nGhana has a tax system that includes taxes on income and property,  taxes  on  \n\ndomestic  goods  and  services,  international  trade  taxes  and value-added tax (Osei and \n\nQuartey, 2005). Up to 1999, when VAT became operational, the largest component of \n\nGhana\u00b4s revenue was taxes on international trade. Nowadays, the most important category \n\nis the income and property taxes. The Pay As You Earn (PAYE) component of these taxes, \n\nrepresent almost a third of this category. The second most important source of revenue is \n\nthe value-added tax (VAT) was introduced initially in 1995, withdrawn and re-introduced \n\n                                                           \n1\n The author acknowledges this is not the only measure that can be used to address the huge budget deficit. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n2 \n\n \n\nin 1998. The conflicts surrounding VAT\u00b4s implementation show the need to be extremely \n\ncareful when trying to implement new taxes. \n\nIn order for the government to increase its tax revenue potential without increasing \n\nthe tax base/tax rate is to widen the tax net to include all those who must pay taxes. There \n\nare two types of problems included here, one is pure tax evasion, and another is simple \n\nunder reporting of income. In a very small set of cases taxes are not paid for simple \n\nignorance of this duty.   \n\nDue to their organization, mid-sized and large firms honor their tax duties, but small \n\nunits and self-employed workers barely contribute to the total tax revenue of the country.  \n\nThere is a major conceptual issue involved here: On the one hand, there is the \n\nproblem of the economic\u2013legal- activities that are not registered by the Government \n\nStatistical Offices, and thus go unaccounted in the GDP statistics. On the other hand, there \n\nis a certain proportion of the working population that is not under the protection of the labor \n\nlaws or the social protection net: self-employed people and workers in very small economic \n\nunits (micro units). The first group is included under the label of \u201cunderground economy\u201d, \n\n\u201cunregistered activities\u201d or \u201cinformal economic activities\u201d. The workers who are part of the \n\nsecond group are usually labeled as members of \u201cinformal sector\u201d. \n\nThere is a non-void intersection between those categories, clearly, as members of \n\nthe underground economy don\u00b4t pay taxes, but a certain proportion of the so called \n\n\u201cinformal sector\u201d certainly do. VAT and income and property taxes are collected from both \n\nthe formal and the informal sectors of the economy, while international trade taxes are only \n\ncollected from units in the formal economy as they are generally of medium to large size, \n\nand thus registered. While the formal sector is well structured in honoring its tax \n\nobligations, the same cannot be said of the informal sector. \n\nThe informal sector of Ghana employs more than 80percent of the total labour \n\nforce, which is largely self- employed, yet it contributes very little to the total tax revenue \n\ncollection of the country. It is estimated that out of about 1.5million Ghanaian tax \n\npopulation paying direct taxes, the informal sector contribution consists only 5 percent of \n\nthe number (Terpker, 2013).  \n\nSeth Terpker, the Minister of Finance, in his address to the Top managements of the \n\nGhana Revenue Authority (GRA) the body in charge of tax administration in the country, \n\n\n\n \n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nhas said among other things that the informal sector continue to be the worst offenders \n\nwhen it comes to tax evasion.  \n\nGhana is using the progressive tax system in its direct tax administration, which \n\nensures that the more your income the more tax you pay and the lower your income the \n\nlower tax you pay. It\u2019s therefore clear that the tax burden is a shared responsibility of all \n\ncitizens of the country for which the informal sector is not an exception. The informal \n\nsector\u2019s contribution to GDP in 2009 is estimated to be 38.4percent. Thus, one can expect \n\nthat the sector with such a size could contribute substantially to the tax revenue of Ghana. \n\nMany changes can be done in terms of taxing, not only the richest part of the Ghanaian \n\npopulation, but also foreign capital, big firms and financial capital. Those changes could \n\nbring forth higher tax revenue and greater levels of tax justice, In spite of those \n\npossibilities, the main focus of this work is to identify ways in which the informal sector \n\noperatives can increase its tax revenue contribution to the state.  \n\nA persistent feature of the Ghanaian economy is the large share of self-employment, \n\nas well as very small scale economic units, that conform to the so called \u201cinformal sector\u201d. \n\nSome members of the sector have the capacity to pay taxes, so they can be transformed into \n\na source of revenue that could add resources for economic development. It can be noted \n\nthat how to tax the sector remains a very difficult task (Anuradha&amp;Ayee, 2001), because it \n\nmeans also that there is a need to discuss policies aimed to formalize economic activities \n\nand labor relations, to support micro and small scale activities and at the same time to \n\nstrengthen the government\u00b4s punitive and fiscalization capacities, viz a vis tax evaders with \n\na real capacity to pay. \n\nAs governments of developing countries are finding ways of increasing internally \n\ngenerated funds to meet the growing pressure on them to improve infrastructure and other \n\nsocio-economic developmental issues facing their countries, a big informal sector is an \n\nimportant target for tax revenue, this is particularly important since the bigger share of that \n\nsector is in the total economy, economic viability, market share and relatively large \n\nincomes accrue to informal sector participants (Santos, 2013). Public policies to improve \n\nincome, productivity, revenue and economic performance of micro and small units can help \n\nthe formalization of informal enterprises and its labour relations, and to reduce tax evasion \n\nin the formal sector.  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n4 \n\n \n\nThus, proposals to formalize and tax at least the more successful groups of the \n\ninformal sector enterprises and workers, especially the urban informal sector, that can lead \n\nto increase in tax revenue come to fore as an important problem to be confronted. \n\nThe objectives of this study are to describe the main characteristics of urban \n\ninformal sector in Ghana and to define which sector, activities or people should effectively \n\npay tax, separating them from the poor people working in the informal sector; analyze ways \n\nof formalizing the informal sector in order to increase their tax contribution, considering \n\nsome important international experiences, mainly the public policies focusing on Brazil; \n\nanalyze the inhibiting factors that make it difficult for the informal sector to contribute \n\nsubstantially to the tax revenue of Ghana; to offer some suggestions that when addressed \n\ncan help the Ghana Revenue Authority to effectively tax the sector. \n\nThe importance of this study stems from the fact that the informal sector has \n\nbecome a focus of developing countries in their quest to maximize revenue from within and \n\nnot to always depend on foreign donors as well as borrowing to carry out economic \n\ndevelopments. This study can be justified also on the grounds of the need to think about a \n\nmore fair tax revenue structure that also contributes to reducing inequality. \n\nThe study will also add to the numerous research and existing body and knowledge \n\non international experiences on how to formalize the informal sector for the expansion of \n\nthe economy, improve the labour conditions and remuneration and also to increase tax \n\nrevenue. In these sense, the study will further help policy makers, especially, GRA-DTRD \n\nin fashioning out ways to address the critical issue of taxing the informal sector. \n\nThis work adopts the use of secondary information such as journals, academic \n\nstudies and official information from ILO, Ghanaian Government and other countries and \n\ninternational institutions which are of relevance to the study. The study seeks to analyze the \n\npotential contribution of the informal sector (urban-informal sector) to the tax revenue in \n\nGhana taking into consideration it huge size in the labour market. The study will also \n\nconsider the issues of formalization and how it can lead to increase in tax contribution from \n\nthe sector. \n\nUnfortunately, the researcher is constrained with obtaining adequate information on \n\nthe urban-informal sector in Ghana. It seems much attention has not been put on the \n\nimportance of the sector under consideration. The government needs to resource the Ghana \n\n\n\n \n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nStatistical Service adequately for them to conduct in depth research to cover all aspect of \n\nthe informal sector and its contribution to the country. \n\nThe broad outline of the study are that, chapter one will analyze the Ghana economy \n\nin area of Labour market and the general features of the informal sector. The second \n\nchapter will also look at the SMEs in Ghana and government support to them, the chapter \n\nwill also consider the discussion on formalization with some international experiences. The \n\nthird and the last chapter will consider the tax structure of Ghana and the contribution of \n\nincome tax from the various sectors of the economy. The final part of the chapter will \n\nassess the main aspect of the informal sector taxation and offer recommendations on how \n\nthe sector can be formalized in order to increase the tax revenue.  \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 1: ECONOMY, LABOUR MARKET AND GENERAL FEATURES OF \n\nINFORMAL SECTOR IN GHANA \n\n \n\n \n\nThe informal sector\u00b4s contribution to GDP in the Ghanaian economy is very \n\ndifficult to estimate in this work because there is lack of information on it by the Ghana \n\nStatistical Service, the institution in charge of providing economic data in the country. A \n\nfigure of 22% was recorded by (ILO/JASPA, 1989) and 38.4% is estimated as the sector\u2019s \n\ncontribution to GDP in 2009 (ISODEC, 2009). This contribution tells how the informal \n\nsector is of great importance to the state and would wish to see its reflection in their tax \n\nrevenue contribution.\n2\n  \n\nThe persistence of a large agricultural sector, with low levels of productivity and a \n\nlarge share of small farms, is a telltale signal of economic underdevelopment. This is so \n\nbecause average income generated in those activities is extremely low. Thus the country \n\nmight lack enough capacity for sustained growth, as investment and savings rates certainly \n\nwill be very small. This is particularly true in former colonies, as the colonial powers were \n\nonly interested in extracting agricultural or mining surplus and guaranteeing a stable market \n\nfor the imported goods they produced at the Metropolis. \n\nAs another consequence, the power of the State after independence was relatively \n\nweak, with lack of revenue that limits the capacity of the country in the area of industrial \n\ninvestments. The lack of an industrial sector and the resources needed to build up one sets \n\ndeveloping economies like Ghana into a vicious circle of low investment, low income and \n\npoverty. As the vast majority of the population needs some sort of labour income, the \n\npossibilities of self-employment stand up as a survival strategy for many workers. In the \n\ncase of Ghana, the resource based economy meant that industrialization is not a current \n\nnational priority. Revenue derived from raw materials or food products cannot use for \n\ncapital accumulation. \n\n                                                           \n2\n Informal sector operatives in Ghana, lack technology in their activities, most of them uses labour intensive \n\ncapital in their work, unlike the formal sector that operate with a lot of technological equipment.  Operatives \n\nin the sector work from simple tools to power operator equipment. These equipment\u2019s are rarely imported, \n\nthey are either self-constructed or second-hand that need some improvement. Raw materials used by the \n\ninformal sector for their work are largely from local resources or obtain from the formal sector.  Some \n\nmaterials are also locally produced, discarded materials (Scraps) and very low imported goods that cannot be \n\nlocally obtained.   \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n8 \n\n \n\nUnder these conditions, the lack of stimulus for generalized economic growth \n\nresults in a stable (if not growing) small economic units expansion.   \n\nGhana had its fair share of liberal policies in the mid-80s which adversely affected \n\nits labour market showing a constant decline in formal sector jobs, falling standards of jobs, \n\nlow economic activities and poor living standards of Ghanaians. During the 2000s, high \n\nrates of GDP growth were accompanied by a very low level of employment creation and a \n\ngrowing informal sector. This shows that, from a structural point of view, because of the \n\nneoliberal policies implanted during this period, the positive impacts derived from GDP \n\ngrowth were minimized.  \n\nIn a relatively poor country, whose modern productive sectors and manufacturing \n\nactivities are underdeveloped, poverty and the harshness of daily life in rural areas; force a \n\nrural urban migration process, with people seeking better jobs, access to social services and \n\nbetter living conditions. This urban expansion process promotes informal sector growth, \n\ngrowth that was intensified by decades of liberal policies. Therefore, in the last decades, \n\nGhana\u2019s labour market has seen a dominance of informal employment, self-subsistence \n\nactivities, low productivity and small income agricultural activities. \n\n \n\n1.1  Labour Market and Informality in Ghana \n\nIn terms of occupation in the country, a significant number of 3,875,957 \n\nrepresenting 40.1% of the population are in agricultural employment. Another category of \n\nemployees who deserves much of attention is \u2018Service and Sales Workers\u2019 due to their \n\nrecent contributions to Ghana\u2019s economy. 21.5% of the population representing 2,076,970 \n\nof the labour force is service and sales workers (see table below). However, despite the \n\nfairly recent rates, the growth performance of the economy has not been sufficient to meet \n\nthe employment needs of the rapidly expanding labour force. A high number of employees \n\nin this sector are not in permanent employment despite the various professions they find \n\nthemselves in. Regardless of the fact that temporary employees can be found in professions \n\nsuch as banking, sales and marketing, teaching, information technology etc., contract or \n\ntemporary employees are generally employed in hazardous jobs or jobs of low complexities \n\nwith earnings below that of their permanent counterparts and in most cases they are less \n\nlikely to have health and pension benefits. 15.6% of the population engages in craft and \n\nrelated trade works. Professionals and Managers also account for 5.5% and 2.5% \n\n\n\n \n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nrespectively. Of the active population, only 1.5% are clerical support workers and 1.9% are \n\ntechnicians and associate professionals. \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1: Occupation of Employed Persons 15years and Above, 2010 \n\nOccupation Employed Figures % \n\nTotal 9,657,179 100.0 \n\nManagers 239,343 2.5 \n\nProfessionals 533,793 5.5 \n\nTechnicians and associate professionals 181,219 1.9 \n\nClerical support workers 143,225 1.5 \n\nService and sales workers 2,076,970 21.5 \n\nSkilled agricultural forestry and fishery workers 3,875,957 40.1 \n\nCraft and related trades workers 1,506,206 15.6 \n\nPlant and machine operators and assemblers 494,335 5.1 \n\nElementary occupations 588,377 6.1 \n\nOther occupation 17,754 0.2 \n\nSource: GSS 2010 Population and Housing Census \n\n  \n\nThe 2010 Population and Housing Census conducted by the Ghana Statistical \n\nService on 170 Metropolitan, Municipal and Districts Assemblies revealed that, out of \n\n14,040,893 of the population who are potentially to be in some economic activity, 73.1% \n\n(10,268,699) are involved in some kind of economic activity\n3\n. The labour market currently \n\nhas a total of 9,657,179 employed with 4,713,480 males and 4,943,699 females. There is \n\nmore percentage of females than males currently in some economic activity. The total \n\nparticipation rate is 73.1% and an occupation rate 68.8%. The unemployment rate was \n\naround 6%; in absolute terms, the unemployment figure shows a total of 611,520 persons \n\ncurrently without any employment and again with a female dominance as they number \n\n337,187, compared with 274,333 unemployed males.\n4\n This shows that occupation and \n\nparticipation rates are high, and at the same time unemployment levels are not high, in a \n\n                                                           \n3\n A total of 3,772,199 people are not economically active which may be as a result of being at school, \n\nincapacitation, ill health or women playing housewife roles.  \n4\n The survey considered economically active population to be \u00b4all persons who did some economic activity \n\nfor pay, profit or family gain seven days prior to the enumeration\u00b4. Leave applicants, temporary ill and \n\ntemporarily laid off persons who also did some work before the survey were considered employed.

Data from the GSS quarterly digest (1960-1991), \n\nshowed that major expansion of public sector employment in Ghana took place before 1965 \n\nrecording 10.2 percentage points\u2019 increment over the 1960 public sector employment when \n\nthere exist numerous of government establishments in Ghana.\n6\n The sector saw a drastic \n\ndecline in it employment generation between 1975 and 1989, due to the crisis times of coup \n\nd\u2019\u00e9tats in the seventies and the Structural Adjustment Programmes in the early eighties. \n\nAccording to the 2010 Population and Housing Census report, the public sector of Ghana\u00b4s \n\neconomy employed 475,416 (6.4%) of the total labour force in the year 2000. Although the \n\nnumber of employees increased in the 2010 census, the percentage share in the labour force \n\n                                                           \n5\n Ghana\u00b4s unemployment figure currently stands at 6% for both sexes and high among females (6.4%) than \n\nmales (5.5%). This figures don\u00b4t include long term unemployment  as people who are not working but stop \n\nlooking for job 7 days prior to the enumeration will not be considered unemployed The criterion used by the \n\nGSS which is a benchmark of IMF in the survey does not give a true reflection of the unemployment situation \n\nin the country. \n6\n The public sector increased its work force by 40 percent. Public sector employees are the number of people \n\non government payroll as are referred to as workers in the Civil Service, Ghana Education Service, Judiciary, \n\nthe law enforcement agencies, the Article 71 employees, the Foreign Missions, and Subverted Agencies. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n11 \n\n \n\ndeclined to 6.2% as captured in table 5 below (GSS, 2012). The private sector (both formal \n\nand informal) has become the sole provider of all essential services and also the main \n\nsource of employment. This reduction in the state\u00b4s role of employment creation in recent \n\nyears can be attributed to the introduction of the economic reforms by the government in \n\n2008, as a way of reducing the public wage bill. Thus, the private sector has become the \n\nsector of attraction for the teeming jobseekers, but the supply of formal Jobs in this segment \n\nwas not enough to counter the expansion of informal activities. The formal sector \n\nemployment in Ghana is referred to as those having a legally enforceable employment \n\ncontract with employee and contributing to the Social Security and National Insurance \n\nTrust (SSNIT) or both in the private sector. The private sector encompasses a wide range of \n\neconomic activities. Among these activities are; banking &amp; non-banking financial services, \n\nmining, construction, agriculture, forestry &amp; logging, manufacturing, transport, trade, social \n\n&amp; personal services. Because of the negative impacts of neoliberal reforms on formal \n\nemployment, in recent years, the sector has received considerable attention from both \n\ngovernment and development partners, aiming at developing and positioning the sector to \n\nsupport the public sector as a major source of formal employment.  \n\nThe Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT), in its 2011 annual report \n\nshows that the formal sector establishments covered by the scheme increased from 27,980 \n\nestablishments in 2007 to 36,534 in 2011. Of this figures the private sector has the highest \n\nshare of 27,857 as against the public sector\u2019s share of 123 in 2007. In 2011, out of the total, \n\nthe private sector still has the highest 36,534 establishments with the public sector \n\nmanaging a share of only 101 establishments.  \n\n Again the SSNIT report indicates that in 2011 out of an estimated 963,619 \n\nemployees contributing to the scheme in Ghana. More than half of this number (560,955) \n\nrepresenting about 58.21% are private sector employees, all public institution contribute the \n\nremaining of 402,664 (SSNIT, 2012 p.15). However, despite the above impressive figures, \n\nemployment from the private formal sector in total employment fell from 8.5 to 6.8%, and \n\nremains relatively small, according to the 2010 census results (see table 5 below).  \n\nIn addressing the labour market issues in Ghana, one cannot skip the issue of \n\nminimum wage which is at the heart of a successful income policy. At the beginning of \n\nevery year Government, Employers and the Organized Labour (Tripartite) meet to fix the \n\nminimum wage for workers. This wage is the amount below which no employer must pay a \n\n\n\n \n \n\n12 \n\n \n\nworker. As part of the communiqu\u00e9 which is issued at the end of the meeting, the minimum \n\nwage does not attract tax. This is done by considering the economic indicators at the time. \n\nThis has over the period increased steadily, especially in the last decade. The minimum \n\nwage for 2013 is GH\u00a25.24 (US$ 2.6) daily. Earnings or incomes from the sector are \n\ngenerally low. Many of the informal sector employees earn less than the monthly minimum \n\nwage as compared to their counterparts in the formal sector, about 58% earn below the \n\nminimum wage in the country (Baah, 2006). The statistical data from the GLSS5 indicate \n\nthat 46% of food crop farmers earn less than the national minimum wage. The report \n\nfurther shows that 10% of private formal and 8% of public sector workers also earn less \n\nthan the monthly minimum wage (GLSS 5). Unfortunately, there is no study on the average \n\nincome of informal sector workers in the country. The table below shows the national \n\nminimum wage from 2000 to 2013 as contained in the above report and also by the Ghana \n\nTrades Union Congress\n7\n. From the table below, one can see how low wage levels in Ghana \n\nare which force even people with formal jobs to still have enterprises in the informal sector \n\nto support their monthly incomes, which has contributed to the high informal sector \n\noperations in the country. \n\nAgain, profit also varies between different activities. Records on the profit and \n\nearnings of the sector is not available, however, Sowa et al., 1992 and Barwa, 1995, \n\nprovides that about 21% of the enterprises at the large end of the small-scale spectrum \n\nexperience over 50% growth in output as compared to only 9% of the micro enterprises, \n\nwhich means when incomes or profit are relatively low, it impedes growth. In as much as \n\nwe recognize incomes or profit of the informal sector entrepreneurs as low, some segment \n\nof them also earn relatively high returns yet, they still find themselves in the sector. \n\nThus, income levels for informal sector activities and for self-employed workers is \n\nlow, but employers of the more organized small scale activities have higher income levels, \n\npotentially compatible with paying taxes    \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                           \n7\nThe Exchange rates are from the BoG and the Minimum wage data from the GTUC. Ghana redenominated \n\nits currency in July 2007, the new Ghana Cedis exchanged for the old cedi at \u00a2 10,000.00 toGH\u00a21.00, Data \nfrom 2000 to 2007 are in the old Cedis and that of 2008 to 2013 in the new Ghana Cedis.

This group is constituted by self-employed or own-account \n\nworkers, owner of small businesses, employee of small, medium or big businesses without \n\nregister or access to labor rights who deal in production, sales and distribution of goods and \n\nservice in the urban areas of the country. \n\nMore than half of the employed population in Ghana are self-employed or own-\n\naccount workers and a significant proportion of the labour force that are in wage \n\nemployment also does not have formal employer-employee relationship making it \n\nextremely difficult to provide them with any form of protection, leaving them in the contest \n\nof job insecurity and low income. Public policy relating to the labour market has undergone \n\nsignificant changes over recent years, these changes respond to demands for greater \n\nflexibility in the labour market but they also respond to the pressures of growing levels of \n\nunemployment and its consequences for worsening conditions in the labour market. The \n\n\n\n \n \n\n14 \n\n \n\nnegative impact of the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) which was implemented in \n\nmost developing countries including Ghana in the 1980s and the early 1990s had long term \n\nconsequences (Barwa, 1995). \n\nThe above mentioned groups of workers are usually included under a single name: \n\ninformal urban sector. There is a long standing discussion regarding how to define the \n\ninformal sector, which activities constitute the sector and what name to give to it. The first \n\norganization to officially adopt the term Informal Sector was the ILO, in a report on \n\nemployment in Kenya and continued to act as a driving force behind the study and the \n\ndebate of the concept. Keith Hart, an anthropologist whom the origin of informal sector is \n\nattributed to, in his paper, Informal income opportunities and urban employment in Ghana \n\n(Hart, 1973), presented at an Institute of Development Studies (IDS) conference on Urban \n\nUnemployment in Africa in 1971, described the \u201ceconomic activities of the low-income \n\nsection of the labour force in Accra, the urban sub-proletariat into which the unskilled and \n\nilliterate majority are drawn\u201d (Hart, 1973 p.61). Hart further focused on individual income \n\nopportunities and placed wage-earners in the formal sector and self-employed in the \n\ninformal, which include both legitimate and illegitimate income sources (ibid, p.68-69). \n\nThe use of the term informal sector became widely accepted among academia and the \n\ninternational development community in the 1980s. Thomas (1992), acknowledged the fact \n\nthat there was some understanding of what kind of activities or groups of workers that \n\ncould be associated with the sector, but focus and definition still remain.  \n\nThe ILO adopted the term informal sector because what it used to be the traditional \n\nsector had become \u201cprofitable and efficient enterprises as well as marginal activities\u201d. \n\nThus, the change in the activities of the sector had a total change in the idea that this sector \n\nwould eventually be absorbed into the modern capitalist or the formal economy and \n\ndisappears (Chen, 2005, p.2&amp;3).  \n\nResearchers have defined the informal sector in many ways. Many of these \n\ndefinitions are descriptive because of the difficulties involved in capturing all the \n\ndimensions of the informal sector in one definition. The most common features of the \n\nsectors activities are that the sector is unregistered, unregulated or the institutions escape \n\nregulations. Peattie 1987, p.851, describes the informal sector concept as \u201cexceedingly \n\nfuzzy\u201d. Thus, bringing a lot of confusion in coming out with a single definition of the \n\nsector. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n15 \n\n \n\nThe following are some of the definitions that have been used in the literature and \n\nare of relevance to this study. We should keep in mind that the first two definitions used the \n\nterm \u201cinformal sector\u201d as synonymous with undeclared or underground economy.  \n\na) Feige (1989) defined the informal sector as \u201call currently unregistered economic \n\nactivities that contribute to the officially calculated Gross National Product\u201d. His \n\ndefinition point to the fact that the sector is recognized but yet not registered, either \n\nfor regulation or tax purposes. \n\nb) Schneider (2005) re-echoes the fact that the sector\u2019s economic activities and the \n\nincome derived from that circumvent or otherwise escape government regulation, \n\ntaxation or observation. In other words, the informal sector here does not include \n\nillegitimate activities such as smuggling, armed robbery, just to mention a few. \n\nThese illegal activities even though may provide income to the individuals \n\ninvolved, but add very little value to the society and the national economy (Fambon, \n\n2006). \n\nc) Farrell et al (2000) and Thomas (1992) have defined the sector in two approaches: \n\n\u201cthe definitional and behavioral\u201d.  \n\n \n\nAccording to Farrell, the definitional approach, \u201cis an economic activity unrecorded \n\nin the official statistics such as the gross domestic product and/or the national income \n\naccount\u201d whiles the behavioral approach, sees the informal sector on the basis of \u201cwhether \n\nor not activity complies with the established judicial, regulatory and institutional \n\nframework\u201d.  For Thomas, the definitional approach is used to estimate the size and the \n\neconomic value of the informal sector, and the behavioral approach is used to explain the \n\ncauses of the informal sector. In broad terms, he refers to the sector as all productive \n\nactivities, which are not included in the national income accounts of the country (Thomas, \n\n1992).  \n\nAmin (2002, p.9), also stress that defining the sector depends largely on country by \n\ncountry and went ahead to come out with two approaches in which the informal sector can \n\nbe defined, his approaches are 1) the Enterprise or 2) the status of labour.   \n\nInformal activities in the urban and rural sectors are very different, so there is a \n\nclear need to examine them separately (Adu-Amankwah, 1999, FES, 2012).  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n16 \n\n \n\nThe rural informal sector is basically agriculture activities, ranging from small farm \n\nunits, peasant or subsistence in nature, fishing and fish processes to rural agro-based \n\nprocessing. Agriculture (Both rural and Urban) employs about 54% of the total labour force \n\nand 63% of all self-employment non-agriculture work in Ghana. The actors in the informal \n\nagriculture sector are mostly illiterates or semi-illiterate, thus, they have not gone through \n\nany formal education or training. They generally depend on apprenticeship for their skills \n\nas well as family labour (Baah, 2006). The rural informal sector have less income, less \n\norganized and low productivity, and the urban informal sector have more potential to \n\nformalization and to increase their tax revenue. \n\nOn the other hand, the urban informal sector, the main subject of our work, is \n\ncharacterized by its heterogeneity. The sector\u00b4s activities are grouped into small, medium \n\nand micro scale businesses in the areas of trading, transportation, construction, food \n\npreparation, dress making, footwear making, distilleries, Services, Manufacturing etc. \n\nAccording to Barwa (1995), male dominance in the areas of manufacturing, such as metal \n\nfabrication, footwear making is more than their female counterpart who dominates in the \n\nareas of Service sector such as food processing, trading and dress making.  \n\nAccording to the GSS, 2008, 80% of the informal sector work is dominated by three \n\nsectors, agriculture/fishery workers (55.1%), manufacturing/craft workers (13.4%) and the \n\nservice/sales workers (13%). As it has been established earlier, agriculture is predominantly \n\nrural occupation, however many urban informal activities are dominated by service/sales \n\nwork, such as, wholesale and retail, vehicle repairs.  \n\nIn this text, the focused is on the urban informality, we consider the urban informal \n\nsector to include enterprises that are not legally registered, regulated, protected and \n\nmajority of whom are self-employed without employees (own account businesses) and self-\n\nemployment with employees, they have ease of entry and exit as well as a very high \n\ncompetitive environment and they generally engage in transactions on cash bases which \n\nmakes it difficult for authorities to monitor their real income. Many of the operatives in the \n\nsector do not have permanent premises for their businesses; they operate in areas they can \n\nbe seen in the general public. Many of them also operate from their residences, with some \n\nunder sheds and structures. They are also puts under the threat of the local authorities to \n\neject them from the public spaces (Baah, 2006 and Osei-Boateng, 2011). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n17 \n\n \n\nIn 2010, out of the total informal labour force of 8,364,649 (86.2%), 51% were from \n\nthe urban area and 48.8% in the rural area. From the table 4 below, informal sector activity \n\nis high in the rural area (92.7% of the labour force) as compared to the urban area (66.2%). \n\nNon-agriculture employment is higher in the urban areas (47.4%) of the country than the \n\nrural areas (17.7%).  According to Baah (2006, p.12), Self-employment in the non-\n\nagricultural activities account for 28% of total labour force and 37% of all informal sector \n\nworkforce in the country, with women accounting for 57% of all informal sector activities. \n\nAccording to Amin (2002, p.11), estimating the size of the sector remains \n\nproblematic, thus most countries are not able to conduct comprehensive survey on the \n\nsector leaving out a lot of areas that are important to the sector. In Ghana, the size of the \n\ninformal sector is estimated to be 86.2% of the total labour force, according to the \n\nPopulation and Housing Census (PHC) conducted by the GSS in 2010 (GSS, 2013). The \n\nsector is made up of self-employed with employee, self-employed without employees, \n\ncontributing family workers, apprenticeships, as well as domestic workers (GSS, 2013, \n\np.266). Although there are no data to prove the size of the urban informal sector in the past, \n\nit has been in existence before the SAP, by considering the survey conducted by Keith Hart \n\nin 1973 on the urban informal entrepreneurs in Ghana however, the current data show that \n\nthe introduction of the SAP worsened the situation with it numerous changes in the labour \n\nmarket. The largest is the self-employed without employees, which are small/medium scale \n\nenterprises in nature.   \n\nThe informal sector of Ghana lack proper linkage with the formal sector. Most of \n\nthe products of the sector are sold directly to the final consumers. This does not encourage \n\ngrowth and formalization of the sector. There should be a mechanism that will require the \n\nformal sector to patronize the products of the informal sector. The public sector can design \n\nlaws that will ensure that the informal sector becomes the first point of call for any goods or \n\nservice required.  A proper linkage of the two sectors is very important, as this can be a \n\nvehicle for the transmission of skills, resources and market for the benefit of both sectors.  \n\nThe situation where, policies and regulation in the labour market are designed to the \n\nadvantage of the formally registered firms is not encouraging proper and coherent linkage \n\nof the two sectors. Most of the informal sector enterprises provide raw materials or supply \n\nfinished goods to the formal firms either directly or through other informal intermediate \n\nfirms. Like the structuralist school of thought that believe that the formal and the informal \n\n\n\n \n \n\n18 \n\n \n\nsector economies are intrinsically linked, and that to ensure increase competitiveness, \n\ncapitalist firms in the formal economy are seen to reduce their input costs, which include \n\nthe labour costs, by promoting informal production and employment relations with \n\nsubordinated economic units and workers. Chen, 2005, acknowledge that to understand the \n\nlinkage between the formal and the informal economies it is important to consider the \n\nnature of the production system through which they are linked. I believe there is also the \n\nneed for government to step in to invest in the economy in areas that will require the use of \n\nthe goods and services of the informal sector, because the reliance on the private formal has \n\nfailed to offer the needed linkage to promote the growth agenda of the informal sector.   \n\nThe average size of employment is four, however, the number vary on the type of \n\nactivities, for instance those in restaurants will require more hands than those in transport \n\nbusiness (Baah, 2006). The tendency of informal activities to grow is so great that even \n\nworkers with good educational levels get their jobs from this sector. Currently an estimated \n\nnumber of 250,000 fresh graduates enter the labour market annually; yet, the formal sector \n\nabsorbs only 2% of this number leaving the rest either in unemployment or in the informal \n\nsector (Ulandssekretariatet, 2013). \n\n \n\nTable 4: Employment Data of Informal Sector, Rural and Urban \n\nCATEGORY ABSOLUTE NUMBERS PERCENTAGE SHARE \n\nFormal Sector 1,413,596 13.8 \n\nInformal sector 8,829,851 86.2 \n\nTotal 10,243,447 100.0 \n\nUrban Labour Force 5,125,635 50.04 \n\nRural Labour Force 5,117,841 49.96 \n\nTotal 10,243,447 100.0 \n\n \n\nRural informal Workers \n\n \n\n4,744,239 \n\n \n\n92.7 \n\n\n\n \n \n\n19 \n\n \n\n \n\nUrban Informal Workers \n\n \n\n3,393,170 \n\n \n\n66.2 \n\nTotal 8,137,409  \n\nRural Non-Agriculture \n\nworkers (IS) \n\n \n\n870,483 \n\n \n\n17.7 \n\nUrban Non- Agriculture \n\nWorkers (IS) \n\n \n\n2,395,617 \n\n      \n\n 47.4    \n\nTOTAL 3,266,100 \n\n \n\n      \n\n                     \nSource: GLSS V and the National Analytical Report, 2013 by GSS.

Self-employed \n\nwith employees are mostly found in the restaurants, woodworking (furniture), metal \n\nfabrication, construction and commerce (wholesale and retail). The sector\u00b4s employment \n\nranges from retail and restaurants 50%, manufacturing 37%, services 10% to transport 3% \n\n(Yankson 1992, Barwa, 1995). This category account for 5.2% in 2000 and 4.9% in 2010 \n\n(See the table 6 below). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n20 \n\n \n\nThe table below shows that a high percentage of the active population is in \u2018Self \n\nEmployment without Employees\u2019. Self-Employed with employees account for only about \n\n5%, meanwhile, they are mostly private informal jobs with challenges of job insecurity and \n\nlow incomes influenced by local customs and traditions of employment devoid of \n\nemployment and employment relationships as in the case of formal employment where \n\nemployment contracts tend to be subjected to some measure of legislative control making it \n\nextremely difficult to provide them with any form of social and legal protection. High \n\nnumbers of the self-employed category are subsistence farmers in husbandry, forestry and \n\nfishing. Majority of them can also be seen at the major cities in Ghana mainly Accra (the \n\ncapital) engaging in one economic activity or the other just for survival. It can be concluded \n\nthat employees in this category are just occupied by this form of employment in spite of the \n\nfact that most of them earn below the national minimum wage. Ayee, 2007 in his paper \n\n\u201cBuilding Tax Compliance through Reciprocity with Government\u201d has provided a lot of \n\ninformal organizations and associations\n8\n, (Pages 3 &amp; 4). These groupings represent the \n\nmajority of the informal sector activities in Ghana.  \n\n \n\nTable 6: Percentage Distribution of Employed Persons Aged 15 years and Older \n\nby Employment Status, 2000 and 2010 \n\n \n\nEMPLOYMENT STATUS 2000   2010 \n\nEmployees 16.0   18.0 \n\nSelf-Employed without employees 68.2 \n\n \n\n60.1 \n\nSelf-Employed with employees 5.2 \n\n \n\n4.9 \n\nCasual workers 0.0 \n\n \n\n2.0 \n\nContributing family work 6.7 \n\n \n\n11.7 \n\nApprentice 2.8 \n\n \n\n2.7 \n\nDomestic Employees 0.7 \n\n \n\n0.6 \n\nOthers \n\n \n\n0.5 \n\n \n\n0.2 \n\nTotal \n\n \n100 \n\n \n\n100 \n\nTotal Number   7,428,374                10,243,476  \n\nSource: Ghana Statistical Service, 2013  \n   \n\n                                                           \n8\n Some of the informal groups are: Ghana Private Road Transport Union, Ghana Cooperative Transport \n\nSociety, Progressive Transport Owners Association, Ghana National Chemical Sellers Association, Ghana \n\nNational Tailors and Dressmakers Association, Musician Union of Ghana, Phonogram Producers Association, \n\nGhana Tape Recorders Association, National Drinking Bar Operators Association, National Garage Owners \n\nAssociation \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n21 \n\n \n\nAccording to a recent data, about 80% of all manufacturing employments and 90% \n\nof employment in trade and commerce is provided by the informal sector, with about 56% \n\nin the service activities (FES, Ghana, 2011). Majority of the men in the informal sector are \n\ninto the services and the manufacturing activities, whiles, the women are mostly into \n\ntrading and commerce activities (Ibid, 2011). The labour Act in Ghana has it that \n\nemployment relations are formalized by signing of a written contract between employers \n\nand employees. This provision is not complied by many private businesses both formal and \n\ninformal with the latter been the worst affected. Section 12 of the Labour Act states that \n\n\u00b4\u00b4the employment of a worker by employer for a period of six months or more or for a \n\nnumber of working days equivalent to six months or more within a year shall be secured by \n\na written contract of employment``.  \n\nThe compliance of this provision is not enforced by the authorities responsible. In \n\nGhana, enforcement of the labour law is generally weak and the fact that the informal \n\nsector is not regulated makes it very difficult for any action to be taken against those \n\nemployers (Osei-Boateng, 2011). The fear of a worker losing his/her job also prevents them \n\nfrom reporting to the authorities, making them more vulnerable to their employers. The \n\ninformal worker has but very little chance of demanding his/her rights in an employment \n\nrelation. The trade union has a greater responsibility to ensure that the informal sector \n\nworkers are organized in order for them to enjoy their rights as workers. The enforcement \n\nof the labour Act to cover all workers irrespective of the sector need to be taken seriously, \n\nif there can ever be an end to this numerous inhuman treatments informal workers go \n\nthrough as well as ensuring that the minimum wage policy is implemented to cover these \n\nvulnerable workers. These are aspects that also contribute to the expansion of informal \n\nemployment in Ghana. \n\nGhana\u00b4s informal sector as it has been identified earlier is made up of many \n\nactivities mostly concentrated in the urban cities in the country, mainly the domestic \n\nworkers and the street vendors sectors.\n9\n One domestic worker is said to be in every \n\nhousehold with larger households having more (LAWA-Ghana, 2003, Osei-Boateng, \n\n                                                           \n9\n The hidden nature of the domestic work in Ghana makes it difficult to obtain any statistical data on its \n\nactivities. They are generally carried out in private homes, with very few in offices. The labour Act (Act 651, \n\n2003) section 175, has defined domestic worker as \u201ca person who is not a member of the famil y of a person \n\nwho employs him/her as house-help\u201d.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n22 \n\n \n\n2011). In Ghana, the practice of using poor family relations as unpaid domestic workers is \n\nalso common which normally end up seeing the use of under-age as domestic workers \n\n(Tsikata, 2009). These workers are usually from poor or deprived background and have to \n\nsurvive no matter the circumstances they find themselves. Activities of domestic workers \n\nrange from house-helps, gardeners, private security workers, cleaners, laundry men/women, \n\ndrivers, cooks to nannies (Osei-Boateng, 2011).  \n\nWhen it comes to employment of domestic workers, they are normally done through \n\nfriends and relatives, so, there is no legal contract of employment between the employer \n\nand the worker, agreement is mostly verbal. Although in Ghana, formal contract are \n\nsupposed to be sign between employer and employee after six month of regular \n\nengagement in a year, same cannot be said for the informal sector in general and domestic \n\nworkers in particular. In some urban centers there are recruitment companies and agents \n\nwho recruit domestic workers as intermediaries, these companies usually sign the contract \n\nwith the employer on behalf of the worker. The companies then ensure that all disputes are \n\nresolved. The agents on the other hand, only ensures that the worker get the work, takes his \n\ncommission, any contract is between the worker and the employer, he does not perform any \n\nmediation function again (Osei-Boateng, 2011).The lack of written contracts in the \n\ninformal sector and especially the domestic workers is the result of \u201cunfair termination of \n\nemployment relations by employers in the sector and some domestic workers also leave \n\ntheir employment at will without notice\u201d (Ibid, p.9). \n\nIn terms of wages, the domestic workers like most informal sector workers, earn \n\nbelow the national monthly minimum wage in most households in Ghana, there is no \n\nseparate law that fight for the right of domestic workers as in the case of Brazil. According \n\nto Osei-Boateng, in 2010, domestic workers in the capital city of Ghana (ACCRA), \n\nreceived monthly wages between GH80 (US$57.00) and GH 100.00 (US$71.00). Although \n\nthese payments were above the minimum wage at the time, they were still low, especially \n\ndependent individuals.  \n\nIn Ghana, street vendors mostly are found in the urban cities especially the major \n\ncapital cities. Like the domestic workers, there is no statistical data or information from the \n\nGhana statistical service on the activities of the street vendors as well.  A study on the \n\nactivities of these street vendors conducted by Mittulah and cited by Osei-Boateng \n\nhowever, reveals that majority of these people are women, including widows, who have to \n\n\n\n \n \n\n23 \n\n \n\nput food on the table of her family. Their male counterpart also join street trading at a very \n\nyoung ages with the hope to leave when they get good jobs (Mittulah, 2003 and Osei-\n\nBoateng, 2011). \n\nEducation attainment is also very low among street vendors. 52% of street food \n\nvendors in Accra had basic education as the maximum education level and 36percent had \n\nno education (Obeng-Asiedu, 2000, Osei-Boateng, 2011). The major driven force of street \n\nvending like most informal activity is poverty. \u201cAs many as 92.5percent, of street vendors \n\nin the capital city (Accra) were found to be migrants from other regions in the country to \n\nseek better standard of living\u201d (Osei-Boateng, 2011, p.7). Most of these people come with \n\nthe hope of leaving with their relatives to better their lives, but they end up in the street to \n\nfend for themselves. \n\nUnlike domestic workers and other workers within the informal sector, street \n\nvendors are mostly self-employed, they control their own profit from the sales they make, \n\nalthough these incomes can be irregular, they are able to manage it. \n\n \n\n1.3 Life Condition of Workers in the Urban Informal Sector \n\nInformal sector employees in Ghana do not have any social protection, many of \n\nthem are not considered in the decision making process, not even the once that affect their \n\nwork, such as, their wages, health and safety at the work place. Access to benefits such as, \n\nsick leave with pay, annual leave with pay, pension scheme are not guaranteed at all as well \n\nas lack of income and job security (Osei-Boateng, 2011).  In Ghana, there is a pension \n\nscheme that mandates employers and employees to contribute into a fund that gives \n\nguarantee to workers on retirement. Many informal workers do not enjoy these facilities \n\nbecause of lack of written contract. However, the scheme allows individuals within the \n\ninformal sector to make their own contributions with a defined benefit at the end of their \n\nworking life (SSNIT, 2012). This arrangement is for both self-employed persons and \n\nworkers. The special scheme allows interested informal sector individuals to make \n\ncontribution at their own convenience, daily, weekly or seasonal basis. One can have some \n\nsort of relief in the fact that if employers are not contributing to their future; they have the \n\nopportunity to do so by themselves. The government has also established some social \n\nprotection programs for the citizens which operatives in the informal sector can also take \n\nadvantage of them to support their livelihood. Some of the schemes are: The National \n\n\n\n \n \n\n24 \n\n \n\nHealth Insurance Scheme, the Capitation Grant to basic school children which guarantees \n\nfree basic education for all school going age, free school feeding program, the free school \n\nuniforms and the supply of exercise books to basic schools as well as the cash transfers for \n\nthe very poor households known as the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) \n\n(FES, 2011, P.4-10).   \n\nMajority of the informal people are not highly educated, some researchers put it at \n\nabout 36.1% (Ayee, 1977) to 50% (Yankson, 1992), these are those whose education is \n\nbelow the secondary school level. Currently, in Ghana, education attainment in the \n\neconomic active population as reported by the GSS are that 33% have never been to school, \n\n47.8% have obtained basic education whiles, only 19.2% have secondary education and \n\nhigher.  Apprenticeship also is important in the informal sector - GSS put the numbers at \n\n2.8% and 2.7% for 2000 and 2010 respectively -, as skills and knowledge is transferred to \n\nothers. This was higher in the 1990s, about 54% (Yankson, 1992). The levels of literacy \n\nalso have direct relationship with the level of informality in a country. It is obvious that, \n\nwith a low formal labor supply and a great labor surplus population in the urban areas, \n\npeople with low education cannot be attracted by the formal sector. Employers are looking \n\nfor persons with high skills to work with, by this those with very low education finds \n\nthemselves in the informal sector to make a living or survive.  According to Baah, 2006, \n\n\u201ccountries where the share of formal economy is large, their literacy rates are also high\u201d, \n\nwhich then means that the reverse is also true. There is a positive correlation between \n\npoverty, underemployment, informal sector and lack of public policies.   \n\nBut it is important to emphasize that there is not necessarily a causal relationship \n\nbetween low education level and informal employment. A greater supply of jobs in medium \n\nand large companies and the public sector, due to possible higher levels of development \n\nand industrialization and higher rate of economic growth can increase the rate of \n\nformalization, by employing workers in the formal sector who currently are not hired \n\nbecause there is no demand and not because they have a low level of education and \n\nqualification. Even in more advanced and developed countries in this current pattern of \n\ncapitalist development, sectors are compatible with workforce of low-skilled occupations \n\nbecause they are repetitive jobs such as assembly lines, construction, cleaning etc. On the \n\nother hand, the increase in development and the pace of industrialization and economic \n\ngrowth are aspects that contribute to the rise in per capita income and tax revenues, \n\n\n\n \n \n\n25 \n\n \n\nallowing greater investment in education, training and professional qualification. Thus, the \n\ncorrelation reported by Baah (2006) expressed over the relationship between low level of \n\ndevelopment, low per capita income, low investment in education at the same time hinder \n\nhigher education spending and limit the expansion of formal employment, since capitalist \n\nsectors that are typically more organized, with highest levels of productivity and able to \n\noffer formal jobs have low share of the total employed population.  \n\nOn the other hand, workers in the informal sector face appalling living conditions \n\nrelated to the lack of urban and social infrastructure. Ghana is generally fighting to cube its \n\nsanitation problem, especially in the urban areas. Health of Ghanaians in general and the \n\noperatives in the informal sector in particular poses great danger. Poor public and \n\nenvironmental health, in both the residential and market areas where informal sector \n\nworkers operate is a major urban problem in Ghana and are risk to the health of many \n\ninformal workers (Apt and Amankrah, 2004; King and Oppong, 2003; Kwankye et al, \n\n2007, Osei-Boateng). Heaps of garbage remains the common sight on the streets of the \n\nmajor cities even as vendors do brisk business. Many workers in the informal sector are \n\neither ignorant about hazardous practices or substances or simply cannot afford protective \n\ngadgets because they are expensive. Some work in environment with very high dust or \n\nnoise levels, under the scorching sun or extremely high or cold temperatures. Some are \n\nexposed to dangerous chemicals, vibration and excessive lighting. They are thus exposed to \n\nall forms of diseases such as typhoid, malaria, and other forms of occupational diseases. \n\nThis sicknesses if not handled as early as possible can cause death to this informal workers. \n\n \n\n1.4  Conclusion \n\nThe much talked about economic growth has not created enough jobs for the people \n\nof Ghana. Unfortunately, these gains have not also reflected in the expansion of formal \n\nsector or in improving the lives of its people. The question is what is economic growth \n\nwithout improvements in the livelihood of the citizenry? Almost all the productive sectors \n\nof the economy witnessed growth in recent years led by the service sector, yet, there are \n\nstill growing informality, which shows that the growth of the economy is not linked to job \n\ncreation that has the potential of reducing poverty, reducing informality as well as reduction \n\nin the high growth of rural-urban migration.  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n26 \n\n \n\nThe country over the years has been dependent on import oriented policies, this I \n\nbelieve need to be reversed. Ghana exports its products to the international market in it raw \n\nstate, no value added, this call for government to embark on public investment policies that \n\ncan establish industries to add value to our products before exporting them. By this more \n\njob opportunities can be created to bring down unemployment and informality. One \n\nimportant area is the Agricultural sector that has not receive attention in the area of  \n\ntechnology and mechanization, the country still rely heavily on rainfall for cultivation, no \n\nirrigation programs for farmers to improve their methods of farming, no better road \n\ninfrastructure from farming areas to market centers. This has brought a lot of hardship to \n\nthe rural areas whose major occupation is agriculture, contributing to the issues of poverty \n\nand migration to the cities to search for decent jobs, but end up in the informal sector for \n\nsurvival. Lack of rural development, infrastructural deficit and low productivity in the rural \n\nareas has resulted in the high level of migration to the urban areas. The government and \n\npolicy makers need to address these issues to encourage reduction in the high urban \n\ninformality in the country. \n\n Informal sector as we can see from the above information stands at 86.2%, of the \n\nlabour force in the country which has the tendency of retiring the development that is \n\nexpected. The lack of formal job opportunities in the country and especially in the urban \n\nareas has resulted in the country\u2019s huge informality. To address this situation, government \n\nand policy makers should put in more public investment initiatives aiming at creating jobs \n\nby moving the country to the era of industrialization and also encourage more of the \n\ninformal enterprises that have the potential of formalizing to do so. However, the issue of \n\nformalization has been dealt with in the second chapter. \n\nThe government and policy makers need to look at how the informal sector can be \n\nincluded in the national account of the country through strategies for formalization and tax \n\npayment. In spite of the informal sector\u00b4s contribution to the Ghanaian economy, most of \n\nthe informal sector workers live in a very deplorable condition such as housing, health, \n\neducation and sanitation.  In order for the informal sector to contribute meaningfully to the \n\nnation in the area of taxation, government should implement public policies to improve the \n\nconditions within which this entrepreneurs and workers find themselves. Again, public \n\ninvestment in the area of building more schools, health facilities, roads etc. will help to \n\n\n\n \n \n\n27 \n\n \n\ncreate job opportunities for the informal workers that can encourage them to pay more \n\nincome taxes. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n29 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 2: SMALL AND MICRO ENTERPRISES, FORMALIZATION AND \n\nINTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCES \n\n \n\nThe focus of the chapter two is to identify the structure and the dynamics of the \n\nSmall and Micro Scale Enterprises (SMEs) in Ghana and government policies to support \n\nthem. The chapter will further discuss the formalization process of businesses in Ghana; \n\nsome international experiences with focus on Brazil, the chapter will end with an Indian \n\npositive impact of a tax reform for small businesses. \n\n \n\n2.1: Structure and Dynamics of the SMES in Ghana and Government Policies \n\nSMEs in most developing countries accounts for a greater share of employments. It \n\nhas also been accepted by many economies that SMEs are important pillars of economic \n\ngrowth and development because they encourage entrepreneurship, generate employments \n\nand reduce poverty.  \n\nBut in capitalist economies, industrialization and development process depends \n\nheavily on the ability to accumulate capital, finance and technological development, \n\ncentralization of financial capital, and the large-scale production, range of domestic and \n\ninternational markets, which are promoted mainly by large companies. Thus, rhythm, \n\ndynamic and diverse conditions that define the performance space of micro and small \n\nenterprises are determined by the dynamics of big businesses. The expansion of more \n\nmodern and organized micro and small businesses, therefore, depends on their links with \n\nthe large and medium enterprise - national and international - generally showing a \n\nrelationship of subordination: as a subcontractor; producer of raw materials; supplier of \n\nparts, parts and components; service provider; distributors of the products produced by \n\nlarge companies; dependent on the dynamics of income and employment created by \n\nmedium and large scale enterprises to expand their markets and sales of products and \n\nservices to household (Santos, 2013). \n\nTherefore, to support small businesses, it is necessary that the country has a \n\ndynamic of growth driven by medium and large company, with the government supporting \n\nthe productive, technological, financial (credit) development, research, exports of large and \n\nmedium-sized enterprise as a form of open space, expand markets for micro and small \n\nenterprises (Santos 2013).  Changes in these directions can help to increase exports at \n\nglobal scale and so on, its means that it is so much important that the developmental \n\n\n\n \n \n\n30 \n\n \n\npolicies of the country should create conditions to promote national medium and big \n\nenterprises who can bring about industrialization.  At the same time, public policies need to \n\nsupport micro and small businesses so that they reduce their organizational and competitive \n\ndisadvantages: reducing bureaucracy; developed support for the qualification of \n\nentrepreneurs and managers programs; favored offering online credits, low interest and \n\nsolving the problems associated with collateral requirements; offering a favored and easy to \n\nperform tax regime; stimulating exports and organizational and technological development; \n\nfacilitating the access of SMEs to government procurement; among other important policies \n\nthat are clearly seen in many countries, including developing and average per capita income \n\ncountries, such as Brazil (Santos 2013). \n\n In order to discuss the various policies that government has put in place to help the \n\nSMEs, there is the need to actually understand its characteristics and the structure in the \n\nGhanaian context. The following is the detailed discussion of SMEs.  \n\nThe SMEs in Ghana is defined by the National Board for Small Scale Industries as, \n\nenterprises that employs not more than 29 workers, with investment in plant and machinery \n\n(excluding land and Buildings) not exceeding the equivalent of US$100,000. \n\nThe Venture Capital  Trust Fund Act (Act 680, 2004) in section 28 has also defined \n\nthe SMEs as an industry , project, undertaking or economic activity which employs not \n\nmore than 100 persons and whose total asset base, excluding land and Buildings does not \n\nexceed the cedi equivalent of US$1million in value. Another important sector in the \n\nGhanaian economy is the Ghana Statistical Service, which has also defined the SMEs as \n\nfirms which employs between 5 and 29 employees and with fixed assets not exceeding \n\nUS$100,000 as small scale and those employing between 30 and 99 employees as medium \n\nscale.  \n\nFrom the above definition of the sector, it shows that there are two ways in which \n\nthe SMEs can be identified, either by the number of employees or the total value of the \n\nfirms fixed assets. Since there can be challenges regarding the use of the fixed asset values \n\nin the area of uniform valuation, Ghana in practice uses the number of employees to define \n\nand identify its SMEs (Boon, 1989).  \n\nIn Ghana, SMEs are heterogeneous in nature; they operate from small workshops \n\nmaking furniture, metal fabrications and dress making to medium sized manufacturing of \n\nmachinery as well as service providers in restaurants, consultancy and computer or ICT \n\n\n\n \n \n\n31 \n\n \n\nfirms.  Some enterprises within the SMEs are operated for survival of families and so does \n\nnot poses growth potentials whiles some are also highly growth oriented in their operations. \n\nThe SMEs can also be considered as urban or rural enterprises, the urban enterprises \n\ncan further be subdivided into organized and unorganized enterprises. The organized \n\nenterprises tends to have employees with a registered office and mostly solely owned  by an \n\nindividual (self-employed) with small employees, whiles the unorganized enterprises are \n\nmostly made up of artisans who work in open spaces, operate in temporal  structures or at \n\nthe residences of the owners and also employ very small or no salaried workers. They \n\nmostly use family members or apprentices in their work. The rural enterprises on the other \n\nhand, are mainly family groups, very small and operate mainly for survival, they are \n\nengaged in individual artisans, women in food processing, soap making and detergents, \n\nfabrics, clothing (Batik tie and dye), tailoring textile and leather works, blacksmiths, timber \n\nand small scale mining etc. (Kayanula and Quartey, 2000). Majority of SME entrepreneurs \n\nand workers have very low education background and other necessary training that are very \n\nimportant in their business. Because of the self-employment nature of the sector, the \n\nconcept of separation in accounting does not hold, many uses their personal account as \n\nbusiness account, which possess several problems for them. \n\nThe contribution of the SMEs to the Ghanaian economy cannot be overlooked; \n\nmany governments\u2019 programmes have regarded the SMEs as the engine of growth of the \n\neconomy, seeing the sector as possessing Ghana\u2019s transformation key (Ayimah-Ackah, \n\n2006).  It is for this reason that the government must assist the sector to grow by \n\nimplementing policies that seeks to concentrate on growing the sector to take advantage of \n\nthe potentials they are made off. \n\nSMEs in Ghana are estimated to account for about 93%t of all registered businesses \n\nin the country, playing very important role by offering employment opportunities, opening \n\nof new businesses, enhancing entrepreneurship and fostering creativity among many other \n\nthings. They are said to constitute about 85% of all manufacturing employments in the \n\ncountry and also contribute 70% of GDP.\n10\n\n  In terms of developments, the SME sector is \n\nrecognized as the engine through which the growth objectives of many developing \n\ncountries rest (Kayanula and Quartey, 2000).  They provide the potential source of \n\n                                                           \n10\n\n This was contained in an article published on \n\nwww.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=246015 (accessed on 26/05/14). \n\nhttp://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=246015\n\n\n \n \n\n32 \n\n \n\nemployment and income for many people.  This sector apart from job creation, many of \n\nthem also pay taxes, brings innovations as well as leading the global trade of many \n\neconomies including Ghana. \n\n \n\nAccording to the 2003 National Industrial Census, SMEs in Ghana constitute the \n\ngreater percent of all businesses (96%), out of total firm units of 26,493. The Medium and \n\nLarge firms share the rest by 2.9% and 1.1% respectively. In terms of employment \n\ngeneration, SMEs employs 47.6% of all employees, in the country (see table 7 below) \n\n \n\nTable 7: Employment Distribution of MSMEs in Ghana, 2003. \n\nFirm Size Total Units Total Employees Average No. \n\nWorkers/ Unit \n\n NO. % No. %  \n\nMicro 14,438 54.5 36,031 13.1 2 \n\nSmall 10,990 41.5 94,928 34.5 9 \n\nMedium 762 2.9 36,551 13.3 48 \n\nLarge 303 1.1 107,988 39.2 356 \n\nTotal 26,493 100 275,498 100 -- \n\nSource: National Industrial Census report, and cited by the Korea Knowledge sharing   program, 2003. \n\n \n\n \n\nSMEs in Ghana face a lot of challenges in their businesses. Majority of SMEs \n\nentrepreneurs lack the requisite knowledge and training in managing their businesses \n\n(Baah, 2006). Although there are institutions providing training and advisory services for \n\nthese SMEs, many have not taking advantage of the opportunities. In view of the fact that \n\nmany SMEs are self-employed or owner managed businesses, they do not see the need to \n\nemploy the services of qualified managers to help them due to the perceived high cost \n\ninvolve. Those who posses some level of skills also do not adopt the right attitude in their \n\nwork, by not putting in their maximum effort towards the growth of their businesses. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n33 \n\n \n\nMany SMEs are not able to compete with the foreign products in the Ghanaian \n\nmarket. The reliance of foreign products to the neglect of the local produced once has put a \n\nlot of pressure on the efficiency, prices, consumer satisfaction as well as quality of the local \n\nproduct. This situation has created low share of SMEs in the Ghanaian market.  The trade \n\nliberalization adopted as part of the Structural Adjustment Programme has also contributed \n\nto this trend.  \n\nThe growing technological advancement in the business environment has become a \n\nhug challenge for small businesses in Ghana (Duan et al, 2002). The inability of SMEs to \n\nlearn and use technology in their line of business has eroded them from benefiting from it. \n\nWith the changes in technology, many SMEs appear to be unfamiliar with new \n\ntechnologies even if they have the skill. However, those who have acquired the knowledge \n\nin ICT are reaping the benefit of their investments. \n\nThe issues of bureaucracies and high cost of starting businesses in Ghana is a major \n\nchallenge for SMEs. They see the registration process as burdensome to undertake all in the \n\nname of regulations, these has impeded grow of many business and has also left some in \n\nthe informal sector. The high cost and legalities in clearing goods especially raw materials \n\nfrom the port are also a big problem. There is the need for government to address these \n\nissues that have the possibility of retarding the growth of many SMEs. If government or \n\npolicy makers will take steps to reduce the high cost associated with registration and \n\nobtaining regulation and legal assistance for small businesses in the country, it will go a \n\nlong way to encourage formalization of many informal businesses.  \n\nOn the heart of the many challenges faced by SMEs in Ghana is the issue of access \n\nto credit and financing mechanisms. Access to credit in the area of working capital and raw \n\nmaterials is a huge problem creating a lot of bottlenecks in the growth of many small \n\nbusinesses. They have very limited access in obtaining credit from the capital market either \n\nlocally or internationally, largely because of the perception of high risk in the SMEs \n\nbusiness. Other areas have to do with management weakness, barriers to information and \n\nhigh cost of intermediation for small firms. One other important element in this issue of \n\nfinance is the lack of adequate collateral to secure loans from the banks. Banks always \n\ndemand for collateral in place of the risk that surrounds the small business operations so \n\nthat they can recover their monies in case of default.  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n34 \n\n \n\nAccording to Cuevas et al (1993, p.24), the lack of clear title to much useable land \n\nin Ghana, has posse limited amount of real property that can be put up as collateral. Since \n\nmany of the lands in Ghana are stool or family lands, usage of it as collateral for advance \n\nfrom financial institutions is restricted. Delays by authorities in finalizing mortgages, where \n\ntitles are available with regards to regulations also impede access to loans. This situations \n\nonly leave the entrepreneur to rely on family, friends or to the informal financial markets \n\nthat offer very expensive advances in terms of interest rate. \n\nThe lack of expansion by many private sector firms in Ghana is mainly attributable \n\nto this challenge of finance and access to credit. It is for this reason that the government \n\nneed to come to their aid to help small businesses to raise the necessary funding for \n\nanticipated expansion or growth. \n\nIn the quest for the support of SMEs in Ghana, the government in 1981 passed the \n\nlaw to establish a Board to look at the promotion of this sector in its expansion and growth \n\npotentials.\n11\n\n The need for greater contribution to employment creation and development of \n\nthe economy was identified in the Ghanaian MSMEs at the time and it\u2019s still considered \n\nimportant. The Act 434 (Act 1981) became operationalized in 1985 with the establishment \n\nof National Board for Small Scale Industries as the apex body to coordinate the activities of \n\nthe MSMEs in the country as has been said earlier. The coming into being of the NBSSI \n\nmerged there then, Ghanaian Enterprises Development Commission (GEDC) and the \n\nCottage Industries Division of the Department of Rural Housing and Cottage Industries, \n\nthis merges was to have a single body responsible for the development of MSMEs in the \n\ncountry. \n\nThe NBSSI was mandated to look at two broad needs of the sector, the Financial \n\nand the Non-financial needs. The Financial services included extending credit through its \n\nloan schemes to entrepreneurs for both working capital and the acquisition of fixed assets. \n\nThe interest rates of these loans were to be lower than that of the open market (Banks) with \n\nflexible repayment periods of monthly installments. Due to the fact that small-scale \n\nentrepreneurs do not have collateral as security for loans from the financial market, \n\naccessing the loans from the board only requires a personal guarantee. \n\n                                                           \n11\n\n All information about the operations of the MSMEs can be access from the web page of the NBSSI \nhttp://www.nbssi.org/AboutUs.aspx?PageId=16 \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.nbssi.org/AboutUs.aspx?PageId=16\n\n\n \n \n\n35 \n\n \n\nThe board functions on the following areas to help the development of MSMEs in \n\nGhana: \n\n? \u201cFacilitation of access to enabling environment through the provision of \n\nrelevant market information, providing explanation on government policies and procedures \n\nand help the entrepreneur fulfill all regulatory requirements, information on incentives and \n\ninvestment opportunities available to the entrepreneurs. Last but not the least in this \n\ncategory is to assist entrepreneurs to exhibit the products at both local and international \n\nfairs by acquiring space for them\u201d. This will help to strengthen the information that they \n\nneed to know in order to make the right choices regarding their growth and expansion. \n\n? \u201cFacilitating access to credit through the provision of advice and direction to \n\nentrepreneurs, assisting entrepreneurs to locate sources of funding and working with them \n\non their applications. Another way is helping the entrepreneurs to streamline their \n\naccounting and business records and ensuring credit delivery and recovery\u201d. Access to \n\ncredit is a very major need of the MSMEs; this will enable them to expand their business \n\nbecause they do not have a very high capital outlay to operate without credit. \n\n? \u201cTraining and counseling, training of entrepreneurs in the sector is very \n\nimportant, the board provide training in the area of: management development skills, \n\nmarketing practices, information on local and foreign markets, choice of equipment, \n\nbusiness plan preparation, assist in feasibility studies, problem solving techniques and help \n\nentrepreneurs to identify their strength and weakness in their field of business\u201d. Due to the \n\nlow level of education by most of the entrepreneurs, these trainings are designed to equip \n\nthem to function properly and also make them ready to compete with the outside world. \n\n? \u201cSupport for business associations, in Ghana there are many business owners \n\nwho come together to form associations to help assist each other. The board has programs \n\nto support these associations to achieve their aims in the areas of: promoting and strengthen \n\ntheir business, offer training to their executives and strengthen their operational capabilities \n\nas well as helping the associations to determine their goals and objectives\u201d.  In Ghana the \n\nphenomenon of groups and associations are very common, so reaching them will help the \n\nboard to cover a large number of people at a time. \n\nThe board also has specific programs for the rural dwellers by name the Rural \n\nEnterprises Project. The NBSSI through its district offices in the rural areas offer assistance \n\nto enterprises in these areas by: given entrepreneurs literacy and numeracy training, \n\n\n\n \n \n\n36 \n\n \n\nbusiness orientation seminars, community based training to impart basic level skills in \n\nsimple activities like soap making, mushroom growing, etc. Another area is assisting in \n\nsmall business management training and counseling.  Finally in an attempt to link rural \n\nenterprise to their urban counterpart, the board offers them marketing support that will \n\nequip them to compete favorably in any market they find themselves.  \n\nThe board has revived its credit scheme aiming at supporting SMEs who have \n\nregistered with the Registrar General\u2019s Department (RGD), Credit Unions and the NBSSI \n\nitself with an amount of 10 million Ghana Cedis from the Export Trading, Agriculture and \n\nIndustrial Development Fund (EDAIF). The support is also to encourage agro-processing \n\nenterprises that have export potentials. \n\n \n\n2.2 Formalizing the Informal Sector and SMEs  \n\nThe issue of formalization is always at the heart of discussions of the informal \n\nsector, which has been very difficult to achieve by many developing countries. Chen, M.A. \n\n(2007), has put it that it is not clear what is meant by \u201cformalization\u201d, thus in order to \n\naddress the issue, there is the need for clearer understanding of what is formalization.  \n\nNelson and De Bruijn (2005, p.579), has defined formalization to mean \u201cgraduating \n\nfrom the informal sector to the formal sector, either directly or via semi-formal status\u201d, \n\nindeed, not all informal enterprises can be graduated into the formal but, those with the \n\npotential and the capacity for growth.   \n\nSome policymakers in the world over views the subject of formalization as a means \n\nof informal sector enterprises or entrepreneurs, getting or obtaining license, registering their \n\nbusinesses and paying taxes. But the question is asked about the benefit the businesses will \n\nobtain when formalized.  There is a comprehensive approach to the issue of formalizing the \n\ninformal sector which affects both the informal enterprises and the informal jobs (WIEGO, \n\n2012). \n12\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                           \n12\n\n It must be noted that the focus of this thesis in on the informal enterprises which operate as a modern \n\ncapitalist, because this section of operatives makes profits which needs to be assessed for taxes to be paid. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n37 \n\n \n\nBox 1: Formalization of the Informal Economy: A comprehensive Approach \n\n \n\n1.

The issues as I posed earlier is that what \n\nbenefit is derived when moving from informal business or firm to formal? I however, agree \n\nto the fact that formalization has different dimensions beyond just registering and paying \n\ntaxes (WIEGO, 2012). Box (1) above has outlined the benefits informal sector enterprises \n\nseek in the area of receiving legal and social protection enjoyed by the formal firms and \n\nformal workers. The various tax holidays and tax incentive packages\n13\n\n being enjoyed by the \n\nformal firms or businesses can be a very important encouragement for enterprises operating \n\ninformally to think of moves towards formal operations. The other issue is allowing them to \n\norganize and to have representative voice in rule-setting and policy making processes and \n\nmore. \n\nIn fact, these dissertation agree to those who have come out to state that \n\nformalization is not a one-step process, but rather an on-going process of extending benefits \n\nof formalization incrementally to the informal sector, this should be greatly be recognized \n\nby policy-makers on various dimensions. \n\nAccording to, Wedderburn et. al, (p.11), in a paper captioned \u201cThe informal \n\neconomy in Jamaica: Is it feasible to tax this sector? \u201cThe following outlined points are \n\nways of ensuring that the informal sector in Jamaica operates formally in order to \n\ncontribute significantly to the official recorded economic growth. The paper underscores \n\nthe fact that: \n\n \n\n1) \u201cBusiness registrations be simplified \n\n2) Improvement of social programs \n\n3) Equity in the tax system \n\n4) Confidence in the tax administration\u201d \n\n \n\nWould encourage moves towards formalization. In this sense, is also important to \n\nadd that simplifying the tax system by making it easy for businesses and individuals to \n\naccess can be more important to encourage formalization than reduction in the tax. The \n\nexample of the Brazilian experience below can be considered. \n\n                                                           \n13\n\n Sections 10 and 11 of the internal revenue act, Act 592 as amended has provided a number of these \n\nexemptions and industrial concessions for business but can only be enjoyed if you operate formally. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n39 \n\n \n\nTo further appreciate the need for a greater reduction in informal activities in most \n\ndeveloping countries, Uganda in a research has alluded to the fact that when informal sector \n\nis formalized, the country\u2019s chances of expanding employment opportunities, increase \n\ngovernment tax revenue as well as raising income of participant in the economy is very \n\nhigh (Muwonge et.el,2007 p.28). Formalization of informal enterprises tend to be cost to \n\nthe entrepreneurs, they see the fact that they have to be licensed, register their accounts and \n\nalso to pay taxes (or social contribution) as not a benefit but a cost (Chen, 2005).  \n\nThe informal entrepreneur is interested in the benefit that is accrued to him or her \n\nfor moving from informal to operating formally, they look forward to receiving such \n\nbenefit as: enforceable commercial contracts; legal ownership of their place of businesses \n\nand means of production; tax breaks and incentive packages to increase their \n\ncompetitiveness; membership in trade associations; and statutory social protections, access \n\nto government contracts. The informal wage workers also seek converting their current \n\nemployment status into formal jobs; obtain new formal jobs; have a secured employment \n\ncontracts, worker benefits and social protection as the benefit of formalization (Chen, \n\n2005). In order to ensure that formalization is achieved, the benefits should be made clear \n\nto the operatives in the informal sector by so doing the will be willing to voluntarily \n\nformalized their businesses. The bottom line is for both informal self-employed persons and \n\ninformal wage workers to see a reduction in the cost or the challenge of working informal \n\nto increasing the benefit associated with operating formally. \n\nFinally, Chen, 2005, p.90-91, makes three important conclusions to the \n\nformalization debate apart from the issues of cost reduction and increased benefit to the \n\ninformal enterprises and workers. To her in as much as there are campaigns for \n\nformalization of all enterprises and workers in the sector there are also constraints that will \n\nimpede the process, these constraints are; 1) \u00b4\u00b4bureaucracies would not be able to handle \n\nthe volume of license applications and tax forms to be processed by the authorities, `` thus, \n\ninformal entrepreneurs would not be prepared to spend a lot of time waiting before they \n\ncommence their businesses. 2) \u00b4\u00b4Most bureaucracies would claim they cannot afford to \n\noffer informal businesses the incentives and benefits that formal businesses receive``, thus, \n\nauthorities are looking at the increasing cost of benefits to formal businesses. And 3) \u00b4\u00b4there \n\nare not enough jobs to absorb the growth in employment``, meaning formal job seekers are \n\nmuch more than available job vacancies. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n40 \n\n \n\n \n\nIn Ghana businesses are expected to first of all register with the local authorities\n14\n\n to \n\nenable them obtain a license or permits to operate. The licenses are issued for specific trade \n\nor services and so the cost is lower and it\u2019s a little simpler in processing. The revenues \n\ngenerated from this registration is used for rural and community development. The second \n\nstage of the process is to register a unique business name with the Registrar Generals\u2019 \n\nDepartment (RGD)\n15\n\n which will issue the certificate to commence business as well as the \n\ncertificate of incorporation (in the case of Limited liability Company). As part of efforts to \n\nencourage formalization in the country, government has established institutions to offer \n\ntechnical and financial support to the informal entrepreneurs (Self-employed). Some of the \n\ninstitutions are: \n\n  \n\n? National Board for Small Scale Industries (NBSSI) \n\n? National Vocational Training Institute (NVTI) \n\n? Micro Finance and Small Loans Center (MASLOC) \n\n? Venture Capital Fund (VCF) \n\n? Ghana Chamber of Commerce and Industries (GCCI) \n\nIn order for these informal enterprises to access the various support and assistance \n\navailable to them, they are first of all required to register with the Registrar General\u00b4s \n\nDepartment to obtain all the necessary certificates or to obtain business operating permit \n\nfrom the local authorities. And also they are required to register with the Ghana Revenue \n\nAuthority with the issuance of their taxpayer identification numbers, file their tax returns \n\nand ensure that they meet their tax obligation (if any). Aside the above, self-employed \n\nbusinesses who have registered with the revenue authority are entitled to various tax reliefs \n\nat the end of the year after filing their tax returns. The Section 39 (1) of the Internal \n\nRevenue Act, 2000, Act 592 as amended states that, \u00b4\u00b4the assessable income of an \n\nindividual for a year of assessment shall be reduced by the following tax reliefs``. The \n\ncurrent tax reliefs available to individuals can be observed in the table 8. \n\n                                                           \n14\n\n In Ghana these local authorities are known as the Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies. \n15\n\n The RGD is the organization in charge of registration of all nature in Ghana; businesses, properties etc... \n\n\n\n \n \n\n41 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 8: Personal Income Tax Reliefs, 2002 and 2013 \n\nTax Relief Annual Rate 2002 Annual Rate 2013 \n\nMarriage  GH\u00a230,00 GH\u00a2100,00 \n\nOld Age GH\u00a230,00 GH\u00a2100,00 \n\nChildren Education  GH\u00a224 up to 3 dependents  GH\u00a2100 up to 3 dependents \n\nAged Dependent GH\u00a220 up to 2 dependents GH\u00a2 50,00 up to 2 \n\ndependents \n\nMarginal  GH\u00a2120,00 GH\u00a21,584,00 \n\nDisability 25% of assessable income 25% of assessable income \n\nSource: GRA Regulations \n\n \n\n \n\nThe major constraints in this registration process are the cost and the procedure \n\ninvolved, this situation has been confirmed by the World Bank Doing Business report for \n\n2013\n16\n\n, where Ghana is ranked 64 as an economy that has not created conducive regulatory \n\nenvironment for doing business. In the area of starting business, Ghana is ranked 128 in \n\n2013 from 111 in the previous report, which means the country is making reforms that are \n\ndifficult for people to register and do business, this create incentive for people to operate \n\ninformally. Again, from the same report, Ghana is ranked 7 out of 10 score in its \n\nprocedures involved in registering business in the country, which also indicate difficult \n\nbureaucratic procedure for businesses. \n\nEven though, various support and assistance initiatives have been provided, the \n\ndifficulties the informal sector operatives go through to formalize is discouraging them to \n\ndo so, hence, their continuing stay in the informal sector.  \n\n                                                           \n16\n\n http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploreeconomies/ghana/#starting-a-business \n \n \n \n\nhttp://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploreeconomies/ghana/#starting-a-business\n\n\n \n \n\n42 \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3  The International Experience \n\nIn order to learn some lessons from what other countries have done in the area of \n\nformalization of businesses that has reduced informality, the Brazilian experience is \n\nconsidered below as well as that of Liberia and India. \n\nDuring the Lula government, the system for encouraging small and micro \n\nbusinesses to formalize was further extended to a larger set of segments, with its \n\nreplacement by Simples Nacional, also known as Super Simple. According to Leone \n\n(2010),  \n\nIn an attempt to increase the creation of formal employment and reduce business costs \n\nthe Federal government implemented the Simple (Law of Micro and Small \n\nEnterprises), approved by Law No. 9,317 of 05.12.1996 , which provides a special \n\nregime for small companies with sales of up to 36 thousand dollars a year. The single \n\nwas abolished on 1\nst\n  July, 2007 and replaced by the National Singles and Super \n\nsimples laying down general rules on the differential tax treatment to be accorded to \n\nmicroenterprises and small businesses within the Union, States, Federal District and \n\nMunicipalities upon single system of collection, including ancillary obligations  \n\n(http://www.portaltributario.com.br accessed 26/06/2010).  \n\nDespite the Simple System contributing to the formalization of small businesses and \n\ntheir employees, their rules mainly benefit small businesses with a better degree of \n\norganization. So, to reach small businesses with lower level of organization,  usually  \n\nindividual entrepreneurs with help from family work - with a small number of employees - \n\nthe Brazilian government created in 2008, the Law of Micro Entrepreneur Individual (MEI) \n\n(Santos 2012). \n\nIn Brazil, very small businesses are formalized through registration as either \n\nIndividual Micro-Entrepreneur (MEI - Microempreendedor Individual).\n17\n\n MEI allows the \n\noperatives to formalize their status, equally and also allows them to obtain a National \n\nRegistration of Legal Entities [CNPJ \u2013 Cadastro National de Pessoa Juridical] and pension \n\ncoverage. However, to become an Individual Entrepreneur, it is necessary to raise a \n\nmaximum turnover of R$60,000 per annum. By law the individual cannot participate in \n\n                                                           \n17\n\n The information on the Brazil Experience was accessed from \n\nhttp://www.portaldoempreendedor.gov.br/how-to-open-business-in-brazil/types-of-companies-in-brazil  \n\nhttp://www.portaltributario.com.br/\nhttp://www.portaldoempreendedor.gov.br/how-to-open-business-in-brazil/types-of-companies-in-brazil\n\n\n \n \n\n43 \n\n \n\nanother company as a partner, director or holder, nor have more than a single employee\n18\n\n. \n\nRegistration of these businesses is free and it is done on the internet, also some accounting \n\nfirms undertake the registration for the entrepreneurs with no cost. Registration offers the \n\nindividual entrepreneur access to open a bank account, access to bank loans and invoice \n\nissuance\n19\n\n. Entrepreneurs in more than 400 activities can join MEI, and they can also be \n\nemployed in another firm (SEBRAE, 2011). The micro businesses shall be exempt from \n\nfederal taxes (Income tax, and other charges and social contribution on the payroll). One \n\nonly pay a fixed monthly amount of R$34.10 (Trade or Industry), R$38.90 (services-\n\nrelated) or R$39.90 (trade and Services), which will be allocated to social security and to \n\nICMS (a kind of VAT) or to ISS (tax on service sector). The amount is annually updated in \n\naccordance with the minimum wage. Paying this monthly amount, the entrepreneur enjoys \n\nsocial security benefits including maternity-leave, sick-leave, retirement, among others.  \n\nAfter registration, the following charges are paid: 5% of the minimum wage as \n\nsocial security; R$1.00 to the state if business activity is Commercial or industrial and \n\nR$5.00 for the municipality if business activity is service related\n20\n\n. Since its launch in \n\nJanuary 2009, about four million businesses have been formalized by these new policies. \n\nThe impacts of the MEI were very positive on formalization, as highlighted by Santos \n\n(2012),  \n\n... At least informal units associated with lack of social security contributions, CNPJ, \n\npermits and other forms of legal recognition and licensing ... made substantial progress \n\nwith the progressive advance of the registration of entrepreneurs and self-employed in \n\nMEI.  \u2026 Participation in MEI is only possible with the hiring of at most one employee. \n\nHowever, not only by the possibility of formalizing employers with a single employee, \n\nbut also by the fact that these perspectives opened by formalizing stimulated by MEI \n\nwill take many entrepreneurs to join in future the Super simples and thus placing \n\n                                                           \n18 According to Santos (2012), when fit on the Super Simple, \"your employee becomes entitled to pension \n\nbenefits, eg, retirement, unemployment insurance, aid for accidents or sickness, maternity leave. All other \n\nlabor rights of the employee are also held for the regime of MEI.  \n19\n\n Along with a wide-ranging set of benefits for entrepreneurs formalized by MEI, according to Santos (2012) \n\nthis program has also \"facilitated access to the banking system and differential credit, issuing invoices, \n\nparticipate in government procurement and bidding consortia, have formalized an employee with a yield of 1 \n\nMW or wage ', besides having a procurement employee at a lower cost (only 3% of social security \n\ncontributions on wages). The registration also entitles you to receive provisional operating license for 180 \n\ndays, simplified accounting procedures, participation in consortia specific for carrying out joint procurement \n\npurposes. Besides, the EI has access to a streamlined electronic system for issuing guides ever with payment \n\nvalues calculated by the system (Santos, 2012). \n20\n\n The entire amounts stated are paid monthly and the payment is via the internet by the 20\nth\n\n of each month.  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n44 \n\n \n\nthemselves in a situation of full potential employer, the impacts of the broad process of \n\nregistration in the MEI already contributes and, over time, will further contribute to the \n\nformalization of the informal group of employers, i.e., to reduce informality not only in \n\nthe universe of own account workers, but also  for employers.\u201d \n\n Formalization has reached many businesses with fixed premises, as well as those \n\nwithout fixed location or category, such as street vendors: Santos (2012) shows that \"quite \n\nsurprisingly, the total subscribers in MEI, most IEs develop their activities in fixed \n\nestablishments, that proportion reaches 56.4% for the whole country. This indicates that the \n\nMEI is serving as a way to formalize proportionally more small businesses who are already \n\nestablished (and probably in better condition) in less developed regions, in areas where the \n\nsize of establishments, sales and the level of organization and productivity seem to be in \n\nneed of further support of public policies for their formalization (SANTOS, 2011). The \n\nformalization of IEs developing activities without fixed location or property (street, door to \n\ndoor etc...) appears as the second most important activity in this process of formalization by \n\nMEI, reaching 21% of total EIs formalized throughout the country.\" \n\nFrom the above description on how businesses are formalized in Brazil, it shows \n\nthat, there is no cost involve and the process is also less bureaucratic with the use of \n\ninternet, providing an incentive for once informal businesses to become formal as well as \n\nproviding a future through the benefit of social security after one\u2019s active working age.  \n\nIn Liberia, greater number of the informal sector enterprises have the desire to be \n\nformalized in order to avoid the many payment of unofficial money\u2019s they pay to \n\nauthorities illegally, yet there are a lot of bottleneck to be addressed. Unlike many \n\ndeveloping countries, where formalization of informal sector is being enforced, in Liberia \n\ngovernments are reluctant in enforcing the need for formalization of the sector, because it \n\nsees the sector as an employment incentive in the countries post war era. And also believe \n\nthat interfering with the informal sector will derail the peaceful environment the country \n\nfinds itself now.\n21\n\n Aside the fact that the government is not enforcing the issue of \n\n                                                           \n21\n\n This was contained in a policy briefing by Alfred K. Tarway-Twalla (Factors Influencing Contribution of \n\nInformal Business to Private Sector Development in Liberia.  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n45 \n\n \n\nformalization, in a related survey\n22\n\n  the informal operatives in Liberia expressed their \n\nwillingness to voluntarily formalize their businesses if the following issues are addressed: \n\n \n\nI. Lack of Information on how to Formalize their businesses \n\nII. Burdensome procedures to formalization - the informal sector operatives who have \n\nmade various attempt at formalizing by registering with the authority complain of \n\nburdensome procedures as well as it been expensive for them and however, does not \n\nencourage them to complete the process. \n\nIII. The issue of high income tax payment, high compliance cost and social \n\ncontributions associated with the formal sector, that they avoid also serves as \n\nmotivation for them to remain informal. \n\nThe Liberian situation is a very unique one in the sense that, this is post war \n\neconomy that lost a lot of its formal working life and is now building it. Hence, the \n\ngovernment reason for not interfering with the peace by enforcing programs on the \n\ninformal sector is legitimate. According to the world Bank 2013 doing business report, the \n\ncountry is ranked 38 out of 185 countries in the area of starting business, also it has the \n\nhighest ranking among the ECOWAS countries. \n\nIn India (Bihar), they undertook a tax reform aiming at improving tax compliance of \n\nthe Micro and Small businesses through simplification of tax laws and procedures to reduce \n\ncompliance issues as well as to encourage small businesses to register as taxpayers\n23\n\n. \n\nAccording to an article on \u201cSimplifying Tax Compliance for small firms, Improving \n\nBusiness Climate\u201d the reforms has brought a lot of improvement in tax payment and has \n\nalso widen the tax base with improved business climate. The following were some of the \n\nreforms undertaking: \n\n \n\n? \u201cAdopting of several progressive measures by the use of fixed tax rate for micro and \n\nsmall enterprises with no or less routine scrutiny. \n\n? Improving online filing of tax returns for larger enterprises \n\n                                                           \n22\n\n Survey on the theme Small Business Taxation: Is this the Key to Formalization? By Richard Stern and Jan \n\nLeoprick. \n23\n\n The reforms was initiated by the International Finance Corporation from 2009 to \n\n2013http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/1dc55500437d35118397bb869243d457/Small+and+medium+enter\n\nprises.pdf?MOD=AJPERES (accessed on 26/05/2014).  \n\nhttp://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/1dc55500437d35118397bb869243d457/Small+and+medium+enterprises.pdf?MOD=AJPERES\nhttp://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/1dc55500437d35118397bb869243d457/Small+and+medium+enterprises.pdf?MOD=AJPERES\n\n\n \n \n\n46 \n\n \n\n? Simplified admission of appeals \n\n? Faster resolutions and payment of refunds to taxpayers\u201d \n\n The reform project at the end of the period from 2009 to 2013 produced the following \n\nresults: \n\n? \u201cIt recorded 24% increase in the taxpayer base \n\n? Increased the number of tax payers filing their returns online through the e-returns \n\nfrom 149 in 2009 to 22,000 which has brought improvement of about 93% of tax \n\nrevenues collected electronically. \n\n? Last but not the least; it has also recoded increase of registration of small tax payers \n\nto 6,800\u201d  \n\nFinally, to the small enterprises the reforms has lessen the burden in tax compliance \n\nand the ease of doing business has also improved. \n\n \n\nIn concluding for this chapter, we can understand that although the dualism and the \n\npluralism of markets or business are important in an economy, efforts needs to be made to \n\nreduce informality in economies with high percentage of the informal sector. Looking at the \n\nimportance of Small and Micro businesses in the employment structure of the country, \n\nthere is the need for government to come out with concrete polices that will help the \n\ntransition of small businesses into medium and large ones that will have the potential of \n\ngrowth and also change the labour market structure from high informal to a more formal \n\nand job creation oriented one. Also of great importance is the need for expansion of market \n\nfor small businesses that can lead to the promotion of national medium and big enterprises \n\nwith the potential of bringing about the intended anticipation of industrialization. The major \n\nchallenge of these SMEs is the access to credit and finance for expansion, which needs to \n\nbe handled with all seriousness. This challenge has contributed to the high rate of \n\ninformality in the country. Although, the NBSSI is to provide assistance to SMEs in the \n\narea of finance, the processes that this assistance is accessed are cumbersome and \n\ndiscouraging. Efforts needs to be made to re-organize these processes to ensure that the \n\ngoals of the board is achieved to enhance the growth of SMEs in the country. \n\nIn order for Ghana to experience reduction of its high informality, policymakers \n\nmust consider that formalization is a gradual process and not a one-time activity, the need \n\n\n\n \n \n\n47 \n\n \n\nfor reduction in the bureaucratic procedures and increase incentives for registering \n\nbusinesses (i.e. the cost and ease of registration). There is also greater need for the \n\nidentification of those firms or businesses within the informal sector/economy that can be \n\nformalized, because not all businesses within the sector can be formalized, as formalization \n\nof some informal sector businesses is just not justifiable or desirable and could create \n\ngreater hardships to operatives. Both informal enterprises and informal workers will look \n\nout for certain benefits especially in the areas of social protection and formal job openings \n\nbefore taking a decision to formalize.  \n\nThe Brazilian experiences that have made a great impact with reduction in \n\ninformality would have to be considered, by linking social benefits to the payment of taxes \n\nfor small businesses that can result in reduced informality and increase tax revenue. \n\nSimplification of the tax structure in favour of small businesses as has been undertaking by \n\nIndia which has resulted in an increase in the taxpayer base and tax revenue can also be \n\nlooked at seriously. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n49 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3: STRUCTURE OF GHANA\u2019S TAXATION, INFORMAL SECTOR \n\nTAXATION  \n\n \n\n \n\nIn order for the state to fulfill its obligation of providing the needed funds for social \n\nprograms and infrastructure development, taxation revenue is what is required. Taxation is \n\na distributive mechanism for redistributing incomes of the rich population to the poor \n\n(Abdullah, 2008, p.12).  We can agree that it\u2019s a dual responsibility of both the state and the \n\ncitizens that tax is raised as enough as possible. When state\u00b4s raise enough revenue from \n\ntheir own people, it gradually builds the capacity of achieving the fiscal social contract \n\nbetween them. Concentrating and collecting more taxes from the citizenry, will reduce the \n\nreliance on donor funding that comes with a lot of challenges to states, in a form of \n\nconditionality. Because governments would have to apply those donor funds to areas that \n\nthe donors want, this may not be a priority of the state. \n\nEdgar and Sandler (2005) suggest five purpose for which a nation will impose taxes \n\non its citizens, these purposes are: a) to give government power to allocate resources, b) to \n\nenable governments to provide or support social development, c) to stabilize the economy, \n\nd) to constitute and define the market place, e) to encourage optimal economic growth. The \n\nabove purposes are important but it is necessary to consider the important role of tax \n\nrevenue in reducing inequality and eradication of poverty, which will mean looking at the \n\nimportance of a progressive tax system. \n\nIn Ghana, the tax revenue to GDP has decline from an average of 20% between \n\n2004 and 2007, to 17.1% in 2012, of this figure, the self-employed tax which is mainly \n\nfrom the informal sector is less than 5 percent (ISODEC, 2009 and BoG, 2013). It has been \n\nnoted that not all informal enterprises can be formalized and pay tax, because there are \n\noperatives who are generally not capable to do so. This issue is addressed by first looking at \n\nthe various segments of taxpayers and the tax payment of the informal sector.  \n\nThis chapter is dedicated to look at the general tax structure and the various tax \n\ntypes in Ghana as well as a critical assessment of the systems available to tax the informal \n\nsector (self-employed) and their tax payment.  \n\nIn 2009, the government established the GRA as part of the various reforms of the \n\ntax administration of the country. The Ghana Revenue Authority Act 2009, (Act 791) was \n\npassed in December, 2009 to give legal backing to the Authority. This reform was aimed at \n\n\n\n \n \n\n50 \n\n \n\nbringing all the revenue agencies of Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Valued Added Tax \n\nService (VAT), the Custom Excise and Preventive Service (CEPS) as well as the Revenue \n\nAgencies Governing Board (RAGB) under one umbrella to offer a one stop- shop service \n\nfor taxpayers. \n\nThis tax reform marks the possible end of decades of several attempt from 1986 \n\nwhen the Customs, Excise and Preventive Service (CEPS) and the Internal Revenue \n\nService (IRS) was taken out of the civil service and made semi-autonomous self-accounting \n\npublic sector institutions with separate boards, in the same year the National Revenue \n\nSecretariat (NRS) was also established to formulate policies, supervise and manage \n\npossible tax reforms. As a first step of reforms the Value Added Tax Service (VATS) was \n\nreintroduced in the country in 1998 after rejection of the tax and its eventual withdrawal in \n\n1995, the VAT was to administer the various consumption taxes under legal backing of \n\nVAT Act, 1998 (Act, 546) and accompanying Regulations 1998 (LI 1646) with the aim of \n\nwidening the tax net.  \n\nAgain, the Revenue Agencies Governing Board (RAGB) was established in 1998, \n\nwith the passage of RAGB Act, 1998 (Act 558) to abolish the individual boards of the \n\nCEPS, IRS and the VATS. In 2001 the RAGB started its work as the supervisor and the \n\ncoordinator of the RAs. In order to enhance information interchange and risk profiling as \n\npart of the tax reforms of the country, the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) system \n\nwas introduced in 2002 by the passage of Act 632. The RAGB in 2004, recommended for \n\nthe establishment of the Large Taxpayers Unit (LTU) to operate on functional lines to pave \n\nway for the eventual integration of the Revenue Agencies (Ghana Revenue Authority). The \n\nRAGB saw the need to reform the tax administration further by proposing the \n\nestablishment of the GRA to conform to best practice in the world. \n\nThe government of Ghana in order to follow the modern trend of tax administration \n\nwhich focus on functional revenue administration that leads to improved customer delivery \n\nas an alternative to the old aged tax type administration. Many countries in the world \n\nincluding South Africa, Tanzania, Kenya, and United Kingdom, just to mention a few have \n\nall adopted this new trend. The main reason for the establishment of the GRA includes: 1) \n\nto integrate the management of the Domestic tax and the Customs; 2) to modernize \n\nDomestic Tax and Customs operations through the review of processes and procedures; 3) \n\nto integrate IRS, VATS into Domestic Tax operations on functional lines. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n51 \n\n \n\nThe Ghana Revenue Authority has three divisions to enable it achieve its objectives. \n\n? The Domestic Tax Revenue Division (DTRD) consisting of IRS and VATS \n\nwhich is responsible for the administration of both Direct and Indirect taxes such as, \n\nIndividual income tax, Corporate tax, Capital gains tax, Gift tax, Value Added tax, \n\nCommunication Service tax as well as the National Health Insurance Levy. This division is \n\nin charge of collecting taxes from the Self-Employed including the Informal Sector. There \n\nis an office responsible for small taxpayers and field operations, where policies and \n\nprograms to improve the tax collection of small businesses and the informal sector \n\nenterprises emanate from. It is a very important division because of it responsibility to \n\nexpand the tax net to capture many of the informal sector enterprises in the country. \n\n? Custom Division which collect the taxes and perform the duties of the \n\nerstwhile Customs, Excise and Preventive Service (CEPS). Administer taxes and duties at \n\nthe country\u00b4s entry points. \n\n? Support Services Division (SSD) which has brought together all the finance \n\nand the administration functions of the erstwhile Revenue Agencies together. \n\nThe Ghana Revenue Authority seeks to achieve the following: \u201creduce \n\nadministration and tax compliance cost; better service delivery; improved departmental \n\ninformation flow; holistic approach to domestic tax and customs administration; enhance \n\nrevenue mobilization\u201d \n\nTaxation plays a very key role in the economies of nations. It is the socio- economic \n\nbedrock of all nations. Without taxation nations cannot offer any meaningful social benefit \n\nto its citizens. Taxes are the \u201cblood\u201d that runs through the veins of nations. From an \n\nunpublished GRA training material, socio-economic benefit of taxation to a state and its \n\ncitizens can be said to include the following. \n\nTax revenue is the most important source of income to any nation or government. It \n\nis taxation that helps governments to offer social services and infrastructure to its people. \n\nWithout taxation as its being said earlier, the quality of health services, basic education, \n\nroads, transportation, water etc., will suffer, leading to reduction in the level of confidence \n\nthe citizenry have in their nation.  \n\nTaxation also can be used as a tool for equitable distribution of the nation\u2019s income \n\nto its people. Through the institution of a progressive tax system, the rich are made to \n\n\n\n \n \n\n52 \n\n \n\ncontribute more to the \u201ctaxation fund\u201d than the poor. By so doing the government can \n\ndistribute it for the benefit of all citizens. \n\nIt is used as a tool to control inflation or deflation in a country. A spiraling \n\ninflationary situation may be curbed by increasing the incidence of taxation and thus \n\nabsorbing the excess liquidity. A deflationary situation may be controlled by reducing the \n\nincidence of taxation and thereby increasing the volume of money in circulation. \n\n Taxation may be used to foster growth of the key sectors of the economy. Under \n\nthe current tax laws, for instance, in Ghana, manufacturing companies situated in the \n\nRegional capitals other than Accra and Tema enjoys a tax rebate of 25% while those \n\nlocated in non- regional capitals enjoy a tax rebate of 50%.  The law has also made a lot of \n\ntax holidays available to those who are in the Agriculture sector ranging from 5 to 10 years, \n\ndepending on the nature of farming being undertaken.  Also, the Real estate Developers in \n\nGhana enjoys a tax holiday of five years and Venture Capital firms are encouraged with a \n\ntax holiday of 5 years from paying Corporate Tax.  The above measure is to expand \n\ndevelopment to other areas of the country. The growth in the key sectors may result in \n\nincreased employment and improved standard of living.  \n\nTaxation is used as a tool to reduce the budget deficit and pay lesser amount of \n\ninterest. An effective and efficient tax Administration may result in increase in tax revenue. \n\nThis may have the effect of a reduced budgetary deficit which will lead to the reduction of \n\ngovernment borrowing, amount of interest and increase the public spend in the social \n\nprogram, infrastructure, industrial and SMEs policies etc. \n\nFor efficient tax administration, the tax authority (GRA) has grouped taxpayers into: \n\na) Individuals who pay taxes on their profit or gains, which are called the self-employed \n\ntaxes, (entrepreneurs either registered or not); b) Employees pay taxes on their wages and \n\nsalaries which are referred to as Pay As You Earn (PAYE); c) Corporate Tax is also paid by \n\nregistered legal entities on their profits; d) Partnership is also a legal entity, but tax payment \n\nis not paid in the name of the partnership business but from the individual partner\u2019s share of \n\nprofit. This also the way tax payments are recorded and reported statistically. \n\nGhana\u2019s taxation is backed by laws enacted by parliament, although there is \n\nintegration of all the revenue agencies, the individual laws are still in use for the \n\nadministration and collection of tax revenue now. Internal Revenue Act, 2000 (Act 592) as \n\namended is the law that is used to administer direct taxes in Ghana; the law has three \n\n\n\n \n \n\n53 \n\n \n\ncategories of income on which taxes are levied in Ghana. These categories are i) income \n\nfrom Business; ii) income from an employment; iii) income from an investment.  \n\nSection 7 of the Act defines income from business as: a) a person\u2019s income from a \n\nbusiness,  \n\nas that person\u2019s gains or profits from any business carried on for whatever period of \n\ntime by that person; b) there shall be included in ascertaining the gains or profits from \n\na business carried on by a person amounts accruing to or derived by that person that \n\nare attributable to the business and that would be included in calculating that person\u2019s \n\nincome from any investment \n\nThus, any individual engaged in any business venture must declare his/her income to be \n\ntaxed, which includes entrepreneurs in the urban informal sector. The tax rate differs from \n\nthe type of business, the category (company or self-employed) and either resident or non-\n\nresident.  \n\nSection 8 (1) of the Act defines what the law means by income from employment as \n\n\u201cthat person\u2019s gains or profits from that person\u2019s employment\u201d. Section 8, sub-section 2 \n\nfrom \u201cA-F\u201d state various gains that comes to the hands of a person in employment, yet not \n\ntax as gains or profit to that person. Sub-section 2 state that \u201cthe gains or profit from an \n\nemployment of a person include any allowances or benefits paid in cash or given in kind to, \n\nor on behalf of, that person from that employment\u201d.  The tax on employment is by the use \n\nof the monthly graduated rate after all additions in the form benefits in cash or kind have \n\nbeen made and deductions in the form of personal reliefs have also been considered. \n\nHowever, in the case of an employee whose monthly earning is up to the minimum wage, \n\nthe rate is charge at 0% with those earning is in excess of 5% of the minimum wage, pays a \n\nflat tax of 2.5% on the excess.  \n\nSection 9, sub- sections 1&amp;2 of the Act also define and give meaning to what the \n\nlaw regards as income from investment: \n\n\u201ci) a person\u2019s income from an investment is that person\u2019s gains or profits from any \n\ninvestment\u201d; ii) \u201cthe gains or profits of a person from investment include any dividends \n\nfrom a non-Resident company, interest, charge, annuity, royalties, rent, natural resource \n\npayment, or other income accruing to or derived by that person from the investment other \n\nthan an amount included in ascertaining that person\u2019s income from a business or \n\nemployment\u201d. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n54 \n\n \n\nTax rate on investment incomes is different for all the categories mention in ii) above, for \n\ninstance, rent tax is charge at a rate of 8% of the total rent income and dividends from non-\n\nresident companies are taxed at 10% of the total amount.   \n\nIn Ghana, the following are the important taxes administered by the Ghana Revenue \n\nAuthority (GRA), and these are group under two broad categories which are Domestic and \n\nCustom duties or taxes. The Domestic Taxes are directly under the Domestic Tax Revenue \n\nDivision (DTRD) and the Custom Division is also in charge of the collection of the custom \n\nand excise taxes. \n\n \n\nI) Income Taxes in Ghana \n\nTaxes on income and property in Ghana are generally derived from personal and \n\ncorporate income taxes. The personal income tax is a progressive system that covers \n\nemployees, sole proprietors and partnerships. These taxes are charge on the income of \n\nindividuals and companies. The incidence of the tax is on the individuals or the companies \n\nearning the income. Some of the major taxes are briefly discussed: \n\n \n\nCorporate Tax \n\nThese are taxes paid by companies on their profit in a particular year. The tax is \n\ncharged after all outgoings and expenses that are wholly, exclusively and necessary \n\nincurred in the production of the income are allowed to be deducted. The basis period of a \n\ncompany is the accounting year. However, the tax law allows companies to choose their \n\nown accounting year; the companies can only change with prior approval from the \n\nCommissioner General of the Ghana Revenue Authority. The current general rate for the \n\ncompany (corporate) tax is 25%. This rate is agreed on between the government and the tax \n\nauthority after considering a lot of economic indicators and the performance of the \n\neconomy. It does not have a single base on which the rate is determined.  \n\n \n\nPersonal Income Tax \n\nThese are taxes levied on self-employed persons who are obliged to pay income tax \n\non their profit or earnings at the end of the year after all outgoings and expenses which are \n\nwholly, exclusively and necessary are deducted. The basis period of the individual is the \n\n\n\n \n \n\n55 \n\n \n\naccounting year (1\nst\n January to 31\n\nst\n December). Unlike the company tax, the self-employed \n\nbusinesses, excluding those in the informal sector are taxed using the graduated rate as in \n\nthe table below. \n\nTable 9: Annual Tax Rate for Self-Employed Persons, 2013. \n\n Chargeable income \n\nGH\u00a2 \n\nTax Rate % Tax Charged GH\u00a2 \n\nFirst 1,584.00 Free Nil \n\nNext 792.00 5 39.6 \n\nNext 1,104.00 10 110.40 \n\nNext 28,200.00 17.5 4,935.00 \n\nExceeding 31,680 25  \n\nSource: Ghana Revenue Authority \n\n \n\nIn this table, the chargeable income represents the annual income of a resident self-\n\nemployed (monthly in the case of an employee) at which the tax rate is multiplied with in \n\norder to get the tax for the individual. If that person\u2019s chargeable income does not exceed \n\nGH\u00a21,584.00 (marginal threshold), the rate is free and therefore, no tax is paid. The more \n\nthe chargeable income exceeds the marginal threshold, the higher the rate and the resultant \n\ntax to be paid.  The table 10 below which is for the calculation of monthly employees\u2019 tax \n\nis the same. \n\n \n\nTable 10: Monthly Income Tax Rate for Employees, 2013 \n\n Chargeable income \n\nGH\u00a2 \n\nTax Rate % Tax Charged GH\u00a2 \n\nFirst 132.00 Free Nil \n\nNext 60.00 5 3.30 \n\nNext 92.00 10 9.20 \n\n\n\n \n \n\n56 \n\n \n\nNext 2,350.00 17.5 411.25 \n\nExceeding 2,640.00 25  \n\nSource: Ghana Revenue Authority  \n\n \n\n \n\nPay As You Earn (PAYE) \n\nPAYE is a method of withholding tax that employers withhold from the salaries and \n\nwages of their employees as contribution to the tax revenue of the country. These taxes are \n\ndeducted using the graduated rate (Monthly). The law gives the employers on or before the \n\n15\nth\n\n of the following month after the month of deduction to pay same to the GRA. The table \n\nabove shows how the tax is deducted. Again as a way of lifting some of the social burdens \n\nfrom workers or individuals, Section 39 of the Internal Revenue Act, 2000 (Act, 592) as \n\namended allows for the following personal upfront reliefs to be deducted from the salaries \n\nbefore tax is calculated.  These reliefs are: Old age relief, Aged dependent relief, Child \n\neducation, Marriage/Responsibility and Disability relief. The tripartite committee has also \n\nmade it a point that, employees who earn the monthly minimum wage or below do not pay \n\ntaxes on their wages. With this policy in place, since most of the informal sector workers \n\nearn below the minimum wage, their wages are not taxed \n\n \n\nOther Domestic Taxes \n\nOther taxes that are administered by the DTRD are The Value Added Tax (VAT), \n\nNational Health Insurance Levy (NHIL), and Communication Service Tax (CST).  The \n\nVAT is a form of consumption tax which is imposed on goods and services supplied or \n\nimported into the country. The incidence of the tax is on the consumers when they purchase \n\ngoods or services rendered. Businesses are registered to collect the tax based on their \n\nturnover in the stages of value added, from the manufacturing to the retail stage. The \n\ncurrent VAT rate is 12.5%. A special scheme of collecting the VAT known as the \u201cVAT \n\nFlat Rate Scheme\u201d has been designed for the traders operating in the retail sector. Retail \n\noperators are obliged to charge the VAT at a flat rate of 3% on all taxable goods (VAT, Act \n\n564).   \n\n\n\n \n \n\n57 \n\n \n\nLevy tax is imposed on goods and services at the rate of 2.5%. This levy take the \n\nsame attribute of the Value Added Tax, so in Ghana, both are collected together at a single \n\ntransaction. It was introduced to cushion and help sustain the National Health Insurance \n\nscheme in the country. The tax is imposed on the use of communication services by \n\nconsumers. It is collected by the communication service providers and paid to the GRA at \n\nthe end of every month.  \n\nThe CST was established by an act of parliament, Communication Service Tax, Act \n\n2008 (Act, 754). Section 5 of the act mandates government to use at least 20% of the \n\nrevenues generated to finance the National Youth Employment Programs (CST Act, 754). \n\nOthers include: i) Vehicle income tax, ii) Tax stamp, iii) Stamp Duty, iv) Capital Gains \n\nTax, v) Gift Tax, vi) Rent Tax and vii) Mineral Royalties.  \n\n \n\nII)  Custom Duties \n\nExcise duty is payable on all locally manufactured or produced goods, unless the \n\ngoods are exempt from the duty. The duty is computed on the ex-factory prices of the \n\ngoods produced. The ex-factory price of the product is the factory cost of production plus \n\nthe manufacturer\u2019s profit margin. Currently excise duty is levied on alcoholic and non-\n\nalcoholic beverages as well as tobacco and petroleum products. The commissioner has the \n\nright to exempt some goods from taxed upon application from the manufactures. The duty \n\nis due and shall be paid by the manufacturer to the GRA before the goods are delivered \n\nfrom the factory or the warehouse. Unfortunately, there are no available figures to show the \n\ntotal excise duty contribution to GDP in Ghana, but according to Terpker, 2001, excise duty \n\nincreased from 12.8% in 1993 to 15% of GDP in 1995 after the restructure of the tax in the \n\n1980s (p.3).  \n\nInternational trade tax includes import and export duties on both traditional and \n\nnon-traditional goods. Import duties are payable on almost all import into the country \n\nexcept those with specific exemptions such as agricultural inputs, personal effects, \n\nindustrial machinery, solar cells and panels, thermal energy and electrical generating set of \n\n375 KVA and above, among other goods. Currently the general standard import duty is \n\ncharged at the rate of 20%, but import of raw materials by manufacturing companies pay \n\nthe duty at 10% of the total amount of the import (Abdullah, 2008). Export duty on the \n\n\n\n \n \n\n58 \n\n \n\nother hand, is paid on goods exported from the country. The duty is currently levied on \n\ncocoa beans and Hydrocarbon oil, (e.g. Aviation turbo kerosene). Apart from this two \n\ngoods, all other export are taxed at zero (0) percent (Ghana Revenue Authority web site).  \n\n \n\n3.1 Taxing the Informal Sector \n\nThere have been a lot of difficulties in taxing the informal sector by Tax \n\nAdministrators in many developing countries. A report by Africa Tax Spotlight (ATS), it \n\ncame out with three main benefits for taxing the informal sector, which are for government \n\nto raise enough revenues for the provision of more infrastructures. It will also help to \n\nadvance the growth of the economy and if the informal sector operatives pay taxes, it will \n\nenhance political accountability as well as ensuring greater ways for engaging with the \n\nstate. In many developing countries, taxation has been a burden on the shrinking formal \n\nsector whiles majority of the informal sector entrepreneurs continue to avoid the payment \n\nof income tax. \n\nWedderburn et al. (p.2), in a paper captioned \u201cThe informal economy in Jamaica: Is \n\nIt feasible to tax this sector\u201d also gave out further reasons or benefits in taxing the informal \n\nsector in Jamaica. The benefit to them are that taxing with the appropriate tax system will \n\nimprove tax revenues which can pay off the nation\u2019s debt, economic growth as well as \n\nproviding domestic programs that will go a long way to improve the lives of the citizens. \n\nTaxing the informal sector will also help in revealing the size of the sector that can expose \n\nthe \u201cdeeper, more pervasive issues of corruption and bribery\u201d \n\nThe nonpayment of income tax by the informal sector undermines the linkage \n\nbetween citizens and the state (Green, 2013).  It has been revealed that taxing the informal \n\nsector increases the moral and also increases tax compliance from other sectors of the \n\neconomy (Terpker, 2003, Ayee, 2007, p.2). Torgler 2003 also gives account of the fact that \n\n\u201cevidence from Latin America shows that tax compliance in the formal sector is high in \n\ncountries with small informal sector\u201d (Ayee, 2007, p.2). Therefore, one can strongly \n\nforesee that taxing the informal sector also have positive compliance effects on other \n\nsectors such as the formal sector, thereby improving tax collection in the country as a \n\nwhole.  \n\nAccording to Ayee (2007), taxing the informal sector of Ghana as well as most \n\ndeveloping countries comes with a number of reasons, enumerated as follows: \u201cRevenue \n\n\n\n \n \n\n59 \n\n \n\nneeds, the phenomenal size and growth of informal sector, impact on tax compliance in the \n\nformal sector, State legitimacy, and demands from the informal sector as well as tax-\n\naccountability link\u201d. However, not all informal sector businesses can be taxed. \n\nRecords available from the Bank of Ghana and the Ghana Statistical Service, reveal \n\nthat the self-employed constitute the least taxpayers in the country in spite of it size. These \n\nself-employed businesses are mainly the urban informal sector operatives which constitute \n\nthe largest business in Ghana. Although taxes from the informal sector (Self-employed) is \n\nvery small, the size of the sector and the fact that there are some large operators within the \n\nsector makes it assuring that much tax revenue can be achieved. Ordonez (2010) was able \n\nto estimate that, if the Mexican informal sector is successfully taxed, it can lead to an \n\nincrease of about 17% in total economic productivity.  \n\nThe major obstacle to income tax collection from the informal sector are the size of \n\nthe sector which makes it difficult to be identified for proper tax enforcement and since the \n\nsector is largely self-employed, with cash transactions, there are no proper accounting \n\nrecords that will help authorities to determine their actual incomes to be taxed, thus, making \n\nthe informal sector worst offenders of tax evasion (Terpker, 2013). In the Minister of \n\nFinance\u2019s address to the managements of GRA, he admitted that the informal sector \n\ncontinues to be the \u201cworst offenders of tax evasion in the country\u201d and that the tax \n\nadministrators should put in place measures to curb this situation. This to me makes the \n\nissue of tax evasion by the informal sector important and needs to be addressed by \n\nauthorities immediately.  Otieku (1988) outlines the following as constituting tax evasion: \n\n\u201ca) illiteracy on the part of some informal sector entrepreneurs, b) lack of voluntary \n\ncompliance in the payment of their obligated taxes, c) domination of cash transactions, d) \n\nlow standard of record keeping and e) inaccessibility to tax offices to pay their taxes\u201d.  If \n\nadequate measures are put in place in addressing the issues above by policy makers, \n\ninternal revenue generation can be increased.  \n\n I must acknowledge that it is not all informal sector operatives that have the right \n\ncondition to pay tax, because some engage in informal activities as survival strategies and \n\ntherefore taxing their meager incomes will bring a lot of hardships to them. There is also \n\nthe need for the outlining of advantages or benefits in a form of social policies for the \n\noperators of small businesses and the informal sector as well as coming out with \n\n\n\n \n \n\n60 \n\n \n\nappropriate punitive mechanisms to punish defaulters. These people to me need a lot of \n\ntransfer programs from the state to help them survive and live better. \n\n \n\n3.1.2 Tax Payment and the Contribution of Informal Sector  \n\nTaxpayers in Ghana are segmented according to their annual turnover (Large, \n\nMedium and Small) the following table provides the various turnover thresholds for each of \n\nthe categories. \n\nTable 11: Taxpayer Segmentation- GRA \n\nTAXPAYERS TURNOVER THRESHOLD \n\nLarge GH\u00a25million and above \n\nMedium GH\u00a290,000 and not exceeding \n\nGH5million \n\nSmall Turnover below GH\u00a290,000 \n\nSource: Ghana Revenue Authority. \n\n \n\nThe informal sector is captured as part of the small taxpayers in Ghana. It is not all \n\nsmall businesses that are classified as informal, because there are other small businesses \n\nthat has registered officially or has been formalized and that proportion are taxed using the \n\ngraduated rate. As has been said earlier, the part of informal sector who cannot go through \n\nregistration as well as to pay income taxes are those who sell petty items on tables and the \n\nfloor ranging from food stuffs to very small household items, domestic workers, street \n\nvendors etc. any attempt to tax these people can impose hardship on them and their families \n\nbecause they lack the condition to do so. In that sense Brazil\u2019s tax reforms MEI for small \n\nbusinesses can be considered. Their business activities are for their survival and not to \n\naccumulate profit. There are others who are in the informal sector whose earnings are very \n\nhigh and would have to pay more taxes. Some of this people are, for example, car dealers in \n\nour urban cities, food sellers, and textile sellers in our various market centers in the cities \n\namong others.   \n\n\n\n \n \n\n61 \n\n \n\nAccording to Yeboah 2012, the GRA has come out with the following statistics on \n\nthe percentage size of businesses and their percentage tax contribution as contained in the \n\ntable below. \n\n \n\nTable 12: Business Size and their Tax Contribution in Ghana \n\nBUSINESS PERCENTAGE SIZE PERCENTAGE TAX \n\nCONTRIBUTION \n\nLarge Less than 1% 70% + \n\nMedium 5%-25% 10%-25% \n\nSmall &amp; Micro 70%-95% Less than 10% \n\nSource: Yeboah, 2012 \n\nThe table above shows that the small and micro size businesses that form the \n\ninformal sector are the majority (70-95%) of the firms in the country yet contributes less \n\nthan 10% of tax revenue. Comparing this to the large firms that forms less than 1% yet, \n\ncontribute more than 70% of tax revenue. There is the need for proper segmentation of the \n\nsmall businesses in order to identify the vulnerable groups to be exempted from tax and \n\nadvocate for government to offer them subsidies to let them improve on their livelihood. \n\nThere is also the upper segment of the informal sector or the small businesses that need to \n\nbe taxed more, thereby increasing the tax revenue of the informal sector.  \n\nThe Commissioner General of GRA, Mr. Blankson has said at the 2013 \n\nManagement Retreat that the informal sector contributes 5% of tax revenue in the country. \n\nAccording to him, \u201can estimated 1.5million Ghanaians pay direct taxes only five percent of \n\nthis taxpaying population is in the informal sector\u201d. This trend has been in the system for \n\nquite some time, a former Assistant Commissioner of the erstwhile Internal Revenue \n\nService, Mrs. Amamoo in 2008 also came out with some interesting figures to buttress the \n\npoint that the informal sector contribute very little to the tax revenue of the country. She \n\nsaid, out of the 266,760 self-employed registered by the Ghana Registrar General\u2019s \n\nDepartment, only 53,352 have been registered with the tax authority, this leaves the rest of \n\n\n\n \n \n\n62 \n\n \n\nthe people in the informal sector. It thus calls for reforms to link business registration \n\ntaxpayer registration to capture all businesses.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 1  PERCENTAGE CONTRIBUTION BY TAX TYPE \n\n \n\nSource: Data from GSS and BANK of GHANA. S/E= Self-Employed and TDT= Total Direct Tax \n\n \n\nThe above figure represents the percentage contribution of all tax types in Ghana for \n\n2009 to 2012, September. As we can see whiles the other tax types increase their \n\ncontribution to the direct tax revenue, same cannot be said for the Self-Employed (S/E). For \n\ninstance, in 2009, the S/E contributed 4.24% of tax, this figure reduced in 2010 to 4.08%, \n\nthe 2011 figures up to September recorded 3.55%, comparing the same period in 2012, the \n\ncollection further declined to 2.90% with Personal Income Tax (PAYE) and Companies \n\ncontributing 40.34% and 38.96% respectively, however, they contribute to VAT since that \n\nis a consumption tax. How can country develop meaningfully with a high informal sector \n\nthat contributes very little to the tax wallet of the nation? This figure also shows that \n\nmajority of the direct tax generated in the country comes from workers small salaries. \n\nAlthough there is no empirical evidence, some informal sector operatives earn incomes \n\nwhich are more than an average worker, yet are not paying tax. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n63 \n\n \n\n3.1.3 Systems for Taxing the Informal Sector (Self-Employed) \n\nThe Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) from 1970, adopted several methods of \n\ncollecting taxes from the informal sector, before the coming into force of the Internal \n\nRevenue Act (IRA 592, Act 2000) and Internal Revenue Regulation (IRR, 2001, LI 1675). \n\nThe erstwhile IRS used a general system of presumptive flat tax, as means of taxing the \n\ninformal sector, which ensured that businesses operating within the sector are tax based on \n\nStandard Assessment, which did not take into consideration the incomes earned by the \n\nbusiness, but was based on the size of the business and the industry. This system was first \n\nintroduced in the 1960s with all operators paying a lump sum of money as tax. The \n\nestimated amounts to be paid by the informal sector as tax liability are based on financial \n\nand economic surveys of firms, industries or sectors. Also the system is based on standard \n\nindicators such as sales, purchases, estimated profit margins, floor space and number of \n\nemployees if any. The system brought about a lot of difficulties to both the tax authorities \n\nand the tax-paying community, although it initially brought a lot of gains (Amamoo, 2008). \n\nAccording to Joshi and Ayee (2002), there was an agitation of the system not been fair, due \n\nto the fact that lower and higher income earners were paying the same tax. That the \n\ninformal sector did not comply with the tax they were supposed to pay. This prompted a \n\nneed for reforms that will help the state to find a better way of taxing the sector, the \n\noccupational group tax system adopted. \n\nThe revenue agency as part of addressing the poor implementation of the \n\npresumptive tax system brought about the idea of \u201cagency role\u201d of occupational groups or \n\nassociation. This measure was aim at widening the tax net to increase revenue generation \n\nfrom the informal sector. In 1987, occupational group or identifiable groups were given \n\nagency role by the IRS to collect taxes from their members on behalf of the commissioner \n\nafter negations with their leadership, which was aimed at bringing into the tax net potential \n\ntaxpayers within the various associations or groups. This was accepted because it was very \n\neasy to collect from their members that they already know. The system had gone through a \n\nlot of changes from daily collections initially through weekly collection to quarterly to \n\nreduce the high cost of printing of the receipts and monitoring by tax officials. \n\nAccording to Mrs. Lydia Amamoo (Deputy Commissioner, DTRD),  she revealed \n\nthat \u201calthough the system chalked up some initial success, in the long run, it failed to make \n\n\n\n \n \n\n64 \n\n \n\nthe desired impact on self-employed collection\u201d.  Some of the problems associated with the \n\nfailure of the system were: \n\n1) \u201cFailure to properly account for the taxes collected \n2) Falsification of receipts and other records \n3) Conflict in the associations \n4) Spring up of sprinter-groups in the associations \n5) Linking-up of membership fees and dues to payment of tax \n6) Imposition of unauthorized penalties by the associations for non-payment of the \n\ntaxes \n\n7) Inadequate monitoring by the service\u201d \n \n\nThis called for further reforms that will be appropriate to achieve the objective of \n\nadequately taxing the informal sector. The coming into force of the Internal Revenue Act \n\nand the Internal Revenue Regulations of 2000 and 2001 respectively, brought into effect \n\nregulations 25 of LI 1675 with the list of associations, occupational groups and classes of \n\npersons forming the informal sector in the country for the purposes of taxation and new \n\nways of taxing them.  \n\nThe following were the major reforms adopted to improve the tax revenue \n\ncollection of the informal sector enterprises. The introduction of Vehicle Income Tax (VIT) \n\nis a way of capturing all commercial vehicle owners to pay their taxes on quarterly basis.  \n\nThis law was contained in the legislative instrument (LI. 1727), and schedule five of \n\nregulation 25A. The stickers are purchased from the offices of the IRS (now the STO \n\noffices of the GRA) which are to be conspicuously displayed on the windscreen of the \n\nvehicle; this will enable the police to effectively check defaulters. The stickers can be \n\nbought individually or by the transport unions.\n24\n\n \n\nThe VIT that was introduced assisted in capturing all commercial vehicle owners on \n\nquarterly basis for tax purposes. The LI. 1727 came out with the following important issues \n\nas stated by Mrs. Amamoo (Deputy Commissioner, STO and Field operations): \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                           \n24\n\n This was to encourage the unions and also 2.5% discount is given to them for bulk purchases of the sticker. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n65 \n\n \n\nBox 2: IMPORTANT ISSUES OF LI. 1727 \n\n \n\n1) VIT stickers are mandatory for all commercial road vehicles \n\n2) Stickers are to be displayed on the windscreens of all vehicles like the insurance \n\nand road worthiness Certificates. \n\n3) Specified rates are provided for various classes of commercial vehicle \n\n4) The VIT stickers system shall be enforced by the police and monitored by tax \n\nauthority\u2019s monitoring teams in collaboration with the police \n\n5) Taxpayers are required to file their tax returns at the end of each year since the \n\npayments for the VIT are not final but payment on account. \n\n6) The LI also provided punitive sanctions against those who fail to comply, \n\nranging from a fine of not less than 25 penalty units and not more than 50 \n\npenalty units to imprisonment of not less than two (2) months. \n\nSource: Mrs. Amamoo (Deputy Commissioner, STO and Field operations) \n\nThe rate of tax payable by the commercial vehicle owners are reviewed as and when \n\nnecessary through negotiation between the tax authorities and the transport unions. One can \n\nconfidently say that the introduction of the LI.1727 has improved the tax collection from \n\nself-employed commercial vehicle operators. The current amendment of the regulation in \n\n2011, LI 1997, has new figures as tax to be paid by the owners of these commercial \n\nvehicles as contained in the table below. \n\n \n\nTable 13: Ghana Vehicle Income Tax Rate, 2013 \n\nVehicle \n\nClass \n\n  \n\n Description \n\nAnnual \n\nRate GH\u00a2 \n\nQuarterly \n\nRate GH\u00a2 \n\nA1 Taxis and Private Taxis 48,00 12,00 \n\nA3 Trotro (which carries up to 15 persons) 64,00 16,00 \n\nB1 Hiring Cars (Salon and Caravan) 320,00 80,00 \n\n\n\n \n \n\n66 \n\n \n\nB1 Hiring Cars (4x4) four wheel Drive 480,00 120,00 \n\nB1 Trotro (Which carries up to 19 persons) 80,00 20,00 \n\nB2 Trotro (which carries between 20 and 23persons) 80,00 20,00 \n\nB3 Trotro (which carries between 24 and 34 persons) 120,00 30,00 \n\nC1 Commuter (which carries up to 15 persons) 80,00 20,00 \n\nC2 Commuter (which carries up to 16 and 19 persons) 100,00 25,00 \n\nC3 Commuter-Ford Buses (which carries up to 23 \n\npersons) \n\n90,00 30,00 \n\nC4 Commuter (which carries up to 38 persons) 160,00 40,00 \n\nC4 Tour operators (which carries up to 15 persons) 320,00 80,00 \n\nC5 Tour operator vehicle (which carries between 16 and \n\n23 persons) \n\n400,00 100,00 \n\nC5 Commuter (which carries between 39 and 45 \n\npersons) \n\n200,00 50,00 \n\nC6 Tour Operator vehicle (which carries between 24 \n\nand 38 persons) \n\n280,00 70,00 \n\nC7 Tour operator Bus (which carries above 45 persons ) 600,00 150,00 \n\nC7 Commuter (which carries between 46 and 60 \n\npersons) \n\n240,00 60,00 \n\nD1 Pay loader with capacity to carry dry cargo below \n\n2tons \n\n140,00 35,00 \n\nD2 Motor vehicle which carries dry cargo of between 2 \n\nand 3 tons, tanker with a capacity of not more than \n\n2000 gallons, sewage tankers, garbage trucks and \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n67 \n\n \n\ncranes. 256,00 64,00 \n\nD3 Tankers with capacity of more than 2000 gallons, \n\ngraders and bulldozers \n\n404,00 101,00 \n\nD4 Vehicle with the capacity to carry dry cargo of \n\nbetween 4 to 7 tons \n\n480,00 120,00 \n\nD5 Tipper trucks (single axle) 320,00 80,00 \n\nD6 Tipper trucks (Double axel) 480,00 120,00 \n\nD7 Articulated truck and trailer with capacity of 18 \n\ncubic meters and timber trucks \n\n800,00 200,00 \n\nD8 Tipper trucks (ranging from 12 to 14 wheelers) 600,00 150,00 \n\nD9 Ambulance and motor hearse 88,00 22,00 \n\n \n\nIn 2005, the erstwhile IRS as a way of improving the contribution of tax by the \n\ninformal sector (self-employed) other than the vehicle owners came out with LI. 1803 \n\nregulation 25B captioned \u201cTax installments payable by specified self-employed persons\u201d \n\nwhich introduced a new quarterly tax payment known as the \u201cTax Stamp\u201d system. The \n\nsystem also deals with the identifiable groupings, because of the lack of effective book-\n\nkeeping that would have allowed for proper standard income taxation.

This form of transaction creates avenues for them to cover up their \n\nprofit or incomes that are to be taxed. The following are three major difficulties that prevent \n\nproper taxation of the informal sector: i) capacity constraints; ii) the issue of equity; iii) \n\npolitical issue. \n\nThe informal sector lacks the capacity to keep proper books of account or financial \n\nrecords for tax purposes, making it difficult for tax authorities to effectively assess them to \n\ntax. According to Ayee (2007), he state that \u201c\u2026in tax administration a very important task \n\nis the correct determination of income of the taxpayer so that a meaningful assessment of \n\nthe tax liability could be made\u201d. This constraint can be attributed to the level of illiteracy \n\namong operators in the sector. Tax administrators on the other hand, also lack the capacity \n\nto enforce the laws available to them to collect taxes from the citizenry in general and the \n\ninformal sector in particular. Terpker (2006, p.27), thinks that accounting is necessary for \n\nenhancing tax compliance, meanwhile small businesses finds it difficult and expensive to \n\nmaintain proper or adequate accounting records. In order to solve this problem that will go \n\na long way to put an end to the indiscriminate application of cash accounting and also to \n\nreduce the system of presumptive tax rules applied to all small business, it is important for \n\n\u201cpolicy makers or those in the accounting practice to design a simple cash and accrual \n\naccounting format that comes with less cost that the operatives within the informal sector \n\ncan afford\u201d. \n\nIncome or profit from majority of the informal sector operatives is said to be low \n\nwhich are difficult to tax, some also receive a lot of income or profit that needs to be \n\nassessed for the right tax to be charged. In fact enough tax can be charged from this group \n\nto bring out the progressiveness of the direct tax system. However, the lack of effective \n\nfinancial records by operatives makes it difficult to target the high income earners to pay \n\nmore tax in order to bring equity in the tax system to save the low income earners within \n\nthe sector. The use of presumptive tax system to tax the informal sector, which are \n\nestimates imposed on operatives can be addressed if proper financial records are kept by \n\nbusiness, that would help tax authorities to distinguish between who should pay more tax \n\nand who should not even pay the tax at all.  If accounting record is been kept by all \n\n\n\n \n \n\n70 \n\n \n\noperatives, the presumption tax should be paid by the vulnerable small businesses (Terpker, \n\n2006). \n\nJudith Tendler (2002, p.3), terms the political influence in the taxation of the \n\ninformal sector as the \u201cDevils deal\u201d, which is an unspoken arrangement between politicians \n\nand the informal operatives. Low income taxpayers within the sector are many, yet \n\ncontribute very little to the tax revenue, hence have a strong political voice, Politicians also \n\nhave the strong incentive to exempt them or willing to turn blind eye on the informal sector \n\nin exchange of political support or vote to maintain them in power. As long as the \n\npoliticians depend largely on the vote of the citizenry to keep them in power, they greatly \n\ndo everything humanly possible to attract the vote of the informal sector. \n\nThe informal sector is a very important sector of the economy that needs a lot of \n\nattention from policy makers to ensure that the sector contribute more meaningfully and \n\ncome out with programs to encourage formalization which will reduce the high informality \n\nthe country is experiencing. I believe that for a sector that do not have the capacity to \n\nmaintain accounting records which will enable tax administrators to give them proper \n\nassessment, the Tax Stamp and the Vehicle Income Tax (VIT) systems are the best way of \n\ntaxing the sector. There is the need to separate the informal sector into those who have the \n\nconditions to pay more taxes and those who do not have the material and financial \n\nconditions to pay tax, they are just in the sector for survival and need government support, \n\nputting taxes on their incomes will create a lot of hardship for them. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n71 \n\n \n\n4. FINAL CONSIDERATION \n\n \n\nGhana\u2019s tax system has a lot of difficulties which is affecting revenue mobilization \n\nin the country.  The Ghana Revenue Authority has to improve the tax system in order for \n\nthe citizen to have confidence and contribute significantly in to the tax revenue coffers.  \n\nThe lack of resource in the form of human and logistics is one major constraint that \n\nhas made tax administration very difficult.  For effective and efficient tax administration, \n\nthere is the need for more skilled human resources to be able to ensure proper enforcement \n\nof the tax laws and undertake inspection of taxpayers. Frequent monitoring of taxpayers \n\nrequires a well trained staff. The other issue is the lack of logistics like operational vehicles, \n\noffices, computers and many more.  The tax system in Ghana generally operates with more \n\nmanual and paper work in this era of technological advancement.  \n\nAfter so many years of the existence as administrators of direct tax systems in \n\nGhana, the GRA has still not been able to automate all of its operations and continues to do \n\npaper work. This has also contributed immensely to the poor tax revenue generation as a \n\ncountry. Government needs to change these systems by resourcing the revenue agency to \n\nspeed up the automation of the tax system. The Brazilian case has shown that automation \n\nand cash-less business environment is a sure way of increasing tax revenue. \n\nOne other area that requires a lot of attention is taxpayer education by the revenue \n\nagency. Educating or training of taxpayers on some of the beneficiary provisions in the tax \n\nlaws will encourage them to trust the system for voluntary tax compliance.  Some of the \n\nbenefits are: tax incentives, tax concessions and tax reliefs and also interpretation of certain \n\nunclear portions of the tax laws to them will also go a long way to help. This will give the \n\nGRA the confidence to carry out any action against those who do not comply with tax laws \n\nand their obligation to pay tax. The business environment in Ghana is dominated by cash \n\ntransactions which make it difficult to analyze incomes of many tax payers for fair and \n\nproper assessment; this situation has made the informal sector very hard to tax. This is an \n\narea that needs to be looked at seriously by the tax authorities; a simple training on income \n\nand expenditure can be given to the small business owners who cannot afford the high cost \n\nof engaging a professional accountant to help them to prepare simple financial records and \n\naccount for tax purposes. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n72 \n\n \n\nThe reforms that are being implemented for informal sector enterprises and SMEs, \n\ncan be considered the best within the circumstances we find ourselves in, especially the \n\nVehicle income Tax and the Tax stamps, since majority of the operatives in the sector are \n\nilliterate or semi-illiterate and cannot keep accounting records on their business for tax \n\ncollectors to properly assess them base on their incomes. What is therefore, required is a \n\nfurther segmentation of the turnover threshold for small businesses in order to identify \n\nthose within the informal sector who earn more incomes and need to be taxed properly to \n\npay more, those who can continue to pay the tax stamps and those whose businesses are on \n\nsurvival bases and do not have the condition to pay income taxes, but rather to receive \n\ngovernment support in a form of cash transfers. \n\nThe Act 592 of 2000 as amended was intended to bring about reforms to all aspects \n\nof the tax system in the country, but it seems the act is in favour of medium and large firms \n\nwith very little mention of small, micro and informal sector businesses. Much needs to be \n\ndone in the area of making tax reforms that will go a long way to encourage small \n\nbusinesses and the informal sector to think of moves to formalize which has the tendency of \n\nimproving tax payment from the sector. The Brazilian experience, where tax payment for \n\nsmall businesses goes with some social benefits can be considered. \n\nThe informal sector in Ghana continues to grow but statistical data and information \n\non the sector is limited, especially in the area of assessing the actual size of the sector. The \n\nsector\u2019s contribution to GDP and the actual contribution to tax revenue have not being \n\nadequately researched on to mention a few. Government should resource the Ghana \n\nStatistical Service and the Ghana Revenue Authority adequately to conduct in-depth \n\nresearch into the informal sector and it contribution to the GDP of this country. This will \n\nhelp tax administrators to come out with tax structure that will have greater consideration of \n\nsmall businesses and the informal sector. No meaningful reform can be done for small \n\nbusinesses and the informal sector, without a proper research of the sectors involved. \n\nSimplification of the tax system is very important, there seems to be a lot of \n\nburdensome procedures in the system that authorities need to work on. Section 72 of the \n\nIRA, 2000 (Act 592 as amended) enjoins \u201ca person to furnish a return of income for the \n\nyear of assessment of that person, not later than four months after the end of a basis period \n\nof that persons ending within the year\u201d. Due to the voluminous nature of the forms, \n\ntaxpayers always find it difficult in completing the forms which cannot also be accessed, \n\n\n\n \n \n\n73 \n\n \n\ncomplete and submitted electronically. Taxpayers find it problematic to travel to the tax \n\noffices to complete this forms. Taxpayers are expected to always walk to the tax offices \n\nbefore they can even make payments. Policy makers must take steps to address this issue \n\nby, simplifying the processes and procedures for easy compliance, such as the return forms \n\nand also to provide the platform for electronic filing of the income tax returns and \n\npayments of taxes by the taxpaying population which will go a long way to help both the \n\ntax authorities and the taxpayers. \n\nRegistration of business in Ghana is a very important tool in the issue of \n\nformalization that has the potential of tax revenue generation. There are cumbersome and \n\nbureaucratic procedures business owners have to go through to register; the cost associated \n\nwith this business registration is also a problem. This also makes it difficult for small and \n\ninformal businesses to convert to formal businesses. According to the World Bank data on \n\n\u201cDoing Business\u201d, Ghana is ranked 111 out of 189 countries in the area of starting a \n\nbusiness in 2013. In 2014, on the same category, Ghana was ranked 128 out of 189 \n\ncountries. This record is very much discouraging and urgent steps are needed to address the \n\nissue which has the potential of reducing informality in the country.  \n\n  In 2002, the parliament of Ghana through the TIN Act, 632 brought into force  \u201cAn \n\nact to establish a Taxpayer Identification Numbering (TIN) system under which taxpayers are given \n\nidentification numbers for official transactions with the public institutions by or under the Act and \n\nto connected matters\u201d. \n\n If this act is well followed, it would give the GRA an opportunity to capture all taxpayers \n\nincluding the informal sector operatives who escape from paying tax, because this numbers \n\nare unique to all persons. Section 5(1) of the act state that: \u201cevery person, liable to pay tax \n\nor required to withhold tax at source\u201d by law is supposed to obtain Tax Identification \n\nNumber (TIN). I therefore, believe that a nationwide issuance of the TIN and also properly \n\nlinking it to some sectors of the economy especially the Driver and Vehicle Licensing \n\nAuthority, would help us to identify and bring into the tax net all taxable persons including \n\nour high informal entrepreneurs.  \n\nLast but not the least, Ghana after fifty-seven (57) years of our independence cannot \n\nboost of a well street-naming system that would make it easier to locate persons, especially \n\ntaxpayers within the informal sector. This failure is blamed on the Metropolitan, Municipal \n\n\n\n \n \n\n74 \n\n \n\nand District Assemblies (MMDAs) on their inability to effectively provide layout and \n\npermit for buildings and house numbering (GoG, 2010). If the guidelines which was \n\ncompiled by the Ministry of local Government and Rural Development, on street naming \n\nand property numbering system (street addressing system) could be followed, this would \n\nlead to roping into the tax net many persons who are doing business of which taxes need to \n\nbe paid on their incomes, but yet cannot easily be traced or located. Many of our informal \n\nsector enterprises fall into this category of persons. This system in my opinion will have \n\npositive impact and also improve the \u201cRent Tax\u201d collection, because of ease in locating \n\nproperties.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n75 \n\n \n\nBIBLIOGRAPHIC REFERENCES \n\n \n\nABDALLAH, Ali-Nakyea (2008), \u201cTaxation in Ghana, Principle, Practice and Planning\u201d \n\nSecond Edition. \n\nABDU Muwonge, Dr. Morios Obwona and Victoria Nambroaay, Enhancing Contributions \n\nof the Informal Sector to National Development; the case of Uganda, Occasional \n\nPaper No. 33, 2007. \n\nADU-AMANKWAH, K (1999), \u201cTrade Unions in the Informal Sector; finding their \n\nBearings\u201d, nine country papers.
