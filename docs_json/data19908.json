The\u00a0stone \nwas recovered in the S\u00e3o Pedro gold mining, in Machado \nor Pinheiro stream, near the current town of Diamantina. \nThe\u00a0chronology of the discoveries in other regions of Minas \nGerais or the colony is not clear. In\u00a0many cases, diamonds \nappeared on the same occasion in different places of Minas \nGerais or even in other areas of the country. Between 1764 \nand 1781,\u00a0diamonds were recovered in the regions of Abaet\u00e9 \nand Itacambiru\u00e7u Valley, in Gr\u00e3o Mongol. In\u00a0the nineteenth \ncentury, especially between 1830 and 1840, diamond depos?\nits were explored in Chapada Diamantina, Bahia. The\u00a0region \nbecame famous for the production of carbonados, which are \nporous aggregates of gray or black micro diamonds. The\u00a0car?\nbonado S\u00e9rgio, weighing 3,167\u00a0carats, was found in Len\u00e7\u00f3is \nin 1895 (Franco 1981; Barbosa 1991). Still in the nineteenth \ncentury, deposits were discovered in the Bagagem River, west \nof Coromandel. It\u00a0was in the alluvial deposits of this river that \nthe 261.88?carat South Star diamond was\u00a0found in 1853, and \nthe 119.5?carat Dresden diamond was found\u00a0four years later \n(Franco 1981; Machado &amp; Figuer\u00f4a 1999). Between 1937 \nand 1943, diamonds over 200\u00a0carats were recovered to the \neast and southeast of Coromandel, more precisely in the allu?\nvial deposits of the Santo Ant\u00f4nio do Bonito, Santo In\u00e1cio \nand Douradinho rivers, including the 726?carat Presidente \nVargas, considered the largest one discovered in Brazil (Fig.\u00a01) \n(Franco 1981; Barbosa 1991; Machado &amp; Figuer\u00f4a 1999).\n\nMost of the diamonds produced in the San Francisco \nCraton are probably from valley alluvium and terraces asso?\nciated with the current drainage. Small productions were or \nare coming from the Mesoproterozoic conglomerates of the \nSopa?Brumadinho Formation, in the Diamantina region, \nand from the Cretaceous conglomerates in Romaria. In\u00a0the \nlatter, the contribution of kimberlitic material such as rock \nfragments, minerals, and diamond is such that the diamond \nrecovery is considered to be characteristic of kimberlite. \nIn\u00a0the Chapada Diamantina region, the diamonds recov?\nered in the alluviums are directly associated with the erosion \nof the diamond?bearing conglomerates of the Tombador \nand Morro do Chap\u00e9u Formations, similarly to that of the \nSalobro Formation of the Rio Pardo Group, located about \n50\u00a0km west of Canavieiras, South Bahia (Pereira 2007).\n\nAlthough without economic potential, other dia?\nmond?bearing units in the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton \nare the Carboniferous Santa F\u00e9 Formation (Campos \n1992),\u00a0the\u00a0Neoproterozoic Jequita\u00ed and Sambur\u00e1 Formations \nand parts of the Neoproterozoic Ibi\u00e1 (Gonzaga et\u00a0al. 1994) \nand\u00a0Maca\u00fabas (Karfunkel et\u00a0al. 2001) groups.\n\nKimberlite occurs in the northern and southern portions \nof the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton (Fig.\u00a02) (Pereira 2007). In\u00a0the \nnorthern portion, the intrusions are located in the Serrinha \nand Gavi\u00e3o blocks. The\u00a0Bra\u00fana 03 kimberlite, classified as \ndiopside?phlogopite kimberlite and located in the Bra\u00fana \nprovince, in the central Serrinha block, has been dated at \n682\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020\u00a0Ma (Rb?Sr on phlogopite). In\u00a0the Gavi\u00e3o block, the \nkimberlites are located near Barra do Mendes, close to the area \nof influence of the extensive Barra do Mendes?Jo\u00e3o Correa \nlineament that divides the Chapada Diamantina into east \nand west structural domains. The\u00a0Rb?Sr dating on phlogopite \nof the Salvador 01 kimberlite provided an age of 1,152\u00a0Ma \n(Williamson &amp; Pereira 1991; Pereira &amp; Fuck 2005). Although \nsub?economic, the Salvador 01 kimberlite contains diamond. \nRecent evaluations of the Bra\u00fana 03 kimberlite indicate mine \nopening in this body (Donatti Filho et\u00a0al. 2013a, b).\n\nUnlike the Proterozoic kimberlites from the northern \nportion of the craton with predominant kimberlites over \nrelated rocks, the intrusions of the southern portion show \nEarly and Late Cretaceous ages with widely predominant \nkamafugites over kimberlites.\n\nChemical analyses of kimberlite minerals recovered from \nalluvial sampling in the areas affected by Cretaceous magma?\ntism in the southwestern portion of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton, \ncovering parts of Minas Gerais, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Goi\u00e1s, allow \ndelimiting peridotitic garnet windows, mainly of G9 lher?\nzolitic?type, the pressure values of which, at the time of crystal?\nlization, are compatible with those of the diamond formation \nstability field, recorded in thick lithosphere.

Comparison of garnet \npressure values with data of clinopyroxene recovered from the \nkimberlite clusters indicate geothermal gradients of approx?\nimately 37\u201343\u00a0mW/m2 for SCL6 and DDO4 kimberlites \n(Pereira 2007). The high temperatures recorded in clinopy?\nroxene reflect probably local little depleted lherzolitic mantle, \nsuggesting that, aside of Mesozoic mantle fertilization, the \npossibility of little depleted mantle should also be consid?\nered in the region. According to Gurney (1984), just 15% of \n\nperidotitic garnet inclusions in diamond correlate with lher?\nzolitic garnet (or G9), whereas in global scale 85% of peri?\ndotitic garnet inclusions are of Ca?poor, Cr?rich harzburgitic \n(G10) type. Also, studies on the origin of diamonds recovered \nin mineral exploration campaigns or acquired in the differ?\nent diggings show different characteristics. Some populations \nindicate YPP sources (Robinson 1991; Robinson et\u00a0al. 1995; \nPereira 2007). In\u00a0the specific case of the alluvial diamond batch \nrecovered in the Santo Ant\u00f4nio do Bonito, Santo In\u00e1cio, and \nDouradinho rivers, about 90% of the stones display no signs \nof transport, which together with the 12\u00a0diamonds present?\ning fragile or twinned forms suggest local primary sources.\n\n385\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 47(3): 383-401, September 2017\n\nRog\u00e9rio Silvestre Pereira et al.\n\n\n\nThe objective of this work was to point out and address \ndetails observed in the studied region in Minas Gerais, to \nsuggest local/proximal sources for the unique diamond pop?\nulation found in the alluvial deposits of the Santo Ant\u00f4nio \ndo Bonito, Santo In\u00e1cio and Douradinho rivers.\n\nGEOLOGICAL AND \nSTRUCTURAL SETTING\n\nThe evolution of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton is marked \nby Paleoproterozoic orogeny, responsible for the amalgam \nand deformation of different Archaean blocks (Barbosa &amp; \nSabat\u00e9 2002, 2004; Alkmim &amp; Teixeira 2017; Teixeira et\u00a0al. \n2017). The\u00a0relatively stable geotectonic unit, comprising \nPaleoproterozoic and Archaean terrains, was partially reworked \nduring the Brasiliano Orogeny in the Neoproterozoic. \nPolyphasic histories of the terrains are common in the north?\nern and southern portions of the craton (Pereira 2007).\n\nThe crystallization and preservation of diamonds until their \ncapture by kimberlite and/or lamproite require the presence of \na thick, relatively cold, refractory, low?density peridotitic root \nisolated from heating and tectonic reworking (Haggerty\u00a01986). \nThese requirements are found in most Archaean terrains little \naffected by processes such as plumes, volcanism recurrence in \nextensional regimes, and collisions that destroy the favorable \nmantle regions under the Archaean?Paleoproterozoic cratons. \nThe\u00a0identification of such terrains is important in the explo?\nration of diamond?bearing kimberlite.\n\nAlthough it is not possible to establish a precise and \ncontinuous boundary between the reworked and preserved \nArchaean terrains in the southern portion of the S\u00e3o Francisco \nCraton, certain evidence allows to point out the least affected \ncore during the Neoproterozoic Orogeny. This portion of the \ncraton is characterized by the presence of Archaean terrains \nconsisting of partially migmatized orthogneiss and sequences \nof volcano?sedimentary rocks developed between 3,200 and \n2,700\u00a0Ma. Apparently, between 2,160 and 2,000\u00a0Ma, the \nedges of this set of rocks were partially reworked and incor?\nporated in the Mineiro Belt, developed into an arch?shaped \nbelt around the Archaean core (Alkmim &amp; Marshak 1998) \n(Fig.\u00a03). Numerous intrusions related to the evolution of \nthe Mineiro Belt aged between 2,200 and 2,000\u00a0Ma and \noccur along the belt. It\u00a0appears that the reworking inflects \nnorthward, under the Bambu\u00ed Basin to the Janu\u00e1ria region, \nwhere the gneiss outcrop is aged 2,710\u00a0\u00b1 7\u00a0Ma, and non?de?\nformed granite dated at 2,163\u00a0\u00b1 13\u00a0Ma (Pereira 2007) is \nexposed. Paleoproterozoic ages are also recorded further north, \nin Correntina and S\u00e3o Domingos (Rendon &amp; Kuyunjian \n2005). Therefore, the data suggest a basement composed of \nPaleoproterozoic?Archean terrains in the western portion \n\nof\u00a0the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton, under the rocks of the Bambu\u00ed \nBasin. The\u00a0craton boundary to the west corresponds to exten?\nsive thrust faults marking the transition between the fold? \nand thrust belt involving basement and the sub?horizontal \ncovers inside the craton during the Brasiliano Orogeny in \nthe Neoproterozoic, when the closure of the basins gener?\nated the marginal Bras\u00edlia Belt (Dardenne 2000; Fuck et\u00a0al. \n2017). Seer et\u00a0al. (2001, 2005) stated that the Arax\u00e1, Ibi\u00e1 \nand Canastra groups, belonging to the southern sector of \nthe Bras\u00edlia Belt (Fuck 1994; Fuck et\u00a0al. 2017) represent dis?\ntinct tectonostratigraphic terrains, with no apparent genetic \nlink, originated by tectonic transport of different geographic \nregions. The\u00a0same authors classified these groups as tectonic \nslices formed of three types of terrain: \n1. Canastra terrain ? fragments of passive continental \n\nmargin; \n2. Ibi\u00e1 terrain ? fragments of a sedimentary portion of the \n\nvolcanic arc; \n3. Arax\u00e1 terrain ? fragments of oceanic crust intruded by \n\ncollisional granites\u00a0(Fig.\u00a03). \n\nApparently, the tectonic sheets formed of these terrains \nand thrown from west to east against the edge of the cra?\nton during the Brasiliano compression did not affect the \nPaleoproterozoic?Archean basement of the S\u00e3o Francisco \nCraton, except, perhaps, in the Arax\u00e1 terrain, where crustal \nmelting took place. This inference is supported by the occur?\nrence of diamond?bearing intrusions in the region.\n\nThe extensive magmatism associated with the develop?\nment of the Alto Parana\u00edba structural high occurs along the \nBras\u00edlia Belt, from the Catal\u00e3o region to the Passos Nappe or \nthe southern end of the Bambu\u00ed Basin (Fig.\u00a03) (Pereira 2007).\n\nOBSERVATIONS ON THE \nALTO PARANA\u00cdBA, ASSOCIATED \nMAGMATISM, AND DIAMONDS\n\nThe Alto Parana\u00edba structural high, developed during \nthe Mesozoic, divides the Paran\u00e1 basin to the west and \nSanfranciscana basin to the east. The\u00a0main divide extends \nalong the Bras\u00edlia Belt; the northwest end borders Catal\u00e3o \nwhile the southeast portion borders the vicinity of the Serra \nNegra intrusion. The\u00a0extension caused by the arching probably \nmoved the Brasiliano thrust/reverse faults along their planes, \ncreating zones of magmatic permeability. Kimberlite\u00a0and \nlamproite are usually located in such areas, characterized by \nsuccessive intrusions of igneous rocks (Kaminsky et\u00a0al.\u00a01995). \nIn\u00a0certain cases, high permeability zones of the crust cor?\nrespond to elongated areas, where horst? and graben?type \nstructures show evidence of the extensional regime.\n\n386\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 47(3): 383-401, September 2017\n\nEvidence of YPP diamond source in Coromandel, MG\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

In\u00a0the Alto Parana\u00edba \nregion, the contrasting quality of the mantle sampled by \nkimberlite, aged between 120 and 90\u00a0Ma, compared to the \nLate Cretaceous kamafugites, aged between 85 and 75\u00a0Ma, \nindicates heating and thinning of the lithosphere in the area \naffected by the structural high. Pressure?temperature (P?T) \nresults obtained on kimberlite?extracted clinopyroxene recov?\nered at the headwaters of the Abaet\u00e9, S\u00e3o Bento, and Indai\u00e1 \nrivers, near Carmo do Parana\u00edba and Lagoa Formosa, and in \nthe Coromandel region, indicate sampling in mantle regions \nbetween 700 and 950\u00b0C, while kamafugite?source clinopy?\nroxene shows temperatures of 800 and 1,200\u00b0C, substantially \nwarmer than that recorded by recovered kimberlite?clinopy?\nroxene. Therefore, in the approximate 5\u00a0Ma range, between \n\n90 and 85\u00a0Ma, about 250\u00b0C heating is observed in these \nregions (Read et\u00a0al. 2003) (Figs.\u00a04 and\u00a05). Thus, comparisons \nof the mantle conditions obtained in successive kimberlite \ngenerations allow monitoring the evolution of the lithosphere \nand the diamond potential of a certain region (O\u2019Reilly &amp; \nGriffin\u00a01996). According to Helmstaedt and Gurney (1994), \ninformation on lithospheric mantle conditions is also obtained \nby diamond abundance, garnet with high Cr2O3 and low \nCaO, and high Cr spinel (Cr> \u00a060%\u00a0wt%) recovered in \nthe intrusions. As\u00a0mentioned before, local little depleted \nlherzolitic mantle in the region should not be discarded. \nThe\u00a0presence of such a mantle would explain the abundant \ndissemination of lherzolitic garnet in the Coromandel area.\n\nThe thinning of the lithosphere and consequent alteration \nof the diamond stability field due to temperature increase \nbetween the Early and Late Cretaceous in Alto Parana\u00edba is \nevident when the analysis results of minerals from kimberlites \nare also compared to the Late Cretaceous rocks intruded into \nstable Archaean terrains, where the underlying lithosphere is \npreserved. This is observed, for example, in the same southern \nportion of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton, where the garnet forma?\ntion pressure increases as the kimberlite intrusions move from \nreworked terrain to a preserved Archaean area, as shown by \nthe red arrow in Figure\u00a03. Even\u00a0inside the Archean terrain, \n\n387\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 47(3): 383-401, September 2017\n\nRog\u00e9rio Silvestre Pereira et al.\n\n\n\nmantle quality varies visibly as intrusions are placed more \nand more in the center of the preserved core. For example, \nanalyses of Junco 01 kimberlite from Junco Province, aged \n82\u00a0\u00b1 5\u00a0Ma (U?Pb in zircon), show 5% spinel of high inter?\nest, 0.5% of subcalcic garnet and is negative for diamond, \nwhile the Maravilhas 03 kimberlite from the Maravilhas \nProvince, aged 81\u00a0\u00b1 2\u00a0Ma (Ar?Ar in garnet), indicates 30% \nspinel with high chromium, 6.3% of subcalcic garnet and a \ndiamond content of 13.48 ct/100\u00a0t (Pereira 2007).\n\nMineral exploration programs in the Alto Parana\u00edba region \nidentified primary sources of diamond?bearing alluvium, \nexplored for years as digging areas. This fact is verified, for \nexample, in the Vargem Bonita diggings in the high course \nof the S\u00e3o Francisco River, where alluvial sampling in the \nriverbed and different terraces along the diggings provided \nkimberlite minerals showing practically no signs of transport, \n\nand diamond with proximal source characteristics. Batches\u00a0of \ndiamonds recovered from alluvium and terraces along the \ndiggings in material that originated from the Canastra \n01\u00a0kimberlite, located near the upstream Cachoeirinha \nstream tributary, show octahedron and dodecahedron?shaped \ncrystallization and stone corrosion characteristics common \nto the two environments (Pereira 2007). The\u00a0digging areas \nof Vargem Bonita stretch for about 35\u00a0km along the S\u00e3o \nFrancisco River, starting from the Casca D\u2019Antas waterfall. \nIt\u00a0is estimated that 500,000\u00a0carats were produced between \nthe 1930s and ~2000. Preliminary data indicate an intrusion \narea of 1.9\u00a0hectares, while significant grades are restricted \nto 0.9\u00a0hectare. Evaluations indicated about 40\u00a0cts/100\u00a0t \nvalued at US$\u00a0150/ct.

The\u00a0dia?\nmonds recovered from kimberlite are dominantly dodecahedral \nand octahedral colored stones, very similar to those recovered \nin the digging. Cubic diamonds represent 10% of the popu?\nlation recovered in TRS\u00a0101, and 4% in TRS\u00a0102 intrusions. \nThese kimberlites are considered the primary sources of the \ndiamond diggings in the S\u00e3o Miguel River (Skinner 1996) \nand are, currently, being economically evaluated.\n\nThe diamond?bearing Tr\u00eas Ranchos 04 kimberlite (Fig.\u00a08), \naged 95\u00a0Ma, consists of a small intrusion, considered as one \nof the oldest discoveries in the region. Processing of 296\u00a0m3 \nof rock material provided 371\u00a0diamonds. About\u00a050% of the \nstones are described as gray and black in color and 30% as \nlighter?colored cubes, typical samples of mantle regions at the \nlimit of the diamond stability field, around 44\u00a0kb pressure \nand about 1,000\u00b0C temperature. Analyses of recovered garnets \nindicate pressure values of at least 51\u00a0kbar (Pereira 2007).\n\nIn 1868, a diamond discovery on the banks of a small \naffluent stream of the Bagagem River gave origin to the mine \nand the village known as \u00c1gua Suja, currently, the town of \n\nRomaria. The\u00a0discovery site and the small stream are pres?\nently within the Romaria urban site (Fig.\u00a03).\n\nSvisero et\u00a0al. (1981) and Fleischer (1998) described the \ngeological features in the area around the mine. The\u00a0authors \nrefer that diamonds occur in a polymictic conglomer?\nate containing blocks up to 80\u00a0cm in diameter and little \nrounded pebbles of micaschist, phyllite, quartzite, metaba?\nsite, Botucatu sandstone and basalt. Locally, the Tau\u00e1 con?\nglomerate is deposited on the aeolian Botucatu sandstone, \nwhich, in turn, covers discordantly the underlying Arax\u00e1 \nGroup micaschists and intrusive granites that serve as base?\nment in the area (Fig.\u00a09). The\u00a0Tau\u00e1 conglomerate is cov?\nered by another polymictic conglomerate called Secondina, \nwhich contains less diamond, smaller pebbles and has max?\nimum thickness of 3 m, and which is probably the result of \nerosion of the Tau\u00e1 conglomerate and subsequent deposi?\ntion. The\u00a0conglomerates are covered with a homogeneous \nsuccession composed of fine? and coarse?grained greenish \nsandstones, associated in this region of Minas Gerais with \nLate Cretaceous volcanic activity.

The\u00a0good \nlocal exposure shows that the basal portion is composed of \nmicaschist containing staurolite, garnet, rutile, tourmaline, \ncut in all directions by pegmatite veins and intrusions of \nmafic rock metamorphosed to amphibolite. According to \nDraper (1911), the conglomerate or breccia, with a maxi?\nmum thickness of 13\u00a0m, rests discordantly on the basement \nand local intrusions, as well as on the sandstone. The\u00a0unit is \nformed of angular or little?rounded fragments of basic igne?\nous rock, granite, quartz, shale, and sandstone, cemented by \nred clay. Layers and masses of opal are observed in the con?\nglomerate. Diamond, pyrope, perovskite, magnetite, ilmen?\nite, and olivine occur in the clayey material that cement the \nfragments. According to the author, the conglomerate layer \nor breccia, as well as the minerals present, is of local origin.\n\nCurrently, the GAR Minera\u00e7\u00e3o company investigates the \narea of the former \u00c1gua Suja mine. With the geologist and \ncompany director, Juliano Magalh\u00e3es Macedo, we examined \ndrill core samples and visited work fronts, where material is \nextracted for processing and diamond recovery. The\u00a0high \ncontribution of kimberlite fragments is noted in the material \nand, according to Juliano Macedo, thin layers, which are char?\nacteristic structures of epiclastic kimberlite, are observed in \ncertain work fronts. The\u00a0drill core samples represent a typical \nbreccia in which kimberlite fragments examined under mag?\nnifying glass show abundant ilmenite and/or spinel (Fig.\u00a010).\n\nBased on the treatment plant recovery, Svisero and \nMeyer (1989) reported that the diamond content in the con?\nglomerate ranged between 0.04 and 0.12\u00a0ct/m3. A\u00a0studied \n\nbatch of 5,317\u00a0stones weighed 450\u00a0carats, corresponding to \n0.084?carat average weight. The\u00a0dominant shape is rhom?\nbododecahedron, followed by cube, octahedron and octa?\nhedron?rhombododecahedron combination. In\u00a0Romaria, \nDe\u00a0Beers purchased a batch of 39 diamonds that weighed \n3,508\u00a0carats, a 0.09?carat average weight. The\u00a0diamonds were \ndominantly rounded dodecahedron and octahedron, while \ncube?shaped stones were between 10 and 15% (Robinson \n1991; Robinson et\u00a0al. 1995). According to the authors, the \nbatch can be described as a mixture composed of cubic and \ndodecahedral stones of gray color, similar to the population \nfrom Tr\u00eas Ranchos 04 kimberlite and a distinct population, \ncomprising mainly rounded dodecahedra. Abrasion is not \nevident, which could suggest either distal sources of dia?\nmonds transported under low energy systems (Robinson \n1991) or, as indicated by other evidence, a YPP source of \ndiamonds. Systematic sampling and concentrates analyzed \nin Romaria digging areas indicated garnet with pressure val?\nues of about 48\u00a0kbar and spinel grains typical of inclusions \nin diamonds (Fig.\u00a011) (Pereira 2007).\n\nThe identification of diamond?bearing kimberlite in dif?\nferent areas of Alto Parana\u00edba makes it clear that kimber?\nlite intrusions, especially of the Early Cretaceous, sampled \nmantle regions favorable to the crystallization and preser?\nvation of diamond.\n\nThe Tr\u00eas Ranchos 04, Tr\u00eas Ranchos 101, 102, 104\u00a0kim?\nberlites and the primary source of \u00c1gua Suja diamond in \nRomaria, responsible for the cubic diamond populations in \nthe region, intruded into the Arax\u00e1 Group terrain, where \nNeoproterozoic intrusions of collisional granites indicate \ncrustal melting. This fact may be an indication that the \nPaleoproterozoic?Archaean lithosphere has undergone some \nalteration at the western edge of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton, \nfavoring crystallization of cubic diamond (Pereira 2007).\n\nFigure 9.

The\u00a0sedimentary?magmatic \nsequence occurring along the Bras\u00edlia Belt and the edges \nof the Paran\u00e1 and Sanfranciscana basins is, to some extent, \nlimited by the development of the extensional regime, where \nhorst and graben are characteristic structures in the evolu?\ntion of linear structural highs.\n\nThe basal conglomerate of the Capacete Formation (Sgarbi \net\u00a0al. 2001), or Tau\u00e1 as it is known in Romaria, is widespread \nin the Alto Parana\u00edba. The\u00a0deposition occurred on a rug?\nged relief, where paleo channels and lowered blocks along \nnormal faults are recorded in the Arax\u00e1 Group micaschist \nand/ or in the Botucatu sandstone that discordantly cov?\ners the Proterozoic rocks of this group in Romaria (Fig.\u00a09). \n\nExposures along the work fronts during diamond explo?\nration in the old \u00c1gua Suja mine allowed Draper (1911) \nand Svisero et\u00a0al. (1981) to observe rocks and their contact \nrelationships in loco. Thus, Draper (1911) concluded that \nthe conglomerate or breccia layer, and the minerals present \n\nare of local origin. The\u00a0author enumerates some facts for \nthis assertion: \n\n ? The Tau\u00e1 conglomerate, local name for the conglomer?\nate, is composed of rocks found in situ, underlying por?\ntions of the conglomerate layer itself.\n\n ? Fragments of the rocks that make up the conglomerate \nare angular, indicating little transport. \n\n ? Occurrence of conglomerate blocks within the Botucatu \nsandstone, whose deposition extended from the \nTriassic?Jurassic to the beginning of the Cretaceous, \nshowing the contemporaneity of the two units in the \nfinal deposition phase of the Botucatu sandstone. \n\n ? The deep weathering observed in every Tau\u00e1 layer can?\nnot be attributed to the infiltration of surface water. \nBesides\u00a0the intense decomposition of the layer, the igne?\nous rocks of the local basement are also totally altered. \n\nThe age of the intrusion could not be determined because \nthe kimberlite conduit was not found; however, intrusions \nin the local stratigraphy indicate an Early Cretaceous age \nfor the hidden body.\n\nOn eastern Alto Parana\u00edba, the western border of the \nSanfranciscana Basin, the crater facies of the X?270 kim?\nberlite, dated at 89.5\u00a0\u00b1 3.4\u00a0Ma, shows sandstone clasts, \nand quartz and feldspar grains, confirming the presence \nof semi?consolidated sediments from the Early Cretaceous \nAreado Group (Fig.\u00a04) (Read et\u00a0al. 2003).\n\nFigure 11. Analyses of heavy mineral concentrates recovered from conglomerates and digging areas in Romaria: \n(A) garnet, (B) spinel (Pereira 2007).

The\u00a0larger or smaller presence of quartzite, \nsandstone and siltstone pebbles and other Proterozoic rocks \nvary according to the bedrock or rocks of the Arax\u00e1, Ibi\u00e1 and \nCanastra groups underlying the conglomerate. Angular peb?\nbles and/or fragments of volcanic rocks, as well as kimberlite \nminerals, bordered by alteration or with a keliphitic corona, \ncharacteristic of little transport, are frequently found in out?\ncrops close to intrusions inferred beneath the conglomerate.\n\nThe old digging known as Canastrel, between the Santo \nAnt\u00f4nio do Bonito and Santo In\u00e1cio rivers, was developed \ndirectly on the conglomerate. The\u00a0exposed outcrop shows at least \na 3?m?thick alternation between tuff and conglomerate mate?\nrial. In some cases, the conglomerate grades to coarse?grained, \ncommonly cross?laminated sandstone. Clasts\u00a0of volcanic and \nProterozoic rocks, about 20 cm in diameter, are present in the \nconglomerate layer. As\u00a0in other outcrops, the top of the suc?\ncession is covered by thick lateritic material. The\u00a0brown matrix \nof the conglomerate bears altered feldspar and phlogopite \n(Karfunkel et\u00a0al. 2014). Garnet\u00a0and ilmenite mantled above \n50% by alteration material are recovered in the soil along the \noutcrop, meaning practically no transport. The\u00a0clasts observed \nin the conglomerate diggings and in other exposures in the \nregion do not show any sorting as to pebble size increase from \nthe top to the base next to the bedrock (Fig.\u00a012). According \nto Karfunkel et\u00a0al. (2014), the last owner recovered 3\u00a0stones \nin the digging, weighing about 2\u00a0carats. Analyses of two of the \n\nstones indicated white and yellow colored, gem?type diamonds \nweighing 0.750 and 0.497\u00a0carats, respectively, and possibly \ndodecahedral (Karfunkel et\u00a0al. 2014). As\u00a0for surface features \nassociated with transport, the authors reported absence of per?\ncussion marks and severe breakage, reflecting completely differ?\nent transport and deposition histories from what is observed, \nfor example, in Diamantina diamonds (Karfunkel et\u00a0al. 2014). \nAlthough\u00a0analyses of only two stones do not represent statistical \ndata, the results are very similar to those obtained by Robinson \net\u00a0al. (1995) on 201\u00a0diamonds from alluvium of the Santo \nAnt\u00f4nio do Bonito, Santo In\u00e1cio and Douradinho rivers. Also, \nkimberlite ilmenite and garnet with keliphitic coronae or with \nalmost intact alteration mantles were recovered in the Canastrel \ndigging, indicating absence of transport (Karfunkel et\u00a0al. 2014).\n\nDIAMOND-BEARING ALLUVIUM\n\nRecovery of diamond with other kimberlite minerals in \nalluvium does not imply in common primary source. As\u00a0a \nrather robust mineral, diamonds resist to transport over large \ndistances, being incorporated into sediments carried along \ndifferent drainages by capture processes and, therefore, in the \nmajority of cases, without any genetic link with the other kim?\nberlite minerals present in the deposit. However, the agreement \nbetween certain localities of diamond and kimberlite occur?\nrences in the San Francisco Craton is not random (Fig.\u00a013).\n\nFigure 12.

The\u00a0diamonds contained in the \nCretaceous Tau\u00e1 conglomerates in Romaria and in the basal \nconglomerate of the Capacete Formation, in other areas of \nthe Santo Ant\u00f4nio do Bonito, Santo In\u00e1cio and Douradinho \nriver basins, are considered as originating directly from local \nprimary sources, which were not properly located up to now \n(Pereira 2007).\n\nAs emphasized above, diamond?bearing kimberlites, \nespecially those aged between 120 and 90\u00a0Ma, occur in \ndifferent points of Alto Parana\u00edba, some of them constitut?\ning the primary sources of diamonds recovered in alluvial \ndeposits associated with the current drainage and exploited \nas digging areas.\n\nThe peridotitic garnet window of high interest inferred \nin exploration of diamond?bearing kimberlite corresponds to \nkimberlite clusters located in the Coromandel region, some \nof which hidden beneath the conglomerate (Pereira 2007).\n\nThe main sources of alluvial diamond deposits in the drain?\nage to the south and southeast of Coromandel, especially in \nthe Santo Ant\u00f4nio do Bonito, Santo In\u00e1cio and Douradinho \nrivers, are the basal conglomerates of the Capacete Formation \nand rocks of the Arax\u00e1, Ibi\u00e1 and Canastra groups, which serve \nas bedrock for the conglomerates (Fernandes et\u00a0al. 2014; \nKarfunkel et\u00a0al. 2014). Also,\u00a0kimberlites of different ages, \nkamafugites and related rocks contributed to the formation \nof the alluvium associated to the current drainage. In\u00a0certain \ndiggings, it is possible to recognize fragments or pebbles of \nkimberlites with marked characteristics. For\u00a0example, in the \ndiggings of the Vendome Mines company, the small mounds \nof pebbles and fragments of extremely silicified kimberlite \nobserved in the yard of the treatment plant, or \u201cosso de boi\u201d \n(\u201cox\u00a0bone\u201d) as called by the diggers, come from the erosion \nof an extensive strip of silicified kimberlite, consisting of \ndikes and blows, that extends for more than 10\u00a0km along \nthe roughly north?south right bank of the Santo Ant\u00f4nio do \nBonito River (Figs.\u00a014\u00a0and\u00a015). Currently, digging activities \nin the region are restricted to the river terraces, as it is for?\nbidden to throw tailings in the active bed of the drainage.     \n\nAmong the rivers and tributary streams carrying the same \ndiamond population in the region, the Santo Ant\u00f4nio do \nBonito, Santo In\u00e1cio and Douradinho rivers are the most \nimportant ones. The\u00a0largest diamonds in the country were \nfound in this area (Fig. 16). The\u00a0average value of the stones \nfrom Coromandel ranges from US$\u00a0200.00 to US$\u00a0 300.00/ ct \n(Pereira 2007).\n\nThe batch of 201 diamonds studied shows a unique char?\nacteristic, totally different not only from the stones from the \n\nsouthern portion of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton but also from \nother regions in Brazil. Typically, the stones are brown, occa?\nsionally yellow or gray, and usually distorted. The\u00a0rounded \ndodecahedron shape is the most common one, with no rem?\nnants of octahedral and cubic faces. Finely\u00a0spaced lamination \nlines and zig?zag patterns are quite common. About\u00a090% \nof the diamonds do not show evidence of transport, a fact \nthat, added to the 12\u00a0stones with fragile shapes or twinning, \nsuggests proximal and primary source. The\u00a0provenance study \nof this batch emphasizes that no peculiar differences were \ndetected in any of the streams that indicated individual pop?\nulations. In\u00a0addition, inclusion of silicates or olivine and \ngarnet are rare, while sulfide was found only in two stones \n(Robinson et\u00a0al. 1995; Pereira 2007).\n\nThe peridotitic garnet window of high interest inferred in \nexploration of diamond?bearing kimberlite and alluvium is \ncorroborated by the magnetotelluric profile surveyed between \nthe Paran\u00e1 and Sanfranciscana basins (Bologna et\u00a0al. 2006). \n\nFigure 14.

Despite of the reduced \narea or extent of thick lithosphere, its presence is important \nbecause it indicates that the Archaean?Paleoproterozoic ter?\nrain of the western border of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton was \ncharacterized by thick lithosphere, capable of crystallizing \nand preserving diamond.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nProbably from the Pleistocene to the Holocene, the \nlarge flat plateau area observed in the southwestern por?\ntion of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton that developed during \nTertiary peneplanation in Brazil and South America started \nto undergo erosive processes. In\u00a0this area, remains of the \nold surface showing the lateritic cover that character?\nizes the top of the erosion surface can be seen. In\u00a0some \ncases, the incision of the current drainage reaches the \nrocks of the Arax\u00e1, Ibi\u00e1 and Canastra groups. The\u00a0basal \nconglomerate of Capacete Formation, in a frank erosion \nprocess, is the main source of the diamond?bearing allu?\nvium of the Santo Ant\u00f4nio do Bonito, Santo In\u00e1cio and \nDouradinho rivers. However, rocks of different ages from \nthe magmatism associated with Alto Parana\u00edba also con?\ntributed to the formation of alluvium. Observations\u00a0of \nthe diamond?bearing alluvium indicate only one high \nterrace level. Apparently, the region underwent little \nmovement or block accommodation after the Tertiary, \nunlike, for example, the Serra da Canastra region, where \nthe areas upstream of the Vargem Bonita digging, on the \nS\u00e3o Francisco River, show three distinct terrace levels. \nThe\u00a0pebble distribution in the alluvium is less chaotic, \nindicating currents with greater capacity to concentrate \nthe dispersed diamond in the basal conglomerate of the \nCapacete Formation, considered as the secondary source \nof the diamond recovered to the south and southeast of \nCoromandel (Figs.\u00a018 and\u00a019). Despite all indications \nof\u00a0source or local primary sources for the diamonds con?\ntained in the conglomerate and concentrated in alluviums, \nsuch sources have not yet been located.\n\nCertain factors, or the conjunction of factors, may hin?\nder the location of certain intrusions in the region, espe?\ncially of the potentially diamond?bearing Early Cretaceous \nkimberlites. The\u00a0aeromagnetic survey conducted in the \nCoromandel region was considered a great success in \nterms of responses associated with intrusions. Thousands \nof anomalies compatible with kimberlite intrusions were \nselected and hundreds were positive in field follow?up, \n\nespecially of kamafugites and related rocks intruded in \nthe Late Cretaceous. The\u00a0 Mata da Corda volcanism is \nextremely magnetic and capable of masking any under?\nlying individual anomaly. For\u00a0example, analysis of drill \ncore samples from 56 selected anomalies, including the \nOmega 22 intrusion at the top of the Chapad\u00e3o, the com?\nmon source area of the Santo Ant\u00f4nio do Bonito, Santo \n\nFigure 19.

Finally,\u00a0a rarer, but not uncommon case, would \nbe either little or non?magnetic kimberlite emplaced in the \ndescribed situations (Fig.\u00a020).\n\nAt the time of the systematic exploration conducted in \nthe region, a gravimetric survey was considered, however \nthe high cost of gravimetry associated with the size of the \narea made the project unfeasible.\n\nSome studies should be carried out as an attempt \nto reduce the area for an eventual gravimetric survey in \nthe southern and southeastern regions of Coromandel, \nas\u00a0follows: \n1. Surveying all occurrences or outcrops of the basal con?\n\nglomerate of the Capacete Formation.\n2. Analyzing the frequency of angular fragments or peb?\n\nbles of volcanic rocks, especially kimberlites, and the \nnature of the more or less sandy or clayey matrix of the \noutcrops.\n\n3. Collecting at least 500 L of the material, with special \ncare to avoid contamination.\n\n4. Recovering the heavy minerals up to the panning level.\n5. Analyzing specially garnet and spinel, and, in the case \n\nof diamond recovery, performing provenance studies.\n\nThe set of results could indicate more accurately the \nproximity to possible primary diamond sources, helping to \ndefine the most appropriate area for the gravimetric survey, \nor even for drilling, following a convenient grid of bore?\nhole distribution if the reduced surveying area is compati?\nble with the cost.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nGeological knowledge is cumulative and continually \nupdated through research and collection of information \ninserted in a given context of paradigms.\n\nIn 1968, SOPEMI \u2013 Pesquisa e Explora\u00e7\u00e3o de Min\u00e9rios \nS.A,, a joint venture between France\u2019s BRGM (Bureau de \nRecherches G\u00e9ologiques et Mini\u00e8res) and CAEMI (Antunes \nGroup), discovered the first kimberlite in the Santo In\u00e1cio \nRiver, in the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton. In\u00a01974, after the BRGM \ndeparture, the De Beers Group, which had joined SOPEMI, \ntook control of the company. Since then, De Beers and \nother companies invested continuously for more than two \ndecades in diamond prospecting in Brazil and other coun?\ntries in South America, discovering hundreds of kimberlites \nand related rocks.\n\nThe main research focus was the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton, \ncovering the digging areas in the regions of Len\u00e7\u00f3is, Andara\u00ed, \nMucug\u00ea in the Chapada Diamantina, in the northern por?\ntion of the craton, but intensive work was also conducted in \nthe traditionally producing areas of southwest Minas Gerais, \nin the southern portion of the craton.\n\nAmong the most used techniques worldwide to explore \nkimberlite and lamproite are the sampling and recovery of \nheavy minerals such as garnet, spinel, diopside and ilmen?\nite, followed by aerial or terrestrial geophysics and remote \nsensing. The\u00a0combined data obtained using these techniques \nbecome important when searching for favorable targets of \nkimberlite intrusion. The\u00a0data include petrology, mineral?\nogy, geochemistry, geochronology, geophysics, remote sens?\ning, and, if possible, additional field work, such as grain size \nand soil color variations, specific local anomalies of certain \nvegetation species and minerals identified in the waste of \nanthills or termite mounds.\n\nIn the region of Alto Parana\u00edba, an aeromagnetic sur?\nvey was extremely effective, allowing the direct detection \nof hundreds of kimberlites and/or related rocks. The\u00a0cov?\nerage of the Coromandel area, with 8,520\u00a0km2, in three \nstages, allowed selecting 1,184 anomalies, which were \n\nTertiary deposit\n\nMata da Corda Formation \n(Late Cretaceous)\n\nKimberlite/related rock \n(Late Cretaceous)\n\nCapacete Formation \nbasal conglomerate\n\nDiamond-bearing \nkimberlite (120-90 Ma)\n\nCanastra Group\nBasement\n\nFigure out of scale\n\nChapad\u00e3o (1,100 meters)\n\n900 \u2013 1,000 meters\n\nFigure 20.

Among the 986 tested, \n435\u00a0intrusions (44%) were proven, of which 120 (27.6%) \ncorrespond to already known kimberlites/related rocks \n(Skinner\u00a01996; Pereira 2007). To\u00a0reach these results, a lot of \nwork had to be done to define the anomalies only in this area.  \nApproximately\u00a015,600\u00a0km/line, with 50\u00a0x 25\u00a0m intervals \nbetween the lines and stations and 100\u00a0x 50\u00a0m in the terres?\ntrial magnetometry survey, covered the 986 anomalies, clas?\nsifying them as good (485), medium (211) and poor (290). \nApproximately\u00a033,594\u00a0samples were collected, including \n22,161\u00a0soil, 7,750\u00a0alluvium, 3,080\u00a0drill cores, and 603\u00a0rock \nsamples (Skinner 1996; Pereira 2007).\n\nThe S\u00e3o Francisco Craton exploration yielded two import?\nant results; it identified a thick lithosphere capable of crys?\ntallizing and preserving diamond in the northern portion, \nand located diamond?bearing kimberlites in the southern \nportion of the craton.\n\nThe kimberlites of the Bra\u00fana Province, in the north \nportion of the craton, located in the Archean core of the \ncentral portion of the Serrinha Block, are diamondiferous \n(Pereira &amp; Fuck 2005; Pereira 2007; Donatti et\u00a0al. 2013a, b). \nThe\u00a0Salvador 01 kimberlite was also identified in Chapada \nDiamantina, Gavi\u00e3o Block, whose outcrops show low?grade \nmetamorphism, hypabissal facies and phlogopite Rb?Sr age \nof 1,152\u00a0Ma. The\u00a0kimberlite was considered at the time as \nsin deposition of the diamond?bearing conglomerate of the \nTombador Formation. Subsequently, aeromagnetic survey \nin the region indicated anomalies northwest of Salvador \n01 (SVR\u00a001). Drilling detected kimberlitic rocks at 246 \nand 159\u00a0m in two anomalies. Drill cores show crater facies \nrocks, metamorphosed and placed at the base of the Morro \ndo Chap\u00e9u Formation quartzites, therefore intrusive in \nthe rocks that constitute the underlying Tombador and \nCaboclo formations. The\u00a0findings indicate a time of intru?\nsions younger than the primary sources that provided dia?\nmonds to the known diamondiferous Tombador Formation \nconglomerates (Pereira 2007).\n\nIn the south portion of the craton, the De Beers min?\neral exploration indicated the location of diamond?bear?\ning kimberlites, constituting, in some cases, the primary \nsource of the diamonds extracted from the bed alluvium \nand terraces of certain streams. In\u00a0addition to the identifi?\ncation of diamond?bearing kimberlites in Alto Parana\u00edba, \nexploration also identified the conglomerate containing \nangular pebbles of basic and ultrabasic rocks, quartzites, \nshales and amphibolites, underlying the Mata da Corda \nGroup. The\u00a0conglomerate outcrops show distribution of \npebbles without any sorting and deposition in rugged \nrelief, where normal faults are common. Sampling of the \nconglomerate indicates in some places presence of abun?\ndant garnet, spinel and ilmenite of high interest with \n\nkelifitic coronae or alteration mantles, comprising more \nthan 50% of the mineral, implying in reduced transport \nor local origin.\n\nMore recent work has contributed significantly to \nthe knowledge of the post?Gondwana stratigraphy in \nAlto Parana\u00edba (Sgarbi et\u00a0al. 2001; Fernandes et\u00a0al. 2014; \nKarfunkel et\u00a0 al. 2014). In\u00a0 addition to confirming the \npresence of diamond in the basal conglomerate of the \nCapacete Formation, the description of diamonds recov?\nered in the Canastrel digging, extracted directly from the \nconglomerate (Karfunkel et\u00a0al. 2014), sheds light on the \nfact that the components of this formation constitute \nthe secondary source of diamonds extracted in the allu?\nvium of the Santo Ant\u00f4nio do Bonito, Santo In\u00e1cio and \nDouradinho rivers.\n\nThe presence of diamond?bearing kimberlites at different \nlocations in the region and the identification of thick litho?\nsphere capable of crystallizing and preserving diamond, asso?\nciated to the recovery of kimberlite minerals extracted directly \nfrom the conglomerate with characteristics of local origin, \nas well as diamonds with little transport, allow to strongly \nconsider the presence of YPP sources, which eroded, fed the \nbasal conglomerate of the Capacete Formation. These\u00a0min?\nerals, including diamond, were later reconcentrated in the \nalluvium of the Santo Ant\u00f4nio do Bonito, Santo In\u00e1cio and \nDouradinho rivers.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors are grateful to the editors and review?\ners of BJG for all the fruitful comments and suggestions. \nRAF\u00a0thanks CNPq for financial support through INCT \nEstudos Tect\u00f4nicos and research fellowship.
