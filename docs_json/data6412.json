XX, atrav\u00e9s da realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de diversas teses acad\u00e9micas, an\u00e1lise de dados de arrojamentos que focaram a ocorr\u00eancia de esp\u00e9cies ao longo da costa e alguns aspectos de ecologia alimentar, e ainda projectos sobre interac\u00e7\u00e3o com artes de pesca. Tem sido tamb\u00e9m, e de forma continuada, estudada e monitorizada a popula\u00e7\u00e3o residente de golfinhos-roazes (Tursiops truncatus) do Estu\u00e1rio do Sado, actualmente constitu\u00edda por 24 indiv\u00edduos identificados. Na \u00faltima d\u00e9cada, estudos no Norte do Pa\u00eds apontam para a possibilidade de uma popula\u00e7\u00e3o residente de botos (Phocoena phocoena) na Figueira da Foz e no centro possivelmente ocorrem duas popula\u00e7\u00f5es residentes na Arr\u00e1bida e na Costa da Gal\u00e9.\nActualmente, o estudo de popula\u00e7\u00f5es costeiras de golfinhos e baleias na costa Oeste de Portugal est\u00e1 a ser levado a cabo por algumas equipas de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o que come\u00e7am a publicar os resultados em confer\u00eancias nacionais e internacionais e em algumas revistas da especialidade. No entanto, pouco se sabe ainda sobre as principais zonas de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o das esp\u00e9cies, de que forma utilizam os seus habitats e sobre estimativas de abund\u00e2ncias para a costa continental portuguesa de Norte a Sul.\nNo presente estudo, o principal objectivo foi compreender quais as esp\u00e9cies com maior ocorr\u00eancia numa \u00e1rea de estudo composta por tr\u00eas zonas geogr\u00e1ficas distintas (P\u00f3voa de Varzim, Nazar\u00e9/Peniche e Sesimbra), e analisou-se a sua distribui\u00e7\u00e3o nessas mesmas \u00e1reas tendo em conta par\u00e2metros ambientais como a temperatura do mar \u00e0 superf\u00edcie, a profundidade do local do avistamento e a dist\u00e2ncia \u00e0 costa. Focando apenas golfinho-comum, descrito por v\u00e1rios autores como a esp\u00e9cie\nde maior ocorr\u00eancia em Portugal continental, foi ainda feita uma descri\u00e7\u00e3o das principais actividades comportamentais nas zonas amostradas.\nA metodologia aplicada a este estudo baseou-se em sa\u00eddas de mar para observa\u00e7\u00e3o de cet\u00e1ceos, tendo sido aproveitadas sa\u00eddas de oportunidade (que aconteceram independentemente de projectos direccionados ao estudo de cet\u00e1ceos) e sa\u00eddas de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o (inseridas em projectos da Escola de Mar e do Centro de Oceanografia). Em cada sa\u00edda foi registada a esp\u00e9cie, a data e hora, a posi\u00e7\u00e3o GPS, o tamanho do grupo, a presen\u00e7a de crias e as principais actividades comportamentais, bem como factores ambientais como a temperatura, a profundidade e a dist\u00e2ncia \u00e0 costa. Apesar de n\u00e3o terem sido integrados na an\u00e1lise, dados como o estado do vento e do mar e a presen\u00e7a de aves marinhas foram tamb\u00e9m registados.\nNo total foram realizadas 100 sa\u00eddas de mar que perfizeram um total de 18 647 minutos de esfor\u00e7o e das quais resultaram 81 avistamentos independentes de cet\u00e1ceos, nas tr\u00eas regi\u00f5es amostradas. Tal como esperado, a esp\u00e9cie com maior ocorr\u00eancia foi golfinho-comum (Delphinus delphis), observado durante todo o ano em grupos de 1 a uma centena de indiv\u00edduos embora na maior parte dos casos em grupos de 1 a 10 animais, com a presen\u00e7a de crias. A esta esp\u00e9cie seguiram-se golfinho-roaz, golfinho-riscado (Stenella coeruleoalba), boto e baleia-an\u00e3 (Balaenoptera acutorostrata). Em Sesimbra, golfinho-comum e golfinho-roaz distribuem-se de forma distinta, podendo ser considerada a exist\u00eancia de uma parti\u00e7\u00e3o do habitat segundo caracter\u00edsticas ecol\u00f3gicas distintas de ambas as esp\u00e9cies. Foram encontradas diferen\u00e7as em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a aspectos de din\u00e2mica de grupos, como por exemplo na presen\u00e7a de crias (p<0,05), frequente em grupos de golfinho-comum (59%) e pouco frequente para golfinho-roaz (17%), bem como nas principais actividades comportamentais registadas. Golfinho-comum utiliza a \u00e1rea de estudo, principalmente a zona de Sesimbra, para todas as suas actividades di\u00e1rias como desloca\u00e7\u00e3o (54%), alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o (29%), socializa\u00e7\u00e3o (15%) e repouso (2%). Golfinho-roaz foi apenas\nobservado em desloca\u00e7\u00e3o, embora deva ser considerada uma poss\u00edvel sobrevaloriza\u00e7\u00e3o desta actividade, j\u00e1 que a desloca\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 inerente \u00e0 alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o e os indiv\u00edduos t\u00eam obrigatoriamente de se deslocar entre zonas de alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o, dada a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o irregular dos cardumes de que se alimentam.\nForam tamb\u00e9m observadas diferen\u00e7as significativas em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s zonas de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de ambas as esp\u00e9cies, nomeadamente na an\u00e1lise dos par\u00e2metros profundidade (p<0,05) e dist\u00e2ncia \u00e0 costa (p<0,05). Os grupos de golfinho-comum observados distribu\u00edram-se em zonas de maior profundidade (min.=25m, m\u00e1x.=400m, x=96,15m, d.p.=67,23, n=50) e mais afastadas de costa (m\u00edn.=409m, m\u00e1x.=19.491m, x=6.308m, d.p.=5.313, n=59) enquanto os grupos de golfinho-roaz se distribu\u00edram em zonas pouco profundas (min.=5m, m\u00e1x.=180m, x=50,78m, d.p.=73,48, n=9) e mais pr\u00f3ximo de costa (min.=232 m, m\u00e1x.=12.700 m, x=3.162m, d.p.=3.728, n=13). Uma prefer\u00eancia por diferentes presas pode contribuir para estes resultados, evitando assim competi\u00e7\u00e3o directa por recursos entre ambas as esp\u00e9cies. Por outro lado, \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m colocada a hip\u00f3tese dos grupos de golfinho-roaz utilizarem a \u00e1rea de Sesimbra como um corredor de desloca\u00e7\u00e3o entre as suas principais \u00e1reas de ocorr\u00eancia. Esta zona geogr\u00e1fica tem caracter\u00edsticas especiais \u00e0 ocorr\u00eancia de cet\u00e1ceos, n\u00e3o s\u00f3 pelo seu car\u00e1cter de protec\u00e7\u00e3o relativamente a algumas actividades humanas dado pelo Parque Marinho Luiz Saldanha, mas tamb\u00e9m pela exist\u00eancia dos canh\u00f5es de Set\u00fabal e de Lisboa que lhe garantem uma produtividade elevada e consequentemente uma importante riqueza marinha.\nTamb\u00e9m em Sesimbra, golfinho-comum foi avistado em associa\u00e7\u00e3o a golfinho-riscado. Esta \u00faltima esp\u00e9cie de h\u00e1bitos oce\u00e2nicos pode aproximar-se de costa seguindo presas pel\u00e1gicas e assim formar grupos mistos que eventualmente lhe permitem um maior sucesso na captura de alimento. Golfinho-comum foi tamb\u00e9m observado numa \u00e1rea muito pr\u00f3xima a baleia-an\u00e3 e, fora do nosso esfor\u00e7o de amostragem, a acompanhar a desloca\u00e7\u00e3o de uma baleia-corcunda. Apesar de n\u00e3o ser\nnosso objecto de estudo, \u00e9 de interesse revelar que foram observados v\u00e1rios golfinhos-comum com cortes na barbatana dorsal na Nazar\u00e9 e em Sesimbra, bem como uma baleia-an\u00e3 enredada e ferida por um cabo.\nA maior limita\u00e7\u00e3o deste estudo foi a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de sa\u00eddas de mar nem sempre direccionadas \u00e0 observa\u00e7\u00e3o de cet\u00e1ceos, dificultando por vezes a recolha dos dados, bem como o n\u00famero distinto de amostras recolhidas em cada zona da \u00e1rea de estudo, n\u00e3o possibilitando uma compara\u00e7\u00e3o geogr\u00e1fica. Outra falha que dever\u00e1 ser colmatada nas pr\u00f3ximas campanhas relaciona-se com a metodologia aplicada ao estudo do comportamento a qual dever\u00e1 ser dedicada. No caso de golfinho-comum, a an\u00e1lise dos seus padr\u00f5es comportamentais \u00e9 ainda pouco estudada a n\u00edvel global e a aposta nessa \u00e1rea de estudo tem bastante interesse.\nDe futuro prev\u00ea-se o desenvolvimento do estudo de cet\u00e1ceos na zona centro, que se pretende continuado e cada vez mais consistente, atrav\u00e9s da utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de transectos os quais j\u00e1 est\u00e3o delineados para a \u00e1rea de Sesimbra. S\u00f3 atrav\u00e9s desta metodologia ser\u00e1 poss\u00edvel estimar a abund\u00e2ncia das esp\u00e9cies e calcular o tamanho das popula\u00e7\u00f5es. Ser\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m organizado um cat\u00e1logo de foto-identifica\u00e7\u00e3o para as esp\u00e9cies golfinho-comum e golfinho-roaz, de forma a compreender poss\u00edveis padr\u00f5es de resid\u00eancia sazonais ou permanentes. Por outro lado, \u00e9 essencial que as fotografias de golfinho-roaz sejam comparadas com as das barbatanas j\u00e1 identificadas dos indiv\u00edduos do Estu\u00e1rio do Sado. Dada a proximidade entre a popula\u00e7\u00e3o residente e golfinhos oce\u00e2nicos \u00e9 de extrema relev\u00e2ncia que se verifique atrav\u00e9s, deste m\u00e9todo, se estar\u00e1 a ocorrer algum n\u00edvel de interac\u00e7\u00e3o entre grupos. Sugere-se ainda, como projecto futuro, uma an\u00e1lise das interac\u00e7\u00f5es com artes de pesca na zona centro de Portugal continental.\nEstudos sobre popula\u00e7\u00f5es costeiras de cet\u00e1ceos devem ser alvo de maior aten\u00e7\u00e3o na costa continental portuguesa. \u00c9 sabido que um n\u00famero significativo de esp\u00e9cies utiliza \u00e1guas continentais portuguesas mas n\u00e3o est\u00e3o identificados os\npar\u00e2metros ecol\u00f3gicos que definem esse uso. Abund\u00e2ncia, padr\u00f5es de resid\u00eancia, uso de habitat, actividades comportamentais, estatuto de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o, entre outros temas, devem ser a base para as quest\u00f5es futuras que devem ser colocadas, estudadas e respondidas.\nPalavras-chave: Cet\u00e1ceos, Ocorr\u00eancia, Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o, Habitat, Comportamento, Golfinho-Comum, Golfinho-roaz, Portugal.\nABSTRACT\nThe present study analyzes the occurrence of cetaceans off the West Portuguese Coast between 2007 and 2009. A total of 100 boat-based surveys were conducted in a study area composed by three locations (P\u00f3voa de Varzim (41 \u00b0N), Nazar\u00e9/Peniche (39\u00b0N) and Sesimbra (38\u00b0N)), from which resulted 81 independent sightings of cetaceans. Five species were observed: common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba), harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) and minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata). Common dolphin was the most frequent species followed by bottlenose dolphin and the distribution of these two species was analyzed within the same geographic area where habitat partitioning seems to be occurring. Group dynamics (including group size, presence of calves and behavioural activities) and habitat parameters (including SST, depth and distance from shore) were compared. Differences were found for the presence of calves, behavioural activities, depth and distance from shore, possibly due to ecological differences between species. A description of behavioural activities of common dolphin was also promoted in order to understand the behavioural patterns of the species. Travelling was the most observed activity, followed by feeding, socializing and resting, namely in Sesimbra where the species seems to conduct all its daily life activities. Mixed groups of common dolphin and striped dolphin were registered three times in the same location and can be considered an advantage for striped dolphin, an oceanic species that approach to coast sporadically. During our campaign, several common dolphins presented injuries in its dorsal fins and one minke whale was entangled in cables and fishing nets. Cetaceans\u2019 research along the Portuguese coast has a lot of topics that should be\nstudied in the near future, namely abundance, patterns of residency, habitat use, behavioural patterns and conservation status.\nKeywords: Cetaceans, Occurrence, Distribution, Habitat, Behaviour, Common dolphin, Bottlenose dolphin, Portugal.\nCHAPTER 1: GENERAL INTRODUCTION\n1.1.\tAn introduction to cetaceans\u2019 ecology\nCetaceans occupy a large proportion of the ocean's habitats from coastal waters to neritic waters over continental shelves and estuarine systems or even rivers, using the water column, being confined to relatively shallow depths or diving to thousand of meters. In different habitats cetaceans show differential development of adaptations which reflect selective pressures of the environments in which they function. The relation between a species and its habitat form the basis to define a species' ecological niche and to allow a prediction of distribution and abundance, as also the identification of core requirements, critical knowledge for effective management and conservation. Furthermore, cetaceans are apex predators and they affect the life history strategies and population biology of their prey as well as of organisms at other trophic levels in the ecosystem to which they belong (Ballance, 2009).\nLike many animals, cetaceans form aggregations for feeding and for protection. Being gregarious, cetaceans can bring the fishing school together and easily capture their prey, as also the coordinated effort reduces the time devoted to foraging, which means a gain of energy for other activities. On the other hand, cooperation makes the group stronger and ensures the protection of vulnerable individuals, reducing the probability of predation on any one individual and increasing the chance of detection of a predator (Gowans et al., 2008; Balance, 2009). Groups of cetaceans are considered as mutualists since their relations are based on exchange of mutual benefits and only mutualist groups allow the formation of social bonds between individuals (Connor,\n2000). The interactions between elements of a group include mating and sexual\nactivities, play and game, interactions of dominance and also maternal behaviours (Evans, 1987), which can be secondary benefits of schooling (Ballance, 2009).\nThere seems to be a correlation between school size and feeding habitats. Species that form large schools are almost all shallow-diving species that feed mainly on schooling prey, whereas those which occur in smaller school size (25 animals or less) tend to be deep-diving species or coastal species feeding on dispersed prey. This is due to predation pressure and resource availability (Norris and Dahl, 1980; Ballance,\n2009). There is also a tendency for small populations of cetaceans, particularly dolphins, to become temporarily or permanently resident in small areas, forming a network of fluid associations (fusion/fission) between individuals. In these small groups, individuals hunt alone, also with a preference for solitary prey (Gowans et al., 2008).\nFinally, although most schools are monospecific, several species can occur in mixed-species groups. These associations appear to be opportunistic, for example in cases of food concentrations, between species of coastal and oceanic species (Ballance, 2009; Connor, 2000).\n1.2.\tReview of cetaceans\u2019 occurrence in coastal waters of the Northeast Atlantic\nAlthough coastal waters are primarily occurrence zones of small cetaceans, they are included in migrations routes, between feeding and reproduction areas of baleen whales off European coast. Fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) and sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) are frequent species, followed by blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) and humpback whale (Megaptera novaengliae), this one with a more coastal distribution. Minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) is the commonest of all the rorquals (Evans, 1987). This species is amongst the most widely distributed of all baleen whales, ranging from tropical to polar waters, frequently observed in coastal or shelf waters (Reeves et al., 2008). Sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) is also\nreported to this area when moving northwards probably following deep ocean basins west of the Iberian Peninsula and British Isles (Evans, 1987).\nIn the last decade, several projects were developed as an attempt to estimate the abundance of cetaceans in European waters, namely SCANS I, SCANS II (Small Cetaceans in the European Atlantic and North Sea) and CODA (Cetacean Offshore Distribution and Abundance in the European Atlantic). For CODA an area of 968 000 km2 was surveyed off the continental shelves of Britain, Ireland, France and Spain in July 2007. The aims of the project were to estimate the abundance and investigate the habitat use of cetacean species in waters beyond the continental shelf. The best estimates were 116 709 common dolphins (Delphinus delphis), 67 414 striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba), 19 295 bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), 25 101 long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas), 2 077 sperm whales, 6 765 minke whales, 9 019 fin whales, and 6 992 beaked whales. The results were intended to inform assessments of conservation status of all cetacean species, inform assessments of the impact of bycatch of common dolphin, and inform assessments of the impact of anthropogenic sound on deep-diving whales (Hammond et al., 2009).\nConcerning just the common dolphin, which is the most abundant species in Europe, recent regional and local projects have been developed approaching subjects such as distribution and abundance (Macleod et al., 2003; Certain et al., 2008; De Boer et al., 2008; Robinson et al., 2010) and feeding ecology (Pusineri et al., 2007). Regarding behaviour ecology, no studies have been conducted in Europe, so far. New Zealand waters (Neumann, 2001; Stockin et al., 2009) and Mediterranean (Bearzi et al., 2003; Ca\u00f1adas and Hammond, 2008) are the most well documented regions for this subject.\n1.3.\tReview of cetaceans\u2019 occurrence off Portugal mainland coast\n1.3.1. Coastal populations\nThe information about the occurrence of cetaceans in Portuguese mainland coastal waters has always been very sparse and fragmented. Along the years, whaling data, historical and strandings as well as opportunistic observations have given information about the occurrence of an extensive list of mysticetes and odontocetes. For these integrated studies, the results vary according to the geographic location but all point common dolphin as the more frequent species, followed by bottlenose dolphins or striped dolphins and harbour porpoises (e.g. Teixeira, 1979; Sequeira, 1988; Brito et al., 2009). Other odontocetes as Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus), pilot whales (Globicephala sp.), killer whales (Orcinus orca) and sperm whales have been referred. Regarding baleen whales, blue whales, fin whales, sei whales, humpback whales and minke whales, these are included in the \u201cobserved at sea\u201d or \u201ccaptured\u201d lists (e.g. Teixeira, 1978; Sequeira, 1988; Brito et al., 2009).\nConsidering that common dolphin is the most observed species off Portugal mainland, studies about its feeding ecology (Silva, 1999) and interactions with fisheries were also promoted (Wise, 2007). Nevertheless, the majority of the studies conducted consist in academic theses and presentations at scientific meetings, indicating that a complete and continuous field-based study about distribution and abundance of cetaceans is still missing. There are currently some research teams trying to promote field-based research in the northern and central areas off the west coast, whose results are starting to be analysed.\nKnown since the 19th century (Bocage, 1863), the existence of a resident population of bottlenose dolphins in the Sado estuary has always been the primary focus of cetaceans study in Portugal mainland. With some references along the 20th century, from the 1980\u2019s this population has been constantly monitored (Teixeira and Duguy, 1981; dos Santos, 1985; dos Santos and Lacerda, 1987) and a photo-identification study was started. A continuous approach along the years enabled an estimative for the size of the population and has confirmed the decrease of the \u201cSado dolphins\u201d. Firstly, in 1982, estimated as forty animals (dos Santos and Lacerda, 1987), seven years later as thirty (Gaspar, 1994), twenty later as 26 (Augusto, 2007) and nowadays the entire group is identified and is composed by 23 individuals: 5 juveniles and 18 adults (www.projectodelfim.com visited in 11.06.2010).\nThe long term study of this population, unique in Portugal and one of the smallest in Europe, has allowed an increasing information about this nucleus in particular and the species Tursiops truncatus in general, in themes such as acoustic (dos Santos et al. 1990; Couchinho, 1999; Brito, 2001; Pican\u00e7o, 2003) and behaviour and feeding ecology (Harzen, 1995; dos Santos, 1998; Carvalho, 2003; dos Santos et al., 2007). Moreover, patterns of residency and movements have been studied and the occupancy of the estuary as of the adjacent coastal waters are well documented (e.g. C\u00e2ndido, 2003; Augusto, 2007).\n1.3.3.\tResident populations of harbour porpoises\nAlong the continental shore, predominantly in the north, this species is observed in Aveiro/Figueira da Foz, Arr\u00e1bida and Costa da Gal\u00e9 (Martins, 1998; Cabral et al.,\n2005). It has also been reported to an area between Porto and S. Pedro de Moel\n(Ferreira, 2008). The patterns of residency of harbour porpoises are believed (Cabral et al., 2005) but are not yet understood since its study is not facilitated. The animals are seen only briefly and partially as they break the surface to breathe, they are comparatively small and are usually alone or in small groups of two to five individuals (Reeves et al., 2002).\nThere is a current need of information about this species in European waters, since one of its primarily threat is by-catch and incidental mortality in fisheries (Parsons et al., 2010).\n1.4.\tObjectives\nThe main aim of this study was to analyse the occurrence, diversity and habitat use of cetaceans off the West Portuguese coast.\nMore specifically, two questions were addressed:\n-\tAre common dolphins and bottlenose dolphins partitioning the same habitat?\n-\tWhich are the most frequent behavioural activities of common dolphins in Portuguese waters?\n1.5.\tReferences\nAugusto, J.

Between January 2007 and October 2009, we observed occurrence and distribution of both species in three locations off Portugal mainland coast and analysed differences between species considering group dynamics (group size, presence/absence of calves and behaviour) and habitat parameters (sea surface temperature, depth and distance to coast). From a total of 81 independent sightings of cetaceans, 60 were of common dolphins and 13 of bottlenose dolphins. Both species were observed mostly in small groups (45% and 50% respectively). 59% of common dolphins' groups included calves in opposite of groups of bottlenose dolphins, composed predominantly by adults (17% sightings with calves). Common dolphins were observed travelling, feeding, socializing and resting, while bottlenose dolphins were only observed travelling. Differences were also found when comparing habitat preferences, with common dolphins occurring preferentially in deepest waters and more distant to coast and bottlenose dolphins in shallower waters near shore. The results suggest that habitat partitioning is occurring due to differences in these species' ecological niches.\nKeywords: ecology, habitat partitioning, common dolphin, bottlenose dolphin, Portugal\nIntroduction\nCetacean distribution data along the Portuguese coast is limited to a few sources and more detailed information about habitat use and patterns of residency is missing. It is known that short-beaked common dolphin, (Delphinus delphis Linnaeus, 1758); hereafter common dolphin) is the more frequent species followed by common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus Montagu, 1821); hereafter bottlenose dolphin)\n(Teixeira, 1979; Wise et al., 2005; Brito et al., 2009). A better understanding of dolphins populations' ecological niches, specifically for these two species, is relevant for conservation and management decisions, designing Marine Protected Areas when needed and implementing new technologies both inshore and offshore. Plus, the knowledge of habitat use of bottlenose dolphins allows the understanding of the levels of interaction, competition or mutualism relations that they may have with resident populations.\nCommon dolphins have a widely distribution from continental shelf and pelagic waters of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans along shelf edges and in areas with sharp bottom relief such as seamounts and escarpments. (Reeves et al., 2002). It is the most abundant species in European Atlantic (Hammond et al., 2009) and in the Mediterranean is found in groups of a few individuals to several hundred, with of calves present year-round. In this region common dolphins exhibit a relatively flexible feeding habits and have a preference for epipelagic and mesopelagic fish, occupying areas of submarine canyons (Bearzi et al., 2003).\nBottlenose dolphins occur in warm temperate to tropical waters, very close to shore, in bays and mouths of rivers, as well as in the open ocean. Inshore bottlenose dolphins inhabiting shallow waters form small groups between 3 and 10 individuals but these units are not closed. Other communities of bottlenose dolphins, which occur in adjacent habitats and non-resident individuals are often observed within one community's core range area (Gowans et al., 2008). The social structure of bottlenose dolphins is characterized by dynamic units varying from stable and resident groups to groups continually changing in size and membership over time and a fluid association between these two kinds of structure (Balance, 1990).\nThe co-occurrence of two or more species of the family Delphinidae in the same geographical area is very common and has been reported for D. delphis and T. truncatus in the Mediterranean (Bearzi, 2005a). This sympatry could lead to habitat\npartitioning for two reasons: the species avoid each other in consequence of interspecific competition or they have ecological differences and occupy different niches (Roughgarden, 1976; Bearzi, 2005b). The present study aims to infer about the habitat use of common dolphins and bottlenose dolphins in Portuguese mainland coast. It would be expected, considering the ecological differences between the species, that they do not enter in direct competition but naturally distribute unequally.\nMaterial and Methods\nStudy Area\nThe study area includes three locations in the west Portuguese coast: P\u00f3voa de Varzim (41\u00b0N), Nazar\u00e9/Peniche (39\u00b0N) and Sesimbra (38\u00b0N) (Fig. 1). The oceanographic characteristics of these 3 locations are very dissimilar concerning the type of slope and oceanographic features. The northern zone is characterized by a continuous continental shelf without exuberant demographic accidents, and the central and southern zones by submarine canyons, namely Nazar\u00e9, one of the largest and deepest canyons of Europe, Lisboa and Set\u00fabal (Mougenot, 1989). These locations are important fishing spots of the Portuguese coast and they all are in the vicinity or included in Marine Protected Areas: Parque do Litoral Norte (P\u00f3voa de Varzim), Reserva Natural das Berlengas (Nazar\u00e9/Peniche) and Parque Marinho Prof. Luiz Saldanha (Sesimbra).\nData Collection and Analysis\nData was collected from January 2007 to October 2009 and two different survey methods were utilized: platforms of opportunity and research dedicated boat-based surveys. Both surveys consisted in non systematic surveys in which the vessel route was determined at the start of each day, based on prevailing weather conditions and aiming to acquire greatest spatial coverage. All the boat trips were conducted during\nday-light period, between 8am and 18pm. Whenever cetaceans were sighted the vessel position, species, group size, group composition and predominant behavioural activity were recorded. Depth in the moment of sighting was registered from vessel sonar and distance from shore was afterwards calculated for each sighting using ArcView 9.1 GIS software.\nA\nN\na\nSPAIN\nPORTUGAL\nStudy Areas\n1\t- Pdvoa de Varzim\n2\t- Nazare/Peniche\n3\t- Sesimbra\nFig. 1. Study area including the three different locations off Portugal mainland and showing batimetric lines.\nSea surface temperature (SST) was obtained from http://www.medspiration.org/ and the values are the mean temperature of an area of 4 km2 (2 km from shore to ocean x 2\nkm parallel to shore). A group was defined as any number of animals observed in association, moving in the same direction and engaging in the same activity (Shane, 1990). Group size was classified as 1-10; 11-20; 21-50; 51-100 and group composition included presence of calve/juvenile (one-half and one-third the length of an adult) and adult (any animal > 1,80m) (Stockin et al., 2009). Behaviour was recorded in four categories (adapted from Shanne, 1990; Stockin et al., 2009): traveling (dolphins engage in persistent, directional movement, making noticeable headway), feeding (dolphins exhibit nondirectional movement, frequent changes in heading prevent animals from making headway in any specific direction), socializing (dolphins chasing, copulating or engage in any other physical contact with other dolphins) and resting (dolphins stay close to the surface in a tight group, engaged in slow maneuvers with little evidence of predictable than observed in other behavioural states).\nTo analyse differences in the habitat use between common dolphins and bottlenose dolphins a qui-square test was used to infer group dynamics (group size, group composition and behaviour) and Mann-Whitney U-test (Statistica v.9) were used for habitat parameters (SST, water depth and distance from shore).\nResults\nSpecies occurrence\nA total of 99 boat-based surveys were conducted (20 in P\u00f3voa de Varzim, 21 in Nazar\u00e9/Peniche and 58 in Sesimbra). A total of 18 647 minutes of survey data were collected resulting in 81 independent sightings of cetaceans. Including the three geographic locations, 5 species were detected during the survey period and in just one occasion was not possible to identify the Delphinidae species. Common dolphin was the most observed species (n=60), followed by bottlenose dolphins (n=13), striped dolphins (n=4), harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) (n=2) and minke whales\n(Balaenoptera acutorostrata) (n=2). Common dolphins were sighted at the three surveyed locations and bottlenose dolphins in Nazare/Peniche and Sesimbra (Fig. 2). Mixed groups of common dolphins and striped dolphins were registered (n=3). Mixed groups of common dolphins and bottlenose dolphins were never found and the two species were never observed in the same day.\nFig. 2. Distribution of common dolphin (n=60) (black spots) and bottlenose dolphin\n(n=12) (grey stars) in three different locations off Portugal mainland, between January 2007 and October 2009.\nGroup dynamics\nFor both species the most recorded group size was 1-10 individuals, in 45% sightings of common dolphins (n=22) and 50% of bottlenose dolphins (n=6), followed by groups of 11-20. No significant differences were found between group sizes of common\ndolphins and bottlenose dolphins. The presence of calves/juveniles was significantly higher for common dolphins (59%, n=34) than for bottlenose dolphins (17%, n=2) (p<0,05). Common dolphins were observed travelling (n=28), feeding (n=15), socializing (n=8) and resting (n=1) while bottlenose dolphins were observed only travelling (n=10). A summary of these results is shown in Table 1.\nTable 1.

Habitat variables of Delphinus delphis and Tursiops truncatus sightings: (A) sea\nsurface temperature, (B) depth and (C) distance from shore.\nFor SST only the months between April and October were included, because no encounters with bottlenose dolphins were registered outside this period. Common dolphins were observed at a mean SST of 17,25\u00b0C (range=14,45\u00b0C-20,35\u00b0C, s.d.=1,51, n=53) and bottlenose dolphins at a mean of 17,99\u00b0C (range=16,21\u00b0C-19,32\u00b0C, s.d.=1,10, n=12) but no significant differences were found between species.\nThe depth range of common dolphins sightings varied from 25 m to 400 m with a mean depth of x=96,15 m (s.d.=67,23, n=50) and for bottlenose dolphins between 5m and 180m with a mean depth of x=50,78 m (s.d.=73,48, n=9). This difference between deeper and shallower waters was significant between the two species (p<0,05) with common dolphins exhibiting a preference for deeper waters.\nThe mean distance from shore observed for common dolphins was 6 308 m and varied from 409 m to 19 491 m (s.d.=5 313, n=59) and for bottlenose dolphins the\nmean distance was 3 162 m and varied from 232 m to 12 700 m (s.d.=3 728, n=13). Significant differences were found between the two species (p<0,05), showing the preference of common dolphins for deepest waters.\nDiscussion\nOccurrence and association of species\nCommon dolphin was the most observed species, registered in the three surveyed locations, followed by bottlenose dolphin, as already described for Portugal mainland coast by other authors (e.g. Teixeira, 1979; Brito, 2009). Bottlenose dolphins were mostly observed in Sesimbra (n=12) and were never seen with common dolphins in the same day (even though seen in the same week and in some occasions in the day before) suggesting that habitat partitioning is occurring.\nStriped dolphins were registered most of the times in mixed-groups with common dolphins as also described for other regions worldwide (Frantzis and Herzing, 2002; Ca\u00f1adas and Hammond, 2008). Being an offshore species, striped dolphins can use this association as an advantage when coming to shallower waters to follow coastal preys (Qu\u00e9rouil et al., 2008).\nGroup dynamics\nCommon dolphins were observed year-round in small groups with calves, in travelling, feeding and socializing. The species seem to use the study area to conduct all the activities of its daily life, traveling between feeding areas, foraging and establishing relations with its co-specifics, including mating. Bottlenose dolphins were observed also in small groups, mostly without calves and traveling.\nApparently these two species are using the habitat with different purposes, since their behavioural activities were very distinctive and their distribution unequal. It\nshould however be noted that the behavioural activity travelling for bottlenose dolphins may be overestimated in prejudice of feeding. It is possible that our survey effort did not included the most active periods if we take into account that this species may feed mostly in the early morning and late afternoon (Shane et al., 1986). On the other hand, contrary to what it was observed for common dolphin, in several occasions bottlenose dolphins not only do not approach the boat as they move away. Bottlenose dolphins have a herd structure with different formations, and the group structure seems to change, namely in fear reactions. The animals gathered together underwater and emerged in a densely packed group far away from the danger (Bel\u2019kovich et al. 1991) which can drive the observer to register another behavioural activity from the original.\nBeing travelling the more observed activity we can expect that migration plays an important role in cetaceans\u2019 distribution (Gowans and Whitehead, 1995). Food resources are rarely uniform throughout the environment and predators need to travel between feeding areas. Also, the organization in small groups, as observed in this study, may be an improvement for more efficient foraging strategies because preys are often distributed over many small patches, as also reported for both species in the Mediterranean (Ca\u00f1adas and Hammond, 2008).\nNevertheless, the social structure of bottlenose dolphins is very complex. Fluctuations on group sizes probably occur, with an influx of new individuals on closely groups (Zolman, 2002). This is an important issue since the area of Sesimbra is nearby the Sado Estuary where a population of T. truncatus is resident, and is actually an object of a governmental conservation plan, and it is of primary importance to understand if the different populations have some level of interaction.\nHabitat variables\nConsidering the environmental parameters analysed, no differences were found in SST values between the two species, and depth and distance to coast were in fact the explanatory variables for habitat use and partitioning by D. delphis and T. truncatus.\nCommon dolphins seem to have a preference for deepest waters, with a mean depth of 96,15m and a mean distance to coast of 6 308 m. In this case, submarine canyons can have an ecological importance based on its optimal features for mixing nutrients and consequently richness in prey for cetaceans (Hui, 1979; Hooker et al., 1999; de Stephanis et al., 2008). This can lead common dolphins to Nazar\u00e9/Peniche and Sesimbra where submarine canyons are present. Bottlenose dolphins were observed very close to shore, with a mean depth of 50,78 m and a mean distance to coast of 3 162 m, but in P\u00f3voa de Varzim (the northern location surveyed near shore and characterized by low depth) the species was never observed during our campaign. This can lead to a hypotheses based on a superabundance of food resources which attracts different species within a same geographic area (Selzer and Payne, 1988).\nMoreover, the study area in Sesimbra includes a particularly important marine protected area (Parque Marinho Prof. Luiz Saldanha), where restrictions to fisheries are being imposed since 1998. This can be seen as a potential factor in creating an interesting spot to feed as happens in other regions (e.g. Toth et al., 2010). It has been described that D. delphis and T. truncatus may differ in distribution and prey preference as a consequence of competition for resources in inshore waters (e.g. Bearzi et al., 2005). The diet of common dolphins seem to change with geographical areas and according to seasonal fluctuations in prey distribution but in the study area an examination of stomach contents reported by Silva (1999) pointed sardine (Sardina pilchardus) as the most important prey due to the abundance of this pelagic species in our coast. Bottlenose dolphins are more opportunistic feeders adapting their diet to\nprey availability and differing among seasons, habitats, age and sex (Shane et al., 1986; Gannon and Waples, 2004).\nIt is also possible that bottlenose dolphins use the area in Sesimbra as a coastal-corridor with a certain level of fidelity as known for this species worldwide (Defran and Weller, 1999; Bearzi et al., 2009). The species tends to exhibit varying degrees of residence to particular regions, ranging from small localized inshore populations, apparently resident to specific embayments, to larger numbers of migratory coastal dolphins which appear to move latitudinally on a seasonal basis (Wang et al., 1994).\nAlthough the number of sightings of bottlenose dolphins was relatively low, the present study offers new insights on the distribution and habitat use of D. delphis and T. truncatus and is a first approach about habitat partitioning of both species in Sesimbra. As expected, the species seem to have different ecological niches and it does not seem to exist a direct competition for resources. Further research and the analyses of the photo-id catalogue need to be promoted to better understand the relations between species and resident populations.\nReferences\nBallance, L.T. (1990).

The aim is to present information about activity budget, group size and group composition in three different locations of Portugal mainland coast. A total of 100 boat-based surveys were conducted between January 2007 and October 2009 from which resulted 60 observations of common dolphins and 52 independent observations of behavioural activities, including travelling, feeding, socializing and resting. Travelling was the most frequent activity (54%), followed by feeding (29%), socializing (15%) and resting (2%). Groups between 1-10 individual were the most frequently sighted (45%), followed by groups of 11-20 (25%), 21-50 (20%) and 51-100 (10%). One event of socializing included persecution, belly-to-belly\ncontact and copulation, occasionally involving the repetitive intercourse of the same female by different males. Mixed-groups of common dolphins were also recorded, namely with striped dolphins. It seems that common dolphin uses the study area to conduct all the activities of its daily life.\nKeywords: activity patterns, behaviour activities, common dolphin, Portugal\nIntroduction\nShort-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) have a wide distribution along the continental shelf and pelagic waters of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, gathering in schools of dozens, hundreds or thousands individuals, very active at surface and preferentially feeding on small schooling fish (Evans, 1994; Reeves et al., 2002). The schools of common dolphins are thought to be composed of small subunits of about 20 to 30 individuals, probably closely related (Evans, 1994). There may be segregation in schools by age and sex (Perrin, 2009) and association with schools of other dolphins' species have been observed (Evans, 1994; Frantzis and Herzing, 2002).\nPublished information regarding common dolphins' activity budget exist for New Zealand (Neumann, 2001; Stockin et al., 2009), studies on feeding behaviour exist for Mexico (Gallo Reynoso, 1991) and New Zealand (Newmann and Orams, 2003) and in the Mediterranean several studies concerning distribution, density and conservation status include data about behavioural activity (e.g. Bearzi et al., 2003; Ca\u00f1adas and Hammond, 2008). In spite of this, little is known about behavioural ecology of common dolphins worldwide, namely for Atlantic European waters. In Portugal mainland this species is the most frequently sighted along the coast (Teixeira, 1979; Wise et al., 2005, Brito et al., 2009) and although some themes as feeding ecology (e.g. Silva,\n1999)\tand interaction with fisheries (e.g. Wise et al., 2007) have been approached, a behavioural ecology study has not been promoted yet. Here we present the first data about behavioural activities, activity budget, group size and group composition of common dolphins in Portuguese mainland waters.\nMaterial and Methods\nBoat-based surveys were conducted in three different locations of Portuguese mainland coast, P\u00f3voa de Varzim (n=20), Nazar\u00e9/Peniche (n=21) and Sesimbra (n=58)\n(Fig.1).\nFig. 1. Study area including three different locations along Portugal mainland coast, from January 2007 to October 2009.\nA total of 99 surveys were conducted between January 2007 and October 2009, with a total of 18 647 minutes at sea. Two independent observers were scanning for sightings. For each encounter a field-sheet was completed with species identification, GPS position, group size and composition and behavioural activity in the first moment of the sighting. Environmental conditions, as SST and depth, were also recorded. Individuals and groups were colour photographed with Nikon D50 and D70 equipped with 75-300 mm and 75-400 mm lens in order to register the behavioural activity, and when possible video taped. During the encounters a group's focal approach was used (Mann, 1999). A focal individual-follow was not conducted due to the difficulty to identify always the same individual in the group; firstly, its dorsal fins are not as marked and recognizable as, for example, the dorsal fin of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), and secondly, groups are very fluid and its elements frequently changed their position.\nA group was defined as any number of animals observed in association, moving in the same direction and engaging in the same activity (Shane, 1990). For each encounter four categories were used to characterize group behavioural activities observed and were defined (adapted from Shanne, 1990; Stockin et al., 2009) as Travelling: dolphins engage in persistent, directional movement, making noticeable headway; Feeding: dolphins exhibit nondirectional movement, frequent changes in heading prevent animals from making headway in any specific direction; Socializing: dolphins are chasing, copulating or engage in any other physical contact with other dolphins, and Resting: dolphins stay close to the surface in a tight group engaging in slow maneuvers.\nThe group size was classified as 1-10; 11-20; 21-50; 51-100 and group composition included presence of calve/juvenile (one-half and one-third the length of an adult) and adult (any animal > 1,80m) (Stockin et al., 2009). Any event of other\ncetaceans\u2019 species observed near (<100m) the focal group was considered as a mixed-group (Stockin etal., 2009).\nResults and Discussion\nA total of 60 independent encounters with common dolphins and 52 independent observations of behavioural activities were recorded. The most observed activity was traveling (54%, n=28), followed by feeding (29%, n=15), socializing (15%, n=8) and resting (2%, n=1) (Figs. 2 and 3).\nFig. 2. Sightings of behavioural activities, traveling (black spots), feeding (grey spots) and socializing (white spots) of common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) in three different locations of Portugal mainland coast, between January 2007 and October 2009.\nFig. 3. Percentage of occurrence of behavioural activities of common dolphins off Portugal mainland, between January 2007 and October 2009 (n=52).\nResting was recorded just once and was excluded from the rest of the analysis. However it is possible that this activity was underestimated because when resting, the animals show no conspicuous surface activity which difficult group localization. Also, it was suggested by Neumann (2001) that the approach of the vessel may induce a switch from resting to other activities. In fact, short-beaked common dolphins often approach the research vessels and bow ride the wave (Perrin, 2009).\nTravelling and feeding are known to often relate due to movements and variability of the prey (Newmann, 2001). Considering that food availability is the most important factor in determining an animal's activity budget, other behavioural activities will only be frequent after nutritional needs are satisfied (Doenier et al., 1997). On the other hand, food resources are rarely uniform throughout the environment and predators need to travel between feeding areas.\nGroups between 1-10 individuals were the most frequently sighted (45%) of the total encounters, followed by groups of 11-20 (25%), 21-50 (20%) and 51-100 (10%). Because preys are often distributed over many small patches it can be more efficient\nfor dolphins to split into smaller groups (Ca\u00f1adas and Hammond, 2008). This may explain why traveling and feeding comprised the largest proportion of groups of 1-10 animals observed (50% and 43% respectively). Socializing was more frequent in groups of 11-20 animals (43%) (Fig. 4). This activity included copulation in one occasion, in a group of 11-20 animals, as well as persecution, belly-to-belly contact, with or without copulation, occasionally involving the repetitive intercourse of the same female by different males during the same observation. This is an identical behaviour to what has been described for New Zealand by Neumann (2001) and for Mediterranean by Ca\u00f1adas and Hammond (2008).\nTraveling\tFeeding\tSocializing\nGroup size\nFig. 4. Group size of common dolphin during traveling, feeding and socializing (n=49).\nFig. 5. Copulation of short-beaked common dolphin in Sesimbra. Photograph by Nina\nVieira in 2009.\nCalves were present in 65% of the total encounters and in 64% of traveling, 80% of feeding and 34% of socializing (Fig. 6). It is believed that the reproduction of common dolphins is nonseasonal (Reeves et al., 2002) and the frequency of observations of calves throughout the year is concurrent to other studies (e.g. Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid and Alnitak, 2002; Stockin et al., 2008).\n\u25a1 with calves \u25a1 without calves\n100\n90\n80\n70 a>\n60\n\u00a7\t50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\nTraveling\nFeeding\tSocializing\nBehavioural activity\nFig. 6. Presence and absence of calves in common dolphin groups during traveling, feeding and socializing (n=51).\nDuring the surveys some relevant behavioural events were detected. Aerial behaviour typical of common dolphins was frequently within our study area, such as the \u201cpitch poling\u201d (Fig.7). The dolphin leaps high vertically and falls lengthwise back into the water to create a large splash (Perrin, 2009). In other regions this behaviour is described for socializing activities and can also play a role in the context of non-vocal communication (Lusseau, 2006).\nMixed groups were found between common dolphins and striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba). During our study period, striped dolphins were observed four times, in Sesimbra, traveling (n=1) and travelling and feeding (n=3) with common\ndolphins in groups of 21-50 (n=2) and 51-100 (n=1). The association of these two species is not uncommon (e.g. Frantzis and Herzing, 2002; Ca\u00f1adas and Hammond,\n2008)\tand it can be seen as an advantage to striped dolphins when coming to shallower waters to follow coastal preys (Qu\u00e9rouil et al., 2008). Common dolphins were also sighted in the vicinity (>100m) of a minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) in Sesimbra, and during observations of opportunity (outside our survey effort) in close proximity of humpback whale (Megaptera novaengliae) (Fig. 7). It is known that common dolphins may approach mysticetes to \u201cbow ride\u201d, which is possibly the origin of bow riding vessels (Perrin, 2009).\nFig. 7.

Mixed group of common dolphins and humpback whale off Sesimbra.\nPhotograph by Lu\u00eds Quinta.\nOverall, common dolphins use the study area to conduct all the activities of its daily life. Further and long term research is needed to clearly understand their behaviour, habitat use and patterns of residency along the coast of Portugal mainland. In the future a consistent behavioural study with focal-observations of individuals, both from boat and land platforms, and a creation of a photo-id catalogue will be promoted.\nReferences\nBearzi, G., Reeves, R.R., Notarbartolo-di-Sciara, G., Politi, E., Ca\u00f1adas, A., Frantzis, A. and Mussi, B.

Scientia Marina 71,405-412.\nCHAPTER 4: GENERAL DISCUSSION\n4.1.\tCetaceans\u2019 occurrence off the West Portuguese Coast\nFrom the results of our effort between January 2007 and October 2009, five species of cetaceans were identified off Portugal mainland coast including four species from the suborder Odontoceti, common dolphins, bottlenose dolphins, striped dolphins and harbour porpoises, and one species from the Mysticeti, minke whales.\nThe occurrence and distribution of common and bottlenose dolphins were analyzed through environmental parameters to infer about habitat use in the study area and habitat partitioning seems to be occurring between the two species in Sesimbra. Common dolphins are the most sighted species and their importance in coastal communities of cetaceans along the coastline will be addressed ahead.\nBottlenose dolphins are relatively well known and are the most studied small cetacean species, mainly due to their worldwide distribution (Shane et al., 1986) and coastal or inshore habitats. In Portugal, they occur near shore and are resident in the Sado Estuary (dos Santos and Lacerda, 1987; Augusto, 2007). Generally, they show a preference for shallower waters and probably for different prey species as a response to its ecological characteristics and adaptations to distinct environments. The plasticity and the opportunistic habits of this species allow an incursion from ocean to coastal waters and seasonal or permanent ecological and behavioural adaptations to shallow or confined waters. This issue is particularly important since the region of Sesimbra is probably within the range distribution of the resident population of bottlenose dolphins in Sado Estuary. This small resident population is threatened and presently is protected under an Action Plan of Conservation. The possibility of an encounter between these different groups (coastal and resident) is considered but needs to be monitored. A\ncatalogue of photo-identification of individuals observed in Sesimbra is now being undertaken.\nStriped dolphins occur worldwide in tropical and temperate waters (Rice, 1998) and is one of the most frequent species in adjacent waters of Portugal (Certain et al., 2008; de Stephanis, et al., 2008). A study on feeding ecology in the Bay of Biscay (Spitz et al., 2006) pointed out that individual striped dolphins have oceanic habits but make temporary incursions over the shelf. This capacity requires enough ecological and behavioural plasticity to exploit coastal habitats, including the use of areas characterized by submarine canyons which create spatially defined patterns in food availability (Gannier, 1999). Also the association with other species, typical of striped dolphins, is an advantage to forage coastal preys (Qu\u00e9rouil et al., 2008). From our results, showing their presence in mixed-groups with common dolphins, we can consider that the sightings of striped dolphins in Sesimbra are related with the availability of resources in this region. A study dedicates to this species has never been conducted in Portugal mainland, although its status is \u201cLeast Concern\u201d in the ICNB Red List.\nHarbour porpoises are usually difficult to survey due to their small size and undemonstrative behaviour at the surface (Hammond et al., 2002). Most probably the number of sightings recorded in this study is underestimated (only 2 observations were registered in P\u00f3voa de Varzim). Resident populations are suspected to exist in Cape Mondego, Arr\u00e1bida and Costa da Gal\u00e9 so it would be expected to have more sightings in our surveyed locations near those regions. Although it is consider widespread some conservation measures are being implemented and much of the research about harbor porpoises has focused on by-catch (Hammond et al., 2009). There are some evidences of decline in abundance in some areas as, for instance, in the Black Sea (Hammond et al., 2008). In Portugal the status of the species is \u201cVulnerable\u201d mainly due to by-catch in fishing vessels (Cabral et al., 2005). The lack of information about density and\nhabitat use makes very difficult to understand the degree of impact of human activities in the populations of small cetaceans (Wise et al., 2007).\nThe only species of baleen whale observed, minke whale, is usually found in the North Atlantic during summer (Rice, 1998; Robinson et al., 2009) as occurred in this study (observations between March and September). Its conservation status is \u201cVulnerable\u201d for Portugal mainland coast because the species is found very near shore and is involved in fishing accidents (Cabral et al., 2005). During and outside our survey campaign at least two minke whales were found alive entangled in cables and fishing nets (Fig.1). We can only speculate if the animals are approaching the coast for protection after getting entangled or if they are being injured in the area. In either case a more detailed study about the interaction of cetaceans with fishing activities within a continuous research and conservation program should be implemented.\nFig. 1. Entangled minke whale off Sesimbra, in 2009. Photo from Nina Vieira.\nFrom this study it can be noticed that Sesimbra is a very important area for cetaceans. This area has two characteristics which can be advantageous for these animals: 1) it is a sheltered region due to restrictions to fisheries and nautical activities by the rules of the marine park Prof. Luiz Saldanha, 2) important oceanographic features may increase the abundance of feeding resources for cetaceans. More studies about this issue are required since it was not our aim to analyze the abundance of preys in the region. Also, it is known, from whaling data, observation of opportunity and\ngrey-literature, that others species of cetaceans, dolphins and baleen whales, occur in Portuguese waters. Due to the objectives of this work, and the research projects in which was inserted, all the boat surveys covered inshore habitats, so we did not expected to find more species of mysticetes. For future projects it will be relevant to extend the surveyed areas a little more offshore.\nAs stated before, common dolphin is the most frequent species of Portuguese mainland west coast and has been observed in the three locations surveyed. The present study analyzed their occurrence according to different environmental parameters such as sea surface temperature, depth and distance from shore. Distribution in sympatry with bottlenose dolphins, predominant behavioural activities and association with another species were also analyzed. The initial objectives were achieved and are resumed in the papers presented.\nCommon dolphins occurred year-round with calves in groups typically with 1 to 10 animals although, in some cases, groups of one hundred of individuals were observed. With a preference for epipelagic and mesopelagic fish, namely sardine (Sardina pilchardus) (Silva, 1999), the species may explore submarine canyons and adjacent waters. Our study area has optimal features for prey richness and the sightings of groups of common dolphins travelling and feeding around the 100m depth may indicate that they are using it as feeding areas. Common dolphins seem to use the Portuguese coast for all its daily vital activities including foraging with different techniques, and breeding. A more directed study about behaviour ecology of this species with designed methodology for behavioural research is required in order to further study the habitat use of this species.\nIt was also observed that common dolphins form mixed-groups, namely with striped dolphins, possible in a mutualist association for both species, and may have a sympatric relation with bottlenose dolphins in some locations. Common dolphins have no conservation status in the Portuguese Red List but it is known that the species is the\nmain target of by-catch off Portugal mainland coast (Wise et al., 2007) and during our campaigns several individuals were observed with serious injuries in dorsal fins (Fig.\n2). Once again, a study about the interactions with fisheries regarding both by-catch and depredation should be considered in a near future.\nFig. 2. Common dolphin injured off Sesimbra. Photos from Cristina Brito.\n4.2.\tPresent constraints and future approaches\nOverall, further research is needed and urgent for common dolphin as well as for other cetaceans\u2019 species occurring off Portugal. An estimative of abundance in Portugal mainland does not exist for each species, the information about their feeding ecology is sparse and the first steps on behavioural activities and habitat use are being done at this moment. Only with a better understanding of cetacean populations, and most particularly common dolphins, it is possible to identify and monitor the impact of relevant human activities, which can range from fisheries, to dolphin watching programs and new technologies both inshore and offshore. Ecological aspects as mating and breeding seasons, occurrence depending on SST, and availability of prey resources can only be studied with long term and uniform approaches. Transect distance sampling should be the next step in cetacean research off Portugal mainland coast to obtain information on density and size of cetaceans\u2019 populations (Faustino,\n2010). Linear transects in P\u00f3voa de Varzim and Sesimbra were already defined by our research team and it is our goal to implement this designed survey in the next campaigns.\nIn synthesis the study of cetaceans has grown up in Portugal over the last 30 years and seems to have gained more importance in this new decade. Some academic theses are trying to contribute to improve the research in our waters, some papers are being published and participation on conferences of the specialty is being promoted. It is known that a significant number of species use, in some way, Portuguese waters but the ecological parameters which define that use are not identified. Abundance, patterns of residency, habitat use, behavioural activities, status of conservation, among other topics, are some of the questions that need to be made, studied and answered. Regarding conservation and management of marine resources and habitats it is expected a more pro-active attitude from Portuguese governmental institutions, as happened this year with a great step forward with the ratification of Portugal as a party to the ASCOBANS (Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic and North Seas).\n4.3.\tReferences\nAugusto, J.
