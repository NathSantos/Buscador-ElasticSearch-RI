This kind of problem arises in several engineering applications, among them the flow around oil risers, vortex induced vibration and flow-structure interaction, semi-submersible platforms and other offshore structures subjected to sea currents, such as oil storage facilities. This latter is a crucial problem connected to the safety of the environment. The structural design of the facilities, anchoring-systems design and propulsion requirements, in the case of non--anchored systems, require accurate calculation of drag and lateral forces. Furthermore, structural components subjected to fatigue, such as risers or anchoring systems require time-resolved information about the forces applied by the flow.\nThe solution of those engineering problems frequently benefits from the CFD simulation of the unsteady, three-dimensional flow around complex geometries. However, as pointed out by Lardeau and Leschziner (2005) and Menter (2012), the Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier--Stokes (URANS) approach presents some weaknesses when employed for the simulation of flows with massive separation. It is known that the largest turbulent structures have a time scale that is not very different in magnitude from the time scale of vortex shedding. It follows that the unsteadiness of a bluff body wake is strongly influenced by turbulence. Since in URANS simulations all the turbulence scales are represented by the eddy viscosity through Reynolds ensemble averaging, the unsteady interactions of the large turbulent eddies with the wake are misrepresented. This is why some authors such as Menter (2012) suggest that URANS is advisable only when there is a clear separation of time scales between the largest turbulent eddies and the main flow.\nAnother shortcoming of URANS modeling is related to the Boussinesq assumption used to linearly relate the Reynolds stresses to the strain rate through the isotropic eddy viscosity. Unfortunately, the large turbulent eddies are strongly anisotropic and it is believed\nthat their influence is not well represented by the eddy viscosity. Moreover, as can be seen in Craft (2012), the use of the Boussinesq assumption results in overproduction of turbulent energy close to stagnation points, which is another hindrance to the simulation of the flow around bluff bodies. The excess of produced turbulent kinetic energy results in premature transition of the boundarylayer, incorrect position of separation points and dissipation of turbulence structures in the wake. As a counter-measure, Kato and Launder (1993) proposed an ad-hoc modification for the turbulence production term of the kinetic energy equation where the vorticity is used in conjunction with the strain rate, so that the production is calculated as Pk=mTS W. The idea was to use the influence of the non-rotational flow close to the stagnation point as a deterrent to the excess of kinetic energy production, but this approach has not been widely used.\nThe application of Reynolds-Stress transport models for URANS simulations could be a solution to some of the difficulties arising from the Boussines assumption, but the additional large number of transport equations add up to an increase in computational time and convergence problems. Replacing the Boussinesq assumption through non-linear eddy viscosity models, when the Reynolds stresses are related to the velocity gradients through quadratic or cubic expressions, also has some negative effects on convergence behavior of the computations. However, it is noteworthy that Mannini et al. (2010), in their two-dimensional computations of the flow around rectangular cylinders, obtained better agreement with experiments when using non-linear explicit algebraic stress models coupled with the two-equation standard k-o model.\nHowever, the best alternative to the shortcomings of URANS modeling, at least in order to have better accuracy at the expense of computational cost, seems to be the use of Scale-Resolving models. Rodi (1993) was one of the first to notice that Large Eddy Simulation (LES) results in better predictions of the flow around bluff bodies. The large, anisotropic eddies are directly resolved, and the Boussinesq assumption is used to model only the smaller scales that are isotropic in nature. Nevertheless,\nalthough LES is becoming more widely accepted, the fact is that the computational costs related to the fine meshes and small timesteps still make the technique prohibitive for the majority of CFD users, mainly those interested in industrial applications and seeking practical engineering results. It is interesting to notice that LES is particularly expensive to compute boundary layers, due to large requirements in the number of cells to correctly capture the small eddies close to the walls. For this reason, LES models are frequently employed with some sort of wall-modeling.\nOn the other hand, RANS models are accurate and cheap for the computation of boundary-layer flows, a characteristic that has led to the development of hybrid RANS-LES models, where the near-wall flow is solved through a RANS model that progressively turns into a LES model when the distance from the wall is increased. This approach, currently called Detached Eddy Simulation (DES), was first introduced by Spalart et al. (1997) as an economical alternative to the use of LES. The first RANS model chosen for the practice of DES was the Spalart-Allmaras model, but since the k-o SST model from Menter (1994) has been proven very effective for the simulation of external flows with adverse pressure gradients, it did not take long for the appearance of a DES model based in the SST RANS model, as can be seen in Menter et al. (2003).\nIn DES, the transition from RANS to LES simulation is performed through a comparison between the mesh cell size and the turbulent length scale calculated through the RANS model. It is said that DES has an explicit dependence from the mesh resolution. Some researchers, on the other hand, argue that it would be better to develop a simulation technique where the transition from RANS to LES is a natural outcome of the resolved velocity field itself. In this case, there would be an implicit dependence on the mesh size, i.e. a good mesh resolution would allow the development of turbulent eddies triggering a self-adaptive process that would lead to a scale-resolving simulation. This technique was proposed by Menter and Egorov (2005) and is generally called Scale Adaptive Simulation (SAS).\nThrough the above evaluation of turbulence models, the SST URANS model, the SST-SAS model and the Dynamic Smagorinsky-Lilly LES model were selected to perform the simulations for the challenge proposed by the organizing committee of the 2012 Conference of the CFD Society of Canada. On that occasion preliminary results were presented in Maliska etal. (2012) and it is intended here to enhance the discussion with further considerations.\nComputer model\nGoverning equations\nThe flow is considered as incompressible and isothermal, and the governing equations are the mass and momentum conservation in their differential form, given by,\n|-(jp) + V.(pu) = 0\t(1)\n-^(pu)-V.(puu)=\t(2)\nwhere,\nT = //(Vu + Vur-2/3IV.u)\t(3)\nrepresents only the viscous (deviatory) component of the stress tensor for a Newtonian fluid. Even being an incompressible flow, the equations were presented in this way as this is the form used in the numerical package employed in the simulations, ANSYS-CFX13\u00ae.\nDepending on the approach adopted for the turbulence calculation, the momentum equation could be averaged (for the RANS approach) after the application of Reynolds decomposition on velocity and pressure fields,\nor filtered (for the LES approach). According to Pope (2000), the Reynolds-averaging procedure considering an eddy viscosity based model for the turbulent stress tensor leads to,\n, i\t11\t. -i .\u25a0 i\t(4)\nwhere meff = m + mT is the effective viscosity and k is the turbulent kinetic energy. This variable and the turbulent viscosity,mT, are calculated through the k-o SST model. Here, the variables in capital letters represent averages of instantaneous variables (in lowercase).\nOn the other hand, for scale-resolving models as LES, the momentum equations are not averaged, but filtered as can be seen in Layton (2002), giving,\n||(pU) + V-(/?UU) = -VP + V-(//<(VU + VUr)) + f + V-t(5)\nwhere, introducing a sub-grid turbulent viscosity, one has\n(6)\nThe sub-grid turbulent viscosity, m SGS, takes into account the contribution of the turbulent eddies, whose scales are smaller than the mesh size (and therefore not calculated), to the turbulent diffusion.\nThe SAS model consists of a URANS model, typically the k-o SST in the proposal from Menter and Egorov (2010), in which the von Karman length scale is introduced in the o equation through a source term, allowing the model to dynamically adjust to resolved structures and resulting in a LES-like behavior in the detached regions and RANS behavior in the near-wall regions.\nTurbulence modeling\nIn the URANS approach, all scales of the turbulent motion are modeled. In two-equation eddy-viscosity models\nlike the k-o SST model the Boussinesq assumption is used to represent the Reynolds stresses, as\n(7)\nOn the other hand, through the spatial filtering operation performed in LES, the large scales of the flow are directly solved, and since the large eddies are responsible for the majority of the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum of the flow, the smaller eddies can be modeled through very simple approaches like the Smagorinsky model, from Smagorinsky (1963). In this model, the sub-grid stresses are modeled by,\n(8),\nwhere,\n(9).\nIn this last equation, D is the LES filter width that separates the resolved from the modeled scales, and it is related to the mesh spacing. In this work, D was taken as the cubic root of the cell volume. This is a very common practice when using LES and is the reason why there is the need for an almost isotropic mesh, with cells having almost the same dimensions in all directions, in order that the calculation of the mesh length scale is not hampered by the existence of high aspect-ratio cells.\nThe Smagorinsky constant Cs is often considered in the range 0.1-0.25. In the present work the Dynamic Smagorinsky-Lilly model, from Lilly (1992), was employed and Cs was not taken as a constant, but dynamically evaluated for each cell during the time-stepping procedure following a method proposed by Germano et al. (1991).\nThe Scale Adaptive Simulation\nThe Scale-Adaptive Simulation (SAS), from Menter and Egorov (2005), is a hybrid RANS-LES technique that\naddresses the issues related to LES through the utilization of a RANS k-w SST model as a base model. The transport equation for the specific dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy (w) is modified in relation to the RANS model through the addition of a source term related to the Von Karman length scale Lvk.\nThe SAS model can develop a range of turbulent scales in detached flow regions related to the mesh refinement and adopted time step. The influence of the spatial resolution is introduced through the Von Karman Length Scale, related to the velocity derivatives (equation 10), instead of using the mesh size as in the LES approach. If L>Lvk, meaning that the RANS length scale is larger than the length scale of the larger resolved eddies, the source term in the w equations increases the production of w, and so increases the dissipation of kinetic energy. In other words, in boundary-layer regions the SAS model behaves as a RANS model, and in detached regions the SAS model works as a LES model, capturing the main complex 3D turbulent structures of the flow.\nAccording to Menter and Egorov (2010), the norm of the deformation rate tensor S could be considered as the inverse of a time scale related to the solved vorticity field. A non-uniform distribution of S would be representative of a range of vorticity scales. The original idea of using the distribution of S to calculate a length scale related to the solved turbulence was proposed by Rotta (1968). Adapting this idea Menter and Egorov formulated the Von Karman Length Scale as,\n(10),\nwhich is a generalization for the 3D case of the formulation for the Karman length scale from the classical boundary layer theory given by,\nU'\nU\"\n(11).\nThrough this length scale, the RANS k-w SST model can be modified in order to be a SAS model through the addition of the following production/destruction term to the transport equation of w:\n(12),\nwhere the constants are given by h2=3.51, sF 2/3, C=2 and the modeled or, in other words, non-solved turbulent scale is given by l = 4k I ( )) * ol) .\nThrough the Karman length scale, LVK, the turbulent structures resolvable by the local mesh size are identified and resolved. This is achieved by adding the source term given in Eq. (12) to the w equation resulting in lower values of turbulent viscosity in detached regions (recalling the definition or turbulent viscosity pt =pk/w). On the other hand, it is recognized that, even for very fine meshes, standard URANS models over- predict the turbulent viscosity in detached flow regions leading to the dissipation of vortex structures.\nDomain discretization and numerical solution\nAs can be seen in Maliska et al. (2012), the size of the computer domain was defined with a width of twelve (12) obstacle diameters (d), a height of three times the height of the obstacle, i.e. 12d, and a length of 36.2d. At the sides and ceiling boundaries the usual free slip wall condition was imposed. At the entrance a normal constant velocity equal to was imposed, and at the outlet region, an averaged pressure free flow (i.e., all velocity derivatives equal to zero) was used. The LES/SAS full hexahedral mesh was built based on the boundary layer thickness, which was estimated by the Blasius theory, and its value divided by 10 to determine the first cell size. Starting from the obstacle walls a growth factor of 1.05 was applied in all directions. The boundary layer estimated thickness for laminar flow for Re=11000 resulted in 5= 6x10-4m and the first cell size, therefore, was taken as 6x10-5m. This value resulted in a maximum y+~3, which was considered acceptable. The\nmesh used for the LES and SAS turbulence models is shown in figure 1, extracted from Maliska et al. (2012). A local refinement using an O-grid was defined near the obstacle, avoiding the usual \"reflection\" of structured meshes, allowing the generation of a likely constant grid spacing in the detached flow region, as recommended for LES models.\nFor the case where the unsteady k-o SST turbulence model has been used, the mesh is almost 4 times coarser, due to the fact that this model does not need to capture scales of the flow which are modeled in this formulation. The size of the mesh used in LES and SAS approaches was 7.5 million nodes and for the k-o SST model about 2 million nodes.\nNumerical computations were performed using the commercial package ANSYS CFX 13.0. This software is based on a discretization of the governing equations using an Element-based Finite Volume Method EbFVM (Baliga and Patankar, 1980) and a coupled approach for solving the pressure-velocity coupling (Raw, 1985). In all models, even for the RANS approach (k-o SST model), transient computations were developed considering the same time step, which was set to At = 5x10-6s. This value led to a maximum Courant number of about 3 for the LES Dynamic model. A high resolution interpolation function (Barth and Jespersen, 1989) was used for the\nk-o SST and a Central Differencing Scheme (CDS) was used for the LES simulations. For the SAS model, a blending between both of them was used, where the high resolution scheme is used in the URANS region and CDS is used elsewhere. More details about the simulation parameters can be seen in Maliska et al. (2012).\nResults and discussion\nProblem description\nThe test problem proposed by the organizing committee of the 2012 Conference of the CFD Society of Canada consists of the flow computation over a finite square cylinder with the side dimension d (d = 12.7mm) and height h (h = 4d = 50.4mm). The flow around the obstacle has a free stream velocity of 15 m/s with a turbulence intensity of approximately 0.8%. As stated, Reynolds number based on the side size (d) and free stream velocity (U^) is about 11000.\nThe obstacle is mounted vertically in an open-section wind tunnel (zero streamwise pressure gradient) at a distance of 4h from the leading edge of the plate. Figure 2, taken from Maliska etal. (2012), schematically shows\nthe obstacle and the dimensions of the problem. The lines where velocity and turbulent stresses were compared against experimental results are also shown in the figure. The computational wind tunnel has 12d of height, 13d of width, 200mm (15.7d) from the obstacle center to the inlet and 20d from the obstacle back face to the outlet.\nAveraged profiles\nVelocity profiles have been time-averaged for all three models and compared with transient averaged experimental values provided by the organizing committee of the 2012 Conference of the CFD Society of Canada. The results were compared along lines transversal to the flow direction (contained in a horizontal (y-x) plane located at half the height of the obstacle, as shown in figure 2.\nDimensionless average velocity profiles for U and V components obtained from the three models are shown in figure 3, reproduced from Maliska et a/.(2012).\nVelocity fluctuation correlations in the wake region are presented in figure 4, from Maliska et a/. (2012), for the LES and SAS simulations, compared to experimental data. A zoom clipping the LES approach results is included\nin the (u'v') profile for line x/d = 0.875 (i.e. very near downstream of the obstacle), in order to distinguish the SAS results. In this region, LES model seems to overpredict the experimental values for both u'RMS and (u'v'). This maybe is due to the lack of a sufficiently refined mesh in this region where turbulent scales are small and the mesh size relative to the turbulent scales does not satisfy the LES filtering criterion. On the other hand, the SAS model is able to deal with this by resolving the scales not captured by the grid through the RANS approach.\nFurther from the obstacle, both models adequately predict the velocity fluctuation correlations, though SAS results are closer to experimental values.\nFlow structure\nGrayscale maps of instantaneous and averaged velocity in a plane z=2 are presented in figure 5, from Maliska et a/. (2012). As expected, averaged velocity fields are similar for the three approaches considered in this paper. Nevertheless, it can be observed that the wake, as seen by the averaged fields is slightly wider for the SST model, due to the higher diffusivity introduced in URANS computations. In all cases, the fields were\nFigure 2 - Problem overview. Lines where profiles were compared are also shown. From Maliska et al. (2012).\nFigura 2 - Vis\u00e3o geral do problema.

(2012), where iso-surfaces of l2 (see, for instance, Chakraborty etal., 2005) calculated\nthrough the instantaneous and averaged velocity fields are shown for the SAS and LES models. The structures for the averaged flow are similar in both models, but some incoherent scales still appear in the LES case, indicating that a higher averaging time should be used. This is another issue in the LES approach. The higher\nFigure 4 - Velocity fluctuation correlations (along lines shown in figure 2). From Maliska et al.

It can be seen that the inclusion of the source term given in equation 12 into the o equation, increases the values of this variable and, indirectly, controls the production of k , damping the turbulent viscosity and so allowing the development of the vortex structures.\nFinal remarks\nThe results presented in Maliska et al. (2012) from calculations using three different turbulence modeling approaches were compared with experimental data measurements provided by the organizing committee of the 2012 Conference of the CFD Society of Canada. The two-equation k-o SST RANS model provided good\nagreement with experimental results when average quantities were compared, but, as expected, failed to present detailed three-dimensional wake structures.\nThe LES model also presented good comparisons with the measured data in terms of average quantities, but over-predicted the results for Reynolds stress components near the body walls. One explanation for this behavior could be that the mesh refinement in the near-wall region was insufficient as turbulence scales decrease at a high rate when approaching the wall. As the SAS \"filtering\" scale is LKV and not the mesh size, this model can deal adequately with turbulence damping near the wall, where it becomes a URANS model. The k-o SST-SAS turbulence model provided very good overall results and seems adequate to be used in industrial applications aiming at practical engineering results, particularly when transient wake-flow regions are to be solved. From the results presented in Maliska et al. (2012), it was concluded that although the SAS model CPU requirements were to the same order as LES, this was caused by the same time step used for both models. Higher timesteps were avoided because they led\nInstantaneous fields\nAveraged fields\nSST\tSAS\tLES\nFigure 6 -l iso-surfaces for SST, SAS and LES models. Instantaneous and averaged fields.

It would have been possible to use higher timesteps for the SAS simulation coupled with a less refined grid, substantially lowering the CPU requirements for the SAS model.\nAt the time of the 2012 Conference of the CFD Society of Canada, one detail was overlooked: the geometry proposed for the simulation challenge was a block with sharp corners. This feature means that separation lines were somewhat fixed, and the resulting wake structures were less influential for the calculation of integral quantities as drag and lift coefficients. The flow around bodies with rounded corners is in general more difficult to predict, and the circular cylinder is the extreme case: the curvilinear surface requires a very good solution of\nthe boundary layer in order to correctly predict the position of the separation lines.\nAfter these observations, it could be concluded that it would be interesting to evaluate thek-o SST-SAS model and the k-o SST-DES model aiming at the prediction of the flow around a bluff body with curvilinear surfaces. Although both are based on the same RANS model, it would be possible to compare the influence of the explicit mesh dependence inherent in the DES model with the implicit mesh dependence that is a feature of the SAS model. Simulations using both models for different mesh resolutions and different timesteps could lead to more definitive conclusions about the best choices for the economical simulation of the flow around bluff bodies, aiming at engineering results.\nRefer\u00eancias bibliogr\u00e1ficas\n\u25a0\tBALIGA, B.
