It comprises a collage of oceanic domains and \ncontinental fragments developed between 900 and 540\u00a0Ma between \nthe Rio de La Plata, Congo and Kalahari cratons. The\u00a0integration of \nfield and structural data with recent isotopic results has introduced \nnew insights on the sources of the magmatism and sedimentary \nprocesses. This paper presents a review of the geochronological re-\nsults combined with stratigraphic, structural and geochemical data. \nThe\u00a0 evolution of the Dom Feliciano Belt involved three orogenic \nevents known as the Passinho (0.89 \u2013 0.86 Ga), S\u00e3o Gabriel (0.77\u00a0\u2013 \n0.68 Ga) and Dom Feliciano (0.65 \u2013 0.54 Ga). The first two events \ninvolved the closure of the Charrua Ocean generating an intra-oce-\nanic arc (Passinho) and, subsequently, an active continental margin \narc (S\u00e3o Gabriel). This ocean separated the continental areas repre-\nsented by the Rio de la Plata Craton and the Nico Perez continental \nmicroplate. Closure of the Adamastor ocean resulted in an important \ncollisional event between the Nico Perez Microplate/Rio de La Plata \nCraton and Kalahari and Congo cratons between 650 and 620\u00a0Ma, \ninvolving high T/intermediate P metamorphism. At\u00a0 this time of \ncrustal thickening, the partition of the deformation controled the fi-\nnal evolution of the belt with important escape tectonics, responsible \nfor nucleating crustal-scale transcurrent shear zones. These structures \nwere deep and promoted the rise of mafic magmas, which, associated \nwith high regional thermal gradient, lead to an important event of \ncrustal reworking, responsible for the formation of the Pelotas Batho-\nlith. The orogenic collapse is represented by late magmatism of Pelo-\ntas Batholith and deposition of upper section of the Camaqu\u00e3 Basin.\nKEYWORDS: Rio de La Plata Craton; Nico Perez Microplate; \nDom Feliciano Belt; U-Pb Geochronology; Orogeny.\n\nRESUMO: O Cintur\u00e3o Dom Feliciano, que se estende desde o leste \ndo Uruguai at\u00e9 o sul do Brasil, representa um importante or\u00f3geno Neo-\nproterozoico formado pela colagem de dom\u00ednios oce\u00e2nicos e fragmentos \ncontinentais entre os cr\u00e1tons Rio de La Plata, Congo e Kalahari. A in-\ntegra\u00e7\u00e3o de dados de mapeamento geol\u00f3gico e estrutural com resultados \nisot\u00f3picos permitu estabelecer uma melhor compreens\u00e3o sobre as fontes \nde magmatismo e os processos de sedimenta\u00e7\u00e3o.

It comprises the Dom Feliciano (Uruguay \nand\u00a0southern Brazil), Ribeira (Paran\u00e1, S\u00e3o Paulo, Minas \nGerais\u00a0and Rio de Janeiro states) and Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed belts (Esp\u00edrito \nSanto, eastern Minas Gerais and southern Bahia states) \n(e.g.: Heilbron &amp; Machado 2003). Its African counterpart \nincludes the Saldania-Gariep, Damara, Kaoko and West \nCongo belts (Fig.\u00a01). Several models have been presented \nto explain the tectonic evolution of this orogen and its role \nin the assemby of West Gondwana (e.g.: Chemale 2000, \nCordani et\u00a0al. 2003, Basei et\u00a0al. 2008). The Mantiqueira \nProvince is a NE-SW mobile belt running parallel to the \nsouthern and eastern coast of Brazil extending for more than \n3,000\u00a0km from Bahia to Uruguay. \n\nThe Dom Feliciano Belt (DFB) formed during a long-\nlived evolution of ca.\u00a0450\u00a0My, starting with the opening of the \nCharrua Ocean in the southwestern portion of Gondwana, \nat 950 \u2013 900\u00a0Ma. The closure of this ocean and the colli-\nsion of magmatic arcs occured between 770 and 680\u00a0Ma. \nThis was followed by the closure of the Adamastor Ocean \nand the collision between the Nico Perez Microplate/Rio de \nLa Plata Craton and the Kalahari Craton at the end of the \nNeoproterozoic. Three distinct events may be recognized:\n1. the development of the Passinho Arc,\n2. the development of the S\u00e3o Gabriel Arc, and\n3. the formation of the Dom Feliciano Arc (Chemale Jr. \n\net\u00a0al. 1995, Chemale Jr. 2000, Saalmann et\u00a0al. 2010).\n\nIn this paper, we present a review of the data on the DFB \ngeological evolution, in particular the new U-Pb geochronolog-\nical data on igneous and metamorphic rocks and sedimentary \n\nNeoproterozoic to Paleozoic\nOrogenic Belts\n\nPre-Brazilian/Pan African\n\nStudy area\n\nA Ara\u00e7uai D Damara\nDF Dom Feliciano\n\nWC West Congo\nS Saldania\nR Ribeira\n\nK Kaoko\nG Gariep\n\nB Bras\u00edlia\n\nPan-African/Brazilian Belts (West Gondwana)\n\n2.000 km0\n\nPorto Alegre\n\n1.000 km\n\nBRAZIL\n\nFigure 1.

The\u00a0pres-\nent compilation includes, therefore, a historical review, starting \nwith the pioneer Rb-Sr studies (Silva Filho 1984, Soliani Jr. \n1986), and passing to the use of Pb-Pb and ID-TIMS U-Pb \nsystematics (Machado et\u00a0al. 1990, Babinski et\u00a0al. 1996, 1997). \nMore recently, the widespread use of the SHRIMP (Silva et\u00a0al. \n1997, 2000; Leite et\u00a0al. 1998, 2000; Hartmann et\u00a0al. 1999, \n2000) and LA-ICP-MS techniques has produced abundant \nnew isotopic data allowing significant progress to the under-\nstanding of tectonic processes in southern Brazil.\n\nMETHODS\n\nThis work is based mainly on a review of U-P and \nPb-Pb zircon geochronology available for the Precambrian \n\nterrains in southern Brazil. To assess the sources of mag-\nmas we used Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd and some Lu-Hf and ?18O \ndata. The interpretation of geochronological and iso-\ntopic data was then combined with a review of field \ngeological data produced by various regional geological \nmapping projects.\n\nThe magmatic crystallization ages are more abundant \nand were predominantly obtained by the Rb-Sr, U-Pb \nSHRIMP and LA-ICPMS methods. Metamoprhic ages \nwere obtained by dating of zircon and titanite by U-Pb \nmethod, of whole rock and mineral by Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd and \nAr-Ar isotope methods, and of monazite from metapelites \nby EMPA. The U-Pb zircon data also include provenance \nstudies of metavolcano-sedimentary complexes, includ-\ning a total of 1,338 zircon grains analysed, of which 662 \nremain unpublished.

The geology of this \narea consists of fragments of the Nico Perez Terrane (Oyhant\u00e7abal \net\u00a0al. 2011; Rapela et\u00a0al. 2011) composed of Paleoproterozoic, \nMesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic metamorphic and granitic \nrocks, surrounded by Neoproterozoic associations of the DFB (Fig.\u00a01).\n\nThe DFB is the southern segment of the Mantiqueira \nProvince, and represents a crustal segment strongly deformed \nand migmatized between ca. 650 and 620\u00a0Ma (eg.: Fernandes \net\u00a0al. 1992, Chemale et\u00a0al. 1995, Basei et\u00a0al. 2011, Bitencourt \n&amp; Nardi 2000, Philipp &amp; Machado 2005, Saalmann et\u00a0al. \n2005, 2006, 2010, Philipp et\u00a0al. 2013, 2016a, Hartmann \net\u00a0al. 1999, 2000, 2011, Chemale Jr. et\u00a0al. 2012). Remnants \nof older continental crust are represented by septa exposed \nin Santa Catarina (Hartmann et\u00a0al. 2000, Basei et\u00a0al. 2008), \nRio Grande do Sul (Philipp &amp; Machado, 2005, Philipp \net al. 2008, Hartmann\u00a0et\u00a0al. 2008, 2011), and Uruguay \n(Hartmann et\u00a0al. 2002, Oyhant\u00e7abal et\u00a0al. 2011). \n\nThe DFB is divided from west to east in:\n1. S\u00e3o Gabriel Terrane,\n2. Tijucas Terrane,\n3. Florian\u00f3polis-Pelotas-Aigua batholiths,\n\n4. Rocha and Punta del Este terranes (Fig. 3).\n\nThe belt comprises rock units developed during three major \norogenic events: the Passinho (890 \u2013 860\u00a0Ma), S\u00e3o Gabriel \n(770 \u2013 680\u00a0Ma) and the Dom Feliciano (650\u00a0\u2013 540\u00a0Ma) (e.g.: \nChemale Jr. 2000, Hartmann et\u00a0al. 2007, Saalmann\u00a0et\u00a0al.\u00a02010, \nPhilipp et al. 2014). \n\nThe relationships between the units of Rio de La Plata \nCraton (RLPC), Nico Perez Microplate (NPM) and Dom \nFeliciano Belt (DFB) are shown in Figure 2, in which a combi-\nnation of information including the time relationships between \nlithostratigraphic and geotectonic units and time, U-Pb and \nPb-Pb geochronology (crystallization, metamorphic ages and \ndetrital zircon provenance in metasediments), geochemistry, \nand main orogenic cycles are presented. The geochronologi-\ncal data indicate three main Neoproterozoic orogenic events:\n1. initial crustal accretion phase with juvenile magmatism, \n\nbetween ca. 890 and 860,\n2. continental arc magmatism and accretion between 770 \n\nand 680\u00a0Ma, and\n3. collisional metamorphism between 650 and 620 Ma and \n\na main magmatic phase between ca. 650 and 550\u00a0Ma, \nwith intense crustal anatexis promoted by the injection \nof mantle magmas.\n\n150 km\n\nA B\n\nPhanerozoic Cover\n\nRIO DE LA PLATA/LUIS ALVES CRATON\n\nDOM FELICIANO BELT\n\nNICO PEREZ MICROPLATE\n\nArchean/Paleoproterozoic Terrane\n(A = Piedra Alta, B = Luis Alves)\n\nPaleoproterozoic Terranes\n(c = Taquaremb\u00f3, d = Riviera, e = Valentines)\n\nPaleoproterozoic, Meso and\nNeoproterozoic Deformed units\n\nTijucas Terrane (2.35 \u2013 0.78 Ga)\n\nPunta del Este Terrane (1.1 \u2013 0.54 Ga)\n\nRocha Terrane\nS\u00e3o Gabriel Terrane (0.95 \u2013 0.68 Ga)\n\nGranitic Batholiths (FB=Florian\u00f3polis,\nPB=Pelotas) (0.65 \u2013 0.54)\n\nPost-Collisional Basin (0.6 \u2013 0.54 Ga)\n\nN\na\n\nb\n\nAB\n\nFigure 3.

The\u00a0Paleoproterozoic rocks comprise associations \nformed in three main events:\n1. the Santa Maria Chico (Siderian, 2.4-2.35 Ga),\n2. the Encantadas (Rhyacian, 2.2\u20132.0\u00a0Ga), and\n3. the Seival event (Statherian 1.8\u20131.7 Ga).\n\nAfter that, the continental crust in southern Brazil \nexperienced a period of tectonic quiescence which was \nmarked by the emplacement of basic-ultrabasic complexes \nof Callymian age (1.57\u20131.55 Ga), represented by the \nCapivarita  meta-anortosite (Chemale Jr. et\u00a0al. 2011) and \nby the Tupi Silveira Amphibolite (Camozzato et\u00a0al. 2013). \n\nThe Taquaremb\u00f3 Terrane (TT) is located in the southwest-\nern portion of the shield and represents the largest exposed \nfragment of the Nico Perez Terrane (Fig.\u00a04). The\u00a0TT comprises \nthe Paleoproterozoic Santa Maria Chico Granulitic Complex \nwhich is intruded by Neoproterozoic granites and covered by \nthe volcano-sedimentary sequence of the Camaqu\u00e3 Basin. \n\nGEOTECTONIC UNITS OF \nTHE DOM FELICIANO BELT\n\nS\u00e3o Gabriel Terrane \nThe S\u00e3o Gabriel Terrane (SGT) forms the western portion \n\nof the DFB and has an elongated shape in the N20\u00a0\u2013 30\u00b0E \ndirection, underlying an area of approximately 110\u00a0x\u00a060\u00a0km \n(Fig.\u00a03). This region is covered in the west and north by \nthe Phanerozoic units of the Paran\u00e1 Basin, and is limited \nto the south by the N70W \u2013 S70oE trending Ibar\u00e9 Shear \nZone\u00a0(ISZ) and to the east by the Ca\u00e7apava do Sul Shear \nZone (CSSZ). Geophysical modelling of the Ca\u00e7apava do \nSul lineament shows that this structure is deep-seated and \nmay be interpreted as the suture zone between the S\u00e3o \nGabriel and Tijucas terranes (Chemale Jr. 2000 and ref-\nerences therein). The SGT consists of remanents of ophi-\nolitic complexes and three Neoproterozoic magmatic arcs; \nthe older is an intraoceanic arc (Passinho), and the younger \nrepresent active continental margins (S\u00e3o Gabriel and Dom \nFeliciano) (Fig.\u00a03).\n\nThe units of the SGT are strongly controlled by N30 \u2013 \n40oE trending shear zones, which are rotated to the N70oW \ndirection by the Ibar\u00e9 Shear Zone (ISZ) in the southern \nlimit of the terrane. This tectonic linear structure is easily \nrecognized by magnetic anomalies, as well by the elliptical \n\nshape of the plutonic bodies of the Neoproterozoic Seival \nAssociation.\n\nThe different rock units of the SGT may be grouped \ninto three main petrotectonic associations:\n1. the Palma Accretionary Prism,\n2. Arc-related Associations and\n3. the Seival volcano-sedimentary-plutonic association \n\n(Fig.\u00a05).\n\nThe Palma Accretionary Prism is made of tectonic slabs \nof ophiolitic complexes, comprising magnesian schist, ser-\npentinite and amphibolite, with subordinate metaperidot-\nite, metagabbro and metapyroxenite. The Arc Association is \ncomposed of the Passinho and S\u00e3o Gabriel arc rocks, rep-\nresented by metavolcano-sedimentary associations formed \nbetween ca. 0.89 and 0.68 Ga (Machado\u00a0 et\u00a0 al. 1990, \nBabinski et\u00a0al. 1996,\u00a0Leite et\u00a0al. 1998, Remus et\u00a0al.\u00a01999, \nHartmann et\u00a0al.\u00a02011, Lena et\u00a0al. 2014, Philipp et\u00a0al. 2014). \nThe Pontas do Salso Complex is a late-orogenic arc-related \nbasin, younger than 0.68 Ga and part of the S\u00e3o Gabriel \nTerrane (Vedana et\u00a0al. 2016). These associations are in \ntectonic contact with passive margin metasedimentary \nassociation represented by the Passo Feio and Marmeleiro \ncomplexes. The Seival volcano-sedimentary-plutonic asso-\nciation formed between 0.61 and 0.54\u00a0Ga, representing the \nlate to post-orogenic stages of the Dom Feliciano Orogeny \n(Chemale Jr., 2000).\n\nPalma Accretionary Prism\n\nOphiolitic Complexes \nThe mafic-ultramafic complexes comprise amphibolite \n\nand metaultramafic rocks including serpentinized harzburg-\nite, metapyroxenite, metagabbro, serpentinite and Mg-rich \nschist with tholeiitic signature (Leite et\u00a0al. 1998; Remus et\u00a0al. \n1999; Chemale Jr. 2000). Five major ophiolite complexes, \nPalma, Passo do Ivo, Cerro Mantiqueira, Cambaizinho and \nArroio Lajeadinho occur elongated bodies parallel to regional \nstructures (Figs.\u00a05 and 6).\n\nThe metaultramafic rocks present M1 assemblage comprising \nantophilite+forsterite+enstatite, defining conditions of medium \nto high grade with low pressure (Leite et\u00a0al. 1998, Chemale Jr. \n2000). Younger metamorphic events were accompanied by the \nformation of ductile shear zones which characterize the later \nregional deformation and mark the M2 greenschist facies meta-\nmorphism. The authors interpreted the amphibolite metamor-\nphism (M1) and the late greenschist facies event\u00a0(M2) as related \nto the S\u00e3o Gabriel and Dom Feliciano events, respectively.

To\u00a0the east, these units are \ncovered by the sedimentary rocks of the Maric\u00e1 Formation \nof the Camaqu\u00e3 Basin.\n\nThe regional metamorphism of the Imbicu\u00ed Complex is \nmarked by the assemblage plagioclase + hornblende + biotite \nand plagioclase + hornblende + diopside, indicative of P-T \nconditions of the mid-to upper amphibolite facies, with low \npressure. A retrograde metamorphic event is marked by a \ngreenschist to lower amphibolite paragenesis formed of albite \n+ actinolite/hornblende + chlorite + epidote + white mica.\n\nS\u00e3o Gabriel Arc\nRocks of the S\u00e3o Gabriel Arc are exposed in a large area \n\nextending from S\u00e3o Gabriel, Vila Nova do Sul and S\u00e3o Sep\u00e9, \nin the west, to Lavras do Sul, in the south (Fig.\u00a05). The S\u00e3o \nGabriel Arc consists of metavolcano-sedimentary rocks of the \nBossoroca Complex, orthogneiss and metagranitic rocks of \nthe\u00a0Camba\u00ed Complex, late- to post-collisional granites and dio-\nrites of the Lagoa da Meia Lua Suite, and mafic to ultramafic \nrocks of the Mata Grande Complex. These rocks are interlayered \nwith the\u00a0ophiolitic complexes and with metasedimentary rocks \nof\u00a0the Cambaizinho and Passo Feio complexes, and are covered \nby the metasedimentary rocks of the Pontas do Salso Complex.\n\nMetavolcanic Rocks\nThe Bossoroca Complex consists of Neoproterozoic \n\nmetavolcano-sedimentary rocks including acid to interme-\ndiate metatuffs and metalapilli tuffs and lava flows (metad-\nacites, meta-andesites and metabasalts), which are associated \nwith metapelitic, carbonaceous and chemical metasediments \n(Machado et\u00a0al. 1990, Remus et\u00a0al. 1999; Gubert et\u00a0al. 2016). \nMetavolcanoclastic rocks, pillowed metabasalts, amphibole \nschists and amphibolites exposed in the western part of the \nPasso Feio Complex may be correlated with the metavolcanic \nassociations of the Bossoroca Complex, according to the exist-\ning petrographic and geochemical data. The metavolcanic rocks \nhave low- to medium-K calc-alkaline composition. Machado \net\u00a0al. (1990) reported the TIMS U-Pb age of ca. 753\u00a0Ma for \na metadacite, which is identical to the U-Pb SHRIMP age \nof 756 \u00b1 14\u00a0Ma reported by Remus et\u00a0al. (1999) and U-Pb \nLA-ICP-MS of 767 \u00b1 3\u00a0Ma and 765 \u00b1 10\u00a0Ma reported by \nGubert et\u00a0al. (2016). Remus et\u00a0al. (1999) and Hartmann et\u00a0al. \n(2011) obtained ages of ca. 700\u00a0Ma for the metamorphic event \nthat affected this sequence. \n\nMetagranitic Rocks \nThe Camba\u00ed Complex (CC) is composed of two magmatic \n\nassociations: (i) tonalitic, trondhjemitic and dioritic gneiss, and \n(ii) intrusive metatonalites, metagranodiorites and metadiorites \n\n(Fig.\u00a07). The paragneisses of the Cambaizinho Complex are either \ninterlayered with or occur as xenoliths in the CC. Rocks of the \nCC are metaluminous, have mid- to high-K calc-alkaline chem-\nical composition and are cut by undeformed intrusions of the \nLagoa da Meia Lua Suite (Hartmann et\u00a0al. 2011). The Camba\u00ed \ngneisses yielded U-Pb SHRIMP and LA-ICP-MS zircon ages \nof ca. 740 and 720\u00a0Ma, interpreted by Hartmann et\u00a0al. (2011) \nand Vedana et\u00a0al. (2016) as the age of igneous crystallization. \nU-Pb SHRIMP zircon ages of slightly deformed tonalites and \ndiorites of the CC are between ca. 710 and 690\u00a0Ma (Babinski \net\u00a0al. 1996, Hartmann et\u00a0al. 2011), and those reported for \ntonalites and diorites in the Lavras do Sul region are in the \nrange between 740 and 720\u00a0Ma (Leite et\u00a0al. 1998, Lusa et\u00a0al. \n2016). Rocks\u00a0of the CC present positive initial ?Nd values and \nlow initial 86Sr/87Sr ratios (Saalmann et\u00a0al. 2005), indicating \njuvenile nature of the original magmas (Babinski et\u00a0al. 1996). \n\nThe Lagoa da Meia Lua Suite (LMLS) is made of \ntonalite-granodiorite to diorite forming N20 \u2013 30oE elon-\ngated bodies, concordant with the main ductile shear zones \nof\u00a0the SGT. This suite includes the youngest magmatic \nrocks of the S\u00e3o Gabriel orogen and is intrusive into the \nCambaizinho and Camba\u00ed complexes (Fig.\u00a07). The LMLS \nrepresents a late to post-orogenic intrusive event, including \nthe Capivara Diorite, the Sanga do Jobim Granodiorite, the \nCerca de Pedra Granodiorite and the Buriti Tonalite (Garavaglia \net al., 2002 Hartmann et\u00a0al. 2011 and references therein). \nThe SHRIMP U-Pb zircon ages indicate that the granitoid \nemplacement occurred between 700 and 680\u00a0Ma, including \nages of 703\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\u00a0Ma for the Buriti Tonalite, 704 \u00b1 3\u00a0Ma for \nthe Santa Z\u00e9lia Granite, 690 \u00b1 2\u00a0Ma for the BR-290 tonalite, \n694 \u00b1 5\u00a0Ma for the BR-290 trondhjemite, 682 \u00b1 2\u00a0Ma for the \nCerca de Pedra Granodiorite, and 680 \u00b1 2\u00a0Ma for the Sanga \ndo Jobim Granodiorite (Hartmann et\u00a0al. 2011).\n\nThe Mata Grande and the Pedra Pretas complexes are \nthe two main mafic plutonic bodies of the Lagoa da Meia \nLua Suite. The Mata Grande is a layered intrusion com-\nposed by gabbro-peridotite and other cumulate rock units \ndated by LA-ICPMS U-Pb zircon method at 668 \u00b1 3\u00a0Ma \n(Sim\u00f5es et\u00a0al. 2014). \n\nThe metasedimentary rocks of the Pontas do Salso Complex \nare exposed in the southeastern portion of the SGT. Meta-\narkoses are dominant, with subordinate lenses of conglomer-\natic meta-arkoses and phyllites. The metaconglomerates and \nmeta-sandstones are immature with clasts of metavolcanic and \ngranitic rocks with andesitic to dacitic composition and medi-\num-K calc-alkaline affinity (Vedana et\u00a0al. 2016). Petrographic \nand geochemical data indicate that the sources of the \nmetasedimentary rocks were metavolcanic and metagranitic \nrocks of the Passinho and S\u00e3o Gabriel arcs. LA-ICP-MS detri-\ntal zircon provenance data for a meta-arkoses and muscovite \nphyllite indicated that the sources of the complex have ages \n\n91\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 46(Suppl 1): 83-104, June 2016\n\nRuy Paulo Philipp et al.\n\n\n\nbetween 900 and 680\u00a0Ma (Vedana et\u00a0al. 2016). The youngest \nages suggest that the complex represents a late- to post-oro-\ngenic basin and the collapse of the S\u00e3o Gabriel Arc.\n\nMetasedimentary Complexes \nThe Cambaizinho and Passo Feio complexes together \n\nwith the ophiolitic rocks are the oldest units of the SGT. \nBoth supracrustal units occur as km-long elongated strips, \nas well as metric-decametric xenoliths and roof pendants, \nin the Camba\u00ed Complex metagranitoids and in the granites \nof the LMLS (Hartmann et\u00a0al. 2011). \n\nThe Cambaizinho Complex (CbC) (Lena et\u00a0al. 2014) com-\nprises metapelitic gneisses with intercalations of calc-silicate \nrocks, marbles and impure quartzite. Metamorphic paragen-\nesis as biotite + garnet + staurolite and plagioclase + quartz + \ndiopside + grossular indicates metamorphism in mid- to upper \namphibolite facies conditions. Sm-Nd isotope data presented \nby Saalmann et\u00a0al. (2005) indicate that the original sediments of \nthe Cambaizinho Complex derived from the erosion of juvenile \nrocks of the Passinho and S\u00e3o Gabriel arcs. Lena et\u00a0al. (2014) \n\npresented the results of combined SHRIMP and LA-ICP-MS \nU-Pb ages of detrital zircon grains from the metasedimentary \nrocks of the Cambaizinho Complex. Igneous ages range from \n840 to 700\u00a0Ma, with a peak around 750 and 700\u00a0Ma, suggest-\ning that the tectonic setting of the original sediments was part \nof a fore-arc or back-arc basin. The ?18O values of the detrital \nzircon varied from +3.2 to +9.6% and are grouped into three \ndistinct groups of sediment sources. They point to a progres-\nsive evolution of the S\u00e3o Gabriel Terrane from an intraoceanic \narc to a continental active margin.\n\nThe Passo Feio Complex (PFC) is exposed in the eastern \npart of the SGT and was defined as a sequence of metapelite, \nmarble, calc-silicate rocks and quartzite, intercalated with \namphibolite, metavolcanic/metavolcanoclastic rocks and \nmagnesium schist (Figs.\u00a03 and 5). The U-Pb SHRIMP \nzircon provenance work was carried out by Remus et\u00a0al. \n(2000) in one sample from the northwestern part of the \nPFC, and show zircon grains ranging in age from Archean \nto Neoproterozoic.

It is in tectonic contact with the SGT to the west \nalong the Ca\u00e7apava do Sul Shear Zone. The eastern boundary, \nwith the Pelotas Batholith, is marked by the strike-slip Dorsal do \nCangu\u00e7u Shear Zone (e.g.: Fernandes et\u00a0al. 1992, Philipp et\u00a0al. \n2003). The northeastern contact of the TjT with the Pelotas \nBatholith is affected by the Passo do Marinheiro Shear Zone. \n\nThe TjT consists of:\n1. a basement inlier made of Paleoproterozoic orthogneis-\n\nses of the Encantadas and Vigia complexes,\n2. Statherian Seival Metagranite,\n3. Calymminian Tupi Silveira Amphibolite, and\n4. Neoproterozoic metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks \n\nof the Porongos Complex (Saalmann et\u00a0al. 2005) (Fig.\u00a08).\n\nBasement orthogneisses are exposed in the core of large-\nscale antiforms known as the Santana da Boa Vista Dome \nand as the Vigia Dome in the Hulha Negra region (Fig.\u00a09).\n\nBasement Domes \nThe Santana da Boa Vista and Vigia Domes are surrounded \n\nby metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks of the Porongos \nComplex. The contact between the complexes is represented \nby a low-angle ductile shear zone marked by mylonites which \nobliterate the original stratigraphic relationships.\n\nEncantadas Complex \nThe Encantadas Complex (EC) is a Paleoproterozoic \n\n(Siderian and Rhyacian) unit composed of dioritic, tonalitic \nand trondhjemitic gneisses with minor amphibolite and \nhornblende-rich metaultramafic rocks, where gneisses are \nmetaluminous to slightly peraluminous, with medium-K \ncalc-alkaline nature, representing a typical high-Al TTG \nassociation (Philipp et\u00a0al. 2008, 2016b) (Fig.\u00a08). This meta-\nmorphic complex is intruded by Rhyacian mylonitic monzo- \nand syenogranitic gneisses (Philipp et\u00a0al. 2008, 2016b).\n\nThe EC tonalitic gneisses have SHRIMP U-Pb crystal-\nlization zircon ages of 2.340\u00a0Ma, whereas intrusive monzo-\ngranitic to syenogranitic mylonitic gneisses present Rhyacian \nLA-ICP-MS U-Pb ages of 2.211 \u00b1 17\u00a0Ma and 2.210 \u00b1 16\u00a0Ma \n(Philipp et\u00a0al. 2016b). The gneiss was metamorphosed under \nupper amphibolite facies conditions during the Orosirian \n(2.040 \u00b1 10\u00a0Ma and 2.020 \u00b1 11\u00a0Ma) (Hartmann et\u00a0al. 2003). \nZircon grains from the EC orthogneiss in the Hulha Negra and \n\nCandiota regions display two LA-ICP-MS U-Pb age popula-\ntions: (i)\u00a0Siderian ages of ca 2.40 to 2.35\u00a0Ga and (ii) Rhyacian \nages, with values of ca 2.23 Ga to 2.15\u00a0Ga (Camozzato et\u00a0al. \n2013). In the Vigia Dome region, in Hulha Negra, the EC \northogneisses are intruded by the Seival Metagranite and by \ntheTupi Silveira Amphibolite. The tonalitic gneisses of the EC \nhave U-Pb crystallization ages of 2.112 \u00b1 22\u00a0Ma and 2.153\u00a0\u00b1 \n20\u00a0Ma, as well as a concordia age of 643 \u00b113\u00a0Ma for meta-\nmorphic zircon grains (Camozzato et\u00a0al. 2013). \n\nVigia Complex\nThe Vigia Complex (VC) is a Paleoproterozoic (Rhyacian) \n\nunit composed of dioritic, tonalitic and trondhjemitic gneisses \nwith minor amphibolite exposed at the southern portion of the \nTijucas Terrane (Camozzato et\u00a0al. 2013) (Fig.\u00a08). This\u00a0metamor-\nphic complex is intruded by the Seival Metagranite, an elongate \nNE-SW pluton of Sthaterian age that intrudes the VC in the \nsoutheastern portion of the Vigia Dome (Fig.\u00a09). Geochemical \ndata indicate that the VC gneisses are metaluminous to slightly \nperaluminous, with medium to high-K calc-alkaline nature, char-\nacterizing a high-Al TTG association (Camozzato et\u00a0al. 2013). \n\nThe VC tonalitic gneisses have LA-ICP-MS crystal-\nlization zircon ages of 2.05 \u2013 2.04 Ga (Camozzato et\u00a0al. \n2013). In the Vigia Dome region, in Hulha Negra, the VC \northogneisses are intruded by the Seival Metagranite and \nby theTupi Silveira Amphibolite. \n\nSeival Metagranite \nThe Seival Metagranite (SM) is a 40 x 10 km pluton elon-\n\ngated in the N30oE direction, intrusive into the VC gneiss in \nthe southeastern portion of the Vigia Dome (Fig.\u00a09). The\u00a0meta-\ngranite has a monzogranite to granodiorite composition and \npresent equigranular texture made of K-feldspar, plagioclase, \nquartz and biotite (&lt;5%). Geochemical data indicate high-K \ncalc-alkaline composition, with metaluminous to slightly per-\naluminous nature, and trace element characteristics similar \nto those of evolved arc-related associations (Camozzato et\u00a0al. \n2013). Three samples of the SM were dated and yielded U-Pb \nLA-ICP-MS ages of 1.785 \u00b1 42\u00a0Ma, 1.768 \u00b1 24\u00a0Ma and 1.764\u00a0\u00b1 \n29\u00a0Ma, revealing, therefore, a previously unknown Statherian \ngranitic magmatism in southern Brazil (Camozzato et\u00a0al. 2013).\n\nTupi Silveira Amphibolite \nThe Tupi Silveira Amphibolite (TSA) crops out in the \n\nsouthern portion of the Vigia Dome, comprising two bod-\nies about 1 \u2013 2 km in length, elongated in the N10oE and \nN30oE directions (Fig. 9). The bodies are intrusive into the VC \ngneisses, although direct contact relationships have not been \nobserved. The amphibolites present a regular and continuous \nbanding of milimetric thickness and polygonal granoblastic \ntexture defined by plagioclase, hornblende, garnet and rare \n\n93\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 46(Suppl 1): 83-104, June 2016\n\nRuy Paulo Philipp et al.\n\n\n\nD\nO\n\nM\n F\n\nE\nL\n\nIC\nIA\n\nN\nO\n\nE\nV\n\nE\nN\n\nT\nC\n\nA\nPA\n\nN\nE\n\n E\nV\n\nE\nN\n\nT\nS\u00c3\n\nO\n G\n\nA\nB\n\nR\nIE\n\nL\nE\n\nV\nE\n\nN\nT\n\nR\nH\n\nYA\nC\n\nIA\nN\n\n E\nV\n\nE\nN\n\nT\n\nPORONGOS COMPLEX (0.80-0.65 Ga)\n\nSEDIMENTARY AND GRANITIC ROCKS (650 \u2013 540 Ma)\n\nCapan\u00e9 Antiform\n\nEncantadas Gneisses\n\n30\u00b030\u2019\n\n30\u00b000\u2019\n\n52\u00b045\u2019W\n\n31\u00b030\u2019S\n\n53\u00b015\u2019W\n\n53\u00b030\u2019W\n\n12 km\n\nMAIN STRUCTURES\n\nAntiform axis\n\nFault\n\nMylonitic rocks\n\nTranscurrent Faults\n\nThrust Shear Zone\n\nD = Serra do Godinho Antiform\n\nC = Canap\u00e9 Antiform\n\nB = Serra dos Pedrosas Antiform\n\nA = Santana da Boa Vista Dome\n\nMylonitic Granites\n\nENCANTADAS COMPLEX (2.2-2.0 Ga)\n\nMetaultramafic\nrocks\n\nQuartzite lenses\n\nMarble lenses\n\nMetapelites\n\nAcid to intermidiate metavolcanic rocks\n(800 \u2013 770 Ma)\n\nSantana da Boa Vista and other areas\n\nCapan\u00e9 metagranit\u00f3ids\n(600\u00b16 Ma)\n\nMetavolcanics\n(600 \u2013 580 Ma)\n\nMetapelites, quartzites and metaultramafites\n\nGranitic rocks of Dom Feliciano Event (650 \u2013 550 Ma)\n\nLate to post-orogenic sedimentary rocks (600 \u2013 540 Ma)\n\nPhanerozoic Cover\n\nFigure 8.

Recent \nstudies in the Cachoeira do Sul region, northern part of the \ncomplex, indicate that the rocks in this sector derived from \nNeoproterozoic sources (Gruber et\u00a0al. 2011, Pertile et\u00a0al. \n2015a,b). LA-ICP-MS U-Pb detrital zircon ages between \n850 and 700\u00a0Ma suggest that this part of the basin represents \na back-arc or a foreland basin. New SHRIMP U-Pb analy-\nses of metadacites and meta-andesites of the Santana da Boa \nVista and of metarhyolites of the Piratini region gave age \nvalues of 798 \u00b1 6\u00a0Ma, 801 \u00b1 5\u00a0Ma, 807 \u00b1 7\u00a0Ma and 803 \u00b1 \n4\u00a0Ma to Cerro da \u00c1rvore metadacites (unpublished data). \n\nTwo groups of granite intrusions in the PC are recognized:\n1. peraluminous granites with muscovite, garnet and tour-\n\nmaline and\n2. alkaline leucogranites with Fe-rich biotite and/or sodic \n\npyroxene (Capan\u00e9 and Candiotinha type metagranite).\n\nThese granites are deformed and emplaced along the S2 \nregional foliation. The compositional and textural characteris-\ntics were highlighted by Camozzato et\u00a0al. (2012) who correlated \nthe pearluminous granites with the intrusions of the Cordilheira \nSuite. U-Pb LA-ICP-MS data on zircon indicate crystallization at \n589 \u00b1 25\u00a0Ma for the Candiotinha Metagranite (Camozzato et\u00a0al. \n2013) and 601 \u00b1 7\u00a0Ma for the Capan\u00e9 Metagranite (unpublished \ndata). The ages obtained on the overgrowths of zircon crystals \nand titanite indicates metamorphism at ca. 540\u00a0Ma. \n\nPelotas Batholith\nThe Pelotas Batholith is composed of a set of Neoproterozoic \n\n(Ediacaran) granitic suites, generated during and after the \nclimax of the Dom Feliciano orogeny. The granitic suites are \nelongated in the N50 \u2013 70oE direction, and their genera-\ntion and emplacement were controlled by high angle ductile \ntranscurrent shear zones. The batholith is a multi-intrusive \n400 x 120\u00a0km plutonic complex including granite, gab-\nbro and diorite, as well as rhyolitic to basaltic dikes swarms \n(Fig.\u00a010) (Philipp &amp; Machado 2005). The granitoids repre-\nsent an early generation of high-K calc-alkaline suites with \nmetaluminous to peraluminous affinity, followed by alka-\nline magmatism and, finally, less voluminous peralkaline \nintrusions (Philipp &amp; Machado 2005, Oliveira et\u00a0al. 2015). \nShear zones in the batholith are defined by mylonitic belts \nwith sub-vertical foliation, accompanied by sub-hori-\nzontal stretching lineation, and were active during the \ndevelopment of the batholith, controlling the intrusion of \nthe granitic suites (Fig.\u00a010) (Fernandes et\u00a0al. 1992, Koester \net\u00a0al. 2001b, Philipp et\u00a0al. 2003). Syn-collisional episodes \n\nof compressional ductile movements were followed by an \nextensional post-collisional period.\n\nThe emplacement of the different intrusions took place \nbetween 650 and 550\u00a0Ma, but only a small proportion of the \ngranite plutons have been precisely dated. The available Sr and \nNd isotopic data suggest reworking of Paleoproterozoic conti-\nnental crust (Philipp et\u00a0al. 2003, 2007). The oldest unit of the \nbatholith is the Quit\u00e9ria Granite, followed by the Cordilheira \nSuite, Pinheiro Machado Complex, and the Viam\u00e3o, Erval, \nPiquiri, Encruzilhada do Sul, Dom Feliciano and the Itapu\u00e3 \nsuites (Koester et\u00a0al. 2001a,b, Frantz et al. 2003, Philipp et\u00a0al. \n2002, 2003, 2013). Despite the fact that diorites are com-\nmonly associated with the granitoids, Sr and Nd isotope data \nindicate a common trend of high 87Sr/86Sr initial ratios and \nnegative ?Nd values. The Sm-Nd (TDM) model ages are in the \ninterval between 1.100 and 2.100\u00a0Ma, supporting, therefore, \norigin of the granitic melts by anatexis of older crustal rocks \n(Koester et\u00a0al. 2001b, Philipp et\u00a0al. 2003, 2013, 2016a).\n\nGranitic Suites \nThe Quit\u00e9ria Metagranite is the oldest granite in the batho-\n\nlith, with a U-Pb SHRIMP zircon age of 658 \u00b1 4\u00a0Ma (Frantz \net\u00a0al. 2003). In the Quit\u00e9ria region, the peraluminous granites of \nthe Cordilheira Suite have U-Pb SHRIMP zircon ages between \nca. 634 and 625 \u00b1 6\u00a0Ma (Cordilheira and Francisquinho gran-\nites) and 605 \u00b1 8\u00a0Ma (Figueiras granite) (Frantz et\u00a0al. 2003). \nNew\u00a0LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon ages of peraluminous leucogranite \nin migmatitic pelitic gneiss of\u00a0the Varzea do Capivarita Complex \nindicate crystallization at 620 \u00b1 6\u00a0Ma, whereas metamorphic \nzircon grains of the migmatitic gneisses have the age of 619\u00a0\u00b1 \n5\u00a0Ma. This indicates that the granitic magmatism of the Quit\u00e9ria \nregion represents the early stages of formation of\u00a0the Pelotas \nBatholith (Philipp et\u00a0al. 2013, 2016a). \n\nThe collisional peak was controlled by compression and \nnew shear episodes along the Dorsal de Cangu\u00e7u Shear Zone, \nassociated with the generation of granitic to basic magmas, \nsuggesting important anatexis. This event culminated in the \ngeneration of the granites of the Pinheiro Machado Complex \nand Viam\u00e3o Suite. These suites present U-Pb and Pb-Pb TIMS \nzircon ages between 630 and 620\u00a0Ma (Babinski et\u00a0al. 1997, \nPhilipp et\u00a0al. 2002, 2003, Silva et\u00a0al. 1997). The geochro-\nnological data available for the Viam\u00e3o Suite granites indi-\ncate U-Pb TIMS zircon ages of 595 \u00b1 1\u00a0Ma for the Arroio \nMoinho Granite (Babinski et\u00a0al. 1997), 630 \u00b1 6\u00a0Ma for the \nViam\u00e3o Granite, and a LA-ICP-MS age of 627 \u00b1 16\u00a0Ma for \nthe Bar\u00e3o do Triunfo Granite (Philipp et\u00a0al. 2016c).\n\nLate to post-collisional reactivation of the shear zones \nbetween ca. 610 and 550\u00a0Ma resulted in the emplacement of \nthe alkaline and peralkaline Piquiri and Encruzilhada do Sul \nsuites, and high-K calc-alkaline to alkaline granites of the Dom \nFeliciano suite (Vasquez, 1997, Philipp et\u00a0al. 2003).

The Ponta Grossa Granite has the U-Pb \nTIMS zircon age of 600 \u00b1 9\u00a0Ma (Philipp et al. 2016c). A \npegmatoid leucogranite cutting the Porto Alegre Gneiss \ncrystallized at 585 \u00b1 6\u00a0Ma with inheritance at 739 \u00b1 45\u00a0Ma. \nAccording to Oliveira et\u00a0al. (2001), the Itapu\u00e3 Suite includes \ngranitoids and dike swarms of alkaline affinity that were \npreviously included in the Dom Feliciano Suite. The suite \ncomprises granite, syenogranite,  quartz-syenite and subor-\ndinate syenite, as well as a dyke swarms of comenditic rhy-\nolite to basalt with alkaline to peralkaline affinity (Oliveira \net\u00a0al. 2015). A U-Pb SHRIMP zircon age of 600 \u00b1 3\u00a0Ma \nwas reported for the Santana Granite (Koester et\u00a0al. 2001a). \nNew U-Pb LA-ICP-MS zircon data obtained indicated ages \naround 550\u00a0Ma for the felsic dikes (Oliveira\u00a0et\u00a0al.\u00a02015). \n\nBasement inliers and xenoliths\nDuring ascent and emplacement, the granitic suites cap-\n\ntured xenoliths of the country rocks with dimensions of up to \nseveral kilometers across. Petrographic, geochemical and struc-\ntural data for these xenoliths show that they are comparable to \nthe adjacent metamorphic units of the Nico Perez Microplate. \nBasement inliers are represented by low to high grade meta-\nmorphic rocks, which occur in large areas in the northern por-\ntion of the batholith and as xenoliths of centimetric to deca-\nmetric dimensions in the central and southern areas. The main \nexposures are within granites of the Encruzilhada do Sul Suite, \nand are xenoliths of paragneisses of the V\u00e1rzea do Capivarita \nComplex (VCC) and orthogneisses of the Arroio dos Ratos \nComplex (ARC) (Fernandes et\u00a0al. 1992, Philipp et al. 2016a). \nIn the same region, in the northern part of the Pelotas Batholith, \nis the Capivarita Anorthosite (CA) (Chemale et\u00a0al. 2011). \n\nLarge exposures of the VCC and ARC occur as \u201croof pen-\ndants\u201d in granitoids of the Encruzilhada do Sul Suite and, to a \nlesser extent, of the Cordilheira Suite. The ARC is composed \nof tonalite to granodiorite gneisses cut by granites, and present \ntectonic contacts with the VCC paragneiss (Martil et\u00a0al. 2011, \nGregory et\u00a0al. 2015). Rocks of both complexes were metamor-\nphosed under medium to high grade metamorphic conditions \n(Lima et\u00a0al. 1998, Gross et\u00a0al. 2006, Philipp et\u00a0al. 2013). In this \n\narea, the Capivarita Anorthosite and other Paleoproterozoic base-\nment rocks record the collisional metamorphism under upper \namphibolite to granulite facies conditions (Fernandes et\u00a0al. 1992, \nChemale Jr. et\u00a0al. 2011, Philipp et al. 2016a). The magmatic ages \nof orthogneisses of the ARC are ca. 2.2 \u2013 2.0 Ga (Leite et\u00a0al. \n2000, Silva et\u00a0al. 2005, Gregory et\u00a0al. 2015) with juvenile sig-\nnatures and metamorphism at 631 \u00b1 13\u00a0Ma (Silva et\u00a0al. 2005). \n\nSeveral other smaller gneiss bodies were described high-\nlighting the widespread occurrence of high grade ortho- and \nparagneiss, and also the presence of large xenoliths of schist, \nquartzite and marble of the Porongos Complex in the Herval \nand Pedro Os\u00f3rio regions (Philipp et\u00a0al. 2003). \n\nThe Porto Alegre gneisses have been correlated with the \nARC rocks (Philipp et\u00a0al. 2004). Recently, however, Koester \net\u00a0al. (2016) presented a Neoproterozoic U-Pb SHRIMP zircon \nage of 789 \u00b1 13\u00a0Ma for the Ch\u00e1cara das Pedras orthogneiss, \nindicating probably a new arc generation. The\u00a0xenoliths of \ntonalitic gneiss inside of the gneiss present a U-Pb LA-ICP-MS \nzircon age of 1.993 \u00b1 25\u00a0Ma, probably related to inheritance \nof ARC gneisses (Philipp et al. 2016c). \n\nBased on the pseudosection investigation and in the para-\ngenesis garnet-cordierite-sillimanite-biotite, the metamorphism \nof the VCC occurred at 720 \u2013 820o C and pressure of 8 to 9 \nkbar, characterizing it as of intermediate pressure and high \ntemperature series (Philipp et\u00a0al. 2013). Metamorphic zircon \ngrains of a garnet-sillimanite-biotite gneiss of the VCC and of \nan associated peraluminous leucogranite were dated at 620 \u00b1 \n5\u00a0Ma (main metamorphism) and at 612 \u00b1 6\u00a0Ma for the crys-\ntallization of the leucogranite (Philipp et\u00a0al. 2016a). \n\nU-Pb dating of magmatic and metamorphic zircon grains \nof the Capivarita Anorthosite yielded the age of 1573 \u00b1 21\u00a0Ma \nand of 606 \u00b1 6\u00a0Ma, respectively, whereas titanite grains have \nthe igneous crystallization age of 1530 \u00b1 33\u00a0Ma and metamor-\nphic ages of 651 \u00b1 9\u00a0Ma and 601 \u00b1 5\u00a0Ma (Chemale Jr. et\u00a0al. \n2011). The older metamorphic age is interpreted as the age \nof collisional metamorphism and the younger ages are related \nto the contact metamorphism produced by the Encruzilhada \ndo Sul Granite. The Lu-Hf model ages of the CA showed two \nclusters: from 1.81 to 2.03 Ga (?Hf from +2.2 to +6.4) and \nfrom 2.55 to 2.62 Ga (?Hf from -4.59 to -5.64). This\u00a0mag-\nmatism may represent an important episode of continental \naccretion in an extensional setting during fragmentation of \na supercontinent in the Early Mesoproterozoic.\n\nThe Seival volcano-sedimentary-\nplutonic Association\n\nThe plutonic-volcano-sedimentary Seival Association \nrepresents the late to post-orogenic stages of the Dom \nFeliciano Event (Paim et\u00a0al. 2000, Chemale Jr. 2000). \n\nThe main unit of this association is the Camaqu\u00e3 Basin, \ncomprising four depositional successions associated with \n\n98\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 46(Suppl 1): 83-104, June 2016\n\nTectonic evolution of the Dom Feliciano Belt\n\n\n\nNE-SW shear zones (Fig.\u00a03). In the last three sequences, the \nshear zones and extensional faults probably reached the mantle \nand lower crust levels and generated the volcanic rocks of the \nHil\u00e1rio (Bom Jardim Group), Acampamento Velho (Santa \nB\u00e1rbara Group) and Rodeio formations (Guaritas Group). \nLarge shoshonite to high-K calc-alkaline magmatism defined \nby elongated volcanic bodies parallel to the main transcurrent \nfault systems are suggestive of the role of these structures in \nthe depositional control and also in the origin of magmatism. \n\nTwo main granitoid suites were generated in this period:\n1. Shoshonitic to high-K calc-alkaline and\n2. alkaline granites.\n\nThe emplacement of the shoshonitic granitoids such as \nthe Lavras do Sul is associated with the deposition of the \nBom Jardim Group, whereas the sedimentary and volcanic \nrocks of the Santa Barbara Group are contemporaneous with \nthe emplacement of the Acampamento Velho Formation \nrhyolites and high-K calc-alkaline granitoids such as the \nCa\u00e7apava do Sul Granite and of alkaline granitoids such as \nthe Jaguari, Ramada, Cerro da Cria and S\u00e3o Sep\u00e9 granites.\n\nCamaqu\u00e3 Basin\nSedimentary rocks of the Camaqu\u00e3 Basin have ages \n\nbetween 600\u00a0Ma and 540\u00a0Ma (Paim et\u00a0al. 2000, Chemale Jr. \n2000, Oliveira et\u00a0al. 2014). The basin is formed by different \nsedimentary and volcano-sedimentary units, with associated \nplutonic rocks, and separated from each other by angular or \nerosional unconformities of regional character. The basin was \nfilled and deformed during the late stages of the Brasiliano \norogeny. The deposition is believed to have evolved from \nmarine environments (Maric\u00e1 Group), through transitional \nbetween marine and lacustrine conditions (Bom Jardim and \nSanta Barbara Groups) to fluvial and lacustrine environ-\nments (Guaritas Group) (Figs.\u00a04, 5, 7, 8 and 9). The\u00a0first \ntwo cycles are controlled by NE-SW shear zones associated \nwith transcurrent compressive tectonics under ruptile-duc-\ntile conditions. The last three depositional episodes started \nwith the eruption of volcanic rocks with tholeiitic, high-K \ncalc-alkaline to shoshonitic characteristics (Hil\u00e1rio Formation, \nBom Jardim Group), changing later to bimodal tholeiitic to \nsodic alkaline nature (Acampamento Velho Formation, Santa \nBarbara Group) and finishing with alkaline basaltic volcanics \n(Rodeio Velho Formation, Guaritas Group) (Wildner et\u00a0al. \n2002, Sommer et\u00a0al. 2005, Janikian et\u00a0al. 2012). \n\nThe Maric\u00e1 Group is interpreted to be formed as \nretro-arc foreland basin due collision of the Rio de la \nPlata and Encantadas microcontinent (Borba et\u00a0al. 2006, \n2008). The\u00a0overlying Bom Jardim Group is resulted from \ntranspressive tectonics and associated volcanism (Paim \net\u00a0al. 2000). The upper section of the Camaqu\u00e3 Basin is a \n\ntranstensional rift basin developed when amalgamation of \nthe shield was already completed (Oliveira et\u00a0al. 2015). The \nhigh-K calc-alkaline plutons have SHRIMP and LA-ICP-MS \nU-Pb ages between 598 and 570\u00a0Ma, whereas the alkaline \nplutons crystallized between 570 \u2013 550\u00a0Ma. \n\nEVOLUTION OF THE DOM \nFELICIANO BELT\n\nThe early evolution of the DFB involved the deformation \nof the sedimentary rocks at the western passive margin of the \nNico Perez Microplate and of the Paleoproterozoic units of the \nsialic basement (Fig.\u00a011). The metamorphic evolution of the \nDom Deliciano belt took place during two main collisional \nevents. The first collision occurred between the arc systems \n(Passinho and S\u00e3o Gabriel) and the Nico Perez Microplate \nat ca. 720 \u2013 710\u00a0Ma along the western portion of the belt, \nassociated with the closure of the Charrua Ocean. Subduction \nrelated low- to medium-K calc-alkaline plutonic and volca-\nno-sedimentary associations are represented in the S\u00e3o Gabriel \nTerrane by the Passinho and S\u00e3o Gabriel arcs (Saalmann et\u00a0al. \n2005, 2010). The second and most important collisional \nevent is believed to have been an oblique collision between \nthe RLPC/Nico Perez Microplate (or Encantadas Microplate, \nChemale Jr. 2000) and the Kalahari Craton between 650 and \n620\u00a0Ma (Chemale Jr. et\u00a0al. 2011, Camozzato et\u00a0al. 2012, \n2013, Gregory et\u00a0al. 2015, Philipp et\u00a0al. 2016a). This\u00a0event \nalso caused the strong deformation of the arc related rocks, \npassive margin sedimentary rocks and of units of the sialic \nbasement. The process led to the anatexis of the metamor-\nphic units (Philipp et\u00a0al. 2013, 2016a). \n\nThe Basement\nThe margins of the Nico Perez Microplate in RS is extremely \n\ndeformed and affected by two main events (800 \u2013 760\u00a0Ma \nand 650 \u2013 550\u00a0Ma) and by intense granitic magmatism with \nsubordinate volcanic rocks. Isotopic data suggest that frag-\nments of the Nico Perez Microplate are widespread in many \nareas of the DFB. These gneisses are Paleoproterozoic, and \ntheir parental granitic rocks formed during three orogenic \nepisodes: Siderian (Santa Maria Chico Granulitic Complex, \n2.37 to 2.35 Ga), Rhyacian (Encantadas, Vigia and Arroio dos \nRatos complexes, 2.2. to 2.1 Ga), and less abundant Statherian \nrocks (Seival Metagranite, 1.78 to 1.75 Ga) (Camozzato \net\u00a0al. 2012, 2013, Philipp et\u00a0al. 2013, 2016c). These units \nhave been intruded by Calymmian (1.57 to 1.55 Ga) anoro-\ngenic basic rocks, represented in the Tijucas Terrane by the \nTupi Silveira Amphibolite and in the Pelotas Batholith by \nthe Capivarita Anorthosite (Camozzato et\u00a0al. 2012, 2013, \nChemale Jr. et\u00a0al. 2011).\n\n99\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 46(Suppl 1): 83-104, June 2016\n\nRuy Paulo Philipp et al.\n\n\n\nClosure of the Charrua Ocean\nThe construction of the Neoproterozoic DFB starts \n\nwith the closure of the Charrua Ocean during the Passinho \nand S\u00e3o Gabriel orogenies and later with the collision \nbetween the arc systems and the western margin of the \nNico Perez Microplate. The final stages of evolution of\u00a0the \nBrasiliano orogenic cycle are marked by the closure of the \nAdamastor Ocean during the Dom Feliciano orogeny. \nThis orogenesis is characterized by the emplacement of \nvoluminous syn-collisional high-K calc-alkaline granites \nof metaluminous to peraluminous character, associated \nwith high-grade metamorphism coeval with the colli-\nsion between the Rio de La Plata and Kalahari cratons. \nThe collapse of the Dom Feliciano Belt is defined by \nimportant late- to post-orogenic granitic magmatism of \nhigh-K calc-alkaline to alkaline affinity. This\u00a0is accom-\npanied by the deposition of the four sedimentary suc-\ncessions of the Camaqu\u00e3 Basin, the last three associated \nwith intense volcanic activity.\n\nDuring the last two decades, arc-related Neoproterozoic plu-\ntonic complexes and volcano-sedimentary sequences have been \nrecognized in Goi\u00e1s and Rio Grande do Sul. These\u00a0important \nsubduction-related juvenile crustal accretions took place during \nthe Tonian (Leite et\u00a0al. 1998, Saalmann et\u00a0al. 2010, Philipp \net\u00a0al. 2014). These associations suggest that the duration of the \nBrasiliano orogeny and ocean plate subduction was substan-\ntially longer than what has been suggested in previous models. \nThey demonstrate the existence of small ocean basins separat-\ning continental microplates, which were later amalgamated. \n\nThe new geochronological and isotopic data indicate \nthat subduction between 900 and 700\u00a0Ma marked the ini-\ntial stages of the Neoproterozoic orogenic events in south-\nern Brazil (e.g.\u00a0Hartmann et\u00a0al. 2011). The rock units which \nrepresent this period of oceanic lithosphere consumption are \nexposed only in the S\u00e3o Gabriel Terrane. Opening of the \noceanic basin between the RLPC and Nico Perez Microplate \nstarted at least 0.95 \u2013 0.9 Ga ago (Saalmann et\u00a0al. 2005, 2006, \nArena &amp; Hartmann, 2015) (Fig.\u00a011).

(C) Opening of the Charrua Ocean between the Rio de La Plata Craton (old \nnucleus) and the Nico Perez Microplate (paleoproterozoic mobile belt).\n\n100\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 46(Suppl 1): 83-104, June 2016\n\nTectonic evolution of the Dom Feliciano Belt\n\n\n\nlithosphere started at about 900 to 860\u00a0Ma leading to the \ndevelopment of the Passinho Arc, an intraoceanic island arc \nabove an east-dipping subduction zone (e.g.:Philipp et\u00a0al. \n2014, Lusa et\u00a0al. 2016). Eastward subduction beneath the \nNico Perez Microplate resulted in the establishment of the \nS\u00e3o Gabriel Arc, with active continental margin magmatism \nwith main activity between 780 and 700\u00a0Ma (Saalmann et al. \n2010, Hartmann et\u00a0al. 2011 and references therein). \n\nDextral oblique collision of the arc systems and accretion to \nthe west passive margin of the Nico Perez Microplate occurred \nbetween ca. 710 and 700\u00a0Ma (Remus et\u00a0al. 1999). The colapse \nof the orogen is defined by the formation of a late-orogenic \nbasin represented by the metasediments of\u00a0the Pontas do Salso \nComplex, with a maximum age of ca. 680\u00a0Ma (Vedana et\u00a0al. 2016). \n\nClosure of the Adamastor Ocean\nThe Porongos Complex (PC) formed along the east-\n\nern passive margin of the Nico Perez Microplate. The geo-\ncronological data suggest Paleoproterozoic sources within \nthe Nico Perez and Archean sources from Rio de La Plata, \nCongo and Kalahari cratons for sediments of this part of \nthe complex. Mesoproterozoic zircon grains may have been \nderived from the Andean basement situated in the central \npart of Argentina or, alternatively, from southern Africa \n(Hartmann et\u00a0al. 2004, Gruber et\u00a0al. 2011, Pertile et\u00a0al. \n2015a,b). The\u00a0field data associated with the provenance \ndata suggest that the Porongos basin originated as an east \npassive margin basin of the Nico Perez Microplate. On the \nother hand, the geochemical and U-Pb ages of metavolca-\nnic rocks of the PC suggest that they formed in a continen-\ntal magmatic arc. These data are supported by the age of \nPiratini Gneisses (Silva et\u00a0al. 1997) and by the new data of \nKoester et\u00a0al. (2016). The\u00a0Lu-Hf data presented by Pertille \net\u00a0al. (2015b) indicate that the Porongos metavolcanic rocks \nderived from an old crustal source aged between 2.4 and \n2.2 Ga, and could not be correlated with the S\u00e3o Gabriel \nArc metavolcanics. The metavolcanic rocks of the\u00a0Bossoroca \nComplex display positive ?Hf (+8 to +12) and source age of \n0.9 to 1.0 Ga (unpublished data). \n\nThe volcano-sedimentary rocks of the Porongos Complex \nexposed in the Cachoeira do Sul area display features which \nare different from those of the Santana da Boa Vista region, \nsince they show Neoproterozoic provenance and geochemical \ncharacteristics which are indicative of magmatic arc sources \n(Saalmann et\u00a0al. 2006, Pertile et\u00a0al. 2015a,b). The\u00a0data might \nsuggest the existence of a younger foreland basin.\n\nTwo granite groups have been identified within the \nPorongos Complex:\n1. calc-alkaline muscovite- and tourmaline-bearing peralu-\n\nminous granites, and\n2. alkaline and peralkaline intrusions with aegirine and biotite.\n\nGranites of the first group are coeval with collisional meta-\nmorphism, and the younger are late-orogenic and associated \nwith late-stage movements of the high-angle shear zones in \nthe northern (Cachoeira do Sul) and southern (Candiota) \nareas of the Tijucas Terrane (Camozzato et\u00a0al. 2012, 2013). \n\nThe deformation prograded to the east, being recorded in \nleft-lateral ductile shear zones along the Dorsal de Cangu\u00e7u Shear \nZone which was active between 650 and 620\u00a0Ma (e.g.: Fernandes \net\u00a0al. 1992; Philipp et\u00a0al. 2003, 2013, 2016a). The\u00a0sialic base-\nment of this region, represented by orthogneisses of the ARC \nand paragneisses of the VCC, have been strongly deformed and \nmetamorphosed under medium- to high-grade and intermediate \npressure conditions. As a result of the oblique collision, the Dorsal \nde Cangu\u00e7u Shear Zone formed, which caused partial melting \nin the mantle or lower crustal depths. While this shear zone was \nactive, large volumes of granitic magmas formed, including, for \nexample, the 650\u00a0Ma old Quit\u00e9ria Granite (Koester et\u00a0al. 2001b), \nas well as a smaller volume of mafic magmas. \n\nThe second and most important collisional event was the \noblique collision between the RLPC/Nico Perez Microplate \nand Kalahari Craton between 650 and 620\u00a0Ma (Chemale Jr. \net\u00a0al. 2011, Gregory et\u00a0al. 2015, Philipp et\u00a0al. 2016a). The\u00a0dis-\nplacement of the basement terrains along the NE-SW trans-\ncurrent shear zones was also responsible for generating space \nfor the emplacement of the granitic suites. The anatexis asso-\nciated to the late stage of collisional process generated large \nvolumes of high-K calc-alkaline granitic magmas and resulted \nin the formation of the Pelotas Batholith and associated mafic \nand felsic magmatism of the Camaqu\u00e3 Basin (Philipp et\u00a0al. \n2013, 2016a). This magmatism started with the development \nof the Dorsal do Cangu\u00e7u Shear Zone and emplacement of \nthe Quit\u00e9ria granite. This event took place during or right after \nthe peak of collisional metamorphism generating anatexis of \nthe pelitic gneisses of the VCC and of the orthogneisses of the \nARC. Pseudosection studies suggest temperatures between 740 \nand 820\u00b0C and pressures of  9 to 10 kbar (Philipp et\u00a0al. 2013). \n\nThe Cordilheira Suite formed during this event at ca. 650 \nand 620\u00a0Ma (Philipp et\u00a0al., 2013, 2016a). The collision generated \nlarge volumes of high-K calc-alkaline granites and resulted in the \nformation of the Pelotas Batholith. The\u00a0Cordilheira and Arroio \nFrancisquinho granites are the main bodies of the Cordilheira \nSuite and are emplaced along the the Dorsal de Cangu\u00e7u Shear \nZone. The increase in thermal gradient and ascent of the asthe-\nnosphere at the base of the orogen may have contributed to \nextensive anatexis and generation of peraluminous granitoids. \n\nFollowing continental collision, between 600 and 570\u00a0Ma, \nthe development and emplacement of the Pelotas Batholith \ntook place in the lower crust associated with ductile trans-\ncurrent shear zones. Left-lateral shear also characterized 630 \n\u2013 550\u00a0Ma deformation in the Pelotas Batholith further to \nthe east.

Three\u00a0orogenic events \nknown as the Passinho (0.9 \u2013 0.86\u00a0Ga), S\u00e3o Gabriel (0.77\u00a0\u2013 \n0.68 Ga) and Dom Feliciano (0.65 \u2013 0.54\u00a0Ga) are recognized.\n\nThe evolution of the S\u00e3o Gabriel Terrane is preserved in \nigneous zircon grains, indicating ages of 0.93 Ga to 0.9 for\u00a0the \nopening of the Charrua Ocean and 0.9 to 0.7 Ga for the closure \nand generation of the intraoceanic Passinho Arc (0.9 \u2013 0.86 \nGa) and the S\u00e3o Gabriel Arc (0.77 \u2013 0.68\u00a0Ga). The collision \nof the arc systems against the Nico Perez Microplate occurred \naround 0.71 \u2013 0.7 Ga, and the collapse of the SGT is marked \nby the deposition of the Pontas do Salso Complex at 680\u00a0Ma. \n\nThe Tijucas Terrane is composed of the Paleoproterozoic \northogneiss domes of Santana da Boa and Vigia (Siderian \nand Rhyacian) and of Neoproterozoic metavolcano-sedimen-\ntary rocks (Cryogenian). The Taquaremb\u00f3 Terrane present \n\nthe largest area of Paleoproterozoic orthogneisses (Siderian), \nintruded by granites and covered by Neoproterozoic sedi-\nmentary and volcanic rocks. \n\nAll units of the Dom Feliciano Belt were mapped on a \nregional scale and the inclusion of this database with the current \nset of geochronological and isotopic data has provided significant \nadvances in the understanding of its units and the correlation \nof the processes with other orogenic belts of Brazil and Africa.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe would like to aknowledge the Brazilian National \nCouncil for Scientific and Technological Development \n(CNPq) for the research grants, the Geoscience Institute of \nUniversidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) for \nfield work support and laboratories, and the Geochronology \nResearch Center of Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo\u00a0(USP), for \nthe access to LA-ICP-MS laboratories.
