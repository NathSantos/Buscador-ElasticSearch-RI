Em particular, as membranas de \ntitanossilicatos oferecem vantagens importantes sobre as de ze\u00f3litos, pois \npodem ser sintetizadas sem agentes estruturantes org\u00e2nicos, para evitar a \ncalcina\u00e7\u00e3o subsequente usualmente respons\u00e1vel por defeitos irrevers\u00edveis, \nexibem novas possibilidades de substitui\u00e7\u00e3o isom\u00f3rfica da matriz, permitindo \num ajuste mais fino das propriedades catal\u00edticas e de adsor\u00e7\u00e3o, e s\u00e3o capazes \nde separar misturas com base em diferen\u00e7as de afinidade e tamanho \nmolecular (efeito de peneiro). \n\n     Os objectivos principais deste trabalho foram: i) a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o din\u00e2mica \nde membranas do tipo zeol\u00edtico sintetizadas no Laborat\u00f3rio Associado \nCICECO, realizando-se experi\u00eancias de permea\u00e7\u00e3o com gases puros e \nmisturas; ii) o desenvolvimento e valida\u00e7\u00e3o de novos modelos para a \ntransfer\u00eancia de massa multicomponente atrav\u00e9s de membranas porosas pela \nabordagem de Maxwell-Stefan, tendo em conta os mecanismos espec\u00edficos \nencontrados, particularmente a contribui\u00e7\u00e3o por difus\u00e3o superficial; e iii) a \nmodela\u00e7\u00e3o dos pontos experimentais medidos, bem como dados compilados \nda literatura.  \n\n     De forma a realizar os ensaios de permea\u00e7\u00e3o, desenhou-se, montou-se e \ntestou-se uma instala\u00e7\u00e3o experimental. Para gases puros, os objectivos \nprincipais foram a medi\u00e7\u00e3o de perme\u00e2ncias a temperatura constante, por \nvaria\u00e7\u00e3o da press\u00e3o transmembranar ( P? ), e de perme\u00e2ncias a temperatura \nprogramada, conduzidas a P?  constante. Seguidamente, calcularam-se as \nselectividades ideais. Em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a misturas, a determina\u00e7\u00e3o de selectividades \nreais requer as frac\u00e7\u00f5es molares no permeado e no retido. Na globalidade, \nestudaram-se tr\u00eas suportes diferentes (a\u00e7o inoxid\u00e1vel e ?? alumina) e \ndezanove membranas de AM-3, ETS-10, ZSM-5 e ze\u00f3lito 4A, utilizando-se H2, \nHe, N2, CO2, e O2. A primeira avalia\u00e7\u00e3o explorat\u00f3ria da qualidade das \nmembranas foi feita permeando azoto \u00e0 temperatura ambiente. Assim, \nperme\u00e2ncias superiores a 610 ?  mol/m2s.Pa evidenciavam defeitos grosseiros, \nlevando-nos a efectuar cristaliza\u00e7\u00f5es adicionais sobre as primeiras camadas. \nEste procedimento foi implementado com oito membranas. Um trabalho \nexperimental mais detalhado foi conduzido com cinco membranas.  \n\n \n\n\n\n      Membranas com curvas perme\u00e2ncia-temperatura ( T? ? ) decrescentes \nindicam tipicamente transporte viscoso e de Knudsen, i.e. meso e \nmacrodefeitos. Por exemplo, a membrana n\u00ba 3 de AM-3 exibiu este \ncomportamento com H2, He, N2 e CO2 puros. A contribui\u00e7\u00e3o de Knudsen foi \nconfirmada pela rela\u00e7\u00e3o linear encontrada entre as perme\u00e2ncias e o inverso da \nraiz quadrada da massa molar. O mecanismo viscoso foi tamb\u00e9m identificado, \npois as perme\u00e2ncias eram inversamente proporcionais \u00e0 viscosidade do g\u00e1s \nou, atendendo a equa\u00e7\u00f5es do tipo de Chapman-Enskog, directamente \nproporcionais a 5.02\n\nk Md  (onde kd  \u00e9 o di\u00e2metro cin\u00e9tico e M  a massa molar). \n\n     Um comportamento de permea\u00e7\u00e3o distinto observou-se com a membrana \nn\u00ba 5 de AM-3. As perme\u00e2ncias registadas a temperatura programada eram \naproximadamente constantes para o N2, CO2 e O2, enquanto com o H2 \ncresciam significativamente. Conjuntamente elas evidenciam a ocorr\u00eancia de \nmacro, meso e microdefeitos intercristalinos. O transporte gasoso activado \natrav\u00e9s dos microporos compensa o impacto diminuidor dos meso e \nmacroporos. Ao contr\u00e1rio do N2, CO2 e O2, o pequeno di\u00e2metro do hidrog\u00e9nio \ntorna-lhe poss\u00edvel permear atrav\u00e9s dos microporos intracristalinos, o que lhe \nadiciona um mecanismo de transfer\u00eancia respons\u00e1vel por esse crescimento.  \n\n     No que respeita \u00e0 difus\u00e3o superficial, o sistema CO2/ZSM-5 pode ser \ntomado como um exemplo paradigm\u00e1tico. Uma vez que este ze\u00f3lito adsorve o \nCO2, as perme\u00e2ncias diminuem com o crescimento de P? , em virtude de as \nconcentra\u00e7\u00f5es no s\u00f3lido aumentarem de forma n\u00e3o linear e tenderem para a \nsatura\u00e7\u00e3o. Os resultados contrastantes obtidos com azoto real\u00e7am ainda mais \no mecanismo superficial, pois o N2 n\u00e3o \u00e9 adsorvido e as perme\u00e2ncias medidas \ns\u00e3o constantes. \n\n     Globalmente, as selectividades ideais calculadas ( *? ) variam de cerca de 1 \na 4.2. Este par\u00e2metro foi tamb\u00e9m utilizado para discriminar as melhores \nmembranas, uma vez que baixos valores de *?  denotam o escoamento \nviscoso n\u00e3o-selectivo t\u00edpico de macrodefeitos. Por exemplo, o H2/CO2 na \nmembrana n\u00ba 3 de AM-3 apresentou 2.46.3* ?=?  para 40\u2013120\u00baC, enquanto \nque na membrana n\u00ba 5 de AM-3 originou 1.36.2* ?=? . Estes resultados \ncorroboraram as observa\u00e7\u00f5es anteriores, segundo as quais a membrana n\u00ba 5 \nera melhor do que a n\u00ba 3. Alguns ensaios foram realizados com membranas \nsaturadas com \u00e1gua para aumentar a selectividade: as medi\u00e7\u00f5es mostraram \nclaramente uma melhoria inicial seguida de uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o consistente de \n\n*?  \ncom o aumento da temperatura, devido \u00e0 remo\u00e7\u00e3o das mol\u00e9culas de \u00e1gua \nrespons\u00e1veis pela obstru\u00e7\u00e3o de alguns poros. Em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s selectividades \nreais de misturas contendo hidrog\u00e9nio, devem ser realizadas mais \nexperi\u00eancias e a quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o do hidrog\u00e9nio deve ser melhorada.  \n\n     No que concerne \u00e0 modela\u00e7\u00e3o, novos factores termodin\u00e2micos de Maxwell-\nStefan foram derivados para as isot\u00e9rmicas mono e multicomponente de Nitta, \nLangmuir-Freundlich e Toth, tendo sido testadas com dados de equil\u00edbrio e de \npermea\u00e7\u00e3o da literatura. (\u00c9 importante real\u00e7ar que s\u00f3 est\u00e3o publicadas \nequa\u00e7\u00f5es para Langmuir e Dual-Site Langmuir de componentes puros e \nmisturas). O procedimento de valida\u00e7\u00e3o adoptado foi exigente: i) as \nisot\u00e9rmicas multicomponente foram previstas a partir das de g\u00e1s puro; ii) os \npar\u00e2metros de difus\u00e3o dos componentes puros foram ajustados a dados de \npermea\u00e7\u00e3o de cada g\u00e1s; iii) depois, as difusividades cruzadas de Maxwell-\nStefan foram estimadas pela rela\u00e7\u00e3o de Vignes; finalmente, v) as novas \nequa\u00e7\u00f5es foram testadas usando-se estes par\u00e2metros, tendo sido capazes de \nestimar com sucesso fluxos bin\u00e1rios.  \n\n     Paralelamente ao enfoque principal do trabalho, derivou-se um novo \nmodelo para permuta i\u00f3nica em materiais microporosos baseado nas \nequa\u00e7\u00f5es de Maxwell-Stefan. Este foi validado com dados experimentais de \nremo\u00e7\u00e3o de Hg2+ e Cd2+ de solu\u00e7\u00f5es aquosas usando ETS-4. A sua \ncapacidade preditiva foi tamb\u00e9m avaliada, sendo poss\u00edvel concluir que se \ncomporta muito bem. Com efeito, conseguiram-se boas previs\u00f5es com \npar\u00e2metros optimizados a partir de conjuntos de dados independentes. Este \ncomportamento pode ser atribu\u00eddo aos princ\u00edpios f\u00edsicos s\u00f3lidos da teoria de \nMaxwell-Stefan. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n \n\nMembranes, Titanosilicates, Gas Permeation, Transport Mechanisms, Maxwell-\nStefan, Modelling, Ion Exchange. \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAbstract \n\n \n\nThe growing interest on inorganic membrane applications is due to their \npotential in new industrial and research fields, and as alternative processes to \nmore conventional operations. In particular, titanosilicate membranes offer \nimportant benefits over the classical zeolite ones, since they may be \nsynthesised without organic templates, to avoid the subsequent calcination \nusually responsible for irreversible defects, exhibit novel possibilities of \nisomorphous framework substitution, allowing for fine-tuning catalytic and \nadsorption properties, and are able to separate mixtures based on differences \nin affinity and sieving effect.  \n\n     The main objectives of this work were: i) the dynamic characterization of the \nzeolite type membranes synthesised in our Associated Laboratory CICECO, by \ncarrying out permeation experiments with pure gases and mixtures; ii) the \ndevelopment and validation of new models for the multicomponent mass \ntransport across porous membranes by Maxwell-Stefan approach, taking into \naccount the specific mechanisms found, particularly the surface diffusion \ncontribution; and iii) modelling the experimental points measured, as well as \ndata compiled from literature. \n\n     In order to carry out the permeation essays, an experimental set-up has \nbeen designed, assembled, and tested. For pure gases, the main targets were \nthe measurement of permeances at constant temperature, by varying the \ntransmembrane pressure drop ( P? ), and permeances at programmed \ntemperature, by fixing P? . After that, the ideal selectivites were computed. With \nrespect to mixtures, the determination of the real selectivities demanded the \nmole fractions in permeate and retentate. In the whole, three distinct supports \n(stainless-steel and ?-alumina) and nineteen membranes of AM-3, ETS-10, \nZSM-5, and zeolite 4A have been studied, employing H2, He, N2, CO2, and O2. \nThe first exploratory evaluation of membrane quality was accomplished by \npermeating nitrogen at room temperature. Accordingly, permeances higher \nthan 610 ?  mol/m2s.Pa pointed out rough defects, inducing us to perform \nadditional crystallizations over the first layers. This procedure has been \nimplemented with eight membranes. The more detailed experimental \nprogramme was carried out with five membranes. \n\n      \n\n\n\n      Membranes with decreasing permeance-temperature ( T? ? ) curves \nindicate typically transport by Knudsen and viscous flows, i.e. meso and \nmacrodefects. For instance, the AM-3 membrane number 3 exhibited such \nbehaviour with pure H2, He, N2, and CO2. The Knudsen contribution was \nconfirmed by the linear trend found between permeances and the inverse of the \nsquare root of the molecular weights. The viscous mechanism was also \nidentified, since permeances were inversely proportional to gas viscosity or, \nattending to Chapman-Enskog based equations, directly proportional to \n\n5.02\nk Md (where kd  is the kinetic diameter and M  the molecular weight).      \n\n     A dissimilar permeation behaviour observed in this work involved AM-3 \nmembrane number 5. The registered permeances at programmed temperature \nwere approximately constant for N2, CO2 and O2, while for H2 increases \nsignificantly. In conjunction they evidence the simultaneous incidence of macro, \nmeso and intercrystalline microdefects. The activated gaseous transport across \nmicropores compensates the lowering impact of meso and macropores. In \ncontrast to N2, CO2 and O2, the small hydrogen diameter makes it possible to \npermeate through the intracrystalline micropores, which superimposes an \nadditional transfer mechanism responsible for such increasing.  \n\n     With respect to surface diffusion, the CO2/ZSM-5 system may be taken as a \nparadigmatic example. Once this zeolite adsorbs CO2 the permeances \ndecrease with increasing P? , because the surface loading concentrations \nincrease non-linearly tending to the saturation. The contrasting results obtained \nfor nitrogen emphasizes even more this mechanism, since N2 does not adsorb \nand exhibited constant permeances.  \n\n     Globally, the calculated ideal selectivites ( *? ) ranged from ca. 1 to 4.2. This \nparameter was also utilized to discriminate the best membranes, since low \nvalues denote the non-selective viscous flow typical of macrodefects. For \ninstance, H2/CO2 in AM-3 membrane No 3 presented 2.46.3* ?=?  for 40\u2013\n120\u00baC, while in AM-3 No 5 originated 1.36.2* ?=? . These results corroborated \nprevious findings that AM-3-5 is better than AM-3-3. Some essays were carried \nout with membranes saturated with water to increase selectivity: the \nmeasurements clearly showed an initial enhancement followed by a consistent \nreduction with rising temperature, due to the removal of the water molecules \nresponsible for the blockage of some pores. With respect to real selectivities of \nhydrogen-containing mixtures, more experiments must be performed, and the \nanalytical quantification of hydrogen should be improved.  \n\n     Concerning modelling, new expressions for Maxwell-Stefan thermodynamic \nfactors were derived for pure and multicomponent Nitta, Langmuir-Freundlich, \nand Toth isotherms, being tested with equilibrium and permeation data from \nliterature. (It is worth noting that only pure and binary classical and dual site \nLangmuir equations are available). The validation procedure adopted was very \nstringent: i) the multicomponent isotherms were predicted from pure gas data; \nii) the diffusion parameters of pure components were fitted to single permeation \ndata; iii) then, the Maxwell-Stefan crossed diffusivities were estimated by the \nVignes relation; finally, iv) the new equations were tested using these \nparameters, and were able to estimate successfully binary fluxes.  \n\n     In parallel to the main focus of gas permeation, a new Maxwell-Stefan \nbased model has been also derived for ion-exchange in microporous materials. \nThe model was validated with data for Hg2+ and Cd2+ removal from aqueous \nsolution using ETS-4. Its predicting ability has been also analyzed, being \npossible to conclude it performs very successfully. In effect, good predictions \nwere accomplished with parameters optimized from independent sets of data. \nSuch performance may be attributed to the sound physical principles of \nMaxwell-Stefan theory. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n i \n\nIndex \n \n\nIndex ......................................................................................................................................

Introduction  \n \n\nNowadays, membrane technology is applied in a variety of industries offering a number of \n\nimportant benefits over classical separation processes. For instance, membrane processes \n\nfor gas separation play an increasingly role in reducing the environmental impact and \n\nenergy costs of industrial processes. Moreover, membrane units require a small layout, \n\ncomprising also a low mechanical complexity. \n\nNew application fields have high demands and expectations regarding the thermal \n\nand chemical stability of membranes. The polymeric ones are the most widely used due to \n\ntheir relatively low manufacturing cost, but stability could limit their applications under \n\nharsh environment. Proper inorganic membranes may be robust under such conditions, \n\nwhich allied to high selectivities make them promising alternatives to more conventional \n\nand/or inefficient processes. \n\nThe synthesis of inorganic membranes is an important research area of the \n\nAssociated Laboratory CICECO (University of Aveiro). For instance, new microporous \n\ntitanosilicates, such as AM-n materials, have been firstly synthesized by CICECO teams. \n\nSimilarly to zeolites, titanosilicates exhibit a well-defined three-dimensional crystalline \n\nstructure with molecular dimensions, being able to separate mixtures based on differences \n\nin affinity and sieving effect. Furthermore, titanosilicate membranes offer important \n\nbenefits over the classical zeolite ones, including the possibility of synthesis without \n\norganic templates, which avoids subsequent calcination treatments responsible for \n\nirreversible defects, and exhibit novel possibilities of isomorphous framework substitution, \n\nallowing for fine-tuning catalytic and adsorption properties. \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n 2 \n\nThe performance of a given membrane is primarily associated with its selectivity and \n\npermeance. In order to obtain a high selective membrane, the separation layer crystals must \n\nform a continuous thin film, where the intra-crystalline pores are the unique available \n\npathways for gas permeation. The synthesis procedure of inorganic membranes is based on \n\na cyclic trial and error approach: membranes are prepared and characterized; then, \n\npreparation conditions are continuously optimised until a good quality membrane is \n\nobtained. With this information, the ideal preparation conditions to promote an efficient \n\nintergrowth between crystals may be reached. CICECO owns the relevant equipment to \n\ncarry out a detailed structural and morphological characterization. Beyond this \n\ncharacterization, the study of their permeation properties is indispensable. Membrane \n\nquality should be assessed by measuring permeances of individual gases as well as mixture \n\nseparation factors. Accordingly, this work is focused on the dynamic characterization by \n\npermeability tests of microporous titanosilicate membranes synthesized by CICECO, in \n\norder to optimize their synthesis conditions. \n\nModelling is fundamental to interpret experimental data, predict the dynamic \n\nbehaviour of any process, optimize its operating conditions, and scale up from laboratory \n\nto commercial size. Prediction of the separation performance of a given membrane requires \n\nthe knowledge of multicomponent diffusion, adsorption, and structure parameters, which \n\nmay be determined by experimental methods combined with adequate modelling of \n\nequilibrium and transport phenomena. The Maxwell-Stefan formalism is the most \n\nadvisable and physically sound approach to describe multicomponent diffusion. It is \n\nexceptionally versatile, being successfully applied in this work to describe permeation as \n\nwell as ion exchange through molecular sieves.   \n\nIn the following, the structure of the present thesis will be summarily described. This \n\ndocument is divided into eight chapters. In Chapter II, the main fundaments of membrane \n\ntechnology are briefly boarder. Firstly, an overview of the main membrane processes, \n\nadvantages and applications are presented; afterward, a more detailed discussion around \n\ninorganic membranes is provided, detaching microporous zeolite and titanosilicate \n\nmembranes. Finally, some membrane structural and dynamic characterization methods are \n\ndescribed. This chapter aims a simple elucidation of the main topics covered throughout \n\nthe present work.  \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n 3 \n\nChapter III describes mass transport phenomena occurring in microporous \n\nmembranes. The transport mechanisms for single gases in porous media are firstly \n\nexplained and the corresponding equations presented; subsequently, multicomponent mass \n\ntransport relations are derived based on the Maxwell-Stefan equations and on Irreversible \n\nThermodynamics theory. This chapter is fundamental for the interpretation of the \n\nexperimental data obtained in this work and compiled from literature, whose results are \n\ndiscussed in Chapter VI.  \n\nChapter IV focuses the modelling of ion exchange with microporous titanosilicates \n\nbased on the Maxwell-Stefan equations. Initially, a brief description of the more classical \n\nkinetic models and Nernst-Planck equations is presented. Finally, a detailed model based \n\non the Maxwell-Stefan equations is derived to describe batch ion exchange process using \n\nmicroporous materials. The model is validated using data for metal ions removal from \n\naqueous solution using a microporous titanosilicate.  \n\nChapter V is the experimental section, where the set-up and all procedures adopted \n\nfor the dynamic characterization of membranes are described in detail.  \n\nIn Chapter VI, modelling and experimental data are presented and discussed. New \n\nexpressions for Maxwell-Stefan thermodynamic factors are derived for pure and \n\nmulticomponent Nitta, Langmuir-Freundlich, and Toth isotherms, being tested with \n\nequilibrium and permeation data from literature. The permeation measurements in AM-3, \n\nETS-10, ZSM-5, and zeolite 4A membranes, at fixed and programmed temperatures, are \n\nalso given. Data are modelled based on the gas transport mechanisms described in Chapter \n\nIII.  \n\nThe major conclusions of this thesis are pointed out in Chapter VII, along with some \n\nsuggestions for future work. \n\n \n\n\n\nFundamentals of Membrane Processes \n\n 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nII. Fundamentals of Membrane Processes \n \n\n1. Introduction \n\nMembrane technology is becoming a very promising field of separation processes. In \n\nrecent years the development of this technology has being expanding and the number of \n\npotential applications growing rapidly, mainly owing to the availability of microporous \n\nmembranes. \n\nA membrane is a semipermeable barrier separating two phases, where mass transfer \n\noccurs under the action of a driving force (Mulder, 1997; Tavolaro and Drioli, 1999). In \n\nmembrane processes, a feed mixture is separated into two streams: permeate (which \n\npermeates the membrane) and retentate (which does not diffuse through membrane). \n\nSeparation takes place owing to the membrane ability to transport one component from the \n\nfeed mixture more readily than the others, due to differences in size, shape or affinity \n\n(Mulder, 1997).  \n\nSeveral membrane processes may be distinguished essentially by the driving force \n\nresponsible for permeation (i.e. gradients in pressure, concentration, temperature or \n\nelectrical potential), the physical state of streams, and membrane type. Accordingly, one \n\nmay distinguish microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, gas \n\npermeation, pervaporation, dialysis, electrodialysis, membrane electrolysis, thermal-\n\nosmosis, and membrane distillation. It is well known that the actual driving force for \n\ntransmembrane transport arises from a gradient in chemical potential (electrical potential \n\nincluded), as will be explained in Chapter III. A detailed description of distinct membrane \n\n\n\nFundamentals of Membrane Processes \n\n 6 \n\nprocesses may be found in fundamental texts (Rautenbach and Albrecht, 1989; Ho and \n\nSirkar, 1992; Mulder, 1997). \n\nMembrane technology offers a number of important benefits over classical \n\nseparation processes (Mulder, 1997; Koros, 2004; Rand and Dell, 2008). For instance, (i) \n\nseparation can be carried out continuously; (ii) the energy consumption is generally low, a \n\nhighly required quality when presently energy conservation is one of the most important \n\npriorities for the industry, reducing the environmental impact and energy costs of industrial \n\nprocesses \u2013 the energy required in some large-scale separations can be one order of \n\nmagnitude lower when membranes are used instead of traditional thermal separations; (iii) \n\nmembranes can be easily combined with other separation processes, giving rise to hybrid \n\nprocesses; (iv) separation can be carried out under mild conditions; (v) up-scaling is easy \n\nand membrane units require a small layout, which makes them attractive for isolated \n\napplications such as offshore gas-processing platforms; and (vi) membrane properties are \n\nvariable and can be adjusted to the specific requirements of each process. Despite such \n\nbenefits, membrane technology is still under development holding a number of drawbacks, \n\nsuch as (i) the possibility of concentration polarization and membrane fouling, which \n\nreduces the permeation fluxes and change the selectivity of the process, giving rise to a \n\nfrequent need of cleaning; (ii) low lifetime and selectivity; (iii) the up-scaling factor is \n\nmore or less linear; and (iv) the operating temperature and pH conditions may affect the \n\nmembrane structure and must be taken into account. \n\nNowadays, membranes are applied in a variety of industries to recover valuable \n\nproducts or to reduce unwanted chemicals from exhaust streams. For instance, they may be \n\nfound in petrochemical, food processing, metallurgy, pulp and paper, textile, \n\npharmaceutical, automotive, dairy, and biotechnology industry (Burggraaf and Cot, 1996; \n\nMulder, 1997). Moreover, membrane technology is becoming increasingly important also \n\nin water treatment for domestic and industrial water supply (Mulder, 1997). In seawater \n\ndesalination, membranes operations are an effective approach for solving the freshwater \n\nrequirements in many regions of the world, at lower costs and minimum environmental \n\nimpact (Bernardo et al., 2009). In other applications, membranes have been combined and \n\nembodied with chemical or biochemical reactions, where they work as catalysts as well as \n\nselective barriers to remove one of the products, shifting the chemical equilibrium, or to \n\n\n\nFundamentals of Membrane Processes \n\n 7 \n\nselectively remove reaction inhibitors. Membranes can be used to enhance the conversion \n\nof de-hydrogenations, partial oxidations, isomerisations and esterifications (Caro and \n\nNoack, 2008), or to remove inhibitory compounds during fermentation processes  (Crespo \n\nand Carrondo, 1993). For instance, Akamatsu et al. (2009) obtained hydrogen with purity \n\nup to 99.9% by dehydrogenation of cyclohexane using a hydrogen-selective amorphous \n\nsilica membrane. Caro et al. (2005) investigated the reaction of n-propanol with propionic \n\nacid using a ZSM-5 water-selective membrane, and obtained an enhancement from 52% to \n\n92% in the ester yield for infinite reaction time. Kita et al. (2007) found conversions of \n\nabout 100% during esterification of lactic acid with ethanol using hydrophilic ZSM-5 and \n\nMOR membranes.  \n\nConcerning gas separations, some relevant industrial applications are: (i) H2/N2 and \n\nH2/hydrocarbon separations in ammonia and petrochemical plants; (ii) separation of N2 \n\nfrom air; (iii) CO2 and water removal from natural gas; (iv) removal of CO2 from process \n\nstreams to prevent the \u201cgreenhouse effect\u201d; (v) removal of volatile organic compounds \n\nfrom air or nitrogen streams; (vi) removal of H2S from natural gas, refinery gas, and coal \n\ngas streams for odor control; and (vii) separation of hydrocarbon isomers in the \n\npetrochemical industries (e.g., mixtures of alkanes). The oxygen enrichment of air for \n\nmedical purposes is also an important example (Burggraaf and Cot, 1996). \n\nThe performance of a given membrane is primarily related with its nature, i.e., its \n\nmaterial and structure. Membranes can be natural or synthetic; the last ones can be further \n\nsubdivided into organic (polymeric) and inorganic (e.g., alumina, metal and zeolites) \n\n(Mulder, 1997; Tavolaro and Drioli, 1999). Synthetic membranes may be also classified \n\nbased on their morphology or structure. This is a very pertinent classification since these \n\ncharacteristics may determine its application. Accordingly, two classes of membranes are \n\ndistinguished: dense (non-porous) and porous membranes. Following IUPAC \n\nclassification, porous membranes are microporous ( 2p&lt;d nm), mesoporous ( 502 p&lt;&lt;d\n\nnm) or macroporous ( 50p >d nm). Dense membranes are capable of separating molecules \n\nbecause of differences in solubility and/or diffusivity, where solubility plays a particularly \n\nsignificant role. Porous membranes induce separation by differences in size, shape, or \n\naffinity between permeating molecules and the material (Burggraaf and Cot, 1996; Mulder, \n\n1997). In fact, microporous membranes can discriminate molecules of similar diameters, \n\n\n\nFundamentals of Membrane Processes \n\n 8 \n\npolarities and/or molecular weight. In addition, their structures may be tuned in order to \n\nsuit a particular separation. Accordingly, pore size and host-sorbate interactions can be \n\nadjusted by chemical modifications, such as ion exchange or changing the framework \n\ncomposition.  \n\nConcerning its structure, inorganic membranes can be symmetric or asymmetric. \n\nSymmetric membranes (or isotropic) are composed by a single material with one chemical \n\ncomposition and one morphological structure. These structures are usually thick in order to \n\nobtain mechanical strength, which is a disadvantage for obtaining large fluxes. On the \n\nother hand, asymmetric membranes (or anisotropic) are composed by two or more \n\nstructural planes with different morphology, consisting generally in a combination of a \n\nsupporting system with large pores and layers with gradually decreasing pore size. In this \n\nway, thin films and consequently higher permeabilities may be obtained (Burggraaf and \n\nCot, 1996; Tavolaro and Drioli, 1999). A schematic representation of synthetic membranes \n\nstructures is presented in Figure II.1. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure II.1 \u2013 Schematic representation of synthetic membrane structures. \n\n \n\nMembrane systems (support and separation layer) are generally assembled into \n\nmodules (Burggraaf and Cot, 1996). Five module architectures can be distinguished, \n\nnamely: tubular, capillary, hollow fibre, plate and frame and spiral-wound modules \n\n\n\nFundamentals of Membrane Processes \n\n 9 \n\n(Rautenbach and Albrecht, 1989). The transport properties of membrane systems are also \n\ndependent on the architecture of the membrane modules (Burggraaf and Cot, 1996).  \n\nThe performance of a given membrane in gas separation is mostly characterized by \n\ntwo parameters: selectivity and permeability. The selectivity describes the capacity of a \n\ngiven membrane to separate the components of a mixture and quantifies the enrichment of \n\nthe desired product relatively to the feed stream; the permeability is the rate at which the \n\nmolecules permeate through a membrane and determines the membrane productivity. Both \n\nhigh selectivity and high permeability are required to obtain good quality and economically \n\nfeasible membranes. Nonetheless, low permeability can be compensated to a certain extent \n\nby an increase in the membrane surface area. Low selectivity leads to multi-stage \n\nprocesses, which in most cases are not economically viable when compared with \n\nestablished conventional processes (Rautenbach and Albrecht, 1989). The permeation flux \n\nof a molecule i  through the membrane is given by the following relation: \n\n( ) ( )force drivingforce driving, \u00d7?=\u00d7\n?\n\n= i\niM\n\ni\n\nP\nN  (II.1)\n\nwhere iMP ,  is the membrane permeability for species i , ?  is the membrane thickness, and \n\n??? iMi P ,  is the permeance. In the case of gases at low pressure, the partial pressure \n\ndifference across membrane, ip? , provides the driving force in gas mixture permeation, \n\ni.e., ipifpifii yPxPppp ?=?=? ,, , where subscripts f  and p  stand for feed and permeate, \n\nrespectively, P  is total pressure, and ix  and iy  are the molar fractions of component i  in \n\nthe retentate and permeate streams. For non-ideal gases, fugacities should be used instead. \n\nTaking into account previous equations, one obtains: \n\n( )pifiii PyPxN ??=  (II.2)\n\nwhich for pure gases simplifies to: \n\n( ) PPPN ipfii ??=??=  (II.3)\n\n\n\nFundamentals of Membrane Processes \n\n 10 \n\nThe separation factor, ij? , expresses the selectivity of the membrane towards a \n\nmixture of components i  and j , which for gases is: \n\n( )\n( ) ???\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n??+??\n???+??\n\n?=??\n11\n\n11*\niji\n\nijiji\nij\n\nji\n\nji\nij x\n\nx\nxx\nyy\n\n (II.4)\n\nwhere \nfp PP=? , and the ideal selectivity, jiij ????\n\n* , is the key parameter to preview \n\nmembrane performance, and corresponds to the situation where 0?? , i.e., pf PP >>  \n\n(Mulder, 1997). A number of factors are responsible for selectivity deviations from the \n\ncorresponding ideal values, such as pressure and temperature conditions or non-ideality \n\ndue to co-existence of molecules in the mixture. Nonetheless, ideal values found in \n\nliterature can be taken as a good starting point for the selection of an appropriate \n\nmembrane material (Koros, 1995; Hsieh, 1996). It is important to refer that separation \n\nfactors are frequently influenced not only by differences in intrinsic diffusivities, but also \n\nby their adsorption extent. For instance, the presence of an adsorbed compound may hinder \n\nthe diffusion of other molecules, which may reduce strongly the permeability in \n\nmicroporous materials. This subject will be discussed in more detail in Chapter III. \n\n   \n\n2. Inorganic membranes \n\nNew membrane application fields have high demands and expectations regarding its \n\nthermal stability for high temperature applications, solvent and chemistry stability, \n\nsterilization ability and biocompactibility (Caro et al., 2000). Although polymeric \n\nmembranes show interesting selectivity in many gas separations, they can, in general, \n\nhardly operate successfully at harsh conditions. On the other hand, the high thermal and \n\nchemical stability and resistance to high pressure differences of microporous inorganic \n\nmembranes make them promising materials for new gas separation applications. Moreover, \n\nthe chemical stability of polymeric membrane is also limited with respect to pH and \n\norganic liquids, whereas inorganic materials can generally be applied at a large pH range \n\nand in any organic solvent. Also important are their greater lifetime and ease of cleaning, \n\nespecially in high fouling applications (Mulder, 1997).  \n\n\n\nFundamentals of Membrane Processes \n\n 11 \n\nMany efforts have been made to design new polymers or modify existing materials in \n\norder to overcome the stability limitations of polymeric membranes (Shao et al., 2009). For \n\ninstance, interesting properties may be found by the synthesis of a block polymer system, \n\nconsisting of microphase separated structures of hard glassy and soft rubbery polymer \n\nsegments (Okamoto et al., 1995; Powell and Qiao, 2006). In this case, gas permeation \n\noccurs primarily through the flexible chain structure of rubbery segments, which provides \n\na good permeability, while glassy polymers offer mechanical support and chemical and \n\nthermal resistance, especially when formed by high temperature materials such as \n\npolyimides or polypyrrolones (Powell and Qiao, 2006). Synthesis of organic-inorganic \n\nhybrid membranes or mixed-matrix membranes is an additional technique to enhance the \n\nproperties of polymeric membranes (Merkel et al., 2002; Bernardo et al., 2009) . The use \n\nof two materials with different flux and selectivity allows the combination of polymers \n\nfeatures with the high performance of inorganic materials. However, besides economical \n\nadvantages of mixed-matrix membranes over inorganic ones, their brittleness and \n\ndifficulties for commercial scale manufacture remain important challenges.  \n\nInorganic membranes can be synthesized from different materials (e.g., ceramic, \n\nglass, metal and zeolite-type materials). The most studied microporous inorganic \n\nmembranes are amorphous metal oxides and zeolites. The first group has a very limited \n\nhydrothermal stability, excluding them for gas separation in atmospheres containing steam \n\nat high temperature. On the other hand, zeolite and related materials (e.g., titanosilicates \n\nand vanadosilicates) offer much better thermal and hydrothermal stability (Rocha and \n\nAnderson, 2000). \n\nAt this point, it is convenient to clarify some nomenclature aspects. The terms zeolite \n\nand molecular sieve are often indistinctly used in literature. It is then straightforward to \n\npresent a convenient classification of molecular sieves as function of their composition, \n\nwhich is given in Figure II.2. \n\n\n\nFundamentals of Membrane Processes \n\n 12 \n\nMolecular Sieves\n\nOtherSilicates AluminophosphatesMetalloaluminates\n\nTitanoSilicates\n\nOther\n\nGallo-Germanates\n\nMeAPSO\n\nEIAPO\n\nMeAPO\n\nSAPO\nGermanium-\nAluminates\n\nMetalloSilicates\n\nZeolites\n\nOther\n\nFerrisilicates\n\nGallosilicates\n\nBorosilicates\n\n \n\nFigure II.2 \u2013 Classification of molecular sieve materials, as proposed by Szostak (1989). \n\n \n\n2.1 Zeolite membranes  \n\nIn recent years, zeolites have attracted increasing interest due to their potential applications \n\nas separation membranes, catalytic membrane reactors, chemical sensors, electrodes, opto-\n\nelectronic devices, or low dielectric constant materials for use as electrical insulators, \n\nprotection or insulation layers (Caro and Noack, 2008).  \n\nZeolites are three-dimensional microporous crystalline solids with a well defined \n\nstructure of channels and cavities (Breck, 1974; Rocha and Anderson, 2000). These \n\nmaterials have a regular framework formed by a three-dimensional combination of SiO4 \n\nand AlO4 tetrahedrons building blocks connected with each other by shared oxygen atoms. \n\nAn isolated SiO4 group contains a charge of -4 while it is neutral in a solid containing an \n\nO/Si ratio of two, since each oxygen atom is connected with two Si atoms; the AlO4 unit \n\ncharge is -1. Accordingly, the global structure of zeolites carries a negative charge, which \n\nis neutralized by exchangeable extra-framework cations, generally from groups I and II of \n\nperiodic table. The structural formula of zeolites may be expressed for the crystallographic \n\nunit cell as:  \n\n\n\nFundamentals of Membrane Processes \n\n 13 \n\nMx/n[(AlO2)x(SiO2)y].mH2O  \n\nwhere M  is a cation of valence n , which balances the negative charge,  m  is the number \nof water molecules in the zeolite, and the sum yx +  is the total number of tetrahedra in the \n\nunit cell. The channels and cavities of zeolites framework are occupied by the cations and \n\nwater molecules.  \n\nBased on their pore dimensions, zeolites are classified into small, medium, large, and \n\nultra-large pore materials (Tavolaro and Drioli, 1999; Guisnet and Giilson, 2002; Chao et \n\nal., 2008). Small pore structures have eight-membered ring pore aperture, medium pore \n\nstructures have 10-membered rings, large pore zeolite have 12-membered rings, and ultra-\n\nlarge frameworks consist of 14-, 18-, and 20-membered rings. Some examples of zeolite \n\nstructures with different pore dimensions are pictured in Figure II.3 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure II.3 \u2013 Classification of zeolites based on pore dimensions. Adapted from Chao et \nal. (2008).  \n\n \n\nZeolite materials own a number of advantages over other microporous materials, \n\nsuch as pores with uniform molecular dimensions, ion exchange capability and selectivity, \n\ninteresting adsorption properties, relatively easy catalytic activation, possibility to develop \n\ninternal acidity, high thermal stability and high internal surface area (Tavolaro and Drioli, \n\n1999). Additionally, they can be regenerated using relatively easy and well known \n\nmethods, as thermal, pressure, and related swing adsorption, or ion exchange (Wankat, \n\n1994). \n\n\n\nFundamentals of Membrane Processes \n\n 14 \n\nThe molecular sieving action of microporous zeolites, together with their large \n\nsurface areas and controlled host-sorbate interactions, are the primary motivations in \n\nzeolitic membranes (Tavolaro and Drioli, 1999). These features allow them to carry out \n\nseparations which are out of reach for common membranes (e.g. separation of isomers or \n\ncompounds with similar diameters, polarities and/or molecular weight) and compete with \n\ntraditional separation methods.  \n\nIn order to prepare supported membranes, zeolite crystals need to grow on porous \n\nsubstrates to form a continuous film, having the zeolitic pores as the unique available \n\npathway for molecules transport (Tavolaro and Drioli, 1999). Zeolite membranes are \n\ncommonly prepared by in situ direct hydrothermal synthesis on porous supports. This \n\nmethod involves one step liquid-phase hydrothermal synthesis on the top or inside of \n\nsupport pores, which is immersed into a zeolite precursor gel or clear solution, under \n\nautogenous pressure and at a constant temperature.  \n\nAlternatively, the zeolite layer can be formed in two steps using seed crystals, which \n\ngrow together to form a continuous supported zeolite layer in a subsequent hydrothermal \n\nsynthesis. With this seeding crystallization technique, the nucleation and the crystal growth \n\nare decoupled allowing a controlled preparation of supported zeolite membranes. In the \n\nfirst step, a colloidal suspension of zeolite crystal seeds is prepared in the absence of the \n\nsupport. Subsequently, these seeds are deposited on the surface support and brought into \n\ncontact with a solution containing the necessary nutrients for growth. A continuous zeolite \n\nlayer is then formed by a second crystallization step. Since the concentration needed for \n\nsecondary growth is lower than the required for nucleation, further nucleation is strongly \n\ndecreased and almost all crystals growth takes place over the existing crystal seeds. By \n\nregulating the composition and concentration of the secondary growth solution, the rate \n\nand direction of crystals growth can be controlled. An oriented zeolite film is advantageous \n\nbecause the number of intercrystalline defects is reduced when crystals grow uniformly in \n\nthe same direction. Moreover, higher permeabilities could be expected when crystal \n\norientation allows the channels to be aligned with flow direction (Coronas and Santamaria, \n\n1999). Furthermore, by providing the nutrients from the growth side, membrane thickness \n\ncan be more accurately controlled; in this way, membranes with a thickness of only a few \n\nhundreds nanometres may be prepared.  \n\n\n\nFundamentals of Membrane Processes \n\n 15 \n\nFinally, zeolite layers can also be synthesized by crystallization of an amorphous dry \n\ngel on the porous support either by a vapour-phase transport method, when the structure-\n\ndirecting agent (SDA) is in the vapour, or by steam-assisted crystallization with a dry gel \n\ncontaining the SDA (Coronas and Santamaria, 1999; Caro et al., 2000; Caro and Noack, \n\n2008).  \n\nUndesirable transmembrane pathways larger than the intracrystalline zeolite pores, \n\ni.e. defects, are frequently formed during membrane synthesis. Larger defects could be \n\neliminated by repeated crystallization (Coronas and Santamaria, 1999; Tavolaro and Drioli, \n\n1999). A number of researchers have concluded that their membranes prepared in a single \n\nhydrothermal synthesis had defects because of the lack of connectivity between the \n\nindividual particles, which points out that one synthesis may be not enough to achieve \n\nsufficient crystal intergrowth. Elimination of small defects may be possible by post-\n\nsynthesis processing methods such as chemical vapor deposition of silica, via reaction with \n\na silicon alkoxide or other silylation agents. Those treatments involve reduction of the pore \n\nopenings on the external surface of the crystals (Coronas and Santamaria, 1999; Tavolaro \n\nand Drioli, 1999).  \n\nThe synthesis of supported zeolite membranes has been carried out following trial \n\nand error procedures. The starting point to obtain a new zeolite membrane involves, in \n\ngeneral, a synthesis gel with a composition similar to that reported for the synthesis of the \n\nzeolite as individual crystals. Once synthesised, the membrane would be subjected to \n\ncharacterization, and, depending on the results obtained, the synthesis would be repeated \n\nunder different preparation conditions: gel composition, synthesis time, method of wetting \n\nthe support, or rotation of the autoclave. It is worth noting that the presence of the support \n\nintroduces a number of new factors which makes synthesis more difficult to reproduce. For \n\ninstance, the mechanism of nucleation changes because the surface of the support provides \n\nnucleation sites that are not present in homogenous synthesis, and the support itself may \n\ndissolve in the synthesis gel and change its composition (Coronas and Santamaria, 1999). \n\n \n\n\n\nFundamentals of Membrane Processes \n\n 16 \n\n2.2 Titanosilicate membranes  \n\nMicroporous titanosilicates are novel materials that may broad the scope of application of \n\nzeolite membranes and thin films to separations, catalytic membrane reactors and sensors. \n\nThe structure of these materials consists of interlinked octahedral and tetrahedral \n\nframeworks. Similarly to zeolites, titanosilicates exhibit a well-defined three-dimensional \n\ncrystalline structure with molecular dimensions, being able to separate mixtures based on \n\ndifferences in affinity and sieving effect (Lin et al., 1997; Liu et al., 1997; Liu et al., 1999; \n\nRocha and Anderson, 2000). Moreover, they offer important benefits over classical zeolite \n\nmembranes, namely: i) they are generally synthesised in the absence of organic templates, \n\navoiding usual subsequent calcination treatments (at nearly 500\u00baC), which often cause \n\nirreversible defects and/or loss of active surface groups; ii) they are usually prepared under \n\nmoderate pH conditions (generally, at pH=10\u201313), reducing chemical attack to the support; \n\niii) they exhibit novel possibilities of isomorphous framework substitution, allowing for  \n\nfine-tuning catalytic and adsorption properties; and iv) generally, they have strong \n\nalkalinity, complementing the acid properties of classic zeolites (Lin et al., 2004). \n\nAM-3 (Aveiro-Manchester number 3) is a synthetic microporous titanosilicate \n\nanalogue of mineral penkvilksite, with an ideal formula Na4Ti2SiO22.5H2O (Lin et al., \n\n1997). Its structure consists of SiO4 tetrahedra connected by individual TiO6 octahedra \n\nforming a three-dimensional framework of 6-ring channels (Lin et al., 2006). In a previous \n\nwork it was shown that AM materials do not adsorb any significant amount of nitrogen but \n\nthey do adsorb water in relatively large amounts (Lin et al., 1997). In addition, AM-3 was \n\ndemonstrated to be stable up to ca. 600 \u00baC, loosing water and rehydrating reversibly after \n\nbeing kept in air for a few hours at room temperature. A detailed morphological \n\ncharacterization of AM-3 was first reported by Lin et al. (1997) and later by Rocha and \n\nAnderson (2000). Figure II.4a shows a scanning electron micrograph of AM-3 crystals. \n\nETS-10 (Engelhard Titanosilicate number 10) is a synthetic microporous \n\ntitanosilicate discovered by Kuznicki (1989), with no mineral analogue. Its structure is \n\ncomposed by corner sharing SiO4 tetrahedra and TiO4 octahedra, linked by oxygen atoms, \n\nforming a three-dimensional system of wide 12-membered pores. This material shows a \n\ndisordered structure and has excellent characteristics for diffusion (Rocha and Anderson, \n\n2000). Moreover, ETS-10 has a remarkable high thermal stability. The structural formula \n\n\n\nFundamentals of Membrane Processes \n\n 17 \n\nof the ETS-10 basic unit is Si4OTi8O10416-, which is balanced by 16 monovalent cations \n\n(usually Na+ and K+) (Rocha and Anderson, 2000). A scanning electron micrograph of \n\nETS-10 crystals is presented in Figure II.4b. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure II.4 \u2013 Scanning electron micrograph of: a) AM-3 crystals and b) ETS-10 crystals \n(Lin et al., 1997; Pavel et al., 2002).  \n\n \n\nOnly a small number of microporous titanosilicate membranes have been synthesized \n\nand characterized, mainly reporting on ETS-4 (Braunbarth et al., 2000; Guan et al., \n\n2001,2002). Accordingly, separations of N2 from CO2, O2, Ar and CH4 as well as \n\npervaporation experiments of water/ethanol mixtures have been investigated using this \n\nmaterial. Preparation of ETS-4 films on porous alumina and titania supports have been also \n\ndescribed by Yilmaz et al. (2006), however only the crystals orientation was investigated. \n\nHetero-epitaxial growth of ETS-10 on ETS-4 has been performed, but no permeation or \n\nseparation results have been published (Jeong et al., 2002). Preparation and \n\ncharacterization of ETS-10 membranes were presented for the first time by Lin et al. \n\n(2004), where pure N2 permeation and water/alcohol pervaporation experiments were \n\ncarried out. Subsequently, permeation of different gases at programmed temperature, and \n\npropylene/propane separation studies in ETS-10 membranes were reported by Tiscornia et \n\nal.  (2005,2007). These studies showed ETS-10 is able to separate propylene/propane and \n\nwater/ethanol mixtures with separation factors ranging between 3.8-6.5 and 7-12, \n\nrespectively. Sebastian et al. (2005,2006,2008) reported the synthesis, characterization, \n\na) b) \n\n\n\nFundamentals of Membrane Processes \n\n 18 \n\nand separation properties of a Ti-Silicate umbite membrane (AM-2) prepared on porous ?-\n\nalumina and TiO2 tubular supports by seeded hydrothermal synthesis; selectivities higher \n\nthan 30 were obtained for H2 separation from N2, CO2 or propane mixtures. Moreover, \n\nSebastian et al. (2008) used AM-2 membranes for H2/N2 separation in the presence of \n\nmoisture concluding that, unlike other microporous zeolitic hydrophilic membranes, water \n\nshould not permeate through the intrinsic micropores of the zeolitic material, undergoing \n\ncapillary condensation in the inter-crystalline defects, giving rise to an increase in the \n\nH2/N2 selectivity. Reported results have revealed the potential of these membranes for real \n\napplications concerning purification of hydrogen-containing streams, and H2 proton-\n\nexchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells.  \n\n \n\n3. Characterization methods \n\nThere is no universal method for characterization of all materials due to the numerous \n\ncharacteristics involved and because the wide variety of membrane operating conditions \n\ninfluences directly its performance. Frequently, more than one technique is required in a \n\ndetailed examination (Burggraaf and Cot, 1996). A combination of well defined \n\ncharacterization techniques gives valuable information about membrane morphology, \n\nwhich may suggest possible fields of application. In addition, it can serve as a feed-back \n\nfor high quality membrane preparation.  \n\nTwo different types of characterization methods can be distinguished for porous \n\nmembranes: structure-related methods, in which the pore size, pore size distribution, top \n\nlayer thickness, surface porosity and crystallinity are determined; and permeation-related \n\nmethods, where the actual separation parameters are investigated. There are a number of \n\nstructural characterization techniques available for porous media, being the following the \n\nmost frequently used for microporous membranes: X-ray diffraction (XRD), which is \n\nindispensable to identify the crystals formed in the synthesis, and to evaluate their purity; \n\nscanning electron microscopy (SEM), used to analyse the shape and size of crystals, and \n\ntheir distribution on the support, as well as to provide a measurement of membrane \n\nthickness and a first impression on the existence of inter-crystalline defects; and surface \n\nanalyzing techniques such as electron-probe microanalysis (EPMA), X-ray Photoelectron \n\n\n\nFundamentals of Membrane Processes \n\n 19 \n\nSpectroscopy (XPS) or Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX), used to measure the \n\nchemical elements concentration across the membrane. Concerning the permeation-related \n\nmethods, the determination of the gas permeabilities through synthesized materials is \n\nparticularly important because it is the only tool allowing verification of membrane \n\ncompactness and selectivity (Tavolaro and Drioli, 1999). Specific permeation \n\nmeasurements, either of single gases or multicomponent mixtures, provide extremely \n\nuseful information on the effective membrane pore structure, and on the existence of inter-\n\ncrystalline defects. Moreover, in contrast with structural characterization techniques, the \n\nwhole membrane surface may be investigated. Permeation experiments are often \n\ncomplemented by adsorption measurements, which may help to identify and/or distinguish \n\nthe involved permeation mechanisms (Coronas and Santamaria, 1999). With permeation \n\nresults, the ideal preparation conditions to promote an efficient intergrowth between \n\ncrystals can be found. Finally, the permeation of mixtures is the real test to evaluate \n\nmembrane quality to perform a given separation.  \n\n \n\n4. Hydrogen Purification  \n\nHydrogen is an alternative clean fuel for future sustainable energy economy. The \n\ndevelopment of \u201cThe Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology Platform\u201d of the European \n\nUnion (HFPeurope, 2009 ) clearly supports the importance of this subject. Presently, steam \n\nreforming, partial oxidation of hydrocarbons, autothermal reforming, and gasification of \n\nbiomass are the best economically viable options for H2 production (Hsieh, 1996; Fang et \n\nal., 2008; Rand and Dell, 2008). The downstream processing of the resulting mixtures, \n\nmainly H2/CO2, H2/N2, and H2/light-hydrocarbons, can be advantageously accomplished \n\nby membrane technology (Hsieh, 1996). \n\nMany techniques are in use or under study for hydrogen separation and purification, \n\nincluding PSA, cryogenic separation, catalytic purification and membrane processes. \n\nMembrane technology for gas separation plays an increasingly vital role owing to their \n\nwell known advantages. Several membrane materials have been used for H2 recovery. Pd \n\nmetal membranes show long-term thermal and mechanical stability, as well as high \n\nseparation factors towards H2; however, Pd and its alloys are extremely expensive, making \n\n\n\nFundamentals of Membrane Processes \n\n 20 \n\nthis material economically impractical for large-scale applications (Freemantle, 2005; \n\nAdams and Mickalonis, 2007). In addition, another technical disadvantage of Pd \n\nmembranes is their high sensitivity to chemicals, such as sulphur or even CO (Freemantle, \n\n2005). Polymeric membranes are the most widely used due to their relatively low \n\nmanufacturing cost, but their chemical and thermal stability limits their application in H2 \n\npurification under harsh conditions. For instance, H2 and CO2 are formed at high \n\ntemperature during the steam reforming process. An efficient separation of the produced \n\nH2 should occur at the reforming temperature, which is over 450\u00baC. Unlike polymeric \n\nmembranes, the inorganic ones are robust under such conditions and may exhibit high \n\nselectivities.  \n\nAmorphous metal oxides membranes have very limited hydrothermal stability, \n\nexcluding them for H2 removal from atmospheres containing steam at high temperature. \n\nOn the other hand, zeolite membranes offer much better thermal and hydrothermal \n\nstability, but the pore size of most applied materials is not sufficiently narrow for highly \n\nselective H2 separation. Titanosilicate membranes may become especially competitive for \n\nindustrial applications due to their narrow pore size, promoting an effective size-exclusion \n\nseparation.  \n\n\n\nGas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media \n\n 21 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIII. Gas Transport and Adsorption in Porous \nMedia \n\n \n\nThe understanding of mass transport mechanisms is essential for an accurate modelling of \n\nthe permeances. Modelling is fundamental for interpretation of experimental data and as a \n\npredictive tool. Prediction and correlation of permeation and separation behavior requires \n\nknowledge on single and multicomponent diffusion, adsorption and structure parameters. \n\nThese parameters may be determined by experimental methods and adequate modelling of \n\ntransport phenomena. This chapter describes mass transport phenomena and adsorption \n\nequilibrium occurring in microporous membranes. First, transport mechanisms for single \n\ngases in porous media are briefly explained, and the corresponding equations presented. \n\nMulticomponent mass transport relations for the flux through microporous membranes are \n\nsubsequently derived based on Irreversible Thermodynamics theory and on the Maxwell-\n\nStefan equations. Finally, the adsorption equilibrium of pure and multicomponent systems \n\nis discussed in the last section of the chapter. \n\n \n\n1. Single gas permeation \n\nThe transport mechanisms involved in porous media (see Figure III.1) are primarily related \n\nwith pore diameter, pd . Accordingly, viscous flow dominates in macropores ( 50p >d nm), \n\nwhere the fluid flows as a whole under a pressure gradient. In mesopores and micropores (\n\n502 p&lt;&lt;d nm and 2p&lt;d nm, respectively), collisions between molecules and pore \n\nsurface are fundamental. When the mean free path, ? , (i.e., the average distance traversed \n\n\n\nGas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media \n\n 22 \n\nby a molecule between collisions) is comparable or larger than the pore diameter, transport \n\nfalls in Knudsen regime. In small micropores, pore size approaches the molecular \n\ndimensions and the molecules may not be as free as in Knudsen diffusion, where the effect \n\nof the potential field of the solid surface is minimal (Burggraaf and Cot, 1996). In this \n\ncase, commonly described as configurational diffusion, molecules may never completely \n\nescape from the force field of the surface (Xiao and Wei, 1992a) and diffusion becomes an \n\nactivated process. Based on the mode of translational motion of molecules inside the pores, \n\ntwo distinct mechanisms may be distinguished here: molecules may retain their gaseous \n\nstate (gas translational or activated gaseous diffusion) or lose their gaseous entity due to \n\nstrong interaction with the solid framework and move as an adsorbed phase (solid vibration \n\nor surface diffusion) (Xiao and Wei, 1992a). \n\n \n\nViscous flow\n\nKnudsen diffusion\n\nSurface diffusionActivated gaseous diffusion\n\n \nFigure III.1 \u2013 Distinct mass transport mechanisms involved in single gas transport in \nporous media. Adapted from Krishna (1993). \n\n \n\nSeveral approaches have been proposed in literature to describe surface diffusion \n\n(Uhlhorn et al., 1992; Burggraaf and Cot, 1996; Burggraaf, 1999), including the hopping \n\nmodel, by which molecules move over the surface by hopping between adjacent adsorption \n\nsites (minima in the potential energy field of the pore) (Gilliland et al., 1974; Okazaki et \n\nal., 1981; Xiao and Wei, 1992a; Krishna, 1993), the hydrodynamic model, in which \n\nadsorbed molecules are considered as a fluid film, which merely slide along the surface \n\n(Gilliland et al., 1958; Gilliland et al., 1974), and the random walk model, based on the \n\n\n\nGas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media \n\n 23 \n\ntwo-dimensional form of Fick\u2019s first law. Nonetheless, the hopping model is the most \n\nfrequently adopted for modeling surface diffusion in micropores (Krishna, 1990; Xiao and \n\nWei, 1992a,b; Krishna, 1993; Bakker et al., 1997; Krishna and Paschek, 2000; Krishna and \n\nBaur, 2003; Krishna et al., 2004), being adopted as well in this dissertation.  \n\nSimilarly to the surface diffusion, the activated transport of gaseous molecules inside \n\nthe pore may be assumed to occur by a sequence of jumps from site to site, restricted by \n\nthe energy barrier imposed by the surface. Several authors report the activated gaseous \n\ndiffusion as an activated process analogous to a Knudsen mechanism, denoting it by \n\nactivated Knudsen diffusion (Bakker et al., 1996; Burggraaf and Cot, 1996; Burggraaf, \n\n1999; Romero et al., 2004). However, Burggraaf and Cot (1996) present a slightly \n\ndifferent concept to describe this mechanism. In their description, molecules are assumed \n\nto move freely between adsorption sites, involving an activated sub-step and a Knudsen \n\ndiffusion step. This situation is reported for a ratio between pore diameter and kinetic \n\nmolecular diameter around two. Moreover, the configurational diffusion regime is reached \n\nwith decreasing pore size, where the remaining gaseous state within the pore is assumed to \n\nbe vanished and only surface diffusion may occur.  \n\n \n\n1.1 Viscous flow \n\nIn macropores, intermolecular collisions are dominant and the mean free path of diffusion \n\nspecies is smaller than the pore diameter. In this case, the molar flux, vJ , under a pressure \n\ngradient may be described by a Hagen-Poiseuille type-law:   \n\ndz\ndP\n\nT\nP\n\n?\nd\n\n?\n?\n\nJ\n?\n\n?=\n32\n\n2\np\n\nv   (III.1)\n\nwhere ?  is the gas viscosity, P  and T  are the total pressure and temperature, respectively, \n\n?  is the gas constant, and z  is distance coordinate. The factor ??  is introduced in the \n\nflux equation to account for geometrical effects of the porous structure, being ?  and ?  the \n\nporosity and tortuosity, respectively. \n\n\n\nGas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media \n\n 24 \n\nAt steady-state, the permeance through a porous membrane may be obtained after \n\nintegration of equation (III.1) over the membrane thickness, ? : \n\nT\nP\n\n??\nd?\n\nP\nJ\n\n??\n=\n\n?\n?? m\n\n2\npv\n\nv 32\n  (III.2)\n\nwhere mP  is the arithmetic mean pressure between two sides of the membrane.  \n\nIt may be noted from equation (III.2) that permeance under viscous flow increases \n\nwith increasing mean pressure, and declines with rising temperature (note that gas \n\nviscosity also increases with temperature). \n\n \n\n1.2 Knudsen diffusion \n\nKnudsen diffusion prevails in mesopores, where the mean free path of diffusing species is \n\nclose to the pore diameter (Knudsen, 1909). Under this regime, molecule-pore wall \n\ncollisions are important, being responsible for diffusion.  \n\nKnudsen diffusivity, KnD , may be expressed as the product of a geometric factor by a \n\ncharacteristic diffusion length and by the velocity of gas molecules (Xiao and Wei, 1992a). \n\nIn this case, the diffusion length is the pore diameter, and the velocity of diffusing \n\nmolecules is given by the kinetic theory of gases. The geometric factor is 3/1  since only \n\nthose molecules moving in the direction under consideration must be taken into account \n\n(Xiao and Wei, 1992a). Thus, \n\n5.0\np\n\nKn\n\n8\n3\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n? ?=\n?M\n\nTd\nD  (III.3)\n\nwhere M  is the molecular weight of the diffusing gas.  \n\n Mass transport of single gases in porous media may be described by the Fick\u2019s first \n\nlaw (Fick, 1855a,b):  \n\n\n\nGas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media \n\n 25 \n\ncDJ ??=  (III.4)\n\nwhere D  is the Fick diffusion coefficient, ? is the gradient operator, and c  is the \n\nconcentration of diffusing species. The expression for Knudsen diffusion flux, KnJ , may be \n\nobtained by combining equation (III.3) with the Fick\u2019s first law (III.4), expressed in terms \n\nof the pressure gradient, and introducing factor ??  in order to account for structure \n\ngeometrical effects (Burggraaf and Cot, 1996): \n\ndz\ndP\n\nTM??\n?d\n\nJ\n.50\n\np\nKn\n\n8\n3\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?=  (III.5) \n\nThe Knudsen permeance through a porous membrane may be found after integration \n\nof equation (III.5) over the membrane thickness: \n\n50\npKn\n\nKn\n\n8\n3\n\n.\n\nT?M?\n?d\n\nP\nJ\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n??\n=\n\n?\n??  (III.6) \n\nAs pointed out by equation (III.6), permeance due to Knudsen diffusion is pressure-\n\nindependent and decreases with temperature. \n\n \n\n1.3 Diffusion in micropores \n\nAs aforementioned, the hopping model will be adopted in the following discussion. Gas \n\ndiffusion in micropores may be explained as an activated process (Xiao and Wei, 1992a). \n\nIn this case, the Fick diffusion coefficient may be expressed as follows: \n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n=\nT\nE\n\nlugD ad exp  (III.7)\n\nbeing g  a geometrical factor, u  the mean velocity of diffusing species, and dl  the \n\ndiffusion length. The exponential term reflects the activated nature of the process and \n\nexpresses the probability of a molecule to have sufficient kinetic energy to surmount an \n\n\n\nGas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media \n\n 26 \n\nenergy barrier, aE . The parameters involved in equation (III.7) are dependent on the pore \n\nand molecule dimension and thus on the corresponding system.  \n\nMass transport of single gases is generally described by the Fick\u2019s first law, where a \n\nconcentration gradient is assumed to be the driving force (see equation (III.4)). However, \n\nthe true driving force for diffusion is believed to be the chemical potential gradient \n\n(Ruthven, 1984), which is most relevant in a microporous system. Accordingly, the \n\npermeation flux of a single gas in micropores (in the z\u2013direction), in isothermal conditions, \n\nis more accurately described by: \n\nz\n?\n\nqB?J\n?\n?\n\n?=  (III.8)\n\nwhere B  is the mobility of diffusing gas, q  is its molar concentration in the particle, ?  is \n\nthe particle density, and ?  is the chemical potential. Assuming the gas phase as ideal, i.e., \n\nPT?? ln0 ?+= , where 0?  is its standard chemical potential, the following relationship \n\nmay be obtained:  \n\ndz\nPd\n\n?q\u00d0J\nln\n\n?=  \n(III.9) \n\n \n\nwhere TB\u00d0 ?=  is a corrected diffusion coefficient equivalent to a Maxwell-Stefan (MS) \ndiffusivity (Krishna, 1990,1993; Krishna and Wesselingh, 1997). Similarly to the \n\nMaxwell-Stefan formulation, a thermodynamic factor may be defined as qP? lnln ??= , \n\nand the expression for permeation may be written as: \n\ndz\ndq\n\n??\u00d0J ?=  \n(III.10)\n\n \n\nFick and corrected diffusivities are related by the thermodynamic factor as \u00d0?D = . \nThis relation, known as Darken equation, expresses the concentration dependence of Fick \n\ndiffusivity, involving a generally concentration-independent corrected diffusivity. The \n\nintegration of equation (III.10) is only possible if the relation between q  and P  is known. \n\n\n\nGas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media \n\n 27 \n\nIn the following, its application to activated gaseous diffusion and surface diffusion \n\nmechanisms will be analyzed. \n\n \n\n1.3.1 Activated gaseous diffusion \n\nIn the case of activated gaseous diffusion, the velocity of the molecules in gas phase is \n\ndescribed by the kinetic theory of gases, similarly to the Knudsen mechanism, the diffusion \n\ndistance may be considered the distance between two adjacent sites of low energy, dl , \n\nwhile  the geometrical factor is the probability of a molecule moving in the direction under \n\nconsideration, Z1 , being Z  the number of adjacent sites (Xiao and Wei, 1992a). The \n\nactivation energy, ga,E , is the energy required for molecules to surmount the attractive \n\nconstrictions imposed by the pore structure. As a result, the diffusivity of gaseous \n\nmolecules is given by: \n\n??\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n? ?=\n\nT\nE\n\n?M\nT\n\nl\nZ\n\nD d\nga,\n\n5.0\n\ng exp\n81   (III.11)\n\nSince there is no formal adsorption, the flux may be expressed in terms of pressure. \n\nHence, from equations (III.9) and (III.11) one may obtain:  \n\ndz\ndP\n\nT\nE\n\nT?M\nl\n\nZ\nJ d ??\n\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?= ga,\n\n5.0\n\ng exp\n81   (III.12)\n\nPermeance through a microporous membrane may be found after integration of \n\nequation (III.12) over the membrane thickness: \n\n??\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n??\n=\n\n?\n??\n\nT\nE\n\nT?MZ\nl\n\nP\nJ\n\nd ga,\n5.0\n\ng\ng exp\n\n8   (III.13)\n\nEquation (III.13) shows an exponential dependence of gas permeance on the \n\ntemperature, differently from that of the Knudsen model. \n\n \n\n\n\nGas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media \n\n 28 \n\n1.3.2 Surface diffusion \n\nFor surface diffusion of adsorbed molecules, the diffusion length corresponds to the \n\ndistance between two adjacent sites, dl , and the geometrical factor represents the \n\nprobability of a molecule moving in the direction under consideration, Z/1 , similarly to \n\nthe activated gaseous diffusion mechanism (Xiao and Wei, 1992a). Additionally, the \n\nvelocity of adsorbed molecules is given by the product of the jump frequency, ( )q? , with \nthe jump distance. Hence, Fick diffusivity may be expressed as \n\n( ) ( ) ( ) ??\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n=??\n\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?=\n\nT\nE\n\nqD\nT\n\nE\nql\n\nZ\nqD sd\n\nsa,0sa,2\ns expexp\n\n1\n (III.14)\n\nwhere ( ) ( )ql\nZ\n\nqD ds ?=\n20 1 . According to the relation between Fick and corrected \n\ndiffusivities, \n\n( ) ??\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n==\n\nT\nE\n\n?\u00d0?\u00d0qD sa,0sss exp  (III.15)\n\nwhere sa,E  is the activation energy for surface diffusion. \n\nIn order to determine the thermodynamic factor and thus the flux of adsorbed \n\nmolecules, the isotherm must be known. Based on different concepts and assumptions, a \n\nnumber of adsorption models can be found in literature (Do, 1998; Burggraaf, 1999; \n\nPakizeh et al., 2007), as will be discussed next in section 2.3.  \n\nThe adsorption of gas molecules in microporous membranes occurs frequently in \n\nmonolayer, being accurately represented for a large number of cases by the Langmuir \n\nisotherm:  \n\nPb\nPb\n\nq\nq\n\n?\nL\n\nL\n\nsat 1 +\n==  (III.16)\n\n\n\nGas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media \n\n 29 \n\nwhere ?  is the fractional occupancy, satq  is concentration of adsorbed molecules at \n\nsaturation, and Lb  is the Langmuir equilibrium adsorption constant. The temperature \n\ndependency of Lb  can be correlated by a van\u2019t Hoff-type expression: \n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n??\n\n??\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n= 1exp1exp ads0\nst\n\nT\nT\n\nT\nH\n\nb\nT\nT\n\nT\nQ\n\nbb o\no\n\no\n\no\noL  (III.17)\n\nwhere stQ  is the isosteric heat of adsorption, adsH?  is the enthalpy of adsorption, and ob  is \n\nLb  at the reference temperature  oT . \n\nFor the case of Langmuir regime, the thermodynamic factor reduces to: \n\n \n?\n\n?\n?\n\n=\n1\n\n1\n (III.18)\n\nThe surface flux of adsorbed molecules in micropores may be then obtained after \n\nsubstitution of equations (III.15) and (III.18) into equation (III.10): \n\ndz\ndq\n\nT\nE\n\n?\n\u00d0\n\n?J ??\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?= sa,\n0\ns\n\ns exp1\n          (III.19)\n\nor, expressed in terms of the fractional occupancy, ? ,   \n\ndz\nd?\n\nT\nE\n\n?\n\u00d0\n\n?qJ ??\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?= sa,\n0\ns\n\nsats exp1\n (III.20)\n\nBy integration over the membrane thickness, the surface permeance is found to be: \n\npff\n\npsa,0\nssat\n\ns\ns\n\n1\n1\n1\n\nlnexp\nPP?\n\n?\nT\n\nE\n\u00d0q\n\n?\nP\n\nJ\n??\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n??\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n=\n?\n\n??\n \n\nor  \n\n( )\n( ) pfadsp\n\nadsfsa,0\nssats\n\n1\nexp1\nexp1\n\nlnexp\nPPTHbP\n\nTHbP\nT\n\nE\n\u00d0q\n\n?\n??\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n???+\n???+\n\n??\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n=?\n \n\n(III.21)\n\n\n\nGas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media \n\n 30 \n\nwhere the subscripts f  and p  refer to membrane feed and permeate sides conditions, \n\nrespectively.  \n\nAs shown by equation (III.21), the dependence of surface permeance on temperature \n\nis not quite straightforward. Following Burggraaf (1999), assuming 1pL&lt;Pb , a maximum \n\nin the permeance may be expected when adssa, HE ??&lt;. Similarly, Van de Graaf et al. \n\n(1998b) analyzed the permeance behavior with temperature and demonstrated that (i) if \n\nadssa, HE ??> , no solution is found and there is no maximum in the flux as function of \n\ntemperature, being the activated  diffusion dominant over all temperature range; (ii) if \n\nadssa, HE ??= , a maximum exists only when occupancy approaches zero; in this case the \n\nflux approaches an asymptotic value at higher temperatures becoming temperature-\n\nindependent, and (iii) if adssa, HE ??&lt;, a maximum in the flux can effectively be observed. \n\nThe same conclusions were drawn by Kapteijn et al. (2000b) by calculating the first \n\nderivative of the permeation flux equation.  \n\nCorrected, or MS, diffusivities have been assumed here to be concentration-\n\nindependent; however, s\u00d0  is generally function of molecular loading (Krishna, 1990; \n\nKrishna and Paschek, 2000; Krishna and Baur, 2003; Krishna et al., 2004). Molecular \n\ndynamics (MD) simulations have shown this simplification is accurate in a number of \n\nsystems but may considerably fail in others. For instance, Skoulidas and Sholl (2001,2002) \n\nobtained occupancy-independent diffusivities of He, Ar and Ne in MFI (silicalite and \n\nZSM-5 zeolites) while for larger molecules, such as CF4 and SF6, they were found to \n\ndepend on surface occupancy. Moreover, Monte Carlo simulations performed by Paschek \n\nand Krishna (2000) for diffusion of 2-methylhexane in silicalite also exhibit a dependence \n\nof s\u00d0  on surface loading. The behavior of MS diffusion coefficient with occupancy has \n\nbeen found to diverge concerning the permeating gas and membrane structure. For \n\ninstance, MS diffusivities of several gases through different zeolite structures were shown \n\nto decrease strongly with increasing loading, following in many systems the relation \n\n( ) ( )?\u00d0\u00d0 ?=? 10)( ss , where ( )0s\u00d0  is the zero-loading diffusivity (Krishna, 1990; Krishna \nand Paschek, 2000; Krishna and Baur, 2003; Krishna et al., 2004).  \n\n\n\nGas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media \n\n 31 \n\nAt low pressures the Henry\u2019s regime for adsorption is frequently valid. Under these \n\nconditions, the concentration of adsorbed gas depends linearly on the pressure, i.e., \n\nKPq =  (III.22)\n\nwhere K  is the Henry\u2019s constant. As for the case of activated gaseous diffusion, the \nthermodynamic factor is here unity, and thus Fick and corrected diffusion coefficients are \n\nequal and concentration-independent (Gavalas, 2008). In this case equation (III.10) equals \n\nthe Fick\u2019s first law. The dependence of K  on temperature is also given by a van\u2019t Hoff-\ntype relation: \n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n??\n\n??\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n=\n\nT\nH\n\nK\nT\n\nQ\nKK ads0\n\nst\n0 expexp  (III.23)\n\nAccordingly, the surface flux under Henry\u00b4s regime is given by: \n\ndz\ndP\n\nT\nEH\n\nK?DJ ??\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n??\n?= sa,ads0\n\n0\nss exp  (III.24)\n\nThe permeance through a microporous membrane may be found after integrating \n\nequation (III.24) over the membrane thickness:  \n\n??\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n??\n?\n\n=\n?\n\n??\nT\n\nEH\nKD\n\n?\nP\n\nJ a,sads\n0\n\n0\ns\n\ns\ns exp  (III.25)\n\nAs equation (III.25) shows, the permeance-temperature behavior under Henry\u2019s \n\nregime depends on the relative values of sa,E  and adsH? . The permeance will \n\nmonotonically increase or decrease when the activation energy for diffusion is larger or \n\nsmaller than the heat of adsorption, respectively . \n\n \n\n1.4 Gas permeation through microporous membranes \n\nIt is generally found that both surface and activated gaseous diffusion mechanisms \n\ncontribute to the overall mass transport through a microporous membrane.  The degree to \n\n\n\nGas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media \n\n 32 \n\nwhich each mechanism contributes to the total permeation depends mainly on the \n\nadsorption properties of the system, as well as on the conditions of temperature and \n\npressure (Dong et al., 2000; Gardner et al., 2002; Zah et al., 2007). Moreover, in real \n\nmembrane systems, Knudsen diffusion and/or viscous flow may be expected to contribute \n\nto the total permeation flux as well, owing to the presence of defects in the crystalline \n\nstructure. \n\nThe fluxes from different diffusion mechanisms are additive. Accordingly, the total \n\npermeation flux through microporous membranes may be written as follows:  \n\n \ngsKnvmicroporesdefectstotal JJJJJJJ +++=+=   (III.26)\n\nIt is worth noting that the effect of the support must be taken into account in the calculation \n\nof the effective totalJ , since only a fraction of the total area is available for permeation. This \n\nobligates to multiply equation (III.26) by a support geometric factor, which is commonly \n\nassociated to its porosity and tortuosity. \n\nThe transport mechanism controlling the permeation process may be discriminated \n\nfrom the permeance-temperature behavior, in agreement with the previous discussion. For \n\ninstance, diffusion of non-adsorbable gases in micropores is expected to increase \n\nmonotonically with temperature. However, a minimum in the permeance is frequently \n\nfound at low temperatures, which can be ascribed to the presence of defects, since \n\npermeation flux resulting from both viscous and Knudsen mechanisms decreases with \n\nincreasing temperature. \n\nThe transport of strongly adsorbing molecules at low or moderate temperatures is \n\ndominated by surface diffusion, while activated gaseous diffusion may prevail at high \n\ntemperatures (van den Broeke et al., 1999b; Zhu et al., 2006; Gavalas, 2008). In this case, \n\na maximum followed by a minimum in the permeance could be anticipated (Bakker et al., \n\n1997; Coronas et al., 1997; Burggraaf et al., 1998; van de Graaf et al., 1998a). At low \n\ntemperatures, permeance increases because the diffusivity of adsorbed molecules is \n\nenhanced by temperature, even though the surface coverage simultaneously decreases; at a \n\ngiven temperature, the decrease in the adsorbed concentration becomes the determining \n\nfactor, so that the overall permeance will start to decrease. At higher temperatures, \n\n\n\nGas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media \n\n 33 \n\nadsorption could be negligible and permeance would be expected to exponentially \n\nincrease, given the activated nature of diffusion through micropores (Nishiyama et al., \n\n2001). Once more a minimum in the permeance is commonly observed at lower \n\ntemperatures, which may be attributed to an additional contribution of viscous and/or \n\nKnudsen mechanisms. \n\n \n\n2. Multicomponent Diffusion \n\nMulticomponent mass transport has been described based on three main approaches, \n\nnamely, the Fickian formalism, the thermodynamics of irreversible processes (IT) theory, \n\nand the generalized Maxwell-Stefan (MS) equations.  \n\nThe widely applied Fick\u2019s first law (equation (III.4)) may be generalized to describe \n\nmulticomponent systems (Taylor and Krishna, 1993). However, these diffusivities do not \n\nhave the same physical significance of the binary coefficients since they do not reflect pair \n\ninteractions. Moreover, similarly to single component diffusion, for accurate modeling and \n\ntheoretical understanding of multicomponent diffusion, it is convenient to adopt the more \n\nfundamental approach based the chemical potential gradients as the true driving force for \n\ndiffusion (Krishna, 1990,1993; Krishna and Wesselingh, 1997; Smit and Maesen, 2008). \n\nFurthermore, in the presence of electrostatic or centrifugal force fields, Fick\u2019s first law \n\ncannot be properly applied (Krishna, 1990,1993; Krishna and Wesselingh, 1997). \n\nAs alternative to the generalized Fick\u2019s law, both the irreversible thermodynamics \n\nand the Maxwell-Stefan models express the diffusion fluxes in terms of chemical potential \n\ngradients and can include the effect of external force fields into the respective equations.  \n\n \n\n2.1 Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes (IT) \n\nTransport phenomena occur under the action of driving forces. While irreversible mass and \n\nheat fluxes take place, local equilibrium may be assumed, and a thermodynamic treatment \n\nmay be valid near equilibrium under steady state conditions (Haase, 1969).  \n\n\n\nGas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media \n\n 34 \n\nTransport through membranes may be described by thermodynamics of irreversible \n\nprocesses. During irreversible processes, under the action of a constant driving force, the \n\nfree energy is continually dissipated and entropy is produced. Such entropy production \n\nprovides a fundamental difference between irreversible and classical thermodynamics, \n\nwhere entropy is constant.  \n\nThe derivation of the IT model involves three postulates (Bitter, 1991; Mulder, \n\n1997), namely: \n\n(1) The rate of entropy production in irreversible processes, ? , is calculated from the \n\ndissipation function, ? , which always has the form:   \n\n0ii ?==? ? XJT?\ni\n\n      (III.27)\n\nwhere the iJ  are generalized fluxes and iX  the appropriate (conjugate) generalized forces. \n\n (2) Close to equilibrium, a linear dependence of the flux and the forces is assumed:  \n\nj\n1\n\nij XLJ\nm\n\nj\ni ?\n\n=\n\n=    (III.28)\n\nwhere ijL  are the Onsager coefficients.  \n\n(3) Following the Onsager reciprocal relations, the coefficients ijL  are symmetric, \n\ni.e.: \n\njiij LL =  (III.29)\n\nFor an isothermal binary system in the absence of any external forces, the driving \n\nforce is the chemical potential gradient, ?? , and thus: \n\n2121111 ?L?LJ ????=  (III.30)\n\n2221212 ?L?LJ ????=  (III.31)\n\n\n\nGas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media \n\n 35 \n\nDiffusion flux equations derived from irreversible thermodynamics provide a real \n\ndescription for transport through membranes. Besides, the existence of coupling of driving \n\nforces and/or diffusion fluxes can be evidenced and clearly described (Bitter, 1991; \n\nMulder, 1997). However, in this description the membrane is considered as a black box \n\nand no information is obtained or required about molecules permeation, which may limit \n\nthe applicability of this approach concerning the membrane nature and separation \n\nmechanisms (Bitter, 1991; Mulder, 1997). \n\n \n\n2.2 Maxwell-Stefan Equations  \n\nMaxwell-Stefan formalism is the most widely used approach to describe multicomponent \n\ndiffusion. Although formally equivalent to the IT theory, it is recognized to be the most \n\nadvantageous and preferable alternative (Krishna, 1990; Gardner et al., 2002; Krishna, \n\n2009).  \n\nMS model was originally developed for description of binary mixtures (Krishna, \n\n1990,1993; Krishna and Wesselingh, 1997). Accordingly, in order to cause a relative \n\nmotion between the two components of the mixture, a force must be exerted on each \n\ncomponent. This force on molecule 1 is balanced by the friction between both species, \n\nwhich is proportional to their relative velocity, and to the molar fraction of the second \n\nmolecule, 2x . The force balance is then given by: \n\n)( 212\n12\n\n1 uux\u00d0\nT\n\n? ?\n?\n\n=??  (III.32)\n\nwhere 1u  and 2u  are velocities of 1 and 2 , respectively, and 12\u00d0  is the  Maxwell-Stefan \n\ndiffusivity, which describes the interaction between both components; the term 12\u00d0T?  \n\nmay be interpreted as a drag coefficient between the molecules. Equation (III.32) may be \n\ncombined with the definition of molar flux, i.e. iiti uxcN = , to get: \n\n\n\nGas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media \n\n 36 \n\n12t\n\n2112\n1\n\n1\n\n\u00d0c\nNxNx\n\n?\nT\n\nx ?\n=?\n\n?\n?          (III.33)\n\nbeing tc  the total molar concentration. \n\nSince friction between different species is explicitly accounted by the Maxwell\u2013\n\nStefan theory, it may be especially suitable for describing multicomponent mass transport. \n\nThe MS model presented for a binary mixture can thus be extended to a general \n\nmulticomponent system. In this case, generalized MS equations express the balances \n\nbetween the chemical potential gradient of species i  and the friction exerted on i  by all \n\nother species j , according to:  \n\n??\n?\n=\n\n?\n=\n\n?\n=\n\n?\n=?\n\n?\n?\n\nn\n\nij\nj\n\nn\n\nij\nj \u00d0c\n\nJxJx\n\u00d0c\n\nNxNx\n?\n\nT\nx\n\n1 ijt\n\njiij\n\n1 ijt\n\njiij\ni\n\ni    (III.34)\n\nwhere ij\u00d0  represents de interaction between each ji ?  pair. From the Gibbs-Duhem \n\nrestriction, ? = =?\nn\n\ni\n?x\n\n1 ii\n0 , it follows that only 1?n  of these equations are independent.  \n\nThe driving force term in equation (III.34) may be expressed as function of the mole \n\nfraction gradients by introducing the thermodynamic factors, ij? : \n\n     ?\n?\n\n=\n\n??=?\n?\n\n1\n\n1\njiji\n\ni\nn\n\nj\nx?\n\nT\nx\n\n, where \nj\n\ni\niijij\n\nln\nx\n\nx\n?\n\n??\n+?=?  \n\n                                                   1,...,2,1, ?= nji  \n\n(III.35)\n\nbeing i?  the activity coefficient of species i  in the mixture, which may be evaluated  by \n\nthermodynamics models (e.g., the Wilson, NRTL, UNIQUAC, and UNIFAC models). For \n\ndense gas mixtures exhibiting deviations to the ideal gas behavior, fugacity coefficient may \n\nbe used instead (Taylor and Krishna, 1993).  \n\nFor simplicity, equation (III.34) can be combined with equation (III.35) and \n\nexpressed in 1?n  dimensional matrix form, explicitly written in terms of diffusion fluxes: \n\n\n\nGas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media \n\n 37 \n\n[ ] [ ] ( )xBcJ ???= ?1t)(          (III.36)\n\nbeing the elements of [ ]B  defined as follows: \n\n?\n?\n=\n\n+=\nn\n\nik\nk \u00d0\n\nx\n\u00d0\nx\n\nB\n1 ik\n\nk\n\nin\n\ni\nii ,  ?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n??=\n\ninij\niij\n\n11\n\u00d0\u00d0\n\nxB  (III.37)\n\nBy comparison of equation (III.36) with the generalized Fick\u00b4s law [ ]( )xDcJ ??= t)( , \nit follows that Fick and Maxwell-Stefan coefficients are related by:  \n\n[ ] [ ] [ ]?= ?1BD  (III.38)\n\nWhile Maxwell-Stefan diffusivity has a fundamental physical meaning of an inverse \n\ndrag coefficient, Fick diffusivity couples the drag effects with thermodynamic non-ideality \n\neffects (Krishna, 1993). Hence, MS diffusivity may be more easily interpretable and \n\npredictable than Fick diffusivity. Besides, because of the strong composition dependence \n\nof thermodynamic factor, Fick diffusivity may be expected to exhibit strong composition \n\ndependence as well. For ideal systems it may be easily found that [ ] [ ] 1?= BD . \n\nThe superiority of the MS formalism in terms of physical interpretation of the \n\ncorresponding diffusivities can be extended to the Onsager coefficients ijL  (Krishna, \n\n2009). Nonetheless, Krishna and Wesselingh (1997) and Skoulidas et al. (2003) have \n\nshown that the three formalisms are equivalent since the coefficients of each formulation \n\ncan be expressed in terms of the coefficients of any of the other two. \n\nAs aforementioned, several diffusion mechanisms can be distinguished within a \n\nporous material. In macro- and mesopores, viscous flow and/or Knudsen diffusion may \n\noccur; in mixtures, bulk or molecular diffusion is an additional mechanism. The Dusty Gas \n\nModel (DGM) (Jackson, 1977; Krishna, 1993) is the most widely used approach to \n\ndescribe combined bulk and Knudsen diffusion. The principle behind the DGM is to \n\nconsider the porous solid as a collection of stationary giant molecules uniformly distributed \n\nin space. Those dust molecules are considered to be a pseudo-species in the \n\nmulticomponent mixture, corresponding to the ( )1+n th component. By combining this \n\n\n\nGas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media \n\n 38 \n\nprinciple with Maxwell-Stefan formulation, the following n  independent equations may be \n\nobtained:  \n\nKni,t\n\ni\n\n1 ijt\n\njiij\ni\n\ni\n\n\u00d0c\nN\n\n\u00d0c\nNxNx\n\n?\nT\n\nx n\n\nij\nj\n\n+\n?\n\n=?\n?\n\n? ?\n?\n=\n\n (III.39)\n\nwhere Kni,\u00d0  is the Knudsen diffusivity, defined as 1n1ni,Kni, ++= x\u00d0\u00d0 , and reflects the \n\nmolecule-wall collisions. In this case, the force exerted on species i  is balanced by the sum \n\nof the friction forces between molecular species i  and j  (bulk diffusion) together with the \n\nfriction between species i  and the solid (Knudsen diffusion). Under the action of a \n\npressure gradient, viscous flow will take place within the pores. Accordingly, the \n\ncontribution from viscous mechanism may be included into the transport equation (Manson \n\nand del Castillo, 1985; Manson and Lonsdale, 1990; Krishna and Wesselingh, 1997): \n\nKni,t\n\ni\n\n1 ijt\n\njiij\n\niM\n\n0\niii\n\ni\nipT,\n\ni '\n\u00d0c\nN\n\n\u00d0c\nNxNx\n\nP\n?\u00d0\nB\n\nx?PV\nT\n\nx\n?\n\nT\nx n\n\nj\n+\n\n?\n=???\n\n?\n??\n\n?\n? ?\n\n=\n\n (III.40)\n\nwhere ipT, ??  is the chemical potential gradient of i at fixed temperature and pressure, 0B  \n\nis the medium permeability, ?  is the mixture viscosity, P?  is the pressure gradient, iV  is \n\nthe partial molar volume of i , and i'?  is the viscous selectivity factor.  \n\nTransport across a composite membrane is a combination of diffusion through both \n\nthe separation top layer and porous support. Because supports are generally macro and/or \n\nmesoporous, transport across them can be accurately described by equation (III.40), since \n\nit embodies the various mechanisms present.  \n\nSurface forces are dominant in microporous structures, where molecules never \n\nescape completely from the surface force field, even at the centre of the pore. By analogy \n\nwith the DGM, diffusion of adsorbed species in micropores may be described assuming the \n\nsurface vacant sites as a ( )1+n th pseudo-species in the multicomponent system. As a \nresult, surface diffusion can be described by (Krishna, 1990,1993; Krishna and \n\nWesselingh, 1997): \n\n\n\nGas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media \n\n 39 \n\ns\nisatp\n\ns\ni\n\n1\ns\nijsatp\n\ns\nji\n\ns\nij\n\ni\ni\n\n\u00d0?q?\nN\n\n\u00d0?q?\nN?N?\n\n?\nT\n? n\n\nij\nj\n\n+\n?\n\n=?\n?\n\n? ?\n?\n=\n\n (III.41)\n\nfor molecules with equal satq , where p?  and ?  are the matrix density and porosity, \n\nrespectively. The chemical potential gradient, i?? , is the driving force for diffusion of \n\nspecies i  along the surface. The first term on the right-hand side represents the friction \n\nexerted on species i  by all the other components in the mixture, while the second term \n\nrepresents friction exerted by the surface on i . Coefficients sij\u00d0  express the interaction \n\nbetween moving components i  and j, in the same way as in bulk diffusion, and si\u00d0 , \n\ndefined as 1n\ns\n\n1ni,\ns\ni ++= ?\u00d0\u00d0 , reflects the molecule-wall interactions.  \n\nSimilarly to the single gas diffusion, si\u00d0  may be dependent on the surface loading. \n\nAssuming that a molecule can migrate from one site to another only when it is empty, a \n\nsimple model to describe the loading dependence is ( )( )n21sisi ...10 ???\u00d0\u00d0 ????= , where \n( )0si\u00d0  is the diffusivity in the limiting case of vanishingly small occupancy (Krishna and \n\nPaschek, 2002; Krishna and Baur, 2004). Concerning sij\u00d0 , these coefficients should exhibit \n\na coverage dependence between si\u00d0  and \ns\nj\u00d0 , which can be determined by the empirical \n\nVignes correlation (Vignes, 1966), adapted to micropores diffusion by Krishna (1990): \n\n( ) ( ) ji\ni\n\nji\n\nj\n\ns\ni\n\ns\nj\n\ns\nij\n\n??\n?\n\n??\n?\n\n\u00d0\u00d0\u00d0 ++=  (III.42)\n\nAssuming equilibrium between the surface and bulk fluid, the surface chemical \n\npotential in equation (III.41) may be expressed in terms of gradients of surface occupancy \n\nby introducing the matrix of thermodynamics factors:  \n\n?\n=\n\n??=?\n?\n\nn\n\nj\n??\n\nT\n?\n\n1\njiji\n\ni , where \nj\n\ni\niij\n\nln\n?\n\nf\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n=?

At low pressures, the \n\ncomponents fugacity may be replaced by the partial pressures, i.e., ii pf = .  \n\n\n\nGas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media \n\n 40 \n\nThe thermodynamic factors, ij? , are calculated based on the isotherms of each \n\ncomponent. Extended Langmuir isotherm is one of the most popular adsorption models for \n\ntwo-component systems. This model usually provides a good data representation when \n\nsaturation loadings of the two components are close. However, when saturation loadings \n\ndiffer significantly, extended Langmuir isotherms may not predict correctly the \n\nequilibrium data, particularly at high occupancies where adsorption of the component with \n\nhigher saturation loading can prevail (van den Broeke et al., 1999c; Kapteijn et al., 2000a; \n\nGavalas, 2008). Dual-site Langmuir (DSL) isotherms have been also adopted in modelling \n\npermeation of single component and binary mixtures, when two different adsorption sites \n\nare distinguished (Krishna et al., 1998; Krishna and Paschek, 2000; Krishna and Baur, \n\n2003; Krishna et al., 2004; Gavalas, 2008). Alternatively, a model based on the ideal \n\nadsorbed solution theory (IAST), developed by Myers and Prausnitz (1965) and Ruthven \n\n(1984) has been also adopted by several authors (e.g., van den Broeke et al. (1999a), \n\nKapteijn et al. (2000a), and Yu et al. (2007)). Similarly to the extended Langmuir \n\nisotherm, the IAST model can be used to predict multicomponent adsorption equilibrium \n\nbased on single gas-adsorption isotherms only (van den Broeke et al., 1999a; Zhu et al., \n\n2006; Gavalas, 2008). Kapteijn et al. (2000a) used the IAST model together with extended \n\nmulticomponent diffusion equations to successfully describe the diffusion in mixtures of \n\nmolecules with  different saturation loadings.  \n\nLangmuir isotherm may be easily extended to describe N-component systems, \n\naccording to the following relation: \n\n \n?\n\n=\n\n+\n== N\n\n1j\njjL,\n\niiL,\n\nsat\n\ni\ni\n\n1 pb\n\npb\nq\nq\n\n?  \n(III.44)\n\nFor the case of Langmuir regime, the thermodynamic factor reduces to: \n\n \n?\n\n=\n\n?\n+= N\n\n1j\nj\n\ni\nijij\n\n1 ?\n\n?\n??  \n\n(III.45)\n\nwhere ij?  is the delta of Kronecker.  \n\n\n\nGas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media \n\n 41 \n\nEquations (III.41) and (III.43) may be combined and expressed in n-dimensional \n\nmatrix form, leading to the final form of Maxwell-Stefan model to describe surface \n\ndiffusion: \n\n( ) [ ] [ ]( )??B?q?N ??= ?1ssatps   (III.46)\n\nbeing the elements of [ ]sB  defined as follows: \n\n?\n?\n=\n\n+=\nn\n\nij\nj \u00d0\n?\n\n\u00d0\nB\n\n1\ns\nij\n\nj\ns\ni\n\ns\nii\n\n1 ,  s\nij\n\nis\nij \u00d0\n\n?\nB ?=    (III.47)\n\nMass transport of multicomponent mixtures may be predicted with Maxwell\u2013Stefan \n\nequations based only on single components adsorption and diffusion data (van den Broeke \n\net al., 1999a; Zhu et al., 2006). However, the individual contribution of each species in the \n\nmixture may differ significantly from its pure behavior, as, for instance, in the case of \n\nbinary mixtures of a strong and weak adsorbable components. Although stronger \n\nadsorbates move slower than the weaker ones, their presence within small pores may create \n\na barrier to the diffusion of the second ones, and hence hinder their transport across the \n\nmembrane. As a result, an unexpected maximum may appear in the uptake profiles of the \n\nfaster diffusing component (van den Broeke et al., 1999a,b; Yang et al., 1999). \n\n \n\n2.3 Adsorption equilibrium  \n\nSeveral models are available in the literature providing appropriate descriptions for single \n\nand multicomponent adsorption equilibrium. For instance, Langmuir, Nitta, Freundlich, \n\nLangmuir-Freundlich, and Toth isotherms are frequently adopted models. In this section \n\ntheir main characteristics and mathematical representation for pure and multicomponent \n\nsystems are presented, along with the temperature dependence of their parameters. \n\nLangmuir theory has been the most widely used approach to describe equilibrium \n\nadsorption data in porous materials. This isotherm is a fundamental equation based on \n\nseveral basic assumptions, namely: i) adsorption on the surface is localized, i.e. molecules \n\nare adsorbed at a fixed number of well-defined localized adsorption sites; ii) each site can \n\n\n\nGas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media \n\n 42 \n\naccommodate only one adsorbate molecule; iii) all sites are energetically equivalent, which \n\nmeans that the surface is homogeneous; and iv) there is no interaction between molecules \n\nadsorbed on neighbouring sites.  \n\nThe Langmuir model was developed based on a kinetic principle, assuming that the \n\nrate of adsorption is equal to the rate of desorption on the surface (Do, 1998). Accordingly, \n\nequation (III.16) may be obtained, which in the low pressure region reduces to the Henry \n\nlaw, and for sufficiently high pressures reaches the saturation capacity characteristic of the \n\nmonolayer coverage. For N-component systems, Langmuir isotherm is: \n\n?\n=\n\n+\n== N\n\nj\npb\n\npb\nq\nq\n\n?\n\n1\njjL,\n\niiL,\n\nsat\n\ni\ni\n\n1\n \n\n(III.48)\n\nFor thermodynamic consistency of the extended Langmuir equation the saturation capacity \n\nof all species must be the same (Broughton, 1948). \n\nThe model of Nitta was derived by Nitta et al. (1984), based on statistical \n\nthermodynamics. This theory provides an extension of the Langmuir isotherm, assuming \n\nlocalized monolayer adsorption on the surface and allowing for multi-site adsorption, \n\nwhere each molecule may be adsorbed on n  active sites (Do, 1998). The Nitta isotherm is \n\ngiven by: \n\n( ) ??\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n=\n\nkT\nu?n\n\n?\n?\n\nPbn n\nN\n\nNN exp1 N\n (III.49)\n\nwhere Nn  is the number of sites occupied by one adsorbed molecule, u  reflects the \n\nadsorbate-adsorbate interaction, and Nb  is the adsorption affinity constant calculated by:  \n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n= 1exp o\no\n\nN\noN T\n\nT\nT\n\nQ\nbb  (III.50)\n\nFor systems where the adsorbate-adsorbate interaction is not as strong as the \n\nadsorbate-adsorbent interaction, 0=u , and equation (III.49) simplifies to: \n\n\n\nGas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media \n\n 43 \n\n( ) N1NN n?\n?\n\nPbn\n?\n\n=  (III.51)\n\nIn this case, Nitta isotherm reduces to the Langmuir equation when 1N =n . \n\nNitta isotherm may be also extended to describe multicomponent systems. When all \n\ninteraction energies between adsorbed molecules are zero, the multicomponent isotherm \n\nequation is simply: \n\niN,N\n\n1j\nj\n\ni\niiN,iN,\n\n1\nn\n\n?\n\n?\npbn\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n=\n\n?\n=\n\n \n(III.52)\n\nSimilarly to the single gas isotherm, when all 1iN, =n , equation (III.52) reduces to the \n\nextended Langmuir equation.  \n\nAdsorbent materials generally exhibit a rather complex pore and surface structure. \n\nConsequently, fundamental adsorption isotherms, such as the classical Langmuir equation \n\nor the Nitta isotherm, may not accurately describe equilibrium. Accordingly, a number of \n\nsemi-empirical approaches have been proposed. In the following, the Freundlich, \n\nLangmuir-Freundlich and Toth isotherm models will be briefly discussed.  \n\nThe Freundlich isotherm is one of the most frequently equations used to describe \n\nequilibria. It may be represented by: \n\n( ) FnPbq /1F=  (III.53)\n\nHere, Fb  and Fn  are temperature-dependent parameters; Fn  usually lies in the range of 1 to \n\n5, and the larger this constant is, the more nonlinear sorption becomes. In general, Fb  \n\ndecreases with temperature, and Fn  approaches unit at high temperatures. \n\nFreundlich isotherm may be adopted for energetically heterogeneous surfaces. \n\nHowever, it is generally valid only in a narrow range of pressure, since it does not exhibit a \n\nproper linear behaviour at low pressures and a finite limit for sufficiently high pressures. \n\nTo overcome the restriction of continuous increase in the concentration of adsorbed \n\n\n\nGas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media \n\n 44 \n\nmolecules, an empirical extension of the Freundlich equation, frequently called Langmuir-\n\nFreundlich isotherm, was proposed by Sips (1948): \n\n( )\n( ) LFn\n\nn\n\nsat Pb\nPb\n\nq\nq\n\n? /1\nLF\n\n/1\nLF\n\n1\n\nLF\n\n+\n==  (III.54)\n\nwhere LFb  is the adsorption affinity constant, and LFn  characterises the surface \n\nheterogeneity. This last parameter is usually greater than unity, and the larger is its value \n\nthe more heterogeneous the system is.  \n\nThe temperature dependence of the Langmuir-Freundlich parameters may be \n\nexpressed as follows: \n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n=?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n= ? 1expexp\n\no\n\no\n\nLF\noLF,\n\nLF\n,LF T\n\nT\nT\n\nQ\nb\n\nT\nQ\n\nbb LF  (III.55)\n\n( )TTnnLF /1 /1/1 oLFoLF, ??+=  (III.56)\n\nwhere ?,LFb  is the adsorption affinity constant at infinite temperature, oLF,b  and oLF,n  are  the \n\nparameters LFb  and LFn  at a reference temperature oT , and LF?  is a constant. The \n\ntemperature dependence of the saturation capacity can be represented by the following \n\nempirical relation: \n\n( )[ ]oLFosat,sat /1  exp TTqq ??=  (III.57)\n\nbeing osat,q  and LF?  the saturation capacity at the reference temperature oT , and a constant \n\nparameter, respectively.  \n\nFor multicomponent systems, equation (III.54) takes the form: \n\n( )\n( )?\n\n=\n\n+\n== N\n\nj\n\nn\nj\n\nn\ni\n\nisat\n\ni\ni\n\njLFpb\n\npb\nq\nq\n\n?\n\n1\n\n/1\njLF,\n\n/1\niLF,\n\n, ,\n\niLF,\n\n1\n (III.58)\n\nLangmuir\u2013Freundlich isotherm combines features of both Langmuir and Freundlich \n\nmodels. Nonetheless, this isotherm still does not follow the expected linear behaviour at \n\n\n\nGas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media \n\n 45 \n\nlow pressures. In contrast, the Toth isotherm, given by equation (III.59), satisfies both low \n\nand high pressure limits: \n\n( )[ ] ttsat Pb\nPb\n\nq\nq\n\n? /1 \nT\n\nT\n\n1  +\n==  (III.59) \n\nwhere Tb  and t  are the Toth isotherm parameters. When 1=t , equation (III.59) reduces to \n\nthe Langmuir equation. Similarly to the Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm, this parameter \n\ncharacterizes the system heterogeneity. The temperature dependence of Tb  and satq  may be \n\nequivalent to those of the Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm (please see equations (III.55) and \n\n(III.56)).  Concerning parameter t , the following empirical relation may be assumed: \n\n( )TTtt /1 oToi ??+=  (III.60)\n\nwhere ot  is the parameter t  at a reference temperature oT , and T?  is a constant.  \n\nSimilarly to the above discussed isotherms, also the Toth equation may be extended \n\nto multicomponent adsorption systems. A number of different approaches have been \n\nproposed in the literature for its multicomponent form, as, for instance, (i) that given by \n\nJaroniec (1984).    \n\n( )\ni\n\ni\n\nt\nN\n\nj\n\ntpb\n\npb\n? 1\n\n1\njjT,\n\niT,i\ni\n\n1 ??\n?\n\n??\n?\n\n+\n=\n\n?\n=\n\n ,  \n\n(III.61) \n\n(ii) the modified Langmuir-Freundlich form adopted by Abdul-Rehman et al.

It is calculated from the single component \n\nisotherms as: \n\n?\n=\n\n=\nN\n\ni\ntyt\n\n1\niiT  (III.64)\n\nbeing iy  the gas molar fraction of i . The saturation capacities of different species in the \n\nextended Toth isotherm should also be the same in order to meet the thermodynamic \n\nconsistency (Lamia et al., 2009).  \n\nThe ideal adsorbed solution (IAS) theory is an alternative approach to describe \n\nmulticomponent adsorption equilibrium, in which the adsorbate mixture is treated as a two-\n\ndimensional solution in equilibrium with a gas phase. Several versions of the IAS theory \n\nhave been proposed, such as the Myers and Prausnitz (1965) theory or the LeVan and \n\nVermeulen (1981) approach for binary systems. This theory is thermodynamically \n\nconsistent and provides an effective technique for estimating the adsorption equilibrium of \n\na gaseous mixture, using uniquely the adsorption isotherms of the pure components.  \n\nThe IAS theory of Myers and Prausnitz adopts the fundamental thermodynamic \n\nequations for liquids to the adsorbed phase. Accordingly, the general equilibrium \n\nrelationship between gaseous and adsorbed phases may be expressed by an equation \n\nanalogous to Raoult\u2019s law for vapour-liquid equilibria:  \n\n( )?= oiii P?Py , for N1,2,...,1 =  \n \n\n(III.65) \n\nwhere iy  and i?  are the molar fractions of component i  in the fluid and adsorbed phases, \n\nrespectively, P  is the total pressure and oiP  is the hypothetical pressure of the pure \n\ncomponent i  that gives the same spreading pressure, ? , as the adsorbed mixture. The \n\nphysical meaning of spreading pressure is analogous to that of a monomolecular film at the \n\n\n\nGas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media \n\n 47 \n\ngas-liquid interface. Thus ?  defines the lowering of the surface tension at the solid-gas \n\ninterface upon adsorption (Yang, 1987). The spreading pressure may be calculated by the \n\nGibbs adsorption isotherm: \n\n( ) ( ) ( )\n? ?? ====?\n\n?\no\n\n2\no\n\nN\no\n\n1\n\n0 0\nN\n\nN\n\nNN\n2\n\n2\n\n22\n\n0\n1\n\n1\n\n11 ...\nP P ooP o\n\ndP\nP\nPq\n\ndP\nP\nPq\n\ndP\nP\nPq\n\nT\nA\n\n \n \n\n(III.66) \n\nwhere A  is the surface area of the adsorbent, and ( )oiPqi  is the isotherm of the pure \ncomponent i  at the hypothetical pressure oiP . The total concentration of adsorbed \n\nmolecules in the mixture, tq , is obtained from:  \n\n( )?==\nN\n\n1j\no\n\njj\n\nj\n\nt\n\n1\nPq\n?\n\nq\n (III.67)\n\nThe previous set of equations can not be solved analytically. In addition, although \n\nbeing widely considered as a simple and convenient tool to calculate multicomponent \n\nadsorption equilibria, the predictability of IAS theory is limited, which may be primarily \n\ndue to the assumption of treating the adsorbed phase as one thermodynamic entity.   \n\nDifferent adsorption models may be found in literature to successfully describe \n\nsingle and binary sorption in zeolites. Barrer (1978) pointed out that the widely adopted \n\nLangmuir isotherm is usually suitable for zeolites, due to compensation effects, even for \n\nmore heterogeneous systems. The dual-site Langmuir (DSL) model has also been used to \n\ndescribe isotherms that deviate from the conventional Langmuir behaviour, being \n\nespecially suitable for fitting the equilibrium data of branched alkanes on silicalite-1 (Zhu \n\net al., 2000). DSL isotherms have been adopted in modelling permeation of single \n\ncomponent and binary mixtures through zeolite membranes, when two different adsorption \n\nsites are distinguished (Krishna et al., 1998; Krishna and Paschek, 2000; Krishna and Baur, \n\n2003; Krishna et al., 2004; Gavalas, 2008).  \n\nAbdul-Rehman et al. (1990) modelled pure and multicomponent equilibrium data for \n\nthe adsorption of the first four n-alkanes on Linde S-115 silicalite using different isotherms \n\nexplicit in partial pressure, namely the loading ratio correlation (Yon and Turnock, 1971), \n\nToth isotherm (Jaroniec, 1984), Mathews and Weber (1980) isotherm, and the statistical \n\n\n\nGas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media \n\n 48 \n\nthermodynamic isotherm of Ruthven (1984). The extended Langmuir equation was found \n\nto describe the adsorption of ethane, methane, and ethane/methane mixture in silicalite-1, \n\neven though the saturation capacities of the single components were different. For \n\npropane/methane mixtures some deviations were found upon predicting mixture adsorption \n\nwith the extended Langmuir equation, being the Toth isotherm the most adequate. Since in \n\nthis case there were no kinks or steps in the mixture adsorption isotherms, which would be \n\nthe case if surface heterogeneity would play a role, the extended Langmuir equation was \n\nconsidered a good approximation. According to the authors, the Toth model gives the best \n\ndescription for the adsorption of the first four alkanes in silicalite-1, for single components \n\nand some binary mixtures. \n\nRees et al. (1991) established a comparison between the Langmuir and the \n\nLangmuir-Freundlich models for the description of pure nitrogen, methane, and carbon \n\ndioxide in silicalite-1. The IAS theory with the Langmuir model for the pure component \n\nisotherms was used to describe the binary adsorption of nitrogen and carbon dioxide. A \n\ngood description was found for the total concentration of adsorbed molecules, though the \n\nIAS predictions for the separation factor deviated significantly from the experimental \n\nresults. A consistent description of the equilibrium adsorption was given by the Nitta \n\nmodel.  \n\nBuss and Heuchel (1997) describe the adsorption of binary mixtures of methane and \n\ntetrafluormethane in silicalite-1 using both the IAS theory, with Toth isotherm for the pure \n\ncomponents, and the binary model of Nitta. Both models were found to provide a good \n\ndescription of the experimental data. The good results obtained were attributed to the high \n\nsurface homogeneity as well as to the channel-like pore geometry of silicalite, where \n\ninteractions between the adsorbate molecules can only occur to a small extent.  \n\nSeidel and Carl (1989) used the Freundlich, Dubinin-Radushkevich, Toth, and \n\nLangmuir-Freundlich isotherms for diffusion of phenol and indole from aqueous solution \n\nin activated carbon. The known simple relationship between surface diffusivity and \n\nadsorption energy proposed by Gilliland et al. (1974) were related to the isotherm on an \n\nenergetically heterogeneous surface. The loading concentration dependence of surface \n\ndiffusivity was calculated for each isotherm equation. The authors concluded that \n\n\n\nGas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media \n\n 49 \n\nisotherms do have a great influence on kinetics. This point is particularly emphasized in \n\nthis thesis, as it will be discussed in section VI.1.   \n\nLi et al. (2007) tested the capability of the Maxwell-Stefan formulation to predict \n\npermeation fluxes of CO2/CH4, CO2/N2, and N2/CH4 mixtures across a SAPO-34 \n\nmembrane using only data of pure-component adsorption isotherms and diffusivities. The \n\nauthors concluded that for adsorption of pure gases in zeolite structures with cages \n\nseparated by narrow windows, such as SAPO-34, the model based on statistical \n\nthermodynamics described by Ruthven (1984) may be particularly relevant. The mixture \n\nthermodynamics was estimated using the IAS theory of Myers and Prausnitz (1965).  \n\n\n\nModelling Ion Exchange in Microporous Titanosilicates \n\n 51 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIV. Modelling Ion Exchange in Microporous \nTitanosilicates \n\n \n\nThis chapter focuses the modelling of ion exchange in microporous titanosilicates based on \n\nthe Maxwell-Stefan equations. First, a brief overview of the more classical kinetic models \n\nwill be presented. Then, a more detailed description around the Nernst-Planck equations \n\nwill be given. Finally, a detailed model based on the Maxwell-Stefan formulation will be \n\ndeveloped to describe a batch ion exchange in microporous materials. The model equations \n\nwill be solved numerically in order to fit and predict experimental data from literature. The \n\ncases studied to validate the proposed model consist in mercury (II) and cadmium (II) \n\nremoval from aqueous solution using ETS-4 microporous titanosilicate. The capability of \n\nthe proposed model to describe experimental data and its predictive capacity will be \n\ncompared with those of the Nernst-Planck model, given its sound theoretical fundaments. \n\nTo conclude, results obtained with the more frequently applied pseudo first- and pseudo \n\nsecond-order kinetic equations will be presented as well.  \n\n \n\n1. Introduction \n\nToxic metals are well known by their toxicology and tendency to accumulate in the living \n\norganisms and aquatic systems, causing serious diseases and disorders. They are mainly \n\ndischarged into the aquatic system as industrial wastewaters, mainly from metal finishing, \n\nwelding, alloy manufacturing plants, pulp industries and petroleum refining, endangering \n\nsoil and water quality (Inglezakis et al., 2002). Mercury and cadmium are two of the most \n\n\n\nModelling Ion Exchange in Microporous Titanosilicates \n\n 52 \n\ntoxic non-essential metals present in the environment, even at low concentrations, and their \n\npersistence in the aquatic systems encourages the development of techniques to remove \n\nthem. Ion exchange is probably one of the most attractive processes, being commonly used \n\nin industry because of its simple and efficient application. This technique is effective to \n\nremove even traces from solutions and is particularly useful for treating large volumes of \n\ndilute solutions (Dabrowski et al., 2004). Natural and synthetic zeolites are gaining \n\nconsiderable interest as ion-exchangers because of their high selectivity and capacity \n\n(Biskup and Subotic, 2004; Ahmed et al., 2006; Trgo et al., 2006a). A number of \n\ntitanosilicates have recently been used as ion exchangers for toxic metals removal. For \n\ninstance, ETS-10 has been shown to have high selectivity for several toxic metals such as \n\nPb2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Mn2+, Zn2+ (Choi et al., 2006; Lv et al., 2007; Camarinha et al., \n\n2009) and some radiocations (Pavel et al., 2003). Moreover, Bortun et al. (1997) evaluated \n\nframework and layered titanosilicates for cesium and strontium uptake from contaminated \n\ngroundwater and wastewater; Decaillon et al. (2002) studied the ion exchange selectivity \n\nof layered titanosilicate AM-4 toward strontium; Koudsi and Dyer (2001) studied a \n\nsynthetic titanosilicate analog of the mineral penkvilsite-2O, i.e. AM-3, for removal of \n\nCobalt-60; and Lopes et al. (2007,2009) evaluated the potential of synthetic microporous \n\n(ETS-4, ETS-10, and AM-2) and layered (AM-4) titanosilicates for decontamination of \n\nnatural waters polluted with low mercury levels. These results induced us to develop in this \n\nthesis a Maxwell-Stefan formulation for the ion exchange fluxes in microporous \n\ntitanosilicates. \n\nAs stated in Chapter II, microporous titanosilicates are crystalline solids with a well \n\ndefined structure formed by a three-dimensional combination of tetrahedral and octahedral \n\nbuilding blocks. Each TiO6 octahedron in the titanosilicate global structure carries a -2 \n\ncharge, which can be neutralized by extra-framework cations (usually Na+ and K+). These \n\ncompensation species, as well as water molecules or other adsorbed molecules, are located \n\nin the channels of the structure and can be replaced by others (e.g., Hg2+ and Cd2+). The \n\nframework anionic sites are typically divalent, which should be particularly useful for the \n\nexchange of divalent ions.  \n\nModelling and simulation are useful tools to study and design a chemical plant. It is \n\nfundamental to be able to predict the dynamic behaviour of any unit, optimize their \n\n\n\nModelling Ion Exchange in Microporous Titanosilicates \n\n 53 \n\noperating conditions, and scale up from laboratory to large scale. Such goals may be \n\naccomplished by computer simulation in order to reduce the number of indispensable \n\nexperiments. The validity of a model is not only the result of a good fitting but also its \n\nability to predict the behaviour of a process under operating conditions apart from those \n\nused to obtain its parameters. Such principle guided the development of our model. \n\n \n\n2. Classical Models \n\nThe kinetic performance of an ion exchange process is frequently interpreted by \n\nsemiempirical pseudo first- and second-order equations (Namasivayam and Senthilkumar, \n\n1998; Ho and McKay, 1999a,b; Reddad et al., 2002; Chiron et al., 2003; Yardim et al., \n\n2003; Aksu, 2005; Zhang et al., 2005; Lopes et al., 2007; Lopes et al., 2009)). However, \n\nsuch models have no theoretical background, which limits their application and \n\nextrapolation \n\nMass transport in dilute ionic systems can be effectively described by the Nernst-\n\nPlanck (NP) equations (Smith and Dranoff, 1964; Chanda and Rempel, 1995; Dolgonosov \n\net al., 1995; Patzay, 1995; Rodriguez et al., 1998; Samson and Marchand, 1999; Varshney \n\nand Pandith, 1999; Rodriguez et al., 2002; Varshney et al., 2003; Valverde et al., \n\n2004,2005; Cincotti et al., 2006). In an electrolyte solution, the electrical field induced by \n\nthe different mobility of counter ions produces an additional force responsible for the \n\ntransference of ions. The Nernst-Planck Equations account for both concentration and \n\nelectric potential gradients. However, according to this model, the interdiffusion \n\ncoefficients of counter ions are composition-dependent and the ionic interactions (ion-ion, \n\nion-solvent, and ion-ion exchanger) are lumped into effective diffusivities (Helfferich, \n\n1995). Furthermore, Nernst-Planck does not take non-ideality effects and the pressure \n\ngradient into account (Helfferich, 1995; Wesselingh et al., 1995).  \n\nSome authors represent experimental data with analytical models devised specifically \n\nfor particle diffusion control or film diffusion control under well defined conditions, as for \n\ninstance infinite solution volume or constant diffusion rate and radial diffusion coefficient. \n\n\n\nModelling Ion Exchange in Microporous Titanosilicates \n\n 54 \n\nHowever, such conditions generally never hold in practice (Liberti et al., 1978; Helfferich, \n\n1995; Trgo et al., 2006a,b). For this reason, such models will be not included in this study. \n\n \n\n2.1 Pseudo-first order model \n\nThe pseudo-first order rate equation of Lagergren (1898) is one of the most widely used \n\nkinetic models to express the ion exchange mechanism. The Lagergren equation was the \n\nfirst rate equation for sorption of liquid/solid system based on the solid capacity. It may be \n\nrepresented by: \n\n( )qqk\ndt\ndq\n\n?= e1  (IV.1)\n\nwhere 1k  is the rate constant of the first order sorption, eq  is the sorbed solute \n\nconcentration at equilibrium, and q  is the concentration at any time t . Integrating \n\nequation (IV.1) for 0=t  to tt = , and 0=q  to qq = , and rearranging to get a linear form, \n\none obtains:    \n\n( ) ( ) ktqqq ?=? ee lnln  (IV.2)\n\nIn order to fit equation (IV.2) to experimental data, the equilibrium sorption capacity, eq , \n\nmust be known. The constant 1k  can be determined by plotting ( )qq ?eln  versus t . The \n\nparameter ( )eln q  is expected to be equal to the intercept of the ( )qq ?eln  vs t  \nrepresentation; however, this is often not the case. \n\n \n\n2.2 Pseudo-second order model \n\nThe pseudo-second order rate equation is also based on the sorption capacity of the solid \n\nand can be written as: \n\n\n\nModelling Ion Exchange in Microporous Titanosilicates \n\n 55 \n\n( )2e2 qqkdt\ndq\n\n?=  (IV.3)\n\nwhere  2k  is the rate constant of the second order sorption. Integrating equation (IV.3) for \n\nthe previous boundary conditions, and rearranging in a linear form, it can be expressed as: \n\nt\nqqkq\n\nt\n\ne\n2\ne2\n\n11\n+=  (IV.4)\n\nIn this case, 2k  can be determined by plotting qt  versus t . \n\n \n\n2.3 Nernst-Planck based model \n\nIon exchange is a stoichiometric process in which an ion from a solution is replaced by an \n\nequivalent amount, in terms of electrical charges, of another ionic species from a solid \n\nphase. This process may be represented by conventional chemical equilibrium between two \n\ncounter ions (Helfferich, 1995). For the case where the zeolite is initially in B form and the \n\ncounter ion in solution is A, the reaction is: \n\nBAAB z\nA\n\nz\nB\n\nz\nB\n\nz\nA BzAzAzBz +?+  (IV.5)\n\nwhere Az  and Bz  are the electrochemical valences, and the upper bars identify the solid \n\nphase.  \n\nAn electric field in an electrolyte solution, caused by the different mobilities of \n\ncounter ions, produces an additional force responsible for the transference of ions. In \n\ncontrast to the classical Fick\u2019s law, the Nernst-Planck model does account for the influence \n\nof this electric field. Hence, the flux of each counter ion in dilute ionic solutions may be \n\ndescribed by the Nernst-Planck equations (Helfferich, 1995): \n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n??\n\n?\n??\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?=\nrT\n\nF\nqzD\n\nr\nq\n\nDN AAA\nA\n\nAA  (IV.6)\n\n\n\nModelling Ion Exchange in Microporous Titanosilicates \n\n 56 \n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n??\n\n?\n??\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?=\nrT\n\nF\nqzD\n\nr\nq\n\nDN BBB\nB\n\nBB .

Maxwell-Stefan Formulation \n\nAn alternative approach to describe an ion exchange process deals with the application of \n\nthe Maxwell-Stefan (MS) equations, due to their well documented advantages in mass \n\ntransport (Krishna, 1990,1993; Krishna and Wesselingh, 1997) (see detailed description in \n\nChapter III). However, in the case of porous structures, such formulation has been \n\nessentially applied to non-ionic systems, particularly in gas phase (van de Graaf et al., \n\n1999; Kapteijn et al., 2000a). In the last years, some papers concentrate on the application \n\nof MS theory to mass transfer in membrane electrolysis process (e.g., van der Stegen \n\n(1999) and Hogendoorn et al. (2001)) and electrodialysis (Kraaijeveld et al., 1995). The \n\nMS equations do take into account and distinguish both ion-ion and ion-solid interactions, \n\nand they have been proved to be more effective in predicting ion exchange than the above \n\nmentioned Nernst-Planck relationships (Graham and Dranoff, 1982a,b; Pinto and Graham, \n\n1987; Wesselingh et al., 1995). Furthermore, under the scope of MS formalism, one \n\ndiffusivity coefficient is defined for each pair of components, being dependent on their \n\nproperties only. In addition, these coefficients are only weakly dependent on composition. \n\n \n\n3.1 Maxwell-Stefan based model \n\nIn this section, the intraparticle resistance to ion exchange in microporous materials is \n\ndescribed using the generalized MS equations (e.g., Krishna and Wesselingh (1997)) \n\nsubjected to the following assumptions: i) Surface diffusion is the only transport \n\nmechanism, since due to the very small pore diameters ions never escape from the force \n\nfield of the matrix co-ions, mainly due to the strong and long range nature of the \n\nelectrostatic interactions. ii) The solid matrix is considered to be a uniform distribution of \n\nfixed ionic charges corresponding to the ( )1+n th component, through which counter ions \ndiffuse. Therefore, 01 =+nu , as in the well known Dusty Gas Model (Jackson, 1977; \n\nKrishna and Wesselingh, 1997), already described in Chapter III.   \n\nConsidering the abovementioned assumptions, the MS transport equation for species \n\ni  in multicomponent ionic systems is: \n\n\n\nModelling Ion Exchange in Microporous Titanosilicates \n\n 58 \n\nis\n\nis\n\n1 ij\n\njij\nii\n\n)(\n\u00d0\n\nTuy\n\u00d0\n\nuuTy\nFz\n\nn\n\nij\nj\n\n?\n+\n\n??\n=???? ?\n\n?\n=\n\n??  \n(IV.13)\n\n \n\nwhere i??  is the surface chemical potential gradient of i , iz  is the charge of component i\n\n, ij\u00d0  is the common MS surface diffusivity of pair ji - , is\u00d0  is the MS surface diffusivity \n\ncorresponding to the interaction between i  and the fixed ionic charges (subscript s  stands \n\nfor solid), tjj qqy =  is molar fraction of counter ion j , ts qQy =  is molar fraction of \n\nfixed charged groups, jq  is the molar concentration of j , and tq  is the total concentration \n\nof ionic species. It should be noted that ?\n+\n\n=\n\n=\n1\n\n1\ni 1\n\nn\n\ni\ny , and tq  is not constant whenever counter \n\nions have different electrochemical valences. Taking into account the definition of molar \n\nflux of the ionic species j , \n\njjtj uyqN =  (IV.14)\n\nequation (IV.13) may be recast as:  \n\nist\n\nis\n\n1 ijt\n\njiij\niii\n\ni\n\n\u00d0q\nNy\n\n\u00d0q\nNyNy\n\n?\nT\n\nF\nzy?\n\nT\ny n\n\nij\nj\n\n+\n?\n\n=?\n?\n\n??\n?\n\n? ?\n?\n=\n\n (IV.15)\n\nAssuming equilibrium between exchanger and bulk solution, (i.e., soli,i ?? = ), i??  can be \n\nexpressed in terms of the molar fraction gradients of counter ions in the particle by: \n\n?\n=\n\n??=?\n?\n\nn\n\nj\ny?\n\nT\ny\n\n1\njiji\n\ni ,  with \n( )\n\nj\n\nisoli,\niij\n\nln\ny\n\nx\ny\n\n?\n??\n\n??

It is worth noting that in equation (IV.16) \n\nix  and iy  are related by equilibrium isotherm (e.g., equation (IV.34) below). \n\n\n\nModelling Ion Exchange in Microporous Titanosilicates \n\n 59 \n\nEquation (IV.15) can be expressed in n-dimensional matrix notation.

Hence, the equations available are: one MS equation \n\n(equation (IV.18)), the bootstrap relation (equation (IV.23)), and the no current restriction \n\n(equation (IV.22)).

The thermodynamic factors simplify, since the activity coefficients \ncalculated were very nearly unitary. \n\n \n\n3.2 Material balances, initial and boundary conditions, and equilibrium isotherms \n\nThe models developed to describe batch ion exchange embody the following hypothesis: i) \n\nthere exist film and intraparticle mass transfer resistances; ii) spherical solid particles; iii) \n\nperfectly stirred tank; iv) isothermal operation; v) liquid and solid volume changes are \n\nneglected; (vi) co-ions are excluded from the zeolite particles (Donnan exclusion); (vii) \n\neffect of competitive ions (e.g. H+) is neglected and (viii) ideal solution. Concerning \n\ndiffusing components, A  is the pollutant to remove from solution, Hg2+ or Cd2+, using the \n\nion-exchanger (ETS-4) initially in B \u2013 form (Na+).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nModelling Ion Exchange in Microporous Titanosilicates \n\n 61 \n\nMaterial Balances and initial and boundary conditions \n\nConsidering the above assumptions, the mass balances in the particle and in the reservoir \n\nare: \n\n( )AA Nrrrt\nq 2\n\n2\n\n1\n?\n?\n\n?=?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n (IV.26)\n\ndt\nqd\n\nV\nV\n\ndt\nCd A\n\nL\n\nsA ?= .

(IV.28)\n\nThe variables R , sV , and LV  represent particle radius, volume of solid phase, and volume \n\nof fluid phase, respectively.  \n\nThe following initial and boundary conditions are used. The initial conditions (no B \n\nin solution, no A in zeolite) are: \n\n?\n?\n?\n\n=\n==\n\n=\n0,\n\n0\n           , 0\n\nAA\n\nAA\n\nCC\nqq\n\nt  (IV.29)\n\nand the boundary conditions are the interface concentration and the null central flux \n\ncondition: \n\nRr = ,                  RAA qq ,=   (IV.30)\n\n0=r ,      0=?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\nr\nq A  . (IV.31)\n\nThe concentration at the interface is uniquely determined by equalizing internal diffusion \n\nand film convection fluxes, i.e.: \n\n\n\nModelling Ion Exchange in Microporous Titanosilicates \n\n 62 \n\n( )RAAfRrA CCkAAN ,?==  (IV.32)\n\nwhere fk  is the convective mass transfer coefficient, and A  is the external particle surface \n\narea. For well established agitated systems, it is possible to estimate fk  using correlations \n\nwhich depend generally on the Reynolds, Schmidt and Power numbers,  and on \n\ngeometrical parameters such as the ratio of impeller to tank diameter, the specific geometry \n\nof the impeller, and the geometry of baffling, if any, used to inhibit vortex formation in the \n\nvessel. Several correlations and more references may be found elsewhere (Treybal, 1981; \n\nMisic et al., 1982; Kulov et al., 1983; Miller et al., 1984; Slater, 1991).  \n\nThe correlation of Armenante and Kirwan (1989) may be used to estimate the \n\nconvective mass transfer coefficient, at least to predict its order of magnitude, due to its \n\nsimplicity and because it was specifically derived for microparticles in agitated systems:   \n\n1/30.52 Sc0.52Re2hS +=  (IV.33)\n\nwhere \nAwpf\n\nDdkSh =  is the Sherwood number, pd  is the particle diameter, AwD  is the \n\ndiffusivity of the solute in solution, ?? 3/43/1 pdRe =  is the Reynolds number, ?  is the \n\nmixer power input per unit of fluid mass, ?  is the kinematic viscosity, and AwDSc ?=  is \n\nthe Schmidt number. This equation is frequently applied to fix fk  in the model equations \n\nor, alternatively, to estimate fk  and compare it with the optimized value from \n\nexperimental data (Fernandez and Carta, 1996; Bhattacharya, 2007).  \n\n \n\nEquilibrium Isotherms \n\nIn order to describe the system behavior, both kinetics and adsorption equilibrium have to \n\nbe simultaneously taken into account. The equilibrium between bulk solution and ion-\n\nexchanger were evaluated in this work using the Freundlich isotherm, given the good \n\nequilibrium representation achieved. Freundlich isotherm can be represented by: \n\nF/1 n\nAFA CKq =  (IV.34)\n\n\n\nModelling Ion Exchange in Microporous Titanosilicates \n\n 63 \n\nHere, FK  and Fn  are temperature-dependent parameters; Fn  usually lies in the range of 1 \n\nto 5, and the larger this constant is, the more nonlinear sorption becomes. In general,  FK  \n\ndecreases with temperature, and Fn  approaches unit at high temperatures (Do, 1998).   \n\n \n\n3.3 Solution approach: numerical methods used \n\nThe simultaneous solution of the set of differential and algebraic equations listed above \n\ngives the concentration of counter ions in the fluid, and their concentration profiles in the \n\nsolid phase as function of position and time. The model has been solved numerically using \n\nthe Method of Lines (Schiesser, 1991) and integrated by the finite-difference approach. For \n\nthat purpose, a program in Matlab has been written to solve the resulting Ordinary \n\nDifferential Equations (ODEs) with 101 grid points and finite-difference approach with \n\ncentral differences of second order; forward and backward differences formulas were \n\nadopted for the first and last nodes, respectively. The average loading per unit particle \n\nvolume (equation (IV.28)) is numerically evaluated using the 1/3 Simpson\u2019s Rule. Ode15s \n\nhas been used to integrate this set of ODEs of the initial-value type. \n\nThe self-diffusion coefficients and the convective mass transfer coefficient are the \n\nmodel parameters to fit to the experimental data. Accordingly, a first optimization step was \n\nperformed based on the \u2018elimination of linear parameters in nonlinear regression\u2019 \n\ntechnique due to Lawton and Sylvestre (1971). With this procedure, a reduction of the \n\nnumber of parameters that must be estimated by the iterative procedure is achieved, as well \n\nas faster convergence attained. Finally, an enhancing optimization involving all parameters \n\nsimultaneously was performed, where the results previously obtained from the above \n\nmentioned technique were taken as reliable initial guesses.  \n\n \n\n3.4 Data used to validate MS based model \n\nThe validity of the proposed model was examined using experimental data measured in the \n\nUniversity of Aveiro, concerning batch experiments where mercury (II) and cadmium (II) \n\nions are removed from aqueous solution using ETS-4 microporous titanosilicate (Ferreira \n\n\n\nModelling Ion Exchange in Microporous Titanosilicates \n\n 64 \n\net al., 2009; Lopes et al., 2009). Totally, eight experiments are considered, corresponding \n\nto the conditions listed in Table IV.1 and Table IV.2. In those works the bulk concentration \n\nof Hg2+ and Cd2+ has been measured along time.

Discussion \n\nResults obtained with the MS based model proposed in this work are shown in Figures \n\nIV.1 and IV.2, plotted in 0)( AA CtC  versus time and ( )tqA  versus time forms, along with \nexperimental data. Table IV.4 displays the calculated parameters, namely MS diffusivities \n\nand film mass transfer coefficient optimized, and the average absolute relative deviations \n\n( )AARD  found. The figures point out the good agreement between model results and \nexperiments of Tables IV.1 and IV.2, confirmed by the low deviations found, \n\n%49.5=AARD  and %41.6=AARD , respectively, which are well inside the experimental \n\naccuracy reported (5-8%). The accurate correlation accomplished in the transition from \n\nsteep descent to horizontal branch is noteworthy in both cases, once in liquid-solid sorbent \n\nprocesses the elbow of the kinetic curves is frequently most difficult to fit.  \n\nThe diffusion coefficients fitted (Table IV.4) are in the order of 1820 1010 ?? ?  m2s-1, \n\nwhich are consistent with both the small pore diameters of ETS-4 (0.3-0.4 nm), and the \n\nstrong and long range nature of the electrostatic interactions, following other values in \n\nliterature. For instance, Barrer and Rees (1960) reported self-diffusion coefficients of \n\n1.14\u00d710-17, 1.96\u00d710-21, and 8.27\u00d710-26 m2s-1 for Na+, K+ and Rb+ in analcite, repectively; \n\napparent diffusion coefficients of 17108.1 ?\u00d7  and 18100.8 ?\u00d7  m2s-1 were obtained by Coker \n\nand Rees (2005) for Ca2+ and Mg2+ in semi-crystalline zeolite Na-A, respectively; Brooke \n\nand Rees (1969) reported interdiffusion diffusivities in the range of 1918 1010 ?? ?  m2s-1 for \n\nthe system Na+/K+ in shabazite; and Coker and Rees (1992) reported interdiffusion \n\ncoefficients of 181000.2 ?\u00d7  and 181053.6 ?\u00d7  m2s-1 for Na+/Ca2+ and Na+/Mg2+ in \n\nberyllophosphate. Ahmed et al. (2006) published an estimated Cd2+ apparent diffusion \n\ncoefficient of 231084.2 ?\u00d7 m2s-1 in CaX zeolite, based on an intraparticle diffusion model \n\nneglecting external diffusion resistances. However, the simulation achieved with such \n\ncoefficient was comparatively poor relatively to that obtained by simply fitting a first-order \n\nkinetic model to the experimental data.  \n\n \n\n\n\nModelling Ion Exchange in Microporous Titanosilicates \n\n 66 \n\nFigure IV.1 \u2013 Plot of the normalized concentration of cation in the bulk solution versus \ntime: modelling and experimental data for (a) Hg2+ removal; experimental conditions (see \nTable IV.1): ?, Exp.1; ?, Exp.2; ? *, Exp.3 and ?, Exp.4; and (b) Cd2+ removal; \nexperimental conditions (see Table IV.2): ?, Exp.5; *, Exp.6; ?, Exp.7 and ?

Moreover, a relative inaccuracy associated with determination of such \n\ncoefficients is frequently found in literature.

This is a reliable result \n\nsince some parameters used in the correlation were not entirely appropriate for the specific \n\nexperimental set-up, namely, the power was approximately calculated, and the size of \n\nETS-4 particles ( 6p 107.0\n?\u00d7=d m) is one order of magnitude lower than the inferior limit \n\nstudied by Armenante and Kirwan (range of ( ) 6p 104206 ?\u00d7?=d m). \n\nIn Figure IV.3 the normalized concentration of mercury (II) in ETS-4 is graphed as \n\nfunction of time and radial position, for Experiment 2 of Table IV.1.

This plot confirms expected trends, nonetheless it is \n\ninteresting to detach the time evolution of normalized concentration at surface, \n\n( ) eqAA qRrtq ,; = . As Figure IV.3 illustrates, initial sudden rise of surface concentration is \n\nso pronounced that it goes through a maximum and than decreases gradually until \n\nequilibrium is reached.

With that purpose, the parameters involved ( As\u00d0 , Bs\u00d0 , AB\u00d0 , fk ) were optimized \n\nusing one set of experimental data independently (namely, Exp.4 and Exp.7, for mercury \n\nand cadmium experiments, respectively). Afterwards the remaining curves were predicted \n\nwith those parameters. The results obtained may be found in Table IV.5, and demonstrate \n\nthe model is able to predict ion exchange behaviour for different experimental conditions. \n\nPlease verify the moderate increments of the AARDs when we go from correlation to \n\nprediction: %29.621.6 ?=AARD  and %96.670.6 ?=AARD , for Hg2+ and Cd2+ \n\nremoval data, respectively.

Final remarks  \n\nIn this chapter a model based on the Maxwell-Stefan formulation has been developed to \n\ndescribe ion exchange in microporous materials. The MS approach has been adopted due \n\nto their well documented advantages over Nernst-Planck relationships, particularly because \n\nit takes account of ion-ion and ion-solid. The model accounts for external (film) and \n\nintraparticle diffusion control; their parameters are the MS diffusivities of each pair of \n\nspecies (counter ions and fixed charges of the particle) and the film mass transfer \n\ncoefficient. \n\nThe model was validated with batch experiments on mercury (II) and cadmium (II) \n\nremoval from aqueous solution using ETS-4 microporous titanosilicate (pore diameters \n\nbetween 0.3-0.4 nm). In this case the relevant species are Hg2+ or Cd2+ and Na+ (initially in \n\nsolution and in ETS-4, respectively), and titanosilicate ionic fixed charges. Results \n\nobtained provide good representations of metal ions concentration in solution and solid \n\nphase along time. Even the transition from the steep descent to the horizontal branch of \n\n0AA CC  versus time curve is well represented, precisely where kinetic curves are most \n\ndifficult to fit.  \n\nThe predicting ability of the MS based model was analyzed, being possible to \n\nconclude it exhibits good predictive capacity. In effect, good predictions are accomplished \n\nwith parameters optimized from an independent set of data. Such performance may be \n\nattributed to the sound physical principles of Maxwell-Stefan theory. \n\nA comparison between Nernst-Planck and Maxwell-Stefan based models has been \n\naccomplished. The results obtained reveal that both models provide similar data \n\nrepresentation, as well as fine predictive capability. The advantageous of the Maxwell-\n\nStefan description, which arise particularly from taking into account ion-ion and ion-solid \n\ninteractions, are not distinguished in this comparison. Such result can be ascribed to the \n\nexperimental conditions used, namely dilute ionic solutions and binary exchange. \n\nAlthough, in principle, it is expected theoretically that these models will behave differently \n\nin concentrated solutions and in multicomponent systems; Nernst-Planck equations lump \n\nionic interactions (ion-ion, ion-solvent, and ion-ion exchanger) into effective diffusivities \n\nand are not able to take non-ideality effects into account.  \n\n\n\nModelling Ion Exchange in Microporous Titanosilicates \n\n 76 \n\nA research team at University of Aveiro is carrying out new experiments to study ion \n\nexchange in more concentrated solutions as well as competition effects with \n\nmulticomponent mixtures and titanosilicates. Accordingly, it will be interesting to validate \n\nthe performance of the proposed MS based model for simultaneous Hg2+ and Cd2+ ion \n\nexchange, and analyze its behaviour for concentrated solutions, where the Nernst-Planck \n\nmodel is expected to fail. \n\n\n\nExperimental Section \n\n 77 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nV. Experimental Section \n \n\nThe study of membranes permeation properties is fundamental for their characterization. \n\nMembrane quality should be assessed by measuring permeances of individual gases as well \n\nas separation factors of mixtures.  \n\nThe permeation of certain molecules, at room temperature, can be used to detect \n\nrough defects in the membrane structure since over enhanced fluxes denunciate the \n\npresence of defects. The ideal selectivity, calculated as the ratio between the corresponding \n\nindividual permeances, could give an idea of the membrane quality as well: ideal \n\nselectivities close to the Knudsen value (equal to the square root of molecular weighs ratio \n\ninverse) evidence meso-defects since in mesoporous systems Knudsen diffusion is the \n\ndominant transport mechanism. Moreover, the behaviour of permeation flux with \n\ntemperature or pressure allows the discrimination between the different transport \n\nmechanisms involved and the subsequent detection of defects. Finally, the separation of \n\nreal mixtures allows a real investigation of the membrane performance.   \n\nIn the present work, gases with different molecular dimensions were selected in order \n\nto study transport through the micropores. For that purpose, an experimental set-up was \n\ndesigned, assembled and tested to carry out permeation experiments with single gases and \n\nmixtures at fixed and programmed temperature, under several transmembrane pressure \n\ndifferences. This chapter describes in detail the experimental set-up and procedures \n\nadopted for the dynamic characterization of membranes.  \n\n\n\nExperimental Section \n\n 78 \n\n1. Experimental set-up \n\nAn experimental set-up was designed and assembled in order to carry out single gas \n\npermeation measurements as well as mixture separations. Figure V.1 shows some pictures \n\nof the experimental apparatus, which consists essentially of:  \n\n(i) a stainless-steel membrane module (manufactured at the University of Aveiro) used \n\nto accommodate the membrane (see Figure V.1a);  \n\n(ii) a tubular electric oven (manufactured at the University of Aveiro) coupled with a \n\nPID temperature controller (TC) (Eurotherm, Type 818) which allows the \n\nregulation of temperature and heating rate; a double thermocouple (Omega, Type \n\nK, CASS-IM15U-300-DUAL) is introduced inside the membrane and \n\nsimultaneously connected to the temperature controller and to a data acquisition \n\nsystem (see Figure V.1c); \n\n(iii) three mass flow controllers (MFC) (ALicat, MC-500SCCM-D/5M) used to control \n\nthe mass flow of feed and sweep gases (Figure V.1b);  \n\n(iv) a mass flow meter (MFM) (ALicat, M-500SCCM-D) used to measure the permeate \n\nflow (see Figure V.1b);  \n\n(v) a back pressure regulator (BPR) (ALicat, PC-100PSIG-D/5P) used to measure and \n\nregulate the pressure at the retentate side, controlling in this way the \n\ntransmembrane pressure difference (see Figure V.1b);  \n\n(vi) a pressure transducer (PT) (ALicat, P-100PSIG-D), placed before the MFM, to \n\nmeasure the permeate pressure (see Figure V.1b); \n\n(vii) 16 electric solenoid valves (V1\u2013V16) (Mega Control) to open and close the gas \n\nlines of the experimental set-up; gases are fed to the system and flow through the \n\nset-up in 1/4\u201d and 1/8\u201d stainless-steel and polypropylene tubing (see Figure V.1b);  \n\n(viii) a gas detector (GD) (Oldham MX 2100), essential to detect any gas leakage when \n\ninflammable or toxic gases are studied. In this case, a fan is also used to support \n\nefficient ventilation near the equipments (see Figure V.1c). \n\n\n\nExperimental Section \n\n 79 \n\n(ix) a gas chromatograph (GC) (DANI 1000 DPC), with a thermal conductivity detector \n\n(TCD), equipped with two separation capillary columns: a ValcoPLOT Molesieve \n\n0.5\u00d730 5A column for permanent gases, and a ValcoPLOT HayeSep D 0.5\u00d730 \n\ncolumn for CO2 separation (see Figure V.1d). \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\nFigure V.1 \u2013 Experimental set-up used for permeation measurements. a) membrane \nmodule; b) 1 \u2013 mass flow controller (MFC), 2 \u2013 back pressure regulator (BPR), 3 \u2013 mass \nflow meter (MFM), 4 \u2013 pressure transducer (PT); c) 5 \u2013 thermocouple, 6 \u2013temperature \ncontroller (TC), 7 \u2013 gas detector (GD), 8 \u2013 electric oven; d) gas chromatograph. \n \n\nA graphical interface was developed using the LabVIEW software (National \n\nInstruments) in order to exchange information with the experimental set-up, i.e., to \n\nsend/get information to/from the several set-up components. The RS-485 communication \n\nprotocol was used for that purpose.

The \n\ngas to be tested is selected also acting directly from PC by opening the corresponding \n\nvalves (see Figure V.3). The temperature and heating rate, on the other hand, can be only \n\nadjusted on the temperature controller. Feed and permeate flow rates, retentate and \n\npermeate pressures, and temperature are continually recorded and displayed in the \n\ncomputer during experiments; the evolution of such parameters is also shown in a \n\ngraphical form (see Figure V.3). All data measured can be collected at the end of the runs \n\nand saved into a spreadsheet file.  \n\n \n\nCalibrations \n\nIn order to control the operating conditions directly from the computer, all the measuring \n\ndevices had to be previously calibrated. Concerning the mass flow controllers and mass \n\nflow meter, a distinct calibration was carried out for each gas. For that purpose, fixed flow \n\nrates were imposed directly on the MFCs display, where the studied gas was previously \n\nselected, and the corresponding voltage was registered by the LabVIEW software. This \n\nprocedure was repeated for different flow rates covering all the operating range of the \n\nequipments. The MFM was calibrated after connecting the feed stream directly to the \n\nMFM, by fixing several flow rates of each gas directly on a MFC and reading the MFM \n\nvoltage on the computer. The response signal of the pressure and temperature measuring \n\ndevices is independent of the selected gas. Accordingly, BPR and PT calibrations were \n\nperformed using only N2. The BPR was calibrated imposing several N2 flow rates on a \n\nMFC, and relating the pressure read on the BPR display with the voltage exhibited on the \n\ncomputer. A similar procedure was adopted for the PT, which was calibrated with respect \n\nto the BPR. Finally, the thermocouple was calibrated using the temperature controller as \n\nreference.  \n\nTable IV.1 compiles the calibration equations for each instrument.

The composition of each component was then related with the corresponding \n\narea of the chromatogram peaks. The chromatograms acquisition and their mathematical \n\ntreatment were carried using the DataApex Clarity software for windows. \n\nFigure V.5 shows a chromatogram obtained for a binary CO2/N2 mixture, together \n\nwith the resulting peak areas. A graphical representation for CO2 calibration data is \n\npictured in Figure V.6 as an example to illustrate the calibration procedure. As shown in \n\nthis figure, the resulting calibration equation and correlation factor are simultaneously \n\nprovided. \n\nThe calibrations for each gas were carried out three times in order to obtain \n\nreproducible and accurate results, which may be of special importance in the case of H2-\n\ncontaining mixtures, given the similarity of H2 and He thermal conductivities, since He \n\nwas used as carrier gas for the TCD.   \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure V.5 \u2013 Chromatogram for a binary 50:50% CO2/N2 mixture.  \n\n\n\nExperimental Section \n\n 84 \n\n \n\nFigure V.6 \u2013 Results for the CO2 calibration. \n\n \n\n2. Membranes \n\nIn this work, nineteen microporous membranes were studied: nine of AM-3, and five of \n\nETS-10. In addition, four ZSM-5 zeolite membranes and a last one of 4A- zeolite were \n\nalso evaluated for comparison. All membranes were synthesized in the Associated \n\nLaboratory CICECO (Department of Chemistry, University of Aveiro) by secondary \n\ngrowth procedure on commercial tubular ?-alumina (Inocermic) and stainless-steel (Mott \n\nCorporation) supports with different pore diameters. The ?-alumina supports were \n\nsymmetric with internal and external diameters of approximately 7 and 10 mm, \n\nrespectively, and were 8 cm long; porous stainless-steel supports had 8 and 10 mm of \n\ninternal and external diameters, respectively, and were 3.5 \u2013 4 cm long. In order to prevent \n\nby-pass of feed and permeate streams during the permeation measurements, alumina \n\nsupports were subjected to enamelling at both ends, being their permeation length reduced \n\nto approximately 5.5 cm; 2 cm long non-porous stainless-steel tubes were soldered at the \n\nend of the stainless-steel porous supports for the same purpose.  \n\nMembranes were synthesized with the crystalline layer on the outside of the tubular \n\nsupports. However, a quantity of crystals could be expected to be formed inside the tubes \n\n\n\nExperimental Section \n\n 85 \n\nas well, since supports were not wrapped during membranes synthesis. Several samples \n\nwere prepared varying the synthesis conditions (including time and number of synthesis).  \n\nThe structure and morphology of synthesized titanosilicate membranes have been \n\npreviously investigated at CICECO by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, \n\nenergy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, and X-ray mapping techniques. The main physical \n\nproperties of membranes studied are compiled in Table V.2.

In the first one, the driving force is created by generating a \n\ntotal pressure drop across the membrane, either by pressurizing the feed side or evacuating \n\nthe permeate side. In the second method, a sweep gas is used (typically He or Ar) to wash \n\nthe permeate chamber in order to decrease or vanish the partial pressure of the permeating \n\nspecies. In this case, the total pressure difference between the two sides of the membrane \n\ncould be zero, eliminating the presence of viscous flow, being the partial pressure \n\ndifference the driving force. Accordingly, the WK method imposes a composition gradient \n\nthrough the membrane by the flow of sweep gas in the permeate side. In addition, the \n\nturbulence created by the sweep gas helps desorption of adsorbed components. Both single \n\ngas permeation and mixture separation can be performed with this method. Nonetheless, \n\nsweep gas back-diffusion can occur and the new mixture, formed by permeate and sweep \n\nstreams, has to be further separated for industrial purposes. This method is thus more \n\nadvantageous for mixtures separation experiments, being that of the pressure difference the \n\npreferable method for single component permeation (Gump et al., 2000; Bernal, 2002).  \n\n \n\n3.1 Single gas permeation \n\nGases \n\nSingle gas permeation experiments were performed with a transmembrane pressure drop \n\nproviding the driving force, and no sweep gas was used. Nitrogen (Praxair, 99.995%), \n\nhelium (Praxair, 99.999%), carbon dioxide (Praxair, 99.95%), hydrogen (Praxair, \n\n99.995%), and oxygen (Praxair, 99.999%) were the molecules used for single gas \n\nmeasurements. \n\n \n\nMembrane pre-treatment \n\nThe presence of adsorbed compounds on the titanosilicate pores affects the permeation \n\nresults. ETS-10 and AM-3 crystals are hydrophilic, and therefore water molecules from \n\nmoisture are expected to be adsorbed on their structure. In order to remove the adsorbed \n\n\n\nExperimental Section \n\n 88 \n\nwater and eventually other compounds, a heating and cooling cycle had to be carried out \n\nup to ca. 200\u00baC. Single N2 permeance was measured at room temperature before and after \n\nthis thermal treatment to evaluate the effect of adsorbed compounds upon the gas \n\npermeation. The experimental procedure followed for this purpose is described under the \n\nnext item. During this heating treatment, a continuous He flow (20 cm3(PTN)/min) was \n\nkept through the membranes in order to facilitate the removal of the desorbed compounds.  \n\nMembranes were not submitted to higher temperatures due to thermal resistance \n\nlimitations of the o-rings used. In fact, at the beginning of the experiments, a membrane \n\nsealed with silicone o-rings was submitted to 300\u00baC; however, the o-rings melted and \n\ndamaged the membrane. Subsequently, a material with a higher thermal resistance, and \n\nholding at the same time sufficient flexibility, was attempted to be found; viton o-rings \n\nwere selected among a few number of options (service temperature around 200\u00baC).   \n\nThe heating and cooling cycle was repeated whenever a different gas was studied, \n\nand after changing membranes from the module (given their hydrophilic character). \n\n \n\nMeasurement of nitrogen permeance at room temperature \n\nDynamic characterization of new membranes should start by detecting the existence of \n\nrough defects or cracks by means of single gas permeation runs. Whenever detected, \n\nmembrane preparation conditions will be adjusted until defects elimination. In this work, \n\nsuch characterization was accomplished by measuring permeation fluxes of pure N2 at \n\nroom temperature. The arrangement of the experimental set-up used to carry out single gas \n\npermeation measurements, at fixed temperature and under different transmembrane \n\npressure drops, is schematically represented in Figure V.9. \n\nThe membrane was placed inside the stainless-steel module and sealed with viton o-\n\nrings. Sweep gas and retentate sides were kept blocked during the experiments (dead-end \n\nmode) to promote total permeation of the gas through the membrane. The stainless-steel \n\nmodule containing the membrane was placed inside the oven at fixed temperature. The \n\nflow rate of feed gas was fixed by a MFC and fed to the titanosilicate side of the \n\nmembrane. The permeate side was kept at atmospheric pressure while the transmembrane \n\n\n\nExperimental Section \n\n 89 \n\npressure drop was measured with the BPR after reaching equilibrium (stationary state). At \n\nthis moment the permeate flow rate, measured by the MFM, should equal the feed gas flow \n\nrate, what was always verified. \n\n \n\nFigure V.9 \u2013 Layout of experimental apparatus for preliminary N2 permeance tests. \n\n \n\nDuring these experiments the temperature was kept at 25 \u00baC and different feed flow \n\nrates were imposed. Permeance was then obtained by the slope of the permeation flux \n\nversus transmembrane pressure difference curve (see equation (II.3)).  \n\n \n\nPermeation of single gases at programmed temperature (PPT) \n\nA different test used to evaluate the membrane structure consists in the measurement of \n\npermeation fluxes of single gases at programmed temperature, with a fixed transmembrane \n\npressure drop. From permeation versus temperature curves it is possible to characterize the \n\ntransport mechanisms taking place at a given temperature and, subsequently, to detect \n\ndefects in the crystalline structure of the membrane. The PPT experiments were reported \n\nfor the first time by Bernal et al. (2002), being presented as a fast and reliable tool to \n\ninvestigate the characteristics of zeolite membranes. \n\n\n\nExperimental Section \n\n 90 \n\nFigure V.10 shows the experimental set-up used to carry out PPT measurements. \n\nGases with different molecular weights and diameters were studied, namely: N2, H2, He, \n\nCO2 and O2. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure V.10 - Layout of experimental apparatus for permeation at programmed \ntemperature of single gases. \n\n \n\nThe feed gas stream, regulated by a MFC, was fed to the membrane module placed \n\ninside the oven, and a temperature ramp was programmed with a fixed heating rate of 1 \n\n\u00baC/min. This value is generally sufficient to approach stationary state at each temperature, \n\nbut not excessively small to delay the experiments; moreover, it is the smaller heating rate \n\nallowed by the temperature controller. The permeate side was kept at atmospheric pressure, \n\nwhile transmembrane pressure difference was controlled by the BPR. During these \n\nexperiments the retentate side was no longer blocked. The values of the permeate flow \n\nmeasured by the MFM and temperature by the thermocouple were continually registered \n\n\n\nExperimental Section \n\n 91 \n\nalong time by the data acquisition system. Experiments were conducted with different feed \n\nflows in the temperature range of 25 to 180\u00baC, for fixed transmembrane pressure drops \n\nbetween 20 and 500 kPa. Permeances were obtained by the ratio of permeation fluxes and \n\ntransmembrane pressure difference (see equation (II.3)). \n\n \n\nMeasurement of single gas permeances at fixed temperatures  \n\nAfter discriminating the transport mechanisms, membranes with the desired microporous \n\nstructure are distinguished. Some permeation fluxes of defect-free membranes of pure N2, \n\nH2, He, O2, and CO2 at fixed temperatures were measured for different transmembrane \n\npressure drops to determine their permeances and corresponding ideal selectivities. The \n\nexperimental procedure adopted was similar to that for measurement of pure N2 permeance \n\nat room temperature. However, the results obtained overlapped those from PPT \n\nexperiments, and thus have been canceled. \n\n \n\n3.2 Mixture separation \n\nEven though single gas permeation and ideal selectivities are fundamental to evaluate \n\nmembranes quality, its primary aim is the separation of mixtures. In this work, the \n\ncapability of membranes to perform real separations was examined. Some binary mixtures \n\nwere studied at different temperatures. The separation factors obtained were determined \n\nand compared with those of single gases.  \n\nIn order to quantify the separation of binary mixtures, an on-line gas chromatograph \n\n(GC) was included on the experimental set-up to analyze the streams composition. The \n\narrangement of the experimental apparatus used to perform binary mixture separations is \n\nschematically represented in Figure V.11.  \n\n \n\n\n\nExperimental Section \n\n 92 \n\n \n\nFigure V.11 \u2013 Layout of experimental apparatus for mixtures separation. \n\n \n\nSimilarly to single gas permeation experiments, the membrane was hold inside the \n\nmodule, with both ends sealed with viton o-rings, and placed inside the oven to keep the \n\noperation temperature at the desired value. The feed mixture was generated by mixing two \n\npure component streams whose individual flow rates were regulated by two MFC\u2019s. The \n\nretentate side was opened to carry out the separation. Both feed and permeate sides were \n\nkept at atmospheric pressure while a sweep gas was used to increase the driving force; the \n\npermeate partial pressure was manipulated by varying the sweep gas flow rate via the third \n\nMFC.  \n\nAfter matching the stationary state, feed, retentate and permeate streams were \n\nanalyzed by the GC. Two manual three-way valves placed on the permeate and retentate \n\nlines allow one to select the streams direction, i.e., toward the atmosphere or toward the \n\nGC. A two-position microvolume sample injection valve (VICI) permits the injection of a \n\nfixed gas volume to the GC columns. In the load position, the selected stream flows \n\ncontinually through the sample loop into the atmosphere, while the mobile phase (He) \n\nflows through to the column. In the injection position, the loop is in line with the column \n\nV1\n\nV10\n\nV6\n\nV5\n\nV4\n\nV11V7\n\nV9V8\n\nV3\n\nV2\n\nV12\n\nV14\n\nV16\n\nH2\n\nN2\n\nHe\n\nCO2\n\nO2\n\nCH4\n\nMFC 1\n\nMFC 2\n\nMFC 3\n\nMFM\n\nBPR\n\nElectrical Oven\n\nTC\n\nPT\n\nV15\n\nVent\n\nVent\n\nGC\n\nV13\n\n\n\nExperimental Section \n\n 93 \n\nand the mobile phase injects the content of the loop onto the first column (VP Hayesep D), \n\nwhere the CO2, whenever present, is retained. The CO2-free stream is subsequently fed to \n\nthe second column (VP Molesieve), where the remaining permanent gases are separated. \n\nAt this moment, a second two-position valve (VICI) is automatically actuated allowing \n\nCO2 to by-pass the second column. The separated components flow then to the TCD, \n\nwhere the mixture composition is determined. Each analysis was carried out three times.    \n\nThe permeance of each component and the corresponding separation factors were \n\ncalculated by equations (II.2) and (II.4), respectively. \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n 95 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nVI. Results and Discussion \n \n\nThis chapter presents all experimental and modelling results obtained in this work. \n\nConcerning modelling, new expressions for Maxwell-Stefan thermodynamic factors were \n\nderived for pure and multicomponent Nitta, Langmuir-Freundlich, and Toth isotherms. Up \n\ntill now, only relations for Langmuir and dual-site Langmuir have been published, what is \n\na strong limitation since many adsorption systems exhibit distinct behaviours. As it will be \n\nshown it is possible to predict the permeation of binary mixtures through zeolite \n\nmembranes, when equilibrium and diffusivities are known for pure gases.   \n\nWith respect to experimental results, the dynamic characterization of the \n\nmicroporous membranes is presented, namely: the permeation of single gases and binary \n\nmixtures in AM-3, ETS-10, ZSM-5, and zeolite 4A membranes, at fixed and programmed \n\ntemperature and for several transmembrane pressure drops. Modelling results based on the \n\ntransport mechanisms described in Chapter III under the framework of the Maxwell-Stefan \n\napproach are also presented. \n\n \n\n1.

The use of different adsorption \n\nisotherms gives rise to different thermodynamic correction factors (Krishna and \n\nWesselingh, 1997). When the MS equations are used to describe the permeation of gas \n\nmixtures through zeolite membranes, the multicomponent Langmuir isotherm is commonly \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n 96 \n\nadopted by researchers, as firstly presented by Krishna (1990,1993). More recently, \n\nthermodynamic correction factors for the dual-site Langmuir model have been also \n\nconsidered (Krishna and Baur, 2003). However, it is clear from the literature that these two \n\nisotherms are not always the most appropriate to describe adsorption in zeolites. Therefore, \n\nin this work, new expressions for the thermodynamic factors have been developed and \n\ntested, specifically for the pure and multicomponent isotherms of Nitta, Langmuir-\n\nFreundlich, and Toth, since they are frequently applicable to represent equilibrium in \n\nzeolites as well as in the design of several engineering applications. The results obtained \n\nhave been compared with those provided by the Langmuir model. The new derived \n\nexpressions are listed in Table VI.1 - equations (VI.1) to VI.7) \u2013 whereas the Langmuir \n\nequations are given in Chapter III - equations (III.18) and (III.45).       \n\n \n\nTable VI.1 \u2013 Thermodynamic factors derived in this work for single-component and \nbinary mixtures for different isotherms.   \n\nLangmuir-Freundlich \n\nSingle-component \n\n?\nn\n?\n\n=?\n1\n\nLF  \n\n \n(VI.1)\n\nBinary mixture \n\n( )( )1/1\n1\n\n211LF,\n\n2\n11 ?+\n\n?\n=?\n\n??n\n?\n\n             =?21  ( )( )1/1 212,LF\n2\n\n?+\n?\n\n??n\n?\n\n             \n\n=?22  ( )( )1/1\n1\n\n212,LF\n\n1\n\n?+\n?\n\n??n\n?\n\n           ( )( )1/1 211LF,\n1\n\n12 ?+\n?=?\n\n??n\n?\n\n \n\n \n(VI.2)\n\nNitta \n\nSingle-component \n\n( )\n?\n\nn?\n?\n\n??\n=?\n\n1\n11 N  \n\n    \n(VI.3)\n\nBinary mixture \n\n( )\n1\n\n11\n\n21\n\n21,N1\n11 ?+\n\n?+?\n=?\n\n??\n?n?\n\n                 \n121\n\n1,N1\n12 ?+\n\n?=?\n??\nn?\n\n           \n\n \n(VI.4)  \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n 97 \n\n( )\n1\n\n11\n\n21\n\n12N,2\n22 ?+\n\n?+?\n=?\n\n??\n?n?\n\n               121\n2N,2\n\n21 ?+\n?=?\n\n??\nn?\n\n \n\nToth \n\nSingle-component \n\n1t\nt\n\n?\n=?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n \n\n       \n(VI.5)\n\nBinary mixture \n\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )[ ]\n( ) ( )[ ]2111112\n\n2211\n2\n\n1122112\n11 11\n\n2112121\nttpbpbt\n\npbpbpbpbpbt\ntt\n\nttttt\n\n?+??\n?????\n\n=?\n \n\n \n\n( )\n( ) ( )\n\n( )\n( )\n\n( )\n\n( )\n\n( )\n( )\n\n( ) ( )\n( )\n\n( )\n( )\n\n( )\n( )\n\n( ) ( )\n( )\n\n( ) ( )\n( )\n\n( ) ( )\n( )\n\n( ) ( )\n( )\n\n( ) ( )\n( )\n\n( ) ( )\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n?????\n\n??????\n\n??????+?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n+?+?+??=?\n\n+?+?+?\n\n+?+?+?\n\n+?+?+?+?\n\n+?+?+?+\n?\n\n1112\n3\n\n22\n\n212\n\n1\n2\n\n112\n2\n\n22\n\n212\n\n1\n3\n\n11222\n\n212\n\n1112\n2\n\n22\n\n212\n\n1\n2\n\n11222\n\n212\n\n111222\n\n212\n\n21\n2\n\n11\n\n12\n\n2111\n\n12\n\n2211\n2\n2\n\n12\n2\n\n11\n2\n2\n\n12\n\n22\n2\n2\n\n12\n\n11\n2\n2\n\n12\n2\n2\n\n12\n\n2222\n2\n2\n\n2\n\n1112\n\n122\n\n2\n\n122\n\n2\n\n122\n\n2\n\n122\n\n2\n\n122\n\n2\n\n122\n\n2\n\n12\n\n2\n\n12\n\n2\n\n212\n\n2\n\n12\n\n2\n\n22\n\n2\n\n12\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n22\n\n2\n\n2\n\n22\n\n2 \n\ntpbtpbtpbtpbtpbtpb\n\ntpbtpbtpbtpbtpbtpb\n\nttpbttpbpbpbtpbt\n\npbtpbttbppbtpb\n\nttt\nt\n\nttt\nt\n\nttt\nt\n\nttt\nt\n\nttt\nt\n\nttt\nt\n\ntt\nt\n\ntt\nt\n\nttt\nt\n\ntt\nt\n\ntt\nt\n\ntt\nt\n\nt\nt\n\ntt\nt\n\n \n\n( )\n( ) ( )\n\n( )\n( )\n\n( )\n\n( )\n\n( )\n( )\n\n( ) ( )\n( )\n\n( )\n( )\n\n( )\n( )\n\n( ) ( )\n( )\n\n( ) ( )\n( )\n\n( ) ( )\n( )\n\n( ) ( )\n( )\n\n( ) ( )\n( )\n\n( ) ( )\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n?????\n\n??????\n\n??????+?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n+?+?+??=?\n\n+?+?+?\n\n+?+?+?\n\n+?+?+?+?\n\n+?+?+?+\n?\n\n1112\n3\n\n22\n\n212\n\n1\n2\n\n112\n2\n\n22\n\n212\n\n1\n3\n\n11222\n\n212\n\n1112\n2\n\n22\n\n212\n\n1\n2\n\n11222\n\n212\n\n111222\n\n212\n\n21\n2\n\n11\n\n12\n\n2111\n\n12\n\n2211\n2\n2\n\n12\n2\n\n11\n2\n2\n\n12\n\n22\n2\n2\n\n12\n\n11\n2\n2\n\n12\n2\n2\n\n12\n\n111112\n\n2\n\n2221\n\n122\n\n2\n\n122\n\n2\n\n122\n\n2\n\n122\n\n2\n\n122\n\n2\n\n122\n\n2\n\n12\n\n2\n\n12\n\n2\n\n212\n\n2\n\n12\n\n2\n\n22\n\n2\n\n12\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n12\n\n2\n\n2\n\n22\n\n2 \n\ntpbtpbtpbtpbtpbtpb\n\ntpbtpbtpbtpbtpbtpb\n\nttpbttpbpbpbtpbt\n\npbtpbttbptpbtpb\n\nttt\nt\n\nttt\nt\n\nttt\nt\n\nttt\nt\n\nttt\nt\n\nttt\nt\n\ntt\nt\n\ntt\nt\n\nttt\nt\n\ntt\nt\n\ntt\nt\n\ntt\nt\n\nt\nt\n\ntt\nt\n\n \n\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )[ ( ) ( )\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ] ( ) ( )( )[ ]2111112221112111111\n\n2\n22222211\n\n2\n112222112222\n\n112111\n\n221121 222\n\nttpbpbtpbtpbpbttpb\n\npbttpbpbpbttpbpbtt\ntttttt\n\ntttttt\n\n?+??++\n\n+??????=?\n \n\n( ) ( ) 21 22111\ntt pbpb ++=?    \n\n      \n\n \n(VI.6) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n(VI.7)\n\n \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n 98 \n\nThe calculation of the thermodynamic correction factors require differentiation of the \n\nisotherms explicitly written in terms of fugacity or partial pressure (equation (III.43)). \n\nWhile Nitta multicomponent isotherm (equation (III.52)) is given directly in terms of \n\npartial pressure, and the multicomponent Langmuir and Langmuir-Freundlich isotherms \n\n(equations (III.44) and (III.58)) are easily inverted, the multicomponent Toth isotherm \n\n(equations (III.61) - (III.63)) is not so straightforward because of the complexity \n\nintroduced by exponent t .

It is worth noting that our optimization involved simultaneously the \nexperimental data for the three temperatures available, by taking into account the relations \n\nof Chapter III for the temperature dependence of the intrinsic parameters, i.e. equations \n\n(III.17), (III.50), (III.55), (III.56), (III.57) and (III.60). The reference temperature was set \n\n=oT 303 K. This approach was adopted in order to reduce the number of parameters and to \n\nallow the estimation of equilibrium at different temperatures. In the particular case of the \n\nLangmuir and Nitta models, the saturation loadings are usually set constant (e.g., Do \n\n(1998)), although some authors consider their variation too (e.g., van de Graaf et al., \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n 101 \n\n(1999)). In this work, the satq  temperature dependence was assumed to be similar to those \n\nof the Langmuir-Freundlich and Toth equations ((III.57); the parameter Nn  of the Nitta \n\nisotherm was the unique considered ?T independent; for the multicomponent Toth \n\nexpression, an approach similar to that of Lamia et al. (2009) was adopted while taking \n\nethaneT tt = .  \n\nIt is clear from the small AARDs obtained (1.67 \u2013 2.98%) that all equations are able \n\nto represent equilibrium data with similar and high accuracies within the ranges of \n\ntemperature and pressure studied. For the reference temperature, Langmuir-Freundlich and \n\nToth isotherms are found to practically reduce to the Langmuir model, especially for \n\nethane, as the corresponding heterogeneity parameters are nearly unity (see equations \n\n(III.54)and (III.59)). Similar results were obtained by Abdul-Rehman et al. (1990) and \n\nBuss and Heuchel (1997), which were attributed to the high surface homogeneity as well \n\nas the channel-like pore geometry of silicalite-1, where interactions between adsorbate \n\nmolecules can only occur to a small extent.  \n\nThe fitted Q  for each adsorption isotherm are analogous, namely 10.797\u201314.697 \n\nkJ/mol for methane and 26.552\u201328.323 kJ/mol for ethane, although they do not have to be \n\nnecessarily identical, since for Langmuir LQ  is the isosteric heat of adsorption, while for \n\nthe other isotherms it is only a measure of the adsorption heat.  \n\nConcerning the multicomponent equilibrium for the methane/ethane/silicalite-1 \n\nsystem, it has been estimated in this work from the pure gas isotherms. Accordingly, the \n\nparameters from Table VI.4 have been directly substituted in equations (III.44), (III.52), \n\n(III.58), and (III.63) to get Langmuir, Nitta, Langmuir-Freundlich, and Toth models, \n\nrespectively. In Figure VI.1 the equilibrium predictions at 303 K are shown. In the \n\ncalculations the saturation capacity of each component in the binary mixture was fixed \n\nequal to that of ethane for thermodynamic consistency, following the van de Graaf et al.\u2019s \n\napproach (van de Graaf et al., 1999).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n 102 \n\nTable VI.4 \u2013 Single-component isotherm parameters. \n\n                                                                     Langmuir                                                (eq.

This is due to competition effects, i.e., \n\nsince ethane is preferentially adsorbed, the amount of available sites for methane \n\nadsorption is reduced and consequently its surface concentration decreases. In contrast, the \n\nsame behaviour was not observed for ethane (Figure VI.1b), once the presence of methane \n\nin the binary mixture does not significantly influence its adsorption equilibrium. It is also \n\nevident from Figure VI.1 that all predicted binary isotherms exhibit a similar trend. \n\nHowever, for methane some deviations result from the different equations. For instance, \n\nNitta predicts higher concentration values in the solid, while Langmuir provides the \n\nsmaller ones. For ethane adsorption, the extended Nitta equation predicts slightly higher \n\nloadings while the remaining three perform similarly. \n\n \n\n\n\nFigu\n101.3\nLang\nrespe\n\n \n\nDete\n\nmem\n\nmem\n\nure VI.1 \u2013 \n3 kPa for (a\ngmuir-Freun\nectively). \n\nermination \n\nmbrane.

Such fittings were carried out by solving simultaneously \n\nthe MS equations for the zeolite and support layers, in order to determine their \n\ncorresponding profiles of ?  and pressure. The isotherm equations were used to calculate \n\nthe compositions in the feed/zeolite and zeolite/support interfaces.  \n\nThe calculated results are graphed in Figure VI.2 as flux versus pressure, for both \n\ntemperatures studied, and the regressed parameters are compiled in Table VI.6. Figure VI.2 \n\nshows an approximately linear dependence of methane permeation fluxes on pressure, \n\nwhile ethane fluxes tend to a maximum (monolayer capacity) at 303 K, due to its stronger \n\nadsorption strength on the zeolite. All isotherms analysed are able to anticipate this \n\nsaturation limit for sufficiently high pressures. Accordingly, a good fit was found for \n\nethane using all of them. On the other hand, only Langmuir and Toth predict the expected \n\nHenry\u2019s law limit at low pressures. Nonetheless, all isotherms describe accurately the \n\nmethane linear trend, since Nitta and Langmuir-Freundlich almost reduce to the Langmuir \n\nmodel (remember that LFn  and t  are nearly unity). It may be also observed that at higher \n\ntemperatures (Figure VI.2b, 373 K) the permeation of methane decreases, while that of \n\nethane increases. Such behaviour inclusively makes methane permeation inferior to ethane. \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n 105 \n\nBesides, ethane fluxes approach the linear limit, in comparison to 303 K, since its \n\nadsorption strength decreases with temperature. As previously discussed in Chapter III, the \n\npermeation flux of adsorbable molecules may show a typical maximum with temperature, \n\ndue to the opposing effects that temperature imparts upon diffusivity and adsorption. \n\nMoreover, a temperature shift of the maximum may be observed for molecules with \n\nincreasing adsorption strength, as evidenced for instance by results of Bernal et al. (2002) \n\nfor methane, ethane, propane and n-butane in a ZSM-5 membrane. Hence, the decrease of \n\nmethane flux with temperature may reflect the predominance of the decline of the amount \n\nof adsorbed molecules, whereas for ethane the enhancement on diffusivity still prevails in \n\nthis temperature range. \n\n \n\nTable VI.6 \u2013 Single-component diffusion parameters fitted to the experimental data of van \nde Graaf et al.

Taking \n\ninto account the estimated binary isotherms and the pure gas diffusivities determined above \n\nat 303 and 373 K, the membrane separation of a methane/ethane mixture has been totally \n\npredicted at 273, 303, 338, and 373 K, in order to validate the new expressions provided in \n\nthis work. Our results were compared with the experimental data published by van de \n\nGraaf et al. (1999) for the silicalite-1 membrane of Table VI.5.  \n\nvan de Graaf et al. (1999) performed experiments with different feed compositions \n\naccording to the Wicke-Kallenbach technique, i.e. using a constant flow rate of sweep gas \n\n(helium) to wash the permeate side. The retentate and permeate sides were well mixed. The \n\ncounterflux of the sweep gas was considered to be very low at the relatively low \n\ntemperatures of the experiments (273-373 K), and therefore neglected in their calculations. \n\nThe authors pointed out that if there was any effect of the sweep gas, it would be lumped in \n\nthe value of the diffusivity calculated from single-component experiments.  \n\nIn this work, the prediction of the permeation fluxes was performed without fitting \n\nany crossed parameters, by just using the estimated multicomponent isotherms and the \n\nVignes relation (equation (III.42)) for the calculation of the MS surface pair diffusivities \n\n( )sij\u00d0  from the single ones on the solid ( )si\u00d0 . The resistance of the support layer was \nincluded, and the isotherms were once more utilized to calculate the compositions in the \n\nfeed/zeolite and zeolite/support interfaces. The numerical solution was accomplished by \n\nsolving simultaneously the generalized MS equations for the zeolite and support layers to \n\nobtain their concentration profiles. The resulting ordinary differential equations were \n\nintegrated using the ode15s function of Matlab. \n\nThe calculated results are plotted in Figures VI.3 and VI.4 along with experimental \n\ndata. Both figures clearly point out the sound predictive capability of the Maxwell-Stefan \n\nmodel combined with the thermodynamic factors derived in this work, since no additional \n\nparameter was introduced. \n\nIn Figure VI.3, the fluxes of methane and ethane are plotted against ethane partial \n\npressure at 303 K, and emphasizes that all adsorption models give rise to results in good \n\nagreement with each other as well as with data points. In this figure, the ethane flux \n\nincreases by increasing its partial pressure, while methane performs inversely. \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n 107 \n\nAdditionally, it should be noted that fluxes predicted adopting Nitta isotherm are slightly \n\nhigher, while Langmuir equations underestimate them, being such differentiation more \n\nevident for methane. This behaviour could be anticipated from the binary isotherms shown \n\nin Figure VI.1, where Nitta equation presents the highest values. Nonetheless, equilibrium \n\nis still slightly better described by the extended Langmuir and Toth isotherms, although \n\nLangmuir-Freundlich and Nitta models also perform quite well. These conclusions are in \n\ngood agreement with those published by Abdul-Rehman et al. (1990), where the Toth \n\nmodel was found to give the best results for the first four alkanes (C1 \u2013 C4) adsorption in \n\nsilicalite-1, for both single component and binary mixtures, being the extended Langmuir \n\nequation also adequate for ethane, methane, and ethane/methane adsorption. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VI.3 \u2013 Permeation fluxes of a methane/ethane mixture as function of ethane partial \npressure: modelling (this work) and experimental data (van de Graaf et al., 1999).

These results point out that the binary permeation \n\nbehaviour may be not solely anticipated by single-component results. In fact, in the case of \n\ntwo adsorbable gases, the most adsorbed one may permeate preferentially through the \n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nx 10\n4\n\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n\n0.06\n\np ethane (Pa)\n\nF\nlu\n\nx \n(m\n\nol\n/m\n\n2 s\n)\n\nmethane \n\nethane \n\n303 K \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n 108 \n\nzeolitic pores, hindering the diffusion of the second molecule. Accordingly, the methane \n\nflux in the binary mixture is smaller. Moreover, as temperature rises, the permeation of \n\nethane decreases after 338 K, since its concentration in silicalite-1 diminishes and leaves \n\nmore vacant sites available for methane.

Dynamic characterization of microporous membranes  \n\n \n\n2.1 Single gas permeation \n\nDuring this work nineteen microporous membranes were synthesized by CICECO research \n\nteam, namely nine of titanosilicate AM-3, five of titanosilicate ETS-10, four of zeolite \n\nZSM-5, and a last one of zeolite 4A. All of these membranes were firstly characterized by \n\nmeasuring N2 permeance at room temperature, in order to investigate the existence of \n\nrough defects in their crystalline structure. Generally, permeances of small gases through \n\nmicroporous membranes higher than 610?  mol/m2s.Pa point out rough deficiencies. If \n\ngases with kinetic diameters larger than crystal pore size do permeate, the same conclusion \n\nmay be drawn. The average pore diameter of AM-3, ETS-10, ZSM-5, and zeolite 4A are \n\n0.3, 0.49\u00d70.76, 0.55, and 0.4 nm, respectively, and the kinetic diameter of N2 is 0.346 nm. \n\nConsequently, N2 permeation flux abnormally high reveal considerable defect density on \n\nthe membrane structure. Even though the pore dimensions of the several materials studied \n\nare different, only membranes with N2 permeance inferior to 610?  mol/m2s.Pa were \n\nconsidered for further detailed characterization. Please note that the kinetic diameter of N2 \n\nis larger than AM-3 pore diameter, and accordingly no permeance should be detected at all. \n\nHowever, a perfect microporous membrane is difficult to achieve and macro, meso or even \n\nmicrodefects may be always present in real systems. In addition, it is important to note that \n\npermeance depends on the membrane thickness (please see equation (II.1)), so comparison \n\nbetween different membranes should be made with caution. \n\nTable VI.7 lists N2 permeances at room temperature for all membranes studied.  \n\nAccording to the above mentioned primary criteria for membranes quality, AM-3-1 \n\nmembrane was excluded from the detailed characterization, since its N2 permeance was \n\nconsiderably high. Concerning AM-3-3, AM-3-4, and AM-3-5 membranes, their results are \n\nwithin the typical permeance range ( 710101 ?\u00d7?  mol/m2s.Pa), suggesting good quality \n\nmembranes, i.e. without a significant amount of large defects. Hence, these membranes \n\nwere subjected to subsequent detailed characterization, namely permeation at programmed \n\ntemperature (PPT) experiments using different gases and at several transmembrane \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n 110 \n\npressure drops. From temperature-permeation curves it is possible to identify the prevailing \n\ntransport mechanisms involved and subsequently detect defects. \n\nAM-3-7, AM-3-8, AM-3-9, AM-3-10, and AM-3-11 membranes were synthesized \n\nafter characterization of the first four AM-3 membranes. Their N2 permeances were \n\nmeasured after a first synthesis and values superior to those of previous three membranes \n\nwere found. Since membranes exhibiting smaller N2 permeances are desired, they were \n\nsubmitted to a second synthesis step. After this second crystallization, N2 permeances were \n\nfound to be not significantly reduced, being still larger for AM-3-8, AM-3-9, and AM-3-10 \n\nmembranes. This suggests that a second synthesis can result in a membrane of lower \n\nquality. Similar results were obtained by Lin et al. (2004) for ETS-10 membranes, which \n\nwere attributed to the partial dissolution of the first formed ETS-10 layer, hindering a good \n\nintergrowth between neighbour crystals. In an attempt to improve the quality of the three \n\nabove cited membranes a third synthesis step is presently in course. \n\nThe nitrogen permeances of the five ETS-10 membranes studied are slightly higher \n\nthan the reference values range ( 610?>  mol/m2s.Pa). Similarly to the last five AM-3 \n\nmembranes, ETS-10-4 and ETS-10-5 membranes were subjected to additional \n\ntitanosilicate layers deposition. Concerning ETS-10-4 membrane, after the second \n\nsynthesis its N2 permeance decreased below the detection limit of the experimental set-up, \n\nand accordingly no additional measurements were possible. On the other hand, the \n\npermeance of ETS-10-5 membrane was only slightly decreased, and therefore a third \n\nsynthesis was carried out. After this last crystallization step, N2 permeance was found be to \n\nsignificantly reduced. Hence, ETS-10-5 membrane was also considered for further \n\ncharacterization. \n\nWith respect to the ZSM-5 membranes, only the first one presents an acceptable N2 \n\npermeance, i.e. below 610?  mol/m2s.Pa. In fact, the permeance of ZSM-5-1 membrane was \n\nconsiderably small (5.21\u00d710-8 mol/m2s.Pa) indicating probably a noticeable low defects \n\ndensity. Despite the well-established characterization of ZSM-5 membranes, this \n\nmembrane was subjected to further permeation tests because of its interesting organophilic \n\ncharacter, distinct of that of AM-3, ETS-10 and zeolite 4A. Hence, single N2 and CO2 \n\npermeance measurements at two fixed temperatures were carried out.  \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n 111 \n\nA similar procedure was adopted for testing the zeolite 4A membrane quality, \n\nresulting in a N2 permeance of 4.30\u00d710-8 mol/m2s.Pa after three crystallization steps. This \n\nmembrane was thus subsequently submitted to experiments at programmed temperature, in \n\norder to detect the transport mechanism involved in gas transport. However, results are not \n\npresented since the support started to oxidize.   \n\n \n\nTable VI.7 \u2013 Nitrogen permeances for the various membranes studied in this work, \ntogether with permeances of supports used, at room temperature. \n\nMembrane/support \nNo. separation \n\nlayers \n?

Generally, non-adsorbable gases or gases with \n\nlinear adsorption isotherms (Henry regime) show a linear relation between permeation flux \n\nand pressure gradient across the membrane and so pressure-independent permeances. In \n\ncontrast, Figure VI.6a evidences a nonlinear dependence of N2 flux on pressure, which \n\nmay be attributed to the contribution of viscous flow mechanism to the total permeation. \n\nSuch contribution is also evidenced by the pressure-dependence of permeance (Figure \n\nVI.6b), as well as by permeance decline with increasing temperature (see equation (III.2)).  \n\nThe main objective of the membranes studied in this work concerns the separation of \n\nsmall gases. Since ETS-10-3 membrane presents a considerably amount of macro-defects, \n\nwhere non-selective viscous mechanism dominates, this membrane would not be suitable \n\nfor this purpose. Hence, no additional tests were performed with this membrane.    \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n 114 \n\nFigure VI.6  \u2013 a) N2 permeation fluxes and b) corresponding permeances of ETS-10-3 \nmembrane at 24 and 55\u00baC. \n\n \n\nETS-10-5 membrane \n\nThe N2 permeance of ETS-10-5 membrane after the first synthesis step (Table VI.7) was \n\nsignificantly higher than the typical permeance range for micropores ( 66 101010.7 ?? >\u00d7  \n\nmol/m2sPa). A permeation at programmed temperature experiment was subsequently \n\ncarried out in order to verify the existence of macro- and/or mesopores. The obtained \n\nresults, presented in Figure VI.7a, evidence the expected decrease of the permeance with \n\ntemperature, confirming the existence of such defects.  \n\nA second crystallization was carried out in order to improve membrane quality. After \n\nthis synthesis, the N2 permeance has decreased ca. three times, which indicates that some \n\nlarge defects were probably fixed. However, the decrease in permeance was not as \n\npronounced as required, and thus a significant amount of defects still existed in the \n\nmembrane, as supported by the PPT results pictured in Figure VI.7a. Nonetheless, it should \n\nbe emphasized that the permeance decline after the second synthesis is considerably \n\nsmoother for the same transmembrane pressure drop (0.5 bar). \n\nAfter a third titanosilicate layer synthesis, a meaningful decrease in permeance was \n\nfinally found, i.e., it dropped two orders of magnitude. Accordingly, most of the larger \n\ndefects presented initially in the ETS-10-4 membrane were possibly eliminated after three \n\nsynthesis.

In the lower temperature range, the permeance decreases owing \n\nto the Knudsen contribution, and eventually to some residual viscous flow through the \n\npersisting defects of the titanosilicate layer, while it increases monotonously at higher \n\ntemperatures due to activated diffusion through micropores. This result indicates that the \n\nquality of the membrane was significantly improved. It should be noted that the last PPT \n\nrun was carried out with a transmembrane pressure drop as high as 5 bar, since for lower \n\ndriving forces the permeation fluxes were not measurable (values below the detection limit \n\nof the equipment).  \n\nSimilar results were obtained by Xu et al. (2005), who employed a multi-stage \n\nsynthesis method for preparation of NaA membranes and found the best quality membrane \n\nafter a three-stage synthesis. Tiscornia et al.

Figure VI.8 shows the PPT results for these gases, measured under the same \n\ntransmembrane pressure drop of 1 bar. As may be observed, CO2 and N2 show similar \n\npermeances of 0.2 \u2013 0.4\u00d710-7 mol/(m2sPa), which are significantly lower than those of He \n\nand H2 (0.7 \u2013 1.2\u00d710-7 mol/(m2sPa)). It should be noted that the permeation of bulkier N2 \n\nand CO2 molecules may be only attributed to the transport through defects larger than the \n\ntitanosilicate pores, since the kinetic diameters of these gases (0.364 and 0.33 nm, \n\nrespectively) are larger than the AM-3 pore size (0.3 nm). In addition, since H2 and He are \n\nsmaller than the pore diameter, one could expect the permeance of these molecules to be \n\ngoverned by activated diffusion and display a clear increase with temperature. However, \n\nboth H2 and He are small molecules capable of high permeation rates through inter-\n\ncrystalline defects. Thus, in membranes with significant defect density the effect of \n\npermeation through defects could overcome activated contribution in the micropores. \n\nTherefore, the descending pattern of this membrane may be considered a reliable indicator \n\nof the presence of defects. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VI.8  \u2013 Permeances of He, H2, N2 and CO2 measured at programmed \ntemperature in the AM-3-3 membrane for P?  = 1 bar. \n\n20 40 60 80 100 120 140\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\nx 10\n\n-7\n\nP\ner\n\nm\nea\n\nnc\ne \n\n(m\nol\n\n/(\nm\n\n2 s\nP\n\na)\n)\n\nT (\u00baC)\n\nH2\n\nHe\n\nN2\nCO2\n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n 117 \n\nFigure VI.9 compares the permeance of He, H2, N2 and CO2 obtained for two distinct \n\ntransmembrane pressure drops: 1 and 2 bar. It is clear that P?  has only a mild effect on \n\nthe permeance, especially for He and H2. However, an increase of the permeance with \n\npressure was found for all the gases, corroborating the contribution of viscous flow to the \n\ntotal permeation. It is important to note that He and H2 diffusion is less dependent on the \n\npressure, since their transport may occur through micropores and defects also, while N2 \n\nand CO2 diffuse uniquely through defects given their kinetic diameters larger than AM-3 \n\npore size. Accordingly, the contribution from viscous flow is expected to be more \n\nimportant for N2 and CO2.   \n\nFigure VI.9a presents two overlapped permeation curves for He at ?P = 2 bar, being \n\nthe first one measured only until 120\u00baC, while the second one was carried out up to 170\u00baC, \n\nand after all the other PPT runs with the remaining gases. The results for the second PPT \n\nexperiment were consistent with those previously obtained and reveal the predominance of \n\ngas transport through macro and/or meso-defects even for higher temperatures. In addition, \n\nthe membrane is found to be stable during repeated heating and cooling cycles in this \n\ntemperature range.   \n\nThe relationship between the permeance of the AM-3-3 membrane and the kinetic \n\ndiameters and molecular weight of the permeating gases is presented in Figure VI.10. This \n\nfigure emphasizes a clear permeance dependence on both properties. Moreover, as \n\npreviously discussed, a pronounced permeance decline may be observed for gases with \n\nkinetic diameter superior to the AM-3 pore size, reporting at least some molecular sieving \n\neffect (see Figure VI.10a). Observed results also showed a clear trend of decreasing \n\npermeance with increasing molecular weight, following the typical behaviour of Knudsen \n\ndiffusion (see Figure VI.10 b and equation (III.6)).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n 118 \n\nFigure VI.9 \u2013 Permeances measured at programmed temperature in the AM-3-3 \nmembrane under P?  = 1 and 2 bar for a) He, b) H2, c) N2 and d) CO2. \n\n \n\nThe dominance of the Knudsen mechanism can be further verified in Figure VI.11, \n\nwhere the permeance of the four studied gases shows a linear trend with the inverse of the \n\nsquare root of the molecular weight (see Figure VI.11a), as expected for this transport \n\nmechanism (see equation (III.6)). Concerning the viscous flow mechanism, its dependence \n\non gas viscosity implies a dependence on both kinetic diameter and molecular weight. \n\nFollowing, for instance, the method of Chung et al. (1984) for estimating gas viscosity, \n\nbased on the theory of Chapman and Enskog, such dependence may be described by \n2\nk\n\n5.0 dM? ? . It is clear from Figure VI.11b that the permeances roughly follow the inverse \n\nof the square root of molecular weight multiplied by the corresponding square of kinetic \n\ndiameter, indicating as well some contribution from viscous flow. \n\n20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nx 10\n-8\n\nP\ner\n\nm\nea\n\nnc\ne \n\n(m\nol\n\n/(\nm\n\n2 s\nP\n\na)\n)\n\nT (\u00baC)\n20 40 60 80 100 120 140\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\nx 10\n\n-8\n\nP\ner\n\nm\nea\n\nnc\ne \n\n(m\nol\n\n/(\nm\n\n2 s\nP\n\na)\n)\n\nT (\u00baC)\n\n20 40 60 80 100 120 140\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\nx 10\n\n-8\n\nP\ner\n\nm\nea\n\nnc\ne \n\n(m\nol\n\n/(\nm\n\n2 s\nP\n\na)\n)\n\nT (\u00baC)\n20 40 60 80 100 120 140\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\nx 10\n\n-8\n\nP\ner\n\nm\nea\n\nnc\ne \n\n(m\nol\n\n/(\nm\n\n2 s\nP\n\na)\n)\n\nT (\u00baC)\n\nHe H2\n\nN2 CO2\n\n?P = 2bar \n\n?P = 1bar \n?P = 1bar \n\n?P = 2bar \n\n?P = 2bar\n\n?P = 1bar \n\n?P = 2bar \n\n?P = 1bar \n\na) b) \n\nc) d) \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n 119 \n\nAccording to the previous results, it may be concluded that gas transport through the \n\nAM-3-3 membrane is clearly dominated by both Knudsen and viscous flow mechanisms.  \n\n \n\nFigure VI.10 \u2013 Dependence of He, H2, N2 and CO2 permeances in the AM-3-3 \nmembrane on a) gas molecular diameters (Breck, 1974) and b) molecular weights, for \n40\u00baC and P?  = 1 bar. \n\n \n\nFigure VI.11 \u2013 Permeance of He, H2, N2, and CO2 in the AM-3-3 membrane as function \nof a) the inverse of the square root of their molecular weight and b) the ratio between \nthe square of kinetic diameters and the square root of their molecular weight, for the \nsame operating conditions as in Figure VI.10 (40 \u00baC and P?  = 1 bar). \n\n \n\n0.24 0.26 0.28 0.3 0.32 0.34 0.36 0.38\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nx 10\n-7\n\ndk (nm)\n\nP\ner\n\nm\nea\n\nnc\ne \n\n(m\nol\n\n/(\nm\n\n2 s\nP\n\na)\n)\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nx 10\n-7\n\nM (g/mol)\n\nP\ner\n\nm\nea\n\nnc\ne \n\n(m\nol\n\n/(\nm\n\n2 s\nP\n\na)\n)\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\nx 10\n\n-8\n\nM-0.5 (g/mol)-0.5\n\nP\ner\n\nm\nea\n\nnc\ne \n\n(m\nol\n\n/(\nm\n\n2 s\nP\n\na)\n)\n\n0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025 0.03 0.035 0.04 0.045 0.05 0.055 0.06\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\nx 10\n\n-8\n\ndk\n2/M0.5 nm2(g/mol)-0.5\n\nP\ner\n\nm\nea\n\nnc\ne \n\n(m\nol\n\n/(\nm\n\n2 s\nP\n\na)\n)\n\nHe \n\nH2 \n\nCO2 \nN2\n\nHe\n\nH2\n\nN2 \nCO2\n\nCO2 \nN2 \n\nHe \n\nH2 H2 \n\nHe\n\nN2\nCO2\n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n 120 \n\nFigure VI.12 shows the ideal selectivities of H2/CO2, H2/N2, He/CO2 and He/N2, \n\nHe/H2 and N2/CO2 calculated based on the permeance data for 40, 70, 100, and 120\u00baC.

Transport through macro- and \n\nmeso-defects was described by both Knudsen and viscous flow, while micropore diffusion \n\nwas assumed to occur by activated gaseous mechanism. Previous studies (Lin et al., 1997) \n\nhave revealed that N2 is practically non-adsorbed on AM-3. Since permeation results do \n\nnot evidence the contribution of surface diffusion (i.e. the presence of a minimum followed \n\nby a maximum in the T? ?  curve), for the remaining gases it was not taken into account. \n\nEquation (III.26) was adopted to fit the experimental data of Figure VI.8, by taking \n\n0=s?  as aforementioned. A geometric factor, supg , was included in order to take the \n\nsupport effect into account. The membrane geometrical parameters for Knudsen and \n\nviscous flow mechanisms were considered equal for all gases, since they only depend on \n\nmembrane features. In contrast, for activated diffusion one distinct constant accounting for \n\ngeometrical parameters was fixed for molecules capable to permeate AM-3 pores (H2 and \n\nHe) and another one for molecules larger than AM-3 pore diameter (N2 and CO2). This \n\ndistinction is due to the fact that H2 and He, and N2 and CO2 diffuse through different \n\nmicroporous pathways, i.e., AM-3 structural pores and larger intercrystalline micropores.             \n\nFigure VI.13 shows model results together with experimental data. The calculated \n\nparameters are compiled in Table VI.10. The figure points out the reliable agreement \n\nbetween modelling and experimental data, corresponding to %9.5=AARD , being the \n\nhigher deviations found for the lower temperature range. The different contributions of \n\neach individual transport mechanism for H2 permeation are illustrated in Figure VI.14. As \n\nmay be observed, H2 permeance takes place mainly by Knudsen diffusion, with a minor \n\ncontribution from viscous flow. Besides, as expected from the decreasing trend of \n\npermeance against temperature, the activated gaseous diffusion is not significant. These \n\nresults are in total agreement with the previous discussion.  \n\nThe optimized parameter of the activated diffusion of molecules larger than AM-3 \n\npore size, i.e. N2 and CO2, is one order of magnitude inferior to that of H2 and He \n\n(1.719\u00d710-11 versus 2.148\u00d710-10), due to the relative sizes of the molecules and the \n\npermeated pores. With respect to the activation energies, the small values found for N2 and \n\nCO2 (1.7 and 4.0 kJ/mol, respectively) in relation to those of H2 and He (13.3 and 11.0 \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n 122 \n\nkJ/mol, respectively) rely upon the average pore diameters where diffusion occurs, namely \n\nthe inter and intracrystalline micropores of the AM-3 membrane.

Once more, permeation at programmed \n\ntemperature experiments, under two distinct transmembrane pressure drops (1 and 2 bar), \n\nwere performed in order to identify the prevailing transport mechanisms.  \n\nPPT results, shown in Figure VI.16, are in good agreement with those obtained for \n\nfixed temperatures, i.e., the N2 permeance decreases over all the temperature range studied, \n\nbeing enhanced with the transmembrane pressure difference. Such results denunciate a \n\nsignificant amount of macro-defects on the AM-3-4 membrane structure. Accordingly, no \n\nadditional characterization tests were carried out on this membrane, since it is not suitable \n\nfor desired separations. \n\n \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n 124 \n\nFigure VI.15 \u2013 a) N2 permeation flux and b) corresponding permeances along with the \ntransmembrane pressure drop for the AM-3-4 membrane, at 25, 100 and 140\u00baC. \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure VI.16 \u2013 Effect of temperature and pressure on the N2 permeance of the AM-3-4 \nmembrane. \n\n \n\nAM-3-5 membrane \n\nThe permeance of several gases through AM-3-5 membrane was continuously measured \n\nalong with temperature.

In \n\ncontrast, due to their smaller dimensions, H2 molecules are able to easily diffuse through \n\nAM-3 pores as well as through larger defects and, accordingly, their permeance is \n\nconsiderably higher. \n\nFigure VI.17 shows an initial plateau in the H2 permeance, followed by a subsequent \n\nmonotonous increase with temperature. This behaviour is frequently found for diffusion of \n\nsmall permanent gases through real microporous membranes, and can be explained by the \n\nsimultaneous occurrence of distinct transport mechanisms. At lower temperatures, \n\nKnudsen and viscous flow through macro and/or meso-defects may prevail, whereas at \n\nhigher temperatures transport occurs via activated gaseous diffusion through micropores. \n\nAlthough a significant density of defects may be present, the permeance increase with \n\ntemperature indicates a preponderance of activated permeation through the microporous \n\ntitanosilicate layer and, therefore, a lower concentration of defects may be admitted. Such \n\nincreasing trend is expected to be more pronounced at higher temperatures.  \n\nConcerning N2, CO2 and O2 diffusion, their permeance was found to be less \n\ndependent on temperature. This may be due to an equilibration between the competitive \n\nmechanisms discussed above. Given this behaviour, at least some defects are expected to \n\nbe of a size roughly similar to those of N2, CO2 and O2 molecules. However, the activated \n\ndiffusion eventually present in such micro-defects may be not as significant as for H2 \n\ndiffusion, and thus not important enough to prevail in the temperature range studied. \n\nMoreover, based on permeation results for these gases on microporous zeolite-type \n\nmaterials, their activation energy for diffusion is expected to be larger than that of H2, and, \n\naccordingly, higher temperatures are required to allow them to overcome the pore structure \n\nrestrictions. In fact, this behaviour is frequently reported in the literature for permeation \n\nthrough microporous membranes. For instance, Aoki et al., (1998) reported N2 and CO2 \n\npermeances unchanged with temperature up to 100\u00baC through an A-type zeolite membrane. \n\nPoshusta et al., (1998) presented the permeation results of several gases through a SAPO-\n\n34 membrane and showed N2 and CO2 permeances considerably less temperature-\n\ndependence exhibiting a slight minimum. Bernal (2002) presented almost temperature-\n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n 126 \n\nindependent results for permeation of H2 through a ZSM-5 membrane, and permeation of \n\nN2 through MOR and ZSM-5 membranes.  \n\nFigure VI.18 shows the effect of the transmembrane pressure drop on H2 permeation. \n\nIt is clear from this figure that the H2 permeance is only slightly influenced by pressure, \n\nindicating the presence of some large defects. However, the extent of such defects cannot \n\nbe surely deduced from these results once the P?  values studied are not sufficiently \n\ndifferent. Nonetheless, experiments for higher fluxes, i.e. for conditions where permeances \n\nare much superior, could not be carried out due to set-up limitations.      \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure VI.17 \u2013 Permeance of H2, N2, CO2, and O2 at programmed temperature of AM-3-5 \nmembrane for P?  = 0.2 bar. \n\n \n\nThe dependence of permeances on kinetic diameter and molecular weight of \n\npermeating gases are pictured in Figure VI.19a and VI.19b. As may be observed, in \n\ngeneral no specific relationships were found between permeances and kinetic diameters or \n\nmolecular weights. However, the permeance of the smaller H2 molecules stills detaches \n\nfrom the remaining gases, indication some contribution from molecular sieving effect.

As expected, in this case permeances did not \n\nperfectly scale with the square root of their molar mass ratios. Besides, a linear dependence \n\non the ration between the square of kinetic diameter and the square root of molecular \n\nweight, as expected for the viscous mechanism, was not found as well. Based in these \n\nresults one may conclude that neither the Knudsen mechanism nor the viscous one may be \n\nassumed predominant.    \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure VI.18 \u2013 Permeance of H2 at programmed temperature of AM-3-5 membrane \nunder P?  = 0.2 and 0.5 bar. \n\n \n\n20 40 60 80 100 120 140\n\n1.4\n\n1.5\n\n1.6\n\n1.7\n\n1.8\n\n1.9\n\n2\n\n2.1\nx 10\n\n-6\n\nP\ner\n\nm\nea\n\nnc\ne \n\n(m\nol\n\n/(\nm\n\n2 s\nP\n\na)\n)\n\nT (\u00baC)\n\nH2 \n\n?P = 0.2bar \n\n?P = 0.5bar \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n 128 \n\nFigure VI.19 \u2013 Dependence of H2, N2, O2, and CO2 permeances in the AM-3-5 \nmembrane on a) gas kinetic diameters and b) molecular weights, for 40\u00baC and P?  = 0.2 \nbar. \n\n \n\nFigure VI.20 \u2013 Permeance of H2, N2, O2, and CO2 in the AM-3-5 membrane a) as \nfunction of the inverse of the square root of their molecular weight and b) in function of \nthe ratio between the square of kinetic diameter and the inverse of the square root of \ntheir molecular weight, for the same operating conditions as in Figure VI.19 (40 \u00baC and \n\nP?  = 0.2 bar). \n\n \n\nThe effect of the presence of water within AM-3 framework was evaluated by \n\ncarrying out PPT experiments after the membrane humidification.

This is a totally expectable result \n\ngiven the high hydrophilic character of AM-3 crystals. Besides, the activated tendency was \n\nimproved for both gases. This may be due to the blockage of some inter-crystalline defects, \n\nwhich could allow an earlier prevalence of activated diffusion for lower temperatures. In \n\naddition, the removal of water molecules by increasing temperature may be also \n\nresponsible for the remarkable increase of H2 and CO2 permeances for higher \n\ntemperatures.  \n\nThe beneficial effect of water in hydrophilic membrane separations has been \n\ninvestigated by Sebastian et al. (2008) for the separation of H2 from N2 in the presence of \n\nmoisture using a microporous titanosilicate AM-2 membrane. In their study, a H2O/H2/N2 \n\nmixture was fed to the membrane with a water relative pressure of 0.7, which is high \n\nenough to ensure capillary condensation of water in inter-crystalline defects. It was found \n\nthat unlike other zeolitic membranes, moisture did not seem to permeate through the \n\nintrinsic micropores of AM-2 but used the inter-crystalline defects existing in the \n\nmembrane where it was capillary condensed. This gave rise to a tremendous increase of the \n\nH2/N2 selectivity (from close to 50 to more than 800) in the presence of a sufficient high \n\npartial pressure of water. However, no significant effect was found when using a \n\nhydrophilic mordenite membrane, once its micropores are large enough to allow the \n\npassage of water.      \n\n \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n 130 \n\n  \n\nFigure VI.21 \u2013 Permeance of H2 and CO2 as function of temperature after AM-3-5 \nmembrane humidification (same operating conditions as those of PTP runs in Figure \nVI.17); results obtained before humidification are also presented for comparison.  \n\n \n\nThe dependence of ideal selectivities with temperature is illustrated in Figure VI.22. \n\nBy comparison with values of Table VI.9, it is found that ideal selectivities for CO2/O2 and \n\nN2/CO2 are slightly higher and ideal selectivities for H2/N2 and H2/CO2 are inferior to those \n\nof the Knudsen diffusion. These results corroborate the presence of some defects in the \n\nmembrane. However, given the higher selectivity values, they may be assumed to be \n\npresent in less extent than for the previously studied membranes. Concerning the \n\ntemperature effect, both N2/CO2, and CO2/O2 ideal selectivities decrease with temperature, \n\nsince CO2 permeance increases faster than that of N2, and O2 increases faster than that of \n\nCO2. The ideal selectivity of H2/CO2 and H2/N2 show a relatively pronounced increasing \n\ntrend with temperature, given the activated diffusion of H2 through smaller AM-3 \n\nmicropores. \n\nThe ideal selectivities for H2/CO2 before and after the membrane humidification are \n\ncompared in Figure VI.22b. This figure clearly points out an expected enhancement in the \n\nideal selectivity after humidification. However, such enhancement tends to vanish with \n\nincreasing temperature, because of the removal of water molecules responsible for the \n\nblockage of some inter-crystalline pores.  \n\n20 40 60 80 100 120 140\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\nx 10\n\nP\ner\n\nm\nea\n\nnc\ne \n\n(m\nol\n\n/(\nm\n\n2 s\nP\n\na)\n)\n\nT (\u00baC)\n\nH2 (dry membrane) \n\nH2 (wet membrane) \n\nCO2 (dry membrane) \n\nCO2 (wet membrane) \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n 131 \n\n \n\nFigure VI.22 \u2013 Ideal selectivities for several binary systems in the AM-3-5 membrane \nas function of temperature. \n\n \n\nIt is important to note that although the permeations at programmed temperature \n\nevidence the better quality of the AM-3-5 membrane in comparison with AM-3-3 \n\nmembrane, its permeances are around one order of magnitude superior, which could \n\ndenunciate a higher density of large defects. Such disagreement may be attributed to \n\ndifferences of the thickness and pore size distributions. In order to roughly elucidate this \n\nfeature, the ratios between the permeances of both membranes at 40\u00baC for H2, N2, and CO2 \n\nwere calculated. Assuming viscous or Knudsen flow, equations (III.2) and (III.6) show that \n\nthis ratio reduces to ( ) 2133AMp,53AMp,53AM33AM33AM53AM ????????????? \u00d7= dd???? , which for H2, \nN2, and CO2 gives 14, 27, and 21, respectively. These values are close inside the same \n\norder of magnitude and so the higher permeances in AM-3-5 membrane may be ascribed \n\nessentially to its thinner thickness. \n\nSimilarly to the AM-3-3 membrane, the permeation data of Figure VI.17 were \n\nmodelled based on the transport mechanisms discussed in Chapter III. Also for this \n\nmembrane, surface diffusion was not taken into account.

As for the previously discussed Figure \n\nVI.20, a predominance of a particular transport mechanism was not observed. In fact, \n\nFigure VI.24 evidences an identical contribution of Knudsen and viscous flow to the \n\ntransport through defects. Besides, the activated gaseous diffusion is considerable for the \n\ntotal transport, being more important at higher temperatures, as expected. \n\nTable VI.11 compiles the calculated model parameters. Also in this case, the \n\nactivated diffusion parameter of molecules larger than AM-3 pore size, i.e. N2, CO2, and \n\nO2, is one order of magnitude inferior to that of H2 (4.916\u00d710-6 versus 1.769\u00d710-5). \n\nBesides, they are significantly higher than those of the AM-3-3 membrane, corroborating \n\nthe sound contribution of activated diffusion for transport through this membrane. This \n\nresult is also consentaneous with the increasing trend of the T? ?  curves. Likewise AM-\n\n3-3 membrane, the activation energies found for the molecules larger than AM-3 pore size \n\n(3.0, 4.6, and 5.5 kJ/mol for N2, CO2, and O2, respectively) are smaller than that of H2 \n\n(10.0 kJ/mol), reflecting distinct diffusing pathways.

The permeance of N2 increases \nwith temperature, which supports the activated nature of gaseous diffusion in small \n\nmicropores. This result suggests that the transport is not controlled by Knudsen mechanism \n\nin mesopores, since in this case \n2N\n\n?  would decrease with increasing T .  \n\nIn contrast to N2, the flux of CO2 deviates from previous behavior due to adsorption \n\neffects. As seen in Figure VI.26, the flux deviates clearly from the linear trend expected at \n\nlow P? . Figure VI.27 corroborates this finding as the permeances of CO2 vary with P? , a \ntypical result for adsorbable gases. Such trend is more pronounced at lower temperatures, \n\nsince adsorption decreases with increasing temperature. Furthermore, as P?  is raised, \n\n2CO\n? becomes nearly constant because the surface concentration tends toward saturation \n\nand the surface diffusion stabilizes. It is important to conclude that in this range of \n\noperation the surface diffusion is more significant than the activated gaseous diffusion, \n\nwhile \n2CO\n\n?  decreases with increasing temperature.  \n\nThe calculated ideal selectivity, * /NCO 22? , was plotted against P?  at both \n\ntemperatures in Figure VI.27b. * /NCO 22?  decreases with transmembrane pressure drop \n\nbecause CO2 permeance decreases whereas that of N2 does not change significantly with \n\npressure. Concerning the temperature effect, ideal selectivity shows the expected trend, i.e. \n\nit decreases with increasing temperature, since the adsorption load is reduced. \n\n \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n 136 \n\n \n\nFigure VI.26 \u2013 Fluxes of pure N2 and CO2 in ZSM-5-1 membrane against transmembrane \npressure drop at 30\u00baC.

According to the previously discussed results for AM-3, ETS-10, 4A \n\nzeolite, and ZSM-5 membranes, a significant density of defects was found for most of \n\nthem, which may give rise to non-selective transport.

Accordingly, for such binary \n\nmixtures, high separation factors could be ideally predicted. However, due to the presence \n\nof macro and meso-defects, the desired sieving mechanism is weakened and selectivities \n\ndiminish.    \n\nPermeation of equimolar binary mixtures of H2/CO2, N2/CO2 and H2/N2 were \n\nmeasured at three temperatures, while feed and sweep gas (helium) flow rates were fixed. \n\nFigure VI.28 shows the separation factors for both AM-3-3 and AM-3-5 membranes. They \n\nare around 1 and 1.6 and do not change significantly with temperature, except for \n\nH2/CO2/AM-3-5. These results are in accordance with the conclusions drawn from the pure \n\ngas permeation, being attributed to non-selective transport through large defects, which do \n\nnot allow an efficient separation.  \n\nConcerning AM-3-3 membrane, the separation factors for N2/CO2 are quite similar to \n\nthe corresponding ideal selectivity values (see Figure VI.12), while for H2/CO2 they are \n\nlower. Also for AM-3-5 membrane, the separation factors for H2-containing mixtures were \n\nlower than ideal selectivities, whereas for N2/CO2 similar values were found. These results \n\nmay be due to difficulties in the quantification of H2 concentration, since H2 and He \n\n(reference gas for TCD of the GC) have similar thermal conductivities (0.1706 and 0.1502 \n\nW/(m.K), respectively) and therefore the intensity of the TCD signal is very weak. The H2 \n\nquantification is fundamental for the investigation of membranes capable to separate H2-\n\ncontaining mixtures. Hence, our research team is presently trying to overcome such \n\nlimitation. \n\n \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n 138 \n\nFigure VI.28 \u2013 Separation factors for AM-3-5 and AM-3-3 membranes as function of \ntemperature.

Conclusions and Future Work \n \n\nConclusions \n\nThe dynamic characterization of zeolite membranes by gas permeation experiments is an \n\nindispensible tool for the complete assessment of their quality. After the structural \n\ncharacterization, these tests allow us to detect the existence of macro, meso and even \n\nmicrodefects in new synthesized membranes. After that, the preparation conditions may be \n\ncontinuously optimized to obtain good quality membranes. This has been the motivation \n\nfor this dissertation.  \n\n In order to carry out permeation essays with pure gases and mixtures, an \n\nexperimental set-up has been designed, assembled, and tested. With relation to pure gases, \n\nthe main targets were the measurement of permeances at constant temperature, by varying \n\nthe transmembrane pressure drop, and permeances at programmed temperature, by fixing \n\nthe driving force. With respect to mixtures, the determination of the components mole \n\nfractions in the permeate and retentate demanded a GC which has been coupled later. In \n\nthe whole, H2, He, N2, CO2, and O2 have been utilized.  \n\n In this work, nineteen membranes and three different supports have been studied, \n\nnamely nine of AM-3, five of ETS-10, four of ZSM-5, and one of 4A-zeolite, and two \n\nsupports of ?-alumina, and one of stainless-steel. A first exploratory test with nitrogen at \n\nroom temperature has detected fifteen membranes with rough defects, which induced us to \n\nperform a second deposition on six of them, and a third crystallization onto the two \n\nmembranes. (The reference criterion for rejection was permeances higher than 610?  \n\n\n\nConclusions and Future Work \n\n 140 \n\nmol/m2s.Pa). For instance, the ETS-10 membranes no. 4 and 5 reduced their permeances \n\nfrom 4.81\u00d710-6  to less than 1\u00d710-9, and 7.10\u00d710-6  to 2.26\u00d710-8 mol/m2s.Pa, respectively. \n\nOn the contrary, AM-3-8, AM-3-9, and AM-3-10 membranes exhibited an apparently \n\ncontradictory result, since ?  values increased from 2.35\u00d710-7 to 1.30\u00d710-6, 2.96\u00d710-7 to \n\n9.62\u00d710-7, and 1.22\u00d710-6 to 6.38\u00d710-6 mol/m2s.Pa, respectively, attributed to the partial \n\ndissolution of the first formed titanosilicate layer, hindering a good intergrowth between \n\nneighbour crystals.  \n\n After the above mentioned essays, the most promising AM-3-3, AM-3-4, and AM-\n\n3-5 membranes were elected for further studies. The AM-3-4 membrane has been \n\ninvestigated with N2 at different pressure drops at 25, 100 and 140\u00baC, but the results \n\nrevealed it embodied a significant number of defects. Actually, the permeances at constant \n\ntemperature increased with increasing P? , which denoted viscous flow through \n\nmacropores.  \n\nThe experimental observations registered for the AM-3-3 membrane with H2, He, N2, \n\nand CO2 told that the prevailing transport mechanisms were viscous flow and Knudsen \n\ndiffusion. The T? ?  curves were monotonously decreasing, which is typical of both \n\ncontributions. Furthermore, the dominance of the Knudsen mechanism was verified by the \n\nlinear trend found between permeances and the inverse of the square root of the molecular \n\nweight. Concerning the viscous flow contribution, its dependence on gas viscosity implies \n\na subsequent relationship with kinetic diameter and molecular weight, which for Chapman-\n\nEnskog based equations is 2k\n5.0 dM? ? . The measured permeances roughly followed \n\n5.02\nk Md? ? , indicating some contribution from viscous flow, once v?  is inversely \n\nproportional to viscosity.  \n\nThe study of the AM-3-5 membrane with pure H2, N2, CO2, and O2 pointed out it \n\ncontains not only macro and mesodefects, but also intercrystalline micropores. Actually, \n\nthe constant permeances of N2, CO2, and O2 over temperature must rely on the necessary \n\nexistence of an activated diffusion to compensate the lowering viscous and Knudsen \n\ncomponents. Since the kinetic diameters of N2, CO2, and O2 are larger than the \n\nintracrystalline pores of AM-3, this proves the membrane have significant intercrystalline \n\nmicropores. The hydrogen permeation exhibited the desired exponential behaviour with \n\n\n\nConclusions and Future Work \n\n 141 \n\ntemperature, since its small diameter superimposes the intracrystalline activated diffusion \n\nwhich overlaps the negative contribution of viscous and Knudsen fluxes. Modelling \n\ncorroborated this phenomenological conclusion, showing that the last mechanisms were \n\nequivalent in magnitude and always descent, whereas the activated gaseous diffusion \n\nincreased significantly with increasing temperature.  \n\nThe ZSM-5 is known to adsorb CO2. This fact gives rise to a distinct permeating \n\nbehaviour, because the permeances decrease with increasing P?  in view of the fact the \n\nsurface loading concentrations increase non-linearly. These results were found for CO2 in \n\nZSM-5-1 membrane, whereas for N2 a constant permeance was measured.     \n\n  The calculated ideal selectivities, whose values ranged from ca. 1 to 4.2, have been \n\ncomputed with the individual permeances of the cited gases, allowing us to compare once \n\nmore the AM-3-3 and AM-3-5 membranes. E.g., for the H2/CO2 pair, the AM-3-3 \n\nmembrane gave *?  between 3.6 and 4.2 for 40\u2013120 \u00baC, while for AM-3-5 =?* 2.6-3.1 in \n\nthe same temperature interval. These results were expected in advance, since the \n\npredominance of the non-selective viscous flow in AM-3-5 penalizes the ideal separation \n\nfactors.  \n\nWith respect to the experimental selectivities of the H2-containing mixtures studied, \n\nthey were unfortunately lower than the ideal ones, which has been attributed to difficulties \n\nin the quantification of the H2. This problem could not be fixed in the short time after the \n\nupgrade of the installation for multicomponent mixtures.  \n\nIn order to increase the selectivities some essays have been carried out with AM-3-5 \n\nsaturated with water. The measurements clearly emphasized an expected enhancement \n\nafter humidification (e.g. from 2.6 to 4.6 for H2/CO2/AM-3-5), which vanished with \n\nincreasing temperature, because of the removal of the water molecules responsible for the \n\nblockage of some pores.  \n\nIn this work, modelling has been accomplished on the basis of the generalized \n\nMaxwell-Stefan (MS) equations, since it is simultaneously the most physically adequate \n\nand elegant approach to deal with multicomponent mixtures. In fact, new models have \n\nbeen derived in this thesis for gas transport across membranes and also for ion-exchange in \n\n\n\nConclusions and Future Work \n\n 142 \n\nmicroporous zeolite materials. The second application arose naturally in parallel to the \n\nmain focus of the dissertation, since the titanosilicates have been used in our group for the \n\nremoval of toxic metals from aqueous solutions, making available interesting data to \n\nmodel.  \n\nThe gas transport across porous membranes comprehends essentially five \n\ncontributions: viscous, Knudsen, molecular, activated gaseous and surface diffusions. As \n\nhas been mentioned above, the existence of macro and mesodefects in microporous \n\nmaterials denunciate the first two or three mechanisms. Interesting and desire contributions \n\nare the activated gaseous and surface diffusion. In this topic the knowledge of good \n\nmulticomponent isotherms, whether predicted from pure models or experimentally \n\nmeasured, is an essential step. In this work, new expressions were derived for the intrinsic \n\nMS thermodynamic factors of mono and multicomponent Nitta, Langmuir-Freundlich, and \n\nToth isotherms, in order to enlarge the application of the Maxwell-Stefan equations to the \n\npermeation of very dissimilar systems. In fact, the literature only presents equations for \n\npure and binary classical and dual site Langmuir. The new expressions were validated \n\nusing methane and ethane data from different sources for silicalite-1: equilibrium points for \n\neach gas in crystal, pure component fluxes through membrane, and binary fluxes also. \n\nFrom single isotherms, the multicomponent ones have been predicted; using pure \n\npermeation data the corresponding diffusion parameters have been optimized; finally, \n\ntaking into account the Vignes relation, the crossed MS diffusivities have been computed. \n\nThe new equations proposed here, together with previous parameters from independent \n\nexperiments, have successfully allowed us to estimate the binary fluxes of methane/ethane \n\nthrough silicalite-1. It is clear from the procedure described that this validation is \n\nundoubtedly very stringent. The results obtained pointed out the new models are able to \n\nrepresent data for pure substances and predict binary permeation fairly well and reliably. In \n\ncomparison with some better results reported for classical Langmuir, following an \n\nanalogous approach, it should be emphasized our calculations involve four parameters less.  \n\n In relation to ion exchange, the MS approach has been adopted due to their well \n\ndocumented advantages over Nernst-Planck relationships, particularly because it takes \n\naccount of ion-ion and ion-solid interactions. The new model proposed was validated with \n\nbatch experiments on mercury (II) and cadmium (II) removal from aqueous solution using \n\n\n\nConclusions and Future Work \n\n 143 \n\nETS-4 microporous titanosilicate. The relevant species are Hg2+ or Cd2+ and Na+ (initially \n\nin solution and in ETS-4, respectively), and titanosilicate ionic fixed charges. Results \n\nobtained provide good representations of metal ions concentration in solution and solid \n\nphase along time. Even the transition from the steep descent to the horizontal branch of \n\n0AA CC  versus time curves are well represented, precisely where kinetic curves are most \n\ndifficult to fit. The predicting ability of our MS based model has been also analyzed, being \n\npossible to conclude it performs very well. In effect, good predictions are accomplished \n\nwith parameters optimized from independent sets of data. Such performance may be \n\nattributed to the sound physical principles of Maxwell-Stefan theory. \n\n \n\nFuture Work \n\nSome suggestions for future work may be raised. It is important to measure isotherms for \n\npure gases and mixtures on titanosilicates due to their importance in the permeation \n\nphenomenon. After that, one may predict them by molecular simulations and compare \n\ncalculations with experimental data.  With respect to the experimental work, it is important \n\nto study the permeation of additional gases and mixtures as for instance H2/CH4 due to its \n\nimportance. It is crucial to fix the problem of the quantification of hydrogen in the \n\nmixtures. Only that will make viable an extension of the experimental programme to wider \n\nranges of operating conditions. As for equilibrium, the prediction of permeances of pure \n\nand mixed gases may be accomplished by molecular dynamics simulations, in order to \n\nreduce the experimental work load and avoid contact with dangerous molecules. Finally, it \n\nis important to test the performance of the proposed MS based model for multicomponent \n\nion exchange, and analyze its behaviour for concentrated solutions, where the Nernst-\n\nPlanck model is expected to fail. \n\n \n\n     \n\n   \n\n           \n\n\n\nReferences \n\n 145 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nVIII.
