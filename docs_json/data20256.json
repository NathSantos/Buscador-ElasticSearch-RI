Contudo, o uso intensivo destas tecnicas tem chamado a aten\u00e7\u00e3o p\u00fablica para o \nproblema da contamina\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental devido \u00e0 saliniza\u00e7\u00e3o de camadas mais profundas do \nsolo e dos aqu\u00edferos. Recentemente surgiu uma nova tecnica limpa e amientalmente \u00fatil, em \nque esp\u00e9cies removedoras de sal (i\u00f5es) s\u00e3o plantadas ou semeadas nos solos salinos e t\u00eam \nsido utilizadas para remover o sal dos solos. A capacidade de remo\u00e7\u00e3o de sal de Portulaca \noleracea Golden Purslane e sete plantas natives locais - Tamarix hispida, Apocynum \nlancifolium, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Portulaca oleracea Green Purslane, Alhagi pseudalhagi, \nKarelinia caspia, e Chenopodium album foram testadas neste estudo. Os ensaios de campo \nforam efectuados na regi\u00e3o Khoresm, no norte do Uzbequist\u00e3o, durante o Ver\u00e3o, o per\u00edodo \nmais sens\u00edvel para os solos salinos. . A Portulaca oleracea golden purslane foi semeada em \ndois solos salinos diferentes, um deles regado e o outro de sequeiro. A colheita foi realizada \nduas vezes, ao longo da fase de crescimento e na da fase de frutifica\u00e7\u00e3o da . Portulaca \noleracea golden purslane. Os resultados mostraram que a  cultura de sequeiro removeu uma \nquantidade mais alta de sais e a sua produ\u00e7\u00e3o foi superior. Isto deve-se \u00e0 ascens\u00e3o da \u00e1gua \ncapilar, que resultou numa contribui\u00e7\u00e3o significativa para as necessidades h\u00eddricas das \nplantas, aumentando a sua transpira\u00e7\u00e3o. A maxima remo\u00e7\u00e3o de sal variou de 496.6 a 511.3 \nkg ha-1 na fase de crescimento e na fase de frutifica\u00e7\u00e3o da Portulaca oleracea, que \neventualmente removeu cerca de 16.8 % do total de sais no solo, a 10 cm de profundidade. \nA mais eficiente planta nativa na remo\u00e7\u00e3o de sal foi a C.album. Esta planta removeu 538.4 \na 596.6 kg ha-1 na fase de crescimento e na fase de frutifica\u00e7\u00e3o, a uma profundidade de 25 \ncm, respectivamente, Este estudo mostrou que a Portulaca oleracea golden purslane (maior \nquantdade de sais) e a Chenpodium album (extrac\u00e7\u00e3o mais profunda de sais) podem vir a \nser potenciais esp\u00e9cies usadas para controlar e combater a salinidade nas regi\u00f5es do norte \ndo Uzbequist\u00e3o e poder\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m vir a ser integradas nos programas de cultivo e de \nrota\u00e7\u00e3o na para a remedia\u00e7\u00e3o dos solos salinos.  \n \n \n \n \n \nPalavra-chaves: Saliniza\u00e7\u00e3o do solo, fitoremedia\u00e7\u00e3o, esp\u00e9cise removedoras de sal, tecnicas \nconvencionais, tecnicas limpas.  \n\n\n\n ix\n\nABSTRACT \n\nConventional techniques, namely soil leaching and the use of enhancing fertilization are \nmethods used to mitigate soil salinity and to increase the salt tolerance of agricultural crops \ngrown in salt-affected soils. However, the intensive use of these techniques has also \nattracted public attention due to the environmental pollution caused and the contamination \nof groundwater resources. Recently, a new environmentally safe and clean remediation \ntechnique, whereby salt (ion) removing species are planted in the salt-affected soils, has \nbeen introduced to address salinity problems. The salt removal potential of Portulaca \noleracea Golden Purslane and seven native naturally grown wild plants - Tamarix hispida, \nApocynum lancifolium, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Portulaca oleracea Green Purslane, Alhagi \npseudalhagi, Karelinia caspia, and Chenopodium album have been evaluated under this \nstudy. The field experiments were carried out in the Khorezm Region, in the northwest of \nUzbekistan, during the summer, the most sensitive period for salt-affected soils. Portulaca \noleracea golden purslane was planted in two different salt-affected soils, one field with \nirrigation and one without irrigation. The harvest was twice, in the developing and seedling \nstages of Portulaca oleracea golden purslane. The results have revealed that no irrigation \nwas required to remove the highest soil salts and to obtain the highest biomass in Portulaca \noleracea golden purslane. The capillary rise from groundwater played a significant role in \nmeeting the demand of plants for water, increasing plant transpiration. The highest salt \naccumulation varied from 496.6 up to 511.3 kg ha-1 in the developing and seedling phases \nof Portulaca oleracea, which eventually, removed about 16.8 % of the total soil salts, at a \ndepth of 10 cm. The most efficient wild plant in removing salts from the soil was C.album.  \nThis plant removed 538.4 up to 596.6 kg ha-1 at a depth of 25 cm, in the developing and \nseedling stages, respectively. The study indicated that Portulaca oleracea golden purslane \n(higher amount of salts) and Chenopodium album (deeper salts extraction) could become \npotential species used to control and to combat salinity in the northern part of Uzbekistan \nand could also be integrated into cultivation/rotation programmes to remediate saline soils. \n \n \n \n \n \nKeywords: Soil salination, phytoremediation, salt removing species, conventional \ntechniques, clean techniques. \n\n\n\n x\n\nOUTLINE OF THE THESIS \n \n\nThis thesis is structured into five sections. Firstly, a general introduction describing the \n\nbackground to agriculture in Uzbekistan, soil salinity and the aims of this study. Following \n\nthis general introduction, the second section provides a summary of previous investigations \n\nconducted by other scientists on conventional and phytoremediation techniques used \n\nthroughout the world to address soil salinity as well as in Uzbekistan. The aim is to \n\nfacilitate understanding of the whole concept of salt removal species. Section 3 presents \n\nand discusses the geographical, climatic and other key characteristics of a field study in the \n\nKhorezm region of Uzbekistan. This section also describes the plantation of Portulaca \n\noleracea golden purslane in two different salt-affected soils of the study region with two \n\ndifferent irrigation practices to determine potential capacity to remove soil salts. Moreover, \n\nselection and analysis of native wild species are also explained in the current section. \n\nSection 4 provides details of the results obtained from the field experiments. Furthermore, \n\nbiomass production and potential salt removal efficiencies of P.oleracea and other native \n\nnaturally grown species are highlighted in this section. Section 5 provides overall \n\nconclusions and recommendations towards the remediation of soil salts in the northern part \n\nof Uzbekistan. \n\n\n\n xi\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n Page\n\n List of figures..\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026.\u2026.. xiii \n   \n List of tables...\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026. xv \n   \n List of symbols and abbreviations\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026... xvi \n   \n\nI.

The economic impacts resulting from \n\nsalinity are mainly associated with a decrease in the production capacity of land. The \n\nnegative environmental impacts are most often the degradation of land, namely soil \n\nsalination and groundwater contamination. \n\nSoil salination is a major threat to the environment and is especially problematic where \n\nhuman interventions have disturbed natural ecosystems. Anthropogenic activities have \n\nincreased soil salinity by changing the natural balance of the water cycle, by allowing \n\nexcess recharging of groundwater and salt accumulation through its concentration (Justin \n\nMurphy, 1999). Moreover, groundwater contamination is also an important negative \n\nenvironmental impact, which is intensified by seawater intrusion in coastal zones (Ben \n\nAsher et al., 2002).  \n\nWith a land mass covering 447,400 square kilometer, Uzbekistan is one of the countries in \n\nCentral Asia most heavily reliant on irrigated agriculture. The contribution of agriculture to \n\nthe national economy is 24.1% of Gross National Product (GNP), 60% of foreign currency \n\nincome, and 45% of employment (Uzgipromeliovodhoz, 2003). The total land area of \n\nUzbekistan amounts to 44.7 million hectares of which 4.3 million hectares are potentially \n\nsuitable for irrigation (Uzgipromeliovodhoz, 2003). Almost 85% of Uzbekistan\u2019s territory \n\nis covered by desert or semi-desert, including the largest desert in Central Asia, the \n\n\u201cThe ground \u2013 is not only a huge property, but it is also a  \n  key factor of which this country depends\u201d. \n\n         I.A.KARIMOV \n  President of Republic of UZBEKISTAN \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n 2\n\nKyzylkum Desert. The most serious threat to agricultural production and ecosystem safety \n\nin the north of Uzbekistan is high salt accumulation and secondary salinization of irrigated \n\nsoil. This has mostly resulted due to the mis-management of water and land resources over \n\nthe last forty years (Szabolcs, 1989). More than half of the 2.32 million hectares of irrigated \n\nland in Uzbekistan is salt-affected and the build-up salinity is seriously threatening \n\nagricultural productivity (ICARDA, 2002). Every year, 75 million tons of salt is spreading \n\nwith a 1000 km radius and into other Central Asian countries (Shadimetov, 2006). The \n\nmain causes for this are identified as the shrinking of the Aral Sea, seawater intrusion \n\ntowards the land, long-term irrigation, inappropriate drainage systems and global climate \n\nchanges. \n\nBefore the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Uzbekistan was a major producer of \n\ncotton, which is one of the most salt-tolerant crops. In order to obtain an increasing amount \n\nof cotton, the country was using enormous amounts of water resources from the two main \n\nrivers \u2013 the Amudarya and the Syrdarya. These rivers supply the Aral Sea. Furthermore, \n\nfarmers have been pursuing extensive agricultural development through the use of high \n\nlevels of fertilizers and pesticides in order to increase crop productivity. The consequences \n\nof using enormous amounts of water resources and heavy application of chemicals has \n\nresulted in rising groundwater tables, salinization and the well-known ecological disaster \n\naround the Aral Sea (Toderich et al., 2002). Moreover, low irrigation efficiencies \u2013 caused \n\nby unlined canals and a poor drainage networks \u2013 has led to major waterlogging and \n\nsalinization that has now affected about 55 percent of irrigated land in the country (FAO, \n\n1998).  \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n 3\n\nDue to long-term irrigation and poor drainage systems, the salinity of irrigated areas in the \n\nnorthern part of Uzbekistan has amounted to 100 percent in the Khorezm region and to 94.3 \n\npercent in Karakalpakstan region (Uzgipromeliovodhoz, 2002).  \n\nThe Khorezm region has been selected as the focus of this thesis study as it is one of the \n\nareas in Central Asia most strongly affected by secondary soil salinization. In this region, \n\nthe dominant approaches adopted by farmers to mitigate salinity is to apply excessive \n\namounts of water to salt-affected fields in order to leach the salts into the root zone \n\nallowing infiltration of salts to deeper layers. This approach has two potential outcomes \u2013 \n\nfirstly, when there is an impermeable layer, salts are accumulated above this layer and \n\nsecondly, when there is no impermeable layer, groundwater contamination can be observed \n\n(Ayers and Westcot, 1985; Ben Mechlia, 2002). When soils become highly saline, farmers \n\ntend to abandon the salt-affected fields resulting in large tracks of saline/waterlogged soils \n\n(Kushiev et al., 2005). \n\nAn alternative approach used in the region to combat salinity and to maximize agricultural \n\ncrop production is the heavy application of fertilizers; in this case the tolerance of plants to \n\nsaline conditions is increased, but contamination by hazardous chemicals will also be \n\nincreased due to the higher amount of fertilizers applied (Beltrao et al., 2002).  \n\nIt was reported by World Bank that annually significant irrigated land is taken out of crop \n\nproduction due to salinization. The rehabilitation of these salinised areas requires major \n\ntechnical expertise and financial investment. The rehabilitation cost has been assessed by \n\nthe World Bank to be more than USD $ 3 billion (World Bank, 2003).   \n\nIn recent years, a new environmentally safe and clean technique known as \n\nphytoremediation has been introduced to address the salinity problem. This includes the \n\nintroduction of salt (ion) removing species to control salinity and to maintain the \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n 4\n\nsustainability of landscapes and agricultural fields (Cuartero et al., 2002; Shaaban &amp; El \n\nFourly, 2002).  Phytoremediation is defined as the use of plants to remove pollutants from \n\nthe environment and to render them harmless (Salt et al., 1998). Large-scale \n\ndecontamination of soils and underground water using phytoremediation techniques \n\nrequires plants with high salt uptake rates, large biomass and tolerance to a wide array of \n\nenvironmental conditions and constraints. Moreover, the creation of highly productive \n\nfodder systems1 through the establishment of palatable halophytes2 has been shown to \n\nremediate saline/sodic soils3 as well as provide an income resource to poor farmers (Hyder, \n\n1981; Helalia et al., 1992; Dagar et al., 2004). \n\nThe best way to select salt removing species is to assess native naturally grown halophytic \n\nspecies since the salt tolerance of a plant relates to its resistance and ability to grow under \n\nconditions of high winds, salt spray, alkaline soils and infertile sandy soils. In addition, the \n\nuse of halophytes has great potential for landscaping and building greenification4 in high \n\nsaline areas. \n\nThe main aim of this work is to develop recommendations for soil remediation for the \n\nnorthern region of Uzbekistan and to rehabilitate salt-affected soils using phytoremediation \n\ntechniques. The specific research objectives are as follows: \n\n\u2022 to evaluate Portulaca oleracea golden purslane in the salt-affected soils of northern \n\nUzbekistan for its ability to remove salts; \n\n                                                 \n1 Any plants and crops that is used specifically to feed livestock, such as cattle, sheep, horses and chickens \n2 Salt tolerant species that have a good enough taste to be eaten or drunk \n3 A nonsaline soil containing sufficient exchangeable sodium (Na+) to adversely affect crop production and \nsoil structure under most conditions of soil and plant type.

According to several reports, there is a total area of 987.5 \n\nmillion hectares in the world occupied by problematic soils, and around 322.9 million \n\nhectares are considered as saline and sodic soils (Brinkman, 1980). As an example of this \n\nproblem, Szabolcs (1989) reported that 10 percent of the world\u2019s arable land is on saline \n\nalkali soils. Soil salinization is a major problem in Uzbekistan and consequently, irrigated \n\narea is being tremendously damaged. \n\nBroadly, many international researches indicated that salinity management can be \n\nconsidered in a two stage process: 1) Use of conventional techniques \u2013 soil leaching, \n\ncombination of salts and fertilizers, subsurface trickle irrigation, and salt tolerant species, \n\nand 2) Application of new clean and environmentally useful techniques \u2013 salt removing \n\nspecies, drought tolerant crops and regulated deficit irrigation. \n\n \n\nII.1 \u2013 Conventional Techniques \n\nII.1.1 - Soil Leaching \n\nLeaching is practiced for reclamation and for maintaining salt balance in the soil by \n\nirrigation water application (Pereira, et al., 1996). Moreover, Gupta and Chandra (1972) \n\nstated that due to world shortages of freshwater, saving in freshwater can be achieved by \n\nperforming part of the leaching with saline water which is less saline than the soil to be \n\nleached. Thus, it is important to establish the threshold salinities of water draining from the \n\nroot zone to determine leaching requirements. Meanwhile, to estimate leaching \n\nrequirements, both the irrigation water salinity (ECw) and the crop tolerance to soil salinity \n\n\n\nLiterature Review \n\n 7 \n \n\nFig II.1 - Salinity Control by Leaching  \n       in the Experimental Field\n\n(ECe) should be known, which can be estimated in the laboratory conditions. The necessary \n\nleaching requirement (LR) can be estimated for a particular crop by using the following \n\nequation (Rhoades, 1974; and Rhoades &amp; Merill, 1976): \n\n \n\n \n\nwhere:       LR    -     the minimum leaching requirement needed to control salts within the \n\ntolerance (ECe) of the crop with ordinary surface methods of irrigation \n\n       ECw   -  salinity of the applied irrigation water in dS m-1 \n\n      ECe    -  average soil salinity tolerated by the crop as measured on a soil \n\nsaturation extract (dS m-1) \n\nMoreover, the total annual depth of water that needs to be applied to meet both the crop \n\ndemand and leaching requirement should be identified. The following equation can be used \n\nfor that: \n\n \nwhere:       AW - depth of applied water (mm year-1) \n\n       ET  -  total annual crop water demand (mm year-1) \n\n       LR -   leaching requirement \n\nIn general, soil salinity in many other \n\nregions of Uzbekistan as well as in the \n\nstudy region is controlled by leaching of the \n\nsoil with extra freshwater since the study \n\nregion is highly affected by salinity (Fig. \n\nII.1). Djanibekov (2005) pointed out that on \n\naverage, 4300 m3 ha-1 of water is applied \n\nfor leaching on 85 % of the irrigated land in Khorezm. However, intense use of this \n\nleaching technique attracted public awareness of environmental pollution and the impact on \n\nLR\nET\n\nAW\n?\n\n=\n1\n\nECwECe\nECw\n\nLR\n??\n\n=\n)(5\n\n(II.1)\n\n(II.2)\n\n\n\nLiterature Review \n\n 8 \n \n\naquifers. For instance, UKPC (2002) mentioned that application of huge amounts of water \n\nto wash the salts from the soil in Khorezm led to raise the groundwater level near the \n\nsurface resulting in large amount of salts moving from the lower soil strata to the surface \n\nlayers. Consequently, this strategy increases the risk of resalinization in the root zone. As a \n\nresult, soil leaching process has to be repeated every cropping season in order to avoid \n\nbuild-up of high salt concentration. \n\nFurthermore, after leaching, water runs into the drainage systems and when the salt-\n\ncontaminated drainage water returns to the Amudarya River, it has severe impact on the \n\necosystems of the river and wetlands. It can be presumed that drainage water contains not \n\nonly salt but also pesticide residue, fertilizers, defoliants and other agrochemicals, which \n\nenter the rivers, destroys the fine balance of nature and deteriorates water quality in these \n\nwater bodies. \n\n \nII.1.2 - Combination of Salts and Fertilizers \n\nThe application of fertilizers, namely nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) has become an \n\nalternative approach for farmers to combat soil salinity and to maximize agricultural crop \n\nproduction. Enhanced fertilization leads to increase of plant salinity tolerance. \n\nInitially, Mass and Hoffman (1977) proposed that the effect of salinity on yield could be \n\ndescribed with a piece-wise linear response function characterized by a salinity \u201cthreshold\u201d \n\nvalue below which the yield is unaffected by soil salinity and above which yield decreases \n\nlinearly as salt concentrations increase (Fig. II.2). Later on, Beltrao et al. (2002) have \n\nmodeled the combined effects of salts and nitrogen (N) on the crop yield function and \n\nproved that tolerance (threshold salinity value) for N1 is lower than for N2, which means \n\nthat relative yield maintains constant at 100% until C for N1 and D for N2 (Fig. II.3). On the \n\n\n\nLiterature Review \n\n 9 \n \n\nother hand, sensitivity (rate of yield reduction per unit of salinity) is larger for N1 than for \n\nN2, which interprets with the higher values of the salinity threshold, the relative yield \n\ndecreases sharply until zero. \n\nIn addition, Mass and Hoffman (1977) proposed that relative crop yield Yr (%) for any \n\ngiven soil salinity exceeding the threshold could be calculated according to the following \n\nformula: \n\n \nwhere:  b  -  the slope represents the crop sensitivity (yield losses per unit increase of \n\nelectrical conductivity). \n\n  a  -  the salinity threshold value (crop tolerance, expressed in dS m-1). \n\n  ECe \u2013 the mean electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract of root zone. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn addition, Achilea (2002) stated that constant application of potassium nitrate is an \n\nefficient method of preventing salinity-induced stresses in many crops. However, one of the \n\nmain negative consequences of enhanced fertilization to mitigate soil salinity is to increase \n\nof environmental contamination through chemical hazards (Beltrao &amp; Ben Asher, 1997). \n\n \nII.1.3 - Subsurface Trickle Irrigation \n\nThe interest in subsurface trickle irrigation (STI) has increased significantly in recent \n\ndecades primarily due to increased pressure to conserve water resources and to control \n\n)(100 aECebYr ??=\n\nECe\n\n50 \n\na \n\nb \n\n 100 \n\n0 \n\nY\nr \n\nFig. II.2 - Crop Relative Yield Affected by the \nSalinity of the Soil (Mass and Hoffman, 1977)\n\nY\nr \n\nDC\nN2 \n\nN2 \n\nN1 \n\nN1 \n\nECe \n\n50 \n\n 100 \n\n0\n\nFig. II.3 - Relative Yield Response to the \nCombined Effects of Salinity and Nitrogen \n\n(Beltrao et al., 2002) \n\n(II.3)\n\n\n\nLiterature Review \n\n 10 \n \n\nsalinity. This conventional technique, the application of water below the soil surface \n\nthrough emitters, allows for the direct application of water into the plant root-zones \n\nachieving more manageable, balanced water distribution throughout a relative shallow soil \n\nprofile, hence minimizing potential groundwater depletion (Gushiken, 1995). Furthermore, \n\nSTI reduces losses to evaporation from the soil surface, economizes water resources, and \n\nless additional salts will be used. Lamm (2002) highlighted that STI technique is also useful \n\nfor controlling weeds and the enhancement of plant growth, crop yield and quality.  \n\nHowever, Oron and Beltrao (1993) pointed out that the problem of groundwater \n\ncontamination due to natural rain or artificial leaching remains. In addition, Lamm (2002) \n\npointed out that SDI may restrict plant root development and tillage operation may also be \n\nlimited by dripline placement. \n\nII.1.4 - Salt Tolerant Species \n\nIn most developing countries, due to the expansion of population, fertile soils and fresh \n\nwater resources are becoming insufficient. Besides, Shay (1990) mentioned that saline soil \n\nareas are continuously increasing throughout the world. About over 2 million hectares are \n\naffected by salinity in Uzbekistan. For the Solonchak soils to achieve economically viable \n\nand environmentally non-degradable land, many scientists have proposed to use salt \n\ntolerant species. The use of salt tolerant species, or halophytes, has great potential for \n\nlandscaping and building greenification in the salt affected soils. Meanwhile, Lieth et al. \n\n(1997) stated that a number of halophytes are also useful for food, feed and ornamental \n\npurposes. Black (2004) pointed out that salt tolerant species have the ability to resist and \n\ngrow under high winds, salt spray, alkaline soils9 and infertile, sandy soil conditions. \n\n                                                 \n9 Soil containing soluble salts of magnesium, calcium, sodium, or the like, and having a pH higher than 7. \nCommonly found in low-rainfall regions. \n\n\n\nLiterature Review \n\n 11 \n \n\nIn addition, Akjigitova (1981) and Hinsinger (1998) highlighted that halophytic plants are \n\ncapable of producing high biomass production under saline conditions.  \n\nMass and Hoffman (1977) divided the crops into four salinity rating groups: sensitive, \n\nmoderately sensitive, moderately tolerant and tolerant (Table II.1).  \n\nTable II.1 - Threshold and Zero Yield Salinity Levels for four Salinity Groups \n\nSalinity rating Threshold salinity dS m-1 \nZero Yield level  \n\ndS m-1 \n\nSensitive 1.4 8.0 \n\nModerately sensitive 3.0 16.0 \n\nModerately tolerant 6.0 24.0 \n\nTolerant 10.0 32.0 \n \nMoreover, they described salinity groups by plotting its relative yield as a continuous \n\nfunction of average rootzone salinity ECe (Fig. II.4). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nECe \n\nECw \n\n20 15105 0 \n\n20 15105 0 \n\nR\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nC\n\nro\np \n\nY\nie\n\nld\n,  \n\n%\n \n\n100 \n0 35 30 252015105 \n\n80 \n\n60 \n\n40 \n\n20 \n\n0 35 30 252015105 \n\nSENSITIVE MODERATELY \n  SENSITIVE \n\nMODERATELY \n  TOLERANT \n\nTOLERANT \n\nECe = Electrical Conductivity    \n           of the Saturation   \n           Extract (dS m-1) \n \nECw = Electrical Conductivity    \n           of the Irrigation   \n           Water (dS m-1) \n \n           ECe = 1.5 ECw \n\nECw \n\nECe \n\n0 \n\ndS m-1 \n\nFig. II.4 - Response of Relative Crop Yield (or Yield Potential) as a \nFunction of Average Rootzone Salinity (ECe) Grouped According Relative \n\nTolerance or Sensitivity to Salinity (Ayers &amp; Westcot, 1985) \n\nUNSUITABLE \nFOR CROPS \n\n\n\nLiterature Review \n\n 12 \n \n\nAs seen, the use of salt tolerant species is a useful technique to combat with salinity in the \n\nsalt-affected zones. However, Hamdy (2002) highlighted that it does not solve the problem \n\nof soil salinity and groundwater contamination. \n\n \n\nII.2 - Clean and Environmentally Useful Techniques \n\nII.2.1 - Salt Removing Species \n\nPhytoremediation \u2013 salt removing species have become the best technique to remediate \n\nsaline soils and decontaminate the environment (Anac et al., 2005).  Ebbs and Kochian \n\n(1997) pointed out that the ideal plant to remediate salt affected soils would be a high \n\nbiomass producing crop that can not only tolerate but also accumulate the salts. High salt \n\nuptake species potentially could be integrated into cultivation/rotation programmes. \n\nIn recent years, Matjanova (1999) and Davletmuradova (2002) investigated naturally grown \n\nwild desert plants in Karakalpakstan (north of Uzbekistan) as potential salt removing \n\nspecies and proposed dividing them into five categories according to their halo-adaptation \n\nand halo-tolerance: hyper-halophytes (may accumulate 21-29 % of soluble salts from soil), \n\neuhalophytes (12 - 13 %), hemi-halophytes (10.2 - 10.9 %), halo-glycophytes (6.2 \u2013 8.3 %) \n\nand glycophytes (3.6 \u2013 5.1 %). However, the main concern of their research was \n\nontogenetic10 aspects of the wild species. \n\nIn general, this new technique to mitigate salinity is a powerful and environmentally clean \n\ntool to maintain the sustainability of the agricultural areas and landscapes (Neves et al., \n\n2005). However, there is lack of information regarding this technique, and, additional \n\nresearch is needed. \n\n                                                 \n10 Origin and development of individual plant species \n\n\n\nLiterature Review \n\n 13 \n \n\nII.2.2 - Drought Tolerant Species \n\nDrought and high salinity are common stress conditions that adversely affect plant growth \n\nand crop production (Xiong et al., 2002).  In both cases, the ability of plants to take up \n\nwater is restricted and this leads to reduction of growth rate. Moreover, as the global \n\nclimate is rapidly changing towards longer dry seasons and infrequent rainfall, it is \n\nanticipated that such changes will affect water supply to the plants, especially in arid and \n\nsemi-arid zones (Farooq &amp; Azam, 2001). As Gassemi et al. (1995) pointed out, crop \n\nproductivity in most of the areas has already been affected by salinity. Any further \n\ndeterioration induced by drought might result in the collapse of agricultural systems. In \n\nrecent years, many researchers stated that induction of drought tolerant species could \n\npotentially be the best method to avoid this. \n\nGenerally, \u201cdrought tolerant species\u201d refers to plants which are associated with tolerance of \n\nwater-deficit stress and well adapted to high temperatures and other abiotic stresses. Since \n\nthey consume less water, naturally fewer salts will be infiltrated into the soil. \n\nIn reality, the most drought tolerant species are usually the plants native to the specific area. \n\nWith the help of initiatives from the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources of \n\nUzbekistan, drought tolerant species have been introduced into 500 hectares to afforest and \n\nto protect forest belts on the dried seafloor near the Aral Sea in the northern part of \n\nUzbekistan. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nLiterature Review \n\n 14 \n \n\nII.2.3 - Deficit Irrigation \n\nIntensive irrigation of agricultural crops with high level of water mineralization causes salts \n\nto accumulate in the root zones, which adversely affects the crop productivity. In order to \n\nreduce such negative impacts, a regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) technique was adopted to \n\ncombat salinization in the arid and semi-arid environments by reducing the water \n\napplication during certain growth stages of the crops (Cameron et al., 2006). Furthermore, \n\nBen Mechila (2002) pointed out that one way to control or at least to postpone salinization \n\nin horticulture is the use of RDI. He also mentions that development of small irrigation \n\nschemes in the saline soils could be the best way to manage the field properly. Occasional \n\nheavy rains may also help take salts from this small area to places where they can \n\nconcentrate with a minimum effect on the natural resources. Meanwhile, Beltrao et al. \n\n(1999) proposed that RDI can be obtained in two cases: 1) decrease the amount of added \n\nsalt by reducing irrigation water supply, which also improves agricultural productivity and, \n\n2) apply minimal levels of water to obtain a good visual appearance (GVA) of the \n\nlandscape. \n\nThe proper application of less water to the plants can generate significant savings in \n\nirrigation water allocation and apparently, less salts will be infiltrated (Kirda, 2000). \n\nMoreover, they classified some crops as tolerance to less irrigation water either throughout \n\nthe growing season or at pre-determined growth stages taking into account yield response.  \n\nIn addition, Costa et al.

The region covers an area of about \n\n6,100 km2 and is spread between 40.49 and 41.97 N and 60.21 and 62.18 E of the \n\nGreenwich meridian, or about 245 km south of the remainders of the Aral Sea (Fig. III.1). \n\n     \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Fig. III.1 - Location of the Study Region \n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n 17 \n \n\nAmudarya River is a supplier of water for the whole Khorezm Region and in the last years, \n\nthe water amount has been tremendously reduced because of intensive upstream utilization \n\n(Djalalov et al., 2005). The river provides irrigation water for 231 000 ha of which more \n\nthan 12 % are severely saline. The region contributes to 15% of the national Uzbekistan \n\nriver water withdrawals. And water withdrawal for agriculture is estimated at 94% of the \n\nwhole regional water withdrawals (Schieder, 2004).  \n\nThe region has become particularly vulnerable to short and long-term droughts, as a result \n\nduring the 2000 and 2001 growing seasons resulted in major crop failures (WHO, 2001). \n\nConsequently, the agricultural Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has become one of the \n\nlowest in Uzbekistan (Djalalov et al., 2005). Moreover, the socio-economic and public \n\nhealth situation in the region has been worsening due to geographical proximity to the \n\necologically degraded Aral Sea (Khamzina 2006). \n\nKhorezm borders with Autonomous Republic of Karakalpakistan in the North and East, \n\nwith Turkmenistan in the South and West, with the Bukhara region in the South and East. \n\nThe population of the region is equal to 1 324 000 people, 24% of which reside in towns \n\nand the density is equal to 217,4 people per km2 (Gulomov et al., 2001). The population \n\ngrowth rate has averaged 2.8% over the past 11 years (MMS, 1999). The Khorezm region \n\nis divided into ten administrative districts with Urgench as the administrative center. The \n\npopulation of Urgench is equal to 139 000 people whereas experimental district\u2019s (Gurlan) \n\npopulation is around 27 300 people. About 80% of Khorezm\u2019s population resides in rural \n\nareas and is engaged in cotton production, which is the main cultivated crop for that region, \n\nfollowed by winter wheat, rice and various other crops.  \n\n \n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n 18 \n \n\nIII.2 \u2013 Climatic Conditions \n\nThe study area is situated in the Central Asian semi desert zone with an extremely \n\ncontinental climate (Glazirin et al., 1999). Potential evapotranspiration exceed precipitation \n\nduring the most parts of the year. It is also considered as daily temperature fluctuation \n\nregion with long hot dry summers, infrequent rains in spring-autumn and very cold \n\ntemperatures during winter. Annual precipitation of the region is determined as 100-120 \n\nmm, which falls mostly outside of growing season in autumn-winter period (Fig. III.2). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLocal potential evapotranspiration (ET) is about 1,600 mm/year greatly exceeds \n\nprecipitation (Glavgidromet, 2006). Thus, large scale irrigation for cultivated crops is \n\nessential to this area. The mean annual air temperature (T) is 13\no\nC, whereas monthly \n\naverage maximum and minimum temperatures can reach + 37\no \n\nC and \u2013 13\no \n\nC, respectively \n\n(Fig. III.3). \n\n \n\nFig. III. 2 - Average Monthly Precipitation for the Period of 2000-2006 in the \nStudy Area (Source: Urgench Meteorological Station) \n\nPrecipitation in the study area\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\nI II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X XI XII\n\nMonths\n\nR\nai\n\nn\nfa\n\nll\n, m\n\nm\n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n 19 \n \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nVII VIII IX\nMonths\n\nA\nir\n\n te\nm\n\np\ner\n\nat\nu\n\nre\n, o\n\nC\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\nmax T min T RH\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDuring the experimental study, maximum daily T was 40,8\no\nC whilst minimum was 7,7\n\no \nC. \n\nThe hottest month of experimental period was July with average maximum T of 34\no \n\nC. \n\nMeanwhile, average monthly RH ranged from 38 to 47 % (Fig. III.4). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. III.4 - Average Monthly Air Relative Humidity (RH), Maximum (max T) \nand Minimum (min T) Air Temperatures at the Experimental Site during July, \n\nAugust, September 2006 (Source: Glavgidromet, 2006) \n\nA\nir\n\n re\nla\n\ntiv\ne \n\nhu\nm\n\nid\nity\n\n, %\n \n\nFig. III.3 - Average Monthly Maximum and Minimum Air Temperatures (max T \nand min T) and Air Relative Humidity (RH) for the Period of 2000-2006 in the \n\nStudy Area (Source: Urgench Meteorological Station) \n\nA\nir\n\n r\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nhu\n\nm\nid\n\nit\ny,\n\n %\n \n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\nI II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X XI XII\n\nMonths\n\nA\nir\n\n te\nm\n\npe\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n, o\nC\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\nmax T min T RH\n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n 20 \n \n\n)a100(*)25T(*K*0018.0 2 ?+=pET\n\nPotential evapotranspiration (ETp) greatly exceeded from rainfall during the study period. \n\nMonthly rainfall varied from 0.5 to 1.4 mm, whereas ETp varied from 146.4 to 242.3 mm \n\n(Fig. III.5). The modern and accurate method to compute ETp is Penman-Monteith \n\nequation recommended by FAO-56 (Allen et al., 1998).

The size of the land \n\nwas 16 m2 for field 1 and 49 m2 for field 2. Furthermore, field 3 was used for naturally \n\ngrown wild species. The experiment was held in the lands of Vazir Water Users \n\nAssociations (WUA), Gurlan city. In this study, field 1 was not irrigated while field 2 was \n\nirrigated twice with 0.78 dS m-1 salinity level of canal water. Irrigation was of 30 and 25 \n\nmin duration which allowed the soil to be completely saturated and flow rates were 0.438 \n\nand 0.144 m3 min-1. A research was carried out for three months of summer period (July, \n\nAugust and September) and the duration of the experiment was 49 days for field 1 and 58 \n\ndays for field 2. \n\nThe plants were harvested twice, in the developing and seedling stages of Portulaca \n\noleracea golden purslane. Meanwhile, selected native naturally grown wild species were \n\nharvested at the same time of that P.oleracea golden purslane to evaluate their efficiency to \n\nremove salts. \n\nIn both cases, all plant samples were \n\ntaken, plant height was measured, they \n\nwere weighed, washed with tap water \n\nand distilled water, oven dried at 70O C \n\nfor 48 hours (Fig. III.6), re-weighed, \n\nfinely ground in a mill and used for \n\nanalysis of chloride (Cl\n-\n), sodium (Na+), \n\npotassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), and \n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n 22 \n \n\nFig. III.7 - Soil Sampling \n\nmagnesium (Mg2+). The levels of Na+ and K+ were determined by flame photometry, whilst \n\nthe remaining cations were assessed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry using a \n\nShimadzu, AA-680 model spectrometer. Chloride (Cl\n-\n) ions were determined in the \n\naqueous extract by potentiometer using a Crison, pH meter GLP 22 after extraction in cold \n\nwater. \n\n \n\nIII.4 - Soil and Water Measurement \n\nFood and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) have classified four \n\ndifferent types of soil in Khorezm Region: mostly aridic and gleyic calcaric (sodic) \n\nArenosols and calcaric Cambisols, whilst gleyic humus Fluvisols are commonly originated \n\nalong the Amudarya River (Khamzina, 2006). In most cases, the thickness of alluvial \n\nsediments in or nearby to the river bed have 35-70 cm thick sands whereas former lake \n\nlocations are characterized by loam and clay (Fayzullaev, 1980). Total Nitrogen and \n\nPhosphorus contents in these soil types are very low, usually ranging between 0.03 - 0.15% \n\nand 0.060 - 0.18%, respectively. Since the natural fertility of the soils in the region is \n\nrelatively low, thus, heavy applications of chemical fertilizers are required in order to \n\ncultivate agricultural crops. \n\nSoils were sampled by horizon (stratification) in three places of each site to describe the \n\nsoil profile (Fig. III.7). Three 0.5 m deep pits were located in two P.oleracea fields, \n\nrepresenting both ends and the middle of the experimental site, and \n\none  0.5 m deep pit was dug in each field of naturally grown wild \n\nspecies. The soil sample was collected from 5 soil layers (0-10, 10-\n\n20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-50 cm) using auger to analyze for texture, \n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n 23 \n \n\nbulk density, infiltration rate, wilting point, field capacity, total N as well as available P and \n\nK. Moreover, different soil depth samples (0-15, 15-30, 30-45 cm) were collected to \n\ndetermine soil salinity. Samples were collected from within and between rows of \n\nP.oleracea plants and combined. \n\nThe samples were analyzed by the Central Laboratory of the Uzbek Research Institute of \n\nCotton Growing (UzRICG). \n\nIn order to measure the electrical conductivity (ECw) of groundwater, irrigation water and \n\ndrainage water, the water samples were taken from the experimental fields to the \n\nlaboratory. \n\n \n\nIII.5 \u2013 Tested Crops \n\nIn order to study the potential capacity to remove soil salts, Portulaca oleracea Golden \n\nPurslane and seven native naturally grown wild plants - Tamarix hispida, Apocynum \n\nlancifolium, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Portulaca oleracea (Green Purslane), Alhagi pseudalhagi, \n\nKarelinia caspia, Chenopodium album were evaluated as to their efficiency to remove ions \n\nfrom the salt-affected soils of Khorezm Region (Table III.1). \n\nTable III.1 - Investigated plants \n\nFamily Genus Species \n\nPortulacacea Portulaca Portulaca oleracea L. \n\nTamaricaceae Tamarix Tamarix hispida \u2013 Willd. \n\nApocynaceae Apocynum Apocynum lancifolium L. \n\nAsteraceae Karelinia Karelinia caspia (Pall.)

It is widely used as food consumption in daily life \n\nof human. Leaves and stems of this plant can be eaten raw or cooked. The young leaves are \n\na very acceptable addition to salads, their mucilaginous quality also making them a good \n\nsubstitute for okra as a thickener in soups (Grieve, 1984). Older leaves are used as a \n\npotherb. Furthermore, in many places of the world, particularly in Central Asia, chopped \n\nleaves of the Portulaca oleracea is used in the national food \u201csamsa\u201d.  \n\nAdditionally, it has medicinal importance, e.g. the leaves \n\nof Portulaca oleracea are a rich source of omega-3 fatty \n\nacids, which is thought to be important in preventing \n\nheart attacks and strengthening the immune system. A tea \n\nmade from the leaves is used in the treatment of stomach \n\naches and headaches. The leaves can be harvested at any \n\ntime before the plant flowers; they are used fresh or \n\ndried. However, this remedy is not given to pregnant \n\nwomen or to patients with digestive problems (Brown, 1995). \n\nMoreover, the selected Tamarix hispida \n\ncrop is characterized as an easily grown \n\nplant, succeeding in most soils and tolerant \n\nof saline conditions (Fig. III.9). It grows \n\nwell in heavy clay as well as sandy soils. It \n\nis also tolerant of maritime winds and dry \n\nsoils when grown near the coast, plants \n\nrequire a moister soil and shelter from cold drying winds when they are grown inland in \n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n 25 \n \n\nFig. III.10 - Apocynum Lancifolium \nSource: Japanese website\n\nFig. III.11 - Karelinia caspia in Study Area \n\nnon-saline soils because they use soil salt that are found in saline soils to help them reduce \n\ntranspiration (Bochansev et al., 1955). This plant is mainly used to stabilize the soil and \n\nalso to make a good shelter hedge in coastal gardens. The plant can be found in East and \n\nCentral Asia \u2013 Caspian Sea to Manchuria.  \n\nApocynum lancifolium is a wild halophytic species \n\nwidely distributed in the northern part of Uzbekistan \n\n(Fig. III.10). The stems of this plant are from 80 to \n\n200 cm tall, glabrous except for inflorescences; \n\nbraches and branchlets whitish gray, terete, finely \n\nstriate. This plant can be found in the salt-barren \n\nzones, desert margins, alluvial flats, riversides. \n\nThe strong bast fibers obtained from the inner bark \n\nare used in making cloth, strings, sails, fishing nests, and high-quality paper. The leaves \n\nyield up to 5% gum, which is used for making rubber, and a medicine used as a sedative \n\nand to treat hypertension. The species has fragrant flowers and is grown as a honey plant \n\n(Bondarenko et al., 1961). \n\nThe physical characteristics of the Karelinia \n\ncaspia is: stems from 50 to 100 cm length \n\n(Fig. III.11). The calathidiums are cylindrical, \n\nwidth 4-8 mm, length 10-15 mm. Flowers are \n\npink-lilac in color. Cypselas are wedge-\n\nshaped, slightly arcuated with vague blunt \n\nand puce color. Pappus is almost 10 times \n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n 26 \n \n\nFig. III.12 - Alhagi pseudalhagi \nSource: AIS/NWI \n\nlonger than cypsela (Bondarenko et al., 1962). It can be found in the salt marshes, coastline \n\nand riversides, usually occurs as weed in the abandoned lands, and also cultivated in saline \n\nlands. Furthermore, it can serve as animal grazing, particularly sheep, goat and cow feed. \n\nGlycyrrhiza glabra is one of the most widely used species of Glycyrrhiza. It is used \n\ntraditionally to relieve coughs and sore throats, and against gastric inflammation. One of \n\nthe main active ingredients is glycyrrhizin, which has a cortisone-like effect and, \n\nadditionally, is 50 times sweeter than sucrose (Borisova et al., 1955). Apart from its \n\nmedicinal applications, it is employed as a flavoring agent in sweets and tobacco, and as a \n\nfoaming agent in fire extinguishers and beer (WWF). The plant is 1.2-1.8m tall, leaves \n\npinnate with 9-17 leaflets and flowers pale blue, pea-like. It is widely distributed in Eurasia, \n\nincluding the Mediterranean region, China, India, Central Asia and western Siberia.  \n\nAlhagi pseudalhagi is a noxious weed13 in the US \n\nbut a medicinal plant in the Asia (Fig. III.12). This \n\ngreen shrub is to 1 - 2 m tall, with simple leaves, \n\nmany thorny branches, and an extensive root \n\nsystem. Plants spread rapidly by clonal vegetative \n\nreproduction from vigorous rhizomes. This desert \n\nplant introduced from the Mediterranean region and \n\nCentral Asia. The whole plant is diaphoretic, \n\ndiuretic, expectorant and laxative. Oil from the \n\nleaves is used in the treatment of rheumatism. The flowers are used in the treatment of piles \n\n(Bown, 1995). Extensive rhizomes present. Woody root system can grow more than 2 m \n\n                                                 \n13 It is a plant which is harmful to living things, injurious to health \n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n 27 \n \n\nFig. III.13 - Portulaca Oleracea: \nGreen Purslane in Study Area \n\ndeep and to a distance of 8 (12) m or more in all directions. Rhizomes at depths to 1.5 m \n\nproduce new shoots and deep vertical roots at about 1-1.5 m intervals. \n\nChenopodium album (Fat Hen; also called white goosefoot, lamb's quarters, or pigweed), is \n\na fast-growing, upright, weedy annual species of goosefoot, very common in temperate \n\nregions, growing almost everywhere in soils rich in nitrogen, especially on wasteland. Its \n\npollen can contribute to hayfever-like allergies. It tends to grow upright at first, reaching \n\nheights of 30-80 cm, but typically becomes recumbent after flowering (due to the weight of \n\nthe foliage and seeds) unless supported by other plants (Bochansev et al., 1953). Fat Hen \n\ncan be eaten as a vegetable, either steamed in entirety, or the leaves cooked like spinach as \n\na leaf vegetable. Each plant produces tens of thousands of black seeds. These are very \n\nnutritious, high in protein, vitamin A, calcium, phosphorus, and potassium. Quinoa is a \n\nclosely related species grown specifically for its seeds (www.wikipedia.org). As the \n\ncommon name suggests, it is also a very good feed (both the leaves and the seeds) for \n\nchickens (hens) and other poultry. Furthermore, according to the PFFD report, the plant can \n\nbe discovered around the world. \n\nNative naturally grown Portulaca oleracea green \n\npurslane was also assessed to its potential salt \n\nremoval capacity (Fig. III.13). The whole \n\ncharacteristics of this purslane are the same as of \n\ngolden purslane but it is more unpleasant. This green \n\npurslane is mainly used as poultry feed in Central \n\nAsia. \n\n \n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n 28 \n \n\nThe below table summarizes the use of all the investigated plants in the daily life (Table \n\nIII.2). \n\nTable III.2 \u2013 Benefits of investigated plants  \nSpecies Uses \n\nPortulaca oleracea L. \n\n\u2022 Leaves and stems can be eaten raw or cooked \n\u2022 Salad \n\u2022 Leaves as a potherb \n\u2022 \u201cSamsa\u201d \n\u2022 Prevents heart attacks \n\u2022 Strengthens the immune system \n\nTamarix hispida \u2013 Willd. \u2022 Stabilizes the soil \n\u2022 Makes a good shelter hedge \n\nApocynum lancifolium L. \n\u2022 Making cloth, strings, sails, fishing nets, high-quality \npapers \n\u2022 Sedative and treat hypertension \n\nKarelinia caspia (Pall.)

A weighed 20 gram of air-dried soil placed into porcelain flask. 12 mL of sodium \n\noxalate solution along with 8 mL of deionized water was added to the flask. The sample \n\nwas mixed and transferred into the 250 mL flask filled with deionized water to heat up. \n\nAfter cooling, the sample was transferred to the 1 L cylinder flask to quantify the soil \n\ntexture through titration. The flask was filled with deionized water and mixed carefully. \n\nThe cylinder flask was installed into the titration device and through pipettes the device \n\ntook the sample from the flask with 20-25 mL volume. \n\nIn total, the soil was differentiated into seven size classes with the following diameters:      \n\n> 0.25; 0.25-0.1; 0.1-0.05; 0.05-0.01; 0.01-0.005; 0.005-0.001;&lt;0.001 mm according to \n\nKachinsky\u00b4s method and converted to the American texture classification (Annex 3). The \n\nfirst two fractions were determined through washing the sieves whereas the last four \n\nthrough pipettes. The fraction weight of 0.1-0.05 mm calculated with the difference \n\nbetween initial soil sample weight (20 g) and sum of six fractions. The calculations of soil \n\nfraction weights B (%) was performed using following equation: \n\n \n\n \n\nwhere: P \u2013 weight of appropriate fraction (g) \n\n 20 \u2013 amount of soil samples (g) \n\n 25 \u2013 volume of pipette (mL) \n\n 1000 \u2013 volume of cylinder (mL) \n\nMoreover, the following equation was applied to calculate first two fractions (> 0.25; 0.25-\n\n0.1), washed in sieves: \n\n25*20\n1000*100*P\n\nB = (III.2)\n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n 30 \n \n\nFig. III.14 - Determination of Soil Bulk \nDensity using a Core Sampler and a Shovel \n\n \n \n \n \n\nwhere: B \u2013 content of fraction (%) \n\n P \u2013 weight of fraction (g) \n\n 20 \u2013 amount of soil samples (g) \n\nIn addition, the fraction 0.1-0.05 mm was quantified by the difference between soil sample \n\nweight and sum of obtained fraction. \n\n \n\nIII.6.1.2 \u2013 Soil Water Content \n\nThe soil moisture at the nonsaline wilting point (WP) and at the field capacity (FC) was \n\ndetermined for field 1 and field 2 by gravimetric method (Annex 3) and was calculated at \n\nthe field (Beltrao, 1996; Ben Asher, 2002). The samples were analyzed by gravimetric \n\nmethod and later on, converted into a volumetric basis by considering the bulk density of \n\nthe respective soil layers (determined in the soil pits).  \n\n \n \nIII.6.1.3 - Bulk Density \n\nThe soil bulk density (BD) was determined \n\nusing core sampler to inquire the soil \n\ncompactness (Blake &amp; Hartge, 1986). The soil \n\nsamples were collected from 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 \n\ncm depths using shovel and core sampler (Fig. \n\nIII.14).

Field 3 was \n\nanalyzed for soil texture and thus, was not measured for infiltration rate in this study. It is \n\nknown that infiltration rate is directly correlated with texture and can be predicted by \n\nlooking at the soil texture results. \n\nInfiltration rate was measured by the depth (in \n\nmm) of the water layer that can enter the soil in \n\none hour. A cylinder with the diameter of 22.5 \n\ncm was hammered into the soil in the \n\nexperimental fields. The timber was used to \n\nprotect the ring from the damage during \n\nhammering. The cylinder was kept vertically, \n\n(III.4)\nVA\n\nC\nBD\n\n*)100(\n100)W(\n\n+\n??\n\n=\n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n 32 \n \n\nso approximately 15 cm was left above the ground. Additionally, 55 cm cylinder was \n\nconstructed an earth bund around the 22.5 cm cylinder to the same height as the cylinder \n\nand placed the hessian inside the infiltrometer to protect the soil surface when pouring the \n\nwater (Fig. III.15). \n\nAfterwards, the water was poured into the cylinder and to the space between the two \n\ncylinders. The time was recorded to know the infiltration rate. After 4-5 minutes, the drop \n\nin water level in the inner cylinder was recorded and water added to bring the level back to \n\napproximately the original level at the start of the test. The test was continued about 6 hours \n\nwhile keeping the water level the same over the same time interval, but as the time goes on \n\nthe interval between readings was extended (e.g. 20-30 minutes). Meantime, infiltration \n\nvolume was recorded each time of water adding. The final infiltration rate (f), expressed as \n\nmm h-1, was calculated as following:    \n\n60*\n)*(\n\n)10*(\nf\n\ntS\nQ\n\n=  \n\nwhere:  Q \u2013 cylinder water volume (cm3) \n\n  t -  time differences (min.) \n\n S \u2013 inner cylinder area (cm2), determined through             equation \n\n  d \u2013 inner cylinder diameter = 22.5 cm   \n\n \n\n \n\nIII.6.1.5 - Total Nitrogen \n\nThe Kjeldahl method was used to determine total nitrogen (N) in the soil (McGill &amp; \n\nFigueiredo, 1993). The soil samples were air-dried, ground and sieved before analysis.  \n\nThis method is divided into three phases: \n\n4\n* 2d\n\nS\n?\n\n=\n\n(III.5)\n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n 33 \n \n\n- Digestion \u2013 1 gram of sieved soil placed in a dry digestion tube. 5 mL of deionized H2O \n\nwas added and swirled to wet all the soil. Then, 25 mL of concentrated H2SO4 was added \n\nand placed into the digestion block in 450\no\nC for 4 hours. \n\n- Distillation \u2013 the digested samples were transferred to a distillation flask, which was \n\nconnected to the steam distillation apparatus. Samples were neutralized with sodium \n\nhydroxide. In order to receive and keep the N distilled, 10 mL of 4% (weight/volume) boric \n\nacid was added to the flask. \n\n- Titration \u2013 the distillate was titrated with 0.01 M sulphuric acid. The color changed at the \n\nend point from green to pink. The following equation was used to compute total N (%) in \n\nthe soil: \n\n \n\nwhere: V \u2013 volume of H2SO4 spent in the titration (mL) \n\n f \u2013  H2SO4 concentration (M) \n\n m \u2013 mass of the sample (g) \n\n 0.28 \u2013 1 mL of 0.01 M H2SO4 is equivalent to 0.28 mg of N \n\n \n\n \n\nIII.6.1.6 - Potassium and Phosphorus \n\nMachigin method was used to determine available potassium and phosphorus in the soil of \n\nexperimental area (Radov et al., 1971). Five grams of sieved soil were placed into a 250 \n\nmL conical retort and filled up with 100 mL of 1% (w/v) ammonium carbonate solution. \n\nThe suspension was shaken for about 5 minutes and stored for 24 hours. During this time it \n\nwas shaken every 6 hours. Afterwards, the suspension was filtered and the filtrate was \n\nanalyzed for potassium (K+) by flame-photometry.  \n\n100*\nm\n\n28.0** fV\nN = (III.6)\n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n 34 \n \n\nFig. III.16 - Soil Extraction \n\n In order to analyze phosphorus, the filtrate was decolorized by adding dilute sulphuric acid \n\nand 0.5 M potassium permanganate solutions. The mixture was then boiled for 2 minutes. \n\nAfter adding 1 mL of 10 % (w/v) glucose, the solution was cooled and neutralized with 10 \n\n% (w/v) Na2CO3 solution in the presence of an indicator. In addition, to the 50 mL of \n\ncolorless mixture, 2 mL of molybdenum reagent solution and 0.5 mL stannous chloride \n\nwere added. After 5 minutes, the phosphorus was analyzed colorimetically.  \n\n \n\n \n\nIII.6.1.7 - Salinity \n\nThe analysis for determining soil salinity was \n\nconducted according to Machigin\u2019s (1963) method \n\nusing an aqueous extract of the soil (ratio 1:5, i.e. \n\n30 gram of air-dry soil and 150 mL of distilled \n\nwater). The sample solution was 4 times shaken for \n\n1 minute at a 30 minute interval and allowed to stay \n\n24 hours in order the soil to settle (Fig. III.16). Afterwards, the solution was filtered and \n\nprepared to quantify for total dissolved solids (TDS) and salt ion compositions (Cl\n-\n, Na+, \n\nK+, Ca2+, Mg2+) at the UzRICG laboratory (Annex 4). \n\nThis USSR classification of soil salinity, used in Central Asia, based on laboratory \n\nmeasurements of the TDS (%), was converted according to FAO classification, in electrical \n\nconductivity of saturated soil extract (ECe). The standard unit for ECe is deciSiemens per \n\nmeter (dS m-1). \n\n \n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n 35 \n \n\nFig. III.17 - Quantification of Ions in \nthe Soil using Titration Method \n\nIII.6.1.7.1 - Chloride \n\nPotassium chromate was used as an indicator in the \n\ndetermination of chlorides in the soil by titration \n\nwith standard AgNO3 solution (Machigin, 1963). \n\nThis method is called the Mohr method of \n\ndetermining Cl\n-\n and is based on the formation of a \n\nred precipitate of silver chromate (Ag2CrO4) at the \n\nend point, after all the Cl\n-\n has been precipitated as \n\nwhite AgCl. To 10 mL of the sample solution, 2-3 \n\ndrops of 10% (w/v) K2CrO4 solution was added \n\nand titrated with 0.01 N of AgNO3 until the appearance of a reddish color (Fig. III.17). The \n\nfollowing equation was used to quantify Cl\n-\n content (X), expressed in percentage, in the air-\n\ndried soil: \n\n \n\nwhere: a \u2013 volume of 0.01 N AgNO3, spent for titration (mL) \n\n0.00035 \u2013 this amount of gram Cl\n-\n corresponds 1 mL 0.01N AgNO3  \n\nE \u2013 volume of water sample (mL) \n\nM \u2013 volume of sample solution (mL) \n\nW \u2013 amount of soil sample (g) \n\n \n\nIII.6.1.7.2 - Sodium and Potassium \n\nThe analyses of Na+ and K+ in the soil were performed using flame photometry method \n\n(Samokhvalov et al., 1999).

For sodium, NaCl 0.005 N was used and 0.2923 g of dried NaCl was dissolved in \n\none liter of extracting solution. For potassium, KCl 0.005 N was used and 0.3728 g of dried \n\nKCl was dissolved in one liter of extracting solution. In the case of high concentrations of \n\nK+ and Na+, appropriate dilutions with extracting solution were performed. Obtained results \n\nwere converted into percentage using Annex 5 and 6. \n\n \n\nIII.6.1.7.3 - Calcium and Magnesium \n\nThe Calcium (Ca2+) and Magnesium (Mg2+) concentrations in the in the examined soil \n\nprofiles of the experimental fields were determined by titration method (Machigin &amp; \n\nProtasov, 1963). To determine the sum of Ca2+ and Mg2+, 10 mL of the sample solution \n\nwas taken and diluted with distilled water. After addition of 5 mL of ammonium chloride \n\nand 2-3 drops of darkish chromogen, the mixture was titrated with 0.05 N Trilon B solution \n\nuntil the appearance of a blue color. \n\nTo quantify Ca2+ separately, 10 mL of the sample solution was taken and diluted with \n\ndistilled water. After the addition of 2 mL of potassium hydroxide, the mixture was titrated \n\nwith 0.05 N Trilon B solutions until the appearance of a violet color. \n\nMg2+ was quantified by subtraction of the result of Ca2+ from the result of Ca2+ + Mg2+. \n\nThe following equation was used to perform calculation: \n\n \n\n \n\nIn order to convert into percentage based, the molecular weight (n) of ions was used:  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1000\n*./ neqvmg\n\nW*M\n100*E*05.0\n\n.)/(\nN\n\neqvmgMgCa =+ (III.8)\n\n(III.9)\n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n 37 \n \n\nIII.6.1.7.4 - Total Dissolved Solids \n\nGravimetric method was used to measure total dissolved solids (often abbreviated TDS), \n\nwhich is the most accurate and involve evaporating the liquid solvent to leave a residue \n\n(Position Paper, 2003). In order to measure TDS, 20 mL of sample solution was placed into \n\na 100 mL beaker and allowed the liquid to evaporate in the oven at 105\no\nC for 3 hours. \n\nWhen the beaker was dry, it was cooled in a dessicator and reweighed. The following \n\nformula was used to calculate TDS, expressed in percentage (Annex 4 a): \n\n \n\n \n\nwhere: a \u2013 mass of beaker after water evaporated (g) \n\nb \u2013 tare weight of beaker (g) \n\nE \u2013 volume of water sample (mL) \n\nM \u2013 volume of sample solution (mL) \n\nW \u2013 amount of soil sample (g) \n\n \n\n \n\nIII.6.2 - Chemical Analytical Methods for Plants \n\nPlant materials were extracted to measure chloride, sodium, potassium, calcium and \n\nmagnesium concentrations in a Laboratory of the University of Algarve (UALG). Chloride \n\nwas extracted using cold water at room temperature (23-25\no\nC), according to the procedure \n\nproposed by Drew and Saker (1984), whereas the cations were extracted by a dry-ash \n\nmethod at 5500C incinerator using a Thermolyne, Type 1500 Furnace (Yeo &amp; Gullasch, \n\n1977). \n\nW*M\n100*E*)ba(\n\nTDS\n?\n\n= (III.10)\n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n 38 \n \n\nFig. III.19 - Determination of Cl\n-\n in DM \n\nusing Potentiometric Method \n\nFig. III.18 - Extraction of Plant Samples \n\nIn the case of chloride, a 100 mg of ground shoot material was stirred in a glass vial with \n\n50 mL of deionized water at room temperature (23-25\no\nC) using three replicates. The \n\nsupernatant was filtered and stored in a volumetric flask (Fig. III.18). \n\n1 gram of ground shoot material was \n\nweighed, placed into a glass liquid \n\nscintillation vial and ashed in a muffle \n\nfurnace for 6 h at 5500C to measure \n\ncations. After cooling, the ash was \n\ndissolved with 10 mL of 0.1 N HCl \n\nsolutions in a heater. The samples were \n\nfiltered and filled up with deionized water until 100 mL in a volumetric flask. \n\n \n\n \n\nIII.6.2.1 \u2013 Chloride \n\nThe potentiometric method, pH/mV meter, \n\nwas used with double Junction Reference \n\nElectrode and Chloride Ion Electrode to \n\nmeasure Cl\n- \n\nconcentrations in the dry matter \n\n(Fig. III.19). By serial dilution of the 1000 \n\nppm standards, 100 and 10 ppm chloride \n\nstandards were prepared. 2 mL of a Ionic \n\nStrength Adjuster (ISA) was added per 100 mL of standard. Using the semi-logarithmic \n\ngraph paper, the mV reading (linear axis) was plotted against the concentration (log axis). \n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n 39 \n \n\nThe curve was extrapolated down to about 1 ppm to build up a calibration curve. \n\nAfterwards, to the dry 100 mL beaker, 50 mL of sample and 1 mL of ISA was added. The \n\nbaker was placed into the magnetic stirrer. The electrode tips were placed into the solution \n\nand when the reading was stabilized, the mV reading was recorded. The concentration of \n\nchlorides in the dry shoot material was determined directly from the calibration curve with \n\nthe unit of parts per million (ppm). Later, the ppm (equal to mg L-1) unit was converted to \n\nmg g-1 unit using the following equation:  \n\nL = Fc * Se \n\nwhere: L \u2013 chloride concentration, expressed as mg g-1 \n\n Fc \u2013 chloride concentration given by the machine, expressed as mg L-1 \n\n Se  \u2013 extraction solution, expressed as L g-1;   S = \ng1.0\nL05.0\n\n \n\n \n \n \nIII.6.2.2 - Sodium and Potassium \n\nFlame photometry (FP) method was used to measure Na+ and K+ in the dry shoot material. \n\nIn order to calibrate FP, a series of standard solutions were prepared containing exact and \n\nincreasing amounts of a cation over a selected range. Moreover, standard concentrations \n\nwere prepared using sodium or potassium standard solutions, i.e. to the 10 mL of sodium or \n\npotassium standard solution (1000 ppm) added 90 mL of deionized water to make 100 ppm \n\nsolution. Afterwards, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 mL of the 100 ppm solutions of K+ and Na+ were taken \n\nseparately into 100 mL volumetric flask, filled with deionized water and read for \n\ncalibration curve (Annex 7). After the calibration curve, the samples were placed into the \n\nmachine. The necessary dilutions of the samples were prepared according to the results \n\ngiven by the FP machine.

Several standard solutions were \n\nprepared using a 1000 ppm calcium or \n\nmagnesium standard solution. To prepare the \n\nstandards, 5 mL of strontium chloride (SrCl2) \n\nand 1 mL of 3 N HCl were added to each sample. The calibration curve was obtained using \n\nstandard solutions (Annex 7). Moreover, to the 2 mL of extracted sample 50 mL of \n\ndeionized water was added along with 5 mL SrCl2 and 1 mL of 3 N HCl. Appropriate \n\ndilutions were made in case of high concentrations of the analyzing ions. \n\n \n\n \n\nIII.6.3 - Chemical Analytical Method for Water \n\nIII.6.3.1 \u2013 Water Mineralization \n\nThe groundwater table was examined to assess irrigation performance and contribution to \n\ncrop soil-water requirement.

The method \n\nof extraction and quantification was the same \n\nas used in soil salinity. At the end of the \n\nexperiment, the results were obtained in g L-1. \n\nIn the case of TDS, 50 mL of water was \n\nplaced into the oven at 105\no\nC for 3 hours to evaporate the water. The residue weight left \n\nafter water has evaporated was recorded and the value was multiplied into initial water \n\nsample to obtain g L-1 unit. \n\nLater, this USSR classification to determine water mineralization based on laboratory \n\nmeasurements was converted, according to FAO classification, in electrical conductivity of \n\nwater (ECw) and recorded as dS m-1. \n\n \n \nIII.7 - Statistical analysis \n\nThe data were subjected to standard analyses of variance using the One-Way ANOVA \n\nprocedure of the SPSS 14.0 for Windows (SPSS, 2005) to compare mean values of Cl\n-\n \n\nconcentrations, obtained through potentiometric method, with two different harvested \n\nmonths.

The full derivation of this regression modeling \n\ntechnique is described in the Annex 15 (a &amp; b). \n\n\n\nResults and Discussions \n\n 43 \n \n\nIV - Results and Discussions \n\nIV.1 - Soil Characteristics in the Experimental Area \n\nThe experimental area covered three fields in the region. As it was mentioned in the \n\nprevious section, the following general investigations were carried out in each field to \n\ndetermine the soil characteristics: soil profile, bulk density, infiltration rate and soil water \n\ncontent. Furthermore, agrochemical properties and soil salinity were also assessed. The \n\nfindings are described below. \n\n \n\nIV.1.1 \u2013 Texture \n\nThe soil profile investigation showed that the soils in the study areas are partially stratified. \n\nAccording to Kachinsky\u00b4s classification (Handbook on Soil Science, 1980) the topsoil layer \n\n(0-20 cm) and middle layers (30-40 cm) of field 1 was medium loamy (Fig. IV.1, Annex 2). \n\nIn field 2, the topsoil layer (0-30 cm) was heavy loamy whereas the subsoil layers (30-50 \n\ncm) contained more silt and sand, thus were classified as medium loamy. Meanwhile, field \n\n3 had a lighter texture (loamy light topsoil followed by loamy sandy subsoil). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n [cm] \n\n0 \n\n50 \n\n40 \n\n30 \n\n20 \n\nField 3 Field 2 Field 1 \n\n10 \n\n \nMedium \n\nloam  \n \n \n\n Heavy \nloam \n\nMedium \nloam \n\nHeavy \nloam \n\n \n \n \n\nHeavy \nloam  \n\n \n \n \n\nMedium \nloam \n\nLight \nloam  \n\n \n \n \n \n\nSandy \nloam \n\n \n\nFig. IV.1 - Soil Texture in the Experimental Fields \n\n\n\nResults and Discussions \n\n 44 \n \n\nIn addition, based on FAO (1998) classification and the results obtained, the soil of field 1 \n\ncan be classified as Fluvisols with histic horizon having fluvic soil material starting within \n\n25 cm from the soil surface and continuing to a depth of at least 50 cm from the soil \n\nsurface. It should be noted that due to influence from the river, the soils always in change \n\nand thus, named as alluvial soils. \n\nDue to a heavy textured surface horizon, field 2 classified as Fluvisols with takyric horizon, \n\nwhich mainly occurs under semi-arid conditions. On the other hand, because of sandy and \n\nhighly saline soils, field 3 was classified as Solonchak with calcic horizon having high \n\ncalcium and salt content in the surface horizons. \n\n \n\nIV.1.2 - Bulk Density \n\nThe soil bulk density data is shown in Annex 2. As can be seen in this table, the soil bulk \n\ndensity of field 2 ranged from 1.41-1.44 g cm-3 and averaged 1.43 g cm-3 over the examined \n\nprofiles. For instance, in the topsoil layer from 0-10 cm, the density was 1.41 g cm-3, \n\nwhereas the deeper subsoil layer from 10-30 cm, an increased of density 1.43 g cm-3 was \n\nobserved. In the subsoil layer from 30-50 cm, the density was 1.44 g cm-3. Based on these \n\nresults, this field can be characterized as a heavy loamy soil, with slow water movement \n\nbetween soil particles, high bulk density, soil water holding capacity is low and irrigation \n\nperiods are long. \n\nOn the other hand, with a fluvisols histic horizon soil structure, field 1 had lower bulk \n\ndensity than field 2. In the first 0-10 cm of soil depth, the bulk density was 1.35 g cm-3 and \n\nin the deeper soil layer, a higher bulk density was observed. Likewise, at 10-20 and 20-30 \n\ncm soil depth, the bulk density was 1.36 and 1.37 g cm-3, respectively. In the 30-50 cm \n\nsubsoil layer, the bulk density was observed as 1.39 g cm-3. An average, the bulk density of \n\n\n\nResults and Discussions \n\n 45 \n \n\nthe 0-50 cm soil layer was 1.37 g cm-3. This data shows that the soil is middle loamy, the \n\nsoil water holding capacity is high, water fills the soil particles rapidly and infiltrates to the \n\nimpermeable layer, and irrigation is required frequently. \n\nFurthermore, field 3 had sandy soils, thus, higher bulk density was observed. For instance, \n\nfor the 0-50 cm soil depths, the soil bulk density averaged 1.60 g cm-3. As can be seen in \n\nAnnex 2, the bulk density under the investigated fields was lower in the topsoil layers and \n\nincreased with the depth of profiles. Generally, bulk density is related to soil texture and \n\neluvia processes in the soil. It can be presumed, from the experimental results, that the \n\nvolumetric weight of soil in field 1 could be appropriate and satisfactory to the growth and \n\ndevelopment of Portulaca oleracea as well as other potential salt-removing plants. \n\n \n\nIV.1.3 \u2013 Infiltration Rate \n\nPrevious investigations showed that bulk density is related to water infiltration (Revut, \n\n1962; Voronin, 1996). The compaction of the soil leads to a decrease in the infiltration rate \n\n(Cheshev et al., 1978). The investigated soils were characterized by different percolation \n\nrates. The water infiltration was significantly higher during the two hours of experimental \n\nperiod in field 1 compared to field 2. The infiltration rate in field 1 ranged between 13.6-\n\n173.5 mm h-1 and averaged 45.3 mm h-1 during an experimental period of six hours, which \n\nillustrates that a water layer of 45.3 mm on the soil surface, will take one hour to infiltrate \n\n(Fig. VI.2). During the early stages of infiltration, the highest infiltration rate was observed \n\ndue to dry soil. As time went on, the water from the soil surface infiltrated more slowly \n\nbecause the air in the pores was replaced by water and eventually reached a steady rate.  \n\nIn principal, infiltration rate depends on soil texture and soil structure, and is the best way \n\nof categorizing soils from an irrigation point of view. In the field 1, obtained results showed \n\n\n\nResults and Discussions \n\n 46 \n \n\nthat with the medium loamy soil, irrigation water should be applied frequently since water \n\nis soaked/absorbed by the soil rapidly. \n\nOn the other hand, infiltration rates in field 2 were observed to be relatively low compared \n\nto field 1, ranging between 2.0-52.5 mm h-1 and averaging 11.4 mm h-1 during the study six \n\nhours period. Therefore, it can be stated that the soil was at a saturation point where the \n\nmacropores and micropores are full of water. More details on infiltration rates for the two \n\nexperimental sites are reported in Annex 8. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nIV.1.4 \u2013 Soil Water Content \n\nIn the field 1, the volumetric soil water content at nonsaline wilting point ranged between \n\n0.210-0.281 m3 m-3 and averaged 0.259 m3 m-3 over the examined soil profiles (Annex 3). \n\nThis means that below this point the availability of soil water to the plant roots is limited. \n\nThis is known as called hydroscopic water condition. It is interesting to note that topsoil \n\nlayers had lower values compared to deeper layers, which illustrates that upper layers have \n\ndrier soil and plants withdrew water rapidly. Meanwhile, volumetric soil water content at \n\nfield capacity (FC) varied from 0.281 to 0.304 m3 m-3 and averaged 0.290 m3 m-3 in field 1. \n\nFig. IV.2 - Soil Infiltration Rate Determined at two Locations  \nof Experimental Site \n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nObservation period (hours)\n\nIn\nfi\n\nlt\nra\n\nti\non\n\n (m\nm\n\n)\n\nField #1 Field #2\n\n\n\nResults and Discussions \n\n 47 \n \n\nIt should be pointed out that topsoil layers showed higher values of field capacity (FC) than \n\nsubsoil layers requiring higher irrigation amounts in upper layers. \n\nMoreover, field 2 results showed that the volumetric soil water content values at wilting \n\npoint is closer to volumetric soil water content at field capacity, which illustrates the soil \n\ncontains excess water. For instance, volumetric soil water content at wilting point ranged \n\nbetween 0.283-0.313 m3 m-3 and averaged 0.292 m3 m-3, while FC ranged between 0.298-\n\n0.319 m3 m-3, averaging 0.305 m3 m-3, which can be interpreted as the maximum amount of \n\nwater the soil can hold. Monitoring soil water content is essential in this field to optimize \n\ncrop production, conserve water, reduce environmental impacts and save money. \n\nIn addition, soil water content data in the fields investigated helps to improve irrigation \n\ndecisions such as how much water to apply and when to apply it, to match water applied \n\nirrigation with crop water requirements and thus avoiding over-irrigating the crop. \n\n \n\nIV.1.5 \u2013 Agrochemical Properties \n\nIt is known that the growth and development of crops depend on the availability of \n\nnitrogen, phosphorus, humus and other elements in the soil. The total nitrogen (N) in the \n\nsoil, available phosphorus (expressed as P2O5) and humus content in the investigated fields \n\nare summarized in Fig. IV.3. As can be seen in Fig. IV.3, the content of total N, available \n\nP2O5 and humus in the field 1 soils were higher than in other fields. Furthermore, upper \n\nlayers of soils had higher content of nutrients in all experimental fields.  \n\nIt can be noticed that the highest amount of potassium (140 mg K2O kg-1) was found in the \n\ntopsoil layers of field 1 and the lowest (40 mg kg-1) in the subsoil layers of field 2 and 3 \n\n(Annex 9). Likewise, upper layers showed higher concentrations of K2O than subsoil \n\nlayers. \n\n\n\nResults and Discussions \n\n 48 \n \n\nIn general, the clay soils contain more nutrients whereas sandy soils are poor in organic \n\nmatter, nitrogen and mineral nutrients. Meanwhile, loam soils have an intermediate position \n\nregarding soil properties and are usually more fertile than sandy soils. Since the soils of \n\ninvestigated fields have a silt-sand texture, they are poor in nutrients thus heavy application \n\nof fertilizers is essential in order to increase crop productivity. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nIV.1.6 - Salinity \n\nThe soil solution in the experimental fields had higher salt concentrations than irrigation \n\nwater. The electrical conductivity of soil ECe (expressed as dS m-1) examined during the \n\nexperimental period mostly corresponded to the degree of salinity ranging between slight \n\nand moderate (FAO classification, 1985). However, values above 8 dS m-1 have been \n\nobserved. Such deviations towards a strong degree in soil salinity were more prominent in \n\nthe fields with naturally grown plant fields (Fig. IV.4). \n\n5\n\n15\n\n25\n\n35\n\n45\n\n55\n\n0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1\n\nTotal N (%)\n\nS\noi\n\nl d\nep\n\nth\n (c\n\nm\n)\n\nField 1 Field 2 Field 3\n\n5\n\n15\n\n25\n\n35\n\n45\n\n55\n\n0 0.04 0.08 0.12 0.16\n\nPhosphorous (%)\n\nS\noi\n\nl d\nep\n\nth\n (c\n\nm\n)\n\nField 1 Field 2 Field 3\n\n5\n\n15\n\n25\n\n35\n\n45\n\n55\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n\nHumus (%)\n\nS\noi\n\nl d\nep\n\nth\n (c\n\nm\n)\n\nField 1 Field 2 Field 3\n\nFig. IV.3 - Content of Total Nitrogen (%), Available Phosphorus (%) and  \nHumus in 50 cm Soil Depth \n\n\n\nResults and Discussions \n\n 49 \n \n\nFor instance, the degree of salinity in field 1, averaged over the 0-45 cm soil profile could \n\nbe classified as low saline with an average electrical conductivity of 1.20 dS m-1. It should \n\nbe pointed out that, before plantation, the field 1 was properly leached from the salinity and \n\nused as a pasture for animal feed. Thus, the soil salinity in this field was lower compared to \n\nother investigated fields. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFurthermore, adequate soil moisture conditions during the growing season of P.oleracea \n\nand input of highly saline groundwater to the plant roots, field 2 classified as slight to \n\nmoderate degree of soil salinity ranging between 1.48-5.50 dS m-1. In all cases, the upper \n\nlayers had higher salt concentrations than subsoil layers (Annex 4). \n\nFig. IV.4 - Electrical Conductivity of Soil Saturated Extract [dS m-1] from the \nMonitored Fields (average values for fields 1 and 2) \n\nField 1, P.oleracea,  ECe [dS m-1]\n0 3 6 9 12\n\n15\n\n30\n\n45S\noi\n\nl d\nep\n\nth\n [c\n\nm\n]\n\nField 2, P.oleracea, ECe [dS m-1]\n0 3 6 9 12\n\n15\n\n30\n\n45S\noi\n\nl d\nep\n\nth\n [c\n\nm\n]\n\nField 3, Chenopodium album,  ECe [dS m-1]\n0 3 6 9 12\n\n15\n\n30\n\n45\n\nS\noi\n\nl d\nep\n\nth\n [c\n\nm\n]\n\nField 3, Tamarix hispida,  ECe [dS m-1]\n0 4 8 12 16\n\n15\n\n30\n\n45\n\nSo\nil\n\n d\nep\n\nth\n [c\n\nm\n]\n\n\n\nResults and Discussions \n\n 50 \n \n\nIn field 3, the highest degree of soil salinity in a 0-15 cm soil layer was 14.4 dS m-1 (highly \n\nsaline) in the T.hispida field whereas the lowest degree of 9.78 dS m-1 was observed in the \n\nG.glabra field at the same soil profile. It should be stated that due to accessibility and \n\nadequate quality of the groundwater resources in this field, the plant species exposed to soil \n\nECe levels over 8 dS m-1 did not show any visual symptoms of salt stress. Elsewhere, \n\nBochansev et al. (1955) highlighted that T.hispida, C.album and K.caspia have highest \n\nadaptation to grow in saline environments and can be considered as halophyte species. \n\nAs it is known, high sodium concentration in the soil adversely affects to the development \n\nof plant roots. Moreover, high sodium can cause soil structure deterioration and water \n\ninfiltration problems. Thus, sodium levels in soil were analyzed in our study to identify the \n\nspecific soil problems and its severity using Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR) equation \n\n(Richards, 1954). Here, sodium (Na+), calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ion \n\nconcentrations are given in milliequivalent per liter (meq L-1): \n\n \n\n \n\n \nAccording to the results, SAR values for field 1 and field 2 averaged 1.1 and 3.35, \n\nrespectively, within 45 cm soil surface (Annex 10). Meanwhile, high SAR values observed \n\nin the naturally grown fields. For instance, the highest 6.83 SAR was observed in \n\nApocynum lancifolium soils, within 0-45 cm soil subsurface layers. Davis et al.  (2006) \n\nhighlighted that if the SAR value is above 13, sodium can cause problems for plants and \n\nsoils. In our experimental sites, the SAR values were below 13 and no significant sodium \n\neffect was observed. \n\n2\n\n22 ++\n\n+\n\n+\n=\n\nMgCa\nNa\n\nSAR (IV.1)\n\n\n\nResults and Discussions \n\n 51 \n \n\nMoreover, Richards (1954) proposed soil exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) using \n\nSAR to classify soils. The following equation was used to calculate ESP (%): \n\n \n\n \n \nThe results showed that field 1 had lower ESP values than field 2 (Annex 10). However, as \n\nwas the case in SAR, field 3 plants had the highest ESP. Average highest ESP 7.6 was \n\nobserved in G.glabra field over the examined 45 cm soil profile. It should be stated that \n\naccording to Richards (1954) soil classification, none of the investigated fields had \n\nsignificant sodic problems. \n\n \n\nIV.1.7 \u2013 Depth and Mineralization of Groundwater \n\nAccording to the results, the high groundwater table was observed in field 2 ranging \n\nbetween 56-61.5 cm within the soil pits (Annex 14), probably due to either inefficient \n\ndrainage or drainage that is artificially blocked by farmers in order to raise either drainage \n\nwater or the groundwater table to meet the crop water requirement. The farmers within the \n\narea of field 2 highlighted that the area sometimes faced irrigation water shortages and thus, \n\ngroundwater resources is used as a source of moisture for crops. It should be pointed out \n\nthat application of irrigation water could also have influenced to the increase of GWT in \n\nfield 2. On the other hand, in spite of leaching activities in field 1 before the experiment, \n\nthe groundwater table was far from the soil surface ranging between 108 and 115 cm within \n\nthe soil pits. \n\nMeantime, the mean electrical conductivity of the groundwater was 11.2 dS m-1 for field 2 \n\nand 6.2 dS m-1 for field 1. According to Rhoades et al. (1992), the groundwater of field 1 \n\n( )[ ]\n( )[ ]SAR\n\nSAR\nESP\n\n*01475.00126.01\n*01475.00126.0*100\n\n+?+\n+?\n\n= (IV.2)\n\n\n\nResults and Discussions \n\n 52 \n \n\ncould be classified as moderate while field 2 as highly saline. The main reasons for high \n\ngroundwater ECw in field 2 could have been: higher soil osmotic potential than matric \n\npressure and improper drainage systems causing a rise in GWT. \n\n \n\nIV.2 - Experiments with Portulaca Oleracea Golden Purslane \n\nIV.2.1 \u2013 Crop Yield and Vegetative Growth \n\nDespite the fact that the field 2 was irrigated during the vegetation period, the biomass of \n\nP.oleracea at the harvest time was very low averaging from 411 to 489 kg ha-1 dry matter \n\nin August and September, respectively (Annexes 11a &amp; 11b). It can be presumed that other \n\nfactors significantly influenced the decrease of production of biomass at field 2. These \n\ncould have been: higher degree of soil salinity, higher rate of upward water movement from \n\na shallow water table and no plucking the weeds after the irrigation. Interestingly, with no \n\nirrigation of field 1, high biomass production of P.oleracea averaging from 3507 to 3948 \n\nkg ha-1 DM was obtained. These results are confirmed by previous research implemented \n\nby the UzRICG (Kurambaev, 1969), which found that without irrigation the high crop (e.g. \n\ncotton) production can be obtained when the groundwater table (GWT) is at 1-1.2 m depth \n\nand only slightly saline. Moreover, before the experiment, field 1 was used as a pasture for \n\ncattle and sheep and the input of manure from these animals might have positively \n\ninfluenced to the higher production. On the other hand, field 2 was used to produce maize \n\nand fertilization was not done effectively. In addition, field 2 GWT was shallow, which \n\ncaused anaerobic conditions and hampered the development of the P.oleracea root system. \n\nThese aspects have already been studied in several crops, where the development was \n\n\n\nResults and Discussions \n\n 53 \n \n\nFig. IV.5 - Measurement of P.oleracea \nHeight on the Monitored Fields \n\nadversely affected with a significant decrease in production due to shallow GWT (Torres &amp; \n\nHanks, 1989; Beltrao et al., 1996). \n\nIn addition, a mean length of P.oleracea was \n\nmeasured in field 1 and 2 at harvest during \n\nthe experiment to identify the vegetative \n\ngrowth (Fig. IV.5 &amp; IV.6). At field 1, a \n\nmean length of P.oleracea averaged \n\nbetween 12.7\u201319.7 cm at harvest in August \n\nand September, respectively, whereas at \n\nfield 2 it varied from 14.5 to 17.8 cm at the \n\nharvest time.  \n\nMoreover, the roots of the plant varied from 5-10 cm in both experimental fields. It should \n\nbe pointed out that the higher degree of soil salinity in field 2 did not greatly affect to the \n\nplant height. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. IV.6 - A Mean Length [cm] of P.oleracea Golden Purslane in Three \nDifferent Plots of the two Experimental Fields at Harvest \n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n1 1 1 2 2 2\n\nExperimental P.oleracea fields\n\nA\n m\n\nea\nn\n\n le\nn\n\ngt\nh\n\n, c\nm\n\nAugust September\n\n\n\nResults and Discussions \n\n 54 \n \n\nIV.2.2 \u2013 Salt Accumulation \n\nThe analysis revealed that P.oleracea tissues accumulated the largest amounts of chloride \n\nand magnesium in field 1 (Annex 12). Moreover, sodium and calcium concentrations were \n\nalso relatively high in this field. The highest chloride ion concentration was accumulated by \n\nP.oleracea in field 1 and ranged between 64.16-75.63 mg g-1 DM, and averaged 71.10 mg \n\ng-1 DM in August harvest (Table IV.1). Furthermore, it was observed that the uptake of \n\nchloride (Cl\n-\n) by examined species in the September harvest was lower, and ranged \n\nbetween 64.70-72.73 mg g-1 DM, and averaged 69.4 mg g-1 DM. Meanwhile, the \n\nmagnesium varied from 42.02-48.49 mg g-1 DM, and averaged 44.54 mg g-1 DM in August \n\nharvest. The magnesium concentration also decreased in the September harvest, and ranged \n\nbetween 35.05-42.02 mg g-1 DM and averaged 37.86 mg g-1 DM. The sodium and calcium \n\nconcentrations varied between 9.54-8.19 mg g-1 DM and 12.9-11.1 mg g-1 DM over the \n\nexamined period. In addition, Potassium showed considerably low accumulation varying \n\nfrom 3.7-2.83 mg g-1 DM at the harvested periods. The results also showed the slight \n\ndecrease of some ions in the month of September. \n\nInterestingly, at field 2, P.oleracea tissues accumulated largest amounts of chloride and \n\nsodium while magnesium and calcium concentrations were rather low. For instance, \n\nsodium ranged between 18.65-31.51 mg g-1 DM and averaged 26.40 mg g-1 DM in the \n\nAugust harvest, while the September harvest showed slight decreases in sodium uptake, \n\nranging between 18.08-33.09 and averaging 24.85 mg g-1 DM. Furthermore, chloride \n\naccumulation averaged from 59.9 to 56.7 mg g-1 DM in August and September, \n\nrespectively. In addition, higher accumulation of Cl\n-\n and Na+ in the tissues of P.oleracea \n\nplants in moderately saline soil can mean this plant is a relatively a salt removal plant since \n\n\n\nResults and Discussions \n\n 55 \n \n\nsoils contain mainly NaCl. As was the case in field 1, the potassium concentration in field 2 \n\nwas low varying from 3.1 to 2.5 mg g-1 DM in August and September, accordingly. \n\nTable IV.1 \u2013 Chloride Content (mg g-1 DM) in the Tissues of P.oleracea in Khorezm \nRegion. Values are Means and Standard Deviations of Three Treatments \n\n \nIn many cases of our results, August period extracted higher amounts of ions than \n\nSeptember due to several factors: 1) plant transpiration and soil evaporation are higher in \n\nAugust because of higher radiation (temperature and light); 2) air relative humidity is \n\nhigher in September. \n\nIn addition, the extraction of total soluble salts by P.oleracea was similar in both fields \n\n(Fig. IV.7). As can be seen from Fig. IV.7, on average, the plant can extract from 141.8 to \n\n129.4 mg g-1 DM in field 1 over the examined period. In field 2, it averaged between 120.5-\n\n113.8 mg g-1 DM in August and September, correspondingly. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDate Field Plot Cl\n-\n \n\n20.08.06 1 1 75.63 \u00b1 3.76 \n20.08.06 1 2 73.60 \u00b1 3.98 \n20.08.06 1 3 64.16 \u00b1 4.22 \n20.08.06 2 1 54.23 \u00b1 3.55 \n20.08.06 2 2 59.83 \u00b1 5.45 \n20.08.06 2 3 65.73 \u00b1 2.66 \n\nDate Field Plot Cl\n-\n \n\n21.09.06 1 1 72.73 \u00b1 2.60 \n21.09.06 1 2 70.80 \u00b1 3.89 \n21.09.06 1 3 64.70 \u00b1 4.03 \n21.09.06 2 1 52.73 \u00b1 4.40 \n21.09.06 2 2 54.50 \u00b1 3.85 \n21.09.06 2 3 63.10 \u00b1 2.19 \n\n0\n\n60\n\n120\n\n180\n\n1 1 1 2 2 2\n\nExperimental P.oleracea fields\n\nm\ng \n\ng-\n1  \n\np\nla\n\nn\nt\n\nAugust September\n\nFig. IV.7 \u2013 Concentration of Ions [mg g-1] in the Dry Shoot Material of \nP.oleracea Golden Purslane in the Khorezm Region \n\n\n\nResults and Discussions \n\n 56 \n \n\nFig. IV.9 (a) - P.oleracea at Field 1 Fig. IV.9 (b) - P.oleracea at Field 2\n\nDespite low soil salinity levels in field 1, the higher salt uptake, on average, 496.7 kg ha-1 \n\nwas obtained in August, while 511.3 kg ha-1 in September (Fig. IV.8). As shown in Fig.  \n\nIV.8, average salt accumulation of P.oleracea in field 2, in terms of kilogram per hectare, \n\nwas decreased drastically ranging between 49.6-55.5 kg ha-1 during the examined period, \n\nmost probably due to low biomass production. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nThis evergreen P.oleracea species showed to be relatively tolerant to saline conditions and \n\ncan be planted as ornamentals without irrigation. Furthermore, due to higher capillary rise \n\nof groundwater and the lack of plucking weeds after irrigation, field 2 had produced lower \n\namounts of dry matter. Furthermore, as stated earlier, field 1 produced higher plant density \n\nthan field 2, because field 2 was sparsely populated compared to field 1 (Fig. IV.9 a, b).  \n\nFig. IV.8 \u2013 Extraction of Salts from the Soil (kg ha-1) using Dry Matter of \nP.oleracea Golden Purslane in the Khorezm Region \n\n0\n\n150\n\n300\n\n450\n\n600\n\n1 1 1 2 2 2\n\nExperimental P.oleracea fields\n\nkg\n h\n\na-\n1\n\nAugust September\n\n\n\nResults and Discussions \n\n 57 \n \n\nMeanwhile, our analysis showed that P.oleracea accumulated 16.81 % of the total soil \n\nsalts. It should be pointed out that P.oleracea can remove the salts only from 5-10 cm of \n\nsoil surface because of its root length (Table IV.2). Due to low plant density and high soil \n\nsalinity, the extraction of salts from the soil was much lower in field 2. \n\nTable IV.2 - Removal of Soil Salts, using P.oleracea Plant in  \ntwo Different Experimental Fields \n\nField \n? \n\nRoot \ndepth \n[m] \n\nTDS \n [g kg-1] \n\nBD \n [kg m-3]  \n\nSoil salts \n[kg ha-1] \n\nPlant salt \naccumulation \n\n[kg ha-1] \n\nRemoval of \nsalts from soil \n\n[%] \n1 0.10 1.46 1350 2957 497 16.81 \n2 0.10 5.30 1410 11210 50 0.45 \n\n \n\nIV.3 - Experiments with Native Wild Species \n\nIV.3.1 \u2013 Crop Yield and Vegetative Growth \n\nAccording to the results of experiment, C.album had the highest biomass production \n\namongst native wild species ranging between 2689-3243 kg ha-1 DM in August and \n\nSeptember, respectively (Annex 11a and 11b). Moreover, T.hispida had produced slightly \n\nlower biomass production than C.album with the potential yield of 1889-2062 kg ha-1 DM. \n\nThe less efficient crops, in terms of yield productions, were native P.oleracea, \n\nA.lancifolium, K.caspia, G.glabra and A.pseudalhagi. In addition, the data showed a yield \n\nreduction in September harvest as comparing to August for native P.oleracea and G.glabra, \n\nprobably due to climatic parameters such as low light intensity and low air temperature \n\nduring September. Previous results show (Khamidov et al., 2005) that the experimental \n\nregion is often leached in the end of vegetation period, i.e. in the autumn, because of higher \n\nsoil salinity in that period. Thus, lower biomass production could have been obtained in the \n\nautumn season. \n\n\n\nResults and Discussions \n\n 58 \n \n\nThe analysis of the plant height data showed that C.album height reached a mean value of \n\n65 cm in the August harvest but was as high as 82 cm in the September harvest (Annex 13). \n\nHowever, a mean highest value was obtained for A.lancifolium varying from 95 to 85 cm at \n\nharvest. In general, the plant height was not greatly affected by the soil salinity even with \n\nthe highest salt concentration level of 13 dS m-1. This indicates that the plant height is not \n\nextensively influenced by salinity of soil or GWT. However, greater improvement of the \n\nplant height could be attained under either irrigation or/and fertilization. \n\nIV.3.2 \u2013 Salt Accumulation \n\nT.hispida, K.caspia and C.album were found to be the most effective in removing chloride \n\nions from the soil in naturally grown wild species field (Table IV.3). The following \n\nefficient species were native P.oleracea, A.pseudalhagi, G.glabra and A.lancifolium. \n\nFurthermore, the analysis revealed that sodium concentration were relatively high for \n\nT.hispida, C.album and K.caspia plant species ranging between 32.53, 38.74 and 40.09 mg \n\ng-1 DM in the August period (Annex 12). However, in the September period there showed a \n\nslight decrease 25.87, 33.66 and 26.43 mg g-1 DM, respectively for the above-mentioned \n\nspecies. P.oleracea green purslane, C.album and K.caspia showed higher values in \n\naccumulation magnesium content. Since the organic matters of the soils in the investigated \n\narea are relatively low, the potassium concentrations in the plant tissues were also low. \n\n Table IV.3 \u2013 Chloride Content (mg g-1 DM) in the Tissues of Wild Plant Species in \nKhorezm Region.

Native P.oleracea and A.pseudalhagi showed \n\nrelatively low removal of salts from the soil. It is interesting to note that A.lancifolium was \n\ndeveloped in high saline soils but had removed very low amount of salts, and thus can be \n\nconsidered as a salt-tolerant but not a salt removal species.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nThe most efficient wild plant in removing salts from the soil was C.album which removed \n\nbetween 538.4-569.6 kg ha-1 in August and September, respectively (Fig.  IV.11). \n\nFurthermore, T.hispida and K.caspia accumulated between 330.8-370.9 kg ha-1 and 271.5-\n\n275.5 kg ha-1 during August and September periods. The least efficient native wild species \n\nwere identified as A.pseudalhagi, G.glabra and A.lancifolium where they removed less than \n\n150 kg ha-1.

Uzbekistan\u2019s Khorezm region is a semi-arid area which is badly affected by \n\nsoil salinity of which the main causes are the mismanagement of water and land resources \n\nover the past forty years as well as poor drainage infrastructures. As long as these problems \n\ncontinue to intensify, the health and livelihood of the population of the region will be \n\nthreatened and the land and water resources irreversibly affected. \n\nConventional techniques, namely leaching and use of enhancing fertilization have been \n\nused to mitigate soil salinity and to increase the salt tolerance of agricultural crops. \n\nHowever, the intense use of these conventional techniques has also attracted public \n\nattention due to environmental pollution and contamination of groundwater resources. The \n\nphytoremediation technique has become an efficient method to cope with soil salinity in \n\ndeveloped countries. More recently, this method has been applied to the northern region of \n\nUzbekistan with the hope of remediating saline soils and helping to maintain the \n\nsustainability of agricultural lands. Moreover, as cotton is the dominant crop in the \n\nKhorezm region and low yields of cotton are mostly caused by salinity, the introduction of \n\nsalt removing species could potentially create both environmental and economic solutions, \n\nprovided that they can be used as vegetables, ornamentals or fodder, and could also be \n\nintegrated into cultivation/rotation programmes to remediate temporarily saline soils. \n\nThe findings from eight investigated species indicated that annual Portulaca oleracea \n\ngolden purslane is the most potential salt (ion) removal species in the Khorezm region of \n\nUzbekistan. In general, the ideal multipurpose plant species should have a combination of \n\nthe following features: ability to remove high levels of ions from the soil; high biomass \n\n\n\nConclusions and Recommendations \n\n 62 \n \n\nproduction potential; a short vegetation period; low water consumption; good acceptance \n\nby local consumers as a leafy vegetable; tolerance to drought and hot conditions; and easy \n\ncrop management. Taking into consideration all these parameters of the ideal multi-purpose \n\nplant species and the results of the field experiments, the P.oleracea golden purslane has \n\nthe highest potential to mature in salt-affected soils, to remove high levels of salts from the \n\nsoil and to develop on both loamy and sandy soils, which represent the dominant soil \n\ntextures in the region. \n\nHowever, in the experimental area in field 2, high capillary water rise from a shallow \n\ngroundwater table significantly contributed to soil moisture conditions and to the biomass \n\nproduction of the P.oleracea. Many scientists have pointed out that capillary rise may have \n\na negative effect on yield, when the groundwater table is about 0.6 m from soil surface. \n\nThis research proved that due to a shallow groundwater table (~ 0.6) and applied irrigation \n\nwater in field 2, the plant density and biomass production was significantly low. \n\nOn the other hand, no irrigation was required for obtaining the highest biomass production \n\nin field 1 when the water table remained at a depth of about 1.1 m, and slightly saline, \n\nduring the cropping season. It can be concluded that upward flow from shallow water is a \n\nsignificant component in the irrigation water balance of crops as well as optimization of \n\ncrop productivity.  \n\nFurthermore, the analysis showed that among the native wild plants, grown on the salinized  \n\nsoils, Chenopodium album, Tamarix hispida and Karelinia caspia accumulated the highest \n\nion concentrations and can be widely cultivated in the Khorezm region to remediate saline \n\nsoils. Furthermore, native plants have the advantage of being highly adapted to the local \n\nclimatic and edaphic contaminated conditions. \n\n\n\nConclusions and Recommendations \n\n 63 \n \n\nHowever, a major negative aspect of annual P.oleracea was its root profile because it can \n\nonly remove ions within 15 cm of the soil surface. On the other hand, the findings from \n\nnative plants revealed that perennial C.album, K.caspia, T.hispida, G.glabra and \n\nA.lancifolium species were able to remove less salts but from much deeper layers - up to 50 \n\ncm. \n\nPrevious investigations in the Mediterranean area have shown that annual Tetragonia \n\ntetragonioides and perennial Atriplex prostrata crops produced the highest biomass and \n\nwere efficient crops to remove ions from salt-affected soils. For instance, Beltrao et al. \n\n(2006) found that Tetragonia tetragonioides produced 4200 kg ha-1 DM and removed up to \n\n700 kg ha-1 NaCl in Portugal, whereas Cuartero et al. (2002) successfully tested Atriplex \n\nprostrata in Spain, which produced a biomass of 14 tons ha-1 DM and removed about 2 \n\ntons ha-1 ions. In this study, Portulaca oleracea produced about 3950 kg ha-1 DM and \n\nremoved about 500 kg ha-1 ions. Therefore, in future investigations, we need to assess other \n\ncrops, such as Tetragonia tetragonioides and Atriplex prostrata for their efficiencies to \n\nremove ions from the saline soils. \n\nNevertheless, the phytoremediation technique is not the sole method to prevent soil salinity \n\nand to optimize crop productivity. Economically, soil leaching and combined effects of \n\nfertilizers and salts have been an efficient method to control salinity because they are easier \n\nand cheaper than phytoremediation. In the leaching process, ions move from upper layers to \n\ndeeper layers and may reach the aquifers, which is a negative environmental consequence.  \n\nThe plants can be produced but this has a negative impact on deeper soil layers and \n\naquifers. The phytoremediation technique is an environmentally cleaner and safer method \n\nbut is not always economically feasible. Thus, the best way to remediate soil salinity in the \n\nagricultural areas of Khorezm Region and to maintain the natural environment in good \n\n\n\nConclusions and Recommendations \n\n 64 \n \n\ncondition is to combine both conventional and phytoremediation techniques in order to \n\nachieve economic, environmental and social sustainability. However, additional research is \n\nneeded and encouraged on these topics, in particular, how to develop the phytoremediation \n\nmethod into more a economically feasible technique for the remediation of saline soils. \n\n\n\nReferences \n\n 65 \n \n\nVI - REFERENCES \n\nAchilea O.
