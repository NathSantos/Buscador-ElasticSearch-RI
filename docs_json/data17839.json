According to previous,\nregional-scale studies, the belt comprises three longitudinal lithotectonic domains with cratonic, miogeoclinal and\neugeoclinal affinities, respectively from S to N, separated by regional, WNW-ESE trending, generally high-angle\nthrust-strike slip faults. Divergent tectonic evolution models were produced based on interpretations for and against\nthe lateral continuity between these domains. Detailed stratigraphic-structural analysis from a 1:50,000 scale\nmapping carried out (1987-1995) in a 4000km2 area encompassing the interface between the three domains and\nsurrounding two basement gneiss domes in the southern part of the belt, revealed: (1) the lithostratigraphy of the rocks\ndeposited in the cratonic and miogeoclinal segments; (2) innequivocal evidence for the sedimentological, structural\nand metamorphic continuity across the domains boundary faults; (3) the upper section of the sediments deposited in\nthe cratonic domain records the deposition of coarsening-upwards mudstones, siltstones, arkosic sandstones and lithic\nwackes that spreaded from the craton, to the south, across the craton-basin interface and graded into metasiltites and\nphyllites towards the miogeoclinal basin, where they occur in the core of a major basement-cored antiform and are\noverlain by a distinct diamictite formation, thus building up a siliciclastic mcgascquence. The sedimentological\ncharacteristics and innequivocal stratigraphic position of these arkosic sandstones and lithic wackes do not fit in\npreviously suggested thrust-fold belt/foreland basin models; (4) very strong evidence for the miogeoclinal and\neugeoclinal domains being also continuous across their boundary faults, allowing to erect a new stratigraphic template\nfor the Sergipano Belt.\nThe data allow to interpret that sedimentation was tect\u00f4nicaly controlled by the basement domes and normal faults\nlikely to have been inverted during the closure of the basin. The origin of the upper section of the sediments deposited\nin the cratonic domain and the tectonic controls of the sedimentation have relevant implications for the evolution of\nboth the Sergipano Belt and the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton.\n\nKeywords: Stratigraphy, sedimentation and tectonics, Sergipano Belt, Neoproterozoic, Brasiliano Orogeny, S\u00e3o\nFrancisco Craton, Borborema Province.\n\nINTRODUCTION - GEOLOGICAL SETTING       The\nSergipano Belt of NE Brazil is a triangle-shaped, highly\ndeformed wedge lying between the Sao Francisco craton to\nthe south, and the Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif to the north,\nthe latter being part of the Borborema Province. This Province\nis a segment of continental crust intruded by granitoid plutons\nand transected by continental-scale ductile zones of high\nstrain, such as the Patos and Pernambuco shear zones, during\n\nthe Brasiliano / Pan-African Orogeny (Fig. 1, Almeida et al.\n1981, Santos and Brito Neves 1984). The Sao Francisco\nCraton was consolidated by the end of the Paleoproterozoic\nand, nearby the Sergipano Belt, consists of granulites, gneiss,\nmigmatites and granites (Fig. 2, Mascarenhas et al. 1984,\nTeixeira and Figueiredo 1991). The Borborema Province is a\npuzzle of Neoproterozoic belts and gneiss-granite blocks (Fig.\n2) reworked since the Archean and/or created mostly in the\n\n*  - Universidade de Brasilia - Institute de Geoci\u00eancias - Campus Universitano, Asa Norte, CEP 70.910-900, Brasilia, DF, Brazil\n** - Royal Holloway University London, Department of Geology.

The\ncrystalline basement crops out mostly in the Jirau do Pon-\nciano, Itabaiana and Sim\u00e3o Dias amphibolite grade gneiss\ndomes. These are mantled by and involved together with the\nmetasediments in the deformation and regional metamor-\nphism. Gneiss from the Sim\u00e3o Dias dome display a whole rock\nRb-Sr 2505 Ma age (Humphrey and Allard 1969), and or-\nthogneisses of the Jirau do Ponciano dome display a whole\nrock 2500 Ma Rb-Sr isochron age (Amorim et al. 1993). Close\nto the belt, rocks from the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton and the\nPernambuco-Alagoas Massif yield whole rock Rb-Sr ages\naround 1800 Ma, whereas the belt has a Rb-Sr record of a\n673-600Ma old structural-metamorphic evolution (Brito\nNeves and Cordani 1973).\n\nThe Sao Miguel do Aleixo fault separates the Sergipano\nBelt in two longitudinal parts (Santos et al. 1988, Davison and\nSantos 1989). The northern part comprises polydeformed,\ngreenschist to upper amphibolite facies siliciclastic and car-\nbonate metasediments of the Macurure domain, migmatites of\nthe Po\u00e7o Redondo domain, metadacites and metarhyolites of\nthe Maranco domain, and the basic-ultrabasic volcanics and\nintrusives of the Caninde domain, all being intruded by syn-\nto post-tectonic granites around 650Ma (Rb-Sr data in Brito\n\nNeves and Cordani 1973, Chaves 1991). Currently, the lithos-\ntratigraphic units of the Macurure Group to the N of the Jirau\ndo Ponciano dome and the Caninde Domain (Fig. 2) are being\nstudied in more detail (e.g. Amorim and Torres 1994). The\nsouthern part of the belt comprises polydeformed, sub- to\ngreenschist facies siliciclastic and carbonate metasediments\nof the Vaza Barris domain. The Itaporanga fault separates this\ndomain from the cratonic Estancia domain.\n\nThe Sergipano Belt was a cornerstone in the early days of\nthe continental-drift hypothesis (Allard 1969, Allard and\nHurst 1969) and has been regarded, together with the Sao\nFrancisco Craton, as a key for the study of crustal evolution\nin the Neoproterozoic (e.g. Davison and Santos 1989, Murphy\nand Nance 1991). Compared with other Pan-Afri-\ncan/Brasiliano belts (e.g. Trompette 1994), the Sergipano Belt\nhas almost unique gneiss domes around which well preserved\nmetasedimentary cover and basement-cover relationships are\nobservable, particularly around the two domes of its southern\npart.\n\nBased on fundamental lithological descriptions by Hum-\nphrey and Allard (1968, 1969), Jordan (1971) and Silva Filho\n(1976), the first stratigraphic framework was established by\nSilva Filho et al. (1978 a,b), and Silva Filho and Brito Neves\n(1979), who divided the sedimentary-volcanic rock record of\nthe Sergipano Belt in the Estancia, Miaba/Vaza Barris and\nMacurure groups (Fig. 2) and interpreted it in terms of the\nlaterally continuous, cratonic, miogeoclinal and eugeoclinal\ndomains of a single basin deepening northwards away from\nthe S\u00e3o Francisco Craton. The cratonic domain comprises the\nEstancia Group, which rests unconformably on the craton and\nis sub-divided into three formations (lower argillites, sand-\nstones and conglomerates; intermediate carbonates; and upper\nmudstones, siltstones and sandstones), and the Palmares For-\nmation (Fig. 2; massive sandstones, local conglomerates and\nlithic wackes), resting unconformably on both the Estancia\nGroup and the craton. The miogeoclinal domain comprises the\nbasal Miaba Group, unconformably deposited around the\nItabaiana dome and consisting of basal quartzites (minor\nconglomerates), intermediate pebbly phyllites, meta-argillites\nand greywackes, and upper metacarbonates. The Vaza Barris\nGroup, spreading on the rest of the domain, and consisting of\nphyllites, metagreywackes, metavolcanics, metadiamictites\nand metacarbonates. The eugeoclinal domain comprises the\nMacurur\u00e9 Group (basal quartzites and upper schists and meta-\nvolcanics, all intruded by granites) and the unconformably\noverlying Jua Formation (undeformed coarse-grained silici-\nclastics). The latter is deposited in a small graben nearby the\neastern border of the Tucano basin (Fig. 2).\n\nThose authors adopted a model (also in Silva Filho 1982)\nwhereby the syn-tectonic erosion of a collisional thrust-and-\nfold belt would supply terrigenous sediments for the uncon-\nformable deposition of the Palmares and Jua formations,\nrespectively as foreland and intramontane basin deposits sup-\nplied from the north. Many authors maintained these ideas and\npostulated tectonic models for a frontal collision of the Per-\nnambuco-Alagoas Massif and the Sao Francisco Craton (e.g.\nBrito Neves et al. 1977, Jardim de Sa et al. 1981, 1986,\nCampos Neto and Brito Neves 1987). However, challenging\nthe concept of a single basin, Santos et al. (1988) and Davison\nand Santos (1989) defined the Maranco, Po\u00e7o Redondo and\nCaninde domains after a 1:100,000 scale geological mapping\nof the central part of the belt, and interpreted the six lithotec-\ntonic domains of the Sergipano Belt as terranes accreted\nduring oblique collision.\n\nEven after Saes (1984) has described in detail a gradual\ntransition throughout the cratonic sediments, arguing for cau-\ntion on the origin of the Palmares Formation, then incorpo-\nrated at the top of his Estancia Group, the whole stratigraphy\nof the belt and the thrust belt-foreland basin model remained\n\n186\n\n\n\nRevista Brasileira de Geociencias, Volume 25, 1995\n\nFigure 2 - Simplified geological map of the Sergipano Belt.

An up to date tectonic sinthesis\nof the belt is available in D'el-Rey Silva (1995b).\n\nThis paper reports the analysis which resulted in a substan-\ntial reassessment of the stratigraphy and lithostratigraphic-\nstructural correlations across the southern part of the belt\n(D'el-Rey Silva 1992), coupled with data from more recent\nresearch (1993-1995). The paper describes the geology and\nstratigraphy of the Itabaiana dome area and introduces a\nstratigraphic framework for the Est\u00e2ncia, Miaba/Vaza B arris\nand Macururure domains, as part of a continuous basin whose\nevolution of architecture and sedimentary infilling is then\ninterpreted in terms of tect\u00f4nically controlled sedimentation.\nThe results of this research have also allowed to describe in\nenough detail the geology of the basement domes and to\ninterpret their evolution in terms of syn-depositional exten-\nsional structures that evolved into basement-cored overturned\nantiforms during the D1-D3 deformation of the area (D'el-\nRey Silva 1992, 1995a).\n\nGEOLOGY OF THE ITABAIANA DOME AREA In-\ntroduction The Itabaiana dome area (Fig. 3) comprises\nan amphibolite grade granite-gneiss complex cropping out in\ntwo basement domes mantled by a highly deformed green-\nschist grade metavolcano-sedimentary cover of quartzite,\ndiamictite, phyllite and carbonate, together with almost unde-\nformed and nonmetamorphosed sediments occupying the SW\npart of the area. The Itabaiana dome is an elliptical structure\nsurrounded by a series of prominent quartzite ranges around\nthe town of Itabaiana. The Sim\u00e3o Dias dome is much smaller\nand continues eastwards along a very narrow strip of mylonitic\ngneisses. The stratigraphic record shows a wide variation of\nlithofacies and thicknesses throughout the area and comprises\nthe Miaba, Sim\u00e3o Dias and Vaza Barris groups, subdivided\ninto eight formations (Fig. 4). The Sergipe-Alagoas Mesozoic\nbasin, not included in this analysis, occupies the SSE corner\nof the area.\n\nThe basement consists of granodiorite gneiss, locally in-\ntruded by basic-ultrabasic rocks (amphibolites, hornblende\ngabbro, minor pyroxenites) and deformed porphyritic gran-\nites. The gneiss is composed of plagioclase, quartz, k-feldspar,\nbiotite, hornblende, muscovite, sericite, chlorite and epidote.\nAccessories are apatite, sphene, zircon, and opaque minerals.\nGarnet occurs locally. These are highly anysotropic rocks\nbasically differing in the more or less continuous metamorphic\nbanding, which is normally defined by l-10cm thick layers of\nfine to medium grained quartz and feldspars intercalated with\n?lcm thick biotite-muscovite- epidote rich layers.\n\nThe basement/cover contact is generally sheared, except\nlocally in the eastern margin of the Itabaiana dome, where\nbasal (meta)conglomerates of the metasedimentary cover lie\nunconformably on an erosion surface affecting gneisses dis-\nplaying the strong anisotropy described before (Davison and\nSantos 1989, D'el-Rey Silva 1992, 1995a). Therefore the\nmetamorphic banding in the basement is older than the\nBrasiliano Cycle, and it is most probably Archean- Paleopro-\nterozoic because of the radiometric data previously mentioned\nin this paper.\n\nThe metamorphic banding of the basement (Sn) and the\nsedimentary layering of the cover (So) both record similar\npolyphase deformational evolution attributable to the\nBrasiliano Orogeny. The main mappable structures are sub-\nvertical, WNW-ESE trending thrust, strike-slip, normal faults\nand major F2 phase folds, whereas a major stratigraphic\ninversion on the western border is ascribed to Fl-related\n\nnappes and recumbent folds (Fig. 3). From S to N, the main\nfaults are the Jacare, Itaporanga, Sim\u00e3o Dias, Escarpa, Pelada,\nMocambo, Ribeiropolis and Dores faults. The main strike-slip\nshear zones are the Vaza Barris and the Mocambo faults. Other\nsubvertical, NW-SE to E-W striking shear zones cut across\nthe eastern and southern margins of the Itabaiana dome. The\nItaporanga fault roughly corresponds to the boundary between\nalmost flat-lying cratonic sediments, to the south, and the\ndeformed wedge to the north. Within this wedge Sn and So\nare subparallel to the S1//S2 foliations. Overall these struc-\ntures generally trend WNW-ESE and dip steeply to NNE,\nexcept in the hinge zones of the larger F2 folds where the axial\nplanar foliation is steeper than the folded structures, such as\nobserved in the interior and along the western side of the\nItabaiana dome, and the Paripiranga anticline to the W of the\nSim\u00e3o Dias dome (Fig. 3).\n\nStratigraphy The stratigraphy of the study area (Fig.\n4) results from the combination of data on 12 sections across\nthe basement-cover contact around the gneiss domes (Fig. 5)\nand comprises the Miaba, Sim\u00e3o Dias and Vaza Barris groups,\nfully recognized along sections AA', BB' and JJ'. The other\nsections are important to show the lateral equivalence of the\nlithofacies. Despite the area is not 100% covered by outcrops,\nthe sections were composed after the study of numerous,\ngood-quality exposures along streams, rivers, roads and\nquarries. Composite sections with these characteristics have\nbeen produced very recently for other Neoproterozoic basins\n(e.g. Knoll et al. 1995, Christie-Blick et al 1995). Although\nthickness measurements (Fig. 5) are generally hampered by\nthe polyphase deformation, the relative thicknesses of each\nformation can be traced across the area.\n\nThe Miaba Group consists of the Itabaiana quartzites, the\nRibeiropolis pebbly phyllites and the Jacoca metacarbonates.\nGroup thicknesses vary from ?200m on the western side of\nthe Sim\u00e3o Dias dome, to ?1100m on the eastern and western\nsides of the Itabaiana dome.\n\nThe Itabaiana Formation consists of a sandy and a muddy\nlithofacies. The former surrounds most of the Itabaiana dome\nand also occurs as a narrow, discontinuous belt in the western\nmargin of the Sim\u00e3o Dias dome (the Itabaiana quartzites of\nHumphrey and Allard, 1968, 1969). The muddy lithofacies\nmainly occurs along narrow ranges to the north of the area,\nalso in part of the northern margin of the Itabaiana dome and\nin the western margin of the Sim\u00e3o Dias dome. The Formation\nis 400-700m thick in the eastern and western borders of the\nItabaiana dome, and ?30-200m in the rest of the area.\n\nThe most typical section (JJ', Fig. 5) starts with local, thin\nbodies of matrix-supported, trough and tabular cross-bedded\nconglomerates and conglomeratic sandstones, with basement-\nderived clasts, which pass gradually to the 100's m-thick\nsequence of white to grey, homogeneously medium- to fine-\ngrained, sub-rounded, planar cross-bedded quartzites (feld-\nspathic near the base) also displaying fluid-escape structures.\nOpaque minerals and tourmaline are common accessories\nobserved in thin sections. Humphrey and Allard (1969) pre-\nsented paleocurrent data from relatively common tabular\ncrossed beds at ?lm-scale, and concluded for a sedimentary\nflow to NNW-NNE. D'el-Rey Silva (1992) presented further\nobservations indicating local sedimentary flows to the E and\nW, in basal conglomeratic quartzites, to the west of the Sim\u00e3o\nDias dome and in the middle section to the east of the Itabaiana\ndome. The very top of the formation, along section JJ', con-\nsists of grey to brown-red, fine-grained metasandstones, me-\ntasiltites and meta-argillites, or may also consist of thin lenses\nof conglomerattic quartzites with ?lcm-size, generally\nrounded basement-derived clasts. The muddy lithofacies con-\nsists of micaceous quartzites and/or 10-100cm-thick layers of\n\n188\n\n\n\nRevista Brasileira de Geociencias, Volume 25,1995\n\nFigure 3 - Simplified geological map of the Itabaiana dome area.

It is ?100m thick\nin the western margin of the Sim\u00e3o Dias dome and may be\nabsent or attain ?300m on both the eastern and western\nmargins of the Itabaiana dome. Thickness ?500m is likely to\noccur on the southern and northern margins of this dome. The\ncontact is generally gradational with the Itabaiana Formation,\nbut is sheared along a top to ESE low-angle ramp, in one\nlocallity of the western margin of the Itabaiana dome.\n\nDue to the variety of lithofacies, this formation lacks a\ntype-section, but generally the pebbly phyllites and metacon-\nglomerates occupy basal positions and the phyllitic facies\noccurs towards the top of the unit. The best section (JJ', Fig.\n5) starts with white to grey or light brown, silty meta-argillites\nwith parallel stratification, containing intercalations of up to\nl0m-thick metagrey wackes and graded bedded conglomeratic\nmetasandstones and pebbly phyllites, with clasts from base-\nment rocks and quartzite. This sequence passes to finely\nlaminated grey meta-argillites and light brown metasiltites,\n\nwhich are overlain by light brown, calcareous phyllites with\nintercalations of carbonaceous phyllites, suggesting a gradual\ntransition upwards into the Jacoca Formation.\n\nTo the north of the Itabaiana dome (along section GG', Fig.\n5) the Ribeir\u00f3polis Formation starts with red brown to purple\nsilty phyllites seen in gradual passage with the Itabaiana\nFormation, and proceeds northward with intercalated pebbly\nphyllites, light brown-purple phyllites and possibly porphy-\nroclastic volcanic rocks with similar colours. Weathered\nmetarhyolites and metadacites have been described as part of\nthis sequence, immediately to the north of the Itabaiana dome\narea (Santos et al 1988).\n\nThe Jacoca Formation conformably overlies the Ribeir\u00f3po-\nlis Formation and rests unconformably on Itabaiana quartz-\nites, to the west of the Itabaiana dome (section EE', Fig. 5). It\ncomprises lithofacies of metacarbonates and metarhythmites.\n\nThe typical section (Fig. 6) starts with a 3m thick layer of\nlaminated white-light grey, l-3cm thick beds of metadolomite\ncontaining ?lcm thick beds of pyrite and chalcopyrite. These\nare overlain by a ?15m thick layer of metarhythmites, which\nconsist of intercalated, laterally continuous, up to l0cm-thick\nlayers of thinly laminated metadolomite, light brown\nmetachert and dark grey to black, calcareous phyllite, overlain\nby a ?10m-thick column of 1m-thick layers of massive\n\n189\n\n\n\nRevista Brasileira de Geocidncias, Volume 25,1995\n\nFigure 4 - Summary stratigraphy of the Itabaiana dome area.\nFromD'el-Rey Silva (1992).

Thin section of the thinly laminated\nmetadolomite displays a typical marble texture of equigranu-\nlar recrystallised calcite grains, interbedded with ?lmm-thick\nlayers of sericite, chlorite, biotite, very fine-grained quartz and\nfeldspar defining a layer-parallel foliation. This unit is over-\nlain by a ?40m thick sequence of intercalated, ?l-10cm thick\nlayers of grey metalimestone, calcarenite and dark grey-black,\nlocally carbonaceous phyllite. These units display parallel\nlaminations, wave-truncated current ripples and pass upwards\ninto a ?200m thick sequence of ?lm thick layers of light grey\nmetadolomites. Primary structures such as parallel lamina-\ntion, fluid-escape structures, small-scale wave-reworking\nstructures and tabular cross stratifications are observed in the\nwestern margin of the Itabaiana dome. In this area, Guimaraes\net al. (1991) also described abundant oolites and intraclasts,\nrespectively in the lower and upper section of the Jacoca\nFormation. In the western side of the Sim\u00e3o Dias dome the\nmetarhythmites consist of ?100m thick layers of brown-grey\nphyllites with ?10m thick layers of white to grey\n\nmetadolomite which was disrupted and occurs in lenses, prob-\nably due to the deformation. To the north of the Mocambo\nfault (Fig. 3) the metarhythmites are defined by generally\ncontinuous, ?lm thick layers of dark grey-black, fine-grained\nmetalimestone, intercalated with ?10cm thick layers of light\nbrown to dark or variegated metapelites, metasiltites and\nminor, fine-grained metasandstones.\n\nThe Sim\u00e3o Dias Group is a ?400-700m thick coarsening-\nupwards siliciclastic sequence deposited on the Craton and in\nthe basin. It conformably overlies the Miaba Group in the\nstudied area, and comprises the interfingered Lagarto-Pal-\nmares, Jacare and Frei Paulo formations. The group is a new\nstratigraphic unit identified in the southern part of the Sergi-\npano Belt and the name refers to the tectonicaly significant\noutcrops found principally to the west of the Sim\u00e3o Dias\ndome, in the core of the Paripiranga anticline (section BB' and\nFig. 7a). This group was originally termed Lagarto Group by\nD'el-Rey Silva (1992) who also described the complete sec-\ntions JJ' (Fig. 5 and Fig. 7b) and LL' (Fig. 8). The new name\nis to avoid confusion with the well known Lagarto Formation.\n\nThe Lagarto-Palmares Formation (D'el-Rey Silva, 1992)\nin general conformably overlies the Jacoca Formation, but the\noutcrops along section BB' rest above outcrops of Ribeiropo-\nlis metavolcanics. This may suggest an unconformable rela-\ntionship due to the lack of the Jacoca Formation, though not\nproven because the direct contact is not observed. The forma-\ntion also lies in fault contact with the crystalline basement, far\nto the south, in the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton (Silva Filho 1982,\nSaes 1984). The formation comprises a ?200m thick basal unit\nof mudstones and siltstones with lenses of fine-grained, planar\ncross-bedded sandstones which occur in the southern limit of\nthe Itabaiana dome area (Fig. 8a). This unit spreads from the\ncraton onto the basin's border and gradually passes up-sec-\ntion, towards the north, into an intermediate unit consisting of\n?200m of fine-grained sandstones with repeated cycles of\nparallel lamination capped by small-scale, symmetric wave\nripples. Sharp truncation surfaces are observed at the base of\neach cycle. This unit is ?200m-thick and consists of 10cm-\nthick layers of fine- to medium-grained, brown to grey, mi-\ncaceous, parallel laminated (meta)sandstones, with ?5cm-\nscale abundant symmetric wave ripples.\n\nUpwards, these rocks pass gradually into the upper unit\n(Fig. 9), a ?120m thick sequence consisting of metre-scale\nlayers of massive or parallel laminated, greenish grey, calcite-\ncemented, micaceous fine- to medium-grained sandstones and\nlithic wackes, with intercalations of laterally continuous,\n?lcm-thick layers of red-brown mudstones. D'el-Rey Silva\n(1992) described wavy-surfaces of truncation of the sandstone\nlayers and sigmoidal-shaped surfaces of truncation of the\nmuddy layers, above which micaceous sandstone layers were\ndeposited, indicating an interplay between periods of quies-\ncence and periods of sedimentation with higher energy, and\nalso described ?1 cm-thick continuous muddy layers com-\nmonly disrupted into ?10cm-wide disk-like mudstone frag-\nments, forming local intraformational breccias or laterally\ncontinuous thin layers of platy, reddish brown fragments.\nPetrographically, the upper unit consists of submature mas-\nsive sandstones composed of subangular to subrounded, gen-\nerally 0.15-0.45mm size grains of quartz, K-feldspar, plagio-\nclase, opaque minerals, zircon, granite, aggregates of micro-\ncrystalline quartz, calcite, epidote, and flakes of muscovite\nand chlorite. The erosion of these rocks commonly result into\n?1 m-size rounded boulders that dominate the topography, and\nthis erosion pattern is controlled by the intersection of bedding\nand orthogonal fractures (Fig. 8b).\n\nThe lower and intermediate units belong to the Lagarto\nFormation, whereas the upper unit stands for the Palmares\n\n190\n\n\n\nFigure 5 - Stratigraphic sections around the Itabaiana and Sim\u00e3o Dias basement domes.

(1978 a,b) and Silva Filho\n(1982). The overall estimated thickness of the Lagarto-Pal-\nmares Formation in the Itabaiana dome area (?720m; Fig. 9)\nfits with the thickness proved below the Tucano Basin by oil\nindustry wells (Silva Filho et al., 1978b). However, the maxi-\nmum thickness of the upper unit is actually unknown, as it is\ntruncated by the topography. A section of ?2500m is found in\na partially fault-bounded depocentre where the formation is\nin contact with the crystalline basement, far in the cratonic\narea (Saes, 1984). This author described in detail a gradual\ncontact relationship between the Lagarto and Palmares For-\nmations, too, in an area ?100km to the south of the Itabaiana\ndome. In addition, Saes (1984) showed detailed paleocurrent\n\ndata indicating a sedimentary flow to NNE, during the depo-\nsition of the Lagarto and Palmares Formations.\n\nAltogether, the large inventory of data mentioned up to here\nmakes hard to believe that the origin of the Palmares Forma-\ntion lies on the erosion of the Sergipano Belt. Just in contrary,\nas D'el-Rey Silva stated (1992), the Palmares Formation must\nreflect the erosion of high grade granite-gneiss terranes and\nlow grade supracrustals (greenstone belts) that are found to\nthe south, in the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton, relatively close to the\nbasin's border, and this explains the composition of the La-\ngarto-Palmares arkoses and lithic greywackes. In fact these\nformations are truly interfingered, as demonstrated by further\nfield observation (1993-1995) by the main author, C.A.\nRosiere (UFMG) and B.B.

The metasiltites are mappable in\ngradual transition from the Lagarto-Palmares Formation\nalong an E-W trending band in the southern part of the area\nand in the core of the Paripiranga anticline. The best exposures\nare along section LL' (Fig. 9), where thickness is ?150-200m,\nand in the core of the Paripiranga anticline where it is much\nthinner (section BB', Fig. 5). In the vicinity of faults and shear\nzones, these rocks attain a dark brown-black colour, are silici-\nfied and indurated, displaying a vitreous texture (e.g.: out-\ncrops along section LL' and along the Jacar\u00e9 fault).\n\nThe Frei Paulo Formation is ?100m-thick to the west of the\nSim\u00e3o Dias dome (sections BB' and CC'), and ?300m to\n?500m elsewhere, particularly in the Vaza Barris valley area\n(sections DD', EE', FF'). It comprises several lithotypes: light\ngrey to brown, silty and variegated phyllites (Fig.8d) with\nlocal intercalations of carbonate-cemented arkosic metasand-\nstones and wackes, quartz-sericite-chlorite phyllites and meta-\ngreywackes (Fig.8e), metarhythmites consisting of thinly\ninterbedded black phyllites, metasiltites, calcilutites and silty\nphyllites (Fig.8f), and local, thinly interbedded\nmetalimestones and metagreywackes (Fig.8g). Basic-inter-\n\nmediate metavolcanics may be present, as the ?10m thick\nlenses found to the east of the Itabaiana dome (section JJ').\n\nEach of the lithofacies of this formation dominates but is\nnot exclusive in one part of the area. To the south of the\nEscarpa fault, the Frei Paulo Formation consists of variegated\nsilty phyllites (FP1, Fig. 3). To the north of the Mocambo fault,\nthe Frei Paulo Formation commonly consists of light brown-\ncream silty phyllites, with mappable bodies of fine- to me-\ndium-grained, brownish-greenish grey, calcite-cemented\nmetasandstones, petrographically similar to the Lagarto-Pal-\nmares (meta)sandstones and lithic (meta)greywackes (FP2).\nBetween the Escarpa and Pelada faults, and eastwards of the\nItabaiana dome (FP3, Fig.3), the dominant lithofacies are the\ngreen-blue grey, pyritous, quartz-sericite-chlorite phyllites,\nmetagreywackes, metarhythmites, minor lenses of metasand-\nstones and interbedded metagreywackes and metalimestones.\n\nThe Vaza Barris Group occurs only to the north of the\nItaporanga fault (Fig.3) and is a ?2000m-thick sequence un-\nconformably overlying the previous formations and the crys-\ntalline basement. It comprises the Palestina metadiamictites\nand the Olhos D'agua metacarbonates and metarhythmites.\n\nThe Palestina Formation consists of metadiamictites, peb-\nbly phyllites and minor phyllites, with local lenses of quartz-\nites. These rocks contain granules, pebbles and cobbles of\nbasement rocks, as well as quartzites, phyllites and metacar-\nbonates. These strain markers are commonly flattened and\nelongated, and are all supported by a green-blue grey, gener-\nally fine-grained and foliated sericite-chlorite matrix (Fig.\nl0a). The contact with the Frei Paulo Formation is commonly\nobscure, although it appears locally to be gradational (section\nJJ'). The formation is also seen in close proximity to the\ncrystalline basement and the Itabaiana Formation, which may\nsuggest unconformable relationships. The typical area of oc-\ncurrence is between the Escarpa and Pelada faults (the Vaza\nBarris river area), where the thickness is >500m and >10cm\nsize clasts are common. Around the Sim\u00e3o Dias dome the\nthickness is ?100m, the matrix is siltier than anywhere else\nand >10cm size clasts are rare, although Im-size blocks of\ngranitic rocks are found near the western end of the trace of\nthe Sim\u00e3o Dias fault, to the WNW of the Sim\u00e3o Dias dome.\nTo the east of the Itabaiana dome, the metadiamictites occur\nalong the Jacarecica river (Fig.7b) above variegated phyllites,\nquartz-sericite-chlorite phyllites and intercalated metasand-\nstones of the Frei Paulo Formation. It contains boulders and\npebbles of Itabaiana quartzite and Lagarto-Palmares me-\ntasandstones (Fig.lOb) never found in the rest of the area or\ndescribed in the literature (D'el-Rey Silva 1992).\n\nThe Olhos D'agua Formation consists of metacarbonates\nthat conformably overlie the Palestina diamictites, but are also\nseen highly deformed in contact with the Lagarto-Palmares\nFormation, in the SW corner of the area, and also with the\ncrystalline basement, along the Sim\u00e3o Dias and Itaporanga\nfaults (Fig. 3). It comprises three different lithofacies (base to\ntop): laminated metacarbonate rhythmites; oolitic metali-\nmestones and metadolostones; mixed metacarbonate and sili-\nciclastics (metarhythmites). The thickness is ?1300m around\nthe Sim\u00e3o Dias dome and probably also to the north of the\nPelada fault. It seems to be much less, perhaps ?200m, possi-\nbly due to tectonic thinning, to the south of the Itabaiana dome.\nThe Olhos D'\u00e1gua Formation also occurs in the NW corner of\nthe area and in two bodies cut by the Propri\u00e1 fault, to the east\nof the Itabaiana dome (Fig. 3), where the laminated metacar-\nbonate rhythmites dominate.\n\nThe best exposures are from the Sim\u00e3o Dias dome to the\nnorth (A A', Fig. 5). The section starts with hundreds of metres\nof laminated metacarbonate rhythmites, which consist of\n?10cm-thick interbedded layers of light and dark grey-black,\nfine-grained metalimestones, with intercalated ?1cm-thick\nlayers of light brown metasiltites, brown to purple metapelites\n\n195\n\n\n\nRevista Brasileira de Geociencias, Volume 25,1995\n\nand chert (Fig.l0c). Small- to medium-scale planar cross\nstratifications are found locally. These rocks pass up section\ninto a sequence (probably also 100's of metres thick) of\nmetalimestones and metadolostones consisting of interbed-\nded, ?10cm-thick layers of fine-grained, black\nmetalimestones in many places oolitic and pelloidal, with\noncoid structures (Fig.l0d). This lithofacies also contains\n<10mm-thick intercalations of brown metapelite, and 10-\nl00m-thick layers of grey to light-brown metadoloarenite\ndisplaying small-scale planar cross stratification, wave-like\nerosion surfaces, intraclasts and graded bedding (Fig.l0e).\n\nUpwards, this sequence passes gradually into hundreds of\nmetres of metarhythmites, which consist of fine-grained, 10-\n100cm thick beds of black limestone, intercalated with 1-\n10cm thick layers of brown to red-brown, commonly vari-\negated, pyritic metapelite (Fig. 10f). These metarhythmites\nform the WNW-ESE trending hills that occur along the Es-\ncarpa and Pelada faults, and the siliciclastic layers become\nincreasingly significant northwards. Close to the northwestern\nside of the Itabaiana dome, along the Salgado river, the\nmetarhythmites contain 10-100cm thick intercalations of dark\ngrey-black phyllite (D'el-Rey Silva 1992).\n\nSTRATIGRAPHY OF THE SOUTHERN PART OF\nTHE SERGIPANO BELT The definition of the Sim\u00e3o\nDias Group as a craton-basin continues blanket of siliciclas-\ntics in the southern part of the belt (Fig. 11) led to redistribute\nthe cratonic domain sediments, all previously incorporated in\nthe Estancia Group by Saes (1984), and resulted in the lateral\ncorrelation with the metasediments of the miogeoclinal do-\nmain. The Estancia Group (D'el-Rey Silva 1992) comprises\nbasal arkosic sandstones, argillites and diamictites (Juete For-\nmation) overlain by carbonates (Acaua Formation), and cor-\nrelates with the Miaba Group, the base of the miogeoclinal\ndomain, where the Sim\u00e3o Dias and Vaza barris groups also\noccur.\n\nMoreover, taking into account the conclusive evidence for\nsedimentary, metamorphic, structural and geophysical conti-\nnuity between the cratonic, miogeoclinal and eugeoclinal\ndomains of the belt, despite of their faulted boundaries (D'el-\nRey Silva 1992, 1995a), the Estancia-Miaba, Sim\u00e3o Dias and\nVaza Barris groups correlate with the Macurure Group me-\ntasediments to the north. The age of the sedimentation in the\nSergipano basin has been constrained more recently by U-Pb\ndata from Macurure metavolcanics and other isotopic data\npointing to a l,000Ma old event of rifting recorded in most of\nthe Borborema Province (Brito Neves et al. 1993).\n\nThe Juete-Itabaiana/Ribeiropolis lateral correlation is war-\nranted by the fact that these are siliclastic sediments uncon-\nformably overlying the crystalline basement and overlain by\ncarbonates of the laterally equivalent Acaua and Jacoca for-\nmations. Moreover the meta-arkosic sandstones and red-\nbrown phyllites of the Itabaiana Formation may be correlated\nwith arkosic sandstones and red-brown argillites in the Juete\nFormation of Silva Filho et al. (1978 a,b) and Saes (1984),\nand the same is valid for conglomerates and diamictites in both\nenvironments. This correlation was in fact done by Silva\nFilho et al. (1978 a,b), including even the basal conglomerates\nand quartzites of the Macurure Group, deposited around the\nJirau do Ponciano dome.\n\nMegasequence stratigraphy in the Sergipano\nBelt The basic principles of sequence (and seismic) strati-\ngraphy (Hubbard et al. 1985, Wagoner et al. 1987, Christie-\nBlick 1991) imply to study sedimentary successions in terms\nof the arrange of facies and associated discontinuities, either\non surface or through seismic reflection data. These principles\nwere established in Phanerozoic areas but have more recently\n\nbeen also applied to Proterozoic basins (e.g. Christie-Blick et\nal. 1988, 1995, Knoll et al. 1995, Saylor et al. 1995).\n\nDue to a poor biostratigraphic resolution, definition of\nNeoproterozoic depositional sequences is commonly more\ndifficult than of Phanerozoic counterparts (Christie-Blick et\nal. 1995). These authors established several points for physi-\ncal recognition of sequence boundaries, i.e. unconformities\nand correlative conformities, and emphasized that successful\nstudies are easier to achieve in less deformed, ?5km-thick\nstratigraphic sections with relatively continuous exposures\nalong strike.\n\nThe southern part of the Sergipano Belt is not the best area\nfor such purposes, particularly because the D1-D2 deforma-\ntion brought into parallelism the S0-S1-S2 planes in large\ntracts of the area (D'el-Rey Silva 1992, 1995b); furthermore,\ncontinues outcrops are uncommon, although there are numer-\nous of good quality. Even so, we list below some of the\nevidence indicating that important unconformities may have\nexisted within the stratigraphic succesion of the study area: 1\n- some conglomeratic facies intercalated in the Itabaiana and\nRibeiropolis formations may have been incised valleys; 2 -\nuplift and erosion of internal parts of the basin as recorded by\nthe Ribeir\u00f3polis and Palestina diamictites; 3 - the wide variety\nof lithofacies; 4 - the lack of some formations, like the\nRibeir\u00f3polis and Jacoca, around the Itabaiana dome, may be\ninterpreted as non-depositional surfaces; 5 - moreover, con-\ncordant strata do not rule out the existence of unconformities\nin a basin (Christie-Blick et al. 1995).\n\nThe tracing down of systems tracts within sedimentary\nsequences would be too speculative in a section across the\nSergipano basin. However, the establishment of boundaries\nof megasequences is feasible, as an amalgamation of silici-\nclastic or carbonate sequences, and has allowed the recogni-\ntion of two distinct sedimentary cycles in the southern part of\nthe Sergipano Belt (Cycles I and II, Fig. 11; D'el-Rey Silva\n1992). Cycle I comprises the lower siliciclastic megasequence\n(Juete-Itabaiana and Ribeiropolis formations) and the lower\ncarbonate megasequence (Acaua-Jacoca Formation). Cycle II\ncomprises the upper siliciclastic megasequence (Sim\u00e3o Dias\nGroup-Palestina Formation) and the upper carbonate megase-\nquence (Olhos D'\u00e1gua Formation). These cycles allow to\ninterpret basin evolution in terms of periods of extensional\ntectonism followed by tectonic quiescence (discussed ahead\nin this paper), instead of understanding evolution of each\ngroup individually, and thus justifying group boundaries\nwithin a megasequence (Fig. 11), similarly of what has been\ndone in other Neoproterozoic areas (e.g. Christie-Blick 1995).\n\nTHE SERGIPANO BASIN       Lithofacies analysis\nWithin the Lower Siliciclastic Megasequence, deposition\nstarted with alluvial/fluvial sediments in a continental envi-\nronment (trough cross-bedded basal conglomerates, conglom-\neratic sandstones, diamictites, arkoses and argillites of the\nJuete-Itabaiana Formation, and continued with the prograda-\ntion of the bulk of ?lm-size planar cross-bedded, relatively\nwell-sorted and pure Itabaiana quartzites, which compare with\nother siliciclastic sequences deposited in a well-washed, shal-\nlow marine environment (cf.

The lithofacies of\ninterbeded arkosic metasandstones and red brown phyllites\nmay be interpreted to indicate uplift and erosion of inner-basin\ncrystalline basement areas or blocks (cf. Dickinson and\nSuczek 1979), whereas the Ribeir\u00f3polis phyllites record the\nupper and finer fraction invaded at times by intrabasinal clasts\nand minor volcanics.\n\nIn the Sim\u00e3o Dias Group, the vertical succession of primary\nstructures of the Lagarto-Palmares Formation strongly sug-\ngests increasing energy in the sedimentary environment (cf.\nNio et al. 1980, Tillman 1985) and compares with those\nexpected in coarsening-upwards siliciclastic sequences de-\n\n196\n\n\n\nRevista Brasileirade Geociencias, Volume 25, 1995\n\nFigure 10 - The Vaza Barris Group: a - Highly foliated\nPalestina metadiamictite with flattened clasts of basement\nrocks,   Vaza Barris River    valley    (to the west of the\nItabaiana  dome);  b   -  Palestina  metadiamictite  with\nboulders of Itabaiana quartzite and Lagarto-Palmares\nmetasandstone,   Jacarecica  river,   to  the  east  of the\nItabaiana dome; c -Thinly laminated metalimestone in the\nbasal unit of the Olhos D '\u00e1gua Formation, S of the Sim\u00e3o\nDias   dome; d - Oncolitic  black  metalimestone of the\nintermediate unit; e -Wave-reworked dolomitic layers of\nthe  intermediate  unit,  NW of   Sim\u00e3o Dias   (note  the\nintracalasts,   the  gradded  bedding  and  the  arrowed\nshrinkage fractures); f- Interlayered black  metalimestone\nand variegated   phyllite of the upper unit, d-f are from\noutcrops along section AA' (Fig. 5).\nFigura 10 - O Grupo Vaza Barris: a -Metadiamictito Palestina muito foliado e exibindo clastos achatados de rochas do embasamento, em afloramento a oeste do domo\nde Itabaiana; b - Metadiamictito Palestina com mata\u00e7\u00f5es e seixos de quartzito Itabaiana e meta-arenito Lagarto-Palmares, ao longo do rio Jacarecica a leste do domo\nde Itabaiana; c - Metacarbonatos fmamente acamadados da unidade basal da Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Olhos D'\u00e1gua, a sul do domo de Sim\u00e3o Dias; d - Metacarbonato oncolltico\nda unidade intermediaria; e - Camadas de dolomite da unidade intermedi\u00e1ria, mostrando evidencia de retrabalhamento por ondas durante a sedimenta\u00e7\u00e3o- f -\nMetacarbonato cinza escuro a preto intercalado com filito na unidade superior, d-f s\u00e3o de afloramentos ao longo da se\u00e7\u00e3o AA' (Fig 5).\n\n197\n\n\n\nRevista Brasileira de Geoctencias, Volume 25,1995\n\nposited on shallow marine platforms (shelf sandstones, cf.\nWalker 1985). The basal unit matches the typical interbedded\nsandstone-and-mudstone facies deposited by storm-induced\nturbiditic currents below the storm wave base (cf. Walker\n1985, Tillman 1985). The small-scale, wave-ripple cross\nstratification, with local indications of bidirectional flows, and\nthe sand-mud couplets in the bottom of the upper unit of this\nformation, with muddy layers commonly disrupted (Fig. 8),\nindicate inteftidal to subtidal environments (cf. Visser 1980,\nTillman 1985) and suggest the action of wave-reworking\nprocesses or even the overload of thick sandstone layers being\ndeposited. The grain size, the parallel lamination, the dis-\nrupted muddy layers, and some parallel cross stratifications\nof the Palmares sandstones compare with the cross-bedded\nsandstone facies deposited above the tidal current base, where\nstronger currents do exist (cf. Walker 1985). Parallel-lami-\nnate, fine-grained siliciclastics such as the Jacare metasiltites\nand Frei Paulo variegated phyllites may be interpreted as distal\nsediments deposited below the storm-wave base, with even-\ntual contribution of turbiditic tongues to form the sandy\nlenses. The assemblage of Frei Paulo quartz-sericite-chlorite\nphyllites, metagreywackes, metarhythmites and metavol-\ncanics is very similar to those commonly found in distal,\nrestricted, and relatively deeper-water environments associ-\nated with volcanism, e.g. in the Mesoproterozoic of Canada\n(cf. Wardle and Bailey 1981) and also in the Riacho do Pontal\nFold Belt (Fig. 1, Gomes 1990). The lithofacies of interbedded\nmetacarbonates and pebbly metagreywackes, already de-\nscribed in other Neoproterozoic areas (Miller 1983), has also\nbeen recognised in Cretaceous deep waters of North America\n(Sliler et al. 1991).\n\nDiamictites Although these rocks may be formed by\nmeltwaters, glaciogenic processes, debris and mud flows\n(Eyles and Mial 1984), commonly the clasts suply is mostly\ninduced by extensional tectonic processes in all sedimentary\nenvironments (Eyles 1993). The Ribeir\u00f3polis and Palestina\npebbly phyllites and diamictites most probably indicate\ntect\u00f4nically and gravity-induced mass flows operating in the\nbasin, in agreement with earlier suggestions by Humphrey and\nAllard (1969). Evidence are the thickness variation, the nature\nand the size of some clasts locally observed close to regional\nfaults. Negative evidence are the lack of glaciation-related\nclasts, striated pavements, and extra-basinal clasts in the study\narea.\n\nCarbonates The Jacoca and Olhos D'\u00e1gua carbonates\ncompare with shallowing-up sequences typical of most of the\nProterozoic platforms (cf. Grotzinger 1989). These sequences\nnormally have basah offshore shelf facies (parallel-laminated\nand thinly intercalated carbonate and fine siliciclastics or\ndistal turbidites), and pass into subtidal-intertidal facies,\nwhere oolites, intraclasts and wave-reworked structures\nrecording a more agitated environment (e.g. Herrington and\nFairchild 1989). Similarly, both carbonate formations in the\nItabaiana dome area pass to rhythmites comparable to the\nlimestone rhythmite facies commonly developed along ramps\nleading to relatively deeper environments (cf. Hoffman 1974,\nMarkello and Read 1981).\n\nPaleogeography and syn-depositional tectonics\nSeveral data from the literature of the Sergipano Belt (sum-\nmary in D'el-Rey Silva 1992) indicate that the Sergipano\n\nFigure 11 - Stratigraphic framework showing the craton-miogeoclinal lithological continuity and the summary megasequence\nstratigraphy for the southern part of the Sergipano Belt.

To\nthe west of the Tucano basin (Fig.2), the sediments deposited\nin the cratonic environment are less than a few 100'm-thick\nand consist of local Juete conglomerates and Acaua carbon-\nates, which directly overlap the craton basement. The sedi-\nments deposited in the basin are siliciclastic and belong to the\nFrei Paulo and Palestina Formations. To the east of the Tucano\nbasin, the cratonic sediments are generally =1-3km thick\n(Silva Filho 1982, Saes 1984) whereas in the basin total\nthicknesses is ?4km around the Itabaiana dome (Davison and\nSantos 1989, D'el-Rey Silva 1992).\n\nWide variation of lithofacies and thicknesses associated\nwith regional faults, as in the Sergipano basin, have been\ndescribed and interpreted as well-documented examples of\nsedimentary infilling under a syn-depositional extensional\nregime (e.g. Mitchell and Owens 1990, Collier 1991). Actu-\nally, the abundant evidence for tect\u00f4nically controlled sedi-\nmentation up to the deposition of the third megasequence (Fig.\n10) allows to interpret most of the regional thrust faults in the\nsouthern part of the Sergipano Belt as positively inverted\nnormal faults (Fig. 3). The data also strongly suggest that the\nItabaiana and Sim\u00e3o dias basement domes started to evolve as\npaleohighs, and the area between the Escarpa and Pelada faults\nevolved into a fault-bounded, long-lived and relatively deeper\ntrough during basin evolution (the Vaza B arris trough of\nD'el-Rey Silva 1992) which extends up to 300km, to the west\nof the Itabaiana dome, in an otherwise shallow water basin.\nThe trough may have stretched also to the east, in the direction\nof the present Atlantic ocean.\n\nIn fact, all the formations are much thinner (0-100m)\naround the Sim\u00e3o Dias dome, exception for the Olhos D'\u00e1gua\ncarbonates, and around the Itabaiana dome, exception for the\nItabaiana quartzites. On the contrary, the greatest accumula-\ntions of finer siliciclastics (?500m) is recorded between the\nEscarpa and Pelada faults, as well as to the north of the\nMocambo fault (Fig. 3). One could argue for tectonic thinning\nof the siliciclastic sediments above the Itabaiana quartzites,\ninstead of a stratigraphic thinning towards the domes. How-\never, the fact that the Ribeir\u00f3polis Formation is actually\nmissing somewhere around the Itabaiana dome, without evi-\ndence of tectonism in the contact Itabaiana-Jacoca formations,\ntogether with preservation of primary structures in the basal\ncontacts of the Itabaiana and Ribeiropolis formations, around\nboth the domes, does not recommend the tectonic interpreta-\ntion, although it may have had some participation, enhancing\nthe thickness contrast.\n\nThe Miaba Group The (Juet\u00ea-)Itabaiana Formation\nchanges from the muddy and conglomeratic basal lithofacies,\nup to the ?30m thick on the craton and regionally, even around\nthe two domes, to well-washed quartzites up to 200m-thick,\nin the southern part of the Itabaiana dome, reaching ?750m to\nthe west and east of it. This change happens across the trace\nof the Sim\u00e3o Dias and Itaporanga faults, and strongly suggests\nthat the site of the future Itabaiana dome evolved into a deeper\ndepocenter which captured most of the sediment supply.\nRibeiropolis volcanics occur in the western side of the Sim\u00e3o\nDias dome, whereas conglomeratic lithofacies occur locally\n\nFigure 12 - Cartoon to illustrate the preferred mode of the continental extension that led to the Neoproterozoic Sergipano basin\nand to the northern margin of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton. From D'el-Rey Silva (1992). See text.\nFigura 12 - Modelo esquem\u00e1tico da extens\u00e3o continental que resultou na bacia Sergipana, no Neoproteroz\u00f3ico, ao longo da margem norte do Cr\u00e1ton do S\u00e3o Francisco.\n\n199\n\n\n\nRevista Brasileira de GeociSncias, Volume 25,1995\n\nin the eastern and western sides of the Itabaiana dome\n(Ribeir\u00f3polis diamictites displaying ?1.2m size clasts of\nbasement rocks were found close to the Mocambo fault and\nto the Itabaiana dome by Humphrey and Allard 1969). The\nthicker Jacoca carbonates die to the west and northwest of the\nItabaiana dome and become increasingly siliciclastic towards\nthe Vaza Barris trough, and to the north of the Mocambo fault.\n\nThe Sim\u00e3o Dias Group By that time the basin\nreceived thicker and relatively deep water sediments of the\nFrei Paulo Formation to the west and to the east of the\nItabaiana dome, whereas sandstone lenses are recorded within\nthe phyllites, particularly to the north of the trough (Fig. 3).\n\nThe Vaza Barris Group The Vaza Barris trough\nrecords the thickest section of the Palestina diamictites, and\nalso records the gradual passage from Olhos D'\u00e1gua\ncarbonates into carbonate metarhythmites, across the trace of\nthe Escarpa fault (section AA' , Fig. 5).\n\nContinental margin extensional model We prefer\na simple shear style of crustal extension (cf. Wernicke and\nBurchfiel 1982) for the opening of the Sergipano basin above\na linked listric detachment (cf. Gibbs 1984). Extension of the\nnorthern margin of the Sao Francisco Craton was probably\noblique (Fig. 12; cf. Gibbs 1987). The basin probably evolved\nfrom an initially intracratonic setting into an oceanic basin.\nSuch interpretation is supported by the island-arc geochemical\nsignature of the basic-ultrabasic magmatism of the Caninde\ndomain and by deposition of the Palestina diamictites in a\n?300km long trench that indicate an important event of crustal\nextension (the Vaza Barris trough of D'el-Rey Silva 1992,\n1995b). In such a model, upper crust extension would take\nplace above a ramp-flat listric basal detachment, and the\ncumulative strain of the extending hangingwall was accom-\nmodated by a system of synthetic and antithetic, planar and\nlistric normal faults.\n\nThe listric fault model is favoured because: a - the basin\nmust have been asymmetric; b - thicknesses generally increase\nto the north, away from the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton; c - the\nPalestina diamictites are deposited in a long lived trough; d -\nextensional fault activity is indicated by the presence of large\npolylithic clasts of both basement and cover sediments in the\nsuccession adjacent to the Sim\u00e3o Dias and Mocambo faults,\npointing out to uplift-erosion of footwall and possibly hang-\ningwall blocks twice during the evolution of the basin; and e\n- the lack of multiple wedge shaped sedimentary sequences\nwithin the succession. These would be produced if extension\nin the basin margin dominantly occurred by an array of\ndomino style faults (e.g. Davison 1989), or even in a flexural-\ncantilever model (cf. Kusznir et al. 1991).\n\nTECTONIC IMPLICATIONS FOR THE BELT AND\nTHE SAO FRANCISCO CRATON The stratigraphic\nanalysis here presented rules out thrust belt-foreland basin\nmodels to explain the origin of the Palmares sandstones and\nlithic wackes, an interpretation initially adopted in the pre-\nvious literature of the Sergipano Belt, as in the Introduction\nof this paper. In addition to the large amount of new data\npointing out to another origin for the Lagarto-Palmares For-\nmation, the sedimentary characteristics of the Palmares sand-\nstones and wackes do not compare either with continental\nsedimentation described elsewhere ahead of thrust sheets (e.g.\nGustavson 1974, Nichols 1987) or ahead fault-uplifted terra-\nnes (e.g. Wescott and Ethridge 1990). Similarly, the strati-\ngraphic succession formed by the Sim\u00e3o Dias and Vaza Barris\ngroups does not compare with the marine sedimentation de-\n\nveloped in foreland basins due to accretion of terranes into a\npassive margin, as interpreted for example in the evolution of\nthe Appalachians and Cordilleran basins of North America\n(Tankard 1986).\n\nBecause the Sergipano Belt has unique and key evidence\naround the basement domes, and because its cratonic-miogeo-\ncline-eugeocline lithostructural continuity is a common fea-\nture in many other Neoproterozoic fold belts, in particular\naround the Sao Francisco Craton (e.g. Egydio da Silva et al.\n1989, Gomes 1990, Uhlein et al. 1990, Pedrosa-Soares et al\n1992, Farias 1995), caution is required in applying thrust\nbelt-foreland basin models to explain the upper section of the\ncratonic cover related to the Riacho do Pontal, Rio Preto,\nBrasilia and Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed Belts (Fig. 1). Instead, the voluminous\nsands of the upper section of the Est\u00e2ncia domain in the\nSergipano Belt (the Palmares massive sandstones) must have\ncome from southern sources in the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton, once\nthe detailed sedimentary analysis done by Saes (1984) within\nhis Lagarto and Palmares formations does not support a\nnorthern source.\n\nCONCLUSIONS Tect\u00f4nically controlled sedimenta-\ntion resulted in the deposition of a _1-4km thick miogeoclinal\nwedge of carbonates and siliciclastics in the southern part of\nan asymmetric basin that afterwards evolved into an ocenic\nbasin, the closure of which formed the Sergipano Belt in the\nnorthern margin of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton. The\nstratigraphic record of the southern part of the belt is divided\nin the Estancia-Miaba, Sim\u00e3o Dias and Vaza Barris groups.\nThese groups correlate laterally with the Macurur\u00e9 Group of\nthe northern part of the belt and comprise ten formations\ninterpreted as part of two sedimentary cycles and four\nmegasequences which accounts for the spatial distribution of\nlithofacies, thickness and sedimentary processes throughout\nthe basin.\n\nA new tectonic-sedimentary entity in the Sergipano Belt\n(the Sim\u00e3o Dias Group and the Upper Siliciclastic Megase-\nquence as a whole), most likely resulted from a uplift and\nerosion of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton and also from basement\nblocks uplifted to the N of the Itabaiana dome area, implying\nthat massive sandstones overlying the cratonic sedimentary\ncover (the Palmares sandstones) are not the product of the\nerosion of a deforming Sergipano Belt. The similarities of the\nsedimentary record, the craton-belt lithostructural continuity\nand the megasequence stratigraphy of the Sergipano Belt\ncompare well with other Neoproterozoic cratonic margins,\npointing out to a probable common tectonic evolution for the\nNeoproterozoic cratons, basins and belts. This issue is to be\nadressed in more detail in a future publication where basin\nevolution is further discussed, together with the origin of the\nSim\u00e3o Dias Group and its implication for the evolution of the\nS\u00e3o Francisco Craton and peripheral Neoproterozoic basins.\n\nAcknowledgments L.J.H.
