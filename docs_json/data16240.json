The main objective of \n\npresent work is to relate this water-quality condition with parameters taken from the transient \n\nsounding\u2019s data. \n\n \n\nIn this context, transient soundings have been acquired from 2005 through 2009, at several \n\nchosen valleys near the sea, in a mean rate of one field campaign each year. \n\n \n\nThe first phase of this work was the understanding of the geophysical method details, \n\nproblems and applicability, as the chosen and acquired equipment was the first one to be \n\npermanently available to the Portuguese geosciences community. This first phase was also \n\naccomplished with field tests. \n\n \n\nInterpretation of the transient sounding\u2019s data curves were done by application of 1-D \n\ninversion methods already developed and published, as also with quasi 2-D and quasi 3-D \n\ninversion algorithms, where applicability was feasible. This was the second phase. The 2-D \n\nand 3-D approximation results are satisfactory and promising; although a higher spatial \n\nsounding\u2019s density should certainly allow for better results. \n\n \n\nAt phase three, these results have been compared against the available lithologic, hydrologic \n\nand hydrochemical data, in the context of Santiago\u2019s island settings. The analyses of these \n\nmerged data showed that two distinct origins for the observed inland groundwater salinity are \n\npossible; seashore shallow mixing with contemporary seawater and mixing with a deep and \n\nolder salty layer from up flow groundwater. Relations between the electric resistivity and the \n\nsalt water content distribution were found for the surveyed areas. \n\n \n\nTo this environment condition, the electromagnetic transient method proved to be a reliable \n\nand powerful technique. The groundwater quality can be accessed beyond the few available \n\nwatershed points, which have an uneven distribution. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords: TEM, Salt water, Hydrologic relations, Santiago Island (Cape Verde) \n  \n\n\n\nABSTRACT \n__________ \n\n VIII\n\n \n\n\n\nIX \n\nRESUMO \n\n \n \nEste trabalho tem como finalidade a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o do m\u00e9todo de prospec\u00e7\u00e3o geof\u00edsica no \ndom\u00ednio electromagn\u00e9tico, conhecido como Transiente, em regi\u00f5es \u00e1ridas e semi-\u00e1ridas da \nilha de Santiago \u2013 Cabo Verde. Algumas \u00e1reas costeiras desta ilha apresentam um aumento \nde salinidade na sua \u00e1gua subterr\u00e2nea, que se vem agravando no tempo. O principal \nobjectivo do presente trabalho \u00e9 relacionar a condi\u00e7\u00e3o de qualidade desta \u00e1gua subterr\u00e2nea \ncom os par\u00e2metros adquiridos a partir dos dados das sondagens electromagn\u00e9ticas \ntransientes. \n \nNeste contexto, foram efectuadas sondagens electromagn\u00e9ticas transientes entre os anos \nde 2005 e 2009, em alguns vales costeiros da ilha, \u00e0 raz\u00e3o m\u00e9dia de uma campanha de \ntrabalho de campo por ano. \n \nA primeira fase deste trabalho foi a compreens\u00e3o dos detalhes do m\u00e9todo geof\u00edsico em \ncausa, tal como a sua aplicabilidade e suas limita\u00e7\u00f5es, uma vez que este tipo de m\u00e9todo e o \nequipamento escolhido foi o primeiro a estar permanentemente dispon\u00edvel para a \ncomunidade portuguesa de geoci\u00eancias. Esta primeira fase foi tamb\u00e9m acompanhada com a \nrealiza\u00e7\u00e3o de testes de campo. \n \nA Interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o dos dados das sondagens transientes foi efectuada atrav\u00e9s da aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de \nm\u00e9todos de invers\u00e3o 1D j\u00e1 desenvolvidos e publicados, e tamb\u00e9m com algoritmos de \ninvers\u00e3o quasi-2D e quasi-3D, sempre que poss\u00edvel. Esta foi a segunda fase do trabalho. Os \nresultados das aproxima\u00e7\u00f5es quasi-2D e quasi-3D s\u00e3o satisfat\u00f3rios e promissores, embora \nse verifique que uma maior densidade especial de sondagens transientes trar\u00e1 e certamente \npermitir\u00e1 melhores resultados. \n \nNa fase tr\u00eas, estes resultados foram comparados com os dados litol\u00f3gicos, hidrol\u00f3gicos e \nhidroqu\u00edmicos dispon\u00edveis, no contexto das condi\u00e7\u00f5es da ilha de Santiago. As an\u00e1lises \nconjuntas destes dados mostram que devem existir duas origens distintas para a salinidade \nobservada nas \u00e1guas subterr\u00e2neas das zonas costeiras; uma mistura com a \u00e1gua actual do \nmar nas zonas sub-superficiais perto do mar, e uma mistura com uma mais profunda e \nantiga \u00e1gua ascendente que atravessa uma camada com maior conte\u00fado salino. Foram \nestabelecidas rela\u00e7\u00f5es entre a resistividade el\u00e9ctrica e a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de conte\u00fado salino da \n\u00e1gua para as regi\u00f5es pesquisadas. \n \nNestas condi\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais, o presente m\u00e9todo electromagn\u00e9tico transiente provou ser \numa t\u00e9cnica fi\u00e1vel e de f\u00e1cil aplicabilidade. A qualidade das \u00e1guas subterr\u00e2neas pode assim \nser inferida indirectamente, mesmo em \u00e1reas no qual n\u00e3o existam po\u00e7os ou furos de \ncapta\u00e7\u00e3o com distribui\u00e7\u00e3o uniforme nos vales. \n \n \nKeywords: TEM, \u00c1gua salgada, Rela\u00e7\u00f5es hidrol\u00f3gicas, Ilha de Santiago (Cabo Verde) \n  \n\n\n\nRESUMO \n________ \n\n X\n\n \n\n\n\nXI \n\nLIST OF FIGURES \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 2 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 - The basic measuring principles of the TEM method, with theoretical current (blue \n\nline) and real current (red line) over time.

By consequence of human activities, water\u2019s quality is \n\naccordingly getting depleted, with very adverse effects over populations, ecosystems and \n\neconomy. The knowledge and control of water quantity and quality is vital and fundamental \n\nto the planning and management of this priceless resource to Earth life and health. This is \n\neven more difficult to achieve when groundwater is concerned. To probe the quantity and \n\nespecially the quality of groundwater, specific actions have to be made, and some \n\nbackground conditions are mandatory, other than a simple superficial water sampling for \n\nphysical-chemical (or biological) analyses. The traditional direct method, i.e. in-situ \n\nmeasurement of water\u2019s electric conductivity or water sampling is only possible if springs, \n\nwells and boreholes do exist in the field. Nevertheless, the information will be limited to those \n\nsampling spots. The number of these sampling places is for most of the situations very \n\nlimited. To overcome this, indirect methods can be very useful, like the geophysical methods \n\nhave prove since the beginning of last century. \n\n \n\nThe present thesis deals with the applicability of one method, between many geophysical \n\nelectromagnetic prospection methods, known as Transient Method to the characterization of \n\ngroundwater reservoirs. It was applied to the particular problem of groundwater quality \n\nassessment at Santiago Island \u2013 Cape Verde Republic. The work was done under the scope \n\nof FCT project HYDROARID \u2013 \u201cEvaluation of the hydrological potential and seawater \n\nintrusion monitoring at semi-arid regions, by a multidisciplinary approach. Application to the \n\nislands of Santiago and Maio (Cabo Verde)\u201d, POCI/CTE/GEX/55399/2004. Briefly the thesis \n\nis organized in nine chapters, including this first one devoted to a general introduction. \n\n \n\nChapter 2 describes the physical electromagnetic principles behind the transient \n\nelectromagnetic method. The signal problems and special effects over it are also included, \n\ntogether with the equipment description at field work. \n\n \n\nChapter 3 describes the transient electromagnetic modelling theory, with description and \n\ntesting of the several different methods to invert measured data and obtain a useful physical \n\nmodel. \n\n \n\nChapter 4 describes the field work test to the equipment used thereafter, with comparison to \n\nother geophysical data acquired with different methods over the same location. \n\n \n\nChapter 5 describes the electrical/hydrogeological relationships that can be established \n\nbetween the transient electromagnetic modelled data and some useful hydrogeological \n\nparameters of groundwater quality. \n\n \n\nChapter 6 includes the most important Santiago Island settings, with geological and \n\nclimatological description, as also the most-recent hydrochemical and isotopic available data. \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n______________ \n\n 2\n\n \n\nChapter 7 describes the transient electromagnetic method (TEM) surveys at Santiago Island, \n\nas also the interpretation of data by several different methods, and its relation with the \n\nobserved groundwater chemistry. Assessment to groundwater salinity is advanced. \n\n \n\nChapter 8 describes the interpretation of the results and observed changes on the transient \n\nelectromagnetic repetition surveys. \n\n \n\nIn the chapter 9, the conclusions and recommendations are described. \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n2 \nTEM METHOD \n\n \n\nThe purpose of this second chapter is to give an introduction to the Transient \n\nElectromagnetic Method (TEM). The basic principles of the method, used equipment and \n\nsources of errors will be also presented here. Special effects like Induced Polarization and \n\nSuperparamagnetic effect are discussed also. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.1 \u2013 Electromagnetic methods \n \n\nElectromagnetic (EM) geophysical exploration method is one of the many tools now available \n\nand applied to obtain information about the subsurface of the Earth. There is an EM variety \n\nof techniques, survey methods, applications and interpretation procedures. All of them, \n\nhowever, involve the measurement of one or more electric and/or magnetic-field component \n\nby an EM Receiver, from some natural or man-made Controlled Source ElectroMagnetic \n\n(CSEM) energy source - the EM Transmitter. Examples of techniques using natural EM field \n\npropagation at the Earth are Magnetotelluric (MT) and Spontaneous Potential (SP). One \n\nclassification of the several techniques is given at table 2.1. Table\u2019s first entry, is the \n\nresistivity method, also known as direct current (DC). This fundamental and well establish \n\nEM method was the first one to be successfully applied to earth interior\u2019s study, at the XX \n\ncentury. It is a subset of the EM methods, which arise when zero frequency (continuous \n\ncurrent - DC) are applied by the transmitter. \n\n \n\nElectromagnetic methods are based and ruled by Maxwell\u2019s laws. An alternating current EM \n\nsource induces always a secondary current in conductive earth materials. These secondary \n\ncurrents then generate secondary magnetic fields. EM receivers measure this secondary \n\nfield, and sometimes, also the primary (initial) source field. The relation between the primary \n\nand secondary fields is just the way earth reacts to the applied stimulus \u2013 \u201cthe transfer \n\nfunction of the Earth\u201d. Proprieties of the earth\u2019s interior are interpreted from these transfer \n\nfunctions, being electrical resistivity (or electrical conductivity, EC) one of the most-used \n\npropriety. \n\n \n\nThe success and evolution of EM methods stand from the wide range of available targets, \n\nand the almost any scale applicability of it; starting from the small natural sample at the \n\nlaboratory to regional and global distribution of anomalously conductive mantle. However the \n\n\u201cdriven force\u201d behind the EM method was the mineral exploration surveys, because most \n\nbase metal massive sulfides ores are very conductive, providing a strong contrast to their \n\nhost rocks. This exploration began in the 1950-60 period, with the advent of airborne \n\nsystems. For long time, it was the prime application of EM methods. In the last century 70\u2019, \n\nthe application of EM to other targets, besides traditional mineral exploration, together with a \n\ngrowing development of EM exploration equipment, gave the possibility to search, for \n\ninstance, the conductive influx seawater into a resistive aquifer (Auken et al., 2006, Swift, \n\n1988). \n\n \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 4\n\nNot included on Table 2.1 is the GPR (Ground-Penetrating Radar) technique. It is a relatively \n\nnew tool, with typically a two twin antenna system, one being the EM Transmitter and the \n\nother one being the EM Receiver. The EM frequency ranges from 50 MHz to the 1-2 GHz, \n\nallowing a high resolution and detail at the near surface, with a small size and portable \n\nequipment. This EM technique output is similar to seismic method, and many working tools \n\nare just adapted from the latter. The major difference, to exclude GPR from Table 2.1, is the \n\napplied frequency domain. At these high frequencies, EM earth material\u2019s behaviour is very \n\ndifferent from the diffusive techniques included on Table 2.1. \n\n \n\nTable 2.1 \u2013 Electrical and electromagnetic systems classification (adapted from Swift (1988)). \n\nEM Transmitter EM Receiver \n\ngrounded wire grounded wire wire and small \n\ncoil \n\nsmall coil \n\n(ground) \n\nsmall coil \n\n(air) \n\nGalvanic Resistivity, IP  Magnetometric \n\nresistivity (MMR), \n\nMagnetic IP (MIP) \n\n \n\nInductive Eltran Controlled \n\nsource AMT \n\n(CSAMT) \n\nSome TEM \n\nsystems \n\n \n\nSmall loop   Slingram, \n\nHorizontal loop \n\nEM, Vertical loop \n\nEM, Tilt angle \n\nmethod, Some \n\nTEM systems \n\ncoincident loop, \n\nBorehole \n\nconfigurations \n\nAirborne EM; \n\nTime domain \n\ntowed-bird, \n\nHelicopter \n\nrigid-boom \n\nLarge loop \n\n(long wire) \n\n  Large loop \n\nsystems Turam, \n\nmany TEM \n\nsystems, Borehole \n\nconfigurations \n\n \n\nPlane Wave     \n\nVertical antenna  VLF-Resistivity VLF VLF \n\nNatural \n\ngeomagnetic \n\nfield \n\nTelluric \n\ncurrents SP \n\nMagnetotellurics   \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2 \u2013 The TEM method \n \n\nElectromagnetic methods are divided into two categories: Frequency Domain methods \n\n(FDEM) and Time Domain methods (TDEM). Only this latter one will be described here. \n\n \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 5\n\nTransient Electromagnetic Method is a time-domain method which was originally designed in \n\nthe seventies of last century, as a way of finding ore deposits, mainly sulfides. At Portugal, it \n\nwas and still is applied throughout the Iberian pyritic main belt with that purpose. It is an \n\ninductive method, and its ability to find low-resistivity layers has also made it one of the \n\npreferred methods for locating the bottom of aquifers, in the last decades. Nowadays, it is \n\nbecoming very popular for hydrogeological mapping, replacing the traditional DC resistivity \n\nmethod, to some extent, by its easy application and less man power, being cheaper than DC \n\nmethod. It is best suited to groundwater prospecting at arid and hard-rock environments. \n\nHowever there are some natural limitations, inherent to the method. For instance, according \n\nto J\u00f8rgensen et al. (2003), layers with resistivity higher than 80-120 ?.m cannot be expected \n\nto be mapped correctly if they are surrounded by layers with a lower resistivity value. \n\n \n\nAt present, TEM is under continuous development, which has resulted in the development of \n\nsystems like the airborne SkyTEM method, the continuous TEM method (PATEM) and the \n\nhigh moment TEM method (HMTEM or HiTEM). (Danielsen et al., 2001 and 2003). \n\nReference texts and descriptions for geological exploration and environmental investigation \n\nproblems; such as mineral, groundwater and geothermal explorations, engineering geology \n\nand applied environmental geophysics investigations can be found at (Fittermann and \n\nStewart, 1986; Buselli et al., 1990; Hoekstra and Blohm, 1990; Nabighian and Macnae, 1991; \n\nZhdanov and Keller, 1994; Christensen and Sorensen, 1998). \n\n \n\nAs described the TEM is part of the Time Domain Electromagnetic Method geophysical \n\nprospection technique, contrary to the Frequency Domain Electromagnetic Method. Time \n\nDomain methods use a direct current, usually passed through an ungrounded loop laying \n\ndown at earth\u2019s surface. Applying a continuous current to a coil creates a magnetic field, \n\nwhich is stable after some time. Stopping this current originates a variable magnetic field, \n\nwhich intensity decreases rapidly. The changing magnetic field induces currents in the \n\nground. \n\n \n\nPrevious reviews of CSEM studies, including TEM method, for near-surface applications \n\nhave been carried out by Nobes (1996) and Tezkan (1999). Tutorial articles specifically \n\nconcerned with the CSEM method have been written by McNeill (1980 a, b) and West and \n\nMacnae (1991), while deeper theoretical treatments are available in the books by Grant and \n\nWest (1965), Ward and Hohmann (1987), Wait (1982), Nabighian (1989) and Zhdanov and \n\nKeller (1994). Introduction level exploration textbooks such as Telford et al. (1990), Sharma \n\n(1997) and Kearey et al. (2002) provide just a brief overview of the CSEM method, along with \n\nsome case studies. \n\n \n\nAt figure 2.1, the nomenclature and basic principles behind this method are summarized. \n\nDepicted theoretical waveform is called square wave (blue line). Red line represents the real \n\ncurrent signal in the transmitter loop. The EM transmitter repeats this on-time \u2013 off-time \n\ncycles for a few minutes, to grab and enhance the registered signal. Each cycle last typically \n\na couple of seconds. \n\n \n\nAfter the initial continuous field has stabilized, the current is turned off very rapidly (thus the \n\nterm transient EM) and this induces a primary magnetic field, which is proportional to the \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 6\n\neffective area of the loop and the current amount. The current can be turned off in several \n\nways, and for theoretical studies, the turn-off ramp can even be a true \u2018step-off\u2019 response \n\n(blue line at figure 2.1). Just after the current is turned off, eddy (ring smoke like) currents are \n\ninstantly generated near the transmitting wire, as a reaction to maintain the magnetic field. \n\nWith the passage of time these horizontal currents diffuse down and outward (figure 2.2). As \n\na result of the finite electrical conductivity of the ground (and also nearby targets) these \n\ncurrent\u2019s decay with time. The decay of the currents induces a secondary magnetic field, \n\nwhich is only dependent on the electric conductivity of the ground (and nearby targets), and \n\ncan be measured by an induction receiver coil or loop (McNeill, 1990). Ideally, the primary \n\nfield is absent while measuring earth\u2019s response. \n\n \n\nThe data is usually recorded in time windows (often called time gates) with increasing \n\ninterval time length. That improves the signal to noise ratio (SNR) at late times, were the \n\nsignals are weak. This recording happens at the off-time part of the cycle, following the turn-\n\noff instant (zero time for the time gates counting). The current direction\u2019s shift due to the \n\nunwanted signal from power lines if the repetition frequency is chosen as a multiple of a sub \n\nharmonic of the usual 50 Hz (or 60 Hz) power line frequency. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 - The basic measuring principles of the TEM method, with theoretical current (blue line) and \n\nreal current (red line) over time. This is for a central (in loop) system. The relative lengths of the \n\nturn-on ramp and the turn off-ramp are not to scale, (adapted from Christiansen (2003)). \n\n \n\nThe common TEM system used in environmental studies consists of a transmitter and a \n\nreceiver unit. The transmitter unit is usually a large square loop made of standard flexible \n\nelectrical cable with a side length varying between 10-20 and 100-150 meters. The current \n\nsignal applied to the transmitter loop can be high as 30 ampere, but typically is about a few \n\nampere in a 50 m \u00d7 50 meter single-turn square loop transmitter. The receiver is usually a \n\nrigid multi-turn coil with a diameter between a half and one meter, with an effective area of \n\naround 40-50 m\n2\n. Alternatively, the same transmitter loop cable can also be used as the \n\nreceiver loop, one of the configurations at figure 2.3. The receiver can be placed either inside \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 7\n\nthe transmitter (central-loop or in-loop configuration) or outside the transmitter (offset \n\nconfiguration). For most ground TEM systems, only the vertical component of the secondary \n\nfield is measured in a central loop configuration, but in recent years steps have been taken to \n\nuse other configurations, and with receiver coils, all three components of the field can be \n\nused to gain information about the conductivity of the underground. For airborne systems, an \n\noffset configuration is used, and all three components of the field are recorded. \n\nFigure 2.2 - The flow of TEM eddy current below the transmitter at successive times, \n\nfrom early times (t1, t2) to late times (t5,\u2026). \n\nFigure 2.3 \u2013 Some usual field Tx-Rx configurations for TEM surveys, \n\n(adapted from Nabighian and Macnae (1991)). \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 8\n\n \n\n \n\n2.3 \u2013 The Physics of the TEM method \n \n\nThe following description is a short overview of the electromagnetic theory behind the TEM \n\nmethod. The applied notation is as follows: lowercase-letters concern to functions expressed \n\nover time domain, and upper case-letters to functions expressed in the frequency domain \n\n(Harrington 1961). Where possible, the presentation of the relevant equations is kept in the \n\ntime domain, although some arguments require equations stated in the frequency domain. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.1 \u2013 Maxwell Equations and constitutive relations \n \n\nThe physics behind all electromagnetic phenomena is contained in the Maxwell Equations, \n\nwhich are first-order linear differential equations. Those equations are uncoupled, but they \n\ncan be coupled by empirical constitutive relations, which reduce the amount of basic vector \n\nfield functions from five to just two. Maxwell Equations are empirical equations based on \n\nexperimental data and observations, performed, for instance, by Faraday and Ampere (Ward \n\nand Hohmann, 1988). All known electromagnetic phenomena obey to these equations, \n\ndescribed in the time domain as; \n\n \n\n     ? \u00b7 dddd ? ?     (2.1a) \n \n\n     ? \u00b7 bbbb ? 0     (2.1b) \n \n\n     ? ? eeee \n ???\n ? 0     (2.1c) \n \n\n     ? ? hhhh ? ???\n ? ?     (2.1d) \n \n\nin which e is the electric field vector [V.m\n-1\n], \n\nb is the magnetic induction vector [Wb.m\n-2\n], \n\nh is the magnetic field vector [A.m\n-1\n], \n\nj is the electric conductive current density vector [A.m\n-2\n], \n\nd is the dielectric displacement current vector [C.m\n-2\n] \n\nand ? is the electric charge density [C.m\n-3\n]. \n\n \n\nMaxwell\u2019s equation (2.1c) is the Faraday\u2019s Law, which states that a changing over time \n\nmagnetic field generates an electric field. This electric field is perpendicular to the magnetic \n\ninduced field. Equation (2.1d) is known as modified Ampere\u2019s Law, which states that \n\nmagnetic fields are perpendicular to the electrical current and that the total current is the sum \n\nof the conductive current and the displacement current. The remaining two equations are \n\nboth the laws of Gauss, describing the electric displacement (2.1a) and magnetic induction \n\n(2.1b). The later states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero. That means a \n\nsolenoid geometry field and ultimately that magnetic mono-poles do not exist. The former \n\nequation states that the divergence of the displacement current is equal to the electric charge \n\ndensity. \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 9\n\nThe usual way to solve this boundary-value problem is by field vector functions conversion to \n\nthe scalar potential functions must. \n\n \n\nThese Maxwell\u2019s Equations (2.1a to 2.1d), are coupled through the following constitutive \n\nrelations, in the frequency-domain. They are; \n\n \n\n    ? ? ????,EEEE,rrrr,t,T,P,\u2026?EEEE     (2.2a) \n \n\n    ? ? ????,HHHH,rrrr,t,T,P,\u2026?HHHH     (2.2b) \n \n\n    ! ? \"???,EEEE,rrrr,t,T,P,\u2026?EEEE     (2.2c) \n \n\nwhere ??, ?? and \"? are tensors describing, respectively, the dielectric permittivity, the magnetic \npermittivity and the electric conductivity, as a function of ? (angular frequency), E (electric \n\nfield), r (position vector), t (time), T (temperature) and P (pressure), These tensors are \n\ncomplex (in the general case), meaning that phases of D and E, of H and B and of J and E \n\nare different (Ward and Hohmann, 1988). \n\n \n\nTogether with these two sets of expressions (2.1 and 2.2), the physic\u2019s fundamental equation \n\nof charge conservation is always present: \n\n \n\n     \n&amp;'\n&amp;( \n ? ) ? ? 0     (2.3) \n\n \n\nFor homogeneous earth materials with electric conductivities equal or greater than 10\n-4\n S.m\n\n-1\n, \n\nfree electric charge dissipates in less than 10\n-6\n\n s (Stratton, 1941). Thus for the stand of view \n\nof geophysical prospecting, in which frequencies less than 10\n5\n Hz are employed, the first \n\nterm of the left-hand side of equation (2.3) vanish, remaining just: \n\n \n\n     ? ) ? ? 0     (2.4) \n \n\nThis equation (2.4) does not hold true at inhomogeneous regions, for instance, at the \n\ninterface between two different media a surface charge does accumulate. \n\n \n\nAt most of the electromagnetic earth problems, and to simplify the analysis, a number of \n\nassumptions are made: \n\n \n\n- All media are considered linear, isotropic, homogeneous, and electrical properties \n\nare taken independent of time, temperature or pressure, \n\n- The magnetic permeability \u00b5 is assumed to be that of free space, \u00b5 = \u00b50 \n\n(that couldn\u2019t be the case over some eruptive formations). \n\n \n\nAt some conditions, anisotropic media must be necessarily considered to aid in interpretation \n\nof observed data. At deep crustal surveys, temperature and pressure are also taken into \n\naccount. Furthermore, in shallow geotechnical surveys, the time dependence of electric \n\nconductivity due to changes in soil moisture cannot always be neglected.  \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 10\n\nIn the following considerations and derived relations, the simplification of the set of three \n\nexpressions (2.2) in the time domain will suffice. The relations are restricted to non-\n\ndispersive media where ?, \u00b5 and ? are time independent. \n\n \n\n     * ? ????eeee      (2.5a) \n \n\n     , ? \u00b5\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5hhhh      (2.5b) \n \n\n     ? ? ????eeee      (2.5c) \n \n\nThe last relation (2.5c) is the very well known Ohm\u2019s law, connecting the prevailing \n\nconductive electric current to the applied electric field, over a conductive body. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.2 \u2013The Electromagnetic Wave Equations \n \n\nThe wave equations describe the wave properties of electric and magnetic fields as they \n\ntravel across any conductive media.

Physically \n\n(2.7) equation\u2019s terms are as follows; the second term is the energy storage term, describing \n\nwave propagation (Powers, 1997). The third one is the energy dissipation term describing \n\nelectromagnetic diffusion. As stated before, most CSEM methods operate at low frequencies \n\n(100 Hz to 1 MHz range), alternatively, slow time disturbances of the source current (?1 \u00b5s \nto 10 ms range). This condition leads that |03?/ ?\n? | (|03?1 ?\n? |) are larger by several \norders of magnitude than |02?</ ?\n<? | (|02?<1 ?\n<? |). It is then safe to ignore the wave \npropagation terms from (2.7) equations, and dielectric permittivity (?) play no further role in \n\nthis discussion. But, if the electrical conductivity is low enough (like ? = 0.0001 S.m\n-1\n, electric \n\nresistivity of 10000 ?.m) and the angular frequency high enough (like ? = 2?\u00d710\n6\n rad.s\n\n-1\n) \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 11\n\nthan ? ? ??, the electromagnetic response of the earth is fully described by Equations (2.7) \nwith all terms kept. \n\n \n\nThese simplifications are generally referred as the quasi-stationary approach and are best \n\nconsidered in the frequency-domain version of the wave equations. Applying Fourier \n\nTransformation to these wave equations, with respect to time leads to: \n\n \n\n     ?2= \n ?02>&lt;? ?03>?= ? 0    (2.8a) \n \n\n    ?2@ \n ?02>&lt;? ?03>?@ ? 0    (2.8b) \nwith \n\n    A&lt;? 02>&lt;? ?03> ? ?B?D?

The admittivity \nD? ? 3 \n ?2> and the impedivity B? ? ?0>  is such defined (Harrington, 1961). \n \n\nEquations (2.8) can be now rewritten as; \n\n \n\n     ?2= \n A<= ? 0     (2.10a) \n \n\n     ?2@ \n A<@ ? 0    (2.10b) \n \n\nBoth sets of equations (2.8) and (2.10) are known as Helmholtz equations. The expression in \n\nthe brackets (equations 2.8a and 2.8b) describes the differences between the electric \n\ndisplacement currents and the electric conducting currents. As stated, frequencies less than \n\n10\n5\n Hz mean that conducting currents are much larger than the displacement currents, when \n\nreal earth materials are considered.

The applied current of 1 A has been turned off abruptly at t = 0 s. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4 \u2013 Application of the TEM method \n \n\nThe TEM method, as previously derived, is sensitive to electrical conductivity averaged over \n\nthe volume of ground in which induced electric currents are caused to flow. Among the \n\nsurface applied geophysical methods that sense bulk electrical properties of the subsurface \n\nof the earth, this CSEM offers deeper penetration capability than GPR techniques and \n\ngreater resolving power than DC resistivity methods. The method performs substantially \n\nbetter in conductive soils or high radar reflectivity zones where GPR often encounters \n\ndifficulties. As mention before, TEM also performs well in highly resistive terrains where it\u2019s \n\ndifficult to establishing a good electrode contact with the ground, as required for most DC \n\nmethods (Everett and Meju, 2005). \n\n \n\nNowadays, it\u2019s easy to operate TEM equipment at the field, with the available generation of \n\ncommercial inexpensive instruments. The output power signal can reach several hundred \n\nwatt, with the applied electric current from 1 A to several tens of ampere, allowing loop\u2019s \n\ndiameters to the hundred meters level. However, most of the TEM data is extensively \n\nacquired with the central loop or coincident (single) loop configurations. That is because \n\nmost of the developed have been made for those geometries (Morrison et al., 1969; Patra, \n\n1970; Lee and Lewis, 1974; Kaufman, 1979; Nabighian, 1979; Verma and Mallick, 1979; \n\nSpies and Raiche, 1980; Raiche and Spies, 1981; Hoversten and Morrison, 1982; Rai and \n\nSarma, 1986; Newmann et al., 1987; Goldman and Fittermann, 1987; Smith and West, 1988, \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 20\n\n1989; Buselli et al., 1990; Hoekstra and Blohm, 1990; Nabighian and Macnae, 1991; Karmis \n\net al., 2003, Zhdanov, 2009), because of the computational intricacies and difficulties \n\nassociated with the TEM response for arbitrary in-loop and offset-loop receiver locations. As \n\na matter of fact, only a few analytical or semi-analytical TEM response expressions have \n\nbeen published yet for the arbitrary source receiver offsets at the surface of the \n\nhomogeneous earth model (Singh et al., 2009). The problem arises due to the computational \n\ncomplexities resulting from the product of Bessel\u2019s functions in frequency-domain \n\nexpressions (Ward and Hohmann, 1988). \n\n \n\nThe processing of field data can be done throughout a variety of available options, ranging \n\nfrom construction of apparent conductivity curves based on simple asymptotic derived \n\nformulas, for rapid subsurface evaluation, like expression (2.42), to 1-D, 2-D and a few \n\nadvanced 3-D forward modelling and inversion, for more detailed analyses. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4.1 \u2013 Transient diffusion distance \n \n\nTo implement the derived equation\u2019s theory, a typical transmitter current waveform with a \n\n\u201cslow rise\u201d to a steady-on value is applied to the transmitter loop (figure 2.1). That just \n\ninduces a static magnetic field, the primary field. This contains no information about the \n\nearth, but is proportional to the magnetic moment, M, given by: \n\n \n\n     M ? ?\u00b6\u00b7\u00b8\u00b9\u00b9\u00ba     (2.43) \n \n\nwith n being the number of turns of the loop, Aloop the area of the loop [m\n2\n] and I the direct \n\ncurrent intensity [A]. \n\n \n\nThis steady current is followed by a rapid shut-off, as exemplified by the linear ramp decay at \n\nfigure 2.1. This disturbance through the loop breaks the initial primary magnetic-field that \n\nbegins to decay and generates a primary magnetic-field that is in-phase with, or proportional \n\nto the corresponding transmitter loop current. This current causes an electric-field to be \n\ninduced and eddy currents to begin running in the ground near the coil, (figure 2.2). Due to \n\nohmic loss by heat dissipation at the medium, these currents will soon begin to decay, \n\nthereby inducing a secondary magnetic field. This secondary magnetic is weak, and \n\nproduced in proportion to the waning strength of those eddy currents. Immediately, after the \n\ncurrent had been turned off, the strength of the secondary and primary fields are of the same \n\norder. Since the decay of these currents is a function of earth\u2019s conductivity, the same \n\nhappens with the secondary magnetic-field intensity. The decay of the secondary magnetic \n\nfield induces an electromotive force in the receiver loop or coil that is measured trough time. \n\nMost TEM systems take voltage measurements during the transmitter off-time, when the \n\nprimary field is already absent. The off-time measure\u2019s advantage is that the relatively too \n\nmuch weak secondary field signal is not swamped by the stronger primary field signal. \n\n \n\nThis induction process at the earth subsurface is equivalent to the diffusion of the transmitter \n\nloop image into a conducting medium. The similarity of the equations governing \n\nelectromagnetic induction and hydrodynamic vortex motion was first noticed by Helmholtz \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 21\n\n(Everett and Meju, 2005). This has lead directly to the association of this current image with \n\na \u201csmoke ring\u201d, but care must be taken as the latter is not \u201cblown\u201d, as usually thought, but \n\ninstead moves by self-induction with a velocity (maximum value given by 2.27 equation) that \n\nis generated by the smoke ring\u2019s own vorticity and described by the famous Biot-Savart law. \n\nAn electromagnetic smoke ring dissipates in a conductive medium much as the strength of a \n\nhydrodynamic eddy is attenuated by the viscosity of its host fluid. The medium property that \n\ndissipates the electromagnetic smoke ring is the electrical conductivity. \n\n \n\nDuring the ramp-off, the induced current assumes the shape of the horizontal projection of \n\nthe transmitter loop on the surface of the conducting earth. This \u201csmoke ring current like\u201d, \n\nadvances and diffuses downward and outward through the ground and time, at an angle of \n\napproximately 30\u00ba with horizontal, while decrease in amplitude. Current always flows \n\nhorizontally with no downward component. The sense of the circulating induced currents is \n\nsuch that the secondary magnetic field tends to maintain the total magnetic field at its original \n\nsteady-on value prior to the transmitter ramp-off situation (Lenz law). Therefore, the induced \n\ncurrents flow in the same direction as the transmitter current, to compensate for transmitter \n\ncurrent decrease. \n\n \n\nThe penetration depth, Zd, at a given time t was already deduced at expression (2.26). This \n\ndepth corresponds to the vertical location of the surface current maximum (Nabighian and \n\nMacnae, 1991) and is also known as diffusion length or diffusion depth. Often the diffusion \n\ndistance is defined as: \n\n \n\n     d ? 2\u00bb\u00bc\u00bd     (2.44) \n \n\nThe maximum depth, to which measurements can be obtained, Zlast, is not only a function of \n\nthe applied magnetic moment, but also of the noise level, Vnoise acquisition at the measuring \n\ncoil or loop (Christensen, 1995): \n\n \n\n    \u00bc\u00b8lJ( ? o&lt;<\u00be??p\nG G\u00a5? o \u00bf\u00ae\u00c0\u00c1\u00c2\u00c3\u00c4\u00c5p\n\nG \u00be?\n    (2.45) \n\n \n\nAt this depth, the measurements are greatly noise influenced, and became unsatisfactory. \n\nAccording to Christensen (1995) a practical limit could be when the SNR (Signal to Noise \n\nRatio) equals the unit. This distance corresponds to the tlast time, by the expression (2.25): \n\n \n\n    \n\u00b8lJ( ? \u00b5o\u00ae?p\n? \u00be? o \u00bf<\u00a5\u00c0\u00c1\u00c2\u00c3\u00c4\u00c5p\n\n&lt;\u00be?\n    (2.46) \n\n \n\nAs already mentioned, the maximum penetration depth is a function of the applied magnetic \n\nmoment. Equation (2.45) expresses that dependency, Zlast is proportional to M\n1/5\n\n. Thereby a \n\ndramatic increase in magnetic moment is always needed to increase the maximum \n\npenetration depth. \n\n \n\nThe magnetic-field configuration, for a given time, is shown at figure 2.9, with the \u201csmoke \n\nring\u201d current superimposed. A conductive homogeneous half-space is considered. \n  \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 22\n\nFigure 2.9 \u2013 Magnetic field cross-section representation bellow a square loop, for a given time (after \n\nshut-off). The \u201csmoke ring\u201d like current is also added. (Adapted from Nabighian and Macnae, 1991). \n\n \n\nFor each time, the vertical profile of current density is calculated from the electric field at the \n\nearth by Ohm\u2019s law. That current density decays rapidly with depth at any given instant in \n\ntime, as plotted at figure 2.10, for tree time instants. The corresponding equivalent \n\npenetration depth (skin depth) is also represented. \n\nFigure 2.10 \u2013 Change in current density as a function of depth for \n\nseveral time instants (adapted from Zhdanov, 2009). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4.2 \u2013Time stages in the diffusion process \n \n\nPrevious expressions (2.40 to 2.42) have been derived upon the assumption of a small ?, \n\n(2.38a). That means a late time (or late stage) behaviour. Let\u2019s take a characteristic \n\ngeometric dimension of the loop, such as r, the distance between the center of the \n\ntransmitter and receiver loops or the transmitter-receiver loop radius for a coincident (or \n\nsingle) one loop. The stages can be defined as (Nabighian and Macnae, 1991): \n\n \n\n- early time (early stage) for d E r \n- intermediate time (intermediate stage) for d \u00ad r \n- late time (late stage) for d \u00c6 r \n \n\nFor each of these stages, simple asymptotic formulas can be derived, and thus solely valid \n\nand applicable in that same range. Deduced expressions (2.40) to (2.42) are the asymptotic \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 23\n\nones when t ? ? , and consecutively ? ? 0, a late stage condition. That means greater \n\ndistances from the loop. For t ? 0 , and consecutively ? ? ? , early stage asymptotic \n\nexpression also exist: \n\n \n\n     lim(\u00ac\u00a5 ,_ \u00ad ? ?U?\u00c7l o1 ?

At \n\nfigure 2.11, the early and late stage apparent resistivity is plotted against time. It shows \n\nclearly that asymptotic approximation to apparent resistivity values are only valid at first \n\nbeginning of early stage and to the end of late stage, diverging otherwise. To avoid \n\nmiscalculations of the apparent resistivity, it is therefore necessary to use the exact formula, \n\ngiven by expression (2.39), especially at the stages not covered by asymptotic expressions. \n\nThe differences are notorious when comparing the full and late asymptotic apparent \n\nresistivity (figure 2.12). \n\nFigure 2.11 \u2013 Apparent resistivity curves for early and late stage for a circular in \n\nloop central measure (50 m radius) over a homogeneous 100 ?.m half-space earth. \n\nThe applied current of 1 A has been turned off abruptly at t = 0 s. \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 24\n\nCharacteristics of early and late-stage TEM vertical magnetic-field can be thus summarized \n\nas follows. Receiver measures with a central coil or coincident (or single) loop. \n\n \n\nEarly time: \n\ndiffusion distance is much less than transmitter-receiver separation, \n\ndiffusion current is concentrated near transmitter loop, \n\nmeasured voltage o\u00b1,_\u00b1e p is independent of time, \nmeasured voltage o\u00b1,_\u00b1e p is linearly proportional to ?. \n\n \n\nIntermediate time: \n\ncomplex behaviour, \n\nmeasured voltage o\u00b1,_\u00b1e p relationship to ? is changing. \n \n\nLate time: \n\ndiffusion depth greater than transmitter-receiver separation, \n\nmeasured voltage o\u00b1,_\u00b1e p relationship is proportional do 1/ t5/2, \nmeasured voltage o\u00b1,_\u00b1e p relationship is proportional do 1/ ?3/2. \n\n \n\nIn contrast to the incident EM plane wave response of a homogenous conductive half-space \n\nwhich yields equations that can be easily solved for the true resistivity (therefore, defining a \n\nunique apparent resistivity result, e.g., in magnetotellurics), the usual time-domain response \n\nequations do not allow a single to all-time apparent resistivity solution. Nevertheless, it is \n\ncustomary to use the derived asymptotic relations to define early time and/or late time \n\nformulations to calculate those two apparent resistivities. That is still assumed as first \n\napproach, especially with some acquisition field equipment used for deeper TEM soundings. \n\nFigure 2.12 \u2013 Example of apparent resistivity from calculated asymptotic \n\n?a(t) and exact ?f(t) expressions (adapted from Barsukov et al.

(AEMR). This \n\nelectromagnetic prospecting tool it\u2019s the TEM-FAST 48, a very small, compact and portable \n\nunit, easy to deploy and apply at field work, even under hard conditions (figure 2.13). It was \n\ndeveloped and builds under the chosen strategy of being a \"simple - fast - robust\" system. \n\nThe complete set, with a single main transmitter-receiver unit, cables and loop weights about \n\n5 kg. External gel power batteries can be used, adding a couple more kilograms to be carried \n\nat the field. \n\nFigure 2.13 \u2013 TEM FAST 48 set with main unit (103 mm \u00d7 27 mm \u00d7 310 mm), loop cables \n\nand small pocket personal computer, (original photography from AEMR). \n\n \n\nOne of the most important features of any TEM equipment is the time duration of the self-\n\ntransient process. That process is only dependent on the transmitter-antenna-receiver \n\nsystem properties. Obviously, proper quality TEM signals measures, and results are feasible \n\nonly within the time interval where that self-transient process of the system is missing. The \n\nshorter the self-transient process is, earlier are the time delays and measures becomes \n\nfeasible, allowing also the minimum depth of study. \n\n \n\n2.5.1 \u2013 TEM-FAST 48 technical specifications \n \n\nThe 48 at TEM-FAST 48\u2019s name stand for the maximum allowed number of acquisition \n\nchannels. Those 48 time gate channels range from 4,1 \u00b5s to 15,4 ms, spanning over four \n\ndecades at the ratio of 12 channel/decade. This very short beginning time of 4,1 \u00b5s after \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 26\n\nturn-off, offer one to get information about the first few meter\u2019s depth, when using small loops \n\n(1-10 meter size). The following characteristics are described at TEM-FAST 48 own manual. \n\nThe transmitter unit output current amplitude pulses can be selected as one or four ampere. \n\nThis is the maximum current allowed values. At the 4 A option, this extreme value is not \n\nusually reached. The achieved output current is only limited by the loop load resistivity value. \n\nThe resistive loop values spans from a few to 20 ohm, with typically less than 0.01 H \n\ninductance and around 3 nF capacity (1 A output). The time of turning off the current's pulse, \n\nwith a square single loop and 1 A option, is less than 3 \u00b5s (25 m \u00d7 25 m side size loop), 8 \u00b5s \n\n(50 m \u00d7 50 m) and 20 \u00b5s (100 m \u00d7 100 m). The ratio pulse/pause output current \u201csquare \n\nwave\u201d is of 3 to 1. This special sequence of unipolar rectangular current pulses, provides at \n\nregistration of long slow processes in well conducting media the minimal dynamic error \n\ncaused by imposing of transients from both fronts of current pulses in transmitting loop \n\nantenna. Transmitted current pulse form, both theoretical and real, is given at figure 2.14. \n\nFigure 2.14 \u2013 Applied rectangular current pulses form of TEM FAST 48 (adapted from AEMR, 2006). \n\n \n\nReal voltage and current output test measures at loop are also shown at figures 2.15 and \n\n2.16, respectively. Those figures express the known fact that, useful data it\u2019s postponed to \n\nincreased times with the loop size dimensions. It is also expected some distortion at the \n\noutput signal, especially at the maximum current value of 4 A (as seen at figure 2.17), as the \n\nextreme output voltage of the transistor used in the unit is equal to about 850 V. This effect \n\ncan distort the measured transient process at a time less than 6-7 \u00b5s (20 m \u00d7 20 m size \n\nloop), 15-20 \u00b5s (50 m \u00d7 50 m) and until 40 \u00b5s (100 m \u00d7100 m). \n\nFigure 2.15 \u2013 Expected and measured loop antenna normalized voltage after turn off, \n\nfor 20 m and 50 m side square loop (adapted from AEMR, 2006).  \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 27\n\nFigure 2.16 \u2013 Measured loop antenna normalized current after turn off, \n\nfor 20 m and 50 m side square loop (adapted from AEMR, 2006). \n\n \n\nThe input voltage to power on the unit is done by the internal 12 V, 2 Ah battery. External \n\npower can be provided with a 12 or 24 V option, being the 24 V the best and maximum \n\npower unit choice. \n\nFigure 2.17 \u2013 Measured loop antenna normalized voltage after turn off, for the 50 m \u00d7 50 m loop \n\nwith an applied current of 1 A and 4 A (adapted from AEMR, 2006). \n\n \n\nThe receiver frequency band is greater than four MHz, allowing a correct time signal \n\nmeasure starting from the \u00b5s level. The number of automatically registered delays (time \n\ngates) spans from 16 to 48. The complete description and definition of these time gates are \n\ngiven at table 2.2, table 2.3 and figure 2.18. The electromagnetic cultural noise suppression \n\nis implemented with the 50 Hz or 60 Hz option, and is greater than 60 dB. The internal noise \n\nmeasure is at the 1 \u00b5V level (rms), with a dynamic range of 10\n7\n (10 V to 1 \u00b5V) or 140 dB. A \n\n10 times signal amplification can be turned on. That can be necessary when in loop \n\nconfiguration is used. Constructor reported overall systematic voltage errors are 1 %. This is \n\ndone in the operational temperature range -20 \u00b0C to +65 \u00b0C, as the acquisition system \n\nprovides stable results of measurements at sharp changes of temperature, up to 3 \n\n\u00b0C/minute. The unit performs also auto-calibrating and testing, tracing a correctness of work \n\nof the device during measurements, even in case when the noise level at input of the \n\nreceiver achieves 1 V to 2 V. \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 28\n\nTable 2.2 \u2013 TEM-FAST 48 time gates and time integration signal definition of strobe pulses, \n\n(adapted from AEMR, 2006). \n\nTime \n\ngate \n\ntstart tfinish tcenter ?t Time \n\ngate \n\ntstart tfinish tcenter ?t \n\n\u00b5s \u00b5s \n\n1 3.6 4.6 4.06 1 25 255.6 319.6 285 64 \n\n2 4.6 5.6 5.07 1 26 319.6 383.6 350 64 \n\n3 5.6 6.6 6.07 1 27 383.6 447.6 414 64 \n\n4 6.6 7.6 7.08 1 28 447.6 511.6 478 64 \n\n5 7.6 9.6 8.52 2 29 511.6 639.6 570 128 \n\n6 9.6 11.6 10.53 2 30 639.6 767.6 699 128 \n\n7 11.6 13.6 12.55 2 31 767.6 895.6 828 128 \n\n8 13.6 15.6 14.56 2 32 895.6 1023.6 956 128 \n\n9 15.6 19.6 17.44 4 33 1023.6 1279.6 1152 256 \n\n10 19.6 23.6 21.46 4 34 1279.6 1535.6 1408 256 \n\n11 23.6 27.6 25.49 4 35 1535.6 1791.6 1664 256 \n\n12 27.6 31.6 29.50 4 36 1791.6 2047.6 1920 256 \n\n13 31.6 39.6 35.28 8 37 2047.6 2559.6 2304 512 \n\n14 39.6 47.6 43.30 8 38 2559.6 3071.6 2816 512 \n\n15 47.6 55.6 51.40 8 39 3071.6 3583.6 3328 512 \n\n16 55.6 63.6 59.41 8 40 3583.6 4095.6 3840 512 \n\n17 63.6 79.6 71.60 16 41 4095.6 5119.6 4608 1024 \n\n18 79.6 95.6 87.60 16 42 5119.6 6143.6 5632 1024 \n\n19 95.6 111.6 103.6 16 43 6143.6 7167.6 6656 1024 \n\n20 111.6 127.6 119.6 16 44 7167.6 8191.6 7680 1024 \n\n21 127.6 159.6 143.6 32 45 8191.6 10239.6 9216 2048 \n\n22 159.6 191.6 175.6 32 46 10239.6 12287.6 11264 2048 \n\n23 191.6 223.6 207.6 32 47 12287.6 14335.6 13312 2048 \n\n24 223.6 255.6 239.6 32 48 14335.6 16383.6 15360 2048 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.18 \u2013 Growing channel integration time with time amount and decreasing signal intensity. \n\nafter turn off (adapted from AEMR. 2006).  \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 29\n\nTable 2.3 \u2013 TEM-FAST 48 number of active channels (time range), \n\nfor the 50 Hz and 60 Hz option, (adapted from AEMR, 2006). \n\nTEM-FAST \n48 \n\nTime Range \n\nMaximum \ntime \n\nNumber of \nactive time \n\ngates \n\nSignal \nanalog \nstack \n\nTon+Toff \n50 Hz \n\nTotal Ton+Toff \n60 Hz \n\nTotal \n\n\u00b5s ms ms \n1 64 16 1024 0.3125 320 0.26 266 \n2 128 20 512 0.625 320 0.52 266 \n3 256 24 256 1.25 320 1.042 266 \n4 512 28 128 2.5 320 2.08 266 \n5 1024 32 64 5 320 4.17 266 \n6 2048 36 32 10 320 8.33 266 \n7 4096 40 16 30 480 25 400 \n8 8192 44 8 50 400 41.67 333 \n9 16384 48 4 90 360 75 300 \n\n \n\nMeasurements of transient decay signal voltage E(t) for some channels is schematically \n\nshown at figure 2.19. For each strobe at each consecutive channel, the signal is grabbed and \n\nstored, to be analog stacked on the next run. Thus, the transient is gated practically \n\ncontinuously without \"dead zones\". This is done by the internal algorithm known as DAS \n\n(multi-channel strobe system, integration and storage of the analog information). After \n\ntermination of DAS processes, the output signals are digitized by the ADC (Analog-to-Digital \n\nConverter), transferred to the control block, and the integrators reset into initial condition. The \n\nnumber of strobe-pulses at the analog stacking phase is given at Table 2.3, for the several \n\nmodes of the unit operations. ADC dynamic range is 16 bits, with smallest unit being 1 \u00b5V. \n\nThe joint work DAS plus ADC provides measurement of sizes E(t)/I in the already described \n\ndynamic range of 1 \u00b5VA\n-1\n to 10 VA\n\n-1\n. The dynamic range of the signals E(t)/I depends on the \n\nvalue of the input parameters \u201cTime Range\u201d. \n\nFigure 2.19 \u2013 Multi-channel data acquisition holding and integration DAS scheme, \n\nafter turn off, (adapted from AEMR, 2006).  \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 30\n\nThis procedure is automatically repeated for several times, to a maximum number of 20 \n\nstacks. Each stack corresponds to 13 complete work cycles of DAS algorithm system. At full \n\nstack and with all 48 channels, acquisition time of a single TEM sounding can last almost 10 \n\nminutes. The collected and grabbed data is saved into a small pocket personal computer \n\n(iPAQ), linked to the TEM-FAST 48 unit. This piece of equipment runs the program (AEMR, \n\n2006) that supply and controls the main unit\u2019s selective parameters. \n\n \n\nStacking the measured signals not only enhances the SNR, but also outputs the associated \n\nerror to each channel measure. Typically, the higher channels (that correspond to signal late \n\nstages) are always more noisy when compared to the early ones, as seen at figure 2.20. \n\nFigure 2.20 \u2013 A typical TEM sounding curve with data points and corresponding error band. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.6 \u2013 Transient signals noise origin \n \n\nThe TEM method measures the magnetic flux in the induction coil or loop. For accurate, \n\ncorrect and reliable interpretation of the responses in terms of subsurface geology, it\u2019s \n\nimportant to recognize the various electromagnetic noise sources that may be present in \n\nTEM responses. \n\n \n\nThere are natural and \u201cartificial\u201d (man-made) sources of EM noise. Within these two kinds of \n\nsources it is also essential to differentiate between what is coherent and what is incoherent \n\nEM noise (figure 2.21). Incoherent noise is, by definition, temporally uncorrelated with the \n\nTEM transmitted source current. Coherent noise will significantly change the shape of the \n\nTEM data curve.  \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 31\n\nFigure 2.21 \u2013 EM noise classification; Incoherent noise (at blue colour) \n\nand coherent (at red colour) for the TEM acquisition data\u2019s stand view. \n\n \n\nEnvironmental sources of incoherent noise in the frequency range (10\n2\n Hz to 10\n\n6\n Hz) in \n\nhydrogeophysical studies with EM methods, can be identified in the electromagnetic noise \n\nspectrum, (figure 2.22), spanning from 10\n-2\n Hz to 10\n\n5\n Hz frequencies. \n\nFigure 2.22 \u2013 EM noise spectrum intensity in the frequency range of interest to \n\nTEM hydrogeophysical investigations (adapted from Palacky and West (1991)). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.6.1 \u2013 EM incoherent noise \n \n\nThe predominant environmental noise sources (called spherics) are caused by impulsive \n\nlightning discharges whose EM radiation can propagate over thousands of kilometres within \n\nthe earth-ionosphere waveguide. The sources of this EM radiation are the lightning \n\ndischarges occurring all over the world. The continuous thunderstorms at the equatorial and \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 32\n\ntropical regions of the earth\u2019s globe, like Brazil, Central Africa or Malaysia, are the major \n\ncontributors to this random character noise. The labels \u201cTEM\u201d and \u201cTM\u201d under spherics \n\ndesignation, refer to different waveguide modes of propagation (Wait, 1962), whereas the \n\nshape of the background continuum within the spherics band is determined by the cut-off \n\nfrequencies of this two modes (Porrat et al., 2001). Usually noise from spherics has a \n\nfrequency above 1 Hz. The lower continuum below 1 Hz frequency is caused by large-scale \n\ngeomagnetic pulsations that arise in the response to the solar wind interaction with Earth\u2019s \n\nmagnetosphere. The fluctuations in the Earth\u2019s magnetic field due to the solar wind, Earth\u2019s \n\nrotation and the magnetic field are large-scale ones, do not interfere significantly with the \n\nmeasurements since they contribute only to the low-frequency noise, below 1 Hz (Spies and \n\nFrischknecht, 1991). \n\n \n\nThe transient measured data is always an averaging of the induced electromotive force in the \n\nreceiver loop or coil within the time gate channels. TEM equipments usually have logarithmic \n\ngating, that means that gate\u2019s length is proportional to delay time (table 2.2). When the \n\nenvironmental noise is \u201cwhite\u201d (i.e., stochastic through all frequencies), this logarithmic gating \n\nresult in an effective noise decay of t\n?1/2\n\n. However, the surrounding noises are not a \u201cwhite \n\nspectrum\u201d, as seen at figure 2.22. At a local scale, we can have superimposed spectra of AM \n\ntransmitters with high amplitudes at single frequencies around 200 kHz. At these conditions, \n\naveraging and stacking such monochromatic signal results in an effective noise decay of t\n?1\n\n \n\n(Effers\u00f8 et al. 1999). This contribution will dominate at early times, whereas the stochastic \n\nnoise will dominate at late time stages. That\u2019s also the case with the superimposed spikes on \n\nthe background continuum spectrum at figure 2.22, caused by the 50 Hz and 60 Hz (and \n\nharmonics) supply power lines and radio signals from very low frequency (VLF) transmitters, \n\nused primarily by the navy military communication. The near-surface VLF hydrogeophysical \n\ninvestigation method uses these emissions (around 15 kHz to 24 kHz) as a signal source \n\n(Newman et al., 2003) (table 2.1), but for the most part, these transmissions are rather a \n\nsource of noise. These are considered cultural noise, and will be next described. Other types \n\nof incoherent noise can include electronic and thermal noise in the receiver amplifiers of the \n\nsignal. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.6.2 \u2013 EM coherent noise \n \n\nCoherent noise, however, is much more problematic. This kind of noise is temporally \n\ncorrelated with the transmitted source current and can include transmitter or receiver loop \n\nmisalignment (when other then single loop geometry is used) or instrumental drift. Also, \n\ngeometrical errors are introduced if the transmitter-receiver single loop is not perfectly \n\nsquared. These geometric errors may also be induced by topography, but even if the ground \n\nis not flat the smoke rings currents will soon begin to travel downwards as if it was \n\n(Nabighian and Macnae, 1991). These effects are reduced by careful experimental and data \n\nprocessing procedures. Other sources of coherent noise are induced currents in conductive \n\nstructures not classified as the primary target of the hydrogeophysical investigation. The two \n\nmajor classes are geologic and cultural noise. \n\n \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 33\n\nGeological noise can be defined as the electromagnetic field generated by induced currents \n\nflowing in fine-scale geological heterogeneities that are too small, too numerous and \n\ncomplicated to be described in detail and hence accounted in the numerical simulations to by \n\ndone (Everett and Weiss, 2002). That includes anisotropy, frequency-dependent \n\nconductivity, dipping layers and near-surface inhomogeneities. Layers are commonly \n\nassumed to be homogeneous and parallel to the surface, and because this is obviously not \n\nalways the case, errors are introduced. Small inhomogeneities disturb more the early times \n\nmeasures than the late times one, due to the smaller earth volume covered by the \n\nmeasurements at early times. Electrical conductivity may even vary with direction, as it is \n\nseen in sedimentary rocks where it is typically higher parallel to bedding than perpendicular \n\nto bedding. This is the called anisotropy, and a measure of this is the anisotropy factor (Spies \n\nand Frischknecht, 1991): \n\n \n\n     ? ? F?\u00cb ???      (2.50) \n \n\nwhere ?L and ?T are the longitudinal and transverse conductivity, respectively. \n\n \n\nFurthermore, electrical conductivity is not always independent of frequency, giving rise to \n\ninduced polarization (IP) effects. After currents are turned off in the transmitter loop, vortex \n\ncurrents are induced in the ground beneath it. After signal turn-off, ions in the pore space \n\nfluids will begin to move in the same direction as the created vortex currents, thereby \n\ncreating an additional current, the polarization current. The result is a decreasing resistivity \n\nat early times. These ions will begin \u201dpiling up\u201d at places of low mobility, the \u201dcharged state\u201d \n\n(Flis et al., 1989). As the vortex currents begin to decay, these ions will move back into their \n\noriginal place, to the equilibrium position, but now at a much slower rate. This movement \n\ngives rise to a second polarization current, this time of opposite direction. Given a sufficiently \n\npolarizable earth, the polarization current may dominate the vortex current at late times, \n\nthereby possibly reversing the signal (Flis et al., 1989). The IP effect will be detailed further \n\non this chapter. \n\n \n\nCultural noise is man-made. Major contributors are the 50 Hz or 60 Hz human power-lines \n\nsupply. Associated to this situation, we have transient signals from switching on and off \n\nelectric equipment, especially at densely human populated areas. Cultural noise is also the \n\nelectromagnetic field generated by currents induced in man-made electrical conductors such \n\nas buried pipes, tanks and drums, fences, pipelines and power lines scaffoldings, or other \n\nobjects (Qian and Boerner, 1995). These electrical conductors must be, if possible, included \n\nin numerical simulations so that their distorting effects on the TEM response can be properly \n\nevaluated. VLF transmitters and AM radio signals can be and are filtered out by low pass \n\nfilters. \n\n \n\nThe action at all these objects creates a measurable secondary magnetic field if they are in \n\nthe vicinity of the sounding. The time constants of direct induction in these features are \n\nusually negligible as a result of the relatively small cross-section, so the main contribution \n\ncomes from the ability to channel currents induced in the surrounding media (Danielsen et \n\nal., 2003), (Spies and Frischknecht, 1991). Coupling noise with TEM loop can be either \n\ncapacitive or galvanic in origin, as can be seen, respectively in figure 2.23 and 2.24. \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 34\n\nFigure 2.23 \u2013 Sounding whit capacitive coupling noise (adapted from Danielsen et al. (2003)). \n\nFigure 2.24 \u2013 Sounding whit galvanic coupling noise (adapted from Danielsen et al. (2003)). \n\n \n\nThe former situation happens when the conductor is isolated, i.e. there is no contact between \n\nthis and the surrounding media. The earth plus the insulator conductor system, work as an L-\n\nC-R electrical circuit, giving rise to a secondary magnetic field in the conductor. Capacitive \n\ncouplings may be easily recognized as fluctuations in the TEM sounding curves. They are \n\nrelated to modern high-power lines, insulated underground cables and telephone cables \n\n(Danielsen et al., 2003), (Spies and Frischknecht, 1991). \n\n \n\nGalvanic coupling requires galvanic contact with the conductor. The current runs from the \n\nsurrounding media into the electric conductor and back, so the system can be regarded as \n\nan L-R electrical circuit. Galvanic couplings result only in a change of shape (bump) in the \n\nsounding curve, making them difficult to recognize, although the resulting attained model \n\noften contains an anomalously high conductivity. They are related to metallic fences, power \n\nline\u2019s earthed connection, pipes or old type power cables with a metallic protection shielding \n\n(Danielsen et al., 2003), (Spies and Frischknecht, 1991). \n\n \n\nThe intensity effect of a coupling depends on the shape of the conductor and his distance to \n\nthe transmitter-receiver loop, r. The shape of conductors may be three-dimensional (3D), \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 35\n\ntwo-dimensional (2D) or elongated with ends (referred to as 2.5D). The response of a 3D \n\nconductor decays proportional to r\n6\n while the response of 2.5D and 2D conductors decay \n\nproportional to r\n4\n and r\n\n2\n, respectively. A safety distance of 100-200 m from those noisy \n\nsources is often suggested. The safety distance increases with increasing resistivity \n\n(Danielsen et al., 2003). \n \n\nGeological and cultural noise like capacitive and galvanic coupling cannot be filtered or \n\nstacked out of TEM data easily, because of the mutual induction between the causative \n\nstructures and the host geology. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.7 \u2013 Induced Polarization and Superparamagnetic effects \n \n\nAs earlier referred, sometimes the TEM measured signals can be affected by means of \n\nfrequency dependence of dielectric permittivity (?), known as the induced polarization (IP) \n\neffect, i.e. a dispersive phenomenon. It can occur also that magnetic permittivity (\u00b5) of some \n\nearth layer or body is not that of free space. When such situation takes place, we can have a \n\nsow called superparamagnetic effect (SPM). \n\n \n\n2.7.1 \u2013 Induced Polarization effect \n \n\nInduction polarization is a complex phenomenon controlled by many physical and \n\nphysicochemical reactions associated with the current passage through earth rocks. The \n\neffect was initially observed and discovered at galvanic measurement\u2019s data in the middle of \n\nlast century, and it was thereafter systematically studied and incorporated into many \n\ngeophysical researches (Antonov and Shein, 2008). This natural phenomenon was widely \n\nobserved at various geological media, essentially due to the influence on results at practically \n\nall EM researches. There is a great and positive experience of the IP effect use in classical \n\nresearches of mineral deposits with direct and quasi-direct current methods, to achieve \n\npetrophysical properties of rocks with it. The applicability of the effect still is not fulfilled from \n\na \"practical\" point of view in induction EM. IP is considered as \"noise\" and the recipes to \n\novercome with it are yet under developed, e.g., Pelton et al. (1983 and 1984), Oldenburg and \n\nLi (1994), Effers\u00f8 (2000), Routh and Oldenburg (2001), El-Kaliouby (2001), Antonov and \n\nShein (2008). \n\n \n\nSome relationships do exist to account for this dispersion effect on TEM data. Most of IP \n\nmodels came from a phenomenological approach implying boundary-value solutions of \n\nMaxwell\u2019s equations, for frequency-dependent resistivity. The Cole-Cole expression is one of \n\nthe commonly applied to account for this polarization effect (Cole and Cole, 1941), and is \n\nwritten as; \n\n \n\n    ??>? ? ?\u00a5 \u00cc1 ? ??1 ? GGK?\u00ce\u00cf\u00d0?\u00d1\u00a4\u00d2   (2.51) \n \n\nwhere \u00d3 is the chargeability (or polarizability) defined as ? ? 1 ? ??/?\u00a5, the ?? is the high \nfrequency (infinite) resistivity and ?\u00a5 the low frequency (DC) resistivity, ? is the time constant \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 36\n\nof IP process (relaxation time), ? is the so-called \"logarithmic speed\" or \"parameter c\", \n\ndescribing the variation of phase with frequency. The concepts of high and low frequency is \n\nnot strictly determined, as in TEM practice, ?\u00a5 is the resistivity on a constant current, and the \n?? is the resistivity at frequency range of 50 kHz to 100 kHz (which is actually the really \nmeasured limiting research frequency for TEM-FAST48 equipment). \n\n \n\nThe IP effect comes because, when a displacement occurs in a material, there is a \n\ndisplacement current represented by the charge\u2019s movement from the rest positions to the \n\ndisplaced positions. This current persists for only a limited amount of time, lasting from the \n\nmoment at which the charge is first caused to move by the applied electric field to the \n\nmoment at which the elastic restoring force brings the motion of the charge to a virtual halt. \n\nOver this time span, both the electric conductivity (resistivity) and the dielectric permittivity of \n\nthe medium will vary with frequency. One of the simpler frequency-dependent behaviours in \n\nthose electrical properties is caused by electron\u2019s resonance, which can be characterized by \n\nsimple harmonic motion of an electron in its \u201corbit\u201d when an oscillatory field is applied. That is \n\ngiven by (von Hippel, 1954a, b): \n\n \n\n     ?\u00d6 ? ?? \n \u00d7\u00c4M\u00d7\u00d8GK\u00cf9\u00d09    (2.52) \n \n\nwhere the ?? is the high-frequency limit of dielectric constant, and ?\u00d9 is the low-frequency \nlimit, and ? is the time constant of electron resonance. The low frequency can be even zero \n(DC or \u201cstatic\u201d), ?\u00a5. The dielectric value is ? ? ?\u00d6 ? i?\u00d6\u00d6 , with ?\u00d6 and ?\u00d6\u00d6 the real (storage part) \nand imaginary (loss part) of it (Cole and Cole, 1941). \n\n \n\nThis behaviour is traditionally characterized by a plot in the complex plane (the Cole-Cole \n\nplot), shown in figure 2.25. On this plot, the imaginary response is considered to be the \n\ndielectric permittivity and the real response is considered to be the dielectric loss. The form \n\nof the plot is a semicircle centred on the horizontal axis. Each point along this semicircle \n\nrepresents a specific frequency, increasing from right to left. The intercepts of the circle on \n\nthe dielectric permittivity axis occur at the values for dielectric permittivity at very high and \n\nvery low frequencies, where the displacement has not yet started and where the \n\ndisplacement is complete, respectively. \n\nFigure 2.25 \u2013 The Cole-Cole plot of the frequency-dependent behaviour of the dielectric \n\npermittivity in the complex plane. ?\u00d6\u00d6 is plotted as positive (adapted from Zhdanov, 2009). \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 37\n\nIn this simple and ideal polarization mechanism, the real conduction term is then zero at \n\nextremely high and low frequencies, meaning that no conduction takes place. In real \n\nmaterials, there is always an independent conduction term. The complexity of physical law \n\ngoverning dispersion is far more than that for simple harmonic motion.

Total conduction is the sum of these two components, one being \n\nby free charge carriers (which is largely independent of frequency) and the other one being \n\nby the displacement of bound charge carriers, which is strongly frequency dependent: \n\n \n\n     ?\u00de?\u00df\u00df ? ?\u00e0\u00e1 \n ?\u00e2\u00e1    (2.56) \n\nFigure 2.26 \u2013 The Cole-Cole plot for a material which exhibits both currents; \n\ndisplacement and ohmic one. ?\u00d6\u00d6 is plotted as positive (adapted from Zhdanov, 2009). \n \n\nThe new Cole-Cole plot, has a pattern like the one in figure 2.26; it consists of a portion of a \n\ncircular arc for high-frequency behaviour, with a transition to a rising straight line for low \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 38\n\nfrequency behaviour. The transition from the circular plot to the linear plot depends on the \n\nrelative importance of displacement and conduction currents. With strong conduction \n\ncurrents, the linear portion of the plot becomes dominant. \n\n \n\nExpression (2.51) describes the frequency characteristics of \"infinitesimal\" media cells, and \n\ngenerally speaking, does not contain any restrictions to parameters included in it. From a \n\nphysical point of view, the question on those restrictions is more complicated. That \n\nexpression describes a passive electrical system with the distributed parameters, however, \n\nhaving a \"zeroth volume\", it is then possible to assume the system only consists of the \n\ndistributed resistors R and capacitors C, because the inductance is connected to volumetric \n\nmagnetic interactions of fields, i.e. it is a function of volume, which considered cell have not, \n\nby definition. The (2.51) expression describes the characteristic of a passive RC-circuit, \n\naccording to the classical theory of electrical circuits, impedance or admittance, as the \n\ncomplex function of frequency \u00e3 ? \u00e4 \n ?> (has poles and zeros only at \u00e4 \u00db 0).

However, as exact calculations for horizontal layered media shown, \nthis conclusion is only valid when ?t \u00b5\u00a5R<?  is grater then 20-30. At earlier stages, the close \ninteraction of induction and polarization signals is observed, and the additive summation is \n\ninconvenient. Usually, for calculations of IP in TEM, a rather simple mode is used. The \n\nconductivity of each layer (in integration expressions of the TEM processes), is replaced to \n\nfrequency dependent according to A ? ?eM\u00c9 \u00d0q? ? eM\u00c9 \u00d09? ? ln ??G ?<???  (TEM time constants \nvalues ?G \u00c6 ?&lt;depend on many factors and usually can be taken as ?G ? 1 s and ?&lt;? 1 \u00b5s) \nthen make Fourier and Hankel transformation. \n\n \n\nIn many cases, the IP effect is adequately described by the well-known Cole-Cole dispersive \n\nresistivity relation (2.51). But in a series of cases, Cole-Cole is not sufficient to explain the \n\nmaterials frequency dependence. More empirical relations do exist, like the Classical \n\nDielectric Dispersion, Special Dielectric Dispersion, Cole-Davidson Dispersion (King and \n\nSmith, 1981), (Pelton et al., 1983, 1984), all of them implemented at the TEM-FAST 48 \n\ninversions sounding algorithms. \n\nFigure 2.27 \u2013 The IP effect responses from a two layered earth model. Cole-Cole dispersive \n\nrelation is applied to layers, with assigned values (adapted from AEMR, 2006). \n\n \n\nThe classical example of IP effect is shown in figure 2.27. It is the output of a 25 m coincident \n\nsingle square loop size, over a horizontal layered earth with a superficial resistivity of 30 \n\nohm.m and 5 m thick, over a 300 ohm.m half-space. Relaxation time is 100 \u00b5s, and c = 0.5. \n\nThree responses are given; a first one without any IP effect (? = 0%), a second with located \n\npolarizability at first layer (?1 = 2.5%) and a third one with polarizability at deep poorly \n\nconducting layer (?2 = 7.5%).  \n\n \n\nDistortion from shallow first layer is very significant, in spite of the fact that the thickness is \n\njust 5 m, and polarizability is rather small, compared with third response, were the \n\nobservable distortions are hardly appreciable. At this first layer IP effect response, the late \n\nstages of the process have a negative sign, the typical signature at these polarized \n\nenvironments. \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 40\n\nConclusions about the IP effect can be summarized as: \n\n \n\n- polarizing effect Eip(t) is proportional to time derivative from the transient characteristic of \n\nconductivity (~? ?\n\u00ee3?\n?\u00f0? ), \n- at any values of parameter c (0 \u00db c \u00dc 1) the Eip(t) sign signal is opposite to E0(t), and \nmonotonously decreases in time, \n\n- greatest speed of decrease at c = 1 (E\u00ce\u00e8?t? ~  ?eM\u00c9 \u00d0? ? and at 0 \u00db c \u00dc 1 is E\u00ce\u00e8?t? ~ ??? t? ?\u00f2K<, \n- at some polarization\u2019s parameters, the measured signal E?t?/I ? E\u00a5 \n E\u00ce\u00e8 can change sign \nat least twice, \n\n- polarizing signal Eip is proportional to R\n3\n, while induction signal E0 is proportional to R\n\n4\n, \n\n- with single coincident loop, the ratio E0/Eip is increased proportionally to the perimeter of the \n\nreceiving-transmitting antenna ~ R, \n\n- apparent resistivity curve ?(t) for different size of loop, have essentially different form, \n\n- sounding curves ?(t) and E(t), sharply change at rise of loop above the ground surface, \n\n- effect is minimal in the coincident loop configuration, \n\n- reduction of IP influence can be achieved by the increase of the loop size. The ratio of \n\ninduction and polarizing signals is proportional to the size of the coincident antenna ~ R. \n\n \n\nThe IP effects are frequently very hard diagnosed on the TEM data. Exceptions are cases \n\nwhen the very intense manifestations of the polarization, at low levels of induction processes, \n\nrepeatedly invert the sign of the observable signals. Cases occur when all observable signals \n\n(single coincident loop) from 4 \u00b5s to 4-10 ms time has a negative sign. Much more often the \n\npolarizing process just distorts measured sounding curve, without sign inversion of data \n\npoints. At interpretation in these cases, false poorly conducting horizons come to light \n\n(Barsukov et al., 2007). \n\n \n\nWith TEM-FAST 48 equipment, investigations have shown that most adverse interpretative \n\nsituations (in which IP effect takes place) arise with the following conditions (AEMR, 2006): \n\n \n\n- thin, well conducting horizon of subsurface clay deposits with electric resistivity smaller than \n\n20-40 ohm.m, over rather high resistive layer of rocks with 300-500 ohm.m. At polarization of \n\nfirst layer (? = 1 - 3%), late stages of transient will be IP deformed. \n\n- glaciers, permafrost rocks and superficial deposits intensively polluted with industrial \n\nwastes, (including petroleum pollution), \n\n- weathering cores in crystal rocks and fault zones. \n\n \n\nThe IP effect popup also at resistivities above 100 ohm.m when a significant polarizability \n\ndoes exist (? > 10%) and the time constant ??\u00ce\u00e8? spans a very wide range (1-1000 \u00b5s). As a \nlayer superficial effect, c is approximately unitary (E\u00ce\u00e8?t?~ ? eM\u00c9 \u00d0? ) and distortions are \nobserved in a narrow range of times. \"Deep\" IP effect is characterized by a c value around \n\n1/3 to 1/2, and distorts all the late stages of the signal. With the presence of IP in superficial \n\nand deep horizons of section, two negative minimums on early and late times are observed \n\nsimultaneously. \n\n \n\nIt is important to emphasise that since IP effect is linked to the presence of polarisable \n\nbodies (or fluids), it can thus be used in prospecting, tracing and monitoring those targets. \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 41\n\n2.7.2 \u2013 Antenna Polarization effect \n \n\nThe antenna polarization effect (APE) has been detected in TEM data soundings by many \n\nresearchers (Bishop and Reid, 2003). No explanation was given to this effect, until recently \n\n(Barsukov et al., 2003). In practice, the transient characteristics (or their time derivatives) \n\noften show a sign reversal (usually called \u201cnegative anomalies\u201d), which is solely due to the \n\nfrequency dependence of electric conductivity of rocks, as previously described. \n\n \n\nWith some TEM sounding\u2019s experimental data, discrepancies are often observed that do not \n\nfit theoretical models of polarizable media, and the negative anomaly\u2019s value depends on the \n\nresistivity of the loop wire (antenna). These differences between the experiment and theory \n\ncannot be explained by horizontal inhomogeneities of the studied medium or imperfection of \n\nmodelling technique (Bishop and Reid, 2003). \n\n \n\nDistributed antenna capacity and ever-persisting resistance in the devices employed in \n\ngeological media showing frequency-dependent dielectric permeability \u2013 produces the APE. \n\nThis effect manifests themselves at later stages of transient process and is detected as a \n\nslow time decaying process ~tM?\u00a5,?M\u00a5,\u00f7? with phase opposite to the induction transient \ncharacteristic phase. APE depends on the dispersion parameters of the medium at a fixed \n\ncurrent value; it is proportional to the squared resistivity value of the antenna (loop) wire, as \n\nthe plotted example at figure 2.28. APE is detected both with coincident (single) loop and \n\nwith all the offset (separated) antennas, and should be taken into account in the field data \n\ninterpretation (Barsukov et al., 2003 and 2007). \n\nFigure 2.28 \u2013 The APE dependency signal response on wire resistance. Coincident single loop \n\n(10 m \u00d710 m). Square points have negative values (adapted from Barsukov et al., 2007). \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 42\n\n \n\n2.7.3 \u2013 Superparamagnetic effects \n \n\nSuperparamagnetic (SPM) effect was studied by many researchers since last century, \n\nstarting with N\u00e9el\u2019s pioneering work (N\u00e9el 1949), followed by many more, directly connected \n\nto EM soundings (Nagata 1961, Averyanov 1965, Lee 1981, Buselli 1982, Barsukov and \n\nFainberg 2001, etc.). In some publications, SPM effect is also called by \u201ceffect of magnetic \n\nviscosity\u201d. \n\n \n\nSPM effect in rocky material is connected with the processes of orientation/disorientation of \n\nthe magnetic moments of very fine scale particles (10\n-10\n\n m order size) of magnetic minerals in \n\nthe initial moments of turn on/turn off of exciting magnetic field. The researches of SPM \n\neffects in various areas of the world with TEM-FAST (predecessor of actual TEM-FAST 48 \n\nsystem) between 1985 and 1998 have shown the following facts: \n\n \n\n- most intensive SPM effects exist in areas of effusive and volcanic-sedimentary rocks. \n\nSuperficial clay formations covering parent rocks are most superparamagnetic, \n\n- SPM effects take place in conditions of long-term permafrost and usually are located on the \n\nborder of zones of thawing frozen rocks, \n\n- significant SPM effects are observed on glaciers, \n\n- SPM is created, as a rule, by particles (radius of 10\n-9\n to 10\n\n-7\n m) of magnetite and \n\nmaghemite. In practice, a SPM effect in TEM is usually treated as frequency dispersion of \n\nthe rocks magnetic susceptibility, by analogy with frequency dispersion of conductivity (IP \n\neffect). The transient characteristic (reaction to step-type power off a magnetic field) of \n\nmagnetic susceptibility \u00f8s\u00f9\u00fa it is conveniently simulated as a relaxation model of SPM in \nTEM. \n\n \n\n    \u00f8s\u00f9\u00fa?\n? ?

(as already described taking ?G ? 1 s and ?&lt;? 1 \u00b5s). \n \n\nThe characteristic signature of SPM effect is the slow speed of the transient decay in time, \n\nwith E(t) ~ t\n-1\n. For induction processes, E(t) decreases not slower than ~ t\n\n-5/2\n, as described \n\nearly (expression 2.39). The usual identification of SPM in the TEM registered data is \n\nnormally done with a t.E(t) versus t plot, as the late stages of transient signal containing SPM \n\ncomponent, will show an almost constant behaviour in time (figure 2.29). In practice, \n\nbecause of different reasons the observable SPM processes decrease as E(t) ~ t\n-(1+?)\n\n , where \n\n?0,2 \u00db ? \u00db 0,2  (Barsukov and Fainberg, 2001). \n \n\nFor coincident circular antenna (with radius R), located at earth\u2019s surface and above a SPM \n\nhalf-space, SPM effect is described by the expression: \n\n \n\n    \u00fc?\n?/? ? 0\u00a5\u00f8s\u00f9\u00fa?\n?\u00fd    (2.62) \n \n\nand L is the antenna's inductance. \n  \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 43\n\nFigure 2.29 \u2013 Half earth model response without and with SPM effect from top layer, \n\n(k = 0.1 at 0.5-2.5 m depth influence). \n\n \n\nThe precise calculations of transient\u2019s response of horizontal layered conductive and SPM \n\nmedia, have shown, that the interaction of induction currents and SPM effects can be \n\nneglected, i.e. it is possible to consider these effects as purely additive. Reduction of SPM \n\neffect influencing TEM sounding data at the acquisition level is possible by doing the \n\nfollowing operations: \n\n \n\n- Reduce mutual inductance of antennas (M), when offset configuration is applied. Using two \n\nidentical antennas shifted at some distance, ensuring practically zero stream coupling \n\n(mutual inductance of antennas M), can provide 50-100 times suppression of SPM signal. \n\nHowever in real field conditions, applicability can be tricky, and it is rather time-consuming. \n\n- Increase the size of the coincident loop. \n\nThe signal in the coincident configuration is proportional to the square of the loop's area ~R\n4\n, \n\nwhile the SPM effect at small depth of bedding of magnetic layers, is proportional to size of \n\nantenna ~R. Thus, at the increase of the antenna's size from 50 to 100 m, the ratio between \n\n\"useful\" induction and \"harmful\" SPM effects will increase as a minimum at 8 times (~R\n3\n). \n\n- Uplift the coincident antenna above the surface of media. \n\nIf SPM effect to a soil layer is not too intensive (that\u2019s the case at 80% of situations) using \n\nsmall coincident antennas with a size not more than 50 m \u00d7 50 m is a rather effective way \n\nboth from the point of view of results, and from the point of view of minimization of work time. \n\nThe rising of a 25 m \u00d7 25 m loop antenna at 1 to 1.5 meters aboveground is easily realizable \n\nand allows a SPM effects reduction of 3 to 4 times. \n\n\n\nTEM METHOD \n_____________ \n\n 44\n\nFigure 2.30 \u2013 SPM effect with three different sizes square loop, over sedimentary \n\nrocks in permafrost conditions at Norilsk, Russia (adapted from AEMR, 2006). \n\n \n\nAt field acquisition, it is necessary to do analysis of registered data to control SPM signal \n\ndistortions and if necessary, change the antenna\u2019s configuration. This analyses is done \n\nunder the assumption that SPM distortions act at late stages of the process with E(t) ~ t\n-1\n. \n\nThe observed resistivity ??t?  sharply decreases to \"unreal low\" values and the apparent \nresistivity curves ?\u00b2?t? , on late times for different loop sizes, show parallel abruptly falling \ndown branches, like the given example at figure 2.30. The SPM effect can be taken, not as a \n\nharmful signal, but as useful information about researched media, which can be accessed \n\nwith different configurations of loops. It is also possible to measure SPM in rock samples at \n\nthe laboratory (or directly in-field conditions, using special portable sensors) (AEMR, 2006). \n\n\n\n45 \n\n3 \nTEM MODELLING THEORY \n\n \n\nThis third chapter presents an overview of TEM data modelling.

We have seen that with a loop source over a horizontal ground, \n\nthe only field transmitted in the TEM method is a transverse electric field (TE). Hence, only \n\nthe Schelkunoff scalar potential F is necessary for a derivation of the vertical magnetic field \n\nin the loop\u2019s centre. Under this one-dimensional (1D) layered earth assumption, potential F \n\nconsists of one component only, the z-component. The z-direction is the vertical (positive \n\ndownward), x and y defines the horizontal planes. The TE mode of this potential F is: \n\n \n\n    ? ? ???? ; TE\t    (3.1) \n \n\nwhere ?? is a scalar function of x, y and z (?? is the unit vector in the z-direction). TE\t denotes \nthe transverse electric field, which is the field propagating in the xy-plane. \n\n \n\nSubstituting expression (3.1) into chapter 2 equations (2.29) and (2.30) enables the \n\nexpression of the field components; \n\n \n\n   \n? ? ??\n ?2??????  ; ?? ? ? ????y    (3.2a) \n \n\n   \n? ? ??\n ?2??????  ; ?? ? ????x    (3.2b) \n \n\n   \n? ? ??\n ? ?2??2 ? ??? ?? ; ?? ? 0    (3.2c) \n \n\nFor a parallel plane 1D model consisting of source-free regions, as well as regions containing \n\nsources, the derived general Schelkunoff F potential has been written as an expression \n\n(2.31).

Knight and Raiche (1982), have found that for \n\ngreater numerical stability, this recursive relation works better if formulated with f,?IV instead \nof tanh Zg$. \n\nFigure 3.1 \u2013 Horizontal and parallel N-layered half-space earth, \n\nwith defined physical parameters at each layer. \n\n \n\nEquation (3.4) is expressed in the frequency domain (r01 is a function of frequency). The \nresponse in the time-domain (transient response), is obtained by inverse Laplace transform \n\nor inverse Fourier transform. The integral in (3.4) is called a Hankel integral. There is no \n\nanalytical solution for this integral, and it must be evaluated by numerical methods. That task \n\nis faster if digital filtering is applied, instead of just compute the numerical integration of the \n\nHankel transform (Bessel function decays slowly and set direct numerical integration to be a \n\ntime-consuming task). The integration function (3.4) is the product of two functions; Bessel \n\nfunction times a kernel function, the latter with model and signal information. An alternative \n\nmethod to Bessel function evaluation was given by Koefoed et al. (1972) by digital filtering. \n\nAnderson (1979) defines latter digital filters to this problem. The linear relation between the \n\nkernel function and the magnetic field is used. The magnetic field is given by linear filtering. \n\nWith this procedure, it\u2019s not necessary to re-compute the kernel function every time, \n\nspeeding numerical calculations. Applying the natural logarithmic transforms as stated by \n\nKoefoed et al. (1972), results into a convolution between the input function and output filter \n\nresponse. The input function can be taken as the adding of sinc functions. The output \n\nfunction is given by the integral adding of the sinc filter response. (Koefoed et al., 1972). The \n\nsinc filter spectrum response is the sinc spectrum times the filter spectrum. The final result is \n\ngiven by inverse Fourier transform of the sinc filter response. \n\n \n\nModelling TEM responses includes sometimes convolutions with low-pass filter, like specified \n\nby Effers\u00f8 et al., (1999) and turn-on and turn-off ramps effects (Fitterman and Anderson, \n\n1987). Each equipment has its own acquisition specifications, and those parameters must be \n\ntaken into account for a perfect modelling and comparison with field data. \n  \n\n\n\nTEM MODELLING THEORY \n________________________ \n\n 48\n\n3.1.1 \u2013 Forward 1D TEM response \n \n\nFor the N layer model, we have the usual 2N-1 number of model parameters, if we just take \n\nthe N layers electric conductivity and the N-1 layer\u2019s thickness, with permeability and \n\npermittivity equal to their free space values. With this parameters set, a response at the earth \n\nsurface can now be computed. \n\n \n\nThree models are presented at figure 3.2; a uniform half-space and two 3 layers models. The \n\nforward solution to these models is given at figure 3.3. It expresses basic different behaviour \n\nbetween a half-space to a layered one. The responses are for a single 50 m \u00d7 50 m square \n\nloop. \n\nFigure 3.2 \u2013 Uniform half-space (model 1) and three-layer models; one with a low-resistivity \n\nlayer embedded in a high-resistive background (model 2) and one with a high-resistivity \n\nlayer embedded in a low-resistivity background (model 3). \n\n \n\nThe emf signal offset between model 2 and model 1 response is greater than offset between \n\nmodels 3 and 1 response (figure 3.3a). Model 2 and 3 signals do not decay anymore with \n\nt\n-5/2\n\n. The apparent resistivity plot exhibit also great differences. The top layers definitely \n\nperturb the sounding curve, and no uniform half-space can represent this behaviour \n\nanymore. Regardless of these, later stages points converge asymptotically to the bottom \n\nlayer resistivity (figure 3.3b). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 plots the spatial current density at three different times after transmitter signal \n\nturn-off, for the same set of models. Only one side section of the current system is shown. \n\nFigure 3.4a) shows the current density in the homogeneous half space. For the 1D half-\n\nspace the current flows cylindrically and symmetrically around the vertical axis through the \n\ncentre of the transmitter loop. The current maximum moves downwards and outwards as \n\ntime passes. The current densities are normalized to the maximum value at that time giving \n\nthe same maximum amplitude in all plots. Although the real values are very different, with \n\nmaximum amplitude at time 10 \u00b5s some 10\n6\n times larger than at 1000 \u00b5s. The darker grey \n\nregions indicate larger current densities. \n\n \n\nFor model 2 (low-resistivity layer embedded in high-resistivity layers) at figure 3.4b) we see \n\nthat already at 100 \u00b5s after the turn-off of the current pulse, the maximum of the current \n\ndensity is located in the low-resistivity layer (layer 2). Later at 1000 \u00b5s the maximum stays in \n\n\n\nTEM MODELLING THEORY \n________________________ \n\n 49\n\nthat layer. Later at 1000 \u00b5s the maximum stays in that layer. When compared to the \n\nhomogeneous half-space (figure 3.4a), the low-resistivity layer interrupts the normal diffusion \n\npattern and acts as a shield for the high resistivity layer below. \n\nFigure 3.3 \u2013 Models response; a) emf current normalized signal, b) apparent resistivity, \n\nwith TEMRES software (AEMR) \n\nFigure 3.4 \u2013 Current density models response for; a) model 1, b) model 2, c) model 3. \n\n(Adapted from Christiansen et al, 2006)  \n\n\n\nTEM MODELLING THEORY \n________________________ \n\n 50\n\nFor model 3 (high-resistivity layer embedded in low-resistivity layers) at figure 3.4c) we see \n\nthat at 100 \u00b5s the current density exists and is divided between the top and the bottom \n\nlayers. The current density in the high-resistivity layer is very low. At 1000 \u00b5s the current \n\ndensity distribution is \u201centirely at the bottom layer skipping the high-resistivity layer\u201d in the \n\nmiddle. The implication to this is that the resulting sounding curve retains very limited \n\ninformation on this resistive layer. \n\n \n\nThese different responses put into evidence that TEM method is highly sensitive to low-\n\nresistivity layers (conductive layers) simply because a larger amount of the current flows in \n\nthese layers. The diffusion speed depends on the resistivity of the layers, i.e. the diffusion \n\nspeed is high for high-resistivity layers and low for low-resistivity layers, as given by \n\nexpression (2.27). \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2 \u2013 Inversion methods \n \n\nTo analyse the field data sounding curve, we need to compare it against an output curve \n\nfrom a give forward model result, for instance a 1D layer model. There are several schemes \n\nproposed for direct problem or approximate analysis of TDEM data, e.g. (Nekut, 1987), \n\n(Smith et al., 1994). Meju (1995) proposes a simple approximate scheme for electromagnetic \n\ndata analysis. The scheme for transforming TDEM apparent resistivity data into approximate \n\nresistivity-versus-depth information is an adaptation of the Niblett-Bostick transformation \n\nused in magnetotelluric data analysis (Bostick, 1977). \n\n \n\nIf the field and computed curves have a good match, then the suggested model is a \n\n(possible) model to explain the field data. This is a trial-and-error process that is a kind of \n\ninverse problem. Many techniques have been developed, and the underlying theory of the \n\ninverse problem is well described in the geophysical literature from several authors, e.g. \n\nJackson (1972 and 1979), Twomey (1977), Tarantola and Valette (1982), Menke (1984), \n\nConstable et al., (1987), Meju (1994a and 1994b), Parker (1994), Newman and Alumbaugh \n\n(1997), Scales et al. (2001), Tarantola (2005), Aster et al. (2005). \n\n \n\n3.2.1 \u2013 General data inversion \n \n\nKnowledge of the subsoil properties by data acquired on earth\u2019s surface is a typical case of \n\nthe inverse problem\u2019s geophysical applications. For a given set of model\u2019s parameters and \n\nvalues, response must fit the observed data at discrete points. This model is not unique and \n\nequivalence problems can exist. The number of solutions (models) is also enhanced by the \n\naddition of data errors. \n\n \n\nTo solve the inverse problem it\u2019s necessary to: \n\n \n\n1 - Parameterize the model, i.e. split the earth domain under study to discrete and uniform \n\nproprieties\u2019 regions. Assuming 1D models these are just thickness layers with some physical \n\nattributed parameters (resistivity or conductivity). At 2D we have cells and at 3D volumetric \n\ndefined blocks.  \n\n\n\nTEM MODELLING THEORY \n________________________ \n\n 51\n\n2 - Express a relation between the model parameters and observational data \u2013 direct \n\nproblem issue for the used array. \n\n \n\n3 - Apply a satisfactory method that finds the closest model response to observed data. At \n\nthis stage, two kinds of methodologies can be used; local and global search methodologies. \n\nThe local methods seek solutions from the start model. At the global one, solution search is \n\ndone at a wider solution space. The former can be the least-square adjustment and the later \n\nthe simulated annealing method. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.2 \u2013 Model parameterization \n \n\nThe complexity of a discrete model is a function of the given dimension. Any finite space h, \nwere some variable physical properties do exist, can be divided into a limited number of \n\ndiscrete geometric elements, with constant physical properties of each element. Taken the \n\nclassical 1D TEM approach, the physical property under study is the electric resistivity (?) \n\nand geometric thickness (h) of each horizontal layer. These comprise the m vector\u2019s \n\nparameter of the problem with M elements. \n\n \n\nBeing i j$ the functional relating model parameters to model response (direct problem), the \nmodel response over h space is then: \n \n\n    ) k l$mno p q k[lr]DrsP ? t   (3.11) \n \n\nWhere u is the data vector. \n\n \n\nThe corresponding matrix equation is: \n\n \n\n      t ? ?j    (3.12) \n \n\nand ? is the matrix relating the u data line matrix to the m parameters column matrix. \n \n\n \n\n3.2.3 \u2013 Least-square linear inverse problem \n \n\nWhen a linear relation prevails between u and m, when expression (3.12) can be written for \n\ndiscrete data and model regions: \n\n \n\n     ZK ? q ?KrlrDrsP     (3.13) \n \n\nIn reality, the collected data have always an associated error, leading to the impossibility of a \n\nmodel response to perfectly match it.

[3w3],?3w?   (3.27) \n \n\nand to each iterative step a new Jacobean matrix 3 must be calculated. New model is always \nfound from previous one. This iterative method is known as Gauss-Newton method (Meju, \n\n1998). \n\n \n\nThe method is simple and powerful, but can be tricky producing solutions with no physical \n\nmeaning when the 3w3 matrix is singular (or almost singular). That is, when eigenvalues are \nnear zero. When the 3w3 matrix is not singular, very slow convergence can take place or even \ndiverging situations, due to a wrong chosen starting model. To overcome this, any previous \n\ninformation \u2013 a priori information, like former processed data, logging data and geologic \n\nknowledge can be incorporated to have a better start model. \n\n\n\nTEM MODELLING THEORY \n________________________ \n\n 54\n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.5 \u2013 Smoothed inverse problems \n \n\nIt\u2019s possible to impose certain limitation to the m parameter values. That is done, for \n\ninstance, to 1D inversion, by fixing lower and higher limits to each of the electric resistivity \n\nand thickness layer\u2019s values. In 2D and 3D inversion, the assigned parameter values of each \n\ndomain cell or block element can be \u201cclosely\u201d related with the neighborhood ones by the \n\nroughness quantity. Smooth constrains methodology applications are published from various \n\nauthors like Constable et al. (1987), Sasaki (1989, 1992 and 1994), DeGroot-Hedlin and \n\nConstable (1990), Sasaki et al. (1992), Zhang and Hobbs (1992). \n\n \n\nA similar methodology for 1D inversion, taken into account nearby soundings to construct a \n\nquasi-2D pseudo-section, is known as Lateral Constrained Inversion (LCI), and has been \n\napplied over galvanic and EM data, (Auken et al., 2001, 2002 and 2005a), (Santos, 2004), \n\n(Auken and Christiansen, 2004), (Mansoor et al., 2006). Viezzoli et al., (2008) have \n\npresented a new methodology, Spatially Constrained Inversion (SCI), which produces quasi-\n\n3D modeling by taken into account not only soundings along a given profile, but also from \n\nacross profiles. \n\n \n\nThe roughness of the model parameters can be expressed as: \n\n \n\n      ? ? ?j    (3.28) \n \n\nwhere ? is the Laplacian roughening matrix. \n \n\nThe objective function Q, must now include not only the data misfit term (Q?) but the \nsmoothness one also (Q?). \n \n\n    Q ?

Too high ? value means a very \nsmooth model and a worse data fitting. Too low ? vanish with the smooth constrain. The \nusual procedure is to start with a relatively high ? value and diminish it throughout the \niteration process. \n\n \n\nWith this new formulation, the solution of the inversion using the linear approach becomes \n\n(Menke, 1989): \n\n \n\n    j ? [?w? ? ??wC],??wt    (3.30) \n \n\nand the parameters correction for the non-linear case are calculated by: \n\n \n\n    ? ? [3w3 ? ??wC],?3w?    (3.31) \n  \n\n\n\nTEM MODELLING THEORY \n________________________ \n\n 55\n\n \n\n3.2.6 \u2013 Matrix equations solving methods \n \n\nThere are several different methods to solve the (3.12) equation system. The conjugate \n\ngradient is an iterative method to search local minimum by gradient method analyses of \n\nminimizing function (Hestenes and Stiefel, 1952). Converging process ends by reaching a \n\npredefined limited number of steps or to a predefined misfit value. The implemented code \n\nalgorithm it\u2019s easily found in the literature, like Press et al. (1992). From this method, several \n\nothers do exist, e.g. the biconjugate gradient method. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe singular value decomposition (SVD) (or spectral decomposition) is an important \n\nfactorization method of a rectangular real (or complex) matrix. It\u2019s an excellent method to \n\nperform the least square\u2019s data fitting, and is nowadays most applied at geophysical data \n\nanalyses, because is mathematically robust and numerically stable giving also tools for \n\nanalyses of the model results. Applied computing SVD data methods back to the fifths of last \n\ncentury, and a detailed description is given by Lanczos (1958) and Jackson (1972). Today \n\nthe computing most-used code is the one from Golub and Reinsch (1970). The \n\ndecomposition of the matrix F is written as: \n\n \n\n     ? ? \u00a0\u00a1\u00a2w     (3.32) \n \n\nwhere \u00a0 is an orthogonal data space eigenvector matrix with the same dimension (m \u00d7 n as ?), \u00a1 is a diagonal matrix (n \u00d7 n) of nonnegative elements (singular values of ?, usually listed \nin descending order) and \u00a2 is a singular orthogonal parameters space eigenvector matrix (n \n\u00d7 n) (Meju, 1998), and: \n\n \n\n    \u00a0w\u00a0 ? \u00a2w\u00a2 ? \u00a2\u00a2w ? \u00a3    (3.33) \n \n\nwhere \u00a3 is the identity matrix. \n \n\nWhit this formulation, expression (3.17) becomes then; \n\n \n\n     j ? \u00a2\u00a1,?\u00a0wt    (3.34) \n \n\nand the damped equivalent expression (3.31) becomes; \n\n \n\n    j ? \u00a2[\u00a1( ? ??wC],?\u00a3\u00a1\u00a0wt    (3.35) \n \n\n \n\nThe advantage of the SVD is that it also gives the inversion statistics, with the importance \n\nvalue of each model parameter. A unitary importance means that parameter has strong \n\nimportance on the model\u2019s fit output, and a smaller value (near zero) means that parameter \n\nhas little influence on the model\u2019s fit (Strack, 1992). \n  \n\n\n\nTEM MODELLING THEORY \n________________________ \n\n 56\n\n \n\n3.2.7 \u2013 Simulated Annealing method \n \n\nThe Simulated Annealing (SA) it\u2019s a global minimization method (Monte Carlo class), with the \n\nability to lock for the solution over a wider solution space. The process is similar, and its \n\nname comes from the annealing in metallurgy, a technique involving heating and controlled \n\ncooling of a material to reorient internal particles and reduce their defects. This method is \n\ncontrolled by the initial temperature (T0 > 0 and generally high) and cooling rate of T. With a \n\nhigh-temperature value the model parameters are allowed to have a greater variability (like \n\nkinetic energy of the particles in the metal), but as temperature drops those values freezes \n\naround the absolute minimum of it. To avoid falling at a local minimum, even with a rise in the \n\nobjective function, a comparison is made between the acceptance probably function, defined \n\nas: \n\n \n\n      \u00a4 ? u ,\u00a5? w? $    (3.36) \n \n\nand a generated random number \u00a6 (between 0 and 1). ?E is the objective function variation. \nIf \u00a8 \u00a9 \u00a6 then the variation of the parameters is accepted. This is the basis of the Metropolis \nalgorithm proposed at Metropolis et al. (1953). From (3.36) equation we see when T is high \n\n(at beginning) almost all variations are taken, but with low T the chance to be accepted is \n\nless and less probable. Application and introduction of this process in the framework of \n\ninverse theory was done by Rothman (1985a, 1985b, 1986). \n\n \n\nTo be efficient, the cooling temperature rate must be small, to allow a correct search over the \n\nmodel parameters\u2019 space (which is normally limited). But if this is too small, and if initial T is \n\nalso too high, we get a long computing time. With this method, and because the process is \n\nrandomly established, each run output a different model. The final model is usually \n\ncalculated from the analysis of several runs (e.g. 10) to check coherency between all of \n\nthem. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.8 \u2013 Joint inversion method \n \n\nThe acquired geophysical data over the earth have the signature of the structures beneath it, \n\nand each method sample only some physiochemical state of geological and/or man-made \n\ntargets. Upon this, conclusions can be drawn about the structures. However, each applied \n\nmethod as its own practical and theoretical limitations. For instance, no single conductivity \n\nsounding technique provides complete, consistent and sufficient data to characterize \n\ncompletely the subsurface. Moreover, the effectiveness of each technique varies from one \n\ngeological environment to another, as the various measurements\u2019 sets are influenced \n\ndifferently by the presence of small-sized three-dimensional bodies in the very near-surface \n\n(Meju, 2005). \n\n \n\nWhen different sets of geophysical data do exist from the same area, taken with different \n\nmethodologies or techniques, a joint inversion can be done if they share some (or not) \n\ncommon physical propriety. The resulting model\u2019s parameters must give a good solution \n\n\n\nTEM MODELLING THEORY \n________________________ \n\n 57\n\nreplicating the different data sets. There are basically two approaches to the joint inversion \n\nproblem. The first one is the structural approach, where the inversion seeks for a common \n\nstructure of the models. In the second one the inversion seeks for values of parameters that \n\nare related through empirical relationships. For example, the joint inversion of seismic and \n\nresistivity data can only be done using the structural approach (Gallardo and Meju, 2003 and \n\n2004).The parametric approach is commonly used with electromagnetic and electrical \n\nresistivity data. In this case, both the geometry (thickness) and resistivity values are taken as \n\nparameters into the inversion process. The integration of these data (e.g. DC and TEM) can \n\nimprove the robustness of model interpretation and the cumulative probability of detection of \n\nsubsurface targets. Several authors have developed joint inversion with DC resistivity, \n\nmagnetotelluric (MT) and TEM data, e.g. Vozoff and Jupp (1975), Jupp and Vozoff (1977), \n\nMeju (1996), Harinarayana (1999). \n\n \n\nThe 1D joint inverse problem can be accomplished by the use of a least-square criterion with \n\nSVD as a solving method (sections 3.2.4 and 3.2.6) or by SA approach (section 3.2.7.). \n\nConcerning the DC and TEM joint inversion, besides the parameters\u2019 calculation, attention \n\nmust be taken also to the well know \u201cstatic shift\u201d effect of the DC data. This effect arises from \n\nsmall-scale irregularities around the source and readings\u2019 electrodes, and gives a constant \n\n(logarithmic) resistivity shift to the same aperture MN/2 segment data (DC soundings). That \n\ncan be known and corrected comparing the TEM and DC apparent resistivity curves. To \n\nperform such comparison, we can use the empirical relation from Meju (2005) in order to plot \n\nthem together: \n\n \n\n      t ? \u00aaM.\u00abQ?\u00ac     (3.37) \n \n\nwith t the transient time (in s) and L the half electrode-array length (AB/2 distance, in m). \n\n \n\nSometimes TEM data soundings\u2019 acquisition is exclusively used to quantify and correct the \n\nstatic shift over DC and MT data sets. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.9 \u2013 Lateral and spatially constrained joint TEM inversion \n \n\nThe joint inversion of nearby soundings, usually stitched-together along a profile, was \n\noriginally developed for inverting continuous DC data sets (S\u00f8rensen, 1996). The 1D-LCI \n\ntechnique, already mentioned at 3.2.5 section, uses sharp layer boundaries and solves a \n\nnumber of 1D problems simultaneously with constraints between neighboring models. The \n\nlimitations are that it requires all separate 1D models have the same model parameters\u2019 \n\nsubset, and it works best at environments with relatively smooth lateral resistivity variations, \n\nlike sedimentary areas. All the models and the corresponding data sets are inverted \n\nsimultaneously; minimizing a common object function (Auken and Christiansen, 2004) \n\nthereby creating a quasi-2D image from a 1D based forward solution. The lateral constraints \n\nand constraints from a-priori information are all part of the data vector together with the \n\nmeasured apparent resistivity data. Due to the lateral constraints\u2019 algorithm, the model \n\nparameter\u2019s information will spread smoothly to the neighbours models so the parameters in \n\nthose near models have to be equal within certain limits.  \n\n\n\nTEM MODELLING THEORY \n________________________ \n\n 58\n\nAuken and Christiansen (2004) have also introduced the 2D-LCI algorithm. It uses the same \n\nformulation as the 1D-LCI inversion scheme, but the difference is that the forward model is \n\n2D. This means that 2D formulation can handle larger lateral variations in the subsurface \n\nresistivity. With the 1D-LCI method approach, inversion of TEM data in a 3D environment is \n\npossible. Studies show that if the geological environment consists of gently varying 3D \n\nstructures with moderate resistivity contrasts, the 1D inversion approach in most cases will \n\ngive a good recovery of the true model. When environments with high-resistivity contracts \n\nand strong 3D features exist the 1D based inversion algorithm is strongly influenced by 3D \n\neffects and will in many cases provide unreliable models. These 3D structures\u2019 effects in 1D \n\ninterpretation of TEM data have been dealt by; e.g. Newmann et al, (1987), Goldman et al. \n\n(1994), Auken (1995), H\u00f6rdt and Scholl (2004) and Auken et al. (2008). \n\n \n\nThe quasi-3D inversion, the mathematical formulation of the SCI method is very similar to \n\nthat of the LCI method (Auken and Christiansen, 2004). It is a least-squares inversion of a \n\nlayered earth regularized through spatial constraints, which gives the smoothed lateral \n\ntransitions. Main difference between the SCI and LCI methodologies are the entries in the \n\nroughening matrix ?. In SCI, the constraints are also applied to offline soundings so each \nmodel parameter is connected to many other model parameters of the same kind, not only to \n\nneighboring along-line soundings. Nevertheless, in both LCI and SCI, ? is sparse. Another \nmajor difference is that over the spatial domain, the constraining points have to follow a \n\nDelaunay triangulation (Viezzoli et al., 2008). \n\n \n\nUpon this SCI methodology, a spatially constrained 1D inversion algorithm for quasi-3D TEM \n\nresponse was tested over synthetic data models. The algorithm code was implemented by \n\nFernando Santos (personal communication) and details are given at Santos et al. (2011), \n\nSantos and El-Kaliouby (2011). The forward 1D calculation is based on the single loop \n\nconfiguration for a layered earth (Raiche, 1984). Care was taken to accurately calculate the \n\nearly times\u2019 response and this forward TEM algorithm account for the ramp time effect. The \n\ndata are the logarithms of the apparent resistivity values (versus time) at sounding\u2019s sites. \n\nThe model parameters are the resistivity logarithms of the hexahedral model blocks beneath \n\neach sounding measurement site. The block thickness increases to depth following an \n\nexponentially rule, with an initial value (Z0) and an increase factor (step) given by: \n\n \n\n     ;Hf\u00ad\u00ae\u00af\u00b0 W,P$ m    (3.38) \n \n\nto the n\nth\n thickness layer. The number of layers (vertical blocks) is chosen by user. \n\n \n\nThe minimization of an appropriate objective function allows the estimation of the corrections \n\nto the model parameters at each iteration. At this code, the defined objective function is: \n\n \n\n   Q ? ?\u00a1\u00b1 ?\u00b1 ? 3?\u00b3$?( ? ??? \u00b3 ? \u00b3%$?(   (3.39) \n \n\nwhere \u00a1\u00b1 is a diagonal matrix, consisting of the reciprocal of data error standard deviations, ?\u00b1 is the vector of the differences between the logarithms of the apparent resistivity of the \ncalculated model responses and of the observed measured data, 3 is the Jacobian (derivative \nmatrix) containing the derivatives of the model responses with respect to the model \n\n\n\nTEM MODELLING THEORY \n________________________ \n\n 59\n\nparameters, ?\u00b3 is the vector containing the corrections to the model parameters, and \u00b3% is \nthe a priori defined model. Damping factor ? it is set (empirically) at beginning and decreased \nby a factor of 0.8 at each iteration. The elements of the matrix ? are the roughness \ncoefficients of each parameter (block resistivity); defined in terms of the neighbor\u2019s proximity. \n\nMinimization of expression (3.39) yields the normal equations: \n\n \n\n  ?\u00b3 ? [3w\u00a1\u00b1w\u00a1\u00b13 ? ??wC],? 3w\u00a1\u00b1w\u00a1\u00b1?\u00b1 ? ??w? \u00b3 ? \u00b3%$$  (3.40) \n \n\nAfter solving this equations set, the model parameters \u00b3 are then updated by adding the \nvector ?\u00b3. The iteration procedure continues until the misfit is reduced to an acceptable level \n(user defined) or an iteration limit number is reached. \n\n \n\nFirstly, over the inversion of data acquired over a uniform 10 ohm.m resistivity half-space \n\nwas tested. Apparent resistivity TEM curve response was computed for a single 25 m \u00d7 25 m \n\nside square loop sounding (figure 3.5). The numbers of soundings were set to 5; one at each \n\ncorner of a 100 m side square and at its centre. This response curve was decimated to just \n\n21 data points, from 5.07 \u00b5s to 7.65 ms time. The number of layers to be inverted was 15. \n\nShallow layer was set to 2 m (Z0) and the incremental step to 0.121. \n\n \n\nThe computed outcome, from an initial damping factor of 2.0 and stopping criteria of 40 \n\nmaximum convergence iteration or 0.02 model to data misfit error, it\u2019s below at figures 3.5 \n\nand 3.6. All the computed five soundings 1D quasi-3D models are equal (as they had started \n\nfrom the same model and data set). \n\nFigure 3.5 \u2013 Synthetic apparent resistivity data points and model inversion response, \n\nto 10 ohm.m uniform half-space model. \n\n \n\nTo quantify the misfit between the true model and the quasi-3D inversion calculated model, a \n\nmeasure root-mean-squared (rms) misfit error is defined: \n\n \n\n    c ? \u00b4 P?,Y q \u00b5\u00ac\u00b6?,\u00ac\u00b7?\u00ac\u00b6? \u00b8??KsP \u00b9\nP ?? \u00ba 100%  (3.41) \n\n \n\n\n\nTEM MODELLING THEORY \n________________________ \n\n 60\n\nwith ?oi the observed apparent resistivity M data points and ?ci are the computed apparent \n\nresistivity model response, were N is the number of model parameters to fit. \n\n \n\nFor this first test, the initial starting model was set uniform with 20 ohm.m. The difference \n\nbetween the computed model and the true model is high, 29.6% (after 21 iterations). Half this \n\nmisfit value comes from the last layer. With this inversion methodology, all models are to be \n\ngreatly smoothed when compared against usual 1D inversion, as the fixed layers\u2019 depth \n\ninhibits sharp and high resistivity contrast layers. \n\nFigure 3.6 \u2013 Inversion model against true model (corresponding to figure 3.5 data). \n\n \n\nNext step was to recovery the resistivity values for a three-layer model with the same TEM \n\ngeometry (see Table 3.1). The two tested models decrease their resistivity values with depth. \n\nFigure 3.7 shows the responses of those models. \n\n \n\nTable 3.1 \u2013 Test model2 and model3 parameters settings. \n\nModel Layer Resistivity / ohm.m Thickness / m \n\nmodel2 \n\n1 100 10 \n\n2 20 20 \n\n3 5 ? \n\nmodel3 \n\n1 50 10 \n\n2 10 30 \n\n3 2 ? \n\n \n\nThe starting model was again set uniform to 20 ohm.m with the same 15 layers and initial \n\ndamping factor equal to 2.0. The difference between the calculated model and the true one is \n\n16.6% (14 iterations) and 39.7% (27 iterations), respectively to model2 and model3. Model3 \n\nmisfit drops to 18.4% if the second layer is not accounted for (figure 3.8). All five soundings \n\ncalculated from the models are accordingly equal and fit well the data. With the layer \n\nthickness increased a better step and contrast response is achieved. The last layer resistivity \n\nvalue is very well established for these two test models.  \n\n\n\nTEM MODELLING THEORY \n________________________ \n\n 61\n\nFigure 3.7 \u2013 Synthetic apparent resistivity data points and model inversion response, \n\nto model2 and model3 test, (Table 3.1). \n\nFigure 3.8 \u2013 Inversion models against true models, for a) model2 and b) model3, \n\n(corresponding to figure 3.7 data). \n\n \n\nThe fourth model test has a dipping initial layer. 1D models beneath TEM soundings 1 and 2 \n\nare designed as model4a, beneath TEM sounding 3 as model4b and beneath TEM \n\nsoundings 4 and 5 as model4c, as described at Table 3.2 and presented at figure 3.9, with \n\nthe same size loops.

The fifth quasi-3D \n\ntest was done with the same previous settings, but adding a maximum 5% random noise to \n\neach TEM data sounding. The quasi-3D pair models\u2019 TEM 1 and 2 results are much alike \n\nand similar to the model than those from earlier test (figure 3.12).

After the same 30 iterations, the difference between true and \n\ncalculated models is 18.9% and 19.3%, for TEM 4 and 5 respectively. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.14 \u2013 Inversion models against true models, for a) TEM 4 and model4c, \n\nb) TEM 5 and model4c. \n\n \n\nThese tests showed that the quasi-3D algorithm successfully recovers the existing resistivity \n\nstructure with 20% error level, just starting with an initial uniform half-space resistivity model. \n\nThe higher number of model layers greatly smoothes the resistivity contrast results, as \n\nexpected. The resistivity of the last layer is usually very well calculated at all tested models. \n\n\n\n \n\n65 \n\n4 \nTEM-FAST 48 TESTS \n\n \n\nOn this chapter, the TEM-FAST 48 equipment and some software are tested over a known \n\nconductive environment where DC geoelectric soundings have also been acquired. Results \n\nare compared between each method and with seismic profiles. Joint inversion of TEM with \n\nVES (Vertical Electric Sounding) and TEM to VES data conversion was also tested. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.1 \u2013 Test site description \n \n\nTo test the TEM-FAST 48 equipment system a wide open and flat land space was chosen, at \n\nthe Lower Tagus Cenozoic Basin (LTCB). It is a tectonic depression filled with Cenozoic \n\nsediments that hosts the lower reach of the Tagus River which flows along the Lower Tagus \n\nValley (LTV), figure 4.1. \n\nFigure 4.1 - Test site location. \n\nSynthetic geological onset description of LTCB (adapted from Sim\u00f5es, 1998). \n\n \n\n\n\nTEM-FAST 48 TESTS \n___________________ \n\n 66\n\n \n\n4.1.1 \u2013 Test site geologic description \n \n\nThe test site geology is characterized by recent (plisto-holocenic and quaternary) \n\nsedimentary deposits of yellowish gravel with intercalated grey clay and an expected \n\nthickness of 60-70 meter (figure 4.2). Above this we have recent soil and silt filling in the \n\nmany natural and man-made channels that drain the water from these flat and low lands (2 to \n\n3 m above the Tagus river water surface). Bellow these initial formations are 150 m thickness \n\npliocenic yellow and whitish coarse sandy with rubble and small brown clay intrusion, \n\nfollowed by the miocenic one composed by shells limestone sandstone. Miocenic formation \n\nattains some 200-400 m thickness in the southwest part of the basin. \n\nFigure 4.2 - Well locations and available logs in the Porto Alto area (at northeast of test area), drilled \n\nfor water supply. a: Holocene; P - Pleistocene; N - Neogene. Profiles locations are also shown. \n\n(Adapted from Carvalho et al., 2006). \n\n \n\nThe underground water free level is very near the surface, some 0.5 to 1 m depth. This \n\ngroundwater is highly conductive because all the area is under estuarine water influence, a \n\nmixture of fresh waters from the river and Atlantic ocean salty water. The measured water \n\nelectric conductivity value at the surface drainage channels was 9300 \u00b5S.cm\n-1\n (1.08 ?.m) at \n\n20 \u00baC. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2 \u2013 Test field work \n \n\nThe locations of the TEM and VES soundings are given at figure 4.3. They were conducted \n\nover three nearby and parallel north-30-east profiles. The centres of VES arrays are \n\ncoincident with TEM square loop centres. The VES array direction is also along the profile\u2019s \n\norientation. TEM single square loops are 50 m \u00d7 50 m and loops centre are contiguous 25 m \n\napart each other. Profile PA3 comprises 16 TEM soundings. Profiles PA4 and PA5 have both \n\n10 TEM soundings. Over each profile, five VES have been done, also spaced by 25 m. \n\nWestwards the PA5 profile is 50 m apart from PA4 profile (at the west side of the country \n\nroad), and the latter is 85 m from the eastern PA3 profile (at the east side of the road). The \n\nfieldwork was conducted during 2005 summer\u2019s beginning; with a dry soil condition (2005 \n\nwas a very dry year in Portugal). \n\n \n\n\n\nTEM-FAST 48 TESTS \n___________________ \n\n 67\n\nAll these profiles have been done coincident with seismic lines, named PA3 to PA5 (Porto \n\nAlto), acquired in a previous work concerning the application of high-resolution seismic \n\nreflection method to detection near-surface faulting in two major tectonic structures at Tagus \n\nValley (Carvalho et al., 2006). At that time, VES with larger AB/2 distances were also \n\nacquired nearby the seismic profiles. \n\n \n\nThe region is a wild life protected area, but many places are still mainly used to bovine cattle \n\nproduction, and the land is usually grass covert. Some of these wide areas have metallic \n\nfences stacked to the ground by wood pools. That was the situation at the tested place, with \n\na border fence along each side of the road. The nearest high-power transmission lines are \n\nfar way, 10 km north and also 8 km to the west. \n\nFigure 4.3 \u2013 VES (yellow circles) and TEM (white squares) soundings disposition at the field. \n\nNorth is up at this image (adapted from Google images). \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2.1 \u2013 VES data \n \n\nThe VES data acquisition followed the traditional and standard field procedure for the \n\nSchlumberger array. Field equipment belongs to the Geophysics Group (Lisbon Science \n\nFaculty), and it is self-made equipment. Current electrode separation (AB/2) varied from 1 m \n\n\n\nTEM-FAST 48 TESTS \n___________________ \n\n 68\n\nup to 200 m, giving eight apparent resistivity values per logarithmic decade. The measured \n\nelectric potential (MN) was done with the gradual step spreading, from 0.5 m to 8 m. The \n\nVES soundings\u2019 data (apparent resistivity) are shown in figure 4.4. \n\nFigure 4.4 \u2013 VES sounding curves data points at each profile, apparent resistivity versus depth (AB/2). \n\n \n\nThe VES curves are of the H type, starting at a mean apparent resistivity value of 3-5 ?.m, \n\ndecreasing to mean value of 0.6-0.8 ?.m and increasing afterwards to higher apparent \n\nresistivities. The last couple points exhibit greater experimental errors, at 20% order. With \n\nthese low apparent resistivity values, effective depth of investigation is much less than real \n\nAB/2 distances, as most current density flows and stays at the near surface. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2.2 \u2013 VES data modelling \n \n\n1D inversion of the VES data was done with the classical horizontal layers\u2019 inversion tools. \n\nThe forward problem is solved calculating the electric field created by a point source over a \n\nhomogeneous and isotropic horizontal layer earth (Stefanesco et al. 1930). The digital \n\nfiltering theory (Ghosh, 1971a, 1971b) is applied to relate the apparent resistivity to the \n\nresistivity transform as defined by Koefoed (1970, 1979). In this way, the apparent resistivity \n\nresponse of a model (with specific layer\u2019s resistivity and thickness) is computed. \n\n \n\nThe inversion problem is solved as stated at previous section (3.2), by the SVD method. The \n\nstarting model to initiate the process is taken from the asymptotic analyses of the data field \n\ncurve. From all possibilities, the simpler (fewer number of layers) model is chosen. At some \n\nVES, the misfit of the five layers model was the smallest, but the corresponding geoelectric \n\nmodel makes nonsense when compared with the surrounding ones. At this level, we are just \n\nmodelling the noise data features, as higher scattering is present at the last VES data points. \n\nThe number of the layer that best satisfy all VES data is four. The observed shift between \n\ndifferent constant MN segments is smaller, and correction was made to the initial MN branch. \n\nVES curves are similar, but a slight shift does exist among them. \n  \n\n\n\nTEM-FAST 48 TESTS \n___________________ \n\n 69\n\n \n\nThe four layer models with the best fit are shown in figures 4.5 to 4.7. Minimum and \n\nmaximum equivalent models were also computed. The mean values of the parameters and \n\ntheir bound\u2019s errors (Raiche et al. 1985) are included in Tables 4.1 to 4.3. These Tables \n\ninclude also the computed root-mean-squared misfit error between the observed and \n\ncomputed apparent resistivity data, defined previously by the expression (3.31). \n\n \n\nTable 4.1 \u2013 PA3 profile VES models parameters; value, variation and global misfit result. \n\nLayer VES 1 VES 2 VES 3 VES 4 VES 5 \n\n1 ?a / ?.m 10.5 \u00b1 2.0 35.7 \u00b1 4.3 3.0 \u00b1 1.2 6.8 \u00b1 0.5 3.6 \u00b1 0.4 \n\n2 ?a / ?.m 0.57 \u00b1 0.02 0.57 \u00b1 0.01 0.53 \u00b1 0.01 0.38 \u00b1 0.01 0.48 \u00b1 0.01 \n\n3 ?a / ?.m 1.4 \u00b1 0.1 1.5 \u00b1 0.1 2.0 \u00b1 0.1 1.3 \u00b1 0.1 1.3 \u00b1 0.2 \n\n4 ?a / ?.m 4.7 \u00b1 0.2 4.5 \u00b1 0.1 4.2 \u00b1 0.1 6.0 \u00b1 0.3 3.7 \u00b1 0.2 \n\n1   h / m 0.30 \u00b1 0.01 0.25 \u00b1 0.01 0.70 \u00b1 0.07 0.34 \u00b1 0.01 0.42 \u00b1 0.02 \n\n2   h / m 3.1 \u00b1 0.3 3.9 \u00b1 0.2 3.4 \u00b1 0.2 3.1 \u00b1 0.2 3.8 \u00b1 0.5 \n\n3   h / m 17.7 \u00b1 1.9 21.6 \u00b1 1.7 25.7 \u00b1 1.8 21.8 \u00b1 1.5 16.5 \u00b1 3.0 \n\nmisfit  / % 8.97 6.60 5.65 7.23 6.08 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.5 \u2013 PA3 profile VES models.

That is also true \n\nfor the last but one layer thickness (fifth one), were a T-equivalence do exist between layers\u2019 \n\nparameters. This fifth layer thickness is related to the last layer resistivity values that come \n\nfrom less quality data points (late time points with low SNR). \n\n \n\nThe bottom of fourth layer with mean depth of about 35, 42 and 35 meters, at PA3, PA4 and \n\nPA5 profiles respectively, match the Quaternary base position taken from the seismic data. \n\nAll the TEM models show also a low resistivity contrast between layer three and layer four. \n\nThis interface exhibits a mean position value of 15.8, 22.2 and 24.8 meters, at PA3, PA4 and \n\n\n\nTEM-FAST 48 TESTS \n___________________ \n\n 80\n\nPA5 profiles respectively. This finding agrees very well with the interpretation of the reflection \n\nseismic data from profiles PA3 to PA5, where the interface mean position is placed at 17, 20 \n\nand 23 meters depth, respectively, as seen in figure 4.22. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.22 \u2013 Refraction interpretation of the reflection seismic data from profiles PA3 to PA5. \n\nInterface letters represent emerging rays from the respective surface shot. P-wave velocities are \n\nindicated for each layer. Also shown are the locations of the VES and TEM soundings over the \n\nseismic profiles. (Adapted from Carvalho et al., 2006). \n\n \n\n \n\nWith these few seismic P-wave velocity values, it\u2019s impossible to properly quantify the \n\nrelationship between velocity to electric resistivity relation, as stated e.g. by Meju et al. \n\n(2003) and references therein. The common link is that resistivity and velocity are both \n\nfunctions of porosity. At present situation, one can conclude that the resistivity is more \n\nuniform in shallow layers than in the deeper one. These resistivity values of the deepest layer \n\ndecrease from profile PA3 (east) to profile PA5 (west side), along with increasing deep. The \n\nexplanation is a change of the stratigraphic unit parameters from east to west, namely the \n\nclay content, having upper layers higher porosity. TEM method performs a volumetric \n\nintegration response and it smoothes all the small-scale and small contrast geologic \n\nvariations. As a consequence, the perfect match between TEM models and seismic data is \n\nnot achieved. The latter is only affected by ray path and lateral velocity variations. \n  \n\n\n\nTEM-FAST 48 TESTS \n___________________ \n\n 81\n\n4.3 \u2013 TEM versus VES comparison \n \n\nThe models from VES and TEM soundings are roughly the same, although with few \n\ndifferences, especially between profiles, as exposed in tables 4.4 and 4.8 .VES gives better \n\nsolution to the very shallow first layers, and TEM a better resolution to the small variations \n\nbetween low resistivity layers. Figure 4.23 shows the resistivity cross-section and figure 4.24 \n\nthe side by side collocated VES and TEM models. \n\n \n\nProfile PA3 - Both models give similar resistivity values for the bottom layer. The major \n\ndifferences are at the thickness of two first layers (as stated before) and VES third layer \n\ndepth interface position which is approximately in the middle of the fourth TEM layer. The \n\nresistivity of the third VES layer matches that one calculated from TEM data for the third \n\nlayer at most of the sites. \n\n \n\nProfile PA4 - At this profile the same pattern is seen, but resistivity values seem to be \n\nsomewhat shifted. \n\n \n\nProfile PA5 - The major difference between this profile and the previous two profiles is that \n\nthe interface position of the third layer calculated from VES is approximately the same of \n\nfourth TEM layer. This has to do with resistivity contrast between third and fourth TEM layers, \n\nas fourth layer resistivity value is in-between more resistive upper and lower layers. \n\nFigure 4.23 \u2013 TEM resistivity profiles cross-section with superimposed VES models. \n\nCross-sections stitched-together output from AEMR software.  \n\n\n\nTEM-FAST 48 TESTS \n___________________ \n\n 82\n\nFigure 4.24 \u2013 VES and TEM models plot at each sounding place.  \n\n\n\nTEM-FAST 48 TESTS \n___________________ \n\n 83\n\nIt seems clear that over this geologic sedimentary environment, with high conductive electric \n\nlayers, TEM method as the ability to detect interfaces between layers with small contrast very \n\nnear the surface (at half one of the loop sides). Closer to the surface, where the loop is laid \n\ndown, the method detects low resistivity layers, but it\u2019s impossible to ascribe a correct \n\nthickness to them. These findings are in accordance with technical descriptions and \n\nspecifications of TEM-FAST 48. Equipment\u2019s manual states that investigation depth, with an \n\nL side square single loop, ranges from L/10 to 3L below the surface (AEMR, 2006). With a \n\nloop 50 m \u00d7 50 m this will correspond from 5 m to 150 m. \n\n \n\nThe upper limit it\u2019s confirmed with this test data. If a better resolution is intended at the \n\nshallow surface, we have just to decrease the loop size. \n\n \n\nThe lower limit is not fulfilled although the last layer\u2019s model (sixth layer) is within the \n\n\u201ctheoretical limit\u201d. However, the last data points\u2019 quality does not clearly support it. That can \n\nbe explained by the loop low magnetic moment input signal. Loop\u2019s current stays always \n\naround 1,4 A, below the possible equipment\u2019s maximum of 4 A. Being so, the lower limit is in \n\nthe L to 2L range at present situation test. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3.1 \u2013 Resistivity static shift \n \n\nThe DC resistivity method values could be affected by an offset, called electric static shift (or \n\ngalvanic distortion). This is due to the presence of small-scale heterogeneities, near the \n\nground surface at the sounding place. The result is a distorted or shifted curve (e.g. Barker \n\n1981; Bahr 1991; Spitzer 2001) and that must be (when possible) accounted before \n\ninterpretation. If not, it will lead to erroneous interpretations, especially at resistivity values. \n\n \n\nTo have the quantitative static shift value, a scaling relationship between the spatial (VES) \n\nand temporal (TEM) sounding configurations must be applied. That relation is given by Meju \n\n(2005), as: \n\n \n\n     ? ? ????? 2?      (4.1a) \n \nor \n \n\n     ? ? 711,8???     (4.1b) \n \n\nwith t the transient time (in seconds) and L the one-half electrode-array length (AB/2). \n\nMaterial\u2019s magnetic permeability is taken to be equal to that of free-space. \n\n \n\nThose relations were applied to collocated VES and TEM data, as plotted at figure 4.25. As it \n\ncan be seen, most of the VES soundings present any or meaningless static shift, namely at \n\nprofile PA3, but several ones are notoriously shifted against the TEM data scaled values. \n\nContiguous VES 5 and 1 at profile PA4, and also contiguous VES 3, 4 and 5 at profile PA5 \n\nexhibit an upper and non negligible shift. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nTEM-FAST 48 TESTS \n___________________ \n\n 84\n\n \nFigure 4.25 \u2013 Apparent resistivity VES and TEM scaled data, at each profile sounding position. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3.2 \u2013 TEM \u2013 VES joint inversion \n \n\nThe VES and TEM soundings\u2019 data were modelled all together with a spatially constrain \n\ninversion (SCI) method, based on the algorithm mention at previous chapter.

That\u2019s the main goal of most hydrogeophysical studies. \n\nEstimation of subsurface porosity and hydraulic conductivity is often the primary objective at \n\nwater-saturated environments. The usual difficulty arises by the fact that hydraulic \n\nconductivity at geologic formations can span\u2019s orders of magnitude over relatively small \n\nspatial scales. It is then a challenge to accurately characterize the subsurface aquifer \n\nproperties by just working piecewise information from networks of widely spaced boreholes \n\nor at worse cases only a few ones. \n\n \n\nA more accurate and complete underground characterization can be achieved by using an \n\nintegrated exploration approach in which wells, boreholes and geophysical data sets are \n\ninterpreted together. The necessary key step is the transformation of measured geophysical \n\nproperties into the desired hydrogeological parameters, not only qualitatively but especially \n\nquantitatively. This conversion typically relies on petrophysical relationships. These \n\nrelationships can be developed at the field-scale level, by co-located hydrogeological-\n\ngeophysical data sets or through laboratory experimentation over rock and soil samples. It \n\ncan come also from theoretically based models. \n\n \n\nHowever, even with joint analyses, the generic hydrogeophysical site characterization can be \n\na difficult problem. The subsurface geology may contain much localized features such as \n\nweathered areas, bedding planes, bedrock, faults, joints and fracture zones, in addition to \n\ncontinuously distributed textural and composite variations. This gives rise to an expected \n\nmultiscale complexity, and the geological medium can be viewed like a discrete hierarchy \n\n(Vogel et al., 2002), were different length scales possess different patterns of spatial \n\nvariability and correlation or like a fractal (Mandelbrot, 1988), in which each length scale \n\npossesses a similar pattern of spatial variability and correlation. The corresponding \n\nspatiotemporal response by EM controlled source over a discrete hierarchical or fractal \n\ngeological medium is surely a complicated one, characterized by some broadband, power-\n\nlaw spatial wave number spectrum (Everett and Weiss, 2002).  \n\n \n\nThe behaviour of the different geological scale, affects most of the measured hydrogeologic \n\nproperty\u2019 values, principally the hydraulic conductivity (Neuman, 1994; Winter and \n\nTartakovsky, 2001). This important parameter increase to increasing measurement scale, as \n\nseen in figure 5.1. At Basin-scale, the hydraulic conductivity estimates are often one to two \n\norders of magnitude higher than aquifer pumping test determinations, which by turn are \n\n\n\nELECTRICAL-HYDROGEOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIP \n_____________________________________________ \n\n 88\n\nlarger than laboratory measurements on core samples of the same aquifer material. The \n\nelectric conductivity (EC) like the hydraulic conductivity are both transport properties of the \n\ngeological medium. They depend on geometric parameters at many length scales, such as \n\nthe fracture\u2019s networks connectivity and the tortuous microstructure of the pore space. Thus, \n\nEC should also exhibit similar scale effect. Field-based studies on these subjects are scarce \n\n(Purvance and Andricevic, 2000). \n\nFigure 5.1 - Dependence of hydraulic conductivity with measurement scale, \n\n(modified after Person et al., 1996). \n\n \n\nThe geophysical electromagnetic field data, acquired by different methods, can provide high-\n\nresolution information about underground conditions. Both the structural and the electrical \n\nproperty information, by spatial mapping, can provide important models constraints to \n\nhydrogeology. Structural geometric information can be used to define and delineate \n\nhydrostratigraphic units as well as the locations of fractures and faults. The EC values are \n\nused to qualitatively characterize the rock and soil type as well as the pore fluid properties \n\nestimation. Petrophysical models can often be used to make quantitative predictions about \n\nthe rock and soil properties, such as water content, water conductivity, porosity, clay content \n\nand hydraulic conductivity. \n\n \n\nThese petrophysical models of the EC and hydrogeological properties of rocks and soils are \n\nusually formulated in terms of intrinsic properties of the geological material, like pore and \n\ngrain topology and of the chemical and physical properties of the pore fluids. Relationships \n\nare often non-unique, even with some common controlling factors. The use of multiple \n\nsource data can be used to constrain results, knowing, for instance, the pore fluid \n\nconductivity, porosity, and other relevant geological information. In general several \n\nsimplifications have to be done before empirical relationship\u2019s application between the \n\nhydrogeological and electrical properties. These empirical relations are typically based on \n\ncorrelations made between the electrical and hydrogeological measured data from a specific \n\nsite. The problem with these empirically relations between electrical and hydraulic \n\nparameters, is that they often work reasonably well only to the specific study site or to sites \n\nwith similar characteristics (e.g., Huntley, 1986; Purvance and Andricevic, 2000). \n  \n\n\n\nELECTRICAL-HYDROGEOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIP \n_____________________________________________ \n\n 89\n\n \n\n \n\n5.2 \u2013 Hydrological and electrical properties \n \n\nThe most important and relevant parameters used to characterize the aquifer and fluid \n\nbehaviour, that are usually estimated from or measured in the fields collected data are next \n\ndescribed. \n\n \n\n5.1.1 \u2013 Hydrological properties \n \n\nThe underground soil and the rocks are composed by solid mineral grains and the \n\ncorresponding pore space. The porosity (?) is defined as the ratio of pore volume (or non \n\nsolid space of soil) (Vp) to the total volume of the sample (Vt). A distinction has to be given in \n\nthe materials who contain isolated (not connect) pores. In these cases, the effective (open) \n\nporosity of the connected pore space is less than the total porosity. Fractured systems like \n\nsome basaltic ones can be seen (at-large scale) as a porous medium, although geometry of \n\npore space is rather different from a common sand or sandstone aquifer system. The \n\nporosity associated to this fractured system is considered as a secondary porosity overlaying \n\nthe primary pore space network, and can surpass primary one. Table 5.1 gives measured \n\nrange porosity values for most geologic environments, collected from several literature \n\nsources. \n\n \n\nTable 5.1 \u2013 Representative porosity ranges for soils, materials and rocks. \n\n(after Lesmes and Friedman, 2005) \n\nGeologic medium / material Porosity range \n\nPeat and diatomaceous earth 0.80 - 0.90 \n\nShell fragments 0.62 - 0.72 \n\nSoil 0.50 - 0.60 \n\nClay 0.40 - 0.70 \n\nShaley sand 0.41 - 0.48 \n\nSilt 0.35 - 0.50 \n\nMean to coarse mixed sand 0.35 - 0.40 \n\nUniform sand 0.30 - 0.40 \n\nFine to mean mixed sand 0.30 - 0.35 \n\nGravel 0.25 - 0.40 \n\nGravel and sand 0.20 - 0.35 \n\nSandstone 0.05 - 0.30 \n\nFractured basalt 0.05 - 0.50 \n\nKarst limestone 0.05 - 0.50 \n\nLimestone 0.01 - 0.20 \n\nShale 0.01 - 0.10 \n\nFractured crystalline rock 0.01 - 0.10 \n\nDense crystalline rock 0.01 - 0.05 \n\n \n  \n\n\n\nELECTRICAL-HYDROGEOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIP \n_____________________________________________ \n\n 90\n\nIn saturated media, from where most data concerns, the rate of fluid flow through porous \n\nmaterials is controlled by the saturated hydraulic conductivity (K). For homogeneous and \n\nisotropic materials, K (in m.s\n-1\n) is given by (e.g., Fetter, 2001): \n\n \n\n     ? ? ??\n???\n?

The range of values for the hydraulic conductivity is given below in \n\ntable 5.2. \n\n \n\nTable 5.2 \u2013 Hydraulic conductivity of several formations, \n\n(after H\u00f6lting, 1989). \n\nLithologic formation or rock K  /  m.s\n-1 \n\nGravel, clean 10\n-1\n\n - 10\n-2\n\n \n\nSand, coarse\n \n\n?10\n-3\n\n \n\nFractured basalt 10\n-3\n\n - 10\n-4\n\n \n\nSand, medium\n \n\n10\n-3\n\n - 10\n-4\n\n \n\nSand, fine\n \n\n10\n-4\n\n - 10\n-5\n\n \n\nSand, silty\n \n\n10\n-5\n\n - 10\n-7\n\n \n\nSilt, clayey 10\n-6\n\n - 10\n-9\n\n \n\nClay\n \n\n<10\n-9 \n\n \n\nThe traditional (empirical) expressions to predict hydraulic permeability of saturated sands \n\nfrom just particle grain size was formulated by the end of XIX century, e.g. Seelheim (1880) \n\nand Hazen (1895) (Matthess and Ubell 2003). Both are power law based expressions. The \n\nHazen original formulation (K in cm.s\n-1\n) is given by: \n\n \n\n      ? ? \t\n??\n?     (5.2) \n \n\nwith CH the Hazen empirical coefficient and D10 the particle size for witch 10 % are finer (in \n\ncm). Published value of CH ranges from 1 to 1,000 and Hazen formula\u2019s applicability is \n\ngenerally limited to 0.01 &lt;D10 &lt;0.3 cm (Hazen 1892, 1911; Holtz and Kovacs 1981; Coduto \n\n1999). \n\n \n\nMany variants of this power law had been establish, most of them having exponent values in \n\nthe 1.10 to 2.05 range, with most values significantly less than 2 (e.g. Shepherd, 1989). All \n\nthese empirical formulations are less accurate when compared with latter developed semi-\n\nempirical and semi-theoretical expressions (Carrier, 2003). As the hydraulic permeability, is a \n\nfunction of the existing pore size distribution, they connectivity and tortuosity of pore network. \n\nIn granular materials, the topology of the pore space is given by the grain size distribution, \n\ntheir packing and cementation. \n  \n\n\n\nELECTRICAL-HYDROGEOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIP \n_____________________________________________ \n\n 91\n\nThe formulations of hydraulic permeability models can either be in terms of the pore space \n\ncharacteristics or in terms of the solid mineral grains (e.g., Nelson, 1994). The equivalent \n\nchannel fundamental model developed by Kozeny (1928) and Carman (1937), known as K-C \n\nmodel, assumes that flow through a porous medium can be represented by the flow through \n\na bundle of capillaries (Carman, 1939). Each of this capillary is assumed to represent an \n\nindependent flow path through the medium. The fractured mediums can act and can be \n\nthought accordingly. The effective path length (La) is greater than (or equal) to the \n\nmacroscopic sample length (L). The tortuosity (T) is defined as the square of effective path \n\nlength to sample length ratio. The relation between these parameters is given and follows \n\nexperimental considerations of laminar viscous flow through tubes, (e.g., Scheidegger, \n\n1974); \n\n \n\n     ?? ?\n????\n??      (5.3) \n\n \n\nwith; rh the effective hydraulic radius (in m) and ? the tube shape or form factor (a \ndimensionless number between 1.7 and 3.0). ? is porosity. \n \n\nThe more common indication of the hydraulic radius is given by reciprocal of the specific \n\nsurface area (Sp) (in m\n-1\n), the ratio of pore inner surface area to its volume. Furthermore, the \n\ndefined tortuosity can be related to electrical (resistivity) formation factor (F) through the \n\nfollowing relationship (e.g., Nelson, 1994); \n\n \n\n      ? ? ???? ?\n?\n? ??   (5.4) \n\n \n\nwith formation factor defined as: \n\n \n\n      ? ? ???? ?\n ?\n ?\n\n    (5.5) \n\n \n\nwere ?w and ?b are the fluid and system bulk EC (?w and ?b the corresponding resistivity \n\nvalues), respectively. It is a purely geometric parameter, describing how the porous medium \n\nobstructs transport processes. Thus, it is often assumed to be an indicator of the hydraulic \n\ntortuosity (Archie, 1942). It is detailed further on this chapter. Table 5.3 presents the range \n\nvalue of the formation factor of several media. \n \n\nTable 5.3 \u2013 Formation factor of different lithologic media. \n\n(after Heiland 1968). \n\nLithologic formation or rock Formation factor \n\nPeat and Diatomaceous earth\n \n\n1.0 - 1.5 \n\nMarl, loess, clay and sandy soils\n \n\n1.5 - 4 \n\nPorous clay, sand, sandstone and dolomites\n \n\n3 - 20 \n\nClay and sand in general\n \n\n20 - 40 \n\nDense limestone and sandstone 50 - 100 \n\nIgneous and metamorphic rocks\n \n\n100 \n\n \n  \n\n\n\nELECTRICAL-HYDROGEOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIP \n_____________________________________________ \n\n 92\n\nThe K-C equation (5.3) is more practical when expressed like: \n\n \n\n     ?? ?\n?\n\n?!?\"?\n? ???\n\n?\n\n??      (5.6) \n\n \n\nbecause the F and Sp are well-defined physical parameters that can be measured, whereas \n\nT and rh are theoretical ones that cannot be directly measured. \n\n \n\nMore relationships like those ones expressed by equations (5.1) and (5.6) have been \n\nidentified and also updated by many authors. Relationships between porosity and hydraulic \n\nproperties are usually proposed by semi-log and log-log regression\u2019s analyses with physical \n\nbasis in a set of geometric and hydrodynamic considerations. Those correlations were \n\nobtained empirically, often aided by dimensional analysis and theoretical considerations, and \n\nare known as phenomenological models (Dullien, 1979). Those relationships with hydraulic \n\nproperties include particle\u2019s dependence on pore sizes for both mean values as well as the \n\nentire distribution of values. At grain-scale permeability, models can predict ks to be \n\ndependent and function of the square of an effective grain size and grain sorting, (e.g., \n\nFetter, 2001). Those based on particle size are typically empirical or phenomenological, \n\nwhile the models based on pore sizes more often include assumptions regarding pore \n\nstructure, shape, connectivity (or tortuosity). A rather complete list of these relationships is \n\ngiven by Flint and Selker (2003). A common and generalized applied expression is the one \n\nfrom Georgi and Menger (1994); \n\n \n\n      ?? ?\n???\n???\n\n?#\n$?%?&amp;?    (5.7a) \n\nfrom previous K-C relation, \n \n\n      ?? ?\n'()?\n?*\n\n?#\n$?%?&amp;?    (5.7b) \n\n \n\nD50 is the grain diameter (in cm) of the 50 % grain fraction size distribution (geometric mean). \n\n \n\nAll these K-C models, often called hydraulic radius theory, are closest to a geometric model \n\nbecause assumptions on pore structure are made, whereas a purely phenomenological \n\ntheory based on empirical tests often makes no such assumptions. When particles deviate \n\nstrongly from spherical, broad particle size distribution, the K-C model often gave worse \n\nresults. The disagreement\u2019s reasons between ks predictions and experimental values are \n\nprimarily due to the fact that natural porous mediums are not composed of well-connected, \n\ntubular flow conduits, or constant-diameter pores, which is the basis for many of the theories \n\nand proposed models. The empirical coefficients are introduced to account for the following \n\nsituations. Anomalously high tortuosity (in high porosity media), the assumption of conduit \n\nflow is rather and more appropriately a \u2018\u2018flow around submerged objects\u2019\u2019. The friction drag \n\nmechanisms are dominant over viscous shear mechanisms that determine the friction in \n\nconduit flow. If pores of different sizes are present and operate in parallel, the ks is \n\ndominated by the largest pores rather than if all pores had the same diameter. If pores of \n\ndifferent sizes are operating serially, the sequential variation in the effective cross-section of \n\nflow channels tends to result in a ks linked with the smaller cross section. These two last \n\n\n\nELECTRICAL-HYDROGEOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIP \n_____________________________________________ \n\n 93\n\nassumptions operate oppositely, and there may be some cancellation effects in a porous \n\nmedium (Flint and Selker, 2003). \n\n \n\nBetter results are expected when knowledge of tortuosity is introduced. Pape et al. (1987) \n\nhad shown that tortuosity behaves as a fractal and depends on the effective radius of pore to \n\ngrain radius ratio relation (rh/rgrain) with an exponent involving the fractal dimension (D) of \n\nmedia. Tortuosity increases with increasing fractal dimension in the range of 2.0 &lt;D &lt;2.4. \n\nStrongly fractured and claystones rocks show a fractal dimension in the range of 2.4 &lt;D &lt;\n\n3.0. These later rocks are characterized by a high degree of connectivity of the pore space \n\nsystem, which in turn reduces their tortuosity (Pape and Schopper, 1988). \n\n \n\n \n\n5.1.2 \u2013 Electrical properties \n \n\nThe observed and measured electric conductivity of soils and rocks is essentially a function \n\nof the: water (electrolyte) content, the conductivity of the electrolyte saturated solution and \n\nthe lithology. The electrical conductivity of aqueous solution increases with the concentration, \n\nmobility and electronic charge of the ions in the solution, as well as with the temperature of \n\nthe solution. Considering pure water, it has a relatively very low electrical conductivity of \n\nabout 0.04 \u00b5S.cm\n-1\n (or 250000 ?.m electric resistivity) (Weast, 1983). The conductivity of \n\nnatural groundwater with dissolved salts and other ionic components is much larger. The \n\npore water conductivities range from about 100 \u00b5S.cm\n-1\n (100 ?.m) for freshwater aquifers to \n\n200000 \u00b5S.cm\n-1\n (0.05 ?.m) for oil field brines (e.g., Sch\u00f6n, 1996) being the seawater EC \n\naround 50000 \u00b5S.cm\n-1\n (0.2 ?.m). Thus, groundwater EC value can give us directly the quality \n\ncondition. That is, the salt content amount, as described later on.

Temperature dependence of pure Sodium \n\nChloride (NaCl) solutions has been studied and described by several authors (e.g., Arps, \n\n1953; Worthington et al., 1990). They empirical equations gave a slope temperature \n\ncoefficient variation of 0.022 \u00b0C\n-1\n. This value is also valid for other ions. For natural waters, \n\nthe actual slope value is very similar. That is, around a mean value of 0.019 \u00b0C\n-1\n (Hayashi, \n\nM., 2004). Thus, the electrolyte groundwater conductivity for a temperature other than \n\nstandard can be computed by: \n\n \n\n    +,$?&amp; ? +?561 8 0,020$? &lt;25&amp;>   (5.9) \n \n\nwere +?5 is the water solute EC value at standard 25 \u00b0C. \n \n\n\n\nELECTRICAL-HYDROGEOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIP \n_____________________________________________ \n\n 95\n\nThis means a 2.0% EC change per Celsius degree and a doubling EC value with a 50 \u00b0C \n\ntemperature increase. A groundwater aquifer system with a temperature variation of just a \n\ncouple of degrees throughout the year exhibits only a minor EC temperature induced \n\nvariation. \n \n\nEmpirical relationships also exit relating EC of aqueous solutions to the total dissolved solids \n\n(TDS) content (e.g., Fishman and Friedman, 1989); \n\n \n\n     +, ? @ A TDS     (5.10) \n \n\nwith water EC unit in \u00b5S.cm\n-1\n and TDS in mg.L\n\n-1\n. \n\n \n\nDepending on ionic composition of water solution the constant ? can ranges from 1.2 to 2.0 \n\n(at normal ambient temperatures). The average value for ? is 1.5, usually applied to predict \n\nthe electric conductivity of natural waters at 25 \u00b0C (Fishman and Friedman, 1989). \n\n \n\nThe major salt component of seawater is NaCl with an 85.6% total salt mass content (salinity \n\nof 35). In figure 5.2 the EC (and resistivity) dependence with NaCl mass concentration is \n\nshown. \n\nFigure 5.2 \u2013 Sodium Chloride concentration versus EC, at 20 \u00b0C, (after Worthington et al., 1990). \n\n \n\nThe effective shape of the grains (or pores) and orientation also affects the conductivity \n\nresponse. Solid matrix surface conductivity at the grain interface can have a significant \n\nimportance in fine-grained materials, especially when solution conductivity is low. In this \n\ncase, the surface conductivity models are dependent on the amount of surface area and the \n\nsurface chemical properties of the solid to liquid interface (Lesmes and Friedman, 2005). \n\n \n\nIf the water solution conductivity is known, for instance, from field borehole measures, \n\nelectrical conductivity measurements can be used to estimate the effective porosity of water-\n\nsaturated formations or the water content of partially saturated formations. The most widely \n\nused relationship to predict the effective electrical conductivity response of water-saturated \n\ngeological materials is the famous Archie\u2019s empirical 1\nst\n equation (Archie, 1942), or the \n\nmodified version to under-saturated formations, 2\nnd\n\n equation. Although being an empirically \n\n\n\nELECTRICAL-HYDROGEOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIP \n_____________________________________________ \n\n 96\n\nbased expression, it has been also derived from a fractal model for porous rocks by Pape \n\nand Schopper (1988) and Shashwati and Tarafdar (1997). \n \n\nThe empirical Archie\u2019s law (1\nst\n equation) is expressed by: \n\n \n\n      +, ? E+F?%3    (5.11a) \nor \n\n      ? ? E?%3    (5.11b) \n \n\nlinking the porosity to formation factor. The constant E, named tortuosity factor (or lithology \ncoefficient) it\u2019s applied to correct and account for variation in compaction, pore structure and \n\ngrain size of the sample. Tortuosity factor varies in the range 0.5 to 2.0 (Serra, 1984). Archie \n\nfound that exponent m ranges from 1.3 for unconsolidated sand to 1.8-2.0 for consolidated \n\nsandstones, naming this parameter as the cementation index. \n\n \n\nTable 5.8 resumes some measured cementation index values for several materials and rocks \n\nfound in published literature (e.g., Stefansson et al., 1982; Lesmes and Friedman, 2005). \n\nExperimental measures and theoretically derived petrophysical models, relate this \n\ncementation index to the effective grain shape. The index increases as the grains became \n\nless round (spherical), but keeps almost unchanged to variations in grain size and sorting \n\n(Jackson et al., 1978). \n\n \n\nTable 5.8 \u2013 Archie\u2019s cementation index parameter for several medium. \n\n(after Lesmes and Friedman, 2005) \n\nGeologic medium / material Cementation index m \n\nClean sand 1.3 \n\nConsolidated sandstone 1.6 - 2.0 \n\nShaley sand 1.52 \n\nQuartz sand  1.44 \n\nLimestone 1.9 - 2.3 \n\nFractured basalt 1.0 \n\nGlass beads (spheres) 1.20 - 1.38 \n\nPrisms 1.63 \n\nCylinders, Cubes 1.47 \n\nDisks  1.46 \n\n \n\nThis Archie\u2019s law implicitly assumes that the effective porosity and total porosity are equal, \n\nand that all electrical conduction in a water-saturated rock or soil results from the ion\u2019s \n\nmigration in the bulk pore-solution. If there are non interconnected pores through which ions \n\ncannot migrate, then Archie\u2019s relation will be over predicting electric conductivity. \n\n \n\nAs stated before, in fine-grained materials or at saturated materials with resistive pore \n\nsolutions, surface conduction can be of a significant amount, causing Archie\u2019s law to under \n\npredict the EC. That\u2019s the situation when clay minerals are present due to clay's structure \n\nand cation exchange capacity. This means that the formation factor as defined by expression \n\n(5.5) is strictly valid only to a certain class of petrophysically rocks (Archie rocks). Formation \n\n\n\nELECTRICAL-HYDROGEOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIP \n_____________________________________________ \n\n 97\n\nfactor is known as the apparent formation factor when it varies with solute EC, temperature \n\nand ion type solution. Archie\u2019s 1\nst\n equation has been modified to include this surface \n\nconduction term (+?) in parallel with the bulk conduction term, which results from the \nmigration of ions through the bulk pore solution (e.g., Sch\u00f6n, 1996) and also to be applied \n\nunder unsaturated areas (2\nnd\n\n equation): \n\n \n\n      +F ?\n??\n! G,\n\nH 8 +?   (5.12) \n \n\nwith G, the saturation index of material, n the saturation exponent value, usually close to 2. \nDepartures from this value are variously attributed to the influence of wettability and nature of \n\ndesaturating fluid (Sch\u00f6n, 1996). \n\n \n\nAlthough not being expected that bulk and surface conduction mechanisms act strictly in \n\nparallel (e.g., Friedman, 1998), the simple parallel-conduction model consideration has \n\nseveral practical advantages. One is that differentiation, and estimation can easily be done \n\nbetween F and +? by analysis of the plot +F versus +, (e.g., Waxman and Smits, 1968; \nNadler, 1982). \n\n \n\nThe effects of lithology and solution chemistry on the surface conductivity term in (5.12) were \n\nintroduced and accounted for by Waxman and Smits (1968), (W-S models) like: \n \n\n     +? ?\nIJK\n?      (5.13) \n\n \n\nwhere JL is the cation exchange capacity (CEC) per unit pore volume, a measure of the \neffective clay content, and B the equivalent ionic conductance of the clay exchange cations. \n\n \n\nWaxman and Smits empirically obtained formulas for the dependence of B on the solution \n\nconductivity. Sen et al. (1988) developed one version in which the empirical parameter B is a \n\nfunction of; the solution conductivity (in \u00b5S.cm\n-1\n) and also the cementation index (m). \n\n \n\n     I ? ?,MN3?OP\n\n\n ???      (5.14) \n \n\nThe advantage of this Sen et al. formulation (based upon saline solutions) is that it accounts \n\nfor lithologic effects on the surface conductivity response. However, the empirical parameters \n\nat expression (5.14) are still dependent upon the solution type. The JL value can be \nexpressed by: \n\n     JL ?\n R?S$?%?&amp;\n\n? A CEC    (5.15) \n \n\nwith V3WX the material matrix density. \n \n\nGround and soils CEC range values are naturally linked to the clay mineral composition. The \n\ncritical parameter for conductivity of clayey material is thus not the clay content, but is CEC \n\nvalue (Kirsch, 2006). CEC unit is usually provided as milliequivalent of hydrogen per 100 g \n\n(meq\n+\n/100g), Many such values have been measured and are listed, for example; Kaolinite \n\n(3 to 15 meq\n+\n/100 g), Chlorite (10 to 40 meq\n\n+\n/100 g) or Volclay Bentonite (80 meq\n\n+\n/100 g). \n\n\n\nELECTRICAL-HYDROGEOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIP \n_____________________________________________ \n\n 98\n\n  \n\n\n\n99 \n\n6 \nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n\n \nOn this sixth chapter, the principal settings of Santiago Island (Cape Verde) are given, \nnamely the geology, climatology, hydrogeology and hydrochemistry ones. \n \n \n6.1 \u2013 Santiago island location \n \nSantiago Island belongs to the Cape Verde archipelago. It is the southernmost archipelago of \nthe Macaronesia system, at the North Atlantic Ocean. Santiago is the biggest of the ten \nmajor islands, five smaller desert islands and several islets, composing the Cape Verde \narchipelago. The major town and capital of the country, Praia, is located in the southern side \nof the island. Praia had 100000 inhabitants and total island\u2019s populations were 235000, \naccording to the last population\u2019s CENSOS (INE, 2000). This CENSOS also indicates a total \n432000 inhabitant in the archipelago. \n \nCape Verde is a volcanic archipelago located at the eastern north Atlantic border 450 km \nfrom Africa western coast of Senegal and 1400 km south-south-west from the Spanish \nCanary island\u2019s archipelago, at the Sahel region. It is limited by north parallels 14\u00ba 48\u2019 and \n17\u00b0 13\u2019, and by the west meridians 22\u00b0 42\u2019 and 25\u00b0 22\u2019. The archipelago is divided into three \nsectors; the north one, the western one and the eastern and south one. Santiago belongs to \nthis latter and it\u2019s located between 14\u00ba 54\u2019 and 15\u00ba 20\u2019 north latitudes and between 23\u00ba 48\u2019 e \n23\u00ba 27\u2019 west longitudes. Total Isle surface is 991 km2 with a maximum length of 54.9 km by \n28.8 km maximum wide, north-west to a south-east oriented (figure 6.1). The island summit \nis 1394 meters above mean sea level and is the third highest island of the archipelago. \n\nFigure 6.1 \u2013 Cape Verde archipelago and Santiago island location, with actual counties. \n\n(Modified from MIF (2006)).  \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n___________________________ \n\n 100\n\n \n6.1.1 \u2013 Geologic regional settlement \n \nThe Cape Verde archipelago is an emerged portion of a Mesozoic-Cenozoic volcanic \naccretion in the form of a westward-facing horseshoe along fracture zones converging from \nthe mid-Atlantic ridge toward Africa (figure 6.2). The interior abyssal plain slopes westward, \nincreasing in depth from 2.7 to 4.5 km (Duprat et al., 2007). The archipelago is located on the \nsouthwestern part of the Cape Verde Rise, a swell about 2.2 km high and 1400 to1600 km \nwide that is considered the largest oceanic intra-plate bathymetric anomaly (Lodge and \nHelffrich, 2006). Islands stand on 120 to 140 Million years (Ma) old (Williams et al., 1990, \nM\u00fcller et al., 2008) and about 85 km thick (Cazenave et al., 1988) oceanic lithosphere. The \ncrustal thickness is anomalously high beneath the islands (reaching 22 km), but have a \nnormal 7 km between them (Lancelot, Y. and Seibold, E., 1977, Ali M. Y. et al., 2003; Lodge \nand Helffrich, 2006; Pim J. et al., 2008). \n \nAn important residual geoid gravimetric and heat flow anomaly is present (Dash et al., 1976; \nCourtney and White, 1986). These features are believed to result from mantle plumes \n(Sleep, 1990). The Cape Verde genesis from a deeply anchored mantle plume seems to be \nsupported by seismic tomography studies (Montelli et al., 2006; Zhao, 2007) and by He \nisotope signatures obtained both from silicate and carbonatitic rocks (Christensen et al., \n2001, Doucelance et al., 2003, Mour\u00e3o et al., 2007, Mata et al., 2010). This underneath \nplume explains the observed volcanic activity and the associated geothermal anomalies. Off-\nshore seismic refraction line\u2019s results indicate a 2 to 3 km of semi consolidated sediments \nunderlining a 3 to 6 km of basalt and 6 to 8 km of plutonic rocks (Duprat et al., 2007). \n\nFigure 6.2 \u2013 Cape Verde archipelago horseshoe structure with bathymetry values. \n(Modified from Madeira et al. (2010)).  \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n__________________________ \n\n 101\n\nThe archipelago island\u2019s formation as been linked to a hotspot mechanism (Holm et al., \n2008) and the oldest published date for the Cape Verde hotspot (about 26 Ma) was obtained \nfor a submarine basalt from the basal complex of the Sal Island (Torres el al., 2002). \n \nThe island\u2019s formation had begun with an initial underwater volcanic core, lately completed \nby a network of small-scale faults, seen at the outcrops (Serralheiro, 1976a, Alves et al., \n1979). All the region have been subjected to important vertical movements (De Paepe et al., \n1974; Gerlach et al., 1988; Millet et al., 2008) with measured values in the 0.2 to 0.4 mm per \nyear range (Madeira et al., 2010, Ramalho et al., 2010a and b). \n \nThough Cape Verde's islands are all volcanic in origin, they show a widely variety of terrain \nand geomorphology aspect. The first geological report and account study was from Charles \nDarwin\u2019s epic voyage at the \"Beagle\u201d (Darwin, 1844). The following geology report of these \nislands (except Fogo one) comes with Bebiano (1932) monograph. A comprehensive and \ndetailed description of these early works can be found from Mitchell-Thom\u00e9 (1972 and 1976) \nrespective article and book and references therein. \n \nThe archipelago islands are principally composed of igneous rocks, with basic volcanic and \npyroclastics comprising the majority of the total volume (Bebiano, 1932). The archipelago is \nan example of a soda-alkaline petrographic province, with a petrologic succession which is \nsimilar to that found in other mid Atlantic islands of the Macaronesia system. The archipelago \ncurrently exposed volcanic sequences ranging from the Miocene to the present (Madeira et \nal., 2010). Some islands are flat with just small elevations, like Sal (406 m high) and Maio \n(436 m). Others have relatively high central mountains, like Fogo (2829 m), Santo Ant\u00e3o \n(1978 m), Santiago (1394 m) and S\u00e3o Nicolau (1304 m). \n \n \n6.2 \u2013 Santiago geology \n \nThe most ancient Cape Verde archipelago formations are from Mesozoic era (late Jurassic \nand early Cretaceous periods), found at island of Maio (Rigassi, 1975, Serralheiro, 1976a, \nAlves et al., 1979). Santiago\u2019s formation is slightly posterior and like all other islands, has \nborne from a central volcanic system. The principal island and the main structure were \ncreated by several times stages episodes, with a changing volcanic activity rate. At low \nvolcanic activity periods, erosion took place. Lately, the eroded valleys have been again \nrefilled with new basaltic flows. The oriented axe of Santiago seems to be related to an \novertime volcanic activity migration. \n \n \n6.2.1 \u2013 Volcanostatigraphic: a brief description \n \nEruptive rocks are the dominant in Santiago, responsible for the building of is morphology. \nSedimentary formations do exist at several small portion areas. Metamorphic rocks are \nalmost inexistent (Serralheiro, 1976a). Santiago\u2019s geologic map was done by Serralheiro \n(1976b), at a 1:25000 scale. The 1:100000 scale map was published one year later \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n___________________________ \n\n 102\n\nSerralheiro (1977). After this, Matos Alves team did the petrologic and volcanologic study, in \nconnection and linked to the other islands (Alves et al., 1979). \n \nSerralheiro assigned several important historical evolution stages at Santiago Island: \n \nFirst Stage \u2013 Palaeogene (65 to 23 Ma) \nThe initial undersea water eruptions take place followed by the aerial emersion of the \nvolcanism. This stage created the ancient internal eruptive complex. \n \nSecond Stage \u2013 Palaeogene to Neogene (Oligocene to lower Miocene epochs, 36 to 20 Ma) \nLower volcanic activity with hard erosive action takes place, with destruction of previous \nsuperficial volcanic systems. Large underwater deposits have been originated with those \neroded materials. \n \nThird Stage \u2013 Neogene (Lower Miocene epoch, 20 to 16 Ma) \nSeamount stage takes place. Rise of the sea level above the 450 m actual mark. \n \nFourth Stage \u2013 Neogene (Middle Miocene epoch, 16 to 12 Ma) \nVery intense extrusive activity along with great extends of land covert areas. This \ncorresponds to \u201cFlamengos Formation\u201d. At present days only the submarine facies is known. \n \nFifth Stage \u2013 Neogene (Middle to upper Miocene epochs, 12 to 5 Ma) \nRegression period to a level not smaller than 250 m high takes place. Break off volcanic \nactivity and thick sedimentary deposits formation with marine and terrestrial facies. This \ncorresponds to \u201c\u00d3rg\u00e3os Formation\u201d. \n \nSixth Stage \u2013 Neogene to Quaternary (5 Ma to present) \nBefore the last extrusive period, the generalized erosion and sedimentation process give \nraises to dune and beach deposits some tens of meters above the sea level (Plistocene \nepoch). Last volcanic activity creates many scoria and pyroclastic cones. At the Halocene \nepoch, the terrestrial deposits are generalized, as like the sand beach one. \n \nThe volcano-statigraphic description is summarized at table 5.1, with principal mineralogical \nspecimens included (Martins, 2003), following the Serralheiro (1976a) and Matos Alves et al. \n(1979) proposed sequence characterization. Detailed description can be found at those \nauthors\u2019 works and also at the recent thesis about the hydrochemistry of the island, by Mota \nGomes (Gomes, 2007) and Ant\u00f3nio Pina (Pina, 2009). \n \nThe X-ray diffraction mineralogical analyses from former authors (Serralheiro, 1976a, Matos \nAlves et al., 1979 and Martins, 2003), revealed similar compositions between the principal \nmineralogical associations, from the different formations on the island. The mineralogy of \nbasanits essentially formation is olivine, pyroxene and plagioclase, with small quantities of \niron and titan oxides. The mineralogy of melanefelinits formations is feldspatoids (nefeline), \ntogether with olivine, pyroxene and iron and titan oxides. \n  \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n__________________________ \n\n 103\n\n \nTable 6.1 \u2013 Main geologic formations and associated mineralogical specimens, \n\nat Santiago Island.

The corresponding geologic map is plotted at figure 6.3. \n \nI \u2013 Internal ancient eruptive complex (CA) \nThis is the most ancient rock formation of the island. They are essentially basic dikes and \nfono-traquits, with some silicate granular rock intrusions. It corresponds to the evolutionary \nfirst stage. They are mostly visible to west-central part of the island, with vertical and near \nvertical dikes, corroborating the central genesis of Santiago. The low permeability and \nproductivity of this formation give it a reduced hydrogeologic importance. \n \nII \u2013 Pre-\u201cFlamengos\u201d formation conglomerates \nThese are conglomeratic formations covering the CA formation (and very alike the \n\u201cFlamengos\u201d formation). They are visible to south, with a small extent. Lower deposits start \nby thin layers and evolve to broad sediments. No assigned hydrogeologic activity exists to \nthis formation.  \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n___________________________ \n\n 104\n\nIII \u2013 \u201cFlamengos\u201d formation (FL) \nThis formation covers discordantly the CA formation, and corresponds to basic breeches and \npyroclastics, with great extent and uniformity, with submarine genesis. It is found all over the \nisland except to the north. Formation occurrence is over the 250 m altitude mark. The \nhydrogeologic productivity of this formation is relatively low, except at the areas where pillow \nlavas do exist, giving then pumping rates over the 20 m3.h-1. This formation corresponds to \nevolutionary fourth stage. \n \nIV \u2013 \u201c\u00d3rg\u00e3os\u201d formation (CB) \nThis formation essentially shows thick basaltic blocks (sharp to round ones) from secondary \nvolcanic phenomena. CB formation corresponds to fifth stage of the historical evolution, with \ngreat extent erosion. It is highly heterogeneous with sand intercalations and purely \nconglomeratic. Deposits can be thick by more than 100 m. Most of this formation outcrop at \nSantiago central region (S. Jorge dos \u00d3rg\u00e3os) and north and west, to a small extent. This \nformation is packed to a high degree and as no hydrogeologic importance, except at areas \ncontaining pyroclastics cones and high number veins. \n \nV \u2013 Post-\u201c\u00d3rg\u00e3os\u201d formation \nThis formation belongs to post CB traquitic phase, with a limit extent. Its major expression is \nseen at Monte Branco, located at the centre of the island. There are endogenous domes \ngreatly disassembled but cutting and metamorphing the old submarine lavas, FL sedimentary \nand CA formation. There is no important assigned hydrogeologic specification to this \nformation. \n \nVI \u2013 Pre-\u201cPico da Ant\u00f3nia\u201d sediments \nThis formation shows small sedimentary outcrops, with fossil sandstone-limestone and \nconglomerates. This formation is found at island south locations. With a limited extent, this \nformation has also no hydrogeologic importance. \n \nVII \u2013 \u201cPico da Ant\u00f3nia\u201d complex (PA) \nThis is one of the most important geologic formations, filling more than half of the island area, \nspanning over a long time period with a great volumetric content. It is responsible by high-\naltitude relief as also the main structural platforms of Santiago. Formation spans\u2019 materials \nfrom effusive and explosive activities, submarine and terrestrial. Older PA formation does \nexist at the south and southeast (Vailleux et al., 1974) and at the east side (Serralheiro, \n1976a) with a predominant terrestrial facies. Sedimentary layers do exist among magmatic \nevents, but it is sometimes difficult to clearly differentiate and identify these episodes \nbetween locations. This sedimentary stage is more expressive at the north side of Santiago. \nAfter this initial period, an important erosion process took over followed by a partial \nimmersion with substantial submarine emissions. All this process is repeated once more and \nends with an important explosive phase. Resulting materials have high relative porosity, \nwhich gives them a good hydrologic productivity \u2013 becoming the island most important \naquifer system. \n \n  \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n__________________________ \n\n 105\n\nVIII \u2013 \u201cAssomada\u201d formation (A) \nThis formation corresponds to a new eruptive period, exclusively terrestrial with basaltic \nfacies lava flows and a few pyroclastics, after an important erosive time. Formation is located \nat Santiago\u2019s central west side with large horizontal layers, and has good hydrological \ncharacteristics. \n \nIX \u2013 \u201cMonte das Vacas\u201d formation (MV) \nThese formations correspond to island\u2019s last volcanic episodes. The produced pyroclastics \nbasaltic cones (tufts and scoria) and small flows through the island, have high porosity ones. \nAlthough direct MV groundwater exploration is not feasible (formation is very shallow), it has \nan important hydrological roll by leaking to the underling PA formation. \n\nFigure 6.3 \u2013 Santiago geologic map after Serralheiro (1976b, 1977). (Modified from Pina (2009)). \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n___________________________ \n\n 106\n\nX \u2013 Quaternary sedimentary formations \nThese recent formations cover 8.5% of the island land total surface, and are mainly formed \nby alluvium, slop or runoff flow deposits, dune sands and maritime beaches at several levels \nto the 100 m elevation mark (Serralheiro, 1976a). They are very important units, especially at \nthe major valleys of the east coast island side, with some 40 m thick layers (Vailleux et al., \n1974). Local boreholes and wells provide most of the groundwater to inhabitants and \nespecially to land irrigation, as these formation\u2019s soils are the islands suited ones for \nagriculture. These Quaternary formations are plotted at figure 6.4, and match the main and \nprincipal transient creeks of the island, as they fill most of the eroded valleys. \n\nFigure 6.4 \u2013 a) Santiago Quaternary sedimentary formations, b) major transient creeks location, \n\n(modified from Pina (2009)). \n \n6.2.2 \u2013 Geomorphology \n \nThe morphology of Santiago Island is linked to geology and is the outcome of the \nevolutionary process. It is dominated by steep topographic gradients and eroded valleys. \nThere has been assigned seven geomorphologic units, although at some areas, the limit \nbetween them could be difficult to define. Sub classification as been also assigned to some \nof these units. Detailed geomorphology account can be found at Marques (1987, 1990). \nLocation and limits of those units are shown at figure 5.5. The next brief description is based \non Marques (1990). \n \nI \u2013 South volcanic plateau (Achadas Meridionais) \nUnit extension is from Pico da Ant\u00f3nio south side mountain to the coast. It covers roughly \none-third of the island. It is a PA basaltic flow with tuffs intrusions and having slope\u2019s ranges \nfrom 2 to 12%.  \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n__________________________ \n\n 107\n\nFigure 6.5 \u2013 Geomorphology map of Santiago (modified from Marques (1990)). \n\nUnits: I - South volcanic plateau, II \u2013 Pico da Ant\u00f3nia mountain massif, \n\nIII \u2013 Santa Catarina plateau, IV \u2013 East side border, V \u2013 Malagueta mountain massif, \n\nVI \u2013 Tarrafal plateau, VII \u2013 West side border \n \nII \u2013 Pico da Ant\u00f3nia mountain massif \nThis unit is located at the southwest central part. The highest point is the Pico da Ant\u00f3nia, at \n1392 m. The system is highly eroded with sharp summits. It is almost formed by PA eruptive \ncomplex and represents the south rim of the last big volcanic crater. Observed slopes have \nmore than 25%. It is a natural water recharge system to the island. \n \nIII \u2013 Santa Catarina plateau \nThis plateau is located in the middle of the island, surrounded at south by Pico da Ant\u00f3nia \nmountain, at north by the Serra Malagueta mountain. It is an almost flat area with a mean \nelevation of 500 m. This unit seems to represent the eroded bottom of the volcanic crater that \nas created the PA eruptive complex (Serralheiro, 1976a). \n \nIV \u2013 East side border \nThis unit extends from S\u00e3o Domingos creek valley, at south, to the S\u00e3o Miguel creek valley, \nat north. All sporadic streams born at Santa Catarina plateau, Pico da Ant\u00f3nia or Malagueta \nmountains, have at the start, high slopes, that decrease to a 7% mean value at halfway \ndistance to the coastline. Observed lithologies are tuffs and breccias with lava flows. At \neroded areas, the succession from the CA, Flamengos, Org\u00e3os and PA formations are seen. \nThis unit is completely exposed to predominant northeast trade winds that blow throughout \nthe year.  \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n___________________________ \n\n 108\n\nV \u2013 Malagueta mountain massif \nThis unit is the north rim of the ancient big volcanic crater. The summit is at Serra da \nMalagueta with 1064 m, and is entirely a PA formation. It is between the Tarrafal plateau unit \n(at north) and Santa Catarina plateau (to the south). The mountain exhibits mean slopes of \n25%. It\u2019s north flank is exposed to the predominant northeast trade winds. \n \nVI \u2013 Tarrafal plateaux \nIt\u2019s the north side unit, with several plateaux between 20 and 300 m high, with gentle mean \nslopes of 4%. This unit is formed by PA formation. The Monte Graciosa is the local higher \nmountain (605 m) formed by fonolits and traquits. At this unit, the areas of Tarrafal and Ch\u00e3o \nBom are covered by recent flood flow deposits, coming from debris of lava flow erosion. The \npredominant northeast trade winds affect only the northeast side of the unit. \n \nVII \u2013 West side border \nThis unit is located between the Santa Catarina plateau and the sea, at the west coast. \nSome CA outcrops exist, but PA lava flows and tuffs dominate the landscape as basaltic \nlayers of Assomada formation. It is a very arid region with high slopes between 12 and 25%. \nThe shoreline is high over the ocean. This region is one of the most naturally eroded of the \nisland (and archipelago) with the lowest inhabitant\u2019s density, in contrast to the island east \nside. \n \n6.3 \u2013 Santiago climatic settings \n \nThe superficial and groundwater dynamics are greatly, if not entirely, connected to the \ngeomorphology of the island (Custodio, 1975). Superficial water path is driven by \ntopography, as the establishment of water circulation lines and the observed flow regime is \nfully a function of local slopes (Meneses, 1977; Rodrigues F., 1993; Rodrigues C., 1995; \nAzevedo, 1998; Fontes, 1999). But to have water running we need to collect water from the \natmosphere. Again, the island\u2019s morphology and topography play a key role (figure 6.6). The \nmaritime moisture air masses, mostly from the east, interacted with island landscape \ndifferently. Air masses flowing over the low altitude gentle slopes have a different action than \nupper air masses at the higher mountains and valleys, as rainfall is convective in origin \n(Correia, 1998). Precipitation and evapotranspiration (ET) have a strong gradient between \ninland and coastal areas. A major difference exists also between the east and west sides of \nthe island (Rodrigues C., 1995; Azevedo, 1998). Landscape flora is also of great importance; \nto the water infiltration process and soil protection, to evapotranspiration and to runoff. \n(Falkland and Custodio, 1991, Rodrigues F., 1993, Meneses, 1993). \n \nCape Verde is located between the subtropical Atlantic north high pressure (Azores \nanticyclone) and West Africa inter tropical convergence zone (ITCZ). The orientation and \nposition of those systems have a great impact over the archipelago (Amaral, 1964). When \nthis later atmospheric system is shifted to the south, precipitation drops dramatically when \nthe archipelago stays exposed to the northeast dry winds from Sahara desert. The variability \nof the West Africa inter tropical convergence position drives the observed variability of the \nCape Verde rain amount. Some years the rain amounts can be 2 to 3 plus the mean value. \nOthers can be waterless. \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n__________________________ \n\n 109\n\nFigure 6.6 \u2013 Santiago five layers topographic map. \n\n \n \n6.3.1 \u2013 Precipitation \n \nCape Verde is characterized by two annual main weather conditions; the \u201cwind season\u201d from \nNovember-December to June-July and the \u201crain season\u201d from July-August to October-\nNovember, each year \u2013 the equatorial monsoon, with July and November the transition \nmonths between those epochs. Although annual and monthly rainfall amounts in Cape Verde \nare invariably low, daily or storm precipitation values can be very high (Rocha Faria, 1971). \nTo quantify the rain amount, there are on the island several measure points (figure 6.7). The \ntotal amount of meteorological and hydrological stations is nowadays of 17. They had started \ncollecting data from 1940 onward, but only less than half have complete time series. They \nbelong to Cape Verde\u2019s National Meteorological Intitute (Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia e \nGeof\u00edsica - INMG). Station\u2019s spatial distribution is not uniform and is smaller than the \nrequired minimal, necessary in this kind of mountain island (Linacre, 1992), which is one \nstation per 25 km2. Island\u2019s west side is badly sampled. \n \nPrecipitation time series from 1961 to 2009 yields a 363 mm annual mean value. This \namount changes greatly from year to year, but especially with altitude and distance to the \nsea. Inland and higher locations are the rainy ones. For instances, the Ch\u00e3o Bom (16 m \namsl) at extreme north, and Praia Airport (64 m) at extreme south, have annual mean \nprecipitation of 197 and 164 mm respectively. At Assomada (462 m) this value is 466 mm \nand at S. Jorge dos Org\u00e3os (310 m) is 430 mm. Higher locations like Serra da Malagueta \n(765 m) has 670 mm. Rainfall intensity is another important factor. Precipitation is not \nuniform all over the \u201crain season\u201d, with August and September being the rainiest months \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n___________________________ \n\n 110\n\n(figure 6.8). Traditionally, there are episodes of high-intensity precipitation with heavy storms. \nRainfall days range from 3 to 20. For most of the years, 45% of mean annual rain falls on \nvery short time periods. It is normal to have at the higher areas 200-300 mm per day after \nthese storm events (Mannaerts and Gabriels, 2000), which leads to intense superficial runoff \nwater and floods in the creek valleys. Surface water resources exist only on those days. The \nstorm episodes have little effect to aquifer\u2019s recharge, but a dramatic impact to the soil, \nproducing heavy erosion and destruction at the farmed valleys\u2019 areas. \n\nFigure 6.7 \u2013 Santiago rain gauge, meteorological and hydrological stations location (INMG). \n \n\nFigure 6.8 \u2013 Mean monthly rainfall for some Santiago\u2019s locations (1961-2009), (INMG). \n \nTime rainfall variability can be seen at figure 6.9. Data from five stations is plotted from north \nto south, top to bottom, down the island axis. It\u2019s evident a strong annual variability and that \nlower altitude locations have much less rainfall than higher ones. Mean rainfall spatial \ndistribution is given at figure 6.10. Accuracy is limited by stations spatial locations. \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n__________________________ \n\n 111\n\nFigure 6.9 \u2013 Santiago\u2019s monthly rainfall for some locations, from 1961 to 2009, (INMG). \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n___________________________ \n\n 112\n\nFigure 6.10 \u2013 Santiago\u2019s mean annual precipitation (1961-2000), (INMG). \n \n \n6.3.2 \u2013 Temperature \n \nAir temperature at Santiago is conditioned by relief exposition and orientation, elevation and \ndistance from the sea. From the few available temperature time series, it\u2019s possible to assign \na annual mean value of 24.2 \u00baC to the island, with a small amplitude range from 21.0 \u00baC to \n25.1 \u00baC. The higher mean temperatures are at stations near the sea at low altitude, Praia \nairport (at south) and Tarrafal (at north) with respectively, 25.2 \u00baC and 24.7 \u00baC. At a high \nplace such as Assomada, the mean annual value is 21.1 \u00baC with an amplitude of just 4.6 \u00baC. \nThis last value is roughly the main island amplitude. \n\nFigure 6.11 \u2013 Monthly temperature mean values (1973-2005), (INMG). \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n__________________________ \n\n 113\n\nAll island\u2019s locations have minimum annual temperatures in January-February and maximum \nones in September. That can be seen from the monthly temperature values, figure 6.11. The \nannual temperature starts rising slowly and steadily from January onward until September\u2019s \nmaximum and followed by a fast decline to the minimum. The daily temperature variations \ndon\u2019t show large amplitudes, too. The daily minimum is reached at dawn (5 - 6 hour local \ntime) and maximum at afternoon (13 - 14 hour local time), as expected. \n \n \n6.3.3 \u2013 Relative Humidity \n \nSantiago relative humidity (RH) mean values are always above the 60% mark. That\u2019s \nbecause for the most part of the time, the island is under a cloudy sky condition. RH time \nseries only exist for five meteorological stations. Overlapping data spans only two decades \n(1981 to 2001). The island mean RH value is 74%. Mean minimum value is 68% and \nmaximum 79%. The mean value increases and temperature decrease as we go inland to \nhigh locations. Annual variations are plotted at figure 6.12, for the five meteorological \nstations. \n \n\nFigure 6.12 \u2013 Relative humidity mean annual values (1981-2005), (INMG). \n \nTrough the year, the mean monthly value of RH increases steadily from the minimum in \nMarch to its maximum value in September and then decreases again, closing the annual \ncycle, in good correlation with the temperature patterns. Monthly values are plotted at figure \n6.13. \n \nThe importance of these almost constant RH values on the island, trough the year, is \nconsiderable. Not only, it reduces the ET amount but also adds water, by \u201chorizontal \nprecipitation\u201d, to the high regions of the island. Several studies and experiments have \nmeasured the total amount of this recharge for the usual 3 km2 foggy area of Santiago, at \n1000 m high. The obtained values range over from 1500 to 3500 m3 per day (Cunha, 1964; \nJuvik, 1988, Sabino, 2004). \n  \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n___________________________ \n\n 114\n\nFigure 6.13 \u2013 Monthly relative humidity mean values (1981-2005), (INMG). \n \n \n6.3.4 \u2013 Wind \n \nThe wind is one of the most important factors to the island rain amount. The three prevailing \nwinds at Santiago are (table 6.2); \n- the northeast trade that blows for most of the year, but brings almost no rainfall yet being \nvery wet. They normally produce foggy conditions at high northeast side regions. \n- the dry and hot east that blows from continental Africa at winter months, usually with \nimmense dust content. \n- the south and southwest monsoon that blow between July and September, responsible for \nthe \u201crain season\u201d. \n\nFigure 6.14 \u2013 Monthly wind speed mean values (1981-2004), (INMG). \n  \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n__________________________ \n\n 115\n\nThe average measured wind speed is higher at the lower and southern regions, enhancing \nET effect at southern regions. The mean annual value at Praia Airport is 5.8 m.s-1 (at 2 m \nhigh) and 1.2 m.s-1 at S. Jorge dos Org\u00e3os. The wind speed is almost constant trough the \nyear, decreasing from June-July to September-October, at the \u201crain season\u201d. The monthly \nwind speed values are plotted at figure 6.14, for the five meteorological stations. \n \n\nTable 6.2 \u2013 Percentage measured wind direction \n\nat Praia Airport meteorological station (INMG). \n\nWind direction Number of measures (%) \n\nN 42.7 \n\nNE 35.0 \n\nE 6.1 \n\nSE 2.2 \n\nS 3.5 \n\nSW 1.5 \n\nW 0.5 \n\nNW 1.6 \n\nno wind condition 6.9 \n\n \n \n6.3.5 \u2013 Sunshine \n \nSunshine at Santiago Island has a mean annual amount of about 7 h per day. Lower regions \nhave a higher sun exposition. That is, have more daily hours of clear sky than highlands of \nthe island (figure 6.15). Throughout the year, the brightness months are at the springtime \nbeginning, with a minimum at the August-September \u201crain season\u201d (figure 6.16). As happen \nto the temperature, RH and wind speed parameter, the insulation values at Ch\u00e3o Bom (at \nTarrafal, extreme north) exhibits local topographic effects, probably influenced by the nearby \nSerra da Malagueta. \n \n\nFigure 6.15 \u2013 Sunshine mean annual values (1973-2001) (INMG). \n  \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n___________________________ \n\n 116\n\nFigure 6.16 \u2013 Monthly sunshine mean values (1973-2001), (INMG). \n \n \n6.3.6 \u2013 Soil and vegetation \n \nMost part of Santiago\u2019s soil is volcanic by nature, rocky and thin, with little evolution. They \nare slightly alkaline with low organic matter content, but have altered minerals (Costa, 1995). \nSoil\u2019s field capacity values vary in the range 50 to 200 mm per year (Fernandopull\u00e9, 1977) \nand mean infiltration\u2019s rates values vary between the 40 mm per hour at alluvium and 40 to \n80 mm per hour at basalts (BURGEAP, 1974). The wild vegetation is adapted to these \nclimatic conditions, and is mainly composed by gramineae, bushes and woody specimens \nlike Acacia nilotica. \n \n \n6.3.7 \u2013 Evapotranspiration \n \nThe potential evapotranspiration (PET) can be measured or estimated using several \nmethods. Data have been collected by evaporimetric and Piche\u2019s tank. With this available \ndata, Pina (2009) reached the following annual PET values, at three different stations, with \nthree different methods (table 6.3) \n \n\nTable 6.3 \u2013 Annual PET values (units are in mm), (adapted from Pina (2009)). \nMethod Praia Airport S. Jorge Org\u00e3os Serra Malagueta \n\nPiche tank 1034 939 705 \n\nPenman 1298 714 811 \n\nThornthwaite 1687 1204 1203 \n\n \nThese monthly values are plotted at figure 6.17 (for a mean hydrological year) and show \nincreased PET variations at low altitude. At Summer time, the PET values are higher. The \nminimum values occur at winter beginning. Of these three methods, the Penman seems to \nbe the closest to reality, and Thornthwaite the less adequate to this climatic characterization. \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n__________________________ \n\n 117\n\nFigure 6.17 \u2013 Monthly rainfall, potential evapotranspiration and real evapotranspiration values \n\nat three meteorological stations (modified from Pina (2009)). \n \nData analysis shows a different scenario at all these three stations. In Praia, a low altitude \nand shoreline location, there is no water surplus at any time of the year. The real \nevapotranspiration (RET) is always equal to the precipitation (R). At S. Jorge dos Org\u00e3os, an \nintermediate altitude place, precipitation exceeds the RET only in August and September \n\u201crain season\u201d months. At Serra da Malagueta, a high-altitude location, precipitation exceeds \nRET trough all \u201crain season\u201d. These two last locations attain the necessary direct conditions \nto runoff and soil infiltration waters. \n  \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n___________________________ \n\n 118\n\n \n6.4 \u2013 Santiago recharge \n \nWith these climatologically settings, a bioclimatic classification can be assigned to the \nseveral regions of Santiago, according to their altitude. The corresponding K\u00f6ppen\u2013Geiger \n(KG) climate classification system is shown in figure 6.18 for Santiago. \n \nI - Arid zone: from shoreline to 200 m altitude. Rainfall is less than 300 mm per year. \nLandscape is covered by herbaceous. KG: BWh \n \nII - Semi-Arid zone: between the 200 m and 400 m high. Rainfall is between the 300 mm to \n400 mm per year. Landscape is covered by herbaceous, like arid zone, but with more \nspecies. KG: BSh \n \nIII - Sub-Humid zone: between the 400 m and 600 m high. Rainfall is between the 400 mm to \n600 mm per year. Landscape is covered by bushes and woody trees. Extreme dry conditions \nare very rare. KG: CWa \n \nIV \u2013 Humid zone: above the 600-700 m high. Rainfall is more than 600 mm per year. It never \nreaches a dry condition. KG: CWa \n\nFigure 6.18 \u2013 Bioclimatic zones at Santiago (modified from INGRH).  \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n__________________________ \n\n 119\n\n \n6.4.1 \u2013 Recharge value estimation \n \nStudies have been carried on to quantify Santiago\u2019s ground water recharge. Empirical \nmethods have been applied (BURGEAP, 1974, Fernandopull\u00e9, 1979, Bossher, 1981, \nDittrich, 1982, BURGEAP, 1983, PNUD, 1992), and also water balance calculations \n(Fernandopull\u00e9, 1979, BURGEAP, 1983, PNUD, 1992). The results are not in accordance, \nand express the difficulty to achieve a good estimation with the available data, (table 6.4). \n \n\nTable 6.4 \u2013 Studies recharge values with actual \n\nmean rainfall value (R = 363 mm per year). \nStudy \n\nAuthor \n\nRecharge\n \n\nmm per year hm\n3 \n\nBURGEAP (1974) \n16 16 \n\n54 to 182 54 to 180 \n\nFernandopull\u00e9 (1979) 36 to 62 36 to 61 \n\nPNUD (1992) 11 to 65 11 to 64 \n\n \nAnt\u00f3nio Pina (2009) has done recent recharge estimation by two different methods; a \nphysical - the classical Penman-Grindley soil water balance equation (Penman, 1950, \nGrindley, 1967) and a chemical - the water-saturated zone Chloride budget. \n \nTo do that, Pina had measured the total area of bioclimatic zones with recharge abilities, and \nassigned a rainfall value from the most representative weather station at zone. Arid and \nSemi-Arid zone area amounts to 573 km2. Sub-Humid zone area amounts to 152 km2 and \nHumid zone area amounts to 77 km2. The three main hydrogeological units in Santiago have \nbeen defined from the geological formations, BURGEAP (1974). They are; the Recent Unit - \nQuaternary sedimentary and \u201cMonte das Vacas\u201d formations, the Middle Unit - \u201cAssomada\u201d \nand \u201cPico da Ant\u00f3nia\u201d eruptive complex formations and the Bottom Unit - \u00d3rg\u00e3os\u201d, \n\u201cFlamengos\u201d and Internal ancient eruptive complex formations. This last hydrogeology unit \narea wasn\u2019t accounted for, as it has a very low permeability. These units will be detail latter \non the chapter. \n \nOn the first method using the classical balance equation (6.1), the climatologic input \nparameters come from the meteorological station\u2019s data; \n \n     ??? ? ?? ? ????????? ? \t\n?    (6.1) \n \nwhere ??? is the mean recharge value, ?? the mean precipitation, ????????? the mean real \nevapotranspiration and \t\n? the mean superficial runoff water. \n \nPenman-Grindley method works better at humid regions where soil never gets dry. At arid \nand semi-arid zones, RET is less then PET and equal to precipitation, which leads to no \nrecharge condition. Nevertheless, occasional water recharge can happen with storms and by \nthe indirect leaks from high central island areas. Mean superficial runoff water assigned \nvalues are 50 and 150 mm to III and IV zones, respectively. These values agree with \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n___________________________ \n\n 120\n\nobservations and local inhabitant descriptions about the maximum flood high in-stream \nvalleys and time durations after traditional big storm events. \n \nRecharge values are given at table 6.5. Total annual recharge amount with Penman PET \nmethod is 19 hm3 (9.0% of estimated rainfall) and with Piche\u2019s tank PET method is 27 hm3 \n(12.8% of rainfall). These are mean values corresponding to climatological time series \n(average values). Year to year there is recharge variability, mostly driven by rainfall quantity \nand less by temperature, sunshine, humidity and wind speed, more constants over time. \n \n\nTable 6.5 \u2013 Bioclimatic zones annual Penman-Grindley method recharge values, \n\n(modified from Pina (2009)). \n\nBioclimatic Zone \nArea \n\nkm\n2\n \n\nPrecipitation \n\nmm per year \n\nPET \n\nmethod \n\nRecharge \n\nper year \n\nRecharge/ \n\nPrecipitation \n\nmm hm\n3\n % \n\nI - Arid zone and \nII - Semi_Arid \n\n573 164 \nPenman 0 0 0 \n\nPiche tank 0 0 0 \n\nIII - Sub-Humid 152 430 \nPenman 55 9 12.8 \n\nPiche tank 74 11 17.2 \n\nIV - Humid 77 670 \nPenman 143 10 21.3 \n\nPiche tank 204 16 30.4 \n \nThe second method - the water-saturated zone Chloride budget - applies to Chloride \nmeasures at incoming rain and at groundwater. It was implemented originally at Israel\u2019s \ncoastal plains in the 60\u2019 of last century (Eriksson and Khunakasem, 1969). It recently was \nsuccessfully applied at some volcanic islands (Custodio, 1997; Lameli, 2001; Custodio, \n2004). This method assumes that the Chlorine ion is conservative in the system, which has \nvertical flux at recharge area and horizontal flux within aquifer, and that groundwater Chloride \ncomes only from rainwater. It is assumed that the Chloride input is constant over the time \ncovered by the analyses, and that the groundwater is taken sufficiently deep to prevent \nevaporation. The mean recharge value is given by (e.g. Allison and Hughes, 1978): \n \n\n     ??? ? ?? ?\n??????\n???????\n?????     (6.2) \n \nwhere ??? ? is the mean Chloride rainwater concentration, ??? ?? is the mean Chloride dry \ndeposition and ??? ? is the groundwater mean Chloride concentration. \n \nRecharge values obtained with this method are given at table 6.6. Total annual recharge \namount estimated with this chemical method is 40 hm3 (19.0% of rainfall). The volume is \ngreater than the one given by the previous method. That\u2019s because the method cannot give \ngood recharge estimation at the arid and semi-arid zones. The two method\u2019s results are in \nvery good agreement at Sub-Humid and Humid zones. \n \nFrom these two methods, the estimated average recharge value can be given as 30 \u00b1 10 \nhm3 per year. Recharge is necessarily smaller at dry years. But at unusual rainy years, with \nmore storm events, superficial runoff increases accordingly preventing high recharge values. \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n__________________________ \n\n 121\n\nTable 6.6 \u2013 Bioclimatic zones annual Chloride budget method recharge values, \n(modofied from Pina (2009)). \n\nBioclimatic Zone \nPrecipitation \n\nmm per year \n\n??? ? ? ??? ?? ??? ?

Nevertheless, the \nprincipal features of the system settings are the volcanism type, size and distance to main \nemission source, tectonic activity, age and non volcanic intruded materials (Custodio, 1986). \nVolcanic Groundwater path in Volcanic Islands is mostly linked to lithology formations. Empty \nspaces within rocks (porosity), vary in volume and shape, frequency and connectivity, being \nresponsible by hydraulic properties, especially at most-recent formations (Rodrigues, 2002). \nThe basaltic rocks typically have higher permeability (mainly those of acid type), and more \nrecent lava flows are also more permeable then ancient flows (Custodio and Llamas, 2001). \nPorosity can range between 10 and 50% in pyroclastics rock type, to less than 5% at heavy \nlavas (Custodio, 1978). Hydrological units at Santiago have been grouped by their common \nformation\u2019s behavior. Data comes from geologic, borehole logging and pumping test\u2019s data \nstudies (BURGEAP, 1974). Figure 6.19 shows the spatial distribution of the three main units; \nBottom, Middle and Recent. \n \n6.5.1 \u2013 Bottom Unit \n \nThe bottom unit is composed by the internal ancient eruptive complex (CA), the \u201cFlamengos\u201d \n(FL) and \u201c\u00d3rg\u00e3os\u201d (CB) formations. It is a compact unit, with strong altered outcrops and \nconsequently, has a relatively low permeability against more recent units. The top 20 to 30 m \nCA formation are in general fractured and altered, with roughly 5 to 10 % porosity. The \nformation is compact below this layer without any groundwater on it. At this shallow layer, \nboreholes and wells have 5 to 15 m3h-1 productions (8 to 10 hours per day extraction). Mean \nvalue of transmissivity (T) of this formation range from 0.2 to 5\u00d710-5 m2s-1. The FL formation \nhas hydraulic properties similar to those of CA. The exceptions are the pillow lavas\u2019 areas \nwhere mean production can reach the 20 m3h-1 (10 to 12 hours per day), with small water \nlevel withdraw. The behaviour of the CB formation is like the others two, with general mean \nproduction of 5 m3h-1. The Value can be higher than that in CB formation (up to 10 m3h-1) with \npyroclastics content, dikes and fractures\u2019 presence. This hydrological unit shows high a \ndegree of mineralization waters.  \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n___________________________ \n\n 122\n\nFigure 6.19 \u2013 Hydrogeologic Units at Santiago. (Modified from Serralheiro, 1976a). \n \n6.5.2 \u2013 Middle Unit \n \nThis unit is composed by \u201cPico da Ant\u00f3nia\u201d eruptive complex (PA) and Assomada formation \n(A). The PA formation is mainly a structure of basalt (submarine and aerial) with some \npyroclasts showing some tens of meter\u2019s thickness. This is the main aquifer system, although \nshows a broad permeability, decreasing with depth. With the presence of pillow lavas, the PA \nformation has transmissivity values from 10-1 to 2\u00d710-2 m2s-1. Pumping at these areas can be \nhigh as 40 m3h-1 (12 or more hours per day). Mean extraction, is, however, of about 3 to 5 \nm3h-1 with transmissivity values from 10-4 to 5\u00d710-4 m2s-1. The Assomada formation has also \nsome tens of meters, and is located at Assomada plateau. Mean extraction at this formation \narea is 20 to 25 m3h-1 (10 to 12 hours per day), with transmissivity values ranging from 10-4 to \n5\u00d710-4 m2s-1. \n \n6.5.3 \u2013 Recent Unit \n \nThis unit is composed by the \u201cMonte das Vacas\u201d (MV) formation and by Quaternary alluvium \ndeposits. The former is essentially composed by basaltic pyroclastic cones and is extremely \npermeable. They are very important recharge areas liking groundwater to the system \nunderneath. At the alluvium formation, hydraulic parameters are a function of grain size, \nthickness and clay content. When these Quaternary formations are thick, coarse and clay \nfree, they can present high porosity and permeability values, with transmissivity ranging from \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n__________________________ \n\n 123\n\n10-1 to 2\u00d710-2 m2s-1. The productive boreholes at the several eastern downstream valleys \n(like Flamengos, Picos, Seca and S\u00e3o Domingos creeks) can reach 40 m3h-1 (12 hours per \nday). Upstream the same valleys, where formation\u2019s thickness is smaller and materials are \nthinner, transmissivities range from 10-4 to 10-5 m2s-1 and the mean extraction rate drops to 8 \nm3h-1 (12 hours per day). \n \n\nTable 6.7 \u2013 Main hydrologic units hydraulic parameters, (adapted from BURGEAP (1974)). \n\nHydrologic \n\nUnit \n\nGeologic \n\nformation \n\nExtraction  /  (m\n3\nh\n\n-1\n) T \n\nm\n2\ns\n\n-1\n limits useful \n\nBottom \n\nCA 0 to 10 3 0.2 to 5\u00d710-5 \n\nFL 0 to 25 5 0.2 to 5\u00d710-5 \n\nCB 0 to 10 3 0.2 to 5\u00d710-5 \n\nMiddle \n\nPA \n\n0 to 10  (basalt with pyroclasts) 5 10-4 to 5\u00d710-4 \n\n0 to 5  (tufts and breeches) 3 0.2 to 3\u00d710-4 \n\n20 to 100  (pillaw lavas) 40 10-1 to 2\u00d710-2 \n\n10 to 60  (breeches) 30 10-1 to 2\u00d710-2 \n\nA \n0 to 10  (basalt with pyroclasts) 5 10-4 to 5\u00d710-4 \n\n5 to 40 (thick areas) 25 10-4 to 5\u00d710-4 \n\nRecent \n\nMV - - - \n\nAlluvium \n2 to 15  (upstream valley) 8 10-4 to 10-5 \n\n20 to 100  (downstream valley) 40 10-1 to 2\u00d710-2 \n\n \n6.6 \u2013 Santiago watershed points \n \nThe number of registered watershed points at Santiago is nowadays more than 3000 \n(INGRH). This number comprises natural springs (1199), manmade wells (1074) and \nboreholes (880). First census was done in the 70s of the last century and by end of 1979; the \nwatershed points were already 2287. The initial knowledge of the hydrologic parameters \ncame from the analyses of those data. With the growing and demanding of population, the \nwater resources increasing is almost entirely due to new borehole facilities, at a present-day \nmean rate of ten boreholes by year. Not all this watersheds is still active. Many wells had \nbecome dry and only seven hundred are useful. The number of working borehole is around \nthree hundred. The valuable springs are about to 264, but only 41 have a really important \nwater flow rate. To overcome water needs, the Poil\u00e3o water dam at Seca stream was \nfinished by 2008 (Gomes, 2007). It is a medium rainfall catchment structure with an 1.2 hm3 \nvolume capacity. A few desalinization power plants exist also. Nowadays, 70% of Praia\u2019s \nwaters consumption comes from desalinization. \n \n6.6.1 \u2013 Springs \n \nSprings are related to geology, especially to fractures and dike\u2019s location. Most of them are \nfound at island central plateau, between Pico da Ant\u00f3nia and Serra da Malegueta mountains. \nSprings are found from 3 m to 804 m high, and they have a seasonal variability trough the \nhydrologic year. The most productive springs have a 300 m3 per day mean flow that can be \nhigher as 1000 m3 per day after \u201crain season\u201d. Springs total water flow estimation exceeds \ncertainly 5 hm3 reaching perhaps 10 hm3 a year.  \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n___________________________ \n\n 124\n\n6.6.2 \u2013 Wells \n \nWells are the manmade oldest way to extract water, existing since archipelago occupation. \nTypically, they have 2 to 4 m diameter with 3 to a maximum of 15 m depth. They are settled \nat alluvium formation, and made with stone walls. Most of them are located at the eastern \nside of the island, figure 6.20a), but can also be found at central and higher locations, at \nBottom Unit basalt fractured layer or receiving water from some perched water body. They \nusually provide small water quantities, between 10 to 15 m3 per day, at Bottom Unit \nformations. At the alluvium that quantity can easily grow to 100 m3 per day. Wells represent a \nwater-quality problem as they are extremely vulnerable to contaminations by standing on \nhigh permeable formations near the shoreline. The over-exploitation and diffuse \ncontaminations by human activities are a constant at many locations. \n \n6.6.3 \u2013 Boreholes \n \nBoreholes have a more uniform distribution over the island, and have been made from the \nsea level to 700 m high, figure 6.20b). Their location is related to local hydrogeological \nsettings and also to sea distance, to prevent seawater intrusion. Boreholes depth varies from \n30 to 270 m, with deeper ones at higher locations. INGRH controls annually 150 boreholes \nthat make a groundwater extraction of 4.5 hm3. It is reasonable to consider a maximum total \namount of 9.0 hm3 by all the 300 operational boreholes on the inland. \n\na)                                                                     b) \n\nFigure 6.20 \u2013 Location of active and controlled wells a) and boreholes b), (INGRH). \n \n6.6.4 \u2013 Piezometric head \n \nFrom INGRH water level regular measure\u2019s data set (not covering all databases points, but \njust a couple hundred) it\u2019s possible to map the groundwater piezometric head surface of the \nisland.  \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n__________________________ \n\n 125\n\nThe analysis of the time evolution of springs discharges, plus the groundwater level at wells \nand boreholes have shown that piezometric level seems to be reasonable continuous all over \nthe island. There is a direct, as also an indirect observed seepage (a few months after \u201crain \nseason\u201d). Springs discharge amount can vary a lot after precipitation. Piezometric level \nvariations aren\u2019t significant over the last decade, at island scale dimension, (Pina, 2009). The \npiezometric map is presented at figure 6.21, with plotted flow direction, driven by the \nhydraulic gradient, (care must be taken especially at areas where no data exist to support \nkrigging interpolation or same outlier data point). From level lines, clearly that the piezometric \nsurface follows the topographic one (see figure 6.6) and have the same island axis \nsymmetry. Groundwater flows naturally outwards, and drains to gully valleys and sea. \nHydraulic gradient is higher (around 0.05 m.m-1) at high-altitude locations, and much smaller \nat lower ones (around 0.008 m.m-1). \n\nFigure 6.21 \u2013 Santiago piezometric map, 2004 (INGRH data). \n \n6.6.5 \u2013 Conceptual hydrogeologic island model \n \nAs described, Santiago (like all Cape Verde islands) has predominantly made by basaltic \nlava flows, interspersed with pyroclastics and breccias and intruded by near-vertical mafic \ndikes. The current conceptual understanding of recent volcanic oceanic island hydrogeology \nis based primarily on Hawaiian studies (Peterson 1972, Macdonald et al., 1983, Oki et al., \n1999, Hildenbrand et al., 2005). On this high topographic relief, shallow soils, and rapid \nrunoff or infiltration islands, the conceptual hydrogeologic model consists of a regional low-\ngradient water table aquifer with overlying perched and dike-confined groundwater bodies. \nThe vertical and steeply dipping intrusive feeder dikes form as magma moves upward \nthrough both the central caldera and along fissures at volcano\u2019s flank (through pre-existing \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n___________________________ \n\n 126\n\nlava flows). These denser and low-permeability intrusive feeder dikes often act as barriers to \nhorizontal flow, creating large groundwater reservoirs (Mink, 1963; Peterson, 1972; Jackson \nand Lenat, 1989). At the same time, low-permeability clay layers intercalated with and \nformed by the weathering of the upper surfaces lava flows may also act as hydraulic barriers \n(Barmen et al., 1990). Such horizontal and vertical flow barriers produces perched \ngroundwater bodies, the highland springs, and by compartment of groundwater, can create a \nstepped and discontinuous water table (figure 6.22). \n\nFigure 6.22 \u2013 Generalized conceptual model of volcanic islands hydrogeology, \n\n(modified from Macdonald et al., 1983). \n \nThe admitted model for Santiago is that the majority of infiltration and groundwater recharge \noccurs at the highest areas, as they have many times more precipitation than coastal areas, \nhigh-permeability basalts, and closed-basin calderas (Barmen et al., 1984, 1990; Kallr\u00e9n and \nSchreiber, 1988). Application of this conceptual model to Santiago Island is compatible with \nthe existence of a major groundwater central reservoir at Middle Unit, the PA and Assomada \nformations being the catch area the closed-basin of Santa Catarina plateau (Pina, 2009). The \nreservoir could have a lens shape being thicker in the middle, resting over the much more \nimpermeable Bottom Unit, figure 6.23. At this central region, the many intrusive near-vertical \ndikes can create independent groundwater bodies. Groundwater movement at the central \nregion is essentially vertical downward, but the many fractures, faults and dikes play a key \nrole to the local groundwater path. At lower regions, near the surface the water movement is \nroughly sub-horizontal to the sea, but an upward flow can be present from deeper \ngroundwater. \n\nFigure 6.23 \u2013 Santiago conceptual model (modified from Pina (2009)). \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n__________________________ \n\n 127\n\nThe low-density lens shape freshwater reservoir stands over the higher-density brackish and \nsaltwater. Under steady-state conditions, the freshwater hydraulic head above sea level \nshould be balanced by an approximately 40-fold thickness of fresh water beneath sea level, \nas given by the Ghyben-Herzberg principle. Boundary between fresh and brackish waters \nisn\u2019t even sharp or fixed. It is controlled by pressure and density and is balanced by \ngroundwater recharge and groundwater discharge (Peterson 1972). Aquifer drawdown due \nto excessive extraction will lower water levels and move the fresh/brackish water interface \nupward and inland, producing a salt-water intrusion (Gingerich and Oki, 2000). Springs are \nthe manifestation of groundwater natural discharge at Santiago. The others are wells and \nboreholes withdrawals, occasional seepage to streams, and shallow water table \nevapotranspiration. Groundwater discharges most probably also includes a sub-surface \noutflow to the ocean. Such submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) has been documented \nin other volcanic island sites (Izuka and Gingerich 2003; Hildenbrand et al. 2005; Prada et al. \n2005) and could represent a substantial fraction of total groundwater discharge from the \nisland aquifer. \n \n \n6.7 \u2013 Santiago hydrochemistry \n \nThe properties of groundwater are very limited and piecewise if we just stay at the knowledge \nof water table depth (or the hydraulic head), flow amount, temperature or electric conductivity \n(EC), for instance. With chemical and isotope hydrology, many more parameters data are \navailable, allowing the access to the concealed nature of groundwater. \n \nStarting with pure water, it is composed by the most common Hydrogen and Oxygen atoms, \nbut also with more rare isotopes, like Deuterium (2H or D) and heavy Oxygen 17O (very rare) \nand 18O. A sample of pure water will be mostly H2O with some heavier rare molecules HDO \nand H2\n\n18O. \n \nNatural water has also dissolved salts, dissociated into cations and anions. The most \ncommon cations are Sodium (Na+), Calcium (Ca2+), Magnesium (Mg2+) and Potassium (K+). \nThe most common anions are Chloride (Cl-), Bicarbonate (HCO3\n\n-), and Sulphate (SO4\n2-). \n\nWater contains also dissolved gases. The major source is the atmosphere with molecular \nNitrogen (N2), Oxygen (O2), and noble gases; Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton \n(Kr), and Xenon (Xe). Many more can be of biogenic origin, added to the water in the ground, \nlike Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), and Hydrogen Sulphide (H2S). \n \nCosmic rays interact with our upper atmosphere and produce a variety of radioactive \nisotopes. Three of them have a special interest to hydrology; Tritium (3H or T) the heaviest \nhydrogen isotope, Carbon-14 (14C), the heaviest isotope of carbon, and Chlorine-36 (36Cl), a \nrare Chlorine isotope. The half-life rate of radioactive decay gives us the time of permanence \nat saturated zone since incorporated into groundwater, and they are 12.32 \u00b1 0.022, 5730 \u00b1 \n40 and 301000 \u00b1 4000 years, respectively to Tritium, Carbon and Chlorine radioactive \nisotopes. Those rates allow investigation period values from a few decades, to 25000 years, \nand 100000 to one million years, respectively. All these isotopes have also been produced \nby nuclear bomb tests, providing additional inputs to natural systems (Mazor, 2004). \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n___________________________ \n\n 128\n\nWater with all these (and more) components will infiltrate into the ground, and react \nchemically with underground rocks that have minerals and biologic materials. Physical \nfactors are also important, for instance, to rock rupture and hence more area available to \nreactions. At Santiago Island, most rocks are basaltic by nature, mostly with siliceous \nminerals. This rock type is extremely favourable to chemical alteration process, like \ndissolution, hydrolyse and oxidation. Not only, rock type, but also the climatic condition, \nwater constituents, rock-water interaction time and soil existence are factors that control \nchemical rock changing degree. At scarce rain regions, like the arid and semi-arid areas of \nSantiago, the chemical alteration processes are naturally slower. Rock\u2019s influence depends \non its texture, structure and mineral composition. The structure and texture are decisive to \nwater path and solely by the surface rock area \u2013 water interaction. Cationic groundwater \ncontent is then changed, as some of these rock elements, like Na, Ca, Mg and K dissolves \neasily, function of pH and temperature (Custodio and Llamas, 2001). \n \nSeveral hydrochemistry investigations have been done at Santiago Island. Barmen et al. \n(1984) made principal groundwater elements studies and Tritium determinations at north, \ncentral and eastern locations. Akiti (1985), has done stable isotope\u2019s determinations (2H, 18O, \n13C), Tritium and 14C at Tarrafal and Achada Baleia locations. The INGRH (1994) has done a \nsimilar study, including the first rain water chemical and isotopic analyses at Santiago Island. \nRecent studies have been from Hydroarid project. Under the scope of this project, a new \nchemical campaign has been done, sampling uniformly the island at 133 points. (Gomes, \n2007; Pina, 2009), and 2H, 18O, and 3H isotopic analyse to 60 points (a subset of the 133) \nhave been also accomplished (Carreira et al., 2007a). Last hydrochemical and stable \nisotopic study was about potential recharge areas and salinization groundwater mechanism \nat eastern seashore, Condesso de Melo et al. (2008). \n \nThe following descriptions are mostly based on the Hydroarid project data. Chemical \nanalyses are from samples taken in June-July 2003 (before the \u201crain\u201d season), in November-\nJanuary, 2003-2004 (after the \u201crain\u201d season) and throughout the year 2004. Isotopic \nanalyses are from December 2005, February 2006 and November 2006, altogether with \nchemical samples analyses. The number of samples by watershed and hydrogeologic unit \nare given at the table 6.8, and plotted at figure 6.24. \n \n\nTable 6.8 \u2013 Chemical and isotopic analyses by hydrologic unit and watershed type. \n\nHydrogeologic \n\nUnit \n\nSpring Well Borehole \n\nChemical Isotopes Chemical Isotopes Chemical Isotopes \n\nBottom 10 1 - - 18 3 \nMiddle 30 15 - - 49 32 \nRecent - - 25 - 1 9 \nTotal 40 16 25 - 68 44 \n\n \nAll these water sampling and analysis\u2019s procedures are described at the Gomes (2007) and \nPina (2009) thesis. The analysis\u2019s electroneutrality (EN) value is under 4% for 33% of total \nsamples and between 4 to 10% for the remaining 77%. The acceptable error should be less \nthan 5% (Appelo and Postma, 2005) or 4% to \u201chigh\u201d electric conductivity waters (Custodio \nand Llamas, 2001). Groundwater samples total mean EN value is 6.45%.  \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n__________________________ \n\n 129\n\nFigure 6.24 \u2013 Chemical and isotopic sampled watersheds. \n \n \n6.7.1 \u2013 Groundwater temperature \n \nWater and rock temperature is important because it enhances significantly the mineral and \ngases\u2019 solubility. However, temperature data analyses have shown that no significant \ndifference exists between shallow and depth groundwater, and between the different \nhydrogeological units. Temperature remains almost the same throughout the year, with small \namplitude, less than 1 to 2 \u00baC. Several boreholes follow the seasonal atmospheric \ntemperature variation being always warmer than air. Figure 6.25a) plots the mean measured \ntemperatures. Mean temperature is around 26 \u00baC, with some spurious watershed points. \nMinimum and maximum temperatures (20.3 and 34.9 \u00baC) were measured at Middle Unit \nformation. The Recent Unit as the smallest amplitude between extreme temperatures. \n \n\nTable 6.9 \u2013 Temperature mean values at hydrogeologic units. \nTemperature \n\n\u00baC \n\nHydrogeologic Unit \nBottom Middle Recent \n\nMean 26.2 26.1 26.0 \n\nStandard deviation 1.8 1.9 1.4 \n  \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n___________________________ \n\n 130\n\n \n6.7.2 \u2013 Groundwater pH values \n \nThe pH parameter is very important because it controls chemical reactions, like acid-base \nequilibrium, hydrolyze, adsorption, redox (Langmuir, 1997). At Santiago, a clear difference \ncan be seen; the eastern region groundwater are slightly acid to neutral (6.75 to 7.25) and \nwestern regions more alkaline (> 7.25). A possible explanation can be related to the \npredominant winds at this island side, with bigger moisture content and also were most \ngroundwater extraction happens, water time residence and rock-water interaction being \nsmaller. Figure 6.25b) shows the mean measured pH values. Minimum and maximum pH \n(5.7 and 8.2) were measured at Middle Unit formations. Like temperature values, the Recent \nUnit has the smallest amplitude between extreme pH values (6.5 to 7.5). Lowest and highest \npH areas in figure 6.25b) are due to some pH \u201coutlier\u201d measured single points. The problem \nalways happens when the spatial distribution is non-uniform and extreme data points are \npresent, creating an \u201ceye pattern\u201d (closed lines around a single point). \n \n \n\nTable 6.10 \u2013 pH mean values at hydrogeologic units. \n\npH \nHydrogeologic Unit \n\nBottom Middle Recent \n\nMean 7.1 7.1 7.0 \n\nStandard deviation 0.3 0.4 0.2 \n \n \n\na)                                                                       b) \n\nFigure 6.25 \u2013 Temperature a) and pH b) Santiago\u2019s maps, \n\n(temperature map modified from Pina (2009)).  \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n__________________________ \n\n 131\n\n6.7.3 \u2013 Groundwater electric conductivity \n \nGroundwater electric conductivity (EC) it\u2019s a function of ionic content and also temperature. It \nis a measure of mineralization degree, e.g. by rock dissolution, or can result from industrial, \nagriculture, domestic and salt intrusion contaminations. At Santiago, high EC values are \nfound near the sea, decreasing inland and in altitude. Eastern island side shows grater EC \nvalues than the western side. This later coastline is higher above the sea with fewer \ninhabitants and consequently, smaller water extraction needs. Areas with smaller EC at north \nand south correspond to springs and boreholes at Middle Unit. Although some variability in \nEC values has been observed, the majority of sampled points haven\u2019t changed significantly \nover the time of this study, especially between dry and rain epochs. Exceptions have been \ndetected at some points in Recent Unit formations, near the sea, with smaller EC values after \n\u201crain season\u201d, certainly due to the increase in the inland freshwater content. The EC \ndistribution is shown at figure 6.26. \n \n\nTable 6.11 \u2013 EC mean values at hydrogeologic units (20 \u00baC). \nElectric conductivity \n\n\u00b5S.cm\n-1 \n\nHydrogeologic Unit \nBottom Middle Recent \n\nMean 1353 1226 2895 \n\nMedian 1261 741 2215 \n \n\nFigure 6.26 \u2013 Electric conductivity distribution map (20 \u00baC), (modified from Pina (2009)). \n \nFor the Bottom Unit, the minimum and maximum values were 440 and 2750 \u00b5S.cm-1. Middle \nUnit shows much greater amplitude, from 362 to 53500 \u00b5S.cm-1 (seawater) and Recent Unit \nfrom 503 to 8550 \u00b5S.cm-1. These very high EC were observed in wells close to the sea. If we \nexclude these outlier points (with explained cause), the mean EC values (table 6.11) \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n___________________________ \n\n 132\n\nbetween the Bottom and Middle Units are similar but smaller than those in Recent Unit \nmeasured values. The sampled watersheds at this last Unit are mostly wells in alluvium \nformations. At the Bottom Unit the EC mean value stays constant over the distance to \nshoreline. For the Middle and Recent Units, that not holds. EC values grow significantly \nstarting from 1.5 km to shoreline. \n \n6.7.4 \u2013 Groundwater cations \n \nIn Santiago Island, the relation between major cation\u2019s abundances has as follows; \n[Na] > [Mg] ? [Ca] > [K]. Cations are the groundwater constituents who have major affinity \nand interaction with environment rocks and came from this rock-water interaction process \nand also from human activities and seawater intrusion. Mean observed values are given in \ntable 6.12. \n \n\nSodium (Na\n+\n) \n\n \nThis is by far the predominant cation in the island groundwater, with 55% of the total cation\u2019s \namount. Sodium can have different sources; Halite (sodium chlorine) maritime aerosol \ndeposition at dry season (incorporated to soil in \u201crain season\u201d), alkaline type rock with plenty \nof Sodium, Calcium and Magnesium, and ultimately from seawater intrusion. Groundwater \nSodium distribution seems almost constant throughout the island, with a 100 to 150 mg per \nliter mean content. It is the natural background concentration, presumable from rain and rock \nminerals dissolution origin. Exceptions to these are the north and eastern regions. At those \nlocations, the values are much higher, presumable from seawater intrusion origin. At the \nBottom Unit hydrogeological unit the Sodium mean value stays constant with distance to \nshoreline. For the Middle and Recent Units, the Sodium concentration grows significantly, \nstarting 1.5 km to shoreline, figure 6.27a). That mimics the EC behavior because this \nparameter is a function of water salt concentration. Range values are from 19.7 to 438 mg.L-1 \nat Bottom Unit, 22.6 to 652 mg.L-1 at Middle Unit and 67.6 to 1349 mg.L-1 at the Recent Unit. \n \nMagnesium (Mg\n\n2+\n) \n\n \nFor most of Santiago areas, Magnesium content surpasses the 25 mg per liter. At the \neastern coastal region, that value is much higher. Magnesium origin must come from \ndolomite and magnesite dissolution (Martins, 2003) or olivine hydrolyzes (Matos Alves et al., \n1979). Range values are from 4.1 to 51.7 mg.L-1 at Bottom Unit, 1.8 to 64.6 mg.L-1 at Middle \nUnit and 6.0 to 347.9 mg.L-1 at Recent Unit. Magnesium distribution is plotted at figure \n6.27b). \n \nCalcium (Ca\n\n2+\n) \n\n \nThe highest values of Calcium concentration do exist at the east and north island side. Origin \ncan be from Calcite dissolution (Calcite exists at the major volcanic formations), carbonate \nrock dissolution at Tarrafal region (at north), by plagioclase hydrolyze and pyroxene\u2019s mineral \nalterations or by seawater intrusion with Sodium cationic exchange. Range values are from \n8.0 to 126.4 mg.L-1 at Bottom Unit, 6.4 to 1280 mg.L-1 at Middle Unit and 32.0 to an extreme \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n__________________________ \n\n 133\n\nvalue of 3496 mg.L-1 at Recent Unit (last value comes from one seawater intruded well). \nMolar ratio between Ca/Mg is less than one at most samples. That means that there is a \nmajor dissolution of magnesium minerals over calcium ones. Calcium distribution is given in \nfigure 6.28a). \n\na)                                                                       b) \n\nFigure 6.27 \u2013 Sodium a) and Magnesium b) distribution maps. \n\na)                                                                       b) \n\nFigure 6.28 \u2013 Calcium a) and Potassium b) distribution maps.  \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n___________________________ \n\n 134\n\nPotassium (K\n+\n) \n\n \nGroundwater Potassium distribution is enhanced in the northwest, west and east regions of \nthe island. The Potassium origin must be related to potassium feldspats interactions. They \nhave been identified in fractures at CA formations, with frequent well developed crystals \n(Matos Alves et al., 1979). Another Potassium origin is surely the fertilizer application at \nfarmed valley\u2019s soils, although the limited Potassium mobility caused by soil retention at clay \nlayers.

These anions came from natural \nrock-water interaction process and also from human contamination, like agriculture activities. \nMean values are given at table 6.13. \n \nChloride (Cl\n\n-\n) \n\n \nThis groundwater anion specimen comes directly or indirectly from seawater, as rock source \nchloride has a small expression. It reaches the groundwater by sodium chlorine maritime \naerosol deposition (like sodium) and by seawater intrusion at the seashore. Inland, the \ngroundwater mean chloride concentrations is less than 150 mg.L-1. The major groundwater \nChloride distribution happens at eastern and northwest shoreline, figure 6.29a). The Bottom \nUnit has the smaller concentration and Recent Unit the highest. Range values are from 49.6 \nto 535 mg.L-1 at Bottom Unit, 26.2 to 5,708 mg.L-1 at Middle Unit and 42.5 to a extreme value \nof 14003 mg.L-1 at Recent Unit (last value is from a seawater intruded well). \n \nBicarbonate (HCO3\n\n-\n) \n\n \nThe highest concentrations of Bicarbonate are located inland at central island major recharge \nareas, figure 6.29b). For most samples, it is the major anion. In addition to rainwater origin, it \ncomes also from carbonate dissolution or minor silicate weathering. The Bottom Unit has the \nhighest concentration and the Recent Unit has the smallest. Range values are from 146 to \n708 mg.L-1 at Bottom Unit, 78 to 566 mg.L-1 at Middle Unit and 78 to 372 mg.L-1 at Recent \nUnit. \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n__________________________ \n\n 135\n\n \nSulphate (SO4\n\n2-\n) \n\n \nThe anion Sulphate is one of the less abundant in Santiago\u2019s water samples. Distribution is \nrather uniform except near the east coast and at \u201c\u00d3rg\u00e3os\u201d formation (Bottom Unit), figure \n6.30a). These inland higher concentrations are related to marine facies carbonate rocks. It\u2019s \nroughly the same region were high bicarbonate values also take place. At shoreline, it may \nbe related to seawater intrusion, as Sulphate is one of the major seawater anions. This \nexplains the small concentration values observed at the Middle Unit. Range values are from \n4.6 to 296 mg.L-1 at Bottom Unit, residual to 364 mg.L-1 at Middle Unit and 18.2 to 546 mg.L-1 \nin Recent Unit. \n \nNitrate (NO3\n\n-\n) \n\n \nAt Santiago, Nitrates doesn\u2019t exist naturally. They leach into groundwater by overfertilization \nat farmed soils, especially in the stream valleys\u2019 closest to the ocean. The other contaminant \nsources are manure, at some punctually intensive goat\u2019s areas and nonagricultural sources \nsuch as septic systems and cesspools (Santiago Island hasn\u2019t yet a developed residual \ndrainage network). The majority of groundwater samples (98%) show Nitrates contends. 15% \nof all samples surpass the human consumption legal admitted maximum.

Oceans have a constant molar Br/Cl \nratio of 0.00154 (e.g., Drever, 1997; Davis et al., 1998, 2001). Small islands and coastal \nrainfall commonly have similar Br/Cl ratios. However, inland rainfall at arid or semi-arid \nclimates may have lower ratios due to the tendency for Chloride to be removed by deposition \nof marine aerosols in coastal areas (Edmunds, 2001). \n \nAt Santiago, the major part of the groundwater samples (for the three hydrogeologic units), \nhave a Br/Cl ratio that fits to the ocean molar ratio (figure 6.31a), confirming groundwater \norigin. A few groundwater samples have a reduced ratio that could be due to interaction with \nChloride bearing contaminants such as some fertilizers (Cartwright et al., 2006). However, \nthe plot of molar Na/Cl ratio, figure 6.31b) (seawater as a constant ratio of 0.85) shows for \nhigher concentration samples, that Sodium seems to be arrested by clay minerals.

SI is defined as the logarithm of the ratio of the ion \nactivity product to the solubility product. \n \nAt northwest area (Tarrafal region), the springs show an undersaturation condition of calcite \nand dolomite, meaning that water hasn\u2019t been enough time to get into equilibrium with those \nminerals. That could represent a mixture of different origin waters. Concerning borehole \nwaters, some are supersaturated with respect to dolomite and some are undersaturated with \nrespect to calcite. This saturation index variation can be due to different waters contributions. \n \nAt Eastern side (Achada Baleia region) most of the wells are undersaturated with respect to \ncalcite, and a few are supersaturated with respect to dolomite. Calcite minerals appear to \ndominate as the majority of wells have Ca/Mg molal ratio greater than unity. In boreholes, \nmost of the waters are supersaturated with respect to dolomite and only half of them are \nsupersaturated with respect to calcite. The Ca/Mg molal ratio is generally lower than unity, \nshowing a greater presence of magnesium over calcite minerals. The basic rocks of Middle \nformation are responsible for the dissolution of magnesium (Akiti, 1985). Deeper waters are \nolder than superficial waters, because they had sufficient time to become in equilibrium with \ndolomite and calcite. These are the ones which SI values cannot be attributed to different \nwaters mixing. Both borehole and well waters are silica saturated (typical at this crystalline \nrock environmental). \n \nAs a rule, boreholes waters have a saturated and supersaturated condition related to \ndolomite and magnesite. This is also verified for calcite, but to a lesser extent. The majority \nof the water from springs and wells are undersaturated to those minerals (Pina, 2009). This \nmeans that superficial groundwater is younger than the deeper groundwater. \n \n \n6.7.7 \u2013 Chemical groundwater facies \n \nGroundwater chemical is usually described by plotting data in special diagrams, for instance, \nthe Stiff and Piper patterns. The observed groundwater facies type it\u2019s a consequence of \nwater origin - rainfall, followed by its land deposition and variable interaction with \nunderground rock minerals, and lately by human activity\u2019s impact and / or seawater \ninterconnection. All this factors, trough time, had influence over the observed water \ncomposition and quality, at the natural and manmade seepages. \n \nIsland Stiff patterns (figure 6.33) show a distinct behaviour by hydrogeological unit and \nconsequently, by watershed location. The central, south and southwest regions with Bottom \nand Middle units have an ionic amount (salts) much smaller than seashore ones at Recent \nUnit formations (eastern and north sides). \n  \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n__________________________ \n\n 139\n\nFigure 6.33 \u2013 Santiago\u2019s groundwater Stiff pattern distribution, by hydrogeologic unit. \n \nThe water samples from the central region of Santiago belong to the Na-HCO3 type, \nrevealing the refereed influence of the geological matrix volcanic rocks. That\u2019s where Bottom \nand Middle hydrogeologic Units dominate the landscape and most rainfall occurs. With low \nEC samples, marine aerosol influence was detected at recent underground shallow waters. \nBicarbonate existences are related to the Carbon Dioxide (CO2) reaction at unsaturated zone \ninfiltration and by dissolution of carbonate minerals and weathering silicate, later. That\u2019s \ncompatible with slightly acid and low EC new waters, (Pina, 2009). \n \nOver time, by gravity, water goes deeper and reacts with hosting siliceous rocks, becoming \nbicarbonate enriched and increasing pH value. The remaining ions also increase but water \nfacies stays similar. EC ranges from 440 to 2750 \u00b5S.cm-1 which is a low to medium value. \nSodium is the dominant cation, Bicarbonate and Chloride the dominant anions, by that order. \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n___________________________ \n\n 140\n\nThe Island\u2019s most productive hydrogeological unit, the Middle Unit, have poor mineralized \ngroundwater with HCO3-Cl-Na facies type. At pyroclastics deposit areas (MV formation) \nSodium enrichment is observed. Near the sea, water\u2019s facies from PA formation with intense \npumping boreholes is Cl dominated (> 2000 mg.L-1) plus Na (> 1300 mg.L-1). \n\nFigure 6.34 \u2013 a) Santiago\u2019s groundwater total dissolved salts distribution map, \n\nand  b) TDS versus seashore distance. \n \nThe Recent Unit has made by permeable and non consolidated materials, mostly in the \nstream valleys, where intense agriculture practices exist (e.g. sugar cane, banana and \npapaya fields). They are at low altitudes near the ocean, and some boreholes extraction \nscreens are under sea level. The dominant hydrochemical facies is Cl-Na, with high to very \nhigh EC values (2500 to 3000 \u00b5S.cm-1) and TDS (figure 6.34a and b). At this unit, some \nsamples have a Cl-Mg facies. \n \nAlthough, the Recent Unit has a limited storage capacity and most groundwater leak to \ndeeper levels (Middle Unit formations) or flows to the ocean, the valleys act as a recharge \nsue when strong rainfall happens. Throughout the valleys, there is some rainfall manmade \ncatchment structures, with 2 to 4 meter high walls to retain incoming superficial waters. Most \nof these small dams are nowadays already filled with sediment and rocky debris. Boreholes \nat these formations usually have a high-water production and non controlled over-extraction \nis becoming a problem, especially at dry years. \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n__________________________ \n\n 141\n\n \n\nFigure 6.35 \u2013 Santiago\u2019s groundwater chemical composition Piper pattern distribution \n\nby hydrogeologic unit, (modified from Pina (2009)). \n \n \nIsland groundwater composition can be also represented by Piper Diagram.

No especial \ncorrelation was found between the chemical evolution and the specific hydrogeologic unit. \nFigure 6.37 represents the diagrams of the major cations and anions. In the Na, Cl, and SO4 \ndata versus TDS graphs, only one evolution trend line is recognized, pointing out to mixture \nwith seawater or marine aerosol influence. However, in the Mg, Ca, HCO3 diagrams two \nevolution lines are identified after groundwater reach the 500 mg.L-1 TDS value, reflecting \none the water-rock interaction processes and the other, with a lower slope value, the \ninfluence of the seawater composition (mixing and/or aerosol), (Carreira et al., 2007a). \n \nThe high salt content within the groundwater systems appears to be restricted to agricultural \nareas in the valleys near the sea. The observed deterioration of the water quality limits its \nuse for Human supply and for irrigated agriculture. This brackish water leads to potential soil \nsalinization and alkalinisation, with the inherent soil deterioration and loss of productivity. \nSantiago\u2019s water supply is almost entirely from groundwater source origin (exceptions are \nseveral desalinization units used for towns supply and Poil\u00e3o catchment, used in the \nagriculture). Only one-third of those watersheds have freshwater (TDS &lt;500 mg.L-1), figure \n6.34b), the remaining sources surpass greatly that amount, remarkably the wells closest to \nthe sea. \n \n  \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n__________________________ \n\n 143\n\nFigure 6.37 \u2013 Santiago\u2019s major ions evolution in the groundwater samples as function of TDS. \n\n(Modified from Carreira et al.

One of the most used environmental isotopic analyses is the 2H and 18O pair. \nThey usually allow groundwater paths and fractioning to be followed. The fraction is mostly \nby evaporation and condensation process, (Custodio and Llamas, 2001). The 3H isotope \nmeasure is a technique to check recent age groundwater recharge. The piston-flow method \ncan be used, assuming that the tritium peak migrates through the aquifer and retains its \nshape when isotope time series measures are not available (Siegel and Jenkins, 1987). \n \n?\n\n2\nH versus ?\n\n18\nO \n\n \nThe 2H and 18O measure results are reported in ? notation, sample relative deviation against \nstandard VSMOW (Craig, 1961) and are given with the accuracy of 1\u2030 for ?2H and 0.1\u2030 for \n?\n\n18O. The ?2H and ?18O were determined by the Instituto de Tecnologia Nuclear (ITN) \nequipment using the methods proposed by Friedman (1953) to 2H measures and by Epstein \nand Mayeda (1953) to 18O measures (Carreira et al., 2007a). The observed groundwater \nmean isotopic composition at Santiago Island is given at table 6.14. The isotopic contents \nobtained are close to the average isotopic composition over the Island as discussed by Akiti \n(1985), suggesting that the infiltrated meteoric waters were not subjected too much \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n___________________________ \n\n 144\n\nevaporation, at most locations.

In S\u00e3o Nicolau and Fogo islands similar studies and results have \nbeen also published, by Olivry (1981) and Heilweil (2009), respectively. Studies show that \nLocal Meteoric Water Line (LMWL) is given by %&amp;H ? 8.32 \" %)*O ? 10.54 with mean \nweighted value of -36\u2030 for ?2H and -5.5 for ?18O.

But data can be shifted by a small amount. The altitude ?18O \nmeteoric gradient at tropical regions is known to be of ?1 to ?3\u2030 by km (e.g. Gonfiantini et \nal., 2001). This increase in isotopic depletion is generally attributed to the Rayleigh adiabatic \ncondensation process. Diagram of ?18O versus ?2H (figure 6.38) exhibit two groups of \ngroundwater samples: one group is composed by samples collected in the eastern side of \nSantiago Island (figure\u2019s lower group), in most cases located near the shoreline. The other \ngroup is ascribed to higher altitude and inland sampled locations. \n\nFigure 6.38 \u2013 ?18O versus ?2H plot. Two group samples trend lines are fitted, with GMWL and LMWL \n\nas guidelines. Black filed dots - boreholes, (modified from Carreira et al. (2007a)). \n \nBoth group samples have values under the GMWL and LMWL. The inland groundwater \nisotopic group\u2018s data can be explained by recharge\u2019s intensive meteoric events. Those \nevents have increased isotopic depletion. At the lower locations, the isotopic values suggest \na recharge mixture of rainfall and runoff water partially evaporated. It is not to exclude a \nstrong evapotranspiration through the unsaturated zone at agricultural land areas and the \nconsequent soil salt increase. This type of isotopic pattern was also mentioned by Akiti \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n__________________________ \n\n 145\n\n(1985). According to this author, the inland waters have similar isotopic history but different \ngeochemical history, which depend on the weathering and permeability of the hosting rocks. \n \nThe analyze of isotopic 18O data against the EC, TDS, Cl, SO4, Na and temperature content \nof the groundwater samples is plotted at figure 6.39. In these diagrams, two evolution lines \ncan be observed, one showing the influence/mixture with seawater with a progressive \nenrichment in 18O and in the mineralization where the influence of marine aerosol cannot be \nexcluded. No significant variation is detected with groundwater temperature. \n\nFigure 6.39 \u2013 ?18O versus  a) EC,  b) Cl,  c) SO4,  d) TDS,  e) Na  and  f) temperature. \n\n(Modified from Carreira et al.

The error associated with the 3H measurements varies with the \n3H sample\u2019s concentration, although usually is around 0.6 to 0.7 TU (Tritium Unit). Hydroarid \nproject measured values range between 0 \u00b1 0.7 TU and 3 \u00b1 0.7 TU (2005-2006 measures), \n(Carreira et al., 2007b). \n \nUnfortunately, no long series of 3H content in rainfall are available on the archipelago of \nCape Verde. In fact, face to the absence of 3H and the lower content found it is difficult to \npoint the turnover rates of the groundwater. To overcome this gap, 3H are usually compared \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n___________________________ \n\n 146\n\non the basis of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) network stations records at \nsimilar latitudes islands; Barbados, Ascension Island, St. Helena. Barmen et al. (1990) \nestimation of the natural background concentration of 3H in Cape Verde\u2019s precipitation was \nless than or equal to about 3 TU prior to 1953 and after 1990. Relatively large quantities of \nman produced 3H were introduced into the atmosphere by many thermonuclear testing in the \n1950s and 1960s. The estimated peak precipitation 3H concentrations in Cape Verde are \nabout 175 TU in 1964 (Kallr\u00e9n and Schreiber 1988). Observations show atmospheric 3H \nconcentrations at Santiago decreasing rapidly to less than about 5 TU during the 1980s, as \nindicated by five precipitation samples collected during 1984, with values from 2.3 \u00b1 0.1 to \n4.4 \u00b1 0.2 TU (Akiti 1985). One sample collected on nearby island of Fogo in 1987 had a 3H \nconcentration of 3.0 \u00b1 1 TU (Barmen et al. 1990). Recent values (2005) are from rain-fed \nonly agricultural products analyses at Fogo Island, with 3.0 and 1.0 TU (Heilweil et al., 2009)  \n \nThe measured maximum value of 3 \u00b1 0.7 TU can reflect water\u2019s age with a few years or a \nmixture with 3H enriched older water. Low Tritium values waters indicating even younger \nwaters. Tritium measures versus electric conductivity shows this trend, with younger \ngroundwater having high EC values (more salt content), figure 6.40. With this 3H data, no \ncorrelation was found against sampling altitudes and lithologic or hydrogeologic units. \n\nFigure 6.40 \u2013 Groundwater Tritium versus electric conductivity. \n\nThe associated error bar is plotted, (modified from Carreira et al. (2007b)). \n \nThe previous work of Akiti at Santiago, from 1984 to 1985, included measures of 3H and 14C. \nIn the north part of the island (Tarrafal region) Akiti obtain 0.2 \u00b1 0.2 and 1.0 \u00b1 0.2 TU at \nsprings and deep boreholes (150 to 200 m), showing that recharge water was prior to year \n1952. It means at least a residence time of 30 years and consequently, a limited groundwater \nrenewing capability. This result was confirmed by 14C borehole measures at the same region, \nwith groundwater ages greater than 30 years. In the eastern side (Achada Baleia), Akiti has \nmeasured 0.0 \u00b1 0.2 to 7.1 \u00b1 1.0 TU, respectively in boreholes and wells, (equivalent to a \ndecay-correction concentration of 2 TU by 2005). That means that wells received recent \nrecharge while the boreholes were receiving water slowly coming from joints and fractures. \nThe corresponding 14C analyses show that the major boreholes have relatively contemporary \nwaters. \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n__________________________ \n\n 147\n\n \nConclusions from the isotopic and hydrochemical waters composition is that groundwater at \nSantiago are naturally recharged by precipitation, which has not been subjected to \nevaporation (or was just minimal). The infiltration process is fast and existing fractures play a \nvery important role in that process. Shallow waters from wells are partly recharged by water \ncoming from runoff episodic floods in the stream valleys. The higher salt content and EC \nvalues observed at wells located very near the ocean are due to seawater intrusion. The high \nsalt content and EC values at deep borehole waters could mean also a salt water intrusion or \nsolid salt dissolution, as the groundwater movement at these lowest valley\u2019s regions, near \nthe sea, must have an upward component. \n \n \n6.7.9 \u2013 SAR index \n \nA significant amount of the groundwater extraction is applied into land irrigation. With only an \nannual short period of precipitation, irrigation is needed to support useful agriculture \npractices, especially to overcome the evaporation and transpirations\u2019 losses. The \npercentages of water in public distributions are: 44.2% to human consumption, 53.5% to \nirrigation (27.6 and 25.9%, respectively to traditional and drip irrigation) and only 2.3% to \nindustrial activities (INGRH). These are values of 2005, but percentages are roughly the \nsame throughout the decade, with an increasing trade between drip irrigation to traditional \none. Total official water amount was 4.479\u00d7106 m3. To this we have to add individual owners\u2019 \nwater extraction, mainly to irrigation purposes also. \n \nThe major concern with this groundwater used for irrigation are the decrease crop yields and \nland degradation as a result of excess salts present in water and in the soils. One of the \nparameters that can be useful to the agriculture land use management is the water sodium \ncontent, given by the Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR) index, altogether with groundwater EC \nand soil type. The SAR index value is a measure of the relative concentration of sodium to \ncalcium and magnesium. SAR is defined by the following expression, with cation\u2019s quantities \ngiven in meq per liter (Richards, 1954): \n \n\n     SAR ? 012\n34562278626\n\n    (6.4) \n\n \nThis measure of \u201cwater irrigation sodium hazard\u201d is important as the high sodium ion\u2019s \npresence in water affects the permeability of soil and causes infiltration problems. This \nhappens because sodium when present in the soil in the exchangeable form replaces the \ncalcium and magnesium adsorbed on the soil clays and causes dispersion of soil particles. \nThat is, if calcium and magnesium are the predominant cations adsorbed on the soil \nexchange complex, the soil tends to be easily cultivated and has a permeable and granular \nstructure. With this dispersion, the result is a breakdown of soil aggregates. The soil \nbecomes hard and compact when dry. This will reduce water infiltration to the soil surface \nand down the profile, and limit aeration, leading to reduced crop growth. (Adapted from \nANZECC).  \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n___________________________ \n\n 148\n\nWhen a high sodium concentration takes place it become a problem as the infiltration rate is \nreduced to such a rate that the vegetation and crop do not have enough water available. \nFurthermore, the hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile could become too low to provide \nadequate drainage. The plant extracts water from the soil by exerting an absorptive force \ngreater than that which holds the water to the soil particles. If the plant cannot make \nsufficient internal adjustment and exert enough force, it is not able to extract sufficient water \nand will suffer water stress. This happens when the soil becomes at a dry condition. Salt in \nthe soil-water increases the force the plant must exert to extract water (the osmotic effect or \nosmotic potential). Other problems caused by an excess of sodium is the formation of \ncrusting seed beds, temporary saturation of the surface soil, high pH and the increased \npotential for diseases, weeds, soil erosion, lack of oxygen and inadequate nutrient \navailability, (Adapted from ANZECC). \n \nAn infiltration problem occurs if the irrigation water does not enter the soil rapidly enough \nduring a normal irrigation cycle to replenish the soil with water needed by the crop before the \nnext irrigation and to avoid water stress. The reduced infiltration rate, if due to quality of \napplied water, is usually a problem within the upper few centimeters. The water infiltration \nproblem reduces the quantity of water put into the soil for later use by the crop. The soil and \nwater salinity reduces the availability of the water in storage (Rhoades, 1977; Oster and \nSchroer, 1979). \n \nBut sodium himself is not a discriminator. The SAR index needs to be associated to \ngroundwater EC and thus related with soil type. At the figures 6.41 and 6.42 are stated, \nthose relationships between SAR and EC measured values at Santiago Island springs, wells \nand boreholes groundwater, to the infiltration rate problem and soil structure stability. \n\nFigure 6.41 \u2013 Relative rate of water infiltration as affected by Santiago\u2019s groundwater calculated SAR \n\nand measured EC. (After Rhoades (1977); Oster and Schroer (1979)). \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n__________________________ \n\n 149\n\nActually, a newer index, the adjusted SAR (adj SAR) is defined (Suarez, 1981). It \nencompasses and offers a better insight into the change in calcium in the soil-water due to \naddition by dissolution of calcium from soil carbonates and silicates, or loss of calcium from \nsoil-water by precipitation as carbonates. The SAR value underpredicts by 10 to 20% the adj \nSAR value, but SAR index still are acceptable to irrigation problems analyses. \n \nFigure 6.41 shows that about half (55%) the groundwater characteristics have an \u201cinfiltration \nrate reduction problem\u201d, increasing the water loss by evaporation at irrigation. The same data \nis plotted against soil stability and the potential impact of irrigation water quality on soil \nstructure can be thus detected. Furthermore, about half the groundwater is suitable to land \nirrigation, not changing the soil structure stability. Comparison is done against standard \ncurves from DNR (1997). \n\nFigure 6.42 \u2013 Santiago\u2019s groundwater EC versus SAR to soil stability, with two \n\nsamples group identification, (adapted from DNR (1997)). \n\n \nSAR values range from 0.5 to 18.5 and EC from 362 to 16600 \u00b5S.cm-1. Although some \nscattering points, two distinct clusters are recognized at figure 6.41 and 6.42 (group, I and II). \nA closer analysis for each one reveals that group I data come from higher locations (75% are \nabove 100 m altitude) and group II data come mostly from lower regions (65% are below 100 \nm high). Threshold altitude difference is that below 100 m, soils belong to the alluvium \nQuaternary formation. Group II is in a stable soil condition but group I is conditioned by soil \ntype and problems can arise with irrigation. \n \nWith this observed SAR and EC groundwater values, the soil and crop types are essential to \nyield values. The salt content of the soil groundwater in the crop\u2019s root zone (the average \nroot zone salinity, ECR) is important in assessing which crops are suitable for growing in \nspecific soils and depend on those soils. The ECR is given at expression (6.5), function of \n\n\n\nSANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS \n___________________________ \n\n 150\n\nirrigation water EC and soil type by the average root zone leaching fraction (LF). The last \nvalue represents the proportion of applied water moving below the root zone, i. e. it \nrepresents the applied surface irrigation water fraction that percolates below the root zone. \nThe remaining value (1 - LF) replaces water used by the crop to meet its evapotranspiration \ndemand and water lost by surface evaporation. The LF value is higher at sand and sandy \nsoils (0,6) and lower to loam, light clay and heavy clay soils (0.33 to 0.2). \n \n\n     EC9 ? :;&amp;,&amp;\"=>     (6.5) \n \nafter Rhoades (1974) and Rhoades and Merrill (1976). \n \nTable 6.15 reports the ECR common accepted limits and rating for plant salt tolerance. \nTaking a mean value of 0.5 for the LF parameter (mixture of sandy and clayed soil), it gives \nthat about half data points locations (52%) can support sensitive to moderately sensitive \ncrops. Unfortunately, those places are located at higher altitudes. There the infiltration \nproblem is more intense (figure 6.43) and were a significant crop amount is irrigation rain \ndependent. \n\nTable 6.15 \u2013 Soil and water salinity criteria based on \n\nplant salt tolerance groupings, (after Maas, (1984)). \n\nPlant salt tolerance \n\ngrouping \n\nWater or soil \n\nsalinity rating \n\nAverage root zone \n\nsalinity, ECR / \u00b5S.cm\n-1\n\n \n\nsensitive crops very low &lt;950 \n\nmoderately sensitive crops low 950 to1900 \n\nmoderately tolerant crops medium 1900 to 4500 \n\ntolerant crops high 4500 to 7700 \n\nvery tolerant crops very high 7700 to 12200 \n\ngenerally too saline extreme > 12200 \n\n \nCrop salt tolerance needs to be taken into account when assessing the suitability of water \nand soil for irrigation.

The \n\nrelation of hydrogeologic parameters to the obtained geoelectric models is advanced, as also \n\nthe relation with groundwater quality. \n\n \n\n \n\n7.1 \u2013 TEM soundings at Santiago \n \n\nTransient electromagnetic soundings were acquired at the most important creek valleys and \n\nagricultural areas of Santiago Island, figure 7.1. The majority of these sampled valleys are \n\nlocated at island east side; S. Domingos (near Achada Baleia village), Seca and Picos (near \n\nPedra Badejo village), Salto, Flamengos and S Miguel (near Calheta de S. Miguel village). At \n\nthe northwest island side near Tarrafal village, two more sites were covert; at Ch\u00e3o Bom \n\nplateau (a one kilometre square agricultural area near the sea) and Ribeira Grande creek \n\nvalley. All these creeks only possess superficial waters at the \u201crain season\u201d from respective \n\nhydrographic basin catchment runoff. Near the ocean, valleys are filled with alluvium \n\nQuaternary sediments and these soils are the best ones for agriculture. Most of these \n\nchosen valleys are intensely farmed throughout the year (S. Miguel and Ribeira Grande to a \n\nlesser extent) as the irrigation water is mostly from local wells and borehole groundwater \n\nextraction. At the remaining island rural areas, where no groundwater pumping or net \n\ndistribution water exists, the agriculture practices are rain-fed based only. \n\n \n\nThe TEM soundings have been acquired at several campaigns, between the year 2005 and \n\n2009 (see table 7.1). The principal areas were surveyed at June 2005, November 2005 and \n\nSeptember 2006. At every next campaign, repetitions at some of the previous places have \n\nbeen also done. From year 2007 onward only this sounding\u2019s repetitions took place. A few \n\nmore soundings were done; at Campelo (to the south of Salto valley) over some previous \n\nVLF-EM profiles (Summer 2005) and at Assomada central plateau for static shift \n\nmagnetoteluric correction (September 2006), (Santos et al., 2006). When possible, \n\nrepetitions were exactly at the same sounding spot. Not being so, as closest as possible. The \n\nmajor and principal surveys took 4 to 5 days field work. Repetitions last only just 2 to 3 days. \n\n \n\nTable 7.1 \u2013 Calendar for the several TEM campaigns, surveyed places and amounts. \n\n(R marks the repetition TEM soundings). \n\nDate S.Dom.

Domingos data \n \n\nS\u00e3o Domingos stream valley is the southernmost of the surveyed locations. It\u2019s nearby \n\nAchada Baleia village. At surveyed area, the valley is 300 to 400 m wide with 30 to 40 m \n\nhillside and 15 to 20 degree slope walls. Soundings were taken from near the ocean, at 2 m \n\namsl to 2100 m inland and 34 m high. Creek bed altitude grows steadily from the sea. A few \n\nsoundings were done outside the valley. Hydrographic catchment basin covers 31.3 km\n2\n. \n\n \n\nInformation from valley\u2019s borehole logs indicates a mean 12 m alluvium thickness over the \n\nPA basaltic formations, at the valley centre. The basaltic formations are fractured and have \n\nsometimes pyroclastics intrusions and clays. Deepest drilled borehole goes to 46 m below \n\nthe mean sea level. No direct geologic information is known beyond this limit. Agriculture \n\npractices exist in the valley, except the last 500 m near the sea. Production of green \n\nvegetables is declining especially at this nearest to shoreline valley area. \n\nFigure 7.2 \u2013 TEM soundings number and location at S. Domingos, over simple geologic map \n\ndescription; PA \u2013 Pico da Ant\u00f3nia formation, a \u2013 Quaternary alluvium formations. \n\n \n\nAcquisition of TEM soundings (and respective numbering) starts from the shoreline \n\nthroughout the axis valley. The majority of the TEM-FAST 48 soundings were acquired with a \n\n25 m \u00d7 25 m single loop wire, with a mean current of 3.0 ampere and time channel from 4 to \n\n9 (maximum). The soundings\u2019 location is shown at figure 7.2 together with the simple \n\ngeology sketch of the region. The loop dimension was primarily chosen to have a better \n\nsuperficial accuracy and smaller 3D effect over soundings (Goldman et al., 1994; \n\nRabinovich, 1995), and to survey the know aquifer. Figure 7.3 plots the TEM soundings\u2019 \n\nlocations plus the boreholes and wells (with lithologic and chemical information) over a \n\nphotographic image (Google image).  \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n__________________________________ \n\n 156\n\nFigure 7.3 \u2013 TEM soundings, boreholes and wells location at S. Domingos valley, \n\n(adapted from Google images), \n\n \n\nThe figures 7.4 a) to c) display the characteristic S. Domingos valley landscape scenario and \n\nenvironment. \n\n \n\nAn initial inspection of the TEM apparent resistivity curves show that the medium is \n\nconductor to highly conductor, i.e. the measured apparent resistivity has low to very low \n\nvalues. Krigged overall distribution of apparent resistivity for eight increasing time windows \n\nafter the turnoff (and increasingly depth) is plotted in figures 7.5 to 7.8. The measured \n\napparent resistivity increases inland upstream. This observed effect could arise from different \n\nsources; effectively freshwater to seawater mixture, altogether with a bending alluvium \n\nsubstratum (thinner alluvium near the sea) or some added effect over the normal transient \n\ninduction process. Notably, all these issues can be presents at this geologic scenario, plus \n\nsome lateral effects, i.e. some 2D or 3D effects. \n\n \n\nFirst results came from 1D data modelling and model analyses. The resistivity of the deepest \n\nlayer is similar to seawater typical values of 0.3-0.4 to 1.0 ohm.m, in many models. This \n\nwould imply a water brine condition or localized 3D effect at some soundings. A closer \n\ninspection of the decay induction signal reveals also that signal is affected by SPM, most \n\nprobably from magnetite, maghemite or hematite content of shallow sedimentary formation \n\nnear the sea. Previously studies found those minerals (Martins, 2003). A superficial sand \n\nsample (from Seca region beach) was also analyzed, confirming this magnesian based \n\nmineral\u2019s presence (Jo\u00e3o Coroado, personal communication), figure 7.9a) and 7.9b). \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n__________________________________ \n\n 157\n\n \nFigure 7.4 a) \u2013 Photography at S.

Below \n\nthis depth, resistivity corresponding to the aquifer system is around 10 to 20 ohm.m. \n\nFigure 7.12 \u2013 S. Domingos 1D TEM mean models (corresponding to figure 7.10 soundings). \n\nFigure 7.13 \u2013 Boreholes lithologic description data at S. Domingos valley, (from INGRH data). \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n__________________________________ \n\n 164\n\nAt roughly 70-80 m depth (at soundings depth limit) a highly conductive substratum is \n\ndetected in the majority of the soundings throughout the valley. This is the cause of the \n\nobserved continuous decreasing of apparent resistivity curves. The most reasonable \n\nexplanation is that this phenomenon might be related to clay saturated layer with fossil saline \n\nwater (Goldman et al., 1991). Clays have a very low hydraulic conductivity, and all these \n\nlayer levels were under seawater in the past. This could be the cause for the high degree of \n\nsalinization after long time over-extraction of boreholes far from the sea. \n\n \n\nNear the shoreline, the typical freshwater-seawater interface is detected, as can be seen in \n\nthe 1D sounding models shown in figure 7.14 (TEM sounding AB 9 is 550 m from the sea). \n\nThe interface calculated by the Ghyben-Herzberg or Todd relations for stagnant seawater \n\n(Bear et al., 1999) are in accordance with the measured fresh water (brackish water) levels \n\nat this area. The water table level measured in wells is around 1 to 2 m high above the sea \n\nlevel. The assumed interface is shown in the resistivity cross section (figure 7.15). \n\n \n\nFigure 7.14 \u2013 TEM sounding mean models from near the ocean (AB 1) to inland (AB 9). \n\n \n\nThe quasi-2D cross sections were assembled from the 1D sounding models (figures 7.15 \n\nand 7.16). These cross sections are taken from AEMR TEM inversion software, and aren\u2019t \n\nreally a 2D data inversion nor a 1D inversion with laterally constrains (LCI) as written at \n\nchapter 3. Models are stitched-together into a section, and lateral continuity is guarantied by \n\nsimple interpolation between each model. With this procedure, it\u2019s possible to delineate the \n\nlayered structures in the valley, although some local 3D effects can be present. Shallow \n\nburied small rock debris from ancient runoff events and wall\u2019s erosion effects are greatly \n\nsmoothed in the TEM process. \n\n \n\nThe resistivity cross section along the axis of the valley and starting from the sea is shown in \n\nfigure 7.15. The fresh sea water interface is seen at cross section right side. An upper \n\nconductive layer at roughly 15 to 20 m depth bellow surface and thicker near the sea is seen. \n\nThe resistivity increases going inland and seems to have lateral continuity coming from the \n\nsea. It must be separated from bottom freshwater by an impermeable clay layer. At the \n\nbottom, 60 m bellow the mean sea level a conductive layer is present and extent all over the \n\nvalley. That is shown in three perpendicular middle valley cross sections (figure 7.16 a) and \n\nb)). The BB\u2019 cross section exhibit a step like structure in the north side, that is, the conductive \n\nlayer is closer to the surface. This is an uncommon behaviour and a local 3D effect is not to \n\nexclude as an explanation of this feature.  \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n__________________________________ \n\n 165\n\nTo check and confirm these resistivity values and lateral continuity of layers, a quasi-3D \n\nmodelling was done with the data soundings. \n\nFigure 7.15 \u2013 Resistivity axial valley cross section from 1D sounding models.

Domingos quasi-3D data inversion \n \n\nThe quasi-3D modelling was calculated with a spatially-constrained-inversion algorithm (SCI) \n\nthat uses the 1D approach in forward calculations (Santos, personal communication; Santos, \n\n2011a and 2011b). As usual, model parameters are the logarithmic resistivity of the layers \n\nbeneath each sounding site. The number of layers can be chosen. On the several modelling \n\ntests made in this thesis they have varied between 13 and 19 layers. The incremental depth \n\nis exponential, starting with a shallow 2 m layer and a step of 2??,?????\t?\n to the n\nth\n thickness \n\nlayer. Total number of resistivity model parameters to fit is a function of the number of layers\u2019 \n\nand soundings. \n\n \n\nA total of 38 TEM soundings was used at S. Domingos. The number of time channels used in \n\nthe inversion and fit of each sounding was unequal. They were decimated and vary from just \n\n10 to 21 data points per soundings. The starting initial models were always a resistivity \n\nuniform half space. \n\n \n\nThe effective distance constrain (EDC) parameter between soundings can be also modified. \n\nIt can be set to zero and thus the inversion is regardless of surrounding ones. Or it can be \n\nextended (by 6 steeps) to encompass nearby models. With the spatial spreading of \n\nsoundings in S. Domingos valley, the maximum constrained distance was around 320 m. \n\nNear the sea and far from it, at beginning and ending of axial profile, the number of TEM \n\nsoundings is smaller, and they are far apart each other. The overall mean distance between \n\nsoundings is 125 m. At mid valley they are clustered and inversion results are expected to be \n\nbetter in this part. Many inversion tests were carried out changing the initial damping factor \n\nparameter (?), as also the number of layers and the maximum depth of investigation, the \n\nneighbours sounding distance and stopping convergence criteria (final iteration and rms \n\nnumbers). \n\nFigure 7.17 \u2013 Mean rms quasi-3D models misfit and iteration number (blue square), and cumulative \n\nsounding pair number (red square) for several constrained distances at S. Domingos valley. \n\nInitial damping factor set to 0.1 and 15 layers with 10 ohm.m model space. \n\n \n\nA maximum of 60 iterations and a 0.01 rms value for stopping the calculations were \n\nadequate with a starting homogeneous resistivity model of 10 (or 20) ohm.m. The output \n\nresults with 15 layers (till 80 m deep) are better than just only 13 layers (till 60 m deep). This \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n__________________________________ \n\n 167\n\nconcern to edge conditions and measured data values. The global model\u2019s misfit is worse \n\nwhen the EDC distance parameter is turned off (around 4% error) and stays slightly under \n\n3% when neighbours influence is considered. The smaller distance influence value was 54 \n\nm. Figure 7.17 give the mean final rms misfit value and iteration number to such allowed \n\ninfluence distances, with the same starting conditions, as also the increasingly sounding\u2019s \n\npairs number under EDC. This behaviour might indicate a rather smooth horizontal changing \n\nmedium, and that misfit are limited by data errors. Each inversion\u2019s run takes around 15 to 20 \n\nminutes maximum computing time (dual-core 2.6 GHz CPU and 2 GB memory machine). \n\nFigure 7.18 \u2013 Some S.

The quasi-2D \n\nmodel structure is quite similar to the previous stitched 1D results. This can also be seen in \n\nthe perpendicular cross sections (figure 7.21), with the high conductive bottom layer and \n\naquifer bulk resistivity values from 10 to 20 ohm.m. The low resistivity bottom layer is placed \n\nsomewhat closer to surface beneath sounding 20 in the section BB\u2019. \n\n \n\nFigure 7.20 \u2013 Axial resistivity 2D cross section from quasi-3D model, at S Domingos valley. \n\n \n\nFigure 7.21 \u2013 Perpendicular resistivity 2D cross sections from quasi-3D model, at S Domingos valley. \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n__________________________________ \n\n 169\n\n \n\n7.1.2 \u2013 Seca and Picos data \n \n\nThe Seca and Picos creek valleys are located 10 km to the north of S. Domingos valley, near \n\nSanta Cruz village (figure 7.1). These two contiguous valleys show a similar morphology to \n\nthe previous one with the difference of being much wider. At the coastline the joint valley end \n\nspan for some 1300 m wide. A few kilometres inland, they attain together some 3500 m wide. \n\nThese two hydrographic catchment basins are the biggest ones at Santiago, with 49.9 and \n\n71.5 km\n2\n, for Pico and Seca, respectively. Floods are frequent at rainy season, as both \n\nbasins include the central mountains where intense precipitation happens as recharge areas. \n\nTEM soundings have been carried out from the shoreline (at roughly 3 to 4 m amsl) to 3300 \n\nand 2000 m inland at 29 and 25 m high, for Seca and Picos valleys, respectively. Again, the \n\ncreek bed altitude grows steadily from the sea. A few soundings have also been done, to the \n\nsoutheast, outside the Seca valley. \n\n \n\nInformation from borehole logs in the valleys indicates a mean 25 m thick shallow basaltic \n\nalluvium with pebbles, resting over the fractured PA basaltic formation. Sandy and clayed \n\nlayer\u2019s intercalations exist between these two formations. Deepest drilled boreholes reach \n\nabout 55 m below the mean sea level. No direct geologic information is known beyond this \n\nlimit. Intense agriculture activities take place at both valleys, except in the last couple of \n\nhundred meters from the sea. At Picos valley a considerable large area is devoted to banana \n\nproduction. The situation is analogous to that in the S. Domingos valley with vegetable\u2019s \n\nproductivity declining near the shoreline. \n\n \n\nFigure 7.22 \u2013 TEM soundings location and number order at Seca and Picos valleys.

Figure 7.27 shows the respective \n\n1D mean model for the TEM soundings shown in figure 7.26. The majority of the curves \n\ndecrease smoothly to low apparent resistivity values. At some locations, there is a \n\nconductive layer, roughly at 15 to 20-30 m depth. This is in accordance with some lithologic \n\nlogging information from boreholes, as can be seen in figure 7.28. At and below this depth, \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n__________________________________ \n\n 174\n\nelectric resistivity corresponding to the aquifer formations is around 10 to 20 ohm.m.

This structure seems to be separated from the lower freshwater by an \n\nimpervious clay layer. Far from the coastline the superficial resistivities are higher, but at \n\nbottom, 40 to 50 m bellow the mean sea level a conductive layer is present and extent all \n\nover the valley.  \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n__________________________________ \n\n 176\n\n \n\n7.1.2.2 \u2013 Seca 2D data inversion \n \n\nThe same spatially constrained algorithm has been applied to the soundings acquired in the \n\nSeca valley. As TEM soundings are along a line, the result can be approached to a 1D \n\ninversion with only laterally constrains (LCI). The overall mean distance between soundings \n\nwas 175 m. Several inversion tests had been carried out, changing initial damping factor (?), \n\ndifferent number of layers and different EDC values. \n\n \n\nA maximum of 40 iterations and a 0.02 rms value with a starting homogeneous resistivity \n\nmodel of 10 (or 20) ohm.m were adequate, with 15 layer model (till 80 m deep). Figure 7.30 \n\ndisplay the mean rms misfit versus maximum iteration number and number of pairs of \n\nsoundings under EDC, all with the same starting conditions. The number of soundings within \n\nEDC grows up almost linearly with that parameter.

The former studies comprise \n\na 4 km long MT profile (9 stations) and several shorter VLF-EM ones, approximately oriented \n\nSE to NW and parallel to the coastline at 1 to 2 km way from it. A full description of this work; \n\nequipment, data processing and results are given in Santos el al.

Although the broad-band MT method is being unsuited to investigate very \n\nshallow structures (less than 100 m deep), the resistivity values near the surface and also at \n\nmajor depths, have low values, especially beneath the valleys. The resistivity values are \n\naround 5 to 10 ohm.m, and these deeper structures could be related to the valley fault \n\ngenesis and may be linked to some regional conductive groundwater up flow. \n\n \n\n \n\n7.1.3 \u2013 Tarrafal and Ribeira Grande data \n \n\nThe Ch\u00e3o Bom in Tarrafal, is a flat area near the ocean, at the northwest side of Santiago \n\nIsland. The Ribeira Grande stream valley is located just to the south of Tarrafal. The major \n\ndifference to the remaining places is that Ch\u00e3o Bom is intensively farmed since many \n\ndecades and is not crossed by any creek or stream system. It has approximately one square \n\nkilometre surface, with elevation from 5 to 20 m above msl. Several areas within Ch\u00e3o Bom \n\nhad been severely affected by local salty water irrigation and were temporally abandoned. \n\nNowadays, the situation is slowly reversing, with less salty water irrigation, as most of it \n\ncomes from nearby mountain\u2019s sources. The corresponding hydrographic catchment basin \n\nas 7.5 km\n2\n, \n\n \n\nThe Ch\u00e3o Bom area is almost entirely covered by an alluvial deposit, surrounded (and \n\noverlying) by the PA formations (figure 7.43). This alluvium is manly formed by flood debris \n\ndeposits with elements of a great variety in composition as well as in size and shape. This \n\ninformation comes from several lithological borehole descriptions at Tarrafal region (Dahlin et \n\nal., 1986 and INGRH). Superficial soil and alluvium are thinner with just a couple of meters at \n\nthe south side of studied area, and have some six meters tick at the north side. In the \n\nsouthern area, under the initial layer, some pillow lava and scoria detritus are followed by \n\nfractured basalt until 28 m depth. From this level to 48 m depth, consolidated sandy alluvium \n\nis observed, being slightly clayey to the bottom. Bellow this, fragments of pillow lava exist. In \n\nthe northern side and after the initial layer, a succession of fractured basalt with scoria and \n\nscoria layers exist until 49 m depth, sometimes with clayed inclusions. At Ribeira Grande, a \n\nstream valley with 20 to 30 m hillside high walls, the layers\u2019 successions are almost entirely \n\nformed by altered and fewer altered basalts, with some clayed inclusions. Deepest drilled \n\nborehole at area goes to 35 m below the mean sea level. No direct geologic information is \n\nknown beyond this limit. The Ribeira Grande hydrographic catchment basin covers 21.0 km\n2\n, \n\n \n\nThe TEM survey has covered the agricultural area from the Tarrafal village limits, at north \n\nand east, to the coastline. In Ribeira Grande, soundings have been carried out from the \n\nseashore upstream the valley to 2 km m inland, and to 75 m elevation. The majority of the \n\nTEM-FAST 48 soundings were acquired with a 25 m \u00d7 25 m single loop wire, with a \n\nmaximum current input of 3.0 ampere and time channel set to the maximum (9). The \n\nsoundings\u2019 location is shown at figure 7.43, over a regional geological map. Figure 7.44 \n\nshows the TEM soundings\u2019 location plus the boreholes and wells (with lithologic and \n\nchemical information) over a photographic image (Google image).  \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n__________________________________ \n\n 185\n\nFigure 7.43 \u2013 TEM soundings number and location at Tarrafal and Ribeira Grande valley.

In figures 7.46 \n\nto 7.49 the overall krigged apparent resistivity distribution is mapped for eight increasing time \n\nwindows after the turnoff. Inland, far from the coastline at higher places, the apparent \n\nresistivity values are high at the shallow depths and decrease towards the shoreline (lower \n\nelevation). The late time registered windows (deeper layers) have low apparent resistivity \n\nvalues all over the Ch\u00e3o Bom area. Near the northeast extreme, the very low apparent \n\nresistivity values linked to TEM number 11 are due to a disturbing coupling effect in the late \n\ntime records (figures 7.48 and 7.49).

Measured noise was also in the 3 nVm\n-2\n level \n\nbut at some places unusual greater noise was registered. That\u2019s most probably caused by \n\nlocally grounded metallic fences. A couple of soundings had shown a resonant signal, easily \n\nsmoothed during the inversion process. \n\nFigure 7.50 \u2013 Some Ch\u00e3o Bom and Ribeira Grande TEM curves and 1D mean model fit response. \n\n \n\nModel\u2019s response misfits have a mean of 3 to 4%. Figure 7.51 shows the respective 1D \n\nmean model of the TEM soundings in figure 7.50. Most soundings exhibit high resistivity \n\nlayers, with resistivity of 100 ohm.m or grater, from top to 20 to 30 m deep. Bellow this depth \n\nthe bulk resistivity is clearly dominated by groundwater saturated layers. Measures at \n\nboreholes show that groundwater level is around 1 to 2 m above msl at 1 km inland (e.g. \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n__________________________________ \n\n 190\n\nSST-34 borehole) and near the sea level at the coastline (e.g. SST-32). The nearest \n\nsounding to borehole SST-34 is TEM 10 (figure 7.52). From the TEM model of this sounding \n\nit can be seen that the resistivity of 10 ohm.m corresponds to brackish and that deeper layer \n\nwith 2.5 ohm.m resistivity corresponds to layers containing salty water. The measured \n\ngroundwater resistivity was 4 ohm.m (1.3 mg.L\n-1\n TDS) to less than 0.3 ohm.m. \n\nFigure 7.51 \u2013 Ch\u00e3o Bom and Ribeira Grande 1D TEM mean models, corresponding to figure 7.48 \n\nsoundings. \n\n \n\nFigure 7.52 \u2013 Ch\u00e3o Bom TEM 10 sounding model, closet to SST-34 borehole. \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n__________________________________ \n\n 191\n\nThe borehole lithology is represented below, in figure 7.53. As already mentioned most of the \n\nregion is formed by fractured basalt, except in the southern area of Ch\u00e3o Bom plateaux, with \n\nsome 20 m thick alluvium. Above the sea and at water saturated level, the majority of the \n\nmeasured and modelled high resistivity values (>100 ohm.m) correspond to unsaturated or \n\ndry fractured basalt and scoria layers with some clay inclusions. These high resistivity layer\u2019s \n\nvalues are usually the less determined model parameters (not well constrained) by the TEM \n\nmethod, with an ambiguity of 100 to 200% (e.g. Kafri and Goldman, 2005). \n\n \n\nFigure 7.53 \u2013 Boreholes lithologic description at Ch\u00e3o Bom, (Dahlin et al. (1986), and INGRH data). \n\n \n\nThese high resistivity values confirm the results of a previous field study done at Ch\u00e3o Bom \n\nregion by Dahlin et al. (1986). In the study (February 1986) VES resistivity measures \n\n(Schlumberger array), were done near the uncased (at that time) boreholes SST32, SST33 \n\nand SST34. Measures have been done in two perpendicular directions. Figure 7.54 shows \n\nthose soundings curves as well their corresponding resistivity models, for each perpendicular \n\ndirection. \n\n \n\nThe depth of the layers has been fixed by the borehole lithology data, as the two different \n\ndirection\u2019s VES models show discrepancies between them (Dahlin et al., 1986). These \n\ndifferences are due to the lateral effects originated by the inhomogeneous superficial \n\ngeology, like blocks or stones, scattered throughout the area. In this (deep) conductive \n\nenvironment VES investigation is greatly shortened, and soundings are less effective to solve \n\nthose deeper resistivity values. \n  \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n__________________________________ \n\n 192\n\nFigure 7.54 \u2013 VES data at Ch\u00e3o Bom (Tarrafal) and 1D resistivity models (from Dahlin et al.

It\u2019s also noted a huge difference between the resistivity values \n\nassigned to the bottom layer in VES and TEM models. That is explained when a comparison \n\nbetween both data sets is done using Meju\u2019s scaling relationship (subchapter 4.3.1). Indeed, \n\na considerable static shift exists as can be seen in figure 7.55, where the nearest TEM and \n\nVES soundings are compared. Although both data sets were acquired at different years and \n\nepochs, they have been done following the dry \u201crain season\u201d condition of 1985 and 2005. \n  \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n__________________________________ \n\n 193\n\nFigure 7.55 \u2013 Apparent resistivity VES (Dahlin et al., 1986).and TEM scaled data points \n\ncomparison at Ch\u00e3o Bom (Tarrafal). \n\n \n\nSeveral resistivity cross sections were built using the 1D models calculated in the Ch\u00e3o Bom \n\nand Ribeira Grande valley. As previously, the same procedure was applied stitching together \n\nthe 1D models, as can be seen in the next pages (figure 7.56 and 7.57). Resistivity cross \n\nsections are all plotted to the same resistivity colour scale. The profile location and direction \n\nare shown in figure 7.58. \n\n \n\nThe overall resistivity structure at Ch\u00e3o Bom starts with high values (100 to 200 ohm.m) and \n\n20 m thick layer, matching dry basalts or quaternary alluvium. It is noted that the resistivity of \n\nthis upper layer decreases towards the shoreline. The next layer, with resistivity range of 10 \n\nto 20 ohm.m is mainly associated to the brackish water. Beneath this, the resistivity drops to \n\n1 to 2 ohm.m. This value is associated to salty water filling the pores/fractures of the rock \n\n(actual seawater or fossil water remains). As previously, the uniform horizontal continuity of \n\nresistivity layers from the first sounding towards the sea is just a graphical effect. \n  \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n__________________________________ \n\n 194\n\nFigure 7.56 \u2013 Resistivity cross section at Ch\u00e3o Bom (perpendicular to the coastline), \n\nfrom 1D sounding models (top to bottom corresponds from north to south section). \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n__________________________________ \n\n 195\n\nFigure 7.57 \u2013 Resistivity cross section at Ch\u00e3o Bom (parallel to the coastline), from 1D sounding \n\nmodels (top to bottom corresponds from inland to shoreline section). \n\n \n\nThere is a difference between the Ch\u00e3o Bom northern and southern areas. The superficial \n\nlayer is thicker and resistive in the southern part decreasing its resistivity towards the \n\ncoastline. The most relevant and odd structural aspect from data, is that the deeper \n\nconductive layer (1 to 2 ohm.m resistivity) absolute level seems to get shallow inland. \n\nConsidering the measured groundwater level and under a steady-state water flux condition, \n\nthe theoretical position of the Ghyben-Herzberg freshwater-seawater interface is about 42 m \n\nbelow the mean sea level at sites nearest to the coastline. As the groundwater level \n\nincreases inland, that interface would be increasingly deeper. \n\n \n\nResults from TEM soundings contradict this last assumption; they show that the conductive \n\nlayer is roughly sub-horizontal and approaches the surface instead, as we go inland. \n\nConsecutively the low resistivity feature seems to be not linked to actual seawater intrusion \n\nbut also to some high conductive lithologic layer. The same structure is detected upstream at \n\nRibeira Grande valley cross section (figure 7.59). The thickness of this layer is difficult to \n\nquantify, because it is almost at the soundings\u2019 depth investigation limit. In theory, with the \n\navailable field data, it could be two or three tens of meters and can overlay a more resistive \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n__________________________________ \n\n 196\n\nlayer (? 10 ohm.m or more). The differences at the late time in the soundings curves would \n\nbe very small and wrapped by the signal noise. \n\n \n\nFigure 7.58 \u2013 Cross section location map at Tarrafal; Ch\u00e3o Bom plateaux and Ribeira Grande sream. \n\nThe geologic map explanation is given at caption in figure 7.16 b). \n\n \n\n \n\n7.1.3.2 \u2013 Ch\u00e3o Bom 3D data modelling \n \n\nThe soundings at Ch\u00e3o Bom have been also inverted using the spatially constrained \n\nalgorithm, a quasi-3D approximation. TEM sounding\u2019s spatial locations are more or less \n\nuniform over the area. The overall mean distance between soundings was 205 m. Several \n\nmodelling inversion tests had been carried out, changing the initial damping factor (?), the \n\ndifferent number of layer and different EDC values. \n\n \n\nThe following results were achieved with a maximum of 40 iterations, rms value of 0.02 and a \n\nstarting homogeneous model with resistivity of 10 ohm.m and 16 layers (until 92 m deep). \n\nFigure 7.60 shows the final mean rms misfit variations with EDC parameter. The output for \n\nthe first EDC value (45 m) is equivalent to a single sounding inversion (EDC set to zero). \n\nThat\u2019s because there aren\u2019t soundings so close. With greater EDC values, models fit are \n\nslightly worsened because only a few soundings are included in the constraints. Beyond the \n\nmean inter sounding\u2019s distance much more soundings are taking into account and \n\nincreasingly better model\u2019s fits outcome. \n\n \n\nFrom this quasi-3D modelling a few 1D model results and corresponding soundings\u2019 data fits \n\nare presented below, in figures 7.61 and 7.62.

Miguel data \n \n\nSalto, Flamengos and S. Miguel valleys are located 10 km to the north of Seca and Picos \n\nones, near Calheta de S. Miguel village (figure 7.1). Salto and S. Miguel valleys are very \n\nnarrow near the sea, with 300 and 150 m wide, respectively. Near the shoreline, Salto valley \n\nis limited by a 70 m hillside at north with a slope of 20 to 30 degrees and a gentler slope and \n\nless high south hillside. Inland, the valley spans wide to some 1.5 km. The hydrographic \n\ncatchment in Salto covers around 12.4 km\n2\n. The S. Miguel valley is limited at both, north and \n\nsouth by 50 m hillside with slopes of 20 degrees. Inland, the valley spans from 500 m wide to \n\n1.5 km wide. S. Miguel hydrographic catchment covers 14.4 km\n2\n. The Flamengos valley has \n\n300 m side to side at the coastline, but it is wider with 1000 m between hillsides going inland. \n\nThose hillsides can reach 100 m above the valley floor with a slope of 30 degrees. The \n\nhydrographic catchment covers 30.5 km\n2\n. The three basins head starts are contiguous to the \n\nSerra da Malagueta mountain, one of the island regions with intense rainfall. Floods are \n\nfrequent at these valleys in the course of the rainy season. All these valley creek beds are \n\nrelatively flat and slowly increase the altitude with the upper creek course. \n\n \n\nFigure 7.64 \u2013 TEM soundings number and location at Salto, Flamengos and S. Miguel valleys. \n\nGeologic map explanation is the same as given at caption in figure 7.16 b). \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n__________________________________ \n\n 201\n\nTEM soundings were acquired throughout the valley axis from the coastline, at roughly 6 m \n\nabove msl, to 3500, 1600 and 3700 m inland, at 70, 20 and 100 m high, for Salto, Flamengos \n\nand S. Miguel, respectively. TEM sounding\u2019s locations, with the numbering order starting all \n\nfrom the coastline and increasing upper creek valleys, are shown in figure 7.64, over the \n\nregional geology map. Soundings are also plotted over a photographic image (Google \n\nimage), with the locations of boreholes and wells where lithologic and chemical groundwater \n\ndata do exist (figure 7.65). \n\n \n\nFigure 7.65 \u2013 TEM soundings, boreholes and wells location at Salto, Flamengos and S. Miguel \n\nvalleys, (adapted from Google images). \n\n \n\nBorehole logs data from these valleys indicate a somewhat different geologic setting, when \n\ncompared with those previously described. The Quaternary alluvium formation is very \n\nshallow and thinner, except to the downstream locations, that is, near shoreline. Together \n\nwith the common basalt structures (more or less fractured) there are also pillow lava and \n\ngreenish tuff layers. The deepest drilled borehole goes to 35 m below the mean sea level, \n\nand no direct geologic knowledge exists beyond this depth. \n\n \n\nConcerning the agriculture activities, they exist on those valleys but are restricted to the \n\nareas near the coastline at Salto and S. Miguel valleys. At Flamengos valley this agriculture \n\npractices extent further inland, to a couple of kilometres from the coastline. \n\n \n\nIn figures 7.66 a) to c) it is showed the typical Salto and S. Miguel valley landscape scenario \n\nand environment. The landscape at Flamengos valley is not too much different. \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n__________________________________ \n\n 202\n\nFigure 7.66 a) \u2013 Photography at Salto, near TEM sounding 5, facing southwest. \n\n \n\nFigure 7.66 b) \u2013 Detailed photography of 0.5 m high flood debris in Salto, near TEM sounding 7. \n\n \n\nFigure 7.66 c) \u2013 Photography at S.

The corresponding measured TEM data field \n\ncurves and also the 1D mean fit response, is shown bellow (figure 7.67), for six of the twenty \n\nfour acquired soundings. \n\nFigure 7.67 \u2013 Some Salto measured TEM curves and 1D mean model fit response. \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n__________________________________ \n\n 204\n\nMisfits have a mean 2 to 3%. Figure 7.68 shows the respective 1D mean model of the \n\nsounding in figure 7.67.

Comparison \n\nbetween 1D models (figure 7.69) and the borehole lithology description (figure 7.70), shows \n\na resistivity variation in 10 to 15 m depth, from higher to 10 ohm.m (TEM 11 and 13). This \n\nrepresents the groundwater level at the bottom of the superficial pillow lava layer (at \n\nunsaturated conditions). At these two soundings and bellow this position, only a deeper and \n\nless resistive layer (around 4 ohm.m) is detected, not having a correspondent geological \n\nchanging in borehole description (FT 45 and TEM 11 are 100 m apart). At TEM 16 site, no \n\npillow lava layers exist, instead we have greenish tuff, basalt and fractured basalt. \n\nGroundwater level coincides with the change in resistivity from lower to 6 ohm.m. The low \n\nresistivity values can be from altered tuff, probably with clay. Below this, at roughly 40 m \n\ndepth, the resistivity increases probably due to the lithology change from tuff layer to basaltic \n\nand tuff layers. \n\n \n\nThe groundwater level measures give a mean hydraulic gradient of 0.012. \n  \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n__________________________________ \n\n 205\n\nWith all these 1D TEM models, a stitched cross section was built throughout the Salto valley. \n\nFigure 7.71 show the cross section, plus some groundwater resistivity values and levels, \n\ntogether with interpreted lithology. \n\n \n\nFigure 7.69 \u2013 Salto valley TEM 1D sounding mean models near the existing boreholes. \n\n \n\nFigure 7.70 \u2013 Boreholes lithologic description at mid Salto valley (INGRH data). \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n__________________________________ \n\n 206\n\nFigure 7.71 \u2013 Resistivity cross section at Salto valley, from 1D TEM sounding models, \n\nGroundwater level and resistivity (ohm.m) plus interpreted geology.  \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n__________________________________ \n\n 207\n\nFrom the groundwater samples, a seawater influence is plausible, as lowest resistivity values \n\nare nearest to the ocean ones, increasing upstream. At middle profile, the shallow layers are \n\nmore resistive (50 to 100 ohm.m), most certainly due to dry pillow lavas. At the end of the \n\nprofile the resistivity is somewhat low (10 ohm.m). This might be due to the high porosity of \n\ntuff and fractured basalts. \n\n \n\n \n\n7.1.4.2 \u2013 Salto 2D data inversion \n \n\nTEM soundings at Salto valley were acquired on a straight line. In this conditions the spatially \n\nconstrained algorithm methodology becomes a 1D inversion with laterally constrains (LCI). \n\nThe overall mean distance between soundings was 155 m. The modelling inversion tests had \n\nbeen carried as previously, changing initial damping factor, the number of layers and \n\ndifferent EDC values. \n\n \n\nThe maximum iteration was set to 60, and the rms value to 0.02. Initial model was always set \n\nto a homogeneous resistivity medium of 10 ohm.m, with 15 layers (until 80 m deep). Figure \n\n7.72 displays the mean rms misfit to maximum iteration number and number of soundings in \n\nthe EDC. Misfit error is high with no lateral models influence and drop with LCI influence to a \n\nmean value of 1.2%, with almost equal results and iteration. The number of soundings within \n\nEDC grows up almost linearly because soundings are evenly spaced. In this particular case, \n\nthe number of pair of soundings pairs seem not to have too much influence in individual \n\nmodels. \n\n \n\nFigure 7.72 \u2013 Mean rms quasi-2D models misfit and iteration number (blue square), and cumulative \n\nsounding pair number (red square) for several constrained distances at Salto valley. \n\nInitial damping factor set to 1.0 and 15 layers with 10 ohm.m model space. \n\n \n\nSome of the 1D models and corresponding soundings\u2019 data fits are shown on next page, in \n\nfigures 7.73 and 7.74, (mid-range EDC value of 450 m).

The FT 5 borehole is located 4 km inland. Fractured basalt followed by more \n\ncompact basalt with some tuff layers are the mean matrix. At mid valley and near the \n\nshoreline, a few meters thin alluvium layer exist. \n\n \n\nMost of the soundings exhibit a resistivity change at about 20 m depth from a higher value to \n\nnear 10 ohm.m, approximately at the aquifer know depth. A thin conductive layer is also \n\ndetected in most of the inland soundings, most certainly of clay origin. This layer can act as \n\nan impermeable horizontal barrier, if extended laterally and thus confining the aquifer locally. \n\nBelow the 10 ohm.m aquifer layer, a deeper and less resistive layer takes place. As the \n\nmeasured groundwater level is some 5 m to 10 m below the surface at the start and end \n\nTEM profile (corresponding to a 0.014 hydraulic gradient), respectively, those layer\u2019s \n\ninterfaces cannot be linked to groundwater table and to deep fresh-seawater interface.

Regarding to \n\ngroundwater EC, the number of samples (mainly from wells) is such that allows a \n\ngroundwater electric resistivity map at the region. Most of the data comes from locations at \n\nthe axis of both valleys. A rather extensive data was pull together at summer 2000. \n\nSignificant EC changes are not observed in the course of the years at inland regions far from \n\nthe shoreline. But, nearest the ocean, some important changes are known, as shown in \n\nfigure 7.92 below. Some groundwater EC measured at wells in 2005 has been compared \n\nwith previous ones, from year 2000. It\u2019s clear a relationship between EC and the distance to \n\nthe coastline. This behaviour is not just exclusive at Seca valley it seems to happen also at \n\nmost of the farmed valleys of Santiago. \n\n \n\nFigure 7.92 \u2013 Groundwater EC (25 \u00b0C) increase versus sea distance, between 2000 to 2005 years, \n\nat Seca valley (from INGRH data). \n\n \n\nFigure 7.93 presents the condition in year 2000, before the electromagnetic field work (at the \n\nyear 2005). It is clear the remarkable relation between the groundwater resistivity data and \n\npoints\u2019 distance to the coastline.  \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n__________________________________ \n\n 223\n\nTaking into account the bulk resistivity values at aquifer depth (from TEM inversions) and the \n\ncorresponding in-situ groundwater resistivity values, it is possible to calculate the formation \n\nfactor (F) by expression (5.5). The table 7.2 below, exhibit such as results. \n\nFigure 7.93 \u2013 Krigged groundwater resistivity map from manmade well and borehole data points, at \n\nSeca and Picos valleys (year 2000), (from INGRH data). \n\n \n\nTable 7.2 \u2013 Formation factor values at Seca and Picos valleys. \n\nSeca \n\nTEM # \n\nResistivity / ohm.m \nF \n\nPicos \n\nTEM # \n\nResistivity / ohm.m \nF \n\nbulk water bulk water \n\n15 1.5 0.4 3.5 9 1.2 0.5 2.6 \n16 2.1 0.5 4.2 10 1.9 0.7 2.9 \n17 2.7 0.6 4.5 11 1.9 0.9 2.0 \n18 3.9 0.7 5.7 12 4.4 1.2 3.6 \n19 2.6 0.7 3.6 1 21.7 3.1 6.2 \n20 2.7 0.8 3.3 2 19.2 4.8 2.7 \n10 4.9 0.9 5.3 3 12.8 5.6 3.4 \n11 5.0 0.9 5.5 4 19.1 6.3 1.8 \n1 5.3 1.3 4.2 5 11.5 6.7 1.4 \n8 6.1 1.3 4.8 6 9.2 7.3 1.2 \n9 12.1 2.7 4.4 7 8.7 9.5 1.5 \n7 13.4 3.5 3.9 8 14.6 0.5 2.6 \n2 11.9 5.5 2.1 - - - - \n5 20.8 8.3 2.5 - - - - \n\nMean value 4.1 Mean value 2.7 \n\nStandard Deviation 1.1 Standard Deviation 1.4 \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n__________________________________ \n\n 224\n\nDoing a simple analysis of the calculated F values its worth remarking that all of them are \n\nrather small, with a mean value of 4.1 and 2.7, respectively to Seca and Picos. Apparently, \n\nthere aren\u2019t significant differences between F values at the beginning of the profile, near the \n\ncoastline were alluvium is thicker, and the end of the profile, where the alluvium is much \n\nthinner, replaced by fractured basalt. Nevertheless, seems that formation factor values are \n\ndecreasing from the shoreline, upwards the valleys, figure 7.94. \n\nFigure 7.94 \u2013 Formation factor versus sea distance, for Seca and Picos valleys. \n\n \n\nThese values can be directly translated into porosities via Archie first law (5.11b). Table 7.3 \n\nsummarizes this calculation with three sets of parameter\u2019s values (a and m), typical for \n\nalluvium (higher values) and fractured basalts (lower values) environments. These porosities \n\nseem rather high, especially at the lowest formation factor values, but are within the range of \n\nvalues published for this sort of lithology. \n\n \n\nTable 7.3 \u2013 Mean porosities from formation factor values, at Seca and Picos valleys. \n\nValley F a = 0.6 , m = 1 a = 1 , m = 1 a = 1 , m = 1.4 \n\nSeca 4.1 0.15 0.24 0.37 \n\nPicos 2.7 0.22 0.37 0.49 \n\n \n\nSeveral factors may affect the values of the formation factor. The clay content dispersion \n\nthroughout alluvium, and throughout fractured basalts, and its cation exchange capacity \n\n(CEC). Or to a much lesser extent, a low bulk resistivity value due to the equivalence \n\nproblems in the inversion process. Thin clay layers and clayed inclusions are reported in the \n\nalluvium and also in basaltic formations. Concerning the clay surface conductivity influence, \n\nthe analyses of the bulk resistivity versus groundwater EC available data seems to indicate a \n\nreal effect (figure 7.95), which will produce always a major correction at the lower \n\ngroundwater EC places. At Picos the data fit is worse because it shows high data scattering \n\nat low conductivities. The surface conduction term (?\n) has been estimated from the \n\nextrapolated intercept when groundwater EC is set to zero (Waxman and Smits, 1968), using \n\na power fit function (see figure 7.95). \n  \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n__________________________________ \n\n 225\n\nApplying Archie\u2019s second law (5.12), with the mean calculated correction, ?S = 592 \u00b5S.cm\n-1\n \n\nto Seca valley and ?S = 653 \u00b5S.cm\n-1\n to Picos valley the mean porosity values became \n\n(excluding the highest bulk resistivities ones) as following (table 7.4): \n\nFigure 7.95 \u2013 Bulk versus groundwater EC relation, (continuous line - fit function, dotted lines - plus \n\nand less one standard deviation fit function), for Seca and Picos valleys. \n\n \n\nTable 7.4 \u2013 Mean porosities from corrected formation factor values, at Seca and Picos valleys. \n\nValley F a = 0.6 , m = 1 a = 1 , m = 1 a = 1 , m = 1.4 \n\nSeca 7.7 \u00b1 1.7 0.08 \u00b1 0.02 0.13 \u00b1 0.03 0.23 \u00b1 0.05 \n\nPicos 5.4 \u00b1 2.2 0.11 \u00b1 0.07 0.19 \u00b1 0.10 0.30 \u00b1 0.12 \n\n \n\nThis is assuming an effective porosity (connected porosity structure) equal to the porosity \n\ngiven by Archie\u2019s law. These ranges of porosity values can be compared against the \n\navailable transmissivities values from pumping tests at boreholes FT-63 and FBE-169 \n\n(inland, near last TEM Seca sounding), which have both about 60 m\n2\nd\n\n-1\n. At thick alluvium \n\nformation, the transmissivities values are usually higher in one order, 600 m\n2\nd\n\n-1\n (Gomes, \n\n2007). With the assumption of a 40 m thick aquifer system, the hydraulic permeability \n\nbecomes respectively 3\u00d710\n-12\n\n m\n2\n and 3\u00d710\n\n-11\n m\n\n2\n, (and K = 1.5 and 15 m.d\n\n-1\n, to a confined \n\naquifer hypothesis).  \n\n \n\nPorosity can be estimated taking the K-C relation for the sedimentary environment \n\n(expression (5.7b)), and the expression (5.6) for the fractured basalt environmental \n\n(assuming that it acts identically to granular porosity when it is densely fractured) with an \n\nequivalent grain diameter at least as 8 times the inner fractured radius channels. The results \n\nare given in table 7.5. The lithologic description of the alluvium sedimentary formation has no \n\nreference to be coarse sandy, so the porosity must be in 15 to 25% range with a mean grain \n\nparticle diameter below 0.3 mm (equivalent to medium to fine sand). Sediments in Picos \n\nvalley have higher porosity and fine grained materials than sediments in Seca valley. \n\nFractures at the basaltic formations seem to exist below the 0.15 mm equivalent D50 value \n\n(10 \u00b5m inner radius), with porosities in the 10% (in Seca) to 20% (in Picos) range. That inner \n\nradius fractures give a specific surface area (Sp, known as SSA) around 0.1 m\n2\ng\n\n-1\n, a common \n\nvalue at basaltic formations (Nielsen and Fisk, 2008). \n  \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n__________________________________ \n\n 226\n\nTable 7.5 \u2013 D50 grain size (alluvium) and equivalent D50 grain size \n\n(fractured basalt) in mm, to given porosities.

From the W-S models \n\nand their relations (chapter 5, expressions 5.13 to 5.15) assuming a specific weight (density) \n\nof 2500 kg.m\n-3\n and cementation index of 1.0, the mean CEC estimated value is: 1.7 \n\nmeq\n+\n/100 g to 15% porosity for Seca valley and 2.5 meq\n\n+\n/100 g to 20% porosity for Picos \n\nvalley. These are low CEC values but nevertheless, affecting bulk resistivity values. As there \n\nis an intrinsic relationship between CEC and porosity, none of them having independent \n\nmeasures, only a rough idea on the spatial distribution of CEC can be made (figures 7.96 \n\nand 7.97). \n\nFigure 7.96 \u2013 Porosity values (CEC = 1.7 meq\n+\n/100 g) and CEC values (porosity = 15%) \n\nversus sea distance at Seca valley. \n\nFigure 7.97 \u2013 Porosity values (CEC = 2.5 meq\n+\n/100 g) and CEC values (porosity = 20%) \n\nversus sea distance at Picos valley.  \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n__________________________________ \n\n 227\n\n \n\n \n\n7.2.2 \u2013 Salto, Flamengos, and S.

Although the density \n\nof points per stream valley is much smaller, it allows the plotting of a groundwater electric \n\nresistivity map for the entire region. Figure 7.98 presents the condition at summer of 2000. \n\nAgain, it is clear the remarkable relation between groundwater resistivity and sea distance. \n\nFigure 7.98 \u2013 Krigged groundwater resistivity map from manmade well and borehole data points, \n\nat Salto, Flamengos and S.

The formation factors \n\nare again very low (near 3.0), exception of a few values at Flamengos valley. Conversion to \n\nporosities, by Archie first law, will give high to very high porosity values, as seen below in \n\ntable 7.7.

Both have \n\nlow values at the 2 to 5 m\n2\nd\n\n-1\n range, which is typical for the Flamengos formation lithology \n\n(Gomes, 2007). Near the coastline, where the alluvium formations are thicker, the \n\ntransmissivities are again much higher, around the 600 m\n2\nd\n\n-1\n. With the assumption of a 40 m \n\nthick aquifer system, the hydraulic permeability becomes 2\u00d710\n-13\n\n m\n2\n and 3\u00d710\n\n-11\n m\n\n2\n, (and  \n\nK = 0.1 and 15 m.d\n-1\n, to a confined aquifer hypothesis), respectively. \n\n \n\nThe corresponding mean grain diameter of alluvium formation and equivalent grain diameter \n\nfor fractured basaltic formation are given at table 7.8. At the alluvium sedimentary formation, \n\nporosity must be in the 20 to 30% range with particle mean size around 0.2 mm (equivalent \n\nto fine sand). Porosity seems to grow from Salto (at south) to S. Miguel, but this could be \n\nbiased with this so little data amount. Fractures at basaltic formations seem to exist below \n\nthe 0.06 mm equivalent D50 value (2 \u00b5m inner radius), with porosities in the 10 to 20% range, \n\nwith Salto valley in the former limit and S. Miguel valley in the later limit. This fractures inner \n\nradius gives a SSA value around 0.3 m\n2\ng\n\n-1\n. \n\n \n\nTable 7.8 \u2013 D50 grain size (alluvium) and equivalent D50 grain size \n\n(fractured basalt) in mm, to given porosities, Salto, Flamengos and S.

For this seawater conductivity, the calculated salinity is around S = 37.2, i.e. \n\na TDS content of 37200 mg.L\n-1\n (Kennish, M., 1989). This seawater 0.18 ohm.m electric \n\nresistivity value is compared with TEM soundings carried out near to sea, where apparent \n\nresistivities show deeper seawater influence other than just the shallower one. This would be \n\nalways the best procedure to get better porosity results (Kafri, Goldman, 2005). At Salto the \n\ncorrected and uncorrected formation factors are 9.4 and 8.4, respectively for first sounding. \n\nAt Flamengos they are respectively, 12.0 and 10.3, and at S. Miguel the calculated values \n\nare 6.5 and 6.0, respectively. All these values are higher than those calculated and \n\ndiscussed above, by some 50% at Salto and S. Miguel. At Flamengos, the offset value is \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n__________________________________ \n\n 230\n\neven higher. Explanation to this could be that water is not \u201cpure seawater\u201d, but a rather very \n\nhigh saline mixture. Nevertheless, this implies that former mean formation factors must be \n\ntaken at higher limit and that porosities are consequently small, and must be at the low limit \n\nas well. Table 7.9 below, summarize these values. Porosities at fractured basalts (including \n\ntuffs) must be considered with a mean value around 10 to 15%. \n\n \n\nTable 7.9 \u2013 Mean porosities from seawater corrected formation factor values, \n\nat Salto, Flamengos and S.

Domingos\u2019s valley, the numbers of manmade wells are even smaller. The few ones \n\nnear the sea are dry from time to time. The only available groundwater EC measures at mid \n\nvalley come from a few boreholes there, together with their lithologic description. Borehole \n\nFT-40 is at mid valley between TEM soundings 26 and 27, with a measured groundwater EC \n\nof 1375 \u00b5S.cm\n-1\n. From year 2003 to 2006 FT-40 EC values had only 25 \u00b5S.cm\n\n-1\n variations. \n\nThe modelled bulk resistivity values at aquifer depth from TEM 26 and 27 soundings are 12.2 \n\nand 11.6 ohm.m, respectively.

This must represent a fresh to seawater mixture as \n\ngroundwater level is barely above the sea level at all this near sea area. \n\n \n\nFigure 7.101 \u2013 Groundwater resistivity versus distance to the sea, \n\nat Tarrafal and Ribeira Grande valley. \n\n \n\nDirect comparison between these water values and TEM modelled bulk resistivity gives a \n\nformation factor of F = 9.2 \u00b1 2.8 (without any clay superficial conductivity correction) for the \n\nshallow fractured basalt.

On this assumption, with a \n\n0.18 ohm.m seawater resistivity value, the formation factor is calculated to this deep level, \n\nfrom the TEM bulk resistivity values.

Figure 7.102 shows the corresponding formation factor map. With these resistivity \n\nvalues, any correction by clay superficial conductivity adds at most some more 10 to 20%. \n\n \n\nFigure 7.102 \u2013 Formation factor map at Tarrafal and Ribeira Grande valley, 30 m below sea level. \n\n \n\nIt is evident, as previous quasi-3D models showed (figure 7.61), a NE-SW oriented feature at \n\nsouth Ch\u00e3o Bom area. This must be certainly related to the lithologic variation described \n\nbetween SST-33 and SST-34 boreholes (figure 7.53), from deep alluvium layers (at south) to \n\nfractured basaltic and pyroclastic formations (at north). \n\n \n\nThe known transmissivity value at FT-29 is high, around 7000 m\n2\nd\n\n-1\n (fractured basalts). That \n\nmeans also a very high value of 2\u00d710\n-10\n\n m\n2\n for hydraulic permeability, with 40 m thick aquifer \n\nsystem assumption (and K = 175 m.d\n-1\n, to a confined aquifer hypothesis). The analogous \n\nequivalent grain diameter for this fractured basaltic formation is around 0.5 mm, with fracture \n\ninternal radius of 50 \u00b5m. This gives a porosity range between 15 to 30% and a SSA around \n\n0.01 m\n2\ng\n\n-1\n. If this transmissivity value is over estimated, porosities are necessarily lower. \n\nNevertheless, the high formation factor area at north Ch\u00e3o Bom is probably a low porosity \n\nzone (below 10 to 15%) and the orientated feature a higher porosity one (above 25 to 30%). \n\n \n  \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n_________________________________ \n\n 234\n\n \n\n7.2.5 \u2013 Hydrologic parameters \n \n\nThe groundwater recharge rates for each valley were calculated knowing the basin spatial \n\ndevelopment at each bioclimatic zone and annual mean precipitation rate and recharges \n\npercentages (subchapter 6.4.1.).

Half of this \n\ngroundwater exploitation goes to agriculture land irrigation, which implies a partial water \n\nreturn of 10 to 20% to the soil.

Explanation for these differences can be ascribed \n\nto a changing scale factor of the hydraulic transmissivity between local and regional flow path \n\nbehavior and to variable lithologic conditions at both local and regional (or borehole and \n\nbasin) scales. The mean recharge rates can be overestimated, as detailed spatial \n\nparameter\u2019s description trough time is not complete and major changes are detected \n\nbetween the basins on the same year. Also, the deeper groundwater discharge may include \n\na substantial fraction of submarine groundwater discharge, directly into the ocean. \n  \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n_________________________________ \n\n 235\n\n \n\n7.3 \u2013 TEM versus Hydrochemical data \n \n\nSeveral chemical analyses have been done from water samples collected at natural springs, \n\nwells and boreholes. The most important water elements and compounds were measured to \n\nassign water type and saturation conditions. Comparison to bulk modelled resistivity from \n\nTEM data is now analysed and relations between both data sets are sought after. \n\n \n\n \n\n7.3.1 \u2013 Groundwater salt origins \n \n\nThe global chemical characteristic of the groundwater at Santiago Island was already \n\npresented in chapter 6. Geochemical data sub-set matching the worked valleys (and several \n\nothers near the sea) show a predominant NaCl water facies. The source of this groundwater \n\ntype and measured salinity could arise from seawater encroachment inland or by a different \n\nprocess or source mechanism. These later ones could comprise entrapped ancient (fossil) \n\nseawater, physic-chemical evaporate rock dissolution, sea-spray accumulation over time, \n\ndisplacement of ancient saline groundwater from adjacent aquifer or aquitard by thermal \n\nconvection or natural advection, aquitards leaking through existing faults and lately by human \n\nrelated activities (pollution) from sewage effluents and agriculture practices and return flows. \n\nAll these can contribute to groundwater salt increase, (Custodio, 1997). \n\n \n\nThe natural and starting point should be the direct comparison to local seawater composition \n\n(figure 7.103). Seawater exhibit in general a uniform chemical composition over time, with \n\nmarked features like the predominance of Cl\n-\n and Na\n\n+\n (with molar Na/Cl = 0.86), an excess \n\nof chloride over the alkali ions (Na and K) and also Mg\n2+\n\n greatly in excess over Ca\n2+\n\n (about \n\nfour to five times). Further solute differentiation between ground- and seawater can be done, \n\nwith the latter one having Mg > HCO3 + SO4. The ground meteoric waters (even with marine \n\nsalt\u2019s re-solution), have Na > Cl. These waters can carry significant Ca, in excess over HCO3 \n\n+ SO4 due to diagenetic carbonate or silicate reactions, (Jones et al., 1999). \n\n \n\nFigure 7.103 \u2013 Stiffer diagram of seawater mean major chemical specimens, around Santiago Island. \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n_________________________________ \n\n 236\n\n \n\n7.3.2 \u2013 Criteria to distinguish saltwater intrusions \n \n\nAs the groundwater salinity can have different sources, the distinction of these different \n\nsalinization mechanisms is crucial to apply a correct water-resource management program, \n\nwith discrimination between modern seawater intrusion and relics of entrapped brines within \n\nor underlying aquifers. The interpretation of the salinization process should be based upon \n\ngeological and hydrochemical criteria and data (chemical e isotopic). Several geochemical \n\ncriteria had been suggested to identify the origin of salinity, especially the detection of \n\nseawater intrusion in opposition to other salinity sources in coastal aquifers, (Jones et al., \n\n1999), and should be used altogether to clearly delineate the situation. \n\n \n\n \n\nSalinity values \u2013 because of the contrast between marine and typical continental anion \n\nmatrices, the clearest indication of a possible seawater intrusion is the increase of Chloride \n\nconcentration as a proxy for salinity (although other processes may lead to a similar \n\nphenomenon). In coastal aquifers, where continuous overexploitation can cause a reduction \n\nof the piezometric level, the intrusion of seawater results in a salinity breakthrough. Thus, \n\ntime-series of chloride concentrations (e.g. at seashore boreholes) can record the early \n\nevolution of a relatively rapid salinization process. \n\n \n\nBr/Cl ratio \u2013 the Bromide to Chloride ratio can be used as a reliable tracer, because both Cl \n\nand Br usually behave conservatively (i.e., do not react with the aquifer solid matrix) except \n\nin the presence of very high amounts of organic matter (Davis et al., 1998). Seawater (Br/Cl \n\nmolar ratio of 0.0015) is distinguished from relics of evaporated seawater (hypersaline brines \n\nBr/Cr > 0.0015, Dead Sea = 0.011 (Starinsky et al., 1983)), evaporite-dissolution products \n\n(below 0.00045) and anthropogenic sources like sewage effluents (Br/Cl above 0.00055) \n\n(Vengosh and Pankratov, 1998) or agriculture-return flows (high Br/Cl ratios). (The global \n\nanalyses of groundwater Br/Cl ratio in Santiago had been written at chapter 6). \n\n \n\nNa/Cl ratio \u2013 the Na/Cl ratio of saltwater intrusion are usually lower than the marine values \n\n(i.e., bellow molar ratio of 0.86). Thus low Na/Cl ratio, combined with other geochemical \n\nparameters, can be an indicator of the arrival of saltwater intrusion, even at relatively low \n\nChloride concentrations during the first early stages of salinization. The low Na/Cl ratio of \n\nseawater intrusion is distinguishable from the high Na/Cl ratio (above unit), typical of \n\nanthropogenic sources, like domestic waste waters. (The global analyses of groundwater \n\nNa/Cl ratio in Santiago was also written at chapter 6). \n\n \n\nCa/Mg, Ca/(HCO3 + SO4) ratios \u2013 as already mention, one of the most conspicuous features \n\nof seawater intrusion is the enrichment of Ca over its concentration in seawater. High Ca/Mg \n\nand Ca/(HCO3 + SO4) ratios (>1) are further indicators of arrival of seawater intrusion. It \n\nworth mention, however, that saline water with high Ca can be originated by a different \n\nmechanism, not necessarily related to base-exchange reaction and modification of modern \n\nseawater. \n  \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n_________________________________ \n\n 237\n\nO and H isotopes \u2013 linear correlations are expected from mixing of seawater with \n18\n\nO \n\ndepleted groundwater in the correlation of ?\n2\nH versus ?\n\n18\nO or Cl versus ?\n\n18\nO. Different \n\nsources with high salinity (e.g., agriculture return-flows, sewage effluents) would result in \n\ndifferent slopes due to evaporation processes that would change the isotopic composition of \n\nthe saline end-member. (The global analyses of O and H isotopes in Santiago, was also \n\nwritten at chapter 6). \n\n \n\nBoron isotopes \u2013 The Boron isotopic composition of groundwater can be a powerful tool for \n\ndiscrimination of salinization sources, in particular, distinguishing seawater from \n\nanthropogenic fluid such as domestic waste water. The ?\n11\n\nB values of saltwater intrusion \n\nrange over 30\u2030 to the seawater value (?\n11\n\nB = 39\u2030), reflecting mixing of freshwater and \n\nseawater in coastal areas. \n\n \n\n7.3.3 \u2013 Groundwater chemical modification \n \n\nAs the chemical composition of a coastal salty groundwater can deviate significantly from just \n\na simple conservative seawater-freshwater mixing (Appelo and Geirnart, 1991) the criteria \n\nmentioned above should be used with care, when looking for groundwater salt origin. Most of \n\nthis deviation can be ascribed to water-rock interactions (Appelo and Postma, 1993), with the \n\nprincipal one being ion exchange with clay materials (Appelo and Willemsen, 1987) and also \n\ncarbonate dissolution-precipitation processes (Fidelibus and Tulipano, 1986). When the \n\nconcern chemical parameters behave conservatively, they can be used to estimate the \n\ndifferent source contributions, therefore, the use of Cl, Br and Deuterium. Otherwise they can \n\ncarry information on the solid matrix extended interaction (e.g. B and Sr isotopes), (Morell et \n\nal., 1996). The four basic reactions associated with the hydrogeologic environmental setups \n\nof seawater intrusion are; the water mixing, and that includes evaporites associated fluids, \n\ncarbonate precipitation and dolomitization, ion exchange and silicate (clay) diagenesis, and \n\nredox reactions, (Jones et al., 1999). \n\n \n\nMixing \u2013 when freshwater and seawater mixing occur, a small amount of this latter is \n\nsufficient to overcome and dominate groundwater chemical composition. A 5% seawater \n\ncontribution outputs groundwater salinity with more than 1 g Cl.l\n-1\n. As a result, Chloride is \n\nused as a very sensitive mixing indicator and also the ionic Na/Cl ratio of seawater will \n\ndominate its chemical composition (assuming conservative behaviour). Stables O and H \n\nisotopes are also used to ascribe the mixing amount, as freshwater is in general depleted in \n\nboth \n18\n\nO and \n2\nH relative to seawater (Manzano et al., 1990 and Izbicki, 1996). \n\n \n\nExchange reactions in water-rock interaction \u2013 cation exchange in seawater intrusion \n\nplays a key role, and has been treated and detailed by Appelo and Postma (1993). The \n\nfreshwater is usually dominated by Ca\n2+\n\n and HCO3\n-\n ions (mostly from calcite dissolution). \n\nTherefore, the cation exchangers in aquifers such as clay minerals, organic matter or fine \n\ngrain rock materials, have mostly Ca\n2+\n\n absorbed at their surfaces. In contrast to this, the \n\nsediments in contact with seawater have Na\n+\n as the most prevalent absorbed cation (Sayles \n\nand Mangelsdorf, 1977). When seawater intrudes on a coastal freshwater aquifer, ion Na\n+\n \n\nreplaces part of the Ca\n2+\n\n ion at the solid surface. In such reaction, Na\n+\n is taken up by the \n\nsolid phase, and Ca\n2+\n\n is released and the solute composition changes from NaCI to CaCl2 \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n_________________________________ \n\n 238\n\nfacies (Custodio, 1987, Appelo and Postma, 1993). Moreover, as the Chloride ion \n\nconcentration remains unaffected by this trade reaction, it can be regarded as a reference \n\nparameter, as mention before. Consequently, as seawater intrudes on coastal aquifers \n\ncontaining freshwater, the Na/Cl ratio decreases and the (Ca + Mg)/Cl ratio increases. Under \n\nsuch conditions, the enrichments in Calcium and Magnesium should be balanced by the \n\ndepletion of Sodium. Accordingly, the decrease in Na/Cl ratio balances the increase in (Ca + \n\nMg)/CI ratio (Custodio, 1987). Upon inflow of freshwater the reverse process takes place, \n\nwith the increase of the Na/Cl ratio and a decrease of the (Ca + Mg)/CI ratio value, and \n\nformation of NaHCO3 fluid facies. In addition to the expected development of a CaCl2 water \n\ntype at the seawater front, a significant increase in Mg\n2+\n\n also takes place. These increased \n\nlevels are congruent at first, but when the Ca from exchange runs out, the trends of the two \n\nion concentrations diverge afterwards - the Ca\n2+\n\n decreases and Mg\n2+\n\n increases towards its \n\nhigher concentration value in seawater. In fact, because of the relatively small amount of \n\nexchanged Ca compared to even the relatively low Ca level maintained by CaCO3 saturation \n\nof the saline water, the decrease of Ca content as already begun before the Chloride \n\nreaches the seawater concentrations (Appelo and Postma, 1993). \n\n \n\nIt is also known that when seawater intrusion into groundwater is primarily by diffusion rather \n\nthan advection, and the cation exchange capacity of the sediment are low, the effects of ion \n\nexchange tend to be considerably reduced, and the resulting water compositions will \n\nresemble a simple mixture of fresh and saline water (Appelo and Postma, 1993). \n\n \n\nCarbonate Diagenesis and Dolomitization \u2013 Plummer (1975) and Wigley and Plummer \n\n(1976) have shown the effects of speciation in the mixing of dilute carbonate groundwater \n\nwith seawater when coastal aquifers are composed of some carbonate materials, either of \n\ncalcareous clastics or of limestone. The mixing of dilute groundwater in equilibrium with \n\ncalcite with common seawater that is supersaturated with respect to calcite can produce \n\nsolutions of intermediate composition that are undersaturated with respect to calcite. Besides \n\nthis, products in the mixture might be undersaturated with respect to calcite but \n\nsupersaturated with respect to dolomite, as several authors have shown (Jones et al., 1999 \n\nand references thereafter). The extent of this calcite undersaturation and dolomite \n\nsupersaturation, is strongly dependent on temperature and also heavily dependent on the \n\nsolubility of dolomite, which is stronger for very finned grain forms. The dolomitization \n\nprocess, in which calcite and dolomite are in equilibrium results in a progressive enrichment \n\nof Ca over Mg in solution (i.e., Ca/Mg ratio increases). Therefore, saline water affected by \n\ndolomitization processes should be characterized by high Ca content and by a CaCl \n\nsignature (i.e., Ca/(HCO3 + SO4) > 1) (Starinsky et al., 1983; Carpenter, 1978). The formation \n\nof dolomite in modern marine sediments and sediment burial to shallow depths is strongly \n\ncontrolled by the reaction kinetic that is slow even at high supersaturation, (Morse and \n\nMackenzie, 1990). \n\n \n\nAdsorption and organic matter reduction \u2013 One of the processes that modifies the \n\nseawater intrusion chemistry is adsorption onto clay minerals in the host aquifer. The \n\nelements that are sensitive to adsorption process are Potassium, Boron and Lithium. The \n\nadsorption process resulted in low K/Cl, B/Cl and Li/Cl ratios in the residual saline \n\ngroundwater relative to the marine ratios (of K/Cl = 0.02 at seawater).  \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n_________________________________ \n\n 239\n\nThe seawater encroachment and the formation of a relatively static interface zone between \n\noverlying fresh and underlying saline water, may produce local low redox conditions, due to \n\nthe decomposition of dissolved organic matter, of organic-rich sediment or fine suspended \n\norganic particulate, as mention by Schoeller (1956), Custodio and Liamas (1976), Hem \n\n(1985). According to Custodio et al., (1987), this process will cause changes in pH, and the \n\nreduction of dissolved sulfate to H2S, resulting in low SO4/Cl ratio. These changes shift the \n\ncalcium carbonate equilibria and most commonly cause dissolution. The resulting increase in \n\nthe Calcium content is frequentiy masked by exchange of Ca\n2+\n\n for Mg\n2+\n\n or Na\n+\n on clays \n\npreviously equilibrated with more seawater like cation matrices. Intense and episodic nature \n\nof rainfall, lack of soil cover, well developed fractures and fissures and shallow depth of the \n\nvadose zone, all contribute to significant inputs of organic matter to the freshwater lens, \n\nWhitaker and Smart (2007). This generates potential for dissolution considerably greater \n\nthan that predicted solely by simulations of inorganic mixing between basal freshwater lens \n\nwaters and underlying saline groundwaters. \n\n \n\nFossil Seawater intrusion \u2013 in the coastal areas, if entrapped fossil seawater exists at \n\nunflushed parts of the aquifer, they can also affect the quality of adjacent fresh groundwater. \n\nFossil seawater could have originated from past invasions of coastal aquifers accompanying \n\nthe sea level rises. However, it has been difficult do date this saline groundwater and to \n\nevaluate the timing and time rate of seawater intrusion. The evidence for ancient seawater is \n\nprimarily from tritium and radiocarbon dating, as ascribed at chapter 6. The \nl4\nC content of \n\nfresh and saline groundwater is a result of complex contributions from different sources, \n\nincluding the original seawater, soil CO2, carbon derived from dissolution of the carbonate \n\nmatrix, and carbon derived from decomposition of organic matter. But the \n14\n\nC budget can be \n\naffected by the processes occurring in seawater encroachment. These include interaction of \n\ninterstitial water with bottom sea sediments and with the aquifer matrix. Consequently, \n14\n\nC \n\ninterpretation requires additional chemical and \n13\n\nC supporting data. Another indirect \n\nevaluation of the age of saline groundwater is ?\n18\n\nO value of saline water. Groundwater with \n\ndepleted \n18\n\nO lower than that of modern atmospheric recharge reflects past replenishment \n\nwhen the ?\n18\n\nO of precipitation was lower. Also, groundwater dissolved noble gases (He, Ne, \n\nAr, Kr and Xe) analyses can be applied to support and adds constraints to the radiocarbon \n\ndata (Aeschbach?Hertig et al., 1999). \n \n\n \n\n7.3.4 \u2013 Hydrochemical data at S. Domingos valley \n \n\nAt S. Domingos valley, groundwater chemical data have been taken from two boreholes; the \n\nFT-40 and the FT-42, at two epochs, before (June) and after (December) the traditional rain \n\nseason. Table 7.15 includes some values and ratios related to water quality. Borehole FT-40 \n\nis located at mid TEM profile and FT-42 past last inland TEM sounding. Both have NaCl \n\nwater types (figures 7.104 to 7.106). The measured EC, TDS, pH and Chloride are almost \n\nidentical (exception for a major Cl decrease at FT-42). Both groundwaters are \n\nundersaturated relative to Calcite and Aragonite. The TDS and Chloride amounts are above \n\nthe freshwater threshold limit of 0.5 g.L\n-1\n. These values are not directly related to present \n\ntime seawater intrusion, according to several ratios values. Those high values can have two \n\ndifferent origins:: can be linked to some upwelling of trapped ancient seawater (by a diffusion \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n_________________________________ \n\n 240\n\nprocess or due to the overexploitation) and mixing into the shallow groundwater, by natural \n\ndischarge from mainland, or by sewage effluents and agriculture activities, as Nitrate values \n\nare high and the pH decrease can be from organic matter origin. The measured variations \n\nagree with the shallow waters flush in the rainy season. The answer is that most certainly \n\nboth situations are taking place at those places as TEM resistivity models had shown, a \n\ndeeper high conductive layer exists and also because villages are placed around and above \n\nthe valley. The intense overexploitation as a mean to explain the increasing salinization by \n\nmixing is taken as a hypothesis by Carreira et al. (2010), as a result of geochemical and \n\nisotopic analysis study of 36 inland groundwater samples. That includes also the Tritium \n\ncontent at FT-40 water, which is null and point to a higher residence time. \n\n \n\nTable 7.15 \u2013 S.

All are undersaturated of Calcite \n\nand Aragonite. The measured TDS values are slightly above 0.5 g.L\n-1\n. The majority of Na/Cl \n\nratios are near the unit value and the ratios with Ca are low. That means that the salinity is \n\nnot related to present time seawater intrusion whatsoever. The mechanism is similar to that \n\none found in S. Domingos valley, but to a lesser extent.

Nevertheless, the Magnesium by Calcium ions trade can be also \n\nmasking the water mixing from deep conductive salty layer. \n\n \n\nTable 7.16 \u2013 Seca valley hydrochemical borehole data, (UnS - UnderSaturated). \n\nParameter \nFT-9 FT-63 FBE-169 \n\nJun.

Water facies is different; the water at \n\nSP-34 is of NaCl type while the other two are of Na-, Mg- or Ca-HCO3 types, (figures 7.111 \n\nto 7.113). In all of them, TDS values exceed the limit of 0.5 g.L\n-1\n. SP-39 groundwater is of \n\nNaHCO3 type and supersaturated of Calcite and approximately saturated of Aragonite. \n\nAlthough being the nearest to shoreline, it is outside the valley, and its salinization comes \n\nfrom a water-rock interaction process.

All samples have TDS values above the 0.5 g.L\n-1\n threshold. At the well, the ratios \n\nindicate a fresh-seawater mixing with Na exchange. Saturation of CaCO3 is high before rain \n\nseason, however, all ratios and values are in accordance with the freshwater rainy flush, \n\nafter rain season. A dolomitization process seems to happen also. The water salinity is \n\nrelated to a water-rock interaction with agriculture activity\u2019s inputs, and it\u2019s not to exclude a \n\ndeep salty layer influence too. It is very similar to S.

Grande valley \n \n\nAt Tarrafal and Ribeira Grande valley, five hydrochemical analysis exists; three boreholes \n\nand two wells. These later ones are located at Ch\u00e3o Bom (Tarrafal) near the sea. Waters \n\nfrom these wells together with the borehole in Ch\u00e3o Bom have high to very high EC and \n\nsalinity values. The two nearby boreholes in Ribeira Grande valley are 1 km from the \n\ncoastline. All the water samples are of NaCl type, and surpass the 0.5 g.L\n-1\n TDS limits, (table \n\n7.21 and 7.22). The groundwater in Ch\u00e3o Bom is a seawater-freshwater mixing with salinity \n\ndecreasing after the rainy season. The seawater amount ranges from 4% at borehole up to \n\n7.5% at wells. TDS content in Ribeira Grande is smaller because boreholes are less deep, \n\ninland flow is higher and salinity comes most certainly from a water-rock interaction process. \n\nAnthropogenic influence seems to be also present, especially at borehole FT-27 as both \n\nboreholes are nowadays within the village, (figures 7.124 to 7.129).

As Cl amount in the local volcanic \n\nrocks is rather low (Alves et al. 1979), the measured quantities can be seen as a benchmark \n\nof the groundwater origin and evolution in Santiago\u2019s island, with the advantage of a \n\nconservative behaviour. The other groundwater ionic elements and compounds are mostly \n\nfrom water-rock interaction along the underground path way. The Chloride enrichment \n\nprocess over the typical inland NaHCO3 water is happening at valleys downstream; very near \n\nthe ocean by direct fresh-seawater mixing and ion exchange when low head and flow \n\nhydraulic conditions occur and from deep salty layer influence by leaching and dissolution of \n\nancient marine sediments, probably induced by borehole overexploitation, at mid valleys and \n\nfar from the coastline. Nevertheless, the marine aerosol spray cannot be excluded as \n\nanother source of salinity. Soil irrigation with brackish waters also increases the salt content \n\nat valley shallow depths. \n\n \n\nThe groundwater salinity can be thus given by Chlorinities, and related to sea distance and \n\nbulk TEM resistivity. Figure 7.130 shows waters Chloride (TDS percentage) versus sea \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n_________________________________ \n\n 252\n\ndistance at the surveyed valleys. A linear trend can be assigned with decreasing Cl \n\npercentage inland and a shoreline value of 42% (less than pure seawater).

At \n\n5.3 km, the Cl is about 10 % of TDS amount. This is the mean measured value detected at \n\ninland locations. \n\n \n\nA fit can be also found to the total Cl per litre amount, with a high increase going towards the \n\nsea, to around 15 g.L\n-1\n at the coastline (under Cl content seawater), figure 7.131, below. \n\n \n\nFigure 7.131 \u2013 Groundwater\u2019s Cl amount versus distance to the sea. \n\n \n\n     Cl ? ????????? !\"#$,&amp;'  mg.L\n-1\n   (7.2) \n\n \n\nExpression (7.2) will give lesser Cl content very near the sea, when the comparison is done \n\nagainst respective sample data.

An inverse relationship is found. With the \n\navailable data, two separate sample groups are noted; the nearest to sea and high Cl \n\ncontent (above 1 g.L\n-1\n, group I) and inland ones (Cl content below that value, group II). The \n\nformer ones are detected by TEM measures within the 1.5 to 3 ohm.m range and the latter \n\nones within the 8 to 20 ohm.m range. These values are linked to lithologic environment, \n\nnotably to porosity, which can be assumed with a mean value of 15% all over the studied \n\nvalleys. \n\n \n\nFigure 7.132 \u2013 Groundwater\u2019s Chloride versus bulk TEM resistivity. \n\n \n\n     Cl ? ????()  mg.L\n-1\n    (7.3) \n\n \n\nwith a mean 25% error. The ?b is the modelled TEM bulk resistivity value (in ohm.m). \n\n \n\nWith this calibration factor, and taking into account that no other lithology (whether saturated \n\nor not), exhibits similar low resistivities as group I, one would expect that the hydrogeological \n\ninterpretation of the TEM sounding data within and even below the above-mentioned \n\nresistivity range represents a high content of Chloride, and thus a high salinity groundwater. \n\nSome clay could exhibit similar low resistivities, like Bentonite (formed by weathered volcanic \n\nash). Bentonite outcrops were detected at eastern Santiago (Jo\u00e3o Coroado, personal \n\ncommunication) but this clay type is almost Chloride free, and could not be responsible for \n\nthe detected deep low electric resistivities. \n\n \n\nWith this assumption and taking expression (7.3), the deep low resistivity layer must have at \n\nleast a Chloride equivalent concentration of 2.5 to 5 g per litre, and at least a TDS amount 5 \n\nto 10 g per litre. \n\n \n\nMerging the previous expressions, the groundwater quality, given as TDS amount can be \n\nderived as a function of both TEM resistivities and sea distance: \n\n \n\n    TDS ? ????()\n???\n\n??-?,???????? !\"# mg.L\n-1\n   (7.4) \n\n \n\nwith a mean 25% error.  \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n_________________________________ \n\n 254\n\nBellow, the figure 7.133 displays the TDS content throughout the S. Domingos valley using \n\nexpression (7.4). The values are computed for the shallow groundwater near the sea, the \n\nseawater intrusion beneath it and for groundwater inland. As detected, seashore \n\ngroundwater salinity is higher, both superficially and at depth, with seawater mixing from 5 to \n\n12% (TDS from 3000 to 6000 mg.L\n-1\n). At inland this salinity is lower with a mean of 650 mg.L\n\n-\n\n1\n, somewhat less than the measured samples (but within the error), as it comes from a mean \n\nfit expression for all (fewer) calibration samples. \n\nFigure 7.133 \u2013 Computed groundwater mean TDS at S. Domingos valley. \n\n \n\nThe same procedure was applied to the remaining surveyed valleys. At Seca and Picos \n\nvalleys, the expected behaviour of near sea shallow influence results in high TDS content (as \n\ndirect EC measures have shown) with values in the 1,5 to 5 g.L\n-1\n range (seawater mixing \n\nfrom 4 to 14%). Inland values are smaller, from 400 to 1000 mg.L\n-1\n, figure 7.134. \n\nFigure 7.134 \u2013 Computed groundwater mean TDS at Seca and Picos valleys. \n\n \n\nA \u201cdiscontinuity TDS step\u201d seems to exist at both S. Domingos and Picos valleys, after the \n\ninitial decreasing values. This can be related to changing lithology (less thick Quaternary \n\nalluvium) and also to overexploitation and inducing a vertical flow of the high conductive \n\ndeep layer, beyond these distances.  \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n_________________________________ \n\n 255\n\nAt Salto, Flamengos and S. Miguel, computed TDS values are all about 1000 mg.L\n-1\n. Inland \n\nhigher values could be related to lithologic variations, and to the boreholes influence. Near \n\nthe sea, TDS values are higher too, figure 7.135. \n\n \n\nFigure 7.135 \u2013 Computed groundwater mean TDS at Salto, Flamengos and S.

The NE-SW feature between Ch\u00e3o Bom and \n\nRibeira Grande (already shown before, at figure 7.102), is now contoured with high TDS \n\nvalues. These TDS values are all above 2 g.L\n-1\n at Ribeira Grande valley. That\u2019s also true for \n\nCh\u00e3o Bom, except at a small area in the plateaux\u2019s middle, with smaller values. The NE-SW \n\nfeature could be related with some fault/fracture and/or ancient valley filled with salty \n\nmaterial. \n\n \n\nFigure 7.136 \u2013 Computed groundwater mean TDS at Ch\u00e3o Bom (Tarrafal) and Ribeira Grande valley.  \n  \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n_________________________________ \n\n 256\n\n \n\n7.4 \u2013 Simplified SUTRA models \n \n\nTo understand these TDS values, hydrodynamic numerical simulation has been done with \n\nthe well-known and tested U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s SUTRA code. SUTRA (Saturated-\n\nUnsaturated TRAnsport) is a finite-element 3D code to solve a very general set of single-\n\nphase subsurface fluid flow and single-species transport problems, (Voss, 1984). The history \n\nand implementation of SUTRA code, as also a review of major published SUTRA \n\napplications is given in Voss (1999). \n\n \n\nThe code solves numerically two general balance equations: for variable-density single-\n\nphase saturated-unsaturated flow and for single-species solute (or energy) transport, based \n\nupon Bear (1979) formulations. First equation, for seawater intrusion (i.e. variable density \n\nsaturated flow with non-reactive solute transport of TDS or Chloride) is the general fluid mass \n\nbalance equation (usually referred as the groundwater flow model), given by: \n\n \n\n   ./01\n21\n23 4 5\n\n2(\n26\n\n26\n23 ? 7 \u00b7 9:\n\n;(\n&lt;= \u00b7 ?7> ? .??@ ?

The DWLkl and DWLQi are the transverse \ndispersivities for flow in the maximum and minimum permeability directions, respectively. The \n\nmno is the angle between the maximum permeability direction to the local flow direction. \nThese definitions allow the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities to vary in a time-\n\ndependent manner at any point depending on the flow\u2019s direction. Usually, longitudinal \n\ndispersivity is about one hundred times more intense at horizontal than by vertical direction. \n\nTransverse dispersivity is usually held constant, i.e. independent of flow direction, (Voss, \n\n1999). \n\n \n\nA simplified 3D model for the axial mid valley is tested with the known hydraulic parameter \n\nvalues to check the validity of the hypothesis of the deep conductive layer to behave as a \n\nsalinity groundwater source, other than inland water-rock interaction. The near ocean shallow \n\nfresh to seawater mixing was also tested, upon the conditions detected by TEM soundings. \n\n \n\nFor the SUTRA simulation of the first situation, a uniform rectangular model with a 2000 m \n\nlong (x-direction), 400 m wide (y-direction) and 70 to 50 m depth (z-direction), with the \n\nconstant bottom at 50 m below msl was tested. A tridimensional mesh dimension was set \n\nwith 160\u00d720\u00d740 finite element (rectangular elements). Applied hydraulic parameters are \n\npresented at table 7.23. Most of them are unknown to actual problem and thus initially taken \n\nfrom published similar cases, as the Hawaii Oahu island basaltic aquifer (Voss, 1999). A \n\nrange values to the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities have been tested. From 100 to \n\n1000 for the longitudinal dispersivity. From 0 to 10 for the transverse dispersivity. \n\n \n\nThe final and chosen values, that are compatible with observed and measured data, are \n\ngiven at table 7.23. \n  \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n_________________________________ \n\n 258\n\nTable 7.23 \u2013 Applied hydraulic parameters at first SUTRA simulation. \n\nParameter value \n\nFreshwater density 1000 kg.m\n-3 \n\nSeawater density 1026 kg.m\n-3\n \n\nWater compressibility\n \n\n4.47\u00d710\n-10\n\n Pa\n-1 \n\nWater viscosity\n \n\n0.001 kg.m\n-1\n.s\n\n-1 \n\nMolecular diffusivity 1.5\u00d710\n-9\n m\n\n2\n.s\n\n-1 \n\nMatrix compressibility 2.5\u00d710\n-9\n Pa\n\n-1\n \n\nHorizontal hydraulic permeability 5\u00d710\n-12\n\n m\n2\n \n\nVertical hydraulic permeability 1\u00d710\n-12\n\n m\n2\n \n\nPorosity 0.15 \nHorizontal Longitudinal dispersivity  250 m \n\nVertical Longitudinal dispersivity  25 m \nHorizontal Transverse dispersivity 1,0 m \n\nVertical Transverse dispersivity 1,0 m \n \n\nBoundary conditions were set to the inland and ocean sides, as also to the surface and \n\nbottom ones. Lateral wedge boundaries are closed to fluid flow. A flux was set from inland \n\nside, corresponding to calculated infiltration rates. At the seaward boundary, the usual \n\nhydrostatic seawater pressure is held together with seawater concentration. Top surface \n\nrecharge is also included with known values. At the bottom wedge, upward flow represents \n\nthe main inland regional discharge with seawater concentration\u2019s equivalent, from the high \n\nEC salty layer effect. All these values are constant over time, and an equilibrium condition \n\n(steady-state) was sought with the given hydraulic parameters, outputting a concentration \n\nspatial distribution field. \n\n \n\nThe model spatial discretization must be set in order to avoid general oscillations in the \n\nconcentration distribution, with finite-element size limitation. This is related to the mesh \n\nPeclet number criterion (Voss. 1984): \n\n \n\n     PeL ?\n|F|?U\\\n\n?r]h[\\|F|?\n    (7.13a) \n\n \n\nwhere ?sU is the local distance between element sides along a streamline of flow. Stability is \nguaranteed in all cases when PeL t 2. This criterion significantly affects discretization. \nSpatial stability is usually obtained with SUTRA when PeL t 4 , which gives a less-stringent \ncriterion. In the case of solute transport with longitudinal dispersion primarily due to \n\nlongitudinal mixing, the mesh Peclet number becomes: \n\n \n\n     PeL u\n?U\\\n[\\\n\n     (7.13b) \n\n \n\nConditions are then defined by ?sU t 4DU and ?sU v 10DW (Voss and Provost, 2003). \n \n\nTaking this into account and the boundary conditions, summarized in table 7.24 for two \n\nscenarios (higher and lower inland and surface recharge flow) the TDS (salinity) \n\nconcentration field was computed via SUTRA. The higher to low flux is regarded as the \n\nseasonal rainy effect at shallow depth. Results for the two described scenarios are shown at \n\nfigure 7.137.

To confirm the effect of a borehole \n\noverexploitation, a SUTRA simulation was also done with the borehole in the centre of the \n\nmodel and depth position of 30 m below msl.

That\u2019s because \n\nborehole sink breaks and disturbs local equilibrium between the downstream horizontal and \n\nbottom upper vertical flux, with this latter overwhelming beyond this position (some small \n\nnumerical instability is also superimposed). This same kind of signature seems to be present \n\nin TEM resistivity cross sections at S. Domingos valley, near boreholes FT-26 and FT-38 (fig. \n\n7.15), and borehole FT-6 in Seca valley (fig.7.29), and could be the explanation of those \n\ngeometric features. \n\n \n\nUnder these conditions, TDS asset value in the borehole is about 1500 mg.L\n-1\n. This amount \n\nwill change upon borehole sink rate and also with the prevailing local hydraulic parameters. \n\n\n\nTEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS \n_________________________________ \n\n 260\n\nThus, the reasonable explanation to measured groundwater TDS and Chloride content (as \n\nwell the conductive TEM values) can indeed be the deep enriched salty layer. \n\nOverexploitation just induces and increases the water's salinity amount. Far from the \n\ncoastline, by the prevailing dynamic conditions, it\u2019s impossible for the modern seawater to be \n\nthe salinity main source. \n\n \n\nFigure 7.138 \u2013 Borehole overexploitation effect at mid valley. Cross section perspective view of 3D \n\nSUTRA simulated TDS groundwater\u2019s values, (colour scale is the same of fig. 7.137). \n\n \n\nFor the SUTRA second simulation, a uniform rectangular sheet like model with a 1600 m \n\nlong (x-direction), 400 m wide (y-direction) and 37 to 35 m depth (z-direction), with the \n\nconstant bottom at 35 m below msl was tested.

The tested and applied hydraulic \n\nparameters are presented at table 7.25, for the two zone layers. The remaining system \n\nparameter values are the same as the previous ones. The output TDS groundwater \n\nconcentrations are much independent on the porosity values at this dispersive environment \n\nmodel. Under this scenario, with no groundwater withdrawal, the mixing waters reach a \n\nconcentration state as shown at figure 7.139, with a 4 to 5 g.L\n-1\n near the coastline and a null \n\neffect beyond 1300 m.

Most of the TEM soundings within the \n\nrepetition\u2019s framework were acquired exactly at the same initial position. Geographic \n\ncoordinates of the soundings were taken by a GPS hand unit, under the WGS84 geodetic \n\nDatum (or converted to) with a horizontal assigned error of about 10 m. After, sometimes the \n\nreturn to the exact site was impossible due to changes on lands motivated by agricultural \n\nworks. On this occasion, the sounding\u2019s position offset from original position was small, one \n\nloop size distance at most. Some repetitions, when possible, were also acquired with a larger \n\n50 m \u00d7 50 m single loop size. The TEM-FAST 48 time mode acquisition was not always the \n\nsame, and that was chosen regarding the observed data quality and available signal power. \n\nQuality of the data soundings and curve points scattering are unequal. The high available \n\npower at the last survey\u2019s fieldwork does not mean better results. The summary of the \n\navailable soundings repetitions have been summarized in table 7.1 of previous chapter. \n\n \n\n \n\n8.1.1 \u2013 2005-2009 S. Domingos valley TEM data \n \n\nAt S. Domingos valley (near Achada Baleia village), the chosen minimum number of sites \n\n(TEM soundings) that have been repeated was four, wrapping extremes and middle valley \n\nlocations. They were the TEM soundings; AB02, AB12, AB26 and AB33. In 2006 fieldworks \n\nonly two sites were easily accessible (AB02 and AB12) since the valley road was flooded at \n\nthe time. In 2008 and 2009 TEM soundings were repeated for 10 sites. \n\n \n\nApparent resistivity curves and 1D mean models of each sounding are shown in figures 8.1 \n\nand 8,2, next page. Model misfit errors are about 5 to 7%. The measured apparent \n\nresistivity\u2019s changes between epochs are due to real changes in the subsurface, but loop \n\nlocation offset cannot be ruled out, especially at AB02 sounding\u2019s site. \n\n \n\nThe comparison of the 1D models from AB02, AB12 and AB26 sites, shows that the top \n\nlayers\u2019 characteristics are roughly the same (as expected). The conductive layer underneath \n\nthe shallow one, representing a seawater-groundwater mixing zone (at AB02 and AB12 \n\nsites), has a change in the resistivity that is compatible with the effect of the measured \n\nannual precipitation in those epochs, as seen in figure 8.3. The assumption that high rainfall \n\nand infiltration decrease the seawater effect at these near sea sites, increasing the shallow \n\ngroundwater resistivity values seems to be confirmed.  \n\n\n\nTEM DATA CHANGES OVER TIME \n______________________________ \n\n 264\n\nFigure 8.1 \u2013 Apparent resistivity TEM sounding curves at S.

Comparison is done \n\nagainst annual precipitation registered at S. Jorge dos Org\u00e3os meteorological station, at \n\nmiddle Island, affecting S. Domingos hydropraphic basin (INMG data). For the given time \n\nspan, the two data sets show an increasing trend with a 0.010 \u00b1 0.001 ?.m.mm\n-1\n for the \n\nAB02 and AB12 soundings. This is a mean value, since figure 8.4 suggests that a 1 to 2 \n\nyears time lag can exist between the two data sets, with the resistivity response delay \n\nimplying a flow velocity in the shallow groundwater of about 20 m.day\n-1\n throughout the valley. \n\n \n\nFigure 8.4 \u2013 Bulk resistivity values (2005-2009) of the shallow aquifer layer AB02 and AB12 sites \n\nversus annual precipitation at S.

It is much more \n\n\n\nTEM DATA CHANGES OVER TIME \n______________________________ \n\n 266\n\nlimited at soundings AB12 and AB26, within 7 to 14 and 10 to 14 ?.m, respectively. A \n\n\u201creverse pattern\u201d and \u201ctrend\u201d is detected at these three TEM soundings (AB02, AB12 and \n\nAB26). The trend shows that the low resistivity values seem to follow the rainiest seasons \n\nand that more water should be interacting or dissolving more salts becaming more \n\nconductive. The deep conductive layer was not always clearly detected, and that is a function \n\nof data quality. At AB02 and AB12 layer depth is compatible with fresh-seawater interface \n\nposition. At sounding AB26 the conductive layer is located at 50 to 60 m below msl. The TEM \n\nsounding AB33 exhibits a high scatter at shallow layer depth positions and also at deep \n\nconductive layer depth position. The most probable explanation is that the very nearby \n\nunattended borehole FT26 was extracting groundwater during sounding\u2019s acquisition, and \n\ndisturbing the free water level and the deep mixing interface. The bulk resistivity ranges from \n\n12 to 20 ?.m. \n\n \n\nThese resistivity values are converted to groundwater salinity (TDS) using equation (7.4) and \n\npresented in figure 8.5. It\u2019s notorious that, although some seasonal variations, computed salt \n\ncontent stays between 410 and 725 mg.L\n-1\n in inland locations, while it changes to higher \n\nvalues, 1700 to 4800 mg.L\n-1\n, at shallow depths near the sea. In between these, at transition \n\nzone, the deep groundwater shows a salinity increase trend. As observed in the previous \n\nsub-chapter 7.3.8, these inland computed values are underestimated and can have an error \n\nof 25-30%. Knowing this and the groundwater chemistry (NaCl type) at valley, this can be \n\ntranslated to a groundwater Chloride content of between 200 and 350 mg.L\n-1\n and also \n\nequivalent contemporary seawater mixing of 1 to 2%. \n\n \n\nFigure 8.5 \u2013 Computed groundwater TDS amounts (2005-2009), at S. Domingos valley. \n\n \n\n \n\n8.1.2 \u2013 2005-2009 Seca and Picos valleys TEM data \n \n\nAt Seca valley, the number of repeated TEM soundings at exactly the same sites were two; \n\nsounding SECA16 near the sea and sounding SECA21 at shallow seawater influence \n\ntransition zone. Also between these sounding\u2019s locations, two more extra soundings were \n\ndone and repeated during the two last survey epochs (SECA17A and 18A). At Picos valley \n\nthere were three repeated sites; sounding PICOS04, PICOS10 and PICOS12, at mid valley, \n\nwith the last two ones not covering all survey period.  \n\n\n\nTEM DATA CHANGES OVER TIME  \n______________________________ \n\n 267\n\nData curves and 1D models for each of those soundings are presented in figures 8.6 and \n\n8.7, for Seca valley and in figures 8.9 and 8,10 for Picos valley. In the year 2008 the TEM \n\nsoundings SECA16 and 21 were acquired with 50 m \u00d7 50 m loop. Mean model misfit errors \n\nare about 6 and 7% for Seca and Picos soundings, respectively. \n\n \n\nThe near to sea SECA16 sounding models exhibit greater variability, notoriously that one \n\nrepeated in 2008 (an incorrect site location is a possible cause). The shallow groundwater \n\nresistivity layer varies from 2 to 6-8 ?.m, and groundwater mixing seems to be rather \n\nindependent of time, probably from greater well water exploitation, reducing the natural \n\noutflow to the sea. Underneath this, basaltic aquifer layer resistivity ranges from 2 to 10 ?.m, \n\nand the deep conductive layer is detected at roughly 50 m below msl. The models for \n\nsoundings SECA21, SECA17A and 18A are much more invariant over time with shallow \n\ngroundwater layer resistivity from 4 to 6 ?.m. The basaltic aquifer layer bellow is less \n\nresistive with values from 2 to 3 ?.m. The deep conductive layer can be detected at the best \n\nsounding data curves, with resistivity values under 1 ?.m, but not well constrained. \n\n \n\nFigure 8.6 \u2013 Apparent resistivity TEM sounding curves at Seca valley (SECA16, 17A, 18A and 21). \n\n \n\nAs before, a comparison against the precipitation at S. Jorge dos Org\u00e3os meteorological \n\nstation, located at Seca hydropraphic basin head, was done. Variation in resistivity has a less \n\nexpressive slope at SECA16 site, with an increasing trend of just 0.002 ?.m.mm\n-1\n and a \n\ndecreasing 0.010 ?.m.mm\n-1\n trend at SECA21 site, figure 8.8. This behaviour is explained by \n\nthe fact that groundwater extraction is more significant at those places, especially near \n\nSECA21 location.  \n\n\n\nTEM DATA CHANGES OVER TIME \n______________________________ \n\n 268\n\nFigure 8.7 \u2013 1D models from repetition soundings (SECA16, 17A, 18A and 21). \n\n \n\nFigure 8.8 \u2013 Bulk resistivity values (2005-2009) of the shallow aquifer layer SECA16 and SECA21 \n\nsites, versus annual precipitation at S.

At mid of the TEM profile (PICOS04 \n\nsounding) the superficial basaltic aquifer layer shows resistivity values from 11 to 13 ?.m, \n\nfollowed by lower resistive values 2 to 5 ?.m. Insights to deep conductive layer, beyond 50 m \n\nbelow msl, is given at some soundings. \n\n \n\nFigure 8.9 \u2013 Apparent resistivity TEM sounding curves and 1D models from \n\nrepetition sites at Picos valley, (PICOS04, 10 and 12). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nTEM DATA CHANGES OVER TIME \n______________________________ \n\n 270\n\nResults of the calculated bulk resistivity values to groundwater salinity (TDS) conversion are \n\nshown in figure 8.10 and 8.11, for Seca and Picos valleys, respectively. Almost all these \n\ncomputed values are high above the 1000 mg.L\n-1\n. At both valleys, the shallow groundwater \n\nTDS content decreases inland, in accordance with direct measure\u2019s indications. Underneath \n\nthis, at Seca valley deep waters are even more salty to inland, over this distance range. At \n\nPicos valley, the behaviour is similar with deeper groundwater becoming also more salty to \n\ninland. \n\n \n\nAt Picos valley computed TDS values (from bulk resistivity) at shallow groundwater exhibit \n\nhigh scatter than values from Seca valley, with no conclusive TDS trend in time. To this NaCl \n\nwater type, the highest TDS values correspond to a mean Chloride content of 500 and 800 \n\nmg.L\n-1\n, respectively, for Seca and Picos shallow groundwaters, and slightly higher at greater \n\ndepths, near the coastline. This corresponds to equivalent (contemporary) seawater mixing \n\nof 2.5 and 4% at shallow waters, respectively for Seca and Picos. Beyond this sea distance, \n\nTDS values are known to diminish, in accordance with the remaining TEM soundings and \n\ndirect measures (subchapter 7.3.8). \n\n \n\nFigure 8.10 \u2013 Computed groundwater TDS amounts (2005-2009), at Seca valley. \n\n \n\nFigure 8.11 \u2013 Computed groundwater TDS amounts (2005-2009), at Picos valley. \n\n\n\nTEM DATA CHANGES OVER TIME  \n______________________________ \n\n 271\n\n \n\n8.1.3 \u2013 2006-2009 Salto, Flamengos and S.Miguel valleys TEM data \n \n\nAt Salto valley, four TEM soundings have been repeated at the same site: soundings \n\nSALTO03, SALTO04, SALTO06 and SALTO07, in the years 2008 and 2009. At Flamengos \n\nvalley, three soundings (FL02, FL05 and FL06), were repeated since 2007. For S. Miguel \n\nvalley, three soundings (SM01, SM04 and SM08) were repeated at each year subsequent to \n\ninitial survey (2007). \n\n \n\nApparent resistivity curves and 1D models for each of those soundings are shown in figures \n\n8.12 to 8.15. The mean misfit errors range from 5 to 10%, for TEM acquired at Salto, and are \n\nabout the same order for Flamengos and S.Miguel. Soundings from 2008 are observed to be \n\nnoisier, with higher scatter in the late time points. \n\n \n\nThe SALTO03 and SALTO04 soundings were always done at exactly the same site. The \n\nother two soundings, SALTO06 and SALTO07, due to landscape conditions and lack of \n\nuseful landmarks, were repeated as close as possible to the original ascribed coordinates. \n\nThese latter soundings show a greater variability that can be, to some extent, committed to \n\nthat offset, revealing local 2D or 3D geometry effects, figures 8.12 to 8.13. At Flamengos \n\nthese behaviours were not observed, with rather smooth and similar soundings, figure 8.14. \n\nThe same sounding localization difficulties were present at S.Miguel TEM sounding SM08. \n\n \n\nIn Salto, the soundings nearest to the sea (SALTO03 and SALTO04) show almost no \n\nchange, with shallow groundwater resistivity layer staying between 3 and 4 ?.m. At roughly \n\n40 m below msl, the resistivity increases to about 7 ?.m. This latter value is better \n\nconstrained at SALTO03 sounding. The other two repeated soundings are much more \n\nproblematic; at SALTO06 the resistivity of the basaltic aquifer layer varies between 6 and 17 \n\n?.m and at SALTO07 is even higher, between 14 and 36 ?.m. In both these soundings the \n\nresistivity decreases with depth to low values, not well constrained by models, but below the \n\n7 ?.m. \n\n \n\nSoundings in Flamengos are much alike, with shallow groundwater resistivity staying \n\nbetween 3 and 4 ?.m (FL02), 6 to 9 ?.m (FL05) and about 8 ?.m (FL06). Both, first survey \n\nand repetitions have been taken just after the rain season, with 2006 season being rainiest \n\nthan 2007 one (resistivities for 2006 are accordingly higher). Deeper at about 50 m bellow \n\nmsl, the resistivity also decreases to low values, bellow 3 ?.m. \n\n \n\nAt S. Miguel valley, the SM01 and SM04 soundings and models are much alike with major \n\ndifferences in deeper layers, arising from the scatter in the data, figure 8.15. The shallow \n\ngroundwater resistivity values are estimated between 7 and 10 ?.m, and the basaltic aquifer \n\nresistivity is about 3 ?.m. A deep conductive layer is detected at about 50 m bellow msl, with \n\nresistivity values between 0.5 to 4 ?.m, \n\n \n\nThe superficial unsaturated layers at these valleys are always much more resistive than any \n\nother observed layer and had stayed in a practically unchanged trough the time. \n  \n\n\n\nTEM DATA CHANGES OVER TIME \n______________________________ \n\n 272\n\nFigure 8.12 \u2013 Apparent resistivity TEM sounding curves at Salto valley (SALTO03, 04, 06 and 07). \n\nFigure 8.13 \u2013 1D models from repetition soundings (SALTO03, 04, 06 and 07). \n\n\n\nTEM DATA CHANGES OVER TIME  \n______________________________ \n\n 273\n\nFrom these bulk resistivity values, the groundwater salinity (TDS) conversion gives the \n\nresults, shown in figure 8.16 to 8.18, respectively for Salto, Flamengos and S.Miguel valleys. \n\nAt Salto, salinity decrease inland with values staying more or less constant over time (2000 \n\nto 600 mg.L\n-1\n). The inland samples show a decreasing trend. From the groundwater type and \n\nchemical composition, these values are translated to a mean Chloride content of 1000 to 300 \n\nmg.L\n-1\n, (with the greater values closest to shoreline) or to a equivalent contemporary \n\nseawater mixing from 5 to 1.5%. \n\n \n\nFigure 8.14 \u2013 Apparent resistivity TEM sounding curves and 1D models from \n\nrepetition sites at Flamengos valley, (FL02, 05 and 06).  \n\n\n\nTEM DATA CHANGES OVER TIME \n______________________________ \n\n 274\n\nAt Flamengos valley, the same trend is observed, with TDS decreasing inland, between 2000 \n\nand 1000 mg.L\n-1\n, and being higher in the repeated soundings of 2007. This stands in \n\nagreement to a greater infiltration and water flush in year 2006. These salinity values are \n\ntranslated to a mean Chloride content ranging from 800 to 400 mg.L\n-1\n, with higher values \n\nbeing found nearest to the coastline. This corresponds to an equivalent contemporary \n\nseawater mixing of 4 to 2%. The deepest detected conductive layer, assuming the same kind \n\nof aquifer behaviour, must have salinity greater than 3 g.L\n-1\n and Chloride content greater \n\nthan 1.2 g.L\n-1\n and equivalent contemporary seawater mixing of at least 6%. \n\n \n\nFigure 8.15 \u2013 Apparent resistivity TEM sounding curves and 1D models \n\nfrom repetition sites at S.Miguel valley, (SM01, 04 and 08).  \n\n\n\nTEM DATA CHANGES OVER TIME  \n______________________________ \n\n 275\n\nAt S.Miguel valley, the inland decreasing TDS tendency is also present.

All have been taken along a profile line at Ch\u00e3o Bom north side, over \n\nTAR02 to TAR06 initial sounding\u2019s direction, each year after 2005 (to the exception of 2008) \n\nas plotted at figure 8.19.  \n\n \n\nThe mean 1D model was obtained for each TEM sounding, shown in figure 8.20. The \n\ncorresponding resistivity cross section, done by stitching the models, is shown in figure 8.21. \n\nThe figure includes all the four-year profiles with their relative position to each other, all with \n\nthe same resistivity colour scale. The model\u2019s responses to data curve\u2019s misfit are about 4 to \n\n8%. \n\n \n\nFigure 8.19 \u2013 Location of original (2005) and repetition soundings \n\nat northwest Tarrafal (Ch\u00e3o Bom), (2006-2009). \n\n \n\nAs expected, the overall layer\u2019s geometry seems to be mostly unchanged, but some real \n\nresistivity variations are detected trough the time (that couldn\u2019t be ascribed to models\u2019 \n\nequivalence or error misfit). The major changes take place at the deepest layer, with higher \n\nresistivity values in 2006 and 2009 years, figure 8.22. Those changes mean that TDS values \n\nat depth 30 m below msl oscillated between about 3000 to 1500 mg.L\n-1\n, or 1 to 0.5 g.L\n\n-1\n \n\nChloride content, respectively. \n  \n\n\n\nTEM DATA CHANGES OVER TIME  \n______________________________ \n\n 277\n\nFigure 8.20 \u2013 Apparent resistivity TEM sounding curves at northwest Tarrafal (Ch\u00e3o Bom) \n\nfrom 2005 to 2009. \n\n \n\nAlthough the measured resistivity variations seem to be directly correlated with the registered \n\nprecipitation amounts (figure 8.3), the groundwater mixing with this rainwater infiltration flush \n\nwould turn out into higher resistivity values in the inland side, gradually decreasing resistivity \n\ntowards the sea. That is partially verified at shallow layers but not completely fulfilled at all \n\nprofile\u2019s length and depth. One hypothesis to explain this behaviour is the already mentioned \n\nmechanism of mixing of groundwater with upcoming flux from the deep salty enrichment \n\nolder waters, as no disturbance by groundwater exploitation is done at or near these TEM \n\nsounding. \n\n \n\nA two to one water mixing ratio, with the higher value being from the deep conductive layer, \n\nand the smaller from the shallow layer, is sufficient to justify the observed variations, \n\nassuming that deep layer has the suggested present day equivalent seawater salinity. An \n\neven smaller mixing ratio will be verified if the deep layer is under brine like condition. \n\n \n\nAt groundwater depths, where borehole screens are usually installed, it is expected that the \n\nTDS observed changes aren\u2019t directly linked to recent rainfall events. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nTEM DATA CHANGES OVER TIME \n______________________________ \n\n 278\n\nFigure 8.21 \u2013 Resistivity cross sections at northwest Tarrafal (Ch\u00e3o Bom), 2005-2009. \n\n \n  \n\n\n\nTEM DATA CHANGES OVER TIME  \n______________________________ \n\n 279\n\nFigure 8.22 \u2013 Cross sections resistivities values (ohm.m) \n\nat northwest Tarrafal (Ch\u00e3o Bom), 2005-2009. \n  \n\n\n\nTEM DATA CHANGES OVER TIME \n______________________________ \n\n 280\n\n \n\n8.2 \u2013 TEM versus Rainfall correlation \n \n\nThe relation between the registered precipitation and the time measured bulk electric \n\nresistivity changes to the groundwater layers (water\u2019s TDS) are seen to be of different origin, \n\nin respect to near sea shallow groundwater and to deep groundwater. \n\n \n\nIn S. Domingos, Seca and Picos valleys, the near coastline shallow groundwaters quality (i.e. \n\nsalinity or TDS content) are directly related to the correspondent rainfall quantities in the \n\nrespective hydrographic basin. This is controlled by local confining or semi-confining layers \n\nthat allow the seawater to encroach into inland and mix with freshwater when the \n\ngroundwater table is below the upper confining layer limit. That can happen by; groundwater \n\noverexploitation, natural system discharges depression long after the rainy season or under \n\na prevailing wet condition. The relation between rainfall and bulk resistivity of the shallow \n\nlayer is of the order of 0.010 ?.m.mm\n-1\n. \n\n \n\nThe bulk resistivity variations in the basaltic aquifer are due to the groundwater resistivity. \n\nThis groundwater is a mixing from the sub-superficial inland waters, already changed by rock \n\ninteraction, and deep upward flow of waters with high dissolved salt\u2019s content. The measured \n\ngroundwater EC value depends on its ionic content, and that can be changed by the mixing \n\nof different inland waters. The time changes come only from the time changes on the \n\nrecharge rates, and that can be difficult to track when mixing occurs, as isotopic measures \n\nshowed. Nevertheless, those resistivity time changes can be compared against the available \n\nprecipitation time series, back to the early 60 of last century, figure 8.23. The simple Pearson \n\ncorrelation coefficient between the short resistivity time sets and the wider rainfall ones was \n\ndone for the several soundings\u2019 repetitions. For some valleys, the correlation was poor and \n\nno apparent relations between the two data sets were found. \u201cConclusive results\u201d come from \n\nthe S. Domingos valley, were the four soundings spanning the 2005-2009 period. The results \n\nseem to indicate a spatial flow evolution where a strong negative Pearson coefficient is \n\ndetected (-0.90 to -0.98 range). \n\nFigure 8.23 \u2013 Annual S.

The observed correlation holds like described in table 8.1, \n\nwith the corresponding year and time delay getting higher as distance to hydrographic head \n\nbasin increases. The travel mean time for this deep upstream flow influence is of about 30 \n\nyears, which is a similar and compatible result to the ascribed values in chapter 6.

That is especially important for areas where the watershed points \n\nare sparse. \n\n \n\nTo this purposes the TEM data spatial density is higher than local watersheds, giving \n\naltogether information about deep layers, beyond the depth of the existent boreholes. At \n\nSantiago Island, the present study showed that groundwater quality in coastline valleys, \n\nregarding to salinity, has two distinct origins. \n\n \n\nFrom the available data and their analysis, the conclusion is that groundwater quality, i.e. its \n\nTDS content (furthermore its usefulness), apart from rock interaction enrichment, is naturally \n\naffected by the rainfall amount at each hydrographic basin. \n\n \n\nIn Santiago, the shallow seashore aquifer system, especially in the south-eastern coastline \n\nvalleys, are under direct influence of seawater and attains a strong seasonal salinity variation \n\neffect. This effect is a consequence of valley\u2019s lithological geometry, with local impervious to \n\nsemi-pervious layers allowing the seawater shallow mixing, as simulation had shown. The \n\nproblem increases by the groundwater overexploitation at the annual dry period or under \n\nlong time waterless condition, when groundwater salinity is high. Land irrigation from these \n\nwells and shallow boreholes, enhances even further the soil and water salinity. This \n\nprocedure has changed the soil in these fertile valleys, into unproductive or low productive \n\nones. The solution to decrease land salty content is to start irrigation with less salty inland \n\nsources, like from springs, boreholes, water dam reservoir or desalinized waters. Another \n\nsolution, already tested with success at a small scale in the valleys between Picos and Salto, \n\nis to insert a deep concrete wall, side to side near the end of the valley to stop the seawater \n\nencroachment and its mixing with fresh or brackish water (Ant\u00f3nio Pina, personal \n\ncommunication). \n\n \n\nConcerning the deep groundwater, available in boreholes, its extraction usually starts 1 km \n\nfrom the coastline, onward. The TEM survey data have shown in most valleys a conductive \n\nlayer below mean sea level (at roughly 50 m depth). These low resistivity values can be \n\nassociated to seawater salt\u2019s deposition (evaporites) in the course of ancient low level \n\nseawater episodes. This deep layer can be also the source to the higher Chloride water \n\ncontent. The shallow direct infiltration of recent meteoric waters and the deeper and older \n\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS \n_______________ \n\n 286\n\nones with larger-scale time and path way from central mountain regions, mix in the valleys \n\nends. The mixing is certainly not constant because both groundwater flows (deep and \n\nshallow) must be changing with precipitation recharge rates over the years. The data seems \n\ncompatible with a deep groundwater flow of about 30 years long (although care must be \n\ntaken regarding the analyses from the few TEM variability data set). This mixing can be also \n\ninduced by the overexploitation conditions in boreholes, increasing the water salt content \n\nfrom upward flow across salty layers, as the numerical flow simulations showed. There is no \n\ndirect and easy solution to this problem. The action is to impose a groundwater extraction \n\nlimit at each borehole in these valleys, compatible with a given allowed TDS maximum value. \n\nEach borehole groundwater extraction rate should change throughout seasons and also from \n\nyear to year. Monitoring the groundwater EC periodically could easily give the desired \n\ninformation to assign that extraction rate limit. However, the observed and actual reality, is \n\nthat the local authorities have been unsuccessful, applying to boreholes and wells a number \n\nof hours per day extraction limits. \n\n \n\nFor irrigation purposes, the present groundwater chemical characterization is adequate. It \n\ncould help to delineate, altogether with soil classification, the agricultural specimens to \n\nachieve the best yields with the available water quality. The condition is that present yields \n\nare progressively decreasing for traditional plants because the water and soil salinity within \n\nvalleys is increasing. \n\n \n\nBut available groundwater chemical data is insufficient to search out finer details about \n\nshallow and deeper waters. The mixing conditions on borehole water sampling surely had \n\naffected the joint TEM and hydrochemistry interpretation, superimposing a higher scatter on \n\nthe data. In the present conditions, most of the boreholes have multi screens placed at \n\nseveral depths producing a groundwater extra mixing. Taking this into account, care must be \n\nalso taken with future chemical water sampling. If possible, the use of water grab samplers in \n\nthe boreholes from several depths is preferable. Borehole continuous water EC logging \n\nprofiles would also be very useful to help interpretation. Furthermore, an accurate \n\ntopographic levelling with centimetres precision of the watersheds (wells and boreholes) is \n\ndesired, to achieve a better knowledge about groundwater levels. This could be a task to \n\ncarry out after the responsible authority\u2019s conclusion of the Santiago Island watersheds\u2019 \n\ncatalogue. \n\n \n\nConcerning a possible future electromagnetic field work, a higher spatial density and a \n\npowerful transient equipment is recommendable. That will overcome the (present work) weak \n\ninput signal and enhance the SNR, reaching easily to greater depths. Water sampling for \n\nchemical analyses, but especially water parameters (like EC, pH and temperature), as also \n\nwater depth measures should be carried out altogether with upcoming TEM survey. The \n\nsounding\u2019s inversion and modelling will profit from this and also with continuous profiling, \n\ncollated or very nearby soundings, to better fulfil the needs of the 2D and 3D interpretation \n\nmethods, tested in this work. \n\n \n\nThe applied algorithm, for the quasi-2D and quasi-3D inversion, proved to be useful, with \n\nsome intrinsic and natural limitations. The 2D approximation being a LCI method was only \n\napplied to those surveyed valleys where the TEM soundings were acquired in succession \n\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS \n______________ \n\n 287\n\nalong an almost constant direction. Those 2D starting models were always resistive uniform \n\nwith fixed thickness layers. The 2D inversion results gave similar structures and resistivity \n\nvalues when compared against the simple collated 1D inversion tool from native equipment \n\nsoftware, which gives confidence to the inversion outputs. In general, the global fit between \n\nmodel result\u2019s output and field data gets better with growing lateral distance influence. That \n\ninclusion of more nearby sounding\u2019s data follows the expected behaviour, with smaller rms \n\nmisfit values at the expense of slightly smoothing each sounding model. Beyond the imposed \n\nnumber of fixed layer\u2019s geometry, the distance between soundings (spatial soundings \n\ndensity) is a more relevant issue. When neighbours soundings are further apart, naturally are \n\nnot to expect a really true continuity influence, hence the blocky output observed in some \n\nmodel\u2019s parts. \n\n \n\nThe 3D approximation being a SCI method was consequently applied only to the surveyed \n\nwide areas of S. Domingos and Tarrafal plateaux. The kind of performance from the \n\ninversion algorithm is similar to the 2D approximation. The misfit rms tends to be smaller with \n\nmore soundings inclusion to the inversion, unless the medium owns a more heterogeneous \n\nstructure, like from the Tarrafal area. \n\n \n\nFrom these achieved electric resistivity values, relations between this data and the available \n\nhydrological and groundwater chemical data were found. Those relations are satisfactory and \n\nhold relatively well, concerning the present amount of data. Relations like the TDS inland \n\ndistributions are based upon the deducted porosity, around 15 to 20 %, to both sedimentary \n\nshallow layers and altered and fractured basalts. Upon this and from measured electric \n\nresistivity values, acquired by electromagnetic (or DC) methods, TDS values and \n\ngroundwater quality can be deduced. \n\n \n\nWith nowadays data, the exact Santiago Island hydrologic water balance is difficult to reach. \n\nOnly the bound\u2019s value can be estimated. Nevertheless, it seems that the major problem that \n\nSantiago is faced with, does not concern only to the water available quantity, but as more to \n\ndo with the available quality, especially at the agricultural land irrigation areas. \n\n \n  \n\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS \n_______________ \n\n 288\n\n \n\n\n\n289 \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \nAeschbach?Hertig W., Peeters, F., Beyerle, U., Kipfer, R., 1999.
