Entre as diferentes alternativas \n\nenerg\u00e9ticas existentes, os biocombust\u00edveis representam a op\u00e7\u00e3o mais favor\u00e1vel ao \n\nmeio ambiente.  \n\nOs biocombust\u00edveis podem ser classificados como prim\u00e1rios ou secund\u00e1rios. Os \n\nprim\u00e1rios utilizam material org\u00e2nico que \u00e9 queimado diretamente na sua forma qu\u00edmica \n\nnatural e n\u00e3o modificada, utilizado principalmente para o aquecimento e a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\neletricidade. Os secund\u00e1rios utilizam a biomassa processada que existe na forma \n\ns\u00f3lida, gasosa ou l\u00edquida e podem ser usados para o transporte e em v\u00e1rios processos \n\nindustriais. Os biocombust\u00edveis secund\u00e1rios s\u00e3o ainda classificados como \n\nbiocombust\u00edveis de primeira, segunda e terceira gera\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nOs biocombust\u00edveis de primeira gera\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o produtos derivados de culturas alimentares \n\npara consumo humano. No entanto, a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de terras agr\u00edcolas ar\u00e1veis para a sua \n\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o gera alguma pol\u00e9mica, levando a que muitas ag\u00eancias, particularmente \n\norganiza\u00e7\u00f5es agr\u00edcolas e alimentares assim como modeladores econ\u00f3micos \n\nquestionem o uso desses biocombust\u00edveis, considerando-os como invi\u00e1veis. De modo a \n\ncombater esta controv\u00e9rsia, a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de biocombust\u00edveis a partir de biomassa n\u00e3o-\n\ncomest\u00edvel tem sido favorecida.   \n\nAo contr\u00e1rio dos biocombust\u00edveis de primeira gera\u00e7\u00e3o, a mat\u00e9ria-prima dos \n\ncombust\u00edveis de segunda gera\u00e7\u00e3o prov\u00e9m geralmente de materiais lignocelul\u00f3sicos \n\nn\u00e3o-comest\u00edveis, n\u00e3o competindo com a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de alimentos, eliminando assim a \n\nconcorr\u00eancia com as culturas alimentares. Contudo, estes biocombust\u00edveis n\u00e3o podem \n\nainda ser produzidos economicamente em grande escala, uma vez que a convers\u00e3o de \n\n\n\n \n\niv \n \n\nbiomassa lignocelul\u00f3sica em a\u00e7\u00facares para posterior fermenta\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 um processo \n\ncomplexo, necessitando de equipamentos de produ\u00e7\u00e3o e de processamento mais \n\nsofisticados, mais investimento por unidade de produ\u00e7\u00e3o e instala\u00e7\u00f5es de grande \n\nescala. \n\nOs biocombust\u00edveis de terceira gera\u00e7\u00e3o utilizam microrganismos como uma alternativa \n\n\u00e0s fontes agr\u00edcolas e animais, particularmente microrganismos oleaginosos (aqueles \n\nque t\u00eam a capacidade de acumular quantidades significativas de triacilglicer\u00f3is como \n\nmateriais de reserva, e apresentam um teor de l\u00edpidos superior a 20% do seu peso seco \n\nem biomassa) para produ\u00e7\u00e3o de biodiesel, n\u00e3o apresentando as desvantagens dos \n\nbiocombust\u00edveis de primeira e de segunda gera\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nA maior parte dos trabalhos de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de biodiesel a partir de microrganismos \n\noleaginosos focam-se na utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de microalgas autotr\u00f3ficas. Estas crescem mais \n\nr\u00e1pido, apresentam produtividades de biomassa e de l\u00edpidos mais elevadas e requerem \n\numa menor \u00e1rea de cultivo comparativamente a culturas vegetais. No entanto, tem-se \n\nassistido a uma transi\u00e7\u00e3o para culturas de microalgas heterotr\u00f3ficas devido a maior \n\nfacilidade de cultivo e por apresentarem produ\u00e7\u00e3o mais elevada de \u00e1cidos gordos em \n\nrela\u00e7\u00e3o a culturas autotr\u00f3ficas. \n\nOutros microrganismos heterotr\u00f3ficos produtores de \u00f3leo, nomeadamente bact\u00e9rias, \n\nfungos e leveduras tamb\u00e9m t\u00eam sido considerados como uma fonte promissora de \n\nbiocombust\u00edvel. \n\nA levedura Rhodotorula glutinis \u00e9 uma esp\u00e9cie oleaginosa produtora de caroten\u00f3ides, \n\nprodutos de reserva com alto valor acrescentado de grande interesse comercial com \n\naplica\u00e7\u00f5es nas ind\u00fastrias de alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o animal, farmac\u00eautica e cosm\u00e9tica.  \n\nA produ\u00e7\u00e3o de biocombust\u00edveis de terceira gera\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 um processo complexo e caro, \n\npelo que, neste aspeto, n\u00e3o traz vantagem em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos combust\u00edveis de 1\u00aa gera\u00e7\u00e3o . \n\nContudo, a coprodu\u00e7\u00e3o destes compostos intracelulares em conjunto com os l\u00edpidos da \n\nbiomassa da levedura pode contribuir para reduzir significativamente os custos de \n\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o de biodiesel a partir deste microrganismo. \n\nNeste trabalho, a levedura Rhodosporidium toruloides NCYC 921 (anamorfo de \n\nRhodotorula glutinis) foi cultivada num bioreactor de 7 L com um volume de trabalho de \n\n5 L num sistema semi-cont\u00ednuo com o objetivo de se otimizar a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1cidos \n\ngordos (para a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de biodiesel) e de caroten\u00f3ides. \n\nA estrat\u00e9gia geral de cultivo consistiu em dois passos distintos. Numa primeira fase, \n\nap\u00f3s o desenvolvimento da cultura de levedura em regime descont\u00ednuo, uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde nutrientes foi fornecida de modo a prolongar a fase de crescimento da levedura. Na \n\nsegunda fase, assim que a levedura atingiu a fase estacion\u00e1ria, a solu\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nalimenta\u00e7\u00e3o foi substitu\u00edda por uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o de glucose concentrada (600 g.L\n-1\n\n) para \n\n\n\n \n\nv \n \n\ninduzir a s\u00edntese de materiais de reserva intracelulares, tais como l\u00edpidos e \n\ncaroten\u00f3ides.  \n\nForam realizados quatro ensaios no total. Cada ensaio durou, em m\u00e9dia, uma semana, \n\ntendo sido recolhidas, pelo menos, tr\u00eas amostras por dia. Para cada amostra, foram \n\nanalisados v\u00e1rios par\u00e2metros incluindo a estimativa da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de glucose \n\nresidual por meio de um teste qualitativo utilizando tiras de medi\u00e7\u00e3o da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nglucose, valor de pH e a leitura da absorv\u00eancia a um comprimento de onda de 600 nm. \n\nOutros m\u00e9todos anal\u00edticos inclu\u00edram a determina\u00e7\u00e3o da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de azoto e \n\nglucose residuais, teor de l\u00edpidos totais e teor e composi\u00e7\u00e3o em \u00e1cidos gordos.  \n\nA primeira e \u00faltimas amostras recolhidas a cada dia tamb\u00e9m foram analisadas por \n\ncitometria de fluxo, com o objetivo de detetar, em tempo real, o teor de carotenoides \n\ntotais, assim como a viabilidade celular analisando a integridade da membrana \n\ncitoplasm\u00e1tica e o potencial da membrana mitocondrial em simult\u00e2neo por medi\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nfluoresc\u00eancia emitida por c\u00e9lulas de levedura duplamente coradas com os fluorocromos \n\niodeto de prop\u00eddio e 3,3\u2019-dihexiloxacarbocianina [DiOC6 (3)], respectivamente. \n\nOs dois primeiros ensaios foram realizados a valores de pH constantes. O primeiro foi \n\nrealizado a pH 5,5, enquanto o pH no segundo ensaio foi alterado para 4,0 com o \n\nobjetivo de melhorar a produtividade de biomassa e a produtividade em \u00e1cidos gordos.  \n\nA altera\u00e7\u00e3o de pH no ensaio II resultou num aumento de 23,08% na concentra\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nm\u00e1xima de biomassa (119,61 g.L\n-1\n\n) e um aumento de 10,23% da produtividade m\u00e1xima \n\nde biomassa (1,76 g.L\n-1\n\n) em compara\u00e7\u00e3o com o ensaio I. No entanto, o teor em \u00e1cidos \n\ngordos, percentagem total de lip\u00eddios e concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de caroten\u00f3ides no ensaio II foram \n\nmenores do que no ensaio I devido a problemas associados \u00e0 limita\u00e7\u00e3o de oxig\u00e9nio. \n\nPara os ensaios III e IV, o pH do meio de cultura foi ajustado a 4,0 durante a fase de \n\ncrescimento da levedura e, uma vez que a cultura atingiu a fase estacion\u00e1ria, foi \n\nnovamente ajustado para a 5,0 para promover a acumula\u00e7\u00e3o de produtos lip\u00eddicos de \n\narmazenamento, tais como os caroten\u00f3ides. A \u00fanica diference entre os ensaios III e IV \n\nfoi a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de uma turbina adicional adaptada ao eixo do rotor do bioreactor para o \n\nensaio IV, de modo a garantir uma transfer\u00eancia de oxig\u00e9nio mais eficiente no meio de \n\ncultura. O ensaio IV foi o que apresentou os resultados mais satisfat\u00f3rios, obtendo-se \n\nvalores mais elevados da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de biomassa (154,21 g.L\n-1\n\n), produtividade de \n\nbiomassa (2,35 g.L\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n), produtividade de \u00e1cidos gordos (0,40 g.L\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n), produtividade \n\nde caroten\u00f3ides (0,29 g.L\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n) teor total de caroten\u00f3ides (0,29 mg.g\n-1\n\n) e percentagem \n\nde l\u00edpidos totais (41,07%) face aos restantes ensaios. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: biocombust\u00edveis, biodiesel, Rhodotorula glutinis, Rhodosporidium \n\ntoruloides, carotenoides, \u00e1cidos gordos, semi-cont\u00ednuo, citometria de fluxo \n\n\n\n \n\nvi \n \n\n\n\n \n\nvii \n \n\nAbstract \n\nIn this work the yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides NCYC 921 was grown in a 7 L \n\nbioreactor with a 5 L working volume in a fed-batch system with the aim of optimizing \n\nproduction of fatty acids (for biodiesel purposes) and carotenoids, a high-value added \n\nproduct with commercial interest. Several different cultivation strategies were studied.  \n\nThe first two experiments were performed at constant medium pH. The first fed-batch \n\nwas carried out at a medium pH of 5.5, while the pH in the second assay was changed \n\nto 4.0, with the goal of enhancing biomass productivity and to further improve fatty acid \n\nand carotenoids productivities.  \n\nA dual-stage strategy was used in the third fed-batch cultivation, with the yeast growth \n\nphase conducted at pH 4.0 and the stationary phase, where products accumulation \n\noccurs, was conducted at pH 5.0. These conditions were kept for the fourth assay, with \n\nthe exception of an additional impeller adapted to the bioreactor\u2019s rotor shaft in order to \n\nimprove the oxygen transference in the broth. \n\nAssay four achieved the highest biomass concentration (154.21 g.L\n-1\n\n), biomass \n\nproductivity (2.35 g.L\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n), fatty acid productivity (0.40 g.L\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n), total carotenoid  \n\nconcentration (0.29 mg.g\n-1\n\n), carotenoid productivity (0.29 mg.L\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n) and total lipid \n\ncontent (41.07%), showing that the dual-stage strategy was successful and also that \n\noxygen plays an essential role during the yeast cultivation, particularly in the carotenoid \n\nsynthesis. \n\nFlow cytometry was used to monitor, in real time, total carotenoid content and cell \n\nviability (membrane potential and membrane integrity) throughout the yeast cultivations. \n\nThe data obtained revealed a correlation between carbon source starvation, oxygen \n\ndeficiency and damaged yeast\u2019s cells. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Rhodosporidium toruloides, biodiesel, fatty acids, carotenoids, fed-batch, flow \n\ncytometry. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nviii \n \n\nIndex \n\nAcknowledgements i \n\nResumo iii \n\nAbstract vii \n\nIndex viii \n\nFigure index x \n\nTable index xii \n\nEquation index xiii \n\nList of abbreviations and symbols                 xiv \n\n1.

Introduction \n\n1.1. Fossil fuel: The issue of peak oil and the need for biofuels \n\nThe exploration and use of fossil fuels by mankind is an ongoing practice that has \n\npersisted for millennia and increased significantly about 250 years ago during the dawn \n\nof the Industrial Revolution, becoming the center of growth and trade [1-3]. Several \n\nmajor changes in our civilization since the beginning of the 20th century have increased \n\ndependence on a convenient energy source, mainly crude oil [1].  \n\nFossil energy has grown from insignificant levels in 1800 to an annual output of nearly \n\n10.000 million tons of oil equivalents [3] and still remains the driving force of current \n\nworld economy and backbone of modern society, affecting the everyday lives of \n\nhundreds of millions of people worldwide to a point where it is considered an addiction \n\n[1]. Nowadays, fossil fuel accounts for 86% of global primary energy demand, with crude \n\noil as the greater component, accounting for 36% demand followed by coal and natural \n\ngas at 27% and 23% respectively [4, 5], of which 58% alone is consumed by the \n\ntransport sector [6].  \n\nRecent forecasts by the International Energy Agency (IEA) [7], BP [8] and \n\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [9] indicate a future increase of \n\nfossil fuel demand. However, all fossil fuels are non-renewable energy sources thus they \n\nobviously exist in finite quantities and cannot continue to meet this rising demand \n\nbecause their natural formation on a human scale is so slow (requires millions of years \n\nto create) that it simply cannot augment or replenish them faster than the rate at which \n\nthey are currently being extracted [1- 3, 10, 11]. \n\nConcerns about natural resources depletion is not a recent issue, having been \n\ndiscussed since the end of the 18th to mid 19th centuries [12, 13, 14]. However, an \n\naccurate model for predicting production of finite resources was first published in 1956 \n\nby geophysicist M.K. Hubbert (1903-1989) [15] who, despite great controversy at that \n\ntime [1], correctly predicted that the peak oil (PO) in the US lower 48 states would occur \n\nin 1970 [1-3, 5]. His theory, now named the \u201cHubbert Peak Theory\u201d, represents the \n\nproduction tendency of non-renewable resources by a symmetric bell-shaped curve [1, \n\n2, 5, 11, 16] where production initially increases and eventually reaches its maximum, \n\nrepresented by a peak or a plateau, after which inevitably starts to decline [4, 11, 16, \n\n17]. This happens because, initially, the extraction of an abundant and cheap resource \n\nleads to economic growth and investments increase, promoting further extraction [16]. \n\nThen, resources gradually become technically, energetically and economically more \n\ndifficult to extract [4] (e.g. due to a fall in oil rig pressure and/or water infiltration [17]) and \n\nin time, lack of investment and rising prices result in slowed growth and, eventually, \n\nproduction starts falling to zero [16]. \n\n\n\n \n\n2 \n \n\nThe concept of PO is now well accepted and Hubbert\u2019s theory continues to be the most \n\nwidespread production prediction method used for fossil fuels [1].  \n\nWhen the global production peak will exactly happen is still unknown. In 1998 two \n\ngeologists, Jean Laherr\u00e8re (1931- ) and Colin J. Campbell (1931- ), based on Hubbert\u2019s \n\nresearch, published their own prediction of PO [18] which was expected to happen \n\nbefore 2010. Its influence led to the foundation of the Association for the Study of Peak \n\nOil and gas (ASPO), the first and still the most important international organization which \n\nfocuses on the study of PO [1].   \n\nThe ASPO offers a pessimistic view of PO from a geological standpoint [3, 10], \n\nsupporting that oil deposits are fixed and, as a consequence, stocks decrease with \n\nconsumption. It also expresses concern over decreasing production, stating that all the \n\nlargest, therefore easier to locate, reserves have already been explored and future \n\ndiscoveries will be made in smaller and more remote areas and criticizes overestimation \n\nmade by producing countries whose political and economic objectives may encourage \n\nreserve misreporting for their own benefit [2, 10]. According to these statements, the \n\neffective PO date should not be very distant [1]. \n\nThe opposing, optimistic side is represented by economists [3, 10] who disagree with the \n\ngeologists\u2019 overly pessimistic opinions. Although they don\u2019t dismiss the possibility of PO \n\nfrom ever happening, their main argument is that there is no reason to worry because \n\navailable resources are big enough and that it will only occur after several decades [16]. \n\nIt is this lack of consensus that increases speculation as to when PO will actually take \n\nplace, with time periods ranging from 2010 to 2040 [10]. Whichever the calculated date, \n\nsigns of crude oil exhaustion are becoming more evident [1] and sooner or later it will \n\ncompletely run out. \n\nBesides availability, there is also the problem of environmental impact from exploring \n\nand combusting fossil fuels, mainly CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, which are \n\nclosely related to pollution and climate change, with levels expected to rise in the future \n\n[2-5, 6-11, 19-22]. Peaking of conventional (fossil) oil also plays a role in the \n\nenvironment because scarcity of conventional reserves, which are the most accessible \n\nand whose production poses less technical challenges [2], will result in production \n\nswitching to dirtier unconventional oils (e.g. tar sands) [16] that have larger emission \n\nfootprints [2, 3] due to their extraction being capital intensive and requiring additional \n\nenergy [2]. \n\nDue to all the aforementioned reasons, attention has shifted towards development of \n\nrenewable, biodegradable, cheap, sustainable, environmental friendly, freely available in \n\nnature and efficient alternative energies [6, 19, 20]. \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n \n\nAmong several fossil fuel substitutes, biofuels, hydrogen, natural gas and synthesis gas \n\nare seen as the most sustainable [6]. Within these four, biofuels are the most \n\nenvironment-friendly choice; hence, biofuels are now being explored [6].  \n\nBiofuels are referred to liquid, gas and solid fuels predominantly generated from \n\nbiological material [6, 20, 22]. The available types of biofuels are bioethanol, renewable \n\nmethanol, biodiesel, biogas, biobutanol and biohydrogen [20] and are the answer to \n\nreducing both dependence on fossil energy and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions as \n\nwell as providing steady income for farmers [6, 23]. \n\n \n\n1.2. First, second and third generation biofuels \n\nClassification of biofuels falls under two categories: primary and secondary. The first \n\ncategory is defined by organic material that is directly combusted in its natural and non-\n\nmodified chemical form (e.g. fuelwood, wood chips and pellets, etc.), used primarily for \n\nheating, cooking and producing electricity. The second comes from processed biomass \n\nthat exists in solid, gas or liquid forms and can be used for transportation and in various \n\nindustrial processes [6, 23]. Secondary biofuels are further categorized in to first, second \n\nand third-generation biofuels [6, 23]. \n\nFirst and second generation biofuels share the same biotechnological background: \n\nconversion of carbohydrates to alcohol and/or methane gas and biodiesel production \n\nthrough fatty acid hydrolysis with methanol in the presence of a catalyst to glycerol and \n\nlong chain alkyl esters (diesel) in a transesterification reaction [24]. The difference \n\nbetween the two is the feedstock [24].  \n\nFirst-generation biofuels are derived from food crops for human consumption (rice, \n\nwheat, barley, potato wastes, sugar beets etc.) and vegetable oils (soybean oil, \n\nsunflower oil, corn oil, olive oil, palm oil, coconut oil, rapeseed oil, mustard oil, castor oil \n\netc.) [19, 22, 24, 25]. The most well-known first-generation biofuel is bioethanol [6] using \n\nsugar-cane as a common feedstock, Brazil being the main country that produces and \n\nuses it [19, 22]. Nonetheless, first-generation biofuels raise some concerns regarding its \n\nsustainability. With global population steadily increasing, more food will be required to \n\nmeet its needs. As the production capacity of first-generation biofuels increases, so does \n\ntheir conflict with food supply due to pressure on agricultural land (e.g. the intensive use \n\nof land with high fertilizer and pesticide applications and water) leading to environmental \n\nproblems, rise in costs and hunger threats from food shortages, especially in developing \n\ncountries where more than 800 million people suffer from hunger and malnutrition [6, 23, \n\n25-29]. Consequently, many agencies, particularly food and agricultural organizations \n\nand economic modelers consider the use of these biofuels as unviable [28] and efforts \n\nare being made to use non-edible biomass for the production of biofuels [6]. \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n \n\nSecond-generation biofuels emerge as a solution to the food versus fuel controversy \n\nbecause, unlike first-generation biofuels, they do not compete with food production as \n\ntheir feedstock generally comes from non-edible lignocellulosic rich materials, \n\neliminating competition with food crops [6, 22-24, 27]. Examples of different feedstocks \n\ninclude Jatropha curcas, lesquerella oil, cotton seed, Pongamia glabra, karanja and \n\nSalvadora oleoides, linseed oil, forestry residues, switch grass, wood and biomass \n\nsources [20]. Second-generation biofuels offer a number of advantages. Some feedstock \n\nspecies can be grown in largely unproductive areas and are mostly located in degraded \n\nforest and coastal areas; they are biodegradable and are 15\u201320% more efficient when \n\nmixed with petroleum diesel in different proportions without the need to modify engines \n\nand emit less carbon gases [20]. They also exhibit desirable fuel properties such as high \n\ncetane number, very high flash point, excellent lubricity and very favorable energy \n\nbalance [20]. However, second-generation biofuels cannot yet be produced \n\neconomically in a large scale, since converting the lignocellulosic biomass into \n\nfermentable sugars is a complex process [22-24]. Therefore, production of second-\n\ngeneration biofuels requires more sophisticated processing equipment, more investment \n\nper unit of production and large-scale facilities [6]. \n\nThird generation biofuels focus on microorganisms [6] as an alternative to agricultural \n\nand animal sources [30], particularly oil-accumulating microbes such as microalgae, \n\nbacteria, yeasts and other fungi [31] whose oil can be extracted and converted into \n\nbiodiesel. Biofuels from microorganisms are devoid of the major disadvantages related \n\nwith biofuels derived from plant crops [6] since their cultivation isn\u2019t dependant on \n\nseasons and climate, presenting properties similar to vegetable oil [32].  \n\nA microorganism is considered to be oleaginous if it has the capability to accumulate \n\nsignificant quantities of storage triacylglycerols (TAGs) [33] and a lipid content exceeding \n\n20% of their dry biomass weight [30, 34-36]. Lipid accumulation in these microorganisms \n\nis dependent on nitrogen availability [30]. Once this nutrient is exhausted, the excess \n\ncarbon present is assimilated by the cells and converted into TAGs during the stationary \n\nphase, when cell growth and division is halted, and lipid accumulates within existing cells \n\n[30]. \n\nThird-generation biofuels production mainly focuses on microalgae [23]. Microalgae, as \n\na feedstock for third-generation biofuels production, are inexpensive, environmentally \n\nfriendly, fully renewable, and can be used in a wide range of fuel blends such as diesel, \n\npetrol, and jet fuel and aviation gasoline [20]. Generally they have higher biomass and \n\nlipid productivities and grow faster when compared to oilseed crops [26]. Species such \n\nas Chlorella contain around 60-70% lipid content and high lipid productivity (7.4 g.L\n-1\n\n.d\n-1\n \n\nfor Chlorella protothecoides) [22], need much less land area (up to 49 or 132 times less) \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n \n\nand can have up to 100 times more oil content when compared to oilseed crops [26, 28], \n\nreaching 5000 gallons per acre, in contrast with 1000 gallons per acre from common \n\nvegetable oils. They are able to produce, theoretically, up to a yield of 20,000 gallons of \n\nfeedstock per acre of land, depending on the species [28]. The estimated market size for \n\nalgae is $425 billions, which is more than twice the expected market size for other \n\ntraditional biofuels [28]. \n\nMicroalgae can be either autotrophic or heterotrophic [23]. Autotrophism uses inorganic \n\ncarbon sources, and can be further classified according to the source of energy either in \n\nto photoautrophism (autotrophic photosynthesis) if using light or chemoautotrophism if \n\nthe energy comes from oxidized inorganic compounds. Heterotrophic microalgae require \n\nan organic carbon source to grow. Like in autotrophism, they can be categorized \n\naccording to the energy source in to photoheterotrophs or chemoheterotrophs. Some \n\nstrains can combine autotrophic photosynthesis and heterotrophic assimilation of \n\norganic compounds, called mixotrophs. [6, 23, 29, 37] \n\nAt present, most of the works aiming at microbial biodiesel production use autotrophic \n\nmicroalgae [29, 38] to limit cost of input materials [31]. Indeed they are efficient CO2 \n\nfixers, requiring considerable amounts of this greenhouse effect gas to convert it into \n\nbiomass using solar energy, they can be used as a cheaper mode of CO2 sequestration \n\nin oil and gas facilities and related industrial power plants, and are considered almost \n\ncarbon neutral [26, 28]. However, their growth is much slower than bacteria or fungi. \n\nMoreover, autotrophic cultures have low biomass and oil yields, due to limitations of light \n\nand oxygen accumulation [38], are dependent on climate, are easily contaminated by \n\nother microorganisms and require large areas and high amounts of water [31]. Thus, \n\nfuture research should be focused on heterotrophic cultivation [29]. \n\nHeterotrophic algae cultivation systems are carried out in the absence of light. \n\nTherefore, it is easy to cultivate them at large scales without depending on light \n\nrequirements [29]. Despite the additional cost from having to provide the culture with the \n\ncarbon source, heterotrophic systems easily compensate for this due to increased oil \n\ncontent and cell density in a shorter time [31]. A specific study by Liu et al [39] shows the \n\nbenefits of using heterotrophic algae for biodiesel production, with a 900% increase in \n\nlipid yield using the heterotrophic Chlorella zofingiensis compared to autotrophic \n\nconditions.  \n\nIn addition to heterotrophic microalgae, other heterotrophic oleaginous microorganisms \n\nsuch as bacteria, filamentous fungi and yeasts have been considered as potential \n\nsource oil for biodiesel production, because they can produce appreciable amounts of \n\nlipids when cultured in conventional bioreactors and under strictly controlled conditions \n\n(which reduces the risk of contaminations), reaching higher biomass and lipid yields [40].  \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n \n\nAlthough bacteria have higher growth rates and shorter growth periods than microalgae, \n\nmost of the species have lower lipid content, on average 20-40% of dry biomass [30]. \n\nHowever, only a few strains are known to synthesize lipids and, since they are stored in \n\nthe outer membrane, it is difficult to extract them efficiently [30]. For these reasons, there \n\nis currently no industrial application of bacterial feedstocks for biofuel production [30]. \n\nFor decades, oleaginous yeasts have been studied as a microbial source of oil [31]. \n\nCompared to microalgae, conventional microbial bioreactors can be used to cultivate \n\nthese microorganisms, resulting in improved biomass yield and, consequently, lesser \n\nbiomass and oil production costs [35]. \n\nOf 600 known yeast species [41], over 70 are considered oleaginous and oleaginicity \n\nscreenings are still uncovering new oil producing yeast species [31]. These species are \n\ngenerally from, but not limited to, the genera Candida, Cryptococcus, Rhodotorula, \n\nRhizopus, Trichosporon, Lipomyces, and Yarrowia and can accumulate lipids 40-70% of \n\ntheir biomass depending on the conditions in which they are grown [41]. \n\n \n\n1.3. The yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides \n\nSpecies of the genus Rhodotorula date all the way back to Fresenius in 1850 with the \n\ndescription of Cryptococcus glutinis [42]. The genus was formally described by Harrison \n\nin 1928 [43] to include red yeasts that did not produce spores while other pigmented \n\nyeasts were placed in Chromotorula, a genus that would be later rejected by Lodder in \n\n1934 [44] who attributed the genus Rhodotorula to all carotenoid producing species.  \n\nIn the first edition of the book entitled \u201cThe Yeasts, A Taxonomic Study\u201d, Rhodotorula \n\nyeasts were notable for seldom exhibiting primitive pseudomycelia, synthesizing \n\ncarotenoids and lacking fermentation [45]. Seven species were accepted in this edition. \n\nSupplementary descriptions were made in the second edition published in 1970, adding \n\nRhodotorula\u2019s inability to assimilate inositol and to synthesize starch-like compounds \n\n[46]. Nine species were recorded in the genus.  \n\nBy this time, studies on the sexuality of Rhodotorula confirmed its basidiomycetous \n\nnature. Investigations by Banno, I. led to the observation that, in Rhodotorula, \n\nconjugation of haploid cells gave rise to a mycelial stage presenting a dikaryotic \n\nmycelium with clamp-connections, indicating a correspondence to a secondary \n\nmycelium of Basidiomycetes, concluding that the Rhodotorula yeasts capable of mating \n\nare simply the haploid stage of a basidiomycetous fungus [47, 48]. The perfect name \n\ngiven to the two sexually compatible strains of Rhodotorula glutinis which Banno studied \n\nis Rhodosporidium toruloides Banno, the type species of the genus [49]. \n\nThis major finding changed the definition of the genus Candida. Ascomycetous species \n\nwere retained in this genus while the basidiomycetous species were separated based on \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n \n\nthe composition of cell hydrolyzates [50]. Species with xylose in the cell hydrolyzates \n\nwere placed in Cryptococcus and those which lacked xylose were transferred to \n\nRhodotorula [50]. \n\nThe Rhodotorula genus, as currently defined, includes 34 species that comprise a \n\npolyphyletic group of organisms. Cultures have a coral pink color, are smooth and moist \n\nto mucoid, with variable growth at 37\u00baC with a diameter between three to five \n\nmicrometers and grow as ellipsoid, multipolar budding yeast [51]. \n\nRhodotorula glutinis is one of the 34 species, classified taxonomically in the super-\n\nkingdom Eukaria, kingdom Fungi, sub-kingdom Dikaria, phylum Basidiomycota, sub-\n\nphylum Puciniomycotina, class Microbotriomycetes, order Sporidiobolales and genus \n\nRhodotorula [52]. No family has yet been assigned [53].  \n\nCompared to algae, fungi and bacteria, Rhodotorula glutinis exhibits higher growth rate \n\nand can accumulate lipids under low-cost substrates [32]. \n\nRhodosporidium toruloides NCYC 921 is an anamorph of this yeast [54, 55].  \n\n \n\n1.4. Carotenoids \n\nCarotenoids are isoprenoids containing a characteristic polyene chain of conjugated \n\ndouble bonds and are either acyclic or cyclic with one or two cyclic end groups [56]. \n\nThere is a great variety of carotenoids, with more than 600 different compounds [56-60].  \n\nCarotenoids are important in nature as they confer color to plants and animals \n\nspecifically birds, insects, fish, and crustaceans [57]. The coloration of flamingoes and \n\nsalmon is a common example of pigmentation from the presence of the carotenoid \n\nastaxanthin [59]. Other carotenoids can also give purple, crimson and burgundy colors to \n\nfeathers of some birds [59].  \n\nCarotenoid synthesis is present in plants, bacteria, fungi, and algae [57]. Animals lack \n\nthis ability, and are therefore only able to incorporate them from their diet [57]. Of all the \n\nexisting carotenoids, about 40 are found in the human diet and less than half of these \n\nare known to be present in humans [61], with 90% of the carotenoids in the diet and \n\nhuman body represented by ?-carotene, ?-carotene, lycopene, lutein and cryptoxanthin \n\n[58, 60].  \n\nIntake comes primarily from fruits and vegetables [62]. Yellow and orange fruits and \n\nvegetables and green leafy vegetables contain ?-carotene whilst ?-carotene is mainly \n\nfound in carrots. Tomatoes and tomato based foods account for over 85% of all dieta ry \n\nsources of lycopene; spinach and kale are a source of high levels of lutein and \n\nzeaxanthin; orange fruits, such as tangerine and papaya, have large amounts of ?-\n\ncryptoxanthin [58, 62]. Additionally, smaller carotenoid amounts can be obtained from \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n \n\ndairy products, egg yolks, and ocean fish and in colorants added to processed foods \n\n[58].  \n\nIncreasing commercial interest of carotenoids is connected to their potential benefits in \n\nhuman and animal health [63]. Carotenoids are seen as biomarkers, as they have the \n\npotential to give an accurate estimate of a person\u2019s overall health [59]. Many clinical \n\ntrials show a positive association between dietary carotenoids and decreased risk of \n\nseveral disorders such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, age-related progressive eye \n\nloss and cognitive decline [57-65] due to their physiological functions such serving as \n\nvitamin A precursors and antioxidants [57-66].  \n\nCarotenoids are currently used in feed, pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries and \n\nhave high commercial value with a global market accounted for 766 million dollars \n\nexpected to increase by 155 million dollars in the current year [67] \n\nDespite the availability of a variety of natural and synthetic carotenoids, microbial \n\nsources of carotenoids have received increasing attention because of the restricted rules \n\nand regulations currently applied to chemically synthesized/purified pigments [65]. \n\nAmong these sources, Rhodotorula sp. is a well known carotenoid producer [63, 65]. \n\nThe 4 main carotenoids produced by this species are torularhodin, torulene, ?-carotene \n\nand ?-carotene [68] (Figure 1). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Chemical structure of ?-carotene, ?-carotene, torularhodin and torulene, the 4 main \ncarotenoids produced by Rhodotorula sp. (Adapted from Molin\u00e9 et al. [68]). \n\nYeasts are better suited than algae or molds for large-scale carotenoid production in \n\nfermenters, due to their unicellular nature and high growth rate [63]. Besides, yeasts can \n\nadapt to different environmental conditions and grow under a wide variety of carbon and \n\nnitrogen sources [68]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n \n\n1.5. Sustainable production of biodiesel from Rhodosporidium toruloides \n\nCurrently, the production of biodiesel from microorganisms is not economically feasible \n\nbecause it is an expensive process compared to first generation fuels [54].  \n\nHowever, Rhodosporidium toruloides biomass has a high lipid content and is also rich in \n\nhigh-value added products such as carotenoids (section 1.4.). The co-extraction and \n\ncommercialization of these two products may help reduce the overall process cost [54, \n\n55]. \n\n \n\n2. Scope of present study \n\nThis work's main objective was to optimize production of lipids and carotenoids by the \n\noleaginous yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides NCYC 921 using a bench bioreactor \n\noperating in a fed-batch regime, with glucose as the carbon source. Different medium pH \n\nchanges strategies were used in order to improve lipids and carotenoids production. \n\nFlow cytometry (FC) was used to monitor, in real time, various cell parameters such as \n\ntotal carotenoids (TC) content and cell viability.  \n\nOn a personal level, this work was conducted as part of a master's thesis in order to \n\nassimilate the maximum of experimental techniques and as much knowledge possible. \n\n \n\n3. Materials and methods \n\n3.1. Reagents and equipment \n\nThe list of all reagents used throughout the whole experimental work can be found in \n\ntable A1 (see annex I.). All equipment will be mentioned along this section. \n\n \n\n3.2. Microorganism \n\nThe strain used was Rhodosporium toruloides NCYC 921, supplied by the National \n\nCollection of Yeast Cultures (Norwich, United Kingdom).  \n\nYeast cells were kept in Malt Extract Agar (MEA) (in g.L\n-1\n\n: agar, 15; malt extract, 30; \n\nmycological peptone, 5) slants at 4\u00baC until needed. \n\n \n\n3.3. Pre-inoculum preparation \n\nPre-cultures were prepared by transferring R.toruloides cells from two MEA slants at \n\n30\u00baC for 72 h to 1 L baffled flasks containing 150 mL of sterilized growth medium. The \n\nglucose solution (35 g.L\n-1\n\n) was sterilized separately and mixed aseptically.  \n\nMedium pH was adjusted to 4 before transferring the yeast cells. Shaken incubation was \n\nperformed at 30\u00baC at 150 rpm (Unitrom Infors, Switzerland) for 24 hours (exponential \n\ngrowth phase).  \n\nAll pre-cultures were performed in duplicate to account for any possible contamination. \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n3.4. Bioreactor growth medium \n\nThe growth medium described by Pan et al (1986) was used [69]. Compositions are as \n\nfollows: \n\nTable 1. Composition of the growth medium (values in g.L\n-1\n\n) \n\nCulture medium g\u00b7L\n-1\n\n \n\nKH2PO4 12.5 \nNa2HSO4 1.0 \n(NH4)2SO4 5.0 \n\nMgSO4.7H2O 2.5 \nCaCl2.2H2O 0.25 \n\nYeast Extract (YE) 1.9 \nGlucose 35 \n\nTrace Minerals - \n\n \n\n Table 2. Composition of trace minerals used in the growth medium (values in g.L\n-1\n\n) \n\n \n\n3.5.  Fermentation in a bioreactor \n\nFed-batch microbial cultivation trials were carried out in a fermenter (Electrolab Fermac \n\n310/60 bioreactor, United Kingdom) with a 5 L working volume (total volume 7 L). The \n\nvessel initially contained 2.85 L of concentrated cultivation media with a salt \n\nconcentration for 5 L, and 35 g.L\n-1\n\n glucose with 1.25 mL trace minerals.  \n\nTemperature control was achieved using a PT100 sensor to measure vessel \n\ntemperature and a low voltage (24 V) control wrap-around heating system with a cold \n\nfinger heat exchange for cooling.  \n\nThe pH was monitored by an autoclavable pH electrode and adjusted by automatic \n\naddition of 5 M HCl or 5 M NaOH using two separate peristaltic pumps (Watson Marlow).  \n\nDissolved oxygen (DO) was monitored by an autoclavable polarographic DO electrode, \n\ncontrolled by stirrer speed, air flow, or combination of both.  \n\nPolypropylene glycol (PPG) was used as an anti-foaming agent, added by an automatic \n\nperistaltic pump, controlled by a conductivity probe.  \n\nTrace Minerals (0.25 mL.L\n-1\n\n) g\u00b7L\n-1\n\n (in 5N-HCL) \n\nFeSO4.7H2O 40 \nCaCl2.2H2O 40 \n\nMnSO4.7H2O 10 \nAlCl3.6H20 10 \n\nCoCl2 4 \nZnSO4.7H2O 2 \n\nNa2MoO4.2H2O 2 \nCuCl2.2H2O 1 \n\nH3BO4 0.5 \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n \n\nThe feeding strategy consisted of two distinct steps. In an initial phase, after a previous \n\nbatch culture, a nutrient solution (in g.L\n-1\n\n: MgSO4.7H2O, 9; Yeast Extract, 20; Glucose, \n\n600) was supplied to the yeast to extend its exponential phase. Secondly, once the \n\nyeast reached the stationary phase, the feeding solution was replaced by 600 g.L\n-1\n \n\nconcentrated glucose solution\n \nto induce the synthesis of intracellular storage materials \n\nsuch as lipids and carotenoids.  \n\nFermentations lasted a week on average, and three samples were collected per day. For \n\neach sample, several parameters were analyzed including the estimation of the residual \n\nglucose concentration, by means of a qualitative test using Combur-Test\n\u00ae \n\nstrips, pH \n\nvalue (Consor C3021, Belgium) and absorbency at 600 nm (ThermoSpectronic Genesys \n\n20). The first and last samples collected per day were also analysed by flow cytometry to \n\nevaluate at-line cell viability (section 3.8.1) and carotenoid content (section 3.8.2).  \n\nThe contents of the three samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 9000 rpm at 5\u00baC \n\n(Avanti J-25 I Centrifuge Beckman, USA) and the supernatant stored at -18 \u00b0 C for \n\nfurther analysis of residual glucose (section 3.6.2) and nitrogen (section 3.6.3). The \n\nbiomass (pellet) was also stored at -18 \u00b0 C for further analysis of fatty acids (section \n\n3.6.4) and total lipids (section 3.6.5). \n\n \n\n3.6. Analytical Methods \n\n3.6.1. Biomass quantification \n\nBiomass was measured by optical density (OD) at 600 nm wavelength in a \n\nspectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic\n\u00ae\n Genesys 20, Portugal).  \n\nA linear regression was used to establish the correlation between OD and dry cell weight \n\n(DCW). This correlation is expressed by the equation: OD600 nm = 0.7062 [biomass] + \n\n0.4338 (R\n2\n = 0.9986). \n\n \n\n3.6.2. Residual glucose concentration \n\nResidual reducing sugar concentration was determined by the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid \n\n(DNS) method [70].  \n\nFrom a glucose stock solution (1.5 g.L\n-1\n\n), six standard solutions were made by \n\nperforming serial dilutions, in distilled water, with concentrations ranging from 1.5 g/L to \n\n0.75 g/L with a 10 mL final volume (10, 8, 5, 1, 0.5, 0)  in order to establish a calibration \n\ncurve to determine the glucose concentration in the samples. Supernatant samples were \n\ndiluted appropriately so that absorvance values would not deviate from those registered \n\nin the calibration curve.  \n\nTo a 0.5 mL sample volume, 0.5 mL DNS reagent [5g DNS, 8g NaOH and 150g \n\npotassium sodium tartarate (KNaC4H4O6\u00b74H2O), in 500 mL distilled water] was added. The \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n \n\nmixture was vortexed fo 5 seconds, sealed and placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min, \n\nfollowed by 5 min in an ice bath to stop the reaction. The mixture was diluted in distilled \n\nwater (5 mL) and vortexed once more. Sugar concentration was determined according to \n\nsamples' spectrophotometrical readings at a 550 nm wavelength. Standard solutions and \n\nsamples were analysed in duplicate and triplicate, respectively. \n\n \n\n3.6.3. Nitrogen quantification \n\nQuantification of total nitrogen was done according to the classical Kjeldahl method [71].  \n\nSupernatant samples (5 mL) were weighed in Kjeldahl digestion tubes with a 800 mL \n\ncapacity. Conversion of amino nitrogen of organic components present in the samples \n\ninto ammonium sulphate occured for 2 to 3 hours in the presence of 12 M H 2SO4 and a \n\ncatalyst [30g copper sulfate (CuSO4), 30g titanium dioxide (TiO2), 10g stearic acid \n\n(C18H36O2) and 930 g potassium sulfate (K2SO4)] until samples became pale green, \n\nindicating complete digestion.  \n\nAmmonia was distilled from an alkaline solution (NaOH 50%) and absorbed in a 4% \n\nH3BO3 solution containing two drops of pH indicator (2g methyl red and 1g methylene \n\nblue in 100 mL 95% (v/v) ethanol).  \n\nAmmonia content was determined by titration with 0.1 N HCl, with the indicator's colour \n\nshifting from green to violet once the pH reached 4.8. Total nitrogen percentage in each \n\nsample is given by the following equation: \n\nEquation 1 - Nitrogen content, given in percentage (nitrogen mass / 100 mL sample).  V = \n\nVolume in mL 0.1 N HCl used in sample titration. m = sample mass expressed in grams. \n\n \n\n3.6.4. Derivatization and identification of fatty acids \n\nFatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were obtained according to the method described by \n\nLepage and Roy (1986) [72], modified by Cohen et al (1988) [73]. \n\nTransesterification was accomplished by adding 2 mL methanol/acetyl chloride (95:5, \n\nv/v) and 0.2 mL internal standard [heptadecanoic acid, 17:0 (5 mg.mL\n-1\n\n, Nu-Check-Prep, \n\nElysian, USA) to 0.1 g freeze-dryed (Heto\n\u00ae\n PowerDry LL3000 Freeze Dryer with \n\nVacuubrand\n\u00ae\n vacuum pump) yeast biomass. The mixture was sealed under a saturated \n\nnitrogen atmosphere and heated at 80\u00baC for 1 h, protected from light.  \n\nAfter cooling to room temperature, samples were diluted with 1 mL water to facilitate \n\nphase formation. Extraction was made with 1 mL n-heptane. The heptanoic (upper) \n\nphase was filtered through a cotton and anydrous sodium sulphate filter and collected \n\ninto light-protected teflon-lined vials under nitrogen atmosphere. Analysis was performed \n\nN =\n0.14V\n\nm\n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n \n\nin a gas chromatograph (SCION GC 436 with Kombi Moisture/HydroCarbon Filter \n\nhelium, air and hydrogen filters also from Bruker, Germany) equipped with a flame \n\nionization detector (FID). Separation of the compounds was carried out on a 30 m long \n\nSupelcowax 10 (Supelco) capillary column with a 0.32 mm internal diameter and 0.25 \n\nmm film thickness. The initial column temperature was programmed to 200\u00baC for 20 min \n\nuntil it reached a final temperature of 220\u00baC. Injector and detector temperatures were \n\n250\u00baC and 280\u00baC, respectively. Helium gas was used as carrier at a flow rate of 1.3 \n\nml/mL. Methyl esters were identified by comparison of retention times of the standard \n\ncomponents 461 (Nu-Chek-Prep, Elysian, MN, USA).  \n\nExtractions were performed in duplicate and injected twice. Quantification of individual \n\nfatty acids was done in accordance with the following equation: \n\nEquation 2 - Quantification of fatty acids. mFA = amount of fatty acid; AFA = fatty acid peak area; \n\nAIS = area of the peak corresponding to the internal standard (17:0); RFFA = fatty acid response \n\nfactor (RF = 1 for all fatty acids). \n\n \n\n3.6.5. Total lipids extraction \n\nThe protocol chosen for evaluation of total yeast lipid content was adapted from a \n\nstandard method for determination of oil content in oleaginous seeds [74].  \n\nFreeze-dryed R. toruloides cells were broken in a ball mill (Retsch\n\u00ae\n MM 400 ball mill) set \n\nto its maximum vibrational frequency for 3.5 min using 10 cm diameter metal spheres. \n\nThis process was facilitated by previously grinding and crushing the dry biomass using a \n\nmortar and pestle.  \n\nOne gram of ruptured cells was weighed into a porous cellulose thimble, which was then \n\ntightly packed and loaded into a Soxhlet apparatus. Continuous extraction lasted for a \n\ntotal of 9 hours, with hexane (100 mL) as the organic solvent.  \n\nThe solvent containing the oils (noticeable by its bright orange colour) was collected  into \n\ntared (sonicated for 15 min in regular tap water, then thoroughly washed with deionized \n\nwater, ethanol and acetone prior to being placed in an oven at 100\u00baC for 16 hours) round \n\nbase flasks. The deoiled biomass left inside the thimble was stored at -20\u00baC. Oil extracts \n\nthat were cloudy, due to some solid particles that managed to be dragged along with the \n\nsolvent, were filtered through a membrane filter. Dry extracts were obtained removing \n\nthe organic solvent by vacuum using a Rotavapor. All extractions were performed in \n\nduplicate.  \n\n \n\n \n\nm FA=\nAFA\n\nAIS\nx RFFA\n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n \n\n3.6.6. Carotenoids extraction \n\nFreeze-dryed yeast biomass was ground in ball mill for 3 min at a frequency of 25 Hz \n\nusing 5 cm diameter metal spheres. A quantity of 0.150 g was suspended in 2 mL \n\nDMSO in tin foil covered plastic test tubes (to prevent carotenoid degradation by \n\nexposure to light) containing acid-washed 425-600 \u00b5m glass beads (Sigma-Aldrich\n\u00ae\n). \n\nThe suspension was stirred in a vortex mixer for 1 min and placed in a water bath at \n\n55\u00baC for 1 h, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 3900 rpm. These steps were \n\nrepeated once and the supernatants transferred to a separatory funnel.  \n\nThe pellet was ressuspended in 2 mL acetone and the extraction was carried out in the \n\nsame way as with DMSO, and repeated several times until the pellet lost all its pigments \n\nand the acetone became colorless.  \n\nThe acetone extract was mixed with the DMSO fraction and serial washed with 2 mL \n\n20% NaCl solution at 5\u00b0C, 5 mL hexane or petroleum ether and 5-10 mL distilled water \n\nat 5\u00baC. The immiscible solvent mixture was vigorously shaken for about 30 seconds, \n\nreleasing occasional accumulated vapor pressure inside the separation funnel until the \n\ncolored (upper) phase became translucid. The two immiscible layers were then left to sit, \n\nafter which the aqueous (bottom) phase was discarded and the organic fraction collected \n\ninto a glass flask and evaporated under vacuum using a rotavapor (Buchi\n\u00ae\n R-200 \n\nRotavapor with a R-490 Heating Bath and V-800 vacuum controller).  \n\nThe dry extract was ressuspended in hexane and passed through cotton and anhydrous \n\nsodium sulfate in order to remove traces of water then evaporated under a gentle stream \n\nof nitrogen and resuspended in 3 mL filtered acetone.  This step was performed twice. \n\n \n\na) Quantification by UV-VIS spectrophotometry \n\nAbsorption spectra of extracts were obtained in the visible radiation range (380-700 nm) \n\nusing a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2401PC UV-VIS recording \n\nspectrophotometer).  \n\nTC were calculated by the Beer-Lambert law using an extinction coefficient \n\ncorresponding to that of beta-carotene in acetone at a wavelength of 450 nm [? = 2630 l / \n\n(10g.cm)].  \n\n \n\nb) Identification and quantification by HPLC \n\nHPLC with a UV-VIS detector set to 450 nm was used to analyze the extracts. The \n\nsystem used consisted of a ?-Bondapack C18 reversed phase (250 x 4.0 mm) column \n\nwith methanol [0.1% triethylamine (TEA)]: acetonitrile: ethyl acetate (75:15:10) as the \n\nmobile phase. Samples were eluted for 12 min at a flow rate of 0.8 mL.min\n-1\n\n. Beta-\n\ncarotene was identified by comparing retention times of the carotenoid in the sample \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n \n\nwith the retention time of the standard (Sigma\n \n97% ?-carotene, United Kingdom). \n\nStandard solutions of ?-carotene, with concentrations ranging from 0.06 to 6.5 ?g.mL\n-1\n\n, \n\nwere used for the calibration curve (total ?-carotene content (?g.mL-1) = Area x 0.003 + \n\n0.0022) which was used to determine the total content of ?-carotene. The identification \n\nof other carotenoids (torulene and torularhodin) was made by comparison of the \n\nchromatograms obtained with those reported in the literature for a similar system. \n\n \n\n3.7. Kinetic Parameters \n\nIn order to characterize growth, lipid and carotenoid production of R.toruloides, several \n\nkinetic parameters were calculated. \n\n \n\n3.7.1. Biomass productivity \n\nBiomass productivity was calculated using the following equation: \n\n    \n     \n\n     \n \n\nEquation 3 - Biomass productivity [PX (gbiomass.L\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n)] in relation with t = 0h. Xi (g.L\n-1\n\n)= biomass \nconcentration at t = i; X0 (g.L\n\n-1\n)= biomass concentration at t = 0h; ti = time at i (h); t0 = initial time \n\n(t = 0h) \n\n \n\n3.7.2. Total fatty acid productivity and percentage \n\nTotal fatty acid productivity and percentage were calculated using the following \n\nequations, respectively: \n\n         \n                    \n\n   \n \n\nEquation 4 - Total fatty acid productivity [PTFA (gTFA.L\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n)]. PX = biomass productivity (gbiomass.L\n-\n\n1\n.h\n\n-1\n); %TFA (wTFA/wbiomass) = percentage of Total Fatty Acids in relation to the biomass. \n\nThe %TFA was calculated according to the following equation: \n\n                    \n   \n\n       \n     \n\nEquation 5 \u2013 Total fatty acid percentage [%TFA (wtfa/wbiomass)]; mFA = total fatty acid amount \n(mg); msample = yeast biomass amount (mg). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n \n\n3.7.3. Fatty acid composition \n\nFatty acid composition was calculated according to the following equation: \n\n                \n    \n\n    \n     \n\nEquation 6 \u2013 Percentage of each fatty acid in total fatty acid weight. %FAi (Pfa/Ptfa) = percentage \nof fatty acid i; mFAi = fatty acid i weight (mg); mTFA = total fatty acid weight (mg), calculated by \nthe sum of all fatty acids weights. \n\n \n\n3.7.4. Total carotenoid productivity \n\nTC productivity was calculated using the following equation: \n\n             \n\nEquation 7 - TC productivity [PTC (mgtc.L\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n)]. Px = biomass productivity (gbiomass.L\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n); CTC \n= TC concentration (mgcarotenoids.gbiomass\n\n-1\n). \n\n \n\n3.8. Flow Cytometry \n\nA flow cytometer (FACScalibur, Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) equipped \n\nwith an argon laser emitting at 488 nm and photomultipliers FL1 (530 \u00b1 30 nm), FL2 (585 \n\n\u00b1 42 nm), FL3 (> 670 nm) and FL4 (600 \u00b1 16 nm) was used to monitor the cytoplasmic \n\nmembrane integrity, mitochondrial and cytoplasmic membrane potentials, enzymatic \n\nactivity and to quantify TC content in R. toruloides cells throughout the cultivations.  \n\n \n\n3.8.1.  Plasma membrane integrity and mitochondrial potential \n\nCytoplasmic membrane integrity and potential were simultaneously monitored by \n\nfluorescence emitted by yeast cells double stained with the fluorochromes propidium \n\niodide (PI) (Invitrogen, USA) and 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide [DiOC6(3)] \n\n(Invitrogen, USA), respectively. \n\nPI is excluded by viable cells [75], as the stain passes through only damaged cell \n\nmembranes, intercalating with the nucleic acids of injured and dead cells to form a bright \n\nred fluorescent complex [76, 77]. PI is excited at 536 nm and emits at 623 nm, so the \n\nfluorescence of cells stained with this fluorochrome can be detected both in FL2 and FL3 \n\nchannels [40]. DiOC6(3) is a positively charged lipophilic carbocyanine stain that \n\naccumulates intracellularly in polarized or hyperpolarized cytoplasmic and mitochondrial \n\nmembranes [54]. DiOC6(3) is excited at 484 nm and the fluorescence of the stained cells \n\nis measured at 501 nm may be detected in the FL1 channel [40].  \n\nStock PI solution concentration was 1 mg.mL\n-1\n\n (in filtered milli-Q water) and  \n\nfinal solution concentration in the cell suspension was 0.5 ?g.mL\n-1\n\n. DiOC6 (3) stock \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n \n\nsolution concentration was 10 ng.mL\n-1 \n\nin DMSO, and the final solution concentration was \n\n5 ng\u00b7mL\n-1\n\n.  \n\nSamples taken throughout the trials were sonicated (Transsonic T 660/H, Elma, \n\nGermany) for 10 seconds to avoid cell aggregation, and diluted in phosphate buffer \n\nsaline [PBS, pH 7.3 \u00b1 0.2 (Oxoid, England)] in order to obtain about 800 to 1,000 events \n\nper second. Next, 0.5 ?L DiOC6(3) were added to 499 ?L diluted sample. The mixture \n\nwas incubated in the dark at room temperature for 5 min, after which 0.5 ?L IP were \n\nadded and cells analysed immediately.  \n\nAll buffers and Mili-Q water were filtered through 0.2 \u00b5m membrane filters (TPP Syringe \n\nfilter 22, Switzerland and White nitrocellulose membrane filters, Filtres Fioroni, France, \n\nfor buffer solutions and Mili-Q water, respectively) \n\nData obtained by multiparametric FC was analyzed in FCS Express 4 Flow Research \n\nEdition program.  \n\n \n\n3.8.2. At-line TC analysis \n\nTC content was determined by measuring the autofluorescence of the yeast cells. To \n\nthis end, we previously established a correlation between the autofluorescence of yeast \n\ncells read in the FL1, FL2 and FL3 channels and TC quantified by HPLC for the same \n\nsamples. Since the content of carotenoids increases with the aging of the culture [54], \n\nthe correlation was established by analyzing samples taken at different phases of cell \n\ngrowth. Thus, it is possible to correlate autofluorescence readings obtained by FC with \n\nthe TC content through a linear regression [54]. \n\nThe samples were sonicated (T Transsonic 660 / H, Elma, Germany) for 10 seconds to \n\nremove any cell aggregates and ensure individual analysis of cells. Next, the samples \n\nwere diluted in phosphate buffer saline [PBS, pH 7.3 \u00b1 0.2 (Oxoid, England)] in order to \n\nobtain between 800 and 1,000 events per second. Autofluorescence was then read for \n\nquantification of TC. \n\nFor the first sample, collected at the beginning of yeast growth, autofluorescence in the \n\nFL1, FL2 and FL3 channels was adjusted at the first logarithmic decade. This setting \n\nwas used for subsequent readings made throughout the trials. \n\n \n\n4. Results and discussion \n\n4.1. Carotenoid quantification by HPLC \n\nAccording to Freitas et al. (2014), the yeast cells autofluorescence can be used for at \n\nline detection of carotenoid content in yeasts, using FC [54]. However, the correlation \n\ndescribed in that work, where R. toruloides NCYC 921 was cultivated in shake flasks, \n\ncould not be used in the present work, because it was found that the biomass produced \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n \n\nin our bench bioreactor had a carotenoid composition different from the one observed in \n\nshake flasks. As a result, the yeast cells emitted fluorescence at different wave lengths \n\nwhen cultivated in different systems. Therefore, it was necessary to establish a new \n\ncorrelation between the TC content determined by the conventional method (extraction, \n\nand quantification of these compounds by HPLC), and the autofluorescence of cells \n\nmeasured by FC (see sections 3.6.6.and 3.8.2.). \n\nFigure 2 shows the TC content and individual carotenoids (?-carotene, torulene, \n\ntorularhodin) in mgcarotenoids.gdry cell wieght\n-1\n\n, determined by HPLC analysis of samples taken \n\nduring assay I. Figure 3 displays the composition of carotenoids, in percentage. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.

Carotenoid composition (percentage) in R.toruloides NCYC 921 biomass collected \nthroughout assay I (section 4.2.1).  \n \n\nThrough the analysis of Figures 2 and 3, it can be concluded that torulene was always \n\nthe carotenoid produced in greater amounts, reaching a maximum of 59.00% of TC \n\ncontent (corresponding to 0.31 mg.g\n-1\n\n). The percentage of ?-carotene decreased during \n\nthe assay. Initially, the yeast biomass contained 40.34% (5x10\n-4\n\n mg.g\n-1\n\n) of ?-carotene of \n\nTC content, and at the end reaches and stabilizes at 14.50% (0.08 mg.g\n-1\n\n). Torularhodin \n\npercentage increased, reaching a maximum at t = 43 h with 31.95% (0.02 mg.g\n-1\n\n) and \n\ndecreases slightly to the end of the test, ending at 25.55% (0.13 mg.g\n-1\n\n). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n \n\n4.1.1. Autofluorescence measured by FC \n\nThe autofluorescence of R. toruloides cells detected in FL1, FL2 and FL3 channels show \n\nsimilar profiles, with higher autofluorescence values observed in the FL2 channel, as is \n\nevident in Figure 4. \n\n \n\nFigure 4. Autofluorescence of R. toruloides cells detected in FL1, FL2 and FL3 channels, \nthroughout assay I (section 4.2.1). \n\n \n\n4.1.2. Correlation between autofluorescence and TC \n\nCorrelations were calculated for each autofluorescence measured in FL1, FL2 and FL3 \n\nchannels versus TC content. The best correlation was found for TC content versus \n\nautofluorescence detected in the FL2 channel (Figure 5). \n\n \n\nFigure 5. Correlation for the TC content in mg.g\n-1\n\n assessed by HPLC, versus the yeast cells \nautofluorescence detected in the FL2 channel, determined from samples taken during the r assay \nI (section 4.2.1). \n\nThis correlation was used to convert the autofluorescence readings of R. toruloides cells \n\nduring the time course of the fed-batch cultivations, to determine TC content for all \n\nassays. \n\n \n\n4.2. Yeast fed-batch cultivations \n\nAll assays were performed in a bench reactor, operated in fed-batch mode, with the \n\nobjective of maximizing yeast cell growth and lipids and carotenoids accumulation. \n\nThe conditions used are summarized in table 3. \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n \n\nTable 3.

Solution G was added from t = 51.50 h onwards. \n\nThe culture reached the stationary phase 51.00 h after inoculation, with a biomass \n\nconcentration of 61.87 g L\n-1\n\n corresponding to 87 OD, and a biomass productivity of 1.20 \n\ng.L\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n (Figure 6a). \n\nThe maximum biomass concentration corresponded to 97.18 g.L\n-1\n\n obtained at t = 97 h, \n\nwith a biomass productivity of 0.99 gL\n-1\n.h\n\n-1\n and 137 optical density (OD). The highest \n\nbiomass productivity was reached at 50.00 h (1.58 gL\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n) with a biomass concentration \n\nof 79.76 g.L\n-1\n\n (Figure 6a). \n\nDuring yeast growth, DO was maintained at values higher than 40% (Figure 6f) in order \n\nto avoid growth limitations due to oxygen deficiency. DO values decreased from 100% to \n\nclose to 40%, when it rose again close to 87% due to depletion of the carbon source. \n\nDuring the addition of solution NG, DO dropped to values close to 50%, indicative of \n\ncellular metabolic activity. Once solution G was added, DO values remained around \n\n65%. During addition of solution G, there was an increase in TC and fatty acid \n\nproduction, although the TC content increase occurred later than the fatty acid content \n\nincrease (Figures 6b and 6c). \n\nStirring rate was maintained at 600 rpm throughout the trial (Figure 6f). \n\nResidual nitrogen levels decreased from 2.65 g.L\n-1\n to values close to zero up to t = 20.00 \n\nh and remained below 0.2 g.L\n-1\n\n throughout the addition of solutions NG and G (t > 19.67 \n\nh) (Figure 6e). \n\nIn this assay, the profile of residual glucose followed the same trend of the residual \n\nnitrogen profile, although the glucose concentration increased at the end of the test \n\n(Figure 6e) suggesting that, at the time, the metabolic activity of the cells diminished due \n\nto exhaustion of a nutrient other than nitrogen, as the cells maintain their activity when \n\nthis nutrient is not present. The feed rates of the NG and G solutions were adjusted to \n\nmaintain the residual glucose levels below 40 g.L\n-1\n\n in order to avoid yeast growth \n\ninhibition by the substrate and, at the same time, avoiding the lack of carbon in the cells. \n\nProduction of fatty acids followed the biomass profile, peaking at the beginning of the \n\nstationary phase and decreasing at the end of the test, at 167.00 h (Figure 6c). The \n\nmaximum fatty acid percentage was obtained at 74.00 h corresponding to 27.57% (w/w) \n\nin relation to the dry cell weight. The maximum fatty acids productivity was obtained at \n\n74.00 h, with a value of 0.34 g.L\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n, decreasing until the end of the experiment as a \n\nresult of the decrease in the fatty acid content and biomass productivity during stationary \n\nphase (Figures 6a and 6c). \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n \n\nCarotenoids synthesis began during the stationary phase, when solution G was added to \n\nthe culture (t = 51.50 h) supplying the carbon necessary for the production of storage \n\nmaterials, since the glucose medium was exhausted before this addition. TC content and \n\nproductivity reached their maximums at t = 144.00 h with 0.28 mg.g\n-1\n\n and 0.191 mg.L\n-1\n\n.h\n-\n\n1\n, respectively. (Figure 6b). \n\nFigure 7 shows the fatty acid composition obtained during this assay. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7. R. toruloides Fatty acid composition during assay I, at pH 5.5. The data represent the \nmean of four determinations (two independent samples injected twice) with a standard deviation \nlower than 10% (n = 4). \nB = batch phase; FB = fed-batch phase; NG = nutrients with glucose solution; G = concentrated \n(600 g.L\n\n-1\n) glucose solution. \n\n \n\nThe dominant fatty acids were oleic (18:1?9), palmitic (16:0), linoleic (18:2?6) and \n\nstearic (18:0) acids. The proportions of these fatty acids are in the range of those \n\npublished by Sawangkeaw et al. (2013) [78]  for the same yeast with the exception of \n\npalmitic acid (16:0), which presents with higher percentages (16:0: 13-16%; 18:0: 4-41% \n\n, 18:1?9: 18-42% and 18:2?6: 15-29%). \n\nAt the end of the cultivation (t = 163.00 h), oleic acid (18:1?9) was in larger quantity with \n\n31.48% of the total fatty acid content, followed by linoleic (18:2?6), palmitic (16:0) and \n\nstearic (18:0), with values of 27.48%, 26.40% and 6.62%, respectively. After the addition \n\nof solution G (t = 51.50 h), the percentages of oleic acid (18:1?9), palmitic acid (16:0) \n\nand stearic acid (18:0) decreased slightly until the end of the experiment (from 34.33% \n\nto 31.48%, from 28.95% to 26.40% and from 8.45% to 6.62%, respectively), whereas the \n\npercentage of linoleic acid (18:2?6) increased from 21.59 % to 27.97%. \n\nMyristic acid (14:0) varied between 0 and 1.57% throughout the experiment and linolenic \n\nacid (18:3?3) between 4.32% and 11.41%. Palmitoleic acid (16:1?9) acid was detected \n\nin smaller quantities only at 74.00 h with a total content of 0.70%. \n\nAccording to the European standard EN 14214 (European Standard that describes the \n\nrequirements and test methods for biodiesel) [79], due to linolenic (18:3?3)  acid\u2019s \n\npropensity to oxidize [80] its presence is restricted to percentages below 12% and \n\n  B    NG \n\n   FB \n\n G \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n \n\nmaximum polyunsaturated fatty acids with four or more double bonds are limited to 1%. \n\nThe results displayed in Figure 7 show that the R. toruloides fatty acid composition \n\nmeets the European standard requirements. \n\nFigure 8 shows the percentage of saturated fatty acids (SFA) monounsaturated fatty \n\nacids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) throughout this assay. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8.

Solution G was added to the \n\nbioreactor at t = 52.58 h. \n\nThe culture entered the stationary phase at t = 52.50 h with a biomass concentration of \n\n69.64 g.L\n-1\n\n corresponding to 98 OD and a biomass productivity of 1.31 g.L\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n (Figure \n\n9a). \n\nThe maximum biomass concentration was 119.61 g.L\n-1\n\n at t = 96.5 h with a biomass \n\nproductivity of 1.23 g.L\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n and 168.8 OD (Figure 9a). \n\nThe maximum biomass productivity was reached at t = 47.00 h (1.76 g.L\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n) with a \n\nbiomass concentration of 83.48 g.L\n-1\n\n (Figure 9a). \n\nAs expected, changing the pH to 4.0 resulted in a maximum biomass concentration \n\nincrease to 119.61 g.L\n-1\n\n. This increase in biomass concentration resulted in an increased \n\noxygen consumption, with levels initially dropping from 100% to values close to 0.5%, \n\nwhen it began to rise again to a value near 79% due to the depletion of the carbon \n\nsource (Figure 9f). During the addition of solution NG, DO values decreased to 23% (t = \n\n52.58 h) indicating cellular metabolic activity. After addition of solution G, DO values \n\ncontinued to decrease until it remained in the 1-4% range (Figure 9f). \n\nThe stirring rate was maintained at 600 rpm until t = 45.50 h, when the DO level was \n\n21% (Figure 9f). From this point onward, the air flow was increased to 3 L.min\n-1 \n\nand\n \nthe \n\nbioreactor was set to an automatic input so that the stirring rate would automatically \n\nincrease whenever DO values decreased below 40%, in order to keep the percentage \n\nabove this threshold, to prevent oxygen limitation. From t = 79 h, the stirring rate \n\nremained at 1400 rpm until the end of the trial. Unfortunately, DO levels kept decreasing \n\nand stabilized at a very low percentage, thus unable to ensure oxygen sufficient \n\nconditions to the yeast cells, as it can be seen in figure 9f. \n\nResidual nitrogen levels decreased from 2.43 g.L\n-1\n\n to 1.03 g.L\n-1\n\n up to t = 20.00 h, \n\ndecreasing throughout the addition of solution NG and increasing slightly until t = 51 h \n\n(0.98 g.L\n-1\n\n), right at the end of the addition of solution NG. Residual nitrogen \n\nconcentration decreased once more after adding solution G and remained below 0.5 g.L\n-\n\n1\n during the entire assay with the exception of t = 94 h with a nitrogen concentration of \n\n0.72 g.L\n-1\n\n (Figure 9e). \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n \n\nResidual glucose levels decreased from 56.33 g.L\n-1\n\n to 5.62 g.L\n-1\n\n during the batch phase \n\n(Figure 9e). During the addition of solution NG, from t = 23 h to t = 43 h, glucose \n\nconcentration remained in the 2.16-2.72 g.L\n-1\n range after which the peristaltic pump rate \n\nwas increased resulting in increasing glucose concentration levels, reaching 7.17 g.L\n-1\n\n at \n\nthe end of solution NG addition (Figure 9e). After switching to solution G, concentration \n\nlevels increased steadily and the pump rate was decreased to 0.4 rpm at t = 67.75 h and \n\nto 0.2 rpm shortly after (t = 70 h) (not shown)  to prevent glucose concentration from \n\nexceeding 40 g.L\n-1 \n\nand consequential substrate inhibition.  \n\nHowever, residual glucose concentration exceeded 40 g.L\n-1\n\n after t = 66.75 h and at the \n\nend of the assay (Figure 9e). This can be attributed to the fact that the peristaltic pump \n\nfeed rate should have been set at a lower speed rate than 0.3 rpm from 94 h onwards, in \n\norder to prevent glucose accumulation in the medium thus substrate growth inhibition. \n\nThis factor, coupled with the lack of oxygen during the remaining hours of the assay \n\n(Figure 9f) and suspicions that the glucose test strips stopped giving accurate qualitative \n\nestimates up to a certain concentration, resulted in the accumulation of glucose in the \n\nculture medium above the desired values. \n\nThe accumulation of fatty acids follows the same profile of biomass concentration up to \n\nthe stationary phase (Figures 9a and 9c) and slightly increased during the addition of \n\nsolution G. The maximum total fatty acid content in the stationary phase was obtained at \n\nt = 117.67 h corresponding to 26.19% relative to the biomass (Figure 9c). The highest \n\nfatty acid productivity was obtained at t = 96.5 h corresponding to 0.32 g L\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n. While \n\nthe total fatty acid content remained stable until the end of the assay (25-26%) fatty acid \n\nproductivity decreased along with biomass productivity (Figures 9a and 9c). \n\nAs in the previous assay, carotenoids began to be accumulated when solution G was \n\nadded to the culture during the stationary phase (t = 52.58 h) (Figure 9b). TC content \n\nincreased throughout the cultivation, especially during the stationary phase, peaking at \n\nthe end of the test with 0.15 mg.g\n-1\n\n.  \n\nFigure 10 shows the fatty acids composition obtained during this assay. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10.

The \ndata represent the mean of four determinations (two independent samples injected twice) with a \nstandard deviation lower than 10% (n = 4). \nB = batch phase; FB = fed-batch phase; NG = nutrients with glucose solution; G = concentrated \n(600 g.L\n\n-1\n) glucose solution. \n\n \n\nOleic (18:1?9), palmitic (16:0) and linoleic (18:2?6) acids were dominant. \n\nThe percentages of oleic acid (18:1?9) are in the range of those published by \n\nSawangkeaw et al. (2013) [78] for R. toruloides (18:1?9: 18-42%). As in assay I, the \n\nproportion of palmitic acid (16:0) was higher than the values reported by these authors \n\n(16:0: 13-16%). Linoleic acid (18:2?6) percentages are in the range of published values \n\n(18:2?6: 15-29%) with the exception of t = 19.00 h and t = 26.00 h, with slightly higher \n\npercentages. \n\nAt the end of the assay (t = 118.5 h), oleic acid (18: 1?9) presented a higher percentage \n\n(31.48%) of total fatty acids, followed by linoleic (18: 2?6) and palmitic (16:0) acids with \n\n27.65% and 26.82%, respectively. \n\nThe percentages of oleic (18:1?9) and palmitic acid (16:0) increased until the addition of \n\nthe solution G (t = 52.58 h), from 31.07% to 36.13% and 18.72% to 29.19%, \n\nrespectively. After addition of solution G, the proportion of both fatty acids decreased by \n\nthe end of the test (t = 118.5 h) to 31.48% and 26.82%, respectively. \n\nLinoleic (18: 2?6) and linolenic acid (18:3?3) showed the opposite profile, decreasing \n\nduring the addition of solution NG (from 31.88% to 20.56% and 14.31% to 4.33%, \n\nrespectively) and then increased until the end of the assay (to 27.65% and to 5.45%, \n\nrespectively). \n\nStearic acid (18:0) was detected with percentages lower than 10%, increasing from \n\n4.02% to 8.27% until the addition of solution G. After the addition, the proportion of \n\nstearic acid (18:0) decreased reaching values lower than 1% and was not detected at \n\nthe end of the assay. The percentages of stearic acid (18:0) are in the range of values \n\npublished values Sawangkeaw et al. (2013) before adding solution G. After addition, the \n\nB NG \n\nFB \n\nG \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n \n\nacid can be found with lower values than those reported by these authors (18: 0: 4-\n\n41%). \n\nMyristic acid (14:0) and palmitoleic acid (16:1?9) reached 1.52% and 7.91%, \n\nrespectively, at t = 67.67 h, values which are not present in yeast biomass obtained \n\nduring assay I at pH 5.5 and are in accordance with Jeenor et al. (2006) [81] who state \n\nthat oxygen limited conditions modifies the activity of elongases, enzymes involved in \n\nthe synthesis of long chain fatty acids..  \n\nLinolenic acid (18: 3?3) percentage was below 12%, except at t = 19.00 h with 14.31%. \n\nNo polyunsaturated fatty acids with four or more double bonds were detected. Therefore, \n\nthe yeast biomass fatty acids profile for this assay fulfills the European standard \n\nrequirements. \n\nFigure 11 shows the percentage of saturated fatty acids (SFA) monounsaturated fatty \n\nacids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) throughout this assay. \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\nFigure 11.

MUFA have a maximum at t = 67.75 \n\nh with 42.59%, PUFA at t = 19.00 h with 46.19% and SFA at t = 49.50 h corresponding \n\nto 38.98%. \n\nMUFA ranged between 31.07% and 42.59% throughout the assay, increasing from \n\n29.29% to 36.13% during the addition of solution NG. MUFA continued to increase \n\nduring the addition of solution G until t = 67.75 h (42.59%), decreasing to the end of the \n\nassay (38.81%). \n\nSFA ranged between 22.74% and 38.98% throughout the test, increasing during the \n\naddition of solution NG (from 22.74% to 38.98%) and decreasing during the addition of \n\nsolution G until the end of the assay (28.09%). \n\nFB \n\nG NB B \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n \n\nPUFA ranged between 24.89% and 46.19% throughout the test, exhibiting the opposite \n\nprofile of MUFA and SFA, decreasing during the addition of solution NG (from 46.19% to \n\n24.89%) and increasing until the end of the experiment to 33.10%. \n\n \n\n4.2.3. Assay III \n\nDespite problems from oxygen deprivation, the results from assay II confirmed that the \n\noptimum pH for the production of yeast biomass is 4.0. The same parallel studies that \n\nled to this conclusion also revealed that the optimum pH for carotenoids and fatty acids \n\nproduction by R.toruloides is 5.0 (unpublished results).  \n\nIn this assay, we used the same system and feeding strategy used in assays I and II. \n\nIn this assay, we adjusted the pH to 4.0 during the yeast\u2019s growth phase and, once the \n\nculture reached the stationary phase, at which growth cell division slows down, we \n\nadjusted the pH of the culture medium to 5.0 to promote the accumulation of lipidic \n\nstorage products such as carotenoids. In this assay we set the speed rate depending on \n\nthe DO readings, so that above the threshold of 40% DO the speed rate increased in \n\norder to increase the kLa (volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient) thus the oxygen \n\navailability in the system. The air inflow was also increased.  \n\nFigure 12 shows the profiles of the biomass concentration, OD, biomass productivity, the \n\nnatural logarithm of the biomass, DO, stirring rate, residual glucose and nitrogen \n\nconcentrations, fatty acid percentage and productivity, TC concentration and productivity \n\nfor this assay. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nB \nFB \n\nG \n\npH 4 pH 5 pH 4 pH 5 \n\nG B NG \nFB \n\na) NG \n\nb) \n\nc) \n\nd) \n\ne) \n\nf) \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n \n\nFigure 12.

Solution G was added to the bioreactor at t = 49.5 h. The \n\npH was changed from 4.0 to 5.0 at t = 92 h. \n\nThe culture entered the stationary phase at t = 64 h with a biomass concentration of 102 \n\ng.L\n-1\n\n corresponding to 144.5 OD and a biomass productivity of 1.59 gL\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n (Figure 12a). \n\nThe maximum biomass concentration was 128.26 g.L\n-1\n\n at t = 159 h with a biomass yield \n\nof 0.80 g.L\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n and 181 OD (Figure 12a). \n\nThe maximum biomass productivity was reached at t = 44.00 h (1.94 g.L\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n) with a \n\nbiomass concentration of 86.06 g.L\n-1\n\n (Figure 12a). \n\nThe glucose added to the pre-inoculum was consumed as shown by the DO profile \n\ndropping from 100% to levels close to zero then increasing to 86.25% right before \n\nadding solution NG (Figure 12f). Feeding the bioreactor with solution NG (from t = 19.5 \n\nto t = 46.5 h) decreased DO levels once again due to yeast cells\u2019 metabolic activity. \n\nFrom t = 46.5 h to the end of the assay, the same problem from the previous assay \n\noccurred, with oxygen levels dropping and staying below 40% (Figure 12f).  \n\nResidual nitrogen levels decreased from 2.34 g.L\n-1\n\n to 0.89 g.L\n-1\n\n up to t = 20.00 h, \n\ndecreasing throughout the addition of NG and G solutions until t = 67.5 h when it started \n\nto increase until t = 164 h to 0.60 g.L\n-1\n\n (Figure 12e). This increase was due to inaccurate \n\nammonia titrations when determining residual nitrogen. \n\nResidual glucose levels decreased from 66.81 g.L\n-1\n\n to 1.23 g.L\n-1\n\n during the batch phase, \n\nremaining in the 1.23-3.69 g.L\n-1\n\n range from t = 20 h to t = 46.5 h (Figure 12e). When \n\nsolution G was added, the residual glucose concentration attained 40 g.L\n-1\n\n at t = 67.5 h. \n\nAt this time, the pump speed rate was decreased to 0.3 rpm, after which residual \n\nglucose concentration decreased to 18.48 g.L\n-1\n at t = 70.5 h, increasing again to a \n\nconcentration level close to 40 g.L\n-1\n\n (35.70 g.L\n-1\n) at t = 87 h. Decreasing the pump\u2019s \n\nspeed rate to 0.2 rpm (not shown) managed to keep residual glucose concentration \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n \n\nbelow 40 g.L\n-1 \n\nuntil the end of the cultivation (Figure 12e). It is worth noting that at t = 92 \n\nh, when the pH in the bioreactor was changed to 5.0, glucose levels decreased. When \n\nanalyzing figure 12b, one can see that even though carotenoid accumulation began after \n\nsupplying the yeast cells with the concentrated glucose solution, it increased even \n\nfurther after the pH changed, reaching a peak at t = 159.5 h with 0.18 mg.g\n-1\n\n. This peak \n\nvalue was higher than the previous assay, the same as observed with the maximum \n\ncarotenoid productivity (0.16 mg.L\n-1\n\nh\n-1\n\n at t = 120 h). Fatty acids also show an increase \n\nafter the pH change, reaching a peak at t = 183 h with 27.88%. Although fatty acid \n\nproductivity was lower (0.29 g.L\n-1\n\nh\n-1\n\n) than in assay II, the maximum productivity in this \n\nassay was reached earlier and also after the pH change (t = 93.50 h). The \n\naforementioned results are consistent with our conclusions that pH 5.0 is the optimum \n\nvalue for the production of carotenoids and fatty acids. \n\nFigure 13 shows the fatty acids composition obtained during this assay. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 13.

(2013) [78] for R. toruloides (18:1?9: 18-42%). As in assay I and \n\nII, the proportion of palmitic acid (16:0) was higher than the values reported by these \n\nauthors (16:0: 13-16%). Linoleic acid (18:2?6) percentages are in the range of published \n\nvalues (18:2?6: 15-29%) with the exception of t ? 159.5 h. \n\nNG G \n\nFB \npH 4 pH 5 \n\n B \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n \n\nAt the end of the assay (t = 184 h), linoleic acid (18:2?6) presented a higher percentage \n\n(32.29%) of total fatty acids, followed by oleic (18:1?9) and palmitic (16:0) with 29.61% \n\nand 24.24%, respectively. \n\nOleic acid (18:1?9) percentage increased until the pump\u2019s speed rate was adjusted to \n\n0.8 rpm (not shown), from 29.78% to 35.93%. \n\nPalmitic acid (16:0) increased until the addition of the concentrated glucose solution (t = \n\n49.5) from 21.69% to 29.00%. After supplying the culture medium with the concentrated \n\nglucose solution, the proportion of both fatty acids decreased to the end of the test (t = \n\n187 h). \n\nLinoleic (18:2?6) and linolenic acid (18:3?3) showed the opposite profile, decreasing \n\nduring the addition of solution NG (from 29.05% to 20.33% and 11.89% to 4.90%, \n\nrespectively) and increased until the end of the assay (to 32.29% and to 6.52%, \n\nrespectively). \n\nThe percentages of stearic acid (18:0) remain somewhat stable throughout the whole \n\nassay and are in the range of values published by Sawangkeaw et al. (2013) [78]. \n\nPalmitoleic acid (16:1?9) was not detected in this assay. \n\nLinolenic acid (18:3?3) stayed below 12% and no polyunsaturated fatty acids with four \n\nor more double bonds were detected, therefore  R. toruloides fatty acids for this assay \n\nalso fulfill the European standard requirements. \n\nFigure 14 shows the percentage of saturated fatty acids (SFA) monounsaturated fatty \n\nacids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) for this assay. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 14.

The culture medium pH was changed from 4.0 to 5.0 at t = 87 h. Air inflow was \n\nincreased to 5 L.h\n-1\n\n at t = 43.5 h (not shown) \n\nThe culture entered the stationary phase at t = 87 h with a biomass concentration of \n\n126.14 g.L\n-1\n\n corresponding to 178 OD and a biomass productivity of 1.45 gL\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n (Figure \n\n14a). \n\nResidual nitrogen levels decreased from 1.70 g.L\n-1\n\n to 0.36 g.L\n-1\n\n up to t = 20.00 h, \n\noscillating during the addition of NG and G solutions until the pH was changed to 5.0 \n\nwhen it started to increase and oscillating again at the end of the assay (Figure 14e). \n\nOnce more, this increase was due to inaccurate ammonia titrations when determining \n\nresidual nitrogen.  \n\nResidual glucose levels decreased from 58.54 g.L\n-1\n\n to 2.08 g.L\n-1\n\n during the batch phase \n\n(Figure 14e). At the end of solution NG addition period, levels started rising until the pH \n\nchange indicating that the culture reached the stationary phase. Then it decreased until t \n\n= 113 h increasing afterwards until the end of the assay when it reached levels close to \n\n40 g.L\n-1 \n\n(Figure 14e). \n\nThe use of two Rushton impellers gave positive results. Although DO readings reached \n\npercentages below 40% from t = 81.84 h to t = 97 h and t ? 161.55 h, the overall \n\npercentages were much higher and were maintained for much longer periods when \n\ncompared to the previous assays (Figure 14f). The effects of a higher oxygen availability \n\nare evident by the higher biomass concentration (154.21 g.L\n-1 \n\nat t = 207 h) (Figure 14a), \n\nbiomass productivity (2.35 g.L\n-1\n\n.h\n-1 \n\nat\n \nt = 45.5 h) (Figure 14a), fatty acids productivity \n\n(0.40 g.L\n-1\n\n.h\n-1 \n\nat t = 45.5 h) (Figure 14c), carotenoids productivity (0.29 g.L\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n at t = 87 \n\nh) (Figure 14b) and TC content (0.29 mg.g\n-1\n\n at t = 157 h) attained in this experiment \n\n(Figure 14b). \n\nFigure 16 shows the fatty acids composition obtained during this assay. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 16.

Palmitic acid (16:0) percentages are \n\nabove the range given by these authors (16:0: 13-16%). Linoleic acid (18:2?6) \n\npercentages are in the range of published values (18:2?6: 15-29%) with the exception of \n\nt ? 160 h. Stearic acid (18:0) percentages are in the range of published values. \n\nAt the end of the assay (t = 255 h), linoleic acid (18:2?6) represented the majority of \n\ntotal fatty acids with 36.89%, followed by oleic (18:1?9) and palmitic (16:0) acids with \n\n27.65% and 22.21%, respectively. \n\nOleic acid (18:1?9) percentage increased until t = 63 h, from 30% to 35.76%, then \n\ndecreasing up to t = 255 h to 27.65%. \n\nPalmitic acid (16:0) increased until t = 39 h from 20.66% to 29.28%, decreasing \n\nafterwards until the end of the assay to 22.21%. \n\nLinoleic (18:2?6) increased slightly up to t = 20 h (from 28.44% to 30%) and then \n\nshowed the same profile as linolenic acid (18:3?3), decreasing during the addition of \n\nsolution NG (from 30% to 20.61% and 14.66% to 4.50%, respectively) and increasing \n\nuntil the end of the assay (to 36.89% and to 6.98%, respectively). \n\nPalmitoleic (16:1?9) and myristoleic (14:1) acids were both detected in this assay at t = \n\n113 h with very low percentages (0.49% and 0.52%, respectively). \n\nWith the exception of t = 15 h, linolenic acid (18:3?3) remained below 12% and no \n\npolyunsaturated fatty acids with four or more double bonds were detected, therefore the \n\n  NG   G \n  FB \n\npH 4 \n\n  B \n\npH 5 \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n \n\nfatty acids profile  is in accordance with the requirements imposed by the European \n\nstandard. \n\nFigure 17 shows the percentage of saturated fatty acids (SFA) monounsaturated fatty \n\nacids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) for this assay. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 17.

The maximum biomass concentration obtained for assay II, as well as in assays \n\nIII and IV, were higher than the concentration reported by Li et al. (2007) (106.5 g.L\n-1\n\n) \n\nusing Rhodosporidium toruloides Y4 grown in 15 L bioreactors in fed-batch cultivations \n\nwith glucose as the carbon source [82].  \n\nFatty acid and total lipid percentages and carotenoid concentration in assay II were \n\nlower than in assay I. The lack of oxygen in the culture may explain this reduction \n\ncompared to the previous trial. However, even with this limitation, the maximum fatty \n\nacid concentration in assay II was higher than the previous assay, possibly due to higher \n\nbiomass productivity, which is tightly related to fatty acid synthesis [54]. \n\nThe results in assay IV, due to a more efficient oxygen distribution to the culture, are in \n\nagreement with those from Saenge et al. (2011b) who reported a significant increase in \n\nthe biomass concentration and lipid production and a slight increase of carotenoid \n\nproduction after increasing the aeration rate in Rhodotorula glutinis fed-batch cultures \n\n[83]. Other authors have also reported the positive effects of aeration on carotenoid \n\ncontent [84-86]. \n\nHowever, carotenoid values for assay IV were relatively low compared to the results \n\nobtained by Saenge et al. (2011a; 2011b) [32, 83]. In contrast, the total lipid \n\nconcentration values obtained by these authors were much lower than the results \n\nobtained in all assays. Observing the decrease of the maximum fatty acid percentage \n\nand fatty acid concentration in assay IV, it might suggest that fatty acid and carotenoid \n\nproduction are inverse to one another. This can be explained by the fact that fatty acids \n\nare, as previously mentioned, a product uniquely associated with the yeast\u2019s growth [54] \n\nwhile carotenoids are a mixed product (associated with the growth and also produced in \n\nthe stationary phase, as reserves) [54, 87]. \n\nAssays I and IV show higher fatty acid productivity than the productivity obtained by \n\nZhao et al. (2011) [88] for a fed-batch system with intermittent 30 g.L\n-1\n\n glucose feed \n\n(0.36 g.L\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n). The fatty acid productivity obtained in assay IV was higher than the value \n\nreported by the same authors but with continuous 30 g.L\n-1\n\n glucose feed (0.39 g.L\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n). \n\nTotal lipid content in the biomass for all assays was lower than the percentages given by \n\nWiebe et al. (2012) [89] when using glucose (48 - 75%) in their nitrogen restricted \n\nmedium used to cultivate Rhodosporidium toruloides in batch and fed-batch cultures in \n\n0.5 L bioreactors at pH 4. With the exception of assay II, total lipid content of yeast \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n \n\nbiomass for the other assays are in the range of those observed by Wiebe et al. (2012) \n\nwhen using xylose as the carbon source (36 - 45%), and higher than the percentages \n\nobtained when using arabinose (15 - 19%) [89]. \n\nAll assays presented fatty acid compositions fulfilling EN 14214 requirements (with the \n\nexception of t = 19 h in assay II and t = 15 h in assay IV, with 18:3?3 percentages above \n\n12%). \n\nLow amounts of PUFA and SFA are required to ensure good quality biodiesel with \n\nsatisfactory properties [90], therefore the fatty acid composition from assay II is the one \n\nthat guarantees the best biodiesel properties due to its high MUFA content. The higher \n\nlevels of PUFA in R. toruloides oil found in assay IV gives its biodiesel lower oxidative \n\nstability [32]. However, this is not impeditive to obtain a good quality biodiesel if \n\nassociated with other oils [91]. \n\n \n\n4.4. Flow Cytometry \n\nIn this study we used FC to detect cell viability during the development of all cultivations. \n\nThis technique also allowed us to quantify the TC content produced by R. toruloides \n\n(Section 3.8.2.) and monitor cell viability by detecting the integrity of the cytoplasmic \n\nmembrane and mitochondrial membrane potential (Section 3.8.1.), in real time. Previous \n\nsubpopulation controls were performed by Freitas et al. (2014) for R. toruloides [54] \n\n(Annex II). \n\nFigures 18 to 21 show the sub-populations profiles obtained from the density plots of R. \n\ntoruloides cells double-stained with DiOC6(3) and PI, harvested during assays I \u2013 IV, in \n\ndifferent physiological states. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 18.

This \n\nincrease is attributed to cell stress induced by starvation from the yeast cells\u2019 metabolic \n\nactivity when consuming the glucose present in the pre-cultures at the end of the batch \n\nphase. \n\nParticularly in assay I, at the end of the batch phase, the proportion of intact cells with \n\npolarized membranes reached 65%, and the proportion of cells with intact and \n\ndepolarized membranes was 35% (Figure 17). When solution NG was added, the \n\nproportion of intact cells with polarized membranes increased and stabilized at values \n\nclose to 88 % during the G solution feeding period. Intact cells with depolarized \n\nmembranes remained at around 6% (Figure 17) during the addition of the concentrated \n\nglucose solution while cells with permeabilized membranes stayed at very low \n\npercentages throughout the whole assay.  \n\nAssay II displays the highest percentage of stressed cells and the lowest proportion of \n\nintact and polarized cells compared to other assays. The sharp drop in the polarized \n\ncells proportion and the simultaneous increase in the depolarized cells proportion at t = \n\n44 h (Figure 18) was coincident with the drop in DO and glucose concentration during \n\nthis assay (Figure 18). \n\nAssay III presents 49.6% of permeabilized cells at the end of the batch period. The \n\npercentage of intact cells with depolarized membrane increased after switching to the \n\nconcentrated glucose solution, ranging between 12-13.0% until the end of this assay, \n\nwhile the proportion of normal cells remained at about 83% during the feeding period \n\n(Figure 19). \n\nOnce again, the effects of aeration in assay IV can be seen when looking at the profiles \n\ndisplayed in figure 20, showing the highest percentage of intact and polarized cells out of \n\nall assays. In contrast, cells with depolarized membrane and permeabilized membrane \n\nremained at very low percentages, the former never exceeding 13% while the latter \n\nalways remained below 6%. \n\n \n\n5. Conclusions and future prospects \n\nThis work\u2019s aim was to implement a suitable strategy for the improvement of lipids and \n\ncarotenoids production by the red yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides NCYC 921 grown in \n\na fed-batch bench 7L-reactor under various conditions.  \n\nWorking with a medium pH of 4 gave the highest biomass concentration and biomass \n\nproductivity compared to our first assay with a medium pH of 5.5. However, as a result of \n\nselecting the most suitable pH for high density growth, the production of storage \n\nmaterials was diminished. Failure to predict how much the dissolved oxygen in the \n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n \n\nmedium would decrease at the time, due to increased cell growth, also contributed to the \n\npoor results in this assay, due to oxygen limiting conditions. \n\nChanging the pH medium from 4 to 5 during the stationary phase was successful, as \n\nbiomass, lipid and carotenoid productivities increased. Still, it was not until we provided \n\nmore efficient aeration that we observed oxygen was indeed fundamental during the \n\nyeast cultivation, giving the highest productivities out of all assays.  \n\nFC proved to be an useful tool for monitoring yeast cells near real time, giving us instant \n\nquantification of TC as well as observe their physiological states as the cultivation \n\nconditions in the bioreactor changed, allowing us to immediately control the entire \n\nprocess to best suit the yeast\u2019s needs to ensure the best results. This would have not \n\nbeen possible if we had used time consuming traditional microbiological techniques that \n\nwould have only given results long after the entire process had ended.  \n\nUsing FC, we found that mitochondrial activity and integrity of the cytoplasmic \n\nmembrane of R. toruloides cells are affected by lack of nutrients and oxygen. \n\nHaving already found a way to improve lipids and carotenoids production, the next step \n\nin our work will focus on the process optimization. It is expected that the scale-up step \n\nusing low-cost industrial by-products such as carob pulp syrup as a carbon source \n\n(using a 35 L reactor) will make the process more cost-efficient. \n\n \n\nReferences \n \n1.
