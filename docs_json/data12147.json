Their determination \nin geological samples is important and complex due to their low concentrations and problems \nwith spectral and non-spectral interferences. Herein, the operating conditions of an inductively \ncoupled plasma optical emission spectrometer were optimized for the determination of REEs \nusing experimental designs. The signal-to-background ratio (SBR) of the REEs emission signals \nand the Mg II/Mg I line intensity ratio were evaluated as response functions. According to the \nresults obtained, three different sets of operating conditions were selected and classified as robust, \nsemi-robust and best SBR conditions. Limits of detection (LOD), SBR and relative standard \ndeviation of the blank solution (RSDblank) were determined. The semi-robust condition (RF power \nof 1250 W and nebulizer gas flow rate of 0.90 L min?1) exhibited lower LOD and RSDblank than \nothers tested operating conditions.\n\nKeywords: rare earth elements, ICP OES, optimization, SBR, Mg II/Mg I\n\nIntroduction\n\nInductively coupled plasma optical emission \nspectrometry (ICP OES) has been widely used for multi-\nelement analysis and is recognized as one of the most \neffective techniques for determination of major, minor and \ntrace elements including the rare earth elements (REEs) \nin geological samples with complex matrices.1-4 Recently, \n\ninductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) \nhas shown to be a powerful tool for the direct determination \nof REEs, but it is still too expensive and unavailable for \nmany laboratories. On the other hand, ICP OES is more \naffordable and shows good analytical qualities, such as \nprecision and accuracy, relatively low limits of detection, \nhigh sample throughput, simultaneous determination of \nmost elements and wide dynamic range.5-7\n\nFrom a geological point of view, the determination of \nREEs is vital to understand the geochemical processes in \n\n\n\nEvaluation of Signal-to-Background and Mg II/Mg I Ratios J. Braz. Chem. Soc.754\n\nwhich rocks have been formed and to provide information \nabout the environment.8-10 Several instrumental techniques \nare currently employed for REEs determination such as \ninstrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA), isotopic \ndilution mass-spectrometry (ID-MS), atomic absorption \nspectrometry (AAS), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), inductively \ncoupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES) \nand inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry \n(ICP-MS). Frequently the determination of almost all \nREEs is carried out by a combination of methods, including \nchemical separation.11,12\n\nGeological materials present some analytical challenges \nrelated to complex matrix composition and low REEs \nconcentrations in most samples. The main constituents in a \ngeological sample (rocks, soils and sediments) are Si, Al, Fe, \nTi, Mn, Mg, Ca, Na and K. These elements can contribute \nto high levels of chemical or spectral interferences \nand spurious background emissions due to the matrix \ncomplexity. Aluminum, Ca, Fe and to a lesser extesion Ti \ncan cause significant background in many regions of the \nspectrum or give rise to serious line overlap interferences \nin the determination of trace elements.13 Easily ionized \nelements (EIEs), such as alkalis, Na and K, with their low \nfirst ionization potential can cause a shift in the spatial \ndistribution of analyte-ionization equilibrium.14-16 Calcium, \nTi and Mn are elements with a low second ionization \npotential that can cause severe matrix effects.17,18 These \neffects on the REEs emission signal will be discussed in a \nfuture work. In order to overcome some of these restrictions,  \nsample pretreatment procedures have been extensively \nemployed to separate and preconcentrate analytes prior \nto analysis.19 The optimization of the operating conditions \nis also an important step in the analytical sequence to \nguarantee the best analytical performance. The goal of any \nanalytical procedure is to achieve a measurement with high \nlevel of sensitivity, great accuracy and precision, and the \nlowest limit of detection. Furthermore, the measurement \ntechnique should be robust.20\n\nGood sensitivity is required for the determination of \nREEs in geological samples because these trace elements \nare found in complex matrices. Also, robustness is an \nimportant factor in the optimization of the ICP since the \nplasma must be able to deal with a matrix change without \naffecting plasma conditions, such as temperature and \nelectron number density. Plasma conditions are easily \nevaluated using Mg II (280 nm) and Mg I (285 nm) line \nintensity ratio,21,22 a parameter that has gained almost \nuniversal popularity in the ICP OES community.23 The \nsignal-to-background ratio (SBR) is another parameter \ncommonly applied since it can be correlated to limits of \ndetection.24 Choosing one parameter instead of another \n\ncould lead to the use of a different set of operating \nconditions.\n\nICP has a wide variety of possible optimization \nparameters, including the operating conditions and \ninstrumental variations related to types of torches and \nsample introduction system. Some factors have an \nexpressive influence on the plasma excitation conditions, \nsuch as radio frequency (RF) incident power, nebulizer \ngas flow rate, auxiliary gas flow rate, plasma gas flow rate, \nsample uptake rate and observation height.13,24 In ICP OES, \nwhen radial view is used, at least three parameters must be \ntaken into account: incident applied power, nebulizer gas \nflow rate and observation height.\n\nMost of the studies about the determination of REEs \ndeals with the optimization of the separation and pre-\nconcentration step, but ICP OES operating conditions are \nnot optimized. These operating condition are only cited, \nsometimes based on previous works, such as the paper of \nWalsh et al..25 This is quite common in geochemical studies \nsince the main purpose is the interpretation of the REEs \npattern in environmental samples and not the development \nand the optimization of methodology. The optimization \nof ICP OES operating conditions for the determination \nof REEs has received little attention and there are not \nmany works in the literature about the behavior of these \nelements in different conditions. Conversely, major and \ntrace elements, specially toxic elements like As, Cd, Cr, \nHg, and Pb are extensively discussed in the literature.26-30\n\nIn this work, the operating conditions of ICP OES \nwere optimized aiming for reaching the best conditions \nfor REEs determination (La, Nd, Eu, Gd, Dy, Er and \nYb) based on robustness and sensitivity. Two different \nparameters were evaluated and compared as responses to \nobtain the optimum conditions: Mg II/Mg I line intensity \nratio and SBR values of the REEs. Doehlert design was \napplied for the optimization of radio frequency applied \npower, nebulizer gas flow rate, sample uptake rate and \nobservation height.\n\nExperimental\n\nInstrumentation\n\nAll measurements were performed with a simultaneous \nICP OES spectrometer Spectro (Germany), model Ciros \nCCD with radial view. A Scott type double-pass spray \nchamber and a cross-flow nebulizer were used throughout \nthe experiments. The detailed description of the equipment \nand operational parameters are presented in Table 1. The \nwavelengths selected and the ionization and excitation \nenergies are reported in Table 2. \n\n\n\nGuimar\u00e3es-Silva et al. 755Vol. 23, No. 4, 2012\n\nThe selection includes 7 elements and 4 or 5 ionic lines \nfor each element, and the sum of ionization and excitation \nenergies of the lines ranging from 8.40 to 13.41 eV. \nAnalytical lines were selected based on sensitivity and \nminimum spectral interference. Spectral line interferences \ndue to Si, Al, Ti, Fe, Mn, Mg, Ca, Na and K were evaluated \nby scanning the spectra of the analytes and the interfering \nelements using the profile mode of the analysis program. An \nimproper analytical line selection may result in significant \nloss of detection power or accuracy for samples containing \ncomplex matrices. Therefore, the appropriate choice of \nanalytical line is crucial to avoid interferences and ensure \nthe quality of analysis.31\n\nReagents, samples and test solutions\n\nHigh-purity water was supplied from a Millipore \nMilli-Q ion-exchange system (Millipore, Billerica, \nMA, USA). The concentrated nitric, hydrochloric and \nhydrofluoric acids employed were of analytical-reagent \ngrade (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Laboratory glassware \nwas kept overnight in a 10% (v/v) nitric acid solution and \nbefore use the glassware was rinsed with ultrapure water. \nReference solutions were prepared from 1 g L?1 certified \nstandard solutions (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ, USA) \nfor REEs (La, Nd, Eu, Gd, Dy, Er and Yb) and for major \ncommon constituents in geological matrices (Al, Fe, Mn, \nTi, Na, K, Ca and Mg).\n\nThe emission signals were evaluated in solutions with \nand without the matrix medium. The concentrations of the \nconcomitants in test solutions were prepared according to \ntypical mean concentrations presented in relevant geological \n\nsamples routinely analyzed in the laboratory. Final solutions \nwere acidified with 5% (v/v) HNO3. Digests from geological \nsamples was mixed to use in some spectra measurements, \nconsidering the effect of the matrix medium in the emission \nsignal of REEs. Two certified reference materials (CRMs) \nwere used to evaluate the accuracy in the proposed operating \nconditions: AC-E (granite) from Centre de Recherches \nP\u00e9trographiques et G\u00e9ochimiques - CNRS (Vandoeuvre-l\u00e8s-\nNancy, France) and GBW 07309 (stream sediment) from the \nNational Research Centre (Hepingjie, China).\n\nSample preparation\n\nThe sample preparation procedure for geological \nsamples was previously described by Moutte.33 A 250 mg \nportion of sample was directly and accurately weighted into \n\nTable 2.

The response \nsurface in Figure1a illustrates the influence of main factors \non the response (Mg II/Mg I line intensity ratio) when a \nsolution containing only Mg and REEs was analyzed. The \nnebulizer gas flow rate and RF applied power were found \nto be the most significant factors. A robust condition was \nobtained at high RF power and low nebulizer gas flow \nrate, as expected and described in the literature.36-38A \nresponse surface maximum point was not obtained; an \never-increasing pattern was observed until the instrumental \nlimits. The thresholds between robust and non-robust \nconditions were established.\n\nAlso, the robustness was tested in a simulated multi-\nelement solution with the common constituents of a \ngeological matrix in the respective concentrations (in \nmg L?1): Al 800, Fe 600, Ti 80, Mn 25, Na 200, K 200, \nand Ca 400. These concentrations are commonly observed \nin samples analyzed in routine studies of the laboratory. \nMagnesium was the test element and was considered at \nthe concentration of 5 mg L?1. It was possible to observe a \ndecrease in the value of Mg II/Mg I, but the general trend \nis the same determined to the solution without matrix \n(Figures 1a and 1b).\n\nThe main factors had the same influence in the \nrobustness, and a maximum point was not obtained. There \nwas a mean decrease in Mg II/Mg I line intensity ratio of \nabout 8%. Therefore, to maintain robust conditions in the \npresence of the matrix medium, higher RF applied power \nand lower nebulizer gas flow rate should be considered. If \nthe optimization process was carried out with an aqueous \nsolution without matrix medium, then the Mg II/Mg I \nintensity ratio above 9 should be needed to guarantee robust \nconditions in matrix medium. Both designs demonstrated \nthat above 90% of the variance can be explained by the \nproposed model in the evaluation of robustness.\n\nMermet and co-workers22,39 defined robustness as the \ncapability of the ICP system to accept a change in the \nconcentration of major elements, acids, and other elements, \nwithout any significant variation in the line intensity of the \nanalytes. This concept has become quite common in ICP \n\noptimization studies and can be easily measured using \nionic-to-atomic line intensity ratio as Mg II (280 nm) and \nMg I (285 nm).27,36,40-42 Since ionic lines are more sensitive \nto changes in atomization and excitation conditions than \natomic lines, the intensity ratio of the lines is a practical \ncriterion to evaluate the plasma robustness and analytical \nperformance. A robust condition can be achieved when \nhigher RF applied power level (? 1200 W) is combined \nwith lower nebulizer gas flow rate (? 0.6 L min-1)37,38,43,44 \nand this condition is characterized by the high intensity \nratio of Mg II/Mg I, values above 8.22\n\nSensitivity -signal-to-background ratio (SBR)\n\nBecause of the spectral complexity, low sensitivity \nand interference combined with the low abundance of \nREEs, a set of operating condition should be considered \n\nFigure 1. Effect of RF applied power and nebulizer gas flow rate on  \nMg II/Mg I line intensity ratio (a) without and (b) with the matrix solution.\n\n\n\nEvaluation of Signal-to-Background and Mg II/Mg I Ratios J. Braz. Chem. Soc.758\n\nto improve the signal-to-background ratio during the \ndetermination of REEs in geological samples. The \nDoehlert design demonstrated that the main factors \nwhich are able to influence the SBR value of the REEs \nwere RF applied power and nebulizer gas flow rate as \nwell as for robustness. However, in this case, the RF \nincident power was more significant than the nebulizer \ngas flow rate. The RF applied power is directly linked to \nthe amount of energy transferred to the species and has a \ndirect influence on net signal intensities and SBR value.45 \n\nUnlike what was observed for robustness, both parameters \ndemonstrated negative estimated effects leading to a set \nof operating conditions with lower RF applied power \nand intermediate nebulizer gas flow rate to obtain higher  \nSBR values.\n\nResponse surfaces were obtained for each element by \nplotting the SBR of each element against the RF applied \npower and nebulizer gas flow rate. The results were \nobtained for solutions containing REEs in presence and \nabsence of matrix. It was possible to observe the uniform \nbehavior of SBR values in relation to the variation of \nthe operating conditions. All analytical lines considered \nfor REEs exhibited a similar distribution profile and \nthe matrix tested did not significantly affect the value \nof SBR. Therefore a La line (408.672 nm) was chosen \nto exemplify the response surface obtained without and \nwith matrix medium (Figures 2a and 2b, respectively). A \nmaximum point was found at the operating conditions: RF \napplied power of 1100 W and nebulizer gas flow rate of \n0.9 L min?1. Walsh et al.25 also reported the application of a \ncondition with lower-power to improve the SBR, which is \na different condition commonly adopted to analyze major \nand trace elements in geological samples. Some papers \npublished later cited this work as a reference condition \nto REEs.46 Others only cited the operating conditions \nadopted; in most cases, with RF applied power between \n1000-1200 W.2,47 Recently, Bentlin and Pozebon48 reported \nthe optimization related to the sample introduction system \napplying pneumatic and ultrasonic nebulization for the \ndetermination of REEs. In this work, the RF applied \npower and nebulizer gas flow rate were optimized only \nbased on the Mg II/Mg I. Thus, a condition with higher \nRF applied power was applied considering values between \n1300 and 1400 W, and nebulizer gas flow rate was  \n0.75 L min?1.\n\nIn ICP OES, the experimental spectral intensity is a \ngross signal (S+B), which consists of the sum of the line \nintensity, S, plus the background, B. The background \ncorresponds to the emission originating from the blank \nsolution. Then the net signal is obtained by subtracting \nthe value of the background, B. The simplest net signal \n\nmeasurement consists of a direct measurement of the gross \nline intensity (S+Bpeak) at the central wavelength of the \nanalyte line.49 The signal will be processed unambiguously \nif the analytical signal is stand out from the background, \nwhich requires a meaning SBR value. The SBR is a \ntraditional response used in optimization approach and it \nis also a figure of merit that can be correlated with limit \nof detection.24\n\nIt is important to consider the behavior of the \nbackground signal during the evaluation of SBR. There was \nan increase in analytical signals of REEs when increasing \nRF applied power, increasing nebulizer gas flow rate and \nat higher observation height. However, the background \nsignal also had a sharp rise which led to a decrease in SBR \nvalues of the REEs (Figure 3a). Since an increase in power \nincreases the background signals more than the analyte \nemission signals with subsequent decrease in SBR, it is \nassumed that a lower applied power seems to be the best \nchoice for analyzing REEs by ICP OES. \n\nFigure 2. Effect of RF applied power and nebulizer gas flow rate on \nSBR value of La 408.672 nm in solution (a) without and (b) with matrix \nmedium.\n\n\n\nGuimar\u00e3es-Silva et al. 759Vol. 23, No. 4, 2012\n\nInstrumental operating conditions - robustness and \nsensitivity\n\nWhen the operating conditions are established considering \nthe sensitivity of the system based on SBR values, conditions \nwith lower RF applied power settings would be applied and \nthe robustness would be affected. In order to avoid this type \nof mistake, robustness and SBR ratio can be considered \ntogether during the optimization processes. In this case, \nrobustness was defined by line intensity ratio of Mg; on the \nother hand, SBR values were directly related to analytes. \nThe Mg II/Mg I ratio and SBR values led to different \nsets of operating conditions because the emission lines \nconsidered in each response reacted differently to changes \non excitation conditions. Evaluating the operating condition \nbased on Mg II/Mg I the nebulizer gas flow rate was a more \nimportant parameter than the RF applied power. Conversely, \nconsidering the optimization with the SBR values of REEs \nthe RF applied power was more significant and critical \ninfluence in the background was observed.\n\nThe main difference was related to changes in the RF \napplied power as can be seen in the behavior of the ionic \nlines of Mg and La in Figures 3a and 3b. Comparing REEs \n(e.g. La II 408 nm) with magnesium (Mg II 280 nm), an \nincrease in RF applied power was followed by decreasing \nin SBR values of REEs and an increase in SBR value \nof Mg. All REEs ionic lines studied revealed the same \npattern. The behavior of analytical signal and SBR value \ncan be affected by different factors as range of wavelength, \nionization state, excitation energy for atomic lines and \nenergy sum for ionic lines. In addition, the background \nemission signal had an important effect on the SBR.24,45 \nFor some lines, the contribution of the background was \nhigher than for others, probably because of the very low \nsensitivity of some lines. Non-robust conditions should be \navoided for analytical applications dealing with complex \nmatrices to guarantee precision and accuracy. But it cannot \nbe the only one criterion in method development, mainly \nbecause it does not consider the behavior of the background \nemission signal that can be crucial in complex matrices.\n\nThe results obtained allowed the selection of three \ndifferent sets of operating conditions (Table 4), classified \n\non their robustness and the best SBR obtained. The routine \noperating condition is robust and is applied to determination \nof major and trace elements in environmental samples with \ngood results. The best SBR condition was obtained when \na lower RF applied power of 1100 W was applied. An \nintermediate condition between these two sets of operating \nconditions was suggested to consider robustness and \nsensitivity simultaneously. When a RF power of 1250 W \nwas applied it is possible to obtain a semi-robust condition \nand intermediate values for SBR. \n\nIn ICP OES a measurement is based on the emission \nline intensity and this signal is composed of the net \nsignal and the background signal. These signals exhibit \ndifferent behaviors in face of changes in excitation and \n\nTable 4.

The behavior of the analytical \nsignals (gross signal and background) for the REEs using \nthe different sets of operating conditions were analyzed \napplying the emission line of La II 408.672 nm (Figure 4). \n\nThe samples analyzed consisted of a reference solution \ncontaining 1 mg L?1 of each REE, a blank solution and \na mixture of digests from geological samples spiked \nwith 1 mg L?1 of each REE. The pattern found for La II \n(408.672 nm) was also observed in others REEs emission \nlines. Considering the variation in the signal by reducing \nthe RF applied power (1350 -1100 W), it was also observed \nthat the background signal suffers more influence when \ndecreasing RF applied power. The analytical signal \nundergoes more change in Set 1 (1100 W), in fact it is a \nnon-robust condition. Analyzing the matrix spectra (digest \nfrom geological samples spiked with REEs) the effect of \ndecreasing the RF power was even more critical and the \nmatrix effects were more significant. \n\nSet 3 was considered a robust condition with lower \nSBR values and a considerable higher background \nsignal (ca. 8000 cps, Figure 4 - Set 3). The results of the \nintermediate condition (Set 2) were clear in the spectrum; \nthey displayed good sensitivity, low background emission \nand equivalent signals for reference and matrix solutions.\n\nTable 5 shows the behavior of the 3 sets of operating \nconditions based on the values of limit of detection (LOD), \nSBR, relative standard deviation for 10 measurements of \nthe blank solution (RSDblank), and recoveries (%) of REEs \nin reference solution (RS) and two certified reference \nmaterials,which were measured for the prominent lines \nconsidered in this work. The LOD was calculated using \nthe background equivalent concentration (BEC) approach \ndescribed by Thomsen et al.50 The lowest background \nintensity was obtained in Set 1 (Figure 4), being ca. 10-fold \nand 4-fold lower than Sets 3 and 2, respectively, and hence \nbetter SBR values. However, this condition shows a higher \nRSDblank and lower Mg II/Mg I ratio - non-robust condition \n(Table 4), thus this condition was not used. The robust \ncondition (1350 W) shows the highest LOD, the RSDblank is \nhigher than the Set 2 and the SBR value drops by half. The \nlimiting factor in Set 3 - robust condition - is the highest \nLOD that could difficult the analysis of some REEs due to \ntheir low relative abundances. Besides that the quantitative \nresults obtained for two certified reference materials does \nnot show significant improvements in recoveries when \ncomparing Set 2 and Set 3. Some interferences problems \nwere not overcome regardless of the robust or better \nSBR condition, for example Gd and Er. Consequently, \nalternative approaches need to be investigated (standard \nadditions method, internal standardization, mathematical \n\ncorrections, etc.). So a detailed study of interferences in \nterms of major constituents of geological samples is ongoing \nand results will be presented later. Thus considering LOD, \nbackground signal and the need for interference correction \nregardless of the condition (robust or better SBR), it was \nclear that an intermediate condition between the robustness \n(Mg II/Mg I) and sensitivity (SBR) would be a good choice \n\nFigure 4.

The \noptimization process was based on two different responses: \nMg II/Mg I line intensity ratio and SBR values, considering \nrobustness and sensitivity. Robustness is a quite common \nresponse function in ICP OES optimization studies. \nUsing different response functions for the optimization \nprocess of the operating conditions, such as robustness and \nsensitivity, the optimum conditions are not necessarily the \nsame. An analytical judgment may be necessary to select \nthe best operating conditions for complex samples. In the \ncase of the REEs, it is very important to recognize their \nbehavior in different conditions. Three different sets of \noperating conditions can be identified at first as: robust, \nsemi-robust and best SBR. The RF applied power is the \nmost critical parameter and lower applied power improved \nthe sensitivity as it leads to lower background signals that \ncan be crucial in trace analysis of complex matrices. A \npreliminary evaluation based on LOD, SBR and RSDblank \nindicates that the semi-robust condition is more suitable \nfor the determination of REEs by ICP OES. \n\nAcknowledgments\n\nFinancial support from Conselho Nacional de \nDesenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico (CNPq) and \nFunda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais \n(FAPEMIG \u2013 PPM-00433-10) is gratefully acknowledged. \nICP OES facilities were made available at the Laborat\u00f3rio \nde Geoqu\u00edmica (LGqA/DEGEO/UFOP) by Dr. Herm\u00ednio \nArias Nalini Junior.\n\nReferences\n\n 1.
