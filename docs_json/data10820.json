Surra affects a great variety of domestic \nand also wild mammals. In Brazil, the disease is also known as  mal de cadeiras  and \nis endemic in the Pantanal of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul states where it \naffects equines, capybaras, coatis and dogs (Stevens et al., 1989; Nunes &amp; Oshiro, 1990; \nNunes et al., 1993). Natural infections in dogs with manifestation of severe clinical \nsymptons have been reported in different regions of Brazil (Moreira &amp; Machado, 1985; \nFranke et al., 1994; Silva et al., 1995a). Surra in dogs is characterized by high morbity \nand mortality rates and anemia has been recorded as a consistent finding in naturally \ninfected dogs (Moreira &amp; Machado, 1985; Galhorta et al., 1986; Sandoval et al., 1994; \nSilva et al., 1995b) but its origin remains unclear and many hypothesis are proposed. \nThe leucogram of infected dogs seems not to show a defined trend; leucopenia with no \nchange in differencial count has been reported by some authors (Moreira &amp; Machado, \n1985; Silva et al., 1995b), while others registered no change in total white blood cell \ncount (Hellebrekers &amp; Slappendel, 1982; Sandoval et al., 1994). Some alterations in \nblood biochemistry, including hypoglucemia and decrease in albumin:globulin rate, \nwere verified in naturally infected dogs (Moreira &amp; Machado, 1985; Sandoval et al., \n1994). The main histophatological lesions described in dogs infected with T. evansi \nconsisted of mononuclear cells accumulations in the myocardium and \nmeningoencephalitis (May, 1968; Hellebrekers &amp; Slappendel, 1982). Despite the \nimportance and the worldwide distribution of  surra , very little is known about the \n\n\n\npathogenesis of this trypanosomiasis. Moreover, there are few reports about the disease \nin dogs great part of which refers to isolated cases of natural infection, what justifies \nadditional investigation. The present work was designed to study hematological, \nbiochemical and anatomopathological alterations in dogs experimentally infected with \nT. evansi.  \n\n  \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\nA cryopreserved strain of T. evansi originally isolated from a naturally infected dog by \nMoreira &amp; Machado (1985) was inoculated intravenously in a healthy 8-month-old \nmongrel dog. Blood with high parasitemia was used for infection of experimental \nanimals. \n\nEight male and female mongrel dogs about eight months of age were used. The animals \nwere raised in the kennel of the Department of Veterinary Pathology, FCAV-Unesp and \nkept in flyproof individual households. Dogs were fed a commercial ration and water \nwas available  ad libitum . Before inclusion in this study the animals were treated \nwith anthelmintics and immunized against infeccious diseases. Four dogs were \ninoculated intravenously each with 2.2 x 105 trypanosomes (T1, T2, T3 e T4) and four \nwere used as control (C1, C2, C3 e C4). \n\nBlood samples were collected from the jugular vein of all animals once a week from \nday 5 until day 82 of infection. Samples for hemogram were collected in tubes \ncontaining ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as anticoagulant and sodium \nfluoride for plasma glucose assays. Blood for serum used in other biochemical analyses \nwas collected without anticoagulant. Blood and serum samples were also obtained from \nall animals before experimental infection and considered as week 0 (mean of three \ncollections).  \n\nRed cell count (RBC), white cell count (WBC) and hemoglobin (Hb) concentration \nwere provided by an automated blood cell counter (CELM, Barueri SP) (CC-510) \nconnected to a hemoglobinometer1 (HB-520). The packed cell volume (PCV) was \ndetermined using the standard microhematocrit method. Mean corpuscular volume \n(MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were calculated \naccording to Ferreira Neto et al. (1981). \n\nSeric phosphatase alkaline, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase \n(AST), total bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, total protein and albumin as well as plasmatic \nglucose were determined by enzymatic colorimetric methods using commercial \navailable kits ( [1] LAB-TEST, Belo Horizonte MG). Serum globulin was recorded as \nthe difference between serum total protein and albumin. \n\nAfter 82 days of infection, the animals were euthanatized and submitted to necropsy. \nSamples from spleen, lymph nodes, heart, liver, lungs, brain, kidneys and gut were \ncollected and placed immediately in 10% buffered formalin. After fixation for 24 hours \nthe tissues were paraffin embedded, cut into 5\u00b5m sections and stained with hematoxilin \nand eosin (HE). \n\n\n\nData related to hemogram and biochemical assays were analysed using a simple split \nsplot design. Within each plot, the two experimental groups were allotted at random. \nThe times of infection were the subplots. \n\n  \n\nRESULTS \n\nInfected animals showed a significant decrease (P<0.01) in red blood cell count (RBC), \nhemoglobin concentration (Hb) and packed cell volume (PCV) mean values (Fig. 1). \nThere was a marked and progressive decrease in such values between weeks 0 and 4. \nThereafter they tended to stabilize, but remained bellow normal levels from week 3 until \nthe end of the experimental period. In the control group the mean values for these \nparameters were within normal range. A significant difference (P<0.01) was detected \nbetween the infected and control groups.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\nMCV and MCHC mean values fluctuated irregularly throughout the experimental \nperiod and no significant difference between the infected and control groups was \ndetected. MCV values in infected animals became above normal levels on weeks 4 and \n5, the same period when the lowest RBC values were registered, denoting a macrocytic \nnormocromic anemia. Despite a slight decrease at weeks 7, 9 and 11, MCHC values in \ninfected animals remained within normal ranges. \n\nMean absolute values for total white blood cell count (WBC) in infected group were \nsignificantly different from those of the control animals (P<0.05). Infection caused \nleucopenia between weeks 2 and 5 as consequence of a significant decrease (P<0.05) in \nneutrophils counts (Fig. 2a and 2b). Following this period, the mean values for WBC \nand neutrophils in infected group remained within normal ranges, but lower than in \ncontrol group until the end of the study. The mean absolute lymphocyte values in \n\n\n\ninfected dogs also showed a downward trend between weeks 2 and 5. Nevertheless, \nlymphocyte values remained within normal levels and there was no significant \ndifference between the groups. No significant changes were observed in basophils, \neosinophils and monocytes counts and no diferences were found between infected and \ncontrol groups. \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\nAST and ALT activity fluctuated irregularly in infected dogs and the mean values \nremained higher than those in control animals during most of the studied period. A \nsignificant difference was found in AST (P<0.01) and ALT (P<0.05) activity between \ncontrol and infected groups. AST values were above normal levels on weeks 4, 6 and 8 \nafter infection (Fig. 3b). Despite remaining within normal levels, ALT mean values \nfluctuated in infected animals and were higher than the values found in the control \nanimals for most of the experimental period (Fig. 3a). There was no significant \ndifference in alkaline phosphatase activity in control and infected dogs. In both groups \nalkaline phosphatase mean values remained within normal ranges.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\nBilirubin concentrations remained within normal levels in both infected and control \ngroups and no significant difference was found between them. However an increase in \ntotal bilirubin mean values due to a rise in indirect bilirubin was observed on week 4 in \ninfected animals (Fig. 3c). The mean glucose levels fluctuated considerably in both \ninfected and control groups, but remained within normal values, displaying no particular \ntrends. \n\nConcentrations of total protein in control animals mantained at a nearly constant value \nduring the infection, but in the infected dogs, total protein values rose significantly \n(P<0.05) throughout the experiment and was found above normal ranges from week 10 \n\n\n\nto 12 (Fig. 4a). A significant difference in total protein levels was found between \ncontrol and infected groups (P<0.01).  \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\nA significant increase in globulin (P<0.01) and a significant decrease in albumin \nconcentration (P<0.01) were observed in infected dogs. Infected animals showed \nhyperglobulinemia at weeks 4, 10, 11 and 12 after infection. Globulin and albumin \nconcentrations in infected group were significantly different (P<0.01) from controls \n(Fig. 4b and 4c). \n\n\n\nIn all infected dogs, necropsy showed nonspecific changes including emaciation, pale \nmucous membranes, enlarged and edematous lymph nodes and markedly enlarged \nspleens which on section displayed prominence of white pulp (Fig. 5). Lesions found in \nthe heart of three infected dogs consisted of pale areas in both right ventricles and \nauricles, the latter showing hemorragic areas (Fig. 6). One of the animals presented \nserous fluid accumulation in pericardic sac. \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\nPredominance of mononuclear cell infiltration of the myocardium affecting mainly right \nventricle and auricle and presence of degenerated cardiac fibers were observed in three \ninfected dogs. In some regions the infiltrates were more pronounced and a dense focal \n\n\n\ninfiltrate in a area of fibers destruction could be observed (Fig. 7). The spleens showed \nlymphoid hyperplasia of various degrees, scattered hemorrhagic areas and \nerythrophagocytosis. There was marked enlargement of lymphoid follicles with \npresence of mitotic cells in the lymph nodes. Proliferation of hystiocitic cells, \nplasmocytosis in medullar cords and a marked sinusal dilation with presence of edema \nwere evident. There was centrilobular fatty degeneration of various degrees and \nperiportal mononuclear cells accumulation in the liver. Lesions observed in the brain of \ntwo animals consisted of mononuclear cell accumulation in white and grey matter areas \nof cerebral cortex and also in cerebellae penducle. Some lesions displayed the aspect of \nglial nodule (Fig. 8) and moderated perivascular mononuclear cuffing was observed, \nusually nearby the infiltration areas. In addition, moderate to severe mononuclear cell \naccumulation was observed in the meninges of the cerebral cortex, especially in the \nsulcus and around meningeal vessels. \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\nNo significant changes were detected in the other organs examined. No trypanosome \nwere found in blood vessels or in the intersticial tissue in any organ. \n\n  \n\nDISCUSSION \n\nAnemia was a consistent finding as reported previously in different hosts infected with \nT. evansi (Jaktar &amp; Purohit, 1971; Oshiro et al., 1989; Monzon et al., 1991) including \ndogs (Hellebrekers &amp; Slappendel, 1982; Moreira &amp; Machado, 1985; Silva et al., 1995b). \nDespite being considered a significant pathological feature of the disease, the origin of \nthis anemia is not completely elucidated. Proposed mechanisms include hemolysis as a \nresult of erythrophagocytosis, hemodilution and depression of erythropoiesis. Increase \nin serum unconjugated bilirubin levels in infected animals occurred at week four after \ninoculation, coinciding with the lowest RBC values observed, suggesting the occurrence \nof an hemolytic crisis in this period of the infection. Hyperbilirubinemia has been \nreported in naturally infected dog as consequence of an increase in unconjugated \nbilirubin (Sandoval et al., 1994) and conjugated bilirubin (Hellebrekers &amp; Slappendel, \n1982). Increase in serum bilirubin levels was not a consistent finding during the \ninfection and did not exceed normal limits suggesting that extravascular destruction of \nred cells is a more likely explanation for anemia. Infected dogs showed leucopenia with \nneutropenia from week 2 until week 5 of the infection. Leucopenia (Moreira &amp; \nMachado, 1985) and normal leucograms (Hellebrekers &amp; Slappendel, 1982; Sandoval et \nal., 1994) have been reported in naturally infected dogs. The marked rise in AST levels, \ncompared to the rather modest increase in ALT observed in infected animals, indicate \nthat little of the former is derived from the liver. It is likely that the AST originated \nfrom heart muscle since myocarditis was found in three infected dogs. Increases in ALT \nand AST activity have been also observed in a T. evansi naturally infected dog \n(Sandoval et al., 1994). A significant increase in seric protein levels, as consequence of \nglobulin rise, and a parallel decrease in albumin concentrations were observed in \n\n\n\ninfected dogs. The decrease in albumin:globulin ratio has been frequently reported in T. \nevansi infection in various studied hosts (Jaktar et al., 1973; Boid et al., 1980; Moreira \n&amp; Machado, 1985; Galhorta et al., 1986; Monzon et al., 1991). It is suggestive that fall \nin albumin levels was secondary to hyperglobulinemia as a compensatory mechanism \nfor the maintenance of normal blood viscosity increased by high globulin levels. \nHypoalbuminemia as consequence of liver damage may be rejected since serum \nalbumin levels fall only after extensive and chronic liver malfunction, what was not a \nfeature in this experimental infection, as evidenced by liver function tests and \nanatomopathological findings. There is evidence to suggest that increase in \nimmunoglobulin levels was responsible for hyperglobulinemia observed in infected \ndogs. Study of electrophoretic patterns of serum proteins in T. evansi infected camels \n(Jaktar et al., 1973; Boid et al., 1980), equines (Raza et al., 1981) and cattle (Verma &amp; \nGautman, 1977) showed a marked increase in ?-globulin fraction.  \n\nGross examination of all infected dogs revealed lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly \nwhich, despite being always reported in T. evansi infection, are not pathognomonic for \nthe disease. Histological lesions in spleen and lymph nodes consisted of marked \nlymphoid hyperplasia and infiltrate of macrophages and histiocytes in the paracortical \nzone. According to Woodruff (1973) a progressive enlargement of spleen may occur \nwhen small amounts of antigen are released successively over a prolonged period, \nleading to a slight and continuous hemolysis. If red cells are coated with immune \ncomplexes or sensitized in some way, they are likely to be removed, at least in some \nmeasure, by the splenic reticuloendothelial tissue. Centrilobular fatty degeneration and \nperiportal accumulation were observed in all infected dogs. It is possible that \ndegenerative lesions resulted from anemia that developed in all infected animals. \nExperimental studies have suggested that centrilobular hepatic lesions result in less \nhyperbilirubinemia than when cells of the outer zone are damaged (Cornelius, 1989). \nThis fact is consistent with the almost unaltered bilirubin levels found in infected \nanimals.  \n\nMacroscopical lesions observed in the heart of three infected dogs could not be reported \nin the available bibliography. The histological lesions observed in myocardium of these \nanimals close resembled those described in trypanosomiasis caused by T. cruzi, \nalthough without the presence of the parasite. Similar lesion has been reported in a \nnaturally infected dog (Hellebrekers &amp; Slappendel, 1982) and in horses experimentally \ninfected with T. evansi (Marques, 1996). Non suppurative meningoencephalitis, similar \nto that found in two of the infected dogs, has been reported in naturally and \nexperimentally infected horses (Seiler et al., 1981; Ikede et al., 1983; Marques, 1996) \n\nand less frequently in naturally infected dogs (May, 1968; Hellebrekers &amp; Slappendel, \n1982). Microglial nodules, similar to those observed in two infected dogs, are very \ncommonly a feature of viral encephalitis, occuring in both gray and white matter, but \nare not specific for viral infections. Microglial response to tissue injury may be a \nproliferative reaction, although their ability to do so seems limited and many of the cells \nin proliferative foci are probably derived from imigrant histiocytes (Jubb &amp; Huxtable, \n1993).  \n\nThe aetiology of tissue lesions in animals infected with T. evansi is unknown. However, \nit is hypothesized that the deposition of immune complex in organs and body fluids is \nimportant and leads to the activation of Hageman factor and a cascade of enzymatic \nreactions resulting ultimately in the release of important pharmacologically active \n\n\n\nsubstances involved in the more chronic phases of the inflammatory response (Seed &amp; \nHall, 1985). It is clearly that a final explanation of the mechanisms of pathogenesis in \ntrypanosomiasis will be complex and obviously much more detailed investigation is \nneed. \n\n  \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nWe are gratefull to Eug\u00eanio de Campos Filho, Maria In\u00eas Y. de Campos, Francisca de \nAssis Ardison for their technical assistance and Ronaldo Del Vechio for the care of the \nanimals.  \n\n  \n\nREFERENCES  \n\nBOID, R.; LUCKINS, A.G.; GRAY, P.F. et al.
