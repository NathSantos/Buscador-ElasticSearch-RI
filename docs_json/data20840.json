Embora seja conhecido que os NSAIDs de aplica\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00f3pica s\u00e3o capazes de \n\npenetrar na pele humana, n\u00e3o existem estudos com humanos in vivo que mostrem a \n\nefici\u00eancia de penetra\u00e7\u00e3o e o percurso do medicamento at\u00e9 ao local de inflama\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nO in vivo tracking do medicamento deve ser efectuado por um m\u00e9todo eficaz e n\u00e3o \n\ninvasivo. A resson\u00e2ncia magn\u00e9tica (MRI) e espectroscopia por resson\u00e2ncia magn\u00e9tica \n\n(MRS) do fl\u00faor (\n19\n\nF) s\u00e3o de maior interesse para este prop\u00f3sito, dado que a MRI oferece \n\num excelente contraste de tecidos, elevada resolu\u00e7\u00e3o espacial e temporal e, a aus\u00eancia de \n\nfl\u00faor nos tecidos biol\u00f3gicos faz do n\u00facleo deste \u00e1tomo um probe ideal para fazer tracking e \n\nquantifica\u00e7\u00e3o in vivo de NSAIDs que contenham fl\u00faor. \n\nA baixa resolu\u00e7\u00e3o espacial e temporal de \n19\n\nF MRI/MRS, devido a baixas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ndeste \u00e1tomo nas regi\u00f5es de interesse, pode ser aumentada nos campos magn\u00e9ticos ultra \n\nelevados (UHF) pelo aumento da raz\u00e3o sinal-ru\u00eddo (SNR) que acompanha o aumento da \n\nintensidade do campo do magneto est\u00e1tico. Por\u00e9m, o aumento do campo magn\u00e9tico acarreta \n\ndesvantagens como o aumento da n\u00e3o homogeneidade do campo de excita\u00e7\u00e3o   \n  e da \n\nabsor\u00e7\u00e3o da energia de radio frequ\u00eancia (RF), que causa o aquecimento indesej\u00e1vel dos \n\ntecidos. RF array coils de superficie com um design ideal e com os par\u00e2metros RF \n\nrefinados podem usufruir da elevada SNR de UHF e, ao mesmo tempo reduzir a n\u00e3o \n\nhomogeneidade do   \n  e evitar a elevada deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de energia de RF de modo a que esta \n\nn\u00e3o exceda os limites de taxa de absor\u00e7\u00e3o espec\u00edfica (SAR). \n\nNeste projecto foi desenvolvida uma coil de superf\u00edcie de frequ\u00eancia dual (\n1\nH e \n\n19\nF) para \n\nregisto de imagens anat\u00f3micas com prot\u00f5es, assim como de imagens e espectroscopia de \n\nfl\u00faor no tracking e quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o deste \u00e1tomo num creme de NSAID com fl\u00faor (\u00e1cido \n\nflufen\u00e2mico) num joelho humano a 7.0 Tesla.  \n\nA coil constru\u00edda consiste em tr\u00eas partes, contendo quatro canais de prot\u00e3o e quatro canais \n\nde fl\u00faor, que abrangem toda a \u00e1rea de interesse. As duas partes anteriores, com dois canais \n\n\n\nii \n\n \n\nde fl\u00faor e um de prot\u00e3o cada, cobrem a parte anterior do joelho, onde o creme de NSAID \u00e9 \n\naplicado. A parte posterior, formada por dois canais de prot\u00e3o, \u00e9 curvada convexamente \n\npara suportar confortavelmente o joelho durante os exames de MRI. \n\nO circuito do condutor da coil foi imprimido numa folha de cobre atrav\u00e9s de um sistema de \n\ncontrolo num\u00e9rico por computador. V\u00e1rios condensadores foram soldados ao longo do \n\ncondutor de modo a diminuir o seu comprimento, assim s\u00e3o evitadas as fases zero da onda \n\nsinusoidal, onde n\u00e3o h\u00e1 sinal, na medida em que o comprimento de onda em 7.0 T \u00e9 \n\naproximadamente o comprimento dos condutores. Foram colocados condensadores \n\najust\u00e1veis nos locais de circuito reservados ao tuning, matching e decoupling dos elementos \n\nda coil. Desde modo, a coil pode ser ajustada a diferentes loads (fantomas ou humanos) \n\nconforme o necess\u00e1rio. Al\u00e9m disso, ainda foram colocadas cable traps nos cabos de \n\nalimenta\u00e7\u00e3o de cada canal, para evitar as correntes inst\u00e1veis dos respectivos cabos que \n\npodem influenciar a performance da coil. \n\nA performance da coil foi avaliada atrav\u00e9s de S-parameters, mais especificamente atrav\u00e9s \n\ndo coeficiente de reflex\u00e3o (Sii), que indica a por\u00e7\u00e3o da energia que \u00e9 reflectida quando ela \u00e9 \n\nimposta no canal i, e atrav\u00e9s do coeficiente de transmiss\u00e3o (Sij), que indica que por\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nenergia imposta no canal i \u00e9 transmitida e perdida para o canal j. Os resultados obtidos \n\nmostraram que os coeficientes de reflex\u00e3o de todos os canais se encontravam abaixo de  \n\n-30 dB, ou seja, na pior das hip\u00f3teses, apenas 0.1% da energia emitida para um canal \u00e9 \n\nreflectida para tr\u00e1s, o que mostra que quase toda a energia \u00e9 recebida pelos canais para \n\nproduzir o campo de excita\u00e7\u00e3o   \n . Os coeficientes de transmiss\u00e3o variavam entre -16 dB a \n\n-25 dB, revelando que as perdas de energia de um canal para outro podem de ser at\u00e9 2.5%, \n\nou seja, a perda n\u00e3o \u00e9 significativa.  \n\nO factor Q tamb\u00e9m foi medido para verificar a performance da coil. A raz\u00e3o entre Q com \n\nload e Q sem load de todos os canais apresentou-se menor que 0.5. Este resultado mostra \n\nque o ru\u00eddo vem maioritariamente do load e n\u00e3o do circuito da coil em si, o que \u00e9 desej\u00e1vel, \n\numa vez que nestas condi\u00e7\u00f5es uma melhor raz\u00e3o sinal-ru\u00eddo pode ser obtida. \n\nA intensidade e a fase dos campos de radiofrequ\u00eancia variam dentro do objecto conforme a \n\nsua forma, permitividade e condutividade el\u00e9ctricas. Em campos maiores que 3.0 T, o \n\n\n\niii \n\n \n\ncomportamento das ondas electromagn\u00e9ticas torna-se dif\u00edcil de prever com m\u00e9todos \n\nsimples e qu\u00e1si-est\u00e1ticos, tanto que \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio recorrer \u00e0 simula\u00e7\u00e3o completa de campos \n\nelectromagn\u00e9ticos. As simula\u00e7\u00f5es oferecem um conhecimento antecipado do \n\ncomportamento de   \n , assim como da deposi\u00e7\u00e3o da energia RF nos tecidos, que \u00e9 mais \n\nelevada nos campos magn\u00e9ticos ultra elevados, como no caso de 7.0 T. Deste modo, o \n\nsobreaquecimento dos tecidos pode ser previamente visualizada e evitada. \n\nNeste projecto, as simula\u00e7\u00f5es foram efectuadas com o software SEMCAD X que se baseia \n\nno m\u00e9todo das diferen\u00e7as finitas no dom\u00ednio temporal (FDTD) para resolver as equa\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ndiferenciais de Maxwell.  \n\nDe forma a mostrar a credibilidade das simula\u00e7\u00f5es, uma simula\u00e7\u00e3o da coil com um fantoma \n\nfoi efectuada de modo a obter mapas de   \n , usados para comparar os mapas de   \n\n  obtidos \n\nexperimentalmente. Como resultado, os mapas simulados e medidos apresentavam uma \n\nsemelhan\u00e7a significativa em termos qualitativos. Ao n\u00edvel quantitativo, estes apresentavam \n\numa diferen\u00e7a de 21.5 \u00b1 7.6% para os canais de prot\u00e3o e de 47.8 \u00b1 9.2% para os canais de \n\nfl\u00faor, apesar das correc\u00e7\u00f5es de perdas de energia em hardware nas medi\u00e7\u00f5es. A diferen\u00e7a \n\nquantitativa nos canais de prot\u00e3o pode dever-se a perdas extras desconhecidas no scanner. \n\nA significativa diferen\u00e7a presente nos canais de fl\u00faor pode ser explicada pelo facto dos \n\nmapas experimentais serem obtidos na frequ\u00eancia de prot\u00e3o e extrapolados atrav\u00e9s dos S-\n\nparameters, uma vez que n\u00e3o existia nenhum fantoma que contivesse fl\u00faor no momento da \n\nexperi\u00eancia. Adicionalmente, os S-parameters foram adquiridos fora do scanner, sendo por \n\nisso apenas uma aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o dos S-parameters reais durante as medi\u00e7\u00f5es. Contudo, pode \n\nafirmar-se que a valida\u00e7\u00e3o das simula\u00e7\u00f5es \u00e9 cred\u00edvel pela significativa semelhan\u00e7a \n\nqualitativa dos mapas em todos os canais, e da semelhan\u00e7a quantitativa entre os canais de \n\nprot\u00e3o. \n\nOs valores de SAR m\u00e9dio de 10 g, obtidos por simula\u00e7\u00e3o para as configura\u00e7\u00f5es de fase 3 \n\nutilizadas nos scans reais, foram encontrados como sendo 0.306 W/kg para a frequ\u00eancia de \n\nfl\u00faor (279.5 MHz) e 0.375 W/kg para a frequ\u00eancia de prot\u00e3o (297.0 MHz). Estes valores \n\nencontram-se muito abaixo do limite estabelecido pelas directrizes da IEC, 20.0 W/kg para \n\nas extremidades do corpo. \u00c9 de notar tamb\u00e9m que, os valores de SAR obtidos pela \n\n\n\niv \n\n \n\nsimula\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o t\u00eam em conta as perdas de energia existentes na realidade, por isso, num \n\nscan real, o valor de SAR n\u00e3o iria exceder os valores simulados. \n\nOs valores de T1 e T2 para o creme de NSAID com \u00e1cido flufen\u00e2mico a usar nas \n\nexperi\u00eancias in vivo foram encontrados atrav\u00e9s de espectroscopia, atrav\u00e9s da varia\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nTR para o T1 e de TE para o T2. Foi tamb\u00e9m elaborada uma curva de concentra\u00e7\u00e3o, onde \n\npara cada quantidade de creme de NSAID existe a correspondente intensidade de sinal.  \n\nAs imagens de resson\u00e2ncia obtidas com a coil constru\u00edda mostram um bom contraste e \n\nhomogeneidade na \u00e1rea de interesse. A homogeneidade foi conseguida por uma sess\u00e3o de \n\n  \n  shimming in vivo. A resolu\u00e7\u00e3o espacial foi de 0.7 \u00d7 0.7 mm\n\n2\n no plano e 5 mm para a \n\nespessura de fatia para imagens de prot\u00e3o e, de 2 \u00d7 2 mm\n2\n no plano e 5 mm para a \n\nespessura de fatia para imagens de fl\u00faor. \n\nOs estudos in vivo foram conduzidos em dois volunt\u00e1rios saud\u00e1veis, na aus\u00eancia de \n\nvolunt\u00e1rios com reumat\u00f3ide artrite. Os volunt\u00e1rios aplicaram o creme que cont\u00e9m NSAID \n\nsobre o joelho. Foram efectuadas espectroscopias n\u00e3o-localizadas a intervalos regulares de \n\nmodo a verificar a exist\u00eancia da altera\u00e7\u00e3o do sinal inicial que pudesse indicar a absor\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\ncreme na pele. Os resultados, por\u00e9m, n\u00e3o se mostraram conclusivos, uma vez que a \n\nespectroscopia efectuada abrangia as regi\u00f5es no exterior e no interior do corpo. Foi \n\nefectuada, adicionalmente, uma espectroscopia localizada com o m\u00e9todo SPECIAL dentro \n\ndo joelho de um dos volunt\u00e1rios, ap\u00f3s 172 minutos do primeiro scan, contudo nenhum sinal \n\nfoi detectado. A inexist\u00eancia do sinal pode dever-se \u00e0 n\u00e3o penetra\u00e7\u00e3o do creme na regi\u00e3o \n\nonde o voxel SPECIAL foi colocado, ou contrariamente, ter ocorrido a penetra\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\ncreme mas numa quantidade demasiada baixa para poder ser detectada. \n\nNos trabalhos futuros, devem-se ser inclu\u00eddos outros m\u00e9todos para detec\u00e7\u00e3o do creme de \n\nNSAID in vivo com a coil desenvolvida, como espectroscopias localizadas dentro e fora do \n\njoelho, com tempos mais longos de scan, e com pacientes que tenham reumat\u00f3ide artrite e \n\nvolunt\u00e1rios saud\u00e1veis, de modo a comparar a efici\u00eancia da absor\u00e7\u00e3o do medicamento. \n\nPalavras chave: MRI, campos magn\u00e9ticos ultra elevados, RF coil, array coil de suferf\u00edcie, \n\nRF coil de dual frequ\u00eancia, imagiologia de \n19\n\nF, espectroscopia de \n19\n\nF, simula\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\ncampos EM, SAR, Artrite Reumat\u00f3ide, NSAIDs.  \n\n\n\nv \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\nTopical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been introduced to treat \n\nrheumatoid arthritis condition in order to avoid side effects from its oral form. Although it \n\nis known that topical NSAIDs are able to penetrate the human skin, no human in vivo \n\nstudies were carried out to show the penetration efficiency and the drug delivering path at \n\nthe site of inflammation.   \n\nIn vivo drug tracking should be carried out by a non-invasive and effective method. A good \n\ncandidate is fluorine (\n19\n\nF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS), \n\nsince MRI offers excellent tissue contrast and high spatial and temporal resolutions. The \n\nabsence of fluorine in biological tissue makes it an ideal probe to track and quantify \n\nfluorine containing NSAIDs in vivo.  \n\nIn this project, a dedicated \n1\nH/\n\n19\nF dual tuned surface coil with eight channels was \n\nconstructed to register proton anatomical images and fluorine images/spectroscopy to track \n\nand quantify a fluorine containing NSAID ointment in human knee at 7.0 tesla. The \n\nconstructed coil showed low reflection and transmission coefficients (<-30 dB and&lt;-16 dB \n\nrespectively) and noise dominant Q ratio, which enounces SNR gain. \n\nElectromagnetic field (EMF) simulations were carried out to visualize RF field patterns and \n\nSAR values for safety. Comparison between simulated and measured   \n  maps showed \n\nreasonable qualitative and quantitative agreement, validating the SAR simulations, which \n\ngive an estimation of the deposited RF power in the tissue in a real MRI scan. \n\nIn vivo \n19\n\nF spectroscopy, aimed to observe and quantify the skin absorption of flufenamic \n\nacid contained NSAID, showed inconclusive results. The spectroscopy performed with a \n\nSPECIAL voxel placed inside the knee did not show any fluorine signal, either due to non-\n\nabsorption of the NSAID or the absorbed quantity was too low to be detected. Further \n\nimproved in vivo experiments should be carried out with RA patients. \n\nKeywords: MRI, ultrahigh magnetic field, surface array RF coil, dual tuned RF coil, \n19\n\nF \n\nimaging, \n19\n\nF spectroscopy, EMF simulations, SAR, Rheumatoid Arthritis, NSAIDs. \n\n\n\nvi \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS   \n \n\nThis thesis would not have been possible without the help of many people and here I would \n\nlike to express my gratitude.  \n\nFirst of all, I would like to express my gratitude to Professor Thoralf Niendorf and Dr. \n\nSonia Waiczies for the opportunity to work at Berlin Ultrahigh Field Facility (B.U.F.F.), \n\nMax-Delbr\u00fcck Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC), Berlin, Germany and especially for \n\ntheir encouragement, guidance and support. \n\nI would like to thank Dr. Helmar Waiczies, who have been closely supervising my work.

INTRODUCTION \n \n\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that causes long-term joints and \n\nsurrounding tissues inflammation. It affects usually joints on both sides of the body equally. \n\nWrists, fingers, knees, feet, and ankles are the most commonly affected, though it can also \n\naffect another body parts such as eyes, mouth and lungs [1].  \n\nRA treatment includes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are known \n\nfor their anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antipyretic and antithrombotic effects [2]. Despite \n\ntheir beneficial proprieties for RA, conventional oral form of NSAIDs present side effects \n\nsuch as irritation and bleeding of gastrointestinal mucosa, heart burn and nausea, thus  \n\ntopical NSAIDs were introduced as an alternative to avoid these side effects and also to \n\nminimize the overall required dosage [3].  \n\nHowever, to be effective, topical NSAIDs have to penetrate the skin and reach the joints in \n\na sufficient concentration. Although many studies have shown overall therapeutic active \n\neffects of topical NSAIDs [4\u20137] and effective skin penetration [8,9] it is still not shown \n\nhow nor how much of the drug reaches the site of inflammation to exert their therapeutic \n\neffect. This in vivo drug tracking should be carried out by a non-invasive and effective \n\nmethod, and fluorine (\n19\n\nF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) are \n\nof major interest. \n\nMRI provides an excellent tissue contrast and high spatial and temporal resolutions, and the \n\nfluorine with a high gyromagnetic ratio and high signal sensitivity, about 83% of \n\nhydrogen\u2019s; together with its absence background in biological tissue [10] form an ideal \n\nprobe to track and quantify NSAIDs in vivo. MRI at ultrahigh fields (7.0 T) benefits from \n\nthe increased signal to noise ratio (SNR) which can be translated into higher spatial and \n\ntemporal resolutions [11], which is of high interest of \n19\n\nF MRI and MRS due to low \n\nconcentration of fluorine nuclei in region of interest [12].  \n\nBut on the other hand, higher fields lead to more   \n  excitation field inhomogeneities and to \n\nmore radio frequency (RF) power absorption, which can cause undesirable tissue heating \n\n[13]. RF surface array coils with an optimum design and refined RF parameters can get use \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\nof the high SNR of the ultrahigh magnetic fields and at same time reduces the   \n  non-\n\nhomogeneities and avoid high RF power absorption in order to stay within the limits of \n\nspecific absorption rate (SAR). This limits are established by authority entities such as \n\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) and International Electrotechnical Commission \n\n(IEC), concerning patient safety [14,15].  \n\nTypical approach for \n19\n\nF studies combines proton images containing anatomical \n\ninformation and fluorine images that contain study aimed information. This can be \n\nperformed either by a single tuned RF coil, which can have a sufficient bandwidth to \n\naccommodate both nuclei or a smaller bandwidth that needs to be constantly tuned and \n\nmatched between \n1\nH and \n\n19\nF frequencies, or by a dual tuned RF coil tuned and matched to \n\nboth frequencies. Dual tuned RF coils are preferred rather than single tuned coils, since a \n\nlarge bandwidth needed to cover both frequencies of the later ones leads to significant noise \n\nincrease and signal sensitivity drop, or in the other case, the constant manipulation between \n\nfrequencies can change image registration between one nuclei scan to the other, besides, the \n\nsensitivity profile also varies from one frequency to the other [16]. \n\n \n\n1.1. Objective \n \n\nThe purpose of the present thesis is to develop a dual tuned array coil for proton and \n\nfluorine magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy at 7.0 T for human knee. The \n\ndeveloped coil will be used to register \n1\nH anatomical images and \n\n19\nF images and \n\nspectroscopy to track and quantify a fluorine containing NSAID ointment (flufenamic acid \n\n(2-{[3-(Trifluoromethyl) phenyl]amino}benzoic acid) in vivo. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\n2. BACKGROUND \n\n2.1. Basics of Magnetic Resonance Imaging \n \n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a relatively recent medical imaging modality as its \n\nfirst practical medical application was performed in 1973 [17]. It has shown to be a \n\npowerful imaging modality due to its flexibility and sensitivity to a wide range of tissue \n\nproperties and most importantly to the noninvasive nature of the magnetic fields. MRI is \n\nbased on the principle of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) [18], which is explained \n\nbelow.  \n\n \n\n2.1.1. The Nuclear Spin \n \n\nNuclear Magnetic resonance is based upon the interaction between an applied external \n\nmagnetic field and atoms that possess nuclear magnetic moment, or more generally referred \n\nas nuclear spin [15].   \n\nProtons and neutrons of nucleus possess intrinsic angular momentum as they rotate around \n\nan axis at constant rate. In classical-physics view, protons and neutrons can be regarded as \n\nrotating mass with charge, therefore giving rise to a magnetic moment which behaves like \n\nsmall magnets (Figure 1). A neutron has no net charge but it is composed of charged \n\nparticles (two down-Quarks and one up-Quark) possessing an intrinsic spin of 1/2 and \n\ntherefore belongs to the group of Fermions, like the protons [19,20]. \n\n                                 \n \nFigure 1 - A: A rotating proton or neutron can classically be represented with a dipole magnetic \n\nfield. B: The magnetic moment vector indicates direction and magnitude of the magnetic field \n\ninduced by a spinning proton or neutron and behaves like a small magnet. Adapted from [21]. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nPairing phenomenon occurs within the nucleus, where the magnetic moments of proton-\n\nproton or neutron-neutron pairs tend to align in opposition canceling each other. Thus, \n\nnuclear spin can be zero if the nucleus has an even number of protons and neutrons which \n\npair up, resulting in a zero net magnetic moment. Such nucleus does not interact with an \n\nexternal magnetic field. On the other hand, nuclear spin can be multiples of 1/2 if a nucleus \n\nhas an odd number of protons or neutrons, in this case there are unpaired protons or \n\nneutrons that produce a non-zero net magnetic moment, and therefore  this nucleus will \n\ninteract with an external field [19,21,22]. Almost all atoms have at least one naturally \n\noccurring isotope that possesses spin, therefore nearly every element is examinable in MRI \n\n[15].  \n\nAn important physical quantity for MRI is the ratio of the magnetic moment to the angular \n\nmomentum, called gyromagnetic ratio ( ) [19]. Table 1 shows information about spin, \n\ngyromagnetic ratio, isotropic composition and abundance in biological tissues of some \n\nselected elements of the MRI interest. It is also notable that hydrogen has a very high \n\nconcentration in the body, due to its presence in water, fat and other organic molecules, and \n\na relatively high gyromagnetic ratio, which makes these nuclei, composed only by a single \n\nproton, the source of signal for nearly all clinical MRI exams. This fact leads to the general \n\ndescription of MRI effects made with term \u201cproton\u201d (also used in the next sections of this \n\nwork), although these effects are same for other nuclei [19].  \n\nElement Symbol Net Spin \n  \n\n(MHz/T) \n\nNatural \n\nabundance \n\nBiological \n\nabundance \n\nHydrogen \n\n1\nH \u00bd 42.58 0.99985 \n\n0.63 \n2\nH 1 6.54 0.00015 \n\nFluorine \n19\n\nF \u00bd 40.08 1 0.00001 \n\nCarbon \n\n13\nC \u00bd 10.71 0.11 \n\n0.094 \n12\n\nC 0 0 0.89 \n\nSodium \n23\n\nNa 3/2 11.27 1 0.00041 \n\nPhosphorus \n31\n\nP \u00bd 17.25 1 0.0024 \n\nTable 1 - Spin, gyromagnetic ratio ( ), isotopic composition and abundance in biological tissues of \n\nsome elements of MR interest. Adapted from [22,23]. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\n2.1.2. Protons in a Static Magnetic Field \n \n\nWithout an external magnetic field, protons spins in random directions, which results in a \n\nnull net magnetic moment, also called net magnetization  ??? , illustrated in Figure 2 A. On \n\nthe other hand, when the protons are placed inside a static magnetic field  ??  , they \n\nexperience two quantized energy states (2 \u00d7 spin + 1) with energy difference of   , which \n\nis proportional to external magnetic strength. Protons in the lower energy level, called spin \n\nup, align parallel to  ??   (conventionally set as z direction) and protons in the higher energy \n\nlevel, called spin down, align antiparallel to  ??  , as shown in Figure 2 B.  At thermal \n\nequilibrium state a number of protons in higher energy state transits to lower energy state \n\nby exchanging energy with their surroundings, and vice versa, but the mean number of \n\nprotons in each energy state remains constant. The parallel alignment cancels out the \n\nantiparallel alignment, and as there are more protons in the lower energy state than in the \n\nhigher energy state, the excess of parallel alignment results in a measurable net \n\nmagnetization vector  ???   aligned with  ??   which is called thermal-equilibrium magnitization \n\n[19,21].  ???   increases proportionally with   , and the MRI signal is directly proportional to \n\n ???  . This increase of signal with increase of    explains one of the motivations for \n\ndevelopment of higher magnetic field systems [19]. \n\n \n\n                     \n\nFigure 2 \u2013 A: in absence of an external magnetic field, nuclei spins are in random directions, \n\nresulting in a zero net magnetization.  B: in presence of an external magnetic field  ??  , protons \n\nalign parallel (lower energy state) or antiparallel (higher energy state) to the  ??  , the excess of \n\nparallel alignment results in a measurable net magnetization. Adapted from [21]. \n\n \n\n ???   \n\n ???    \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nBesides magnetic alignment, an external magnetic field exerts a torque on the magnetic \n\nmoment causing the proton to precess around z direction, as shown in Figure 3. The \n\nfrequency of precession, also known as the Larmor frequency (?0), is proportional to the \n\nstrength of  ??   and is influenced by gyromagnetic ratio of the element. It is described by \n\nLarmor equation (Eq. 1) [15,19]: \n\n \n\n        Eq. 1 \n\n \n\n   \n\n \nFigure 3 - Precession of a nuclear magnetic moment ( ?? ) about an externally applied magnetic field \n\nwith  ??   with angular frequency of ?0 [19]. \n\n \n\n2.1.3. Magnetic Resonance Signal \n \n\nExcitation of the spins \n\nAt equilibrium, the longitudinal magnetization (aligned with  ??  ) of  ???   is maximal and is \n\ndenoted as  ???  . However, compared to the strength of   ???? ,  ???   (in order of ?T) is too small, \n\nmaking it impossible to be directly detected. Therefore, it is necessary to tip  ???   into the \n\ntransversal xy plane in order to gain a measurable signal [21]. \n\nTo tip the thermal-equilibrium magnetization vector  ???  , it is necessary to disturb the \n\nequilibrium state of the protons. This can be done by an additional time-varying magnetic \n\nfield perpendicular to  ??  , called  ??  , through application of a radiofrequency (RF) excitation \n\npulse at Larmor frequency on a transmit (Tx) RF coil. The generated  ??   consists of two \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\ncircular polarized fields:  ??  \n , which can excite the spin as it has the same sense of rotation \n\nas the precessing spins, and  ??  \n , which has an opposite direction of rotation and does not \n\ncontribute for excitation, however it is decisive for signal reception.  \n\nNow  ???  (called  ???  instead of  ???   once the system is no longer in equilibrium state) has to \n\nprecess about  ??   while continuing to precess at the same time about  ??  , as result, in a \n\nstationary frame (x y z)  ???  will spiral towards xy plane as shown in Figure 4 A. In a rotating \n\nframe (xrot yrot zrot), where zrot (parallel to  ??  ) is the axis of rotation, while xrot and yrot axes \n\nrotates at the Larmor frequency,  ???  will tip at an angle, the flip angle ?, about xrot and a \n\ntransversal component of net magnetization  ??? ,  ???   , is originated, as can be observed in \n\nFigure 4 B [15,24].  \n\n                          \n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Behavior of the net magnetization vector  ???  in presence of a circular polarized and \n\nperpendicular to  ??   magnetic field   ??   in A) a stationery frame and on B) a rotational frame. [19] \n\n \n\nThe flip angle ? depends on the gyromagnetic ratio ( ), the strength of  ??   and on the \n\nduration   of the RF field, as described by the following equation [19]: \n\n        Eq. 2 \n \n\nBy an appropriate choice of    and   any flip angle ? can be obtained. A 90\u00ba flip angle is \n\ncaused by a 90\u00ba pulse, also called an excitation pulse, and moves the net magnetization \n\nfrom longitudinal axis into transverse plane. The RF pulse also induces phase coherence to \n\nall individual spins, that is why the net magnetization vector can have a transverse \n\ncomponent in non-equilibrium conditions [17]. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nRelaxation \n\nWhen the RF pulse is turned off,  ??   vanishes and the relaxation occurs as the protons \n\nreturns to equilibrium state. This process is called free induction decay (FID).  The \n\nrelaxation can be divided into spin-lattice relaxation and spin-spin relaxation. In the first \n\none, the longitudinal component of  ???  becomes  ???   again, and in the latter one, the \n\ntransverse component of  ???  returns to zero [17], as shown in Figure 5. \n\n \nFigure 5 \u2013 schematic overview of free induction decay process. The RF pulse creates a net \n\ntransverse magnetization due to energy absorption and phase coherence. After RF pulse, spin-\n\nlattice and spin-spin relaxations occur [17]. \n\n \n\nSpin-lattice relaxation  \n\nIn the absence of  ??  , the previous excited protons, in order to return to the lowest energy \n\nstate, tends to re-align their magnetic moment to  ??  . Therefore the longitudinal component \n\nof  ???  becomes maximum again, thus the spin-lattice relaxation is also called longitudinal \n\nrelaxation. The energy difference is transferred to the lattice of nearby atoms and is \n\ntransformed into heat. The process of this relaxation can be described by follow equation. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\n   ( )    (   )     \n        (   \n\n     ) Eq. 3 \n\nwhere   ( ) is the longitudinal component of net magnetization vector  ??? ( ),   (  \n\n )     is the value of longitudinal component immediately after RF pulse and    is the \n\nspin-lattice relaxation time \u2013 the time taken for the net magnetization to recover to 63% of \n\n   or   (   \n  )  \u2013 which differs from tissue to tissue and increases with the strength of \n\n ??   [11,17]. \n\n \n\nSpin-spin relaxation  \n\nPhysically, each spin vector experiences a slightly different magnetic field because of the \n\ndifferent chemical environment. As a result of these spin\u2013spin interactions, the spins rotate \n\nat slightly differing angular frequencies, which results in a loss of the phase coherence and \n\na decrease of the transverse component    ( ). This spin-spin relaxation, also called \n\ntransversal relaxation, is described by \n\n    ( )     (   )     \n      Eq. 4 \n\nwhere    (   )     is the value of the transverse component immediately after the RF \n\npulse, and     \u2013  the spin-spin relaxation time \u2013 takes place when    ( ) has decayed to 37%  \n\nof its original value or    (   ) \n   and it depends considerably on the tissue.  In this \n\nmechanism of dephasing, no energy is lost, but since it also includes the spin-lattice \n\ninteraction related to   ,    has to be shorter than   , and it is rather independent of    \n\n[11,17]. \n\n   \nFigure 6 \u2013 A: The longitudinal relaxation and relaxation time T1.

[8] \n\n      \n\nA B \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nThe longitudinal and transversal relaxations are illustrated in Figure 6, with their \n\ncorrespondent relaxation times. \n\nThere is an additional dephasing caused by  ??   inhomogeneities which contributes to an \n\neven faster signal decay. This type of decay occurs with the time constant T2\n*\n, typically \n\nshorter than T2 [20]. \n\n \n\nSignal reception \n\n \n\nBy placing a receive (Rx) RF coil near to the sample, the precessing transversal \n\nmagnetization     ( ) will induce an alternating voltage at the ends of the loop due to \n\nFaraday's Law of induction. The intensity of the detected signal is connected to the \n\nmagnetic field of the loop via the principle of reciprocity [25,26]. \n\nAfter its detection, the signal is first amplified and then mixed with a frequency ?, which \n\nslightly differs from Larmor frequency. After the demodulation, the signal is sampled by an \n\nAnalogue-Digital-Converter (ADC) and finally transferred to the computer for post-\n\nprocessing, as illustrated in Figure 7 [18]. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 7 \u2013 Block diagram of the signal processing chain in an NMR experiment with PA being the \n\npower amplifier, M the mixer for demodulation and ADC the Analogue-Digital-Converter [18]. \n\n \n\n \n\nR\nx\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\n2.1.4. Magnetic Resonance Imaging \n \n\nMagnetic resonance imaging is based on determination of spatial location of NMR signals \n\nto create an image. This is possible by introduction of magnetic field gradients that produce \n\na small variation on the strength of the main magnetic field  ??   [15]. \n\n \n\nMagnetic Field Gradients \n\nMagnetic field gradients consist of three magnetic fields that add or subtract a small amount \n\nof field strength from the main static magnetic field  ??  , linearly proportional to the distance \n\nfrom the isocenter in x, y and z direction. This spatial variation of the strength of  ??   results \n\non different Larmor frequencies on protons located at different positions along the applied \n\ngradient in a known way, as shown in Figure 8 [19]. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8 \u2013 Total magnetic field strength along position when a magnetic gradient field is applied to \n\nthe main static field. This variation causes protons in different positions to spin at different but \n\nknown Larmor frequencies [21]. \n\n \n\nSlice Selection \n\nThe first step to acquire a MRI image is the slice selection. The slice-select gradient (GSS) \n\ncreates a linear correspondence between the Larmor frequency and the position, a desired \n\nslice can be obtained by applying an RF pulse with selected center frequency (? ), thus, \n\nonly the protons in the position corresponded to center frequency (  ), called slice position, \n\ncan be excited, as shown in Figure 9 [19]. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9 \u2013 An illustration of slice selection [19]. \n\n \n\nSpatial encoding \n\n \n\nAfter the slice selection, e.g., in z direction, all the protons within the slice precess at same \n\nfrequency. To obtain an image from it, it is necessary to proceed spatial encoding. Spatial \n\nencoding comprises two steps, phase encoding and frequency encoding [20,24]. \n\nFor phase encoding, a gradient in y direction is switched on immediately after the RF pulse \n\nof the slice selection and before the signal acquisition. This gradient modifies the Larmor \n\nfrequency of the protons along y direction (Figure 10 A). As result, the protons in a higher \n\nfield strength gain phase relative to the protons in a lower field strength. In this way, each \n\nline of protons within the slice can be identified by its unique phase.  \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nFor frequency encoding, a frequency-enconding gradient is applied in x direction during \n\nacquisition time. This gradient causes different Larmor frequencies of the protons along x-\n\naxis, thus each column of protons within the slice can be characterized by its specific \n\nfrequency (Figure 10 B).  \n\nIn this way, each volume element (voxel) of the slice will have unique frequency and phase \n\nallowing its spatial identification. \n\n \n\n      \n \n\nFigure 10 \u2013 Spatial encoding. A: Phase encoding \u2013 a y-gradient causes unique phase shifts within \n\nlines of the selected slice. B: Frequency enconding \u2013 an x-gradient causes specific Larmor \n\nfrequencies within columns of the selected slice. [20] \n\n \n\n \n\nK-space  \n \n\nK-space is where the collected encoded data from the MR signals are stored, corresponding \n\nto the inverse Fourier transform of the image space. It has two axes, the horizontal axis kx \n\nstores the frequency information, and the vertical axis ky stores the information about the \n\nphase. Each k-space line corresponds to one measurement and it is acquired for each phase-\n\nencoding step. An MR image is created from raw data by application of 2D Fourier \n\ntransform after the scan is over and k-space is filled.  \n\nK-space lines do not correspond to the resulting image lines. Rather, the data from center of \n\nk-space mainly determines contrast in the image while the outer lines primarily contain \n\nspatial information (Figure 11).

Basic Pulse Sequences \n \n\nA pulse sequence is a set of RF pulses applied to a sample to produce a specific form of \n\nNMR signal [22]. \n\n \n\nOne pulse sequence \n\n \n\nA single 90\u00ba RF pulse is applied uniformly to the sample in an associated static magnetic \n\nfield and the net magnetization is tipped into the transverse plane. After the pulse, as the \n\nspins begin to realign themselves and return to equilibrium orientation in z-direction, the \n\nnet magnetization begins to precess freely about  ??  , emitting energy. This energy is \n\ncaptured, resulting in an MR signal known as free induction decay (FID).

The FID \n\ndecays with time as relaxation occurs [15].  \n\n               \n \n\nFigure 12 \u2013 Free induction decay. A: oscillating FID recorded within stationary frame of \n\nreference. B: non-oscillating FID recorded within rotating frame of reference. [24] \n\n \n\nThe FID experiment is used in MR spectroscopy where different nuclei with different \n\nLarmor frequencies can be differentiated within a sample [18]. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 13 \u2013 T1 recovery curve by repeating 90\u00ba RF pulses [21]. \n\n \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\nAdditionally, repeated 90\u00ba pulses can be conducted to determine T1 time. The initial 90\u00ba \n\npulse, which takes the    to zero, is followed by a recovery time and then a second 90\u00ba \n\npulse is applied to examine the longitudinal recovery by displacing it into the transverse \n\nplane. By repeating the sequence with different repetition times (TR) a T1 recovery curve \u2013 \n\n  (   \n      ) \u2013 can be determined and T1 value can be estimated [18,21], as shown in \n\nFigure 13. \n\n \n\nSpin Echo (SE) sequence \n \n\nIn spin echo sequence, a 90\u00ba RF pulse is first applied to rotate the net magnetization into the  \n\ntransversal plane. After this pulse, dephasing occurs as the precessing of some spins are \n\nfaster than others due to  ??   inhomogeneities. Faster spins acquire positive phase (running \n\nclockwise), while slower ones lag behind and acquire negative phase (running \n\ncounterclockwise). Dephasing occurs during the first half echo time (TE), then a 180\u00ba RF \n\npulse is delivered to reverse or refocus the spins. As consequence the spins that were ahead \n\nbefore are now behind and vice versa, only the spins that are now behind will catch up as \n\ntheir respective speeds remain the same. Thus, after second half TE all spins will meet once \n\nagain in phase forming the echo signal [20,24], Figure 14. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\nFigure 14 \u2013 Spin echo sequence [17]. Figure 15 - Spin echo signal \n\nand exponential decay [17]. \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nThe maximal echo amplitude depends on T2 and not in T2\n*\n since spin echo only affects \n\ndephasing caused by field inhomogeneities and has no effect on spin-spin interaction \n\ndephasing, Figure 15. Therefore, an exponential decay curve   ( \n      ) can be \n\ndetermined by multiple experiments at different echo times, and T2 can be estimated [24]. \n\n \n\nGradient Recalled Echo (GRE) sequence \n\nIn gradient recalled echo sequences, or simply gradient echo, the echo is produced by \n\nmagnetic field gradients rather than pairs of RF pulses. This is done by first applying a \n\nfrequency-encoding gradient with negative polarity to induce dephasing of precessing spins \n\nand then the gradient is reversed and the spins rephase forming a gradient echo (Figure 16). \n\nSince gradient echoes do not need 180\u00ba refocusing pulse, very short repetition times (TR) \n\ncan be achieved. The repetition time is determinant in overall scan time of most sequences \n\nwhich makes GRE sequence much faster than spin echo sequence [20]. Another advantage \n\nof GRE by not using a 180\u00ba pulse is that less total RF power is applied to the patient and \n\nthus less total RF energy is deposited within the tissue [15]. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 16 \u2013 Gradient echo sequence [20].  \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\n2.2. MRI at Ultrahigh Fields  \n\n \nA continuous increasing of MRI field strength can be observed alongside its development. \n\nMore and more 3.0 T high field systems have been placed in clinical use beside 1.5 T \n\nconventional systems, and ultrahigh field (4 \u2013 9.4 T) systems have been installed at a \n\nnumber of research sites for human studies [27]. One of the reasons for the rise of field \n\nstrength is the increasing difference between spin up and spin down population with field \n\nstrength. This leads to a higher signal, and thus, a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be \n\nobtained [13]. A higher SNR can be traded for increasing spatial resolution or for \n\ndecreasing imaging time [11].  \n\nDespite increased SNR at ultrahigh field (UHF) systems, several drawbacks are present. An \n\nincreased    inhomogeneities due to magnetic susceptibility differences between air and \n\ntissue [28] causes varying precession frequencies of the spins, which diminishes a \n\nhomogeneous excitation and leads to a faster dephasing of the spins resulting in a shorter \n\nT2\n*\n [13]. However,    inhomogeneities can be reduced by    shimming.  \n\nThe Larmor frequency of the RF field (  \n ) applied, increases with the field strength, and \n\nhigher the frequency shorter becomes the RF wavelength (Table 2). At 7.0 T, with \n\nfrequencies near 300 MHz, the RF wavelength for protons in water is about 11cm, which \n\nleads regionally to negative interferences of superimposed RF waves. This creates \n\ninhomogeneities of the RF field in the body, which results in signal drop off in MR images, \n\nFigure 17 [13]. This constrain can be overcame by using surface array coils, by regulating \n\nthe amplitude and the phase of each array channel [29]. \n\n \n\nField \n\nstrength \n\nProton wavelength \n\nin air (cm) \n\nProton wavelength \n\nin water (cm) \n\n1.5 T 470 52 \n\n3.0 T 235 26 \n\n7.0 T 100 11 \n\n \n\nTable 2 \u2013 RF wavelength in air and in water for proton at different field strengths [13]. \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 17 \u2013 A: Effects of RF field inhomogeneities on MRI. B: MRI with corrected RF field \n\ninhomogeneities. [30] \n\n \n\nRF power deposition is another concern when referring to ultrahigh fields, as the RF field \n\ndoes not only affect the orientation of the net magnetization but also interacts with ions and \n\nmolecules in the tissue [13]. The absorbed energy results in temperature rise that is higher \n\nfor higher frequencies [13]. Thus, at UHF the risk of tissue heating and burning are \n\nincreased. To avoid excessive tissue heating, regulatory organizations, such as Food and \n\nDrug Administration (FDA) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), restricts \n\nthe maximum input power of RF field in order to not exceed the specific absorption rate \n\n(SAR) limit (Table 3) [15,31]. The evaluation of SAR values is an important procedure at \n\nUHF MRI to assure patient safety [31].  \n\n \n\nLimit \nWhole-Body \n\nAverage \n\nHeat \n\nAverage \n\nHead, Trunk \n\nLocal SAR \n\nExtremities \n\nLocal SAR \n\nIEC (6-minute average) \n    \n\nNormal (all patients) 2 W/kg (0.5\u00b0C) 3.2 W/kg 10 W/kg 20 W/kg \n\nFirst level (supervised) 4 W/kg (1\u00b0C) 3.2 W/kg 10 W/kg 20 W/kg \n\nSecond level (IRB approval) 4 W/kg (>1\u00b0C) >3.2 W/kg >10 W/kg >20 W/kg \n\nLocalized heating limit 39\u00b0C in 10 g 38\u00b0C in 10 g \n \n\n40\u00b0C in 10 g \n\nFDA \n4 W/kg for \n\n  15 min \n\n3 W/kg for \n\n10 min \n\n8 W/kg in 1g \n\nfor 10 min \n\n12 W/kg in 1g \n\nfor 5 min \n\nTable 3 \u2013International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC 60601-2-33:2010) and Food and US \n\nDrug Administration (FDA) guidelines on SAR and heating in human MRI studies. [32]  \n\nA B \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\n2.3. Fluorine (19F) imaging \n \n\nThe feasibility of \n19\n\nF MRI was first demonstrated by Holland et al. [10] four years after the \n\ndevelopment of \n1\nH MRI. \n\n19\nF has 100% natural abundance, a spin of 1/2, and a \n\ngyromagnetic ratio of 40.08 MHz/T (see Table 1) and 83% of the sensitivity of \n1\nH.  \n\nThe use of \n19\n\nF MRI also benefits from the similarity of gyromagnetic ratios of \n19\n\nF and \n1\nH \n\n(differs about 6%) which allows the use of the same equipment for both nuclei. The \n\nabsence of \n19\n\nF background in biological tissue (trace amounts of \n19\n\nF present in teeth and \n\nbones are negligible) [10] makes this nuclei a good probe to assess the structure, function \n\nand molecular display of various diseases [12]. \n\nThe \n19\n\nF MRI was usually performed at relatively low spatial (millimeters) and temporal \n\n(minutes to hours) resolution because of low concentration of \n19\n\nF atoms in region of \n\ninterest, though, these limitations can be overcame by the increased SNR at higher field \n\nstrength (e.g., 7T) and dedicated RF coils [12].  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\n3. RADIOFREQUENCY (RF) COILS  \n\n \nAs referred before, RF coils are used to excite the spins in order to produce a measurable \n\ntransversal signal (in transmission (Tx) mode) and to receive this signal (in receive (Rx) \n\nmode). An RF coil can be characterized as transmit only, receive only or both transmit and \n\nreceive (transceiver Tx/Rx) [33].  \n\nThere are two types of RF coils, volume coil and surface coil. Volume coils surround either \n\nthe whole body or a specific part of a body and are often carried out as birdcage coils. They \n\nconsist of wires arranged like rungs of a birdcage along the z-axis of the scanner. Due to \n\ntheir predetermined structure, it is not possible to position the coil to an arbitrarily position \n\non the patient and hence the typical applications of birdcage coils are the body coil, a head \n\ncoil or extremity coils These coils have the capability to generate a homogenous   \n  field \n\nover a large volume within the coil, however in higher magnetic fields the volume coils \n\nhave some   \n  homogeneity constraints. [21] \n\nSurface RF coils are RF coils placed directly on surface of the sample, which can be single \n\nor multiple turns of wire. This type of RF coil has an increased signal to noise ratio (SNR) \n\ndue to its very close placement on the patient, and as it generally comprises a smaller \n\nimaging volume, less noise is present, since the major source of noise is usually the tissue. \n\nOne drawback of this type of coils is its limited penetration depth, possible   \n  \n\ninhomogeneities and a reduced field-of-view (FOV) (the imaged area is more or less the \n\nsize of the coil) [11,18]. \n\nA way to overcome reduced FOV is the application of a coil array, which consists of \n\nnumerous single elements placed near each other. Therefore, the FOV can be increased and \n\nsimultaneously benefits from the good SNR of surface coils [14]. Coil arrays can also  be \n\nused to compensate for   \n  inhomogeneities by adapting the amplitude and phase of each \n\ntransmitter independently to reduce the negative interferences of the RF waves [34]. These \n\nadvantages made surface array coils preferred RF coils for UHF use, rather than volume \n\ncoils. \n\nThe next sections describe general aspects of a surface coil. \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\n3.1. RLC circuit  \n \n\nA simple loop surface coil can be described as a resonant RLC-circuit. This consists of \n\ninductance L, capacity C and resistance R representing the electrical losses, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 18. When connected to an alternating power source, the electrical energy is stored \n\nperiodically within the magnetic field of the inductance or the electrical field of the \n\ncapacitance. The resonant frequency of the RLC circuit is [14] \n\n \n  \n\n \n\n  ?  \n Eq. 5 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 18 \u2013 An RLC resonant circuit in series [35]. \n\n \n\nWhen building RF surface coils for MRI, the inductance is determined by the geometry of \n\nthe copper conductors. Therefore, the resonance frequency can only be changed by \n\nadjusting the value of the capacitors within the circuit. Inserting multiple capacitors has \n\nanother purpose. As the wavelength at ultrahigh fields approaches the length of the \n\nconductors, there would be sites with no signal due to the zero phase of the sinusoidal \n\nwave. By inserting capacitors, they partition the RF coil, keeping the conductors short \n\ncompared to the wavelength avoiding the zero phases. But each inserted capacitor increases \n\nthe total loss within the RF coil and thus worsens the RF coils performance. By choosing a \n\nsuitable number of capacitors, both effects can be balanced [36]. \n\n3.2. Tuning and Matching \n\nThe resonant circuit described previously needs to be tuned to the Larmor frequency of the \n\nprotons in order to successfully excite them. Therefore, a tuning capacitor Ct is inserted in \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\nthe circuit. On the other hand the resonant circuit also needs to be matched to the \n\nimpedance of the MR scanner and the coaxial cables, which is typically 50 ?, in order to \n\nachieve optimal signal transfer from the power source to the RF coil avoiding reflections \n\nthat occur when the impedances differ. The matching can be handled by adding a matching \n\ncapacitor Cm to the circuit. The Figure 19 shows an RLC circuit with additional tuning and \n\nmatching capacitors [14]. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 19 \u2013 Equivalent serial RLC circuit of an MRI coil with tuning-matching circuit [35]. \n\n \n\n3.3. Decoupling \n\nWhen two loops are tuned to the same resonant frequency and placed near each other, their \n\nmutual inductance causes the resonances to split as shown in Figure 20. This results in a \n\nloss of sensitivity of the two coils. Therefore the neighboring elements have to be \n\ndecoupled [34]. \n\n \n\nFigure 20 \u2013 Element coupling and frequency shift [34]. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\n \n\nOne of the decoupling methods is the overlap decoupling. It can be performed by moving \n\ntwo neighboring elements one upon the other so that they partially overlap. The magnetic \n\nflux, caused by one of the elements, is penetrating its neighboring element as well as the \n\noverlapping area, but in both cases with a different direction. Hence, their mutual \n\ninductance can be canceled out and the magnetic flux in the second element can be zeroed \n\nby adjusting the size of the overlap area. The drawbacks of this method are the geometrical \n\nconstraints that go along with it. By partially overlapping two elements, the next-\n\nneighboring elements are automatically closer to each other and can therefore potentially \n\ncouple stronger [37]. \n\nThe Other way of how to decouple elements is the inductive or capacitive decoupling [38]. \n\nTwo elements can be arranged so that they share a common conductor, illustrated in Figure \n\n21, and an inductive or capacitive element can be brought into it. By adjusting the value of \n\nthese elements, the mutual inductance of the elements can be cancelled out. As the losses of \n\ncapacitive elements are usually lower, primarily capacitors are used for this purpose. One \n\ngreat advantage of this method is the possibility to decouple even non-adjacent element by \n\nconnecting them with coaxial cables with two capacitors in between [37]. \n\n \nFigure 21 \u2013 Addition of a capacitor CD between two elements that share a common conductor to \n\navoid mutual inductance [35]. \n\n \n\n3.4. Cable Trap \n\nCoaxial cables (Figure 22) are used to feed each element of the coil. On this type of cable, \n\nthe current on the inner conductor and on the shield are equal and opposite so there is no \n\nenergy to be radiated. However unbalanced current can be induced on the shield due to \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\nunsymmetrical feeding of RF coil or from a near electromagnetic field, such as RF field. \n\nUnder this situation, it can lead to increased power requirements, stronger coupling \n\nbetween the elements and cable heating in transmit mode, and also to significant decreased \n\nSNR in receive mode. A cable trap is a specialized circuit to suppress induced unbalanced \n\ncurrent on the shield [34]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 22 \u2013 Coaxial cable \u2013 cut away view [39]. \n\n \n\n3.5. Scattering-Parameters (S-Parameters) \n\nThe S-parameters describe the power transmission and reflection in a given system without \n\nknowledge about its components, and are therefore, used to quantify tuning, matching and \n\ndecoupling. S-parameters are usually expressed in dB and organized in an S-parameter \n\nmatrix. A network with N ports will have an N x N dimension S-matrix [40]. \n\n  \n\nFigure 23 \u2013 A two-port component indicating the transmitted and reflected waves ai and bi [35]. \n\n \n\nAssuming a network with 2 ports, signals can be fed in (described by the parameter ai) and \n\nread out (described by the parameter bi) at 2 locations, as shown in Figure 23. The S-matrix \n\nwill have the size of 2 x 2 and its entries are \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\n    \n  \n  \n|\n    \n\n \nEq. 6.1 \n\n \n\n    \n  \n  \n|\n    \n\n \nEq. 6.3 \n\n    \n  \n  \n|\n    \n\n \nEq. 6.2 \n\n    \n  \n  \n|\n    \n\n \nEq. 6.4 \n\n \n\nSii is called the reflection coefficient, giving information about the fraction of the signal \n\nwhich is reflected at the port i and did not propagate through the component. On the other \n\nhand, the parameters Sij, with i ? j, represent the transmission coefficient, providing how \n\nmuch of the signal, inserted at port j, is transferred and lost into port i [40]. An example of a \n\ncoil with two elements is shown on Figure 24.  \n\n \n\nFigure 24 \u2013 S-parameters of a coil with 2 elements at 297 MHz. The reflection coefficient S11 and \n\nS22 are approximately -50 dB, which means only 0.00001 of the power transmitted is reflected \n\nback. The transmission coefficient S12 is -30 dB shows that 0.001 of the power inserted at element 1 \n\nis transmitted into element 2.  \n\n \n\n \n\n?S11 \n\n?S22 \n\n?S12 \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\n3.6. Quality factor \n \n\nQuality factor or Q measures the performance of the coil (a tuned circuit) and is the ratio of \n\nstored energy to dissipated energy in the system. Equivalently, it can be seen as the ratio of \n\nthe reactive impedance to the resistive impedance \n\n  \n  \n\n \n      Eq. 7 \n\nQuality factor is also a measure of the current or voltage magnification achieved by the \n\ncoil. A higher Q means a narrower frequency response and the coil behaves like a band-\n\npass filter, eliminating noise from outside the bandwidth of interest, and an improved SNR \n\ncan be obtained  [11].  \n\nThe SNR is proportional to the square root of the loaded Q (QL \u2013 loaded to a sample such as \n\na patient or a phantom) and an optimum SNR results when the sample noise is dominant, \n\nthat is when the ratio of QL and unloaded Q (QuL \u2013 without any sample loaded) is less than \n\n0.5 [19]. \n\nA practical way to calculate Q is using linear S11 curve of the coil tuned at f0 and the \n\nbandwidth of Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) shown by Eq. 8 [41] \n\n   \n  \n\n    \n  Eq. 8 \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\n4. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n4.1 Coil Construction  \n\nIn order to detect at 7.0 T both proton (f = 297 MHz) and fluorine (f = 279.5 MHz) signals a \n\ndual tunable transceiver array coil with eight elements was constructed. The coil was made \n\nof three parts, two identical anterior parts and one posterior part to fit the anatomy of an \n\naverage knee, Figure 25.  \n\n \n\nFigure 25 \u2013 \n1\nH/\n\n19\nF dual tuned knee coil made of three parts: two identical anterior parts and one \n\nposterior part to fit the anatomy of an average knee. \n\n \n\nEach of the anterior sections consists of three elements, each one with a size of 5 \u00d7 5 cm, \n\nwere arranged in a triangular form in order to facilitate the decoupling of neighboring \n\nelements and bent to better cover the region of interest. As the short wavelength of RF field \n\nat 7.0 T leads to significant phase variations along the conductor, high Q ceramic capacitors \n\nwere equally placed around the loop to shorten the conductor length. Decoupling between \n\nadjacent elements was allowed by a common conductor with a sharing decoupling capacitor \n\nwith high Q. For tuning and matching trim capacitors (1-13 pF) with high Q were used. On \n\nright side of the Figure 26 trim and non-trim capacitor placements can be found. \n\nTwo of those elements placed above the knee were tuned to fluorine frequency and the \n\nlateral one to proton frequency, Figure 26 left.  \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 26 \u2013 Left: anterior part of the coil consisted by two identical 3 loop elements sections. Two \n\nof these loops, placed above the knee, were tuned to \n19\n\nF and the lateral one to proton frequency. \n\nRight: detail of one of the anterior section\u2019s circuit, where capacitors to shorten the conductor \n\nlength and tuning, matching and decoupling capacitors are shown. \n\n \n\nThe posterior part of the coil consists of two elements with a size of 180 \u00d7 95 mm tuned to \n\nproton frequency. It was bended to fit the knee fold, serving as a comfortable support while \n\nmeasurements occur. Tuning, matching, decoupling capacitors and capacitors shortening \n\nthe conductor length can be seen on Figure 27.  \n\n   \n\nFigure 27 \u2013 Left: posterior part of the coil consisted by 2 loop elements tuned to proton \n\nfrequency. Right: detail the posterior section\u2019s circuit, where capacitors to shorten the \n\nconductor length and tuning, matching and decoupling capacitors are shown. \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\nThe coils were manufactured from printed circuit board (PCB) using a computer numerical \n\ncontrol (CNC) machine Promat S100 (LpKF, Garbsen, Germany). The width of the \n\nconductor was 10 mm to minimize ohmic losses. \n\n \n\n4.1.1. Casing \n\nA solid casing was designed to meet safety and comfort (Autodesk Inventor 2010, San \n\nRafael, CA). It was built with the rapid prototyping system BST 1200es (Dimension, Eden \n\nPrairie, MN) using ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene). The casing prevents a direct \n\ncontact between the tissue and the coil, and thus avoiding tissue heating caused by high \n\nelectric fields in the conductors and capacitors.  \n\n \n\n4.1.2. Cable trap \n\nCable traps were placed in the feeding coaxial cable of each element to suppress induced \n\nunbalanced current on the outer conductor at 279.5 MHz and 297.0 MHz for fluorine and \n\nproton cables, respectively. The cable trap was made out of two turns of the feeding cable \n\nwith an adequate capacitor soldered to the outer conductor to adjust the frequency, Figure \n\n28. The capacitor value was found using a pick-up loop. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 28 \u2013 Cable trap used in the coil. It consists of two turns of the feeding cable with a capacitor \n\nsoldered to the shield. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\n4.2. Electromagnetic field (EMF) simulations \n \n\nAt    higher than approximately 3.0 T, quasistatic solutions may no longer be employed, \n\nand the propagation of the magnetic field through the object has to be considered. The \n\nstrength and phase of the RF field vary as function of position within the object, and \n\ndetermined by its form, permittivity, and conductivity. Even for simple geometrical \n\nconfigurations analytical solutions are difficult to obtain [42]. Hence, full wave simulation \n\nof the electromagnetic field is necessary to obtain complex behavior of RF field and RF \n\npower deposition in the tissues. \n\nEMF simulations were carried out by the software SEMCAD X (Schmid &amp; Partner \n\nEngineering AG, Zurich, Switzerland) based on finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) \n\nmethod that uses the differential form of Maxwell\u2019s equations for the discretization and \n\ncomputation of EM fields in a gridded 3D volume [43]. \n\nIn order to find right capacitor values for capacitive shortening of the conductor and tuning, \n\nmatching and decoupling of the elements, capacitors of the coil were modeled and \n\nsimulated as 50 ? ports. The resulting S-Parameters (saved as a touchstone file) were \n\nexported into an S-parameter simulator, Advanced Design System (ADS) (Agilent \n\nTechnologies, Santa Clara, California, USA), where the optimal values were found. With \n\nthese capacitors values, another EM simulation in SEMCAD X was carried out to obtain \n\nthe correct electromagnetic field responses of the coil. Figure 29 shows SEMCAD X \n\nenvironment and Figure 30 and Figure 31 show ADS environment. \n\n   \n\nFigure 29 \u2013 Left: all capacitors were modeled and simulated as 50 ? ports (in red) in order to be \n\nexported to ADS to be find optimal capacitive values. Right: the ports were replaced by capacitors \n\n(in blue) when their values were found on ADS. \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 30 \u2013 ADS circuit design environment. The touchstone file of ports EMF simulations are \n\nimported, the ports representing capacitors are replaced by capacitors and S-parameter simulation is \n\nsimulated in order to find optimal capacitor values. \n\n \n\nFigure 31 \u2013 ADS S-parameter visualization environment. The option \u201cTune\u201d permits to change \n\ncapacitor values at real time and by visualizing the S-parameters, optimal capacitor values are found. \n\nThis environment is similar to real-life vector network analyzer (VNA) to tune, match and decouple the \n\ncoil elements. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n4.2.1. Phantom simulation \n\n \n\nEMF simulation of the coil was performed with the coil loaded to a phantom to access   \n  \n\nfield patterns that would be compared to the measurements in order to validate the \n\nsimulations (Figure 32 left). The phantom was modeled after a cylindrical phantom \n\navailable at B.U.F.F. with similar tissue properties as an average knee (?r = 65, ? = 0.72 \n\nS/m). \n\nTo balance accuracy and simulation time, the resolution of the mesh was set as 3 mm in all \n\n3 dimensions over the phantom. Grid refinement was necessary to properly discretize the \n\nconductors and lumped elements (Figure 32 right) in order to produce realistic paths for the \n\ncurrents. The resulting grid had 3.06 million cells (135 \u00d7 154 \u00d7 147). \n\n   \n\nFigure 32 \u2013 Left: EM Simulation model of the phantom with the coil placed in a manner similar as \n\nin real-life measurements on the scanner. Right: Voxelized model. \n\n \n\n4.2.2. Human model simulation \n \n\nHuman model simulations were performed with the posable human body model \u201cDuke\u201d \n\n(virtual family, IT\u2019IS Foundation, Zurich, Switzerland). \u201cDuke\u201d model (male, age 34 years \n\nold, height 1.77 m, weight 72.4 kg) was developed from high resolution MRI scans of a \n\nhealthy volunteer, and reconstructed as a 3D CAD object with approximately 80 high \n\nresolution organs and tissues [44].  \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\nTo save simulation and post-processing time, only the lower part of the model was used, \n\nFigure 33. This was possible due to the local performance of surface coils.  \n\nThe resolution of the mesh was set as 3 mm in all 3 dimensions over the region of interest. \n\nGrid refinement was conducted to proper discretization of the conductors and lumped \n\nelements. The resulting grid had 10.48 million cells (232 \u00d7 139 \u00d7 325). \n\n \n\nFigure 33 \u2013 Voxelized lower member of \u201cDuke\u201d with the coil. \n\n \n\nSAR evaluation \n\nPart of the energy carried by a time-harmonic EMF is deposited in lossy objects by induced \n\nconduction currents, which may result into local heating [43]. \n\nAs mentioned before, SAR measures the energy absorbed by the biological tissues. The \n\nlocal SAR can be calculated with Eq. 9 when a specific location is given \n\n   (  )  \n \n\n  \n     Eq. 9 \n\n \n\n  is the electrical conductivity,    equals  ?   ?  , the squared magnitude of the induced \n\nelectric field, and   is the mass density. Local SAR is not always useful, as it is too \n\nsensitive to approximation in the computational methods. Therefore, averaged SAR in a \n\nregion R with mass M is mostly used for safety concerns [43]. \n\nAccording to IEEE/IEC62704-1, R is recommended to be a cube aligned to the \n\ncomputational grid and sized to contain a specific M of lossy tissue (normally 1 g or 10 g). \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\nThe cube can also contain background material (air or other non-conductive tissues), \n\nhowever, it should not exceed more than 10% of the volume occupied by the cube. The \n\ncube is expanded at each location to compute the average SAR, resulting in a distribution of \n\naveraged SAR values along the entire region of interest.  \n\nThe SAR evaluation was performed by post processing tool of SEMCAD X, MRI toolkit. \n\nThis tool is able to combine magnetic and electric field of all or selected coil elements, and \n\ndisplays the result at selected frequencies.  \n\nThe averaged SAR for the coil was calculated at 279.5 MHz and 297.0 MHz, by computing \n\nIEEE/IEC62704-1 constant mass cube of 10 g without any phase setting and with phase \n\nsetting 3 (Table 15), which showed good   \n  homogeneity in the region of interest in vivo. \n\nThe overall delivered power, which is the power delivered to all channel without losses, \n\nwas set as 1 W, and equally distributed to each channel. The worst case SAR was also \n\ncomputed. The worst SAR is calculated by MRI toolkit of SEMCAD X by analyzing all \n\npossible phases and amplitudes for all active transmission ports, and then displays the \n\nsetting that produces more SAR in the sample [43]. \n\n \n\n4.3. RF Bench analysis \n\nFor a circuit analysis of the coil an 8-channel vector network analyzer (VNA) ZVT8 \n\n(Rhode &amp; Schwarz GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Munich, Germany), with a frequency range of 3 kHz \n\nto 8 GHz, was used to assess the S-parameters.  \n\n \n\nFigure 34 \u2013 ZVT8 (Rhode &amp; Schwarz GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Munich, Germany). \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\n4.3.1. Tuning, Matching and Decoupling \n \n\nBy connecting the coil directly to the VNA, the tuning, matching and decoupling of \n\nelements were possible by real-time assessment of the S-parameters. \n\n \n\n4.3.2. Q factor measurement \n \n\nThe unloaded Q of each element of the coil was obtained using Eq. 8, with S-parameters \n\nacquired by VNA in unloaded conditions.  \n\nThe loaded Q of each element was obtained with the coil loaded to a subject with 25 years \n\nold and 55 kg. It was also calculated with Eq. 8 using S-parameters obtained by the VNA. \n\n \n\n4.4. Measurements \n \n\nAll images and spectroscopies were acquired on a 7.0 T whole-body scanner (Siemens \n\nHealthcare, Erlangen, Germany), Figure 35, equipped with an Avanto gradient system \n\ncapable to achieve a slew rate of up to 200 mT/m/ms, maximum gradient strength of 40 \n\nmT/m (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) and an 8 kW RF amplifier \n\n(Stolberg HF-Technik, Stolberg-Vicht, Germany).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 35 \u2013 7.0 T whole-body scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\n4.4.1. Coil interface \n \n\nThe connection between the coil and the scanner is carried out by the coil interface. It \n\nconsists of a Tx/Rx switch box (Figure 36) with integrated low impedance preamplifiers, \n\ntwo 1 to 4 power splitter boxes (one for proton channels (Figure 37) and one for fluorine \n\nchannels), and the coil plug with a coil file associated that bears the coil parameters, such as \n\nwhich nuclei is been scanned and RF power limitations. The power splitters were necessary \n\nsince the power plug for the coil provided by the Siemens scanner consisted only in a single \n\ntransmit plug.  \n\n \n   Figure 36 \u2013 Tx/Rx switch box. \n\n \n\nFigure 37 \u2013 1 to 4 power splitter. \n\n \n\nThe coil interface described above, was used for the measurements of T1, T2, concentration \n\ncurve and   \n  mapping measurements. Later, a specialized coil interface box (Figure 38) \n\nwas constructed for \n1\nH/\n\n19\nF dual tuned knee coil with integrated power splitters. This new \n\ncoil interface was used for in vivo imaging and spectroscopy. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 38 \u2013 Coil interface box specialized for \n\n1\nH/\n\n19\nF dual tuned knee coil with integrated power \n\nsplitters. \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\n4.4.2.   \n  mapping \n\n \n\nTo validate the EMF simulations a comparison between simulated individual element and \n\nMR measured individual element   \n  maps were performed with a cylindrical phantom (?r = \n\n65, ? = 0.72 S/m) free of fluorine components. \n\nThe transmission field of each element was acquired with Bloch-Siegert implementation \n\n[45].  Each evaluated element was directly connected to the single power transmit plug of \n\nthe scanner, while the remaining elements were connect to 50 ? power loads in order to \n\nabsorb any power received through mutual coupling.  \n\n  \n  maps were done offline using Bloch simulations in Matlab (MathWorks Inc., Natick, \n\nMassachusetts, USA). The resulting maps were giving in arbitrary units (a. u.), hence, in \n\norder to allow the comparison between measured and simulated   \n  maps, a unit conversion \n\nto    ?   was performed using Eq. 10. \n\n \n\n   \n [   ?  ]    \n\n [    ]\n          \n\n      \n?    ?    Eq. 10 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe           is the achieved approximate flip angle and        is the required voltage, \n\nboth given by Siemens scanner raw data. As the simulation does not have losses, the \n\nmeasurements were corrected to the hardware losses, Q-factors and S-parameters. The \n\ncorrection with S-parameters was necessary as the phantom did not contain fluorine, which \n\nmade the maps for the fluorine channels be acquired at \n1\nH frequency, therefore, the losses \n\noriginated by not matched and tuned fluorine channels to \n1\nH frequency could be corrected. \n\n \n\n4.4.3. Determination of T1 and T2 \n \n19\n\nF spectroscopy was performed in order to determine T1 and T2 of fluorine containing \n\nNSAID ointment (flufenamic acid (2-{[3-(Trifluoromethyl) phenyl]amino}benzoic acid) \n\nused in this project. The measured samples were two cylindrical MR probes (inner diameter \n\n= 4.52 mm, height = 50 mm) filled with NSAID ointment, and 50% NSAID ointment plus \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\n50% fluorine free ointment. In order to cover only one MR probe for each measurement, \n\nSPin ECho full Intensity Acquired Localized (SPECIAL) [46]  technique was used (Figure \n\n39). This technique allows data acquisition only in the ROI enclosed by a predefined voxel. \n\nFor a more accurate position of the voxel, \n19\n\nF gradient-echo (GRE) images were acquired \n\nfor orientation (TR = 90 ms, TE = 1.3 ms, in plane resolution: 2 \u00d7 2 mm\n2\n, slice thickness: 5 \n\nmm, matrix: 128 \u00d7 128).  \n\n \n\nFigure 39 \u2013 \n19\n\nF GRE image (TR = 90 ms, TE = 1.3 ms, in plane resolution: 2 \u00d7 2 mm\n2\n, slice \n\nthickness: 5 mm, matrix: 128 \u00d7 128) of a sample filled with NSAID ointment. Left: sagittal view of \n\nSPECIAL voxel. Right: transversal view of SPECIAL voxel. \n\n \n\nA voxel of size 7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 40 mm was placed around the MR probe. \n19\n\nF spectroscopy for T1 \n\nmeasurements was performed with 128 averages, TE of 5.5 ms and different TR durations. \n\n19\nF spectroscopy for T2 measurements were performed with 128 averages, TR of 4000 ms \n\nand different TE durations. The obtained data were processed in Matlab (MathWorks Inc., \n\nNatick, Massachusetts, USA) and fitted to T1 and T2 equations, described in section 2.1.5, \n\nin order to determine T1 and T2 relaxation times.  \n\n \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\n4.4.4. Calibration curve \n \n\nFor the calibration curve, which is the relationship between the amount of fluorine \n\ncontained in the sample and the respect signal magnitude, spectroscopies were performed \n\nwith TR of 2000 ms. TE of 5.5 ms, and different voxel sizes to limit different amount of the \n\nsamples. The number of averages varies according to the voxel size to assure the same SNR \n\nfor all measurements.  \n\n \n\n4.4.5. In vivo Imaging \n \n\nHigh resolution GRE proton images (TR = 12 ms, TE = 3.4 ms, in plane resolution: 0.7 \u00d7 \n\n0.7 mm\n2\n, slice thickness: 5 mm, matrix: 384 \u00d7 384) and fluorine images (TR = 90 ms, TE = \n\n1.3 ms, in plane resolution: 2 \u00d7 2 mm\n2\n, slice thickness: 5 mm, matrix: 128 \u00d7 128) were \n\nacquired.  \n\nIn vivo   \n  shimming was performed using different phase settings to obtain a more \n\nhomogeneous   \n  distribution over the region of interest.  \n\n \n\n4.4.6. In vivo 19F Spectroscopy  \n \n\nAs there were no volunteers with active inflammation on the knee available at moment of \n\nthis study, two healthy subjects were asked to apply topically the flufenamic acid \n\ncontaining NSAID ointment on the skin surrounding the knee, in order to detect eventual \n\nointment absorption. For this purpose unlocalized \n19\n\nF spectroscopy using FID was regularly \n\nperformed, and any change of initial signal magnitude can be used to trace substance \n\nabsorption.  \n\nSubject 1 applied topically 5.82 g of the NSAID ointment, corresponding to 0.621 mmol of \n\nflufenamic acid, and was monitored approximately 70 minutes without leaving the scanner.  \n\nSubject 2 was asked to apply 9.65 g of the NSAID ointment, containing 1.03 mmol of \n\nflufenamic acid, and was monitored 172 minutes in two scan sessions, with each one not \n\nexceeding 50 minutes. At end of the session, after 172 minutes of the first spectroscopy, a \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\nSPECIAL voxel spectroscopy was performed. The voxel was placed inside the knee under \n\nNSAID ointment application as shown in Figure 40. \n\n \n\nFigure 40 \u2013 SPECIAL voxel placement inside the knee under NSAID ointment application.

DISCUSSION \n\n \n\nIn this project, a knee coil tuned to proton and to fluorine frequencies was constructed in \n\norder to access the dynamics of a fluorine contained NSAID ointment, from its application \n\nin the skin to the site of inflammation in knees suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. In this \n\nsection, results obtained in the previous section are discussed. \n\n6.1. Coil performance \n \n\nThe coil consisted of two bent anterior parts that easily cover the anterior part of an average \n\nknee and one lower part that was designed to support an average knee in a bent position; \n\nthis offers better comfort than a plane design for MRI examining subjects. The three parts \n\nof the coils are made by eight loop elements to cover all the region of interest, since surface \n\ncoils have reduced field of view of approximately its diameter. \n\nCable traps built to suppress the induced unbalanced currents in the feeding coaxial cables \n\nof each channel show a performance ranged from -13 dB to -20 dB. In the worst case, 5% \n\nof the unbalanced shield current is not attenuated, hence the cable traps can be considered \n\nto have a reasonable performance. \n\nThe reflection coefficients (Sii) of each coil element were situated below -30 dB, which \n\nmeans that only 0.1% of the power is reflected back. This result show that tuning and \n\nmatching of the coil was well performed and little loss occurs. This is important for coil \n\nperformance since loss in reflection will result in less available power to generate the   \n  \n\nfield to excite the spins. On the other hand, the transmission coefficients (Sij) of the \n\nelements of the same coil parts showed a variation from -16 dB to -25 dB meaning that in \n\nthe worst case 2.5% of the power delivered to an element is lost into another. This is an \n\nacceptable result since it does not translate into a significant loss. By changing the \n\ncapacitance of the tuning, matching and decoupling of the trim capacitors, the coil could be \n\neasily adapted to various subjects and to the phantom without further capacitance changes \n\nin the conductor shortening capacitors. \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n\nThe ratio between loaded and unloaded Q, of all coil elements, lies below 0.5. This is a \n\ndesired result since QL/QuL below 0.5 indicates the dominance of sample noise, and under \n\nthis situation an optimum SNR could be achieved. \n\n6.2.   \n  mapping comparison \n\n \n\nThe simulated and measured   \n  maps patterns showed a significant agreement. It is \n\nimportant to refer that the phantom used in the measurements was constructed by \n\ncolleagues at B.U.F.F. and was aimed to measure temperature changes in RF heating \n\nexperiments, thus it has three holes along its extension for the insertion of thermometers. \n\nThis fact caused artifacts in   \n  patterns of elements 1 and 2, since the holes are considered \n\nsingularities in the Bloch algorithm when unwrapping phase.  \n\nThe comparison of maximum values of the measured and the simulated   \n  (Table 8), \n\nrevealed that the measurements are 15% to 53% less than the simulations, with a higher \n\nloss at fluorine channels. An unexpected gain of 20% in   \n  value was found in channel 1 \n\nwhich led to a further analysis of   \n  map of this channel. It was found that the maximum \n\nmeasured   \n  value of channel 1 was located in a region far away from the coil, where a \n\nhole for a thermometer is located, Figure 57. The actual maximum   \n  value produced by \n\nthe coil is approximately 27    ?  , which compared to simulated   \n , is 17% less. \n\nWith the corrected value for channel 1, the measured maps for proton channels showed an \n\nextra loss of 21.5 \u00b1 7.6% compared to simulated maps, despite the loss correction made in \n\nTable 7. On this table Sii values for channels 1 and 2 were not registered, but since these \n\nchannels were tuned and matched to the proton frequency, Sii should not be higher than -15 \n\ndB, thus the   \n  value correction with S-parameters should not produce significant \n\ndifference. The extra losses could be explained by further unknown losses in the MR \n\nsystem.  \n\nThe phantom used in the   \n  mapping measurements did not contain fluorine compounds, \n\nthus, the   \n  maps of fluorine elements were acquired in proton frequency and then \n\nextrapolated to fluorine frequency by correcting with S-parameters. Also, the S-parameters \n\nwere acquired in the laboratory and not inside the scanner; therefore they are just an \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\napproximation of the actual S-parameters values of the mapping measurement. This fact, \n\nplus further losses that occur in the MR system could explain the relatively high difference, \n\n47.8 \u00b1 9.2%, between measured and simulated \n19\n\nF channels.  \n\nIn this experiment, the validity of the simulation could be accepted by reasonable \n\nqualitative and quantitative agreement between measured and simulated   \n  maps of the \n\nproton channels. On the other hand, despite the qualitative agreement, relatively higher \n\nquantitative difference was found in fluorine channels, due to the fact that there was no \n\nfluorine containing phantom available to make a proper \n19\n\nF   \n  mapping, this fact should \n\nnot deter the validation of the simulations, which gives credibility of SAR simulations.  \n\nA more accurate   \n  mapping for the dual tuned knee coil could be made, by using a \n\nuniform proton containing phantom for \n1\nH channels and a uniform fluorine containing \n\nphantom for \n19\n\nF measurements. Also, the simulations should reproduce the exact \n\npositioning, size and dielectric properties of the phantom in MR experiments to achieve a \n\nbetter comparison. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 57 \u2013 Left:   \n  map of channel 1 scaled from 0 to 39    ?  . Right:   \n\n  map of channel 1 \n\nscaled from 27 to 39    ?  , it shows that the maximum   \n  value is not located in the expected \n\nregion next to the channel 1, instead it is located in a far region from the channel 1 where a hole \n\nfor insertion of a thermometer is placed. At approximately 27    ?   there is no signal left in \n\nthe region next to channel 1, thus this value can be said to be the actual maximum   \n  value \n\nproduced by channel 1. \n\nChannel 1 scaled from 0 to 39 ?? ???

SAR evaluation \n \n\nFor input power of 1 W to all the channels, 10 g averaged SAR for phase setting 3 was \n\nfound to be 0.306 W/kg at 279.5 MHz (fluorine frequency) and 0.375 W/kg at 297.0 MHz \n\n(proton frequency). As the limit defined by IEC for 10g SAR at body extremity is 20 W/kg, \n\na power increase until as high as 53 W for the coil at this phase setting (resulting in SAR \n\nvalue of 19.9 W/kg) will still stay within the limit of IEC guidelines.  \n\nSince different phase and amplitude settings of the power at each port affects the SAR, the \n\nworst case SAR given by MRI toolkit of SEMCAD X could be used, for safety issues, as \n\nreference for delimitation of the RF power in the coil plug.  \n\nIt is also important to refer that the SAR calculations are made without power loss that \n\noccurs in real MR scans, thus, in real-life, the SAR values would not exceed the expected \n\nvalue from the simulations. \n\n6.4. T1, T2 and concentration curve \n \n\nDifferent T1 and T2 values were found for 100% flufenamic acid containing NSAID \n\nointment sample and 50% flufenamic acid containing NSAID ointment + 50% non-fluorine \n\ncontaining ointment sample. This is an expected result, since the molecular environment \n\nwas modified with the introduction of non-fluorine containing ointment. This also explains \n\ndifferent concentration curve slops of these two samples. \n\n6.5. In vivo imaging and 19F spectroscopy \n \n\nIn vivo high spatial resolution proton images (TR = 12 ms, TE = 3.4 ms, in plane \n\nresolution: 0.7 \u00d7 0.7 mm\n2\n, slice thickness: 5 mm, matrix: 384 \u00d7 384) with phase setting 3 \n\nshowed homogenous image quality and contrast. The Overlapping of \n19\n\nF image (TR = 90 \n\nms, TE = 1.3 ms, in plane resolution: 2 \u00d7 2 mm\n2\n, slice thickness: 5 mm, matrix: 128 \u00d7 128) \n\nand \n1\nH image allows visualization and localization of fluorine contained NSAID ointment. \n\nThis is of a major importance for in vivo drug tracking, which permits the sight of \n19\n\nF \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\ncontained NSAID localization within the body, if drug penetration occurs and if the \n\npenetrated quantity allows the detection. \n\nIn vivo \n19\n\nF spectroscopy performed with two healthy subjects with topically applied \n\nflufenamic acid contained NSAID in the skin near the knee didn\u2019t show signal decrease \n\ncompared to the initial signal (Table 16 and Figure 56), which was originally expected to \n\noccur if any quantity of NSAID would be skin absorbed. In fact, non-localized \n\nspectroscopy excites all the \n19\n\nF nuclei within the FOV, which included regions outside and \n\ninside the body, in this way the spectroscopy made is inconclusive.  \n\nOn the other hand the spectroscopy performed to subject 2 with SPECIAL voxel placed \n\ninside the knee beneath skin area where topical NSAID was applied did not show presence \n\nof fluorine after 172 minutes of beginning of the scanning session. This result shows that \n\neither it did not occurred any skin absorption of the topically applied NSAID at depth of the \n\nplaced SPECIAL voxel within the scanning time, or the absorption occurred, but the \n\nabsorbed quantity could be too low to be detected. \n\nFurther in vivo studies could be performed using voxel spectroscopies, one placed outside \n\nthe knee on top of the area where NSAID is applied and other placed inside the knee \n\nbeneath application area. This should be performed with patients with rheumatoid arthritis \n\nin the knee and also with health volunteers. In this way, the absence of fluorine signal in the \n\nin vivo experiment performed for this work could also be checked if was due to the \n\ninexistence of the inflammation site for NSAID penetration. The absorption of NSAID \n\ncould also be monitored for longer periods, such as days, instead of just a few hours, as it \n\nwas used in this study. Therefore, an accumulative absorption of the NSAID could be \n\nevaluated.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\n7. CONCLUSION \n\n \n\nThe eight channel dual tuned knee array coil constructed for the present thesis for the use at \n\n7.0 T ultrahigh magnetic field showed good performance evidenced by its low reflection \n\nand transmission coefficients (<-30 dB and&lt;-16 dB respectively) and noise dominant Q \n\nratio,  which enounces SNR gain. \n\nThe performed EM simulations with a phantom showed reasonable qualitative and \n\nquantitative agreement with the experiment results for proton channels validating the \n\nreliability of the SAR calculations for a human model, which give an estimation of the \n\ndeposited RF power in the tissue. \n\nHigh spatial resolution images were acquired with this coil for proton (0.7 \u00d7 0.7 mm\n2\n in \n\nplane resolution and 5 mm slice thickness) and for fluorine (2 \u00d7 2 mm\n2\n in plane resolution \n\nand 5 mm slice thickness \u00d7 5 mm). After an in vivo   \n  shimming session, images presented \n\nan increased quality since the RF destructive interference was attenuated. These parameters \n\nare important for knee imaging due to small structures around this joint.  \n\nIn vivo unlocalized \n19\n\nF spectroscopy that aimed to observe and to quantify the skin \n\nabsorption of flufenamic acid contained NSAID showed inconclusive results. And the \n\nspectroscopy performed with a SPECIAL voxel placed inside the knee did not show any \n\nfluorine signal, either due to non-absorption of the NSAID or the absorbed quantity was too \n\nlow to be detected. \n\nFurther improved in vivo experiments could be carried out using the dual tuned \n1\nH/\n\n19\nF knee \n\ncoil in the study of the effectiveness of penetration and action of NSAIDs within patients \n\nwith rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the knee. These experiments could be performed using \n\ntwo voxel, one inside and one outside the knee, for \n19\n\nF spectroscopy, in healthy and RA \n\npatients for longer monitoring times.  \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n\n8.
