As suas \naplica\u00e7\u00f5es incluem a electr\u00f3nica, consum\u00edveis (p.e. cosm\u00e9ticos), medicina, \nremedia\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental e catalisadores. Apesar  do aumento na utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de \nnanomaterias e consequente despejo no ambiente, os seus efeitos e \ncomportamento s\u00e3o ainda potencialmente desconhecidos. A informa\u00e7\u00e3o \nactualmente dispon\u00edvel diz respeito principalmente aos seus efeitos para a \nsa\u00fade humana. Comparativamente, tem sido desenvolvido pouco trabalho \nacerca do efeito nos sistemas ecol\u00f3gicos, especialmente na avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de risco \nem ecossistemas terrestres, existindo portanto uma necessidade de preencher \nesta lacuna. De entre as esp\u00e9cies de solo usadas em ecotoxicologia est\u00e3o os \nEnquitra\u00eddeos (Oligochaeta), membros importantes da fauna do solo, que \ncontribuem para a melhoria da sua estrutura porosa, e indirectamente na \ndegrada\u00e7\u00e3o da mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica. Al\u00e9m do facto de existir um protocolo padr\u00e3o \npara testar efeitos ao n\u00edvel da reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o e sobreviv\u00eancia (ISO, 2005), \nrecentemente a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de ferramentas que estudam efeitos ao n\u00edvel sub-\ncelular (Howcroft et al., 2008) e dos genes (Amorim et al., 2009) foi optimizada \ne est\u00e1 dispon\u00edvel, sendo uma vantagem competitiva em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a outras \nesp\u00e9cies padr\u00e3o. O principal objectivo deste estudo foi comparar os efeitos de \nnanopart\u00edculas de cobre com um sal de cobre (CuCl2), em Enchytaeus albidus, \nutilizando a an\u00e1lise da express\u00e3o gen\u00e9tica, e de biomarcadores de stress e \nneuronais como par\u00e2metro. Os resultados mostraram que a exposi\u00e7\u00e3o, tanto a \nnanopart\u00edculas de cobre como aos sais de cobre, causou altera\u00e7\u00f5es \nsignificativas nos biomarcadores e no perfil de express\u00e3o gen\u00e9tica. A an\u00e1lise \ndos biomarcadores mostrou a ocorr\u00eancia de danos oxidativos, causados por \nambas as formas de cobre (aos 8 dias de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o), e resposta anti-oxidante \n(GPx, GSH e GSSG) aos 4 dias. Tamb\u00e9m foi observado um efeito dependente \ndo tempo e da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o testada entre os tratamentos. No entanto, n\u00e3o \nhouve um biomarcador que permitisse discriminar entre tratamentos. Da \nan\u00e1lise dos efeitos ao n\u00edvel dos genes foi poss\u00edvel observar express\u00e3o \ndiferencial dos genes devido ao cobre (nano e sal). As principais fun\u00e7\u00f5es \nafectadas verificaram-se nos genes relacionados com a transcri\u00e7\u00e3o e tradu\u00e7\u00e3o, \nmetabolismo energ\u00e9tico e proteico, e resposta imunol\u00f3gica e de stress.

Current applications include \nelectronics, consumer products (e.g. cosmetics), medicine, environmental \nremediation and catalysts. Despite the increased use of nanomaterials, and \nconsequent disposal in the environment, their behavior and effects  are largely \nunknown. The current available information is mainly focused on the effetc on \nhuman health. Comparatively, little work has been done on ecological systems, \nespecially in the assesment of the environmental risk to terrestrial ecossystems \nand there is a need to fill this gap. Among soil species used in ecotoxicology \nare the Enchytraeids (Oligochaeta), important members of the soil fauna, \ncontributing to the improvement of the pore structure of the soil and, indirectly, \nto the degradation of the organic matter. Besides the fact that there is a \nstandard guideline for testing effects at the survival and reproduction level \n(ISO, 2005), recently, the use of tools that study the effect at the subcelular \n(Howcroft et al, 2008) and gene level (Amorim et al, 2009) have been optimized \nand became available, being a competitive advantage in comparison to other \nstandard species. The main goal of this research was to compare the effects of \nnanosized copper with Cu-salt (CuCl2), in Enchytareus albidus, using gene \nexpression, and oxidative stress and neuronal biomarkers as endpoints. The \nresults showed that exposure to nano-Cu and Cu-salt caused significative \nchanges on the biomarkers and the gene expression profile. Biomarkers \nanalysis indicate oxidative damage caused by both forms of copper (at 8 days \nof exposure), and an anti-oxidative response (GPx, GSH and GSSG) at 4 days. \nThere was also a time and concentration dependent effect between the \ntreatments. Nevertheless, there was not one biomarker that provided the best \ndiscrimination. The analysis of effects at gene level showed differently \nexpressed genes due to copper (nano or salt). Main functions affected were in \ntranscription and translation, energy and protein metabolism and immune and \nstress response related genes. Due to the reduced number of homologies to \nknown functions further explanations are difficult.  \nFrom results of both tools used there was no strong evidence of that one of the \nforms is significantly more toxic than the other, nevertheless these compounds \nseem to have different modes of action.  \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n i\n\nIndex \n\nChapter 1 ............................................................................................ 1 \n\nGeneral Introduction ........................................................................................... 3 \n\n1.

Introduction \u2013 Ecotoxicology and the use of molecular sciences \n \nThe term ecotoxicology was firstly used by Truhaunt, in 1969, as \u201cthe study of \n\nadverse effects of chemicals with the aim of protecting natural species and \n\npopulations\u201d (Twardowska 2004). This young branch of science has started to play \n\na crucial role in providing the key knowledge of sustainability (Twardowska 2004). \n\nSince the beginning, ecotoxicology was recognized as an interdisciplinary science, \n\nintegrating concepts of ecology, chemistry, biology, pharmacology, biochemistry \n\nand other disciplines. Nowadays, the main goal is not only the study of the effects, \n\nbut also the understanding of how chemical stressors might affect organisms at \n\nindividual, population and ecosystem levels (Hermens et al. 2004). This task \n\nbecomes complicated by the fact that chemicals do not act in isolation but interact \n\nwith non-chemical stressors (e.g. UV radiation, changes in temperature and CO2 \n\nconcentrations, pathogens, etc.) (Eggen et al. 2004; Hermens et al. 2004). Some \n\ndecades of environmental management have reduced the concentrations of many \n\nwell-known pollutants. The most recent challenges in ecotoxicology are related  to: \n\nlow concentrations of pollutants and long exposure periods (chronic effects), \n\nmultiple effects induced by single compounds, complex mixtures of pollutants, \n\nmultiple stressors (interaction between chemical and non-chemical stressors), and \n\necosystem complexity (Eggen et al. 2004). To deal with these challenges, a key \n\nelement is a focus on a mechanistic understanding of toxic effects as well as \n\ninteractions among stressors at multiple biological levels of organization (Eggen et \n\nal. 2004; Hermens et al. 2004). In this field, molecular approaches can provide a \n\nbetter understanding of underlying processes of ecotoxicology, necessary for this \n\nmechanism-based assessment of the risk and effects of stressors (Eggen et al. \n\n2004).  \n\n \n\nDuring the past two decades, considerable efforts have been dedicated to develop \n\nand applying biomarkers for use in ecotoxicology and ecological risk assessment \n\n(Forbes et al. 2006). These efforts have resulted in part for the need of early \n\nwarning indicators that respond before measurable effects on individuals and \n\n\n\n \n\n 4\n\npopulations occur (effects studied in traditional endpoints such as the impairment \n\non growth, survival and reproduction) and in part as an aid to identifying the \n\ncauses of effects observed at population and community level (Forbes et al. 2006). \n\nAccording to De Coen and co-authors (2000), biomarkers can be considered as \n\nmeasures of  the initial changes (effects) caused by the interactions between the \n\nstressor and the (biological) receptor site. This interaction induces cascades of \n\nevents starting at the sub-cellular level (e.g. disturbance of gene transcription, \n\ninterference with metabolic pathways) and ultimately leads to adverse effects at \n\nhigher level of biological organization. On the other hand, and despite biomarkers \n\nhave higher sensitivity and specificity at molecular and cytological levels, \n\nphysiological impairment are potentially the most effective markers for assessing \n\npollution as they can serve as precursors to effects in populations or communities, \n\nand so, ecologically relevant (Nicholson and Lam 2005). As the targets of \n\nprotection in ecological risk assessment most often are populations, communities \n\nand ecosystems, suites of biomarkers at different functional complexity (e.g. \n\nmolecular, cytological) coupled with measures of higher levels of biological \n\norganization are recommended in monitoring programmes, and the biomarker \n\nresponse must be consistently linked to responses at these higher levels. \n\nBecause, even if biomarkers were not able to provide reliable predictions of effects \n\nat higher levels of biological organization, they may reveal the mechanisms \n\nunderlying these effects (Forbes et al. 2006). Thus, to provide both an early \n\nwarning of pollution impacts and environmental relevance, measures of \n\nbioindicators (growth or reproductive output or energy utilization) should be \n\nassociated with the molecular biomarker response (Depledge and Fossi 1994) \n\n \n\n2. Test organism \n \n\nFor an adequate risk assessment, the appropriate selection of the test species is \n\ncrucial. To be considered as a potential indicator organism for the assessment of \n\nsoil quality, organisms should fulfil several criteria such as: play a key role in the \n\nfunctioning of the soil ecosystem, so that their response is relevant for conclusions \n\non the system level; be present in a wide range of ecosystems, to allow \n\n\n\n \n\n 5\n\ncomparisons between systems; occur abundantly, so that they are widely available \n\nand their response is readily recordable; be easy to use both in field and \n\nlaboratory conditions: they should be easily collectable and maintained in culture; \n\ncome into contact with a variety of stress factors, via the soil solution, the solid \n\nphase, and the gaseous phase in soil; and be sufficiently sensitive to a wide range \n\nof environmental stresses but not so sensitive that they easily become extinct \n\n(Didden and Rombke 2001). Enchytraeids readily fulfill the first five of these \n\ncriteria, thus they are useful as ecotoxicological test organisms (Didden and \n\nRombke 2001; Rombke 2003). \n\nEnchytraeids (Enchytraeidae) have been used in ecotoxicological laboratory tests \n\nfor more than 30 years (Rombke and Moser 2002). The enchytraeids belong to the \n\nsaprophagous mesofauna of the litter layer and the upper mineral soil. Through \n\ntheir feeding activity the soil assumes a fine-grained \u201ccrumb\u201d structure with an \n\noften higher stability than that of the bulk soil. Their digging activity (despite more \n\nlimited compared to most earthworms) may improve the small-scale water and air \n\nmanagement of soil, especially when population levels are high (J\u00e4nsch et al., \n\n2005). The family Enchytraeidae belongs to the order Oligochaeta (class Clitellata, \n\nphylum Annelida). There is about 200-300 species in Central Europe and 900 in \n\nworldwide (Jansch et al. 2005). In general, enchytraeids are small worms (1-40 \n\nmm), whitish, that reproduce sexually (but asexual fragmentation is also possible). \n\nThey feed on decomposed plant residues and microorganisms. The pH of soil, the \n\ncontent of organic matter and the soil moisture are factors that influence their \n\noccurrence as well as their reaction to stress factors (Rombke and Moser 2002). \n\nEnchytraeus albidus is one of the biggest and well-known specie of the genus and. \n\nIt is acidophobe (optimum pH between 6.8 to 7.0), likes a range of temperature \n\nbetween 15 to 20\u00baC, prefers 55 to 65% of dry mass (but is able to reproduce in \n\nsoils with moisture content as high as 90%), and the reproduction is inhibit when \n\nthe organic matter content is below 3% (Jansch et al. 2005). World-wide it occurs \n\nat places with a large amount of organic material, but can also be found at many \n\nsoil types. Individuals of E. albidus reproduce quickly, can be kept in various \n\nsubstrates and feed with different foods (Rombke and Moser 2002), that make \n\nthem so easy to keep in culture.  \n\n\n\n \n\n 6\n\n3. Test chemicals: copper (salt and nanosized form) \n \n\nCopper (Cu) is a trace metal, classified as an essential element for most living \n\norganism, since trace amounts of copper serve essential biological functions, \n\nincluding respiration and oxidative stress protection by cytochrome oxidase and \n\nCu, Zn-superoxide dismutase, respectively (Yasokawa et al. 2008). Nevertheless, \n\nin high concentrations it can be a very toxic pollutant, including for Enchytraieds \n\n(Amorim et al. 2008; Amorim et al. 2005; Maraldo et al. 2006) and earthworms \n\n(Scott-Fordsmand et al. 2000). Copper is sometimes detected in soil and water as \n\na heavy metal pollutant close of mines and industrial areas, for e.g., at Hygum site \n\nin Denmark, soil copper concentration can reach up to 3,400 mg/Kg due to timber \n\npreservation with CuSO4 (Maraldo et al. 2006).  \n\nThrough the Haber-Weiss reaction, copper ions can catalyze the conversion of \n\nhydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to the powerful oxidant hydroxyl radical (OH?), causing \n\noxidative damage to lipids, DNA and proteins (Bremner 1998).   \n\nThe recent investigation performed in \u2013omics area allowed the unravel of \n\nmolecular mechanisms underling copper toxicity (Bundy et al. 2008). Sublethal \n\nconcentrations of copper caused mitochondrial dysfunction. As a result of this, the \n\namount of energy available from oxidative phosphorylation is reduced resulting in \n\na switch to metabolism of stored carbohydrates. Also, mitochondrial dysfunction \n\nleads to an increase in generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In higher \n\nlevels o biological organization, the reduction in body weight was observed (Bundy \n\net al. 2008). Also, genes coding for proteins involved in general response to \n\nmetals, as metallothioneins and heat shock proteins were also found up-regulated \n\nin response to copper exposure (Bundy et al. 2008; Muller et al. 2007).  \n\nAll these studies were performed with copper in its soluble form. Until the moment, \n\nvery little is known about copper nanoparticles and their effects in the \n\nenvironment. An overview of the work performed in \u2013nano field is given in the next \n\nchapter, including the work done with nano-copper. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 7\n\n4. Objectives \n\nThe main aim of this work was to compare the effects of copper nanoparticles with \n\ncopper salt (CuCl2) on Enchytraeus albidus using two different approaches: \n\nresponse of stress and neuro-muscular biomarkers, and gene expression analysis. \n\nTherefore, the present thesis is organized in two main chapters (papers) and \n\ngeneral conclusion: \n\n? Chapter 1: Introduction to ecotoxicology and use of molecular techniques \n\nin this science, test species, test chemicals and objectives of the thesis. \n\n?

Nanotechnology \n \n\nDespite their increasing utilization, few formal definitions of nanoparticles have \n\nbeen published. The most often used is the definition of nanotechnology. For \n\nexample, The Royal Society &amp; The Royal Academy of Engineering (The Royal \n\nSociety &amp; The Royal Academy of Engineering 2004) defines nanotechnology as \n\n\u201cthe design characterization, production and application of structures, devices and \n\nsystems by controlling shape and size at the nanometer scale\u201d. The Interagency \n\nSubcommittee on Nanoscale Science, Engineering and Technology (NEST) has \n\nproposed a similar definition: \u201cNanotecnhology is the creation and the use of \n\nmaterials, devices and systems through the control of matter on the nanometer-\n\nlength scale at the level of atoms, molecules and supramolecular structures\u201d \n\n(Report of the National Nanotechnology Initiative Workshop 2003). Currently, \n\nnanomaterials (NMs) are defined as materials with a size range between 1 and \n\n100 nm, in at least one dimension (Fig 1). More recently, a good working definition \n\nof nanomaterials mentions not only their size range but also their exhibition of \n\nnovel properties (Borm et al. 2006; Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution \n\n2008).  \n\n\n\n \n\n 14\n\n Figure 1: Length scale showing the nanometer in context (The Royal Society &amp; \n\nThe Royal Academy of Engineering 2004). \n\n \n\nNanomaterials can have one, two or three dimensions in the nanoscale. Materials \n\nhaving only one dimension in the nanoscale are layers such as surface coatings \n\nand thin films. Those which are nanoscaled in two dimensions include nanowires \n\nand nanotubes. And those which are nanoscaled in three dimensions are usually \n\nknown as nanoparticles (NPs) and include colloids, quantum dots and \n\nnanocrystalline materials (Fig. 2) (The Royal Society &amp; The Royal Academy of \n\nEngineering,(The Royal Society &amp; The Royal Academy of Engineering 2004); \n\nRoyal Commission on Environmental Pollution, (Royal Commission on \n\nEnvironmental Pollution 2008).  \n\n\n\n \n\n 15\n\n \n\nFigure 2: Tridimensional representation of C60 Buckminsterfullerene (also known \n\nas fullerene). It is a spherical molecule, with 1 nm of diameter, which comprises 60 \n\ncarbon atoms arranged as the corners of 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons. It is \n\nperhaps the best known NP.  \n\nhttp://www.3dchem.com/moremolecules.asp?ID=217&amp;othername=Buckminsterfullerene   \n\n \n \n2. Applications of nanomaterials \n \nNanomaterials are widely used in skin care products (titanium dioxide, iron oxide \n\nand other metal oxides); in structural applications such as coatings (titanium \n\ndioxide), catalysts and ceramics (silicon nitride and silicon carbide); in electronics \n\n(single walled nanotubes and metal oxides); in biotechnology on targeted drug \n\ndelivery and biosensors; and in environmental remediation (Royal Comission on \n\nEnvironmental Pollution 2008; The Royal Society &amp; The Royal Academy of \n\nEngineering 2004). At present, more than 800 nanotechnology-based consumer \n\nproducts are available in the market (Fig. 3) and the most common NMs used in \n\nconsumer products are silver, carbon (which include fullerens), zinc (including zinc \n\noxide), silica, titanium (including titanium dioxide) and gold (The Project on \n\nEmerging Technologies, 2009).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 16\n\n \n \n\nFigure 3: Number of consumer products, available in March 2008, containing \n\nnanomaterials. The products are grouped in categories (Health and Fitness, Home \n\nand Garden, Electronics and Computers, Food and Beverage, Cross Cutting, \n\nAutomotive, Appliances and Goods for Children).  \n\nhttp://www.nanotechproject.org/inventories/consumer/analysis_draft/  \n\n \n\nDespite copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) not being included in the most commonly \n\nused NMs (Fig. 4), they are being given considerable attention due to their \n\ninteresting properties (e.g. high electrical and thermal conductivities) and potential \n\napplications in many areas of industry. Nowadays, metallic Cu NPs are used in \n\nmodern electronic circuits (e.g. chip-package interconnections (Tummala et al. \n\n2006) and conductive inks for printing electronic components (Lee et al. 2008b)), \n\nmetallurgy, catalysis (Dhas et al. 1998; Samim et al. 2007) and sensors \n\n(Athanassiou et al. 2006).  \n\n\n\n \n\n 17\n\n  \n\nFigure 4: TEM micrograph of copper nanoparticles at two different magnifications: \n\n(a) bar = 300 nm, (b) bar = 40 nm (Dhas et al., 2008). \n\n \n\nIt is believed that NMs utilization will dramatically increase in the next few years  \n\n(The Royal Society &amp; The Royal Academy of Engineering 2004). Such increase in \n\nutilization will probably result in the entry of nonmaterial\u2019s wastes in the \n\nenvironment, which is scientist\u2019s main concern, because their effects and \n\nenvironmental behavior are largely unknown. In this context it appears the \n\ndefinition of Nanotoxicology as \u201cthe science of engineered nanodevices and \n\nnanostructures that deals with their effects in living organisms\u201d (Oberdorster et al. \n\n2005). \n\n \n3. Novel properties and entry in the environment \n \n\nTheir small size and consequent larger surface area confer specific properties to \n\nnanomaterials. Increasing of surface reactivity predicts that NMs will exhibit \n\ngreater biological activity per given mass comparatively to the respective bulk \n\nmaterials and that the interaction of nanoparticles with cells and their structures \n\nare likely to be very different from those of larger-sized particles (Oberdorster et al. \n\n2005). With a reduction in size, several properties can be dramatically changed, \n\nfor e.g. electrical conductivity, magnetic characteristics, hardness and, as \n\nmentioned above, active surface area, chemical reactivity and biological activity  \n\n(Nel et al. 2006). The surface charge is an other characteristic that can change at \n\nthe nanoscale. It is important because it determines the solubility and aggregation \n\nof nanomaterials which are key factors in determination of their fate and behavior \n\nin the environment (Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution 2008). These \n\na) b) \n\n\n\n \n\n 18\n\nproperties have been explored for the different uses of nanomaterials, but can also \n\nbecome unwanted because of the possibility of causing toxic effects  \n\nManufactured nanomaterials can reach the environment trough intentional \n\nreleases (e.g. use of nanoparticles to remediate contaminated soil) as well as \n\nunintentional releases such as production facilities effluents and atmospheric \n\nemissions (Klaine et al. 2008; Oberdorster et al. 2005). Humans\u2019 uptake of \n\nnanoparticles can follow three main routes: inhalation (respiratory tract), ingestion \n\n(digestive tract) and dermal absorption (skin) (Oberdorster et al. 2005). Their \n\nuptake by organisms in the environment depends on a variety of processes that \n\nmodify nanomaterials properties (e.g. aggregation, morphology and degradation)  \n\n(Klaine et al. 2008; Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution 2008). Also, the \n\ndifferent environmental matrices, such as air, soil/sediments, freshwater and \n\nseawater are very complex, leading to an increased difficulty in predicting NMs \n\nbehaviour and toxicity (Handy et al. 2008). In figure 5 the routes of exposure, \n\nuptake, distribution and degradation of NMs in the environment are summarized.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5: Routes of exposure, uptake, distribution, and degradation of NPs in the \n\nenvironment. Solid lines indicate routes that have been demonstrated in the \n\nlaboratory or field or that are currently in use (remediation). Magenta lettering \n\nindicates possible degradation routes, and blue lettering indicates possible sinks \n\nand sources of NPs (Oberdorster et al. 2005). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 19\n\n4. Ecotoxicology of nanomaterials: state of the art \n \nSo far, most of the nanotoxicology studies are focused on human health (e.g. \n\n(Handy and Shaw 2007; Kreyling et al. 2006; Lewinski et al. 2008), especially on \n\nthe effects of nanoparticles to respiratory system (e.g. (Borm and Kreyling 2004; \n\nDonaldson). Among the few published ecotoxicological studies with NMs or NPs, \n\nnearly all of these have been performed in organisms from the aquatic \n\ncompartment, such as daphnids, zebrafish and algae. These studies refer to acute \n\nand chronic effects of several nanoparticles e.g. fullerenes (Lovern and Klaper \n\n2006; Lovern et al. 2007; Oberdorster 2004; Zhu et al. 2006), TiO2 and other metal \n\noxides (Heinlaan et al. 2008; Hund-Rinke and Simon 2006; Lovern and Klaper \n\n2006; Lovern et al. 2007; Velzeboer et al. 2008).

Some \n\necotoxicological studies reported the induction of oxidative stress after exposure to \n\nfullerenes (Oberdorster 2004; Zhu et al. 2006; Zhu et al. 2008), TiO2 (Federici et \n\nal. 2007) and carbon black NPs in fish species (Canesi et al. 2008). In the study \n\nperformed by Zhu and co-authors (2008) the levels of both SOD and CAT \n\nactivities (the primary defense against ROS) were significantly induced in the liver \n\n\n\n \n\n 26\n\nof juvenile carp for all the concentrations of C60 tested (0.04, 0.2 and 1 mg/L). In \n\ngill and brain tissues, the other organs tested, only CAT was induced, suggesting \n\nthat the liver is the target or the most susceptible organ to the C60 exposure. \n\nHowever, studies performed with different nanoparticles and different test species \n\n(TiO2 in rainbow trout and Cu in zebra fish) reported the gill as the primary organ \n\naffected by NPs exposure (Federici et al. 2007; Griffitt et al. 2007). In a study with \n\nblue mussels\u2019 hemocytes (Canesi et al. 2008) it was showed that carbon black \n\nNPs (NCB) entered into hemocytes in a dose-dependent way, and caused \n\noxidative stress to the cells (stimulating the release of lysossomal hydrolytic \n\nenzymes, oxidative burst and nitric oxide production) and inflammatory response \n\n(mediated by activation of stress-activated MAPK members). This is the only \n\necotoxicological study that simultaneously reports cell internalization and oxidative \n\ndamage after NMs exposure. However, investigation is needed to allow the \n\ncorrelation between the modulation of antioxidant enzymes and physiological \n\nresponses (e.g. survival, growth and reproduction). \n\nSome other studies reported the assimilation and/or bioaccumulation of NMs by \n\nexposed organisms. Kashiwada (2006) results showed that fluorescent \n\npolystyrene microspheres were visible in exposed eggs of medaka, and persist in \n\nthe larvae spawned from exposed eggs. The accumulation was size dependent \n\nand higher for particles with 474 nm (when testing sizes of 39.4, 474, 932, 18600 \n\nand 42000 nm).  An other study performed by Asharani and co-authors (2008) \n\nshowed that silver (Ag) NPs (capped with BSA or starch), with a size ranging \n\nbetween 5-20 nm, entered in the chorion of zebrafish embryos and were toxic in a \n\ndose-dependent way. Ag NPs exposure also caused a decrease in heart rate and \n\nhatching as well as severe malformations. Cheng and co-authors (2007) have \n\nstudied the effects of carbon nanotubes in zebrafish embryos. According to their \n\nresults no effects on mortality or embryonic development occurred, whereas a \n\nhatching delay was observed. They also showed that chorion forms a barrier \n\nprotecting zebrafish embryos from the aggregates of single-walled carbon \n\nnanotubes (in the range of 10 \u00b5m\n2\n) which were to large to enter the chorion. \n\nAlso in aquatic ecotoxicology, the toxicity of NMs has been related to their action \n\nas vectors for the transport of other chemicals. Zhang and co-authors (2007) \n\n\n\n \n\n 27\n\nresults showed that TiO2 NPs adsorb to cadmium (Cd) increasing its accumulation \n\nin carp. Nano-TiO2 facilitated the transport of Cd ions in a positive correlation \n\nbetween Cd and TiO2 concentrations. As showed by Baun and co-authors (2008) \n\nC60 easily adsorb to phenanthrene (85%) while only 10% of atrazine, methyl-\n\nparathion and pentachlorophenol adsorb to C60. The toxicity of phenanthrene to \n\nalgae was increased following sorption to C60 aggregates, but decreased in \n\ndaphnids. The toxicity of pentachlorophenol decreases in both organisms tested \n\nwith the addition of C60. This study shows that the interaction between NMs/NPs \n\nand other chemicals, which will eventually occur in natural environments, should \n\nbe taken into account in the nano-ecotoxicology research. \n\nThe effects of C60 at lethal and sublethal levels are relatively well studied in \n\nbacteria. Thong and co-authors (2007) results showed that the introduction of C60 \n\nhas no significant impact in soil microbial communities. No significant differences \n\ncould be observed between controls and treated samples in terms of soil \n\nrespiration, microbial biomass and soil enzymatic activities. Johansen and co-\n\nauthors (2008) results showed that 0.5, 25 or 50 mg/Kg of soil of C60 only inhibit \n\nthe growth of fast-growing bacteria, which have recovered until the end of \n\nexposure (23 days).  Studies on microbial effects have also been performed in \n\nwater with C60 (Fortner et al. 2005). Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria \n\nwere exposed to 0,04mg/L and 4mg/L of C60:  no effect on bacterial growth was \n\nobserved at the smaller concentration of C60 and there was a complete inhibition of \n\ngrowth in the highest concentration. These studies indicate that different exposure \n\nmedia (water or soil) have an important role in ecotoxicity of NPs. Lyon and co-\n\nauthors (2006) have studied the effects of C60 water suspensions, on Bacillus \n\nsubtilis, prepared by four different methods. Their results showed that despite all \n\nthe suspensions possessed antibacterial activity, some of them were more potent \n\nthan others, which is in accordance with other studies showing that different \n\nmethods of NMs/NPs preparation could lead to differences in toxicity (Lovern and \n\nKlaper 2006; Zhu et al. 2006). \n\nHeinlaan and co-authors (2008) performed a study comparing the effects of \n\nseveral sizes (bulk, nano and ionic) of different particles (CuO, ZnO and TiO2) to \n\nthe bacteria Vibrio fischeri and the crustaceans Thamnocephalus platyurus and D. \n\n\n\n \n\n 28\n\nmagna. Their results showed that there were no pronounced differences between \n\nthe tree forms of Zn and TiO2 was not toxic. In the Cu group, different forms of the \n\nmaterial caused different effects (to e.g. V. fischeri EC50 of 1.6 mg/L to CuSO4, 76 \n\nmg/L to nano CuO and 3811 mg/L to CuO).  \n\nSome studies were focused on nanosized copper. Results from Griffit and co-\n\nauthors (2007) showed that the gill was the primary target and no evidence for \n\ndamage to other organs was observed. Exposure to nanocopper caused inhibition \n\nof Na\n+\n/K\n\n+\n ATPase activity and a slight increase of plasma urea nitrogen (BUN) \n\nlevels. Acute toxicity evaluation results showed that copper sulfate (soluble \n\ncopper) was more toxic than nanocopper with a 48h EC50 of 0,25 mg Cu/L. \n\nMicroarray results showed that 48h exposure to sub lethal concentrations of \n\nnanocopper resulted in 82 genes significantly differently expressed and that the \n\ntranscriptional response induced by nanocopper was divergent from the one that \n\nwas generated by the soluble copper, which means that the effects caused by \n\nnanocopper are not only due to solubility. The only knew study about the toxicity of \n\ncopper NPs to terrestrial organisms was performed in plants (Phaseolus radiatus \n\nand Triticum aestivum), but in agar media instead of soil, by Lee and co-authors \n\n(2008a). Their results showed that exposure to Cu NPs caused a reduction in \n\nseedling growth of both test species, although P. radiatus was more sensitive with \n\nan EC50 value of 335 mg/L compared to 570 mg/L of T. aestivum. Bioaccumulation \n\nof nano Cu was observed in both plants (in the cytoplasm and cell wall of the root \n\ncells) and it was concentration dependent. To ensure that the toxic effect caused \n\nwas the result of Cu NPs and not due to their solubility, the amount of cupric ions \n\nreleased during the preparation of Cu NPs was measured. The results showed \n\nthat 1 mg/L of Cu nanoparticles released 0.3 mg/L of cupric ions, which was \n\nsubsequently proved as non toxic to the test plants.   \n\nDespite the fact of not being mentioned in the table above, because they are about \n\ntoxicology (to humans) and not ecotoxicology, there are some interesting studies \n\nreporting the effects of nano-Cu. Chen and co-authors (2006) and Meng and co-\n\nauthors (2007) performed studies with mice. The results of the first study indicated \n\nthat nanocopper (such as ion copper particles) is moderately toxic with 48h EC50 \n\nof 414 mg/kg body weight and micro-copper is nearly non-toxic. Pathological \n\n\n\n \n\n 29\n\nexaminations revealed that kidney, liver and spleen are target organs for Cu NPs, \n\nsuffering serious injuries also demonstrated by measurements of the blood \n\nbiochemical indexes (BUN, Cr, TBA and ALP). Both studies explain the toxicity of \n\nnanocopper as a result of massive formation of copper ions, consumption of H\n+\n \n\nand formation of HCO\n3-\n\n. Nanocopper reacts with hydrogen ions of gastric juice \n\nresulting in formation of Cu ions and HCO\n3-\n\n (leading to the alkanescence of the \n\nmedium). The overload of copper ions causes damage on the hepatic cells and \n\nthe alkanescence of the medium reduces the solubility of copper salts that is \n\ndeposited in the kidney. An other study (Karlsson et al. 2008) compares the \n\ntoxicity of several metal oxide nanoparticles (including CuO) and carbon \n\nnanotubes to human lung epithelial cells. Their results showed that between CuO, \n\nTiO2, ZnO, CuZnFe2O4, Fe2O3, Fe3O4, carbon and nanotubes nanoparticles, the \n\nnano CuO (which was not the smaller NP) was the one that caused more damage \n\nin all the parameters evaluated, which includes percentage of non-viable cells, \n\noxidative DNA lesions, DNA damage and intracellular ROS. It was also compared \n\nthe effect of CuO NPs and Cu ions (CuCl2) in the same cell line and the results \n\nshowed that nano CuO was much more toxic than CuCl2. The most important \n\nfinding in this study was the high toxicity and ability of nano CuO to cause DNA \n\ndamage and oxidative stress, because Cu NPs are widely used in several \n\nindustries and their toxicity has not been sufficiently investigated.  \n\n \n\n5. Knowledge gaps and future perspectives \n \n\nIn the current literature available, the reported effect concentrations are often very \n\ndifferent, not only between laboratories using similar tests and organisms, but also \n\ndepending on the method used to prepare the NMs for testing. On the other hand, \n\nbased on the current understanding, the traditional methods used to assess the \n\nchemical toxicity are a good starting point for NMs/NPs testing. However new test \n\nstrategies need to be delineated to lead with the novel toxicity mechanisms that \n\ncan emerge from NMs/NPs (Nel et al. 2006). To adequately manage NMs in the \n\nenvironment, quantitative measures of both exposure and effects are needed. To \n\nenable the progression of the study about the NMs/NPs behavior, fate and effects \n\n\n\n \n\n 30\n\nin the environment, Klaine and co-authors (Klaine et al. 2008) recommended the \n\nharmonization of several issues: \n\n. availability of standardized and characterized materials to researchers; \n\n. development of standardized methods to the creation of test media (both \n\nsoil/sediment or water) for conducting fate and effects testing; \n\n. standardization of characterization requirements for particles and particle \n\nsuspensions. \n\nThat will give scientists the minimum information requirements to interpret their \n\nown and others results. Also needed is the development of high-sensitive \n\ntechniques capable of the measurement of NMs in the environment (against a high \n\nbackground of naturally-occurring materials) to allow the testing of realistic \n\nexposure scenarios, including relevant test species (Royal Comission on \n\nEnvironmental Pollution 2008). Figure 6 schematizes the key challenges and \n\nknowledge gaps in the ecotoxicology of NMs that must be fulfilled to perform a \n\ncorrect environmental risk assessment and monitoring. \n\n \n\nFigure 6: Key challenges and knowledge gaps in the ecotoxicology of NPs and NMs. At \n\nthis early stage, some uncertainty in data interpretation seems likely given the need for \n\nmethod development in both the ecotoxicology and chemistry. Investigation is needed \n\nabout the behaviour of NMs in natural matrices (soil, air, freshwater (FW) and seawater \n\n(SW)). Also, the large variety of nanoproducts, and lack of knowledge on adverse effects \n\non a wide variety of wildlife, adds uncertainty about what products to prioritise for risk \n\n\n\n \n\n 31\n\nassess first; and whether or not the concept of protecting \u2018\u2018most of the organisms most of \n\nthe time\u2019\u2019 is achievable in the immediate future (Handy et al. 2008). \n\n \n\nDespite all the recent investigation performed in order to demonstrate the possible \n\neffects of NMs, the truth is that the largest fraction refers to the human concern. \n\nAlthough most people are concerned with effects on large wildlife (particularly the \n\nhuman being), the basis of many food chains depends on the benthic and soil flora \n\nand fauna, which could be dramatically affected by NMs release in the \n\nenvironment (Oberdorster et al. 2005). It is generally accepted that research is \n\nneeded in water and soil ecosystems, but since the ultimate sink of NMs may be \n\nsediment and soil it is of outmost importance to study the effects on terrestrial \n\nenvironment and organisms (Klaine et al. 2008). \n\n \n\n6.

Despite the increased use of nanomaterials, their behaviour and \neffects in the environment are largely unknown. The information currently \navailable is mostly focused on effects on human health and comparatively very \nlittle is known in ecological systems, terrestrial in particular. Enchytraeids \n(Oligochaeta) are important members of the soil fauna that indirectly contribute to \nthe regulation and degradation of organic matter. These organisms are used in \nstandard testing (ISO 2003) and the measurement of several biomarkers has \ncurrently been optimized for this species (Howcroft et al. 2009). In the present \nstudy, the main goal was to compare the effects of ionic copper versus copper \nnanoparticles in Enchytraeus albidus assessing the effect at the biomarker level, \ntesting different concentrations and exposure time. Measured parameters were \nlipid peroxidation (LPO), total, reduced and oxidized glutathione content (TG, GSH \nand GSSG), the enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase \n(CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-\ntransferase (GST) and cholinesterases (ChEs). Results showed that both salt- \nand nano-copper caused oxidative stress and damage to E. albidus, and effects \ncould be discriminated between the copper forms. Nevertheless and despite the \nvisible discrimination between nano and the salt form (time and exposure \ndependent), there was not one or a set of biomarkers that provided the best \ndiscrimination. \n \nKeywords: oxidative stress, enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, copper \n\nnanoparticles, copper, Enchytraeids \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 40\n\n \n\n1. Introduction \n \n\nCopper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) are being given considerable attention due to their \n\nproperties e.g. high electrical and thermic conductivities. Cu NPs are used in \n\nmodern electronic circuits e.g. chip-package interconnections (Tummala et al. \n\n2006) and conductive inks for printing electronic components (Lee et al. 2008b), \n\nmetallurgy, catalysis (Dhas et al. 1998; Samim et al. 2007) and sensors \n\n(Athanassiou et al. 2006)).  Increased use of nanomaterials will lead to their \n\npossible distribution in the environment, including the potential to contaminate soil, \n\nmigrate into surface and groundwater, and interact with biota (Klaine et al. 2008). \n\nDespite the increased interest and recent investigation in this area, very little is \n\nknown about the environmental effects and behaviour of nanoparticles especially \n\nfor terrestrial ecosystems (Klaine et al. 2008). \n\nThe available information about the ecotoxicology of nanoparticles includes mainly \n\nstudies in organisms of the aquatic compartment (Fortner et al. 2005; Griffitt et al. \n\n2007; Heinlaan et al. 2008; Hund-Rinke and Simon 2006; Lovern and Klaper 2006; \n\nLovern et al. 2007; Oberdorster 2004; Velzeboer et al. 2008; Zhu et al. 2006; Zhu \n\net al. 2008), with very few studies on soil organisms (Johansen et al. 2008; Scott-\n\nFordsmand et al. 2008a; Scott-Fordsmand et al. 2008b; Tong et al. 2007; Lee et \n\nal. 2008a)).   \n\nDespite the fact that copper is an essential element for most living organisms it is \n\nalso well documented to cause toxicity in various organisms, including the \n\nenchytraeid E. albidus (Amorim et al. 2008; Amorim et al. 2005; Howcroft et al. \n\n2009). Copper is known to cause oxidative damage, catalysing the formation of \n\nhydroxyl radicals via the Haber-Weiss reaction (Bremner 1998): O2\u00b7 - + Cu2+ ? \n\nO2 + Cu+ ; Cu+ + H2O2 ? Cu2+ + OH- + OH\u00b7 . To protect organisms from \n\noxidative stress there are antioxidant defences, present in all aerobic organisms, \n\nwhich include antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione \n\nperoxidases and glutathione reductase) and free radical scavengers (vitamins C \n\nand E, carotenoids, glutathione) whose function is to remove reactive oxygen \n\nspecies (ROS) (Doyotte et al. 1997). Enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants \n\nplay a crucial role in maintaining cell homeostasis. Thus the balance between \n\n\n\n \n\n 41\n\nprooxidant endogenous and exogenous factors and antioxidant defences in \n\nbiological systems can be used to assess toxic effects under stressful \n\nenvironmental conditions (Howcroft et al. 2009). \n\nComparatively, very little is known about the effects of copper nanoparticles. \n\nStudies reporting acute toxicity results comparing ionic copper with copper \n\nnanoparticles show that the first was more toxic to mice ( LD50 of 110 and 413 \n\nmg/Kg respectively) (Chen et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2006; Meng et al. 2007) and \n\nzebrafish (EC50 of 0.25 mg/L and 1.6 mg/L respectively)(Griffitt et al. 2007). \n\nMicroarray experiments (Griffitt et al. 2007) showed that 48h exposure to sub \n\nlethal concentrations of nanocopper resulted in 82 genes significantly differently \n\nexpressed and that the transcriptional response induced by nanocopper was \n\ndivergent from the one that was generated by the soluble copper, which suggests \n\nthat the effects caused by nanocopper are not only due to solubility.  \n\nIn the present study the effect of two copper forms in Enchytaeus albidus, copper-\n\nsalt and nanosized copper, were assessed and compared. Enchytraeids \n\n(Oligochaeta) are important members of the soil fauna that have been used in \n\necotoxicological laboratory tests for more than 30 years (Rombke and Moser \n\n2002) and have established standard guideline (ISO 2003). They are ecologically \n\nrelevant, being abundant in many soils contributing to the improvement of the pore \n\nstructure of the soil and, indirectly, to the degradation of the organic matter. Effects \n\nwere assessed in terms of oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation, superoxide \n\ndismutase, catalase, glutathione_total, oxidized and reduced, glutathione \n\nreductase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase) and neuro-\n\nmuscular (cholinesterases) biomarkers. Additionally, three different exposure \n\ntimes (2, 4 and 8 days) and two exposure concentrations of copper and nano \n\ncopper were analysed.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 42\n\n2. Material and Methods \n \n2.1. Test organism \n \n\nThe test organism used belongs to the species Enchytraeus albidus, Henle 1837. \n\nThe individuals were maintained in laboratory cultures under controlled conditions, \n\ne.g. photoperiod 16:8h light:dark and a temperature of 18\u00baC. Details of culturing \n\nare given in (Rombke and Moser 2002). \n\n \n\n2.2. Test soil \n \nThe test soil used was from the natural site in Hygum, Denmark. Soil was \n\nhomogenized and sterilized. The general physico-chemical characteristics of soil \n\nfrom the Hygum-site are as follows: 20-32% coarse sand (>200Am), 20-25% fine \n\nsand (63- 200Am), 11-20% coarse silt (20-63Am), 12-20% silt (20-20Am), 12-16% \n\nclay (<2Am) and 3.6-5.5% humus. The soil was sampled to a depth of 20 cm. To \n\nexclude soil animals already present, the soil was dried at 80\u00b0C for 24 h in an oven \n\n(Memmert, Type UL40, Braunschweig, Germany) and then sieved through a 2-mm \n\nmesh to remove larger particles.  \n\n \n\n2.3. Chemical substances \n \n\nThe nanoparticles were made of Cu with a mean diameter of 80 nm, (PW-XRD \n\n<74 nm, DLS = 419\u00b11 nm, Zeta = 15.3\u00b10.3) and a purity of 99.5%. The \n\nnanoparticles were added to the soil following transfer to deionised water and \n\nultrasonic-steering for 15 min. The Cu-salt was obtained from CuCl2 solubilised in \n\nwater. The concentrations used were 450 and 750 mg/Kg of copper and \n\nnanosized copper. \n\n \n\n2.4. Test procedure \n \n\nAfter homogeneous mixing, sub-samples of the batch of soil were introduced into \n\nthe test vessels. Fifteen adult worms with well developed clitellum were introduced \n\nin each test vessel, each containing 25 g moist soil (40 to 60% of the maximum \n\nWHC). The vessel was covered with a lid (containing small holes) and the worms \n\n\n\n \n\n 43\n\nwere exposed for two, four and eight days (in the absence of food) at 20\u00baC and a \n\n16:8h photoperiod. Seven replicates per treatment were used. At test end, animals \n\nof each replicate were carefully removed, rinsed in deionised water, weighed and \n\nfrozen in liquid Nitrogen. Samples were stored at -80\u00baC till further analysis. \n\n \n\n2.5. Biochemical analysis \n \n\nEach sample containing 15 organisms was homogenized in 1500\u00b5L K-Phosphate \n\n0,1M buffer, pH 7,4. Part of the tissue homogenate (300\u00b5L) was separated into a \n\nmicrotube with 5\u00b5L BHT (2,6-dieter-butyl-4-metylphenol) 4% in methanol for lipid \n\nperoxidation (LPO) determination. The remaining tissue homogenate (1200\u00b5L) of \n\neach sample was centrifuged at 10000g for 20 min at 4\u00baC, to isolate the Post-\n\nMithocondrial Supernatant (PMS). The PMS was divided into eight microtubes, \n\nstored at -80\u00baC, for posterior analysis of biomarkers and protein quantification. \n\n \n\n2.5.1. Determination of lipid peroxidation \n\n \n\nThe extent of LPO was measured as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances \n\n(TBARS) at 535nm (Bird and Draper 1984; Ohkawa et al. 1979).   \n\n \n\n2.5.2. Quantification of enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants \n\n \n\nSuperoxide Dismutase (SOD) activity was determined based on the reduction of \n\ncytochrome c by superoxide radicals generated by the xanthine-xanthine oxidase \n\nsystem. Measurements were recorded at 550nm (McCord and Fridovich 1969) \n\nadapted to microplate. Catalase (CAT) activity was measured following the \n\ndecrease in absorbance at 240nm due to H2O2 (substrate) decomposition \n\n(Clairborne 1985). Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx) activity was determined following \n\nthe oxidation of NADPH, at 340nm, when GSSG is reduced back to GSH by \n\nglutathione reductase, using H2O2 as substrate (Mohandas et al. 1984). \n\nGlutathione Reductase (GR) activity was measured assessing the decrease of \n\nNADPH level, at 340nm (Cribb et al. 1989). Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST) \n\nactivity was measured at 340nm, following the conjugation of GSH with CDNB (the \n\n\n\n \n\n 44\n\nsubstrate with the broadest range of GST isozymes detectability) (Habig et al. \n\n1974). For more details see (Howcroft et al. 2009). Total glutathione (TG, GSH + \n\nGSSG) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) were measured at 412 nm, using the \n\nrecycling reaction of reduced glutathione (GSH) with DTNB in the presence of GR \n\nexcess (Baker et al. 1990; Tietze 1969). 2-Vinyl-pyridine was used to conjugate \n\nGSH for the GSSG determination (Griffith 1980). The GSH content was calculated \n\nby subtraction of GSSG from the total glutathione. \n\n \n\n2.5.3. Quantification of Cholinesterases activity \n\n \n\nCholinesterases (ChEs) activity was measured using Ellman method (Ellman et al. \n\n1961) adapted to microplate (Guilhermino et al. 1996). ChE activity was \n\ndetermined in the PMS, using 50 \u00b5L of sample and 250 \u00b5L of reaction buffer (30 \n\nmL K-phosphate buffer 0.1 M pH 7.2, 1 mL DTNB 10 mM in K-phosphate buffer \n\nwith 7.5 mg NaHCO3 and 0.2 mL acetylthiocoline 0.075 M solution as the \n\nsubstrate). The absorbance was measured at 414 nm. \n\n \n\n2.5.4. Protein quantification \n\n \n\nProtein concentration was assayed using the Bradford method (Bradford 1976), \n\nadapted from BioRad's Bradford micro-assay set up in a 96 well flat bottom plate, \n\nusing bovine ?-globuline as a standard.    \n\n \n\n2.6. Statistical analysis \n \n\nThe main aim of this experiment was to analyse differences in response induction \n\nbetween the salt form (CuCl2) compared to the nano form (NP-Cu). Multivariate \n\nanalysis (Principal Component Analysis, PCA) was performed using SAS 9.1.3 \n\n(2002-2004). Data was standardized (mean between 0 and 1). Univariate \n\nstatistical analysis was also performed using the software SigmaPlot11 (SPSS, \n\n1997): one-way ANOVA (Dunnett's Method) was used to compare differences \n\nbetween control and treatments, for each individual exposure time. A t-test was \n\nused to compare differences between Cu versus Np-Cu within the same \n\n\n\n \n\n 45\n\nconcentration and different concentration of the same compound. One-way \n\nANOVA (Holm-Sidak) was used to compare differences due to different times of \n\nexposure.  \n\n \n\n \n\n3. Results \n \n\n3.1. Multivariate analysis \u2013 trends in data \n \nMultivariate analysis (Principal Component Analysis, PCA) was performed with the \n\naim of finding trends. Trends in PCA are based on the individual samples and not \n\non mean values as performed in the uni-variate analysis (see below). When \n\npooling all data the first three PCA axes explained 60-70% of the variation, with a \n\nclear indication of that data (graph not shown) were grouped according to \n\nexposure durations and exposure concentration. Analysis of the control organisms \n\nshowed a clear time related enzymatic response. Given this, the data were \n\nsubsequently treated in accordance with the test design i.e. analysing difference \n\nbetween Cu-NP and Cu-salt within all combinations (termed \u201ctreatment\u201d) of days \n\nand concentrations. For each of these treatments there was a clear discrimination \n\nbetween the three groups: the control, Cu-salt and Cu-NP exposed organisms \n\n(graph not shown), but in the subsequent description only the possible difference \n\nbetween the Cu-salt and Cu-NP is described as this is the main aim of the study. \n\nPerforming the PCA for each treatment showed that 70-80% of the variation could \n\nbe explained by the first three axis of the PCA.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 46\n\n \n\n-2 0 2\n\nPCR1\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\nP\n\nC\n\nR\n\n2\n\n-2 0 2\n\nPCR1\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\nP\n\nC\n\nR\n\n2\n\n-2 0 2\n\nPCR1\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\nP\n\nC\n\nR\n\n2\n\n \n\n-2 0 2\n\nPCR1\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\nP\n\nC\n\nR\n\n2\n\n-2 0 2\n\nPCR1\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\nP\n\nC\n\nR\n\n2\n\n-4 -2 0 2 4\n\nPCR1\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\nP\n\nC\n\nR\n\n2\n\n \n\nLPO SOD CAT GPx GR\n\nLegend\n\nGSH GSSG TG GST ChELPO SOD CAT GPx GR\n\nLegend\n\nGSH GSSG TG GST ChEGSH GSSG TG GST ChE\n \n\nFigure 1: PCA graphs for the combinations of exposure time and concentration. Red dots \n\nrepresent copper nanoparticles and green dots copper-salt. Top row figures show the \n\nconcentration of 450 mg/Kg at 2 days (A), 4 days (B) and 8 days (C);lower row figures \n\nshow the concentration of 750 mg/Kg  at 2 days (D), 4 days (E) and 8 days (F). The \n\nbiomarkers represented are: lipid peroxidation (LPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), \n\ncatalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), Glutathione reductase (GR), reduced \n\nglutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), total glutathione (TG), glutathione-S-\n\ntransferase (GST) and cholinesterases (ChE).   \n\n \nAs seen from the graphs, clear separation between Cu-salt (green dots) and NP-\n\nCu (red dots) exposed organisms (each dot representing one organism sample) \n\nwas possible for all except for day 4 of the 450mg Cu/kg exposed and for the day \n\n2 of the 750 mg Cu/kg exposed (see Fig 1). The separation pattern and which \n\nenzymes were correlated best with a discrimination, was both dependent on the \n\nexposure concentration and the exposure time, that is, no single enzymatic \n\nresponse could be used to identify either the Cu-salt or the NP-Cu at all \n\nconcentrations and times. For the 450 mg Cu/kg exposure, day 2 showed that the \n\nD E F \n\nA B C \n\n\n\n \n\n 47\n\ndiscrimination was best determined by the difference between GSSG, CAT GSH \n\nand TG. GSSG had a strong positive response (increase compared to Cu-NP) for \n\nthe Cu-salt, whereas CAT, GSH and TG had a strong positive response in the Cu-\n\nNP (increased compared to Cu-salt). LPO, SOD, GST, GR, GPx and ChE were of \n\nlittle importance in discriminating between the groups. For the latter group the \n\nLPO, SOD and GST displayed an inverse response to GR, GPx and ChE, that is, \n\nwhen the former group were high the latter was generally low. For day 4 of the \n\n450mg Cu/kg exposure, TG showed an opposite response to ChE and GST, and \n\nGSH, GR and GPx an opposite response to CAT, LPO, GSSG and SOD. No clear \n\nseparation of the group was possible.  A clear separation was possible for the two \n\ngroups in the day 8 exposure of the 450 mg Cu/kg.  In general there was a strong \n\npositive response of GPx, LPO, GST and SOD for NP-Cu exposed organisms and \n\na strong (although less strong) positive response of GSH for Cu-salt exposed \n\norganisms, compared of course to the other group. Although, not highly important \n\nfor discriminating between the two groups GR, CAT and GSSG showed an inverse \n\nresponse to TG and ChE.   \n\nFor the 750 mg Cu/kg exposure, it was not possible to make a clear separation of \n\nthe two groups for 2 days exposed organisms. For these organisms SOD and TG \n\nshowed an inverse response compared to GPx, CAT and inverse compared to \n\nGSH, and although not so strong GST, GR and ChE had an inverse response to \n\nLPO and GSSG.  For the day 4 exposure of the 750 mg Cu /kg CAT, LPO and \n\nChE showed a strong relationship with Cu-NP exposure with GSH showing an \n\ninverse relationship, GSH had a strong positive response in Cu-salts. Less clearly \n\ndiscriminating and less expressed in the Cu-salt organisms was GST and TG. Not \n\nimportant for discrimination between the two groups GR, SOD and GSSG had an \n\ninverse response compared to GPx. Finally for the day 8 of the 750 mg Cu/kg, the \n\nNP exposed organisms had a strong expression of GSSG, whereas for the Cu-salt \n\nGSH and GST, and to a lesser extend LPO and ChE was stronger expressed.  \n\nLittle important for discrimination GR, SOD and CAT was inversely expressed \n\ncompared to TG.         \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 48\n\n \n\n3.2.

Changes with higher level of significance \n\nwere observed in terms of increase in LPO levels (Fig. 2J) after 8 days of \n\nexposure, except for Cu-NP 750. Also at 8 days exposure, GSSG (Fig. 2B) was \n\nstimulated by Cu-NP treatments while GPx activity decreases (Fig. 2E), except for \n\nCu-NP 450. At 4 days exposure, GPx activity increases with concentration \n\nincrease and is higher for all NP versions. Similarly GSSG activity increases in \n\nboth concentrations of both chemicals, while GSH activity decreases (Fig. 2A).

Effects of copper-salt versus nanosized copper \n\n \n\nSome of the biomarkers assessed showed different responses depending on the \n\nchemical size applied (Cu or Cu-NP) (Fig. 2). At 2 days exposure, GR and GSH \n\nactivities (Fig. 2F, 2A) were more inhibited by Cu than by Cu-NP. The activity of \n\nCAT at 4 days exposure (Fig. 2G) was inhibited by Cu 750, which was significantly \n\ndifferent form Np-Cu 750. The same response, at 4 days exposure, was observed \n\nfor the biomarkers GR, SOD and ChE, being the activities significantly smaller \n\nwhen exposed at Cu 750 when compared to Cu-NP 750.  \n\n \n\n3.2.3. Effects of concentration (450 versus 750 mg/Kg)  \n\nThe different toxic concentration used caused different effects on some of the \n\nbiomarkers. SOD and ChE activities at 4 days exposure, were significantly \n\nreduced in Cu 750 in comparison to Cu 450. CAT levels, at 4 days of exposure \n\nwere reduced for the highest concentration of Cu and LPO levels, at 8 days of \n\nexposure were significantly higher for Cu 750 when compared to Cu 450. For the \n\nNPs, lower concentration has more effect than the highest on GSSG activity and \n\nLPO levels.  \n\n \n3.2.4. Effects of exposure time on biomarkers response \n\nAs mentioned before in the text, PCA analysis showed an exposure time related \n\nenzymatic response. Univariate analysis performed confirmed also that \n\nbiomarkers responses varied with the time of exposure: GPx activity on controls \n\nwas significantly different between the three exposure times. GR, GSH and TG \n\nactivity decreased on controls at 4 and 8 days of exposure. Cu 450 caused a \n\ndifferent response in SOD between 4 and 8 days, GSH and TG between 2 and 4 \n\ndays, GSSG different between the three times of exposure and LPO is different at \n\n8 days in comparison to 2 and 4 days. When exposed to Cu-NP 450, GSH, TG \n\nand GSSG activities were different between all exposure times, SOD activity was \n\n\n\n \n\n 51\n\ndifferent at 8 days, GR activity differed only at 2 days, CAT response differ \n\nbetween 2 and 4 days and LPO levels between 4 and 8 days. Cu 750 caused an \n\nincrease in SOD, LPO and ChE levels at 8 days; GPX activity was increased at 4 \n\ndays; CAT activity was different between all the times of exposure; GSH and TG \n\nresponses were different between 2 and 4 days and GSSG response differ \n\nbetween 4 and 8 days. Cu-NP 750 caused a GSH and TG responses that were \n\ndifferent between all the times of exposure; GSSG and LPO levels differ at 2 days, \n\ncomparing to 4 and 8 days; GPx activity was different between 2 and 4 days and \n\nGST between 2 and 8 days. \n\n \n\n4. Discussion \n \n\nThe subsequent discussion is based on the assumption that the effects present in \n\nthe Cu-NP exposed organisms is indeed caused by nano-copper fully or to some \n\nextend and not by dissolved Cu: it must however be realised that this may not be \n\nthe case but, at present, there is no method to verify and quantify this. \n\nNevertheless, the results do indicate which responses should be further studied to \n\ndiscriminate between Cu-salt and Cu-NP. It was observed (although not shown) \n\nthat the response in all the exposed organisms were different from that of the \n\ncontrols. \n\nResults show that both copper-salt and nano-copper caused changes in all \n\nparameters evaluated and in the different times of exposure, revealing that \n\norganisms are facing an oxidative stress status but this is changing over time. In \n\nfact, the biomarkers response showing the best discrimination of the nano and the \n\nsalt form was dependent on the exposure duration and concentration i.e. there \n\nwas not one biomarker that provided the best discrimination. \n\nThe current results show that SOD activity increased, after 8 days of exposure at \n\nCu-NP 450. SOD is an antioxidant enzyme that protects tissues against \n\nsuperoxide anion radical catalysing its conversion in H2O2, which is detoxified by \n\nCAT and GPx. Increased SOD activity as a response to metals, including copper, \n\nhas already been observed in several organism (Drazkiewicz et al. 2007; Jing et \n\nal. 2006; Sampaio et al. 2008).  \n\n\n\n \n\n 52\n\nA previous study performed with E. albidus exposed to Cu (320 mg/Kg) (Howcroft \n\net al. 2009) showed no differences in SOD activity, at 2 days and 3 weeks \n\nexposure. The differences found between the present results and literature could \n\nbe explained by the different soil type used (Gomes et al. 2009). Hygum soil \n\naffects reproduction, being itself a possible cause of stress. This fact can be a \n\npossible explanation to the fact that in our results the controls of GPx, GR, GSH \n\nand TG varied between times of exposure. The increase in GPx activity (a \n\ncommon response at hydroperoxides accumulation as will be discussed bellow) \n\nplus the inhibition of GR and GSH are signals of stress. The increased levels of \n\nLPO at 8 days of exposure, indicated that the organisms are suffering oxidative \n\ndamage and that the effects caused by copper-salt (Cu) were more pronounced \n\nthan those caused by nano-copper (Cu-NP), especially at the highest \n\nconcentration tested. The results show that the higher concentration of Cu caused \n\nsignificant increase in LPO levels while the same did not occur for Cu-NP. Results \n\nin LUFA 2.2 soil (Howcroft et al. 2009) show that the antioxidant defence \n\nprocesses in E. albidus were able to prevent oxidative damage (LPO) on short \n\nexposures to copper (2 days), but not after 3 weeks. Our data suggests that 8 \n\ndays of exposure at a sub-lethal concentration of copper (450 mg/Kg) are already \n\ncausing oxidative damage. \n\nCAT activity was inhibited at 4 days of exposure when exposed to Cu 750. CAT \n\nand GPx are antioxidant enzymes responsible for the detoxification of \n\nhydroperoxides (H2O2). It is suggested by Atli and co-authors (2006) that CAT \n\ninhibition may be related to the inactivation of the enzyme due to the direct binding \n\nof metal ions to \u2013SH groups on the enzyme molecule. It is also suggested that no \n\nchanges in CAT activity may be related to the increase in other antioxidant \n\nenzymes and/or substrates, such as GPx and GSH.  \n\nAt 4 days exposure, GPx increased as GSH decreased: attending to the fact that \n\nGPx activity comes as an attempt to detoxification of H2O2 (and other organic \n\nhydroperoxides) using GSH as substrate (and producing GSSG which is then \n\nregenerated into GSH by GR) (Thomas et al. 1990), the decrease in GSH activity \n\nobserved at 4 days of exposure can result from its use as substrate by GPx in its \n\nantioxidant activity. This can be supported by the fact that, at this time of exposure \n\n\n\n \n\n 53\n\nno significant changes were observed in GR, TG and GST. The results also show \n\nthat the depletion of GSH is not being compensated by GR, resulting in the \n\nincrease of GSSG observed.  \n\nNo changes occurred in ChEs, at any treatment or time of exposure. ChEs are a \n\ngroup of enzymes related with neuronal functions and in recent decades some \n\nstudies have been published regarding the effect of metals in AChE activity (the \n\nmain cholinesterase present in six earthworms\u2019 whole body (Rault et al. 2007)), \n\nbut results are contradictory:  Frascos\u2019 results (Frasco et al. 2005) show that \n\nmetals (including copper) caused AChE inhibition in vitro.  \n\nRegarding the different concentrations tested, Cu showed a dose effect, with the \n\nhighest concentration causing more effects than the lower. For Cu-NP, LPO levels \n\nwere higher for 450mg/kg (Cu-NP 750 did not cause lipid peroxidation). This could \n\nbe indicative of a bell-shape response which was already observed for other stress \n\nbiomarkers (Dagnino et al. 2007; Dazy et al. 2009), nevertheless it is hard to \n\nconfirm such conclusion without testing more concentrations.   \n\nIn general, the results seem to indicate that, at 2 days of exposure, the organisms \n\nstart to respond to the oxidative stress imposed by copper-salt and copper \n\nnanoparticles. At 4 days of exposure GPx was the main defence against oxidative \n\ndamage, for which E. albidus could not compensate for at 8 days of exposure \n\n(resulting in LPO increase). \n\nAt 4 days of exposure to 750 mg/kg differences between Cu and Cu-NP are very \n\npronounced, while those observed between the concentrations of 450mg/kg at 2 \n\ndays of exposure do not persist after that. Cu-salt exposure caused lower values \n\nof CAT compared to Cu-NP; attending to the fact that copper can bind directly to \n\nCAT that could mean that copper binding is higher for Cu-salt than for Cu-NP. \n\nReduced activity of CAT results in the accumulation of hydroperoxides, which can \n\nbe removed by GPx until a saturation point leading ultimately to the higher LPO \n\nlevels (observed at 8 days). On the other hand, higher values of CAT and GR at \n\nCu-NP in comparison to Cu-salt, associated with the activity of GPx, seem to have \n\navoided the ultimate cellular damage, LPO. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 54\n\n5. Conclusions \n \n\nBoth salt- and nano-copper caused oxidative stress and damage to E. albidus, and \n\neffects could be discriminated between the copper forms. Nevertheless and \n\ndespite the visible discrimination between nano and the salt form (time and \n\nexposure dependent), there was not one or a set of biomarkers that provided the \n\nbest discrimination. In general, effects of Cu-salt were more pronounced especially \n\nat LPO level. GPx seemed to be the main antioxidant acting against the stress \n\nimposed, and associated with GSH and GSSG were the biomarkers with more \n\nrobust response. The selected time intervals were adequate to follow the evolution \n\nof the stress response until oxidative damage. To better characterize these \n\nresponses a broader range of concentrations should be tested. Further research is \n\nneeded to link these effects with higher levels of biological organization. \n\n \n\n6. References \n \n\nAmorim, M.J.B.; Novais, S.; Rombke, J.; Soares, A.M.V.M.

Despite the increased utilization of nanoparticles, the \nbehavior and effects in the environment is largely unknown and few resources are \navailable for health and environmental effects studies. Enchytraeids are \nextensively used in studies of soil toxicology (ISO No. 16387, 2005) and recently, \na cDNA microarray for E. albidus, was developed and toxicogenomic studies are \nalso possible. These organisms are small worms that indirectly contribute to the \nregulation and degradation of organic matter, being ecologically relevant. In this \nstudy we compared the gene expression profiles of Enchytraeus albidus when \nexposed to copper-salt (CuCl2) and copper nanoparticles spiked soil. The worms \nwere exposed for 48 hours to a range of concentrations in soil. Microarray \nhybridizations revealed a different response patterns between copper-salt and \ncopper nanoparticles, with a higher number of differentially expressed genes due \nto the copper salt exposure, however the discrimination between copper \nnanoparticles and copper-salt was not possible, neither the unravelling of the \nunderlying mechanisms of toxicity.  \n \nKeywords: toxicogenomics, gene expression profile,\n\n \ncopper, copper \n\nnanoparticles, Oligochaeta  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 64\n\n1. Introduction \n \nNanotechnology is an emergent discipline with several applications (electronics, \n\nconsumer products, medicine, environmental remediation, and catalysts), with \n\nrapidly increasing investments from businesses and from governments in many \n\nparts of the world (The Royal Society &amp; The Royal Academy of Engineering 2004). \n\nThe use of nanomaterials is dramatically increasing and will continue over the next \n\nyears, producing \u201cnanowastes\u201d that will probably enter in the environment from \n\nmanufacturing effluent, from washing off consumer products or through landfills \n\nand other methods of disposal. Despite the fact that most people are concerned \n\nwith effects on large wildlife (particularly the human being), the basis of many food \n\nchains depends on the benthic and soil fauna and flora, which could be \n\ndramatically affected by the release of nanomaterials in the environment, whose \n\nbehavior and effects are largely unknown (Oberdorster et al. 2005). \n\nCopper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) have been given considerable attention due to \n\ntheir properties e.g. high electrical and thermic conductivities which make them \n\nvery useful in modern electronics (Lee et al. 2008b; Tummala et al. 2006), \n\nmetallurgy (Dhas et al. 1998; Samim et al. 2007) and catalysis. Copper is known \n\nto cause oxidative damage in organisms via the Haber-Weiss reaction, catalyzing \n\nthe formation of  the powerful oxidant hydroxyl radical (OH\u00b7) (Bremner 1998) and \n\nrecent investigation has shown that sublethal concentrations of copper caused \n\nmitochondrial dysfunction resulting in the reduction of the amount of energy \n\navailable and a switch to metabolism of stored carbohydrates (Bundy et al. 2008). \n\nThe environmental effects of copper nanoparticles are still poorly known. When \n\ncompared to soluble copper, copper nanoparticles were less toxic to mice ( LD50 \n\nof 110 and 413 mg/Kg respectively) (Chen et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2006; Meng et \n\nal. 2007) and zebrafish (EC50 of 0.25 mg/L and 1.6 mg/L respectively). Results \n\nobtained by Griffitt and co-authors (Griffitt et al. 2007) suggests that the \n\ntranscriptional response induced by copper nanoparticles was divergent from the \n\ninduced by the soluble copper, indicating that the effects are caused by the copper \n\nnanoparticles and not (only) due to their solubilization.  \n\n\n\n \n\n 65\n\nAt the moment, very little information is available about the effects of \n\nnanomaterials in terrestrial ecosystems (Johansen et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2008a; \n\nScott-Fordsmand et al. 2008a; Scott-Fordsmand et al. 2008b; Tong et al. 2007).  \n\nAmong soil species used in ecotoxicology are the Enchytraeids (Oligochaeta), \n\nimportant members of the soil fauna (Rombke and Moser 2002). They are \n\nabundant in many soils contributing to the improvement of the pore structure of the \n\nsoil and, indirectly, to the degradation of the organic matter (Amorim et al. 2005). \n\nEffect assessment is traditionally made at the individual level (ISO 2005), \n\nevaluating e.g. survival and reproduction. Recently, a cDNA microarray for E. \n\nalbidus, was developed and toxicogenomic studies are also possible (Amorim et \n\nal. 2009). DNA microarrays provide a powerful tool to analyze global responses of \n\nan organism to stressors present in the environment. Trough the quantification of \n\nthe expression of thousands of genes in a single experiment (Lettieri 2006; \n\nRockett and Dix 1999), we can identify cellular components that may be damaged \n\nand repaired during the stress exposure, as well as mechanisms involved in \n\ncellular responses. The measurement of these responses can serve as a \n\nsignal/marker for potential effects at population level.  \n\nTherefore, in the present study the main objective was to compare the effect of \n\ncopper salt versus nanosized copper, at the gene level in E. albidus. The test \n\nspecies was exposed to varying concentrations of copper and nanosized copper \n\nand its gene expression profile was analyzed through the cDNA microarray. \n\n \n \n2. Material and Methods \n \n2.1. Test organism \n \n\nThe test organism used belongs to the specie Enchytraeus albidus, Henle 1837. \n\nThe individuals were maintained in laboratory cultures under controlled conditions, \n\ne.g. photoperiod 16:8h light:dark and a temperature of 18\u00baC, details of culturing in \n\n(Rombke and Moser 2002). \n\nLaboratory cultures of the test species Enchytraeus albidus (Henle, 1837) were \n\nmaintained in moist soil (50% OECD soil, 50% natural garden soil), at 18\u00baC with a \n\n\n\n \n\n 66\n\nphotoperiod of 16:8h (light:dark), and fed once a week with finely ground and \n\nautoclaved rolled oats (Cimarrom, Portugal). Details of the culturing process are \n\ngiven in R\u00f6mbke and M\u00f6ser (2002). \n\n \n\n2.2. Test soil \n\nThe test system was based on homogenized and sterilized field collected soil from \n\nHygum, Denmark. The general physico-chemical characteristics of soil from the \n\nHygum-site are as follows: 20-32% coarse sand (>200\u00b5m), 20-25% fine sand (63-\n\n200\u00b5m), 11-20% coarse silt (20-63\u00b5m), 12-20% silt (20-20\u00b5m), 12-16% clay \n\n(<2\u00b5m) and 3.6-5.5% humus. The soil was sampled to a depth of 20 cm. To \n\nexclude soil animals already present, the soil was dried at 80\u00b0C for 24 h in an oven \n\n(Memmert, Type UL40, Braunschweig, Germany) and then sieved through a 2 mm \n\nmesh to remove larger particles. \n\n \n\n2.3. Chemical substances \n \n\nThe nanoparticles were made of Cu with a mean diameter of 80 nm, (PW-XRD \n\n<74 nm, DLS = 419\u00b11 nm, Zeta = 15.3\u00b10.3) and a purity of 99.5%. The \n\nnanoparticles were added to the soil following transfer to deionised water and \n\nultrasonic-steering for 15 min. The Cu-salt was obtained from CuCl2 solubilised in \n\nwater. The concentrations used 400, 600, 800 and 1000 mg/Kg of copper and \n\nnanosized copper. \n\n \n\n2.4. Experimental procedure \n\nAfter homogeneous mixing, sub-samples of the batch of soil were introduced into \n\nthe test vessels. Fifteen adult worms with well developed clitellum were introduced \n\nin each test vessel, each containing 25 g moist soil (40 to 60% of the maximum \n\nWHC). The vessel is covered with a lid (containing small holes) and the worms \n\nwere exposed for 48h at 20\u00baC and a 16:8h photoperiod. Four replicates per \n\ntreatment were used. At test end, animals were carefully removed, rinsed in \n\ndeionised water, stored in RNA later (Ambion) and frozen in liquid Nitrogen. \n\n\n\n \n\n 67\n\nSamples were stored at -80\u00baC till further analysis. Hybridization experiments, \n\ncontrol versus exposed, were always made in triplicate, using biological replicates.  \n\n \n2.5. RNA extraction  \n \nIsolation of total RNA from enchytraeids was performed through the Trizol \n\nextraction method (Invitrogen, Belgium). RNA extraction was followed by a DNAse \n\ntreatment (Fermentas Germany). The quantity and purity of the isolated RNA were \n\nmeasured spectrophotometrically with Nanodrop and its quality was checked on a \n\ndenaturing agarose gel. \n\n \n\n2.6. cDNA synthesis and Amminoallyl labeling  \n \n\nEqual quantities of RNA were pooled for all control and exposed organisms \n\nsamples. mRNA spike mix (lucidea controls) (GE Healthcare, Amersham) and \n\nrandom hexamer primers (Invitrogen) were added to the RNA. To convert RNA in \n\ncDNA, the amminoallyl-dNTPs mix (containing a 2:3 ratio of aminoallyl-dUTP \n\n(Invitrogen)) and 200U/\u00b5L Superscript II RT (Invitrogen) were incorporated. \n\nUnincorporated amminoallyl-dUTPs were removed using modified Qiagen PCR \n\nspin column protocol. Amminoallyl labeled cDNA was covalently bound to \n\nappropriate NSH-esters Cy Dyes (Amersham). Cy3 was coupled with control and \n\nCy5 with treatments. Uncoupled dyes were removed using the QIAquick PCR \n\npurification kit (Qiagen). The efficiency of labeling reaction was measured \n\nspectrophotometrically with a Nanodrop. Dye incorporation per sample of \n\napproximately 150pmol and a frequency of dye incorporation (FOI) less than 50 \n\nare near optimal for hybridization. \n\n \n\n2.7. Microarrays \n\nPreviously developed cDNA normalized library (Amorim et al. 2009) was spotted \n\nonto Generoma microarray slides (Asper Biotech, Estonia) and used in the present \n\nstudy. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 68\n\n2.8. Hybridization of microarrays \n \nBefore the hybridization, the arrays were incubated in pre-hybridization buffer, \n\nconsisting of 50% formamide, 5\u00d7SSC, 0,1% SDS and 0,1 BSA, at 42\u00baC for 60 \n\nminutes. After that, the arrays were washed by immersion in ultra pure water \n\nfollowed by immersion in isopropanol, and immediately dried with compressed N2. \n\nThe vacuum dried samples were resolved in hybridization solution consisting of \n\n50% formamide, 5\u00d7SSC, 0,1% SDS and 0,1 mg of Salmon sperm (SIGMA), a \n\nnucleic-acid blocker. The probe solution (that results of the combination of Cy3 \n\nand Cy5 labeling probes), incubated at 95\u00baC for 5 minutes, was applied on the \n\ncover-slides in the array. The array was placed in Genetix hybridization chamber \n\nwhere the hybridization was performed at 42\u00baC overnight. After the hybridization, \n\nthe arrays were immersed in four wash solutions containing decreasing \n\nconcentrations of SSC and SDS, finally the arrays were rinsed in MilliQ water and \n\nisopropanol for 1 minute and immediately dried in compressed N2. Three \n\nreplicates of each treatment were done, hybridizing each treatment versus the \n\ncontrol sample. \n\n \n2.9. Scanning and analysis of microarray data \n \nScanning was performed using an Agilent Microarray Scanner (Agilent \n\nTechnologies) at 532 and 635 nm for Cy3 and Cy5 respectively. The images \n\nacquired were assessed using Quant Array (Packard Biochip Technologies) for \n\nspot identification and for quantification of fluorescent signal intensities. \n\nSubsequently data were analyzed with limmaGUI package (based on limma \n\n(Smyth 2005)) in the R (2.8.0) software environment (http://www.R-project.org). \n\nThe fluorescent signal intensity for each DNA spot was calculated using \n\nbackground subtraction and saturated signal were excluded from further analysis. \n\nAfter that, a within and between array normalization was applied using global loess \n\n(Yang et al. 2002) and scale methods respectively. Quality control was done by \n\nmaking MA-plots and box plots of each array. Differential expression was \n\nassessed using linear models and Benjamini-Hochberg\u2019s (BH) method to correct \n\nfor multiple testing (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995) (adjusted p<0.05 was \n\nconsidered significant). Assessment of differential expression of genes was done \n\n\n\n \n\n 69\n\nfor each treatment separately, and resulted in a mean log2 expression ratio \n\n(treated/untreated) and a p-value for each probe on the array. All cDNA fragments \n\ncorrespondent to differentially expressed genes (adjusted p<0.05) were identified \n\nbased on their homology to sequences from the National Center for Biotechnology \n\nInformation (NCBI) database as determined by the Basic Local Alignment Search \n\nTool (BLAST). Both nucleotide\u2013nucleotide and nucleotide\u2013protein homology \n\nsearches were done to identify the isolated clones (BLASTN and BLASTX). \n\n \n\n2.10. Quantitative RT PCR \n \nTotal RNA (500ng) from the samples used for microarrays was converted into \n\ncDNA through a reverse transcription reaction using the SuperScript First-Strand \n\nSynthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Real time PCR was carried out on \n\n7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems), using Platinum SYBR Green \n\nqPCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen). Primer sets were designed for 5 target genes \n\nand one endogenous control gene (table 1) with the software Oligo Explorer\nTM\n\n \n\n(version 1.1.0). Determination of PCR efficiency and specificity was done by the \n\nobtaining standard and melting curves, respectively for all primer sets. cDNA was \n\ndiluted 1:4 and 2 \u00b5L was used in 20 \u00b5L PCR reaction volumes containing 2 \u00b5L of \n\nforward and 2 \u00b5L of reverse  primers (2 \u00b5M),  10 \u00b5L of Platinum SYBR Green \n\nqPCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen) and 4 \u00b5L of DEPC water. qPCR was performed \n\nin triplicate for each sample, on a 96-well optical plate (GeneAmp\u00ae, Applied \n\nBiosystems). Reaction conditions consisted of one initial cycle at 50\u00baC for 2 min, \n\nfollowed by one denaturation step at 95\u00baC for 2 min, 40 cycles at 95 \u00baC for 10 sec, \n\nand a dissociation step consisting of 15 sec at 95 \u00baC, 1 min at 60 \u00baC, and 15 sec at \n\n95 \u00baC. \n\nA mean normalized expression value was calculated from the obtained Ct values \n\nwith Relative Expression Software Tool (REST-MSC) using actin as a reference \n\ngene (housekeeping) for normalization of input cDNA. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 70\n\nTabela 1: RT-PCR primer sequences \n\nGene homolog 5\u2019 \u2013 3\u2019 Forward primer 5\u2019 \u2013 3\u2019 Reverse primer \n\nSuperoxide \ndismutase (SOD) \n\nGCGGAAGTGGAAATGGAAG CGACATGGGGACTGAAGTG \n\nCalcium dependent \nprotein kinase  \n\nAAAGGGTCGGCAGAATTGG AAGGCGCGGAACTCTATCC \n\nCitocrome c CGGAAGGTGATGCTGAGAAG CGTCTCCTTCGTCCATTTG \n\nHeat Shock Protein \n8 (HSPA8) \n\nTGTTCAGGTTCTTTAACC GTTTTCTTTTATTGCACC \n\nTranscription factor AGCTTTCTCAAATCATCAAA AGACTTCACCAACCTATTGCG \n\nActine CAGGGAAAAGATGACCCAAA AGGGCGTAACCCTCGTAGAT \n\n \n\n \n\n3. Results and Discussion \n \nUsing linear models and empirical Bayes methods (Smyth 2005), a total of 127 in \n\n480 gene fragments were identified as differently expressed (BH adjusted p<0.05). \n\nCu salt treatment caused 68, 32, 10 and 4 significant transcripts and Cu \n\nnanoparticles 26, 2, 39 and 1, for the concentrations 400, 600, 800 and 1000 \n\nmg/Kg respectively. No additional fold-change cut-off was used to identify \n\ndifferently expressed genes because, as stated in Nota (Nota et al. 2008), slight \n\nchanges in gene expression could also result in major physiological effects.

RPA3 is the smallest subunit of \n\nReplication Protein A (RPA) and is believed to have a structural role in the \n\nassembly of RPA heterotrimer. RPA is a nuclear ssDNA binding protein which \n\nappears to be involved in all aspects of DNA metabolism including replication, \n\nrecombination, and repair. A reduction in the amount of RPA could be indicative of \n\nDNA damage, since the recruitment of RPA to DNA damaged sites may contribute \n\nto its down-regulation (Wang et al. 1999). Poly ADP-ribose polymerase member \n\n14 (PARP14) is a multifunctional protein implicated in many cellular functions. \n\nPARP proteins are important components in the cellular responses to various \n\nkinds of insults to genomic DNA, including oxidative DNA damage, telomere \n\nerosion, or improper segregation of chromosomes, thus its down-regulation could \n\ncause severe damage to E. albidus. Elongation factor-1alpha (EF-1?) is an actin \n\nbinding protein involved in the shuttling of aa-tRNA. It was also found down-\n\nregulated in fathead minnow larvae when exposed to copper (Lewis and Keller \n\n2009) and in recent investigations, its down-regulation has been related with cell \n\ndeath (Byun et al. 2009; Kobayashi and Yonehara 2009) A gene coding for a \n\nribosomal protein (ribosomal protein L7A) was found down-regulated by the \n\ntreatments Cu e Cu-NP 400 and up-regulated by Cu 600.   \n\nEnergy metabolism was also affected by copper-salt and nano-copper. Short-\n\nchain dehydrogenase and adipokinetic hormone akh2 where found down-\n\nregulated while NADH dehydrogenase Fe-S protein 4 and cytochrome c were up-\n\nregulated (tab 2). ATP synthase e chain was found up-regulated and down-\n\nregulated by different treatments (tab 2). The disruption of genes associated with \n\nmitochondrial electron transport and consequent dysfunction due to copper \n\n\n\n \n\n 74\n\nexposure has already been reported in the earthworm Lumbricus rubellus (Bundy \n\net al. 2008). However, our data show the up-regulation of genes coding for NADH \n\ndehydrogenase Fe-S protein 4, ATP synthase e chain and cytochrome c \n\n(mitochondrial proteins). On the other hand, the up-regulation of monosaccharide-\n\ntransporting ATPase (in the treatments Cu-NP 400 and 800) is in accordance with \n\nBundy\u2019s results (Bundy et al. 2008), which suggests a switch to metabolism of \n\nstored carbohydrates after copper exposure. \n\nIn the group of transcripts involved in protein metabolism, there are down-\n\nregulated genes (serine-threonine kinase; calmodulin-domain protein kinase; and \n\ncalcium-dependent protein kinase) and up-regulated genes (peptidoglycan \n\nrecognition protein sc2, arginine and chaperonin subunit 8). Protein kinases play a \n\nrole in a multitude of cellular processes, including division, proliferation, apoptosis \n\nand differentiation, which could be affected by the down-regulation of these three \n\nkinases. Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are involved in innate \n\nimmunity. They are pattern recognition receptors that bind, and in certain cases, \n\nhydrolyze peptidoglycans (PGNs) of bacterial cell walls. The immune response of \n\nE. albidus can be compromised in the treatment Cu 400 due to the down-\n\nregulation of the gene encoding for manose C type 1-like.This is a type I \n\nmembrane receptor protein highly related to the mannose receptor C type 1 \n\nprotein (MRC1) which mediates the endocytosis of glycoproteins by macrophages \n\nand acts as phagocytic receptor for bacteria, fungi and other pathogens.  \n\nBoth chaperonins and heat shock proteins are involved in assisting the folding of \n\nproteins into their functional state, and genes coding for these proteins where \n\nfound up-(tab 2). The gene HSPA8 encodes a heat shock cognate protein (that \n\nbelongs to the heat shock protein 70 family) which binds to nascent polypeptides \n\nto facilitate correct folding. The up-regulation of transcripts encoding a heat shock \n\nprotein (HSPA8), has already been observed in response to metals (Nota et al. \n\n2008). As suggested to cadmium (Nota et al. 2008), copper ions probably disturb \n\nthe normal folding of proteins or cause indirect damage to proteins, e.g. trough the \n\ngeneration of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Although copper is known to cause \n\noxidative damage through the formation of hydroxyl radicals via the Haber-Weiss \n\n\n\n \n\n 75\n\nreaction (Bremner 1998), the transcript encoding superoxide dismutase (SOD), an \n\nenzyme involved in antioxidant defence, was found down-regulated (tab. 2).   \n\n \n\n400 600 800 1000\n\nSOD\n\n400 600 800 1000\n\nconcentrations (mg/Kg)\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0.5\n\n1\nlo\n\ng\n 2\n\n r\na\nti\no\n\nCu_microarray\n\nCu_PCR\nNp_microarray\n\nNP_PCR\n\nCaDPK\n\n400 600 800 1000400 600 800 1000\nconcentrations (mg/Kg)\n\n3.5\n3\n\n2.5\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n\n0.5\n\nlo\ng\n 2\n\n r\na\nti\no\n\n400 600 800 1000\n\ncitC\n\n400 600 800 1000\nconcentrations (mg/Kg)\n\n1.5\n1\n\n0.5\n0\n\n0.5\n1\n\n1.5\n2\n\n2.5\n\nlo\ng\n 2\n\n r\na\nti\no\n\n400 600 800 1000\n\nTransFact\n\n400 600 800 1000\nconcentrations (mg/Kg)\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\nlo\ng\n 2\n\n r\na\nti\no\n\n400 600 800 1000\n\nHSP8\n\n400 600 800 1000\nconcentrations (mg/Kg)\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nlo\ng\n 2\n\n r\na\nti\no\n\n400 600 800 1000\n\nSOD\n\n400 600 800 1000\n\nconcentrations (mg/Kg)\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0.5\n\n1\nlo\n\ng\n 2\n\n r\na\nti\no\n\n400 600 800 1000\n\nSOD\n\n400 600 800 1000\n\nconcentrations (mg/Kg)\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0.5\n\n1\nlo\n\ng\n 2\n\n r\na\nti\no\n\nCu_microarray\n\nCu_PCR\nNp_microarray\n\nNP_PCR\n\nCu_microarray\n\nCu_PCR\nNp_microarray\n\nNP_PCR\n\nCaDPK\n\n400 600 800 1000400 600 800 1000\nconcentrations (mg/Kg)\n\n3.5\n3\n\n2.5\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n\n0.5\n\nlo\ng\n 2\n\n r\na\nti\no\n\nCaDPK\n\n400 600 800 1000400 600 800 1000\nconcentrations (mg/Kg)\n\n3.5\n3\n\n2.5\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n\n0.5\n\nlo\ng\n 2\n\n r\na\nti\no\n\n3.5\n3\n\n2.5\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n\n0.5\n\nlo\ng\n 2\n\n r\na\nti\no\n\n400 600 800 1000\n\ncitC\n\n400 600 800 1000\nconcentrations (mg/Kg)\n\n1.5\n1\n\n0.5\n0\n\n0.5\n1\n\n1.5\n2\n\n2.5\n\nlo\ng\n 2\n\n r\na\nti\no\n\n400 600 800 1000\n\ncitC\n\n400 600 800 1000\nconcentrations (mg/Kg)\n\n1.5\n1\n\n0.5\n0\n\n0.5\n1\n\n1.5\n2\n\n2.5\n\nlo\ng\n 2\n\n r\na\nti\no\n\n1.5\n1\n\n0.5\n0\n\n0.5\n1\n\n1.5\n2\n\n2.5\n\nlo\ng\n 2\n\n r\na\nti\no\n\n400 600 800 1000\n\nTransFact\n\n400 600 800 1000\nconcentrations (mg/Kg)\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\nlo\ng\n 2\n\n r\na\nti\no\n\n400 600 800 1000\n\nTransFact\n\n400 600 800 1000\nconcentrations (mg/Kg)\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\nlo\ng\n 2\n\n r\na\nti\no\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\nlo\ng\n 2\n\n r\na\nti\no\n\n400 600 800 1000\n\nHSP8\n\n400 600 800 1000\nconcentrations (mg/Kg)\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nlo\ng\n 2\n\n r\na\nti\no\n\n400 600 800 1000\n\nHSP8\n\n400 600 800 1000\nconcentrations (mg/Kg)\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nlo\ng\n 2\n\n r\na\nti\no\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nlo\ng\n 2\n\n r\na\nti\no\n\n \nFigure 3: Gene expression changes observed in microarray and RT-PCR for superoxide \n\ndismutase (SOD), calcium dependent protein kinase (CaDPK), cytochrome c (citC), \n\ntranscription factor (TransFact) and heat shock protein 8 (HSP8). Results are expressed \n\nby means of log2 ratio exposed/control.  \n\n \n\nIn Fig. 3, results from the RT-PCR analysis are shown. Except for SOD, in the \n\ntreatment Cu 400, which showed to be, up-regulated in the RT-PCR, the \n\nexpression of all genes in the microarray (tab 2) was confirmed in the RT-PCR. \n\n It was confirmed that there was no concentration dependent response in any of \n\nthe tested genes, which was in agreement with the microarray data (tab 2). For Cu \n\n(copper-salt) treatments, in general genes show the highest expression value at \n\n400mg/Kg and the lowest expression at 800 mg/Kg. In NP (nano-copper) \n\ntreatments, the higher down-regulation (lowest expression value) was always \n\n\n\n \n\n 76\n\nobserved in 1000 mg/Kg, which suggest that the higher concentration of copper \n\nnanoparticles caused higher effects in gene expression of E. albidus. \n\nBased on differently expressed genes (BH adjusted p<0,05), a cluster analysis \n\n(Pearson\u2019s Uncentered) was performed to both genes and treatments. The cluster \n\nanalysis of genes did not cluster according to function (GO homology), suggesting \n\nthat either form of copper affected the same functions. However this information is \n\npoorly supported at the moment due to the fact that it is not know in which \n\nprocesses the \u201cunknown\u201d genes are involved.  \n\nThe cluster between treatments is shown in figure 4. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4: Hierarchical cluster of samples (Perarson\u2019s uncentered), based on \ndifferently expressed genes (BH adjusted p<0.05). \n \nNo separation between treatments (Cu-salt or nano-Cu) is observed based on the \n\ncluster analysis. However, there is a trend to cluster by concentration range: the \n\ntwo smaller (400 and 600 mg/Kg, with the exception of Cu 600) and the two higher \n\n(800 and 1000 mg/Kg) concentrations are clustered separately. \n\n4. Conclusions \n \n\nDNA microarray analysis was an important tool in analysing effects, showing that \n\nthere was differential gene expression in response to the different treatments. \n\nAdditionally, transcriptional response induced by copper nanoparticles was \n\ndifferent from those induced by the copper-salt. At the moment, in part due to the \n\nfact that E. albidus is a non-model organism and that the function of the great part \n\nof the genes is unknown, the discrimination between copper nanoparticles and \n\ncopper-salt was not possible, neither the unravelling of the underlying mechanisms \n\nof toxicity.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 77\n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThe authors acknowledge all the support provided by Patricia Pereira during the \n\nRT-PCR analysis.  \n\n \n5.

The purpose was to \n\ncompare the responses in Enchytraeus albidus of the two copper forms: copper-\n\nsalt (CuCl2) and copper nanoparticles. Results show that both tools were adequate \n\nto assess effects, revealing oxidative stress and differently expressed genes \n\nalthough, not able to fully discriminate and interpret effects.  \n\nThe battery of biomarkers analysed in this study was chosen to have a broad \n\nrange of enzymes: being the first time nanomaterials are studied in E. albidus we \n\nwished to obtain the general response of the organism. A clear separation \n\nbetween the two treatments was observed, which could indicate that the effects \n\ncaused by nano-copper are not only due to the solubility. A time and concentration \n\ndependent response was also inferred. However, it was not possible to choose \n\none or a group of biomarkers which could characterize the response. \n\nNevertheless, glutathione-peroxidase and non-enzymatic glutathiones (reduced \n\nglutathione, oxidised glutathione) seemed to act as the main anti-oxidant defence \n\nagainst stress induced by copper (salt and nano form) at 4 days of exposure, even \n\nif cellular damage was occurring after 8 days, observed by the increased levels of \n\nlipid peroxidation. To discriminate between copper-salt and copper nanoparticles, \n\na broader range of concentrations should be tested. \n\nAt the gene expression level, in general, the biological functions affected were \n\ntranscription and translation, protein metabolism, energy metabolism, immune and \n\nstress response, carbohydrate and fat metabolism, development, signal \n\ntransduction and cell structure and cytoskeletal organization, all involving key \n\nfunctions that can lead to effects at higher levels of biological organization. In \n\ngeneral, copper-salt caused a higher number of differently expressed transcripts. \n\nThe proportion of genes in each category was different between the copper forms, \n\nhowever conclusions cannot be drawn based on these results, due to a large \n\npercentage of \u201cunknown\u201d gene functions. The fact that E. albidus is a non-model \n\n\n\n \n\n 84\n\norganism (attending their use in molecular techniques since its genome has not \n\nbeen sequenced, and not according to the ecotoxicological point of view where it \n\nis, in fact, a model organism) and thus the analysis of the results is restricted by \n\nthe homology of DNA fragments in other organisms, is a limiting factor in the \n\ninterpretation of the results obtained.  \n\nFurther research is needed to link these effects with higher levels of biological \n\norganization, to allow the integration of effects at population, sub-cellular and \n\nmolecular levels. More metal-based nanomaterials could be studied, using these \n\nparameters, to determine if the response is related to copper nanoparticles and, if \n\nso, to establish a group of biomarkers suitable to characterize this response.  \n\nThis study represents an important contribution on the field of ecotoxicology of \n\nnanomaterials to soil ecosystems/organisms."}]}}}
