Em \n\noncologia, a PDT leva \u00e0 indu\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies reativas de oxig\u00e9nio (reactive oxygen species, \n\nROS) no tecido tumoral, no qual ocorreu previamente o uptake preferencial e/ou a reten\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde um FS. \n\n  As ftalocianinas t\u00eam-se vindo a revelar FSs promissores na PDT devido \u00e0s suas \n\npropriedades foto-f\u00edsicas. Contudo, estes compostos para al\u00e9m de pouco sol\u00faveis em \u00e1gua, \n\nt\u00eam problemas de agrega\u00e7\u00e3o e de especificidade para os tecidos tumorais. Assim, o trabalho \n\napresentado nesta tese teve como objetivo principal conjugar co-axialmente ftalocianinas \n\nde sil\u00edcio (silicon phthalocyanines, SiPcs) com duas mol\u00e9culas de galactose (SiPcGal2) e \n\ncom duas unidades dendr\u00edticas de galactose (SiPcGal4) para que estes FSs fossem \n\nreconhecidos por galectinas (e.g. galectina-1) sobrexpressas em c\u00e9lulas tumorais. Contudo, \n\nos compostos desejados finais n\u00e3o foram obtidos, uma vez que a remo\u00e7\u00e3o dos grupos \n\nisopropilideno, protetores dos grupos hidroxilo das unidades de galactose, n\u00e3o foi \n\nconseguida. Assim, foram avaliadas as propriedades foto-f\u00edsicas e foto-qu\u00edmicas das SiPcs \n\ncom as galactoses protegidas, comparando com a SiPc dihidr\u00f3xido (SiPc(OH)2), de forma \n\na estudar a influ\u00eancia da conjuga\u00e7\u00e3o co-axial de biomol\u00e9culas no core destes tipo de FSs. \n\nInfelizmente, a solubilidade das SiPcs em solventes aquosos n\u00e3o foi conseguida, contudo o \n\nseu espectro de absor\u00e7\u00e3o UV-vis\u00edvel evidenciou elevada absor\u00e7\u00e3o a altos comprimentos de \n\nonda (650-700 nm), janela espectrofotom\u00e9trica onde ocorre uma penetra\u00e7\u00e3o mais profunda \n\nda luz nos tecidos. Para al\u00e9m disso, estes FSs demonstraram-se excelentes marcadores \n\nfluorescentes, est\u00e1veis ap\u00f3s irradia\u00e7\u00e3o e bons geradores de 1O2. Foram ainda realizados \n\nestudos in vitro com o objetivo de validar o seu potencial fotodin\u00e2mico no tratamento do \n\ncancro da bexiga, sendo que a SiPcGal4 e a SiPcGal2 agregaram nas c\u00e9lulas, tendo assim \n\num baixo uptake, baixa toxicidade ap\u00f3s foto-ativa\u00e7\u00e3o e baixa produ\u00e7\u00e3o de ROS.  \n\n  No geral, as SiPcs demonstraram um grande potencial como futuros FSs para a PDT, dado \n\nas suas excelentes propriedades foto-f\u00edsicas, o que nos incentiva na descoberta de novas \n\nt\u00e9cnicas que diminuam a sua agrega\u00e7\u00e3o nas c\u00e9lulas, como a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de bio-formula\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nest\u00e1veis e a desprote\u00e7\u00e3o das mol\u00e9culas de galactose, que tamb\u00e9m ir\u00e1 aumentar a sua \n\nespecificidade para c\u00e9lulas tumorais. \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKeywords Photodynamic Therapy, Bladder Cancer, Silicon Phthalocyanine, Galectins, Galacto-\n\ndendritic units \n\n \n \nAbstract Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) relies on the combination of a photosensitizer (PS), light and \n\nmolecular oxygen (O2) to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can trigger cell \n\ndeath pathways. In oncology, the PS needs to be preferentially accumulated in cancer cells \n\nand a good generator of ROS (especially singlet oxygen, 1O2).  \n\nPhthalocyanines (Pcs) are promising PSs in PDT due to their photochemical and \n\nphotophysical properties. However, Pcs present solubility and aggregation problems, as well \n\nas low selectivity to the cancer tissue. Therefore, it will be conjugated a silicon \n\nphthalocyanine (SiPc) with two galactose molecules (SiPcGal2) and another with two \n\ngalacto-dendritic units (SiPcGal4), both in axial positions. The aim of that conjugation is to \n\npromote the binding of the PS with galactose-binding proteins such as galectins (e.g. \n\ngalectin-1) which are found to be overexpressed in cancer cells. Nevertheless, the desired \n\ncompound were not obtained, once the hydrolysis of the isopropylidene galactose-protective \n\ngroups didn\u2019t work. Thereby, the photophysical and photochemical properties of those two \n\nSiPcs with the galactose-protective groups were studied in comparison with the SiPc \n\ndihydroxide (SiPc(OH)2), in order to study the SiPc core properties as well as the influence \n\nof an axial conjugation of biomolecules. The PSs solubility was compromised in an aqueous \n\nsolution, however their absorption UV-Visible spectra showed high absorption peaks at a \n\nhigh wavelengths range (650\u2013700 nm), which is the ideal therapeutical window where there \n\nis a higher penetration of light into the tissues. Furthermore, these SiPcs demonstrated to be \n\ngood fluorescence labels, photostable and good 1O2 generators. In vitro studies were \n\nperformed with the aim of validating them as photodynamic therapeutic agents against \n\nbladder cancer cells, however SiPcGal4 and SiPcGal2 aggregated on cells, having a low \n\nuptake, phototoxicity and ROS production. \n\nOverall, SiPcs have demonstrated a great potential as future PSs for PDT, thanks to their \n\nexcellent photophysical properties, which prompt us in the discovery of different approaches \n\nthat diminished their aggregation on cells, such as the incorporation of PSs into bio-stable \n\nformulations and the deprotection of the galactose molecules, which will also increase their \n\nspecificity to tumoral cells. \n\n \n\n\n\nviii \n\n \n\nContents \n\n \n\nResumo  ................................................................................................................. vi \n\nAbstract  ................................................................................................................ vii \n\nAbbreviations and acronyms ................................................................................. xii \n\n \n\nCHAPTER I - Introduction .................................................................................... 1 \n\n1.

Overview \n  \n\nCancer is a disease caused by an abnormal growth of cells which tend to \n\nproliferate in an uncontrolled way and, in some cases, to spread out to other organs \n\nof the body through the blood and lymph systems. This process is named metastasis \n\nand corresponds to the most advanced stage of cancer and the most common \n\ncause of cancer death. There are more than 100 different types of cancer. In 2012, \n\nthere were approximately 14 million of new cancer cases and 8.2 million of cancer \n\nrelated deaths (1). The most common and conventional cancer treatments are \n\nsurgery, and/or radiotherapy, and/or chemotherapy. However, there are serious \n\nside effects in those treatments, such as loss of normal cell function. In order to \n\ncounter that, less invasive approaches were developed over the years, targeted \n\ntherapies that use drugs to more precisely identify and destroy cancer cells, causing \n\nfar less damage to healthy cells. Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) is a newer type of \n\ntherapeutic approach that uses special drugs named photosensitizing agents, along \n\nwith light to induce cancer cell death, through the production of reactive oxygen \n\nspecies (ROS). PDT can be applied alone or in combination with the aforementioned \n\ntraditional treatments (2,3). \n\nThe pursuit of new photosensitizing agents for PDT is a lively research field. \n\nThose drugs should specifically accumulate in cancer tissues and have high \n\nproduction of ROS. The conjugation of galactose targeting moieties with a \n\nporphyrinoid-based drug is a valuable way to achieve a high local concentration of \n\nthat drug in tumor tissues, since certain galectins (i.e. galectin-1 and galectin-3) are \n\noverexpressed on the target cells relatively to normal tissues (4).  \n\n  \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\n2. Photodynamic therapy \n \n\nIn oncology, PDT is an emerging treatment modality able to treat many forms \n\nof cancer and other non-neoplastic diseases (5-7), being particularly interesting in \n\nthe tumors that occur in cavities (such as bladder, esophagus or intestine). This \n\nmethodology combines a photosensitizer (PS) with light of appropriate wavelength \n\nand molecular oxygen (O2). None of these elements are toxic by themselves, \n\nhowever when combined they generate ROS that kill malignant cells by triggering a \n\ncascade of cytotoxic reactions (8). In order to allow that the knowledge of \n\nphotosensitization can be rapidly applied in clinical practice, PDT requires the \n\ncooperation of chemists (e.g., for synthesis of new PS), biologists (e.g., for testing \n\nnew substances), physicists (e.g., for light dosimetry), and clinicians (e.g., for the \n\ntransfer from the lab bench to the clinical application). \n\n \n\n2.1 Brief History \n\n \n\nThe first clinical use of PDT date back to 1903 when Tappeiner and Jesionek \n\ncombined a topical application of eosin with white light to treat skin tumors, lupus \n\nand condylomata of female genitalia (9). After ten years, Meyer-Betz found out that \n\nporphyrins (Pors) act as photosensitizing agents in humans while injecting 200 mg \n\nof hematoporphyrin (Hp) in himself. (10). However, after sun light exposure there \n\nwere side effects, such as severe pain and swelling confined to the light-exposed \n\nareas. Around the 1960\u2019s, Schwartz and Lipson described the tumor accumulation \n\nof Hp derivatives (HpD, a mixture of monomers, dimers and oligomers) as well as \n\ntheir use in tumors photodetection (11). Since these pioneering works, several \n\ncompounds have been developed and tested. Among them, there is Photofrin\u00ae, the \n\nfirst PS approved for clinical PDT in the treatment of superficial bladder cancer in \n\nCanada and early lung and advanced esophageal cancers in The Netherlands and \n\nJapan (12). Considering the ideal properties of a PS, that will be explained further \n\non detail, a wide range of synthetic or natural PSs have been studied, tested in vivo \n\nand in vitro, and some of them are currently in advanced stages of clinical trials. \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nExamples of new PSs are synthetic Pors (13), benzoporphyrins (14), chlorins (15), \n\nphthalocyanines (Pcs) (16), among others. \n\n \n\n2.2 Molecular basis of PDT \n\n \n\nPhotophysics \n\n \n\nPDT is based on the PS administration and after a preferential uptake and/or \n\nretention period the affected area is irradiated with light to induce photoreactions. \n\nUpon illumination with light of an appropriate wavelength, PS absorbs a photon \n\nleading to the formation of an electronically excited singlet state (1PS*). However, \n\nthis short-lived species can lose their energy and restore the ground state by \n\nemission of fluorescence or by internal conversion (IC, non-radiative transitions \n\nbetween two electronic states with the same spin multiplicity) with energy loss as \n\nheat. The singlet state 1PS*, can also undergo the process known as intersystem \n\ncrossing (ISC), leading to formation of the long-lived triplet excited state (3PS*). The \n\nenergy of 3PS* can be dissipated (leading the PS to its ground state) through two \n\nmain pathways: i) thermal decay, i.e. IC; or ii) by emission of light, namely \n\nphosphorescence (P). In Figure 1.1 it is represented a modified Jablonski diagram \n\nthat illustrates the electronic states of the PS and the transitions between them. 3PS* \n\nusually has a lifetime in the microsecond range (typically > 0.5 \u00b5s), which is sufficient \n\nto enable interaction between the excited PS and surrounding biomolecules. \n\nMoreover, this state can induce cytotoxic effects by PDT through two kinds of \n\nreactions, defined as Type I and Type II photoreactions (17). \n\n \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_state\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 Modified Jablonsky energy diagram showing the various modes of excitation \n\nand relaxation occurring in PSs: excitation (E), internal conversion (IC), fluorescence (F), \n\nphosphorescence (P), intersystem crossing (ISC). Type I and Type II photoreactions are \n\nalso represented. \n\n \n\n \n\nPhotochemistry \n\n \n\nType I photoreactions can proceed by an electron (and/or proton) transfer \n\nprocess, hence causing a direct interaction of 3PS* with the cellular substrate (lipids, \n\nproteins, nucleic acids, etc.) leading to generation of radicals. Subsequent reaction \n\nwith O2 forms ROS, such as the superoxide anion (O2\u00b7?), the hydroxyl radical (OH\u00b7), \n\nand hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) that initiate radical chain reactions (18,19).  \n\nAlternatively, Type II photoreactions proceed by energy transfer, where the \n\ninteraction of O2 in its ground triplet state (3O2) with 3PS* generates a more reactive \n\nform of oxygen, i.e. singlet oxygen (1O2). This non-radical species are highly reactive \n\ntowards electrons rich substrates such as for instance, double bonds, aromatic \n\nrings, amines and thioethers (18,19). They also react with plasmatic membrane \n\nbiomolecules and different cellular organelles, leading to the selective destruction \n\nof the target cells by necrosis and/or apoptosis and/or autophagy-associated cell \n\ndeath, without damaging the healthy tissue (Figure 1.1). Antitumor effects of PDT \n\nderive from three inter-related mechanisms: direct cytotoxic effects on tumor cells, \n\ndamage to the tumor vasculature and induction of a robust inflammatory reaction \n\nthat can lead to the development of systemic immunity (3). The role of 1O2 in the \n\nphotodynamic effect is controversial between researchers. However, for most PSs \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\ncurrently under investigation, the 1O2-mediated photodynamic mechanism is the \n\nmodel of cytotoxic action usually accepted (20). To investigate the chemistry of 1O2, \n\nseveral analytical tools can be used such as spectrophotometry, fluorimetry, and \n\nchemiluminometry. In spectrophotometry, 1O2 react rapidly and irreversibly with a \n\nprobe (e.g. diphenylisobenzofuran, DPBF) to initially yield an endoperoxide which, \n\nin turn, emerge into other products that do not fluoresce and have absorption \n\nspectra different from that of the probe (21). The use of selective and photo-\n\nactivated PS makes PDT a promising technique for the treatment of a variety of \n\noncological diseases. \n\n \n\n3. Photosensitizers \n\n \n\nA PS, which is a molecule that enters an excited state when exposed to light \n\nof a specific wavelength, can use that energy to induce cytotoxic reactions leading \n\nto cell death and tissue destruction. Thus, a good PS agent with potentially optimal \n\nproperties for PDT should be endowed with specific features: i) single pure \n\ncompound; ii) low manufacturing costs and good stability in storage; iii) no dark \n\ntoxicity, but being toxic upon photo-activation; iv) rapid clearance from normal \n\ntissues to minimize phototoxic side effects; v) high triplet-state quantum yields, i.e., \n\ntriplet-state with lifetimes enough and sufficiently energetic to produce 1O2 and vi) \n\nhigh absorption peak between 600 and 800 nm (therapeutic window). This last \n\ncharacteristic is related to the aforementioned light penetration into the tissues once \n\nin this range the light wavelengths are still energetic enough to produce 1O2 and \n\ntissues are more transparent, thus light has its maximum depth of penetration \n\n(Figure 1.2). Absorption bands at shorter wavelengths than 600 nm have less tissue \n\npenetration due to the endogenous absorption by tissue cromophores (e.g. oxy-\n\n/deoxy- hemoglobin, melanin), leading to skin photosensitivity. At wavelengths \n\nhigher than 800 nm there is not enough energy for the 3PS* transfer to the ground \n\nstate of O2 in order to excite it to the singlet state (20). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2. Propagation of light through the tissues. Adapted from (3). \n\n \n\nAlthough many PSs, such as methylene blue (3,7-bis(dimethylamino)-\n\nphenothiazin-5-ium chloride, MB), rose bengal (4,5,6,7-tetrachloro-2',4',5',7'-\n\ntetraiodofluorescein) and acridine (2,3-benzoquinoline) are known to be efficient 1O2 \n\ngenerators, the vast majority that are successful as PDT agents are based upon the \n\ntetrapyrrole chromophore (22). Tetrapyrroles usually have a large absorption band \n\nin the region of 400 nm known as the Soret band, and a set of absorption bands as \n\nthe spectrum gets closer to red wavelengths \u2013 known as Q bands (23). \n\nThe evaluation of physicochemical properties of a new PS can be performed \n\nby spectroscopic techniques and in vitro studies can be used to highlight specific \n\napplications. Additionally, it is important to screen the absorption, distribution, \n\nmetabolism and excretion (ADME) properties in order to avoid the clinical failure of \n\ndrug candidates. According to a survey by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in \n\n1991, approximately 40 % of clinical failure was due to poor pharmacokinetics (PK) \n\nproperties (24). Then, pharmaceutical companies began assessing those properties \n\nof new chemical entities at the very early stages of drug discovery (25). Several \n\ntechniques can be used for this screening, such as in vitro optimization to \n\nunderstand the specific factors that contribute to the drug disposition, and in vivo \n\nmethods that provide more integrated means for optimizing ADME properties (26). \n\n300nm 400nm 500nm 600nm \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nStarting with the administration, there are three possible routes: enteral route \n\n(oral, where the effect is systemic and the substance is given via the digestive tract), \n\nparenteral route (the effect is also systemic but the substance is given by routes \n\nother than the digestive tract) and topical (the substance is applied directly where \n\nits action is desired and the effect is local). Parenteral administration routes include \n\nseveral injections types: intravenous (IV), subcutaneous (SC), intradermal and \n\nintramuscular (IM). Many factors affect the drug distribution (i.e. its transport from \n\nthe point of administration or absorption to the site of action), such as the vascular \n\npermeability, regional blood flow, cardiac output, perfusion rate of the tissue and the \n\nbinding ability of the drug to plasma proteins. The lipophilic drug properties that are \n\ndesirable to its uptake into the biological membranes of its effector site are \n\nprejudicial to its elimination of the body. That is why it needs to be metabolized into \n\nmore hydrophilic metabolites that will be able to pass the renal tubes without being \n\nreabsorbed. This metabolic process occurs mainly in the liver, but also in the blood, \n\nbrain, lung and kidneys. After that, the drug is excreted (renal or biliary; minor: \n\nexhalation, sweat) and eliminated from the body (27). Figure 1.3 resumes the drug \n\nroute from its administration into the body till its excretion. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.3. Drug ADME route in the human body. Adapted from (28). \n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nFirst and second generations PSs \n\n \n\nThe first family of PSs is represented by a purified version of HpD, named \n\nPhotofrin\u00ae (Figure 1.4) (29). This was the first PS approved for the treatment of \n\nearly-stage and advanced lung cancers, superficial gastric cancer, esophageal \n\nadenocarcinoma, cervical cancer and bladder cancer (BC), in 1993, in Canada. This \n\nPS has an absorption spectrum characteristic of Pors with five peaks (one stronger \n\nband \u2013 Soret band \u2013 and four Q bands). However, Photofrin\u00ae is not a pure \n\ncompound and shows low specificity for the cancer tissue leading to cytotoxic \n\ndamage in the healthy one like an intense inflammatory and necrotic reaction at the \n\ntreated site (23). Additionally, it has a low maximum wave absorption band (630 \n\nnm), which only allows biological effects at a tissue depth of around 5 mm, after \n\nirradiation. Moreover, these sensitizers take 2-3 months to clear from the cutaneous \n\ntissues which requires that during this period of time the patients are required to \n\navoid bright light (30). \n\n \n\nFigure 1.4. Photofrin\u00ae structure. \n\n \n\nThe second generation PSs include, among others, Por derivatives, chlorins \n\nand Pcs (e.g. Levulan\u00ae, Foscan\u00ae and silicon(IV) phthalocyanine (Pc4)). They have \n\nhigh ROS production and strong absorption in the required wavelength range (600-\n\n850 nm), which allows phototherapy in deep regions, leading to a better efficacy of \n\nPDT. Kennedy et al demonstrated the clinical suitability of ?-aminolevulinic acid \n\n(ALA) (31). Bladder tissue can be photosensitized by instillation of ALA, a prodrug \n\nthat is able to initiate a series of biochemical reactions that result in significant \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\naccumulation of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) or photoactive porphyrins (PAPs) that \n\npreferentially accumulate in malignant and pre-cancerous tissue rather than in \n\nbenign cells. However, ALA is an hydrophilic compound and cannot therefore \n\npenetrate all tissue, resulting in some clinical limitations, such as a long swelling \n\ntime and a variable PpIX fluorescence intensity and distribution (32). Chlorins are \n\ntetrapyrroles with one pyrrole ring reduced. This feature leads to a higher \n\nwavelength absorption band in the region of 650-690 nm which is desirable for PDT \n\n(15). Pcs are Por synthetic analogues with excellent photophysical and chemical \n\nproperties, that together with their chemical versatility, make this class of \n\ncompounds promising candidates for PDT applications (30). Some of the first and \n\nsecond generation PSs that already are under clinical trial or in clinical use are \n\nsummarized in Table 1.1. \n\n \n\nTable 1.1 PSs under clinical trial and in clinical use for malignant diseases. \n\nPS \nChemical \n\nclass \nName Indications \n\nDate of \napproval \n\nand country \n\nHpD Por Photofrin\u00ae \n\nBarrett\u2019s esophagus, \nbladder, lung, cervical, \nprostate and gastric \ncancers \n\n1993 in \nCanada.

Pors and their \n\nderivatives have been conjugated with many proteins, such as human and bovine \n\nserum albumin (HSA and BSA, respectively) (33), monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) \n\n(34) and amino acids (35), among others. Alternatively, carbohydrates, that are able \n\nto target carbohydrate binding proteins overexpressed in tumoral cells, are also \n\nbeing explored as potential targeting components (36). \n\nIn our research group, at the University of Aveiro, several Por \n\nglycoconjugates have been developed with very promising results for BC treatment \n\nand for antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2, after PDT (37-\n\n40). The glycoconjugates have demonstrated promising in vitro results and are \n\ncurrently being tested in vivo.

Phthalocyanines \n \n\nPcs have been widely studied due to their potentiality to be used in medicine \n\nand supramolecular chemistry (46). In this section their structural and photophysical \n\nproperties, the synthetic strategies and their role as PS agents will be highlighted. \n\n \n\nStructure and properties \n\n \n\nPcs are two-dimensional synthetic tetrapyrrolic compounds constituted by \n\nfour isoindole units presenting an 18 ?-electron system, which is delocalized over \n\nan arrangement of alternated carbon and nitrogen atoms. They present a strong \n\nabsorption band in the red region of the spectrum (630 to 750 nm) mainly in the \n\nnear-infrared (IR) region (Figure 1.5) which confers a bright green/blue color that \n\nhave a great interest in using Pcs as dyes in pigments industries (47).  \n\n \n\n400 500 600 700 800\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\nWavelenght (nm)\n\nA\nb\n\ns\n\n \n\nFigure 1.5. Typical UV/Visible (UV/Vis) spectrum of metallo Pcs (MPcs). \n\n \n\nThese compounds are able to form stable metallocomplexes with many metal \n\ncations (e.g. zinc (Zn), silicon (Si) and ruthenium (Ru)) using the four central pyrrole \n\nnitrogens of the macrocycle (48). The hydrogen atoms of the central cavity can be \n\nreplaced by more than 70 elements and the coordination number of the square-\n\nplanar Pc is four. Thus, according to its size and oxidation state, the metal can be \n\ninserted into the Pc core. When the metal has a higher coordination number, \n\npyramidal, tetrahedral or octahedral structures result with one or two axial ligands \n\n(46). The internal and external positions of the fused benzene ring are also \n\ncommonly known as ?- and ?-positions, respectively (Figure 1.6). The chemical \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\nversatility of this class of macrocycles allows the tuning of their physicochemical \n\nproperties, making Pcs promising PS agents for PDT in the treatment of cancer (49). \n\n \n\n                \n\nFigure 1.6. Structures of MPc- and metal-free-Pcs (H2Pc). \n\n \n\nSynthetic routes \n\n \n\nThe synthesis of Pcs can be carried out either by cyclotetramerization of the \n\nappropriately substituted precursors, usually phthalonitriles (Scheme 1.1) or \n\ndiiminoisoindolines. Most often, this reaction is conducted in the presence of metal \n\nions that act as template during the ring formation. Not only the metal-template \n\neffect, but also the thermodynamic stabilization and the aromaticity involved on the \n\nPc macrocycle formation, are responsible for the ring closure (50).  \n\n \n\n \n\nScheme 1.1. Schematic representation of the synthesis of a MPc using a phthalonitrile as \n\nprecursor in the presence of metal ions (M). \n\n \n\nOwing to their extended conjugation, Pcs exhibit a high aggregation \n\ntendency, by ?-? interactions and reduction of solubility, that reduce their ADME \n\nproperties and compromise their photophysical characteristics (i.e. ability to \n\ngenerate 1O2 and other related ROS). To overcome such limitations, a wide variety \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\nof substituents can be introduced either axially or at the periphery of the macrocycle. \n\n(47). Due to their promising studies for biological applications, Pcs coordinated \n\ncentrally with a Si atom will be explored in this dissertation. \n\n \n\n4.1 Silicon Phthalocyanines \n\n \n\nAn important feature of silicon phthalocyanines (SiPcs) is their four-\n\ncoordinate central atom that allows many structural possibilities and thus a flexibility \n\nof the synthetic design, such as the functionalization of two axial ligands (51). The \n\naxial functionalization reduces aggregation, increasing the solubility in a variety of \n\nsolvents, photosensitizing efficiency as well as fine-tune fluorescence and triplet \n\nstate characteristics (52). The first approved SiPc conjugated with axial ligands was \n\nPc4 (53-55). This PS showed excellent results both in vitro and in vivo and presently \n\nare being made the clinical trials for the treatment of cutaneous neoplasms (56). \n\nPc4 contains two axial ligands consisting of a hydroxyl and a dimethylamino-\n\npropylsiloxy group (Figure 1.7) and has an absorption band in the therapeutic \n\nwindow (670 nm) (57). This PS demonstrated excellent cellular uptake and \n\nphotodynamic efficacy as well as effectiveness in eliminating human \n\nimmunodeficiency virus-infected cells (58). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.7. Pc4 chemical structure. \n\n \n\nMany others axial conjugated SiPcs are being developed and tested in vitro, \n\nand will be highlighted the ones conjugated with biomolecules, such as proteins \n\n(59,60), nucleosides (61), carbohydrates (45, 62-64) and mAb (34) (Table 1.3).  \n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n16 \n\n \n\nTable 1.3.

In order to \n\nminimize these problems, the development of new Pcs linked to biochemical motifs \n\nhave been developed. \n\nCarbohydrates are potential candidates as PS-delivery systems because \n\nthey are biocompatible molecules with a rapid cellular uptake and with a specific \n\nrecognition by lectin proteins (36). Lectins\u2019 hydroxyl groups make the sugars suited \n\nfor directional acceptor/donor hydrogen bonds (65). It is expected that the specific \n\n(non-covalent) binding of carbohydrates with lectins promotes the accumulation of \n\nthe glycoconjugate inside cells by the endocytic pathway (66). Furthermore, certain \n\ncarbohydrate-binding lectins are overexpressed in tumor cells (67). Therefore, \n\ngalactose molecules have been conjugated with PSs, since they can be recognized \n\nby galactose-binding proteins overexpressed in cancer cells (namely galectin-1 and \n\n-3) (68). Galectins are small soluble proteins (molecular weight 14-35 kDa) with \n\ncarbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) which are responsible for the specific and \n\nindividual binding of each galectin to carbohydrates (69). Particularizing to galectin-\n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\n1, this protein exhibits dual localization, being found in both intracellular (nucleus \n\nand cytoplasm) and extracellular (cell surface and medium) compartments (70). \n\nIntracellularly, it is involved in fundamental processes such as pre-mRNA (precursor \n\nmessenger ribonucleic acid) splicing and on the regulation of intracellular signaling \n\npathways (e.g. mitosis, apoptosis and cell-cycle progression) after binding \n\nintracellular ligands. Extracellularly, it can bind to cell-surface glycoconjugates that \n\ncontain suitable galactose-containing oligosaccharides (71). Therefore, the coupling \n\nof a Pc with galactose moieties can provide a distinct advantage for the efficacious \n\ntargeting of the PS to cancer cells due to the presence of galactose-binding proteins \n\nthat are overexpressed in those cells, and that can facilitate the PS cellular uptake \n\n(Figure 1.8). \n\n \n\nFigure 1.8. Possible interaction of a SiPc conjugated with two galactose molecules with \n\ngalactose binding proteins overexpressed in cancer cells. \n\n \n\n \n\nMany PSs conjugated with carbohydrates showed promising in vitro results \n\nand are currently being tested in vivo. Maillard reported the synthesis of a \n\nglycoconjugated chlorin (42). Fujimoto has conjugated a Por with galactose and its \n\nmolecular delivery to hepatocytes (43). Silva reported the synthesis of a Pc \n\ncontaining eight dendritic units of galactose (72) which is able to target and kill BC \n\ncells through mediated interaction with galactose-binding proteins overexpressed in \n\nthose cells (40). Particularizing to SiPcs, there are only few reports of their axial \n\nconjugation to carbohydrates. Ng and co-workers reported the conjugation of \n\nunsymmetrical SiPcs with a ?-cyclodextrin (62), of two SiPcs with acetal-protected \n\nglucose molecules (63) and also a SiPc with one or two axial acetal-protected \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n18 \n\n \n\ngalactose substituent(s) (Table 1.3) (45). The in vitro and in vivo results showed a \n\nhigh photodynamic activity of these compounds against HepG2 human \n\nhepatocellular carcinoma, which can be attributed to the high cellular uptake and \n\nefficiency to generate 1O2, as well as tumor growth retardation. These compounds \n\nare therefore promising PSs for PDT. However, there are no reports related with the \n\nsynthesis and validation of SiPcs conjugation with deprotected sugar substituents. \n\nRecently, the emerging role of dendrimers in biological systems has \n\nhighlighted their potential benefits for the preparation of new anticancer drugs. \n\nDendrimers are highly branched nanostructures with many arms emanating from a \n\ncentral core (73). Besides improving the biocompatibility and the photochemical \n\nproprieties of PSs, they also create multivalent interactions with more than one \n\nreceptor binding site, contributing to an active cancer cell targeting, improving \n\ncellular recognition (Figure 1.9). Additionally, they act as nanocarriers, leading to \n\nthe enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect that is characteristic of tumor \n\ntissues (37). Several PSs (Por and Pc) conjugated with galacto-dendritic units have \n\nbeen synthesized and tested in vitro in BC cells with very promising results (40,72). \n\nHowever, there are no reports of the axial conjugation of Pcs with galacto-dendritic \n\nunits. \n\n \n\nFigure 1.9. Illustration of the interaction of a Pc conjugated with eight galacto-dendritic units \n\nto a lectin overexpressed in tumoral cells. Adapted from (40). \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\n5. Photodynamic therapy in clinical applications \n\n \n\nPDT has been mostly restricted to the treatment of melanomas and solid \n\ntumors occurring in externally accessible cavities, like the bladder and the \n\nesophagus (3). PS can be administrated intravenously or topically and then it should \n\nbe preferentially accumulated in the desired tissue (Figure 1.10). After a \n\npredetermined time, known as the drug-to-light interval, light is directly applied into \n\nthe tumor by the use of modern fiber-optic systems and various types of endoscopy, \n\nwhich allows an accurately light targeting to almost any part of the body (74). The \n\nperiod of time between PS administration and the start of illumination varies \n\nbetween 5 min to 24 h, or more. The most efficient light systems are lasers and light \n\nemitting diodes (LEDs) sources with relatively narrow spectral bandwidths and high \n\nfluence rates. Lasers can also be coupled into fibers with diffusing tips to treat \n\ntumors in the urinary bladder and the digestive tract (3). \n\n1O2 generated by the activated PS is believed to be responsible for tumor \n\ndestruction (75). Once 1O2 has a very short lifetime, it is deactivated before it can \n\nescape from the cell in which it was produced. Photobleaching can be an advantage \n\navoiding an overall skin photosensitivity which is one of the main side effects in \n\npatients treated with PDT. Total healing of the area after PDT may take from 2 to 6 \n\nweeks. During this time, the patient will be light sensitive (due to PS accumulation \n\nin the skin) and must be protected from direct light (3). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.10. PDT protocol in oncology. Adapted from (76). \n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\nIn order to improve the therapeutic index of treatments in modern oncology, \n\nmany therapeutic modalities with non-overlapping toxicities can be combined. There \n\nare two general approaches that may increase the antitumor effectiveness of PDT, \n\nmostly in elderly or debilitated patients who less tolerate more intensive therapeutic \n\nregimes, such as: i) sensitization of tumor cells to PDT (77) and ii) interference with \n\ncytoprotective molecular responses triggered by PDT in surviving tumor or stromal \n\ncells. Therefore, any interactions between PDT and PSs will be confined to the \n\nirradiated area (3). Despite all its applications, PDT has the limitation that cannot \n\ncure advanced disseminated diseases because it requires irradiation of the whole \n\nbody with appropriate doses and that is not possible with the present technologies. \n\nHowever, for advanced diseases, PDT can improve quality of life and lengthen \n\nsurvival of the patients (74). For early or localized diseases, this technique can be \n\na selective and curative therapy with many potential advantages over available \n\nalternatives. \n\n \n\n5.1 Bladder Cancer \n\n \n\nBC is a disease that affects many patients worldwide. It has a high rate of \n\nmortality and recurrence (78). Nowadays, many advances have been attempted to \n\nunderstand the nature of this disease and to develop new treatment approaches \n\n(79). In this section, the focus is on BC physiopathology, incidence and treatment. \n\n \n\nPhysiopathology \n\n \n\nBladder is a hollow, balloon shaped organ in the pelvic floor containing three \n\nhistological layers: 1) urothelium, 2) lamina propria (suburothelial loose connective \n\ntissue) and 3) detrusor or muscularis propria. After muscularis propria there is a \n\nperivesical fat that covers the superior surface and the upper part separating the \n\nbladder from the nearby organs (Figure 1.11) (80,81). Urothelium is a highly \n\nspecialized transitional epithelium layer that creates an interface between \n\npathogens and other bladder tissues through many defense mechanisms. Its cell \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\nturnover is very slow, but capable of a very rapid proliferation in response to injury \n\n(82).  \n\nBC progression is based on four stages that depend on the location of the \n\ntumor in the bladder layers. The tumor grows from the inside of the bladder wall \n\n(stage 0) and can spread into the lamina propria layer (stage I), then into the \n\nmuscular layer (stage II), penetrate the perivesical tissues (stage III) and finally \n\ninvade other organs (stage IV): prostate, uterus, vagina, abdominal wall and pelvic \n\nwall (Figure 1.11). Stages 0 and I are superficial or non muscle-invasive while \n\nstages II, III and IV are muscle-invasive cancers. When the cancer extends from its \n\noriginal place (in the bladder) to another part of the body (stage IV) it is named \n\nmetastatic BC (79). The classification of BC staging comes from the Tumor-Node-\n\nMetastases (TNM) system which is based on the size and penetration of the tumor \n\non the tissues of the bladder (Table 1.4) (81). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.11. Bladder layers and BC progression. Adapted from (83). \n\n  \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n22 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1.4.

BC is a pathology \n\nthat frequently does not have symptoms associated. However, when it does, the \n\nmost common ones are painless hematuria, that can be detected by a chemical \n\nreagent strip for hemoglobin and spun sediment microscopy on voided urine, and \n\nirritative symptoms such as frequency, urgency and pain. Normally, screening is \n\nperformed by combining different modalities: the surgical procedure transurethral \n\nresection (TUR), bimanual palpation before and after TUR, fluorescence \n\ncystoscopy, radiological imaging techniques and histopathological examination \n\n(79). \n\nThe non muscle-invasive BC (Ta (70%) and T1 (20%), Table 1.4) is the most \n\nfrequently diagnosed. Its progression to muscle-invasive BC and rate of recurrence \n\ndepends on the tumor grade, stage and size, the presence of CIS (Table 1.4), the \n\noccurrence of multifocal lesions and the prior recurrence. Ta tumors rarely become \n\nmuscle-invasive, but high grade T1 tumors and flat CIS lesions (Table 1.4) have an \n\nincreased propensity to progress. Although CIS belongs to the non muscle-invasive \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n23 \n\n \n\n(10%) BC group, it is associated to a higher aggressiveness due to molecular \n\nalterations that are characteristic of muscle-invasive BC (84). \n\n \n\nStatistics \n\n \n\nBC is the 9th most common cancer worldwide. The age standardized rate \n\n(ASR) is 10.1 per 100,000 for males and 2.5 per 100,000 for females. More than 12 \n\nmillion of new cancer cases occur annually worldwide, of those 5.4 million occur in \n\ndeveloped countries and 6.7 million in developing countries (78). In Europe, \n\nmortality rates increased in Southern and Eastern Europe between the mid-1950s \n\nand late 1980s, but a decline has been observed in several Northern European \n\ncountries over the last two decades (79). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.12. Most frequent cancers in Europe (2012). The values correspond to estimated \n\nincidence (left) and mortality (right) in both males and females (85). \n\n \n\n \n\nPredisposition factors include smoking, exposure to aromatic amines and \n\ninorganic chemicals in the workplace, chronic cystitis associated with foreign bodies, \n\npelvic radiation therapy, exposure to the chemotherapeutic prodrug \n\ncyclophosphamide (79) and parasitic infections (86) in the Middle East and parts of \n\nAfrica where schistosomiasis is a widespread problem. Most bladder carcinogens \n\nexert their action by direct contact with the bladder epithelium. Inhaled or ingested \n\ncompounds that are either directly carcinogenic or that can be transformed by the \n\nbody in carcinogenic byproducts, reach the urinary bladder because they are \n\nexcreted via the urine.

The most applied surgical procedure is TUR that can be used to \n\ndiagnose, stage, and treat the majority of primary and recurrent bladder tumors. This \n\ntreatment has three main goals: i) to provide pathologic material to determine the \n\nhistologic type and grade of bladder tumor; ii) to determine the presence, depth and \n\ntype of tumor invasion; and iii) to remove all visible and microscopic superficial and \n\ninvasive tumor(s) (88). If there are multiple recurrences, the patient is given a topical \n\nimmunotherapy that consists in intravesical instillations of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin \n\n(BCG). This therapy is only applied in non muscle-invasive BC with no side effects \n\nand is an easy deliver in bladder due to its great accessibility (89). However, this \n\ntreatment fails in 30-40% of patients, and 30-40% of those had an initial response \n\nthat relapsed due to intolerance, recurrence and resistance of patients to BCG (90). \n\nIn more advanced stages of the tumor, radiotherapy, radical cystectomy and \n\nchemotherapy are the therapeutics of choice (91,92). Though, these conventional \n\ntherapies might cause unwanted side effects and in some cases they are not \n\ncompletely effective in the destruction of the tumor, leading to a high risk of \n\nrecurrence and progression. Thus, in order to preserve the bladder and its function, \n\nthere is a clinical interest on using alternative treatments. \n\nThe clinical urological interest in PDT is focused on the preservation of the \n\norgan and its function because there are no significant changes in tissue \n\ntemperature, and the preservation of connective tissue leads to minimal fibrosis. \n\nCurrent scientific research on PDT for BC treatment is based on the development \n\nof tumor selective drugs (33, 40, 93). BCs are suitable targets for PDT because their \n\ninterior can be assessed by endoscopy. The bladder geometry should allow an \n\nimproved and homogeneous light delivery and the bladder tissue is relatively more \n\ntranslucent when compared to other human tissues (3). The first PS used to treat \n\nrecurrent BC was HpD, in 1975 (94). After this, in 1993, Photofrin\u00ae was approved in \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n\nCanada. However, both PSs could only be used for superficial BC, once for whole-\n\nbladder PDT, there was a high incidence of side effects, such as urinary frequency, \n\npain and persistent reduction in bladder capacity (23, 95, 96). These complications \n\nwere due to the excessive light doses and the non-uniform light delivery in the early \n\nstudies. Nseyo et al showed that, for standardized protocols, reducing the drug and \n\nlight dose and decreasing the light penetration in tissues to wavelengths of 514 nm \n\n(green light), also gives a good tumor response rate for superficial lesions without \n\ntransmural bladder wall injury or treatment-related morbidity (97). This became an \n\nexcellent treatment option of CIS, although it was not been fully evaluated. Another \n\nPS that has been used for recurrent superficial bladder cancer is Levulan\u00ae by given \n\na single PDT treatment or in combination with mitomycin C, which resulted in a \n\ncomplete response rates at 18-24 months without persistent reduction in bladder \n\ncapacity (98-101). Finally, as mentioned before, various therapeutic modalities with \n\nnon-overlapping toxicities could also be combined. Pan et al (102) hypothesized that \n\nPDT combined with intravesical BCG would form an auto-vaccine for BC. Tumor \n\ncells treated in vitro by PDT can be used to generate potent cancer vaccines. \n\nHypothetically, tumor cells destroyed by PDT could be treated with BCG to elicit and \n\namplify the immunological response, which would lead to the formation of an in-situ \n\nauto-vaccine against urothelial tumor cells, whether local or systemic.  \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n26 \n\n \n\n6. Objectives and working plan \n\n \n\nThe necessity of finding new approaches for cancer treatment in order to \n\npreserve the quality of life of the patient by reducing side effects has been \n\ncaptivating the attention of many research groups. Being PDT a less invasive \n\ntherapy that selectively attack the cancer cells, the goal is to find ideal PSs suitable \n\nfor many types of cancers. BC is a good target for PDT due to its geometry that \n\nallows an endoscopy access.  \n\nAn ideal PS is not always easy to find because it should be endowed with \n\nspecific features as described above (page 7). The development of Pcs for PDT has \n\nbeen especially promising due to their unique photochemical properties. However, \n\nPcs have reduced water solubility and low specificity to the cancer tissue. Therefore, \n\nthe aims of this Master\u2019s dissertation were to synthesize water soluble SiPcs \n\nconjugated with galacto-dendritic units that will increase the specificity to tumoral \n\ncells, to study their photophysical and photochemical properties, and to validate \n\nthem as photodynamic therapeutic agent against BC cells.  \n\n \n\nWorking Plan \n \n\n- Synthesis of novel water soluble galacto-conjugated SiPcs; \n\n- Study of their photophysical and photochemical properties: \n\no Solubility in DMSO, DMF (Dimethylformamide) and PBS (Phosphate \n\nbuffered saline); \n\no Fluorescence emission spectrum in DMF; \n\no Photostability when irradiated with red light; \n\no Generation of 1O2 using DPBF as 1O2 scavenger; \n\n- Validate their photodynamic potential against a human bladder cancer cell \n\nline, UM-UC-3, with high levels of galectin-1: \n\no Determine the uptake of the galacto-conjugates by BC; \n\no Quantify the levels of ROS after PSs-PDT; \n\no Determine the toxicity in darkness (MTT assay); \n\no Determine the phototoxicity after light activation (MTT assay); \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n27 \n\n \n\nThe elaboration of this master thesis took place in three different institutions \n\nunder the supervision of Dr Jo\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 (University of Aveiro, UA), Dr Tom\u00e1s Torres \n\nCebada (University Autonoma of Madrid, UAM) and Dr Rosa Fernandes (Institute \n\nfor Biomedical Imaging and Life Sciences, IBILI, from Medical Faculty of Coimbra). \n\nAt UAM and UA was performed the synthesis of the PSs, at UA the photophysical \n\nand photochemical studies and at IBILI the photobiological studies. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nScheme 1.2 Chronology and institutions involved in the studies of this thesis. \n\nMarch 2015 \n\nSynthesis \nPhotophysical and \n\nphotochemical studies Photobiological studies \n\nSeptember 2014 July 2015 \n\nUA/UAM IBILI \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n28 \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n CHAPTER II \n\n      RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n30 \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPart 1.  \n\nNovel galacto-conjugated silicon phthalocyanines: \n\n synthesis and characterization \n\n \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n32 \n\n \n\n1. Novel galacto-conjugated silicon phthalocyanines: synthesis \n\nand characterization \n\n \n\n1.1 Overview \n\n \n\nNowadays, PDT research is focused on the development of new PSs with \n\nimproved photophysical and photobiological properties (3). Pcs derivatives have \n\nhigh absorption in the visible region of the spectrum (around 650 nm), allowing much \n\ndeeper tissue penetration for therapy. These PSs present a long lifetime of the triplet \n\nexcited state which will induce high production of 1O2 (49). Based on these \n\nproperties, Pcs have emerged as a promising class of PSs (103). However, the \n\nmajor problem is their insolubility in physiological fluids due to their hydrophobic \n\nskeletons, which leads to Pcs aggregation, affecting their photophysical properties. \n\nAdditionally, the Pcs\u2019 core has not specificity for cancer cells. To overcome that, a \n\nwide variety of substituents can be introduced either axially or at the periphery of \n\nthe macrocycle (40, 45, 93). Knowing that cancer cells have increased levels of \n\ngalactose-binding proteins, the combination of carbohydrate moieties with \n\nmacrocycles improves PS uptake and PDT efficacy. Furthermore, these \n\ncarbohydrate units can also provide water-solubility to the macrocycles (16). \n\nThe aim of this section is to describe the synthetic steps attempted to obtain \n\nSiPcs conjugated axially with galacto-dendritic units (Figure 2.1). The structure of \n\nthe compounds was corroborated using spectroscopic and spectrometric \n\ntechniques (nuclear magnetic resonance NMR, matrix-assisted laser \n\ndesorption/ionization MALDI-MS and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, \n\nESI+-MS). These studies were performed at University Autonoma of Madrid and \n\nUniversity of Aveiro. \n\n \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n33 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 SiPcs axially conjugated with two galacto-dendritic units. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.2 Synthesis of galacto-dendritic units \n\n \n\nHerein we report the synthesis of two galacto-dendritic units, differing only in \n\nthe linker chain, and their further axial coordination with the SiPc macrocycle \n\n(Scheme 2.1). 1,2:3,4-di-O-isopropylidene-?-D-galactopyranose was chosen as the \n\ncarbohydrate moiety, in order to relate these new compounds with our previous \n\nstudies, which have already shown the importance of this carbohydrate unit in the \n\nphotophysical, photochemical and photobiological results (15, 40, 72, 104). The \n\nselected dendritic framework was 2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine (TCT) because of its \n\nwell-known selective reactivity concerning the substitution of each chlorine atoms at \n\ndifferent temperatures. The synthesis of dendritic units 2 and 3 was performed in \n\ntwo steps as depicted in Scheme 2.1. Although dendritic unit 3 is less nucleophilic \n\nthan dendritic unit 2, it was expected that the electronegativity of the oxygen atom \n\nwould allow the formation of a more stable bond with the silicon atom of the SiPc \n\ncore than the one formed with the sulfur atom (105). \n\n \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n34 \n\n \n\n \n\nScheme 2.1.

The nucleophilic \n\nsubstitution of the TCT by the galactose moieties was carried out in dry toluene, in \n\nthe presence of an excess of N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) and stirred during \n\n48 h, under argon (Ar). The desired compound was purified by column \n\nchromatography on silica gel using a mixture of hexane (Hex) and ethyl acetate \n\n(AcOEt) (8:2 to 7:3 v/v) as eluent with a 66% of yield (lower than the one reported \n\nin the literature) (72). The carbohydrate units are linked to the TCT by the hydroxyl \n\ngroup located in carbon C-6. The following step to produce compound 2, was based \n\non the addition of 1,3-dimercaptopropane to compound 1 in a reaction mixture with \n\nthe same conditions as the ones to achieve compound 1, providing compound 2, \n\nwith an yield of 75% (lower than the one reported in the literature) (72). \n\nTo obtain the new compound 3, 1,3-dipropanediol was added to compound \n\n1, in a reaction mixture by using the same conditions employed for the synthesis of \n\ncompound 2, but using sodium hydride (NaH) instead of DIPEA. The NMR and ESI+ \n\nMS studies demonstrated that the desired compound was not obtained because \n\nNaH hydrolyzed the galactose moieties of compound 1. Therefore, NaH was \n\nsubstituted by DIPEA, and compound 3 was obtained with 61% yield.  \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n35 \n\n \n\nThe 1H NMR spectrum of compound 1 showed four singlets between ? 1.31-\n\n1.49 ppm attributed to the isopropylidene methyl groups. The proton 5'-H appeared \n\nas a triple doublet at ? 4.18 ppm (J = 1.4, 6.4 and 6.5 Hz). The signals of protons 4'-\n\nH and 2'-H emerged as multiplets at ? 4.31 ppm, while the protons 6'-H came out at \n\n? 4.53 ppm. The signal of the proton 3\u2019-H appeared as a double doublet at ? 4.62 \n\nppm (J = 2.4 and 7.9 Hz). Finally, the doublet at ? 5.52 ppm (J = 5.0 Hz) was \n\nattributed to the resonance of the 1'-H.  \n\nRegarding compound 2, the 1H NMR spectrum also showed four singlets \n\nbetween ? 1.32-1.49 ppm attributed to the resonances of the isopropylidene methyl \n\ngroups. Then the 1,3-dimercaptopropane methylene and thiol groups appeared as \n\nmultiplet signals: Hb (CH2CH2CH2SH) ? 2.02, Hc (CH2CH2CH2SH) 2.64, 2.75-2.80 \n\n(SH) and Ha (CH2CH2CH2SH) 3.23 ppm. The remaining signals of the galactoses\u2019 \n\nprotons were the same as the ones corresponding to compound 1. \n\nFinally, compound 3 had a 1H NMR spectrum, shown in Figure 2.2, similar \n\nof compounds 1 and 2, having also two multiplets and a double doublet \n\ncorresponding now to the 1,3-propanediol methylene groups: Hb (CH2CH2CH2OH) \n\n? 1.99, Hc (CH2CH2CH2OH) 3.76 and Ha (CH2CH2CH2OH) 4.54 ppm (J = 6.3 Hz), \n\nrespectively. These last three signals were not observed in the 1H NMR spectrum \n\nof the final product prepared when using NaH as a base (route iiia), Scheme 2.1), \n\nwhich was the proof that we did not obtained the desired compound.

Then, once the aim of this newly PSs was to be \n\nrecognized by the galactose-binding proteins overexpressed in cancer cells, it was \n\nnecessary to hydrolyze the isopropylidene groups of the galactose molecules. The \n\nhydrolysis attempts were performed by employing two different approaches: i) by \n\nusing TFA/H2O (9:1) as solvent, at room temperature (rt), during 5 h (72); and ii) \n\nwith bromotrimethylsilane (TMSBr), using dichloromethane (DCM) as solvent, at rt, \n\nduring 24 h (106). However, both hydrolysis resulted in the loss of the galactose \n\nmolecules, thus producing SiPc dihydroxide (SiPc(OH)2). \n\n \n\n \n\nScheme 2.2.

Upfield there were two \n\ndouble doublets that corresponded to the 6\u2019-H protons: ? -2.37 (J = 8.8 and 9.3 Hz) \n\nand -1.70 (J = 5.3 and 8.3 Hz) ppm. The protons of the isopropylidene methyl groups \n\nappeared as singlets between ? 0.30 and 0.79 ppm. In the middle of this range, it \n\nwas also possible to observe protons 5\u2019-H at ? 0.68 ppm, which emerged together, \n\nin a virtual singlet, with one of the isopropylidene methyl groups. Proton 4\u2019-H was \n\nlocalized at ? 0.76 ppm as a double doublet (J = 0.8 and 9.2 Hz). Then, there were \n\ntwo double doublets, 3\u2019-H and 2\u2019-H, at ? 3.22 (J = 0.4 and 8.5 Hz) and 3.32 (J = 1.6 \n\nand 5.4 Hz) ppm, respectively, and a doublet corresponding to 1\u2019-H at ? 4.37 ppm \n\n(J = 5.0 Hz).

The \n\nresonances of the isopropylidene methyl groups appeared as singlets between ? \n\n1.38 and 1.55 ppm. Protons 5'-H exhibited a triple doublet at ? 4.22 ppm (J = 1.0, \n\n4.0 and 4.0 Hz), protons 4\u2019-H, 2\u2019-H and 6\u2019-H emerged as multiplets at ? 4.32, 4.39 \n\nand 4.42 ppm, 3-H\u2019 protons resonance came out as a double doublet at ? 4.69 ppm \n\n(J = 4.7 and 1.4 Hz) and the doublet at ? 5.64 ppm (J= 2.9 Hz) corresponded to 1'-\n\nH.

Even though some photophysical, photochemical and in \n\nvitro studies of SiPcGal2 are already published (45, 109), we have also used this \n\nSiPc in our studies for comparative purposes between the axial conjugation with \n\nprotected-galacto-dendritic units (SiPcGal4) and with protected-galactose \n\nmolecules (SiPcGal2). Studies with the commercially available SiPc(OH)2 were also \n\nperformed in order to evaluate the Pc-core properties. SiPc(OH)2 was obtained by \n\nreacting SiPcCl2 with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in methanol (MeOH) at rt, during \n\n30 min. \n\nThere are no reports of the removal of the isopropylidene groups from sugar \n\nmoieties axially conjugated to SiPc. Thus, in those kind of compounds described in \n\nliterature the researchers use a Cremophor EL emulsion for the in vitro assays that \n\nstabilize the solutions of nonpolar materials in aqueous systems, preventing their \n\naggregation (45, 62, 63).

Additionally, studies with SiPc(OH)2 were performed on HeLa \n\ncells by incorporation of the PS inside the silica shell, in order to improve its \n\ndispersibility in aqueous environments (111). These are alternative strategies that \n\ncould have been applied to the obtained compounds in the photobiological studies \n\nperformed in this thesis. \n\nIt has to be taken into account that the idea of synthesizing a PS with affinity \n\nto the galactose-binding proteins overexpressed in cancer cells was unfortunately \n\nnot accomplished because it was not possible to deprotect the galactose moieties \n\nof SiPcGal4 and SiPcGal2 thus preventing the interaction of the PS with those \n\nproteins. Therefore, the studies that will be further presented on this Master\u2019s thesis \n\nwill be mostly to evaluate the promising properties of the SiPc core as well as the \n\ninfluence that axial substituents have in the Pc hydrophilicity.  \n\nOther routes can be performed to obtain the deprotected compounds, such \n\nas to deprotect first the galacto-dendritic units or the galactose molecules (112) and \n\nthen axially conjugate them to the SiPc core. There are no papers that use that \n\ntechnique on SiPc, but it was reported the synthesis of a Por-glicopolymer based on \n\na one-pot conjugation (combination of multi-reactions) (113) and also a gluco-\n\nconjugated ZnPc via Click reaction (generation of substances quickly and reliably \n\nby joining small units together) (114). \n\n  \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n42 \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n43 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPart 2 \n\nPhotophysical and photochemical studies of galacto-conjugates \n\n  \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n44 \n\n \n\n2. Photophysical and photochemical studies of galacto-\n\nconjugates \n\n \n\nIn this section, photophysical and photochemical properties of SiPcGal4 and \n\nSiPcGal2 were determined and compared with those for SiPc(OH)2. UV-Visible \n\n(UV/Vis) characterization, PSs solubility in organic and aqueous solvents, \n\nfluorescence properties and ability to generate 1O2 were evaluated. These studies \n\nwere performed at the University of Aveiro. \n\n \n\n2.1  UV-Visible characterization, water solubility and fluorescence \n\nemission  \n\n \n\nThe electronic absorption spectra of SiPcGal4, SiPcGal2 and SiPc(OH)2 \n\nwere initially acquired in the organic solvents DMF and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). \n\nAll the SiPcs at 10 \u00b5M gave typical UV/Vis spectra for non-aggregated SiPcs \n\nshowing an intense and sharp Q band in the red visible region. That Q band was \n\nobserved at 677, 669 and 667 nm for SiPcGal4, SiPcGal2 and SiPc(OH)2, \n\nrespectively, and the Soret bands around 348 nm (Figure 2.4). To determine the \n\nsolubility of these compounds in an aqueous buffered solution, their absorption \n\nspectra were also acquired in PBS (Figure 2.4). This study is a critical parameter \n\nfor the PSs\u2019 PDT application, since in polar solvents, macrocycles have high \n\naggregation tendency, disfavoring their efficacy as PDT agents (47). In PBS (3 % \n\nDMSO), the Q band of SiPcGal4 and SiPcGal2 undergo a significant broadening, \n\nwhich is a spectral feature of aggregated SiPcs. This feature was more evident for \n\nSiPc(OH)2 showing a higher aggregation of this compound. Therefore, these results \n\ndemonstrated that the axial coordination increases the solubility of a SiPc in an \n\naqueous solution, but to achieve strong hydrophilicity, the isopropylidene groups \n\nshould be removed.  \n\nThe extinction coefficients (?) of the SiPcs in these three solvents are \n\nsummarized in Table 2.1. The ? values of SiPcGal2 and SiPc(OH)2 in DMF and \n\nDMSO, respectively, are already described in literature (45,115), and are similar \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n45 \n\n \n\nwith the ones described in this section.

UV/Vis studies with increasing concentrations of the \n\ncompounds (0 to 10 \u00b5M) in PBS solution containing DMSO (up to 3%) showed that \n\nSiPcGal4 and SiPcGal2 strictly follow the Beer-Lambert law at the studied \n\nconcentrations suggesting their application in in vitro studies at concentrations \n\nbelow 10 \u00b5M (Figure 2.5). The same did not happened with SiPc(OH)2, because \n\nthe absorbance at that concentration was very low and higher concentrations \n\nimplied a percentage of DMSO higher than 3% (corresponding to 10 \u00b5M), which is \n\nnot suitable for cellular assays. Previous assays performed by our group have \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n46 \n\n \n\ndescribed that a percentage of DMSO higher than 0.5% significantly reduces the \n\nviability of human bladder cancer cells (UM-UC-3) (40,76), the same cells that we \n\nintended to use on the present study. Thus, even at a concentration of 10 \u00b5M, the \n\npercentage of DMSO was too high to be used. Therefore, only concentrations bellow \n\n1.66 \u00b5M of SiPcGal4 and SiPcGal2 in PBS (% DMSO ? 0.5) could be used for the \n\nin vitro PDT assays without compromising their phototoxic effectiveness evaluation. \n\n \n\n400 500 600 700 800\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nA\n\nWavelenght (nm)\n\nA\nb\n\ns\n\n0 5 10\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\ny=0.05393x\n\nr\n2\n=0.9575\n\n[SiPcGal4] (?M)\n\nA\nb\n\ns\n a\n\nt \n6\n8\n6\nn\n\nm\n\n400 500 600 700 800\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nB\n\nWavelenght (nm)\n\nA\nb\n\ns\n0 5 10\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6 y=0.06150x\n\nr\n2\n=0.9813\n\n[SiPcGal2] (?M)\n\nA\nb\n\ns\n a\n\nt \n6\n9\n8\nn\n\nm\n\n \n\nFigure 2.5.

DPBF was used as 1O2 scavenger (63). DPBF \n\nis a yellow colored compound with a maximum of absorption at 415 nm, that reacts \n\nwith 1O2 and it is oxidized to a colorless compound, the dibenzoylbenzene: thanks \n\nto this structural change, is possible to measure the scavenger absorption decay \n\n(116). The ability of SiPcGal2 and SiPc(OH)2 to generate 1O2 was also determined, \n\nin order to evaluate the influence of the axial conjugation with dendritic units of \n\ngalactose and the SiPc-core ability in the production of 1O2. SiPcGal4, SiPcGal2 and \n\nSiPc(OH)2 (0.3 \u00b5M), were able to photo-oxidize DPBF (30 \u00b5M) (Figure 2.8). Both \n\ngalacto-conjugates demonstrated to be potent generators of 1O2, once SiPcGal4 \n\nand SiPcGal2 were able to decompose 50% of DPBF after 15 min and 7 min of \n\nirradiation, respectively. The behavior of SiPcGal2 was similar to the one of \n\nSiPc(OH)2. These results showed that the conjugation of SiPc with protected \n\ngalactose moieties or galacto-dendritic units does not compromise the 1O2 \n\nproduction. Therefore, these studies showed the promising ability of the SiPc-core \n\nitself in the generation of this ROS. \n\n \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n49 \n\n \n\n0 10 20 30 40\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nDPBF\n\nSiPc(OH)2\n\nSiPcGal4\n\nSiPcGal2\n\nTime (min)\n\nR\ne\nla\n\nti\nv\ne\n v\n\na\nlu\n\ne\n\n \n\nFigure 2.8.

In vitro studies of the galacto-conjugates  \n\n \n\n3.1 Overview \n\n \n\nPcs are PSs with great photochemical and photophysical properties. Their \n\ncoordination to a silicon atom reduces their aggregation, since its axial \n\nfuncionalization with different bulky groups improves their solubility in a variety of \n\nsolvents. This is directly connected to photosensitizing efficiency as well as fine-\n\ntune fluorescence and triplet state characteristics (52). In Part 2 was possible to \n\nevaluate those properties, showing that SiPcGal4 and SiPcGal2 were good \n\nfluorescence labels; stable after light irradiation and efficient generators of 1O2. \n\nHowever, as the deprotection of the isopropylidene groups of galactose was not \n\nachieved in those SiPcs, these compounds demonstrated reduced solubility in PBS. \n\nIn Part 3, it will be evaluated the SiPcGal4 and SiPcGal2 potential as PSs in PDT \n\nbased on uptake, phototoxicity and ROS production after PDT studies in a human \n\nbladder cancer cell line, UM-UC-3. The potential of SiPcGal4 and SiPcGal2 as PDT \n\nagents will be compared with the non-galacto-conjugated SiPc(OH)2. UM-UC-3 cell \n\nline derives from transitional cell carcinoma, which is the most common malignant \n\ntumor arising from the urothelium. The morphology of these cells is defined by poorly \n\nadherent, displaying a stellate morphology (117). Additionally, UM-UC-3 BC cells \n\nexhibit high levels of a galactose-binding protein, galectin-1 (40). \n\nThese studies were performed at the Institute for Biomedical Imaging and \n\nLife Sciences (IBILI), Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra (FMUC). \n\n  \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n53 \n\n \n\n3.2  Uptake of galacto-conjugates by UM-UC-3 bladder cancer cells \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nScheme 2.5 Chronology of uptake studies performed after incubation of UM-UC-3 BC cells \n\nwith SiPcGal4, SiPcGal2 and SiPc(OH)2. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  Based on the fact that UM-UC-3 cells display high levels of Gal-1, we initially \n\nhypothesized that the presence of the galactose units could facilitate the entry of \n\nSiPcs into BC cells. However, as discussed in Part 1, galactose-protective groups \n\nwere not successfully removed during their synthesis. Although this fact can \n\ncompromise cellular uptake, we proceeded this work by performing their biological \n\nevaluation as potential photosensitizing agents for PDT. The BC cells UM-UC-3 \n\nwere incubated with 1.66 \u00b5M SiPcs in the dark for different periods of time (up to 4 \n\nh) in PBS containing DMSO (less than 0.5%). The fluorescence properties of these \n\ncompounds allowed the evaluation of their intracellular accumulation by quantitative \n\nspectrofluorimetry and fluorescence microscopy. Each SiPc had different \n\nfluorescence characteristics, which can be observed in the calibration slopes \n\nrepresented in section 3.2.3 of Part 3 in Methods and Materials. The uptake of \n\nSiPcGal2 and SiPcGal4 was not dependent on the incubation time, probably due to \n\ntheir aggregation in PBS (as described in Part 2 of Results and Discussion) as \n\nwell as to their incapacity of interaction with galectin-1 thanks to the galactose-\n\nhydroxyl protective groups. Previous studies with a Pc containing eight dendritic \n\nunits of galactose have demonstrated that its uptake in UM-UC-3 cancer cells is \n\ndependent on the concentration and reaches a plateau in less than 2 h (40).

Comparing the three SiPcs, \n\nSiPc(OH)2 had the higher uptake which can be explained by a non-specific \n\nmechanism caused by reduction of the membrane permeability barrier towards \n\namphiphilic SiPc(OH)2.

Cells were incubated with \n\n1.66 \u00b5M of SiPcGal4, SiPcGal2 and SiPc(OH)2 for 3 h (in darkness) and cell nuclei \n\nwere stained with DAPI. The fluorescence of the three PSs was remarkable. \n\nFuorescence microscopy confirmed the spectrofluorimetric data showing that cells \n\nincubated with the three SiPc exhibit occasional bright spots in the perinuclear \n\nregion. Apparently, for both SiPcGal4 and SiPcGal2 red spots were found outside \n\nthe cells (Figure 2.10, A and B), suggesting aggregation of the two galacto-\n\nconjugates. However, acquisition of fluorescence images in bright field could help \n\nto confirm the intracellular accumulation of the SiPc. Contrary to the other two SiPc, \n\nSiPc(OH)2 was found throughout the cytoplasm of cancer cells, showing co-\n\nlocalization with the nuclei (Figure 2.10, C). This could be due to its amphilicity \n\nrelatively to the other two PSs.  \n\n  Previous studies of intracellular fluorescence of SiPcGal2 in a Cremophor EL \n\nemulsion showed that this Pcs exhibit a co-localization with mitochondria (stained \n\nwith MitoTracker Green FM dye), but not in a exclusively way (45).

It is expected that only the non-\n\naggregated fraction of each SiPc would be able to induce cell death, though it is \n\nnecessary to perform this study at higher concentrations or in bio-stable \n\nformulations. Comparing these results with the ones described in literature, the PSs \n\nphototoxicity was promising considering the aggregation problem. PcGal16 (Pc \n\ncontaining eight deprotected dendritic units of galactose), within the same \n\nconditions, after 2 h of uptake and at a PS concentration between 0.5 and 2.5 \u00b5M, \n\nthe percentage of toxicity was of approximately 50% (2x higher than the SiPcs \n\ntoxicity) (40), showing the great potential of these galacto-conjugated SiPcs to be \n\nstudied in new approaches where the aggregation issue is resolved. Nevertheless, \n\nthese results cannot be compared to the ones of SiPcGal2 in a Cremophor EL \n\nemulsion, because the conditions were very different: irradiation potency of 40 \n\nmW.cm-2 (16 x higher) and they only used half of the irradiation time. Those results \n\nshowed that a much lower concentration of SiPcGal2 (0.10 \u00b5M) was able to \n\ndecrease cell viability by 50% (45). \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n59 \n\n \n\n3.4 SiPcGal4, SiPcGal2 and SiPc(OH)2 induced reactive oxygen species \n\nproduction after PDT in UM-UC-3 bladder cancer cells \n\n \n\nSince it is well established that ROS production has an important role in PDT-\n\ninduced cell death, the intracellular production of ROS was evaluated immediately \n\nafter PDT in cells previously incubated with 1.66 \u00b5M of the three SiPc for 3 h. In \n\norder to correlate the PSs\u2019 phototoxicity with ROS production, three different ROS-\n\nsensitive probes: DHE, H2DCFDA and MiyoPy1 (118-120) were used. DHE is able \n\nto react with O2\u00b7? and be oxidized to ethidium, which intercalates within the cell\u2019s \n\nDNA, staining the nucleus with bright red fluorescence. H2DCFDA reacts with \n\nseveral cytotoxic ROS leading to the formation of the fluorescence compound DCF. \n\nFinally, MitoPy1 selectively tracks to the mitochondria and responds to local fluxes \n\nof H2O2 by a turn on fluorescence enhancement. \n\nFirst, UM-UC-3 cells were incubated for 3 h with PBS (control) or 1.66 \u00b5M of \n\nSiPcGal4, SiPcGal2 and SiPc(OH)2, in darkness and then they were irradiated for \n\n40 min. None of the SiPcs tested induced a high production of ROS after PDT \n\n(Figure 2.13). Regarding SiPcGal4, this PS did not showed an increase in the O2\u00b7? \n\nproduction, but the generation of H2O2 and total ROS was significant. SiPcGal2 and \n\nSiPcOH2 showed, after PDT, a significant increase in the production of O2\u00b7?, H2O2 \n\nand total ROS. Once again, it is expected that only the non-aggregated fraction of \n\neach SiPc would be able to produce ROS, though it is necessary to perform this \n\nstudy at higher concentrations or in bio-stable formulations.

Conclusions and future perspectives \n\n \n\nIn this Master\u2019s dissertation, we attempted the synthesis of symmetrical water \n\nsoluble SiPcs axially coordinated with galacto-dendritic units. We also aimed the \n\nremoval of the isopropylidene galactose-protective groups from the already \n\ndescribed in the literature, SiPc axially conjugated with two galactose moieties \n\n(SiPcGal2), so that we can have a comparative compound. These galactose \n\nmolecules will be recognized by galectins (galactose-binding proteins), \n\noverexpressed in bladder tumors. Thus, after the drug design, the following step \n\nwas to study their photophysical and photochemical properties, and to validate them \n\nas photodynamic therapeutic agents against BC cells.  \n\n \n\nThe preparation of the two SiPc axially conjugated with galacto-dendritic units \n\nwas partially achieve once it was only possible to perform the coordination step of \n\nthe SiPc dichloride (SiPcCl2) with the protected galacto-dendritic units containing \n\nthe 1,3-propanediol chain (SiPcGal4). Additionally, our several attempts to \n\nhydrolyze the isopropylidene groups of the galactose molecules in either the \n\nSiPcGal4 or SiPcGal2 failed. However, a new galacto-dendritic unit [3] was obtained \n\nand in future work, different approaches could be used to then produce the desired \n\nfinal PS. One methodology that can be applied is to first hydrolyze the \n\nisopropylidene groups of compound 3, with TFA/water (9:1) and then conjugate it \n\nwith the SiPcCl2 in a reflux DMF reaction. Other route than we can undergo is to \n\nhydrolyze the isopropylidene groups of compound 1 and then conjugate it with \n\nSiPc(OH)2 in a reflux DMF reaction with potassium carbonate (K2CO3). Finally, to \n\nobtain SiPcGal2 with the deprotected galactose molecules, we can conjugate the \n\ncommercially available D-(+)-galactose with SiPcCl2 also in a reflux DMF reaction \n\nwith K2CO3. However, it is possible that we will be confronted with solubility issues \n\nto perform these reactions. \n\n \n\nRegarding the photophysical and photochemical studies, both galacto-\n\nconjugates were also compared with SiPc dihydroxide (SiPc(OH)2) in order to \n\nunderstand if the SiPc core properties are useful for future drug design. SiPcGal4 \n\n\n\nConclusion and future perspectives \n\n \n\n64 \n\n \n\nand SiPcGal2 containing the isopropylidene groups demonstrated some particular \n\nproperties that allowed us to predict the behavior of these macrocyclic cores. Of \n\ncourse there were some issues on their hydrophilicity under physiological \n\nconditions, which are fundamental for drug administration. Yet, in comparison with \n\nthe SiPc(OH)2, their water solubility was higher due to the presence of axial \n\nsubstituents that reduced their aggregation. Thus, if the isopropylidene goups\u2019 \n\nhydrolysis was successfully accomplished, the solubility would be much higher. The \n\ntypical spectra of this SiPcs contained a strong Q-band absorption at around 670 \n\nnm (therapeutic window), which allows deeper tissue penetration upon light \n\nirradiation. Both PSs also demonstrated to be good 1O2 generators and photostable \n\nupon 30 min of irradiation, which showed their high capacity to be used as PDT \n\nagents. Determination of the galacto-conjugates affinity to HSA and galectin-1 \n\nproteins could be an interesting approach to perform if we were successful in the \n\nhydrolysis of the galactoses\u2019 protective groups. HSA is a blood protein that is able \n\nto transport many drugs to the effector place demonstrating their ADME properties \n\nand galectin-1 is a galactose-binding protein overexpressed in BC cells.  \n\n \n\nFor the in vitro photodynamic assays, a human bladder cancer cell line, UM-\n\nUC-3, derived from the transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder was used. The \n\nuptake of the two galacto-conjugates was lower than the uptake of the SiPc(OH)2. \n\nThis feature resulted from non-specific mechanism caused by reduction of the \n\nmembrane permeability barrier towards amphiphilic SiPc(OH)2. However, the PSs \n\nuptake was not correlated with the concentration and incubation time increment, due \n\nto their high aggregation in PBS solution, leaving the results inconclusive. The \n\nfluorescence microscopy study suggested that aggregation outside of the cells may \n\noccur, but on the other hand, it was clear their outstanding fluorescence properties.  \n\nSiPcGal4 and SiPcGal2 were non-toxic in the dark but after photoactivation, \n\nthey induced a significant decrease in cell viability. However, once these SiPcs \n\naggregate in cells, it was expected that only a fraction of the administered Pc (non-\n\naggregated fraction) will induce cell death, thus being difficult to interpret these \n\nresults.  \n\n\n\nConclusion and future perspectives \n\n \n\n65 \n\n \n\nThe PSs-induced ROS after PDT were also studied and showed an increase \n\nof the H2O2 present in the mitochondria and also of other general ROS in the \n\ncytoplasm. If these results were from the deprotected SiPcGal4 and SiPcGal2, the \n\nnext step could be studies of fluorescence microscopy using different fluorescent \n\nprobes to study co-localization of the new PSs with different organelles. Another \n\nstudy that could be performed if we had the desired compounds, is the \n\nimmunofluorescence staining of Gal-1 to observe the subcellular localization of this \n\nlectin and the galacto-conjugates in BC cells, and their possible co-localization. \n\nSpecific inhibition of galectin-1 expression by RNAi (interference ribonucleic acid) \n\ncould also be an approach to be used in future works, in an attempt to investigate \n\nthe involvement of this protein in the uptake of the PSs BCa cells. \n\n  \n\n\n\nConclusion and future perspectives \n\n \n\n66 \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER IV \n\n     METHODS AND MATERIALS \n\n      \n\n  \n\n\n\nMethods and Materials \n\n \n\n68 \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nMethods and Materials \n\n \n\n69 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPart 1 \n\nSynthesis of galacto-phthalocyanines \n\n  \n\n\n\nMethods and Materials \n\n \n\n70 \n\n \n\n1.

P-value was considered at the 5% level of significance to deduce \n\ninference of the significance of the data. \n\n \n\n3.2 Experimental procedures \n\n \n\n3.2.1 Cell culture and subculture \n\n \n\n UM-UC-3 cells were grown in RPMI medium. After two to three days, \n\nconfluent cells were subcultured. The medium was removed from culture flasks by \n\naspiration and discarded. The cell layers were washed with 10 mL of pre-warmed \n\nsterile PBS, in order to remove traces of FBS that would inhibit the action of the \n\ntrypsin. After that, the cells were treated with 2.5 mL of trypsin Tryple Express and \n\nincubated during 5 min at 37 \u00baC until the cells rounded up and the cell layer start to \n\ndisperse. The trypsinization progress was monitored under an inverted microscope. \n\nAfter incubation, RPMI medium was added to inhibit further tryptic activity and the \n\ncells were dispersed by repeated pippeting over the monolayer surface. The cells \n\nsuspensions were then centrifuged at 1,000 x g for 5 min. The supernatant was \n\nremoved, the cells were re-suspended in RPMI medium and appropriate aliquots of \n\ncells were added to new 75 cm2 culture flasks. Cells were examined carefully every \n\n\n\nMethods and Materials \n\n \n\n87 \n\n \n\nday by eye on an inverted microscope, for signs of contamination and the RPMI \n\nmedium was changed two or three times per week (118). \n\n \n\n3.2.2 Preparation and treatment of UM-UC-3 cells with photosensitizers  \n\n \n\nAfter the removal of supernatant and the re-suspension of the cells in 10 mL \n\nof RPMI medium as described before, 20 \u00b5L of cell suspension was mixed with 20 \n\n\u00b5L of trypan blue stain to determine cellular viability. Trypan Blue is an organic \n\namine dye that is excluded by living cells with intact membranes, while death cells, \n\nwhere the plasma membrane integrity is compromised, take up the dye. Thus, all \n\nthe cells that are blushed with the dye are considered non-viable and appear with a \n\nblue color in the microscope. On the other hand, viable cells will appear brilliant. \n\nCells were counted using a haemocytometer. The percentage of viable cells and the \n\nconcentration of cells per milliliter of cell suspension were calculated according to \n\nthe following equations: \n\n \n\n?????? ????? (%) =\n?\u00ba ?? ?????? ?????\n\n?\u00ba  ?? ????? ?????\n \u00d7 100 \n\n \n\n?????? ?????\n\n??\n=\n\n??? \u00d7 ???????? ??????\n\n1 \u00d7 10?4\n \n\n \n\nOnly cells with viability superior to 90% were utilized in the experiments. The viable \n\ncells concentration was calculated considering the average of viable cells (VCs) per \n\neach counting square, the dilution made and the volume of each counting square. \n\nAfter this, UM-UC-3 cells were seeded into cell culture plates of 24 or 96-\n\nwells according to the experiment, at a density of 18 x 104 and 3 x 104 cells.cm-2 \n\nrespectively, and incubated overnight in an incubator at 37 \u00baC with 5% CO2 and 95% \n\nair to promote cell adhesion. On the following day, the UM-UC-3 cells growing in \n\nmonolayer culture were treated with desired concentrations of sterile solutions of \n\nPSs.  \n\n\n\nMethods and Materials \n\n \n\n88 \n\n \n\nStock solutions of the PSs at a concentration of 330 \u00b5M were prepared in \n\nsterile DMSO and stored at 0-4 \u00baC in dark conditions. Freshly working solutions with \n\ndifferent concentrations were obtained from the respective stock solution in sterile \n\nPBS, accounting their water solubility range. The concentration of DMSO was \n\nalways lower than 0.5% (v/v), in all working solutions. \n\n \n\n3.2.3 Determination of intracellular PS concentration by fluorimetry \n\n \n\nTaking into account the fluorescence properties of the Pcs, their \n\nconcentration inside the cancer cells can be determined by fluorimetry (after cell \n\nlysis) and normalized to total protein quantity. The protein quantification was \n\nmeasured spectrophotometrically using the Bicinchoninic Acid Assay (BCA assay), \n\nalso known as the Smith assay (123). The procedure involves two fundamental \n\nsteps: 1) biuret reaction, where the cupric ion (Cu2+) is reduced to cuprous ion (Cu+) \n\nby peptide bonds in proteins, in an alkaline environment, resulting in a blue color, \n\nand therefore, the amount of reduced Cu2+ is proportional to the amount of protein \n\npresent in the solution; 2) the chelation of two molecules of BCA with one cuprous \n\nion results in an intense purple-colored product that can be measure at any \n\nwavelength between 550 nm and 570 nm. \n\n \n\nA. Determination of intracellular PS fluorescence \n\n \n\nUM-UC-3 cells were seeded into 96-wells cell culture plates at a density of 3 \n\nx 104 cells per well (final volume of 100 \u00b5L per well) and incubated overnight in an \n\nincubator at 37 \u00baC with 5% CO2 and 95% air. On the following day, immediately after \n\nPSs incubation, cells were washed twice with PBS. Then, they were mechanically \n\nscrapped in 120 \u00b5L of 1% (m/v) SDS solution in PBS (pH 7.0) and the plate was \n\nstirred on an automatic plate shaker in the dark at rt. 90 \u00b5L of this cell suspension \n\nwere transferred to 96-wells black plates and the intracellular fluorescence of the \n\nPSs was determined by fluorometric measurement, using standard PSs solutions (0 \n\n\u2013 6.25 \u00b5M) for calibration (Figure 4.1). The intracellular fluorescence was \n\ndetermined using a Typhoon FLA 9000 imager (GE Healthcare) with a 100-\u00b5m spot \n\n\n\nMethods and Materials \n\n \n\n89 \n\n \n\nresolution and 300 V. The excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 635 nm \n\n(red LD laser) and LPR (665LP), respectively. The PS concentration in the samples \n\nwas directly obtained by plotting the average of the fluorescence for each PS \n\nstandard in function of its concentration (\u00b5M). The results were normalized for \n\nprotein concentration.  \n\n \n\n0 2 4 6\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n\n6000\n\n8000 Volume=1340[]\n\nr\n2\n=0.9946\n\nA\n\nConcentration (?M)\n\nV\no\n\nlu\nm\n\ne\n\n0 2 4 6\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\nVolume=12300[]\n\nr\n2\n=0.9963\n\nB\n\nConcentration (?M)\n\nV\no\n\nlu\nm\n\ne\n\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4\n0\n\n1000000\n\n2000000\n\n3000000\nVolume = 7835000[]\n\nr\n2\n = 0,9774\n\nC\n\nConcentration (?M)\n\nV\no\n\nlu\nm\n\ne\n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 Calibration slopes of the PSs (SiPcGal4 (A), SiPcGal2 (B) and SiPc(OH)2 (C)) \n\nfluorescence average in function of their standard concentrations (0 - 6.25 \u00b5M). \n\n \n\nB. Determination of protein concentration \n\n \n\nIn a 96-wells plate, the following solutions were pipetted into each well: \n\n- 25 \u00b5L of sample buffer: 1% (m/v) SDS in PBS (pH 7.0), \n\n- 25 \u00b5L of sample, blank (sample buffer), standard (prepared in the sample \n\nbuffer at concentrations ranging from 12.5-800 \u00b5g.mL-1 using the BSA standard at 2 \n\nmg.mL-1), \n\n- 150 \u00b5L of BCA working Reagent (50 parts of BCA reagent A mixed with one \n\npart of BCA reagent B). \n\nThe plate was incubated at 37 \u00baC for 30 min. Then, the absorbance at 570 \n\nnm was measured in the plate reader spectrophotometer. The protein concentration \n\n\n\nMethods and Materials \n\n \n\n90 \n\n \n\nin the samples was directly obtained by plotting the average of the absorbance at \n\n570 nm for each BSA standard in function of its concentration (\u00b5g.mL-1). \n\n \n\n3.2.4 Determination of intracellular PS fluorescence by fluorescence \n\nmicroscopy \n\n \n\nKnowing the fluorescence properties of Pcs, their intracellular fluorescence \n\ncan also be evaluated by fluorescence microscopy. Coverslips (one per well in 24-\n\nwells culture plates) were coated with poly-L-lysine for 1 h at rt. Then, after drying \n\ncompletely the UM-UC-3 were plated at a density of 18 x 104 cells per well (200 \u00b5L \n\nper well), in 24-wells culture plates for 3 h before treatment. After PS uptake and \n\nwashing, cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min at rt. The samples were washed \n\nwith PBS (2 x 5 min). The coverslips were mounted using Vectashield sealed with \n\nnail polish and stored at 4 \u00baC until visualization under the fluorescence microscope. \n\n \n\n3.2.5 Photodynamic Assays \n\n \n\nThe desired effect that is expected to obtain after photo-activation of PS is \n\nnot only its preferential accumulation in cancer cells, but also its toxicity only upon \n\nlight irradiation. That is why it is important to study the PSs toxicity in the absence \n\nand presence of light irradiation. \n\nAfter PSs incubation, cells were washed with PBS and then it was added 100 \n\n\u00b5L of RPMI medium to cover the cells. In a dark room, cells were irradiated during \n\n40 min with red light at a potency of 2.5 mW.cm-2. After irradiation, cells were \n\nincubated in the humidified incubator gassed with 5% CO2 and 95% air. \n\n \n\n3.2.6 Cell viability assay \n\n \n\nTo evaluate the toxicity and phototoxicity of the PSs the MTT assay was \n\nused. In living cells, MTT is reduced by the mitochondrial enzyme succinate \n\ndehydrogenase to the insoluble blue purple formazan crystals, which means that it \n\n\n\nMethods and Materials \n\n \n\n91 \n\n \n\nis possible to correlate the reduction of MTT with this enzyme activity and therefore \n\nwith the cellular viability (124). \n\nUM-UC-3 cells were plated before at a density of 3 x 104 cells per well, in 96-\n\nwells culture plates for 24 h before treatment and then were treated with the PSs. \n\nThe photodynamic treatment was performed and after 24 h, 50 \u00b5L of the medium \n\nwas removed and 10 \u00b5L of MTT stock solution (3 mg.mL-1 in PBS buffer) was added \n\nto each well in order to obtain a final concentration of 0.5 mg.mL-1. The plates were \n\nthen incubated at 37 \u00baC with 5% CO2 and 95% air for 3 h. After that, the formed \n\npurple crystals were dissolved by the addition of 150 \u00b5L of acidic isopropanol (0.04 \n\nM HCl in absolute isopropanol), with repeated pipetting. The absorbance was \n\nmeasured at 570 nm (using 620 nm as the background wavelength), using a plate \n\nreader spectrophotometer: Absorbance 570 nm \u2013 Absorbance 620 nm. The \n\npercentage of absorbance for each treated sample was normalized to each \n\nuntreated control cells (cells incubated with only PBS): \n\n \n\n??? ????????? (%) =  \n??? (??????? ???????)\n\n??? (????????? ???????)\n\u00d7 100 \n\n \n\n3.2.7 Intracellular levels of Reactive Oxygen Species after PDT \n\n \n\nThe ROS generation after PDT were detected using three different probes: \n\nH2DCFDA (118), DHE (119) and MitoPy1 (120), by fluorescence spectroscopy \n\ntechnique. H2DCFDA is able to cross the cell membrane and intracellular esterases \n\nremove its acetate groups, producing H2DCF that will react with several cytotoxic \n\nROS and form DCF which fluorescence intensity can be measured and be directly \n\ncorrelated with the intracellular ROS levels. DHE probe has blue fluorescence and \n\nit diffuses across cell membrane. O2\u00b7? anions oxidize DHE to ethidium, which \n\nintercalates within the cell\u2019s DNA, staining the nucleus with bright red fluorescence. \n\nMitoPy1 probe selectively tracks to the mitochondria and responds to local fluxes of \n\nH2O2 with a turn-on fluorescence increase. \n\n UM-UC-3 cells were plated in 96-wells black plates for 24 h before treatment. \n\nAfter photodynamic treatment and washing, cells were incubated with 5 \u00b5M of the \n\n\n\nMethods and Materials \n\n \n\n92 \n\n \n\nthree probes, under dark conditions, for 1 h at 37\u00baC. After incubation, cells were \n\nwashed with PBS and mechanically scrapped in 1% (m/v) SDS solution in PBS (pH \n\n7.0). Then, the intracellular fluorescence was measured with excitation and \n\nemission filters of 485/20 and 590/35 nm for H2DCFDA, 485/20 and 528/20 nm for \n\nDHE and MitoPy1. Protein concentration was determined using the Pierce\u00ae BCA \n\nProtein Assay Kit as described previously. \n\n\n\n \n\n93 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER V \n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY \n\n         \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nBibliography \n\n \n\n94 \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nBibliography \n\n \n\n95 \n\n \n\nV.
