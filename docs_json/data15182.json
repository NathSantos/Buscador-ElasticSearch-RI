Also, the Sergipe State peat samples were compared with\nother peat sample from later from Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The lowest O/C and E\n\n4\n/E\n\n6\n ratios and\n\ndifferential thermal analysis (DTA) curves of the Santo Amaro (SAO) sample indicated that this\nsample had the highest degree of decomposition. FTIR results showed that Itabaiana (ITA) and S\u00e3o\nPaulo (SAP) samples presented more prominent peak at 1086 cm-1 attributed the presence of Si-O\nthan SAO sample spectra. The SAO sample showed two more intense peaks at 2920 cm-1 and 2850\ncm-1. These results were corroborated by 13C NMR and thermal gravimetric (TG) where the relative\nabundance of the alkyl-C groups was greater in the SAO sample. The X-ray diffractometry (XRD)\nof SAO sample is characteristic of amorphous matter however, the SAP and ITA samples revealed\nthe large presence of quartz mineral. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and environmental\nscanning electron microscopy (ESEM) showed that the surface of peat samples have porous granules\nof organic material. The ITA and SAP peat samples are alike while SAO peat sample is richer in\norganic material. Only the SAO sample has truthful characteristics of peat. The results of this study\nshowed that the samples are very different due to variable inorganic and organic material contents.\n\nKeywords: peat structure and properties,spectroscopy and microscopy characterization,\nscanning electron microscopy, environmental scanning electron microscopy\n\n\n\n715Rom\u00e3o et al.Vol. 18, No. 4, 2007\n\nIntroduction\n\nPeat is formed primarily from inhibited decomposition\nof various plant materials in the waterlogged environment\nof marshes, bogs and swamps. 1,2 Natural peats,\ncontinuously formed by complex humification processes\nfrom plant residues, are important reservoirs of refractory\norganic carbon in aquatic environments. Due to their high\ncontent of humic substances, natural peats exhibit\nfavourable chemical-physical properties enabling their\nuseful application in various technical areas, for instance\nwastewater treatment, pollution monitoring, fuel\nproduction, in soil fertilizing, as well as, in veterinary\nand human medicine. Previous work has established that\nthe ability of humic substances to bind heavy metal ions\ncan be attributed to their high content of oxygen-\ncontaining functional groups, including carboxyl, phenol,\nhydroxyl, enol and carbonyl structures of various types.3-\n6 Humic substances are classified according to their\nsolubility in water as humic acids, fulvic acids and humin.\nThe last is the fraction with the highest molecular weight\nand highest carbon content of the three humic fractions.\nIn addition, humin is extremely porous and, as a\nconsequence, the surface area is very large. The\navailability of pores and internal surface are useful in the\nadsorption process.7 Clay mineral constituents, such as\nkaolinite and montmorillonite, are also found in peat\nsamples, and contribute to the high adsorption capacity\nattributed to net negative charge on the structure of silicate\nminerals. This negative charge is neutralized by the\nadsorption of positively charged species, such as heavy\nmetals.5 Thus, organic-rich and mineral-rich peat samples\ncan be different in their binding capacity for metals (e.g.\nchromium).\n\nThe need for controlling heavy metals emissions into\nthe environment is even more pronounced due to\nexponentially increasing human populations, which can\nbe exposed once the metallic species enter the ecosystem.\nNowadays, under the public and media pressure,\ngovernments introduce and progressively enforce stricter\nregulations with regard to metal discharges particularly\nfor industrial operations.8\n\nFor this reason, increased attention is being focused\non effective and inexpensive technologies capable of\ntreating large quantities of wastewater. The advantage of\nbiosorption lies in using biomass raw materials (e.g. peat)\nwhich are easily available and can be selective particularly\nto heavy metals. The last aspect is important and may be\nachieved by manipulating the properties or characteristics\nof a biosorbent. Besides, subsequent desorption for\nrecovery/reuse of metals as well as regeneration/reuse of\n\nthe biosorbent are crucially important for keeping the\nprocess costs down and to prevent creation of secondary\nproblems with metal-bearing sludges which are extremely\ndifficult for disposal. These concepts are considered in\nprinciples of green chemistry which underpin this kind of\nresearch.8-10\n\nDue to their extreme heterogeneity and natural variety,\nchemical attributes of peat can vary widely among\ndifferent peat deposits, and the characterization of isolated\npeat samples and their manifold effects is still a\nchallenging task in environmental analytical chemistry\nrequiring efficient combinations of powerful chemical and\nspectroscopic methodologies.\n\nIn the present paper we have applied a new multi-\nmethod approach, consisting of elemental and thermal\nanalyses, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), solid state\n13C nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR), scanning\nelectron microscopy (SEM), environmental scanning\nelectron microscopy (ESEM) and X-ray diffractometry\n(XRD), to study the structure and properties of typical\nBrazilian peat samples. Such a multimethod concept is\nan important prerequisite for a reliable assessment of\nbeneficial peat effects in the environment. Chromium\nsorption onto different peat fractions will be reported in a\nforthcoming paper.\n\nExperimental\n\nPeat samples\n\nThree peat samples have been collected from two\ndifferent regions of Sergipe State, Brazil, Itabaiana (ITA)\nand Santo Amaro (SAO), and one from Sao Paulo (SAP)\nState, Brazil. The raw peat was dried in an oven at 100 \u00b0C\nfor 24 h and then sieved though a 9 mesh sieve and\nanalysed without further treatment.\n\nDry ash, H/C, O/C and E\n4\n/E\n\n6\n\nA Perkin Elmer 1110 elemental analyzer determined\nthe elemental composition of peat samples. The proportion\nof dry ash was obtained after ignition at 750\u00b0C for 4 h.11\n\nE\n4\n/E\n\n6\n ratios were determined by dissolving 2.0 mg of peat\n\nin 10 mL of 0.05 mol L-1 NaHCO\n3\n solution (pH 9.0 in all\n\ncases)12 and by measuring optical densities at 465 and\n665 nm on a Hitachi U 2000 spectrophotometer.\n\nInfrared spectroscopy\n\nThe peat samples (0.035 g each) were mixed with 0.35\ng of KBr (spectroscopic grade) at the biomass/KBr ratio\n\n\n\n716 Structure and Properties of Brazilian Peat: Analysis by Spectroscopy and Microscopy J. Braz. Chem. Soc.\n\n1:10. The mixtures were then pressed into pellets for FTIR\nanalysis. The spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 730 SX-\nFT spectrometer on a spectral range of 4000-400 cm-1.\n\nSolid state 13C NMR spectroscopy\n\nThe samples (120 a 150 mg) were crushed and ground\ninto powder prior to analysis. Spectra were recorded on a\nVarian INOVA-300 spectrometer working at 75.4 MHz (13C).\n13C spectra were recorded with a spinning frequency of 3000\nHz, a 90\u00b0 pulse and acquisition time of 6 s. The reference at\n0 ppm was SiMe\n\n4\n. Chemical shifts were assigned according\n\nto Swift (1996):13 alkyl-C from 0 to 65 ppm; O-alkyl-C from\n65 to 110 ppm; aromatic-C from 110 to 140 ppm; phenolic-\nC from 140 to 160 ppm; carboxylic-C from 160 to 190 ppm\nand carbonyl-C from 190 to 220 ppm.\n\nThermal analyses\n\nFor DTA and (TG) analysis, about 8 mg of peat\nsamples were ground with a mortar and pestle and sieved\nthrough a 70 mesh sieve to homogenize them. After the\nsamples were heated continuously from 40 to 1000 \u00b0C\nat a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min-1 in an atmosphere of\nsynthetic air (99.999%, 20% O\n\n2\n and 80% N\n\n2\n) (100 mL\n\nmin-1) and in an alumina crucible. In the differential\nthermal analysis the temperature difference between\nsample and inert reference material (?-alumina) was\nmeasured. DTA and TG curves were recorded simul-\ntaneously using TA Instruments SDT-2960. The thermal\nanalyses were done in duplicate with a standard deviation\nof 0.1%.\n\nX-ray diffractometer\n\nDetailed mineralogical studies of peat samples were\ncarried out using a X-ray diffraction (SIEMENS D-5000)\nwith CuK?, step time 1 s, step size 0.05 dg and wave\nlength 1.54 \u00c5.\n\nScanning Electron Microscopy\n\nMeasurements were performed using a JSM T330A\nSEM in ultra high vaccum. Peat samples were placed onto\n\nclean electron microscopy support stubs, coated with gold\nin an Emscope SC 500 sputter coater.\n\nEnvironmental Scanning Electron Microscopy\n\nAll measurements were carried out in a FEI XL-30\nFEG-ESEM in wet mode, fitted with a water cooled Peltier\nstage fitted. All images were obtained at 2 \u00b0C and the\npressure altered below 10 Torr to maintain humidities\nbetween 25 and 100%. Samples were imaged with a\ngaseous secondary electron detector using 10 kV electron\nbeam and using H\n\n2\nO for the vapour skirt.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nThe elemental analyses, elemental ratios, dry ash and\nratios E\n\n4\n/E\n\n6\n are listed in Table 1. The decomposition of\n\norganic material present in the peat samples tends to lead\nto the formation of phenolic structures derived from lignin.\nIt is harder for these structures to suffer degradation\ncompared with sugars and proteins.11 The H/C and O/C\nratios are indicators for the percentage saturation of the C\natoms within the organic molecule and of the carbohydrate\ncontent respectively. Lower H/C ratios indicate higher\naromaticity in the samples. There are similarities between\nthe H/C ratios of the samples and the values in the\nliterature, indicating considerable aromaticity.14 The\nlowest O/C ratio of the SAO sample indicates the lowest\ncarbohydrate level and/or the highest organic content of\nthat peat sample.15\n\nThe measure of E\n4 \n/E\n\n6\n ratio is a simple spectroscopic\n\nproperty which has been used to characterize the progress\nof decomposition.12 This ratio has been correlated\nnegatively with increasing content of condensed aromatic\nstructures.16\n\nAll together, the results indicate that the SAO peat is\nhighly humified and rich in organics, while the other two\npeats contain less organic matter of different composition.\n\nFigure 1 shows the infrared spectra of the different\npeat samples. The spectra characteristics are broad bands\ntypical of natural organic matter due to superposition of\nindividual absorptions bands.17 The most consistent\nfeatures of these spectra are: a) a broad band around 3400\ncm-1 due to O-H stretching of various groups like phenols\n\nTable 1.

In addition the SAO spectra\ncontained two more prominent peaks at 2920 cm-1 and\n2850 cm-1. Most likely, these peaks are due to stretching\nC-H due to C alkyl and are much less pronounced in the\nless organic ITA and SAP samples.\n\nThe chemical shifts assignments of 13C-NMR spectra\nand their relative abundance obtained are given in Table 2.\n\nAll three peat samples are highly aromaticity and slow\nsimilarities with the literature data for coal humic acid\n(HA).18 In addition, Gondar et al.19 has shown that alkyl-\nC were the dominant C components in peat humic acids\n(HA) and fulvic acids (FA). In particular, the FA contains\nmore alkyl-C and carboxylic carbon but less O-alkyl-C\nand aromatic-C than the corresponding HA. The\nabundance of alkyl-C groups was greater in the SAO\nsample than others and this is consistent with the results\nfrom the FTIR analysis. The results of ITA and SAP\nsamples showed similarities each other and were different\nwhen compared with SAO sample.\n\nThe DTA curves are given in Figure. 2 and indicate\nexothermic reactions in all samples, due to the oxidation\nof organic matter. In a TG analysis the mass of a sample in\na controlled atmosphere is recorded continously as a\nfunction of temperature or time as the temperature of the\nsample is increased. The SAO sample shows an endothermic\npeak near to 100 \u00b0C accompanied by weight loss of 5% of\ndehydration of sample (Figure 3). This sample shows higher\nexothermic effect between 300-400 \u00b0C and 500 \u00b0C. This\nindicated that SAO has higher organic matter and these\nresults are corroborated with the dry ash, O/C and E\n\n4\n/E\n\n6\n\nratios and FTIR. According to Leinweber and Schulten,20\n\nthe exothermic effect in this temperature range can be more\npronounced with greater peat formation time.\n\nThe weight loss curves in Figure 3 shows that the\ndecomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) increases at\n300 \u00b0C and is largely completed before 600 \u00b0C. The weight\nloss of the peat samples in different range of temperature\nare shown in the Table 3. In that range of temperature the\nhigher variation of weight occured to the SAO sample\n(9.93%), while in the others the variation was almost 2%\nprobably, due to greater organic matter content of that\nsample. Tikhova et al.21 have shown that exothermic\nreaction in the range of 280-320 \u00b0C corresponds to the\nthermal decomposition of aliphatic chain and carboxyl\ngroups attached to it. This indicates higher presence of\nalkyl groups in that SAO sample and this is corroborated\nwith the results from 13C NMR.\n\nTable 2.

Braz. Chem. Soc.\n\nDetailed examination of the mineralogy of the peat\nsamples using XRD is shown in the Figure 4. The XRD\nof SAO sample (Figure 4a1) is characteristic of\namorphous matter with a hump, between 18\u00b0 and 32\u00b0.\nBozkurt et al.15 analyzing the processes involved in peat\nformation, recognized an anaerobic thick structural layer,\nwhich is formed of residual material from the original\nplant structure, decay products and new substances\nproduced mainly by bacteria. At this level peat would\nbe amorphous and highly humified. However, only the\nXRD of dry ash or residue of that sample revealed\n\nmineral characteristics with presence of quartz mineral\nand some clay material. These materials were recovered\nby the organic matter of peat (Figure 4a2). The XRD of\nSAP and ITA samples revealed the large presence of\nquartz mineral (Figure 4b and 4c). This feature is more\nrelated with mineral characteristic of those samples,\nwhich were observed in the FTIR spectra and the higher\nresults of dry ash in that samples.\n\nSEM and ESEM are shown in Figures 5 and 6,\nrespectively. There are similarities between the two\ntechniques, SEM and ESEM of the samples have shown\nthat the surface of peat samples have porous granules of\norganic material. Therefore, there are differences between\nthem. SEM images are more densely packed due to drying\nprocess and an ultra high vacuum (Figure 5). ESEM is a\n\nTable 3.
