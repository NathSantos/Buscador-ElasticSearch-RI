For that were conducted detailed environmental \n\nmagnetic analyses along three sedimentary columns (C02, C05 and C07) with 2.5 to 3.0 m of length.  \n\nThese analyses comprehended measurements of magnetic susceptibility, anhysteretic and isothermal \n\nremanent magnetizations and hysteresis loops. Low coercivity ferrimagnetic carriers, magnetite and/or \n\nmaghemite, appear as the main magnetic carriers. Additionally and particularly in core C07, a \n\nsignificant contribution of high coercivity minerals is also retrieved at some sedimentary depths, must \n\nprobably corresponding to an enrichment of hematite and/or goethite. Along the cores C02 and C07, \n\ncoherent transitions between stable and rather variable intervals of magnetic susceptibility and grain \n\nsize are well defined, revealing different environmental conditions.  \n\nSpectral analyses of magnetic parameters sensitive to the concentration and granulometry of main \n\nferromagnetic carriers identified periodicities that are closely related to the Milankovitch orbital cycles \n\nwhen assumed sedimentation rates of 1 cm/kyr and 1.6 cm/kyr, for cores C02 (mostly) and C07, \n\nrespectively. According to these sedimentation rates there is no close link between the variable/stable \n\nvalues of ? and grain size and the glacial/interglacial periods. \n\nIn both cores maxima of magnetic susceptibility and coarser magnetic carriers suggest the presence of \n\nice-rafted debris (IRD) transported by icebergs during the Heinrich events, however complementary \n\nstudies are necessary to confirm it. For the remaining core C05, low and quite stable values of magnetic \n\nsusceptibility as well the absence the well defined intervals and \n14\n\nC ages indicate that the core \n\ncorrespond to landslide. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKey-words: Environmental magnetism; Atlantic Ocean Seamounts; climate changes;                   \nGlacial-Interglacial Periods; ice-rafted debris (IRD) \n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nResumo  \n\n \n\nAo longo dos \u00faltimos milh\u00f5es de anos, o clima tem oscilado entre per\u00edodos glaciares e interglaciares \n\nimpulsionado por varia\u00e7\u00f5es orbitais da Terra e modulado por mecanismos de feedback.  \n\nDados paleoclim\u00e1ticos sugerem que os per\u00edodos interglaciares come\u00e7aram e acabaram de forma s\u00fabita, \n\nao passo que os per\u00edodos glaciares ter\u00e3o resultado de uma s\u00e9rie de eventos de arrefecimento menores, \n\nque culminaram nos per\u00edodos glaciares. \n\nApesar da escassez de informa\u00e7\u00f5es para per\u00edodos anteriores a 300 mil anos, sabe-se que, ao contr\u00e1rio \n\ndos per\u00edodos interglaciares, que s\u00e3o caracterizados por condi\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas relativamente est\u00e1veis, os \n\nper\u00edodos glaciares s\u00e3o marcados por mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas abruptas. \n\nO \u00faltimo per\u00edodo interglaciar, tamb\u00e9m chamado Eemiano, ter-se-\u00e1 estendido desde aproximadamente h\u00e1 \n\n130-140 mil at\u00e9 acerca de 110 mil anos. Durante este per\u00edodo, o clima da Terra assemelhar-se-ia em \n\nmuito ao atual, sendo no entanto ligeiramente mais quente. No final deste ciclo, originou-se um per\u00edodo \n\nglacial que se estendeu at\u00e9 aproximadamente h\u00e1 10 mil anos. Este \u00faltimo per\u00edodo glaciar foi marcado \n\nacentuadamente por flutua\u00e7\u00f5es r\u00e1pidas e de curta dura\u00e7\u00e3o, em que o clima variou entre per\u00edodos \n\nextremamente frios e outros mais quentes, conhecidos como eventos de Dansgaard-Oeschger.  \n\nAssociados a estes, ocorreram tamb\u00e9m os eventos de Heinrich, que corresponderam a enormes \n\ndescargas de icebergs no oceano Atl\u00e2ntico provenientes dos glaciares que cobriam a Am\u00e9rica do Norte \n\n(Laurentide Ice Sheet-LIS) e o Norte da Europa (Fennoscandinavian Ice Sheet). A ocorr\u00eancia dos \n\neventos de Heinrich encontra-se vastamente descrita na literatura, tendo sido atribu\u00edda a ocorr\u00eancia \n\ndestes eventos a cada 7-13 mil anos.  \n\nEstes fen\u00f3menos extremos tiveram importantes consequ\u00eancias no clima, um pouco por todo o mundo e \n\nalteraram profundamente a circula\u00e7\u00e3o oce\u00e2nica global, havendo estudos que mostram a interrup\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nforma\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00c1gua Profunda do Atl\u00e2ntico Norte (NADW) e da corrente termohalina. \n\nAtualmente ainda n\u00e3o existe consenso sobre o que ter\u00e1 originado os eventos de Heinrich, mas o modelo \n\nmais aceite estabelece que durante o \u00faltimo per\u00edodo glaciar as camadas de gelo teriam crescido \n\npromovidas pelas baixas temperaturas, estando ent\u00e3o assentes em solos congelados. No entanto, a partir \n\nde uma certa espessura de gelo ter-se-ia come\u00e7ado a gerar calor na base do glaciar, o qual teria \n\ncontribu\u00eddo para sua destabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o, resultando assim nos eventos de Heinrich.    \n\nAs camadas de sedimentos depositadas no fundo oce\u00e2nico durante estes fen\u00f3menos, chamadas de \n\n\u201cHeinrich layers\u201d, foram inicialmente identificadas em sedimentos marinhos entre as latitudes de 45\u00ba e \n\n50\u00baN, mas desde ent\u00e3o t\u00eam sido encontradas um pouco por todo o Atl\u00e2ntico Norte at\u00e9 \u00e0 latitude de \n\n37\u00baN, e distribu\u00eddas em longitude desde a Am\u00e9rica do Norte at\u00e9 \u00e0 Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica. \n\nAs \u201cHeinrich layers\u201d s\u00e3o identific\u00e1veis pela sua abund\u00e2ncia em ice-rafted debris (IRD) e carbonatos \n\ndetr\u00edticos, m\u00ednimos de abund\u00e2ncia de foramin\u00edferos e picos de Neogloboquadrina pachyderma \n\n(sinistral). O estudo das suas propriedades magn\u00e9ticas revelou aumentos da susceptibilidade magn\u00e9tica, \n\ndenotando assim aumentos da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de minerais ferromagn\u00e9ticos, bem como da sua \n\ngranulometria. A mineralogia \u00e9 essencialmente composta por (titano)magnetites, que se cr\u00ea terem sido \n\noriginadas em rochas vulc\u00e2nicas presentes na zona de capta\u00e7\u00e3o de sedimentos da LIS. \n\nO estudo de propriedades magn\u00e9ticas de sedimentos tem-se revelado extremamente muito \u00fatil n\u00e3o s\u00f3 na \n\nidentifica\u00e7\u00e3o das \u201cHeinrich layers\u201d, mas principalmente aplicado ao estudo de mudan\u00e7as ambientais, \n\nembora se trate ainda de uma \u00e1rea relativamente recente. O princ\u00edpio b\u00e1sico da utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o dos m\u00e9todos \n\nmagn\u00e9ticos aplicado ao estudo das mudan\u00e7as ambientais (tais como o clima), baseia-se no facto destas \n\ninfluenciarem o tipo e modo de transporte e deposi\u00e7\u00e3o dos sedimentos, bem como rea\u00e7\u00f5es diagen\u00e9ticas. \n\nDesta forma, a partir de medi\u00e7\u00f5es de susceptibilidade magn\u00e9tica, magnetiza\u00e7\u00f5es anhister\u00e9tica e \n\nisot\u00e9rmica e dos par\u00e2metros obtidos a partir das curvas de hysteresis \u00e9 poss\u00edvel aceder a informa\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ncomo a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o, granulometria e tipo de portadores magn\u00e9ticos presentes nos sedimentos e, desta \n\nforma inferir varia\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais.  \n\nAssim, e de forma a avaliar as mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas ocorridas no Oceano Atl\u00e2ntico ao longo dos \n\n\u00faltimos milhares de anos, detalhadas an\u00e1lises magn\u00e9ticas foram conduzidas em tr\u00eas colunas \n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\nsedimentares (C02, C05 e C07) localizadas maioritariamente em montanhas submarinas entre as \n\nlatitudes de 29\u00baN e 35\u00baN.  \n\nEstas an\u00e1lises compreenderam medi\u00e7\u00f5es de susceptibilidade magn\u00e9tica, magnetiza\u00e7\u00e3o remanescente \n\nanhister\u00e9tica e isot\u00e9rmica e curvas de histereses. \n\nOs principais portadores magn\u00e9ticos correspondem a minerais ferrimagn\u00e9ticos de baixa coercividade, \n\ncomo magnetite e/ou maghemite. Al\u00e9m disso, e particularmente no core C07, uma contribui\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nsignificativa de minerais de alta coercividade s\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m encontrados a certas profundidades, devendo-\n\nse provavelmente a um enriquecimento em hematite e/ou goethite. \n\nA sedimentologia do core C07 mostra que este \u00e9 muito heterog\u00e9neo, sendo constitu\u00eddo por argilas, siltes \n\ne areias. O conte\u00fado de argila e de areia encontra-se em oposi\u00e7\u00e3o de fase e variam entre 6-38% e 8-\n\n66%, respectivamente. O conte\u00fado de areia acompanha o comportamento da granulometria m\u00e9dia dos \n\nsedimentos. \n\nAn\u00e1lises espectrais de par\u00e2metros magn\u00e9ticos sens\u00edveis \u00e0 concentra\u00e7\u00e3o e granulometria dos minerais \n\nferromagn\u00e9ticos mostram periodicidades estritamente ligadas aos ciclos orbitais de Milankovitch, \n\nquando se assumem taxas de sedimenta\u00e7\u00e3o de 1 cm/kyr e 1.6 cm/kyr, para os cores C02 e C07, \n\nrespectivamente. \n\nEm ambos os cores, valores m\u00e1ximos de susceptibilidade magn\u00e9tica e portadores magn\u00e9ticos grosseiros \n\nsugerem a presen\u00e7a de ice-rafted debris (IRD) transportados pelos icebergs durante os eventos de \n\nHeinrich, por\u00e9m mais estudos como estratigrafia isot\u00f3pica e composi\u00e7\u00e3o isot\u00f3pica de Ca/Sr e Sr-Nd \n\nsejam necess\u00e1rios para o confirmar. \n\nO outro core, C05 apresenta valores de susceptibilidade muito baixos e bastante est\u00e1veis bem como a \n\naus\u00eancia de intervalos bem definidos e idades de \n14\n\nC indicam que o core dever\u00e1 corresponder a um \n\ndeslizamento de terras. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Magnetismo ambiental; Montanhas submarinas do Atl\u00e2ntico Norte; altera\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nclim\u00e1ticas; Per\u00edodos Glaciares-Interglaciares; ice-rafted debris (IRD) \n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\nContents \n \n\n1.

Introduction \n\nOver the past million years, climate has changed between glacial and interglacial states driven by the \n\nEarth's orbital variations and modulated by feedback mechanisms. Superimposed on this glacial-\n\ninterglacial trend abrupt climate changes at a millennial time-scale occurred in the last glacial cycle: \n\nDansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) warming and cooling events (Dansgaard et al., 1992) and Heinrich events \n\n(HE) (Heinrich, 1988; Bond et al., 1992). Although rapid climate changes were identified during \n\ninterglacials, they were less prominent than during glacial periods. However, only sporadic information \n\nis available for the instabilities punctuating the interglacial climate optima of the last 300 kyr, prior to \n\nthe quite well documented present interglacial, the Holocene. \n\nDespite the large number of studies conducted in order to understand the climate evolution and its \n\ncauses, particularly during the last glacial period, our knowledge of what may have happened and how \n\nis still poor.  \n\nOne particular case is the Heinrich events that happened during the coldest periods of the Dansgaard-\n\nOeschger events, in six short phases approximately between 13 kyr and 70 kyr ago.  \n\nThese events corresponded to large icebergs discharges into the northern Atlantic Ocean from the \n\nLaurentide and northern European ice sheets (Bond et al., 1992; Broecker et al., 1992). They caused \n\nsevere changes in surface and deep-water currents (e.g. Bond et al., 1993; Cortijo et al., 1997; Kissel et \n\nal., 1998; Chapman et al., 2000) and in the worldwide climate (e.g. Grimm et al.,  1993; Arz et al, \n\n1998; Leuschner et al., 2000; Naughton et al., 2009). These extreme discharges episodes have been \n\nfirstly documented in the Ruddiman belt from several North Atlantic deep-sea cores between 45\u00ba and \n\n50\u00b0 N (Ruddiman et al., 1977; Heinrich, 1988; Bond and Lotti, 1995). They were identified in marine \n\nsediments because they left peculiar layers rich in ice-rafted debris (IRD) and detrital carbonate \n\nconcentration (Bond et al., 1992; Broecker et al., 1992; Grousset et al., 1993; Elliot et al., 1998) as well \n\nby minima in foraminifera abundance and synchronous peaks of N. pachyderma (s.) (Broecker et al., \n\n1992; Bond et al., 1993; Bond and Lotti, 1995; Chapman et al., 2000). Moreover, these layers show a \n\nfairly enrichment of highly magnetic minerals of coarser granulometry (e.g. Robinson et al., 1995; \n\nStoner et al., 1996, 2000).  These coarse fraction intervals, representing the well known Heinrich layers, \n\nwere also detected out of the Ruddiman belt i.e. north of 50\u00b0N (e.g. Elliot et al., 1998; Voelker et al., \n\n1998) as well as below 40\u00b0N (e.g. Lebreiro et al.,1996; Naughton et al., 2009). However and up to now \n\nthere are no clear evidences of these layers presence below 37\u00b0N (Baas et al., 1997; Abrantes et al., \n\n1998) for the last glacial and preview climatic cycles.  \n\nThe aim of this work is to access the climatic changes occurred in the North Atlantic Ocean between the \n\nlatitudes of 29\u00baN and 35\u00baN over the last thousands of years. \n\nFor this, we have conducted a detailed study of magnetic properties of three deep sea cores from \n\nAtlantis Seamount (C02: 34.5462\u00baN, 31.9310\u00baW), Great Meteor Tablemount (C05: 29.7034\u00baN, \n\n28.2642\u00baW) and Cruiser Tablemount (C07: 32,024\u00baN; 27,746\u00baW) (Fig.3). Such analyses were \n\ncomplemented by spectral analyses using the multi-taper method (MTM) (Thomson, 1982; Percival and \n\nWalden, 1993), in order to coarsely access the temporal window. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nAssessing climatic changes through environmental magnetic analyses of three sedimentary columns of \n\nthe North Atlantic Ocean (between 29\u00baN and 35\u00baN) \n\nAna Isabel de Jesus Lopes                                                                                  2 \n\n \n\n2. Theoretical background \n\n2.1 Marine sediments \n\nMarine sediments are the main natural archive of information regarding past climate changes and \n\noceanographic conditions, since they can provide a continuous depositional sequence encompassing \n\nlarge time intervals (e.g. Kissel et al., 1998; 1999; Cayre et al., 1999; MacManus et al., 1999; Elliot et \n\nal., 2002; Moreno et al., 2004; Rousse et al., 2006; Voelker et al., 2006; Jullien et al., 2007; Naughton \n\net al., 2007; 2009).  \n\nMarine sedimentary deposits can be neritic or pelagic. Neritic sediments are deposited on shallow \n\nwaters, mostly on continental shelves. These sediments are typically dominated by lithogenous deposits \n\nand are high-rate sedimentation sediments. Pelagic sediments, on the other hand, are low-rate \n\nsedimentation sediments deposited in deep ocean basins. According to the source they are classified as \n\nterrigenous, biogenic, authigenic, volcanogenic and cosmogenic.  \n\nTerrigenous sediments are originated on land from weathering of rocks and delivered to the oceans by \n\nrivers, wind and ice. The supply by rivers is typically limited to areas close to the land. Depending on \n\nthe stratification of the water masses and the density of the material in suspension, some sediment may \n\nfloat for a short period of time on top of seawater or at mid-depth and reach the deep ocean basins, but \n\nthe amount of sediment in these conditions is very low. Sediments transported by wind are aeolian dust, \n\ntypically transported from deserts and continental interiors. Part of sediments transported by ice into \n\nmarine environments is deposited within the limits of continental shelves when the ice melts, with sizes \n\nthat range from boulders to clays. The remaining part is transported further away from the continent \n\nmargins by icebergs. When the icebergs melt, the ice-rafted debris (IRD), i.e. the sediments accumulated \n\nin the base of the iceberg sink and accumulate on the seafloor. These sediments have a size distribution \n\nfrom coarse sands to clays.  Biogenic sediments are formed by the skeletons of small marine organisms \n\nthat live primarily in the water column and represent the main source of sediments in deep \n\nenvironments. As the living organisms die, they sink in the water column and are deposited on the \n\nseafloor. According to the composition of the shells, sediments formed are classified as carbonate ooze \n\n(e.g. foraminifera and coccoliths) and siliceous ooze (e.g. diatoms and radiolarians). Biogenic \n\ncomponent in the ocean floor is controlled by ocean fertility, which controls the amount of biogenic \n\nparticles produced in surface waters and by the water depth which affects the preservation of the \n\nparticles as they settle to the ocean bottom. As the pressure increases and/or temperature decreases, \n\ncalcium carbonate and silica become more soluble. At a certain depth known as carbonate compensation \n\ndepth (~4000 m) and silica compensation depth (~6000 m), all carbonates and silica start to dissolve, \n\nand below these boundaries sediment is free of calcium carbonate and silica, respectively. Authigenic \n\nminerals are formed in situ in sediments and in the ocean floor, from the precipitation of minerals from \n\nthe seawater, which may have diverse origins like hydrothermal activity or biogenically produced \n\nmaterials. Typical examples are iron oxides, manganese nodules, marine phosphates, heavy metals and \n\nglauconite. Volcanic sediments are resultant of volcanic eruptions and are brought into the oceans \n\nmostly by wind. As result, although they are in higher amounts close to volcanoes, they can be globally \n\ndispersed after big eruptions. Although ash layers can be useful for correlation and dating, in general \n\nthey don\u2019t keep any paleoclimatic signal. Cosmic particles are meteor debris and spherules, and \n\nrepresent a smaller fraction of the total of sediment in the oceans, being usually negligible. \n\nOnce deposited, sediments can be transported or reworked by bottom currents which can lead to the \n\nphysical alteration of the sediment and the depositional signal. Other major problem affecting the \n\ndepositional signal of the sediment is post-depositional diagenesis, which is driven by the bacterially \n\ndegradation of organic matter. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nAssessing climatic changes through environmental magnetic analyses of three sedimentary columns of \n\nthe North Atlantic Ocean (between 29\u00baN and 35\u00baN) \n\nAna Isabel de Jesus Lopes                                                                                  3 \n\n \n\n2.2 Variations in Earth\u2019s Orbit \n\nThe influence of the Earth\u2019s orbit on climate has been known since the 19\nth\n century when James Croll \n\nfirst advanced this hypothesis. However, only later in the 20\nth\n century the Siberian mathematician \n\nMilutin Milankovitch elaborated the theory and estimated the duration of these periods, known as \n\nMilankovitch cycles. These cycles correspond to three periodicities of the Earth\u2019s orbit: eccentricity, \n\nobliquity and precession.   \n\nEccentricity corresponds to the change in the shape of the Earth\u00b4s orbit around the Sun, varying from \n\nelliptical to almost circular and it is caused by the interaction of the Earth with the gravitational fields of \n\nthe others planets in the solar system. It has two major cycles of ~413,000 years and ~100,000 years, \n\nand varies between values of about 0 (low eccentricity) and 0.05 (high eccentricity). As a consequence \n\nof the change in the distance between the Earth and the Sun, the amount of radiation arriving to the top \n\nof the atmosphere also changes. When the eccentricity is low, the insolation remains relatively constant \n\nalong the year but when the eccentricity increases, the amount of energy that arrives to the top of the \n\natmosphere is higher than normal at perihelion and lower than normal at aphelion.  \n\nChanges in obliquity of the Earth\u2019s axis correspond to the variation of the angle of the Earth\u2019s axial tilt \n\nwith respect to the plane of the Earth\u2019s orbit. This movement takes approximately 41,000 years to shift \n\nthe tilt between 22.1\u00ba and 24.5\u00ba and back again. Changes in obliquity have an impact on seasonal \n\ncontrasts. When the obliquity increases, summers in both hemispheres tend to receive more radiation \n\nfrom the Sun and winters less and vice-versa. However, the incoming radiation strongly depends on the \n\nlatitudinal distribution. Therefore at high latitude the incoming radiation increases with increasing \n\nobliquity and at lower latitudes the insolation reduces. At high latitudes, cooler summers tend to favor \n\nthe growth of the ice sheets by melting less snow and ice from the previous winter, which means that \n\nsmall tilt angles lead to more glaciations. \n\nPrecession corresponds to a wobbling motion of the spins axis of the Earth, with a period varying \n\nbetween 23,000 to 26,000 years. It is due to gravitational forces exerted by the Sun and the Moon on \n\nthe Earth. This cycle leads to a gradual change in the exact position in the Earth\u2019s orbit where the \n\nequinoxes and solstices occur, which strongly modulate the latitudinal and seasonal distribution of \n\ninsolation. \n\nThese cycles of the Earth\u2019s orbit can sometimes be recorded in paleoclimate data. Once the \n\nmeasurement of a variable which contribute to several cyclic phenomena, each one associated to a \n\ndifferent frequency or period, will contain the overlapping of all these contributions, the different \n\nfrequencies can be identified in the spectrum of the signal. The most common way to access this \n\ninformation is using spectral analysis, which allows checking for cyclic behavior within the time series. \n\nUsing the Fourier transform, any time series of 2N elements equally spaced is decomposed into a sum of \n\nN harmonics of different amplitude. \n\nThe power spectrum can be estimated using the multi-taper method (MTM) (Thomson, 1982; Percival \n\nand Walden, 1993) as implemented in the SSA-MTM toolkit (Dettinger et al., 1995) and available in \n\nhttp://www.atmos.ucla.edu/tcd/ssa/. MTM attempts to reduce the variance and bias of spectral \n\nestimates by using a small set of tapers (orthogonal window filters multiplying the time series in order to \n\navoid leakage), rather than the unique data taper or spectral window used by Blackman-Tukey methods. \n\nIt is recommended to use a number K=3 of tapers in order to ensure a good compromise between the \n\nrequired frequency resolution for resolving distinct climate signals and the benefit of multiple spectral \n\ndegrees of freedom. The spectrum is decomposed into a component called \u201charmonic\u201d which \n\ncorresponds to the significant component and a component called \u201creshaped\u201d which corresponds to \n\ncontribution that remains after the harmonic component is removed. The search for oscillation spells is \n\nobtained through application of the Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) (Ghil et al., 2002).  \n\nhttp://www.atmos.ucla.edu/tcd/ssa/\n\n\n \n\nAssessing climatic changes through environmental magnetic analyses of three sedimentary columns of \n\nthe North Atlantic Ocean (between 29\u00baN and 35\u00baN) \n\nAna Isabel de Jesus Lopes                                                                                  4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1: Scheme of the variation of the Milankovitch cycles: Eccentricity, Obliquity and Precession \n\n(Figure from Chamberlain and Dickey, 2007).  \n\n\n\n \n\nAssessing climatic changes through environmental magnetic analyses of three sedimentary columns of \n\nthe North Atlantic Ocean (between 29\u00baN and 35\u00baN) \n\nAna Isabel de Jesus Lopes                                                                                  5 \n\n \n\n2.3 Methods to characterize magnetic phases \n\nIn environmental magnetism the study of magnetic properties is used to assess information about \n\nconcentration, mineralogy and grain size in sediments, because they are controlled by the environmental \n\nprocesses. The most relevant measurements are magnetic susceptibility, anhysteretic and isothermal \n\nremanent magnetizations and hysteresis parameters (e.g. Evans and Heller, 2003; Peters and Dekkers, \n\n2003; Liu et al., 2012).  \n\n \n\nMagnetic susceptibility \n\nMagnetic susceptibility or more precisely the volume magnetic susceptibility, k is defined as the ratio \n\nbetween the induced magnetization (M) and the applied field (H), i.e.  \n\n \n\nH\n\nM\nk ?  (1) \n\n \n\nSince both the induced magnetization and the applied field have units of A/m (in SI system) the \n\nmagnetic susceptibility is dimensionless.  The mass susceptibility, ? is obtained dividing by the sample \n\ndensity, ?: \n\n \n\n?\n?\n\nk\n?  (2) \n\n  \n\nand in this case the units are m\n3\n/kg. \n\n? is a measure of how \u201cmagnetizable\u201d a sample is for a certain applied field. It is strongly dependent on \n\nthe concentration and on the composition of the samples and constitutes a useful parameter to identify \n\nthe amount of magnetic minerals within a sample. Most kinds of minerals are either diamagnetic or \n\nparamagnetic. Application of the magnetic field alters the orbital motion of the electrons and produces a \n\nsmall induced magnetization, which is linearly dependent on the applied field and reduces to zero when \n\nthe field is removed (Fig. 2).  \n\nDiamagnetism comes from atoms without atomic magnetic moments and when diamagnetic materials \n\nacquire a magnetization, this is antiparallel to the applied field and the susceptibility resultant is \n\nnegative and independent of the temperature. \n\nParamagnetism, on the other hand, arises from the presence of atoms in which the adjacent atomic \n\nmoments don\u2019t interact. Magnetization of paramagnetic materials is parallel to the applied field and the \n\nsusceptibility is positive and strongly dependent on the temperature. \n\nThere is another kind of magnetic behavior of special interest: ferromagnetism. Ferromagnetism is \n\noriginated from atoms with magnetic moments, in which adjacent atomic moments interact strongly. The \n\neffect of the interaction is to produce strong magnetizations that can be several orders of magnitude \n\nlarger than for paramagnetic materials in the same magnetizing field. In ferromagnetic materials, when \n\nthe applied field is removed, magnetization does not return to zero but is retained.  \n\n\n\n \n\nAssessing climatic changes through environmental magnetic analyses of three sedimentary columns of \n\nthe North Atlantic Ocean (between 29\u00baN and 35\u00baN) \n\nAna Isabel de Jesus Lopes                                                                                  6 \n\n \nFigure 2: Examples of the magnetization acquired by: a) diamagnetic; b) paramagnetic; and c) \n\nferromagnetic minerals (from the left to the right, respectively). \n\n \n\nFrequency-dependent susceptibility \n\n?FD denotes the frequency dependence of the magnetic susceptibility. This dependence arises from \n\nparticles with superparamagnetic (SP) behavior, which reacts more intensively to applied fields with \n\nlower frequency.  \n\n?FD is usually given in percentage and calculated such as: \n\n100?\n?\n\n?\n?\n??\n\n?\nLF\n\nHFLF\n\nFD\n (3) \n\nIn which ?LF and ?HF are the magnetic susceptibilities measured at low and high frequency, respectively. \nAccording to Dearing et al (1996) ?FD can give a qualitative idea of the typical grain size of the \n\ndominant magnetic minerals. Therefore, if: i) ?FD &lt;2%, signal dominated by frequency-independent \n\ngrains, with single-domain (SD) and multi-domain (MD) sizes; ii) ?FD > 6%, signal dominated by \n\nfrequency-dependent grains, within the superparamagnetic (SP) grains size and; iii) 2 &lt;?FD &lt;6 %, \n\nmixture of both type of behaviors. \n\n \n\n \n\nIsothermal Remanent Magnetization \n\n \n\nAn isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) is acquired when a sample is exposed to a strong and \n\nalmost instantaneous magnetic field at constant temperature. In nature, it is a rare phenomenon although \n\nit can occur as the result of lightning strikes, being the most common form of IRM, the one acquired in \n\nlaboratory. \n\nIRM curves are acquired on previously demagnetized samples and consist in exposure a sample to a \n\nsuccessively higher magnetic field until the sample is saturated, acquiring a saturation IRM (SIRM). At \n\nthis point, if the field is increased beyond this limit, magnetization will remain constant.  \n\nRobertson and France (1994) showed that the magnetic mineral phases contributing to a IRM curve \n\nhave an acquisition path similar to a cumulative log-Gaussian (CLG) function, described using three  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nAssessing climatic changes through environmental magnetic analyses of three sedimentary columns of \n\nthe North Atlantic Ocean (between 29\u00baN and 35\u00baN) \n\nAna Isabel de Jesus Lopes                                                                                  7 \n\n \n\nparameters: i) SIRM: the saturation of the IRM, providing an indication on the concentration of \n\nmagnetic minerals, ii) B1/2: the medium destructive field, which corresponds to the applied field at \n\nwhich the half of the SIRM is acquired, providing a measure of the mean coercivity, iii) DP: the \n\ndispersion parameter, expressing the coercivity distribution. IRM curves are usually analyzed with the \n\nmethod developed by Kruiver et al. (2001), which allows the determination of these parameters through \n\nthe fit of the IRM acquisition data versus the logarithm of the applied field with the acquisition curve \n\nexpressed: i) on a linear scale (LAP), ii) as a gradient (GAP) and iii) on a probability scale (SAP). \n\n \n\nS-ratio \n\nThe S-ratio gives an idea about the relative abundance between high and low coercivity magnetic \n\nminerals, within a sample. The S-ratio is calculated as S = -IRM-03T/ IRM1T (King and Channell, 1991), \n\ni.e. an IRM is acquired in a direct field of 1 T, followed by the acquisition of another IRM in a \n\nbackfield of 0.3 T. Usually it is used the field of 0.3 T because is the maximum value for the \n\ncoercivities of the titanomagnetite solid solution. Other iron oxides (like hematite) and iron-sulfides (like \n\npyrrothite and goethite) commonly show higher coercivities (Dunlop and \u00d6zdemir, 1997). \n\nTherefore, as closer the values of S-ratio are from the unity, higher is the signature of low-coercivity \n\nmagnetic minerals. \n\n \n\nAnhysteretic Remanent Magnetization \n\n \n\nAnhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) is a laboratory-produced magnetization generated when a \n\nsample is placed under an alternating magnetic field (e.g. ~100 mT) superimposed by a small direct \n\nbiased field (e.g. ~50 \u00b5T). The alternating field unlocks the magnetic moments of the sample and the \n\nDC bias field magnetizes all particles with coercivity equal or lesser than the maximum field along the \n\ndirection of the direct field. It responds preferentially to SD grains, because they are more efficient at \n\nacquiring remanence than larger particles. \n\nARM is also proportional to the direct bias field and is therefore common expressed as the ARM \n\nsusceptibility (?ARM). ?ARM is the mass normalized ARM (in Am\n2\n/kg) per unit bias field. Therefore, both \n\nARM and ?ARM are proportional to the concentration and coercivity of the main magnetic carriers. \n\n \n\n?ARM/? and ARM/SIRM \n \n\n?ARM/? and ARM/SIRM (Banerjee et al., 1981; King et al., 1982) ratios are widely used as magnetite \n\ngrain size indicator. All the magnetic parameters used in both ratios are sensitive to the concentration of \n\nferromagnetic minerals. However, ARM (or ?ARM) is particularly sensitive to the coercivity of magnetite \n\ngrains, following a log quasi-linear decrease with increasing grain size (e.g. Egli and Lowrie, 2002). \n\nAlthough ? and IRM tend to increase from SD to MD grains, they are relatively independent of grain \n\nsize when compared to ?ARM and ARM. Therefore, such ratios will be mostly sensitive to variations of \n\nmagnetic coercivity, i.e., inferring the grain size according to the variations of ARM. \n\n \n\nHysteresis parameters  \n\nWhen ferrimagnetic minerals are magnetized by a magnetic field they present hysteresis behavior and \n\nthe determination of specific parameters that are related with the physical properties of the main \n\nmagnetic carriers.  \n\nConcentration of magnetic minerals can be accessed using the saturation magnetization (Ms), which is \n\nthe magnetization contained within a sample when the magnetic moments are fully aligned with the \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nAssessing climatic changes through environmental magnetic analyses of three sedimentary columns of \n\nthe North Atlantic Ocean (between 29\u00baN and 35\u00baN) \n\nAna Isabel de Jesus Lopes                                                                                  8 \n\n \n\nmagnetizing field and/or using the remanent saturation magnetization (Mrs or SIRM) which corresponds \n\nto the magnetization that remains after removed the applied field.  \n\nCoercivity of the remanence (Hc) is the applied field needed to remove the induced magnetization back \n\nto zero and coercive remanent force (Hcr) is the reversed field needed to remove Mrs.  \n\nAlthough Hc and Hcr can give some information about the coercivity of the minerals, they are not much \n\nused in this form. Instead their ratio is a powerful grain size indicator (Day et al., 1977). \n\nHysteresis parameters are particularly useful to assess grain size information, using the plot of \n\ncoercivity ratio (Hcr/Hc) versus magnetization ratio (Mrs/Ms) known as Day plot (Day et al., 1977). This \n\ngraph was initially proposed to distinguish particle sizes in titanomagnetites and was then improved \n\nwith the integration of the theoretical curves proposed by Dunlop (2002a, b), allowing this way a better \n\nconstrained of the grain size, namely the SP particles and mixtures of magnetic minerals. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nAssessing climatic changes through environmental magnetic analyses of three sedimentary columns of \n\nthe North Atlantic Ocean (between 29\u00baN and 35\u00baN) \n\nAna Isabel de Jesus Lopes                                                                                  9 \n\n \n\n3. Methods and Sampling \n\nThe three cores analyzed in this work were recovered during an oceanographic mission of the Task \n\nGroup for the Extension of the Continental Shelf (EMEPC) at the Atlantic Ocean in the year of 2007 \n\n(see location at Fig. 3). \n\nCore C02 was collected near Atlantis Seamount (34.5462\u00baN; 31.9310\u00baW) from a water depth of 3500 \n\nm, allowing the recovery of 114 cubic samples along the 300 cm length. \n\nCore C05 was taken from Great Meteor Tablemount (29.7034\u00baN; 28.2642\u00baW) at 2500 m water depth.  \n\nFirst 47cm of the core presented very disturbed sediment and were excluded, only allowing the recovery \n\nof 58 samples along the 347 cm length. \n\nCore C07 was located around Cruiser Tablemount (32,024\u00baN; 27,746\u00baW) in a water depth of 1840 m \n\nand a total of 157 samples were collected from the 250 cm length. \n\nThe cores were sampled using plastic cubic boxes of 8 cm\n3\n, which were kept at approximately 4\u00baC to \n\nprevent chemical alterations. Samples were dried before measurements and the respective mass \n\nmeasured for latter normalization of the several magnetic parameters here used.  \n\nMagnetic susceptibility (?) was measured in all samples at three distinct frequencies of 976, 3904 and \n\n15616 Hz in an applied field of 200A/m using the MFK1 Kappabridge. Anhysteretic remanent \n\nmagnetization (ARM) was imparted in a maximum alternating field of 100 mT and a DC bias field of \n\n50 \u00b5T, using AMU-1A coupled with LDA-3A AF demagnetizer. The anhysteretic susceptibility, ?ARM \nwas calculated as the ARM intensity normalized by the DC bias field. The isothermal remanent \n\nmagnetization (IRM) was gradually acquired until a maximum applied field of 1.2T, using an IM-10-30 \n\nimpulse magnetizer. IRM was also acquired in a field of 1 T followed by the acquisition of the IRM in a \n\nback field of -0.3 T to determine the S-ratio. The remanent magnetizations were acquired in selected \n\nsamples and measured in the low speed mode of JR-6 magnetometer in order to avoid sediment \n\nperturbations. \n\nMagnetic analyses of core C07 were complemented by classical hysteresis measurements. Hysteresis \n\nloops were performed in Laboratory of Rock Magnetism, Institute of Geophysics ASCR in Prague, \n\nusing the EV9 Vibrating Sample Magnetometer made by ADE Corporation (USA).The measurement \n\nsequence includes hysteresis loop and isothermal remanent magnetization acquisition followed by D.C. \n\nremagnetization. Short sequence includes hysteresis loop and D.C. remagnetization. \n\nLoops of the full sequence were measured until the maximum applied field of \u00b12 T and the short \n\nsequence was measured until \u00b11 T. \n\nIsothermal remanent magnetization acquisition was measured on previously demagnetized sample after \n\nthe application of fields from 0 to 2 T and a total of 95 data points were obtained for each sample. \n\nThe D.C. remagnetization was measured after previous saturation in a field of -1 T being followed by \n\nthe same procedure as in the IRM acquisition, except in the case of the short sequence where the \n\nmaximum applied field was 650 mT. \n\nThe grain size analysis of core C07 was conducted in 65 samples using a laser granulometer, Malvern \n\nParticle Size Analyzer Mastersizer MS2000, which provides the grain-size data as a volume for all the \n\ntextural distribution (0.02 \u00b5m to 2 mm). Sediment textural type was determined according to Flemming \n\n(2000). \n\nSpectral analysis was performed using the Multi-Taper method (MTM) (Thomson, 1982), which has \n\nthe advantage of reducing spectral leakage (bias) by obtaining multiple independent estimates from the \n\nsame sample, being particularly efficient for small datasets as it is the case.

Results  \n\n4.1 Environmental magnetism analyses \n\n? presents significant variations along the sedimentary columns C02 and C07 (between 10\n-9 \n\n-10\n-7 \n\nm\n3\n/kg), \n\nmostly characterized by several peaks that are separated by intervals with stable values (Fig. 4). \n\nException to this behavior is achieved for core C05, which shows low and quite stable values along the \n\nsedimentary column (around 10\n-9\n-10\n\n-8 \nm\n\n3\n/kg).  \n\nC02 is characterized by a sharp decay of ? on the top of the core, with highest values, followed by a \n\ntrend towards lowest values, closest to the average until the core base. This behavior is only interrupted \n\nby a well defined interval between 161 and 120 cm with the minimum values observed in core. In C07 \n\nthe intervals of 198-147 cm and 96-4 cm are rather variable and present the highest values of ?. In \n\ncontrast, the intervals 246-200 cm and 146-97 cm are relatively stable and have the lowest values \n\n(Fig.4). \n\n \n\nThe behavior of ? is similar to the observed for magnetic parameters sensitive to the amount of \n\nferromagnetic (s.l.) carriers, like IRM1T (Fig. 4). The comparison between ? with such remanent \n\nparameter shows a linear trend (cf. Fig. 5), pointing for ferromagnetic (s.l.) as the class of magnetic \n\nminerals responsible for the variations observed at ?. \n\n \n\nIn order to analyze the main ferromagnetic carriers IRM acquisition was conducted until the applied \n\nfield of 1.2 T in C02 and C05 and 2.0 T in C07. From such analyses it is observed a strong increase of \n\nthe remanence until the applied field of 300 mT, followed by a gradual and slight increase of IRM until \n\nthe maximum applied field (Fig. 6). This denotes the presence of a mixture of magnetic minerals with \n\ndistinct coercivities, which is confirmed by the cumulative log-Gaussian analysis (Robertson and \n\nFrance, 1994; Kruiver et al., 2001).The lower coercivity component presents values of B1/2 around 42-\n\n76 mT, contributing with 82-94% to the total remanence (Table 1). Conversely, the higher coercivity \n\ncomponent has values of B1/2 of 30-630 mT and contributes with 6-18% to the total magnetic signal. \n\nThe three cores are characterized by relatively uniform values of S-ratio which in general don\u2019t vary \n\nbeyond 0.88-0.93 (Fig.7). C02 is quite uniform in depth while C05 and C07 exhibit marked down-core \n\nchanges. A decrease of this parameter is observed in C05 in the interval between 151-53 cm and in C07 \n\nbetween 191-170 cm, corresponding to an increase of the high coercive component. On the other hand, \n\nan increase of the S-ratio is observed in C05 in the intervals between 282 -154 cm and in C07 between \n\n82-75, i.e. in these intervals the contribution of high-coercive minerals is negligible. \n\nS-ratio supports the IRM results suggesting low-coercive minerals, most likely magnetite or its oxidized \n\ncounterpart maghemite as the predominant magnetic carriers with minor contributions of high-coercive \n\nmagnetic minerals such as hematite and/or goethite (Oldfield, 1991; Liu et al., 2012). \n\n \n\nThe ratios ?ARM/? and ARM/IRM1T are sensitive to the magnetic mineral grain size and have similar \n\ntrends along the cores (Fig.7).  \n\nThe thinner particles appear in C02 in the intervals 214-195 cm and 156-125 cm and in C07 between \n\n152-89 cm. In general, magnetic grain size tends to slightly increases from the core base towards the \n\nsurface.Exception to this behavior is achieved for C05, whose grain size is the thinnest and does not \n\npresent the well defined intervals observed in the other two cores. \n\nThe ?FD, which is sensitive to the SP ferrimagnetic grains, presents values between 1% and 9% (Fig.7). \n\nAccording to Dearing et al. (1996) this indicates that the cores are essentially composed by a mixture of \n\nSP and SD/MD  grains for values of 2 &lt;?FD&lt;6% and mostly by SP grains where ?FD  > 6%, which is \n\nmainly observed in C02 between 155-130 cm and in C07 between 147-94 cm. \n\n\n\n \n\nAssessing climatic changes through environmental magnetic analyses of three sedimentary columns of \n\nthe North Atlantic Ocean (between 29\u00baN and 35\u00baN) \n\nAna Isabel de Jesus Lopes                                                                                  12 \n\n \nFigure 4: Concentration dependent parameters determined for core C02, core C05 and core C07: \nmagnetic susceptibility (orange); isothermal remanent magnetization acquired at 1T (green); and \n\nanhysteretic susceptibility (blue). \n\n\n\n \n\nAssessing climatic changes through environmental magnetic analyses of three sedimentary columns of \n\nthe North Atlantic Ocean (between 29\u00baN and 35\u00baN) \n\nAna Isabel de Jesus Lopes                                                                                  13 \n\n \nFigure 5: Comparison between magnetic susceptibility and isothermal remanent magnetization \n\nacquired at 1T for C02, C05 and C07. \n\n\n\n \n\nAssessing climatic changes through environmental magnetic analyses of three sedimentary columns of \n\nthe North Atlantic Ocean (between 29\u00baN and 35\u00baN) \n\nAna Isabel de Jesus Lopes                                                                                  14 \n\n \n\nTable 1- Parameters describing the IRM acquisition curves of C02, C05 and C07* \n\n  Component 1 Component 2 \n\nSample Depth Cont.

A high fraction of diamagnetic minerals and paramagnetic minerals with weak \n\nferrimagnetic content, define three intervals between 246-196, 159-94 cm and 26-4 cm. Intercalated \n\nwith them, two other intervals between 192-165 cm and 89-28 cm are characterized by paramagnetic \n\nminerals with high fraction of ferrimagnetic content (Fig.8). \n\nMs and Mrs can reflect magnetic mineral concentration when the magnetic grain size and mineralogy \n\nremain relatively constant (Liu et al., 2012), as observed in C07. Ms and Mrs show good agreement with \n\nthe results obtained for ?, IRM1T, ?ARM (Fig. 6), showing two intervals with low and quite stable values \n\n(between 246-196 cm and 151-94 cm) and other two intervals with variable and highest values            \n\n(between 192-159 cm and 89-28 cm). \n\nInformation about grain size can be accessed from the Mrs/Ms and Hcr/Hc ratios which show the similar \n\npattern observed for ?ARM/? and ARM/IRM1T ratios along the core (cf.

Data obtained \n\nfrom the hysteresis loop confirms the presence of finer particles between 152 and 94 cm and coarser \n\ngrains on the top of the core (Fig. 8). \n\nAdditional information about grain size variation can be inferred from the Day plot (Day et al, 1977) \n\nwith the theoretical curves proposed by Dunlop (2002a). The hysteresis parameters displayed in the Day \n\nplot (Fig. 8) are distributed on the PSD domain, following approximately the SD+MD mixing curves, \n\nbut shifted towards the right, which could be explained by the presence of SP particles (Dunlop, 2002a, \n\nb).

Although the \n\nsedimentation rates can vary significantly from one oceanic basin to another, depending essentially on \n\nthe type of environment, values here obtained, although low are within the typical values observed for \n\npelagic sediments, which are around 1 cm/kyr (e.g. Liu et al., 2012). \n\nOnce the three \n14\n\nC ages obtained for C05 show values > 43,500 BP the sedimentation rates weren\u2019t \n\nestimated. \n\nTable 2- Radiocarbon dates and sedimentation rates obtained for the first centimeters of \n\neach core (Palma, Ph.D. thesis in prep.). \n\nCore Depth (cm) Radiocarbon age \nCalibration method \n\n2? \n\nSedimentation rate \n\n(cm/yr) \n\nC02 \n9 8580 \u00b1 40 BP 9530-9420 BP 0.0009 \n\n22 41670 \u00b1 640 BP 45930-44300 BP 0.0005 \n\nC05 \n\n12 > 43500 \n\n- - 22 > 43500 \n\n36 > 43500 \n\nC07 \n\n  \n36640-36190 BP 0.001 \n\n40 31880 \u00b1 240 BP and and \n\n  \n35930-35520 BP 0.001 \n\n \n\nSince the results obtained by radiocarbon dates are limited to a few centimeters of the sedimentary \n\ncolumns, a tentative to obtain possible sedimentation rates for the entire columns was made using \n\nspectral analyses for ? and ARM/IRM1T ratio time series. Assuming that the peaks observed in the \n\npower spectrum correspond to the Milankovitch orbital cycles, we may be able to deduce possible \n\nsedimentation rates by fitting the peaks observed to the periods corresponding to the precession (23,000-\n\n26,000 years), obliquity (41,000 years) and eccentricity (100,000 years).   \n\nTaking a sedimentation rate of 1 cm/kyr, the power spectrum of C02 shows significant spectral peaks \n\nfor ? and for ARM/IRM1T ratio. In ? power spectrum two peaks appear near the periods of 43,000 \n\nyears and 93,000 years, suggesting a close link to the obliquity (41,000 years) and eccentricity (100,000 \n\nyears) orbital forcing\u2019s (Fig. 9). In ARM/IRM1T power spectrum three peaks closely follow periodicities \n\nof about 26,000 years, 42,000 years and 87,000 years possibly linked to the precession (23,000-26,000 \n\nyears), obliquity (41,000 years) and eccentricity (100,000 years). For C07, the ? power spectrum does \n\nnot show any significant peak, but the ARM/IRM1T ratio power spectrum displays two meaningful \n\npeaks centered near the periodicities of 23,000 and 53,000 years.  As the second peak corresponds to a \n\nwide sinusoid spanning from 33,000 to 141,000 years, which do not correspond to any climatic \n\ncyclicity, we recalculate the spectrum assuming a sedimentation rate of 1.6 cm/kyr. In this case, the \n\nARM/IRM1T power spectrum shows two peaks centered at about 36,000 years and 86,000 years, which \n\nare not far from the obliquity (41,000 years) and eccentricity (100,000 years) orbital forcing\u2019s. \n\n\n\n \n\nAssessing climatic changes through environmental magnetic analyses of three sedimentary columns of \n\nthe North Atlantic Ocean (between 29\u00baN and 35\u00baN) \n\nAna Isabel de Jesus Lopes                                                                                  21 \n\n \nFigure 10: Power spectra obtained by MTM and 50% (median), 90%, 95%, 99% confidence levels for \nmagnetic susceptibility and ARM/IRM1T ratio, respectively from the left to the right, considering: a) a \n\nsedimentation rate of 1 cm/kyr for C02; b) a sedimentation rate of 1 cm/kyr for C07; and c) a \nsedimentation rate of 1.6 cm/kyr for C07. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nAssessing climatic changes through environmental magnetic analyses of three sedimentary columns of \n\nthe North Atlantic Ocean (between 29\u00baN and 35\u00baN) \n\nAna Isabel de Jesus Lopes                                                                                  22 \n\n \n\n5. Discussion \n\nThe environmental magnetic analyses here conducted indicate that magnetite and/or maghemite are \n\nresponsible for approximately 90% of the magnetic signature. Parameters sensitive to the concentration \n\nof these magnetic carriers (e.g., ?, IRM1T and Ms) show significant variations along the core. Such \n\nvariations correspond to intervals with several peaks of magnetic susceptibility interrupted by others \n\nwith low and stable values.  \n\nThese intervals have a correspondence in terms of the magnetic granulometric state. Intervals with low \n\nand stable concentration of ferromagnetic carriers present an increase on ?FD values as well on ratios \n\nARM/IRM1T, ?ARM/?, Mrs/Ms and decrease on ratio Hcr/Hc. Therefore, all of these parameters point \n\ntowards the presence of thinner ferromagnetic granulometry. Otherwise, intervals dominated by the \n\noccurrence of several magnetic susceptibility peaks show the opposite behavior in what concerns the \n\nseveral magnetic parameters sensitive to the magnetic grain size, i.e., pointing towards a coarser \n\nmagnetic granulometry (see relative distribution of magnetic grainulometry at Day diagram \u2013Fig. 8). \n\nBy comparing the behavior of magnetic parameters sensitive to the magnetic concentration and grain \n\nsize, namely ? and ARM/IRM1T it is possible to separate the cores C02 and C07 into four main \n\nmagnetic units (cf. Fig. 11). Units I and III represent the sedimentary layers with stable concentration of \n\nferromagnetic grains of thinner size. Units II and IV represent the intervals with several peaks of ? and \n\ncoarser magnetic carriers. The limits between these units are achieved at 255, 155 and 75 cm for core \n\nC02, and at 196, 146 and 97 cm for core C07. \n\n \nFigure 11: Comparison between magnetic susceptibility (orange) and ARM/IRM1T ratio (blue) for core \nC02 and core C07, respectively. Magnetic units are identified by the numbers on the right side of the \n\nplot. \n\nAs above mentioned, units I and III, present a low and stable concentration of thinner magnetic grains, \n\nwhich is indicative of stable conditions in the depositional environment. According to the high field \n\nanalyses, these units are fairly rich in diamagnetic minerals. These minerals are commonly observed in \n\ndeep sea environments as a result of high biogenic activity, deriving from the water column which is \n\nmainly composed of carbonate ooze (e.g. Levin and Gooday, 2003). These intervals represent a typical \n\npelagic sedimentation with low terrigenous component that is in general rich in paramagnetic and \n\nferromagnetic minerals. The decrease of detrital inputs into the oceanic basins mostly occur during cold \n\nand dry periods, i.e., during glacial periods (e.g. Sagnotti et al., 1998). Therefore, several evidences \n\nsustain units I and III as being representative of a sedimentation regime contemporaneous of glacial   \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nAssessing climatic changes through environmental magnetic analyses of three sedimentary columns of \n\nthe North Atlantic Ocean (between 29\u00baN and 35\u00baN) \n\nAna Isabel de Jesus Lopes                                                                                  23 \n\n \n\nperiods. The thinner magnetic particles at units I and III also suggests the presence of biomineralization \n\nprocesses. Since 1975 (Blakemore, 1975) it is known that some bacteria are able to produce thinner \n\nparticles of magnetite that works as a navigational system (magnetotactic bacteria). These bacteria are \n\nfound in several environmental settings, including deep-ocean basins (Evans and Heller, 2003). The size \n\nof bio-formed magnetite grains typically range from nanometers to micrometers, i.e., within the \n\ngranulometric behavior of superparamagnetic \u2013 SP to single-domain \u2013 SD particles (Kopp and \n\nKirschvink, 2007). Looking for the magnetic granulometry (cf. relative distribution of magnetic \n\ngranulometry at Day diagram \u2013 Fig. 8), it is easily recognized that these units show a relative increase \n\nof the thinner magnetic fraction, with significant contribution of particles in the superparamagnetic (SP) \n\n\u2013 single-domain (SD) range. \n\nOn the other hand, the intervals characterized by several peaks of magnetic susceptibility, show coarser \n\nmagnetic grain size and increase of the paramagnetic content (units II and IV), denoting totally different \n\nenvironmental conditions. These characteristics claim for significant inputs of terrigenous sediments. \n\nOne could expect that the mechanism responsible for the transport of paramagnetic and coarser \n\nferromagnetic minerals in these intervals would have to be strong enough to put coarser minerals in \n\nmotion, something that did not happen during the periods in which ? is relatively constant and the \n\nparticle size is quite thin. Since the area occupied by the two cores is not supplied by rivers, these \n\nmagnetic minerals should have been transported by icebergs melting and/or wind, which carry ice rafted \n\ndebris and dust, which correspond to the large sources of terrestrial material into the deep Atlantic \n\nOcean basins at high (e.g. McManus et al., 1998; Watkins et al., 2007) and low latitudes (e.g. Rea, \n\n1994; Maher, 2011), respectively.  \n\nHigh values of ? associated with coarser magnetic carriers are typically observed in ice rafted-debris \n\n(IRD) transported to the ocean during the well-known Heinrich events (e.g. Robinson et al., 1995; \n\nStoner et al., 1996, 2000).  Moreover, the dominant presence of low coercivity magnetic minerals, with \n\nS-ratio > 0.9 supports this interpretation (Grousset et al., 1993; Hemming et al., 2004). \n\nThe sediments are relatively thin (<100 \u00b5m), which contradicts the typical definition of IRD as being \n\ncoarse lithic grains (>150 \u00b5m). Although considerable disagreement still exists about the quantification \n\nof IRD in marine sediments (see Hemming, 2004), according to Andrews (2000) the coarse fraction \n\npresent in the base of the icebergs is generally small and the grain size is strongly dependent on the \n\nprovenance of the sediments eroded by the glaciers as well by the distance of transport under the glacier. \n\nSince we do not observe any increase in the total size of the particles that compose the cores (at least for \n\nC07), but only an increase in the size of the magnetic minerals, it could mean that the sediments \n\nsuffered a large transport.  Although the water temperature during the Heinrich events at latitudes south \n\nof 40\u00baN in the central Atlantic were cool, studies suggest that was too warm to sustain icebergs drifting \n\n(Cortijo et al., 1997). However it is possible that after the melting of the icebergs, the thinner fraction \n\nthe IRD may has been transported by deep sea currents away from the melting point of the icebergs and \n\nthus reaching these relatively low latitudes (Watkins et al., 2007). \n\nIn C07 between 192-165 cm, variable values of ? and coarse minerals are associated with low S-ratios, \n\nimplying the presence of high coercivity minerals such as hematite (cf. Fig.7 and Fig.11). In this case, a \n\npossible transport of dust probably from Africa\u2019s inland seems more likely, due to the presence of the \n\nhigh coercivity minerals (e.g. Rea, 1994; Maher, 2011). The presence of dust only in C07 can be \n\nexplained by geographical position of the core, located further south than C02, which could have \n\nallowed that during certain periods, winds carrying particles from the African continent have reached \n\nthe location of the core. However, possible IRD sourced from other continental rocks rich in high \n\ncoercivity minerals is also possible (e.g. Channell et al., 2013). \n\n \n\nThe presence of HE records at such low latitudes, if confirmed, will provide new insights about the \n\nposition of the polar front and Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during these extreme episodes. \n\nEvaluating changes in the polar front and ITCZ positions will contribute to the understanding of couple \n\natmosphere \u2013 ocean systems behavior. In order to confirm the evidences of the presence of IRD \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nAssessing climatic changes through environmental magnetic analyses of three sedimentary columns of \n\nthe North Atlantic Ocean (between 29\u00baN and 35\u00baN) \n\nAna Isabel de Jesus Lopes                                                                                  24 \n\n \n\nadditional information provided by independent proxies like also Ca/Sr ratio and Sr-Nd isotope \n\ncomposition are needed. \n\n \n\nAccess to an accurate evaluation of the sedimentation rates is also crucial to frame temporally the \n\nsedimentary record. Once the ages available by \n14\n\nC are very limited in number and temporal range, we \n\nare unable to know with the desired accuracy the evolution of the sedimentation rates along both cores. \n\nTherefore, despite the peaks of susceptibility seems to resemble IRD-type sediments we cannot ensure \n\nthat they occur during interglacial periods. As example, Kissel et al. (1999) in a study of several deep \n\nsea cores distributed within the Atlantic Ocean reported coarse magnetic minerals associated with \n\nsusceptibility maxima and finer grains coincident with susceptibility minima, like we have. However, \n\ntheir age models indicate that the maxima in the amount of magnetic minerals coincided with warm \n\nperiods and not with Heinrich events or even cold periods. Based on this, they concluded that they were \n\nnot in the presence of IRD and the mechanism responsible for the transport of the magnetic minerals \n\nwas deep sea currents. For an appropriate interpretation of what is recorded in these cores, a complete \n\nage model is essential. However for such ancient sediments the most suitable method is oxygen isotope \n\nstratigraphy, which is a relatively slow method, and despite our efforts to get the results at time, this \n\nwas not possible and it is still ongoing. \n\n \n\nIn the absence of direct methods to infer the sedimentation rates, spectral analyses were used,  assuming \n\nsedimentation rates of 1 cm/kyr (C02) and 1.6 cm/kyr (C07), as merely first approximations. Results \n\nobtained for core C02 are in a satisfactory agreement with the Milankovitch orbital cycles, namely with \n\nthe obliquity (41,000 years) and eccentricity (100,000 years) orbital forcing\u2019s periods. The same is not \n\nobserved for core C07. The most likely explanation for the absence of spectral peaks in ? is the fact that \n\nthe ? data series show a well-marked peak centered between 85-75 cm (cf. Fig. 4). Since the MTM \n\ngives more importance to data centered at the middle of the series and less to the corners, it is very likely \n\nthat the method is giving to much weight to this \u201canomalous\u201d data. In the case of ARM/IRM1T power \n\nspectrum, for a sedimentation rate of 1 cm/kyr a wide peak appears from the period of ~40,000 to \n\n~100,000 years. This peak can be justified in the same way than the absence of spectral peaks in ?. The \n\nMTM may be giving to much weigh to a peak observed in the data series of ARM/IRM1T between 150-\n\n100 cm (cf. Fig. 7). Data series not large enough, the occurrence of some extreme phenomenon whose \n\nsignal is superimposed to the climatic forcing and a variable sedimentation rate, are other possible \n\nexplanations for the failure of spectral analyses at C07. \n\n \n\nUnlike the others cores, C05: i) does not present well defined intervals (cf. Figs. 4 and 7); ii) presents \n\nlow and stable susceptibility values along the sedimentary column; and iii) all the \n14\n\nC ages gave ages \n\nhigher than 43,500 years. Once this core was retrieved at the flank of the Great Meteor Tablemount, it \n\nis suggested that the \u201csedimentary homogenization\u201d result from a landslide and respective gravity \n\ncurrent. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nAssessing climatic changes through environmental magnetic analyses of three sedimentary columns of \n\nthe North Atlantic Ocean (between 29\u00baN and 35\u00baN) \n\nAna Isabel de Jesus Lopes                                                                                  25 \n\n \n\n6. Conclusions \n\n \n\nThe study of three sedimentary cores located in the Atlantic Ocean between the latitudes of 29\u00ba and \n\n35\u00baN, allowed access the evolution of climate through different environmental conditions during the past \n\nthousands of years.    \n\nMagnetic results show that that magnetite and/or maghemite are responsible for ~90% of the magnetic \n\nsignal encountered at these cores. The remaining signal result from high coercivity minerals, must \n\nprobably hematite and/or goethite.  \n\nThe sedimentary columns C02 and C07 present transitions between stable and rather variable intervals \n\nof magnetic susceptibility values and magnetic grain size. The stable intervals are characterized by low \n\nand almost constant values of magnetic susceptibility, regular thinner particles and high fraction of \n\ndiamagnetic minerals. On the other hand, intervals with strong variations of magnetic susceptibility \n\nvalues, reveal synchronous oscillations of the content of ferrimagnetic minerals with coarser \n\ngranulometry and high amounts of paramagnetic minerals. The changes between the intervals denote \n\ndifferent environmental conditions. \n\nSpectral analyses performed for ? and ARM/IRM1T of C02 show periodicities closed to the \n\nMilankovitch orbital cycles, taking constant sedimentation rates of 1 cm/kyr. For core C07, the same \n\nisn\u2019t observed (with an assumed sedimentation rate of 1.6 cm/kyr) and further research should be done. \n\nIn both cores maxima of ? and coarser magnetic carriers suggest the presence of ice-rafted debris (IRD) \n\ntransported by icebergs during the Heinrich events at low latitudes (32\u00baN). However, independent and \n\ncomplementary data, like oxygen isotopic stratigraphy, Ca/Sr ratio and Sr-Nd isotopic composition are \n\nneeded to confirm it. \n\nIn core C05, magnetic results as the absence of well defined intervals and the low and quite stable \n\nvalues of magnetic susceptibility combined with \n14\n\nC ages suggest that the core correspond to landslide. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nAssessing climatic changes through environmental magnetic analyses of three sedimentary columns of \n\nthe North Atlantic Ocean (between 29\u00baN and 35\u00baN) \n\nAna Isabel de Jesus Lopes                                                                                  26 \n\n \n\n7.
