All tested wastes are classified as non-hazardous \nand are generated in the pulp and paper process, including primary sludge, \ndregs, grits, lime mud and bottom ash (this generated in a process that \noccurs in parallel to the production of cellulose, whose aim is the production \nof energy to supply the plant through the combustion of forest biomass in \nfluidized bed). A detailed general characterization was performed at each \nwaste and according to their characteristics, they were selected some \napplications in materials with potential use, specifically in Fibercement, \nBituminous Mixture for regularization layer and industrial mortars (rendering \nmortars and cementitious-adhesive). After decided to application each \nwaste was specifically tested to proceed the setting up of formulations \ncontaining different content of waste in replacement of the raw conventional \nmaterial. As an isolated case, the bottom ash was tested not only as an \nalternative raw material for construction materials, but also it was tested for \nits use in fluidized bed in which the waste is generated as raw material. Both \ndregs and bottom ash had undergone special treatment to make possible to \nobtain a better quality of waste in order do not compromise the final product \ncharacteristics and process. The dregs were tested in bituminous mixtures \nas received and also washed (on the laboratory scale to remove soluble \nsalts) and bottom ash were washed and screened in industrial scale (for \nremoval of soluble salts, especially chlorides and coarse fraction particles \nelimination - particles larger than 1 mm size). The remaining residues form \nused in such as received avoiding additional costs. The results indicated \npotential and some limitations for each application to the use of these \nwastes as alternative raw material, but in some cases, the benefits in \nrelation to valorization overlap with its limitations in both aspects, \nenvironmental and economic. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ni \n \n\n \n\nList of Figures iv \n\nList of Tables viii \n\nPublications x \n\nList of Abreviations xiv \n\n1 Introduction 1 \n\n1.1 Motivation and Framework 3 \n1.2 Objective and Structure 3 \n1.3 Literature review 6 \n\n1.3.1 Waste management 6 \n1.3.2 Pulp and paper mill 7 \n\n1.3.2.1 Chemical recovering and causticizing wastes 12 \n1.3.2.2 Biosludges 13 \n\n1.3.3 Biomass heat and power plants 14 \n\n1.3.3.1 Fluidised bed combustion technology 15 \n1.3.3.2 Ashes from forest biomass combustion 18 \n\n1.3.4 Construction materials as a waste management solution 19 \n\n1.4 Legal Procedures 23 \n\n1.4.1 Main Steps of simplified licensing process 24 \n1.4.2 Specification according to Ordinance n.\u00ba 1023/2006 25 \n\n2 Experimental work 29 \n\n2.1 Experimental Methods 31 \n\n2.1.1 Physical characterization 31 \n2.1.2 Chemical and mineralogical characterization 32 \n2.1.3 Sample characterization methods for specific applications 34 \n\n2.2 Pilot scale combustion facility 36 \n2.3 Industrial scale test 39 \n\n3 Construction materials as a waste management solution for cellulose sludge 43 \n\n3.1 Introduction 45 \n3.2 Experimental 46 \n\n3.2.1 Materials 47 \n3.2.2 Methods 47 \n\n3.3 Results and discussion 52 \n\n3.3.1 Process and environmental control 52 \n3.3.2 Final product control 54 \n3.3.3 Evaluation of solution sustainability 56 \n\n3.4 Conclusions 57 \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nii \n \n\n4 Pulp and paper plant wastes valorisation in bituminous mixes 59 \n\n4.1 Introduction 61 \n4.2 Experimental 62 \n\n4.2.1 Materials 63 \n4.2.2 Methods 65 \n\n4.3 Results and Discussion 67 \n\n4.3.1 Phase I 67 \n4.3.2 Phase II 70 \n4.3.3 Phase III 77 \n\n4.4 Conclusions 78 \n\n5 Lime mud from cellulose industry as raw material in cement mortars 81 \n\n5.1 Introduction 83 \n5.2 Experimental procedure 85 \n5.3 Results and discussion 87 \n\n5.3.1 Characterization of lime mud 87 \n5.3.2 Cement lime mud formulations 89 \n\n5.3.2.1 Fresh state properties 89 \n5.3.2.2 Hardened state properties 91 \n\n5.4 Conclusions 94 \n\n6 Mortar formulations with bottom ash from biomass combustion 97 \n\n6.1 Introduction 99 \n6.2 Methodology 100 \n\n6.2.1 Thermal power plant characteristics 100 \n6.2.2 Raw material characterization 101 \n6.2.3 Mortar formulation and characterization 102 \n\n6.3 Results and discussion 104 \n\n6.3.1 Materials and mixtures 104 \n6.3.2 Characterization of mortars 106 \n\n6.4 Conclusions 111 \n\n7 Bottom ash from biomass combustion in BFB and its use in adhesive-mortars 113 \n\n7.1 Introduction 115 \n7.2 Methodology 118 \n\n7.2.1 Characterization of raw BA 118 \n7.2.2 Characterization of materials used in cementitious-adhesive application 119 \n7.2.3 CAM formulations and characterization 119 \n\n7.3 Results and Discussion 123 \n\n7.3.1 Characterization of raw BA 123 \n7.3.2 Characterization of materials used in cementitious-adhesive application 129 \n7.3.3 Characterization of CAM 129 \n\n7.4 Conclusions 135 \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\niii \n \n\n8 Treatment and use of bottom bed waste in biomass fluidised bed combustors 137 \n\n8.1 Introduction 139 \n8.2 Materials and methods 141 \n\n8.2.1 Characterization of industrial bottom bed waste 141 \n8.2.2 Use of recycled bed waste (RBW) as sand bed replacement in BFBC 142 \n\n8.3 Results and Discussion 145 \n\n8.3.1 Industrial bottom bed waste 145 \n8.3.2 Use of recycled bed waste (RBW) as sand bed replacement in BFBC 150 \n8.3.3 Economic evaluation of the recirculation scenario 155 \n\n8.4 Conclusions 157 \n\n9 Practical implementation of Waste Management Solutions studied: Viability and \nLimitations 159 \n\n9.1 Wastes amounts and tested solutions 161 \n9.2 Material valorization solutions 162 \n\n9.2.1 Fiber-cement (Chapter 3) 162 \n9.2.2 Bituminous mixtures (Chapter 4) 163 \n9.2.3 Industrial Mortars (Chapters 6 and 7) 164 \n\n9.3 Concluding remarks 165 \n\n10 Conclusion and Future works 167 \n\n10.1  Conclusions 168 \n10.2  Future works 171 \n\nReferences 173 \n\nAppendix I I \n\nAppendix II XI \n\nAppendix III XXI \n\nAppendix IV XXXI \n\nAppendix V XLI \n\nAppendix VI LI \n\nAppendix VII LXVII \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\niv \n \n\nList of Figures \n\nFigure 1. 1.

Cellulose and \n\npaper mills and construction are activities that generate high environmental impacts, due to \n\nthe high consumption of water and energy, use of large amounts of non-renewable raw \n\nmaterials and generation of wastes. \n\nThe pulp and paper making industries are water intensive activities. Although the \n\nrecycling of water is increasing through the adoption of closed systems, which promote the \n\nrecirculation of process waters, the production of pulp and the manufacture of paper \n\ngenerate a considerable amount of wastewater and wastes that are purged from the process \n\n[Cabral et al., 1998; Thompson et al., 2001; Nurmesniemi et al., 2007]. Waste is gradually \n\nbecoming an increasing environmental issue of concern. Achieving the European recycling \n\ntargets defined for 2020, with the obligations about waste disposal in 2016, are the major \n\nenvironmental challenges for Southern Europe countries.  \n\nIn this work industrial wastes originated from paper pulp or cellulose production \n\nand associated biomass combustion processes, produced in large amounts annually, are \n\ncharacterised and then recycled in distinct construction and building materials. It is known \n\nthat construction industry is responsible for 30% of greenhouse gases emission while is the \n\nbiggest consumer of raw materials (approximately 3000Mt/year) [Torgal and Said, 2010]. \n\nSustainability issues are obviously associated to this activity, also because the amount of \n\nwastes produced is very significant. Considering the large amount of quarried aggregates \n\nbeing consumed, this thesis details the recycling of several wastes, through bench, pilot \n\nand industrial scales, as substitutes of primary aggregates. This way the landfilling is \n\navoided, while costs are minimized and demand of natural resources and extraction \n\nactivities are also reduced. \n\n1.2  Objective and Structure  \n\nThe general aim of this work is to contribute to the development of wastes \n\nmanagement solutions through their valorization recycling them as substitutes of natural \n\naggregates widely used in building and construction activities.  \n\nSpecific objectives were defined upon the work progressing: \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n4 \n \n\ni) Identification and characterization of wastes generated in considerable \n\namounts on paper pulp mill whose final destination is still the disposal on \n\nlandfills, as well as the potential raw materials to be replaced by some of those; \n\nii) Testing of selected recycling solutions, defining and assessing the formulations \n\nin bench scale; during this process the need for waste treatment to improve its \n\nperformance in the final application was also considered. \n\niii) After identification of an interesting waste content to be used in the final \n\nproduct tested as replacement of a primary raw material, it was verified the \n\npossibility of changing the test scale (from bench to industrial). It is important \n\nto refer that this process was limited to applications where available partners \n\nwere identified, revealing mutual interest in implementing the potential \n\nsolution verified in lab scale. \n\niv) The exhaust sand from the fluidized bed was also tested in the own generating \n\nprocess/unit. This work was developed in pilot-scale instead of industrial due \n\nto the access to available facility which permitted to control the whole process \n\nand final product. \n\nv) Finally, the wastes valorization solutions in terms of advantages and \n\nlimitations were identified and reported.   \n\n \n\nThe first chapter of this thesis describes the targeted industrial sectors, pulp and paper \n\nmill, biomass combustion technology and construction materials. This literature review \n\nalso refers the applicable legislation about the simplified licensing of waste management \n\noperations, aiming to clarify the main steps to be followed considering the legal procedures \n\nand showing how time consuming and bureaucratic this procedure is also given, to \n\nexemplify how time consuming and bureaucratic this process is.. \n\nThe experimental research that was carried out is reported in chapters 2 to 8 of this \n\ndocument. \n\n Chapter 2 describes experimental facilities used to characterize the raw materials \n\nand the wastes tested. It also describes the general procedures used to achieve the basic \n\ninformation related with the materials and wastes aiming their adequate application. \n\n Chapter 3 focuses in evaluating the use of primary sludge from kraft hardwood \n\npulping process in fiber-cement sheets production at an industrial scale. In this study, \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n5 \n \n\nparameters such as the sludge characteristics and its quality as a raw material, \n\nincorporation level, the water quality in the process and the final product characteristics \n\nwere assessed. \n\n Chapter 4 describes the procedures developed to test the possibility of using pulp \n\nand paper inorganic wastes, namely dregs and grits, in asphalt concrete mixes as aggregate \n\nreplacement in road regularization layers, through mix designs and specific \n\ncharacterization tests, contributing to reduce environmental effects of these wastes landfill \n\ndisposal, which nowadays still has been their unique management solution. \n\n Chapter 5 describes a detailed characterization of a rich calcium carbonate waste, \n\nnamed lime mud, generated in caustizing circuit of pulp mill process and its use as filler in \n\ncement-based mortars. Not only was the rheological behaviour of mortars evaluated, but \n\nalso their properties on hardened state. \n\n In chapters 6 and 7 the conventional aggregate (sand, herein named S2) used in \n\nindustrial rendering-mortars and cementitious-adhesives was substituted by bottom ash \n\nproduced from the forest residues biomass combustion in Bubbling Fluidised Bed \n\nCombustors (BFBC). The work emphasizes the biomass quality contribution in the ash \n\ncharacteristics and the need of pre-treatment procedures before substitution, namely \n\nscreening/sieving and/or washing of waste. The environmental control of the waste was \n\nalso evaluated aiming the characterization of the bottom ash to categorize the landfill class \n\naccording to Decree-Law 152/2002. \n\n Chapter 8 improves the knowledge on the characteristics of bottom bed waste from \n\nfluidized bed combustion of residual forest biomass in Portuguese thermal plants and \n\ncogeneration plants. Based on them, physical pre-treatment processes were applied aiming \n\nto regenerate the material to be reused in the bed of the bubbling fluidised bed combustor \n\nin pilot-scale equipment.  \n\nChapter 9 discusses the viability and limitations of practical implementation of some \n\nstudied solutions, in terms of materials fluxes, consumption/substitution of \n\nconventional/primary resources, and industrial processing adaptations.  \n\nFinally, the main conclusions of developed solutions are presented in chapter 10 \n\nincluding suggestions for future works which could be complement the actual \n\nachievements, particularly in defining suitable waste management operations in order to \n\nachieve sustainable solutions.  \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n6 \n \n\n1.3 Literature review \n\n1.3.1 Waste management  \n\n According to the definitions by the European Council Directive 2006/12/CE on \n\nWaste (EC, 1991), waste generally speaking shall mean any substance or object which the \n\nholder discards or intends to or is required to discard, and waste management shall mean \n\nthe collection, transport, recovery and disposal of waste, including the supervision of such \n\noperations and after-care of disposal sites. In general, one fundamental aspect of the \n\nlegislation on this question is the setting of goals for waste management [Nurmesniemi et \n\nal., 2007]. The Decree-Law  n.\u00ba 73/2011 from June 17th and transposes the European \n\nCouncil Directive 2008/98/CE related to solid wastes, expresses on its legislative framing, \n\nthe prevention of wastes, promoting its reuse and recycling to aim at extending its use in \n\nthe economy before returning to the environment in safe conditions. Besides considering \n\nimportant to promote the entire exploitation in the new organized market of wastes as a \n\nmean of consolidation the wastes valorization, with advantages for economic agents, as \n\nwell as to stimulate the use of specific wastes with high potential of valorization. The \n\nlegislation also defines requirements for substances or objects resulting from a productive \n\nprocess that can be considered as a product and not a waste. So, in a positive perspective, \n\nthe legislation defines criteria for certain solid wastes deprive the waste status, and thus \n\ncan become a resource. \n\n According to the Decree-law n.\u00ba 178/2006, industrial wastes are those ones \n\ngenerated in industrial productive processes, as well as those resultant from activities \n\nrelated with production and distribution of electricity, gas and water. \n\n The wastes recycling can represent a significant opportunity along with major \n\nchallenges. Industrial solid wastes, such as ashes from biomass combustion, construction \n\nand demolition materials, lime mud, organic and inorganic sludges from wastewater \n\ntreatment can be valuable materials for some industrial processes. Much industrial waste is \n\nneither hazardous nor toxic, such as waste wood fiber produced in several industrial sectors \n\nrelated to agriculture or forestry products. These by-products have many of the properties \n\nas the conventional materials they could replace. Putting these commodities into \n\nproductive use could save natural resources and contribute to a sustainable future. The \n\nmain principles of the waste management strategy in the European Union have been \n\nsummarized as follows: \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n7 \n \n\n- Waste management hierarchy. Waste management strategies must aim to prevent \n\nor reduce the generation of waste and decrease its noxious nature by developing clean \n\ntechnologies. In addition, efforts must be made in order to contribute, first to the \n\ndevelopment and marketing of products designed to have the smallest possible impact in \n\nterms of pollution, if any, and secondly to the development of appropriate techniques for \n\nthe final disposal of dangerous substances contained in waste destined for recovery. Where \n\nthe aforementioned strategies are not possible, or fail to be environmentally and \n\neconomically viable at the same time, waste materials should be reused, recycled or \n\nrecovered, or used as a source of energy, provided that these practices improve or, at least, \n\ndo not significantly decrease the quality of the final product. As a final option, waste \n\nshould be safely disposed of, e.g., in landfill sites; \n\n- Self-sufficiency at the community and, if possible, at Member State level. Member \n\nStates need to establish, in co-operation with other Member States, an integrated and \n\nadequate network of waste disposal facilities, taking into account geographical \n\ncircumstances or the need for specialized installations for certain types of waste; \n\n- Best available techniques not entailing excessive cost.  Emissions from installations \n\nto the environment should be reduced as much as possible and in the most economically \n\nefficient way;  \n\n- Proximity. Wastes should be disposed of as close to the source as possible, by \n\nmeans of the most appropriate methods and technologies in order to ensure a high level of \n\nenvironmental and public health protection; \n\n- Producer responsibility. Particularly, manufacturers have to be involved in closing \n\nthe life cycle of their products, from production and throughout their useful life, until they \n\nfinally become waste.  \n\n- The principle of the protection of primary resources: it is formulated in the wider \n\ncontext of sustainable development, and it underlines the need to minimize and enhancing \n\nefficiency in the use of primary resources, particularly non-renewable resources, with an \n\nemphasis on the use of secondary raw materials. \n\n- The substitution principle: emphasizes the need to replace dangerous raw materials \n\nby non-dangerous raw materials, thus avoiding hazardous waste arising. \n\n1.3.2  Pulp and paper mill \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n8 \n \n\n Europe hosts over nine hundred pulp and paper mills, playing an important role in a \n\nglobal perspective. The pulp and paper industry comprises companies that use wood as raw \n\nmaterial and produce pulp, paper, card board and other cellulose-based products.  This \n\nindustry is dominated by north American (United States and Canada), northern European \n\n(Finland, Sweden, and North-West Russia) and east Asian countries (such as East Siberian \n\nRussia, China, Japan, and South Korea). Australasia and Brazil also have relevant \n\npositions. The United States had been the world's leading producer of paper until 2009, \n\nwhen it was overtaken by China [RISI, 2011]. The pulp and paper industry is an important \n\nproducer of solid wastes. However, there is a growing trend towards the utilization of their \n\nsolid wastes and industrial by-products in different sectors aiming their environmental \n\ncompatible and sustainable valorization. The difficulties found, not only in terms of viable \n\napplications but also related with bureaucracies, make industrial solid wastes valorization a \n\nchallenge for producers and end users. Considerable research is being conducted \n\nworldwide on the use of waste materials in order to avoid an increasing toxic threat to the \n\nenvironment or to simplify present waste disposal techniques, by making them more \n\nreasonable [Ahmaruzzaman, 2010]. Through the increasing use of recycled paper, the \n\nincreased degree of water treatment, more restrictive legislation and increasing costs of \n\nsolid wastes landfill, the pulp and paper industry has been forced to place more and more \n\nemphasis on waste management. Often, the solid wastes from one stage of the productive \n\nprocess can be used as resource in other processes. Nurmesniemi et al (2007) exemplified \n\nthat for the bark and wood wastes produced during the sawmilling process, which can be \n\nused as a raw material for particle board and chemical pulp production. Furthermore, \n\nthermal energy can be produced by burning wood waste from the debarking plant, black \n\nliquor from the pulp making process, and biosludge from wastewater treatment plants (i.e., \n\nactivated sludge plants). In addition, the fiber sludge from pulp and paper mills, and \n\ntherefore also called paper mill sludge [Niutanen and Korhonen, 2002], is increasingly \n\nbeing utilized in the hydraulic barrier layer of landfills. The fly ash from the biomass \n\nthermal power plants (nowadays, usually fluidized bed boilers) can be used as an additive \n\nin earthwork construction to improve soil strength and to reduce deformation, or as a forest \n\nfertilizer, ceramic composite, or yet as a binder replacing material in cement mortars \n\n[Harila and Kivilinna, 1999; Jordan et al., 2002; Mroueh and Wahstr\u00f6m, 2002; Hyt\u00f6nen, \n\n2003; Rajamma et al., 2009]. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n9 \n \n\n  Nevertheless, these and other types of solid wastes and by-products from the pulp \n\nand paper mills are often regarded as waste, without economic value and with inherent \n\nmanagement costs, although there is an increasing interest in using them as resources. \n\nMakkonen et al. (2002) reported that materials which are used or that potentially could be \n\nutilized in several applications should not actually be classified as a waste.  \n\nPulping is the process of separating individual fibres from wood chips or recycled \n\npaper by either chemical, semichemical, or mechanical methods. The chemical process is \n\nthe most common for wood chips. Wood handling is the first step in the pulping process. In \n\nthis step, wood logs are debarked and cut into pieces showing manageable sizes. Wood, the \n\nmajor raw material used in the pulp and paper industry, is basically composed of cellulose \n\nfibres, carbohydrates such as starch and sugar, and lignin, which acts as adhesive substance \n\nfor the cellulose fibres [Nurmesniemi et al., 2007]. Paper is essentially a sheet of fibres \n\nwith a number of added chemicals that affect the properties and quality of the sheet. \n\nBesides fibres and chemicals, manufacturing of pulp and paper requires a large amount of \n\nprocess water and energy in the form of steam and electric power. Consequently, the main \n\nenvironmental issues associated with pulp and paper production are emissions to water, \n\nemissions to air and energy consumption [IPPC, 2001]. \n\n Chemical pulping is dominated by two processes \u2013 the sulphate and the sulphite \n\nprocess. In the sulphate process, which involves alkaline digestion, the active cooking \n\n(digesting) chemicals are sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium sulphide (Na2S). This \n\nprocess is commonly named as Kraft method (Figure 5.1), and promotes the wood chips \n\ndelignification into pulp for papermaking, while preserving the long fibers in the resulting \n\nstrong pulp (composed by around 50 to 60% fibers). The sulphate or kraft process is the \n\ndominating pulping process worldwide, due to the superior strength properties of the \n\nproduced pulp and its versatility to digest distinct (all) wood species. This process has \n\noperating interdependent units (wood storage park, cooking, laundering, thermoelectricity \n\netc.) in which intermediate products are manufactured (shavings, raw pulp, bleached pulp, \n\nenergy, etc.). \n\n The pulp and paper industry is a source of a wide range of solid wastes. Nearly \n\neleven million tonnes of waste are produced yearly by the European pulp and paper \n\nindustry [Monte et al., 2009]. The amount and the composition of the solid wastes depend \n\non the pulp/paper grade produced, the raw materials used, the applied processing \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n10 \n \n\ntechniques, and the final quality/properties of the pulp/paper. Sludges (primary and \n\nbiological/secondary) from the wastewater treatment, lime mud, lime slaker grits, dregs \n\nfrom the green liquor washing, ashes and sand from the combustion of organic components \n\nin co-generation units, and wood processing residues, are the main wastes produced. \n\nFigure 1.1 shows a scheme of the production process of bleached Kraft pulp, emphasizing \n\nthe steps where the mentioned wastes are generated. They are better described in the \n\nfollowing sections of this chapter. Under normal running conditions, wastes characteristics \n\nare roughly constant, excepting the sludges that might show widely variable properties, \n\ndepending on the type of operations carried out at the mill. \n\n The wastes can be reused and valorised in a safe and environmental way, \n\nminimizing the use of landfills as the final destination. In fact, in countries such as \n\nGermany, Spain and Netherlands, certain waste streams cannot be disposed of at landfill \n\nsites. And as it was previously stated, current legislation and increased landfilling taxes \n\nstimulates the search for novel management methods of such wastes, favouring reusing \n\nalternatives [Monte et al., 2009]. More efficient techniques to separate, collect and \n\nproperly store some waste fractions at source can be also beneficial to meet this aim [IPPC, \n\n2010]. For economic and environmental reasons, chemical and semi-chemical pulp mills \n\nemploy chemical recovery processes to reclaim spent cooking chemicals from the pulping \n\nprocess. At kraft pulp mills, spent cooking liquor, referred as \u201cweak black liquor,\u201d from the \n\nbrown stock washers is routed to the chemical recovery area at kraft pulp mills. The \n\nchemical recovery process involves: (i) concentration of weak black liquor; (ii) combustion \n\nof organic compounds; (iii) reduction/elimination of inorganic compounds (dregs); and (iv) \n\nreconstitution of the cooking liquor. The chemical recovery process involves several steps \n\nthat are described in the following subitems.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n11 \n \n\n \nFigure 1. 1. Simplified scheme of integrated pulp mill and respective solid wastes. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n12 \n \n\n1.3.2.1 Chemical recovering and causticizing wastes \n\n The residual weak black liquor from the digesting process is a diluted solution \n\n(approximately 12 to 15 percent solids of total weight) of wood lignin, organic materials, \n\noxidized inorganic compounds (sodium sulphate [Na2SO4], Na2CO3), and non-reactive \n\ninitial white liquor (Na2S and NaOH). The recovery of the black liquor starts with a \n\nconcentration step, conducted through a series of multiple-effect evaporators (MEEs) that \n\nincrease the solids content up to about 50 percent. At this stage the so called \u201cstrong black \n\nliquor\u201d is formed. This liquor is either oxidized in the black liquor oxidation (BLO) system \n\nif it is further concentrated in a direct contact evaporator (DCE) or routed directly to a non-\n\ndirect contact evaporator (NDCE), also called a concentrator. Oxidation of the black liquor \n\nprior to evaporation in a DCE reduces emissions of odorous total reduced sulphur (TRS) \n\ncompounds, which are stripped from the black liquor in the DCE when it contacts the hot \n\nflue gases from the recovery furnace. The solids content of the black liquor after the \n\nevaporator/concentrator typically reaches 65 to 68 percent total weight. The concentrated \n\nblack liquor is then sprayed into the recovery furnace, where the organic components are \n\ncombusted, and the Na2SO4 is reduced to Na2S. This process is strongly exothermic and the \n\navailable energy is recovered as steam for process requirements, such as wood chips \n\ncooking, black liquor heating and evaporation, preheating of combustion air, and drying of \n\npulp or paper products. Energy requirements are often supplemented by fossil fuel burning \n\nand/or wood firing on accessory boilers. Particulate matter (PM) (primarily Na2SO4) \n\nexiting the furnace with the hot flue gases is collected in an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) \n\nand added to the black liquor to be fired in the recovery furnace. \n\n Additional makeup Na2SO4, or \u201csaltcake,\u201d should also be added to the black liquor \n\nprior to firing. Molten inorganic salts, referred to as \u201csmelt,\u201d are collected in a char bed at \n\nthe bottom of the furnace. The smelt is drawn off and dissolved in water in the smelt \n\ndissolving tank (SDT) to form a solution of carbonate-rich salts called \u201cgreen liquor,\u201d \n\nwhich is primarily constituted by Na2S and Na2CO3. The green liquor also contains \n\ninsoluble unburned carbon and inorganic impurities, named dregs (ELW: 030302), which \n\nare removed in a series of clarification tanks [Martins et al., 2007; Modolo et al., 2010; \n\nMahmonoudkhani M., 2005]. \n\n Decanted green liquor is transferred to the causticizing area, where the Na2CO3 is \n\nconverted to NaOH by the addition of lime (calcium oxide [CaO]). The green liquor is first \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n13 \n \n\ntransferred to a slaker tank, where CaO from the lime kiln reacts with water to form \n\ncalcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2]. \n\nCaO + H2O ? Ca(OH)2 + Heat [R1] \n\n From the slaker, liquor flows through a series of agitation tanks, referred to as \n\ncausticizers, that allow the causticizing reaction to go to completion (i.e., Ca(OH)2 reacts \n\nwith Na2CO3 to form NaOH and calcium carbonate [CaCO3]). \n\nCa(OH)2 + Na2CO3 ? 2NaOH + CaCO3? [R2] \n\n Insoluble removed from the slakers are denominated grits (ELW: 030302). \n\n The causticizing products are then routed to the white liquor clarifier, which CaCO3 \n\nprecipitates are removed, being named \u201clime mud (ELW: 030309)\u201d. The lime mud is \n\nwashed in the mud washer to remove the last traces of sodium. The washed mud is then \n\ndried and calcined in the lime kiln to produce \u201creburned\u201d lime, which is reintroduced in to \n\nthe slaker. The mud washer filtrate, known as weak liquor, is used in the SDT to dissolve \n\nthe smelt. The white liquor (NaOH and Na2S) from the clarifier is recycled to the digesters \n\nin the pulping area of the mill. \n\n In the kraft pulping and chemical recovery processes, carbon dioxide from biomass \n\ncombustion is emitted to the atmosphere but the major part is dissolved/captured in the \n\nrecovery furnace, forming Na2CO3 that exits in the smelt. Later on, the conversion of \n\nNa2CO3 into new pulping chemicals involves the transference of carbonate ions to CaCO3 \n\nin the causticizing process. Only in the lime kiln, where CaCO3 is converted to CaO, CO2 \n\nis released to the atmosphere [EPA, 2009c]. \n\n In summary, grits, dregs and lime mud are the inorganic wastes generated in \n\nchemicals recovery process, being normally landfilled after dewatering (see Figure 5.1). \n\n1.3.2.2 Biosludges \n\n The pulp and paper production is a water-intensive activity. Although the recycling \n\nof water is increasing through the adoption of closed systems, which promote the \n\nrecirculation of processing water, running units generate a considerable amount of organic \n\nrich wastewater that is purged from the process [Nurmesniemi et al., 2007; Cabral et al., \n\n1998; Thompson et al., 2001]. Before discharge, the wastewater usually undergoes primary \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n14 \n \n\nand secondary treatments. The primary stage is basically a sedimentation operation that is \n\nrunned in a clarifier tank, aiming to remove suspended solids from the effluents. It is in this \n\nstage where primary sludge (ELW: 030310) (Figure 1.2) is generated. This primary \n\nsludge is basically composed of wood fibres and inorganic impurities like sand, and \n\ncalcium carbonate. Primary treatment can also lead to a reduction of the biological oxygen \n\ndemand (BOD) [Nurmesniemi et al., 2007; P\u00f6yki\u00f6 et al., 2004].  \n\n \nFigure 1. 2. Illustration of the primary effluent treatment flowsheet. \n\n The secondary process is a biological treatment in which micro-organisms are used \n\nto reduce the amount of organic pollutants and BOD in the liquid effluent [P\u00f6yki\u00f6 et al., \n\n2004]. The secondary sludge consists of the microbial biomass, as well as a small fraction \n\nof inorganic constituents, including macro-nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) \n\nand micro-nutrients (iron, zinc, and other metals). \n\n1.3.3  Biomass heat and power plants \n\n Recently, pressures on global environment and energy security have led to an \n\nincreasing demand on renewable energy sources, and diversification of Europe\u2019s energy \n\nsupply. In 2010, an overall ?2200GWh of electricity was produced in Portugal from \n\nbiomass combustion (excluding MSW and biogas) [DGEG, 2013], which corresponds to \n\nGradating    ?     Neutralisation  ?   Primary clarifier\n\nPrimary sludge\n\nInfluent\n\nFilter press (dehydration) \n\nMixing tank\n\nStorage or transportation \n\nElimination or valorisation\n\nPulp mill       \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n15 \n \n\nabout 4% of the gross electricity generation in the country. Of this, about 1580GWh \n\ncorresponds to electricity produced in combined heat and power (CHP) plants running by \n\nunits of this industrial sector, mainly using black liquors (>80% of fuel feed [Patrao, \n\n2011]) and eucalyptus bark and the remaining 610GWh were generated in dedicated \n\nthermal power plants, using essentially forest residues from eucalyptus and pine plantations \n\n(tops, barks, branches) and agricultural by-products. Those devoted power plants represent \n\n?105MWe total installed capacity [Patr\u00e3o, 2011; Monteiro et al., 2012; AIFF, 2009; \n\nSantos, 2011; APREN, 2010], and more than 50% is owned by EDP Bioelectrica [Patr\u00e3o, \n\n2011]. The Portuguese Government objective for 2020 is an overall 250MWe of installed \n\nelectric power  generation from forest biomass residues, in which the new dedicated plants \n\nwill have capacities typically below 20MWe [AIFF, 2010; APREN, 2010]. \n\nBiofuels, or biomass-derived fuels, are widely employed nowadays. They can exert \n\nan important role, since are considered renewable and CO2 neutral energy resources, once \n\nthe consumption rate is lower than the growth rate of the plants, and can potentially \n\nprovide energy for heat, power and transports from the same installation [Pingoud &amp; \n\nLehtila, 1997; Tarnawski, 2004]. \n\n Portugal encloses an important potential of renewable energy resources in terms of \n\nbiomass \u2013 forest residues and wood waste. The use of biomass to energy has other \n\nadvantages beyond the reduction on greenhouse gases from using fossil fuel combustion \n\nand the decrease of the external dependence on energy. Fire risks are also reduced by forest \n\ncleaning and removal of combustible wastes. To utilize this potential, the Portuguese \n\nGovernment, already in 1990, inquired EDP [Energy of Portugal, S.A], to implement and \n\nmanage a thermal power plant, in which the input would be the forestry biomass residues. \n\nCBE (Portuguese Centre of Biomass to Energy) performed the studies and chose locations \n\nto implement the thermal power plant, considering regions having thick forested areas. \n\nAnother important reason for the location choice was the number of wood industries \n\nnearby, namely sawmills, which produce wood residues such as bark.  \n\n1.3.3.1 Fluidised bed combustion technology \n\n At industrial scale, the available biomass combustion  technologies often evolved \n\nfrom technologies designed for coal combustion with temperatures ranging from about \n\n750\u00baC to well above 1000\u00baC. The widely used technologies for large-scale biomass \n\ncombustion are stationary grates (up to 5MWth), moving/vibrating grates (many in range \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n16 \n \n\nof 20-50MWth) and fluidized beds (typically within 10-100MWth) [Larsson et al., 2010; \n\nEdvardsson et al., 2006]. All of them are relatively simple to operate and can use a wide \n\nrange of fuels of varying moisture and particle sizes. These combustion systems are \n\ncommonly used as boilers to produce steam for different purposes. The solid biomass \n\ncombustion in fluidised bed and grate furnace is a proven technology for heat and power \n\nproduction [Ferraris et al., 2009; Yin et al., 2008]. \n\n Fluidised bed combustion (FBC) has been used and widely researched due to its \n\neconomic potential and lower environmental impact. It is adaptable for burning low-grade \n\ncoals, biomass and organic wastes, and thereby mixtures of them [Tarelho LAC, 2001; Van \n\nLoo &amp; Koppejan, 2008]. The fluidised bed combustion systems have been applied since \n\n1960 for burning municipal solid wastes and distinct industrial wastes. Since then, \n\ncommercial installations have been built worldwide [Van Loo &amp; Koppejan, 2008]. In \n\nPortugal, the first steps in implementing this technology were done just over the last 20 \n\nyears, to produce energy from wastes of the pulp and paper sectors (in Caima pulp and \n\npaper industry), and to combust tires [Tarelho LAC (2001]. Nowadays, Portugal has eleven \n\nplants operating with fluidised bed technology. \n\n The fluidized bed combustion boiler is suitable for bark and wood residues (e.g., \n\nwood chips, sawdust) from wood-handling processes, as well as to burn biosludge \n\ngenerated in activated sludge plants [Harila &amp; Kivilinna, 1999]. Energy generation from \n\nthis type of biomass has been referred as sustainable and environmentally friendly \n\nalternative to other energy production process based on fossil fuels. The utilization of some \n\nof these biomass wastes as an energy source can be beneficial considering effects on \n\ncarbon balances in ecosystems [Pingout &amp; Lehtila, 1997; Tarnawski, 2004]. During \n\nfluidised bed combustion (FBC) the temperature has to be kept low (usually 650\u2013900\u00b0C) in \n\norder to prevent ash sintering in the bed. Even so, this kind of technology presents high \n\nfuel conversion efficiency [McKendry, 2002; Khan et al., 2009]. This fact is also relevant \n\nwhen the environmental aspects in terms of solid wastes are considered.  \n\n Some problems associated with biomass combustion in FBC are related with the \n\nash amount and properties, both in the thermal conversion process itself (for example, \n\nslagging, fouling, corrosion, bed agglomeration), and also the environmental management \n\nof the ashes [Rajamma et al., 2009; Werkelin et al., 2010]. There are two types of fluidised \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n17 \n \n\nbed combustion technologies, bubbling (BFB) and circulating (CFB). Figure 1. 3 presents a \n\nscheme of these types of FBC in terms of material fluxes.  \n\nIn the fluidised bed technology the primary combustion air enters the furnace from \n\nbelow through the air distributor and fluidizes the bed so that it becomes a seething mass of \n\nparticles and bubbles [Mitsui Babcock Ltd., 1997; Van Loo &amp; Koppejan, 2003]. In the \n\nBFB system, the fluidization velocity of air varies between 1.0 and 2.0 m/s, while in the \n\ncirculating fluidised bed (CFB) this velocity changes between 5.0 to 10 m/s. Sand particles \n\nfor CFB systems are smaller in size (0.2 to 0.4mm diameter) than those used in BFB \n\nboilers (0.5 to 1.0mm). This means that CFB boilers work under stronger turbulent \n\nregimes, what stimulates the heat transfer and assures a homogeneous temperature \n\ndistribution [Van Loo &amp; Koppejan, 2003]. \n\nAnyway, both types show the following attributes: high flexibility concerning \n\nmoisture content and kind of biomass fuels; burning under a low excess of oxygen raises \n\nthe efficiency and decreases the flue gas flow; there are no moving parts in the hot \n\ncombustion chamber; and NOx emissions are reduced by air staging. In terms of \n\ndisadvantages we might refer high investment and operating costs; low tolerance in \n\nchanges of size distribution of bed particles; tendency for bed agglomeration, especially \n\nwhen burning strongly alkaline fuels; need to manage the exhaust bed particles.  \n\n \nFigure 1. 3. Bubbling and Circulating fluidised bed combustion technologies for biomass and particles \n\ndistribution system.

Two different fly ash fractions are normally distinguished: multi-cyclone \n\nfly ash and filter fly ash. According to van Loo &amp; Koppejan (2003), multi-cyclone fly ash \n\nis fine when compared with bottom ash. They are mainly composed of inorganic ash \n\nparticles carried with the flue gas and precipitated in the secondary combustion zone, in the \n\nboiler and especially in multi-cyclones placed downstream the boiler. The ash fraction \n\nfrom multi-cyclone consists of coarse fly ash particles. Filter fly ash is finer than multi-\n\ncyclone fly ash. The filter fly ash is collected in electrostatic filters, fibrous filters or is \n\ncondensed as sludge in flue gas condensation units, normally placed downstream the multi-\n\ncyclone. The fly ash collected during fluidised bed combustion of biomass is classified as \n\nindustrial waste, with code 100101 according to the European List of Wastes code. \n\n The bottom ash is a waste generated upon periodic bed discharges in a FBC, \n\nrequired to assure bed renovation and to avoid agglomeration and consequent \n\ndefluidization, as well as to maintain the bed height and the suitable particle size \n\ndistribution. Those parameters are crucial to guarantee proper hydrodynamic conditions of \n\nthe bubbling bed. Bottom ash consists of solid coarse particles predominantly irregular in \n\nshape and mostly siliceous in nature (quartz) with organic impurities. They are composed \n\nby the sand particles fed purged from the original bed, inorganic (soil and small stones) \n\ncomponents of the fed and the biomass unburnt fraction. The bottom ash generated during \n\nbiomass combustion in fluidised bed combustion is classified as industrial waste, with code \n\n100124 according to the European List of Wastes. \n\n According to some authors [Rajamma et al, 2009; Van Loo &amp; Koppejan., 2003; \n\nWerther et al., 2000; Demirbas, 2005] the biomass combustion technology influences the \n\namount and characteristics of the ash produced in a power plant. In grate furnaces the \n\nbiomass ashes are subjected to higher temperatures (the maximum fuel bed temperature \n\ncan be as high as 1000\u20131200 \u00baC) in comparison to a fluidised bed (less than 900\u00baC). In \n\nconsequence, this influences the amount of organic species, several salts and heavy metals \n\nthat volatilize in the furnace, and consequently the composition of the ashes. As already \n\nreferred the ashes characteristics are also influenced by the biomass type and containing \n\nimpurities, the residence time and, mainly, the bed temperature (low temperatures might \n\ncause incomplete burning and the amount of organic particles tend to increase in the ash). \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n19 \n \n\n The siliceous nature (prevalence of quartz) of the bottom ash makes it a candidate \n\nto replace natural aggregates in the construction sector, replacing calibrated sand for \n\ninstance in industrial mortars. Natural aggregate consists of manufactured crushed stone \n\nand sand created by crushing bedrock, or naturally occurring unconsolidated sand and \n\ngravel. It is a major component of the most used construction materials, such as asphalt and \n\nconcrete [Bleischwitz and Bahn-Walkowiak, 2006]. This subitem specifies some \n\nenvironmental considerations about the construction sector, including potential impacts of \n\nextraction and processing of aggregates. During combustion, most of the inorganic \n\nnutrients and trace elements in the wood are retained in the ash [Steenari &amp; Linqvist, \n\n1997]. Once the biomass is burned in the furnace, the heavy metals from the fuel becoming \n\nconcentrated in the ash; the various ash fractions such as bottom ash, cyclone fly-ash, filter \n\nfly-ash and exit flue gas particles may contain relatively high concentrations of heavy \n\nmetals [Narodoslawsky &amp; Obernberger, 1996; Obernberger et al., 1997; Fujimori et al., \n\n2004].  Generally, biomass ashes are composed of the biomass nutrients, as for example \n\nCa, K, Na, Si and P. In case of wood biomass, the alkali metals content is high compared to \n\nsilicon content (i.e., rice husks) [Thy et al., 2006; Masia et al., 2007].  \n\n1.3.4 Construction materials as a waste management solution \n\n Worldwide, the construction industry consumes more raw materials (around 3000 \n\nMt/year, almost 50% in mass) than any other economic activity, which shows its potential \n\nto become an unsustainable activity [Torgal e Jalali, 2010]. The Council International \n\nBuilding (CIB) defined in 1994 the 7 principles for sustainable construction, whose first \n\ntwo are described as the \"Decreasing consumption of resources\" and \u201cReuse of the \n\nresources\u201d [Kibert, 2008]. \n\n Every year more than 1m3 of concrete is produced per person worldwide [Scrivener \n\nand Kirkpatrick, 2008] with Portland cement being the key ingredient, but producing the \n\ngreatest environmental burden. Presently around 3 billion tons of Portland cement are \n\nconsumed worldwide [Zampini, 2009] and for the production of every 1 ton of cement, \n\napproximately 800 kg of carbon dioxide is released [Ban and Ramli, 2011], around 5\u20138% \n\nof all manmade CO2 [Flatt et al., 2012]. While cement production is still based on the \n\nOrdinary Portland type (OPC), in the last few decades several other types started to be \n\nproduced using supplementary cementitious materials to partially replace the clinker [Ali et \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n20 \n \n\nal., 2008]. Anyway, in concrete and alphalt formulations the aggregates correspond to the \n\nhighest volume fraction. Ready-mixed concrete is made of up to 80% aggregates, while \n\npre-cast products and asphalt might contain 95% aggregates [Bleischwitz and Bahn-\n\nWalkowiak, 2006]. The environmental impacts caused by aggregates extraction and \n\nprocessing include changes in the landscape, noise due to vehicle movements from the pit \n\nor quarry, dust, vibrations from blasting, and degradation of groundwater and surface \n\nwater. In that sense, the use of alternative supplementary materials might assure the \n\nfollowing benefits: (1) reduction of the consumption of non-renewable natural resources; \n\n(2) reduction of energy consumption and emissions of greenhouse gases; (3) landfilling \n\nreduction [Frederico and Chidiac, 2009]. \n\n To design effective recycling solutions it is desirable to combine multidisciplinary \n\nskills. The properties of the raw materials and how they affect the behaviour of the final \n\nproducts, such as mortars, fibercement, bricks, etc, should be known. Chemical and \n\nphysical characteristics need to be defined, while determination of effects on the \n\nmechanical performance and durability of the products is a crucial requirement to estimate \n\nthe viability of the suggested recycling route. But at the same time, environmental issues \n\nneed to be accomplished. \n\n Next paragraphs will describe some examples of the use of wastes as replacement \n\nmaterial in several types of construction materials. The use of pozzolanic wastes or by-\n\nproducts in mortar formulations goes back a few thousand years ago. The Thera volcano \n\neruption in 1500 BC, which destroyed part of the island Santorini, was responsible for the \n\nappearance of vast amounts of ash which were used by Greek civilization in mortar \n\nformulations. The pozzolanic reactivity is the ability of the material to chemically combine \n\nwith the calcium hydroxide. It is a complex property that depends on the chemical \n\ncomposition of the material, namely their silica and alumina contents, on the (low) degree \n\nof crystallinity, and on the particle size distribution [Gjorv, 1992; Liu, 1998]. \n\nIn the cement industry both the material and energy contents contained in certain \n\npulp and paper residues can be recovered. Sludges from primary clarifiers (or mixed with \n\nsludge from biological treatment) might be used as clinker components [Ahmadi and Al-\n\nKhaja, 2001; Cernec et al., 2005]. However, its suitability depends on the amount and type \n\nof inorganic compounds present in the material. The primary sludge is collected in a wet \n\ncondition (about 50% moisture content) and need to be dried before addition to the clinker \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n21 \n \n\nmeal. Existing pre-dryers on the cement kilns might be used to reduce the moisture content \n\ndown to 10\u201315%. Thus, when burning the dried sludge in the cement rotary kilns, the \n\ncalorific value of the organic substances will reduce energy requirements in the calcination \n\nstage. The resulting ash will then compose the clinker [IPPC, 2001].  \n\nRavina (1997) researched the utilization of large quantities of Class F fly ash of \n\nmarginal quality in structural concrete as partial fine sand replacement. He studied the \n\neffect of such replacement on the properties of fresh [Ravina, 1997] and hardened [Ravina, \n\n1998] concrete. Results showed beneficial effects on the workability and on the \n\ncompressive strength of structural concrete and, while elasticity modulus was improved. \n\nThe fineness of the ash explained that behaviour, since compactness was improved.  \n\nAndi\u00e7 et al (2005) investigated the effect of low-lime fly ash (conforming to \n\nrelevant Turkish standard) on the mechanical properties of tile adhesives. Formulations \n\nwere prepared by partially substituting cement or sand by the waste. Cement replacement \n\nby fly ash in all levels (from 5 to 25%wt) induces reduction on the flexural and \n\ncompressive strength in all studied ages. By contrast, ash for sand substitution, at \n\npercentages up to 10 wt%, did not affect much the tensile adhesion strength of the material. \n\nA good correlation between changes on the tensile adhesion, flexural and compressive \n\nstrength values and fly ash for cement replacement content was observed.  \n\nAndrade et al (2009) discussed through experimental results, the influence of the \n\nuse of coal bottom ash as a replacement for natural fine aggregates on some properties of \n\nconcrete. They studied the influence of the bottom ash porosity on the potential water \n\nabsorption and water loss of the material, as well as on the water consumption of concretes \n\nproduced with bottom ash. The results showed that in the fresh state the concretes \n\nproduced with the bottom ash are susceptible to water loss by bleeding and the higher the \n\npercentage of bottom ash used as a natural sand replacement the lower the deformation \n\nthrough plastic shrinkage. The results also showed that the setting time is affected by the \n\npresence of bottom ash in the concrete. This study concluded that different forms of bottom \n\nash mix result in concretes with different properties in the fresh state, but the behavioural \n\ntendencies are maintained when bottom ash is employed as a replacement for natural \n\naggregates. \n\n Typically, ashes from biomass combustion have more alkali (i.e. Na and K) and \n\nless alumina than coal ashes [Llorente and Garcia, (2006); Thy et al., 2006]. According to \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n22 \n \n\nEtiegni (1990) wood ash in Europe had been used as a feedstock in the manufacture of \n\nPortland cement. Almost ten years later, Naik (1999) reported that wood ash had a \n\nsubstantial potential for use as a pozzolanic mineral admixture and activator in cement-\n\nbased materials. He further indicated that wood ash has significant potential for use in \n\nnumerous other materials including controlled low strength materials (CLSMs), low- and \n\nmedium-strength concrete, masonry products, role compacted concrete pavements, \n\nmaterials for road base, and blended cements. Due to high carbon content in wood ash, its \n\nuse is limited to low- and medium-strength concrete materials [Siddique, 2012].  \n\n Rajamma et al. (2009) studied the incorporation of fly ashes from forest biomass \n\ncombustion in cement based formulations. They figured out that this type of biomass is \n\nsimilar to class C fly ash to EN 450 on the basis of chemical composition and concluded \n\nthat up to 20% fly ash could be incorporated as cement replacement in cement-based \n\nmortars in order to maintain an acceptable mechanical strength. As well, Ramos et al. \n\n(2013) evaluated a wood waste ash (WWA) in mortar as a partial cement replacement \n\nmaterial to ascertain applicability in cement-mortars. They developed an extensive \n\nexperimental program carried out on mortar containing this ash to assess strength and \n\ndurability parameters (carbonation and alkali-silica-reaction) and concluded that WWA \n\nseems to be a promising pozzolanic material for partial substitution of cement (20%wt), \n\nwith no strength loss while enhancing the durability and thus contributing to sustainable \n\nconstruction. \n\n According to Sale and Lima (2010) many types of ash do not have hydraulic or \n\npozzolanic reactivity, but can be used in civil construction as inert materials. Based on the \n\nphysicochemical characterization of sugarcane bagasse ash (SBA - bottom and fly ash), \n\nmortars and concretes were produced by using such waste as sand replacement (between \n\n10 and 100%wt sand replacement). They observed that SBA can be recommended as \n\nreplacement of fine aggregate for the manufacture of artefacts and ordinary structures. \n\nSBA can be used as a partial substitute of sand in concretes made with cement slag-\n\nmodified Portland cement for structures requiring strength values up to 30 MPa.  \n\n Garcia and Sousa-Coutinho (2013) tried to assess the effects of using ground \n\nbottom ash (GWA) as cement replacement in mortars. The non-pozzolanic character of the \n\nwaste did not contribute to improve the mortar durability, so the material may be used as \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n23 \n \n\nfiller in cement-based formulations providing marginal durability loss and improving \n\nstrength at later ages. \n\n In bricks production, the addition of 5\u201315% of paper sludge as raw material will \n\nimprove the porosity of the fired matrix, then reducing the weight and improving the \n\nthermal insulation. Heat released due to burning of organic components will save energy \n\nupon firing. The product tends to be more resistant to cracking during drying and firing \n\nstages, but mechanical resistance diminished [Cernec and Zule, 2005; Cernec et al., 2005]. \n\n Demir (2005) investigated the potential utilization of wastes from kraft pulp \n\nproduction, namely sludge basically composed by short cellulose fibers (primary sludge), \n\nin clay bricks. Results were somewhat similar to the ones previously reported: up to 5 wt% \n\naddition, an effective pore forming effect was observed in the clay bodies, while the \n\nmechanical properties are acceptable. The control of extrusion conditions of green bodies \n\nis also easily achieved, by increasing the water content in the mixture to adjust the \n\nplasticity level. \n\n1.4 Legal Procedures \n\nThere is a clear need for guidelines to a sustainable management of solid wastes in \n\norder to enhance and to establish practices of correct management of these by-products. \n\nFor that, it seems important to characterize for knowing and controlling these wastes \n\nproperties and qualities focusing on their application/recycling as alternative to landfilling, \n\nthus saving natural resources as well. Some aspects related with bureaucratic process \n\n(licenses, dispatch notes, charters etc) many times subject the all process that occurs from \n\nindustrial preliminary tests until the solution implementation. In Portugal, at least three \n\nentities are involved in the request of simplified licensing process for waste management: \n\nthe applicant, the Commission of Coordination and Regional Development (CCDRs) and \n\nANR (Wastes National Authority). The standard procedure for simplified licensing of \n\nwaste management operations in Portugal includes procedures defined in the following \n\nlegislation.  \n\nDecree-Law n.\u00ba 178/2006, September 5th (Defines the general polices for waste \n\nmanagement and applies to waste management operations, including any transaction \n\ncollection, transportation, storage, category, treatment, recovery and disposal of waste and \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n24 \n \n\nthe decontamination of soils and monitoring of disposal sites following the closure of their \n\npremises). \n\nOrdinance n.\u00ba 1023/2006, September 20th - Indicates the elements that constitute \n\nthe simplified licensing request. \n\nOrdinance n.\u00ba 50/2007, January 09th - Presents the template of license for carry \n\nout waste management operations.  \n\nOrdinance n.\u00ba 209/2004, March 03rd - The European Wastes List (Decree-Law \n\nn.\u00ba 237/97, contained in this ordinance ensures harmonization of regulatory prevailing in \n\nthe identification and classification of residues while facilitating a perfect knowledge by \n\neconomic agents of the legal system to which they are subject. \n\n1.4.1 Main Steps of simplified licensing process \n\n Portugal has a specific standard which goal is to clarify and systematize the \n\norganization of simplified procedures for licensing waste management operations \n\ncoordinated by CCDR, under the writing and flow chart form \u2013 steps, content and \n\nresponsible conduct of these processes simplified licensing, according to the legislation \n\nabove referred.

Fluxogram of the simplified licensing process steps [Standard of Procedure, 2012]. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n2 EXPERIMENTAL WORK \n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n31 \n \n\n This work was planned considering three stages of development: bench scale tests, \n\npilot-experiments and industrial applications. The bench scale was considered for all \n\nwastes and applications. Tests were developed first with a general characterization wastes \n\nand raw materials, in terms of physical, chemical and mineralogical properties. Then \n\nsamples were produced and characterised, aiming to optimize the relevant properties. \n\nConsidering applications for which large-scale experimental facilities were available, in a \n\ntentative of testing process adaptations for real solutions. \n\n2.1  Experimental Methods \n\n2.1.1 Physical characterization \n\n To determine the water content of the solid samples they were dried to constant \n\nmass during at least 24h in an oven at 105\u00baC \u00b1 5. The water content was generally \n\nexpressed in total weight percent (EN 12880:2000; Characterization of sludges \u2013 \n\nDetermination of dry residue and water content). The particle density and water absorption \n\nwas determined for some solid wastes and raw-materials using the standard NP EN 1097-6: \n\n2003; the method was used to determine the density of the foundation soil, solid waste and \n\ntheir mixtures, but also to understand changes occurring during modification of the \n\ncomponents of a material. For density determination, the mass of sample was taken after \n\nbeing dried, and the volume is determined by the weight of the volume of water displaced \n\nby the dry particles in a known volume of the picnometer; the volumic mass was \n\ndetermined by the expression below:  \n\n? =\n(?? ? ?1)\n\n\t(?? ? ?\n) ? (?? ? ??)\n  \n\nWhere: \n\nM1 \u2013 picnometer mass (g) \n\nM2 - picnometer and water masses (g); \n\nM3 \u2013 picnometer and dry sample masses (g); \n\nM4 \u2013 picnometer, saturated sample and water masses (g). \n\n \n\n The particle size distribution of materials was determined by using two techniques: \n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n32 \n \n\ni) Sieving \n \n\nThe manual sieving was performed according to NP EN 933-1:2000. The used sieves \n\nwere comprehended between 25 mm and 0.63 mm. Before sieving, materials were dried at \n\n105\u00baC to remove the moisture and then to prevent the agglomeration of fine particles and \n\nclogging of the sieves. The mass used was adjusted according to the particle size \n\ncharacteristics of the material. The amount retained in different sieves was weighed. \n\nii) Laser diffraction particle size analyzer \n\n The particle size distribution of fly ashes (below 1mm) was determined on a \n\nCoulter LS 230 (Coulter Electronics, Krefeld, Germany) apparatus, equipped with PIDS \n\n(Polarization Intensity Differential Scattering). The Coulter consists of a vessel where the \n\nparticles are dispersed in a fluid. This suspension is forced through a small opening where \n\nexisting electrodes will impose an electric current. When a particle passes through the \n\nopening, there is a disturbance in the electrical current, corresponding to a sudden increase \n\nof resistance. This change is directly related with the volume of the particles, which allows \n\nthe determination of the size distribution and the mean value [Ferraris et al., 2004]. The \n\nCoulter LS 230 uses a laser of 750 nm and double Fourier lens for focusing the scattered \n\nlight on the ring-shaped detector setup. The detection range (angles) for diffraction is \n\nclaimed to be 40 nm \u2013 2000 \u00b5 m, thus theoretically covering the desirable size range. \n\n The specific surface area was determined by nitrogen adsorption using a specific \n\nmethod developed by Brunnauer, Emmett and Teller, which is called by the BET method \n\n[Brunauer et al. 1938]. The equipment used was a Micromeritics Instrument Corporation \n\nmodel, Gemini 2380, working at a pressure of 763 mmHg \n\n2.1.2 Chemical and mineralogical characterization \n\n Thermal gravimetric and differential thermal analyses (TG/DTA) were performed \n\nup to 1000\u00baC/1200\u00baC with a heating rate of 10 \u00baC/min, in a simultaneous TG/DTA (STA \n\n409 EP) apparatus. The data were analyzed with software programs supplied by the \n\ninstrument. The thermo gravimetric curve was corrected for buoyancy effect, while the \n\ndifferential thermal analysis curve was corrected for baseline effect. Adjustments for \n\nbuoyancy and baseline effects were acquired in a blank run using empty crucibles.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n33 \n \n\n Thermal gravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) were performed \n\nup to 1000\u00baC/1200\u00baC with a heating rate of 10 \u00baC/min, in a simultaneous TG/DTA (STA \n\n409 EP). The data were analyzed with software programs supplied by the instrument. The \n\nthermo gravimetric (TG) curve was corrected for buoyancy effect and the differential \n\nthermal analysis (DTA) curve was corrected for baseline effect. Adjustments for buoyancy \n\nand baseline effects were acquired in a blank run using empty crucibles which were later \n\nused to run the sample in a second run, but the two experimental runs were made under \n\nidentical conditions. \n\n The chlorides content of certain solid wastes was determined by the Argentometric \n\nmethod (CHLORIDE, 4500-Cl-; Standard Methods Committee, 1997). In order to prepare \n\nthe samples for the analysis, 100 g of dried material is dissolved in 1 liter of distilled water, \n\nwhile suspension is then stirred for 24 hours. Then, 100 mL of filtered solution are titrated. \n\nChlorides are titrated with a silver nitrate solution in the presence of chromate anions. The \n\nend point is denoted by the appearance of a red colour corresponding to the formation of \n\nsilver nitrate. By decreasing the pH value, silver chromate solubility grows up due to the \n\nprotonation of chromate anions, while at high pH values silver reacts with hydroxide \n\nanions and precipitates as AgOH and Ag2O. Both reactions interfere with the determination \n\naccuracy. So the pH of the solution is reduced to 7 by adding sulphuric acid. Potassium \n\nchromate solution is used as indicator, to create a slightly yellow colouration. It was \n\ntitrated against 0.0141M silver nitrate. At the end of the chloride precipitation as white \n\nsilver chloride, the first excess of titrate precipitates as silver chromate, which signals the \n\nend point. Corresponding reaction are given below. \n\nAg + Cl ? AgCl (s) [R5] \n\n2Ag + CrO4 ? Ag2CrO4 (s) [R6] \n\n By knowing the stoichiometry and moles consumed at the end point, the \n\namount of chlorides in an unknown sample can be determined. \n\n The chloride content on mortars (see chapters 6 and 7) was determined according to \n\nEN 1015-17:2000 (Determination of water-soluble chloride content of mortars). Ten grams \n\nof material was milled (&lt;150 \u00b5 m) and dissolved in 100 mL HNO3 solution (10% w/w), by \n\nboiling for 15 minutes. After this, the sample was filtered and washed with hot distilled \n\nwater until complete 500 mL of solution. The chloride content was determined by \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n34 \n \n\npotenciometry using a selective ionic electrode (Consort, model C860) in 50 mL of the \n\nfinal solution. \n\n The sulphate content was determined by gravimetry (SULFATE, 4500-SO4-2; \n\nignition of residue, Standard Methods Committee, 1997). Samples were dried, weighed and \n\ndissolved in diluted HCl. Barium chloride solution was added in excess to precipitate \n\nbarium sulphate, and the precipitate was digested in the hot solution (between 80 \u2013 90\u00baC). \n\nThe precipitate was filtered through a filter paper which was then ignited (at 800 \u00baC for 4 \n\nhours) and completely combusted. Weight ratio between precipitate and initial sample \n\namounts corresponds to the sulphate %. The precipitation reaction is described by equation \n\nR7. \n\nBa2+ (ag) + SO4\n2- (ag) ? BaSO4 (s) [R7] \n\n Crystalline phases or mineralogy of the materials were detected by X-ray \n\ndiffraction on a RIGAKU-Geigerflex X-ray diffractometer. Analysis was performed under \n\n40 kV/30 mA, and scan mode continuous/speed-2? (min-1). A C Series; CuK? radiation is \n\nused and the angle range 2? was 10\u00ba - 80\u00ba.  \n\n The chemical characterization of the samples was performed for major and minor \n\nchemical elements by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), using a Panalytical Axios spectrometer. \n\nPrior to analysis, the samples were subjected to a grinding process in an Agatha mill, \n\nfollowed by drying at 101 \u00baC \u00b1 1 \u00baC for at least 12 hours. The chemical analysis was \n\nperformed considering: i) Loss on ignition (LOI), and ii) XRF analysis on a pressed pellet \n\npreviously prepared. For LOI determination, approximately 1.5 grams of the sample, \n\nmilled and dried, were heated to 1100 \u00baC for 3 hours in a Carbolite furnace; the LOI was \n\nobtained based on the loss of weight after the heating at 1100 \u00baC. \n\n The samples morphology was analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy - Energy \n\nDispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), using an ultra-high resolution analytical scanning \n\nelectron microscope HR-FESEM Hitachi SU-70. Optical microscopy analysis was \n\ndeveloped by microscope V (Leica EZ4 HD).  \n\n These techniques required powder as samples for analysis. To enable the \n\napplication the samples were dried and milled (700 rpm/ 5 minutes) in a fast agate mill \n\nuntil a thin powder to be obtained before testing. \n\n2.1.3 Sample characterization methods for specific applications \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n35 \n \n\nApplication in fibercement production (Chapter 3) \n\nThe Schopper-Riegler test is designed to measure the rate of drainage of a diluted \n\npulp suspension. The drainage rate is related to the surface conditions and swelling of the \n\nfibers. It is widely used to track the changes in the drainage rate of various chemical pulps \n\nduring beating and refining. In principle, this method is applicable to all kinds of pulp in \n\naqueous suspension. However, in practice, the Schopper-Riegler test provides acceptable \n\nresults only if a sufficiently dense mat of fibres is formed on the wire screen. For this \n\nreason, the test is not recommended for some extremely short-fibred pulps, such as those \n\nobtained from well-beaten hardwoods, as most of the fibres will pass through the wire \n\nscreen, resulting in anomalous reduction of the SR number. The most reliable results are \n\nobtained within the range of 10 to 90 SR number. The SR/Pneumatic used in this study is \n\nused for the determination of drainability of pulp suspension in water. The drainability is \n\nthe measurable index of the refining degree of pulps. The refining of pulps is one of the \n\nmost important stages in the paper production process and strongly determines the sheet \n\nforming process and then the physical properties of resulting material. In this specific case, \n\nfiber-cement sheets were considered (ISO 5267/1:1999 \u2013 Pulps: Determination of \n\ndrainability - Part 1: Schopper-Riegler method). Some testing characteristics include: speed \n\nof sealing cone = 100 \u00b110 mm/s; calibrated bottom orifice = 149.0 \u00b11.0 s for 1litre of H2O \n\ndrainage chamber volume = 1000 mL; drainage area = 100 cm2; pneumatic driving \n\npressure = 2.0 kgf/cm2; measuring scales = 0-100 SR; resolution = 1 SR; air supply = 2 \n\nkgf/cm2; and air consumption = 0.1 m3/h. \n\nApplication in bituminous mixes (Chapter 4) \n\nTwo techniques were applied to determine the concentration of fine particles, here \n\nconsidered as impurities since they are basically constituted by the unwanted clay fraction, \n\nin the aggregates used as raw-materials for bituminous mixes: Methylene-blue (MB) and \n\nSand equivalent (Se). The tests were developed according to NP EN 933-9: 2000 and NP \n\nEN 933-8: 2000, respectively. In summary, the MB technique involves the determination \n\nof adsorption of such dye by a defined amount of aggregate particles. Increments of a \n\nsolution of methylene-blue are successively added to a water suspension containing the test \n\nspecimen. The adsorption of the methylene-blue solution by the sample is verified by \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n36 \n \n\nconducting test spots on filter-paper to detect the presence of free methylene-blue visually, \n\nrecognized by the presence of a halo on the spot (Figure 2.1). The volume of MB solution \n\nused to titration is registered and the results are expressed in grams of adsorbed MB per \n\nkilogram of sieved fraction assayed. \n\nIn the sand equivalent test, a sample of aggregate passing through 4.75 mm sieve \n\nand a small amount of flocculating solution are poured into a graduated cylinder and are \n\nagitated to remove the clay-like fine particles that might be present in the batch. The \n\nsample is then irrigated with additional flocculation solution to assure the complete \n\nremoval of such clay-like fraction. After a prescribed sedimentation period (the complete \n\ntest procedure is described in NP EN 933-9:2000), the height of flocculated clay fraction \n\nand the sand mass are determined. This ratio gives the sand equivalent value, and higher \n\nvalues correspond to a \u201ccleaner\u201d aggregate material. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 1. Scheme of methylene blue test. \n\n2.2  Pilot scale combustion facility \n\n The biomass combustion experiments were performed in a pilot-scale facility \n\nincluding a 30kWth fluidized bed combustor (Figure 2.1). A detailed description of the \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n37 \n \n\nexperimental work developed in this facility is presented in Chapter 8 of this thesis, \n\nincluding the set of operating conditions as well as the specific experimental procedures \n\nused during the combustion experiments. More detailed information about the pilot-scale \n\ninfrastructure can be found in several published works [Tarelho, 2001; Tarelho et al., 2004; \n\nTarelho et al., 2005; Tarelho et al., 2011].  \n\n This pilot-scale combustion facility can be divided into three main systems: the \n\nfluidized bed combustor, the gas sampling and analysis, and the control and data \n\nacquisition. The combustion reactor is a thermally insulated bubbling fluidized bed (AISI \n\n310 Stainless Steel) with overall dimensions of 0.25 m intern diameter and 3 m height. The \n\nreactor has a bed of silica sand (250 \u00b5m \u2013 710 \u00b5m particles) with a static bed height of 0.23 \n\nm, supported on a nozzle-type distributor for the primary combustion air injection as \n\nfluidizing agent, nine ports for gas sampling probes and for monitoring pressure and \n\ntemperature along the reactor height (three of which inside the bed), ports for \n\ncharging/discharging of bed solids, as well as specific ports accommodating a variety of \n\ndevices: an auxiliary gas burner, a zirconia cell for in-situ O2 monitoring, a port for the fuel \n\nfeeding, a port for the secondary combustion air supply, and water-cooled heat-exchangers. \n\nThe biomass fuel is fed to the reactor by a screw-feeder located on top of the freeboard and \n\nfalls down through a vertical stainless steel tube and is discharged at bed surface. This \n\nvertical tube also permits to inject the secondary air together with the fuel. The freeboard \n\ntemperature is controlled by a water-cooled heat exchanger wound around the vertical fuel \n\nfeeding tube. In turns, the bed temperature is controlled by eight radial water-cooled probes \n\ninserted into the bed. The fuel feeding system is calibrated manually by means of a scale \n\nfor each type of biomass to be used as fuel. Also integrated in the bottom part of the reactor \n\nand located upstream of the primary air distributor plate (that is, in the wind-box) it is \n\nlocated an electrical element intended to be used for heating the primary combustion air \n\nduring the start-up procedure of the reactor.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n38 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 2. Pilot scale bubbling fluidized bed combustor (Department of Environment and Planning of \nUniversity of Aveiro, Portugal).  \n\nThe pneumatic circuits for controlling the various gas streams entering the fluidized bed \n\nreactor (e.g. combustion air, N2 purging gas, propane for the start-up gas burner) make use \n\nof solenoid valves to be able to operate the system either in an automatic or manual mode. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n39 \n \n\nThe gas sampling and analysis system comprises a series of water-cooled probes, suitable \n\npneumatic lines integrating gas conditioning units and a PTFE diaphragm pump, a set of \n\nonline gas analyzers (for example for O2, CO2, CO, NO), as well as pressure sensors and \n\nthermocouples (K-type). The water-cooled gas sampling probes are inserted into the \n\nabovementioned sampling ports located at several positions along the reactor height, each \n\none equipped with a K-type thermocouple, a plug filter at the tip located inside the \n\ncombustor chamber for removing particles, and a condenser located at the rear part of the \n\nprobe for removing water and heavy hydrocarbons. There is also a heated probe and \n\nsampling line (180\u00baC) inserted into the freeboard through the reactor top flange for hot gas \n\nsampling for total hydrocarbons quantification. The pneumatic circuits are integrated into \n\nautomatic gas control and distribution units which permit to selected a specific probe for \n\nsampling gases and turn the online gas analyzers into service in a controlled way. The \n\nexperimental system is controlled by a computer based data acquisition and control system. \n\nThe experimental data collected during each experiment run was recorded by the data \n\nacquisition system for subsequent analysis. \n\n \n\n2.3  Industrial scale test \n\nTwenty five tons of bottom ash from forest biomass combustion in an industrial \n\nbubbling fluidized bed combustor (BFBC) at a pulp and paper mill were treated by washing \n\nand sieving (&lt;1000\u00b5 m) at an industrial facility (dealing with treatment of raw material for \n\nthe construction sector, namely, prepares natural sand as aggregate for the construction \n\nindustry). The goal was to make the treatment of the bottom ash in order to be used as \n\nrecycled material in substitution to conventional raw material in industrial mortars \n\n(Chapters 6 and 7). With this industrial test, it was possible also to evaluate the efficiency \n\nthe washing and sieving treatment process, considering the process conditions. In Figure 2.2 \n\nit is shown the macroscopic aspect of the raw bottom ash, the layout of the industrial \n\ninstallation where the treatment of the bottom ash was done and respective process steps. \n\nThe bottom ash from forest biomass combustion in an industrial bubbling fluidized \n\nbed combustor (BFBC) was transported from the pulp and paper mill to the treatment \n\ninstallation and stored for 24 hours before test. The bottom ash treatment was performed in \n\na continuous way in the industrial plant, and included a continuous shower using an \n\nLiquid/Solid (L/S) ratio equal to 2, and has a processing capacity of 10 ton/h; the washing \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n40 \n \n\nsolution is treated by sedimentation in order to be reused in further washing cycles, in this \n\nway maximizing the use of water resources. \n\nThe physical, chemical and mineralogical characterization of the solid wastes \n\npreviously to the specific valorization as replacement material led to select some interesting \n\nalternatives for these wastes valorization.  However, many other specific characterization \n\nand its results are presented and evaluated in detail in the next seven chapters of this \n\ndocument. \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n41 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. 3.

Ferreira, Luis M. Machado, Marco Rodrigues, Isabel Coelho \n\nPublished in Waste Management 31 (2011) 370\u2013377 \nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2010.09.017 \n\nImpact Factor (5- year): 3.49; ISSN: 0956-053X \nWebQualis: A1 (Environmental Science); B1 (Materials) \n\nAbstract \n\nSustainable waste management system for effluents treatment sludge has been a pressing \n\nissue for pulp and paper sector. Recycling is always recommended in terms of \n\nenvironmental sustainability. Following an approach of waste valorisation, this work aims \n\nto demonstrate the technical viability of producing fiber-cement roof sheets incorporating \n\ncellulose primary sludge generated on paper and pulp mills.  \n\nFrom the results obtained with preliminary studies it was possible to verify the possibility \n\nof producing fiber-cement sheets by replacing 25% of the conventional used virgin long \n\nfiber by primary effluent treatment cellulose sludge. This amount of incorporation was \n\ntested on an industrial scale. Environmental parameters related to water and waste, as well \n\nas tests for checking the quality of the final product was performed. These control \n\nparameters involved total solids in suspension, dissolved salts, chlorides, sulphates, COD, \n\nmetals content. In the product, parameters like moisture, density and strength were \n\ncontrolled. The results showed that it is possible to replace the virgin long fibers pulp by \n\nprimary sludge without impacts in final product characteristics and on the environment. \n\nThis work ensures the elimination of significant waste amounts, which are nowadays sent \n\nto landfill, as well as reduces costs associated with the standard raw materials use in the \n\nfiber-cement industrial sector. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n45 \n \n\n3.1  Introduction \n\n Sustainability concept is becoming increasingly important for several industrial \n\nsectors, including the paper and pulp sector as well as the building sector, because they \n\npresent a strong impact as important economical activities [Lopes et al., 2003]. The waste \n\nmanagement is becoming a priority and the building sector is one of the most useful sectors \n\nfor diverse applications, in order to close with value the life cycle of certain products.  \n\n The use of industrial waste and by-product materials is widely recognized as one of \n\nthe major preferred options towards the achievement of sustainable development. The \n\nprevailing environment policies require the waste to be treated before going to landfill. \n\nTreating waste and valuing them as raw materials for construction or other ends is more \n\nsustainable, particularly, when wastes are already on site [Snelson et al., 2009]. \n\n A pulp and paper mill generates, in all stages of process production, large amounts \n\nof solid wastes differing greatly in composition and moisture content. In its fiber \n\nproduction line, the screening equipment discharges uncooked material from the digester \n\nand smaller screening rejects. The chemical recovery cycle produces mainly inorganic \n\nmaterial (called dregs and grits), energy production in the biomass boiler giving, as solid \n\nwaste, fly ash and purged sand in the case of bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) boilers and, \n\nfinally, also sludges coming from effluent treatment plant, classified as primary and \n\nbiological sludges according to their treatment procedure. \n\n Indeed, wastewater treatment plant is the biggest solid waste producer, generating \n\ntwo types of sludges, primary and biological. Primary sludge is mainly composed of fiber, \n\nlost in different equipments along the fiber line and settled in primary effluents treatment \n\narea. It also contains inorganic suspended solids, mainly calcium carbonate from the \n\ncaustic area. These solids are also decanted and become a primary sludge constituent. On \n\nintegrated pulp and paper mills this type of sludge has a much higher content of inorganic \n\nfractions, as a consequence of the precipitated calcium carbonate used as filler in paper \n\nproduction and in paper machine white water excess.  \n\n Biological sludge comes from the biological treatment unit and it contains \n\nmicroorganisms. This unit generally involves activated sludge reactors and sludges are \n\nobtained through secondary decanters, sludges thickeners and final belt press dewatering. \n\nWastes from pulp and paper industry are usually managed, in terms of waste disposal, \n\nusing several approaches including landfills, incineration, recycling in cement or ceramics \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n46 \n \n\nplants, lightweight aggregates, asphalt, agriculture, anaerobic treatment, and others [United \n\nNations Economic and Social Council, 2001; Hassini et al., 2005; Demir et al., 2005; Huet, \n\n1982; Shao et al., 2001; IZF, 1994; Podobnik and Zule, 2006; Krigstin and Sain, 2006; \n\nMonte et al., 2009; Lynde et al., 1997]. Wastewater sludges were already used in different \n\nsectors and the main applications are associated to agricultural purposes, biomass, \n\nincorporation in clay bricks, lightweight aggregates and in moulded gypsum cardboards \n\nproduction [Modolo et al., 2007; United Nations Economic and Social Council, 2001; \n\nDemir et al., 2005].  \n\n Considering the large amount generation of primary sludge production and its \n\nfibrous nature, this work attempts to develop a solution to add value to this material \n\nincorporating in a construction material where their fibrous nature could be advantageous. \n\nFor that, preliminary studies were developed at a laboratory level in a base composition \n\nused in fiber-cement sheets. The results showed that primary sludge could be incorporated \n\nin fiber-cement sheets in low contents, without damaging the final product characteristics \n\n[United Nations Economic and Social Council, 2001]. \n\n Fiber-cement is usually used as a building material in covering roofs, although it \n\ncan be used for other constructive purposes. Its composition incorporates up to 2.6% of \n\ncellulose fibers coming from kraft softwood pulp (virgin long fibers pulp - VLFP) in order \n\nto make advantageous use of its fiber content. These fibers are longer and coarser than \n\nmost fibers and have been found to provide many benefits in fiber-cement applications due \n\nto their high modulus and high fiber strength [Morton et al., 2006].  \n\n The focus of this work is to evaluate the use of primary sludge from kraft hardwood \n\npulping process in fiber-cement sheets production at an industrial scale. At this level, there \n\nis a need to control parameters such as the sludge incorporation level and its quality as a \n\nraw material, the water quality in the process and the final product characteristics. \n\n3.2  Experimental \n\n Virgin long fiber pulp (VLFP) represents 2.6% of total fiber-cement composition in \n\nproportion of dry raw materials. Conventionally the used fiber in fiber-cement process \n\nproduction is from softwood. In this experimental work, these softwood long fibers were \n\nreplaced by hardwood fibers from primary sludge generated in pulp and paper mill effluent \n\ntreatment at a fixed replacement level of 25%. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n47 \n \n\n3.2.1 Materials \n\nStandard Materials \n\n The fiber-cement sheet samples were prepared with standard fiber-cement raw \n\nmaterials: Portland cement (to provide strength): Commercial available ASTM Type I - \n\n42.5R, PVA\u2013fiber (the long term durability PVA fibers is used as reinforcement in cement-\n\nbase (Akers et al., 1989), and other commercial characteristics, such as, high modulus \n\npolyvinyl alcohol, elongation (~6.5%); Amorphous-silica: Dry silica fume (Elken \n\nMicrosilica Grade 940), with high SiO2 content (>90%), low moisture (<1,0%), loss on \n\nignition less than 3,0%, particle retention at 45 micron sieve below 1,5%, Bulk density \n\n(undensified: 200-350 kg/m3); Virgin long fiber pulp: kraft pulp softwood fibers, bleached, \n\nmoisture (? 10%), Ash content (&lt;1,0%);  Additives: (i) Flocculant (Magnafloc 1011): \n\nWhite granular powder, solid grade polymer, particle size (98% &lt;1400 \u00b5m), Bulk density \n\n(~0,65g/cm3); (ii) Antifoam (STRUKTOL J650): Polyalcohol based on polyoxyethylene-\n\npolyoxypropylene blockcopolymers.  \n\nPrimary sludge  \n\n The primary sludge is generated in the clarification of process water by kidney \n\ntreatments, e.g. dissolved air flotation [Monte et al., 2009]. The sludge consists of \n\nhardwood fibers (~70%, where a small content of this total may be associated with \n\ninsoluble lignin) and fillers (~5% of sand and 25% of precipitated calcium carbonate \n\n(PCC)). The PCC content in the sludge is generated in the integrated kraft pulp and paper \n\nprocess by the chemical reaction CaO+CO2?CaCO3, being limited by the calcium content \n\nmeasured as 10.37% (Table 3. 1) and its atomic mass (40 g/mol). The primary sludge \n\nspecific characterization is presented on Table 3. 1. Figure 3.1. shows fiber nature of this \n\nsludge and part of the inorganic content material present in them. \n\n3.2.2 Methods \n\n In order to replace VLFP with primary sludge in fiber-cement production at an \n\nindustrial scale, the following aspects were verified: \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n48 \n \n\n?

The beating process can be defined as a mechanical treatment of \n\npulp carried out in the presence of water and, in this case, by passing the pulp fibers \n\nsuspension through a disk refiner consisting of a rotating bladed element that moves in \n\nconjunction with a stationary bladed element. The term \u201cbeating\u201d is usually applied to the \n\nbatch treatment of pulp suspensions [Coutts, 2005].  \n\n \nFigure 3. 2. Primary sludge ready to be processed and to be incorporated to the disintegrator in big bags. \n\n Coutts and Kightly (1984) state that refining plays an important role in producing \n\nsurface area for fiber-to-fiber or fiber-to-matrix (in case of composites) bonding and, more \n\nimportant, can assist in controlling the drainage rates of processing liquids during the \n\nfabrication of products. Refining affects the hydraulic properties of the fiber effectively \n\nreducing its average diameter. This process also promotes an internal fibrillation or \n\ndelamination on fibers, external fibrillation of its surface and fines formation.  \n\nIn the pulp beating, the VLFP and sludge were mixed with water. The \n\ndisintegration process lasts around 30 minutes. In this point a suspension sample is \n\ncollected to measure the Shopper Riegler degree (\u00baSR). If an acceptable \u00baSR value \n\n(between 55 and 70 \u00baSR) is obtained, the suspension is sent to the pulper. Meanwhile, the \n\nsilica was already mixed with water before processing. The pulp is mixed with cement, \n\namorphous-silica and PVA in the mixer. The final suspension is carried to the fiber-cement \n\nsheet forming machine which includes a felt belt and four vats that filter the fiber-cement \n\nsheets water excess. The fiber-cement sheets are taken to the drying oven at 85\u00baC to \n\nremove the moisture.  \n\n The global fiber-cement sheets production involves the following steps: \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n50 \n \n\n1.

Fiber-cement process and water collecting places. \n\n 25% of the virgin long fibers pulp (VLFP) used in fiber-cement production were \n\nsubstituted by primary sludge in the industrial test. The fiber-cement sheets are produced in \n\nbatches. Each production batch involves, in this particular factory, a consumption of 195kg \n\nof virgin long fibers cellulose pulp. Hence, each batch received 48,75kg (dry base) of \n\nprimary sludge and 146,25kg of virgin long fibers pulp during industrial test days. Twelve \n\nfiber-cement series with primary sludge were produced in two days. The samples with \n\nsludge incorporation were collected for tests in this period and the reference samples were \n\ncollected a week before, on normal production days. The cellulose sludge chemical \n\nparameters were previously determined (Table 3.3) and involved moisture, pH, organic \n\n \n\n\"PULPER\" \n\nFIBRECEMENT MACHINE\n\nCEMENT AND AMORFOUS-SILICA\n\nFIBER-CEMENT SHEETS\n\nVATS\n\nMIXER\n\nBEATING\n\nVirgin long fiber pulp Primary sludge\n\nPVA\n\nDISINTEGRATOR\n\nVACUUM PUMP - COLLECTING POINT\n\nFIBER-CEMENT MACHINE\n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n51 \n \n\ncontents (550\u00baC), fiber content, conductivity, chlorides, sulphates, metals and density. \n\nWater samples from the process were also collected before and during the industrial test. \n\nThe samples named as CW represent the \u201cControl Water\u201d and the PSW samples represent \n\nthe \u201cPrimary Sludge Water\u201d.

This parameter allows evaluating the \n\npulp beating degree. This method is designed to provide a measure of the rate at which a \n\ndilute suspension of pulp may be dewatered. The determination of the drainability of a pulp \n\nsuspension in water is described in terms of a Shopper Riegler (\u00baSR) number. The \n\ndrainability is related to the surface conditions and swelling of the fibers, and constitutes a \n\nuseful index of the amount of mechanical treatment to which the pulp has been subjected \n\n[Morton et al., 2006]. In this fiber-cement production study case, the acceptable results are \n\nobtained within the range of 55 to 70 \u00baSR, following the standard proceedings. The highest \n\nthis value less drainable is the fibers cake. \n\n The industrial test took 12 hours in constant production.

It consists primarily of fibers, fines and \n\ninorganic material in mills that employ fillers in their products [Monte et al., 2009]. \n\n Figure 3.5 presents the fibers microscopic aspect. It is possible to verify the \n\ndifference between the Eucalyptus and Pinus fibers thickness, around 10 to 20 \u00b5 m and 40 \n\nto 60 \u00b5m, respectively. Eucalyptus globulus fiber achieves ~1 mm as maximum length. \n\nThe Pinus fibers are longer than Eucalyptus globulus fiber. This characteristic could \n\ncondition the sludge incorporation content and final product characteristics. \n\n The Schopper-Riegler and refinement time results are presented on Figure 3.6 and \n\nFigure 3.7, respectively. It was possible to decrease the refinement time in the process with \n\nthe primary sludge incorporation. The Eucalyptus fibers achieve the same \u00baSR degree using \n\nlower energy time comparing to Pinus fibers.

Total suspended solids in PSW are only slightly higher than the control value \n\nsample (Table 3.4). \n\n \nFigure 3. 6. Schopper-Riegler and refinement time results (S- with sludge; N- No sludge). \n\n The VLFP represents 2.6% of dry material in fiber-cement production. 25% of this \n\namount was substituted by primary sludge. Knowing that 40% of primary sludge \n\ncomposition is composed by inorganic material, the sludge suspended solids contribution \n\nin fiber-cement production is estimated in 26 kg per ton of dried fiber-cement produced. \n\nThis maximum solids content increasing might be retained on fiber-cement sheets or \n\ndrained to the process water together conventional solids. The increasing of sulphates and \n\nchlorides present in sludge composition parameters didn\u2019t have significant alterations in \n\nterms of process. \n\n3.3.2 Final product control \n\nIn terms of moisture content, every value for sheets produced with primary sludge \n\nachieved the specification limits. Fiber-cement sheets produced with primary sludge tend \n\nto present higher wet density values than the standard sheets. This happens because of \n\nshorter fibers presence in their composition. These fibers could more easily retain water \n\nand solids between the sheet mesh spaces (Table 3.5). Primary sludge includes in its \n\ncomposition almost 40% of inorganic solids, namely, sand. These inorganic charges \n\nincrease the fiber-cement sheet density in wet and dry state. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n55 \n \n\nTable 3. 5. Fiber-cement sheets control parameters results. \n\n \n\n The bending moment values of quality product control are between 55 and 71 \n\nNm/m and load at rupture minimum acceptable value is 4655 N. According to the obtained \n\nresults every fiber-cement sheet produced with primary sludge incorporation presented \n\nacceptable values for both parameters on the final product quality control (limits presented \n\nin Table 3.5).  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.  7.

They present \n\nsimilarities in aspect and the viewed surfaces present large amounts of fibers as expected. \n\nSmall particles of hydrated cement matrix were clearly distinguished from the fibers. The \n\nanalysis shows fiber-cement surfaces containing fibers arrangement. It was not possible to \n\ndistinguish Eucalyptus from Pinus fibers by SEM in the fiber-cement matrix. To get \n\nadditional information regarding the fibrous aspect of these materials, surface samples of \n\nthe produced fiber-cement, with and without sludge, were scratched, prepared and \n\nobserved by SEM (scanning electron microscope analysis). \n\n Standard Fiber-cement  \n(0-6h)\n\n? \n(Deviation)\n\nPrimary Sludge Fiber-\ncement  (6-12h)\n\ns \n(Deviation)\n\nmin max\n\nMoisture (%) 36 1.28 36 0.88 32 42\n\nWet density (kg/dm\n3\n) 1.801 0.02 1.813 0.01 NA* 1.850\n\nDry dens ity (kg/dm\n3\n) 1.476 0.03 1.485 0.03 1.400 NA*\n\nLoad at Rupture (N) 4693 2.12 5267 3.08 4655 NA*\n\nBending Moment (Nm/m) 56 15.12 63 16.8 55 NA*\n\n*NA= Non applied\n\nParameters\nQuality controlContinue production time/Average sheets value\n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n56 \n \n\n \nFigure 3.  8.

Scanning electron microscopy of control fiber-cement sheet. \n\n3.3.3 Evaluation of solution sustainability \n\n In 2008, the average fiber-cement production in this case-study factory was \n\nestimated at 20000 ton/year, consuming around 600 ton/year of VLFP. The costs \n\nassociated to this cellulose-based product amount were estimated in 350000 \u20ac/year (VLFP \n\n= 585 \u20ac/ton). By adopting this recycling solution, this fiber-cement company saves around \n\n87500 \u20ac/year on costs related to the virgin long fibers pulp purchase. The impact of the \n\npartial substitution of virgin pulp by primary sludge in the matrix of fiber-cement \n\nproduction was estimated based on the pulp costs, sludge transportation and energy costs \n\nrelated to refinement process. Table 3.6 presents the values used in this assessment and the \n\nestimated results. At the same time, this application allows to put in practice a sustainable \n\nwaste valorisation solution, avoiding disposal of 500 ton/year (150 ton/year in dry base) to \n\nwaste landfill, with an estimated cost around 11200 \u20ac/year (based on a landfill cost of \n\n22.40 \u20ac/ton). The costs for the paper and pulp mill, related to this particular waste disposal, \n\nmust be replaced by waste transport to the fiber-cement factory, which were estimated at \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n57 \n \n\n11200 \u20ac/year. This value was calculated using a base price of 0.08 \u20ac/ton/km for waste \n\ntransportation and admitting a total distance of 280 km in a two way travel between the \n\nparticular factories involved in this case study.  \n\nThis waste valorisation represents an environmental solution avoiding the waste \n\nlandfill. Even if the transportation costs were supported by the fiber-cement factory this \n\nwaste valorisation would present an economic benefit solution. \n\nTable 3. 6. Primary sludge valorisation in fiber-cement (Costs/benefits analysis). \n\n   \n\n3.4  Conclusions \n\n It was possible to verify the incorporation of cellulose sludge in this construction \n\nmaterial, without affecting its general product characteristics or its processing. \n\nReplacing 25% of the long cellulose fiber traditionally used by primary sludge from \n\neffluent treatment allowed the production of fiber-cement sheets, with properties within the \n\nrecommended specifications for the final product.  \n\n The obtained values in water control does not indicate significant alterations \n\ncomparing them in terms of COD, chlorides, sulphates, dissolved salts and metals during \n\nthe test period. \n\n The 40% of inorganic charges present in primary cellulose sludge promotes an \n\nincrease on the fiber-cement sheets wet density but, the results are within the acceptable \n\nlimit value. The bending moment and load at rupture for sheets with primary sludge were \n\nalso acceptable according to the final product quality control.  \n\n In summary, the substitution of conventional cellulose fiber for primary sludge \n\nfrom pulp and paper is a sustainable recycling and valorisation solution without significant \n\nFiber-cement production STANDARD with PRIMARY SLUDGE\nPulp (\u20ac/t) 585 NA\nPulp dry bas e (t/year) 600 450\nPrimary s ludge dry bas e (t/year) 0 150\nMoisture (%) NA 30\nPulp cost (\u20ac/year) 351,000.00 \u20ac 263,250.00 \u20ac\nEnergy (\u20ac/kWh)\nRefinement time (t/h) 2.6 1.7\n\n1,538.46 \u20ac 1,153.85 \u20ac\nNA 256.41 \u20ac\n\nDistance (km)\nTransport (\u20ac/year) NA 11,200.00 \u20ac\nTotal cos ts (\u20ac/year) 352,538.46 \u20ac 275,860.26 \u20ac\nBenefits (\u20ac/year)\nNA - no applied\n\n280\n\n76,678.21 \u20ac\n\nEnergy (\u20ac)\n\n0.085 \u20ac\n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n58 \n \n\nimpact on the fiber-cement production, the final product and in the environment. \n\nFurthermore, this waste valorisation not only presents an economic benefit around 87500 \n\n\u20ac/year to the fiber-cement factory but also avoids the waste landfill disposal for the paper \n\nand pulp company.

Ferreira, Luis M. Machado \nPublished in Waste Management 30 (2010) 685\u2013696  \nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2009.11.005 \n\nImpact Factor (5-years): 3.49; ISSN: 0956-053X \nWebQualis: A1 (Environmental Sciences); B1 (Materials) \n\nAbstract \n\nNowadays, the increasing amount of wastes is a concerning reality and the environmental \n\naspects has become a major priority. Following this worry, the purpose of this \n\nexperimental study was to investigate the possibility of using pulp and paper inorganic \n\nwastes, named dregs and grits, in bituminous mixtures as aggregate replacement to reduce \n\nenvironmental effects of these wastes disposal. First, the wastes were chemically and \n\nphysically characterized and also tested primarily taking into account the requirements for \n\naggregates in bituminous mixtures. Then, formulations were prepared replacing aggregates \n\nwith wastes in different amounts. The mechanical properties of these mixtures containing \n\nwastes were compared with reference samples based on standard methods. According to \n\nthe results it was possible to verify that grits had a good performance and it might be \n\ndirectly tested industrially as an aggregate in road construction.  On the other hand, dregs \n\nneed to be treated before incorporation to guarantee stable mixes in terms of water \n\nsensitivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nChapter 4 \n\n61 \n \n\n4.1  Introduction \n\n The re-use of wastes is important from different points of view: It helps to save and \n\nsustain the natural resources which are not replenished; it decreases the pollution of the \n\nenvironment and it also helps to save and recycle energy in production process [Hassani et \n\nal., 2005; Rocha, 2003]. The productive use of wastes material represents a way of solving \n\nsome problems of solid waste management [Davis and Cornwell, 1998]. Moreover, \n\nsuitable landfill sites are becoming more difficult to find as urban areas expand [Ngoc &amp; \n\nSchnitzer, 2009]. \n\n Wastes and industrial by-products could be valuable materials as alternative \n\nresources for building and construction and other applications [D. van Beers et al., 2009]. \n\nThe European Directive N\u00ba 2006/12/CE leads to several legal dispositions for the \n\nmanagement of wastes in which environmental objectives are set, namely, the need of \n\nrestricting and in a short time the volume of wastes deposit in landfill. \n\n Several studies were published on the use of waste material in pavements. These \n\ninclude the use of fly ash [Jackson et al., 2009], waste pumice [Saltan, 2008], glass, steel \n\nslag, tires and plastics [Huang et al., 2007], marble quarry waste [Akbulut &amp; G\u00fcrer, 2007], \n\ncement and mortars [Coutinho &amp; Garcia, 2008], polypropylene fibers [Serkan, 2008]. \n\nFollowing this perspective, this research describes a study developed with wastes from \n\npulp and paper industry in asphalt pavements application.  \n\n The pulp and paper industry generates large volume of wastes which is technology-\n\ndependent but the estimate is around 100 tons of waste for 550 tons of pulp production \n\n[Celpa, 2008]. In terms of Europe, eleven million tonnes of waste are produced yearly by \n\nthis sector [Monte et al, 2009]. It generates, in all stages of its production process, solid \n\nwastes with different composition and moisture content [Modolo et al., 2008]. \n\n The produced wastes are of organic and inorganic origin, some of them with reuse \n\npotential. Two of these wastes, named as dregs and grits, are still sent for landfill disposal. \n\nDregs are essentially sodium and calcium carbonates (Na2CO3 and CaCO3), sodium \n\nsulphide (Na2S) and a small organic fraction that was not totally burned in the recuperation \n\nbiomass boiler. Different salts are present in their composition coming from the pulp and \n\npaper mill process. They result from the smelt dissolution with the white liquor. Smelt is a \n\nflux material that is drained from the burning process in the recuperation boiler. This waste \n\n\n\n \nChapter 4 \n\n62 \n \n\n(dregs) is generated by the separation of CaCO3 and CaO in the green liquor clarifier. Grits \n\nare formed basically by CaCO3 and CaO which did not react in the slaker. Slaker is the \n\nplace where the reaction between Na2CO3 (present in green liquor) plus CaO (lime coming \n\nfrom lime oven) and H2O occurs, giving NaOH plus CaCO3, which constitutes the lime \n\nsludge that will be filtered and re-sent to lime oven for calcination. \n\n The purpose of this experimental study was to investigate the possibility of using \n\nthese pulp and paper wastes in asphalt concrete mixes as aggregate replacement in road \n\nregularization layers, through mix designs and specific characterization tests, contributing \n\nto reduce environmental effects of wastes disposal. \n\n4.2  Experimental \n\n The two bituminous pavement top layers involve aggregates and bitumen (Figure \n\n4.1). The experimental tests were done with mixes specimens developed according to \n\nDense Bituminous Layer specifications [Portuguese Road Authority \u2013 EP, 2008]. This \n\nlayer was chosen because it excludes external environmental agents\u2019 access and it has \n\nflexible specific conditions for specific aggregates.  \n\n \nFigure 4. 1. Flexible pavement example. \n\n Hence, the wastes were first chemically and physically characterized and also tested \n\nas specific aggregates for bituminous mixes. \n\n In all the work stages, Marshall specimens were prepared in laboratory scale \n\naccording to EN 12697.  This method is applied to every dense bituminous layer types with \n\nmaximum nominal aggregates dimension equal or lower than 25mm. The procedure \n\nimplies that aggregates and bitumen are heated at temperatures around 160\u00baC. The \n\nspecimens were compacted using a Marshall automatic hammer, with 75 compaction blows \n\non each side. The specimens were compacted and kept at room temperature (20\u00baC) for a \n\n \n\nFundat ion\n\nGranular Layer\n\nBit uminous Macadam Layer\n\nBit uminous Concret e\n\nDense Bit uminous - Regularizat ion Layer \n\n\n\n \nChapter 4 \n\n63 \n \n\nweek. The specimens\u2019 bulk specific and apparent gravity were measured. The mineral \n\naggregate voids (VMA) and air voids were determined. The specimens were kept in warm \n\nwater (60\u00baC) for 20 minutes before submitting to Marshall Stability test (maximum weight \n\nwhich promotes the specimens fracture) and the Marshall flow test (maximum deformation \n\nin which the specimen rupture occurs). Marshall stability and flow tests were used to verify \n\nthe pavements wastes potential applicability.  \n\n The standards used to obtain Marshall Test results for this study were: \n\n(a) EN 12697-30: 2000.

The OBC results were used to prepare the final mixes for the \n\n\u201cConserved Strength\u201d. The specimens\u2019 results were controlled and compared to the \n\nPortuguese code for dense bituminous mix asphalt values for typical heavy traffic type \n\nvalues. They are presented in Table 4.5. The final \u201cConserved Strength\u201d results were \n\nconsidered to examine the positive effects of wastes in the mixes. \n\n4.2.1 Materials \n\n Wastes: Grits (G), Conventional Dregs (DC) and Dregs without lime sludge (DWLS) \n\nwere collected in a pulp and paper mill. The DWLS was taken from a filter press, which allows \n\nhaving dregs without lime precoat that provided a more homogeneous waste. The DC was \n\ntaken from the vacuum rotary drum, which receives lime precoat during the waste filtration \n\nprocess. These wastes aspect is shown in Figure 4.2.

In this experiment, 20 specimens were \n\nproduced (four for each formulation) and the bitumen content was determined to be 5.4% \n\n(5.4% by weight of bituminous mix). In this phase, the bituminous mixes with 0%, 5% and \n\n10% of wastes content were investigated. \n\nTable 4. 4. Work phases distribution and Mixes identification. \n\n \n\nPhase II (Mixes design (OBC) and mixes water sensitivity): \n\n After the preliminary study validation in phase I, the dregs content was varied as 1, \n\n2, 3, 4 % and the grits content varied as 5 and 10%. The bitumen content was varied as 4.5, \n\n5.0, 5.5 and 6.0% (% by weight of bituminous mix) in the formulations. The test results \n\nprovide indication on the stability, flow, air voids content, voids in mineral aggregate \n\n(VMA) and voids filled with bitumen. These values are essential for the mixes\u2019 behaviour \n\nunderstanding. The optimum bitumen content (OBC) was determined according to the \n\nMarshall stability, voids content of compacted specimens, specific gravity and flow for \n\neach formulation. Using the OBC, more 42 specimens with the appropriated OBC were \n\nmade and the \u201cConserved strength\u201d was evaluated. Six specimens for each formulation \n\nwere prepared. They were separated in 2 sets of three specimens. One set was packed in \n\nwater at 40\u00baC and the other group in a controlled room at 20\u00baC during 72 hours. After this, \n\nMarshall stability and flow were checked. \n\nPhase III: Mixes design with washed wastes (DC and DWLS).  \n\n Identification code (IC) Details Developed work\nMBBr (Control) Conventional specific formulation\nMB5%DC 5% of conventional dregs\nMB10%DC 10% of conventional dregs\nMB5%G 5% of grits\nMB10%G 10% of grits\nMBBr (Control) Conventional specific formulation\nMBDC1% 1 % of conventional dregs and 2% of \"filler\"\nMBDC2% 2 % of conventional dregs and 1% of \"filler\"\nMBDC3% 3 % of conventional dregs and 1% of \"filler\"\nMBDC4% 4 % of conventional dregs and 0% of \"filler\"\nMBG5% 5 % of grits replacing crushed lime stone parcial content\nMBG10% 10% of grits replacing crushed lime stone parcial content\nMBDC2%washed 2 % of conventional washed  dregs and 1% of \"filler\"\nMBDC4%washed 4 % of conventional washed  dregs and 0% of \"filler\"\nMBDWLS2%washed 2 % of washed DWLS and 1% of \"filler\"\nMBDWLS4%washed 4 % of washed DWLS and 0% of \"filler\"\n\nPreliminary study -  Phase I\n\nOptimum Binder Content \n(OBC) - Phase II\n\nWashing Efficiency Tests - \nPhase III\n\n\n\n \nChapter 4 \n\n67 \n \n\n In this phase, mixes with washed wastes were tested in order to try to reduce or \n\neliminate water sensitive detected in phase II. The washing process involved the following \n\nprocedure: The wastes samples were weight (approximately 1200g) and dried (105\u00baC). \n\nThen the waste was set into 3 litres of heated distilled-water (around 70\u00baC) and stirred \n\nduring 10 minutes to guarantee the complete agglomerates dissolution. The water was \n\nheated to simulate the original dregs generation process. The solution was filtered after 10 \n\nmin. The conductivity and soluble salts content in the filtrate were analysed to control the \n\nwashing efficiency (250 ml for each sample). The process was repeated in every sample \n\nuntil it presents low constant values. In the solid waste sample, methylene-blue (MB) test \n\nwas used before and after washing, in order to check the waste washing efficiency. MB is a \n\nbasic colorant, represented by the formula C16H18N3ClS.2H2 and constituted by lamellate \n\nmolecules with unit effective area of 107 \u00c5 [Gomes, 1986]. There is a relationship between \n\nthe MB parameter and CEC (cation exchange capacity) and these values permit to evaluate \n\nthe material and indicate if it has a plastic behaviour [Gomes, 1986]. \n\n4.3  Results and Discussion \n\n4.3.1 Phase I \n\nGeneral characterization \n\n DC and DWLS present high moisture content (~50%) which represents energy \n\ncosts if the material needs drying. The sodium content for DC (6.1%) and DWLS (15.4%) \n\nis considered high because this element is soluble in water which might be a problem for \n\nthe final material application. Grits is practically constituted by calcium carbonate \n\n[(38%Ca/40gCa)*100gCaCO3) = 95%], which is interesting for building materials \n\napplication since calcium carbonate is used as raw materials in many of them. \n\n The Volatile Total Solids at 525\u00baC content in G and DC wastes is acceptable in \n\nbituminous aggregate criteria. For pavements application, DWLS formulations must be \n\ncarefully designed to try not to exceed the acceptable limits for organic inert contents \n\n(<1%).  \n\n The potentially toxic metals wastes obtained results are under the permitted limits \n\nby Environmental Legislation. They are classified as inert-wastes according to DL \n\n152/2002.  \n\n\n\n \nChapter 4 \n\n68 \n \n\nSoluble salts are not convenient for bituminous aggregates. The chlorides content might \n\nrepresent a problem for DC and DWLS. The soluble salts make the mixes \u201cConserved \n\nstrength\u201d values to decrease. Gradation results are presented in Table 4.3 and Figure 4.3. \n\nGrits (G) present similar grain size distribution compared to crushed stone usually used on \n\nbituminous mixes as fine aggregate. The DC curve presents the finest composition, \n\ncompared to the other wastes.  DC presents lime sludge (where 97% of lime particles size \n\nis below 75 \u00b5 m) in its composition and it represents around 40% of this waste (40% value \n\nreflects the way how the vacuum rotary drum is operated). Lime sludge presents fine \n\nparticle size and it may influence DC grain size results.  \n\n \nFigure 4. 3. Fine wastes particle size distribution (<0.063mm - SediGraph Method). \n\n Grits (G) sand equivalent value is similar to crushed stone for bituminous mixture. \n\nThis is not observed for Dregs (DC and DWLS) because of their high content in fine \n\nmaterial. DC and DWLS based samples results presented some plasticity behaviour (Table \n\n4.1). The plasticity behaviour might cause higher bitumen absorption and consequently \n\nmight turn the mixes susceptible to volumetric changes. This test showed that Grits is non-\n\nplastic. Aggregates for bituminous applications must present Methylene-Blue (MB) value \n\nbelow 0.8% [Picado Santos, 2002]. MB test results for grits (G) were acceptable (Table \n\n4.1). DC presented 0.19% and DWLS presented 2.14%. This higher value for DWLS is \n\nassociated to the lime sludge absence that has a high cation exchange (CEC).

Grits mixes (5 and 10% of \n\nincorporation) achieved the established values for all parameters. Besides, the stability \n\nresult for MB10%G is even better than the control mix. Marshall Stability was achieved for \n\nall mixes according to established values. \n\nTable 4. 5. Preliminary study (phase I). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4. 4. Bituminous mixes optical microscope images: (a) MBBr (50x), (b) MBG5% (10x) and (c) \n\nMBD5% (10x). \n\nMixes with dregs (MB10%DC) presented a not acceptable value in terms of voids \n\n(6.9%). When this parameter is higher than the specific value the mixes loose durability, \n\nworkability and fragile (they have lower deformation strength). High dregs content \n\npromote more bitumen absorption, which increases bituminous mixes costs. This fact \n\nlimited the dregs content in the next development phase. Figure 4.4 presents the mixes \n\nmicrostructure photos. It is clearly visible on Figure 4.4\u201cc\u201d that the dregs mix is dried and \n\nopaque compared to the other ones.  \n\n Mixes Identification units MBBr (Control) MB5%G MB5%DC MB10%G MB10%DC \nBitumem %\nBulk gravity g/cm3 2,437 2,436 2,437 2,434 2,431\nApparent gravity g/cm3 2,335 2,343 2,318 2,340 2,264\nVoids (n) % 4,2 3,8 4,9 3,8 6,9\nBitumen volumetric content (BVC) % 12,2 12,3 12,2 12,3 11,9\nVMA [void in mineral aggr.(n+BVC)] % 16,4 16,1 17,0 16,1 18,7\nBitumem saturation (n+BVC) % 74,5 76,3 71,4 76,1 63,3\nStability kN 12,0 10,6 11,2 13,8 9,4\nFlow  mm 3,9 2,9 2,5 2,8 2,5\nStability/Flow kN/mm 3,1 3,7 4,6 4,9 3,8\n\n5,4\n\n\n\n \nChapter 4 \n\n70 \n \n\n \nFigure 4. 5.

The values are included in the \n\nlimits for this type of mixes. Marshall Mix design results are presented from Figure 4.8 \n\n(control specimen) to Figure 4.14 (MBG10%). MBDC4% (Figure 4.12) presented a high-\n\nmaximum value (24.3 kN) for this parameter. The flow value indicates the flexibility and \n\nplasticity properties of the asphalt concretes under traffic load. All mixes indicated a \n\nconsistent relationship between the flow and bitumen content. As much the binder content \n\nis increased the flow also increases. The highest and the lowest flow value registered were \n\nfor MBDC1% (5.84mm) and MBDC3% (2.91mm), respectively. Mixes should present \n\nflow values up to 4 mm, which is the highest allowed value indicated. When 6% of \n\nbitumen was used, only MB5%G mix presented a lower value for this parameter.

This low value has a direct influence in the mixes apparent gravity \n\nand bitumen saturation. The mixes become more susceptible to permanent deformation. \n\nThese parameters are associated to the compaction mix level and permit to improve the \n\npavement general performance. MBDC4% presented the highest VMA value (16.8%). This \n\nresult might be associated with the dregs\u2019 content and the filler absence.

This is because the mixes filler content \n\nis between 2 and 3% as in the control sample (3% of filler). When filler is completely \n\nsubstituted by dregs, it makes the mix more porous and less workable. Void filled with \n\nasphalt (bitumen) results suggest that dregs absorb more bitumen than the other mixes. The \n\noptimum binder content (OBC) was determined by Marshall mixes design results. This \n\nvalue was used to achieve the mixes \u201cconserved strength\u201d in Table 4.6. Mixes MBBr, \n\nMBDC1%, MBG5% and MBG10% presented a good behaviour. 75% of conserved \n\nstrength was achieved for them. MBDC2%, MBDC3% and MBDC4% presented water \n\nsensitivity. This behaviour was already expected because Dregs present soluble salts in \n\ntheir composition. \n\n MDC1% and MDC4% voids content results are below the permitted value (3-6%). \n\nMBDC4% specimen dissolved in water, which made impossible to perform the test. \n\nRegarding the \u201cconserved strength\u201d behaviour of Grits-containing mixes, their \n\nperformance is acceptable compared to the control mix. Incorporation of 5% Grits gave \n\nslightly worse result than the mix with 10% of Grits, probably related with the particle size \n\ndistribution in the mixture and higher voids content in the 5% Grits mix.

This process demonstrated that is possible to \n\nobtain a better material after a simple treatment. The monitored parameters results during \n\nDC and DWLS washing can be seen in Figure 4.5. The measured parameters become lower \n\nand almost constant with the washing process for both wastes. The soluble salts decreasing \n\ncontent is an important factor for the possibility of re-using these materials in pavement \n\nsector. This kind of salts represents a problem in terms of \u201cconserved strength\u201d properties \n\naffecting the final product.  \n\n In terms of gradation, the final material presented fewer particles between 2 to \n\n0.425mm sieves compared to the wastes gradation before washing. These particles were \n\ndisaggregated and dissolved in smaller particles with dimensions between 0.18 and 0.075 \n\nmm (Table 4.7). Now, washed DC and washed DWLS gradation is \u201csimilar\u201d to hydraulic \n\nlime (compare the results checking Table 4.2. \n\n The MB parameter was also checked on the wastes. The washing results for MB \n\nparameter for DC and DWLS decreased the MB values considerably. The results are \n\nshown in Figure 4.6. The plasticity index after washing wasn\u2019t checked but it would be \n\ninteresting if it is lower.  \n\nTo achieve the \u201cconserved strength\u201d value for dregs mixes, DC and DWLS were \n\nwashed and tested in two incorporation contents (2 and 4%), using the same OBC found \n\nfor these formulations in phase II. Good results were obtained for all parameters in every \n\nmixes (Table 4.8). MBCD4% presented a very good performance (97%) compared to the \n\ncontrol mix, MBBr (90.7%), even with voids content lower than the allowed value. This \n\nproblem might be easily solved by a particle size adjustment of the aggregate. The problem \n\nwith water sensitivity was solved with the washing procedure. \n\n\n\n \nChapter 4 \n\n78 \n \n\nTable 4. 8. Gradation of wastes before and after washing process. \n\n \n\nTable 4. 9. \u201cConserved Strength\u201d Washed dregs mixes results (phase III). \n\n \n\n4.4 Conclusions \n\n In this work, the properties of pulp and paper mill wastes were compared with \n\nconventional aggregates used in asphalt pavements, in order to value them as raw materials \n\nfor this application. Hence, standard aggregates and pavements tests were carried out and \n\nthe main conclusions were: \n\n1. According to the results, it was possible to verify that grits could be directly tested \n\nas an aggregate for this pavements construction sector. Indeed, Grits mixes are \n\nacceptable and ready to be tested in industrial scale. This waste is compatible with \n\ncrushed stone already used as aggregate for road pavements.  \n\n2. Dregs presented soluble salts that didn\u2019t allow direct applications as-received from \n\nthe production process. After washing process, Dregs mixes had compatible values \n\ncompared to the reference mixes. They achieved Marshall Stability and flow values \n\nas expected. \n\n3. Washing process efficiency was demonstrated based in the results of conductivity, \n\nsoluble salts and methylene blue tests. These removed salts can be returned to the \n\npulp and paper mill representing, for this industry, also a valuable economic and \n\n \n\nDC before washing DC after washing DWLS before washing DWLS after washing\n25 100 100 100 100\n19 100 100 100 100\n\n12,50 100 100 100 100\n4,75 100 100 100 100\n2,00 99,6 100 99,5 100\n\n0,425 66,0 99,5 74,1 99,3\n0,180 54,6 94,0 56,4 97,1\n0,075 43,4 91,3 21,1 85,5\n\nSieve size \n(mm)\n\nAccumulated percentage passing \n\n \nParameters specimens in the water to 40\u00baC specimens condditioned 20\u00baC \n\nApparent Gravity (g/cm3) 2,422 2,420\nStability (kN) 15,96 17,59\nConserved strength (%)\nApparent Gravity (g/cm3) 2,438 2,425\nStability (kN) 17,59 19,68\nConserved strength (%)\nApparent Gravity (g/cm3) 2,43 2,43\nStability (kN) 12,23 12,58\nConserved strength (%)\nApparent Gravity (g/cm3) 2,41 2,40\nStability (kN) 19,22 21,31\nConserved strength (%)\nApparent Gravity (g/cm3) 2,38 2,39\nStability (kN) 17,78 20,03\nConserved strength (%) 88,7\n\n EN 12697:12/2003\nMixes (ID) Voids (%)\n\nMBBr\n\n4,0\n\nMBDC2%   \nwashed\n\nMBDC4%   \nwashed\n\nMBDWLS2% \nwashed\n\nMBDWLS4% \nwashed\n\n3,3\n\n2,9\n\n2,4\n\n4,0\n\n90,7\n\n89,3\n\n97,2\n\n90,2\n4,9\n\n5,3\n\nOBC\n\n4,8\n\n4,9\n\n5,3\n\n\n\n \nChapter 4 \n\n79 \n \n\nrecycling aspect resulting from this work.

In terms of waste management, it is possible to conclude that these wastes, \n\ngenerated in huge amounts during pulp paper production, can easily be drained by \n\nthis large tonnage activity (pavement construction sector), avoiding their landfill \n\nand contributing at the same time for natural resources preservation.  \n\n Pulp and paper mill permits to adapt a waste treatment stage quite easily.

Lime mud is a \n\nwaste generated in the production of cellulose by the kraft mill process. It is mainly \n\ncomposed of CaCO3, a small amount of magnesium carbonate and other trace minerals. \n\nMortars were prepared by adding different amounts of LM (10, 20 and 30% by weight of \n\ncement) in dry weight. The mortar compositions were evaluated through rheology and flow \n\ntable measurements, assuring that all the samples exhibited adequate conditions for testing \n\nin both equipments. The hardened state properties were also evaluated through mechanical \n\nstrengths at 7, 28 and 90 days of curing. Following a waste management solution \n\nperspective, this work intend to provide a general evaluation of LM application in cement \n\nbased mortars, looking at both fresh and hardened properties in order to guarantee that the \n\nfinal application requirements are not hindered.  \n\n \n\n. \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nChapter 5 \n\n83 \n \n\n5.1  Introduction \n\nThe negative influence of wastes on the construction materials properties require further \n\nresearch in order to optimize the characteristics of them. In recent years, the environmental \n\ndamage and the wastes generated from industrial activity, increased significantly \n\nworldwide and one of the most common solid waste disposal means is in controlled \n\nlandfills. Thus, the raw natural materials have become scarce and the adverse impacts on \n\nthe environment are visible [Binici et al., 2008; UMTC, 1995; OECD, 1997]. Best \n\navailable techniques for reducing waste is to minimize the generation of solid waste and/or \n\nuse these by products as alternative raw-materials, wherever practicable. Pulp and papers \n\nmills generates thousands tons of solid waste (organic and inorganic) every year that go for \n\nlandfill disposal (mainly inorganic types). The amount and the composition of these wastes \n\ndepend necessarily on the process techniques applied and the raw materials used to obtain \n\nthe pulp and/or the paper quality desired. In general, the solid waste composition from pulp \n\nand paper mills is known and constant, as a result of the current, highly controlled \n\nproduction process which permits the use and valorisation of the wastes in safe and \n\nenvironmental way [Monte et al., 2009]. Some applications of theses wastes have been \n\nfrequently researched including aggregates for bituminous mixtures [Modolo et al., 2010], \n\ncement [Ahmadi and Al-Khaja, 2001; Coutinho and Garcia, 2008], brick [Cernec et al., \n\n2005] and fiber-cement [Modolo et al., 2011]. From pulp mills, inorganic sludges are \n\nseparated from the chemical recovery cycle and normally landfilled after dewatering. Lime \n\nmud is an industrial pulp and paper kraft mill solid waste of the chemical recovery unit \n\n[Figure 5.1]. It has the code 03 03 09 in the European List of wastes (2004). It is mainly \n\ncomposed by calcium carbonate, small amount of magnesium carbonate and other trace \n\nminerals [Gaskin, 2004; Li et al., 2012]. Normally, the major part of this sludge is used as \n\nraw-material in the limestone make up process. Although this waste is partially used as \n\nraw-material in the own pulp and paper process, in this specific case, due to limitations of \n\nthe lime kiln, the limestone make-up does not drain all lime mud generated by the \n\nproduction process. Then, the lime mud surplus has been landfilled (approximately 500 \n\ntons/month in wet base). Essentially, the production of industrial pre-mixed mortars \n\nexceeds several million tons each year, consuming a huge amount of natural but pre-treated \n\nraw materials (e.g. siliceous sand) as aggregate as well as cement. This activity could be \n\n\n\n \nChapter 5 \n\n84 \n \n\nlooked as a target for the use of lime mud, as currently happens with the ashes generated \n\nfrom the coal and biomass combustion in concrete [Ampadu  et al., 2002; Cordeiro et al., \n\n2008]. Several studies related with the use of wastes as filler, aggregates or cement \n\nreplacement material in mortars or concrete have been researched. Some of them indicate \n\nthat may be the wastes could be classified as a pozzolanic material (i.e. cane bagasse ash), \n\nbut some points that their activity depends significantly on its particle size and fineness \n\n[Cordeiro et al., 2008; Rajamma et al., 2009; Taylor and Tait, 1999; Modolo et al., 2013; \n\nP\u00e9rez-Carri\u00f3n et al., 2014; Argiz et al., 2013]. Specifically, some uses for lime mud, such \n\nas in bricks, cement and pavements could be good alternatives to drain huge amounts of \n\nthis solid waste. Ero?lu (2006) tested lime mud also as soil stabilization of forest roads. \n\nThe results obtained showed that roads deformation could be stabilized and maintained by \n\nusing lime mud. In another work, lime mud was tested as additive in composite cement and \n\nthe results confirmed it as a potential waste for this application [Ero?lu et al., 2007]. The \n\nuse of limestone fillers in concrete and mortars has becoming more and more common in \n\nrecent years, pushed by economic and ecological drivers. Even the cement production is \n\nnow dominated by type II formulations, where the clinker is partially replaced by limestone \n\nfillers (up to 35 wt.%). In most cases limestone fillers simply acts as a component in the \n\ncement/mortar [Vuk et al., 2001; Benachour et al., 2008; Felekoglu, 2007]. However, \n\nEuropean Standards relating to aggregates for mortars (EN 13139: 2003) allows up to 22% \n\nin mass as an aggregate component.  \n\nFollowing the waste management perspective of finding an efficient alternative of lime \n\nmud valorisation, this work intend to show, through bench scale developed work, a \n\nsolution for this waste incorporation in cement-based materials providing not only a \n\ngeneral approach of lime mud characteristics, but also present results about the final \n\nproduct properties (mortars) in the fresh and hardened state. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \nChapter 5 \n\n85 \n \n\n \nFigure 5. 1. Kraft process flowsheet example; waste under study generated in the caustification line is written \n\nin gray color. \n\n5.2 Experimental procedure \n\nLime mud (LM) sample was used as collected, from a rotary filter chamber located \n\nin a pulp paper plant in Aveiro, Portugal. Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) type II -32.5 N, \n\nproduced with 65-79% of clinker, 21-35% of lime and 0-5% other components including \n\ncalcium sulphate as setting regulator, was used in the present study to prepare pastes and \n\nmortars. OPC has an average particle size of 14 \u00b5 m.  \n\nAvoiding energy costs in the future; the lime mud was tested without dewatering. The \n\nmoisture content (34%) was kept as collected and used in the mortars production. The \n\nwater final ratio was calculated adding up the waste water content plus additional fresh \n\nDigestor (170\u00baC)\n\nwasher\n\nwood ships\n\nrecovery boiler (~1000\u00baC)\n\nevaporator\n\ndissolution tank\n\ngreen liquor clarifier\n\nslakers\n\ncausticizing reactor\n\nwhite liquor clarifier\n\nlime mud washer\n\nlime oven (850\u00baC)\n\nblack liquor + cellulose\n\ncellulose\n\nconcentrated black licor\n\nsmelt\n\ngreen licor \n\nlime mud (CaCO3)\n\nash\n\ngrits\n\nmixing tank\n\nelectrostatic \nprecipitator\n\nNa2SO4\n\nash\n\nflue gas\n\nwasher dregs\n\nWhite liquor\n(NaOH + Na2S)\n\nWeak white liquor\n(NaOH + Na2S)\n\nwas tewater\n\nwater\n\nwater\n\nsteam\n\nwater\n\nwater\n\nlime\n(CaO)\n\n\n\n \nChapter 5 \n\n86 \n \n\nwater. Siliceous sand was sieved through a 1.18 mm before use in the mixture as aggregate. \n\nIts average size is 0.830 mm. The particle size distribution of LM was performed using a \n\nCoulter LS particle size analyzer (LS230FM). The real density of LM particles was \n\ndetermined with picnometer method (ISO/TS 17892-3/2004). The specific surface area was \n\nmeasured by nitrogen adsorption method according to Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET). \n\nThermal gravimetric and differential thermal analyses (TG/DTA) of the LM were \n\nperformed up to 1000\u00baC with a heating rate of 10 \u00baC/min, in a simultaneous TG/DTA (STA \n\n409 EP). The chemical composition of the LM and CEM II 32.5N were evaluated using X-\n\nray fluorescence spectroscopy using a Panalytical Axios spectrometer. The microstructure \n\nof the LM was studied using a scanning electron microscope (SEM - Hitachi SU-70). The \n\nchloride content was determined in the solid waste (LM) and in the mortars by the \n\nArgentometric method (CHLORIDE, 4500-Cl-; Standard Methods Committee, 1997). The \n\nsulfate content was determined in LM by Gravimetric method (SULFATE, 4500-SO4\n-2; \n\nignition of residue, Standard Methods Committee, 1997). Cement pastes (w/b = 50 wt.%.) \n\nand cement mortars (water/binder ~ 62 wt.%.) were prepared using different amounts of \n\nLM (10, 20 and 30% by weight of cement) in dry weight. The amount of water used in the \n\nmixtures was defined regarding the dosage of LM, in order to obtain an adequate \n\nworkability condition to test in the rheometer and flow table. The workability of mortars \n\nwas determined through rheology and flow table measurements, assuring that all samples \n\nexhibited an adequate condition in both equipments. In this way, it was possible to obtain a \n\nmore complete characterization in the fresh state. The complete cement-mortars \n\nformulations are shown in Table 5.1.  \n\nThe procedures used to prepare the formulations included: (i) placing lime mud into \n\nthe water; (ii) mixing for 1 min at a low rotation speed of 60 rpm; (iii) stopping for 1 min; \n\n(iv) mixing again for 1 min at a higher rotation speed (120 rpm). A rheometer (Viskomat \n\nPC model, Schleibinger) was used to measure the rheological behaviour of fresh mortars, \n\nusing a maximum speed rotation (100 rpm) and 60 min of total test time. The rheological \n\nparameters (yield stress and plastic viscosity), was defined by using the Bingham model \n\n[Paiva et al., 2009; Ferraris et al., 2000; Banfil, 2003; Senff et al., 2012]. The workability \n\nof mortars was also measured through the spread diameter on flow table, according to EN \n\n1015-3:1999. The setting time of samples was determined by the Vicat needle penetration \n\nmethod following EN 196-3:2005, while the kinetic of hydration was determinate in a \n\n\n\n \nChapter 5 \n\n87 \n \n\nquasi-adiabatic calorimeter. For the mechanical test (flexural and compressive tests, EN \n\n1015-11:1999), mortars specimens with 40 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 160 mm were produced and tested after \n\n7, 28 and 90 days cured in standard conditions (temperature = 22\u00baC and relative humidity = \n\n65%) (EN 1015-2:1998). Apparent density and water absorption were also determined by \n\nthe immersion technique according to EN 1015-10:1999. Capillary was measured in \n\nmortars specimens according to EN 1015-18:2002. The crystalline phases of LM and \n\nmortars were detected by X-ray diffraction \u2013 XRD (equipment RIGAKU-Geiger flex \n\ndiffractometer). \n\nTable 5. 1.

LM real density was slightly lighter than OPC. LM \n\npresented a surface area of 5.17m2/g and its microstructure is shown in figure 5.3. The \n\nchemical analysis of LM is shown in table 5.2. LM contained a chloride content of 0.08 \n\nwt% and sulphate content 0.05 wt%. The presence of chlorides in cementitious materials \n\ncan accelerate the setting time and together sulphates can also reduce durability by \n\ndeterioration of microstructure [Rajamma et al., 2009]. LM is basically constituted by \n\ncalcium carbonate (CaCO3).

TGA/DTA curves of Lime mud. \n\n5.3.2 Cement lime mud formulations \n\n5.3.2.1 Fresh state properties \n\nIn general, LM-containing samples modified the rheological behaviour in different \n\nlevels as indicate in the Fig. 5.5. Mortars containing 30% LM showed highest torque and \n\nyield stress values along the time. The presence of fine particles in the mixtures requires an \n\nextra dosage of water or superplasticizer additive to keep the workability invariable. \n\nHowever, the mentioned factors influence significantly the rheological behaviour [Senff et \n\nal., 2012; Vaysburd and Emmons, 2004] and the eventual impact due to fine particle is \n\nhard to be quantified. Is important remind here that the purpose of this experimental \n\nresearch is evaluate the real influence of LM, keeping them invariable. The reduction of \n\nplasticity can be related to the cohesiveness and intense particle attrition. Moreover, the \n\npresence of agglomeration or tridimensional structures formation can also affect \n\nparticularly the torque and yield stress evolution along the test. In fact, the yield stress was \n\nthe main rheological parameter affected regarding then plastic viscosity that remained \n\nalmost constant at the end of the test.  \n\nAs much as lime mud has been added the mortars spread (flow table) has decreased \n\n(Figure 5.6). The workability of mortars with 30% LM decreased ~ 15% regarding the \n\ncontrol sample. This fact can be due to the particle cohesion increasing and the remaining \n\nwater content, as mentioned before.  \n\n\n\n \nChapter 5 \n\n90 \n \n\nThe same behaviour was observed by Felekoglu et al (2007). The authors testing two types \n\nof materials (quarry waste limestone power \u2013 QLP, and powder produced by direct \n\ngrinding of Limestone \u2013 PLP) showed that PLP compositions flowability do not differ \n\nsignificantly when compared with reference sample. On the other hand, an accentuate \n\nflowability decreasing was observed on QLP compositions. They concluded that this fact \n\nwas associated to the powders particles fineness and shape.  Finer powder (PLP) improved \n\nthe spread flow values compared to coarser powder (QLP). The authors recalled that at first \n\nsight, due to the increased surface area, it seems not logical to expect higher flow values \n\nfrom a mixture incorporating finer powders when other variables are kept constant (in \n\nparticular water content). However, just beside particle size, particle surface characteristics \n\nand surface porosity can play significant roles in designating the fresh state behaviour of \n\ncement pastes. \n\nThe setting time revealed distinct behavior when LM was added in the mixtures \n\n(Figure 6). The control sample exhibited the highest period, while 30LM-containing \n\nmortars reduced ~25%. This fact could be related to water remaining in the cement matrix \n\nbecause of the fineness effect of the added particles in the LM composition. In addition, the \n\npH of hydration solution can also influence the hydration mechanism in cements [Rajamma \n\net al., 2012]. Some other factors can also contribute to the setting anticipation, i.e. the \n\npresence of Cl- ions on LM. Chlorides exert some influence on the kinetics of hydration, \n\nbecoming higher in cement with extra dosage of LM. However, according to the EN 998-\n\n1:2003 standard, the global content of Cl- ions should not exceed 0.1wt.% of \n\nmortar/concrete constitution, since the efflorescence formation is often observed, \n\ncompromising the durability of the material [Vaysburd and Emmons, 2004; Kaushik and \n\nIslam, 1995;  Sanjuan, 1995]. Besides, the reaction between Cl- ions and C3A (tricalcium \n\naluminate) or C4AF (tetracalcium aluminoferrite) imply in the chloroaluminates formation \n\n[Sanjuan, 1995], in which the expansion occurrence increase the porosity that diminishes \n\nthe mechanical strength. \n\n The kinetics of hydration results measured by calorimetric are illustrated in the \n\nFigure 7. The maximum values of exothermic peak were registered after a period of 12h. In \n\ngeneral, two main peaks can be observed, when the Portland cement is mixed with the \n\nwater [Older, 1998], as follows: (i) the first peak occurs few minutes after contact with \n\nwater, where several Ca2+, ?24SO , Na\n+, K+, and OH- ions are release to the aqueous solution \n\n\n\n \nChapter 5 \n\n91 \n \n\nfrom gypsum, C3S, C3A and C4AF phases; (ii) the second peaks occur is caused by faster \n\ncrystallization of CH and C-S-H. In both of cases, the presence of LM did not influence \n\nsignificant the results regarding the control sample. In fact, developed studies demonstrated \n\nthat cements with small additions of limestone filler could be expected to have better \n\nperformance if they have higher C3S content and at the beginning of hydration, limestone \n\ndo not significantly change the heat of hydration. Vuk et al (2001) also verified that the \n\naddition of limestone exhibited a strong effect on the initial setting measured by Vicat \n\nneedle. The authors suggested that setting time is related to the type of used clinker and \n\nfineness cement (higher the limestone addition higher was the fineness of cement).  \n\n5.3.2.2 Hardened state properties \n\nThe mechanical and physical properties of the freshly prepared and hardened \n\nmortars containing LM are listed in Table 3. Some authors consider the effect of limestone \n\non cement to be only physical, taking into account the increase in strength [Soroca  and \n\nStem, 1976].  \n\nIn this case, the mechanical strength of mortars (7, 28 and 90 days) did not show any \n\nsignificant differences between the studied compositions and the control mortar (Table \n\n5.3). The compressive strength of LM containing samples increased around 8% compared \n\nto the control sample at 28 days of curing. This difference between samples decreased at 90 \n\ndays, but not significantly.  \n\nAccording to the results obtained for all mechanical strengths, LM does not \n\ninfluence in a negative way the mortars properties which suggest that this waste could be \n\nused as alternative material for conventional fine aggregates replacement. Specifically in \n\nterms of bulk, the filler effect is obvious, whereby mortar densifies up to an optimum value \n\nsituated between 10 and 20% of LM amount. Nevertheless, it is observed that mixes with \n\n30% of LM presented a slightly decreasing on this parameter at 28 days of curing. This fact \n\nwas also observed by B\u00e9n\u00e9rina et al. (2005). They proved that a density increase of dry mix \n\nup to an optical value of filler amount which represents 9 to 16% sand mass replacement \n\n(depending on the sand), and a regular decrease for higher proportions. They interpreted \n\nthis as filler powder first filling voids around sand grains, up to the optimum and concluded \n\nthat higher filler amounts, those voids being completely filled; filler powder occupies the \n\nplace of sand grains, hence diminishing sand proportion, and consequently the mix density. \n\n\n\n \nChapter 5 \n\n92 \n \n\n  \n\nFigure 5. 5.

As much as the LM content increases in the \n\ncement mortars, lower becomes the capillarity coefficient. Many factors could influence \n\nthis parameter and also it might be associated with the mortars structural arrangement. As \n\nthe LM particles sizes are finer than the used sand, they could fill out same spaces inside \n\nthe cement matrix causing this capillarity decreasing effect. The improvement is ascribed \n\nto reduced porosity [Ben\u00e9rina et al., 2005]. Regarding the filler effect phenomena, \n\nMoosberg-Bustnes et al (2004) observed that up to certain amount, the insertion of fine \n\nfiller particles allows denser packing of cement paste and Benachour et al (2008) \n\ndemonstrated that higher filler content increases the total porosity, but the macro-porous \n\npopulation diminishes in relation to the micro-porous. \n\n5.4 Conclusions \n\n This paper showed that samples prepared with higher dosages of CaCO3 present in \n\nthe LM makes this waste an interesting material to be used as a fine mineral aggregate in \n\ncement-based-mortars.    \n\nIf flow table and rheometer are used to define mortars formulations the maximum amount \n\nto be added is restricted. In fact, the rheometer limited the LM content to 30% maximum. \n\nThe yield stress increased with the content of LM and along the test time. The plastic \n\n\n\n \nChapter 5 \n\n95 \n \n\nviscosity did not showed noticeable change after the first 10 min of test, being the yield \n\nstress the rheological parameter that suffers the highest influence of LC incorporation. The \n\nspread on table of mortars containing 30% LM decreased about 15% regarding the REF. \n\nThe mechanical strength was not significantly influenced by LM addition. \n\nRegarding the economic aspects, there would be an opportunity to avoid the landfill of \n\nthousand tonnes of LM per year due to the expressive waste volume generated and, at the \n\nsame time, savings in a natural raw material such as limestone could be achieved. \n\nNevertheless, the moisture content of the LM has to be eliminated in case of using this \n\nwaste as filler in dry-mixed industrial mortar preparation. \n\nAcknowledgements \n\n The authors would like to thank RAIZ and Portucel Soporcel group for their \n\nvaluable help and contribution in this work.

In this work, bottom bed ashes from combustion of \n\nforest biomass residues in BFBC were used as aggregates in rendering mortar \n\nformulations. The ashes were characterized considering their particle size distribution and \n\nchemical/phases composition. When compared to conventional calibrated sands used as \n\naggregates, the ashes are composed by particles covering a wider size distribution. SiO2 is \n\nthe major oxide but CaO content is over 10 wt%, suggesting some cementitious activity \n\nthat was not confirmed. The amount of chlorides is significant and then water leaching and \n\nscreening pre-treatment improved the quality of the ashes, despite requiring devoted \n\ninstallation and investment. Mortars produced by replacing commercial sand with \n\nequivalent mass of 50 and 100 wt% of ash show similar characteristics to the reference \n\n(ash-free) formulation, and satisfied all tested standard specifications. Main worries are \n\ncaused by the variation of water level of the ashes along the time and the need to control \n\nthe concentration of chlorides. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n99 \n \n\n6.1  Introduction \n\n Fluidized bed combustion (FBC) is recognized as the most appropriate technology \n\nfor biomass combustion, due to the inherent advantages of low processing temperatures, \n\nisothermal operating conditions and fuel flexibility. The existing FBC technology at \n\nindustrial scale includes bubbling fluidized bed combustors (BFBC) and circulating \n\nfluidized bed combustors (CFBC). Among other characteristics, these technologies differ \n\nin the pattern of gas-solid hydrodynamics in the reactor, the size of the bed particles, the \n\nheat and mass transfer rates in the reactor, and the temperature and flue gas composition \n\nprofile along the reactor. This in turns influences the characteristics of the ashes produced \n\nduring biomass combustion, and thus, flows of ashes with distinct properties will be \n\nproduced in these installations [Van Loo S &amp; Koppejan, 2008; Yin et al., 2008].  \n\nDuring biomass combustion in BFBC, two main types of ashes are produced: \n\nbottom bed ashes and fly ashes. The bottom bed ashes are composed by the sand particles \n\n(mainly quartz) purged from the original bed, inorganic (soil and small stones) components \n\nof the fed and the unburnt biomass fraction. In opposition to a grate furnace, where the \n\nbottom ashes represent the higher percentage of the total ashes produced, in the BFBC the \n\nbottom bed ashes often represent the lower fraction; the bottom bed ash fraction can \n\nrepresent 5%wt [Latva-Somppi et al., 1998], 10%wt [Dahl et al., 2009], 17%wt [Dahl et \n\nal., 2010], or be as high as 50%wt to 60%wt as often observed in some Portuguese thermal \n\nplants BFBC [Tarelho et al., 2012]. The bottom ashes are generated upon periodic bed \n\ndischarges that are required to assure the renovation and to avoid agglomeration and \n\ndefluidization, as well to maintain the bed height and the suitable particle size distribution. \n\nThose parameters are crucial to guarantee proper hydrodynamic conditions of the bubbling \n\nbed [Van Loo &amp; Koppejan, 2008; Latva Somppi et al., 1998]. \n\n The bottom bed ashes from BFBC have the code 100124 [European List of wastes, \n\n2004] and are normally non-hazardous wastes. They are mostly composed by silica sand \n\n(quartz) particles, ranging in size from few micrometers until some millimeters, often \n\ncontaining a relatively thin (with a few micrometers) coating layer that is mainly composed \n\nof inorganic glassy material [Vassilev et al., 2010]. \n\n Since the emissions from burning of biomass are considered CO2 free, several new \n\nplants were installed in the past few years [Van Loo &amp; Koppejan, 2008; Tarelho et al., \n\n2011]. As a consequence, the amount of ashes generated increased considerably. \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n100 \n \n\nControlled landfilling is their common destination but recycling alternatives should be \n\npursued. According to Maschio et al (2011), the use of bottom ash in cement, mortars or \n\nconcrete is feasible and can have a beneficial impact on environment. However, products \n\nmust be durable and show suitable mechanical properties, while the release of potential \n\nhazardous elements should stay below the legal limits. \n\n For example, the actual production of industrial pre-mixed mortars exceeds several \n\nmillion tons each year, consuming a huge amount of natural but pre-treated raw materials \n\n(e.g. quarried sand) as aggregates as well as cement or other binders. This activity can be \n\nlooked as a target for the incorporation of bottom ashes, as currently happens with the fly \n\nashes generated from the coal combustion in concrete [Ampadu &amp; Torii, 2002]. Maschio et \n\nal (2011) tested fly and bottom ashes from biomass combustion as cement replacement in \n\nmortar formulations. Other authors tested coal ash and biomass fly and bottom ashes as \n\nsubstitute of natural aggregates in concrete and mortars [Pandey and Sharma, 2000; \n\nRavina, 1997; Cheah &amp; Ramli, 2012; Esteves et al., 2012; Kim &amp; Lee, 2011; Kim et al., \n\n2012]. Fresh and hardened properties were evaluated, including the rheological behaviour \n\nand water demand, mechanical strength, air permeability, and resistance to carbonation. \n\nUnder limited and controlled conditions, the solutions are promising. \n\n In the actual study, the conventional aggregate (sand, herein named S) used in \n\nindustrial rendering-mortars was substituted by the bottom ash produced from the burning \n\nof biomass in BFBC. The need of pre-treatment operations before incorporation, namely \n\nwashing and screening/sieving, was also evaluated. The leaching of chlorides is crucial to \n\navoid deleterious effects on the durability and also to control the setting behaviour \n\n[Scherer, 2006; EN 998-2:2003]. At the same time, the adjustment of particle size \n\ndistribution of the aggregates is also relevant to control the workability [Senff et al., 2009] \n\nof the mix and the compactness of the bodies, which determines their mechanical strength \n\n[Senff et al., 2011]. \n\n6.2  Methodology \n\n6.2.1 Thermal power plant characteristics \n\n The bottom bed ashes here studied were collected from a 50 MWth BFBC, located \n\nin the centre of Portugal. It burns forest biomass residues, namely eucalyptus bark and \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n101 \n \n\nremains from logging activities. The temperature of the bubbling bed ranges from 800\u00baC to \n\n900\u00baC, while the O2 concentration in the flue gas varies between 4%v/v and 7%v/v (dry \n\nbasis). The ash was directly collected in the ashtray of the combustor, schematically \n\nrepresented in Figure 6. 1. \n\n \nFigure 6. 1. Schematic view of the ash flows generated in the BFBC, including the basic operations \n\nimplemented for potential further valorization. \n\n6.2.2 Raw material characterization \n\n The bottom bed ash was used in two different conditions, as shown in Figure 6. 2: \n\n(i) just sieved (between 250 to 1000\u00b5 m) in a lab-scale equipment to adjust the particle size \n\ndistribution to the one of the commercial aggregate (sand) normally used in mortar \n\nformulations; the ash was here identified as BA (Bottom Ash); \n\n(ii) pre-treated (washed and sieved), intending to diminish the content of soluble salts \n\n(namely chlorides) \u2013 identified as TBA (Treated Bottom Ash). The treatment was \n\nperformed in a continuous way in an industrial plant that prepares natural sand as aggregate \n\nfor the construction industry. The process includes a continuous shower that fixes the L/S \n\n(liquid to solid) ratio = 2, and has running capacity = 10 ton/h; the washing solution is then \n\ntreated by sedimentation to be reused in further washing steps. \n\n \n\nSecondary air \n\nBiomass \nFresh sand\n\nCoarse (dp > 1.0 mm) bottom bed\n(to treatment, material valorization, or disposal)\n\nFine (dp &lt;0.3 mm) bottom bed ash\n(to treatment, material valorization, or disposal)\n\nBottom bed ash sieving \n\nFly ash \n\nFly ash\n(to treatment, material valorization or disposal)\n\nPrimary air\n\nBottom bed ash\n\nBottom bed with intermediate particle\nsize (0.3 mm &lt;dp &lt;1.0 mm)\n\nMaterial valorization in\nconstruction materials \n\nAdditional treatment\n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n102 \n \n\n \nFigure 6. 2. Methodology of processing bottom ashes for rendering-mortars production \n\n The chemical composition of ashes and other of the other constituents was \n\ndetermined by X-Ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy \u2013XRF (Panalytical Axios spectrometer), \n\nwhile the crystalline phases were detected by X-ray diffraction \u2013 XRD (equipment \n\nRIGAKU-Geiger flex diffractometer). BA and TBA particles were also observed by \n\nScanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS HR-\n\nFESEM Hitachi SU-70). The loss of ignition of the ashes was estimated upon firing at \n\n1000\u00b0C. The particle size distribution of the coarse aggregate fraction (S2) and of the ashes \n\nwas obtained by sieving [EN 933-1: 2000]. \n\n6.2.3 Mortar formulation and characterization \n\n Prepared formulations are presented in Table 6. 1. Aggregate\u2019s fines are composed \n\nby limestone filler (LSF) and S1 sand. The preparation of mortars included: (i) water \n\nweighing and addition to the solids; (ii) mixing for 30 seconds at a low rotation speed (60 \n\nrpm); (iii) stopping for 1 min; (iv) mixing again for 1 min at the same low speed and, (v) \n\nkeep the mixture in stand by for 10 minutes before testing the fresh state properties. \n\nProperties evaluated in the fresh condition are listed in Table 6. 2. Then samples were \n\ncured at 20\u00baC and 65%RH, in a climate room. Finally, the hardened mortars were \n\ncharacterised by following, when existing, standard procedures (see Table 6. 2). \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n103 \n \n\nTable 6. 1. Mix proportions tested. \n\n \n\nTable 6. 2. Standards used in the characterisation of the mortars. \n\n \n\n To estimate the concentration of chlorides leached from cured specimens, samples \n\nwere broken in small pieces and then milled and sieved (&lt;125\u00b5 m). After drying at 105\u00baC, \n\nthe powders (10g) were immersed in distilled water (100mL) and the leaching process was \n\nconducted according to EN 1015-17:2000. After 24h, the solution was filtered and the \n\nconcentration of chlorides was measured by potenciometry, by using a chloride selective \n\nion electrode. \n\n Two prismatic specimens (25x25x285mm) from each formulation were used to \n\nmeasure the dynamic elastic modulus (E), by determining the longitudinal resonant \n\nfrequency and accounting for the density and length of the sample. The measurement was \n\nconducted with an Oscilloscope \u2013 HAMEG HM303-4 (30Hz) coupled to a power amplifier \n\n(LDS  PA25E) and a current source 4102C (DYTRAN Instruments). The product \n\nvalidation was done by comparing the characteristics of the samples with current product \n\nspecifications, listed in Table 6. 3. \n\nPortland Cement \n(Type I, 42.5R)\n\nBA              TBA     S1 S2  LSF   Water\n\nREF* 0 0 20\n\nBA50 10 0 10\n\nBA100 20 0 0\n\nTBA50 0 10 10\n\nTBA100 0 20 0\n\n (w.t%)\n\n14 45 20 16.5\n\nSamples \nIdentification\n\nProduct State Test Test period Unit Standard\n\nApparent density g/cm\n3 EN 1015-6:1998\n\nSetting time h EN 196-3: 2005\n\nWater retentivity % EN 1015-8:1998\n\nFlow Table mm EN 1015-3:2007\n\nAir content % EN 1015-7:2007\n\nEN 1015-17:2000 (eluate)\n\nPotenciometry (determination)\n\nUnrestrained shrinkage After 7 and 28 days mm/m Cachiers du CSTB (2669-4): A3.3\n\nCompressive Strength After  7 and 28 days of curing MPa EN 1015-11:1999\n\nElasticit Modulus 28 days MPa Cachiers du CSTB (2669-4): A3.2\n\n%\n\nFresh Immediately after mixing\n\nWater-soluble chloride After 90 days of curing\n\nHardened\n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n104 \n \n\nTable 6. 3.

The decrease observed on \n\npre-treated ash is a result of the removal of soluble components (salts) and of some organic \n\nmatter initially present in the material. \n\n \nFigure 6. 3. Low magnification SEM views of particles (left) and corresponding EDS mapping for Ca (right \n\nside in red) on the surface layer: a - conventional sand; b - BA; c \u2013 TBA \n\nAccording to the EN 998-1:2003 standard, the global content of Cl- ions should not \n\nexceed 0.1wt.% of mortar/concrete constitution. The decrease of Cl- concentration (about \n\n60%) in TBA ashes (Table 4), when compared to BA, reflects the washing efficiency of the \n\napplied industrial treatment. The presence of chlorides tends to anticipate the setting \n\nprocess [Nilforoushan &amp; Sharp, 1995; Kaushik &amp; Islam, 1995; Makaratat et al., 2011], but \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n106 \n \n\ncause then strong deleterious effects on hardened bodies. Formation of efflorescence is \n\noften observed, compromising the durability of the material [Vaysburd &amp;Emmons, 2004; \n\nKaushik &amp; Islam, 1995]. Additionally, Cl- ions tend to react with C3A (tricalcium \n\naluminate) and C4AF (tetracalcium aluminoferrite) phases forming chloroaluminates \n\n(Sanjuan, 1997) with associated expansion and porosity enhancement that diminishes the \n\nmechanical strength.  Anyway, TBA shows chloride concentration below that of cement \n\n(Table 6. 4), and then those problems are not predicted in the prepared mortars. \n\nThe particle size distribution of the components is one of the basic criteria considered by \n\nmortar producers, in order to adjust the mixing process and to improve the compactness of \n\nthe samples. The fine sand (S1) is mostly constituted by particles having dimensions \n\nbetween 63 and 300 \u00b5 m, while the average size of coarse aggregate particles (S2) is 0.5 \n\nmm. Its size distribution is somewhat broad; including particles smaller than 0.125 mm and \n\na significant portion above 1 mm. BA particles are all comprised between 0.25 and 1mm, \n\nbut TBA ones presents around 10 wt% of its particles above 1.0 mm. It is because the \n\nlaboratorial sieving process is more controlled than the industrial process. \n\nFigure 6. 3 shows of cross section SEM low magnification views of bottom ash \n\nparticles. For comparison, conventional S2 sand particles were also analysed. Images \n\nconfirm the dimensional and shape similitude between S2 conventional sand particles and \n\nthe ashes. EDS analysis reveals the presence of a Ca-rich coating layer (in red) in BA and \n\nTBA particles, denoting the occurrence of surface reactions between inorganic biomass-\n\nbearing components and the sand. The detected calcium silicate and calcite phases are \n\nprobably concentrated in the skin. \n\n6.3.2 Characterization of mortars \n\nFresh state properties \n\n Figure 6. 4 shows the setting time of the prepared mortars. BA and TBA containing \n\nformulations tend to show the beginning of setting slightly anticipated in comparison to the \n\nreference (REF) mix. The open time (period between the beginning and final setting) is \n\nalso shorter, particularly on mortars where S2 was fully replaced by ashes (BA100 and \n\nTBA100). Apart some minor influence of the compactness of the mixes, the presence of \n\nchlorides might be the main responsible for the changes [Demirbas, 2004; Makaratat et al., \n\n2011; Nilforoushan &amp; Sharp, 1995]. \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n107 \n \n\n \nFigure 6. 4. Beginning and final setting time of the mortars. \n\nTable 6. 5. Entrained air content and water retentivity shown by the mortars. \n\n \n\n Bulk density and values of spread in the flow table of mortars are presented in \n\nFigure 6. 5. Differences on the average bulk density are minor, but ash-containing \n\nformulations tend to be slightly more compact. Ash particles are relatively smaller than S2 \n\nones and the mixes are thicker. As a consequence, the flowability of ash-containing mixes \n\ntends to decrease. Anyway differences are minor and easily adjustable if required. \n\nSpecifications recommend the preparation of mixes that show spread values between 140 \n\nand 170 mm (Table 6. 3). \n\n The replacement of S2 by BA and TBA did not influence meaningfully the air \n\ncontent and the water retentivity of the renderings (Table 6. 5). The low samples standard \n\ndeviation indicates that the data tends to be very close to the expected. They were \n\ncomprehended between 17.5 to 19.5% in case of air content and 95 to 97.6% in case of \n\nwater retentivity. It is observed that the air content of samples tends to decrease with the \n\nlower value higher value SD* lower value higher value SD*\n\nREF 19.0 19.5 0.25 97.54 97.67 0.09\n\nBA50 18.0 18.0 0.00 96.24 96.35 0.08\n\nBA100 18.0 18.5 0.25 97.18 97.24 0.04\n\nTBA50 18.0 18.0 0.00 94.98 95.02 0.03\n\nTBA100 17.5 18.0 0.25 97.15 97.36 0.15\n\nSD* (Standard Deviation)\n\nWater Retentivity (%)Air Content  (%)\nSamples\n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n108 \n \n\nreplacement material when compared to REF. In case of water retentivity, it decreases \n\nwhen BA and TBA is added in relation to REF, but increases between than when the \n\ncontent of replaced material increases. \n\n \nFigure 6. 5. Apparent density and values of spread in the flow table of the mortars. \n\n Hardened state properties \n\n Figure 6. 6 shows the amount of chlorides extracted from the mortars cured for 90 \n\ndays. Hypothetically, the increase of BA and TBA levels should enhance the concentration \n\nof chlorides, especially when non-treated BA ashes are used. \n\n However, the extraction of soluble components from a solid matrix is strongly \n\ninfluenced by physical and microstructural parameters, which certainly determine the \n\naccess and percolation of the leaching media through the material. As expected, REF \n\nshows the lowest level of chlorides, and an increase is noticed for samples containing 50% \n\nash. The pre-treatment of the ash seems efficient in minimising the contents of chlorides \n\nextracted from the mortars, particularly in those containing 100% replacement. Figure 6. 7 \n\nshows values of compressive strength of specimens cured for 7 and 28 days. In general \n\nvalues tend to increase with the use ashes but differences are minor (0.1-0.3 MPa) in \n\ncomparison to REF. This slight increase could result from the better compactness of the \n\nsamples. \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n109 \n \n\n \nFigure 6. 6. Amount of chlorides leached from mortars cured for 90 days. \n\n Anyway, all samples comply with the standard required limit of 3.5 MPa, also \n\nrepresented (dotted line) in Figure 6. 7. We also determined the dynamic elasticity modulus \n\n(E) and values are shown in Figure 6. 8. This property expresses the stiffness of the \n\nmaterial and like other mechanical properties depends on the microstructural development \n\nof the mortar that is controlled by the hydration extent, and by the arrangement of particles \n\n(compactness). Morphological details like size, shape and rugosity of grains are then \n\nimportant. \n\n \nFigure 6. 7. Compressive strength of mortars cured for 7 and 28 days. \n\nThe water:cement and cement:aggregates ratios are also obviously important \n\n[Atahan et al., 2009; Atahan et al., 2011]. Variation of elasticity modulus was not very \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n110 \n \n\nexpressive (9.1-10.65 GPa) but tends to increase in ash-containing mortars (BA and TBA). \n\nThis tendency follows the observed relative differences in the compressive strength. \n\n \nFigure 6. 8. Elasticity modulus of mortars cured for 28 days. The dotted line gives the required minimum \n\nvalue. \n\n \nFigure 6. 9. Values of unrestrained shrinkage of mortars along the time. Minimum and maximum values are \n\nshown at 28 days curing. \n\nFinally, the unrestrained shrinkage of mortars registered upon curing was also \n\nevaluated (see Figure 6. 9), since the control of this parameter is relevant to avoid cracking. \n\nValues are strongly dependent on the microstructure development upon curing [Thomas &amp; \n\nJennings, 2003; Jennings &amp; Xi, 1994; Garboczi, 1993]. The measured shrinkage is the \n\nresultant of autogenous and drying contributions. The autogenous shrinkage is due to the \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n111 \n \n\nself-desiccation of the mixture during hydration, while the drying shrinkage occurs due to \n\nthe evaporation of water from the mixture to the environment. Registered values after 28 \n\ndays curing give the following sequence: TBA100>BA100>BA50>TBA50>REF (Figure \n\n6. 9) meaning that the use of ashes as S2 replacement tends to induce stronger dimensional \n\nchanges. Shrinkage of TBA100 and BA100 mortars is, respectively, ~19% and ~13% \n\nhigher than that of REF formulation, but even so they stay below the specified limit. In \n\ncomparison to S2 aggregate, the ashes might show (incipient) hydraulic characteristics due \n\nto the Ca-rich surface layer and to the presence of calcium silicates. This means that ash \n\nparticles are not as inert as the conventional sand. \n\n6.4 Conclusions \n\n The use of bottom ash generated by burning biomass in bubbling fluidized \n\ncombustors as replacement of conventional sand used as coarse aggregate of industrial \n\nrendering-mortars is technologically feasible. In general this substitution does not induce \n\nnegative impact on the relevant properties and formulations accomplish with required \n\nspecifications. The as-collected ash shows suitable particle size distribution and only the \n\nchlorides content deserve control and potential treatment. The simple washing process \n\nindustrially tested revealed to be very effective in reducing the amount (by about 60%) of \n\nsoluble chlorides in the ash. This application could avoid sending thousand tons of ashes \n\nfor landfilling, with obvious environmental advantages. Moreover, economic savings might \n\nbe achieved by mortar producers, due to the replacement of treated and calibrated sand. \n\nFurther tests covering durability issues of formulations produced under optimized \n\nconditions (including the ash content) should be performed in the future to validate this \n\nrecycling alternative. \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT \n\n The authors acknowledge Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT- Portugal) \n\nfor the financial support (SFRH/BD/75182/2010 - PhD grant and the project PTDC/AAC-\n\nAMB/098112/2008 - Bias-to-soil - Biomass ash: Characteristics in relation to its origin, \n\ntreatment and application to soil) and Saint Gobain/Weber-cimenfix company for \n\nlaboratory and materials support. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n7  BOTTOM ASH FROM BIOMASS COMBUSTION \nIN BFB AND ITS USE IN ADHESIVE-MORTARS \n\nR.C.E.

Aiming to investigate its potential for being used as alternative aggregate in \n\ncementitious-adhesive mortar (CAM), formulations were produced by replacing \n\ncommercial sand by equivalent mass of 25, 50 and 100 wt% of bottom ash. CAM \n\nproperties were measured in fresh and hardened conditions. The bottom ash effect on the \n\ntensile adhesion strength (TAS) was investigated on samples cured under four distinct \n\nconditions. Macro and microstructural analysis were carried out to identify the influence of \n\nwetting capability and transference area in the TAS. Results revealed that high ashes levels \n\ncause relevant changes in TAS, particularly those evaluated after 30 minutes of open time. \n\nHowever, within reasonable limits, the effects are minor and acceptable. This recycling \n\nroute seems feasible, since it combines environmental benefits with economic advantages \n\nfor the adhesive mortar producers in the sense they can use BA as raw material, saving a \n\nnatural resource; this recycling option is also important since can avoid one waste \n\nlandfilling.  \n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n115 \n \n\n7.1  Introduction \n\n To supply the demand for energy of national power grid, Portugal has been \n\noperating forestry biomasses fuelled thermal power plants (TPP) and forestry biomass co-\n\nfired power plants. This country has an important set of biomass TPP and cogeneration \n\nplants, mostly with bubbling fluidized bed combustors (BFBC, 30 to 120 MWth). Most of \n\nthese industrial units are using as fuel a mixture of residual forest biomass (RFB \u2013 resultant \n\nfrom activities of industries, i.e. pulp and paper mill, such as the preparation of feedstock \n\nand forest maintenance) acquired to local or regional forestry harvesting operators working \n\naround the location of the TPP. However, most of this RFB is delivered to the thermal \n\nplants and used as fuel without a proper quality control of the biomass, and related to \n\ninappropriate practices during RFB harvesting at the forest. \n\nThe main thermal and cogeneration power plants in Portugal use bubbling fluidized \n\nbed combustion and a variety of forest biomass residues is mainly derived of Eucalyptus \n\nglobulus and Pinus pinaster [Tarelho et al., 2012]. The combustion of forest biomass \n\ngenerates ashes as solid wastes. Presently, most of the biomass ash produced in thermal \n\npower plants is either disposal of in landfill or recycled on agricultural or forest fields, and \n\nmost times those go on without any form of control. On the other hand, concerning that \n\ndisposal cost of biomass ashes is arising, and that biomass ash volumes are also increasing \n\nworldwide, a sustainable ash management has to be established [Rajamma et al., 2009]. A \n\nschematic view of the ash flows generated in a bubbling fluidised bed combustor is \n\npresented in figure 1. This same figure also describes the basic operations implemented for \n\npotential further valorization of generated wastes. According to Obernberger et al (1997), \n\nfor achieving a sustainable biomass to energy strategy it is essential to close the material \n\nfluxes and to integrate the biomass ashes within the natural cycles. Approximately 480 \n\nmillion tons of ash from biomass combustion is being generated worldwide annually \n\n[Vassilev et al., 2012]. This quantity is becoming comparable to that of coal ash, namely \n\n780 million ton produced per year at present [Izquierdo and Queirol, 2012]. Due to the \n\nstrict environmental regulations imposed by the environmental regulatory bodies, \n\nlandfilling of forest biomass ashes has becoming more difficult and this scenario is an \n\nopportunity to study and perspective diverse recycling ways for such waste [Cheah and \n\nRamli, 2012]. The ash characteristics are influenced by biomass characteristics, the soil \n\nconditions where the biomass has been collected, the combustion techniques, the operation \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n116 \n \n\nconditions during combustion (temperature, stoichiometry, air staging, and additives) and \n\nthe gas cleaning systems [Vassilev et al., 2010; Latva-Somppi et al., 1998; Dahl et al., \n\n2009; Steenary and Fedje, 2010].  \n\nThe specific ash researched in this work has been generated when periodic discharges of \n\nthe bed are performed, namely bottom ash. The periodic discharges are performed to \n\nmaintain the bed particle size distribution and to avoid bed agglomeration (a phenomenon \n\nassociated with inappropriate fluidization which could lead to the fluidised bed collapse \n\n[Bartels et al., 2008]). In general, the relative high level of inert material present in the \n\nbiomass used in Portuguese BFBC plants enhances the frequency of bed discharges, \n\nmeaning that bottom ashes have low residence time (<5 days) in the BFBC when compared \n\nwith results reported for other installations using BFBC [Latva-Somppi et al., 1998; \n\nTarelho et al., 2011]. The bottom ash from BFBC has the code 100124 according to \n\nEuropean List of Wastes and the search for recycling or reuse alternatives of such residue \n\nis an hot topic and a serious need. A reasonable number of recent investigations report the \n\nuse of ashes for distinct applications: masonry products, low and medium-strength \n\nconcrete, road pavement, blended cements, adsorbents, and ceramics [Rajammaet al., 2009; \n\nMen\u00e9ndez et al., 2014; NCASI, 1993; Wang et al., 2008; Alonso and Palomo, 2001; \n\nRajamma et al., 2012; Yip et al., 2005;  Wang and Baxter, 2007; Siddique, 2010]. \n\nHowever, as far as we know, the use of bottom ash in CAM is not well documented. \n\nCementitious-adhesive is a technical product, namely a mixed-binder mortar specially \n\nmade from a combination of lime, sand, and water, as well as from other types of \n\ncementitious products, mainly composed of sand and different mineral fillers, inorganic or \n\norganic binders, and additives depending on the use. This product must assure the adhesion \n\nbetween tiles (ceramic or ornamental stones) and the concrete wall. Cementitious-adhesive \n\nmortars (CAM) role is particularly challenging for the fixation of large and dense samples, \n\nas occurred in the last decades due to the evolution on tile industry [An\u00e7id et al., 2005; \n\nWetzel et al., 2012]. Their performance depends on the content, quality and the interaction \n\nbetween the components [Mansur et al., 2009; \u00d6hama, 1995; Jenni et al., 2005; Jenni et al., \n\n2006]. CAM hold up well to outdoor temperatures, but dries hard and may be prone to \n\ncracking or expansion if not applied properly or if subjected to temperature extremes or \n\nground heave. \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n117 \n \n\nSchulze (1999) tested the influence of water-cement ratio and of the cement content \n\non the properties of polymer-modified mortars. Within certain limits, the water-cement \n\nratio exerts a smaller effect on the adhesion strength of the material, but the relative \n\namount of cement in the mixture is a crucial parameter. In the fresh state condition, the \n\ngeneration of a skin (film) on the external surface of the mortar having suitable gluing \n\nproperties drastically influences the bond strength between the adhesive and the tile \n\n[B\u00fchler et al., 2013]. This mechanism is rather complex and its study is far from its \n\nconclusion. \n\nIn the present work, raw bottom ash from forest residues combustion was \n\ncharacterized as received and its particle size distribution was compared with 2 bottom \n\nashes generated in Thermal Power Plants (TPP) with the same type of technology (BFBC). \n\nThe aim of this part of the work was to assess the influence of biomass characteristics in \n\nthe bottom ash quality, namely particle size distribution and also to report the significant \n\nbottom ash high level amount generated when compared to other plants and finally \n\nemphasizes the need of treatment of bottom ash to be used as replacement material in the \n\nconstruction sector. After, the tested bottom ash was evaluated according to Decision \n\n2003/33/CE and Decree-Law n\u00ba 152/2002 (Decree-Law n\u00ba 152/2002 was repealed by \n\nDecree-Law n\u00ba 183/2009 and rectified by Decree-Law n\u00ba 84/2011). The waste \n\nclassification for landfilling purposes was then established.  \n\nIn general, the bottom bed ash from a BFBC are composed mostly by silica (quartz) \n\nsand particles, with particle size from the few micrometers until some millimeters, being \n\nthe mean particle size (around 0.950 mm) very similar to that of conventional silica sand \n\nused in CAM formulations. Considering this fact, the bottom ash from a BFBC was treated \n\n(by sieving) and tested as partial replacement of the conventional sand used in CAM. The \n\nbottom ash treatment consisted in sieving in order to remove coarse (> 1.00 mm) and fine \n\n(&lt;0.25 mm) particles, that are often introduced in the combustor mixed with the biomass \n\nfuel, that can contain important amounts of inert material (soil and little stones) mixed. The \n\ntests were performed in the fresh and hardened state. The wetting capability and \n\ntransference capacity of fresh mortars, as well as the ultimate tensile adhesion strength \n\n(TAS) developed upon curing in distinct conditions, was evaluated. Economic savings \n\nmight be achieved by cementitious-adhesive producers, due to the replacement of \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n118 \n \n\nexpensive calibrated sand, considering that at least four thousand tonnes per year of this \n\nsand is used only by one mortar producer [Modolo et al., 2013]. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 7. 1. Schematic view of the ash flows generated in the BFBC, including the basic operations \n\nimplemented for potential further valorization. \n\n7.2  Methodology \n\n Raw bottom ash here studied was collected from a 90 MWth BFBC (bubbling \n\nfluidised bed combustor, namely Thermal Power Plant 3 (TPP_3)) located in the centre of \n\nPortugal. It burns forest biomass residues, namely eucalyptus bark and remains from \n\nlogging activities. The temperature of the bubbling bed ranges from 800\u00baC to 900\u00baC. The \n\nraw BA was directly collected in the ashtray of the combustor, schematically represented in \n\nFigure 7.1.  \n\n7.2.1  Characterization of raw BA \n\n Particle size distribution of BA from TPP_1, 2 and 3 were obtained by manually \n\nsieving according to EN 933-1: 2000. The chemical composition of raw BA from TPP_3 \n\nwas determined by X-Ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy \u2013XRF (Panalytical Axios \n\nspectrometer), while the crystalline phases were detected by X-ray diffraction \u2013 XRD \n\n(RIGAKU-Geiger flex diffractometer).

Laser diffraction using Coulter LS analyzer was also used to obtain the \n\nparticle size distribution. Gravimetric and differential thermal analyses (TG/DTA \u2013 \n\nSetaram, Labsys) were used to evaluate the amount of unburnt (organic) components. \n\nConcerning the presence of metals, the hazardous potential of BA was determined by using \n\ntwo techniques: (i) digestion with aqua-regia (HCl:HNO3, 3:1, v/v) and (ii) leaching \n\naccording to DIN 38414-S4. In this case the as received waste was used to prepare an \n\neluate (100 g of dried material was immersed in 1 liter of distilled water). The suspension \n\nwas stirred for 24 hours and then filtered. Then, 100 mL of such cleaned eluate was \n\ntitrated. Metal contents were determined by ICP (Inductively Coupled Plasma) in an \n\napparatus Jobin Yvon - Sequential NSPL upgrade model (J4/200). Chlorides were \n\nestimated by the Argentometric method (CHLORIDE, 4500-Cl-; Standard Methods \n\nCommittee, 1997), while sulphates were estimated by gravimetry (SULFATE, 4500-SO4\n-2; \n\nignition of residue, Standard Methods Committee, 1997). In this case, sample was dried, \n\nweighed and dissolved in diluted HCl. Barium chloride solution was added in excess to \n\nprecipitate barium sulphate, and the precipitate was digested in the hot solution (between \n\n80 \u2013 90\u00baC). The precipitate was filtered through a paper filter and was then ignited (at 800 \n\n\u00baC for 4 hours) for complete combustion. Difference between the weight of the sample and \n\nof the precipitate gives the percentage of sulphates. \n\n7.2.2 Characterization of materials used in cementitious-adhesive application \n\n Raw BA from TPP_3 was sieved (between 250 and 1000\u00b5m) in a lab-scale \n\nequipment to adjust the particle size distribution to the one of the commercial aggregate \n\n(sand) that will be replaced normally used in this type of mortars; Raw Bottom Ash was \n\nhere identified as BA. Particle size distribution of CAM components were obtained by \n\nmanually sieving according to EN 933-1: 2000. The chemical composition of BA, \n\nOrdinary Portland Cement type I, S1 (finer sand) and S2 (coarse sand) particles was also \n\ndetermined using were also X-Ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy \u2013XRF (Panalytical Axios \n\nspectrometer), while the crystalline phases were detected by X-ray diffraction \u2013 XRD \n\n(RIGAKU-Geiger flex diffractometer). \n\n7.2.3 CAM formulations and characterization \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n120 \n \n\n The formulations studied are presented in Table 7.1. The raw materials brand and \n\ncontent were suggested by the company which intents to improve forward the valorization \n\nsolution using its own specific formulations. The copolymer powder is a vinyl acetate and \n\nethylene which is dispersible in water and has good saponification resistance. CEM II/A-L \n\n42.5R is used in lower quantity and its function is to improve the cementitious-adhesive \n\nbehaviour in aggressive environments. Apart from CEM I, the fine sand (S1) is the \n\naggregate with highest content used in these cementitious-adhesive formulations and its \n\nfunction is related with the final product texture and type of application. The water content \n\nof samples was defined according to the workability of the adhesives observed through the \n\nslip (results comprehended from 0 to 1.0 mm). The adhesive\u2019s preparation was developed \n\naccording to EN 12004: 2007+A1 (Adhesives for tiles - Requirements, evaluation of \n\nconformity, classification and designation). It includes: \n\n(a) Hand mixing the water with the solids for 15 seconds;  \n\n(b) Mixing for 30 seconds at low rotation speed (60 rpm);  \n\n(c) Stopping for 1 minute;  \n\n(d) Mixing again for 1 minute under the same low speed and,  \n\n(e) Keep the mixture in stand by for 2 minutes;  \n\n(f) Mixing for the last 15 seconds at low rotation speed. After mixing, the fresh paste was \n\napplied on concrete plates in two steps: as a first contact layer with a thickness \n\ncorresponding to the surface base layer (approximately 2 mm), which then was trowelled \n\nrepeatedly with a toothed notched trowel (profiled 6x6x6 mm). The standards used in the \n\ncharacterisation of mortars are presented in Table 7.2. \n\nTable 7. 1.

It is measured through the downward movement of the tile \n\n(weight = 200g), corresponding to a 20kg/m2. The distance between the top (where the tile \n\nwas applied) and the place where the tile stopped after 10 minutes of testing is considered \n\nthe final result, given in millimetres [EN 1308: 2007]. \n\nWetting capability and transference \n\n The wetting capability is estimated as the contact area (%) between the \n\nmortar/adhesive and a glassy sheet of 25 cm2. It gives a qualitative estimation of the \n\ncapacity shown by the adhesive mortar to embed the surface of a ceramic or glass tile. A \n\nsquared piece of glass (5x5x0.5 cm) is pushed by a metal piece of 2 kg against the combed \n\nadhesive during 30 seconds; afterwards and before removing the glass, the area covered by \n\nthe adhesive is visually inspected and determined by an image editing software that allows \n\nthe calculation of specific selected areas. The test is repeated 10, 20 and 30 min after the \n\nadhesive layer has been combed. This test is described by the European Standard EN \n\n1347:2007. \n\nTransference measurements \n\n After removal the glassy piece from the substrate with the adhesive, the quantity \n\nof mortar that was transferred to the tile is measured given the so called transference value. \n\nThe evolution of the tiles surface coverage by the adhesive mortar with the curing time \n\ngives an estimation of the adhesion loss due to hardening process. Values were correlated \n\nwith tensile adhesion strength evaluated after an open time of 30 minutes. Again, the area \n\nvalues were estimated by using the same imaging software. \n\nTensile Adhesion Strength \u2013 pull-off test \n\n The adhesive strength is determined as the maximum tensile strength supported by \n\nthe material under a load that is applied perpendicular to the surface being tested. The pull-\n\noff test is classified as a near-to-surface, partially destructive method [Ramos et al., 2012]. \n\nThe tensile load is applied by means of a defined pull-head plate glued to the testing \n\nsurface. \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n122 \n \n\n A thin layer of the adhesive is applied on the concrete slab (substrate) with a \n\nstraight edge trowel. On the top of this first layer another thicker layer of the adhesive is \n\ndeposited and combed with a notched trowel (having 6 x 6 mm notches at 12 mm centers). \n\nIt was hold at an angle of approximately 60\u00b0 to the substrate at a right angle to one edge of \n\nthe slab and drawn across the slab parallel to that edge (in a straight line). After 5 min, the \n\nceramic tiles (of porcelain type, having water absorption ? 0,5 % by mass, unglazed and \n\ncovered with plain, matt glaze, with dimensions of 5x5x0.5 cm) were laid in, loaded with 2 \n\nkg for 30 seconds one by one. The minimum adhesion defined by CEN specifications (EN \n\n1348: 2007) is ? 0.5 MPa for samples cured under distinct conditions (see below). \n\n(i) Dry curing (28d, 23\u00baC, 50%RH): samples are cured for 28 days in a climate chamber \n\n(23\u00baC\u00b12 and 50%\u00b15 relative humidity). These conditions are considered the standard ones. \n\nThen, pull-head plates are bonded (square metallic plates, with dimensions of 50 x 50 mm \n\nand thickness of 10 mm) to the tiles by using a proper high strength adhesive resin (epoxy). \n\nAfter more 24 h storage in standard conditions the tensile adhesion strength is evaluated \n\nunder a load that is applied at constant rate of 250 N/s. \n\n(ii) Wet curing (7d, 23\u00baC, 50%RH + 21d, inside water at temperature of 20\u00baC\u00b12) : now the \n\nsamples cured for 7 days in standard conditions were then immersed in water (at 20\u00baC \u00b12) \n\nfor another 21 days. Before testing the adhesion, according to the conditions already \n\ndescribed, pieces are wiped with a cloth. \n\n(iii) Heat curing (14d, 23\u00baC, 50%RH + 14d, 70\u00baC +1d, 23 \u00ba C, 50% RH): samples are \n\npreviously cured for 14 days in standard conditions and then are placed inside an air-\n\ncirculating oven at 70 \u00b1 3\u00b0C for another 14 days. \n\n(iv) TAS after 30\u2019 open time (28d, 23\u00baC, 50%RH): the open time is defined as the period \n\nduring which the tiles might be applied to the adhesive (i.e., the time during which the \n\nadhesive surface remains \u201ctacky\u201d to the touch) [Bentz et al., 2008; Oberste-Padtberg and \n\nSieksmeier, 2007]. Measurements were performed according to the EN1346:1999 standard. \n\nThis means that samples are cured for 28 days in standard conditions, then the adhesive \n\nmortar is applied and samples are tested after 30 minutes (the designated open time). \n\nFailure patterns \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n123 \n \n\n The failure patterns of tested samples were also observed. AF-T indicates failure \n\nbetween tile and adhesive, CF-S is used to define the cohesive failure at the interface \n\nbetween adhesive and substrate and CF-A defines the failure within the adhesive layer as \n\nspecified by EN 12004: 1999. Failure patterns are schematically illustrated in Figure 7.2. \n\nTable 7. 2. Standards used to characterize the cementitious adhesives mortars. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 7. 2. Failure patterns observed in this study (as specified by EN 12004).  (1) Failure pattern AF-T, \n\nfailure in tile adhesive-tile interface. (2) Failure pattern CF-A, failure within tile adhesive layer. (3) Cohesive \nfailure in substrate CF-S. \n\n7.3  Results and Discussion \n\n7.3.1  Characterization of raw BA \n\n Figure 7.3 presents the particle size distribution of raw BA (before sieving), BA \n\n(sieved) and the other two sands used in the whole work. S1 is the finest sand used in the \n\nformulations and S2 the coarse one, having the mean size around 400 \u00b5m and 1025 \u00b5m, \n\nrespectively, while BA (before sieving) and BA (before sieving) is 900 \u00b5m and 950 \u00b5m, \n\nrespectively. In case of BA (before sieving) the existence of almost 60% of particles \n\ndiameter between 0.25 \u2013 1.0 mm is reasonable in the light of the fact that, in fluidized bed \n\nboiler furnaces, the combustion bed material, silica sand, consists of calibrated sand which \n\nmust be kept constant to guaranty the height of bed. From the utilization point of view, \n\nthese particles (between 0.25 and 1.0 mm) can be of great potential because of their similar \n\nState Test Unit Standard\n\nApparent Density EN 1015-6:1998\n\nSlip mm EN 1308:2007\n\nWetting capability %\n\nTranference %\n\nTensile Adhesion Strength (after 7, 14 and 28 days )\n\nTensile Adhesion Strength after water immersion\n\nTensile Strength after heat ageing \n\nTensile Adhesion Strength (OT-Open time 30')  EN 1346:1999\n\nEN 1347:2007\n\nFresh\n\nMPa\nEN 1348:2007\n\nHardened\n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n124 \n \n\nparticle size with the calibrated sand used as aggregate for the tested type of cementitious-\n\nadhesive. Other types of bottom ash [Dahl et al., 2009; Dahl et al., 2010] can differ \n\nsignificantly in particle size range compared with the BA tested here, thus suggesting that \n\nin those cases lower amounts of particles from those ashes can be used for this application. \n\nThe percentage of material (particles) retained in the sieve with 2 mm mesh is in the order \n\nof 1% and in the sieve 0.25 mm mesh is in order of 65%wt [Dahl et al., 2009]. \n\nNevertheless, an appropriate treatment (sieving) could guarantee the use of a fraction of \n\nbottom ash from bubbling fluidised bed combustors in mortars formulations by \n\nreplacement of the conventional sand as aggregate, because they contain always an \n\nimportant fraction of particles with size range between 0.25 and 1.0 mm, and thus of \n\ninterest for these formulations. Also, considering the typical operating conditions of \n\nbubbling fluidised bed combustors using residual forest biomass as fuel, the chemical \n\ncomposition of bottom ash, for example, in terms of organic matter, soluble salts, \n\nchlorides, seems to be within the standard specifications of the material to be used as \n\naggregate and it is not expected the promotion of deleterious effects in this type of products \n\n(cement-based mortars) [Modolo et al., 2013]. Considering this fact, raw BA was sieved, \n\ncharacterized and tested as aggregate partially replacing S2 in CAM formulations (figure \n\n7.3). The enrichment with fine and coarse particles relative to the original sand bed in the \n\nPortuguese TPPs can be explained in result of characteristics of forest biomass residues \n\nused as fuel, namely the inert material. So, this fact is completely associated with the \n\nbiomass quality, mainly related with stones and soil particles contamination of forest \n\nresidues during harvesting transport and their handling [Modolo et al., 2014]. Another \n\nconcern when compare both scenery is about ashes amount. Dahl et al (2010)] referred that \n\nTPP (246MW) produced about 15.430 tonnes of ashes in 2009, which 2580 tonnes was \n\nbottom ash. Meanwhile, the specific Portuguese TPP (90MWth) where the studied BA is \n\ngenerated produces around 6.000 tonnes/year what demonstrates the strong influence of \n\nbiomass quality on the bottom ash characteristics mainly in terms of amount. Decision \n\n2003/33/CE establishes for waste acceptance in each landfill type (inert, non-hazardous \n\nand hazardous) based on both the characteristics of the waste and leachate acquired by EN \n\n14405  and refers that each member state must define which L/S ratio to use. In Portugal, \n\nthe criteria for landfill deposition of inert and hazardous wastes are those of Decision \n\n2003/33/CE with ratio L/S of 10l/kg. For non-hazardous waste, the criteria are defined on \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n125 \n \n\nDecree-Law 152/2002 with leachate obtained by DIN 38414-S4 (L/S=10 l/kg). Neither \n\nDecision 2003/33/CE nor Decree-Law 152/2002 establish legal limits for Mn and Fe, but \n\nboth elements were quantified together others minor elements objectifying information \n\nreport. The results for minor elements are presented in figure 7.4 and legal limit for waste \n\nacceptance in each landfill type and BA results are presented in table 7.3.  \n\n \n\nFigure 7. 3. Grain size distribution determined according to EN 933:1/2000. \n\n \nComparing values obtained with the limits stated in Decision 2003/33/CE, can \n\nverify that values of Cd (0.77 mg/kg), Cr total (9.1 mg/kg), Ni (3.85 mg/kg) and Zn (17.8 \n\nmg/kg) exceed the legal limit for inert wastes. The pH (12) and nitrates concentration (2.5 \n\nmg/l) are near the limits defined for non-hazardous wastes, so deserves control and \n\nprecaution to not be surpassed. Recycling this waste in cement- based mortars/concrete, as \n\na replacement of natural aggregates, might be an interesting alternative, since it is perfectly \n\naligned with EU directives recommending solutions to transform the waste into a resource \n\n[Horizon 2020, 2014; Schiessler et al., 2007]. The use of cementitious-adhesive mortars \n\nmight additionally constitute an added-value valorisation solution. \n\nS2 and BA particles are microscopically illustrated in figure 7.5. Images \u201ca\u201d and \n\n\u201cb\u201d emphasize the main physical differences between the two materials in terms of \n\ndimension, shape and surface. In general, S2 particles show smoother contours and have \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n126 \n \n\nmore rounded and homogeneous shapes, while are larger in size than BA grains. These last \n\nones show clearly a large diversity of shapes. Images \u201cc\u201d and \u201cd\u201d present BA images \n\nfocusing the surface of the particle. It is possible to observe that BA presents some crystals \n\nspread out on the surface, certainly attached upon burning or as impurities during the ash \n\nmanipulation. \n\n \nFigure 7. 4.

Otherwise, the remaining unburnt matter should decompose in \n\nthat temperature region. \n\n7.3.2  Characterization of materials used in cementitious-adhesive application \n\n Ozkahraman and Isik (2005) highlighted that the fundamental requirement of the \n\ntile adhesive mortar is its adherence and durability and proved that the properties of \n\nadhesives are affected by the chemical and mineralogical composition of the aggregates. In \n\nfigure 7.6 (XRD results) It can be observed that S1 and S2 are basically quartz-sand and Ba \n\npresented approximately 90% SiO2 in its composition. Other 10% of crystalline substances \n\nare minerals which do not represent a negative aspect on the proposed application, calcite i. \n\ne., is a material frequently used in several types of cements and cement-mortars, as filler or \n\nas raw material used in clinker production. The calcium silicate mineral Larnite found is \n\nvestiges.  \n\n7.3.3 Characterization of CAM \n\nValues of slip and apparent density determined on adhesive mortars are presented \n\nin table 7.5.The apparent density tends to slightly increase with BA content in the mortars. \n\nThis fact can be associated to the particle size distribution of the ash-containing mixtures, \n\nthat when S2 is replaced by BA produces mixtures that require less amount of water to \n\nassure a similar workability (see BA50 and BA100 formulations) leading to a better final \n\ncompactness.  \n\nFigure 7.7 illustrates the wetability of the glassy surface shown by the tested \n\nformulations as a function of exposure time (10, 20, 30 and 40 min after application). It is \n\nquite evident the gradual weatability lost along the time. According to B\u00fchler et al (2013) \n\nthere is the formation of a top skin that hardens quickly than the interior of the material and \n\nit will reduce its deformation and gluing capacity. The formation of such layer depends on \n\nthe mortar formulation, nature of the substrate, application technique, and also by the \n\nclimatic. It is found that after 20 minutes REF sample already denotes deficiencies in \n\ncovering the tile surface, while BA-containing mortars show good wettability. The \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n \n\n130 \n \n\nhomogeneous particle size distribution of BA associated with the roughness of its surface \n\nmight explain this increase. Indeed, less finer particles demanding less water retard skin \n\nformation, leading to better transference capability. B\u00fchler et al (2013) also confirmed this \n\nfact by testing different mortar formulations and observing that water content could retard \n\nthe skin formation.  \n\n \nFigure 7. 7. Photograph of glass plate embedded during the wetting capability test of cementitious-adhesives \n\nas a function of exposure time (10, 20, 30 and 40 min after the mortars were combed). \n\n On the other hand, in terms of fresh state behavior, these mortars should present a \n\nslip value close to 0 mm. So, looking at the slip results, the fact that less water is needed \n\nwhen BA is introduced leads to lower slip values in BA50 and BA100 (0 to 1 mm) together \n\nwith a good wetting capability along the exposure time after combed. \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n \n\n131 \n \n\nFigure 7.8 shows pictures of the tile surface covered by the mortars, used to estimate the \n\ntransference capacity. This same figure was analyzed by image software, which enabled \n\nthe quantification of the areas covered by the mortar. In figure 8 the area calculation was \n\nmade on the basis of the total area of each tile (25 cm2). What is observed is a steady \n\ndecreasing in the transference capacity of the mortar with open time. REF presents very \n\nhigh loss of transference capacity at 30 and 40 minutes of the test (in order of 46 and 85% \n\nof loss respectively). However, BA25, BA50 and BA100 showed values even higher than \n\n70% transference capacity after 40 minutes of the open time test. The loss of transference \n\ncapability of the material 20 minutes after the application could have serious implications \n\nin the TAS, or as longer is the exposure time of the mortar, the lower is the adhesion of the \n\nceramic piece to the mortar. \n\n \nFigure 7. 8. Ceramic-tiles after transference test of cementitious-adhesive and calculated non-filled area of \n\ntiles (Considering 25 cm2 of total area per each ceramic tile). \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n \n\n132 \n \n\n What could justify the difference between the reference mortar (REF) and other \n\nformulations containing BA is the fact that its surface presents a roughness and an overall \n\nnumber of smaller particles compared to S2, which may have promoted a better \n\ndistribution of the cement paste in the aggregate particles surface increasing the interfacial \n\ncontact between mortar and ceramic tile. \n\nTable 7. 5. Slip of cementitious-adhesive mortars.\n\n \n\nHardened state properties \n\nThe tensile adhesion strength of samples cured in distinct conditions (standard, wet \n\nand heat) is given in table 6. The increase of adhesion with the incorporation of BA may be \n\njustified by two factors: (i) the increase of interfacial contact between the adhesive and the \n\nceramic tile; (ii) the slight lower water content of BA-containing samples (water/cement \n\nratio is 0.55 while the one of REF is 0.56). \n\nUpon curing in standard conditions (28d, 23\u00baC, 50%RH) we can observe that adhesion \n\ntensile strength proportionally increases with BA content, despite some uncertainty on the \n\nevolution given by the expressive standard deviation of measurements of REF and BA50 \n\nsamples.  \n\nThe adhesive strength of the entire system is dominated by the properties of the tile-\n\nmortar interface [Jenni et al., 2005]. According to Chew (1999) the reduction of the \n\ncapillary water, especially in the region near the interface between the adhesive and the \n\nsubstrate, will cause the flocculation of polymer particles and the appearance of a \n\ncontinuous close-packed layer of these particles at the surface of cement gel-hydrates. With \n\nwater withdrawal caused by cement hydration (accelerated upon curing at higher \n\ntemperature), the closed-packed layer of polymer particles tends to coalesce into \n\ncontinuous films or membranes, that will efficiently bind the cement hydrated particles \n\ntogether and form a monolithic network in which the polymer phase interpenetrates \n\nthroughout the cement hydrate phase [\u00d6hama et al., 1986]. Table 7.6 also presents the \n\ntensile adhesion strength of samples cured in water for 21 days, after being 7 days placed \n\nunder the same standard conditions (23\u00b0 C, 50% RH). The immersion in water strongly \n\nSample Slip (mm) Apparent density (g/cm\n3\n)\n\nREF 0.0 1.484\nBA25 0.0 1.487\nBA50 0.0 - 1.0 1.506\nBA100 0.0 - 1.0 1.525\n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n \n\n133 \n \n\ndiminishes the adhesion of samples. The results obtained show that BA formulations \n\npresented a slightly increase of TAS in immersion conditions when compared to REF. \n\nDeveloped studies [Jenni et al., 2006] focused in changes in physical properties of \n\nimmersed adhesive-mortars, revealed that the strength decrease is attributed to causes \n\nrelated not only to cement hydration but also to volume changes of mortar and reversible \n\nswelling of latex films. These authors proved that in water the cellulose ether structures are \n\ncompletely dissolved. Furthermore, the adhesion strength of adhesive-mortars containing \n\npolymers is mainly dependent on the polymer content but it is less affected by the cement \n\ncontent or the water-cement ratio. Indeed, according to Schulze (1999) the adhesion \n\nstrength can be increased with high levels of cement but the influence of the polymer is \n\nstill much higher. \n\nTable 7. 6. Cementitious-adhesive adhesion strength results (MPa). \n\n \n\n In opposition to the behaviour observed in water (wet cure condition), samples tend \n\nto gain adhesion when submitted to heat curing. This gain is not very significant but there \n\nis, under this curing condition, a positive trend in tensile adhesion strength as it was also \n\nobserved by Jenni et al (2006), under prolonged storage of samples at 70 \u00baC and even at \n\n100 \u00baC. On the other hand, the evaluation of bond strength should always take into account \n\nnot only the adhesive strength values but also the type of rupture (failure patterns), in order \n\nto effectively understand the behaviour of adhesive mortars.  \n\nSamples cured for 7 and 14 days in standard conditions showed predominantly AF-T \n\nrupture (adhesive failure in the ceramic tile). However, upon prolonging the cure for 28 \n\ndays in standard conditions it was found that samples BA50 and BA100 revealed partial \n\nadhesive failure pattern [BA50 (35% AF-T and 65% CF-A), BA100 (60% AF-T and 40% \n\nCF-A)], while REF and BA25 ones only show AF-T rupture. This change is related to the \n\nobserved increase on the values of tensile adhesion strength in both higher BA content \n\nformulations, cured in this condition.  \n\nDifferences between failure patterns of samples cured in water and under heat can \n\nbe observed in figure 7.9.

According to Jenni et al (2006), the resulting failure \n\npatterns can be correlated to the final adhesive strength achieved by the tile adhesive-\n\nmortar, leading to an interface failure pattern in wet conditions or a failure trough the \n\nadhesive mortar (cohesive failure pattern) under heat curing conditions.  \n\n \nFigure 7. 9. Examples of cementitious-adhesives failure patterns commonly observed in the \n\nactual study (left image \u2013 AF-T observed on samples cured in water; right image \u2013 CF-A \nobserved on samples cured under heat). \n\n \n\nFigure 7.10 shows the relation between the adhesion strength (after 28 days of \n\ncuring in standard conditions under 30 minutes of open time) of the samples and \n\ntransference capacity results after 30 minutes of open time. Bentz et al (2008) emphasizes \n\nthat tackiness is lost due to the formation of a skin/film and reinforce the idea that a key \n\nproperty of adhesive-mortars is their open time. TAS increase with BA content increasing \n\non open time test (30\u2019). It means that there is a higher adhesive capability of the adhesive \n\nmortar that can be also related to their wetting capability and transference capacity (figures \n\n7.7 and 7.8). Formulations with BA present transference and wetting capability higher than \n\nREF not only at 30 minutes, but also at 10, 20 and 40 minutes of open time. This fact could \n\njustify the highest value of TAS obtained for this formulation in the open time test. The \n\naddition of BA retards the adhesive film formation leading to an increasing of workability \n\ntime of the product; BA also promotes an increase in the interfacial contact between \n\nadhesive and tile, consequently increasing the tensile adhesion strength of formulations \n\nwith BA in their composition.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n \n\n135 \n \n\n \nFigure 7. 10.

Increasing on the replacement amount of conventional sand by \n\nBA proportionally increases the tensile adhesion strength of the formulations in every \n\nstorage conditions (standard wet and heat curing). This result could be mainly related with \n\nthe increase of interfacial contact between the adhesive and the ceramic tile. The developed \n\ntests of wetting capability and transference demonstrate that the conventional sand (S2) \n\nreplacement by BA lead to a considerable increasing in both parameters. \n\nAbout the hardened properties of the formulations tested, the evaluation of adhesion \n\nalso involved the follow up of the failure adhesion patterns. Introduction of BA led to a \n\nshift from typical adhesive failure pattern in the tile-adhesive interface to a cohesive failure \n\npattern inside the mortar. This effect can be attributed to the increase on tensile adhesion \n\nstrength of the adhesive mortar containing BA. Another advantage in incorporating BA in \n\nthese mortars was observed in the open time test that gives indication on the tackiness of \n\n80\n\n85\n\n90\n\n95\n\n100\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\nREF 25BA 50BA 100BA\n\nTr\nan\n\nsf\ner\n\nen\nce\n\n c\nap\n\nac\nit\n\ny \nat\n\n 3\n0 \n\nm\nin\n\nu\nte\n\ns \no\n\nf \nop\n\nen\n t\n\nim\ne \n\n(%\n)\n\nT\nen\n\nsi\nle\n\n A\nd\n\nhe\nsi\n\no\nn\n\n S\ntr\n\nen\ngt\n\nh\n (\n\nM\nP\n\na)\n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n \n\n136 \n \n\nthe adhesive mortars. BA contributes to delay the adhesive film formation, thus leading to \n\nbetter adhesion results. \n\nParticle size distribution of BA could be properly adjusted to replace the \n\nconventional coarse sand aggregates used in this type of cementitious adhesive-mortar \n\nformulations. Hence, recycling of BA in adhesive mortar was found to be suitable for this \n\nkind of application without detrimental implications in terms of major chemical or physical \n\neffects on the product. It was shown that this process constitutes a valid waste valorization \n\nsolution in a construction material, also reducing the use of an important natural resource \n\n(raw coarse sand) which, in turn, contributes to increase the level of sustainability of the \n\nindustrial processes involved. Furthermore, this waste recycling solution is also important \n\nfor the pulp and paper industry and energy industry, because it contributes to avoid the \n\nlandfill disposal of one of its industrial process residues (the bottom ash from biomass \n\ncombustion), thus minimizing related environmental and economic costs. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\n The authors acknowledge Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT Portugal) \n\nfor the financial support (SFRH/BD/75182/2010-PhD grant, PTDC/AAC-AMB/ \n\n116568/2010 - BiomAshTech - Ash impacts during thermo-chemical conversion of \n\nbiomass) and also Saint-Gobain Weber company for laboratory and materials support. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n8 TREATMENT AND USE OF BOTTOM BED \nWASTE IN BIOMASS FLUIDISED BED \n\nCOMBUSTORS \nRegina C.E.

BBW particle size distribution, elemental composition (mainly \n\nSi, Ca, Al, Na, K, P and Mg) and mineralogy were evaluated considering also the influence \n\nof the characteristics of the biomass used as fuel. Biomass combustion experiments were \n\ndeveloped using a pilot-scale bubbling fluidized bed combustor. The operating conditions \n\nduring the experiments were monitored, namely the flue gas composition (CO2, O2 and \n\nCO), temperature and pressure, and compared with data collected from BFBC located in \n\ntwo industrial biomass thermal power plants. Physical, chemical and mineralogical \n\ncharacteristics of the FBS and BBW revealed that practices related with biomass handling \n\nat the forest strongly influence the BBW properties, not only in terms of coarse soil \n\nparticles addition (> 1.0 mm) but also mineralogically. However, the results obtained here \n\nindicate that by sieving of BBW it is possible to recover almost 60% of the original BBW \n\nparticles (size between 0.3 to 1.0 mm), which have properties that allow its reuse as \n\nsubstitute of FBS for bed make-up in industrial BFBC. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n139 \n \n\n8.1  Introduction \n\n Fluidized bed combustion (FBC) is recognized as the most suitable technology for \n\nbiomass combustion. FBC plants can deal with distinct fuel mixtures (e.g. different types \n\nof biomass) but might show some operating problems when the particle size distribution \n\nand type/amount of impurities in the fuel are not adjusted (Mitsui, 1997). The combustion \n\ntemperature inside the bed must be kept relatively low (usually 700\u2013900\u00b0C) in order to \n\nprevent ash sintering. Even so, this technology assures high conversion efficiency \n\n[(McKendry, 2002; Khan et al., 2009]. Problems that might appear during biomass \n\ncombustion are related to the amount of ashes being generated and their properties, with \n\npotential reflex on the energy conversion efficiency. Slagging, fouling, corrosion, and bed \n\nagglomeration are unwanted episodes. Additionally, the generated ash also requires a \n\nproper environmental [Werkelin et al., 2010; Rajamma et al., 2009]. \n\nSeveral authors consider agglomeration of bed particles as the major problem during \n\nbiomass combustion in FBC [Ohman et al., 2005; Zevenhoven-Onderwater et al., 2006; \n\nElled et al., 2013; Nuutinen et al., 2004]. According to Bartels et al. (2008) the \n\ninappropriate fluidization caused by agglomeration could lead to the fluidized bed collapse. \n\nThe bed material agglomeration and sintering are related with the sticky coatings on bed \n\nparticles formation. These coatings are formed by multiple layers of ash or ash-rich \n\ncompounds. The internal layers seem to be a sign of the composition of the bed material \n\n(sand), while the outer layers are essentially defined by the ash characteristics [Ohman et \n\nal., 2000]. In addition, certain elements segregation to the ash layers on bed sand particles \n\nhas been observed [\u00c5mand and Leckner, 2004]. The volume of ashes, their characteristics \n\nand management has been considered one of the most important issues during \n\nthermochemical conversion of biomass to energy. The type of biomass in use (i.e., forest \n\nwastes, wood, herbaceous, domestic wastes), the amount/nature of impurities (i.e., soil, \n\ninorganics), the technology and the operating conditions (e.g., bed material residence time, \n\ntemperature, etc.) determine the amount and characteristics of the ashes produced during \n\ncombustion. According to Vassilev et al. (2012) approximately 480 million ton. of ash \n\nfrom biomass combustion could be generated worldwide annually. This quantity is \n\nbecoming comparable to that of coal ash, namely 780 million ton produced per year at \n\npresent [Izquierdo and Querol, 2012]. \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n140 \n \n\n During biomass combustion in bubbling fluidized bed combustors (BFBC) two \n\nmain types of ashes are produced: bottom bed and fly ashes. The bottom bed ashes are \n\nbasically composed by a mixture of sand (mainly quartz) particles from the original bed, \n\nand by inert/inorganic components (forest soil and small stones) included in the biomass. \n\nAdditionally unburnt organic components might also be present in the ash. The \n\ncomponents of the fly ashes are similar to the previous ones, but finer enough to be aspired \n\nby the exhaustion system of the combustor. The bed sand fraction is normally much lower \n\nthan in the bottom ash, since only the original finer particles or the ones resulting from \n\nattrition and abrasion phenomena are present. During BFBC, the bottom bed ashes often \n\nrepresent the lower fraction of the total ashes produced: around 5 %wt. [Latva-Somppi et \n\nal., 1998a; Latva-Somppi et al., 1998b], 10 %wt. [Dahl et al., 2010], and 17 %wt. [Tarelho \n\net al., 2012]. However, in some Portuguese thermal plants with BFBC, the relative amount \n\nof bottom bed ashes can be as high as 50-60 %wt. [Tarelho et al., 2012]. \n\n The bottom bed waste is generated when periodic discharges of the bed are \n\nperformed: i) trying to maintain the particle size distribution and to avoid agglomeration, in \n\norder to assure the suitable fluidity and hydrodynamic conditions of the bubbling bed; ii) to \n\ndischarge the excess of solids (ash) and keep the height constant. In general, the relative \n\nhigh level of inert material present in the biomass used in Portuguese BFBC plants \n\n(Tarelho et al., 2011) enhances the frequency of bed discharges, meaning that bottom bed \n\nashes have low residence time (<5 days - see Tables 8.1 and 8.2) in the BFBC when \n\ncompared with results reported for other installations using BFBC [Latva-Somppi et al., \n\n1998a; Latva-Somppi et al., 1998b]. Since around 60 wt.% of discharged bottom bed waste \n\nis composed by sand particles having sizes in the range of 0.5 \u2013 1.0 mm, the mentioned \n\nincrease of discharge frequency will imply a stronger make-up with fresh sand, while \n\nincreases the volume of waste being generated. \n\n The bottom bed waste from BFBC have the code 100124 according to European \n\nList of Wastes [Decree n.\u00ba 209/2004] and the search for recycling or reuse alternatives of \n\nsuch residue is an hot topic and a serious need. We should also look to other relevant \n\nenvironmental indications like the one given by Hoffman (2013) that concluded that \n\naround 90% of the beaches in the world are losing ground due to excessive sand extraction \n\nfor distinct uses. \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n141 \n \n\n Previous studies demonstrated that the use of bottom bed waste from biomass \n\nburning in BFBC as substitute of the conventional sand used as coarse aggregate in the \n\nformulation of industrially-prepared rendering-mortars is technologically feasible [Modolo \n\net al., 2013]; in general this substitution does not induce negative effects on the relevant \n\nproperties and material accomplishes with required specifications. However, other \n\napplications for such waste must be found and one obvious option is the recirculation or \n\nreuse of the material in the same BFBC. Apparently easy, this way requires the pre-\n\nadjustment of particle size distribution, with removal of fines and agglomerates by \n\nscreening. This pre-treatment might also help to minimize the concentration of inorganic \n\nalkali elements that tend to constitute the agglomerates. Nevertheless, other chemical \n\nimpurities might not be removed by this simple process, and additional leaching/washing \n\nprocesses might be required to reach the purity level of the bed make-up. \n\n The main aim of the actual work is improving the knowledge on the characteristics \n\nof bottom bed waste from fluidized bed combustion of residual forest biomass in \n\nPortuguese thermal plants and cogeneration plants. Based on them, physical pre-treatment \n\nprocesses were applied aiming to regenerate the material to be recirculated in the bed of a \n\npilot-scale combustor. \n\n8.2  Materials and methods \n\n8.2.1 Characterization of industrial bottom bed waste \n\n The sampling schematic diagram of the ashes here studied is shown in Figure 8.1. \n\nThe bottom bed waste (BBW) studied were sampled in two BFBC, with nominal capacities \n\nof 50 MWh and 100 MWth, denominated TPP_1 and TPP_2 respectively. They both use a \n\nmixture of forest biomass residues as fuel. In each installation, the typical operating \n\ntemperature of the bubbling bed ranges from 750\u00baC to 940\u00baC; while the O2 concentration in \n\nthe flue gas varies between 4 vol.% and 8 vol.% (dry gases). Bottom bed wastes from \n\nTPP_1 (BBW_1) and from TPP_2 (BBW_2) were collected and characterized \n\nsimultaneously during one year (monthly).The particle size distributions of the fresh bed \n\nsand (FBS) and of bottom bed wastes were obtained by sieving, following the NP EN 933-\n\n1:2000 standard. For this determination, the waste was collected from the BFBC and used \n\nas discharged. Further characterization tests were performed with sieved fraction below 2 \n\nmm. The chemical composition was obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n142 \n \n\nusing a Panalytical Axios spectrometer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the wastes \n\nwere taken using an X-ray diffractometer (RIGAKU-Geigerflex, power 40kV/30mA) and \n\nthe semi-quantitative analysis determined by MDI Jade9 software using WPF (Whole \n\nPattern Fitting) method, in the scan mode continuous/speed-3 2??/min. Simultaneous \n\ngravimetric and differential thermal analyses (TG/DTA \u2013 Setaram, Labsys) were used to \n\ncomplement the chemical characterization, namely to detect unburnt organic components. \n\n \nFigure 8. 1. Schematic diagram of the main ashes flows in a thermal plant with BFBC and the \n\nrespective samples used in this study. \n\n8.2.2 Use of recycled bed waste (RBW) as sand bed replacement in BFBC \n\n From a third TPP with nominal capacity of 90MWth, which operates in similar \n\nconditions of TPP_1 and TPP_2, in terms of temperature and pressure, but using \n\neucalyptus bark as major fuel, another BBW sample (~50kg) was collected and sieved, \n\nhaving particles ranging from 0.3 mm and 1.0 mm. This sample is here named recycled bed \n\nwaste (RBW) since it was reused as fluidized bed in a pilot-scale combustor. The \n\ncombustion experiments were performed in a pilot-scale bubbling fluidized bed (0.2 m \n\nheight); the reactor is a thermally insulated AISI 310 SS tube with 0.25 m internal diameter \n\nand 3 m height. The facility layout is shown in Figure 2 and is better described elsewhere \n\n \n\n \n\nSecondary air  \n\nBiomass   \nFresh sand  \n\nCoarse (dp > 1.0 mm) bottom bed  \n(to treatment, material valorization, or disposal ) \n\nFine (dp &lt;0.3 mm) bottom bed ash   \n(to treatment, material valorization, or disposal)  \n\nBottom bed ash sieving  \n\nFly ash  \n\nFly ash  \n(to treatment, material valorization or disposal ) \n\nPrimary  air \n\nBottom bed ash   \n\nBottom bed with intermediate particle  \nsize (0.3 mm &lt;dp &lt;1.0 mm)  \n\nMaterial valorization in  \nconstruction materials  \n\nAdditional treatment  \n\nFresh bed sand (FBS)\n\nBottom bed waste \n(BBW)\n\nRecycled bed \nwaste  (RBW)\n\nIndustrial Power Plant\n\nRecycled bottom bed \nash recycled (RBBW)\n\nPilot-scale\n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n143 \n \n\n[Tarelho et al., 2011; Tarelho et al., 2004; Tarelho et al., 2005). The combustion air is \n\nstaged with primary air during the distributor plate whereas secondary air goes into a \n\nvertical tube located inside the freeboard. The solid fuel is fed together the secondary air \n\nand discharged constantly at the bed surface (Figure 8.2). Eight water-cooled probes are \n\nlocated at the bed level. They allow the bed temperature control between the desired \n\nranges. Pressure and temperature along the reactor are supervised by means of nine water-\n\ncooled sampling probes located at several heights; two are immersed in the dense bed and \n\nthe others are situated along the freeboard. Each probe is equipped with a cooled particle \n\nfilter at the stern of the probe, a K-type thermocouple, and a cerablanket (ceramic fiber \n\nrefractory) cap at the tip located inside the combustion chamber with the purpose of \n\nholding the particles present in the flue gas. The combustion flue gas composition was \n\nmonitored continuously at the exit of the combustion chamber in terms of O2, CO and CO2; \n\nthe online gas analyzers included a paramagnetic sensor for O2 (ADC model 02-700 with a \n\nServomex Module) and non-dispersive infra-red sensors for CO2 and CO (ADC model SB-\n\n300). Residual forest biomass from eucalyptus logging activities was used as fuel; it was \n\nair dried, chopped and sieved to the size range of 1-5 mm. The main thermochemical \n\ncharacteristics of the biomass used as fuel are shown in Table 8.1. The pilot-scale BFBC \n\noperated with a bed temperature in the range of 790-840 \u00baC, and with an excess air of 50%. \n\nThe fuel was continuously fed to the reactor at a rate of approximately 3.8 kg/h. The \n\ncombustion air was staged, with primary air accounting for 80% of the total combustion \n\nair. The combustion experiments lasted approximately 10 hours. After that, the bottom bed \n\nash was discharged/quenched and conditioned for further characterization. \n\nTable 8. 1.

Samples of forest biomass residues used as fuel \n\nin the industrial thermal power plants were collected in the fuel feeding system of the \n\nplants in order to characterize the impurities (forest soil and stones) fed mixed. Those \n\nimpurities were separated from branches, grounded in agate mill (<0.100 mm) and \n\ncharacterized in terms of chemical composition and mineralogy. \n\n8.3 Results and Discussion  \n\n8.3.1 Industrial bottom bed waste \n\n Figure 8.3 illustrates the macroscopic view of the fresh bed sand particles \u201ca\u201d, and \n\nparticles of the two wastes (BBW_1 \u201cb\u201d and BBW_2 \u201cc\u201d). Color differences are very \n\nnotorious between the two wastes, reflecting the type of biomass used as fuel (TPP_1 burns \n\na large variety of residual forest biomass residues, whereas TPP_2 uses mainly eucalyptus \n\nbark), and the presence of unburnt material (that tend to assume dark hue). In both \n\nresidues, the presence of coarse particles is evident, reflecting the presence of inorganic \n\nimpurities (forest soil particles, coarse and small stones) fed mixed with the biomass fuel. \n\nThe macroscopic view of these impurities is shown in Figure 8.4 \u201ca\u201d and their \n\nmineralogical and chemical composition in Figure 8.4 \u201cb\u201d and \u201cc\u201d respectively. The \n\npresence of this type of impurities fed mixed in biomass evidences bad practices applied \n\nduring biomass handling at forest before delivering to the BFBC installations. In terms of \n\nmineralogy, quartz and kaolinite are the most abundant crystalline phases present in this \n\nmaterial, followed by common mica (muscovite) and feldspars (microcline and albite). \n\nConsequently, Si, Al and K are the most abundant chemical elements present in these \n\nimpurities, as detected in the chemical analysis (Figure 8.4 \u201cc\u201d). \n\n Figures 8.5 and 3.6 show the particle size distributions of FBS and BBW. The \n\nwastes have wide particle size distributions when compared to the FSB, being the presence \n\nof fines (particles under 0.25 mm) relatively more abundant than the amount of coarse \n\ngrains (> 1 mm). This is an indication that agglomeration is not too severe in the actual \n\nburning conditions, being the fines introduced as impurities in the fuel feed or resulting \n\nfrom the breakdown of larger particles of the sand bed. Dimensional changes between \n\nsamples collected in consecutive months are broader in BBW_2, reflecting less stable \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n146 \n \n\noperating conditions in the TPP_2. Nevertheless, the fraction of particles within the \n\ndesirable size range (0.3-1 mm) is rather similar in the two wastes, representing around 60 \n\nwt.% of the material. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 8. 3.

Particle size distribution of BBW samples from thermal power plant 2. \n\nFigure 8.7 and Figure 8.8 show the chemical compositions of the wastes and FSB, \n\nwhile their semi-quantitative mineralogical constitution is given in Figure 8.9. In general, \n\nchanges on the composition of BBW collected in consecutive months are not expressive, \n\napart some punctual fluctuations in minor elements (e.g. Cl, S, Ti). Anyway, BBW_1 \n\nseems to show higher variability, certainly related with stronger changes is the fuel feed, as \n\npreviously mentioned. Both BBW samples show Si as major element (between 35 and 40 \n\n%wt.), being mostly present as quartz. FBS is even richer in Si, because is mainly \n\ncomposed by quartz sand, as can be seen in Figure 8.10 and also as will be showed by \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n0.01 0.10 1.00 10.00 100.00\n\nC\nu\n\nm\nu\n\nla\nti\n\nv\ne \n\np\nas\n\nse\nd\n\n (%\n)\n\nmm\n\nFBS\nBBW_1_01\nBBW_1_02\nBBW_1_03\nBBW_1_04\nBBW_1_05\nBBW_1_06\nBBW_1_07\nBBW_1_08\nBBW_1_09\nBBW_1_10\nBBW_1_11\nBBW_1_12\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n0.01 0.10 1.00 10.00 100.00\n\nC\nu\n\nm\nu\n\nla\nti\n\nv\ne \n\np\nas\n\nse\nd\n\n (%\n)\n\nmm\n\nFBS\nBBW_2_01\nBBW_2_02\nBBW_2_03\nBBW_2_04\nBBW_2_05\nBBW_2_06\nBBW_2_07\nBBW_2_08\nBBW_2_09\nBBW_2_10\nBBW_2_11\nBBW_2_12\n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n148 \n \n\nSEM-EDX analyses. Contributing to the high Si content in the BBW samples is the \n\noriginal fresh bed sand, and also the forest soil particles fed mixed with the residual forest \n\nbiomass resulting from bad practices during biomass harvesting and handling previously to \n\ncombustion in the industrial BFBC installations, as also referred in other studies [Steenari \n\net al., 1999]; the impurities (forest soil particles) fed mixed with the residual forest biomass \n\nalso contribute to the Al and K content (present in the microcline and albite mineral \n\ncomposition). Calcium (and magnesium) tend to react with Si or to generate carbonates, \n\nwhile these last components might also be present since the beginning as contaminant of \n\nthe sand or in the biomass. Those additional elements/phases detected in the wastes were \n\ncertainly introduced by the inorganic impurities present in the biomass (Figure 8.4), as \n\nreported in the literature [\u00c5mand and Leckner, 2004; Aho et al., 2008; Dayton et al., 1999]. \n\nWhile few and small, mullite peaks seem also to be present, certainly as a result of \n\nreactions that occurred at high temperature. Loss on ignition is below 2% in all BBW \n\nsamples, but changes along the time are relatively high, particularly for BBW_2. This is \n\nanother indication of higher operational fluctuations on the TPP_2 unit. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 8. 7.

The most noticeable weight loss was registered between \n\n600 and 800 \u00baC and results from the release of CO2 of the carbonates (mainly calcite).

This enrichment occurs as a coating layer of the sand \n\nparticles. This process is shown in Figure 8.12 and Figure 8.13, where the SEM-EDS of the \n\ncross-section of a particle from the fresh sand bed (FSB) and a particle from the RBW are \n\npresented. In these figures, we also show the distribution and qualitative abundance of \n\nsome of those chemical elements, namely Ca, K, Mg, Al, P, and Na. The increasing of such \n\nelements in the outer layer of the bottom bed particles has been documented in the \n\nliterature and appears to establish the particle agglomeration [Zevenhoven-Onderwater et \n\nal., 2006; Nuutinen et al., 2004; Ohman and Nordin, 2000; Lin et al., 2003; Lin and Wey, \n\n2004; Scala and Chirone, 2006].

Nordin, 2000; Lyn and Wey, 2004; Kuo et al., 2008; Lin \n\net al., 2009; Skrifvars et al., 1998; Zevenhoven-Onderwater et al., 2001]. Attempting to \n\nprevent its occurrence, some authors suggested the use of certain additives [Bartels et al., \n\n2008; Ohman and Nordin, 2000; Kuo et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2009; Llorente et al., 2006]. \n\nAccording to Lin et al. (2009) the coating layer formed around the particles is composed by \n\ninfusible fine waste particles embedded in the melted phases. These authors concluded that \n\nmelts contain potassium, sodium, and sulfur, while the infusible components are rich in \n\ncalcium and magnesium. Based on SEM-EDS determinations, distinct authors [Nuutinen et \n\nal., 2004; Ohman et al., 2000] demonstrate that the coating layer of sand particles is rich in \n\nalkali and Si. The melting point of certain silicates can be as low as 720\u00baC, being the \n\nreaction also affected by the particle size. Tendency for agglomeration is proportional to \n\nthe specific surface area of the particles [Langston and Stephens, 1960], so the relative \n\namount of finer grains should be limited. Combustion experiments conducted with RBW \n\nlasted for 6-7 hours (constant period of data registration).  \n\n \nFigure 8. 12.

The temperature has a minimum value (around 380\u00baC) at the base of the bed \n\n(measured below the level of the fluidizing air injectors, that is, in the fixed bed region), \n\nthen it increases in the fluidized bed section and achieves its maximum (960\u00baC) just above \n\nthe place where fuel feeding and secondary air ingress occurs.  \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n152 \n \n\n \nFigure 8. 13.

After that, the temperature \n\ndecreases along the freeboard due to heat losses through furnace walls (Figure 8.2). \n\n The operating temperature is an important parameter to be controlled in order to \n\nguarantee an efficient fuel conversion, and also to control the bed fluidization conditions. \n\nFigure 8.15 shows typical flue gas composition profile measured during the experiment; \n\nCO2, O2, and CO average concentrations (by %vol. of dry gases) were around 13%, 8% \n\nand 0.005%, respectively. \n\n During the pilot-scale combustion experiment no expressive particle agglomeration \n\nwas observed, and so no changes on the bed fluidizing conditions were registered. The \n\nwaste discharged from the pilot-scale BFBC, thereafter denoted as recycled bottom bed \n\nwaste (RBBW), looked just slightly darker than the used RBW.  \n\n Nevertheless it was observed the occurrence of some sand particles linked, \n\ncorresponding to less than 0.1% of bed mass [value founded through the sieving (retained \n\nmass in 1.00 mm) of bottom bed waste total mass]. Industrially, this 0.1% can represent \n\naround 50kg of agglomerates total mass, considering a bed capacity of 50 tones. \n\n \nFigure 8.  15.

It is observed that some particles are linked by a kind of \n\nconnective bridge with distinct texture when compared to the surrounding particles. \n\nAccording to many developed studies already referred, this phenomenon is related with the \n\noccurrence of melting in the outer layer of the sand particles, and associated with the \n\nrelative content of some chemical elements (mainly sodium, potassium) present in this ash \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n155 \n \n\nlayer [Bartels et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2009; Langston and Stephens, 1960; \n\nManzoori and Agarwal, 1994]. \n\nFigure 8.16 \u201cb\u201d shows a detail (determined by SEM-EDS analysis) of a particle \n\nsurface and connection layer between particles from 8.16 \u201ca\u201d. From Figure 8.16 \u201cb\u201d it is \n\nobserved that the main elements present in the particle surface (measured at 2.4 and 8.7 \u00b5 m \n\ndepths) are Ca, Si, Mg, Al, P, Cl, Mn and Fe. The EDS from the particle surface at 2.4 \u00b5 m \n\ndepth indicate mainly the presence of Ca, Si and Mg. With increasing depth in the particle \n\nsurface, e.g. at 8.7 \u00b5 m (also in the typical outer ash layer of the bed particles (Figure 8.12), \n\nit is observed an increasing intensity in the abundance of Mg and K. In fact, it is reported in \n\nthe literature, a characteristic dual ash layer around the bed particles that consists of an \n\ninner layer rich in potassium (typically potassium silicate) and an outer layer rich in \n\ncalcium where calcium silicate is dominant [Ohman et al., 2005; Elled et al., 2013; \n\nNuutinen et al., 2004]. In this case, calcium is dominant in both depths. \n\n8.3.3 Economic evaluation of the recirculation scenario \n\n Figure 8.16 \u201cc\u201d shows the detail (determined by SEM/EDS analysis) of the \n\nconnection bridge formed between two adjacent sand particles. It is confirmed the \n\nenrichment in sodium, potassium and silicon, and the relative decrease in calcium, in the \n\nbridge connecting the two bed particles when compared with the particle surface EDS \n\n(Figure 8.16 \u201cb\u201d). This chemical composition explains the lowering on the melting \n\ntemperature of the ash layer around the sand particles and the consequent connection \n\nbridge formation between adjacent particles, as has been reported in the literature [Lin et \n\nal., 2003; Zevenhoven-Onderwater et al., 2001]. The interaction between alkali metals and \n\noxygen can result in the formation of oxide-eutectics with a low melting point, for example \n\nNa2O, causing particle agglomeration [Lin et al., 2009; Atak\u00fcl et al., 2005]. Also, the \n\nimportance of potassium in this process is recognized, e.g., Elled et al. (2013) found \n\npotassium silicate (K2SiO9) in the inner ash layer and using a thermodynamic equilibrium \n\nmodeling approach suggested that it can originate a melt at typical temperatures of \n\nfluidized bed combustion. They suggest that this melted form of K2SiO9, which can also be \n\npresent as K2O.4SiO2 probably leads to a sticky coating of the quartz sand particles which \n\ninduce agglomeration if this inner ash layer is not covered by non-sticky as particles \n\nconsisting of calcium silicate. \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n156 \n \n\n Nevertheless, it should probably be noted that these problems of agglomeration \n\nmay become minimized considering, in addition to the physical treatment, a chemical \n\ntreatment of recycled bottom bed waste through an efficient washing system in order to \n\ndecrease part of the alkali and soluble salts concentration [Tarelho et al., 2012; Modolo et \n\nal., 2013], thus decreasing the risk of bed particles agglomeration. However, in that \n\ncircumstance it will be needed to consider proper management options for the washing \n\nsolution. \n\n Table 8.3 presents real inputs and outputs of biomass fuel, fresh sand bed, bottom \n\nbed waste and fly ash mass flows for the two thermal power plants (TPP_1 and TPP_2). In \n\ngeneral, inputs are similar for the two power plants, but significant differences exist in the \n\nrelative amount of produced bottom bed waste and fly ash; TPP_1 generates higher amount \n\nof BBW (~ 6900 ton) when compared to TPP_2 (5819 ton). \n\n Estimated values were also obtained (see Table 8.3), based on experimental data \n\ncollected in field, and on bench and pilot-scale trials. In this analysis, we approached the \n\ndecreasing of mass flow sent to landfill while saving costs associated with partial \n\nreplacement of fresh sand for bed make-up were anticipated (Table 8.2). The fresh sand \n\nused in these BFBCs has particle sizes comprehended in the range of 0.3-1.0 mm. As it has \n\nbeen shown, BBW contains ~60% particles within that size range. \n\nTable 8. 2. Thermal power plants mass flows of biomass fuel, FBS, BBW and FA quantities and \nassociated costs. \n\n \n\nIf no material valorization is considered, a total of 12719 ton of BBW is landfilled, \n\nwith an associated cost of around 400.000,00 \u20ac/year [the landfill cost is estimated and \n\nEstimated data TPP_1 TPP_2 Unit\nInerts  fed with biomas s (dry base)** 31.7 29.0 t/day\nBiomass ash content (Los s on 550\u00baC - dry base) 10.8 14.0 t/day\nMass of fresh bed sand input (dry base)* 2.6 4.4 t/day\nTotal 45.1 47.3 t/day\n\nReal data supplied by the industry TPP_1 TPP_2\nBBW - Discharge (dry base)* 20.9 17.6 t/day\nFA - Discharge (dry bas e)* 20.5 29.8 t/day\nFA - Discharge (dry bas e)** 24.2 29.7 t/day\nTotal* 41.4 47.4 t/day\nTotal** 45.1 47.3 t/day\n\n*Indust ry dat a\n\n**Est imat ed values based on bench test s and Industry values\n\nInput\n\nOutput (a)\n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n157 \n \n\nvariable based on industry data; the values are calculated in \u20ac/waste ton/km].

This estimation does not consider potential costs \n\nassociated with physical BBW treatment operations, since in the actual circumstances the \n\nscreening facilities already exist in the industrial unit and then no additional investment \n\ncosts are required for its acquisition. \n\nTable 8. 3.

The \n\namount of wastes generated is referred to a ton of processed pulp. Table 9.1 presents the \n\namount of some solid wastes generated in the pulp mill during 2012 year based on 330 \n\nworking days in Portugal. Fly ash from biomass combustion was not studied in this thesis \n\nwork, but its generated amount is also presented. \n\nTable 9. 1.

This estimative and respective recycling capacity is presented in Figure \n\n9.1 and discussed in the section 9.2. \n\n Considering the developed study-cases in this thesis, it was possible to summarize \n\nthe solutions discussed in section 9.2 for the waste material valorization. \n\n9.2  Material valorization solutions \n\n9.2.1  Fiber-cement (Chapter 3) \n\n Virgin long fiber pulp (VLFP) represents 2.6% of total fiber-cement composition in \n\nproportion of dry raw materials. Conventionally the used fiber in fiber-cement production \n\nis from softwood (Pinus). In this work, these softwood long fibers were replaced by \n\nhardwood fibers existing in the primary sludge (PS) that is generated in pulp and paper mill \n\neffluent treatment; the fixed replacement level studied was 25%. The primary sludge \n\ncomposition includes around ~70% hardwood fibers and fillers (~5% sand and 25% \n\nprecipitated calcium carbonate), as already referred on chapter 3. Figure 9.1 presents the \n\nabsorption/consuming flow of the fiber-cement application. \n\nIt is important to consider the following aspects related not only with the waste \n\ncharacteristics but also with the process itself: \n\n\u2022 Sludge transportation and storage \n\nThe specific characteristics of PS, namely its high moisture content and odour, lead to \n\nspecial care in terms of transportation and storage. First, PS needs to be transported in big \n\nbags which will facilitate its weight measurement before being introduced into refinement \n\ntank for beating. After, these big bags can easily be storage in a place where they don\u2019t \n\ndisturb workers due to its unpleasant smell. It is also important to consider the storage time \n\nwhich will depend on the weather and storage conditions, trying to avoid PS decomposition \n\nand consequent loss of quality. \n\n\u2022 Energy - Sludge disintegration (beating process) \n\nThe Eucalyptus fibers achieve the same Schopper Riegler degree consuming less energy \n\ncomparing to Pinus fibers. Lower refinement time represents low energy consumption \n\ncompared to the standard process containing only virgin pulp composed of long fibers. A \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \n\n163 \n \n\n30% time saving was estimated during the industrial test procedure, consequently, leading \n\nto costs reduction. \n\n\u2022 Water quality control (total suspended solids and dissolved salts) \n\nThe VLFP represents 2.6% of dry material in fiber-cement production. 25% of this amount \n\ncan be substituted by primary sludge. Knowing that 40% of primary sludge is composed by \n\ninorganic material, the amount of suspended solids introduced by the sludge is estimated in \n\n26 kg per ton of dried fiber-cement produced. This solids might be retained on fiber-\n\ncement sheets or drained to the process water together conventional solids. This fact can \n\nlead to two opposite aspects, a positive and a negative one. The positive aspect is related to \n\nthe fiber-cement sheet density increase that was evaluated as appropriated in the final \n\nproduct specification. The negative one is related with the cumulative discharge of solid \n\nmatter presented in the waste composition, in the water process. This fact might deserve \n\nmore frequent monitorization of the water in order to avoid problems as vats obstruction \n\nand/or corrosion of equipment and consequently improvement of maintenance costs. \n\nGeneral costs associated with this waste management solution were shown on Chapter 3. \n\n9.2.2  Bituminous mixtures (Chapter 4) \n\n The amount of aggregates in a bituminous mixture represents between 90 to 95% in \n\nmass and 70 to 75% in volume [Pereira e Santos, 2002]. It was estimated that the amount \n\nof crushed limestone and filler (represents around 50%wt of 4%wt total aggregates, \n\nrespectively) consumed per one kilometre of dense bituminous layer - with 6 cm of \n\nthickness (DBL) from a highway with 27 meters width. Assuming those figures, the \n\namount of grits and dregs used as replacement of the primary components can be \n\nestimated. The substitution of 5%wt of crushed limestone by grits represents to save 10% \n\nof that conventional material extracted. The construction of at least 200 kilometres of DBL \n\nis necessary to incorporate all grits generated per year. In case of dregs, replacing 1% of \n\nthe filler represents to avoid more than 25% of this conventional material extraction. \n\n However, not only the saving of non-renewable materials extraction makes part of \n\nthis recycling option and other aspects must be considered and researched in order to \n\nimprove this solution, including both environment and industrial issues.  \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \n\n164 \n \n\n For instance, two wastes characteristics, moisture and soluble salts content are \n\nexamples of these aspects to be assessed. The need for drying is one of the most relevant \n\nissues, due to energy demand and cost. Dregs and grits have high moisture content (~50% \n\nand 40%, respectively) requiring proper pre-drying before composing the bituminous \n\nmixture. Additionally, dregs require a washing treatment to reduce the level of soluble \n\nsalts. According to experimental indications given in chapter 5, a minimum of 10 tons of \n\nhot water (~80\u00baC) per ton of dregs is required to reach an acceptable level of soluble salts \n\nin their composition, allowing then their use in bituminous mixtures. In addition, the \n\nwastewater from the washing process should be properly treated before discharge in the \n\nenvironment, and this enhances costs. \n\n9.2.3  Industrial Mortars (Chapters 6 and 7) \n\nTwo types of industrial mortars were analyzed in this work, namely renders and \n\ncementitious-adhesive formulations. In both products, the used of conventional calibrated \n\nsand was replaced by treated bottom ash generated in a bubbling fluidized bed combustor \n\nusing forest residues as fuel. In general, these applications seemed to be technologically \n\nfeasible. The substitution did not induce negative impact on the relevant properties and \n\nformulations accomplish with the industry required specifications. However, the waste \n\ntreatment (sieving to remove coarse and fine particles and/or washing to diminish soluble \n\nsalts content) before utilization seems to be needed in order to guarantee the success of this \n\nsolution. \n\nFigure 9.2 presents the estimation of the amounts of bottom ash with interest for this \n\nspecific application in terms of conventional sand replacement, bottom ash generated \n\namount and bottom ash surplus; it is also shown the amount of conventional sand \n\nconsumed. According to the results presented and discussed in detail on chapters 6 and 7 it \n\nis possible to replace over 50%wt of conventional calibrated sand by a fraction of bottom \n\nash without compromising the final products quality. In order to improve this waste \n\nmanagement solution, it is important to consider aspects related with the waste \n\ncharacteristics and to the process itself. \n\n According to industry data (value supplied by one factory) at least 24000 tonnes of \n\ncalibrated sand has been consumed every year. They are generated around 28750 tonnes of \n\nraw bottom ash per year in which 60% (~17250t) is useful for being utilized as aggregate \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \n\n165 \n \n\nin these types of mortars. For example, if consider 25% (value tested in bench scale) of \n\nconventional calibrated sand replacement by treated (just sieved) bottom ash, it has been \n\nverified that at least 6000 tonnes of this waste (fractions between 0.3 \u2013 1.00 mm) would be \n\nvalorized (Figure 9.2). The treated bottom ash surplus (~11250t) could be used in other \n\napplications i.e. its reuse in as raw material as substitute of fresh sand for bottom bed make \n\nup in fluidized bed combustors where it is generated (see Chapter 8). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 9. 2. Estimated amount of total bottom ash generated, bottom ash fraction with interest for industrial \n\nmortars, conventional sand consumption and bottom ash surplus. \n  \n\n9.3 Concluding remarks \n\nThe involved partners will have to be aware about the advantages and concerns \n\nrelated with the above referred processes of waste valorization. In case of the waste \n\nproducer, by avoiding landfilling it contributes to environment protection; and also \n\neconomic costs related with to this waste management option are saved. Part of the savings \n\nrelated to the avoiding of waste landfilling can be used by the waste producer to transport \n\nand deliver the waste to the unit where its pre-treatment will be performed. In case of the \n\nunit that treats the waste to sell or to valorize it, if he receives the waste on its location, the \n\neconomic benefits are higher considering that he gets an additional product to be treated \n\nand commercialized without raw material acquisition. However, the need for investment \n\nwill depend on the industrial unit where the waste will be treated, as for, place to storage \n\nthe waste, the need for specific sieving, liquid effluent treatment and monitoring and this \n\nwill influence the costs of the recycling operation. At least, the benefit in terms of \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \n\n166 \n \n\ndecreased costs related to conventional sand acquisition will avoid the extraction of the \n\nnatural resource thus contributing to environmental protection, and sustainability of \n\nprocess.  \n\nThe success of those recycling solutions will depend on how the intervenient have \n\ncapacity to integrate the operations and to minimize the related costs with the whole \n\nprocess.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n10 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS\n\n\n\nChapter 10 \n\n168 \n \n\n10.1 Conclusions \n\nThe design of correct waste management plans could avoid the landfilling of \n\nseveral by-products/wastes and, if recycling alternatives are searched, the consumption of \n\nprimary non-renewable resources will diminish. Impacts associated to their extraction and \n\ntreatment will be avoided. However, to fully accomplish with environmental and technical \n\naspects of each recycling solution, multidisciplinary issues must be considered. \n\nNovel recycling alternatives for several wastes generated by the pulp and paper \n\nindustries were defined in this work, as is summarized in this chapter. \n\n \n\n Fiber-cement composites can be produced with 25% of primary sludge in \n\nsubstitution of conventional cellulose long fibers without affecting the required properties \n\nof the material or the productive process. The controlled parameters of the processing \n\nwater, such as COD, chlorides, sulphates, dissolved salts and metals of process water are \n\nacceptable when compared with the conventional process. The mechanical and physical \n\nproperties of the sludge-containing composites were improved. Fiber-cement sheets with \n\nprimary sludge achieved a bending moment higher than conventional ones (5267 N and \n\n4695 N, respectively) and a load at rupture was also higher and acceptable according to the \n\nfinal product quality control. \n\n \n\n Grits could easily be used as aggregates in dense bituminous mixtures for \n\nregularization layers of road pavements. Physical and mechanical properties that define the \n\nstability of the material are suitable. This waste is compatible with natural crushed stone \n\nnormally used as aggregate for similar applications. By contrast, the use of dregs in the \n\nsame application requires pre-treatment operations, namely washing to remove soluble \n\nsalts, and then further studies are required to prescribe a better way to treat/adapt this waste \n\n(cost effective). The soluble salts influence is clearly demonstrated when mixes MBDC1%, \n\nMBG5% and MBG10% presented a good behaviour in terms of conserved strength (up to \n\n75%), but formulations   with more than 2%wt of dregs (MBDC2%, MBDC3% and \n\nMBDC4%) presented water sensitivity. After dregs washing, the tests showed that it is \n\npossible to obtain a very good performance of formulations with until 4%wt of filler \n\nreplacing by dregs in terms of conserved strength, even with voids content lower than the \n\nallowed value. This problem could be easily solved by a particle size adjustment of the \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \n\n169 \n \n\naggregate. The problem with water sensitivity had been solved with the washing \n\nprocedure. \n\n \n\n Precipitated calcium carbonate (CaCO3) mud is an avoidable by-product when the \n\nindustrial unit is working properly, since it might be reused and fully consumed in the lime \n\nkiln to regenerate the causticizing agent for the regeneration of digestion liquor. If \n\navailable, as occurred during this work, its properties are compatible with those of \n\nprimary/natural calcium carbonate and it might be used in cement-based products, like \n\nmortars. The ones prepared and characterized is this thesis show technological properties \n\nthat fulfill the standard requirements. Specifically in terms of bulk, the filler effect is \n\nobvious, whereby mortar densifies up to an optimum value situated between 10 and 20% \n\nof LM amount. LM formulations presented compressive strength values between 22 and 23 \n\nMPa at 90 days of curing while reference presented similar results. In general, their \n\ncharacteristics are similar to the ones of current industrial formulations and preparation \n\nconditions are also not much affected. The high moisture content of the mud is the main \n\ndrawback, in terms of transportation for a potential mortar producer. Viable ways to \n\nminimize it should be search. \n\n \n\nThe bottom ash generated in bubbling fluidized bed combustors used to burn the \n\nbiomass wastes was here studied in two distinct directions: (i) recycling in rendering or \n\nadhesive mortar formulations, as sand substitute (used as aggregate); (ii) reuse in \n\nregenerated beds for further combustion steps. \n\nFor using in mortar formulations the as-collected ash shows suitable particle size \n\ndistribution but the high chlorides content deserve control and the potential use of cleaning \n\ntreatment. The simple washing process tested in industrial-scale trials revealed to be \n\neffective in reducing the amount (by about 60%) of soluble chlorides in the ash. Once \n\ntreated (sieved), the increasing amount of bottom ash as sand substitute for both products, \n\nrendering-mortars and cementitious-adhesive mortars. In case of rendering-mortars, been \n\nash particles relatively smaller than conventional sand replaced, the thicker mixes had as \n\nconsequence, the flowability of ash-containing mixes decreased. Anyway differences were \n\nminor and can easily adjustable if required.  \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \n\n170 \n \n\nThe tensile adhesion strength at 28 days of curing in standard conditions incresed at \n\nabout 23% (sample with 100% of substitution) when compared with reference (sample \n\nwithout BA). A considerable increase of wetting capability and transference values was \n\nobserved, probably associated with the homogeneous particle size distribution of BA and \n\nwith the roughness of its surface. These BA characteristics might explain this increase. \n\nIndeed, less finer particles demanding less water retard skin formation, leading to better \n\ntransference capability.  \n\n \n\n Considering the relevance of the bottom ash characteristics on its application in the \n\nrecycling processes studied here, the monitoring of bottom ash characteristics in a biomass \n\nthermal power plant confirms that significant variations can occur along the year, namelly \n\nin terms of chemical elements composition. The chemical element present in higher \n\nconcentration (oxygen is not considered) in the bottom ashes is Si. The amount of Si, \n\nexpressed as SiO2, varied from 79 wt% to 91wt%. The high concentration of Si is related \n\nwith the natural (mostly quartz) sand (>98.5wt% SiO2) used as original bottom bed in the \n\nBFBC. Considering the relatively high content of inert material (forest soil particles and \n\nsmall stones) fed mixed with the biomass, it is expected also that the bottom ash \n\ncomposition is influenced by the composition of that inert material. The bottom bed ashes \n\nare also enriched in chemical elements that can be found in the inorganic fraction of \n\nbiomass, when compared to the original sand bed. That enrichment is noticed also as a \n\ncoating layer around the sand particles of the bed. It was observed that the coating layer \n\naround the sand particles was not completely removed by water leaching, although a \n\ndecrease on the coating layer thickness occurred after industrial treatment (for example, by \n\nleaching) of bottom ash particles. The presence of Na and Ca in the coating layer is \n\nresponsible for the formation of a glassy phase that promotes the agglomeration even at \n\nrelatively low bed operation temperature (around 870\u00baC). Attempting to reuse a fraction of \n\nthe discharged bottom bed sand from the fluidized bed combustor for bed make-up, the \n\ncontent of fluxing elements such as Ca, Na and K must be carefully controlled, in order to \n\navoid potential agglomeration. \n\n  \n\n Regarding the environmental aspects related with the industrial solid wastes \n\nvalorization, this work contributes with results about several possibilities of recycling these \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \n\n171 \n \n\nwastes as substitute of some raw natural minerals in industrial applications. The wastes \n\nintensive characterization contributes to industry and research giving important \n\ninformation about potential raw materials, the tested applications and results obtained from \n\nproduced and tested formulations demonstrated that it seems to be possible to obtain final \n\nproducts with similar characteristics of conventional products. These solutions could avoid \n\na significant decrease on wastes landfilling and consequently its recycling could contribute \n\nto decrease the extraction of non-renewable resources as it is the case of some minerals.   \n\n  \n\n10.2 Future works \n\n As proposals for future works it would be interesting to design integrated treatment \n\nstations in the paper and pulp industries, attempting to optimize washing, sieving and \n\ndrying operations eventually required to adapt certain wastes for future valorization. This \n\nsolution is a step forward in comparison to the existing waste treatment facilities that \n\nbasically involve the wastewater treatment before safety discharge. Moreover, such \n\nindustrial units normally have heat and power available for the requirements of some of the \n\nnovel operation. This concept of circular processes will contribute to fastly achieve \n\nsustainable indicators that are associated to near zero-waste production. As examples, the \n\nwashing of dregs and bottom ash might be, at least partially, conducted by the treated \n\nwater that is now discharged. Drying of dregs and primary sludge should use the wasted \n\nheat generated by biomass burning. \n\n  \n\nAll the applications suggested for wastes recycling still deserve assessment of \n\ndurability issues, due to the punctual character and temporal limitations of runned tests. In \n\nparticular, formation of efflorescence and other chemical-related pathology should be \n\ncarefully checked. \n\n  \n\nDevelopment of a systematic assessment of the environmental consequences \n\nassociated with the tested wastes. This study should involve the quantification and analysis \n\nof environmental balances (gains and losses) associated with them. Through this evaluation \n\nit is important to quantify the most relevant environmental discharges involved in all stages \n\nof life cycle of this ash, from origin, transport, use, and disposal. It would be assessed \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \n\n172 \n \n\nvaluation of the waste solutions for comparative analysis with the current destination. To \n\nachieve the above would be essential to select the tool to perform the LCA (Life Cycle \n\nAnalysis), and analysis of the benefits and limitations of the chosen methodology. \n\nAn economic analysis about the waste management solutions here tested could be \n\nalso remarkable considering the industry potential interest.  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nREFERENCES\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences \n\n175 \n \n\nAhmadi B, Al-Khaja W.

Criteria are \ndefined and controlled to guaranty the final product established specifications. Bottom ash \nfrom eucalyptus bark combustion in a bubbling fluidized bed was tested in partial \nsubstitution of the standard aggregate (granulometric calibrated sand) used in industrial \nmortars. The relevant characteristics of the new mortars were then evaluated and compared \nwith those of the reference (ash-free formulations). Results revealed that bottom ash has \npotential to be recycled in these products, but pre-treatment operations are needed to the \nash, particularly to remove soluble salts. \n\nKeywords: Biomass, bottom ash, fluidized bed combustion, mortars. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nThe solid biomass combustion is a proven technology for heat and power generation, and \nfluidized bed and grate furnace equipments are the most common [1; 2]. Fluidized bed \ncombustion (FBC) has been used due its economic and environmental benefits in burning \nlow-grade coals, biomass and organic wastes, and thereby mixtures of them [1; 3]. These \nfurnaces have been applied since 1960 for combustion of municipal solid wastes and \nindustrial wastes. Since 1980, more than eight hundred commercial circulating fluidised \nbed boilers have been put into operation in China [4]. In Portugal, the first installation \nstarted running 20 years ago, in pulp and paper producing industries and also to burn tires \n[3]. Nowadays, Portugal has several plants operating with the fluidized bed technology and \nthe future scenario predicts the construction of more units [5]. As a consequence, the \namount of ashes generated from the process will increase considerably. The high level of \ninert material (soil and little stones from the forest) fed together with the biomass in the \nPortuguese BFBC plants [6] implies a relatively high frequency of bottom bed discharge. \nThe production of industrial pre-mixed mortars exceeds one million tons in Portugal, \nconsuming then a huge amount of natural pre-treated raw materials (e.g. quarried sand) as \naggregates. This activity can be looked as a target for the incorporation of ashes, as \ncurrently happens with the fly ashes from the coal combustion in concrete [7]. \nIn this work, the coarse sand fraction used in mortars formulations was (partially and \ncompletely) substituted by the bottom ash produced during fluidized (bubbling) bed \ncombustion of biomass. The ash was used in two conditions: (i) as collected and just sieved \nto obtain a compatible grain size distribution; (ii) and pre-washed (to diminish the amount \nof chlorides) and then sieved. The leaching of chlorides from the components of mortar \nmixes is mandatory, since they cause deleterious effects [8; 9; 10]. The control of grain \n\n\n\nAsh Utilisation 2012, Stockhom, SWEDEN \n\n \n\nsize distribution of the aggregates is crucial to adjust the fresh (e.g. workability) and \nhardened (e.g. mechanical strength) properties of the mortars. \n\nMETHODOLOGY \n\nMaterial \n\nThe ordinary Portland cement used was CEM I 42.5 R, while the bottom-ashes were \ncollected in an industrial fluidized (bubbling) bed combustor using biomassa as fuel in a \npaper-pulp producer (BA \u2013 sieved and used as collected) or BAT pre-treated \u2013The \nindustrial leaching was performed in continuous and under typical conditions used in an \nindustry that makes treatment of natural sand for the construction industry. The leaching \nprocedure includes a continuous shower like process using a L/S (liquid to solid) ratio \nequal to 2, and a processing capacity of 10 ton/h; the process includes treatment of the \nleaching solution by sedimentation in order to reuse the liquid solution on the leaching \nprocess.The chemical composition of ashes was analyzed for some chemical elements \nusing X-Ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy \u2013XRF (using a Panalytical Axios spectrometer) \nand the results are expressed in terms of metal oxides, while the crystalline phases were \ndetected by X-ray diffraction \u2013 DRX (equipment RIGAKU-Geiger flex diffractometer). \nResults are presented in Table 1. The grain size distribution was determined by sieving \naccording to NP EN 933:1/2000. The fine grain sand fraction (S1) has particles between 63 \nand to 250 \u00b5 m, while the coarse fraction (S2) is constituted by larger particles, as shown in \nFigure 1; in the figure it is also presented the grain size distribution of BA and BAT. \nFinally, the Limestone Filler (LSF) has particles between 0.41 to 19.50 \u00b5 m, as determined \nby laser interference (Coulter LS230 \u2013 measurement interval of 0.04; 2000mm). \n\nTable 1.

Grain size distribution of BA, BAT and S2, determined according to EN \n\n933:1/2000. \n\nMortars formulations and characterization \n\nSpecific rendering mortars with different amounts of BA and BAT (0, 25, 50 and 100%) \nwere produced and tested. BA and BAT were introduced replacing in the formulations the \ncoarser sand (S2). Portland cement (type I 42.5R) was used as binder and the binder to \naggregates mass ratio was kept at 1:6. The amount of water for mixing was fixed (16.5% of \ntotal mass). \nThe particle size distribution of powdered and dried mortars (dust) was controlled \naccording to EN 933-1:2000 standard [11]. The preparation of samples included: (i) water \nweighting and addition to the solids; (ii) mixing for 30s at a low rotation speed (60 rpm); \n(iii) stopping for 1 min; (iv) mixing again for 1 min at the same low speed and, (v) keep the \nmixture in stand by for 10 minutes before testing. Fresh state properties were also assessed. \nWorkability was evaluated by the spread diameter on the flow table (according to EN \n1015-3:1999) [12] and setting time was measured according to EN 196-3:2005 standard \n[13] (Vicamatic - Automatic Recording Vicat Apparatus). Regarding the hardened state \nmortar properties, specimens with 40\u00d740\u00d7160 mm were produced and tested after 7 and 28 \ndays of curing, according to EN 1015-11:1999 [14]. Compressive and flexural strength \nwere evaluated with these samples.

In particular, the reduction of chlorides (about 60%) is \nvery important for this application. Their presence usually has an effect of anticipation of \nsetting time, but deleterious effects are mostly observed on hardened bodies. \nTable 3 gives the particle size distributions of the prepared formulations, obviously related \nwith the size distribution of each single component (Figure 1).  \nS2 aggregate present a broader size distribution: below 0.1 mm and up to 1.25 mm, with 50 \nvol. % of particles comprised in the 0.5 mm upper fraction. By contrast, BA has a narrower \ndistribution (~90 vol. % between the 1mm and 0,5 mm fractions). The washing process \nseems to destroy some agglomerates of BA, and then BAT contains more particles below \n0.5 mm. Its distribution approaches that of S2 size distribution. The control of particle size \nis crucial to define the compactness of the mixtures, then affecting physical and hydration \nbehaviour of cementitious mortars. \nIn  \n\nState Minimum Maximum\n\n 1.600 mm 0.0 0.0\n\n1.250 mm 0.0 1.0\n\n0.630 mm 9.0 17.00\n\n0.315 mm 16.0 43.0\n\n0.160 mm 12.0 35.0\n\n0.080 mm 2.0 15.0\n\n&lt;0.080 mm 23.0 33.0\n\n1.1 1.2\n\n1.65 1.80\n\n150 180\n\nBeggining 300 450\n\nEnd 400 550\n\n1.5 --\n\n3.5 --\n\nWater/Cement (%)\n\nFresh\n\nSetting time (min)\n\nHardened at 28 days\nFlexural Strength (MPa)\n\nCompressive Strength (MPa)\n\nCharacteristics\n\nGrain size \ndistribution (%)\n\nDust\n\nDensity (g/cm3)\n\nFlow table (mm)\n\n\n\nAsh Utilisation 2012, Stockhom, SWEDEN \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2 it is shown the setting time and values of spread diameter on the flow table for the \n\nmixtures.

The use of BA and BAT tends to diminish setting time, as a \n\npossible consequence of the presence of chlorides in the ash. This effect is more \npronounced with the use of BA since it has more chlorides. \n\n \nTable 3.

Rendering mortars mechanical strength results at 7 and 28 days. \n\nThe workability of the mortars also tend to diminish when the ash is used (the spread \ndiameter is lower) and mortars in which the S2 aggregate was fully replaced by BA or \nBAT, workability reached the lower limit. Specifications recommend spread diameters \nbetween 150 and 180 mm. The lack of fluidity in ash-containing samples might also result \nfrom a poor particles arrangement and a need for kneading water content adjustment.  \nFigure 3 gives the mechanical strength of mortars cured for 7 and 28 days. All samples \nshow values well above the required limits: 1.5 and 3.5 MPa, respectively on flexion and \ncompression strength. Differences between distinct compositions are not relevant and the \nreplacement of S2 by ashes did not degrade the mechanical behavior.  \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\nApart the concern about the presence of chlorides in the ashes, this study suggests that the \nuse of the waste in the formulation of rendering mortars, as a substitute of sand, is \npromising. Workability and mechanical strength in mortar containing ashes could be \ncontrolled and kept on the range for required values for conventional mortars. However, \nfurther tests should be conducted to prove the sustainability of the proposed solution. \nLong-term or durability tests are also recommended. \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n\nThe authors want to acknowledge the financial support by Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a \nTecnologia (FCT), Portugal, through the project with reference PTDC/AAC-\nAMB/098112/2008 (Bias-to-soil - Biomass ash: Characteristics in relation to its origin, \ntreatment and application to soil) and SFRH/BD/75182/2010. \n \n \n \n\n0,0\n\n2,0\n\n4,0\n\n6,0\n\n8,0\n\n10,0\n\n12,0\n\n1,0\n\n1,4\n\n1,8\n\n2,2\n\n2,6\n\n3,0\n\n3,4\n\n3,8\n\nC\no\n\nm\np\n\nre\nss\n\niv\ne\n S\n\ntr\ne\nng\n\nth\n (\n\nM\nP\n\na)\n\nF\nle\n\nxu\nra\n\nl \nS\n\ntr\nen\n\ng\nth\n\n (\nM\n\nP\na\n)\n\nSamples\n\nFlexural 7 days Flexural 28 days\n\nCompressive 7 days Compressive 28 days\n\nFlexural Low Limit Compressive Low limit\n\n\n\nAsh Utilisation 2012, Stockhom, SWEDEN \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n[1] Van Loo, S., J.

In this paper, \na potential waste management solution was evaluated regarding the viability of \nthis waste incorporation with a clear benefit in terms of natural raw materials \nsavings. \nThe lime-mud characterization and its incorporation in cement-based mortars \nwere appraised. The lime-mud effect on fresh and hardened state properties in \ndifferent mortars formulations was assessed. Workability and mechanical strength \nwere some of the critical features evaluated in this work.  \nDue to the high moisture content of this waste, the work was developed with the \nwaste in its natural state, saving water and energy costs, taking into account \nenvironmental and economic factors by avoiding the waste pre-treatment. \n\nKeywords: Lime-mud; cement-mortars; waste management. \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nLarge amounts of industrial wastes have been stabilized with cement or used as an additive \nmaterial in cement related manufacturing sector [1;2;3]. The pulp and paper industry is a \nsource of a wide range of solid residues. Both inorganic (ash, dregs and grits) and organic \n(sludges) solid wastes are generated during the different stages in bleached kraft pulp \nproduction. The chemical composition of the sludge, dregs and grits is dependent on the \nmanufacturing and effluent treatment processes and raw materials, and the composition of \nthe ash is dependent on the fuels and combustion techniques used at individual mills [4]. \nAlternative ecological and economic waste recovery techniques have been developed and \nimplemented in pulp and paper industry due to the increase in the amount of waste and the \npressure from public opinion in the last decade. Waste handling is a concern in pulp and \npaper mills as well as in all industrial plants [5]. Best available techniques for reducing \nwaste involve minimizing the generation of solid waste or to reuse these materials, \nwhenever practicable [6]. Building construction industry is a valid option to drain large \nquantitative of solid wastes and, as a consequence, avoid natural resources use. Several \nauthors have been studying several alternatives of pulp and paper wastes valorisation \nreplacing partially or completely conventional raw materials. Ahmadi and Alkhaja (2001) \n[7] tested with success primary sludge as a replacement filler material in concrete mixes. \nEroglu H. et al (2007) [8] studied lime mud in composite cement manufacturing and the \nresults suggested that the waste is practically an additive for this application. Considering \n\n\n\nWastes: Solutions, treatments and opportunities, 2011, Guimar\u00e3es, PORTUGAL \n\n \n\nlimestone one of the most used raw materials in the construction sector, this work intends \nto assess a solid waste with similar characteristics of limestone powder, namely as a \nstandard filler. In this work, lime-mud (LM), a solid waste mainly composed by calcium \ncarbonate and small amount of magnesium carbonate [9] generated from pulp and paper \nmill in the chemical recovery process, was studied as a replacement to a standard limestone \nmineral filler (SF) in cement-mortars. Both LM and SF were chemically, mineralogical and \nphysically characterized and the results compared. Cement based mortars were produced \nand tested. \nIn the case of mortars, workability parameters in the fresh state were measured using a \nflow table. Flow table is a traditional method to determine the workability of mortars. \nAlthough it is easy to use and widespread around the world, this technique does not \ndiscriminate the yield stress and plastic viscosity, which are important parameters to define \nthe rheological behavior of mortars [10,11]. For that reason, a rheometer has been used for \nthis purpose. In terms of the rheological behaviour, mortars typically behave as a Bingham \nfluid, being characterized by a yield stress and a plastic viscosity. The rheological \nbehaviour was studied with a specific mortar rheometer (Viskomat PC, Schleibinger) that \nis able to quantify those factors. This apparatus automatically measures torque, up to a \nlimit of 300 N.mm, following a preset speed-time program. The Bingham behaviour can be \nexpressed as the torque (T) to rotation speed (N) relation, T = g + hN, where g and h are \ncoefficients directly proportional to yield stress and plastic viscosity, respectively [12-15]. \nAdditionally, the mechanical strength up to 28 days of curing, the apparent density, water \nabsorption and porosity were measured. \n\nEXPERIMENTAL \n\nMaterials \n\nThe ordinary Portland cement (PC) used in this study was a CEM II 32.5 R type produced \nby Secil (Portugal). The lime-mud was collected from paper pulp mill, where 420.000 \nt/year of this waste in dry base is produced. It is an industrial solid waste obtained from re-\ncausticizing process inserted in the chemical recovery process circuit. The calibrated \nstandard limestone mineral filler was a commercial one. This material is conventionally \nused as filler in industrial mortars. PC has an average particle size of 14 \u00b5m and a Blaine \nfineness of 0.47m2/g, LM has a particle size distribution between 0.5 to 26 \u00b5 m (average 10 \n\u00b5 m) and a surface area of 5.17 m2/g (BET) and the SF has a particle size distribution \nbetween 0.5 to 9 \u00b5 m (average 2.8 \u00b5 m) and a surface area of 3.44 m2/g (BET). The sand \nparticle size was below 1,2 mm (EN 933-1: 2000) [16]. The chemical composition data \n(determined by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy) of LM and SF are illustrated in Table 1.  \n \n\n\n\nWastes: Solutions, treatments and opportunities, 2011, Guimar\u00e3es, PORTUGAL \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.Lime-mud (scanning electronic microscope photograph). \n\nTable 4. Chemical composition of lime-mud (LM) and standard filler (SF). \n\n \n\nMethods \n\nMortars using different amounts of lime-mud and standard lime filler (0, 6, 12 and 18 %) \nwere produced and tested (Table 2). Lime-mud was used in its natural condition, as-\nreceived from the paper pulp mill with 34% of moisture. This LM water was discounted \nfrom nominal water content used to produce the mortars. The total water and the \nsuperplasticiser used in the mortars mixtures were 62% and 0.07% in relation to cement \ncontent, respectively. The LM and SF were used as fillers in substitution of sand by weight \nin dry base. The formulations were evaluated through rheology and flow table \nmeasurements, assuring that all the samples exhibited an adequate condition to be tested in \nboth equipments. In this way, it was possible to obtain a complete characterization of their \nfresh state behavior. A complementary study of these mortars in the hardened state was \nalso developed. \nThe procedures used to prepare the formulations included: (i) placing lime-mud and the \nrest of mortar components into water; (ii) mixing for 1 min at a low rotation speed of 60 \nrpm; (iii) stopping for 1 min; (iv) mixing again for 1 min at a higher rotation speed (120 \nrpm). The rheometer measured the rheological behavior of fresh mortars, with a maximum \nspeed rotation of 100 rpm during 60 minutes of total test time. The workability of mortars \nwas measured through the \u201cslump\u201d on flow table, according to EN 1015-3:1999 [17]. \nMortars specimens with 40 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 160 mm were produced for the mechanical test and \ntested after 28 curing, according to EN 1015-11:1999 [18]. Specific density, apparent \nporosity and water absorption were also determined with two flexural specimen remains by \nthe immersion technique. \n\nCaO MgO Al2O3 SiO2 K2O Na2O Fe2O3 LOI\n\nLM 51.80 0.48 0.20 0.29 0.06 1.85 0.03 43.7\nSF 55.1 0.37 0.35 0.20 0.01 0.01 0.05 44.3\n\nSample\n%\n\n\n\nWastes: Solutions, treatments and opportunities, 2011, Guimar\u00e3es, PORTUGAL \n\n \n\nTable 5. Cement-mortars formulations. \n\n \n \nResults and Discussion \n\nThe high content of CaCO3 in LM makes this waste an interesting material to be used as \nfiller, although LM and SF exhibited some significant differences like the particle size, \nspecific surface area and Na2O content. For that reason, such differences may be the main \nresponsible for distinct performance on the mortars.  \nFig. 2 exhibits the torque values of mortars containing LM, SF and control (0%). In \ngeneral, the torque values of samples with LM reached the highest results if compared to \nthe SF substitution. \nWhen very fine particles with higher surface area are added in the mortars, they can modify \nthe fresh state behavior, since the free water available in the mixture tend to decrease. \nThus, particle friction in such samples is higher than those samples without additions. \nMoreover, in the control sample, the superplasticiser can act exclusively on the cement \nparticles increasing the free water, responsible for keeping particles separate by a certain \ndistance. In addition, describing mortars rheological behavior as a Bingham fluid means \nthat the material acts as a rigid body at low stresses but flows, as a viscous fluid, at high \nstress having a linear relationship between shear stress and strain rate once the threshold \nshear stress is exceeded [12]. The vertical lines above the torque line of the mixtures (fig. \n2) indicate intense structural formation during the test stop period (when rotation speed \ngoes to zero rpm). Such behavior was more evident on the samples with higher content of \nLM and at the end of the test.  \n \n\nCement Sand\nFree \n\nWater\n\nLM \n\nWater\n\nLM \n\n(d.b.)\n\nSF \n\n(d.b.)\n\nRatio \n\n(Filler/Cement/Sand) \n\n0% 445 1335 276 0 0 0 0 / 25 / 75\n\nLM6% 445 1255 232 44 80 0 4.5 / 25 / 70.5\nLM12% 445 1175 189 87 160 0 9 / 25 / 66\n\nLM18% 445 1095 145 131 240 0 13.5 / 25 / 61.5\n\nSF6% 445 1255 276 0 0 80 4.5 / 25 / 70.5\n\nSF12% 445 1175 276 0 0 160 9 / 25 / 66\n\nSF18% 445 1095 276 0 0 240 13.5 / 25 / 61.5\n\nMortars \n\n(g)\n\n\n\nWastes: Solutions, treatments and opportunities, 2011, Guimar\u00e3es, PORTUGAL \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.

The formulations were prepared using two types of sludges (LS \u2013 \nLoom sludge and PS \u2013 Polishing sludge) in 5 and 10% (wt %) of cement replacement with \nwater/cement ratio of 0.6. The sludges were also tested in cement paste replacement in \n10% (wt%) with water/cement ratio of 0.45. The mortars formulations were defined \nthrough the flow table and rheometer behavior purposing to achieve a suitable workability. \nThe appraised properties were rheology, spread, heat of hydration, physics (density, \nporosity and water absorption) and compressive strength (at 28 days). Results obtained \nshowed that 10% cement replacement by the sludge provided mortars production without \nassociated damages to the final product. This waste valorisation represents an important \nwaste outflow for the ornamental stones sector, avoiding wastes landfill disposal. \n\nIntroduction \n\nIn recent years, the environmental damage and the wastes generated from industrial activity, \nincreased significantly worldwide. Thus, the raw natural materials have become scarce and \nthe adverse impacts on the environment are visible [1, 2, 3]. The ornamental stones \nproduction (including extraction, cutting, sawing and stone blocks polishing) generates \nabout 30 to 40% of loses [4]. In the natural stone sector, the processors convert the quarries \nextracted blocks in intended pieces for floor coverings, household applications, the funerary \nart, sculpture and more. The subsector includes extracting and processing companies, \nmainly limestone and granite, whose production is intended primarily for the construction \nsector (inert or granules and gravel), and also to the chemical, steel-metallurgy and food \nprocessing. This is an important activity in Portugal. There are over 1250 companies in this \nsector and 11,000 over employees. The global production in terms of raw material processed \nis mentioned in more than 1.6 million tonnes [5]. The extraction and processing involves \nessentially two natural stone types, marble and granite. The sludges are the main generated \nwaste (LER 01 05 04). Generally, their composition is stone waste, sand, lime and \nsometimes steel balls (due to the abrasive material recirculation). Sawing, cutting and \npolishing operations produce about 0.10 m3 of sludge per ton of processed stone: 0.08 m3 of \nsawdust in the operation and 0.02 m3 in grinding and cutting. (one cubic meter of sludge is \nequivalent to 2,7 tonnes). [6]. The ornamental stone sludge is a fine particle with high \ntendency to agglomerate, difficulty a homogenous distribution in the mixtures. The fine \nparticles can act as micro filler in the matrix, but at same time decreases the workability of \n\n\n\nVI International Materials Symposium, Materials 2011, Braga, PORTUGAL \n\n \n\nmortars. Although, the sludge is not considered a hazardous waste (Class I), in many cases, \nthere is no concern in these tailings reutilization and, therefore, they are dumped in lakes \nand rivers directly without any pre-treatment. \nNowadays, the final disposal or the reutilization of fine powder from ornamental stones \nindustry as industrial wastes are considered one of the biggest environmental problems \nworldwide [7]. In this way, many attempts [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] have been testing such wastes, \nespecially in the construction industry, as tile, asphalt aggregate, brick, cement, concrete, clay \nproducts. So, it is possible to minimize the waste environmental negative impact and at same \ntime add it some value. Although, some authors [10, 7, 8] have been tested the stone marble \nsludge in mortars, the use of rheology and spread on table are rarely used as considered \nparameters to define the mortars formulations. The flow table is a traditional method used in \nmortars to determine workability. It does not measure the yield stress and plastic viscosity \nseparately due its constant load application. So, the rheometer has been used for this purpose. \nTraditionally, mortars, cement paste and concrete rheological behavior has been measured by \nthe Bingham model. \nThe rheometer is capable of measures the rheological parameters for a wide values range at \nsame time. The cement mixtures rheological behavior is described by the Bingham \nequation:  \n? = ?o \u00b5p?                                                                                                                            (1) \n where ? (Pa) is the shear stress, ?o (Pa) is the yield stress, \u00b5p (Pa*s) is the plastic viscosity \nand ? (s-1) is the shear rate. Some rheometers measures torque T as a function of rotational \nspeed N then the Bingham model has been also expressed by the following equation:  \nT = g + hN                                                                                                                          (2) \nwhere g (N mm) and h (N mm min) are directly proportional to the yield stress and plastic \nviscosity respectively. \nSystematic studies applying a methodology of experimental design are not frequently used \nin cement based materials. However, they can assist to identify the main effects and their \ninteractions of the constituents [chemical admixtures, mineral additions and W/B \n(water/binder) ratio][14]. \nThis paper aims to reuse the ornamentals stone sludge, as cement partial replacement (0, 5 \nand 10 wt %) to produce mortars based on mixtures formulation according to flow table \nand rheology performance. \n\nExperimental \n\nMaterials \n\nThe Portland cement used in this paper was a CEM I 42.5 R. It has an average particle of \n14 \u00b5m and the Blaine fineness 0.35 m2/g, while the chemistry composition is showed in \nTable 1. Loom sludge (LS) and polishing sludge (PS) were used in dried condition as \nreplaced of Portland cement. LS has a particle size distribution between 1.50 to 77.8 \u00b5 m \nand average 15.7 \u00b5 m and surface area of 3.7 m2/g (BET), while PS has between 1.23 to \n55.6 \u00b5 m and average 11.2 \u00b5 m and  7.2 m2/g, respectively. The chemistry compositions was \nobtained by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (Shimadzu, EDX-700), while the \npozzolanicity was determined by Standard EN 196-5:2005 [15].  \n\nMortars and paste testing procedures  \n\n\n\nVI International Materials Symposium, Materials 2011, Braga, PORTUGAL \n\n \n\nMortars and pastes were produced, using different amounts (5 and 10 wt%) of ornamental \nsludge. Mortars with 1:3 cement/aggregate weight ratio and 0.6 water/cement weight ratio \n(w/c) were produced to rheology, flow table, compressive strength, water absorption and \napparent porosity. Meanwhile, the cement paste with 0.45 w/c was utilized to the \ntemperature of hydration. The components were weighed and mixed in the mechanical \nmixing (CONTROLS, 65-LS). The procedures included: (i) Water addition to the dry \npowder mix; (ii) Mix for 1 min at a low rotation speed of 60 rpm; (iii) Stop for 1 min to \ngather the mix into the centre; (iv) Mix again for 1 min at a higher rotation speed (120 \nrpm). The rheological behaviour of fresh mortars was measured by a rheometer (Viskomat \nPC). It was used a maximum speed rotation (100 rpm) and 250 minutes of test time. The \nworkability of mortar was measured through \u201cspread\u201d on flow table according to EN 1015-\n3:1999 [16]. For the mechanical test, mortars specimens with 40 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 160 mm were \nperformed. The moulds were covered with plastic bags for 24 h to avoid water loss. After \n24 h, all the samples were immersed in water for curing during 27 days and the \ncompressive strength was determined by EN 1015-11:1999 [17]. Water absorption, \nporosity and apparent density were also determined by the immersive techniques [18]. The \nheat of hydration was tested in cement paste samples during 24 h. This parameter was \nmeasured in a quasiadiabatic calorimeter (Langavant). The cement pastes were thermally \nisolated in boxes stored in a curing chamber at 20 ?C of temperature and 65% of relative \nhumidity. \n\nTable 8. Chemical composition of Portland cement CEM I \u2013 42.5R. \n\n \n\nResults and Discussion \n\nRheology and flow table measurements \n\nWhen ultra fines particles with higher surface area than Portland cement are used in \nmortars, they can modify the fresh and hardened properties. If flow table and rheometer are \nused to define a set of formulations of mortars, the maximum amount to be added is \nreduced, since the minimum plasticity requires for such equipments are different. On the \nother hand, it permits to achieve a better characterization. In general, the torque values and \nyield stress changed markedly when the Portland cement was replaced to sludges (Fig. 1 \n\nMaterial PS LS Binder\n\nCharacteristics\nSludge from \n\npolishing process\nSludge from cutting \n\n(loom) process\nPortland Cement (CEM I 42,5)  \n\nSecil (Maceira)\n\nMoisture (%) 37,4 38,4&lt;1\n\nSiO2 (%) 65,9 57,7 20,4\n\nAl2O3 (%) 12,1 16,0 5,2\n\nFe2O3 T (%) 11,0 6,1 3,1\n\nMgO (%) 0,1 2,5 2,0\n\nCaO (%) 3,2 6,3 65,7\n\nNa2O (%) 2,1 2,3 nd\n\nK2O (%) 5,1 4,4 1,4\n\nTiO2 (%) 0,2 1,4 0,3\n\nP2O5 (%) 0,1 0,6 0,1\n\nL.O.I.

However, the plastic viscosity did not show a noticeable difference (Table 2). \nSuch additions exhibit higher surface area than particle cement and consequently, the free \nwater available in the mixture decreased. As consequence, the particle friction and three-\ndimensional structures formation tend to increases.  \n\nTable 9.

As PS has \na higher surface area than LS, a high value of initial torque was obtained. On the other \nhand, such characteristic was not enough to keep the results above the LS level after 75 \nmin. In addition, both sludges samples showed low plasticity and the Bingham model \naccuracy became poorer, while the vertical line above of the torque line shows intense \nstructures formation during the test stop period. \n\nSample\nFlow \nTable\n\nTorque\nYield \nstress\n\nViscosity\nHeat of \n\nhydration\nBulk\n\nWater \nabsorption\n\nPorosity\nCompressive \nStrengh (28 \n\ndays)\n\nmm N mm min (*) N mm N mm \u00baC (105' ) g/cm3 % % MPa\nControl 218 58,45 29,5 0,14 23,62 2,01 9,82 19,78 34,35\nPS5% 2,00 10,16 20,34 33,19\nPS10% 205 72,35 34,8 0,14 24,20 2,00 10,18 20,28 32,59\nLS5% 1,99 9,94 19,83 32,91\nLS10% 207 79,47 43,7 0,13 24,00 1,99 10,29 20,44 31,53\n(*) Registered value at minute 105 of the rheology test.\n\n10\n\n30\n\n50\n\n70\n\n90\n\n110\n\n130\n\n0 15 30 45 60 75 90 105 120 135 150\n\nTime (min)\n\nT\nor\n\nqu\ne \n\n(N\n m\n\nm\n)\n\nControl PS10% LS10%\n\n\n\nVI International Materials Symposium, Materials 2011, Braga, PORTUGAL \n\n \n\n \nFigure 9.

In \nthe first peaks, the cement replaced by PS and LS seems that was determinate to the \nresults. However, such formulations showed lower dormant period, as well as, increased \nfaster the temperature in relation to the control (Fig. 3). Thus, the hydraulic charter of \nsludges can be appointing as responsible for the results. In addition, the heterogeneous \nchemical activation nuclei can be also considered to the results.

Ornamental stones sludges pozzolanicity results. \n\nWater absorption, apparent porosity and compressive strength \n\nThe addition of ultrafine particles in cement based materials can contribute to fill out the \nspace (physical effect \u2013 Table 2) or react with calcium hydroxide (pozzolanic effect \u2013 Fig. \n4), resulting in calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H). In general, the results showed that up to \n10% of sludge incorporation doesn\u2019t modify significantly the physical properties of \nmortars. Probably, the microfiller effect can contribute to the results, despite the reduction \nof cement in the material. However, the compressive strength was reduced significantly, \ndespite the material exhibits pozzolanic effect. In this case, this characteristic was attenuate \nby cement replaced (Table 2). \n\nConclusions \n\nThe optimal working interval definition for fresh mortars based on simultaneous \ninformation obtained from flow table and rheometer tests is complex. The reduction of \nplasticity of mortars is denoted by enhance of applied torque, while there is a spread \nreduction in the flow table test. In both cases, this tendency could be explained by an \nincreasing friction between surface grains and plasticity lost. It is feasible to use the \nrheometer to evaluate the mortars rheological parameters. Increasing finer mortars content \nthought ornamental stone sludge addition increases the torque and the yield stress. A \nverified advantage was to replace 10% of cement by ornamental stones sludge without \nbringing material damages. 10% of theses sludges addition doesn\u2019t modify significantly the \nmortars physical and mechanical properties. According to the exposed, cement can be 10% \nreplaced in mortars production without associated damages to the final product. This waste \nvalorisation represents an important waste outflow for the ornamental stones sector, \navoiding wastes landfill disposal. \n\nReferences \n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n45 55 65 75 85 95\n\nHydroxil ion concentration (mmol/l)\n\nC\nal\n\nci\nu\n\nm\n i\n\no\nn\n\n c\no\n\nn\nce\n\nn\ntr\n\nat\nio\n\nn\n (\n\nm\nm\n\no\nl/\n\nl)\n  \n\n  \n \n\nCurve of calcium ion concentration\n\nPS\nLS\n\nPozzolanicity area\n\n\n\nVI International Materials Symposium, Materials 2011, Braga, PORTUGAL \n\n \n\n[1] Binici, H., Shah T., Aksogan, O., Kaplan H., Durability of concrete made with \ngranite and marble as recycle aggregates, Journal of Materials Processing Technology 208 \n(2008) 299\u2013308. \n[2] UMTC, Use of recycled materials and recycled products in highway construction, \nUniversity of Massachusetts Transportation Center Report UMTC-95-1, US, 1995, pp. \n238\u2013245. \n[3] OECD, Road Transport Research: Recycling Strategies for Road Works. \nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Paris, France, 1997, \npp. 140\u2013148. \n[4] NITES - N\u00facleo Regional de Informa\u00e7\u00e3o Tecnol\u00f3gica do Esp\u00edrito Santo, \n\u201cDesperd\u00edcio na Ind\u00fastria de M\u00e1rmore e Granito.

In \nthis way, the experimental research here presented evaluates the influence of Red Mud \nparticles (RM) on the fresh and hardened properties of cured mortars up to 28 days. \nPortland cement was replaced up to 50 wt.% RM, adjusting the relative amount of water \n(36\u201348 wt.%) in order to get mortars with suitable workability as defined by rheometry and \nflow table measurements. Temperature of hydration, water absorption and compressive \nstrength were also determined. RM decreases the workability and increases the yield stress \nof the material. Mortars with similar spread on table showed different behaviour along the \nrheology test. RM did not change significantly the dormant period, but the magnitude of \nexothermic peak is reduced when the Portland cement was replaced by RM above 20 wt.%. \nThe water absorption increased when the cement was replaced by RM, while the \ncompressive strength exhibited an opposite tendency.  \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe red mud is a residue generated in large scale from the Bayer process used to produce \nalumina. Through this process, bauxite is digested in a concentrated caustic soda (NaOH) \nsolution at high pressure and moderate temperatures (~270 \u00baC), in order to obtain the \nalumina trihydrate (Al2O3.3H2O) [1][2]. This process leads to the formation of insoluble \nhydroxides where the impurities are concentrated, after proper washing, settling, and \nfiltration operations. Such is the case of the red mud, containing goethite (?-FeOOH), \nhematite (?-Fe2O3), bohemite (?AlO(OH)), quartz (SiO2), sodalite (Na4Al3SiO12Cl), and \ngypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) as major phases, and calcite (CaCO3), whewellite (CaC2O4.H2O), \ngibbsite (Al(OH)3), and TiO2 as minor components [1]. In general, the production of 1 ton \nalumina generates 1-2 ton (dry basis) of red mud. Thus, the storage of these massive \namounts is economically and environmentally problematic, due to the risk of \ncontamination of natural resources and living organisms [3][4]. Therefore, the main \npurpose of this work is investigating the impact of red mud on the rheological properties of \n\n\n\nI Congresso Luso-Brasileiro de Materiais de Constru\u00e7\u00e3o Sustent\u00e1veis 2014, Braga, PORTUGAL \n\n \n\nmortars. Complementary fresh and hardened state properties of mixtures are also \nevaluated. \n\nMaterials and Methods \n\nPortland cement (PC - type I 42.5R, according to EN 197-1 [5] was used as binder. It has a \nspecific area of 0.35 m2/g (Blaine fineness), average particle size of 14 \u00b5m and its \nchemical composition is given in Table 10. Red mud (RM) slurry (Alcoa, Spain), here used \nas partial substitute of Portland cement, contains about 61 wt.% solids, specific area of 20 \nm2/g, particle size distribution between 0.1 to 7 \u00b5m (average 0.78 \u00b5m), and chemical \ncomposition illustrated in Table 10. Superplasticizer (SP) used to adjust the plasticity of \nfresh mortars is based on a polycarboxylic acid (Glenium 52, Basf), with density between \n1.067-1.107g/cm\u00b3. The sand used as aggregate is composed by three particle size fractions \n(1.2, 0.6 and 0.3 mm), each one corresponding to 33.33 wt.%. \n \n\nTable 10 Chemical composition of Portland cement CEM I \u2013 42.5R as red mud determined by XRF. \nComponent  Portland Cement (wt.%) Red Mud  (wt.%) \n\nSiO2 20.37 5.54 \n\nCaO 63.05 3.27 \n\nAl2O3 4.78 18.76 \n\nFe2O3 2.96 51.8 \n\nSO3 3.70 0.23 \n\nMgO 2.02 - \n\nCl- 0.02 - \n\nNa2O - 6.84 \n\nK2O - 0.08 \n\nTiO2 - 11.18 \n\nMnO - 0.04 \n\nLoss On Ignition 2.37 0.16 \n\nTesting procedures \n\nThe RM particles were used as partial substitute of Portland cement, in levels up to 50 wt% \n(Table 11 and Figure 1). An extra dosage of water (W) was required in mixtures containing \nmore than 15 % RM to keep the spread value in 200 mm. In addition, the SP was fixed in \n0.25 wt.% and binder-to-aggregate weight ratio was also fixed (1:3). Red mud was used in \nthe as-received condition (as a paste), and the quantity of water incorporated by the RM \nwas considered to reduce the volume required to prepare each mixture. The solid \ncomponents of the blends were mixed inside a plastic bag for 1 min, while the \nsuperplasticizer was mixed into water, before addition to the solids. The mixing of the \npaste was conducted for 3.5 min. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nI Congresso Luso-Brasileiro de Materiais de Constru\u00e7\u00e3o Sustent\u00e1veis 2014, Braga, PORTUGAL \n\n \n\nTable 11 Mortar formulations. \n\nWet basis (wt.%) Dry basis (wt.%) \nCement RM Water Cement RM \n64.0 0.0 36.0 100 0 \n59.4 4.7 36.0 92.7 7.3 \n52.7 9.3 38.0 85 15 \n49.5 12.4 38.1 80 20 \n42.0 18.0 40.0 70 30 \n34.0 22.7 43.3 60 40 \n26.0 26.0 48.0 50 50 \n\n \n \n\n \nFigure 1 Experimental space showing the prepared mixtures. \n\n \nThe rheological behaviour of fresh mortars was measured in a rheometer (Viskomat PC, \nGermany) for testing cement pastes and mortars (Figure 2a), while the flow table (Figure \n2b) was performed immediately after mixing, following the EN 1015-3 [6].  \n \n\n \nFigure 2 (a) Rheometer and (b) flow table test. \n\nThe maximum rotation speed was 100 rpm and at every 15 min the speed was brought to \nzero, kept as that for 30 s, and was then increased to 100 rpm during 30 s. The rheological \nparameters, namely, plastic viscosity (h) and yield stress (g) were obtained from Bingham \nmodel [7].  \n\n\n\nI Congresso Luso-Brasileiro de Materiais de Constru\u00e7\u00e3o Sustent\u00e1veis 2014, Braga, PORTUGAL \n\n \n\nThe temperature of hydration was monitored in a quasi-adiabatic calorimeter (Langavant), \nwhile the water absorption of hardened mortars was determined by an immersive technique \n[8]. The compression strength was determined according to the EN 1015-11 standard [9]. \nSamples with 40 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 160 mm were used, as prescribed by EN 196-1 [10]. The curing \nwas firstly conducted in room conditions with samples placed inside the moulds (covered \nby plastic bags and for 24 h), followed by immersion in water for 28 days. \n\nResults and Discussion \n\nRheometry and flow table measurements \n\nWhen the flow table and rheometer were used as parameters for determining the \ncomposition of mixtures, an additional difficulty in defining the experimental plan was \nobserved. Such equipments differ in terms of minimum plasticity required. To evaluate the \neffect of higher levels of RM in mortars, it was necessary to fix the value of spread on \ntable (200 mm), in a condition that permits their evaluation in the rheometer and flow \ntable, simultaneously. \nIn general, RM particles increased the yield stress and plastic viscosity regardless the water \ncontent added (Figure 3). As RM particles are smaller and have higher surface area than \nPC grains, they reduce the amount of free water required to lubricate the solid particles. As \na result, the internal friction of particles increased and the plasticity of mixture diminished. \nIn addition, the ultra-fine particles in suspension have a stronger tendency to agglomerate, \nwhich hampers the adequate flow of the mixture. \nThe yield stress also increased by prolonging the measurements. Particle collisions, \nformation of a three-dimensional structure upon hydration, and concomitant reduction of \nfree water available are possible causes for that variation. The evolution of plastic viscosity \ndoes not show a defined tendency and, therefore, the effect of RM is better accounted by \nlooking to the yield stress. Although the values of the initial yield stress are similar for \nsamples with 20, 30 and 40 wt.% RM, they exhibited significant differences during the \nrheology test. \n\nTemperature of hydration \n\nSamples showed two main peaks on curves representing the temperature variation upon \ncuring (Figure 4). The first peak occurred in the first moments after contact with water, \nwhile the second peak has its maximum at 11-13 h but starts after 4-6 h. \nThe presence of RM particles did not accelerate the hydration process. As expected from \nthe slight hydraulic character of RM, its use as binder (PC replacement) should delay the \nhydration reactions. However, when used up to 15% differences are small when compared \nwith REF mortar (RM-free). The fineness of RM particles might be responsible for their \naction as heterogeneous chemical activation nuclei for the hydration of cement [11]. In \naddition, samples containing higher RM levels reached lower maximum temperature. \n \n\n\n\nI Congresso Luso-Brasileiro de Materiais de Constru\u00e7\u00e3o Sustent\u00e1veis 2014, Braga, PORTUGAL \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3 Rheological parameters of fresh mortar mixtures containing up to 50 wt.% RM \n\n \n \n\nFigure 4 Temperature of hydration of mortars containing up to 50 wt.% RM \n\n\n\nI Congresso Luso-Brasileiro de Materiais de Constru\u00e7\u00e3o Sustent\u00e1veis 2014, Braga, PORTUGAL \n\n \n\nWater absorption and compressive strength of hardened samples \n\nSamples showed higher water absorption when red mud and water levels increased (Figure \n5). The combined effect of RM and W strongly increased the water absorption, confirming \nagain the non-hydraulic character of the mud. Hardened samples will show higher volume \nof open pores. Despite the possible capacity of RM particles to fill in the pores of the \nmaterial, due to their fineness, this effect is not sufficient to compensate the lower extent of \nchemical reactivity and hydrates formation. As a consequence, the compression strength of \nsamples will diminish when RM level is higher (Figure 6). \n\n \nFigure 5 Water absorption (%) of mortar after curing at 28 days. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6 Compression strength (MPa) of mortars after curing at 28 days \n\n \n \nThe compressive strength of samples 7.5RM + 36W, 15RM + 38W and 30RM + 40W \nreduced respectively 12, 25 and 59% regarding the REF. RM particles can adsorb some \nwater, and then the available amount for cement hydration become insufficient to complete \nthe reactions. Mortars with 20, 30, 40 and 50 wt.% RM showed a successive loose of \nmechanical resistance, since the relative amount of cement diminished. Moreover, the \nrequired amount of water to reach suitable workability of the mixtures tends to increase, \nleaving pores after drying/curing. \n\nConclusions \n\nThe differences (relative to REF) of initial yield stress for mixtures with RM are not \nconstant and also depend on W. By contrast, the plastic viscosity does not change too \n\n\n\nI Congresso Luso-Brasileiro de Materiais de Constru\u00e7\u00e3o Sustent\u00e1veis 2014, Braga, PORTUGAL \n\n \n\nmuch. Mortars with 20, 30 and 40 wt.% RM exhibited similar values of initial yield stress, \nbut during the rheology test the behaviour of such mixtures tend to be distinct. RM does \nnot significantly delay the hydration process. However, for high RM amounts (above 20 \nwt.%) the maximum temperature decreased. Hardened samples show higher water \nabsorption and lower mechanical strength when RM level increases. This also confirms the \nnon-hydraulic character of the mud. Such tendencies are also affected by the W added. \n\nReferences \n\n[1] R.A. Hind, S.K. Bhargava, S.C.

It is a \nwaste chemical and physically homogeneous, basically composed by calcium \ncarbonate which allows valorization opportunities in the construction materials \nsector and, in this specific case study, in lightweight aggregates (LWA).  \nIn this paper, a potential management solution was evaluated regarding the viability \nof using lime mud at industrial scale. The test was developed using lime mud as \nraw material with total substitution of conventional limestone powder on \nfabrication of lightweight aggregates. The industrial process was evaluated \nconsidering some limitations on operations logistic due to the lime mud moisture \ncontent. Involved costs were estimated for the waste management solution and the \nimpact on final product basic characteristics was assessed.  \nThe obtained results indicate that lime mud presents high potential of utilisation as \nraw material in lightweight aggregate production but, in what basic characteristics \nare concerned, the waste moisture content must be taken into consideration.  \n\n \nKeywords: lime mud, lightweight aggregate, waste management  \n\n \nINTRODUCTION \n\nAccording to several authors, pulp mill industry generates various potential solid wastes \nthat could easily be used as raw material in construction sector due its basic chemical and \nphysical characteristics and, in some cases, even improve some of their properties \n0[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7].  \nThe extraction of natural aggregates for use in construction is associated with significant \nadverse environmental effects [8]. In recent years, the environmental damage and the \nwastes generated from industrial activity increased significantly worldwide. Thus, natural \nraw materials have become scarce and the adverse impacts on the environment are visible \n[9][10],[11]. Construction sector is able to drain large solid wastes and in consequence \navoid natural resources consumption [12],[13],[14]. Several types of wastes have been \nexhaustively tested in lightweight aggregates (LWA) production, but most of them have \nbeen used to replace an expansive material. Sarab\u00e8r et al (2012)[15] for example, tested fly \nash from coal fired power in this application. The results showed that adequate LWA can \nbe produced. Meanwhile, Wang et al (2009) [16] also tested coal fly ash but blended with \ndry sewage sludge. \n\n\n\n2nd WASTES: solutions, treatments and opportunities 2013, Braga, PORTUGAL \n\n \n\nIn terms of raw material, this product can be manufactured by thermally treatment of clays, \nshale, siliceous rock or slate and also uses in its composition, water and limestone coating \npowder (LSCP). The LSCP specific function in the LWAs is related with covering the \nLWA pellets surface avoiding their agglomeration in the rotary kiln and also contributes to \nthe formation of a denser external surface to avoid water absorption. \nConsidering limestone one of the most used raw-material in the construction sector, this \nwork intends to assess a solid waste from pulp mill process, namely a lime mud (LM), with \nsimilar chemical, physical and mineralogical characteristics with limestone filler, as \nreplacement material for standard LSCP conventionally used in LWAs production. LM is a \nsolid waste generated from pulp and paper mill in the chemical recovery process mainly \ncomposed of calcium carbonate and small amount of magnesium carbonate and it is \nestimated that about 0.47m3 of lime mud is generated to produce 1 ton of pulp \n[17][18],[5],[19]. In this specific study, the pulp mill generates approximately \n360ton/month (in dry base). \nFrom a waste management perspective, the focus of this study is to evaluate the \nreplacement potential of LM in lightweight aggregate production as a substitute material of \nLSCP at industrial scale. This paper presents the research work developed in industrial \nscale (process stages and final product). The comparative study of the raw-materials was \nused as criteria decision for industrial test. Energy costs related to drying lime mud process \nwas also assessed. In terms of waste flow capacity and related economic aspects of the \napplication, as well as logistic and technical problems due to LM properties (mainly related \nto moisture content) some parameters were registered and also compared. In industrial \nscale approximately 25 tons of LM in LWA production was tested. Process parameters as \nmachine stream, operation time, energy costs related to LM moisture elimination and the \nwaste transportation were measured or calculated and compared with the conventional \nprocess.   \nThe consumption of LSCP is around 300 tonsdry base/month only in one LWA mill. This fact \nimplies that the process could drain large amount of LM per year. It would permit the \ndrainage of approximately 80% of the lime mud produced in this pulp mill located around \n30km of the LWAs mill installation. This waste management option as a valorization \nsolution could avoid the waste landfilling, the reduction of natural resources extraction and \nalso to save costs for both sectors, lightweight aggregate and pulp paper industries. \nAssuming the agreement with the involved companies, this work uses the denominations \n\u201cfactory X\u201d for the pulp mill which generates the lime mud and \u201cfactory Y\u201d for the LWA \nmill with the waste final application. \n\nEXPERIMENTAL \n \nMaterials \n \nRaw-materials were characterized in terms of chemical, physical (grain size distribution \nand bulk density) and mineralogical properties. LM used in this research was collected in \nthe washing stage as illustrated in Fig 1.  \n\n\n\n2nd WASTES: solutions, treatments and opportunities 2013, Braga, PORTUGAL \n\n \n\n \nFig.1. Scheme of caustification zone from Kraft process under study. Lime mud collection spot. \n\nThis LM presents approximately 20% of moisture content. The raw-material main \ncharacteristics are presented in Table 1. The particle size distribution was determined by \nlaser diffraction in the range between 0.04 and 2000 \u00b5 m (Beckman Coulter LS230). The \ncrystalline phases present in dried materials were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) \nand the chemical composition was determined by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF). \nRaw materials weight and energy changes were also analysed by thermogravimetry and \ndifferential thermal analysis (TG/DTA). SEM (Scanning electron microscope) observation \nwas used to assess LM and LSCP microstructures. LSCP and clay pellets (CP) were \nsupplied by factory Y.  \n\nTable 1.

The data were collected each 15 minutes \nduring all period of the test. The LSCP flow (kg/h) in the entrance of rotary drum and the \nkiln average exit temperature (\u00baC) were monitored. The standard lightweight aggregate is \nreferred as LWAs and the one incorporating lime mud is named as LWAw. In both cases \ndensity and flow rate were controlled and registered.

The waste was placed near the production line equipment to \nbe used in the same day in total substitution of the conventional LSCP. The LM was \nintroduced in the system by two ways.

Thermal gravimetric and differential analyses (TG/DTA) of raw materials were \nperformed up to 1000\u00baC with a heating rate of 10\u00baC/min. The results are presented on \nFigure 4. Before performing the analysis, the raw materials were dried at 105\u00baC. The \nweight loss exhibited by both materials, between 800\u00baC and 900\u00baC is related with the \ndecomposition of calcium carbonate. \nAlthough LM presents higher level of sodium than LSCP the chemical analysis confirms \nhow similar they are. The differences of other oxides contents are not relevant between \nthese materials and for the application. \nObserving Table 3, the average flow of production during the test with LM is not different \nfrom the conventional LWA production result (average from 8:00 to 12:00h). The density \nof LWAw seems to be slightly lower than LWAs (~5%) but negligible looking at the \nstandard deviation of 11 kg/m3. According to factory Y reports, the same variation happens \nin the conventional production process. \n \n\n  \nFig 4. TG/DTA analyses for LM and LSCP samples. \n\nTable 3.

Technically any drying process implicates energy consumption. In this specific \ncase, assuming the involved costs (see Table 2) provided by factory Y, the estimated total \ncosts for the drying and processing of the LM is around 10.17\u20ac/ton. Transportation costs \nare not included in this value, only investments in drying equipment, employee and energy \ncosts. The factory X would transport the LM waste to factory Y to warranty this estimated \ntotal cost. Assuming this as the implemented management solution, the benefits for factory \nY would be the saved costs with the conventional raw material (around 7.33\u20ac/ton). \nAssuming 89% of LSCP replacement level (Table 4) for LM and an amount of 2904 \nton/year in total used material, the factory Y could save approximately 21.000,00\u20ac/year as \nliquid benefit.  \n\nTable 4. Cost-benefits analysis of the solution according to factory Y. \n\n \n\nAccording to cost-benefits assessment estimated here for factory X, and considering the \nactual landfill tax estimated in 30\u20ac/ton of waste dry base, the savings would be in the order \nof 26.4\u20ac/ton of LM (194 ton of LM d.b.), more than 60.000\u20ac/year. But, in another \nperspective, if factory X assumes the transportation and drying costs related to the waste \nmanagement, instead of saving 26.4\u20ac/ton, the factory would save 16.24\u20ac/ton of LM [30\u20ac \n(LM landfilling) \u2013 3,6 ( LM transport) \u2013 10.17 (LM drying and processing) = 16.24). In \nthis situation, the total saving amount would be around 38.000\u20ac/year. \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\nThe high content of CaCO3 in LM makes this waste an interesting material to be used as \nmineral aggregate in this application.  The characterization results indicate that lime mud \nfrom pulp and paper mill represents a waste with similar chemical and physical properties \ncomparing with LSCP used in LWA production. Technically the industrial test with LM \nwas successfully performed. The industrial test showed that LM represents a potential \nmaterial for being used in LWA production as alternative raw material. According to the \nestimated values, factory X would avoid landfilling around 3.000 tons of LM a year. This \nfact, combined to saving costs and natural resources extraction saving permits to conclude \nthat this valorization solution is a viable one generating savings on both sides. \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThe authors would like to thank RAIZ, Portucel Soporcel group, ARGEX S.A. for their \nvaluable help and contribution in this work.

The \nashes were characterized considering particle size distribution, chemical composition, and \nwater leaching. \nCompared to the original sand bed, the bottom bed ashes have a wider distribution of \nparticle sizes; the inert material fed mixed with the biomass is responsible for this result. \nThe bottom bed ashes studied have distinct physical-chemical properties. \nThe treatment by water leaching and screening improves the quality of the ashes in order to \nallow its material valorization. After leaching, the concentration of some chemical \nelements in the ashes decreased in distinct percentages, depending on the chemical element \nand the origin of the ashes. The higher percentage of concentration decrease was observed \nfor Cl and S. \n\nKeywords: Ash, leaching, combustion, fluidized bed, biomass \n\nINTRODUCTION \nFluidized bed combustion (FBC) technology is recognized as the most appropriate \ntechnology for biomass combustion, due to the inherent advantages of low process \ntemperatures, isothermal operating conditions, and fuel flexibility. The existing FBC \ntechnology at industrial scale includes the bubbling fluidized bed combustors (BFBC) and \nthe circulating fluidized bed combustors (CFBC). Among other characteristics, these \ntechnologies differ in the pattern of gas-solid hydrodynamics in the reactor, the size of the \nbed particles, the heat and mass transfer rates in the reactor, the temperature and flue gas \ncomposition profile along the reactor. This in turns influences the characteristics of the \nashes produced during biomass combustion, and thus, flows of ashes with distinct \nproperties will be produced in these installations. \nDuring biomass combustion in BFBC two main types of ashes are produced: the bottom \nbed ashes and the fly ashes. The bottom bed ashes are composed by the sand particles from \nthe original (mainly quartz) sand bed, the inert material (forest soil and small stones) fed \ntogether with the biomass, and the biomass ash. The fly ashes are composed by the smaller \nsize particles from the original sand bed, particles resulting from attrition and abrasion of \nthe original sand bed particles, inert material fed with the biomass, and the biomass ash. In \nopposition to a grate furnace, where the bottom ashes represent the higher percentage of \nthe total ashes produced in the installation, during BFBC the bottom bed ashes often \nrepresent the lower fraction of the total ashes produced in the plant; the bottom bed ash \nfraction can be of the order 5%wt [1,2], 10%wt [3], 17%wt [4], or as high as 50%wt to \n60%wt as often observed in some Portuguese thermal plants with BFBC. \n\n\n\nAsh Utilisation 2012, Stockhom, SWEDEN \n\n \n\n \n\nThe bottom bed ashes during BFBC result from periodic discharges of the bed, among \nother reasons, related to: i) the need of bed renovation and replacement in order to avoid \nbed agglomeration and defluidization, ii) discharge of excess bed solids in order to \nmaintain bed height, iii) the replacement by fresh natural sand with appropriate particle \nsize distribution in order to guarantee proper hydrodynamic conditions of the bubbling bed. \nThe discharge of bottom bed ashes originates a significant amount of solid wastes to be \nmanaged. The ashes from biomass combustion in thermal plants are classified as a waste \naccording to the European List of Wastes [5], and the bottom bed ashes from BFBC are \nclassified with code 100124. Most of the published research work dealing with bottom bed \nashes from BFBC is related with the phenomena of bed agglomeration and defluidization, \nand less related with the environmental management and material valorization of the \nbottom bed ashes. \nThe phenomenon of bed agglomeration and defluidization is an issue of major concern \nduring BFBC. The reasons behind this phenomenon are associated with the formation of an \nash coating layer around the bed particles, and are related with the Na and K and their \ncombination with the Si, resulting in compounds with a relative lower melting point \npresent on those layers, achieved at the low temperatures of BBFC (800\u00baC to 900\u00baC), thus \npromoting the agglomeration of the particles and subsequent defluidization of the bed [6-\n20]. Nevertheless, in general, the bottom bed ash in a BFBC are composed mostly of silica \n(mostly quartz) sand particles, with particle size from the few micrometers until some \nmillimeters, often containing a relatively thin (with a few micrometers) coating layer \nmainly composed of inorganic material that is found in most of the typical biomass fuels \n[21]. \nIn this work are analyzed some physical-chemical properties of bottom bed ashes from \ncombustion a variety of forest biomass fuels in industrial BFBC existing in Portugal. Are \nalso evaluated some results of the physical-chemical treatment applied to the bottom bed \nashes from the BFBC, in order to produce a material that can be used in industrial \napplications, as for example, in substitution of natural silica sand. \n\nEXPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGY \nThe experimental work developed in this study is included in a wider research project [22] \naimed to study the characteristics of ashes produced in industrial thermal plants in \nPortugal, and to evaluate solutions for their management. The work includes the \ncharacterization of the ash flows in industrial thermal plants using biomass as fuel, the \ntreatment of the ashes considering is material valorization, and the environmental \nmanagement of the ashes. \nIn the study presented here are analyzed results about the characteristics of bottom bed \nashes sampled in some Portuguese industrial thermal plants with BFBC. The ashes were \ncharacterized for particle size distribution, chemical composition and leaching. \nIt was studied the raw bottom bed ash and the mass fraction of bottom bed ash with \nparticle size in the range 0.3 to 1.0 mm. The interest in this particle size fraction (0.3 to 1.0 \nmm) is related with the possibility of its recycling, namely to be utilized as: i) substitute of \npart of the natural sand used for bottom bed replacement in the BFBC, and ii) as aggregate \nin construction materials. \nFigure 1 shows the main flows of ashes in thermal plants with BFBC, and also the \nproposed bottom bed ash treatment and material valorization approach under evaluation. \n\nThermal Plant Characteristics \n\n\n\nAsh Utilisation 2012, Stockhom, SWEDEN \n\n \n\n \n\nThe bottom bed ashes studied were sampled in five BFBC, with nominal thermal capacity \nin the range 50 MWth to 100 MWth, using forest biomass residues as solid fuel. Among the \nbiomass fuels used, the eucalyptus bark and the residues from logging activities are the \nmajor component. The typical operating conditions of the industrial BFBC include \ntemperature of the bubbling bed in the range 800\u00baC to 900\u00baC, and O2 concentration in the \nflue gas in the range 4%v(dry gases) to 7%v(dry gases). \nThe ash samples were collected at the discharge location of the bottom bed ash in the \nindustrial BFBC plants. Each bottom bed ash sample had a mass of about 30 kg. \n\n \nFigure 1 \u2013 Schematic of the main flows of ashes in a thermal plant with BFBC, and bottom \n\nbed ash treatment for further material valorization. \n\n \n\nBottom Bed Ash Characterization \n\nThe bottom bed ashes samples collected were characterized for particle size distribution by \nsieving. For chemical characterization, it was selected the bottom bed ash fraction with \nparticle size in the range 0.3 to 1.0 mm from three BFBC installations, considering the \napplications to be studied, as stated before. The mass fraction of the bottom bed with \nparticle size in this range 0.3 to 1.0 mm can represent from 40%wt to 60%wt of the bottom \nbed ash discharged in the BFBC analyzed. It was also characterized the raw bottom bed \nashes (with particle size below 2 mm) from one industrial BFBC. The chemical \ncharacterization of the bottom bed ash was performed for major and minor chemical \nelements by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), using a Panalytical Axios spectrometer. Prior to \nanalysis, the bottom bed ash samples were subjected to a grinding process in an Agatha \nmill, followed by drying at 101 \u00baC \u00b1 1 \u00baC for 12 h. The chemical analysis was performed \nconsidering: i) Loss on ignition (LOI), and ii) XRF analysis on a pressed pellet previously \nprepared. For LOI determination, approximately 1.5 grams of the sample, milled and dried, \nwere heated to 1100 \u00baC for 3 hours in a Carbolite furnace; the LOI was obtained based on \nthe loss of weight after the heating at 1100 \u00baC. The pressed pellet for XRF analysis was \nprepared with about 10 grams of milled and dried ash sample. The ash sample was mixed \nwith 4 or 5 drops of polyvinyl alcohol and homogenized in a plastic recipient, and further \npressed in a standardized form. After drying the pressed pellet is then submitted to X-Ray \nanalysis. \nSome particles from the raw bottom bed ash of one BFBC and the respective particles \nresulting from its industrial leaching with water were prepared for further analysis of their \n\nSecondary air\n\nBiomass\n\nFresh sand\n\nCoarse (dp > 1.0 mm) bottom bed\n(to treatment, material valorization, or disposal)\n\nFine (dp &lt;0.3 mm) bottom bed ash\n(to treatment, material valorization, or disposal)\n\nBottom bed ash sieving\n\nFly ash\n\nFly ash\n(to treatment, material\n\nvalorization or disposal)\n\nFly ash\n\nPrimary air\n\nBottom bed ash\n\nBottom bed with intermediate particle\nsize (0.3 mm &lt;dp &lt;1.0 mm)\n\nElectrostactic\nprecipitator\n\nFly ash\n\nMaterial valorization in\nconstruction materials\n\nAdditional treatment\n\nAdditional treatment\n\nFly ash\n(to treatment, material\n\nvalorization or disposal)\n\n\n\nAsh Utilisation 2012, Stockhom, SWEDEN \n\n \n\n \n\ncross section by Scanning Electron Microscopy - Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-\nEDS), using an ultra-high resolution analytical scanning electron microscope HR-FESEM \nHitachi SU-70. \n\nBottom Bed Ash Leaching \n\nThe bottom bed ash leaching was evaluated using two procedures: i) water leaching in \nlaboratory, and ii) industrial water leaching. The leaching in laboratory was applied to \nthree bottom bed ashes with particle size in the range 0.3 to 1.0 mm. The industrial \nleaching was applied to the raw bottom bed ashes from one industrial BFBC. \nThe laboratorial leaching tests were performed according to the European Norm EN \n12457-2 [23]. Before leaching, the solid samples were pre-dried for 12 h at 105\u00baC \u00b1 5\u00baC. \nAccording to this procedure, 100 grams of dry bottom bed ash sample were transferred to a \npolypropylene stopper flask and then 1 L distilled water was added; that is, leaching with \nan L/S ratio (liquid to solid ratio) equal to 10 was used. It was a batch leaching test with \nduration of 24 hours under continuous stirring in an orbital shaker (250 rpm). \nThe industrial leaching was performed in continuous and under typical conditions used in \nan industry that makes treatment of natural sand for the construction industry. The leaching \nincludes a continuous shower like process using a L/S (liquid to solid) ratio equal to 2, and \na processing capacity of 10 ton/h; the process includes treatment of the leaching solution \nby sedimentation in order to reuse the liquid solution on the leaching process. \n\nRESULTS \n\nThe results presented here include: i) the particle size distribution of the original sand bed \nof the BFBC (OB_1, OB_4, OB_6), and the particle size distribution of the raw bottom bed \nashes (BA_1_R, BA_2_R, BA_4_R, BA_5_R, BA_6_R) from five industrial BFBC, ii) the \nchemical composition (determined by XRF) of the original natural sand bed (OB_4, \nOB_6), of the bottom bed particles with particle size in the range 0.3 to 1.0 mm before \n(BA_4, BA_5, BA_6) and after (BA_4_L, BA_5_L, BA_6_L) laboratorial leaching with \nwater, of a raw bottom bed ash (BA_6_R) and the respective bottom bed ash after \nindustrial leaching and screening (BA_6_IL). \nAfter industrial leaching and screening the material (BA_6_IL) to be valorized in industrial \napplications has the following particle size cumulative (lower) mass distribution: \n100%wt<2.0 mm, 94.9%wt<1.0, 18.9%wt<0.50 mm, 0.027%wt<0.25 mm, 0%wt<0.063 \nmm, and the chemical analysis by XRF was made on samples prepared from this particle \nsize distribution. \nIt is presented information about the SEM-EDS analysis of the cross section of some \nbottom bed ash particles before (BA_6_R) and after industrial leaching (BA_6_IL). \n\nBottom Bed Ash Characteristics \n\nFrom the macroscopic point of view, the bottom bed ashes from BFBC that use (mainly) \neucalyptus bark as biomass fuel are dark in color, whereas the bottom bed ash from BFBC \nthat use a variety of forest biomass residues (e.g., from logging activities) are brown in \ncolor. The bottom bed ashes from the BFBC analyzed showed no agglomerated particles. \nThe particle size distribution of the natural sand utilized as original bed and the bottom bed \nashes discharged is shown in Figure 2, for the industrial BFBC installations studied. It is \nobserved that the bottom bed ashes show a particle size distribution that is enriched with \nfine and coarse particles when compared with the original natural sand bed. Other studies \nin industrial BBFC [1,2,3,4] do not show this pattern characterized by a wide particle size \n\n\n\nAsh Utilisation 2012, Stockhom, SWEDEN \n\n \n\n \n\ndistribution. The enrichment in fine and coarse particles relative to the original sand bed, \nobserved in these Portuguese BFBC installations, can be explained by the quality of the \nforest biomass residues used as fuel. The biomass used can have considerable amounts of \ninert material (forest soil particles and small stones) as has been shown in a study \nconducted in a Portuguese industrial thermal plant using similar biomass fuel [24]; this \ncontamination of the biomass fuel by inert material results from bad practices during the \nbiomass residues collection and management before delivering to the BFBC installation. In \nfact, the increasing mass fraction of coarse particles in the bottom bed ashes observed here \nis not related with agglomeration phenomena, because no signs of agglomeration were \nobserved in the samples studied. \nFrom the operating perspective, there are some negative implications from the bottom bed \nenrichment in lower particle size material. For example, the lower particle size material fed \nwith the biomass is composed mostly of particles from the forest soil, and its lower \nterminal velocity enhances the entrainment along the freeboard and the corresponding \nerosion of the heat exchange equipment (e.g. super-heaters). The higher particle size \nmaterial is composed of coarse soil particles and small stones from the forest, that have \nmuch higher fluidization velocities than that of the particles from the original sand bed. \nThis enrichment in coarse particle size influences the quality of bed fluidization, affecting \nnegatively the heat and mass transfer inside the bed, and the whole performance of the \nBFBC. \nThe high level of inert material (soil and small stones from the forest) fed mixed with the \nbiomass in the Portuguese BFBC plants [24] implies a relatively high frequency of bottom \nbed discharge, and consequently these bottom bed ashes have low residence time (<3 days) \nin the BFBC when compared with other practices in industrial installations using BFBC \n[1,2]. \nThe composition of bottom bed ashes samples is shown in Figure 3, considering the loss on \nignition (LOI) and major chemical elements, and in Figure 4 considering some minor \nchemical elements. The characteristic low value of LOI reveals the low content of organic \nmatter in the bottom bed ashes, as it is usual in BFBC due to the relatively efficient \ncombustion inside the bed and the low solid carbon content inside the bed during the \ncombustion of high volatile matter content solid fuels as the biomass. For the bottom bed \nparticles BA_4 and BA_5, the unburned material determined at 550\u00baC [25] was found to be \nlower than 0.40%wt (dry basis) and 0.09%wt (dry basis), respectively. The major chemical \nelement present in the bottom bed ashes is Si; Oxygen not considered. The Si expressed as \nSiO2 represent about 74%wt, 72%wt, 83%wt and 85%wt of the bottom bed ashes with \nreference BA_6_R, BA_6, BA_4 and BA_5. This abundance of Si it is related with the \nnatural (mostly quartz) sand (>98.5%wt SiO2) used as original bottom bed in the BFBC. \nThe bottom bed ashes are enriched in chemical elements (Figures 3 and 4) that can be \nfound in the inorganic content of biomass [21], when compared to the original (quartz) \nsand bed. Considering the relatively high content of inert material (forest soil particles and \nsmall stones) fed mixed with the biomass [24], it is expected also that the bottom bed ash \ncomposition is influenced by the composition of that inert material. \n\n\n\nAsh Utilisation 2012, Stockhom, SWEDEN \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2 \u2013 Cumulative (lower) mass size distribution of particles from: original sand bed of \n\nplants 1 and 2 (OB_1), original sand bed of plants 4 and 5 (OB_4), original sand bed of \nplant 6 (OB_6), and raw bottom bed ashes from plants 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 (BA_1_R, BA_2_R, \n\nBA_4_R, BA_5_R, BA_6_R). \n\n \nFigure 3 \u2013 Chemical composition (LOI and major elements determined by XRF, except \nOxygen) of the original sand bed from three BFBC (OB_4=OB_5, OB_6), bottom bed \n\nashes (0.3 to 1.0 mm) from three BFBC (BA_4, BA_5, BA_6) and the respective bottom \nbed ashes after laboratory leaching (BA_4_L, BA_5_L, BA_6_L), raw bottom bed ashes \n\nfrom a BFBC (BA_6_R) and the respective bottom bed ashes after industrial leaching \n(BA_6_IL).

The coating \nlayer was measured as to have less than 50 \u00b5m thickness in particles with equivalent \ndiameter higher than 0.4 mm. Some of the chemical elements typical of the inorganic \ncontent of the biomass [21] were found in that coating layer in distinct amounts, namely \nthe Si, Ca, Mg, P, Na, Al, S. In Figure 6 it is presented the location and qualitative \nabundance of some of those chemical elements in that layer, namely the Ca, K, Mg and Na. \nThis enrichment in the outer layer of the bottom bed particles has been documented in the \nliterature and it is related with the bed agglomeration and defluidization phenomena \n[6,7,8,9,11,12,13]. The relative amount of some of these chemical elements, namely Si, Ca, \nK, Na and Al, and it relation to the melting temperatures of some inorganic compounds \npresent in that layer has been used to explain the agglomeration and defluidization \nphenomena during BFBC [6,7,17,18], and to develop measures for its prevention, as for \nexample the use of additives [7,14,16,17,18]. \n\nLeaching of Bottom Bed Ash \n\nWhen comparing the chemical composition of the bottom bed ash samples not leached \n(BA_4, BA_5, BA_6, and BA_6_R) and leached (BA_4_L, BA_5_L, BA_6_L, and \nBA_6_R_L) it is observed that the concentration of some chemical elements, among them \nthe Cl, S, Na and K, is lower in the leached samples (Figures 3 and 4); this result is \nimportant in the context of material valorization of the bottom bed ashes. It was calculated \nthe percentage of variation in the concentration of chemical elements present in the bottom \nbed ashes samples in result of leaching; for that purpose it was used the ratio between the \ndifference in concentration of (major) chemical elements in the samples not leached and in \nthe leached samples, and (relative to) their concentration in the samples not leached. That \npercentage of variation reflects a decrease in concentration of some chemical elements \npresent in the bottom bed ashes after leaching. The percentage of decrease in concentration \nof some chemical elements in the bottom bed ashes in result of leaching is shown in Figure \n7. This decrease in concentration can also be regarded as an indicator of the chemical \nelements removal in result of leaching. It is observed that the percentage of decrease in \nconcentration is different for the distinct bottom bed ashes studied. In general, the \npercentage of decrease in concentration of (major) chemical elements in the bottom bed \nashes with reference BA_6_L is higher than that observed for the bottom bed ashes \nBA_4_L and BA_5_L.  \nAs well, differences in the percentage of decrease in concentration of some chemical \nelements between the laboratorial (BA_6_L) and industrial (BA_6_IL) leaching of bottom \nbed ashes were observed; the industrial leaching shows higher percentages of decrease in \nconcentration, except for Na and K. However, it is important to refer that the laboratorial \nand industrial leaching procedures had differences on: i) the particle size distribution of the \nbottom bed ashes leached, ii) the L/S ratio, iii) the pattern of solid-liquid contact, and iv) \nthe leaching time. \nThe chemical elements removal by leaching is influenced by the form according which the \nelements are bonded in the ashes, including the coating layer around the sand bed particles, \nand by the physical-chemical properties of the leaching solution, among them, the pH \n[26,27,28]. Distinct chemical compounds have distinct solubility. \nThe chemical (major) elements that show higher percentage of decrease in concentration \nare the Cl and S (Figure 7), despite these elements are present in low concentration \n\n\n\nAsh Utilisation 2012, Stockhom, SWEDEN \n\n \n\n \n\n(<0.25%wt) in the bottom bed ashes. A concentration decrease in the range 20% to 80% is \nobserved for S, and in the range 40% to 80% for Cl. The presence of these chemical \nelements bound in soluble salts in the bottom bed ashes can explain the high removal level \nby leaching [26]. \n \n \n\n  \n\n \nFigure 5 \u2013 Microscopic view of cross section of bed particles: original sand bed (OB_6), \n\nraw bottom bed (sand) particle (BA_6_R), bottom bed (sand) particle after industrial water \nleaching (BA_6_IL). \n\n \nThe decrease in concentration of other (major) chemical elements important considering \nthe material valorization of the bottom bed ashes, as for example the Na and K, was \nrelatively low (<7%wt) for the samples BA_4_L and BA_5_L, and in the range 20% to \n50% for BA_6_L and BA_6_IL, respectively. The samples resulting from laboratorial \nleaching showed a higher percentage of decrease in concentration of Na and K when \ncompared with the industrial leaching; when analyzing the laboratorial and industrial \nleaching it is important to refer that the experimental conditions are distinct. \n \n \n\n   \n\n   \n\nCa Ca \n\nK K \n\nOB_6 BA_6_R \n\nBA_6_IL \n\n\n\nAsh Utilisation 2012, Stockhom, SWEDEN \n\n \n\n \n\ncontinue \n\n   \n\n   \nBA_6_R   BA_6_IL \n\nFigure 6 \u2013 Composition (Ca, K, Mg, Na) of the coating layer of a bed particle determined \nby SEM-EDS: bottom bed particle (BA_6_R), bottom bed particle after industrial leaching \n\n(BA_6_IL). \n\nThe relatively low percentage of decrease in concentration of K and Na could be related \nwith the fact that those compounds are not present mainly in the form of soluble salts, like \nthe KCl or K2SO4 [26], but instead should be present as compounds with low solubility as \nfor example the sodium and potassium feldspars [26], also with origin in the inert material \n(forest soil) fed mixed with the biomass. To a better understanding of this process there is \nongoing work dealing with Energy-Dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis of the \nbottom bed ashes. \nThe concentration of Mg, P and Ti in the leached sample BA_4_L was higher than in the \nnon-leached sample BA_4 (Figure 3). Among other reasons, the relative lower leachability \nof these chemical elements in comparison to the other chemical elements present in the \nbottom bed ashes can explain this result; thus, after leaching the sample become enriched \nin these elements. Considering that sample replicates were used in chemical \ncharacterization, before and after leaching, the representativeness of the replicates is \nanother issue to be considered. This subject has to be confirmed with further experiments. \nThe higher concentration of Si in all the leached samples, relative to the non-leached \nsamples, is justified by the lower leachability of this chemical element relative to the other \nchemical elements present; thus, after leaching the sample become enriched in this \nelement. \nIt was observed that the coating layer around the bottom bed sand particles it is not \nremoved by water leaching, as shown in Figure 5 and 6; nevertheless, by SEM it was \nobserved that the particles show a coating layer with lower thickness after leaching, as \nshown in the example of Figure 5 for a particle resulting from industrial leaching. \n \n\nMg \n\nNa \n\nMg \n\nNa \n\n\n\nAsh Utilisation 2012, Stockhom, SWEDEN \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 7 \u2013 Percentage of decrease in concentration of (major) chemical elements in the \n\nbottom bed ashes in result of leaching.

The laboratorial leaching solutions had pH \nvalues in the range 11.5 to 13.0, with the higher value observed in the solution from \nleaching BA_6 (sample BA_6_L in Figure 8). The pH value of the solution from the \nindustrial leaching has a lower value (pH=9.5) than those observed in the laboratorial \nleaching solutions. The high pH values are related to the alkaline characteristics of the \nashes, and results from its content in alkali chemical elements, as for example the Na, K, \nCa, that become dissolved in the leaching solutions. High values of pH are common of \nbottom bed ashes from industrial BFBC using biomass as fuel [3,4]. \n\n \nFigure 8 \u2013 pH and conductivity of the leaching solutions.

The conductivity is \nrelated with the concentration of dissolved ions, among those, the ions derived from alkali \nelements like Na, K, Ca, and also ions derived from Cl and S. High conductivity reveals \nhigh ionic strength of the solution and this is associated with high concentration of ions, \nand reflects a higher removal of alkali elements, chlorine and sulphur from the bottom bed \nashes. In the laboratorial leaching experiments, the higher values of pH and conductivity \nwhere observed for the solutions from leaching bottom bed ashes from the two BFBC \nusing mainly eucalyptus bark (samples BA_4_L and BA_6_L in Figure 8). For the bottom \nbed ashes from the BFBC that uses forest residues from several forest management \nactivities a relatively lower value of conductivity was observed (sample with reference \nBA_5_L in Figure 8).  \nWhen analysing the values of pH and conductivity of the solution from industrial leaching \nwith those from laboratorial leaching, BA_6_L and BA_6_IL, it is important to remember \nthat are distinct leaching procedures, as described previously. \n\nCONCLUSIONS \nIn this work, bottom bed ashes from combustion of forest biomass residues in industrial \nBFBC where studied. The bottom bed ashes were characterized considering particle size \ndistribution, chemical composition, and water leaching. \nCompared to the original sand bed, the bottom bed ashes have a wider distribution of \nparticle sizes. The inert material fed mixed with the biomass has a major role in this \nprocess. In this context, the quality of the forest biomass residues used as fuel has to be \nimproved, namely by removing the inert material (forest soil and small stones) that arrives \nto the thermal plant mixed with the biomass. \nIt was observed that the treatment by screening and water leaching can improve the quality \nof the bottom bed ashes in order to allow its material valorization in some industrial \napplications, namely as substitute of natural sand, thus saving natural resources. \nAfter the leaching process the concentration of some chemical elements in the bottom bed \nashes decreased in distinct percentages, depending on the chemical element and the origin \nof the ashes. The higher percentage of concentration decrease was observed for Cl and S. \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nThis work was financially supported by Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia, \nPortugal, through the project with reference PTDC/AAC-AMB/098112/2008 (Bias-to-soil \n- Biomass ash: Characteristics in relation to its origin, treatment and application to soil). \n\nREFERENCES \n[1] Latva-Somppi J, Moisio M, Kauppinen EI, Valmari T, Ahonen P, Tapper U, \n\nKeskinen J.

Bottom bed ashes differ significantly from fly \nashes, in concern of both physical characteristics and chemical composition. It was observed a \nmodification in some physical-chemical characteristics of the ashes in result of their exposition to \natmospheric air. The pH of the distinct ash samples was alkaline, with values in range 10.3 to 12.7. The \nconductivity of the ashes varied in the range 0.9 to 19.3 mS/cm, with the fresh fly ashes from the \nelectrostatic precipitator showing the higher value. During the atmospheric air exposition, a decrease in \npH and conductivity of the ash leaching solutions was observed. Calcium was the water soluble element \nwith higher concentration in the leaching solution. Due to ash exposition to atmospheric air, a decrease on \nthe leaching of Ca and an increase on the Cl and Al from the fly ashes from the electrostatic precipitator \nwas observed. The process of ash-atmospheric air interaction is of major importance considering the \ncharacterization of the ashes and their environmental management. \nKeywords: Biomass, Combustion, Fluidized bed, Ashes. \n \n\n1 INTRODUCTION \n \nEnergy resources are essential in the economy, sustainable development and in generation of prosperity for \n\nall countries [1, 2]. In the European Union, the utilization of renewable sources has been increased, with the \nmain goals of: diversify the energy supply, reducing the dependence on fossil fuel markets and reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions [3]. For that, it was created some directives, which require national targets and \nstrategies for the development of renewable energy sources and establish sustainable criteria for biomass sources \n[4]. \n\nBiomass is a resource always associated with environmental sustainability and climate stabilization, with \nlarge potential, economic viability and social and environmental benefits [2, 5, 6]. So, its use has being \nincreasing during the last years and makes part of the energy strategies for several countries [5]. There are \nvarious sources of biomass that can be use as a fuel, some of them can be taken directly from the forest, which \ninclude residues from plantations, logging residues from forest management activities and extraction of wood, \nseveral agricultural residues, animal wastes, and other fuels derived from biological sources (e.g. sludge) [2, 5, \n6]. \n\nBiomass is also an important source of energy for many industries in many countries [2]. Combustion is the \nmain technology for thermochemical conversion of biomass to power or/and heat at industrial level. The \nselection and design of combustion systems is determined by the environmental legislation, the characteristics of \nthe fuel, the operational costs, performance of the system and the energy needs [7]. Nowadays, fluidized bed \n(FB) technology is recognize as the most appropriate for biomass combustion, due to the inherent advantages \nsuch as: low process temperatures, isothermal operating conditions and fuel flexibility. Two types of FB exist at \nindustrial scale, the bubbling fluidized bed combustors and the circulating fluidized bed combustors. These \ntechnologies differ in the size of the bed particles, in the pattern of gas-solid hydrodynamics in the reactor, the \nheat and mass transfer rates in the reactor and the temperature and flue gas composition profile along the reactor \n[7-9]. \n\nIn Portugal, several industrial sectors are intensive consumers of forest biomass, and in some of them heat \nor/and power are produced using this resources in combustion process. Some of these biomass resources are \nresidues/sub-products from industrial related activities as the preparation of feedstock and operations of forest \nmaintenance. On the other hand, Portuguese government established the renewable energy resources as priorities \nfor energy strategy, and biomass is among these resources. \n\nSeveral operating and environmental problems are recognized during biomass combustion in fluidized beds. \nThe operating problems are mainly related to bed agglomeration and defluidization, which can lead to costly and \nunscheduled shutdown of the combustors [10-12]. Among the environmental problems, those related to the ashes \nproduced and its environmental management are of major concern [13, 14]. In this context, it is important to \nknow in detail the physical-chemical characteristics of the ashes and how their physical-chemical properties \nchange with time when exposed to environment conditions. \n\nImportant physical-chemical properties of the ash include particle size distribution, density and porosity, \nspecific surface area, pH, leaching, chemical composition, and mineralogy [8]. During fluidized bed combustion \n\n\n\n21th European Biomass Conference and Exhibition 2013, Copenhagen, Denmark \n\n \n\ntwo main flows of ashes can be identified and classified [7, 15]: bottom ashes and fly ashes. The fly ashes can be \ncollected in super-heaters, economizers and air pollution control devices (cyclones, bag filters and electrostatic \nprecipitators). Often, in thermal plants the distinct fly ash flows are mixed and managed together, although it is \nrecognized that each ash flow has distinct characteristics [7, 8, 17, 16-28]. \n\nThe ashes from biomass combustion are very alkaline [8, 9, 23, 25, 29] and reactive, and some modifications \nin their physical-chemical characteristics can occur, as for example carbonation [14, 30], when they are exposed \nto environmental conditions. This behavior has to be taken in consideration when studying ash management \noptions, and it is also important in the context of developing appropriate characterization methodologies for the \nashes; for example, the storage conditions applied to the ash samples prior to physical-chemical analysis can \ninfluence the results. \n\nAsh disposal in landfill has been used worldwide. However, the increasing costs and unsustainability of this \nmanagement practice has been driving efforts in order to develop appropriate management practices for the \nashes, e.g. the recycling of ashes to forest soil [28, 29, 31-33], and the incorporation in construction materials \n[34, 35], thus saving other natural resources often used in those applications. \n\nIn this work it was made the characterization of distinct ash flows (bottom ashes and fly ashes (superheater, \neconomizer and electrostatic precipitator)) from a biomass thermal power plant using a bubbling fluidised bed \ncombustor (BFBC). The ash samples were exposed to atmospheric conditions inside a laboratory during six \nmonths, aiming to study the modification on the ash properties with time of atmospheric air exposure. This study \nis part of an integrated research project [36] in which characteristics of ashes from Portuguese thermal plants \nhave been studied together with some alternatives of material valorization, in order to establish guidelines to a \nproper ash management. \n\n \n \n\n2 EXPERIMENTAL WORK \n \n\nThe ashes analyzed in this study were collected in a Portuguese thermal power plant with BFBC (50 MWth). \nThe thermal plant use forest biomass residues (FBR) as fuel, mostly resulting from activities related to \neucalyptus and pinus stands exploitation for wood to several other industrial sectors. The ashes were sample \nfrom the bottom bed (BA), superheater (FA_SH), economizer (FA_EC) and electrostatic precipitator (stage 1 \n(FA_ESP1) and stage 2 (FA_ESP2)). \n\nThe layout of the industrial thermal power plant is shown in Fig. 1, together with the respective indication of \nlocation of ash samples collection point. \n\nThe ash samples collected were exposed to atmospheric air conditions inside a laboratory during six months. \nThe laboratory conditions of temperature and moisture were monitored (Fig. 2). Physical-chemical \ncharacterization of the ashes was done at distinct time periods: (i) fresh samples, (ii) after 1 week, (iii) after 1 \nmonth, (iv) after 3 months (only for bottom bed ashes) and (v) after 6 months.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2: Air temperature and relative humidity inside the laboratory during the period of the study. \n\n \n2.1 Methodology of ash analysis \n\nThe ashes were characterized for some physical-chemical parameters: particle size distribution, chemical \ncomposition, mineralogy, and leaching characteristics (pH, conductivity and water soluble elements). \n\nThe particle size distribution was analyzed using two methodologies: i) sieving analysis, using ASTM sieves \nand ii) Coulter analysis \u2013 LS230 (for size particles below 2 mm). \n\nDays\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180\n\nR\ne\nla\n\ntiv\ne\n\n h\num\n\nid\nity\n\n (\n%\n\n),\n T\n\ne\nm\n\np\ne\n\nra\ntu\n\nre\n (\n\u00baC\n\n)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nRelative humidity \nTemperature \n\n\n\n21th European Biomass Conference and Exhibition 2013, Copenhagen, Denmark \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1: Schematic representation of the industrial thermal power plant with BFBC. \n\nThe chemical composition of the ashes was determined by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) using a Panalytical \nAxios spectrometer. Prior to analysis, the ash samples were subjected to a grinding process in an Agatha mill. \nThe analysis was performed considering: i) Loss on ignition (LOI) and ii) XRF analysis on a pressed pellet \npreviously prepared. For LOI determination, approximately 1.5 grams of the sample milled were dried, and \nheated to 1100\u00baC for 3 hours in a Carbolite furnace. The LOI was obtained based on the loss of weight after the \nheating at 1100\u00baC. A pressed pellet for XRF analysis was prepared with proximately 10 grams of milled and \ndried ash sample. The ash sample was mixed with 4 or 5 drops of polyvinyl alcohol and homogenized in a plastic \nrecipient, and further pressed in a standardized form. After drying, the pressed pellet was analyzed by XRF. \n\nThe mineralogy composition of the ashes was determined by X-Ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku \nGeigerflex diffractometer D/max-Series, power 40kV/30mA, scan mode continuous/speed \u2013 3\u00ba/min). \n\nThe water leaching was performed according the European Norm EN 12457-2 [37]. The pH and the \nconductivity of solutions were measured after 24h leaching. The chemical analysis of the leaching solutions was \nperformed using Flame Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (FAAS) (for Ca, Mg, Na, K, Fe), Inductively Coupled \nPlasma - Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) (for As, Cd, Mn, Pb, Mo, Ni), Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic \nEmission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) (for Al, Zn, Ba, B, Cr, Sr, Cu, P), and Chloride-selective Ion Electrode \nmethod for Cl (analyzed as chloride (Cl-)). \n\n \n3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n \nThe particle size distribution (mass distribution) of the bottom bed ashes and fly ashes determined by sieving \n\nis shown in Fig. 3. It is observed that the bottom bed ash shows a particle size distribution enriched in coarse \nparticles when compared to the fly ashes. A decreased in the particle size from bottom bed ash to the \nelectrostatic precipitator ashes (FA_ESP1 and FA_ESP2) it is observed. \n\nThe average particle size (volume basis), determined by Coulter analysis (Figure 4) shows the same pattern \nas that observed by sieving. It is important to state that for this analysis only the bottom ash particles below 2m \nwere considered. The FBR used as fuel in Portugal in thermal plants has considerable amounts of inert material, \nsuch as soil particles and small stones [25], and that influences the physical-characteristics of the ashes produced \nin the thermal plant. The chemical composition of ashes is shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, for LOI, and major and \nminor chemical elements. It is observed a clear difference between the composition of BA, FA_SH, FA_EC, and \nthe FA_ESP1 and FA_ESP2. The LOI is below 0.5%wt (dry basis) for the BA, and for fly ashes the LOI \nincreases from FA_SH and FA-EC (below 1%wt, dry basis) to FA_ESP1 and FA_ESP2. \n\n \n \n\nSecondary air\n\nBiomass\n\nFresh sand\n\nPrimary air\n\nElectrostactic\nprecipitator\n\nFly ash\n\nBottom bed ash\n(BA)\n\nFly  ash\n(ESP1)\n\nFly ash\n(ESP2)\n\nFly  ash\n(EC)\n\nFly  ash\n(SH)\n\nTerceary air\n\nE\nco\n\nn\no\nm\n\nis\ne\n\nr\n\nFluidised bed\n\nS\nu\np\ne\n\nr \nh\n\ne\na\nte\n\nr\n\nC\nh\nim\n\nn\ne\n\ny\n\nFan\n\nA\nir\n p\n\nre\n-h\n\ne\na\nte\n\nr\n\nFlue gas\n\n\n\n21th European Biomass Conference and Exhibition 2013, Copenhagen, Denmark \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3: Particle size distribution (mass basis), determined by sieving for the bottom and fly ashes.

Legend \naccording locations in the plant as shown in Fig. 1. For the BA sample it was selected the fraction with particle \n\nsize below 2000\u00b5 m. \n \n\nThe unburned content of ashes (determined at 550\u00baC, procedure adpated from standard CEN/TS 14775:2004 \n[39]) revealed a loss on weight lower than 0.1%wt for BA, below 0.5%wt for FA_SH and FA_EC and below \n1.5%wt for FA_ESP1 and FA_ESP2. These show that the amount of organic content present in the ashes is \nrelatively low, which confirm a high efficiency of fuel conversion in the furnace. The increase in unburned \nmaterial content from BA to FA_ESP2 is explained in result of the fact that the high temperature of bottom bed \nallows a high conversion of the fuel, and the low particle size and density of some fuel particles under \ncombustion are transported with the fuel gases through the furnace and collected at the air pollution control \nequipment (electrostatic precipitator). The higher values of LOI determined at 1100\u00baC compared with the \nunburned material content determined at 550\u00baC show the contribution of thermal decomposition and \nvolatilization of other components than unburned fuel (organic material) in the ashes. \n\n \n\nParticle size (\u00b5m)\n\n<180 180-250 250-360 360-500 500-710 710-1000 1000-1400 1400-2000 2000-2800 2800-4000 4000-4750 >4750\n\n%\nw\n\nt\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n20.0\n\n40.0\n\n60.0\n\n80.0\n\nBA\nFA_SH\nFA_EC \nFA_ESP1 \nFA_ESP2 \n\nParticle size (\u00b5m)\n\n0.01 0.1 1 10 100 1000 10000\n\n%\n V\n\no\nlu\n\nm\ne\n\n (\nd\n\niff\ne\nre\n\nn\nc\nia\n\nl)\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nBA\nFA_SH\nFA_EC\nFA_ESP1 \nFA_ESP2 \n\n\n\n21th European Biomass Conference and Exhibition 2013, Copenhagen, Denmark \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5: Major chemical elements in the ash samples collected at distinct locations along the thermal plant, \n\nvalues expressed in %wt (dry basis (db)). Legend according to locations in the plant as shown in Fig. 1. \n\nBottom ash and fly ashes from superheater and economizer are enriched in Si when compared to fly ashes \nfrom electrostatic precipitator (Fig. 5); this result is also verified by mineralogy analysis (Fig. 7). The mineralogy \nanalysis shows a higher intensity of Si in these ashes, present mainly as quartz (SiO2). The high content of Si in \nthe bottom ash is explained by the original bed material used (sand with more than 98.5%wt, dry basis of SiO2) \nand the inert material (forest soil an stones) fed mixed with the FBR used as fuel. \n\nFly ashes from electrostatic precipitator also show Si as the chemical element with higher concentration. \nHowever, it is observed enrichment in other chemical elements typical of the inorganic content of the biomass, \nsuch as: Na, Mg, Al, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti and Fe when compared with the other ash flows. The contribution of fine \nparticles carried out with the combustion flue gases, which include the chemical elements typical of the \ninorganic content of biomass [40, 41] can explained this result. The second more abundant chemical element \npresent in the FA_ESP1 and FA_ESP2 ashes is Ca. Cl and S are present in higher concentrations in the \nFA_ESP1 and FA_ESP2 when compared to bottom ashes, and this result can be explained by the higher \ncontribution from the inorganic content of the biomass to the fly ashes. Also, the physical-chemical \ncharacteristics of FA_ESP1 and FA_ESP2, manly the high calcium content (Fig. 5), allows the adsorption of \nsome gas phase chlorine and sulfur released (HCL and SO2) during the combustion of biomass. \n\n \nFigure 6: Minor chemical elements in the ash samples collected at distinct locations along the thermal plant, \n\nvalues expressed in ppm (weight (wt), dry basis (db)).

In bottom ash (BA), the main component \nis quartz, which is in agreement with the X-Ray Fluorescence results and with the characteristics of the original \nsand bed [25], and small amounts of potassium feldspars (microcline) are present, and this can be explained as \nresulting from the inert material (forest soil) fed with biomass and with the existence of those crystalline phases \nin the biomass ash [40, 42]. In the distinct fresh fly ashes, quartz is the most abundant crystalline phase; \nhowever, its abundance decreases from FA_SH to the FA_ESP2. Fly ashes from electrostatic precipitator present \nother crystalline phases (Fig. 7) typical from the biomass ash [40, 42], with different abundance. \n\nAn important characteristic of ashes from biomass combustion biomass is their high concentration in plant \nnutrients [24]. The water leaching of ash works as an indicator of the soluble chemical elements that can be \nreleased from ash to the soil. \n\nWater leaching depends on the characteristics of ashes, and also on the reactions that can occur during the \nprocess. In this context, the fresh ashes and air exposed ashes can behave in a distinct way. Some ashes have \ncementious characteristics in presence of moderate amounts of water; some hydrated minerals (ettringite, \nportlandite and calcite) and calcium silicates, aluminate-hydrates and gypsum could be formed during the \nprocess [14]. The formation of these new phases in the ashes affects the solubility and leaching of chemical \nelements present in the ashes. \n\nThe XRD results show that some modifications occur in the ash material in result of air exposition. Those \nmodifications are mainly observed in the fly ashes (Fig. 7); the increase in the amount of calcite observed in the \nfly ashes after 6-moths air exposition (6m) is an evident modification. Portlandite (Ca(OH)2) is formed by \nhydration of CaO present in fresh ashes, as a result of interaction o air moisture with the CaO, and then reacts \nwith the CO2 presents in the atmospheric air and produces calcite [14, 30] according to reaction 1: \n\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) OHcrCaCOaqCOaqOHCacrOHCa 23222)( +?+?  (1 \n \nThe formation of calcium carbonate (calcite) is one of most important phenomena related to the self-\n\nhardening process of biomass ash [14, 43]. \nThe pH, conductivity and release of chemical elements upon water leaching are given in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. \n\nThese characteristics were evaluated along distinct time periods of exposition of the ashes to atmospheric air. \n \n\n \nFigure 8: pH of the leaching solution; leaching according standard EN 12457-2 [37]. The pH of the leaching \n\nsolutions was measured at a temperature of 23.0\u00b12.2\u00baC. X-axis titles according to ash sampling locations in the \nthermal plant as shown in Fig. 1. Legend: fs-fresh sample, 1w-one week of air exposition, 1m- one month of air \n\nexposition, 3m- three months of air exposition (only for bottom ash), 6m-six month of air exposition. \n \nThe water leaching (standard EN 12457-2 [37]) of fresh ash samples originates alkaline solutions, with pH in \n\nthe range 12 a 12.7. The pH increases from the bottom ash to the fly ash from electrostatic precipitator (Fig. 8), \nand this can be explained as related with the chemical composition of the ashes, namely the higher alkali content \nof the ashes from electrostatic precipitator (Fig. 5). \n\nThe conductivity of fresh ash samples varies in the range 5 to 19 mS/cm (Fig. 9), and increases from the BA \nto the FA_ESP2 ashes. The conductivity is related with the concentration of dissolved ions, among those, the \nions derived from alkali elements like Na, K, Ca, and also ions derived from Cl and S. Higher conductivity \nreveals higher ionic strength of the solution and this is associated with higher concentration of ions, thus \nreflecting a higher solubility of alkali elements, chlorine and sulphur from the fly ashes, when compared to the \nobserved for FA_BA, FA_SH and FA_EC. \n\nIn general, it was observed that pH and conductivity of the ash leaching solutions decreased with the time of \nair exposition of ashes; that decrease is higher in the case of FA_ESP1 and FA_ESP2, and this result could be \n\nBA FA_SH FA_EC FA_ESP1 FA_ESP2\n\np\nH\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\nf s \n1 w  \n1 m \n3 m \n6 m \n\n\n\n21th European Biomass Conference and Exhibition 2013, Copenhagen, Denmark \n\n \n\nrelated with the formation of new crystalline phases (Fig. 7), e.g. as calcium carbonate, which reduces the \nsolubility of some chemical elements present in the ashes [14]. \n\n \n\n \n \nFigure 8: Conductivity of the leaching solution; leaching according standard EN 12457-2 [37].

Calcium is the \n\nelement present in higher concentration in the leaching solution of fresh ash samples. Leaching solutions of \nFA_ESP1 and FA_ESP2 show the higher concentration of calcium and potassium, and this can be explained by \nthe fact that these two ashes present a higher concentration of calcium and potassium (Fig. 5). \n\nIn general, in result of exposition of the ashes to atmospheric air it is observed a decreased in the \nconcentration of calcium in all leaching solutions. This can be caused by the decrease of solubility of calcium \ncompounds, due to the formation of compounds as calcite, which are less soluble than other Ca-based \ncompounds as CaO. On the other hand, it is observed a significant increase in concentration of chlorine \n(determined as Cl-) in the leaching solution of FA_ESP1 and FA_ESP2 exposed to air during a period of six \nmonths; although observed also for the other ash fractions after six month of exposition, the effect is less \npronounced that that observed for FA_ESP1 and FA_ESP2. This can only be explained in result of modifications \non the forms according which chlorine is bounded in the ashes, thus becoming more soluble with time. \n\nThe concentration of aluminum in the leaching solution of fresh ash sample of bottom ash is significant \nhigher than in the leaching solutions of fly ashes, although this chemical element is present in higher \nconcentration in the fly ashes (Fig. 5); the reasons behind this behavior can be the more or less soluble forms \naccording which this element is bound in the ashes. \n\nThe minor chemical elements present in the leaching solutions are shown in Fig. 9. Among those, Ba and Sr \nare the elements present in higher concentration in the leaching solution of fresh ash samples. Barium varied \nbetween 1.8 mg/kg of ash in the FA_ESP2 and 6 mg/kg of ash in the FA_EC leaching solution. The \nconcentration of Sr in the leaching solutions varied in a range of 3.4 to 41.8 mg/kg of ash, being the FA_ESP2 \nleaching solution which presented the highest concentration. \n\nDuring air exposition of ashes the concentration of Zn, Ba and Sr decreased, mainly for the case of FA_ESP1 \nand FA_ESP2. On the other hand, the concentration of B in the leaching solutions of BA, FA_ESP1 and \nFA_ESP2 increase during the air exposition (Fig.9).  \n\nSome elements, such as As (0.02-0.03 mg/kg of ash) and Cd (3.4x10-4-1.8x10-3 mg/kg of ash) only were \nmeasured in leaching solution of fly ashes from electrostatic precipitator, and their concentration did not change \nduring air exposition. The presence of those elements only in these ashes can be explained by the fact that the \nFA_ESP1 and FA_ESP2 present a higher concentration (6) of minor chemical elements than BA, FA_SH and \nFA_EC.  \n\n \n \n\nBA FA_SH FA_EC FA_ESP1 FA_ESP2\n\nC\no\n\nnd\nuc\n\ntiv\nity\n\n (\nm\n\nS\n/c\n\nm\n)\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\nf s \n1 w  \n1 m \n3 m \n6 m \n\n\n\n21th European Biomass Conference and Exhibition 2013, Copenhagen, Denmark \n\n \n\n  \n\n(a) (b) \n\n  \n\n(c) (d) \n\n \n\n(e) \nFigure 9: Major chemical elements present in the leaching solutions from ash samples collected at distinct \n\nlocations along the thermal plant ((a) Bottom ash (BA), (b) Fly ash from superheater (FA_SH), (c) Fly ash from \neconomizer (FA_EC), Fly ash from electrostatic precipitator stage one (d) and stage two (e) (FA_ESP1 and \n\nFA_ESP2)), for fresh ash samples and ash samples after distinct time periods of exposition to atmospheric air. \n\n \n\nfresh sample 1 week 1 month 3 months 6 months\n\nm\ng\n\n/ k\ng\n\n a\nsh\n\n (\nd\n\nry\n b\n\na\nsi\n\ns)\n\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n\n2000.0\n\n4000.0\n\n6000.0\n\nCa \nMg \nNa \nK \nCl \nA l \nFe \n\nfresh sample 1 week 1 month 3 months 6 months\n\nm\ng\n\n/ k\ng\n\n a\nsh\n\n (\nd\n\nry\n b\n\na\nsi\n\ns)\n\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n\n2000.0\n\n4000.0\n\n6000.0\n\nCa \nMg \nNa \nK \nCl \nAl \nFe \n\nfresh sample 1 week 1 month 6 months\n\nm\ng\n\n/ k\ng\n\n a\nsh\n\n (\nd\n\nry\n b\n\na\nsi\n\ns)\n\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n\n2000.0\n\n4000.0\n\n6000.0\n\nCa \nMg \nNa \nK \nCl \nAl \nFe \n\nfresh sample 1 week 1 month 6 months\n\nm\ng\n\n/ k\ng\n\n a\nsh\n\n (\nd\n\nry\n b\n\na\nsi\n\ns)\n\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n\n2000.0\n\n4000.0\n\n6000.0\n\n8000.0\n\n10000.0\n\n12000.0\n\nCa \nMg \nNa \nK \nCl \nAl \nFe \n\nfresh sample 1 week 1 month 6 months\n\nm\ng\n\n/ k\ng\n\n a\nsh\n\n (\nd\n\nry\n b\n\na\nsi\n\ns)\n\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n\n2000.0\n\n4000.0\n\n6000.0\n\n8000.0\n\n10000.0\n\n12000.0\n\nCa \nMg \nNa \nK \nCl \nAl \nFe \n\n\n\n21th European Biomass Conference and Exhibition 2013, Copenhagen, Denmark \n\n \n\n  \n\n(a) (b) \n\n  \n\n(c) (d) \n\n \n(e) \n\nFigure 9: Minor chemical elements present in the leaching solution from ash samples collected at distinct \nlocations along the thermal plant ((a) Bottom ash (BA), (b) Fly ash from superheater (FA_SH), (c) Fly ash from \n\neconomizer (FA_EC), (d) Fly ash from electrostatic precipitator stage one (FA_ESP1), and (e) Fly ash from \nelectrostatic precipitator stage two (FA_ESP2)), for fresh ash samples and ash samples after distinct time periods \n\nof exposition to atmospheric air. \n \n4 CONCLUSIONS \n\nDifferent ash flows from a biomass thermal power plant were collected and exposed to atmospheric \nconditions under laboratory conditions during six months. Some physical and chemical characteristics of the ash \nflows were analyzed. Bottom ash shows particle size distribution enriched in coarse particles when compared \nwith fly ashes. This result is mainly due to the biomass used as fuel, because this it has considerable amounts of \ninert material, such as soil particles and small stones. An important difference between the chemical composition \nof distinct ash flows was observed. The LOI increases from bottom bed ashes to fly ashes from electrostatic \nprecipitator.

Enrichment in compounds of silicon was observed for bottom ash, fly ash from \nsuperheater and economizer. The high content of silicon in the ashes is explained by the original material used as \nbed and by the inert material feed with the biomass that is dragged with the combustion flue gases.  \n\nFly ashes from electrostatic precipitator show the silicon as the chemical element with the higher \nconcentration, followed by calcium. However, enrichment in elements such as sodium, magnesium, calcium and \npotassium was observed. This result is related to the contribution of fine particles constituted by chemical \nelements of the inorganic content of biomass, which were carried out with the combustion flue gases. The \nconcentration of minor chemical elements increased from bottom ash to fly ash from electrostatic precipitator. \nBarium was the minor chemical element with higher concentration in ashes. The abundance of these elements in \nthe fly ash from electrostatic precipitator is due to the contribution of inorganic content of biomass released \nduring the combustion. As a result of the atmospheric air exposition, a modification in the mineralogy of ashes \nwas observed, mainly for the fly ashes, with the appearance of compounds such as calcite. The formation of \nthose compounds is a result of self-hardening and carbonation of the ashes due to the atmospheric carbon \ndioxide. These changes in the mineralogy, promote a decrease on the solubility of the chemical elements, and a \ndecrease on pH and conductivity during the air exposition. Calcium was the major water soluble element with \nhigher concentration in the leaching solution, followed by potassium, sodium and chloride. A decrease on the \nleaching of calcium from the ash samples exposed to air conditions was noted. A possible explanation can be the \ndecrease of solubility of calcium compounds, due to the formation of compounds as calcite which are less \nsoluble than other Ca-base (such as CaO). \n\nA significant increase in the concentration of chloride in the leaching solution of fly ashes from the \nelectrostatic precipitator exposed to air during a period of six months was observed. This can be explained by \nmodifications in which Cl is bounded in the ashes, which becoming more soluble with time.  \n\nBa and Sr were the minor water soluble elements with higher concentration in the leaching solutions of ashes. \nDuring air exposition their concentrations decrease. This can be due to the forms in which those elements are \nbounded in the ashes, which becoming more insoluble with time.  \n\nThe results observed in this study, show that the process of ash - atmospheric air interaction is of major \nimportance considering the characterization of the ashes and their environmental management. The relevance of \nthis process appears to be dependent on the ash characteristics, and a deep understanding of this phenomenon is \nneeded in the perspective of material valorization of ashes. \n\n \n5 REFERENCES \n \n[1] A.
