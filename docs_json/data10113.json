Introduction\n\nThe major part of natural and artificial lakes is small and \nshallow (Wetzel, 1993), however, the knowledge of lentic \nwaters by several years was dominated by researches in the \ngreat lakes of Earth. These studies revealed that some aspects \nsuch as geographical position and morphometry play an \nimportant role in the lakes dinamics. According to Esteves \net al. (1988) the proposed models for temperate environ-\nments must not be applied directly to tropical lakes. The \nauthors point out that in temperate regions the seasonal \npattern, which cycle is practically annual and the presence of \nwell-defined seasons creates persistent distinctive situations. \nOn the other hand, the tropical aquatic environment seems \n\nto respond also to chemical, physical and biological short-\ntime environmental alterations (nycthemeral variation).\n\nLagoons and coastal lakes may also present different \nfunctional patterns. At these environments the wind direc-\ntion usually changes twice a day. In those places without \nnatural obstacles and with large water surface in relation to \nthe depth, it is usual to observe  physical, chemical, and also \nbiological homogenization in the water column throughout \nthe year (Petrucio, 1998).\n\nLocated at the coastal plains of the Rio Grande do Sul \nState (32\u00b0 01\u2019 40\u201d S and 52\u00b0 05\u2019 40\u201d W), the city of \nRio Grande comprises a stripe of lowlands in the Atlantic \n\n\n\n36 Trindade, CRT., Furlanetto, LM. and Palma-Silva, C.\n\nActa Limnol. Bras., 2009, vol. 21, no. 1, p. 35-44.\n\nCoast Restinga (coastal forests which form on sandy, acidic, \nand nutrient-poor soils) of Rio Grande, SW of the mouth \nof the Patos Lagoon (Vieira and Rangel, 1988). The re-\ngion has a Humid Subtropical Climate (Cfa at K\u00f6ppen\u2019s \nClassification) characterized by intense humidity in winter \nand spring and dry during summer. Northeast winds are \nfrequent most part of the year, however, in the months of \nautumn and winter, South winds and, especially, southwest \nwinds, become significantly important (Krusche et al., \n2002). \n\nThe low altimetric quotas of the city of Rio Grande do \nnot allow the formation of large rivers, as a result, small \nrivers (known as arroios) are the main components of its \ninternal hydrographic network (Vieira and Rangel, 1983). \nThe proximity of the water table to the soil surface makes \nfavorable the occurrence of temporary lagoons when the \npluviometric precipitation is heavier. The water is also pres-\nent in abundance in wetlands (banhados) and small lagoons \n(Krusche et al., 2002).\n\nPreliminary studies in small and shallow environments \nin the city of Rio Grande makes clear the development of \ndistinct biological communities (Albertoni et al., 2005; \nTrindade et al., 2008a; Trindade et al., 2008b). However, \nlittle is known about the functional dynamics of these sys-\ntems, since the limnological researches carried out in the \n\nRio Grande\u2019s Restinga have been performed predominantly \nin the great coastal lagoons, as instance (Sch\u00e4fer et al., \n1980; Sch\u00e4fer, 1988; Proen\u00e7a et al., 1988; Niencheski \net al., 1988).\n\n Facing the lack of information about shallow environ-\nments in southern Brazil, the present study aims to describe \nannual and daily cycles of limnological variables in a shallow \neutrophic waterbody.\n\n2. Material and Methods \n\n2.1. Study area\n\nThe Bigu\u00e1s Lake is located in the university campus \nof the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande \u2013 FURG \n(32\u00b0 04\u2019 43\u201c S and 52\u00b0 10\u2019 03\u201d W), in the city of \nRio Grande, Rio Grande do Sul State \u2013 Brazil (Figure 1). \nThe FURG\u2019s campus Carreiros has an area of approxi-\nmately 250 ha and is found in the way to downtown Rio \nGrande. In addition, is located near to the Environmental \nProtected Area of Verde Lagoon, the Atlantic Ocean and \nTaim Ecological Station (Votto et al., 2006).\n\nThe university campus possesses a group of small wa-\nterbodies that were the main water source for the city of \nRio Grande until the 70\u2019s. Anthropic activities which exist \nsince the beginning of the campus\u2019s construction in 1978 \n\nRio Grande\ndo Sul State\n\nPatos LagoonPatos Lagoon\n\nRio GrandeRio Grande\n\nAtlantic Ocean\n0 1 2\n\n32\u00b0 01\u2019 S\n52\u00b0 10\u2019 W\n\nBrazil\nN\n\nS\n\nW E\n\nCampus Correiros\nArea: 250ha\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3 2\n\n1\n\nLimnology\n\nBigu\u00e1s Lake\n\nOceanography\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n11\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1.

Bigu\u00e1s Lake, located at campus Carreiros, FURG, (Rio Grande, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil).\n\n\n\n Nycthemeral cycles and seasonal variation of limnological factors of a subtropical shallow lake (Rio Grande, RS, Brazil) 37\n\nActa Limnol. Bras., 2009, vol. 21, no. 1, p. 35-44.\n\nhave promoted several alterations in the line of margins, \ndepth, coastal vegetation, etc. Therefore, these small lagoons \nare a mix of original environments modified and environ-\nments completely built by human activities.\n\nThe Bigu\u00e1s Lake may be considered as an environment \nthat has been modified during the last 35 years. It has a \nsurface area of approximately 1.5 ha and depth that varies \naccordingly to the pluviosity, but not trespassing 2 m depth. \nIn its margins it is observed the presence of fixed floating \naquatic macrophytes, with predominance of Nymphoides \nindica (L.) Kuntze, and the amphibians and/or emergents \nPolygonum hydropiperoides Michx. Its surroundings are con-\nstituted basically by grass and some shrubs, with occurrences \nof Erytrina crista-galli L. and Salix humboldtiana Willd. In \nthe center of the lake  there are two  artificial islets used as \nshelter and resting place for cormorants, herons, teals and \ndomestic geese. Due to the occurrence of birds in the lake \nthere is an excessive input of organic matter, which is the \nmain source of nutrient enrichment, accelerating the eutro-\nphication process. As a result, frequent microalgae blooms \noccur and, in the summer months (drought season), it was \nobserved cyanobacterial blooms followed by great mortality \nof fish (personal observation).\n\n2.2. Sampling procedures\n\nSamplings were carried out monthly during the period \nof June/04 and May/05, collected in a small boat in the \ncenter of the lake. Sampling frequency for determination \nof nycthemeral variation of temperature, dissolved oxygen, \npH, electrical conductivity and alkalinity was performed \nin intervals of 6 hours, during two consecutive days, at \n6:00 AM, 12:00 PM and 6:00 PM. Depth and water trans-\nparency were measured with a 20 cm diameter Secchi disk \n(always at 12:00 PM). Temperature and dissolved oxygen \nconcentration (DO) were measured at each 10 cm depth \nonward to the bottom of the lake using a digital oximeter \n(Oakton\u00ae, USA). Samples from surface, medium and bot-\n\ntom of water column were collected using a pressure pump \nattached to a hose and conditioned in plastic bottles and \nimmediately transported to the laboratory for the measure-\nment of pH and electrical conductivity (pHmeter Hanna\u00ae, \nUK). The alkalinity was estimated by the Gran method \n(potentiometric titration using 0,01N H2SO4) according \nto Carmouze (1994).\n\nThe temporal variations of chlorophyll-a, suspended \nmaterial, and total nitrogen and phosphorus concentra-\ntions were obtained monthly from water surface samples. \nChlorophyll-a concentration was determined from the \nretained material of replicas from 250 mL water samples, \nfiltered through a fiber glass filter (GF/C Whatman\u00ae, USA). \nThe pigment extraction was carried out in 90% ethanol \nduring 24 hours (kept refrigerated at dark), and the estima-\ntive of the chlorophyll-a concentration was achieved with \na fluorometer Turner TD-700 (Turner BioSystems\u00ae, USA), \naccording to Welschmeyer (1994).\n\nThe suspended material concentration was measured by \nthe filtration of 250 mL water (GF/C Whatman\u00ae, USA). \nThe filters were kept in a 60 \u00b0C oven for 48 hours and sub-\nsequently weighted, performed according to the gravimetric \nmethod described by Paranhos (1996). The determination \nof total-N and total-P was carried out in separated aliquots \nof 500 mL water samples. The samples were conditioned in \npolyethylene bottles and kept frozen (\u201320 \u00b0C) for posterior \nanalysis in the Agency for the Development of the Mirim \nLagoon, Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul State, according to \nTedesco et al. (1995). The air temperature, pluviometric \nprecipitation, wind velocity and direction were obtained \nfrom the Meteorological Station \u2013 FURG.\n\n3.

Bras., 2009, vol. 21, no. 1, p. 35-44.\n\nThe analysis of the thermal structure of Bigu\u00e1s Lake \nallowed  the observation of a seasonal variation of wa-\nter temperature, that reaches lower values in the winter \n(14.9 and 16.3 \u00b0C) and higher levels in the summer \n(23.4 and 30.6 \u00b0C), according to the changes in the atmo-\nspheric temperatures (Figure 2). However, by means of the \nnycthemeral analysis in the four climatic seasons, it is also \npossible to note that the lake presents similar processes of \nwarming and cooling of the whole water column during \nthe daily cycles (Figure 3). The lower values of temperature \nwere observed in the first hours of the day (6:00 AM) and \nincreasing gradually until 12:00 PM. In the afternoon, \nbetween 12:00 and 6:00 PM, it was observed the cool-\ning of surface waters and at night, between 6:00 PM and \n6:00 AM of the next day, it was verified a decrease in the \nwater temperature in the whole water column.\n\nLower concentrations of dissolved oxygen (3.05 mg.L\u20131) \nwere found in October (spring), however, during the whole \nperiod studied it was not verified oxygen deficits in the \nwater column (Figure 2). The analysis of the nycthemeral \nvariation of dissolved oxygen showed a gradual increase in \nits concentration along the day, reaching maximum values \nat 6:00 PM, and decreasing during the night, verified at \n6:00 AM in the next morning (Figure 4).  Regarding the \noscillations observed during the day, the lake presented a \nhigh degree of dissolved oxygen saturation in the water \ncolumn in the three scheduled hours of samplings. The \nlowest percentages of oxygen saturation were found in \nOctober, in the deepest region (in the three scheduled time \nof sampling). During the months of January and February, \nat the end of the nocturnal period, it was not observed an \n\noxygen deficit in the lake. This fact indicates that despite \nthe influences of temperature in the solubility of the oxygen, \nthe production carried out in the superficial layers supplies \nthe bottom layers by the water circulation, preventing the \noccurrence of anoxic situations.\n\nIn this study it was found values of pH between \n6.78 and 10.3 (Figure 2), with lower values during peri-\nods of higher rainfall. Higher pH values were observed on \nthe surface mainly on the summer season (Table 3). The \nalkalinity observed ranging between 2.37 \u00b5Eq.L\u20131 and \n0.32 \u00b5Eq.L\u20131 (Figure 2). The nycthemeral variation patterns \nare different for each sampling month, with the higher \namplitudes observed in April and during the winter months \n(Table 4), but with small variations between surface and \nbottom. The electrical conductivity has remained higher \nthan 150 \u00b5S. cm\u20131 (Figure 2 and Table 5). In addition to the \nfluctuations between the scheduled times of samplings, no \ndifferences were observed between surface and bottom.\n\nThe values of the water transparency remained always \nbelow 0.1 m, particularly when the suspended material \n\nTable 2.

Discussion\n\nThe Bigu\u00e1s Lake is a shallow environment with a \nrelatively large surface area in relation to its depth. This \ncharacteristic facilitates the water circulation promoted by \nthe wind action, making the water column physical and \nchemical homogenized, which was observed in this study \nduring the daily cycles in all seasons. According to Esteves \n(1998) lakes with permanent circulation of the entire water \ncolumn (nonstratified) are denominated as holomitic-\npolimitic lakes. In these conditions the water density is \npractically the same in all depths, without physical and/or \nchemical barriers that would restrict the vertical distribution \nof the biological communities.\n\nIn spite of the variation of temperatures between the \nscheduled hours of samplings, the water column remained \nhomogeneous during the daily cycles in the four climatic \nseasons. According to Petrucio (1998) the homeothermy of \nthe water column, explained mainly by the frequent water \nmass circulation, is a consequence of the small depth and \ncontinuous exposition to the action of the wind. This pat-\ntern is similar to the one found by Esteves et al. (1988) in \nthe Lagoa Imboassica, Rio de Janeiro State, attributed to \nthe lake localization which is perpendicular to the coastline, \nexposed to the action of the marine and terrestrial breezes. \nIn the city of Rio Grande there are no natural or artificial \nbarriers that can obstruct the action of wind on the surface \nof aquatic environments. Notwithstanding, even located \napproximately 16 km from the coastline, the Bigu\u00e1s Lake \nis constantly under the action of the wind. \n\nAmong the gases dissolved in natural waters, the oxygen \nis one of the most important for the dynamics and char-\nacterization of the aquatic ecosystems (Wetzel and Likens, \n1991). The main oxygen sources for the aquatic environ-\nments are the atmosphere and photosynthesis, and the \nmineralization (decomposition of the organic matter and \nthe respiration of the organisms) is the main responsible \nfor the losses of this gas (Petrucio, 1998). In our study, the \nwind may have been responsible both for the input of dis-\nsolved oxygen due to the gas exchange between atmosphere \nand the aquatic environment, as well as for its distribution \nin the whole water column by means of the circulation of \nwater mass, facilitated by the shallowness of the lake. \n\nThe daily variation recorded in our study is similar varia-\ntions found by Ramirez and Bicudo (2003) in the Gar\u00e7as \n\nreservoir, S\u00e3o Paulo State. The increase of the dissolved \noxygen concentration during the day and its reduction \nduring the night were also related to the metabolism of the \nlake, with the dominance of diurnal processes of produc-\ntion and nocturnal mineralization. According to Sch\u00e4fer \net al. (1980) the degree of involvement of these processes \nin the water affects the daily variation of oxygen, so that the \nproduction depends on the light available, and each level \nof production correspond to two levels of consumption, \nrespiration and decomposition. It was most evident during \ntwo occasions: in spring, coinciding with the increase in \nprecipitation and elevation of suspended material, which \nmay have facilitated the process of decomposition of or-\nganic matter in the sediment and, consequently, the oxygen \nconsumption; and during summer, characterized by small \npluviometric precipitation, high temperatures and intense \nluminosity, factors that contribute to the photosynthetic \nactivity of the phytoplanktonic community, increasing lake \nproduction during the day, as well as the consumption at \nnight by the mineralization processes.\n\nThe water circulation re-suspends the precipitated mate-\nrial and seems to beneficiate the processes of the oxidation \nof organic matter in the deep regions and, consequently, \nto decrease the dissolved oxygen concentration. These re-\nsults coincide with low values of pH found at the bottom, \nsuggesting the occurrence of decomposition processes and \ninorganic CO2 release (Sipa\u00faba-Tavares, 1996). Mercante \nand Bicudo (1996) have observed lower values of pH during \nthe rainy seasons in Jacar\u00e9 Pond, S\u00e3o Paulo State.\n\nHigher pH values observed on the surface, mainly on \nthe summer season, were associated to photosynthesis of \nphytoplanktonic algae. The small pH variations indicate \nhigh buffering capacity for the lake, which may be sup-\nported by the elevated alkalinity observed. Environments \nwith elevated alkalinity present small variations of pH, even \nwith the occurrence of high photosynthetic rates, when the \nconsumption of CO2 is immediately compensated by the \nHCO3\n\n\u2013 dissociation (Esteves, 1998). \nThe variation of the electrical conductivity was depen-\n\ndent on both the variation of the water level as well as the \nseasonal metabolic activity, and consistent patterns were \nobserved in the nycthemeral variation. During the summer, \nwith the lowest volume of water, the absolute values of \nconductivity reached its maximum, probably by the natural \nincrease of the ionic concentration in a smaller volume of \nwater. In January, the lake has developed a growth of algae \n(bloom), which may have limited these figures, since later \nin February, with the decrease in chlorophyll-a values and \nconsequent decrease in phytoplankton biomass, there was \nan increase in the values of conductivity.\n\nThe values of water transparency remained when it was \ndetected increases in the suspended material concentra-\ntion. The low transparency values observed on the lake is \nprobably related to its shallowness, which together with \n\n\n\n Nycthemeral cycles and seasonal variation of limnological factors of a subtropical shallow lake (Rio Grande, RS, Brazil) 43\n\nActa Limnol.

According to alternative stable states theory of \nshallow lakes from Scheffer et al. (1993), the lakes can be \nin two alternative stable states: clear with abundant sub-\nmerged macrophytes or turbid with few submerged plants \ncharacterized by high algal biomass. The authors emphasize \nthat in the turbid state, fish promote phytoplankton growth \nby recycling nutrients and controlling the development of \nzooplankton that could otherwise help clear the water of \nphytoplankton. Also fish and waves may stir up sediments \nin shallow lakes with little or no vegetation. In this situ-\nation, light limitation and disturbance of the sediments \nmake it difficult for submerged plants to settle. On the \nother hand, once submerged plants are abundant, they can \ngreatly reduce turbidity by a suit of mechanisms resulting \nin control of excessive phytoplankton development and \nprevention of wave re-suspension of sediments (Scheffer \nand Van Nes, 2007).\n\nThe re-suspension of sediments also collaborates for \nthe increase of the nutrient concentrations in water col-\numn (Panosso and Kubrusly, 1998). During the study the \nelevated values of suspended material coincided with the \nhigher values of total-N and total-P. In some concentrations \nnitrogen and phosphorus may cause exaggerated growth of \naquatic macrophytes or the blooming of microalgae, mainly \ncyanobacteria (Ringelberg and Baard, 1988; Gophen, \n2001). In this study both nutrients were found at higher \nconcentrations in spring, period of the highest incidence \nof birds in the lake. This input of nutrients favored the \ngrowth of microalgae, fact noted by the variation in \nchlorophyll-a concentration in summer, which showed a \nconsiderable increase. The concentrations of chlorophyll-a \nabove 10 \u00b5g.L\u20131 are typical of eutrophic environments \n(Lampert and Sommer, 1997), which confirms the lake \nclassification. During this period were also observed the \nhighest values of conductivity, suspended matter, pH and \nalkalinity, with small variation between the scheduled hours \nof samplings.\n\nThe results obtained in the Bigu\u00e1s Lake have demon-\nstrated that besides the seasonal alterations suffered, daily \nchanges in its metabolism are also relevant for the under-\nstanding of its dynamics. Regional climatic variations such \nas: air temperature, wind speed, precipitation and sunlight \nare responsible for thermal and chemical changes in this \nlake. These processes occur uniformly in the water column \ndue to the constant circulation of the whole water mass, \nfacilitated by the low depth and action of the wind, which \nprevents the formation of physical and chemical stratifica-\ntions. The constant input of organic matter from birds must \nbe better understood, because this seems to be the main \nfactor responsible by the enrichment of the lake, increasing \nits productivity and, consequently, the processes of respira-\n\n\n\n44 Trindade, CRT., Furlanetto, LM. and Palma-Silva, C.\n\nActa Limnol.
