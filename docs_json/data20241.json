A presen\u00e7a de g\u00e1s livre ou acumula\u00e7\u00f5es de g\u00e1s nos \nsedimentos pode indicar a presen\u00e7a de reservat\u00f3rios de hidrocarbonetos em \nprofundidade. Este trabalho apresenta os resultados de uma campanha \ngeof\u00edsica realizada na margem continental Oeste da Galiza, no \u00e2mbito de um \nprojecto de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o para estudar um pockmark gigante descoberto nesta \nmargem, conhecido como Gran Burato. Os principais objectivos deste trabalho \nforam o re-processamento e interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o dos dados s\u00edsmicos multicanal, \nadquiridos na campanha BURATO4240. O processamento s\u00edsmico preliminar \nrealizado durante a campanha de aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o foi melhorado no \u00e2mbito deste \ntrabalho, com um fluxo de processamento mais pormenorizado (an\u00e1lise de \nvelocidades detalhada e migra\u00e7\u00e3o pr\u00e9-stack em tempo dos perfis mais \nrepresentativos), de modo a permitir uma melhor visualiza\u00e7\u00e3o da parte mais \nprofunda dos perfis s\u00edsmicos. A aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de t\u00e9cnicas de processamento \nutilizadas na ind\u00fastria melhorou a qualidade do processamento preliminar, em \nparticular, a resolu\u00e7\u00e3o das falhas e as partes mais profundas das sec\u00e7\u00f5es \ns\u00edsmicas, o que foi essencial para a interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00edsmica. No \u00e2mbito desta \ntese, a interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00edsmica preliminar foi detalhada e melhorada, as falhas \nprincipais foram espacialmente correlacionadas, e mapas estruturais e dos \nhorizontes interpretados foram criados em tempo e em profundidade. Foi \nconstru\u00eddo um mapa estrutural preliminar para a \u00e1rea de estudo, o que permite \num conhecimento integrado sobre poss\u00edveis mecanismos de forma\u00e7\u00e3o do Gran \nBurato, e tamb\u00e9m sobre a estrutura geol\u00f3gica observada nesta regi\u00e3o. A \norigem do Gran Burato parece estar relacionada com v\u00e1rios epis\u00f3dios de \nexpuls\u00e3o massiva de g\u00e1s que remobilizaram os sedimentos, dando origem a \nesta impressionante estrutura. Este g\u00e1s ter\u00e1 provavelmente migrado atrav\u00e9s \nde falhas para as unidades sedimentares mais superficiais, onde foi \nacumulado. Uma interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o preliminar de poss\u00edveis evid\u00eancias de escape e \nacumula\u00e7\u00f5es de fluidos (provavelmente g\u00e1s) foi realizada, e v\u00e1rias anomalias \nde amplitudes foram identificadas. As fracas evid\u00eancias de g\u00e1s na zona do \nGran Burato, aparentam suportar a ideia de que a maioria do g\u00e1s nesta zona j\u00e1 \nter\u00e1 escapado, provavelmente durante a forma\u00e7\u00e3o desta estrutura. Contudo, \nposs\u00edveis evid\u00eancias de g\u00e1s foram detectadas em \u00e1reas vizinhas. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n \n\nacknowledgments  \n\n \nForemost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. \nLuis Menezes Pinheiro.

The \npresence of free gas or gas accumulations in the sediments can also indicate \nhydrocarbon reservoirs in depth. This work presents the results of a \ngeophysical survey in the Western continental Galicia margin in the scope of a \nresearch project to investigate a giant pockmark discovered in this margin, \nknown as the Gran Burato. The main objectives of this work were the detailed \nre-processing and interpretation of the multichannel seismic data acquired \nduring the BURATO4240 survey. The preliminary processing carried out \nonboard during the cruise was improved in the scope of this work, with a more \ndetailed processing (detailed velocity analysis and pre-stack time migration of \nselected seismic lines), to better image the deeper part of the seismic sections. \nThe application of advanced processing techniques allowed the improvement \nof the onboard seismic processing, in particular, the imaging of the faults and \nthe deeper part of the seismic sections, which helped the seismic interpretation \nwork. In this thesis, the preliminary seismic interpretation was revised, \nimproved, the main faults were mapped, and time and depth structural and \nhorizon maps for the main interpreted seismic stratigraphic units were \nproduced. A preliminary structural map of the study area was obtained, which \ncontributes to a better knowledge about the possible formation of the Gran \nBurato, and the underlying geology. The origin of the Gran Burato seems to be \nrelated to episodes of massive expulsions of gas which lifted the overlying \nsediments into the water, which then were drifted away by the currents, and \ncreated this outstanding structure. This gas probably migrated to the upper \nstratigraphic sequences through the extensive faults, where it was \naccumulated. A preliminary interpretation of possible evidences of fluids (most \nlikely gas) accumulations and leakage were performed, and several amplitudes \nanomalies were identified. The weaker evidences of gas or other fluids around \nthe Gran Burato seem to support the idea that the majority of the gas has \nalready escaped, probably during the formation of this giant pockmark. \nHowever, possible evidences of gas accumulations were identified in areas \nfarther away. New multichannel seismic data acquired last August in the same \narea, will permit to confirm better some hypothesis rose in this work, and will \ncertainly represent a solid base to support this investigation work. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\ni \n \n\nContents \n\n \n\n \n\nAgradecimentos \n\nResumo \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nAbstract \n\nContents\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.i \n\nList of Figures ................................................................................................................. v \n\nList of Tables................................................................................................................. xxi \n\nChapter I.

Introduction \n \n\n \n\nI. 1 Nature and scope of this work \n\nThis thesis corresponds to the Final Project of the MSc Course on Geological \n\nEngineering, branch of Geological Resources, from the Geosciences Department of the \n\nUniversity of Aveiro, Portugal. This research work was carried out under the supervision of \n\nProf. Luis Menezes Pinheiro, from the University of Aveiro, with the support of the GRAN \n\nBURATO-2010 project. This project was funded by the University of Vigo, in the scope of \n\nthe Spanish research project \u201cProyecto da morfoestructura singular da marxe continental \n\noccidental da Galicia co\u00f1ecida como O Gran Burato\u201d, coordinated by Prof Daniel Rey \n\nGarcia from the University of Vigo, Spain. That project is part of a contract between the \n\nDirecci\u00f3n Xeral de Industria (Xunta de Galicia) and the University of Vigo, for the \n\ninvestigation of a large pockmark structure discovered in the Western Galicia continental \n\nmargin, known as Gran Burato, and was carried out with the participation of the \n\nUniversities of Aveiro (Portugal) and Granada (Spain). \n\nThe processing and interpretation of the seismic data presented in this work was carried \n\nout at the Marine Geology and Geophysics Laboratory of the Geosciences Department of \n\nthe University of Aveiro. \n\nIn the scope of this thesis, the author had the opportunity to participate in two scientific \n\nsurveys (BURATO4240 - October 2010; GRAN BURATO 2011 - August 2011) as a \n\nmember of the geophysical team responsible for the onboard seismic data processing. \n\nThe participation in several seismic processing data courses, in particular a two-week stay \n\nin the United States with Dr. Dan Herold and Dr. Matthew Ralston, from Paralell \n\nGeoscience Corporation, allowed the learning and application of advanced seismic data \n\nprocessing techniques, and were clearly an important and essential support for this thesis. \n\n \n\nI. 2 Objectives \n\nThe main objectives of the present work were the detailed re-processing and the \n\ninterpretation of the multichannel seismic data acquired during the BURATO4240 \n\nscientific survey. \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n2 \n \n\nDuring the acquisition cruise (Rey et al., in prep.) a preliminary onboard processing of the \n\nseismic profiles was performed by the geophysical team headed by L. M. Pinheiro \n\n(University of Aveiro), which included M. J. Rom\u00e1n-Alpiste (University of Granada), H. \n\nDuarte (LNEG \u2013 National Laboratory of Energy and Geology), L. Azevedo (University of \n\nAveiro/ IST \u2013 Technical Superior Institute) and the author of this work (University of \n\nAveiro). The first main objective of this thesis was to improve the preliminary onboard data \n\nprocessing with a more detailed processing, to better image the deeper part of the seismic \n\nsections. The new processing flow includes a detailed velocity analysis and the pre-stack \n\ntime migration of selected seismic lines. \n\nThe second main objective of this thesis was to carry out the interpretation of the \n\nprocessed seismic data. A preliminary seismic interpretation of the main seismic units and \n\nfaults was first performed at the University of Aveiro, for the preparation of the cruise \n\nreport (Pinheiro et al., 2010), with the collaboration of the author, and of Omar \n\nBennazzouz, an MSc student from the University of Tanger, Morroco. This preliminary \n\ninterpretation was used as a basis for this work. In this thesis the preliminary interpretation \n\nwas revised, improved, the main faults were mapped, and time and depth structural and \n\nhorizon maps for the main interpreted seismic stratigraphic units were produced. \n\n \n\nI. 3 Location of the Study Area \n\nThe study area is located in the Western Galicia continental margin (Spain). It is bounded \n\nby the parallels 42\u00baN and 43\u00baN and by the meridians 10\u00baW and 12\u00baW (Figure I.1). The \n\nwater depth in this region ranges between 1000m and 3000m.  \n\nThe Western Galicia continental margin is a non-volcanic passive rifted margin (Montadert \n\net al., 1974; Boillot et al., 1979; Boillot et al., 1995; P\u00e9rez-Gussiny\u00e9 and Reston, 2001) \n\nthat was reactivated in the Cenozoic due to the Africa-Eurasian convergence (e.g. \n\nMasson and Parson, 1983; Murillas et al., 1990; Pinheiro et al., 1992; Masson et al., 1994; \n\nBoillot et al., 1995; Whitmarsh et al., 1998). It extends from Cape Finisterre (~43\u00baN), in the \n\nNorth, to about ~40\u00baN, in the South  \n\nThe studied structure \u2013 the Gran Burato - is a fairly large slightly-elliptic topographic \n\ndepression (see Figure I.3), with a maximum diameter of 4km and a depth of about 130m. \n\nIt is located at approximately 42\u00ba40\u2019N and 11\u00ba04\u2019W, and at a water depth of 1650m. It has \n\nbeen interpreted as a giant pockmark and its formation is currently interpreted as \n\nassociated with a significant event of gas seepage. \n\n\n\nChapter I. Introduction \n\n \n\n3 \n \n\n \n\nFigure I.1 \u2013 Physiography of the Western Galicia continental margin (bathymetry from GEBCO \n\nDigital Atlas). The study area is highlighted by the red box; GB \u2013 Galicia Bank. \n\n \n\nI. 4 The BURATO4240 Survey \n\nThe BURATO4240 scientific survey was carried out approximately 150km off W Galicia, \n\nSpain, onboard of the R/V Sarmiento de Gamboa (Figure I.2) between the 16\nth\n of October \n\nand the 3\nrd\n of November 2010. \n\nThe main purpose of this survey was to investigate an area with several large topographic \n\ndepressions reported East of the Galicia Bank area (V\u00e1zquez et al., 2009; Ercilla et al., \n\n2011). The main aim of this research cruise was to investigate in detail these depressions, \n\nin particular one very large structure, known as the Gran Burato, also known as Burato \n\nERGAP (V\u00e1zquez et al., 2009). The BURATO4240 survey consisted of two cruise LEGs: \n\nLEG-1 (16\nth\n to the 26\n\nth\n of October, 2010) focused on the geophysical data acquisition, in \n\nparticular of multichannel seismic reflection profiles and multibeam bathymetry; LEG-2 \n\n(27\nth\n October to the 3\n\nrd\n November, 2010) concentrated on sampling of seabottom \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n4 \n \n\nsediments and benthic organisms with coring and beam trawls, respectively. The scientific \n\nteam consisted of scientific researchers and post-graduate students from the University of \n\nVigo (Spain), the University of Aveiro (Portugal) and the University of Granada (Spain). \n\n \n\nThe R/V Sarmiento de Gamboa \n\nThe Oceanographic Research Vessel Sarmiento de Gamboa (Figure I. 2 a,b), launched in \n\n2006, is a research vessel designed and constructed to work on multidisciplinary marine \n\nresearch topics. This vessel belongs to the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) \n\nand is operated by the Marine Technology Unit (UTM), which is responsible for \n\nmaintaining and operating the scientific equipment and providing the technical support \n\nstaff required to carry out the ocean research missions. She can accommodate up to a \n\nmaximum of 25 scientists. It has two crews, and can operate about 330 days per year. \n\n \n\nLEG-1: Geophysical Data Acquisition \n\nDuring LEG-1, a set of 34 multichannel seismic reflection lines (Figure I.3) were acquired \n\ntogether with multibeam bathymetry. The multichannel seismic data (MCS) data were \n\nacquired with a seismic source composed of an array of 10 airguns (1840cu in), and a \n\n2km long hydrophone streamer as the receiver array (Figure I. 2 c,d,e,f). The airguns \n\nused were GGUN-II from Sercel, calibrated with a pressure of 2000 psi, and towed at 7m \n\nwater depth, shooting every 50m. The streamer was a SAS Sentinel from Sercel with a \n\ntotal length of 2243m, 156 channels (8 hydrophones per channel), and a spacing between \n\nchannels of 12.5m. The recording length was 10 seconds (TWT) at 1 or 2ms sampling \n\ninterval. The streamer was towed at 7.5m water depth, and in order to maintain it stable, \n\n\u201cbirds\u201d were installed along the streamer approximately every 300m (Figure I. 2 e). The \n\npreliminary processing of the MCS data was fully carried out onboard by the geophysical \n\nteam. \n\nMore detailed information concerning the acquisition parameters and the multichannel \n\nseismic geometry acquisition are presented in the Chapter IV. \n\nDuring LEG-1, multibeam bathymetry was also acquired simultaneously with the seismic \n\ndata. For this purpose a multibeam system ATLAS\u00ae Hydrosweep DS, with a frequency of \n\n15.5 kHz, capable of operating between depths of 10m to 11000m, was used. The vertical \n\nresolution of this system is ~15cm, with a precision of 0.5cm, or 0.2% of water depth. \n\n\n\nChapter I.

The seismic lines form \n\na fairly dense grid of seismic lines, spaced about 500m in the East/West direction and \n\n1000m in the North/South direction, covering a total area of approximately 1000km \n\n(Figure I.3). \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n6 \n \n\n \n\nFigure I.3 \u2013 Study area, showing the location of the seismic lines acquired during the \nBURATO4240 LEG-1 survey.

Druet \nof Instituto Espa\u00f1ol de Oceanograf\u00eda (IEO). \n\n \n\nI. 6 Methodology \n\nIn order to accomplish the main objectives, two different methodologies were adopted: \n\none for the seismic data processing, and the other for the seismic data interpretation. \n\n \n\nSeismic Data Processing \n\nThe processing of the seismic profiles was performed with two different seismic \n\nprocessing software packages: \n\n(1) ProMAX (Seismic Data Processing Software) from Landmark \u2013 Halliburton. \n\nThis software was used to perform the preliminary onboard seismic processing \n\nduring the acquisition cruise, and also, in the scope of this work, by the author, \n\nusing one ProMAX license from LNEG. The adopted onboard seismic \n\nprocessing consisted of 5 main processing flows: Geometry Assignment; \n\nFrequency Filter; Velocity Analysis; Stack; and Post-Stack Time Migration. \n\nAfter a few tests, it was decided not to perform a deconvolution, in order to \n\n\n\nChapter I. Introduction \n\n \n\n7 \n \n\npreserve the maximum seismic signal possible, at this preliminary processing \n\nstage. \n\n(2) Seismic Processing Workshop (SPW), from Parallel Geoscience Corporation. \n\nThis software was used to improve the seismic processing of the most \n\nrepresentative seismic profiles, including pre-stack time migration of the most \n\nsignificant profiles. The main processing steps consisted of: Geometry \n\nAssignment; Frequency Filter; Velocity Analysis; Deconvolution; CMP sort; Radon \n\nDemultiple; Dip Moveout/Pre-Stack time migration; Post-Stack time migration and \n\nBandwidth Extension. \n\n \n\nSeismic Interpretation \n\nThe seismic interpretation was carried out using the Kingdom Suite seismic interpretation \n\npackage, thanks to a software donation to the University of Aveiro by Seismic Micro-\n\nTechnology, to whom we thank, and whose support was crucial for this work. The \n\npreliminary interpretation was checked, refined and the deeper seismic stratigraphic units \n\nwere interpreted following classification of Murillas et al. (1990) and Ercilla et al. (2008). \n\nThis interpretation was then correlated to all the seismic profiles and verified at seismic \n\nlines intersections. Horizons maps for the main units, in time and depth, were created. \n\nThe main faults were mapped, spatially correlated and structural maps for the study area, \n\nwere obained. Finally, a preliminary study on the seismic expression of potential gas \n\naccumulation and leakage was carried out. \n\n \n\nI. 7 Structure of this thesis \n\nThe thesis is divided into six chapters. This first chapter briefly introduces the reader to \n\nthe nature and scope of this work, the main objectives, the location of the study area, the \n\nscientific survey, the dataset and the methodology used. It ends with this brief description \n\nof the thesis structure. \n\nThe second chapter presents the study area, describes the geological setting and \n\ndescribes the geological structures investigated. A detailed analysis of the main seismic-\n\nstratigraphic units identified in this area is also included. \n\nThe third chapter starts with a briefly description of the seismic reflection method, the \n\nnecessary equipment and the marine acquisition method. The basic general seismic data \n\nprocessing steps for 2D seismic data are also described. \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n8 \n \n\nThe fourth chapter starts with a description of the preliminary onboard processing flow and \n\nthe results obtained. This is followed by a detailed description of seismic processing flow \n\nused in the scope of this work to improve the seismic imaging, and a comparison of the \n\nfinal processed sections with the previous preliminary processing is presented. \n\nThe fifth chapter presents the results from the cartography of the main faults and of the \n\nmain seismic-stratigraphic horizons, interpreted using Kingdom Suite software. A \n\npreliminary investigation of seismic expression of gas accumulations and leakage is also \n\nincluded at the end of this chapter. \n\nThe sixth chapter presents the final conclusions and suggestions for future work. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n9 \n \n\nChapter II. Geological Setting of the Study Area \n \n\n \n\nII. 1 Introduction \n\nThe Iberian Peninsula is located in the Eurasian Plate, north of the present-day \n\nAfrica/Eurasia plate boundary (Figure II.1). Since the Oligocene, Iberia has been part of \n\nthe Eurasian plate, with the boundary between the African and the Eurasian plates located \n\nat its present position along the Azores-Gibraltar fracture zone. This plate boundary \n\nextends eastwards from the A\u00e7ores, in the West, to the Mediterranean, in the East \n\n(Klitgord and Schouten, 1986; Srivastava et al., 1990a; Srivastava et al., 1990b). The \n\nprecise location of this plate boundary East of Gorringe Bank, in the vicinity of the \n\nGibraltar Straight, is still a matter of debate (Pinheiro et al., 1996; Gutscher et al., 2002; \n\nZitellini et al., 2009; Terrinha et al., 2009). \n\n \n\nFigure II.1 \u2013 Detail of the North Atlantic bathymetric map in the vicinity of the study area (data from \nthe GEBCO Digital Atlas) with the location of the Iberian Peninsula and the plate boundaries. The \nblack line corresponds to a simplified location of the plate boundaries, after Coffin et al. (1998). \n\n \n\nAnalysis of seafloor-spreading magnetic anomalies, complemented by paleomagnetic \n\nstudies (Van der Voo and Zijderveld, 1971; Galdeano et al., 1989), suggest that the \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n10 \n \n\nseparation between Iberia and Newfoundland occurred during the Early Cretaceous \n\n(Whitmarsh et al., 1990; Pinheiro et al., 1992; Whitmarsh and Miles, 1995; Pinheiro et al., \n\n1996). Several studies on plate tectonic reconstruction on the North American and \n\nEuropean continental margins indicate that the southeastern margin of the Canadian \n\nGrand Banks is the conjugate of the West Iberia margin (e.g. Bullard et al., 1965; Le \n\nPichon and Sibuet, 1971; Boillot and Capdevila, 1977; Olivet et al., 1984; Masson and \n\nMiles, 1984; Srivastava and Tapscott, 1986; Srivastava et al., 1990b; Srivastava and \n\nVerhoef, 1992). \n\nThe western Iberian margin, like the conjugate Grand Banks margin, is a non-volcanic \n\npassive rifted margin (Montadert et al., 1974; Boillot et al., 1979) since there is no \n\nevidence of significant syn-rift volcanism, neither onshore or offshore (Pinheiro, 1994; \n\nSawyer et al., 1994;Pinheiro et al., 1996; Whitmarsh and Miles, 1995). Furthermore, MCS \n\nreflection sections do not reveal any indication of seaward-dipping reflector sequences \n\n(Mauffret and Montadert, 1987; Mauffret et al., 1989; Pickup et al., 1996) and modeling of \n\nwide-angle seismic profiles across the margin did not show the typical high-velocities \n\nassociated with lower crustal underplated bodies characteristic of volcanic margins \n\n(Pinheiro et al., 1992; Pinheiro, 1994; Whitmarsh et al., 1996b; Chian et al., 1999). \n\nInstead, evidence of serpentinization of the mantle was found (Pinheiro et al., 1992; \n\nPinheiro, 1994; Sawyer et al., 1994; Pinheiro et al., 1996; Whitmarsh et al., 1998). \n\nThe West Iberia margin has been the focus of several geological and geophysical \n\ninvestigations during the last few decades. Until present, this margin has been extensively \n\ninvestigated with different geophysical methods, such as magnetic, gravity, deep \n\nmultichannel seismic profiles (Mauffret and Montadert, 1987; Murillas et al., 1990; \n\nPinheiro et al., 1992; Pinheiro,1994; Henning et al., 2004) and wide-angle profiles \n\n(Whitmarsh et al., 1996b; Perez-Gussinye et al., 2003). It has been drilled in the scope of \n\none DSDP\n1\n and three ODP\n\n2\n LEGs (Galice, 1979; Boillot et al., 1987); and this contributed \n\nsignificantly to a much better understanding of the geological and geodynamic evolution of \n\nthis area (e.g. Galice, 1979; Mauffret and Montadert, 1987; Boillot and Malod, 1988; \n\nMurillas et al., 1990; Srivastava et al., 1990a; Srivastava et al., 1990b;Whitmarsh et al., \n\n1990; Pinheiro et al., 1992; Pinheiro et al., 1996; Whitmarsh et al., 1996b; Ercilla et al., \n\n2008; V\u00e1zquez et al., 2008; V\u00e1zquez et al., 2009).  \n\n                                                \n1\n  - Deep Sea Drilling Program - The Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) was the first of three international \n\nscientific ocean drilling programs that have operated over more than 40 years. \n2\n  - Ocean Drilling Program - The Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) is an international research \n\norganization that conducts seagoing expeditions to study the history of the Earth recorded in sediments and \nrocks beneath the ocean floor. \n\n\n\nChapter II. Geological Setting of the Study Area \n\n11 \n \n\nII. 2 Formation and Structural Evolution of the Western Iberia \n\nMargin \n\nThe width of the West Iberia continental shelf varies between 10-65 km along its \n\napproximate 700km length. As pointed out by Vanney and Mougenot (1981) and \n\nMougenot (1988), this margin can be divided in three main distinct structurally domains \n\n(Figure II.2): the Tagus Abyssal Plain (TAP; 37\u00ba\u2013 39\u00baN), the Iberia Abyssal Plain (IAP; \n\n39\u00ba\u2013 41\u00baN) and the Deep Galicia Margin (DGM, 41\u00ba\u2013 43\u00baN).  \n\n \n\nFigure II.2 - Bathymetric map of the Western and Southern Iberia margin (data from GEBCO \nDigital Atlas). The margin is divided in three main segments: DGM \u2013 Deep Galicia Margin; IAP \u2013 \nIberia Abyssal Plain; TAP \u2013 Tagus Abyssal Plain. The Galicia Interior Basin (GIB) is located \nbetween Galicia Bank (GB) and the continental shelf; contours every 1000m. \n\n \n\nAlthough still a matter of debate, the seafloor spreading in the West Iberia Margin is \n\nthought to have begun at anomaly M11 (~134 My) in the Tagus Abyssal Plain (Pinheiro et \n\nal., 1992; Pinheiro et al., 1996), during anomaly M3 (~125 My) near the ODP site 897 in \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n12 \n \n\nthe periodotite ridge at the Iberian Abyssal Plain (Whitmarsh and Miles, 1995), and in  the \n\nLate Aptian, in the Deep Galicia Margin (Lower Cretaceous) (Boillot and Winterer, 1988; \n\nPinheiro et al., 1996). Studies based on MCS and wide-angle seismic profiles across the \n\ntwo northern provinces suggest that, from East to West, the Ocean-Continent Transition \n\n(OCT) across this margin consists of: (1) thinned continental crust characterized, at least \n\non its seaward edge, by rotated fault blocks with possible mafic intrusions; (2) a zone of \n\nexhumed continental mantle (ZECM) at the OCT, in which mantle rocks have been \n\nserpentinized to varying degrees and; (3) an acoustic basement with the seismic and \n\nmagnetic signatures typical of oceanic crust, to the West (Pinheiro et al., 1992; Pinheiro, \n\n1994; Sibuet et al., 1995; Whitmarsh and Miles, 1995; Pickup et al., 1996; Whitmarsh et \n\nal., 1996a). \n\nThe Iberia continental margin was developed during the northward propagation of the \n\nAtlantic Ocean rift system, which involved several rifting phases from the Triassic to the \n\nEarly Cretaceous (Wilson et al., 1989; Pinheiro et al., 1992; Pinheiro et al., 1996; Figure \n\nII.3). During this northward propagation, three main rifting episodes have affected the west \n\nIberia margin: (1) a late Triassic to Early Jurassic (Hettangian) rifting event; (2) a Upper \n\nJurasic (late Oxfordian/early Kimmeridgian) rifting event (documented by Wilson et al., \n\n1989, as the first episodes of rifting, located on the Lusitanian Basin), and (3) a Early \n\nCretaceous (Valanginian/Hauterivian to Aptian) rifting episode that culminated with the \n\nformation of oceanic crust and separation of Iberia from the Grand Banks of Canada \n\n(Wilson et al., 1989; Manatschal and Bernoulli, 1999; Pinheiro et al., 1996; Figure II.3) \n\nThis rifting between Iberia and the Grand Banks proceeded intermittently during the Late \n\nPaleozoic and Mesozoic, culminating in the continental breakup in the Early Cretaceous \n\n(Rasmussen et al., 1998). Its complete separation from North America in the late Aptian \n\nwas followed by the development of a separate Iberian micro-plate successively attached \n\nto Eurasia and Africa (Srivastava et al., 1990b). \n\nThe tectonic style of the continental margin acquired during the main rifts episodes is \n\nessentially characterized by tilted fault blocks bounded by seaward dipping normal faults \n\n(Figures II.3; II.4 and II.5) which delineated a series of half-grabens (Mauffret and \n\nMontadert, 1987; Thommeret et al., 1988; Sibuet, 1992). These features are frequently \n\nobserved on seismic reflection profiles (Galice, 1979; Krawczyk et al., 1996; Pickup et al., \n\n1996). Sibuet et al. (1987) showed that, off Galicia, these half-graben structures trend \n\ndominantly North-South; however, in the southern Iberia Abyssal Plain and in the Tagus \n\n\n\nChapter II. Geological Setting of the Study Area \n\n13 \n \n\nAbyssal Plain the trend of the continental blocks appears to be more variable (Whitmarsh \n\net al., 1990; Pinheiro et al., 1992; Pinheiro, 1994; Whitmarsh and Miles, 1995). \n\n \n\nFigure II.3 - Temporal and spacial evolution scheme of the West Iberia rifting process, showing the \n(1) inicial process of the rift, (2) the advanced rift phase, where the rift \u201cjumps\u201d to the west, until (3) \nthe final phase of seafloor spreading (modified from Manatschal and Bernoulli, 1999; in Druet and \nYepes, 2010).  \n\n \n\nThe mechanism of lithospheric extension that originated this continental breakup is also \n\nstill a matter of debate. According to Sibuet (1992), it seems that a composite model \n\ninvolving pure-shear affecting the whole lithosphere and simple-shear affecting only the \n\nupper brittle crustal levels, along a low angle detachment that soles out at the \n\nbrittle/ductile transition, can best explain the observations. A very strong seismic reflector \n\nimaged on the available seismic sections West of Galicia Bank \u2013 the \u201cS-Reflector\u201d \u2013 is a \n\ngood candidate for such a detachment (Boillot et al., 1989, Sibuet, 1992; Reston, 1996; \n\nReston et al., 1996a). Brun and Beslier (1996), however, demonstrated through analog \n\nmodeling, that the observed conjugate margin geometry could equally have formed under \n\npure shear only. \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n14 \n \n\nAfter the large extensional rift event, the West Iberia margin has suffered compressional \n\nepisodes during the Cenozoic, due to the convergence between the African and the \n\nEurasian plates. These events were responsible for the formation of the Pyrenean and \n\nAlpine orogenies (e.g. Masson and Parson, 1983;Murillas et al., 1990; Masson et al., \n\n1994;Pinheiro et al., 1996; Brun and Beslier, 1996). Along the West Iberia margin these \n\ncompressive episodes occurred mainly during the Eocene and the Miocene (Boillot et al., \n\n1979; Ribeiro, 1988; Srivastava et al., 1990a; Ribeiro et al., 1990; Malod et al., 1993; \n\nMasson et al., 1994; Pinheiro et al., 1996). \n\nThe Miocene compressional episode was responsible for the formation of the Betic chain \n\nin southeastern Iberia (Sibuet and Le Pichon, 1971; Murillas et al., 1990), and it was the \n\nresult of the convergence between Africa and Europe/Iberia (e.g. LeBlanc and Olivier, \n\n1984). Plate tectonic models for the Early Miocene predict a NW-directed compression \n\n(Roest and Srivastava, 1991). \n\nThe Eocene deformation episode is essentially related to the formation of the Pyrenean-\n\nCantabrian Chain and to the incipient subduction developed in the southern Bay of Biscay \n\n(Sibuet and Le Pichon, 1971; Grimaud et al., 1982; Malod et al., 1993) which resulted \n\nfrom the convergence between Iberia and Europe (Masson et al., 1994; Pinheiro et al., \n\n1996). Analyses of plate tectonic movements in the Bay of Biscay suggest that about \n\n40km of N to NW shortening took place during a episode of right-lateral strike-slip during \n\nthe Early Tertiary (Srivastava and Tapscott, 1986; Roest and Srivastava, 1991), which is \n\ncompatible with the history of the Pyrenees, where relative motion between Europe and \n\nIberia evolved from NW to NE compression through the Early Tertiary (e.g. Guimera, \n\n1984; De Ruig et al., 1991).  \n\nStrong evidence offshore of Cenozoic reactivation of late Variscan faults as reverse faults \n\nor transpressive strike-slip structures are observed, particularly during the Eocene and the \n\nMiocene (Boillot et al., 1979; Mauffret et al., 1989; Masson et al., 1994; Pinheiro, 1994; \n\nPinheiro et al., 1996), which appears to continue today. These fault reactivations are \n\nsuggested by the localized presence of seafloor scarps above compressional structures \n\nwithin the ocean/continent transition, accompanied by deformation of recent sediments \n\n(Pinheiro, 1994; Masson et al., 1994; Pinheiro et al., 1996; Alves et al., 2003a).  \n\nThe Cenozoic deformation in the abyssal domain is predominantly characterized by a \n\nbroad oceanward-facing monoclinal sequence that can be several tens of kilometers wide, \n\nand which most of the times terminates in a tight asymmetric fold, generally related with a \n\nsteeply dipping fault or faults (Masson et al., 1994). \n\n\n\nChapter II. Geological Setting of the Study Area \n\n15 \n \n\nAs a result of these rifting and deformation phases, the Western Iberia margin and its \n\nonshore extension were differentiated into a series of uplifted blocks (e.g. Estremadura \n\nspur) and areas of relative subsidence (e.g. Lower Tagus Basin) (Rasmussen et al., 1998; \n\nAlves et al., 2003a). \n\nThe numerous observations described by several authors (e.g. Le Pichon and Sibuet, \n\n1971; Pinheiro et al., 1992; Malod et al., 1993; Masson et al., 1994; Whitmarsh and Miles, \n\n1995; Pinheiro et al., 1996) about the reactivation of the West Iberia margin suggest that \n\nthis reactivation occurred essentially in a transpressional strike-slip regime associated to a \n\nNW-SE Africa-Iberia-Eurasia convergence during the Cenozoic. This tectonic regime \n\nreactivated the NNE-SSW normal faults that controlled the Mesozoic rifting phase \n\n(Pinheiro et al., 1996). \n\nIn several recent studies a change in the convergence direction between Africa and \n\nEurasia during the Neogene was proposed: (i) NNE since the Upper Oligocene until \n\nLower Miocene; (ii) NNW starting on the Middle Miocene until the Upper Miocene; (iii) NW \n\nsince the Upper Miocene (De Vicente et al., 2008), continuing with the maximum \n\ncompression (NW-SE) practically constant until the present (Galindo-Zaldivar et al., 1993; \n\nDe Vicente et al., 1996; De Vicente, 2004). This present day stress regime with WNW-\n\nWSE direction induces the activity of (1) normal faults with direction NW-SE, (2) the \n\nmovement of strike-slip faults NNE-SSW (left movement) and ESE-WNW (right \n\nmovement), and (3) the movement of inverse faults with direction NE-SW (De Vicente et \n\nal., 2008). \n\nToday, the main seismicity activity in the Western continental Iberia margin is located at or \n\nclose to the Eurasian/Africa plate boundary, particularly in the Gorringe Bank region, and \n\na moderate intraplate seismicity is also associated with Tore Seamount and along the \n\noffshore extensions of late Variscan basement faults (e.g. Pinheiro et al., 1996; Terrinha \n\net al., 2009). \n\n \n\nII. 3 The Western Galicia Continental Margin \n\nThe West Galicia margin extends from the Finisterre Cape (~43\u00baN), in the north, until a \n\nlatitude of approximately 40\u00baN, in the south. It has been defined as a sediment-starved, \n\nnon-volcanic rifted continental margin (Montadert et al., 1974; Boillot et al., 1979; Sibuet, \n\n1992; Boillot et al., 1995; Perez-Gussinye and Reston, 2001).  \n\n \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n16 \n \n\nII.3.1 Physiography  \n\nThe West Galicia margin shows a complex structural configuration recognizable in the \n\nseafloor morphology (Reston, 2005). This area can be divided into four main \n\nmorphostructural provinces: a structural high (the Galicia Bank), the Deep Galicia Margin, \n\na Transitional zone, and a large basin about 100 km wide with water depths reaching \n\n3000 m \u2013 the Galicia Interior Basin (Figure II.4). The latter, is an intraslope marginal basin \n\nbounded by NNW\u2013SSE normal faults and controlled by NE\u2013SW transfer faults which \n\ncorresponds to the submerged part of the Lusitanian basin (Alves et al., 2003b). The \n\nGalicia Bank is the most important of these features, which have been interpreted as \n\nreactivated extensional horsts (Pinheiro et al., 1996). The Transitional Zone is formed by a \n\nset of structural seamounts and marginal platforms controlled by normal faults and \n\ngathered in a NW\u2013SE trend (V\u00e1zquez et al., 2008). Finally, the Deep Galicia Margin is \n\nconstituted by a set of extensional rotated blocks (Mauffret and Montadert, 1987;Reston et \n\nal., 1996a). \n\n \n\nFigure II.4 \u2013 Bathymetric map of the Western continental Galicia margin (data from GEBCO Digital \nAtlas). This area can be divided into four main morphostructural provinces: GB \u2013 Galicia Bank; \nDGM \u2013 Deep Galicia Margin; TZ \u2013 Transitional Zone; GIB \u2013 Galicia Interior Basin. \n\n \n\nDespite its complexity, this margin is now considered a reference model to characterize \n\nthe structure of simple-shear asymmetric extensional margins (Boillot et al., 1995; Reston \n\n\n\nChapter II. Geological Setting of the Study Area \n\n17 \n \n\net al., 1996b), the rift-to-drift transition in the evolution of passive non-volcanic rifted \n\nmargins (Whitmarsh and Wallace, 2001; Perez-Gussinye et al., 2006), as well the \n\ncontinental-ocean boundary at non-volcanic passive margins (Beslier et al., 1993; \n\nWhitmarsh et al., 1996b). \n\n \n\nII.3.2 Tectonic Evolution and Structural Control \n\nThe two successive Mesozoic extensional phases have caused a complex fault system \n\ncomposed of N-S to NW-SE normal faults and NE-SW transfer faults that corresponds to \n\nlate Variscan structures reactivated during the Mesozoic rifting episodes (Ribeiro et al., \n\n1979; Pinheiro et al., 1996; V\u00e1zquez et al., 2008). The first extensional phase is related to \n\nthe Triassic rift system that formed between Europe, Africa and North America prior to the \n\nopening of the central Atlantic (Mauffret and Montadert, 1987; Murillas et al., 1990; \n\nHenning et al., 2004). The second extensional phase took place from the Upper Jurassic \n\nto the Early Cretaceous, during the opening of the North Atlantic Ocean and the \n\nprogressive northward continental break-up, sometime between 133 and 112My (Mauffret \n\nand Montadert, 1987; Boillot and Malod, 1988; Pinheiro et al., 1996 Pinheiro et al., 1996; \n\nSrivastava et al., 1990a). Reston (2005), however, proposed that there were multiple \n\nphases of extensional faulting during the evolution of this margin in a diachronous \n\nmanner, and these new extensional phases produced fault reactivations in the context of \n\na consecutive westward migration of the tectonic activity. Extensional tectonics observed \n\nin the Galicia Bank region can be correlated with the kinematics of the north Atlantic. \n\nThese tectonic movements can be divided into three main distinct stages: pre-rift, syn-rift, \n\nand post-ryft (Mauffret and Montadert, 1988; Murillas et al., 1990). \n\nFrom the Paleogene until the Miocene, this margin was affected by the compressive \n\nregime of Cenozoic age, described above, that reactivated the Mesozoic fault system, \n\naffecting the physiography of the margin (Pinheiro et al., 1996). \n\nThe observed structures in the Western Galicia margin are generally oriented according to \n\nthree predominant directions (Figure II.5): (1) NS (N340\u00b0 - N020\u00b0) normal faults, parallel or \n\nsub-parallel to the margin; and (2) NE-SW (N055\u00ba - N070\u00b0) and (3) NW-SE (N115\u00b0 - \n\nN135\u00b0) transverse faults (Galice, 1979; Mougenot, 1988; Thommeret et al., 1988). \n\nV\u00e1zquez et al. (2008) have also identified large reverse faults trending NE-SW to ENE-\n\nWSW (see Figure II.7). \n\nDifferent faults and structural trends are observed in the regions located North and South \n\nof latitude 42\u00baN (Galice, 1979; Sibuet et al., 1987; Mougenot, 1988). In the North, like in \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n18 \n \n\nthe Galicia Bank, the faults have a predominant orientation of N150\u00ba; to the South the \n\npredominantly directions are N060\u00ba and N-S.  \n\n \n\nFigure II.5 \u2013 Structural framework of the NW Iberia continental margin: (1) \u2013 basement or \nMesozoic outcrops; (2) \u2013 Seismic Unit 1 outcrop (Upper Eocene \u2013 Quaternary); (3) \u2013 normal faults; \n(4) \u2013 horsts or top of tilted blocks ; (5) \u2013 inverse faults (in Mougenot, 1988) \n\n \n\nWithin the GIB, the most common direction of the basin bounding faults follows a NNW-\n\nSSE to NW-SE trend and is clearly affected by NE-SW transfer faults (Boillot et al., 1989; \n\nMurillas et al., 1990; Figure II.6). On the basis of this structural framework, an \n\napproximately NE-SW direction can be inferred for the main Cretaceous stretching \n\nepisode of the basin, i.e Valanginian tectonics (Murillas et al., 1990). However, some of \n\nthe transfer faults were subsequently reactivated as normal faults during the Hauterivian-\n\nAptian interval (e.g. DSDP Site 398; Murillas et al., 1990) which could be explained by a \n\njump to the west of the rift, associated with a possible change in the morphological and \n\n\n\nChapter II. Geological Setting of the Study Area \n\n19 \n \n\nrheological characteristics of the crust, and by the rotation of the compression direction \n\nfrom NE-SW to NW-SE, at the beginning of the Hauterivian (Boillot et al., 1989; Murillas et \n\nal., 1990). \n\n \n\nFigure II.6 \u2013 Structural setting of the NW Galicia continental margin and adjacent abyssal domains \n(after Boillot et al., 1989, and Murillas et al., 1990; in V\u00e1zquez et al., 2008). \n\n \n\nTwo types of Cenozoic normal faults have been identified: normal reactivated extensional \n\n(N\u2013S; NW\u2013SE) or transfer (NE \u2013 SW) Mesozoic faults and neoformed faults related or \n\nunrelated to the basement structure (V\u00e1zquez et al., 2008; Figure II.7). \n\nIn summary, three main groups of structural features that have affected the post-rift \n\nsedimentary units can be identified in this margin: (1) normal faults (NS and NW-SE) of \n\nMesozoic age, that have been reactivated and affected the whole post-rift sedimentation \n\nsequence (Murrillas et al., 1990; V\u00e1zquez et al., 2008); (2) folds and flexures observed in \n\nthe Galicia Bank (V\u00e1zquez et al., 2008) and monocline folds due to the reactivation of \n\nnormal NW-SE faults (Murillas et al., 1990; Perez-Gussinye et al., 2003); these folds tend \n\nto affect only the most recent sedimentary units (V\u00e1zquez et al., 2008); (3) reverse faults, \n\nin particular the compressive northwest belt of the Galicia Bank, with a NNE-SSW \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n20 \n \n\ndirection in the southern segment and an ENE-WSW in the North (Galice, 1979; Malod et \n\nal., 1993; V\u00e1zquez et al., 2008).  \n\n \n\nFigure II.7 \u2013 Tectonic map and location of main morphostructural provinces defined on the Galicia \nBank Region. The coulours display the multibeam bathymetry (after Ercilla et al., 2006) completed \nby the structural frame (from V\u00e1zquez et al., 2008). \n\n \n\nII.3.3 Seismic Stratigraphy  \n\nThe sedimentary cover of the West Galicia Margin varies from 0 to 4 km comprising \n\nsediments from the Oxfordian to the Quaternary with an irregular spatial distribution \n\n(Mauffret and Montadert, 1988). The seismic stratigraphy of the northwestern Iberian \n\nmargin has been defined and refined by several authors (e.g., Mauffret and Montadert, \n\n1988; Murillas et al., 1990; Ercilla et al., 2008), based on the correlation of an important \n\nset of seismic data with drilling and well results. Groupe Galice (1979), based on the IODP \n\nLeg 47b (Sibuet and Ryan, 1979) to the south of Vigo Seamount, and Mauffret and \n\nMontadert (1987, 1988) based on ODP Leg 103 (Boillot et al., 1987) to the southwest of \n\nthe Galicia Bank, proposed a set of seismic-stratigraphic units limited by unconformities of \n\nregional significance. \n\n\n\nChapter II. Geological Setting of the Study Area \n\n21 \n \n\nMurillas et al. (1990) defined seven main Seismic Units (7 to 1, from the oldest to the \n\nyoungest; Figure II.8) which can be grouped into three categories, according to their \n\nrelationship with the structural evolution of the margin: (1) pre-rift units, that comprise \n\nSeismic Units 7 and 6 (Oxfordian to Berriasian); (2) syn-rift units, that comprise Seismic \n\nUnits 5 and 4 (Valanginian to Aptian); and (3) post-rift units, that comprise Seismic Units \n\n3, 2 and 1 (Albian to Quaternary) (Boillot and Malod, 1988; Murillas et al., 1990).  \n\nMore recently, Ercilla et al. (2008), using single-channel high resolution seismic profiles, \n\ndetailed the previous interpretation (Murillas et al., 1990) of the upper five Seismic Units (5 \n\nto 1, from the oldest to youngest; Figure II.9) dividing Seismic Unit 1 into three sub-units \n\n(1A, 1B and 1C). These seismic units were observed above a very irregular acoustic \n\nbasement, highly fractured, defining a system of horsts, grabens and half-grabens, and \n\nlocal outcrops forming isolated highs and escarpments (Murillas et al., 1990). \n\nThe seismic stratigraphy used in this thesis results from a compilation of the several \n\ncharacteristics described for the seismic units of this region by Murillas et al. (1990), using \n\nmultichannel seismic data, and by Ercilla et al. (2008), using single-channel high \n\nresolution seismic data. A summary of the characteristics of the several seismic units, \n\nsuch as acoustic facies, configuration and thickness, can be consulted in Table II.1. \n\n \n\nSeismic Unit 1 \n\nSeismic Unit 1 (turbidites and hemipelagites/pelagite of Late Eocene to recent) shows a \n\nwidespread distribution throughout the Galicia Bank region and adjacent Iberia and \n\nAbyssal Plains. This sedimentary unit has normally a seismic velocity of about 2.2km/s, \n\nand a thickness of around 1s (TWT). Seismic Unit 1 can be divided in two sequences or \n\nsubunits (1A [upper] and 1B [lower]) by a continuous reflection in the central part of the \n\nformation (Murillas et al., 1990). Subunit 1A is characterized by good reflection continuity, \n\nwith variable amplitude. This subunit (1A) has been further subdivided by Ercilla et al. \n\n(2008), into two smaller sequences (1A and 1B): 1A is characterized by high amplitude \n\nreflections with high lateral continuity, and a uniform thickness of 40-60ms (TWT); 1B is \n\ncharacterized by stratified facies with a thickness of 70 to 170ms (TWT), but with poorer \n\nlateral continuity.  \n\nThe subunit 1B (following Murillas et al. (1990) and which corresponds to the Seismic Unit \n\n1C defined by Ercilla et al. (2008)) has a thickness of 400 to 650 ms (TWT), and both \n\nauthors classified it as having a more transparent aspect. It is classified by reflections of \n\nhigh lateral continuity with low acoustic amplitude. In some places, subunit 1B forms \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n22 \n \n\nsedimentary ridges probably associated to contour currents (Murillas et al, 1990). In the \n\nGalicia continental slope, and in particular on the northern part of the basin, the distinction \n\nbetween subunits 1A and 1B is not clear, and Seismic Unit 1 shows a more contorted \n\naspect in the shape of faulting, slight folding and gravity-induced slides probably related to \n\nthe Cenozoic tectonism (Murillas et al., 1990). Seismic Unit 1 is locally characterized by \n\ncomplex facies associated with cut-and-fill features, slope instabilities and deformed \n\ndeposits close to the structural highs and escarpments (Ercilla et al., 2008). \n\n \n\nSeismic Unit 2 \n\nSeismic Unit 2 (Senoniam to Middle Eocene) corresponds to the claystones, marls rich in \n\nnanno-fossils and pelagites drilled at DSDP site 398 (Sibuet et al., 1979). Seismic Unit 2 \n\nis the sole seismic unit of the margin identified by its commom character throughout the \n\nWest Galicia margin (Moungenot, 1998). In the deeper part of the GIB and in the upper \n\ncontinental slope, Seismic Unit 2 drapes over the topography showing a constant \n\nthickness of 0.2s (TWT), and a velocity of about 2.8km/s. In most of the Western part of \n\nthe Galicia margin, the thickness of this formation can vary between 0.1s to 0.2s (TWT). It \n\nis characterized by a stratigraphic gap in its base marked by the formation of a prominent \n\nregional unconformity (Sibuet and Ryan, 1979). Acoustically, Seismic Unit 2 is \n\ncharacterized by continuous and discontinuous reflections with relatively high lateral \n\ncontinuity and high amplitude. This seismic unit is locally characterized by complex facies \n\ndue to the cut-and-fill features, internal erosive surfaces, and deformed and mobilized \n\nsediments (Ercilla et al., 2008). The internal reflections of this Seismic Unit have \n\nsubparallel, lenticular, and divergent configurations. Seismic Unit 2 sometimes onlaps \n\nSeismic Unit 3. Seismic Unit 2 and Seismic Unit 1 are separated, in some places, by an \n\nerosional unconformity very channeled which can reach 0.5s TWT in depth (Sangree and \n\nWidmier, 1977). \n\n \n\nSeismic Unit 3 \n\nAn important stratigraphic gap, attributed to deep oceanic circulation in the northern \n\nAtlantic, separates the Albian \u201cblack shales\u201d (Formation 3) from the Campanian to Eocene \n\npelagic sediments (Formation 2) at DSDP site 398 (Sibuet et al., 1979). Seismic Unit 3 \n\ndrapes, onlaps and downlaps the horst-and-graben paleotopography and locally infill it. \n\nThe onlaping of this Seismic Unit on the previous deposits indicates a deposition without \n\nsignificant tectonism (Murillas et al., 1990). This seismic unit shows a variable thickness \n\n\n\nChapter II. Geological Setting of the Study Area \n\n23 \n \n\n(few to 220ms, in TWT) and an irregular distribution throughout the West Galicia margin. \n\nSeismic Unit 3 is characterized by transparent to semi-transparent facies with stratified \n\nreflections of short lateral continuity and variable amplitudes. Around the structural highs \n\nand escarpments there is evidence of chaotic facies associated with cut-and-fill features, \n\ndeformed and sliding sediments (Ercilla et al., 2008). In the Transitional Zone, Galicia \n\nBank and in the northern GIB lateral changes in the seismic facies are observed, varying \n\nfrom transparent to diffractive, possibly associated with tectonic deformation between the \n\nCenozoic (Murillas et al., 1990). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure II.8 \u2013 Seismic profile GAP-015 acquired along the Galicia Interior Basin. The two arrows \nrepresent progradational patterns within the Seismic Unit 3 and sequence 1B (in Murillas et al., \n\n1990). Vertical scale is in TWT(s). \n\n \n\nSeismic Unit 4 \n\nSeismic Unit 4 (Hauterivian to late Aptian) was described as syn-and post-rift deposits of \n\nturbidite sandstones and siltstones with intercalations of clays and marls, with a variable \n\nthickness between few to 375ms (TWT) and with a seismic velocity of about 3.8 km/s. \n\nThis seismic unit infills the grabens and locally covers the buried horst-and-graben \n\nstructures of the acoustic basement in the Galicia Bank, Transitional Zone and Galicia \n\nInterior Basin (Ercilla et al, 2008). The configurations of the infilling reflections are \n\nclassified as subparalell, oblique and divergent. This seismic unit is classified as having a \n\ntransparent and often chaotic, facies with reflections of short lateral continuity with low \n\namplitude. Seismic Unit 3 shows pinch-outs against horsts, structural highs and \n\nescarpments. Its upper limit is defined by a strong reflection which corresponds to the \n\nlatest Aptian break-up unconformity (Murillas et al., 1990). This Seismic Unit does not \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n24 \n \n\nshow much evidence of relevant tectonic activity during its deposition (Murillas et al., \n\n1990). \n\n \n\nSeismic Unit 5 \n\nSeismic Unit 5 (Valanginian) has been classified as a syn-rift unit with a seismic velocity of \n\nabout 4.7 km/s. It consists of sandstones and claystones, confirmed by drilling at ODP \n\nSite 638 (Boillot et al., 1987). The seismic facies of Seismic Unit 5 can be classified as \n\nnearly transparent, diffractive, or distorted, with high amplitude and low-frequency \n\nreflections. This Seismic Unit is separated from Seismic Unit 4 by a strong unconformity \n\n(Murillas et al., 1990). In several places, at the foot of fault scarps, there is evidence of \n\nsedimentary wedges with chaotic internal configurations. These wedges, interpreted by \n\nMurillas et al. (1990) as gravitational slides contemporaneous with Seismic Unit 5, overlie \n\nSeismic Unit 6 and are overlapped by Seismic Unit 4. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure II.9 - Single channel seismic profile S4 with details of the seismic stratigraphy defined for \nthe Galicia Bank region (from Ercilla et al., 2008). \n\n \n\nSeismic Unit 6 \n\nSeismic Unit 6 was primarily defined by Mauffret and Montadert (1987) as a group of \n\nreflections with high amplitude, low-frequency and moderate continuity, from Late Jurassic \n\nperiod (Tithonian to Berriasian). The seismic velocity in this formation is about 5.4km/s. \n\nSimilar facies have been found within the GIB affected by intense faulting.

Mauffret and Montadert (1987) identified a thick transparent or chaotic interval \n\nunderlying Seismic Unit 6, which was interpreted as an Upper Jurassic sedimentary layer \n\ndeposited during an Oxfordian-Kimmeridgian extensional episode. Murillas et al. (1990) \n\nalso identified some deeper seismic events probably indicating the presence of older \n\nsedimentary layers, and proposed three possible interpretations for this group of \n\nreflections: (1) sedimentary sequences from Lower and Middle Jurassic or even from \n\nTriassic; (2) Paleozoic sediments; (3) intrabasement features of a non-sedimentary origin, \n\nsuch as thrusting faults or detachment faults. \n\n \n\nAcoustic Basement \n\nThe acoustic basement is characterized by an irregular and diffractive surface, strongly \n\nfractured, which forms tilted blocks, sometimes with the upper part flat due to erosion \n\nprocesses (Mauffret and Montadert, 1987). \n\n \n\nII. 4 The Gran Burato Structure \n\nDuring the ERGAP 1 and ERGAP 2 scientific cruises (V\u00e1zquez et al., 2009) multibeam \n\nbathymetry and seismic data were acquired in the Galicia continental slope southeast of \n\nthe Galicia Bank which permitted the recognition and study of three large depressions (A, \n\nB and C). These depression are circular in shape with heights between 100-370m and \n\nwhose size range between 3000 and 5000m (V\u00e1zquez et al., 2009). Among these three \n\nfeatures, there is the called BURATO ERGAP or Gran Burato (Figure II.10). These \n\nstructures are located in water depths between 1600m and 1850m. \n\nThe Gran Burato, or the BURATO ERGAP was first described as one of the most singular \n\nstructures on the West Galicia continental margin, and it has been studied in more detail, \n\nmore recently, by V\u00e1zquez et al (2009), Rey et al. (in prep.) and Pinheiro et al. (in prep). \n\nV\u00e1zquez et al. (2009) described and classified this depression as an erosive feature in U-\n\nV shape (transversal section), showing a symmetric section in SW-NE and asymmetrical \n\nin W-E direction. The flanks are truncation surfaces which provokes erosion of the \n\nSeismic Unit 1 and Seismic Unit 2. The bottom surface shows very strong reflections with \n\nchaotic and discontinuous stratified facies. According to V\u00e1zquez et al. (2009) this \n\ndepression is situated on top of a small diapir that rises between 800 to 1000ms (TWT), \n\nand according to the same authors, the material that forms this diapir seems to be the \n\n\n\nChapter II.

Possibly, this feature is similar to a \n\npockmark which the fluid escape is coming from that seismic unit. In both sides of the \n\ndepression is observed an intense normal faulting, which affects the seabottom \n\ntopography. On the west side of the Gran Burato, acoustic anomalies and transparent \n\ncolumnar facies interpreted on the seismic sections could indicate fluid venting (V\u00e1zquez \n\net al., 2009). \n\n \n\nFigure II.10 \u2013 High resolution multichannel seismic line ERGAP \u2013 C21 acquired during the ERGAP \ncruise where it is visible the Gran Burato. 1, 2 and 3 correspond to the seismic units defined by \nErcilla et al.

(2009) the genesis of these singular structure must be \n\nexplained in the framework of the Cenozoic Pyrenean compressive events, where faulting \n\nof the sedimentary cover over a viscous shale layer among other factors can be invoked \n\nto explain this impressive feature. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n28 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n29 \n \n\nChapter III. The 2D Marine Seismic Reflection Method \n \n\n \n\nThe first seismic survey was carried out in the early 1920s (Dobrin and Savit, 1988), as \n\nthe natural development of the long-established methods of earthquake seismology, in \n\nwhich the travel times of earthquake waves recorded at seismological observatories were \n\nused to study the internal structure of Earth, providing information about it composition \n\nand constitution. In the same way, but in a smaller scale, seismic surveying provides a \n\nclear and uniquely detailed picture of the subsurface geology. It is nowadays the most \n\nimportant geophysical surveying method, not only in terms of the amount of current survey \n\nactivity but also due to its wide range of applications. \n\nSeismic methods are widely applied to exploration problems involving, for example, to \n\nmap the subsurface regional geology, but also to map the geometry of layered \n\nsedimentary sequences and in the search for oil and gas. These methods can also be \n\nused, in a smaller scale, for the study of near-surface geology (using high resolution \n\nmethods), determining the location of the water table and site geotechnical investigation of \n\nfoundations conditions including the determination of the bedrock depth.  \n\nSeismic surveying can be carried out on land (onshore environments) and at sea (marine \n\nenvironments). Nowadays, 2D and 3D multichannel seismic reflection are extensively \n\nused offshore in the search for oil and gas. \n\n \n\nIII. 1 Basic Principles and Fundamentals \n\nIn the seismic reflection method, the structure of the subsurface geological formations is \n\nmapped by measuring the time required for a seismic wave (or pulse) emitted at or near \n\nsurface to return to the surface after reflection on the interfaces between formations, \n\nwhich have different physical and acoustically properties. The incident wave is split into a \n\nreflected part that travels upward and a refracted part that continues to propagate \n\ndownward in a slightly different direction (with a different angle), according to the Snell\u2019s \n\nLaw (Equation 1). \n\n \n\n        \n\n        \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  (Eq.1) \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n30 \n \n\nwhere    is the incident angle,    is the refracted angle, and V1 and V2 represent the \n\nvelocity of the seismic waves in two different medias. Figure III.1 shows the behavior of \n\nseismic waves at a layer boundary, such as a bedding plane, assuming there is no wave \n\nmode conversion. \n\n \n\nFigure III.1 \u2013 Partial reflection and partial refraction of the seismic wave between two media with \ndifferent physical properties for the simplified case in which there is no wave mode conversion. Vi \nand ?i represents the velocity of the seismic waves and the density of the layers, respectively. In \nthe wave general case, for non-normal incidence, there will be wave mode conversion at the \ninterface and longitudinal waves (P-waves) are converted to shear waves (S-waves) and vice-\nversa. \n\n \n\nThe time that the reflected waves take to travel since the source until the receivers, where \n\nthey are recorded, is used to derive information about the subsurface geology, as well as \n\nthe rock properties and layers attitude. The two-way travel-time (TWT), is the time that a \n\nwave takes to travel since it is generated at the source, finds an interface between two \n\nlayers with different density (?), seismic wave velocity (V), i.e. with a contrast of acoustic \n\nimpedance\n3\n (Z), where it is reflected, and travels back to the surface where it is recorded \n\nby the receivers. The Reflection Coefficient (RC) is proportional to the contrast between \n\nthe acoustic impedance and is given by (Equation 2; only valid for normal incidence): \n\n \n\n   \n          \n          \n\n  \n      \n      \n\n \n\nIn seismic reflection data, usually there is only one data set available and its fundamental \n\nproperties, like resolution, are largely determined by the acquisition parameters and by the \n\n                                                \n3\n - Seismic velocity multiplied by densisty. Reflection coefficient at normal incidence depends on \n\nchanges in acoustic impedance (Sheriff, 1991). \n\n(Eq.2) \n\n\n\nChapter III.

Therefore, seismic resolution is a matter of prime importance in \n\nseismic data acquisition (Yilmaz, 2001a). \n\nVertical resolution \n\nThe vertical resolution of a seismic wave (Figure III.2) is a measure of its ability to \n\nrecognize individual, closely-spaced reflectors and is determined by the pulse length of \n\nthe record seismic section. The vertical resolution increases with increasing wave \n\nfrequency. Frequency is expressed as number of cycles per second (1cycle/s = 1Hertz) \n\nand higher frequencies means sharper pulses and therefore better resolution. Two \n\nreflectors, such as the top and the base of a stratigraphic unit, can be recognized as \n\nseparated seismic events only if the distance between them is at least \u00bc of wavelength (?) \n\nof the seismic wavelet, defined by (Equation 3):  \n\n  \n\n   \n \n\n \n  \n\n \n\nwhere V is the seismic wave velocity in the layer and f is frequency.  \n\n \n\nFigure III.2 - Vertical scale of a seismic wavelet: a) A single cycle wave of 30 Hz in medium \nvelocity of 1830m/s; b) The Big Ben, London, 115 meters (modified from McQuillin et al., 1984). \n\n(Eq.3) \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n32 \n \n\nThe frequency of waves transmitted into the Earth depends on the type and \n\ncharacteristics of the seismic source. However, the frequency changes as the waves \n\ntravel in the subsurface and the seismic wave will lose higher frequencies in depth since \n\nthey are more rapidly absorved. Therefore, high-frequencies waves are attenuated much \n\nfaster than low-frequencies. The higher the frequency the lower will be the penetration, \n\nbut the higher will be the vertical resolution. \n\n \n\nHorizontal resolution \n\nThe horizontal resolution of a seismic wave is mainly controlled by the so-called \u201c1\nst\n \n\nFresnel Zone\u201d (Figure III.3; Figure III. 4). The Huygen\u2019s principle states that each part of a \n\nwavefront acts as a source of a new wave and the area where the waves interfere with \n\neach other constructively is the area of interest, called the \u201cFirst Fresnel Zone\u201d (Sheriff, \n\n1991,1996). The reflected waves will interfere constructively where their travel paths differ \n\nby less than a half wavelength. Beyond this First Fresnel Zone region interference will be \n\nalternatively destructive and constructive. In other words, a reflection that is coming back \n\nto the surface is being reflected not froim a reflector point, but from an area with the \n\ndimension of the First Fresnel Zone. The radius of the 1\nst\n Fresnel Zone depends on the \n\nseismic velocity (V), the depth of the target (t, in TWT) and the frequency of the seismic \n\nsignal (f) (Equation 4; Sherrif and Geldart, 1995; Sheriff, 1996). \n\n \n\nFigure III.3 \u2013 Schematic representation of the 1\nst\n Fresnel Zone. The energy is returned to the \n\nreceiver from all points of the reflector. The part of the reflector which the energy is reflected within \nhalf of wavelength of the initial reflected arrival is known as the1st Fresnel zone (Kearey and \nBrooks, 1991). \n\n\n\nChapter III. The 2D Marine Seismic Reflection Method  \n\n33 \n \n\nThe dimensions of the Fresnel Zone can be easily calculated by simple geometry as \n\nshown in Figure III. 4a, for the case of a plane reflector in case of constant velocity and \n\nwith two-way travel time.  \n\n \n\nFigure III. 4 \u2013 a) Calculation of the radius of the Fresnel Zone using the pythagorean theorem; b) \nnomogram for determining the Fresnel Zone radius. A straight line connecting the two-way time \nand frequency intersects the central line at the same point as a line connecting the average velocity \nand the Fresnel Zone radius (in Sheriff, 1996).  \n\n \n\nThe radius of the First Fresnel Zone, FR, is given by (Equation 4): \n\n \n\n   \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nwhere V is the average seismic velocity on the layer, t is the wave two-way travel-time, \n\nand f is the frequency of the seismic waves. Thus, the Fresnel zone increases, and \n\n(Eq.4) \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n34 \n \n\nconsequently horizontal resolution decreases, with increasing velocity, increasing travel-\n\ntime (depth) and decreasing signal frequency. \n\n \n\nIII. 2 2D Multichannel Seismic Reflection Surveys \n\nIn the 2D multichannel marine seismic acquisition (Figure III.5) a long seismic streamer of \n\nhydrophones and a seismic wave source are towed behind the seismic vessel. The \n\nstreamer will be the receiver of the reflected waves that come from the sea subsurface, \n\nand convert them to an electrical signal. The reflections from the subsurface are assumed \n\nto come directly from  below the navigation line performed by the research vessel.  \n\n2D seismic lines are typically acquired several kilometers apart, on a broad grid of lines, \n\nover a large area to image the subsurface geology with good penetration and to look for \n\npotential hydrocarbon traps. In exploration areas, 2D multichannel seismic surveys are \n\nalways carried out before a 3D survey is planned and executed, and before drilling, to \n\nobtain a general understanding of the regional geological structure of the area of interest. \n\n \n\nFigure III.5 \u2013 Typical seismic survey design (modified from http://www.ocean.slb.com). \n\n \n\nIn general, a seismic acquisition system (Figure III.5) is always composed of (i) a seismic \n\nwave source that generates the acoustic pulse; (ii) cable or streamer of hydrophones \n\n\n\nChapter III. The 2D Marine Seismic Reflection Method  \n\n35 \n \n\n(group of receivers) which receives the reflected seismic waves; iii) a recording digital \n\nsystem; (iv) amplifiers; (iv) filters; and (v) analog-digital-convertes (ADC) to convert the \n\nanalog signal to digital (McQuillin et al., 1984; Telford et al., 1990). \n\n \n\nIII.2.1 Marine Seismic Sources \n\nDuring the first seismic reflection surveys at sea the seismic wave source was chemical \n\nexplosives. For environmental reasons, this methodology was discontinued, and now \n\nthere is a wide variety of marine seismic sources, all capable of producing large amounts \n\nof energy, similar to explosive sources. \n\nFor continuous seismic profiling, acoustic sources have been designed to produce a \n\nintense short duration burst of sound, or in other words, a source signal as close as \n\npossible to a spike. Seismic sources for multichannel reflection surveys at sea are \n\ndesigned to have a very high acoustic energy output, especially in the frequency band \n\nbetween 20 and 200Hz (McQuillin and Ardus, 1977).  \n\nThe most widely-used seismic sources in multichannel seismic (MCS) surveys, which \n\nwere also used in the BURATO4240 survey, are the airguns (Figure III.6; Figure III.7). The \n\nairguns are devices that release a high pressure bubble of compressed air underwater \n\nthat acts as a source of energy to generate the acoustic/pressure waves that are used in \n\nseismic reflection surveys. During the charging cycle, air at high pressure is fed into the \n\nupper chamber and bleeds through the hollow piston into the lower chamber (Figure III.6). \n\nTo fire the gun, an electrical pulse (electrical triggering) opens the solenoid valve and a \n\nslug of high pressure air is delivered to the underside of the trigger position. The piston \n\nshoots upward under the pressure exerted by the compressed air releasing the air in the \n\nlower chamber into the water. Pressure in the upper chamber then drives the piston back \n\nto its initial position and the charging cycle recommences. During a period of a few \n\nmilliseconds, all the high pressure air in the lower chamber is suddenly released into the \n\nsurrounding water through centrally located ports, and it is the explosive release of this air \n\nwhich provides energy for the initial pulse. This release of high pressure air creates an air \n\nbubble quite similar to that from a dynamite explosion and gives rise to a repetitive bubble \n\npulses at a rate determined by the oscillation period of the air mass thus generated: the \n\nlarger the volume of the air, the longer the period (Dobrin and Savit, 1988).  \n\nThe dominant frequency of a pulse generated by an airgun is controlled by the air \n\npressure, the size of the lower chamber, and by the depth of operation (McQuillin and \n\nArdus, 1977).  \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n36 \n \n\n \n\nFigure III.6 \u2013 Schematic representation of an airgun. During the charging cycle, air at high \npressure is fed into the upper chamber and bleeds through the hollow piston into the lower \nchamber (left image). To fire the gun, an electrical pulse opens the solenoid valve and a slug of \nhigh pressure air is delivered to the underside of the trigger position. The piston shoots upwards \nunder the pressure exerted on the firing piston releasing the air in the lower chamber into the water \n(right image) (modified from Dobrin and Savit, 1988; Telford et al., 1990). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure III.7 \u2013Array of 10 airguns used in the BURATO4240 scientific survey (for more details see \nChapter I \u2013Section I.4): a) deployment of the array of airguns; b) detail of the array showing 2 \nairguns. \n\n\n\nChapter III. The 2D Marine Seismic Reflection Method  \n\n37 \n \n\nThe primary pulse generated by an airgun is followed by a train of bubble pulses that \n\nincrease the overall length of the pulse (McQuillin et al., 1984; Dobrin and Savit, 1988, \n\nTelford et al., 1990). This effect is called the \u201cbubble effect\u201d and it gives an oscillatory and, \n\nunsatisfactory reflection record. Special measures are adopted in the design of the \n\nseismic array and in the individual airguns time shooting, as well in the processing stage \n\nto attenuate the bubble oscilations. Arrays of airguns of varying sizes and different bubble \n\npulse periods can be used to produce a high-energy source in which primary pulses \n\ninterfere constructively (Figure III.8). This technique will give a pulse which has a broad \n\nfrequency spectrum and has the main energy concentrated in the initial pressure pulse; \n\nthe bubble pulses will interfere destructively, so that a pulse as close as possible to a \n\nspike can be obtained (Figure III.8). The pressure signal actually recorded from the array \n\nwill consist of an impulse representing the sum of the initial pulses from all the guns \n\nfollowed by a train of much weaker. Special types of airguns, called GI-Guns were \n\nespecially designed to minimize this effect (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). \n\n \n\nFigure III.8 \u2013 Comparison of the source signatures of a single 4225cm\n3\n air gun (a) and seven \n\nairgun array with a total volume of 20000cm\n3\n (b). Note the suppression of the bubble pulse in b) \n\n(modified from Kearey and Brooks, 1991). \n\n \n\nA wide range of airgun chambers sizes is available, leading to different energy outputs \n\nand frequency characteristics. Using these types of seismic sources this system it is \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n38 \n \n\npossible to generate seismic waves with less environmental impacts, in safer conditions \n\n(in comparison with the explosive sources), to have continuous supply of compressed air \n\nby standard compressor equipment onboard a ship, and it is possible to programme the \n\ntriggering time with very high precision. Also, it is possible to fire all airguns in the array \n\nsimultaneously, or with small delays between them in order to get a sharper signal, which \n\nwill provide a better compressed seismic wavelet, and therefore provide higher seismic \n\nresolution. \n\n \n\nIII.2.2 Marine Seismic Receivers \n\nTo receive and record the seismic reflected waves a long hydrophone cable, called \n\nstreamer, is used (Figure III.9). The streamer cable, originally developed for \n\nantisubmarine warfare in World War II, is the most widely used type of seismic receiver for \n\nmodern seismic recording. This cable consists of a plastic tube, 5 to 8 cm in diameter, \n\nnearly neutrally buoyant and generally filled with querosene. In common practice, the \n\ncable is maintained at approximately 1% positive buoyancy so that, in case of cable loss, \n\nit will float to the surface. The hydrophone elements, wires and transformers are stored \n\ninside the plastic tube, which is acoustically transparent and generally also optically \n\ntransparent. Inside the tube there are also steel cables, the strain elements that provide \n\nthe mechanical strength to tow the entire length of the cable. The seismic wave passes \n\nthrough both the plastic tube and the oil and reaches the hydrophones without noticeable \n\ninterference (Dobrin and Savit, 1988).  \n\nThe principle of the marine hydrophone is quite simple. Within the hydrophone a \n\npiezoelectric transducer produces an electrical signal (voltage) in response to the \n\npressure changes caused by the passage through the surrounding water of the seismic \n\npressure waves. Each crystal element consists of an annular piezoelectric ring, metallic-\n\ncoated on both surfaces, bonded at the open ends by thin convex metallic diaphragms \n\n(Dobrin and Savit, 1988).  \n\nHydrophones are arranged in sections (\u201clive sections\u201d) and, in each one, there are, \n\ncommonly, at least twenty hydrophones spaced around 1m (Telford et al., 1990). Each \n\nhydrophone from each live section receives a seismic signal which is summed up together \n\nand the final result is considered the seismic record (seismic trace) for that live section, \n\nreceiver group or channel. With this summing (stacking) technique the signal to noise ratio \n\nis largely improved. \n\n\n\nChapter III. The 2D Marine Seismic Reflection Method  \n\n39 \n \n\n \n\nFigure III.9 \u2013 a) Hydrophone scheme; b) acceleration-cancelling hydrophone (in Reynolds, 1997). \n\n \n\nIn seismic reflection surveying with a long towed streamers substantial noise is generated \n\ndue to the vibration of the cable (strumming) and also by the vessel\u2019s movement \n\n(acceleration/deceleration) both of which are transmitted to the streamer. McQuillin et al. \n\n(1984) suggest several methods to reduce these noisy effects: \n\n1. Ship motion is decoupled from the streamer by using an elastic non-active lead-in \n\nsection; this absorbs the ship\u2019s heave motion allowing the cable to be towed at a \n\nconstant speed through the water; \n\n2. Streamer depths controller -\u201cbirds\u201d - are used to maintain a constant depth along \n\nthe length of the streamer; \n\n3.  Lead-in sections to the cable can be faired (rubber or tissue strips can be \n\nattached to it) to reduce noise induced by strumming; \n\n4. Instead of single crystal element hydrophones, dual crystal element hydrophones \n\nare used which have very low sensitivity to horizontal accelerations, one of the \n\nmain sources of noise problems. \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n40 \n \n\nThe streamer (Figure III.10; Figure III.11a) is divided in several components. Figure III.10 \n\nshows a common 480 channel streamer which is towed in actual size.  \n\n \n\nFigure III.10 \u2013 Scheme of a 480 channel streamer (modified from Telford et al., 1990). \n\n \n\nThe first component is a heavy armored lead-in-cable, usually about 200m long, from the \n\nship to the beginning of the neutrally buoyant streamer cable. The heavy, long, lead-in \n\ncable is used to depress the hydrophone cable to its operating depth and to provide some \n\nisolation from the pitching and tossing motion of the ship and from the noise of the ship\u2019s \n\nmachinery. Usually rubber strips or sheets, called fairings, are fastened to the forward part \n\nof the lead-in to cut down the turbulence that ordinarily follows an object towed \n\ntransversely through the water. After the lead-in of the streamer cable there is a section \n\ncalled a \u201cstretch\u201d section, or \u201cdead section\u201d, because usually contains no hydrophones \n\n(Sheriff and Geldart, 1995), and its stress components are made of nylon rope or similar \n\nresilient material. Much of the vibration that is not attenuated by lead-in is presumed to be \n\nabsorbed by the dead section. The last group of hydrophone is followed by another \n\ncompliant section and a tail buoy (Figure III.11b) which floats at the surface. This tail buoy \n\nserves to mark the end of the cable and is essential to recover a severed cable, to \n\ncalculate the positioning of the streamer and to reduce the drift of the streamer due to \n\nwater currents (e.g. McQuillin and Ardus, 1977; Dobrin and Savit, 1988; Sheriff and \n\nGeldart, 1995). \n\nAt suitable intervals along the streamer, 8 or 10 pressure-sensitive depth controllers or \n\n\u201cbirds\u201d are attached (Figure III.11c) to keep the cable at the optimum depth. Each unit \n\ncontains wings that lift or lower the cable, depending on the angle they make with the \n\nhorizontal (Dobrin and Savit, 1988). \n\n\n\nChapter III. The 2D Marine Seismic Reflection Method  \n\n41 \n \n\n \n\nFigure III.11 \u2013 Seismic acquisition equipment used during the BURATO4240 survey: a) streamer \n\non the ship deck; b) tail buoy; c) deployment of the streamer with a \u201cbird\u201d attached. \n\n \n\nAmong the benefits of using streamer incorporations, such as lead-in sections, as well as \n\nother noise-reducing design systems is that marine surveys can now be conducted at \n\nhigher tow speeds and in rougher weather conditions; also improved signal to noise ratio \n\nare obtained, which allow the geophysicist to get deeper information and better imaging \n\nafter data processing (Dobrin and Savit, 1988).  \n\n \n\nIII.2.3 Multi-Fold Coverage Marine Seismic Acquisition  \n\nThe quantity and quality of the primary seismic signals recorded at sea are affected by \n\nmany different types of background noise which can be conveniently described in two \n\nmain categories: random and coherent Much depends on field analysis and Quality \n\nControl (QC) and on the layout design of the seismic source and receivers (McQuillin et \n\nal., 1984). \n\nIn multichannel seismic survey, if the shot-receiver geometry is moved forward in such a \n\nway that no two reflected ray paths sample the same point on a subsurface reflector, the \n\nsurvey coverage is said to be single-fold, and each seismic trace represents a unique \n\nsampling of some point along the reflector.  \n\nThe most common design for multichannel 2D seismic aims at getting a multi-fold \n\ncoverage, where the reflections from each point along the reflector are recorded in more \n\nthan just one seismic trace, for different shots. Figure III.12 shows a typical marine \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n42 \n \n\nmultichannel acquisition system and illustrates how the data is acquired in a way which \n\nallows multifold coverage and consequently stacking during processing. The use of \n\nmultiple sources, multiple detectors per trace and the summing of common reflection point \n\ntraces (Figure III.12) brings a distinct improvement on the weakest source and even in the \n\nsignal to noise ratio (McQuillin et al., 1984). Before the implementation of multi-fold \n\ncoverage sums or mixes of the seismic traces were often performed successfully. The \n\nimprovement on the signal-to-noise ratio is proportional to ?n where n is the number of \n\ndetecting elements in the acquisition system (the signals which will be added together to \n\nprovide the final record; McQuillin et al., 1984).  \n\n \n\nFigure III.12 - Diagram showing the multichannel marine seismic acquisition geometry with multi-\nfold coverage technique (modified from McQuillin et al., 1984). \n\n \n\nMulti-fold coverage, which has been around over the last few decades, is now the \n\nstandard technique for 2D multichannel seismic surveying. The geometry of acquisition is \n\nset in a way that a set of traces recorded at different offsets for different shots contains \n\nreflections from a common midpoint (CMP) on the same reflector (Figure III.12; Figure \n\n\n\nChapter III. The 2D Marine Seismic Reflection Method  \n\n43 \n \n\nIII.13). A CMP is a point at the surface located at half-offset between the source and the \n\nreceiver that is common to several source-receiver pairs (Figure III.13).  \n\nIn Figure III.13b it is shown that the CMP gather is formed by all the traces from the \n\nsource-receiver (Si-Ri) pairs that correspond to the same commom reflections points. The \n\nfold refers to the number of traces in the CMP gather that can be summed, and can be \n\nexpressed as a percentage (e.g. single-fold = 100% fold coverage; six-fold = 600% fold \n\ncoverage) or by the number of times the same CMP is sampled (e.g. 20-fold; 60-fold). As \n\nsuch, the larger the fold the better will be the data quality. \n\n \n\nFigure III.13 - Shot-Receivers (Si-Ri) pairs that share the same reflection point: a) Si-Ri pairs \naccording to the geometry shown in the previous figure (modified from Kearey and Brooks, 1991); \nb) CMP gather for the first three S-R pairs (modified from www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com). \n\n \n\nThis method brings a significant improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio due to the \n\nstacking of n traces containing information about the same reflection point, and attenuates \n\nor can almost totally suppresses the long-path multiples that have a significantly different \n\nmoveout from the primary reflection (Yilmaz, 1987;Kearey and Brooks, 1991;Yilmaz, \n\n2001a). \n\n \n\nIII. 3 The Nature of Seismic Traces \n\nIn seismology, a seismic trace refers to the recorded curve from a single seismograph \n\nwhen measuring ground movement. The name comes from the curve plotted by a \n\nseismograph as the paper roll rotated and the needle left a trace from which information \n\nabout the subsurface could be extracted. Today's instruments record the data digitally and \n\nthe word trace corresponds to the digital signal. \n\nThe particular seismic trace shown in Figure III.14 represents several interfaces of variable \n\nimpedance contrast, two of which with negative reflection coefficient. A negative reflection \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n44 \n \n\ncoefficient occurs at a decrease in acoustic impedance across an interface; since density \n\nis generally quite slowly varying in regions in which exploration seismologists are \n\ninterested, this usually implies a decrease in acoustic velocity. The timing of the \n\nreflections from a specific interface will vary from trace to trace according to the average \n\nvelocity down to the interface, the depth of interface, and the offset between the source \n\nand the receiver. This reflection series determines the timing and relative strengths of the \n\nreflected seismic pulses. \n\n \n\nFigure III.14 \u2013 The reflection seismogram, or a seismic trace, viewed as the convolution of a \nreflectivity function with a source wavelet (modified from Kearey and Brooks, 1991). For more \ndetails see, for example, Sherriff and Geldart (1995) \u2013 Chapter 9, pps 279-285. \n\n \n\nIn practice, however,  the seismic trace also contains contributions of undesirable nature, \n\nin particular (Hatton et al., 1986): \n\n i Multiple reflections: \n\n ii Coherent noise; \n\n iii Random noise. \n\n \n\nMultiple reflections \n\nIn addition to the energy returning via a simple reflection, more complex ray paths are also \n\npossible as shown in Figure III.15. As reflection from more than one interface is involved, \n\nthese returns are collectively known as multiples (Hatton et al., 1986). For all but very \n\nshallow interfaces, for surveys using medium size streamers, and in areas of a thick water \n\ncolumn, it can be reasonably assumed that travel paths are vertical. The additional \n\n\n\nChapter III. The 2D Marine Seismic Reflection Method  \n\n45 \n \n\ndistance travelled along these multiple ray paths then result in a constant time delay, \n\nindependent of the receiver offset. \n\n \n\nFigure III.15 \u2013 Ray paths of some common multiples families (modified from Hatton et al., 1986). \n\n \n\nTwo classes of multiples: long-path multiples can be distinguished; and short-path multiple \n\n(Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). A long-path multiple is one whose travel path is long \n\ncompared with primary reflections from the same deep interfaces, and thus long-path \n\nmultiples appear as separate events on a seismic record. An examples is the simple \n\nseabottom multiple and inter-formational multiples. A short-path multiple on the other \n\nhand, arrives soon after the associated primary reflection so that it interferes with it and \n\nadds a tail to the primary reflection. This results in a change in the waveshape rather than \n\nproducing a separate event. Examples of short-path multiples are the near-surface \n\nmultiples, the ghosts, and some peg-leg multiples. Ghost reflections are originated by the \n\ndeep tow of the seismic source/receivers and produce a high amplitude pulse of negative \n\npolarity which follows closely behind the primary pulse, and interfere with it to produce one \n\na modified pulse. In practice, both source and receiver ghosts must be included  in the \n\nseismic wave signature (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). \n\n \n\nCoherent noise \n\nAccording to Hatton et al. (1986) examples of coherent noise are: \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n46 \n \n\n? Direct waves: energy travelling directly along the water, from the source to the \n\nreceiver array. \n\n? Diffracted waves: energy scattered in all directions from a point scattering, not \n\nnecessarily located in the plane of the survey; \n\n? Refracted waves: energy striking an interface at the critical angle; \n\n? Vibrational noise: energy resulting from tug of the boat and the tail buoy on the \n\ncable in roughish seas, as well as boat noise including source generated noise: \n\n? Interference: energy generated by other vessels; even a 100 km away vessel \n\ncould generate noise. \n\nThe common characteristic of this kind of noise is the line-up of energy in a \n\ndistinguishable manner across the traces of a shot gather (Larner et al., 1983). Two-\n\ndimensional filtering techniques can be applied to attempt their attenuation. \n\n \n\nRandom noise \n\nRandon noise exhibits no correlation from trace to trace, and no specific noise amplitude \n\ncan be predicted from the knowledge of the generating mechanism. It can be generated \n\nby: \n\n? Instrument noise: thermal motion of electrons in recording equioment electronics; \n\ninterference; \n\n? Machinery: compressors and other heavy machinery; \n\n? Power lines: normally 50Hz or 60Hz can be picked up from the seismic vessel; \n\n? Cable noise: motion of the streamer through the water. \n\nImprovements in the design of seismic vessels, instruments and cables are continually \n\nreducing the effect of the various types of noise described above. Methods of random \n\nnoise reduction are based on averaging techniques and frequency filtering (Hatton et al., \n\n1986). \n\n \n\nIII. 4 Basic Seismic Data Processing \n\nStandard seismic processing flows are completely implemented and well known in the \n\nindustry to increase the seismic vertical resolution, improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the \n\ndata, and to display the seismic events in their correct spatial position, in order to obtain a \n\nbetter imaging of the desired geological information contained in the seismic data \n\n\n\nChapter III. The 2D Marine Seismic Reflection Method  \n\n47 \n \n\n(McQuillin et al., 1984; Dobrin and Savit, 1988; Kearey and Brooks, 1991;Yilmaz, \n\n2001a,b). \n\nA common simple processing flow for 2D seismic data is ordinarilly composed of a \n\npreprocessing stage with demultiplexing, trace editing, amplitude and geometry \n\ncorrections, and it is followed by a processing sequence which normally includes: \n\ndeconvolution, CMP sorting, velocity analysis, normal moveout correction, CMP stack and \n\nmigration (Yilmaz, 2001a). \n\nField seismic data normally are recorded in multiplexed format because that is the way the \n\nsampling is usually done during the data acquisition \u2013 successive samples on the tape \n\nrepresents the succession of channels at the same instant in time (Dobrin and Savit, \n\n1988). So, in general, the early stages of processing require channel-ordered or trace-\n\nordered data. Demultiplex is the first step in processing, in a way to convert the data into a \n\norganized and usable file format for the next processing steps. The conventional standard \n\nfile format for seismic files, in oil and gas industry, is SEG-Y (Yilmaz, 2001a). \n\nAs mentioned before, the preprocessing stage also includes trace editing which consists \n\non the correction or deleting of the noisy or polarity reversed traces. The marine data are \n\nmost of the times contaminated with very low frequency noise due to swell and to \n\nmovements of the streamer. This noise can be easily removed with the application of low-\n\ncut filters. However, if these effects are still observed in some traces, even after apply the \n\nfilter, the common practice is delete them, otherwise they will decrease the signal-to-noise \n\nratio of the seismic data (Yilmaz, 2001a). \n\nFollowing the demultiplexing and trace edit steps, amplitude adjustments are performed in \n\norder to correct the amplitude decay with time due to spherical divergence and energy \n\ndissipation in the Earth. The spherical divergence correction is a spatially averaged \n\nvelocity function which is applied to compensate the effects of spherical wavefront \n\ndivergence. Additionally, a gain function is sometimes used to compensate for attenuation \n\nlosses. Finally, the seismic data is adjusted with the acquisition geometry used in the field, \n\ni.e. the data is corrected for the position of shots and receivers, and the true position are \n\nstored on trace headers. Many types of processing problems arise at later stages due to \n\nthe wrong setting up of the field geometry, and as a result the stacked profiles can be \n\nseverely degraded (Yilmaz, 2001a). \n\nAfter finished the preprocessing phase the seismic processing proceeds to a \n\ndeconvolution. The aim of this step is the improvement of the vertical resolution by \n\ncompressing the source wavelet. Deconvolution is the inverse filtering technique used to \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n48 \n \n\ncompress an oscillatory (long) source waveform, often seen on marine data, into a spike \n\n(unit-impulse function) as closest as possible. Ghosts, seafloor multiples, and near-\n\nsurface reverberations can often be attenuated through deconvolution approaches. Many \n\ndeconvolution techniques use the autocorrelation of the trace to design an inverse \n\noperator that removes undesirable and predictable energy (Dobrin and Savit, 1988). \n\nVelocity analysis is performed on selected CMP gathers or group of gathers \n\n(SuperGathers). The output from the velocity analysis is a table of numbers as a function \n\nof velocity versus two-way zero-offset time (velocity spectrum). The velocity model is then \n\nused to correct the normal moveout (NMO) of the CMP gathers. The NMO correction \n\nremoves the source-receiver offset in a non-dipping reflector, assuming that the reflection \n\ntravel-time, itself a function of offset, follows a hyperbolic trajectory (Figure III.16a;b). After \n\nNMO correction the seismic events displayed on a CMP gather are mostly flattened \n\nacross the offset range (Figure III.16b; Yilmaz, 2001a). \n\nThe common midpoint (CMP) stack is the data-compression technique generally used. \n\nAfter a detailed velocity analysis and after the NMO corrections, the seismic traces in \n\neach CMP gather are summed to form a stacked trace at each midpoint location - CMP \n\nstacking (Figure III.16c). This process will increase the signal-to-noise ratio, will also \n\nattenuates noise such as multiples and ground roll, because reflected signal and coherent \n\nnoise usually have different stacking velocities (Yilmaz, 2001a). \n\nFigure III.16 \u2013 Sorted seismic traces by CMP and NMO corrections: a) Sorted CMP gathers; every \nSi-Ri that corresponds to the same reflection point; b) CMP gather after performed the NMO \ncorrections; c) stacked trace with a better signal (modified from http://www.gsj.go.jp). \n\n \n\nThe last step of a common processing flow is the migration. If a realistic velocity model is \n\ncalculated, the migration process will move the dipping events into their supposedly true \n\nsubsurface positions, will collapse the diffractions, will increase the spatial resolution; and \n\n\n\nChapter III. The 2D Marine Seismic Reflection Method  \n\n49 \n \n\ncorrects amplitudes for geometric focusing effects and spatial smearing (Dobrin and Savit, \n\n1988; Yilmaz, 2001a). This process can be applied before the stack (pre-stack migration) \n\nor after it (post-stack migration). The pre-stack migration will be a more time-consumer \n\nand a heavy computation process, but in many cases it increases the vertical resolution of \n\nthe seismic section. The algorithm is applied trace to trace at each CMP location, instead \n\nof being applied to the stacked data (Yilmaz, 2001a). \n\nAll the processing steps should be quality controlled through the seismic processing job in \n\norder to ensure that the quality of the data is not diminishing during the seismic data \n\nprocessing (Yilmaz, 2001a,b). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n50 \n \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n51 \n \n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of \nthe BURATO4240 Survey \n\n \n\n \n\nIn the scope of this thesis, the 2D multichannel seismic data acquired during the \n\nBURATO4240 survey was processed in order to improve the onboard preliminary seismic \n\nprocessing with a more carefully and detailed processing flow, particularly in the velocity \n\nanalysis, stack and migration steps. One of the main objectives of the new processing \n\nwas to increase the overall quality of all the acquired seismic sections with a better \n\nimaging, in particular, of the basement and deeper seismic reflectors. This enhancement \n\nwas mainly achieved by the introduction of a pre-stack time migration step into the \n\nprocessing flow. The re-processed seismic lines allowed a better constrained \n\ninterpretation of the subsurface geology. \n\nThe onboard preliminary processing of the seismic data consisted of a short and fast \n\nsequence of steps with a very simplistic pos-stack migration velocity model. This \n\npreliminary processing was performed onboard using the ProMAX software, from \n\nLandmark, which allowed the geophysical team to do a fast and satisfactory preliminary \n\nprocessing. One objective of this onboard preliminary processing was to assist the \n\ndecisions concerning the bottom sampling which would be done during the LEG-2 \n\n(Seabottom Sampling) of the BURATO4240 survey. \n\nThe second stage of the seismic processing was performed after the cruise, at the Marine \n\nGeology and Geophysics Laboratory of the Geosciences Department of the University of \n\nAveiro with the collaboration of Dr. Dan Herold and Dr. Matthew Rawlston from Parallel \n\nGeoscience Corporation. In this stage, a more carefully and detailed processing flow was \n\nbuilt using the Seismic Processing Workshop software (SPW), from Parallel Geoscience \n\nCorporation. The new processing flow includes, among other improvements, a processing \n\nstep for multiple removal/attenuation and a more detailed velocity analysis. This new \n\ndetailed velocity model was used as input for a pre-stack time migration of the most \n\nrepresentative seismic lines. \n\n \n\nIV. 1 Acquisition Parameters \n\nIn seismic data processing, the reliable information concerning the parameters related \n\nwith the acquisition geometry and the characteristics of the seismic sources and receivers \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n52 \n \n\nused is essential to correctly parameterize the various processing steps. The correct \n\ndefinition of the acquisition parameters is fundamental to obtain a good and accurate \n\nprocessed seismic profile. An example is the assignment of the acquisition geometry. \n\nParameters such as the shooting interval, the channel spacing and the Source-Receiver \n\nOffset, are extremely important since without them, the seismic processing cannot be \n\ncorrectly performed.  \n\nBesides the parameters already mentioned above, the seismic processor also needs to \n\nknow the the sampling interval and the record length of the acquisition system. As the \n\nseismic source and the seismic receivers are towed below the sea surface their tow-depth \n\nare also required to correct for the statics. \n\nIn some cases, where the streamer does not have included a GPS antenna to record its \n\npositioning during the acquisition, and the only positioning data available is from the GPS \n\nantenna of the vessel (often at close to it center), is necessary to calculate the offsets \n\nbetween all the seismic acquisition equipments and the GPS antenna, in order to place \n\nthe acquired seismic profile at its right location. The repositioning of the seismic lines can \n\nbe done within a dedicated seismic processing software or even in a interpretation \n\npackage, such as Kingdom Suite. \n\nDuring the BURATO4240 scientific cruise all the above mentioned acquisition parameters \n\nwere confirmed and registered. They are schematically represented in Figure IV.1, and \n\nsummarized in Table IV.1 \n\n \n\nFigure IV.1 \u2013 Schematic multichannel seismic acquisition geometry adopted on the BURATO4240 \n\nscientific survey; S \u2013 seismic source; Ci \u2013 channel number (not to scale). \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n53 \n \n\nTable IV.1 \u2013 Seismic Acquisition Parameters. \n\nAcquisition Parameters \n\nSeismic Source \n  \nComposed of 5 arrays of 2 airguns each (10 airguns in total; 1840c.i.) towed at 7m water depth. The shooting interval \nwas 50m and the distance between the stern and seismic source were 30m  \n \n\nSeismic Receiver  \n  \nThe solid state streamer was towed at 7.5m water depth. The streamer used had 156 channels, spaced every 12.5m \nwith 12 channels per section. The record length was 10 seconds (TWT) at 1 or 2ms sampling interval, depending on the \nprofile. \n \n\nSource / Receiver Offset \n  \nThe offset between the source and the receiver was 186.7m along-track and 11.5m cross-track. The GPS antenna was \n81.5m away from the seismic source and 268.2m away from the 1\n\nst\n receiver group. \n\n \n\nShip\u2019s acquisition speed (approximate) 4 knots (2m/s) \n\n \n\nAnother important topic, dependent of the acquisition geometry is the fold. As explained in \n\nthe Chapter III, the fold refers to how many times a point on a reflector is sampled by \n\ndifferent Source-Receiver pairs, or in other words, how many seismic traces correspond to \n\nthe same midpoint location. The larger the fold value the better will be the signal-to-noise \n\nratio and therefore more constrained will be the velocity determination and better the \n\nsubsurface imaging. \n\nAs the seismic acquisition was carried out with multi-fold coverage there is more than just \n\none seismic trace per location. The fold diagram can be easily calculated on the SPW \n\nsoftware. The geometry of each seismic file (that corresponds to a single seismic line) \n\nmust be assigned and inserted into the corresponding trace header locations (see Section \n\nIV.3.3 Flow1). The geometry needs to be carefully defined first since the process called \n\nCMP Fold extracts the CMP locations, which are derived from the geometry definition, in \n\nthe seismic trace headers (Figure IV.2).  \n\n \n\nFigure IV.2 \u2013 SPW processing flow used to calculate the seismic fold. \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n54 \n \n\nA fold diagram for two seismic lines is presented in Figure IV.3. From this figure, we can \n\nconclude that the maximum fold number for the seismic lines used for this works is 20, \n\nwhich is not very high, due to limitations of the compressors during the seismic \n\nacquisition. As expected, the fold value is larger in the central part of the seismic line \n\nwhen compared with the edges. \n\n \n\nFigure IV.3 \u2013 Fold coverage along two seismic profiles: GB-23 (upper image) and GB-32 (lower \n\nimage). As expected, at the edges, the fold is lower than in the middle of the seismic section. \n\n \n\nIV. 2 Preliminary Onboard Data Processing \n\nPreliminary seismic data processing of all the 2D multichannel seismic lines acquired \n\nduring the BURATO4240 survey was performed onboard during the acquisition cruise, \n\nusing the ProMAX software (Seismic Data Processing Software - Landmark). This \n\npreliminary processing was performed by the geophysical team headed by Prof. L. M. \n\nPinheiro (University of Aveiro) which included R. Alpiste (University of Granada), H. \n\nDuarte (LNEG \u2013 National Laboratory of Energy and Geology), L. Azevedo (University of \n\nAveiro/IST) and the author of this thesis (University of Aveiro). A brief description of the \n\nprocessing adopted flow is presented below. \n\n \n\nIV.2.1 The ProMAX Software \n\nThe ProMAX interactive seismic data processing is a software developed by Landmark \u2013 \n\nHalliburton, which combines an easy data management environment, effective analysis \n\ntools, excellent processing algorithms, and productivity tools.  \n\nFor MCS processing purposes Landmark offers several products: ProMAX 2D, ProMAX \n\n3D, ProMAX VSP, ProMAX MVA, 3DPSDM (3D Prestack Depth Migration), Crooked Line, \n\nand ProMAX 4D. For this work, during the acquisition cruise, only the ProMAX 2D module \n\nwas used. \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n55 \n \n\nThe ProMAX 2D seismic processing system was first introduced in 1989, and has grown \n\ninto a UNIX workstation-based, for interactive and batch analysis and processing of 2D \n\nseismic data. It consists of several applications, both disk-based and tape-to-tape \n\ninput/output, and includes parallel processing capabilities. \n\nThe ProMAX 2D desktop window can be divided in three main domains (Figure IV.4):  \n\n? The Work Tree, where the user has all the information about the flow, datasets, \n\nand all the files created during the processing job; \n\n? The Flow Editor; where the user can build the processing flows and run them;  \n\n? The Processing List, which has all the available processing steps that can be used \n\nand linked together to build a processing flow. \n\n \n\nFigure IV.4 \u2013 ProMAX 2D window. \n\n \n\nIV.2.2 Onboard Preliminary Processing Flows \n\nThe adopted onboard processing flow was composed of five main processing flows: Flow \n\n1: Geometry Assignment; Flow 2: Frequency Filtering; Flow 3: Velocity Analysis; Flow 4: \n\nStack; and Flow 5: Post-Stack Time Migration. \n\n \n\nIV.2.2.1 FLOW 1 - Data Input  \n\nThe seismic lines acquired during the BURATO4240 survey were recorded in \n\ndemultiplexed SEG-D format which consists of one file per shot. Each acquired line \n\nbegins with the Field File Identification (FFID) number 99. This FFID 99 refers to a test \n\nshot made each time that the acquisition system starts, and consequently for processing, \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n56 \n \n\nit needs to be discarded. Then, each of the recorded shots produces a new seismic file \n\nsaved with a name corresponding to the respective FFID number, stored in the trace \n\nheaders. Each of the recorded SEG-D seismic file consistes of 156 channels in which the \n\nfirst three channels, marked in the header as negative, are Auxiliary Channels, which \n\nwere not used for processing purposes. The seismic files were loaded into ProMAX using \n\nthe Channel Marker as the primary sorting key to ensure that the files were read from \n\nchannels 1 to 156.  \n\nIn the trace headers there is also information about the pre-amplifier device of the \n\nstreamer, in this case a Sercel 408XL (Figure IV.5). This pre-amplifier produces an \n\nundesirable low frequency noise in the data that has to be removed in the early stages of \n\nseismic processing. \n\n \n\nFigure IV.5 \u2013 ProMAX 2D processing flow 1 \u2013 Data Input. \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n57 \n \n\nAfter all the seismic data being correctly imported, the data was saved into internal \n\ndatabases of the processing system and a shot-by-shot screening was performed in order \n\nto identify potential problems in individual shots, such as wrong delays, bad channels, \n\nhigh noise, miss-shots or shot desynchronization. All these problems, when found, \n\ndepending on their effect on the processing were marked for later correction, or \n\nimmediately removed. \n\nThe initial seismic lines which were acquired at 1 ms sample interval were resampled to 2 \n\nms, which was the sampling interval selected for the other seismic lines. \n\n \n\nIV.2.2.2 FLOW 2 - Geometry Assignment \n\nThe next step in the seismic processing is the assignment of the acquisition geometry. \n\nThis is set to determine the horizontal offset of every trace and to calculate the position of \n\nthe various CMP?s (Common Mid Points). This information is automatically inserted into \n\nthe seismic files trace headers. \n\nFor the geometry definition, the minimum and maximum offset were calculated. The \n\nMinimum offset is defined as the distance between the center point of the source array \n\nand the middle point of the first group of hydrophones, located in the first active section of \n\nthe streamer; for this geometry layout the minimum offset is 186.7m (Figure IV.1). The \n\nmaximum offset is defined as the distance between the center point of the source array \n\nand the middle point of the last receiver group; in this case 2124.2m (Figure IV.1). The \n\ncalculated CMP interval is 6.25 meters, with a CMP fold of 20. The values concerning the \n\nCMP and Offsets were loaded into the project database and the shots? FFIDs were \n\nrenumbered to start at 100. At this stage the data was also corrected for static shifts due \n\nto the different depths of the seismic sources and receivers. \n\nIn ProMAX 2D, the process to assign the geometry to the file headers is called 2D Marine \n\nGeometry Spreadsheet (Figure IV.6), where all the information about the acquisition \n\nparameters, presented above in Table IV.1, must be inserted. Next, the geometry \n\nparameters are loaded into the headers of the seismic files (a, in Figure IV.6) \n\nStill on this flow, a Bandpass filter (Ornsby filter) with a low-cut frequency of 15Hz and a \n\nhigh-cut frequency of 200Hz was applied (b, in Figure IV.6). \n\nTo correct the amplitudes decay with depth (time in the seismic profile) a True Amplitude \n\nRecovery (TAR) processing was added to the processing flow. This TAR applies a time \n\nvariant gain function to the seismic traces to compensate for the loss of amplitude due to \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n58 \n \n\nwave front spreading and attenuation, using a spherical divergence correction and a gain \n\nfunction increasing 1.5dB per second (c, in Figure IV.6). \n\nThe output seismic file is a seismic file with the assigned geometry, filtered in the \n\nfrequency domain for noise attenuation, and with statics and amplitudes corrections. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.6 \u2013 ProMAX 2D processing flow 2 \u2013 Geometry; the Parallel End and Parallel Begin \nsteps allow running the processes in parallel processors, using full advantage of mulit-processing \nsystems. \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n59 \n \n\nIV.2.2.3 FLOW 3 - Velocity Analysis \n\nThis is one of the most fundamental steps in multichannel seismic processing and \n\ninvolves the determination of the seismic velocity on CMP/CDP gathers, in order to correct \n\nfor the Normal Moveout effect of the gathers, and produce a Stacked Seismic Section \n\n(see details of theory in section IV.3.2 \u2013 Flow 1). \n\nSuccessful stacking, multiple attenuation, and time and depth migration, are seismic \n\nprocessing steps that require proper velocity inputs and that is why this operation is \n\nfundamental. For this purpose, CMP supergathers were created. The supergather \n\ndatabase calculated consisted of a set of chosen CMP traces, at defined intervals. For this \n\nsurvey, intervals of 25, 50 or 100 CMPs were used, depending of the total amount of \n\nCMPs in each individual seismic line. The CMP fold, the first CMP to analyse, the last \n\nCMP to analyse, the CMP interval and the number of CMP?s to combine (bin) to obtain the \n\nbest velocity semblance computing, were defined (Figure IV.7).  \n\nInteractive Velocity Analysis was performed on the supergathers in order to pick the best \n\nstacking velocities (Figure IV.8). The minimum and maximum velocities specified for \n\nvelocity analyses were 1450m/s and 4000 m/s, respectively, with 151 semblance \n\ncalculations. Maximum velocity semblance values were determined and marked for \n\ntabulation, from the first bottom arrival to approximately 8000 ms.  \n\nAt about 200 ms below the first arrival, an inverted velocity reflector was found, which \n\nappears to be created due to a desynchronization of the airguns in the source array, \n\nappearing a second shot (same polarity), with lower intensity, 200 ms after of the main \n\nshot. After velocity picking, a velocity QC display was used to check the quality of the \n\ndata. \n\nThe Normal Moveout Correction (NMO) was performed after the picking of the velocity \n\nmodel. This step corrects the time shift for each trace in a gather due to the offsets \n\nbetween receivers and sources on the arrival time corresponding to a same reflection \n\npoint; as such, reflections from the same reflector will be summed together and the signal-\n\nto-noise ratio and the quality of the seismic data will be increased. In a nutshell, the NMO \n\nstep corrects the data to the zero-offset location. If the reflector has no significant local \n\ndip, which can often be assumed as a first approximation in the initial processing, this \n\ncorrection is the only one needed; in the presence of significant dips, other \n\napproximations need to be taken, such as the Dip Moveout Correction (DMO). \n\n \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n60 \n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.7 \u2013 ProMAX 2D processing flow 3 \u2013 Velocity Analysis. \n\n \n\n \n\nIV.2.2.4 FLOW 4 - Brute Stack \n\nA brute stack consists on a processed seismic record that contains traces from a NMO \n\ncorrected common midpoint gather that have been added together horizontally. Stacked \n\nsections have an overall increase of the signal-to-noise ratio, since random noise is \n\ncancelled in the summation process.  \n\nThe NMO correction applied to the data before the stack, was based on the RMS (Root \n\nMean Square) velocity model previously picked. After this NMO correction, the several \n\nCMP?s were stacked together, and a stacked section was obtained (Figure IV.9). A \n\nstacked section is shown in Figure IV.12a. \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n61 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.8 \u2013 Interactive Velocity Analysis: A) \u2013 Semblance plot with velocity picks; B) SuperGather display; the small black box represents the inverted \n\nvelocity reflector (see explanation on the text). \n\n \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n62 \n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.9 - ProMAX 2D processing flow 4 \u2013 Brute Stack. \n\n \n\nIV.2.2.5 FLOW 5 - Post-Stack Time Migration \n\nThe previous stack was performed with the simplistic assumption that the seismic \n\nreflectors are roughly. As such, the reflectors in a stacked seismic section will not be \n\ncorrectly positioned and seismic migration (see a detailed explanation in IV.3.2 \u2013 Flow 6) \n\nneeds to be applied to correct for this effect. Migration can be applied after the stack \n\n(post-stack migration) or before stack (pre-stack migration). This processing step is \n\nessential in complex geological environments, whenever the geological structures vary \n\nlaterally and have important dips, since it will move the dipping events, in the up-dip \n\ndirection, on the seismic section, from their apparent locations to their true locations, in \n\ntime (or depth). \n\nBesides correcting for the reflectors geometry, the migration process also collapses \n\ndiffractions caused by the scattering of the seismic energy in sharp discontinuities. In \n\nsome specific cases, such as when there is a need to image deep reflections, seismic \n\nsections are migrated from time (TWT) into depth. In these situations, a much more \n\ndetailed velocity analysis and ray trace modeling is needed. For long offset data, pre-stack \n\nvelocity analysis can then be performed. Nevertheless, without a good velocity control, the \n\ndepths in depth-converted seismic sections are always approximate, whereas the sections \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n63 \n \n\nin time are correct. For this reason, geophysicists normally prefer to show the data on \n\nTwo-Way Time (TWT) and perform depth conversion only when necessary. \n\nFor the onboard processing purpose, a Kirchhoff migration algorithm was applied to the \n\ndata. This method uses the integral form (Kirchhoff equation) of the wave equation. All \n\nmethods of seismic migration involve the backpropagation (or continuation) of the seismic \n\nwavefield from the region where it was measured (Earth's surface) into the region to be \n\nimaged. In the Kirchhoff migration, this is done by using the Kirchhoff integral \n\nrepresentation of the acoustic field at a given point as a (weighted) superposition of waves \n\npropagating from adjacent points and times. Downward continuation of the wavefield \n\nrequires a background model of seismic velocity, which is usually a model of constant or \n\nsmoothly varying velocity. Because of the integral form of Kirchhoff migration, its \n\nimplementation reduces to stacking the data along diffraction hyperbolas that trace the \n\narrival time of energy scattered by image points in the earth. \n\nThere are several main parameters that need to be known before applying a Kirchhoff \n\nMigration, and these must be tested before the production of a final migrated section: \n\n? Trace spacing: This is the CMP spacing for zero-offset or stacked seismic data. \n\n? Dip limits: The correct impulse response up to 90\u00ba is given by a semi-circle; \n\nhowever the migration can be limited to shallower dip angles if required. This can \n\nbe used to speed computation time and filter dipping noise. \n\n? Migration aperture: In theory diffractions extend to infinite time and distance, but in \n\npractice the useable amplitude is much less than infinite so an aperture is chosen \n\nover which to make the summation. The aperture may be measured in distance \n\nand should be large enough to encompass the largest lateral movement envisaged \n\nfrom the highest velocity and steepest dip in the section. The migration aperture in \n\nmost of the 2D multichannel seismic data, corresponds to the streamer length; \n\n? Frequency limit: Some implementations also request frequency limits; this is \n\ngenerally chosen as the maximum frequency of the data, with significant energy, \n\nas determined from the corresponding frequency spectra. \n\nFor the onboard processing, a maximum dip of 20 degrees was used and a migration \n\naperture of 2200m was selected. The maximum frequency to migrate was set to 250 Hz, \n\nwhich is the maximum frequency on the original signal data (Figure IV.10). An example of \n\nthe application of post-stack Kirchhoff Migration to one of the processed seismic lines is \n\npresented in Figure IV.12b. \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n64 \n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.10 \u2013 ProMAX 2D processing flow 5 \u2013 Migration. \n\n \n\nIV.2.2.6 FLOW 6 - Data Output \n\nOver the migrated seismic section a top Mute was applied to remove the first arrival noise \n\nand the effect of the migration above the seabottom. As soon as a satisfactory processed \n\nseismic section was obtained, the data was exported as a standard SEG-Y file, in order to \n\nbe imported on a conventional seismic interpretation system. The SEG-Y data was \n\nexported in IBM 16-bits real format. \n\n \n\nFigure IV.11 \u2013 ProMAX 2D processing flow 6 -SEGY Output.\n\n\n\nChapter IV.

Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n67 \n \n\nIV. 3 Seismic Data Re-Processing \n\nAs stated before, one of the main aims of this work was to improve the onboard \n\npreliminary processing of acquired seismic lines. This was carried out at the Marine \n\nGeology and Geophysics Laboratory of the Geosciences Department of the University of \n\nAveiro, Portugal, in the scope of the present thesis.  \n\nIn order to accomplish this objective, the Seismic Processing Workshop (SPW) software \n\nfrom Parallel Geoscience Corporation was used and a more detailed processing flow was \n\ndesigned. A more detailed velocity model was obtained, and for some selected lines a \n\npre-stack time migration was applied. \n\n \n\nIV.3.1 The Seismic Processing Workshop (SPW) Software  \n\nSeismic Processing Workshop (SPW) is a software package for  seismic data and Ground \n\nPenetration Radar (GPR) processing developed by Parallel Geoscience Corporation \n\n(PGC). Originally developed for Macintosh platforms, SPW has been redesign and \n\nrewritten and is nowadays available for Windows XP, Windows 2000, Linux, and \n\nMacintosh PowerPC operating systems. \n\nSeveral SPW software licenses are available at the Geology and Geophysics Marine of \n\nthe University of Aveiro. These consists of four separately applications: i) FlowChart \n\nExecutor, ii) SeisViewer; iii) Vector Calculator; iv) I/O Utility (Figure IV.13). \n\n \n\nFigure IV.13 \u2013 Seismic Processing Workshop opening window with the 4 available modules \nhighlighted in: yellow \u2013 FlowChart; blue \u2013 SeisViewer; red \u2013 VectorCalculator; green \u2013 I/O Utility. \n\n \n\nIV.3.1.1 FlowChart / Executor \n\nFlowChart (Figure IV.14) is the SPW?s processing application. It allows the development \n\nof the processing flows and setting the parameters for each processing step. The \n\nFlowChart application contains four basic sub-windows: the FlowChart window, for \n\ncreating a processing flow; the Processing List; the Tool Palette; and the Console (Figure \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n68 \n \n\nIV.14). In this module each processing step can be thought as a \u201cbox\u201d that can be linked \n\nwith other processes in order to build a sequential net with all the desired processes. The \n\navailable processing steps are organized into 18 categories on the Processing List, where \n\neach one has a large list of processing algorithms. \n\nThe Executor application is the part of the SPW system that runs the processing flow after \n\nit has been built in the FlowChart. It reports such things as processing activity, job errors, \n\nand job status. The Executor has a DOS type console window for a user interface, and it \n\nis capable to run jobs sequentially.  \n\n \n\nFigure IV.14 \u2013 FlowChart window. \n\n \n\nIV.3.1.2 SeisViewer \n\nThe SeisViewer application is the seismic data display component of the SPW where the \n\nuser can display seismic sections in SEG-Y format or in the SPW?s internal processing \n\nformat (Figure IV.15). SeisViewer allows a complete customization of the seismic display. \n\nIn each seismic display there are several options which allow the configuration of the \n\nseismic input (select the input data) and of the seismic viewer (set-order, scales, \n\ncolorbars, amplitudes display). Besides the conventional seismic display, this module \n\nallows the possibility to perform some \u201con the fly\u201d processing steps (such as the \n\napplication of frequency filters, deconvolution, etc.) to quickly test processing parameters \n\nwhich can then be set-up in the processing module (Flowchart). \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n69 \n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.15 \u2013 SeisViewer window highlighting the processing steps available on this module. \n\n \n\nIV.3.1.3 Vector Calculator \n\nThe SPW VectorCalculator (VC) (Figure IV.16) is a trace analysis tool that operates like  \n\nvectorial scientific calculator. It can operate using scalar numbers as well as one-and two-\n\ndimensional vectors, and it can be used for simple mathematical functions or to analyze \n\nseismic trace data. For example, with this tool, it is possible to create plots of seismic \n\ntraces and calculate and display frequency spectra or autocorrelation function for a single \n\nseismic trace or a set of seismic traces. \n\n \n\nFigure IV.16 - VectorCalculator window \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n70 \n \n\nIV.3.1.4 I/O Utility \n\nSPW I/O Utility consists of a set of applications for file input, output and reformat (Figure \n\nIV.17). It has six main features, which may be accessed upon opening the application: 1) \n\nTape Analysis, 2) File Analysis, 3) Data Reformat, 4) Tape Image Copy, 5) SPW File \n\nMerge and 6) Tape Image Verify and 7) Create File Index.  \n\nThe I/O module, among other applications, allows the conversion between seismic \n\nformats, such SEG-Y into the SPW internal format, in order to properly process the data \n\n(Figure IV.17). Upon completion of the processing job, the user can return to this \n\napplication and re-convert the seismic file form SPW internal format to SEG-Y, for \n\nexporting to other processing or interpretation software packages. \n\n \n\nFigure IV.17 \u2013 I/O Utility window. \n\n \n\nIV.3.2 SPW Re-Processing Data Flows \n\nThe re-processing of the seismic data was carried out in order to increase the resolution \n\nof the data and thus obtain a better imaging for all the seismic sections. This task was \n\nperformed using several processing steps, including Geometry; Velocity Analysis; \n\nDeconvolution; CMP sort; Radon Demultiple; Dip Moveout/Pre-Stack time migration; \n\nBandwidth Extension and Post-Stack time migration.  \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n71 \n \n\nIV.3.2.1 Data Reformat \n\nBefore starting the seismic processing, the original SEG-D seismic files were converted \n\none-by-one into the SPW internal format using the I/O Utility module (Figure IV.18). \n\n \n\nFigure IV.18 \u2013 I/O Utility and parameters used to reformat the original SEG-D files into the SPW \n\ninternal format. \n\n \n\nIV.3.2.2 FLOW 1 - Geometry \n\nThe processing flow 1\u2013Geometry is composed by the following processes: Static Shift \n\ncorrection, Geometry Definition; Frequency Filtering; Amplitude Correction; and \n\nSuperGathers calculation and Velocity Analysis. \n\n \n\nStatic Shifts \n\nStatic corrections are applied to seismic data to time-shift all the seismic sources and \n\nreceivers to the same reference datum (the sea-surface, in this case), compensating for \n\nthe effects of variations in elevation, weathering thickness and weathering velocity.  \n\nStatic correction algorithms determine the reflection arrival times which would have been \n\nobserved if all measurements had been made on a flat plane. In marine seismic \n\nacquisition, there are no topography effects, except for wave swell, and therefore the \n\nstatic corrections are applied to correct the different tow depths of the seismic sources \n\nand receivers to the sea surface. \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n72 \n \n\nThe statics corrections are important because statics errors can severely distort the \n\nrecorded reflection hyperbolae (Yilmaz, 1987). These distortions are more critical in \n\nonshore data, but on marine data processing it is also necessary to compensate for the \n\ntow differences between sources and receivers. \n\nAs referred to before in the acquisition geometry section (IV.1), the seismic sources and \n\nreceivers tow depths were 7m and 7.5m, respectively. To correct for the source-receiver \n\ntow-depth it is necessary to sum the sources and receivers depth and convert the result to \n\ntime, using a constant seismic velocity for the water layer. For this purpose, this depth \n\nwas converted to time, giving a result of 9.6667 ms (7m+7.5m = 14.5m; 14.5m/1500m = \n\n9.6667ms).  \n\nIn SPW, the static correction process is called Static Shift and a value of 9.6667ms was \n\ninserted for this process. The result is a corrected seismic trace that honours the true \n\nwater depth (Figure IV.20). \n\n \n\nFigure IV.19 \u2013 Static Shift processing flow. Correction of the Gun &amp; Cable time shifts for all the \n\nseismic lines acquired. \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n73 \n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.20 \u2013 Source and receiver static correction (seismic line GB-10b): a) shot gather without \nStatic Shift correction; b) the same shot gather with Static Shift processing applied. \n\n \n\nGeometry Assignment \n\nThe correct configuration of the relative positioning of the seismic sources and receivers is \n\ncrucial for a precise and accurate seismic processing and velocity analysis. After this \n\nprocessing phase the correct location of each shot, seismic receiver and CMP location are \n\nwritten into the headers of the seismic file. A mistake in this step has a large impact on \n\nlater processing stages (e.g. migration); therefore it is necessary to pay an extreme \n\nattention to geometry assignment. \n\nFor the geometry assignment of marine seismic data it is necessary to define some \n\nseismic acquisition parameters such as: the shooting interval, the source and receivers \n\ntow depths, the number of active channels, the channel interval and the source-receiver \n\noffset. These seismic acquisition parameters can be consulted in Table IV.1. \n\nSPW works with its own SPW units and not with real geometry parameters. Consequently, \n\nin order to set this process correctly, the first step is to select a value which will \n\ncorrespond to an integer SPW unit. Normally, for the SPW unit a number that can be \n\nmultiple of both the seismic shooting interval and the channel spacing is chosen.  \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n74 \n \n\nConcerning the Gran Burato dataset the shooting interval and channel spacing is 50m and \n\n12.5m, respectively. So, since 50m is a multiple of 12.5, the defined SPW unit \n\ncorresponds to 12.5m (1 SPW = 12.5m and 2 SPW = 25m). A summary table with all the \n\nnecessary measurements for the geometry assignement concerning the real and SPW \n\nunits are presented in Table IV.2. \n\nTo assign the geometry in SPW, the processed called Geometry Definition is used. The \n\nGeometry Definition needs as inputs spreadsheets (designated as SPW File Cards), with \n\nthe location for all the sources (Source Location file card), all the receivers (Receiver \n\nLocation file card), and an Observer Notes SPS file which relates the sources with the \n\nreceivers locations for each shot. The Geometry Definition step computes the CMP \n\nnumber based on the source and receiver location, as: CMP Location = (Source Location \n\n+ Receiver Location) / 2. \n\n \n\nTable IV.2 \u2013 Acquisition parameters: true distances and corresponding SPW units. In order to get \nonly integer values the true distance of the Source-Receiver Offset was slightly changed (from \n186.7m to 187.5m), but this will be compensated at a later stage on the source card (no errors will \nbe committed; see explanation below in the text).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFor the Source Locations \u2013 SPS Format card, the position of each source location must \n\nbe given. This SPW file card is divided into 5 columns: Source Line; Source Location; \n\nEasting; Northing; and Depth. In 2D seismic data the first column (Source Line) is filled \n\nwith the number of the seismic line that is being processed. The second one \u2013 Source \n\nLocation \u2013 corresponds to the positions of each shot. The first position is an arbitrary \n\nnumber, and the next ones should be spaced according to the shooting interval in SPW \n\nunits (4 units, in this case, since the shot interval is 50m). \n\nFigure IV.21 shows an example of a Source Location card, in which the first position was \n\narbitrary defined as 1000; the second shot position is consequently 1004 (4 SPW units \n\nthat corresponds to the shooting interval).

Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n75 \n \n\nnumber of shots of the corresponding seismic line. On the remaining two columns \n\n(Easting and Northing), and for 2D seismic data, there is only the need to fill one (normally \n\nNorthing) with the correct coordinate or with an arbitrary number like 100000m. Here the \n\nprecise navigation was not used since lines are generally either E-W ou N-S. The \n\nnavigation was included when the SEG-Y processed files were uploaded into the package \n\nKingdom Suite, for interpretation. Since this column works with true distance, the \n\nincrement will correspond to the true shot spacing (50m). Thus, for this example, shown \n\nhere, the first row will be 100000, the second 100050, and so on. The Easting column it is \n\nfilled with zeros. The elevation is the tow depth of the seismic source, and in this specific \n\ncase it was 7m. \n\n \n\nFigure IV.21 \u2013 Source Locations \u2013 SPS Format card; specific case for seismic line GB-23; the row \nnumber 360 corresponds to the last shot and is equivalent to the total number of shots of this \nseismic line. Note in the Northing column the corrected values for the source-receiver offset \nadjustement (see explanation below on the text). \n\n \n\nThe Receivers Locations \u2013 SPS Format card is filled following the same criteria as used \n\nfor the Source Location file card. The column of the Receiver line, Easting and Elevation \n\nare filled as the same way as explained above. For the receiver location column the \n\ninserted values should correspond to the positioning of every location that the receiver will \n\nhave during the seismic acquisition in SPW coordinates. This card must take into account \n\nall the receivers locations; they will range between the last receiver of the first shot until \n\nthe location of the first receiver for the last shot. The position of the last receiver for the \n\nfirst shot is the first shot location minus the Source-Receiver Offset distance plus the width \n\nof the streamer until the last receiver group. As an example for the first shot, we must \n\nsubtract to 1000 (Source Location of the first shot) 187.5 which is the Source-Receiver \n\nOffset, and 155*12.5, which is the width of the streamer between active section. However, \n\nfor the receiver location column, we must use SPW Units which is 830. Notice that since \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n76 \n \n\nthe Source-Receiver Offset is not a multiple of the SPW unit (12.5) we consider this value \n\nas 15 SPW units. The remaining 0.8m will be subtraced to the Northing column of the \n\nSource Locations card and this will correct fot the fact that the true offset is 186.7m and \n\nnot 187.5m (see Figure IV.21). Next rows will increase by 1 since the receiver spacing is \n\nequal to 1 SPW unit. The Northing column follows the same rule, now with real distances. \n\nThe Northing of the last receiver of the first shot is: 100000 (Shot Location) subtracted by \n\n187.5m, and by 155*12.5 (streamer width of the active section), resulting in 97875. The \n\nReceiver Locations \u2013 SPS Format filled from an arbitrary line is show in Figure IV.22. \n\n \n\nFigure IV.22 \u2013 Receiver Location\u2013 SPS Format card; specific case of the seismic line GB-23. \n\n \n\nThe Observers Notes \u2013 SPS Format card is constituted by 9 columns: Field File; Source \n\nLine; Source Location; First Channel; Last Channel; Channel Increment; Receiver Line; \n\nFirst Receiver; and Receiver Increment (Figure IV.23). The first column should be filled \n\nwith the original Field File Number (FFN) which can be found on the SEG-Y seismic file. \n\nFor 2D seismic data the Source and Receiver Line columns should be filled exactly as \n\ndescription above for the Source and Receiver Location file cards. The first and last \n\nchannel columns correspond to the original first and last channel of the streamer used \n\nduring the seismic acquisition. Finally the column denominated as Channel Increment \n\nmust be filled with the SPW unit value that corresponds to the real distance between \n\nreceiver groups. In marine systems, it is very common to make negative the SPW \n\ndistance between channels, since the receivers are placed in an opposite direction of the \n\nacquisition path, behind the acquisition vessel and behind the source array. The Observer \n\nNotes card has as many rows as the numbers of shots. An example of an Observer Notes \n\n\u2013 SPS Format card, filled for an arbitrary line, is show in Figure IV.23. \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n77 \n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.23 \u2013 Observer Notes \u2013 SPS Format card; specific case of the seismic line GB-23. Note \nthat the values on the first and last row must coincide with the values from Source Locations and \nReceiver Location cards. \n\n \n\nAs a quality check for the geometry parameterization, after filling the 3 geometry cards: i) \n\nthe last shot on the Source Location card has to be the same has the last shot on the \n\nObserver Notes (Figure IV.21; Figure IV.23); ii) the last first receiver location on the \n\nReceiver Locations card has to be the same as the last receiver on the Observer Notes \n\n(Figure IV.22; Figure IV.23). \n\nThe next figure is a schematic representation that summarizes how to set the correct \n\ngeometry for a 2D seismic line in SPW, and how the real coordinates of shot points and \n\nreceivers are related with the SPW ones (Figure IV.24). An Excell spreadsheet was \n\ndeveloped to perform these calculations. \n\n \n\nFigure IV.24 \u2013 Schematic representation of the geometry acquisition for seismic line GB-23 (360 \nshots), acquired during the scientific cruise BURATO4240. The blue values correspond to true \ndistances, and the red values represent the same distance in SPW units (1SPW = 12.5m). \nFollowing the acquisition geometry, the first shot position can be defined as 1000; the Source-\nReceiver offset was 187.5m; the shooting spacing 50m; and the spacing between channels 12.5m, \nwith a total of 156 channels. The calculus of the geometry with true distance (e.g. to fill the Northing \ncolumn) is done the same way, but using the true values (blue color). Si - Shot number; Ci - \nChannel number. \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n78 \n \n\nFrequency Filtering \n\nAfter the static shifts corrections have been made and the geometry correctly assigned, a \n\nfrequency band-pass filter was applied to the data in order to eliminate the undesirable \n\nfrequencies and therefore to increase the signal-to-noise ration of the seismic data. \n\nThe seismic frequency component of the data is the basis for most of all seismic \n\nprocessing techniques, and also plays a significant role in static corrections, velocity \n\nanalysis, deconvolution, filtering, stacking and migration. Unlike seismic amplitudes, the \n\nimportance of the frequency component is not apparent to naked eye, since it acts in the \n\nbackground or behind the scene in data processing techniques (Yilmaz, 2001a).  \n\nFrequency displays may be used as one of the myriad seismic attributes for direct \n\nhydrocarbon indicators in certain type of hydrocarbon reservoirs. Frequency variations \n\ndue to processing techniques are also used as a tool to quality control seismic data \n\nprocessing. The high frequency content is desired in seismic sections for a better \n\nresolution allowing the interpretation of thin-layer target formations (Hatten et al., 1986; \n\nYilmaz, 2001a) \n\nTo maintain the frequency content of the seismic signal within a certain range of interest \n\n(to preserve the information desirable), frequency filters are applied to the seismic data. \n\nThe frequency filters discriminate against selected frequency components of an input and \n\ncan be band-pass, band-reject, high-pass (low-cut) or low pass (high-cut) filters in terms \n\nof their frequency response. All of these filters are based on the same principle \u2013 \n\nconstruction of a zero-phase wavelet with an amplitude spectrum that meets one of these \n\nfour specifications (Yilmaz, 2001a).  \n\nThe main aim of designing a frequency filter is to pass a certain bandwidth with little or no \n\nmodification, and to largely suppress the remaining part of the spectrum as much as \n\npossible, without creating edge effects. Band-pass filtering is commonly used, because a \n\nseismic trace typically contains both low-frequency noise, such as ground roll or other, \n\nand some high-frequency ambient noise. Frequency filtering can be performed at various \n\nstages in data processing (Yilmaz, 2001a). \n\nLow-frequency noise on marine seismic data is frequently observed, induced by the swell \n\nor by the streamer movement. On the seismic lines processed in the scope of this thesis, \n\nthis low-frequency content is well visible and completely obscures the seismic signal \n\n(Figure IV.25). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n79 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.25 \u2013 Shot gather of the seismic line GB-01, showing the low-frequency noise affecting \n\nthe quality of the seismic signal. \n\n \n\nIn order to correctly parameterize the filters, a frequency spectrum must be firstly \n\ncalculated. The frequency spectrum can be calculated using the VectorCalculator and \n\nselecting from the seismic section a single seismic trace or a set of seismic traces (Figure \n\nIV.26). \n\nIt can be concluded that the seismic traces have a strong low-frequency content that has \n\nto be removed. The high-frequency content seems free of disturbing noise (Figure IV.26). \n\nFor low frequency noise, a Butterworth Filter, was applied to the data. In SPW, this kind of \n\nfilter is applied using the Butterworth Filter routine. As input parameters the user must \n\nspecify the low pass, high pass and high and low rolloff rates in decibels (dB; the length of \n\nthe taper) and the phase of the applied filter (zero or minimum phase) (Figure IV.27). \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n80 \n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.26 \u2013 Frequency Spectrum of a set of seismic traces of the seismic line GB-01. Low-\nfrequency content is easily identified (red box); the removal of the frequencies below 6Hz is \nadvised. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.27 \u2013 Butterworth filtering processing step. For the case of the seismic line GB-01, only \nthe low cut option was selected and the 6Hz were choose for the low frequency cut value letting the \nremaining frequencies as originally recorded. A zero-phase filter was selected. \n\n \n\nThe enhancement provided by the Butterwoth filter on the signal-to-noise ratio of the data \n\nis clearly observed on the seismic profile shown in Figure IV.28.  \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n81 \n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.28 - Frequency filtering process applied to the seismic line GB-01. The enhancement on \n\nthe quality of the data is evident when comparing the shot gathers of the unfiltered seismic section \n\n(a) and the filtered seismic section (b). Also of notice is the difference in the frequency spectra of \n\nboth the unfiltered with a huge component of low-frequencies (c), and the filtered (d). \n\n \n\nAmplitude Correction  \n\nMost of the seismic processing techniques operate on the amplitude content of the \n\nseismic data. In fact, the final processing data frequently presents a different amplitude \n\ncontent when compared with the original seismic data. In adition, relative amplitude \n\ndisplays are commonly used, in particular those that enhance the presence of direct \n\nhydrocarbon indicators. \n\nThere are many factors which affect the amplitude of the seismic signal as it propagates \n\nthrough the Earth. One of them is the low-pass filter behavior of the Earth?s subsurface, \n\nwhere the high frequencies of the propagating signal are rapidly absorbed. Another effect \n\nis the so called spherical divergence. \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n82 \n \n\nConsidering the position of a wavefront at a certain time, it is possible to calculate its \n\nposition at a later time by means of Huygen?s principle, which states that each point on the \n\nwavefront can be regarded as a new source point, from which a spherical wavefront \n\npropagates (McQuillin et al., 1984; Sheriff and Geldart, 1995; Yilmaz, 2001a; Figure \n\nIV.29). \n\n \n\nFigure IV.29 \u2013 Schematic representation for the Huygen?s principle (McQuillin et al., 1984.). \n\n \n\nIn a homogeneous medium, the wavefront from a point on the reflector will be spherical. \n\nAs the wavefront expands, the energy of the disturbance is spread over a larger and \n\nlarger area, so that the amplitude of the seismic wave decreases. This effect is called \n\nspherical divergence, and is the main reason why reflections from deep interfaces tend to \n\nhave smaller amplitudes when compared with those from shallower areas (McQuillin et \n\nal., 1984). Spherical divergence causes the wave amplitude to decay as 1/r, where r is the \n\nradius of the wavefront.  \n\nOther important factor which has major effects on a propagating wave field is absorption. \n\nThis effect results in a change of frequency content of the initial source signal in a time-\n\nvariant manner, as it propagates through the subsurface. In order to attenuate this effect, \n\nAutomatic Gain Control (AGC) is commonly used. Additionally, sometimes a gain function \n\ncan be used to compensate for attenuation losses (Yilmaz, 2001a). \n\nIn order to correct for the spherical divergence effect on this re-processing work a \n\nSpherical Divergence Correction was applied. This process increases the gain of the data \n\nusing a spatially averaged velocity function with the time, compensating in this way the \n\namplitude of deeper reflections. The Spherical Divergence Correction processing step \n\nwas applied with the default parameterization, as it is showed in Figure IV.30. In addition, \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n83 \n \n\nand to increase the amplitude content of the data in the deeper section a gain curve was \n\nbuild with an increase of 1dB per second. This function was applied to the seismic line \n\nalready compensated for the spherical divergence, using the SPW process called Gain \n\nFunction (Figure IV.31). \n\n \n\nFigure IV.30 \u2013 Spherical Divergence processing and used parameters. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.31 \u2013 Processing step where a gain function which increases the amplitude content of the \n\ndata by 1dB per second was applied. \n\n \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n84 \n \n\nAfter these amplitudes corrections, improvements on the deeper reflections amplitudes \n\nare easily observed (Figure IV.32). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.32 \u2013 Shot gather of the seismic line GB-01, before and after the Amplitude Correction \nprocessing step. \n\n \n\nSingle Channel Display \n\nAs a quality control of the processing already performed, the data recorded on a single \n\nseismic channel was exported in order to quickly be opened on SeisViewer module for \n\ndisplay.  \n\nThe seismic file previously created after the amplitude correction is now the input for a \n\nSPW General Trace Sort card. This process will allow exporting just the first channel \n\nusing the following parameterization (Figure IV.33): \n\n1\nst\n \u2013 Field File \u2013 the input file is first sorted by the Field File number on each \n\nchannel; a bin defines how the sorted data type is grouped and consists of one or \n\n\n\nChapter IV.

In this case, Channel 1 was \n\nselected; a bin defines how the sorted data type is grouped and consists of one or \n\nmore adjacent locations sorted into the same output location; the bin interval is the \n\nnumber of locations to skip to reach the next location for output. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.33 \u2013 How to export the data from one single channel using SPW?s NearTrace processing \n\nstep. \n\n \n\nThe parameterization and the processing flow presented in Figure IV.33 Include a Normal \n\nMoveout correction with a constant velocity of 1500m/s. The Normal Moveout corrected \n\ndata is then outputed as a seismic file, corresponding to the near traces (the data from all \n\nthe shot recorded in the first channel) (Figure IV.34). \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n86 \n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.34 \u2013 Near trace section: example from seismic profile GB-23 \u2013 Channel1. \n\n \n\nSuperGather and Velocity Analysis \n\nAfter the geometry definition, the filtering and the amplitude correction steps follow a \n\nvelocity analysis is performed, which will be used for the stack and migration algorithms.  \n\nSeismic data provides an indirect measurement of the velocity of the signal propagation \n\nthroughout the subsurface, allowing the exploration geophysicist to derive a large number \n\nof different types of velocity: interval, apparent, average, root-mean-square (rms), \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n87 \n \n\ninstantaneous, phase, group, normal moveout (NMO), stacking and migration velocities \n\n(Yilmaz, 2001a).  \n\nIn terms of seismic processing the stacking velocity is the one that yields the best stack, it \n\nis approximately an rms velocity (Yilmaz, 2001a). Velocity estimation requires the data to \n\nbe recorded at long offsets on common-midpoint (CMP) sections. With estimated \n\nvelocities it is possible to correct for non-zero offset and compress the recorded data \n\nvolume to a staked section.  \n\nFor a single constant-velocity horizontal reflector, the traveltime curve as a function of \n\noffset is a hyperbola centered at x=0. The time difference between traveltime at a given \n\noffset and at zero offset is called normal moveout (NMO). The velocity required to correct \n\nthe normal moveout is called the normal moveout velocity. \n\nConventional velocity analysis is based on the hyperbolic assumption. The hyperbolic \n\ntraveltime equation is linear in the (t\n2\n \u2013 x\n\n2\n) plane. Zero-offset time and the stacking velocity \n\nfor a given reflector can be estimated from the straight line that best fits the traveltime \n\npicks plotted on the (t\n2\n) versus (x\n\n2\n) plane. Another way to pick velocities is using Constant \n\nVelocity Panels, using a range of constant velocity values, and chosing the velocity that \n\nbest flattens each event (Hatten et al., 1986; Yilmaz, 2001a). \n\nAnother common velocity analysis technique is based on computing the velocity \n\nspectrum, or Semblance. The idea is to display some measurement of the signal \n\ncoherency after stack for different velocities on a graph of velocity versus two-way zero-\n\noffset time. Since its introduction by Taner and Koehler (1969), it has been an \n\nindispensable tool for velocity analysis of seismic records. The underlying principle is to \n\ncompute the signal coherency on the CMP gather in small time gates that follows a \n\nhyperbolic trajectory. Stacking velocities are interpreted from velocity spectra by choosing \n\nthe velocity function that produces the highest coherency. If data from all channels are \n\nperfectly coherent, or show continuity from trace to trace, the semblance has a value of a \n\nunity, at times with significant event amplitudes (Hatton et al., 1986; Yilmaz, 2001a). The \n\nSemblance is a velocity spectrum defined as a quantitative measure of the coherence of \n\nseismic data from multiple channels. It is equal to the energy of a stacked trace divided by \n\nthe energy of all the traces that make up the stack. In this processing work, the \n\nSemblance was used to perform the velocity analysis,  \n\nNormal moveout (NMO) velocity analysis using semblance spectra (Taner and Koehler, \n\n1969) is an important first step toward building a stacking and migration velocity model. \n\nThe accuracy of the velocity model depends on the user?s ability to pick the correct \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n88 \n \n\nvelocity, which on the other hand also depends on the accuracy and resolution of the \n\nsemblance spectrum itself.  \n\nVelocity analysis involves a considerable number of calculations and hence it is fairly \n\nexpensive to execute. Therefore, in order to reduce the costs and time of this operation, \n\nwhen the numbers of traces in a CMP gather is large, or when there is a large number of \n\ngathers, representative CMP locations are selected for velocity analysis. Depending on \n\nthe total number of CMP gathers, the selected locations for velocity picking may be \n\nspaced by intervals of 20, 50 or 100. In this work selected CMP?s for velocity analysis \n\nwere spaced every 50 CMP?s. \n\nVelocity analyzes are ordinarily picked by an interpreter and not automatically. Picking \n\nvelocities involves selecting the time-velocity values to be used in subsequent processing. \n\nThe velocity-analysis interpreter often has the main purpose of achieving a good stack, \n\nand stacking can often tolerate appreciable velocity errors. The interpreter is ordinarily \n\nguided by a set of simple rules (e.g. Yilmaz, 1987; Hatten et al., 1996; Sheriff and Geldart, \n\n1995): \n\n1. an increase in stacking velocity Vs with increasing depth is more probable than a \n\ndecrease; \n\n2. in marine data, an interval velocity greater than 6700 m/s or less than 1430 m/s is \n\nunlikely; \n\n3. the difference in interval velocity for successive layers should exceed 2%; \n\n4. any event at about twice the t0 of a previous event and with approximately the \n\nsame Vs is probably a multiple and should not be picked. Multiples will have \n\nvelocities that are low and diffractions and sideswipe events are apt to have \n\nvelocities that are unreasonably high. \n\nThe accuracy and resolution of the stacking velocity values clearly depend on acquisition \n\nfactors such as the receiver line length, the fold, the recorded bandwidth, the signal-to-\n\nnoise ratio, and the lack of near- or far-offset traces, as well as on the processing steps \n\nperformed before the velocity analysis (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). \n\nThe velocity model derived from the velocity analysis should be plotted at the same \n\nvertical scale as the seismic section so that they can be overlaid on the section. In this \n\nway, it is easier to identify stacking-velocity picks with specific events of interest, and this \n\nalso allows that the same reflection events are picked at successive CMP Locations. \n\nGenerally, as many events as possible should be picked, since picking many events often \n\ndiscloses important interpretation clues. \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n89 \n \n\nNowadays modern processing flows include velocity analysis processes that imply the \n\ncreation of Super Gathers, instead of using regular CMP Gathers, Semblance grids and \n\nconstant velocity stack panels. In SPW, there are two ways of building Super Gathers. \n\nThe standard way is to use already established processes: Build Super Gathers process, \n\nlinked to a SuperGather Velocity Analysis box, and with a Seismic File card as an output. \n\nThis creates three different files: a Constant Velocity Panel, a SuperGather or a binned \n\nseismic gather, and a Semblance seismic grid.  \n\nA Constant Velocity Panel is composed of short displays of CMP data (normally 5 to 25 \n\nCMP?s; Hatton et al., 286) where each of the displays represent stacks made with different \n\nconstant normal moveout velocities, that range from the lowest expected velocity to the \n\nhighest one. The panel will show which velocities better correct the NMO effect for each \n\nseismic event on the different stacks created with different NMO velocities. \n\nA SuperGather is also a CMP gather but with the difference that is built by summing \n\nseveral consecutive CMP gathers. \n\nAn alternative procedure, in SPW, consists in a sequence of header operations using the \n\nTrace Header Cell Math process in order to obtain just a seismic file which is then used as \n\na Binned Gather (SuperGather) or Semblance at the same time. Since in this re-\n\nprocessing process the Constant Velocity Panels were not used for velocity picking, and \n\ndue to its robustness, the second alternative was used.  \n\nThe input file in this processing step is the amplitude corrected seismic file which is sorted \n\nby CMP first and then by Offset. The CMP sort was done by binning 8 consecutive CMP \n\nlocations at intervals of 100 locations. Then these were sorted considering the entire \n\nrange of offsets. \n\nAfter the CMP sorting, six header operations were performed, using the Trace Header \n\nCell Math cards. The objective of these operations is to get a SuperGather with the \n\nmaximum fold possible for each desirable CMP position (see explanation on Appendix A). \n\nThe output seismic gathers, after the header manipulation are seismic files that can work \n\nboth as a binned gather (the SuperGather), or as a semblance grid. In order, to build a \n\nreliable velocity model the picking velocities process should be done using both panels, \n\nthe Super Gathers and the Semblance grid, a the same time (Figure IV.35). \n\nThe velocity analysis is done in a combined display were the Super Gathers can be \n\nviewed side-by-side with the semblance spectrum. The semblance displays the velocities \n\nas contours of a measure of coherence (violet in Figure IV.35; which are the areas that \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n90 \n \n\nshould be picked to create the velocity model, since they corresponds to the best stacking \n\nvelocities). \n\n \n\nFigure IV.35 \u2013 SuperGather and Semblance displayed in SeisViewer. \n\n \n\nIn addition, in SPW, while the user is picking the velocities in the semblance panel the \n\neffect of the NMO correction with the picked velocity can be viewed in the CMP gather. In \n\nthis way it is possible to adjust the velocities that better correct the reflection hyperbola \n\n(makes them horizontal). \n\nAs best practice, is to use three different displays simultaneously, which can also be done \n\nin SPW (Figure IV.36): \n\ni) SuperGather;  \n\nii) Semblance grid spectrum;  \n\niii) Display of the velocity picks (the velocity model) on top of a stacked section.  \n\n \n\nComplete Flow \n\nAll the seismic processing steps presented and described above were compiled into a \n\nsingle seismic processing SPW flow: 1-Geometry (Figure IV.37). \n\n\n\nChapter IV.

At this stage, a stack of the seismic \n\nprofile was produced to evaluate the geometry, filtering, statics corrections, amplitude \n\nrecovery, and the velocity model created on the previous processing flow. \n\nTo execute the stack of the seismic profiles it is necessary to apply the normal moveout \n\ncorrection and sum all the seismic traces in each CMP gather (the stacking process itself) \n\ninto a final stacked section. The normal moveout effect is removed using the velocity \n\nmodel picked in the previous step.  \n\nAs already mentioned above, the energy reflected from a single interface arrives at the \n\nreceivers at times which are dependent on the offset between the receivers and the \n\nsources. Corrections for these delays (NMO corrections) are made such that arrival times, \n\nfrom the same reflecting point in the same CMP gather, on each trace are the same, and \n\nare equal to the two-way travel time that would be observed if source and receiver were \n\ncoincident, i.e. at zero-offset.  \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n93 \n \n\nAn undesirable side-effect of the NMO correction is the deformation of the wavelet caused \n\nby the NMO stretch effect on the larger offsets (Figure IV.38; Hatton et al., 1986). \n\n \n\nFigure IV.38 \u2013 Inherent distortion in moveout correction (modified from Hatton et al., 1986). \n\n \n\nFigure IV. 39 shows the simple case of a single horizontal layer. At a given midpoint \n\nlocation, M, the traveltime along the raypath from the shot position S, to the depth point D, \n\nand  back to the receiver position R is t(x). \n\nUsing the Pythagorean Theorem, the traveltime equation can be described by a hyperbola \n\nequation in the plane of two-way time versus offset (Equation 6): \n\n \n\n                     \n\n \n\nwhere x is the distance (offset) between the source and receiver position, v is the velocity \n\nof the medium above the reflecting interface, and t(0) is twice the traveltime along the \n\nvertical path MD. Note that the vertical projection of point D to the surface, along the \n\nnormal to the reflector, coincides with midpoint M, only for horizontal interfaces. \n\nDeveloping Equation 6 it is possible to compute the velocity when offset x and two-way \n\ntimes t(x) and t(0) are known (Equation 7). The difference between the two-way time at a \n\ngiven offset t(x) and the two-way zero-offset time t(0) is the Normal Moveout (Equation 7; \n\nFigure IV.40) \n\n(Eq. 6) \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n94 \n \n\n \n\nFigure IV. 39 \u2013 The NMO geometry for a single horizontal reflector (refer to equation 7) (modified \n\nfrom Yilmaz, 1987). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.40  \u2013 NMO correction involves mapping non-zero offset traveltime t(x) onto zero-offset \ntraveltime: blue box \u2013 shot gather before NMO correction; red box \u2013 shot gather after NMO \ncorrections. \n\n(Eq.7) \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n95 \n \n\nThe NMO correction \n\nThe NMO corrections can produce three different results in the data: undercorrected, \n\ncorrected or overcorrected events. Undercorrection occurs when a velocity higher that the \n\nsupposed NMO velocity is used for the NMO correction. On the other hand, if a lower \n\nvelocity is used, overcorrection occurs. The aimed corrected horizon is obtained by the \n\nuse of the velocity that best flatten the target seismic event (Figure IV.41). \n\nAll of these assumptions and principles are however only valid in the case of horizontal \n\nlayers. The equations and the principles change when a more realistic model with several \n\ndipping-layers is considered. The dipping layers moveout can be corrected with the so \n\ncalled Dip Moveout process (explained further in the text \u2013 Flow 6). \n\n \n\nFigure IV.41 \u2013 NMO corrections: A) CMP gather containing a single event with a moveout velocity \nof 2260m/s; B) NMO-corrected gather using the appropriate moveout velocity; C) NMO-corrected \ngather using a low velocity \u2013 overcorrection effect; D) NMO-corrected gather using a high velocity - \nundercorrection effect (modified from Yilmaz, 1987). \n\n \n\nCMP Stack \n\nCommon-midpoint stacking is the most important data-processing step in improving the \n\nimaging quality of the data. The principles involved have already been shortly discussed \n\nalong with the field procedures used to acquire the data (multicoverage acquisition). The \n\ntraces within a common-midpoint gather are summed, along horizontal NMO-corrected \n\nseismic events, to yield a single stacked trace. A CMP stacked section is often regarded \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n96 \n \n\nas a zero-offset section, especially after migration is performed on the data (Yilmaz, \n\n2001a).  \n\nThe stacking of a seismic section severely increases the overall signal-to-noise ratio and \n\nattenuates most multiples. Common-midpoint stacking ordinarily assumes that all traces in \n\nthe gather being stacked have equal validity and thus should be given equal weight. The \n\noutput amplitude is divided by the number of live traces which were summed during the \n\nstack, that is, adjustments are made for muted and occasional missing or dead traces \n\n(Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). Other options, as weighted stacking are also possible in most \n\nprocessing software packages. \n\nIn the case of the processing shown here, the velocities analysis previously performed for \n\neach seismic event of interest, was recorded into a SPW Velocity Card, and applied for \n\nthe NMO corrections at each CMP. Combining a sequence of common-midpoint gathers \n\nafter NMO correction yields a common-midpoint stack. \n\nThe created SPW flow for the CMP Stack is composed of: an input seismic file, linked to \n\nthe Apply Normal Moveout process, which has also a the previously created Velocity Card \n\nas input. The output seismic file is the Stack Seismic File itself (Figure IV.42; Figure \n\nIV.43). \n\n \n\nFigure IV.42 \u2013 CMP stack seismic process (see explanation in the text). \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n97 \n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.43 \u2013 Stack processing in the SPW Flowchart. The constant velocity of 1500m/s on the \nApply Normal Moveout card is ignored due to the fact that there is a Velocity Picks Card input. \nInstead velocities in this Velocity Picks Card will be used (rms velocities). \n\n \n\nAs a quality check step, before the CMP Stack, a simple header manipulation with the \n\nTrace Header Cell Math tool was performed. This manipulation step writes directly on the \n\nseismic file a user-defined number on the Survey ID column. Having different seismic files \n\nwith different numbers of Survey ID allows the application of a Merge Seismic process \n\nwhich will merge up to 4 different seismic files (Figure IV.44). This output can then be \n\ndisplayed on SeisViewer, and changing the Survey ID number can be very helpful to \n\nquickly compare non-processed with processed seismic sections, or even compare the \n\nsame processing step with different parameterizations. \n\n \n\nFigure IV.44 \u2013 Seismic stack processing and application of a Seismic Merge processing step. \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n98 \n \n\nComplete Flow \n\nThe complete flow, 2\u2013Test Stack, is composed of: a constant velocity stack, a stack with a \n\nvelocity model from velocity analysis, and a Seismic Merge to compare the results from \n\nthe different seismic processing steps(Figure IV.45). This Flow 2 will be later used during \n\nprocessing, to check the quality and consistency of the processing flow. \n\n \n\nFigure IV.45 \u2013 SPW?s seismic processing flow 2\u2013Test Stack. \n\n \n\nOne example of CMP Stacks from one seismic line processed in the scope of this thesis is \n\nshown in Figure IV.46. \n\n \n\nIV.3.2.4 FLOW 3 - Deconvolution \n\nDeconvolution is a process that, if well parameterized improves the temporal resolution of \n\nseismic data by compressing the seismic wavelet. Deconvolution can be applied before \n\nand/or after stack (Yilmaz, 2001a). Besides the wavelet compression, the deconvolution \n\nprocess can significantly remove part of the source-receiver ghost and the seafloor \n\nmultiple energy from the section, particularly when using predictive deconvolution. \n\nHowever, this multiple attenuation is not always efficient. \n\nOn the recorded seismic trace, the acoustic impedance contrast between sucessive layers \n\ncauses the reflections that are recorded along a subsurface profile. Thus, the recorded \n\nseismogram can be modeled as a convolution of the Earth?s impulse response with the \n\nseismic wavelet, generated by the seismic source. The Earth?s impulse response \n\ncomprises primary reflections (reflectivity series) and all possible multiples created during \n\nthe seismic energy propagation inside the Earth. This impulse response is\n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n99 \n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.46 \u2013 Stacked seismic of line GB-23. \n\n \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n100 \n \n\nwhat would be recorded if the generated seismic wavelet was just a spike. Ideally, \n\ndeconvolution should compress the wavelet components and in this way eliminate \n\nmultiples, leaving the intrinsic Earth?s reflectivity in the seismic record (Yilmaz, 2001a). \n\nTo explain the Deconvolution process a brief description of the convolution model is \n\nintroduce. As already stated before, the seismic records are generated by the convolution \n\nof the seismic wavelet with the Earth?s reflectivity series. If there were no noise, the \n\nseismic section will be formed of simple reflections at each geological boundary between \n\nlayers with different physical properties (density and velocity). This linear process is called \n\nthe Principle of Superposition (Yilmaz, 2001a; Figure IV.47). \n\n \n\nFigure IV.47 \u2013 Convolution model; synthetic seismogram. A wavelet travelling in the Earth repeats \nitself when it encounters a reflector along its path (b,c,d,e,f). The left column represents the \nreflections coefficients, while the right column represents the response of the wavelet. Amplitudes \nof the response are scaled by the reflection coefficient. The resulting seismogram (bottom right) \nrepresents the composite response of the Earth?s reflectivity (bottom left) to the wavelet (in Yilmaz, \n1987). \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n101 \n \n\nThis theoretical assumption is not achievable in real situations, and the seismic traces will \n\nbe composed of reflections from each interface and by noise (environmental noise, noise \n\nfrom the equipments, and acquisition conditions, etc., Equation 8). Depending on the \n\nfrequency of the seismic wavelet and the spacing between interfaces, the seismic record \n\nmay be affected also by interference effects. A more realistic representation of a record \n\nseismogram is shown in Figure IV.48. \n\n \n\nFigure IV.48 \u2013 The recorded seismogram (bottom image) is the sum of the noise-free seismogram \n\nand noise (modified from Yilmaz, 1987). \n\n \n\nThe parameters of the Convolution Model are described by (Equation 8): \n\n \n\n                     (Eq.8) \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n102 \n \n\nwhere x(t) is the recorded seismogram, w(t) is the basic seismic wavelet, e(t) is the \n\nEarth?s impulse response, n(t) random ambient noise, and   denotes the convolution \n\noperator. \n\nIn order to better image closely spaced reflecting boundaries (thin layering), the source \n\nwaveform must be compressed to obtain the desired sparse spike series (the reflectivity \n\nseries; Yilmaz, 2001a). This removal process is just the opposite of the convolution \n\nprocess, and therefore referred to as deconvolution. Deconvolution tries to recover the \n\nreflectivity series, i.e. the impulse response from the subsurface, from the recorded \n\nseismogram (Yilmaz, 2001a). \n\nThe original source waveform w(t) is normally not totally known. However, in certain cases \n\nthe source wavelet may be partly known by deploying seismic receivers the closest \n\npossible to the source. Nevertheless, what is measured is only the waveform at the \n\nsource point and not the wavelet that is recorded at the receiver, which is considerably \n\ndifferent due to the low-pass filter character of the Earth?s subsurface. In addition, another \n\ndrawback is the lack of a priori knowledge of the ambient noise, n(t) (Yilmaz, 2001a).  \n\nOver the years, deconvolution has become an effective method to increase temporal \n\nresolution, in spite of the difficulties discussed. To solve for the unknown e(t) in equation \n\n8, the noise component must be assumed to be zero, and an approximate waveform is \n\nassumed. Due to these assumptions the convolutional and the deconvolution models \n\nhave to be dealt in time and frequency domains. If the source waveform is known, then \n\nthe solution to the deconvolution problem is deterministic and we use inverse filtering to \n\nfind the Earth response. If the source waveform is unknown (the usual case), then the \n\nsolution to the deconvolution problem is statistical or predictive, and we usually use \n\npredictive deconvolution to find the Earth response. The Wiener prediction\n4\n theory \n\nprovides a good and satisfactory method for statistical deconvolution (for further details \n\nYilmaz, 2001a). \n\nThe deconvolution process used in this work was a Predictive. Therefore, this will be the \n\nonly method which will be further described in the scope of this thesis (for further \n\ninformation see Yilmaz, 2001a; Chapter 2 - 83-152pp). \n\nAs mentioned before, in a seismic record, what is usually know is the seismic trace x(t), \n\nand although the source wavelet is usually unknown, the seismogram-wavelet relation can \n\n                                                \n4\n  - A casual filter which will transform an input into a desired output as nearly as possible in least-\n\nsquare sense, implying that the sum of the squares of differences between the filter output and the \ndesired result is minimized. \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n103 \n \n\nbe used to compute a scaled version of it and used during the processing of the data \n\ninstead. The desired output of a Deconvolution is the Earth?s response e(t), which is \n\nunknown because of its random nature. For these reasons, it is not possible to use normal \n\nequations (as the one shown in equation 8) directly; however, we can still use them if we \n\nrequire the desired output to be a time-advanced version x (t+ ?) of the input x(t), where ? \n\nis called the prediction lag, which can be easily calculated (Robinson and Treitel, 1980; \n\nYilmaz, 2001a). \n\nIn practice, to apply a Predictive Deconvolution it is necessary to set-up a set of \n\nparameters such as: the operator length, the prediction lag, and the pre-whitening factor. \n\nThis selection is highly dependent on the characteristics of the autocorrelation of the \n\nseismic traces. Therefore, it is important to run an autocorrelation of the data to choose \n\nthe suitable autocorrelation window (gate). This autocorrelation step is then used to define \n\nthe deconvolution parameters. The autocorrelation window should include the part of the \n\nrecord that contains useful reflection signal and should exclude coherent (e. g., ground \n\nroll) or incoherent noise (e. g., later parts of the record). Its length should also be about \n\neight to ten times the largest operator length that will be used on the Deconvolution \n\nprocess (Yilmaz, 2001a) \n\nA Predictive Deconvolution, using a prediction filter with length n and prediction lag ?, \n\nconverts a given source wavelet of length (n+?) into another wavelet that is ? samples \n\nlonger. Depending on ?, the Deconvolution can be spiking or predictive. For spiking \n\ndeconvolution ? is equal to 1, and for a predictive deconvolution the prediction lags ? is \n\ngreater than 1. This last method is better applied to predict and suppress multiples or \n\nghosts. If the prediction lag is increased, the output from the predictive deconvolution \n\nbecomes less spiky, because the amplitude spectrum becomes more band-limited and \n\nwith less bandwidth. Applying a band-pass filter after a deconvolution is not the equivalent \n\nof a predictive deconvolution with ? > 1. The use of spiking deconvolution should be \n\nlimited, since it may boost high-frequency noise in the data. \n\nIn the case of using a predictive Deconvolution (? > 1) for multiple suppressing, the \n\nselection of ? depends on the type of multiple:  \n\n? Long-path multiples: ? should be selected equal to the beginning of first multiple \n\non the autocorrelogram; \n\n? Short-path multiples: ? should be selected equal to the first or second zero \n\ncrossing on the autocorrelogram (In the processing work presented on this thesis, \n\nthe second zero of the autocorrelation function was chosen). \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n104 \n \n\nThe amplitude spectrum of the spiking deconvolution operator (inverse filter) is \n\napproximately the reciprocal of that of the source wavelet. If the amplitude spectrum of the \n\nsource wavelet had zeros, then the amplitude spectrum of the inverse filter will be \n\nunstable (i. e., it will be infinite at these points). To ensure numerical stability, an artificial \n\nlevel of random (white) noise is added before the Deconvolution process itself. This \n\nprocess is called prewhitening and is achieved by adding white noise, with a very small \n\nvariance, to the amplitude spectrum of the source wavelet (Yilmaz, 2001a). \n\nUnder the scope of this work, a Predictive Deconvolution was applied to the seismic data \n\nin order to increase the vertical resolution of the data, to attenuate the waterbottom \n\nmultiple, and also to attenuate the ghost that is present on shallower part of the seismic \n\nprofiles (this effect was already described in Figure IV.46). \n\nIn the SPW, the Deconvolution process there is the possibility to apply a spiking or \n\npredictive deconvolution to the data. It is also possible to define the percentage of pre-\n\nwhitening, the filter length, the number of operators, the overlap of the operator design \n\nwindows, the start time of the first operator design window, and the design window \n\nlengths. For the predictive deconvolution method, we must specify the predictive length of \n\nthe wavelet. The SPW Deconvolution process card is shown in Figure IV.49. \n\n \n\nFigure IV.49 \u2013 Parameters used in the Deconvolution process  \n\n \n\nWaterbottom Picking \n\nTo perform the Predictive Deconvolution for the attenuation of the waterbottom multiple, \n\nthe time corresponding to the seafloor was picked as a horizon and used as the input for \n\nthe Deconvolution process, acting as a prediction horizon. This picking was performed on \n\na stacked seismic section, using the SeisViewer application (Figure IV.50). \n\n\n\nChapter IV.

As already \n\nmentioned before, each CMP location is located half the horizontal distance between the \n\nsource and the receiver (considering that the source and the receiver are at the same \n\ndepth). If multiple sources and receivers are used and the spacing between the sources \n\nand receivers is set-up correctly, more than one source receiver pair will have the same \n\nmidpoint. This means that several reflections are obtained from the same subsurface \n\nreflection location and the acquisition is considered has therefore multifold coverage. \n\nThe CMP Sort processing step converts seismic files ordered by shot point location (shot \n\ngather) into seismic files sorted by common midpoint locations (CMP gather). A shot \n\ngather has all stations that recorded a single shot and a common midpoint gather has all \n\nthe shot-receiver pairs that have the same midpoint location. \n\nFor this purpose, in SPW FlowChart a General Trace Sort step was used, which allows \n\nthe sorting of the input seismic traces according to primary, secondary, and optional \n\ntertiary keys. In this case, the key words correspond to the trace header fields (Figure \n\nIV.58). \n\n \n\nFigure IV.58 \u2013 CMP Sort using a General Trace Sort step. \n\n \n\nThe Primary Sort Key controls the sort type of the output records. The Secondary Sort \n\nKey controls the sort type of the traces of these output records. These two sort keys are \n\nmandatory. The Tertiary Sort Key is optional and controls sorting of duplicate trace types \n\n\n\nChapter IV.

A bin defines how the sorted data type is grouped. A bin size can \n\nbe as small as one or include many traces. The bin interval is the number of locations to \n\nskip to reach the next location for output. The range limits allows limiting the location in \n\nthe output to the specific range of location required for further analysis and processing. \n\nThis CMP Sort processing step was applied to the previuous deconvolved seismic file, in \n\norder to sort the seismic data by CMP location, to be used on the next processing steps. \n\n  The complete processing flow is presented in Figure IV.59. \n\n \n\nFigure IV.59 \u2013 SPW processing flow 4 \u2013 CMP Sort. \n\n \n\nIV.3.2.6 FLOW 5 - Radon DeMultiple  \n\nThe main multiple attenuation methods are commonly divided in two categories: (1) \n\nmethods that predict the multiples from the data itself, and (2) those that recur to moveout \n\nseparation between multiples and primaries seismic events. Among the first group of \n\ntechniques are those methods denominated as surface related multiple elimination \n\n(SRME), wave-field extrapolation, and predictive deconvolution. On the other hand, \n\nmoveout methods are those based on F-K or Radon transforms. Both categories have \n\ntheir own very different set of strengths and weaknesses.  \n\nAs advantages of this methods they are methods relatively cheap and reliable, and can do \n\nan excellent job of discriminating between primaries and multiples seismic events in cases \n\nwhere certain assumptions are satisfied. However, they require an intensive computation, \n\nand for those cases where the theoretical assumptions are not satisfied these methods \n\nhave an unstable behavior. As a workaround for the methods? limitations different \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n112 \n \n\ndemultiple techniques are sometimes cascaded in the processing sequence to address \n\nthe widest possible range of multiple issues. \n\nDemultiple techniques based on moveout differences usually involve a transformation of \n\nthe data to some other domain different from the time-space one, enabling the clear and \n\nnatural separation of the primary and multiple seismic events. In the transform domain the \n\nprimaries can be muted and the multiples transformed back to the time-space domain and \n\nbe subtracted from the input data. The most popular transform for this purpose is the \n\nRadon Transform (e.g. Hampson and Dunham, 1985; Hampson, 1987; Yilmaz, 1988; \n\nHargreaves et al., 2001; PGS, 2008) \n\nIn its conventional form the Radon transform is used to model pre-stack data as a set of \n\nparabolic events which best fit the data in a least-squares sense (Hampson, 1986). \n\nUnfortunately, the conventional Radon transform has some limitations related to its spatial \n\naperture and spatial sampling which can cause mis-focusing of energy in the transform \n\ndomain.  \n\nThe simplest Radon transform is computed by summing the data in the space-time \n\ndomain along straight lines with a range of dips, and then mapping the results onto a grid \n\nof intercept time, ?, and time dip, p. This linear Radon transform is sometimes called a \n\nslant stack (Figure IV.60).  \n\n \n\nFigure IV.60 \u2013 Several different arrivals (A, B, C and D) on a CMP gather (left image, t-x domain) \n\nmapped onto the corresponding ?- p gather (A?, B?, C? and D?) (modified from Yilmaz, 1987). \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n113 \n \n\nAs shown on Figure IV.61 the left image schemes give a basic illustration for original data \n\nin the time-offset domain (t-x). The parameters used to define the family of lines determine \n\nthe dimensions of the transform space. This implies a dip-intercept transform domain (?-?) \n\nas shown on the right hand side. The three represented events in the t-x domain are \n\ntransformed into three points in the ?- p space. \n\nIn the Radon domain, multiples can be removed by muting those parabolas that represent \n\nthe multiple curvatures. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.61 - Schematic representation of mapping seismic events in the t-x domain to positions \nin Radon domain: a) represents the linear transform; b) illustrates the parabolic transform. In both \ncase seismic data in t-x is summed along the shown trajectories, and the output result is the \ncorresponding positions in the Radon domain (modified from PGS, 2008). \n\n \n\nAn alternative to the standard decomposition is the high-resolution Radon transform \n\n(Sacchi and Ulrych, 1995). This overcomes the limitations of the standard algorithm by \n\nconstraining the algorithm so that it departs from the standard least-squares solution. \n\nInstead, it performs a sparse decomposition of the input and represents the data by fewer \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n114 \n \n\nevents in the Radon domain. The high-resolution Radon Transform can be applied on the \n\nfrequency domain or in the time domain (Hargreaves et al., 2001; PGS, 2008). \n\n \n\nApplication of Radon Demultiple \n\nThe Radon demultiple technique was applied to tackle the seabottom multiple, since the \n\nPredictive Deconvolution was unsuccessful on this task. The SPW Radon Demultiple \n\nprocessing step performs a parabolic radon demultiple through modeling of the multiples \n\nin the parabolic radon domain. The modeled multiple reflections are then subtracted from \n\nthe original data in the time domain.  \n\nIn SPW, the Radon Demultiple processing step must be set-up in terms of transform type, \n\nthe range of ray parameters in the output transform, and the spatial and temporal taper \n\nlengths (Figure IV.62).  \n\n \n\nFigure IV.62 \u2013 Radon Demultiple processing card. \n\n \n\nOn this processing step it is required to sort the data into an offset-ordered, to have a \n\noffset-ordered seismic output file. This sort may be done recurring to header manipulation \n\nusing the SPW process called Trace Headers Column Math and Trace Header Cell Math \n\n(see Appendix). The header operations will create a seismic data with one offset gather \n\nfor each CMP Location, in order to increase the resolution in each CMP Location. The \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n115 \n \n\nRadon Demultiple is always preceded by a NMO correction (red dotted box in Figure \n\nIV.63). The complete Radon Demultiple processing flow is shown in Figure IV.63. \n\n \n\nFigure IV.63  \u2013 Radon Demultiple processing flow. The header operation performed by the various \nTrace Header Cell Math steps are described in detail in the Appendix. \n\n \n\nTail Mute \n\nTo complement the imaging enhancement provided by the Radon Demultiple a tail mute \n\nwas applied to the data in order to attenuate the strong remaining multiple energy. \n\nThe SPW Tail Mute process is a normal mute, which zeroes the amplitudes of the \n\nselected traces within a user-defined area. The resulting Tail Mute picks file card is \n\napplied to the output seismic file of the Radon Demultiple, process (Figure IV.64). The \n\npicked mute will zeroe the amplitudes of the first arrivals for the near traces below the first \n\nseabed multiple in the Radon Demultiple output gathers (Figure IV.64a). To identify the \n\nremaining hyperbola that corresponds to the multiple, a stacked seismic section of the \n\nRadon Demultiple output can be displayed side by side with the previous window \n\nmentioned (Figure IV.64b). \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n116 \n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.64 \u2013 Tail Mute picking operation on SeisViewer; example of seismic line GB-10b: a) CMP Gather of Radon Demultiple seismic output \n(location 1100); b) Radon Demultiple seismic output stacked; the dotted red line represents the location of the CMP gather presented in a). \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n117 \n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.65 \u2013 Tail Mute processing flow. \n\n \n\nThe tail mute improves the attenuation of the seabottom multiple by reducing the energy \n\ncontent from the first arrivals of the near traces at time depths below the multiple (Figure \n\nIV.66).  \n\nA stacked seismic section conveniently processed with a Radon Demultiple and improved \n\nwith a Tail Mute is shown in Figure IV.66. In this figure, it is clearly observed the \n\nsignificant improvement in the attenuation of the seabottom multiple. The Radon \n\nDemultiple is an essential process to attenuate the unwanted multiple energy in the \n\nbottom part of the seismic section, to perform correctly the pre-stack time migration. \n\n \n\nComplete Flow \n\nThe main aim of this data processing flow is the attenuation of the seabottom multiple \n\nwhich was not achieved with the Predictive Deconvolution. Combining the Radon \n\nDemultiple with a Tail Mute, the seabottom multiple energy was successfully attenuated. \n\nThe final seismic processing Flow 5 is presented in Figure IV.67. \n\n \n\nIV.3.2.7 FLOW 6 - Pre-Stack Time Migration \n\nThe final result of the processing operations is normally a zero-offset seismic time section. \n\nConventional stacked sections represent a zero-offset seismic time section where each \n\nseismic trace is plotted vertically below the source-receiver position regardless of the true \n\nposition and dip of the reflecting interface (Hatton et al., 1986;Yilmaz, 2001a). In order to \n\nobtain the true position of each reflection, a process called migration needs to be applied \n\nto the data. . \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n118 \n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.66  \u2013 Radon Demultiple: a) Seismic line GB-10b; b) Seismic line Gb-10b after the Radon \n\nDemultiple; c) Seismic line GB-10b after Radon Demultilple with Tail Mute; M \u2013 multiple.  \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n119 \n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.67  \u2013 SPW?s seismic processing flow 5-Radon Demultiple \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n120 \n \n\nSeismic Migration \n\nSeismic migration is the procedure by which an image of the correctly positioned \n\nsubsurface reflecting interfaces is obtained from a seismic time section Correctly \n\nimplemented, it is a transform from the unmigrated time domain to the migrated time or \n\ndepth domain. In this sense, \u201cmigrated\u201d is synonymous of \u201ccorrectly positioned\u201d, although \n\nin practice, it should be interpreted simply as \u201cre-positioned\u201d. The most important \n\nparameter in the migration process is to estimate a reliable migration velocity model at all \n\nsubsurface positions v(x, y, z;) (Yilmaz, 2001a). \n\nIn areas of steep dip, reflector segments appear on the time section with a considerable \n\noffset from their true position (Figure IV.68a). In a non-migrated zero-offset seismic \n\nsection, the reflection received at X may come from an oblique point A, but is plotted \n\nvertically below X at C, where in two-way time XC = XA (Figure IV.68a). In a non-migrated \n\nsection reflectors are moved downdip from their real position, and show a smaller dip than \n\nthey actually have. More complex geometries arise when the reflector curvature exceeds \n\nthat of the incident wavefront (Figure IV.68b). Reflections received at the same surface \n\nlocation can be originated by more than one reflection point at the subsurface (see \n\nChapter III \u2013 Horizontal Resolution). Migration moves dipping reflections to their true \n\nsubsurface positions and collapses diffractions, resulting from energy scattering in sharp \n\nedges (e.g. faults; see Figure IV.69). Note that migration does not displace horizontal \n\nevents; rather, it moves dipping events in the updip direction and collapses diffractions, \n\nincreasing the  spatial resolution of the subsurface imaging in particular in fault zones. \n\n \n\nFigure IV.68 \u2013 a) Actual event AB is recorded in a apparent location CD; b) reflections from a \n\nconcave reflector; rays from each of the source location (1-10) are reflected from up to three \n\ndifferent points on the concave reflector, the bottom diagram shows a complex pattern of three \n\nreflector curves, commonly know as a \u201cbow-tie\u201d, typical of sinclines (modified from McQuillin et al., \n\n1984). \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n121 \n \n\nAs mentioned before, a concave-upward reflector on the seismic data produces the \n\nfocusing of the seismic wave and originates three reflection points on the folded event per \n\nsurface location (Figure IV.68). This type of geological features normally produces \n\nartifacts in non-migrates seismic section, commonly denominated as bow ties. The \n\nmigration corrects this effect and properly re-positioning the seismic events to their real \n\nposition (Sheriff, 1991) (Figure IV.68; Figure IV.69). \n\n \n\nFigure IV.69  \u2013 Migration corrections on synthetic models: a) original synthetic section; b) migrated \n\nsection (modified McQuillin et al., 1984) \n\n \n\nThe goal of the migration is therefore to convert a stacked section into something more \n\nsimilar to a geologic cross-section, where every geologic event is placed in its correct \n\nlocation (Yilmaz, 2001a).  \n\nThe migration process that produces a migrated time section is called Time Migration, and \n\nit is appropriate as long as the computed lateral velocity variations are smooth. When \n\nthere are important lateral velocity gradients, time migration does not produce a proper \n\nsubsurface image and instead it is necessary to perform a depth migration, with ray trace \n\nmodeling. In that, the output is a depth section (Yilmaz, 2001a). \n\nWhen migrating a seismic section, two undesirable effects may happen: overmigration \n\nand undermigration. The overmigration is the result of inadequate use of higher seismic \n\nvelocities than the correct ones. On the contrary, undermigrated events occur when lower \n\nvelocities than the corrected ones are used for this migration. \n\nThere are different types of migration algorithms available by computing filters operating \n\nacross many traces: \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n122 \n \n\na) Algorithms based on differential methods: finite difference techniques \n\nimplemented in t \u2013 x and f-x domains; \n\nb) Algorithms implemented in the FK domain: FK and Phase shift migration \n\nmethods; \n\nc) Algorithms based on integral methods: Kirchhoff method. \n\n \n\nThe first common migration technique was the semicircle superposition method that was \n\nused before the digital era. Then this migration algoritm was replaced by the diffraction-\n\nsummation technique which is based on summing the seismic amplitudes along a \n\ndiffraction hyperbola whose curvature is governed by the medium velocity. The Kirchhoff \n\nsummation technique was introduced later (Schneider, 1978) and basically is the same \n\nprinciple applied in the diffraction summation technique improved with both corrections for \n\namplitudes and phase before the summation of the data data. These corrections make the \n\nsummation consistent with the wave equation since they account for the spherical \n\nspreading, the obliquity factor (angle-dependency of amplitudes), and the phase shift \n\ninherent to Huygen?s secondary source. Another migration technique is based on the idea \n\nthat a stacked section can be modeled as an upcoming zero-offset wave field generated \n\nby exploding reflectors (Claerbout and Doherty, 1972). Using that model, migration can be \n\nconceptualized as consisting of a wave field extrapolation (in the form of downward \n\nacoustic field continuation) followed by imaging (for further detail see X, 2001 \u2013 Chapter \n\n4). Downward continuation of wavefields can be implemented conveniently using finite-\n\ndifference solutions to the scalar wave equation. Migration methods based on such \n\nimplementations are called finite-difference migration. Claerbout (1985) has provided a \n\ncomprehensive theoretical foundation of finite-difference migration and its practical \n\naspects. After the developments on Kirchhoff summation and finite-diference migrations, \n\nStolt (1978) introduced migration by Fourier transform. The Stolt method is based on a \n\nconstant-velocity assumption; however, Stolt modified his method to handle the types of \n\nvelocity for which time migration is acceptable by stretching the time axis to account for \n\nvelocity variations. Another frequency-wave number migration is the phase-shift method \n\n(Gazdag, 1978). This method is based on the idea that downward continuation amounts to \n\na phase shift in the frequency-wavenumber domain (Yilmaz, 2001a). For further details on \n\nthese and other migration algorithms please refer to Yillmaz (2001a). \n\nThe migration algorthims can be applied after stack, in which casa they are called post-\n\nstack migration; they can also be applied before the stack in pre-stack migration. However \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n123 \n \n\nsome algorithms give better results when applied in pre- or post-stack data, as further \n\ndiscussed in this text. Regardless of the migration algorithm used, the interpretability of a \n\nmigrated section is dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio, on the velocities used in \n\nmigration, and on the quality of the stacked section (when we are dealing with post-stack \n\ndata; Yilmaz, 2001a). \n\n \n\nDip Moveout Correction \n\nDip-Moveout (DMO) correction is applied to normal-moveout corrected pre-stack data to \n\nresolve conflicting dips with different stacking velocities during stacking. As a result, DMO \n\ncorrection yields an improved stacked section that is a closer representation of a zero-\n\noffset section compared to a conventional CMP stack based only on a normal-moveout \n\ncorrection. A dip moveout corrected section better mimics the assumptions of zero-offset \n\nthat are implicit in a migration of a seismic section (Yilmaz, 2001a).  \n\nThe difference in the arrival times, measured by receivers at two different offset locations, \n\nof a reflected wave in a dipping plan is called the Dip-Moveout effect (Figure IV.70). \n\n \n\nFigure IV.70 \u2013 DMO moves the data to the correct zero-offset trace for a dipping reflection after the \n\nreflection position has been corrected for the Normal Moveout effect; migration moves it to the \n\nsubsurface location (in Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). \n\n \n\nIn a dipping interface, the trace of a CMP gather does not corresponds to a true common \n\nreflection midpoint, resulting in a smearing of the received energy. The Dip-Moveout \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n124 \n \n\ncorrection is a seismic processing operation that corrects the dipping effect of the \n\nreflector. DMO processing was developed in the early 1980s, and since that, several \n\nadvances to dip moveout were performed (Hale and Artley, 1993; Liner and Lines, 1994; \n\nWang, 1995). \n\nWhile conventional normal-moveout correction involves only a time shift, dip-moveout \n\ncorrection involves mapping in both the time and the space. This means that dip-moveout \n\ncorrection, in a strictly way, is not a moveout correction in conventional terms; rather, it is \n\na process of partial migration applied to common-offset data. In fact, this process maps \n\nthe nonzero-offset data to the plane of zero-offset. The DMO corrected section is then \n\nfully migrated using a zero-offset migration operator (Yilmaz, 2001a). \n\nIn SPW the Dip Moveout processing step is applied as an integral DMO correction as \n\ndescribed by X (see X, 2001, \u201eSeismic Data Analysis?, pp.655-835). This is a summation \n\noperator applied to each source-receiver pair. There are no assumptions about regular \n\ngeometry and the correction can be applied to irregularly spaced CMP gathers. This step \n\noperates on common offset gathers for calculating dip-related NMO corrections. The time \n\n(in milliseconds) that corresponds to a reflection of interest for dip moveout correction, \n\nmust be inserted. The algorithm pads the data volume on the order of four times the trace \n\nlength and width in order to ensure the stability of the algorithm. This SPW?s routine needs \n\nfor input an offset-ordered seismic file (Figure IV.71). \n\n \n\nFigure IV.71 \u2013 Dip Moveout processing flow. The input is the Radon Demultiple output; the Trace \n\nHeader Column Math is applied to load the original offset values (in the previous flow they were \n\nchanged and the copy of the original was stored on the header file User Def 2). \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n125 \n \n\nAt this processing stage, the DMO process, was applied to remove the moveout effects \n\nmore effectively than just using a regular NMO correction. The output of this processing \n\nstep is an improved Semblance spectrum. Getting a quality Semblance spectrum is \n\nessential to perform a detailed velocity analysis to be used for the next processing step, \n\nthe Migration (Figure IV.72). \n\n \n\nFigure IV.72 \u2013 Semblance spectrum before (left image) and after (right image) the Dip Moveout \n\ncorrection. The black dotted boxes represent areas where the improvement of the semblance \n\nresolution is clear. \n\n \n\nAt this stage, as the DMO correction, as indeed improved the Semblance, it is advised to \n\nrebuilt the velocity model by redo the velocity analysis. This new velocity pick will provide \n\na new and accurate velocity model, which will allow a better migration processing. \n\n \n\nPre-Stack Phase-Shift Time Migration \n\nThe pre-stack migration has the same principles as a post-stack migration. However the \n\nmigration algorithm is applied in each CMP gather and not in just each CMP location. It is \n\ntherefore a more time- and computational consumer processing, but it allows, in most of \n\nthe cases, better results, particularly for the deeper positions of the seismic sections. \n\nIn this processing work, in order to get results in a shorter time, a computer cluster \n\ncreated in 2009 at the Geology and Geophysics Laboratory from the University of Aveiro \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n126 \n \n\n(Gandarinho, 2009) was used. This Cluster allowed doing the seismic processing in a \n\nconsiderable shorter time; in particular, it was very useful in heavy processing jobs, such \n\nas Radon Demultiple and Pre-Stack Migration. \n\nTo perform the pre-stack migration the Phase-Shift migration algorithm was chosen as the \n\nalgorithm which gives better results on this dataset. The theory of the frequency-number (f \n\n\u2013 k) migration techniques can be consulted in Yilmaz (2001a) (Section D.7). For this \n\npurpose, a briefly review of the f-k migration algorithm is presented (Yilmaz, 2001a): \n\ni) Like any other migration algorithm, it starts with the scalar wave equation; \n\nii) Constant velocities are assumed constant and perform 3D Fourier transform \n\nand obtain the dispersion relation between the transforms variables; \n\niii) Then, the dispersion relations are adopted to the exploding reflectors model by \n\nhaving the velocity for the upcoming waves; \n\niv) Operate on the pressure wavefield P and do the inverse transform in z to \n\nobtain the differential equation; \n\nv) Obtain a solution. \n\n \n\nThe discrete form of this solution is the basis for phase-shift migration in which velocity \n\ncan be varied at each depth step in the vertical direction. The phase-shift method \n\n(Gazdag, 1978) can only handle vertically varying velocities. A way to accommodate \n\nlateral velocity variations judged to be acceptable is to first stretch the the CMP gather in \n\nthe time direction so as to make it correspond to a velocity field v(z) that only varies \n\nvertically (Yilmaz, 2001a). This velocity field is associated with the unstretched CMP-\n\nstacked section in the x direction. Following the stretching operation, the stacked section \n\nis migrated using the velocity function v(z) in the standard phase-shift migration scheme. \n\nFinally the migrated section is unstretched (Gazdag, 1978; Yilmaz, 2001a). The Gazdag?s \n\nFlowChart for a phase-shit migration is presented in Figure IV.73. \n\nIn this seismic processing work the phase-shift algorithm was chose to perform the pre-\n\nstack time migration of the seismic lines. However, other algorithms were tested too. For \n\nexample, the Stolt method (Stolt, 1978) was also used, but yielded poorer results. A \n\nVelocity Card with the velocity model loaded was linked to both migration methods.  \n\nThe Stolt migration, the first to be tested due to its faster algorithm, needs rms velocities, \n\nor in other words, the velocities that are originally picked. \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n127 \n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.73  \u2013 Gazdag?s flow for a Phase-Shift Migration processing (in X, 2001a). \n\n \n\nFor instance, the velocity card which was used for the NMO correction can directly be \n\nused to provide velocity information to the Stolt algorithm. The phase-shift migration does \n\nnot work with rms velocities. Interval velocities are required to perform a good migration \n\nwith this algorithm. As such, the Dix?s Equation to convert the rms velocities into interval \n\nvelocities, vint, was used. The Dix?s Equation (Dix, 1955) states that (Equation 9): \n\n \n\n       \n  \n\n         \n     \n\n       \n \n\n \n\nwhere vn and vn-1 are the rms velocities at the layer boundaries n and n-1, respectively; \n\nand tn and tn-1 are the horizon times at these layer boundaries. Vint refers to the interval \n\nvelocities. \n\nIn SPW the Dix\u2019s Equation step will convert the rms velocity function card into a interval \n\nvelocity card. The new velocity card can be use as the input into a Phase-Shift migration \n\nprocess. This conversion can be easily and quickly performed in the SPW FlowChart \n\n(Figure IV.74) \n\n(Eq. 9) \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n128 \n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.74  \u2013 Conversion of rms velocities into interval velocities using the Dix Equation. \n\n \n\nThe processing flow for both migrations is shown in Figure IV.75 and in Figure IV.76. With \n\nthe same velocity model, pre-stack phase-shift migration always gave better results than \n\nStolt?s algorithm. Therefore, in spite of more time consuming, the Phase-Shift migration \n\nalgorithm was always used in this work, due to its better results. \n\n \n\nFigure IV.75 \u2013 Stolt Migration processing flow. \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n129 \n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.76 \u2013 Phase-Shift Migration processing flow. \n\n \n\nIn order to produce the final migrated section a stack needs then to be computed. For this \n\npurpose, as the NMO and DMO were already corrected, a simple CMP sort card linked to \n\na Seismic Stack Output, followed by a stack step is the flow required to stack correctly the \n\nseismic section (Figure IV.77). \n\n \n\nComplete Flow \n\nThe complete flow of the Pre-Stack Time Migration build on SPW FlowChart module is \n\nshown below (Figure IV.77) \n\n \n\nFigure IV.77 \u2013 SPW?s seismic processing flow 6\u2013Pre-Stack Time Migration. \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n130 \n \n\nIV.3.2.8 FLOW 7 - Post-Stack Time Migration \n\nA post-stack time migration was also performed during the data processing work. This will \n\nallow to compare the both time migrations (pre- and post-stack) and will allow to improve \n\nthe resolution of the seismic events on the upper part of the seismc sections, in particular \n\nthe faults.The Radon Demultiple seismic file output was stacked and a Kirkchhoff post-\n\nstack migration algorithm was applied. \n\n \n\nKirkchhoff Migration \n\nKirchhoff migration is a non recursive method of seismic migration that uses the integral \n\nform (Kirchhoff equation) of the wave equation. The Kirchhoff migration method uses the \n\nsame geometric and seismic wave-front principles as the diffraction summation method. \n\nThe Kirchhoff method considers the origin of the diffraction curve (apex) to be the location \n\nof the true point reflector. This method is based on Huygens?s Principle, according to \n\nwhich, the seismic reflector is viewed as if it is composed of closely spaced point \n\ndiffractions (Claerbout, 1985; Yilmaz, 2001a). The migration of a seismic section is \n\nachieved by collapsing each diffraction hyperbola to its (apex) and each point on the \n\nmigrated section is treated independently from the other points. Each point on the output \n\nmigrated section is produced by adding all data values along a diffraction that is centered \n\nat that point. The Kirchhoff migration corrects the amplitudes and phase for three factors \n\nbefore summing (Yilmaz, 2001a). First, the method corrects for the angle at which each \n\nevent arrives at each receiver. The energy from a point reflector arrives at the receivers at \n\ndifferent angles. This phenomenon is called the obliquity factor. When the energy arrives \n\nat the surface, the receivers near the point of image ray arrival record greater amplitude \n\nthan those receivers located at some distance from this location. Before the summation, \n\nan obliquity, or directivity, correction factor to the amplitudes is therefore applied (Yilmaz, \n\n2001a). The second correction is the spherical divergence, or spreading factor, already \n\nexplained before. The third factor in the Kirchhoff migration method is a correction to \n\nrestore amplitude and phase from distortions that occur during wavefront propagation. \n\nThis correction is called the wave shaping factor. In Kirchhoff migration, the back \n\npropagation (or continuation) of the seismic wave field from the region where it was \n\nmeasured (Earth's surface or along a borehole) into the region to be imaged, is done by \n\nusing the Kirchhoff integral representation of a field at a given point as a (weighted) \n\nsuperposition of waves propagating from adjacent points and times (Yilmaz, 2001a). \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n131 \n \n\nThis migration algorithm was chosen to perform the post-stack migration of the seismic \n\ndata, to compare with the pre-stack migration seismic files. In Kirchhoff migration, the \n\nmost important parameters are the aperture width used in summation and the maximum \n\ndip to migrate. The Kirchhoff Post-Stack Migration card used on SPW is presented in \n\nFigure IV.78. \n\nTo build the correct processing to perform a good migration, a velocity card must be linked \n\nto the Kirchhoff Post-Stack Migration card. In contrast to the Phase-Shift Migration, and \n\nsimilarly to the Stolt Migration, the Kirchhoff needs an rms velocity function input Figure \n\nIV.78). The input of the Kirchhoff Post-Stack Migration will be the Radon Demultiple \n\nseismic output, previously stacked. \n\n \n\nComplete Flow \n\nThe complete flow of the Kirchhoff Post-Stack Migration build on SPW?s FlowChart \n\nmodule is presented in Figure IV.78. \n\n \n\nFigure IV.78 \u2013 SPW seismic processing flow 7 \u2013 Post-Stack Time Migration. \n\n \n\nIV.3.2.9 FLOW 8 - Bandwidth Extension \n\nResolution is the ability to identify individual features or details in a given image, and \n\nseismic resolution involves both vertical (temporal) and horizontal (spatial) resolution. \n\nTemporal resolution is a function of the frequency content of a given signal. Achieving \n\noptimal thin bed resolution requires a broadband spectrum. Since most seismic is very \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n132 \n \n\nband-limited it is desirable to extend the bandwidth of the data in a manner that is both \n\nverifiable and consistent with the geology, but it is important not to create artificial events \n\n(Smith et al., 2008). \n\nIn seismic processing, many methods are employed to extend the bandwidth of the signal \n\nwhile maintaining an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio. Many deconvolution processes, \n\nsuch as spiking, attempt to sharpen the wavelet. Spectral whitening is also often \n\nemployed to boost frequencies, most often on the high end (but sometimes on the low end \n\nas well) (Smith et al., 2008). In a general way, these processes tend to increase the noise \n\nlevel more than the signal and the amount of improvement expected is usually \n\nsubstantially less than an octave, which is where the most problems are (Smith et al., \n\n2008). However, new methods have been introduced which produce results that compare \n\nfavorably to both well log synthetic seismograms and to geologic conditions (e.g., high \n\nfrequency imaging; Hamarbatan et al., 2006). Most of these methods have concentrated \n\non extending the upper end of the spectrum but, especially when one is going to invert the \n\nseismic data, extending the lower end is also very desirable (Smith et al., 2008).  \n\n \n\nBandwidth Extension Method \n\nA method called Bandwidth Extension was developed utilizing the Continuous Wavelet \n\nTransform (CWT) to extend the signal frequencies in both directions. Extending the \n\nbandwidth of a signal, both in the high end and the low end of the spectrum, has been a \n\ngoal of seismic data acquisition and processing for a long time (Yilmaz, 2001a; Smith et \n\nal., 2008) (Figure IV.79). Spectral broadening, primarily high frequency extension, has \n\nbeen a controversial subject because of the belief that, due to the earth absorption of \n\npreferentially high frequencies, these are lost and it is impossible to restore them to the \n\nspectrum. However, several techniques, like Q-compensation (e.g.,Wang, 2006) have \n\nproven this assumption incorrect.  \n\nExtension of bandwidth using harmonics and sub-harmonics predicted and computed with \n\nthe CWT, will enhance the seismic resolution allowing a more refined and detailed \n\ninterpretation. There are limitations: the sampling theorem limits the maximum \n\nrecoverable reflectivity to Nyquist and anti-aliasing filters will set this limit below Nyquist. \n\nAlso, frequencies available for harmonic prediction and limits introduced by a hard cut-off \n\nfield filter and notch filter, as well as the uncertainty principle, affect the ability to extend \n\nbandwidth (Yilmaz, 2001a; Smith et al., 2008). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n133 \n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.79 \u2013 Input data (a) and bandwidth-extended data (b) from an onshore 3D survey. Red \n\ntraces are synthetic seismograms produced from well log reflectivity using an extracted wavelet \n\nfrom the respective data; horizontal timelines are separated by 100 ms (in Smith et al., 2008). \n\n \n\nThe Widess model (Widess, 1973) suggests that there is seismic reflectivity available \n\nbelow one fourth of the dominant frequency wavelength. This information can therefore, in \n\nprinciple, be extracted, resulting in an increase in resolution by adding harmonic and sub-\n\nharmonic frequencies back to the data. In addition, it is well known that it is desirable to \n\nhave at least one and a half octaves, if not two octaves of bandwidth, to decrease side \n\nlobes and remove the \u201eringy? character of seismic data. Once this is done, many features \n\nsuch as minor faults, onlaps, pinch outs, and other stratigraphic subtle features come to \n\nlight. All of these features can have a significant impact on the  interpretation of the \n\nseismic data and subsequent field discoveries (Smith et al., 2008) \n\nThis processing step was adopted to increase the spatial resolution of the multichannel \n\nseismic data. On FlowChart, under the menu of Wavelet Shaping, the process Bandwidth \n\nExtension is available. This processing card can be linked to two seismic files (one acting \n\nas an input, and the other acting as an output file). On the Bandwidth Extension \n\nprocessing step, we can limit the data volume where this processing will be applied, and \n\neven chose the parameters which give better results (Figure IV.80). \n\n \n\nFigure IV.80 \u2013 Bandwidth Extension processing card. \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n134 \n \n\nComplete Flow  \n\nTo apply this seismic processing step, as already mentioned before, two seismic files card \n\nare needed: one input and one output. The complete seismic processing flow and \n\nparameters used are presented in Figure IV.81. The application of this process improved \n\nthe resolution of the seismic profiles, as shown in Figure IV.82. \n\n \n\nFigure IV.81 \u2013 SPW seismic processing flow 8\u2013Bandwidth Extension. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure IV.82 \u2013 Seismic line GB-22 before (a) and after (b) the application of the Bandwidth \n\nExtension, where the vertical resolution improvement is fairly noticed. \n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n135 \n \n\nIV.3.2.10 FLOW 9 - Early Mute \n\nThe seismic processing Early Mute, zeroes the beginning of the seismic traces. This mute \n\nis used to delete the noise preceding the first arrivals, or the area that the user had \n\nspecifies (the beginning and the end time of the mute). In other words, the application of a \n\nMute will kill all the amplitudes of the selected area. \n\n \n\nApply Early Mute \n\nFinished the main processing steps and once obtained a good final seismic profile, the \n\nnext phase is the cleaning of the non-important part of the section. For this particular \n\nwork, the water column was not important. So, an Early Mute was applied to remove the \n\nater column. \n\nIn SPW the processing Mute is achieved by the application of an Early Mute. This Early \n\nMute card is built on the SeisViewer. In SeisViewer, the final stacked seismic file is \n\nopened on a Seismic Window (see Figure IV.84). Then, using the Picks File Option the \n\nEarly Mute option is selected. This operation is performed in exactly same way as the \n\nWaterbottom picks on the Deconvolution flow (Flow 3), changing just the type of pick file \n\nwhich is created (see Figure IV.84). \n\nBack to the FlowChart, this file is linked to an Apply Early Mute card which will link the \n\ninput seismic file to the output seismic file (Figure IV.83). The output seismic file will be \n\nthe same that the input seismic files, but with the amplitudes above the seafloor all zeroes \n\n(Figure IV.85). \n\n \n\nFigure IV.83 \u2013 Apply Early Mute processing flow.\n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n136 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.84 \u2013 Early Mute card picking on SeisViewer applied to the seismic line GB-23; the area above the small red dots will be muted.

After the seismic processing is finished, the \n\nseismic files need to be reconverted to SEG-Y format, so that they can be into other \n\nsoftwares to perform the seismic interpretation. \n\nThe re-convertion to SEG-Y is processed in the same way as the original seismic files \n\nwere converted to SPW internal format. On the I/O Utility, on Data Reformat module, the \n\nprocessed seismic file is loaded and converted to SEG-Y (Figure IV.87). \n\n \n\nFigure IV.87 \u2013 SPW seismic processing flow 9 \u2013 Early Mute.\n\n\n\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n139 \n \n\nAfter this conversion, the processed seismic section can be opened in other seismic \n\nsoftware, such SeisSee, Landmark, Paradigm, Kingdom Suite or Petrel, for example. \n\n \n\nIV. 4 Conclusions \n\nThe seismic processing work carried out in the scope of this thesis, achieved satisfactory \n\nresults, with the final data quality considered to be good to excellent, in particular for the \n\ndeeper part of the seismic sections, which was one of the main aims of this work. Some \n\nmultiple energy still remains in the seismic data, in particular some energy of the \n\nseabottom multiple. However, in most of the seismic lines this multiple energy was much \n\nsuppressed allowing the interpretation of some deeper reflections. \n\nOne of the problems in seismic data over processing is the \u201cfacility to modify\u201d the quality \n\nof the seismic traces, and sometimes gets a final section with several false seismic events \n\nwhich do not truly exist, and lead the interpreter to a serious mistake. In this processing \n\nwork, the true seismic events were maintained as untouched as possible, most of the \n\ntimes were improved, and the unwanted energy, like multiples and frequency noise, were \n\nremoved or attenuated. Attention was also taken to avoid creating artificial events. In \n\nsummary the objectives proposed to the seismic data processing were fully achieved. \n\nVelocity analysis is always a great challenge due to high sensibility of the velocity picking \n\nand lack of focusing of the semblance plots. The velocity analysis carried out on gathers \n\nafter DMO corrections, improved the semblance and allowed a more detailed velocity \n\nmodel. \n\nA clear improvement on the re-processed seismic sections was the removal of the Source \n\nghost. The application of a Predictive Deconvolution, using the second zero of the \n\nautocorrelation function as the predictive length, has totally suppressed this multiple \n\nevent, induced by a gun desynchronization, allowing to see some seismic energy which \n\nwas being masked by this ghost. \n\nWhen the subsurface structures are simple, post-stack migration works well. However, \n\npost-stack migration is not faithful in areas with complex geology and complex variations \n\nin velocities. To overcome this difficulty, pre-stack migration is required which is a better \n\nimaging tool which works quite well in these areas. To image reflections from dipping \n\nevents recorded with today's wide offset acquisitions requires both faithful handling of \n\nvertical velocity gradients and attention of anisotropy are required, which are taken care of \n\nin pre-stack migration. However, post-stack migration is much faster than pre-stack \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n140 \n \n\nmigration, because stacking reduces the number of traces that must be processed. Also, \n\npost-stack migration is cheaper ad less computationally intensive than pre-stack \n\nmigration. However, pre-stack time migration, despite being it time and resources \n\nconsuming generally gives better results than post-stack migration. The use of a pre-stack \n\nmigration algorithm on this dataset was therefore justified due to the improvements \n\nobtained on the seismic sections. \n\nThe application of new processing steps, such as extend the bandwidth of the signal, \n\nwhile maintaining an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio, helped to improve significantly the \n\nvertical resolution of the seismic profiles.  \n\nWith the seismic data re-processing, the quality and resolution of the most seismic lines \n\nwere improved, in particular, the basement and the faults. This improvement was clearly \n\ninfluenced by the accuracy of the velocity model. Indeed, the velocity analysis is \n\nconsidered one of the most important steps in seismic data processing. The several \n\nvelocity models created for each seismic profile (see Figure IV.36; Figure IV.88) were \n\ncreated in order to get the best final seismic profile. Of course, the quality of the final \n\nsection will also depend on the migration algorithm chosen (Phase-Shift, Stolt, Kirkchhoff) \n\nand if it is applied pre- or post-stack. \n\nAs example, we can see on the seismic line GB-10b that with the post-stack Kirchhoff \n\nmigration algorithm, the faults are more clearly, comparing with the onboard processed \n\nseismic profile. Using the same velocity model, but using a pre-stack Phase-Shift time \n\nmigration, the resolution of the faults are not that good, but the basement is more visible. \n\nBoth of the re-processed seismic profiles are better than the preliminary one, due to the \n\nmore carefully velocity analysis better migration algorithms, in particular pre-stack, and \n\nbecause of the bandwidth resolution improvement with the Bandwidth Extension \n\nprocessing (Figure IV.88). \n\nAnother seismic line, that shows a similar improvement is the seismic line GB-22, were \n\nthe basement were not very good on the preliminary processed profile, and where the re-\n\nprocessing improved it definition. This improvement is very usefully for the seismic \n\ninterpretation work, because it makes possible to distinguish the boundary between \n\nlayers. The re-processing of this line was also performed using a post-stack and pre-stack \n\nmigration and the results are shown in Figure IV.89. \n\nAs future wok regarding seismic data processing, it is recommended that an AVO \n\n(Amplitude versus Offset) data processing is considered as a tool to assist the \n\ninterpretation of the data; in particular to study the existence of gas in the sedimentary \n\n\n\nChapter IV.

In this dataset, this procedure was preliminary tested comparing stacked sections \n\nof near- and far-channels, but no supported conclusion were possible to make, due to \n\ntime limitations. \n\nIn summary, the processing flow adopted to perform the re-processing of the 2D \n\nmultichannel seismic data was successful and in the end permitted a considerably quality \n\nimprovement. This seismic data re-processing was essential for the seismic interpretation \n\nwork, mostly because of the basement resolution and visibility improvement, in the most \n\nrepresentative lines. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n142 \n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter IV.

Seismic Data Interpretation of the \nBURATO4240 Survey \n\n \n\n \n\nThis Chapter presents the results from the seismic interpretation of the processed seismic \n\ndata. A brief introduction to seismic interpretation fundamentals and methods is also \n\npresented at the beginning of the chapter. This more detailed interpretation was carried \n\nout using as a basis the preliminary interpretation produced for the cruise report. \n\n \n\nV. 1 Introduction \n\nThe geological significance of a seismic profile and the fundamentals of seismic \n\nacquisition and processing, along with a knowledge of the structural and sedimentary \n\ngeology are the basic materials on which the interpretation skills are built (Jenyon and \n\nFitch, 1985). Seismic reflections are generated at interfaces which may be bedding \n\nplanes, unconformities, fault planes, intrusive contacts or any other boundary between \n\nrocks with different physical properties. \n\nIn seismic interpretation, a fundamental assumption is generally made \u2013 \u201cthere is a one to \n\none correspondence between a seismic arrival and a geological horizon\u201d (Jenyon and \n\nFitch, 1985). The work of the seismic interpreter is most of the times considered \u201cclear \n\nand straightforward\u201d in areas of simple geology and little or no commercial interest for \n\npetroleum purposes, but difficult and complicated in the areas of complex geology and \n\npossible hydrocarbon accumulation, and therefore of a potential commercial interest. \n\nGeologists define stratigraphic surfaces or horizons in several ways. However, the basic \n\ndefinition is in terms of significance time (Jenyon and Fitch, 1985). A geological horizon is \n\ndefined as the top surface of a sedimentary unit laid down at a given moment in time, and \n\nwhich can be defined with a time-stratigraphic or chronostratigraphic significance (Jenyon \n\nand Fitch, 1985). In order to \u201cdate\u201d these horizons, two alternatives or strategies can be \n\nused (e.g. Mitchum and Vail, 1977): \n\n? A first alternative is to use a \u201cbio-stratigraphic\u201d subdivision; based on the \n\nappearance or disappearance of some key fossil, or \u201czone\u201d fossil, which is used to \n\ndate the zone by its presence. \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n148 \n \n\n? A second alternative is the use of a litho-stratigraphic division; this divides the \n\ngeological sequence into the mapped units by the surface geologist or the \n\nsubsurface formations identified by the subsurface geologist. \n\n \n\nContinuity and Correlation on the Seismic Interpretation: \n\nThe work of seismic interpretation can be performed, in the first place, by following two \n\nimportant definitions: continuity and correlation. Continuity is defined as the property \n\nobserved on a seismic section whereby a consistent pulse shape, which is the seismic \n\narrival of a reflection, can be recognized on successive traces with, perhaps, small \n\nchanges in arrival time from trace to trace (Jenyon and Fitch, 1985).  The length of the \n\ncontinuity represents the \u201carea of confidence\u201d from which the interpretation work can be \n\ncarried out; this may be interrupted and affected by poor data in which the continuity \n\ncannot be traced. Seismic continuity of a reflection is not an expression of the continuity of \n\na geological unit; rather it is an expression of the continuity of two geological units, one \n\nimmediately above the other (boundary or interface), and requires that both formations are \n\ncontinuous. The human eye is able to follow continuity on traces whose signal-to-noise \n\nratio is considerably less than 1:1 (Figure V.1), and the limits of confident interpretation \n\nare set by the signal-to-noise ratio (Jenyon and Fitch, 1985). \n\n \n\nFigure V.1 \u2013 Seismic continuity: a) good continuity; b) poor continuity; c) doubtful continuinity (in \n\nJenyon and Fitch, 1985). \n\n \n\nCorrelation (Figure V.2.) is defined as a purely pattern recognition which can be a single \n\npulse, distinguished by its length, amplitude or shape, observed in consecutive traces. \n\nCorrelation is used by the interpreter primarily to relate one \u201carea of confidence\u201d to \n\n\n\nChapter V. Seismic Data Interpretation of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n149 \n \n\nanother. The criteria to establish correlation are quite varied, and may vary with the nature \n\nof the correlation desired. There are three main types of correlation, which correspond to \n\nthe three definitions of stratigraphic level: time-stratigraphic correlation, bio-stratigraphic \n\ncorrelation, and litostratigraphic correlation (Jenyon and Fitch, 1985). Seismic correlation \n\ndepends on two features of the reflections: the shapes of the individual pulses which \n\nmake up the sequence of reflections; and the sequence of the reflections and their \n\nspacing (Jenyon and Fitch, 1985).  \n\n \n\nFigure V.2 \u2013 Seismic correlation; location (b) is 1mile from location (a) and location (c) is 10 miles \nfrom location (a). The correlation of the seismic events 1 to 5 between a and b is relatively easy; \nbut from (b) to (c) is not so simple (in Jenyon and Fitch, 1985). \n\n \n\nSelecting a Seismic Horizon \n\nThe primary purpose of most seismic surveys is to determine geological structures. This is \n\naccomplished by tracing identifiable seismic horizons on seismic sections. Where \n\ncontinuity can be recognized, it is picked, using either a pencil (when working on paper) \n\non using a drawing tool (when using interpretation software). Where continuity fails, a gap \n\nis left, and the picking is resumed when the tests of correlation permit the recognition of \n\nthe same horizons at another location (Mitchum and Vail, 1977). In this picking process, \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n150 \n \n\neither peak or trough of the seismic trace can be selected; also, either a manual, semi-\n\nmanual or automatic tool can be used (in the case of digital interpretation). \n\n \n\nGeological Unconformities  \n\nIn the pursuit of continuity or correlation of a seismic reflector, sometimes a split on a \n\nreflection is identified (non-continuous reflectors). Looking in the reverse direction, the \n\nseismic interpreter will find a reflection which is terminated, and cannot be traced further. \n\nThis is a troublesome phenomenon, because it is one which may have geological \n\nsignificance \u2013 or it may not. Toplap or onlap relationships among other reflection \n\nterminations could be recognized (Figure V.3) as the origin of non-continuous reflectors \n\n(Mitchum and Vail, 1977; Mitchum et al., 1977b; Jenyon and Fitch, 1985). Other types of \n\nreflector terminations are depicted in Figure V.4. \n\n \n\nFigure V.3 \u2013 Diagram of the geological relationships at toplap and onlap types of unconformities. \n\n \n\nInterpretation decisions are much less difficult after two reflections converge to yield a \n\nsingle reflection alignment. For this reason it is a good plan to select mapping horizons in \n\nthe deepest part of a basin, after a quick review of the whole area to establish that the \n\nchosen reflections have a wide development (Mitchum et al., 1977b; Jenyon and Fitch, \n\n1985). Where decisions are taken at a \u201csplit\u201d, it is imperative that consistent decisions are \n\nmade at every other point where that split appears in the seismic section, or in other \n\nprofiles from the same survey. In other words, if a sequence A terminates against \n\nsequence B, and sequence B continuous, at any other locations where there are doubts \n\nabout the continuation of A and B, A most be the one who terminates. \n\n\n\nChapter V. Seismic Data Interpretation of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n151 \n \n\nSummary of the differences between geological and seismic sections. \n\nSeismic sections are generally plotted in time, while the real Earth is in depth. The time-\n\nseries is plotted vertically below the observation point. However, the reflection point will, \n\ngenerally, not lie vertically below the observation point. \n\nThe seismic section also contains elements which do not have a direct relationship to the \n\nunderlying reflecting geological horizons: noise; multiple reflections arrivals; alignments or \n\nnoisy waves, etc. (Jenyon and Fitch, 1985). \n\n \n\nV. 2 Seismic Stratigraphy \n\nSeismic stratigraphy in very general terms, aims at identifying stratigraphic sequences \n\nand events on the seismic data. It generally deals with seismic data at three different \n\nlevels (e.g. Mitchum et al., 1977b; Jenyon and Fitch, 1985). The first level, usually termed \n\n\u201csequence analysis\u201d, attempts to divide the seismic section into a series of major \n\ndepositional units \u2013 depositional sequences\n5\n \u2013 separated by time hiatuses which are \n\nnormally important unconformities of regional significance. By considering the occurrence \n\nof \u201ctransgressive\u201d and \u201cregressive\u201d units within the sequences, and by tracing the \n\nunconformities laterally to their correlative conformities, it is sought to establish an \n\nabsolute geological time-frame work for the study area that can be regional \u2013 or even at \n\nworldwide level \u2013 by correlating these unconformities with changes in sea level throughout \n\ngeological time. At the second level, the techniques of \u201cfacies analysis\u201d examine the \n\npattern of seismic events within a sequence, with the objective of defining depositional \n\nenvironments and facies developments, the evolution of which, in total, makes up the \n\nsequence. At the third level, the individual seismic event is subjected to scrutiny, to \n\ndetermine the geological significance of lateral changes in its shape along the section (in \n\nits various forms almost invariably requires special reprocessing of the data) (e.g. Sloss \n\nand Moritz, 1950; Mitchum et al., 1977b,a; Vail and Mitchum, 1977; Jenyon and Fitch, \n\n1985). \n\nHowever, it shoud not be imagined that the methodical application of these three groups \n\nof techniques falls within the everyday experience of the interpreter. Rather, he should be \n\naware of the first two groups as an ordered approach to the seismic section and of the \n\npossibilities of the third group when a specific problem is to be addressed (Jenyon and \n\nFitch, 1985). \n\n                                                \n5\n  A Depositional Sequence is a  stratigraphic unit composed of relatively conformable sucessions \n\nof genetically strata and bounded at its top and base by unconformities or their correlative \nconformities (Vail and Mitchum, 1977). \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n152 \n \n\nV.2.1 Fundamentals of Seismic Sequence Stratigraphy \n\nOn a seismic profile, the parts that are missing, due to non-deposition or erosion \n\nprocesses, are sometimes more significant from the point of view of the passage of \n\ngeological time, than the parts which are indeed present. Some major hiatuses, \n\nrepresented by surfaces of unconformities, are surely linked to important geological \n\nevents \u2013 to marine transgressions and regressions, to long periods of sub-aerial or \n\nshallow marine erosion, or to periods of sustained sedimentation (Jenyon and Fitch, 1985; \n\nMitchum et al., 1977a; Vail et al., 1977). \u201cNon-sequences\u201d or disconformities due to \n\nsediment starvation, redistribution due to changes from low to high energy environments, \n\nor shifts in marine paleocurrents (and winds in the case of terrigenous deposits), \n\nfrequently leave the stratigraphic column as a very imperfect record of total sedimentation \n\nallowing the interpreter to delineate expected geological times. (Mitchum et al., 1977a; \n\nVail and Mitchum, 1977);  \n\nA great care is needed in seismic sequence stratigraphy. The seismic data alone are \n\ninsufficient for decisive conclusions to be drawn, and all available geological input to the \n\nsequence model must be included in the final analysis (e.g. wells). \n\n \n\nSeismic sequences and unconformities  \n\nThe two most important aspects of sequence analysis are (i) the separation of major \n\ndepositional units (sequence) in the section by recognizing their bounding unconformities \n\n(or conformities which are correlateable to unconformities in an adjacent area), and (ii) the \n\nrecognition of the pattern of sedimentation above the unconformity surface from the \n\nseismic response such that relative vertical changes (eustatic changes) in sea level can \n\nbe recognized and measured (Vail et al., 1977) \n\nThe relationships of reflections configurations at bounding unconformities are in a number \n\nof different ways depending upon the attitude of the underlying series, the existence of \n\nany erosional or diastrophic effects, or the configuration of internal structure (Figure V.4). \n\nThe termination of reflections at an unconformity surface is the principal evidence of the \n\npresence of a sequence boundary, and terminology has been developed to describe the \n\nvarious relationships seen, depending upon wether the events are terminating at an \n\noverlying or underlying unconformity surface (Vail and Mitchum, 1977), as shown in \n\nFigure V.4. The most commonly used are truncation and toplap, where sediments \n\nstarvation rather than very marked erosion has produced the unconformity and the \n\nunderlying terminations. In areas where well data is available, it may be possible, after \n\n\n\nChapter V. Seismic Data Interpretation of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n153 \n \n\ncareful analysis, to date the major sequence boundaries with reasonable certainty, and \n\nassign provisional ages to the other boundaries. \n\n \n\nFigure V.4 \u2013 Relationships of reflection configurations at bounding unconformities, and within a \nsequence (Mitchum et al., 1977). \n\n \n\nSea level fluctuations and depositional patterns \n\nAn unconformity, apart from representing a time hiatus, also provides a depositional \n\nsurface upon which sedimentation of the overlying sequence takes place. It has been \n\nnoted at many locations, that throughout geological time, there is evidence from \n\nobservation of varying lithologies and palaentology that apparent cyclic fluctuations of sea \n\nlevel have occurred (Vail and Mitchum, 1977; Vail et al., 1977). It is obviously highly \n\ndesirable to establish a correlation with seismic data and filed geology, since it would give \n\nan immediate and independent means of determining the geological age of a depositional \n\nsequence anywhere on Earth (Vail and Mitchum, 1977; Vail et al., 1977).  \n\nSeveral different approaches to this problem have been taken, and embodied in the \n\ntechniques of seismic sequence stratigraphy. The methods first suggested by Vail and \n\nMitchum (1977) and other researchers from the Exxon group are the basis for sucvh an \n\napproach (for further detail see Vail et al., 1977 and Jenyon and Fitch, 1985). \n\nThe general proposed procedure is summarized in Figure V.5. Sequence boundaries and \n\nthe traces of chronostratigraphic surfaces are marked on the seismic section (a), and from \n\nthem a chronostratigraphic chart is constructed (b), which indicates the spatial and \n\ntemporal extent of the various sequences present, and also highlights any erosional or \n\nnon-depositional hiatuses. From this information, using the estimates of coastal \n\naggradation and/or coastal encroachment measured from the seismic section, a regional \n\nchart of relative sea level changes is produced (c) (Vail et al., 1977). However, as said \n\nbefore, some modifications have been made to this procedure since then (e.g. Brown and \n\nFischer, 1979; Hallam, 1981; Van Hinte, 1982; Donovan and Jones, 1979). \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n154 \n \n\n \n\nFigure V.5 \u2013 Basic procedure for constructing regional charts of cycles of relative changes of sea \n\nlevel (Vail et al., 1977). \n\n \n\nV.2.2 Facies Analysis. \n\nIn sequence analysis, the establishment of a basic time/space framework of the major \n\ndepositional intervals separated by non-depositional or erosional intervals is the primary \n\napproach. This determination of the seismic response and the recognition on the seismic \n\nsection of different types of depositional facie s is obviously of greatest importance in \n\nhydrocarbon exploration. The main classes of characteristics in the seismic data utilized in \n\nfacies analysis can be summarized in three cathegories: (i) those at the boundaries of \n\nsequences; (ii) those within the sequences, and (iii) those defining the overall external \n\nshape of the facies unit (Mitchum et al., 1977b). \n\n \n\nSeismic characteristics at unconformities \n\nIn the case of a suprajacent unconformity, two main types of terminations can be \n\ndistinguished: erosional truncation or toplap (Figure V.4). Erosional truncation in its \n\nsimplest form is probably the most easily recognized. The actual erosion surface itself \n\nmay or may not produce a recognizable event and the unconformity is more or less well \n\ndefined by the truncated reflections below. Toplap may sometimes not be easily \n\ndistinguished from truncation. It is produced rather by non-deposition or sediment \n\n\n\nChapter V. Seismic Data Interpretation of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n155 \n \n\nstarvation, with perhaps minor erosion. Usually the terminations reflections show only low \n\nangularity or even parallelism with the overlying unconformity (Jenyon and Fitch, 1985). \n\nIn the case of the subjacent unconformity, the terminations reflections are defined as \n\nonlap or downlap (Figures V.3 and V.4). Onlap occurs where bedding reflections \n\nprogressively overlap a dipping unconformity surface; they are often horizontal or dip \n\nmore generally in the same sense as the unconformity. On a downlap, the reflections \n\nidentified are usually more inclined, and terminate the underlying unconformity surface \n\n(Mitchum et al., 1977b; Jenyon and Fitch, 1985; Figure V.4). \n\n \n\nTypes of Reflection Configuration Patterns  \n\nThe characteristics of the reflections within the seismic events may be classified in terms \n\nof their continuity, attitude within the unit, amplitude, frequency, and internal velocity, \n\nwhich are related to geological elements within the lithological facies such as continuity, \n\nstrata spacing/thickness, lithology, porosity, fluid content, erosional effects, and the \n\npresence of any gas/liquid contacts (Jenyon and Fitch, 1985). An adequate analysis of the \n\ninternal configuration of a facies unit and its external form, as well as its relationship to \n\nother units, can lead to an understanding of the overall depositional and \n\npaleophysiographic environment involved, and allows the possibility of prediction of the \n\nlithologies present. \n\nThe classification of internal reflection configurations is performed mainly based on the \n\nterminology developed by Mitchum et al. (1977c), which includes, among other \n\nclassifications: parallel, subparallel, divergent, sigmoid, oblique, chaotic, and reflection-\n\nfree configurations (Figure V.6). Several qualifying adjectives such as wavy, uniform, \n\ncontorted, disrupted, are commonly applied to the above terms to describe minor changes \n\nof the reflections features (Figure V.6). \n\n \n\nFigure V.6 \u2013 Seismic reflections configurations and patterns (modified from Mitchum et al., 1977c). \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n156 \n \n\nExternal form of Seismic Units or Facies \n\nAn understanding of the three dimensional external form of seismic facies is an important \n\nstep in their anaylises. The relationship of reflections to bounding unconformities, the \n\ndegree of continuity of the amplitude, could be an evidence of the environmental energy of \n\ndeposition (Sangree and Widmier, 1977). Sheet, wedge; bank and mound forms facies \n\nare commonly detected on seismic profiles (Mitchum et al., 1977b). Other facies are the \n\nfill facies which gives further information about the energy of the depositional system \n\n(Figure V.7). \n\n \n\nFigure V.7 \u2013 Some external form and fill facies of seismic facies units (modified from Mitchum et \nal., 1977c). \n\n \n\nV. 3 Seismic Interpretation of the data from the Gran Burato area \n\nIn order to create a reliable geological and seismo-stratigraphic interpretation, the \n\navailable 2D seismic reflection data from the Gran Burato area, together with its corrected \n\nnavigation, was imported into a seismic database using the seismic interpretation \n\npackage, Kingdom Suite (KS). Based on the seismo-stratigraphy defined for this region by \n\nMurillas et al. (1990) and Ercilla et al (2008), the main and regional discontinuities, which \n\nrepresent the boundaries between the defined seismic units (see Chapter II \u2013 Section II.4) \n\nwere interpreted. Faults within the study area were interpreted in each seismic section \n\nindividually and the main faults that affect the Gran Burato structure were spatially \n\nmapped and correlated wherever possible. \n\nJust after the cruise, a preliminary interpretation of the main seismic horizons was carried \n\nout and spatially correlated from section to section by the University of Aveiro team in \n\nwhich the author participated (Pinheiro et al., 2010). However and mainly due to the fact \n\nthat only a preliminary onboard seismic processing was available then, the deeper \n\n\n\nChapter V. Seismic Data Interpretation of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n157 \n \n\nhorizons could not be fully interpreted. Although, some faults had also been picked, a full \n\ninterpretation and the spatial correlation of these events were not carried out at that stage. \n\nIn the scope of this thesis the seismic interpretation was revised and improved with a \n\nmore detailed work, in particular in what concerns the deeper seismic units. Then, the \n\nmain faults were spatially correlated and time and depth horizon and structural maps were \n\nproduced for the top of the main interpreted seismic stratigraphic units.  \n\n \n\nV.3.1 The Kingdom Suite Software \n\nThe Kingdom Suite interpretation software package, developed by Seismic Micro-\n\nTechnology Inc., enables intuitive, integrated geoscientific workflow spanning, with several \n\navailable modules: \n\ni. 2d/3dPak - allows to interpret 2D and 3D seismic data, map and grid surfaces, and \n\ninclude well control; \n\nii.

Several other modules as Rock Solid Attributes (RSA); AVOPAK; SynPAK; \n\nModPAK; VelPAK. \n\n \n\nThe main desktop window of the Kingdom Suite can be divided into 4 different working \n\nareas: a project tree with all the project contents (e.g. faults, horizons, seismic lines, wells) \n\na 2D window to display vertical seismic sections; and a base map with the location of the \n\nstudy area where all the features can be displayed. There is also the possibility to work \n\nwith a 3D window that can be opened to help in the integrated visualization of the \n\ninterpretation work (Figure V.8). \n\nhttp://www.seismicmicro.com/\nhttp://www.seismicmicro.com/\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n158 \n \n\n \n\nFigure V.8 \u2013 GranBurato Kingdom Project. Project tree with items (horizons; faults, etc), 3D and \n\n2D views, and basemap. \n\n \n\nV.3.1 Importing Seismic Data \n\nDuring the acquisition cruise, all the processed seismic lines (in SEG-Y format) were \n\nimported into a Kingdom Suite (KS) project (Figure V.8), to check for inconsistent \n\nnavigation among crossing seismic lines. After this quality control, the navigation for each \n\nseismic profile was fixed ensuring its exact location of it. With all the navigation issues \n\nsolved, a crossover analysis of the sea-bottom reflection was performed to identify and \n\ncorrect existent local vertical miss-ties. \n\nAfter re-processing the seismic sections which had lower imaging quality (see Chapter III), \n\nthe new processed files were uploaded into the GranBurato Kingdom Suite project, \n\nreplacing the preliminary processed seismic lines. \n\n \n\nV.3.2 Seismic-Stratigraphic Horizons \n\nThe seismic interpretation was carried out taking into account the seismic-stratigraphic \n\nframework published in the literature (e.g. Murillas et al. (1990); see Chapter II - Section \n\nII.4). The interpreted seismic horizons were selected according to their regional \n\ncharacteristics and configurations, and correspond to discontinuities within the \n\nsedimentary record that may represent both erosion and lack of deposition periods. A total \n\n\n\nChapter V. Seismic Data Interpretation of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n159 \n \n\nof 7 seismic horizons, including the seabottom, were interpreted in each seismic section \n\nand spatially correlated, down to a depth of 2-3 seconds (TWT) below the seafloor. \n\nThe seismic horizon interpretation was performed mainly recurring to the manual picking \n\ntool of the Kingdom Suite; in some particular cases, where the continuity of the reflector \n\nwas high, the Auto2D Fill option was also used. After the interpretation, all the horizons \n\nwere interpolated to create regional surfaces using the FlexGridding Method with a cell \n\nsize of 200m x 200m. This horizons grid can be viewed in both 2D or 3D windows. \n\n \n\nV.3.2.1 Seabottom \n\nThe seabottom was interpreted in all seismic sections using the 2D Auto-Fill tool of the \n\nKingdom Suite package, which produced excellent results. \n\nThe seabottom reveals several negative structures ranging in size from meters to \n\nkilometers. The biggest depression corresponds to the investigated structure denominated \n\nthe Gran Burato, which is clearly visible and identified on the acquired seismic lines \n\n(Figure V.9). Other smaller seafloor depressions are also visible and were interpreted; \n\nsome of them near the Gran Burato area and other farther away (Figure V.9; see also \n\nV.3.4 Figure V. 45 and Figure V. 46). These small depressive structures are also probably \n\npockmarks related to gas seepage. \n\n \n\nFigure V.9 \u2013 Seismic Lines GB07 that crosses the Gran Burato pockmark depression. The inset \nshows other small-scale seafloor depressions filled with sediments, also probably related to gas \nseepage, and interpreted as buried pockmarks (vertical scale in sec \u2013 TWT). \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n160 \n \n\nThe interpretation grid of this horizon results in a pseudo-bathymetry of the study area. 2D \n\nand 3D displays (Figure V.10) allow the identification and delineation of the main and \n\nlarger-scale negative structures. The seabottom physiography is gentle, and ranges \n\nbetween 2.1s and 3.0s (TWT), i.e around 1500 and 2250m, in most part of the study area \n\n(Figure V.10). It is deeper in the Easthern part, reaching 3.7s (TWT), i.e 2770m; near the \n\nseismic line GB-40 where a large depression can be observed which may indicate the \n\npresence of an important fault (see Figure V.37). \n\n \n(a) (b) \n\n \nFigure V.10 \u2013 Seabottom grid displayed in a (a) 2D map and in a (b) 3D view. \n\n \n\nV.3.2.2 Seismic Unit 1 (Seabottom \u2013 H1) \n\nSeismic Unit 1 is easily identified in all the study area due to its high lateral continuity, \n\nwhich allows an easy spatial correlation from line to line. The thickness of this \n\nsedimentary layer is about 0.7s - 0.8s (TWT) (180m to 600m; see Figure V. 30). However, \n\nin the central part of the study area, near the Gran Burato structure, it has a thickness of \n\nless than 0.2s (TWT). This seismic unit, based on the interpretation carried out in the \n\nscope of the GRAN-BURATO 2010 project and this thesis, can be divided in three sub-\n\nunits: 1A, 1B and 1C, separated from each other by strong continuous reflections (Figure \n\nV.11). \n\nThe sub-unit 1A (Figure V.11) is characterized by high lateral continuity, and strong \n\nreflections with high amplitude values. This sub-unit has parallel stratified facies and is \n\nhighly affected by faults throughout its length. The thickness of this sub-unit is more or \n\nless constant in all the study area, around 0.4s (TWT). However, in the Gran Burato zone, \n\nthis sub-unit is thinner or is even absent, maybe due to erosion induced by ocean currents \n\nor by gas seepage. Sub-Unit 1B (Figure V.11) has an average thickness of 0.2-0.3s \n\n\n\nChapter V. Seismic Data Interpretation of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n161 \n \n\n(TWT) in the most part of the study area, and is also affected by faults. This sub-unit has a \n\nhigh lateral continuity but with low amplitude. The sub-unit 1C (Figure V.11) has a variable \n\nthickness up to 0.12s (TWT) and it is characterized by strong amplitude reflections with \n\nhigh lateral continuity. \n\n \n\nFigure V.11 \u2013 Seismic line GB-04 with interpreted seismic horizons H1 (blue line). The inset shows \n\nthe subunits identified within the Seismic Unit 1 (vertical scale in sec \u2013 TWT). \n\n \n\nWithin the Gran Burato area, the SU-1 is characterized by chaotic facies associated with \n\ncut-and-fill features, and deformed deposits close to the Gran Burato area. This unit \n\nshows a contorted aspect due to faulting and folding probably related to the Cenozoic \n\ntectonism. \n\nThe seismic horizon H1 (Figure V.13) corresponds to the base of this unit which is topped \n\nby the seafloor (Figure V.10). This seismic unit corresponds to the Seismic Unit 1 already \n\ndescribed by Murillas et al. (1990) and Ercilla et al. (2007), composed of turbidites and \n\nhemipelagites/pelagite of Late Eaocene to recent ages. \n\n \n\nV.3.2.3 Seismic Unit 2 (H1-H2) \n\nThe Seismic Unit 2 (SU-2) is separated from Seismic Unit 1 by a high continuity, strong \n\nhigh amplitude reflection (blue line in Figure V.11 and in Figure V.12). The thickness of \n\nSU-2 ranges from 0.2s to 0.4s (TWT) (60m to 380m; see Figure V. 30) in all the study \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n162 \n \n\narea. Similar to SU-1, it is highly affected by many major and minor faults. This seismic \n\nunit is characterized by stratified continuous and discontinuous reflections with high \n\namplitude. It shows a semi-transparent to transparent seismic texture in the deepest \n\nparte. On the Gran Burato flanks, this unit shows a parallel to subparallel configuration \n\n(Figure V.12).  \n\n \n\nFigure V.12 \u2013 Seismic line GB 32 with interpreted seismic horizons H1 (blue line) and H2 (yellow \nline) that represent the top and base of the seismic unit SU-2, respectively. The inset shows it \nseismic character and faulting (vertical scale in seconds \u2013 TWT). \n\n \n\nBelow the Gran Burato, SU-2 is characterized by chaotic facies and deformed sediments, \n\nprobably due to the compression and intense faulting that affects this region. This unit \n\nseems to drape on the old topography, revealing no evidence of important tectonic activity \n\nduring its deposition. \n\nSU-2 corresponds to the claystones, marls rich in nanno-fossils and pelagites of Seismic \n\nUnit 2 described in previous works (Murillas et al. 1990, Ercilla et al., 2007), which \n\nestimate its deposition took place from the Senoniam to Middle Eocene. \n\nThe Seismic Unit 2 is topped by the seismic horizon H1 (Figure V.13) and limited at its \n\nbase by the seismic horizon H2 (Figure V.16). The seismic horizon H1 lies at depths \n\nbetween 2.5s and 4s (TWT) below the water surface (Figure V.13). A depression is also \n\nobserved on the NE corner of the study area (Figure V.13), probably supporting the \n\nhypothesis of existence of a fault. In the Gran Burato area and to the SE, the depth of the \n\n\n\nChapter V. Seismic Data Interpretation of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n163 \n \n\nH1 is shallower. Figure V.13 is shows the top of the Seismic Unit 2 in a 2D grid and in a \n\n3D view.  \n\nFigure V.13 \u2013 H1 (top of the SU-2) grid displayed in a (a) 2D map and in a (b) 3D view. \n\n \n\nV.3.2.4 Seismic Unit 3 (H2-H3) \n\nThe Seismic Unit 3 (SU-3) is observed across all the study area, with exception of some \n\nareas below the Gran Burato, where its presence is uncertain. This seismic unit shows a \n\nvariable thickness (few to 0.45s in TWT) (up to 480m; see Figure V. 31) and, as already \n\nmentioned, an irregular distribution along the entire study area. It seems to be better \n\ndeveloped to the W of the Gran Burato, and its thickness decreases abruptly to the E of \n\nthis structure (Figure V.14).  \n\nSeismic Unit 3 is characterized by semi-transparent to continuous and parallel stratified \n\nfacies. Locally it may show strong-reflectors with short lateral continuity and high lateral \n\ncontinuity and also internal reflections with low amplitudes. Near the Gran Burato, this unit \n\nshows evidence of chaotic facies, probably associated with disturbed sediments that may \n\nrepresent cut-and-fill features and slumps. SU-3 is affected by major faults, and often \n\nshows its termination in form of pinch-outs (Figure V.15). This unit drapes and onlaps onto \n\nthe paleotopography and locally infills, indicating a deposition without significant \n\ntectonism. \n\nThis seismic unit is topped by the seismic horizon H2 (Figure V.16), which ranges in depth \n\nbetween 2.6s (TWT) and 4s (TWT). This seismic horizon follows the geometry of the \n\nprevious one and again the deepest area is observed on the NE corner.

It can be interpreted in all the extension of the study area. It is \n\ncharacterized by partially strong-reflections with short-lateral continuity, transparent facies, \n\nlow amplitudes reflections, and chaotic facies, particularly in the vicinity of the structural \n\nhigh below the Gran Burato and other similar structural acoustic basement highs. On the \n\nflanks of the main structural high of the study area it is possible to identify its termination \n\nas pinch-outs (Figure V.17). This unit infills the existent half-grabens and locally covers \n\nthe buried horst-and-graben structures of the acoustic basement. The infilling \n\nconfigurations can be classified as subparalell and divergent. Its thickness is variable to a \n\nmaximum of 0.45s (TWT) (up to 800m; see Figure V. 31 ), and is not observed in most \n\nareas below the Gran Burato (Figure V.17). SU-4 is topped by the seismic horizon H3 \n\n(Figure V.18), which was interpreted between 2.75s and 4.20s (TWT) below the sea \n\nsurface. The thichest values are observed in the Northern and Southern parts of the study \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n166 \n \n\narea. On the H3 grid surface, two structural highs are observed, like on the H2 time grid: \n\nthe first one in the Gran Burato area and the second to the South (Figure V.18). \n\n \n\nFigure V.17 \u2013 Seismic line GB-32 with the interpretation of the seismic horizons H1 (blue), H2 \n(yellow), H3 (green), and H4 (dark blue). The red box represents horizontal and subparalell \ndeposition which indicate post-rift sediments; the dotted red circle corresponds to a pinch-out; \nvertical scale in seconds (TWT). \n\n \n\nThis stratigraphic unit does not show significant evidence of relevant tectonic activity \n\nduring its deposition, since its seismic internal reflectors are mainly parallel to sub-parallel \n\nand seem to drape on the paleotopography. This seismic configuration indicates that SU-4 \n\nwas deposited in a post-rift environment infilling grabens and half-grabens (Figure V.17).  \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \n\nFigure V.18 \u2013 Top of the Seismic Unit 4 (seismic horizon H3) grid displayed in a (a) 2D map and in \n\na (b) 3D view. \n\n\n\nChapter V. Seismic Data Interpretation of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n167 \n \n\nThis unit corresponds to the Seismic Unit 4 described by Murillas et al. (1990) \n\n(Hauterivian to late Aptian in age) as a syn-and post-rift deposits of turbidite sandstones \n\nand siltstones with intercalations of clays and marls. However, in the interpretation \n\ndiscussed here, no evidences of syn-rift deposition were found. \n\n \n\nV.3.2.6 Seismic Unit 5 (H4-H5) \n\nThe Seismic Unit 5 (SU-5) is severely affected by deep faults, and is characterized by \n\nfault-rotated blocks (probably of the basement), associated with the rift episodes that \n\naffected this margin (Figure V.19; Figure V.20; Figure V.21). Sedimentary wedges with \n\nsub-parallel and divergent sedimentation patterns are clearly observed (Figure V.20; \n\nFigure V.21). The divergent configuration of the sedimentary wedges deposited on top of \n\nthe basement blocks, indicates that the faults were moving while SU-5 was being \n\ndeposited. Thus, SU-5 is classified here as a syn-rift unit (Figure V.20; Figure V.21). The \n\nthickness of this seismic unit ranges between 0.05s to 0.4s (TWT) (130m to 1000m; see \n\nFigure Figure V. 32). SU-5 corresponds to the Seismic Unit 5 (Murillas et al., 1990) \n\npresented above on the Chapter II, which has been classified as sandstones and \n\nclaystones of Valanginian age. Acoustically, SU-5 is characterized by variable amplitudes, \n\nwith some low frequency reflectors. It is classified as having a semi-transparent and \n\ndisrupted facies, as well as chaotic facies with local strong amplitudes, particularly near \n\nthe Gran Burato region (Figure V.19). \n\n \n\nFigure V.19 \u2013 Seismic line GB-24 with the interpretation of the seismic horizons H1 (blue), H2 \n(yellow), H3 (green), H4 (dark blue) and H5 (orange).

Seismic Unit 6 is \n\ndistinguished from SU-5 by a strong clear reflection that corresponds to the interpreted \n\nseismic horizon H5 (orange line in Figure V.23 and in Figure V.24). In Figure V.25 a 2D \n\ngrid map and a 3D view of this horizon is presented, showing that H5 lays between 2.9s \n\nand 4.9s (TWT).  \n\nWith the available dataset the base of the SU-6 unit could not be interpreted since it is not \n\nclearly imaged and that is why it is considered the acoustic basement. However some \n\nstrong reflections can still be observed above its top boundary (Figure V.23; Figure V.24). \n\nThese strong reflections could correspond to Seismic Unit 6, Seismic Unit 7 or to the \n\nbasement, according to the seismo-stratigraphy presented by Murillas et al. (1990). The \n\navailable dataset for the present work does not permit further details.  \n\nThis seismic unit may represent: (a) an Upper Jurassic sedimentary layer deposited \n\nduring an Oxfordian-Kimmeridgian extensional episode (Mauffret and Montadert, 1987); \n\n(b) a sedimentary sequences from the Lower and Middle Jurassic or even from the \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n170 \n \n\nTriassic; (c) Paleozoic sediments; (d) intrabasement features of a non-sedimentary origin, \n\nsuch as thrust faults or detachment faults (Murillas et al., 1990). \n\n \n\nFigure V.23 \u2013 Seismic line GB-01 with evidences of deeper and discontinuous reflections (yellow \narrows).

The conversion from time to depth for each horizon can be then \n\nperformed using the simple equation (Equation 9): \n\n \n\n    \n      \n \n\n \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\nwhere di is the depth of the horizon i, Vi is the seismic interval velocity characteristic of \n\neach formation (the interval velocity of the propagation of the p-waves), and ti is the time \n\n(in seconds, TWT) corresponding to the diference between the top horizon and the base \n\nhorizon of each seismic unit. \n\nThe velocity model adopted to compute the depth and thickness maps for each \n\ninterpreted seismic unit is composed of the velocities defined in Murillas et al., 1990, \n\nEq.9 \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n172 \n \n\ncombined with the stacking and migration velocities obtained during the seismic \n\nprocessing workflow. Due to the lack of other data, a layer-cake velocity model was built \n\nwith constant velocities for each layer (seismic-stratigraphic unit). Therefore, the velocity \n\nmodel considered for the time-to-depth conversion is composed of 6 layers: the water \n\ncolumn; SU-1, SU-2, SU-3, SU-4, and SU-5 (Figure V.26). To compute the seabottom \n\ndepth map a constant velocity of 1500m/s was used.  \n\n \n\nFigure V.26 \u2013 Layer cake velocity model adopted for the study area (vertical scale in seconds \u2013\n\nTWT). \n\n \n\nThe resulting 2D depth maps for the top of each seismic stratigraphic unit are presented in \n\nFigure V. 27 to Figure V. 29; depth values are referenced to the Mean Sea Level (MSL). \n\nTheir interpretation must be performed taking into account that, in the area of less density \n\nof seismic lines, the data interpolation process is less reliable, and the results should be \n\nanalysed with caution, in particular close to the edges of the study area. As expected, with \n\na time-to-depth conversion using a layer-cake velocity model with constant velocities, the \n\nmain shape of the observed features (structural highs and lows) are not highly affected \n\n(Figure V. 27; Figure V. 28; Figure V. 29). \n\nAs mentioned before for the horizon time grids, in particular for the seabottom, SU-1, SU-\n\n2, SU-3 and SU-4, and as expected for the depth maps, a depression is also observed in \n\nthe NE corner of the study area suggesting, the existence an important fault. Once again, \n\nthe low density of seismic lines at the edges of the study area influences negatively the \n\n\n\nChapter V.

Projection: UTM Zone 29N. \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n176 \n \n\nTo calculate the layer thicknesses, or the isopachs, for each stratigraphic unit, the depths \n\nof two consecutive seismic horizons were subtracted. The thickness of each seismic unit \n\nis presented in Figure V. 30; Figure V. 31; Figure V. 32. Thicknesses were only calculated \n\nin a smaller area, in which the available amount of data was acceptable. This calculation \n\nwas limited to the area of higher seismic data coverage (the area around the Gran Burato \n\nfeature) in order to have more accurate and reliable results. The evaluation of the \n\nthickness of each seismic unit allows us to identify where each stratigraphic unit is thicker \n\nor where it is thinner or absent, giving clues about the depositional environments of the \n\nstudy area.  \n\nSU-1 (Figure V. 30) has approximate thicknesses between 180m and 600m. The lower \n\nvalues are observed near the Gran Burato, and this unit gets thicker along its flanks, in \n\nparticular on the W side. The thickness of SU-2 (Figure V. 30) follows more or less the \n\nsame pattern as SU-1 and its thickness ranges from 60m to 380m. This seismic unit \n\nseems to be locally thicker to the W and E of the Gran Burato area, and then decreases \n\nagain. In both seismic units, their thicknesses decrease in the Gran Burato area (Figure V. \n\n30). SU-3 (Figure V. 31) has a very irregular thickness up to 480m across the entire study \n\narea. In the center of the study area this unit is not present. Westwards, the thickness of \n\nthe SU-3 seems to increase. This irregular distribution, and the inexistence of this unit on \n\nsome regions, is probably related to a strong erosion of this unit related with a tectonic \n\nuplift event. SU-4 (Figure V. 31) is one of the thickest stratigraphic units; it can reach the \n\n800m thick. However, these high values should be analyzed carefully because the seismic \n\nconstrains in these areas are low. Around the Gran Burato SU-4 is not observed or is very \n\nthin, maybe due to erosion (Figure V. 31). SU-5, characterized by syn-rift deposits, has an \n\nestimated thickness between 130m and close to 1000m. Higher values (as 1000m) are \n\nobtained at the edges of the limited area, mainly because of the lack of information to \n\nperform a reasonable data interpolation; therefore they maybe be looked at with caution. \n\nSU-5 appears to be thinner around the Gran Burato area and thickening to its flanks \n\n(Figure V. 31). \n\nIn summary, SU-1, SU-4 and SU-5 are the thickest stratigraphic sequences, reaching \n\nmaximum thicknesses of around 600m, 800 and 1000m, respectively. SU-2 and SU-3 \n\nshow lower and more variables thicknesses, which may indicate periods of strong erosion \n\nafter the deposition of these units. \n\n\n\nChapter V.

Twelve \n\ndifferent main faults could be spatially correlated (Figure V. 33; Figure V. 34; Figure V.35): \n\n? Fault-1 (F1) and Fault-2 (F2), one at each flank of an important structural high \n\n(probably a basement horst or less likely a diapiric structure) below the Gran \n\nBurato; \n\n? Fault-3 to Fault-5 (F3-F5), to the W of this structural high; \n\n? Fault-6 (F6), to the E of this structural high; \n\n? Fault-GB1 (F-GB1) and Fault-GB2 (F-GB2), located on the Gran Burato area; \n\n? Fault-7 to Fault-8 (F7 to F8), to the N of the Gran Burato. \n\n? Fault-9 to Fault-10 (F9 to F10), to the S of the Gran Burato. \n\n \n\nThe interpreted faults may be divided in three major families (Figure V. 33; Figure V. 34): \n\n(1)  NNW-SSE orientated faults \u2013 F1 to F6; \n\n(2)  WSW-ENE orientated faults \u2013 F-GB1 and F-GB2 \n\n(3)  WNW-ESE orientated faults \u2013 F7 to F10 \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n180 \n \n\nF1 is a W-dipping normal fault which affects the entire interpreted stratigraphic units. This \n\nfault represents the W border of what seems to be a tectonic horst located on the center \n\nof the study area, below the Gran Burato area. Its origin is probably related with the rift \n\nepisodes, since it affects the syn-rift sedimentary layers but may have suffered effects of \n\nthe Cenozoic compression. This fault is observed in the majority of the W-E direction \n\nseismic profiles across the Gran Burato area (GB-07/10A/13/14/31/32/33). It reaches \n\nclose to seafloor and extends with some confidence down to 2s (TWT). The larger \n\nextension of this fault probably indicates a reactivation of a major rift extensional fault \n\nduring the Cenozoic compression. The East border of this tectonic horst is controlled by \n\nfault F2, which has a similar orientation to F1. F2 is an E-dipping fault, probably \n\ncontemporaneous to F1, since it also affects all the stratigraphic sequence. This fault is \n\nalso observed in all the W-E seismic profiles acquired around the Gran Burato, and its \n\nexpression is the same as the F1 (it is observed close to the seafloor and can be followed \n\ndown to approximate 2s (TWT); Figure V. 33). \n\nTo the W of this horst, three main normal faults were interpreted - F3, F4 and F5 \u2013 which \n\nare parallel to the F1, and were probably originated at the same time, taking into account \n\nthat they also affect the syn-rift deposits. However these three faults only cut the \n\nstratigraphic sequences below Seismic Unit 3 (SU-2 and SU-1 appear not affected by this \n\nfault). The F3 and F4 faults are observed in all the W-E seismic profiles across the Gran \n\nBurato region (GB-01/04/07/10A/13/14/30/31/32/33), while fault F5 was only interpreted \n\non the seismic lines GB-14, GB-31, GB-32 and GB-33. All the three faults can be \n\nidentified between 0.6s-0.8s (TWT) reaching down to 2s (TWT) below the seafloor. These \n\nnormal faults control four half-graben structures clearly identified to the W of the main \n\ntectonic horst (Figure V. 33; Figure V.38). \n\nTo the East side of the tectonic horst only one fault (F7) was mapped. This is a normal \n\nfault and seems to affects only the syn-rift deposits; therefore its origin is probably related \n\nwith the rift episodes. F7 is also associated with the generation of half-graben structures. \n\nThis fault is parallel to F2 and is observed between 0.7s to 2s (in TWT) below the \n\nseafloor. Following the interpretation presented here, this fault appears to be inactive at \n\npresent, as it does not cut SU-1; its activity stopped somewhere after the main rift \n\nepisodes (Figure V. 33). \n\nTwo WSW-ENE orientated normal faults were also interpreted and spatially correlated \u2013 \n\nF-GB1 and F-GB2 (Figure V. 34). These two faults delimit the horst block located beneath \n\nthe Gran Burato and is probably related to its origin. F-GB1 and F-GB2 appear to control \n\n\n\nChapter V. Seismic Data Interpretation of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n181 \n \n\nthis tectonic horst on its S and N flanks, respectively, while the faults F1 and F2 delimit its \n\nW and E flanks, respectively. Both faults were observed in some S-N seismic profiles \n\n(GB-24/25/27), affecting all the seismic stratigraphic units. These faults are not as deep as \n\nthe previous ones, and can extend down to 1.5s (TWT) below the seafloor. These faults \n\ncould explain the uplift of a tilted block below the Gran Burato favoring the observed \n\nelevation on the W side of this feature (Figure V. 34). This elevated block was interpreted \n\nas a probable diapir by V\u00e1zquez et al. (2009) and Ercilla et al., 2011. Although this \n\ninterpretation cannot be completely rolled out, the interpretation preferred here is that it is \n\nmost likely a tectonic horst induced by the combined activity of the faults F-GB1 and F-\n\nGB2 (W-E), and F1 and F2 (N-S). Probably these faults were originated during the rifting \n\nepisodes, and were later reactivated during the Cenozoic compressional episodes, since \n\nas described previously they affect the entire sedimentary record. \n\nTwo WNW-ESE normal faults observed to the North of the ones described above were \n\nalso spatially correlated - F7 (S-dipping) and F8 (N-dipping); they delimit a NW-SE horst \n\nsimilar to the one described above (below the Gran Burato). They can be identified \n\nbetween 0.3s to 1.5s below the seafloor, and they are also probably related to the rift \n\nepisodes, since they appear to affect the syn-rift deposits. These faults do not affect the \n\nyoungest sedimentary layers (Figure V. 34). The combined activity of these two faults (F7 \n\nand F8) and F-GB1 and F-GB2 originated a graben between them, approximately 5km \n\nwide (Figure V.35; Figure V.36). \n\nTo the South of fault F-GB-2 two more WNW-ESE normal faults were mapped (F9 and \n\nF10). These faults appear to be contemporaneous to the rift episodes since they are \n\ncontrolling the tilted blocks. They are observed between the 0.6s and the 1.5s below the \n\nseafloor. F9 and F10 probably stopped the activity sometime at the end of the deposition \n\nof SU-3 or close to the start of the SU-2 deposition, since this last unit is not affected by \n\nthese two faults (Figure V. 34).  \n\nThe cartography of the main faults in the area with good seismic coverage allowed the \n\ncreation of structural maps for the entire study area (Figure V.35; Figure V.36). The Gran \n\nBurato surface depression seems to be surrounded and controlled by normal faults, which \n\nare probably related to its origin and evolution (Figure V.36). \n\nAll the spatially correlated faults seem to affect the deeper seismic stratigraphic units and \n\nthe syn-rift sediments. The faults which were described as not affecting the upper \n\nsedimentary units are probably older or at least their activity is not observed at present. \n\nWith the cartography of the main faults observed within the study area, two preliminary \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n182 \n \n\n \n\nFigure V. 33 \u2013 Seismic line GB-33 with the main NNW-SSE faults presented in color.

Seismic Data Interpretation of the BURATO4240 Survey \n\n185 \n \n\ncross-sections (W-E; and S-N) models were built.These cross-sections show the overall \n\nstructural style of the study area in  terms of faults, tilted blocks, and the deposition of the \n\nmain stratigraphic units (Figure V.38; Figure V.39). \n\nIn the NE part of the study area, there are evidences of an important fault, already \n\nmentioned above in section V.3.4. However, due to the lack of seismic coverage on this \n\narea this fault could not be mapped; it is possible to interpret it only on the seismic line \n\nGB-40 where it generates an important depression (Figure V.37). \n\n \n\nFigure V.37 \u2013 Seismic line GB-40, acquired in the Eastern part of the study area, where a big \n\ndepression probably induced by the activity of a normal fault is observed (see text above; on the \n\ninset, the probable location of the red fault is represented by a red line). The color lines correspond \n\nto the interpreted seismic horizons: H1 \u2013 blue; H2 \u2013 yellow; H3 \u2013 green; H4 \u2013 dark blue; H5 \u2013 \n\norange (vertical scale is in seconds - TWT). \n\n \n\nOn the remaining study area, several other major and minor faults were also identified and \n\ninterpreted as unassigned faults on each seismic section individually (see black line on \n\nthe seismic profiles presented above); however due to the lower density of seismic lines in \n\nthe areas farther away from the Gran Burato, at this stage, no reliable spatial correlation \n\ncould be performed. \n\nThe faults interpreted in the shallower areas of the seismic sections, affect mostly post-rift \n\nsedimentary units, especially SU-1, and are usually decoupled from the basement \n\nstructures. However, some of these faults can be interpreted as being related to the \n\nreactivation of the basement faults. These upper faults are considered to be neotectonic  \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n186 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure V.38 \u2013 Schematic cross-section for the study area striking W-E.

As concerning \n\nthe faults that affect the basement, it is possible, considering the present day strss field in \n\nthis region, that the WNW-ESE and WSW-ENE fault sets are now acting as strike-slip \n\nfaults; however, the available seismic lines do not allow to confirm this hypothesis. \n\n \n\nV.3.5 Seismic Expression of Gas Accumulations and Leakage \n\nOn the interpreted seismic lines, several possible evidences of fluid (most likely gas) \n\nmigration and possible accumulations may be identified. These evidences can be \n\ninterpreted both associated with the deeper stratigraphic units and with the shallower \n\nones. Some of the identified leakage events have seafloor expression (e.g. pockmarks), \n\nwhile others were detected by changes in the amplitude content of the seismic data. This \n\nleakage and accumulations indicators may be related to the presence of hydrocarbon \n\naccumulations in the depth of interest. In order to help this preliminary analysis, the \n\namplitude colorbar of the seismic display was modified so that it enhances the presence \n\nof amplitude anomalies. \n\nAs already mentioned above, several pockmarks (crater-like depressions at the seabed \n\nformed by the expulsion of gas and/or pore-water from the sediments; Figure V.40) on the \n\nseafloor were identified on almost all the seismic profiles (see Figure V.9 above). These \n\npockmarks are related to fluid seepage at the seabottom, which is probably migrating to \n\nthe surface through faults which cross several sedimentary layers (Figure V.40). \n\n \n\nFigure V.40 - Conceptual model for pockmark formation: (A) accumulation of gas beneath the \nseabed and the excess pore fluid pressure may inflate the sediments to form a seabed dome.; (B) \nrelease of the gas in a single event which lifts the sediments into the water column; (C) the fine \ngrained sediments are suspended in the water, and drift away by the currents (from Hovland and \nJudd, 1988). \n\n \n\nExamples of active and inactive pockmarks are found in many seismic lines from the \n\nstudy area (e.g. Figure V.41). Faults that cut Seismic Unit 1 seem to play an important \n\nrole in the migration and escape of the fluids from depth to shallower levels since they are \n\n\n\nChapter V. Seismic Data Interpretation of the BURATO4240 Survey  \n\n189 \n \n\nprobably acting as gas migration conduits (Figure V.42). Seismic signal attenuation as \n\nwell as high amplitude anomalies at the flanks of faults, or above, can indicate the \n\npresence of gas within the sediments. \n\n \n\nFigure V.41 \u2013 Seismic Line GB-24 shows high amplitude events pointed by the yellow arrows and \nby the red dotted circle (inset). In the inset high amplitude events, which may be related to \nhydrocarbon accumulations, are observed, as well as probable seafloor and buried pockmarks; the \nblack dotted line represents a fault which could be acting as migration path for fluid flow (red dotted \narrows) probably feeding the seafloor pockmark (vertical scale is seconds \u2013 TWT). \n\n \n\nFigure V.42 \u2013 Seismic Line GB-01 shows high amplitude events pointed by the yellow arrow and \nby the red dotted circles. On the inset two high amplitude events can be observed as well as some \npossible surface pockmarks at the seafloor; the black dotted lines represent some faults which may \nbe acting as migration paths for fluid flow (red dotted arrows indicate the fluid movement) (vertical \nscale is seconds \u2013 TWT). \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n190 \n \n\nIn seismic line GB-04, it is possible to identify a high-amplitude pinch-out as the \n\ntermination of Seismic Unit 3. This high amplitude content may be lithological dependent \n\nor on the other hand related with fluids accumulations at this stratigraphic level which is of \n\nparticular interest, since it is located on the flanks of a structural high (Figure V.43). In the \n\nsame seismic profile, closer to the seafloor, some high amplitudes events can also be \n\nidentified. These events are probably associated with seepage or shallow gas \n\naccumulations, or gas-related carbonates, and related with pockmarks at the seafloor \n\n(Figure V.43). This type of event is also observed on other close seismic lines, like GB-16 \n\nand GB-35. On the Northern part of GB-35 profile the SU-2 shows that it is possible to \n\nidentify an amplitude anomaly which can be related with pockmarks on the seafloor \n\nimmediately above it. In this section there are also evidences that fluids are migrating from \n\nthe SU-2 and reaching the seafloor, through faults that cut the sedimentary records until \n\nthe seafloor, originating pockmarks (see Figure V. 45). \n\n \n\nFigure V.43 \u2013 Seismic line GB-04, South of the Gran Burato, shows high amplitude pinch-outs \ncorresponding to SU-3. The two insets shows locations of interest: red box \u2013 high amplitudes \nlocated on a structural high and a amplitude anomaly that stops against a fault; yellow box \u2013 \nseafloor pockmarks maybe generated by the migration of gas (red arrows) through the faults (black \ndotted lines) (vertical scale is seconds \u2013 TWT). \n\n\n\nChapter V. Seismic Data Interpretation of the BURATO4240 Survey  \n\n191 \n \n\nIn the Eastern part of this seismic profile, a strong reflection, which seems to be \n\nconstrained between faults, is observed and may be related with fluid accumulation \n\n(Figure V.44). \n\n \n\nFigure V.44 \u2013 Seismic Line GB-01 shows high amplitude events response within SU-2 (pointed by \nthe red arrows and circles) and SU-3 (represented by green dotted circles) (vertical scale is \nseconds \u2013 TWT). \n\n \n\nIn the study area, several other very large negative structures, similar to the Gran Burato \n\ncan also be found. On the seismic line GB-35 (Figure V. 45), a very peculiar feature was \n\nidentified (Feature A with about 13km\n2\n). It is still unknown if it is related to gas seepage or \n\nnot, but it looks like a buried large pockmark similar to it. Some strong amplitude above it \n\nand faults which could be acting as gas paths, support this interpretation. Several \n\npockmarks are also identified on this same profile. In the center part of this section, strong \n\namplitudes on SU-2 are probably related to gas or fluids accumulation (Figure V. 45). The \n\npresence of seafloor pockmarks above this potential accumulation, where the fault density \n\nis higher, also supports this idea.  \n\nAnother similar structure to the Gran Burato is also found in the Southern part of the \n\nseismic line GB-36, in the Southern part of the study area (Feature B, with about \n\n28km\n2\n), which appears to be controlled by two faults (Figure V. 46). On the \n\nnorthern part of the section, SU-2 is represented by strong amplitudes. Across this \n\nseismic profile several seabed pockmarks can also be identified (Figure V. 46). \n\nNear the Gran Burato, several disrupted seismic events with high amplitude are also \n\nobserved (Figure V. 47). This could indicate that the much part of the gas which may be \n\naccumulated within this area, in the past, probably escaped during the formation of this \n\nlarge and singular structure. A preliminary hypothesis for the evolution of this structure \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n192 \n \n\nmay be related to the fast release of a huge amount of gas which was accumulated within \n\nthe sediments, on the flanks of structural high beneath the Gran Burato. \n\n \n\nFigure V. 45 \u2013 Seismic Line GB-35 shows several pockmarks at the seafloor probably generated \nby gas seepage coming from depth; a potential source are the high amplitudes in SU-3 (red dotted \ncircle). In the Southern part of the seismic profile, a depression similar to the Gran Burato can also \nbe observed (Feature A; vertical scale is seconds \u2013 TWT). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure V. 46 \u2013 Seismic Line GB-36 shows high amplitude events pointed by the red dotted circles. \nIn the Southern part of the seismic profile a depression similar to the Gran Burato is observed \n\n(Feature B) (vertical scale is seconds \u2013 TWT). \n\n \n\nThese seafloor depressions, Feature A and Feature B, are very similar to the Gran \n\nBurato, and so they can be described as very large pockmarks. The Gran Burato and the \n\nFeature A seem to be aligned with the NW-SE fracture trends observed in the study area \n\n(Figure V.48). \n\n\n\nChapter V.

No noticeable evidences of gas or fluids accumulations are observed; this could indicate \nthat the gas that accumulated in this area was already escaped during the formation of the Gran \nBurato (vertical scale is seconds \u2013 TWT). \n\n \n\nFigure V. 48 \u2013 Bathymetric map of the study area showing the location of the Gran Burato and of \nthe other two identified features (see explanation on the above text).

Druet of Instituto Espa\u00f1ol de Oceanograf\u00eda (IEO). The inset in \nthe top right corner shows the location of the study area, highlighted by the red box (bathymetry \ndata from GEBCO Digital Atlas). \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n194 \n \n\nAs previously discussed there are some possible evidences of gas accumulations. The \n\nfaults which affect the deeper units have probably acted as conduits for the fluid migration \n\n(most likely gas), from deeper to shallower levels. Within SU-2 and SU-3 several possible \n\nevidences of gas, represented by strong amplitudes anomalies, were observed. Thus, \n\nthese two seismic units are or particular interest since they might be responsible for the \n\npotential accumulation of hydrocarbons in this region. The high fault density observed in \n\ncertain areas above these units would facilitate the fluids migration through the \n\nsedimentary layers. \n\nIn summary, the 2D seismic sections shown in this section illustrate the structural and \n\nstratigraphic style of potential hydrocarbon accumulation sites. These potential \n\naccumulation sites are related with 3 and 4-way dip closure structures, associated with the \n\nstructural highs that can be found within the study area, and with the pinch-outs \n\nterminations of SU-2 and SU-3. The potential stratigraphic accumulations, the pinch-out, \n\nare mainly associated with SU-2 and SU-3, and in most cases are located in the flanks of \n\nimportant structural highs and have high amplitude content. For this reason, these two \n\nstratigraphic units are probably the most promissory, concerning potential hydrocarbons \n\naccumulation. \n\n \n\nV.3.6 Genesis of the Gran Burato \n\nThe formation of the Gran Burato is probably related to the Cenozoic compressive regime \n\nassociated with the accumulations of fluids (most probably gas) in the sedimentary \n\nsequence. The original extensional rift faults, some of which were probably reactivated \n\nduring the Cenozoic compression, probably acted as migration paths for the gas through \n\nthe sedimentary layers (Figure V.49). During the Cenozoic compression, the upper \n\nsedimentary layers in the study area were highly folded and fractured; in particular, the \n\nareas on top of structural highs were the most affected, and highly fractured zones were \n\ncreated at the fold axis (II in Figure V.49). In fact, the Gran Burato is located on top of a \n\nstructural high, probably a reactivated basement horst. The faults which control this \n\ntectonic horst had probably acted as active migration paths for the gas, which was being \n\naccumulated in these highly fractured zones, with the sediments becoming more and \n\nmore fluidized, increasing the fluids pressure in this zones which may inflate the \n\nsediments to form a seabed dome (III in Figure V.49). Due to the continue accumulations \n\nof gas in these fractured zones, the fluidification and remobilization of the sediments \n\noccur, and crater-like structures are then created (III in Figure V.49).  \n\n\n\nChapter V. Seismic Data Interpretation of the BURATO4240 Survey  \n\n195 \n \n\n \n\nFigure V.49 \u2013 Genetic and evolutionary model of the Gran Burato: I - rotated blocks, horst and half-graben \n\nstructures created during the main rifting phases, and post-rift parallel sedimentation without relevant tectonic \nmovement; II \u2013 the Cenozoic compression regime due to the Africa-Eurasia convergence have generated \nfractured sedimentary sequences and asymmetric folds; III \u2013 highly fractured zones created on top of \nstructural highs of the basement and at the fold axis; faults acting as migration paths for the gas (red coloured \nfaults; blue arrows), which is accumulated in these highly fractured zones fluidificating the sediments (green \ndotted box): a) pressure build up phase - fluids (most likely gas) migration through the faults and excess of \ngas accumulations beneath the seafloor with the possible formation of a seabed dome; b) and c) the \ngas/sediment expulsion phase \u2013 release of the gas which lifts the sediments into the water; the fine-grained \nsediments are suspended in the water and are drifted away by the currents; the influence of the gas hydrates \ndissociation may have been presented in these stages; d) a seafloor crater is created (model according to \nHovland and Judd, 1988); IV \u2013 large depressions are created in the seafloor, such as the Gran Burato. The \nseismic profiles represent the different stages presented in II, III and IV, which are observed in different \nlocations of the study area; vertical scale in seconds (TWT). \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n196 \n \n\nAs the gas migration still occurs, these crater zones will increase in size, becoming larger \n\nand deeper, while the fluidification and remobilization processes of the sediments are \n\ntaking place (III in Figure V.49). These sediments are lifted into the water column and \n\ndrifted away by the currents (III in Figure V.49). A large crater in the seafloor, such as the \n\nGran Burato, is then created (IV in Figure V.49). Therefore, the Gran Burato was probably \n\noriginated by several episodes of gas extrusion, which was being accumulated in the \n\nsedimentary sequences, causing the continous remobilization of the seafloor sediments. \n\nA question that needs to be addressed is the triggering mechanism for the origin of the \n\ngiant pockmarks observed in this area. Tectonics and faulting certainly had an important \n\nrole in gas migration and formation of conduits for the gas escape. However, gas hydrate \n\ndissociation could have been the triggering mechanism. At this depth and given the \n\npresence of gas in the sediments, the formation and existence of gas hydrates was almost \n\nsure. The dissociation of these gas hydrates induced by several factors (e.g. climate \n\nchanges, sudden pressure release by faulting, or others) would have strongly fluidized the \n\nsediments. Therefore, the presence and dissociation of gas hydrates may have been an \n\nimportant factor in the formation of these giant pockmarks, such as the Gran Burato. \n\nThe preliminary genetic and evolutionary model shown in Figure V.49 can explain the \n\npossible formation of this outstanding feature. However, more geological and geophysical \n\ndata are needed to confirm and detail this preliminary model proposed for the formation of \n\nthe Gran Burato. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n197 \n \n\nChapter VI. Conclusions \n \n\n \n\nA detailed seismic data processing is the best method to improve the resolution of the \n\nseismic sections, increasing substantially their quality. The application of suitable seismic \n\nprocessing flows in the scope of this work made possible the improvement of the \n\npreliminary processing of the 2D multichannel seismic lines acquired during the \n\nBURATO4240 cruise. The application of leading industry processing techniques such as \n\npre-stack time migration and bandwidth extension, allowed the improvement of the \n\nonboard seismic processing, and to obtain good quality final seismic sections. \n\nThe re-processing of the multichannel seismic lines was essential for the seismic \n\ninterpretation work, in particular for the interpretation of the faults and of the deeper \n\nseismic-stratigraphic units. The seismic-stratigraphic sequences described in the literature \n\nwere identified on the seismic sections studied and correlated across the study area. \n\nSeveral rotated blocks associated with listric faults related to the Atlantic rift episodes \n\nwere clearly observed on the seismic profiles, in particular on the W-E profiles. \n\nA satisfactory, but still preliminary, structural interpretation of the study area was obtained, \n\nwhich contributes to a better knowledge about the possible formation of the Gran Burato, \n\nand the underlying geology. The Gran Burato is located above a tectonic horst delimited \n\nby two major faults, which were reactivated during the Alpine orogeny. These and other \n\nfaults could be mapped and correlated across the study area. However, to increase the \n\ndetail of the presented structural map, higher density of seismic data is required to make \n\npossible the correlation in areas where this density is lower. \n\nThe origin of the Gran Burato seems to be related to major episodes of gas expulsion. \n\nThese episodes have lifted the overlying sediments into the water column which were \n\ndrifted away probably by bottom currents, creating this outstanding depression at the \n\nseafloor. This gas probably accumulated in the sediments at depth, created overpressure \n\nand migrated through the faults to the uppermost stratigraphic sequences and to the \n\nseafloor. The weaker evidence of the presence of gas or other fluids below and in the \n\nimmediate vicinity of the Gran Burato seems to support the idea that the majority of the \n\ngas in this area has already escaped, probably during the formation of this very large \n\npockmark. \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n198 \n \n\nTwo features similar to the Gran Burato are also observed to the South of it .These two \n\nseafloor depressions are also very large pockmarks and most likely have a similar origin \n\nto the Gran Burato. However, horizontal reflectors probably caused by pelagic \n\nsedimentation inside these two structures indicate its present day inactivity. Inside the \n\nGran Burato these horizontal reflections are not observed, which might be related to a \n\npresent-day activity or a recent activity of fluid or gas escape. A possible explanation is \n\nthe fault-control activity of these pockmark structures which were activated/originated from \n\nSouth to North, the Gran Burato being the most recent one; this would explaind why thus \n\nfeature is not yet filled with sediments. Alternatively, some gas escape could still be taking \n\nplace. \n\nA preliminary interpretation of possible evidences of gas or other fluids accumulations and \n\nleakage were performed is the scope of this work, and several amplitude anomalies were \n\nidentified. These amplitudes anomalies were mainly observed within the Seismic Unit 2 \n\nand Seismic Unit 3, and could be related to the presence of fluid or gas within the \n\nsediments, or to the lithologies or characteristics of these units. A detailed approach using \n\nseismic attributes to determine the possible gas or fluids accumulation, and to detect \n\npossible zones of hydrocarbon accumulation, is a future approach to perform on this \n\ndataset (a preliminary work on this subject was already perfomed by L. Azevedo at the \n\nUniversity of Aveiro). \n\nIn order to extend this research and to support some of the conclusions of this work, a \n\nnew seismic dataset needs to be acquired in the areas with lower density data coverage. \n\nIn fact, another scientific survey \u2013 the Gran Burato 2011 cruise \u2013 was just carried out in \n\nthis study area in August 2011, in the scope of the same research project, increasing the \n\nseismic data coverage in this area; the author also participated in this cruise. The \n\nprocessing and interpretation of this new 2D multichannel seismic dataset will provide \n\nessential information to support some of the conclusions already presented, to continue \n\nthis research work in this area, and also to extend this research to a larger area. \n\nFuture work on this subject should also include a detailed AVO processing stage, in order \n\nto further investigate the existence of gas, and the application of seismic attributes to \n\nstudy the variability and dimensions of these accumulations. The structural map already \n\npresented should be extended to a larger area to better understand which were the \n\nimportant events related to the origin of the Gran Burato and associated features. The \n\nnew dataset acquired in 2011, will certainly represent a solid base to support and to \n\ncontinue this investigation. \n\n\n\n  \n\n199 \n \n\nReferences -  \n \n \n\nAlves, T.

This will allow the selection of a desirable CMP range, in order to have the \n\nmaximum fold, and the maximum resolution. \n\nAs example, the seismic line GB-23 was selected, in which the CMP location ranges \n\nbetween 965 and 2435. The borders ones are rejected because they don\u2019t have the \n\nmaximum fold (maximum coverage). Therefore, the CMP locations between 1000-2400 \n\nwere chosen. The desired is to have CMP starting on 1000, incrementing of 50, until \n\n2400. \n\nThe first Trace Header Cell Math will subtract to each CMP location 975 and the result is \n\ndemonstrated in Figure A. 1. \n\n \n\na) b) \n\nFigure A. 1 - Trace Header Cell Math processing: a) Trace Header Cell Math number 1; b) \n\nsummary table explaining the math operation. \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n \n\n208 \n \n\nNext, with another Trace Header Cell Math, the value of CMP Locaton is divided by the \n\nshooting spacing, 50m (Figure A. 2). \n\n \n\na) b) \n\nFigure A. 2 - Trace Header Cell Math processing: a) Trace Header Cell Math number 2; b) \nsummary table explaining the math operation. \n\n \n\nThe next Trace Header Cell Math will select just the integer part of each CMP Location \n\n(Figure A. 3). \n\n \n\na) b) \n\nFigure A. 3 - Trace Header Cell Math processing: a) Trace Header Cell Math number 3; b) \nsummary table explaining the math operation. \n\n\n\nAppendix \u2013 SPW Calculations. \n\n \n\n209 \n \n\nAfter this, the next Trace Header Cell Math is applied to multiply every CMP Location by \n\nthe shooting spacing, 50m. Notice that now we have CMP Location starting with zeros \n\nand increasing by 50 (Figure A. 4). \n\n \n\na) b) \n\nFigure A. 4 - Trace Header Cell Math processing: a) Trace Header Cell Math number 4; b) \nsummary table explaining the math operation. \n\n \n\nThe last Trace Header Cell Math will perform the summing of the CMP Location, by the \n\nvalue of the first CMP Location desirable, 1000 (Figure A. 5). \n\n \n\na) b) \n\nFigure A. 5 - Trace Header Cell Math processing: a) Trace Header Cell Math number 5; b) \nsummary table explaining the math operation. \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n \n\n210 \n \n\nFinally, completing this processing sequence it is applied an Automatic Gain Control in \n\norder to increase the deeper amplitudes events (Figure A. 6). \n\n \n\nFigure A. 6 - Automatic Gain Control processing. \n\n \n\nThe final result is a CMP Location sequence starting in 1000, increasing by 50, and \n\nfinishing on 2400, and, more important, each new CMP Location is now a sum of old CMP \n\nlocation. The intended increase of the fold was accomplished. The total processing flow \n\nfor the SuperGathers computation is presented in Figure A. 7.  \n\n \n\nFigure A. 7 - SuperGathers processing flow. \n\n\n\nAppendix \u2013 SPW Calculations. \n\n \n\n211 \n \n\nA.II Offset-Ordered Seismic File \n\nIn order to compute an offset-ordered seismic file, a sequence of Trace Header Column \n\nMath and Trace Header Cell Math card was built. The objective of these headers \n\noperations was to have an offset gather at each CMP Position, in order to increase the \n\nresolution. This offset-ordered processing sequence is a requirement in the Radon \n\nDemultiple application. \n\nIn the beginning, a Trace Header Column Math card was used to copy the original offset \n\nvalues to another header field, to preserve the original offset data (Figure A. 8). The \n\nsecond operation is performed using a Trace Header Cell Math card, to convert the offset \n\nvalues to absolute values (Figure A. 9). \n\n \n\nFigure A. 8 \u2013 Trace Header Column Column Math processing (N\u00ba1) carried out during the Radon \nDemultiple processing flow. \n\n \nFigure A. 9 \u2013 Trace Header Cell Math processing (N\u00ba2) carried out during the Radon Demultiple \nprocessing flow. \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n \n\n212 \n \n\nThe next operation consists in the subtraction to the Offset a value, in order to get the \n\nOffset values increasing by the CMP spacing value. In other words, as the Source-\n\nReceiver Offset was 186.7m and the CMP spacing was 6.25m, a value of 180.45m is \n\nsubtracted to the offset for each CMP position (186.7m - 180.45m = 6.25m) (Figure A. 10).  \n\n \n\nFigure A. 10 \u2013 Trace Header Cell Math processing (N\u00ba3) carried out during the Radon Demultiple \nprocessing flow. \n\n \n\nThe next step, using another Trace Header Cell Math card is to divide the Offset header \n\nfield by the double of the shot interval (100m) (Figure A. 11). \n\n \n\nFigure A. 11 \u2013 Trace Header Cell Math processing (N\u00ba4) carried out during the Radon Demultiple \n\nprocessing flow. \n\n\n\nAppendix \u2013 SPW Calculations. \n\n \n\n213 \n \n\nOn the next operation, only the integer part is kept on the Header Field (Figure A. 12)  \n\n \n\nFigure A. 12 \u2013 Trace Header Cell Math processing (N\u00ba5) carried out during the Radon Demultiple \nprocessing flow. \n\n \n\nAfter this operation, we multiply the Offset by 100m (Figure A. 13), and then we sum the \n\nvalue of the real Source-Receiver Offset, 186.7m (Figure A. 14). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure A. 13 \u2013 Trace Header Cell Math processing (N\u00ba6) carried out during the Radon Demultiple \nprocessing flow. \n\n\n\nMultichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia \n\n \n\n214 \n \n\n \n\nFigure A. 14 \u2013 Trace Header Cell Math processing (N\u00ba7) carried out during the Radon Demultiple \nprocessing flow. \n\n \n\nWith this header field math sequence, we will have at least one offset gather in each CMP \n\nlocation. In the most of the cases, we will get the same CMP in 8 different locations. This \n\noffset modification is just temporally. After the Radon Demultiple processing the original \n\noffsets, previously stored in another header field, are loaded again (see Section IV.3.2 \u2013 \n\nFlow6). The last operation is the saving of the Offsets modification on another header field \n\n(Figure A. 15). \n\n \n\nFigure A. 15 \u2013 Trace Header Column Math processing (N\u00ba8) carried out during the Radon \nDemultiple processing flow. \n\n\n\t1_Capa_Thesis\n\t2_Contents\n\t3_ChapterI\n\t4_ChapterII\n\t5_ChapterIII\n\t6_ChapterIV\n\t7_ChapterV\n\t8_ChapterVI\n\t9_References\n\t10_Appendix"}]}}}
