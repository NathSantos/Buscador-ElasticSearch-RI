My willingness to curiously explore the best of human \n\nbehaviors across the world is the direct result of such a mix of international and \n\ninterdisciplinary studies. \n\nI am also thankful to Thibaut Cournarie from Kea &amp; Partners who helped me define the \n\nsubject, to Alison Caille (Airbus), Jeremy Pauliat (Decathlon), Beno\u00eet Ch\u00e9h\u00e8re \n\n(Michelin), S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Guitton (Imfusio), Alexandre Gerard (Inov\u2019on), and Elias \n\nBuchwald (Cycloid) who took the time to send me extensive details about their fantastic \n\nwork. \n\nWhen it comes to the ideas themselves, the book of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Laloux impacted me in a \n\npowerful way. On a personal basis, it led me to undertake a 10-day meditation retreat, \n\nmade me discover non-violent communication, and gave me strong new convictions \n\nabout leadership. It might seem trivial, but I am also grateful to him for allowing readers \n\nto pay \u201cwhat feels right\u201d for his book, I would not have accessed this significant book \n\notherwise. \n\nFinally, I would like to express all my gratitude to my family and friends for their \n\nsupport and interest. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n ABSTRACT \n\n \n\nThis study addresses the current debate about the existence of an organizational model \n\nin liberated companies, which impacts its generalization and its transmission over time. \n\nOur purpose is to determine whether there is any consistency across the various \n\norganizational patterns in liberated companies. To reach this goal, 114 liberated \n\norganizations and twenty-five of their primary organizational patterns were identified \n\nin the literature. Then, a survey was sent to these 114 organizations to see how \n\nconsistent these twenty-five patterns were across the universe. Data was collected from \n\nthirty-nine answers out of these 114 targeted companies. This data led to identifying \n\neleven features that were present in most of the thirty-nine liberated companies who \n\ncompleted the questionnaire. Ten other patterns were found in the majority of the \n\nsample, while four patterns were identified as scarce. It was also determined that larger \n\ncorporations operate differently. The analysis that was conducted will help leaders to \n\nunderstand the features of liberated companies. \n\nKeywords: Organizational structure, Organizational change, Self-management, \n\nDecision-making. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRESUMO \n\n \n\nEsta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o aborda o debate sobre a exist\u00eancia de um modelo organizacional em \n\nempresas inovadoras (\"liberated companies\"). O objetivo \u00e9 determinar se h\u00e1 qualquer \n\nconsist\u00eancia entre os v\u00e1rios padr\u00f5es organizacionais de empresas inovadoras. Para \n\nresponder essa quest\u00e3o, primeiro foi identificado na literatura 114 empresas inovadoras \n\n(liberated companies) e listado vinte e cinco caracter\u00edsticas organizacionais presentes \n\nnessas empresas. Foi enviada uma pesquisa para as 114 empresas identificadas, para \n\nverificar a consist\u00eancia (ou n\u00e3o) dos vinte e cinco caracter\u00edsticas organizacionais. \n\nForam coletados dados de 39 das 114 empresas. A an\u00e1lise dos resultados indicou que \n\nonze caracter\u00edsticas estavam presentes na maioria das 39 empresas que completaram o \n\nquestion\u00e1rio. Dez outros padr\u00f5es foram encontrados na maioria da amostra, enquanto \n\nquatro padr\u00f5es foram identificados como raros. Tamb\u00e9m foi identificado uma maneira \n\ndiferente de funcionamento para empresas maiores.

A liberated company is defined by Isaac Getz (2009) as \u201can organizational form \n\nthat allows employees complete freedom and responsibility to take actions they decide \n\nare best.\u201d The concept is far from being new: William L. McKnight, the CEO of 3M in \n\n1924, was already claiming that \u201cIf you put fences around people, you get sheep. Give \n\npeople the room they need\u201d (GETZ, 2009, p. 6). Likewise, in the 1950s\u2019 the American \n\ncompany WL Gore was already organized according to the principles of a liberated \n\ncompany. In France in the last ten years, the concept has been growing exponentially. \n\nThis topic was made the subject of multiple conferences, press articles, a televised \n\ndocumentary and even a comic book published in 2016. I. Getz said in a conversation \n\nwith Ricardo Semler, leader of the Brazilian liberated company Semco, that \u201cright now, \n\nin France and French-speaking countries, I personally know probably about 250 \n\ncompanies that we would call \u201cliberated corporations\u201d\u201d (SEMLER, 2017, podcast). On \n\nwhat basis has this movement developed itself? \n\nThis movement can be rather surprising since Geert Hofstede\u2019s research on cross-\n\ncultural management attributed to France a score on power distance of sixty-eight, \n\nwhich is higher than the world\u2019s average of fifty-seven. People in societies with a large \n\ndegree of power distance are indeed supposed to \u201caccept a hierarchical order in which \n\neverybody has a place and which needs no further justification\u201d (HOFSTEDE, 1984). \n\nIsaac Getz (2016) explains the spread of the liberated companies\u2019 movement by the \n\nexistence of an ecosystem supporting the development of liberated organizations in \n\nFrance and the willingness to overcome hierarchy precisely because it is strong. \n\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Zobrist, who \u201cliberated\u201d Favi in the 1980s\u2019, explains that the \n\nliberated companies model also provides \u201cwhat the youth is looking for: knowing why, \n\nand be free about the how\u201d. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Laloux, the author of the book Reinventing \n\nOrganizations, also believes that this organizational form fits the Millennials, the \n\ngeneration that \u201chas grown up in the disruptive world of the Internet, where people\u2019s \n\ninfluence is based on contribution and reputation, not position\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, p. \n\n139). \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGary Hamel adds that \u201cmanagers today face a new set of problems, products of a \n\nvolatile and unforgiving environment\u201d (HAMEL, 2009, online), which is often \n\ndesigned by the acronym VUCA (Volatility, Uncertainty, \n\nComplexity, and Ambiguity). This vastly more complex environment calls for a new \n\ngovernance in organizations that would be more \u201cadaptive, flexible, self-renewing, \n\nresilient, learning, and intelligent\u201d (WHEATLEY &amp; KELLNER-ROGERS, 1996, p. 1). \n\nThese three elements seem to explain the recent exponential development of \n\nliberated organizations. In the opinion of I. Getz (2017), this movement will eventually \n\nspread to other companies, since \u201cevery couple of days\u201d he hears \u201cabout a new company \n\nthat\u2019s become liberated\u201d. In his opinion, based on research on social movements, if \n\nseven percent of the 2000 companies of more than 500 employees in France become \n\nliberated, that is to say about 140 companies, \u201cthe whole French economy will collapse \n\ninto liberation.\u201d \n\nHowever, the question of how to reach this point is at the center of a debate in the \n\nliterature. I. Getz (2009) believes that there is no model and that it all depends on how \n\nthe liberating leader will articulate the liberating philosophy in the cultural context of \n\nhis company. Adopting a more prescriptive point of view, other authors like Tom Peters \n\n(1992) and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Laloux (2014) conceptualized an organizational system of liberated \n\ncompanies stating that the companies they studied had some patterns in common. \n\nHolacracy goes even further by claiming to have found an operating model of self-\n\nmanagement and to have started implementing it in more than 500 companies through \n\na network of coaches. \n\nRegrettably, every study on the subject is empirical and based on qualitative \n\nresearch methods, which does not help to compare companies objectively. A \n\nquantitative research would therefore allow to compare companies in an unbiased \n\nmanner and on a larger scale. Moreover, as it can be seen in the table below, the \n\nliterature often uses the same examples. In three books selected for the literature review \n\non liberating companies, many examples are common. Many academic case studies also \n\ncover the same examples. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 Comparison of the case studies present in the three main books on liberated \n\ncompanies \n\nTom Peters (1992) \n\nLiberation management \n\nI.

This \n\ndebate will be further explained in section 1.5. The current debate on the \n\nconceptualization of an organizational model, and can be summed up in the chart \n\nbelow: \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTo give insights to this debate, and to wider the span of companies researched, a \n\nquantitative study was conducted to answer the following research question: \n\nIs there a consistency of patterns in the organizational systems of liberated \n\ncompanies?  \n\nTo answer this question, 114 liberated organizations were identified, listed in \n\nAppendix 1. Based on this list, twenty-five main features within these enterprises were \n\nidentified. Then a survey was sent to the organizations, to discover to what extent these \n\nfeatures were consistent across the universe. From the thirty-nine answers collected \n\nfrom the survey, some consistent features within these companies were found. Among \n\nthese thirty-nine companies, only four have already been studied in the literature. \n\nThis study attempts to contribute to a better understanding of the growing \n\nmovement of liberated companies, by displaying some regular patterns in the \n\norganizational structures implemented by the liberating leaders. Many entrepreneurs \n\nand intrapreneurs found inspiration in the well-documented testimonies of these \n\nliberating leaders, but they still believe its implementation is risky and complicated. \n\nThey are therefore in need of more elements to start designing their organizations. \n\nTo articulate this understanding, this dissertation progresses as follows: first, the \n\nexisting literature was explored, focusing on the actual structures that may lead to \n\ndisengagement and some processes to dismantle traditional organizations. Then the \n\nconsequences that different worldviews on human nature have on organizations were \n\naddressed. Finally, the current debate on the idea of a model and its stakes for long-\n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nlasting organizations was explained. In the second chapter, the Methodology, is covered \n\nhow this literature review was conducted, how the research was designed and how the \n\nresults were analyzed. In the fourth chapter, the findings of our research are presented: \n\nwhich patterns were consistent, which patterns were less uniform and how larger \n\ncompanies deal differently with the liberation process. Finally, the last chapter \n\nconcluded this study by expressing the main contributions, the limitations of this \n\nresearch and the opportunities for future work. \n\n  \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1. Structure and people \n\nTo answer the research question, it is necessary to begin by identifying and \n\nexploring the concepts and existing theories directly related to the topic of this study. \n\nThis chapter will first review what structures disengage employees, then how some \n\nauthors presented the ideas of decentralization and delayering as a solution to this lack \n\nof engagement. Then, it will address how different theories on human nature, needs, \n\nand trust transition to different organizational systems. The last part of the chapter will \n\nexplain the current debate in the literature on the conceptualization of an organizational \n\nmodel. \n\n1.1. Organizational models that disengage employees \n\nSome structures like Bureaucracy, Taylorism, and Hierarchy lead to the \n\ndisengagement of employees, which in turn disadvantage organizations.  \n\n1.1.1. Bureaucracy, Taylorism, and hierarchy \n\nMost organizations today are operating on the base of top-down, hierarchical, \n\ncommand and control mechanisms. To better understand the origins of these \n\nmechanisms, the concepts of Bureaucracy, Taylorism, and Hierarchy were reviewed. \n\nThe Bureaucracy has been theorized by the German sociologist Max Weber as \n\nan organization based on procedures, policies, and hierarchy. The objective of \n\nbureaucracies is to show a \u201ctechnical superiority\u201d by forcing individuals into specified \n\npatterns of interaction. To achieve such a goal, organizations have to eliminate from the \n\nworkplace \u201clove, hatred, and all purely personal, irrational, and emotional elements \n\nwhich escape calculation.\u201d In a word, it \u201cdevelops the more perfectly the more it is \n\ndehumanized\u201d (WEBER, 1978, p. 975). Clegg and Courpasson (2004) also \n\ndemonstrated how the process of rationalization inherent in bureaucratization resulted \n\nin a diminution of freedom, by expecting employees to become obedient and by \n\nwithdrawing any of their initiatives. Consequently, they assert that bureaucracy was \n\nunable to handle contemporary markets\u2019 demand for constant innovation. \n\nTaylorism is another form of command and control organization that appeared \n\nduring the industrial revolution. Its objective was to facilitate a shift from a crafting \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nsystem where artisans used to have control over the entire production process to a mass \n\nproduction model where employee perform scientifically segmented tasks, thus being \n\nmore productive. This organization strongly limited the initiatives of employees, \n\nsubstituting it by the expertise of the design department and the white collars. In his \n\nbook \u201cThe Principles of Scientific Management,\u201d Frederick Winslow Taylor claims \n\nindeed that \u201cin our scheme, we do not ask for the initiative of our men. All we want \n\nthem is to obey orders we give them, do what we say, and do it quickly\u201d (TAYLOR, \n\n1911, p. 11). Every manufacturing process is fragmented into simple elements, \n\nmeasured, standardized, and the management should seek to limit an individual job to \n\na single task as far as possible, without any false movement. The part of the worker's \n\nactivity which consists of preparing and organizing the work in his own way is also \n\nsuppressed (LITTLER, 1978). I. Getz (2009, p. 143) described well the relation worker-\n\nmanagers that resulted: \u201cin this arrangement, the need for a \u201crelationship\u201d between \n\ncompany and employee is limited: Workers are given orders and told what to do and \n\nhow to do it. They are measured\u2014and controlled\u2014 according to whether they follow \n\nthem.\u201d Therefore, Taylor contributed significantly to the spread of mass production that \n\nFord already started with its moving assembly line. \n\nMore recently, Ronay, Greenaway, Anicich, &amp; Galinsky (2012) wrote an article \n\nnamed \"The path to glory is paved with hierarchy.\u201d They start their article by an \n\nanalogy with nature: studies have found indeed that in a group of chicken, the best egg \n\nproducers are also very competitive birds. Therefore, chicken fight over food, space, \n\nand territory, which in turn drive egg production down. The authors intend to prove in \n\ntheir study that for humans as well, having too many high-status individuals in an equal \n\ngroup can create status contests, people competing for greater control, which in turn \n\nwould increase discord and decrease the team productivity. \n\nTo prove this hypothesis, the researchers conducted experiments with different \n\ngroups of high-power, low-power, and baseline participants. The authors found that the \n\ngroup with a mix of the three groups, identified as hierarchically differentiated groups, \n\nwere more productive than groups of all high-power individuals and groups of all low-\n\npower individuals, especially in environments characterized by high levels of \n\nprocedural interdependence. \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThey conclude that unequal distribution of power within groups, i.e., \n\nhierarchical differentiation, facilitates the coordination of individuals\u2019 efforts and \n\nultimately benefits the productivity of the group. Therefore, they argue that \u201cdespite the \n\novert appeal of egalitarian social structures, humans have an enduring implicit \n\npreference for hierarchy,\u201d which they define as \u201ca universal default for human social \n\norganization.\u201d \n\nBureaucracy, Taylorism, and hierarchy may have led to significant increase in \n\nproductivity. For example, Taylor doubled the production of the company Bethlehem \n\nSteel after introducing its methods. However, as the founder and former CEO of Visa \n\nDee Hock puts it, \u201chierarchical command and control pyramids of power, whether \n\npolitical, social, educational or commercial were aberrations of the Industrial Age, \n\nantithetical to the human spirit, destructive of the biosphere and structurally contrary to \n\nthe whole history and methods of physical and biological evolution\u201d (HOCK, 1994, p. \n\n5).  \n\nThere is indeed a consensus to point out these methods as outdated. F. Laloux \n\n(2014) explains that humans evolve in stages, where everything changes at once, \n\nincluding organizational models. He describes in his book the evolution of different \n\norganizational stages: First, \u201camber\u201d organizations, like the military or the church, were \n\ncharacterized by highly formal roles and top-down command and control. Then \n\nappeared \u201corange\u201d organizations: they managed through objectives, valorized \n\ninnovation, accountability, and meritocracy. Later on, \u201cgreen\u201d organizations were \n\ndesigned, where \u201cwithin the classic pyramid structure,\u201d managers \u201cfocus on culture and \n\nempowerment to achieve extraordinary employee motivation.\u201d The liberated \n\ncompanies that he calls \u201cTeal\u201d organizations, would be part of the next stage of \n\nevolution. However, today most organizations are still at the amber, orange or green \n\nstage, and therefore create many pathologies in the workplace. \n\nThe problem is that these drawbacks are difficult to measure. F. Laloux admits \n\nthat \u201ceconomies of scale\u201d do arise when a support department take into account more \n\nresponsibilities, which \u201ccan easily be estimated in hard dollar figures.\u201d However, on \n\nthe other side of the coin, he asserts that \u201cit is virtually impossible to peg a number to \n\nthe diseconomies of motivation\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, p. 73). I. Getz (2009, p. 36) is \n\nreferring to these diseconomies as \u201cthe costs that your accountant is not telling you \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nabout.\u201d G. Hamel, a professor at the London Business School, claims as well that the \n\n\u201ccost of tyranny\u201d is very costly when the management narrows an individual\u2019s scope \n\nof authority. However, he also describes these costs in vague and unmeasurable terms: \n\n\u201cyou shrink the incentive to dream, imagine, and contribute\u201d (2011, p. 1). Nonetheless, \n\nthese descriptions are all pointing out the lack of engagement of employees, which \n\ncould be the major consequences of these organizational models. \n\n1.1.2. Lack of engagement around the globe \n\nSchaufeli et al. (2002, p. 74) defined the engagement of employees as a positive, \n\nfulfilling, work-related state of mind that is characterized by vigor, dedication, and \n\nabsorption. Vigor is characterized by \u201chigh levels of energy and mental resilience while \n\nworking\u201d and \u201cpersistence even in the presence of difficulties.\u201d Dedication refers to \n\nexperiencing \u201ca sense of significance, enthusiasm, inspiration, pride, and challenge.\u201d \n\nFinally, absorption is characterized by \u201cbeing fully concentrated and engrossed in one\u2019s \n\nwork, whereby time passes quickly, and one has difficulties with detaching oneself from \n\nwork.\u201d In this section, we will analyze the proven lack of engagement of employees \n\nand how it affects their productivity. \n\nTwo books quoted in this study are both referring to what the scholar Gary \n\nHamel calls \u2018the shame of management\u201d: the proven lack of engagement among \n\nemployees, in every part of the world. The first book, written in 2009 by the French \n\nprofessor Isaac Getz and the Wall Street Journal journalist Brian Carney, Freedom Inc., \n\nquotes a study from Gallup called \u201cGallup Study: Feeling Good Matters in the \n\nWorkplace\u201d (GALLUP, 2006). This study is regularly conducted in 142 countries and \n\nsurveys 230,000 full-time and part-time employees. In an updated version of 2013, it \n\nreveals that worldwide, only thirteen percent working for an organization are engaged \n\nin their work and \u201cwork with passion and feel a profound connection to their company.\u201d \n\nAmong the remaining eighty-seven percent, sixty-three percent are not engaged, which \n\nmeans they \u201cput time \u2013but not energy or passion- into their work,\u201d and twenty-four \n\npercent are actively disengaged. These twenty-four percent are particularly \n\npreoccupying since they are not just unhappy at work: they \u201ctry to undo\u201d \u201cwhatever the \n\nengaged do\u201d (GALLUP, 2013, p. 17). \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn 2006, the results appeared to be better, since twenty-seven percent of \n\nemployees were engaged, fifty-nine percent were not engaged, and fourteen percent \n\nwere actively disengaged (GALLUP, 2006, apud GETZ, 2009, p. 33). \n\nThe second book, Reinventing Organization, was written in 2014 by a former \n\nBelgian consultant, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Laloux. He quotes a survey conducted by Tower Watson \n\nin 2012, questioning 32,000 workers in 29 countries. The updated version of this survey \n\nfrom 2014 is more optimistic than Gallup results, finding that four employees out of ten \n\nare \u201chighly engaged\u201d. The other sixty percent are either \u201cdetached\u201d (seventeen percent), \n\n\u201cunsupported\u201d (nineteen percent), or as Gallup found out, \u201cdisengaged\u201d (twenty-four \n\npercent) (WATSON, 2014). \n\nUnlike the Gallup Survey, the results became slightly better over time: In 2012, \n\nthirty-five percent of employees were engaged, forty-three percent were detached or \n\ndisengaged, and twenty-two percent were feeling unsupported (WATSON, 2012, apud \n\nLALOUX, 2014, p. 62). \n\nAnother interesting insight of this book is to explain that such lack of \n\nengagement does not concern only employees at the bottom of the pyramid. Indeed, \n\nbased on his work as a consultant and coach, the author asserts that \u201clife at the top of \n\nthe pyramids isn\u2019t much more fulfilling\u201d since top managers also suffer from \u201cthe \n\npower games, the politics, and the infighting\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, p. 4). \n\n1.1.3. The negative consequences of lacking engagement \n\nWhether it reaches sixty or eighty-three percent, lack of engagement is proven \n\nto be high in the workplace and is also proven to have substantial negative consequences \n\non various dimensions. The Gallup studies from 2013 shows that the \u201cmedian \n\ndifferences between top-quartile and bottom quartile units\u201d in terms of engagement is \n\n\u201ctwenty-five percent in turnover (high-turnover organizations), sixty-five percent in \n\nturnover (low-turnover organizations), forty-eight percent in safety incidents, twenty-\n\neight percent in shrinkage, thirty-seven percent in absenteeism, forty-one percent in \n\npatient safety incidents, and forty-one percent in quality (defects)\u201d. \n\nTurnover, absenteeism, safety, quality, all these dimensions eventually impact \n\nthe productivity. And this link between the productivity and the engagement of the \n\nworkforce has also been directly studied. At the scale of a company, G. H. Seijts and \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nD. Crim (2006) studied the example of the \u201cNew Century Financial Corporation\u201d, a US \n\ncompany that found that \u201caccount executives in the wholesale division who were \n\nactively disengaged produced twenty-eight percent less revenue than their colleagues \n\nwho were engaged\u201d. On a larger scale, a study conducted by Towers Perrin-ISR (2007) \n\nusing data from over 360,000 employees from forty-one companies in the world\u2019s ten \n\nlargest economies, found that over three years, companies with highly engaged \n\nemployees increased their operating margin by 3.74 percent and net profit by 2.06 \n\npercent on average. On the other side, low engagement companies decreased their \n\noperating margin by 2 percent and their net profit by 1.38 percent. \n\nOnce one acknowledges that a large part of organizations is comprised of \n\nunengaged employees and that they underperform compared to engaged employees, \n\nmanagers try to re-engage these employees. For example, the CEO of the liberated \n\nIndian company HCL, Vineet Nayar, implemented the program \u201cEmployees First\u201d. He \n\nexplained in an article in the journal Forbes in 2010: \u201cWhat we want at HCL is passion. \n\nWe want people to be burning up with a desire to pursue their interests. Fascinated by \n\ntheir assignments. Jumping out of their skins with excitement about what\u2019s next. \n\nEagerly pursuing better solutions and new initiatives.\u201d Nevertheless, the question \n\nremains on how to achieve the goal of re-engaging employees. \n\n1.2. Deconstructing these outdated organizational models \n\nOne way managers have found to achieve this target is to deconstruct the \n\nexisting organizational structures like \u201cstandardization, specialization, hierarchy, and \n\nso on\u201d that are \u201cinadequate for the challenges that lie ahead\u201d (Barsh, 2008, p. 9). This \n\ndeconstruction has been done through processes called decentralization or delayering \n\n(also known as flattening). \n\n1.2.1. Decentralizing the hierarchy  \n\nPeter Drucker published in 1954 his book \u201cThe Practice of Management,\u201d in \n\nwhich he explains that \u201cso much of what we call management consists in making it \n\ndifficult for people to work.\u201d In this book, he presents an alternative, based on the \n\nconsulting project he implemented with Alfred P. Sloan at General Motors in 1943. In \n\nthis project, they decentralized the hierarchy, by letting the Direction Committee define \n\nthe general strategy and giving each Business Unit substantial operational autonomy. \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFrom this experience, he conceptualized a theory of management by objectives. \n\nIn this theory, objectives are derived from the goal of the company. Then, the objectives \n\nfor the managers are defined by \u201cthe contributions he has to make to the success of the \n\nlarger unit of which he is part.\u201d At the level of his unit, each manager set the objectives \n\nfor its unit himself. However, these objectives can be approved or not by higher \n\nmanagers. The \u201cgreatest advantage\u201d of such a management by objectives is \u201cthat it \n\nmakes it possible for a manager to control his own performance\u201d (DRUCKER, 1974, \n\np. 439). Indeed, once managers know their goals, they are able to measure themselves \n\ntheir results toward these goals. Such a process allows therefore to \u201csubstitute \n\nmanagement by self-control for management by domination.\u201d (DRUCKER, 1954, p. \n\n113). \n\nSuch a management by self-control implies that measurements, i.e., \u201creports and \n\nprocedures\u201d, are not seen as \u201can instrument of control from above\u201d and are considered \n\ninstead as \u201cthe tools of the man that fills them out\u201d (DRUCKER, 1954, p. 117). Thus, \n\nsuperiors should not have access to the information collected. Peter Drucker gives the \n\nexample of General Electrics, where auditors study every business unit at least once a \n\nyear, but where the reports go only to the managers of the unit and not to their boss.  \n\nThese principles, claims Peter Drucker, lead \u201cto a stronger motivation,\u201d a \n\n\u201cdesire to do the best, and better performance,\u201d along with \u201ctremendous advance in \n\neffectiveness and performance of management\u201d (DRUCKER, 1954, p. 113). The author \n\nMc Gregor also praised in 1960 the virtuous circle of a decentralization process. He \n\nstated that \u201ca decentralized organization provides an environment in which the \n\nindividual, through taking greater responsibility for his own behavior, obtains intrinsic \n\nrewards in the form of ego and self-actualization satisfactions, which in turn encourage \n\nhim to take still more responsibility and thus to grow\u201d (Mc GREGOR, 1960, p. 194). \n\nIn 1970, Robert Townsend published \u201cUp the organization\u201d, a book that has \n\nbeen for fifty years in the first position of the must-read book list at Wharton business \n\nschool. In this book, the former CEO of Avis argues that \u201cmost people in big companies \n\ntoday are administered, not led\u201d, and have been \u201cslaves to the rules of private and public \n\nhierarchies\u201d (TOWNSEND, 1970, p. 27). He came to a conclusion similar to Peter \n\nDrucker\u2019s management by objectives, arguing that people \u201cdon't have to be forced or \n\nthreatened. If they commit themselves to mutual objectives, they'll drive themselves \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nmore effectively than you can drive them\u201d (TOWNSEND, 1970, p. 93). In his view a \n\nreal leader \u201cdelegates as many important matters as he can,\u201d because \u201cthat creates a \n\nclimate in which people grow\u201d (TOWNSEND, 1970, p. 23).  \n\n1.2.2. Delayering the hierarchy  \n\nIn this view, managers still have an active role to play in the organization. Tom \n\nPeters (1992) writes in his book Liberation Management: \u201cit\u2019s not enough to \n\ndecentralize and create business units on paper.\u201d The management guru argues instead \n\nthat \u201cthe middle management layers and functional staffs must be virtually destroyed if \n\nautonomy is to get much beyond lip service.\u201d The literature presented in this section \n\nsuggest therefore to remove layers of hierarchy between the highest and lowest levels \n\nof organizations, a process known as delayering or flattening.  \n\nR. Townsend (1970) already advised firing the Personnel Department, a \n\ndepartment he saw as an abdication of responsibility. Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a Harvard \n\nprofessor that developed the concept of empowerment, was also in favor of some \n\ndelayering. Tom Peters, recalls in his book a conversation he had with her in 1989, \n\nwhen \u201cshe flatly declared that tomorrow\u2019s winning firms will have almost no middle \n\nmanagers\u201d (PETERS, 1992, p. 145). Gary Hamel published in 2011 an article \n\nevocatively named \u201cFirst, Let\u2019s Fire All Managers.\u201d He explains in this paper that as \n\nthey grow, companies need \u201cmanagers to manage the managers\u201d and therefore multiply \n\nthe layers of management. The author asserts that having more layers means slower \n\nresponses and \u201cincrease the risk of large, calamitous decisions\u201d (HAMEL, 2009, p. 11). \n\nAs an answer to these hierarchical levels multiplications, he advocates to \u201climit the \n\nfallout from top-down authority structures\u201d (HAMEL, 2009, online) and claims that \n\n\u201cincreasingly, the work of management won\u2019t be done by managers. It will be pushed \n\nout to the periphery. It will be embedded in systems\u201d (BARSH, 2008, p. 3). \n\n1.2.3. The persistence of a controlling hierarchy \n\nDecentralizing and delayering appear therefore as two effective solutions to \n\ndeconstruct the structures that demotivate employees. However, a recent paper from \n\nJulie Wulf (2012) is withdrawing mitigated conclusions on these two movements, \n\narguing that delayering does not necessarily mean decentralization and delegation of \n\nauthority and that it can have the opposite effect from their intention. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFirst, the author shows that companies delayered over the period 1986 to 1998. \n\nThis delayering concern mostly the middle management, through the suppression of \n\n\u201ckey senior management positions that served as intermediaries\u201d (WULF, 2012, p. 8). \n\nFor example, the Chief Operating Officer (COO) has become increasingly rare: \n\ncompanies with a COO decreased by twenty percent during this period of 1986-1998. \n\nMore generally, the number of positions between division heads and CEOs declined by \n\nabout twenty-five percent from 1986 to 1999. The number of positions reporting \n\ndirectly to the CEO increased from 4.5 in 1986 to almost 7 in 1999. \n\nOne could think that such reduction of the middle management would have led \n\nto subordinates having more autonomy since the CEO is time constrained and therefore \n\nhas less time to allocate to each subordinate. If CEOs pushed less their decisions down, \n\nthis would be a form of decentralization. However, Wulf inferred from this delayering \n\nthat CEOs had consequently a greater span of control. Delayering could also mean that \n\nCEOs have more direct connections deeper in the organization, and are thus more \n\ninvolved in the decision-making. In that scenario, a \u201chands-on CEO\u201d would \u201cexercises \n\nmore control and pushes decisions up\u201d (WULF, 2012, p. 11), which would be a form \n\nof centralization. \n\nTo prove her point, the author examined the salaries of functional managers. It \n\nappeared that as they move to the top, they get paid more. Suggesting that a higher paid \n\nis correlated with more decision rights, Wulf concludes that \u201cfunctional managers made \n\nmore decisions as they moved closer to the CEO, while division managers made less\u201d. \n\nThis means that functional managers make decisions previously taken by the division \n\nmanagers. \n\nTo gain even more insight on this idea of centralizing or decentralizing, Julie \n\nWulf went to interview seven CEOs of large U.S. Fortune 500 firms. She found out that \n\n\u201cflattening is not about delegation of decision-making to subordinates and a hands-off \n\nrole for the CEO. In fact, the most consistent message from the CEOs was that they had \n\nchanged the structure of their executive team and broadened their span of control to get \n\ncloser to the businesses.\u201d \n\nTherefore, this article showed that flattening actually transferred some decision \n\nrights from lower-level division managers to functional managers at the top. With CEOs \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nand functional managers becoming more involved in internal operations and \n\nsubordinate activities, companies actually became more centralized, with corporate-\n\nwide decisions and control being made at the top. So if delayering is not enough, more \n\nexploration is needed to examine how to re-engage employees in the decision process. \n\n1.3. The need for values to re-engage employees \n\nIn addition to deconstructing existing structures, which does not suppress \n\ncentralization as Wulf (2012) demonstrated, Mc Gregor (1960, p. 18) claims that the \n\n\u201creal need is for a new theory, change assumptions, more understanding of the nature \n\nof human behavior.\u201d Indeed, the beliefs of managers regarding human nature strongly \n\ninfluence the way they involve employees in the decision-making process, give them \n\nautonomy and liberty.  \n\n1.3.1. The importance of the managers\u2019 worldview \n\nDouglas McGregor was the first to link the vision managers have of their \n\nemployees and the organizational structure of a company. He developed these ideas \n\nfirst in his article \u201cThe Human Side of Enterprise\u201d (McGregor, 1957) and then in his \n\nbook with the same title (McGregor, 1960). According to this MIT professor, the \n\nquestion is not how to motivate people, but rather how to build an environment where \n\npeople self-motivate themselves. And the way managers make such environment, such \n\nleadership style, and such organizational model, is based on assumptions, \n\ngeneralizations, and hypotheses about human nature and human behavior, that is to say, \n\non a theory. McGregor distinguishes two main theories that he called theory X and \n\ntheory Y. \n\nOn the one hand, theory X assumes that employees work as little as possible, \n\nhave no ambition and are indifferent to organization needs. Therefore, they need to be \n\nmanaged with \u201ccarrots\u201d that is to say incentives like pay and bonuses and with \u201csticks\u201d, \n\nwhich are controls, threats, and discipline. This view assumes that employees prefer to \n\nbe led so that they can avoid responsibility. Frederick Winslow Taylor was indeed \n\nasserting that \u201cthe natural instinct and tendency of men is to take it easy\u201d (TAYLOR, \n\n1911, p. 19). \n\nOn the other hand, theory Y assumes that people find work enjoyable, and want \n\nto achieve higher-order needs through meaningful work. Having a meaningful work \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ninvolves taking decisions, providing inputs, making significant intellectual \n\ncontributions, having responsibilities. Employees\u2019 potentialities as human beings are \n\ntherefore partially utilized, and manager should further tape in their capacities of \n\nimagination and creativity. Then, explains McGregor, every employee \u201cwill exercise \n\nself-direction and self-control in the service of objectives to which he is committed\u201d \n\n(Mc GREGOR, 1960, p. 227) and \u201cthe individual will grow into what he is capable of \n\nbecoming\u201d (Mc GREGOR, 1960, p. 197). \n\nThese two very different worldviews can explain the conclusion of Wulf (2012) \n\nthat controlling hierarchies persists. Mc Gregor (1960) states indeed that \u201cthe needed \n\nchanges simply cannot occur as long as the underlying assumptions are those of Theory \n\nX\u201d. Therefore, \u201ceven fruitful concepts like those of delegation and decentralization are \n\nwarped completely out of shape when they are applied within this theoretical \n\nframework\u201d of theory X (Mc GREGOR, 1960, p. 156). \n\n1.3.2. From the managers\u2019 worldview to employees\u2019 needs and decision-\n\nmaking \n\nOn the other hand, how are operating the managers that have a Theory Y in \n\nmind? For Mc Gregor, such managers focus less on \u201cmanufacturing techniques\u201d and \n\nmore on \u201ccontrolling the climate and the fertility of the soil, and on methods of \n\ncultivation\u201d (Mc GREGOR, 1960, p. 192). Robert Townsend (1970, p. 96) has a similar \n\nmetaphorical recommendation: \u201cProvide the climate and proper nourishment and let the \n\npeople grow themselves. They\u2019ll amaze you.\u201d The reasoning of an employee is that \n\n\u201cunless I perceive that you can somehow affect my ability to satisfy my needs, you \n\ncannot influence my behavior\u201d (Mc GREGOR, 1960, p. 20). The remaining question is \n\nhow is the soil going to be fertile, what is a proper nourishment, what are the needs of \n\nemployees? \n\nAccording to Maslow (1943), the Hierarchy of Needs suggests that people are \n\nmotivated by physiological (food and water), safety (physical and economic), \n\nbelongingness (friendship, love, social interaction), esteem (achievement and \n\nrecognition), and self-actualization (realizing your full potential) needs. However, \n\nexplains I. Getz (2009), this view sees the human being as motivated to eliminate the \n\ntension of unsatisfied psychological needs. \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nI. Getz (2009) explains that Deci &amp; Ryan had a different view: they pictured \n\npeople as programmed for mastery and happiness. They developed a theory called the \n\nself-determination theory, which focuses on the needs of employees. It states that \n\nemployees have three intrinsic needs: competence (\u201csucceeding at optimally \n\nchallenging tasks and being able to attain desired outcomes\u201d), autonomy (\u201cexperiencing \n\nchoice and feeling like the initiator of one\u2019s own actions\u201d) and relatedness on the job \n\n(which concerns \u201cestablishing a sense of mutual respect and reliance with others\u201d) \n\n(BAARD, DECI, RYAN, 2004, p. 2). Therefore, in addition to the organizational \n\nstructures, a way to get employees engaged and \u201cself-motivated\u201d is to give them these \n\nthree \u201cnutriments.\u201d \n\nBaard, Deci &amp; Ryan (2004) found out that the satisfaction of these three intrinsic \n\nneeds is also strongly related (r= 0.58) to the perception of the degree of autonomy \n\nsupportiveness of the managers. Therefore, the best way to give employees these three \n\nneeds is to involve them in the decision process. \n\nA recent study by Travis L. Russ (2011) demonstrated that one of the outcomes \n\nof managers having a theory X or a theory Y view is how they involve employees in \n\ndecisions typically made by managers. On a study of 144 managers, he compared the \n\n\u201cpropensity for participative decision-making scale\u201d designed by Parnell and Bell \n\n(1994) with the \u201cTheory X and Y inventory\u201d designed by Sager (2008). The results \n\nrevealed that \u201ctheory Y managers perceive a positive consequence of soliciting \n\nemployee participation on their supervisory power and organizational effectiveness\u201d. \n\nOn the other hand, theory X managers consider that involving others in making \n\norganizational decisions \u201cnegatively impacts their power\u201d (RUSS, 2011, p. 1). \n\n1.3.3. The ideas behind empowerment, autonomy, and liberty \n\nSo, the ideas of Theory Y and decision-making are inherently interrelated. The \n\nauthors who theorized the notions of empowerment, autonomy and liberated \n\norganizations indeed have in mind strong assumptions about human nature. \n\nIn the 1990s\u2019, Rosabeth Moss Kanter constructed her theory of empowerment. \n\nConsidering the need for meaningful work described by the theory Y, she explained \n\nhow organizations could empower employees. Such empowerment implies a change in \n\nmanagement, insofar as Kanter acknowledges that \u201cgiving up control is threatening.\u201d \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nShe proposed two solutions to face this challenge. The first is for managers to trust their \n\nemployees and have less skepticism about their abilities. The second is to believe that \n\n\u201cby empowering others, a leader does not decrease his power; instead he may increase \n\nit\u201d (KANTER, 1979, online).  \n\nIndeed, liberated companies see employees as \u201creasonable people that can be \n\ntrusted to do the right thing\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, p. 97). Ricardo Semler built his \n\ncompany on this idea of trust. He explains that \u201cmost companies suffer from what I call \n\nboarding school syndrome. They treat their employees like children\u201d (SEMLER, 1999, \n\np. 7), whereas in their private lives, \u201cat the bank, at their children\u2019s schools, with family \n\nand among friends\u201d, people are considered as adults (SEMLER, 2004, p. 9). So, at \n\nSemco, they hire and treat people as trustworthy and responsible adults (SEMLER, \n\n1989). G. Hamel (2011) deplores as well how people as consumers have the freedom \n\nto pay $20,000 or more on a new car but have to ask many permissions to spend \n\namounts like a $500 office chair as employees. \n\nAs for the second idea of Kanter that empowering the bottom increases the \n\npower of the top managers, it is also a point view broadly shared. F. Laloux thus invites \n\nmanagers to \u201cacknowledge that we are all interconnected,\u201d which will lead to \n\nempowering employees since \u201cthe more powerful you are, the more powerful I can \n\nbecome\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, p. 135). The founder of Holacracy, Brian Robertson, also \n\nexpresses this idea clearly: \u201cNow I get to be a hero just like I did before, but now \n\neverybody else gets to be a hero too\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, p. 245). This notion of \n\nempowerment was also well expressed by David Marquet, the Captain of a US nuclear \n\nsubmarine he liberated: \u201cI don\u2019t care how smart you are, on my submarine, I\u2019ve got 135 \n\nthinking, active, passionate, creative, proactive, taking initiative people. It\u2019s a tidal \n\nwave!\u201d (Inno-Versity, 2013, video). \n\nIn addition to sharing this idea of trust and believing that empowering others \n\nwill increase managers\u2019 power, liberated companies go further by giving liberty to their \n\nemployees. Indeed, I. Getz asserts that giving only a bit of autonomy is a form of limited \n\ntrust (BYS, 2016). Likewise, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Laloux quotes Albert Einstein who said that \n\n\u201ceverything that is really great and inspiring is created by the individual who can labor \n\nin freedom\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, p. 86). \n\n  \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe leaders of liberated companies also stress this idea of freedom in their \n\nenterprises. Chris Rufer, the founder of Morning Star, states that \u201cif people are free, \n\nthey will be drawn to what they really like as opposed to being pushed toward what \n\nthey have been told to like\u201d (HAMEL, 2011, p. 4). Freedom is also one of the four \n\nvalues of WL Gore. The company highlights that they allow to employees \u201cthe freedom \n\nto grow beyond\u201d what they are doing, expecting employees to actually use this freedom \n\n(HARDER, TOWNSEND, 2017, p. 6). Ricardo Semler, the leader of Semco, also said \n\nabout his employees that \u201cthey can do whatever the hell they want. It's up to them to \n\nsee the connection between productivity and profit and to act on it\u201d (SEMLER, 1989, \n\np. 9). \n\n1.4. The new organizational structures emerging from these \n\nvalues \n\nOnce traditional hierarchies are dismantled, and managers have a strong trust in \n\nemployees\u2019 capacities (having the theory Y in mind), they create an adequate \n\norganizational structure. First, we will see that different type of hierarchies naturally \n\nemerge, and then we will analyze how companies built structures around these natural \n\nhierarchies. We will explore the case studies of organizations like WL Gore, Semco, \n\nSun Hydraulics or Morning Star, before analyzing how authors like Tom Peters, Isaac \n\nGetz, and Frederic Laloux conceptualized such organizational structures. \n\n1.4.1. The emergence of natural hierarchies \n\nDecentralizing, delayering, empowering, giving employees autonomy or even \n\nliberty, all these ideas do not mean the end of any hierarchy. Therefore, they are not \n\nnecessarily against the view of the article previously analyzed from Ronay, Greenaway, \n\nAnicich, &amp; Galinsky (2012) which claims that \u201cthe path to glory is paved with \n\nhierarchy.\u201d \n\nIn liberated companies, having no hierarchy of bosses over subordinate leave \n\nspace for \u201cother natural and spontaneous hierarchies to spring up\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, p. \n\n68). The case study about WL Gore explains how such a process happen: \u201cIf an \n\nassociate could convince co-workers a project was worth pursuing and gain individual \n\ncommitments, the associates formed a team, began experimenting and created new \n\nproducts for the company\u201d (HARDER, TOWNSEND, 2017, p. 5/6). Ricardo Semler \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nalso believed that if one \u201cput ten people together\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t appoint a leader,\u201d \u201cyou \n\ncan be sure that one will emerge\u201d (SEMLER, 1989, online), based on competencies and \n\nnatural leadership. \n\nFr\u00e9deric Laloux describes such processes as \u201cfluid\u201d and \u201cactualization\u201d \n\nhierarchies where what matters is recognition, influence, and skills. However, even if \n\nsuch natural hierarchies emerge, some other structures are still needed in liberated \n\norganizations. \n\n1.4.2. The structure of pioneers\u2019 organizations  \n\nThe story of Semco, a Brazilian success story, has been depicted in many papers \n\nand case studies, often by its former CEO himself, Ricardo Semler (1989, 1994, and \n\n1999). When Semco reached 3 000 employees, it had deconstructed the traditional \n\nhierarchical structure as described in section 1.2: They had no organization charts, no \n\nfive-year plans, no dress code, no fixed workplace, no human resources department and \n\nonly three levels of management (one corporate level and two operating levels at the \n\nmanufacturing units). It also organized itself according to three main principles: \n\ndemocracy, profit sharing, and information sharing.  \n\nAt WL Gore, an American company of 8 600 associates, the structure is called \n\nthe lattice. The Cambridge dictionary defines a lattice as \u201ca structure made from strips \n\nof wood or other material that cross over each other.\u201d Harder and Townsend described \n\nin a case study from 2017 how the company also deconstructed the traditional rigid \n\nhierarchy, by having no fixed or assigned authority, no organizational structure, no job \n\ntitles, and by having sponsors instead of bosses. The way they organize themselves is \n\ntherefore through natural leadership, person-to-person communication and by having \n\ntasks and functions organized through commitments. \n\nSun Hydraulics Corporation implemented a liberated structure under the \n\nmanagement of Bob Koski (KAFTAN, BARNES, 1991). In one of his first meeting at \n\nSun Hydraulics, he told the employees: \u201cI do not know what to do, but I sure know \n\nwhat not to do\u201d (GETZ, 2009, p. 67). Therefore, Sun Hydraulics does not have a proper \n\nhierarchy, no titles, no formal job descriptions, no special benefits, no reporting \n\nrelationships, no close supervision, and no \"intimidation functions\" like purchasing \n\nagent or quality inspectors. Instead, they implemented open communications, what they \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ncalled group self-management and the idea of having joint decision-making including \n\nthe person(s) most affected by the decision. They also have a written explicit philosophy \n\nand open offices, even for the CEO. \n\nGary Hamel describes the organization implemented by Morning Star as \u201cthe \n\nopposite of anarchy\u201d (HAMEL, 2011, p. 4). This American company was able to \n\nconstruct an efficient organization through various principles. The first one is to go \n\nfurther the management by objective designed by Peter Drucker. Instead of having a \n\nunit manager defining his goals, every employee is setting his own goals, by \u201cdrawing \n\nup a personal mission statement that outlines how he or she will contribute to the \n\ncompany\u2019s goal of \u201cproducing tomato products and services which consistently achieve \n\nthe quality and service expectations of our customers\u201d.\u201d (HAMEL, 2011, p. 3). With \n\nsuch a personal mission statement, named the CLOU, Colleague Letter of \n\nUnderstanding, every employee has \u201can operating plan for fulfilling one\u2019s mission\u201d \n\n(HAMEL, 2011, p. 4). Morning Star also operates with transparent data across the \n\ncompany, the consultation of colleagues for decisions, a conflict resolution processes, \n\npeer review, and elected compensation committee to ensure that pay aligns with value \n\nadded. \n\n1.4.3. The academic conceptualization of these new structures \n\nI. Getz describes liberated organizations as being \u201chighly disciplined\u2014actually, \n\nself-disciplined\u201d (GETZ, 2009, p. 53). These are some of the features he encountered \n\nwithin the organizations he studied: \n\n\u2022 No organizational charts \n\n\u2022 No reserved parking or corner offices for executives \n\n\u2022 No assigned executive offices \n\n\u2022 No fixed seating arrangement  \n\n\u2022 No managers \n\n\u2022 No time clocks \n\n\u2022 No titles or ranks \n\n\u2022 No Human Resources department \n\n\u2022 No budgets \n\n\u2022 No Finance department \n\n\u2022 No long-term planning processes. \n\n\u2022 Allow employees to pick their leaders \n\n\u2022 Allow employees to choose their own job descriptions \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Allow employees to set their own work times \n\n\u2022 Allow employees to set their own salaries \n\n \n\nTom Peters also analyzed the work of employees in companies without \n\npyramidal hierarchies. He compares the job of a \u201ccorner grocer\u201d, who is a \n\n\u201cbusinessperson\u201d, with the job of a \u201cline worker\u201d, who is \u201cfill[ing] a job slot\u201d. \n\nAccording to the author, \u201cemerging organizational forms will permit \u2013 and the market \n\nwill demand- that each employee be [\u2026] turned into a business person\u201d (PETERS, \n\n1992, p. 227). He also uses examples to describe these emerging organizational forms: \n\nIn the company Titeflex, a global leader in fluid management products, teams are \n\ncomprised of six to ten persons, with \u201cmost all the company\u2019s old staff functions in its \n\nmidst\u201d, like accounting and quality control. Each team is a \u201cgenuine profit and loss \n\ncenter\u201d and \u201cgoes out to visit customers and vendors on its own initiative\u201d, handling \n\n\u201corders from start to finish.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s liberation\u201d concludes T. Peters. He also takes the \n\nexample of Johnsonville Sausage, where workgroups are comprised of about a dozen \n\npeople, and they \u201crecruit, hire, evaluate and fire on their own,\u201d \u201cregularly acquire new \n\nskills as they see fit,\u201d \u201cformulate, then track and amend, their own budget\u201d, \u201chandle \n\nquality control\u201d, \u201cmake capital investment proposals as needed,\u201d and \u201ctake on the task \n\nof constantly improving every process and product\u201d. Also, \u201cperformance evaluations \n\nare done by the employees,\u201d then discussed with their \u201ccoach\u201d to eventually help \n\ncalculating profit sharing (PETERS, 1992, p. 238). \n\nHe then extracts from these examples a target organization and describes some \n\nfeatures that lead to what he calls \u201cBusinessing\u201d: \n\n\u2022 Extensive cross-training \n\n\u2022 Budget responsibility \n\n\u2022 Ownership of assets \n\n\u2022 Substantial spending authority \n\n\u2022 \u201cThe power to act on your own initiative and involve other functions without \n\nprior approval or second-guessing\u201d (PETERS, 1992, p. 235) \n\n\u2022 \u201cResponsibility for performing 80 or 90 percent of tasks that used to require \n\nnumerous steps, numerous department, and authority from several levels of \n\nmanagement\u201d (PETERS, 1992, p. 235) \n\n\u2022 Access to all financial information, access to extensive nonfinancial info \n\n\u2022 Access to expert systems, membership in a knowledge management structure \n\n\u2022 Global university (access to electronic bulletin boards, external databases) \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Laloux also draws from examples studied an organizational model. He \n\npresents in his book what he calls \u201cTeal Organizations\u201d, organizations based on three \n\nprinciples: self-management (a \u201csystem based on peer relationships, without the need \n\nfor either hierarchy or consensus\u201d), wholeness (\u201cpractices that invite us to reclaim our \n\ninner wholeness and bring all of who we are to work\u201d, instead of a narrow \n\n\u201cprofessional\u201d self\u201d), and evolutionary purpose (\u201cinstead of trying to predict and \n\ncontrol the future, members of the organization are invited to listen in and understand \n\nwhat the organization wants to become, what purpose it wants to serve.\u201d) (LALOUX, \n\n2014, p. 56). Within this model, he explains that \u201cself-organization is the life force of \n\nthe world, thriving on the edge of chaos with just enough order to funnel its energy, but \n\nnot so much as to slow down adaptation and learning\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, p. 134). The \n\nself-management depicted organizes itself through the following features: \n\n\u2022 Self-organizing teams  \n\n\u2022 Coaches w/o P&amp;L responsibility when needed  \n\n\u2022 Almost no staff functions \n\n\u2022 Coordination and meetings ad hoc when needs arise  \n\n\u2022 Radically simplified project management, minimum plans &amp; budgets  \n\n\u2022 Fluid and granular roles \n\n\u2022 Decision-making fully decentralized (advice process)  \n\n\u2022 Transparent real-time information sharing including financials  \n\n\u2022 Anybody can spend any amount of money provided advice process is respected  \n\n\u2022 Formal multi-step conflict resolution process  \n\n\u2022 Focus on Team performance, peer-based process for individual appraisals  \n\n\u2022 Self-set salaries with peer calibration, no bonus, profit sharing \n\n \n\nHolacracy is another model of self-management. It is the most operating one, \n\nready to be adopted and fully documented. The concept was developed by Brian \n\nRobertson at Ternary Software in the 1990s\u2019, and is now spread through certified \n\ncoaches, the \u201cnetwork of Holacracy Providers.\u201d They claim that now 500+ \n\norganizations are using this model. Holacracy is based on a minimum set of practices, \n\ndescribed in a constitution. F. Laloux describes in his book this model based on roles, \n\ncircles, and a specific governance: \n\n\u2022 People do not have a job, but fill a number of granular roles \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 On the company\u2019s intranet is a file where colleagues can \u201crate\u201d every role they \n\ncurrently fill \n\n\u2022 Each individual\u2019s commitments are visible to everybody at the company \n\n\u2022 Governance meetings are specific meetings where only questions related to \n\nroles and collaboration are to be discussed \n\n\u2022 A group of roles constitutes a \u201ccircle\u201d.  \n\n\u2022 \u201cCircles\u201d are fully autonomous to discuss and decide on how roles will be \n\nallocated within the team, what commitment team members make to each other, \n\nand so on. \n\n\u2022 Circle and sub-circle are bound together by a double link, not by a boss-\n\nsubordinate relationship. \n\n1.5. The current debate on the conceptualization of an \n\norganizational model \n\nAs we have just seen, scholars conceptualized a typical organizational structure \n\nfrom examples of liberated companies. However, they withdraw very different \n\nconclusions on how prescriptive this model should be. We will see in this section why \n\nsuch conceptualizations raise concerns regarding generalization and perpetuation of the \n\nconcept of liberated companies. \n\n1.5.1. A conceptualized model contributes to the transmission of leadership \n\nover time \n\nAt the end of his book, I. Getz (2009) asks a question without actually answering \n\nit: \"If it takes a leader with extraordinary qualities to build a free company, is it possible \n\nfor that environment to outlive its creator?\" The same question appears at the end of the \n\nHarvard Business School case study about the liberated company Sun Hydraulics \n\nCorporation (1991): the authors of the case wonder whether \u201cSun's organizational \n\npractices\u201d are an \u201cexportable method of management\u201d or \u201csimply a reflection of one \n\nperson's [\u2026] management style?\u201d \n\nIt appeared that at least six companies that once were liberated companies went \n\nback to stronger hierarchy after a change of ownership or the departure of the CEO. \n\nTwo of the companies studied in the book of F. Laloux, \u201cAES\u201d and \u201cBSO/Origin\u201d both \n\n\u201cachieved spectacular results during the two decades when they operated with a number \n\nof Teal practices and structures; however, under new leadership, they have reverted to \n\nmore conventional management approaches\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, p. 59). F. Laloux tells \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthe story of the buy-out of BSO/Origin by Phillips, which resulted according to its \n\nformer CEO Eckart Wintzen in the collision of two world, \u201cone of strict financial \n\nprocedures combined with \u201ccheck, check, double check\u201d with one of \u201chave trust, have \n\ntrust\u201d\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, p. 252). \n\nLikewise, in his book I. Getz studies GSI, a liberated French company at the time. \n\nHowever, in 1995 ADP bought the company which then became part of a group of \n\n56 000 employees. They replied in our survey that they do not consider themselves as \n\nfitting the definition of a \u201cliberated company\u201d anymore. Bob Davids, the former CEO \n\nof the 8 000 employees liberated company Radica Games, also recalls that this liberated \n\nculture was \u201ckilled [\u2026] within six months\u201d after his departure. At another studied \n\ncompany, USAA, \u201cthings had changed for the worse since Robert McDermott retired \n\nin the early 1990s\u201d confessed an employee to I. Getz. (GETZ, 2009, p. 196). \n\nThe Dutch author Ben Kuiken, author of the book \u201cThe last manager\u201d also visited \n\nin 2010 the famous Brazilian liberated company Semco, which reached 3 000 \n\nemployees under the management of Ricardo Semler. From this visit, he writes that \n\n\u201cSemler himself hardly interferes with the business\u201d and that \u201cbasically we are talking \n\nabout a real-Semco company with eighty people and that's pretty much it\u201d (KUIKEN, \n\n2016, online). \n\n1.5.2. A conceptualized model is a prescriptive model \n\nIn I. Getz vision, the \u201cliberated\u201d organization is more seen as a philosophy and \n\ntherefore depends more on the impulsion of a liberating leader and its values than on \n\nthe organizational model and what practices are implemented. Indeed, as he explains, \n\n\u201cas researchers, we began by seeking an organizational model of the liberated company. \n\nYet, we haven\u2019t found any\u201d (GETZ, 2017, online). The definition of a liberated \n\ncompany is merely based \u201con its function, giving liberty and responsibility to \n\nemployees, rather than by a set of structural features\u201d (GETZ, 2009, p. 35). It is the role \n\nof the leader to articulate this idea of liberty within the cultural context of his company \n\nand co-construct it with its employees. Moreover, \u201cunless one understands what \n\ntriggered people to engage in their lengthy efforts [...], reading about what they \n\naccomplished will be of little help for anyone wishing to replicate the feat\u201d (GETZ, \n\n2009, p. 61). \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn an interview for the French magazine \u201cUsine Nouvelle\u201d given in 2016, he even \n\nexpressed concerns about some misunderstanding about the concept of liberated \n\ncompanies: \u201cToday, a lot of people are saying that they started to liberate their \n\ncompanies\u201d, \u201cI receive a lot of emails from CEO asking for methods, recipes, \n\nsolutions\u201d; \u201cI almost find it worrisome. They stay in a simple organizational \n\nconception: reducing layers of hierarchy, suppressing some functional departments, the \n\ntimer. They didn\u2019t see what is from my point of view essential: the role of the liberating \n\nleader, who has to co-construct a unique organizational structure\u201d (BYS, 2016, online). \n\nHe also expressed similar concerns about Holacracy in an interview to the Dutch \n\nwebsite neworganising.eu, where he said that this model has two problems: \u201cFirst, that \n\nit\u2019s a model. As I explained you: there isn\u2019t a model. You have to find your own \n\napproach. But second, and even worse: I don\u2019t believe it will work. Some consultants \n\ntake the concept of holacracy, approach business leaders and promise them: four \n\nmonths, then it will be finished. Which is nonsense. [\u2026] It depends on the people. Let \n\nthem lead the change. Because that\u2019s the whole idea of the liberated company: that they \n\nare free, and can decide for themselves how they want to work together.\u201d (KUIKEN, \n\n2016, online) \n\nFinally, he also expressed in an article in the newspaper \u201cLe Monde\u201d in 2016 his \n\nregrets that Tom Peters focused fifty percent of his book on organizational structures, \n\nwithout mentioning the word \u201cliberty\u201d other than in the title and the conclusion. \n\nTwo liberating leaders share a similar opinion. Alexandre Gerard, a French leader \n\nwho liberated the group Inov\u2019On, wrote on his blog a similar concern, starting his article \n\nby saying \u201cI am very worried\u201d. His concerns are also about entrepreneurs who tell him \n\n\u201cI will do this, then that\u2026\u201d In his opinion, the question is not about \u201cwhat will I do\u201d \n\nbut about \u201cwhat will I let other people do?\u201d Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Zobrist, the former CEO of \n\nFAVI, also wrote a similar point of view: \u201cI strongly believe that there are no universal \n\nmodels [\u2026] What can be done is to listen to testimonies and get inspiration from them.\u201d \n\n(ZOBRIST, 2006, p. 4) \n\nThe authors of the paper \u201cSelf-organization: The irresistible future of organizing\u201d \n\nalso believe that \u201cthe path of self-organization can never be known ahead of time\u201d and \n\nthat \u201cthere are no prescribed stages or models.\u201d To implement self-organization, leaders \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nmust begin \u201cwith a strong intention, not a set of action plans\u201d and have \u201cconfidence in \n\nthe organization's intelligence\u201d (WHEATLEY, KELLNER-ROGERS, 1996, p. 8).  \n\nF. Laloux has a slightly different point of view. He wonders whether \u201cpioneers [can] \n\nprovide not just inspiration, but a template for those aspiring to create more soulful \n\ntypes of organizations?\u201d He agrees that liberating leaders play a very crucial role to \n\ninitiate the liberation process, which is a consensus within the existing literature. This \n\nidea was clearly expressed by Ralph Stayer, former CEO of Johnsonville Sausage: \u201cNo \n\none had asked for more responsibility; I forced it down their throats\u201d (STAYER, 1990, \n\np. 4). However, in F. Laloux\u2019s opinion, this condition is necessary but not sufficient, \n\nsince \u201cenlightened leaders don\u2019t automatically make for enlightened organizations \n\nunless they also embrace structures, practices, and culture\u201d. He also argues that such \n\nstructures, practices, and cultures are \u201cconsciously or unconsciously\u201d put in place by \n\nthe leader, in coherence with their beliefs (LALOUX, 2014). The liberating leader R. \n\nStayer corroborate this idea: \u201cI had come to realize [\u2026] that as a manager I didn\u2019t really \n\nmanage people. They managed themselves. But I did manage the context. I provided \n\nand allocated the resources. I designed and implemented the systems. I drew up and \n\nexecuted the organizational structure\u201d (STAYER, 1990, p. 6). \n\nA dialogue that F. Laloux had in 2017 with R. Semler helps understanding how he \n\nanalyzed such organizational structures. He considers that \u201cany framework can be very \n\nhelpful because it gives us the language to see patterns that we didn\u2019t see before\u201d \n\n(Laloux, 2017, podcast). However, even if he goes one step further than I. Getz by \n\ndescribing a framework, he still believes that his concept of Teal Organization \"isn\u2019t \n\nmeant to be read in a prescriptive way, as a list of structures and practices that must be \n\nrigidly implemented\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, p. 304). Therefore, Laloux\u2019s framework is \u201cnot \n\na list of fifteen things that will make your organization better\u201d (SEMLER, 2017, \n\npodcast). \n\nHolacracy, with its network of coaches trained to implement a minimum set of \n\npractices, seems to be the most prescriptive model. However, even such practices are \n\nseen as a minimal \u201coperating system\u201d, and different \u201capps\u201d can be added according to \n\nthe various needs of each organization. \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2. Methodology \n\nThis chapter explains the methodology for this research: how the literature review was \n\nconducted, how the research was designed and how the data was collected and then \n\nanalyzed. \n\nThe following chart from Kothari (2004) gives an excellent summary of the \n\nmethodological steps followed to conduct the research: \n\nFigure 2: Research process in flow chart \n\n  \n\n2.1. Literature review  \n\nTo better understand the liberated companies and its characteristics, a literature \n\nreview was conducted. Kothari defines two types of literature, \u201cthe conceptual literature \n\nconcerning the concepts and theories, and the empirical literature consisting of studies \n\nmade earlier\u201d (KOTHARI, 2005, p. 12). In the literature review conducted, both \n\nconceptual and empirical kind of literature were accessed. \n\nWe presented conceptual research to explain the concepts of Bureaucracy, \n\nTaylorism, hierarchy, decentralization, delayering, and to express the ideas behind \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nliberated companies. We analyzed surveys conducted by consulting companies to \n\npresent the subject of engagement.  \n\n In the following section, 1.4. The new organizational structures emerging from \n\nthese values, the research papers, books and case studies used to present the existing \n\nknowledge on organizational design of liberated companies were mainly empirical and \n\nqualitative. Indeed, I. Getz, F. Laloux, and T. Peters all observed and described about \n\nten companies each, helped by the interviews they conducted with the management. \n\nThe existing case studies on Semco (Semler, 1984, 1990, 1994, 1999), Johnsonville \n\nSausages (STAYER, 1990), WL Gore (Harder and Townsend, 2017), Sun Hydraulics \n\nCorporation (Kaftan and Barnes, 1991) are also empirical qualitative studies. We \n\nhaven\u2019t found any quantitative research on the subject of liberated companies. \n\nFinally, the deficiencies that can result from having only empirical qualitative \n\nstudies and the resulting debate in the literature on the existence of an organizational \n\nmodel were presented. \n\n2.2. Research Design \n\nOnce the literature review conducted, the research was designed. As Kothari \n\nexplains, \u201cdefining a problem involves the task of laying down boundaries within which \n\na researcher shall study the problem with a pre-determined objective in view\u201d \n\n(KOTHARI, 2004, p. 40). In this thesis, we had to define a universe within which we \n\nwould study our research question, define which organizational features we would test \n\nas hypotheses, and then design our survey.  \n\n2.2.1. Definition of the universe \n\nInsofar as the movement of liberated companies is growing in France, with Getz \n\n(2017) claiming that about 250 organizations are currently liberated, this study was able \n\nto use a quantitative method to answer our research question and test if there is a \n\nconsistency of patterns in the organizational systems of liberated companies. \n\nQuantitative methods, according to Sale, Lohfeld and Brazil (2002), seek to reduce \n\nphenomena into empirical indicators and variables. Creswell (2013) defines a variable \n\nas the attributes of organizations that can be measured and that varies among the \n\norganizations being studied. These variables can then be analyzed using statistical \n\nprocedures. \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKothari (2004, p. 18) then sub-classify the quantitative approach into inferential, \n\nexperimental and simulation approaches. Inferential studies aim at forming \u201ca database \n\nfrom which to infer characteristics or relationships of a population,\u201d which is exactly \n\nthe purpose of this study. \n\nTo design the universe that would be studied, two main sources were used. First, \n\nI. Getz implemented a Google group to debate and share information about liberated \n\norganizations. In this group, companies can on a voluntary basis apply to be recognized \n\nas a \u201cLiberated organizations.\u201d If the community considers that they fit the criteria, they \n\nare added to a map. On the 2nd of May 2017, the community was comprised of 1407 \n\npeople and the map listed sixty-one companies. Then, mostly from press articles, fifty-\n\nthree more organizations were also identified as liberated organizations. It is important \n\nto note that this identification was based on the features rather than on how these \n\ncompanies describe themselves. Indeed, behind different names like Teal \n\nOrganizations, Holacracy, Inverted Organizational Pyramid (HCL Technologies), Self-\n\nmanagement (Morning Star), Self-directed Teams (WL Gore) or Trust-based \n\nManagement (Semco) the same organizational principles were often found. A list of \n\n114 organizations was therefore established, which can be found in appendix 1. \n\nOut of these 114 organizations, 107 are private companies, four are public \n\norganizations, two are non-profit organizations, and one is a hospital. Eighty-seven are \n\nFrench (seventy-six percent), sixteen are American (fourteen percent), five are Dutch, \n\ntwo are Belgian, and four others are from India, Finland, Croatia and Brazil. This \n\nrepartition can be seen in appendix 2 and 3.  \n\n2.2.2. Organizational features of the universe \n\nTwo different types of research approaches coexist: the inductive and the \n\ndeductive approach. According to Babbie (2010), induction begins with observations \n\nand seeks to find a pattern within them. On the other hand, Wilson (2010) describes the \n\nprocess of a deductive approach as developing a hypothesis based on the existing theory \n\nand then designing a research strategy to test it.  \n\nThis study combined these two approaches. First, we inducted from secondary \n\ndata (books, case studies, papers, websites and interviews that mentioned these 114 \n\ncompanies of the universe) the existing organizational patterns of liberated \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\norganizations. This process led to the identification of thirty-nine different \n\norganizational features. \n\nThen, if five or more out of these 114 organizations were identified as sharing \n\none feature, such feature was considered significantly spread and therefore kept as a \n\nhypothesis to be tested. This process led to the selection of twenty-one different features \n\nout of the thirty-nine initial ones. Moreover, four other features that were shared by \n\nonly three or four companies but were emphasized in I. Getz and F. Laloux\u2019s books \n\nwere considered significant enough in the literature to be kept as hypotheses. Fourteen \n\nfeatures were dismissed. After this process the final number of features to be tested \n\nadded up to twenty-five.  \n\nIn the survey, seven other questions were added: two questions had the objective \n\nof identifying the model that best fitted the organization surveyed (Liberated \n\norganization, Teal organization, Holacracy or \u201cother\u201d). Lastly, five questions were \n\nasked to clarify some of the twenty-five features. The survey had thirty-two questions \n\nin total. The detail of this selection process can be seen in the table below: \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3 Features selection process \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWe used a deductive approach by testing the hypothesis that at least some of these \n\ntwenty-five features were consistent in liberated organizations. \n\n \n\nC\no\n\nn\nsi\n\nd\ne\n\nre\nd\n\n s\nig\n\nn\nif\n\nic\na\n\nn\ntl\n\ny\n s\n\nh\na\n\nre\nd\n\n \n\nC\no\n\nn\nsi\n\nd\ne\n\nre\nd\n\n \n\nim\np\n\no\nrt\n\na\nn\n\nt \n\nfr\no\n\nm\n t\n\nh\ne\n\n \n\nli\nte\n\nra\ntu\n\nre\n \n\nre\nv\nie\n\nw\n \n\nC\no\n\nn\nsi\n\nd\ne\n\nre\nd\n\n n\no\n\nt \nsi\n\ng\nn\n\nif\nic\n\na\nn\n\nt \n\ne\nn\n\no\nu\n\ng\nh\n\n t\no\n\n b\ne\n\n t\ne\n\nst\ne\n\nd\n \n\nA\nd\n\nd\ne\n\nd\n f\n\no\nr \n\np\nre\n\nci\nsi\n\no\nn\n\ns \n\n25 \n\n21 \n\n4 \n\n14 \n\n7 \n\nYES NO\n\nDi d you changed the names  of ti tl es  (ex: managers  to l eaders , empl oyees  to col l eagues )? 10 0\n\nDi d you changed the s pati al  confi gurati on of the worki ng pl ace? 19 0\n\nDo you have parki ng s pot res erved for the s eni or management? 1 6\n\nDo you al l ow empl oyees  to work remotel y? 9 0\n\nIs  there a ti me cl ock? 1 8\n\nDo you l et your empl oyees  s et thei r own work s chedul e? 11 0\n\nIs  the CEO away from the offi ce more than 2 days  per week? 5 0\n\nDo you have wri tten s hared val ues ? 5 0\n\nOnboardi ng trai ni ng l i nked to s el f-management? 5 0\n\nDo you have j ob des cri pti ons ? 1 6\n\nDo you have any organi s ati on chart? 0 6\n\nDoes  your company have s el f organi zi ng teams ? 15 0\n\nDoes  your company have a Human Res s ources  department? 0 6\n\nCan empl oyees  s et thei r own s al ari es ? 8 1\n\nIs  hi ri ng dependent on the future team acceptance? 8 0\n\nAre the managers  eval uated by thei r teams ? 8 0\n\nAre the managers  coopted by thei r teams ? 5 0\n\nDo empl oyees  have acces s  to al l  i nformati on, i ncl udi ng fi nanci al  one? 10 0\n\nDo you us e di gi tal  tool s  for s hari ng i nformati on or cons ul t col l eagues  ? 7 0\n\nIs  profi t s hared wi th the empl oyees ? 6 0\n\nDo empl oyees  have the obl i gati on to cons ul t peopl e affected by thei r deci s i on before taki ng i t? 6 0\n\nDoes  your company have a budget? 0 3\n\nDoes  your company have a control  department? 0 3\n\nIs  there an expl i ci t confl i ct res ol uti on proces s ? 4 0\n\nIs  there an expl i ci t meeti ng proces s ? 3 0\n\nAre there i ndi vi dual i zed bonus es ? 2 4\n\nIs  there a Di recti on Commi ttee? 0 2\n\nDo empl oyees  parti ci pate i n the Di recti on Commi ttee? 2 0\n\nIs  the s al ari es  di fferenti al  capped? 3 0\n\nIs  there a purchas i ng department? 0 2\n\nIs  there a s afety department? 0 2\n\n\"Li ke i t or l eave i t\" pol i cy? 2 0\n\nIs  there a \"val ues  day\"? 1 0\n\nIs  there an \"annual  arti s ti c event\"? 2 0\n\nCan peopl e choos e thei r trai ni ng? 2 0\n\nUs i ng peer feedback to s et up s al ari es 1 0\n\nIs  there an i ncubator? 2 0\n\nIs  there a proj ect revi ew commi tee 4 0\n\nIs  every meeti ng open? 2 0\n\nDo you cons i der that your organi zati on fi ts  the F-form defi ni ti on?\n\nIf not, how woul d you des cri be your organi s ati on?\n\nCan the management modi fy the budget?\n\nTo what extend i s  thi s  profi t s hared?\n\nIs  profi t equal l y s hared among empl oyees ?\n\nIs  profi t s hari ng dependent on the s al ary?\n\nIs  profi t s hari ng dependent on the j ob functi on?\n\nHow many companies \n\nout of 114 share a \n\ncommon answer?\n\n21 \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2.3. Survey design \n\nTo test this hypothesis, a survey was sent to the 114 companies identified in the \n\nuniverse, by the internet, through the website SurveyMonkey. One version was made \n\nin English, another one in French.  \n\nThis website allowed to track the emails sent, send a reminder to the organizations \n\nand quickly export the responses, thus being time and cost-effective.  \n\nFor each of the twenty-five patterns, the respondents had to state if these practices \n\nexist or not in their organizations.  \n\n2.3. Data process and analysis  \n\nThe data was processed using Excel. Out the 114 organizations who received the \n\nquestionnaire, forty-three responded (thirty-eight percent). Four company that provided \n\nincomplete answers were taken out of the sample. The final sample resulted in 39 \n\ncompanies to be analyzed, i.e., one-third of the universe (thirty-four percent). The \n\nanswers in French were translated into English.  \n\nThe respondents were classified according to their attributes (by type of \n\norganization: NGO, public organization or company, and by countries of origin) and by \n\nclass intervals (the number of employees).  \n\nBased on the literature review was then constructed a \u201cpercentage of \n\nliberalization.\u201d We assigned to each of the twenty-five features an answer that a \n\ncompany described as liberated in the literature would have given. If a company that \n\nwe studied was matching the answer assigned, a score of 1 was given, and if not, a score \n\nof 0 was given. This resulted in a score on 25, which was then translated into a score \n\non 10 for clarity reasons. The following table displays the answers assigned in the \n\nbeginning.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4: Calculation of the liberalization score through assigned answers \n\n \n\nA liberated \n\norganization \nwould \n\nanswer \n\nA non-liberated \n\norganization \nwould answer \n\nDo you have any organization chart?

The subsample attribute \u201ccountry of origin\u201d and \u201ctype of \n\norganization\u201d were too small to run a correlation analysis with the liberalization score. \n\nAverage, maximum and minimum functions were used to study the distribution of each \n\ntwenty-five pattern. \n\nThe results indicate that some features are common to the liberated organizations; \n\nas it can be seen in the table below. \n\nFigure 5 Percentage of companies implementing each identified patterns \n\n Yes No \n\nA liberated \norganization \n\nwould \nanswer \n\nDo you have parking spot reserved for the senior management? 0% 100% No \n\nDo you have written shared values? 95% 5% Yes \n\nDoes your company have self-organizing teams? 92% 8% Yes \n\nDo you let your employees set their own work schedule? 90% 10% Yes \n\nDoes your company have a control department? 11% 89% No \n\nDo you allow employees to work remotely? 87% 13% Yes \n\nDo employees have access to all information, including financial one? 87% 13% Yes \n\nDo you use digital tools for sharing information or consult colleagues? 87% 13% Yes \n\nDo employees have an obligation to consult people affected by their \ndecision before taking it? 76% 24% Yes \n\nIs the CEO away from the office more than 2 days per week? 74% 26% Yes \n\nIs profit shared with the employees? 74% 26% Yes \n\nDo you have any organization chart? 31% 69% No \n\nDid you change the names of titles (ex: managers to leaders, \nemployees to colleagues) 68% 32% Yes \n\nDid you change the spatial configuration of the working place? 67% 33% Yes \n\nIs hiring dependent on the future team acceptance? 66% 34% Yes \n\nDoes your company have a Human Resources department? 43% 57% No \n\nDo you have job descriptions? 44% 56% No \n\nDoes your onboarding training integrate self-management? 54% 46% Yes \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIs there an explicit conflict resolution process? 47% 53% Yes \n\nAre the managers co-opted by their teams? 44% 56% Yes \n\nIs there an explicit meeting process? 42% 58% Yes \n\nAre the managers evaluated by their teams? 32% 68% Yes \n\nCan employees set their own salaries? 28% 72% Yes \n\nDoes your company have a budget? 91% 9% No \n\nCan the management modify the budget? 75% 25% No \n\n \n\nThe result interpretation will be presented in the next chapter. \n\nLast but not least, three big companies (Airbus, Michelin and Decathlon) reached \n\nout to us after the survey was sent, to clarify that their response only concerned a few \n\nexperimentations and not the entire group. Therefore, a more qualitative method was \n\nconducted on the side to understand the articulation of these pilots with the headquarters \n\nbetter. Interviews were conducted: for Airbus, a Skype interview of two hours was \n\ncarried out with a researcher in charge of assessing the empowerment within the \n\ncompany, and for Decathlon and Michelin, emails were exchanged with a manager of \n\nthe enterprise. \n\n  \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3. Findings \n\nIn this chapter, we will present the results of the study. First, we will explain through \n\nthe literature the patterns consistent among liberated companies. Then, we will analyze \n\nthe patterns that are non-consistent. Finally, we are going to explain to what extent \n\nmodels are spread differently in larger corporations. \n\n3.1. The consistency of pattern among liberated companies \n\nThe main finding of our study is that even if it is the role of the leader to articulate \n\nthe idea of liberty within the cultural context of his company, as expressed by I. Getz, \n\nthese leaders end up putting in place some organizational structures and practices that \n\nare consistent among liberated organizations. \n\n3.1.1. A liberalization score fairly high among the sample \n\nThe thirty-nine organizations studied had a high liberalization score on average, \n\nespecially the thirty-two that defined themselves as liberated companies. \n\n3.1.1.1. Most organizations have at least half of the patterns previously \n\nidentified \n\nAs explained in the methodology part, we assigned to each feature a score of one or \n\nzero, and therefore each company ended up with a liberalization score from zero to \n\ntwenty-five, which was translated into a score from zero to ten. In general, the scores \n\nwere quite high, with an average of 6.7, meaning that on average two thirds of the \n\npatterns identified in the universe of 114 liberated organizations studied were also found \n\nacross the thirty-nine organizations which took part in the survey. This finding gives \n\nsome credits to our hypothesis that there is a consistency of patterns in the \n\norganizational systems of liberated companies. \n\nIndeed, eighty-seven percent of the thirty-nine companies of the universe had a \n\nliberalization score of five or more, meaning that most organizations had at least half \n\nof the twenty-five patterns identified in other liberated companies. Eighty-two percent \n\nof the universe had a liberalization score of six or above. The company with the higher \n\nscore reached a score of 9.6, and the lowest score was 1.7.  \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6 Repartition of the universe in terms of liberalization score \n\nLiberalization score of Number of companies Percentage of the sample \n\nLess than 4 2 5% \n\n4 \u2013 4.99 3 8% \n\n5 \u2013 5.99 2 5% \n\n6 \u2013 6.99 15 38% \n\n7 \u2013 7.99 7 18% \n\n8 \u2013 8.99 9 23% \n\n 9 \u2013 9.99 1 3% \n\n 39 100% \n\n \n\n3.1.1.2. Correlation with the type of organization \n\nAmong the thirty-nine companies that completed our questionnaire, thirty-two \n\nlabeled themselves as liberated companies, when seven others had other ways to \n\ndescribe their organization. Among these seven others, two companies considered \n\nthemselves as Teal Organizations, two considered themselves as Holacracy, one as an \n\n\u201cinverted pyramid\u201d, and two others didn\u2019t write down a proper definition. \n\nCompanies which labeled themselves as \u201cliberated organizations\u201d had on average a \n\nliberalization score of seven, whereas those who did label themselves in another way \n\nhad on average a liberalization score of 5.3. \n\nThis finding gives even more credit to our hypothesis of having consistent pattern \n\namong liberated companies. \n\n3.1.2. Very consistent patterns linked to the culture \n\nThrough the liberalization score, we found that eighty-seven percent of the \n\ncompanies in the sample implemented at least half of the features tested, giving some \n\ncredits to our hypothesis. In this section, we are going to break down this liberalization \n\nscore which aggregates twenty-five features, to find the most consistent features, and \n\nelaborate on them. Three features related to the culture of the company were present in \n\nseventy-four to one hundred percent of the sample, giving credits to the thesis of I. Getz \n\nthat liberated organizations are above all a matter of philosophy. These three features \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nimply the suppression of signs of privileges, the importance of values and a different \n\nrole for the CEOs. \n\n3.1.2.1. Suppressing signs of privileges \n\nOut of the thirty-nine companies surveyed, twenty-seven had a parking lot. Out of \n\nthese twenty-seven, one hundred percent did not have parking spots reserved for the \n\nsenior management. In organizations where the pyramidal hierarchy is suppressed, \n\nevery symbol must show employees that they are treated as equals. \n\nThis example is recurrent in the literature studied. Tom Peters (1992) illustrates in \n\nhis book \u201cLiberation Management\u201d the importance of getting rid of symbols of \n\nhierarchy through the story of Renn Zaphiropoulos. In 1984, this manager from Xerox \n\ncame to a more senior position. Consequently, he went to buy \u201ctwo one-gallon cans of \n\nblack paint and a paintbrush\u201d and \u201cbegan to paint out the labels on the executive parking \n\nspots\u201d. Robert Townsend also advised managers to show through non-symbolic \n\nmanners that they deserve their leadership positions: \u201cIf you\u2019re so bloody important \n\nyou better be the first one in the office. Besides, you\u2019ll meet a nice class of people in \n\nthe employee\u2019s parking lot\" (TOWNSEND, 1970, p. 83). \n\nMore generally, I. Getz mentions the importance of suppressing \u201call the symbols \n\nand practices that prevent your people from feeling intrinsically equal\u201d (GETZ, 2009, \n\np. 8). These symbols include \u201cmahogany executive floors and big corner offices with \n\nexpensive furniture, company limousines\u201d or as mentioned, \u201cpersonalized reserved \n\nparking spaces\u201d (GETZ, 2009, p. 75). Stayer, the CEO of Johnsonville Sausage \n\nunderstood as well the power of symbols, advising other top managers to \u201cstart by \n\nchanging the most visible system you directly control.\u201d In his case, this symbolic \n\ndecision was to give his employees the control over the quality control and the tasting \n\nof sausages. This \u201chighly visible action\u201d lead every employee to believe that he was \n\nactually \u201cserious about spreading responsibility\u201d (STAYER, 1990, p. 8). \n\n3.1.2.2. The importance of values \n\nNinety-five percent of the companies surveyed have written shared values. \n\nHowever, the literature makes it somehow unclear what to infer from this second most \n\nrecurrent feature.  \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nOn the one hand, liberated companies claim that written shared values help them \n\nevaluating the work of their employees, the values serving as a metric for guiding the \n\nemployees conduct in the absence of hierarchical orders. For example, Tony Hsieh, \n\nleader of Zappos, the largest Holocracy company, estimated in an interview with R. \n\nSemler that \u201cas long as it\u2019s in line with our core values, then we want our employees to \n\ngo for it\u201d (SEMLER, 2017, podcast). \n\nHaving written shared values also help to conduct interviews, onboarding new \n\nemployees and passing the culture along. For example, each new employee at FAVI is \n\ngiven on his first day the written shared values towards other employees (Good Faith, \n\nCommon Sense, Good Will, Cheerfulness), and below these values is written: \u201cI will \n\nbe judged on those values\u201d (ZOBRIST, 2006). \n\nNonetheless, others have considered that having its values written is either useless \n\nor not satisfactory enough. Ricardo Semler, for example, has reportedly asked some \n\nCEOs to write their values down on a piece of paper, before shuffling them and \n\nredistributing them, to show how these values are often \u201cidentical\u201d (FISHER, 2005). I. \n\nGetz and F. Laloux also both believe that having written shared values is not enough to \n\ncreate an efficient liberated organization. For the former, \u201cliberating leaders must live \n\nthe values they want to instill in their businesses\u201d (GETZ, 2009, p. 60) when for the \n\nlatter, it also \u201ctakes more than a document to bring values to life\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, p. \n\n153). Thus, companies need to translate the values into \u201cexplicit ground rules\u201d and have \n\nongoing value discussions through for example values days, values meeting, and annual \n\nsurveys. \n\nIf we can consider this feature as consistent, further research is needed to \n\ndemonstrate how the use of these values helps the liberalization of organizations. \n\n3.1.2.3. The role of the CEO \n\nWe found in our study that in seventy-four percent of the companies studied, the \n\nCEO was away from the office more than two days per week. \n\nAccording to a survey conducted in France, executives spend on average five weeks \n\nper year on meetings (WISEMBLY/IFOP, 2016). Once self-management is \n\nimplemented, then the CEO does not need to go to all these meetings to \u201cdo the hard \n\nwork of integrating conflicting perspectives into a decision\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, p. 102). \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u201cMuch of what gobbles up the agenda of company founders or CEOs falls away in Teal \n\nOrganizations. There are no more executive meetings, no steering committees \u2026 there \n\nare hardly any fixed meetings at all\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, p. 248). F. Laloux proves his \n\npoint with the example of the CEO of Sun Hydraulics, a publicly listed company, which \n\nonly had four meetings the week he met him, and two of these meetings were with the \n\nauthor himself. Ralph Stayer, the former CEO of Johnsonville Sausage also explains \n\nhow he began scheduling himself \u201cout of many meetings, forcing others to make their \n\ndecisions without [him]\u201d (STAYER, 1990, p. 9).  \n\nThere are many other examples of CEOs of liberated companies showing how much \n\ntime they have for themselves. Ralph Stayer, the former CEO of Johnsonville Sausage, \n\nexplains that \u201cfor the last five years, [his] ambition has been to eliminate [his] job\u201d, by \n\nhaving other people owning his problems (STAYER, 1990, p. 11). Jean-Fran\u00e7ois \n\nZobrist, the former CEO of FAVI, also explains that as a CEO, his goal was \u201cto do as \n\nlittle as possible\u201d (GETZ, 2009, p. 25). Having more time allows these leaders to pursue \n\nother projects. Bob Davids, the former CEO of Sea Smoke Cellars, once said to his \n\nemployees: \u201cI\u2019m gone for eight months\u201d, and told them that if they had any problem, \n\nthey should just solve it and send him an email with the solution (GETZ, 2009, p. 51). \n\nAlexandre Gerard, the CEO of Inov\u2019On, also undertook a round-the-world tour of seven \n\nmonths after having liberated his company. \n\nThe roles that undertake the CEO once his command and control mission no longer \n\nprevail can be diverse: He can become the \u201cculture keeper\u201d (GETZ, 2009, p. 8), \u201chold \n\nthe space for Teal structures and practices\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, p. 240) or role modeling \n\n\u201cvirtues such as humility, trust, courage, candor, vulnerability, and authenticity\u201d \n\n(LALOUX, 2014, p. 246). \n\n3.1.3. Very consistent patterns linked to the organizational structure \n\nIn addition to these three patterns that we linked to the culture of the companies, \n\neight other patterns widely spread are related to the organizational structures, giving \n\ncredit to Laloux\u2019s theory. These eight patterns are present in from seventy-four to \n\nninety-two percent of the companies in the sample. They relate to self-organizing teams, \n\nthe end of control, information and profit sharing. \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.1.3.1. Self-organizing teams  \n\nNinety-two percent of companies in the sample, i.e., thirty-six companies, have self-\n\norganizing teams. Parker, Holesgrove &amp; Pathak defined of a self-organized team as a \n\n\u201cself-regulated, semi-autonomous small group of employees whose members \n\ndetermine, plan and manage their day-to-day activities and duties under reduced or no \n\nsupervision\u201d (PARKER, HOLESGROVE &amp; PATHAK, 2015, p. 3). \n\nI. Getz studied the \u201cecosystem of ideas and models that influenced the construction \n\nof liberated companies\u201d (GETZ, 2012, p. 9). According to his research, it first started \n\nin the 1940s\u2019 with the Task Force implemented at Dupont. Bill Gore, the founder of \n\nWL Gore, worked at Dupont and would say later that \u201cthe task force was exciting, \n\nchallenging and loads of fun. [\u2026] I began to wonder why entire companies couldn\u2019t be \n\nrun the same way\u201d (HARDER, TOWNSEND, 2017, p. 2). \n\nZobrist from Favi explains well how such self-organizing teams have been \n\nimplemented. They \u201cbroke up the plant into some twenty self-directed, single-product, \n\nclient-focused \u201cminiplants,\u201d each of which was responsible for every aspect of its own \n\nbusiness, from hiring and training to purchasing, budgeting, and, of course, production\u201d \n\n(GETZ, 2009, p. 91). At Johnsonville as well, \u201cline workers assumed most of the \n\ntraditional personnel functions\u201d (STAYER, 1990, p6). \n\nHowever, as Tom Peters (1992) puts it, \u201cthe expert work must be done\u201d. \u201cThe issue \n\nis how \u2013 and where \u2013 to do it.\u201d Indeed, at Favi \u201cmost of the support functions had been \n\npared back or integrated into the miniplants themselves\u201d (GETZ, 2009, p. 91). But how \n\nis this \u201cmost\u201d defined? \n\nAccording to the Teal model by F. Laloux, when a problem or an opportunity arises \n\nthat requires some expertise, an ad hoc meeting is convened across teams. And \u201cwhen \n\na more permanent form of coordination is needed, a staff function might emerge from \n\nthe teams in a process of reverse delegation\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, p. 79). In a word, the \n\nmodel of liberated companies is that the frontline teams do everything, except for the \n\nthings they choose to push upward. \n\n3.1.3.2. Ending control to implement trust \n\nRules and policies are only giving managers a \u201csense of control\u201d which make them \n\nsafe, while it is, in fact, just an illusion of control which can in reality harm the \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\norganization (LALOUX, 2014). I. Getz (2009), quoting the former CEO of Chaparral \n\nSteel, explains how top executives usually implement control for the three percent of \n\nemployees who specifically outwit controls. He gives the example of a secretary who \n\nwas stealing office supplies; as a response, the top manager forbade the ordering of \n\noffice supplies during the summer, which certainly contributed to the disengagement of \n\nthe ninety-seven other percent of employees who did not steal. Ricardo Semler from \n\nSemco had a similar philosophy: \u201cI would rather have a few thefts once in a while than \n\ncondemn everyone to a system based on mistrust.\u201d (SEMLER, 1993). \n\nThe damages of control can also be explained through the literature on self-fulfilling \n\nprophecies. Rosenthal and Jacobsen (1968) demonstrated indeed how teacher \n\nexpectations influence student performance: having negative expectations influence \n\nperformance negatively. Thus, expecting employees to behave against the organization \n\ncould actually lead to such outcomes. Reversely, Rosenthal and Jacobsen have also \n\nproven that a positive expectation influence performance positively. \n\nLast but not least, controlling employees can also have the effect of taking \n\nresponsibility away from them. As the CEO of Johnsonville Sausages explains: \u201cone \n\nday it struck me that by checking the product, top management had assumed \n\nresponsibility for its quality. We were not encouraging people to be responsible for their \n\nown performance\u201d (STAYER, 1990, p. 6). As a result, they asked the top management \n\nto stop tasting sausage, and the people who made sausage started assuming the quality \n\ncontrol. As a result, rejects fell from five percent to less than 0.5 percent. \n\nThese ideas of ending control are very consistent with the ideas expressed in section \n\n1.3.3. The ideas behind empowerment, autonomy, and liberty. In our study we found \n\ntherefore that ninety percent of the companies surveyed let their employees set their \n\nown work schedule, eighty-nine percent do not have a control department, and eighty-\n\nseven percent allow their employees to work remotely. \n\n3.1.3.3. The importance of sharing information \n\nF. Laloux outlines three main reasons for liberated companies to share information, \n\nincluding financial information. First, it allows the self-managed teams to \u201cmake the \n\nbest decisions\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, p. 113). Ricardo Semler (1989) understood well that \n\ninformation would help workers figure out what is working and what is not. For this \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\npurpose, each month employees received a balance sheet, an income statement and a \n\ncash flow statement. Moreover, they also received training to read and understand these \n\ndocuments. Thus, employees knew \u201chow much bronze is costing us, how much \n\novertime we paid, all of it\u201d (SEMLER, 1989, online). Later on, the company went even \n\nfurther by letting everybody know how much everyone was making and by leaving any \n\nmeeting open to anyone. Wheatley and Kellner-Rogers also adds the idea that \u201cthere is \n\na need for many more eyes and ears\u201d, because \u201cwhen information is available \n\neverywhere, different people see different things\u201d, for example, \u201cthose with a more \n\nstrategic focus will see opportunities that others can't discern\u201d (WHEATLEY AND \n\nKELLNER-ROGERS, 1996, p. 6). This explains partly why Semco entered businesses \n\nthat were not in its core business after some employees expressed an opportunity in it, \n\nsuch as managing cooling-tower maintenance (SEMLER, 1999). \n\nThe second reason given by F. Laloux is that \u201cany information that isn\u2019t public will \n\ncause suspicion, [\u2026] and suspicion is toxic for organizational trust\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, \n\np. 113). Stan Richard, the leader of the liberated company the Richards Group, believed \n\nin the same principle: \u201cThe only way to defeat paranoia is by not keeping secrets, and \n\nso everyone is allowed to know everything\u201d (GETZ, 2009, p. 157). \n\nFinally, F. Laloux\u2019s third argument is that \u201cinformal hierarchies reemerge when \n\nsome people are in the know while others are not\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, p. 113). Stan \n\nRichard also understood this concept, revealing that in his company \u201cthere are no \n\nunimportant people here and therefore, information should go to everyone at exactly \n\nthe same moment\u201d (GETZ, 2009, p. 157). \n\nThese three arguments explain well one main result of our study: eighty-seven \n\npercent of the companies studied are giving their employees access to all information, \n\nincluding financial one. \n\nF. Laloux emphasizes as well how \u201cinformation technology tools such as internal \n\nsocial networks and knowledge repositories can play a critical role in steering clear of \n\nunnecessary structures\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, p. 79). We indeed found that eighty-seven \n\npercent of the liberated companies studied use digital tools for sharing information or \n\nconsult colleagues. This very last principle of consulting colleagues is also quite \n\nspecific in liberated companies, as we are going to see now. \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.1.3.4. The consultation process \n\nIn the absence of hierarchy, our literature review displayed a unique process of \n\ndecision-making. Indeed, having employees deciding for themselves does not mean that \n\nthey decide by themselves. F. Laloux depicts this process as follows: \u201cany person can \n\nmake any decision but must seek advice from affected parties and people with \n\nexpertise\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, p. 100). This process relates to the decision-making \n\nprocess \u201cCI\u201d expressed by Vroom and Yetton (1973) in their Normative Decision \n\nTheory, where \u201cthe leader shares the problem and gets ideas and suggestions from \n\nrelevant employees on an individual basis. Then the leader makes the decision, which \n\nmay or may not reflects their input\u201d (WILLIAMS, 2017, p. 302). However, in the case \n\nof liberated companies, every employee gets to be a leader.  \n\nI. Getz encountered similar decision processes, existing under different names in \n\nthe companies he studied. For example at GSI, such practice was called the \u201cduty to \n\nconsult\u201d, and at IDEO exists the \u201cprinciple of consulting on decisions that may affect \n\nothers\u201d (GETZ, 2009, p. 176). At Gore also, people were expected to \u201cconsult with \n\nother associates before undertaking actions that could impact the reputation and \n\nprofitability of the company\u201d (HARDER AND TOWNSEND, 2017, p. 6). \n\nThus, we found in our study that seventy-six percent of the thirty-nine companies \n\nstudied implemented a rule where employees must consult people affected by their \n\ndecision before taking it. \n\n3.1.3.5. Profit sharing \n\nIn the literature studied, profit sharing is not mentioned very often as a characteristic \n\nof a liberated company, besides by Ricardo Semler and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Laloux. The former, \n\nwho introduced a distribution of twenty-three percent of the after-tax profit, explains \n\nthat profit sharing gives the employees a reason to do their job better. The latter also \n\nbriefly mention \u201cequal profit sharing\u201d as a practice of Teal Organizations (LALOUX, \n\n2014, p. 328) without giving further examples. \n\nFrom our study, it seems however that this is quite a common practice among \n\nliberated companies, with seventy-four percent of companies surveyed sharing their \n\nprofits with their employees (twenty-eight of the thirty-eight companies that answered \n\nthis question). \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAs explained in the Methodology chapter, we included in our survey questions to \n\nclarify the answers of the respondents. In the case of profit sharing, we asked companies \n\nto detail how they were sharing these profits (what percentage was shared, and \n\nfollowing what scheme). Among the twenty-eight companies that share profits, twenty-\n\nfour accepted to display their sharing pattern. And it appears that thirteen of them (fifty-\n\nfour percent) share more than twenty percent of their profits with their employees. As \n\nit can be seen in the chart below, surveyed companies usually extensively share their \n\nprofits. \n\nFigure 7: Percentage of profit that is shared with employees, among companies that share \n\nprofits and communicated their sharing pattern \n\n \n\nIt is also worth noting that out of the twenty-eight businesses that share their profits, \n\ntwenty-six indicated how they share it among their employees. The majority (fifteen) \n\nare sharing it equally among employees. Four make the profit sharing depend on the \n\nsalary, and make it depend on the job function. Two other companies announced that \n\nthey shared it equally among employees and that it depended on the salary, and three \n\nindicated that it was shared equally and depended on the job function. \n\n3.2. Inconsistent patterns \n\nIn addition to these eleven patterns we identified as widely spread, fourteen other \n\nfeatures were considered not entirely consistent, giving credit to the theory of I. Getz \n\nthat liberated companies articulate the idea of liberty within a specific context. Ten \n\nfeatures were present in the majority of the organizations, and four were rarely spread. \n\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60%\n\n> 20%\n\n10&lt;>20%\n\n5%&lt;>10%\n\n&lt;5%\n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.1. Patterns present in the majority of organizations \n\nThis section will briefly analyze the ten patterns that were found in the majority of \n\norganizations, on a range from forty-two to sixty-nine percent of the companies. They \n\nconcern either the way employees evolve in the company or some general human \n\nresources practices. \n\n3.2.1.1. The evolution of an employee in the company \n\nAs T. Peters (1992) explained, \u201cthe ladder that managers aspired to climb is being \n\nturned to kindling in the liberated, horizontal, beyond hierarchy environment.\u201d \n\nLikewise, Ricardo Semler stated that \u201cthe idea that I will hire you, I will train you, I \n\nwill want to know where you want to be in five years, and then I will give you that \n\nbetter job is totally out of the question\u201d (SEMLER, 2004, p. 2). Thus, how is the career \n\npath of an employee in a liberated company differently paved? \n\nFirst, hiring is considered very important in liberated organizations. For example, \n\nat Morning Star, the majority of applicants\u2019 interview is focused \u201con assessing the fit \n\nbetween Morning Star\u2019s philosophy and the applicant\u2019s expectations\u201d (HAMEL, 2011, \n\np. 6). Many liberated companies go further by making the hiring dependent on the future \n\nteam acceptance. For example, at Semco applicants are not hired \u201cuntil they've been \n\ninterviewed and accepted by all their future subordinates\u201d (SEMLER, 1989). The \n\nfindings show that two-thirds (sixty-six percent) of the companies surveyed \n\nimplemented this practice. \n\nOnce hired, since \u201cthe first days and weeks are critical to making someone feel that \n\nshe has come into a new and different workplace\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, p. 176), the \n\nonboarding process usually integrates some training about self-management. This is the \n\ncase with fifty-four percent of the organizations surveyed. \n\nBesides, once the employees are fully part of the organizations, to access leadership \n\npositions, in forty-four percent of the liberated companies surveyed, managers have to \n\nbe co-opted by their teams, which means that each team has to appoint its leader. WL \n\nGore went even further this idea by letting a board of pooled employees pick their next \n\nleader as a company. The board was able to name any worker and chose in 2005 Terri \n\nKelly, an employee who worked twenty-two years at WL Gore to be the next CEO. She \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nreported being \u201cas shocked as the next person\u201d by this decision. (STERN, MARSH, \n\n2008, p. 2). \n\nTwo other working practices are linked to explicit processes for formal interactions \n\namong employees: The first one is a process to resolve conflicts, which is viewed by \n\nLaloux as \u201cfundamental to collaboration without hierarchy\u201d. Indeed, in the absence of \n\nformal hierarchies, it can feel uncomfortable to step up and hold a colleague \n\naccountable for its previous commitments. In such scenarios, \u201ca clearly outlined \n\nconflict resolution process helps people confront each other\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, p. 112 \n\nand p. 114). At Morning Star, the resolution process works as follow when two \n\nemployees cannot agree: They first pick a mediator. If this mediation fails, they convene \n\na jury of six colleagues to settle the disagreement. If the conflict is still unresolved after \n\nthat, \u201cthe company's president holds the determining gave\u201d (LIBERMAN, 2013, p. 8). \n\nA similar specific conflict resolution process was found present in forty-seven percent \n\nof the surveyed companies. This percentage can be considered significant since F. \n\nLaloux, a former consultant, recalls in his book to had \u201cnever encountered a company \n\nwith an explicit conflict resolution mechanism\u201d before (LALOUX, 2014, p. 114). \n\nThe second process concerns meetings. As previously mentioned, executives spend \n\nfive weeks per year in meetings, and thirty-five percent of them consider that half of \n\nthese meetings are unproductive (WISEMBLY/IFOP, 2016). According to F. Laloux, \n\nthis unproductivity happens because \u201cmore often than not, meetings in companies turn \n\ninto playfields for the egos\u201d. This is why almost all the organizations he studied \u201chave \n\ninstituted specific meeting practices to help participants keep their egos in check\u201d \n\n(LALOUX, 2014, p. 162). They ensure \u201cthat every voice is heard, that the collective \n\nintelligence informs decision-making, and that no one person can derail the process and \n\nhold others hostage trying to impose her personal preferences\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, p. \n\n68). Forty-two percent of the companies which completed our survey indeed reported \n\nhaving an explicit meeting process. \n\n3.2.1.2. Human resources common practices \n\nForty-three percent of the companies surveyed did not have a Human Resources \n\ndepartment. However, they did implement some relevant practices in terms of human \n\nresources. \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFor example, sixty-nine percent of them did not have an organization chart. Robert \n\nTownsend compared these charts to pigeonholes where people are trapped. Therefore, \n\nhe advised to not \u201cprint and circulate organizational charts\u201d, because \u201cevery man-and \n\nwoman-is a human being, not a rectangle\u201d (TOWNSEND, 1970, p. 144). At Sun \n\nHydraulics, leaders also believe that such organizational charts \u201cforce individuals into \n\ndefensive, unproductive and damaging behavior patterns\u201d (KAFTAN AND BARNES, \n\n1991, p. 2). One of these behavior patterns expresses itself through the process of \n\npromotion. The CEO of Sun Hydraulics, Bob Koski, warns indeed against situations \n\nwhere \u201cit becomes more important that a person knows how the business works \n\ninternally than anything about the external activities of the company\u201d and where \n\n\u201cpeople only look at sideways to see who is above whom\u201d (KAFTAN AND BARNES, \n\n1991, p. 2). \n\nFollowing a similar principle, sixty-eight percent of the organizations studied also \n\ndecided to change the names of titles (for example: managers to leaders, employees to \n\ncolleagues). This practice is also aligned with the idea of suppressing every sign of \n\nhierarchy. Bill Gore believed indeed \u201cthat the way we talk about one another and about \n\nour jobs affects the way we think and the way we act\u201d (GETZ, 2009, p. 13). Therefore, \n\nat WL Gore, every employee has the same job title of Associate.  \n\nLikewise, fifty-six percent of the survey respondents do not have job descriptions. \n\nMany organizations view job descriptions as rigid ways to tell people how to do their \n\nwork. Semler (1999) condemned this practice of hiring people for specific jobs and \n\nkeeping them in one career track, without taking into account what they desire are. On \n\nthe contrary, in a system like Holacracy for example, people are not considered as \n\nhaving a rigid job; they simply fill a number of roles that evolve with the company \n\nneeds. \n\nLastly, another recurrent idea in the literature is the change of spatial configuration \n\nof the working place, to allow better communication between employees. For example, \n\nTom Peters (1992) described in his book how the building of the company 3M has been \n\ndesigned \u201cto foster waves, to increase the probability that a useful particle [person] will \n\ncome into contact with another useful particle\u201d. In addition to designing the workplace \n\nto increase interactions among different functions, there are various examples in the \n\nliterature of equality of working conditions, with managers going from corner offices \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nto cubicles in the center of the open space, or even next to the factory machines. In our \n\npreliminary study to select patterns among the 114 organizations, the change of spatial \n\nconfiguration was the most commonly implemented feature, with nineteen occurrences \n\nin the universe of 114 organizations. Among the companies which answered our survey, \n\ntwo-thirds (sixty-seven percent) took this initiative of changing the configuration of the \n\nworkplace. \n\n3.2.2. Some patterns rarely spread \n\nThen four patterns were not significantly spread, with only nine to thirty-two \n\npercent of the companies implementing them. \n\nEven if it is quite common for liberated companies to make the hiring process \n\ndependent on the future team acceptance and allow teams to co-opt their managers, it \n\nseems however that the evaluation of the managers by their own teams is present in \n\nonly about one-third of the surveyed companies (thirty-two percent). This type of \n\nassessment by a subordinate is, for example, happening at Semco twice a year. \n\nThe process of letting the employees set their own salaries is presented by F. Laloux \n\nas a common pattern of Teal Organizations. This practice was noticeably established \n\nby Semco, where the 3 000 employees could choose their salaries individually, after a \n\nbenchmark with their colleagues and the industry competitors. However, only twenty-\n\neight percent of the companies which answered the survey adopted such a practice. \n\nSince liberated companies are trying to \u201csense and respond\u201d rather than \u201cpredict \n\nand control\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, p. 209), and since the budget embodies this idea of \n\nprediction, Laloux asserts that \u201cmany of these companies don\u2019t create any budget at all\u201d \n\n(LALOUX, 2014, p. 213). However, only nine percent of the businesses that answered \n\nour questionnaire did not have a budget. \n\nF. Laloux goes further by stating that \u201cif a budget is established, there is no tweaking \n\nfrom above. Whatever numbers the teams forecast become the budget\u201d (LALOUX, \n\n2014, p. 213). Amongst the ninety-one percent of organizations which do have a budget, \n\nonly twenty-five percent do not allow the top management to modify it. \n\nThe findings on the features found in the sample are summarized in the table below: \n\nFigure 8 Repartition of the features across the sample \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3. Spreading a model in larger corporations \n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Laloux in his book claims that \u201cthe principles and practices\u201d of liberated \n\ncompanies \u201ccan be adopted by small and large organizations alike\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, \n\np. 238). The way these practices are implemented in major companies is peculiar and \n\nwill be presented in the next section. \n\n3.3.1. The degree of liberalization is correlated with the size of the companies \n\nSince the company with the lowest liberalization score (1,7 out of 10) is the \n\ncompany with the most employees (56 000), and the company with the highest \n\nliberalization score (9.6) is a company with only nine employees, the comparison of the \n\nliberalization score with the size of the companies studied was undertaken. As it can be \n\nclearly seen in the table below, in the sample the more employees a company has, the \n\nless liberated the company is. \n\nFigure 9 Comparison of the number of employees with the percentage of liberalization \n\nNumber of employees \nAverage percentage of \n\nliberalization of the cluster \n\nNumber of companies in \n\nthe cluster \n\n0-10 71% 7 \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n11-20 75% 10 \n\n21-80 71% 9 \n\n81-400 65% 7 \n\n400-56000 46% 6 \n\n  39 \n\nI. Getz (2015) in an interview considered indeed that a liberation process could take \n\nup to three years for a small and medium-sized enterprise and up to ten years for larger \n\norganizations, suggesting stronger barriers for large companies.  \n\n3.3.2. Limiting the size of teams \n\nF. Laloux asserts in his book that \u201cwhen organizations grow larger, say beyond \n\ntwenty employees, running the show as a single team becomes unpractical\u201d (LALOUX, \n\n2014, p. 323). Therefore, to tackle this issue of the size, large corporations have divided \n\ntheir facilities into self-managed teams of limited numbers of employees. Such modest \n\nsize units have the advantage of being \u201cadaptable enough and responsive enough\u201d \n\n(PETERS, 1992, p. 383), and are considered \u201cessential for putting employees in touch \n\nwith one another so they can coordinate their work\u201d (SEMLER, 1989, p. 3). However, \n\nscholars are quite divided on the optimal size of such \u201cmodest size\u201d units. \n\nFor the anthropologist R. Dunbar, \"the figure of 150 seems to represent the \n\nmaximum number of individuals with whom we can have a genuinely social \n\nrelationship, the kind of relationship that goes with knowing who they are and how they \n\nrelate to us\u201d (DUNBAR, 1998, p. 77). And as Bill Gore (1985) puts it, \u201ca precipitous \n\ndrop in cooperation appears as the group size becomes large enough so that everyone \n\nno longer \u201cknows\u201d everyone else\u201d. This is why in his company Gore, and also at Semco, \n\nthe number of associate per team/facilities/factory could not exceed 150. \n\nAt Sun Hydraulics, the teams are even larger, kept under \u201c200 to 250 employees in \n\nany location\u201d (Kaftan and Barnes, 1991, p. 1). \n\nHowever, T. Peters (1992) found most often teams comprised of fifty or sixty \n\nemployees, with some exceptions comprised of thirty-five or 200 people. This number \n\nis more consistent with our findings. Out of the thirty-six companies studied that have \n\nself-organizing teams, twenty-eight have indicated of how many people maximum \n\nthese teams were comprised. For all of them but one (twenty-seven), the teams did not \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ngo above fifty people. The twenty-eighth company said that all of its employees (300 \n\npeople) were actually a self-organizing team. Five other companies of less than fifty \n\nemployees also declared that all of their employees were a self-organizing team. The \n\naverage team was comprised of twenty-three people and the median team of eleven. \n\n3.3.3. The importance of experimentation \n\nLarger corporations are on average less liberated. Some large companies decided to \n\nsplit every facility into smaller groups. However, this logic applies mostly to large \n\ncompanies that are already liberated (Semco, WL Gore, Sun Hydraulics, Favi). For \n\ncompanies that are not liberated yet but want to engage on the path of liberalization \n\n(Auchan, Michelin, Decathlon, Airbus) the process often starts with experimentations. \n\nIn his book, Fr\u00e9deric Laloux compares the development of Teal Organizations with \n\nthe process of evolution in nature. He explains that \u201cevolution is a formidable process \n\nthat brings forth unfathomable beauty and complexity not through a grand design, but \n\nby means of relentless, small-scale, parallel experimentation\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, p. \n\n291). \n\nThis can indeed be seen in large French corporations that recently decided to \n\nimplement some liberation principles. At Airbus, for example, the top management \n\nshowed a willingness to empower its employees. The CEO of Airbus Commercial, \n\nFabrice Br\u00e9gier expressed in 2012 an eagerness to \u201cgive more empowerment and on-\n\nthe-spot decision-making to our local teams to scrap bureaucracy and shorten lines of \n\ncommand.\u201d Therefore, in 2015 the director of the Saint Nazaire factory, Gerald Lignon \n\nstarted to innovate in terms of management within his factory of 2 800 employees. \n\nWhen Jean Luc Morfouace, head of operations for the A380 within this plant, came to \n\nhim to implement a pilot of \u201cempowerment\u201d on 600 employees, he responded: \u201cif you \n\nbelieve in it, go for it\u201d. In an interview in 2015, Gerald Lignon claimed to be \u201cthe pilot \n\nproject for the group Airbus\u201d on this concept of liberated companies. \n\nAs it can be seen in the table below, several large companies in France where the \n\ntop management shared a similar goodwill started implementing similar \n\nexperimentations on the base of volunteering.  \n\nFigure 10 Process of experimentation in large companies \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nName of the \n\ngroup \n\nNumber of employees \n\nin the group \n\nScale of the liberation experimentation \n\nAuchan 337 800 Fifteen supermarkets that volunteered \n\nMichelin 110 000 1 500 employees, in 6 different factories \n\nDecathlon 78 000 Two shops involved \n\nAirbus 55 000 A factory of 2 800 employees, and within \n\nthis facility, 600 workers \n\n \n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Laloux continues his comparison with the evolution process to express the \n\ngeneralization of these prototypes: \u201cSolutions are quickly iterated; what doesn\u2019t work \n\nis quickly discarded, and what works spreads quickly throughout the system\u201d \n\n(LALOUX, 2014, p. 292). What is interesting for the objective of this study is how \n\nthese companies then define a \u201cmodel\u201d of organization by identifying what works and \n\nwhat does not, before partially or totally replicating this model within the entire group. \n\nAirbus, to answer these questions, hired a work psychologist, Alison Caille. As \n\nexplained in the methodology, an interview with her was conducted, to better \n\nunderstand the challenges of defining a model in larger corporations. Her role is to \n\nobjectively evaluate what is working and what is not, through established scientific \n\nmethods. At the level of the factory of Gerald Lignon, feedback sessions on the success \n\nand drawbacks of the A380 experimentation on empowerment have already been \n\nconducted and inspired other initiatives within the factory. At the level of the group, it \n\nis still too early to say how the feedback and a potential generalization will happen.  \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Conclusion \n\nBy looking at the organizational structure of thirty-nine companies, the primary \n\nobjective of this research was to find consistencies in the organizational features of \n\nthese enterprises. This approach can help the liberating leaders who believe in the \n\nphilosophy of the liberated companies but believe its implementation is risky and \n\ncomplex, and are therefore in need of more elements to start designing their \n\norganizations. \n\nThe study contributed to this objective. It has led to the conclusion that some \n\npatterns are consistent in the organizational systems of liberated companies. Thirty-four \n\nout of the thirty-nine organization surveyed have at least half of the twenty-five patterns \n\nidentified, and with eleven patterns found in a range from seventy-four to one hundred \n\npercent of organizations surveyed, there is substantial evidence supporting the \n\nhypothesis. \n\nTherefore, if these patterns are not meant to be prescriptive, as Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Laloux \n\nexplains, \u201csome practices stand out as natural candidates that any founding team should \n\nat least consider\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, p. 261). Fourteen other features were classified as \n\ninconsistent, giving credit to the theory of I. Getz that each company has to construct \n\nits own organizational structure within a cultural context. \n\nThis study is a quantitative study based on a sample of 39 answers, among which \n\nonly four companies have been investigated before, when we have seen in the \n\nintroduction that the case studies were often overlapping in the existing literature. This \n\nnovelty allowed some findings that are quite different from the existing literature, \n\npaving the road for further research. For example, the feature of \u201cnot having a budget,\u201d \n\nwas not retained in our preliminary research as a primary characteristic of the 114 \n\nliberated companies of the universe. But since it was considered by F. Laloux as one of \n\nthe features of Teal organizations, we included this characteristic in our study, as \n\nexplained in the methodology section. However, this feature was rarely encountered, \n\nwith only 9% of the sample mentioning it. Reversely, profit-sharing, a feature not \n\nwidely commented in the literature, has been found in three-fourths of the companies \n\nof the sample. \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThis research has, however, some limitations. The main one is that there is no \n\ncontrol group. For example, eighty-nine percent of the companies of the sample don\u2019t \n\nhave a control department. However, fifty-nine percent of the sample is comprised of \n\ncompanies with fifty or less than fifty employees. It would be interesting to see what \n\npercentage of businesses of this size have a control department to infer insightful results \n\nfrom our sample. Likewise, forty-seven percent of companies in the sample have an \n\nexplicit conflict resolution process, and twenty-eight percent are letting their employees \n\nset their own salaries. Even if these figures are relatively small compared to other \n\nfeatures, they might be high in comparison to a more traditional organization. \n\nAs for future research, Isaac Getz and Frederic Laloux already investigated the \n\nnecessary conditions of a liberated company: The CEO must have adopted a worldview \n\nconsistent with the philosophy of a liberated company, and the owners must also \n\nunderstand and embrace these practices. These authors have also studied the importance \n\nof having a clear and inspiring purpose. \n\nThe risk of such organization is also described in the literature, both for employees \n\nand managers. For employees, F. Laloux explains that \u201csome people have been so \n\nscarred by years of command and control that they cannot seem to adjust to life without \n\na boss\u201d (LALOUX, 2014, p. 269). Bob Koski of Sun Hydraulics said that a liberated \n\ncorporate culture is for \u201cadults only\u201d, and Liisa Joronen of the liberated company SOL \n\nagreed that it is not for everyone and very tough on some people (GETZ, 2009). G. \n\nHamel also admits that \u201cnot everyone is suited to Morning Star\u2019s model\u201d and that \u201can \n\nindividual who has spent years working in a highly stratified organization often has \n\ndifficulty adjusting\u201d (HAMEL, 2011, p. 6). \n\nFurthermore, as Tom Peters (1992) noticed, \u201cit is managers who are having the \n\ntoughest time making the shift.\u201d The risk is for them to perceive changes as a loss of \n\npower. In 2008 the CEO of WL Gore, Terri Kelly, expressed that \u201cfor many folks, \n\ngiving up power and actually tapping into the knowledge, and not being a person that\u2019s \n\nin control and ultimately the decision maker, is scary\u201d (STERN, 2008, p. 2). \n\nThe research could, therefore, focus on the prevention of such risks, on the process \n\nof implementation of liberated practices (experimentation, feedback, risk-taking \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nenvironment), and on the results of such practices regarding engagement and financial \n\nperformance. \n\n  \n\n\n\n68 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5.
