In the present study we investigated the \nsomatic and sensory-motor development of the offspring from rat dams fed a HFD, compared with dams fed a control diet, during pregnancy \nor lactation. Indicators of the body growth, physical maturation, and reflex ontogeny were evaluated. Offspring of dams fed a HFD showed \nreduced weight and body growth, delayed physical maturation, and delayed maturation of the physiological reflexes, such as vibrissa placing, \nauditory startle response, and free-fall righting. Our findings suggest that maternal HFD during pregnancy or lactation modifies somatic and \nneurological development of the offspring, possibly increasing the risk of neuroendocrine and neuropsychiatric disorders later in life.\n\nKeywords: high fat diet, pregnancy, lactation, somatic growth, reflex ontogeny, offspring.\n\nresuMo:\nA exposi\u00e7\u00e3o materna a dieta rica em gordura (DRG) durante a gravidez e a amamenta\u00e7\u00e3o tem sido considerada um importante indutor de \naltera\u00e7\u00f5es da programa\u00e7\u00e3o normal da prole, em animais e humanos, e pode atrapalhar o desenvolvimento do c\u00e9rebro.

Sensory-motor development and nutritional programming\n\nthe \u201cbest window\u201d for  altering developmental or physiologi-\ncal programming7,8. In addition, according to epidemiologi-\ncal and experimental studies, nutritional status and/or ma-\nternal nutrition du ring prenatal and early postnatal periods \nplay an important role in epigenetic mechanisms involved \nin the developmental origins of non-communicable disea-\nse, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes \nand cardiovascular disorders9-11, and phenotypic plasticity \nin response to environmental cues9-11. Furthermore, recent \nstudies have demonstrated that the offspring from dams fed \nchronically with an HFD during the pregnancy and/or lac-\ntation showed changes in the hippocampal development, \nwith decreased neurogenesis, apoptosis and neuronal dif-\nferentiation5, and also neurobehavioral changes related to \nthe serotonergic and gabaergic neurotransmitter systems6. \nTherefore, dietary factors may produce synaptic changes \nduring development, similar to neurotoxins, possibly con-\ntributing to the increased incidence of neurodevelopmental \ndisorders12. Thus, the aim of the present study was to experi-\nmentally investigate the effects of the maternal HFD during \npregnancy or lactation periods on somatic and neurological \ndevelopment of the offspring.\n\nMetHoD\n\nAnimals and diets\nVirgin female albino Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus), (60 \n\ndays old) were taken from the colony of the Department of \nBiosciences, Federal University of Sao Paulo (Campus Baixada \nSantista). Before and during the mating, the females were fed \nad libitum with control diet (CD - standard laboratory chow ; \n52.2% carbohydrate, 23.0% protein and 14.7% lipids \u2013 Nuvilab  \n\u2013 Nuvital Nutrientes S/A; Curitiba, Parana, Brazil). Mating \nwas performed by housing females with adult males over-\nnight, and pregnancy was confirmed by exami ning vaginal \n\nsmears for the presence of sperm, designated as the day of \nconception, day 0 of pregnancy. Pregnant females were ran-\ndomly divided and maintained in individual polypropy lene \ncages in a room at 22\u00b0C\u00b11\u00b0C with lights on from 6:00 a.m. to \n6:00 p.m. Thus, the dams were fed with CD or high fat diet \n(HFD - standard laboratory chow enriched with lard mainly, \na few soybean oil and casein; 20.9% carbohydrate, 27.1% pro-\ntein and 52.0% lipids) during the pregnancy (P - Experiment \n1; 1st to 21st prenatal day) or lactation (L - Experiment 2; 1st to \n21st postnatal day). The maternal body weight was recorded \nduring the pregnancy (Figure 1A) and lactation (Figure 1B). \nBody weight was  obtained with an electronic scale (Marte, \nmodel S-100) with a sensitivity of 0.01g. The chemical com-\nposition of both  diets was outlined in Table 1. Twenty-four \nhours after birth (the birth day was considered post-natal \nday zero, PND 0), male and female pups born in the same \ndate, from different mothers, were randomly distributed in \nlitters of eight pups per dam. The pups were accessed from \neach reconstituted (randomized) litter, in order to prevent \ninbreeding. Each pup was labeled with a mark of methyl vio-\nlet solution on the skin, for identification during the experi-\nment. Seventy-two male Wistar rat pups (9 litters; 8 pups/\ndam/litter), weighing between 6 and 7 g were distributed into \nfour different groups according to maternal diet and deve-\nlopment period: offspring from dams fed a CD or HFD during \nthe pregnancy [groups (1) CD-P (n=16) and (2) HFD-P (n=24) \n- Experiment 1] or lactation [groups (3) CD-L (n=15) and (4) \nHFD-L (n=17) - Experiment 2]. The pups were weaned on \n21st post-natal day (PND 21) and separated according to sex. \nAfter weaning all offspring were fed control diet. \n\nThe experimental design of the present study is illustra-\nted in Figure 2. The litters (not each pup individually) were \ndaily (PND 1 to PND 21) separated from their mothers always \nbetween 10:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. for evaluation of somatic \ngrowth, physical features maturation and reflex ontogeny. \nDuring this period of daily testing sessions, the pups were \n\nFigure 1.

Testing and observation were conducted \nbetween 10:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. The progress of the indi-\nviduals was followed throughout the whole experiment. The \ntime of appearance for each reflex was defined to be the first \nday of its occurrence. Reflex maturation was measured by \nregistration of the age (days after birth) in which the reflex \nwas expressed for the first time. An exception was the palm \ngrasp, which was recorded the day of disappearance as a sign \nof maturation.\n\nstatistical analysis \nFor statistical analysis, data related to the somatic \n\ngrowth (body weight and length, medio-lateral and ante-\nroposterior head-axes) were analyzed by two-way repea-\nted-measures ANOVA. Bonferroni\u2019s post hoc test was used. \nUnpaired Student\u2019s t-test was used for data related to \nbody weight of the adult rat offspring, physical features \nma      turation and reflex testing. All data are expressed as \nmeans\u00b1standard deviation (SD). The level of significance was  \nset at P<0.05. \n\nresuLts\n\nsomatic growth \nThe body weight at birth of the offspring from HFD-P \n\ndams was 8% lower than controls (6.38\u00b10.43 g vs. 6.93\u00b10.69 g, \nrespectively) (P<0.005) and the body mass difference was \nmaintained throughout suckling (Figure 3A - Experiment 1). \nFurthermore, pups from HFD-L dams showed smaller body \n\nweight gain (P=0.001) from PND 7 (13.51\u00b10.70) to PND 21 \n(43.05\u00b13.08) when compared with controls (16.98\u00b14.11 and \n49.87\u00b18.10, respectively) (Figure 3B - Experiment 2). On the \nother hand, HFD adult offspring showed 11 to 19% (HFD-P \ngroup, P=0.001) and 9 to 23% (HFD-L group) (P=0.001) higher \nbody weight, when compared with controls (Figure 4 - Ex-\nperiments 1 and 2). \n\nThe offsprings suckled by HFD fed dams during preg-\nnancy showed lesser length than controls starting PND \n11 (78.66\u00b11.24 g vs. 84.12\u00b11.78 g, respectively) (P=0.001). \nReduced growth was observed throughout the lactation pe-\nriod (P=0.034) (Figure 3C - Experiment 1). In addition, the ne-\nonates breastfed by mothers exposed to HFD during lacta-\ntion showed growth deficit from PND 4 to PND 5 (P=0.001) \nand from PND 7 to PND 18 (P=0.001). However, shortly be-\nfore weaning, this difference disappeared (Figure 3D - Experi-\nment 2). The MLHA were reduced from PND 10 to PND 16 \n(P<0.04) in the offspring from HFD-P dams and from PND \n4 to PND 21 (P=0.001) in the pups from HFD-L dams, com-\npared with controls (Figure 3E and F - Experiments 1 and 2).  \nInterestingly, in the weaning, the HFD-P offspring showed \nMLHA higher than controls (20.10\u00b10.43 g vs. 19.72\u00b10.88 g, res-\npectively (P=0.014). Besides, the APHA were also decreased \nthroughout the su ckling for both HFD offspring (P=0.001) \n(Figure 3G and H - Experiments 1 and 2). \n\nPhysical features maturation and reflex testing\nFor physical features maturation, the HFD-P offspring \n\nwere delayed in respect to auditory conduit opening (P=0.001), \nand eruption of lower and upper incisors (P=0.020). On \nthe other hand, all the parameters evaluated for physical \nfeatures maturation in the HFD-L offspring were  delayed \n(P=0.001) when compared to controls pups (Table 3 - Ex -\nperiments 1 and 2). \n\nSimilarly, the reflex ontogeny of pups from both HFD fed \ndams during pregnancy or lactation were delayed in most \nreflexes (P<0.002), vibrissa placing, startle response, free fall \n\nTable 2.

Overweight \nlater in life; 3. Altered head growth; 4. Delayed reflex onto-\ngeny; and 5. Delayed acquisition of mature developmental \npatterns of physical features. These changes are similar to \nthose observed in the offspring of undernourished mothers14 \nand opposite to those observed in dams with overnutrition15. \n\nSeveral clinical and experimental studies have shown \nthat prenatal (intrauterine) and early postnatal maternal nu-\ntrition have a significant role on food intake, body weight \nand energy homeostasis of the offspring16,17. Pups of dams \nfed HFD during pregnancy and lactation showed low birth \nweight and reduced body weight during lactation, compa-\nred with controls16,18. According to Niculesco and Lupu [5], \nhigh fat diet-induced maternal obesity has impaired the \nintraute rine growth as determined by the low weight fetus. \nThe results of the present study are in line with previous in-\nvestigations, since the HFD offspring had reduced weight at \nbirth (only HFD-P; Experiment 1) and throughout lactation \n(HFD-P and HFD-L; Experiments 1 and 2).\n\nMoreover, the HFD pups in both experiments showed al-\ntered development of body length and cranial axes. Recent \nexperimental studies have demonstrated the influence of \n\nFigure 4.

In this context, pups \nfrom dams fed low protein diet showed reduced skull axes19, \nwhereas the offspring from mother fed with hypercaloric \nve getable oils supplemented diets during gestation and \n lactation showed shortened body length15. Thus, during ges-\ntation and/or lactation, the high saturated fat intake may be \nas harmful to the developing pups as undernutrition. In ad-\ndition, the dam rats fed with lard supplemented diets did not \nshow significant increases in body weight during the preg-\nnancy or suckling, despite more intakes of calories from fat \nin the HFD. Other results have suggested that pregnant rats \non a fat-enriched diet reduce their ingestion to maintain \nsimilar caloric intake compared with controls20. Keesey and \nHirvonen21 proposed the existence of a \u201cbody weight set-\npoint\u201d in rodents and humans so that body weight decrease \nor increase is corrected by altering food intake and energy ex-\npenditure to maintain the target body weight. Although this \nweight-control mechanism was not investigated in the pres-\nent study, it could explain the lack of significant effects on \ndam body weight.\n\nThe growth deficiencies (body weight and length, and \nhead axes) that we observed in offspring from dams fed \nHFD could be due to abnormalities of mammary gland \nfunction. In fact, Flint et al. observed that dams fed HFD \nshowed impaired mammary development and lactogene -\nsis22. HFD-induced changes observed in mammary gland \ninclude: 1. Abnormalities in alveolar development; 2. Lipid \n ac   cu mulation in the secretory epithelial cells, indicative of an \nabsence of copious milk secretion; 3. Decreased mRNA ex-\npression for ?-casein and ?-lactalbumin immediately post-\npartum; and 4. Reduced breast milk volume, a compensation \nmechanism due to high-energy diet22. These findings suggest \nthat, despite access to high-energy diet, dams fed HFD pro-\nduce an insufficient volume of breast milk which is also de-\nficient in proteins. These abnormalities may underlie the im-\npaired development of the offspring.\n\nInterestingly, we observed that the offspring of dams fed \nHFD showed reduced body weight curves in early life and \noverweight later in life. Several studies support this finding.  \nPups from female rats fed HFD during pregnancy  and suck-\nling had low birth weight and reduced plasma leptin in PND \n2, but became obese and showed increased plasma leptin \nin adulthood23. Moreover, adult offspring from mothers fed \nHFD (during the same periods) showed hypertension, hyper-\ncholesterolemia, hyperphagia, overweight, increased visceral \nfat, liver weight, blood glucose and triglycerides7-11. These ab-\nnormalities could be associa ted with alterations of hypotha-\nlamic development. The central role of the hypo thalamus in \ncontrolling food intake is well re cognized. Ne vertheless, the \nhypothalamus has been considered to have a role in altering \nphysiological programming, particularly associated to early \nnutritional manipulation17. Furthermore, the prenatal and \n\nearly postnatal periods are critical for regulation of expres-\nsion of hypothalamic orexigenic neuropeptides and their re-\nceptors, which also can be programmed by factors related to \nmaternal diet24. Therefore we believe that overweight in the \nadult HFD offspring observed in the present study may be as-\nsociated with alterations of hypothalamic development.\n\nThe offspring of dams fed HFD also showed some adverse \neffects in physical and neurobehavioral outcomes, including \naltered development of all studied physical features (except \near unfolding and eyes opening to HFD-P group), palm grasp \nreflex (only HFD-P group), vibrissa placing, startle response, \nnegative geotaxis (only HFD-L group), and free fall righting. \nThese findings suggest impairment of sensory-motor sys-\ntem and may reflect a vulnerability of the developing brain \nto changes in maternal diet. Accordingly, many authors have \nshown that the importance of maternal overnutrition for fe-\ntal and newborn brain development is increasingly recog-\nnized. Studies have suggested that maternal obesity or ma-\nternal exposure to HFDs, during pregnancy and lactation \nperiods, may permanently alter brain structure and function \nin the offspring5,6 and this change could affect the sensory-\nmotor development.\n\nMoreover, the results of the present work corroborate \nthose of Soares et al.25 that observed delayed somatic and re-\nflex development in suckling rats from dams fed with keto-\ngenic diet associated with lack of protein. In other study, the \noffspring from dams fed with vegetable oils supplemented \ndiets (soy and sunflower oils) during gestation and lactation \nshowed delayed puberty onset and poor cliff avoidance be-\nhavior15, partly corroborating our results. The authors of that \nstudy observed some beneficial effects on physical and reflex \nmaturation15. However, the beneficial effects were associa-\nted with the maternal high intake of polyunsaturated fatty \nacids (w-6 and w-3), unlike our findings, because we used lard \n(saturated fatty acids) as source of fat. These results suggest \nthat different types of maternal HFD may produce different \neffects on offspring development.\n\nThe placenta plays a crucial role in the transport of bioac-\ntive molecules from mother to fetus26. Maternal lipids can \nbe transferred across the placenta and are accumulated in \nthe brain and other organs during fetal development27. On \nthe other hand, also more interestingly, changes in dietary \nfat content modify milk lipid content and daily milk lipid \nproduction in lactating animals28. It seems that in both si-\ntuations the offspring\u2019s brain development may be vulnerable \nto the effects of lipotoxicity or lipid peroxidation induced by \nmaternal high-fat intake3. In addition, the lipotoxicity resul-\nting from maternal HFD is capable of activating a number \nof stress signaling cascades including pro-inflammatory cy-\ntokines and oxidative stress3,8, which can damage the neuro-\ndevelopment of the offspring5. In this context, some experi-\nmental studies have demonstrated: 1. Reduced proliferation \nof hippocampal dentate gyrus progenitor cells (pH3-labeled \n\n\n\n143Cristiano Mendes-da-Silva et al. Sensory-motor development and nutritional programming\n\ncells)5; 2. Decreased apoptosis and neuronal differentiation in \nspecific hippocampal areas5; and 3. Morphofunctional chan-\nges of gabaergic and serotonergic neurotransmitter systems6. \nIn studies Sullivan et al.29 Raibstein-and Peleg et al.6 were \ndemonstrated up-regulation of the 5-HT1A inhibitory auto-\nreceptor in the offspring of dams fed HFD. In the first29, the \nauthors observed increased expression of 5-HT1A receptors \nin the dorsal raphe nucleus in nonhuman primates. On the  \nother hand, in the second study researchers showed ex-\npression high of 5-HT1A in ventral hippocampus. These neu-\nrochemical changes can promote suppression of the se-\nrotonergic system in the offspring HFD, since the 5-HT1A \n\nauto-receptor inhibits the release of serotonin6,29 and thus \nperhaps result in the sensory and motor disorders found in \nthe present paper. This set of results and findings indicate \nthat prenatal and/or early postnatal exposure to HFD may \nimpair brain development, possibly affecting sensory and \nmotor functions. \n\n Results of the present study suggest that lipotoxicity  \ninduced by maternal HFD may affect the cerebellum and \nvestibular system. In fact, the reflex\u00a0 ontogeny reflects \n sensory-motor development and integrity of vestibulocere-\nbellar system, which integrate exteroceptive input (vibris-\nsae) and locomotor output30, and may be affected by nutri-\ntional manipulations31. In general, since neonatal reflexes \n\nmay be considered as an index of brain maturation, the pre-\nsent findings reinforce the notion that maternal nutrition af-\nfects prenatal and early postnatal mechanisms responsible \nfor normal brain development14,15,25. In another hypothesis, \nperhaps the delay in the somatic and neurobehavioral de-\nvelopment of the offspring HFD may be related to neural \nstem cells (NSCs) loss due to the effect of pro-inflammatory \ninduced by early exposure to high-fat diet, as evidenced hy-\npothalamic NSCs32. \n\nIn summary, the present study demonstrates that mater-\nnal HFD during gestation or lactation impaired similarly the \nsomatic and neurological development of the offspring, wi-\nthout significant differences between prenatal and postnatal \nmanipulation. This neurodevelopmental damage may reflect \nin neuropsychiatric disorders later in life, such as psychomo-\ntor, behavioral and cognitive disturbances5,6,25. Nevertheless, \nfurther studies are needed to better elucidate the underlying \nneural and molecular mechanisms involved in this process.\n\nAckNoWLeDGMeNts\n\nThe authors thank Mrs. F\u00e1bio Tadeu Montesano and \nFelipe Granado de Souza for technical assistance in statisti-\ncal analysis. \n\nreferences\n\n1.
